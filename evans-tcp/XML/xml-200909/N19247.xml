<HEAD>FROM THE CRITICAL REVIEW, For September, 1788.</HEAD>
<Q><P>OUR Author, with great candour and extensive knowledge of the subject, discusses the doctrine of eter∣nal punishments. He thinks that there will be a period when every sinner will be restored to the Divine favour. This doctrine is perfectly consistent with the benevo∣lence of the Deity. It is supported by many wise and good men; nor is there any reason to suppose that it will be perverted to serve the purposes of vice and immora∣lity. Mr. Winchester, in his defence of it, shews much charity, much humanity, and no little share of learning: The fifth Dialogue alone, which relates to the design and tendency of punishment, might furnish some little foundation for a difference of opinion; but, in a questi∣on so greatly above human attainment, the mind would be lost in the enquiry, and not greatly benefited by the discussion. The question of the universal Restoration, must be examined as Mr. Winchester has done, by the word of God, as revealed at different times, and parti∣cularly in the Gospel.</P></Q>
<P>N. B. A considerable part of the fifth Dialogue, being printed in the Lectures on the Prophecies, is left out of this edition, and the remaining part is included in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fourth Dialogue.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>AS I now present my Friends and the Public with a new edition of the Dialogues on the UNIVERSAL RESTORATION, which by many has been long desired, perhaps it may be acceptable to some for me to give a brief account how I came first to the knowledge of this part of the counsel of God, which I have not shunned freely to de∣clare, both by word and writing, as I have found opportunity and necessity.</P>
<P>I think it was in the beginning of the year 1778, being in South Carolina, upon the River <HI>Pee Dee,</HI> where I was at that time Minister, that I called to see a friend, who first put into my hands that va∣luable book written by <HI>Paul Siegvolk,</HI> and which is called <HI>The Everlasting Gospel,</HI> of which I have lately published a new edition. I was desired to tell what it meant to hold forth, as my friend could not tell by any means what to make of it on the account of the singularity and strangeness of the sentiments therein contained; although the language is very plain and clear, and by no means dark, mystical, or obscure.</P>
<P>I opened the book as I was desired, and dipping into it here and there, for half an hour perhaps, was very soon able to tell what the Author aimed at, viz. <HI>that there would be a final end of sin and
<PB N="iv" REF="025050_0004_102D75B2C3F7DE80"/>
misery, and that all fallen creatures would be restored, by Jesus Christ, to a state of holiness and happiness, after such as were rebellious had suffered in proportion to their crimes.</HI> I had never seen any thing of the sort before in all my life; and I seemed struck with several ideas that I glanced over, such as the inconsistency and impossibility of both good and evil always existing in the universe; and es∣pecially his observations upon the word <HI>eternal</HI> or <HI>everlasting,</HI> shewing that it was used for what ne∣ver had a beginning, and would never have an end, as the being and perfections of God; and that it was also applied to things which had a be∣ginning, but should never have an end, as the be∣ing and happiness of the righteous; and, that it was also frequently used to express things, times, and seasons which had both beginning and end. which he therefore called <HI>periodical eternities,</HI> and gave a great number of instances of this sort, which could not be denied; and he contended that the <HI>everlasting punishment</HI> threatened to the wicked, did not belong to the first, nor to the second, but to the third class of these durations.</P>
<P>But as I was only desired to tell what the au∣thor meant, when I had satisfied my friend in that respect, I laid the book down, and I believe, we both concluded it to be a pleasant ingenious hy∣pothesis, but had no serious thoughts of its being true; and for my part, I determined not to trou∣ble myself about it, or to think any thing more of the matter. And as the book had been sent a considerable distance for my friend to read, I sup∣pose it was soon after sent back; for I saw it no more, nor heard any thing farther about it. The The following summer I went a journey into <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="025050_0005_102D702A9D161F08"/>
and happening to mention the subject to a minister there, he told me that a few years before, it had been a subject of controversy in the public papers, between a clergyman, who defended, and a gentleman of the law, who denied the proper <HI>endless</HI> eternity of punishment; and he told me that this gentleman who denied it, had advanced, that the translators of the Bible had rendered the very same Greek word, by very different English words, sometimes rendering it <HI>for ever,</HI> and some∣times <HI>world;</HI> and that if they had always uni∣formly rendered it by one English word, it would have been evident to all readers, that no argu∣ment for <HI>endless misery,</HI> could have been drawn therefrom. I was told also while I was in <HI>Vir∣ginia,</HI> that a clergyman of the episcopal church, had a few years before, given out that he had some wonderful thing to make known to his hear∣ers, which he would preach upon some Sunday, but did not mention when. This raised the pub∣lic curiosity, and great numbers attended his place of worship in hopes of hearing what this wonderful thing might be; but for a considera∣ble time the matter was undiscovered. But at last he gave out, that on the next Sunday he would open this great secret. Vast numbers of people flocked to hear what it could be; When he came to declare what it was, behold! it was a wonder∣ful piece of news indeed, such as had never been heard before in any pulpit in <HI>Virginia.</HI> It was nothing short of the doctrine of the <HI>Restoration.</HI> I think, to the best of my remembrance, they told me, that he opened and enlarged upon it for two Sundays, and never preached any more, being immediately after seized with sickness, which ter∣minated
<PB N="vi" REF="025050_0006_102D75B4FB4293F8"/>
in his death. And this was generally esteemed as a judgment that fell upon him for daring to preach such a wicked, false, and dange∣rous opinion; and that God cut him off from the land of the living, to testify his displeasure a∣gainst him; and to terrify others from daring to follow his example, or believe his sentiments. But perhaps this might have been some worthy, learned, pious man, who had long concealed this grand truth in his heart, and had derived much satisfaction therefrom, and longed to proclaim it to others, for their good. And at last, notwith∣standing the opposition that he might expect, re∣solved so to do; and accordingly was enabled, just before his time came to depart out of this world, to bear a faithful testimony to this most grand and important of all God's purposes. And having performed his duty, his master called him to receive his reward, and gave him the glorious plaudit of, 'Well done, thou good and faithful servant;—enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.'</P>
<P>As for the vain judgments of men they are not to be regarded. 'For they know not the thoughts of the Lord, neither understand they his counsel.' 'But the souls of the righteous are in the hand of God, and there shall no torment touch them. In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die; and their departure is taken for misery. And their going from us to be utter destruction; but they are in peace. For though they be punished in the sight of men, yet is their hope full of immortality. And having been a little chastised, they shall be greatly rewarded; for God proved them, and found them worthy for himself. As gold in the furnace hath he tried them, and hath received them as a burnt-offering.
<PB N="vii" REF="025050_0007_102D702C4A7DAB40"/>
And in the time of their visitation, they shall shine, and run to and fro, like sparks among the stubble. They shall judge the nations, and have dominion over the people, and their Lord shall reign for ever. They that put their trust in him shall understand the truth; and such as be faithful in love shall abide with him: for grace and mercy is to his saints, and he hath care for his elect.' 'But though the righteous be pre∣vented with death, yet shall he be in rest.'</P>
<P>I am apt to think therefore, that this minister was one of uncommon faith and love, and as he be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed God, so he loved mankind, and wished them to know the amazing riches of their Re∣deemer's love towards them: and when he had openly delivered this testimony, he was called to his rest.</P>
<P>Indeed if the enemies of this doctrine had been true prophets, I should have died and gone to hell long ago; for no sooner was it known I had embraced it, but some gave out that I would not live a year; but I have already lived eleven. One of my old friends desired me to take particular no∣tice of what he said, which he expressed in these words, 'Mind what I tell you. In six months from this time, you will turn Deist, and deny all re∣vealed religion: and in twelve months you will turn Atheist, deny the being of God, and abandon yourself to all kinds of open wickedness.' Blessed be God, this has also proved false. And they ge∣nerally seemed to agree to prophesy certain dam∣nation to me whenever I should depart out of this world. But I trust this is equally false, 'For I know whom I have believed, (or trusted) and am
<PB N="viii" REF="025050_0008_102D75B6EF00D258"/>
persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.'</P>
<P>But to return to my narrative,</P>
<P>Sometime after I returned back to <HI>South-Caro∣lina,</HI> a Physician with whom I had been acquaint∣ed in <HI>Virginia,</HI> came to live in the parish where I was minister; and among his books I found <HI>the Everlasting Gospel,</HI> by <HI>Paul Siegvolk;</HI> this was the second copy that had fell in my way, and I read a little more therein, but as yet had not the least thought that ever I should embrace his sentiments; yet some of his arguments appeared very conclu∣sive, and I could not wholly shake them off, but I concluded to let them alone, and not investi∣gate the matter; and therefore I never gave the book even so much as one cursory reading, till with great difficulty I procured one in the city of Philadelphia, more than two years afterwards.</P>
<P>In the year 1779, I found myself much stirred up to exhort my fellow creatures to repent, be∣lieve, and obey the Gospel, and began to adopt a more open and general method of preaching than I had used for some years before; having been deemed one of the most consistent Calvinists upon the continent, much upon the plan of Dr. <HI>Gill,</HI> whom I esteemed almost as an oracle. But now my heart being opened, and viewing the worth of souls, I felt great compassion towards them, and invited them with all my might to fly for mercy to the arms of Christ, who died for them, and who was willing to save them. I was gradually led into this way of preaching, without considering any thing about its consistency with strict calvinism, but finding myself very happy and comfortable in my own mind, and that this
<PB N="ix" REF="025050_0009_102D702E242E7B50"/>
method of preaching was highly useful, I conti∣nued to go in the same course.</P>
<P>About this time I began to find uncommon de∣sires for the conversion and salvation of the poor negroes, who were very numerous in that part of the country; but whom none of my predecessors, that I could learn, had ever taken pains to instruct in the principles of Christianity; neither had any single slave, either man, or woman been baptized until that summer, in the whole parish (which was very large) that I ever heard of.</P>
<P>The prejudices which the slaves had against Christianity, on account of the severities practised upon them by professing Christians, both ministers and people, might be one principal reason why they could not be brought to attend to religious instructions. But they had no prejudice against me on that score, as I never had any thing to do with slavery, but on the contrary condemned it; and this being pretty generally known, operated so upon the minds of those poor creatures, that they shewed a disposition to attend my ministry, more than they had ever shewed to any other. But still I never had addressed them in particular, and indeed had hardly any hopes of doing them good. But one evening seeing a great number of them at the door of the house where I was preach∣ing, I found myself constrained as it were, to go to the door, and tell them, That Jesus Christ loved them, and died for them, as well as for us white people, and that they might come and be∣lieve in him, and welcome. And I gave them as warm and pressing an invitation as I could, to comply with the glorious gospel. This short dis∣course addressed immediately to them, took great∣er
<PB N="x" REF="025050_0010_102D75B8DA85BFC8"/>
effect than can well be imagined. There were about thirty from one plantation in the neighbour∣hood present; (besides others) these returned home, and did not even give sleep to their eyes, as they afterwards informed me, until they had settled every quarrel among themselves, and ac∣cording to their form of marriage, had married e∣very man to the woman with whom he lived; had restored whatever one had unjustly taken from a∣nother; and determined from that time to seek the Lord diligently. From that very evening they began constantly to pray to the Lord, and so con∣tinued; and he was found of them. I continued to instruct them, and within three months from the first of June, I baptized more than thirty blacks belonging to that plantation, besides as many others, as in the whole made up one hun∣dred, of which sixty three were men, and thirty-seven were women, all which were born in <HI>Afri∣ca,</HI> or immediately descended from such as were natives of that unhappy country.</P>
<P>My preaching was not only useful to the poor slaves, but also to great numbers of the white people, of whom I baptized upon profession of repentance and faith in Christ, about one hundred and thirty-nine persons within the same space. This was a summer of great success, and I shall remember that happy season with pleasure while I live. This summer I received some farther dawn∣ings of the day of the general Restoration in my mind, for upon considering several Scriptures, such as these, 'He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied; by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many; for he shall bear their iniquities,' Isai. liii. 11. 'After this I beheld,
<PB N="xi" REF="025050_0011_102D702FECBDF6D8"/>
lo, a great multitude, which no man could num∣ber, of all nations, and kindreds, and peoples, and tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands' Rev. vii. 9. I became fully per∣suaded that the number of the finally saved would equal, if not exceed the number of the lost. And I was so forcibly impressed with this new and very joyful discovery, that I not only conversed in that strain privately, but boldly preached it in the con∣gregation, which generally consisted of nearly a thousand persons upon Sundays. Some of the people to whom I had mentioned something re∣specting the sentiment, thought that I was going at once to declare myself in favour of the <HI>general Restoration.</HI> But that was as yet far from being the case; though some of the arguments which I had glanced upon in that book, <HI>the Everlasting Gospel,</HI> would frequently present themselves to my mind in such a forcible manner that I could scarcely withstand their evidence.</P>
<P>In the month of September I left <HI>South-Caroli∣na,</HI> on a visit to my friends in <HI>New England,</HI> in∣tending however to return to my people again; but to prevent their being left destitute, I procur∣ed the Rev. Mr. <HI>Botsford</HI> to come and supply them, upon this condition, that whenever I should re∣turn, he should resign the congregation to me a∣gain, if I required it. But he has remained the constant Pastor ever since. I then travelled slow∣ly through the continent preaching to the peo∣ple, and conversing with my friends, to whom sometimes in private I proposed some of the argu∣ments in favour of the <HI>general Restoration,</HI> which I had read in the <HI>Everlasting Gospel,</HI> on purpose
<PB N="xii" REF="025050_0012_102D75BA6F587FA8"/>
see what answers they could give; and this I did especially to able ministers; but to my surprise often found them quite at a stand, not knowing what to say. And some were almost overpower∣ed, with even the weak manner in which I was capable of holding forth the arguments in favour of the <HI>Restoration.</HI> And oftentimes the answers that some of the greatest men gave, were such as tended to increase my doubts respecting <HI>endless misery,</HI> rather than to remove them. I remember once, that I asked the Rev. Mr. <HI>Manning,</HI> Presi∣dent of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> College, and who was at that time one of my dearest friends, what was the strongest argument that he could use in favour of the doctrine of endless misery? He answered, That it was the nature of God, to lay the great∣est possible restraint upon sin, and therefore he had threatened it with <HI>endless punishment,</HI> as the highest restraint he could possibly lay upon it. This argument is answered in the third Dialogue. Thus after much seeking I could find no satisfac∣tion in the matter; but still my doubts increased. Notwithstanding, I withstood the doctrine of the <HI>Restoration</HI> with all my might, and sometimes preach∣ed publicly against it with all the force I could mus∣ter. Yet there was something in its favour that gained gradually upon my mind, and sometimes brought me to be almost willing to embrace it. I plainly saw that it would reconcile almost, if not quite, all the difficulties of other systems; and I thought if I should ever receive it, I should be able to preach much easier, and more freely than ever, and with far greater satisfaction, which by experience, I have since found to be true. The ideas were some∣times so transporting to me, even while I professed
<PB N="xiii" REF="025050_0013_102D758CE78366F8"/>
to oppose the sentiment, that I have been constrain∣ed to set them forth in the most sublime manner that I was able; and sometimes so as actually to bring them who heard me converse upon the sub∣ject to believe and rejoice in the <HI>Universal Restora∣tion,</HI> while I thought myself an opposer of it, and only proposed the arguments in its favour to see what effect they would have on such who never heard them before. And I was often carried away before I was aware, even while I intended only to let my friends hear what might be said. I remember once, while I was at my father's table in the year 1780, that I mentioned the doctrine of the <HI>Restoration,</HI> and finding that none in company had ever so much as heard of such a scheme, I began to hold it forth, produced many arguments in its favour, brought up many objections, answer∣ed them in such a manner as astonished all present, and I was amazed at myself, I spoke with so much ease and readiness as I had hardly ever experienced before on any occasion. Nay, I was so much ani∣mated with the subject that I said, That I did not doubt but that in sixty years time, that very doc∣trine would universally be preached, and generally embraced in that very country, and would certain∣ly prevail over all opposition.</P>
<P>This discourse made a greater impression upon the minds of those who heard it, and upon my own also, than I intended; and though I after∣wards used the best arguments I could in favour of the common opinion, yet I found them insuffi∣cient wholly to remove the effects of what I had before said.</P>
<P>After spending about twelve months in the most delightful manner, constantly journeying and
<PB N="xiv" REF="025050_0014_102D75BC95E17890"/>
preaching with great success, to vast multitudes of people in my native country, I set off with inten∣tion to return towards <HI>South-Carolina.</HI> On the way I tarried some time at the house of the Rev. Mr. <HI>Samuel Waldo,</HI> in <HI>Pawling's Precinct,</HI> state of <HI>New-York,</HI> whose kind and friendly behaviour to∣wards me I remember with pleasure, and mention with gratitude. I had a great deal of very agree∣able conversation with him upon the matter, and he did not seem to oppose the ideas hardly at all; but only gently cautioned me against receiving any thing erroneous. He is a man of a most excel∣lent spirit, and his family was upon the whole the most delightful, agreeable, and happy family that I ever knew. While I was at his house one of his children, then about twenty years of age, seemed fully convinced of the truth of the doctrine, by listening to our conversation, and was filled with great joy at the idea. Several religious men who were on a journey, lodged at the house while I was there, got a hint of the matter, and wished to hear all that I could say in defence of it; I ac∣cordingly gave them some of the principal argu∣ments in its favour, and obviated some of the most capital objections that could be brought against it; and I afterwards overheard them wishing that they had not been so curious as to have enquired so far into the subject, for they could not resist the argu∣ments, although they seemed resolved to treat the sentiment as an error.</P>
<P>In this state of mind, half a convert to the doc∣trine of the <HI>Restoration,</HI> I arrived in the city of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> on the 7th of October, 1780. I in∣tended to have left the city in a few days, and to have gone on towards <HI>South-Cnrolina,</HI> but the Bap∣tist
<PB N="xv" REF="025050_0015_102D758EC8815A58"/>
church being destitute of a minister, they in∣vited me to stop and preach with them, to which I was at length persuaded, and for some time I was much followed, and there were great additions to the church. The congregations increased in such a manner, especially on Sunday-evenings, that our place of worship, though large, would by no means contain them; at length leave was asked by some of my friends for me to preach in the church of St. Paul, in that city, which was granted. This was one of the largest houses of worship in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and equal in bigness to most of the churches in <HI>London.</HI> I think I preached there about eighteen sermons, and generally to very crowded audiences, frequently more than could possibly get into the house; most of the clergy, of every de∣nomination in the city, heard me there, and many thousands of different people. I am inclined to think, that I never preached to so many before nor since as I did sometimes in that house, and with almost universal approbation. But now the time of my trouble and casting down came on, and thus it was.</P>
<P>Soon after I arrived in the city I had enquired of some friend for <HI>The Everlasting Gospel,</HI> which I could not light on for some time, but they lent me Mr. <HI>Stonehouse's</HI> book upon the <HI>Reslitution of all Things,</HI> which I had never seen nor heard of be∣fore; this very learned work I read with great care, and his reasoning, arguments, and scripture-proofs seemed to me entirely satisfactory.</P>
<P>The friends who procured me the works of Mr. <HI>Stonehouse,</HI> were concerned at my having an incli∣nation to read any thing upon such a subject; ne∣vertheless, though there were several of them with
<PB N="xvi" REF="025050_0016_102D75BEC18E4120"/>
whom I conversed pretty freely upon the matter, and who knew of my reading Mr. <HI>Stonehouse's</HI> works, yet they behaved in so friendly a manner towards me, that they never mentioned a word of it to any, until by other means it come to be known and talked of.</P>
<P>In the house where I lodged, when I first came to the city I had, in the freedom of conversation, and with some appearance of joy, expressed myself in general terms upon the subject, but always in the exact words of Scripture, or in such a manner as this, viz. That I could not help hoping that God would finally bring <HI>every knee to bow,</HI> and <HI>every tongue</HI> to <HI>swear:</HI> and that <HI>at the name of Je∣sus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth; and things under the earth; and that every tongue</HI> should <HI>confess</HI> JESUS CHRIST to be <HI>Lord to the glory of God the Father.</HI> And that I hoped, <HI>that in the dispensation of the fulness of times, he might gather together in one all things in</HI> CHRIST, <HI>both which are in heaven, and which are on earth,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Such passages as these I mentioned in this man∣ner, hoping that they would be fulfilled. The people of the house seemed surprised, and asked me if I believed so: I answered, 'That sometimes I could not help hoping that it might be so.' I could hardly have imagined among friends, that any danger could have arisen from my expressing a hope that the Scriptures were true.</P>
<P>However these false friends told a minister, whom for a number of years I had esteemed as my best and most intimate friend, that I was turned heretic, and believed the doctrine of the <HI>Universal Restoration,</HI> and desired him to convince me. Some
<PB N="xvii" REF="025050_0017_102D75908BBF7240"/>
time after he met with me in the street, and in a very abrupt manner told me, that he had wanted to see me for some time, that he might give me a piece of his mind; that he had been informed by such a person, that I was inclined to the doctrine of the <HI>Universal Restoration,</HI> and then, instead of using any argument to convince me, or taking any method for my recovery, added this <HI>laconic</HI> speech, 'If you embrace this sentiment, I shall no longer own you for a brother.' And he has hitherto been as good as his word, having never written nor spoken to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from that day to this; and when I have since offered to shake hands with him, he has refused; and yet he was one whom I esteemed above any other on earth, as a hearty, sincere, long-tried, and faithful friend. If my intimate friend treated me in such a manner, what had I not to expect from my open and avowed ene∣mies?</P>
<P>I now foresaw the storm, and I determined to prepare for it, not by denying what I had said, but by examining and determining for myself, whether the sentiment was according to Scripture or not. If I found that it was not, I was deter∣mined to retract, but if it was, to hold it fast, let the consequences be what they might. I had now no time to lose, I expected in a short time to be called to an account, and examined respecting this doctrine, and obliged either to <HI>defend</HI> or <HI>deny</HI> it; I was already too well persuaded that it was true, to do the latter without hesitation, and yet not suffi∣ciently for the former. For this purpose, I shut myself up chiefly in my chamber, read the Scrip∣tures, and prayed to God to lead me into all truth, and not suffer me to embrace any error; and I
<PB N="xviii" REF="025050_0018_102D75C08906E5D8"/>
think that with an upright mind, I laid myself open to believe whatever the Lord had revealed. It would be too long to tell all the teachings I had on this head; let it suffice, in short, to say, That I became so well persuaded of the truth of the <HI>Universal Restoration,</HI> that I was determined never to deny it, let it cost me ever so much, though all my numerous friends should forsake me, as I expected they would, and though I should be dri∣ven from men, and obliged to dwell in caves or dens of the earth, and feed on wild roots and ve∣getables, and suffer the lose of all things, friends, wealth, fame, health, character, and even life itself. The truth appeared to me more valuable than all things, and as I had found it, I was determined never to part with it, let what would be offered in exchange.</P>
<P>I had now formed my resolution, and was de∣termined how to act when the trial came. Hitherto I had said nothing about the <HI>Restoration</HI> in public, and but little in private; but I preached up the death of Christ, and salvation for mankind through him, without restriction. This free manner of preaching gave offence to some, who came to hear me no more. On the evening of the 22d of Janu∣ary 1781, a number of the members of the church, who had heard that I held the doctrine of the <HI>Restoration,</HI> met me at a friend's house, to ask me the question, Whether I did or not? I acknow∣ledged that I did, but did not wish to trouble any body with my sentiments. They desired me neither to preach them in public, nor to converse of them in private. I told them, That if they would pre∣vent people from asking me, I would say nothing upon the matter; but if people asked me concern∣ing
<PB N="xix" REF="025050_0019_102D75928D393D18"/>
my sentiments, I could not deny them, and if they wished to know the reasons, I must inform them. And thus the matter was to rest; but some that were present, wished to know the foundation of my sentiments, others opposed it, not wishing to hear any thing in its favour. At length it was agreed that I might read the passages of Scripture upon which I judged the doctrine of the <HI>Restora∣tion</HI> to be founded, but must not add a single word of explanation on my part, and on their parts they were not to ask any questions, or make the least opposition, for if they did, I insisted upon the li∣berty of defending.</P>
<P>Accordingly I took the Bible, and read many passages in the Old and New Testaments, which I judged to contain the doctrine; and the very read∣ing of them convinced several of the company of the truth of the <HI>Restoration.</HI> There was nothing farther took place at that time: we parted with a mutual agreement; I was not to preach it in the pulpit, nor to introduce it in conversation, but I would not be obliged to deny it, when asked, nor to refuse to vindicate it, if opposed: and on their parts they were not to speak of it to my prejudice, but to endeavour as much as possible, to keep the the matter close, and so we parted. But notwith∣standing all the pains that could be taken, the matter got abroad, and several came to discourse with me on my principles, to whom I gave such reasons as I was able for what I believed. A lit∣tle after this time, I met with another copy of the <HI>Everlasting Gospel,</HI> which I then read through with attention for the first time, and found much satis∣faction; the arguments and Scripture proofs therein contained, seemed to me sufficient to con∣vince
<PB N="xx" REF="025050_0020_102D75C2393C6F70"/>
all that would read with candour and atten∣tion.</P>
<P>I still continued to act only on the defensive, not preaching upon the subject, nor going about to private houses to make interest in my favour; but if any came to me and wished me to discourse upon it, I would not refuse; and thus a number were convinced of its truth, while others violently op∣posed it. And thus matters continued until the latter end of March. Having heard that the Ger∣man Baptists in <HI>Germantown,</HI> about 8 miles from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> held the doctrine of the <HI>Restoration,</HI> I had appointed to spend the first Sunday in April with them; and this engagement had been made sometime. Just as I was ready to go out of the city on Saturday, I found that some of the mem∣bers of the Church had privately sent into the country, and collected a number of the ablest mi∣nisters, who were arrived in the city on purpose to debate, I gave them the liberty of my pulpit as they pleased for the next day, and went out of the city to go to <HI>Germantown;</HI> and took that opportu∣nity to go and visit that ancient, venerable, and ex∣cellent man, Dr <HI>George De Benneville,</HI> who receiv∣ed me in the most kind, open, and friendly manner; and his conversation was most highly edifying to me. Afterwards I went to <HI>Germantown,</HI> and lodged there all night, ready to preach the next day. As soon as my enemies in <HI>Philadelphia</HI> found that I was gone out of the city, they spread a re∣port that I had fled to avoid an interview with these ministers, who had come on purpose to con∣vince me. Nothing could have been more false, than such a report, for I had been engaged to go to <HI>Germantown,</HI> on that day, for several weeks
<PB N="xxi" REF="025050_0021_102D759428B2DA90"/>
beforehand: I knew nothing of these Ministers be∣ing sent for until they came to town; and I had no fear but I should be able, by God's assistance, to defend the cause before them; and besides, I had appointed to return on Monday, and did re∣turn accordingly. The whole Church met, both my friends and my opposers, and these Ministers met with them. I was called to attend a funeral at the time, and was at the house of mourning, when a messenger was sent in haste, to desire my immediate attendance at the meeting without any delay. I found that those who were my enemies in the assembly, had been greatly vaunting over my friends, because I was not present. They said I had absconded merely to avoid a debate, in which I was sure to be confuted, as here was an oppor∣tunity that might never present itself again; and seven wise, able, and learned Ministers had assem∣bled on purpose to dispute with me, but that I had gone, and left my adherents in the lurch, from a consciousness that I was not able to defend my cause; with abundance more to the same purpose. My friends, on the other hand, told them, That I was afraid of nothing but sin, and that they doubted not of my being able and willing to dis∣pute with any one of the gentlemen, or all of them, one by one, if they chose it. O, no; they repli∣ed, they knew better than that, I was gone out of the way on purpose, where I could not be found. My friends told them, That if there was a vote past in the assembly that I should dispute with any one, they would engage that I would be among them in a few minutes. It was accordingly una∣nimously voted, that I should dispute with the <HI>Rev. Mr. Boggs,</HI> upon my sentiments, in the pre∣sence
<PB N="xxii" REF="025050_0022_102D75C454842E98"/>
of these Ministers, and of the whole assem∣bly. But when in a few minutes I came in, and took my place, what different countenances ap∣peared in the congregation? All my friends were highly pleased, and the others were as much con∣founded and disappointed, at seeing me come in so chearfully and quickly, after they had made them∣selves so sure, that I would not come. But sure∣ly, I might have been looked upon with pity; alone to answer for myself, no one to support me; while my antagonists were seven of the ablest Mi∣nisters that could be obtained. I felt, however, that inward composure, from a consciousness of having acted uprightly and sincerely in the whole affair, that even caused my countenance to appear easy and chearful.</P>
<P>The vote was then publicly read, and I stood up, and declared my readiness to comply with what was required. The worthy gentleman who was chosen to dispute with me, then rose up, and said these words, 'I am not prepared to dispute with <HI>Mr. Winchester,</HI> I have heard that he says, That it would take six weeks to canvass all the argu∣ments fairly on both sides; and I suppose he has been studying upon the subject for a week or more, and I have not studied it at all; and therefore I must beg to be excused.'</P>
<P>When I found that he, and all the rest wholly declined disputing with me, I begged liberty to speak for two hours upon my sentiments, and lay them fairly open, and the ground upon which I maintained them. But this was denied me; I then desired them to give me one hour for this purpose; but this was also refused. One of the Ministers got up, and said, That their business
<PB N="xxiii" REF="025050_0023_102D7595C205F1C0"/>
was not to debate with me, but to ask me, whe∣ther I believed the <HI>Restoration</HI> of bad men and angels, finally to a state of holiness and happiness, &amp;c.</P>
<P>But if they did not come to dispute with me, why was the vote passed by their party, as well as by my friends, that I should dispute with them? This speaks for itself. The ministers insisted upon putting the question to me, Do you believe the doctrine of the <HI>Universal Restoration?</HI> My friends objected to my answering the question, unless I might be allowed to vindicate my sentiments. But I said, That I did not fear any use that could be made of my words; that I had always freely con∣fessed what my thoughts were, when asked; and therefore I told them, that I did heartily believe the <HI>General Restoration,</HI> and was willing to defend it. The gentleman that was chosen to dispute with me, then asked me, whether I thought it strange, considering my change of sentiments, that there should be such a noise and uproar made upon the occasion? &amp;c. I told him, That I did not think it strange at all; and gave him a little history of the affair, and how the matter came abroad, through the treachery of some whom I had esteemed as my friends; that when I mentioned it to them I was not fully persuaded of it myself, and perhaps ne∣ver might have been, if I had not been opposed and threatened; that I never had intended to trou∣ble the people with my sentiments, but was willing to live and die with them, if they could bear with me; but that I could not use so much deceit, as to deny what I believed, when asked by any one; that I never had yet done so, and by the grace of God never would, let the consequences be what
<PB N="xxiv" REF="025050_0024_102D75C61AF94DD0"/>
they might. What I said was in the presence of all my accusers, and none of them could contra∣dict me, nor had aught to lay to my charge, ex∣cept in this matter of the Gospel of my Saviour. My discourse took such an effect upon him, that he then publicly declared, that my behaviour in the whole affair had been as became a <HI>man</HI> and a <HI>christian,</HI> and that no one could accuse me of any improper conduct. I stood sometime, and as none appeared to have any thing farther to say to me, I took my leave, and went out. He accompanied me to the door, and told me that he would write to me upon the subject; but whatever was the reason, he never did, nor have we spoken together since.</P>
<P>The Ministers then advised the people to get an∣other Minister; but my friends being numerous, insisted it should be fairly determined by the sub∣scribers at large; but this the other party would not agree to. Several very fair offers were made by my friends to them, but they refused them all; and finally, by force they kept us out of the house, and deprived us of our part of the property, which was at last confirmed to them by law, though I think unjustly, as we were the majority at first; but they took uncommon pains in carrying about a <HI>protest</HI> against me, to every member of the church, both in the city and in the country, and threaten∣ing all with excommunication who would not sign it; by which some were intimidated, and by these and other means they strengthened their party. But on the other hand, I took no pains, either to proselyte people to believe my sentiments or to make my party strong. But I believe near an hundred of the members suffered themselves to be excom∣municated
<PB N="xxv" REF="025050_0025_102D759819918840"/>
rather than to sign the <HI>protest</HI> against me, and the doctrine that I preached. When we were deprived of our house of worship, the <HI>trustees</HI> of the <HI>University</HI> gave us the liberty of their hall, where we quietly worshipped God for about four years, until we purchased a place for ourselves. But to return. After this meeting of the Minis∣ters, the whole affair was open, and I found my∣self obliged to vindicate the doctrine which they had condemned unheard, not only in private, but in the pulpit. Accordingly, on the 22d day of April, I preached a sermon on Gen. iii. 15. in which I openly asserted the doctrine of the <HI>Final</HI> and <HI>Universal Restoration</HI> of all fallen intelligences. This was published by particular desire, with a list of the plainest Scripture passages in favour of the doctrine; and a number of the most common and principal objections, fairly stated, and answered. This was my first appearance in the world as a <HI>prose</HI> writer, which was what I never expected to be, and probably should never have been but for this occasion; still less a writer of controversy, to which I had naturally a great aversion.</P>
<P>After I had preached this sermon, I had the <HI>Chevalier Ramsey's Philosophical Principles of Natu∣ral and Revealed Religion</HI> put into my hands; I read the same with great pleasure and advantage, and I must acknowledge it to be a work of great merit, and I have reason to bless God that ever I had opportunity of reading it. I can heartily re∣commend it, as one of the best works in our lan∣guage; and I must say, that in most things I fully agree with that very intelligent author. On the fourth day of January 1782, I preached the ser∣mon called, <HI>The Outcasts Comforted;</HI> from Isaiah
<PB N="xxvi" REF="025050_0026_102D75C8206C52D0"/>
lxvi. 5. to my friends who had been cast out, and excommunicated, for believing this glorious doc∣trine. This was soon after printed, and the next year it was republished in <HI>London,</HI> by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Richard Clark,</HI> and was the first of my works ever printed here.</P>
<P>I have thus given a brief, plain, and simple ac∣count of the means that have brought me to think and write in the manner that I have done, and which account may be considered as an historical sketch of nearly four years of my life.</P>
<P>I have every year since printed and published something, which I judged might be useful to my fellow-creatures; but as my works are in the hands of most of my friends, it is not necessary to give a particular account of any of them here, except this book of <HI>Dialogues on the Universal Restoration.</HI> I have had many discourses with various persons upon this subject, and many objections have been proposed to me, which I have endeavoured to an∣swer; and I can truly say, that these discourses, their questions, and my answers, their objections, and my solutions, form the bulk of these Dialogues. I have endeavoured to give all the possible force to their objections, and if any of them are weak, I can assure the Public, that I have not made them so (as some have insinuated) merely that I might be able to answer them, but the weakest of them have been proposed to me, and I have fairly set down the most powerful that I ever heard, gene∣rally in the very words in which they were ad∣dressed to me, whether in conversation, or by let∣ter; and I am willing if stronger objections can be made, to put them in the place of those which I have set down, or add them to the number; and I
<PB N="xxvii" REF="025050_0027_102D759A0430A5A8"/>
have in this new edition added a few, which I have heard since the work was first published, and es∣pecially one which was sent me by a venerable Minister, from <HI>America,</HI> and which I have largely answered.</P>
<P>I have the satisfaction of knowing not only that these Dialogues have been well received, but that they have been the means of bringing many persons to the belief of the truth of the <HI>Universal Restoration,</HI> and have strengthened and confirmed others, as will plainly appear from the following extracts of letters, which I have received from several Ministers in different parts of the kingdom, since their publication.</P>

<P>'I AM persuaded your knowledge of the world and its inhabitants, hath long since taught you to be familiar with the addresses of persons unknown to you; and I have formed that opinion of you, that your candour will admit, and your generous mind rejoice to hear, that a person, though unknown to you, is convinced that God hath gracious designs towards universal man. I am that person, Sir. For some time past I have entertained doubts with respect to the <HI>eter∣nity of hell torments.</HI> My doubts principally arose from the consideration of the vast disproportion be∣tween <HI>momentary crimes, committed in this short life,</HI> and the suffering <HI>infinitude</HI> of punishment: yet ma∣ny difficulties lay in my way that I did not know how to remove, and I continued thus embarrassed, until a short time since I had the happiness to meet with your <HI>Dialogues on the Universal Restoration,</HI>

<P>'My good friend, Mr. F—. shewed me your letter to him, by which I see your readiness to serve the cause of our great <HI>Head,</HI> Christ Jesus, and your willingness to visit the country, provided the way is open.

<P>'The subject of <HI>Universal Restitution</HI> has for ma∣ny years engaged my thoughts at times, and often appeared in an amiable light to my mind. It is a subject that redounds to the everlasting honour of God, and the everlasting felicity of the rational creature, who, when delivered from misery, shall be fully sensible of the obligations due to the De∣liverer, and consequently, shall naturally be en∣gaged in the great and delightful work of praising

<SALUTE>'REV. AND DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'I HOPE you will excuse the freedom I have taken in writing to you.</P>
<P>'I have for several years embraced your senti∣ments, and have often stood up in defence of them.</P>
<P>'I have frequently met with learned and can∣did men, who have given me much satisfaction in this important subject. When your Dialogues were published, I procured and read them with the greatest avidity. I found the subject handled much to my mind. The strongest objections rais∣ed
<PB N="xxx" REF="025050_0030_102D75CC1B4E5B40"/>
in all their weight and importance, and answered clearly and candidly. I read the book, over and over, with fresh pleasure and satisfaction. I studi∣ed the arguments, treasured them up in my me∣mory, and determined to become a defender of this part of truth. My heart burnt in love to God and mankind. I found exalted views of God, raised exalted strains of gratitude and praise. It was one of the strongest and most attracting views that ever I met with since I knew the Saviour's love. I soon entered the field, and was obliged to prove my armour against the strongest objec∣tions, backed with prejudices almost of an invin∣cible nature. When I was hard put to it, I had recourse to your Magazine, and from thence brought forth new pieces of artillery. You will easily suppose I had many trials from persons of different dispositions. By persuading several of my acquaintance, Ministers of the Gospel, to read over your book, I became an instrument of winning them over to the truth.</P>
<P>'One of my brethren in the ministry protested much against our notions, and declared he would never believe them. Knowing him to be a sensible man, and one who might be wrought upon by the force of truth properly stated, I used several argu∣ments to persuade him to read the book. At length he consented, and said, that he would do it to oblige me, but was determined not to believe it. I told him, it would satisfy me for him to give it a candid reading.</P>
<P>'When we met again, I began to enquire what he thought of the book. He paused a little, and then freely acknowledged the effect that it had had upon him—He frankly declared that his reso∣tion
<PB N="xxxi" REF="025050_0031_102D759D2AA03F28"/>
was just the same, as though he had resolved to look up to the Heavens when the sun shone at noon, and not to believe that it shone. I have secretly engaged several, and find when they are sensible, candid men, they fall in with your senti∣ments at once.</P>
<P>'I am acquainted with about half a score Mi∣nisters, who firmly believe and heartily embrace the doctrine; besides many private christians of different denominations. Most of us Ministers, who fall in with your sentiments, are a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>raid of confessing them publicly, for this reason, our peo∣ple would thrust us out of the synagogues, and we and our families might suffer thereby. For my own part, I am determined to stand by this truth, whether I can continue my place among the people where I am or not. Rather than give up this (through grace) I would give up life.</P>
<P>'I have so much zea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in my heart for the con∣firmation and establishment of this truth, that I would, were it in my power, gladly proselyte all men to embrace and enjoy the benefit of it.</P>
<P>'I hope you will muster up all your resolution, and stand forth boldly again in vindication of the cause of truth, and the most glorious and most ne∣glected part of that truth that all men ought to embrace. I fear lest the enemy shall cause a shout of triumph if you refuse again to engage, and do not come forth to the help of the Lord against the mighty. Please to inform me if you want any help where you are; I have some little for∣tune, and would engage in promoting the work of God, without being wholly dependent on any people.</P>

<SALUTE>'REV. AND DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'AN anxious desire of a more intimate acquaintance with you induces me to take this li∣berty of writing to you, hoping you will excuse my freedom; undoubtedly it will appear strange, that one you never saw nor heard of, should take such liberty. But as a foe to flattery, I just give you this short account of my first know∣ledge of you; which was only by the hearing of the ear.</P>
<P>'Something more than a year ago, I was told that there was a preacher just come to <HI>London, an American</HI> by birth, who had undertaken to preach an <HI>Universal Restoration</HI> to lost souls. As it was new to me, I was much surprised at this strange account, and I thought and said, (though with some degree of candour) that I looked upon it to be some one that could not dig, and was ashamed to beg, so to procure a living he had written this book. Here I rested for some time, thinking that much hurt would be done thereby; till the last time I saw Mr. <HI>Atkins,</HI> (who I understand is now in connection with you) he gave me some further
<PB N="xxxiii" REF="025050_0033_102D759FAE6F7380"/>
account of you and your doctrine. But I could not understand it from his account; yet he persisted I should believe it, if I was to read your <HI>Dialogues.</HI> I told him I would give them a fair reading, if I could see them. Still I entertained the same strange idea as before. The next account I had was from a young man of <HI>Berkhampstead,</HI> who came to see me, and in our discourse, I said, 'Some of your people have imbibed a new doctrine, I hear.' He said, 'Yes, and I verily believe it a truth.' I was now more surprised than before; but he said, if I was to see it he had no doubt but I should believe it also. 'Well,' said I 'if I could see the book I would lay prejudice aside, and give it a fair read∣ing, let it be what it may.' He very kindly told me, that as soon as he could get it home, (for he had lent it to a friend) he would send it to me. I thanked him, and promised to read it impartially, knowing that where party spirit reigns, blindness takes place.</P>
<P>'According to promise, he sent the book: and as I had done before, I now laid the matter before the Lord, with this petition, that he would not suffer me to be misled, or wander out of the way, as I knew that he knew my desire and intention. I was delivered from fear, and with candour and confidence I began to read my new book, and to my great astonishment, yet to my greater joy, I found what I had many times wished for secretly in my heart, namely, the possibility of a release for those poor sufferers, and not only so, but like∣wise the certainty of it; for as I read on, I could not but see, that it was the determination of JE∣HOVAH to make all men, as his creatures, happy in himself. O with what eyes did I now view the
<PB N="xxxiv" REF="025050_0034_102D75CFA4EF1FB8"/>
Deity, and what ideas did I entertain of him to what I had ever done before! (though I was on the general plan) O how my soul was filled with love! what gratitude did I feel to that God, who I now saw so loved all his creatures, as to give his only Son to die, with a pure design to glorify him∣self in the salvation of every soul! I now saw him a God of love indeed, but it is out of my power to tell fully the happy effect it had, and has now up∣on my mind; but it is something like what I expe∣rienced, when the Lord first set my soul at liberty; as I was then swallowed up, as in the vision of God. But the bigness of this sheet is not suffici∣ent to tell you all I could wish, but I trust I shall see you in person, as I should esteem it a privilege indeed to hear you preach, and to converse with you, and I fully intended coming to <HI>London</HI> about last May, on purpose, but as I had already a large family which, through the blessing of God, I main∣tain with my labour; finding it likely to increase, I could not well spare time to come, or I had been with you at that season, as I had nothing else in my way to hinder. Mr. <HI>John Holder,</HI> of <HI>Tring,</HI> an acquaintance of mine, has lent me a few little tracts of yours, which I am now reading with pleasure and profit, and he has kindly offer∣ed himself to accompany me at any time that I shall appoint to come and see you, but the same difficulty is now in the way as before. If ever Providence should open a way, I shall gladly em∣brace the opportunity. Though I have no doubt of the truth of the doctrine of the Restoration, as to myself, I have never spoke of it in public as yet, not knowing whether that may be the best way to make this glorious salvation known; but I
<PB N="xxxv" REF="025050_0035_102D75A143872AF0"/>
have spoke to several of the people in private, those whom I judged to have the best understanding, and the most candour; and most of these seem to be glad at the news, and my own wife in particu∣lar embraces it with all thankfulness, and joins with me in love to you and yours. (Though very ill at this time.) If it will not be attended with too much trouble, please to send me your <HI>Dia∣logues,</HI> bound, by the <HI>Aylesbury</HI> stage coach. I have given the coachman an order to pay the ex∣pence. As I stand like yourself (in this respect) unconnected with any party, (though I was with Mr. <HI>Wesley's</HI> people twelve years,) I am now free, I trust from bigotry and prejudice, open to con∣viction, and willing for instruction. A few lines from you will be gratefully acknowledged, and thankfully received, by your affectionate, though most unworthy, may I say, brother in Christ,</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE I.</HEAD>
<ITEM>OBJECTION.—That the words <HI>everlast∣ing, eternal, &amp;c.</HI> are applied to the punish∣ment of the wicked 2</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—These words are but seldom appli∣ed to the misery of the wicked; being con∣nected therewith only twice in the Old Testament, and but six times in the New; and are full as often connected with things and times that certainly have had, or will have an end, as they are with the misery of the wicked; which cannot therefore be certainly inferred from those w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ds being applied to it. The word <HI>forever,</HI> from which the word <HI>everlasting</HI> is derived, is frequently used in a limited sense; more than fifty passages of Scripture referred to where it is evidently used in that manner 4 5 9</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—But the words <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> are applied to the misery of the wicked; three instances of which are produced, which are all that can be found 10</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—This is a very strong phrase, and would be judged unanswerable, but for certain considerations. 10</ITEM>
<ITEM>1 If the phrase <HI>forever and ever</HI> intends any pe∣riod or periods longer than the word <HI>forever,</HI> then there must be a proportion, and consequently both must be limited 11</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="xxxviii" REF="025050_0038_102D75D3C5126E70"/>
2 This phrase as applied to future misery can∣not intend <HI>endless duration,</HI> since a time will come, when death, pain, and sor∣row shall be no more Page. 11</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It is more than probable that the lake of fire, in which the wicked will be pu∣nished with the second death, will be the earth dissolved by the general con∣flagration; and that the new earth will be formed out of the same mass, and consequently the lake of fire shall at last be no more Page. 12</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. There will come a total cessation of night Page. 12</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The same words are used full as often, if not oftener, for periods that must come to an end, as they are for the ages of future misery Page. 13</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Unless we allow this phrase, however strong, to intend ages and periods, we should set the Scripture at variance with itself, neither would it be possible to re∣concile several passages that are men∣tioned Page. 14</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—<HI>Forever</HI> when applied to things of this life and world may end, but being applied to things of another state <HI>must</HI> mean <HI>endless.</HI> Page. 15</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—The word <HI>forever</HI> applied to spiri∣tual things, and circumstances of ano∣ther state must not be always understood to mean <HI>endless</HI> Page. 15</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—But does not the phrase <HI>forever and ever,</HI> in the New Testament always in∣tend <HI>endless?</HI> Page. 16</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—It doth not. An undeniable in∣stance
<PB N="xxxix" REF="025050_0039_102D75A4CF7D8BB0"/>
brought in proof, to which several more might have been added Page. 16</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—But is not the Scripture chargea∣able with a design to mislead men in these words when applied to future misery, un∣less they intend <HI>endless duration?</HI> and does the limiting these words accuse Christ of duplicity and deceit in his threatenings? Page. 16</ITEM>
<ITEM>This answered, by shewing that the Jews might make the same objection against the whole system of Christianity, which puts an end to the dispensation which is talled <HI>everlasting</HI> Page. 17</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Hebrew word rendered <HI>everlasting,</HI> properly intends a <HI>hidden duration,</HI> or period, but not <HI>endless</HI> Page. 17</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—The same word <HI>everlasting</HI> or <HI>e∣ternal</HI> is in the very same verse applied both to the misery of the wicked and to the hap∣piness of the righteous Page. 19</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—The very same word is in other places applied to very different things, and whose natures and durations are entirely dissimilar Page. 20</ITEM>
<ITEM>The kingdom given by the Father to Christ shall end, and so also the kingdom giv∣en by Christ to his saints shall end; but this shall not diminish the glory of Christ, nor endanger the happiness of the saints. If the kingdom of Christ and his saints shall end, then certainly much more the kingdom of Satan Page. 21</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—But upon the supposition that the doctrine of <HI>endless damnation</HI> was true, in what manner might one expect it to be
<PB N="xl" REF="025050_0040_102D75D58D250550"/>
exprest in the Bible? Page. 22</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—If it was true, there could be no promises, intimations, or even distant hints to the contrary. And it is therefore shewn to be false by a number of positive proofs. If there were not promises and intimations of the <HI>General Restoration</HI> in the Scripture, the doctrine of <HI>endless damnation</HI> might be then concluded to be true, however dark; but the <HI>endless happiness</HI> of the righteous is set forth in much stronger language, and with more abundant force of expression. As for instance, St. John, who never applies the word <HI>everlasting</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> once in all his writings to the misery of the wicked, uses the word far oftener in his Gospel alone, as connected with the happiness of the righteous, than it is used in the whole Bible to express the misery of the wicked. And there are many strong and powerful expressions made use of to express the duration of happiness that are never applied to misery Page. 23 26 27 28</ITEM>
<ITEM>The <HI>endless</HI> happiness of the righteous stands upon such foundations that can never be overthrown or destroyed; such as their indissoluble union with the ori∣ginal source of life and happiness their being heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ, and the promise that they shall live because he lives; and his life is tru∣ly <HI>endless</HI> Page. 30 31 31</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—That since the wicked have cho∣sen evil and persevered in it through life, it is become a fixed habit in them, from
<PB N="xli" REF="025050_0041_102D75A70096C990"/>
which it would seem as impossible to re∣claim them, as to draw off the just from their attachment to God and goodness Page. 32</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—This reasoning founded upon the old pagan system of good and evil being two eternal co-existing principles Page. 33</ITEM>
<ITEM>All men are God's creatures, and therefore he will not contend for ever, nor be al∣ways wroth with the souls that he hath made Page. 34</ITEM>
<ITEM>Satan's kingdom and all evil shall be destroy∣ed, and therefore <HI>endless misery</HI> cannot have the same permanent foundation as <HI>endless happiness</HI> Page. 35</ITEM>
<ITEM>Two things diametrically opposite to each o∣ther cannot both exist together to all e∣ternity Page. 35</ITEM>
<ITEM>Inferences drawn from the foregoing in fa∣vour of the endless continuance of the life of the righteous, and which prove that the state of sin and misery shall end Page. 37</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objecion.—But does not the word <HI>all</HI> fre∣quently intend a part only? Page. 38</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answered.—By giving certain never-failing rules, whereby it may be known when the word <HI>all</HI> means strictly <HI>all,</HI> or the whole universally without any exception; con∣firmed by plain instances out of St. Paul's writings Page. 38</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—That perhaps by <HI>all</HI> things be∣ing put under Christ, nothing farther may be meant than their being brought into a state of forced subjection, or made subject to his controul Page. 40</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—They are now put under him in this
<PB N="xlii" REF="025050_0042_102D75D71DC55A68"/>
respect, but they are not yet put under him in the sense that they shall be, which implies a state of willing subjection Page. 40</ITEM>
<ITEM>The word <HI>many,</HI> frequently means <HI>all</HI> Page. 42</ITEM>
<ITEM>All things were <HI>created</HI> by Christ; all rebel∣lious beings shall be <HI>subdued</HI> by him, and all without exception shall be <HI>reconciled</HI> by him, and through him to God Page. 43</ITEM>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE I.</HEAD>
<ITEM>Objection.—Of the worm that dieth not, and the unquenchable fire, five times threaten∣ed by our Lord Jesus Christ in one passage Page. 46</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answered.—By reference to the words in the prophecy of Isaiah, to which our Lord pro∣bably alluded Page. 47</ITEM>
<ITEM>Passages from the prophets brought to shew a literal accomplishment of the original words Page. 48</ITEM>
<ITEM>The dreadful threatenings of future misery to the wicked, implied in those words of our Saviour. They shall be publicly punished and tormented in the lake of fire, which is the earth in its melted or dissolved state Page. 49</ITEM>
<ITEM>Nevertheless, there shall be a new creati∣on of the earth, and so the lake of fire shall cease Page. 50</ITEM>
<ITEM>Many instances of fires mentioned in Scrip∣ture, of which it was said, <HI>they shall not be quenched,</HI> which yet have ceased long ago Page. 52</ITEM>
<ITEM>And of those fires whose smoke is said to ascend up <HI>for ever</HI> Page. 55</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="xliii" REF="025050_0043_102D75A88F696F40"/>
Things contrary are often predicted of the same places and people, and must be understood as occurring at different times Page. 56</ITEM>
<ITEM>Our Lord's words of every one being <HI>salted with fire</HI> considered Page. 56</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—All the fires above-mentioned were on earth, and in time; but the fire of hell, being in eternity, can never go out, or cease to burn to all endless duration Page. 57</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—Those fires on earth that were <HI>never to be quenched</HI> did not continue to burn as long as the earth remained; and, there∣fore there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> no necessity of granting that the fire of hell shall burn to all eternity Punishments belong only to the ages of ages before Christ shall have delivered up the kingdom to the Father Page. 57 58</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall never be forgiven, &amp;c. Page. 58</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answered.—1. By shewing what this sin is, &amp;c. Page. 61</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. All that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ears the name of <HI>death</HI> shall be destroyed, and all sorrow, crying, and pain, shall cease and be no more Page. 64</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Where sin abounded grace shall much more abound Page. 66</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—The deplorable case of Esau Page. 68</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—He lost the birth-right, and the pe∣culiar privileges that belonged to the first-born, but yet he had a blessing from his father of a lower degree Page. 69</ITEM>
<ITEM>The great difference between them was more fulfilled in their posterity than in their own persons Page. 69</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="xliv" REF="025050_0044_102D75D8FA524C40"/>
Love and hatred are sometimes only com∣parative, and not positive terms, and on∣ly imply a preference of one to the other Page. 69</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—The great gulph between the re∣gion of happiness and misery is impassible Page. 69</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—Christ has passed it, when he went and preached to the spirits in prison, who were disobedient in the days of Noah Page. 70</ITEM>
<ITEM>This proves a state of conscious existence after the death of the body Page. 73</ITEM>
<ITEM>The rich man seems to have had compas∣sion towards his brethren Page. 79</ITEM>
<ITEM>The Scriptures constantly hold out punish∣ment in proportion to the sins committ∣ed in the present life Page. 80</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—The case of Judas, of whom Je∣sus said, 'Good were it for that man that he had never been born' Page. 81</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—1. This was a proverbial saying Page. 81</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Both Job and Jeremiah cursed the day of their birth, and wished they had ne∣ver been born, only on the account of wordly and temporal calamities, al∣though they had no fear of eternal dam∣nation, or any future punishment Page. 82</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Solomon declares an untimely birth to be far better than the longest and most prosperous life of one whose soul is not filled with good, and who hath no burial Page. 88</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. If Judas had died before he was born he would have escaped all earthly trou∣ble, and future misery, and would have been immediately happy Page. 89</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The nation of the Jews as much rejected and doomed to woe as Judas, and yet
<PB N="xlv" REF="025050_0045_102D75AA1E81CC98"/>
the final intention of God is to have mercy upon them all. Page. 90</ITEM>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE III.</HEAD>
<ITEM>Objection.—That the doctrine of the Resto∣ration tends to licentiousness, and is calcu∣lated to encourage the wicked to a continu∣ance in their evil ways, &amp;c. Page. 93</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answered.—First, by shewing the principles upon which the doctrine of the Restorati∣on is sounded Page. 95</ITEM>
<ITEM>1. God is the Creator of all Page. 95</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. His benevolence is universal Page. 96</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Christ died for all without exception, Page. 98</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—That Christ did not die for all, because he did not pray for all Page. 99</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—This objection is entirely ground∣less; for, though in one place he prays ex∣clusively for his apostles, yet a little after he prays for all that should believe on him, through their word; and, finally, that the world might come to believe and know that he was the true Messiah; which shall be the case when all believers shall be <HI>one,</HI> as the Father and Son are <HI>one</HI> Page. 100</ITEM>
<ITEM>The death of Christ for all men is so far from encouraging licentiousness, that it is the strongest of all motives to induce them to love and obey him Page. 102</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Another of the first principles on which the doctrine of the universal Restoration is founded, is the unchangeableness of God Page. 104</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="xlvi" REF="025050_0046_102D75DB0801A308"/>
5. The immutability of his counsels; con∣firmed by his oath Page. 105</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. That God hath given all things into the hands of Christ, and that nothing that is given to him shall be lost Page. 108</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. That the Scriptures must be fulfilled, and that none of them can be broken Page. 109</ITEM>
<ITEM>Secondly, It is proved that the doctrine of the Restoration cannot lead to licenti∣ousness, because it is perfectly consistent with experimental religion Page. 110</ITEM>
<ITEM>Queries asked upon this subject Page. 110</ITEM>
<ITEM>A little sketch of the author's experience Page. 112</ITEM>
<ITEM>Queries submitted to the consideration of all experienced Christians Page. 115</ITEM>
<ITEM>Inference deduced therefrom in favour of the doctrine of the Restoration Page. 116</ITEM>
<ITEM>Thirdly, It is proved, that the doctrine of the Restoration does not lead to licenti∣ousness, by its tendency to practical re∣ligion, several instances of which are mentioned, As, Page. 116</ITEM>
<ITEM>1. We are commanded to love all mankind, even our enemies Page. 116</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To do good to all Page. 117</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To forgive all that trespass against us Page. 118</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. To pray for all men, that they may be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth Page. 118</ITEM>
<ITEM>The belief of the Restoration so far from preventing us from these things, enables us to perform them with pleasure and consistency Page. 120</ITEM>
<ITEM>All shall be restored at last by the blood of Christ Page. 121</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="xlvii" REF="025050_0047_102D75AC9AC925B0"/>
Fourthly, It is proved, That the doctrine of the Restoration is according to god∣liness, because the belief of it tends to fill our hearts with all amiable tempers; as humility, meekness, universal benevo∣lence, &amp;c. and is calculated to destroy selfishness, envy, pride, malice, rage, &amp;c. Page. 121</ITEM>
<ITEM>Fifthly, The doctrine of the Restoration is vindicated from the charge of licentious∣ness, by an appeal to facts, especially by the amiable conduct of the <HI>Tunkers</HI> or German Baptists, in America, who universally hold these sentiments Page. 123</ITEM>
<ITEM>Reply to those who call this the doctrine which Satan taught Eve in the garden Page. 124</ITEM>
<ITEM>Dr. Whitby's grand objection, That the unbe∣liever shall not see life, answered Page. 128</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—The doctrine of endless punish∣ment said to be the strongest possible re∣straint upon sin, Page. 128</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answered.—1. By shewing that God doth not always lay the greatest possible restraint upon sin Page. 129</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The idea of limited punishment by ap∣pearing more just and reasonable to the mind, is more calculated to restrain sin and iniquity than the doctrine of endless misery Page. 130</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That, in fact, though the greater part have professed to believe endless damna∣nation, yet their belief appears not to have much restrained them from sin, Page. 131</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The great number of heathen people that die without ever hearing the Gospel, in∣fants, ideots, persons born deaf, &amp;c. ren∣der
<PB N="xlviii" REF="025050_0048_102D75DD02DF9880"/>
it probable that many are reclaimed in a future state Page. 132</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. That the intention of God is not so much to restrain sin, as to shew its enormity; and, finally, to destroy it out of the u∣niverse Page. 132</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. If the doctrine of the Restoration should be abused, that can be no argument a∣gainst it, as the Gospel itself has been perverted, yet is the greatest blessing to mankind Page. 132</ITEM>
<ITEM>Therefore it is evident that this glorious doctrine cannot justly be charged with the least tendency towards licentiousness Page. 133</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—It would not be prudent in God, even if he intended finally to restore the wicked, to let them know his gracious de∣signs before hand; it is time enough to let them know his gracious purposes towards them, when his former threatenings have failed of their effect, but not before Page. 133</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answered.—God has thought it the abound∣ing of his wisdom and prudence to make known to his saints this mystery of his will, even his purpose to rehead all things in Christ. This discovery is chiefly intend∣ed for the comfort and satisfaction of the good, and not for the encouragement of the bad Page. 134 135</ITEM>
<ITEM>God has frequently mixed promises of great mercies with threatenings of terrible judgments; yet his threatenings are not thereby weakened. Page. 136</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection. The doctrine of the Restoration seems not very plainly revealed in the Scrip∣ture,
<PB N="xlix" REF="025050_0049_102D7026F4362E30"/>
or it would not have been so long hidden from so many great and good men Page. 138</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—Things that have been plainly re∣vealed, have been still hidden from great and good men; as the death and resurrec∣tion of Christ Page. 138</ITEM>
<ITEM>As also the calling of the Gentiles Page. 141</ITEM>
<ITEM>Question. But how comes this man to know better than all the world? &amp;c. Page. 142</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answered. The charge denied. Many have known, believed, preached, and defended it Page. 142</ITEM>
<ITEM>The doctrine of endless misery is one prin∣cipal cause of the disagreement among Christians Page. 143</ITEM>

<LIST>
<HEAD>DIALOGUE IV.</HEAD>
<ITEM>Objection. Christ threatens the Jews that they should die in their sins, and that they could not come whither he went Page. 149</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer. Our Lord told his disciples them∣selves that whither he went they could not come, that is, then, as afterwards ex∣plained Page. 150</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. There are blessings promised in Scrip∣ture to all Israel, without exception. Page. 150</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Those that have been rejected and cast off shall at last return and be received Page. 151</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—That the blessings promised only respect those that shall be found alive on the earth at a certain time Page. 115</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—The inhabitants of Sodom, Sama∣ria and Jerusalem with their daughters, or
<PB N="l" REF="025050_0050_102D75DE9381D1F8"/>
neighbouring cities, shall all be restored, though destroyed long ago Page. 152</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. That all things are given to Christ with∣out exception; and that all that are giv∣en shall at last come to him in such a manner as not to be cast out. From which premises, the universal Restora∣ration is inferred, and proved to be cer∣tainly true Page. 153 154 155</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—God sware in his wrath that the Israelites should not enter into his rest Page. 159</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—The rest was the land of Canaan, being typical of the time of the Millenium, or Christ's reign on earth, and not of the ultimate state of happiness Page. 160</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—There are some of whom we read, That he that made them will not have mercy upon them, and he that form∣ed them will shew them no favour Page. 161</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—These words must necessarily be understood with some limitation, and refer to a particular season, when they shall have judgment without mercy, but final∣ly mercy shall rejoice against judgment Page. 161</ITEM>
<ITEM>This proved to be the true intent of the text, by a number of passages where absolute judgment without the least fa∣vour is threatened; but which threat∣enings are immediately succeeded by promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the richest blessings Page. 164</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection—That the wicked shall never see light Page. 164</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.—Not until subdued or overcome, as the words ought to be tendered Page. 164</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection. A great ransom cannot deliver
<PB N="li" REF="025050_0051_102D760E89A86980"/>
those who are taken away by the stroke of God Page. 165</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer. The great ransom cannot intend the blood of Christ, the power of which is unlimited, but gold and all the forces of strength, riches, wisdom, &amp;c. none of these can deliver their possessors from death Page. 165</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—Solomon says, That there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave; and that in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be Page. 167</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer.— The first part of this objection re∣spects only the state of the body in the grave, but cannot be brought to disprove the consciousness of the soul in the separate state, the resurrection of the body, a fu∣ture state of existence, or the final Restora∣tion Page. 168</ITEM>
<ITEM>The second part of this objection has not the least relation to the subject; but be∣longs to quite another matter. But if it related to the death of the body, (as it does not) it would be no real objection to the Restoration Page. 169 171</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection.—The living have hope, but the dead have none, their love, hatred, envy, &amp;c. are perished Page. 172</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer. This belongs to the present life, and to the state of the body in the grave; but forms no objection against the Restora∣tion Page. 172</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection. Our Saviour has said, The night cometh when no man can work Page. 173</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer. Our Lord was diligent in his work,
<PB N="lii" REF="025050_0052_102D75E0E89776D8"/>
and we ought to be so in our labours on earth, to which death will put an end. But this can form no objection to the final Res∣toration, as that is an event, which will be subsequent not only to death, but to the resurrection, and to a future state of punish∣ment according to the deeds done in the body Page. 173 174</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection. Many terrible passages of Scrip∣ture brought to prove the destruction and future misery of the wicked Page. 174</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer. The Scriptures are an unanswera∣ble objection to those who deny a future state of retribution, but not so to the scrip∣tural doctrine of the general Restoration Page. 177</ITEM>
<ITEM>Observations made upon those awful and striking passages Page. 177</ITEM>
<ITEM>The most terrible threatenings close with gracious promises Page. 178</ITEM>
<ITEM>This particularly instanced in the prophe∣cy of Ezekiel, where the threatenings denounced are numerous and very se∣vere, but commonly close with the gra∣cious declaration, And they shall know JEHOVAH; or some similar expression Page. 179</ITEM>
<ITEM>Question. But does not punishment harden and inflame, instead of softening and subduing the criminals? Page. 180</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer. Punishment to a certain degree pro∣duces the former effects, but in greater de∣grees and longer continued produces the latter Page. 180</ITEM>
<ITEM>This illustrated by a true story Page. 182</ITEM>
<ITEM>Different degrees of the same things pro∣duce quite contrary effects Page. 184</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="liii" REF="025050_0053_102D761056C6F690"/>
Objection. The deplorable estate of wicked men, their aversion to good, their love of vice, their hardness of heart, and opposi∣tion to every method taken to reclaim them, seems to render their Restoration an event hardly to be hoped for Page. 184</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer. However difficult it may be for our reason to admit the possibility of such monsters of iniquity being changed and re∣stored, yet nothing is too hard for God, and therefore faith may lay hold on his promises, which he hath graciously given us for our encouragement Page. 185</ITEM>
<ITEM>Examples are given us in Scripture of some of the most atrocious sinners being re∣claimed; we ourselves have been recon∣ciled; and therefore we should not des∣pair of the final recovery of all Page. 187</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection. There will come a time when the characters of all men will be so fixed and confirmed, that no change can afterwards take place upon them. He that is unjust, let him be unjust still, and he that is filthy let him be filthy still, &amp;c. Page. 187</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answered.—1. By considering the words as belonging to a certain period, and by the consideration of many other scriptural pas∣sages of a like import Page. 188</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. By comparison; as even the most holy creatures are unclean, compared with God: so those who remain filthy and unclean, during the present life, may be so esteemed hereafter, in comparison of those holy souls who having purged themselves from all uncleanness here,
<PB N="liv" REF="025050_0054_102D75E28234F100"/>
shall be reckoned as vessels of the high∣est honour in the house of God Page. 190</ITEM>
<ITEM>Objection. Those who add or diminish shall have the plagues added to them, or their part taken out of the book of life, &amp;c. Page. 192</ITEM>
<ITEM>Answer. This no objection to the general Restoration, but is a solemn warning for us to take heed that we do not fall under those dreadful punishments which await unbelievers and profane persons, nor lose those inestimable blessings which Christ has promised to the faithful, obedient, over∣comers, &amp;c. Page. 193</ITEM>
<ITEM>A sad instance of presumption mentioned Page. 196</ITEM>
<ITEM>The highest and greatest not secure, if they indulge themselves in sin Page. 196</ITEM>
<ITEM>The reflections cast upon the doctrine of the Restoration by its opponents shewn to be highly absu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Page. 198</ITEM>
<ITEM>The doctrine of annihilation considered Page. 199</ITEM>

<ITEM>6. Even allowing that sin is naturally infi∣nite, and deserves infinite punishment, that will not prove that any of the hu∣man race must be miserable without end; since Christ has made a full and sufficient reconciliation and propitiation for the sins of the whole world, and the grace of God must finally superabound and triumph over all sin, and consequent∣ly put an end to misery Page. 212</ITEM>

<HEAD>FAMILIAR DIALOGUES BETWEEN A MINISTER AND HIS FRIEND, CONCERNING <HI>THE DOCTRINE OF</HI> THE RESTORATON OF ALL THINGS.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="dialogue">
<HEAD>DIALOGUE I.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I HAVE taken the freedom to call upon you, to have a little discourse with you concerning the doctrine of <HI>the Restoration of all Things,</HI> which it is said you believe; and to pro∣pose some objections.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am happy to see you, and am wil∣ling to discourse, as well as I am able, upon any subject that may be agreeable; but I have always made it a rule never to press the belief of my sen∣timents upon my friends; and I can safely say, that, though such great pains have been taken by my adversaries to prejudice people against me, I have never gone about from house to house to propagate my opinions; and I make it an universal rule not
<PB N="2" REF="025050_0058_102D75E676EF6290"/>
to introduce the subject in conversation, unless de∣sired; but yet I never have refused to own my sen∣timents, when asked, respecting the matter; and am ready, in the fear of God, to answer any ob∣jections that can be made, to a doctrine which I believe is plainly revealed in the Scriptures of truth, and appears to me worthy of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall first of all bring to view that grand objection, which is formed from the word <HI>eternal</HI> or <HI>everlasting,</HI> being applied to a future state of punishment; as in the following passages: Isaiah xxxiii. 14. 'The sinners in Zion are afraid, fearfulness hath surprized the hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire? who among us shall dwell with <HI>everlasting</HI> burn∣ings?</P>
<P>Dan. xii. 2. 'And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to <HI>everlast∣ing</HI> life, and some to shame and <HI>everlasting</HI> con∣tempt.'</P>
<P>St. Matt. xviii. 8. 'Wherefore, if thine hand or thy foot offend thee (or cause thee to offend) cut them off, and cast them from thee; it is better for thee to enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands, or two feet, to be cast into <HI>everlasting</HI> fire.'</P>
<P>St. Matt. xxv. 41. 'Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye curs∣ed, into <HI>everlasting</HI> fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.' Verse 46, 'These shall go away into <HI>everlasting</HI> punishment: but the righteous in∣to life <HI>eternal,</HI> or <HI>everlasting,'</HI>—The same word in the original being used for both, though varied by the translators.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="025050_0059_102D761618C9DEF8"/>
St. Mark, iii. 29. 'But he that shall blas∣pheme against the Holy Ghost, hath never for∣giveness; but is in danger of <HI>eternal</HI> damna∣tion.'</P>
<P>2 Thes. i. 7, 8, 9. 'The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: who shall be punished with <HI>everlasting</HI> destruction, from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power.'</P>
<P>Jude, 6, 7. 'And the Angels which kept not their first estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reserved in <HI>everlasting</HI> chains under darkness, unto the judgment of the great day: Even as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over unto for∣nication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of <HI>eternal</HI> fire.'</P>
<P>These texts, together, form such an objection to the doctrine of the Restoration, that I can by no means believe it, unless this can be fairly answer∣ed, and proofs brought from the Scriptures to shew, that the words <HI>everlasting</HI> and <HI>eternal,</HI> (which are translations of the same word and synonimous) being connected with the punishment of the wicked, and their future misery, do not neces∣sarily imply the continuance of the same while God exists.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am glad that you have so fairly and fully stated the matter; and I highly commend your resolution, not to believe the <HI>universal doc∣trine,</HI> unless this can be answered fully, without any torturing or twisting the Scriptures; and if I
<PB N="4" REF="025050_0060_102D75E80CAA7E20"/>
am not able, with God's assistance, to remove this difficulty, I will publicly recant my senti∣ments.</P>
<P>But, before I come to give a direct answer, I would beg leave to remark how very seldom this word is used to express the duration of punishment. We should think, by some sermons we hear, that <HI>everlasting</HI> is applied to misery in every book of the New Testament, if not in every chapter. A friend of mine told me, that he was once preaching in Maryland, and after sermon a man came and asked him, of what denomination he was? To which he answered, A Baptist. I think, says the man, that you do not preach up so much <HI>everlasting damnation,</HI> as the Baptists and Methodists, among us, do. To which my friend replied, <HI>Everlasting damnation</HI> is found in the Scripture. True, answered the man; but some preachers give us more of it in one ser∣mon than is to be found in the whole Bible. The truth of this remark will appear, if we consider that St. Luke, never uses the word <HI>aionion,</HI> or <HI>everlast∣ing,</HI> as connected with the misery of the wicked, in his gospel; nor St. Mark but once, and then in a particular case only: In the gospel of St. John, it is not to be found at all, in that connection, nor in any of his epistles: In the account of the preaching of the apostles through the world, in the first age of Christianity, we do not find it men∣tioned, in that light, so much as once: No, not in all the sermons, and parts of sermons, which St. Luke has preserved in the Book of the Acts: though the doctrine of <HI>everlasting damnation</HI> is the substance of many modern discourses. St. Paul never mentions <HI>everlasting destraction</HI> but once, though his writings form such a considerable part
<PB N="5" REF="025050_0061_102D7617B319B5F8"/>
of the New Testament. Neither are such words found in the epistle of St. James, or in those of St. Peter; and but three times in the gospel of St. Matthew: And only twice in all the Old Testa∣ment. But was the word <HI>aionion</HI> applied to misery but once, in the whole Bible, it would deserve a serious consideration; and unless the force of it can be removed by the authority of Scripture, it must remain an unanswerable objection. But I shall proceed to answer it, by bringing an equal number of passages where the word <HI>everlasting</HI> is applied to <HI>things</HI> and <HI>times,</HI> that have had, or must have, an end. As in the following passages: Gen. xvii. 7, 8. 'And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their ge∣nerations, for an <HI>everlasting</HI> covenant; to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee. And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for an <HI>everlasting</HI> possession; and I will be their God.' Verse <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>3. 'He that is born in thy house, and bought with thy mo∣ney, must needs be circumcised: and my cove∣nant shall be in your flesh for an <HI>everlasting</HI> cove∣nant.'</P>
<P>Here note, that the land of Canaan is called an <HI>everlasting</HI> possession; and the covenant of cir∣cumcision in their flesh, an <HI>everlasting</HI> covenant, though it is certain that the land of Canaan, as well as the other parts of the earth must be dis∣solved or melted, in the general confl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gration; and <HI>circumcision</HI> is now declared null and void by the Holy Ghost; and the ceremony cannot endure to endless ages.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="025050_0062_102D75E9AE0DFE48"/>
Of the same kind are the following passages: Gen. xlviii. 3, 4. 'And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz, in the land of Canaan, and blessed me; and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and mul∣tiply thee, and I will make of thee a multi∣tude of people: and will give this land to thy seed after thee, for an <HI>everlasting</HI> possession.' And in the blessing of Joseph, he says, 'The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors, up to the utmost bound of the <HI>everlasting</HI> hills.' By which, I suppose, the hills of the land of Canaan were meant.</P>
<P>God saith to Moses, Exod. xl. 15. 'And thou shalt anoint them (Aaron's sons) as thou didst anoint their father, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for their anointing shall surely be an <HI>everlasting</HI> priesthood, throughout their generations.' Lev. xvi. 34. 'And this shall be an <HI>everlasting</HI> statute unto you, to make an atonement for the Children of Israel, for all their sins, once a year; and he did as JEHO∣VAH commanded Moses.'</P>
<P>The apostle declares, that these <HI>everlasting</HI> ordi∣nances were only <HI>till the time of reformation,</HI> Heb. ix. 10. And this <HI>everlasting</HI> priesthood of Aaron's sons has ceased long ago: 'For the priesthood being changed, (by Christ) there is, of neces∣sity a change also of the law: For he of whom these things are spoken, pertaineth to another tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar: For it is evident, that our Lord sprang out of Judah; of which tribe Moses spake no∣thing concerning priesthood. And it is yet far
<PB N="7" REF="025050_0063_102D7619AE859778"/>
more evident: For that, after the similitude of Melchisedec, there ariseth another priest, who is made not after the law of a carnal command∣ment, but after the power of an endless life: For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec: For there is verily a dis∣annulling of the commandment going before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.' Heb. vii. 12—18. The whole sum of the apostle's argument, in this epistle, tends to prove, that the <HI>everlasting</HI> ordinance is now no more; and the <HI>ever∣lasting</HI> priesthood of Aaron and his sons, is now abolished.</P>
<P>Another passage where the word <HI>everlasting</HI> is evidently used in a limited sense, is, Numb xxv. 11, 12, 13. where we read thus: 'Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath turned my wrath away from the Children of Is∣rael while he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the Children of Israel in my jealousy. Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace: And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the cove∣nant of an <HI>everlasting</HI> priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made an atonement for the Children of Israel.'</P>
<P>If the word <HI>everlasting</HI> intends <HI>endless duration,</HI> how should we be able to reconcile this promise with the total cessation of the Levitical priesthood? As for the family of Phinehas, with whom this covenant of an <HI>everlasting</HI> priesthood was made, it was entirely deprived of the benefit of the same, within the space of four hundred years: For when the sons of Eli transgressed the covenant, by pro∣faning it, God sent him word, that as they had
<PB N="8" REF="025050_0064_102D75EBAD748150"/>
broken it on their parts, it was entirely, and to all intents and purposes dissolved. Read 1 Sam. ii. from the beginning of the 12th verse to the end of the 17th, and from the 27th verse to the end of chapter: And also, chap. iii. 11, 12, 13, 14.</P>
<P>I will transcribe verse 30, of the second chapter, in proof of my point. 'Wherefore, JEHOVAH, God of Israel, saith, I said, indeed, that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me <HI>for ever:</HI> But now JEHOVAH saith, Be it far from me, for them that honour me, I will honour; and they that despise me, shall be light∣ly esteemed.' Hophni, and Phinehas, were soon after slain in one day; and Saul, the king of Israel, sent Doeg, the Edomite, who fell upon the priests, and slew fourscore and five persons, who wore a linen ephod, in one day. 'And Nob, the city of the priests, smote he with the edge of the sword; both men, and women, and children, and suck∣lings, and oxen, and asses, and sheep, with the edge of the sword.' 1 Sam. xxii. 19. The whole house of Phinehas seems to have been destroyed at this time, except Abiathar; and when Solomon came to the throne, he thrust him out from being priest, 'that he might fulfil the word of JEHO∣VAH, which he spake concerning the house of Eli, in Shiloh,' 1 Kings, ii. 27. From this time, the house of Ithamar had the priesthood.</P>
<P>It is so evident that the word which is translated <HI>everlasting,</HI> cannot in the nature of things, abso∣lutely signify, <HI>without end,</HI> that I should not think it worth while to quote any more passages in proof of its intending <HI>age,</HI> or <HI>ages,</HI> only, were it not con∣stantly used as a great objection against the uni¦versal Restora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion: I shall, therefore, instance two
<PB N="9" REF="025050_0065_102D761BB57F1180"/>
or three more in particular, in this place, and re∣fer to a great number of others, of the same kind; all tending to prove the same thing. Hab. iii. 6. 'The <HI>everlasting</HI> mountains were scattered, the <HI>perpetual</HI> hills did bow.' The gospel is called, the <HI>everlasting</HI> gospel,' Rev. xiv. 6. yet it must cease to be preached, when it shall be needed no longer. Jonah saith, 'The earth with her bars was about me, <HI>for ever:</HI> yet hast thou brought up my life from corruption, O JEHOVAH, my God.' Jonah, ii. 6. But it would be the highest absurdity upon the supposition that the word <HI>Legnolam,</HI> here rendered, <HI>for ever,</HI> properly signifies <HI>without end,</HI> for him to say, that his life was brought up from corruption; and, therefore, we know that he could not use it in that sense, be∣cause, on the third day, he was delivered from his dreadful prison. There is no doubt but the time that he was there, seemed an age, and, while he was thus shut up, there was no intermission to the darkness, and distress, that overwhelmed him; and, therefore he might say, with propriety, that the earth, with her bars, was about him, for ever,' (i. e. <HI>perpetually without cessation</HI>) during the period he remained in the fish's belly; which appeared to him, as a long age indeed. But, as it would be a work of much time and labour to mention all the passages where the word translated <HI>for ever,</HI> evidently intends only an age, or period, I shall just direct you to the following; which you may look over at your leisure.</P>
<P>Gen. xiii. 15. xliii. 9. xliv. 32.—Exod. xii. 14, 17, 24. xxi. 6. xxvii. 21. xxviii. 43. xxix. 9, 28. xxx. 21. xxxi. 16, 17. xxxii. 13.—Lev. iii. 17. vi. 13, 18, 20, 22. vii. 34, 36. x. 9, 15. xvi. 29,
<PB N="10" REF="025050_0066_102D75ED70907EC0"/>
31, xxiii. 14, 21, 31, 41. xxiv. 3. xxv. 30, 46.—Numb. x. 8. xv. 15. xviii. 8, 19. xix. 10.—Deut. iv. 40. xv. 17. xviii. 5. xxviii. 46.—Joshua iv. 7. xiv. 9.—1 Sam. ii. 30. iii. 13. xxvii. 12. xxviii. 2.—1 Kings, xii. 7.—2 Kings, v. 27.—2 Chron. x. 7.</P>
<P>Here are more than fifty passages, where the word rendered <HI>for ever</HI> intends only <HI>age,</HI> or <HI>ages;</HI> to which many more might be added.</P>
<P>Now, the rule for understanding words is this: What <HI>must</HI> be the meaning of the word, in <HI>many</HI> places, and what <HI>may</HI> be the meaning in <HI>all;</HI> is the true sense of the same.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Although the single word <HI>forever,</HI> in these passages, seems evidently to intend certain unknown, <HI>limited</HI> periods; yet, what can you do with those texts that say, the misery of the wicked shall endure <HI>for ever and ever?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, they are terrible threatnings; and, no doubt, will be fully executed.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But, do you imagine that such passages as the following can intend less than <HI>endless misery?</HI> Rev. xiv. 11. 'And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up, <HI>for ever and ever:</HI> and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.' Rev. xix. 3. 'And her smoke rose up <HI>for ever and ever.'</HI> Rev. xx. 10. 'And the devil, that deceived them, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are, and shall be tormented, day and night, <HI>for ever and ever.'</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I confess, you have proposed a diffi∣culty that I should judge to be unanswerable, were it not for the following considerations:
<PB N="11" REF="025050_0067_102D761D9B79C488"/>
<HI>1st,</HI> If <HI>for ever and ever</HI> is a longer time than <HI>for ever,</HI> which must be granted; then is there some proportion between them: Thus, if <HI>for ever</HI> intends an <HI>age, period,</HI> or sometimes <HI>ages; for ever and ever,</HI> may intend <HI>ages,</HI> an <HI>age</HI> of <HI>ages,</HI> or <HI>ages</HI> of <HI>ages:</HI> But any <HI>proportion</HI> at all between two periods, supposes both <HI>to have an end,</HI> or there could <HI>be no propor∣tion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> I find a time promised, when, 'there shall be no more death; neither sorrow nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain; for the for∣mer things are (or shall then be) passed away. And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all things, new. And he said unto me, (John) Write; for these words are true and faithful.' Rev. xxi. 4, 5.</P>
<P><HI>3dly,</HI> I think there is sufficient reason, from the words of St Peter, in his second epistle, third chap∣ter, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 verses, to conclude, that as the earth was once overflowed with water, and became truly a lake of water, wherein the world of ungodly men perished; so, by the general confla∣gration, the same shall become literally the lake of fire and brimstone, in which the wicked shall be punished after the day of judgment: But I also think, that the 13th verse of the same chapter, compared with Rev. xxi. 1. Isaiah lxv. 17. lxvi. 22. more than intimates, that the new heaven and earth shall be created out of the substance of the old, dissolved by the fire; that the <HI>new earth</HI> shall no more have a <HI>sea</HI> therein, seems to imply, that in its former state, it had a <HI>sea,</HI> or why this expression, 'And there was no <HI>more</HI> sea.'—Now, if this hy∣pothesis is right, the following will be the true state of the case; <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="025050_0068_102D75EF07843990"/>
The lake of fire is expressly declared to be 'the second death,' Rev. xx. 14. The earth, in its burnt, melted, and dissolved state, will be the ge∣neral lake of fire and brimstone; according to the verses above cited from St. Peter. There will be a new heaven and a new earth, created out of the substance of the old, in which there will be no more sea, either of water, or of liquid fire; conse∣quently, the lake of fire, or second death, (which are declared to be synonimous) must end; and, of course, the punishment of the second death must then cease.</P>
<P><HI>4thly,</HI> The <HI>smoke</HI> of their torment is to ascend up <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> and they are to be tormented day and night: But, as the smoke of the burning earth must cease, when its substance is entirely dissolved or melted, and all combustible bodies are con∣sumed; and as it is intimated in Job xxvi. 10. that day and night shall come to an end: and in Rev. xxi. 25. it is said of the New Jerusalem, 'And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day, for there shall be no night there.' For all these reasons, I cannot be altogether persuaded, that their being tormented <HI>day and night, for ever and ever,</HI> during which time the smoke of their tor∣ment shall constantly ascend, is quite equal to <HI>endless misery,</HI> especially as there shall come a time when <HI>death</HI> shall be no more, <HI>pain</HI> shall be no more, <HI>sorrow</HI> shall be no more, <HI>smoke</HI> shall probably ascend no more, and, peradventure, <HI>night</HI> shall be no more.</P>
<P><HI>5thly,</HI> But the great reason of all, why I do not conceive that <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> doth certainly in∣tend <HI>endless duration,</HI> is, because I find the words as often used for <HI>times</HI> and <HI>periods,</HI> that must have
<PB N="13" REF="025050_0069_102D761F2B1338C0"/>
an end, as you find them used for the misery of the wicked. You bring three passages, which are all that are to be found in the whole Bible, where they are used in that sense; I shall now invalidate those evidences for <HI>endless damnation,</HI> by bringing an equal number of texts, where you will allow the words are used in a limited sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible that you can find any such passages in the Bible? Pray shew them to me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Isa. xxx. 8. 'Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a book, that it may be for the time to come, <HI>for ever and ever.'</HI></P>
<P>See Jer. vii. 1—7. The 7th verse is, 'Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, <HI>for ever and ever.'</HI></P>
<P>Jer. xxv. 5. 'Turn ye again, now, every one from his evil way, and every one from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that JE∣HOVAH hath given unto you, and to your fa∣thers, <HI>for ever and ever.'</HI></P>
<P>These passages are as many, and as strongly ex∣pressed, as those which you brought to prove <HI>end∣less misery;</HI> and yet nothing can be more evident than that they cannot intend <HI>endless duration.</HI>— Here, these periods must be limited by the great conflagration; and thus (for ought that appears as yet) the misery of the wicked <HI>may</HI> be <HI>limited,</HI> not∣withstanding the use of those expressions, to set forth its dreadful continuance to unknown ages; at least, those words do not necessarily imply, that they shall never, as long as God lives, be delivered from their sins and consequent sufferings.</P>
<P>If we were always to read <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> ENDLESS, we should set the Scriptures at variance;
<PB N="14" REF="025050_0070_102D75F130271278"/>
and no criticism could ever reconcile them. Try, for instance, to reconcile Psalm cii. 25, 26, with Psalm cxlviii. 6. 'Of old hast thou laid the foun∣dation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou shalt endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change them, and they shall be changed.—He hath also esta∣blished them <HI>for ever and ever:</HI> he hath made a decree which shall not pass.'</P>
<P>Now, if the words <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> signify <HI>without end,</HI> then there is a contradiction that can∣not be reconciled; but only understand them <HI>ages of ages,</HI> (as, indeed, they ought to be rendered) and the whole difficulty vanishes at once.</P>
<P>Suppose a person should read Rev. xx. 11. and xxi. 1. 'And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was found no place for them. And I saw a new heaven, and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more sea;' And should then say, These visions cannot be true, because Salomon hath said, 'One generation passeth away, and another cometh, but the earth abideth <HI>for ever,'</HI> Eccles. i. 4. And God 'laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed, <HI>for ever,</HI> Psal. civ. 4. The world also is established that it cannot be moved,' Psal. xciii. 1. See also Psal. lxxviii. 69. and xcvi. 10. What would you think of such reasoning? Just so weak, must all the reasoning against the universal Restoration be, from the words <HI>for ever,</HI> and <HI>for ever</HI> and <HI>ever,</HI> being ap∣plied to states of future misery, if God has promis∣ed
<PB N="15" REF="025050_0071_102D762132A6D3D0"/>
to put an end to them all, by reconciling all things to himself, destroying in, and introducing a new creation, and a state of universal and per∣manent happiness: For, if such promises real∣ly exist, and their existence can be demonstrat∣ed, all reasoning against them must be vain and futile.</P>

<P>It is certain, that when the word <HI>for ever</HI> is applied to things of this life and world, it intends <HI>a period;</HI> but when applied to spiritual matters, and things of another world, it must be <HI>endless,</HI> according to my judgment; and I am apt to think, you will find it so too.</P>

<P>I am certain that you will soon be convinced to the contrary. The apostle, speaking of Christ, says, 'But this man, after he had of∣fered one sacrifice for sins, <HI>for ever</HI> sat down on the right hand of God; from henceforth, ex∣pecting till his enemies be made his footstool," Heb. x. 12, 13. You will please to notice, that Christ's sitting down in the heavens, on the right hand of God, is not a circumstance belonging to <HI>this world,</HI> or <HI>the things of time;</HI> and he is is to sit there <HI>for ever;</HI> and yet that period, which, ac∣cording to your hypothesis, must be <HI>endless,</HI> is ex∣pressly limited by the sacred writings: The hea∣vens have received him, 'until the times (seasons, or ages) of restitution of all things,' (that is, till the beginning, and not the ending of those times) which God hath spoken of by the mouth of all his holy prophets since world began,' Acts, iii. 21. And the whole New Testament teacheth us, to wait for the coming of Jesus, from heaven; (1 Thes. i. 10.) which would be highly absurd, upon the supposition, that he is <HI>always</HI> to abide
<PB N="16" REF="025050_0072_102D75F34D99D3A8"/>
there: Which yet he must, if the word <HI>for ever,</HI> as applied to things of <HI>another</HI> state, intends <HI>endless duration.</HI></P>

<P>I confess, I never observed this before: But, do you know of any passage in the New Testament, where the words, <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> certainly intend <HI>limited</HI> duration? For I observed, that all the instances you brought were from the Old Testament.</P>

<P>Yes: Heb. i. 8.

<P>But when Christ threatened sinners, with <HI>everlasting</HI> fire, <HI>everlasting</HI> punishment, and <HI>eternal</HI> damnation; did not his expressions natural∣ly convey the idea of <HI>endless misery?</HI> And may not the Son of God be accused of duplicity and deceit, if he did not mean to denounce <HI>punishment without end?</HI> And, therefore, if we believe his words to be true, as most certainly they are, we must reject the doctrine of the Restoration, which puts an end to a state, which is called <HI>everlasting,</HI> by the mouth of truth itself.—Are you able to answer this fairly?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>If I am not able to answer this objec∣tion, which you have stated in the strongest man∣ner, I assure you, I will confess myself in an error; and shall thank you, (as an instrument) for bring∣ing
<PB N="17" REF="025050_0073_102D762350E86A38"/>
me to know it. The same objection that you make against the Restoration, the Jews make against <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>his religion;</HI> for they argue thus: God is an unchangeable Being, and he declared, in the most solemn manner, that the ordinances of the Levitical dispensation should be <HI>everlasting,</HI> and the anointing of Aaron's sons should be an <HI>everlasting</HI> priesthood, throughout their generations; (See Exod. xl. 15. and Lev. xvi. 34.) and, therefore, we must reject the Messiah of the Christians, as an impostor; inasmuch, as he pretends to abolish those statutes, which God hath called <HI>everlasting,</HI> and to set himself up as a Priest, contrary to the express promise of the LORD, who cannot lye, nor repent, that Aaron and his sons should have an <HI>everlasting</HI> priesthood; and, therefore, if this is the true Messiah, God meant to deceive us, when he pro∣mised these <HI>everlasting</HI> blessings, and privileges, which, we must suppose were only <HI>for a time,</HI> if Christianity be true; therefore, we reject it, as being inconsistent with the promises of God.</P>
<P>It is evident, from this view of the matter, that the Jews reject Christ and his religion, upon as good ground, as you reject the universal Restora∣tion, and perhaps better; for you have nothing to plead against the Restoration, but some threaten∣ings of punishments, which are called <HI>everlasting,</HI> or <HI>eternal,</HI> in our translation; but they plead ex∣press promises of the <HI>everlasting</HI> continuance of their church-state and worship, in opposition to Christianity. But, if it be true, that both the He∣brew and Greek words, which our translators have rendered by the English word <HI>everlasting,</HI> do not intend <HI>endless duration,</HI> but, a <HI>hidden period,</HI> or <HI>periods;</HI> then the ground is changed at once, and
<PB N="18" REF="025050_0074_102D75F5478041F0"/>
the Jews have no right to object against Christiani∣ty, because God, promised a continuance of their temple worship, for a <HI>certain age, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, hidden period;</HI> nor the Christians to reject the universal Restora∣tion, because God hath threatened the rebellious with such dreadful punishments, which shall en∣dure through periods, expressed in the same terms. It is indeed confessed by some of the most learned Jews, that they have no word in their language, which absolutely signifies <HI>endless duration;</HI> and therefore, they can only argue the <HI>endless</HI> continu∣ance of any thing from its nature, and not merely from the words rendered <HI>for ever,</HI> or <HI>everlasting.</HI> And, if this is the truth of the case, (as who can deny it?) then, neither did JEHOVAH speak to de∣ceive the Children of Israel, when he promised them blessings of such long continuance, which have ended long ago, and which are never to be restored by virtue of that covenant which he made with their fathers, when he brought them out of Egypt: but by the new covenant, which he <HI>will</HI> make with them, when he shall return them to their own land; nor did the Son of God speak to deceive, when he threatened the wicked with those punishments, which shall not end <HI>till they have an∣swered the purposes for which it seems reasonable to believe they shall be inflicted;</HI> viz. to bring them down, and humble their proud and stubborn hearts; which shall be done, during the periods of his kingdom, before he shall have delivered it up to the Father, that God may be ALL IN ALL.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But if I should grant that the word <HI>aionion</HI> doth not even in the New Testament always signify <HI>endless duration,</HI> yet what would you gain by it, since it is plain that Christ hath set <HI>the happi∣ness
<PB N="19" REF="025050_0075_102D7624E3E525E0"/>
of the righteous,</HI> and <HI>the misery of the wicked,</HI> one against the other; and hath expressed the con∣tinuance of both, by the same word, <HI>aionion,</HI> in St. Matth. xxv. 46? Here, the punishment of the wicked, and the life of the righteous, are both declared to be <HI>aionion,</HI> or <HI>eternal,</HI> without distinc∣tion: Now, can you shew me any passage of Scripture, where the same word is applied to two different things, whose existence is not the same, or the time of their continuance not alike?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Fairly stated! And, if it be not as fairly answered, it shall be looked upon as an insu∣perable difficulty. But, happily, there is a pas∣sage, in Hab. iii. 6. where the same word is used for very different things; 'He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder the na∣tions; and the <HI>everlasting</HI> mountains were scat∣tered, the <HI>perpetual</HI> hills did bow: his ways are <HI>everlasting.</HI>' In our translation, the mountains, and the ways of God, are called <HI>everlasting,</HI> and the hills <HI>perpetual;</HI> but, in the original, the word <HI>gnad</HI> is applied to the mountains, and the word <HI>gnolam</HI> to the hills, and the ways of God. But whether we argue from the original, or from the translation, it makes no difference: The question is, Are the mountains, or the hills, <HI>eternal</HI> in the same sense in which the ways of God are? If so, the earth must have existed <HI>coeval</HI> with the ways of JEHOVAH, and the hills, and mountains, must never be removed, while his ways endure; and, as his ways can never be destroyed, the absolute eternity, not of the earth only, but of its present form, its mountains and hills, must be inferred: contrary to Isaiah xl. 4. xliv. 10—Ezek. xxxviii. 20.—2 Pet. iii. 7, 10, 11, 12.—Rev. xvi. 2c. xx.
<PB N="20" REF="025050_0076_102D75F6DB3604C8"/>
11.—Nay, even in this very text, the ways of God are spoken of as being of a 'different nature from the mountains, which were <HI>scattered,</HI> and the hills, which did <HI>bow.</HI></P>
<P>Thus, no solid argument can be drawn from the application of the same word to <HI>different</HI> things, to prove that they shall be equal in their continu∣ance, unless their nature be the same.</P>
<P>Thus, in the <HI>Greek</HI> New Testament, in Rom. xvi. 25. we read of the mystery which hath been kept secret, from <HI>Chronois aioniois,</HI> and, in the 26th verse, we find, that it is now made known by the commandment <HI>Tou aionion Theou.</HI> But must it be argued that because <HI>aioniois</HI> is applied to times, and <HI>aionion</HI> to God; therefore, <HI>times</HI> are as ancient as JEHOVAH, and must continue while he exists? The absurdity of this is too glaring. Our translators have rendered <HI>Chronois aioniois, 'since the word be∣gan,'</HI> instead 'of <HI>eternal times;</HI>' and have thereby shewn their judgement to be, that words cannot change the subjects to which they are applied, but the meaning of the words must be determined by the nature of the subjects.</P>
<P>In Jer. xxviii. 8. the word <HI>hegnolam</HI> is used in the Hebrew; but the translators did not think them∣selves obliged to render it <HI>'from everlasting,'</HI> or, <HI>from eternity;</HI>' as it would have been highly ab∣surd to have read, <HI>eternal</HI> prophets, or prophets which were from <HI>eternity;</HI> and have therefore ren∣dered it <HI>'of old,'</HI> though it is a stronger word than <HI>gnad,</HI> which they have translated <HI>'eternity,'</HI> in Isa. lvii. 15.</P>
<P>Many other instances of the like nature, might be brought; but these are fully sufficient to con∣vince any unprejudiced mind, that nothing can be
<PB N="21" REF="025050_0077_102D762675F9EAB8"/>
concluded in favour of <HI>endless punishment,</HI> from the word <HI>aionion</HI> being used to set forth the duration of it, as well as the duration of that life which our Saviour promises to the righteous.</P>
<P>But upon the supposition that our Saviour intends no more by the 'life eternal,' in the 46th verse of the xxvth of St. Matthew's gospel, than he doth in the 34th verse, by 'the kingdom prepared from the foundation of the world.' (which it would be hard to prove) then an answer might be given, without all this labour, in this manner; <HI>viz.</HI> that as the Father hath appointed Christ a kingdom, so he hath also appointed his saints a kingdom; (See St. Luke, xxii. 29, 30. Rev. ii. 26, 27. iii. 21.) but as the kingdom which the Father hath given to Christ, as Mediator, and as Judge, shall <HI>end,</HI> when he shall have subdued all things, and put down all rule, and authority, and power; (See 1. Cor. xv. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.) so, of consequence, that kingdom which is given to the saints or overcom∣ers, to subdue the nations, shall also <HI>end,</HI> when they shall be all subdued, and brought to submit. But as the glory of Christ shall not be <HI>lessened,</HI> but <HI>in∣creased,</HI> when God shall be ALL in ALL; so the happiness of the saints shall be so far from end∣ing, or being <HI>diminished,</HI> at that period, that it shall then arrive at the summit of perfection; but shall never close, nor decrease, while JEHOVAH endures.</P>
<P>Some time ago, a woman came to hear me, and I happened to mention in my sermon, that Christ's mediatorial kingdom was called <HI>everlasting,</HI> or <HI>ai∣onion;</HI> but that <HI>it must come to an end,</HI> when the kingdom should be delivered up to the Father, when he should have put down all rule, and all
<PB N="22" REF="025050_0078_102D75F8D246F098"/>
authority and power. After sermon, she was ask∣ed, how she liked? She answered, 'Not at all: he says, The <HI>everlasting</HI> kingdom of Christ shall end; and I never heard of such a thing before in all my life; and I am sure it must be contrary to Scripture.' The person who asked her, told her, that there was such a text somewhere, she could not tell exactly where to find it. But the woman persisted in it, that there was no such text; and went away, full of prejudice. Now, had this passage of Scripture been in the Book of the Revelations, it would not have been so much to be wondered at, that she had never heard of it; but when we consider, that this is express∣ed in that part of the 15th chapter of St. Paul's first epistle to the Corinthians, which is in the <HI>bu∣rial service</HI>—what shall we say?</P>
<P>Thus, if <HI>Christ's</HI> kingdom <HI>shall end,</HI> much more <HI>Satan's!</HI> If <HI>rewards,</HI> as such, shall cease; how much more <HI>punishments!</HI> If the <HI>everlasting</HI> king∣dom of the saints, which they shall possess <HI>for ever and ever,</HI> (See Dan. vii 18, 27.) shall end, or be swallowed up in that kingdom of boundless love, where God shall be ALL IN ALL; how much much more, shall all sin, pain, sorrow, and death, cease, and have no more a name in God's crea∣tion!</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But supposing the doctrine of <HI>endless misery</HI> to be a truth, how would you expect to find it expressed in the Bible?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I should have a right to expect, in the first place, that there would be no promises in the Scripture to the contrary; no such passages as these: 'For I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and
<PB N="23" REF="025050_0079_102D7628CCF9CAE8"/>
shall not return▪ that unto me every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall swear;' Isaiah xlv. 23. Mind well, EVERY TONGUE SHALL SWEAR. Swearing allegiance, as every civilian will tell you, implies <HI>pardon, reception,</HI> and <HI>protection,</HI> on the part of the king; and a hearty <HI>renouncing of rebellion, true subjection,</HI> and <HI>willing obedience,</HI> on the part of the rebels. Kings of the earth may be deceived, but God cannot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he will never accept of any feign∣ed subjection; and therefore, all that swear, shall swear in truth and righteousness; so shall rebellion cease, and disobedience be no more.</P>
<P>The apostle St. Paul, seems to quote this pas∣sage of Scripture with some variation, in his epis∣tle to the Philippians, chap. ii. 9, 10, 11; where, speaking of the sufferings of Christ, and the con∣sequences of the same, he says, 'Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a a name, which is above every name; that at (<HI>or</HI> in) the name of <HI>Jesus</HI> every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.' Now, this confession appears to me to imply <HI>a willing subjection to the authority of the Saviour,</HI> brought about by the operation of the blessed Spirit; for the same apostle saith, Wherefore, I give you to understand, that no man, speaking by the Spirit of God, calleth Je∣sus accursed; and no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost,' 1 Cor. xii. 3.</P>
<P>Then the argument, thrown into a syllogistical form, will run thus:</P>
<P>If every knee shall bow, of things in heaven,
<PB N="24" REF="025050_0080_102D75FB2AC57E50"/>
and thing in earth, and things under the earth; then shall all rebellion cease.</P>
<P>But the first is ture; therefore, also the last. If every tongue shall confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father; and no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost; then shall the Holy Ghost work effectually in every man. As the major is proved, by Phil. ii. 11. and the minor, by 1 Cor. xii. 3, the conclusion must be evident to a demonstra∣tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I acknowledge, that in the present state, no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost; but when they shall stand before his bar, they shall confess him Lord, to the glory of God the Father, <HI>by force.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>But St. Paul speaks generally, 'that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost:' He does not mention <HI>time</HI> or <HI>place,</HI> but represents the matter impossible; besides every expression here used, implies <HI>a willing,</HI> and not <HI>a forced subjection;</HI> as bowing <HI>in the name</HI> of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and confessing him to be <HI>Lord</HI> of all, to the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lory</HI> of <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Father.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But we are sometimes told, that God is as much glorified by the eternal damnation of some, as by the eternal salvation of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have, indeed, heard some assert the same: But as the glory of God is the ultimate end of all that he doth, we may properly ask, why he should take any pains to save mankind?</P>
<P>But, above all, there is one objection that may be brought against this idea, which is hard to an∣swer; and that is, God hath said, 'For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the
<PB N="25" REF="025050_0081_102D762A9E1F3E20"/>
Lord GOD. Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked; but that the wicked turn from his way, and live: turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways; for why will ye die, O House of Israel? Ezek. xviii. 23. xxxiii. 11. It is evident to me, that God must take pleasure in what glorifies his name; and as he hath sworn, that he takes no pleasure at all in the death of the wicked, it must be set down for a truth, that <HI>punishment,</HI> without hav∣ing the reformation and subjection of rebels for its end, is unworthy of the Being we adore; and even now, it is called, <HI>'his strange work,'</HI>and <HI>'his strange act.'</HI> But to proceed: If <HI>endless</HI> misery were a truth, I should not expect that the mystery of the will of God, which he hath made known unto his chosen, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself, would be, 'That, in the dispensation of the fulness of times, he might ga∣ther together in one, (<HI>or</HI> rehead) all things in Christ, both which are in heaven, and which are in earth,' Ephes. i. 9, 10. Far less should I expect to find, that 'It pleased the Father that in him should all fulness dwell; and having made peace by the blood of his cross, by him, to recon∣cile all things to himself; by him, I say, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven.' Col. i. 19, 20. And I am not able to imagine, how St. John's vision (Rev. v. 13.) could be just, if <HI>endless damnation</HI> is true, where he says, 'And every creature who is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I, saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb, for ever and ever.' In the nature of
<PB N="26" REF="025050_0082_102D75FCF36C17D0"/>
things, it appears impossible to me to believe these passages to be strictly and literally true, if <HI>endless misery</HI> be a truth: Therefore I say, that I should not expect any <HI>intimations,</HI> far less <HI>absolute promises,</HI> that God would destroy death, the works of the devil, and make all things new, with many others of the like nature.</P>
<P>We find it promised, that every knee shall bow: and lest some might say, that <HI>every</HI> knee, meant only <HI>some</HI> knees, it is explained by the inspired apostle, to mean <HI>all</HI> things in heaven, and in earth, and under the earth: and not only so, but every tongue shall <HI>swear,</HI> and <HI>confess</HI> that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father; which could not be, except all were reconciled to him, whether things in heaven, or things in earth: Wherefore, this is also promised; and, in consequence of their being subdued, humbled, made obedient, and reconciled, they shall be <HI>reheaded in Christ;</HI> never more to go astray, nor break that band of eternal union, which shall bind all together in one body, joined to one head; and all shall give never-ceasing praise to God and the Lamb, <HI>world without end.</HI></P>
<P>As endless damnation appears to me to be <HI>against the promises,</HI> I cannot hold it as an article of my faith; but were there no promises or intimations to the contrary in Scripture, I should not require it to be threatened in any stronger terms than it is; I should believe it as a truth, though I might not be able, at present, to see the propriety and equity thereof; I should never suffer my weak reason to gainsay Divine Revelation: But my difficulty arises from these express promises of God, which com∣pose so great a part of that book which is given us as a rule of faith and practice; and which promi∣ses
<PB N="27" REF="025050_0083_102D762C30D2FA48"/>
expressly assert a future state of things beyond sin, sorrow, pain, and death of every kind; when all things shall be made new; and death, the last enemy of God, Christ, and man, shall be destroy∣ed, swallowed up in victory; and sin, which is its sting, shall be no more in existence; and tears shall be all wiped away, from all faces.</P>
<P>But though I have acknowledged that I should not dare to dispute the doctrine of <HI>endless damnation,</HI> unless God had given <HI>intimations,</HI> and even <HI>promises,</HI> to the contrary; since I find several dreadful threat∣enings in Scripture, in which the word <HI>aionion,</HI> or <HI>everlasting,</HI> is joined with the punishment of the wicked; yet, a very little attention will shew us, that the felicity of the righteous is promised in much stronger language, than the misery of the wicked is threatened, in the Scriptures.</P>
<P>I remark, in the first place, that the word <HI>aio∣nion,</HI> rendered <HI>everlasting,</HI> or <HI>eternal</HI> is used much oftener in St. John's gospel alone, to express the continuance of the life, or well-being, of the righ∣teous, than it is used in the whole Bible, to ex∣press the misery of the wicked; and this remark is strengthened by observing, that he never once uses the word in his whole gospel, nor in his epis∣tles, to set froth the duration of punishment. See St. John, iii. 15, 16, 36. iv. 14. v. 24. vi. 27, 40, 47, 54, 68. x. 28. xii. 25, 50. xvii. ver. 2, 3. in all which passages, the word <HI>aionion</HI> is used to express the continuance of the well-being of the righteous.</P>
<P>But, not to insist on this: I observe, that there are many stronger expressions (even in our transla∣tion) to set forth the well-being of the righteous, than any that are used as connected with the misery
<PB N="28" REF="025050_0084_102D75FE8AE32F88"/>
of the wicked. I saiah, xlv. 17. we read, 'Isra∣el shall be saved in JEHOVAH, with an <HI>everlasting</HI> salvation; ye shall not be ashamed, not confound∣ed, <HI>world without end.</HI>' But where do we read, that the misery of the wicked shall have <HI>no end?</HI> The word <HI>endless,</HI> or <HI>world without end,</HI> is never once used by our translators, to express the eterni∣ty of punishment, in the whole Bible.</P>
<P>We read, in 1 Pet. i. 4. of 'an inheritance, <HI>in∣corruptible,</HI> and undefiled; and that <HI>fadeth not a∣way,</HI> reserved in heaven:' and in chap. v. 4. of 'a crown of glory, that <HI>fadeth not away:</HI>' and, Heb. xii. 28. of a 'kingdom, which cannot be moved:' And our blessed Saviour's words are re∣markably strong upon this subject, in many pla∣ces; as in St. Luke's gospel, chap. xx. 35, 36, where he says, 'But they who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the (first) resur∣rection from the dead, neither marry, nor are giv∣en in marriage: neither <HI>can they die any more:</HI> for they are equal unto the angels; and are the chil∣dren of God, being the children of the resurrec∣tion:' And in St. John, x. 27, 28, 29. we read thus: 'My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me: and I give unto them eternal life: and they shall <HI>never perish,</HI> neither shall any pluck them out of my hand. My Fa∣ther, who gave them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e, is greater than all; and none in able to pluck them out of My Father's hand.' In chap. xi. 25, 26. Christ says, 'I am the resurrection and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live; And whosoever liveth and believeth in me, shall <HI>never die.</HI>' And, in chap. vi. 50. he says, 'This is the bread that cometh down from heaven, that a man
<PB N="29" REF="025050_0085_102D762E4461A0B8"/>
may eat thereof, and <HI>not die.</HI>' And he expresses the perpetuity of heavenly bliss, and of our en∣joyment of the same, by advising us, saying, 'Lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven; where nei∣ther moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through nor steal. Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell that ye have, and give alms: provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not; where no thief approacheth, neither moth corrup∣teth,' St. Matth. vi. 20. and St. Luke, xii. 32, 33. This is that which St. Paul calleth 'a better and an enduring substance,' Heb. x. 34. But what shall I say of the apostle's words, 2 Cor. iv. 7? 'For our light affliction, which is but for a mo∣ment, worketh for us, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath hyperbolen eis hyperbolen aionion baros doxes katergazetai emin:</HI> a glory, ex∣ceeding <HI>aionion,</HI> or eternal, <HI>to an excess.</HI>' Here is an hyperbole upon an hyperbole; beyond eter∣nal; a far more exceeding eternal weight of glo∣ry.</P>
<P>But it is not so much by the different words made use of to denote the permanency of the feli∣city of the righteous, from those which are used to express the duration of the misery of the wick∣ed, that I judge of the <HI>continuance of the one</HI> be∣yond the other; so much as from the different sources from whence they flow, and of their dif∣ferent natures.</P>
<P>The happiness of those who are reconciled to God, arises from their union to Christ; in which if they continue grounded and settled during this present life, wherein they pass through so many sore trials, the union will become so permanent,
<PB N="30" REF="025050_0086_102D7600C6E4F038"/>
as that it will be impossible to dissolve it; and the very nature of things shews, that if we abide firm to the end, through all difficulties, and overcome all those things that would seek to separate us from Christ, when we come into that state where we shall meet with no more temptations, nor any thing that hath the least tendency to draw our minds from God, we must, of consequence, re∣main attached, or united, to him, while we have an existence. This doctrine was known to David; and, therefore, he said, 'While I live, will I praise JEHOVAH; I will sing praises unto my God, while I have any being,' Psal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> cxlvi. 2. civ. 33. It may be proved, that the union shall continue between Christ and his faithful ones after this life, and shall become indissoluble; and that neither 'tribulation, nor distress, nor persecution, nor fa∣mine, nor nakedness, nor peril, nor sword; neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate us (who abide in him) from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord?' See Rom. viii. 35—39. See also St. John, xv. 4, 5, 7, 9, 10. 1 John, ii, 24—28.</P>
<P>The never-ending continuance of the life, or state of well-being of the righteous, may be cer∣tainly inferred, with the greatest ease, from the continuance of the life of Christ; who is made an high-priest, 'not after the law of a carnal com∣mandment, but after the power of an endless life,' Heb. vii. 16. And he hath expressly declared, 'Because I live, ye shall live also,' St. John xiv. 19. Thus, as long as the cause remains, the ef∣fect must continue; but the cause, even the life
<PB N="31" REF="025050_0087_102D76304764E608"/>
of Christ, must undoubtedly continue to endless periods; therefore also, the effect, or the life of those who are joined to him in an indissoluble uni∣on, shall continue. The apostle Paul understood logic as well as any in our days: and he thus rea∣sons upon this glorious truth; 'The spirit itself beareth witness with our spirits, that we (who are led by the Spirit of God, and have received the spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba, Father) 'are the children of God: And if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ: if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together,' Rom, viii. 16, 17.</P>
<P>Now, as Christ, the principal heir, cannot be disinherited; so, neither can those who are joint heirs with him. The Holy Spirit is given us as the earnest of our inheritance, and to seal us to the day of redemption, 2 Cor. v. 5. Ephes. i. 13, 14, and iv. 30. Christ is the head, and the overcom∣ers through the blood of the Lamb, are the members of his body, and shall inherit all things; he will be their God, and they shall be his children: he is their life, and he 'will make them pillars in the temple of God, and they shall go no more out,' Rev. iii. 12. St. Paul says, 'When Christ, who is our life, shall appear, then shall ye also appear with him in glory,' Col. iii. 4. And St. John says, 'Behold what manner of love the Father hath be∣stowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know, that when he shall ap∣peap, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is,' 1 John iii. 1, 2. Thus, we are sure, from
<PB N="32" REF="025050_0088_102D7602DEDF88B0"/>
the Scriptures, and from the nature of things, that those who are drawn by the Father, united to the Son, sealed by the Holy Ghost, willingly choose the Lord for their portion, and constantly adhere to him to the end, shall never be separated from him in the future ages; for he himself saith, 'As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me,' St. John, vi. 57. And as Christ is the great attracting loadstone, that shall finally draw all things to him; it is evident, that he will preserve <HI>for ever,</HI> those whom he hath thoroughly drawn to himself, and who have adhered to him through the time of trial. Thus is the life eternal of the righteous, or their endless state of well-being, ex∣pressed in much stronger language than the misery of the wicked; and, moreover, has its foundation in the union between Christ and his church, and in the nature of things.</P>

<P>But if the Spirit of God dwelling in us, and thereby causing us to adhere to Christ, and to follow him through all trials, makes our union to him so perfect, that nothing shall be able to sepa∣rate us from him to all eternity; since we are con∣firmed in habits of goodness by free choice, and by oft repeated exercises; why, by the same rule, shall not the misery of the wicked be <HI>endless,</HI> see∣ing that they have chosen and adhered to evil through life, and by constant practice are con∣firmed therein? Evil is grown up to a body in them; and it appears to me as difficult to reform and bring them off from their vicious habits, as it would be to draw the saints in light from their adherence to virtue and goodness.</P>

<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your reasoning would be conclusive, upon the supposition that <HI>there are two eternal prin∣ciples,</HI> viz. <HI>good</HI> and <HI>evil;</HI> if it can be proved, that evil is coexistent with goodness, that it hath always been: then, the absolute eternity of sin and misery may be easily inferred. This is the true founda∣tion of <HI>endless misery,</HI> and it came from the Pagan theology: The Heathens believed in <HI>two eternal principles,</HI> ever warring against each other, and nei∣ther fully prevailing; that men had the liberty of enlisting under which they pleased; and that those who in life chose virtue, should enjoy endless feli∣city; while those who chose, and adhered to vice, should eternally remain under its dominion, and of consequence be always miserable. Thus, the in∣fernal deities being judged by the poor Pagans to be as eternal as the good gods, and more power∣ful; they sacrificed more to the evil principle than to the good, out of fear, and to appease the anger of those abhorred, malevolent agents; hence, the frequency of human sacrifices.</P>
<P>Now, when the Christian religion triumphed over Paganism in the Roman empire, many of the philosophers embraced and professed it, but withal, retained many of their Pagan notions; among which was the <HI>eternity</HI> of these two opposite princi∣ples: hence arose the ancient sect of the Manichees, who believed not only the eternal existence of two contrary eternal Gods, one good and the other evil; but also, that all visible things were created by the devil; and upon this principle, they might argue the universality of damnation, with as much ease and certainty, as we, upon the contrary, may argue the certainty of the universal Restoration, accord∣ing to that glorious promise of God, Isaiah, lvii. 16,
<PB N="34" REF="025050_0090_102D7604A616F230"/>
17, 18, 19, 'For I will not contend for ever, nei∣ther will I always be wroth: for the Spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made. For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote him: I hid me, and was wroth; and he went on frowardly, in the way of his heart. I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also, and restore comforts unto him, and to his mourners. I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace, to him that is far off, and to him that is near, saith JEHOVAH; and I will heal him.'</P>
<P>Those who venture to contradict their Maker, and say, that <HI>he will contend for ever, and be always wroth;</HI> ought to give as good a reason, at least, why he <HI>will,</HI> as he hath given why he <HI>will not;</HI> and, consequently, must prove him not to be the Father of all spirits, and the Creator of all souls: If, therefore, it can be demonstrated, that Satan is an eternal, self-existent, immutable, evil being, and that he hath created all, or a part of mankind, (as some asserted formerly, and as I myself have heard lately) or that he hath drawn some of God's creatures into such an union with himself, that they cannot be separated from him; and that he will maintain his crown, throne, and kingdom, in opposition to God, to all endless duration; then, and not till then, may the <HI>eternity</HI> of sin and misery be concluded, from the nature of things, with equal ease and certainty, as the perfection and happiness of the saints.</P>
<P>But, if the kingdom of evil, and all the works of sin, Satan, and darkness, shall be totally de∣stroyed by Christ, and all things shall be rehead∣ed in him, who is the head of all principality
<PB N="35" REF="025050_0091_102D76344373B678"/>
and power, as well as of every man: See Ephe∣sians, i. 10. Col. ii. 10. 1 Cor. xi. 3. If every kn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e shall bow, and tongue shall swear, and all things, whether in heaven or in earth, or under the earth, shall confess that he is Lord; and all things, whether in heaven or in earth, shall be reconciled to him: See Isaiah, xlv. 23. Phil. ii. 10. Col. i. 20. And all kingdoms (not excepting that of the prince of the power of the air) shall be broken and destroyed by the kingdom of Christ, which shall itself be yielded up into the kingdom of boundless love, where <HI>judgment</HI> shall be no more: What shall we say of that doctrine, that teaches us the <HI>endless duration of evil?</HI> So far is the <HI>endless sin</HI> and misery of the wicked from being inferred from the <HI>endless</HI> holiness and felicity of the righte∣ous, in the kingdom of the Father, that every proof and demonstration of the latter, concludes equally against the former.</P>
<P>One of the first arguments that ever began to take hold of my mind, and to bring me to think seriously of the system of the Restoration, was, what I read in a little book upon the subject call∣ed, <HI>The Everlasting Gospel,</HI> &amp;c. and is there thus expressed.</P>
<P>'It is as impossible that there should be two end∣less contrary things, as that there should be two real contrary deities, a good God and a bad one, or two sorts of contrary creatures, both of truly divine original, some being made good by God, and others bad. For an absolute and merely infi∣nite duration, which has ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> beginning nor end, is according to the confession of all divines, yea or every reasonable man, a property peculiar to the uncreated Being only. But such an infi∣nite
<PB N="36" REF="025050_0092_102D760641C811E8"/>
duration, which, although it has a beginning, yet shall have no end, can only be the property of those creatures, that are of divine original. For as these, according to the language of the scripture, are of divine origin, and therefore are rooted in God, or in his almighty creating power, which has no beginning, they can also be everlasting, their ex∣istence o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> duration can also be without end in God. But whatsoever has not its eternal root in God, or in his eternal creating power, but is sprung up in the creature in this world, by its voluntary turning away from God, and against his holy will, and consequently is an abomination and dis∣pleasure to the Most High, and is only suffered by him, such as sin, and the punishment depending thereon, these things cannot possibly be of an ab∣solute endless existence and duration, or remain so long as GOD shall exist; but must of necessity once cease and be annihilated. For as God is a Be∣ing to those creatures which he created good, and which exist through his will, wherein they may subsist and be preserved without end; so he is on the contrary, to iniquity and sin, (which against his will, is sprung up in and sticks to the crea∣tures) a consuming <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire, whereby all sin and per∣verseness in the creatures must be at last consumed, annihilated, and separated from them in the highest degree, in order to restore them to their primitive purity; in the same manner as the fire does not consume and destroy the gold, but only the dross, and that which is impure.'</P>
<P>We will now state some of the arguments in fa∣vour of the <HI>endless</HI> continuance of the happiness of the saints, in the kingdom of their Father; and
<PB N="37" REF="025050_0093_102D76366BBF14D8"/>
those which prove that the state of misery shall come to an end</P>
<P>Christ hath promised, that the happiness of the saints shall have no end; because <HI>his life</HI> shall have no end, and he is <HI>their life.</HI></P>
<P>The misery of the wicked shall end, because the kingdom of evil shall end.</P>
<P>The power of God stands engaged to preserve and keep those who commit themselves to him; and thus their union with him shall always con∣tinue.</P>
<P>The same is engaged to destroy that covenant with death, and that agreement with hell, where∣by sinners are held in subjection to Satan, and thus to take the prey from the mighty, and the captives from the terrible.</P>
<P>The subjects of Christ are his natural subjects; he is their rightful sovereign: but Satan's subjects are slaves, led captive by him at his will; he is an usurper, and all that are in bondage to him belong to Christ, who will finally draw them all to him∣self.</P>
<P>Those that are in bliss shall be eternally attract∣ed by him, and shall always choose that which is good; but when evil is broken, its influence shall no more prevail over those that are captivated by it; and they shall feel the consequences of sin in such a manner as to loathe it; and they shall heartily return, and swear allegiance to their right∣ful King.</P>
<P>There shall be no influence to draw the saints in bliss from Christ, and thereby dissolve his king∣dom; but all the influence of God and goodness, shall tend to dissolve the kingdom of darkness, and
<PB N="38" REF="025050_0094_102D760897B3F670"/>
to put an end to the thraldom and misery of its un∣happy slaves.</P>
<P>Thus, I might go on with a long train of argu∣ments upon this subject; but these may suffice.</P>

<P>Your arguments would seem very conclusive, for the entire subjection of all things, if you could prove that the word ALL, intends literally and mathematically, <HI>the whole,</HI> without <HI>exception;</HI> but this, I doubt, will be dif∣ficult for you to do, as you must know, that it is very frequently used in common language for <HI>a part,</HI> and sometimes for <HI>only a small part of man∣kind.</HI></P>

<P>I acknowledge, this is the case in common conversation, and in such parts of the sa∣cred history where we are in no danger of being misled by it, being well informed by the context, or some other passages, or from the nature, or from the circumstances of the facts, that we must take it in a limited sense; but I do not recollect any passage, <HI>where any point of doctrine</HI> is spoken of, in which the word ALL is used in that <HI>uncertain</HI> and <HI>undeterminate</HI> manner: and it is necessary that it should not be used in that way, <HI>in matters of im∣portance;</HI> because we might be led into confusion and great uncertainty thereby; not knowing whether to understand it <HI>universally,</HI> or <HI>partially.</HI> Wherefore, I lay down this plain rule; <HI>viz.</HI> When the word ALL is used in any passage of Scripture, and we are not necessarily obliged, either by the context or some other text, or the nature and cir∣cumstances of the case, to understand it <HI>partially;</HI> and especially, where any important point of doc∣trine is spoken of we are always to understand it <HI>universally, without exception.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can you prove from the writings of the apostles, that they used the word ALL in this large and universal sense?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, my friend, very easily, and in the most unexceptionable manner, Hear what the au∣thor of the Epistle to the Hebrews says upon this matter: 'Thou hast put ALL <HI>things</HI> in subjection under his feet: for in that he put ALL in subjection under him; he left <HI>nothing that is not put under him,</HI>' Heb. ii. 8.</P>
<P>It is evident, that the apostle's reasoning would be very inaccurate, if not entirely false, upon the supposition that ALL <HI>things</HI> did not intend ALL, in the largest sense: for how would this conclusion naturally and necessarily follow, 'For in that he put ALL in subjection under him, he left <HI>nothing</HI> not put under him;' unless it be premised, that ALL is used in the <HI>universal</HI> sense of the word?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But hath not the same apostle made an exception, when he uses the word ALL, in some other of his writings?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, truly; but it is such an excep∣tion as justifies this sense of the word, more than a thousand arguments: 'For he hath put ALL <HI>things</HI> under his feet; but when he saith, ALL <HI>things</HI> are put under him, it is manifest, that <HI>he is excepted which did put</HI> ALL <HI>things under him.</HI>' 1 Cor. xv. 27. Here God the Father being alone excepted, proves all other beings to be included in the words ALL <HI>things;</HI> and that in so convincing a manner, that I am astonished that I did not perceive it long before I did.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is true, that nothing can be plainer, than that ALL <HI>things,</HI> in these places, must mean ALL beings, except God; but then, perhaps, St.
<PB N="40" REF="025050_0096_102D760A6351DEC0"/>
Paul only meant, that they should be subject <HI>to his controul,</HI> and not brought <HI>willingly to obey:</HI> If you can prove this point as clearly as you have the other, and from the same authority, it will seem to put the matter with me beyond dispute.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is very easily done; for it is uni∣versally acknowledged by all Christians, that all things are now, and have ever been subject to his controul; for when he was upon earth, in his low∣est state of humiliation, even the unclean spirits, the most rebellious of beings, obeyed his word; which made those who saw his miracles cry, with amazement, 'What thing is this? what new doc∣trine is this? for with authority commandeth he even the unclean spirits, and they obey him,' St. Mark, i. 27. The devils obeyed him universally, in whatever he commanded them; and could not enter into the swine without his permission; and how disagreeable soever his words were to them, they were <HI>forced</HI> to comply, without daring to complain; yea, they frequently seemed like hum∣ble suppliants; and once we read, they went so far as to adjure our blessed Lord not to torment them: See St. Mark, v. 7. The winds, waves, fishes, all obey him; all diseases, and even death itself, heard his voice, and departed at his bidding; and to his disciples he said, All power is given unto me, in heaven and in earth,' Matth. xxviii. 18. and certainly now, he is at 'the right hand of God, angels, and authorities, and powers, are made subject unto him,' 1 Pet. iii. 22. God hath exalted him far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named; not only in this <HI>age,</HI> (for so I render the word <HI>aio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI>) but also in that which is to come; and
<PB N="41" REF="025050_0097_102D7639CC766248"/>
put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church," Ephes. i. 21, 22. But, as though the apostle had known that the sense would be disputed, he hath said, 'But now we see <HI>not yet all things put under him,</HI>' Heb. ii. 8. All things were subject to his controul, <HI>even on earth;</HI> and they cannot be less so, now he is exalted to heaven, to the glory which he had with the Father before the world was; and yet, many years after his ascension, the apostle says, 'But now we see not <HI>yet</HI> all things put under him;' by which he must certainly mean their being <HI>wil∣lingly subject</HI> unto him; for, in all other senses, all things are <HI>now</HI> put under him, in the most un∣limited manner, as we have seen already. But the apostle goes on to tell how far the important work is accomplished, and that a sure foundation is laid for its entire completion; saying, 'But we see Je∣sus, who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour, that he, by the grace of God, should taste death for ALL;' (for so the word <HI>pantos</HI> ought to be rendered.) There was anciently a manuscript in use, in which the words were <HI>choris Theou</HI> in∣stead of <HI>chariti Theou,</HI> that is, <HI>for all,</HI> EXCEPT GOD. And there is little doubt of its being the true sense; because St. Paul makes the same exception, with respect to those who are put under Christ, as we have before noted, 1 Cor. xv. 27.</P>
<P>Then the apostle adds, 'For it became him, for whom are <HI>all things,</HI> and by whom are <HI>all things,</HI> in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through suffer∣ings,' Heb. ii. 9, 10.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="025050_0098_102D760C287EA748"/>
Instead of the word <HI>all</HI> intending only <HI>a part,</HI> we find, in several places, that the word <HI>many</HI> intends <HI>all,</HI> as in Rom. v. 15, 16, 19. 'For if through the offence of one, <HI>many</HI> be dead; much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, which is by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto <HI>many.</HI> The free gift is of <HI>many</HI> offences unto justification. For, as by one man's disobedience <HI>many</HI> were made sinners; so, by the obedience of one, shall <HI>many</HI> be made righteous.' Isaiah liii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 12. 'By his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify <HI>many</HI> (or <HI>the</HI> many) for he shall bear their iniquities. And he bare the sins of <HI>many</HI> and made inter∣cession for the transgressors.' These <HI>many</HI> are call∣ed <HI>all,</HI> in the 6th verse: <HI>All</HI> we, like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way: and JEHOVAH hath laid on him he iniquity of us <HI>all.</HI>'</P>
<P>But, to return to our subject: St. Paul assures us, that though <HI>all things,</HI> without exception, are put under him, in <HI>one</HI> sense; yet in <HI>another,</HI> he says,' But now we see not yet <HI>all things</HI> put under him.' But he leaves us not in the dark about the matter; but speaks of that effectual 'working, whereby he is able even to subdue <HI>all things</HI> unto himself,' Phil. iii. 21. And when <HI>all things</HI> shall be <HI>subdued</HI> unto himself, then shall the Son also himself be subject unto him that put <HI>all things</HI> un∣der him, that God may be ALL IN ALL,' 1 Cor. xv. 28. Here we plainly find, a very necessary distinc∣tion between all things being <HI>put under him;</HI> and all things being <HI>subdued unto him,</HI> the former is al∣ready done, in the fullest manner; and the latter <HI>shall</HI> be as perfectly and as fully accomplished, in due time: 'Because the creation itself shall be de∣livered
<PB N="43" REF="025050_0099_102D763BDDFE3130"/>
from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God. For we know, that the whole creation groaneth and tra∣vaileth in pain together, until now,' Rom. vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i. 21, 22.</P>
<P>Though what hath already been spoken, may seem more than enough to prove the point respect∣ing the word <HI>all;</HI> yet there is one passage more, full to the purpose, that I would not omit; it be∣ing, of itself, fully sufficient to settle the dispute for ever:— The apostle, speaking of Christ, saith, 'Who is the image of the invisible God, the first-born of <HI>every creature:</HI> for by him were <HI>all things</HI> created that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers; <HI>all things</HI> were created by him, and for him: and he is before <HI>all things,</HI> and by him <HI>all things</HI> consist.

<P>I hope that I am not so attached to my own opinions as to be unwilling to hear and consi∣der what may be advanced against them; but the doctrine of <HI>endless damnation</HI> has been so generally considered as a most important article of faith by all denominations, that I can by no means think of giving it up, unless you are able to establish the contrary system upon the most solid ground, and answer all the scriptural objections fairly, that have been, or that can be brought against it; for I must have all my doubts solved, before I can think of believing such a strange doctrine as this appears to me.</P>

<HEAD>DIALOGUE II.</HEAD>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>GOOD day to you, sir, I was just passing by, and if you have a little time to spare, I should be happy to have some far∣ther discourse with you, respecting your senti∣ments; for although I cannot fall in with your views, yet I am convinced, that your mind is up∣right in the matter, and that you do not disagree with your brethren for the sake of differing, but for what you believe to be truth.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have this to say, (and I can with truth declare it) that I never should have dissented from my brethren, had they only given me the li∣berty of enjoying that natural right of freely thinking for myself in matters of religion. I sin∣cerely wish to live and die in unity with all that love God and keep his commandments; and I should never have troubled the world with my sen∣timents, had not great pains been taken to repre∣sent me as a heretic, and my sentiments dangerous to mankind: This was done to prevent people from hearing what I had to say in other matters. I was therefore, in a sort, compelled to sit down and answer all the objections that were brought against the truth I believed; which answers, drawn (as I trust) fairly from the Scriptures, have satis∣fied
<PB N="46" REF="025050_0102_102D7661A96EB080"/>
many who have read what I then wrote upon the subject.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never saw your answers to objections in print: but in our last conversation, you gave such answers to many questions, as seemed to con∣vince me that much more might be said in favour of the general Restoration than I formerly imagined: But I have a number of objections remaining, which appear to me unanswerable; and which I beg leave to state you in the plainest manner.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do, my dear friend; you will give me pleasure by being free and open upon this subject; propose all your objections, in the strongest man∣ner possible, and I will give you such answers as have satisfied me in the matter; and I beg leave to assure you, that no light, trifling, or forced answer, far less a manifest evasion, would satisfy my mind upon this awful and interesting subject; and if what I believe is not capable of a scriptural defence, I shall endeavour to quit the ground as speedily as possible.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>The words of our Saviour, recorded by St. Mark, chap. ix. 43—49, form a very serious, and to me an unanswerable objection against the universal Restoration.</P>
<P>'And if thy hand offend thee (<HI>or</HI> cause thee to offend) cut it off: it is better for thee to enter in∣to life maimed, than having two hands, to go into hell; into the fire that never shall be quenched (<HI>or</HI> that is unquenchable): where their worm di∣eth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thy foot offend thee, (<HI>or</HI> cause thee to offend) cut it off: it is better for thee to enter halt into life, than having two feet, to be cast into hell, into the fire that never shall be quenched (<HI>or</HI> that is unquench∣able):
<PB N="47" REF="025050_0103_102D7036A2DC7FE0"/>
where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. And if thine eye offend thee, (<HI>or</HI> cause thee to offend) pluck it out: it is better for thee to enter into kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire: where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. For every one shall be salted with fire, and every sacrifice shall be salted with salt.'</P>
<P>Here our Lord repeats five times, that 'the fire is not, or never shall be quenched, or is unquench∣able;' words of nearly similar meaning: Three times he speaks of hell, as a <HI>place</HI> where 'their worm dieth not:' and, to shew the perpetuity of the sufferings of the miserable, he says, 'For eve∣ry one shall be salted with fire;' <HI>i. e.</HI> preserved by the fire, as salt preserves meat. These are the ob∣jections from this passage, briefly stated: Are you able to answer them fairly, without any evasion, from the authority of Scripture?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is certainly a most terrible pas∣sage, and deserves to be considered particularly.</P>
<P>There is no doubt but Jesus Christ had his eye upon that passage in Isaiah, lxvi. 24.—'And they shall go forth, and look upon the car<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ases of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an abhorring unto all flesh.'</P>
<P>It will be of use to us to understand when this prophecy shall be fulfilled: It shall be when the
Children of Israel shall return, and be settled in their own land; and their enemies shall come against them, and shall be destroyed, and their carcases shall fall upon the mountains of Israel, 
<PB N="48" REF="025050_0104_102D76633A10F5B0"/>
and shall be a prey to the fowls of heaven, and their flesh shall be devoured by worms, which shall not die, till they have eaten and entirely destroyed their bodies.</P>
<P>'Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou and all thy bands, and the people that is with thee; I will give thee to the ravenous birds of eve∣ry sort, and to the beasts of the field, to be de∣voured. Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it, saith Adona<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> JEHOVAH. And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses of the passengers; and there shall they bury Gog, and all his multitude: and they shall call it, The Valley of Hammon-Gog. And seven months shall the House of Israel be burying of them, that they may cleanse the land.' (See Ezek. xxxix. 4, 5, 11, 12.) 'And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all the nations which came against Jerusalem, shall even go up, from year to year, to worship the King, JEHOVAH, of Hosts, and to keep the feast of tabernacles.' Zech. xiv. 16. 'And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one sab∣bath to another, shall all flesh come to worship be∣fore me, saith JEHOVAH.' Isaiah, lxvi. 21. And they that shall come up to Jerusalem, to worship the Lord, during the time that these bodies shall lie in the open field, shall go forth, and behold them in a state of putrefaction, a prey to worms; and all the nations of the earth shall see God's judgments executed upon those who dare to rebel against: him, by making war against the Lamb, and against his army. Rev. xvii. 14. xix. 19.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="025050_0105_102D7038766F5168"/>
It is also intimated by Ezekiel, that a fire shall be kindled, to burn their weapons of war, &amp;c. which shall last for some time. Hear his words: 'And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the hand-staves and the spears; and they shall burn them with fire seven years: so that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons with fire.' See Ezek. xxxix. 9, 10.</P>
<P>Thus have I endeavoured to give the plain sense of the text to which our Lord alluded; and I have not the smallest doubt of its being hereafter literally fulfilled.</P>
<P>I will now endeavour to give what appears to me the meaning of the text before us:—Chri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> threatened that those who would not deny them∣selves, and cut off those things that led them into sin, should hereafter suffer infinitely greater incon∣veniencies, by being cast into hell fire. And, Oh! who can conceive how dreadful a portion is threat∣ened to some transgressors! that they 'shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out without mixture, into the cup of his indigna∣tion; and shall be tormented with fire and brim∣stone, in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up ages of ages; and they have no rest, day nor night.' Rev. xiv. 10, 11.</P>
<P>Thus, as the enemies of God, who shall be de∣stroyed near Jerusalem, shall have their carcases exposed, full of worms, and be an abhorring unto
<PB N="50" REF="025050_0106_102D766574B721E8"/>
all that behold them; so those who are cast into the burning lake, shall be publicly exposed to shame, and shall suffer openly for their crimes; and the smoke of their torment shall ascend up <HI>continually,</HI> during those ages that the lake of fire, or the second death, shall continue.</P>
<P>But when I consider that this terraqueous globe itself is probably to become the lake of fire, when the elements shall melt with fervent heat; and yet after that dreadful scene is past, the earth itself shall be renewed, and become the habitation of righteousness; I can hardly have any doubts, but all the rational part of the creation, 'shall be de∣livered from the bondage of corruption, into the glorious liberty of the children of God.' See Rom. viii. 19, 20, 21, 22.</P>
<P>Thus, if the lake of fire, or second death itself, shall be destroyed, shall cease, and be no more; there is an <HI>end</HI> to <HI>tormenting pain;</HI> though, perhaps, such <HI>inward reflections,</HI> shall continue for some time longer, (if not to eternity) which, though they shall tend exceedingly to increase the love of God in the souls thus delivered, shall fill them with shame, similar, or perhaps more pungent than we feel here on earth, when we are melted under a deep sense of our manifold transgressions, and of the pardon∣ing love of God at the same time.—This seems to me to be the meaning of such passages as these:</P>
<P>'O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the wind. As the fire burneth the wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; so persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy name, O JEHOVAH. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever;
<PB N="51" REF="025050_0107_102D703A26EF73F8"/>
yea, let them be put to shame, and perish: That —(our translators have added the word <HI>men,</HI> but the sense determines that the addition should be)— '<HI>they</HI> may know that thou whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth,' Psal. lxxxiii. 13—18.</P>
<P>'The wise shall inherit glory, but shame shall be the promotion of fools,' Prov. iii. 35.</P>
<P>'They shall be great<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, ashamed, for they shall not prosper; their everlasting confusion shall ne∣ver be forgotten,' Jer. xx. 11. xxxiii. 40.</P>
<P>'They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they shall go to confusion together, that are makers of idols, ' Isa. xlv. 16. 'And all are incensed against him, (JEHOVAH) shall be a∣shamed, ' verse 24.</P>
<P>'For thus saith Adonai JEHOVAH; I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast de∣spised the oath in breaking the covenant. Never∣theless, I will remember my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant. Then thou shalt remem∣ber thy ways, and be ashamed, when thou shalt receive thy sisters, thine elder and thy younger (<HI>viz.</HI> Samaria and Sodom); and I will give them unto thee for daughters, but not by thy covenant. And I will establish my covenant with thee, and thou shalt know that I am JEHOVAH: That thou mayest remember, and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more, because of thy shame, when I am pacified towards thee, for all that thou hast done, saith Adonai JEHOVAH,' Ezek. xvi. 59—63.</P>
<P>'Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall loathe yourselves in your own sight, for your ini∣quities,
<PB N="52" REF="025050_0108_102D766743228550"/>
and for your abominations. Not for your sakes do I this, saith Adonai JEHOVAH, be it known unto you; be ashamed and confounded, O house of Israel," Ezek. xxxvi. 31, 32.</P>
<P>But the lake of fire shall go out, when all the purposes for which it shall be kindled are accom∣plished; and if so, then it follows of course, that intelligences shall be no longer tormented therein.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But when God says, that a fire shall not be quenched, does it not necessarily imply, that it shall never cease burning?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>By no means: for we read in several places of Scripture of fires that have ceased, ages ago, that were spoken of in as strong terms as are used by Christ, respecting the fire of hell.</P>
<P>As for instance: In Lev. vi. 13. we read, 'The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar: it shall <HI>never</HI> go out.' This is a much stronger expression than if it had been said, 'It shall not be quench∣ed;' for it is said, <HI>'It shall never go out:'</HI> But surely, it must be used with some limitation; for for we know that it hath ceased, ages ago: And we read, that Daniel prophesied of the Messiah, that he should 'cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease,' Dan. ix. 27; but it would certainly have been a weak argument against Daniel's prophecy, that as Moses had said, The fire should never go out upon the altar, therefore the Messiah could never cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease; but it would be just as good an argument against Da∣niel's prophecy, as the words of Christ are against Isaiah's: 'For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth; for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of
<PB N="53" REF="025050_0109_102D703BFA24B848"/>
my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. Surely shall say, In JEHOVAH have I righteousness and strength; to him shall come; and all that are incensed against him shall be a∣shamed,' Isa. lvii. 16. xlv. 23, 24.</P>
<P>In Jer. xvii. 27. we read: 'But if you will not hearken unto me, &amp;c. then will I kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and <HI>it shall not be quenched.</HI>' See also chap. iv. 4, xxi. 12. Amos v. 6. 2 Kings xxii. 17.</P>
<P>Similar threatnings we find positively pronoun∣ced by Ezekiel, at the command of God: 'More∣over the word of JEHOVAH came unto me saying, Son of man, set thy face towards the south, and drop thy words towards the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field, and say to the forest of the south, Hear the word of JEHOVAH; Thus saith Adonai JEHOVAH, Behold I will kin∣dle a fire in thee, and it shall devour every green tree in thee, and every dry tree: the flaming flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from the south to the north, shall be burnt therein; and all flesh shall see that I JEHOVAH have kindled it; <HI>it shall not be quenched.</HI>' Ezek. xx. 45, 46, 47, 48. See also Jer. vii. 20.</P>
<P>Now these threatnings were surely executed; for the people did not hearken to God: he did certainly kindle a fire, and it burnt, and was not quenched, but consumed Jerusalem and all her palaces; and the beautiful forests that were so much esteemed, shared the same fate: But what person will argue, that the whole city and country must be now in flames; and must have been con∣suming,
<PB N="54" REF="025050_0110_102D76695EFAE498"/>
from the days of Jeremiah and Ezekiel, because of these expressions, 'The flaming flame shall not be quenched,' &amp;c. since we know that Jerusalem, and the country round about, have been since inhabited, and will be again, in a more glorious manner than ever?</P>
<P>Neither will it help the matter to say, that we must understand the fire <HI>figuratively,</HI> for the anger of God, &amp;c. for he declares by Zechariah, after the seventy years captivity, that he was 'returned to Jerusalem <HI>with mercies.</HI>' See Zech. i. 16. And though the present desolation of that land is com∣pared to the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboim, Deut. xxix. 23—28. And Ezekiel not only speaks of it as desolate and waste, but as having been always so; though we know it was formerly filled with inhabitants: (See Ezek. xxxvi. 34, 35, xxxviii. 8.) Yet all the prophets speak of a time to come, when it shall be much more flourishing than ever it hath been; and Isaiah says, 'Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hat∣ed, so that no man went through thee; I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of many generations. Thou shalt no more be termed For∣saken; neither shall thy land be termed Desolate; but thou shalt be called Hephzibah <HI>(my delight is in her)</HI> and thy land Beulah <HI>(married);</HI> for JE∣HOVAH delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married,' Isaiah lx. 15. lxii 4.</P>
<P>Thus we may see, by these and many other pas∣sages, that predictions apparently directly contrary one to the other, may be all fulfilled upon the same land, people and persons; only allowing a proper time to each, without which we can never make sense of many prophecies.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="025050_0111_102D703E55DB5258"/>
Isaiah, speaking of the land of Bozrah, says, 'And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the dust thereof into brimstone: and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. It shall not be quenched, night nor day; the smoke thereof shall go up for ever: from generation to generati∣on it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it, for ever and ever. But the cormorant and the bit∣tern shall possess it; the owl also, and the raven, shall dwell in it:' (birds that cannot live in fire, pitch, and brimstone, any better than men.) 'And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation for dragons, and a court for owls. The wild beasts of the desart shall also meet with the wild beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow: the screech-owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a place of rest. There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay and hatch, and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be gathered, every one with his mate. Seek ye out of the book of JEHOVAH, and read: no one of these shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath commanded, and his Spirit it hath gathered them. And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from generation to generation shall they dwell therein,' Isaiah xxxiv. 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17.</P>
<P>Now, in this passage, there are such things spo∣ken of as are impossible to be fulfilled at once, without as great a miracle as was wrought for the three children in the furnace; and which there is no reason to expect will be wrought in favour of
<PB N="56" REF="025050_0112_102D766B69ECA698"/>
cormorants, bitterns, owls, ravens, dragons, satyrs, wild beasts, thorns, nettles, and brambles. In the 10th verse we read of a period, called <HI>for ever,</HI> wherein this land is to be on fire and is not to be quenched, night nor day: and the smoke of it is to ascend up <HI>for ever;</HI> but in the 17th verse, it is said, that the before-mentioned birds and beasts shall possess it <HI>for ever,</HI> even from generation to generation shall they dwell therein. But one of these periods must end, before the other can be∣gin; the fire must cease to burn, and the smoke to ascend, before beasts can take up their constant dwelling there, and birds can lay and hatch, and gather their young ones under their shadow, and enjoy the society of their mates. And thus the whole prophecy may be fulfilled; not in the <HI>same,</HI> but in <HI>different</HI> periods: And thus also, may all the threatenings, and all the promises, in the sacred book, be accomplished; not at once, but each in their season.</P>
<P>It appears evident, that our Lord, by alluding to a fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e that shall burn on earth, and to worms that shall devour the flesh of the slain, could not mean to prove the torments of men to be abso∣lutely <HI>endless;</HI> at least, the expressions of the <HI>worm</HI> that <HI>dieth not,</HI> and <HI>the fire</HI> that <HI>is not quenched,</HI> do not <HI>necessarily</HI> imply it; which has been sufficient∣ly proved, by the passages where the same or si∣milar expressions are used, where yet the subject cannot intend <HI>endless</HI> duration; and this is all that can be necessary to prove at present.</P>
<P>As to the expression of being <HI>salted with fire,</HI> as <HI>every sacrifice was salted with salt;</HI> I am not so clear, what might have been our Saviour's intent in this expression; but I think, in the first place, he in∣tended
<PB N="57" REF="025050_0113_102D70401B586D60"/>
to teach us, that they should not be <HI>annihi∣lated</HI> by the fire, but <HI>preserved</HI> therein, to be tor∣mented day and night, in the presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb, during the ages of ages. I would also propose, whether our Lord did not mean to intimate, that even the fire itself shall be of use under his direction, to humble, subdue, and penetrate the stubborn and disobedient rebels, that shall be cast into it. <HI>Fire,</HI> as well as <HI>salt,</HI> is a great purifier; and preserves and cleanses those things which are able to endure it; and is the great agent by which all metals are separated from their dross, and prepared for the use for which they were designed. Under the law, all unclean things, that could endure the fire, were ordered to be cast into it, in order to their cleansing.</P>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>What you have said concerning the fires that are represented as unquenchable, in several passages of Scripture, is worthy of attention; but you should consider, that these fires were all on earth, and in time, and therefore must have an end, or cease to burn; but the fire of hell is in eternity, and therefore must last as long as eternity shall endure. Pray, what can yon say to this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Had those <HI>unquenchable</HI> fires never gone out while earth endured, or while time lasted, there might have been some force in this argument; but since the continuance of the fire does not depend upon the <HI>season</HI> in which it is kindled, but upon the <HI>combustibles</HI> that feed and support it, this can be no objection: Therefore, since those unquenchable fires that have been mentioned, were kindled on earth, and yet not burn while earth lasted, but have gone out long ago; there is no necessity of
<PB N="58" REF="025050_0114_102D766CF94C9058"/>
granting, (even though we should admit your pre∣mises of the fire of hell being kindled in eternity) that the unquenchable fire of the burning lake <HI>must</HI> unavoidably burn to <HI>all eternity,</HI> merely be∣cause it is supposed to belong to that state: But if punishments only belong to those ages of ages be∣fore Christ shall resign the kingdom to the Father, and the lake of fire shall be this terraqueous globe, dissolved, or melted, with fervent heat; then the ground is changed, and the whole objection va∣nishes of course.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>As you have come over this objection better than I expected you could, I shall leave it for the present, and consider more fully, when I am by myself, what you have said upon this sub∣ject; and shall now propose the greatest objection that can be brought against the Restoration of all men, from the Scriptures; and which, if you can fairly answer, I shall be almost persuaded to believe with you: but I am persuaded that you will be hard put to it.</P>
</SP>

<P>Produce your cause, and bring forth your strong reasons, that we may hear them; and if I am silenced, I will not be ashamed to acknow∣ledge it with all my heart.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I shall bring my objection from the Scrip∣tures, and state it with the utmost precision that I am able:—It is the sin against the holy Ghost, of which our Saviour speaks in the most awful man∣ner; saying, 'Wherefore I say unto you, all man∣ner of sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men. And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall (<HI>or</HI> may) be forgiven him; but whosoever speaketh
<PB N="59" REF="025050_0115_102D763DABBD6B10"/>
against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world (<HI>or</HI> age) neither in the world (<HI>or</HI> age) to come. Verily, I say unto you, all sins shall (<HI>or</HI> may) be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: but he that shall blaspheme against the Holy Ghost, hath never forgiveness, (<HI>or</HI> hath not forgiveness to the age) but is in danger of eternal damnation,' St. Matth. xii. 31, 32. St. Mark, iii. 28, 29. This is such a matter of importance, that three of the evangelists notice it. St. Luke hath it thus: 'And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall (<HI>or</HI> may) be forgi∣ven him; but unto him that blasphemeth against the Holy Ghost, it shall not be forgiven,' St. Luke, xii. 10. St. Matthew saith, this sin shall not be forgiven in this world, nor in that to come; St. Mark, that such an one hath never forgiveness, but is in danger of eternal damnation; and St. Luke positively saith, it shall not be forgiven: And, to confirm the matter still more, if possible, St. Paul saith, 'For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted the hea∣venly gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come; if they shall fall away, (<HI>or,</HI> and have fallen away) to re∣new them again to repentance; seeing they cruci∣fy to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame. For if we sin wilfully, after that we have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adver∣saries. He that despised Moses's law, died with∣out

mercy, by the mouth of two or three witnes∣ses: Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanc∣tified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite un∣to the Spirit of grace?' Heb. vi. 4, 5, 6, x. 26, 27, 28, 29. And the same Apostle directs us, saying; 'Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who for one morsel of meat sold his birthright. For ye know how that after∣wards, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of re∣pentance, though he sought it with tears.' Heb. xii. 15, 16, 17.</P>
<P>And St. John, the beloved disciple, says; 'If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he shall pray for it,' 1 John v. 16.</P>
<P>Now here is a sin for which there is no forgive∣ness, neither in this world (<HI>or</HI> age) or in that to come; which shall not be forgiven at all; he that committeth it hath never forgiveness, is in danger of eternal damnation; he cannot be renewed again to repentance, because he hath crucified Christ to himself afresh, and hath put him to an open shame: having sinned wilfully and maliciously, after receiv∣ing the knowledge of the truth, to such no more sacrifice for sins remaineth; judgment and fiery in∣dignation are his certain portion, he is an adver∣sary,
<PB N="61" REF="025050_0117_102D763FA8F0F118"/>
and must be devoured: a sorer punishment than death without mercy awaits him, of which he is worthy, for that he hath trodden under foot the Son of God, the only Saviour, and hath count∣ed the precious blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, and which alone is able to cleanse from sin, an unholy thing; and hath done despite to the Spirit of grace, which is only able to renew the heart, and therefore the case of such must be desperate; for if such an one, like Esau, should wish to repent and gain what he had lost, it could not be, for he would find no place for repentance, though he might seek it carefully with tears; for having committed the sin unto death, for which no prayer is to be made, no intercession offered up, he is bound over to the second death, the lake of fire and brimstone, and must bear the punishment of his sins for ever and ever!!!—What say you to this?</P>

<P>As when Nebuchadnezzar told Daniel his dream, he was astonished for one hour at the greatness of the punishment which he saw would inevitably come upon the King; much more must all those be, who read and consider these dread∣ful threatenings, which must surely come upon all those who have sinned in the manner described! I shall make a few observations upon these most ter∣rible passages of Scripture; partly to prevent fee∣ble minds from falling into despair, that may see them collected in one striking view; partly to cure proud minds of presumption; and partly to shew that the doctrine of the Restoration may be de∣fended, notwithstanding.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. We are sure that the Scribes and Pharisees of our Saviour's time, who blasphemously ascribed
<PB N="62" REF="025050_0118_102D767090BA7C68"/>
his miracles to the power of the devil, did, in the most direct and undeniable manner, commit that sin; and some are doubtful whether it can be com∣mitted by any in these days.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. It is generally acknowledged, that the He∣brews were in danger of committing that sin, by openly and wilfully apostatizing from Christianity, and publicly renouncing Christ and his salvation, and blaspheming against the Holy Ghost, after having been partakers of its extraordinary gifts.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. It cannot be committed by ignorant persons, nor without a considerable degree of malice pre∣pense; light in the understanding, and malice in the heart, are necessary ingredients of this dreadful crime; and it appears to me, it must be committed openly, and that it cannot be committed in thought only.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Under the Levitical dispensation there were many unpardonable sins—crimes that could not be forgiven or overlooked, and for which no atone∣ment could be made, and which were punished with death, without mercy; other crimes, unless sacrifices were offered, and repentance took place, subjected the parties to death also; but, under the gospel, there is but one crime that is properly un∣pardonable, and that absolutely subjects the person guilty of it to the second death; yet many other sins are threatened with the same punishment con∣ditionally, but they may be forgiven, and not pu∣nished at all; but this one must as certainly be punished with the second death, as murder or any other crime, was by the law of Moses punished with the death of the body without mercy or for∣giveness. <HI>Forgery</HI> is the unpardonable sin of Eng∣land: people frequently suffer death for other
<PB N="63" REF="025050_0119_102D764138F47D78"/>
crimes, as well as this; but other offences are sometimes forgiven, but this never; it is always punished with death. This circumstance may il∣lustrate my meaning. The sin against the Holy Ghost is an offence of that kind, that, either owing to its uncommon malignity (as is most likely,) or some other cause, exposes the guilty person to the age of judgment, from which he cannot escape by repentance, pardon, and sprinkling of the blood of Christ, as other sinners may; neither can he be at present born of the Spirit, to which he hath done despite; nor can he be reclaimed by any possible means, in this age, or in the age that is to suc∣ceed this, but is inevitably bound over to suffer the inconceivable torments of the second death, or lake of fire and brimstone, after the day of judg∣ment.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. There is no kind of dispute between us, re∣specting the certainty of the punishment of such; in this we both agree: he that sinneth against the Holy Ghost, is in danger of eternal damnation, or judgment, or the second death:—The question is, Shall there ever come a time, when the second death, or lake of fire, shall no more exist? If this can be proved, the conclusion will be evident, <HI>viz.</HI> that not one shall remain under the power thereof to all eternity: Upon this, and this alone, depends the solution of this awful, interesting, and most im∣portant question: and I consider all other answers as mere quibbles, compared with this. And if it cannot be proved that a time will come, when all that bears the name of death shall be destroyed, those who commit the sin unto death, must, at least, be allowed to stand as exceptions to the general rule; and, I am apt to think, the rule itself will
<PB N="64" REF="025050_0120_102D7672224B3490"/>
be overthrown. I shall therefore labour this point a little; and if I should be so happy as to prove to your satisfaction the total destruction of death, it will answer many other objections as well as this. My only refuge is Scripture; if that fails me, I shall not presume to pursue the subject farther.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>Isa. xxv. 8. 'He will swallow up <HI>Death</HI> in vic∣tory; and Adonai JEHOVAH will wipe away tears from off all faces.' Hos. xiii. 14. 'I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem them from death, O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, (<HI>or</HI> hell) I will be thy destruction: Re∣pentance shall be hid from mine eyes.' 1 Cor. xv. 26. 'The last enemy that shall be destroyed is <HI>Death</HI> '—or rather, as the words may more proper∣ly be arranged, <HI>'Death,'</HI> the last enemy, shall be destroyed.' The second death is infinitely more the enemy of man than the first, and may there∣fore be considered as an enemy which God will de∣stroy.—Now,</P>
<P>If the last enemy shall be destroyed, there will not be one left.</P>
<P>But the first is true; therefore also the last. As,</P>
<P>Would it not be highly absurd to say, that, Al∣though the very last enemy shall be destroyed, yet, many millions shall remain to all eternity?</P>
<P>Verse 56. 'The sting of <HI>Death</HI> is sin.' While sin remains in existence, death will be able to shew its sting; but the time will come when death shall have no sting to boast of; therefore sin, and con∣sequently death of every kind, shall be destroyed. 1 John iii. 8. 'For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.' Unless Christ finally destroys the
<PB N="65" REF="025050_0121_102D764310312440"/>
works of the devil, even all sin out of the universe, his purpose must be eternally frustrated:</P>
<P>But the last can never be; therefore the first is true.</P>
<P>Heb. ii. 14. 'Forasmuch, then, as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is the devil.'—Now what death has the devil power over? the death of the body? or that of the soul, which consists in enmity against God, and separation from him? 'To be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be,' Rom. viii. 6, 7. If this death, with the consequence of it, is that which the de∣vil hath the power of, then must this death be destroyed.</P>
<P>But, I think, the first is true; therefore also the last.</P>
<P>Rev. xxi. 4. we read, 'And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more <HI>Death,</HI> neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away.' Here is a state spoken of beyond all death; a state wherein, sorrow, crying, and pain shall be no more. This state is cotemporary with the new heaven and earth, after the lake of fire hath ceased.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>We have always understood this passage to relate to the death of the body, and even to the death of the righteous only; but making this state cotemporary with the new heavens and earth, seems to throw a new light upon the subject.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="66" REF="025050_0122_102D76764BCE23F8"/>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Most certainly the word <HI>Death</HI> here implies the second death; for we are informed, in the foregoing chapter, of the first resurrection, even that of the martyrs, who were beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God; and such as had not worshipped the beast and his image, neither had received his mark in their fore∣heads, or in their hands; then we read of a thou∣sand years between this resurrectien, and the rest of the dead living again: after this, we find, that the dead, small and great, stood before God, and were judged; and such as were not found written in the book of life, were cast into the lake of fire, which is expressly called 'the second death;' which as before observed, is probably the earth in its melted state. In this chapter we find, that all things are to be made new; and <HI>Death</HI> is to be no more, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither any more pain. But this must be the second death, or lake of fire; for the resurrection of all the bodies, both of the just and unjust, had been spoken of before.</P>
<P>Thus, as all sin, and all that bears the name of death, shall be entirely destroyed at last; the doc∣trine of endless misery seems to fall to the ground, or, at least, cannot be certainly proved from Scrip∣ture, but rather the contrary.</P>
<P>The time must come when all things shall be subject to Christ, when he shall destroy death, the last enemy, by destroying sin, which is the sting of death; so this dreadful sin, as well as others, shall be no more. For if this was not to be the case, it never could be true, that 'where sin abounded, grace did much more abound:' for it never would abound quite so much; neither would death and
<PB N="67" REF="025050_0123_102D76456341C5A8"/>
hell be silent when God shall ask the great ques∣tions, 'O death where is thy sting? O grave, (<HI>or</HI> hell) where is thy victory?' for death could say, Here is my sting, that sin against the Holy Ghost, which must endure to all eternity, and which even divine grace shall never destroy; I have, therefore, the victory and dominion over these sinners who have committed it, and will hold it while God him∣self exists. Then death could never be destroyed, nor swallowed up in victory; neither would sor∣row, crying, and pain cease; neither could God ever be ALL IN ALL, in any other sense, with re∣spect to them, than he is now; nor would <HI>every tongue swear;</HI> neither would all things wholly be made new, nor all the former things ever pass away! neither could the universal chorus of praise ever be sung by every creature, in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, and throughout God's wide domain; and, finally, many Scriptures would ne∣ver seem to be fulfilled, in the fullest sense. Rom. v. 20, 21. 'But where sin abounded, grace did much more abound; that as sin hath reigned unto death; even so might grace reign, through righte∣ousness, unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord.' Now, if grace shall abound more than sin, it shall be as universal, and more powerful: But the first is true; therefore also the last. If grace shall be as extensive as sin, and more powerful, all who have sinned shall be restored: But the first is true; therefore also the last.</P>
<P>What consequences must follow from the sup∣position, that some of God's creatures shall always remain his enemies! Either God created some to be miserable to endless ages, or must be frustrated
<PB N="68" REF="025050_0124_102D767481EB2A48"/>
eternally in his designs, or all must be restored at last, and made happy by love and free love.</P>
<P>The first is blasphemous, the second is disho∣nourable to God: therefore, the third must be true: For I cannot think of a fourth conclusion.</P>
</SP>

<P>What do you think of the deplorable case of Esau, 'who, for one morsel of meat, sold his birthright; and afterwards, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place of repentance, though he sought it carefully, with tears?'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>He certainly lost, or rather sold, his birth-right; in consequence of which, he lost the blessing belonging to the first-born: But lest any should be led to conclude from this, that poor <HI>Esau</HI> had no blessings at all, the same apostle informs us, that, 'By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, concerning things to come," Heb. xi. 20. By this we find, he was blessed, as well as Jacob; but in a less degree.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Do we not read, 'Jacob have I loved; but Esau have I hated?' Rom ix. 13. Mal. i. 2, 3.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, most certainly: But then this love and hatred, so called, was manifested to their posterity, and not to their persons, in the manner described by the prophet: 'I have loved you, saith JEHOVAH: yet ye say, Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith JEHOVAH: yet I loved Jacob, and I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage waste, for the dragons of the wilderness.' This manifestation of hatred did not affect the eternal state of their souls, but their condition in this world: God declared, that Jacob's seed should exist: as a distinct people to the
<PB N="69" REF="025050_0125_102D7646F1443E60"/>
end of time, but that Esau's should not: and this difference is evident; for the remains of Esau's seed were, in the days of the Maccabees, incorporated with the seed of Jacob, and existed no more for ever, as a nation by themselves. From Jacob's race the Messiah was to come, and all nations were to be blessed in the seed of Israel. In all these in∣stances, and in many others, there was a manifest preference of Jacob to Esau; but nothing like po∣sitive hatred can be intended.</P>
<P>Christ says, (St. Luke, xiv. 26.) 'If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be my disci∣ple.' But we cannot suppose our Lord intended positive, but comparative hatred; according to St. Matth. x. 37. He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me, is not wor∣thy of me.'</P>

<P>What you have said upon this subject appears to have some weight, and I will consider it more fully hereafter: but I must beg leave to ask you, how you get over that great gulph which is placed between the regions of <HI>Paradise</HI> and <HI>Ge∣henna</HI> of which Abraham speaks to the rich man; saying, 'And besides all this, between us and you there is a great gulph fixed; so that they which would pass from hence to you, cannot; neither can they pass to us, that would come from thence.' Does not this imply the absolute impossibility of the rich man's being ever restored?</P>

<P>You have asked me many questions; give me leave to ask you one.—Do you believe,
<PB N="70" REF="025050_0126_102D767A229057C8"/>
that Jesus of Nazareth was able to pass that impas∣sable gulph?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Indeed, that is a question I never heard proposed before; and which I am not prepared to answer, without farther consideration. Pray, be so kind as to give an answer yourself, and tell me what you think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I believe, that with <HI>man</HI> it is impossi∣ble; but with God all things are possible: And I believe, that Jesus Christ was not only able to pass, but that he actually did past that gulph, which was impassable to all <HI>men,</HI> but not to him: And he as∣sures St. John, that he had passed it, and not only so, but that he had the keys of the same in his pos∣session; for he saith, 'Fear not, I am the first and the last; I am he that liveth, and was dead; and behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and death.' And St. Peter informs us; that 'Christ once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, (that he might bring us unto God); being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit; by which also he went and preached to the spirits in prison; who sometime were diso∣bedient, when once the long suffering of God waited, in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing,' And he also tells us, that we 'shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead. For, for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead,' (in distinction from them that are quick) 'that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.' See Rev. i. 18. 1 Pet. iii. 18, 19, 20. iv. 5, 6.</P>
</SP>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>You know, the common opinion is, that the Spirit of God, in Noah, preached unto the in∣habitants
<PB N="71" REF="025050_0127_102D764935535A18"/>
of the old world; who, in St. Peter's time, were shut up in the prison of hell: But I must confess, it appears to me a very dark text.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you only observe how particular the expressions are in these texts, I think it will soon appear, that not the Spirit of God in Noah, but the spirit, or soul, of Christ, in its disembodied state, is here intended. His body was doubtless quickened, by his soul, or spirit coming into it again: Was it not?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>It seems most reasonable to believe it was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then observe the next words, <HI>he went;</HI> here the idea of a journey to a distant place is in∣timated, the original word being expressive of an actual passage from one place to another, and is the same that is used in ver. 22, for the ascension of Christ into heaven, so that he appears to have gone into the prison in the same proper sense, as he afterwards went into heaven. He actually journeyed to the place of confinement, <HI>and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>each∣ed to the spirits,</HI> &amp;c. He preached <HI>the gospel</HI> no doubt, not to men in the body, but to <HI>the spirits,</HI> to those in a disembodied state; not only so, but to <HI>the spirits in prison:</HI> Had they not been in the prison, Christ would not have gone into the prison to preach to them. But, who were these spirits? St. Peter informs us, that they are those who were <HI>sometime disobedient;</HI> but this expression intimates, that the time is perfectly past; as, 'Ye <HI>were</HI> the servants of sin: for when ye <HI>were</HI> the servants of sin, ye <HI>were</HI> free from righteousness,' Rom. vi. 17, 20. St. Peter tells us when they were diso∣bedient; <HI>when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing:</HI>
<PB N="72" REF="025050_0128_102D76781820E140"/>
Here he evidently distinguishes the two periods of their visitation; one is called the preaching of Christ, by his spirit, after he was put to death in the flesh; and the other is called the long-suffer∣ing of God, which waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing. The long-suffering of God waited upon them, before they were drowned, while the ark was building; but Christ preached to them when they were spirits in prison. They were disobedient to God's long-suffering; but it is not certain that they were so when Christ preached to them; but the contrary is intimated in these words: <HI>'For, this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead,'</HI> &amp;c. This can∣not intend those that are <HI>spiritually</HI> dead only, but those whose bodies are dead; because we here find <HI>the dead</HI> set in opposition to <HI>the quick,</HI> or those whose bodies are alive, and not those that are <HI>spiritually alive;</HI> for we may observe, that whenever the words <HI>quick</HI> and <HI>dead</HI> occur, by <HI>quick,</HI> we always understand those whose bodies are alive; and by <HI>dead,</HI> those who have ceased to exist here.</P>
<P>Acts, x. 40, &amp;c. St. Peter, in his sermon to Cor∣nelius and his family, informed them of Jesus, who was slain, whom 'God raised from the dead, and shewed him openly: not to all the people, but unto witnesses, chosen before of God; even to us, who did eat and drink with him, after he rose from the dead. And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify, that it is he, who was ordained of God to be the judge of <HI>quick</HI> and <HI>dead.</HI>' And St. Paul says to Timothy, I charge thee, therefore, before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the <HI>quick</HI> and the <HI>dead</HI> at his appearing, and his kingdom;
<PB N="73" REF="025050_0129_102D764ACBD8CA88"/>
preach the word,' &amp;c. See 2 Tim. iv. 1. So, in 1 Pet. iv. 5. the words <HI>quick</HI> and <HI>dead</HI> are used in the same manner; and then immediately, while the idea is warm in our minds, the apostle gives us the reasons why the gospel was preached to <HI>the dead,</HI> (<HI>or</HI> the spirits in prison) of which he had be∣fore informed us, and now repeats again, and as∣sures us, that it was, <HI>that they might be judged ac∣cording to men, in the flesh;</HI> or, as though they had heard it while they were alive in the flesh: but also, that they might <HI>live according to God, in the spirit.</HI> The gospel not only <HI>was,</HI> but <HI>is,</HI> preached to them that are dead, in a <HI>moral</HI> or <HI>spiritual</HI> sense. It need not have been said; <HI>For, for this cause was the gospel preached</HI> ALSO <HI>to them that are dead,</HI> if only the spiritually dead are intended; for it is rarely preached to any other but such. Why should it be said, <HI>that they might be judged according to men in the flesh,</HI> if they were men in the flesh at the time when it was preached to them?</P>
<P>This passage proves the existence of the soul after the death of the body: for unless the souls of the antedeluvians existed after the drowning of their bodies, Christ could not have preached to them in prison: But the <HI>dead</HI> being opposed to the <HI>quick</HI> in this passage, sufficiently, and even incontestibly, determines the sense.</P>
<P>With a little attention, we may easily be con∣vinced, that Christ was not only designed to be a Covenant of the people, (meaning the Jews) and a Light to the Gentiles; which two descriptions comprehend all the living: but also, to bring out the prisoners from the prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison-house; which (if it
<PB N="74" REF="025050_0130_102D767BF18569F8"/>
be not a repetition) must intend the <HI>dead,</HI> as all the <HI>living</HI> were mentioned before.</P>
<P>'And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my servant, to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the ends of the earth. Thus saith JEHOVAH, In an acceptable time have I heard thee and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant to the people, to esta∣blish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate he∣ritages.' Thus far the Redeemer's work seems li∣mited to the earth, and respects the living: But the prophet goes much farther, and says, 'That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth: to them that are in darkness, Shew yourselves: they shall feed in the ways, and their pastures shall be in all high places. They shall not hunger, nor thirst neither shall the heat nor sun smite them; for he that hath mercy upon them shall lead them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.' See Isaiah, xlii. 6, 7, xlix. 6, 8, 9, 10. Compar∣ed with Rev. vii. 14, 15, 16, 17. The work of the Saviour, as described by the elegant pen of Isaiah, (chap. lxi. 1, 2, 3.) seems to comprehend a great variety of particulars; all which he hath performed already, or shall execute in due time.</P>
<P>'The Spirit of Adonai JEHOVAH is upon me; be∣cause JEHOVAH hath anointed me, (1) to preach good tidings to the meek: (2) He hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted; (3) to proclaim li∣berty to the captives, (4) and the opening of the prison to them that are bound: (5) To proclaim the acceptable year of JEHOVAH, (6) and the day
<PB N="75" REF="025050_0131_102D764CC6B1B308"/>
of vengeance of our God: (7) To comfort all that mourn: (8) To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them, <HI>First,</HI> beauty for ashes; <HI>Secondly,</HI> the oil of joy for mourning; <HI>Thirdly,</HI> the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness: that they might be called, <HI>First,</HI> Trees of righteous∣ness; <HI>Secondly,</HI> The planting of JEHOVAH; (<HI>and</HI> ALL <HI>for this great end</HI>)—that he might be glorified.'</P>
<P>Our Lord Jesus Christ, by his process, hath laid a foundation for the recovery of all men; 'For to this end Christ both died, rose, and revived, that he might be Lord, both of the dead and living,' Rom. xiv. 9. He passed through all our states, that he might redeem us. He came down from Heaven—he was conceived in the womb of Mary—he was born of her—he lived in the world unknown —he sympathized with us in our sorrows—he bare our sins in his own body, on the tree—he was bu∣ried—he descended into <HI>Hades</HI>—He arose—ascend∣ed —sitteth at the right hand of God—and maketh continual intercession for us.</P>
<P>It seemed necessary, that our Saviour should visit men in all situations, that he might redeem them. The apostle informs us, saying, 'Forasmuch as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same: that through death, he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil; and deliver them, who, through fear of death, were all their life-time subject to bondage,' Heb. ii. 14, 15. It was not only necessary that he should die, to van∣quish death, and to redeem us from its power; but it was equally needful for him to go into those places, where spirits were confined in the regions of darkness, that he might gain universal domini∣on,
<PB N="76" REF="025050_0132_102D767DB948FA60"/>
spoil principalities, and redeem the captives whom he had bought with his blood, in order that he might ascend up to Heaven, and open to his followers the gates of eternal life.</P>
<P>'Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. Now that he ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth? He that descended, is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things,' Ephes. iv. 8, 9, 10. 'And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it,' Col. ii. 15.</P>
<P>Thus our Saviour by his divine process, hath obtained a right to open the prison doors, and let the captives go free: and though the rich man was in torments, where he could not get a drop of wa∣ter to cool his tongue, and had <HI>judgment without mercy,</HI> because he had <HI>shewed no mercy;</HI> yet it is pos∣sible, that, by the blood of the covenant, he may be sent forth out of the pit wherein is no water. See Zech. ix. 11. The Lord Jesus is able to take the prey from the mighty, and to deliver the law∣ful captive, Isa. xlix. 24.</P>
<P>'Such as sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death, being bound in affliction, and iron; be∣cause they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned the counsel of the Most High; there∣fore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell down, and there was none to help.'— This evidently points out the deplorable, misera∣ble state of sinners, cut off in their sins; having rebelled against God's words, and contemned his counsels; for which reason he hath shut them up
<PB N="77" REF="025050_0133_102D764EC5E77598"/>
in darkness, and in the shadow of death; in such a situation, that no power but his own, can give them the least help, much less <HI>release.</HI> Such cir∣cumstances seldom occur in this life; but these words are a lively and affecting description of the miseries of the future state.</P>
<P>'Then they cried unto JEHOVAH in their trou∣ble, and he saved them out of their distresses. He brought them out of darkness, and the sha∣dow of death, and brake their bands in sunder. O that men would praise JEHOVAH for his good∣ness, and for his wonderful works to the chil∣dren of men! For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder,' Psal. cvii. 10—16.</P>
<P>This amazing deliverance seems to be described in such language, as corresponds much better with the deliverance of the spirits from their dreadful prison, than with any temporal mercies that are bestowed on mankind <HI>here on earth.</HI> 'The righteous shall see it, and rejoice; and all iniqui∣ty shall stop her mouth: Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall under∣stand the loving kindness of JEHOVAH,' ver. 42, 43.</P>
<P>Those who are acquainted with the Divine cha∣racter, and see his designs of mercy towards his creatures, shall rejoice in the same: They that are wise, shall observe these things, and shall under∣stand his loving kindness; and that 'JEHOVAH is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works,' Psal. cxlv. 9.</P>
<P>Thus, how impossible soever it might appear to us, that the rich man should ever be delivered, we must remember, that 'with God nothing shall
<PB N="78" REF="025050_0134_102D767F55F907D0"/>
be impossible,' St. Luke i. 37. 'Is there any thing too hard for JEHOVAH?' Gen. xviii. 14. 'Behold (says he) I am JEHOVAH, the God of all flesh: Is there any thing too hard for me?' Jer. xxxii. 27.</P>
<P>Our Saviour says, (St. Matt. xix. 24, St. Mark x. 25. St. Luke xviii. 25.) 'It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.' Whe∣ther the word here used, intends a camel or a ca∣ble, it certainly implied the greatest difficulty imagi∣nable, even amounting in the view of his disciples, to a natural impossibility, or they would not have been as the evangelist expresses it, <HI>exceedingly amaz∣ed, and astonished out of measure</HI> at his words, ' say∣ing among themselves, Who then can be saved?' But, though Jesus meant to represent the matter as in itself a kind of natural impossibility, and ab∣solutely impossible to men; yet he could not in∣tend thereby, that it never should be accomplish∣ed, because he immediately adds, 'With men, this is impossible; but not with God: For with God all things are possible,' St. Mark x. 27. Therefore, though it was impossible for <HI>men</HI> to pass the gulph between <HI>Paradise</HI> and <HI>Gehenna;</HI> yet, as we have seen, Christ was able, and therefore as we know not the <HI>ne plus ultra</HI> of his power to save, we cannot positively conclude <HI>against the Restoration,</HI> from this instance of the rich man, unless we could find some passages of Scripture, where God has promised never to restore, or to reconcile such to himself, whom he hath once cast off: the contrary to which, I think, may be proved: but I am at present considering, that, in the nature of things, it is not impossible for God to restore the rich
<PB N="79" REF="025050_0135_102D76508B1887C8"/>
man, if he so pleases; and, consequently, others that are in the same situation.</P>
<P>Behold the rich man in another world!—He seems <HI>now</HI> to have much more true benevolence in him, than in his life-time; for when he could not obtain a drop of water for his tongue, he pleads much more earnestly for Lazarus to be sent to his five brethren, to testify to them, lest they also should come into the same place of torment with himself. Here he urges the matter most earnest∣ly, and does not seem willing to be denied. This shews him not to have been so lost to virtue as Sa∣tan; since he and his angels, though miserable themselves, seek to make all men so too, though their torments are increased thereby.</P>
<P>Add to all this, that Abraham called the rich man, <HI>'Son,'</HI> and bade him remember, that in his life-time he had his good things: and likewise La∣zarus, evil things; and that therefore it was but reasonable that the scene should be changed: that Lazarus should be comforted, and he tormented. And I think, nothing can be fairly argued from his case, in favour of <HI>endless damnation:</HI> For in case he was doomed to suffer <HI>while God exists,</HI> there could be no proportion between the sufferings, torments, and evil things of Lazarus on earth, and those which <HI>he</HI> endured in hell; whereas it is inti∣mated in the Scriptures, that all things are deter∣mined by number, weight, and measure. Let us hear what our Lord has said upon the subject. St. Luke xii. 47, 48. 'And that servant who knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with MA∣NY stripes. But he that knew not, and did com∣mit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with
<PB N="80" REF="025050_0136_102D76815F1A8A28"/>
FEW stripes: for unto whomsoever much is given, of him shall be much required; and to whom men have committed much, of him they will ask the more.' But what difference, so much to be noti∣ced, could there be, if both were to be beaten <HI>to all eternity?</HI> or how could either be said to have FEW, if there never was to be an end? Impossible <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Rev. xviii. 7. 'How much she (Babylon) hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously; so much torment and sorrow give her.' All this appears just and reasonable: But to suppose a poor ignorant Heathen, or a child of ten years old, will remain in misery as long as the most persecuting Tyrant, or apostate Christian, seems to contradict all the ideas we have of justice and equity, as well as of goodness; for in this case, who can suppose that each one is exactly rewarded according to his works? And especially, can any think, that <HI>mercy</HI> has any hand in a reward, where there is seeming∣ly no proportion? Whereas we read, (Psalm lxii. 12.) 'Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to every man according to his work.'</P>

<P>Indeed, I could not have thought that so much could have been said upon that side of the case; and though I am not yet wholly satis∣fied, I must confess, some of my great difficulties seem to be removed, from what you have said; and yet there appears something very dreadful in the account.

<P>I am most inclined to think it is a piece of real history, known to our Saviour, who was well acquainted with what passed in the spi∣ritual, as well as the natural world; and who in∣tended

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am inclined to think with you in this matter: and therefore, without any farther delay, I shall pass to mention another strong objection to the doctrine of the Restoration of all men; <HI>viz.</HI> the instance of <HI>J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>das:</HI> of whom our Saviour says, 'The Son of man goeth, as it is written of him; but woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed; it had been good for that man, if he had not been born, St. Matt. xxvi. 24. St. Mark, xiv. 21. If Judas should ever be restored, how could the Saviour say, 'Good were it for that man, if he had never been born?' I think you wil find it difficult to remove this objection; for, if he is ever to be happy, (though after many ages) it will be good for him that he was born.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cannot think that this is so strong an argument against the general Restitution, as most that use it imagine. It was a common proverb among the Jews, when any great misfortune hap∣pened to a man, or his family, to say, 'Good were it for that man, if he had never been born.' And thus our Saviour used it with great propriety respecting Judas: for who, that thinks with any reason at all, would not have wished that he had never been born, rather than to have betrayed the dear Redeemer?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can any thing less than <HI>endless</HI> dam∣nation be sufficient to justify the expression of 'Good were it for that man, that he had never been born?'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="82" REF="025050_0138_102D76832AEEC4B8"/>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am of opinion that even worldly troubles (short as they are) may sufficiently justify the expression. There are a thousand circumstan∣ces into which the children of Adam fall, that make their case infinitely worse than though they had never been born, even without supposing a state of future punishment at all. I had rather, a thou∣sand times, never have been born, than to have be∣trayed Christ, even upon the supposition that I had never been doomed to suffer for it beyond this life. Job, when he had lost his substance, his children, and his ease, opened his mouth, and, through excess of grief cursed the day of his birth: though it does not appear that he had any fear of future damnation, but the reverse.</P>
<P>'And Job spake, and said, 'Let the day pe∣rish wherein I was born; and the night in which it was said, There is a man-child conceived. Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above; neither let the light shine upon it. Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud dwell upon it: let the blackness of day ter∣rify it. As for that night, let darkness seize upon it: let it not be joined unto the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months. Lo! let that night be solitary; let no joyful voice come therein. Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise up their mourning. Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the day; because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from mine eyes. Why died I not from the womb? Why did not I give up the ghost, when I came out of the belly? Why did the knees prevent
<PB N="83" REF="025050_0139_102D7654767DD058"/>
me? or, why the breasts that I should suck? For now should I have been still, and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest, with kings and counsellors of the earth, who built deso∣late places for themselves; or with princes, that had gold, who filled their houses with silver: Or, as an hidden, untimely birth, I had not been; as infants, who never saw light. There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be at rest. There the prisoners rest together: they hear not the voice of the oppresser. The small and great are there; and the servant is free from his master,' See Job, iii. 2—19.</P>
<P>From this discourse, it seems, that Job thought it would have been better for him never to have been born, than to have fallen into such fore trou∣bles in this present life, without taking the other into his account; but if he had known that he had been doomed to suffer the amazing torments of the second death, in the lake of fire and brim∣stone, what would he have said? Even upon the supposition that it was only to last for ages, he would have thought that his being born into this world, to be fitted for such a punishment, would have been the greatest curse that could have be∣fallen him.</P>
<P>If Job, who could say, 'I know that my Re∣deemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the lat∣ter day upon the earth: And, though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall see God: whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and not another; though my reins be consumed within me. He knoweth the way that I take; and when he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. My foot hath held his
<PB N="84" REF="025050_0140_102D7684F941F580"/>
steps; his way have I kept, and not declined; nei∣ther have I gone back from the commandment of his lips: I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food. Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will maintain mine own ways before him. He also shall be my salvation. My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart shall not reproach me so long as I live.' (See Job, xix. 25, 26, 27. xxiii. 10, 11, 12. xiii. 15, 16. xxvii. 6.) And who could make such a solemn protestation of his inno∣cence and uprightness, before God and man, as we find in the xxix. xxx. xxxi. chapters of that book. If such a man had reason to say, 'Where∣fore, then, hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh! that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me! I should have been as though I had not been; I should have been carried from the womb to the grave,' (See Job x. 18, 19.) with what amazing propriety might Christ say of Judas, the traitor, who sinned in such a dreadful manner, and had such horrible guilt on his conscience: who died in black despair, perished in such an aw∣ful situation, in his sins, and, probably, by his own hands: who suffered the most violent agitations of mind, died under the power of the horrid sugges∣tions of the great enemy of men, without one smile, or look of forgiveness, from Jesus, or even daring to seek it; whose sorrow in this life far exceeded Job's, (for Job had no sense of guilt, treason, and ingratitude; nor was he filled with rage, blasphe∣my, and despair)—and who must probably have his portion in the second death;—'Good were it for that man, if he had never been born! even up∣on
<PB N="85" REF="025050_0141_102D76567615D340"/>
on the supposition that his torments are not de∣signed to continue <HI>while God exists.</HI></P>
<P>Jeremiah is another instance much to my pur∣pose; who wished that he had never been born, even at the very time when he knew the Lord was his helper; only because he had been put in the stocks by Pashur, and had suffered a little pain and shame in a good cause. He was not afraid of <HI>end∣less damnation,</HI> nor yet of any future punishment: for he thus expressed himself, in all the language of full assurance; 'But JEHOVAH is with me, as a mighty terrible One: therefore, my persecut∣ors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail; they shall be greatly ashamed, for they shall not prosper; their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten. But, O JEHOVAH of Hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them (<HI>or,</HI> thou wilt let me see, &amp;c.) for unto thee have I opened my cause. Sing unto JEHOVAH, praise ye JEHO∣VAH: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evil doers. How strong his faith! how full his assurance! Yet it is evident, that he thought it would have been much better for him, personally, never to have been born; for he immediately adds, 'Cursed be the day wherein I was born; let not the day wherein my mother bare me, be blessed. Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A man child is born unto thee, making him very glad. And let that man be as the cities which JEHOVAH overthrew, and repented not: And let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noon∣tide; because he slew me not from the womb: or that my mother might have been my grave: and
<PB N="86" REF="025050_0142_102D7686F37EDC80"/>
her womb to be always great with me. Where∣fore came I out of the womb, to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?' See Jer. xx. 11-18.</P>
<P>Here is not a word about a state of future pu∣nishment, much less <HI>endless damnation,</HI> and yet the good prophet Jeremiah thought, that if he had never been born, it would have been far better for him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess, I never before considered it possible to answer this objection; you have done much towards solving it: but you must consider, that both Job and Jeremiah passionately exclaimed, and, through sorrow, uttered such rash words, as, in their cooler moments, they repented of; and therefore, what they spake of themselves cannot wholly set aside the objection. Had they deliver∣ed those expressions as general truths, and declared, that men had much better never have been born, than to have suffered such degrees of worldly sor∣row, it would have more than answered the objec∣tion; but, when men under grief exclaim in such a manner, we cannot ground a matter of such im∣portance upon what they say respecting themselves; as their minds, being overwhelmed with trouble, and the immediate sensations of pain, are biassed, and cannot utter the calm dictates of sober reason. But Christ, though under great sorrows himself, saw the case of Judas so deplorable, that he ex∣pressed himself thus respecting him; which was the sober truth, without exaggeration; and could this be said of him, or of any other of the hu∣man race, upon the supposition that misery is not absolutely endless?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="87" REF="025050_0143_102D765808B82998"/>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>We do not find that Job or Jeremiah ever recanted, in their cooler moments, what they uttered in their sorrows; and our Lord, speaking of the destruction of Jerusalem, says, 'And woe unto them that are with child, and to them that give suck in those days,' See St. Matth. xxiv. 19. St. Mark, xiii. 17. Not because of their future, endless damnation, in distinction from others; but on account of their present trouble and sorrow; as is explained, Luke xxi. 23. 'But, woe to them that are with child, and to them that give such, in those days: for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.' And when the Saviour was led to death, we read, 'And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him. But Jesus, turning unto them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but for yourselves, and for your children. For behold the days are coming, in the which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bare, and the paps which never gave suck. Then shall they say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us. For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?' St. Luke, xxiii. 27—31.</P>
<P>And who would not, a thousand times, choose rather never to have been born, than even to see, far less experience, the miseries which came upon Jerusalem and its inhabitants? Would it not have been better for mothers never to have been born, than to have killed and eaten their own children in the siege? And would it not have been better for the children never to have been born, than to have been food for their mothers?</P>
<P><PB N="88" REF="025050_0144_102D7688F0F927B8"/>
But Solomon not only represents a state of great misery and affliction in this life, as worse than not to have been born, but also, a state of the greatest prosperity, if it ends in disgrace; for he says, 'If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled with good; and also, that he have no burial; I say, that an untimely birth is better than he. For he (the untimely birth) cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness; and his name shall be covered with darkness. Moreover, he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this hath more rest than the other. Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he seen no good:' (<HI>i. e.</HI> no equivalent good, to balance his disgrace). 'Do not all go to one place?' All came from dust, and turn to dust again. See Eccles. vi. 3, 4, 5, 6.</P>
<P>The state here described by Solomon, is not only infinitely better than the damnation of hell, though limited by certain periods; but far preferable to many, if not to most situations of men in this life: and yet he prefers an untimely birth to a man who lives more than twice the age of Methuselah, and has an hundred children of his own, if he has not his soul filled or satisfied with good; and that he hath no burial, or has not honour, (credit, <HI>or</HI> re∣putation) at his death.</P>
<P><HI>Long life</HI> and <HI>many children,</HI> were formerly es∣teemed as the greatest of blessings: but as the things of this life cannot fill the soul with good; so a man had better never have been born, than to have enjoyed the good things of this world in the greatest profusion, if he dies in disgrace, and has no burial, or is not honoured at his death. Yet,
<PB N="89" REF="025050_0145_102D765A0007C448"/>
this is not worthy to be named in the same day with the damnation of hell; yet, is frequently threatened as a great and terrible judgment; which, if it falls upon a man, however he may have en∣joyed long life, health, wealth, and all kinds of prosperity; it makes it worse for him than if he had never been born, according to the decision of God himself; and, therefore, no wonder that Christ said of wicked Judas; 'Good were it for that man, if he had never been born.'</P>
<P>Though I have answered you so largely, yet one word might have sufficed to have answered the whole objection at first; <HI>viz.</HI> Had Judas died be∣fore he had been born, and perished from his mo∣ther's womb, he would never have sinned, far less betrayed Christ; he would have entered into peace immediately, 'where the wicked cease from troubling, and where the weary are at rest:' In that case, he would have escaped the judgment that came upon him, and would have had more rest than those who should live in all the affluence of life two thousand years, and beget each an hun∣dred children, and yet should not be honoured at their death.</P>
<P>Some would have answered the objection short∣er, by saying, Christ promised twelve thrones to his twelve apostles, among whom Judas was one; and therefore, he must be restored, or the promise cannot be fulfilled: See St. Matth. xix. 28. But this I do not insist upon; nevertheless, those who answer the objection this way, make an observa∣tion that may be worth attention; <HI>viz.</HI> that Peter, speaking of Judas, saith, 'Let his habitation be de∣solate, and let no man dwell therein;' that is, Let
<PB N="90" REF="025050_0146_102D768ABB145420"/>
his mansion be reserved for him, let no man take possession of it; but 'His bishopric, or office, let another take.' See Acts, i. 20. compared with Psal. lxix. 25. cix. 8. But I am rather of opinion that the desolation of the habitation of the wicked, and the want of inhabitants in their tents, respects this state, and is part of the curse pronounced up∣on all traitors; and may therefore in an eminent sense, be applied to Judas, and also to the rebel∣lious nation of the Jews at large; and therefore, as these words do not intend their Restoration, so neither are they any objection to it; for St. Paul applies part of the lxixth Psalm to the Jews, as truly as St. Peter applies it to Judas: See Rom. x. 9, 10. And yet he says, 'I say then, Have they stumbled, that they should fall? God forbid: But rather, through their fall, salvation is come unto the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy. Now, if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?' And thus, form the 11th verse to the end of the chap∣ter, goes on to speak of their being again received, reconciled, and grafted again into their own olive tree; and that their blindness is only for a time: 'And so all Israel shall be saved: There shall come out of Sion a deliverer, and shall turn away un∣godliness form Jacob:' That God's covenant, or promise, is to take their sins away; that they are beloved for the fathers sakes; that the gifts and calling of God are without repentance; that, therefore, they shall obtain mercy at last; and that, for this very purpose, God hath concluded them all (<HI>or</HI> shut them up) in unbelief, that he might
<PB N="91" REF="025050_0147_102D765BCB547B70"/>
not only punish them thereby for their transgres∣sions, and also, through their unbelief, cause the the Gentiles to obtain mercy and salvation; but also, that he might have mercy upon all those whom he had thus shut up in unbelief, without exception. See the whole chapter.</P>
<P>Here, then, are three designs, worthy of a God of infinite wisdom, power and goodness, in this one dark dispensation, the rejection of the Jewish church and nation:—1. That he might punish them for their iniquity:—2. That others might come in their room, stand in their office, and be made partakers of their privileges: and 3. That they might be reserved to mercy and forgiveness at last. And what happened to a whole nation of traitors, might happen to an individual of that na∣tion; and <HI>vice versa.</HI></P>

<P>One grand objection that is very gene∣rally made against the doctrine of the Restoration<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is, that it tends to <HI>licentiousness;</HI> that it is the doc∣trine that the serpent preached to Eve; for we read, (Gen. iii. 4.) 'And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:' and that it is a doctrine calculated to give encouragement to the wicked to continue in their evil ways; that it is 'saying, Peace, peace, when there is no peace;' and that this doctrine is as dangerous as that of the wicked prophetesses of Ezekiel's time, of whom GOD says, 'With lies ye have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he

should not return from his wicked way, by pro∣mising him life. They say unto them that despise me, JEHOVAH hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say unto every one that walketh after the imagina∣tion of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you,' Jer. viii. 11. Ezek. xiii. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Jer. xxiii. 17.</P>
<P>It is said, that it is the nature of God to lay the highest possible restraint upon sin, and, therefore, he has threatened it with eternal, or <HI>endless</HI> punish∣ment: and this is even found too weak to prevent the prevailing of iniquity. What a flood of im∣piety, therefore, would overflow the world, if it should be generally believed, that after some ages of suffering, mankind should be restored to some degree of happiness? Would not the restraints be wholly taken off from the lusts and passions of the wicked, if once this doctrine should become pre∣valent? Will you be so kind as to give a fair and candid reply to this objection?</P>

<P>This objection is stated with all possi∣ble force, I shall, therefore endeavour to answer it as well as I can; putting in this caveat, that if I should not answer it to your satisfaction, do not imagine that no solid answer can be given; but im∣pute it to my not being sufficiently master of my subject, or not being able to express my mind so clearly as I could wish. As this objection is fre∣quently made, and often used, by people who mean well, but have not considered the subject thoroughly, I shall be as explicit as possibly I can upon it.</P>
<P>I would first observe, that the great truths, or first principles, upon which the Restoration is founded, and form which it is derived by natural and easy consequences, are far from tending to li∣centiousness:
<PB N="95" REF="025050_0151_102D76BD1825CEF8"/>
But, in order to make this evident, it will be proper here to set them down in their order.</P>
<P><HI>First Principles, upon which the Doctrine of the final and universal Restitution is founded.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. GOD <HI>is the universal and only creator of all:</HI> contrary to the opinion of the <HI>Manichees</HI> of old, who believed the <HI>devil</HI> to be the creator of most, if not all visible beings: The <HI>Mugglet<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nians,</HI> of the last century, and the <HI>Buchanit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> lately, assert nearly the same sentiments; contrary to Rev. iv. 11. Col. i. 16. Psal. c. 3. Numb. xvi. 22. Isai. lxiv. 8. Ezek. xviii. 4. Zech. xii. 1. and a vast number of other Scriptures.</P>
<P>Now, who can say, that this noble thought, which St. Paul enlarges upon so beautifully, (Acts, xvii. 24—30.) tends, in the least, to make men wicked? Does it not tend to dignify and en∣noble human nature, to be told, that GOD is our Father, Creator and First Cause; and that we were made by his power, according to his will, and for his pleasure; and that the <HI>chief end</HI> for which he made us, was, <HI>to glorify his name, and to enjoy him for ever?</HI>—as the Assembly's Catechism beautifully declares. This is one of the principles from which GOD himself deduces the certainty of the final end of wrath, as I have observed before:—'For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made,' Isai. lvii. 16.—Those who venture to contradict their Maker, and say, that he <HI>will contend for ever, and be always wroth;</HI> ought to be able, at least, to give as good
<PB N="96" REF="025050_0152_102D7690C1C63D28"/>
a reason why <HI>he will,</HI> as he has assigned why <HI>he will not;</HI> and consequently prove, that he hath <HI>not made all souls;</HI> which is the true founda∣tion upon which endless misery must be founded, and the only doctrine which is perfectly consistent with it.</P>
<P>The poor untutored <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> argued (with a missionary that was sent from <HI>Sweden</HI> to convert them) from the universal providence of GOD, that he, who was so kind a Father as to pro∣vide for their bodies all things needful, had not wholly neglected their souls: But this I do not insist upon, though, I think, the argument has weight in it; and, certainly, the providential good∣ness of GOD, and his long-suffering, tends to lead men to repentance: Rom. ii. 4. 2 Pet. iii. 9.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The universal benevolence of the Deity,</HI> or the <HI>love</HI> of GOD to his creatures, is one of the first principles from which the general Restoration is deduced: and who can say, that this leads to li∣centiousness? If those who believe that GOD loves them, in particular, find <HI>that</HI> consideration the strongest obligation on them to love him again, and to obey his will; by the same rule, if all the in∣dividuals of the whole human race, were to be∣lieve that GOD loved each one of them, would not the same cause produce the same effect? And if so, can this be charged as a licentious doctrine, which is expressly grounded upon a cause which power∣fully operates to produce holiness? Is there any thing like argument in this reasoning: I know that GOD loves me, and seeks to do me good; there∣fore, I must hate him. What should we think of a woman who should leave her husband, and do all in her power against him, and should be able
<PB N="97" REF="025050_0153_102D76BF296657C8"/>
to give no better reason for it than the following: My husband loves me, and I know it, and he has always loved me, and always will; and, therefore, I am determined to hate, ridicule, despise, and con∣temn him, and have left him for this very cause, and am determined never to love or obey him more? Bad as human nature is, I question whe∣ther such instances often occur. We commonly say, that love begets love: 'We love him, because he first loved as;' says the Apostle, 1 John, iv. 19. Therefore, the doctrine of GOD'S universal <HI>benevo∣lence,</HI> cannot lead to licentiousness, in any light in which it can be viewed; for, if he really loves us, he will do all in his power to bring us to love him again, and to be like him; and I am sure, the con∣sideration of his love to us, goes as far as moral suasion can go, to induce us to love him again, nay, the belief of it is acknowledged to be one of the strongest motives to obedience; and the love of GOD, shed abroad in the heart, produces the best effects, and is the most powerful principle, and spring, of good and virtuous actions, that we are acquainted with. This being a first principle, from which the universal Restoration is concluded, we are happy to find, that 'GOD is love:' and that he 'so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life: For, GOD sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world: but that the world, through him, might be saved,' See 1 John, iv. 16. St. John, iii. 16, 17. But it is not so much my business now to shew, that the sentiment is scriptural, as to shew that it is not of a dangerous tendency. The fol∣lowing words, however, are so beautiful, that I
<PB N="98" REF="025050_0154_102D769251B58220"/>
take the liberty to mention them:—'But thou hast mercy upon all; for thou canst do all things, and winkest at the sins of men, because they should amend. For thou lovest all the things that are, and abhorrest nothing which thou hast made: for never wouldest thou have made any thing, if thou hadst hated it, And how could any thing have endured, if it had not been thy will: or been pre∣served, if not called by thee? But thou sparest all; for they are thine, O Lord, thou lover of souls. For thine incorruptible Spirit is in all things: There∣fore chastenest thou them, by little and little, that offend, and warnest them, by putting them in re∣membrance wherein they have offended, that leav∣ing their wickedness, they may believe on thee, O LORD. For thy power is the beginning of righte∣ousness; and because thou art the LORD of all, it maketh thee to be gracious unto all. But thou, O GOD, art gracious and true: long-suffering, and in mercy ordering all things. For if we sin, we are thine, knowing thy power; but <HI>we will not sin,</HI> knowing that we are counted thine:' Wisdom of Solomon, xi. 23—26. xii. 1, 2, 16. xv. 1, 2. 'JEHOVAH is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger, and of great mercy. JEHOVAH is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works. All thy works shall praise thee, O JEHO∣VAH; and thy saints shall bless thee,' Psal. cxlv. 8, 9, 10.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another great principle, upon which the Restoration depends, is, <HI>that</HI> CHRIST <HI>died for all;</HI> 'We see <HI>Jesus,</HI> who was made a little lower than the angels, for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour; that he, by the grace of GOD, should taste death for <HI>every man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>(<HI>or</HI> ALL)
<PB N="99" REF="025050_0155_102D76C0F1B6D268"/>
Heb. ii. 9. 'If <HI>any man</HI> sin, we have an Advo∣cate with the <HI>Father, Jesus Christ,</HI> the righteous: And he is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the <HI>whole world,'</HI> 1 John, ii. 1, 2. 'For there is one GOD, and one <HI>Mediator</HI> between GOD and <HI>men,</HI> the <HI>Man</HI> CHRIST JESUS: who gave himself a ransom for <HI>all</HI> to be testified in due time,' 1 Tim. ii. 5, 6.</P>
<P>I need not multiply passages to prove that <HI>Christ</HI> died for <HI>all;</HI> for though the universality of his <HI>death</HI> is not expressly asserted, in every text where it is mentioned that he died, it must always be under∣stood; because it is never denied in any place, and is plainly, and pointedly declared in those which I have quoted: And, besides, it is evident that in the apostles time, the <HI>universality</HI> of the death of Christ was a first principle, universally acknow∣ledged, and, therefore, St. Paul reasons from it as such; which it would have been highly prepos∣terous for him to do, if that had not been the case: As, for example, 'For the love of <HI>Christ</HI> con∣straineth us; because we thus judge, that if one died for <HI>all,'</HI> (which is not disputed by any, and which we know to be a truth) 'then were <HI>all</HI> dead: And that he died for <HI>all;</HI> that they who live, should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him that died for them, and rose again,' 2 Cor. v. 14, 15.</P>

<P>But have you never heard it argued that <HI>Christ</HI> did not <HI>die</HI> for <HI>all,</HI> because he did not <HI>pray</HI> for <HI>all?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I remember, when a lad, I was seat to a neighbour's house, and overheard the good man, the master of the family, read in a book, after this manner: <HI>'Christ</HI> did not die for <HI>all,</HI> because
<PB N="100" REF="025050_0156_102D769416F574E8"/>
he did not pray for <HI>all:</HI> I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for they are thine,' St. John, xvii. 9. And I then thought the argument conclusive: But I am now at a loss whether the author of that book meant to deceive his readers; or, whether he had never read the chapter through critically: for, had he read the 20th verse, he would have found these words, which would have overthrown his hypothesis:—'Neither pray I for these <HI>alone;</HI> but for them <HI>also,</HI> who shall believe on me through their word.' If <HI>Christ</HI> had prayed for all, in the 9th verse, for whom he died, he could not have enlarged his prayer so much in the 20th verse, as to take in not them only, but all that should be∣lieve on him through the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> word: Neither does he stop here, but goes on to pray for those that believe, in these words: 'That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee; that they also may be one in us:' And, why is all this uni∣ty prayed for among believers? Surely, it hath never been accomplished; but it shall be, for this great and admirable purpose <HI>viz.</HI> 'That the <HI>world may believe</HI> that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me, I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me; that they may be made perfect in one, and that the <HI>world may know</HI> that thou hast sent me, and hast loved them, as thou hast loved me,' verses 21, 22, 23.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But when shall the <HI>world believe,</HI> and <HI>know</HI> that <HI>Christ</HI> is the <HI>Sent</HI> of <HI>God?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>When all that believe shall be <HI>one,</HI> as the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son</HI> are <HI>one:</HI> When the great marriage of the <HI>Lamb</HI> shall be celebrated, and his
<PB N="101" REF="025050_0157_102D76C285593B70"/>
Bride shall be <HI>one,</HI> in the bond of universal love and fellowship, as the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Son</HI> now are: When the Church shall be perfected in <HI>one;</HI> shall dwell in love, and dwell in <HI>God,</HI> as the <HI>Father</HI> dwells in the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Son</HI> in the <HI>Father:</HI> When <HI>Zion's</HI> watchmen shall see eye to eye: When all believers shall speak the same thing; when there shall be no more divisions among them; when they shall be perfectly joined together in the same mind, and in the same judgment.</P>
<P>This was the state that St. Paul besought the Corinthians to press after, and wished them to at∣tain; but he had the mortification to see them fall short of it, as all the Christian churches have, from that day to this. But when <HI>Christ</HI> shall give that glory and honour to his Bride, which the <HI>Father</HI> gave to him, and shall thus unite her to himself, in an indissoluble union, and the several members of his body, the Church, shall be as much united one to another, as the members of the natural body are; or, to express it in his own words, 'As thou, <HI>Father,</HI> art in <HI>me,</HI> and <HI>I</HI> in <HI>thee;'</HI> When thus the Church shall be one, in spirit, love, de∣sign, judgment, &amp;c. as the <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Son</HI> are; then shall the <HI>world believe,</HI> and believing, have life; then shall the <HI>world know</HI> him, whom to know is life eternal: See verses 2 and 3, But as this great <HI>cause</HI> has never yet existed, the <HI>effect</HI> has not yet followed; but when the <HI>first</HI> shall be, the <HI>last</HI> shall take place in consequence.</P>
<P>The petitions in that most excellent prayer, that may, with great propriety, be called the LORD'S Prayer, may be divided into four classes: 1. For himself, verses 1st and 5th: 2. For his apostles, 9—19: 3. For them that should believe, through
<PB N="102" REF="025050_0158_102D7695E1D291C0"/>
their word, verses 20, 21, 22, 23: And, 4. for the world, verses 21, 23; as I have just observed, and need not add any more upon so plain a mat∣ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Proceed, if you please, to shew, that the doctrine of the <HI>universality</HI> of the death of <HI>Christ</HI> does not lead to licentiousness.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is evident that it doth not; but, on the contrary, it is the strongest motive to all who believe it, to love and live to him who died for them, and rose again : We <HI>are not our own, but are bought with a price;</HI> therefore, we are exhorted not to be the servants of sin, slaves to our passions, and servants to men: but to glorify GOD in our bo∣dies and sprits, which are his: and the apostle be∣seeches us, by the mercies of GOD, to present our bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto GOD; which is our reasonable service. Foras∣much, as we know that we were not redeemed with corruptible things, as silver and gold; but with the precious blood of <HI>Christ,</HI> as of a <HI>Lamb</HI> without blemish, and without spot; See 2 Cor. v. 15, Rom. vi. 12, 13. 1 Cor. vii. 23. vi. 19, 20. Rom. xii. 1. 1 Peter, i. 18, 19.</P>
<P>What a horrid thought would it be, that <HI>Christ</HI> should be the minister of sin, and that his blood-shedding should cause wickedness to abound? The love of GOD, in giving his <HI>Son</HI> to die, is enough to move an heart of stone; 'For when we were yet without strength, in due time, <HI>Christ</HI> died for the ungodly: for, scarcely for a righte∣ous man will one die; yet, peradventure, for a good (kind, benevolent, generous) man, some would even dare to die. But GOD commendeth his love towards us, in that, while we were yet
<PB N="103" REF="025050_0159_102D76C44C7B6F40"/>
sinners, <HI>Christ</HI> died for us. Much more, being now justified through his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies, we were reconciled to GOD by the death of his <HI>Son;</HI> much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life,' Rom. v. 6—10.</P>
<P>Here the death of the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> is laid as the ground, and the salvation of men inferred from it, with the greatest possible certainty; yet, will any one say, that because <HI>Christ</HI> hath died for him, therefore he will indulge himself in sin? God for∣bid. Some say that if they believed this doctrine, they would live in sin, and indulge themselves in their lusts and passions: but then it may be ob∣served, that those who say so are its enemies, and those who oppose the view, and not those who receive it.</P>
<P>There is something so brutish and unaccounta∣ble in such dispositions, as would lead men to hate their best friends, merely because they are so; that would lead them to hate GOD, because he loved them; and despise <HI>Christ,</HI> merely because he died for them; that, for the honour of human nature, I would hope, these instances are rare. But to the point. I have conversed with many who believed that <HI>Christ</HI> died for them in particu∣lar; and yet I never heard them say, that they hated him for it; but, on the contrary, that they loved him exceedingly. Now, is not the same cause likely to produce the same effect? If a thou∣sand persons, for instance, all believing that <HI>Christ</HI> died for them, find their hearts constrained to love him for it, would it not have the same effect upon ten thousand, ten millions, or ten millions of mil∣lions? And if it would cause licentiousness to
<PB N="104" REF="025050_0160_102D7697AEB23D28"/>
abound in the world, to preach that <HI>Christ</HI> died for all, if it was universally believed; by the same rule it must cause it to prevail, in a lesser degree, to preach that he died for a small part, at least, a∣mong those who believe themselves to be of the the number; and, therefore, it must not be preach∣ed at all, that he died for any? Who can deny the consequence? It seems to be evident, that <HI>Christ</HI> has done and suffered too much for those that he died for, to lose them finally: and thus the uni∣versal Restoration stands connected necessarily with the universality of the death of <HI>Christ,</HI> and is de∣duced therefrom, in the easiest manner; therefore, the doctrine of the <HI>former</HI> cannot tend to licenti∣ousness, as it stands upon the ground of the <HI>latter,</HI> which hath been demonstrated to have no such tendency.</P>
<P N="4">4. Another principle upon which the universal doctrine depends, is, <HI>the unchangeableness of God:</HI> Whom he loves once, he always loves; he loved his creatures when he made them, as none can well deny; their sins he never loved, nor ever will; he hath declared, that he loved us when sinners, but never <HI>as</HI> sinners. His eternal and constant hatred of all sin, and his unchangeable love of all his creatures, are of the nature of pri∣mary truths; from which the doctrine of the ge∣neral Restoration may be easily and plainly infer∣red. In this view we may understand those ma∣ny dreadful threatenings and gracious promises, made to the same people and persons: Both shall be fulfilled; the first, while they continue as rebels, which are designed to humble and subdue them; the last, when they shall have accepted of the punishment of their iniquity; when their
<PB N="105" REF="025050_0161_102D76C6A072EE38"/>
uncircumcised hearts are humbled, when their stubborn knees shall bow to JEHOVAH, and their former rebellious tongues shall swear allegiance to him.</P>
<P>Does this idea lead to licentiousness, that GOD hates sin, and determines to pursue it to entire de∣struction, and never to put up his sword, so long as there is a rebel in the universe; yet, at the same time, has no positive hatred to the souls which he has made, but only wishes them to return to or∣der?—This idea appears to me, equally to check presumption and despair; and tends to put an end to licentiousness, rather than to encourage it: For, if rebels are assured that their rightful sove∣reign hates them, and will never suffer them to be reconciled to him, it naturally causes them to fight with tenfold rage, as all warriors will testify; as, on the other hand, if they believe he is too weak, or undetermined, to conquer them, they will be presumptuous, and continue the war. It cannot, therefore, be affirmed, by any persons of reason, that the declaration that GOD will destroy sin, tends to promote it; or, that his love of order, and hatred of evil, being compatible with his love to the creatures he has made, is a doctrine that encourages men to rebel; the contrary is evi∣dent: and yet these are the very grounds of the universal Restoration; which cannot, therefore, be licentious.</P>
<P N="5">5. Another of the first principles of the Restora∣tion, is, the <HI>immutability of</HI> GOD'S <HI>counsels;</HI> which he hath confirmed by an oath, 'That by two im∣mutable things, (<HI>viz.</HI> his word and oath) in which it was impossible for GOD to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled for refuge, to
<PB N="106" REF="025050_0162_102D76997947D568"/>
lay hold upon the hope set before us,' Heb. vi. 17, 18. 'God hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself. That in the dispensation of the fulness of times, he might gather together (<HI>or</HI> rehead) in one, all things in <HI>Christ,</HI> both which are in heaven, and which are on earth: even in him: in whom we have obtained an inheritance, being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh <HI>all things</HI> according to the counsel of his own WILL,' Ephes. i. 8, 9, 10, 11. GOD is our Saviour, (<HI>or Soteros,</HI> Restorer) who will have all men to be saved, (<HI>sothenai,</HI> restored) and to come unto the knowledge of the truth,' 1 Tim. ii. 3, 4. This is the will and counsel of that GOD, who 'doeth according to his will in the armies of heaven, and and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?' Dan. iv. 35. He hath sworn by himself, the word is gone out of his mouth in righ∣teousness, and shall not return, that unto him 'every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear,' Isai. xlv. 23. The counsel of GOD shall stand; he will perform his pleasure, notwithstanding all the opposition that men can make: 'GOD is not a man, that he should lie, neither the son of man, that he should repent: Hath he said, and shall he not do it? or, hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?' Numb, xxiii. 19. If GOD will have all men to be saved, or restored, and to come to the knowledge of the truth, if it is his good plea∣sure, which he hath purposed in himself, in the dispensation of the fulness of times, to rehead all
<PB N="107" REF="025050_0163_102D76C8A466F458"/>
things in <HI>Christ,</HI> both in heaven and on earth; if he hath sworn, that unto him every knee shall bow, and every tongue shall swear; and if he worketh all things after the counsel of his own will, and is determined to perform all his pleasure, which he is able to do; and with him nothing that he pleases is impossible: I say, if all these things are true, (as who, that believes the Scrip∣tures, can deny?) then, is not the doctrine of the Restoration true? And who will venture to charge that with licentiousness, which GOD, in the counsel of his will, hath purposed, and is determined to perform? We know, the will of GOD is a will to all goodness, and that he cannot do any thing un∣just, or contrary to his holy nature, or inconsist∣ent with his plan of moral government, or that shall tend to promote rebellion; therefore, if GOD had seen that this great work had been, in any re∣spect, injurious to his perfections, character, go∣vernment, &amp;c. he would not have proposed it; and if he had foreseen that the knowledge of it would have been hurtful to mankind, he would not have revealed it: But since he hath done both, we may certainly argue, that it is not a licentious doctrine to declare, that GOD will finally make all his intelligent creatures happy; by making them all his subjects, by destroying their sins, and mak∣ing them holy, in a way perfectly consistent with all his perfections and attributes; without doing the least injury to his character, or rendering his moral government weak, or making any of his words void, whether threatenings or promises, or in the least setting aside the sanctions of his law or gospel, or a future state of rewards and pu∣nishments; without derogating at all from the
<PB N="108" REF="025050_0164_102D769B821CA258"/>
glory of the Mediator, but rather exalting it to the highest possible pitch; without saddening the hearts of the righteous, or diminishing, in the least, from the happiness of Heaven, but rather causing it to increase; for if there is joy in Heaven over one sinner that repenteth, there must be more over many, in exact proportion; and as God will certainly give the greatest possible joy to his chosen, and there is no doubt but it will receive addition from every one that is restored, or brought home to himself; therefore, it can only be brought to its highest possible pitch by the <HI>universal Restora∣tion;</HI> which doctrine cannot, therefore, be licenti∣ous, as God has appointed and revealed it, and all holy beings (except some weak good men on earth) rejoice therein exceedingly.</P>
<P N="6">6. Another of the principles on which the <HI>gene∣ral Restoration</HI> is founded, is, <HI>that</HI> God <HI>hath given all things into the hand of</HI> Christ, who hath declar∣ed, <HI>that it is the Father's will, that of all that he gave him, he should lose nothing:</HI> and that power was giv∣en him over all, that he should give the knowledge of God, even eternal life, to all that the <HI>Father</HI> had given him; and that <HI>all,</HI> without exception, whom the <HI>Father</HI> hath given, shall come in such a man∣ner, as not to be cast out: But as all these Scrip∣tures have been recited, and reasoned upon before, I shall only now observe, that as GOD the FATHER hath given <HI>all</HI> things to CHRIST, and as he hath engaged to bring <HI>all</HI> back, without exception, and hath both <HI>will</HI> and <HI>power</HI> to perform this work, and came into the world on purpose to accomplish it, it must, of consequence, be finally performed; yet, it cannot tend to licentiousness, or the God of Heaven, and the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> would never

have planned it approved of it, or sought to ex∣ecute it.</P>
<P>Many more first principles, on which the doc∣trine of the <HI>Restoration</HI> is founded, might be menti∣oned, and shewn to be far from tending to licenti∣ousness: but I shall mention but one more; and that is—<HI>The Scriptures must be fulfilled; the Scrip∣tures cannot be broken:</HI> None or the words of God can fail of being accomplished; and he hath not only denounced dreadful threatnings, but made many gracious promises to the same people: These cannot be fulfilled together; and, if there is no truth in the Restoration, I cannot see how the <HI>lat∣ter</HI> will ever be fulfilled at all; and if sins are not punished in the persons who commit them, I am equally at a loss what sense or truth there can be in the <HI>former.</HI> It would be a great task to collect all the texts which justify the remark, that threatenings and promises belong to the same people in differ∣ent periods, some specimens of which have been given in the course of these dialogues. Now, it cannot lead to licentiousness, to suppose that the Scriptures shall all be fulfilled; but it must lead to infidelity, and all kinds of evil, to suppose the contrary.</P>
<P>These are the first principles upon which the doctrine of the Restoration stands, and by which it is supported; and as these have all been consider∣ed, and proved to have no tendency to encourage sin, separately, much less can they have any such tendency, jointly; and then it evidently follows, that a doctrine which seems necessarily deduced, or inferred by undeniable consequences, from all these considerations united, cannot be false, or have any evil tendency.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="025050_0166_102D769D17A617A8"/>
But I shall next proceed to shew, that all true, experimental, and practical religion, seems so con∣sistent with the <HI>universal Restoration,</HI> that it may be reckoned a wonder, that all who have tasted that the Lord is gracious, and have diligently practised his commands, have not, in all ages, been fully convinced of the truth of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Is it possible that you can do this? If so, I hope your reasoning will be attended to; and I must confess, that you have cleared your way so well, by considering the first principles of the doc∣trine, and shewing that they are very far from tending to licentiousness, that I am half inclined to think you will be able to answer this objection, formidable as it has been considered hitherto.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>As I trust you have been made ac∣quainted with experimental religion, I need only to appeal to your own experience, for the truth of what I advance; and I am apt to think, if you will answer me candidly, to a few questions, you must acknowledge either that the Restoration is true, or that your experience is false.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am willing to give you as plain and candid answers as I can; for it will be of no use to deny what the Lord has done for my soul.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Let me then ask you, in the first place, Did you not see yourself lost and undone; and that you were vile before God, unworthy of his mercy, and totally unable to deliver yourself from your sin and misery?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I certainly did; and I was sometimes ready to think there was hardly such a sinner on earth as myself, all circumstances considered; for I had sinned against such light and love, that I
<PB N="111" REF="025050_0167_102D76CCB14A6880"/>
thought all the world might be forgiven sooner than myself.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>And were you not brought by the power of God, to resign yourself into his hands, without reserve, to do with you, and dispose of you, according to his will and pleasure; being con∣vinced, that he neither would nor could do you any injustice?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>O yes; and then I found peace; my rebellion against God ceased; I looked upon him quite different from what I did before; I saw that he was wholly right and just, and that I was entirely to blame: my murmurings against him ceased; I viewed him as such a holy, good, mer∣ciful, and yet righteous God, that I could trust my soul in his hands, with the most entire satis∣faction.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>And when <HI>Christ</HI> was revealed to you as a <HI>Saviour,</HI> how did he appear?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>As one able and mighty to save, even to the uttermost; and I thought there was not only a sufficiency in him for me, the vilest of all, but for the whole world, yea, for a thousand worlds, had there been so many. His blood seemed to me so precious, his obedience and sufferings so meritori∣ous, his power so great, his love so rich, bound∣less, and free, that I was overcome with the trans∣porting view: and as I saw in him a fulness for all, so I found in him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> infinite willingness to save all; for how could I think otherwise? I knew my∣self to be most unworthy, and that he had graci∣ously pitied me: I beheld his love, like a river, flowing down to me as free as water: and I was amazed that I had not beheld it before, in the same light. I saw, that the love of God to me, did not
<PB N="112" REF="025050_0168_102D769F0D9D9880"/>
now <HI>begin,</HI> but was now <HI>manifested</HI> to my soul. I saw that there was no change in God, but all in myself. Those words were precious to my heart at that time: 'Yea, I have loved thee with an everlasting love; therefore with loving kindness have I drawn thee,' Jer. xxxi. 3. As also these: 'Son be of good cheer: thy sins be forgiven thee,' St. Matth. ix. 2.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have brought my own experience to my mind:—It pleased GOD, by an incident too trifling to mention, to bring me to seek earnestly for an unfading treasure; and, by a train of cir∣cumstances, fixed the concern deeply upon my mind; and I laboured night and day, but could obtain no rest, till one morning—a time never to be forgotten!—as I was walking on a journey, un∣der great distress, and when deliverance seemed farther from me than ever, all at once, I was brought to resign my soul into the hands of GOD, and thus I expressed myself: 'Lord, here I am: a poor helpless sinner: I resign myself into thine hands; take me, and deal with me, just as thou pleasest: I know thou canst do me no injustice.' Immediately these words came into my mind, with great power and sweetness: 'In an acceptable time have I heard thee; and in a day of salvation have I helped thee,' Isai. xlix. 8. and I had then such a view of CHRIST, as made me to cry out 'Glory to God in the highest! This is salvation; I know this is salvation!' Then those passages which you have mentioned, came into my mind with great energy; and I saw the fulness, sufficiency, and wil∣lingness of CHRIST to save me, and all men, in such a manner as constrained me to venture my soul into his arms; and if I had had ten thousand souls, I
<PB N="113" REF="025050_0169_102D76CE7AD2F1D8"/>
could have trusted them all in his hands. And, O how did I long, that every soul of Adam's race might come to know the love of God in CHRIST JESUS! And I thought, I could not be willing to live any longer on earth, unless it might please God to make me useful to my fellow-creatures.
<Q><L>'What peaceful hours I then enjoy'd!</L>
<L>'How sweet their mem'ry still!</L>
<L>'But they have left an aching void</L>
<L>'The world can never fill.'</L></Q></P>
<P>This is a little abstract of what God did then graciously teach me by his Spirit; but I had been brought up in the particular system, and in the course of a few years came to be so firmly attach∣ed to it, as to refuse in my preaching, to make ge∣neral invitations to mankind at large; rightly rea∣soning with myself, that if provision was only made for a small part, I had no warrant to call or invite the whole to come and partake; and there∣fore only pressed the duty on such and such charac∣ters, as <HI>hungry, thirsty, weary, heavy-laden,</HI> such as were <HI>without money, sensible sinners,</HI> &amp;c. all of which I concluded to be of the <HI>elect,</HI> because I judged the Spirit had begun to operate savingly up∣on their hearts; and that to these, and these only, the Scriptures directed invitations to be made; ne∣ver considering that text—'Hearken unto me, ye stout-hearted, that are far from righteousness. I bring near my righteousness; and it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry,' Isa. xlvi. 12, 13. During the time that I remained in this close-hearted system, labouring with all my might to maintain it, I chanced to come to a house,
<PB N="114" REF="025050_0170_102D76A187A45450"/>
where, as far as I can judge, was a very sensible and pious young woman, whom I never saw be∣fore or since: She gave a very judicious account of the work of grace upon her heart: but when she came to that part, where she said she beheld an infinite fulness in CHRIST for ALL the world, I in∣terrupted her, and told her, That could not be; for there was no provision made for all, and there∣fore it was impossible that she could have any such discoveries made to her by the Spirit of God. This I insisted upon, according to my system, contrary to my experimental knowledge; (O the mischiefs of bigotry, prejudice, and vain attachment to sys∣tem!) she, on the contrary, maintained, that she clearly viewed matters in that light; and that she certainly was taught to believe, that in Christ there was a fulness and freeness for all: This I denied; and she was thereby prevented from finish∣ing what she had begun. I can never forgive my∣self, for the opposition I made to what I knew to be truth by experience; and as I did not enquire the name of the person, I have had no opportunity of making a recantation by letter, as I ought to have done; and having never been in the place since, and it being highly improbable that ever I shall again, I feel myself extremely hurt, whenever I think of it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can but admire the agreement between us in matters of experience; for I found the same dispositions of mind that you mentioned, when it pleased <HI>God</HI> to reveal his <HI>Son</HI> in me.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I never found an experienced Christi∣an in my life, but would give much the same ac∣count, provided that his system was not in sight; and I have found some, that though they were vi∣olently
<PB N="115" REF="025050_0171_102D76D04817EE10"/>
attached to the contrary system, and knew my intention in asking the questions; yet answer∣ed the following affirmatively.</P>
<P>Did you not see and feel yourselves the vilest of sinners?</P>
<P>Did you not view the love of GOD infinitely full, free and unmerited?</P>
<P>Did you not behold in <HI>Christ</HI> an infinite fulness, sufficiency, and willingness, to save all, without exception?</P>
<P>Did you not love all, and wish that all might come and partake of his grace?</P>
<P>Did you not earnestly desire the salvation of all, not only of your family, friends, neighbours, and nation; but also of your enemies, and of all man∣kind? Could you not embrace the whole human race in the arms of benevolence?</P>
<P>Did you not find it in your heart to pray for the salvation of all mankind, as for your own?</P>
<P>If you had as much power as good-will, would you not bring all to bow to the sceptre of grace, and to be reconciled to <HI>God</HI> through <HI>Jesus Christ?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I do not see how an experienced person can refuse to say Yes, to all these questions; they are so agreeable to the very tempers of the new∣born soul; and, I am sure, I found them in my heart, at the very time when I first tasted of the love of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well then, my friend, let me ask you, From whence did these tempers and dispositions proceed?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>To be candid, I think they were given me from above, and came down from the Father of lights, from whence every good and perfect
<PB N="116" REF="025050_0172_102D76A31679C4D8"/>
gift cometh; and I am the more apt to think so, because I found contrary dispositions in my heart before; and the more I am sensible of the forgiv∣ing love of God, the more I find these affections which you have described, and these desires for the good of others.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then let me ask you, Can a small drop be larger than the unfathomed abyss and ocean of Love? Have you more compassion towards your fellow-creatures than the God that made them? Can any effect be greater than its cause? Would you bring all to submit to God, and be happy, if you could? and will not he, to whom nothing that he pleases to do is impossible, bring all his creatures to be reconciled to himself at last? He has infinitely more love to his creatures, than all the saints and angels in glory have; he is possessed of infinite power and wisdom, as well as love; all means to accomplish the work are known to him: he can do it in a way that shall cause his praise to abound exceedingly, in a way perfectly consistent with all his perfections, and the whole of his glo∣rious character; it is his will and purpose so to do, as has been proved at large; What, then, can hin∣der him from fulfilling it?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am not able to gainsay this reasoning; it seems almost undeniable: But can you shew that the doctrine of the Restoration stands connected with practical religion, or the keeping of the com∣mandments of God?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can very easily do that, in every in∣stance; but shall only attend to the following, as a specimen.</P>
<P N="1">1. Our Lord has commanded us to <HI>love all man∣kind;</HI> not our brethren and friends only, but even
<PB N="117" REF="025050_0173_102D76D1E90966D0"/>
our greatest enemies; and all for this purpose, that we may be the children of our Father, who is in Heaven, whose love is universal, and whose tender mercies are over all his works: See St. Matth. v. 44—48. St. Luke, vi. 27—36. But if God doth not love all himself, Christ hath commanded us to be <HI>more perfect,</HI> in that respect, than our Father, who is in Heaven; which, to suppose, is highly absurd. What shall we say to that doctrine that teaches us, that God hates, with a perfect hatred, many of those whom he hath commanded us to love as ourselves?</P>
<P>Therefore, there is nothing in the doctrine of the Restoration, contrary to the love of our neigh∣bour; which on the contrary is promoted there∣by.</P>
<P N="2">2. We are commanded to <HI>do good to all men,</HI> as we have opportunity. This is recommended to us by the example of our heavenly Father, who mak∣eth his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the just, and on the unjust;' and no person can say, that the belief of this doc∣trine tends, in the least, to hinder us from doing good to all our fellow-creatures; but rather en∣courages us so to do, from the consideration that God loves them all, and does good to all, and is determined to make them all the subjects of his kingdom at last.</P>
<P N="3">3. We are commanded to <HI>forgive all men their trespasses,</HI> and to pray; saying, 'Forgive us our (debts, <HI>or</HI>) trespasses, as we forgive (our debtors, <HI>or</HI>) them that trespass against us;' St. Matth. vi. 12. St. Luke, xi. 4. And our Lord says, 'For, if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Fa∣ther will also forgive you: But if ye forgive not
<PB N="118" REF="025050_0174_102D76A527A75248"/>
men their trespasses, neither will your Father for∣give your trespasses;' St. Matth. vi. 14, 15. See also, chap. xviii 21—35. St. Mark, xi. 25, 26. St. Luke, vi. 37.</P>
<P>Now, is it possible to suppose, with any degree of reason, that our Lord would command us, upon pain of his highest displeasure, to <HI>forgive</HI> those whom he hated, and determined to punish while he should exist, without having the least desire or design to do them good? Has he promised us the greatest blessings, if we will forgive all men; and will he never forgive them? He that can believe this, let him believe it. However, since forgiving all men is a plain command, which none can deny; I trust, no one will venture to say, that believing the final Restoration of all men, at last, will have any tendency to make us break this precept of our <HI>Saviour's,</HI> upon which he lays so much stress; but, I think, the contrary is evident.</P>
<P N="4">4. We are commanded to <HI>pray for all men:</HI> St. Paul says, 'I exhort, therefore, that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of thanks, be made for all men: For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God, our Saviour, (<HI>or</HI> Restorer) who will have all men to be saved, (<HI>or</HI> restored) and to come unto the knowledge of the truth. For there is one God, and one Medi∣ator between God and men, the man <HI>Christ Jesus:</HI> who gave himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time.' This is the great doctrine of the Gospel, the very foundation of Christianity:— 'Whereunto I am ordained a preacher, and an apostle; (I speak the truth in Christ, and lie not) a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and verity.' The apostle not only believed, but taught; not only
<PB N="119" REF="025050_0175_102D76D3B58877C0"/>
taught, but commanded others to teach and preach this great doctrine, of God's being the Saviour, or Restorer, of all men: In this he gloried, say∣ing, 'This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation. For therefore we both labour and suf∣fer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Saviour (<HI>or</HI> Restorer) of all men, spe∣cially of those that believe. These things command and teach.'</P>
<P>Upon this grand foundation, St. Paul recom∣mends prayer to all men; saying, 'I will there∣fore, that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting,' 1 Tim. ii. 1—8. iv. 9, 10, 11.</P>
<P>Observe, the apostle recommends prayer for all men: and wills, that men should pray every where, at all times, and in all places, lifting up holy hands, without <HI>wrath</HI> and <HI>doubting.</HI> How nearly forgiv∣ing all men, and praying for all men, stand con∣nected! and both are plainly and peremptorily re∣commended by our Lord; who says, 'Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which des∣pitefully use you, and persecute you.'</P>
<P>We are commanded to pray for all men, because it is the will of God that all men should be saved; (<HI>or</HI> restored) and because Christ hath given him∣self a ranson for all: And we are bid to pray <HI>with∣out doubting:</HI> O, what a word is this! May we, ought we, to pray for the salvation of all men, without <HI>doubting?</HI> Surely, God would never have commanded us to do this, unless it was his pur∣pose to restore all men, in his own time; and no man can say, that the belief of the Restoration will prevent our praying for all men.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="025050_0176_102D76A7191353A8"/>
I was once on a journey, and called in at the house of one of my former good friends: Several religious persons were there; and, after some time, my sentiments came to be spoken of, and they seemed to wonder how I could embrace the opi∣nion, that all men, finally, would be saved! I told them, however many might preach against it, that no person, under the influence of the Divine Spi∣rit, could pray <HI>against it;</HI> but, on the contrary, we could pray <HI>for it</HI> in faith, nothing wavering, as God had commanded, and as his Spirit naturally inspired: that no person could pray God not to save or restore all mankind, without being shocked at the blasphemy and impiety of such a prayer; but that our Lord had said, that all things whatsoever we asked in prayer, believing that we should re∣ceive, should be granted, let them be things seem∣ingly ever so impossible; that if we asked any thing according to his will, it should be done; and that it was his positive and declared will, that all men should be saved, (<HI>or</HI> restored) and come to the knowledge of the truth: that we were ordered to pray for it in faith, without doubting; and, there∣fore, it was as evident as the nature of things re∣quired, that it would be done; since God had ne∣ver ordered us to pray for any thing that he was not able and willing to do. This, and much more, I said, and they seemed exceedingly well satisfied; especially, when I informed them, that it was through the blood of Christ, the blood of the co∣venant, that the prisoners should be sent forth out of the pit wherein is no water, and that all should be restored through his mediation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then you hold that even the damned shall be finally restored and delivered by the pow∣er
<PB N="121" REF="025050_0177_102D76D5B9BC6D10"/>
of Jesus, and through his blood-shedding. I have heard it objected against your scheme, that it tended to set at nought the whole mediatorial plan, and to depreciate the blood of Jesus, which he shed to purge our sins away; though I never observed any thing like this in your discourses, either in pub∣lic or in private.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>No: God forbid that I should ever set aside the blood that cleanseth from all sin; nor can I be charged with it, unless having a much higher idea of its merit than my opposers, may be looked upon as tending to depreciate it. They hold that it shall cleanse a small number from their sins; I believe that it shall cleanse, heal, and restore the whole human race. They believe that its virtue endures for a little season; I maintain that it shall continue to all ages, until all evil shall be destroy∣ed out of the universe.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am satisfied that you do not mean to set at nought the powerful blood of the dear Re∣deemer, but on the contrary, you suppose that your views tend more to exalt it. Pray proceed in your discourse.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I need not say much more upon this matter; Our <HI>Saviour</HI> has said, 'If any man will do his (the Father's) will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of myself,' St. John vii. 17. This is the surest rule: practise religion; love, revere, and serve God; love all men, even your enemies; do good to all, forgive all, and pray for all; and then ask, Is the doctrine of the final Restoration con∣trary to this manner of life? If it be, reject it; for these commands are plain: and if these princi∣ples are inconsistent with the observation of these
<PB N="122" REF="025050_0178_102D76A8E43103C0"/>
precepts, then avoid them, as you would death and hell. But, I trust, it has been shewn, that they have no such tendency; but the contrary. For instance, Does this doctrine tend to make us hate God, and his character? Does it naturally fill our minds with <HI>selfishness,</HI> and prevent <HI>benevo∣lence</HI> from ruling within us? Does it fill us with <HI>pride,</HI> and cause us to look down with contempt upon those that are beneath us in life; and banish <HI>humility</HI> from our hearts? Does the belief of this, cause our breasts to swell with pale <HI>envy,</HI> and ran∣corous malice, at the happiness of others? Does it cause us to burn with hellish <HI>rage,</HI> fury, and madness, against mankind? Does it tend to destroy <HI>meekness,</HI> and increase <HI>wrath?</HI> If these questions require (either from the nature of things, or from known facts) the answers to be in the affirmative; then I would abhor such a system, and wish it to be universally detested: But if, on the contrary, the candid enquirer must answer in the negative, and say, That the doctrine of the final Restoration does not tend to produce <HI>selfishness, envy, pride,</HI> or <HI>wrath;</HI> but, on the contrary, 'Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good-will towards men;' that it causes <HI>benevolence, meekness, humility, forbearance, forgiveness, charity,</HI> and all <HI>goodness,</HI> to abound and increase; then it cannot be a licentious doctrine, and is not to be discarded on that ac∣count; for it is a maxim with St. John, that 'He that loveth his brother, abideth in the light, and there is none occasion of stumbling in him,' 1 John, ii. 10. That is, he cannot receive, hold, maintain, or do, any thing essentially or materially wrong; and, therefore, can give no just occasion of of∣fence: 'For, all the law is fulfilled in one word,
<PB N="123" REF="025050_0179_102D76D787810540"/>
even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. For he that loveth another, hath fulfilled the law. For this, Thou shalt not commit adul∣tery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Love work∣eth no ill to his neighbour: therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law,' Gal. v. 14. Rom. xiii. 8, 9, 10.</P>
<P>But it is not only from reasoning, but from facts, that I am able to prove that the belief of the doc∣trine of the universal Restoration, does not lead men to sin. The Tunkers, or German Baptists, in Pennsylvania, and the states adjacent, who take the Scriptures as their only guide, in matters both of faith and practie, have always (as far as I know) received, and universally, at present, hold these sentiments: But such Christians I have never seen as they are; so averse are they to all sin, and to many things that other Christians esteem lawful, that they not only refuse to swear, go to war, &amp;c. but are so afraid of doing any thing contrary to the commands of Christ, that no temptation would prevail upon them even to sue any person at law, for either name, character, estate, or any debt, be it ever so just: They are industrious, sober, tem∣perate, kind, charitable people; envying not the great, nor despising the mean: They read much, they sing and pray much, they are constant attend∣ants upon the worship of God; their dwelling-houses are all houses of prayer: They walk in the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blame∣less both in public and private: They bring up
<PB N="124" REF="025050_0180_102D76AAAA0BF250"/>
their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; no noise of rudeness, shameless mirth, loud, vain laughter, is heard within their doors: The law of kindness is in their mouths: no sourness, or moroseness, disgraces their religion; and what∣soever they believe their Saviour commands, they practise, without enquiring or regarding what others do.</P>
<P>I remember the Rev. Morgan Edwards, former∣ly minister of the Baptist Church in Philadelphia, once said to me, 'GOD always will have a visible people on earth; and these are his people at pre∣sent, above any other in the world.' And in his History of the Baptists in Pennsylvania, speaking of these people, he says: 'General redemption they certainly held, and, withal, general salvation; which tenets (though wrong) are consistent. In a word, they are meek and pious Christians; and have justly acquired the character of <HI>The harmless Tunkers.</HI>'</P>
<P>Thus have I proved that this doctrine is not li∣centious; both from the first principles on which it is founded, from the nature of experimental and practical religion, and from fats. As to that part of the objection, which supposes this doc∣trine to be the same that the serpent preached to Eye, saying, 'Ye shall not surely die;' it seems al∣most unworthy of notice: But as it has been glo∣ried in by some writers, as unanswerable, merely because it was passed over unnoticed, as being nothing to the purpose; I shall make a few remarks upon it.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I say, that <HI>Satan</HI> was a liar, and GOD was true▪ For man and woman did <HI>die,</HI> in a <HI>moral</HI> sense, on the very day that they sinned; they be∣came
<PB N="125" REF="025050_0181_102D76D947F9DEC0"/>
dead in trespasses and sins; they lost the di∣vine life, and became earthly, sensual, devilish; darkness in their understandings, stubbornness in their wills, and disorder in their affections, ren∣dered them unfit, unable, and unworthy, to have fellowship with their God. But do they contradict JEHOVAH, and join with the serpent, who assert, that JESUS, the second <HI>Adam,</HI> hath quickened, and is able to quicken, those who were dead in trespasses and sins? If so, St. Paul joined with the serpent, in Ephes. ii. 1.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The sentence of death was pronounced upon man, even the death of the body, in those words: 'In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return,' Gen. iii. 19. But, would it be just and right for any one to say, that those who be∣lieved the resurrection of the body, contradicted God, and, joining with the serpent, declared, that men should not die; merely, because they asserted, according to the promises, that they should rise again? Would not those who preach <HI>Jesus,</HI> and the resurrection, have a right to look upon it as a vile and wilful slander, if any one should so mis∣represent the matter? What! must I be accused of saying, that no man ever died, because I believe and teach, that some have risen, and that all shall be raised, at last: when even the very idea of a resurrection, presupposes a state of death?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I confess, that God has threatened sinners with the second death: but do I say, that they shall never taste of the second death, because I declare, that the time will come when it shall ex∣ist no more? This is curious reasoning, indeed.</ITEM>

<P><PB N="126" REF="025050_0182_102D76AC3A18E108"/>
As well may I say, that no man ever lived on earth, because so many have died; that no one sleeps in the night, who wakes in the morning; or, that no fish was ever in the water, that was caught and taken out.</P>
<P>Did St. Paul join with the serpent, when he said, 'For as in <HI>Adam</HI> all die, even so in CHRIST shall all be made alive?' 1 Cor. xv. 22. Will any suppose that we affirm, that the dreadful threatenings denounced by God, never were, nor ever will be executed, because we declare, that his promises shall also be fulfilled? Can any reasona∣ble man suppose, because Christ is the Saviour of men, that, therefore, they were not in a lost con∣dition? How absurd! when he declares, that he came to seek and to save the lost!</P>
<P>Thus, though mankind died a moral death, in the day wherein they sinned; yet, CHRIST is able to quicken and raise them up from the same: and though their bodies die, in consequence of the fall; yet shall he cause all that are in the graves, to hear his voice, and come forth: and, by the same rule of arguing, though many shall fall under the power of the second death, which is threatened to sin∣ners; yet as he has promised to destroy all that bears the name of <HI>death,</HI> their Restoration may be fairly concluded, without either contradicting God, or joining with the serpent. Had the Scriptures, indeed, contained nothing but threatenings of <HI>death,</HI> without any promises of <HI>salvation, resurrection,</HI> or <HI>restoration;</HI> it would have been presumptuous for us to have entertained any hopes for the human race, or their deliverance, either from <HI>sin, death,</HI> or <HI>hell:</HI> but, since <HI>promises</HI> are found, as well as <HI>threatenings,</HI> we must not, under pretence or co∣lour

of believing the <HI>latter,</HI> reject the <HI>former,</HI> lest we are found contradictors and opposers of God; for it is as possible that we may make him a liar, in refusing to believe the record he has given of his Son, and his intentions of grace and mercy to∣wards mankind, as in disregarding his threatenings, denounced against them because of their sins.</P>
<P>As for this doctrine making the <HI>hearts of the righteous sad whom</HI> GOD <HI>would not have made sad,</HI> nothing can be more contrary to fact; for if it be the will of God to reward and punish, and finally to restore mankind, none of the righteous will be sorry, but, on the contrary, will greatly rejoice. It is not God's truth, but men's lies, of which the prophet speaks; which made the hearts of the righteous sad, and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life: But we are so far from strengthening the hands of the wicked, and saying, that no evil shall come upon them; that we declare from the Scripture, that 'the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven, against all ungodli∣ness and unrighteousness of men, who hold the truth in unrighteousness; unto them that are con∣tentious, and do not obey the truth, but obey un∣righteousness, indignation and wrath, tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that doeth evil; of the Jew first, and also of the Gentile,' Rom. i. 18. ii. 8, 9. And that 'there is no peace to the wicked,' Isai. xlviii. 22. lvii. 20, 21. There∣fore, they are called to repent, and turn to God; for in sin they never can be happy: no unholy, or unclean thing can enter into the kingdom of Hea∣ven. And so far are we from promising them life in their wicked ways, that we testify, from the
<PB N="128" REF="025050_0184_102D76AE4E7E2CB0"/>
Scripture, that 'He that believeth not the Son, shall not see life,' while he continues in that state; 'but the wrath of God abideth on him,' St. John, iii. 36.</P>

<P>I had intended to propose that text as an objection to your system; it is, indeed, one that Dr. WHITBY insists much upon: But I see how you will answer it—that the unbeliever, as such, <HI>and while he so continues,</HI> cannot see life; but the wrath of God abideth on him, while he remaineth in unbelief; but that God can take away the cause, in his own time, and then the effect shall cease.</P>

<P>Certainly, this must be the meaning: for St. John only meant to describe the difference between believers and unbelievers, <HI>as such;</HI> but could not mean to intimate, that those who were unbelievers, in his time, should always continue so.</P>
<P>But I now pass to consider the latter part of this objection, upon which I have dwelt so long; <HI>viz.</HI> that it is the nature God to lay the highest possible restraint upon sin, and, therefore he has threatened it with <HI>everlasting damnation,</HI> which must intend <HI>endless misery;</HI> and as this restraint is found too weak, wholly to prevent evil, what an amazing increase would there be, if this restraint should be taken off, in any degree; as it must be, if it should come to be known that punish∣ments were only <HI>for certain ages or periods,</HI> and de∣signed for the <HI>amendment</HI> of the sufferers?</P>
<P>I once asked a Reverend Divine, what was his strongest argument in favour of <HI>endless punishment?</HI> and he told me, this which is mentioned above; and, therefore as it is of considerable importance, I shall give it a brief consideration.
<LIST>
<PB N="129" REF="025050_0185_102D76DD6FABBC40"/>
<ITEM>1. It is not quite clear to me, that it is the na∣ture of God to lay the highest possible restraint up∣on sin; and that he always doth so, in all his dis∣pensations. He sometimes has higher designs in view, than barely to restrain sin: he sometimes, perhaps, suffers it to prevail for a time, that his power might be more manifest in destroying it: hence we read, 'Moreover, the law entered'—not merely to restrain sin, but—'that the offence might abound: but where sin abounded, grace did much more abound; that as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign, through righteousness, unto eternal llfe, by <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> our Lord. Wherefore, then, serveth the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come, to whom the promise was made,' Rom. v. 20, 21, Gal. iii. 19. St. Paul says; 'Sin, taking occasion by the command∣ment, wrought in me all manner of concupis∣cence; for, without the law, sin was dead. Was, then, that which was good, made death unto me? God forbid: But sin, that it might appear sin, working death in me, by that which is good; that sin, by the commandment, might become exceeding sinful,' Rom. vii. 8, 13. Perhaps, if the punishment of sins immediately followed the commission of them, it would be a stronger and more effectual restraint than any threatenings of future misery; yet God does not think it necessary to restrain sin by that mean, though it is express∣ly asserted that, 'Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore is the heart of the sons of men fully set in them to do evil.' Eccles. viii. 11. There is no doubt but if the awful punishments of the future state were
<PB N="130" REF="025050_0186_102D76B01A250228"/>
made visible to our senses, by any means, they would prove a powerful restraint to sin; yet God has not thought fit to restrain it by those, and perhaps many other possible ways; Wherefore, I have a right to doubt the premises; for, if the strongest possible restraints were laid upon sin, it might not be so consistent with a state of proba∣tion, as those reasonable restraints which God hath thought fit to lay upon it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. But it may be questioned, whether there is not something in the idea of limited, yet certain pu∣nishment, so just, equitable, reasonable, and evi∣dent; that is much more calculated to produce belief, and consequently more effectual to destroy false hopes of escaping it, and also to check that daring presumption, which rises out of the idea of <HI>endless misery,</HI> than can be found in the contrary doctrine. <HI>Endless punishment</HI> seems to shock ten∣der minds, at least. I heard of a little boy, to whom his mother constantly kept preaching dam∣nation without end, for every sin; one day, after she had been discoursing with him in that manner, he went to work, but soon returned back, sud∣denly opened the door, and with an air of sur∣prise, cried out; 'Why, mother, the law says, <HI>'An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, a foot for a foot;</HI> but you say, ten thousand for one, and that punishment shall never end.' I have heard of numbers that had no better excuse for sinning greedily, than this, <HI>viz.</HI> that there was no hopes of their being saved; that, therefore, they were determined to sin as much as possible, since it could make no difference. I have reason to say, from what I know of mankind, that more persons refuse to believe in Divine Revelation,
<PB N="131" REF="025050_0187_102D703350E69D48"/>
because it is commonly thought to contain the doctrine of <HI>endless misery,</HI> than from any other cause: And numbers have embraced it immedi∣ately, upon being fairly convinced that it was not necessary to understand it in that light. And a very sensible Deist once said to an acquaintance of mine, who believed and preached the universal doctrine; 'Had I been acquainted with your system, thirty years ago, I should have been a zealous Christian; and as great a friend to Reve∣lation, as I have been an enemy.' 'And, pray, why not now Doctor?'—'Because I am ashamed, having so long been fighting against, to receive it now.'</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Though damnation has been commonly un∣derstood to be <HI>endless,</HI> for many ages; yet it has not (as far as we can judge) prevented evil at all, or very little: but I have mentioned before, how very strict those people live, who receive and hold the system of limited punishments: whether it is, that <HI>endless damnation</HI> is too unnatural to be be∣lieved, and that <HI>limited punishments,</HI> being more reasonable, seem more certain; or whether it be, that by considering they shall be punished, either without end, or not at all; and every one think∣ing that endless punishment is more than they de∣serve, but is only reserved for some greater sinners, and therefore they have nothing to fear from it, I shall not pretend to determine; but certain it is, that where the idea of endless misery prevails, it has not prevented iniquity, in the measure that might have been expected, on the supposition of its being the truth of GOD.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. The great number of Heathens, that die with∣out ever being favoured with the light of the gos∣pel,
<PB N="132" REF="025050_0188_102D76B1E5EEFFA0"/>
and certainly without ever hearing of endless misery; the many that die in a state of infancy and childhood; together with the instances of ide∣ots, and persons born deaf; all convince me, more than any logical arguments, that God has many ways of instructing and reclaiming his creatures, in another state, that we are at present unacquaint∣ed with.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. It is not so much the intention of God, mere∣ly to restrain sin, as to shew it in all its dreadful deformity, punish it according to its deserts, and, finally, to shew the super-abounding of his grace, in overcoming and totally destroying it out of his creation; which shall be accomplished when He that sitteth upon the throne shall make all things new; 'And there shall be no more death, nei∣ther sorrow, nor crying; neither shall there be any more pain; for the former things are passed away,' Rev. xxi. 4.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. As the doctrine of the final Restoration, has been shewn in itself not to have the least tendency to licentiousness, but directly the reverse; and, as far as I can learn, by history, or my own observa∣tion, those who have believed it, in the manner here laid down, as perfectly consistent with a fu∣ture state of rewards and punishments, have been particularly careful to depart from iniquity of eve∣ry kind: yet if any should be so lost to all that is good, as to pervert this truth (revealed for contra∣ry purposes) to their own destruction, they alone must bear the blame, the loss, and the punish∣ment. The Scriptures, of truth have been per∣verted; yet, that is no argument against Divine Revelation: The Gospel of the Grace of GOD, has been abused; but should it never be preached
<PB N="133" REF="025050_0189_102D76E0F062F298"/>
on that account? Some, in the apostles days, turned the Grace of GOD itself into wantonness or lasciviousness, (See Jude 4); and others pretended that those holy men encouraged sin, by proclaim∣ing salvation to sinners, through grace, or faith in Christ; of which St. Paul complains, (Rom. iii. 8.) 'We be slanderously reported, and some af∣firm that we say, Let us do evil, that good may come: whose damnation is just'—The holy apos∣tle abhorred, and constantly denied this horrid consequence, which some perverse minds pre∣tended to draw from his doctrine; he declared that the damnation of such was just, who did sin that grace might abound, or who affirmed that the doctrine led thereto, or that the apostles taught or practised any such things; nevertheless, (not as fools, but as wise) they did not think fit to lay the gospel aside, and refuse to preach salvation through CHRIST any more on that account: The self-same reasoning applies to the present case.</ITEM>

<P>I must confess that you have so far pre∣vailed as to silence this great objection; for cer∣tainly the belief of the Restoration feems by your account of it consistent with a state of grace, and the knowledge and practice of religion. But though you have obviated several objections, there is one you have not yet touched, which is very consi∣derable, and I am doubtful that it will be difficult if not impossible for you to answer fairly, it may be thus expressed, <HI>God has abounded towards us in all wisdom:</HI> one instance is his hanging out the threat∣enings of the severest punishments to prevent his creatures from sinning while in this world; but to tell them at the same time, that if they should sin he means to save them, is not <HI>prudent;</HI> because
<PB N="134" REF="025050_0190_102D76B3B09D3C78"/>
that lessens, if not destroys the force of his threat∣ening. He told Adam that if he did eat, he should surely die; but did not tell him (at the same time) that if he should eat, his case would not be remedi∣less; this were to take down with one hand what he had set up with the other. After the threaten∣ing failed of the effect, he told him so, and not be∣fore, this was prudently done; so after his threat∣enings fail of effect in this state, is the time to re∣veal his design of saving daring sinners. We may therefore be sure that he has not done it yet, and that we misconstrue those texts which seem to con∣tain such a revelation. The next state is the only state to preach the doctrine, and reveal the doc∣trine. If you preach it here, it will be unneces∣sary to preach it in hell; for obstinate sinners will carry it in their heads thither.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>As specious and plausible as this ob∣jection seems, I doubt not of being able to answer it fairly, without evading the natural force of it in the least. The first thing that I shall notice in this objection, is the very different and contrary man∣ner in which you apply those words of the apostle from his first evident intention. <HI>He hath abounded towards us in all wisdom and prudence, having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the fulness of times, he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are in Heaven, and which are on earth, even in him.</HI> Ephes. i. 8, 9, 10. God hath judged it be the height of heavenly wisdom and prudence to make known to his saints, his glorious purpose, finally to rehead all things in Christ; and we ought not to presume to be more wise and prudent than he.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="025050_0191_102D76E2CCAC1078"/>
There is no doubt but God hath revealed this great truth more immediately to his saints and faithful ones for their consolation, than for the be∣nefit of the finally impenitent.</P>
<P>It is of amazing, I had almost said of infinite use to the people of God, to have this divine coun∣sel declared to them in the present time. The knowledge of this truth entirely removes all hard thoughts of God from the minds of those who re∣ceive it, as I can testify by experience; for since I have believed in the doctrine of the universal Re∣storation, I have never had one hard thought of God abiding for one minute in my mind, that I re∣member, and never expect to have any more while I continue to believe it firmly.</P>
<P>The belief of the Restoration is of great use in supporting good people under their sorrows and trials here; the idea that evil shall be destroyed, and all things restored to their primitive glory is the most consolatory of all other ideas. As this doctrine tends to remove the greatest difficulties from the plan of Providence, and also from di∣vine Revelation, it is evident that the knowledge of it must be of the greatest use to all that love their great Creator. And therefore if the reve∣lation of it answered no other purpose in this life, but for the happiness, joy, and satisfaction of such as love God, we might be sure that he hath made it known, and that we rightly understand those passages that hold it forth; for since 'the se∣cret of the Lord is with them that fear him, and he will shew them his covenant,' Psal. xxv. 14. and 'The Lord God will do nothing, but he re∣vealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets,' Amos iii. 7. there is all the reason to conclude,
<PB N="136" REF="025050_0192_102D76B5C59CA928"/>
that if God ever intended to restore mankind hereafter, he would not fail to reveal it to his chosen and faithful servants. And this he hath done, if I can understand the meaning of words.</P>
<P>It is true that God did not inform our first pa∣rents before they sinned that he had provided a remedy; but not long did he delay after the fall to reveal to them, that the seed of the woman should bruise the serpent's head, Gen. iii. 15. and this one text contains in miniature all that I believe respecting the Restoration of mankind; for if the Serpent's head is finally to be bruised, his power and influence over mankind, must be entirely de∣stroyed; and then what shall prevent their return to God?</P>
<P>Besides, it is impossible to read the Scriptures attentively, and not perceive that God very fre∣quently mixes promises of mercies among his se∣verest threatenings of judgment; and yet he doth not throw down with one hand, what he builds up with the other.</P>
<P>Your object seems to suppose that the doctrine of the Restoration supersedes and sets aside those punishments which God has threatened to inflict upon the impenitent; or else how does the preach∣ing of this doctrine weaken the force of the threat∣enings? But this is a very false idea; for we ac∣knowledge that the threatenings shall be fulfilled, and not that the disobedient shall escape unpunshed. There is a great deal of difference between these two ideas, though you would intimate them to be the same, and that we contradict God by assuring the wicked that they shall escape the just judgment of God. But we only declare that an end shall finally come to their punishment, and that when
<PB N="137" REF="025050_0193_102D703517879EE0"/>
they shall be sufficiently humbled a dispensation of mercy shall succeed that of judgment. Let me ask you, Has not God threatened mankind with death on the account of sin? 'Dust thou art, and unto dust thou shalt return.' Gen. iii. 19. Well, tell me, is this threatening either weakened or de∣stroyed by the knowledge of the great doctrine of the resurrection of the dead? Did not God threaten the children of Israel with dreadful judgments to prevent their sinning, and that they should be dispersed among all nations? but will you say that he either weakened or distroyed the force of his threatenings, because he promised them at the same time that at last he would return their captivity, and restore them as at the first, and do better unto them, than at their beginning.</P>
<P>The laws of this country condemn criminals to death: would it be thought that I should weak∣en or destroy the force of the penal statutes, by saying, that the execution of the law could only be felt for a certain time, beyond which it could not endure? Is not every malefactor under the sen∣tence of death supposed to know this? and yet will any presume to say, that these laws are entire∣ly weakened, and their force destroyed because they do not condemn transgressors to endless pu∣nishments? But, if it be allowed that torments, which are but momentary, have a considerable in∣fluence in restraining many vices, there cannot be the smallest reason to fear that the doctrine of just retribution according to the deeds done in the bo∣dy, will open the door to vice and immorality, but on the contrary. But this objection is so near a kin to the last which you proposed, that it hard∣ly deserves a distinct consideration; for if the
<PB N="138" REF="025050_0194_102D76B755DA2D60"/>
doctrine of the Restoration does not lead men to commit sin, (as I am sure it has no such tendency) then no harm can be apprehended from its being known in this state. And whereas you argue, that as it would not be proper for the present state, we may be sure that God hath not revealed it; and therefore is highly proper for men to know in the present state. You will please therefore to no∣tice that the universal doctrine, so far from tend∣ing to render the divine threatenings useless or vain, weakening their force, or setting them aside, operates in the direct contrary manner. I as much believe as you or any other man can do, that all the threatenings will be fulfilled upon the finally impenitent; but dare not carry the matter so far as to set aside the gracious promises of God, with which the Scriptures appear to me to abound, in favour of the final recovery of all at last.</P>

<P>It must I think be confessed that if the doctrine of the Restoration be true, it would be matter of great joy and comfort for good men to know it, for they have often great trouble and anxiety of mind on the account of their families, friends, neighbours, acquaintance, and mankind in general; which sorrow would be greatly reliev∣ed, could they have an idea of the Restoration of all things in the manner you hold it. But however true this may be, it seems not to be plain∣ly revealed in the Scripture, otherwise it would not be hidden from the eyes of so many great and good men.</P>

<P>It is possible, that a subject may be re∣vealed in the plainest manner, and yet the best of men may remain ignorant of it. For instance, were not the sufferings, death, and resurrection of our
<PB N="139" REF="025050_0195_102D76E4DA4F9C68"/>
Lord plainly revealed in the Scriptures of the old Testament? And yet we know that the apostles of our Saviour did not understand one of those prophecies. Nay, when Jesus told them openly and expressly that he must be delivered into the hands of men, and that they should mock, scourge, and crucify him, and that the third day he should rise again, they did not comprehend his meaning; although he spoke to them frequently and very plainly upon the subject, and said, 'Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men. But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not; and they feared to ask him of that saying.' St. Luke ix. 44, 45. And in another place we read, 'For he taught his disciples, and said unto them, The Son of man is delivered into the hands of men, and they shall kill him: and after that he is killed, he shall rise the third day.' It is impossible that words should be more express, or less liable to be mis∣understood. 'But (as the evangelist immediately informs us) 'they understood not that saying, and were afraid to ask him.' St. Mark ix. 31, 32. And in the same chapter we find, that after our Lord Jesus was transfigured upon the mount, in the presence of Peter, James, and John, 'As they came down from the mountain, he charged them that they should tell no man what things they had seen, till the Son of man were risen from the dead. And they kept that saying with them∣selves, questioning one with another what the ris∣ing from the dead should mean.' Ver. 9, 10. This was what Christ taught them not only plainly, but also frequently. See St. Matt. xvi. 21. xvii. 9,
<PB N="140" REF="025050_0196_102D76B989314968"/>
22, 23. xx. 17, 18, 19. xxvi. 31, 32. St. Mark viii. 31. ix. 9, 10, 31, 32. X. 32, 33, 34. xiv. 27, 28. St. Luke ix. 21, 22, 44, 45. xviii. 31, 32, 33, 34.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding the plainness and frequen∣cy of these predictions, and the pains which Christ took to instil these ideas into them, they never un∣derstood them at all until sometime after they were fulfilled. For when they saw him taken and de∣livered into the hands of men, and treated exactly according to his own words often repeated, they were entirely disappointed, and all their hopes seemed to die within them. And when he was risen from the dead, they would not believe the testimo∣ny of those who had seen him, and would hardly trust their own senses, so ignorant were they of what he had told them.</P>
<P>St. John was the first of the disciples who be∣lieved that he was risen, for thus he writes 'Then went in also that other disciple, who came first to the sepulchre, and he saw and believed. For as yet they knew not the Scripture that he must rise again from the dead.' Sr. John xx. 8, 9. This instance is so much to my purpose, and proves so evidently that a thing may be plainly revealed, and expressed in the clearest manner, and yet not be understood; that I hardly need mention any more. But I will mention another, and that is, the calling of the Gentiles. This was spoken of by the pro∣phets, in the clearest language; and Jesus after his resurrection gave a full commission to his apos∣tles, which one would think it was impossible for them to misunderstand.</P>
<P>'All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth, Go ye therefore and teach all nations,' &amp;c.
<PB N="141" REF="025050_0197_102D76E6A10A0DB8"/>
St. Matt. xxviii. 18, 19. 'Go ye unto all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.' St. Mark xvi. 15.</P>
<P>'Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead on the third day: and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. And ye are witnesses of these things.' St. Luke xxiv. 46, 47, 48. 'Ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Judea and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.' Acts i. 8. But the apostles them∣selves, even after the miraculous descent of the Holy Ghost upon them, were without understand∣ing, respecting the calling of the Gentiles, until St. Peter was taught it by a vision from heaven. See Acts x.</P>
<P>And St. Paul speaks of this subject as a myste∣ry that was hid from ages and generations, and particularly revealed to him, and to the saints in that day. See Ephes. iii. 1—11. Col. i. 25, 26, 27.</P>
<P>Wherefore, when I consider that the apostles themselves could not for a time see those things to be revealed, which yet were most plainly, fully, and frequently told them, I cannot wonder that many great and good men now should not see the general Redemption and final Restoration of all things plainly revealed in the Scriptures, though to me scarce any subject appears more evident. It gives me now but little concern to hear many say, that they cannot see the matter plainly declared in the Bible, since I know that things have been there that wise and good men could not see; and
<PB N="142" REF="025050_0198_102D76BB17259538"/>
what has happened in times past may take place now: and if I can see for myself, this great truth made known, it is enough for me. I am not to enquire, What does this man believe? Or, What shall the other do? I must believe what the Scripture appears to me to teach, and do what I am there commanded, let others believe or do as they may.</P>

<P>But I have heard some say of you, 'How comes this man to know more than all the world? Have there not been many great, wise, and good men in all ages, that have never thought of these things? If this doctrine of the final Restoration of all things had been true, surely our wise, good, and learned ministers would have discovered it, and proclaimed it long ago. But the doctrine of end∣less misery is a point in which they seem generally to agree, however they differ in other matters, and therefore it must be true, and this doctrine of the general Restoration, which this man holds up, al∣most alone, must be false.'</P>

<P>I am very far from pretending to be wiser than any that have gone before me; and as for this doctrine of the Restoration it was not only believed and preached by the apostles, but many of the ancient fathers who liveth in the first ages of Christianity, were bold witnesses for this glori∣ous truth. It is true that when the Church of Rome rose to supreme power, the Popes and Coun∣cils endeavoured to extirpate the <HI>merciful doctors</HI> (as those who believed the general Restoration, were called in derision) and their adherents, but it was not until near the close of the seventh cen∣tury, that they were able to silence the witnesses for this truth. This, (as well as many other pre∣cious
<PB N="143" REF="025050_0199_102D76E897E9FA90"/>
truths) then lay hid until the reformation, when it began a little to revive, and hath gradually increased ever since. Several great authors have written upon it; many hundreds, and even thou∣sands have believed it, and found comfort and joy therein. Nay, there are many ministers who be∣lieve it now as firmly as I do, but do not chuse to confess or preach it, for various reasons; and great numbers of private christians enjoy the com∣fort and happiness of believing it secretly. But put the case that I stood alone in this testimony, yet if upon a fair examination, the Scriptures hold forth this idea, and if all objections against it may be fully answered; why should my testimony be refused on the account of its singularity? God has an absolute right to use what means or instruments he pleases, to manifest his truth, and to fulfil his purposes; and though I am nothing, and in his sight am less than nothing, yet he is able by the things that are not, to confound and bring to nought the things that are, that no flesh should glory in his presence. 1 Cor. i. 28, 29.</P>
<P>I acknowledge that the generality of ministers in the present day profess to believe endless misery, though they disagree in other points; and indeed one reason why they fall out so much about other doctrines, is, because they receive this as a first principle, as is very obvious; for were those who believe that Christ died only for a part of mankind, once to give up the idea of endless misery, they would acknowledge the universality of the love of God, and confess that Jesus died for all in the fullest sense. And on the other hand, if those who believe in general redemption, were not so exceed∣ingly tenacious of the doctrine of endless misery,
<PB N="144" REF="025050_0200_102D73A2213EDD40"/>
they would not oppose the doctrine of election, nor hold that the will of God might be finally frustrated, and that the death of Christ shall be in vain, with respect to many, and that many ob∣jects of the divine love shall finally perish to all eternity. These inconsistencies in their sentiments, and the contests between them and those who hold partial redemption and salvation, are therefore chiefly, if not wholly owing to both parties being agreed in this most dreadful doctrine of endless misery.</P>
<P>It is beautiful to observe the progression of the glorious gospel, from its opening to our first pa∣rents in the garden down to the present day. I have sometimes mentioned, in public, that the more the gospel is known and revealed, the larger and richer it appears.</P>
<P>It first seemed confined to one family or nation, but later discoveries shewed that all nations had a part therein, and all sorts of people were designed to share in its blessings: now the glorious news begins to be published abroad, not only that all nations, and all sorts of people, but all persons and individuals, without exception, not only <HI>may</HI> par∣take of its benefits, but <HI>shall</HI> in due time enjoy great advantages thereby.</P>
<P>God always adapts his remedies to the evils that prevail in the world; and therefore he hath opened his counsels to men according to their dif∣ferent capacities, needs, and circumstances. Christi∣anity might, formerly, have been received and sin∣cerely practised, without being investigated at all; but when infidelity rises up and attacks it, as it does in this our age, it becomes the duty of its friends to defend it, by enquiring into its meaning; and
<PB N="145" REF="025050_0201_102D74D791B0A7F0"/>
laying all prejudices aside, to receive as truth those things which God hath revealed, and the same to vindicate before the world.</P>
<P>It might not formerly have been necessary to un∣derstand all the prophecies; and yet now, as the time of their fulfilment draws nigh, they may be∣come more important, be more studied, and better understood; and for this purpose, God may actu∣ally illuminate the minds of some, to set them forth in a more national, scriptural, consistent man∣ner than they have appeared in hitherto. And if it should please God to make any use of my tongue or pen for this great purpose, the glory shall be all ascribed to his name, to whom alone it is due; I shall have nothing to glory or boast of, forasmuch as I can only communicate what I receive; and I hope none will refuse to receive the truth, however weak or unworthy the instrument by which God may please to send it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>If this is the truth which you hold forth, however contrary to the commonly receiv∣ed opinions of the age, I see no reason why men should refuse to hear what you have to say; but I have heard many exclaim against you in the se∣verest manner: and declare that they would not hear you, nor read your writings on any account: and others have said, that they could confute and overthrow your whole system in ten minutes, but whether they would be able to make their words good if they should enter the lists with you is another matter, and cannot be determined till a fair trial.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can assure yon my friend that I should not have the least objection to their making the attempt; for though I am conscious that nei∣ther
<PB N="146" REF="025050_0202_102D73A3E7A29B40"/>
my natural nor acquired abilities, are worthy to be compared to those of many excellent charac∣ters who hold the contrary sentiments: yet the goodness of the cause in which I am engaged, in∣spires me with courage to attempt its vindication, let who will enter the lists with me. For when the evidence of this most glorious truth first be∣gan to appear to my mind, I was determined never to believe or profess it, until I could answer every objection that could be brought from the Scrip∣tures against it, fairly, and without any torturing or twisting the words of truth; and it pleased God so to open matters to my view, as to take every objection out of my mind, and to clear up every doubt, in such a manner, that I have full satisfaction: And I can safely say, in the fear of God, that I am so far from being offended with those who question me upon the matter, and there∣by give me an opportunity of answering for my∣self, that I take it as an act of kindness; and as I stand ready to be reproved wherein I am out of the way, so I shall thank the person who, in the spirit of love, convinces me of error: 'Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let them reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not break my head.' But let not the man who would write, dip his pen in gall; nor he that would converse, make his tongue as a sharp sword: but 'Let all bitterness, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice; and be ye kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, hath for∣given you. Put on, therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kind∣ness,
<PB N="147" REF="025050_0203_102D711BA5816CD8"/>
humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering; forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel against any; even as Christ forgave you, so also do ye. And, above all things, put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness, And let the peace of God rule in your hearts.' These are the tempers of mind we ought always to possess; and especially, when we dis∣course upon the great things of the kingdom of God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have the same desires that you express; and I think it is to the shame of human nature, and a reproach to the innocent cause of Christianity, that religious disputes have been carried on with such amazing bitterness and acrimony. Men seem frequently to forget that they are brethren; and that they must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ. If they remembered these things, as they ought, they would not revile, censure, judge, and condemn each other, as they do: From which evil practices may the good Lord preserve us, while we debate this very important subject; for though I am determined to urge every thing that I can with propriety, in the strongest manner that I am able, yet I am willing to stipulate on my part, that if I should use any reproachful or censorious lan∣guage in the remainder of the debate, I will give you leave to consider it as totally giving up the cause in which I am engaged.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>And I hereby promise the same: for I am determined never to write a page of controver∣sy, unless it can be written in the very spirit of love and true benevolence, with a sincere desire to find and embrace the truth.</P>
<P><PB N="148" REF="025050_0204_102D73A8C5CDCF30"/>
The want of this in most controversial writers, has made serious people so weary of controversy, that they will neither read nor hear it on any ac∣count: nor can I wonder at it, for such bitter∣ness tends entirely to root out the spirit of true religion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I hope we shall shew an example to man∣kind, how disputes ought to be carried on: in love, and in the fear of God, and for the purpose of mutual edification. But as our present discourse has been long and very important, I will take my leave of you for this time, hoping at a future op∣portunity to have more conversation with you on this so interesting a subject.</P>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I AM happy to have another opportu∣nity of discoursing with you, concern∣ing that point in which you differ from your bre∣thren, the final Restoration of all things. I have thought much of the subject since I saw you; and though I must acknowledge, that you have answer∣ed, as far as I can see, some of the greatest objec∣tions that I have found in the Scriptures; yet a considerable number remain to be answered, before I can venture to receive as a truth, what I have hi∣therto looked upon as a <HI>dangerous heresy;</HI> and as I have many questions to propose, I wish to make the best use of my time.</P>

<P>CHRIST threatens the <HI>Jews</HI> with an eter∣nal exclusion from his presence: 'Ye shall seek me, and shall not find me; and where I am, thi∣ther ye cannot come,' St. John vii. 34. Then said JESUS again unto them, I go my way, and ye shall seek me, and shall die in your sins: whither I go, ye cannot come. Ye are from beneath, I am from above: ye are of this world, I am not of this world. I said therefore unto you, That ye
<PB N="150" REF="025050_0206_102D73AA96DCF760"/>
shall die in your sins: for if ye believe not that I am he, ye shall die in your sins,' St. John viii. 21, 23, 24.</P>

<P>Do you recollect that our LORD uses words nearly similar to some of these, to his own disciples?</P>

<P>I am surprized that I should never have observed this before—Let me read the passage— Oh! but stop—it is explained in the 36th verse: 'Simon Peter said unto him, LORD, whither goest thou? JESUS answered him, Whither I go, thou canst not follow me now; but thou shalt follow me afterwards.' But nothing of the kind is inti∣mated respecting the <HI>Jews.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Not in that text, I confess; but in ma∣ny others it is more than intimated, that they shall come to know and love him, yea, and to behold him as their friend. I think, it is intimated in those words which our Saviour used, in the close of his threatenings to Jerusalem:—'Behold, your house is left unto you desolate: and verily I say unto you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, until the time come when ye shall say, Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the LORD,' St. Matth.
<PB N="151" REF="025050_0207_102D711F033CB858"/>
xxiii. 38, 39. St. Luke xiii. 35. It is more than intimated in these words—'And so <HI>all Israel</HI> shall be saved. For GOD hath concluded them all in un∣belief, that he might have mercy upon all,' Rom. xi. 26, 32. 'In JEHOVAH shall <HI>all</HI> the seed of <HI>Is∣rael</HI> be justified, and shall glory,' Isai. xlv. 25. 'I will call them My people, who were not my peo∣ple; and her Beloved, that was not beloved. And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there shall they be called, The children of the living God,' Rom. ix. 25, 26. 'Now will I bring again the captivity of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and have mercy upon the <HI>whole</HI> house of <HI>Israel:</HI> I have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of them,' Ezek. xxxix. 25, 28. 'And I will multiply men upon you, (the mountains of Israel) <HI>all</HI> the House of <HI>Israel</HI> even <HI>all</HI> of it,' xxxvi. 10. 'Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to come up out of your graves, and bring you in∣to the land of Israel. And ye shall know that I am JEHOVAH, when I have opened your graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves, and shall put my Spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I, JEHOVAH, have spoken it, and performed it, saith JEHOVAH,' chap. xxxvii. 12, 13, 14.</P>

<P>But this returning from captivity, can only respect such as are alive at that period, when the LORD shall set his hand the second time to recover the remnant of his people from Assy∣ria, &amp;c.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is more than any one can prove: as the expression is sometimes used evidently for
<PB N="152" REF="025050_0208_102D73AC780A2D18"/>
the Restoration of such whose bodies are destroy∣ed, beyond dispute; as, in the case of <HI>Sodom</HI> and her daughters, who were taken away, by fire and brimstone from heaven, whose captivity GOD pro∣mises to return, together with the captivity of <HI>Sa∣maria,</HI> and her daughters, at the same time that he will bring again the captivity of <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> and her daughters, in the midst of them. See Ezek. xvi. 44—63; especially, verses 53, 55, 61.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But Mr. POOLE'S Continuators, as well as many other eminent divines, tell us, that these which you take to be promises, are only dreadful threatenings; and their meaning is this:—I never will bring again the captivity of <HI>Samaria,</HI> and her daughters; nor the captivity of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and her daughters; neither will I ever bring again the cap∣tivity of <HI>thy captives,</HI> in the midst of them: when <HI>Sodom</HI> and her daughters shall return to their form∣er estate, (which is impossible) and <HI>Samaria</HI> and her daughters shall return to their former estate, (which shall never be) then <HI>thou</HI> and thy daughters shall return to your former estate: but that time shall never come.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I know, such is their interpretation, which proves nothing more than the weakness of their cause; for in all this, they expressly contra∣dict GOD, who, from the 60th verse to the end of the chapter, promises blessings to Jerusalem in the most absolute manner; That he will remember the covenant made with her in the days of her youth, and will establish unto her an everlasting covenant; that she shall receive her sisters, <HI>Samaria</HI> and <HI>Sodom,</HI> (called her <HI>elder</HI> and her <HI>younger</HI> sis∣ters); and he promises to give them to her, for
<PB N="153" REF="025050_0209_102D71213B7367F8"/>
daughters; not by the first covenant, indeed, but by the new and everlasting covenant, which he will make in those days; then shall the covenant be firmly established with her; she shall know JE∣HOVAH; shall remember, and be confounded; and never shall open her mouth in pride any more, because of her former sin and shame, when GOD shall be pacified toward her, for all that she hath done.</P>
<P>How many promises has GOD made to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in the prophecies, of not only bringing her <HI>captivi∣ty,</HI> and returning her to her <HI>former estate;</HI> but even causing greater blessings than ever to come to her, and of doing <HI>better</HI> to her than in her <HI>beginning,</HI> making her an <HI>eternal excellency,</HI> a <HI>joy</HI> of <HI>many ge∣nerations,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>It is therefore very surprising, that men profes∣sing to believe the Bible, should dare be so bold as to deny these promises, and declare, that GOD will never bring <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to her former estate! They might, indeed, safely say, that the promises have not yet been fulfilled; but it is too bold to assert, That therefore they will never be accomplished. Were there no other text to prove the Restoration of the Jews who died in their sins, and indeed of the whole fallen race of Adam, I should judge this suf∣ficient;—'<HI>All</HI> that the <HI>Father giveth me, shall come to me;</HI> and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me. And this is the <HI>Father's</HI> will, which hath sent me, that of <HI>all</HI> which he hath given me, I should lose <HI>nothing;</HI> but should raise it up a∣gain at the last day,' St. John vi. 37, 38, 30. Here we find that <HI>Christ,</HI> our <HI>Lord,</HI> declares, not only
<PB N="154" REF="025050_0210_102D73AEB3463498"/>
that <HI>all</HI> that the <HI>Father giveth</HI> him <HI>shall come</HI> to him; but also, that they shall come in such a man∣ner, as in no wise to be <HI>cost out;</HI> and that such is the <HI>Father's</HI> will, that nothing of all which he hath given to the <HI>Son,</HI> should be lost, or missing, at that great day when he shall deliver up the kingdom to the <HI>Father,</HI> who did put all things under him; and as this is the will of that <HI>God who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will;</HI> and as <HI>Christ</HI> has undertaken the accomplishment of this will of the <HI>Father,</HI> it concludes absolutely and forcibly against the doctrine of <HI>endless misery,</HI> and <HI>annihila∣tion.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>It certainly does, with respect to all those whom the <HI>Father giveth,</HI> or hath given, to the <HI>Son;</HI> but to none else.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>That is all that I contend for: I ground the universal Restoration of all things, up∣on these two premises, which I call the <HI>major</HI> and the <HI>minor,</HI> 1. That <HI>all things</HI> are given to the <HI>Son,</HI> without exception: 2. That <HI>all</HI> that are <HI>given him, shall come to him,</HI> in such a manner as <HI>not to be cast out;</HI> and that none shall be missing, lost, or wholly destroyed, but shall be forth-coming, in that great day when <HI>Christ</HI> shall give up the king∣dom to the <HI>Father.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But can you prove your <HI>major?</HI> I am sensible that the <HI>minor</HI> has been the great founda∣tion upon which <HI>particular redemption,</HI> &amp;c. has been supported; but if the <HI>major</HI> can be proved, it will set the strongest weapons of those who hold <HI>partial decrees,</HI> &amp;c. directly against them, and will give another turn, to the argument.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I can prove the <HI>major</HI> by the same po∣sitive expressions as the <HI>minor,</HI> and by more passa∣ges
<PB N="155" REF="025050_0211_102D7123561B39B8"/>
of Scripture; and you shall judge for your∣self, whether I quote them fairly, and whether they can be invalidated by any arguments which will not, at the same time, invalidate the <HI>minor.</HI> I will set down the several texts at large, as they are of great importance.</P>
<P>St. Matth. x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 27. '<HI>All things</HI> are delivered un∣to me of my <HI>Father:</HI> and no man knoweth the <HI>Son</HI> but the <HI>Father:</HI> neither knoweth any man the <HI>Father,</HI> save the <HI>Son,</HI> and he to whomsoever the <HI>Son</HI> will reveal him.' The very same words are mentioned by St. Luke: See chap. x. 22.</P>
<P>But the most striking passages of this kind, are found in the gospel of St. John, chap. iii. 35. and xiii. 3. 'The <HI>Father</HI> loveth the <HI>Son,</HI> and hath gi∣ven <HI>all things</HI> into his hands. <HI>Jesus</HI> knowing that the <HI>Father</HI> had given <HI>all things</HI> into his hands, and that he was come from <HI>God,</HI> and went to <HI>God,</HI> &amp;c.'</P>
<P><HI>God</HI> hath moreover said to his <HI>Son,</HI> 'Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine in∣heritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession,' Psal. ii. 8.</P>
<P>Thus, <HI>all things</HI> are given to <HI>Christ,</HI> without ex∣ception. The <HI>major</HI> and <HI>minor</HI> being both proved from Scripture, we may venture to draw this con∣clusion:</P>
<P>If <HI>all things</HI> are given into the hands of <HI>Christ,</HI> by the <HI>Father;</HI> and all that the <HI>Father</HI> giveth, or hath given, shall come to <HI>Christ,</HI> in such a man∣ner as not to be cast out; then shall all men be re∣stored.</P>
<P>Here the whole Christian world may unite, with∣out either party being obliged to give up their fa∣vourite tenets: and while some strongly contend,
<PB N="156" REF="025050_0212_102D73B089AA4DE0"/>
and prove from Scripture, that <HI>all things</HI> are deli∣vered into the hands of <HI>Jesus▪</HI> let the others go on to prove, that <HI>all</HI> that the <HI>Father</HI> giveth, shall come in such a manner as no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be cast out: Thus shall the truth be promoted mutually and equally, by those who seem to contradict each other; but neither shall, in that case, contradict what our Lord hath said.</P>
<P>But as <HI>all things</HI> or <HI>all men,</HI> without exception, are given to <HI>Jesus,</HI> that he might restore, or bring them back to God, in his own way and time; so is he invested with <HI>all power,</HI> that he might be able to accomplish so great a work. <HI>Jesus spake,</HI> saying, '<HI>All power</HI> is given unto me, in Heaven and in earth,' St. Matth. xxviii. 18, 'For as the <HI>Father</HI> hath life in himself, so hath he given to the <HI>Son</HI> to have life in himself; and hath given him autho∣rity to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man,' St. John v. 26, 27. <HI>Jesus,</HI> or <HI>Lord,</HI> has power to quicken souls who are dead in tres∣passes and sins; See Ephes. ii. 1. He himself saith; 'Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> and they that hear, shall live, St. John v. 25. He hath power to raise all the dead that are in their graves; for he saith, 'Marvel not at this: for the hour is coming, in which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth: they that have done good, to the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, to the resurrection of damnation,' verse 29. But he has not only power to raise the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead, and quicken whom he will; to give rewards to them that love him, and to pass sentence of judg∣ment and condemnation upon his foes, and they

And this is life eternal, that they might know thee, the only true <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> whom thou hast sent,' St. John xvii. 2, 3. Here we see that his power over all flesh was given him for this grand purpose, that ultimately he might give eternal life; not only endless existence, but the knowledge of <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>Christ,</HI> to <HI>all</HI> that the <HI>Father</HI> hath gi∣ven him; which are all without exception.—This is the will of <HI>God,</HI> that of <HI>all</HI> which he hath given the <HI>Son,</HI> he should lose nothing; but should give eternal life, even the knowledge of <HI>God,</HI> which he alone can give, to all, without reserve, whom the <HI>Father</HI> hath given him; this is the will which <HI>Christ</HI> came to do, and this he hath power to per∣form.—Now, if he came purposely to do the will of <HI>God;</HI> and if it is the will of <HI>God,</HI> that of all that the <HI>Father</HI> hath given to the <HI>Son,</HI> he should lose nothing; but should bring all to himself, in such a manner as that they should not be cast out, and give them all eternal life; and if all, without

reserve, are given to him, and universal power and dominion are his, for this very purpose; if all these premises are true—as who can deny?—then nothing can be more evident than this con∣clusion, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>All shall be at last restored.</HI></P>
<P>'It is written in the prophets, (saith Jesus)—And they shall all be taught of <HI>God.</HI> Every man therefore, that hath heard, and hath learned of the <HI>Father,</HI> cometh unto me,' St. John vi. 45.—If <HI>all</HI> shall be taught of <HI>God;</HI> and <HI>all</HI> that are taught, shall come to <HI>Christ;</HI> and none that come to him shall be cast out or rejected; if all these premises are true (and, I think, they are fully proved); how very naturally the conclusion follows, <HI>viz.</HI> that all shall be finally brought home to <HI>God,</HI> be∣fore <HI>Christ</HI> shall resign the kingdom to the <HI>Father.</HI></P>
<P>Our blessed Lord is invested with power suffi∣cient to perform this work: It is the will of <HI>God</HI> that it should be done; <HI>Christ</HI> came into the world on purpose to begin, and lay a foundation for the same; he hath laid a sufficient foundation, by tast∣ing death for <HI>all;</HI> one died for <HI>all;</HI> he gave himself a ransom for <HI>all,</HI> to be testified in due time; and he seemed confident that he should be able to accom∣plish this <HI>will</HI> of the <HI>Father,</HI> when he said, 'And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw <HI>all</HI> unto me,' St. John xii. 32. He <HI>was</HI> lifted up from the earth, and therefore the IF is now no more; he will certainly draw all unto himself, and give eternal life, or the knowledge of <HI>God</HI> to all. <HI>He shall see of the travail of his soul, and be satisfied:</HI> And who can conceive how much it will take to satisfy the capacious soul of the <HI>Son of God,</HI> and especially after having borne such deadly pains for <HI>all?</HI> These passages, my friend, establish my mind

<P>I suppose you know the expositions that are given by the generality of expositors upon all these texts: and it is a fact that thousands and millions of great and good men have read them, many have preached from them, and yet never saw any thing like the universal Restoration contained in them; but if the doctrine be true, and be at all intended to be set forth in the Scriptures, I must suppose that the passages you have mentioned, may allude to it; but I have many objections yet to propose, which must be fairly answered before I can receive it.</P>

<P>What do you think of those passages, where GOD is represented as swearing in his wrath that unbelievers shall not enter into his rest, which are found in Psal. xcv. 11. Heb. iii. 11, 18, 19. Chap. iv. 3, 6, compared with Numb. xiv. Do

<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>By the <HI>rest</HI> that was promised to the children of Isreal, which they forfeited by their un∣belief, we must understand the land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and not the final state of happiness. For who can sup∣pose, that out of more than six hundred thousand men, besides women, only two will be saved?—and that even <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aints of the Lord, will be lost among the rest? For they, as well as others, entered not in; because they be∣lieved not God, to sanctify him before the congre∣gation: (See Numb. xx. 12.) Only <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>b</HI> and <HI>Jo∣shua</HI> entered into that <HI>rest,</HI> for they followed the <HI>Lord</HI> fully: and they are typical of those who shall follow the Lamb in all ages, so as to obtain a part in the <HI>first resurrection,</HI> over whom the second death shall have no power: they who are <HI>called,</HI> and <HI>chosen,</HI> and <HI>faithful,</HI> and are <HI>overcomers,</HI> shall reign with <HI>Christ</HI> on earth during the <HI>Millenium,</HI> which is the <HI>rest</HI> that was pointed out by the land of <HI>Canaan.</HI></P>
</SP>

<P>Is it, indeed? We have commonly understood that <HI>rest</HI> which the children of Israel had in the promised land, as typical of Heaven and eternal felicity.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>This cannot be; since it is evident that mighty wars were waged, and dreadful battles fought, thirty-one kings and kingdoms were con∣quered and subdued by Joshua and the Israelites, after they passed over Jordan; it was not a perfect <HI>rest,</HI> but only a type of that keeping of the sabbath which remains for the people of GOD, into which we are exhorted to enter; which is the time when our <HI>Lord,</HI> after having conquered the nations of
<PB N="161" REF="025050_0217_102D712C267FC620"/>
the earth, shall reign for a <HI>thousand years,</HI> before the second resurrection; but as many of the Israelites may be saved in the day of the Lord, whose carca∣ses fell in the wilderness; so, likewise, shall the names of many be found in the book of life, at the general judgment, when the dead, small and great, shall stand before GOD, who were not worthy to have a part in the first resurrection. These passages, therefore, conclude strongly against <HI>those</HI> having a a part in the first resurrection; but nothing against the final Restoration, which is a state far beyond, and belongs to another dispensation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is quite a different comment from what I have ever heard before; but allowing this objection to be answered, I have another in my mind, that appears very difficult, and I should be glad to know what you can say upon it; it is drawn from Isaiah xxvii. 11. 'For it is a people of no understanding; therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no favour.' How can they ever be restored, if GOD will not have mercy upon them, nor shew them any favour?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>If we did not understand these words with some limitation, it would be as difficult to re∣concile them with other passages of Scripture, as with the doctrine of the Restoration; but if we only limit the time, all is easy; 'He shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no mercy;' nevertheless it is added, 'but mercy re∣joiceth against judgment,' James ii. 13. The way I answer all these threatenings, and shew them to be consistent with that boundless mercy of GOD, that is over all his works, is, to shew, that both wrath and mercy have their season; that <HI>anger en∣dureth</HI>
<PB N="162" REF="025050_0218_102D73FCA34F1FA0"/>
but a <HI>moment,</HI> but that <HI>mercy endureth for ever;</HI> which glorious declaration is expressed more than forty times in the Scripture; and that God frequently threatens the greatest judgments, and promiseth the greatest mercies, to the same people and persons. 'Thus saith JEHOVAH, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous. There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. All thy lovers have forgotten thee: they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisement of a cruel one, for the multitude of thine iniquity; because thy sins were increased. Why criest thou for thine affliction? Thy sorrow is incurable, for the mul∣titude of thine iniquity: because thy sins were in∣creased, I have done these things unto thee.' Now, who would not think, from reading these words, that these people were in a most hopeless state, beyond the reach of mercy; and that it was in vain for them even to seek it?—And yet the ve∣ry next words speak a language directly contrary. 'Therefore all they that devour thee, shall be de∣voured, &amp;c. For I will restore health unto thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith JEHO∣VAH; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is <HI>Zion,</HI> whom no man seeketh after.' See Jer. xxx. 12—17. I could justify this observa∣tion by hundreds of passages wherein GOD threat∣ens his people with judgments the most severe, and declares—that his eye shall not pity, nor his arm save; that he will visit their transgressions upon them, will utterly cast them off, and will not have compassion on them at all; and then such promises of mercy break out as are sufficient to a∣stonish
<PB N="163" REF="025050_0219_102D712DD883C1C0"/>
every one with their greatness. But time would fail to quote them at large. GOD, by Ho∣sea, says, 'I will no more have mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them away. For ye are not my people, and I will not be your God.' And then immediately says, speaking of a time to come, 'And it shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them, 'Ye are the sons of the living GOD.' See Hosea, i. 6, 9, 10.</P>
<P>The whole prophecy, indeed, seems of a piece with this specimen. In the second chapter it is said, 'Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband; and I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the children of whoredoms.' Then he goes on to pronounce many dreadful threatenings; but the chapter closes with the most amazing promises of mercies to the same people, under the similitude of a wife that had been rejected, and after a long time received again. 'And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in lov∣ing-kindness, and in mercies. I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness, and thou shalt know the <HI>Lord.</HI> And I will sow her unto me in the earth, and I will have mercy upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them who were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall say, Thou art my GOD;' See Hos. ii. 2, 4, 19, 20, 23. Thus the objection admits of a fair and rational answer; and I have been the larger upon it, because I judged it of great importance to clear it up thoroughly: but more passages upon
<PB N="164" REF="025050_0220_102D73FE9B2C6BC0"/>
this subject are needless, or I could easily produce great numbers, that speak to the same purpose.</P>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>You have seemed to come over this ob∣jection rather better than I could have expected, but I must beg leave to ask you, What you do with that passage: (Psalms x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>x. 19.) 'He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never see light?'</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I render the words <HI>gnad natzah,</HI> 'un∣til subdued and overcome, they shall not see the light; <HI>or,</HI> 'until the age, or a certain period, they shall not see the light.' The same words are used in Job xxxiv. 36, where they are rendered <HI>'unto the end.'</HI> 'My desire is, that Job may be tried unto the end. How would it seem to render the words thus—'My desire is, that Job may be tried <HI>never; or,</HI> may <HI>never</HI> be tried?' This would be quite inconsistent with the nature of things, as well as a contradiction in the words themselves; For first to say, 'My desire is, that Job may be tried,' and then to add words that mean <HI>never,</HI> is quite ridiculous even to suppose; but render the words, <HI>unto a time</HI> or <HI>period,</HI>' or as they will bear, '<HI>until he be subdued</HI> or <HI>overcome,</HI>' and the meaning is both plain and benevolent: but to wish him tri∣ed <HI>for ever,</HI> world without end, would be a most malevolent wish, —and to wish him tried <HI>never,</HI> would be nonsense.</P>

<P>The word <HI>never</HI> is sometimes used in our translation, in such a manner as to oblige us

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must allow that the words you men∣tion seem very strong and absolute, but the very reason of things obliges us to limit their meaning to a period or age; but where no such necessity appears we must understand such words in the most absolute and unlimited sense.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I think there is as abundant reason from Scripture to limit the time of punishment as any thing whatever; as I trust will appear in the course of our conversation, for which purpose I shall be glad to hear all that you are able to urge against the doctrine of the Restoration.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>The next objection I shall bring is from Job xxxvi. 18. 'Because there is wrath, beware left he take thee away with his stroke; then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.' By which we understand, that after death there is no deliver∣ance, no, not even by that <HI>great ransom</HI> the blood of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>This would be one of the strongest ob∣jections that you have yet advanced, if the words a <HI>great ransom,</HI> had any allusion to the blood of the dear <HI>Redeemer,</HI> and if it could be fairly demonstra∣ted, that it can have no power over the dead; but I apprehend, when you read and consider the text, context, and similar passages, you will see that no such thing is intended.</P>
<P><HI>Job</HI> had frequently wished for death in his trou∣ble and anguish, (as many persons foolishly and wickedly do, that have never felt the tenth part of his afflictions) for which <HI>Elihu</HI> justly reproves him, in these words; 'Because there is wrath, be∣ware
<PB N="166" REF="025050_0222_102D749621725120"/>
lest he take thee away with his stroke; then a great ransom cannot deliver thee,' from death and the grave; from being cut off by the hand of Heaven, justly provoked by thy rashness: 'Will he esteem thy riches?' Will he account thy great riches a ransom for thy life? 'No not gold, nor all the forces of strength:' Wouldest thou give ever so much of the precious ore to ransom thy life, it would be unavailable; or, shouldest thou trust in thy strength of body or mind; shouldest thou plead the readiness of thy wit, the strength and greatness of thy judgment, memory, and other faculties; thy benevolence of disposition; thy usefulness in life, thy numerous connections, the great honours that await thee; wert thou a monarch, and couldest thou command armies and valiant hosts, strong and mighty; all these things would be totally disregarded by God, if he, pro∣voked by thy rashness, should give thee thy wish, and issue the <HI>death warrant</HI> against thy life: there∣fore, considering these things, 'Desire not the night (of death and especially sudden death) when people are cut off in their place,' and there is no remedy, no ransom, no discharge in that war; from which neither power, wisdom, might, riches, honours, wickedness, nor even virtue, can deliver. 'Take heed, regard not iniquity;' do not sin in any wise, and especially do not rashly wish for death; which is very presumptuous and heaven daring; 'for this thou hast chosen, rather than affliction:' See Job xxxvi. 18, 19, 20, 21. This is evident∣ly the plain meaning of the text, and is confirmed by Psal. xlix. 6, 7, 8, 9. 'They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the multi∣tude of their riches; none of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to God a ran∣som
<PB N="167" REF="025050_0223_102D7131307E3AF8"/>
for him: (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth for ever.) That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.' But, though the power of wealth, wisdom, and strength, are not sufficient to buy a short reprieve from death; yet the power of GOD is able to ransom therefrom, and to redeem from the grave, or hell, as I have noticed before; and which is expressed in the last-mentioned Psalm, in the following terms; 'But GOD will redeem my soul from the power of the grave; for he shall receive me,' ver. 15. And by the same parity of reasoning, that the power of the HIGHEST is able also to redeem or ransom, the bodies of men from the grave, af∣ter they have perished there: he is able also to redeem souls from sin and misery, if it be his pleasure; and, by the blood of the MESSIAH'S, covenant, to send sorth his prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water, not even a drop to cool the tongues of those who are tormented there. I have therefore no doubt, but, the blood of <HI>Christ</HI> is able to redeem to the uttermost, and is sufficient to destroy the power of sin, death, and hell. No∣thing in the text on which your objection is found∣ed, can depreciate the merit of that cleansing, all-powerful blood, by proving that it cannot be ef∣fectual to lost souls.</P>

<P>But have you forgot that the Scripture says, 'Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might. for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest. And if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the north; in the place where the tree fall<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, there it shall be?'

<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>No; I have not forgot that such pas∣sages are found in the Bible; and I believe they were written with a design to make us diligent, and wisely to improve our time and talents; and that we should be liberal in giving alms, which seems especially to be the meaning of the last, if we may judge by the connection in which it is found, and without which I am not able to say what it in∣tends: But, in this case, they do not appear to me to be any thing to the purpose, one way or the other; and yet no Scriptures are more frequently brought than these against the doctrine of the Re∣storation of all things; but commonly accompani∣ed with some additions; such as—'There is no repentance in the grave; Nor pardon offered to the dead.'—'And as death leaves us, so judgment finds us.'—Words that I have never found in the Bible; but were they repeated ever so often, could not affect this argument; since the general Restora∣tion cannot happen till long after the last Judg∣ment, and will not be wholly comple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ted till the time of the creation of the new heavens and earth, wherein righteousness alone shall dwell.</P>
<P>We all know, that the grave is a place of inac∣tivity, where there is no <HI>work, devi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, knowledge,</HI> nor <HI>wisdom;</HI> and it is a state to which we shall soon be brought; and, therefore, we ought to be dili∣gent and industrious now: But those who believe in the immortality of the <HI>soul,</HI> will not undertake to prove from these words, that it has no <HI>knowledge,</HI> or <HI>wisdom,</HI> after it leaves the body; since many of them say, that the soul knows much more in one hour after that event takes place, than in the whole period of its existence before. And as for those who believe that man dies <HI>wholly,</HI> and sleeps
<PB N="169" REF="025050_0225_102D71334C6658D0"/>
in the grave until the resurrection, they can never bring this text with any consistency against the fi∣nal Restoration of all men; because, let what will be the state of things in the grave, nothing can prevent our Saviour from raising all at last, and changing them finally for the better, if such be his pleasure. I might, therefore, just as well at∣tempt, from the vii. and xiv. chapters of Job, to prove, that there shall be <HI>no resurrection of the dead from their graves,</HI> notwithstanding the nu∣merous promises of that grand event; as any per∣son to prove, from these and similar passages, that <HI>all men shall not be finally restored;</HI> since what is said in those chapters seems ten times more against the <HI>former,</HI> than any thing that can be urged from these is against the <HI>latter.</HI> The doctrine of the general <HI>resurrection</HI> of the just and unjust; and a state of <HI>rewards</HI> for the former, and <HI>punishments</HI> for the latter, according to their works; and also the <HI>subjection, final reconciliation,</HI> and <HI>re-union of</HI> ALL <HI>things in</HI> CHRIST, are all expressly revealed, and are made the subject of prophecies, threaten∣ings, and promises; and are all truths, that cannot be overthrown by any reasonings, as they are plain∣ly declared by GOD himself.</P>
<P>The Scripture, in abundance of places, highly recommends liberality; and, in the most positive manner, assures the bounteous, that they shall be blessed: I need not recite passages to prove, what is so universally known and confessed. <HI>Solomon,</HI> therefore, having given many excellent precepts to direct us in other matters, comes to exhort us to be bountiful and liberal, in distributing to the necessities of others what GOD hath blessed us with∣al; saying, 'Cast thy bread upon the waters; for
<PB N="170" REF="025050_0226_102D7499E97A7FF0"/>
thou shalt find it after many days. Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest not what evil shall be upon the earth. If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or to∣ward the north; in the place where the tree fall∣eth, there it shall be.' Thereby intimating to us, that as certainly as these plain common observa∣tions are true, (than which nothing can be more so) shall they who bestow liberally upon the poor and needy, be rewarded; since GOD has promised, and he will perform: See, upon this subject, Deut. xv. 10, 11.—Psal. xli. 1, 2, 3, cxii.—Prov. xi. 24, 25, 26. xiv. 31. xix. 17. xxii. 9.—St. Matth. vi. 3, 4, x. 42.—St. Luke vi. 38. xii. 33. xiv. 12, 13, 14.—2 Cor. viii. 9.—1 Tim. vi. 17, 18, 19—and many other places.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> then goes on upon the same subject, and intimates to us, by two striking metaphors, that if we wait till no difficulties appear in our way to hinder us from performing our duty, we shall never reap the blessing; and after giving us to under∣stand that GOD has many secret ways of working, far above our comprehension, and can therefore bless and reward us in many ways out of our own sight, or the view of others, and yet no less cer∣tainly than children are conceived, nourished, and receive life in the womb, though we know not how; he comes to give us a warm and pressing exhortation, to be constant in doing good to all, according to our power; and to be so far from concluding that to be lost that we thus be∣stow, that we ought to consider alms as seed sown in a fruitful soil, and should, with pati∣ence, wait for the glorious harvest, when, through
<PB N="171" REF="025050_0227_102D713514330928"/>
the divine blessing, we may expect to reap an hun∣dred fold.</P>
<P>All this is plain and easy: But how any text in this beautiful chain, should ever have been thought to have any allusion to the state of souls departed, or brought as a proof that no alteration can take place after death, I cannot conceive. But, allow∣ing it to have any relation at all to a future state, it cannot then in the least disprove, that very ma∣terial changes may happen to souls in the spiritual world; since a tree cut down by its owner, lies not long in the same position in which it falls, but is applied to various uses, according to its fitness and his pleasure. But as this is nothing to the purpose, I think I have taken too much pains here already; and I should have said little or nothing upon this part of the objection, were it not con∣tinually urged, as though the whole controversy turned and terminated upon this allusion, than which, nothing seems farther from the meaning of the text; which, in its true sense, appears to be this—That as certainly as full clouds must empty themselves upon the terraqueous globe, and that every thing is <HI>what it is,</HI> and <HI>where it is,</HI> and no where else; and as a tree falling to the south, does not fall and lie to the north; and, <HI>vice versa,</HI> so, with the same certainty, shall liberality be blest and rewarded.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have nothing to object to what you have said upon the text; it appears natural. I formerly thought it intended, that as persons were laid in the grave, so they should rise, and that there could be no change after death; but I am fully convinced, that this belongs not to the subject. But there is another passage, in the book of Eccle∣siastes,
<PB N="172" REF="025050_0228_102D749BF429E5A8"/>
(chap, ix. 4, 5, 6.) that I should be glad to hear your opinion of:—'For to him that is joined to all the living, there is hope; for a living dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know, that they must die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also, their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished: neither have they any more a por∣tion for ever, in any thing that is done under the sun.'</P>

<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is evident that the wise man, in this and many other of his observations, only consider∣ed things with respect to the present life, without any regard to a future state. In this view, his de∣clarations are consistent with truth; but in no other. Let the following serve as a specimen:—'No man knoweth either love or hatred, by all that is before them. All things come alike to all; there is one event to the righteous and to the wick∣ed; to the good, and to the clean, and to the un∣clean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sa∣crificeth not; as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath,' ver. 1, 2.—Nothing could possibly be more false than these observations, applied to a future state, though they are generally true in this life; for if there are no future rewards and punishments, no state of retribution hereafter, there is an end to all re∣ligion.

GOD shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing; whether it be good, or whether it be evil, chap. xii. 13, 14.</P>
<P>Thus, it is plain, that a living dog is better (more useful in this world) than a dead lion; which is no longer capable of doing good or evil; that a man, when he dies, loses all hopes of en∣joyment in this life, and is rendered incapable of exercising the functions of it any longer; has no more a portion in any thing belonging thereto. Thus, in fine, all the observations that can be fairly made, upon this and similar passages, belong en∣tirely to the present state of things; and, there∣fore do not at all affect the argument, either one way or the other.</P>

<P>This is so plain, that nothing can be more so; but our <HI>Saviour's</HI> words (St. John ix, 4.) deserve a particular consideration:—'I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh, when no man can work:'—which is explained commonly of the night of death, when no more works can he wrought.</P>

<P>Our Lord was diligent in his labour; he constantly went about doing good; he was ne∣ver idle; he was in haste, till he had finished the work which his father had given him to do. In this he was—as in every thing else—a glorious pattern and example for us! And, O that we might follow him!—Now we may feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, be eyes to the blind, feet to the lame; may take in the stran∣ger, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elieve the distressed, visit the sick, the father∣less, widows, and prisoners in their affliction; may bury the dead,—and constantly perform works of benevolence and mercy, while we remain in this

state of our existence; which if we here neglect, we never can perform at all, and of consequence, never obtain the rewards which are promised to the obedient: but as it is not the state of rewards and punishments that we are now discoursing about, but a state beyond— even the Restoration of all things; neither is the dispute about what <HI>men</HI> can do after this life, but what GOD can do, or what he has purposed to do with and for them, in the ages to come, after the dreadful sentence is past; whether they shall be left under the same, <HI>while God exists;</HI> or whether they shall ever be restored; or whether they shall be annihilated: this, you know, is the state of the question: some hold the <HI>first,</HI> and others the <HI>last:</HI> but I am apt to think both these opinions are extremes, and therefore judge it safest to maintain the <HI>second,</HI> which I take to be the medium here.</P>

<P>Indeed I am convinced, that no circum∣stance preceding the general judgment, can affect the argument; because we are informed, that the condemnation of the wicked shall be at that day; then GOD will render to them according to their deeds, and will say to them, <HI>Depart from me,</HI> &amp;c.—But the following texts of Scripture form a strong objection to the universal Restoration, which I would wish you well to consider.</P>
<P>'The expectation of the wicked shall perish; and the hypocrite's hope shall perish: Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a spider's web. He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand; he shall hold it fast, but it shall not endure. The heaven shall reveal his iniquity, and the earth shall rise up against him. The eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not escape;
<PB N="175" REF="025050_0231_102D7138C4219A18"/>
and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost. His confidence, shall be rooted out of his taberna∣cle, and it shall bring him to the king of ter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ors. For what is the hope of the wicked, though he hath gained, when GOD taketh away his soul? Will GOD hear his cry, when trouble cometh up∣on him? He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy. When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish; and the hope of unjust men perisheth. Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded: But ye have set at nought all my coun∣sel, and would none of my reproof: I also will laugh at your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh; When your fear cometh as desola∣tion, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you: Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me early, but they shall not find me: For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of JEHOVAH. They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof. Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.' Prov. x. 28. Job viii. 13, 14, 15 xx. 27. xi. 20. xviii. 14. xxvii. 8, 9. Prov. xxix. 1. xi. 7. i. 24—31.</P>
<P>These, and abundance of other similar passages, declare the future state of the wicked to be despe∣rate, without hope; they and their hopes perish together, as the spider's web; they have no hopes or prospect of being redeemed; they can look for nothing but judgment and fiery indignation, which shall devour them as stubble fully dry, and as thorns cut up shall they be burned in the fire. Solomon
<PB N="176" REF="025050_0232_102D749F27D3A9D8"/>
says, 'The expectation of the wicked is wrath,' Prov, xi. 23. 'As he loved cursing, so shall it come unto him: as he delighted not in blessing, so shall it be far from him. As he cloathed himself with cursing, like as with his garment; so shall it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones,' Psal. cix. 17, 18. Indeed he can have no hopes, when he considers that he hath neglect∣ed so great a salvation all his life; that he hath set at nought GOD'S counsels, despised his reproofs: that when his CREATOR called to him to turn, he had no ears to hear his voice; and therefore, when sorrow shall overtake, though he may cry, he shall not be regarded of God; and though he may seek, he shall not find: the Master of the house having risen up, and shut to the door, all knocking for entrance is in vain, even though such were to plead for admittance in the most earnest manner, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open to us;' he shall answer, 'I know you not whence you are;' and though they may reiterate, and expostulate, saying, 'We have eaten and drank in thy presence, and thou hast taught in our streets;' he shall not be moved, but shall say to them, 'I tell you, I know you not whence you are; depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity. There shall be weeping, and gnashing of teeth, when they shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, and they themselves thrust out.' St. Luke xiii. 25, 26, 27, 28. See also, St. Matth. vii. 21, 22, 23, xxv. 11, 12.</P>

<P>These are awful warnings, indeed; and were they attended to as they ought to be, would be sufficient, one would think, to deter men from their evil ways: I am glad that you have
<PB N="177" REF="025050_0233_102D713A97A7FC08"/>
stated them in this most striking point of light; for though they form no real objection to my views of GOD'S dealing with men, as I understand the Scriptures, they are an insuperable bar to the opinions of those who deny a future state of retri∣bution, which I think impossible for them to an∣swer fairly. I shall, however, notice briefly, some things in this collection of Scriptures, in or∣der that my sentiments may appear in their true light.</P>
<P N="1">1. All the hopes of the wicked, ungodly, and hypocrites, shall perish at their death.</P>
<P>Perhaps they hoped to have lived long, to have enjoyed health, wealth, pleasure, and all worldly good, for many years; to have seen their children for many generations, flourishing for a long time on earth; but death destroys these hopes.</P>
<P>The hypocrites might have hoped that they should have been accepted with GOD, on the account of their birth, parentage, profession, rank among the people of GOD, observation of the externals of re∣ligion, &amp;c. &amp;c. all of which vain hopes do certain∣ly perish at death.</P>
<P>The profane and wicked infidel, and practical atheist, might have hoped, either to have ceased to exist, or to have found some way of escaping the threatened punishment; but death destroys these hopes also.</P>
<P N="2">2. Whatever may be the final intention of GOD towards these miserable creatures, it is evident they are shut up in a state of keen tormenting des∣pair, or dreadful suspense, and may be fully per∣suaded that they shall never be released, of which it is likely they may not have even the most distant
<PB N="178" REF="025050_0234_102D74A128879470"/>
hope, or the least degree of knowledge—but, on the contrary, be in fearful expectation of more terrible punishment hereafter.</P>
<P N="3">3. As they have lived and died in sin, their de∣struction, or misery, is certain—and there is no remedy, that can prevent their experiencing the consequences of their crimes, and suffering the just punishment which shall be inflicted on them, ac∣cording to their different deserts.</P>
<P N="4">4. They who live and die in rebellion against GOD, will be eternally deprived of the glories and honours of the kingdom of <HI>Christ,</HI> which other∣wise they might have possessed; will be excluded from a share in the first resurrection, and will be exposed to suffer the torments of the second death; which all must inevitably suffer, who remain incor∣rigible till the great day of judgment.</P>
<P N="5">5. As God hath called, and they have refused, it is but reasonable to suppose, that they, in their turn, shall cry in vain: yet nevertheless, though he may long delay, he may hear their cries, and deliver them at last. See Psal. cvii. 13, 14, 15, 16.</P>
<P>David, in Psalm xxxivth says, 'The face of JE∣HOVAH is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.' Our trans∣lators not understanding, or not entertaining an idea of the future Restoration, add, '<HI>The righte∣ous</HI> cry, and JEHOVAH heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.' Whereas the Holy Ghost has put no such words as <HI>the righteous</HI> into the text there; but after saying, that the face of JEHOVAH is against them that do evil, to destroy them out of the world, and to make them forgot∣ten, and their names to cease upon the earth, it adds
<PB N="179" REF="025050_0235_102D717AE0130388"/>
a word that signifies <HI>crying,</HI> and then says, 'And JEHOVAH heareth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles:' See ver. 16, 17. This seems, in∣deed, like the doctrine of the Bible, which else∣where says, speaking of the notoriously wicked; 'O my God, make them like a wheel: as the stub∣ble before the wind. As the fire burneth the wood, and as the flame setteth the mountains on fire; so persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with thy storm. Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy name, O JEHOVAH. Let them be confounded, and troubled for ever; yea, let them be put to shame, and perish. And they shall know (as the Hebrew word signifies, and as it is rendered in the old translation) 'that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth,' Psal. lxxxiii. 13—18.—Here we see, in a beautiful and clear manner, that one grand design of God in bringing judgments, and even what is called utter destruction, upon men, is that they may know that he is JEHOVAH, the true God: and there are but few intelligent Christians, but must, in some measure, be able to conceive hopes concerning all those to whom the knowledge of God is promised.</P>
<P>Though the threatenings in the prophecy of Ezekiel, both against the Jews and other nations, are uncommonly severe; yet they frequently close with this gracious promise—'And they shall know that I am JEHOVAH'—or something similar; as will evidently appear to those who will be at the pains of examining the following passages in that book.</P>
<P>EZEKIEL, vi. 7, 10, 13, 14. vii. 4, 9, 27. xi. 10, 12. xii. 15, 16, 20. xiii. 9, 14, 21, 23. xiv. 8.

<P>But does not punishment harden and inflame offenders, instead of softening and hum∣bling them? As we read, Isa. viii. 21. 'They shall curse their King and their GOD, and look upward:' and, in Rev. xvi. 9, 10, 11. 'And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name of GOD, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented not to give him glory. And they gnawed their tongues for pain, and blas∣phemed the GOD of Heaven, because of their pains and their sores; and repented not of their deeds.'</P>

<P>Punishment, to a certain degree, in∣flames and enrages, in a most amasing manner; but continued longer, and heavier, produces a con∣trary effect—softens, humbles, and subdues. When Ephraim, of old, bemoaned himself, he said thus:—'Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke; turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art JEHOVAH, my GOD,' Jer. xxxi. 18. The metaphor here used, expresses, in a most lively manner, the different effects of the same discipline, in its beginning, progress, and end. When a bullock first has the yoke laid on his neck, he frets, tosses, and rages exceedingly; but, by a continuance of the disci∣pline, he is subdued, brought down, humbled, and tamed, so as to become the most useful and
<PB N="181" REF="025050_0237_102D7324BB0CBEB8"/>
gentle of animals. The sons of Zion are repre∣sented as lying 'at the head of all the streets, as a wild bull in a net; full of the fury of JEHOVAH, the rebuke of GOD,' Isai. li. 20. A wild bull, in a net, must be a furious creature; so are men, when first they are brought under the Divine cor∣rection. But GOD knows how to correct men, in such a manner as to bring them to submit to him, in due time; and though some are so sunk in sin as not to be reformed, by any means, in this life; yet that is no argument, that GOD is not able to subdue and bring down the proud and most rebel∣lious, in another state, by means that may be used effectually there, though they could not be used here. GOD says, by the prophet to Israel. 'Be∣cause I have purged thee, and thou wast not purg∣ed, thou shalt not be purged from thy filthiness any more till I have caused my fury to rest upon thee. So will I make my fury towards thee to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from thee; and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry,' Ezek. xxiv. 13. xvi. 42. Some sins are so daring and presump∣tuous, as to provoke GOD to threaten, that they shall not be purged away in this life; and, perhaps, their malignancy may be so great, that nothing that can be used here, is able to subdue them: Thus, when GOD threatened his people, of old, with destruction, they turned his threatenings into ridi∣cule: instead of weeping, mourning, baldness, and girding with sackcloth, to which God called them; there was nothing but 'joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: Let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. And it was revealed in mine ears, by JEHO∣VAH of Hosts, Surely, this iniquity shall not be
<PB N="182" REF="025050_0238_102D74A4C7BBA8F8"/>
purged from you till ye die, saith JEHOVAH, God of Israel,' Isai. xxii. 12, 13, 14.</P>
<P>Thus, punishments are designed for the humb∣ling of the proud: but if they fail of answering that purpose, as administered in the present state, they will be continued and increased in future pe∣riods, to such a degree, as shall bring all down in due time. Those pains which produced that rage and blasphemy which you mentioned, were all poured out on hardened sinners in the present life; and were so terrible and severe as to produce those fearful effects, but not sufficiently so as to produce the contrary.</P>
<P>That punishment, to a certain degree, produces rage, but to a certain degree beyond, produces submission; may be illustrated by the follow∣ing fact, as well as many others, of the same nature.</P>
<P>In the former war between England and France, there was one Mr. —, of Virginia, who was waggon-master-general in the army of the Provincials. He was guilty of abusing his power, by frequently striking the soldiers with his waggon-whip. Complaint being made, a court-martial was held, and he was sentenced to receive five hundred lashes; which sentence was executed upon him. When first he began to feel the lash, he was exceedingly enraged, and cursed those who had thus sentenced him; swearing, that if he lived to be released, he would kill them all, if possible; for that he valued not his life, in the least, but would revenge this disgrace, by killing them, wherever he found them; and much more, to the same purpose. But, before he had received half his punishment, he declared, that he had not the
<PB N="183" REF="025050_0239_102D73277A063F80"/>
least disposition to lift his hand against them; he saw clearly that they had acted right; that he had been entirely to blame; and that his punishment was just. After his correction was over, he was led quietly away, entirely cured of all his rage; from which he was as much freed by his punish∣ment, as ever an effect was produced by a cause. He was healed of his wounds, and, I think, restor∣ed to his post.—Some time after the war was over, he was passing one day over those mountains in Virginia, commonly called <HI>The Blue Ridge;</HI> and there he met alone one of the men who had con∣demned him, in the court-martial, to such a pu∣nishment. He put him in mind of it; and told him, that it was now in his power to retaliate up∣on him. The other acknowledged that he was in his power; but added, 'M—, you know you did wrong, and deserved the punishment you re∣ceived; and if you kill me, I declare, that we did right in sentencing you to be whipped; I should do the same, were it to do again; and so would you have done, had you been in my place.' Mr. M—acknowledged the truth of it; and was so far from fulfilling his threatenings, that he suffered him to go in peace, highly commending him for his con∣duct. Mr. M— may be still living: he was a general in the American army during the late war, and acquired great honour, for his valour and good conduct.</P>
<P>This I think is an argument <HI>ad hominem.</HI> I have often observed instances of the same nature, in a less degree; and I think it must be admitted, that although a certain degree of punishment will en flame, harden, and enrage; yet, farther degrees produce quite contrary effects. Nor is punish∣ment
<PB N="184" REF="025050_0240_102D74A6C0BB0AD0"/>
the only thing in nature that produces con∣trary effects, according to the quantity used; al∣most all things do the same. Thus, water, with a little salt in it, will cause pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>refaction, much soon∣er than perfectly fresh water; but let it be satura∣ted with salt, and it will preserve bodies that are cast therein. A little salt cast on the earth is good manure, and causes fruitfulness; but a great∣er quantity produces the contrary effect, by caus∣ing barrenness. A little wine refreshes, cheers, invigorates; but, taken to excess, stupifies and in∣toxic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es. And, to mention no more instances, a little smattering of knowledge puffs up the mind; but a greater degree, humbles and brings it down: From whence,

<P>But let me ask you: When you view the miserable state of fallen men, the inveterate obsti∣nacy of their wills, the total aversion that many have to God and goodness, their confirmed habits of evil, their amazing love of vice, their opposi∣tion to every method taken to reclaim them, and a thousand other dreadful circumstances, which you must have observed; are you not ready to des∣pair of their recovery? not for any want of good∣ness in God, but through their total incapacity of ever being made better.</P>

<P>I must confess, this objection has great weight; and I have often been ready to give up my own salvation, on account of the evils of my own heart, which sometimes rise, and prevail in such a manner, as almost drives me to despair: and I can find no relief, but by flying to <HI>Jesus,</HI> as
<PB N="185" REF="025050_0241_102D73290B64EA78"/>
my only refuge, and trusting in his promises: And the case is the same with respect to the Restoration of all men. My weak reason tells me, that it can∣not be; that it is absolutely impossible, that such hardened rebels can be so changed to eternity, as to become willing and obedient subjects: but when faith prevails, it informs me, that the things which are impossible with men, are possible with GOD; that nothing is too hard for JEHOVAH; and that he hath said—'Behold, I am JEHOVAH, the the GOD of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me?' Jer. xxxii. 27. And the example of A∣braham has often proved a great support to me in this case; 'who, against hope, believed in hope, that he might become the father of many nations; according to that which was spoken, So shall thy seed be: and being not weak in faith, he consi∣dered not" the impediments, which, to the eye of reason, rendered the accomplishment of the pro∣mises improbable, if not impossible. 'He stag∣gered not at the promise of GOD, through unbe∣lief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to GOD: And being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he was able also to perform,' Rom. iv. 18, 19, 20, 21.</P>
<P>This is the only way I answer this objection to my own satisfaction—GOD hath sworn, that to him every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear, Isai. xlv. 23.—That in the name of <HI>Jesus,</HI> every knee shall bow, of things in heaven, things on earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue shall confess, that <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> is Lord, to the glory of <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Father,</HI> Phil. ii. 10, 11. That it is the mystery of his will, according to his good
<PB N="186" REF="025050_0242_102D74A8B22AC600"/>
pleasure, which he hath purposed in himself, in the dispensation of the fulness of the times, to ga∣ther together, or rehead, in one, all things in <HI>Christ;</HI> both which are in heaven, and which are on earth; even in him, Ephes. i. 9, 10,—And having made peace through the blood of his cross, he is deter∣mined to reconcile all things unto himself; whe∣ther things in heaven, or things on earth, Col. i. 20.—That he worketh all things after the coun∣sel of his own will, Ephes. i. 11.—That he will have all men to be saved, or restored, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth, 1 Tim. ii. 6.—That the Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hands, St. John iii. 35.—And that <HI>Christ</HI> hath said, 'All that the Father giveth me, shall come unto me; and him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out,' St. John vi. 37.—When I consider these, and many such like promises, which I find in the Scriptures; and that he that hath promised, is able to perform; hath wisdom, power, and goodness, sufficient to ac∣complish all his words, how difficult or impossible soever the matter may seem, to our carnal, vain, and weak reasoning; I cast the whole of my con∣cern upon him; judging, that he is faithful who hath promised, and that, in his own time, he will fulfil all his purposes, and all his promises. But I confess to you, that it requires a faith, if possi∣ble, more strong than that of Abraham, to believe the doctrine of the Restoration stedfastly, in the midst of so much evil as prevails in the world, and which seems to render it impossible: But my only hope is in GOD.</P>
<P>But, to encourage us the more, there are not only promises of what GOD will do, but examples
<PB N="187" REF="025050_0243_102D739A41D0AD08"/>
of what he hath done, recorded in Scripture, as the cases of <HI>Manasseh, Nebuchadnezzar, Mary Mag∣dalen, Saul,</HI> and many of the murderers of our Lord, priests, and even Pharisees, are left on re∣cord, as patterns of GOD'S long-suffering, power, mercy, and love.—And I would advise those Chris∣tians that doubt of the universal Reconciliation of all things, to remember St. Paul's words to the Colossians, on this subject, chap. i. 21. 'And you that were some time alienated, and enemies in your mind, by wicked works, yet now hath he reconciled;' as a proof and example of his power to reconcile all things. Let all remember their own stubbornness; and then, instead of reviling and deriding a truth which GOD has revealed, they will adore him, of whom, through whom, and to whom, are all things; who 'doeth accord∣ing to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?' Rom. xi. 36. Dan. iv. 35.</P>

<P>But allowing that God has power to change the hearts of the vilest of men, is not the exercise of that power evidently limited? for I find it written in Rev. xxii. 11.—'He that is unjust, let him be unjust still; and he that is filthy, let him be filthy still; and he that is righteous, let him be righteous still; and he that is holy, let him be holy still.' By these words it seems to be intimated, that the characters of both the wicked and the righteous, shall at some period be so confirmed and fixed, as to admit of no change or alteration.</P>

<P>This appears to be a considerable dif∣ficulty, but can by no means overthrow the system
<PB N="188" REF="025050_0244_102D74AA817974E8"/>
of the Restoration, which seems established upon many gracious promises. The words seem to re∣fer to a particular period, even when the Lord shall come, and shew that his coming will not, (as some suppose) change the characters of men; but that all shall continue, for a certain time, in the same character as before. But, though 'he that is unjust, shall be unjust still; and he that is fil∣thy, shall be filthy still'—during the age of judg∣ment; and shall have the dreadful curse pronoun∣ced upon him; for, 'If any man love not the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be anathema, Maran∣atha: that is, Accursed, the Lord cometh: 1 Cor. xvi. 22. Yet I trust that I have proved, that the vilest shall be finally changed; and consequent∣ly, that these words must be understood with some limitation. And thus though this text is plainly contrary to the opinion of those who sup∣pose that all the human race shall be admitted in∣to the kingdom of heaven at the day of judgment, yet it may be well reconciled to the system laid down in these Dialogues; especially if it can be proved that similar expressions are used, where a limitation is supposed, or necessarily implied.</P>

<P>St. Paul says, 1 Cor. xiv. 38. 'But if any man be ignorant, let him him be ignorant:' But we can hardly suppose that he meant without limitation.

And David saith;—'Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumbling-block, and a recompence unto them.

Let their eyes be darkened that they should not see, and bow down their back ALWAY,' Rom. xi, 8, 9, 10. These expressions of their remaining in a blinded, hardened, and reprobate state, are stronger than those—'He that is unjust let him be unjust still, &amp;c. for, instead of <HI>still,</HI> the word <HI>al∣way</HI> is used; and yet we are informed, that this 'blindness in part has (only) happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in: And so all Israel shall be saved.' And that 'GOD hath concluded them all (<HI>or,</HI> shut them up together) in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all,' even all whom he had shut up, or concluded in unbelief. And, as I observed before, David says; 'Fill their faces with shame, that they may seek thy name, O JEHOVAH. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever: yea, let them be put shame, and perish; That <HI>they</HI> may know that thou whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art the Most High over all the earth,' Psal. lxxxiii. 16, 17, 18. Many other similar passages might be mentioned; but these may suffice, to shew, that often where the words <HI>Let it,</HI> or <HI>Let them be,</HI> in such-and-such a state, they only intend a certain period, until ano∣ther dispensation takes place. As for righteous∣ness, holiness, and happiness, they have quite a different foundation from sin and impurity, as I have shewn before; and therefore, no arguments used in favour of the total destruction of evil, can, in the least, prove, that goodness, which is the Di∣vine essence, shall cease; but the contrary: and those who are firmly joined to the LORD, and have continued with him through the state of temptation, shall never cease to be righteous, nor be separated from their Head, from whom they shall derive

eternal life: for CHRIST hath said, 'Because I live, ye shall live also.' St. John xiv. 19.</P>
<P>CHRIST, at his coming, will bring every hidden thing to light, and shall take off all disguises; so that he that is unjust, shall appear unjust; and he that is filthy, shall be discovered: hypocrisy shall be no more. 'The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl said to be bountiful,' Isai xxxii. 5. 'Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and the wicked; and be∣tween him that serveth God, and him that serv∣eth him not,' Mal. iii. 18. The judgment of God is according to truth, and is designed to make an entire discovery of all persons, and all secret things, 'that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God,' Rom. iii. 19. But though judgment has its great use in discovering, laying open, convincing, and condemning; and punishment, in destroying, subduing, and humbling; yet the powerful, sav∣ing grace of GOD, and the operation of the di∣vine Spirit, must have the glory of restoring, or creating men anew; and the blood of JESUS must cleanse their souls from the guilt and pollution of sin. Evil must be destroyed out of them: this is done by afflictions; and goodness must be restor∣ed; this is done by God's renewing power and grace.</P>
<P>But the objection may be answered another way, without any of this reasoning, by considering the subject comparatively. Thus: As God only is holy; as none are good but he, in an absolute sense; as he putteth no trust in his holy ones, and the heavens are not clean in his sight, and his an∣gels he charged with folly; (See Job xv. 15. iv.
<PB N="191" REF="025050_0247_102D739DF088F8F8"/>
18.) and as all intelligences, compared with him, are unjust and unclean; so, those who have lived and died in rebellion against God, and in the pol∣lution of sin, may remain unjust and filthy, com∣pared with the saints, those vessels of honour and glory, who have purged themselves. 'But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood, and of earth; and some to honour and some to dishonour. If a man, therefore, purge himself from these (sins), he shall be a vessel of honour, sanctified and meet for the master's use, and prepared unto every good work,' 2 Tim. ii. 20, 21. Here we may observe, that in our Lord's great house there shall be divers ves∣sels of various kinds, yet all useful, but some more highly so than others; that honour and dishonour are comparative terms; and that the way to be∣come vessels of the highest honour at last, is to purge ourselves from iniquity while on earth, by obeying the truth. For it must appear evident, from the nature of things, that there will always be an immense difference between those who shall be kings and priests to God, and those who shall be subdued in the ages to come, so as to be sub∣jects, but who shall not attain to that honour and glory, which they shall have who suffer with Christ here, and shall be glorified with him here∣after.</P>

<P>Since I have conversed with you I must acknowledge that many things have appeared in a different light from what they did before; and if I do not wholly embrace the doctrine of the Restoration, I must allow that there is much more to be said for it than I could have imagined. But I have still some difficulties that I wish to propose.
<PB N="192" REF="025050_0248_102D74AE2ACE34C8"/>
There is a terrible threatening, which is indeed the last in the Bible, that I should be glad to hear your thoughts upon, which is thus expressed, (Rev. xxii. 18. 19.) 'For testify unto every man, that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book; If any man shall add unto these things, GOD shall add unto him the plagues that are writ∣ten in this book: And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, GOD shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are written in this book:' But I can almost foresee how you will answer this; that though the plagues that are written in this book, shall be add∣ed, yet mercy shall finally rejoice against judg∣ment; and though a man's part may be taken out of the book of life, and he, in consequence, suf∣fer the torments of the second death: yet, as the time will come, when there shall be no more death of any kind, neither sorrow, nor crying, nor any more pain; his Restoration may be certainly in∣ferred; and though his part in the heavenly city may be forfeited, so that he may never become one of those who shall reign therein, nor yet have a constant dwelling there; he may, nevertheless, enter as a worshipper, and a subject of the great King; and may drink of the water of life; feed on the fruits of the tree of life, and be healed by its leaves; and be one of the happy inhabitants of the new earth, which God will create.</P>

<P>Yes, my friend: But though this Scripture may be easily reconciled to the plan laid down in these dialogues; it contains such threat∣enings as are very terrible indeed; and should m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e us exceeding careful not to contradict what God
<PB N="193" REF="025050_0249_102D739F881DF120"/>
hath here revealed, by adding vain interpretati∣ons of our own, contrary to the sense of the text; nor in any wise to explain away, or weaken, the force of either the threatenings or promises, set forth in this wondrous book. The amazing tor∣ments which they shall feel that have these plagues added to them, and the dreadful loss which they shall sustain that have their part taken out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, cannot be even conceived: And it being possible to forfeit this glorious portion entirely, and for ever, made St. Paul warn the Hebrews in such a solemn man∣ner as he doth throughout the whole epistle—Oh, what affecting advice is the following!—'Looking diligently, lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness, springing up trouble you, and thereby many be defiled: Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau; who, for one morsel of meat, sold his birthwright. For ye know, how that afterward, when he would have inherited the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of repent∣ance, though he sought it carefully, with tears,' Heb. xii. 15, 16, 17.</P>
<LG>
<L>'Poor Esau repented too late,</L>
<L>'That once he his birthright despis'd;</L>
<L>'And sold for a morsel of meat,</L>
<L>'What could not too highly be priz'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'How great was his anguish, when told,</L>
<L>'The blessing he sought to obtain</L>
<L>'Was gone, with the birthright he sold;</L>
<L>'And none could recal it again!</L>
</LG>
<P><PB N="194" REF="025050_0250_102D74B024A220C8"/>
Thus, though Esau, as well as Jacob, was blessed concerning things to come; (See Heb. xi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o) yet the birthright, and the particular bless∣ings connected therewith, he lost for ever: And so it is possible that we may lose our parts in the holy city, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o such threatenings would ever have been made. For it is a maxim with me—That God never warns, where there is no danger to fear; and never encourages us to hope, where there is no possibility of obtaining.</P>
<P>As the glorious and universal deliverance of all men from the bondage of sin, and their obtaining an inheritance in the new earth, was clearly point∣ed out by the great year of Jubilee, under the law; in which every servant went out free, and every man returned to his possession, and to his family; (See Lev. xxv. 10.) So, the possibility of being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut off from the holy city, for ever, was pointed out by that notable exception, ver. 29, 30.—'And if a man sell a dwelling-house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year af∣ter it is sold; within a full year, may he redeem it. And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that is in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it, throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the Jubilee.'</P>
<P>Something similar to this may be found in Rev. iii. 11.—'Behold, I come quickly; hold that fast which thou hast, that no man take thy crown:' And the 5th verse is also worthy of consideration—'He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life; but I will confess his name before my Father, and before his an∣gels.'—
<PB N="195" REF="025050_0251_102D74C9CD59FFD0"/>
O, what promises are made to overcom∣ers! That they shall eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the Paradise of GOD; shall have a crown of life; and shall not be hurt of the se∣cond death; shall eat of the hidden manna; shall have a white stone, and a new name, which no man knoweth, saving he that receiveth it; shall have power over the nations, &amp;c. even as Christ received of the Father: shall walk with him in white; shall be esteemed worthy to be compani∣ons and friends of God; shall be clothed in white; shall have their names enrolled among the follow∣ers of the Lamb, as called, chosen, and faithful; shall be confessed by the Son of God, before his Father, and the holy angels; shall be made pil∣lars in the temple of God, and shall go no more out; shall have the name of GOD written upon their foreheads, and the name of the holy city, New Jerusalem, and Christ's new, heavenly name; shall sit with him upon his throne, even as he o∣vercame, and is set down with the Father, upon his throne; shall inherit all things; shall be called the sons of God: See Rev. ii. 7, 10, 11, 17, 26, 27. iii. 4, 5, 12, 21. xvii. 14. xxi. 7.</P>
<P>The apostle assures us, that 'If (we are) chil∣dren, then (are we) heirs; heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together.' And then adds—'For I reckon that the suffer∣ings of the present time, are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us,' Rom. viii. 17, 18. 'When Christ, who is our life, shall appear; then shall ye (his saints) also appear with him in glory,' Col. iii. 4, 'We know, that when he shall appear, we shall be like
<PB N="196" REF="025050_0252_102D74B1E7DFE2C0"/>
him; for we shall see him as he is,' 1 John iii. 2. But let none of those who believe themselves the heirs of this kingdom, &amp;c. dare to indulge them∣selves in sin, under a notion that God can never cast them off; as some do.</P>
<P>A Preacher whom I once knew, encouraged this wickedly presumptuous disposition so far, as, openly, to say: 'God cannot damn me: He can as soon cease to be God, as he can cast me off: even though I should sin ever so much. If I should kill a man, he could not damn me; nay, if I should kill all the men in the world, he can∣not damn me.'—This man was rigid in trifles, re∣ligiously scrupulous in frivolous things, such as <HI>dress, &amp;c.</HI> yet he made traffick of the human kind, engaged in war, and performed acts of cruelty and outrage with as little tenderness as may be imagined▪ He long bloated himself with the no∣tion of God's peculiar favour—but, near the close of his life, the displeasure of the Almighty com∣ing visibly upon him, the <HI>rhapsodist</HI> changed his tone, and exclaimed, that God had forsaken him!</P>
<P>I would advise all men, of that bold, presuming, self-confident spirit, to read and consider well those words, in Jer. xxii. 24. 'As I live, saith JEHOVAH, though <HI>Coniah,</HI> the son of <HI>Jehoiakim,</HI> king of Judah, were the signet upon my right hand; yet would I pluck thee thence.'</P>
<P>Consider, first, who speaks, JEHOVAH: He not only speaks, but he confirms his threatening with an oath; and, because he could swear by no great∣er, he sware by himself, by his own life; 'As I live, saith JEHOVAH, though <HI>Coniah,</HI> the son of <HI>Je∣hoiakim,</HI> king of Judah;' though he is of the fami∣ly of <HI>David,</HI> with whom I have made an evarlast∣ing
<PB N="197" REF="025050_0253_102D74CC38C157B8"/>
covenant, ordered in all things, and sure; and though he is anointed king over my people; I will not spare him: yea, though he 'were the sig∣net upon my right hand; yet would I pluck thee thence.' Signets, upon the hands of ancient Persi∣an monarchs, were those seals with which their decrees were sealed and confirmed: so that no man could reverse them. Now, God declares, that if this man was ever so dear, and as necessary, to him, as the signet on the right hand of a king is to its owner; that though he was not able to go∣vern his kingdom without his assistance; though he had been the dearest and most useful thing: he would entirely cast him off, for his transgressions. And how much more so, if it be considered, that no man is necessary to God; that man cannot be profitable to him; that neither our wickedness can hurt him, nor our righteousness benefit him: (See Job xxii. 2, 3. xxxv. 6, 7, 8. Psal. xvi. 2, 3.) And that he threatens to punish the only family that he had known on earth, for all their iniqui∣ties; Amos iii. 2. What have not those to fear, who have been placed in high stations, entrusted with precious treasures, great abilities, opportuni∣ties, &amp;c. and have abused them!—Let such read, and seriously consider, St. Luke xii. 42—48. St. Matth. xxiv. 45—51. 2 Pet. ii. 20, 21, 22.</P>

<P>These considerations are, on one hand, glorious and sublime, beyond conception; and, on the other, terrible, beyond description. But some say, That if they are only admitted into the kingdom of God, and are not cast into the lake of fire, it is the highest of their ambition: that they never aspire to be kings and priests; nor to obtain
<PB N="198" REF="025050_0254_102D74B3A1B804E0"/>
a crown, throne, sceptre, &amp;c. And others say, That if they are ever, to all eternity, to be deli∣vered from their misery, that it is a matter of little consequence to them whether they are followers of Christ here, or not.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>These kind of reflections are frequent∣ly thrown out by the enemies of the Restoration, to cast an odium upon the doctrine: But if they were to hear a man say; 'If I am just suffered to enter into this kingdom, and am not condemn∣ed as a rebel, it is all I wish; I desire neither the riches, honours, pleasures, conveniencies, nor even the necessaries, that many of the inhabitants en∣joy: all I ask is to be exempted from the pain and shame of public punishment:' And another was to add—'I can see little or no difference between be∣ing made heir apparent to the crown, possessing all the privileges, honours, dignities, &amp;c. of a prince of the blood; and being hanged, drawn, and quar∣tered, for high treason; since even that punish∣ment, painful and shameful as it is, must come to an end:' I ask, Would they not esteem both these men in a state of insanity, or worse; entire∣ly devoid of all sense and reason? Yet, this unrea∣sonable language, is not worthy to be named in the same day with that which you mentioned. The difference is so great, I cannot find language to express it. I therefore consider all such persons as madmen, with whom it is not worth while to reason; who understand not what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>So they appear to me. But the system you have laid down, appears equally calculated to check presumption and despair, and to cure all such spiritual madness; provided that they will at∣tend
<PB N="199" REF="025050_0255_102D74CDCEDD5BE0"/>
to it.—But, what will you say to the doc∣trine of <HI>annihilation? that</HI> may not be liable to the same objections as <HI>endless damnation;</HI> and so the wicked may be punished with <HI>everlasting destruction,</HI> and destroyed, soul and body, in hell; and yet, at last, all beings that are in existence may be made happy. The Scripture seems, in many places, to favour this idea; and the works of nature seem to confirm it. For instance; many fruits and animals perish, before they arrive at perfection; and why may it not be so with the souls and bodies of men? they are no where said to be raised to incorruption, or immortality; but to be destroyed, to be cast into the lake of fire, to be burnt up, root and branch: to be consumed, devoured, burnt up as chaff, thorns, &amp;c. I need not mention particular texts; because the general part of the threaten∣ings in the Scriptures run in that stile. And I have sometimes of late reasoned with myself, that the second death must end either in the restoration or annihilation of those who were cast therein; for there seemed something in <HI>endless misery,</HI> that sur∣passed my belief, at times. But I could not satis∣fy myself, whether the wicked would be finally restored to some degree of happiness, or totally destroyed; and was apt to think the latter, as it seemed a strange figure of speech to call <HI>destruction,</HI> Restoration.—Pray, have you ever thought upon this matter?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>There are but three possible things that can befal those who are cast into the second death; either <HI>endless misery, total annihilation,</HI> or <HI>Restoration:</HI> a fourth cannot be thought upon; and but one of these can be true. Now, where there are only three possibilities, of which only
<PB N="200" REF="025050_0256_102D74B531B33888"/>
one <HI>can</HI> be true, and one <HI>must</HI> be true; there are these two ways of discovering the truth: First, if two of the propositions are proved to be absurd, the third must stand: 2dly, if one be proved true, the others must fall to the ground of conse∣quence. I have taken the second method; and having shewed that the doctrine of the Restoration is not absurd, and therefore that it is true; conse∣quently, the others are false.—But, besides this way of arguing, there are three circumstances which prove to my satisfaction,<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at <HI>annihilation</HI> is not a truth.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That at the very time that the wicked are de∣stroyed, they are said to be tormented with fire and brimstone: and that they have no rest, day nor night; and the continuance of this is for no short time, (as would probably be the case, if the intention of God was only to destroy them out of being) but for the age of ages. Rev. xiv. 10. 11.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They are put to shame, and perish, that they may know the Lord; as I have noticed before: See Psal. xxxiv. 16, 17. lxxxiii. 16, 17, 18.—and the observations I have made upon these passages in the dialogues.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. But that on which I dare venture the whole cause, is, that God hath absolutely promised to re∣store and bring again those whom he hath utterly destroyed.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>Can you prove that? For if you can, it will settle the whole controversy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>I trust I can, in many instances: But I will fix upon one that is full to the purpose, and unexceptionable; and that is, the case of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and her daughters, <HI>Gomorrah, Admah,</HI> and <HI>Zeboim,</HI>
<PB N="201" REF="025050_0257_102D74D005E0F970"/>
who, 'giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an ex∣ample, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire,' Jude 7.</P>
<P>As they are set forth for an example in their pu∣nishment, so also in their restoration: For we may certainly argue, that if any of the human race shall be annihilated, the inhabitants of <HI>Sodom, Gomorrah,</HI> &amp;c. will be; as they were condemned with an overthrow, and made an example to those who should after live ungodly, 2 Pet. ii. 6. But these wicked nations shall have their captivity returned; shall return to their former estate; and shall be received by <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as daughters, in the ever∣lasting covenant: <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and her daughters, more wicked themselves, than <HI>Sodom</HI> and her daugh∣ters, shall be restored at the same time; shall re∣member their ways, and be ashamed; shall never open mouth any more to glory over the meanest of mankind; when the great JEHOVAH shall be paci∣fied towards <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> for all that she has done, and towards <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Samaria,</HI> for all that they have done also, inasmuch as they shall return from their long captivity, and be given to <HI>Je∣rusalem</HI> for daughters; See Ezek. xvi. 53, 55, 61, 63.</P>
<P>Now, by Sodom and her daughters being re∣turned from their long and dreadful captivity, we must understand one of three things: either, first, the return of their descendants; or, secondly, the restoration of the land whereon the cities stood; or, lastly, the restoration of those very persons who were destroyed.</P>
<P>It cannot be the first; for there are none of their descendants remaining on earth: all were destroy∣ed
<PB N="202" REF="025050_0258_102D74B6F6CB8AC8"/>
by fire and brimstone: none of the inhabitants escaped, Lot and his daughters excepted: who were only sojourners, and were descendants of Te∣rah, and relations to Abraham.</P>
<P>As it cannot be the first, let us try the second. A very ingenious gentleman supposes, that in the time of the Millenium, the Dead Sea shall be turn∣ed into land, and shall again become a beautiful, well-watered plain, and be given to the posterity of <HI>Abraham, Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Jacob:</HI> For he argues, and seemingly very justly, that as God promised <HI>Abraham</HI> all the land which he could see from the place where he then stood; (See Gen. xiii. 14, 15, 16, 17.) and as the plain of <HI>Sodom</HI> was in sight, it was included in the grant: and, though the Dead Sea now occupies the place where those cities stood; yet God's promise cannot fail: and, there∣fore, in the Millenium, the Dead Sea shall be swal∣lowed up, and the place shall become a fruitful plain. But whoever will read Ezek. xlvii. 8, 9, 10, 11. may plainly see, that the waters that shall issue out from under the threshold of the holy house, shall be brought into the Dead Sea; and shall so heal those deadly waters, that they shall be∣come fruitful, and bring forth fish in great abund∣ance; exceeding many, like the great sea, which is now called the <HI>Mediterranean;</HI> which fish shall be more useful for food, to the innumerable inhabit∣ants that shall then be in that happy country, than all the vegetables that would grow there, even though the whole place was turned into a fruitful garden.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But are you certain, that by <HI>the sea,</HI> is meant <HI>the Dead Sea,</HI> or <HI>Lake of Sodom?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="203" REF="025050_0259_102D74D1CD2A77D8"/>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes. 1. Because all the other waters in those parts, produce great plenty of excellent fish; and, therefore, need not healing. 2. Be∣cause fishers shall stand upon the banks of the sea, from En-gedi even unto En-eglaim, places that are well known to be contiguous to the Dead Sea; one of which is nearly at the north-east corner, the other at the west end of the same. 3. The marshes, and the miry places thereof, shall not be healed; but shall be given to salt, as specimens of what the whole is at this time; which barren and dead∣ly spots shall remain, as standing evidences of the truth of Scripture, and the exact fulfilment of pro∣phecy.</P>
<P>Thus, as <HI>Sodom</HI> cannot be restored in her pos∣terity; there being none remaining on earth; nei∣ther shall the Dead Sea be turned into land, in the Millenium; it follows, as the only remaining sense of the return of <HI>Sodom's</HI> captivity, that those ve∣ry inhabitants, who were destroyed by fire and brimstone from heaven, shall be restored to a state of felicity: And thus, both the doctrine of <HI>anni∣hilation</HI> and <HI>endless damnation</HI> fall to the ground at once.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>But as it is the second death, after the day of judgment, that is to destroy the bodies and souls of the wicked in hell; perhaps, the inhabit∣ants of <HI>Sodom, Samaria,</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> may be re∣stored before that period, and may not be cast into the lake of fire.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>It is evident by our <HI>Saviour's</HI> words, (for we must not contradict any part of the Scrip∣tures) that this will not be the case: for he saith, That it shall be more tolerable for the land (<HI>that is,</HI> the inhabitants) of <HI>Sodom,</HI> in the day of judgment,
<PB N="204" REF="025050_0260_102D74B91B71E8D0"/>
than for the cities where his gospel was preached, and his miracles wrought, and yet the inhabitants remained impenitent: See St. Matth. xi. 24. x. 15. St. Mark, vi. 11. St. Luke, x. 12. From all which passages it is evident, that the inhabitants of <HI>Sodom</HI> will be condemned in the day of judgment, and punished in the lake of fire; and though their mi∣sery will not be so great as that of the inhabitants of the cities where our Saviour preached, and per∣formed his mighty works; yet they will be misera∣ble in that day: and, consequently, the return of their captivity is not to be expected, till after the creation of the new earth. Therefore, it is plain, that the lake of fire is not designed to annihilate those who are cast therein; since all that are not found written in the book of life, at the day of judgment, will be cast into the lake of fire. They whose names are in the book of life, will be happy. The inhabitants of <HI>Sodom</HI> will be miserable, in some degree; therefore, will not be found written in the book of life; consequently, will be cast into the lake of fire. They will be restored; their captivity shall be returned: therefore the lake of fire shall not annihilate them. They are set forth for an example in their punishment; and conse∣quently, in their Restoration.—I need not pursue this argument farther: It appears evident to me; and, till it be fairly answered, I shall add nothing more.</P>

<P>Yes, I have frequently heard it men∣tioned, but as it appears totally void of all foun∣dation in the Scripture, it hardly deserves any no∣tice. The objections that I feel myself concerned to treat with seriousness and respect, and candidly to answer, are those which appear to be drawn from the book of divine Revelation; but if I must attend to all those which the ingenuity of men might raise against the doctrine of the Restoration, I should not only have a very hard task, but should never know when I had done, and besides the dis∣course would dwindle into trifling and conjectures, very unsuitable to the nature and importance of such an awful serious subject. I must observe, that this objection is nothing but a rash unground∣ed assertion, or bold conjecture, without the least foundation either in Scripture or reason, and if I was to assert just the contrary, I cannot see why my assertion would not be a sufficient answer. Ne∣vertheless, lest it should be thought that any ob∣jection can be raised, that cannot be fairly answer∣ed, and that I knowing the strength of this, would willingly evade it, I will say a few words upon it. The Scriptures universally hold forth the idea, that men will be judged, condemned, and punished ac∣cording to the deeds done in the body. God will render to every man according to his deeds,' Rom. ii. 6. 'For we must all appear before the judg∣ment seat of Christ, that every one may receive
<PB N="206" REF="025050_0262_102D74BAF9CA0588"/>
the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,' 2 Cor. v. 10.</P>
<P>'And that servant which knew his Lord's will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes: but he that knew not, and did commit things worthy of stripes, shall be beaten with few stripes,' St. Luke, xii. 47, 48. These, and all the passages that speak of future punishment, constantly hold it forth as a just retribution for the evil deeds done in this life; but never intimate any thing of what this ob∣jection holds forth, of punishment being continued <HI>ad infinitum</HI> for crimes committed hereafter. Be∣sides, it is plain that punishments or corrections are intended to stop men from sinning, and under the divine agency to take away their sins. 'By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purg∣ed; and this is all the fruit to take away his sin,' Isai. xxvii. 9. This is universally allowed to be the design of troubles and sorrows in the present life, and why not in the next state also? the Scripture says nothing to forbid this idea, but much to en∣courage it; particularly that awful passage where the prophet says, 'And it was revealed in mine ears by JEHOVAH of Hosts, Surely this iniquity shall not be purged from you, TILL YE DIE, saith the Lord God of hosts,' Isai. xxii. 14. If then iniquity shall be purged away after death, it is certain that men shall not always continue to sin in a future state, for they must cease to commit ini∣quity, before it can be purged away. And though their punishments may at first cause them to rage, (as we see is frequently the case in this world) yet shall they continue un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he most stubborn shall be entirely subdued and humbled.</P>

<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is another argument of this same kind, viz. that is not founded upon any particular text of Scripture, which is directly contrary to the one you have been answering, which I have formerly thought unanswerable in favour of the doctrine of endless punishment, which is the <HI>infi∣nity</HI> of sin, being against an infinite object, con∣taining infinite hatefulness, and justly therefore deserving infinite punishment. Sin is a crime of infinite magnitude, because God is a Being of in∣finite majesty and perfection. Every crime justly demerits punishment proportioned to its malignity! and consequently every offence against God deme∣rits infinite punishment. No mere creature can ever suffer an infinity of punishment in any limited duration. It follows therefore, that a sinner de∣serves to be <HI>eternally</HI> punished. Farther, every man is under infinite obligations to devote him∣self to the service of God, his infinitely glo∣rious Creator, Preserver and Benefactor. To violate an infinite obligation, is to commit a crime of infinite malignity. A crime of infinite malignity, deserves infinite punishment. Can it ever be proved then that everlasting, or <HI>endless pu∣nishment</HI> is not the proper desert of a life of sin? I have often said, That this argument trite and common as it is, never was, nor ever would be fairly answered; nevertheless, I am willing to hear what you have to say upon it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>As this argument is often urged, as of the greatest weight, and as you have stated it in its greatest possible force, I shall endeavour to answer it fairly, and particularly.</P>
<P>If sin is <HI>infinite,</HI> then we must ascribe to it one of the perfections of the Deity, which strikes me as something absurd, if not something worse: <HI>sin,</HI>
<PB N="208" REF="025050_0264_102D74BC9A2E1E30"/>
a <HI>privation,</HI> an <HI>act of a worm, infinite?</HI> Actions must, in my opinion take their denomination from the actors, and not from the objects. Infinite actions, or actions of infinite magnitude require infinite power to perform them. If sin is of in∣finite magnitude, goodness it more so, as deriving a power from God to the performance of it. But if you grant that David spoke in the name of the Mediator in Psalm xvi. you may be at once furnish∣ed with a proof, that even goodness, in the high∣est state in which it ever was exhibited in the world, was not considered as of infinite magni∣tude by the great performer. 'Thou hast said unto <HI>Jehovah,</HI> Thou art my Lord: my goodness extendeth not to thee. But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight,' Ver. 2, 3. If acts of goodness were of infinite magnitude they must extend to God, but the speaker, in these words, be he who he may, David or Christ, was careful to let us know that he did not conceive his acts of goodness infinite. And if acts of goodness are not infinite, it would be highly absurd to call evil actions infinite, which proceed wholly from the creature.</P>
<P>I grant indeed that there is a passage of Scrip∣ture which mentions the word <HI>infinite</HI> as belonging to sin and iniquity, but then it is mentioned in such a connection as shews it to be used as Jose∣phus frequently mentions it, for a very great mul∣titude. And t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us it is used by many good authors, who certainly do not mean to use it in the first and proper sense of the word. The Sacred Writer, in the passage alluded to, takes particular care to guard us against any such idea, as though sin was
<PB N="209" REF="025050_0265_102D7119BA99A9C8"/>
of infinite magnitude, or even virtuous and righte∣ous actions, which approach far nearer to infini∣ty, as having their source from the fountain of in∣finite goodness. For Eliphaz says, 'Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be profitable unto himself? Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous? or is it gain to him that thou makest thy ways perfect? Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? Will he enter with thee into judgment? Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?' Job xxii. 2—5. And language very similar to the above is used by Elihu, 'If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy transgressions be multiplied, what dost thou unto him? If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth he of thine hand? Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art, and thy righteousness may profit the son of man,' Job xxxv. 6, 7, 8.</P>
<P>These expressions, if they teach any thing, I should think expressly declare, that no actions of men can by any means be of <HI>infinite</HI> magnitude, in the sense in which we commonly understand that word; though their numbers and magnitudes may be so great as to be stiled <HI>infinite,</HI> as the word is sometimes used.</P>
<P>You assert, in consequence of your ideas of <HI>in∣finite</HI> sin, that <HI>every</HI> offence against God demerits infinite punishment. If the case be so, does it not tend entirely to take away the distinction which God hath made between sins of infirmity and sins of malice, sins of ignorance and sins of wilfulness, lesser and greater sins? All sins are offences against God, and if <HI>every</HI> offence against God is of <HI>infinite magnitude,</HI> how can any be greater? and thus the
<PB N="210" REF="025050_0266_102D74C060A17848"/>
distinctions are entirely destroyed, and, all sins will be esteemed equal, contrary to the whole tenor of the Scriptures.</P>
<P>If every offence against God demerits infinite punishment, then it will follow, that God cannot render to any according to their ways, nor punish them as their iniquities deserve, unless they are doomed to <HI>endless misery;</HI> what then will become of all those threatenings where God threatens to punish people for all their iniquities, and yet to shew favour to them afterwards? This is impossi∣ble upon your plan, for none can ever receive all the punishment due to their sins during numberless ages. Yet if the word of God be true, he can deal with transgressors as they have done, and yet be gracious to them afterwards, 'For thus saith Adonai JEHOVAH, I will even deal with thee as thou hast done, which hast despised the oath in breaking the covenant. Nevertheless, I will re∣member my covenant with thee in the days of thy youth, and I will establish unto thee an everlasting covenant.—That thou mayest remember and be confounded, and never open thy mouth any more because of thy shame, when I am pacified towards thee for all that thou hast done, saith Adonai JE∣HOVAH,' Ezek. xvi. 59, 60, 63.</P>
<P>Here is an instance to the purpose, of those whose sins were of the deepest die, and to whom God threatens to deal as they had done, and to punish them for all their numerous and aggravated transgressions, and yet to remember mercy for them afterwards, and to be pacified towards them for all that they had done. All which things would be absolutely impossible, according to your ideas. In many other parts of Scripture God promises to
<PB N="211" REF="025050_0267_102D74BED0AC5F20"/>
render to transgressors according to their works and ways, and ye<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be afterwards gracious unto them. And in one place, at least, where God is declaring the great mercies which he will manifest unto the children of Israel, in returning them to their own land, and causing them to dwell safely therein, he says, 'And first, I will recompense their iniquity, and their sin <HI>double:</HI> because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inherit∣ance with the carcases of their detestable and abo∣minable things,' Jer. xvi. 18. What do you think of this? If every offence is of infinite magnitude, and deserves infinite punishment, which can never be fully executed, then how can God punish a people for <HI>all</HI> their iniquiti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, and <HI>do</HI> to the greatest sinners <HI>as</HI> they have <HI>done,</HI> yea, and recompence their iniquity, and their sin <HI>double</HI> first, and then be gracious to them, and love them, and be paci∣fied towards them afterwards? And the prophet Isaiah says, 'Comfort ye, comfort ye, my people, saith your God. Speak ye comfortably to Jeru∣salem, and cry unto her, that her warfare is accom∣plished, that her iniquity is pardoned; for she hath received of the LORD'S hand DOUBLE FOR ALL HER SINS,' Isai. xl. 1, 2. Here a fact is said to be accomplished, which upon your scheme can ne∣ver be done to all <HI>eternity;</HI> for if every offence against God is of infinite magnitude, and de∣serves infinite punishment, none can ever have re∣ceived <HI>single</HI> for <HI>one</HI> of their <HI>sins,</HI> far less DOUBLE for ALL.</P>
<P>And therefore nothing can possibly be more evidently contrary to Scripture than your trite and common argument, that as, every sin is of infi∣nite magnitude, so it justly demerits infinite pu∣nishment,
<PB N="212" REF="025050_0268_102D74C23AA0D9A0"/>
which as no mere creature can bear, must necessarily subject all who are recompensed according to their own doings to <HI>endless</HI> misery.</P>
<P>Besides, If I was to grant you, contrary to Scripture, reason, and common sense, that every offence is of infinite magnitude, and naturally deserves infinite punishment: How would you prove from <HI>that</HI> the certainty of <HI>endless misery?</HI> Do you make nothing of the reconciliation which our Lord Jesus has made for <HI>all sinners,</HI> and for <HI>all sins?</HI></P>
<P>Let me ask you seriously, Did not Christ make a full and complete offering and propitiation for the sins of the whole world? Is it not certain that his merits were far greater than the demerits of all mankind? Is he not the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world? If Christ died for all men, without exception, as you grant, and removed all their iniquities, and bore them away, and reconciled all to God by his death while they were enemies: much more as he has paid so great a price for their ransom, he will recover them out of their lost estate, and save them by his life. 'Where sin abounded, grace did (or shall) much more abound. That as sin hath reigned unto death, even so might grace reign through righteousness unto eternal life, by Jesus Christ our Lord,' Rom. v. 20, 21.</P>
<P>I conclude, that let sin be ever so great, the grace of God is greater: and if you will have it that sin is of <HI>infinite magnitude,</HI> I hope you will not deny the propitiation of Jesus Christ, which he made for all sins, the same character. There∣fore if you magnify sin, and insist upon the great∣ness of its demerit, I will endeavour to magnify
<PB N="213" REF="025050_0269_102D74D92895ADD0"/>
the all powerful Redeemer above it, and speak of his power to redeem all the human race, for whom he shed his blood. And then you will gain no∣thing in favour of the doctrine of endless damna∣tion, by all your arguments founded upon the <HI>infinity</HI> of sin: Christ being far more infinite to save, than sin can be to destroy: and as he has undertaken to redeem and bring back those who were lost, there is no danger of his failing to per∣form it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Friend.</SPEAKER>
<P>I must confess that what you have said on this head entirely convinces me, that we can∣not found the <HI>eternity</HI> of punishment, upon the <HI>infinity</HI> of sin; and you have given me more sa∣tisfaction upon many points in these conversations than I ever expected to receive. I am indeed at length almost persuaded to receive your sentiments, though I once thought that it was impossible to answer all my objections, yet you have gone far towards it. Nay, I cannot at present recollect any thing material, but what you have answered. I would not however be too hasty in adopting this system, but after your example consider it well. But there is certainly something more grand, beau∣tiful, and harmonious in this view than can be found in any other scheme; for both the other systems end in darkness and black night, one in <HI>endless damnation,</HI> and the other in <HI>gloomy annihila∣tion.</HI> But on your plan light rises out or obscurity, and a glorious day succeeds the darkest scenes. This view of things sets the Book of divine Reve∣lation in the most pleasing light, and appears, for aught any thing that I can see, consistent with the Divine perfections. But why, since you believe the universal Restoration, do you not men∣tion
<PB N="214" REF="025050_0270_102D74C40F1D08A8"/>
it more freely and fully, in your public dis∣courses?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Minister.</SPEAKER>
<P>On the other hand, some ask me, Why do you ever mention it at all in your sermons; since it is not essential to salvation to believe it? To them I give these answers.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. St. Paul declared to Timothy, that this uni∣versal Gospel of God's being the Saviour, or Re∣storer, of all men, but especially of those that be∣lieve, was a faithful saying, and worthy of all ac∣ceptation; and that they laboured and suffered re∣proach, because they trusted in God, as the univer∣sal Saviour. But he was so far from being asham∣ed of this belief, that he said to Timothy, 'These things command and teach,' 1 Tim. iv. 9, 10, 11. And so am I determined to do, at proper opportu∣nities; notwithstanding the reproach and contempt awaiting me for so doing.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Though it is frequently said to be a matter of little or no consequence, if true; yet, if it be any part of the record God hath given of his Son, (as I think I have proved) we are in danger of making him a liar, if we believe it not: See 1 John v. 9, 10, 11.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Though you may be Christians, and not be∣lieve it; yet I cannot; though once I could also: But now the evidences of its truth appear so plain to my mind, that it would be criminal in me not to believe it; and since I do believe it, would it not be highly dishonest in me to deny it? I have never done so yet, when asked; and God forbid, that I should be ashamed to publish, what he has commanded to be made known.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. I have commonly acted merely on the defen∣sive, and I never should, that I know of, have
<PB N="215" REF="025050_0271_102D74DB0EE49F40"/>
preached it in public, or but rarely, far less have written upon the subject, had it not been repre∣sented as a dangerous and destructive heresy; and people been cautioned against hearing me, on that account.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. I have been frequently desired to preach upon the subject, expressly; and could not well refuse, without betraying a cowardly disposition.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. I ask, Who is the best man; he who preaches the truth contrary to his judgment, for interest, or to gain applause; or he that fairly speaks as he thinks, without disguise; although he knows that it will displease his best friends on earth; even up∣on the supposition that he errs, in many points? If there be an heretic in the world, it is the man, who, for the love of money or applause, or through the fear of man, preaches that to others which he himself doth not believe. 'He that is such, is sub∣verted, and sinneth; being condemned of himself,' Tit. iii. 11.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. If we are to hold forth nothing to mankind, but what all are agreed in, we must discourse upon very few subjects: for I do not recollect so much as one, but what people either disagree about the thing itself, or the manner of explaining and hold∣ing it: No! not even the being and perfections of God: nor any point of doctrinal, experimental, or even practical religion.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. We are to endeavour to teach mankind what they know not, as well as to confirm them in what they are already taught; should keep back nothing that may be profitable to them; should give meat to strong men, as well as milk to babes, and should not shun to declare the <HI>whole</HI> counsel of God. We ought to justify the ways of God to men, to shew
<PB N="216" REF="025050_0272_102D74C6084B8CE8"/>
the necessity and harmony of Divine Revelation, and take pains to convert infidels; all which things are more promoted by this view than any other.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>As to your question, why I do not dwell more upon it? I answer:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. There are a thousand other subjects in the Bi∣ble, besides this; and all deserve consideration, ac∣cording to their weight and importance.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I have an utter aversion to going always in the same round of matter or manner; and, therefore I frequently vary in both.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. There are many other subjects of more pre∣sent importance than the belief of this; such as, re∣pentance, faith, hope, love, obedience, &amp;c. and therefore ought to be more frequently insisted on, in proportion to their present use.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. There are many scenes of providence and grace to take place in the universe, before the ge∣neral Restoration; such as the Millenium, the call∣ing of the Jews, the universal spread of the gos∣pel through the earth, &amp;c. These things are much nearer, and therefore the Scripture speaks more of them; and what God most speaks of, in his word, we should discourse of most to the people.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. This doctrine, though it may have its use in converting men; and certainly enables those who believe it, to set forth the terrors of the Lord, and his mercies, in a more striking manner than other∣wise they could; yet it is chiefly useful in com∣forting the people of God, and, in part, relieving them from that bitter anguish which their tender minds feel, from the consideration of the vast num∣bers that perish; and, therefore, may not be so
<PB N="217" REF="025050_0273_102D74DD4A52B340"/>
proper for a popular audience as many other sub∣jects.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. The plan of this grand Restoration is so vast, includes so many different and seemingly contradictory dispensations, that it cannot be fairly stated, and fully defended, in one sermon, and especially the objections answered; and many per∣sons are not capable of taking in and digesting at once, so many subjects as are necessary to the un∣derstanding of this matter, and have not patience to attend to a long series of demonstrations, argu∣ments, and proofs; and, therefore, this doctrine should not be introduced by any man, in any place, unless he has opportunity to give it a fair investi∣gation; and, therefore, I never mention it at all, at my first preaching in any place; nor unless I have sufficient opportunities to discuss it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. <HI>Christ</HI> says to his disciples—'I have yet many things to say unto you; but ye cannot bear them now,' St. John xvi. 12. And St. Paul says—'And I, brethren, could not speak unto you as unto spi∣ritual, but as unto carnal; even as unto babes in <HI>Christ:</HI> I have fed you with milk, and not with meat; for hitherto ye were not able to bear it; neither yet now are ye able,' 1 Cor. iii. 1, 2. 'Strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age; even those who, by reason of use, have their senses exercised, to discern both good and evil,' Heb. v. 14. Therefore, as the Saviour and his apostles adapted their subjects and discourses to the circumstances of their hearers, and treated them in a gentle manner; so should we. Prudence, pa∣tience, and care, should always be used in dis∣coursing on a doctrine so deep and awful as this;
<PB N="218" REF="025050_0274_102D74C7D9C077E0"/>
and, especially, as it hath been so little known of late ages.</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. I would wish to establish well the first prin∣ciples of Christianity, before I meddle with any thing else: and as to the doctrine of the Restora∣tion, I would rather that it should seem to be na∣turally inferred from truths already known, than delivered as an independent system: I, therefore, seldom or ever make it a leading point in my dis∣courses; but sometimes lead to it, as a natural consequence of what has been said. After all, I would chuse that men should discover it themselves, by carefully reading the Scriptures, without pre∣judice, believing them to be strictly true: by liv∣ing in love towards God and man; by walking in humility, often reflecting on their former estate; and constantly viewing the sufficiency of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the boundless love of their great Creator: rather than to learn it of any man, far less still, of such an unworthy worm as I am.</ITEM>
<ITEM>9. As far as I know my own heart, truth, in love, is my constant aim. I am unconnected with any party; and am not so prejudiced in favour of any thing that I hold, but that I would willingly be convinced in any thing, by proper evidence; and when so convinced, I am ready to retract pub∣lickly: As, therefore, I do not feel myself person∣ally interested to support the system, right or wrong; I have, therefore, dwelt much less upon it, than most preachers do upon their particular sentiments.</ITEM>
<ITEM>10. When I first embraced these views, I was obliged to give some account of my reasons; and I chose rather to do it by writing than preaching: Accordingly, I published my sentiments, and an∣swers
<PB N="219" REF="025050_0275_102D74DED87A4BE0"/>
to many objections; which publications be∣ing in the hands of those to whom I preached, made it less necessary for me to discourse upon those matters in public, or even in private, as I could refer to what I had written: and with the same view, I am inclined to publish these familiar discourses, which we have had together; after which it will be less necessary than ever for me to preach the Restoration publicly; yet, I will not wholly avoid it, at convenient times, and in pro∣per circumstances.</ITEM>
<ITEM>11. Lastly, as I know so much of the nature of man, as to be sensible that he turns, with dis∣gust and loathing, from what is perpetually cram∣med down his throat; but relishes that which he falls upon, as it were accidentally, and comes into by little and little: I have always made it a rule never to introduce it, in public or private, unless where it was earnestly desired, nor ever to continue it long together; and, above all, never to question people upon the subject, after discoursing upon it: asking them, saying, Do you believe it? &amp;c. Nor would I ever wish to press them with the argu∣ments at once, and oblige them immediately to yield; as this kind of conduct, so far from answer∣ing any good purposes, commonly sets them against what is thus intruded upon them. It is the best way to give time and leisure to persons, whom you would wish to convince; and let them exer∣cise their own faculties.</ITEM>
