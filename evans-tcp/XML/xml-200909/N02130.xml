<HEAD>The <HI>Ruling</HI> and <HI>Ordaining</HI> POWER OF PRESBYTERS, DEFENDED In a LETTER, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> Now return the <HI>Book</HI> you were pleas'd, the last Week, to leave with me; and together with Thanks, I send you my <HI>Re∣marks,</HI> upon some Part of it, in compliance to your Desires. Upon perusal of the Book, I find the main Body of it is in defence of <HI>Forms of Prayer,</HI> &amp; the <HI>English Liturgy;</HI> which being Things that have not so immediate Reference to the Controversy now o'foot among us, I think it best at present to pass them over, and to confine my self intirely within those Pages that relate to EPISCOPACY. I remember your Proposal was, that this Reply to Mr. <HI>Bar∣clay</HI> shou'd be manag'd so as to serve for an <HI>Ap∣pendix</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="002531_0003_0FDB5BC6FA15E750"/>
to the late Letter of <HI>Sober Remarks</HI> on the <HI>Modest Proof;</HI> which put the Dispute wholly on a <HI>Scripture-Fost.</HI> For this Reason, although what my Author has offer'd from the <HI>Fathers,</HI> would admit of an easy Answer, yet I will take little or no notice of his Testimonies from Them; but shall limit my self to the Arguments he pre∣tends to draw out of the BIBLE; which a famous <HI>Episcopalian</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Chillingw.</NOTE> well calls the <HI>Religion of Protestants.</HI> And here I don't intend to make Observations upon every little thing liable to Ex∣ception in my Author: and as to Things Mate∣terial, which I find have receiv'd a just Answer in the Letter of <HI>Sober Remarks,</HI> I design but briefly to touch upon 'em: unless perhaps some <HI>new</HI> Thoughts may occur to me, proper to be added; which the Writer of that Letter did not see fit to take any Notice of.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI>'s Discourse, which is now to come under Examination, begins at the 78th Page of his Book. Where, in the first place, he lays down this, Proposition, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>"THAT the Government of</HI> CHRIST's <HI>Church was left by himself, and manag'd for the first Three Centuries by some Gospel Ministers of the Word and Sacraments, exercising Authority and Jurisdiction over others, who were <HI>Likewise</HI> Ministers of the Word and Sacraments".</HI></P>
<P>HERE not to take notice of any Solecisms in Grammar, or any thing else lyable to Exception, in the Proposition it self, I will come im∣mediately to consider the Arguments he brings to support this Assertion.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002531_0004_0FDB5BC95B55A670"/>IN the first place, I find him harping on the old thread-bare Argument from the 12 and the 70. Though here he seems to yield to Presby∣terians the Dispute about the Superiority of the 12 to the 70, during our Savior's Life-time. At least, (he says to us, <HI>to take you in your own way;</HI> a Phrase I shall have frequent occasion to borrow from him) he will for once <HI>suppose</HI> that they were <HI>equal.</HI> But then he adds, pag. 79. <Q>If we can find a <HI>Second Superior Ordination</HI> given by our Savior to the <HI>Eleven,</HI> which the <HI>Seventy</HI> did not receive. I hope it will appear that the <HI>Eleven</HI> were of a <HI>higher Order,</HI> and had a greater Degree of Power in the Church than They.</Q> Now to evidence this, he turns us to <HI>Job.</HI> 20.21. <HI>As my Father hath sent me, so send I you,</HI> &amp;c: which (he judges) <Q>doth imply a <HI>new Commission,</HI> vest∣ing the Eleven Apostles with the Power of <HI>Ordination,</HI> or of sending others; for (he argues) unless CHRIST gave 'em that Power, he did not send them <HI>as his Father sent him.</HI></Q>
Here I might observe, There are other and better Interpretations of this Text; but being willing to take the Gentleman in his own way, I will for once suppose his Construction to be the best and truest: yet of what Service it will be to him, in the present Argument, I cannot imagin. Surely 'tis a wild Conclusion he draws, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>Then it is evident, that our Savior left his Church with a Set of Gospel-Ministers vested with <HI>different</HI> degrees of Power and Authority.</Q> For this Inference is grounded on a false Hypothesis, <HI>viz.</HI> That CHRIST at his Ascension left <HI>other</HI> Mi∣nisters in Commission besides the <HI>Eleven;</HI> which is a point he has not said one word to prove:
<PB N="4" REF="002531_0005_0FDB5BCBA3DF9FD0"/>
Certainly this Gentleman must have a fine Talent in Controversy; since he has taken so much pains to prove what no body denies, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Eleven were vested with a power of Ordination; and then has taken for granted one of the main Things in Question, <HI>viz.</HI> The Continuance of the Seventy in Office in the Church. All Anti-Pre∣latists agree with him in asserting the former, but not the latter. We unanimously affirm the <HI>Tem∣poreity</HI> of the Seventy. If then the Gentle∣man wou'd have (as he promis'd to do) taken us in our own way, He shou'd have suppos'd this; and this notwithstanding, prov'd an <HI>Imparity</HI> of order among Gospel-Ministers. Now that He might well suppose (with us) the 70 to be tem∣porary, every one I believe will readily grant, who reads impartially what is said on this Sub∣ject in the <HI>Sober Remarks</HI> (Edit. 2. <HI>Pag.</HI> 29. &amp;c.) So that I need say nothing on it here. But he silently slides over this, as if it were a point not disputed, or were foreign to the Argu∣ment; when he knows it is a matter of Debate, and that not a little depends upon it. For, if the Commission of the Seventy was but tempo∣rary, and not renew'd after CHRIST's Resurrection, then He left only one Order of Gospel-Ministers, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Eleven;</HI> and those vested with equal Power of Ordination and Jurisdiction, by the new Commission they receiv'd at His Ascending.</P>
<P>WE may safely therefore grant our Author, <Q>That the <HI>Eleven Apostles</HI> receiv'd a Power by this last Commission, which they had not be∣fore, and which none of the <HI>Seventy</HI> did <HI>then</HI> receive: and yet it will not follow from hence, That our Savior left his Church with a Set of
<PB N="5" REF="002531_0006_0FDB5BCF4E224558"/>
Gospel-Ministers vested with <HI>different</HI> degrees of Power and Authority.</Q></P>
<P>HOWEVER, to take this Gentleman in his own way, I will for once suppose the Commission of the <HI>Seventy</HI> (recorded <HI>Luk.</HI> 10.) was not temporary, but standing and perpetual: yet this will not certainly infer the Divine Appointment of two different Orders of Gospel-Ministers, in the <HI>Gentile</HI> Churches, with whom it is we are con∣cerned. For (as it is argu'd in the <HI>Sober Re∣marks,</HI> pag. 31, 32.) the Commission of the Se∣venty was confined to the <HI>Circumcision;</HI> and we never read of its being extended by CHRIST, to the <HI>Uncircumcision.</HI> It is of no Obligation then upon the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Supposing it did continue, &amp; was obligatory to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Christians; yet the <HI>Gentile</HI> Churches are not at all concerned with it. Whether therefore that Commission was temporary, or whether it was standing, it is alike incapable of serving this Gentleman's Purpose.</P>
<P>BUT now leaving the Commissions, He comes to argue from FACT, Pag. 80. Where He tells us, <Q>The <HI>Apostles</HI> did <HI>(de facto)</HI> exercise <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> over all other <HI>Gospel-Ministers</HI> in their Time.</Q>— This I will for once suppose to be true; for I'm willing still to take the Gentleman in his own way: but yet I believe, It will not afford any Argument for Diocesan Bishops, if we consider things impartially.</P>
<P>HE tells us, The Apostles exercised Authori∣ty over the Rest of the Gospel-Ministers, <HI>In making Laws.</HI> What then? Do's this argue, that there must be a standing Order in the Church to make Laws, and prescribe Rules to Ministers? No, by no means. The Church was in its <HI>Infant-State</HI> then, and the Canon of <HI>Scripture</HI> not per∣fected;
<PB N="6" REF="002531_0007_0FDB5BD2589E5E40"/>
the Apostles were therefore extraordi¦narily inspir'd, to reveal the Mind and Will of CHRIST, unto his People and Ministers <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Sober Remarks,</HI> pag. 33. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Edit. 2.</NOTE>. But, as there is no need of any such infallible Guides now, since the Canon of the New Testament is completed; So, that the Apostles, who were di∣vinely inspir'd, and under an infallible Conduct, did prescribe Rules and Laws to Churches and Pastors, This certainly is no Warrant, to Men not so qualify'd, to presume to do the same thing, 'Tis not a <HI>Legislative,</HI> but an <HI>Executive</HI> Power, that belongs to the ordinary Governors of the Church. They have Authority only to execute the Laws of CHRIST, contained in the Holy Scriptures. And I know of no Laws or Orders there, but what ordinary Pastors have the Execu∣tion of, committed to them.</P>
<P>Again, HE tells us, <Q>The Apostles Authority over other Ministers appears from their <HI>Or∣daining to Ministerial Offices:</HI> which work (he says) was always perform'd by <HI>Them.</HI></Q></P>
<P>TO prove this, He observes to us, in the first place, That the <HI>Apostles</HI> ordain'd the <HI>Deacons,</HI> Act. 6.</P>
<P>I answer; Good Reason there was, that they should do it. The Apostles were the only proper Persons to perform that first Ordination; for it was an appointing a <HI>New Office</HI> in the Church, which none else had Power to do, and unto which (no doubt) they were directed by the Holy Ghost. If any then will infer from this Instance, that Bishops only have Power to ordain Deacons; they may as colourably argue from it, That Bishops have Power to institute <HI>new</HI> Officers &amp; Ministries in the Church.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002531_0008_0FDB5BD80A451AC8"/>AGAIN, The Gentleman observes to us; <Q>That St. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> ordain'd <HI>Elders</HI> in every City, (<HI>Church,</HI> it should be.) <HI>Act.</HI> 14.23.</Q> To which I'll reply, in the Words of Another "Good Reason why; Because They were new Churches that had no Ministers in them till constituted by the Apostles. Presbyters cou'd not ordain before they had a Being. Besides by the way, it may be observ'd: "They ordain'd <HI>Presbyters;</HI> not Diocesan Bishops. 'Tis evident from this In∣stance, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> left the Churches under the Government of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> without <HI>Supe∣rior Bishops.</HI> How came the Apostles not to or∣dain such Bishops in every Church! If they had been necessary, doubtless they wou'd have done it".</P>
<P>BUT further, The Gentleman observes, <Q>There is one Instance, from which this Apostolical Superiority appears plainly; for when <HI>Philip</HI> baptis'd the Converts in <HI>Samaria Act.</HI> 8.12. Yet they could receive no <HI>Imposition of Hands</HI> from him: but the Apostles at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> sent St. <HI>Peter,</HI> and St. <HI>John</HI> to <HI>lay hands on them;</HI> that is, for Confirmation and <HI>Ordination.</HI></Q> To which I answer; His Argument is lost, if he has mistaken the <HI>Design</HI> of that Imposition of Hands. And it seems he has done so. For it is highly probable, 'Twas only for <HI>conferring the extraordi∣nary Gifts of the Holy Ghost;</HI> which was a Power and Honour peculiar to the <HI>Apostles.</HI> (See <HI>Act.</HI> 8.15, 18.) That this was the <HI>Primary</HI> End, at least, we have the general Concurrence of the best Expositors. And if this was the End, it is what was not only out of <HI>Philip</HI>'s power, but out of Bishop <HI>Timothy</HI>'s too; and had <HI>He</HI> been at <HI>Sa∣maria</HI> then, there would have been the same Oc∣casion
<PB N="8" REF="002531_0009_0FDB5BD916A58FC8"/>
to send down the <HI>Apostles</HI> thither.—How∣ever, to take the Gentleman in his own way, I will for once suppose, that this Imposition of Hands immediately and only refer'd to <HI>Confirma∣tion</HI> and <HI>Ordination:</HI> yet I do not see how <HI>Philip</HI>'s not being capable of performing these works, can afford any Argument to his purpose: for, accord∣ing to him, <HI>Philip</HI> at that time was but a <HI>Deacon;</HI> and a Deacon's being incapable, is no Argument that a <HI>Presbyter</HI> (an higher Officer) must be so too. To make his Reasoning here any thing tolerable. He must allow <HI>Philip</HI> was a Presbyter: but then the mischief is, This will be to contra∣dict himself; since he expresly calls him a Dea∣con, (<HI>pag.</HI> 93.) and it will unhappily overthrow his great Plea there, [from the Instance of <HI>Philip</HI>] for <HI>Preaching</HI> &amp; <HI>Baptising</HI> Deacons.</P>
<P>IN the next place, The Gentleman observes. <Q>It is <HI>Objected,</HI> That mere Presbyters ordain'd St. <HI>Timothy▪</HI> from 1 Tim. 4.14. <HI>The laying on of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Presbytery.</HI> But (says he) this Text does not at all prove that <HI>Presbyters</HI> (in <HI>our</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Word) ordain'd <HI>Timothy.</HI></Q>
I reply, We don't pretend it do's. For we know of no Ministers in <HI>Scripture,</HI> that were Presbyters, in the modern (<HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI>) sense of the Word. We deny any such Officer in the Church, us a <HI>mere Presbyter,</HI> that is, a Minister of the Word, destitute of Episcopal Power over the Flock. The Elders, or Presbyters, we read of, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.1. were <HI>Bishops.</HI> Such Bishops we are For, and such Elders; but we know of no Institu∣tion for Elders that do not rule over the Flock, or for Bishops that rule over Elders. We are for Congregational Bishops; and such we conclude,
<PB N="9" REF="002531_0010_0FDB5BDAA9FE2328"/>
were the Presbyters that ordain'd <HI>Timothy.</HI>—But the Gentleman adds, <Q>If mere Presbyters did lay hands on him, it was only in <HI>Conjunction</HI> with St. <HI>Paul:</HI> for he says expresly, (2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6.) that <HI>Timothy</HI> was ordain'd <HI>by the laying on of</HI> His <HI>Hands.</HI></Q></P>
<P>NOW to this I reply.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE Imposition of <HI>Paul</HI>'s Hands might be at a <HI>different Time,</HI> and upon some other Occa∣sion.</P>
<P>IT is most probable, <HI>Paul</HI>'s laying on of Hands was not for the ordination of <HI>Timothy</HI> to any Office, but only for conferring the extraordinary Gifts of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> upon him. This might be the whole Design, for ought that appears to the Contrary; and so <HI>Paul</HI> might have no hand at all in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination. But that might be done by ordinary <HI>Presbyters</HI> at some other Time; as <HI>Paul</HI> himself, who receiv'd his sight by the laying on of the Hands of <HI>Ananias,</HI> &amp; was filled with the Holy Ghost, yet afterwards was separated to his Ministry among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> by the laying on of the Hands of <HI>certain Prophets and Teachers,</HI> or Presbyters, at <HI>Antioch.</HI> (Act. 13.1, 2, 3.)</P>
<P>BUT I would again take the Gentleman in his own way, and therefore will for once suppose, That <HI>Paul</HI>'s laying on of Hands was for <HI>Timothy</HI>'s <HI>Ordination;</HI> yet it is possible it might not be in <HI>Conjunction</HI> with the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> but at a dis∣tinct Time, if what our Opponents plead for, was then practis'd, <HI>viz. Reordination.</HI> How knows this Gentleman but that <HI>Timothy</HI> might be ordain'd first a <HI>Presbyter</HI> by the <HI>Presbytery</HI> alone, and after∣wards a <HI>Bishop</HI> by <HI>Paul</HI> only. Some of his Bre∣thren I know seem to be of this Mind. Well
<PB N="10" REF="002531_0011_0FDB5BDE234E9AD0"/>
for once suppose this was the Case; so much then at least follows, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> have power to ordain Presbyters: and this is all we at pre∣sent demand. As for <HI>Diocesan</HI> Bishops, &amp; their <HI>Consecration,</HI> we will contentedly leave our Opponents to enjoy their Opinion about 'em; if we may but enjoy ours without Disturbance.</P>
<P>BUT now to come closer to our Author,—</P>
<P N="2">2. I will for once suppose, that <HI>Paul</HI>'s laying on of hands, and the <HI>Presbytery</HI>'s, were both at the <HI>same Time,</HI> and in <HI>Conjunction;</HI> yet I can't see how this Concession will give him any Ad∣vantage. The Gentleman observes, <Q>If <HI>Presby∣ters</HI> did lay on hands in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination, it was <HI>only</HI> in Conjunction with St. <HI>Paul, [yes
verily, and if St.</HI> Paul <HI>lay'd on hands, it was only in Conjunction with the</HI> Presbytery] And so is agreable to our Practice at this day, as may be seen in the Rubrick of the Office for ordaining Priests.</Q>—But here I inquire; <HI>How</HI> is it agreable? Do <HI>Presbyters</HI> of the Church of <HI>England</HI> joyn in laying on of Hands in the Consecrating of a <HI>Bishop,</HI> such as <HI>Timothy</HI> is suppos'd by Epis∣copalians to be? No, I trow not. 'Tis only the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> and <HI>Bishops present,</HI> that joyn in this Act; as may be seen in the Rubrick of the Of∣fice for the Consecration of Bishops. Either then it must be confessed, <HI>Timothy</HI> was not a <HI>Bishop;</HI> and so one of the great Arguments for <HI>Prelacy</HI> will be drop't. Or at least it must be suppos'd <HI>Timothy</HI> was not ordain'd Bishop <HI>at that time,</HI> when <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; the <HI>Presbytery</HI> joyn'd together in imposing hands on him: however he might be afterwards, by <HI>Paul</HI> alone; which I think will supersede the common Pretences for <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Episcopacy, from the <HI>first</HI> Epistle to Him. Or else the Church of <HI>England</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="002531_0012_0FDB5BDF1DA704C8"/>
must confess, She <HI>Deviates</HI> from the primitive <HI>Pattern,</HI> in excluding <HI>Presbyters</HI> from joyning in the Ordination of her Bishops: and so far She must appear not Primitive and Apostolical; and her <HI>Prelates</HI> must be own'd not <HI>regularly</HI> conse∣crated; because their Ordinations are without the Concurrence of the <HI>Presbytery.</HI> — One of these three, I think, must necessarily be granted: and let the Gentleman chuse which he likes best.</P>
<P>BUT now, supposing there were no such Diffi∣culties arising on the Head of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Character, and allowing that <HI>Paul</HI>'s associating with him the Presbytery in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination, was but like the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s taking the Hands of some <HI>Presbyters</HI> with his, (as is the practice of the Church of <HI>England</HI>) in the ordination of a <HI>Presbyter;</HI> what Advantage will our Opponents be able to make of such a Concession? I think, none at all. For it seems to me, nothing more can be hence collected, but that as the <HI>Apostles</HI> did not appropriate to themselves the Power of Ordination, so neither doth the Church of <HI>England</HI> allow her <HI>Bishops</HI> to arrogate to themselves the sole Power in this matter. The Practice of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as well as of the Apostles, seems to argue for an inherent Power of ordination in <HI>Presbyters;</HI> which is all we at present plead for. Imposition of Hands is what our Opponents account a very es∣sential Rite in Ordination. That they judge is put for the whole Ministerial Work of Ordina∣tion, in 1 Tim. 5.22. <HI>Lay Hands suddenly on no man:</HI> and hence they urge this place, in favour of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s ordaining Power. Now if Impositi∣on of Hands, when perform'd by <HI>Timothy,</HI> was an ordaining Act, and imported an ordaining Power inherent in him; why might it not have the
<PB N="12" REF="002531_0013_0FDB5BE36FEA53B0"/>
same Signification, when perform'd by the <HI>Pres∣bytery?</HI> And if Ordination was the End and Im∣port of <HI>Paul</HI>'s laying on of Hands; why not also of the laying on of the Hands of the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> that joyn'd with him? To say, That the Pres∣byters laid on hands only as <HI>Witnesses,</HI> and to ex∣press their <HI>Consent,</HI> &amp; <HI>Approbation</HI> of the Apostle's Act, (as some pretend) is but a filly Evasion. When was the Ceremony ever used for such an End? And might not the <HI>Presbyters</HI> as well have express'd their Concurrence, by saying AMEN to the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s Prayer over <HI>Timothy,</HI> or in some other way; without joyning with the Apostle in <HI>Imposition of Hands,</HI> which wou'd seem to bespeak an ordaining Power in them, as well as in him, and so be likely to prove an Occasion of Error <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sin in future Times, by leading Presbyters to claim to themselves the power of Ordination; their right whereunto they might with good Colour argue from this primitive Example! It can't be reasonably suppos'd, that the Apostle (who was such a <HI>wise Master-Builder,</HI> and was so sollicitous that Ministers <HI>might know how to behave themselves in the House of God</HI>) shou'd be so over∣seen in the management of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination, as to lay a foundation for Mistakes in a matter of such Importance, as this of Ordination. We may well think the Apostle wou'd not have admitted the <HI>Presbytery</HI> to lay on hands with him, if they had not been vested with a Right to ordain, see∣ing it was like to prove such a <HI>Snare</HI> to After-ages; as it manifestly has been, if <HI>Presbyterians</HI> are in the Wrong.</P>
<P>WELL but for once we will suppose, that the <HI>Presbytery</HI> did not lay on hands <HI>as Ordainers,</HI> but the whole Efficacy of the Ordination was from
<PB N="13" REF="002531_0014_0FDB5BE5F678DEB8"/>
the Imposition of <HI>Paul</HI>s Hands; yet how will this tend to serve our Author's Cause? Will this infer, that <HI>Bishops</HI> may assume to themselves the whole Power, exclusively of the Presbyters joyn∣ing with them? No, not at all. I will make it out thus. <HI>Paul</HI> laid on hands, either in his ordi∣nary, or extraordinary Capacity. Now if the whole Efficacy of the Ordination was from HIS Imposing of Hands, It cou'd not be in his <HI>ordinary</HI> Capacity, that he ordain'd; because an Apostle in his ordinary Character was but a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> (as I think is fully prov'd in the <HI>Sober Remarks,</HI> to which I must refer the Reader for satisfaction) and upon this view of them, there can be no solid Reasons assign'd for so essential a <HI>Difference</HI> (in the Virtue and Meaning) between the Act of <HI>Paul,</HI> and the Act of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination. Hence therefore it must be in his <HI>extraordinary</HI> Capacity, that <HI>Paul</HI> ordain'd; and if so, then I ask, what Warrant <HI>Paul</HI>'s having the sole ordaining Power, exclusively of the Presby∣tery, will be to <HI>Bishops,</HI> for confining the Power of Ordination wholly to themselves? Are they Suc∣cessors to the Apostles, in the <HI>extraordinary</HI> parts of their Character? Have our Bishops the Gift of <HI>Infallibility?</HI> Have they the Power of <HI>dis∣cerning Spirits?</HI> Or can they confer the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> by the laying on of their Hands? Verily, show us Bishops so qualify'd, and we shall be tempted to leave the work of Ordination <HI>wholly</HI> to Them, wherever they come! But till we can see such Bishops (at least till then) we must be allow'd to assert the <HI>Presbyters</HI> Claim to the Power of Ordination. <Q>And indeed the moderate As∣sertors of Episcopacy (as one observes) do ac∣knowlege that the Presbyters lay on hands
<PB N="14" REF="002531_0015_0FDB5BE7622D5808"/>
with the Bishop) <HI>as Ordainers.</HI> So Dr. <HI>F<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lk,</HI> Dr. <HI>Forbes,</HI> the Arch-bishop of <HI>Spalato,</HI> and others. Even Dr. <HI>Cave</HI> (whose Authority, with the true Sons of the Church, is become al∣most indisputable) says, That Imposition of Hands was constantly us'd as the Rite of con∣ferring Ordination upon the Ministers of CHRIST.</Q></P>
<P>NOW therefore, if Presbyters lay on hands with the Bishop, as <HI>Ordainers,</HI> either They have an equal Power, or not. If they have an <HI>equal</HI> Power, then in the Ordination of a Minister, there is as much to be attributed to the Presbyters lay∣ing on of Hands, as to the Bishops: and hence it will follow, that Ordinations perform'd by Pres∣byters, without a Diocesan Bishop, are no more null and void, than ordinations perform'd by such a Bishop, without the concurrence of the Presbytery.— But if any shall say, <HI>Presbyters</HI> have <HI>not</HI> an equal ordaining Power, with the Bishop; I then ask, How this appears? If their Power be unequal, it must arise, either from unequal <HI>Commissions,</HI> or from unequal <HI>Qualifications.</HI> It cannot be owing to any difference of intrinsick <HI>Qualifications</HI> and Gifts. For if we consider the <HI>Nature</HI> of Ordination, we shall find that the ordi∣nary Gifts of <HI>Presbyters</HI> are proportionable to all the outward Acts of it. What is Ordination, but a solemn <HI>Dedication</HI> or <HI>Separation</HI> of a sutable Per∣son to God for the Ministry, by Fasting &amp; Prayer, with laying on of Hands? Now what is there in all this, above the Capacity of a <HI>mere</HI> Presbyter? What does the Bishop do more in his <HI>conferring the Ministry?</HI> Is it in any Moral Act, or in the Physical Contact only, that the Bishop exerts more of an ordaining Power! Is there any secret Vir∣tue
<PB N="15" REF="002531_0016_0FDB5BEB5A98D298"/>
in the Touch of a <HI>Prelate</HI>'s Hand! If so, from whence shou'd it spring? From his Superior Gifts, or from his exce<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ing Sanctity? Which of 'em, I pray!—But I believe our Opponents will not so much ground the Distinction here. If then there be an Inequality of ordaining Power, in Bishops and in Presbyters, it must arise from the Difference of their <HI>Commissions.</HI> But this cannot be; because the Commission for ordination is one, and no more. An ordaining Power is included in the Apostles Commission, Mat. 28.19. <HI>Go teach all Nations, baptising them,</HI> &amp;c. Or, (if it will please our Author better in his own Text) Joh. 20.21. <HI>As my Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</HI> And they that pretend to the power of or∣dination, must claim it by this Commission, as Successors to the Apostles in the standing parts of the Gospel-Ministry. Hence then, if Presbyters have any degree of ordaining Power, it is equal &amp; the same with the Bishops, without any the least Disparity or Distinction. I think there cannot be a clearer Consequence. If therefore my Lords the Bishops will claim a superior Power to Pres∣byters; They must either produce some <HI>new</HI> Commission for it: or prove that Presbyters do not derive what ordaining Power they have, from the Commission <HI>above-mentioned:</HI> or else that the ministerial Powers given the Apostles in this Commission, might be transmitted to their Suc∣cessors in <HI>unequal</HI> Degrees. One of these things they must do before we can become their Profe∣lytes, and let them undertake which they please, I'm afraid they'll fail in the Attempt and Confusion will cover 'em,— Thus I have ful∣ly consider'd the Gentleman's <HI>first</HI> Answer to
<PB N="16" REF="002531_0017_0FDB5BED618F9D20"/>
our Plea for Ordination by <HI>Presbyters,</HI> from 1 Tim 4.14.</P>
<P>HE adds another Evasion. page 81. saying, <Q>But indeed many eminent Divines are of opini∣on, that the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, which is render'd <HI>Presbytery,</HI> signifies the <HI>Office,</HI> to which <HI>Timothy</HI> was ordain'd; not the <HI>Persons</HI> who laid hands on him.</Q> And because he supposes <HI>that</HI> would be of greatest weight with as, he produces the Testimony of <HI>Calvin,</HI> in favour of this Opinion.—Now I freely confess, I honour <HI>Calvin</HI> highly: His Testimony has no little weight with me: I think it is as good an Authority as any. But I never set up <HI>Calvin</HI> for an <HI>Oracle,</HI> nor counted him <HI>Infallible.</HI> That He was not so, appears, in that he saw fit afterwards to alter his Mind in the very Point we are upon. It is out of <HI>Calvin</HI>'s <HI>Institutions,</HI> (which He wrote when he was a <HI>young Man</HI>) that our Author has taken his Tes∣timony: but if he intended to deal ingenuously, he shou'd have consulted <HI>Calvin's Commentaries</HI> on the first Epistle to <HI>Timothy</HI> (which He wrote twenty Years afterwards, when he was more ca∣pable of judging, and had consider'd the matter more maturely) and there He wou'd have found this great Man expressing a different Apprehensi∣on, and giving it as <HI>his Judgment,</HI> <Q>That they who understand the word <HI>Presbytery</HI> in a <HI>col∣lective</HI> sense, as meaning the <HI>College of Presby∣ters,</HI> are in the <HI>Right</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Presbyterium:</HI> Qui hic collectivum nomen esse putant, pro collegio Presbyterorum positum, RECTE. SEN. TIUNT MEO JUDICIO.</NOTE>.</Q> And truly I wonder how <HI>Calvin,</HI> or any Body else cou'd ever come into the other Construction; it seems so harsh,
<PB N="17" REF="002531_0018_0FDB5BEEEB3FF9C8"/>
so forced, and scarce reconcilable with common sense. What, the <HI>laying on of the HANDS of the Office of Presbyters!</HI> Very uncouth and bar∣barous Language methinks! I always imagin'd that <HI>Hands</HI> were the Property of Persons; and <HI>laying on of Hands,</HI> an action not applicable to Offices.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, because I'm willing as much as possible to take our Author in his own way, (a way the least liable to Cavils) I will for once suppose, it is only the <HI>Office</HI> of <HI>Presbyterate,</HI> that's here spoken of: Yet I doubt not, this Sense will make the Text as little improvable to his purpose, &amp; as much serviceable to the Presbyterian Cause, as the other, altho' he cou'd not, or wou'd not see it. For from hence it will follow, that <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> are the same, and not two Orders. Here consider, It wou'd be absurd to suppose, when the Apostle was exhorting <HI>Timothy</HI> to a faith∣ful and diligent Discharge of his Office and Work at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> that He shou'd put him in mind <HI>only</HI> of his Ordination to the Office of a <HI>Presbyters;</HI> if he had been by any second and superior ordina∣tion advanced to the Office of a Diocesan <HI>Bishop.</HI> Hence then we must in Reason conclude, that at the writing of this <HI>first</HI> Epistle, <HI>Timothy</HI> was not a Diocesan, but a <HI>Presbyter.</HI> And yet in this very Epistle (as our Author observes to us, pag. 83.) St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells <HI>Timothy,</HI> That his design in leaving him at <HI>Ephesus</HI> was, <HI>That he might charge some that they preach no other Doctrine.</HI> And he gives Di∣rections for his exercising spiritual <HI>Censures,</HI> and managing the business of <HI>Ordination.</HI> Now if <HI>Timothy,</HI> while yet a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> was impower'd to do these things, the Consequence is unavoida∣ble, That the powers of <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>Ordina∣tion</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="002531_0019_0FDB5BF06E733C40"/>
do belong to Presbyters: and so Bishops and Presbyters must necessary be of the same Order.</P>
<P>THUS it appears, The Gentleman is under a great mistake, and triumphs too soon, when he draws up that boasting Conclusion; <Q>So that the word <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, in what sense you will, will be of no service to the Presbyterian Cause.</Q> I leave it to the Reader's Judgment.</P>
<P>AND now it were as easy to show the Vanity and Weakness of another Motion, which he hints at as <Q>the Opinion of Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> and other great Divines, <HI>viz.</HI> That bay the <HI>Presbytery</HI> here is understood the <HI>Apostles:</HI> for both St. <HI>Peter</HI> &amp; St. <HI>John</HI> call themselves <HI>Presbyters.</HI></Q></P>
<P>TO this I reply, first, They could not be a College of <HI>Apostles,</HI> that ordain'd <HI>Timothy;</HI> be∣cause (if I may bring an Argument <HI>ad <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) Paul</HI> seems to speak of the Ordination of <HI>Timothy,</HI> as if the whole Virtue and Efficacy of it lay in the Imposition of <HI>his</HI> Hands. Our Author ob∣served to us just now, <Q>That St. <HI>Paul</HI> says expresly, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6. that <HI>Timothy</HI> was or∣dain'd <HI>by the laying on of HIS Hands.</HI></Q> Now then either the Gentleman has put a wrong sense on this (last) Text, and so it can be of no force against the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he apply'd it before. Or else it must be of force against Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI>'s Notion, which be here mentions, That the <HI>Pres∣bytery</HI> in the former Text meant a number of <HI>Apostles;</HI> for it do's not seem consistent with the Modesty and Humility of <HI>Paul,</HI> so to express him∣self as if He was the SOLE ordainer of <HI>Timothy,</HI> when the other <HI>Apostles</HI> joyning with him, had <HI>equally</HI> the Power of ordination.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="002531_0020_0FDB5BF57437B8B8"/>BUT now shou'd we for once grant, that they were <HI>Apostles</HI> only, that laid on hands in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s ordination, I cannot see how our Author will be able to serve his Cause by it. For nothing can be more evident than that, whoever ordain'd <HI>Timothy,</HI> they did it as a <HI>Presbytery:</HI> They acted in the Quality of <HI>Presbyters.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Apostle's giving the ordainers a <HI>common <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> only, it seems they acted only in their <HI>ordinary Capacity.</HI> And here the Dispute returns, whether or no <HI>Presbyters</HI> do succeed the Apostles in their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ordinary Capacity. And I think this very Text we are upon, may serve to decide it in the <HI>Affirmative.</HI> For, 'tis granted by our Adversarys, That they are true &amp; complete Successors of the Apostles, who succeed them in the Power of <HI>Ordination:</HI> and now that <HI>Presbyters</HI> do succeed them in this Power, seems a plain Consequence from the Apostles assuming no other than the Character of a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> in the ordain∣ing of <HI>Timothy:</HI> [supposing the ordainers were Apostles.] At least there is so much Colour for this Conclusion, that if it had been said, <HI>By the laying on of the Hands of the</HI> Episcopacy, <HI>or Consisto∣ry of Bishops,</HI> I doubt not our <HI>Opponents</HI> wou'd have presently boasted the Text was <HI>decisive,</HI> and have made very harsh Reflections upon us, if we had presum'd to question it.—But I shall say no more here, seeing our Author seems not ford of Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI>'s Notion, <Q>because he do's not take it to be very <HI>plain</HI> and <HI>obvious:</HI> and he do'sn't insist upon it (he says) because he has neither Leisure nor Inclination for Dispute.</Q> A very fine excuse truly, when he finds in the Dispute he is like to be press'd with insuperable Difficulties! And I shou'd have charitably thought
<PB N="20" REF="002531_0021_0FDB5BF658D88110"/>
the Man had been sincere, if he had not fill'd his Pages with so many <HI>Cavils</HI> already.</P>
<P>WELL but however <HI>that</HI> Notion be, plain or not; one thing he thinks is very plain, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That there is neither <HI>Precept</HI> nor <HI>Example</HI> in holy Scripture for <HI>Presbyters, <HI>without a Superior,</HI></HI> to ordain a Presbyter. <HI>Pag.</HI> 82.</Q></P>
<P>HERE, in answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. I deny this to be very plain and obvious: and rather think the contrary is so. To clear this we must note, that our Author confines the Power of Ordination to the <HI>Apostles</HI> only, and their Suc∣cessors, which he supposes Diocesan <HI>Bishops</HI> to be. He told us, pag. 80, <Q>We find it always per∣form'd by the <HI>Apostles:</HI> And then, pag. 90. He tells us, the Power which our Bishops of Right exercise, is the same with which our Blessed Saviour vested the Eleven Apostles.</Q> Hence by the <HI>Superior,</HI> which our Author here talks of, as presiding in all the ordinations men∣tion'd in Scripture, must be understood an <HI>Apostle,</HI> or a Diocesan <HI>Bishop.</HI> Now then if there can be found an Instance of <HI>Presbyters</HI> ordaining, without the Presidency, either of an <HI>Apostle,</HI> or such a <HI>Bishop,</HI> I hope the Gentleman will see his mistake. And for such an one, I refer him to <HI>Acts</HI> 13.— where he will find <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> separated to their special Ministry among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> by the Hand of certain <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> at <HI>Antioch,</HI> who were neither Apostles nor Diocesans.—Upon which one thus argues; <Q>Either this Ordination is a Precedent to us, or not. If not, how can we be sure that those of <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> or any other be so? If it be a Precedent, then
<PB N="21" REF="002531_0022_0FDB5BF899797C00"/>
<HI>Presbyters</HI> have power to ordain; and that <HI>without</HI> Superior Bishops, or Apostles, to preside.</Q>— But it may be, our Author will demand a <HI>Pre∣cept</HI> as well as Example, for Presbyterian ordina∣tion. Now for this let him consult the same Place, and he will find, That the HOLY GHOST <HI>said</HI> unto those Presbyters, <HI>Separate me</HI> Barnabas <HI>and</HI> Saul, <HI>for the work whereunto I have called them.</HI> Here is an express <HI>Commission</HI> to those Presbyters to ordain, and this is Warrant enough for others to do it. Here is an Example of Presbyters or∣daining, by the Authority of the <HI>Holy Ghost:</HI> and such an Example must have the Force of a Pre∣cept. If any now object, That that Commission to the Presbyters, was a special and extraordina∣ry one, (being receiv'd by immediate Inspiration) and therefore not to be argu'd from: I answer, By the same Rule, we may say that (Bishop) <HI>Timothy</HI>'s ordaining Power was extraordinary. For as this Gift was given him by <HI>Prophesie,</HI> at his ordination; So it was by the Inspiration of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> that <HI>Paul</HI> gave him that Direction, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.22. by which our Author says, He <HI>im∣powered</HI> Him to <HI>ordain others.</HI> (<HI>Pag.</HI> 83.) Either then our Opponents must give up their Argument for Episcopal Ordination, from the inspired Instructi∣ons given to (Bishop) <HI>Timothy</HI> about the Exer∣cise of his ordaining Power. Or else they must allow our Plea for Presbyterian ordination, from the inspired Commission, or rather Direction, given to the <HI>Presbyters</HI> at <HI>Antioch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I HAVE not so much as mention'd</HI> the Instances of <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> who I think were neither Apostles, nor Diocesan Bishops; and yet ordained Presbyters without a <HI>Superiour:</HI> because their
<PB N="22" REF="002531_0023_0FDB5BFC8DB6F898"/>
Character is controverted, and <Q>I wou'd urge nothing but what I take to be very plain and obvious.</Q></P>
<P>BUT now, —</P>
<P N="2">2. SUPPOSING this Answer were not absolute∣ly conclusive, and granting for once, That there is <HI>no Example,</HI> in <HI>Scripture</HI> times, of the ordina∣tion of a Presbyter, by Presbyters, <HI>without a Su∣perior:</HI> yet this will be no valid Objection against the practice of Presbyterian ordination now. We will for once suppose, That <HI>Presbyters</HI> in the Apostles time, never ordain'd but under the Pre∣sidency of some <HI>Apostle:</HI> yet this will not infer any necessity of a Superior Officer to preside in <HI>future</HI> ordinations. 'Twas but sitting that the Apostles shou'd have the Direction of such Af∣fairs, wherever they came; and that ordinary Ministers shou'd pay a mighty Deference to such extraordinary Men as they. The ordinary Pres∣byters did in a manner continually need the Con∣duct of some such inspired Men, till the <HI>Canon</HI> of the <HI>New Testament</HI> was completed; which be∣ing done, the use of those extraordinary Directors was superseded, by the standing Guide or Rule; a Rule <HI>given by Inspiration of God, and profitable for Doctrine,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>that the Man of God may be per∣fect, thorou<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly farnished were all good works,</HI> (2 Tim. 3.16, 17.) The Reason of Things is altered, There are now no such inspired Men is the Apos∣tles; not is there any such need of them now, as there was at first.</P>
<P>IN fine, The supposed Presidency of the Apostles in the Ordinations in their time, can be no more an Objection against Ordination by <HI>Presbyters</HI> alone, than by <HI>Bishops</HI> alone. For either there were no such Men as Diocesan Bishops then;
<PB N="23" REF="002531_0024_0FDB5BFDE02D4630"/>
or admitting there were, the Apostles had a Su∣periority over them, and Bishops cou'd no more ordain without an Apostle, than Presbyters cou'd. Let our Adversaries produce either Scripture Pre∣cept, or Scripture Precedent, for Diocesan <HI>Bishops</HI> ordaining <HI>without a Superior:</HI> or tell us how the Presidency of the <HI>Apostles</HI> can make for the Pre∣sidency of <HI>Bishops,</HI> in the ordinations of Ministers: or show us any Divine <HI>Prohibition</HI> of <HI>Presbyters</HI> ordaining <HI>without</HI> a Superior. Let 'em do any one of these three things, and we shall take it very kindly at their hands. But till then, they must allow us to insist upon it, That ordination by Presbyters, without a Bishop, is valid and regu∣lar. — And thus I have done with our Author's <HI>second</HI> Instance of the Apostles Power over the Rest of the Ministers in their Time.</P>
<P>I shall but touch upon the Hint be gives next, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>As to the Power of <HI>censuring Offenders</HI> exercised by the <HI>Apostles,</HI> it is plain from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.21. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.3. 1 <HI>Tim</HI> 1.20.</Q>—In answer to this, it may be observed, That as to the Power of censuring Offenders exercised by <HI>Presbyters</HI> too, it is equally plain from 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5. 5, 7, 12, 13. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.6. 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.12. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.4, 5. <HI>Heb.</HI> 13.17.— And it is but a just Con∣sequence from their having the Power of <HI>Absolu∣tion.</HI> For the Power of <HI>Binding,</HI> and the Power of <HI>Loosing,</HI> are connected, and given in the same Commission, <HI>Joh.</HI> 20.23. So that they who are vested with one of those Powers, have an equal Claim to the other. Now our <HI>Author</HI> himself (in his 93d page) expresly ascribes to <HI>Presbyters</HI> <Q>the Power of <HI>absolving Offenders</HI> upon their Repentance; which Power (he tells us) is no
<PB N="24" REF="002531_0025_0FDB5BFF59705FF8"/>
other than what they have exercised for these 1700 years.</Q>— And I find in the <HI>Church of England</HI> Form of ordaining <HI>Priests,</HI> the Bishop first takes a Promise of the Presbyter, to be or∣dain'd, <Q>That He will give his faithful Diligence always so to minister the DISCIPLINE of CHRIST, <HI>as the Lord hath commanded:</HI></Q> And afterward at the Imposition of Hands, the Bishop says to him, <Q>Whose Sins <HI>Thou</HI> dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose Sins <HI>Thou</HI> dost retain, they are retained.</Q> Which are the very words of the <HI>Apostolical</HI> Commission, <HI>Joh.</HI> 20.— And the same is repeated at the Consecration of <HI>Bishops.</HI> So that it shou'd seem, the <HI>Church of England</HI> supposes her <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> to be equally vested with the Power of <HI>Discipline,</HI> according to the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD; and what <HI>dif∣ference</HI> there is in the Exercise of it, must be grounded on <HI>Civil</HI> Constitutions: as indeed seems to be hinted to us when the <HI>Bishop</HI> at his Conse∣cration, promises, <Q>to correct and punish the Criminous within his Diocess, according to such Authority as he <HI>hath <HI>by GOD's Word,</HI></HI> and as to him <HI>shall</HI> be committed by the ordi∣nance of <HI>this Realm.</HI></Q></P>
<P>BUT to proceed with our Author; — He concludes his first Head, with <HI>replying</HI> to an <HI>Objection.</HI> <Q>The only Answer (says he) that I know to this Argument, taken from the Apostles using these Powers of Ordination &amp; Jurisdicti∣on, is▪ — That the Apostles were <HI>extraordi∣nary <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> and therefore tho' they exercis'd those Superior Powers, it is no Argument for the continuance of them in some above others.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="002531_0026_0FDB5C00DC9B7C80"/>THIS he is pleas'd to call <HI>a begging of the Question:</HI> and demands of us, <Q>Wherein the extraordinariness of the Apostolick <HI>Office</HI> did consist!</Q> Among other Particulars mention'd by him, he queries whether it consisted <HI>in their being sent by</HI> CHRIST: and says upon it, <Q>So were the <HI>Seventy.</HI></Q>— Grant it: but then their Mission was but <HI>occasional</HI> &amp; <HI>temporary,</HI> as I think is fully prov'd in the <HI>Sober Remarks.</HI> So that for him to argue from the <HI>Seventy</HI> here, I'm sure is so far a begging of the Question. However, it is not their immediate Mission alone, nor yet their itinerant State, &amp; Power of working Miracles only (which is all our Author mention's) where∣in we place the extraordinariness of the Apostles: but in the power of <HI>discerning Spirits,</HI> the power of <HI>conferring the Holy Gho<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> the Gift of <HI>Infalli∣bility,</HI> and the peculiar <HI>Conduct</HI> of the <HI>Divine Spirit</HI> they were under, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Things which our Author very <HI>prudently</HI> omits; for he must needs know that these were the more eminent <HI>Signs of an Apostle;</HI> Things by which the Apostles were especially distinguish'd, &amp; on the account where∣of they were <Q><HI>extraordinary</HI> Men, not only with respect to <HI>us,</HI> but also with respect to the others who liv'd in <HI>their own Time.</HI></Q> (Which I hope will satisfy our Author.) —So that if the <HI>Extraor∣dinariness</HI> of the Apostles (<HI>suppose</HI> it <HI>real</HI>) cou'd be any valid Objection against the <HI>Continuance</HI> of Apostolical Superiority in some over others, the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> must needs gain their Point, since it appears so plainly that the Apostles were indeed extraordinary Men. And now, that it wou'd be a <HI>valid</HI> Objection, is evident, in that the Apostles Superiority took its <HI>Rise</HI> from those Things, for which they were extraordinary. Thus in reveal∣ing
<PB N="26" REF="002531_0027_0FDB5C05EACC4C80"/>
the Will of GOD in certain Laws &amp; Canons, to bind the Church, and in determining matters of Faith, and the like, They did not act in the Quality of <HI>Church-Governors,</HI> so much as of Men <HI>extraordinarily</HI> illuminated, and inspir'd, <HI>infalli∣bly</HI> to deliver the whole Counsel of GOD to the World. As to any Supremacy of <HI>Office,</HI> this must be derived from some Commission: which Com∣mission must be either ordinary or extraordinary, If it was extraordinary, then it is ceased; and so there can be no Argument form'd for Prelacy, from the Apostolical Superiority. And extraor∣dinary it must be, if the Apostolical Superiority was properly <HI>ex officio,</HI> strictly <HI>Authoritative.</HI> For I know of no <HI>ordinary</HI> Commission they re∣ceiv'd, which contain'd any thing more than the ordinary Ministerial Powers, common to others with them. And I know of nothing the Apostles did or acted, but what <HI>Presbyters</HI> might do as well as they; suppose 'em in the same extraordina∣ry Circumstances, indu'd with the same extraor∣dinary Qualifications, and under the same extra∣ordinary Conduct of GOD's Spirit. And indeed, I know of no Authority <HI>Paul</HI> exercised over <HI>Pres∣byters,</HI> more than what he exercised over <HI>Timothy,</HI> the supposed Bishop of <HI>Ephesus!</HI> Nay, perhaps no more than what He exercised towards <HI>Peter,</HI> (tho' an Apostle, equal to himself,) when he <HI>withstood him to the face, because he was to be blamed</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gal.</HI> 2.11.</NOTE>; or than what other Apostles at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> exercised, when they <HI>sent <HI>Peter</HI></HI> &amp; <HI>John</HI> (two of their own number) down to <HI>Samaria,</HI> upon news of the Gospel's being receiv'd there <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Act.</HI> 8.14.</NOTE>. In a word, what∣ever Superiority the Apostles had over Presby∣ters,
<PB N="27" REF="002531_0028_0FDB5C06E1CA8340"/>
I cannot at present but be of Opinion, that it was a Superiority of <HI>Dignity,</HI> in respect of pe∣culiar Abilities &amp; Privileges, (which gave them a peculiar Influence, &amp; a kind of Authority over Men's Consciences,) rather than a Superiority of <HI>ruling Power,</HI> in respect of any peculiar Office they sustain'd. And of this Opinion I must re∣main, until our Opponents can prove that the <HI>Apostles</HI> receiv'd some <HI>other</HI> Commission from their risen Lord, besides that in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. &amp; <HI>Joh.</HI> 20.—or prove that the Commission for the Gospel-Ministry is <HI>more than one;</HI> either by demonstrating that the Commission of the <HI>Seventy</HI> is of force still, and that with respect to the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> or by pro∣ducing some <HI>new</HI> Commission for Presbyters (<HI>sub∣ject</HI>-Presbyters.) given by CHRIST, or his Apos∣tles. All which I despair of their being ever able to do.</P>
<P>IT is then a very bold &amp; ignorant Consequence, which our Author draws from his preceding Discourse, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That whosoever asserts the Apostolical <HI>Superiority</HI> was only temporary, may as well say, that the <HI>Sacraments</HI> were con∣fin'd to the Times of the Apostles: and indeed the <HI>Quakers</HI> (who say so) have as conclud∣ing Reasons for their Assertion, as the Presby∣terians have for the other.</Q> I shall make no particular Remarks on this wild Passage; because I believe <HI>the Folly of it will be manifest to all Men,</HI> that impartially weigh the Reasons that have been given to support the Presbyterian As∣sertion. But if any desire a more direct Reply, they may find one in the <HI>Sober Remarks,</HI> toward the End.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="002531_0029_0FDB5C085ECD1220"/>OUR Author comes now to his <HI>second</HI> Argu∣ment for Prelacy, <Q>from the Apostles <HI>deriving</HI> the Apostolical <HI>Power</HI> over Clergy and Laiety, to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in the several Churches which they planted. — That the Apostles did <HI>de facts</HI> delegate <HI>their</HI> Power to others, is want be af∣firms. And of this, says he, I shall name only two Instances, <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> who were ordain'd or consecrated <HI>Bishops</HI> of <HI>Ephesus</HI> &amp; <HI>Crete</HI> by St. <HI>Paul.</HI> (Pag. 83.)</Q></P>
<P>TO this, much might be said in Reply, but I shall wave it all, &amp; refer you to the <HI>Sober Remarks;</HI> where, that the Apostles did not desire the A∣postolical Power and Superiority unto others, &amp; that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were not Diocesan Bishops, are both made evident, <HI>I wou'd say, beyond contra∣diction</HI> (to borrow some of our Author's Phrases) <HI>but that Demonstration may be oppos'd when People <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mind to wrangle.</HI> Enough &amp; enough I think, is there said <HI>to convince any <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but him that is resolv'd not to be convinc'd,</HI> that the <HI>Bishops do take were Power to themselves, under <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of a Succession from the Apostles, than St.</HI> Paul <HI>gave to</HI> Timothy <HI>and</HI> Titus: So that <HI>if they are try'd by St.</HI> Paul's <HI>Epistles, I'm very well satisfy'd</HI> They must be condemn'd and as to what Power they take to themselves, not under such a Colour, but as the <HI>King</HI>'s Ministers, I must leave them to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Author's Vindication.</P>
<P>I might say something here upon the Argu∣ment from the <HI>Angels</HI> of the seven Churches, mention'd in the next place; but that I am in some measure prevented by the <HI>Sober Remarks,</HI> and am willing (with our Author) to <HI>avoid as much as possible being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="002531_0030_0FDB5C09D61F1DD0"/>I might also here consider our Author's <HI>Quota∣tions</HI> from the <HI>Fathers,</HI> which follow next: and I think it might easily be made appear, that none of them do establish the <HI>Diocesan Bishop;</HI> but on the contrary, some of them do very plainly make against Him. However, it being my Design (for Reasons already mention'd) to confine my self at present to <HI>Scripture</HI>-Evidence, I shall not enter in∣to that Argument.</P>
<P>BUT I will now proceed to the Author's <HI>last</HI> general Head, <HI>Pag.</HI> 90. Where he proposes to consider <Q>the <HI>Names</HI> given to the several <HI>Gospel-Ministers,</HI> by the Church of <HI>England</HI> in her Li∣tany, <HI>viz. bishops, Priests,</HI> &amp; <HI>Deacons.</HI></Q></P>
<P>UNDER this Head He first speaks of the <HI>pro∣miscuous</HI> use of the Names, <HI>Bishop</HI> &amp; <HI>Presbyter,</HI> in the holy Scriptures, and says he thinks <HI>that</HI> will be no Argument for the <HI>Identity</HI> of the <HI>Office.</HI>—To which I shall say nothing, since this Ar∣gument is so copiously vindicated in the <HI>Sober Remarks.</HI> Only one word, as to our Author's Exception against it, from the <HI>Apostles Superiority to the rest of the Clergy.</HI> In which I think there's nothing of weight. For, do's not this Gentleman pretend there were Diocesan <HI>Bishops</HI> in the Apostles time? And will he not own his supposed <HI>Bishops</HI> were <HI>subject</HI> to the Apostles as well as the Pres∣byters? Do's not the style of <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epistles to <HI>Timothy</HI> &amp; <HI>Titus,</HI> carry in it an Air of <HI>Authority,</HI> as much as his Charges to the Elders of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> or any other? And now if the Bishops were subordinate as well as the Presbyters, will not this make all Reasoning from the <HI>Superiority of the Apostles,</HI> of no force? What Argument can be drawn from hence, till it be prov'd that <HI>Bishops</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="002531_0031_0FDB5C100FB73950"/>
do <HI>succeed</HI> the Apostles in this Superiority? And how can it be pretended, that they do suc∣ceed the Apostles in this Superiority, till it be made appear, either that Bishops were original∣ly an Order of Men <HI>distinct</HI> from, and <HI>above</HI> Pres∣byters: or that they are indu'd with Apostolical <HI>Abilities?</HI> Let our Adversaries prove one or t'o∣ther of these Things: or else we cannot believe that Bishops have any rightful Claim to Aposto∣lical Superiority over Presbyters.</P>
<P>OUR Author says nothing here to support the Episcopal Claim, save what may be contain'd in that odd and surprising Passage, <HI>Pag.</HI> 91 <Q>Since they who in the times of the <HI>Apostles</HI> were call'd by the Name of <HI>Apostles,</HI> and immedi∣ately after their Death distinguish'd by the Title of <HI>Bishops;</HI> since they, I say, were the Persons to whom the Apostles <HI>dying</HI> or <HI>depart∣ing,</HI> deriv'd their Commission; then it neces∣sarily follows that they (who in the Apostolic Age were call'd Apostles &amp; soon after Bishops) had by virtue of that Commission the <HI>full Plenitude</HI> of the <HI>Apostolic Power</HI> derived to them from CHRIST: and by the same Autho∣rity they to whom they delegated their Com∣mission, received the same Power, and so down through all the succeeding Ages of the Christian Church to this day.</Q> — As to the <HI>Truth</HI> of this wonderful Passage, I shall not at present make any Inquiries, because it chiefly relates to mat∣ters of Fact, not in Scripture-History: and as to the <HI>Grammar</HI> and <HI>Sense,</HI> I leave those to clear it up, that have <HI>a better Knack at</HI> criticising, and <HI>solving Paradoxes, than I can pretend to.</HI></P>
<P>BUT there is one thing I'd take notice of, that the Gentleman says, which will very much hurt
<PB N="31" REF="002531_0032_0FDB5C1159385C20"/>
and perplex his Cause; <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>If it is not by vertue of this Commission given to the Apostles by our Saviour, that ALL <HI>Gospel Ministers</HI> are <HI>authorized</HI> &amp; <HI>ordain'd,</HI> I desire any one to shew what <HI>Authority</HI> they have, &amp; where it is given. If it is by vertue of this Commission that any Man is an <HI>authoriz'd Minister,</HI> then it can come by no Hands but the Apostles, and them to whom the Apostles gave it.</Q></P>
<P>THESE are notable Lines indeed; but I doubt our Author has very much wounded his own Cause by them, and contradicted himself.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. HE here <HI>relinquishes</HI> the Argument from the <HI>Seventy,</HI> and so runs counter to the Beginning of his Discourse. There he sat up the 70 as Of∣ficers in the <HI>Gospel-Church,</HI> and suppos'd them to subsist upon a <HI>distinct</HI> Commission from that of the <HI>Eleven Apostles.</HI> But now in the End of his Dis∣course, he <HI>gives up</HI> his Plea from the Seventy, &amp; owns but <HI>one</HI> Commission, <HI>viz.</HI> That given to the <HI>Eleven,</HI> by virtue of which any man is an <HI>authoriz'd</HI> Minister: — Unless perhaps he meant that none cou'd be invested in the Com∣mission of the <HI>Seventy,</HI> but by <HI>Apostles</HI> &amp; <HI>Bishops;</HI> and so all wou'd be ordain'd [in a sense] by vir∣tue of the Commission given to the <HI>Eleven.</HI> But that cou'd not be his meaning, because he is here speaking of the Apostles <HI>delegating <HI>their</HI></HI> Com∣mission, &amp; gives it as his Opinion, "That it was "delegated <HI>to some superior to others;</HI> that is, (as we must explain him from what he says, <HI>pag.</HI> 93.) it was derived to their Successors in <HI>unequal Degrees;</HI> to some, <HI>viz. Presbyters,</HI> in <HI>Part;</HI> to others, <HI>viz. Bishops,</HI> in <HI>Whole.</HI> And (says he, in the last mention'd page) <Q>whatever
<PB N="32" REF="002531_0033_0FDB5C12EB035270"/>
part of the Apostolical Authority any Minister of the Christian Church duly or validly exer∣cises, it is by virtue of a regular <HI>Delegation</HI> from the <HI>first Apostles</HI> or their Successors.</Q></P>
<P>Moreover,</P>
<P N="2">2. BY the foremention'd Assertion, our Author has <HI>defeated all his Arguments besides,</HI> &amp; in effect given up his whole Crase. For, if what he af∣firms be true, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That by virtue of this Com∣mission given to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> ALL Gospel-Ministers are <HI>authoris'd;</HI></Q> then he has put it out of his own Power, to prove that there is any such Order of Men as <HI>Bishops,</HI> distinct from &amp; superior to Pastors or Teachers. To set this in a clear Light, I argue thus. Whosoever is authoriz'd by virtue of that Commission, must derive his Au∣thority from it, either <HI>mediately</HI> &amp; by some distant Consequence, or <HI>immediately</HI> and by a direct In∣vestiture. Now, if ordinary Pastors &amp; Presbyters are authoriz'd at all by virtue of that Commission, it must be by <HI>immediate Investiture.</HI> The <HI>Deacons</HI> indeed have a more remove and mediate or con∣sequential Reference to that Commission: because either their Office was originally <HI>imply'd</HI> in it, but the Apostles (by the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI>) instituted a new &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Order of Men</HI> to sustain <HI>that <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of the Commission; or else a <HI>new Office,</HI> distinct from that of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was in∣stituted, by <HI>virtue</HI> of that Commission.—But now as to the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> their Case is vastly different. For the Presbyters Authority is more <HI>immediately</HI> founded in that Commission, &amp; is not a <HI>secondary</HI> Thing. The Ministerial Commission is but one. I know of no Commission to <HI>preach the Word,</HI> and <HI>administer Gospel-Sacraments,</HI> but
<PB N="33" REF="002531_0034_0FDB5C18958BEA38"/>
that which was given to the Apostles, in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. And no man may pretend to do those Things, but by virtue of that Commission, devolv'd upon him. To allude to some of our Author's own Words be∣fore quoted; <Q>If it is not by virtue of [a direct &amp; proper Investiture in] this Commission given to the Apostles by our Saviour, that ALL <HI>Gospel-Ministers</HI> are authoriz'd, I desire any one to shew me <HI>what</HI> Authority they have, and <HI>where</HI> it is given.</Q> In short, let our Opponents pro∣duce any Commission that the <HI>Apostles</HI> have given, by virtue of that Commission granted to them, instituting an Order of <HI>Gospel-Ministers</HI> or Presby∣ters, not having <HI>Episcopal</HI> Powers; and we will yield the Cause. Or let 'em prove that the <HI>Suc∣cessors</HI> of the Apostles had <HI>Authority</HI> to constitute a new order of mere Presbyters or Subject Pas∣tors; and it will do as well. But till they can perform one or other of these Things, they must indulge our Weakness, if we still adhere to the Opinion, That all Gospel-Ministers are in a <HI>di∣rect</HI> and <HI>immediate</HI> Way authoriz'd by the Apos∣tles Commission, or (in other words) actually <HI>invested</HI> with it.</P>
<P>AND now, if it be thus, it must need follow, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> &amp; <HI>Bishops</HI> are of one &amp; the same Order and Degree; inasmuch as their Claim to the Powers contain'd in that Commission, is <HI>equal</HI> &amp; the same. So much Truth is there, in that Ob∣servation of our Author's, [<HI>pag.</HI> 91.] <Q>That whatever Power the <HI>Apostles</HI> had <HI>by virtue of that Commission,</HI> Those to whom they deriv'd that Commission, must necessarily be vested with <HI>the same;</HI>— and had by virtue of that Commis∣sion the <HI>full Plenitude</HI> of the <HI>Apostolic Power,</HI> derived to 'em from CHRIST.</Q> Hence then,
<PB N="34" REF="002531_0035_0FDB5C19A1A4E270"/>
seeing <HI>All Gospel-Ministers</HI> or <HI>Teachers</HI>] are au∣thoriz'd immediately by that Commission, They must be vested with the <HI>whole</HI> ordinary Power therein contain'd: and <HI>Bishops</HI> can pretend to <HI>no more.</HI> Therefore Bishops &amp; Presbyters are the same.</P>
<P>I can see no Foundation in the world, for that <HI>Distinction</HI> our Author makes, in his 93d page, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q>That the Apostles gave to some <HI>All</HI> their Power; but to others they only gave <HI>Part</HI> of their Power.</Q> He makes this Distinction, in Reply to an <HI>Objection.</HI> <Q>If any (says he) ask how Presbyters can exercise those Powers [namely, <HI>of preaching,</HI> and <HI>administring Gospel-Sacraments,</HI> &amp; <HI>of absolving Offenders upon their Repentance</HI>] without being Apostles or Bishops, since our Savior gave that Commission <HI>only</HI> to the Apostles as such: <HI>I answer,</HI> It is true our Savior gave those Powers <HI>only</HI> to the <HI>Apostles;</HI> but he gave them Authority to delegate that Power to whom they thought fit and worthy; and they gave to some <HI>all</HI> their Power (&amp; so they were as much Apostles as the first Eleven were) but to others they only gave <HI>Part</HI> of their Power; <HI>viz.</HI> To preach, and administer the Sacraments.</Q>— This is his Answer: but I think it will no way solve the Difficulty, nor serve his cause.</P>
<P>IN the first place, I <HI>deny</HI> his <HI>Distinction</HI> here, to have any Foundation <HI>in the Word of God.</HI> For the Ministerial Commission is but one; and they that are ordain'd to the Office of the Gospel-Mi∣nistry instituted in that Commission, are invested with all the Powers that belong to that Office by Divine Institution —. Observe, our <HI>Author</HI> him∣self confesses, that these Powers were at frst
<PB N="35" REF="002531_0036_0FDB5C1E76BB5E28"/>
given <HI>only</HI> to the Eleven <HI>Apostles:</HI> and to them, they were given <HI>Equally.</HI> Hence then, such as <HI>succeed</HI> Them, must be likewise <HI>Equal</HI> Sharers in all those Powers, and the Ministerial Commission must belong to them alike, in its full Extent <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Sober Remarks,</HI> (upon <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19, 20.) where <HI>this Point</HI> is more largely debated.</NOTE>▪ unless the Apostles in CHRIST's name have made some Limitations. And the Proof of this is what we demand. This Gentleman peremptorily asserts, that the Apostles gave their Power to some only in <HI>Part,</HI> and with Restrictions. But this is sooner affirm'd than prov'd. I shall only say here; Had the Apostles convey'd their Mi∣nisterial Powers unto others, in various Degrees, (to some <HI>All,</HI> to others only a <HI>Part</HI>) they wou'd necessarily have set up a <HI>new</HI> &amp; <HI>distinct Officer</HI> in Him that had only a <HI>Part:</HI> and if there had been a distinct Officer set up by them, they wou'd doubt∣less have given him some distinguishing <HI>Name</HI> to be known by, and have stated his peculiar <HI>Qua∣lifications</HI> to regulate the Choice of him, and have introduc'd him into his Work by a distinct <HI>Ordi∣nation</HI> or Consecration <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But we find no Foot∣steps of these Things in the sacred Records. The Names of those that the Apostles ordain'd to the Gospel-Ministry in every Church, [such as <HI>Bishops, Presbyters, Pastors, Teachers,</HI> &amp;c.] are promiscuously apply'd: and the same Qualificati∣ons are indifferently requir'd of them all. And their Ordination is universally the same: and their Work the same. Where then is there any Scripture Ground for our Author's Distinction? Surely it can be nothing but a mere Fiction, to help a lame Cause, that needs such Assistences!
<PB N="36" REF="002531_0037_0FDB5C2116CF89E0"/>
And whatever pretended Sanction it may receive from human Authority &amp; Custom, this will never warrant such a Distribution and Separation of the Powers and Parts of a Divine Commission. We may properly enough apply here that saying of our Saviour, <HI>What therefore God hath joyned toge∣ther, let not Man put asunder.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, to take our Author once more in his own way, I will suppose, that the Apostles actually did derive their Power to others with a <HI>Difference,</HI> to some <HI>All,</HI> and to others only a <HI>Part.</HI> I will suppose there are <HI>Elders,</HI> who have no Power of <HI>Rule,</HI> but are emphatically <HI>Teachers,</HI> having only Power to <HI>preach,</HI> and administer the <HI>Sacraments:</HI> Yet I cannot see at present how our Author can improve such a Concession to serve his Cause. For this will not necessarily infer a Subordination among the Ministers of the Gospel. I'll give two Reasons why I think so.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Episcopacy</HI> that belongs to Ecclesiastical Rulers, is over <HI>the People,</HI> &amp; not over the <HI>Teachers</HI> of the People. 'Tis call'd <HI>an Oversight</HI> of the FLOCK, <HI>Act.</HI> 20.28. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.2.—'Tis call'd <HI>A taking Care of the Church of God,</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.5. And, what is more, Ministers are expresly <HI>forbidden</HI> to usurp Authority over their Brethren in the Mi∣nistry, <HI>Mat.</HI> 20.25. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> [See the <HI>Sober Remarks,</HI> on this Text, <HI>pag.</HI> 99. <HI>Edit.</HI> 2.]</P>
<P N="2">2. CONSIDER, <HI>Government</HI> imply's nothing in its <HI>Nature,</HI> that shou'd be a <HI>Ground of Superiority</HI> in the <HI>Rulers</HI> of the Flock, over those (supposed) mere <HI>Teachers.</HI> The Key of Church-Discipline &amp; Government is represented, by some Judicious Divines, as <HI>inferior</HI> in its Nature to the Key of Doctrine. Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> thus expresses himself; <Q>Since I look upon the Sacramental Actions, as
<PB N="37" REF="002531_0038_0FDB5C22A2106DB0"/>
the <HI>Highest</HI> of sacred Performances, I can∣not but acknowlege those who are empower'd for them, must be of the highest Office in the Church <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Confer. pag. 310.</NOTE>.</Q>—That preaching &amp; administring Sacraments, are the <HI>principal</HI> Parts of the Ministe∣rial Office, seems to be intimated, in that these only are recited in the <HI>Commission</HI> given the Apos∣tles, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. — And the inspired Doctor of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> seems, in several places, to intimate the same to us. How highly do's he magnify his Office, as a <HI>Preacher</HI> of the Gospel, a Steward of the <HI>Mysteries</HI> of Religion, an <HI>Embassador</HI> of Christ, and a Worker together with GOD! And what superior Respects doth he require to be paid to <HI>Gospel-Preachers,</HI> as such! 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.13. <HI>Esteem them very highly</HI> [the same word is render'd <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.20. <HI>Exceeding abundantly] in Love for their Work's sake.</HI> Yea and he makes that Distinction, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. <HI>Let the Elders that rule well, he counted worthy of double Honour; <HI>especially</HI> they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> la∣bour in the Word &amp; Doctrine.</HI> Upon which Text, it may be remark'd—.</P>
<P>HERE are Elders that <HI>rule,</HI> &amp; Elders that <HI>labour</HI> in the <HI>Word.</HI> If these Elders are the <HI>same</HI> &amp; one, here's a <HI>Comparison</HI> between the several Parts of their Office, <HI>Ruling</HI> &amp; <HI>Teaching;</HI> and the Preference is given to the Latter.—Or, If here are <HI>two Kinds</HI> of Presbyters, one Ruling, &amp; the other Teaching, the Precedence is given to the Teaching Presby∣ter.—So that, take it in which sense you will, by the Apostle's Rule, the Key of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> and the Subjects of it, cannot be inferior to the Key of Order or Jurisdiction, &amp; its Recipients. Suppose <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and <HI>Bishops,</HI> to be different Orders,
<PB N="38" REF="002531_0039_0FDB5C26F6E97308"/>
yet Bishops are not a <HI>superior</HI> Order. For, <HI>Go∣vernment</HI> &amp; <HI>Ordination</HI> are those things, wherein Bishops are suppos'd to differ from Presbyters: And these things cannot be any Grounds of <HI>Supe∣riority;</HI> because they are inferior [at least not superior] to those Ministerial Powers, which Presbyters themselves are vested with. If they be not superior in <HI>Dignity,</HI> how can they be a just Foundation of <HI>Authority;</HI> of Authority in Bishops, over Presbyters as such?—Besides, it must be remember'd, the Apostle requires that <HI>distinguish∣ing <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> be paid to the Elders that labour in <HI>Doctrine,</HI> above the Elders that labour in Rule: which he wou'd not have done, if the Elders that rule (you, and rule <HI>well</HI>) had been <HI>more ho∣nourable than their Brethren.</HI>—In a word, I com∣mend this Text to the sober Consideration of our Opponents, &amp; desire 'em to shew me how they can reconcile the Apostolical Canon here, with <HI>their</HI> Scheme of Things, particularly as laid down in the <HI>Modest Proof,</HI> and the <HI>Persuasive. If any Man will</HI> do this, &amp; <HI>make sense of</HI> the Text, [to bor∣row again some of our <HI>Author</HI>'s words, <HI>pag.</HI> 90) <HI>He will have a better Knock at solving Paradoxes then I can pretend it.</HI></P>
<P>AND here I finish my Remarks upon what our Author hath advanced in Proof of the Divine Right of <HI>Prelacy.</HI></P>
<P>I might now make some Observations upon what he says under the head of DEACONS. But this Part of the Controversy between us, is so fully consider'd, and to so good purpose, in the <HI>Sober Remarks,</HI> that I shall not trouble you with any long Talk upon it. Whether it is plain <Q>from the Instance of <HI>Philip,</HI> that the Deacons were <HI>Preachers</HI> &amp; <HI>Baptizers,</HI></Q> — I believe every
<PB N="39" REF="002531_0040_0FDB5C27E5C3B598"/>
one will doubt, who impartially weighs what is said on that Case in the <HI>Sober Remarks.</HI> Yea, our Author himself seems to grant that they were not such at their first setting up. For he says; <Q>I don't deny but the first Institution of that Order in the Church, was to take Care of the Poor and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Church,</Q> [as for his Fling here in a Parenthesis <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Parenthesis is,</HI> (and perhaps that, <HI>viz.</HI> taking Care of the Poor, and the Alms of the Church, wou'd be a more considerable part of their Office at this day than it is made, if the unhappy Divisions that are among us wou'd suffer the Discipline of the Church to take place.)</NOTE> if it was level'd at the <HI>Presbyterians,</HI> it's as senseless as 'tis ill-natur'd] <Q><HI>but</HI> (he adds however) <HI>at the same time they are Gospel-Mi∣nisters, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with a Power of doing several pure∣ly ministerial Acts; such as</HI> preaching by the Bishop's Licence, baptizing, <HI>and</HI> administring the Cup to the People <HI>in the Lord's Supper.</HI></Q>—But how do's he prove they are Gospel-Ministers &amp; vested with power to do these Things? Why; <Q>By their Ordination, by the Example of Scrip∣ture-Deacons, &amp; the long Practice of the Church.</Q> As to the <HI>Practice of the Church,</HI> how ancient so∣ever, that can be of no Weight, if it be against a Divine Institution. And as for the <HI>Example of Scripture-Deacons,</HI> it is all but a Pretence. There is no such Example in Scripture. 'Tis not to be found either in <HI>Philip,</HI> or <HI>Stephen. Stephen</HI> did no more than what any private Man might do, in the like Case, being filled with the Holy Ghost. As for <HI>Philip,</HI> tho' he preach'd, he did not do it as a <HI>Deacon,</HI> but as an <HI>Evangelist</HI> (Act. 21.8.) <Q>And (as one observes) if he had done <HI>otherwise,</HI> it is but what was usually done by gifted Men in those extraordinary Times. <HI>Grotius</HI> quotes

<HI>Act.</HI> 11.20. for private Persons preaching in those times of Persecution.</Q> [on <HI>Acts</HI> 8.5.] <HI>Apollos</HI> seems to be a plain Instance of this. Take it in Dr. <HI>Hammond's</HI> words, (on <HI>Act.</HI> 18.25.) <Q>This <HI>Apollos</HI> had been instructed in the Gospel, and though not so perfectly, yet being very zealous in the way wherein he was entred, he began <HI>[publickly]</HI> to <HI>Preach</HI> the Gospel among them out of the Prophets, and this before he was baptized with the Christian Baptism, being only received by <HI>John</HI> to the believing in him that was to come: and by consequence, not then ordain'd by the Apostles.</Q> We have other Instances in the 12 <HI>Ephesian Disciples,</HI> who had not receiv'd the Holy Ghost, nor gone any farther than <HI>John</HI>'s Baptism, at the time of <HI>Paul</HI>'s coming to them. (<HI>Act.</HI> 19. <HI>begin.</HI>) Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> speaks of them as <HI>Chris∣tian Professors publishing the Gospel at Ephesus;</HI> and that without having <HI>given them (of the Holy Ghost) Authority or Gifts for the Work of the Ministery.</HI> And now if private Persons, without having re∣ceiv'd ordination to the Ministry, did thus preach the Gospel, in times of extraordinary necessity, why might not <HI>Philip,</HI> (when driven from <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> and so ceasing to perform his Deacon's Of∣fice there) preach the Gospel at <HI>Samaria,</HI> and yet not do it <HI>as a Deacon?</HI> Supposing <HI>Philip</HI> to be as yet no more than a Deacon, his preaching doth not any more argue that <HI>Deacons</HI> may ordinarily be Preachers, than that <HI>private Persons</HI> may be so.—But perhaps some will object, <HI>That</HI> Philip <HI>baptis'd as well as preach'd.</HI> To which I answer; In such an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Case, He might baptise as lawfully as preach. And such an extraordina∣ry Effusion of the Holy Ghost, and Power of work∣ing Miracles, as He had, would justify any Man's
<PB N="41" REF="002531_0042_0FDB5C2D1863F138"/>
doing both, in such a Case. The words of the late excellent Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. on <HI>Psalm.</HI> 144 15 (<HI>pag.</HI> 23.) preach'd <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> are remarkable; <Q>Has not every Christian, in cases of necessity, a <HI>Right</HI> to teach another, &amp; persuade him to be a Christian? And therefore, though it is a very just Part of the Order of the Church, that none but Persons initiated into holy Functions should baptize &amp; preach, yet <HI>Necessity is above all Rules:</HI> In such a Case they may baptize as well as preach. The Faith of the Trinity gives every Man a Right to baptize: and this has been the constant sense of the Church for above fourteen hundred years, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
There is no force then in the pretended Example of Scripture-Deacons, to prove that Deacons as such, &amp; in ordinary Cases may preach &amp; baptize. But says our Author they are vested with Power to do this, <HI>by their Ordination.</HI> By which he must mean either the <HI>Apostolical</HI> Ordination, or the <HI>Church of England</HI>-Ordination. I think He could not mean the <HI>Former;</HI> because in the beginning of the same Paragraph, he owns that the <HI>first In∣stitution of that order in the Church, was to take Care of the Poor:</HI> and indeed He must have been strange∣ly blind or wilful, if he had deny'd this. For no∣thing can be more evident from the Institution (<HI>Act.</HI> 6.) than that Deacons originally were Over∣seers of the <HI>Poor,</HI> &amp; ordain'd to <HI>serve Tables,</HI> which the Apostles wou'd not <HI>leave the Word of God</HI> to do. <Q>But in process of Time, (says one) when the Revenues of the Church were enlarg'd, the Case was greatly alter'd: the Bishops affected to be Guardians of the Poor, and to make the Dea∣cons Amends admitted them to preach &amp; bap∣tize. The Bishops omit Preaching, &amp; become
<PB N="42" REF="002531_0043_0FDB5C2F69AAFE00"/>
servants of Tables: and the Deacons from serving of Tables step up into the Pulpit &amp; be∣come Preachers.</Q> Agreebly the Church of <HI>England</HI> allows her Deacons to be Preachers and Baptiser. And most probably it might be <HI>Her Ordination,</HI> which our Author refer'd to when he said that Deacons, are <HI>by their Ordination, vested with a power of preaching by the Bishops Licence.</HI> But then I ask, What Authority hath the Church to <HI>alter</HI> Divine Institutions? If the Institution (in <HI>Acts</HI> 6.) doth not give Deacons such a Power, I desire our Author to shew me what <HI>Commission</HI> the Church of <HI>England</HI> hath to give it them: and if he cannot produce any Com∣mission to warrant the Church's giving it them, than the Bishop's Licence is but Vanity &amp; Pre∣sumption, &amp; the <HI>Episcopal Deacons</HI> are condemned out of our Author's own mouth, in that passage, [<HI>pag.</HI> 93.] <Q>Whoever pretends to exercise any part of the Ministerial Office, without a <HI>re∣gular</HI> Delegation or Mission, is an <HI>Intruder into the Priests Office,</HI> &amp; every <HI>Act</HI> of his is <HI>Null</HI> &amp; <HI>Void,</HI> &amp; in the Scripture-style <HI>an abomination to the Lord.</HI></Q>—We may borrow a few more words from him (out of the next page) &amp; say to Him &amp; his Brethren, <Q>Therefore I beseech you to look to it; for though you may amuse your selves, &amp; the world, with a Legal Establishment, I shall take the Liberty to say (with all due Regard &amp; Submission to the Civil Power) that what our Blessed Savior has commanded, [or insti∣tuted] <HI>No Power on Earth can make void:</HI> and what He or his Apostles have either by express words, or necessary Consequence forbidden, <HI>No Law of Man can make <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI></Q>— I'll add here, those words in the <HI>Modest Proof,</HI> (pag. 30 <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.)

<Q>You know what a dreadful Curse is pronounced against them who either <HI>add to,</HI> or <HI>take away from,</HI> the Institutions of Jesus Christ, in <HI>Rev.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, 19.— This is to pretend to be wiser <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ.</Q>—How then are Prelatical Churches to be condemn'd, that so <Q>confound and jumble together the different Orders instituted by Christ, &amp; set up a new Model different from what he established:</Q>—in which the Dea∣cons are made <HI>half Priests,</HI> &amp; the Priests but <HI>half Ministers</HI> &amp; mere Curates to the Bishops: while the <HI>Bishops</HI> have an <HI>over-grown</HI> Power; part whereof they commit to <HI>Lay-Officers,</HI> who take Care generally to employ it upon the Inferior Clergy &amp; People with a wholesome Severity, so far as this will make for their own Interest.</P>
<P>I shall now dismiss my Author with a word or two, up∣on the <HI>Conclusion</HI> of his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Proof,</HI> which is as full of Ill Nature, &amp; foolish Bigotry, as his preceding Discourse is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Truth and Honesty. <Q>I have (says he to us) insisted the longer upon these three Orders of Gospel-Mi∣nisters, to shew you (if possible) your Error, <HI>in setting up Ministers to your <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who have <HI>no Mission,</HI></HI>— and <HI>of the Danger you are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for want of Gospel Ordinances.</HI></Q> Then follows this fatal Climax, <Q>If you have <HI>no Ordination,</HI> you can have no <HI>lawful Ministers;</HI> if you want lawful Ministers, you can have <HI>no Baptism;</HI> and without Baptism, you have no Title to <HI>the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Grace,</HI> in God's ordinary way of dealing with us.</Q> — <HI>Is this the Result, this the End</HI> of our pretended Error? We thank the Gentleman then for the <HI>Charity</HI> of his <HI>Persuasive:</HI> but we thank God more, that we know it is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>pretended Error,</HI> we are charg'd with, and only a <HI>supposed Danger,</HI> we are in. This we know and are sure of by the <HI>Scripture Evidence</HI> we bring for the Truth and Goodness of our <HI>Cause:</HI> and from the <HI>Success</HI> of the <HI>Ministry</HI> in our Churches; which has been such, for its De∣gree &amp; its Constancy, as (to speak modestly) has hardly ever been parallel'd in any Episcopal Church on the face of the Earth. This is a Consideration that will weigh much with serious thinking People and will weigh down a thousand Cavils against our Ministry and Churches.</P>
<P>BUT I'll now finish with some remarkable Lines out of two or three famous Authors. <HI>End,</HI> Bishop <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> in his Ser∣mon
<PB N="44" REF="002531_0045_0FDC2338E38AFBD8"/>
before quoted [<HI>pag.</HI> 22,] speaking of the <HI>Papists,</HI> ob∣serves; — <Q>They condemn without Mercy all who differ from them: They damn them first, and then persecute them without Bowels. They think their Communion is the one Church, out of which there is no Salvation.</Q>
He adds; <Q><HI>I wish none of <HI>their Leaven</HI> may be <HI>fermenting among Vs:</HI></HI> In this Last Particular, a Notion begins to be spread among us, that goes <HI>further</HI> even than <HI>their</HI> Un∣charitableness. <HI>They</HI> only deny that those who are not of their Body are <HI>Catholicks:</HI> but there is a Conceit lately got in among us, that denies all who are not baptized among <HI>Us</HI> [that is, in the Church of England] to be <HI>Christians,</HI> shuts them out of CHRIST's Covenant, and thinks them no better than Heathens. A Notion that tho' it once got into some Churches, who thought that the Baptism of Hereticks was of no Value, and ought to be repeated upon their Coming into the Church, yet was solemnly condemned and rejected by all the Churches of God now for above Fourteen Hundred Years. In Popery the Midwives gene∣rally baptize: yet, though this is against an express Rule of the Apostles, That a <HI>Woman ought not to speak in the Church,</HI> none of the Reformed ever thought of rebaptizing the Per∣sons so baptized: Nor did our Church at the <HI>Restoration</HI> ever entertain the least Motion of this sort. But now this is receiv'd by many, among the other wild Conceits of the Corrupter of our Faith &amp; Church, who broached <HI>this,</HI> with many other <HI>monstrous</HI> Errors, which he has carried so near Atheism, as to deny the Immortality of the Soul, and to put the Immortalizing Virtue in a Baptism given by Per∣sons Episcopally ordained.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE common Topick <HI>(adds the Bishop)</HI> for supporting this <HI>wild unheard of <HI>Paradox,</HI></HI> is, that the Commission to preach and baptize was given to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> so that none but their <HI>Successors</HI> can pretend to it. But has not every Christian, in cases of necessity, a Right <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>(The Rest you had before.)</P>
<P><Q>THIS is not the only step some are making towards <HI>Popery;</HI> but with so little Knowledge and Consideration, that it is to be hoped they do it ignorantly▪ misled by a great Name &amp; a shew of Learning; which many seem more willing to admire in others, than diligent to arrive at it themselves.</Q></P>
<P><Q>WHAT a Deluge of Infidelity has over-run the Land! And how great a Contempt of holy Things does appear every where bare faced, <HI>even among those</HI> who as far as Heat and Fury go, shew a Zeal, I had almost call'd it a <HI>Rage,</HI>

for our <HI>Church;</HI> tho' their Behaviour is a Disgrace, and their Lives a Reproach to it!</Q></P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Bishop.</HI></P>
<P>MY next Author is the Celebrated Monsieur <HI>Claude,</HI> who has such Words as these upon the matter. <Q>To speak my Thoughts freely; this <HI>Fierce</HI> Opinion (of the <HI>absolute necessity of Episcopacy</HI>) which wou'd make all Religion de∣pend on a <HI>Formality,</HI> of no other than human Institution, cannot be look'd on otherwise than as the <HI>very worst Cha∣racter,</HI> and a Mark of the <HI>grossest Hypocrisy;</HI> a piece of <HI>Pharisaism</HI> all over, that straits at a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> when it swallows a <HI>Camel.</HI> And I cannot avoid having at least a <HI>Contempt</HI> of those kind of Thoughts, and a <HI>Compassion</HI> for those that fill fill their heads with them.</Q></P>
<P>IN fine, says an Author of our own <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Seasonable Inquiries</HI> &amp;c. pag. 9, 11.</NOTE>. <Q>What are they doing <HI>[O vain Men, what are you doing?]</HI> who after the WORD of GOD in the sacred Scriptures doth so plainly &amp; loudly con∣demn the Usurpation of a <HI>Diocesan Episcopacy,</HI> will for the sake thereof renounce the Ministry and Communion of all the <HI>Protestant</HI> Churches in the World, except a very little Party on two Islands, which have so little Distinction of <HI>pure and undefiled Religion</HI> to invite a serious Christian over to it! And will unite with the <HI>Papists,</HI> our common Enemy <HI>[at such a time as this!]</HI> in the most compendious and effectual way of destroying the <HI>Reformation,</HI> and set up a <HI>Captain,</HI> un∣der whom a Return to <HI>Egypt</HI> may be soon accomplished!</Q></P>
