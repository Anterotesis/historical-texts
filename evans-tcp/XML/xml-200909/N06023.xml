<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Candid READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following <HI>Sermon</HI> needs no Commendation. The Truth, Weight and Seasonableness of its Matter, the So∣briety of its Stile, the Modesty of its Address, together with the Spirit of Piety, of Humility, of undisguised Zeal for God, and affectionate Love to Man, which breathes in every Part, and animates the Whole, will commend it to the Consciences of all that fear God, who have the Pleasure of perusing it. Here are no high sounding Words of Vanity, or little Artifices to exalt him∣self, and catch a vulgar Applause; but an honest, serious En∣deavour to honor God, and do good to Mankind.—Let not the pious Author be offended with our Freedom, in saying, that his Life adds Weight to this Discourse; for the Latter is but a Copy of the Former: Nor should it be forgotten, that the gracious God, who delights to honor the Humble and Sincere in Heart, gave manifest Tokens of his special Presence, when this Discourse was delivered: Not only the Speaker, but divers of the Hearers, both Ministers and People, being solemnly affected and tenderly touched with the precious Truths therein contained.—May God, of his infinite Mercy, keep these Things in the Imagination of the Thoughts of our Hearts, and enable us to act accordingly:
<PB N="iv" REF="007643_0003_102D97E77207B958"/>
May we, especially who are of the Sacred Order, obtain Mercy to be faithful, as well as prudent and humble unto Death.</P>
<P>There is nothing of greater Consequence to the Weal of the Churches, than taking due Care respecting the Admission of Can∣didates into the Ministry. If we are lax in this, and easly in∣troduce Persons who have no positive Evidences of vital Godli∣ness; Error will come in as a Flood, and inundate the Churches; experimental Piety gradually languish, and at last totally expire: To prevent which awful Events, may Al∣mighty GOD bless the following Discourse.—We add no more, but remain thy Servants for CHRIST's Sake.</P>

<HEAD>The FAITHFUL MINISTER Encouraged: A SERMON, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 CORINTH. iv. 1.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Therefore seeing we have this Ministry, as we have received Mercy, we faint not.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Dispensation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, <HI>Men, Brethren</HI> and <HI>Fathers,</HI> in several important respects, far excels in Glory the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Dispensa∣tion. This the Apostle had observed and clearly proved in the preceding Chapter, and from thence draws the just Conclusion in our Text, <HI>Therefore seeing we have this Ministry, as we have received Mercy, we faint not.</HI></P>
<P>Here we may observe several Things.</P>
<P N="1">1. We have the Gospel Ministry refer'd to, call'd, <HI>This Ministry.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Here are some engag'd in this Work: WE HAVE <HI>this Ministry.</HI> They are put in Trust with the Gospel <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Thes.</HI> ii. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">3. This is to be acknowledged as a Mercy from God: <HI>As we have</HI> RECEIVED MERCY, Some Expositors chuse to join this Sentence with the last Clause, thus; as <HI>we have re∣ceived Mercy, we faint not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007643_0005_102D97EC29ED8158"/><HI>These</HI> understood the Mercy here intended, to be, that of Ministers being kept from fainting under their Trials.</P>
<P><HI>Others</HI> join the two first Sentences in our Text together thus, <HI>Therefore seeing we have this Ministry, as we have re∣ceived Mercy.</HI> They conceive the Mercy here spoken of is that of being call'd and employ'd in the sacred Work. <HI>Be∣za</HI>'s Judgment in particular is mentioned in the Continuati∣on of <HI>Poole</HI>'s Annotations, in these Words; <Q>The Tradu∣cers of this great Apostle took Advantage from his great Trials and Afflictions, by reason of them, to conclude him no such Man, as he was by some represented; and the Apostle upon that takes Advantage to magnify his Office. God <HI>(saith he)</HI> having intrusted us with so <HI>glorious</HI> a Mini∣stration, as I have proved that of the <HI>Gospel</HI> to be, according to the Measure and Proportion of Gifts and Graces, which God hath bestowed upon us, or by reason of that infinite Grace and Mercy, which God hath shewed us, in calling us to so <HI>honorable</HI> a Station and Of∣fice, though we meet with many Adversaries, many Af∣flictions, many Difficulties, yet we bear up, and sink not under them, nor faint in our Spirits because of them.</Q></P>
<P>Thus far he. In this Sense I propose to consider the Words of our Text.</P>
<P N="4">4. We may observe, that great Difficulties must be ex∣pected in the Work of the Gospel Ministry, or there would be no Danger of <HI>Fainting.</HI></P>
<P>Again, that we ought not to faint under these Difficulties and Trials, but should be able to say, through Grace, with the Apostle, <HI>we faint not.</HI></P>
<P>And further, that an excellent Argument against <HI>Fainting</HI> in this Work, may be drawn from the Gospel Ministry it∣self, and the several Motives, that relate to it. <HI>Therefore seeing we have this Ministry, we faint not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="007643_0006_102D97EDC1772AF8"/><HI>Lastly,</HI> That faithful Ministers are kept from <HI>Fainting,</HI> by these precious Truths and Motives set home with divine Pow∣er on their Souls; hence they can say with the Apostle, <HI>We faint not;</HI> otherwise we should surely <HI>faint.</HI></P>
<P>I might comprize these important Observations in a gene∣ral One, and lay it down as the Foundation of the present Discourse; but as that would open too large a Field for this Opportunity, I shall <HI>confine</HI> myself to the Consideration and Improvement of these two Things, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Mercy</HI> of being call'd to the Work of the Gospel Ministry, and some of the <HI>Reasons</HI> and <HI>Arguments</HI> which are adapted to guard a∣gainst extreme Discouragements, and to excite to active and persevering Diligence and Faithfulness in the Work.</P>
<P>And here I would humbly and earnestly intreat my reve∣rend <HI>Fathers</HI> and <HI>Brethren</HI> (with others of <HI>God's People</HI> pre∣sent) to lift up your Hearts with Faith and Fervency to the God of all Grace and Fulness in Jesus Christ, that I may be enabled so to <HI>speak</HI> on these Heads, and you so to hear, as that our Souls may be much quickened and animated in our Work, in order to the saving Good of many Souls, and the Advancement of the Divine Glory in the World.</P>
<P>I am, according to the Method propos'd,</P>
<P N="1">1. To consider it as a <HI>Mercy</HI> to faithful Ministers of the Gospel, that they have <HI>this Ministry,</HI> that they are call'd to this Work. <HI>We have this Ministry, as we have received Mer∣cy,</HI> saith our Text. God in his Mercy is set forth by an ex∣cellent Divine, as God willing to succour sinful Men in their Misery. And how is this remarkably manifested to, and ex∣perienced by such of the sinful miserable Sons of Men, as are prepared for, and improved in the ministerial Work. Thus the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> with respect to the glorious Gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to his Trust, says, <HI>I thank Jesus Christ our Lord, who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the Ministry</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 11, 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="007643_0007_102D97EFEC840EA0"/>Indeed, when Men rush into the Ministry, without the Qualifications which the Word of God requires; they act a most foolish Part, and a Part most dangerous and pernici∣ous, both to themselves and others: But when they are en∣dow'd with those Qualifications, and withal set apart to the sacred Work by Fasting and Prayer, and the laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> xiv. 23. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 14.</NOTE> they may well be drawn out in Thankfulness to God and Christ, on the Account, and say, This is a <HI>Mercy,</HI> a <HI>great Mercy,</HI> confer'd on us <HI>unworthy, vile and sinful</HI> Dust, <HI>that unto us is committed the Ministry of Reconciliation</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 18, 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This the Ambassadors of Christ justly esteem a <HI>Mercy,</HI> as it respects <HI>themselves,</HI> as it respects <HI>others,</HI> and as they may thus in an <HI>eminent</HI> Degree promote the <HI>Divine Glory</HI> in the World.</P>
<P N="1">1. As it respects <HI>themselves.</HI></P>
<P>What a Mercy is it to be call'd to a Work, which is cal∣culated to promote their Increase of <HI>Grace</HI> as well as <HI>Gifts?</HI> And what a <HI>Comfort</HI> must it be to the faithful Ministers of the Gospel, to consider, that their <HI>general</HI> and <HI>particular</HI> Callings do happily coincide and subserve each other? Their general Calling, the Care of <HI>their own</HI> Souls, their particular Calling, the Care of <HI>others</HI> Souls. The more closely they walk with God themselves, so much the more faithful and engag'd they are in their Work, and the more likely to be successful; and on the other Hand, the more faithful they are in their Work, through Grace, so much the more <HI>they grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Pet.</HI> iii. 18.</NOTE>. So much the more <HI>their Souls prosper and are in Health</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Epist. of John v. <HI>2.</HI></NOTE> and ordinarily the more they enjoy the <HI>Consolations</HI> of the Divine Spirit, <HI>which are not small,</HI> the more their Light shines before others, and they adorn their
<PB N="9" REF="007643_0008_102D97F2765A2B58"/>
Profession, and the more they are attemper'd to the heaven∣ly State, and prepared for eternal Glory.</P>
<P>'Tis true they are from several Quarters beset at times with Temptations, perhaps more so than others; as Officers in an Army are more aim'd and pointed at by the Enemy than private Soldiers; but these Temptations their great Lord and Leader wisely permits, to <HI>prove</HI> them, and bring them to know more of themselves, that they may take root downwards, in order to bear Fruit upwards; he shews them thus their own Insufficiency, and leads them to depend up∣on his All-sufficiency in the New Covenant, and hereupon they find him <HI>a very present Help in Trouble</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal</HI> xlvi. 1.</NOTE>: They are thus humbled and purified, and made more meet for their Master's Service, more watchful and circumspect, more pa∣tient and resign'd under Trials and Sufferings, and more di∣ligent in their Work, and probably more successful too; and this is a <HI>great Mercy,</HI></P>
<P>Again, the Ministers of Jesus Christ, are to <HI>give themselves to reading, to Meditation and Prayer;</HI> and how may they thus, through the divine Blessing, grow apace, both in doc∣trinal and experimental Knowledge, yea, I may add, in e∣very Christian Grace and Virtue? And is not this a <HI>great Mercy?</HI></P>
<P>It is a further Comfort and a Mercy too, that we, who have <HI>this Ministry,</HI> may be preaching to ourselves, as well as praying over the Sermons we prepare for, and preach to others; yea, we may see more clearly the beautiful Harmo∣ny and Connection of divine Truths, as well as feel more of the happy Effects of them; while we are attending on the Exposition of sacred Scripture, and when catechising our People, or making Preparations therefor.</P>
<P>In the Administration of divine Ordinances, especially the Sacraments of the New Testament, how may we reap much Profit and Pleasure ourselves, through Grace, see more of
<PB N="10" REF="007643_0009_102D97F408F171A8"/>
the Faithfulness, Grace, Holiness, and other Perfections of our God and Saviour; and grow more holy, comfortable and fruitful.</P>
<P>In our <HI>Pastoral Visits</HI> we may often, through Divine As∣sistance, caution and comfort, direct and edify others and ourselves at the same Time,</P>
<P>And in the Discipline of God's House, while we endea∣vour to reclaim others, we may be not a little guarded and benefited ourselves: We may be led to see much of the Ag∣gravations and Evil of Sin, the Snares that lie thick around, the constant Necessity of Watchfulness and Prayer, and of living by Faith on God in Christ; that we may as <HI>Christians,</HI> and as <HI>Ministers,</HI> bring forth much Fruit.</P>
<P>In a Word, <HI>every</HI> Part of the ministerial Work is in some respect or other adapted to promote our increasing Conformi∣ty to the Perfections and Will of God in our Hearts and Lives: Is it not then a <HI>Mercy,</HI> a <HI>great Mercy,</HI> that we have been call'd to this Work? <HI>We have this Ministry, as we have received Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>Though it is a difficult, yet it is also a delightful and use∣ful, as well as honourable Work; and it is a <HI>Mercy,</HI> not only with respect to <HI>us,</HI> but also,</P>
<P N="2">2. With respect to <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>It is truly adapted, both in the public and private Parts of it, as a Means to promote the best, the everlasting Interests of all our Hearers; but Men are hardened by Sin and Unbelief, and blinded by Satan and the World: <HI>They hate the Light, and will not come to the Light, lest their Deeds should be repro∣ved</HI> <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> iii. 20.</NOTE>. And nothing short of the Almighty Energy of the Holy Ghost, will make the Word effectual to saving Purpo∣ses; well may the <HI>Regenerate</HI> then be said to be <HI>born of the Spirit</HI> <NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> iii. 5, 8.</NOTE>. <HI>By Grace we are saved, through Faith,
<PB N="11" REF="007643_0010_102D97F5928F09A0"/>
and that not of ourselves, it is the Gift of God: Not of Works, lest any Man should boast</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 8, 9.</NOTE>. But as the Spirit makes Use of the Word, so we are said to be <HI>born again by the Word of God, and begotten through the Gospel</HI> <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Pet.</HI> i. 23. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iv. 15.</NOTE>. And Faith is said to <HI>come by Hearing, and Hearing by the Word of God; for how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a Preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be sent</HI> <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> x. 17, 14, 15.</NOTE>? The Apostle was not <HI>ashamed of the Gospel of Christ, for,</HI> says he, <HI>it is the Power of God unto Salvation to every one that believeth</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><L>Very just then is the Conclusion drawn by the pious and ingenious <HI>Watts,</HI></L>
<L>Should all the Forms that Men devise,</L>
<L>Assault my Faith with treach'rous Art,</L>
<L>I'd call them Vanity and Lies,</L>
<L>And bind the Gospel to my Heart.</L></NOTE>; <HI>and to these we are the Savour of Life unto Life,</HI> through rich Grace, although to others <HI>the Savour of Death unto Death</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> i. 16. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We are call'd in the ministerial Work, as Instruments to <HI>instruct</HI> the Ignorant, to <HI>convince</HI> the Erroneous, to <HI>reclaim</HI> the Vicious, to <HI>awaken</HI> the Secure, to <HI>rouze</HI> the Slothful, to <HI>sap</HI> the Foundation of Hypocrites, and to <HI>shew</HI> the Self-righteous their extream and destructive Folly; and though this is truly hard Work, yet it must be done in God's Strength, and when done and blest, very useful.</P>
<P>It is further useful and pleasant withal, to <HI>direct</HI> enquiring Souls to Christ, to <HI>win</HI> them over to him, through his all-powerful Grace, that they may receive him in his most glorious Person and precious Benefits, as he is offer'd in the Gospel: And what a <HI>Mercy</HI> is this both to us and them.</P>
<P>Again, we are call'd as Instruments, to <HI>build up</HI> the Saints in Faith, and Holiness, and Comfort. We are to <HI>comfort</HI> them in their Trials from within and without, <HI>with the
<PB N="12" REF="007643_0011_102D97F8CF1897F0"/>
same Consolations, wherewith we ourselves are comforted of God.</HI> And is it not a Favour to be made thus useful to God's Peo∣ple? We were call'd in our Work <HI>to carry the Lambs in our Bosom, and gently to lead those that are with Young,</HI> after the Example and under the Influence of the great, the chief Shepherd <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> xl. 2.</NOTE>. We are to give <HI>Milk to Babes,</HI> as well as <HI>strong Meat</HI> to the more grown <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 1, 2.</NOTE> to <HI>strengthen</HI> the Weak, to <HI>fix</HI> the Wavering, to <HI>guide</HI> the Doubting, to <HI>quicken</HI> the Backward, to <HI>succour</HI> the Tempted, to <HI>direct</HI> Believers to <HI>be strong,</HI> not in the Grace they have received, but <HI>in the Grace which is in Christ Jesus;</HI> and to be engaged, through Grace, in improving the Comforts they enjoy, as Encouragements and Means to an higher End, even Holiness and the Divine Glory. Thus our Work, the <HI>ministerial</HI> Work is adapted, and thus it is blest to the Benefit of many Souls: We may justly say then, <HI>We have this Ministry, as we have received Mercy:</HI> Especially since,</P>
<P N="3">3. We may, with Divine Assistance, by and in this Work, in an <HI>eminent</HI> Degree promote the <HI>Divine Glory</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>How is the Glory of God and Christ and true <HI>Religion</HI> ma∣nifested by our Increase in Gifts and Grace, in Holiness and Usefulness Thence it appears in some Measure what a Mas∣ter we serve, what a God we worship, what a Saviour we preach and offer, what a <HI>Religion</HI> we profess and recom∣mend.</P>
<P><HI>My Brethren,</HI> certainly God is the greatest and best of Be∣ings; surely then, the setting him forth to be, or manifest∣ing him as such, is the greatest and highest End that can be: This is his Glory, this End is worthy of a God, and this is the highest End of all his Friends, Children and Servants: This End, the Work of the Ministry, is wonderfully suited and blest to promote: What a <HI>Mercy</HI> is it then to any of us <HI>vile, apostate</HI> and <HI>perishing</HI> Sons of Men, to be brought
<PB N="13" REF="007643_0012_102D97FB5664E130"/>
home to Christ, and call'd to this sacred Work. <HI>We have this Ministry, as we have received Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>I would here make two <HI>Remarks</HI> on this Head, before we pass to the next.</P>
<P N="1">1. We may plainly see, that we who are in the <HI>Ministry,</HI> have no reason to <HI>think highly</HI> of ourselves, no reason to be <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>Vain-glorious.</HI> We should indeed take Care to <HI>magnify our Office,</HI> and in no Instances or respects to under-act the sacred Character; but at the same Time, the Lan∣guage of each of our Souls, must be that of <HI>Job, Behold I am vile</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>Job</HI> xl. 4.</NOTE> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><Q>It is a divine as well as wise and just Remark made by one of the greatest <HI>Masters</HI> of <HI>Thought</HI> in the last Age, that Persons of <HI>Quality</HI> and Character ought to have two Setts of Thoughts by which to regulate their Conduct: By the <HI>one</HI> they are to view themselves in their State of distinguishing <HI>Elevation,</HI> which is not from Nature, but arbitrary <HI>Establishment;</HI> by the <HI>other</HI> they are to take a Prospect of themselves in their natural Condition of <HI>Infirmity</HI> and <HI>Equality,</HI> with the rest of Mankind.</Q> (And I may here add, of Sin and Misery▪ Pemberton<HI>'s Election Sermon, p.</HI> 1.</NOTE>. The Temper of our Minds, and the Tenor of our Lives, should be humble and holy. How should we be <HI>clothed with Humility,</HI> as it were from Head to Foot, who are Ministers of the <HI>meek and lowly</HI> Jesus: How should we watch and pray against Pride, hate and shun this vile <HI>Monster</HI> and this dangerous Snare, this awful <HI>Condemnation of the De∣vil.</HI> Let us often think, for our Humiliation, <HI>What have we,</HI> that is in any Measure good and valuable, <HI>that we have not received?</HI> And again, what have we that we have not misimproved? And as to the Gospel Ministry, it will be a special Guard against Pride, to realize, through Grace, how we came by it, namely, by <HI>meer undeserved Mercy,</HI> and shall we be proud of Mercy? <HI>We have this Ministry only as we have received Mercy.</HI> Where is Boasting then? It is ex∣cluded.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="14" REF="007643_0013_102D97FD95AAE7D0"/>2. Hence we may observe Ground of peculiar Encourage∣ment in the Work of the Ministry amidst all the Difficulties that attend it. <HI>We have this Ministry, as we have received Mercy;</HI> and is it a Mercy we have it, and shall we be dis∣couraged with it? Shall we be discouraged with Mercy? <HI>Therefore let us not faint.</HI></P>
<P>With this Thought we come by an easy Transition, to the</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>General Head,</HI> under which I am to consider and set be∣fore you some of the many <HI>Reasons</HI> and <HI>Arguments</HI> inducing to Faithfulness in the Ministerial Work: And here,</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Command</HI> in God's Word should powerfully and constantly engage to be <HI>faithful</HI> and not <HI>faint</HI> in this great Work. This Command we have in these Words <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xxviii. 19, 20. <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 28. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 1, 2, 5,</NOTE> <HI>Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all Things whatsoever I have commanded you.</HI> And in another Place, <HI>Take heed to yourselves, and to all the Flock, over which the Holy Ghost hath made You Overseers, to feed the Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own Blood.</HI> And again, <HI>I charge thee before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, who shall judge the Quick and the Dead at his Appearing, and his King∣dom: Preach the Word, be instant in Season, and out of Season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all Long-suffering and Doctrine. Watch thou in all Things, endure Afflictions, do the Work of an Evangelist, make full Proof of thy Ministry.</HI> With many other Passages to the same Purpose. Surely, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> the Mind and Will of the Lord, infinitely glorious in him∣self, and withal our Maker, Preserver, and Governor, Be∣nefactor and <HI>Redeemer,</HI> thus revealed in his Word, should engage us, through Grace, to chearful, constant and faithful Obedience. <HI>Therefore seeing we have this Ministry, as we have received Mercy, let us not faint.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="007643_0014_102D97FF4DBFA740"/>2. The <HI>Example of Christ</HI> should animate us in the mini∣sterial Work.</P>
<P>Here we have a perfect Pattern to copy after. The bles∣sed Jesus discover'd from Time to Time the most ardent Love to God and Man in his more public and private Trans∣actions and Ministrations, and sought not his own Glory, but the Glory of him that sent him; so should we, through his Grace.</P>
<P>How zealous and couragious was he, and yet how pru∣dent and discreet? How plain and pungent, and yet how compassionate, how regardless of the Flatteries or Frowns of the World? how meek and lowly of Heart? how faithful in the Discharge of personal and relative Duties? how holy and pure? how resigned to his Heavenly Father's Disposal? how frequent and fervent in Prayer, and how laborious in his beloved Work? <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xi. 4. <HI>John</HI> iv. 34.</NOTE> <HI>I must work,</HI> says he, <HI>the Works of him that sent me, while it is Day.</HI> And again, <HI>My Meat is to do the Will of him that sent me, and to finish his Work.</HI></P>
<P>How willing was he to do and suffer what he was call'd to, even to the Death?

<P N="3">3. The <HI>Example of Christ's faithful Servants</HI> in the Mini∣stry should animate us in the Work. 'Tis true, <HI>my Bre∣thren,</HI> the best of Christ's Ministers are imperfect in the pre∣sent State, and therefore not to be propos'd as perfect Pat∣terns

<P>What a lovely Example is set before us in our Text, and the following Verse; <HI>Therefore seeing we have this</HI> Ministry, <HI>as we have received</HI> Mercy, <HI>we faint not: But have renounced the hidden Things of Dishonesty, not walking in Craftiness, nor handling the Word of God deceitfully, but by manifestation of the Truth, commending ourselves to every man's Conscience in the Sight of God.</HI> And again, in the same Epistle, <HI>We do all Things, dearly Beloved, for your Edifying</HI> <NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 19.</NOTE>. <HI>Our Exhort∣ation,</HI> saith this great Apostle of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> in another E∣pistle <NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Thes.</HI> ii. 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10.</NOTE> <HI>was not of Deceit, nor of Uncleanness, nor in Guile, but as we were allowed of God to be put in Trust with the Gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing Men, but God, which trieth our Hearts. For neither at any Time used we flattering Words, as ye know, nor a Cloke of Covetousness; God is Witness. Nor of men sought we Glory, neither of you, nor yet of others: Be∣ing affectionately desirous of You, we were willing to have im∣parted unto You, not the Gospel of God only, but also our own Souls, because Ye were dear unto us.

<P>Oh! how willing have the faithful Servants of the dear <HI>Redeemer</HI> been in the primitive Times, and since, <HI>to keep un∣der their Bodies</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ix. 27.</NOTE> to live near to God, <HI>to spend and be spent</HI> in the Service of Christ and of Souls; and even when call'd to it, to seal the Truth with their Blood.</P>
<P>We have great reason, my <HI>Brethren,</HI> to bless God, that a considerable Number of the Ministers of the Gospel, in <HI>Great-Britain and America</HI> have, in our Day, been much engag'd in the Cause of God; among these may be reckon'd godly Mr. <HI>Whitefield,</HI> whose <HI>indefatigable</HI> and <HI>successful</HI> La∣bours, for almost <HI>twenty</HI> Years together, should be improv'd for the Encouragement and Quickening of all truly engag'd in the sacred Work; whose Name is justly very dear to us: May God Almighty always keep him, with other his Ser∣vants, humble; bless them, and make them Blessings, and that more and more abundantly, <HI>to the Praise of his Glory in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>While we are musing on these Things, let the <HI>Fire</HI> of Divine Love and Zeal be enkindled in our Breasts, and burn vigorously, that we may be sweetly constrained to say, <HI>Therefore seeing we have this</HI> Ministry, <HI>as we have received</HI> Mercy, <HI>we faint not, and, throngh Grace, we will not faint.</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="18" REF="007643_0017_102D9809275A99A8"/>4. The <HI>Example</HI> of the <HI>holy Angels,</HI> should quicken us in our Work. They are Messengers of the Lord, as their Name imports; in several respects their Work and ours re∣semble each other; no Wonder then, that Ministers of the Gospel are called <HI>Angels</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> i. 20.</NOTE>.

<P N="5">5. The Industry and Malice, Subtilty and Success of the Devil in his Attempts to ruin Mens Souls, should engage us the more in faithful Endeavours, that they may be rescu∣ed and saved; or in other Words, should quicken us to Diligence in our Work.</P>

<P>Is the Devil, the Enemy of all Good, an Adversary to Souls? Shall not we Ministers of the Gospel be <HI>Friends</HI> to them?</P>
<P>Is he, with his Instruments, set with Boldness, like Li∣ons, against Souls? Sha'n't <HI>we</HI> be couragious as Lions in go∣ing through all Difficulties to promote their saving Good?

If we, <HI>Brethren,</HI> should faint, the De∣vil will not; <HI>Therefore seeing we have this</HI> Ministry, <HI>as we have received</HI> Mercy. <HI>let us not saint.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>The Worth of Souls</HI> should engage Ministers of the Gospel to Faithfulness in their Work. The great Worth of Souls makes the Devil so eager to destroy them.</P>
<P>This makes the holy Angels engag'd for their Good; this causes <HI>Joy in Heaven on</HI> their <HI>Conversion.</HI> Here are two Worlds at Strife; about what? about earthly Crowns and Scepters? no! these are Trifles. About what then? The
<PB N="20" REF="007643_0019_102D980CC5A06630"/>
Souls of Men, whose Worth is exceeding great. What are <HI>all the Kingdoms of the World, and Glory of them,</HI> in Compa∣rison with the Soul? If you put these in one Scale, and the Soul in the other, they come up light as Vanity itself.</P>
<P>Our Blessed Saviour has determined this Point, both by his Words and Practice; by his Practice, when he pour'd Contempt on the World; but laid down his precious Life, and shed his Heart's Blood, to redeem and save perishing Souls:—By his Words, which are these <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mutthew</HI> xvi. 26.</NOTE> <HI>What is a Man profited, if he shall gain the whole World, and lose his own Soul? Or what shall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul?</HI></P>
<P>Oh! Shall we not be engaged then, agreeable to the De∣sign of our Commission, and from a Sense of the Worth of Souls, in the most painful and faithful Endeavours, through divine assisting Grace, <HI>to open Mens Eyes, and to turn them from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God, that they may receive Forgiveness of Sins, and Inheritance among them that are sanctified by Faith which is in Christ. Therefore, beloved Brethren, seeing we have this</HI> Ministry, <HI>as we have received</HI> Mercy, <HI>let us not faint.</HI></P>

the Using. What Pains will Men take, yea, what Ha∣zards will they run, in pursuit of "glittering Gems, gaudy Honors, and shining Dust," which after all are Vanity? How will Men be at vast Expence and Labour, some Way or other, to please and pamper their Bodies, which yet must soon moulder into their kindred Dust; and shall not we be as much, nay more concern'd about their precious Souls, that must surely live forever, either in a State of Happiness, or Misery<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><L>Beware what Earth calls Happiness; beware</L>

<P>Again, <HI>the Sufficiency of Divine Grace</HI> held forth to us in the <HI>precious Promises</HI> of God's Word, should comfort and a∣nimate us in our Work. Many and great are our Trials and Difficulties from without and within, and they often meet and join their Forces; we may well say then, <HI>Who is sufficient for these Things</HI> <NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 16.</NOTE>? And we should surely sink, had we not a more than human Prop, at such a Time, a divine Support; such as <HI>Paul</HI> had given him, when afflicted with <HI>a Thorn in the Flesh, the Messenger of Satan to buffet</HI> him: When in this Distress, he <HI>besought the Lord thrice,</HI> he had this Answer <NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 9,</NOTE> <HI>My Grace is sufficient for thee, for my Strength is made perfect in Weakness.</HI> How is it with <HI>Paul</HI> now? he is kept from fainting, he is refresh'd, he even re∣joices and triumphs, and gives God the Glory; <HI>Most gladly therefore,</HI> says he, <HI>will I rather glory in my Infirmities, that the Power of Christ may rest upon me.</HI> Again he tells us else∣where,
<PB N="22" REF="007643_0021_102D9811110EE9B0"/>
where <NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Phil.</HI> iv. 13.</NOTE> <HI>He can do all Things, through Christ, which strengtheneth him;</HI> so may we too, living by Faith on the same <HI>Mediator of the New Covenant,</HI> which is <HI>well ordered in all Things, and sure:</HI> Let us then <HI>trust in the Lord for ever; in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting Strength</HI> <NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> xxvi. 4.</NOTE>.

Therefore, seeing we have this Ministry,</HI> and these Supports and Encourage∣ments, <HI>as we have received Mercy, we faint not.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>surrounding Dangers</HI> join'd to the last Con∣sideration, should engage us to Faithfulness in our Work. Indeed Dangers in themselves tend to damp and discourage, but when they meet with a Mind prepar'd for them, they serve to quicken and animate. This is remarkable in Per∣sons of a martial Spirit; I may instance in <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> who in a Time of great and uncommon Peril, breaks out into this Expression, <HI>Hoc est periculum, par animo Alex∣andri:</HI> <Q>This is a Danger fit for the Spirit of an <HI>Alexander</HI> to encounter.</Q></P>
<P>As the Devil would fain ruin Souls, so he would fain keep Ministers of the Word from being faithful; and often <HI>stands at their Right-hand to resist them</HI> <NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><HI>Zech.</HI> iii. 1.</NOTE>. The remains of Corruption within us, give great Strength to his Temptati∣ons; and the Difficulty and Danger is increas'd by the World; I mean by the Fears and the Hopes of the present State. Oh! what Need have we to live near to God, that we may be well supplied and fortified against these Assaults; and likewise strength'ned and engaged through Grace, to
<PB N="23" REF="007643_0022_102D981310D61EA0"/>
<HI>pluck</HI> Souls as <HI>Brands out of the Burning,</HI> and to use skilfully and faithfully those <HI>Weapons</HI> of Doctrine and Discipline, <HI>which are not carnal, but mighty, through God, to the pulling down of strong Holds</HI> <NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 4.</NOTE> the strong Holds of Sin, especially Licentiousness and Self-righteousness, and of Satan and the World, who are join'd in a most dismal and dangerous Con∣federacy.</P>
<P>Again, the <HI>Dangers</HI> that at present <HI>surround our Land and Nation,</HI> should deeply affect us, and engage us in en∣creasing Zeal, Labours and Faithfulness.</P>
<P>We are indeed blest with very great Privileges both <HI>civil and sacred,</HI> under the Smiles of <HI>indulgent Heaven,</HI> and the mild and just Administration of the <HI>best of Kings,</HI> who may well be stiled a Father of his People; but the haughty, perfidious and cruel <HI>French,</HI> with their Confederates, are bent upon rending these Privileges if possible from us; up∣on destroying our <HI>Lives,</HI> or, which ought to be much dear∣er to us, <HI>our Liberty and our Religion.</HI></P>
<P>An holy and righteous God, tho' he has favour'd us with some <HI>remarkable</HI> Instances of undeserved Goodness and Suc∣cess in the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>North;</HI> for which we ought surely to return him our most grateful Acknowledgments in Heart, Lip and Life; yet because of the many and grievous Sins of this Land and Nation has suffer'd our Enemies to gain some Advantages against us, especially in our late <HI>awful</HI> Defeat to the <HI>Westward.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we see in some Measure what we are when left to ourselves; but <HI>Wo</HI> will be indeed to us <HI>if God depart from us</HI> <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hos.</HI> ix. 12.</NOTE> and a Deluge of <HI>Popery, Tyranny</HI> and <HI>Slavery</HI> overwhelm us.</P>
<P>Our Danger is evidently <HI>much</HI> encreased by the aforesaid <HI>terrible</HI> Frown of Divine Providence; but what makes our
<PB N="24" REF="007643_0023_102D98162326CB68"/>
Case most of all <HI>dark and dismal</HI> is this, <HI>viz.</HI> Our continuing in general <HI>stupid and unreform'd, unbelieving and impenitent</HI> under this late <HI>awful</HI> Judgment, added to the <HI>Drought,</HI> and to other Judgments sent before, as well as under the many and great <HI>Mercies</HI> and <HI>Privileges</HI> we have long enjoy'd, and long <HI>abus'd</HI> and <HI>misimprov'd,</HI> which the Lord in his Provi∣dence therefore loudly threatens to take from us, to with∣draw his gracious Influence and Protection at once, and what would then be left behind, but <HI>Darkness and Perplexi∣ty, Confusion and Horror, Desolation and Misery?</HI></P>
<P>In this Day of Darkness and Gloominess, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> we should be deeply humbled and penitent ourselves, and faith∣fully promote others being so. In this Day of <HI>imminent</HI> Danger, let us not fail to sound the <HI>Alarm</HI> with Faithfulness and Compassion, with Plainness and Pungency. Let us <HI>cry aloud, and not spare</HI> <NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> lviii. 1.</NOTE> let us <HI>shew</HI> to our People, and the People of this Land and Nation, <HI>their Transgressions and</HI> their <HI>Sins,</HI> Sins against God's Law and against his Grace, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and let us, through Grace, be more faithful than ever in our Labours, both in public and private for the good of dear precious Souls: And how should we <HI>Brethren</HI> withal, as <HI>Daniel</HI> successfully did <NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dan.</HI> ix. 3, 20.</NOTE> <HI>set our Face to the Lord God,</HI> to seek by Prayer and <HI>Supplication, with Fasting</HI> and Humiliati∣on, and <HI>confessing our Sin, and the</HI> Sin of our People.</P>
<P>Thus let us <HI>stand in the Gap,</HI> as well as <HI>on the Watch Tower: For Zion's Sake we will not hold our Peace, and for Jerusalem's Sake we will not rest, until the Righteousness thereof go forth as Brightness, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burn∣eth</HI> <NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> lxii. 1.</NOTE>. <HI>Therefore seeing we have this Ministry, as we have re∣ceived Mercy, we faint not,</HI> and, thro' Grace, we will not faint.</P>

<P N="1">1. Hence we learn, what young Men should have a true and just Sense of, who are about to enter upon the Work of the Gospel Ministry; even of these important Arguments and Motives mentioned, and such like.</P>
<P>Surely they ought to <HI>sit down and count the Cost</HI> in the first Place:—It would be extream Folly to do otherwise, and if they do that well, they would by no Means venture on the Work, without a real and spiritual Sense of the Mo∣tives engaging to Faithfulness therein; for without that, they might justly expect to faint and fail under the Difficulties of the Work, which are such, as would be too hard for a <HI>Gabriel,</HI> unassisted to grapple with. What Presumption, what Madness is it then, for any one to undertake this Work in his own Strength, which is <HI>Weakness itself,</HI> and will be as <HI>nothing,</HI> when set against the united Temptations of the <HI>World,</HI> the <HI>Flesh</HI> and the <HI>Devil?</HI> How is the poor Soul made an easy Prey, being without God, and without his Grace and Strength secured? and what is like to become then of the miserable Souls he undertakes the Care of?</P>
<P>How awful is it for a Person to promise before <HI>God, Angels and Men,</HI> to be faithful in a Work, which is properly spiri∣tual; and which at the same Time he, being <HI>unconverted,</HI> hates, because it is <HI>spiritual,</HI> from the Bottom of his Heart; <HI>for the carnal Mind is Enmity against God</HI> <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 7.</NOTE> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><P>What greater Solecism than a <HI>Man of God</HI> without true <HI>Godliness,</HI> a <HI>Christian Minister,</HI> that is not a <HI>true and real Christian;</HI> and such none can be without real Regeneration, and true Sanctification wrought in him <HI>by the Renewings of the Holy Ghost;</HI> which therefore every one that desires to enter into the Holy Of∣fice of the Gospel Ministry, or does officiate therein, ought most seriously to enquire into his Experience of; and not forget, that it is required of a Minister of Christ, that he be <HI>blameless, sober, just, holy, temperate, and that he exercise him∣self unto Godliness.</HI> Holiness then (even that Holiness <HI>without which no Man shall see the Lord</HI>) belongs to the Scripture Character of a Steward of God; and this all unsanctified, unholy Ministers ought to think of with Trembling.

<P>I shall conclude this Head with the mention of what I have seen in a Letter indited by the excellent Mr. <HI>David Brainerd</HI> when on his Death-Bed, and in the near Views of Eternity, he there signifies, that it appeared <HI>exceeding clear</HI> to his Mind, as well as lay with <HI>great Weight</HI> upon it, that there ought to be <HI>great Satisfaction</HI> of the <HI>true Piety</HI> of those we introduce into the sacred Work; for, says he, "If godly Ministers are left to be <HI>lax</HI> upon this Head, the Number of <HI>ungodly</HI> ones will the faster increase, and these will more readily <HI>strain</HI> a Point, as to the Principles and Practices of those they admit into the Ministry; and thus the Land may gradually be over-run, not only with the unconverted, but even with heterodox, loose and vicious Ministers; which <HI>dreadful Evil</HI> may the Lord, of his infinite Mercy in Jesus Christ, make us wise and faithful, through his Grace, sea∣sonably to prevent."</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="28" REF="007643_0027_102D982103C583E0"/>2. We learn that Ministers of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> should be <HI>fre∣quently and intensely</HI> fix'd in <HI>Meditation</HI> on these and such like Motives, which are truly weighty, and suited to pro∣mote Faithfulness in their Work; and withal be often <HI>wrest∣ling</HI> with Jehovah in the Name of Christ for a deep and stea∣dy Sense of them, that we may thus delight in the sacred Work, even when Success is denied, and look upon it still a great Favour and Honor to be allow'd and enabled to speak and act for God in Christ as his Ambassadors; and that we may, if Success be granted, receive it as an <HI>ad∣ditional</HI> Comfort, and give God the Glory, to whom only it belongs. <HI>Therefore seeing we have this Ministry, as we have received Mercy, we faint not.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Hence the great Propriety and useful Tendency of the Mi∣nisters of the everlasting Gospel, especially in their <HI>Presbyterial</HI> and <HI>Synodical</HI> Conventions, their putting each other, in their Turns, in Mind of those great Truths, which tend to establish, comfort and animate them in the great and difficult Work, and through the divine Blessing will have that Effect, and keep them from fainting; especially since Christ is the <HI>great and only</HI> Head and King of his Church, and we all his Ministers are <HI>Fellow-labourers</HI> <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Eph.</HI> i. 22. <HI>Philem.</HI> 24th Verse.</NOTE>: It cannot then be justly deem'd ar∣rogant, when the meanest and unworthiest of the Ministers of the Gospel, use a plain and pathetic Freedom, as at this Time, with others convened, how much soever superior in Age or Learning, Gifts or Grace; yet with <HI>becoming Respect.</HI></P>

<P>And here I would</P>
<P N="1">1. With all Humility address myself to my <HI>Reverend Fathers</HI> and dear <HI>Brethren</HI> in the Gospel-Ministry conven'd,
<PB N="29" REF="007643_0028_102D98233A0CFA28"/>
whom I reverence, esteem and love, and whom in general I'm persuaded (and rejoice from my <HI>inmost</HI> Soul on the Ac∣count) that the God of the Spirits of <HI>all Flesh</HI> has made up∣right before him, and, in a good Measure, faithful to him, and the Souls of Men, in the great and difficult and yet ho∣nourable Work he has call'd them to.</P>
<P>I just mention this, which I can speak wth <HI>great Sincerity, and affectionate and dutiful, but just Regard,</HI> to prevent any Misconstruction of the Freedom of Speech I use in this Dis∣course.</P>
<P>Permit me, <HI>Reverend Sirs,</HI> on this Occasion to congratu∣late you, that you are call'd, not only to know, but also to <HI>preach the unsearchable Riches of Christ.</HI> Well may we say, <HI>What are we, O Lord, or what is our Father's House? that thou hast brought us hitherto; and that to us this Grace should be given;</HI> to us! who <HI>are less than the least of all Mercies;</HI> yea, to us! who are <HI>less than the least of all Saints.</HI> Oh! then, <HI>have</HI> we <HI>this Ministry?</HI> 'tis only because and as we have <HI>received Mercy.</HI> Have we furthermore special Supports and Consolations, Assistances and Successes at Times? Still it is <HI>as we have received Mercy,</HI> and only so; let God then have all the Glory.</P>
<P>Let us <HI>give Thanks</HI> with our whole Souls, <HI>at the Remem∣brance of</HI> the Divine <HI>Holiness,</HI> Power and Grace, display'd at one Time and another, especially about twelve or fifteen Years ago, in a very glorious and wonderful Work of <HI>Convic∣tion</HI> and <HI>Conversion</HI> of Sinners, as well as <HI>Edification</HI> of God's People; which notwithstanding several unhappy and sad <HI>Extravagances,</HI> or <HI>Extreams,</HI> which attended the same, we (as a dear <HI>Brother</HI> in the Ministry expresses it) still <HI>dare</HI> to call a <HI>Work of God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="007643_0029_102D982500087410"/>Alas! <HI>my Brethren,</HI> that we and others have so much abus'd and misimprov'd this unspeakable Mercy, and provok'd the Lord in such a Measure to depart from us!</P>
<P>And how are we call'd to lament, that <HI>Iniquity awfully a∣bounds</HI> in our Land and Nation; Infidelity, and many false and corrupt Principles, multiplied; and gross Immoralities, Profaneness, and Vices of all Sorts, Worldlymindedness and Lukewarmness in religion, Divisions in Church and State, spiritual Sloth and Barrenness, Blindness and Hard∣ness, Ingratitude and Stupidity, under awful Threatnings and Judgments, Presumption and Security, Pride, Self-righteousness, Unbelief, and Opposition to the late glorious Work of God; and, in a Word, awful Disregard, and even Contempt of God and his Laws, of Christ and his Gospel, and Person, and Grace; of their own Souls and their Fa∣milies and others best and eternal Interests: And how are we further called to lament that <HI>the Love of many waxes cold?</HI> What a general Coldness and Deadness, as to religion, has for some Years prevail'd; nor can we deny, that the Mini∣stry has been infected herewith; though, blessed be God, we have some <HI>Revivings in our Bondage,</HI> both as to divine Comforts and Success, and <HI>should not despise the Day of small Things</HI> <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><HI>Zech.</HI> iv. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Under the <HI>Judgments</HI> we feel or fear, let us be humbled, but not discouraged.</P>
<P>Come, my beloved <HI>Brethren,</HI> let us arise, through Grace, and shake ourselves; let us, for God's Sake, for Christ's Sake, and for precious Soul's Sake, arise, and shake off remains of Sloth and Backwardness on the one

Hand, and sinking Discouragements on the other: Let us, in the Lord's Strength, <HI>quit ourselves like Men,</HI> yea, like <HI>Men of God,</HI> in this dark, degenerate and difficult Day. Oh! what Honor would this reflect on God and religion!</P>
<P>Let us <HI>walk with God,</HI> as <HI>Enoch</HI> did <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> v. 22.</NOTE>: Let us be va∣liant, and yet discreet, active and diligent; <HI>stedfast, and un∣movable, fervent in Spirit, and full of the Holy Ghost; always abounding in the Work of the Lord; knowing that our Labour is not in vain in the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xv. 58.</NOTE>. If we are faithful, and Souls be not gathered, yet we shall be <HI>glorious in the Lyes of the Lord;</HI>—if they be, then we shall say e'er long, <HI>Lord, here we are, and the Children thou hast</HI> graciously <HI>given</HI> us; and shall rejoice with them in Glory for ever.</P>
<P>Oh! my <HI>Fathers,</HI> my <HI>Brethren,</HI> the <HI>Eyes</HI> of Christ, who <HI>will judge the Quick and the Dead at his Appearing, and his Kingdom,</HI> his <HI>Eyes,</HI> I say, which <HI>are as a Flame of Fire</HI> <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> i. 14.</NOTE> are upon us continually in all Parts of our Work and Conduct, with reference to the final Judgment, and that strict Account we must give at his Bar: And if any of us should then meet with the Doom of the <HI>Slothful Servant,</HI> how dreadful! how intolerable!—The very Thought is big with Horror! and Words fail!—</P>
<P>But on the other Hand, how <HI>glorious,</HI> inconceivably <HI>glorious,</HI> is the <HI>Reward</HI> we shall have, if we are faithful, through Grace: Oh! how shall we exult with <HI>extatic</HI> Joy, when our Lord says to us, <HI>Well done good and faithful Ser∣vants, enter into the Joy,</HI> the eternal Joy, <HI>of your Lord.</HI></P>
<P>With this Prospect, shall we not most willingly <HI>spend and be spent</HI> in our Work for Christ, and for Souls? especially considering what Christ Jesus our Lord has done and suffer∣ed
<PB N="32" REF="007643_0031_102D9829CDF1D6E8"/>
for us; and how he has groaned and sweat, bled and died for us on the Cross, that we might live and reign with him in Glory.</P>
<P>Let us further realize the <HI>infinite Glory, Purity and Ex∣cellency of Christ, behold him altogether lovely,</HI> and think no∣thing too much to do or suffer for him, but all vastly too little. Had we a Thousand Lives, and he call'd for them. should we not, with the greatest Freedom and Alacrity, lay them all down, as one speaks fast, as the successive Mi∣nutes roll.—But I must hasten.—<HI>Christ's Dying Love</HI> to his Church, as well as to us, should engage us in our great and difficult, yet honorable, profitable and pleasant Work.</P>
<P>Again, the <HI>People of God are helping us by their Prayers,</HI> and holding up our Arms, while we are <HI>doing the Lord's Work,</HI> and <HI>fighting the Lord's Battles;</HI> and though evil Men <HI>watch for our halting,</HI> this should but make us watch and pray the more, and work the harder, and stand more sure, not in our own, but the Lord's Strength.</P>
<P>Furthermore, <HI>Faithfulness</HI> in our Work, will <HI>express Gratitude</HI> to the blessed Jesus, for calling us to the Know∣ledge of himself, and for putting us into the Ministry, both which are <HI>very great Mercies: Therefore seeing we have this Ministry, as we have received Mercy, let us not faint;</HI> especi∣ally since our Time is short and Death comes hastening on<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">shall I squander away what is <HI>unutterably important,</HI> while it lasts, and when once departed, is <HI>altogether irrevocable?</HI> O! my Soul, forbear the Folly: For∣bear the desperate Extravagance. Wilt thou chide as a <HI>Loiterer,</HI> the Arrow that <HI>boundeth</HI> from the String: or sweep away <HI>Diamonds,</HI> as the <HI>Refuse</HI> of the House? —Throw Time away! Astonishing, ruinous, irreparable Profuseness! Throw Empires away and be blameless. But O! be parsimonious of thy Days: husband thy precious Hours. <HI>Hervey's</HI> Contemplations.</NOTE>.
<PB N="33" REF="007643_0032_102D982C064E1320"/>
Alas! that so much of our Time is run to Waste, and we have done no more for God: Oh! then, let us seize the <HI>flying Moments,</HI> and employ them all for God, and Christ, and Souls.</P>
<P>Some of our Number within a few Years past are called home from their <HI>Work</HI> to their <HI>Reward,</HI> from light and <HI>momentary Trials,</HI> to a <HI>far more exceeding, and eternal Weight of Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! that <HI>a double Portion of the Spirit</HI> may fall on us who survive, that we may <HI>redeem</HI> our <HI>Time</HI> in the best Manner, and double our Diligence!</P>
<P>Many Opportunities we have to express our Love to Christ and Souls in this Life, that we shall never have afterwards: Oh! that we may improve them all, through Grace, to the best Purpose!</P>
<P>Hold out <HI>Faith and Patience,</HI> hold out <HI>Zeal, Activity and Courage,</HI> a little longer, and we shall, <HI>Reverend and dear Sirs,</HI> be with our triumphant Brethren above, and perfectly enjoy, glorify and praise our God and Saviour for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="2">2. I would speak a Word to those of the Children of God who are not in the Ministry. <HI>Brethren! Pray for us!</HI> <NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Thes.</HI> v. 25.</NOTE>. Many Difficulties we meet with in our Work; Oh! pray, that we may not faint or flag; but may find the Grace of our God abundantly sufficient, that we may be successful, if it be the Lord's Will; but, especially, that we may <HI>be faithful to the Death, and then receive a Crown of Life.</HI></P>
<P>I may say to you as I have heard it was said by those who were going to take <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> when they parted with their Friends upon the Shore, <Q>Do you <HI>pray</HI> for us, and we will <HI>fight</HI> for you:</Q> Yea, I may say farther, Do you <HI>pray</HI> for us,
<PB N="34" REF="007643_0033_102D982E300F5840"/>
and we will <HI>work</HI> for you, and <HI>pray</HI> for you too, through Grace, that you may <HI>grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,</HI> that you may <HI>live by Faith</HI> on him, continually <HI>bring forth much Fruit,</HI> adorn your Profession, and ripen apace for Glory; and Oh! <HI>Give the Lord no Rest, till he make Jerusalem a Praise and Joy in the Earth.</HI> And, <HI>dear Brethren,</HI> pray often, and pray ear∣nestly, for <HI>poor, Christless, perishing</HI> Souls.</P>
<P>I would now,</P>
<P N="3">3. Conclude with an Address to <HI>such.</HI></P>
<P>No small Part of our Work, <HI>my dear Hearers,</HI> who are yet in the dismal State of <HI>Unregeneracy</HI> relates to you; and many Difficulties, Services and Fatigues we are willing to go through without fainting, out of Love to, and Concern for your precious Souls, if by any Means we may win you over to the Knowledge and Love of God and Christ, and, at least, <HI>save some.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! consent to be happy, and to live for ever, and don't <HI>kill</HI> yourselves; don't <HI>throw</HI> yourselves Body and Soul into Hell: This you <HI>will</HI> do, if you continue in <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Unbe∣lief.</HI></P>
<P>We come in God's Name to you, and <HI>pray you in Christ's Stead to be reconciled to God:</HI>—We preach the <HI>Terrors</HI> of the Law, as Means suited to awaken and convince you of your sinful, awful State, and absolute <HI>Need</HI> of a <HI>Saviour;</HI> and we set before you the <HI>Invitations</HI> of the Gospel, and the Grace, Beauties and Glories of <HI>Immanuel;</HI> with Desires, that you may, by the Almighty Power and Grace of God, be made willing to receive Christ Jesus, just as he is offered in the Gospel, and rest upon him alone for Salvation: Then, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> you will be inconceivably happy and blessed for ever.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="007643_0034_102D983065532148"/>But Oh! if you continue to neglect and refuse Christ you must perish. <HI>The faithful and true Witness</HI> has declared plainly with his own Mouth, <HI>He that believeth not, shall be damned</HI> <NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mark</HI> xvi. 16.</NOTE>. If you will go to Hell, after all, from under the glorious Advantages of the Gospel, how aggravated must your Damnation be <NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xi. 21, 22, 23, 24.</NOTE>? Oh! can you bear to lie under the <HI>dreadful</HI> Wrath of the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>terrible</HI> God in the Flames of Hell, without one <HI>Drop</HI> of Water to <HI>cool</HI> your <HI>scorched</HI> Tongues; where the <HI>Worm</HI> of Conscience <HI>never dies, and the Fire is not quenched;</HI> and where you must lie roar∣ing, <HI>wailing and gnashing your Teeth,</HI> for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Oh! then <HI>rest not</HI> in your present Condition; and, tho' you must take all <HI>possible Pains</HI> in religion, <HI>read, hear, pray, meditate,</HI> and, in a Word, <HI>strive</HI> with all Earnestness, yet don't rest upon that, or think that God is <HI>obliged</HI> hereupon to save you; but acknowledge he might most <HI>justly</HI> after all this, cast you into Hell:—Come therefore as <HI>poor, guilty, empty, vile, sinful, perishing, ill-deserving, and Hell-deserving</HI> Creature to a <HI>full, glorious and all-sufficient</HI> Christ, who is most <HI>ready</HI> and <HI>willing</HI> to save. <HI>If any Man thirst, let him come</HI> to Christ <HI>and drink.</HI> Oh! come, <HI>poor Souls,</HI> here are <HI>many</HI> of us <HI>Ambassadors</HI> of Jesus Christ together; I trust we join most <HI>cordially</HI> and <HI>affectionately</HI> in <HI>warning you to flee from the Wrath to come,</HI> and in calling and inviting you to Christ.
