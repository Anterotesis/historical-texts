<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Psalm 137.8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>O Daughter of <HI>Babylon,</HI> who art to be destroyed, hap∣py shall he be that rewardeth thee, as thou hast served us.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Penman of this Psalm is uncertain, but the Occa∣sion was doubtless the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Captivity, in the Time of which, or soon after, it seems to have been com∣pos'd.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>Israel</HI> in their melancholy Exile by the Rivers of <HI>Babylon, Euphrates</HI> and <HI>Tygris,</HI> lamented the Loss of their religious Solemnities; <HI>We wept,</HI> said they, <HI>when we remembred Zion;</HI> there they endured the Insults of their Enemies, in demand∣ing Mirth and a Song, of such who were almost overwhelmed with Sorrow and Sadness! but this unseasonable Demand they just∣ly refused to comply with, lest they should seem to forget the Mi∣series of their Church and Nation, whose Prosperity they preferred to all the other Delights of Life: <HI>If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my Right Hand forget her Cunning: If I do not remember thee, let my Tongue cleave to the Roof of my Mouth, if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief Joy!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007799_0004_102D8CE34AD88510"/>While they reflect upon the Cruelty of the Children of <HI>Edom,</HI> their inveterate Enemies, who in the Day of <HI>Jerusalem</HI>'s Calamity, ur∣ged the <HI>Babylonians</HI> to raze it to the Foundation, or to ruin it en∣tirely: They are hereby excited, not from a Principle of private Revenge, but from a generous Regard to God's Glory and King∣dom, to pray to Jehovah to punish them: <HI>Remember, O Lord, the Children of Edom:</HI> From the same pious Principle they are pleased with the Prospect of the utter Overthrow of their Consederates the <HI>Baby∣lonians; O Daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed;</HI> and pro∣nounce a Blessing upon such, who should be Instruments of inflict∣ing this just and righteous Judgment of God upon the Enemies of his Church and People. <HI>Happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us;</HI> i. e. It will be to his great Honour and Advantage, who by executing Justice and equal Severity upon the unrighteous E∣nemies of God's Heritage, is hereby an Instrument in the Hand of God to vindicate his Honour, execute his Judgments, fulfil his Word, and relieve his People: Thus it was with <HI>Cyrus,</HI> as both sacred and prophane History witness, and hence he is call'd God's <HI>Servant,</HI> his <HI>Shepherd,</HI> his <HI>Anointed (Is.</HI> 44. <HI>ult.</HI> 45. 1. <HI>Is.</HI> 13.3.) and the <HI>Soldiers</HI> which were employ'd in recompensing upon the aforesaid Enemies of <HI>Israel,</HI> the Deeds which they did to them, are called his <HI>sanctified Ones. (Is.</HI> 13.3.) From the Words of our Text thus explained, I would observe the following Proposition, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That such, who in the Course of a lawful War, recompence upon the E∣nemies of God's Church and People the Injuries they have done to them, are happy Persons!</HI></P>
<P>In Discoursing upon this Proposition, let us,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>Enquire what Kind of War is Lawful? And,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>Whence its Lawfulness appears? And,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>What are the Injuries our Pagan and Papal Enemies have done to us of late in this Province? And,</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>Wherein consists the Happiness of recompensing them?</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I return to consider the</P>
<P N="1">1st propos'd, which was, to <HI>Enquire what Kind of War is law∣ful?</HI> In answer to which it may be observed, that there are two
<PB N="5" REF="007799_0005_102D8CE4D9B0C070"/>
Kinds of War, <HI>viz. Offensive</HI> and <HI>Defensive:</HI> The former is an unjust Invasion of another's Property, from Principles of Ambition and Ava∣rice; the Latter, is an Attempt to preserve or recover our own from the Hands of Violence, or to punish some publick Injury, which affects the Credit or Interest of a Nation or People; this Kind of War, <HI>viz. Defensive,</HI> when entered into by the supreme Magistrate with due Caution, after pacific Measures have been try'd in vain, and is, in the Mean Time, suitably conducted, can∣not but be lawful and right, seeing it has Justice and Right for its Foundation and Scope, and is the Support, the Execution and De∣fence thereof; but <HI>Offensive</HI> War, being an unjust Invasion of an∣other's Property, is not only different from, but contrary to this, and therefore sinful and unjustifiable; a clear View of the Contra∣riety of these Kinds of War, is of great Importance in this Con∣troversy, and casts a Light upon the whole Argument. I proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">2d propos'd, which was to shew, <HI>whence Defensive War appears to be lawful or right.</HI> Now this, I think, appears evidently from the Suffrage both of <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Revolution.</HI></P>
<P>There is nothing that <HI>Reason</HI> teaches with greater Clearness, or inculcates with a stronger <HI>Pathes,</HI> than the Excellency and Neces∣sity of <HI>commutative Justice,</HI> or giving to every one his own: Now seeing the Design, Nature and Tendency of Defensive War, is to maintain and distribute this among Mankind, it must therefore of Consequence be good in itself, when under proper Regulations, so long as there is any intrinsick Excellency in that Virtue on which it is founded, to which it is directed, and of which it is an Executor: He that opposes this, must either say, that <HI>Justice</HI> itself, in its own Nature, is bad, or that it is wrong to do or promote what is good; each of which is equally absurd, and contrary to the Reason and Common Sense of Mankind, as well as eversive of all Virtue and Religion; those therefore that oppose Defensive War, will never be able fairly to carry their Point, till they so∣lidly prove, that <HI>Justice</HI> itself is sinful and wicked, which, if I am not much mistaken, is a difficult Task.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="007799_0006_102D8CE72A378690"/>I might here observe, that seeing Offensive and Defensive War are Contraries, it therefore follows, That all the Arguments ad∣vanced by any against Offensive War, do turn virtually and con∣sequentially in Favour of Defensive, and are so many Proofs of its Excellency and Necessity. <HI>E. G.</HI> He that opposes the Evil of Injustice, does at the same Time tacitly recommend its Contrary, whether he will or not, for Contraries can neither be oppos'd or defended together with Reason and Propriety; the more abomina∣ble and dangerous the one is, the more excellent is the other, which is oppos'd to it. So that all the Opponents of War, com∣plexly consider'd, are of Necessity Patrons of one Kind of it, tho', perhaps, without their Knowledge, or against their Wills: Now seeing Deceit lurks in Genarals, it is but right that the Opposers of War, should candidly tell us which Kind they are against, to pre∣vent farther Disputes about the Matter: As for our Part, we declare expresly our Abhorrence of <HI>Offensive War,</HI> as a great <HI>Iniquity,</HI> and are willing to make this evident, not only by <HI>Words,</HI> but by <HI>Actions,</HI> in labouring by main Force to destroy that <HI>Monster,</HI> if milder Measures will not answer the noble End, of introducing the desirable Blessing of Peace.</P>
<P>Charity would incline me to think, that the Opposers of War, must mean Offensive; for surely they wou'dn't knowingly express so much Zeal and Invective as is sometimes used in this Argument against <HI>Justice:</HI> Well, if the Case be so, we have them upon our Side of the Question; they are, in Effect, warm Advocates for Defensive War, and this indeed is no small Comfort, that our Op∣ponents are so friendly in this Debate, we with they would either understand us or themselves, and join with us in proving by <HI>Fact,</HI> the Reality of their Hatred against that Abomination that maketh desolate, <HI>Offensive War:</HI> Their Invectives against it are just and commendable, but insufficient to destroy it; Words won't kill that <HI>Hydra;</HI> herein therefore they fail, that they don't join with us Heart and Hand, by Force and Arms to crush that cruel <HI>Cocka∣trice!</HI> May it not be hoped that in Time-coming they will better bethink themselves, and act a more consistent Part; that they will
<PB N="7" REF="007799_0007_102D8CE9C99F0340"/>
not serve so good a Cause as press'd Men by Constraint, but nobly and openly join as VOLUNTEERS!</P>
<P>But in Addition to the Maxim of Justice now mentioned, the Light of Nature teaches every one to preserve his Life from unjust Violence, by the Principle of <HI>Self-Love,</HI> which is implanted in all, and which, when kept within due Bounds, is good and necessary, and therefore made by our Lord the Standard of Love to our Neighbour; this Principle disposes us to desire Life, as well as to fear and shun the Approaches of Death; when we therefore neglect a necessary and seasonable Self-defence, we are without <HI>natural Affection, Self-haters;</HI> a rare and strange Sort of Monsters in Na∣ture; for <HI>no Man ever hated his own Flesh, but nourisheth and cherish∣eth it.</HI></P>
<P>Reason likewise teaches the Propriety and Necessity of Self-defence, from the <HI>Capacity</HI> given to this Purpose, and <HI>Inclination</HI> to exercise it; Man is endowed with Understanding and Ability, which the innocent Resentment common to all, urges to exert in opposing Violence, and guarding against the Approaches of Dan∣ger: And therefore he that suffers his Life to be taken from him, by one that hath no Authority for that Purpose, when he might preserve it by Defence, betrays it, and consequently is guilty of <HI>Self-Murder,</HI> one of the greatest of Crimes!</P>
<P>Considering the present State of human Nature, to banish Self-defence, though prosecuted by Force, would be so far from pro∣moting Peace, that it would on the Contrary contribute to the ut∣ter <HI>Destruction</HI> of Mankind! For Injustice in this Situation of Things, having no Fear of Punishment to check its Course, would inundate the World, and introduce universal <HI>Anarchy,</HI> Confusion and <HI>Ruin:</HI> a melancholy Confirmation of which we have lately had in the defenceless Frontiers of this secure, unhappy Province!</P>
<P><HI>Sirs,</HI> If it be not lawful and right, to oppose with Force unjust Invaders, then the Goods of Providence are given to no valuable Purpose, and the best of Men are exposed as an easy <HI>Prey</HI> to the Worst, and that by <HI>God</HI>'s own <HI>Order,</HI> which is absurd! Is it ra∣tional to suppose, that the Law of Nature, which was designed to pro∣mote
<PB N="8" REF="007799_0008_102D880EB6ED89E8"/>
Man's Safety in this World, should countenance such a sorry Sort of Peace, as tends to promote the very Contrary? no surely! For this would, in Effect, charge Weakness and Folly upon God himself, which to impute to infinite and unerring Wisdom, is a blasphemous Reflection!</P>
<P>Farther, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> give me leave to add, that <HI>Reason</HI> like∣wise teaches the Necessity of the <HI>Magistrates Office</HI> in a Communi∣ty, to punish Injustice, and to protect our Persons and Properties; now how can these be done without Force and Arms, in such a degenerate World as this is? And if either of these be neglected, what is <HI>Government</HI> but an empty Name, a meer <HI>Cypher,</HI> that, instead of Honour, deserves <HI>Contempt!</HI> Such a sorry Government is much worse than none a at all; worse than a State of Nature, be∣cause it binds Mens Hands till they are <HI>robb'd</HI> and <HI>murder'd,</HI> which, otherwise, they might use in their own Defence!</P>
<P>Nothing admits of clearer Demonstration, than that Force and Fighting are essential to the Being and Preservation of Civil Go∣vernment, in Man's present corrupt State; now, if the Case be so, it is the very same (in all Things material) with Defensive War, the <HI>Substance</HI> of both is the same, <HI>viz.</HI> Force and Fighting, Bloodshed and Death; the <HI>Authority</HI> enjoining both is the same, <HI>viz.</HI> that of the Magistrate, the <HI>End</HI> of both is the same, <HI>viz.</HI> the Preservation of the State; the <HI>Occasion</HI> the same, <HI>viz.</HI> that easier Methods will not, at Times, answer the aforesaid Ends: Certainly the Number of <HI>Villains</HI> cannot lesson their Crimes, nor have <HI>Rogues</HI> of another Nation any Right to rob and murder us with Impunity more than those of our own: Why then should they not be oppos'd with equal Care and Force?</P>
<P>What is <HI>Civil Government</HI> but the Union of Individuals, for the more effectual Protection of Person and Property from Injus∣tice and Violence? whereby a sufficient Measure of Power is, by common Consent, treasured up for the Security and Benefit of all the Members of that Body, which is to be exerted to compass the aforesaid important Ends, as the publick Officers of the Society shall direct: And hence it is that Persons who are wrong'd, or in Danger of being so, reasonably fly to the Officers of the Communi∣ty
<PB N="9" REF="007799_0009_102D8CEF06FB8D48"/>
for Justice and Protection, which if they are absolutely deny'd, or unreasonably <HI>deferred,</HI> beyond the proper Season for <HI>Succour,</HI> and many Persons are in the mean Time <HI>robb'd</HI> and <HI>murder'd,</HI> the principal End of Government is contradicted and destroyed; and the People wrong'd and robb'd of their Right, as <HI>Members</HI> of <HI>Society;</HI> nor will it be easy to clear such publick <HI>Officers</HI> (or those of them who are accessary to the aforesaid Measures) from the Guilt of <HI>Blood!</HI></P>
<P>Now if <HI>Magistracy</HI> and <HI>Defensive War</HI> be the same in Substance, as has been observed, it is strange that any should be ready to ac∣cept the one, who scruple the other, as if it was a wicked Thing to put a foreign Criminal to Death, but just and good to kill one of our own Country and Nation! Wou'dn't it look more like Candour, Humility and Consistency, for such as scruple <HI>Defensive War,</HI> or deny it, to keep clear of <HI>Offices</HI> in the <HI>Government,</HI> which oblige them, if they will act in Character, to do what is equivalent thereto: Then there would be no Need of <HI>ambiguous, general</HI> and <HI>artful</HI> Terms, possibly to conceal from vulgar Obser∣vance and Prejudice Practices really contradictory to professed Principles; to reconcile such extraordinary Conduct to <HI>common Candour</HI> and <HI>Sincerity,</HI> is a Task so difficult, that it vastly surpasses the Reach of an ordinary Understanding.</P>
<P>I must confess I am utterly at a Loss to conceive the Consistency of Persons who are principled against <HI>Defensive War</HI> accepting of Offices in the Government, the chief Design of which is to defend the Community; it is a Contradiction in Terms as well as Matter, a gross <HI>Absurdity;</HI> and this is the more unaccountable, when it is done in a Time of publick Danger; for hereby, if Mens professed Principles may be supposed to have any Influence upon their Con∣duct, they will be tempted to take wrong Measures, or over-slow∣ly prosecute those that are right; and hereby others are kept from the <HI>Helm</HI> in a Storm, whose Principles would probably lead them to do what is necessary to the Safety of the State.</P>
<P>Nor is it easy to clear those from the Charge of Inconsistency, and something worse, who desire and expect Protection, and per∣haps complain if they have it not, and yet CHUSE into publick Of∣fices
<PB N="10" REF="007799_0010_102D8CF0F72F26C8"/>
those who are principled against it, whether they are not, by the aforesaid <HI>Choice,</HI> in some Degree chargeable with all the un∣happy CONSEQUENCES of such a Government, it is but proper they should soberly enquire?</P>
<P>The Practice of all Nations, not only of the most civilized, but even of the most rude and barbarous, who all with one Con∣sent have oppos'd Force to Force in their own Defence, from the Beginning of the World to this Time, is no inconsiderable Argu∣ment to prove that <HI>Defensive War</HI> is agreeable to the <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Common Sense</HI> of Mankind; the Denial of it is therefore a Contra∣diction to <HI>Reason,</HI> and an Affront to <HI>Common Sense.</HI></P>
<P>Yea the very <HI>Beasts,</HI> by <HI>natural Instinct,</HI> are disposed to defend themselves, and are provided with Weapons for that Purpose; it should therefore be queried, in case we make no Resistance when Necessity urges, whether we do not act with less Wisdom than <HI>Pagans,</HI> and with less Discretion than <HI>Beasts?</HI> Now can it be with Reason supposed, that the <HI>Christian Institution,</HI> which was design'd to exalt us above the <HI>Angels,</HI> should, at the same Time, sink us be∣low <HI>Infidels</HI> and <HI>Beasts?</HI></P>
<P>Having offered some what respecting the Suffrage of <HI>Reason</HI> in favour of <HI>Defensive War,</HI> I proceed to enquire wether <HI>Revelation</HI> in the several Periods of the Church of God, or Dispensati∣ons of Heaven towards it, does not coroborate and confirm the aforesaid <HI>Suffrage?</HI> Here a large Field opens, but the Time allows me to mention only a few Hints.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Patriarchal Age,</HI> I would only offer one Instance, <HI>viz.</HI> That of <HI>Abraham,</HI> the <HI>Friend of God,</HI> and <HI>Father of the Faithful,</HI> he trained up his Servants, instructed them in the Use of Arms, to prepare them for Action, when Necessity required; and therefore when he heard that his Brother was taken captive, he arm'd his train'd Servants, smote the Enemy, and pursued them. It would have been happy for this poor Province, if such in it who profess themselves to be the spiritual <HI>Children of Abraham,</HI> had followed the Example of the <HI>Father of the Fruthful,</HI> in hastening to the Relief of their distressed Protestant Brethern, it would have shown some <HI>Brotherly Love,</HI> prevented much Bloodshed, and given some Evi∣dence
<PB N="11" REF="007799_0011_102D8CF2E7E43C08"/>
of their <HI>spiritual Claim.</HI> Now that the Almighty approved of this memorable Battle of <HI>Abraham,</HI> is evident from <HI>Melchizedek's</HI> congratulating him on Occasion of his Victory, and likewise by his blessing him, and blessing God on the same Account, and by his receiving Part of the Spoils, all which would have been absurd and impious, if the Battle itself hadn't been lawful. See <HI>Gen.</HI> 14 (18, 19, 20. Verses.) <HI>And Melchizedek King of Salem, Priest of the Most high God, blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abraham of the Most High God, Possessor of Heaven and Earth, and Blessed be the Most High God, which hath delivered thine Enemies into thine Hands.</HI> Here ob∣serve, that seeing this Battle of <HI>Abraham</HI> was fought before the <HI>Jewish</HI> Policy and Ceremonies were form'd, was likewise an im∣portant Action, that concern'd the Goods and Lives of Men, and met with the Divine Approbation, <HI>Defensive War</HI> must there∣fore be morally and unalterably good and lawful.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Mosaick Dispensation,</HI> or <HI>Jewish Oeconomy,</HI> nothing is more evident, than that divers <HI>Wars,</HI> were carry'd on while that subsisted, by various Worthies, with the divine Approbation and Direction; thus devout <HI>Gideon,</HI> a mighty Man of Valour, was commissioned to fight against the <HI>Midianites,</HI> and rescue <HI>Israel</HI> from their Tyranny▪ (<HI>Judges</HI> 6 14 16.) <HI>And the Lord said, Go in this thy Might, and thou shall save Israel from the Hand of the Midianites, have I not sent thee! surely I will be with thee, and thou shalt slay the Midi∣anites as one Man.</HI></P>
<P>Pious <HI>Joshua</HI> was also rais'd up of God, to conduct <HI>Israel</HI> in their Wars, for which he had the divine Prescription. (<HI>Josh.</HI> 8. 1, 2.) <HI>And the Lord said unto Joshua, take all the People of War with thee and arise go up to Ai, and thou shall do unto Ai and her King, as thou didst to Jericho and her King.</HI></P>
<P>Farther <HI>David,</HI> the <HI>Man after God's own Heart,</HI> was another In∣stance of the like Kind, who praises the Almighty that he had <HI>taught his Hands to war, and his Fingers to fight:</HI> He conducted his Battles according to the express Order of God. (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 30.8.) Well seeing <HI>Defensive War</HI> was enjoin'd by divine Authority under any Dispensation, at any past Period of Time, it follows necessari∣ly, either that it is in itself innocent, or that God is the Author of
<PB N="12" REF="007799_0012_102D88158BA487A0"/>
Sin, by enjoining what is in itself sinful: But the latter is blasphe∣mous, and therefore the Former is most certainly true; <HI>viz. That Defensive War is in itself innocent and good,</HI> and, if so, becomes a Duty, when Providence calls to it by the Necessity of Affairs, and the Magistrates Order: Why therefore should an innocent Thing be dress'd up in Bears-skins and a <HI>Huc-and-Cry</HI> rais'd against it? Is this fair or reasonable?</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Christian</HI> or <HI>New Testament Dispensation,</HI> there are divers Instances which sufficiently confirm the Point in View. E. G. When the Soldiers ask'd <HI>John the Baptist, what they should do?</HI> he did not direct them to lay aside their <HI>military Employment,</HI> but to <HI>be content with their Wages:</HI> Which supposes his Approbation, of the Business they were engaged in, and implies an Encouragement to continue in it; it cannot be with Reason imagined, that this inspi∣red Person, would give Instruction how to conduct an Employ∣ment obsolutely sinful; for that would be to give Direction how to commit Iniquity, which is absurd! No, if he had judged that Manner of Life to be sinful, he would have said so; for indeed he had not only an Opportunity, but a proper Call to this Pur∣pose, in Answer to the Question proposed to him; nor was he ever known to mince the Matter.</P>
<P>Farther, These Words of our Lord, recorded <HI>John</HI> 18.36. do expresly declare his Approbation of <HI>Defensive War; If my Kingdom were of this World, then would my Servants fight, that I should not be deli∣vered to the Jews.</HI> Here the Redeemer signifies that temporal Kingdoms should be protected by <HI>Fighting</HI> or by <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Force.</HI></P>
<P>Of the like Tendency is the following Declaration of Christ ex∣pressed by the Evangelist <HI>Matthew,</HI> Chap. 24, and 43d Verse, <HI>But know this, that if the good Man of the House had known in what Watch the Thief would come, he would have watched, and not suffered his House to be broken up.</HI></P>
<P>This our Lord speaks of with Approbation, and therefore here∣by teaches the Lawfulness and Necessity of opposing Robbers by Force, and of preparing for this Opposition: <HI>The good Man would have watched, and would not have suffered.</HI> Well, if we should resist one Robber, much more many, because the Danger is greater;
<PB N="13" REF="007799_0013_102D8CF6F4513BF8"/>
and if we should resist Robbers, when they only attempt to take away our Goods, much more when they attack our Lives, which are of more Importance.</P>
<P>Another memorable Passage of our Saviour to the same Purpose, is that directed to the Apostle <HI>Peter, Mat.</HI> 26.53, 54. <HI>Thinkest thou that I cannot pray to my Father, and he shall presently give me more than</HI> 12 <HI>Legions of Angels; but how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus it must be.</HI> The Meaning of which is plainly this, that Christ must die for the Sins of his People according to the Scriptures, and therefore the Use of Force to protect his Life in this extraordinary Situation, was unnecessary and inconsistent; but that if the Case had been otherwise, he would have us'd a military Force for his Protection against unjust Violence. Our Lord speaks of the <HI>An∣gels</HI> as <HI>military Troops,</HI> and signifies that on Supposition his Case was ordinary, and he attack'd by the Hand of Violence, he would use Means to obtain an <HI>arm'd Force</HI> for his Protection; and did not the great Doctor of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> who well knew the Mind of his Master and Lord, actually do this, when a Conspiracy was form'd by the <HI>Jews</HI> against his Life: (See <HI>Acts</HI> the 23d Chap.) I hope then there is no Harm in following our Lord and his chief Apostle.</P>
<P>Here it may be farther observed, respecting the last Instance, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> before he apply'd for a Military Force to pro∣tect him, had the possitive Promise of God that he shou'd preach the Gospel of Christ at <HI>Rome,</HI> and consequently be protected from the present Combination against his Life (<HI>Acts</HI> 23.11.) in which Promise he doubtless trusted, yet notwithstanding he tho't it neces∣sary to use the proper outward Mean for his Defence, <HI>viz.</HI> an arm'd Force; this plainly shews the Consistency thereof with the Pro∣mise of God, and a Dependance on him.</P>
<P>Nor should these Words of our Saviour be overlook'd, <HI>are ye come out against me as against a Thief with Swords and with Staffs;</HI> here the blessed Jesus signifies his Approbation of the Use of <HI>Arms</HI> and <HI>Force</HI> against a <HI>Thief</HI> to bring him to Justice, well if in the Judg∣ment of Christ, this be lawful and necessary against one; it is
<PB N="14" REF="007799_0014_102D8CF9225F7FE0"/>

<P>When the <HI>Centurion</HI> or <HI>Roman Captain</HI> address'd our Saviour on Account of his sick Servant, and us'd his Military Office as an Argument to obtain his Request, our Lord granted the Petition infere'd by that Argument, and commended the Faith encourag'd by it: which considering the Call the Redeemer then had to de∣clare his Mind in Relation to <HI>Defensive War</HI> fairly imply his A∣probation of it.</P>
<P>If <HI>Defensive War</HI> be sinful, then to what purpose or with what consistency did our Lord command every one of his Disciples, that had <HI>no Sword, to sell his Garment and buy one, (Luke</HI> 22.39.) and why is <HI>Cornelius</HI> Captain of the <HI>Italian</HI> Company so highly honour'd by Heaven and Earth, and adorn'd with the most amiable Charac∣ter, of being <HI>a devout Man, and one that fear'd God with all his House,</HI> which <HI>gave much Alms to the People, and pray'd to God always;</HI> and in the mean Time no <HI>Censure</HI> past upon his military Office by an inspir'd Apostle, sent for by divine Direction, to inform him of his Duty, and that under the express <HI>Promise</HI> of an <HI>Angel,</HI> that said Apostle shou'd tell him what he ought to do▪ from this In∣stance therefore, one of two Things necessarily follows, either that the Angel's Promise fail'd, or that <HI>Cornelius</HI> ought not to desert his military Station, but the former is impossible, and there∣fore the latter is true, and thus the labouring Point is gain'd, <HI>that Defensive War is lawful.</HI></P>
<P>The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in his Epistle to the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> speaks with Honour and Approbation of the Bravery and martial Exploits of divers antient Heroes, who <HI>through Faith subdued Kingdoms, waxed valiant in Fight, and put to Flight the Armies of Aliens</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here observe, that War and Fighting in a good Cause is so far from being contrary to Faith, that they are Fruit of it. Those therefore who instead of bringing forth this Fruit condemn such as do, shou'd enquire how they will prove their Faith to be of the same kind with that of <HI>David, Samuel</HI> and the <HI>Pro∣phets.</HI> Hebrews. 11.32, 33.</NOTE>: And in diverss other Passages of Scripture, God himself who is the best Judge of Truth, Excellency and Worth, speaks with Honour of

military Bravery, and hence the Persons posses'd of it are call'd <HI>mighty Men of Valour,</HI> it is therefore a sorry Sort of Gospel, that con∣tradicts the Judgment of God himself and his inspir'd Servants; that CASHIERS from the Catalogue of Virtues, <HI>Fortitude and military Bravery,</HI> which are so noble in themselves and necessary to the publick <HI>Weal,</HI> and Dubs in their room either sordid Coward∣ice, or stupid Negligence, or rather both together, which are as base in themselves, as pernicious and destructive to Society. Unreasonable and abominable is that pretended Christianity, which directs us to take more Care for the Support of our Bodies, than the Protection of our <HI>Lives,</HI> which our <HI>Lord</HI> tells us are <HI>better than Food and Rayment.</HI> If some have been protected in Dangers miraculously, so others have been fed in like man∣ner, well, seeing the Cases are Parallel, why will not such who expect Protection without the Use of Arms, try whether they can live without Food, a little Trial of this, if we cou'd but persuade them to it, would soon convince them of the Folly of their Faith, or rather Presumption, and be of more Service than many Arguments. But to preced,</P>
<P>Give me leave farther to observe, that the Argument before us'd of the MAGISTRACY in Favour of <HI>Defensive War</HI> from Reason, is con∣firm'd by Revelation, and that not only in the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> but the <HI>New:</HI> The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in his <HI>Epistle to the Romans,</HI> observes, that <HI>the Magistrate is a Minister of God, to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil, and shou'd not bear the Sword in vain,</HI> and elsewhere Go∣vernors are said to be sent for <HI>the Punishment of evil Doors, and Praise of those that do well, that under them we may live peaceable and quiet Lives, in all Godliness and Honesty;</HI> and hence we are told, that <HI>he that sheds Man's Blood, by Man shall his Blood be shed;</HI> we are likewise enjoin'd to <HI>give Tribute to Cesar,</HI> and to <HI>be Subject to the higher Powers,</HI> because <HI>there is no Power but of God:</HI> Well, if Government be a Divine Institution, and <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Fighting</HI> are es∣sential to it, as both Reason and Revelation assure us, then such as oppose <HI>Defensive War,</HI> if they will be consistent with them∣selves, must also oppose all civil Order and Government upon the Earth, which if put in Practice wou'd soon open such a Scene

of Confusion, Desolation and Blood, as wou'd entirely ruin the whole human Race. It is but right, <HI>that all they that take the Sword</HI> (without or against just and lawful Authority) <HI>shou'd perish with the Sword,</HI> Matt. 26.52. and that he that <HI>leadeth into Captivity should go into Captivity. He that killeth with the Sword, must be kill'd with the Sword, here is the Faith and Patience of the Saints,</HI> saith the Scrip∣tures, Rev. 13.16.</P>
<P>Once more, if we must without Opposition, tamely and sordid∣ly suffer all that is dear to us, as Men and Christians, to be made an easy Prey of by our unrighteous and implacable Ene∣mies, then we are in a worse Condition under the Gospel than ever Mankind were in before it; then the last, the brightest and most gracious Dispensation of God towards Men, instead of en∣larging our Priveleges as it professes, has overset them all at one <HI>Stroke,</HI> and left us in a State of the most abject Slavery, and dreadful <HI>Vassalage</HI> to the Lusts of every Invader, which is con∣trary to the Truth of the Scriptures, and to the Wisdom and Good∣ness of God, as well as entirely eversive of all human Happi∣ness in this Life<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">I might here add to the <HI>Suffrage</HI> of Reason and Revelation, that of the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> the primitive Fathers of which declared their Sentinents in Favour of Defensive War, witness <HI>Clement, Clemens Alexandrinus, Irenius, Origen, Tertullian, Minutius Felix, Cyprian, Chrisostom, Nazarius, Basil, Augustine, Am∣brose, Cyril, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory Niss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n,</HI> and others, but not only particular Fathers; but whole Councils have signified various Ways their Approbation of Defensive War; they therefore made it a positive Rule and Constitution among them, that Soldiers of a sober Life, should be admitted to Church Membership their Words are these, <Q>Let a Soldier that desires to be baptized, be exhorted to abstain from Wrongs and Oppressions, and to be content with his Pay; if he complies with these, let him be admitted.</Q> See <HI>Constitu. Clem. Lib.</HI> 8. <HI>Cap.</HI> 32. This is exactly agreeable to <HI>John the Baptist's</HI> Counsel to the Soldiers, and to the inspired Apostle <HI>Peter</HI>'s Practice, who without the least demurr, baptized the worthy Soldier <HI>Cornelius,</HI> thereby receiving him into Church Fellowship; and in the mean Time declared, that none could reasonably deprive such of it; <HI>Can a∣ny Man</HI> (saith he) <HI>forbid Water that these should not be baptized, that have received the Holy Ghost as well as we; and he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord, Acts</HI> 10.47, 48. Any Passages in the Writings of the Antients, of a dif∣ferent Appearance at first View, upon Examination will be found only to signify either their Aversion to the Method of propagating Religion by Force, or of resisting the lawful Government under which they liv'd, or the Unsuitable∣ness of the Clergies bearing Arms, or of Christians engaging in War when idolatrous or other sinful Terms, were impos'd. The Lawfulness of Defen∣sive War under proper Regulations, was not so much as disputed, and far less was the Denyal of it made a Term of Communion by any (of Note) or by any Society of Christians for above 1500 Years after Christ; and therefore the Opinion that every kind of War is in itself a great Evil, and that such as are for the defensive Kind, shou'd be cast out of religious Socie∣ty; is a novel upstart Notion, of very late Date, as contrary to Antiquity as to Scripture and Reason. See this confirm'd and illustrated, in a Treatise entitled, Defensive War defended; Printed here <HI>Anno.</HI> 1748.</NOTE>.</P>

<P N="1">1. It should be carefully observ'd, and constantly kept in View, that <HI>Offensive</HI> and <HI>Defensive War</HI> are Contraries. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. That private Offences, and those which are publick and national, are very different; the First, in Society, we have no Right ourselves to punish, and in lesser Instances should pass by for the Sake of Peace, but the Latter, the Magistrate, as God's Vice∣gerent, is oblig'd to avenge, for the Glory of God, and Safety of the Community. And,</P>
<P N="3">3. That whatsoever is grounded upon the Nature and Reason of things is moral and perpetual. But I proceded to the</P>
<P N="3">3d. GENERAL HEAD of Discourse propos'd, which was to <HI>En∣quire what are the Injuries, which our Pagan and Papal Enemies have done to the Inhabitants of this Province?</HI> this, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> is a melan∣choly Subject, and deserves to be lamented with the tenderest Pas∣sion! you know, <HI>Sirs,</HI> they have carried many of our Brethren into a melancholy Captivity, Captivity big with Danger and Horror, they have laid waste by <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Sword</HI> a considerable Part of the back Settlements of this Province, burnt the Houses, the Barns, the Goods, the Crops of the Inhabitants, and kill'd their Creatures, without which they cannot subsist; by all which,
<PB N="18" REF="007799_0018_102D8D0131809798"/>
no small Part of a once flourishing Country is cover'd with a general <HI>Ruin,</HI> and reduc'd even to a Funeral <HI>Pile!</HI> but what is still worse, they have murder'd, they have murder'd, many Hundreds of innocent Persons, and that with such Circumstances of Inhumanity and Barbarity, as are too shocking to relate; they have spar'd neither Age nor Sex, the pregnant <HI>Mother</HI> and ten∣der <HI>Infant,</HI> as well as the <HI>boary Head,</HI> and sprightly <HI>Youth,</HI> have been alike sacrificed to their causeless and cruel Resent∣ment! and indeed, many who have hitherto surviv'd the <HI>Cata∣strophe,</HI> are reduc'd to the most piteous and deplorable Circum∣stances by the Loss of their dear Relations, and of their worldly Substance; encompass'd with frequent Alarms of the Aproach of a merciless Enemy, and of the Mischiefs they have done in other Places, in hourly Expectation of a violent Death, not knowing what to do, or where to fly for Safety; in this aw∣ful Perplexity, while there Way is shut up, and their <HI>Lives hang in Doubt,</HI> every Moment, they suffer 1000 Deaths before they die. These Injuries our Enemies have done unprovok'd (un∣less by our defenceless and secure State) yea after many impor∣tant Kindnesses, and contrary to the Faith of Treaties; nor is this dismal Scene come to a Period, we still hear of <HI>the Alarm of War, and of Garments roll'd in Blood;</HI> we still hear of fresh In∣cursions, and of <HI>Desolation</HI> upon <HI>Desolation;</HI> alas, for this mise∣rable Province, what will be the End of these Things?</P>
<P>But has this Train of Miseries, this Complication of Calamities, broke in upon us suddenly, without any previous <HI>Notice?</HI> no! we have had repeated Intimations of the destructive Designs of our Enemies, and of their warlike Preparations in the Back Parts of this Continent, but have stupidly slighted repeated Warnings of our approaching Danger and awful Fate; like <HI>Le∣viathan</HI> we have <HI>laughed at the shaking of the Spear,</HI> as tho' we were invulnerable; and hence the Report of Colonel <HI>Washington</HI>'s Defeat was reckon'd by many to be fabulous; and that of Gene∣ral <HI>Braddock</HI> believ'd slowly, yea, even after repeated Expresses had constrain'd a general Credit, and the Enemy had done con∣siderable Damage in <HI>Verginia;</HI> tho' a Number were seiz'd for

a little Time with a <HI>Panick,</HI> yet the Province in general re∣main'd in a State of Indolence and deep <HI>Security,</HI> without any suitable religious Improvement of this awful Providence, without any proper <HI>Preparation</HI> made in due Season to <HI>protect</HI> the back Inhabitants, who where left defenceless, and expos'd as an easy Prey to a bloody Enemy, as <HI>Sheep</HI> for the <HI>Slaughter!</HI> Alas for it! many Self-righteous People among us presumptuosly ex∣pected, that this Province wou'd not share the common Fate of the rest; and hence they boasted for a Time that no Hurt was done by the Enemy in <HI>Pennsylvania,</HI> and therefore, after divers were murdered in it, the News thereof were by many too flowly credited, unreasonbly contradicted, or diminutively repre∣sented, and treated with Slight and Indifference: Yea, after the most pressing Remonstrances of the Distressed for Help and Protection, how little has been done to any <HI>good Purpose</HI> to relieve them? and how <HI>slowly?</HI> how <HI>late?</HI> It is indeed shocking to think of the Infatuation and Security that have prevail'd among us, in a Time of such general, great, and growing Danger and Calamity! Had FORTS been built in the back Parts of the Coun∣try in due Season, the Inhabitants train'd up in the Use of Arms, and form'd into a regular MILITIA, by an equitable and impartial ACT of the LEGISLATURE for that Purpose, an ACT not calculated to serve the Ease and Emolument of a Party, at the Expence of the the Rest, who, as loyal Subjects to the best of Kings have a Right to equal Privileges with others of the same Community; if these Things had been done, and the Warn∣ings we have had credited and improv'd, our present Distresses wou'd probably have been either wholly prevented, or much lessen'd; but <HI>Sirs,</HI> if the Truth may be told, ENTHUSIASTICK PRINCI∣PLES, against <HI>Defensive War,</HI> have been in a great Degree the Cause of our present Miseries, and, if closely and consistently acted up to, are like to be our utter and final <HI>Ruin!</HI> these have prevented necessary, proper and seasonable Preparations for <HI>War</HI> before it came, and either diverted from, or retarded proper Measures for <HI>Defence</HI> when it did come, these have cast Multitudes into a deep Sleep, and prejudiced them against their Duty, and
<PB N="20" REF="007799_0020_102D8D0570F64188"/>
their Interest so that they will neither do any Thing them∣selves to any good Purpose to save a sinking State, nor suffer others to do it with <HI>Impunity.</HI> These have bro't us not long since to the Verge of a <HI>Civil War</HI> among ourselves, one of the most dreadful Calamities that can besal any State or Community! In our singularly awful, and melancholy Situation (especially of late) every Eye not blinded with Prejudice, might see in the strongest Point of Light, the grand Absurdity and Danger of <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> its absolute <HI>Inconsistency</HI> with <HI>Civil Government</HI> and the Safety of any Country; especially when it has the Direction of the <HI>Helm</HI> in the Time of a <HI>Tempest.</HI> It is ridiculous to talk of <HI>Privileges! Privileges!</HI> when we are in Danger of being murdered by the Enemy, for Want of a proper <HI>Defence;</HI> as if it was a Privilege to be <HI>robb'd,</HI> and <HI>scalp'd!</HI> These Things, Gentlemen, I have spoken not from Pre∣judice to any Party or People, but from a Principle of Love to God and my Country, whose Protection and Prosperity I sincerely wish! The</P>
<P N="4">4th <HI>General Head of Discourse,</HI> comes now to be considered, which was <HI>To shew wherein consists the Happiness of Recompensing the Injuries our Enemies have done to us?</HI> Hereby, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> we conform to the commanding, approving <HI>Will</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> hereby we promote his declarative <HI>Glory</HI> among Men, even the Glory of his Justice and Righteousness; hereby we copy after the <HI>Example</HI> of pious and prudent Men in all Ages and Periods of the Church and World; hereby we evidence in Fact the Since∣rity of our <HI>Love</HI> to our Religious and Civil Liberties, as well as to our <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Country,</HI> and manifest the Reality of our Regard to our dear <HI>Relations</HI> and <HI>Friends,</HI> to whom we are bound by the tenderest Ties! hereby we do our ut∣most to preserve inviolate the <HI>Sacred Depositum,</HI> or inexpresibly valuable Trust of our <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Liberty,</HI> and to transmit them <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>uncorrupt</HI> to future and distant Ages; hereby with <HI>manly Bravery,</HI> we, to good Purpose, oppose those Enemies to all that is great and good, <HI>French Tyranny, Romish Idolatry and Superstition;</HI> in a Word, we express the <HI>Courage</HI> of Men, and the <HI>Piety</HI> of

Such, such, will be mention'd with Honour, in the Records of <HI>Time,</HI> the Annals of <HI>Nations;</HI> yea, such <HI>Gene∣rations</HI> unborn <HI>will rise up, and call them blessed;</HI> while the Names of <HI>sordid Cowards, wild Enthusiasts,</HI> and <HI>detestable Gallees,</HI> shall be cover'd with Contempt, and not in the Dust! if any Thing can yield Comfort to a generous Mind, surely these that have been mentioned may especially in a complex View.</P>

to the Help of the Lord against the Mighty;</HI> here observe, that ta∣king up Arms, and actually joining in Battle with God's People, engag'd in a lawful War against their Enemies, is here call'd a <HI>Helping the Lord against the Mighty,</HI> because the Lord requires it, and his Cause is defended by it, and likewise that such who refuse to assist in Arms, or desert their Brethren engag'd in such a Cause, are under the bitter Curse of God! <HI>But blessed above Women shall Jael the Wife of Heber the Kenite be, blessed shall she be above Women in the Tent!</HI> why? because <HI>she smote</HI> and <HI>slew Sisera</HI> the Enemy of God's <HI>Israel;</HI> well, if martial Bravery ex∣alted <HI>Jael</HI> above her Sex, then certainly by the Rule of Con∣traries, Cowardice (in Principle and Practice) degrades Males not only below their own Sex (of whom Courage is expected) but even below Females; such Persons forfeit the Character of <HI>Men,</HI> and are weaker than <HI>Women;</HI> the same God that severely punishes Cowards, and Deserters of his Cause and People in a Day of Danger and Difficulty, will amply reward with Important Blessings and Benefits, brave Soldiers, gallant HEROES and HEROINES! this famous Instance of FEMALE FORTITUDE is a standing Reproach to <HI>Cowards</HI> and <HI>Galleos</HI> of the hardier and robuster Sex, and may justly cover them with confound∣ing <HI>Blushes,</HI> as unworthy of the Name of Men, or of a Place in <HI>ci∣vil Society!</HI> to play the Man, in Scripture Language, is to be coura∣gious in Battle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Samuel</HI> 10.12.</NOTE>.

<P><HI>Sirs,</HI> if when God's Hand is lifted up, we will not see and acknowledge his Controversy with us, if, when he speaks to us in the Language of Thunder by his awful Rod, we will not hear his Voice, if, while his <HI>Judgments are abroad in the Earth,</HI> we refuse <HI>to learn Righteousness, walk contrary to God,</HI> and harden ourselves in our Impieties like <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> Jehovah will <HI>punish us seven Times for our Iniquities, he will surely break us with Breach upon Breach, and run upon us like a Giant, he will destroy and devour at once, he will stir up Jealousy like a Man of War, he shall cry, yea, roar, he shall prevail against his Enemies!</HI> nor will our religious Profession, screen us from the Strokes of his angry Rod; no, <HI>Judgment shall begin first at the House of God,</HI> and because <HI>Jehovah</HI> has done more for us than many other Nations, therefore will he punish us for our ungrateful Abuse of his Goodness, if we remain impenitent!</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="007799_0026_102D8CF49CCA0E60"/>If, while the <HI>Lord is forming Evil against us, we will not return from our evil Ways, and make our Ways and our Doings good, Jehovah will scatter us as with an East Wind before the Enemy, and shew us the Back and not the Face in the Day of our Calamity!</HI> In brief, if we will not mourn over our own Sins, and the Sins of our Nation and Land, and reform our Ways, no human Mea∣sures, how apt soever, will protect us from the just and terrible Vengeance of an angry God, we shall sooner or later meet with the Ruin and Destruction our Impieties deserve<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is Matter of Reproach and Lamentation, that since our late Troubles, there have been in the publick Papers, many vain Boastings of our Courage and Strength, <HI>and vain Confidence of Success,</HI> meerly by the Force of our <HI>Fleets</HI> and Armies, without any Regard to <HI>God</HI> and his <HI>Providence;</HI> this is as imprudent as impious; he that girds on his Harness should not boast as he that puts it off Such Infidel contempt of God, as it is an Argument of the dreadful Degeneracy of our Nation, so it is a low Imitation of the <HI>French Gasconade,</HI> an Impiety suffi∣cient to bring the Blast of angry Heaven upon all our Measures; may God gra∣ciously pardon the bold Affront to his Crown and Dignity, and save our sinful Nation and Land from the Desolations we deserve for it.</NOTE>; And, indeed, before this general Reformation takes place, the very Removal of Judgments for a Time, is, itself, a Judgment, like the abus'd Re∣prieve of a condemn'd Criminal for a little Moment before his Ex∣ecution.</P>
<P>But if while the Almighty is threat'ning <HI>to pluck up, pull down and destroy our Nation, we turn from our Evil, viz.</HI> the Evil of Sin, <HI>he will repent of the Evil he thought to do to us, viz.</HI> the Evil of Punishment, <HI>i. e.</HI> he will, by his Providence, deliver us from the threat'ned Calamity; an affecting Instance of which we have in the People of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> who when they heard the divine Threat|'ning by <HI>Jonah, believed God, fasted, prayed, reformed, and were</HI> delivered from Destruction; <HI>for God saw their Works, that they turn'd from their Evil Way.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> there is Need of civil as well as spiritual Means in the present Case; for therein we have not only to do with God, but with Men like ourselves, who are industriously u∣sing both the Methods of <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Force</HI> to ruin and destroy us, we should therefore <HI>prepare</HI> for our <HI>Defence,</HI> and for <HI>Recempensing the In∣juries
<PB N="27" REF="007799_0027_102D8813F4854448"/>
done to us upon our Enemies:</HI> I cannot therefore but highly com∣mend the Measures lately taken in this City by divers of the Inha∣bitants, in voluntarily forming themselves into Companies, in or∣der to <HI>learn the Art of War,</HI> that they may be ready upon any Im∣mergency to defend themselves and others with a Probability of Success.</P>
<P><HI>Gentlemen,</HI> In this you conform to the Counsel of the wisest of Men, and the Example of the best; <HI>Solomon</HI> observes, That <HI>the pru∣dent Man soresees Evil, and bides himself, but the Simple pass on, and are punished;</HI> but how does the prudent Man hide himself? not by a cowardly Flight from Danger, but by <HI>preparing for Defence!</HI> and hence the <HI>Father of the Faithful</HI> was induced to train up his numerous Family in the <HI>Use of Arms,</HI> which his unhappy Brother, with many others, reduced to a State of Captivity, soon found the Advantage of.</P>
<P>This Undertaking, <HI>Gentlemen,</HI> is so much the more excellent and worthy of Commendation, as it is disinterested and voluntary, tho' attended with Fatigue and Expence: Hereby you act up to the Reason of Men and the Zeal of Christians, of Protestants, of <HI>Bri∣tons!</HI> expressing by Action a real Reward to your Religion and Liberty, to your King and Country, to your Friends and dear Re∣latives; for by this Undertaking you declare that you will not tamely and sordidly give them all up to the Lusts of our inveterate Enemies, without striking a stroke in their Defence: Go on, <HI>Sirs,</HI> in the Name of God, and be not discouraged by any Difficul∣ties or Reflections you may meet with in the Prosecution of your Design, which is honest and honourable, and of Service to your Country!</P>
<P>Now in order to prosper herein, give me Leave with Humility and Earnestness to intreat you, to endeavour with Speed and Vehe∣mence to be sincerely <HI>religious</HI> yourselves; this is the best Prepara∣tive for hazardous Enterprizes, the best Foundation of undisguised <HI>Patriotism,</HI> and undaunted <HI>Courage,</HI> as well as the most probable Mean to obtain <HI>Success,</HI> to this End therefore bewail your Offences against God, accept of the Redeemer, and obey his Laws.</P>
<P>Be clothed with <HI>Humility,</HI> by this you will adorn your military Character, be better prepar'd to serve the Publick, and inclin'd to
<PB N="28" REF="007799_0028_102D8D14A087BE58"/>
avoid those unhappy Contentions which spring from <HI>Pride</HI> as their Source, and are as scandalous as prejudicial to Society, not only by marring the Comfort of it, but by rendering (frequently) the most noble Designs, and promising Appearances, abortive.</P>
<P>Beware, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> of a narrow, bitter <HI>Party-Spirit,</HI> slight not each other because of different Sentiments in Religion or Poli∣ticks, for such a Diversity is unavoidable in the present State of Imperfection: However you may differ in other Matters, yet agree in this common and noble Cause, <HI>the Defence of your Country,</HI> and the rather because by its excellent Constitution, it maintains your <HI>Religious Liberty</HI> inviolate!</P>
<P>O preserve the Union of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Love</HI> among yourselves, without this your military Associations are neither like to be ho∣nourable or comfortable to yourselves, or serviceable to your Country; and seeing your Companies are not formed by the Con∣straint of Authority, but by your own Choice, and have no Pros∣pect of private Interest to encourage their Continuance; there is of Consequence the greater Need of the aforesaid Union, without which they are not like to be of long Duration.</P>
<P>But I proceed to offer a few Words to such of the Inhabitants of this City, who have not hitherto join'd in the late <HI>Associations for Defence,</HI> or <HI>military Companies: My Friends and Brethren,</HI> when any, in a Time of publick Danger and Distress, freely and voluntarily of their own Motion, <HI>offer themselves</HI> to defend their Country by <HI>Force</HI> and <HI>Arms,</HI> and avenge its Wrongs, it furnishes sufficient Matter for Thankfulness and Praise to Almighty God, who has stirr'd them up thereto, and gives great Pleasure and Delight to such as have their Country's Good at Heart; but the Enemies of our Religion and Liberty are griev'd at such a Sight. (See <HI>Judges</HI> 5. 2. 9. And <HI>Nehemiah</HI> 2.10, 19, 20.) <HI>Praise ye the Lord for the avenging of Israel, when the People, willingly offered themselves; my Heart is towards the Governors of Israel, that offered themselves willingly among the People, bless ye the Lord! When Sanballet the Horonite, and Tobiah, the Servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it griev'd them exceedingly, that there was come a Man to seek the Welfare of the Children of Israel: Then said I unto them, Ye see the Distress that we are in, how Jerusalem lyeth
<PB N="29" REF="007799_0029_102D8D17C3BAB258"/>
waste, come and let us build up the Wall, that we be no more a Reproach; but they laught us to Scorn, and despised us; then answered I them, and said, the God of Heaven he will prosper us, therefore we his Servants will arise and build, but you have no Portion, nor right, nor Memorial in Jeru∣salem!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Sirs,</HI> It is exceeding agreeable to devout Minds, and God shou'd be acknowledged for it, when not only Persons of a lower Order, but those of the highest, are VOLUNTEERS in the Cause of their God and their Country, and appear in Arms in Defence thereof, altho' they might plead Excuse because of their Dignity; <HI>My Heart is to∣wards the Governors of Israel, that offer'd themselves willingly among the People;</HI> As if the gallant inspir'd Heroine <HI>Deborah</HI> had said, I high∣ly esteem and heartily love those brave <HI>Patriots,</HI> who do not insist upon the little Punctillio's of their Honour, when all their religi∣ous and civil Privileges are at Stake; no, great Souls, in such important Conjunctures, treat such Trifles with a noble Negligence; surely those Eagles will not meanly drop their sublime Flight, to catch Flies, nor foolishly lose the Substance by grasping at a Shadow!</P>
<P>I would therefore entreat you, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> to encourage these <HI>military Companies,</HI> by joining in them, and punctually attending the Times of their Exercises, as well as by blessing God for them, and imploring his Blessing upon them!</P>
<P>But I return to offer a brief Address to the <HI>military Gentlemen</HI> of this City, and others; <HI>Sirs,</HI> If it should please Providence to call you to any Engagement against our Enemies, with Design either to assist or pretect your distressed <HI>Brethren,</HI> or avenge the Affronts of your <HI>Sovereign,</HI> and your <HI>Country's</HI> Wrongs; I hope you are determin'd by divine Help to undertake the important Enterprize with Readiness, and to prosecute it with Resolution, Bravery and Firmness; <HI>for happy shall he be, that rewardeth them as they have served us.</HI> The <HI>Cause</HI> is just and important, if any Thing is or can be so, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Defence</HI> of our Country, and all the <HI>Religious and Civil</HI> Privileges which that endearing Word contains! The <HI>Reward</HI> is great, unspeakably great, in this and a future World; and the <HI>Work</HI> to a pious, generous and heroick Mind truly noble, desira∣ble, and amiable!</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="007799_0030_102D8D1A0CE45E88"/>My Heart bleeds for this ravaged Country, especially for our poor Brethren in the back Parts of it, many of whom have been mercilesly sacrificed by the <HI>Pagan Savages,</HI> and the Remainder re∣duc'd to such Circumstances of Distress and Woe, as are enough to pierce a Heart of Iron, of Adamant; <HI>My Bowels, my Bowels, I am pained at my very Heart! thou hast heard, O my Soul, the Alarm of War, Destruction upon Destruction is cry'd! for the whole Land is spoil'd! O that my Head were Waters, and mine Eyes a Fountain of Tears, that I might weep Day and Night for the Slain of the Daughter of my People!</HI> Can ye endure, <HI>Sirs,</HI> without the tenderest Sympathy, the strongest Emotion, to see our Brethren, our Fellow-Subjects, our Fellow-Protestants, massacred by <HI>Indian</HI> Banditti, under <HI>popish</HI> Influence, without any Assistance? No, surely! or where are Patriotism and <HI>British</HI> Bravery fled away?</P>
<P>You all know, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> the dismal Consequences of a <HI>French,</HI> a <HI>Popish</HI> Government, that in such a Situation you must be deprived of your <HI>Estates</HI> and <HI>civil Liberty,</HI> which are no inconsiderable Loss: But, what is infinitely more, you must either sin, or suffer the most barbarous Severities; witness the Sufferings of the brave <HI>Wildenses,</HI> the <HI>Torments</HI> of the <HI>Inquisition,</HI> the <HI>Fires</HI> of <HI>Smithfield</HI> in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> the <HI>Parisian Massacre</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">At that Metropolis, where the leading Persons of the Protestant Body in that Nation were invited, under the specious Umbrage of a Marriage with a Protestant Prince) the King of <HI>Navarre,</HI> after the strongest Professions of Friendship, and an Oath of Safe conduct, began in the dead of the Night the must horrid and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, which so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> spread into other Parts of the Kingdom, whereby a Hundred Thousand Persons were cruelly murdered, and among them many of distinguished Eminence, particularly one of the greatest and bravest Men that ever <HI>France</HI> produced, viz. Admiral <HI>Coligni.</HI> Hereby the Foundation was laid for the total Overthrow of that great Number of Churches mentioned in the Sermon. By this crimson, unequal'd Perfidy, the <HI>Papists</HI> shew'd their inviolable Adherence to that traitorous Tenet, <HI>viz. That Faith is not to be kept with</HI> (such as they falsely call) <HI>Hereticks:</HI> Yet, be astonished O Heavens! this bloody Villany, at which an honest Heathen would blush, was applauded by the <HI>Romish</HI> Conclave.</NOTE>, by which one and twenty Hundred Protestant Churches were reduced to Ruins, the <HI>Massacre</HI> in <HI>Ireland,</HI> in one Province of which 140 Thousand Protestants were murdered. <HI>Sirs,</HI> The Fraud, the Perjury, the In∣humanity,

the Barbarity, and Horrors of the aforesaid Popish Scene, cannot be parallel'd in <HI>civil Story,</HI> and are too big for the Powers of Language fully to express, or set in a strong enough Light.</P>
<P>It is a Thousand Times better to be under the Government of <HI>Turks</HI> than <HI>Papists,</HI> for there we might enjoy some Liberty, but here none at all; there are not such bloody, tyrannical Task-masters under the whole Heaven as the <HI>Papists,</HI> we have therefore Reason to dread their Government more than Death itself; Death, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> in the Field of Battle, the Bed of Honour, while nobly contending for our Religion and Liberty, is infinite∣ly preferable to the sordid Life of a Slave, or a Hypocrite under the worst of Tyrants; yea, in such a Death, there is something so sublime, grand, and noble, in preferring the Safety of the Church and State to our own, to our very Lives, that it cannot but be a∣greable to great, to good, and heroick Minds; such must there∣fore have disorder'd Understandings, or cowardly, little, selfish Souls, who want to sleep in a whole Skin, or sordidly to spare their Cash, when their Country is bleeding to Death? <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> 11.24. There is that scattereth, and yet encreaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to Poverty.</NOTE> It would be inglorious and base, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> to survive the Catastrophe of our Country, to survive the Ruin of our dear religious Liberty! No, it is better by far, greatly to fall and die with them in the Field of Battle, and be buried in one Grave! Should we therefore deserve the Character of Men, of Christians, of Protestants, of <HI>Britons,</HI> if we sold cheap into the Hands of our cruel Enemies, those precious Privileges which have been committed to us by our Ancestors, as a sacred Trust, to be by us convey'd to the succeed∣ing Generation; Privileges that have been the Price of much Blood in many Ages, and in many Nations; no, <HI>Sirs,</HI> we should deserve not only to be unchurch'd, but drove from the Society of Men to herd with Beasts. But, <HI>my Hearers,</HI> I am persuaded ye detest such sneaking Meanness, which manifests those that are guilty of it, to be Monsters of human Nature, Prodigies of Trea∣chery, Ingratitude and Meanness. Allow me to add one Consider∣ation

more, which shews that the <HI>Opposers of Defence,</HI> in the present Case, are without all Umbrage of Apology, and that is this, that the <HI>Indian</HI> Tribes who are now distressing this Province by Fire and Sword, are by Treaties (of Right the Subjects of King <HI>George the Second,</HI> which Treaties they have perfidiously broken, and commenc'd Rebels again their lawful Prince; now if it be not lawful and necessary to punish Rebels, then certainly Govern∣ment itself to unlawful, and Rebellion against the best of Kings no Crime; which nevertheless the Holy Scriptures represent to be as <HI>the Sin of Witchcraft:</HI> Now whether Opposing of or Indifferency about punishing the Rebel-subjects of our gracious Sovereign be consistent either with civil Government, or with Loyalty, I leave to others to determine. Let us all therefore, <HI>my dear Brethren,</HI> in so clear, so important a Cause, as one Man arise, and exert our∣selves to the utmost, let us think and speak, and act to one dying Breath, agreeable to the noble Strains of the Psalmist and Prophet, <HI>If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my Right Hand forget her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, let my Tongue cleave to the Roof of my Mouth, if I prefer not Jerusalem to my chief Joy: For</HI> Jerusalem's <HI>sake I will not hold my Peace, and for Zion's sake I will not be silent, until the Righteousness thereof go forth as Bright∣ness, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth:</HI> But the Time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, I must not enlarge: In one Word, every Consideration that ought to Influence a human Soul, conspires to incite you to vindicate your Sovereign's Honour, to preserve your <HI>Religious</HI> and <HI>Liberty,</HI> to relieve your suffering Brethren, and avenge your Country's Wrong: I conclude with the Words of our Text, <HI>O Daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed, happy shall he be, who re∣wardeth thee, as thou hast served us!</HI> AMEN and AMEN.</P>
