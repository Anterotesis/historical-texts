<HEAD>Reasons for Inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ntinence.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE women all tell me I'm false to my lass,</L>
<L>That I quit my poor Chloe, and stick to my glass:</L>
<L>But to you man of reason, my reason, I'll own;</L>
<L>And if you don't like them, why let them alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Although I have left her the truth I'll declare,</L>
<L>I believe she was good, and I'm sure she was fair:</L>
<L>But such goodness and charms in a bumper I see;</L>
<L>That it makes it as good and as charming as she.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Chloe had dimples and smiles I must own.</L>
<L>But though she could smile, yet in truth she could frown;</L>
<L>But tell me ye lovers of liquors divine,</L>
<L>Did you ever see a frown in a bumper of wine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her lilies and roses were just in their prime;</L>
<L>Yet lilies and roses are conquer'd by time;</L>
<L>But in wine from its age such a benefit flows,</L>
<L>That I like it the better the older it grows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They tell me my love would in time have been cloy'd,</L>
<L>And that beauty's insipid when once 'tis enjoy'd;</L>
<L>But in wine, I both time and enjoyment defy,</L>
<L>For the longer I drink the more thirsty am I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let murders, and battles, and history prove</L>
<L>The mischiefs that wait upon rivals in love;</L>
<L>But in drinking, thank Heav'n, no rival con∣tends;</L>
<L>For the more we love liquor, the more we are friends.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She too might have poison'd the joys of my life</L>
<L>With nurses, and babies, and squalling, and strife;</L>
<L><PB N="46" REF="036834_0047_100B1A0182D478D8"/>
But my wine neither nurses nor babies can bring.</L>
<L>And a big belly'd bottle's a mighty good thing,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We shorten our days when with love we engage;</L>
<L>It brings on diseases, and hastens old age:</L>
<L>But wine from grim death can its votaries save,</L>
<L>And keep out t'other leg when there's one in the grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps, like her sex ever false to their word,</L>
<L>She had left me—to get an estate or a lord;</L>
<L>But my bumper, regarding nor titles nor pelf,</L>
<L>Will stand by me when I can't stand by myself.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then let my dear Chloe no longer complain,</L>
<L>She's rid of her lover and I of my pain;</L>
<L>For in wine, mighty wine, many comforts I spy,</L>
<L>Should you doubt what I say, take a pumper and try.</L>

<L>It's all about Blunder O'Whack of Kilka<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ny,</L>
<L>Who took once from Dublin to London a trip,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or staying at home why I thought it all blar∣ney,</L>
<L>So set off and walk'd all the way in a ship.</L>

<P>With my whack, &amp;c.</P>

<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or I'd an ould unele I tell you my honey.</L>
<L>Who died in the morning one night t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>other day,</L>
<L>And he very civilly lest me all his money.</L>
<L>Because, why, he could'nt well take it away;</L>
<L>So when I had money I rode it in chaises,</L>
<L>And look'd very big upon those that had none,</L>
<L>For he that has no cash may walk if he pleases,</L>
<L>Or if that don't please him, why then he must run.</L>
</LG>
<P>With my whack, &amp;c.</P>
<LG>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o to London I came, and I thought it it so pretty,</L>
<L>To see the folks crowding along in the street,</L>
<L>Where a body may walk from the strand to the city,</L>
<L>And run up against every soul that you meet;</L>
<L>And then there's the gentry so nate and so nim∣ble,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> if to the business they born were and bred,</L>
<L><PB N="89" REF="036834_0090_100B1A6D5B278DA8"/>
Who can slip off a watch, or a purse, or a thim∣ble,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your pockets can pick, of the hat off your head.</L>
</LG>
<P>With my whack, &amp;c.</P>
<LG>
<L>Then there's Huge's and Astley's odd whimseys and capers</L>
<L>Where horses have every perfection but speech,</L>
<L>And the jockies all ride as you read in the papers,</L>
<L>On three horses at once, with a leg upon each;</L>
<L>And there's your si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s and battles so clever,</L>
<L>Where wooden battalions all join in the strife,</L>
<L>And soldiers of pasteboard each other dissever,</L>
<L>And all the dead men look as natural as life.</L>
</LG>
<P>With my whack. &amp;c.</P>
<LG>
<L>Then for Dublin I travell'd all night and all day,</L>
<L>While the ship in the water was led such a dance,</L>
<L>That somehow we found she'd mistaken her way,</L>
<L>And instead of dear Dublin we landed in France;</L>
<L>Where, if a man dare his opinion to mention,</L>
<L>Besore he can speak it they chop off his head!</L>
<L>For those ugly spalpeens that are call'd the Con∣vention,</L>
<L>Never try a poor fellow till after he's dead.</L>
</LG>
<P>With a whack, &amp;c.</P>
<LG>
<L>And so by my conscience I left them behind, Sir,</L>
<L>And soon made the best of my way from the south;</L>
<L><PB N="90" REF="036834_0091_100B1A70988AE1F8"/>
For how did I know but they might be so kind, Sir,</L>
<L>As to send home O'Whack with his head in his mouth.</L>
<L>And to London return'd, I was pleas'd d'ye see, Sir.</L>
<L>To think from those blood hounds I safe had got back,</L>
<L>For if they had happen'd to Guillotine me, Sir,</L>
<L>'Twould have spoil'd all the singing of Blun∣der O'Whack.</L>

<HEAD>The Miller.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ONE midsummer morning, when nature look'd gay,</L>
<L>The birds full of frolic, the lambs full of play,</L>
<L>When earth seem'd to answer her smiles from above,</L>
<L>And all things proclaim'd in the season for love.</L>
<L>My mother cry'd, Nancy go haste to the mill,</L>
<L>If the corn is not ground <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou may scold if you will.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The freedom to use my tongue pleas'd me no doubt,</L>
<L>For a woman, alas! would be nothing without:</L>
<L>I went toward the mill without any delay,</L>
<L>And conn'd o'er the words I intended to say;</L>
<L>But when I came near her I found her stock still,</L>
<L>Bless my stars! now cry'd I, huff him rarely I will</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The miller to market that instant was gone,</L>
<L>And the work was all lest to the care of his son.</L>
<L><PB N="91" REF="036834_0092_100B1A67757C4A90"/>
And though I could scold as well as any woman can,</L>
<L>Yet I thought it would be wrong for to scold the young man;</L>
<L>I said I'm surpris'd you can use me so ill,</L>
<L>Sir, I must have my corn ground, I must and I will.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sweet maid cry'd the youth, the neglect is not mine,</L>
<L>There's no corn in the town I'd grind sooner than thine;</L>
<L>There's no one more willing to pleasure the fair,</L>
<L>The mill shall go mer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ily round I declare:</L>
<L>But hark how the birds fing, and hear how they bill,</L>
<L>Now I must have a kiss first, I must and I will.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My corn being ground, I to home bent my way;</L>
<L>He whisper'd he'd something of moment to say,</L>
<L>Insisted to hand me along the green mead,</L>
<L>And there swore he loved me indeed and in∣deed;</L>
<L>And that he'd be constant and true to me still,</L>
<L>So since that time I lov'd him, and love him I will.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I often say, mother, the miller I'll huff,</L>
<L>She laughs and says, Go girl, and plague him enough;</L>
<L>But scarce a day passes, but by her desire,</L>
<L>I steal a sly kiss from the youth I admire;</L>
<L>If wedlock he wishes, his wish I'll fulfil,</L>
<L>And I'll answer, O yes, with a hearty good-will</L>
