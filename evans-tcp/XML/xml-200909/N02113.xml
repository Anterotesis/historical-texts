<HEAD>A Defence, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HAVE read the <HI>Sober Remarks</HI> on the <HI>Modest Proof,</HI> &amp;c. whereon you ask my Opinion: And since all your Desires have with me the force of Commands, I now transmit to you my Thoughts and Observations on that Performance.</P>
<P>IF that Author took the Title for his Text, I find him following a Method too common, in leaving it as soon as mentioned, and all along keeping at a Distance from it far and wide; and that therefore the Adjective is by no means applicable to the Animadversions.</P>
<P>HE was doubtless in this misled by a vulgar Error, which often runs through the Conduct of Humane Life, the not observing the Distin∣ction founded in Religion, [2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.1.] be∣tween Sins of the Flesh, and Sins of the Spirit; in such as do not consider, that Envy and Ma∣lice,
<PB N="4" REF="002510_0004_0FDB642050BC6898"/>
Heretical Opinions and Inclinations, for <HI>Schism</HI> and <HI>Sedition,</HI> are as heinous Provocations in the sight of Heaven, as the fruition of the forbidden Pleasures of the Animal Life. Hence some with a seeming Solemnity worship God at <HI>Meeting,</HI> but Mammon in the Heart and Closet; abhor Idols, yet love Sacrilege; forbear Swear∣ing, but strongly incline to Lie and Over-reach; and observe the <HI>Saturday Evening</HI> with a Jewish nicety, and on the succeeding, fall into all the Works of the Gentiles, that can be contained within the Veil of Hypocrisy.</P>
<P>THIS Observation might be run through eve∣ry Precept of the Second Table, tho' I shall for my Purpose only instance in that which relates to Riot and Excess; where we may take No∣tice, that besides drinking to a Debauch, there is another kind of Intemperance flowing from the bilious Ferment of the Passions, and the Fumes of <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> and a heared Fancy.</P>
<P>HAD the Author of the <HI>Remarks</HI> duly ob∣served this, he could never have prefixed so im∣proper an Epithet as that of <HI>Sober</HI> unto them. I don't indeed know that he is a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the grosser Meaning of the Word, yet I think there is no Proposition in <HI>Euclid</HI> more demonstrable, than that the Guilt of Intemperance taken in the last Sense is chargeable upon him. And to show you that all the Symptoms and Disorders of that Vice are applicable to him, and that by Consequence his <HI>Remarks</HI> could not be <HI>Sober</HI> ones, I shall represent him unto you, as appear∣ing really to be under all the Signatures of the Crime of Intemperance.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002510_0005_0FDB6422D042DB68"/>WE may discern a Person to be under this Disorder by these Marks and Signs.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> THAT his Head is full of delirious <HI>Vi∣sions</HI> and <HI>Delusions</HI> imagining <HI>chimerical Existences.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THAT he is so tenacious of his Opi∣nions, that he is full Proof against Conviction by the clearest Evidence, but thinks himself privi∣ledged to affirm or deny at his pleasure, without any other Satisfaction than his Word.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THAT he is very inconsistent in his Talk, and apt to contradict himself, as well as others.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> THAT he is soon angry, and often very quarrelsome, even without Provocation.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>NOW it these Spots are remarkably discern∣able, in the <HI>Remarker</HI>'s Countenance, I hope is will be granted, that these <HI>Remarks</HI> will not be allowed the Performance of a Person under a <HI>sober</HI> Character: And that they evidently appear in him, will be clear and manifest by observing.</P>
<P>First, THAT his Head seems giddilly to swim (as if there was a Vortex in his Brain) with deli∣rious Visions and delusive Phantoms, his Fancy representing to him Images that are meer Chi∣meras, which never had nor ever could have any real Existence; thus by a sudden Whirl, Saints and Sinners instantly change Places in his vertiginous Imagination, and by the nimble Powers of Transformation, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, by his own Confession a worthy good <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, is changed into an Heretick, and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> the Heretick in the Opinion of the Ancients, becomes an Orthodox Divine.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002510_0006_0FDB6426E82DF708"/>THUS the Visionary paints on his Fancy, Cardinal <HI>Wolsey,</HI> Arch-Bishop <HI>Cranmer,</HI> and Su∣perintendant <HI>Spotswood,</HI> in a <HI>Geneva</HI> Dress, hold∣ing forth to Independant Congregations: For this is the certain Consequence of his affirming, that both <HI>Papists</HI> and <HI>Protestants</HI> were against <HI>E∣piscopacy</HI> at the Reformation; whereas it is un∣disputable Fact, that this was the Government of the <HI>Church</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> since the planting of Chri∣stianity in it to this very Day, excepting the Anarchy from 1641, to 1660. and that the <HI>Church</HI> was reformed by <HI>Bishops,</HI> who afterwards became <HI>Martyrs</HI> under their <HI>Episcopal Characters;</HI> who must in the <HI>Remarker</HI>'s Judgment been Fools, or Knaves, or both, to have practised even un∣to Death, so contrary to the Principles he dreams they had.</P>
<P>AND as for <HI>Scotland,</HI> there is nothing clearer in History, than that the <HI>Church</HI> at and after the Reformation there, was governed by <HI>Superintend∣ants,</HI> whose Office was so far from being an Anti-prelatical Creation, as the <HI>Remarker</HI> fondly ima∣gines, that it differed in nothing from <HI>Episcopacy</HI> but the Name; and it is not to be disputed, but that the Reformation not only in <HI>Britain,</HI> but in all Monarchical Governments, was carried on by <HI>Praelates;</HI> as in <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> and in∣deed every where, save in a few <HI>Republican</HI> States, such as <HI>Holland</HI> and <HI>Geneva,</HI> where their Church-Government was framed to their Ple∣bean Schemes. No Man whose Head was not strangely turned, would imagine the <HI>Fathers</HI> on the <HI>Remarker</HI>'s Side, who all with one Breath
<PB N="7" REF="002510_0007_0FDB6428D5F66020"/>
condemn his Opinions. Tho' with equal Man∣ners and Assurance that he provokes unto their Judgment, he dispises it, and contemns the Au∣thority of <HI>Antiquity,</HI> for this very good Reason, because it testifies against him. In fine, who but a silly Dreamer could have feigned himself an <HI>Apostle,</HI> or rather some body of a superiour Character, in giving and taking away Com∣missions at his pleasure, and which have no Foundation but in Fancy, to be sure not in the <HI>sacred Pages.</HI> It is with difficulty that he will allow <HI>Stephen</HI> to be a Preacher, tho' I think we have a good long Sermon of his <HI>Acts</HI> 7. But as to <HI>Philip,</HI> the Instance is so flagrant of his preach∣ing and baptizing, that there was no other way to condemn the <HI>Episcopal Deacon</HI> following that Practice, than by framing a new Commission for <HI>Philip:</HI> For he would not allow the Powers for his Practice were contained in his <HI>Diaconate;</HI> however we call upon him and his Brethren for a sight of an authentick Copy of that Commissi∣on upon Divine Record, which because we are sure they can't produce, we can't but firmly adhere to our Opinion, that the second Com∣mission is an imaginary Fiction. And since so good Men would not be found in these Ministe∣rial Functions without a <HI>Mission,</HI> we must con∣clude that they discharged them in the virtue of that which they received, at the imposition of the <HI>Apostles</HI> Hands, <HI>Acts</HI> 6.6. But this will be anon more fully considered; this Instance with the foregoing being only here adduced, to dis∣cover the Disorders the <HI>Remarker</HI> was under,
<PB N="8" REF="002510_0008_0FDB642A5822FC50"/>
having his Head full of delireous <HI>Visions</HI> and <HI>De∣lusions,</HI> imagining <HI>chimerical Existences,</HI> and there∣fore could not with any Truth or Honesty prefix the Epithet of <HI>Sober</HI> to his <HI>Remarks.</HI> Nor could he, if we consider</P>
<P>Secondly, THAT he is so tenacious of his Opinions, that he is full Proof against Convicti∣on by the clearest Evidence, but thinks himself privileged to affirm or deny at his pleasure, without any other Satisfaction than his Word.</P>
<P>TO prove this Charge upon him, I shall make it appear, that he has without any Ground de∣nied the Distinction of the three Orders of <HI>New Testament</HI> Ministers, with their proper Functions and Administrations, as retained in the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England;</HI> and without any Proof introduced Officers and Offices into the <HI>Gospel Ministry,</HI> not founded in Scripture, and Strangers to the <HI>Church of Christ,</HI> in its best and purest Times. Now for the evincing of this Charge, wherein lies the Merits of the Cause, and whereon the Hinge of the whole Controversy turns, I shall proceed gradually, and make it good in every one of those Orders.</P>
<P>FIRST then, to begin with the lowest, that of <HI>Deacons,</HI> we must consider that Office in the Reason of its Institution, and the Exercise of it; it's plain they were appointed to take some Charge and Care from off the <HI>Apostle</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Offices of the Ministry, as their Name im∣ports, part whereof was to distribute the Ele∣ments at the Celebration of the Lord's Supper, as well as to supervise the <HI>Churches Treasury,</HI> and
<PB N="9" REF="002510_0009_0FDB642E9AD5C428"/>
supply the Poor; but these Services do not seem to include all that was implied in their designation to this Office, and that for these two Reasons: First. For these only there seems no necessity for so great a Solemnity as an <HI>Or∣dination</HI> by the <HI>Apostolick Hands.</HI> And secondly, Because we find some of them actually employ∣ed in more sacred Functions, for which they doubtless then received their Power and Orders. For we don't find they received any for those sacred Ministrations at any other Time: Now since they could not preach without being sent, and that it don't appear they were sent at any Time but this we are upon, it must be granted, that either they now received their Powers for the ministerial Functions of Preaching and Bap∣tizing, or that they acted without any, and were intruders on the sacred Function. But this is impious and absurd, therefore they were now ordained to those Parts of the Ministry, they afterwards discharged with so much Diligence and Success. And now let us view what those Parts were, in the exercise whereof we find any of them; for from their Practice, we may well conclude that of all the rest. There are but two of those <HI>Deacons,</HI> whose Acts are more par∣ticularly taken notice of by the <HI>sacred Historian,</HI> One of then, as has been already hinted, we find has left us an excellent Sermon <HI>Acts</HI> 7. and the other we know preached so successfully, as to gain many Converts, whom he also baptized, <HI>Acts</HI> 8. And besides these, we don't find any o∣ther Act. of their Ministration in holy Things:
<PB N="10" REF="002510_0010_0FDB642F8FB8DF30"/>
For tho' they assisted indeed at the Lord's Ta∣ble, yet we don't find that ever they consecrated the Elements, or ever were vested with the Powers of <HI>Absolution</HI> or <HI>Censures,</HI> but rather the contrary is implied <HI>Acts</HI> 8.14, 18. For that af∣ter the <HI>Samaritans</HI> were baptized by <HI>Philip the Deacon,</HI> the <HI>Apostles Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> went from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> to <HI>Samaria</HI> to confirm the new Con∣verts.</P>
<P>NOW let us see how the <HI>Church of England Deacon</HI> comes up to the Institution and the Ex∣ercise of the Office; after he is recommended, tried, approved and found meet for it, he is so∣lemnly ordained by laying on of Hands, invested with Power to serve Tables, provide for the Poor, to preach and to baptize, but not to ad∣minister the Lord's Supper; as that implies the Act of Consecration, nor remit or retain Sins, in our Saviour's Sence of those Words, but as for the <HI>dissinting Deacon,</HI> if ever, he is very rarely ordained, and to be sure never to the Offices of preaching and baptizing; and pray now who comes nearest to the primitive Institution, and the manifest Acts of that Office? the <HI>Church of England,</HI> which desires to obey Divine Com∣mands, and be guided in her Conduct by Divine Examples, and in this Instance comes as near the Pattern as is possible for Imitation, or those who sacrilegiously mutilate this Office, and de∣prive it of the best and most useful Parts there∣of: And therefore who that was <HI>sober</HI> and in his Senses, could have expressed his Virulence a∣gainst the preaching <HI>Deacon,</HI> as the <HI>Remarker</HI> has
<PB N="11" REF="002510_0011_0FDB64312A483BE8"/>
done, to say no worse in Language like his Cause, and therefore evident it is upon the whole and must be owned, that those <HI>Remarks</HI> on this the lowest Office in the <HI>Evangelical Ministry,</HI> betray a Mind full of Confusion and Disorder, and therefore that they could never be the neat Produce of a <HI>sober</HI> Man, nor they ever justly claim an Epithet they have no Title to. From hence let us proceed,</P>
<P>Secondly, TO the next Order, that of <HI>Pres∣byters,</HI> and see if there be any more Marks of Sobriety on the <HI>Remarks</HI> on their Order than on the former; and here I think it will be obvious to every Eye, that the further he goes, the fur∣ther he staggers from the Truth, until he falls into gross Absurdities, from whence he cannot recover himself, from these Reflections.</P>
<P>THE Author of the <HI>Modest Proof</HI> had alledged with a great deal of Reason, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> were Successors to the <HI>Seventy Disciples,</HI> who by many Marks of Imparity by him there adduced, and not yet disproved, were in an Office inferiour in Dignity and Power unto the <HI>Apostolate.</HI> Now he seems extreamly concerned to expunge this Notion, and blots several Pages, to blot <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commission; and so fiercely contends against the Perpetuity of it, that upon the Sup∣position of its continuing, he would grant <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> to be their proper Successors. Now upon this Concession we will join Issue with him and give up the Cause, if we don't make appear, that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commission continued after the Time he affirms it determined; and that the
<PB N="12" REF="002510_0012_0FDB6432A5CFB000"/>
Grounds he goes upon are absurd, suppositious and contrary to Fact and the Reason of Things, he affirms but without Proof, that their Com∣mission is not now in being, inasmuch as it ex∣pired with themselves, or rather at their Return unto our Lord, and that it was limited only to <HI>Judea.</HI> Now if these Premisses be not true, the Conclusion that he would draw from them must needs be false; and that there is no Truth in either of those Pretences, will be clear as Light, from the following Considerations on each of them.</P>
<P>First, THAT that Commission having never been formally revoked, and the Reasons where∣on it was granted continuing, it must also con∣tinue as long as they do.</P>
<P>Secondly, SO far it is from being true, that it was revoked at their Return, that they were then furnished with new Powers for the Exer∣cise of those Functions it authorised them unto.</P>
<P>First, I say the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commission having never been formally revoked, and the Reasons whereon it was granted continuing, it must also continue as long as they do. There is a pro∣found Silence in the <HI>Gospel</HI> about the Revoca∣tion of that Commission, not the least Inuendo that glances that way, no Account of the Time, Place, and Person, when, where, or by whom it was taken from them, and they discharged from that Service; and therefore he must have a hardy Front, that would affirm this Commissi∣on to have been formally revoked. And that it was not virtually so, is still, if possible, more
<PB N="13" REF="002510_0013_0FDB64370FDCE9C0"/>
evident, for the Reasons of its first Institution continuing, it must be of the same Duration with them; Now these Reasons we have <HI>Luke</HI> 10.2. The greatness of the Harvest, and the fewness of the Labourers, and since the Harvest will continue until the last Conflagration, so must the Labourers, and by Consequence their Commission for it. The <HI>Remarker</HI> therefore must be guilty of this absurd Supposition, That the Harvest is over, since the Labourers Commission to work therein, is according to him, annulled; unless he will still more absurdly suppose, that there is a Harvest and no Labourers in it. But since both these Suppositions are false in Fact, and blasphemous Imputations on the Wisdom of its Master; and that therefore the Harvest will continue to the last period of Time, so must the Labourers Work, and their Commission for it, run in a Line parallel to that Duration. Add to this,</P>
<P>Secondly, THAT it is so far from being true that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commission was revoked at their return to our <HI>Lord;</HI> that they were then by him furnished with new Powers for the ex∣ercise of tho' Functions it authorised them un∣to. Of this we have an incontestible Proof <HI>Luke</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.18, 19. where we are told, that even after their return from their first Progress, that our <HI>Lord</HI> said unto them, <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Satan as Lightning fall from Heaven, behold I give unto you Power to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on Serpents and Scorpions, and over all the power of the Enemy, and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall by any means hurt you.</HI> I demand therefore to what purpose were
<PB N="14" REF="002510_0014_0FDB64395B29CFC8"/>
these extraordinary Powers conferred, if not to assist them in the Work of their Ministry? for as private Christians they were useless to them, having no direct tendency to promote Faith and Repentance in themselves: The <HI>Remarker</HI> must therefore either go upon this blasphemous Sup∣position, that our <HI>Lord</HI> did in vain bestow upon them these Powers, and for no wise End or Use, or confess to the Truth that they were endowed with them, for the better enabling of them, successfully to discharge the Functions contained in the Commission they had received from him; the Conversion of the World to the Faith and Acknowledgements of their Master, by their Doctrines, attested with Miracles. Nor will it follow here, that because Miracles are ceased, therefore their Commission has likewise: For they are two different Things, Commission or Authority whereby to act, and Extraordina∣ry Gifts whereby to make their acts Successful, and perswade the World that their Commission was Divine; and therefore it must be granted, that the Reason of the one ceasing, and the o∣ther continuing, tho' the one has ceased, the other must continue.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, now I appeal to the com∣mon Sense of Mankind, if the <HI>Remarker</HI> can be said to be in his Senses, when he affirms, that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commission is expired, or that such a <HI>Remark</HI> can be called <HI>Sober,</HI> any more than the Second, That their Commission was limited to <HI>Judeae.</HI> It is owned, that in their first Missi∣on, they were to go unto Places whither our
<PB N="15" REF="002510_0015_0FDB643ADB5880E8"/>
<HI>Lord</HI> himself would come, <HI>Luke</HI> 10.1. But even then not exclusively of others; it is no where said to these Places only, or as it was once to the <HI>Apostles, That they should not turn into the way of the Gentiles,</HI> Matth. 10.5. Nothing of all this, much less is there any restraint laid on them after their return: For as their Work concern∣ed Mankind in general, so must needs their Commission be of universal Extent; and not a Word to be found that confines them to any Place or Nation. But because the <HI>Remarker</HI> can find no such Limitation to the Circumcision in the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commission, his Eyes reel back to the <HI>Apostles</HI> first Commission, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.5. and would argue it from thence, but how unfairly. They were two distinct Commissions, and there∣fore it is all precarious Reasoning from one to the other. Nor will it follow upon the Supposi∣tion, that the <HI>Seventy</HI> were to go out unto the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and that the <HI>Apostles</HI> before they went to them, were to make the first Offers of Sal∣vation unto the <HI>Jews,</HI> that therefore the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commission was more honourable than the <HI>A∣postles,</HI> any more than that the <HI>Remarker,</HI> who, for ought I know, may be a Native of <HI>Britain,</HI> and now upon his pretended <HI>Ministry</HI> in a far distant Country, is more honourable, than that publick Scandal and avowed Enemy to Christi∣anity, that denier and derider of the Divinity of the <HI>Son of God,</HI> his Brother <HI>Pierce,</HI> whose Books and Quotations he is so fond of. No, the <HI>Apostles</HI> had the greatest Honour in beginning their <HI>Mi∣nistry</HI> amongst the once peculiar People of God,
<PB N="16" REF="002510_0016_0FDB643FD16D6918"/>
before they made any tender thereof to those who were Aliens from that Common-Wealth. But since he knows it is denied him, that the <HI>Seventy</HI> were superiour to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> either in Power or Character, he is resolved to bring them upon a level; and since he cannot find, he will make, 82 <HI>Apostles,</HI> by a new Creation of Seventy at a Time; and rather than fail in this attempt, impiously charge the Inspiration <HI>Luke</HI> 10.1. with an Omission, and the Trans∣lators, for not enlisting a Word that was not in the Original, and in spite of both, add the Word <HI>Apostle,</HI> that it may run, as it does in his Head, and be read <HI>Seventy Apostles.</HI> But what would the <HI>Remarker</HI> get by it, if we should allow his fictitious Reading, and false Supposition to be a true one? nothing surely but the ruine of his Cause, by subverting that Foundation where∣upon he designed to erect it, the expiration, of the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commission. For now by his own Confession, and Pleading too, it must be perpe∣tual: For he has freely and frequently allowed, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> Commission, with regard to their ordinary Ministrations in the Word and Sacraments, is perpetual, and to continue to the end of the World: Now if these <HI>Seventy</HI> be <HI>A∣postles,</HI> as he would have us believe, their Com∣mission according to him must continue to the end of the World, and then what has he been disputing about all this while, and contending that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commission is expired; and yet very consistently with himself, that it is not expired, but is to continue to the end of Time,
<PB N="17" REF="002510_0017_0FDB64418D538790"/>
because they were <HI>Apostles.</HI> Or we may observe him Reasoning after this ridiculous manner, as they were <HI>Seventy Disciples,</HI> their Commission is spent and ceased, but as they were <HI>Seventy Apo∣stles,</HI> it will last as long as the World. There is no eviting such Consequences as there will na∣turally flow from this new Hypothesis, which I will allow him the Honour to be the Author and Inventor of, and all his own; and as such I have only argued upon it, for I don't believe the <HI>Seventy</HI> to be a whit the more <HI>Apostles,</HI> for his dubbing them, nor that any of them ascend∣ed to that superiour Order, but as they were ad∣vanced by the immediate call of Heaven, or mediately by a Consecration to the <HI>Apostolate.</HI> Add, that it was the Opinion of the primitive Church, as it is of the best part of the present, that the Helpers and Fellow-Labourers of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> of whom we have frequent Mention in the <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Epistles,</HI> such as <HI>Joseph</HI> called <HI>Barsabas, Mark, Luke, Apollos, Rufus, Niger,</HI> and <HI>Matthias</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> before they were made <HI>Apostles,</HI> were of the Number of the <HI>Seventy.</HI> Who would know the Truth of this, may con∣sult <HI>Euseb.</HI> Lib. 1. Cap. 12.</P>
<P>AND now to sum up the Evidence of this Charge against the <HI>Remarker</HI> upon this second Head, in his denying the continuance of the <HI>Se∣venty</HI>'s Commission, but to make amends in translating them to the <HI>Apostolate,</HI> and all upon his bare Word without any Proof.</P>
<P>IT has, been made appear, that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commission never was formally revoked; and

that the Reasons whereon it was granted conti∣nuing, it must also continue as long as they do, and that again it was so far from being true that it was revoked at their return, that they were furnished with new Powers for the exercise of those Functions it authorised them to; and that moreover it does not appear that their Com∣mission was confined to <HI>Judea,</HI> especially after their first return, and their new Endowments, and that he is guilty of the greatest Profanity in his impious Attempts to add unto the Scripture, and create <HI>Apostles</HI> at his pleasure. It must be granted, that the <HI>Remarks</HI> are so far from being a <HI>sober</HI> Performance, that they are an undeniable Evidence of an intractable Person, incapable of Conviction, and resolved to maintain Paradoxes, I therefore appeal to the World that this is his Case, and in consequence thereof, that he ought to allow <HI>Presbyters</HI> to be Successors to the <HI>Seven∣ty.</HI> since he seem'd to lay the Stress of the Dis∣pute, upon the Point of their Commission being perpetual, and not limitted to the Circumcision.</P>
<P>BUT if he will further wrangle and say, that if we will not grant him that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Com∣mission did determine at their return to our Lord; yet we can't deny but that it expired with themselves, for since according to us, they were meer <HI>Presbyters,</HI> they could not ordain o∣thers, and transmit their Succession; and their Master had left the World but no Power to per∣petuate that Order. Yet however he may like it, we will deny him the Favour even of that Supposition, and affirm and prove it too, that the
<PB N="19" REF="002510_0019_0FDB64448DE1E8C8"/>
Succession to the <HI>Seventy</HI> was continued in the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> who were ordained to that Office by the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and the <HI>Bishops</HI> their Successors, and will be to the end of the World. For the Rea∣son of their Commission continuing beyond their Lives, even to the end of the Harvest, their Commission must also be supposed to do the same, and must actually therefore have been continued, and contained, and confirmed, in the last Commission given to the <HI>Apostles, Matth.</HI> 28.19, 20. <HI>John</HI> 20.21, 22, 23. the higher Or∣der and Power including the two lower Orders and their Powers. For the <HI>Remarker</HI> confesses this to be the Evangelical Charter for the Gos∣pel Ministry. And by this also the <HI>Apostles</HI> first Commission was not only confirmed and conti∣nued, but enlarged with regard to Place, and powers of Government and Ordination. For Mr. <HI>Remarker</HI> acknowledges that this last Com∣mission must be thus interpreted, to include Go∣vernment and Ordination, as well as the Mini∣stry in the Word and Sacraments, Pages 19 and 25.</P>
<P>IF it be asked, What are the Offices of those <HI>Presbyters</HI> we here contend for? I answer, be∣sides preaching and baptizing, the administring the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, and absolv∣ing Penitents.</P>
<P>IF it be further demanded, By what Divine Warrant they are vested with such Offices? I answer, That we are willing to have our Prac∣tice regulated by the primitive Pattern, as we find it in the Scriptures. And</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002510_0020_0FDB644AA46ADC58"/>First, THERE we don't find that ever meet <HI>Deacons</HI> did consecrate the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, or had the Powers of Absolu∣tion. But,</P>
<P>Secondly, WE find that the Brethren that were settled <HI>Presbyters</HI> at <HI>Corinth,</HI> did administer the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11. (For, there was there in Fact, an Administration of that Sacrament, and by Consequence suffici∣ent Powers for it; the Reprehensions there con∣cerning only the irregular Approaches of the Communicants) and did absolve the incestuous Person upon his Repentance, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2 7. For who could absolve, but those who had laid him under Censures by Excommunication? 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.12. And therefore,</P>
<P>Thirdly, THAT it must be <HI>Presbyters</HI> who can affix both Seals of the Covenant to the Pardon, that can absolve Penitents, especially in Cases of Relapses after Baptism, &amp; that can affix one of them; all which Powers are conferred upon and conveyed unto them by the imposition of Epis∣copal Hands. This will be made evident upon my bringing home upon him the fore-mention∣ed Charge, with respect</P>
<P>Thirdly, TO the highest and most venerable Order of Christs Church-Officers, the <HI>Apostolate,</HI> and to which must needs succeed the <HI>Episcopate,</HI> taken in its proper present Sense The <HI>Remarker</HI> has here indeed perplexed the Case, and endea∣voured to <HI>darken Counsel by Words without Know∣ledge,</HI> Job 38.2. But I shall trace his Windings, and fish him out. But to do him Justice, I must
<PB N="21" REF="002510_0021_0FDB644C0E57EFA0"/>
show wherein he yields, and my self, wherein against all Reason, he does not.</P>
<P>BE it known then that, by this own Concessi∣ons, we are upon this Head agreed in these Ar∣ticles.</P>
<P>First, WE agree, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> were ho∣noured with extraordinary Powers and Privi∣ledges, and amongst them, with an unlimitted Jurisdiction over all the Churches, which was to expire with themselves.</P>
<P>Secondly, WE are agreed, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> last Commission, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19 and 20. empow∣ered them and their Successors, not only to the Ministrations of the Word and Sacraments, but to the Government of the Church, and to the Ordination of Ministers.</P>
<P>Thirdly, WE are further agreed, that the Powers of Government and Ordination are an∣nexed.</P>
<P>Fourthly, HE will doubtless grant with me, That in Fact, whatever it may be as to Reason, the Government of <HI>Praelates</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> are two different sorts of Government; that is, the Government of a <HI>Praelate</HI> over a <HI>Diocess,</HI> wherein are many <HI>Presbyters</HI> and Congregations, is not the same with that of a <HI>Presbyter</HI> over a single <HI>Flock.</HI> And I wish we were agreed as well about the</P>
<P>Fifth Point. THE Discussion whereof deter∣mines the Controversy, whereby I affirm, what he denies, That the Power of Ordination was annexed to the Government of <HI>Praelates,</HI> taken in its proper present Ecclesiastical Sense, and not to that Government that meer <HI>Presbyters</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="002510_0022_0FDB644D8DC1F130"/>
have over their single Congregations.</P>
<P>Now there is no other way to be determined in this Point, but by Facts and Precedents upon sacred Record, and the Reason of Things For to run out into wild Excursions, and imperti∣nent: Quotations, (which make up the bulk of the <HI>Remarks,</HI> and whereof if strip'd, there would remain nothing of a real Argument,) is to fall from solid Reasoning, and run wide of the Que∣stion. And I appeal to both these for the Proof of my Assertion, and venture the Cause upon the Arguments formed on them. The clearest and most unexceptionable Facts and Precedents of what kind of Government was annexed to the Power of Ordination, by and after the <HI>Apostles,</HI> upon the sacred Records, are contained in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epistles to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and Christs unto the <HI>Asian Angels, Rev.</HI> 1.20. and Chap 2.1. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I mention St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epistles first, because first wrote. To proceed the more methodically, I shall</P>
<P>First consider the Nature of a <HI>Praelates</HI> Go∣vernment as a <HI>Diocesan Bishop.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, That with such a Government <HI>Ti∣mothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were vested.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That to them vested with such a Government, was committed the Power of Or∣dination.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That the <HI>Asian Angels</HI> were vested with the like Government, and in just Conse∣quence had the Power of Ordination.</P>
<P>Fifthly, That to them vested with such a Go∣vernment, was committed the sole Power of
<PB N="23" REF="002510_0023_0FDB6451EECDEB18"/>
Ordination, exclusive of meer <HI>Presbyters.</HI></P>
<P>Lastly, That the Reason of the Institution of the <HI>Episcopal Order</HI> continuing, it must also be of the same Continuance.</P>
<P>THE clearing these Points, must needs de∣termine the Controversy.</P>
<P>First, LET us consider the Nature of a <HI>Prae∣lates</HI> Government, as he is a <HI>Diocesan Bishop;</HI> and upon enquiry we shall find, that it implied at its first Institution, as it does now, the giving Instructions to those <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> that are within the Verge of his Inspection, con∣cerning their Behaviour, and the exercise of their Offices, the prescribing Rules for a decent and regular Performance of publick Worship, taking care that their Doctrines be Sound and Orthodox, encouraging and promoting those that are faithful and diligent, as on the contra∣ry punishing with Censures or Suspension, the contumacious and disobedient; inspecting also into the Conversations of the People within their Jurisdiction, that they be as becometh their Profession, and if not, being liable to his Judg∣ment and Correction. These are some Instan∣ces of the <HI>Praelatical Government</HI> of a <HI>Diocesan Bishop.</HI> Now let us see,</P>
<P>Secondly, Whether <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were intrusted with such Powers and Authority, and if their Government be found <HI>Praelatical</HI> in these Instances, I hope it will not be denied, that they were in the present proper Sense of the Words, <HI>Diocesan Bishops.</HI> Now that in Fact they were vested with such a Government, will be clear by
<PB N="24" REF="002510_0024_0FDB6452D5136E78"/>
having recourse to the Epistles to them, where Records thereof are preserved. For there we shall find them endowed with these Powers and Charges, to inspect into the <HI>Presbyters</HI> Conduct, and if it be not becoming the Gospel and their Character, they were to censure and suspend <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 19 and 20. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.10. To direct the Method for Divine Worship, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.1—9. To take care that the <HI>Presbyters</HI> preached sound Doctrine, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.3. and rebuke them sharply, and even stop their Mouths if they did not. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.6, 7, and 11. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.9, 10, and 11. And to prefer the deserving, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.13. and Chap. 5.17. And many Rules are given not on∣ly for the Government of their Ministers, but of their Congregations also, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.2—17. Ch. 6.17, 18, and 19. Now these were all proper Acts of a <HI>Praelatical Government,</HI> over several <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> and Congregations, and not over a single <HI>Fleck,</HI> as is here evident from the several Instan∣ces of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Rule over <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and is un∣deniable from <HI>Crete</HI>'s being a place where were many Cities, in every one of which <HI>Presbyters</HI> were to be settled; it will therefore follow, they were <HI>Diocesan Bishops,</HI> in the strict proper present Sense of the Words.</P>
<P>Thirdly, WE are to observe, that to those very Persons thus vested and intrusted with the <HI>praelatical Powers</HI> and Government of <HI>Diocesan Bishops,</HI> was committed the Power of Ordination. It was no other than <HI>Timothy</HI> adorned with all those Signatures of Rule over the <HI>Presbyters</HI> of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> that was to lay on Hands with Caution,
<PB N="25" REF="002510_0025_0FDB64551034DD60"/>
and as he found the Candidates qualified for sa∣cred Services, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.21, 22. It was no other, than this very <HI>Titus,</HI> in whom we have found such legible Characters of a <HI>Diocesan Bishop,</HI> that for this very end was left in <HI>Crete,</HI> to ordain El∣ders in every City, <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.5. And it is to no purpose for the <HI>Remarker</HI> to alledge, that they had those Powers of Government and Ordina∣tion as endowed with extraordinary Powers or Gifts. This is <HI>petitio Principii,</HI> or in his own de∣cent Expression, a mean begging of the Ques∣tion; for as we know, he will hardly believe us, even although we prove, so he may be assured that his <HI>perhaps</HI> and <HI>may be</HI>'s are of no weight with us; for we will never take his Word for any thing he don't make appear. And it is ri∣diculous for him and his Party, who are so Cla∣morous for Scripture Proofs and Examples, for every thing that is to be done about sacred Things or Persons, to go upon bare Suppositi∣ons in Things of the highest Moment. For no∣thing extraordinary either of Powers or Gifts, appears in the whole Case; nothing but what <HI>Diocesan Bishops</HI> with their ordinary Powers may and do ordinarily perform. And it is most un∣just, and against all the Laws of Reasoning, to put us upon the proof of these Negatives, That they had no Assistance, that they did not all this as <HI>Presbyters,</HI> &amp;c. We deny all these groundless Surmises, and therefore the Proof belongs to him the positive Affirmer, which because there is no Ground to go upon, we are assured it can never be done. We are now further for the Confimation of our Point,</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002510_0026_0FDB6456903D8C08"/>Fourthly, TO evince, that the <HI>Asian Angels</HI> were vested with a like Government, and in just Consequence had the Power of Ordination. That they were vested with a <HI>praelatical Govern∣ment</HI> appears from hence, that several of them were threatned and condemned by our Lord, for suffering or not restraining the Doctrines of <HI>Balaam,</HI> the <HI>Nicolaitans</HI> and <HI>Jezebel,</HI> Rev. 2.14, 15. and 20. which plainly implied, that they were vested with a coercive ruling Power over these Churches: For if they were only <HI>senior Pastors</HI> or <HI>Moderators,</HI> as the <HI>Remarker</HI> dotes, how could they be culpable and made criminal for not doing, what was not in their Power to do? For as such they could only give their own pri∣vate Judgement and Vote, but not restrain the Actions, with the Toleration whereof they are charged. So that the <HI>Remarker</HI> must either blas∣phemously feign our Lord to bring an unjust Charge against those <HI>Angels,</HI> accusing them of what they were not guilty, and punishing them for what they could not help, or confess the Truth, that their Accusation and threatned Pu∣nishment was just, because they had not exerted their <HI>praelatical Powers</HI> in censuring and restrain∣ing licentious Doctrines of seducing Teachers, within their several Jurisdictions; and that tho' they were constituted Guardians of the Purity of the Christian Faith, they had been remiss in their Charge, and permitted the Corruption of it, to the Dishonour of its Author, and the Scan∣dal of their own Characters. This is the only good and true Account that can be given of
<PB N="27" REF="002510_0027_0FDB645A404A6AC8"/>
that Matter; as for the <HI>Remarker</HI>'s Dream, that every <HI>Angel</HI> was a Company of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> it is hardly worth while to awake him out of it, by any serious Observation on so remarkable a Fa∣ble. He may with much more Reason allow all the <HI>Presbytery</HI> that ordained <HI>Timothy</HI> to be in St. <HI>Paul,</HI> than all the <HI>Presbyters</HI> that were in the <HI>lesser Asia</HI> to be in seven <HI>Bishops.</HI> But I shall not follow him in his Wild-Goose Chase, but pro∣ceed to observe, That since those <HI>Angels</HI> had committed to them the <HI>praelatical</HI> Power of Go∣vernment, they must also have been vested with the Power of Ordination; for we find these Pow∣ers annexed, as in the foregoing Instances of <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and since it plainly appears they were vested with the Powers of the one, there is no reason to deny them the Power of the other. And by just Consequence in both they were <HI>Diocesan Bishops.</HI> Having then found so many <HI>Prelates</HI> in their <HI>Diocesses,</HI> let us now see whether there were any Coadjutors appointed to assist them in their Ordinations, or to the making them the more valid: And upon a due enquiry we shall find,</P>
<P>Fifthly, THAT to them vested with such Powers of Government, was committed the sole power of Ordination, exclusive of meer <HI>Presby∣ters.</HI> For in Points of so great Consequence, we must go upon certain Facts and Precedents, and not upon meer Conjecture, supported by no Reason; and when nothing of this Nature ap∣pears or is affirmed, it is intolerable Boldneness to conclude it confidently. When St. <HI>Paul</HI> says,
<PB N="28" REF="002510_0028_0FDB645BD7DAEB18"/>
I charge <HI>Thee</HI> to lay Hands, I left <HI>Thee</HI> to ordain, without the least mentioning of <HI>Presbyters</HI> to as∣sist, it must necessarily follow, that the sole pow∣er of Ordination was committed to them only, since we have no Warrant or Precedent for the necessity of <HI>Presbyters</HI> Concurrence, unless it be in that often mis-interpreted Text, <HI>The laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery,</HI> whereby is meant even in the Judgment of those who were not in every thing the greatest Friends to the <HI>Episcopal Order,</HI> the Office which was transferred on <HI>Ti∣mothy,</HI> at his Ordination by St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s own Hands. And therefore what Assurance must it be in meer <HI>Presbyters,</HI> to assume to themselves the greatest Power in the Church, that of Ordina∣tion, and pretending to perform that Action not only without a <HI>Bishop,</HI> but in opposition to him. For neither of which Practices is there any Foundation in the Word of God, or any Exam∣ples of such a Practice there. And now to sum up the Evidence,</P>
<P>IF from Facts and Precedents upon the Di∣vine Records, if it appears that a <HI>Praelatical Go∣vernment of Diocesan Bishops</HI> consists in their Ad∣vancement above, and Rule over <HI>Presbyters</HI> and their Churches, that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> were vested with that Government, that the sole pow∣er of Ordination was committed to them vested with those Powers of Government, that the <HI>Asian Angels</HI> were vested with such a <HI>praelatical Govern∣ment;</HI> and that therefore to them also the sole Power of Ordination was committed exclusive of others the Proposition must be granted, name∣ly,
<PB N="29" REF="002510_0029_0FDB646095CDF478"/>
That the Powers of Ordination was annexed to the Government of <HI>Praelates,</HI> taken in its pre∣sent Ecclesiastical Sense, exclusive of meer <HI>Pres∣byters.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, I argue the Truth of this Proposi∣tion against the <HI>Remarker</HI> from the Reason of Things. He allows the Necessity and Being of <HI>Praelacy</HI> during the Times of Inspiration, before the Canon of the Scripture was finished, and during the Infancy of the Church, and all those Reasons now ceasing, he says, there is no fur∣ther Occasion for it, and that the Church now wants no such Governours, inasmuch as the Af∣fairs of Religion will be as well provided for without them; an Instance whereof is the state of Religion in this Country, as he says. Now if the reverse of all this be the Truth, as it is demonstrable, so then the Necessity of <HI>Praelacy</HI> still continues. And</P>
<P>First, IF there was a Necessity of <HI>Praelacy</HI> in the Times of Inspiration, it is much more Ne∣cessary it should continue, that ceasing: For the infallible Conduct, of the Spirit, was sufficient to guide the Church in all its Duties and Or∣dinances, whereas now there is a necessity for a settled Government and Laws. And it's more than probable, for that very Reason a <HI>Praelacy</HI> was instituted, to keep the World within the proper Bounds of their Duty, and direct their Practice, and their Conscience in more doubt∣ful Cases.</P>
<P>Secondly, THERE is as much if not more Reason for <HI>Praelacy;</HI> to be sure, more clear In∣stances
<PB N="30" REF="002510_0030_0FDB64635A3AA920"/>
of it after, than before the finishing of the Canon of the Scripture. However, the Gos∣pels were writ before the clearest Marks we have of the establishing <HI>Praelacy,</HI> and there is nothing in the Epistles or Revelation that tends to sub∣vert it, but much every way to confirm and establish it. And</P>
<P>Thirdly, AS to the Infancy of the Church, if that be a good Reason for it, it still holds, es∣pecially in this Country, where the Church is in its infant State. But why should it be so ne∣cessary for Infant, and so needless for Adult Christianity? When Persons grow up, they of∣ten grow unruly, and very much want to be kept under Restraint and Government. And</P>
<P>Lastly, AS to Appeals to his own Country, and the state of Religion in it, what could have been brought as a more fragrant Evidence for the Necessity of another kind of Government than what is in it, than the Disorders and Dis∣putes, the Contentions and Confusions that are among them, for want of one to whom the dor∣nier Resort is to be made, and the Hydra of Heresies which ought to be beat down by the Crosier.</P>
<P>ADD therefore the Reason of the Things to the Facts and Precedents we have for <HI>Praelacy,</HI> and upon them both, I think I may venture to appeal to the common Sense of Mankind, for its agreeing to the Truth of the Proposition. I can't pass from this Head, without animadvert∣ing on some Cavils, that the <HI>Remarker</HI> has at two Texts adduced by the <HI>Modest Proof,</HI> for the
<PB N="31" REF="002510_0031_0FDB13B92B117F58"/>
perpetuity of the <HI>Apostolate.</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28. <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.17. He may set his Teeth and grin at the Word <HI>Set</HI> in one of those Texts, yet there is an observable Emphasis on it, as if it denoted the Stability of that Institution in the Divine Inten∣tion. And as to his imperious Demand, By what Laws of Interpretation we construe what follows the three Words first named, (whereby we mean the three Orders we contend for) of Gifts, and the Exercises of them.</P>
<P>I answer, By the acknowledged Laws of in∣terpreting Scripture by Scripture, for as to <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> he himself acknowledges their Continuance, and that the <HI>Apostles</HI> shall conti∣nue as long as the World. The Texts are ex∣press and we have no Account of any other Office of a standing Nature: And therefore all those Designations that are delivered in abstract Words, must be applied to the three Orders which are expressed in concrete Terms.</P>
<P>LET us here again view his Vanity, and ob∣serve him glorying in an imaginary Conquest over those Concessions in the <HI>Modest Proof, That tho' the Apostles were vested with an unlimitted Ju∣risdiction, yet thy only transmitted a limitted one.</HI> But notwithstanding of this, they have true Succes∣sors both in Government and Ordination. For these are Truths, and even reconcileable to our Apprehensions. Suppose a great Prince has se∣veral Sons, and several Principalities, and to each Son he gives a Principality, and all the Power whereby he governed it, certainly each Son succeeds the Father in the whole Power
<PB N="32" REF="002510_0032_0FDB646915CBD198"/>
over his respective Principality, tho' not in the whole of the Power the Father had over all the Principalities. This is the very Case; St. <HI>Paul,</HI> for Instance, and so by a Parity of Reason, the same is to be said of the rest of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> gave his Son <HI>Timothy,</HI> as he calls him, the Govern∣ment of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> as he did <HI>Titus</HI> that of <HI>Crete,</HI> with full Power to govern those Places, as he would do was he present. And now who can deny but that <HI>Timothy</HI> succeeded <HI>Paul</HI> in the whole Power he had over <HI>Ephesus,</HI> tho' not in the whole of the Power he had over all other Churches; and the like of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and all others whom the <HI>Apostles</HI> constituted <HI>Bishops</HI> in their respective <HI>Diocesses.</HI> And has not Mr. <HI>Remarker</HI> acknow∣ledged all this? Yea verily, all the Difference is, that he contends this limitted Jurisdiction should necessarily be contracted to a single <HI>Parish,</HI> whereas we deny that Necessity, and have prov∣ed that it was not thus originally so bounded.</P>
<P>BUT tho' it's thus evident that the Govern∣ment settled by Christ and his <HI>Apostles</HI> in the Church, was founded in an Imparity of Officers, or rather in a proper <HI>Diocesan Episcopacy;</HI> yet since often the Distance is wide between Possession and Right, I don't affirm there is such an inviolable and essential Connection be∣tween the Powers of Ordination and Jurisdicti∣on, that they must always be found in an actual Conjunction. For the Ordinations of a <HI>Bishop</HI> unjustly expelled his See, are good and valid, wherever he is, and to whose Character the Faithful will always every where pay their doe Regards.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="002510_0033_0FDB646A12A164D8"/>NOR do I measure the <HI>Episcopal Power</HI> of Or∣dination by the extent of Jurisdiction, for that Power varies not by Accidents or Circumstan∣ces: And therefore let the <HI>Remarker</HI> make as little Logical a Diocess for a <HI>Bishop</HI> as he can, we cannot admit his <HI>independent Pastor</HI> to usurp it, or sustain so much as the very lowest Office in the Gospel Ministry; and that for the Rea∣son we have been upon, becuuse he has not been ordained by a Successor to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> in whom always according to the original Institution, the powers of Ordination and Jurisdiction over a plurality of <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Churches</HI> either in Fact or Right, that is a capacity or plenitude of Pow∣er for such a Government, are connected; the Fact he disowns, and the Right he disclaims, and therefore from neither can he make any just pretence to a valid Ordination.</P>
<P>I shall now under this second Head subjoin some Defences of the Answers, that were made to the Objections which the <HI>Remarker</HI> and his Party commonly urge against <HI>Episcopacy.</HI> First, as to that of <HI>Acts</HI> 20▪17, and 28. those were cer∣tainly present at that Meeting at <HI>Miletus</HI> with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> among whom he had gone preaching for three Years in <HI>Asia,</HI> and these were undoubt∣edly <HI>Bishops</HI> about, as well as the Elders of the City of <HI>Ephesus</HI> unless we will admit these three Absurdities, First, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> travelled three Years preaching only in <HI>Ephesus,</HI> which who can believe, who considers not only the Im∣propriety of the Expression, but the greatness of his Work, and the extent of his Commission?
<PB N="34" REF="002510_0034_0FDB646F0B374AC8"/>
Secondly, that the Country <HI>Bishops</HI> were so dif∣ficult of access and stiff, that they could not so easily be convened as the <HI>Ephesian Elders;</HI> for the <HI>Remarker</HI> seems to hint such a thing, when he says, The <HI>Apostle</HI> was in hast, and could not wait for them; which who can believe of so good a Man? And Thirdly, That <HI>Timothy,</HI> whom we have proved by all the Marks of a <HI>praelatical Power</HI> to have been a <HI>Bishop,</HI> and whom the <HI>Re∣marker</HI> says was present, was still an <HI>Elder</HI> and no more; and therefore unless we will grant these Absurdities, we must conclude, that there were <HI>Bishops</HI> present as well as <HI>Presbyters.</HI> Secondly, As to <HI>Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> 1.7. as it was necessary that <HI>Titus</HI> at his first Residence in the Island, should ordain Elders in every City, so as the number of Chri∣stians and Congregations in each City increas∣ed, it was necessary he should ordain <HI>Bishops</HI> to preside over the <HI>Presbyters</HI> and Churches that were in each City. For it is most probable that in the dawning of the Gospel, when there were so few of those Lights the <HI>Bishops,</HI> that one <HI>Bi∣shop</HI> not only ordained <HI>Presbyters</HI> but <HI>Prelates</HI> too, tho' Antiquity tells us <HI>Timothy</HI> was a <HI>Metropolitan.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, All this to be replied and applied unto 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.2—7. And however strange the <HI>Remarker</HI> may think that St. <HI>Paul</HI> did not express himself in Language significant to his Apprehen∣sions, it is much more strange that he should fault the Conduct of an inspired <HI>Apostle.</HI> How∣ever for his Satisfaction in this Point, I remit him to St. <HI>Chrys.</HI> whom he will find giving a very good Reason, why there is little said to or of
<PB N="35" REF="002510_0035_0FDB6470D5F20AC0"/>
<HI>Presbyters,</HI> where <HI>Bishops</HI> were present, or men∣tioned, in Hom. 11. on 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. Edit. <HI>Savil.</HI> Tom. 4. P. 289. <HI>A peri Episcopoon eipe tauta kai tois Presbuterois armottei tee gar Cheirotonia monee Uper bebeekasi kai touto monon dioikousi pleonektein tous Presbuterous.</HI> Implying, <HI>That the same Rules giv∣en to</HI> Bishops, <HI>may be applied to</HI> Presbyters, <HI>except∣ing only the Case of Ordination, which was peculiar to</HI> Bishops.</P>
<P>Fourthly, As to <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.1. it is certain that <HI>Philippi</HI> was a chief City of <HI>Macedonia, Acts</HI> 16.12. round which were doubtless a great many Churches and <HI>Bishops,</HI> who might be denomi∣nated from the <HI>Metropolis;</HI> I say doubtless, be∣cause it is past all doubt but that these People were mightily increased in Numbers, and ex∣ceedingly commended for their Piety and Vir∣tues by St. <HI>Paul</HI> in that Epistle, and as the Ex∣igencies of the Churches required, the Gover∣nours unquestionably often met to consult about the common Concerns of Christianity; for they were desired to strive together for the Faith of the Gospel, <HI>v.</HI> 27. And therefore it was no greater a Solocism in St. <HI>Paul,</HI> to write to the <HI>Bishops</HI> at <HI>Philippi,</HI> than it would be to write to the <HI>Bishops</HI> at <HI>London,</HI> in the sitting of the Convo∣cation, tho' we know there is but one <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>London.</HI> And notwithstanding all he has said a∣gainst the Translation offered in the <HI>Modest Proof,</HI> there is nothing in the Original that hin∣ders it being exactly so rendered; unless it be the Cause of <HI>Episcopacy.</HI> The Case indeed may be otherwise where the Original will allow, but the Sense will not suffer the Translation, lest it should suffer.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="002510_0036_0FDB6472B0DF3EE8"/>Fifthly, As to what he trifles about the Iden∣tity of Names, I observe first, That it is certain great Personages are sometimes stiled from the lowest Offices they sustain; and yet it must al∣ways be allowed without any Diminution to their Characters, to which higher Appellations are likewise due. Secondly, That it is a very laudable Attempt in many great Divines (tho' faulted by our <HI>Remarker</HI>) to reconcile their pro∣per Names to their Offices; tho' after different Methods, yet all concurring in the same general Design, of bringing the different Orders to their respective Appellations, according to the Dis∣tinctions we find founded in their Nature Thirdly, That the <HI>Remarker</HI> is resolved to have two of these common and promiscuous Names, as he calls them, and appropriate them to one Office, and like an Ambidexter, with one or o∣ther of them repel the Force of any Argument.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That when a <HI>Bishop</HI> is mentioned, is always understood one of the highest of the sa∣cred Order, who is also a <HI>Presbyter</HI> and <HI>Deacon.</HI> When a <HI>Presbyter</HI> is mentioned, one that is also certainly a <HI>Deacon,</HI> and who may by some pecu∣liar Circumstances appear to be also a <HI>Bishop.</HI> And when a <HI>Deacon</HI> is mentioned, the lowest Order of Church Officers, but by a narrow in∣spection in<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Times and Circumstances, and the Occasions of mentioning him under that Cha∣racter, may be actually at the same time, not only a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> but a <HI>Bishop.</HI> And this for the Identity of Names. Sixthly, As to that of <HI>Matth.</HI> 20.25. it's certain our Saviour's Answer
<PB N="37" REF="002510_0037_0FDB647677416A90"/>
was pertinent to the Petition, and there is no∣thing that appears in either, intended of Church Authority; for the two Apostles imagining that their Master was to be a Temporal Prince, were willing by their maternal Advice and Request, to bespeak Advancement in that Kingdom; and therefore not a <HI>Bishoprick,</HI> but some Principality or secular Dominion. The Argument therefore in this Instance, is wide of the Case and imper∣tinent.</P>
<P>Seventhly, As to 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.23. it's certain, that whatever Defects of Ingenuity or Know∣ledge Mr. <HI>Remarker</HI> discovers, he is sure to make it up in Malice, here insinuating, that the <HI>English Bishops</HI> are consecrated <HI>Lords Bishops,</HI> as Successors in, or Partakers of that Temporal Kingdom the Brethren dreamt of; whereas the Title of <HI>Lords</HI> proceeds only from the Munificence of <HI>Princes,</HI> as the Rewards of the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s Piety and Services, and for the greater Honour and Reverence to their Character; and the Temporalities are be∣stowed for the support of their Dignity, and to enable them for Acts of Charity and Hospitali∣ty; and therefore our <HI>English Bishops</HI> would be equally <HI>Christ's Bishops,</HI> if they were no <HI>Lords</HI> and had no Lands; tho' for the Reasons given, it is just and necessary they should be the one, and have the other, and be treated with Decen∣cy and good Manners.</P>
<P>Lastly, As to 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.14. I am willing to be determined by the Author he has appeal'd unto, whose Words on the Place I shall set down in his own Language, to avoid the In∣sults
<PB N="38" REF="002510_0038_0FDB6477946F9CF8"/>
that have been given on this Occasion, and also the Translation for the sake of those who understand not the Original.</P>

I say his own abused <HI>Calvin,</HI> for that tho' in most things he is on his own side, yet because he had frankly confessed a known Truth, that <HI>Episcopacy</HI> was the primitive Church Government, he brings him in talking this Nonsense, p. 53. Out of the Order of <HI>Elders,</HI> they chose preaching and ruling Elders; whereas there is not a Word of those <HI>Elders</HI> in the Place he refers to, but the three Orders of Ministers which the ancient Church retained, according to the Scriptures. And p. 17. he translates <HI>Secundo loco,</HI> the Time of their Mission. I call upon him therefore to confess, that either he designed to abuse that Gen∣tleman in the Translation, or that he did not un∣derstand his Language, and so could not help it.</P>
<P>He had better let Dr. <HI>Scott</HI> been at rest, for he has raised a Ghost he can never conjure, nor all the <HI>Dissenters</HI> in the World ever answer the <HI>Doctor</HI>'s Argument. For there being only a ceasing of the <HI>Apostles</HI> extraordinary Powers, but no Repeal of the Institution of the Apostolical Order; and the Reasons whereon it was found∣ed manifestly continuing, it can never be allow∣ed to be discontinued, which would also sup∣pose
<PB N="39" REF="002510_0039_0FDB6479DAA64BD0"/>
a violation of the Divine Promise, that it should continue to the end of the World: And all Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI>'s Specialties relate only to the <HI>Apostles</HI> peculiar and extraordinary Gifts and Priviledges; the not observing of which Distinc∣tion, (only when it can serve a turn) is the <HI>Prot<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n pseudos</HI> that runs thro' the <HI>Remarks.</HI></P>
<P>And now I hope what has been said is suffi∣cient to convict him of having this Symptom of Intemperance upon him, That he is tenacious of his Opinions, against the clearest Evidence, and that he affirms and denies any thing at his pleasure, and without any Proof but his bare Word. I proceed to the</P>
<P>Third Charge that he has upon him, that Sign of Intemperance, that he is full of Incon∣sistencies, and not only contradicts others, but himself: And as to the former part, I think I have made it appear, that he has very incon∣sistently with Truth or Manners, contradicted the best and wisest of Men, and that he contra∣dicts himself, since perhaps he will not take my Word, I hope he will take his own, and believe his dear self, when he talks at random after this manner, p. 48. <HI>It can't be proved but that</HI> Timo∣thy <HI>was an itinerant Missionary, having no particu∣lar Relation to the Church of</HI> Ephesus; and then tacks about and denies it all, p. 56. and says, <HI>Timoth<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was to abide at</HI> Ephesus, <HI>Ch</HI> 1.23. <HI>and not to travel from City to City.</HI> I leave him when he is <HI>sober,</HI> to reconcile himself with himself, and go to the</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="002510_0040_0FDB647DEC9183F0"/>Last Sign I mentioned of his being inflamed with Intemperance, and that is his being soon angry, and very quarrelsome without Provoca∣tion; else, why <HI>occasional Perjury?</HI> the modest Gentleman he was snarling at, had said nothing to raise his Choler, unless it was insinuating, that <HI>Monarchy</HI> and <HI>Praelacy</HI> mutually support each other, and that <HI>Schism</HI> and <HI>Sedition</HI> are near a-kin; and I verily believe this was the Case, and he was touched in the tender Part; for neither he nor any of his Party are willing to hear this sad Truth, That <HI>Presbytery</HI> was hardly any where ever established, but on the Ruins of <HI>Kings</HI> or <HI>Kingdoms.</HI> None but an angry Non-con C—b would have given the Name of <HI>prating Coxcomb</HI> to a <HI>Bishop</HI> or <HI>Deacon,</HI> and that meerly because he performs his Office according to the Powers of its Original Institution. And why so angry with <HI>My Lords the Bishops?</HI> Is the Plumb green because it is so high? Sure they ought to be treated with Deference and Distinction, on account of their Titles that are of Regal Creation. But I must quit his Company, lest I also should seem to grow angry at his intolerable Insolencies.</P>
<P>But here perhaps the <HI>Remarker</HI> may alledge, I have mistaken him, and that by <HI>Sobriety</HI> he meant <HI>Modesty</HI> and <HI>Integrity;</HI> I shall therefore re∣present him to you in the Drese of those pre∣tended Characters, that it may be known what right he has to wear them: And I have reserved this View of him to this Place, being unwilling to mingle with the Dispute, what did not ori∣ginally concern it.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="002510_0041_0FDB647F1468A7B8"/>Now if to appeal to the venerable Order of <HI>Bishops</HI> (for so most of them were whom he cites to vouch for him) to condemn their own Pow∣ers, and confess themselves bold Usurpers upon the Rights of <HI>Presbyters</HI> and People, as holding an unlawful Office, by as unwarrantable a Te∣nure; or if to summon Persons of the most un∣suspected Veracity, to affirm as Truth, what they knew to be false, and <HI>e contra;</HI> or if to put them to the Torture to speak against their Knowledge; or if lastly to pervert and wrest their Words to a Meaning, the direct contrary whereof they were designed to express, be <HI>mo∣dest</HI> and <HI>sincere;</HI> then the <HI>Remarker</HI> is the Man he pretends to be; for this is his very Case, and has been his laboured Practice. That herein I do him Justice, I shall produce those Evidences he has had the Modesty to call upon as Witnes∣ses to his Opinion.</P>
<P>First then, let us hear what was the Judg∣ment of <HI>Clemens</HI> Bishop of <HI>Rome</HI> on the Case; he, to show that the Terms whereby the Offices of the Christian Ministry are expressed, had been used of old, cites <HI>Is.</HI> 60.17. in these Words, (but in a different Edition of the Septuagint from what is now in use) <HI>Katastesoo tous Episcopous autoon en dikaiosune Kai tous Diaconous autoon en Pistei.

Cor. Cap 40. <HI>Oxon.</HI> 1677. <HI>The Chief Priests,</HI> says he, <HI>have assigned them their particular Functions, the Priests their proper Places, and the Deacons their peculiar Ministries.</HI></P>
<P>The next is <HI>Policarp,</HI> whom <HI>Eusebius,</HI> Lib. 4. Cap. 14. out of <HI>Iren.</HI> Lib. 3. Cap. 3. tells us, was <HI>Upo Apostoloon en tee Ecclesia en Smurna O Episcopos katastatheis,</HI> Appointed <HI>Bishop</HI> in the Church of <HI>Smyrna</HI> by the <HI>Apostles;</HI> who in his Epistle to the <HI>Philippians,</HI> Sect. 13.

<P>Third is <HI>Jerom,</HI> who in Ep. ad <HI>Ev.</HI> says, <HI>Ut sciamus Traditiones Apostolicas sumptas de veteri Testamento quod Aaron &amp; Filii ejus atquae Levitae fuerunt in Templo, hoc sibi et Episcopi et Presbyteri, et Diaconi vendicant in Ecclesia, That we may know the Apostolical Traditions concerning the Old Testa∣ment, what Aaron and his Sons were in the Temple, the same were Bishops, Presbyters and Deacons in the Church.</HI> Which exactly accords with St. <HI>Clement</HI> above, as he does with him in his Comment on the fore-cited Text of <HI>Isaiah,</HI> and thence infers, <HI>Principes futuros Ecclesiae Episcopos nominavit, the

future Princes of the Church are there called Bi∣shops.</HI> A</P>
<P>Fourth is St. <HI>Augustine,</HI> Bishop of <HI>Hippo,</HI> whose Complement to St. <HI>Jerom</HI> the <HI>Remarker</HI> perverts, mis-translates, and leaves out a part of the Sen∣tence which would explain the whole. The Sen∣tence is in Ep. ad <HI>Hieron. Quanquam secundum honorem vocabulorum quae jam usus obtinuit, Episcopa∣tus Presbyterio major fit, multis tamen in rebus Au∣gustino Hieronymus major est, Altho' Episcopacy be greater than Presbytery, according to the Honour of Words now in use, yet Jerom is greater than Augus∣tine.</HI> Which is only designed as a Commendation of St. <HI>Jerom,</HI> but not a Disparagement to his own Order. But now let us hear himself upon the Point, <HI>in Ep.</HI> 42. <HI>ad</HI> Fratr. Madaur. <HI>Edit.</HI> Basil 1556. <HI>Christiana Societas per sedes Apostolorum, et successiones Episcoporum, certa per Orbem propagatione diffunditur. The Christian Church is spread over the World through the Apostolical Sees, and the succession of Bishops therein.</HI> And of what value this Succes∣sion was with him, we may see <HI>Ep.</HI> 165. where he says, <HI>Si ordo Episcoporum sibi succedentium con∣siderandus est, quanto certius et vero salubriter ab ipso Petro numeramus. If the Order of Bishops succeeding one another be considerable, we take the surest and the safest Way, who reckon from St.</HI> Peter, and then gives a List of the <HI>Roman Bishops;</HI> so that he who was so hearty for a Succession of <HI>Bishops,</HI> was far from being a Witness that there were never any at all. A</P>
<P>Fifth is St. <HI>Ambrose</HI> Bishop of <HI>Millain,</HI> the Commentaries on the Epistles which go under
<PB N="44" REF="002510_0044_0FDB64875AE04790"/>
his Name, say in <HI>Epist. ad</HI> Eph. <HI>Cap.</HI> 4. <HI>Timotheo um a se creatum Presbyterum Episcopum nominat. He calls Timothy a Bishop who had been a Presbyter.</HI> And in <HI>Ep. ad</HI> Tit. <HI>Titum Apostolus consecravit Episcopum, the Apostle consecrated Titus a Bishop.</HI> And nothing can be more express to the Purpose than what he says in <HI>Lib de Dignit. Sacerd. Cap</HI> 3. <HI>Aliud est enim quod ab Episcopo requirit Deus, et aliud quod a Presbytero, et aliud quod a Diacono. God requires one thing of Bishops, another of Presbyters, and another of Deacons.</HI> From whence it follows, that if they were three kinds of Church Officers in his Judgment accountable unto God, that he thought they discharged three distinct Offices.</P>
<P><HI>Sedulius</HI> is of the same Opinion with <HI>Jerom,</HI> whom we have produced on the side of <HI>Episcopa∣cy,</HI> and <HI>Primatius</HI> the same with St. <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> whose Judgment on the Case we have seen. And on 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. he gives the same Reason as <HI>Chrysost.</HI> why <HI>Presbyters</HI> are not named. <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in Episcoporum ordine comprehendit quia secundus,</HI> That Order as next unto it, is comprehended in the Episcopate.</P>
<P><HI>Theodoret</HI> on 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> is so plain for <HI>Bishops</HI> be∣ing the <HI>Apostles</HI> Successors, that he says those who are now called <HI>Bishops,</HI> were at first called <HI>Apostles;</HI> and <HI>Theophilact</HI> in Arg. in Ep. ad <HI>Tit.</HI> Edit. <HI>Loud.</HI> 1636. <HI>O Titos con Episcopos tees K<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee∣tees Magalees, That</HI> Titus <HI>was Bishop of the great</HI> Crete.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Epiphanius</HI>'s Testimony concerning <HI>Aerius,</HI> rather than admit it, the <HI>Remarker</HI> will give him up to the <HI>Papists,</HI> tho' many learned
<PB N="45" REF="002510_0045_0FDB648C0DF5B718"/>
Men have defended him from allowing any more than commemorative Prayers. But supposing him in an Error in one Point, will it follow, that all he says is false? if that be admitted as a Rule, the <HI>Remarker</HI>'s Testimony must never be allowed in any Case; for I appeal to the World, that I have detected him guilty of a great many Errors. But besides this Testimony, we have St. <HI>Aug.</HI> condemning that Heretick, for this very Reason, <HI>Quod asseverat Presbyterum ab Episcopo nulla differentia debere distingui. Aug.</HI> Lib. de Heret. <HI>Because he acknowledged no difference between a Bishop and a Presbyter.</HI></P>
<P>And thus have we the Sense of those Fathers upon the Dispute, whom the <HI>Remarker</HI> has had the modesty to affirm to be on his side of it.</P>
<P>And by the way I would observe, that not∣withstanding his learned Criticism upon the Word <HI>Presbuterion,</HI> that in the Language of the Greek Fathers <HI>Cheirotonia Presbuteriou</HI> stands for the Decree or Order of Presbyterat, as is plain <HI>Euseb.</HI> Lib. 6. Cap. 20. speaking there of <HI>Origen</HI>'s being invited to dispute, tho' he had not as yet obtained the Decree of Presbyterat, expresly there called <HI>Cheirotonian Presbuterion.</HI></P>
<P>But to make a just Improvement on the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣marker</HI>'s pretence to this Virtue, I would sub∣sume, that it amounts to no less than a Demon∣stration, that <HI>Episcopal Government</HI> is of a Divine Original, and that upon these Reasons:</P>
<P>First, That in Fact it being found in the pri∣mitive Church, no Time can be assigned but the <HI>Apostolical</HI> when it begun.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="002510_0046_0FDB648E2DF32B18"/>Secondly, That it was so far from being set up by the secular Power, that it was the Go∣vernment of the Church in the heat of the fiercest Persecutions, wherein the <HI>Bishops</HI> especi∣ally, were in a manner sure of a Crown of Mar∣tyrdom.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That if <HI>Episcopacy</HI> was not coeval with Christianity, it would be a Miracle that at one and the same Instant, the Government of the Church should become universally <HI>prelatical,</HI> for so we find it every where established where Christianity was planted. And</P>
<P>Fourthly, That it would be no less Wonder∣ful, that there should be no Envy or Ambition among any of the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as not to complain and remonstrate against the <HI>Praelates</HI> Encroach∣ments on their Priviledges, before the Heretick <HI>Aerius,</HI> nor any of them have so much Goodness and Resolution, as not to assert their own Au∣thority against those unreasonable Usurpations upon their Powers, had they esteemed them such.</P>
<P>And therefore upon the whole, it must be granted, that whether by Miracles, or (which is most evident) by <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles Episcopacy</HI> was established, it is every way of a Divine Ori∣ginal.</P>
<P>But as if it was not criminal enough to break open the Monuments of Antiquity and bring forth those Reverend Persons to disown their avowed Principles, &amp; deny their kown Practice, he has the Sincerity to apply to others of a later Date, for the same purpose; and even
<PB N="47" REF="002510_0047_0FDB651090A12FD8"/>
where the Fallacies lie more liable to Discovery. Thus he fastens upon Bishop <HI>Jewel,</HI> to extort such Confessions from him as may speak his Sense: St. <HI>Augustine</HI> as quoted by him on this Head, has been already vindicated from his Calumny and Cavils; St. <HI>Jerom</HI> (unfairly cited by him) is brought in by the <HI>Bishop</HI> saying, <HI>Om∣nes tamen Episcopi quicunque sunt, sunt Successores Apostolorum, Apol.</HI> p. 167. <HI>All Bishops whatever are the Apostles Successors.</HI> And giving his own Sense of the matter, and that of the Church he was defending, he says, <HI>Varios in Ecclesia esse Ordines Ministrorum, alios esse Diaconos, alios Presbyteros, a∣lios Episcopos, quibus institutio populi, et Religionis cura et procuratio commissa est, Apol. p.</HI> 25. <HI>Edit.</HI> Lond. 1692. <HI>There are several Orders of Ministers in the Church, some Deacons, some Presbyters, some Bishops, to whom the cure Souls, and the care of Re∣ligion is committed.</HI> Thus Bishop <HI>Jewel.</HI> With the same degrees of Integrity would he impose upon the World in the Instance of Arch-Bishop <HI>Whit∣gift,</HI> who in the place he refers to, only denies the extraordinary Powers of the <HI>Apostles</HI> to be continued; but for what of their Power is con∣tinuing, let us hear himself in his Dispute upon this very Point with <HI>Cartwright,</HI> where he tells him, <HI>Forasmuch as you greatly contemn Authority, and would have all things proved by Scripture, let me hear a Word of the same that doth but intimate these Offices to be temporal; the place it self seemeth to import a continuance of these Functions unto the coming of Christ,</HI> for he saith, <HI>Eph.</HI> 4.11. <HI>He gave some Apostles,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>I am perswaded you cannot shew
<PB N="48" REF="002510_0048_0FDB13DE191FCEF8"/>
any like place which doth so plainly import the abro∣gating of them, as this doth make for their continu∣ance.</HI> A. B. <HI>Whitgift</HI>'s <HI>Defence of the Answer to the Admonition, Tract</HI> 4. <HI>Pages</HI> 229, 230.</P>
<P>He mistakes the Principle Arch-Bishop. <HI>Ban∣croft</HI> went upon, which was, that the <HI>Episcopate</HI> contained in it self the inferiour Orders, and therefore he looked on such as had only <HI>Presby∣terian</HI> Ordination to be meer Lay men, and in this he had Precedents in the extraordinary Ca∣ses of <HI>Ambrose</HI> made Bishop of <HI>Millain,</HI> at the Instance of the <HI>Emperor Valentinian,</HI> and <HI>Nectari∣us</HI> of <HI>Constantinople,</HI> the like Instance of <HI>Theodo∣sius,</HI> without going through the intermediate probational Stations.</P>
<P>Tho' <HI>Henry the Eighth</HI> as an arbitrary Prince obliged the <HI>Bishops</HI> to take out Royal Licenses for the exercise of their Spiritual Authority, yet surely they derived that from no King but Je∣sus: And tho' Arch-Bishop <HI>Cranmer</HI> rather yield∣ed too far to the Humour of that King, tho' for a good End, the better to promote the Refor∣mation, yet Mr. <HI>Strype,</HI> in his Life tells us, <HI>that being askt if a Bishop can make a Priest, replied, We read not that any other not being a Bishop, hath since the beginning of Christ's Church ordained a Priest.</HI></P>
<P>If a perverse Slander be a Sign of Integrity, the <HI>Remarker</HI> has it upon him, in affirming the <HI>Irenicum</HI> to have been wrote by any Bishop of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and as to what is or can be made of it, stands all for nothing, for the reason of this Promise, that when the <HI>Remarker</HI> shall act the ingenuous part of the <HI>Dean</HI> of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s, who by

the <HI>Unreasonableness of Separation,</HI> consuted the <HI>Rector</HI> of <HI>Sutton</HI>'s <HI>Irenicum,</HI> by expressing his Sor∣row for wasting his Time in writing the <HI>Re∣marks,</HI> in the penitential Signals of a publick Retraction, taking some Pains to refute his own Quibbles, and unravel the Sophisms which he studied for disguising the Truth, and deceiving the World, we will never after that charge up∣on him the Disgrace of having been the Author of that scandalous Performance.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Remarker</HI> will read A. B. <HI>Spotswood</HI>'s History of the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> from <HI>p.</HI> 153. to <HI>p.</HI> 160. and <HI>Petries</HI> on the same Subject, from <HI>p.</HI> 232. to <HI>p.</HI> 380. he will find, (contrary to the false Position he has laid down) that the <HI>Scotch</HI> Superintendants had power of Ordination, which they called Admission, of Visitation, Translati∣on, Deposition, holding Diocesan Synods, re∣ceiving Appeals, judging Divorces, injoining Pennance, and in a Word, doing every thing that is properly Episcopal.</P>
<P>And if he will read Father <HI>Paul</HI>'s History of the Council of <HI>Trent,</HI> from <HI>p.</HI> 573. to <HI>p.</HI> 687. he'l find, that the <HI>Pope</HI>'s Legates there used all their Endeavours to overthrow <HI>Episcopacy;</HI> which wicked Design however the <HI>Gallican</HI> Bishops chiefly as strenuously opposed, and maintained <HI>Episcopacy</HI> to be <HI>Jure Divino;</HI> so that had the <HI>Pope</HI> then obtained his Ends, <HI>Presbyterian Govern∣ment</HI> would have been set up in all the Popish Countries and the <HI>Pope</HI> been <HI>Moderator,</HI> and would still if he could, so that in him indeed <HI>Presbytery</HI> has a Patron and a Pillar, and the <HI>Re∣marker</HI>
<PB N="50" REF="002510_0050_0FDB13E526764488"/>
a Friend to his Cause, tho' that is not the only Point wherein they meet.</P>
<P>But finding no Friends a home, the <HI>Remarker</HI> lays aside all his modest Pretences to their Suf∣frages and with an Air of Assurance would look for some Countenance abroad, but for all his Confidence, he needs not be so sanguine to think that he is much in the Favour of any there; for I might produce the most considerable of the fo∣reign Divines, pronouncing solemn Anathemas upon the rebellious Separatists from the <HI>English Episcopal</HI> Communion, and make it appear that they stand condemned Schismaticks by the Judg∣ment of <HI>Calvin, Bezs, Amyrould▪ Claud, Le Blanc,</HI> &amp;c. only in hopes of his becoming a Penitent, I would not increase his Sorrow, by saying now, what they have said upon this Subject.</P>
<P>But one remarkable Testimony is worth our Observation, and our Pains to bring it out to Light, because it has been industriously con∣cealed, and now not very commonly known, and that is of Mr. <HI>David Blondel,</HI> the <HI>Coriphaeus</HI> of all the Parity Men, who having been em∣ployed by the <HI>Westminster Assembly</HI> to write his <HI>Apologia pro Hieronymo,</HI> concludes it in Words to this purpose; <HI>By all that we have said to assert the Rights of the</HI> Presbytery, <HI>we do not intend to in∣validate the ancient and Apostolick Constitution of</HI> Episcopal <HI>Preheminence, but we believe that whereso∣ever it is established conformable to the ancient Canons, it must be carefully preserved, and wheresoever by some heat of Contention or otherwise it has been put down or violated, it ought to be reverently restored.</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="002510_0051_0FDB648F9440F3A8"/>
Which Passage being destructive to his Employ∣ers Design, upon their vehement and restless Im∣portunity, he was prevailed upon to put it out. So prevailing oftentimes is Party Affection and Interest over Truth. Now that this is Fact, we have the Testimony of Dr. <HI>Peter Du Moulin</HI> in his Letter to Dr. <HI>Durell,</HI> to be seen in the last Page of the 4th Vol. of the <HI>Memoirs of Literature,</HI> writ∣ten by Monsieur <HI>La Rocque,</HI> wherein <HI>Du Moulin</HI> says he had the certain Account of this Affair, not only from Primate <HI>Usher,</HI> but from Mr. <HI>Da∣vid Blondel</HI> himself, in a Letter to his Brother.</P>
<P>And now upon the whole of the <HI>Remarkers</HI> pretences to those Characters of Modesty and Integrity, however some may call evil good, yet Vice and Vertue are of unalterable Natures, and it's in vain to vail one with the Appearance of the other; for upon drawing aside the Curtain, the unmasked Spectacle will be seen in its pro∣per Habit. And therefore to finish this Head, it must be granted me, that if he is abandoned to such an insensible State, that he feels no Horror or Relenting at the Injuries and Indigni∣ties he has offered to some of the greatest and best of Men, what all the World besides himself, and such whom Demonstration cannot convince, will allow me, that he has assumed Characters he has no Right in, or any just Claim unto.</P>
<P>I shall conclude, by an Answer to all his cornuted Dilemma's, with the Story of the Man who had the unhappy Dilemma put to him, to kill his Father, abuse his Mother, or be Drunk; whereupon he chose the last, because, as he
<PB N="52" REF="002510_0052_0FDB64910EBD6448"/>
thought, the least of the Evils: And when he was under that Disorder, became guilty of both the other Crimes. If the Story is a Fable, the Moral is plain; that a Person in the <HI>Remarker's</HI> Frame, would be guilty of the most unnatural Parricide, in destroying the Fathers the Bishops, and in spite of all the Ties of Gratitude and filial Reverence, prostitute the Honour of his Mother the Church of <HI>England</HI> to his vile Lusts and Pas∣sions, and expose her to Contempt and Scorn. The Inference therefore is easy, that whoever would avoid being involved in the Guilt of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Effect, must keep at all possible distance from any Advances to the original Cause. For nothing is more certain, than that as soon as any one starts from the Center of Unity, he is liable to be carried round the Circle of Error, until he falls over the Precipice from whence there is no recovery, unless by wise Reflections, assisted by Divine Grace, he is brought to himself, and back again to his first Principles, from whence he unwarrantably receded.</P>

<HEAD>Postscript.</HEAD>
<P>THE Adversaries to the Book I have been defending, offer themselves Evidences of its not being so contemptible a Piece as they would represent it; since with all the Efforts of impotent Malice, they fly from every Quarter to hiss and spit their Venom on it: For as I was concluding my Letter, the Press was deli∣vered of a mis-shapen Production, sprung from the disordered Brain of one <HI>J Dickinson,</HI> who with the same degrees of Assurance, as when Canting from his <HI>Tub,</HI> would commence an Advocate for <HI>Presbyterian Ordination;</HI> proceed∣ing on the Principles peculiar to that Side, equal Pretences to the Modesty and Manners they are equal Strangers to. Tho' it must be owned, these Scribblers have their singular Ta∣lents, and that the <HI>Remarker</HI> as much excels in Craft and Quibble, as the <HI>Defender</HI> does in Vani∣ty and Confidence, and therefore there must be some Difference in dealing with them.</P>
<P>Having then treated the <HI>Remarker</HI> as he de∣serves, I shall now Remark on the <HI>Defender,</HI> with respect to things peculiar to him; and shall not repeat what I have said to the Instances where they fall into the same Ditch, in climbing
<PB N="54" REF="002510_0054_0FDB649412067C98"/>
over the Hedge design'd to keep them out of the Pastoral Charge. For like the Herds of o∣ther Animals, if one breaks loose, all are prone to follow the Tracks of the first Transgressors.</P>
<P>To detect his Fallicies, and prove the Truths he has denied, and illustrate those he has ob∣scured, I shall first animadvert on his <HI>Preface</HI> and <HI>Introduction,</HI> and then on what the bold Pre∣tender lisps on every Head.</P>
<P>The <HI>Preface</HI> gives the Idea of the Man, and discovering his Petulence and Ignorance, plain∣ly snows the narrow View he has, of what Ex∣tent and Order the Mystical Body of Christ has been in all Ages, and is in the present; else how could he have suggested that the Best and Brightest Part of the Catholick Church is an upstart Sect? We will here allow him all the Club of <HI>Socinians, Antinomians, Muggletonians,</HI> and <HI>Deists</HI> in the <HI>English</HI> Nation, joined in a Confe∣deracy with all the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> there, and upon a fair Poll contend, that they all together are not One to Ten, who are hearty and strenuous Assertors of <HI>Episcopacy</HI> there, and that all the <HI>Sectaries</HI> in the World, are not One to Twenty in the Catholick Church, who maintain it in all its Powers and Rights.</P>
<P>And however far Zeal and Charity may be the Objects of those Persons Envy, who are of his Size of thinking, yet we cannot allow it to be an Excess of one, or a Defect in the other, to deny the <HI>English</HI> Separatists the Favour of sorouding themselves under the Covert of Fo∣reign Churches; for the one oppose <HI>Episcopacy,</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="002510_0055_0FDB64959D8C6C30"/>
and the Men of Learning and Conscience in the other condemn them for it. But here with re∣spect to all, the Maxim holds universally true, That if the Premisses are just, Consequences make themselves, which such are to look to as are affected with them. Nor does any thing that is or can be said upon the Subject, Un∣church any <HI>Protestants</HI> who have proper Mini∣sters and Sacraments, neither doth it Unchurch them if they have not, for they never were nor are they now any Parts of the Catholick Church.</P>
<P>The Government will doubtless resent the advancing that seditious Position, that the Do∣ctrines of Passive Obedience and Non Resistance, whereon is founded its own Security, are <HI>Jaco∣bite Principles, and ought to be exploded.</HI></P>
<P>Pass we now to the <HI>Introduction,</HI> a meer jingle of Words, without Sense or Signification, unless in some Strokes, where it was well if they had had none.</P>
<P>I have in my Reply to the <HI>Remarker,</HI> given the Sense of those venerable Persons on the Case, whose Voices the <HI>Defender</HI> has the Assu∣rance to sollicit for him, and shall only add, that the Reason why <HI>Dissenters</HI> are so fond of <HI>Aerius,</HI> seems to be, that he being branded for an <HI>Arian</HI> as well as <HI>Schismatick,</HI> they are willing to pay a Deference to his Opinions in Doctrine, as well as in Discipline.</P>
<P>The Author of the <HI>Modest Proof</HI> would have supposed some difference betwixt <HI>Popery</HI> and <HI>Presbytery,</HI> by alledging, that tho' <HI>Episcopal Rights</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="002510_0056_0FDB649713BB77C8"/>
had deen early usurped upon by the Papal <HI>Hie∣rarchy,</HI> yet that they had not been disputed by the other for 1400 Years together; but this the <HI>Defender</HI> won't grant, but infers that because there were Papal Usurpations on that Order, therefore <HI>Presbyterian Government</HI> was set up at <HI>Rome</HI> before that Period.</P>
<P>But supposing the <HI>Defender</HI> and the <HI>Pope</HI> agreed not only in that Point, but in that of Infallibili∣lity, yet I do not conceive him so incapable of Error, as to have had any Occasion for the Ex∣clamation, <HI>Have I mistaken this Author all this while?</HI> Yet he has; and it is impossible for him, or any that would defend his Principles, not to go on in an endless Mistake; and particularly he errs in the Instances he has brought here of his being infallible.</P>
<P>For however near the Nature of the <HI>Stygian,</HI> the Waters of <HI>Geneva</HI> Lake may be, and how∣ever swift the <HI>Geneva Raven</HI> in its Flight, yet Thanks to the Glorious Head of the Church, it was preserved from being poisoned with their pestiferous Influences: And therefore it will not follow, that there are no real <HI>Bishops</HI> in the Nor∣thern Kingdoms, tho' <HI>Bugenhage</HI> was improved as an Instrument of the Reformation in <HI>Denmark,</HI> where we are assured there are two <HI>Arch-Bishops</HI> and thirteen <HI>Bishops,</HI> any more than that contra∣ry to known Fact and the Truth of History, there were no <HI>Superintendants</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> where <HI>Knox</HI> was improved as a like Instrument.</P>
<P>Having thus accounted for the Truth and Sense of the <HI>Preface</HI> and <HI>Introduction,</HI> let us now
<PB N="57" REF="002510_0057_0FDB649BEF441518"/>
listen to what he lisps from the</P>
<P>First H<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and here he begins with the <HI>Re∣marker</HI>'s Iniquity of adding to the Scriptures, creating <HI>Apostles,</HI> and giving Commissions at pleasure, and therefore let them both stand to the same Correction I have already given that Wickedness. And I shall only further observe, that either some evil Genius must have cull'd out for them both, that Passage of Mr. <HI>Sage,</HI> (whose drift there was to prove a Truth that the <HI>Apostles</HI> had not at the time he was upon, re∣ceived their last Commission for Government) or that they must be judicially hardened, to have read that Book unto that Passage, and not have dropped the Pen out of their trembling Hands, struck with the strength and light of the Argu∣ments, adduced there for <HI>Episcopcy.</HI> But rather than yield that the <HI>Seventy</HI>'s Commission was continued after their first return, they will re∣nounce their own Friends, and deny Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> to be their Oracle, who in <HI>Luke</HI> 10.19. says, <HI>He repeated, ratified and enlarged their Commission.</HI></P>
<P>But under this Head there are some Strokes peculiar to the <HI>Defender,</HI> which must not escape their just Rebukes; as that the <HI>Apostles</HI> were no Gospel Ministers, while blest with their Master's Presence upon Earth, and that in that Interval there was no Gospel Church. Upon this Point I desire a Resolution of these <HI>Queries;</HI> Might not Believers in the Messiah the Lamb of God come to take away the Sins of the World, especially when baptized in that Faith, be accounted Mem∣bers of the Gospel Church? and was our Savi∣our's
<PB N="58" REF="002510_0058_0FDB649E9170C090"/>
Ministry so unsuccessful, as to gain no Converts to the Faith of this Article? Were not those who in so many Words are said, <HI>Luke</HI> 9.6. to have went through the Towns preach∣ing the Gospel, Ministers of the Gospel? And is the Doctrine of the Resurrection the only Ar∣ticle of the Christian Faith? If the <HI>Defender</HI> an∣swers consistently with the Principle he here ad∣vances, he must be concluded to be far removed from, and preach another Gospel than that of Christ.</P>
<P>Another grand Mistake he here labours un∣der, is with respect to the <HI>Deacons</HI> Office, part of which, it is readily granted, was their being charged with the Church Stock, and the care of the Poor; but here he strains the Point unto so high a Pin, that he would have it to be the on∣ly thing they were ordained to, and for this purpose would feign these Suppositions.</P>
<P>First, That the primitive Church was so im∣mensly Rich in respect to what it is at present, that there was a necessity there should be or∣dained Treasurers for the Charge of their Wealth, tho' according to him, the Church Stock is since fallen so low, that there is no Occasion now for those ordained Officers, page 13.</P>
<P>Secondly, That they had their Lazarettos and Hospitals, where the Poor were set at Tables, and whereat these Treasurers were to serve.</P>
<P>Now that there is no just Foundation for these Fancies, will appear from these Reflections.</P>
<P>First, Tho' some sold their Possessions for the good of the Community, yet it's plain the chief
<PB N="59" REF="002510_0059_0FDB64A0104F4EE8"/>
Support of their Poor, was from Collections among the Churches, who, according to their Abilities, ministred to each others Necessities. But what were they to the Riches and Reve∣nues of the Churches every where at present? And even in the Meetings in this Country, large Sums are often collected, under the Colour of charitable Uses; so that if there was Reason to have Officers ordained for the Charge of them <HI>then,</HI> it must be owned there is much more Rea∣son <HI>now.</HI> But,</P>
<P>Secondly, What a groundless Fancy is it, that in the wandring persecuted State of the Church, there should be such Attendance given to the Poor at Tables, and that by ordained Ministers? But the <HI>Defender</HI> seems utterly ignorant of the Nature of those Tables, which were such where the Eucharist was celebrated; and for his In∣struction, I refer him to the Opinion of the An∣cients concerning the <HI>Deacons</HI> Office about them. Thus <HI>Just. Mars.</HI> Apol. 2. p. 92. <HI>Oikonomos Eu∣charistei Diakonos didoasis ekastoo toon parontoon me∣talabein.</HI> The Master consecrates, and the <HI>Dea∣cons</HI> distributes to those that are present. Thus <HI>Ignat.</HI> Ep. ad <HI>Trall.</HI> p. 48. Edit. <HI>Voss. Ou gar broomatoon kai potoon eisi Diakonoi all Eccleesiai Theou uperetai.</HI> They are not <HI>Deacons</HI> of Meat and Drink, but Ministers of the Church of God. And there∣fore here we are to observe, what I have made appear in dealing with the <HI>Remarker,</HI> that besides these lower Offices of the care of the Churches Stock and Poor, and Attendance upon the Eu∣charistical Tables, they were ordained for the
<PB N="60" REF="002510_0060_0FDB64A4602585D0"/>
Superior, of preaching and baptizing. Nor will the <HI>Defender</HI>'s shift, here avail him, that the <HI>Dea∣cons</HI> preached as <HI>Evangelists,</HI> for that is a plain Tautology, and no more than they preached as Preachers, <HI>Evangelist</HI> being the <HI>Greek</HI> of the <HI>Eng∣lish Gospeller,</HI> and both mean a preacher of the Gospel. So that if the <HI>Defender</HI> would speak Sense, he must say, they evangelized or preach∣ed as <HI>Deacons.</HI> Tired theerefore with these lisps, let us hearken to what is uttered from the</P>
<P>Second Head, From <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Defender</HI> breaths nothing but the Vanity and Vapours of an empty, Skull, for the Defence of which, from being crackt, (if it is not so already) he will have occasion now to <HI>hold up his Shield;</HI> for by his Mr. <HI>Hereboord</HI>'s leave, one of the meanest of the Tribe of <HI>Praelatists,</HI> will undertake to an∣swer his Herculean Argument by another <HI>ad Ho∣minem,</HI> tho' it equally affects all the Parity Tribe.</P>
<P>They are bold and insolent Intruders into the Inclosure wherewith our Lord has fenced his Vineyard, who usurp the Ministerial Function without being ordained to it by a Successor to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> in whom, by the original Charter, the Powers of Ordination and Jurisdiction over a plurality of <HI>Presbyters</HI> in Churches, are annex∣ed either in Fact or Right, as I have explained these Words in my Reply to the <HI>Remarks;</HI> but <HI>Jonathan Dickinson</HI> was never ordained by any such Successor.</P>
<P>Ergo, <HI>Jonathan Dickinson</HI> is a bold and inso∣lent intruder, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and no Minister of the Gos∣pel at <HI>Elizabeth-Town;</HI> and therefore in the
<PB N="61" REF="002510_0061_0FDB64A785AA7080"/>
mentioned Reply he will find a full Answer to his Sophism, which supposes, that there is but one single Office contained in the Commission, and one single Part of the Gospel Ministry. For there I have made it appear, that by the Expla∣nations given of that Commission, by the Prac∣tice of those who acted by it, and who being under the infallible Direction of the Spirit, un∣derstood it fully; that there were several things contained in it, and several Offices warranted by it, as the Powers of Preaching, administring the Sacraments, Ordination, and Government, by proper Officers, and that tho' all that discharged any of those Functions, acted by virtue of this Commission, yet that all were not authorized thereby, to do all that was contained therein, and I instanced that <HI>Deacons</HI> by virtue thereof, did preach and baptize, but not consecrate the Lord's Supper, nor meddle with the Powers of Absolution and Censures, which <HI>Presbyters</HI> did; but not Ordain, because not vested witht the Episcopal Powers of Ordination and Jurisdicti∣on</P>
<P>So that there being several Parts of the Gospel Ministry to be discharged by several Officers, his Argument is lost, and is no more than they that are authorized by the same Commission, to the exercise of the same Parts of the Gospel Ministry, have the same Office and Authority: But now for want of a Minor, there is no Con∣clusion, and so the frightful Spectre vanishes. But yet after this vain fit is over, we may ob∣serve him coming into Concessions enough to
<PB N="62" REF="002510_0062_0FDB64A865F479F8"/>
give up the Cause, or Contradictinos enough to overthrow it. For he confesses that our Lord did maintain the Symmetry and Proportion, be∣tween the Jewish Synagogue and the Christian Church; and he has brought in Dr. <HI>Burnet</HI> tel∣ling us, who were the Officers there, a <HI>Bishop, Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons;</HI> from whence it necessari∣ly follows, according unto him, that those Offi∣cers are to be continued in the Christian Church. And here he has given us the very thing we contend for. For by <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Government he doubtless means a Government that ought to be, and he says that having <HI>Bishops, Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> is an exact Description of this Govern∣ment, which is all we plead for; and therefore we are only now to agree upon the Propriety of the Name, which after so free Concessions, he will not surely be so ill natured, as to deny to be Episcopal; since so excellent a Government ought to be denominated from its most excel∣lent Title.</P>
<P>In my Reasoning with the <HI>Remarker,</HI> I have fully replied to what the <HI>Defender</HI> has offered un∣der the <HI>Third Head,</HI> tho' he has here one pecu∣liar Stroke, in denying St. <HI>Paul</HI> the Honour of being an <HI>Apostle,</HI> for before his Conversion he had not seen our Lord, and the <HI>Defender</HI> expresly says, none could be admitted into the <HI>Apostolate,</HI> but such as had seen <HI>Jesus</HI> before his Death. He indeed afterwards owns him as an <HI>Apostle,</HI> but that however, involves him in a Contradiction Proceed we now to what he says from the</P>
<P>Fourth Head, And since this chiefly relates to
<PB N="63" REF="002510_0063_0FDB64AC8DA846E0"/>
Facts, I must clear them from his Misrepresen∣tations; for doing this I shall appeal to Scrip∣ture, Reason, and Authorities. The Instances are chiefly of <HI>James</HI> Bishop of <HI>Jerusalem, Timothy</HI> Bishop of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> as <HI>Titus</HI> of <HI>Crete,</HI> and the <HI>An∣gels</HI> or <HI>Bishops</HI> of <HI>the seven Churches in the lesser Asia;</HI> as for <HI>Matthias,</HI> it's granted his Call to the <HI>Apostolate</HI> was immediate, tho' probably his Con∣secration to it, was by the <HI>Apostles;</HI> and still the Probability advances in the <HI>Apostle Barnabas,</HI> whose Call does not appear to have been imme∣diate.</P>
<P>To begin therefore with <HI>James,</HI> there are just Grounds from Scripture, as well as Authorities from the Ancients, to conclude for his being a∣bove twenty Years resident <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> for when St. <HI>Paul,</HI> three Years after his Con∣version, went to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> he found none other of the <HI>Apostles</HI> there, save <HI>James,</HI> Gal. 1.18, 19. And St. <HI>Jerom</HI> says, in Loc. <HI>Hic autem</HI> Jacobus <HI>Episcopus Hierosolymorum primus fuit cognominatus Justus.</HI> This <HI>James,</HI> Sir-named the Just, was the first <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Eleven Years after this, or fourteen after his Conversion, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.1. St. <HI>Paul</HI> goes again to the General Council held at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> whereof we have an Account, <HI>Acts</HI> 15. and where, after hearing the Case brought before it, this <HI>James</HI> decides the Controversy, <HI>v.</HI> 20. And St <HI>Chrysost.</HI> in Loc. gives the Reason, <HI>Episcopos een tees en Jerosolumon Eccleesias.</HI> He was then Bishop of the Church in <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> Nine Years after this St. <HI>Paul</HI> goes again, the last time he was at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> computed to be <HI>Anno Dom.</HI>
<PB N="64" REF="002510_0064_0FDB64AE4DB89E78"/>
58. and finds <HI>James</HI> still there, <HI>Acts</HI> 21.18. And <HI>Chrysost.</HI> in Loc. repeats what he had said before, and in Hom. in <HI>Ev. Johan.</HI> he says, <HI>Oti Jacobos ton Thronon elabe toon Jerosolumoon</HI> That <HI>James</HI> had his Throne at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> And <HI>Eusch.</HI> L. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> C. 14. <HI>Prooton tees en Jerosolumois Ecclesias ton tees Episcopees encheiristheenai Thronon.</HI> That he was the first who held his Episcopal Throne at <HI>Je∣rusalem.</HI> All which, I hope, will amount to a Rational Evidence, with any but the <HI>Defender</HI> and his Associates, that <HI>James</HI> was <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Je∣rusalem.</HI></P>
<P>Come we now to the Instance of <HI>Timothy,</HI> whom the busy Mocker had almost men ioned under the Stile of a <HI>Primate.</HI> If the Sting in the Tail be not Devil, be that as it is, he thereby designed a <HI>Hail King,</HI> and to treat that venerable Character, with an Air of Impiety, and the flouting Sneer of a Scorner; for nothing incen∣ses them more, than the flaming Evidences that are produced of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s being vested with pre∣latical Powers, and therefore I shall now take off the Exceptions he has seign'd against them.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P>First, Will it follow, that because <HI>Timothy</HI> had been with <HI>Paul</HI> in several Places, that he was not afterwards settled at <HI>Ephesus?</HI> when the Words he ironically cites, do plainly prove he was, any more, than because <HI>Jonathan Dickinson</HI> has been sometimes at a schismatical Seminary, and other Places, that therefore he is not now settled a pretended Pastor, at <HI>Elizabeth-Town,</HI></P>
<P>Nor,</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="002510_0065_0FDB64B03536E8D8"/>Secondly, Is there any more Evidence from <HI>Acts</HI> 20.25. of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s not being <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>E∣phesus,</HI> than there is from thence, of <HI>Jonathan Dickinson</HI>'s not being the <HI>Defender</HI> of <HI>Presbyterian Ordination?</HI> And,</P>
<P>Thirdly, I believe <HI>Jonathan</HI> would look on any one of his Brethren with a jealous Eye, who should offer at the exerting any prelatical Pow∣ers, in censuring his Manners, (for which by the way, there are just Grounds for some others to do it) or charging him with unsound Doc∣trines, (which indeed don't seem very Orthodox) and that he would ask the Question, <HI>Who made thee a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly, It's plain, if <HI>Jonathan</HI> can't pray better than he pleads, tho' it even be a very bad Cause, he has great need of a <HI>Common Prayer</HI> Book, as an Instrument under the Conduct of the Spirit, to help his Infirmities.</P>
<P>Fifthly, All Commissions are exclusive of all but those to whom they are granted; to con∣vince M. A. <HI>Jonathan</HI> of this, suppose his <HI>Deacon Tom</HI> should step up into his Stall, and alledge, that M. A. <HI>Jonathan</HI>'s <HI>Ordainers,</HI> did not by Name, exclude him form the Pastor's Office, and that he thought it a Duty upon Occasion, to exhort and teach; I suppose M. A. <HI>Jonathan,</HI> for the recovery of his Desk, would soon reply, Tho' you was not excluded by Name, yet you was by the Nature of Commissions, which exclude all to whom they are not given; and tho' as a Christian and a Parent, you may privately ex∣hort your Neighbours, and teach your Children,
<PB N="66" REF="002510_0066_0FDB64B1527C8F28"/>
yet preaching in the proper Sense, is the pecu∣liar Duty of Gospel Ministers.</P>
<P>Lastly, All Accusations are not slanderous and evil Reports, for I have brought some very true and just ones against the <HI>Defender,</HI> and such as it is the Prerogative of <HI>Bishops</HI> to take Notice of, and punish such Persons of evil Report, as it was of <HI>Timothy,</HI> not as an <HI>Evangelist,</HI> and so an extraordinary Person, as he dreams: For the <HI>Defender</HI> pretends to be an <HI>Evangelist,</HI> or Preach∣er, and I am well assured, he is no extraordina∣ry Person, unless it be for Impertinence and Pre∣sumption.</P>
<P>The next Instance is <HI>Titus,</HI> whom the <HI>Defen∣der,</HI> upo his bare Word, desires us to believe ne∣ver returned to his See, after his Journey to St. <HI>Paul;</HI> but he has so often falsified his Word, that we can't but disbelieve every thing he says: However, he has not here been carried on with his usual Assurance, to deny what we plead for, that <HI>Titus</HI> discharged the Episcopal Office, while he was at <HI>Crete.</HI></P>
<P>We are at last come to the Company of <HI>An∣gels,</HI> at the sight of whom the <HI>Defender</HI>'s Head is filled with Apocaliptick Visions, which want a new Revelation to explain them, and would from them infer, that because sometimes the Dis∣courses in <HI>Rev.</HI> 2. respect those <HI>Angels</HI> and their Churches, therefore they must always do so; and gives this as the only Reason for it, because the plural Number is sometimes used there: Now if this be a good Argument, I have ten to one of such against him, where the singular
<PB N="67" REF="002510_0067_0FDB64B6AA83B290"/>
Number is used ten times to once of the Plural, and therefore however great a piece of Wit and Gallantry he may esteem his prophane Ribaldry on that Chapter, an Atheist of an equal Talent with him at burlesquing Scripture, has much more room to reply upon him, from the other Number. However, it's plain the <HI>Defender</HI> is an utter Stranger to the Idiom of Scripture Lan∣guage, where an Anallagy of Numbers is obser∣vable, as 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.15. <HI>She shall be saved in Child-bearing, if they continue in the Faith.</HI> In treating with the <HI>Remarker</HI> on this Point, I have accoun∣ted for the Sense of the Word <HI>Angel,</HI> and that I have justly done it, I have the Concurrent O∣pinions of ancient and modern Divines, thus <HI>Aug.</HI> Ep. 162. <HI>Divina voce sub Angeli nomine lau∣datur praepositus Ecclesiae.</HI> The Governour of the Church is praised by the Voice of God, under the Name of an Angel. Thus <HI>Occumen.</HI> in Cap. 2. Apoc. <HI>Asteras de tous Angelous tous toon Ecclee∣sioon ephorous kalei.</HI> He calleth these <HI>Angels</HI> Go∣vernours of the Church <HI>Stars.</HI> And for the Mo∣derns, <HI>Bullinger</HI> Conc. 6. in <HI>Apoc. Angeli sunt legati Dei, Pastores Ecclesiarum.</HI> The <HI>Angels</HI> are the Mes∣sengers of God, the Pastors of the Churches. And he says of <HI>Polycarp,</HI> one of those <HI>Angels, Or∣dinatus ab Apostolis ab ipso tanquam Johanne Epis∣copo.</HI> That he was ordained by the <HI>Apostles,</HI> even by <HI>John</HI> himself. <HI>Paraeus</HI> in Loc. says, <HI>Eosdem An∣gelos vocat quia sunt legati Dei ad Ecclesiam.</HI> They are called <HI>Angels,</HI> because they are Ambassadors of God to his Church. And he is very industri∣ous to find out the very Persons who were those
<PB N="68" REF="002510_0068_0FDB64B8D3714B80"/>
<HI>Angels</HI> or <HI>Bishops.</HI> Nay <HI>Beza,</HI> Annot. Cap. 2. 1 <HI>Apoc.</HI> says, <HI>Angelo</HI> Proestoti <HI>quem nimirum oportuit in primus de his rebus admoneri.</HI> To the <HI>Angel</HI> that is the <HI>President,</HI> who must first have Notice of this Charge. And it's worth observing, that Mr. <HI>Brightman,</HI> the Inventer of the <HI>Defender</HI>'s Fable, founded it upon the single Particle <HI>Kai</HI> in Verse 24. which is wanting in the most ancient Greek Copies of the New Testament.</P>
<P>And thus for the Episcopal Instances, that still do, and ever will stand impregnable, against all the Attacks that are made upon them by saw∣cy puny Scriblers.</P>
<P>We are now to enter upon a new Logical, I wish I could say, Rational Scene; where by Mood and Figure, the <HI>Defender</HI> would argue all the Gospel Ministry out of the World. But pre∣vious to the Enquiry into the Nature of his <HI>Pa∣ralogisms.</HI> we are to observe, that a Word got into his Head, which he could not get rid of, and therefore without knowing its Meaning, sets it down several times in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and that is the Word <HI>Co-ordinate,</HI> which means Equality, and not Identity; so that he has more Powers than he thought of; for if he is <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter,</HI> and they are <HI>Co-ordinate,</HI> he has two distinct Powers, tho' according to him, equal, and thus tho' all his Powers are <HI>Co-ordinate</HI> to his Brethren's, yet they are not numerically the same; the Powers he has are not the indivual Powers ano∣ther has, tho' they may be equal or <HI>Co-ordinate.</HI></P>
<P>Having remarkt this Blunder, I am further to observe, that in my Reply to the <HI>Remarks,</HI> I
<PB N="69" REF="002510_0069_0FDB64BD11F84BC8"/>
have accounted for the Community of Names mentioned in the Arguments, and how to ap∣propriate them, and thither I refer him. It remains therefore, that I demonstrate, that by his way of Reasoning, he has gratified the <HI>En∣thusiasis</HI> and <HI>Libertines,</HI> in that by his Craft, he would clear the World of <HI>Priests.</HI> In order to this, I must set down some Positions, which he has either expresly granted, or must confess to.</P>
<P>First, He affirms it to be just arguing from a Community of Names, to a Co-ordination of Powers; that is, if he means any thing, that he who has any, or all of those Names, is the same Officer, under all or any of those different De∣signations.</P>
<P>Secondly, He will doubtless grant, but in Case he should not, since he has not mentioned them with the other Names, I shall prove, that <HI>Deacon</HI> is a Name of a Gospel Minister. Thus 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.6. <HI>Col.</HI> 4.7.17. 1 <HI>Thess.</HI> 3.2. the Words Mi∣nister or Ministry, are in the Original <HI>Deacon,</HI> or <HI>Deaconship.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, Page thirteenth he gives the Reason why <HI>Deacons</HI> are not now ordained, and that for want of Church Stock; tho' I think he don't want a sort.</P>
<P>Now from these Positions, I will, by his way of Reasoning, prove upon him these two things.</P>
<P>First, That there is a Church-Stock at <HI>Eliza∣beth-Town,</HI> and that he is responsible for it, as he pretends to be the <HI>Deacon</HI> there.</P>
<P>Secondly, That to relieve him from his fear of Refunding, I will by the same way of Rea∣soning
<PB N="70" REF="002510_0070_0FDB64BE0D564A98"/>
prove, that he is no <HI>Deacon</HI> there, nor any where else, nor a Minister of the Gospel at all, and so not at the Place he pretends to be.</P>
<P>First, By his way of Reasoning, I prove there is a Church-Stock at <HI>Elizabeth-Town,</HI> and that he is responsible for it, as he pretends to be <HI>Dea∣con</HI> there: Thus by his way of arguing,</P>
<P><HI>Bishops, Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> are a Communi∣ty of Names for Gospel Ministers, from whence it's just to argue, a Co-ordination of Powers. I suppose he means an Identity of Offices, if he has any meaning.</P>
<P>But <HI>Jonathan Dickinson</HI> says, that the Commu∣nity of Names with their <HI>Co-ordinate</HI> Powers, that is an Identity of Offices, if his Words have any Signification, are applicable to him:</P>
<P><HI>Ergo, Jonathan Dickinson</HI> is a Gospel Minister in all its Offices. Again,</P>
<P><HI>Deacons</HI> were ordained to the Care of the Church-Stock, where there was enough to be taken care of.</P>
<P>But <HI>Jonathan Dickinson</HI> was ordained to the Office of a <HI>Deacon,</HI> that being one of the com∣mon Names of a Gospel Minister.</P>
<P><HI>Ergo, Jonathan Dickinson</HI> is chargeable with the Churches Stock, which he must answer for.</P>
<P>But lest as an Insolvent he should think of running, I will relieve him under that Appre∣hension, and by his way of Reasoning prove, that he had nothing to do with their Stock nor Church, and that he is no Minister of the Gos∣pel at all. Thus,</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="002510_0071_0FDB64BFA32B0D40"/><HI>Deacon</HI> is one of the common Names of Gos∣pel Ministers.</P>
<P>But <HI>Jonathan Dickinson</HI> for want of Church-Stock, was not ordained <HI>Deacon.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI> Is no Gospel Minister, nor has any thing to do with Church or Stock.</P>
<P>And this Rule of Reasoning will universally hold with respect to all the Gospel Ministry, which <HI>Jonathan Dickinson</HI> has now syllogized out of the World, by his ridiculous arguing from a Community of Names, to an Identity of Offi∣ces; which he falsly calls a <HI>Co-ordination</HI> of Powers.</P>
<P>And now at last we are come to his Expostu∣latory Conclusion, wherein he sums up his idle Tales with the same Appeals to Belief, as if he was vending them to his credulous Audience; but what little regard they deserve, I appeal to the World in the following Particulars.</P>
<P>First, The most observing Part of Mankind, must and do grant, that the Contempt where∣with the <HI>Dissenters</HI> have treated the Episcopal Character, and Sacerdotal Powers, has given Occasion to the <HI>Libertine</HI> to call in Question the Truth of all revealed Religion; and to conclude that <HI>Priests</HI> of all Religions were the same, and no Truth in any.</P>
<P>Secondly, That as the <HI>Papists</HI> first encouraged the <HI>English</HI> Conventicles, by sending their gifted <HI>Emissaries</HI> to hold forth amongst them; so have they always promoted these Separations, with a Design to divide and weaken the <HI>Church of Eng∣land,</HI> the chiefest Bulwark in Christendom a∣gainst
<PB N="72" REF="002510_0072_0FDB64C110632508"/>
<HI>Popery,</HI> well knowing, that their <HI>Idolatry</HI> can never be introduced, but at the Breaches made on that Church, by <HI>Schism.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly, That it is a very daring Assurance in the <HI>Defender,</HI> whereby he would dive into the Political Reasons of State, whereby <HI>Presbytery</HI> is established in <HI>North,</HI> as well as tolerated in <HI>South Britain.</HI> I hope he won't affirm it has ever been determined, by the Legislature, that it is a <HI>Jure Divino</HI> Government: Nay, the contrary seems to be, and doubtless is, the fixed Opinion of the Legislature. For the King and the Officers of his Government are Members of the <HI>Church of Eng∣land,</HI> and under the strongest, the most solemn and sacred Engagements so to be; so that what∣ever Insults are offered, by the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> to the Church, are direct Affronts upon the Legisla∣ture, and their Sentiments of Things of the highest Consequence, and is no less than to call in Question, whether they be Members of a Church from which a Separation is groundless, and which with their usual Modesty and Duty they deny; and the Members of the Church, with a becoming Behaviour, and the strongest Evidence, maintain and prove.</P>
<P>Fourthly, That it is in the <HI>Dissenters</HI> own power, to put in Tune the jarring String, they are always harping on, and whence yet they say they can't bear the displeasing Sound of un∣churching <HI>Protestants.</HI> It has been already hinted, that nothing that can be said, doth Unchurch any that have true Pastors and Sacraments, and that those who have not, are not organized
<PB N="73" REF="002510_0073_0FDB64C48853DDD0"/>
Parts of the Mystical Body of Christ; for whe∣ther they will own it or no, these things are clear and demonstrably true.</P>
<P>First, That the Notes of a true Church, are the Orthodox preaching of the Word, and the regular Administrations of the Sacraments, by Persons fully authorized for those Functions.</P>
<P>Secondly, That from the Holy Scripiures, we are to learn what Doctrines are Orthodox, what the Nature of Sacraments, and also (there being now no immediate Mission from Heaven) what the Powers of Preachers and Administrators, and who are vested with them.</P>
<P>And since it is the last of those that has been now under Consideration, I appeal to the un∣biassed and disinterested Part of Mankind, who they are who appear to have the true and only Title to those Powers.</P>
<P>From all which the Inference is natural, that it as much concerns every one as his Salvation amounts to, to be well assured that he is within the Pale of the true Church, and sits under the Means of Grace, and that at the great Audit, he shall be owned by Christ, to have been a Mem∣ber of his Mystical Body upon Earth.</P>

<P>I Received the two Pamphlets you sent me, and your Desire that I would make such Observations on them, as may be of Service to the Publick; tho' I am willing to undergo any tolerable Difficulties, for the preventing or re∣moving Mistakes, yet I abhor dealing in Scan∣dal, and find a strong Reluctance in encounter∣ing a dirty <HI>Scoundrel,</HI> such as the Paradox maker, who seems possessed with one of the Furies of

FORTY ONE, breathing the true Spirit of the Party, and that Day. His Jargon being indeed a Compound of Bombast and Billingsgate. He has told us how he came by his Pedantry, in the Collegians handing him Books he knew not the Use of, and we can account for his Orato∣ry, from the Scurrility of his Temper, the Na∣ture of his Principles, and the Manner of his Education: So that he writing neither like a Scholar nor a Gentleman, he and nine Tenths of his Reveries, are properly to he answered by one equipped in a Porter's Armour, namely his Language and his Club.</P>
<P>But lest, by what remains, he should impose on such as can Reason at no better rate than himself; I shall, overlooking all his Rant and Ribaldry, apply my self only to the exposing the Falshoods he would advance, with respect to Episcopal Succession; the maintaining where∣of is the sum of the Book, he has the Assurance to write against: And then take hold on the Impartial Hand that writes the <HI>Appendix to the Sober Remarks.</HI></P>
<P>In replying to whatever has the Face of Ar∣gument in this Rhapsody of the <HI>Son of Martin,</HI> alias <HI>Belial,</HI> I shall prove,</P>
<P>First, That the Gospel Ministry was found∣ed in an Imparity of Officers, or rather a pro∣per Episcopacy.</P>
<P>Secondly, That neither Idolatry nor Heresy, supposing them universal in all the visible Mem∣bers of the Church, do invalidate the Offices and Functions of the Priesthood.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002510_0076_0FDB64C8942EA428"/>Thirdly, That there are undeniable Eviden∣ces, from Fact and Reason, that the Chain of Succession, in Episcopal Government and Or∣dinations, was never broke; and that the most impious Absurdities follow, upon <HI>Mar-Prelates</HI> Supposition, that ever it was, or could be bro∣ken.</P>
<P>First I affirm, upon the highest as well as clearest Evidences, that the Gospel Ministry was founded in an Imparity of Officers, or ra∣ther a proper Episcopacy. This must be gran∣ted, if the Acts of the <HI>Apostles</HI> are allowed to be Authentick, for these shew them to have been invested with a Superiority over some Brethren, <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> Acts 6.2, 8. 14.11, 12.22.12, 25.13.5. And while the E∣pistles to <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> are allowed to be Canonical, they will continue, and contain De∣monstrations, that those who ordained <HI>Presbyters,</HI> had a Jurisdiction both over them, and their Churches. 1 <HI>Tim</HI> 1, 3, 5, 19, 20, 22. <HI>Tit.</HI> 3.10. And therefore, until Atheism has disproved the Authority of the sacred Register, wherein those Testimonies are preserved, the first Particular must be concluded certain. I proceed then</P>
<P>Secondly, to evince, that neither Idolatry nor Heresy, supposing them universal in all the vi∣sible Members of the Church, do invalidate the Offices, and the Functions of the Priesthood. I say visible Members, for to bring those that are invisible into the Argument, is to go wide of the Case: For an invisible Church can have only invisible Priviledges, and when it loses
<PB N="4" REF="002510_0077_0FDB64CA64BF0738"/>
them, or if it is capable of losing them, cannot be known to us, and therefore the Dispute can only refer to the visible Church; and in that we are to observe a vast Difference betwixt even gross Idolatry, and a total Apostacy, the one of which does, tho' the other does not, de∣stroy the very Being of a Church. Thus tho' the Church of <HI>Rome</HI> believes the Apostles Creed, probably in the same Sense, and upon the same Arguments with us, yet in as much as it worships the true God, under improper Representations, it cannot be excused from the Charge of Ido∣latry: Which, however, is still a Crime of ano∣ther Nature, than a full denying the God that is above, and the Lord that bought them, for this quite destroys the Relation of God in Co∣venant with any People, but the other puts them only so far out of Favour, as they are capable, yet still with a Preservation of their Being: For none who have been admitted into the <HI>Peculium,</HI> are excluded from the Priviledges of it, until they have explicitly renounced the Advantages of being in it. Thus <HI>Aaron</HI>'s Accession to Ido∣latry, did not vacate his Commission of being <HI>High Priest,</HI> nor the People's repeated Idolatry, deprive them of peculiar and distinguishing Bles∣sings, <HI>Neb.</HI> 9.18, 20. And while that Polity stood, the Priesthood remained, even until our <HI>High-Priest</HI> did abrogate that Oeconomy, with all its Rites, and Offices. And even in the early Times of Christianity, we find Churches over∣spread with great Corruptions, as those of <HI>Co∣rinth,</HI> 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.11. 5.7, 11, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.
<PB N="5" REF="002510_0078_0FDB64CD7759C108"/>
and those in <HI>Rev.</HI> Ch. 2 and 3. and for them re∣prehended, but their Being and Existence, was never on that score denied. And now granting his Argument, all the strength it can have, and that for the sake of the invisible Members, the Priviledges of the visible Church were continued, I have the same Evidence on my side, that our Lord had an invisible Church, through all the Ages of Christianity, for the sake whereof, he preserved the Covenant Priviledges, to that which was visible. This he must grant, unless he confesses that the Gates of <HI>Hell</HI> had a greater prevalency over the Christian, than the Jewish Church, which is a Supposition too absurd, ei∣ther to be asked, or allowed: And here we may observe the partial Spirit of the Party, who al∣ledge, that Idolatry, or Heresy, unchurches all, but such as they are; for according to them, the most flagrant Impieties will not unsaint any, on their side. I come now</P>
<P>Thirdly, to evince, that there are undeniable Evidences, from Fact and Reason, that the <HI>Chain of Succession,</HI> in Episcopal Government and Or∣dinations, was never broke, and that the most impious Absurdities follow, upon <HI>Mar-Prelate</HI>'s Supposition, that ever it was, or could be bro∣ken.</P>
<P>First, we appeal to Fact, that as the Gospel Ministry was founded in Episcopacy, so by all who have wrote the History of the Church, from the Acts of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> to this Time, we have an Account of the Churches being universally under Prelatical Government, as from <HI>Eusebius,
<PB N="6" REF="002510_0079_0FDB64D0181252B0"/>
Socrates,</HI> and <HI>Evagrius Scholasticus,</HI> until about the Year 600, and from thence, every Country where Christianity was planted, can produce Registers of their <HI>Bishops,</HI> and we challenge the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> to assign a Time, after the <HI>Apostles,</HI> when there was no Episcopacy, or when it dis∣continued in the Christian Church, or to pro∣duce any Instance of a National Church, that ever was under the Government of meer Presby∣ters before <HI>Calvin,</HI> or even since, but some very few that follow him, in other of his rigid No∣tions. The Instance of the <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lders<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> can be of no Service to them here, unless they prove that their Ecclesiastical Affairs were carried on in a Parity, which they may, after their usual way affirm, but must, as they always do, sail in the Proof. Come we from Fact,</P>
<P>Secondly, To Reason upon the Case, and I argue against the maintainer of that Paradox, that the <HI>Chain of Succession,</HI> can, and has been bro∣ken, from these two Arguments.</P>
<P>First, If it is, the Christian Religion is an Imposture. And</P>
<P>Secondly, Suppose it true, there are now no proper Ministerial Powers therein.</P>
<P>First, If the <HI>Chain of Succession</HI> is broke, the Christian Religion must be an Imposture, for the Author of it affirmed, that he would be with it until the end of the World: Now if he was not so, but by withdrawing his Presence, let it be broken, he failed in his Promise, the Conse∣quence whereof is, to disbelieve every thing he said; for no Reason can be assigned for the
<PB N="7" REF="002510_0080_0FDB64D19B3F4010"/>
Faith of one Article, more than another, which equally depends upon the Veracity of the Asser∣tor, and if the one be found false, the other can∣not be proved true; and so with our <HI>broken Chain,</HI> there is an end of Christianity. But,</P>
<P>Secondly, If we suppose a single failure in this Point, it will make it impossible, that there can be now any proper Ministers of the Gospel; for when the Succession was interrupted, and the <HI>Chain</HI> broke, there must either have been some Power lodged in the Community of Chri∣stians, to soulder it again, or the Original Au∣thor must have made a second, or there must now be none.</P>
<P>The first as false, cannot be proved, for in Fact those Powers were originally left with pro∣per Officers, and not with the Faithful, in com∣mon, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.16 <HI>ad fin. John</HI> 20.19, 20, 21, 22, 23. Nor can any Laws of Necessity, war∣rant an Intrusion, upon what is the peculiar Prerogative of a Divine Power to institute, namely, to appoint Persons to discharge the Sa∣cerdotal Functions, <HI>Numb.</HI> 16.40. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 13.8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 6.6, 7.2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26.19, 20, 21, 22. <HI>Heb.</HI> 5.4, 5.</P>
<P>Not the second, unless they will condescend upon the Time, Place and Persons, when and where this new <HI>Chain</HI> was forged, and to whom committed, and who those are that are now linked in it; and prove that either our Lord came from Heaven to renew it, or delegated some by an audible Voice, or the Power of Miracles to vouch for their Commission to
<PB N="8" REF="002510_0081_0FDB64D667E1EA48"/>
that Purpose, which cannot be done. And there∣fore,</P>
<P>Thirdly, It will necessarily follow, that upon supposing a Breach in the Succession, there has not been any Gospel Ministry since the Moment it happened, nor is there at present, nor can be for the future, without a new Revelation for it.</P>
<P>To sum up then the Evidence upon the Ar¦gument, since it appears from the Divine Re∣cords, that the Gospel Ministry was founded in Episcopacy, and from the same, that neither Idolatry nor Heresy are able to invalidate the Sacerdotal Powers, that in Fact the Episcopal Succession has continued uninterrupted through all the intermediate Ages from the <HI>Apostles</HI> Times to ours, and that the most impious Ab∣surdities follow up <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the denial, the Conse∣quence is unavoidable, that the <HI>Son of Martin,</HI> who would marr Prelacy, and consequentially subvert the Foundations of Christianity, must be a Son of Perdition.</P>
<P>Having thus accounted for what is material in that Libel, I turn to the Appendix, writ in∣deed in a softer Strain, but superiour to the o∣ther in the Arts of Sophistry, for the one is one continued Rhodomantado, but the other now <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our View, has more of Cunning and De∣sign; the Author often varies Shapes and Cha∣racters, to avoid the Stroke he might be subject to, under any one; for now he personates an <HI>Independent,</HI> and anon a <HI>Ruling Elder,</HI> which is
<PB N="9" REF="002510_0082_0FDB64D792E4EDE8"/>
exceeding disingenuous and unfair, to oblige us to enter the Lists with an Enemy in Masquerade. It's true indeed, all the <HI>Sectaries</HI> militate under the same common Standard of <HI>Schism</HI> and <HI>Rebel∣lion,</HI> but then it would be fair to distinguish their Squadrons by their proper Ensigns.</P>
<P>However, we must take him in his way, (an Expression often used ironically by him) and for his Conviction, as well as that of others, I shall set down some Preliminaries, which may give a just turn of Thought to those who have been under an unhappy Biass in the Controver∣sy, and then give the true Sense of the Texts he mistakes or misapplies. As to the Prelimi∣naries, I shall</P>
<P>First explain the Nature of the Commission given to the <HI>Apost<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, consider the Nature of the Gift conferred in Ordination.</P>
<P>Thirdly, enquire whether the <HI>Apostles</HI> were meer <HI>Presbyters,</HI> or whether they were not vested with proper Episcopal Powers.</P>
<P>First, As to the Nature of the Apostolical Commission, which is on all Hands agreed to be the Grand Charter for the Evangelical Ministry, in all its Powers and Offices, it is delivered in such general and yet so few Words, that it is by all confessed, to contain more in its Nature than is expressed; for taking in both Places where the Commission is mentioned, <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19, 20. <HI>John</HI> 20.21, 22, 23. we find nothing to be expressed in both of them, except the Powers of Preaching, of Absolution and Censures, and
<PB N="10" REF="002510_0083_0FDB64DC99FF3278"/>
dispensing one of the Sacraments; but then the other Sacrament must also surely be meant, as well as there must be included therein the Pow∣ers of Ordination and Government, and there∣fore the Intent and Purport of this Commission, must be gathered from the Practice of the <HI>Apo∣stles,</HI> as they understood and explained it in their acting by and upon it.</P>
<P>By virtue whereof we find in Fact, that they ordained <HI>Deacons,</HI> besides some lower Offices to preach and to baptize, that in some Churches they settled <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as at <HI>Corinth,</HI> who had the Powers of both Sacraments and Censures, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.5, 7, 12, 13. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2, 6. and that Diocesan <HI>Bishops,</HI> in whom the Powers of Ordination and Jurisdiction over a Plurality of <HI>Presbyters</HI> &amp; Chur∣ches were annexed, were settled by them, in their respective <HI>Sees,</HI> is evident from the Instances of <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and the <HI>Apocalyptical Angels,</HI> and is made fully to appear in the Defence of the <HI>Modest Proof.</HI> So that if following the Ex∣planations given of this Commission by Aposto∣lick Practice be warrantable, the Assertors of Episcopacy are undoubtedly right. Let us now</P>
<P>Secondly, Consider the Nature of the Gift con∣ferred in Ordination, and thereby is unquestion∣ably meant the Office and the Power whereby to discharge it, and not the Holy Ghost, which never was, nor is it possible to be, in the Power of Man to bestow; for tho' indeed its Influences are conveyed by its glorious Author, through Means and Instruments, as the Word, Sacra∣ments and Imposition of Hands, yet no Creature in a proper Sense, can be said to confer it; and
<PB N="11" REF="002510_0084_0FDB64DD92DE3340"/>
therefore the Expression must be taken in a me∣taphorical Meaning, let it be used by whom and on what side soever. For tho' it's said the Holy Ghost was given at the laying on of the <HI>Apostles</HI> Hands, <HI>Acts</HI> 8.17. yet it is not said they gave it; and tho' our Church retains our Saviour's Form in its Ordinations, and the Ordainers de∣sire the Ordained may receive the Holy Ghost, yet do not say that they bestow it; their Action indeed is the Conduit of its Conveyance, but its self must flow from the Fountain of it.</P>
<P>Thirdly, Let us enquire whether the <HI>Apostles</HI> were meer <HI>Presbyters,</HI> or were not also vested with proper Episcopal Powers; and here the Instan∣ces are plain and numerous to prove them so vested, as in their Ordination of <HI>Deacons,</HI> Acts 6.5, 6. <HI>Elders in every City,</HI> Acts 14.23. and <HI>Bishops,</HI> 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6. <HI>Tit.</HI> 1.5. And it's granted on each side, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> were vested with Jurisdicti∣on over the <HI>Presbyters</HI> and the Churches too.</P>
<P>Having thus adjusted these Preliminaries, I shall now take hold on the <HI>Impartial Hand,</HI> if it is not too nimble or ill-natured to be taken in its own way; and all that is offered will be fully replied to, by setting a few Texts in their true Light.</P>
<P>And First, As to 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6. I will take him in his own way, by condemning <HI>Calvin's Insti∣tutes,</HI> and admitting his <HI>Comment</HI> on the Text that <HI>Timothy</HI> was ordained by a <HI>Colledge of Presbyters;</HI> but then he must grant also, that those <HI>Presbyters</HI> were either <HI>Apostles,</HI> or meer single <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> presiding among them in either Case: If the first, our Point is gained; for the <HI>Apostles</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="002510_0085_0FDB64DF1150FBC0"/>
were not only <HI>Presbyters,</HI> but <HI>Bishops</HI> also in the full and strictest Sense of the Word, by the third Preliminary; and this will save the Credit and the Evidence of the first Epistle to <HI>Timothy</HI> for Episcopacy, and be exactly agreeable to the Practice of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> if the second, its plain, that <HI>Paul</HI> alone conferred the Gift, that is, the Office and the Power of executing it, which is there its meaning, by the second Pre∣liminary, and that the <HI>Presbyters</HI> only gave their Assent, it being impossible in the Nature of the Thing, that the <HI>Presbyters</HI> could have any other Influence on the Act; for taking him in his own way, if the Gift conferred was the Holy Ghost, (which by the way I do not grant) and if <HI>Paul</HI> alone did not conser it, then every single <HI>Presby∣ter</HI> did that as well as he, and every one has Power to give it, which is contrary to his own Scheme, which confines it to the <HI>Apostles;</HI> and it will follow, that the more ordaining <HI>Presbyters</HI> there be, the more of the Holy Ghost the ordain∣ed shall receive; and in that Case, who would not covet to be ordained by an <HI>Oecomenical Coun∣cil</HI> of them, and with such vast Collations of it such a Person might be fitted also to be <HI>Pastor of the Oecomenical Church,</HI> and in Proportion, those who had fewer Ordainers, had fewer Shares in this Gift or the Holy Ghost, and proportionably would be of less use to the Church. Or if by Gift be understood the Office and the Powers for its Execution, as seems most evident, then if <HI>Paul</HI> did <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> alone confer it, it will follow, that each ordaining <HI>Presbyter</HI> conferred a Part, or the Whole
<PB N="13" REF="002510_0086_0FDB64E314226758"/>
of his Gift; if a Part, it would gratify the Pub∣lick, to condescend upon what Part, or how ma∣ny there must be to make up the Whole; if each Ordainer conferred the whole Gift, then in pro∣portion to their Number, must the Offices be multiplied, and then instead of one, there might be a dozen or more Offices conferred, according to the Number of Ordainers. From these Refle∣ctions therefore, and the Absurdities that flow from them, it must be owned, that if there were <HI>Presbyters</HI> who laid their Hands with <HI>Paul</HI>'s on <HI>Ti∣mothy,</HI> that it could be only to express their Con∣sent; so that whether that Place refers to the <HI>Presbyterate</HI> or <HI>Episcopate,</HI> he is extreamly silly who affirms this to be an Evasion, it being demonstra∣ble from the very Nature of the Action, that it could be for no other End. A Second Text is <HI>Acts</HI> 13.1. where he says, we shall find <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> separated to their special Ministry a∣mong the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> by the Hands of certain <HI>Pro∣phets</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> at <HI>Antioch,</HI> who were neither <HI>Apostles</HI> nor <HI>Diocesans,</HI> but has he proved it? no, that is an unusual Method with the Writers on that side; however, we cannot believe them, when the Assertion appears plainly false, as it does in this Case. For in that Text we find Per∣sons there of a superiour Character to meer <HI>Pres∣byters,</HI> and yet only said there to be <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers;</HI> for it's certain <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were <HI>Apostles,</HI> and as such of a superiour Character to meer <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and no Reason can be given to question it in the others, for <HI>Bishops</HI> not being al∣ways mentioned under the Title of their highest
<PB N="14" REF="002510_0087_0FDB64E451D4D5A8"/>
Office and Order, it will not follow, that tho' sometimes named under the Character of their lowest Order, that they have no higher; and therefore it will follow, that if <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were (notwithstanding their being called there <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI>) really <HI>Apostles</HI> or <HI>Bishops</HI> that the o∣thers were also really such, tho' with them also mentioned under inferiour Characters.</P>
<P>As to 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. he here acts the disingenuous Part▪ in not being positive which of the Expositions he is for, whe∣ther he takes the <HI>Eliers</HI> for the same or one, as he words it, or for two kinds of <HI>Presbyters.</HI> I am ready to think he is so far in the right, as to be for the former, and that he al∣lows 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.12. to be a good Comment on that Text, the Sense whereof according to him, must be, that part of your Office which is Doctrinal, is more to be honoured, than that which is Ruling; or you are to be honoured as a <HI>Ruler,</HI> but with half the Honour of a <HI>Teacher.</HI> Now this silly Exposition can have no Consequence, unless he can prove our <HI>Bishops</HI> to have renounced their Powers of Preach∣ing, when they were vested with the Powers of Ruling; and since this is false in Fact, it remains, that since to their Powers of Preaching, there are added the Powers of Ru∣ling, and both Offices joined, the honours annexed to them must be also, and then it will follow, that they are to be honoured with all the Honours due to all the Offices.</P>
<P>Upon the whole therefore, since it's thus evident, even upon the <HI>Appendix maker</HI>'s own way of arguing, that <HI>Paul</HI> alone conferred the Office, with the Powers to execute it, the <HI>Presbyters</HI> only assenting to it, that those who se∣parated <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> were Persons of a superiour Character to meer <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and that <HI>Bishops</HI> who Rule well, and Labour in Word and Doctrine, are to be held worthy of more than double Honour, because if there is a Complication of the Offices, there ought to be of the Honours annexed to them: The Consequence is plain, that the <HI>Appendix maker</HI> has no less mistaken his Argu∣ment than the <HI>Remarker,</HI> and to borrow his own decent Expression, <HI>Confusion must equally cover them both.</HI></P>
