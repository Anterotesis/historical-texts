<HEAD>A REMONSTRANCE.</HEAD>
<P>I Think it is evident, beyond all Reason of Controversy, that no Order, Office or Pro∣fession among Mankind, hath been treated more roughly, and with more satyre and Sarcasm, by the <HI>Independent Reflector,</HI> in his Weekly Essays, than the Clergy; yet I, who am a Clergyman, and besides, one that openly accepted the <HI>Re∣flector's</HI> Challenge, not from a Spirit of Liti∣giousness and Contention, but to take away the Reproach from the Armies of <HI>Israel,</HI> do, notwithstanding, condole the <HI>Reflector's</HI> Fate; nor could I have imagined his Catastrophe would have been such, as the Event hath ascer∣tained; I thought an Author of so masterly a Pen, who besides is so zealous an Advocate for Liberty, would have met with more Ap∣plause, and better Encouragement, than that his own Printer should find it his Interest to cast him off. For my Part, I had my own Reasons, for not making any Encomiums upon his Performances, though at the same Time
<PB N="2" REF="007457_0003_102D92C9DEB1BE08"/>
I could not help admiring them, which, I think, in Point of masterly Writing, have not hitherto been equalled by any in the Province, if in the Land: I do therefore, sincerely acknowledge both the Delight and the Improvement I have received by them, and heartily wish he may again resume his Theme, where he broke it off. I have heretofore confessed, that I thought him not so independent in his secular Animad∣versions, as in his religious Rhapsodies, and am of Opinion, it is Pity, the Public should be de∣prived of his Reflections, notwithstanding some of them prove very unwarrantable in Point of <HI>real Religion:</HI> I say, real Religion; for as to the Arminion and Latitudinarian Scheme, it is so notoriously countenanced and preached up, even by some of the Clergy in this Land, that the <HI>Independent Reflector</HI> cannot possibly say worse; nor have I ever discovered any Thing in him, more diametrically contrary to the Tenor of holy Scripture, and more directly re∣pugnant to the Articles of the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> than I have since found in the Writings of some Clergymen in our Parts of the World; wherefore, as the Fear of his broaching false Doctrine and Heresy, was the chief Reason, which constrained me to attack the <HI>Reflector,</HI> and as he has now been silenced almost a Year, I could wish he would begin again: I remem∣ber to have heard when I was in <HI>Holland,</HI> that
<PB N="3" REF="007457_0004_102D92CD4CC7D1F0"/>
when a Minister of our Church, publickly teacheth any erroneous Doctrine, the Classis to which he belongs, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Synod, behave to∣wards him in this Manner: They first silence him, for the Space of six Weeks, then permit him to preach again; if he desist from his Error, all is well; but if he still persist therein, he is silenced for a longer Time; and at length, after much Admonition, in vain, is deposed, when he is judged quite incorrigible. Ain't it then too hard, that the <HI>Reflector</HI> should be at once silenced and deposed for ever? 'Tis true, he is no Clergyman; what then? We know very well, the old English Law, relating the Benefit of the Clergy, was of such vast Cir∣cumference, that it included all those who could read Latin; <HI>Legit ut Clericus,</HI> said they; and it was enough: And I dare say of the <HI>Reflector, Scribit ut Clericus,</HI> which I am sure is more; besides, who knows, but the <HI>Reflector</HI> may have seen his Errors, and may have heartily repented of them? Or if he has not as yet, who knows but he may in Time to come? Indeed, when I consider, what a Blessing he might be to this Land, if he was really con∣verted and become a new Creature of God, my Soul is inspired with Tenderness towards him; and methinks, I see already by Antici∣pation, him throwing away that arrogant and opprobrious Title of <HI>Independent;</HI> (for the Lord
<PB N="4" REF="007457_0005_102D92CF422EC6E0"/>
knows, we are all poor dependent Creatures, did we but know it too!) contenting himself with commencing <HI>Reflector</HI> only, and besides his Reflections on secular Affairs, pleading the Necessity of Regeneration, Conversion and Holiness of Life, in order to obtain eternal Salvation. Oh! if this should happen, me∣thinks we would be blessed with a <HI>Watts,</HI> a <HI>Doddridge,</HI> or a <HI>Hervey</HI> in our Land; nay, so sanguine are my Hopes, that I even flatter myself, he would yet perhaps, enter into Holy Orders, and combat the Empire of <HI>Chaos,</HI> and ancient Night, from the Pulpit. I do then heartily wish, he may begin again, to set about his Reflections, after this Year's Meditation and Pause; but with this Proviso, that the Press be free and open to all those who think they discover any Errors and Heresies in his Lucubrations, and that the Clergy especially, who are the Watchmen on the Walls of <HI>Je∣rusalem,</HI> keep a good Look-out, and have a watchful Eye over him.</P>
<P>And while I am on this Head, I cannot for∣bear putting my Reverend Brethren, in mind of their Duty, to watch over one another also. Our Land is at present, in a critical Con∣juncture; we are preparing to resist and repel our incroaching Neighbours; we are about erecting a College for the Education of Youth; the Doctrines that are taught among us, will
<PB N="5" REF="007457_0006_102D92D0CB9B7368"/>
have a near Connexion with the good or bad Success of both those important Enterprises. I sincerely thank the <HI>Reflector,</HI> that he hath been so watchful over the Public, as to point out in his Preface, some of the enormous Doctrines, that have been taught by Clergymen at h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e; and I most earnestly entreat him, when he begins again, to be so good as to put up on that Score one lately come abroad in our Land, of which we may say, <HI>there is no Smith in</HI> Israel; and it is this: <Q>As for you, who are yet under the Direction of others, if you behave so as to merit the Esteem of your Parents, Instructors, and good Men, that you are conversant with, you need not doubt of meriting also the love of God in Christ. Thus, however early your Summons from Life maybe, you shall neither fall unprepared nor unlamented. If unsullied Innocence and Purity of Manners, be the Means of Happiness.</Q></P>
<P>This Doctrine I take to be such, that the bare Reading of it, must give some Shock to a pious Mind; wherefore, I am of Opinion it may met with a Reprehension, from the right Reverend Father in God the Bishop of <HI>London;</HI> for I am certain it has a worse Tendency, than the rankest Enthusiasm, which is so often checked from that venerable See. Notwith∣standing, in the mean while, as the Word of
<PB N="6" REF="007457_0007_102D92D285A86CE0"/>
God is the Standard, by which we are to judge concerning those Things, which lead to our eternal Peace, it may not be amiss to open and unfold it a little, and then to compare it to holy Scripture, and to the Articles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that the Contrast may appear.</P>
<P>The Persons here spoken of, or spoken unto, are those who are yet under the Direction of others, that is, the Youth in the Academy, and a Supposition is made, if they behave so as to merit the Esteem of their Parents, In∣structors, and good Men they are conversant with, (which I think no one will deny, or can deny, they may do; nay, they hardly behave so ill as to forfeit the Esteem of their Parents, Instructors, and good Men they are conversant with; for, who can forbear esteeming them, if they are not guilty of any gross Immorali∣ties?) and upon this Supposition, upon this Condition, and upon these Terms, they need not doubt of meriting also the Love of God in Christ; and that in such a Manner, as however early their Summons from Life may be, they shall not fall unprepared. Was there any such Thing (as there is not) of merting the Love of God in Christ, I believe the behaving so as to merit the Esteem of our Parents, Instructors, and good Men we are conversant with, would come very far short of it, and to expect to Merit the love of God in Christ, at this rate,
<PB N="7" REF="007457_0008_102D92D483421F28"/>
would be Sacrilegiously depreciating the same. But come on; let us look into our Bibles, and if I mistake not, we shall find, beyond all Doubt, there is no such Thing as meriting the Love of God in Christ. We read, <HI>Isai.</HI> lxvi. 6. <HI>But we are all as an unclean Thing, and all our Righteousness are as filthy Rags, and we all do fade as a Leaf, and our Iniquities, like the Wind, have taken us away.</HI> We also read, <HI>Jer.</HI> xxiii. 6. <HI>In his Days</HI> (that is, in the Days of the <HI>Messiah) Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: And this is his Name whereby he shall be called, the Lord our Righteousness.</HI> And, <HI>Luke</HI> xvii. 10. <HI>So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those Things which are commanded you, say, We are unprofitable Servants: We have done that which was our Duty to do.</HI> And espe∣cially, <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 8, 9. <HI>For by Grace ye are saved, through Faith, and that not of yourselves: It is the Gift of God:</HI> Not of Works, lest any Man should boast. For my Part, I cannot see how the Doctrine aforesaid, can be ever reconciled to this Doctrine of holy Scripture, or be rendered compatible therewith; they appear to me dia∣metrically opposite, and eversive of one another.</P>
<P>Let us next see, what Account we shall find about the Doctrine, in the Articles of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> which are very scriptural. The XI. Article contains these Words: <Q>We are accounted righteous before God, only for the
<PB N="8" REF="007457_0009_102D92D7AAE9DED0"/>
Merit of our Lord and Saviour <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> by Faith, and not for our own Works, or Deservings. Wherefore, that we are justified by Faith only, is a most wholsome Doctrine, and very full of Comfort, as more largely is expressed in the homily Justification.</Q> The XIIIth Article is thus: <Q>Works done before the Grace of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the Inspiration of his Spirit, are not pleasant to God, foras∣much as they spring not of Faith in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> neither do they make Men mute to receive Grace, or (as the School Authors say) deserve Grace of Congruity; yea, rather for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin.</Q></P>
<P>Now behold how the Doctrine aforesaid, agrees with the Doctrine of the Church! the one saith, (if you behave so as to merit the Esteem of you Parents, Instructors, and good Men that you are conversant with,) you need not doubt of meriting also the Love of God in Christ; the other saith, we are accounted righteous before God, only for the Merit of our Lord and Saviour <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> by Faith, and not for our own Works or Deservings. The modern Doc∣trine teacheth, as for you, who are yet under the Direction of others, if you behave so as to merit the Esteem of your Parents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> you need not doubt of meriting also the Love of
<PB N="9" REF="007457_0010_102D92D9366848A0"/>
God in Christ. The Church teacheth, Works done before the Grace of <HI>Christ▪</HI> and the In∣spiration of his Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch as they spring not of Faith in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> and so forth, as in the Article is ex∣pressed; and surely, I think it can't be believed, that all those who being yet under the Direction of others, behave so as to merit the Esteem of their Parents, Instructors, and good Men they are conversant with, have received the Grace of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the Inspiration of his Spirit: Consequently some are so far from meriting the Love of God in Christ, that they are by meriting the Esteem of Men, not so much as rendered mute to receive Grace, or deserve Grace of Con∣gruity, but their best Works have the Nature of Sin: Which of these two widely different Doc∣trines are we then to believe? It is possible we should behave, and that without doubt, a Doc∣rine set up in manifest Contradiction against the Oracles of sacred and unerring Truth, and against the Articles of the Church? For my Part, I am so far from believing that upstart Doctrine, that I doubt not in the least but it is false, and besides Soul destructive to those who are so unhappy as to believe it: And as such I complain of it; I remonstrate, I protest against it, before God and all his Saints.</P>
<P>O! it grieves me to the Heart, to see a Clergyman of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> run so
<PB N="10" REF="007457_0011_102D92DB251CAFC8"/>
directly counter to holy Scripture, and to the Articles of his own Church, which he hath subscribed, if not sworn to: What must the World think of it? How many despise all Religion for it, and think it is all a Sham, a Farce? Pious and well grounded Minds, who have Truth inwardly, and are inbued with salutary Principles of Religion, will consider that there must be Offences given, on the one Hand, that the faithful be made manifest; and on the other, that there be Stumbling Blocks for those who walk not Upright; but Woe to them by whom they are given! I am not bigotted to the Articles of any Church upon Earth, so as not to recede from them, if I could discover them, to be false. But holy Scripture, the Nature and Fitness of Things, and the Dictates of my own Conscience, assure me, the Love of God, in Christ, is free, undeserved, and un∣merited; and from the contrary Doctrine, Good Lord deliver us!</P>
<P>What shall we then say, of <HI>unsullied Innocence, and Purity of Manners, being the Means of Happi∣ness;</HI> that is, of Happiness after Death, or eternal Happiness. I believe there is no such Thing among the perverse Race of <HI>Adam,</HI> as unsullied Innocence, Purity of Manners; they are all and every one guilty Mortals, polluted and defiled with Sin. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Tenderness and Goodness of Heart, manifested by Persons so young, at∣tone
<PB N="11" REF="007457_0012_102D92DCFA919B48"/>
for far greater Faults than any of them can well fall into? I fear this unsullied Innocence, and Purity of Manners, which is absolved in meriting the Esteem of our Parents, Instruc∣tors, and good Men we are conversant with, (how amiable soever it renders our Character) will, if we confide therein, as the Means of our eternal Happiness, in the End, prove a Shadow without Substance, an illusory Phan∣tom, an erring Metior, an <HI>Ignis fatuus,</HI> to be∣wilder us into the Paradise of Fools. O my God! my Soul is cast down within me, to see such mortal Poyson and deadly Bane, dealt out with an unsparing Hand, to poor unwary dear Souls, who are so very eager to swallow the fatal Bait! Let me believe the Doctrine of the blessed <HI>Jesus,</HI> that whoever will be his Disciple, must deny himself, take up his Cross, and follow <HI>Jesus.</HI> Save thine Elect, O Lord, from giving Credit to false and soul-ruining Doctrines, and let as many as are chosen unto eternal Sal∣vation, be brought to experience the con∣vincing and converting, the renewing and regenerating Operations of the holy Spirit, working in them Faith and Love, that they may confess;
<Q><L>— Thy Merit.</L>
<L>Imputed shall absolve them who renounce</L>
<L>Their own both righteous and unrighteous Deeds,</L>
<L>And live in thee transplanted; and from thee</L>
<L>Receive new Life. —</L>

<P><PB N="12" REF="007457_0013_102D92DF48B7B468"/>Far be from me a Cacoethes of Criticism, upon a pious Oblation of Tears; God forbid, I should be actuated by a Spirit of Detraction, Envy, or Malevolence! No, I take Heaven to Witness, the Reluctance with which I make this Remonstrance. I sympathize in the Loss of that lovely Youth; every tender Passion thrills my Breast: I wish him Rest; a happy Place among the eternal Blest! I hope he has built upon a better Foundation, than the Esteem of Men, or his own unsullied Innocence, and Purity of Manners; upon the Rock of Ages, the Merits of the Lord our Righteousness, may he have rested his dear Soul! I condole with the Tutor; esteem his excellent Talents; I admire the greatest Part of his Performance; did not the Love of my God, the unfeigned Zeal for his Cause, the Desire for the eternal Happiness of precious immortal Souls, con∣strain me to bear my Testimony against Doc∣trines of such pernicious Consequence; this my Writing had been silent as the Grave. But while we are in a Land of Liberty, in which the most enormous and quite monstrous Doc∣trines are broached without Controle, I will fight against them the Battles of the Lord. I shall bespatter no Man's Character: I war not against the Persons, but against the Doc∣trine. What halt we any longer between two Opinions? If <HI>Baal</HI> be God, let us serve him;
<PB N="13" REF="007457_0014_102D92E1931D5F20"/>
but if the Lord be God, let us serve him. That by meriting the Esteem of Men, we do not merit the Love of God in <HI>Christ,</HI> so as not to fall unprepared by Death; that unsullied Innocence, and Purity of Manners, will not do, to those who are wise, to venture upon into Eternity; I take upon me, in the Fear of the Lord, diffident of my own Strength, to main∣tain, against the contrary Doctrine. I will preach, I will write, I will remonstrate, I will protest, without Regard to Person, or Merit, or Genius, or Station, or Office, while God shall enable me so to do; about Opinions which have no Connection with our eternal Concerns, <HI>trahit suaquemque dolusstes,</HI> let every one think as he lists, for aught I care; but here let us stand with undaunted Courage and Magnanimity of Soul, glowing with the Love of Truth, until I either conquer, or am con∣quered; which last should it happen, I shall not be wanting to ascribe its true Cause, my own Weakness and Incapcity; for though I fall, Truth will stand firm and unshaken for ever; and if it stands, I care not whether I stand or fall. I hope an abler Hand and a stronger Arm from among my faithful levitical Brethren, will succeed me: And if we who persevere yet to worship at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> are not a Match for them, who are gone astray after the Golden Calves, erected at <HI>Dan</HI> and <HI>Bethel,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="007457_0015_102D92E416819CA8"/>
I wish the <HI>Independent Reflector,</HI> may come over to us as our Auxiliary. And after all, and in fine, I leave the whole to the Father of Lights, most humbly beseeching him, to lead us into his Truth, and to save us from Soul destruc∣tive, Error and Delusion. Thus Prayeth,</P>
