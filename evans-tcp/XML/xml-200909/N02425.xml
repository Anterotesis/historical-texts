<HEAD>THE Voice of the LORD, FROM <HI>The deep Places of the Earth.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM XCV. 4, 7, &amp; 8th Verses.</HI></BIBL>
<P>IN his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth—To day, if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts, as in the Provocation, and in the day of Temptation in the Wilderness.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>REASON or Thought is that excellent Power in Man, by which he is nearly ally'd to the Angelick World, and advanc'd above the Level of sensitive Beings here below. 'Tis one essential Character of the Divine Image in∣stamp'd on Man at his Creation: and as the regular Exercise of this noble Power is one of the brightest Ornaments of Humanity, so the highest and best <HI>Object</HI> of our Knowlege and Contemplation is the Blessed GOD, whom to know is Life eternal. But then as the Glory of GOD is very conspicuously display'd in the things which his Hand hath formed; so his <HI>Crea∣tures</HI> and <HI>Works,</HI> with the greatest Justice, challenge a Room in our Thoughts, and demand our deliberate Attention to them.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002874_0005_0FE6802DD1BBFE48"/>AS the Works of Nature &amp; Grace, so the Works of Providence, are to be seriously consider'd by us, if we would shew our selves Men. <HI>Who is wise, and he will observe these Things: Prudent, and he shall know them?</HI> The Works of the Lord are great; sought out of all Them that have Pleasure therein. Remem∣ber then that thou magnify his Works which Men behold. To consider them indeed in their Essence and natural Causes &amp; Properties, is not so much the Business of the Christian, as the Philosopher. But the same things which are the Subjects of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> do under different Respects, as they are referred to their Efficient, and Final Cause, also come into Con∣sideration in <HI>Divinity.</HI> — Hence the Scriptures do every where lead us into Contemplations on the Works of Nature, and various <HI>Phaenomena</HI> or Events that come to pass in the World, <HI>as the Works of GOD;</HI> whose <Q>Efficiency runs thro' &amp; influences all Second Causes, and enters into every Effect; preserves the Being and Powers of all the Creatures, and directs all their motions thorow all and above all their next inferiour Ends, to GOD himself as the last End of all.</Q>
<HI>Of Him, and through Him, and to Him, are all Things; to Whom be Glory for ever.</HI></P>
<P>THE Doctrine of a Divine Providence, whereby the vast Variety of Creatures and Things in the Universe, are powerfully upheld in their Existence, Operation, and beautiful Order, and wisely directed to the several Ends and Uses they were made for; is one of the first Dictates of Reason, &amp; abundantly confirm'd by Revela∣tion, which teaches us the unlimited Extent of almigh∣ty Providence, unfolds many Mysteries in the Divine Conduct, and shews us infinite Perfections &amp; Beauties shining in the Works of GOD: — Calls us to Adora∣tion and Praise, and teaches us to acknowlege GOD in every Appearance and Event, and to consider the Operations of his Hand, with a sutable Application to our selves, and Improvement to the Ends of De∣votion; so as not only to see the Name of GOD written upon every Dispensation of Providence, but also to hear
<PB N="3" REF="002874_0006_0FE6802DEFE978F0"/>
his Voice, comport with his wise Designs, and engage our Hearts in the Love, Fear, and Service of Him, who is over all GOD blessed for evermore.</P>
<P>THIS Observation is but agreable to the Scope of the <HI>Psalm</HI> before us; where the devout <HI>Psalmist</HI> stirs up himself and others to praise GOD, with a holy Joy and humble Awe, from an affecting Sense of his infinite Greatness and Goodness, and of their special Obligati∣ons, and Relation to him as a peculiar People: And he calls upon his Nation to live as well as speak the Praises of GOD, to lend an obedient Ear to his Voice, without which all their Songs of Praise would be but an Abomination to Him, an empty Sound yea lothe∣some Flattery. And he presses them to an <HI>instant</HI> Compliance: <HI>To day if ye will hear his Voice.</HI> —Some take it as a wish, O that you would hear his Voice, and be obedient, without delay! And no long∣er <HI>harden your hearts,</HI> as they of old in the <HI>Provoca∣tion and day of Temptation,</HI> lest you provoke GOD to destroy you by awful Judgments, even as He did them, whose Carcases fell in the Wilderness, &amp; to whom He sware, they should not enter into his Rest: So they could not enter in because of Unbelief. They were a rebellious and stiffnecked Generation; full of Infidelity, Murmuring, and Disobedience. They saw the Works of GOD, both his Miracles of Mercy and of Judgment; and yet they were not to be wrought up∣on by these things. Neither the Goodness of GOD in the most eminent Deliverances, nor his Severity in tremendous Judgments, whether on their Enemies, or on some among themselves, wou'd prevail to lead them to Repentance. Particularly when <HI>Korah</HI> and his Company were for their Murmurings destroy'd suddenly by an Earthquake, and devouring Fire, though the Remnant of the People were <HI>affrighted</HI> for the present, and <HI>fled</HI> at the Shrieks of their sinking Friends, saying, Lest the Earth swallow us up also: Nevertheless after Peace was spoken to them, we find them the very next day returned unto Folly, and acting over the same Perverseness and Unbelief, which
<PB N="4" REF="002874_0007_0FE6802F181F23F0"/>
their Companions had so awfully perish'd for. Numb. 16.41. <HI>But on the Morrow all the Congregation of the Children of Israel murmur'd</HI> again. Tho' they had seen so many fall before them, yet they wou'd not take warning: Tho' GOD had signalised his Goodness and Patience in reprieving them from deser∣ved Perdition, yet they repented not to give Him Glory; but turned his Grace into Wantonness, and after their Hardness and impenitent Hearts treasured up unto themselves Wrath; so that the Plague brake in upon them, and GOD wou'd have consum'd them all as in a Moment, had not <HI>Moses</HI> &amp; <HI>Aaron</HI> fallen on their Faces, and quickly made an Atonement for them.</P>
<P>NOW these Things were written for our Admoni∣tion. Hence the Apostle writing to the Christian <HI>Hebrews,</HI> makes use of the awful Example of <HI>Israel's</HI> Fall in the Wilderness, as a loud Caution to them. Heb. 3.7, &amp;c. <HI>Wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith, To Day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts, as in the Provocation. — Take Heed, Bre∣thren, lest there be in any of you an evil Heart of Unbelief,. in departing from the living God.</HI> And in the 15th Verse, he resumes the <HI>Quotation</HI> he had made (which you observe is from our <HI>Text</HI>) and he brings home the Words of the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> by a par∣ticular Application, to the <HI>Christians</HI> he was writing to; as if that Scripture was of equal Concern to the present Generation, as to former Ages. And in the 4th <HI>Chapter</HI> he repeats the Words again, and warns the Christian Hebrews to <HI>labour lest any Man fall after the same Example of Unbelief.</HI> GOD'S Wrath will as soon flame out against impenitent <HI>Christians,</HI> as against Unbelieving <HI>Jews;</HI> against the <HI>present,</HI> as well as against any former Generation of his People; against his People in <HI>Canaan,</HI> as well as against his People in the <HI>Wilderness.</HI></P>
<P>HENCE then the Admonition in the Text belongs to <HI>Us</HI> in these Days, as much as to those of the Psal∣mist's or the Apostle's Times. And O that the Counsel here given may be acceptable to this People
<PB N="5" REF="002874_0008_0FE6802F3B054890"/>
of GOD! That we may be prevail'd with to give a speedy Attention to the Call of our GOD, whose Voice has been crying to the City and Land in a Variety of awful Providences; and particularly in the late sur∣prising <HI>Earthquake,</HI> which spread a sudden and uni∣versal Terror among us! — In a most calm serene Night, just as we were composing our selves to Rest, a dreadful Sound struck our Ears, the Earth trembled and our Houses shook in a fearful manner. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>It was on the <HI>Night</HI> after the Lord's Day (<HI>Octob.</HI> 29.) a little more than half an hour past <HI>Ten,</HI> that the first and great Shake was felt: — when the Heavens were most serene, the Atmosphere in a perfect Calm, and there had been no generally observed Presages of any such Event.</P>
<P>Some say, Before they were sensible of the Shock, they saw <HI>Flashes</HI> of Light glance by their Windows, and others observ'd their Dogs give a sudden bark, as when affrighted. But before any cou'd look about them, to know the meaning of these things, they heard first a gen∣tle Murmur, like a small ruffling Wind, and then a more noisy Rumbling, as of Thunder at some Distance: which seem'd to approach nigher, and grew louder, till it roared terribly; and then we felt our Houses totter and reel, with the tremulous Motion and Heaving of the Earth, as if they wou'd tumble down into Ruins.</P>
<P>It's tho't the <HI>greatest</HI> Earthquake this Country ever knew. Had the first Concussion lasted a few Minutes longer, or been repeated often with equal Force, it's probable much Damage had been done: But by the Mer∣cy of GOD, the Violence was soon over (I believe it scarce exceeded a <HI>Minute &amp; half</HI>) and they were but feebler Shakings, that follow'd, the same Night; or that have in some Places since been perceived: For several Towns to the <HI>Northward</HI> have, for some Weeks now, been scarce a Day free from the rumbling Noise, &amp; fainter Shocks.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Extent</HI> of the Earthquake, it's beyond what has been common. We are already inform'd, it reach'd <HI>Five Hundred</HI> Miles. And the Time of the first Shock seems to have been in all parts with little or no obser∣vable Variation — So that the inflamed Damp, or sub∣terraneous Fermentation, which was the Principle of this great Earthquake, must needs be emphatically in <HI>the deep Places of the Earth;</HI> and there appears a marvellous Hand of the <HI>ALMIGHTY</HI> in it.</P></NOTE> Verily
<PB N="6" REF="002874_0009_0FE6803605D8D768"/>
<HI>it is a Night to be much observ'd</HI> and remembred, for the uncommon Terror, and the great Deliverance. And surely it can't be forgotten, at least while the Repetition of the doleful <HI>Murmurs</HI> &amp; <HI>Shakes</HI> is con∣tinued, as we hear it is yet in divers Places. Last <HI>Lord's Day</HI> Evening it is said several Towns were surprised with the roaring Noise.</P>
<P>UPON this extraordinary Occasion you have doubt∣less all of you already heard proper Lessons and Ad∣monitions from the Pulpit. Yet <HI>I think it meet to stir you up, by putting you in Remembrance;</HI> and hope it will be a word in Season, especially since it is as it were an Address to the whole Province together, in our honorable <HI>Rulers,</HI> and <HI>Representatives</HI> met at this time in a new Assembly.</P>
<P>AND I beseech you, Brethren, suffer the Word of Exhortation, which speaks to you in the <HI>Psalmist's</HI> Language; The LORD is a great GOD, and a great King above all Gods: <HI>In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth,— To day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts as in the Provocation, and in the Day of Temptation in the Wilderness.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Words we have first a Proposition laid down, <HI>In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth.</HI> And then an Exhortation leading us into a proper Im∣provement of that general Truth, <HI>To day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</HI> Which is enforced by the awful Consideration of the Fall and Destruction of the unbelieving <HI>Israelites</HI> in the <HI>Wil∣derness,</HI> who tempted and provoked the most high GOD, so that He was wroth with his Inheritance, and abhorred his People.</P>
<P>IN discoursing on the Text, I shall proceed in the Order &amp; Method of the Psalmist: <HI>First,</HI> I shall say something to illustrate the <HI>Truth</HI> he asserts here: <HI>Secondly,</HI> I shall inculcate the <HI>Duty</HI> he exhorts to. And finally press the <HI>Motive</HI> taken from the Exam∣ple of the <HI>Israelites</HI> that sinned and fell in the Wil∣derness.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002874_0010_0FE680362403C9A0"/>I shall begin with the Psalmist's Pro position, which you may take for the <HI>Doctrine</HI> or Ground of my Dis∣course,</P>
<P><HI>IN the</HI> LORD'S <HI>Hand are the deep Places of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>THE Meaning is, That the whole Earth is the LORD'S, and even from it's Centre, and in all it's Parts, is supported and govern'd by a Divine Power and Influence. GOD has the Propriety, and the Dis∣posal of all.</P>
<P N="1">(1.) HE has a <HI>Propriety</HI> every where, and even the deep Places of the Earth are his Possession.</P>
<P>THIS appears the Meaning in part from what fol∣lows; <HI>The Strength of the Hills is</HI> HIS <HI>also; The Sea is</HI> HIS, <HI>and He made it; and his Hands formed the dry Land.</HI></P>
<P>IT was GOD that originally gave Being to the Earth; 'Twas the Product of his mighty Power, the Contrivance of his Wisdom, and Efflux of his Good∣ness. The holy Scriptures every where ascribe the Creation of the Earth to GOD, and mention it in many elegant &amp; lofty Descriptions of the great Crea∣tor and Sovereign of all Things, as a marvellous Dis∣play of his adorable Perfections; a glorious Piece of divine Workmanship <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 102 35 &amp; 104.5. <HI>Isa.</HI> 51.13. <HI>Jer.</HI> 51 15.</NOTE>. Yea we find the Almighty challenging it as his peculiar Glory <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa</HI> 44 24. <HI>Isa.</HI> 48 12, 13. <HI>Job</HI> 38 4,-7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOW therefore, if GOD created the Earth, He must needs have an indisputable Right of Propriety in it. Hence the Scriptures do frequently assert his Title. Thus, Deut. 10.14. <HI>Behold, the Heaven and the Heaven of Heavens is the Lord's thy God, the Earth also with all that therein is.</HI> Psal. 24.1. <HI>The Earth is the Lord's, and the fulness thereof; the World, and they that dwell therein.</HI> And so our Text, In his hand are the deep Places of the Earth: the subterraneous Springs and Mines; the
<PB N="8" REF="002874_0011_0FE680384A1CE1E8"/>
abundance of the Sea, and the Treasures hid in the Sand. Yea He tells us, Job 41.11. <HI>Whatsoever is under the whole Heaven is mine.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED it is said, GOD <HI>hath given the Earth to the Children of Men:</HI> but it means only, That he has lent or let it out to them: Given it them for a Possession to occupy for the present. We are but Tenants: He is the Landlord, and has reserv'd to Himself the whole Property. Even our very Houses, with all their Furniture, and our Lands, with all the Improvements upon them; all the Produce upon the Surface, and all the Riches within the Bowels of the Earth, are the LORD'S. All the Ends of the Earth, and all the secret Places of it; even the Regions that are out of all human Sight and Reach, They and their rich Contents are His: Not only under his Eye, but in his Hand, possessed by him as much as any other parts of the World.</P>
<P>THIS shows the <HI>unsearchable Riches</HI> &amp; <HI>Greatness</HI> of GOD. Agreably the Psalmist says, <HI>Great is the Lord:</HI> In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth. Surely none of the great Men of the Earth, that trust in their Wealth, and boast themselves in the Multitude of their Riches, can vie with GOD. However large their Possessions, tho' they have added House to House, and Field to Field, and extended their Pur∣chases or Conquests so far that they seem to be placed almost alone in the Earth; yet they cannot compate with GOD: for He is Lord of the <HI>whole</HI> Earth; the utmost parts of the Earth, and the deep places of it, are his Possession; while the Richest of Men possess only some small spots of the upper <HI>Strata.</HI> Let this Reflection teach Men Humility.—And let it teach us to admire the <HI>Condescension</HI> of GOD in accepting the Alms &amp; Devotions of his People. 1 Chron. 29.14. <HI>But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of thee, and of thine own have we given thee.</HI> Surely He is not ministred to by Men's Hands, as tho' He needed any thing, seeing that He is Lord
<PB N="9" REF="002874_0012_0FE6803869C129C8"/>
of Heaven and Earth. Hence He put a slight upon the legal Sacrifices, in those Terms, Psal. 50.12. <HI>If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the World is mine, and the fulness thereof.</HI></P>
<P>Further, THIS teaches us the <HI>Blessedness</HI> of Them that have an Interest in the LORD as their GOD! Behold, Happy is the Man whose Hope is in the Lord. They that have Him for their Portion may be said to possess all Things: Things present and Things to come, all are theirs, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.22. Hence Psal. 89.11, 12, 15. <HI>The Heavens are thine, the Earth also is thine: as for the World, and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them. The North and the South thou hast created them: Tabor and Hermon shall rejoyce in thy name. Blessed are the People that know the joyful sound: they shall walk, O Lord in the light of thy Countenance.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, THIS Reflection affords a Motive to <HI>Obedience;</HI> because GOD is able out of his rich Stores abundantly to reward us. Exod. 19.5. <HI>Now there∣fore, If ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my Covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar Treasure unto me above all People: for all the Earth is mine.</HI> Par∣ticularly it is a strong Incentive to Charity &amp; Bounty, in all those Instances which GOD requires of us. For all the Store that we have prepared cometh of his Hand, and is all his own. He justly therefore expects that we honour Him with our Substance: and in special by willingly expending upon pious and charitable Uses, the Proportions which he hath out of our Estates and Incomes separated to such Ends. We are solemnly charged to give, every Man as he is able, according as GOD hath prospered him <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 16.17. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.2</NOTE>. And if we withhold more than is meet, He charges us with Stealth and Injustice. Mal. 3.8. <HI>Will a Man rob God? yet ye have robbed me: but ye say, Wherein have we robbed thee? In tithes &amp; offerings.</HI> Where∣fore as we wou'd not incur the Guilt of Injustice, as
<PB N="10" REF="002874_0013_0FE6803FA38A9648"/>
well as Ingratitude, let us see to it that we be ready to distribute, willing to communicate. To do Good and to communicate, forget not: for with such Sa∣crifices GOD is well pleased. Render to all their dues, Tribute to whom Tribute is due, Honour to whom Honour, Charity to whom Charity. Bring ye <HI>all the Tithes</HI> into GOD'S Store-house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord, if I will not pour you out a Blessing, so that your Barns shall be filled with Plenty, and ye shall dwell in a delightsome Land, saith the Lord of Hosts, the most High GOD, Possessor of Heaven and Earth.</P>
<P>I pass now to say,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) ANOTHER Thing imply'd may be, That GOD <HI>Upholds</HI> the Earth in it's Being, and continues it's several Virtues, Riches and Ornaments.</P>
<P>THE Earth, and all it's deep Places, He holds in his Hand, and keeps from Desolation. Should He withdraw His sustaining Influence but for a moment, the Earth wou'd immediately return to it's primi∣tive Chaos, or relapse into Nothing. By his Al∣mighty <HI>Fiat</HI> the Earth, with it's immense Stores and Treasures, started into Being; and He upholds all Things by the same Word of his Strength. No Crea∣ture has a Power of Self-preservation; nor can one preserve another: but all depend upon the First Cause, and equal is the Efficiency of the Almighty, in the Sustentation of the Earth, as in it's original Crea∣tion.</P>
<P>THE upholding and preserving of this visible World is every where in holy Scripture declar'd the Work of his omnipotent Arm, and celebrated as one of the high Glories of infinite Majesty. Jer. 51.15. <HI>He hath made the Earth by his Power; He hath established the World by his Wisdom.</HI>— When He had created the Earth, He fixed this vast Globe on it's Centre, and settled the Orders and Uses of all Things therein. Hence we read, Psal, 104.5. <HI>Who laid the Foundations of the Earth,</HI> or as it is in the Margin,
<PB N="11" REF="002874_0014_0FE6803FC62C3EF8"/>
Hath founded the Earth upon her Bases. This vast Terraqueous Globe has no visible Foundations to sup∣port it, no Pillars to rest upon, nor Axletree on which it hangs; but is suspended in the Air, pois'd with it's own weight, we know not how. A Mystery this is, celebrated by all Philosophers as one of the in∣scrutable <HI>Arcana</HI> of Nature, and the Result of Di∣vine Power &amp; Wisdom. <HI>Job</HI> mentions it with won∣der, Chap. 26.7. <HI>He stretcheth out the North over the empty Place, and hangeth the Earth upon No∣thing.</HI> When GOD spake to <HI>Job</HI> out of the Whirl∣wind, among other Challenges, He made that, Chap. 38.5, 6. <HI>Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who hath stretched the line upon it? Whereupon are the Foundations thereof fastned? or who hath laid the Corner-stone thereof?</HI> "The vast Bulk of the Earth is model'd as regularly as if it had been done by Line and Measure": And re∣tains to this Day the same Figure &amp; Dimensions that it had at first; continued by the Power of GOD, who <HI>laid the Corner-stone</HI> thereof, which preserves the Parts of it in a just Consistence, and saves them from crum∣bling into Confusion. And He also <HI>fasten'd the Foundations,</HI> so that this prodigious Weight has kept thro' many Ages it's primitive Situation, which gives it still the Advantage of the Atmosphere, and the heavenly Orbs round about it. This is the Work of GOD. <HI>His strength setteth fast the Mountains,</HI> and He is the Confidence of all the Ends of the Earth. He comprehendeth the Dust of the Ground in a mea∣sure, and weigheth the Hills in a Balance. He visits the dark Caverns of the Earth, and preserves it's Bowels from gushing out. He guards the Earth from the Violence of the Sea, and continues the ancient Division of the Waters from the dry Land. He sets Bars to the Ocean, and holds the mighty Abyss in the Hollow of his Hand. He poises this terraqueous Globe so equally on every side; maintains a just Pro∣portion of the Elements, and the convenient Distribu∣tion of solid and fluid Bodies.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="002874_0015_0FE68042706FD760"/>HE also preserves the different <HI>Natures</HI> of Things, their essential Qualities, and original Instincts, or Tendencies to the various Ends &amp; Uses they were adapted and design'd for. The Laws of <HI>Gravitation</HI> and <HI>Magnetism,</HI> and the Law of <HI>Instinct,</HI> those myste∣rious Contrivances of His infinite Wisdom, are esta∣blish'd in the Word by his Almighty Hand; by which Means the several Parts of the Earth afford their va∣rious Productions for the Support &amp; Service of it's In∣habitants, in their innumerable Species, and with a most surprising Harmony all Things conspire to serve the particular Purposes they were made for, which terminate in the Benefit of the Universe and Glory of the Creator. Well may we make those Reflections, with the devout Psalmist <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. 104.24.—119.90, 91.—74.16.17.</NOTE>, <HI>O Lord, how manifold are thy Works! In Wisdom hast Thou made them all: The Earth is full of thy Riches; so is the great and wide Sea: wherein are Creatures innumerable. These wait all upon Thee. Thou preservest Man and Beast. Thy Faithfulness is unto all Generations: Thou hast established the Earth, and it abideth. They continue this Day according to thine Ordinan∣ces: for all are thy Servants. The Day is thine; the Night also is thine.— Thou hast set all the Bor∣ders of the Earth: Thou hast made Summer and Winter.</HI></P>
<P>O let us stand up and bless the Lord our GOD for ever and ever; whose glorious Name is exalted above all Blessing and Praise. And let all the Earth fear the Lord: let all the Inhabitants of the World stand in Awe of Him: for <HI>He spake, and it was made: He commanded, and it stood fast</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal 33.8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>In a word, LET the People of GOD improve this Consideration to confirm their Faith, and invigorate their Hope in the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> that it shall stand fast for ever, even as the Covenant of Nature. So GOD himself has taught his People to reflect and argue, Jer. 31.35, 36, 37. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the
<PB N="13" REF="002874_0016_0FE6804295E60888"/>
ordinances of the Moon and of the Stars for a light by night; which divideth the Sea when the Waves thereof rore; the Lord of hosts is his name. If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the seed of Israel also shall depart from being a Nation before me forever. Thus saith the Lord, If Heaven above can be measured, and the Foun∣dations of the Earth searched, out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel, for all that they have done, saith the Lord.</HI> So <HI>Chap.</HI> 33.20, 21, 25, 26.</P>
<P>IT may be added now in the last place,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) GOD not only preserves, but also <HI>governs</HI> the Earth, and all Things that are therein.</P>
<P>THIS Act is imply'd in the former, and the Right of Dominion is justly founded thereon. Neh. 9.6. <HI>Thou, even Thou art Lord alone: Thou hast made the Heaven, Earth &amp; Seas, and all that is therein; and Thou preservest them all.</HI>— So the Psalmist, <HI>The Lord is a great God, a great King above all gods▪ In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>THE Government is in his Hand; His right Hand, and his holy Arm governs the Wheels of universal Nature. In his Hand is Power &amp; Might, and He reigneth over all. Heaven is his Throne, and the Earth his Foot-stool.</P>
<P>HE governs the <HI>Rational</HI> World; doth what He pleaseth among the Armies of Heaven above, and amongst the Inhabitants of the Earth below. The Kingdom is the Lord's, and He is the Governor among the Nations. In his Hand it is to make great, or bring low; to make rich, or poor. The Lord is the Judge: He putteth down one, and setteth up ano∣ther. For the Pillars of the Earth are the Lord's, and He hath set the World upon them. He governs in all Societies, and rules over all Individuals; restraining, guiding, punishing, or blessing, as He pleaseth. He ruleth by his Power for ever: His Eyes behold the Nations: let not the Rebellious exalt themselves. But rejoyce in the Lord ye Righteous. The Lord
<PB N="14" REF="002874_0017_0FE6801DDD7F48E8"/>
reigneth: GOD is my King of old, working Salvation in the midst of the Earth.</P>
<P>HE also presides over the <HI>Natural</HI> World. He ex∣tends his Care and Influence to all his Creatures, both small and great. None are so little as to escape his Notice: Nor any too big for Him to manage. <HI>What∣soever the Lord pleaseth,</HI> that doth He in <HI>Heaven</HI> and in <HI>Earth,</HI> in the <HI>Seas</HI> &amp; <HI>all deep Places,</HI> Psal. 135.6. Nature is not left to govern it self; is not resign'd to the wild Steerage of blind Chance: But GOD sitteth upon the Circle of the Earth, as a wise &amp; powerful Director, influencing all natural Causes, and disposing all Effects &amp; Accidents, Periods, Revolutions, and Successions of Things.</P>
<P>THE glorious Orbs of <HI>Light,</HI> that roll over our Heads, are preserv'd by Him in their Beauty &amp; Order, and directed by Him in all their Motions and Effects. The <HI>Earth</HI> also under our Feet, and the <HI>Air</HI> we breathe in, are under his absolute Dominion.</P>
<P>HE made the Elements, and He governs them: di∣rects their natural Powers, and orders all their Influ∣ences &amp; Operations; suspending, or enlarging, as He will. Men are indeed sometimes apt to imagin, that the Elementary World is under no Direction, that a wild Loose is given to natural Causes, and that they act with an unbounded Liberty. But verily in the midst of all the Confusion and Impetuosity that is seen at any time, GOD inspects, restrains, and over-rules, to make every thing subserve his own blessed Purpo∣ses. Hence that of the Psalmist, Psal. 148.7, 8. <HI>Praise the Lord from the Earth, ye Dragons and all Deeps, Fire &amp; Hail, Snow &amp; Vapour, and stormy Wind, fulfilling his Word.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Depths as well as Heights, GOD shews his Power and Dominion. He sendeth forth his Com∣mandment upon Earth; His Word runneth very swiftly <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 147.15.</NOTE>: and none can resist his Will, countermand his Orders, or retard their Execution.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002874_0018_0FE6804993652238"/>THIS earthly Globe is continually passing under <HI>Changes</HI> and Revolutions. There are perpetual Re∣moves &amp; Alterations, Increases &amp; Decays, visible on the Face of the Earth; and doubtless the like in it's interiour Parts. There is a kind of Circulation among natural Principles; a Revolution of the Elements. Thus the terrestial Matter wash'd off the Earth by Floods, is a great part of it exhal'd up into the At∣mosphere with the daily ascending Vapours, and re∣stored to the Ground by Rain, Snow &amp; Hail. Again, The Waters which by various methods of Conveyance are sent forth upon the Earth, are return'd back to the Seas. And so the Elements of Fire &amp; Air mutually lose &amp; gain, by frequent Condensations &amp; Rarefacti∣ons. Insomuch that all these sublunary Things are in a perpetual Flux &amp; Change: even the most consistent Parts not exempted. The Earth feels terrible Con∣vulsions in it's very <HI>Bosom</HI> many times, so that it groans and trembles: and were it not for the Spiracles or Vulcanoes, those awful, yet merciful Contrivances of Divine Wisdom, which serve to extract &amp; evaporate the subterraneous Fumes; innumerable Mischiefs, greater and oftner than is now known, wou'd befall the World, by Earthquakes, Damps, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, in the midst of all these Vicissitudes of Na∣ture, <HI>GOD presides;</HI> directing the most secret and distant Causes, and ordering all their Effects, by his Power and Wisdom. —Indeed in all the Revolutions of the World, we may suppose there wou'd be no proper Tumult or Confusion, were it not for the Per∣mission of Divine Providence. For the GOD of Nature hath so equally poised the Earth on every side, and formed all Things in Number, Weight &amp; Measure, in such Order &amp; Harmony, with those Instincts which fit and dispose them to the particular Uses &amp; Designs they were made for, and so to be subservient to one another, that we may reasonably conclude our Globe wou'd be free from all those Violences it sometimes feels, were it not for the Will &amp; Power of Divine Providence.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002874_0019_0FE68049B18E66C0"/>THE Almighty Hand of GOD reaches the very Centre of our vast Globe, and equally governs in the inward Parts, and the superficial: So that it is liable to no Accidents whatever, without his active Con∣currence, who worketh all things according to the Counsel of his own Will.</P>
<P><HI>IN his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth,</HI> says my Text. And therefore all Events in the <HI>ha∣bitable</HI> World must be the Result of his Efficiency: For the subterranean Kingdom gives Law to the World we dwell in. The upper Stratum of the Earth yields us no other Comforts, but what depend upon the Re∣gularity &amp; Influence of the deep Places beneath, which are the common Magazines of all Riches.</P>
<P>THE small Fissures &amp; wider Cavities in the low Places of the Earth, as well as the high Hills and rocky Mountains, appear the Work of Counsel, and are of indispensable Use to the World. We have not only our Treasures of useful <HI>Minerals</HI> and <HI>Metals,</HI> and <HI>Salts</HI> from below: but from hence also we have our Supply of <HI>Springs</HI> &amp; <HI>Rivers.</HI> From hence ascend the Vapours, the watry and fiery Steams, which ex∣hal'd by the Sun, form our <HI>Clouds,</HI> and distil in <HI>Rain, Snow</HI> &amp; <HI>Dew,</HI> that refresh the Earth, and make it Fruitful. From hence likewise arise the <HI>Winds,</HI> which fan our Air, and purify the Atmosphere that surrounds us, from those noxious mineral Exhalations, that tend to breed pestilential Fevers, and threaten the Health and Lives of Men.</P>
<P>IN a word, All the <HI>Seasons</HI> of the Year, and the several Circumstances of them, are very much govern'd by the subterraneous Regions. Our Wealth and the valuable Comforts of Life, are mostly of a subterranea∣nean Extract. <HI>Job</HI> observes not only that <HI>Iron</HI> is taken out of the Earth, &amp; there are the Veins of <HI>Silver</HI> &amp; <HI>Gold:</HI> But he adds, As for the Earth, <HI>Out of it cometh</HI> BREAD. The vegetable Productions of Nature, the orderly Re∣turns of Seed-time &amp; Harvest, Cold and Heat, in their due Season, and in a just Proportion, depend very much upon a regular State of Things in the Mineral

Kingdom, and dark Retreats of the Earth below us.</P>
<P>WHAT follows then, if in GOD'S Hand be the <HI>deep Places</HI> of the Earth, but that He must be the supreme Moderator and Disposer of this universal Globe! And consequently we learn from our Text these <HI>two</HI> important Lessons:</P>
<P>First, <HI>THAT GOD must have the</HI> Praise <HI>of all the</HI> beneficial <HI>&amp;</HI> beautiful <HI>Appearances in the King∣dom of Nature.</HI></P>
<P>AND then,</P>
<P>Secondly, <HI>THAT in all</HI> terrible <HI>&amp;</HI> evil <HI>Events, we must see his Hand, and acknowlege his Provi∣dence.</HI></P>
<P>AGREABLY the Scriptures every where teach us to consider GOD as the <HI>Author</HI> of all those <HI>Benefits</HI> and Salvations, which the Earth and it's Inhabitants do experience. They tell us that He is the <HI>Father of Lights</HI> and <HI>Fountain of Living Waters.</HI> He giveth unto all Life and Breath and all Things. He feeds the Fowls of Heaven, which neither sow nor reap, and he giveth the Beast his Food. And He provideth Bread for Man. It is He that prospers a People in their Trade abroad and Business at home: makes <HI>Ze∣bulun</HI> to rejoyce in his goings forth, and <HI>Issachar</HI> in his Tents: and giveth them Power to get Wealth; to suck of the abundance of the Sea, and the Trea∣sures of the dry Land. He causeth his Sun to rise, and giveth the Rain in it's Season; making the Ground to yield it's Increase, and the Trees their Fruits; and He reserveth to us the appointed Weeks of the Harvest. When he uttereth his Voice, there is a multitude of Waters in the Heavens, and He <HI>causeth the Vapours to ascend from the Ends of the Earth:</HI> He maketh Lightnings with Rain, and <HI>bringeth forth the Wind out of his Treasures,</HI> by which he preserves our Air from stagnating, and prevents the innumerable Mis∣chiefs that otherwise wou'd be done by poisonous Steams out of the Earth; and by which also He carries our Ships to the desired Haven. By his Skill &amp; Power
<PB N="18" REF="002874_0021_0FE6804C231BE658"/>
the Depths are broken up, and the Dew &amp; Clouds formed, which gently distill to refresh the thirsty Ground. He causeth the Bud of the tender Herb to spring forth; maketh the Grass to grow, filleth the Trees with Sap, and prepareth the Corn; so that the Mountains rejoyce, and the little Hills on every side; the Valleys break forth into Singing, and all the Fields &amp; Orchards clap their hands for joy. He also preserveth the Fruits of the Faith; gives a sutable Time for Ingathering, and crowns the Year with his Goodness. Thus He governs the <HI>Spring,</HI> and <HI>Sum∣mer,</HI> and <HI>Autumn.</HI></P>
<P>HE maketh also the <HI>Winter,</HI> and governs all the Affairs and Circumstances of it. He saith to the <HI>Snow,</HI> Be thou on the Earth, and bringeth the <HI>Cold</HI> out of the North. By the Breath of GOD, <HI>Frost</HI> is given, and the Breadth of the Waters is straitned. He casteth forth his <HI>Ice</HI> like Morsels; scattereth the Hoar-frost like Ashes, and giveth Snow like Wool: So He co∣vereth the Earth as with a Garment, to cherish the Soyl, that it may give Seed to the Sower, and Bread to the Eater. Moreover, He provides our <HI>Fuel;</HI> fur∣nishes our <HI>Table,</HI> preserves our <HI>Health,</HI> and maketh our Garments warm upon us, in this difficult Season of the Year: Else who cou'd stand before his Cold? In a word, He returns the Heats and Thaws of the <HI>Spring.</HI> He sendeth out his Commandment, and the frozen Surface of the Ground melts and softens. He quieteth the Earth by the South-Wind: and by the gradual In∣creases of the Day and Advances of the Sun, He re∣vives universal Nature, and strips it of it's Winter-Complexion. He sends forth his Spirit (his warm and animating Breath) and renews the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>HENCE then let us give <HI>all the Glory</HI> to GOD, and celebrate his Wisdom and Power, his Goodness and Mercy to us from Year to Year, with Thanksgiving and Praise. O how unworthy are we of the least of his Mercies! Yet He crowneth the Year with a Va∣riety and Plenty of Blessings. What but infinite Good∣ness cou'd so triumph over the Unworthiness of sinful

Creatures; and be kind to the Evil and Unthankful! Verily the Earth is satisfied with the Fruit of his Works, and is full of his Riches. All our Senses present us with numerous Instances of Divine Goodness. We taste and see that the Lord is gracious: Our Ears also have heard the Fame thereof. O let us awake up our Glory, to sing and give Praise! Let the Heaven and Earth praise the Name of GOD; the Seas also, and every thing therein. <HI>O come let us sing unto the Lord</HI> (says the Psalmist in the Context) <HI>let us make a joyful Noise to the Rock of our Salvation. Let us come be∣fore his Presence with Thanksgiving, and make a joyful Noise unto Him with Psalms. For the Lord is a great God, and a great King above all gods: In his Hand are the deep Places of the Earth.</HI> He is our God, and we are the People of his Pasture.</P>
<P>BUT yet the Lord has not left us <HI>altogether un∣punished.</HI> He has been correcting us with Stripes from Year to Year: and this Year in a particular manner, He hath been alarming us by a Variety of awful Dis∣pensations, which call for our solemn Observation and Remembrance. Our Text teacheth us to look above natural Causes, and ascribe to a Divine Hand all the evil Accidents which happen in the Earth. The so∣vereign GOD controuls and commands all Things here below, so as to make them even forget their particular Instinct, act contrary to their native Tendency, and desert their proper Place, according to his absolute Will and Pleasure. <HI>Who is a strong Lord,</HI> like unto HIM, whom Fire, and Wind, and Seas obey; who looketh upon the Hills and they tremble! All Me∣teors and Elements are obsequious to Him, who gave Nature it's Laws, and directs it's Motions as He plea∣seth. His Way is in the Whirlwind, and in the Storm, in the Thunder and Lightning, in the Flame of Fire, in the stifling Damp, and tremendous Earthquake▪— All which, and other Judgments, we have this Year been visited with. O let us see the Hand of GOD lifted up, and tremble at his repeated loud Reproofs.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="002874_0023_0FE6805271317D98"/>IN this Town particularly, how has GOD been cal∣ling to contend by <HI>Fire</HI> once and again! Tho' in his great Mercy He has set Bounds to this wild Element, and soon extinguish'd the threatning Flames.</P>
<P>IN the Beginning of the Year what uncommon <HI>Colds</HI> &amp; <HI>Sicknesses</HI> (occasion'd by noxious Vapours out of the Earth) prevail'd every where: And what a <HI>Mortality</HI> since in several Towns! Tho', blessed be GOD! It has been in general a healthy Year.</P>
<P>WHAT repeated awful Instances have we seen of very <HI>sudden Death!</HI> And one GREAT Instance, which has put the whole <HI>British</HI> Dominions into uni∣versal Mourning, by the Bereavement of our late glorious KING; of happy Memory! Tho' blessed be GOD the Judge, who in as sudden a manner fill'd the Throne with <HI>another</HI> Protestant <HI>King,</HI> and is incir∣cling Him with Glory and Happiness, in a fruitful VINE by the sides of his House and flourishing <HI>Olive-Plants</HI> around his Royal Table.</P>
<P>IT has been a Year fill'd with a Variety of strange <HI>Accidents,</HI> and surprising <HI>Mortalities,</HI> whereby we have been alarm'd from time to time. In particular, because of it's obvious Reference to my present Subject, I wou'd mention the awful Instance of the fatal <HI>Damp,</HI> by which <HI>two Men</HI> perish'd almost in the same Moment in one <HI>Well</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">In Boston, <HI>July</HI> 19. this surprising Accident happen'd. The Well had not been open'd for many Years before: and in going down to examin it, the <HI>Master</HI> &amp; <HI>Servant</HI> successively were both smother'd; by some mineral Ex∣halation, or other suffocating Vapour, they were im∣mers'd in. And a <HI>Third</HI> essaying to follow them, with a Rope lash'd about him, had not descended two Yards before he felt his Breath expiring: but being instantly drawn up, he soon recovered.— <HI>Surely every Man at his best Estate is Vanity. LORD, make me to know how frail I am!</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="002874_0024_0FE6805293BC75B0"/>WHAT an uncommon Summer have we had, for <HI>Heat,</HI> the most extreme, and of long Continuance! By which GOD appointed over us Terror, and seem'd to intimate his firy Indignation. Yet notwithstand∣ing the extraordinary Drought, which threaten'd us, He hath in his great Goodness allow'd us a plentiful Harvest of many Fruits of the Earth.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, How has the LORD of Hosts been fre∣quently uttering his Voice from the Skies in very dreadful Accents of amazing <HI>Thunder,</HI> and shooting out his incensed Arrows from above: Whereby seve∣ral received Damage in their <HI>Substance</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">One and another had their <HI>Buildings</HI> hurt, and their <HI>Beasts</HI> kill'd. And some <HI>Persons</HI> were struck, but I think none given over to Death.</NOTE>; tho' thro' the sparing Mercy of GOD, no human Life has been lost.— Once in particular how did He set the Hea∣vens over our Heads on a Blaze, in a most unusual and surprising manner; bright Streams of Fire darting incessantly in every part: So that we tho't we saw some Resemblance of the Day of GOD, when the Lord <HI>JESUS</HI> shall be reveal'd from Heaven in <HI>flaming</HI> Fire; and many were sore afraid! His Light∣nings illuminated the World; the <HI>Earth saw and trembled.</HI></P>
<P>Again, HE prepared the <HI>Stormy Wind,</HI> and blew upon us with an <HI>horrible Tempest.</HI> He sent forth the Blast of his Mouth, and caused the Rain of his Strength to come down. So that universal Nature seem'd to be out of Course; the Foundations of the World break∣ing up, and the Pillars of Heaven falling down. It was a very distressing Season, both on the Sea &amp; Land. And all the People (as they in <HI>Ezra</HI>'s Time) sat <HI>trembling</HI> for the <HI>great Rain.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This Storm was on <HI>Sept.</HI> 16. "By it great Damage was done to our <HI>Wharves</HI> &amp; <HI>Shipping;</HI> as also to the <HI>Fruits</HI> of the Earth, and to many <HI>Buildings.</HI> Great Numbers of <HI>Trees</HI> were torn up by the roots, and several <HI>Chimneys</HI> blown down. A Kitchen-Chimney falling, beat in the Roof; <HI>kill'd</HI> a <HI>Child,</HI> and very much <HI>wounded</HI> several.— The Storm lasted till Midnight: And it was very awful the next Morning to see the <HI>Desolations</HI> that were made in the Earth. Yet the Prospect was brighten'd by a very fair <HI>Rainbow</HI> in the Heavens; a Sign of the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD, that the Waters shou'd no more become a Flood to destroy all Flesh.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="002874_0025_0FE68054D6F912B0"/>AND in a few Weeks after, GOD has been pleas'd to visit us in another and more unusual Form, by EARTHQUAKE, and <HI>great Noise,</HI> which may be call'd Subterranean Thunder; a Thunder-Storm un∣der ground, in <HI>the deep Places of the Earth.</HI> This I shall take Notice of with a little more of Enlargement.</P>
<P>PHILOSOPHY teaches us to suppose that the Earth is not a perfectly solid Body, but has mighty <HI>Caverns</HI> within it, and innumerable lesser <HI>Veins</HI> and hollow Spaces; where are Fountains of Water, or Treasures of Winds &amp; Vapours. And the whole Globe is filled with vast Stores of Fire and combustible Materials. These appear to be the Provisions in Nature for those terrible Convulsions the Earth is sometimes thrown into.</P>
<P>BUT the Lord of Hosts is the grand EFFICIENT. All the Power and Skill of Men can't produce an Earthquake. It must be said of it, <HI>This is the Fin∣ger of GOD.</HI> There have been some Instances, wherein it's thought physical Reasons have been wanting, and the Commotion of the Earth intirely miraculous, the immediate Effect of a supernatural and divine Influence, without any Preparations in Nature: as that at the giving of the Law, when the Lord de∣scended upon <HI>Sinai,</HI> and the whole Mount <HI>quaked greatly.</HI> So those at the Death and Resurrection of CHRIST; and others mention'd in Scripture.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, doubtless in ordinary Cases at least, there are natural Causes of this <HI>Phaenomenon.</HI> But yet the most critical Inquirers into Nature are at a loss how to account for the generating of the Earthquake, and the Operations of it, without ascribing a great
<PB N="23" REF="002874_0026_0FE68054FA9F37A8"/>
deal to the more immediate Influence of some super∣natural Power. Naturalists agree in this general Con∣cession, That the Earthquake is not any regular Mo∣tion of Nature, but a Violence to it, and throws the Earth into a praeternatural State. They confess it is contrary to the establish'd Laws of the Creation, and results from some mighty Obstruction to the stated Order and Course of Things.—But what that Obstruc∣tion is, or what the particular Principle &amp; Ground of it, remains yet an Inquiry that the most penetrating Philosophers are to this Day perplex'd &amp; divided about. Some derive it's Origin from this natural Cause, and others from that. One ascribes it chiefly to that Ele∣ment, and another to this. They mutually oppose one another's Sentiments: And the most that is said upon this mysterious Appearance is but Conjectural.</P>
<P>IT seems truly to be a more immediate Act of Pro∣vidence, than most other Events. It must be look'd upon as a more special Work of GOD; visibly out of the Course of Nature: produc'd and govern'd by the great Creator, who has all the Wheels of the Uni∣verse under his arbitrary Command. <HI>He gathereth the Wind in his Fists; bindeth the Abyss in a Garment;</HI> restraineth the subterraneous Fires; and <HI>establisheth all the Ends of the Earth.</HI> His Eye and Hand reach the profoundest Caverns; and his <HI>Footsteps are not known.</HI> If the Lord our GOD did not govern the Elements in our Favour, how wou'd they persecute a guilty World, by Fire, and Tempest, Plague, and Famine! How soon wou'd the Heavens dissolve and fall upon us in Cataracts of Vengeance: And the Earth and Sea combine to destroy all their Inhabitants! Why does not the Earth sink into the mighty <HI>Deep,</HI> on the face of which it is <HI>stretched out</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> 136.6.</NOTE>? Or what Hand confines and rules the flaming <HI>Fires</HI> in it's spacious Cavities? What power visits one City or Country with the desolating <HI>Earthquake,</HI> and not another? Verily the same DIVINE Power, which in the Days of <HI>Korah</HI> created that <HI>new Thing,</HI> when the Earth
<PB N="24" REF="002874_0027_0FE6805CFB5C9050"/>
open'd, and Multitudes together went down alive into the Pit.</P>
<P>WHEN the Order of Nature is subverted, the Rule of natural Causes violated, and praeternatural Com∣motions happen, all must be ultimately resolv'd into an higher Principle, than any second Causes, even the Providence of GOD. When Things move and act either <HI>against</HI> or <HI>above</HI> their own Nature, a superior Power is to be acknowleg'd: And in some Instances especially, the <HI>Earthquake</HI> consider'd in it's extraor∣nary Circumstances and Effects, must be ascribed to the more immediate Hand of GOD, as in a sense his alone Work.— Whatever subordinate Means &amp; In∣struments GOD may see fit to make use of in this stu∣pendous Event; yet his terrible Majesty appears im∣printed upon it in very peculiar Characters. It has a bright Stamp of Divinity on it's Face; Men behold in it those clear Impresses of Divine Power, Sove∣reignty and Greatness, as irresistibly carry up their Eyes to the First Cause; and they cannot but appre∣hend the Invisible GOD therein displaying his Per∣fections to the World. The Lord as it were comes down, &amp; at his Presence the Earth shakes &amp; rores. That is the Language of this Providence, <HI>Give Ear, O Heavens; and hear, O Earth! I will publish the Name of the Lord: Ascribe ye Greatness unto God.</HI> These awful Shocks and Rumblings are design'd (as the Thunder and Shakings of the <HI>Heavens</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> 4 35, 36. &amp; <HI>Exod</HI> 9 29</NOTE> are) to let us know that the Universe is the LORD'S, and to <HI>magnify Him</HI> in the Eyes of his intelligent Creatures. Thus it is said <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ezek.</HI> 38.19— 23</NOTE>, <HI>In that day there shall be a great SHAKING in the Land of</HI> Israel; So that the Fishes of the Sea, and the Fowls of the Heaven, and the Beasts of the Field, and all the Men that are upon the face of the Earth, shall <HI>shake at my Presence,</HI> and the Mountains shall be thrown down, and the steep Places shall fall, and every Wall shall fall to the Ground; <HI>&amp;c. Thus will I magnify my self, — and I will be known in the Eyes of many Nations, and
<PB N="25" REF="002874_0028_0FE6805D1E563470"/>
they shall know that I am the LORD.</HI>— The Earthquake that <HI>Elijah</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 19.11.</NOTE> saw, was to shew him the Glory and Majesty of GOD.</P>
<P>WE may further observe,</P>
<P>AS the Earthquake is an eminent Demonstration of the Divine Power and Presence: So it is usually a Token of <HI>Wrath</HI> kindled against a Place for the Wickedness of them that dwell therein.</P>
<P>SOMETIMES indeed it has been a Testimony of the <HI>gracious</HI> Presence of GOD with his People, and his Approbation of them. An Instance you have, Acts 4.31. <HI>And when they had prayed, the Place was shaken where they were assembled together; and they were all filled with the holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with boldness.</HI> So the Earthquake that destroy'd <HI>Korah</HI> and his rebel Crew, was a Divine Testimony to <HI>Moses</HI> &amp; <HI>Aaron</HI> the Servants of GOD. And that at the <HI>Resurrection</HI> of CHRIST was de∣sign'd, not only as a Signal to give Notice of that great Event, but also as a Testimony from Heaven to the Majesty &amp; Glory of his Divine Person.—Some∣times Earthquakes have been sent to work Salvation for the Servants of GOD, by destroying their Enemies. The Skies have pour'd down Righteousness; the Earth also hath open'd, and brought forth Salvation. When <HI>Joshua</HI> compassed <HI>Jericho,</HI> we are told, at the Sound of the Trumpet, and the Shout of the People, <HI>the Walls</HI> suddenly <HI>fell down flat</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Josh.</HI> 6.20.</NOTE>, and so the City given up into the Hand of <HI>Israel.</HI> It's thought it was by an Earthquake.— We read, when <HI>Jonathan</HI> and his Armour-bearer assaulted the <HI>Philistines</HI> Garrison, there was a <HI>Trembling in the Host;</HI> the <HI>Garrison</HI> trembled, and the <HI>Earth quaked;</HI> which struck a Terror upon all the People, and threw them into the utmost Confusion; so that the <HI>Multi∣tude melted away;</HI> for they went on <HI>beating down one another</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 14.15, 16.</NOTE>. All imagining each other to be Enemies.
<PB N="26" REF="002874_0029_0FE6805E82CDDD70"/>
I might mention also the Earthquake, which was the Means of the <HI>Apostles</HI> Deliverance out of Prison, and a Testimony from GOD to their Innocence and Di∣vine Mission. Acts 16.25, 26. <HI>At Midnight Paul and Silas prayed, and sang praises unto God: and the Prisoners heard them. And suddenly there was a great Earthquake, so that the foundations of the Prison were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one's bands were loosed,</HI> &amp;c. Thus sometimes the Earthquake is in Token of the Divine Favour to GOD'S People.</P>
<P>BUT usually it is a Visitation in <HI>Displeasure:</HI> a Sign of Wrath gone out from the Lord. Hence it is made the Subject of a Divine <HI>Threatning.</HI> As you may see, if you consult the <HI>Texts</HI> in the <HI>Margin</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> 13.13. So <HI>Chap.</HI> 24.17, &amp;c. <HI>Amos</HI> 1.2.</NOTE>.— And hence the dreadful <HI>Effects</HI> of Earthquakes are declared in Scripture the Tokens of GOD'S Wrath. Isa. 5.24, 25. <HI>Because they have cast away the Law of the Lord of Hosts, therefore the Anger of the Lord is kindled against his People; and He hath stretched forth his Hand and smitten them; and the Hills did tremble, and their Carcasses were torn in the midst of the Streets.</HI> This might be the Earthquake that <HI>Zechary</HI> speaks of, in the days of <HI>Uzziah</HI> King of <HI>Judah</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Zech.</HI> 14 5.</NOTE>. Which tho' the Scriptures give no particu∣lar Account of; yet 'tis probable it was a very awful and destructive one. Hence this Prophet says, <HI>Ye shall flee like as ye fled from before the Earthquake in the Days of</HI> Uzziah. <HI>Amos</HI> dates his Prophecy <HI>two Years before the Earthquake,</HI> which in all pro∣bability was the same: <HI>And he said,</HI> <Q>The Lord will roar from <HI>Zion;</HI> the Habitations of the Shep∣herds shall mourn, and the Top of <HI>Carmel</HI> shall wither. Hear ye, saith the Lord; In the day that I shall <HI>visit the Transgressions of Israel upon him,</HI> I will also visit the Altars of <HI>Bethel,</HI> and I will smite the <HI>Winter-house</HI> with the <HI>Summer-house,</HI> and the Houses of Ivory shall perish. I saw the Lord standing upon the Altar, and He said, Smite

the Lintel of the Door, that the Posts may shake, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q>
This was the Threatning and Burden of the Lord by the Prophet <HI>Amos.</HI> Now <HI>Isaiah</HI> &amp; <HI>Zechariah,</HI> who were younger Prophets, may hint to us the woful <HI>Accomplishment</HI> of it in the forequoted Passages <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Josephus,</HI> the celebrated <HI>Jewish</HI> Historian, informs us of some awful Circumstances of this Earthquake in the Days of <HI>Uzziah.</HI> It happen'd upon Occasion of the <HI>King's</HI> going into the Temple to burn Incense upon the Golden Altar. <HI>Azariah</HI> and the Priests oppos'd him, saying, <HI>It appertaineth not to thee,</HI> Uzziah, <HI>but to the Priests.</HI> This kindled the King's Wrath, and he bid them be quiet upon the Peril of their Lives. Immediately on this Menace there follow'd a terrible <HI>Earthquake,</HI> which rent the Roof the Temple; and tore down great part of a Mountain at some small distance from the Town, which rolling along choak'd up the high-ways, and co∣ver'd the King's Gardens all over with Rubbish. [L' <HI>Estrange</HI>'s Josephus, p. 570.] Very probably it was then <HI>GOD smote the Winter-house</HI> and <HI>Summer-house,</HI> and <HI>the Bodies of Men were torn to pieces in the midst of the Streets,</HI> while they fled from the falling Moun∣tain. — So we are told, in the Earthquake in <HI>Sicily,</HI> (which happen'd in the Year 1693,) Great Rocks were thrown down from the Mountains every where, and great Numbers of People perish'd in the Houses, which were beaten down by them in their way, as they rolled along. And in the terrible Earthquake at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> which is fresh in the Memory of many among us, we are told, The Mountains were so thrown in Heaps, as to destroy the Roads; and one of them splitting, and falling down into level Land, drove all the <HI>Trees</HI> before it, intirely ruin'd a Plantation, and bury'd the Inhabitants. — <HI>Lowthorp</HI>'s Philosoph Transact.

<P><PB N="31" REF="002874_0034_0FE68068756A06C8"/>IN a word, Sometimes Earthquakes have occa∣sion'd great <HI>Sicknesses,</HI> and pestilential Distempers, by spreading abroad those poisonous Vapours which infect the Air, and by innumerable Accidents, which often fall out at such Times. <NOTE N="{inverted †}*" PLACE="foot">A very great Mortality follow'd the Earthquake at <HI>Jamaica.</HI> Vast Numbers that escaped that, soon after died of a <HI>malignant Fever;</HI> from Change of Air▪ Want of dry Houses, of warm Lodgings, proper Medicines, and other Conveniences: They died miserably in Heaps.

<P><PB N="32" REF="002874_0035_0FE6806FE00F5DF0"/>THUS I have enumerated some of the principal Effects of Earthquakes. And now they must needs appear to us very terrible Judgments, being so fatal many times, and so extensive in their injurious Influ∣ences. Surely these, if any Events at all, are mani∣fest Indications of GOD'S holy Displeasure. In the Case of the Israelites that perish'd in the Gainsaying of <HI>Kore,</HI> the Earthquake was expresly declared to be the Vengeance of GOD upon them. By this all Israel shou'd <HI>know that those Men had provoked the Lord,</HI> (Numb. 16.30.)</P>
<P>I shall only add here, That Earthquakes may be Tokens of Divine Anger, when yet no Execution is done, no Injury receiv'd. It is not to be doubted but <HI>that</HI> was so, which attended the <HI>Crucifixion</HI> of our blessed LORD. The Scripture-Story informs us not of any <HI>Death</HI> or Damage occasion'd by it to any <HI>Per∣son</HI> among all the Multitude that surrounded the Cross of CHRIST. <Q>Some Ecclesiastical Writers indeed say, <HI>That</HI> Earthquake destroyed several Towns in <HI>other Lands</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Near the City of <HI>Naples,</HI> some few Years ago, they dug up a great Piece of <HI>Marble,</HI> with several Figures &amp; Letters engraven round it: which all An∣tiquaries agree is the Pedestal of a Statue erected to <HI>Ti∣berius,</HI> by the <HI>fourteen Cities</HI> of <HI>Asia,</HI> which were flung down (according to the Opinion of many Learned Men) by the Earthquake that happen'd at our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Cru∣cifixion.

The Moun∣tains quaked, because He was wroth, and He threw
<PB N="33" REF="002874_0036_0FE6807002923FB8"/>
down the Rocks in his Anger. He as it were smote his Hands at the wicked Deed, and rent his Gar∣ments at the detestable Blasphemies that accompanied it. He exhibited Himself in the most lively Emblems of Horror &amp; Displeasure. The Sun hid it's head, and the Heavens put on Mourning: the Earth also was horribly afraid, and the very Stones cry'd out, as being burst with Anguish, and flaming with In∣dignation.</P>
<P>IT is the current Opinion of Expositors, that King <HI>David</HI> personated the <HI>Messiah</HI> in several of his Psalms: And some learned Men think he spake prophetically in <HI>Psal.</HI> 18. Particularly in <HI>Ver.</HI> 6, 7. where he says, <HI>In my Distress I called upon the Lord, and cried unto my God: He heard my voice out of his Temple, and my Cry came before Him, even into his Ears. Then the Earth shook &amp; trembled; the Foundations also of the Hills moved, and were shaken, because He was wroth.</HI> It seems to be a prophetical Passage, pointing at the terrible Earth∣quakes that attended the <HI>Death</HI> &amp; <HI>Resurrection</HI> of CHRIST; and may comprehend the many Earth∣quakes that happen'd afterwards, by which GOD poured out his Vengeance upon the wicked <HI>Jews</HI> for murdering the <HI>Messiah.</HI> Tho' in the Verses read, the Earthquake attending the <HI>Crucifixion</HI> of CHRIST, it's probable, may be more particularly refer'd to: and if you compare the History with the Prophecy, you will find an admirable Harmony.</P>
<P>HAD our Saviour died a natural Death, we might have expected such a Miracle wou'd accompany the Fall of so <HI>great a Person</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">History informs us, that <HI>Dionysius</HI> the Areopagite, in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> seeing the <HI>Eclipse</HI> which then happen'd (and perhaps feeling the mighty <HI>Earthquake</HI>) cried out with a loud Voice, "Either the World is dissolving, or <HI>the GOD of Nature suffering.</HI></NOTE>: and there might have been nothing of the Wrath of GOD expressed in it.
<PB N="34" REF="002874_0037_0FE6807138BD0640"/>
But yet seeing they were <HI>wicked Hands</HI> by which JESUS CHRIST was crucified and slain, we must needs conclude, their Sin procured this terrible Appearance, as a Display of the Anger of GOD at their Wickedness, by which the Earth was so <HI>defiled under it's Inha∣bitants,</HI> as it never was before. 'Twas a wonder the Earth did not instantly open and swallow them up. But GOD in his infinite Patience only warn'd and threaten'd them, without any present Execution. Yet we may well think <HI>Fury came up into his Face,</HI> when his Beloved SON was thus despis'd and re∣jected of Men: His <HI>Lips were full of Indignation,</HI> and he made his glorious Voice to be heard; tho' as yet He shewed not the lighting down of his holy Arm to destroy.</P>
<P>THIS then may serve to <HI>interpret</HI> to us the Lan∣guage of Providence in the late awful Dispensation <HI>among our selves,</HI> and may convince us that GOD hath been in his <HI>Anger</HI> marching through our Land, cry∣ing to the City &amp; Country, <HI>Alas for all the Abomi∣nations of the House of Israel!</HI> By which <HI>they are crucifying to themselves the Son of GOD afresh, and putting Him to an open Shame!</HI></P>
<P>WHEN we heard the Lord of Hosts roring out of the <HI>Deep,</HI> <NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">In some of our Towns, it is said, Once after they had felt a shock of the Earthquake, they saw the <HI>Sea</HI> rise in furious Billows, and heard so hideous and uncom∣mon a <HI>Roar</HI> of the mighty Waves, as made them afraid of a <HI>sudden Destruction.</HI></NOTE>, and felt Him shaking the Earth and our Habitations upon it; was the Lord displeased with the <HI>Sea?</HI> Was his Anger against the <HI>Land?</HI> Was his Wrath against our <HI>Houses,</HI> when they saw Him, and trembled?

a Fire, or brings an Inundation, in his Wrath: But when there is merely <HI>a great Noise</HI> &amp; <HI>Trembling,</HI> without any desolating Effects, even such an Earth∣quake is usually the Visitation of an angry Providence, and carries in it a loud Reproof of the Sins of a Land. It is a Sign 'tis a Land <HI>laden with Iniquity.</HI> Its <HI>Transgressions</HI> are <HI>heavy upon it;</HI> a Burden too heavy to bear. Therefore it groans, it quakes &amp; reels, and is ready to sink under the oppressive Weight. Places have trembled often, before they fell. Re∣peated smaller Earthquakes have gone before to warn the Inhabitants; but these being disregarded, more calamitous ones have in time come upon them, wherein GOD has poured out his Fury like Fire; and it has overwhelmed them as a <HI>Flood</HI> <NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jerusalem</HI> is an Instance, which was visited with Earthquake and great Noise once and again without any considerable Desolations: but they repented not, until at the last a Destruction to the uttermost came, which was partly accomplish'd by terrible Earthquakes▪ as the <HI>Jewish</HI> Historian informs us. <HI>Jamaica</HI> is another Instance. They had Warning by a smaller Earthquake (like those we have seen) 4 or 5 Years before that great Shock, which threw down all their Houses, and sunk so much of the Island.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HENCE then how severely are they to be <HI>reprov'd,</HI> who are <HI>nothing affected</HI> with the awful Dispensation this Land is under!— We can scarce believe what is reported; That some are so harden'd as to treat this Providence with no serious Regard at all, but rather <HI>make light</HI> of it, and laugh at the superstitious Weak∣ness of Those who entertain it with any thing of Sur∣prize, and a trembling posture of Spirit.— O ama∣zing Stupidity!

Go to the Brutes, ye fearless Wretches, and learn of them to fear GOD. <HI>Hear now this,</HI> O foolish People, which have Eyes and see not, which have Ears, and hear not. <HI>Fear ye not me,</HI> saith the LORD! <HI>Will ye not tremble at my Presence;</HI> who have placed the Sand for the Bound of the Sea, and tho' the Waves thereof toss and rore, yet they can∣not prevail!— Receive ye the Pagan Mariners Re∣proof to stupid <HI>Jonah; What meanest thou, O Sleeper!</HI> Arise, call upon thy GOD, if so be GOD will think upon us, that we perish not.</P>
<P>SHALL a Trumpet be blown in the City, and the People not be afraid? Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it? Seek the Lord, lest He break out like Fire; and there be none to quench it. Boast not thy self of to morrow: for thou know∣est not what a Day may bring forth. Be ye not Mockers, lest your Bands be made strong! My Son, Despise not the Chastening of the Lord. It will be the Madness of Folly in you, not to regard the Ope∣rations of the Lord.

<P><PB N="37" REF="002874_0040_0FE68077C8940798"/>SURELY they act a reasonable Part, who are <HI>fearing greatly</HI> because of the Earthquake. 'Tis but a just Comportment with the Voice &amp; Call of Providence. The Dispensation in it's own Nature has a powerful Tendency to work on the Minds of Men by way of Conviction and Terror, and to beget a trembling frame of Spirit, from the apprehension of an invisible Al∣mighty Hand shaking the Earth. And it is what GOD expects, that we tremble at his Presence, and fear his Wrath at such a time. He says now unto <HI>New-England,</HI> "Surely thou wilt fear Me; Thou wilt receive Instruction: So thy Dwellings shall not be cut off.</P>
<P>HENCE we may look upon it as a <HI>Token for Good,</HI> that such extraordinary Impressions are made upon the Hearts of many by this awakening Dispensation. For by the Terrors of the Lord Men are often per∣suaded and prepared to turn unto GOD, and believe on the Name of <HI>JESUS.</HI> The Evangelists tell us, That <HI>all the People</HI> which came to see the Cruci∣fixion of our Lord, when they saw the Earthquake, and the awful Things that came to pass, <HI>smote on their Breasts and returned</HI> — sorrowful and in a very pensive frame, deploring the wicked Fact, which had been committed, and trembling for fear of the dread∣ful Judgments they cou'd not but apprehend were coming upon them. Thus their Hearts were in a manner soften'd, and made susceptible of the Impressi∣ons of sanctifying Grace. It's thought the Con∣victions they now were under, prov'd happy Prepa∣ratives to the good Work which was afterwards wro't upon them, when <HI>several Thousands</HI> together were converted by <HI>Peter</HI>'s Preaching.— So in the Case of the <HI>Jaylor,</HI> (Act. 16.26, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) the sudden and terrible <HI>Earthquake</HI> which open'd the Prison-Doors, and set loose his Prisoners, was the Occasi∣on of his Awakning and Repentance.</P>

worship, fear and serve GOD: lest the Lord swear in his Anger concerning our Houses, as in the Case of <HI>Eli,</HI> 1 Sam. 3.13. <HI>I will judge his House for ever, for the Iniquity, which he knoweth; because his Sons made themselves vile, and he restrained them not.</HI></P>
<P>AND O that our <HI>Civil</HI> RULERS may be awaken'd by the late awful Dispensation, to a greater Appli∣cation, Activity &amp; Zeal in the performance of their respective Trusts: to <HI>stand up for GOD,</HI> against the workers of Iniquity; and set themselves to be a <HI>Terror,</HI> not to good Works but <HI>the evil!</HI> As the LORD has arisen, and lifted up his Arm, to take hold on Vengeance: So let our Magistrates be Imitators of GOD, in taking Hold on Judgment, and not <HI>bear the Sword in vain.</HI> Trim your Lamps, to search out all punishable Iniquity: and whet the Weapons of Justice, not only to brandish them over the heads of Sinners, but to <HI>execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil,</HI> without partiality or connivence. You are GOD'S Ministers, and he requires you to be attending continually upon this very thing. Let none content themselves with the Honour of being in Authority; but let all make Conscience of discharging the Duties of their Post, to preserve Peace and Order, and pro∣mote Virtue in the midst of us. We beseech you, Sirs, in the Name of CHRIST, that in the first place you will every one labour to set the brightest <HI>Exam∣ple</HI> of all Morality and Religion, (and blessed be GOD, we have at this day so many worthy Examples in the Magistracy) that you may drive away Iniquity with the Rebukes of your grave Countenances, and in your unblemish'd Lives speak Conviction and Terror to bold Transgressors. O let there never be Reason for Complaints, that any of those who <HI>make</HI> the <HI>Laws,</HI> or that are solemnly <HI>Sworn</HI> to <HI>maintain</HI> them, do themselves put a slight upon them in any Instance, and so expose their Authority to the Con∣tempt of others. Particularly as your faithful Moni∣tor this Day I will take Leave to exhort and intreat, that those in places of Power and Rule will carefully
<PB N="40" REF="002874_0043_0FE6808119443F18"/>
avoid all <HI>Tavern-Clubs,</HI> or unnecessary Resort to <HI>Public Houses;</HI> as you wou'd not have Fellowship with the un∣fruitful Works of Darkness: and even as you wou'd pay a just Regard to the good <HI>Laws</HI> of the Province; which as they exclude <HI>Town-Dwellers</HI> the Tavern after nine o' Clock in the Night, and forbid them to sit drink∣ing idly there at any time; so they likewise do for∣bid <HI>all</HI> (except <HI>Travellers</HI> and Persons upon <HI>Bu∣siness</HI> or some <HI>extraordinary</HI> Occasions) even to <HI>continue</HI> there above the space of <HI>one Hour:</HI> and whosoever continues there above the Space of one Hour <HI>(other than as aforesaid)</HI> is liable to a <HI>Fine,</HI> or to be set in the <HI>Stocks</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Law-Book,</HI> Chap. 8.</NOTE>.— Now then, my Fa∣thers and Brethren, after our own Laws have thus put such Discountenance and Disgrace upon all un∣necessary frequenting public Houses, will any in the Magistracy, claim as a Privilege, the Indulgence of being there <HI>One</HI> Hour, upon any pretence whatever! Let it not be!</P>
<P>BUT then as you are to be Examples of all Virtue and good Order, so you ought to <HI>employ all the Powers</HI> of your respective Offices to <HI>promote</HI> the same in all Places where you come: and being your selves Pat∣terns, you may do this with the better grace and ad∣vantage.</P>
<P>O let us beseech you, Sirs, to stir up your selves and call upon one another to bear Testimony against Vice and Immorality, in a faithful, zealous, and resolute Attendence to the Law, in all it's important branches. By the wisdom of the Legislature, we have a Body of Laws excellently calculated to the publick Weal: Let it not be complained that they are not put in <HI>Exe∣cution.</HI></P>
<P>MAY the Terror of the <HI>Earthquake</HI> immediately awaken all in places of Power, from an affecting view of the great Necessity of a Reformation, to labour the Subduing of the many provoking Evils, which make the Land tremble!</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="002874_0044_0FE6801756BFF598"/>MUST it not be said to thee, O <HI>Boston!</HI> to thee O <HI>New-England!</HI> as the Prophet said to <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Ezek. 16.49. <HI>Behold, this was the Iniquity of thy Sister</HI> Sodom: <HI>Pride, Fulness of Bread, and Abundance of Idleness was in her and in her Daughters.</HI> And can there be nothing done to correct the Extravagance of the Times, to reform the Idle and Dissolute! Surely the Judgments of GOD call this People to lay aside their <HI>vain</HI> Ornaments, to retrench the Superfluities of their voluptuous Ta∣bles, and to awake out of that criminal Sloth &amp; indo∣lent trifling way of spending their precious Time, which Multitudes are guilty of.</P>
<P>IS it not said, Wo to the City that is <HI>filthy and polluted!</HI>— Now are there not abominable Fornica∣cations and Adulteries committed in this Land? And might not more be done for the Restraint of this grow∣ing Wickedness!</P>
<P>IS it not said, Wo to the <HI>oppressing</HI> City! And is there not much of Oppression, Extortion, and unrighteous Dealing practised among us? May it not be complain'd, <HI>All the foundations of the Earth are out of Course!</HI> And is it not the Language of Providence, <HI>How ye down Trees, and cast a Mount against</HI> Jerusalem: <HI>This is a City to be visited; She is wholly Oppression in the midst of her!</HI> GOD seems to be smiting his Hands at our dishonest Gain. May not the Earthquake, which came as <HI>a Thief</HI> in the Night, put us in mind of the Cousenage and clan∣destine Villanies (as well as the secret Impurities) which are practised by so many!</P>
<P>AND when we have felt the Earth tremble, and our Houses <HI>reel to &amp; fro</HI> like a <HI>drunken Man</HI> (as the Prophet gives us the elegant, but reprochful Comparison) shou'd it not mind us of the wicked <HI>Intemperance,</HI> which threatens (among other foolish and hurtful Lusts) to drown us in Perdition, unless there be some speedy and very powerful Stand made!</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="002874_0045_0FE645FC2BA14408"/>Furthermore, Is not <HI>Truth</HI> fallen in our Streets; and the Spirit of <HI>Falsehood</HI> reigning, to a scandalous degree among us? What Promise-breaking, Back-biting, Lying and Slandering, do Multitudes live in the practice of; who give their Mouths to Evil, and their Tongues frame Deceit!— Is there not also much of profane <HI>Swearing</HI> and <HI>Cursing;</HI> by reason of which the Land mourneth! How do Multitudes among us in the most impious and barefac'd manner rend and tear the sacred Name of GOD! The Earth surely might well <HI>rore</HI> at this: and 'tis a wonder it was not <HI>rent;</HI> that it did not open it's mouth, and swal∣low up the profane Wretches; bury them alive in some dark Recess, and so put their lying and swearing Lips to Silence.</P>
<P>Again, IF we reflect on the particular <HI>Season,</HI> when GOD visited us with the Earthquake, may we not see his Finger pointed at the great and growing Iniquity of <HI>Sabbath-breaking!</HI> O how is the Lord's Day polluted by Multitudes! Are there not many, who very frequently, if not habitually, do neglect the public Worship? Are there not many who prostitute the Day (or part of it) to worldly Business or vain Recreations! How general a Custom is it, for Men to continue exercising their Trades, or pursuing their Diversions, till late in the Evening <HI>before</HI> the Sab∣bath, and to spend the Evening after in Idleness and Vanity: by which means our blessed LORD, the Lord of the Sabbath, is defrauded of a valuable Por∣tion of holy Time, and the good Ends of sacred Or∣dinances and Duties very much defeated! Well then may the Earth tremble, and the Heavens at this be astonish'd.— There are good and wholesome Laws providing sutable Remedies in these Cases: But how little are they regarded, and what a Coldness in many to have them put in Execution!</P>
<P>Moreover Is there all due Care taken to encourage and support the <HI>Ministry</HI> of the Gospel in this Land, in some Towns especially?— If GOD'S Altar be starv'd, and there be a Robbing of GOD in Tithes
<PB N="43" REF="002874_0046_0FE68077E69C8580"/>
and Offerings; has He not said, I will even send a Curse upon you! — Now if our Rulers <HI>perceive that the Portion of the</HI> Levites <HI>hath not been given them,</HI> have they not as much Power, as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> of old, and are they not equally concern'd &amp; oblig'd to apply some effectual Remedy? — Neh. 13.11. <HI>Then I contended with the Rulers, and said, Why is the House of God forsaken?</HI> "Why are the <HI>Levites</HI> starv'd out of it? Why did you not take Care, and prevent this? It is requir'd of Christian Magistrates, that they use their Power to oblige Ministers to do <HI>their</HI> Duty, and <HI>People</HI> to do theirs. And when they don't do what they can to encourage and sup∣port the Worship of GOD, they will have a great deal to answer for. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN a word, Is there not a deplorable Neglect of <HI>Family-Order</HI> among us? How little is there of Religion and Government in many Houses? And does not the late terrible Shaking of our Houses ad∣monish us of our Family-Disorders and Neglects?— Shou'd not our Rulers then exert themselves for the Reformation of these things! Might not some further publick Laws be enacted for that End; to oblige Parents and Masters to keep better Hours and better Orders in their Houses; and to restrain Children and Servants from many vile Practices!— Are there not some Houses among us, that are mere Nurseries of Lewdness and Debauchery, or Receptacles of Thefts and Robberies, or full of scandalous Strifes and Brawlings? And might not more Pains be taken to subdue and reform such disorderly vicious Families!</P>
<P>THUS I have mention'd some of those Sins, which make the Times perillous, and expose the Land to shaking Dispensations. O that by the awful Hand of GOD stretched out, our Rulers may be excited to lay these things more to Heart; and not only as Christians, to sigh and cry in secret places for all
<PB N="44" REF="002874_0047_0FE64605B8B3EA38"/>
these Abominations, but also as publick Ministers of Justice, to be open and swift Witnesses against them, both by Word and Deed! May our Ma∣gistrates put on Zeal, with <HI>Phinehas,</HI> and contend like <HI>Nehemiah,</HI> in this day of Degeneracy, that they may turn away Wrath from the Congregation!</P>
<P>AND O that the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the <HI>Word</HI> may be quickened, directed, and assisted of GOD, to improve <HI>their</HI> Opportunity! It seems to be a happy Season for the Ministry of the Word. After Men have been so terrify'd by <HI>Earthquake</HI> and <HI>great Noise,</HI> what more likely to melt and charm their Souls, than the <HI>still small Voice</HI> of the preached Gospel? The Lord make us wise to win Souls; give us the tongue of the Learned, that we may know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary: and make us faithful, that we may cry aloud in the ears of Sinners, and spare not; warning every Man, and reproving with all long-suffering! The Lord pour out his Spirit upon us, that we may give ourselves wholly to these things, and unto Prayer!</P>
<P>AND O that the People of GOD in our several <HI>Churches</HI> may be rouzed and quicken'd to the Duties of Self-Examination, Humiliation and Prayer, Eccle∣siastical Discipline, Brotherly Watch and Admonition, Peace and Union!</P>
<P>LET the Churches inquire into their State and Circumstances; examine how they observe the Feasts and Sabbaths of the Lord; whether they keep the Ordinances, as they have been delivered to them, and the Faith as it was once delivered to the Saints?— May not the Earthquake admonish us of the Spirit of <HI>Giddiness</HI> and <HI>Wavering,</HI> that is to be found in Multitudes of Professors! May we not speak of them in the Language of the Prophet, <HI>They are drunken, but not with Wine; They stagger, but not with strong Drink!</HI> — O look to your selves, that ye lose not those things which ye have gained. Be watchful, and strengthen the Things which remain, that are ready to die. So stand fast in the LORD, my

dearly Beloved. Remember, O <HI>New-England,</HI> how thou hast received and heard; and hold fast &amp; repent.</P>
<P><HI>REMEMBER from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first Works:</HI> Or else, saith the Lord, I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy Candlestick out of it's place, except thou repent. Let us fall down upon our Faces in penitent Humiliations before GOD for all our Errors and Miscarriages, for all our Impenitency, Unbelief, Ingratitude and unfruitfulness under the Gospel; and let us besiege the Throne of Grace with our ardent Cries, that GOD wou'd pardon all our Iniquities, and turn away from us the fierce Anger, which we have seen such awful Tokens and Prognosticks of.— And let the Churches study a <HI>Reformation</HI> of all that is amiss among them. <HI>Purge out the old Leaven,</HI> that you may be a new Lump. Keep the Feast, not with the Leven of Hypocrisy, or the Leven of Malice, Ha∣tred and Variance: for which things the Wrath of GOD cometh down upon a Land. Neither let any go in the way of <HI>Korah,</HI> with a spirit of murmuring and gainsaying; lest the Earth open it's mouth for them also, while they are muttering Perverseness against <HI>Moses</HI> &amp; <HI>Aaron</HI> the Lord's Servants.— But keep the Feast with the unleavened Bread of Sincerity &amp; Truth. And let such as neglect the Table of the Lord, spee∣dily prepare and come. <HI>Let a Man examin himself;</HI> and so let him eat of that Bread, and drink of that Cup. Let us judge our selves for our faulty Neglects, and our unworthy Receivings. If we would judge our selves, we should not be judged.</P>
<P>IN fine, May <HI>all the People</HI> of the Land lay to heart the terrible Visitation we are under! The surprising Earthquake and subterraneal Thunder was GOD'S <HI>Voice</HI> crying to the Town and Country. O let us hear attentively the Noise of his Voice, and listen to the Sound that goeth out of his Mouth. The Lord hath spoken in his Holiness: O hear ye the shaken Rod, and who hath appointed it. Hear ye now what the Lord saith: hear, O ye Mountains, the Lord's Controversy, and give Ear, ye little Hills! for the
<PB N="46" REF="002874_0049_0FE6807A56163878"/>
Lord hath a Controversy with his People, and He will plead with <HI>Israel.</HI></P>
<P>SEARCH out the <HI>Lessons</HI> writ upon the present Dispensation: and be instructed, O <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> saith the Lord, lest my Soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a Land not inhabited.</P>
<P>WE shou'd learn how <HI>great</HI> &amp; <HI>terrible</HI> a GOD we have to do with; and therefore make Him our Fear and our Dread.— We shou'd learn our absolute Need of an <HI>Interest</HI> in CHRIST; out of whom GOD is a con∣suming Fire: To Him therefore we shou'd fly for Refuge, and plead his Sacrifice as the Atonement for the Congregation.— We shou'd learn our intire <HI>De∣pendence</HI> upon Divine Providence for Preservation and all outward Comforts; and adore Him as the GOD of our Life.— We shou'd learn the <HI>Instability</HI> &amp; Vanity of the <HI>World;</HI> how foolish it is to set our Affections on Things here below, and what an uncertain Foun∣dation they stand upon, who build their Confidence on the Earth, and place their Happiness in it's Enter∣tainments.—We should learn what a <HI>mutable</HI> World we live in, and how happy they that are got beyond the Reach of the Accidents of Time, and settled in a King∣dom which cannot be mov'd. — Moreover, We are admonish'd of a <HI>Day of Judgment</HI> coming, when our glorious Lord will arise to shake terribly the Earth; will rise up suddenly, and by his immediate Hand dis∣solve the whole Frame of Nature. And seeing we look for such things, we should give Diligence to make our Calling and Election sure, that if that Day of the Lord shou'd hasten and come upon us suddenly, we may nevertheless have Boldness and not be affrighted at the Noise of a dissolving World.</P>
<P>IN a word, We shou'd learn the <HI>Evil</HI> of SIN, which brings down Divine Judgments on the Earth, and throws Nature into the terrible Convulsions and Disorders we behold. — We shou'd inquire, <HI>What meaneth the Heat of this Anger?</HI> We shou'd study the Grounds of GOD'S Contention with us: and endea∣vor that all provoking Evils may be put away from the midst of us. We shou'd judge ourselves for our Sins
<PB N="47" REF="002874_0050_0FE6807A75C726A0"/>
as the moral procuring Causes of the Earthquake, and be found repenting in Dust &amp; Ashes.—We shou'd con∣sider how unworthy we are of the Earth for our Ha∣bitation, and admire the Riches of Divine Patience and Clemency in yet reprieving us from Death and Hell. Are we not <HI>as Brands pluck'd out of the Fire!</HI></P>
<P>O let us realise the sparing Mercy and preventing Goodness, mix'd with the awful Dispensation we are passing under. If GOD had pleas'd, He could have by his Earthquake shook down our Houses, and bury'd Multitudes in the Ruins. He cou'd have caused the Earth to burst open, in many Chasms, and swallow Men up alive. He cou'd have kindled a Flame in his Anger, and pour'd out fatal Streams of liquid Fire to consume us: or have made the Earth sink under our feet, and drown'd us all in one moment under a deso∣lating Flood of mighty Waters: as He overthrew <HI>Sodom,</HI> and as He destroy'd the Cities &amp; Villages of <HI>Sicily, Jamaica,</HI> and other parts of the World. —But He has only appointed over us <HI>Terror,</HI> without Con∣sumption: Blessed be his Name! — As great as the Miseries we were expos'd to so great is our Deliverance. Sing, O ye Heavens, for the Lord hath spared his In∣heritance: Shout, ye lower parts of the Earth: Break forth into Singing, ye Mountains, O Forrest, and every Tree therein: for the Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.</P>
<P>IN former days this Land has felt the gentle Shocks of Earthquakes, one after another. GOD has visited us once and again; but in Tenderness, remembring Mercy in the midst of Wrath. The Language of his Providence is that, <HI>How shall I give thee up!</HI> How shall I make thee as <HI>Admah?</HI> How shall I set thee as <HI>Zeboim;</HI> which the Lord overthrew in his Anger and in his Wrath?— O let us consider the great Deli∣verance we have receiv'd, and never forget the Haz∣ards we have passed thorow. GOD hath shewn us the Riches of his Patience &amp; Compassion, together with his Power and Majesty. He hath shown us what He <HI>cou'd</HI> do, and hinted to us what <HI>we</HI> deserve. O that by the Terrors of the Lord we may be persuaded:
<PB N="48" REF="002874_0051_0FE645FC2023BCC8"/>
and by his Goodness led to Repentance! Let us attend to the Voice of his monitory Rod: that his Long-suffering may be Salvation to us. As our Psalmist exhorts, <HI>O come let us worship and bow down; let us kneel before the Lord our Maker. For He is our God, and we are the People of his Pasture &amp; the Sheep of his Hand: To Day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</HI></P>
<P>O that Such as are secure may be awaken'd; and that such as are under Convictions may be brought to a true Repentance! GOD has come, not to slay us, but only to affright us, and call our Sins to Remembrance. Let us reflect on the Motions and Thoughts of heart within us, when we were alarm'd by the Noise and Terror of the late melancholy Night. Did not Con∣science rouze up, and begin to do it's Office, in accu∣sing and condemning! O let us cherish the Impressi∣ons, retain the Thoughts of those distressing Hours, and improve the same to a thorow Repentance and Reformation. Beware that you don't relapse into Se∣curity: <HI>Quench not the Spirit.</HI> Satan and his Instru∣ments will be busy to cancel any good Impressions be∣gun upon you: but resist the Devil, forsake all vain Company, and fly the Inticements of an evil World. Strive to enter in at the strait Gate. Diligently at∣tend the Means of Grace. Watch &amp; pray, that ye enter not into Temptation. And exhort one another daily, lest any Man be hardned thro' the Deceitfulness of Sin. Often recollect the Vows, which your Lips uttered, in that tremendous Season, when your Soul was in Distress: and fail not to perform your Vows.</P>
<P><HI>AMEND now your Doings,</HI> saith the Lord: and trust not in lying Words. Be not deceived: GOD is not mocked. Beware of Hypocrisy. It is a melancholy Account we have, Psal. 78.34, 36. <HI>When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned, and enquired early after God. Nevertheless, they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.</HI> And tho' <HI>we</HI> do the like, GOD may (as in their Case) yet have Compassion, and not stir up all his Wrath, speedily to make an utter End
<PB N="49" REF="002874_0052_0FE68081696D3980"/>
of us. But verily his Patience will not last always. Abused Patience will sooner or later turn into impla∣cable Fury.— <HI>Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart,</HI> that the Lord, He is GOD in Hea∣ven above, and upon the Earth beneath: with whom is <HI>terrible Majesty.</HI> The Earth shook &amp; trembled; the Hills also moved &amp; were shaken, because He was wroth. He hath lifted up his Voice, and spoken to us from the invisible Caverns below, in the most awful Accents of holy Displeasure. Hear this, ye old Men, and give Ear, all ye Inhabitants of the Land: Hath this been in your days or even in the days of your Fathers? Tell ye your Children of it, and let your Children tell their Children, and their Children another Generation: that they may fear GOD, and not forget the Works of the Lord, but keep his Commandments, that it may be well with them.</P>
<P><HI>THEREFORE also now,</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>Turn ye even to ME with all your Heart,</HI> and with Fast∣ing, and with Weeping, and with Mourning; and <HI>rent your Heart,</HI> and not your Garments, and turn unto the Lord your God: for he is gracious &amp; merciful. <HI>Who knoweth if He will return, and repent Him of the</HI> Evil! Only acknowlege thine Iniquity, that thou hast trans∣gressed, O backsliding <HI>Israel!</HI> So I will not cause mine Anger to fall upon you, saith the Lord. Circum∣cise therefore your Heart to the Lord, and be no more stiffnecked. O let us hear his Voice <HI>to Day,</HI> while it is called to day, and turn at his Reproof. — That's the Call of GOD; Repent and turn, lest I come quickly, and smite the Earth with a Curse, that shall devour the Inhabitants. O let us make Haste to put far away all Iniquity from our Tabernacles, that our Houses may be safe from Fear. Let us immediately labour to get Sin purged out of our Hearts and Lives, and let us cry mightily to GOD, that Salvation may be nigh to us, and Glory dwell in our Land. <HI>It is Time to seek the</HI> LORD, till He come and rain Righteousness upon us. It is <HI>high time</HI> to awake out of Sleep. Awake unto Righteousness, and sin not.— So shall we in the most effectual way <HI>flee from the Earthquake,</HI> and obtain

Lengthning out of our Tranquillity. But if by these things we will not be reformed; if we will not hear, and if we will not lay it to Heart, to give Glory to GOD, we have Reason to fear He will punish us <HI>yet seven times more,</HI> as He did his People <HI>Israel</HI> of old</P>
<P>THEREFORE our Text warns us in those terms; <HI>To day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts, as in the Provocation, and the day of Temptation in the Wilderness: when your Fathers tempted me; unto whom I sware in my Wrath, that they should not enter into my Rest.</HI>—Agreably the Apostle observes, 1 Cor. 10.5, 6. <HI>But with many of them God was not well pleased: for they were overthrown in the wilderness. Now these things were our examples, to the intent we should not lust after evil things, as they also lusted.</HI> So the Prophet, Jer. 7.12. <HI>But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it, for the wickedness of my people Israel.</HI> In like manner it may be said, Go to <HI>Antioch;</HI> Go to <HI>Smyrna,</HI> and to <HI>Laodicea,</HI> and to <HI>Sar∣dis;</HI> and see what an incensed GOD has done to them for all their Wickedness. And let us fear the like Doom. Places they were once famous for the Christian Pro∣fession, but growing degenerate were finally destroy'd by terrible <HI>Earthquakes.</HI> O let not <HI>New-England</HI> be highminded, but fear: be zealous, and repent. To come nearer home, I might say, Go to <HI>Lima,</HI> in the Southern Part of <HI>America</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">The Spaniards have met with terrible Blows in this City once and again by Earthquakes.

GOD may cause the Calamity to rise up a <HI>second time,</HI> and then give it a Commission to destroy; except we repent. Verily there is no Contending with GOD, as <HI>Job</HI> speaks,
<PB N="52" REF="002874_0055_0FE680894CABD5E0"/>
<HI>Job</HI> 9.4, 5, 6. To day then if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts; lest there come upon us sud∣den Destruction without Remedy.</P>
<P>BUT if utter Desolation hasten not upon the Land, by literal Earthquakes, and other the like Judgments; yet have we not Reason to fear sad Revolutions, <HI>Church</HI>-quakes &amp; <HI>State</HI>-quakes, that shall swallow up all our dearest Privileges! Have we not felt repeated <HI>Shocks</HI> already, that have made the very Foundations tremble under us, and threatned a terrible Dissolution! Are there not many that <HI>hate our Zion,</HI> who cease not cry∣ing, Rase it, Rase it to the very foundations! And is not the Number of <HI>New-England</HI>'s best <HI>Friends</HI> less∣ning every day! How is the ancient Stock of pious praying Christians, and faithful, active, zealous Ser∣vants of the Publick dying off apace? [Among others I wou'd here mention two <HI>late</HI> Instances, one in the Ma∣gistracy, and the other in the Ministry; the Honourable Col. <HI>John Otis,</HI> of his Majesty's Council, and the Rev. Mr. <HI>Samuel Danforth,</HI> Pastor of the Church in <HI>Taun∣ton,</HI> who having in their various Stations faithfully serv'd their Generation, are now fallen asleep in JESUS.] And of those rising up, how few are there possessed with with the <HI>first</HI> Spirit of <HI>New-England!</HI> Are we not daily degenerating from the Principles and Zeal of our primitive Times! Is not Apostasy growing upon our Churches in regard of Faith, Worship, Discipline and Conversation! Are there not those Sins abounding a∣mong us, which might justly provoke GOD to take away his Kingdom from us, to tear in pieces our hap∣py CHARTER, and visit us with Persecution &amp; Oppres∣sion! And does not a Spirit of Contention &amp; Perverse∣ness, the Love of the World, and licentious Customs, threaten to ruin us, in our best Interests, by a natural and powerful Efficacy!</P>
<P>O let these Reflections awaken all that love <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to tremble for the Ark of GOD, and to plead for the City of our Solemnities. Hear the Exhortation, with which I now conclude, Isa. 62.6, 7. —<HI>Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not silence; And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make Jerusalem a praise in the Earth.</HI></P>
