<HEAD>To the Reader.</HEAD>
<P>THE late surprising and awful <HI>Event</HI> of Provi∣dence wherein the <HI>most High GOD</HI> hath pas∣sed before us, in an amazing <HI>Earthquake,</HI> of vast <HI>extent</HI> and in a <HI>degree</HI> of uncommon ter∣ror; whether we consider the greatness of the <HI>Shock,</HI> or the great <HI>noise</HI> that attended it; is the occasion of <HI>publishing</HI> the following <HI>Sermons,</HI> tho' not of the <HI>preach∣ing</HI> them all.</P>
<P>For within the <HI>month</HI> wherein the <HI>earthquake</HI> came I had preached <HI>twice</HI> to my People from this awful <HI>Subject, The Judgments of Providence in the hand of CHRIST:</HI> to which I added <HI>three</HI> Sermons more, in a proper and serious <HI>Application</HI> of the Subject to so singular and uncommon a <HI>Providence;</HI> wherein I have consider'd the <HI>Earthquake in the hand of CHRIST,</HI> and what <HI>his voice to us</HI> is in that teaching and affecting Dispensation. These <HI>five</HI> Sermons I have here re∣duced into <HI>three,</HI> only pointing the <HI>Reader</HI> where he may divide the contracted <HI>double</HI> Sermons, for the use and benefit of his houshold.</P>
<P>It is only the <HI>Christian Improvement</HI> of this awak∣ning Providence that I have here attended to, and the <HI>Reader</HI> is desired to expect no other; leaving the Enquiry into the <HI>natural Causes</HI> of Earthquakes, and the <HI>History</HI> of them, to a <HI>better Hand,</HI> which has pro∣mis'd to gratify the <HI>Publick</HI> therewith.</P>
<P>Something of the <HI>Scriptural history</HI> of the <HI>Earthquake</HI> is here given, and the peculiar honour of these <HI>Dis∣courses</HI> is their sincere Aim to render unto CHRIST the glory of this tremendous <HI>Judgment,</HI> and of our <HI>Preservation</HI> in it.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="002853_0004_0FE67810CED7E958"/>
To HIM therefore let these <HI>Meditations</HI> be sacred (however mean and unworthy to be offer'd to his glorious <HI>Name</HI>) according to the Commandment and declared Will of the FATHER to us, Who <HI>hath com∣mitted all judgment to the SON, that all men should honour the Son even as they honour the father.</HI></P>
<P>Our LORD has visited us this year as he told <HI>Ariel,</HI> the City where <HI>David</HI> dwelt, that it should be <HI>visited of the LORD of hosts with Thunder, and with Earthquake, and with great Noise; with Storm and Tem∣pest, and the flame of devouring Fire.</HI></P>
<P>The great noise of <HI>thunder</HI> we have often heard, I hope with trembling and godly fear, as <HI>Elihu</HI> did in his day. And we have scarce ever heard more of it in a <HI>summer,</HI> than in this which is now past. But we never heard <HI>the great noise of an Earthquake</HI> till in the late <HI>calm and still night,</HI> when it came rushing and roaring on us in hollow subterraneous <HI>thunders,</HI> the best and truest Comparison I can make of it.</P>
<P>As for <HI>the flame of devouring fire</HI> we had very much of it in the sultry and parching extream <HI>heat</HI> of the summer, of a long continuance, for many weeks to∣gether. This <HI>burning drought</HI> penetrated far into the earth, so that many wells and springs of water fail'd that never had before. Some have been ready to ask, Whether <HI>this</HI> might contribute any thing, as a natural cause in the hand of CHRIST, to the Earth∣quake that has follow'd upon the rains and cold of <HI>Autumn,</HI> which suddenly set in after so uncommon and long a <HI>heat?</HI> But when we search (as I think we must) <HI>very deep</HI> after the probable natural Cause of so <HI>great</HI> a shake, I am constrained to drop this burning <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on the <HI>surface,</HI> had it been more than it was.</P>
<P>In the midst of this <HI>sultry</HI> heat, and in the <HI>Evening</HI> after a very <HI>parching</HI> day, (<HI>August.</HI> 1.) the Heavens broke out into a continued <HI>blaze</HI> of flame and <HI>roar</HI> of thunder, horrible to behold and hear, for two or three hours together. The <HI>flashes</HI> of lightning were almost
<PB N="v" REF="002853_0005_0FE64683A0EFB3A0"/>without intermission, and consequently the <HI>peal</HI> of thunder perpetual in our ears; As if <HI>the heavens being on fire were dissolving and passing away with a great noise, and the earth also with its works were to be burnt up.</HI> Yet the lightning did little or no hurt that I heard of.</P>
<P><HI>Forty six</HI> days after this, namely on the 16th. of <HI>Sep∣tember,</HI> the same <HI>Almighty power</HI> in like majesty and terror came down to us in the <HI>whirlwind</HI> and in the <HI>storm,</HI> and the <HI>clouds were the dust of his feet; He made darkness his secret place, his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.</HI> The furious <HI>wind</HI> shiver'd the mighty <HI>oaks</HI> and the strong <HI>elms,</HI> tore off their vast <HI>branches</HI> as a man plucks a <HI>twig</HI> with his hand, and turn'd up the wide <HI>roots</HI> of innumerable trees with all their <HI>turf</HI> cleaving to them into the air; a new and strange <HI>spectacle</HI> of desolation in the fields and woods. Yet it pleas'd GOD again to preserve our dwellings and our lives that tempestuous day and night; Only a family or two suffer'd by loss of <HI>life</HI> or broken <HI>bones,</HI> who had the due and hearty Sympathy of their spared nei'bours.</P>
<P>And now that after all <HI>this flame, thunder and tempest,</HI> at the end of <HI>forty three</HI> days more, <HI>October.</HI> 29. we should be visited with a tremendous <HI>Earthquake,</HI> has fill'd the year with so many remarkable <HI>threatnings of judgment</HI> as were never known among us before in so short a compass of time. Truly the LORD has passed by in the <HI>great and strong wind,</HI> in the <HI>flame</HI> and <HI>earth∣quake;</HI> and what should follow but <HI>his small and still voice</HI> in his preached Word? if we might be so happy and honoured of him as to interpret his <HI>Providences</HI> aright, and bring his mind and will in such a clear and strong light, as by the blessing of the HOLY SPIRIT to make sutable and saving impressions upon our souls.</P>
<P>There is but one <HI>doub,</HI> in a way of <HI>Speculation,</HI> that I would here propose, and in a few words offer to re∣solve: namely,</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="002853_0006_0FE64683B32D74A8"/>
Whence might it come to pass, that the late <HI>shock</HI> of the Earth was <HI>felt,</HI> and the <HI>noise</HI> or roar of the earth <HI>heard,</HI> in all the very <HI>distant</HI> places to which it reach'd, so far as we can yet learn, <HI>at</HI> or very near <HI>the same moment of time?</HI></P>
<P>I see not how <HI>this</HI> can be accounted for, but by sup∣posing the <HI>whole Shake</HI> to come from <HI>one single blast</HI> or stroke, in some mighty <HI>Cavern</HI> at a vast <HI>depth</HI> in the earth: Where let us suppose a vast body of prepared <HI>sulphurious matter,</HI> like that from whence the <HI>lightnings and thunders</HI> in our air proceed; or if you please com∣pare it to that prodigious preparation of man on earth <HI>Gun-powder:</HI> Let us imagine a <HI>quantity</HI> hereof suffici∣ent to shake a <HI>Circle</HI> of our Earth of <HI>five hundred miles diameter;</HI> which I take to be much <HI>within</HI> the mea∣sure of the <HI>Circle</HI> shaken by our late Earthquake, which reach'd from our most <HI>northern</HI> bounds as far southward as <HI>Philadelphia:</HI> Say now that this prodigi∣ous quantity of prepared sulphureous matter <HI>take fire</HI> all at once, and <HI>blow up,</HI> tearing to pieces a vast part of the <HI>Intrails</HI> of the earth, but chiefly discharging it self into the mighty <HI>Deep</HI> below, while at the same time it must also strike dreadfully <HI>upwards,</HI> and <HI>heave</HI> at once the earth of such a circle as is before named, and set it all a <HI>trembling</HI> near the same instant of time: But then in the <HI>extremities</HI> of the Circle the <HI>shake</HI> will naturally be <HI>less,</HI> and toward the <HI>center</HI> of it more; and the <HI>noise</HI> of the blast below will naturally <HI>accompany</HI> the shock it gives, and be <HI>heard</HI> every where in that instant that the shake is <HI>felt,</HI> and in <HI>proportion</HI> to the shock the noise will be in one place and another.</P>
<P>This is my plain and short <HI>reasoning</HI> upon the point, and I am glad to find I am <HI>not alone</HI> in it; supposing the <HI>Letter from Marblehead</HI> to mean the same thing, when it says, <Q>I am ready to conclude that the shocks were <HI>general</HI> and at the <HI>same</HI> time, and that <HI>their direction was from beneath upwards, and not along the surface of the earth.</HI></Q> That this <HI>opinion</HI> is right
<PB N="vii" REF="002853_0007_0FE677E61B9E8E80"/>seems very evident from the nature of the thing. For both the <HI>shock</HI> and <HI>sound</HI> being almost at the <HI>same</HI> time in <HI>every</HI> place, where it was felt or heard at all, "the <HI>direction</HI> must be from <HI>beneath</HI> upwards, and not along the <HI>surface</HI> of the earth, as our <HI>senses</HI> at the time would have perswaded us.</P>
<P>And accordingly in the <HI>extremity</HI> of the Circle sha∣ken, for instance at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the shake and rumble we hear was but <HI>small.</HI> Moreover, In <HI>proportion</HI> to the vast Circle shaken, I conclude we must conceive of the <HI>depth</HI> below where the <HI>blow</HI> was given; and al∣so of the <HI>force</HI> of the blow it self, as well as of the vast <HI>quantity</HI> of matter'<HI>fir'd</HI> and blown up: For a shake of such <HI>dimension</HI> and to such a <HI>degree,</HI> is most easily accounted for from a <HI>fiery blast.</HI></P>
<P>Every <HI>Generation,</HI> I suppose, may look for Earth∣quakes in this <HI>Continent;</HI> and in every <HI>Century</HI> some very <HI>great</HI> shocks may be reasonably expected. <HI>Sixty five</HI> years are now passing since the Land was shook much as it was now: The <HI>pewter</HI> fell off the shelves, the <HI>joice</HI> wro't in and out of the mortices as the houses rock'd, the <HI>lids</HI> of warming-pans were flung up; <HI>pas∣sengers</HI> on the way were unable to keep their feet and sat down while the ground <HI>heav'd</HI> them: Something also of the like noise and <HI>rore</HI> of the earth accompani∣ed <HI>that</HI> shake.</P>
<P>Many <HI>smaller</HI> shakes have been felt since. <HI>Greater</HI> and more dreadful ones may be expected, as the <HI>Coun∣try</HI> fills more with <HI>sin.</HI> For the <HI>Great GOD</HI> foresees all the <HI>Events of nature</HI> in its course, and the <HI>Sins of places</HI> and people in their course and increase; and in his most wise and just <HI>Government</HI> of the World they exactly <HI>tally</HI> one with the other, to his infinite glory and ever∣lasting praise from the <HI>Intellectual</HI> world.</P>
<P>We may conceive that every such <HI>blast</HI> from within the bowels of the Earth, very much <HI>thins the crust</HI> be∣tween the <HI>surface</HI> whereon we live and the <HI>Abysse</HI> of fire below. And the more <HI>this</HI> is shatter'd and <HI>broken</HI> by
<PB N="viii" REF="002853_0008_0FE64685972402E0"/>blasts within, the nearer is the <HI>sinking</HI> of the earth, and the <HI>eruption</HI> of fire, here and there, by shakes that are to come: The shakes that are <HI>still</HI> felt in divers places, with the rumbling noise accompanying them, seem to me to proceed from the <HI>fall</HI> of certain huge <HI>pieces</HI> of the earth, which the <HI>first</HI> great shake had loosned, and the furious <HI>flames</HI> have since prey'd on and torn down. By all of which <HI>they</HI> gain more and more upwards. At the Contemplation of these things our <HI>flesh</HI> may well <HI>tremble because of GOD,</HI> and we should be <HI>afraid of his judgments.</HI></P>
<P>The visitation by <HI>Earthquakes</HI> this year seems direct∣ed more especially to <HI>Great Britain</HI> and its <HI>Dominions.</HI> The accounts from thence tell us of <HI>Earthquakes</HI> there the last <HI>July,</HI><Q>preceeded by a <HI>mighty noise</HI> like thun∣der at a distance; the houses shook, the walls of gardens rock'd like a cradle, the tops of several chim∣neys fell; many left their houses in great fear think∣ing them falling on 'em, and others were toss'd in their beds.</Q> What the <HI>import</HI> of these things may be to a sinful (otherwise happy) <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and to these <HI>Provinces;</HI> Whether our holy <HI>Protestant Religion</HI> or our <HI>Civil Liberties</HI> are to be shaken; as GOD only knows, so may He avert the <HI>Omen.</HI> Our part is <HI>to make sup∣plication to our Judge.</HI></P>
<P>To be sure the great <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD to us in our <HI>Preservation</HI> ought greatly to <HI>affect</HI> us, and never be forgotten. I have endeavoured to give <HI>this</HI> a due place and consideration in the following <HI>Discourse;</HI> and the <HI>Subject</HI> naturally led to it, the <HI>Judgment</HI> and the <HI>Sal∣vation</HI> coming from the same hand of our <HI>Lord Redeemer.</HI></P>
<P>That <HI>He may sanctify</HI> to us all his Dispensations, every <HI>Mercy</HI> and every <HI>Judgment,</HI> and bless this <HI>humble Offering</HI> to that <HI>saving</HI> effect, is the <HI>Prayer</HI> of the un∣worthy <HI>Author.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Judgments of Providence in the hand of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Ezekiel X. 2.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And he spake unto the Man clothed with linnen, and said, Go in between the Wheels, even under the Cherub, and fill thy hand with coals of fire from between the Cherubims, and scatter them over the City: And he went in in my sight.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>FOR the understanding these <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>awful</HI> words we must know, 1. who the <HI>Man</HI> is here spoken to, <HI>clothed with linnen;</HI> 2. <HI>who</HI> speaks to him; and then 3. consider the meaning of the <HI>thing</HI> commanded him and done by him.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Man</HI> here spoken unto, <HI>clothed with linnen,</HI> is no other than the Man CHRIST JESUS; the eternal <HI>Son of God</HI> appearing in fashion as a <HI>man;</HI> that <HI>Son of man</HI> whom the FATHER hath made <HI>strong</HI> for himself, and who is now set down on the right hand of GOD, our <HI>High priest</HI> and <HI>King,</HI> both to make <HI>intercession</HI> and also to execute <HI>judgment.</HI></P>
<P>We read of the same <HI>Man</HI> before presiding over the executioners of the wrath and judgments of God; <HI>Chap.</HI> 9.2. <HI>And behold six men came from the north, every
<PB N="2" REF="002853_0010_0FE64685A6962898"/>man with his slaughter weapon in his hand, and One man among them was cloathed with linnen.</HI> HE was not one of the <HI>six,</HI> but they were ministers and servants under <HI>Him,</HI> and obeyed his orders. Here are <HI>six Angels</HI> the ministers of the GOD MAN Mediator, hearkening to the voice of his word, to do his pleasure while he performs the whole counsel and purpose of GOD.</P>
<P>In the <HI>ninth Chapter</HI> this glorious <HI>Person</HI> clothed in linnen is the minister of <HI>mercy,</HI> v. 4. employed to go thro' the city and to <HI>set his mark on the men that sighed and cried for the Abominations done therein.</HI> In this <HI>tenth Chapter</HI> he appears as the minister of GOD's <HI>vengeance,</HI> as will presently be seen. And these <HI>two</HI> are indeed the summ of those <HI>Offices</HI> which CHRIST executes as <HI>Mediator</HI> between GOD and man: He effectually <HI>saves</HI> the Elect of GOD from sin and wrath, and then he executes <HI>judgment</HI> on all the rest, who will not be saved from sin by him.</P>
<P>CHRIST appears here in his <HI>priestly</HI> Office, <HI>clothed in linnen;</HI> for the Priests of old were so clothed; the <HI>white linnen</HI> being significant of <HI>purity and holiness;</HI> their <HI>profession</HI> thereof, and their <HI>bonds</HI> to it. The spotless holiness and shining righteousness of CHRIST is the thing here represented. As we read, Revel. 19.8. <HI>The fine linnen is the righteousness of the saints.</HI> But here the <HI>linnen</HI> clothing is the righteousness of the Holy JESUS himself. He clothes believers in his <HI>own</HI> righteousness, and makes them <HI>priests to GOD,</HI> and they shall walk with him <HI>in white.</HI></P>
<P>CHRIST is here a <HI>priest upon his throne,</HI> the judge and the priest together. This is the <HI>Man,</HI> the <HI>sinless</HI> man, more than a man.</P>
<P N="2">2. This Man is <HI>spoken</HI> to: <HI>HE spake unto the Man clothed with linnen and said.</HI> It is <HI>God the Father,</HI> the supream <HI>Majesty,</HI> who here speaks to CHRIST, as his <HI>Servant</HI> whom he upholds, his <HI>Elect</HI> in whom his
<PB N="3" REF="002853_0011_0FE677E78296A8A0"/>heart delighteth. The voice and words came from the <HI>Throne,</HI> says the first verse. <HI>Then I looked</HI> (says the Prophet) <HI>and behold in the firmament that was above the head of the Cherubims, there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a THRONE; and HE spake unto the man clothed in lin∣nen,</HI> &amp;c. That is, the <HI>enthroned MAJESTY</HI> in the heavens, HE spake: <HI>GOD THE FATHER Almighty</HI> he spake to his Only begotten <HI>Son,</HI> the <HI>Man CHRIST JESUS.</HI> And now</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us hear the <HI>things said,</HI> and let him that heareth understand: <HI>Go in between the wheels, even un∣der the cherub, and fill thine hand with coals of fire from between the cherubims, and scatter them over the city.</HI></P>
<P>You must know that the day of the destruction of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was now at hand, even the <HI>burning</HI> of the City and Temple by the army of the king of <HI>Baby∣lon. Zedekiah</HI> was now king of the remnant of <HI>Judah,</HI> his reign was short and his ruine at hand; and the destruction of the city <HI>by fire</HI> is the thing here repre∣sented and foretold. <HI>Burnt</HI> it was by <HI>Nebuzaradan</HI> captain of the guard, but <HI>who</HI> did it? why CHRIST the king and judge of the church and of the world. The <HI>Man</HI> the ordained <HI>judge,</HI> he goes in between the <HI>wheels;</HI> for he turns them all, high and dreadful as they are; <HI>He fill'd his hands with coals of fire from be∣tween the cherubims,</HI> for they had profaned his altars and his temple; and then he <HI>scattered the coals</HI> over the defiled city and sanctuary, which was once <HI>Holi∣ness to the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>It was CHRIST's own hand did it: The flaming brands in the hand of the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> were the coals in <HI>his</HI> hand: <HI>They</HI> did but perform <HI>His</HI> holy word and will and dreadful pleasure. They were the <HI>staff of his indignation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002853_0012_0FE677D6941F6DA0"/>
Finally observe, how readily and fully CHRIST executes the will of the FATHER in them whom he <HI>saves,</HI> and in them that <HI>perish.</HI> Has the FATHER said to Him, "<HI>Go set a mark</HI> on such and such to save them? He does it: Ezek. 9.11. <HI>And the man clothed with linnen reported the matter, saying, I have done as thou hast commanded me.</HI> Or doth the FATHER say to CHRIST, "Go set the city in flames? He does it; The <HI>Prophet</HI> saw him go; <HI>He went in</HI> (says he) <HI>in my sight.</HI> See also the 6 and 7 <HI>verses.</HI></P>
<P>Now the thing to be remarked is, That the <HI>burning coals,</HI> the dispensation of <HI>Judgments,</HI> are put into <HI>the hand of the Man clothed with linnen, and scattered</HI> by Him: Which teaches us this <HI>Doctrine</HI>— "That the present Judgments of Providence are put into the hand of CHRIST, and come forth from his hand.</P>
<P>But when I say the <HI>Judgments</HI> of Providence, it can't be meant in exclusion of the dispensations of <HI>Mercy</HI> and Grace; which as they do equally belong to the kingdom of <HI>Providence,</HI> so the administration of them is equally in the hand of CHRIST. Nor when we say that the dispensation <HI>both</HI> of mercy and of judgment is from the hand of the LORD JESUS, can this be understood in exclusion of, or derogation from the FATHER and the HOLY GHOST, as if the kingdom of <HI>Providence</HI> were not always in their glorious hand: For the glorious <HI>Persons</HI> in the GODHEAD are one in essence and in operation. And altho' there is a special <HI>Mediatorial Kingdom</HI> com∣mitted to the SON, which takes in the whole Admi∣nistration of the kingdom till the consummation of all things, when the whole <HI>mystery</HI> of GOD shall be finished; yet the <HI>FATHER worketh hitherto</HI> in and by the SON, and so doth the HOLY GHOST with and from Him; and this in a way of <HI>Sovereign</HI> dominion.
<PB N="5" REF="002853_0013_0FE677E7AA773740"/>1 Cor. 12.11. <HI>All these worketh that one and selfsame SPIRIT, dividing to every man severally as He will.</HI></P>
<P>The SPIRIT of GOD is therefore represented as guiding all the motions of <HI>Providence,</HI> together with the SON OF MAN, in the visions which <HI>Ezekiel</HI> had of the <HI>living creatures</HI> and of the <HI>wheels,</HI> Chap. 1.12, 19, 20. <HI>The living creatures</HI> (i. e. the Cherubims or Angels, ministers in the executing of the Divine will) <HI>went straight forward whither the SPIRIT directed them; and the wheels</HI> (the course of nature) <HI>followed them: Whithersoever the SPIRIT went, they went; for the SPIRIT of life</HI> (so the Hebrew is) <HI>was in the wheels.</HI> So that we do not exclude the agency, power and sovereign influence of the HOLY SPIRIT, in the judgments or mercies of Providence, when we say that these are put, into the hand of CHRIST; For the <HI>Man clothed with linnen</HI> is in the <HI>midst</HI> of the same Wheels together with the <HI>SPIRIT of life;</HI> And while the <HI>SPIRIT lifts up the wheels,</HI> and the <HI>Cherubims</HI> act under his immedi∣ate direction; <HI>lo above the firmament</HI> appears the <HI>Throne,</HI> and the likeness of a <HI>Man</HI> upon it, with a <HI>rain-bow</HI> over his head, and <HI>fire</HI> from his loins down-ward. Ezek. 1.27, 28.</P>
<P>Having premised this <HI>guard</HI> on the sacred <HI>Truth</HI> be∣fore us, I come now to the <HI>proof</HI> and illustration of it, in the plainest manner I can. And because it is a Truth known only by <HI>Revelation,</HI> and capable only of <HI>Scripture</HI> proof, I shall therefore argue

I. I argue from plain Scripture <HI>affirmations.</HI> And such I take the following places to be: <HI>Psalm</HI> 2. <HI>I have set my King upon my holy hill of Zion: I will declare the decree; the Lord hath said unto me, Thou art my SON, this day have I begotten thee: Ask of me and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession: Thou shalt break them with a rod of Iron, thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potters vessel. Be wise now therefore O ye kings, be instructed ye judges of the earth: serve the LORD with fear and rejoice with trembling: Kiss the SON, lest he be angry and ye perish from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little: Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</HI> The sum of this <HI>Psalm</HI> is CHRIST's dominion over the kingdoms of men and his <HI>judgments</HI> on them. <HI>In vain</HI> do the <HI>rulers</HI> or <HI>people</HI> of them <HI>take counsel together, and rage against the LORD, and against his ANOIN∣TED: He shall speak to them in his wrath and vex them in his sore displeasure.</HI></P>
<P>The like to <HI>this</HI> is the 110. <HI>Psalm: The LORD said to my LORD, set thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool: The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion; rule thou in the midst of thy ene∣mies: — Thou art a priest</HI> and king <HI>for ever,</HI> at my <HI>right hand,</HI> and shalt <HI>strike thro' kings in the day of</HI> thy <HI>wrath;</HI> shalt <HI>judge among the heathen,</HI> and <HI>wound the heads over many countries.</HI> Here the judgments of Providence are put into CHRIST's hand, in words as plain and full as can well be utter'd.</P>
<P>At his first manifestation to <HI>Israel, John</HI> the <HI>baptist</HI> told them that <HI>his Fan was in his hand:</HI> Matth. 3.12. And He himself said to them <HI>For judgment am I come.</HI> Luke 12.49. <HI>I am come to send fire upon earth; and what will I if it be already kindled?</HI> In what a <HI>sove∣reign</HI> manner is this said? as indeed having the <HI>coals</HI> of fire in his hand, to <HI>scatter</HI> them where he would. Agreeably he said again, <HI>All power is given to me in
<PB N="7" REF="002853_0015_0FE677EED94F8DA0"/>heaven and on earth.</HI> This power must take in that of all the present <HI>judgments</HI> of Providence. As he told the <HI>Jews,</HI> John. 5.22, 27. That <HI>the FATHER had committed all judgment to the SON, and given him authority to execute judgment,</HI> now and hereafter, <HI>because he was the Son of man.</HI> The same thing is in effect said over and over to the <HI>Christian Churches</HI> in the second and third <HI>Chapters</HI> of the <HI>Revelations</HI> of St. <HI>John.</HI> All these are plain <HI>Affirmations</HI> that the judgments of Providence are in the hand of CHRIST, and come forth from his hand.</P>
<P N="2">II. We have <HI>visionary Representations</HI> of this in the Book of God. My text is <HI>such,</HI> wherein is represen∣ted to the <HI>Prophet</HI> under the form of <HI>a Man clothed in linnen with his hands full of burning coals,</HI> the burning of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> by the power and vengeance of CHRIST. And in the <HI>first</HI> Chapter of this <HI>Prophecy</HI> we have the same Vision of <HI>a Man upon a Throne,</HI> over and above the <HI>Cherubims</HI> and the <HI>wheels,</HI> with a <HI>rain-bow</HI> of peace over him, and yet <HI>from his loins downward a burning fire.</HI> The <HI>fire</HI> is as much the token of judgment and wrath, as the <HI>rain-bow</HI> is of grace and mercy: And the MEDIATOR cannot be truly represented to us but by <HI>both</HI> together; being equally glorious in his holiness and mercy. He is clad with <HI>zeal as with a cloke,</HI> while he is arrayed in <HI>the garments of salvation.</HI> The fire about the <HI>loins</HI> of the Son of man is alike significant of his executing judgment, as the <HI>coals in his hand.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> saw him in the form of <HI>a Stone cut out of the mountain without hands,</HI> which smote the <HI>Image</HI> of Idolatry and <HI>brake</HI> it in pieces, and <HI>it self became a great mountain and filled the whole earth.</HI> Dan. 2.44.</P>
<P><HI>Zechariah</HI> saw a <HI>Man</HI> riding upon a <HI>red</HI> horse, and he stood among the <HI>myrtle trees</HI> which were in the
<PB N="8" REF="002853_0016_0FE677DD319DF720"/>bottom, and behind him a troop or host of horse, <HI>red speckled and white:</HI> i. e. <Q><HI>Angels</HI> the executioners of God's purposes, whether in a way of <HI>judgment,</HI> noted by the red, or in a way of <HI>mercy</HI> signified by the white, or of a <HI>mixt</HI> nature, noted by the speckled.</Q></P>
<P>But these <HI>visionary</HI> representations of the <HI>Son of man</HI> with the judgments of Providence in his hand are more abundant in the Book of the <HI>Revelations.</HI> So <HI>John</HI> saw him in the midst of the <HI>golden Candlesticks,</HI> his feet as if they <HI>burned in a furnace,</HI> and his voice as the sound of many waters, and out of his mouth a sharp sword.</P>
<P>In the 19. <HI>Chap.</HI> of that book, <HI>John</HI> saw a <HI>Man</HI> upon a white horse, and in righteousness he doth <HI>judge</HI> and make war: His eyes were <HI>as a flame of fire,</HI> and on his head were <HI>many</HI> Crowns, and he was clothed in a vesture dipt in <HI>blood,</HI> and his Name is called the WORD OF GOD: And the <HI>armies</HI> in heaven follow him, clothed in <HI>fine linnen</HI> white and clean, — Lo the <HI>livery</HI> of CHRIST, which the heavenly hosts wear, the executioners of his judg∣ments upon men, such as becomes his righteous and <HI>spotless</HI> administration. As <HI>He</HI> himself is clothed with <HI>linnen,</HI> so his <HI>armies</HI> follow him in fine and <HI>white</HI> linnen. Did you ever hear of an Army so <HI>clothed</HI> before? an army of <HI>Angels</HI> and <HI>holy ones!</HI> of pure and spotless <HI>Spirits,</HI> the ministers of his holy judg∣ments!</P>
<P N="3">III. I come now to give you some <HI>Scripture Instan∣ces,</HI> or <HI>Facts related,</HI> in which CHRIST has appeared unto men with the Judgments of Providence in his hand. And I will take these <HI>sacred Stories</HI> in their <HI>order,</HI> as they ly in the <HI>Book</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> is the Judgment of GOD on wicked <HI>Sodom:</HI> With respect to which we read of <HI>three men</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="002853_0017_0FE677EEFA796410"/>(i. e. two Angels attending CHRIST their Lord and ours) who appeared to <HI>Abraham</HI> in the plains of <HI>Mamre,</HI> as he sat in his tent-door, in the heat of the day. Gen. 18.1. <HI>Abraham</HI> as soon as he saw them ran to meet them, bowing himself to the earth; and perceiving that <HI>One</HI> of the three appeared much the Superior of the other two, he addressed himself in a particular manner, and with a more especial reve∣rence to Him, and said, <HI>My Lord, If now I have found grace in thy sight, pass not I pray thee from thy servant.</HI> It was this <HI>Chief</HI> of the heavenly Guests that said to <HI>Abraham,</HI> v. 10. <HI>I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a Son:</HI> At the hearing of which when <HI>Sarah</HI> laughed, it is said v. 13. <HI>And the LORD said to Abraham, Why did Sarah laugh?</HI> So that this Person was the LORD himself, in fashion as a <HI>Man;</HI> and the other <HI>two</HI> were <HI>Angels,</HI> his servants and ministers, who waited on him in this his descent to our earth.</P>
<P>But there was a more special reason of <HI>His</HI> com∣ing down, and <HI>theirs</HI> with Him, than this visit to <HI>Acraham;</HI> as it presently appeared. For as <HI>Abraham</HI> bro't them on their way after their courteous visit was over, the LORD sent the <HI>two Angels</HI> on their way to <HI>Sodom,</HI> to deliver righteous <HI>Lot</HI> and to <HI>burn</HI> up the cities of that polluted plain; But he stopt short Himself, and told <HI>Abraham</HI> how great <HI>the cry of the sin of Sodom</HI> was before him. Then <HI>Abraham stood before the LORD, and drew near to him,</HI> and made, that most awful and reverend <HI>Intercession</HI> for mercy on the wicked place, which will be famous in the Church for ever; And the LORD granted him his petition till he could not presume to ask further. And then the LORD went his way, and <HI>Abraham</HI> returned to his place.</P>
<P>The mean while the heavenly <HI>Messengers</HI> reached <HI>Sodom,</HI> and found as we all know, and the next morn∣ing
<PB N="10" REF="002853_0018_0FE677DE5F5D4C00"/>the <HI>LORD rained brimstone and fire from the LORD out of heaven.</HI> Gen. 19.24. The <HI>Lord the SON</HI> rained the fire from the <HI>Lord the FATHER,</HI> who worketh by the <HI>Son.</HI> It was not the <HI>two Angels</HI> that rained the fire; No, It was the LORD who stood with <HI>Abraham</HI> when <HI>these</HI> went on their way. It was the <HI>Lord CHRIST,</HI> and He did it from the <HI>FATHER,</HI> who hath committed all judgment to him.</P>
<P>Here now was my <HI>Text</HI> exemplified in the very <HI>letter</HI> of it. Those burning <HI>coals</HI> of fire which were <HI>scattered</HI> over the cities of the valley in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s time, came from the hand of the SON OF GOD, the <HI>Man</HI> CHRIST JESUS. That fiery judgment and desolation, the image of the devouring eternal fire and everlasting burnings, came from those gra∣cious arms which had just before embrac'd <HI>Abraham,</HI> and all his spiritual <HI>Seed</HI> in him. — Go, said the FATHER to Him, <HI>go in between the wheels,</HI> the high and dreadful wheels of my all-governing Providence, and <HI>fill thy hand</HI> with fire and brimstone, and <HI>scatter</HI> it down in a rain of furious <HI>flames</HI> upon the accursed cities, and <HI>burn</HI> them up together: And it was done.</P>
<P>The same hand that burnt <HI>Sodom,</HI> the <HI>Alient</HI> from his Covenant, did afterward burn <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the <HI>holy</HI> City.</P>
<P>This instance alone is a sufficient <HI>Illustration</HI> of my <HI>text,</HI> and a <HI>Demonstration</HI> of the Truth before us, <HI>That the Judgments of Providence are in CHRIST's hand, and come from Him.</HI></P>
<P>But I come to a <HI>second</HI> Instance, which is the Judgment of GOD upon the wicked <HI>Cananites,</HI> the Nations which GOD rooted out by fire and sword before the Children of <HI>Israel.</HI> I might have nam'd the <HI>plagues</HI> that destroyed <HI>Egypt;</HI> for it was CHRIST who appeared to <HI>Moses</HI> in the bush on fire and sent him to <HI>Pharaoh.</HI> But the latter instance of his ap∣pearance to <HI>Joshua</HI> before <HI>Jericho</HI> may suffice, be∣cause
<PB N="11" REF="002853_0019_0FE677F05DADA800"/>the vision which he then had sufficiently tells us from whose hand the destructions of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and all the Judgments on <HI>Israel</HI> in the wilderness, had come. For to be sure the same hand that destroyed the <HI>Cananites</HI> executed also the other judgments.</P>
<P>Now the story of CHRIST's appearing to <HI>Joshua</HI> with the judgments of Providence in is hand, you have in the 5. Chap. v. 13, 14, 15. <HI>And it came to pass when Joshua was by Jerico, that he lift up his eyes and looked, and behold there stood a MAN over against him, with his sword drawn in his hand, and Joshua went un∣to him and said, Art thou for us, or for our adversaries? And He said, Nay, but as Captain of the Host of the Lord am I now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and did worship, and said unto Him, What saith my LORD unto his servant? And the Captain of the Lord's Host said to Joshua, Loose thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place whereon thou standest is holy: And Joshua did so.</HI></P>
<P>Here was a <HI>Man</HI> in form, but <HI>more</HI> than a man, the mighty SON OF GOD himself, who afterward took our <HI>flesh,</HI> and took the name of <HI>Joshua, JESUS,</HI> a <HI>Sa∣viour,</HI> the Captain of our salvation. He is the <HI>Cap∣tain</HI> of all the <HI>Lord's hosts,</HI> in heaven above and on earth below; the King of <HI>Israel,</HI> and <HI>Joshua</HI>'s Lord. He appeared here with a <HI>drawn sword</HI> in his hand, for the <HI>defence</HI> of his Church and for the <HI>slaughter</HI> of their enemies.</P>
<P><HI>Joshua</HI> fell on his face and <HI>worshipp'd</HI> him, as <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> had done in his day with fear and trembling. And because he permitted this, we know certainly that he was no meer <HI>Angel</HI> of God; for then he would have forbid it. But this <HI>Man</HI> in appearance received the profound worship of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and requir'd it from <HI>Joshua,</HI> who fell prostrate before him with aw∣ful reverence, faith, love, attention and ready obedi∣ence; and said unto Him, <HI>What saith my LORD unto his servant?</HI> It became him to fall, and say thus, be∣fore
<PB N="12" REF="002853_0020_0FE677DE87F7AC40"/>the LORD OF HOSTS and Him only. Just as when GOD called to <HI>Moses</HI> out of the <HI>bush,</HI> the ser∣vant <HI>hid</HI> his face, for he was afraid to look upon GOD.</P>
<P>It was the same <HI>GOD of Israel</HI> who now appeared to <HI>Joshua</HI> in the form of a <HI>Man,</HI> and had appeared to <HI>Moses</HI> in the form of <HI>devouring fire.</HI> We know him to be the same GOD, because the same word of com∣mand is given to <HI>Joshua</HI> that was before given to <HI>Mo∣ses, Put off thy shoe from thy foot, for the place whereon thou standest is holy.</HI></P>
<P>Doubtless as soon as <HI>Joshua</HI> heard these words, he knew that it was the same LORD GOD whom his master <HI>Moses</HI> had seen at <HI>Horeb;</HI> even the <HI>GOD of Abra∣ham, of Isaac and of Jacob.</HI> See Exod. 3.4, 5.</P>
<P>But <HI>why</HI> did He now appear to <HI>Joshua?</HI> It was to execute <HI>judgment,</HI> the wrath of God upon the nations of <HI>Canaan,</HI> whose iniquity was now <HI>full.</HI> He threw down the wall of <HI>Jerico,</HI> and commanded it to be <HI>burnt with fire.</HI> A <HI>sword</HI> or a <HI>coal</HI> in his hand is the same thing. He <HI>fill'd</HI> his hand with judgments, and made <HI>Joshua</HI> the dreadful executioner of them upon all the devoted nations of that goodly Country. It is the vision of the same JESUS, Revel. 19.13. <HI>with his drawn sword and vesture dipt in blood,</HI> who will here∣after burn the <HI>Romish Jerico;</HI> when <HI>all the fowl that fly in the midst of heaven shall be called to the supper of the great GOD, to eat the flesh of Kings and the flesh of Captains, and of mighty men, and of all men, both bond and free, small and great.</HI> Then the <HI>Cananites</HI> shall be a second time rooted out with great fury, and the <HI>Church of GOD</HI> a second time shall enter into <HI>rest,</HI> be enlarged and edi∣fied. <HI>Even so</HI> LORD JESUS <HI>come quickly.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Sermon II.</HEAD>
<P>I Go on to a <HI>third</HI> instance or <HI>narrative</HI> of CHRIST's appearing with the <HI>Judgments</HI> of Pro∣vidence in his hand, namely to <HI>Gideon</HI> against the <HI>Mi∣dianites;</HI> Judges 6.12, 13, 14. <HI>And the Angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour! And Gideon said unto him, O my Lord, if the LORD be with us, why then is all this befallen us?</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And the LORD looked on him and said, Go in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites: Have not I sent thee?</HI></P>
<P>The LORD looked on him and said, <HI>HAVE NOT ISENT THEE?</HI> If it had not been for <HI>those</HI> words, we might have taken the heavenly Appearance for a common Angel; but from <HI>them</HI> we perceive plain∣ly that it was the LORD CHRIST himself, the <HI>An∣gel of the Covenant,</HI> the SON OF GOD, in the like∣ness of <HI>man.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>what</HI> came he for? but to <HI>judge</HI> the enemies of his people, and to send <HI>Gideon</HI> to destroy them. He commissioned him in his <HI>own</HI> name; <HI>Have not I sent thee?</HI> and inspir'd him with a look.</P>
<P>The Angel is called JEHOVAH, v. 14. <HI>Jehovah</HI> looked on him. I AM sent him: The same <HI>Angel of the LORD</HI> who called to <HI>Moses</HI> out of the burning <HI>bush.</HI> He put a <HI>lamp of fire</HI> into <HI>Gideon</HI>'s hand and gave him the <HI>Word, The sword of the LORD and of Gideon.</HI>— So in all the <HI>Judgments</HI> on the enemies of the Church, in ancient or later times, there has been the hand of CHRIST.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="002853_0022_0FE67810F19B3FD0"/>
But I come to the <HI>New Testament,</HI> and mean only to <HI>point</HI> unto a few instances, and not enlarge on them.— When our LORD appeared in the flesh, he shew'd that he had the power of <HI>Judgment</HI> com∣mitted to him. The <HI>devils</HI> own'd his power, and beso't him not to <HI>torment</HI> them before their time. The <HI>Gadarenes</HI> saw and felt his power to judge them, when he permitted the <HI>devils</HI> to enter into <HI>the herd of swine,</HI> and the whole herd ran violently down a steep place and perished in the waters. Matth. 8.32. It was an <HI>awful</HI> thing to behold, and and a severe <HI>judgment</HI> they thought upon their country. The <HI>disciples</HI> were so sensi∣ble that the power of judgment rested on CHRIST, that when some look'd with disrespect on him and would not receive him, they ask'd him, <HI>Lord wilt thou that we command fire from heaven to destroy them?</HI> Luke 9.54. But the <HI>Son of man</HI> came not <HI>to destroy men's lives, but to save them.</HI> It was not the time for <HI>Judgment</HI> when he was here on earth. He us'd this power sparingly in the days of his flesh. He <HI>fill'd</HI> his hands with <HI>mercy</HI> and <HI>scatter'd</HI> it about on all the mi∣serable that came in his way.— He had the pow∣er of <HI>life</HI> and <HI>death</HI> while he liv'd here, and when he went to die. He struck none <HI>dead,</HI> but he rais'd some to <HI>life.</HI> He told <HI>Peter</HI> by what kind of death he should glorify GOD; but when <HI>Peter</HI> ask'd, what should be∣come of <HI>John?</HI> the LORD answer'd him in a <HI>sove∣reign</HI> manner, <HI>If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee?</HI></P>
<P>When JESUS was ascended and glorified he shew'd his Church that he exercised the power of judgment over men. The death of <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sap∣phira</HI> was a fearful instance of it: And so was the blow on <HI>Elima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the Sorcerer. Act 13.11.</P>
<P>To name no more, The second burning of <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI> was from the hand of CHRIST. When the <HI>Romans</HI> compassed the City, it was <HI>the sign of the Son of man
<PB N="15" REF="002853_0023_0FE677F56BADA7E8"/>from heaven.</HI> Luke 21.20, 27. Twice hath <HI>the Man clothed with linnen,</HI> the great <HI>High-priest</HI> of the Church and <HI>Judge</HI> of the world, <HI>filled his hand with coals</HI> and burnt <HI>Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P>Let this suffice for the <HI>third</HI> Illustration and proof of the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> That the judgments of Providence are in CHRIST's hand. These are so many <HI>facts</HI> and instances from sacred <HI>story.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. The sacred <HI>Doctrines</HI> of Christianity do infer and confirm this truth. I will name <HI>two</HI> only, and but name them.</P>
<P N="1">1. The GODHEAD of CHRIST infers this, That the judgments of Providence are in his hand. For can he be GOD and this glory not belong to him? According to those words of GOD concerning Him∣self; <HI>Is there any evil in the city and the LORD hath not done it? See now that I, even I am He, and there is no GOD with me! I kill and I make alive, I wound and I heal.</HI></P>
<P>I might argue from the nature, end, extent and duration of the <HI>Mediatorial Kingdom,</HI> that CHRIST is GOD over all, and that all <HI>judgment</HI> is in his hand. The <HI>end</HI> of it is to <HI>recover the elect</HI> of GOD out of that state of <HI>sin</HI> and <HI>misery</HI> into which they fell by <HI>A∣dam</HI>'s transgression, into a state of holiness and hap∣piness for evermore; and to <HI>execute judgment</HI> (the ven∣geance of a holy and righteous GOD) upon all such as will not accept of his offered grace, and submit to the terms of his mercy. Now in order to <HI>this</HI> the kingdom, power and rule put into the <HI>Mediator</HI>'s hand must be <HI>universal</HI> and <HI>everlasting</HI> as to this world of ours: <HI>all</HI> things must be put into his hand and <HI>under his feet,</HI> and he must <HI>reign</HI> till all his enemies are made his <HI>footstool.</HI>— So that whether we consider CHRIST in his GODHEAD, or in his <HI>Mediatorial</HI> dignity and
<PB N="16" REF="002853_0024_0FE6781850552700"/>offices, the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of Providence and the <HI>Judgment</HI> of Providence must be in his hand.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>general Judgment</HI> of the world at the last day being committed to CHRIST, necessarily sup∣poses that the <HI>present</HI> judgments of Providence are so. That CHRIST is the <HI>Judge</HI> of quick and dead at the great Day, is one of the clearest Doctrines of the <HI>New Testament</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See Mat. XXv. 31, 32. Acts XVII. 31. 2 Cor. v. 10. 2 Thess I. 7, 8.</NOTE>: <HI>Then the Son of man shall come in his glory with all his holy Angels, and before him shall be gathered all nations: The Lord JESUS shall be revealed from heaven in flaming fire taking vengeance.</HI> The <HI>present</HI> judgments of Providence are but previous and preparatory for this <HI>final</HI> Judgment. <HI>That</HI> is but the period and consum∣mation of these; the last and most eminent act of his <HI>Regality,</HI> and display of his judicial power; at the close whereof he will surrender the Kingdom to the FATHER. 1 Cor. 15.28.</P>
<P>Indeed these great and sacred <HI>Doctrines</HI> of Christi∣anity, like Truth which is uniform, do infer and prove one another. If CHRIST be GOD he must have the power of <HI>Judgment,</HI> present and future. If he have <HI>this power</HI> truly he is the SON OF GOD, and all men must honour Him even as they honour the FATHER. Again, If the <HI>present</HI> judgments of Pro∣vidence are in his hand, no doubt but he is the <HI>or∣dained Judge</HI> in the last day: And if the <HI>General</HI> judg∣ment be committed to Him, no wonder that the <HI>pre∣sent</HI> executing of judgment is so.</P>
<P>But this for the <HI>Proof</HI> of the Doctrine: I come to the <HI>Application</HI> and Use of it.</P>
<P>And <HI>first</HI> in a more <HI>general</HI> manner I shall <HI>hint</HI> at many things, which in the choice of the Subject I designed to have enlarged on; and then <HI>secondly</HI> I
<PB N="17" REF="002853_0025_0FE677F593099C88"/>shall <HI>enlarge</HI> on a more <HI>particular</HI> Application, which could not be foreseen and designed, but <HI>Providence</HI> has cast it in our way, and loudly calls to it in the late awful and threatning <HI>Earthquake.</HI></P>
<P>We have seen the united Glories of <HI>Majesty</HI> and <HI>Holiness</HI> in the Person and Offices of our <HI>LORD Re∣deemer.</HI> We see that He is GOD and JUDGE, who is our <HI>Saviour.</HI> We see the <HI>evil</HI> (the great evil) of <HI>sin</HI> and <HI>sinners,</HI> from the terrible Judgments and punish∣ments that come from the hand of CHRIST himself. We see that tho' He be <HI>gracious and merciful and abun∣dant in goodness,</HI> yet he will <HI>by no means clear the guilty</HI> and impenitent. We see the <HI>reason</HI> of the great <HI>pati∣ence,</HI> forbearance and longsuffering of GOD to pro∣voking sinners; It is CHRIST the <HI>Saviour</HI> who thus waiteth to be gracious to them, <HI>not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</HI> We see the <HI>safety</HI> of believers in the power of Judgment committed to CHRIST; his <HI>Saints</HI> are in one hand while the <HI>burning coals</HI> are in the other: As he took a most gracious care of <HI>Lot</HI> in the day of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and as he <HI>marked out</HI> the humble and penitent for Salvati∣on in my <HI>context,</HI> before he took a <HI>coal</HI> in his hand for the destruction of the wicked.</P>
<P>If the Judgments of Providence are in CHRIST's hand and come from his hand, <HI>He</HI> then is the object of our <HI>fear,</HI> our <HI>trust,</HI> our <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>praise.</HI> He is to be <HI>feared</HI> for his power, holiness, justice and goodness. <HI>Wilt thou not be afraid of the Power?</HI> He is the <HI>Mini∣ster</HI> of GOD to execute vengeance. It is a <HI>fearful</HI> thing to fall into his living hands. The <HI>forgivness</HI> which is with him commands our <HI>fear,</HI> for it comes to us in the way of glorious <HI>holiness</HI> and justice. Psal. 2. ult. <HI>Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trem∣bling; kiss the SON lest he be angry and ye perish from the way;— Blessed are all they that put their trust in him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="002853_0026_0FE6781871E2D408"/>
Again, We may be sure there is as much <HI>Mercy</HI> in all the judgments of Providence, as is consistent with <HI>rectoral Wisdom</HI> and righteous <HI>Government.</HI> So it was in the judgment of the <HI>old World,</HI> of <HI>Sodom,</HI> of the <HI>Ca∣naanites,</HI> and afterward of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> And so it is in the executions of wrath upon particular <HI>persons,</HI> while in the afflictions of the <HI>Godly</HI> there is abundance of mercy and love.</P>
<P>No wonder that <HI>afflictions</HI> are made <HI>saving</HI> to men, means of grace and holiness to them; since the Judg∣ments of Providence are in the hand of CHRIST. Why else should they be put into the hand of a <HI>holy Saviour,</HI> but to be made blessed and effectual means of <HI>sanctification</HI> and <HI>salvation</HI> to souls?</P>
<P>And no wonder then that we are so strictly requir'd to be <HI>patient, silent, resign'd</HI> in all our afflictions; yea <HI>thankful and joyful</HI> in our tribulations. For can a Be∣liever acting like himself do otherwise, when he con∣siders every dispensation of Providence coming from the same merciful hands of CHRIST, which were once stretched on the <HI>cross</HI> and peirced for his salva∣tion? He that judges and corrects us is the <HI>LORD</HI> that has loved us and died for us; and shall we not with <HI>Aaron</HI> hold our peace? and with <HI>Job</HI> still bless his name?</P>
<P>And if <HI>death</HI> comes to thee or thine, do we not know that the <HI>key</HI> of it is in CHRIST's hand? He will order for the best all that concerns the living and the dying of his chosen and called ones; And what should calm and moderate a Christian's grief like this, "It is CHRIST has done it?</P>
<P>But while it <HI>comforts</HI> us it must also <HI>humble</HI> us, to consider that our many and great <HI>afflictions</HI> come from the hands of CHRIST. How <HI>awful</HI> is it to a belie∣ver on JESUS to think,— Are the judgments of Providence in <HI>His</HI> hand, and I <HI>so</HI> judged by him? O how my LORD convinceth me of sin! how evil am
<PB N="19" REF="002853_0027_0FE677F8460F6440"/>I in his holy eyes! What have I done to offend and provoke a gracious <HI>Saviour?</HI> how vile and odious are <HI>my</HI> sins to him, and should be to me! what a corrupt nature have I that needs all this correction! that I must be <HI>saved so as by fire!</HI> O what would have be∣come of me long ago, if the judgments of GOD had been in any other hand but that of my <HI>Lord RE∣DEEMER!</HI> Therefore it is <HI>that I am not consumed!</HI></P>
<P>Once more O <HI>afflicted</HI> child of GOD, think <HI>whose</HI> hand it is that corrects thee: Is it CHRIST's? then it is more and better than any <HI>friend</HI>'s, or <HI>brother</HI>'s, or <HI>father</HI>'s hand: And wilt thou not be in a quiet <HI>subje∣ction?</HI> shall we <HI>murmur against CHRIST? as they of old murmured, and were destroyed by him?</HI> Alas! <HI>they</HI> knew not <HI>the hand</HI> that proved them, as <HI>we</HI> do: <HI>They</HI> saw him in <HI>types</HI> and shadows, but <HI>we</HI> see him in a <HI>Gospel</HI> light. The <HI>end</HI> of afflictions must be very gracious to <HI>Believers,</HI> and the <HI>fruit</HI> of them happy. CHRIST, whose care and charge <HI>they</HI> are, will see to <HI>this.</HI> It is the very work of a <HI>Saviour</HI> to see to it: <HI>Faithful is he that hath called you, who also will do it.</HI></P>
<P>The majesty and judgment of CHRIST is only <HI>terrible</HI> to unbelieving and <HI>impenitent sinners;</HI> and to them it may well be the more terrible to see <HI>the wrath</HI> in the face of the <HI>LAMB.</HI> For if <HI>He</HI> judge them, who shall pity or save them? GOD has put this <HI>honour and majesty</HI> on him that his <HI>right hand may find out all his enemies, all that hate him:</HI> He will <HI>make them as a fiery oven in the time of his anger;</HI> He will <HI>swallow them up in his wrath, and the fire shall devour them: Be theu ex∣alted LORD in thy own strength, so will we sing and praise thy power.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, In all our approaches to CHRIST in his holy <HI>Institutions</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">This part of the <HI>Discourse</HI> was preached before the <HI>Sacra∣ment</HI> of the LORD's SUPPER.</NOTE>, it should strike us with exceeding
<PB N="20" REF="002853_0028_0FE678199F08C360"/><HI>awe</HI> and <HI>reverence</HI> to consider the Majesty and power, the holiness and justice of CHRIST. <HI>Reverend is his Name!</HI> With him is <HI>terrible majesty.</HI> He struck <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu</HI> with his <HI>fire</HI> from between the <HI>Cherubims.</HI> He will be <HI>sanctified</HI> in them that draw nigh him. He is greatly to be <HI>feared</HI> in the Assemblies of his saints. Keep thy <HI>foot</HI> therefore and prepare thy <HI>heart,</HI> for the place where thou standest is <HI>holy.</HI></P>
<P>Christ expects that we should worship him with great <HI>reverence</HI> because he is our <HI>Judge.</HI> Psalm. 50.1,—5.99.1,—5.</P>
<P>Particularly in the Ordinance of the SUPPER. our <HI>Lord JESUS</HI> exhibits himself to us with the <HI>judgments</HI> of Providence in his hand. Read the awful words of this import, 1. Cor. 11.28, — 32. <HI>But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread, and drink of that cup. For he that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh JUDGMENT to himself, not discerning the LORD's body. For this cause many are WEAK and SICKLY among you, and some SLEEP. For if we would JUDGE our selves we should not be JUDGED. But when we are JUDGED we are chastened of the LORD that we should not be condemned with the world.</HI></P>
<P>You see that the <HI>Apostle</HI> is speaking here of <HI>temporal</HI> judgments, which the LORD inflicted on the <HI>Corin∣thians</HI> for their strange irreverence and carnality in their participation of the <HI>holy Supper.</HI> They eat and drank <HI>not discerning</HI> the LORD's body; therefore they eat and drank <HI>judgment</HI> to themselves. — But what was the <HI>judgment?</HI> why for this cause many were <HI>sick</HI> and <HI>weak</HI> among them. — And yet as to some of them these judgments were <HI>not in wrath,</HI> but in <HI>mercy;</HI> For when they were <HI>judged</HI> they were but <HI>chastned</HI> of the LORD (to humble and reform them) that they should not be condemned with the would. — Wherefore here was CHRIST, even
<PB N="21" REF="002853_0029_0FE677F869FAFA90"/>at his <HI>Table,</HI> as the <HI>King</HI> come in to see his guests, <HI>with the Judgments of Providence in his hand.</HI> But this not to <HI>deter</HI> us from the Ordinance, but to <HI>quicken</HI> us in our preparations for it; and to <HI>encourage</HI> the faithful in their humility and godly fear as they are going thither. Let us behold the Majesty of CHRIST both in his <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Ordinance</HI> together, and be the more <HI>reverend</HI> in our obedience to him and wor∣ship of him.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Here this <HI>Discourse</HI> may be divided.</NOTE></P>
<P>I come now to that <HI>particular Application</HI> of the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> which the Divine Providence leads me into by the terrible EARTHQUAKE, which we have lately felt with so much surprise and consternation. And a very natural <HI>Inference</HI> it is, "That if the <HI>Judgments</HI> of Providence are in the hand of CHRIST and come forth from his hand, Then from HIM came the awful warning and <HI>threatning</HI> of Providence to us in the late fearful <HI>Earthquake,</HI> and to HIM we are indebted for the gracious and merciful <HI>preservation</HI> which we then received. Both the threatning and the preservation came to us from the holy, mighty, terrible and merciful hand of our <HI>Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST. He</HI> shook the earth under us in that awful manner, and to that fearful degree, which we lately felt; and <HI>He</HI> kept it from rending and clea∣ving asunder under us, so that we and all that apper∣tains to us were not swallowed up quick. It should be very <HI>affecting</HI> to us to realize such a <HI>Providence</HI> and dispensation as coming from the hand of CHRIST himself.</P>
<P>HE <HI>the Man clothed with linnen,</HI> with <HI>his hand full of burning coals,</HI> holds the <HI>earth</HI> and the <HI>waters</HI> and the <HI>winds</HI> in the same hand; and this Earth of ours never feels any shock, convulsion or rending by fires, winds
<PB N="22" REF="002853_0030_0FE67819C85210E0"/>or waters, from without or from within it self, but as he orders and appoints the same. We are expresly taught concerning CHRIST, That He <HI>upholdeth all things</HI> by the word of his power, and that by Him <HI>all things consist.</HI> Coloss 1.14,—17. <HI>In whom we have redemption thro' his blood, even the forgivness of sins: For by Him were all things created that are in heaven and that are in earth; visible and invisible; whether they be thrones or dominions, or principalities, or powers; all things were created by him and for him; And He is before all things, and by Him all things consist.</HI> Hebrews 1.1, 2, 3. <HI>GOD hath in these last days spoken to us by his SON, whom he hath appointed Heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds; Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his Person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Universe</HI> is kept together by the SON OF GOD in its proper frame, which it received from Him. "All things <HI>subsist</HI> in their being, and consist in their <HI>order</HI> and dependencies by his will and word. <HI>In his hand are the deep places of the earth, the strength of the hills is his also.</HI> Our earth is held by him in its place and motion, from falling to pieces and return∣ing into the Original <HI>Chaos,</HI> out of which it was bro't into this beauteous and useful order of things. — All the <HI>Elements</HI> are in the hand of CHRIST, and tho' contrary and jarring in themselves, yet there they agree, are still and at peace. <HI>Fire and water, vapour and stormy wind</HI> are in absolute subjection and obe∣dience to him, <HI>fulfilling his word.</HI></P>
<P>—And particularly <HI>Earthquakes</HI> proceed from the <HI>burning coals</HI> in his hand, the <HI>subterraneous</HI> fires and winds belong to these; and he <HI>blows</HI> them up when and where and as he pleases, more or less in the <HI>caverns</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="002853_0031_0FE677FEB2020C38"/>of the earth, and puts all within into a ferment, and the earth heaves and rolls and bursts asunder.</P>
<P>But let us more particularly consider,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The <HI>Threat∣ning</HI> from the hand of CHRIST, and</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. the <HI>Preserva∣tion</HI> from the same glorious Hand.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>THREATNING</HI> of a sudden and amazing destruction to us, in the late most <HI>serene</HI> night (turn'd into a night of darkness and horror to us in a mo∣ment) was from the hand of CHRIST our <HI>Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>I have <HI>prov'd</HI> this in the fore-going <HI>Discourse,</HI> when we little apprehended that CHRIST was coming <HI>suddenly</HI> so very near to our own doors in a horrible <HI>Earthquake.</HI></P>
<P>I told you that it was CHRIST came down to <HI>Sodom,</HI> and rained the <HI>fire (scatter'd the coals)</HI> on <HI>Go∣morrah,</HI> and <HI>Admah,</HI> and <HI>Zeboim,</HI> from the LORD out of heaven. He then also <HI>rent</HI> that ground to pieces on which those polluted <HI>Cities</HI> had stood, and from the <HI>deep</HI> which lieth under he bro't up a <HI>flood of water,</HI> and quench'd the flames that had burnt up the wick∣ed, and turn'd that once <HI>rich and pleasant vale</HI> into a standing <HI>filthy lake,</HI> or <HI>dead sea.</HI> The SON OF GOD came down in the form of a <HI>Man,</HI> (<HI>Abraham</HI> saw Him) and executed that <HI>judgment:</HI> The accursed places <HI>sunk</HI> under his feet, and a flood rose and cover'd them from mortal eyes for ever.</P>
<P>I have also said before how the same <HI>Lord CHRIST</HI> came down in the day of <HI>Joshua,</HI> the fatal day of ac∣cursed <HI>Jerico,</HI> and produced another <HI>Earthquake,</HI> or what was like it and equal to it. <HI>Joshua</HI> saw a <HI>Man</HI> with his sword drawn, but he sound him to be a GOD, with the <HI>fires</HI> and winds of vengeance in his hand, prepared against the enemies of his Church and people. The <HI>fire</HI> he put into <HI>Joshua</HI>'s hand and order'd the devoted City to be <HI>burnt</HI> as soon as he should take it; but the subterraneous <HI>wind</HI> he kept in
<PB N="24" REF="002853_0032_0FE6782119D07988"/>the hollow of his <HI>own</HI> hand, and on the <HI>seventh</HI> day, at the <HI>seventh</HI> compassing the city, the <HI>Priests</HI> blew with their rams-horns, and <HI>the hand of CHRIST</HI> (pro∣bably an <HI>Earthquake</HI> at his special command) <HI>threw down</HI> the walls of <HI>Jerico</HI> in an instant; all but the house of <HI>Rahab,</HI> who <HI>by faith</HI> had received his ser∣vants and protected them.</P>
<P>Thus CHRIST was in the Earthquake at <HI>Sodom,</HI> and at the falling of the wall of <HI>Jerico;</HI> and every <HI>other</HI> shake of the earth, whether before or after those times, have come from the <HI>same</HI> hand.</P>
<P>For instance, The <HI>earthquake</HI> at the time of <HI>Noah</HI>'s flood (if we may so speak) when <HI>the foundations of the great Deep were broken up,</HI> was the Judgment of CHRIST upon the world of the ungodly. It was as much so as the <HI>Conflagration,</HI> or the perishing of the world <HI>by fire</HI> at the last day, will be from the <HI>coals</HI> in CHRIST's hand. The same <HI>Judge,</HI> and the same <HI>Power</HI> and ven∣geance which once came by <HI>water,</HI> will hereafter <HI>be revealed in flaming fire.</HI></P>
<P>The earthquake at <HI>Sinai</HI> was from the presence of CHRIST and his immediate hand, who came down then in the glory of the FATHER, as he will do another day, with his holy <HI>Angels,</HI> in devouring <HI>fire,</HI> and <HI>the mount quaked greatly.</HI> Exod. 20.18. The <HI>Chari∣ots of GOD were twenty thousand</HI> (even <HI>chariots of fire</HI>) thousands of <HI>Angels,</HI> and the LORD was among them. The mountain <HI>melted</HI> before Him, even that <HI>Sinai.</HI> Judg. 5.5. The Apostle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> tells us that it was CHRIST's <HI>voice which then shook the earth,</HI> who has promis'd saying, <HI>Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but heaven also.</HI> Heb. 12.26.</P>
<P>CHRIST was the <HI>LORD GOD of Elijah,</HI> and in the spirit of <HI>that Prophet</HI> his Fore-runner came. He came to his <HI>servant</HI> once in a <HI>whirlwind,</HI> and in an <HI>earthquake,</HI> and in devouring <HI>fire.</HI> You have the repre∣sentation of this fearful thing, I Kings 19.11, 12.
<PB N="25" REF="002853_0033_0FE677FED92CAFD8"/><HI>And behold the LORD passed by, and a great and strong wind rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the LORD; but the LORD was not in the wind: And after the wind an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake: And after the earthquake a fire; but the LORD was not in the fire: And after the fire a still small voice: And it was so, when Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle and went out.</HI> How terrible was this appearance of CHRIST unto his <HI>Prophet?</HI> Who without a divine support could <HI>abide the indignation,</HI> and the tokens of so tremendous a <HI>Majesty</HI> and of the <HI>fierceness of his anger? His fury was poured out like fire, and the rocks were thrown down by him.</HI> (To apply here the majestic words of the Prophet <HI>Nahum.</HI>) —But how is it said, <HI>That the LORD was not</HI> in the rending wind or earthquake? <HI>Who</HI> was in it, but the <HI>LORD</HI> himself? — It means not that the special and immediate hand of CHRIST was <HI>not</HI> therein: No, it only means <HI>"That he did not manifest his presence by any distinct voice</HI> (the small and still voice of a <HI>Man</HI>) in that wind and fire and earthquake, as he afterward did in the <HI>calm</HI> that succeeded. So <HI>Eli∣jah</HI> beheld the glory of CHRIST, in all the <HI>terrors</HI> of an infinitely holy, powerful, offended Majesty; and yet in the <HI>soft</HI> voice of grace.</P>
<P>And thus we have seen CHRIST in one <HI>Earth∣quake</HI> and another in the days of old. And no won∣der then is it that we read of the earth's <HI>quaking</HI> by his power at his <HI>death</HI> and <HI>resurrection.</HI> Mat. 27.51. <HI>The earth did quake and the rocks rent.</HI> Well might they at the horrid deed, and marvailous event, <HI>the Cruci∣fixion of the SON OF GOD.</HI> v. 54. <HI>The Centurion and they that were with him, watching JESUS,</HI> (the <HI>guard</HI> at the execution) <HI>saw the earthquake, and feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the SON OF GOD.</HI> Like trem∣bling seiz'd the guard at his <HI>Sepulchre,</HI> Mat. 28.2. <HI>And
<PB N="26" REF="002853_0034_0FE67821404B5528"/>behold there was a great Earthquake, and the keepers did shake and became as dead men.</HI></P>
<P>In such majesty and great terror did CHRIST die and rise again. The wonder was that the revi∣ling <HI>Soldiers</HI> and hardy <HI>keepers</HI> (or rather their <HI>masters</HI> and rulers) were not swallow'd up alive. But <HI>the Son of man came not to destroy mens lives, but to save them.</HI></P>
<P>When he pleas'd afterward to manifest Himself to his <HI>Disciples,</HI> by shaking the places where they were <HI>worshipping</HI> him or <HI>suffering</HI> for him, it was in token of his <HI>favour</HI> and grace to them. So he came upon them in the day of <HI>Pentecost</HI> in <HI>a rushing mighty wind;</HI> and again, when they had <HI>prayed,</HI> (Act. 4.31.) the place was <HI>shaken</HI> where they were assembled together, and they were again <HI>filled with the HOLY GHOST, and spake the word of GOD with boldness.</HI></P>
<P>So at the prayers and praises of <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> in the <HI>prison,</HI> suddenly there was an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> and the <HI>foundations</HI> of the prison were shaken. Act. 16.30. Happy Earthquake to the <HI>Jailor</HI> and his house! the ordained means of his effectual conviction and con∣version. The impression of that blessed fright never wore off; we charitably think. <HI>He and all his were straightway baptised.</HI></P>
<P>To add no more on this head: In the Book of the <HI>Revelations</HI> we find the great <HI>Events</HI> of Providence and the mighty <HI>changes</HI> respecting the Church of CHRIST and the whole World; which are yet ma∣ny of them in the hand of the MOST HIGH, and in his times to be shewn <HI>who is the blessed and only Potentate, King of kings and LORD of lords;</HI> These changes and events (I say) are represented by <HI>earth∣quakes</HI> as well as by <HI>thundrings and lightnings</HI> &amp;c. CHRIST governs in all these concussions and revo∣lutions, these <HI>literal</HI> or <HI>figurative</HI> earthquakes; with an immediate hand, order and direction.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="002853_0035_0FE67800CBC26BF8"/>
As in the <HI>first</HI> chapter of that <HI>Book,</HI> it is HE THE SON OF MAN that appears in his majesty and great <HI>terror,</HI> in the midst of his Churches, <HI>the seven golden Candlesticks;</HI> to show his <HI>servant</HI> the things that shall be hereafter. And he showed him many terrible <HI>earthquakes,</HI> the emblems of the great and mighty changes which he was bringing upon the earth.</P>
<P>At the opening of the <HI>sixth seal,</HI> Rev 6.12. <HI>John saw a great Earthquake; and the sun became black as Sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood, and the stars fell to the earth, and the heaven departed as a serowl, and every mountain and island moved out of their place.</HI> This was but a <HI>vision;</HI> yet was it a vision of the <HI>true</HI> power of CHRIST, in the kingdom of <HI>nature,</HI> and over the <HI>nations</HI> of men: And it gives us a fair image of his immediate <HI>agency</HI> and rule in all the revolutions in the <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>moral</HI> world. He that <HI>opens the seals</HI> does all the <HI>executions</HI> that follow on them, and sends the <HI>earthquake.</HI></P>
<P>In the 8th. <HI>Chap.</HI> 5. v. we have a place exactly <HI>parallel</HI> to my <HI>text:</HI> It may be worth our while to <HI>compare</HI> them, and see if the <HI>coals of fire</HI> from the altar, and the <HI>earthquake</HI> be not in the same hand. — In my <HI>text</HI> the GOD-MAN, <HI>Mediator,</HI> goes in between the <HI>wheels,</HI> and fills his hand with <HI>fire</HI> from between the <HI>cherubims,</HI> and <HI>scatters</HI> it over the City. — In the 8th. Chap. of the <HI>Revelations,</HI> after the opening of the <HI>seventh seal,</HI> CHRIST comes and stands at the <HI>Altar,</HI> having a <HI>golden Censer</HI> with <HI>much</HI> Incense, which He offers with the <HI>prayers</HI> of all saints before the <HI>Throne.</HI> v. 3. Here is the <HI>Man clothed with linnen,</HI> CHRIST in his <HI>priestly</HI> office and intercessions. But while He is continually doing this for his saints, so his visible Church on earth grows <HI>earthly, worldly,</HI> formal and corrupt; And then (v. 5.) CHRIST (the Angel of the Covenant) takes of the very <HI>same fire,</HI> wherewith he offered up his incense, and <HI>easts of this
<PB N="28" REF="002853_0036_0FE67823B22B27A8"/>down into the earth</HI> in his holy displeasure and indigna∣tion: And what was the <HI>effect</HI> hereof? why imme∣diately <HI>there were voices and thundrings and lightnings and an EARTHQUAKE.</HI> That is to say, <Q>Such manifestations of the <HI>wrath</HI> of GOD, and such swift and terrible <HI>judgments,</HI> as bro't on a mighty change of affairs among men:</Q> Such a change in the face of <HI>Providence,</HI> and on the face of the <HI>Church,</HI> as <HI>earthquakes</HI> often produce on the face of the <HI>earth,</HI> and upon particular <HI>places</HI> of it.</P>
<P>I might turn you to <HI>several</HI> more places in the <HI>Re∣velations of St. John</HI> to the same purpose, but I will point unto <HI>one</HI> only. We read (<HI>Chap.</HI> 16.17.) of the <HI>seventh Angel</HI> his pouring out his <HI>vial</HI> into the air, and there was a <HI>GREAT EARTHQUAKE,</HI> such as was not since men were upon the earth, so <HI>MIGHTY AN EARTHQUAKE</HI> and so great: For the <HI>great City</HI> (the Empire of <HI>Antichrist</HI>) fell into <HI>three</HI> parts, and the <HI>cities of the nations</HI> (which have given their power to the <HI>beast</HI>) fell; and <HI>GREAT BABYLON</HI> came in∣to remembrance before GOD; and every island fled away and the mountains were not found.— A <HI>bles∣sed</HI> earthquake truly! <HI>Lord JESUS</HI> hasten it on! hor∣rible and tremendous to bloody <HI>Rome</HI> and the <HI>papal</HI> powers! more especially to <HI>Italy</HI> that seat of <HI>sodomy</HI> and earthquakes! that land of <HI>sulphur</HI> and subterrane∣ous <HI>fires!</HI>— And why may not its <HI>fall</HI> be by <HI>literal</HI> earthquakes and eruptions of <HI>sulphureous</HI> flames? The fiery hand of CHRIST shall effect this. See the 18. <HI>Chap.</HI> of the <HI>Revelations.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have at large shown that <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> both proper and figurative, are in the hand of our <HI>Lord JESUS CHRIST,</HI> and come forth from his hand.</P>
<P>When therefore in the days of his flesh he spake of <HI>this Sign,</HI> that should foreshew <HI>the Day of his coming;</HI> whether to judge <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> or <HI>Babylon,</HI> or the <HI>World</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="002853_0037_0FE67800F10B9290"/>at the last day; He then sufficiently informed us that <HI>this judgment</HI> was in his hand among others. Mat. 24.7. <HI>There shall be earthquakes in divers places,— the beginning of sorrows.</HI> Luke 21.11. <HI>Earthquakes and great signs from heaven.</HI> He will accomplish <HI>in his times</HI> the things of which he has thus given warn∣ing.</P>
<P>And now to return unto the <HI>Inference</HI> I am upon: From all that we have heard we must needs be con∣vinced and satisfied, That <HI>the late amasing Earthquake which visited us the last Lord's-day in the night was sent to warn us from CHRIST, our king, our lawgiver, our judge and our saviour.</HI></P>
<P>It was <HI>He himself</HI> who threatned to derstoy us, as in a moment. The <HI>earthquake</HI> was from <HI>his</HI> hand, whatever might be the <HI>natural Causes</HI> of it; all <HI>which</HI> are also in the hand of CHRIST, and he works by <HI>them</HI> as he pleases with infinite <HI>foresight</HI> of men and things, and with an unerring direction. We <HI>need</HI> not, we <HI>should</HI> not look any further, (in a <HI>Christian</HI> and practical consideration of the thing, and a religious improvement of it) than the will and government of CHRIST. This becomes us as <HI>Sinners</HI> that would be awakned, and as <HI>Believers</HI> that desire to be humbled and edified; and it behoves us to act the part of <HI>such</HI> rather than of <HI>Philosophers.</HI> They search darkly and uncertainly (however curiously and laudably) into the bowels of the earth and the secrets of nature; but we have the plain <HI>Gospel of CHRIST</HI> to look into, and <HI>see as in a glass the glory of the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the <HI>threatning</HI> of a sudden and a fearful de∣struction coming on us in the terrible earthquake was from CHRIST.</P>
<P N="2">II. Our PRESERVATION from the threatned destruction was from the same glorious HAND. The hand that <HI>shook</HI> the rod over us could have <HI>stricken</HI> with it; he that threatned could easily have executed.
<PB N="30" REF="002853_0038_0FE67823DC8BE838"/>He that set the earth a trembling, held it together under us; the same hand is mighty to save and to destroy. <HI>The LORD is our judge, and he saves it.</HI></P>
<P>There are not <HI>two Principles</HI> or powers, as some of the foolish <HI>Heathen</HI> conceived; the one the author of the <HI>evil,</HI> the other of the <HI>good</HI> that comes to the children of men: No, the living and only true GOD is the author of <HI>both; A just GOD and a Saviour.</HI> Isai. 45.7. <HI>I form the light and create darkness, I make peace and create evil; I the LORD do all these things</HI> — And the <HI>measure</HI> of every judgment is from him; the mo∣deration of it and period to it. He that says to the <HI>sea</HI> hitherto thou shalt come and no further, and here shall thy proud waves be stayed; he says the same to every <HI>overflowing scourge</HI> and overwhelming evil. He <HI>calls to contend</HI> by one judgement and another, and again he says— <HI>This shall not be.</HI> Amos 7.6.</P>
<P>CHRIST sits upon the floods, and rides upon the winds, and reigns King for ever; Absolute, Sove∣reign, irresistible and unaccountable. His blood is the cement that binds the fabrick of heaven and earth together. The earth and its inhabitants were <HI>dissol∣ving,</HI> but he came and holds up the <HI>pillars</HI> of it.</P>
<P>The ground had swallow'd up <HI>Adam</HI> in the day of his fall, if it had not been for this <HI>SEED of the Woman,</HI> this <HI>IMMANUEL, GOD with us.</HI> Our fallen <HI>parents</HI> heard immediately why they did not <HI>instantly die,</HI> and return to their ground; Namely, because there should <HI>a Child be born, a Son be given</HI> them, who should be <HI>the Mighty GOD, the Prince of peace,</HI> on whom the <HI>Government</HI> should be laid. It was for the sake of this glorious <HI>Blessing</HI> in the loins of <HI>Adam,</HI> and be∣cause of an <HI>election of grace</HI> given to Him by the <HI>FA∣THER,</HI> that the <HI>Curse</HI> did not immediately <HI>devour</HI> the sinner and his <HI>earth.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as the <HI>Angels</HI> sinned the heavens <HI>rent</HI> under them, and they <HI>fell</HI> (O mighty fall!) from the height
<PB N="31" REF="002853_0039_0FE67806DD280510"/>of heaven down into the deep Abyss of hell, into the bottomless pit. The reason was, <HI>CHRIST took not the nature of Angels,</HI> took not <HI>hold</HI> of them as they fell. He took the seed of <HI>Adam,</HI> and therefore the earth rent not under him; the pit did not swallow him up as it did <HI>the angels that sinned,</HI> for whom there is no redemption.</P>
<P>CHRIST has been the Saviour of all <HI>those</HI> that have escaped in one destroying <HI>earthquake</HI> and another since the world began.</P>
<P>In the <HI>flood,</HI> when the <HI>foundations of the great deep</HI> were <HI>broken up,</HI> CHRIST saved <HI>Noah</HI> and his family: <HI>He</HI> gave him <HI>faith,</HI> provided him an <HI>Ark,</HI> shut him up in it, set it gently afloat, held and steer'd it in that boysterous sea (that fury of the waters) without a rudder or a sail, and softly rested it (without an an∣chor to cast out) on the mountains of <HI>Ararat.</HI> Well therefore did <HI>Noah</HI> bring his <HI>sacrifices</HI> to his Deliverer, when he came forth from the <HI>Ark,</HI> so many <HI>types</HI> of that <HI>Death</HI> from whence come all our <HI>salvations.</HI>— Who set the <HI>bow</HI> in the sky, and gave it to <HI>Noah</HI> as the token of his <HI>Covenant?</HI> but HE who afterward ap∣peared in vision to <HI>Ezekiel</HI> as a <HI>Man upon the throne, with the bow as in the day of rain.</HI></P>
<P>To go on, When <HI>Lot</HI> was saved from the fire and earthquake, it was CHRIST himself came down, and sent his <HI>angels</HI> to his house: If he had found but <HI>ten</HI> such righteous ones, he would have spared the place for their sakes.— Again, When the wall of <HI>Jerico</HI> fell, <HI>faith</HI> saved <HI>Rahab</HI> and her house. And when <HI>Babylon</HI> shall fall CHRIST will call his people out of her. Revel. 18.4.</P>
<P>The same <HI>Lord JESUS</HI> saved <HI>us</HI> and our families, our lives and our limbs, our dwellings and substance, in the day when he lately shewed us his power, his anger and our deserts. As he reach'd out his arm to
<PB N="32" REF="002853_0040_0FE6782B9F6F5530"/><HI>Peter</HI> when he sunk on the waters, and cried to him, <HI>LORD save me;</HI> so his everlasting arms were under∣neath our tottering houses, and they neither sunk nor fell. <HI>The foundations of the earth moved and were shaken,</HI> and in our <HI>distress</HI> we <HI>cried to him</HI> as our GOD; <HI>He bowed the heavens and came down, he rode upon a Cherub and did fly, yea he did fly upon the wings of the wind.</HI> Psalm 18.7, 10.</P>
<P>To conclude, The inference is strong and obvi∣ous, That if the <HI>judgments</HI> of Providence are in the hand of CHRIST, so are the <HI>mercies</HI> thereof equally from his all-governing hand; many and great and various as they are. All the <HI>preservations</HI> which are new every moment, all the <HI>deliverances</HI> which we re∣ceive in times of <HI>seen</HI> dangers and great hazards, all the <HI>supplies</HI> by which we are sustained from day to day and fed from year to year, <HI>they</HI> all come to us from the hand of our <HI>Lord JESUS,</HI> and we ought to receive them as from <HI>Him</HI> with our religious ac∣knowledgments of trust and dependance, prayer and praise.</P>
<P>We have our personal and family mercies, which are exceeding <HI>precious;</HI> and there are the common and publick mercies to the Church and people of GOD together, which are <HI>greater</HI> than those; The <HI>publick</HI> shares in the goodness of Providence to every private person, and <HI>every one</HI> shares in the general goodness of Providence to the publick; the <HI>glory</HI> of all belongs to CHRIST, and to Him we must <HI>sing</HI> both of the mercy and the judgment.</P>
<P>The same hand that fed <HI>Israel</HI> in the wilderness and punished them there, feeds and judges the <HI>Church</HI> still. Believers must know and consider that it is the death of CHRIST has purchas'd for them the com∣mon favours and bounties of Providence; in which they should taste his covenant love, <HI>taste and see that
<PB N="33" REF="002853_0041_0FE67807032A45B0"/>the LORD is gracious:</HI> And sinners must know that they are indebted to CHRIST, for all that they have of present good things, which should lead them to repentance.</P>
<P>Is <HI>Peter</HI> in prison, or <HI>Paul</HI> in the storm, it is JESUS that sends his <HI>Angel</HI> to them; or if <HI>Eneas</HI> be sick, JE∣SUS CHRIST maketh him whole.</P>
<P>And thus we have seen both the <HI>Threatning</HI> of judg∣ment, and the <HI>Salvation</HI> from it in the hand of CHRIST. What <HI>both</HI> demand from us may be con∣sidered in the next <HI>Discourse.</HI></P>

<P>WE have seen both the awful <HI>Threatning</HI> in the terrible <HI>Earthquake,</HI> and also our <HI>Preservation</HI> in it to come from CHRIST.

What saith the LORD to his people collectively, and what to me and mine inparticular?— It is a very <HI>serious,</HI> profitable and and necessary <HI>Enquiry,</HI> and to be made in a very <HI>so∣lemn</HI> manner before the LORD, And to be sure,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="34" REF="002853_0042_0FE6782BC5E48798"/>
I. The <HI>threatning</HI> in the terrible earthquake, and the <HI>preservation</HI> from a sudden destruction by it, do both of them call aloud upon us to <HI>repent and turn from all our sins, and that instantly and earnestly with fear and trembling.</HI> This is the voice of the astonishing <HI>judgment</HI> and this the voice of the wondrous <HI>mercy</HI> and deliverance.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Repentance,</HI> instant earnest and deep repentance, is the loud voice of CHRIST to us in the <HI>judgment</HI> and sudden destruction, with which we were threat∣ned. The earth <HI>trembled</HI> under our sins, and <HI>roar'd</HI> under the burden and weight of them. The <HI>shake</HI> bro't our <HI>sins</HI> quick to remembrance, and threatned us with a swift and irresistible destruction, without giving us any space for repentance, or the asking mercy. And if it was CHRIST the lover of souls who threatned us in a manner so very dreadful; then surely there are very great and dismal sins with us against our <HI>LORD REDEEMER.</HI> As <HI>Moses</HI> said in the case of the <HI>rebels in Israel,</HI> Num. 16.30. <HI>If the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD.</HI> And as the prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> teaches us, Isai. 24.5. <HI>The earth is DE∣FILED under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the law, changed the ordinances, broken the everlasting covenant; therefore hath the CURSE devoured the earth: Therefore the LORD maketh the earth empty, maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down:</HI> v. 19, 20. <HI>The earth is clean dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly; the earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and be re∣moved like a Cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall and not rise again.</HI> This <HI>conviction</HI> of sin an Earthquake brings with it, and this <HI>call</HI> to humiliation and repentance. It cries to
<PB N="35" REF="002853_0043_0FE678091B341C80"/>us, as <HI>the wall of the tower of Siloam</HI> did to the sinners of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> Luke 13.5. <HI>Except ye repent ye shall all like∣wise perish.</HI></P>
<P>When our <HI>Lord JESUS</HI> came down from heaven, it was <HI>to call sinners to repentance.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. 9.13. Mark 6.12. Luke 24.47. Acts 5.31.</NOTE> When he sent forth the <HI>twelve</HI> to preach, it was <HI>that men should repent.</HI> When he was returning to heaven, he commanded <HI>that re∣pentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations.</HI> And now he is exalted to the right hand of GOD a <HI>Prince and Saviour to give re∣pentance.</HI> What then is <HI>his voice</HI> if he come to us in fearful judgments? in a terrible <HI>Earthquake?</HI> Surely he repeats aloud the vehement <HI>warning</HI> of the holy <HI>Baptist;</HI> who came before him in the spirit of <HI>Elias,</HI> to turn the hearts of parents and children to GOD, <HI>lest he come and smite the earth with a curse:</HI> Matth 3.5—12. <HI>When he saw many of the Pharisees and Saddu∣cees come to his baptism, he said unto them, O Generation of vipers! who has warned you to flee from the wrath to come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance: And think not to say within your selves, We have Abraham to our father,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And now also the ax is laid to the root of the tree: therefore every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire.</HI>— He that hath an ear let him hear what the <HI>SPIRIT</HI> saith unto the <HI>Churches</HI> in such an awful dispensation as the <HI>Earthquake</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rev. 2.23. 3.3. 24.7.</NOTE>: He saith <HI>with a loud voice, Fear GOD and give glory to him, for the hour of his judgment is come; and worship him that made heaven and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.</HI> He saith— <HI>Repent or I will come upon thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know at what hour I will come upon thee: And I will kill thy chil∣dren within thee, except thou repent.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="36" REF="002853_0044_0FE6782D5CB3A800"/>
2. This also is the voice of the <HI>gracious preservation</HI> which we have received; the <HI>goodness</HI> and forbear∣ance of GOD herein calls upon us to <HI>repent.</HI> Rom. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 3, 4, 5. <HI>And thinkest thou O man,—that thou shalt escape the judgment of GOD? or despisest thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and longsuffering? not knowing that the goodness of GOD leadeth thee to repentance? But after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto thy self wrath against the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of GOD; who will render unto every man according to his deeds.</HI> The voice of CHRIST to us in his <HI>sparing mercy</HI> is<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. 2.21. Ezek. 18.31, 32, 33. Luke 19.42. Act. 5.19.</NOTE>, "I give thee <HI>space for re∣pentance:</HI> O that thou wouldest <HI>know that at least in this thy day the things of thy peace! Repent and be convert∣ed that your sins may be blotted out: Repent and turn your selves from all your transgressions, so iniquity shall not be your ruine: Make you a new heart and a new spirit, for why will you die? For I have no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, saith the LORD GOD; wherefore turn your selves, and live ye.</HI> This is the <HI>small and still voice</HI> of Grace, after the <HI>stormy wind</HI> and <HI>earthquake:</HI> Let us <HI>cover</HI> our faces and reverently listen to it. CHRIST says to us <HI>now</HI> as he did to the <HI>impotent</HI> man whom he had healed, John 5.14. <HI>Behold thou art made whole, sin no more lest a worse thing come upon thee.</HI> A worse thing cannot well come, save a <HI>worse earthquake;</HI> or any other judgment that may bring an equal and sud∣den destruction on thee.</P>
<P>When the <HI>jailor</HI> had felt the earthquake, and yet was not devoured by it, <HI>he sprang in trembling</HI> and ask'd, <HI>What must I do to be saved?</HI> scil. from sin and the wrath of GOD! In like fright should every <HI>spa∣red sinner</HI> make the like enquiry, and with his con∣cern and earnestness. And if we do <HI>not</HI> our crime and guilt is like <HI>theirs,</HI> Rev. 16.9. who when <HI>they
<PB N="37" REF="002853_0045_0FE67809434CBDE8"/>were scorched by the fire</HI> of divine judgments, <HI>yet repented not to give glory to GOD.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>destroying Angel</HI> has pass'd thro' every <HI>Town,</HI> and thro' every <HI>street,</HI> and cried at every <HI>door; RE∣PENT, REPENT!</HI> every <HI>person,</HI> every <HI>family,</HI> every <HI>age order</HI> and <HI>degree</HI> of men! <HI>Sanctify</HI> your selves and your housholds to the LORD, lest he <HI>break</HI> forth up∣on you! <HI>Sanctify</HI> your selves every one <HI>upon his own sins,</HI> his most beloved sin! smite upon <HI>thy own</HI> breast, feeling the <HI>plague</HI> of thy heart, and say <HI>What have I done!</HI> and <HI>sigh</HI> and cry for the sins of <HI>others,</HI> that the <HI>mark</HI> of GOD may be set upon thee, before the <HI>coals of fire</HI> be scattered down.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>threatning</HI> in the terrible earthquake and the <HI>preservation</HI> from it, call us to <HI>repentance.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. They do more particularly mean to convict men of and deter them from <HI>those flagrant crimes and heights of impiety</HI> which GOD has sometimes punish∣ed or threatned to punish with desolating earth∣quakes. Such are the sin and wickedness of the <HI>Old World,</HI> of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> the holy City, and of <HI>Babylon</HI> which now is.</P>
<P N="1">1. An earthquake warns men of the sin and gene∣ral corruption of the <HI>Old World;</HI> when mankind by a universal contempt of religion, fearlessness of GOD, and dissolution of manners, bro't the <HI>flood of water</HI> upon the earth. A deluge of iniquity and impiety first covered the face of it, and then came the flood of Divine wrath which tore it to pieces. Gen. 6.5, 11, 12. <HI>GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the tho't of his heart was only evil continually: And it repented the LORD that he had made man upon the earth, and it griev∣ed him at his heart: And he said I will destroy Man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth: — The
<PB N="38" REF="002853_0046_0FE6782D843DC508"/>earth was corrupt before GOD, and was filled with vi∣olence; for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.</HI> All manner and degrees of impiety toward GOD, and unrighteousness toward one another, is the charge here exhibited against every order, rank and age of mankind: A universal degeneracy into the very dregs of all ungodliness, profaness and licentiousness. Nor was it <HI>this</HI> place, or that, which was so vile and a∣bandon'd, but every place and people. <HI>Noah</HI> alone was found righteous before GOD, and he only was faved with his house. <Q>When wickedness is become general and <HI>universal,</HI> ruine is not far off: While there is a remnant of praying people in a nation or countrey to empty the measure as it fills, judg∣ments may be kept off a great while; But when all hands are at work to pull down the fences of sin, and none stand in the gap to make up the breach, What can be expected but an <HI>Inundation</HI> of wrath?</Q> So Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></P>
<P>We may observe that in the day of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and of the <HI>Cananites,</HI> and of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and so of <HI>Babylon,</HI> a <HI>general corruption</HI> brings on the desolation. <HI>This</HI> GOD warns against by every <HI>earthquake.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The sins of <HI>Sodom</HI> come first in order of time and degree of impiety in the <HI>new</HI> world. The <HI>cry</HI> of their <HI>grievous</HI> sin was <HI>great</HI> before CHRIST, and an <HI>earthquake</HI> devoured them. The fire of <HI>lust</HI> burnt among them in a rage and flame that reach'd up to heaven, and bro't down fire and brimstone on them; made them a <HI>hell</HI> above ground, and then the <HI>pit</HI> swallow'd them up. Intemperance and luxury was their sin, pride and idleness, and <HI>lewdness</HI> in such a kind and excess as has left the name and brand of <HI>Sodomy</HI> on the unnatural lust forever. GOD gave them up to <HI>uncleaness</HI> and then to the flames and the <HI>earthquake.</HI> Read their sin, Romans, 1.26, 27, 28.
<PB N="39" REF="002853_0047_0FE6780D9F8415B0"/>and Eph. 4.19. <HI>Who being past seeking, have given themselves over to work all uncleaness with greediness.</HI> When they saw but a beauteous <HI>Angel</HI> in the form of a man they were for <HI>knowing</HI> him; to satisfy their worse than <HI>brutish</HI> lust upon him. And so <HI>furious</HI> was their lust, and so <HI>general</HI> the contagion, that before bed-time <HI>they compassed the house round, both old and young, all the people, from every quarter,</HI> threatning <HI>Lot</HI> if he did not render up his lovely guests to them. No like example of <HI>impurity</HI> has been known on the earth, and therefore these <HI>are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire.</HI> Jude. v. 7. When the like promiscuous and incestuous mixtures were found in <HI>Israel,</HI> there came an earthquake in the days of <HI>Amos:</HI> Amos. 1.1. and 2.7. An <HI>Earthquake</HI> therefore comes to convince of and warn against the sins of <HI>Sodom,</HI> and every tendency thereunto.</P>
<P N="3">3. The sins of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> also, the <HI>holy city</HI> by pro∣fession and covenant obligations, are bro't to mind when GOD visits his professing people with an <HI>earth∣quake.</HI></P>
<P>The Prophet <HI>Zechariah</HI> remembers the remnant of <HI>Israel,</HI> how their <HI>Fathers fled before the Earthquake in the days of King Uzziah.</HI> Zech. 14.5. <Q>The <HI>Jews</HI> have a tradition, that it hapned just at the time when <HI>Uzziah</HI> presumptuously invaded the priest's office, and went in to burn incense.</Q> 2 Chron. 26.16. If it were so it would lead us also to think of the re∣bellion of <HI>Corah</HI> and the presumption of his <HI>associates;</HI> Num. 16. The fire of GOD consumed the <HI>first,</HI> and the earth swallowed up the <HI>latter.</HI> Such are named after the sinners of <HI>Sodom, Iude</HI> v. 8. <HI>Filthy dreamers, that defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities.</HI></P>
<P>But to come to <HI>Jerusalem</HI>'s sin in the days of <HI>Uz∣ziah</HI> when the <HI>earthquake</HI> visited them, and that a
<PB N="40" REF="002853_0048_0FE67831D9F2BEF8"/><HI>horrible</HI> one which put them into a very great terror. <HI>Isaiah</HI> and <HI>Amos</HI> were the LORD's prothets in those days. <HI>Amos</HI> dates his Prophecy <HI>two years before the Earthquake.</HI> He warn'd them of it before it came. The sins of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah</HI> at that time provoked the LORD to send the earthquake. And what <HI>their sins</HI> were may be gathered from <HI>these prophecies;</HI> from the whole of <HI>Amos,</HI> and from the <HI>five</HI> first Chapters of <HI>Isaiah.</HI></P>
<P>The sins of <HI>Sodom</HI> were among them: Amos. 2.7. <HI>A man and his father will go in to the same maid, to pro∣fane my holy name.</HI> Vile and filthy <HI>incest,</HI> equal to al∣most any of the Abominations of the heathen. There∣fore <HI>Isaiah</HI> began his prophecy with that severe re∣buke and reproach, <HI>Hear the word of the LORD, ye ru∣lers of Sodom; give ear to the law of our GOD ye people of Gomorrah.</HI> Such was the <HI>vine</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> become, and such their <HI>grapes</HI> and <HI>clusters;</HI> and <HI>except the LORD of Hosts had left a very small remnant, they would have been as Sodom and Gomorrah</HI> in their punishment; over∣thrown like them.</P>
<P>Their sins were numerous, multiplied, repeated and persisted in; there were <HI>three transgressions and four</HI> among them before the judgments came: Amos. 1.4. They were <HI>laden with iniquity.</HI> Isai. 1.4. They sin∣ned against great <HI>light</HI> and many <HI>means</HI> of grace, which inhaunc'd their guilt and hasten'd on the judg∣ment: Amos. 3.2. <HI>You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.</HI> They <HI>corrupted</HI> religion which they had received pure and undefiled in the word of GOD; they confounded <HI>moral</HI> good and evil, Isai. 5.20. and mixt the worship of GOD and the <HI>calves</HI> together. Amos. 4.4. They were <HI>worldly, panting after the dust of the earth,</HI> Amos. 2.7. weary of their <HI>Sabbaths and new moons,</HI> and wishing them <HI>over,</HI> that they might set forth their <HI>wheat</HI> and sell corn: Amos. 8.5. They
<PB N="41" REF="002853_0049_0FE6780DC671CF90"/>were for <HI>joyning house to house, and laying field to field, that they might be plac'd alone in the earth.</HI> Isai. 5.8. They were <HI>unjust,</HI> unrighteous and oppressive, both in their <HI>private</HI> dealings and in their <HI>Courts</HI> of justice<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Amos 2.6. 3.10. 5▪2. 6.12.</NOTE> <HI>They sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of shoes: they turned aside the way of the meek: They shored up violence and robbery in their palaces, and know not to do right: They afflicted the just, they took a bribe, and turned aside the poor in the Gate: These were their manifold transgressions and mighty sins: They turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into hemlock! They swallowed up the needy and made the poor of the land to fail: They made the Ephah small, and falsified</HI> the weights and <HI>ballances:</HI> For these things <HI>the Land was made to tremble, and the earth was darkned in the clear day, and their houses were smitten, the winter house and the summer house together.</HI> Amos. 3.15. <HI>Isaiah</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. 1.21,—27. 3.14, 15. 5.23.</NOTE> brings the same charges against them, and mentions it as a <HI>scarlet and crimson sin</HI> that they did not <HI>seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless and plead for the widow;</HI> but <HI>every one loved gifts, and followed after rewards; Therefore the Mighty One of Israel said, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries and avenge me of my enemies.</HI></P>
<P>All this was done under a <HI>form</HI> of Godliness, a profession and <HI>shew</HI> of religion, and this render'd it much the more ungodly and vile. Under a high pre∣tence of devotion and obedience they were thus un∣righteous, prsane and impious. <HI>Isaiah</HI> therefore asks them <HI>to what purpose the multitude of their sacrisices</HI> were? and bids them <HI>bring no more vain oblations:</HI> for their <HI>incense was an abomination,</HI> and their very <HI>Sabbaths</HI> an <HI>iniquity.</HI> And <HI>Amos</HI> tells them the same, Amos 5.21. <HI>I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in your solemn assemblies,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>take away from me the noise of your
<PB N="42" REF="002853_0050_0FE6783200E1FB90"/>songs,— but let judgment run down as water, and righ∣teousness as a mighty stream.</HI></P>
<P>This corruption was <HI>general,</HI> Isai. 1.4, 6. <HI>The nati∣on was sinful,</HI> they were <HI>a seed of evil deers, children that were corrupters; from the sole of the foot even to the head there was no soundness, but wounds and bruises and putrifying sores.</HI> They were bold and impudent in sin, <HI>declaring it as Sodom:</HI> Isai. 3.9. They were proud and haughty in their attire, <HI>the dau'ters of Sion walked with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes, mincing and tinkling with their feet:</HI> but they were told that the <HI>LORD would take away the bravery of their tinkling ornaments, and their round tires like the moon:</HI> Isai. 3.18.</P>
<P>They were <HI>fearless</HI> of judgments, and would not <HI>ob∣serve</HI> them when they came; they derided GOD's <HI>threatnings,</HI> and sinned on after all his warnings: <HI>GOD overthrew some of them</HI> as he had <HI>Sodom and Gomorrab, and they were as a brand plucked out of the burning; yet would they not return</HI> unto him. Amos 4.11. They <HI>rose up early in the morning to follow strong drink, and continued</HI> at it in the evening <HI>till wine inflamed them; The harp and viol, the tabret and the pipe were in their feasts; but they regarded not the work of the LORD, nei∣ther considered the operation of his hand:</HI> Isai. 5.11, 12. <HI>They drew iniquity with cords of vanity and sinn'd as it were with a cart-rope; They said, Let him make speed, and hasten his work that we may see it;</HI> believing and fearing nothing of it; <HI>They cast away the law of the LORD of Hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</HI> v. 18, 19, 24. <HI>They put far away the evil day, and caused the seat of violence to come near.</HI> Amos. 6.3.</P>
<P>This was the state and these the sins of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Israel</HI> when they were visited of the <HI>LORD of Hosts</HI> with the earthquake in the days of <HI>Uzziah.</HI> And the <HI>Earthquake</HI> that has lately visited <HI>us</HI> warns us from GOD of any <HI>tendencies</HI> among us to the same
<PB N="43" REF="002853_0051_0FE678604724B470"/>iniquities. And in whatsoever degrees they are <HI>found</HI> among us, it calls aloud upon us to <HI>repent</HI> and turn from them with fear and trembling. For <HI>shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD.</HI> As the sinners in <HI>Israel</HI> fled at the cry of their sinking brethren, say∣ing, <HI>lest the earth swallow us up also!</HI> so ought we at the <HI>roar</HI> of an earthquake to fear and fly from those sins for which GOD hath sometimes visited his peo∣ple. —It remains that I just mention,</P>
<P N="4">4. And lastly, The sins of <HI>Babylon</HI> which now is, the <HI>Romish Babylon.</HI> She is spiritually called <HI>Sodom,</HI> and is like to perish by earthquake and fire. <HI>Idolatry</HI> and <HI>Blood</HI> are eminently her sins; but lust and sodomy, pride and idleness, every abomination and filthiness, corporal and spiritual, are found with that <HI>mother of harlots.</HI> The <HI>blood of the saints</HI> is found in her; and great will be her <HI>fall:</HI> Even as if we saw <HI>a mighty Angel take up a great milstone, and cast it into the sea. Thus with violence shall that great City Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all. Her sins reach to heaven, and strong is the LORD GOD that judgeth her.</HI> Revel. 18. init.</P>
<P>By every <HI>shake</HI> of the earth GOD says to his <HI>Pro∣testant</HI> people, <HI>Partake not of her sins that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI> So he said of <HI>old Babylon,</HI> Jerem. 51.6. <HI>Flee out of the midst of her, and deliver every man his soul: Be not cut off in her iniquity; for this is the time of the LORD's vengeance.</HI> So the <HI>Angels</HI> said to <HI>Lot</HI> in the last night of <HI>Sodom,</HI> Gen. 19.12. <HI>Hast thou here any besides? son or daughter? bring them out of this place; for the LORD hath sent us to destroy it.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have briefly pointed out <HI>those sins and sinners</HI> which GOD has sometimes punished, or threatned to punish with <HI>earthquakes.</HI> Let us be afraid of such kind and degrees of sin. Let our <HI>flesh tremble for fear of
<PB N="44" REF="002853_0052_0FE67834D00A00B8"/>GOD and let us be afraid of his judgments.</HI> Let us <HI>depart from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest</HI> we <HI>be consumed in all their sins.</HI> Should we <HI>join in affinity with the people of these abominations, would not GOD be angry with us, and consume us</HI> with them? — Yet how many of <HI>their</HI> sins are there with <HI>us</HI> be∣fore the LORD? for which the righteous GOD has been awfully <HI>threatning us.</HI> We remain <HI>escaped</HI> this day, and the <HI>Lord our GOD is righteous!</HI> it becomes us to humble our selves and say with <HI>Ezra; Behold we are before thee in our trespasses, and we cannot stand before thee because of this</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here this <HI>Sermon</HI> may be <HI>divided.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Earthquake</HI> that visited us, and wherein we have been mercifully <HI>preserved</HI> by CHRIST not only meant to awaken <HI>greater Sinners</HI> to repentance, but <HI>all</HI> and every one, even the <HI>least</HI> of sinners. The shake was <HI>common</HI> to all; the greater and the less, elder and younger, godly and ungodly; and <HI>awful</HI> to all, awakning to all. It bro't every ones <HI>sin</HI> to re∣membrance, and set every one a <HI>trembling.</HI> Every ones <HI>Conscience</HI> answer'd to the terrible Voice of GOD at that instant, as speaking to him. The <HI>child</HI>'s heart smote him as well as the <HI>Parents,</HI> and his <HI>that feared GOD</HI> as well as his <HI>who feared</HI> him not.</P>
<P>He that is without <HI>sin</HI> let him be without <HI>fear,</HI> and stand excepted from the call to <HI>repent.</HI> It came not to call the <HI>righteous</HI> but <HI>sinners</HI> to repentance; even as CHRIST himself came. Who can say, <HI>I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my sin?</HI> And if not, Who then can say, The warning was not to <HI>me?</HI> Every <HI>sin</HI> (and much more every <HI>sinner,</HI> the <HI>least</HI> of whom is guilty of <HI>many</HI> sins) "deserves the wrath and curse of GOD both in this life and that which is to come.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>greatest</HI> sinners are in the greatest <HI>dan∣ger,</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="002853_0053_0FE67861C5307208"/>and should be in the greatest <HI>fear:</HI> But it is not always so. Very often the <HI>least sinners</HI> fear <HI>most</HI> under the judgments of GOD, and always the <HI>most Godly</HI> fear <HI>best,</HI> if not most, under his awful threatnings; while <HI>greater</HI> sinners are too often fearless and hard∣ned. So <HI>Moses</HI> was afraid of the fierce anger of the LORD, lest it should break forth upon the fearless sinners; and <HI>Josiah</HI>'s heart was <HI>tender</HI> and he <HI>rent</HI> his robes, when it may be his <HI>Courtiers</HI> were not a whit moved.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then let me say, The <HI>Earthquake</HI> came to awa∣ken <HI>greater sinners</HI> to a <HI>great</HI> repentance for their <HI>many</HI> and <HI>mighty</HI> sins. It came to set <HI>these</HI> in order before them, and it call'd upon <HI>them</HI> to <HI>rend their hearts.</HI> Did not <HI>their</HI> hearts smite them? was not their <HI>Countenance changed,</HI> and how did their <HI>tho'ts trouble</HI> them? Well might their <HI>joynts be loosed,</HI> and their <HI>knees smite one a∣gainst another? Fearfulness and trembling came upon</HI> them, and <HI>horror overwhelmed</HI> them. A <HI>vision pass'd before</HI> them <HI>which made all</HI> their <HI>bones to shake, and the hair of</HI> their <HI>head stood up.</HI> Every hardy sinner <HI>sprang up trem∣bling;</HI> the <HI>atheist</HI> believ'd and trembled, the <HI>prayerless</HI> called upon GOD, the <HI>profane</HI> tongue faulter'd, and the lips of the <HI>blasphemer</HI> quiver'd: The <HI>worldling</HI> felt his earth sinking, the <HI>drunkard</HI> saw it reeling like himself, and rottenness enter'd into the <HI>lewd</HI> man's bones: the <HI>liar,</HI> the <HI>thief</HI> and the <HI>false swearer</HI> saw the <HI>flying-roll</HI> enter'd into their <HI>house, to consume it with the timber and stones thereof:</HI> The <HI>Sabbath-breaker</HI> tho't his soul <HI>that night required</HI> for the profanation of the <HI>Day</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Earthquake</HI> was in the night after the <HI>Lord's day.</HI></NOTE> past; and every <HI>formal,</HI> careless, irreverent and hy∣pocritical worshipper had that peal of <HI>woes</HI> rung in his cars, Matth. 23.</P>
<P>Thus CHRIST came in the <HI>earthquake,</HI> as he will hereafter in the <HI>judgment day,</HI> to <HI>convince all that are
<PB N="46" REF="002853_0054_0FE67834F20A68D8"/>ungodly of their ungodly deeds and hard speeches;</HI> yet to soften and take away the <HI>heart of stone,</HI> and to break the <HI>rock</HI> in pieces. The wicked are harder than the earth and stones if they are not moved and shaken and broken under such a providence; harder than the cruel hearts of the inraged mob and magistrates at <HI>Phi∣lippi,</HI> who when they had sorely beaten <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Si∣las,</HI> and thrust them into the dungeon, yet when the <HI>earthquake</HI> came at night they were so terrified and convinced of their unrighteous act, that as soon as it was day they sent and released them; yea came themselves and beso't them and brought them out of prison. And well might "<HI>their Consciences make furi∣ous reflections</HI> on them for what they had done, when they came to consider that they had used the <HI>Men of GOD</HI> so barbarously only for casting the <HI>devil</HI> out of a possessed <HI>damsel;</HI> and when GOD had <HI>shook</HI> the City, made the ground to tremble, at their horrid deed.</P>
<P>But <HI>secondly, Lesser</HI> sinners should be awakned and much affected at a terrifying <HI>earthquake,</HI> as well as greater sinners. And indeed <HI>these</HI> are more likely to hear and fear, and receive instruction. The impre∣ssion enters the easier and deeper on a <HI>tender</HI> heart. In what a fright were our <HI>Children</HI> and young people, many of them, when they heard and felt the <HI>Earth∣quake?</HI> how did they <HI>run</HI> to the presence and arms of their helpless <HI>Parents,</HI> and attend to their <HI>prayers</HI> in that hour of consternation? what <HI>gracious words</HI> did many of them speak to their pious Parents at that time? And how were <HI>all that fear GOD</HI> affected with his hand, humbled under it and the more penitent before him? The <HI>men of GOD</HI> did, like <HI>Moses,</HI> fear <HI>exceedingly;</HI> were afraid of his <HI>fierce</HI> anger. Like <HI>Abra∣ham</HI> they were moved for the souls and bodies of o∣thers, for the godly and for the wicked, for <HI>Lots house</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="002853_0055_0FE67861E7B000F0"/>and for every <HI>sodomite.</HI> Like <HI>Ezra</HI> they rent their hearts for their own and their people's sins. Like <HI>Josiah</HI> their heart was tender, and they cried out— <HI>Great is the wrath of the LORD against us.</HI> Like <HI>Moses</HI> they ran into the <HI>gap,</HI> and stood in the <HI>breach,</HI> to turn away GOD's anger. And like <HI>David</HI> some might <HI>open</HI> their own conscious hearts to the sword of justice, and say, <HI>Upon me LORD let thy hand be,</HI> but spare the sheep of thy pasture.</P>
<P>Every gracious heart is tender and <HI>contrite</HI> before GOD, and <HI>trembles</HI> at his voice, whether in his writ∣ten Word or speaking Providence: And to every such person the <HI>high and lofty One</HI> will look. Isai. 66.2. Gracious <HI>Elihu</HI> could not see the <HI>lightning</HI> of GOD nor hear his <HI>thunder</HI> (things much more common than an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> yet awful like it) but <HI>his heart trembled and was moved out of its place:</HI> Job 37.1. <HI>Hear atten∣tively</HI> (says he) <HI>the noise of his voice, and the sound that goeth out of his mouth! He directeth it under the whole heaven,— after it a voice roareth:— Hearken to it, O. Iob: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of GOD.</HI> The best of men need to be awakned, and to awake themselves to a very humble diligent attenti∣on to the mind of GOD in his wondrous works. And none will hearken to him with like reverence and godly fear as the most godly. Like the Prophet <HI>Hab∣bakkuk</HI> who <HI>heard GOD's speech and was afraid,</HI> and pray'd, <HI>O LORD in wrath remember mercy.</HI> Hab. 3.16. <HI>When I heard my belly trembled, my lips quivered, rottenness enter'd into my bones.</HI> Well might this be, had the <HI>Prophet</HI> been holier than he was; for he saw <HI>the ever∣lasting mountains scattered and the perpetual hills bowing</HI> before the Majesty of GOD.</P>
<P>So then under such a dispensation as this, of a dreadful <HI>Earthquake,</HI> every sinner, the <HI>greater</HI> and the <HI>less</HI> are loudly called to humiliation and repentance. Surely the <HI>greater</HI> will think the shake sent to <HI>them,</HI>
<PB N="48" REF="002853_0056_0FE6783C133D52D0"/>and surely not to them only, but to <HI>me</HI> also, will the <HI>least</HI> of sinners be ready to say; Yea <HI>to me the chief of sinners</HI> will he say that is most <HI>eminent in grace</HI> and in repentance. — But to go on,</P>
<P N="4">IV. The <HI>earthquake</HI> came and CHRIST <HI>preserv'd us in it</HI> to awaken us to an instant flight to <HI>Him</HI> as the <HI>Refuge</HI> of our souls, the rock and <HI>tower of salvation</HI> to us. <HI>The name of the LORD is a strong tower, the righte∣ous runneth into it and is safe.</HI> Prov. 18.10. Such is CHRIST, his righteousness and the promises in him. The name of GOD is in him, and we must flee to him for safety from the deserved judgments of GOD. We must put our selves by faith into those <HI>saving hands</HI> which are filled with the <HI>burning coals.</HI> No other hand can save us. The <HI>Man clothed with linnen</HI> says to us, <HI>Look unto me and be ye saved all ye ends of the earth.</HI> The <HI>coals</HI> in his hands must <HI>hasten</HI> our flight to him. We must flee unto him to <HI>hide</HI> us. He will <HI>cover</HI> us with his spotless robe, and not a <HI>spark</HI> from the coals shall fall on us. How would he gather us, <HI>as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings</HI> in a time of dan∣ger! How gladly then should we <HI>gather</HI> to him, to the <HI>covert</HI> of his wings. Psal. 57.1. <HI>Be merciful unto me O GOD, be merciful unto me, for my soul trusteth in thee; Yea in the shadow of thy wings will I make my re∣fuge until these calamities be overpast.</HI> There is no safe∣ty for us <HI>now,</HI> at <HI>death,</HI> nor in the day of <HI>judgment,</HI> without an interest in CHRIST by faith. We must <HI>count all things loss</HI> that we may <HI>be found in him.</HI> He is our <HI>Ark</HI> when the flood comes, He our <HI>Zoar</HI> when the fire and brimstone falls, He the <HI>rock</HI> to build on that our house may stand when the wind and rains beat. The design of the preached Gospel, and the end of mercies and of judgments, is to lead sinners to him. The <HI>cities of refuge</HI> of old were figures and <HI>types</HI> of CHRIST the refuge of guilty and repenting
<PB N="49" REF="002853_0057_0FE67866AED09E80"/>sinners; <HI>they have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before them.</HI> Hebrews. 6.18. They need not <HI>fear, tho' the earth be removed, and tho' the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea.</HI></P>
<P>An Earthquake should <HI>shake</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Eph. 5.14. Gen. 19.17. Zech. 9.11, 12. Job. 22.21. Isai. 27.4.</NOTE> <HI>sinners</HI> under the Gos∣pel out of their <HI>Security.</HI> It cried in their ears at <HI>midnight, Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and CHRIST shall give thee life.</HI> It bid them <HI>escape for their life to the mountain,</HI> without <HI>looking be∣hind them.</HI> It cried to them, <HI>Turn to the strong hold ye prisoners of hope!</HI> Come forth from <HI>the pit wherein is no water! by the blood of thy covenant</HI> thou art redeemed from it. <HI>Acquaint now thy self with CHRIST and be at peace: take hold of</HI> his <HI>strength</HI> and get into a state of <HI>reconciliation</HI> and peace with GOD. How shall <HI>briars and thorns</HI> stand <HI>before devouring fire?</HI></P>
<P>It would also awake <HI>drowsie Saints</HI> out of their slumbers, being as the <HI>midnight cry</HI> too in the ears of the <HI>wise</HI> to arise and <HI>trim their lamps, because the Bride∣groom cometh.</HI> Their <HI>faith</HI> should be invigorated by such a Providence; their <HI>hope</HI> and <HI>trust</HI> actuated; <HI>My GOD, my strength, the horn of my salvation, and my high tower.</HI> Their godly <HI>fear</HI> and reverence should be ex∣cited and increased; as when he rais'd and laid the terrible <HI>tempest,</HI> they <HI>feared exceedingly, and said one to another, What manner of man is this?</HI> It becomes us <HI>so</HI> to fear the LORD and his greatness; the LORD and <HI>his goodness.</HI> Hosea. 3.5. Moved with <HI>fear,</HI> like <HI>Noah,</HI> let us get into our <HI>ark.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Jonah</HI> was in the tempest, ready to founder, he said, <HI>I fear the GOD of Heaven, that hath made the Sea and the dry land.</HI> And when <HI>Darius</HI> saw <HI>Daniel</HI> preserved in the den of <HI>lions</HI> and taken out alive, he made a very pious <HI>Decree;</HI> to which we and ours
<PB N="50" REF="002853_0058_0FE6783C33FFFB30"/>should be obedient with the utmost reverence and gra∣titude; <HI>Dan.</HI> 6.26. <HI>I make a decree, that in every domi∣nion of my kingdom men tremble and fear before the GOD of Daniel;</HI> — who <HI>delivereth and rescueth, and work∣eth signs and wonders in heaven and in earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Love</HI> is the next duty, and our <HI>first,</HI> to CHRIST our merciful Preserver. <HI>In love to our souls</HI> he has <HI>delivered us</HI> and ours <HI>from going down into the pit;</HI> and what less can we render to him than our best and highest love? To love him <HI>with all the understanding and all the heart</HI> is more than all whole burnt offering and sacrifice. Psalm. 18.1, 2. <HI>I will love thee, O LORD my strength, my rock, my fortress and my deliverer.</HI> Psalm. 116.1. <HI>I love the LORD because he hath heard my voice and my supplication.</HI></P>
<P>Faith fear and love will produce <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>praises</HI> to our King, our <HI>Judge</HI> and our <HI>Saviour. Prayer</HI> is a grand part of our homage. Psalm. 18.3. <HI>I will call upon the LORD who is worthy to be praised, so shall I be saved.</HI> Psalm. 116.4. <HI>Then called I upon the name of the LORD, O LORD I beseech thee deliver my soul.</HI> When CHRIST comes forth as a <HI>Judge</HI> we should meet him with <HI>Abraham</HI>'s most reverend <HI>Supplications:</HI> And when we look to him as a <HI>Saviour</HI> it must be with <HI>David</HI>'s prayer; <HI>Unto thee will I pray, my King and my GOD.</HI></P>
<P>To be sure <HI>Praise</HI> waiteth for Him in <HI>Zion</HI> who is the <HI>Saviour.</HI> His name and benefits can't be tho't of, and much less duely mention'd without <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> and praises. <HI>Bless the LORD O my soul, and all that is within me bless his holy Name! O bless our GOD ye people, and cause the voice of his praise to be heard; who holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved. I will extol thee my GOD, O King, and I will praise thy name for ever and ever; Every day will I bless thee and I will praise</HI> &amp;c. <HI>One generation shall praise thy works to a∣nother, and shall declare thy mighty acts. I will mention
<PB N="51" REF="002853_0059_0FE67866D4CB0750"/>the loving-kindnesses of the LORD, and the praises of the LORD, according to all his great goodness, and the multi∣tude of his loving kindnesses</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm 103.66.145. Isai. 63.7.</NOTE>. When CHRIST had shewn great <HI>mercy</HI> to one, and had wro't a great <HI>de∣liverance</HI> for him, he bid him <HI>neturn to his house and declare what great things the LORD had done for him: And he forth and published every where what JESUS had done for him.</HI> Luke 11.24. Let us go and do like∣wise, and sing to CHRIST the 118. Psalm, 17,—24.</P>
<P>To conclude this head, <HI>Self-dedication</HI> and the re∣newed solemn acts of it, is the Offering due from us to CHRIST as our Judge and our <HI>Deliverer.</HI> As the <HI>Egyptians</HI> said to <HI>Joseph, Thou hast saved our lives, we will be Pharaoh's servants.</HI> It is <HI>our selves,</HI> body and soul with all their powers, the devotion of our hearts and the obedience of our lives, that we must render to our <HI>Saviour.</HI> So we are taught, Rom. 6.13. <HI>Yield your selves unto GOD.</HI> So we are besought, Rom. 12.1. <HI>I beseech you, brethren, by the mercies of GOD, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to GOD.</HI> The grand reason for this du∣ty is given us, 1 Cor. 6. ult. <HI>Ye are not your own, but are bought with a price; therefore glorify GOD in your bo∣dy and in your spirits, which are GOD's.</HI> When the <HI>Plalmist</HI> made a record of a singular salvation which GOD had granted him, thus he made his grateful return to his GOD and Saviour; Psalm 116. <HI>O LORD; truly I am thy servant, I am thy servant! I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Earthquake,</HI> and our preservation in it by the hand of CHRIST, should hasten our <HI>flight</HI> to <HI>Him</HI> as the <HI>refuge</HI> of our souls; with faith, fear, love, prayer, praise, and self consecration. We should
<PB N="52" REF="002853_0060_0FE6783D9B741F38"/>be very solemn, fervent, deliberate and yet speedy in this personal transaction with the great GOD.</P>
<P N="5">V. FAMILY-RELIGION is a very special duty which the earthquake and our preservation in it ad∣monishes us of and calls us to. The threatning was to <HI>families</HI> and the preservation was of them. Our <HI>houses</HI> were shaken, and yet spared. They might have crush'd and buried us. CHRIST's voice to us is serve me in your houses; and our answer should be that, Josh. 24.15. <HI>As for me and my house we will serve the LORD.</HI> Our housholds and our substance should be bro't under a renewed consecration to CHRIST, and have HOLINESS TO THE LORD written on them. The walls and <HI>stones</HI> of our houses in a manner <HI>cried</HI> to us as they seem'd falling, and they may <HI>cry out</HI> against us if the fear and worship of GOD be not always in them for time to come.</P>
<P>CHRIST calls us to repent of and reform our <HI>family sins,</HI> and that <HI>we put iniquity far from our taberna∣cles.</HI> Job. 22.23. And he warns us to make more conscience of family and <HI>relative duties.</HI> For instance, FAMILY INSTRUCTION; according to the command of GOD Deut. 6.6, 7, 8. <HI>And these words which I command thee this day shall be in thy heart, and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children; and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou liest down and when thou risest up.</HI> FAMILY-WOR∣SHIP is another duty which the preservation of our dwellings and housholds demands of us: family <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>praise</HI> morning and evening, together with the reading GOD's word. Shall there be any <HI>prayerless families</HI> among us, or prayerless <HI>persons</HI> and <HI>closets</HI> in any family, after such a shake of our houses? GOD forbid. Read the righteous and terrible Imprecation or curse that hangs over such irreligious houses, Jer. 10.25. <HI>Pour out thy fury upon the heathen, and upon
<PB N="53" REF="002853_0061_0FE6786A009F12A8"/>the families that call not upon thy name.</HI> Say not it means the families of false worship and <HI>Idolatry</HI> in the heathen nations; for grant it — yet thy house <HI>(O Christian)</HI> is worse in GOD's sight than any <HI>hea∣thens</HI> if CHRIST be not daily worshipt in it. Carry thy house daily to <HI>him</HI> to be <HI>sprinkled</HI> with his blood, <HI>the blood of the passover,</HI> that the <HI>Angel of death</HI> may not smite it. Let our spared dwellings be <HI>Bethels,</HI> for GOD to be <HI>worshipt</HI> in, for him to <HI>dwell</HI> in. And let the presence of CHRIST in them, with the judg∣ments and salvations of Providence in his hand, be awfully apprehended by us in daily family worship. As <HI>Jacob</HI> wak'd in the morning and said, <HI>How dread∣ful is the place! it is the house of GOD and gate of heaven.</HI> And that CHRIST may come under our <HI>roof,</HI> and bring <HI>salvation</HI> with him as he did to the house of <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> let FAMILY-GOVERNMENT be pre∣served and maintained among us. When GOD threatned our houses lately, did he not in effect send us the message which he did once to <HI>Eli, Tell him that I will judge his house, for that when his sons made themselves vile he restrained them not.</HI> And now that GOD has preserv'd our houses and housholds, should we not resolve and pray and sing with <HI>David,</HI> Psalm. 101. <HI>I will sing of mercy and of judgment, unto thee O LORD will I sing: I will behave my self wisely in a perfect way; O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart; I will set no wicked thing before my eyes; I hate the work of them that turn aside, it shall not cleave to me:— He that walk∣eth in a perfect way he shall serve me; he that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house; he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover,</P>
<P>Not only should Heads of families, but <HI>children</HI> and <HI>servants</HI> also, be greatly aw'd and affected with the threatning and salvation of GOD's providence. Be
<PB N="54" REF="002853_0062_0FE6783DC430F3C8"/><HI>subject</HI> to your parents, to your masters and mistres∣ses, as unto CHRIST. Eph. 6.6. Attend the <HI>worship</HI> of the family with great seriousness and reverence, and submit to the <HI>good order</HI> and rule of the House, for it is the Government of CHRIST. There is a parental as well as a pastoral <HI>watch,</HI> and it is for your <HI>souls, as those that must give an account, that they may do it with joy and not with grief.</HI>— In a word, We read of <HI>the voice of salvation and rejoicing in the taber∣nacles of the righteous:</HI> So let it be with <HI>us;</HI> The voice of <HI>salvation</HI> and rejoicing is in our dwellings, let them be the tabernacles of the <HI>righteous.</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. From <HI>our own</HI> houses let us pass to the <HI>House of GOD:</HI> The threatning <HI>Earthquake</HI> and our pre∣servation in it loudly calls us to a more reverend re∣gard to his <HI>holy Sabbath</HI> and the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of his Worship. The <HI>Lord's-day,</HI> is the religious sanctifica∣tion of it, is the special season and means of <HI>holiness</HI> among men, and of <HI>glory</HI> to CHRIST. Therefore is the observation of it so strictly commanded, and the profanation so severely threatned and revenged<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Levit. 19.30. Exod. 31.13 Jorem. 17.27. Levit. 26.31, 34. 2 Chron. 36.20, 21.</NOTE>. <HI>ye shall keep my Sabbaths, I am the LORD: Verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep, for it is a sign between me and you thro' out your generations, that I am the LORD that doth sanctify you. But if ye will not hearken to me to hallow the Sabbath day, then I will kindle a fire in the gates of Jerusalem, which shall devour its palaces.</HI> And accor∣dingly the <HI>coals</HI> in my text were scattered on <HI>Jerusalem</HI> for polluting GOD's sabbaths: <HI>They burnt the house of GOD and brake down the wall of Jerusalem, and carried the remnant to Babylon, to fulfil the word of the LORD, until the land enjoy'd her Sabbaths.</HI> As therefore it was in the night after the <HI>Lord's-day</HI> that the terrible
<PB N="55" REF="002853_0063_0FE6786A241EB828"/>Earthquake visited us, so it calls us to judge our selves for the many <HI>Sabbaths</HI> which we may have trifled away and lost, profaned and polluted. Take it as a loud warning against the <HI>looseness</HI> of multitudes on the <HI>Evenings</HI> of the <HI>Lord's-day;</HI> as well as for the <HI>neglect</HI> of GOD's public Worship by multitudes among us. And let persons and families judge themselves for their secret and family omissions and disorders. Do they not <HI>bring wrath</HI> upon the land <HI>by profaning the Sabbath?</HI> Nehem. 13.18.</P>
<P>Let those that live in an easie and careless neglect of the holy <HI>Baptism</HI> of CHRIST, for themselves or their children, remember how the <HI>Angel</HI> of the LORD met <HI>Moses</HI> in the <HI>Inn</HI> and threatned to slay him, for his omitting to <HI>circumcise</HI> his son. Exod. 4.24, 25. <Q><HI>Omissions</HI> are sins, and must come into judgment, and particularly the neglect and contempt of the <HI>seals</HI> of the Covenant; for it is a sign we undervalue the <HI>promises</HI> of the Covenant, and are displeas'd with the <HI>conditions</HI> of it.</Q> So Mr. <HI>Henry. Moses</HI> instantly humbled himself, and put the mark of GOD upon his son, and the <HI>angel of death</HI> departed from him.</P>
<P>Some think <HI>Moses</HI> was struck with a <HI>mortal sickness</HI> in the Inn, and GOD let him know that it was for his neglecting to circumcise his child. And we know the threatning of GOD in the day when he gave the law of Circumcision to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 17.14. <HI>The uncircumcised man-child— that soul shall be cut off from my people, he hath broken my covenant.</HI> The threat∣ning had like to have been executed on the excel∣lent <HI>parent</HI> for his omission.</P>
<P>Let those also fear the <HI>judgments of CHRIST</HI> who <HI>never</HI> came to his <HI>Table,</HI> or come <HI>unworthily</HI> thereunto. Are the <HI>judgments of Providence in his hand?</HI> and has he said, <HI>This do in remembrance of me?</HI> and will he not judge men for their <HI>Omission</HI> of this duty? Or has he said again, <HI>Let a man examine himself and so let him eat
<PB N="56" REF="002853_0064_0FE67845D7D30790"/>of that bread and drink of that cup; for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh judgment to him∣self?</HI> and shall we not <HI>judge</HI> our selves that we may not be <HI>judged?</HI> We know how the <HI>Corinthians</HI> were judged for their <HI>irreverence,</HI> 1. Cor. 11.30. <HI>Many were sick and weak</HI> among them, and <HI>some</HI> died. Judge then, (and surely the <HI>coals</HI> in the hand of CHRIST call us to judge our selves) Whether there is not a general faulty <HI>neglect</HI> of the <HI>Table</HI> of <HI>CHRIST</HI> among us? And whether there be not much <HI>unworthy eating and drinking</HI> found with us? — Should not the loud and terrible threatning of judgment bring <HI>both these</HI> to a serious consideration with us? — Surely CHRIST calls many among us to his long neglected <HI>Table,</HI> that his house may be full; and I hope is bringing many to it by the awful alarm which he has given them. And surely he calls all his <HI>Churches</HI> to a more reve∣rend observation of <HI>this,</HI> and every <HI>other</HI> of his Infti∣tutions. Let us remember how <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abibu,</HI> as well as <HI>Corah,</HI> died with their <HI>censers</HI> in their hands; and what the HOLY ONE said thereupon, <HI>I will be sanctified in them that draw nigh me.</HI> Very awful al∣so is his threatning, Levit. 26.14, 15. <HI>If ye will not bearken to me, and will not do all these Commandments; if ye shall despise my statutes, and if your soul abhor my judg∣ments, and you break my covenant; I also will do this unto you, I will even appoint over you terror.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. And lastly, By the terrible <HI>threatning</HI> and the merciful <HI>preservation</HI> in the late amazing <HI>Earthquake,</HI> CHRIST warns us <HI>to get ready for his Coming;</HI> for death, judgment and eternity. Is it not a <HI>sign</HI> to us of the <HI>Son of man,</HI> how quickly and suddenly he may come? Is it not a warning to us to get ready for it? Mat. 24.42. <HI>Watch therefore, for ye know not what hour your LORD doth come: Therefore be ye also ready, for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh:
<PB N="57" REF="002853_0065_0FE678722FDC1728"/>Blessed is that servant whom his LORD when he cometh shall find so doing.</HI> Luke 12 35, 36. <HI>Let your loins be girded about and your lights burning, and be ye as men that wait for their LORD, to open unto him immediately.</HI> Is not this the meaning of his <HI>threatning, "Or I will come upon thee quickly?</HI> and this the language of his <HI>sparing mercy, "Blessed is he that watcheth and keepeth his gar∣ments.</HI></P>
<P>Surely CHRIST meant to give us a very sensible conviction of the <HI>vanity and emptiness of this world</HI> and all the enjoyments of it; and to raise our <HI>affections</HI> to and fix them on <HI>the things that are above, where He is at the right hand of GOD?</HI> O what did <HI>this</HI> world and life and all the things of it seem to us, while the earth was shaking and as it were sinking under us! So let us always look on it as a perishing thing, and far from being any portion for an immortal Creature. 1. John. 2.17. <HI>The world passeth away and the lusts thereof, but he that doeth the will of GOD abideth for ever.</HI> Col. 3.3. <HI>Set your affections on things above, and not on things upon the earth; for ye are dead and your life is hid with CHRIST in GOD; When CHRIST who is your life shall appear then shall ye also appear with him in glory</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Mat. 6.19. 1. Cor. 7 29, — 31.</NOTE></P>
<P>Let us realize it, that there is a more terrible <HI>shake</HI> before us, than that which so lately terrified us; even DEATH! which with a cold but strong hand will shake our souls out of our bodies. And what will it avail us that we have been delivered from an <HI>Earth∣quake</HI> now, if a few days hence the pit below, <HI>the bot∣tomless pit,</HI> open its mouth upon us and swallow us up? What will it avail us that CHRIST grants this <HI>space for repentance,</HI> if after a hard and <HI>impenitent heart</HI> we only treasure up <HI>wrath</HI> against the day of wrath! When it shall be <HI>more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah</HI>
<PB N="58" REF="002853_0066_0FE67845F96AE210"/>than for us; and they that went down <HI>quick</HI> into the pit shall <HI>rise up in judgment</HI> against us and condemn us! What will it signify to us that the <HI>Earth</HI> did not swal∣low us up three weeks agoe, if the day is coming upon us hereafter when we shall <HI>cry to the rocks and mountains to fall upon us and hide us from the face of the LAMB!</HI></P>
<P>The sinners of the <HI>Old world,</HI> on whom the Long, suffering of GOD waited in the days of <HI>Noah,</HI> tho' they perished by a <HI>flood</HI> of water for their impeni∣tence, will fare <HI>better</HI> in the day of judgment than <HI>Gospel sinners.</HI> And the wicked <HI>Sodomites,</HI> who re∣jected the warnings of <HI>Lot</HI>'s righteous and grieved soul from day to day, tho' they perished by <HI>fire</HI> here, yet will hereafter find a more <HI>tolerable</HI> place in hell than Gospel sinners. And the sinners of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> that had such a <HI>Vengeance</HI> taken of them in the first and second destruction of that famous City, yet will be less miserable than <HI>we</HI> in the day of judgment, if we perish in their sins. For the <HI>records</HI> of their sins and of their Judgment is written for our <HI>warning;</HI> and a <HI>Greater</HI> than <HI>Noah</HI> or all the <HI>Prophets</HI> has spoken to us from heaven; and we have seen Him with <HI>the judgments of Providence</HI> in his hand and with the <HI>eternal Judgment</HI> also committed to Him; and at the same time he <HI>invites</HI> us to repentance by all the tenders and arguments of <HI>Grace</HI> that can possibly be made to us; Wherefore of how much <HI>sorer punishment</HI> suppose ye must <HI>we</HI> be tho't worthy, both in this world and in that to come, if we go on impenitently in those sins for which they perished? <HI>Hebrews.</HI> 10.26; — 31.</P>
<P><HI>Let these things sink deep into</HI> our <HI>hearts</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Philip. 4.5. 1 Peter 4.7.2.3.10, — 15.</NOTE> <HI>Let your moderation be known to all men, the LORD is at hand. The end of all things is at hand, be ye therefore sober and

<HEAD>The Earth devoured by the Curse.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Isaiah XXIv. 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Therefore hath the Curse devoured the Earth.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS <HI>Chapter</HI> is fill'd with <HI>lamentation and mourning and woe.</HI> The <HI>burden of the whole earth</HI> it may be called. For tho' it doubt∣less refers more immediately to the <HI>ravages and desolations</HI> made far and near by the sword of the <HI>Assirian,</HI> or the <HI>Babylonian</HI> armies; yet it may seem also designed to represent and bewail the <HI>general Curse</HI> which <HI>sin</HI> has bro't upon the world of mankind.</P>
<P>It begins thus, <HI>Behold the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste, and turneth it upside down;— the land shall be utterly emptied and utterly spoiled;— the world languisheth and fadeth away;— the earth is defiled under the inhabitants thereof; because they have transgressed the law, changed the ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant: Therefore hath the Curse devoured the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>It is GOD's <HI>curse</HI> that is here spoken of; what He has uttered, and which he inflicts. The <HI>subject</HI> of this curse is the <HI>Earth</HI> whereon Mankind dwell: <HI>That</HI> &amp;c its inhabitants are under the curse. The <HI>cause</HI> of the curse is <HI>Sin,</HI> and the holy wrath of GOD which
<PB N="64" REF="002853_0070_0FE67847293B5BE0"/>it provokes. The <HI>curse</HI> is the threatning of the law, the righteous punishment of sin. The <HI>nature</HI> of the curse is described here from the terrible <HI>effects</HI> of it, its <HI>de∣vouring the Earth.</HI> This makes the <HI>Curse,</HI> namely, its devouring and destructive nature.</P>
<P>This is according to the <HI>threatning of GOD</HI> and his Judgment pass'd on <HI>Adam, Cursed is the ground for thy sake.</HI> This became the glory and holiness of the infinite GOD, the Maker and Sovereign of the Uni∣verse.</P>
<P><HI>Doct. That the Curse of the great GOD is come upon the Earth for Man's sin, and hath devoured it.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. There is the <HI>Curse</HI> of the great and holy GOD. <HI>Behold the LORD maketh the Earth empty,</HI> &amp;c. He only hath a <HI>right</HI> to curse, and he alone has <HI>power</HI> to do it. To <HI>Him</HI> it belongs to <HI>curse</HI> and to <HI>bless,</HI> and whom he blesseth are blessed indeed, and his curse is effe∣ctual and takes place. Psalm 94.1. <HI>O LORD God to whom vengeance belongeth.</HI></P>
<P>He made the earth <HI>good</HI> and blessed it: he made <HI>man</HI> holy and happy and blessed him. The curse is of <HI>our selves,</HI> we bro't it on the earth. GOD is the same blessed, holy, good and wise Being, when he curseth as when he blesseth. There is <HI>no shadow of change</HI> in Him. The change is in <HI>us:</HI> We constrain the infinitely pure, wise and righteous ONE to judge thus.</P>
<P>What then is the <HI>Curse</HI> of GOD? It is the holy Anger and Wrath of ALMIGHTY GOD threatned against and inflicted on sinful creatures.</P>
<P N="1">1. There is the <HI>Anger,</HI> wrath and vengeance of GOD in the <HI>Curse.</HI> Nahurn 1.2. <HI>GOD is jealous and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth and is furi∣ous; the LORD will take vengeance on his adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="65" REF="002853_0071_0FE6787A409D3DE8"/>
2. GOD's <HI>threatned</HI> wrath in his <HI>Word,</HI> that is the Curse to <HI>man. The law worketh wrath.</HI> We had not known the <HI>curse</HI> but by the <HI>law,</HI> which <HI>curseth every one that continueth not in all things written in</HI> it, <HI>to do them.</HI> Gal. 3.10. The <HI>threatning</HI> belongs to the <HI>Law,</HI> and contains the <HI>curse.</HI> Deut. 11.26, 28. <HI>Behold I set before you this day a blessing and a curse; a Blessing if ye obey the Commandments of the LORD your GOD; a Curse if ye will not obey.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. The threatned wrath of GOD <HI>inflicted</HI> is the <HI>Curse.</HI> The curse hath <HI>devoured,</HI> says the <HI>Text.</HI> GOD hath performed, and is executing the Threatnings of his Word. It is the <HI>Execution</HI> that gives force and terror to the <HI>Law;</HI> this makes the curse seen and felt and feared. Mal. 4.6. <HI>I come and smite the earth with a Curse.</HI> So ends the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> the ministration of the Law. — Thus the <HI>Curse</HI> is GOD's righteous and terrible wrath, threatned in his word and inflicted by his power.</P>
<P N="2">II. The <HI>curse</HI> is come upon the <HI>Earth</HI> for <HI>Mans sin.</HI> The <HI>subject</HI> and <HI>cause</HI> of the curse is pointed to in the <HI>text, Therefore</HI> hath the curse devoured the earth. It was threatned by GOD in case of <HI>sin,</HI> it was inflicted upon the sin of <HI>man.</HI> Sin provokes GOD to curse, sin highly deserves his curse, and only sin merits and procures it. Sin bro't it on the head of <HI>Angels,</HI> and they beguiled man into it.</P>
<P>There was <HI>no</HI> curse upon the <HI>Earth</HI> till man had sinned: No, but it was full of <HI>blessings.</HI> It was all a <HI>Paradise,</HI> crowned and fill'd with the bounties of GOD. Every thing on it was <HI>very good,</HI> and the <HI>LORD blessed it.</HI> It was a seat of happiness, a garden of <HI>plea∣sure,</HI> while it remained a place of <HI>holiness.</HI> But as <HI>by one man sin enter'd into the world,</HI> so <HI>Death by sin.</HI> Rom. 5.12. The <HI>ourse</HI> is a train of dreadful evils pre∣ceeding <HI>death,</HI> and consequent upon it.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="002853_0072_0FE6784750F60698"/>
The earth belong'd to the <HI>sinner,</HI> and therefore is the <HI>curse</HI> come upon it. GOD made the earth for the sake of his Creature <HI>Man,</HI> and gave it to him for his possession and dominion. And for mans sake GOD cursed the earth, because it belong'd to the sinner. See Gen. 3.17, 18, 19. He yet gives par∣ticular places up to the curse, <HI>for the iniquity of them that dwell therein.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>paradisaic</HI> face of the earth pass'd away with man's innocence and integrity. It was not fit that the sinner should remain in <HI>Eden:</HI> No, he must be <HI>driven out with a flaming sword.</HI> If he be still continu∣ed upon earth that must be changed, to become a place of affliction and pain to him. By sin he <HI>forfeited</HI> the good, with which GOD had filled the earth, and he was deprived thereof. By sin he <HI>deserved</HI> pain, grief and vexation, and the earth was made to minis∣ter it unto him. So he came by <HI>the knowledge of evil</HI> after the Good, by a sad sense and feeling of it. He saw and felt the change without, as well as within himself; and that it was <HI>an evil and bitter thing</HI> that he had sinned.</P>
<P>GOD valu'd not the <HI>Earth</HI> in comparison of <HI>Man,</HI> the owner of it, and his <HI>obedience.</HI> GOD had made him in his <HI>Image,</HI> with much <HI>solemnity</HI> and a divine <HI>pleasure.</HI> GOD had prepar'd and stock'd the earth for him, before he made him. GOD <HI>put it under man's feet,</HI> but reserv'd man's heart and soul for Himself and for heaven. The ruine of <HI>Man</HI> was therefore more to GOD, than if the whole earth and all the creatures in it could have perished without him. A <HI>soul</HI> in the likeness of GOD, an immortal <HI>spirit</HI> capable of know∣ing, loving, serving and enjoying GOD for ever, is more than seas and lands, fish and fowl, beasts and all cattle. What shall be given to GOD, what hath not <HI>he</HI> given, in exchange for a soul?</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="002853_0073_0FE6787A62E797B8"/>
The <HI>Inhabitant</HI> is greater than the <HI>house</HI> he dwells in. <HI>The things that are made,</HI> however great in them∣selves, are yet <HI>less</HI> at last than the <HI>Persons</HI> for whom they are made. The earth may well <HI>dissolve</HI> with its inhabitants.</P>
<P>But at last, the <HI>Glory and honour of GOD</HI> is in value infinitely beyond <HI>Man</HI> and his <HI>Earth</HI> together. <HI>Pereat mundus, sed fiat justitia:</HI> Let GOD be glorified, tho' the earth perish and man with it. GOD has cast down <HI>Angels,</HI> and he will burn up <HI>Worlds,</HI> rather than bear with <HI>sin,</HI> or let it go <HI>unpunished.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The Curse <HI>hath devoured the Earth.</HI> To <HI>devour</HI> is to eat up, consume, destroy, lay waste and deso∣late. It is meant 1. of the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of the Earth, 2. of <HI>that</HI> it self, and 3. of the <HI>good and happiness,</HI> peace and comfort that would have been, or that is yet in the world.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Curse is now <HI>devouring,</HI> and thro' every ge∣neration of man has been devouring, the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of this earth in that <HI>one</HI> vast and comprehensive part of it, <HI>Mortality and death.</HI> This is the very <HI>letter</HI> of the Curse, in the first and short (but O how exten∣sive!) <HI>compendium</HI> of it; <HI>In the day when thou eatest thou shalt surely die.</HI> That is to say, become mortal and miserable.</P>
<P>Number if you can the families and generations of men that have proceeded from the loyns of <HI>mortal. A∣dam:</HI> Where are <HI>they?</HI> what is become of every per∣son that have belonged to them? The <HI>Curse</HI> (that is <HI>Death</HI>) hath slain and devoured them all! the grave has eat 'em up! Unsatisfied death, and the insatia∣able grave, which never says it hath enough.</P>
<P>How many millions of people <HI>die</HI> in every age of the world? not one of these had died but for the <HI>curse!</HI> What is become of all these <HI>buried bodies?</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="002853_0074_0FE6784DF667AC60"/>Death and the worms (that is, the Curse) has <HI>devour'd</HI> them; <HI>into dust they are consum'd away.</HI> Like a thing devour'd they are turn'd into corruption.</P>
<P>They that have liv'd to fifty or sixty year old have almost seen that Generation devour'd which fill'd the earth when they came into it; and this <HI>dragon</HI> stands ready to devour every child of man that is yet to be born.</P>
<P>We read of <HI>death</HI> as the devourer, Psal. 49.14. <HI>Like sheep they are laid in the grave, death shall feed on them.</HI> Prov. 1.12. <HI>Let us swallow them up alive as the grave, and whole as they that go down into the pit.</HI> Hab. 2.5. <HI>Death cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him all na∣tions, and heapeth unto him all people.</HI> Thus Death is the Curse which devoureth the earth.</P>
<P N="2">II. There are <HI>many Plagues</HI> which belong to death and the curse, by which the earth has been and still is devoured. The curse is a quiver full of deadly ar∣rows, some whereof are ever on the string, and flying every moment, directed at the heart of one or other of the sons and daughters of men. It is a vast col∣lection of many woes, and every one of them makes vast destructions. You have them in part enumera∣ted in the 28. of <HI>Deuteronomy; All these curses shall come upon thee and overtake thee; Cursed shalt thou be in the city and cursed in the field; cursed shall be thy basket and thy store; cursed the fruit of thy body and of thy land, the increase of thy kine and of thy sheep; cursed shalt thou he when thou comest in and when thou goest out.</HI></P>
<P>The world had an <HI>Epitomy</HI> of the Curse in the plagues of <HI>Egypt,</HI> those ten plagues which devour'd that serrile Country. Again we have the branches and terrors of the Curse in the <HI>seven last plagues,</HI> the vials of the wrath of GOD: Revel. 15.1. <HI>And I saw another sign in heaven great and marvellous, seven Angels, having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up the
<PB N="69" REF="002853_0075_0FE6787BE9D0E520"/>wrath of GOD.</HI> 16.1. <HI>And I heard a great voice out of the Temple, saying to the seven Angels, Go, pour out the vials upon the earth.</HI> Here is the <HI>vision</HI> of the Curse; beyond the words of men and beyond their fears.</P>
<P>I will single out and name <HI>some</HI> of these <HI>plagues</HI> and curses, which devour the Earth; whereof <HI>how little a part</HI> is known by us, and how little can the <HI>least part</HI> be described by us.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>War</HI> is one part of the Curse; one cruel and woful thing whereby it has devour'd the earth. From the days of <HI>Nimrod</HI> it has been ravaging and devour∣ing; slaying its thousands and ten thousands, laying waste Cities and Provinces. One devouring <HI>Beast</HI> and another have been the true <HI>Images</HI> of war. So the successive <HI>Monarchies</HI> and <HI>Tynannies</HI> are represented in the book of <HI>Daniel.</HI> Such a devouring beast was the <HI>Assirian</HI> first; and then the <HI>Babylonian Empire;</HI> and such the <HI>Grecian</HI> Victors, <HI>Alexander</HI> and his <HI>Captains;</HI> and then the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> which swallow'd up all in its turn; till at last it <HI>prey'd</HI> upon it self and be∣came a <HI>morsel</HI> to barbarous nations. And thus the sword goes on devouring for ever: The destructions are perpetual and never like to come to an end. Death and the curse have even subsisted upon the wars, which have murder'd the nations of men. The labours and fruits of the field are the least part of its devouring; It makes <HI>its arrows drunk with blood,</HI> and <HI>the sword devours flesh.</HI> Would you see the Earth de∣vour'd? you have it, Dan. 7.23. <HI>And the fourth beast shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down and break it in pieces.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>pestilence,</HI> that invisible sword of death, <HI>which walketh in darkness,</HI> is another <HI>form</HI> of the Curse which devours the earth. If <HI>war</HI> has slain its thou∣sands, <HI>Diseases</HI> have their ten thousand. Who can number the hosts of the various kinds of mortal sick∣nesses
<PB N="70" REF="002853_0076_0FE7519D32BAA9F0"/>and distempers, to which our bodies are here liable? How many millions of lives do they silently sweep away every day and week. The plague in the camp of <HI>Israel</HI> carried off in an <HI>hour</HI> 14700 souls; and in one <HI>night</HI> the Angel of death slew in the <HI>Assirian</HI> Camp 184000. In <HI>three days</HI> pestilence GOD can kill as many, as in <HI>three years</HI> famine, or in <HI>three months</HI> flying before an enemy. Deut. 28.22. <HI>Every sickness and every plague shall he bring upon thee, until he have consumed thee.</HI> I suppose <HI>that</HI> threatning to be more than literally fulfilled from age to age, Ezek. 5.12. <HI>A third part of thee shall die by the pestilence:</HI> i. e. by sickness of one kind and other. So the wrath of the <HI>Almighty</HI> in the destruction of the lives of men is re∣presented, Hab. 3.5, 6. <HI>Before him went the pestilence and burning coals</HI> (i. e. Fevers) <HI>at his feet: And he stood and measured the earth:</HI> i. e. gave over such a propor∣tion of the lives upon it to the pestilence: <HI>I heard</HI> (adds the Prophet) <HI>and my belly trembled, and rottenness enter'd into my bones.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Famine</HI> and the causes of it are another part of the curse which devours the earth. The numbers that die of famine are not equal to those that die in <HI>war,</HI> or by <HI>sickness.</HI> It would be dreadful if it were so: for better it is to die of <HI>these</HI> than of that. There are troops of plagues to introduce a famine; the land is devour'd before it comes. The <HI>lean kine</HI> and the <HI>blas∣ted ears,</HI> devouring the fat and the <HI>rank stalk,</HI> is the <HI>rueful image</HI> of this plague. <HI>Drought</HI> or sweeping <HI>rains</HI> devour the earth and <HI>leave no food. The fire devours the pasture, and the flame burns up the trees of the field.</HI> Joel. 1.19. Again <HI>the seed rots under the clods</HI> by excess of rain, <HI>and the garners are laid desolate: Alas for the day! for as a destruction from the Almighty shall it come! how do the beasts groan, and the cattle are perplexed!</HI> If GOD send the <HI>locust,</HI> or the <HI>caterpillar,</HI> or <HI>worms</HI> of various kind, they ear up every green thing. These
<PB N="71" REF="002853_0077_0FE64591B05CFF28"/>he calls the <HI>devourer:</HI> Mal. 3. II. A most proper name truly, and very formidable. Psalm. 105.34.35. <HI>He spake and the locusts came, and caterpillars without number; and did eat up all the herbs of their land, and de∣vour'd the fruit of their ground.</HI> 2. Chron. 7.13. <HI>If I shut up heaven and there be no rain, or if I command the locusts to devour the land.</HI> A very signal part of the curse, <HI>Famine</HI> in all the causes of it.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Earthquakes, storms</HI> and <HI>inundations</HI> belong to the Curse which devours the earth. The <HI>LORD has his way</HI> in these, and they are dreadful executioners of his wrath and holy vengeance. They are irresisti∣ble destroyers, before which there is no standing and opposing, and from which there is no flying. The <HI>earthquake</HI> swallows up all before it, and the fierce <HI>wind</HI> bears down all before it, and the <HI>inundation</HI> rolls over all that stands in its way. Nahum. 1. init. <HI>The LORD hath his way in the whirlwind, and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet: — The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth is burnt at his presence; yea the world and all that dwell therein: Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</HI></P>
<P>The earth was devour'd in the days of <HI>Noah</HI> by earthquakes and inundations; The earth sank, and <HI>the fountains of the great deep were broken up.</HI> In like manner the plains of <HI>Sodom</HI> were turned into a stan∣ding water. This <HI>overflowing Scourge</HI> is ever in the hand of GOD, Psalm. 18.7, —12. Isai. 29.6. And every year almost we hear of some threatnings or executions of the <HI>Curse</HI> after this kind, which should GOD increase and multiply how soon would the earth be <HI>devoured</HI> by it? — Thus there are <HI>many plagues</HI> which belong to the curse, and which devour the earth.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="72" REF="002853_0078_0FE6784E1CBC0888"/>
III. The curse has once already devoured the whole earth by a <HI>flood of waters,</HI> and will devour it again by <HI>fire,</HI> in the <HI>Conflagration</HI> at the last day. <HI>Twice</HI> will the Curse effect a universal dissolution of the earth. <HI>One woe is past</HI> long since, and the <HI>other cometh quickly.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Flood</HI> devoured the Earth in the days of <HI>Noah,</HI> and it was the <HI>Curse</HI> of GOD for the sins of mankind that did it. So it is at large related to us in the <HI>sixth</HI> and <HI>seventh</HI> Chapters of <HI>Genesis.</HI> It is compu∣ted by <HI>learned men,</HI> that there might then be living on the earth as great a number of people as are alive upon it at this day, by reason of the <HI>Longevity</HI> before the flood: But however that were, yet we must sup∣pose many Millions of men women and children then drown'd together. They sank by shoals innumera∣ble. At the same time the waters <HI>tore</HI> the ground to pieces, and left it a mighty <HI>ruine,</HI> as its <HI>shores</HI> do shew at this day. <HI>Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered; at the re∣buke of the LORD, at the blast of the breath of his nostrils. He made darkness his secret place, and his pavilion round about him were dark waters and thick clouds of the sky.</HI> Psalm 18.</P>
<P>My <HI>context,</HI> as well as <HI>Psalm</HI> now quoted seems to point us to this very Instance, <HI>the flood;</HI> for then in∣deed it was that <HI>the LORD made the earth empty</HI> (a kind of second <HI>Chaos) and perverted the face of it: It was moved exceedingly, and was clean dissolved: It reel'd to and fro like a drunkard, and was removed like a cottage:</HI> It sank under <HI>the transgression</HI> of men which was <HI>heavy upon it.</HI> Yet it rose again by the power and patience of GOD; but bears the unsightly and mortal marks of the Curse.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Curse</HI> will once more devour the earth in
<PB N="73" REF="002853_0079_0FE6787EF3081E10"/>the last <HI>Conflagration,</HI> when the heavens and earth that now are shall be burnt up.</P>
<P>The <HI>Philosophers</HI> and the <HI>Poets,</HI> both <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans,</HI> have in their writings preserved the <HI>tradition</HI> both of the <HI>flood</HI> which has once devoured the earth, and of the <HI>fire</HI> that will again do it. But it is the <HI>Holy Scripture</HI> which has taught us to believe it; more es∣pecially those famous words of the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> 2 Pet. 3.7,—12. <HI>But the heavens and earth which are now, are reserved unto fire against the day of judgment, and perdition of ungodly men:— The day of the LORD will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the earth also and the works that are therein shall be burnt up.</HI> Here the <HI>end</HI> of the earth by fire is positively declared, and it will be a <HI>deluge</HI> of fire. The <HI>means</HI> of it are to us unknown, and af∣ter our best <HI>reasonings</HI> about it altogether uncertain. Whether the LORD will rain down fire and brim∣stone as he did on <HI>Sodom,</HI> or whether the <HI>fires</HI> within the earth shall break forth and pour out mighty streams of flaming sulphur, or whether some awful <HI>Comet,</HI> like that which some of us saw in the year 1680, passing (as that did they say) into the flames of the <HI>Sun,</HI> may come <HI>blazing</HI> down upon this wicked Earth of ours, and set it in a flame at once. GOD only knows the time and means of this Event, and has them in his power; but the thing is decreed, and in its time will be performed; and the earth will be <HI>devoured,</HI> melted and dissolved <HI>by the fire of the Divine jealousie.</HI> Zeph. 3.8. <HI>The Day will burn as an oven, and all that do wickedly shall be as the stubble.</HI> Mal. 4.1. "The flames will drink up the very <HI>sea,</HI> says a learned <HI>Author,</HI> and run down the <HI>mountains</HI> and <HI>rocks</HI> into burning <HI>Oar.</HI>" And then the <HI>Curse</HI> will have <HI>devour∣ed</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="002853_0080_0FE6784F7AC24068"/>the Earth a <HI>second</HI> time; and <HI>there shall be no more Curse for ever</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Here this <HI>Sermon</HI> may be divided.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The <HI>latent hidden Curse</HI> is at last <HI>in mens Souls,</HI> their vitiated minds and wild passions, their wicked and ungodly lusts, whereby they become <HI>plagues</HI> and <HI>curses</HI> to one another now, and will be (without re∣pentance) <HI>devoured</HI> by the Curse of GOD in the <HI>Judgment of the great Day.</HI></P>
<P><HI>One sinner destroyed much good,</HI> spoiling himself and all about him of all the comfort, happiness and peace that the Earth has to give. From whence come <HI>wars</HI> which devour the earth? <HI>come they not of mens lusts that war in their members?</HI> their pride, ambition, co∣vetousness, hatred and revenge? What devouring <HI>beast of prey</HI> is there in the <HI>woods,</HI> like to a <HI>Sennacherib,</HI> or a <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> among men? — Or what is it that devours the <HI>private</HI> good of persons, towns, fa∣milies and provinces, like mens private gains and in∣terests, their envies and emulations, hatreds and wraths? they defraud and oppress, <HI>bite and devour</HI> one another, and so are <HI>consumed</HI> one of another. The <HI>plague</HI> is in the <HI>heart,</HI> tho' few <HI>feel</HI> it in themselves, whereby they become a <HI>curse</HI> to themselves and others.</P>
<P>And for <HI>this</HI> the <HI>Day</HI> is coming when the Wrath of GOD will devour <HI>souls;</HI> the <HI>day of the perdition of un∣godly men.</HI> In that fearful day the Curse will devour <HI>all</HI> that have ever lived upon the earth, save a small <HI>remnant</HI> according to the election of Grace.</P>
<P>The <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> part of the Curse is emi∣nently <HI>the Curse.</HI> The outward and <HI>temporal</HI> plagues, how many soever they be and dreadful, are as nothing to <HI>that.</HI> A <HI>body</HI> liable to a devouring <HI>grave</HI> is nothing, in comparison of an <HI>Immortal Soul</HI> in a state of <HI>spiritual
<PB N="75" REF="002853_0081_0FE6787F1B8AB090"/>death</HI> and liable to <HI>the second and eternal Death.</HI> That devours <HI>soul and body</HI> too, with an <HI>everlasting</HI> destruc∣tion, and therefore is infinitely terrible. Mat. 10.28.</P>
<P>The <HI>last</HI> and <HI>full</HI> execution of the curse is that <HI>fiery indignation which shall devour</HI> the enemies of GOD after the day of Judgment. Then <HI>death and hell,</HI> lost souls and damned devils, shall be <HI>cast</HI> together into <HI>the lake of fire, and the smoke of their torment shall ascend for ever and ever.</HI> The Curse is finally that, Mat. 25. ult. <HI>Depart ye cursed into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</HI></P>
<P>O how <HI>few</HI> out of the world of mankind will <HI>escape</HI> this <HI>devouring fire,</HI> these <HI>everlasting burnings? Lord! are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> few</HI> that shall be <HI>saved</HI> from it! How many <HI>thousands of millions</HI> will sink down together into hell under the heavy wrath of GOD in that terrible day! And when <HI>these</HI> perish from the earth and from under these heavens, compared with whom <HI>Those that shall he redeemed from the earth</HI> are but a small number, then the <HI>Earth will be devoured by the Curse</HI> in the most wo∣ful sense: For what is the whole <HI>Earth</HI> to these <HI>Souls?</HI></P>
<P>USE. I come now to some brief <HI>Improvement</HI> of this awful <HI>Doctrine.</HI> And</P>
<P N="1">1. Let us see the <HI>hideous, ugly and detestable face of sin and of satan</HI> in the devouring Curse.</P>
<P N="1">1. Of <HI>sin:</HI> What a <HI>cursed</HI> thing is it? and what a dreadful <HI>Curse</HI> to Man and to the Earth? SIN is the devourer of <HI>both:</HI> That is the parent and cause of the curse: That bro't forth the <HI>Dragon.</HI> Whatever the Curse hath done, or hereafter shall do, to the bodies or souls of men, must be all charged on their accursed sins.</P>
<P>Hence we must estimate the great Evil there was in the <HI>first sin</HI> of man, by which death and hell entered.
<PB N="76" REF="002853_0082_0FE6784FA11C2E58"/>For <HI>in Adam all die, and by the offence of One judgment is come upon all men.</HI> Well said the holy <HI>Judge</HI> to the <HI>woman,</HI> who was <HI>first</HI> in the transgression, <HI>What hast thou done?</HI> It may seem to some of her foolish chil∣dren but a <HI>smal</HI> sin, to take and <HI>taste</HI> of the forbidden tree as she did: But the <HI>Curse</HI> consequent thereon gives us a terrible proof that it was a <HI>great</HI> trans∣gression.</P>
<P>We see <HI>Original sin</HI> in the Curse devouring the earth; that we are <HI>by nature children of wrath.</HI> The curse devours <HI>Infants</HI> in the womb, and the pains and death of the new born <HI>babes</HI> shews that they are <HI>shapen in iniquity and conceived in sin.</HI> Yet these seem to have known least of the <HI>Curse:</HI> Job. 3.10. <HI>Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid sorrow from my eyes.</HI></P>
<P>In all the bitter <HI>sorrows</HI> and grievous <HI>afflictions</HI> of our lives we feel the <HI>Curse.</HI> The effects must lead us back to the cause, and we see GOD judging us for our sins<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Levit. 26.41. Lam. 1, 14, 18.</NOTE>: <HI>The yoke of my transgression is bound by his hand: The LORD is righteous, for I have rebelled against him.</HI> We may not say of this or that particular per∣son, at least very rarely, that GOD visits them for these or those particular sins; or that <HI>they are sinners above others:</HI> But we may and should every one judge himself before GOD when we are under his judgments; And as for a particular place or <HI>People</HI> judged by the LORD we may freely say, <HI>Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; This is thy wickedness and it is bitter.</HI> Jer. 4.18.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let the <HI>Curse</HI> shew us the ugly and detestable face of <HI>satan.</HI> In this his own glass see the accursed <HI>fiend;</HI> his enmity to GOD and GOD's hatred of him, his cruel hatred to <HI>man</HI> and malice against him.
<PB N="77" REF="002853_0083_0FE6788087933968"/>He the <HI>tempter</HI> is the <HI>Abaddon</HI> and devourer. He maliciously seduced <HI>Eve</HI> into sin, to bring the <HI>curse of GOD</HI> upon the earth and on all her posterity. For this GOD will never forgive him, nor should we. He was <HI>a murderer from the beginning,</HI> and still goeth about <HI>as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.</HI> This is the <HI>great red dragon,</HI> whose <HI>tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven</HI> after him; and the <HI>Manchild</HI> on earth he <HI>stands ready to devour.</HI> Rev. 12.4. He is the <HI>Original of sin and misery in both worlds.</HI> What a horrid <HI>face</HI> is this? Draw <HI>this</HI> likewise, <HI>That he can never repent.</HI> Let him bear the <HI>curse</HI> for ever, has the righteous GOD said, who bro't it on the <HI>earth,</HI> and on the lov'd race of <HI>Men.</HI> The utmost curse of <HI>man</HI> is, to depart accursed to <HI>him.</HI> He must answer in the day of Judgment, as for his own apostacy, so for all the sins and woes that have fill'd this earth of ours. The <HI>Son of man</HI> will judge him in the great day, and revenge upon him this implacable and un∣pardonable enmity to GOD and wrong to man.</P>
<P N="2">II. See the <HI>Grace of our Lord JESUS CHRIST,</HI> and the <HI>mercy of GOD thro' him.</HI> O the height and depth of <HI>redeeming love!</HI> how unsearchable is it? Contemplate it in the following things, and be rapt in holy asto∣nishment and thankfulness.</P>
<P>The SON OF GOD has in our nature been <HI>made sin,</HI> and <HI>born the curse,</HI> that he might <HI>save us from the curse.</HI> 2. Cor. 5.21. Gal. 3.13. Great is this <HI>mystery of Godliness,</HI> this triumph of <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> united! <HI>the Angels of heaven desire to look into it!</HI> they look and worship (and so must we) before the <HI>Mercy-seat.</HI></P>
<P>To CHRIST it is owing that the earth is not <HI>utterly</HI> devoured by the Curse. It stands by his merits; and thro' his obedience and death we sinners are under the care and bounties of <HI>Providence.</HI> The covenant of Providence is built upon the covenant of Grace,
<PB N="78" REF="002853_0084_0FE67856DF5485E8"/>and the <HI>rain bow</HI> covers the throne of the <HI>Redeemer.</HI> All the forbearance of GOD to us, and all his salva∣tions from day to day, are from his great <HI>propitiation.</HI> Therefore <HI>day and night, summer and winter, seed time and harvest do not fail.</HI></P>
<P>Nay our Lord JESUS has <HI>destroyed</HI> the devouring <HI>curse</HI> as to all that <HI>believe</HI> in him; and he will <HI>finish</HI> the destruction of it at his <HI>second</HI> Coming, and in the resurrection of the <HI>Just.</HI> Then he will <HI>swallow up death in victory.</HI></P>
<P>He delivers <HI>souls</HI> from the curse now; from the power of sin and from a state of condemnation. He delivereth also from the <HI>wrath to come.</HI></P>
<P>The glory of CHRIST and of redeening Grace is at last this, That to believers in him <HI>there is no more curse.</HI> They may have sorrow and grief, pain and torment, they may be sick and die; <HI>Earthquakes</HI> may swallow them, and the <HI>grave</HI> devour their bodies; but the Day is coming when <HI>there shall be no more curse.</HI> Revel. 22.3. There are <HI>remains</HI> of sin and of the curse here in the body, but out of it not the least remain of either for ever and ever.</P>
<P N="3">III. Is the Curse <HI>devouring</HI> the earth for mans sin? see the lamentable <HI>hardness</HI> of sinners in their <HI>impeni∣tency.</HI> Altho' men see the earth they live on <HI>devour'd</HI> by the curse, yet they will not repent. As <HI>Pharaoh</HI> saw his kingdom destroyed by one <HI>plague</HI> and another, and yet <HI>hardned his heart.</HI> GOD highly resents this in his own people, Amos. 4.10, 11, 12. <HI>Yet have ye not returned to me saith the LORD!</HI> tho' <HI>I overthrew some of you as</HI> I did <HI>Sodom and Gomorrah! Wherefore thus will I do unto you,</HI> and <HI>prepare to meet thy GOD O Israel!</HI> This is <HI>the Iniquity that is not purged,</HI> but men persist in it <HI>till they die.</HI></P>
<P>Men are and act as if there were <HI>no curse,</HI> no sin or misery, upon earth. They <HI>spend their days in mirth,
<PB N="79" REF="002853_0085_0FE67880AB309848"/>and in a moment go down to the grave.</HI> This is deeply resented by GOD, with just anger and from his ten∣der compassions to us: Ezek. 21.9, 10, 11. <HI>Son of man, A sword is sharpned and furbished: It shall be upon my people: Terrors shall be on them: Smite thou on thy thigh.</HI> So our LORD <HI>wept</HI> over the insensible <HI>City,</HI> nigh unto destruction.</P>
<P>Every impenitent sinner is <HI>under</HI> the Curse. Hell is open before him, and <HI>the wrath of GOD abideth on him.</HI> Destruction upon destruction must be cried in his ears. And O that sinners under the <HI>Gospel</HI> would consider how nearly the curse concerns <HI>them,</HI> how dreadfully it threatens and hangs over them more than others! and how heavy it will ly upon them for ever if they die impenitent and unpardoned. — You that have heard and known the curses of GOD's law, and have been warned and <HI>perswaded by the terrors of GOD!</HI> You that have seen the <HI>flying roll</HI> as it is <HI>spread</HI> abroad in the <HI>Book of GOD;</HI> seen the length and the breadth of it, as it <HI>goeth over the face of the whole earth!</HI> how should you fear its entring into thy <HI>house</HI> and thy <HI>soul!</HI></P>
<P>Be exhorted therefore to an instant earnest and deep <HI>repentance.</HI> Think <HI>who hath warned you,</HI> how GOD hath warned you, <HI>to flee from the wrath to come!</HI> Ly no longer securely and profanely in a state of sin and misery, quiet and at ease under the curse of GOD. Wilt thou not <HI>fear</HI> under this <HI>Condemnation?</HI> O <HI>turn</HI> and look unto the crucified JESUS, that he would <HI>remember thee from his Kingdom!</HI> See how he <HI>bore</HI> the Curse to <HI>save</HI> thee from it!</P>
<P>May I not say, <HI>This</HI> is the <HI>voice</HI> of GOD unto <HI>City</HI> and <HI>Country</HI> in the late fearful and terrible <HI>Earthquake,</HI> which but <HI>four</HI> nights ago ran thro' the <HI>Land,</HI> and threaten'd every <HI>Town,</HI> every <HI>Family</HI> and ever <HI>Person</HI> with a sudden destruction. When the hollow trem∣bling Earth <HI>roar'd</HI> so in our ears, when the ground
<PB N="80" REF="002853_0086_0FE6785705A96AC8"/><HI>shook</HI> to a fearful degree under us, and our houses over our heads; when the earth threaten'd in a moment to open its mouth and swallow us up, and our houses threaten'd to fall upon us and crush us to death; when we feared that we might instantly go down, we and our children and housholds, our neighbours and friends together into the pit; buried in the ruines of our fallen dwellings; the <HI>Godly</HI> like the pious Sons and Daughters of <HI>Job</HI> on whom the house fell, the <HI>wicked</HI> like <HI>Dathan</HI> &amp; <HI>Abiram</HI> whose tents and families the earth swallowed up at once. What the voice of GOD then was to every impenitent sinner let his own <HI>Conscience</HI> tell him! Conscience, which was a <HI>swist witness</HI> in that amazing minute; and bro't thy sins to remembrance, set thee to the <HI>bar</HI> of CHRIST, and cast thee at the foot of mercy. What were thy in∣stant cries for sparing and pardoning mercy in that trying moment! Speak <HI>Conscience,</HI> and tell sinners a∣gain GOD's voice to them in that astonishing Dis∣pensation.</P>
<P>I call it not a <HI>Judgment,</HI> but a <HI>Threatning</HI> and loud <HI>Warning</HI> of deserved judgment; a <HI>mid night cry</HI> to awaken us out of a <HI>sleep</HI> in sin, the sleep of death: And then it will eventually prove a <HI>Mercy,</HI> the great∣est mercy, the happiest minute, of our whole life.</P>
<P>GOD from the bowels of the earth preach'd a startling <HI>Sermon</HI> to us; we heard and quaked; as when he spake from the <HI>shaking Mountain</HI> of old unto his people; so we heard his voice and <HI>were afraid.</HI> O might the impressions be <HI>saving</HI> on us, sanctifying and lasting, and never wear off!</P>
<P>Our GOD has shown us his greatness and power, his holiness and justice, his great goodness and tender mercies: <HI>Say unto GOD how terrible art thou in thy works! thro' the greatness of thy power shall thy enemies submit themselves unto thee. All the earth shall worship thee and shall sing unto thee; they shall sing to thy name.
<PB N="81" REF="002853_0087_0FE67887002AE478"/>Come and see the works of GOD: He is terrible in his doings to the children of men. He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations: Let not the rebellious exalt themselves. O bless our GOD ye people, and make the voice of his praise to be heard: which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to be moved.</HI> Psalm. 66.4, —9.</P>
<P>What a <HI>singular</HI> thing is it and very extraordinary, that there is scarce a person now thro' the whole land, but has heard the terrible voice of GOD in a dreadful earthquake? that as was said to <HI>Israel, Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice,</HI> so I may say to you, From the bowels of the earth he has made us to hear it, <HI>and that a mighty voice!</HI> the earth cried out to us of our sins, as a heavy burthen, <HI>too heavy</HI> to be born; it groan'd and <HI>travailed in pain,</HI> as wanting to be delivered.</P>
<P>The call of GOD in such a Providence is general and <HI>universal,</HI> to every person, (man, woman and child) and every family, in every part of the land. The blow was immediately at every ones <HI>life,</HI> at eve∣ry sinners heart, and at the life of his <HI>soul;</HI> This night, this instant shall it be requir'd.—At the life of all <HI>thine</HI> with thee was the sword pointed, those that are dearest to thee and <HI>as thy own soul:</HI> As at the perishing of the <HI>rebels in Israel,</HI> their <HI>wives</HI> and <HI>little ones</HI> went down together, <HI>and all Israel fled at their cry.</HI> In what <HI>confusion</HI> did they die? without time for one regular cry to GOD for mercy.</P>
<P>Nothing is like <HI>terrible,</HI> take the Judgment in all its parts together, as to be swallow'd up alive by an <HI>earthquake.</HI> Indeed death in some other form may be as <HI>sudden,</HI> and so as <HI>awful</HI> to him that dies; but this is to many, to hundreds, to thousands together, as GOD orders it.—The cry of <HI>fire</HI> is frightful to us; but what is a Nei'bour's house on sire, or our own,
<PB N="82" REF="002853_0088_0FE6785881D4B448"/>to our houses falling on us, or sinking with us, in an instant? In <HI>storms</HI> and <HI>inundations</HI> the winds and waters usually rise gradually, but an <HI>Earthquake</HI> gives no notice of its approach; nor is there any means of escaping as in most other judgments, nor time to call upon GOD.</P>
<P>And yet let me tell you, There's a <HI>day</HI> coming upon every one of us, more dreadful than an earth∣quake to impenitent sinners; I mean the day of <HI>Death</HI> and the day of <HI>Judgment.</HI></P>
<P>Are not the <HI>convulsions</HI> of death within the body of a sinner equal to the quaking of universal nature round about him? when the <HI>the earthly bouse of this Tabernacle is dissolving,</HI> and his soul rending from his body! when the grave opens to swallow up his body, and hell is open before him to devour his soul! Sup∣pose you could see an <HI>earthquake</HI> coming on at a day or two distance of time, but you knew that you and your houshold must then be swal∣low'd up: <HI>Death</HI> is all this to persons, families, towns and provinces. <HI>It dashes the fathers and the sons together, nor pities, nor spares, nor hath mercy:</HI> As the Prophet speaks Jer. 13.14, 15, 16. <HI>Wherefore hear ye and give ear; be not proud, for the LORD hath spoken; Give glory to the LORD your GOD before be cause darkness, and your feet stumble on the dark mountains; and while ye look for light he turn it into the shadow of death, and make it gross darkness.</HI></P>
<P>But the day of <HI>Judgment</HI> is the day of terror; when the <HI>graves</HI> shall open at the voice of CHRIST, and the <HI>seas</HI> too, and throw up their dead, <HI>spue</HI> out the vile bodies of the wicked; which would be glad then if the earth would kindly open again, and cover them for ever from the face and wrath of the <HI>Lamb.</HI> Then the most <HI>fearless</HI> and audacious sinners that are or have been on earth, <HI>the Captains and the mighty men,</HI> with all their ungodly train of dependents, <HI>every bond man</HI>
<PB N="83" REF="002853_0089_0FE6788721C10978"/>of the same character for impiety and impenitence, <HI>shall fly to the rocks and mountains and call on them to fall on 'em and bide them.</HI> Rev. 6.15.</P>
<P>Was the sudden noise of the Earthquake terrible t'other night? much more will the <HI>day of the LORD</HI> be so which <HI>comes as a thief in the night, wherein the hea∣vens shall pass away with a great noise.</HI> 2 Pet. 3 10. What will the noise of a <HI>dissolving world</HI> be?—O realize it, <HI>sinner!</HI> there is something infinitely worse before thee than the worst of earthquakes except thou repent.</P>
<P>But I said that I did not call it a <HI>Judgment,</HI> but a <HI>warning</HI> and threatning of judgment, and a <HI>call</HI> to <HI>re∣pentance.</HI> It had been a terrible judgment if GOD had suffer'd it to go further, as he easily could, and was eno' provoked by our sins. And the wonder was that it went no further. If our houses had fallen and buried us; if many had sunk together into the earth or been crushed to death, as in our time it was at <HI>Jamaica,</HI> and lately at <HI>Palermo</HI> a great City in <HI>Italy;</HI> how dreadful had the judgment been?</P>
<P>But O the <HI>mercy!</HI> the wonder of mercy! that after such a shock we do not hear of one house fallen, nor of a single life lost, nor of a broken bone! GOD has only shook his rod terribly over us, and we must say —<HI>to us Goodness!</HI> while we think of the <HI>severity</HI> to others, who were <HI>not greater sinners</HI> than we, when we compare our light and means for repentance with theirs.</P>
<P>And I trust GOD means this Providence in <HI>mercy</HI> to many, and of great <HI>glory</HI> to Himself in their con∣version and salvation. So it may be among the great∣est <HI>favours</HI> of Providence that the land ever saw. And if it be not thus, it will be a dreadful <HI>spiritual</HI> judgment, as the <HI>rod</HI> of <HI>Moses</HI> was to <HI>Pharaoh.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="002853_0090_0FE67858A84D0C10"/>
The <HI>present Impressions</HI> on the minds and hearts of all sorts of Persons by this shake, on young and old, godly and wicked, is a token for good. What prayers, with praises and thanksgivings, have been going up to heaven from persons, from families, and from crowded Assemblies and Congregations; with eager eyes and hearts, and from many a fervent and gracious one! It looks as if GOD had ordained to himself <HI>praise and strength from the mouths of babes and sucklings</HI> for the present: But O how soon may the fearful minute be forgotten, and this sudden impressi∣on wear off? It will certainly do so if GOD do not graciously fasten it by the power of his SPIRIT on our hearts; which we must earnestly beg of him with in∣cessant supplications, and be often looking back on that <HI>night of trembling,</HI> and call to mind what our apprehensions, pravers and tho'ts then were; and of∣ten put our housholds on thinking over their sober tho'ts and fervent holy desires and purposes (by the grace of GOD) at that time.</P>
<P>Indeed such <HI>extraordinary</HI> things are not the ordina∣ry means of <HI>conversion</HI> to sinners. They may be so, and they ought to be so; but the impressions of sud∣den frights and surprizing terrors are apt as suddenly and strangely to wear off. If men hear not <HI>Moses and the Prophets,</HI> the preached <HI>Gospel,</HI> neither will they be persuaded tho' one should come to them <HI>from the dead.</HI> The congregation of <HI>Israel</HI> lay quaking before the burning and shaking <HI>Mountain,</HI> but how few of them were suitably or savingly affected with what they saw and heard? Yea tho' they had a <HI>Moses</HI> with them, to teach and warn and entreat them.</P>
<P>Again, One day the sinners in <HI>Israel</HI> fled at the cry of sinking <HI>Dathan</HI> and <HI>Abiram,</HI> but the very next day they fell a murmuring again, and called <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> the murderers of the LORD's people.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="002853_0091_0FE6788994DF1808"/>
Yet in the hand of the SPIRIT, and by his bles∣sing on the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> this Providence may be∣come an effectual means for convincing and convert∣ing sinners, and for the building up of saints in faith and holiness to eternal life. GOD of his infinite mercy grant it may be so.</P>
<P>He has used one more <HI>Means</HI> with us, if we will be wro't upon by things <HI>extraordinary;</HI> and the Year has been filled with many <HI>such</HI> means, even <HI>thunder and tempest and the flame of devouring fire.</HI> O that there were such an heart in us! this was GOD's own wish respecting his trembling and promising people before the burning mountain; but it strongly intimated to them how deceitful their hearts were, and how little would come of their sudden promises and hopes of a perpetual future obedience.</P>
<P>If great terror and great goodness together will affect us and work on us, we shall be wro't upon. But these united will effect nothing without GOD's powerful hand.</P>
<P>Did ever any people see or hear or feel such a shock of the earth, from one end of the Land to the other, and yet no hurt done to man or beast? They that have been in earthquakes in other places, in <HI>Ja∣maica</HI> and in <HI>Italy</HI> tell us, that they never felt, heard and saw the like. <HI>It is the LORD's doing and marvel∣lous in our eyes.</HI></P>
<P>Who of us is there that can now wish GOD had not done this! It was terrible for the time, may it be joyous in the fruits and remembrance of it. Every one is ready to say, <HI>LORD that I may never forget it!</HI> Ask <HI>this</HI> of GOD humbly, and beg of him an expe∣rience of saving good from it.</P>
<P>If it have not a <HI>sanctifying</HI> effect on us, (as was hin∣ted before) it will have a <HI>bad</HI> one, which GOD for∣bid! If it be not for the <HI>better</HI> to us, it will be for the <HI>worse;</HI> like the <HI>other</HI> means that GOD uses with men
<PB N="86" REF="002853_0092_0FE6786021FCED80"/>for their spiritual good. If we do not improve <HI>this</HI> call and warning of GOD <HI>from below</HI> to us, after the <HI>many</HI> we have had from <HI>above;</HI> it will aggravate our guilt now and our condemnation hereafter. We must answer for <HI>this</HI> also in the day of Judgment, That after the publick Instructions of the last <HI>Lord's day,</HI> GOD came at <HI>night</HI> to every family and to every person, and spake to them from the <HI>Deep</HI> that lieth under; and if yet we <HI>repent not to give him glory</HI> and to save our selves from wrath and ruine, we shall <HI>receive the greater damnation.</HI></P>
<P>I now close my <HI>Discourse,</HI> as it hath pleased the HOLY GHOST to do the <HI>Scriptures</HI> of the <HI>Old Testa∣ment: Words</HI> worthy of our most serious attention and consideration: Words full of <HI>terror</HI> to the wicked and impenitent, and as full of <HI>comfort</HI> to the penitent and obedient: Words full of proper <HI>warning</HI> and <HI>instruction</HI> unto both: Mal. IV. <HI>For behold the Day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea and all that do wickedly shall be stubblc; and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the LORD of hosts; that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall.—Behold I send you Elijah the Prophet be∣fore the coming of the great and dreadful day of the LORD: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and SMITE THE EARTH WITH A CURSE.</HI></P>
