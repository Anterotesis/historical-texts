</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE eternal Jehovah ruleth in the armies of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his hand, or may say unto him, What dost thou? But his government of his church, hath ever been distinct from his general government of the world. And from his calling Israel out of Egypt, unto the building of his temple by Solomon, their nation was a growing church, distinct from all other na∣tions upon earth. But because Solomon set up high places for idolatry, God rent away ten tribes from his son; and both kingdoms were followed with warnings and corrections, until they were all destroyed or carried into captivity. And the king∣dom of Israel never returned from captivity as a nation, but only as individuals; and the kingdom of Judah was always tributary to heathen na∣tions, until Christ came, exactly according to the voices of the prophets concerning him. Yet when he came, the teachers and rulers of the Jews were
<PB N="6" REF="024061_0005_0FC2FCFA30334F48"/>all against him; and after he had cleansed ten lepers, and one of them had glorified God there∣for, the Pharisees demanded of him, when the kingdom of God should come? He answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation. Neither shall they say, Lo here, or lo there; for behold, the kingdom of God is with∣in you.</P>
<P>The Son of God was born <HI>within</HI> that church, of the seed of David, in the town of Bethlehem, according to the prophecy which says, <HI>This man shall be the peace.</HI> Micah v. 1—5. And when he entered upon his public ministry, and appeared in Galilee, the people who sat in darkness, <HI>saw great light.</HI> Isaiah ix. 1—6. Mat. iv. 14—16. Yet many in our day have imagined, that our text proves, that there is a <HI>light within every man,</HI> su∣perior to the holy scriptures. In the year 1773, a paper was printed at Providence, and also at Norwich, which represented the doctrine of God's electing a certain number of the children of men to holiness and eternal happiness, while the rest are left to perish in their sins, to be as cruel as the heathen, "who <HI>sacrificed their sons and daughters unto devils.</HI>" And the paper closed with saying, "Reader, from this, and many other hurtful er∣rors, you would soon be disentangled, could you only shake off the chains of <HI>tradition.</HI> The uni∣versal cry of, <HI>Lo here, or lo there,</HI> in this or that outward communion, would never engage you in any fierce contentions, but rather pass away unno∣ticed by you. And the only possible way, (believe it, or not) to avoid every prevailing error, and of finding every saving truth, is to listen, solemnly, attentively to listen, agreeable to the written word, <HI>to the still small voice within you.</HI>"</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="024061_0006_0FC2FD041117FDE8"/>
This paper was published, and was spread through New-England, by ministers who were sent from Great-Britain, to propagate Episcopacy in our land. And after their nation had <HI>murdered</HI> many thou∣sands, in attempting to bind us in all cases what∣soever, the <HI>voice within them,</HI> constrained them to make peace with America, to avoid ruin to them∣selves. Yet in the close of the war, a book from England was reprinted at Philadelphia, which says, "If God disposeth the state of events in such a manner, that sin will most certainly follow, and that he also permits, or doth not hinder it, he must be the sole <HI>Author</HI> of sin himself, and those who are called the actors, or committers of evil, are only <HI>subjects</HI> by whom he effects it:"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Phipps against Newton, 1783, p. 95.</NOTE> And the author, who gives this assertion, refers us to Bar∣clay, who said, "The kingdom of God cometh not with observation, neither shall they say, <HI>Lo here, or lo there,</HI> for behold the kingdom of God <HI>is with∣in you."</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 205.</NOTE> And says his defender, "The <HI>Quakers</HI> neither read the scriptures, nor any thing else, du∣ring the time of their worship, as a part of it; but after that is over, they usually once in the year, take the opportunity, before the congregation se∣parate, to read those short informations and advices which are transmitted from the yearly-meeting in London. These advices always consist of scrip∣ture-quotations, and doctrines agreeable to scrip∣ture, according to the best of their knowledge; but the reading of them is no more a part of their worship, than the reading testimonies of denial against immoral members, or the substance of briefs recommended by the Crown, at such op∣portunities." <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. 153.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="024061_0007_0FC2FD05797C8998"/>
Thus Episcopalians and Quakers were agreed, in sitting up a rule within themselves above the word of God. Yea, many of them will not allow the holy scriptures to be the word of God. But Jesus said, I am come a <HI>light</HI> into the world, that whosoever believeth on me, should not abide in darkness. And if any man hear my words, and believe not, I judge him not; for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not <HI>my words,</HI> hath one that judgeth him: the <HI>word</HI> that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. John xii. 46—48. His <HI>words</HI> and his <HI>word</HI> are the same, even the will of God revealed by his Spirit. And an inspired apostle says, "We are not as many, who <HI>corrupt the word of God;</HI> but as of <HI>sincerity,</HI> but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.—We have renounced the hidden things of <HI>dishonesty,</HI> not walking in <HI>crastiness,</HI> nor handling <HI>the word of God deceitfully,</HI> but by <HI>manifestation of the truth,</HI> commending ourselves to every man's <HI>conscience</HI> in the sight of God. 2 Cor. ii. 17. iv. 2. The body of Jesus saw no corruption, even when it lay in the tomb; therefore the holy scriptures are the only word of God that men can corrupt; and they do it, by handling the word deceitfully. And were it not for this wickedness, the kingdom of God would be easily understood, and rejoiced in, under every view of it in his word.</P>
<P>In the <HI>first</HI> place, it means the proclamation of the gospel to a sinful world. Therefore the Mes∣senger who came to prepare the way of the Son of God, said to the Jews, Repent ye; for the king∣dom of heaven is at hand. Mat. iii. 2. And after Jesus was baptized, and had endured the tempta∣tions of the devil, he came into Galilee, preaching
<PB N="9" REF="024061_0008_0FC2FD0E1B202B08"/>the gospel of the kingdom of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: Repent ye and believe the gospel. And after his death and resurrection, he appeared unto the <HI>eleven,</HI> and said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be damned. Mark i. 14, 15. xvi. 15, 16. This commission was given to the <HI>eleven,</HI> who were all born again. In the covenant of circumcision, the regenerate and unre∣generate were bound together in a national church. Therefore when Christ sent out the <HI>twelve,</HI> he said, Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not. But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel, and as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at hand. Judas the <HI>traitor</HI> was included in this com∣mission. Mat. x. 1.—7. But after Christ by his death had disannulled the covenant of circum∣cision, he gave the pure gospel commission to none but regenerate persons.</P>
<P>The <HI>second</HI> sense in which the kingdom of God is taken in his word, is the change of heart which is produced thereby. When the Son of God, the great <HI>light of the world,</HI> came to his own people, they received him not. But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believed on his name; who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. And Jesus said, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. John i. 12, 13. iii. 3. But men have been so far from believing him, that they have gen∣erally held to the bringing of persons into the
<PB N="10" REF="024061_0009_0FC2FD0F63B75F20"/>kingdom of God by blood, by their own wills, or by the wills of other men; and from thence have come all national churches. But God says, Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.—Him that is weak in the saith receive you, but not to doubtful disputations.—For the king∣dom of God is not meat and drink, but righteous∣ness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. Rom. x. 17. xiv. 1, 17. But men have commonly re∣ceived persons into the church, without any evi∣dence of their being <HI>in the saith;</HI> and they have pursued all with <HI>doubtful disputations,</HI> who have refused to obey man in the things of God. He requires each one to act saithfully and kindly in every station of life, as they can answer it to their great Judge. And he says, If any man each other∣wise, and consent not to wholsom <HI>words,</HI> even the <HI>words</HI> of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to <HI>godliness;</HI> he is proud, know∣ing nothing, but doting about questions and strises of words, whereof cometh envy, strise, railings, evil surmisings, <HI>perverse disputings</HI> of men of cor∣rupt minds, and destitute of the <HI>truth,</HI> supposing that <HI>gain is godliness:</HI> from such withdraw thyself. Yet, because <HI>godliness</HI> and <HI>bonesty,</HI> are connected with prayer for civil rulers, many have imagined that they ought to support religious teachers by <HI>force.</HI> Whereas this practice came from <HI>seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils.</HI> But <HI>godliness</HI> is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. 1 Tim. ii. 2. iv. 1—8. vi. 1—5. And, to guard against anxiety about food and raiment, our Lord says, Seek first the kingdom of God, and his righ∣teousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. Mat. vi. 33. How much then are all men
<PB N="11" REF="024061_0010_0FC2FD10B88BAD70"/>deceived, who use secular force to support religious teachers? In them the prophecy is fulfilled, which says, All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all the beasts of the forest. His watchmen are blind; they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to slumber. Yea, they are <HI>greedy dogs,</HI> which can <HI>never have enough,</HI> and they are shep∣herds that cannot understand: they all look to their <HI>own way,</HI> every one for his <HI>gain</HI> from his quarter. Isaiah lvi. 9—12. What a hand have such teachers had in all the wars among the nations?</P>
<P>The <HI>third</HI> sense of the kingdom of God, is his government of his visible church. Our Lord said, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now is my kingdom not from hence. Pilate there∣fore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayst that I am a king. To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the <HI>truth.</HI> Every one that is of the <HI>truth,</HI> heareth my voice. John xviii. 36, 37. Fighting with the <HI>sword,</HI> is necessary in the government of this world; and subjection thereto ought to be a matter of <HI>conscience</HI> with every soul. Rom. xiii. 1—5. But the gov∣ernment of the church should be as distinct from all worldly states, as the power of <HI>truth</HI> on the mind, is from the <HI>sword</HI> on the body. For Jesus said to the <HI>eleven,</HI> All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth: Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all things, whatsoever I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you
<PB N="12" REF="024061_0011_0FC2FD1A7011E498"/>alway even unto the end of the world. Amen. Mat. xxviii. 16—20. It was before observed, that this commission was given to the <HI>eleven,</HI> without any <HI>traitor</HI> among them. But God says, In the last days perilous times shall come; for men shall be lovers of their ownselves, covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, <HI>traitors,</HI> heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 2 Tim. iii. 1—5. Language cannot describe our times more exactly, than was thus done by inspiration above seventeen hundred years ago. And a great means of these evils, hath been the use of the sword in religious affairs, con∣trary to the command of Christ, who says,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit, then appeared the tares also. So the servants of the housholder came and said unto him, Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it tares? He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of har∣vest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them; but gather the wheat into my barn.—He that soweth the good seed is the Son of man: the
<PB N="13" REF="024061_0012_0FC2FD1BF46A59A8"/>field is the world: the good seed are the children of the kingdom: but the tares are the children of the wicked one: the enemy that sowed them, is the devil; the harvest is the end of the world, and the reapers are the angels. Mat. xiii. 24—30, 37—39. Accordingly he said unto hypocrites in the Jewish church, Ye are of your father the <HI>devil,</HI> and the lusts of your father ye will do: he was a <HI>murderer</HI> from the beginning, and abode not <HI>in the truth,</HI> because there is no <HI>truth</HI> in him. When he speaketh a <HI>lie,</HI> he speaketh of his own; for he is a <HI>liar,</HI> and the <HI>father of it.</HI> John viii. 44. And it is impossible for the servants of Christ to root up all hypocrites out of the world, without destroying the saints with them. Yea, and the use of the sword in religious affairs; arms the enemies of God against his children, as the experience of all ages hath demonstrated. But,</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> the kingdom of God, means his coming in the last day, to judge the world in righteous∣ness; when the wicked shall go away into ever∣lasting punishment, and the righteous be received into life eternal. Therefore Jesus says unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life, shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it. For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father, with his angels; and then shall he reward every man according to his works. Mat. xvi. 24—27. Ve∣rily verily I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live. For
<PB N="14" REF="024061_0013_0FC2FD296236E940"/>as the Father hath life in himself, so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself; and hath given him authority to execute judgment also, because he is the Son of man. Marvel not at this; for the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth, they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the res∣urrection of damnation. John v. 25—29.</P>
<P>And these five senses are perfectly harmonious. For the proclamation of the gospel, believed with the heart, and obeyed in the church, without in∣juring any man in the world, as each one can an∣swer it to God in the last day, is a glorious kingdom which cannot be moved. And if the church of Christ was governed wholly by his laws, enforced in his name, she would be an infinite blessing to human society. For justice, mercy, and faithful∣ness, are the effence of all the revealed will of God. And he said of Abraham, I know him, that he will command his children and his houshold after him, and they shall keep the way of the Lord, to do justice and judgment; that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him. Gen. xviii. 19. Justice and judgment, is the only way to enjoy the promised mercy of God to sinful men. Only a <HI>remnant</HI> of the children of Israel, were saved by the Son of God, whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting. And when they enquired about the way of acceptance with him, he said, He hath shewed thee, O man, what is <HI>good;</HI> and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God? Micah v. 1—5. vi. 8. And when one said to Jesus, <HI>Good</HI> master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?
<PB N="15" REF="024061_0014_0FC2FD2AA8FB9F78"/>Jesus said, Why callest thou me good? there is none good but one, that is <HI>God.</HI> And when he parted with Jesus, rather than to part with his riches, in acts of mercy, Jesus said, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God. When the disciples heard it, they were exceeding∣ly amazed, saying, Who then can be saved? But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible, but with God all things are pos∣sible. Mat. xix. 16—26.</P>
<P>It is impossible with men, to convince any soul that Jesus is truly <HI>God,</HI> and that all <HI>good,</HI> for time and eternity, is only to be enjoyed by saith in his <HI>perfect righteousness,</HI> and obedience to his <HI>holy word.</HI> But the Spirit of God convinced three thousand souls hereof in <HI>one day;</HI> and to them it was said, The <HI>promise</HI> is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, <HI>even as many as the Lord our God shall call.—Then they that gladly received his word, were baptized.</HI> Acts ii. 37—41. Christ hath redeemed us from the <HI>curse</HI> of the law, being made a <HI>curse</HI> for us—that the <HI>blessing</HI> of Abraham might come on the Gentiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the <HI>promise of the Spirit through faith.</HI> And they who think to receive it in any other way, are <HI>bewitched.</HI> Gal. iii. 1—14. For by thy <HI>sorceries</HI> were all nations <HI>deceived.</HI> Rev. xviii. 23. If men were not <HI>deceived,</HI> they would never claim the promises of God, in a way of dis∣obedience to his precepts. And as the church is presented as a <HI>chaste virgin to Christ,</HI> it is impossi∣ble for any men to have a <HI>commanding</HI> power there∣in. But all <HI>deceitful teachers,</HI> are <HI>ministers of the devil.</HI> And Paul appealed to the church of Co∣rinth against such, and said, In the mouth of two
<PB N="16" REF="024061_0015_0FC2FD2BB76BAAF8"/>or three witnesses shall every word be established. 2 Cor. xi. 2—15. xiii. 1. Exactly according to the law of Christ, who says to his church, What∣soever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. Mat. xviii. 15—18.</P>
<P>But this government of his <HI>holy city,</HI> hath been trodden under foot, ever since the <HI>beast</HI> arose out of the bottomless pit, who received his power from the <HI>devil.</HI> Rev. xi. 2—10. xiii. 1—8. <HI>Force and cruelty,</HI> is the way of the <HI>beasts,</HI> from whom our spiritual <HI>David</HI> will deliver his flock. Ezek. xxxiv. 4—25. Protestants have exercised all the power of the first beast at Rome, and have carried blood and slavery around the world, in galleys and gallant ships. But the church of Christ will yet be a quiet habitation; For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our lawgiver, the Lord is our king, he will save us. And he says to Babylon, Thy <HI>merchants</HI> with whom thou hast laboured from thy youth, shall wander every one to his quarter; none shall save thee. Isaiah xxxiii. 20—22. xlvii. 10—15. Rev. xviii. 23. The reason why piety, religion, and mo∣rality, are essentially necessary for the good order of human society, is because they are as much above the <HI>commanding</HI> power of man, as the showers and shines of heaven are. Therefore Moses says, My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon the grass. Because I will publish the name of the Lord: ascribe ye greatness unto our God. He is the Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth, and without iniquity, just and right is he.—But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked—then he forsook God which made him, and lightly
<PB N="17" REF="024061_0016_0FC2FD2DE6A566F0"/>esteemed the Rock of his salvation.—To me be∣longeth vengeance and recompense; their foot shall slide in due time. Deut. xxxii. 2—4, 15, 35. From whence an inspired apostle says, Dearly be∣loved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath; for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not overcome of evil, but over∣come evil with good. Rom. xii. 19—21. Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without waver∣ing; (for he is faithful that promised) and let us consider one another, to provoke unto love, and to good works; not forsaking the assembling of our∣selves together, as the manner of some is; but ex∣horting one another, and so much the more as ye see the day approaching. For if we sin <HI>wilfully,</HI> after that we have received the knowledge of the <HI>truth,</HI> there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversa∣ries. He that despised Moses law died without mercy, under two or three witnesses: of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done <HI>despite unto the Spirit of grace?</HI> For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. Heb. x. 23—30.</P>
<P>The body of the Son of God never was trodden under foot; but his holy laws have been, and his blood hath been counted an unholy thing, and great despite hath been done to the Spirit of grace.
<PB N="18" REF="024061_0017_0FC2FD3872668EB0"/>The devils believe that there is one God; and they tremble before the Son of God. And all men who profess faith in Christ, and do not obey his laws, have only a dead faith. For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without works is dead also. James ii. 19—26. From whence I conclude, that the killing of God's two witnesses, is triumph∣ing over the revealed will of God, which used to torment the consciences of men. Rev. xi. 9, 10. But God says, Behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly shall be stubble, and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name, shall the SUN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth and grow up as calves of the stall. And ye shall tread down the wicked, for they shall be ashes under the soles of your feet, in the day that I shall do this, saith the Lord of hosts. Mal. iv. 1—3. And an inspired apostle says, We, according to his promise, look for new heavens, and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righ∣teousness. 2 Peter iii. 13. All which proves that piety, religion, and morality, are as much above the commanding power of men, as the showers of heaven are, or the sun in the firmament.</P>
<P>Faith in Jesus Christ, and obedience to the re∣vealed will of God, INDEPENDENT of the world, is the only way to escape <HI>everlasting burnings.</HI> For he says, He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly, he that despiseth the gain of oppres∣sions, that shaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil; he shall dwell on high, his place of defence shall be
<PB N="19" REF="024061_0018_0FC2FD39E9D30800"/>the munition of rocks, bread shall be given him, his waters shall be sure. Thine eyes shall see the King in his beauty; they shall behold the land that is very far off. Isaiah xxxiii. 13—17. But the general cry of the world is, Cast in thy lot among us, let us all have one purse.—Their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood. Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird. And they lay wait for their own blood, they lurk privily for their own lives. So are the ways of every one that is <HI>greedy of gain;</HI> which taketh away the life of the owners thereof. Prov. i. 14—19. Which passage is expressly applied to <HI>all the world.</HI> Rom. iii. 15—19. And what a <HI>net</HI> did Great-Britain lay for their own <HI>feet,</HI> when they were lately so <HI>greedy of gain!</HI> Yea, how many <HI>lives</HI> did their <HI>bribery</HI> take away! For their national debt <HI>bribed</HI> all parts of the kingdom, to pursue their was against America to the last extremity. And the same <HI>merchandise</HI> is now carried on in our land; for our public securities are daily bought and sold <HI>deceit∣fully,</HI> so <HI>that truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot enter.</HI> But the eternal Father says to his Son, My <HI>Spirit</HI> that is upon thee, and my <HI>words</HI> which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seeds seed, saith the Lord, from henceforth and forever. Isaiah lix. 14, 20, 21. And this is the only way for any to be <HI>ingrafted</HI> into the church of Christ, which is <HI>life from the dead.</HI> Rom. xi. 15—27. For he says, It is the <HI>Spirit</HI> that quickneth, the <HI>flesh</HI> profiteth nothing; the <HI>words</HI> that I speak unto you, they are <HI>spirit,</HI> and they are <HI>life.</HI> John vi. 63. Where∣fore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of naugh∣tiness, and receive with meekness the <HI>ingrafted
<PB N="20" REF="024061_0019_0FC2FD3B6D090D80"/>word,</HI> which is able to save your souls. James i. 21. Being <HI>born again,</HI> not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible, by the <HI>word of God</HI> which liveth and abideth forever.—Ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar peo∣ple; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his mar∣vellous light. 1 Peter i. 23. ii. 9.</P>
<P>These are the only <HI>priesthood,</HI> and <HI>holy nation,</HI> that God hath under heaven. And to them he says, Submit yourselves to every <HI>ordinance of man</HI> for the Lord's sake. 1 Peter ii. 13. While he also says to them, Beware left any man spoil you through <HI>philosophy and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ. —After the commandments and doctrines of men, which things have indeed a shew of wisdom in willworship and humility, and neglecting of the body, not in any honor to the satisfying of the flesh.</HI> Col. viii. 22, 23. Yet after the apostolic age, philosophy and vain deceit, spoiled the church in such a manner, as to call her officers the <HI>priesthood,</HI> in distinction from the brethren; and they pretended to make child∣ren <HI>holy,</HI> without their own knowledge or choice. And this <HI>willworship</HI> hath been handed down by <HI>tradition</HI> through the church of Rome, who is the <HI>mother of harlots,</HI> and full of <HI>robbery</HI> and <HI>murder.</HI> The national church of Israel <HI>robbed God,</HI> when they neglected to communicate the tithes and of∣ferings which he required of them. Mal. iii. 8. But when she said, I will go after <HI>my lovers,</HI> that gave me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink, <HI>she played the harlot.</HI> And God said of her officers, As <HI>troops of robbers</HI> wait for a man, so the company of <HI>priests murder</HI> in the way by consent; for they commit
<PB N="21" REF="024061_0020_0FC2FD3CE7D02B50"/><HI>lewdness.</HI> Hosea ii. 5. vi. 9. The <HI>heads</HI> thereof judge for reward, and the <HI>priests</HI> thereof teach for hire, and the <HI>prophets</HI> thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon the Lord, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. Micah iii. 11. Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the Lord hath spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they have <HI>rebelled</HI> against me.—When ye come to appear before me, who hath <HI>required</HI> this at your hand to tread my courts?—Your hands are full of <HI>blood.</HI> Isaiah i. 2, 12, 15. And he says to the Christian church, The prophecy came not in old time by the will of man; but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost. But there were false <HI>prophets</HI> also among the people, even as there shall be false <HI>teachers</HI> among you, who privily shall bring in damnable <HI>heresies,</HI> even denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themselves swist destruction. And many shall follow their per∣nicious ways, by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. And through <HI>covetous∣ness,</HI> shall they with feigned words make <HI>merchan∣dise of you:</HI> whose judgment now of a long time lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not. 2 Peter i. 21. ii. 1—3.</P>
<P><HI>Rebellion,</HI> in the old testament, and <HI>heresy,</HI> un∣der the gospel, evidently mean the same thing. Therefore when Christ had disannulled the cove∣nant of circumcision, and had established the new covenant with his church, the Jews called it <HI>se∣dition,</HI> a <HI>sect,</HI> and <HI>heresy.</HI> Acts xxiv. 5, 14. And <HI>divisions, seditions,</HI> and <HI>heresies,</HI> are works of the <HI>flesh.</HI> But the fruit of the <HI>Spirit</HI> is love, joy, peace, long suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meek∣ness, temperance: against such there is no law.
<PB N="22" REF="024061_0021_0FC2FD4661F0DBA8"/>And they that are Christ's have <HI>crucified the flesh,</HI> with the affections and lusts. 1 Cor. xi. 18, 19. Gal. v. 20—24. And God says, A man that is an <HI>heretick,</HI> after the first and second admonition, re∣ject; knowing that he that is such, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned of himself. Titus iii. 10, 11. Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the prophets. And men who assume the place of judges of others, while they disregard this rule of equity themselves, are <HI>hypocrites, dogs, swine,</HI> and <HI>wolves.</HI> Mat. vii. 5 6, 12, 15. They <HI>despise government,</HI> and are <HI>self-willed,</HI> under the name of liberty. The <HI>dog</HI> is turned to his own vomit again; and the <HI>sow</HI> that was washed, to her wallowing in the mire. 2 Peter ii. 10, 19, 22.</P>
<P>Known laws, well executed, within certain lim∣its, is the essence of all government among man∣kind. And the laws of Christ, executed by his church, where all are to act as little children, is his plan of government therein. And he says, Who∣soever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a <HI>little child,</HI> he shall not enter therein.—The <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> exercise <HI>lordship</HI> over them—but so shall it not be among you. Mark x. 15, 42, 43. The <HI>Gentiles</HI> shall tread the <HI>holy city</HI> under foot forty and two months.—Power shall be given unto the <HI>beast</HI> to continue forty and two months. Rev. xi. 2. xiii. 5. But God says to his children, Ye know that no whore-monger, nor unclean person, nor <HI>covetous man who is an idolater,</HI> hath any inherit∣ance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God. Let no man deceive you with vain words; for because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Be not ye therefore
<PB N="23" REF="024061_0022_0FC2FD476FFB7668"/>partakers with them. Eph. v. 5—7. Come out from among them, and be ye <HI>separate,</HI> saith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. 2 Cor. vi. 14—18. He com∣pares deceitful teachers and professors, to the in∣habitants of Sodom and Gomorrah, who are suf∣fering the vengeance of eternal fire. Deut. xxxii. 31.—34. Isaiah i. 9—15. Jer. xxiii. 14. Ezek. xvi. 46—50. Jude 7, 8. And men who sin against the light of the gospel are worse than Sodom. Mat. x. 15. xi. 24. Luke x. 12. And they who have <HI>a form of godliness,</HI> while they <HI>resist the truth,</HI> are like the magicians of Egypt. 2 Tim. iii. 1—8. And the great city, in the street of which the two witnesses will lie dead, three days and an half, is <HI>spiritually</HI> called Sodom and Egypt, where also our Lord was crucified. Rev. xi. 7—10. He was crucified by <HI>hypocrites</HI> and <HI>infidels;</HI> and how do such now hold his church in bondage? They re∣fuse to allow her to serve God according to his re∣vealed will, without injuring any man in the world. And a church of Christ, governed wholly by his laws, is not esteemed a corporation strong enough to secure worldly property that is <HI>consecrated</HI> to re∣ligious uses. Many BANKS are formed for the pur∣pose of earthly gain, while few give their services and money into the Lord's BANK. Yet he says, Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom. Sell that ye have, and give alms: provide yourselves bags which wax not old, a treasure in the heavens that faileth not, where no thief approacheth, neither moth cor∣rupteth. For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.—Make to yourselves friends of
