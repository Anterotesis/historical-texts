<Q><BIBL><HI>Gen. 24.49.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my Master, tell me: And if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right Hand, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Left.</P></Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">C</SEG>Hristian Friends and dear Bre∣thren, my Errand to you this Day from the great God the Father of Jesus, resembles that of <HI>Eliezer</HI> of <HI>Damascus, A∣brabam's</HI> Servant, who was sent to wooe a Wife for his Masters Son: Brethren I come a wooing in the Name and Behalf of Christ my great Master the Kings Son.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="003965_0004_10031985EDE40818"/>
My Business with you to day is to per∣swade you to be speedily and sincerely espou∣sed to the Lamb of God, the Lord Jesus Christ. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> That I mayn't miss my Errand, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of desir'd Success. What <HI>Abraham's</HI> Servant proposed by Way of cau∣tious Supposition, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>peradventure the Woman would not be willing to follow him,</HI> vers. 5. I have Reason to use as Matter of doleful Complaint and bitter Lamentation over many of you, whom former Attempts have fail'd to perswade to this Marriage, and also as an Excitement to awful fear and passio∣nate concerns now.</P>
<P><HI>Abraham's</HI> Servant was engag'd or bound by Oath to be <HI>faithful in the Business he was sent about,</HI> vers. 9. And you know Bre∣thren, I am under a solemn Ordination Oath, to be faithful to God and you; this I hope will excuse for my endeavour to deal with you in good earnest.</P>
<P>Again in the Context you may observe, that if the Servant used faithful Endeavours, <HI>and the Woman would not be perswaded then he was to be clear from his Oath:</HI> So, Friends, if after all the endeavours I can use to per∣swade and reclaim you, ye stil continue ob∣stinate, I shall be free from the Oath I have taken, and from your Blood.</P>
<P><HI>Abraham's</HI> Servant had good Success, the God of his Master prosper'd his Way; <HI>Re∣beca,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="003965_0005_1003198D92CA2288"/>readily consented and said <HI>I will go,</HI> vers. 58. O that there may be found here some <HI>Rebeca, Lydia,</HI> or <HI>Zacheus,</HI> who is wil∣ling to consent to Day to a Marriage with the Lord Jesus.</P>
<P><Q><HI>Isaac</HI> being a Type of Christ, some In∣terpreters make this fetching of a Wife for him, to signify the Espousing of the Church to Christ, by the Agency of his Servants, the Ministers, hence the Church is called the Bride, the Lambs Wife, Christ the Brid∣groom, <HI>Job.</HI> 3.29. Whose great Business, it is to perswade poor Souls to consent to embrace him as their Lord and Husband, in an everlasting Marriage Covenant, its hardly credible that this Story would have been Resolved in so minute Circum∣stances, had not a nobler and more myste∣rious Marriage been design'd to be represen∣ted by it.</Q></P>
<P>Under this view the Text presents to our Considerations, the 2. Propositions, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>That the Ministers of Christ are Spokes∣men for the Marriage of their Masters Son,</HI> —and.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>That they are griev'd to see their Mas∣ter's Marriage hang in Suspence.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I return to consider the first <HI>Propos.</HI> In Explaining of which, I shall endeavour to shew the Analogy between a Spokesman in a temporal Marriage, and a Ministers Proper∣ty's
<PB N="7" REF="003965_0006_1003198F14B42BC0"/>and practice in negotiating a spiritual Marriage, between Christ and Souls, and so improve it; the Analogy, I think, consists principally in the following Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. A Spokesman should be skillful, able with apt Expressions to set forth the Lovers Excellencies; so a Minister should be no No∣vice, but like <HI>Apollos, Mighty in the Scrip∣tures,</HI> and thereby able in some Measure to speak forth his Redeemers Praise.</P>
<P N="2">2. Acquainted with his Person; for how can they commend him whom they do not know: So should Ministers know Christ and the Truth as it is in him; otherwise they speake but faintly for him. <HI>The Secrets of the Lord are with those that fear him, and he will remember his holy Covenant.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. True to his interest, a Spokesman should be a familiar Friend of the Lover, and faith∣ful to his Cause; <HI>Abraham's</HI> Servant was such whom he appointed to get a Wife for his Son: And so must the Ministers of Christ be, <HI>Joh.</HI> 15.14.15. 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.12. <HI>And I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, for that he counted me faithful putting me into the Mini∣stry.</HI> Jer. 23.31. <HI>I am against these Prophets, that smooth their Tongues,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Poli Synopsin in Locum.</NOTE> So the English Annotations and other learned Interpreters <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Henery in Locum.</NOTE> render the Word <HI>USE</HI> as our Version hath it.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="8" REF="003965_0007_10031990DC57A550"/>
4. A Spokesman useth a Variety of Ar∣guments, to alure the Love of the Person he treats with to his Master, drawn from his per∣sonal Merit and great Affluence: So the faithful Ministers of Christ Labour to win the Affections of undone Sinners to him, by setting forth his Greatness, Goodness, Suita∣bleness, Absolute Necessity, Transcendent Excellency, and inexhaustible All suficiency.</P>
<P N="5">5. A faithful Spokesman is griev'd to see his great Master slighted, and his most preg∣nant Arguments, and his perswasive Adres∣ses fail of desired Success; he can't be con∣tented with telling of his Narrative without seeing it take Effect, this our Text confirms, — So a godly Minister is not satisfy'd with the Performance of Preaching as a Task, and the Observance of Sinners attent upon it, unless he can perceive some Signs of the Ef∣fects of his Preaching, some Signs of Sinners consenting to embrace the Redeemer.</P>
<P N="6">6. A faithful Spokesman will not only Address the Woman to whom he is sent, but also make Application to Heaven, for Direc∣tion and Success, this did <HI>Abraham's</HI> Servant, <HI>vers.</HI> 12. <HI>And he said, O Lord God of my Master</HI> Abraham, <HI>I pray thee send me good Speed this Day, and shew kindness unto my Master</HI> Abraham. So do the Ministers of Christ bow their Knees to the most high God, of whom the whole Family in Heaven and
<PB N="9" REF="003965_0008_10031999671683F8"/>Earth is Named, and vehemently entreat for Guidence and Succe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Permit me, kind Hearers, to supplicate the supreme Majesty, in the Words of <HI>Abrahams</HI> Servant, with some small Variation. O Lord God of my Master Jesus, send me good Speed this Day, and shew Kindness unto my Master; in causing some poor Sinners consent to a Marriage with him.</P>
<P N="7">7. A Faithful Servant, if he succeeds in his Negotiation, returns the due Honours of his successes to God, so did <HI>Eliezer,</HI> vers. 27. <HI>And He said, blessed be the Lord God of my Master</HI> Abraham, <HI>who hath not left destitute my Master of his Mercy and of his Truth:</HI> So the Heart of a faithfull Minister, when he sees poor Sinners return to their offended Sovereign, and Kiss the Son with the deepest Homage, Affection and Obedience, beats in his Bosom with joyfull Transports and grate∣full Emotions of undissembled praise to God, God and the Lamb that fits upon the Throne.</P>
<P N="8">8. The Spokesman of a Prince or great Man, offers Bracelets or some rich Love to∣kens to the Person his Master makes his Court to, in Order to demonstrate his Masters Greatness and Love, and to gain the Womans consent, <HI>vers. 22. So the Ministers of Christ offer in their Masters Name, the Sealings of the Spirit, the Jewels of the Covenant, to such
<PB N="10" REF="003965_0009_1003081E9100F760"/>who will consent to the Marriage of the King's Son.</HI> But</P>
<P N="9">9. When he can't prevail, he returns to his Master, and gives him an Account of his Treatment; this a pious Writer takes to be the Scope and Drift of our Text. So the poor Ministers of Christ, when you will not hear their wooings, but slight their Lord and all the Offeres of his Love, are obliged with sor∣rowful Hearts and weeping Eyes to complain to their Master, now, of your doleful Stu∣pidity and cruel Obstinacy, and must in the great Day, unless ye repent, Witness against you, the Offers of Life they have made to you, the Arguments they have us'd with you to Embrace them, and your obstinacy against both. — But I proceed to the Improve∣ment in a 4 fold Use of Information, Exa∣mination, Conviction, and Exhortation. — — and,</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Does the eternal Son of God offer him∣self in Marriage to poor undone Sinners. O surprizing Condescension! O stupendious, <HI>Stoop</HI> of Humble Majesty and amazing Mer∣cy! O the Breadth, the Length, the Depth of the Love of Christ which passeth Know∣ledge! Admire all ye Host of Heaven and Earth at this!</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. How great is the Ingratitude, how un∣accountable the Folly, and destructive the Madness of these who will not be charm'd
<PB N="11" REF="003965_0010_1003199D994256D0"/>and alur'd by such Love to consent to a Mar∣riage Covenant with the God of Glory. What will such be able to plead in their own Vindication at the Redeemer's Bar? Won't Confusion cover them as a Garment, and si∣lence seal their guilty Lips? <HI>For how shall we escape if we neglect so great a Salvation.</HI> Heb. 2.3, <HI>If he that despised</HI> Moses's <HI>Law, died without mercy, under two or three Wit∣nesses: Of how much sorer Punishment, sup∣pose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath troden under Foot the Son of God,</HI> Heb. 10.28.29.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>But I hasten to the</P>
<P N="2">2. Use which is of Examination. Sinner, it's of the last Necessity, both in Regard of the regular Performance of Duty, and the Re∣ception of reasonable Comfort in this World, and thy eternal Safety in the next, that thou be acquainted with thy present State, and know whither thou be espoused to Christ or not. One Messenger after another has been sent to treat with you, about a Marriage to the Re∣deemer, and now I ask you in the Name of the Eternal God, my Lord and Master, have you been perswaded to consent to the Terms of this Marriage Covenant? Yea or Not. How stands the Cause, poor Sinner, between the great God and thee. to help thee to the Know∣ledge of this, I shall propose some few exa∣minatory Signs, by which I earnestly request
<PB N="12" REF="003965_0011_100319A074992620"/>you to try your selves <HI>impartialy,</HI> without previous byass, <HI>speedily</HI> without delay, <HI>tho∣roughly</HI> and <HI>conclusively</HI> without further sus∣pence, and <HI>solemnly</HI> as in the presence of the just Judge of Heaven, and Earth.</P>
<P N="1">1. Have you ever been made feelingly Sen∣sible of your Distance from Christ, of the ab∣solute Need of Union to and Communion with him, and of your unworthiness of and inabi∣lity to attain this great Benefit? <HI>Luk.</HI> 15.17. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.3. <HI>Joh.</HI> 15.5.</P>
<P N="2">2. Have you been divorc'd from Sin in the Course of your Disposition and Action? For you may as easily unite Heaven and Hell, Light and Darkness, as Christ and Sin (ha∣bitually) governing or indulg'd in one Soul. 1. Joh. 3.8. <HI>He that committeth Sin, is of the Devil.</HI> 1. Joh. 5.18. <HI>We know that who∣soever is born of God, Sinneth not.</HI> 2. Cor. 6.15. <HI>And what concord hath Christ with</HI> Belial?</P>
<P N="3">3. Have you consented to the Terms of the Covenant of Marriage, <HI>viz. These of Self-denyal, and taking up the Cross?</HI> Luk. 9.23. Is your consent free, full, &amp; habitual? <HI>Ps.</HI> 110 3. <HI>Philip.</HI> 3.8. <HI>Ps.</HI> 119.112.</P>
<P N="4">4. Have you had Communion with Christ by his Word and Spirit? This is a Natural and nesscesary Consequence of a vital Union, can you say with the Apostle, 1. <HI>John,</HI> 1.3. <HI>And truly our Fellowship is with the Fa∣ther,
<PB N="13" REF="003965_0012_100319A221F02028"/>and with his Son Jesus Christ?</HI> Know ye what it is by Experience to have the Kis∣ses of the King, his Love spread abroad in your Hearts, so that you could say with the Spouse, my beloved is mine, and I am his, he feedeth among the Lilies? Know ye by Experience what it is to be <HI>Seal'd hy the Spirit and to cry Abba Father, to have the new Name, the white Stone, and to eat the bidden Mannah?</HI> Cant. 1.2. &amp; 2.16. Ephes. 1.13. Rom. 8.15. Rev. 2.17. Rom. 5.1.—5.</P>
<P N="5">5. Do you conscientiously Labour through the Conrse of your Conversation, to be con∣form'd to the Law, the Love, and the Life of Jesus? 1. <HI>Job.</HI> 1.6. <HI>If we say we have fel∣lowship with him, and walk in Darkness,</HI> (i. e. Go on in a Course of Wickedness, which is fitly compared to Darkness, because it springs from the Darkness of the Understanding, seeks the Darkness of Concealment, tends to and often issues in the Darkness of Damnation) we lye and do not the Truth.</P>
<P>I proceed to the 3d, Use, <HI>viz.</HI> Of Convic∣tion. Alas what Reason is there to fear that many of you are Strangers to these Experien∣ces and posess'd of the very contrary Dispo∣sitions. — for</P>
<P N="1">1. Are there not some of you who always imagin'd you had an interest in Christ, and never have been distress'd with a sorrowful,
<PB N="14" REF="003965_0013_100319AA5D175F58"/>Sense of your being wholly without him, and have never had any more then a Speculative and Historical Knowledge of the Necessity of an Interest in him? And are there not some who are so far from a just Sense of their un∣worthiness of, and Inability to attain this; that the cry up the free will of Man, and think to make up the Breach, between God and themselves, by their duty's, at least in Part? Hence they are easie, when they Pray with some Affection, and take more Care to avoid in their after Practice those Sins which caused their Uneasiness, and then imagine the Matter is adjusted, the Debate ended, the Storm over. Ah, poor deceived Souls? Ye are they who seek Justification, by the Works of the Law! But, pray, remember and consider, that all such are <HI>under the Curse: Gal.</HI> 3.10. <HI>And that</HI> Israel, <HI>who sought after Righteousness this Way, did not attain it, but were found Fighters, against God.</HI> Rom. 9.30. — 32. <HI>&amp; Rom.</HI> 10.3.</P>
<P N="2">2. Are not some of you so far from being divorc'd from Sin, in Disposition and Action, that you cleave the Father to it in Heart and Practise, justify and extenuate your Wicked∣ness as much as you can, glory in your shame, and scoff at strict Holiness, make Pro∣vision for the Flesh. — Or pursue the World with greater Eagerness and Inordinacy then before? Are there not many of you in
<PB N="15" REF="003965_0014_100319ABE753E2E8"/>whom some worldly, fleshly, or ambitious lust habitually governs? Does not this prove to your Faces, that you are dead Men, rather espoused to Satan then to Jesus? <HI>Joh.</HI> 8.44. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.16. <HI>Pro.</HI> 28.13. <HI>Philip.</HI> 3.18. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.6. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.15.</P>
<P N="3">3. Are there not some who are so far from consenting to the Terms of Marriage, <HI>viz.</HI> Self-denyal and taking up the Cross, That they grumble and mutter Reproach privately, or belch out Blasphemy openly, against strict Religion, and will have the Way to Heaven, broad and wide? And therefore that the Wis∣dom of the Father and Fountain of Truth, was mistaken forfooth, when he asserted the contrary! <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.24. And instead of de∣nying themselves, and taking up the |Cross, lay the Reins upon the Necks of their Lusts, and contrive a Cross for others, while in the mean Time, they stoutly contend, that it is only the Weakness of Christians that brings a Cross upon them, which they say might be prevented by prudence and moderation. As if the ancient Prophets, Christ and his Apos∣tles had all miss'd the Matter, both in Doc∣trine and Practice, till these worldly wise Men came upon the Stage, to set Things to rights! Our dear Lords informed his Desci∣ples, that he came not to send Peace on Earth, but a Sword; to set at variance a Man against his Father, and the Daughter
<PB N="16" REF="003965_0015_100319B592A521E0"/>against her Mother, and the Daughter in Law, against her Mother in Law. And that a Man's Foes should be those of his own House∣hold. <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.34, — 36. <HI>He also told them, that the World would hate them because they were not of the World; but chosen out of it. Joh.</HI> 15.19. <HI>Mark.</HI> 13.13. No, no, say these Men, it's because of their imprudencies they are hated. <HI>Note,</HI> by the Way, that I don't pretend to justify any real impruden∣cies in any, but only endeavour to Demon∣strate, that the Enmity of the Wicked against the Godly springs from another Source. The inspired Apostle testifies of <HI>Cain, that he hated his Brother, because his own Works were Evil and his Brother's Righteous.</HI> 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.12. But, I uppose, if <HI>Cain</HI> had been to plead his own Cause, or these Men to com∣mense his Attornies, he and they would have told another Sory, <HI>viz.</HI> That it was for this or that Fault he hated him. The Apos∣tle <HI>Paul</HI> afferts, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.12. <HI>That all who will live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer Persecution.</HI> Yes, say these prudent Men, it was so in the Apostles Times, when the World was almost Pagan, but that Passage is not aplicable to these Christian Times. In Answer to which, I shall only propose a few Questions, to these moderate Men.</P>
<P>Quest. 1. <HI>Is the Devil turned Christian, in reality, these gospel Times?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003965_0016_100319B896E3E0E8"/>
Quest. 2. <HI>Is the Nature of Man different from what it was</HI> 1700 <HI>Years ago?</HI></P>
<P>Quest. 3. <HI>Are the Terms of Christianity alter'd from what they were in the Time of Christ and his Apostles?</HI> If so, then a smooth Scene opens, then these Men have found out a New and easie Way to Heaven; but they must shew their Authority before we believe them, their great Names, blustering Figures, and bold saysoes will hardly gain our impli∣cit assent, or gull us out of our Senses, tho' they were as much renown'd for Piety and Learning as the old Pharisees their Predeces∣sors. Again are there not many whose con∣sent, to the Terms of Marriage is but constrai∣ned through a Pang of legal Distress; par∣tial, attended with Exceptions against this or that Duty, or Dificulty, which pinches upon their worldly Credit, carnal Ease, or temporal Interest; transient, only for a sudden fitt or good mood and away, but donot run through the Vein of their Dispositions and series of their Practice What can be said of these, but that they are wretched Hypocrites, not∣withstanding their Pretenses? 2. <HI>Kings.</HI> 5.18. 1. <HI>Sam.</HI> 15.9.14. <HI>Hos.</HI> 6.4.</P>
<P N="4">4. Are not some so far from Communion with God, that they rave out against the Mentioning of any such Thing, as mere Cant, Enthusiasm, or the Dreams of a delu∣ded Fancy, disorder'd Brain, overheated Ima∣gination,
<PB N="18" REF="003965_0017_100319BB4FE58CB0"/>or melancholy Constitution? To whom we may justly apply the Words of the Apostle <HI>Paul.</HI> 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.14. and <HI>Jud.</HI> 10. Are not many so far from having the Satis∣factory or assuring Experiences of God's Love to their Souls, that they doubt or deny such a Thing to be attainable, tho' the sacred Scriptures plainly assert it in very numerous Places, a few of which I shall mention. 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5.1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.12. <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.17. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8. 38.39. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.2.1. <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.19. <HI>Heb.</HI> 6. 11. <HI>Heb.</HI> 10.22. Is not this a fine Story of these People, that because they have not found these Evidences of the divine Favour, therefore no others have or may! See what horrible arrogance and self-love or rather self∣hatred is in these Men, who make themselves the Measures and Standards of all Mankind! They are, forsooth, the <HI>ne plus ultra,</HI> arrived to the utmost Reach of the human Nature and devine Favour, in Point of Improvement and Experience; O horrible! And this they hold probably with a View to prop up their false Hope. Perhaps, Friend, the Reason why thou dost not know these Tokens of the divine Love in thy Self is, because thou art yet in a State of black Nature and spiritual Death, and then certainly you cannot know what is not; <HI>Nothing,</HI> is not an Object of Knowledge. But is not it uncharitable for you <HI>to Measure every Mans Corn by you own Bushel?</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="19" REF="003965_0018_1003082859056540"/>
5. Are not some of you so far from con∣scientiously labouring through the Course of your Life, to conform to the Law and Life of Jesus; that ye quarrel at the Strictness of the Former, and neglect to Copy after the Later, making Exceptions like <HI>Naman</HI> the Syrian? 2. <HI>King.</HI> 5.18. Do ye not in the Course and general Tenor of your Disposi∣tions and Practice, sin against Conscience by breaking the Law and Counteracting the Life of the Redeemer, and thereby prove that ye have no Marriage Union to or interest in him but on the contrary are under the Curse? <HI>For he that is in Christ has Crucified the Flesh, with the Afections and Lusts of it.</HI> Gal. 5.25. <HI>He that sayeth he abideth in him ought himself so to Walk, even as he Walked.</HI> 1. Joh. 2.6.</P>
<P>But I proceed to the,</P>
<P N="4">4. Use, which is of Exhortation, I beseech you poor unconverted Sinners, that ye would at last be perswaded to accept of Christ as your Lord and King, and abandon other Lords and Lovers, <HI>And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my Master, tell me, and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right Hand or to the Left.</HI> To move you to a Compliance with this Entreaty, I shall propose to your Consideration the following Arguments or Motives; which may the Great and good God, in <HI>whose Hands the Hearts</HI> of all Man∣kind

<P N="2">2. <HI>Proposition, viz. That the faithful Ser∣vants of Christ, are grieved to see the Treaty of their Master's Marriage hang in suspence.</HI> This was the sad source of the pious Prophet's mournful Complaints, <HI>Is.</HI> 49 4. — <HI>I have laboured in vain, I have spent my Strength for nought, Is.</HI> 53.1. <HI>who hath believed our Report?</HI> And <HI>to whom is the Arm of the Lord reveal'd?</HI> Micha. 7.1.2. <HI>Wo is me, for I am as when they have gathered the Summer Fruits, as the Grape gleanings of the Vintage: There is no cluster to Eat. My Soul desired the first ripe Fruit; the good Man is perished out of the Earth, and there is none upright among Men.</HI></P>
<P>Now to hold any Thing in <HI>Suspence,</HI> is to remain undetermined in our Choice concer∣ning it, to <HI>halt between two Opinions,</HI> waver∣ing sometimes to one Object and sometimes to another.</P>
<P>That too many are guilty of this pernicious Practice appears from both Scripture and Reason. 1. <HI>King.</HI> 18.21. <HI>And Elijah came
<PB N="41" REF="003965_0040_10031A05D1BA9300"/>unto all the People, and said, how long halt ye between two Opinions; if the Lord be God, follow him; But if</HI> Baal, <HI>then follow him.</HI> and <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.15, 16. <HI>I know thy Works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my Mouth.</HI> Zec. 1.11. — <HI>And be∣hold all the Earth sitteth still and is at rest.</HI> The stillness of many about the concerns of their Souls, whose lives are notwithstanding very broken and miserable, their indifference about heavenly Things, both in Speech and Practice and in the mean Time their <HI>eager Pursuit</HI> of Earthly, both by unseasonable, yea, everlasting Discourses, about such <HI>Trash,</HI> and by their sinful Contrivances and inordi∣nate Labours to amass great worldly Treasurs, notwithstanding of their contrary Profession, Pretences, Obligations, are too plain Proofs of the Proposition, to be denied by any ra∣tional Man.</P>
<P>The general <HI>Causes</HI> of this <HI>Suspence,</HI> are these following.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Ignorance,</HI> both of the Nature of God, true <HI>Religion,</HI> and their own Danger. If Men had just Apprehensions of the blessed God, and perceived the beautiful attractive Perfections of his Nature, they could not (even the dullest Souls) but be fired and charmed with his ravishing Glories, and freely chuse
<PB N="42" REF="003965_0041_10031A0DD09BF7E8"/>him as their Master and Portion; in like man∣ner, had Men but true Notions, of the Nature, Necessity, and Excellency of Religion, they would doubtless make it the Object of their voluntary Choice and Matter of their perse∣vering Practice, because its Precepts contain such Beauty and Equity in them, its promi∣ses such Springs of Sweetness, and its threats such Majesty and Terror. Were unhappy Sinners but thoroughly shaken off the Lees of their carnal Security and false Hope, and made sensible of their present danger and misery, they would no longer be luke-warm and indifferent, but endeavour <HI>to take Hea∣ven my Storm.</HI> Mat. 11.12. O Sinner, see and consider the danger of ignorance repre∣sente in dreadful Colours in the following Places of Scripture, <HI>Is.</HI> 27.11. — <HI>For it is a People of no Understanding: Therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and, he that formed them will shew them no favour.</HI> 2. Thes. 1.7.8.9. — <HI>When the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels in flaming Fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ: Who shall be punished with everlast∣ing Destruction from the Presence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Love of Sin, this is conatural to us, because we <HI>were shapen in Iniquity. Ps.</HI> 51.5.
<PB N="43" REF="003965_0042_10031A0F533CCE00"/><HI>Job.</HI> 14.4. <HI>Is.</HI> 48.8. <HI>Job.</HI> 11.12. <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.6. Hence we have a strong yea brutish proness naturaly to commit it in despight of Reason, and Conscience. <HI>Jer.</HI> 8.6. <HI>Every one turns to his Course as the Horse rusheth into the Battle.</HI> see <HI>Prov.</HI> 7.22. <HI>Is.</HI> 1.3. This corrupt byass being so inveterate and strong, is there∣fore dificultly broken, and so a powerful pre∣judice against the Sinners compliance with the Terms and Performance of the Duties of Religion.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Policy</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> 2. <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.4. <HI>The God of this World,</HI> (so the Devil is called catchresticaly because of his usurped and ex∣tensive Dominion) <HI>hath blinded the Minds of them which believe not, least the Light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine unto them.</HI> The Devil tells them, that there is no great evil in in small Sins. I mean those that are reckoned such, not that any Sin can be in it self small, no, unless there can be found a small or little Deity. The Sins must needs be great, that are com∣mitted against him. The Devil will listen in to their Ears, that there is no great hurt in ne∣glecting the Hearing of the Word sometimes, and other Duties of Religion, and in taking worldly Discourse on the Lord's Day, and keeping bad Company. As also that there is no such Difficulty in Religion, as some strict Preachers and People profess. Again,
<PB N="44" REF="003965_0043_10031A10DCE385E8"/>that God is merciful▪ and that Christ has died for the worst of Sinners, that it is need∣less for them to take pains about Religion, in their prime and strength (for that he suggests, would be to bid adue to all Pleasures) seeing they can secure their happiness by a late Repentance. Now after Satan has hard∣ned them in Sin after this Manner, if they chance to be awakened by the Word, or Providence, he quickly alters his Note, and tells them that the Day of Grace is over, or that they have committed the unpardonable Sin; their Iniquities are too great to be for∣given, and therefore that its too late to repent. If they had begun sooner in the Service of God, or sinned less against him they might have expected Mercy from him; but now their Sins are so great that they had as good leave of striving, they must perish. To antidote these poisonous destructive Delusions of the Devil. I shall referr you to the following Scriptures, which you may read at your lea∣sure. <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.23. <HI>Rom.</HI> 10.17. <HI>Is.</HI> 58.13. <HI>Pro.</HI> 13.20. <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.24. <HI>Ex.</HI> 34.7. <HI>Joh.</HI> 9.39. <HI>Ecles.</HI> 12.1. <HI>Pro.</HI> 3.17. <HI>Pro.</HI> 1.24.28. <HI>Pro.</HI> 29.1. <HI>Is.</HI> 1.18. <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28. <HI>Mat.</HI> 18.11. <HI>Is.</HI> 42.3. <HI>Ps.</HI> 25.11.</P>
<P N="4">4. The <HI>Cares</HI> of the <HI>World,</HI> either to en∣large (as the Sea) or preserve their Possessi∣ons, choak their good Inclinations, break the Chain of their religious Meditations, and
<PB N="45" REF="003965_0044_10031A151C72AB48"/>make them but luke-warm, Galeos or deceit∣ful Demases in the Affairs of Religion. Alas there be many <HI>Martha's</HI> now adays (but few <HI>Mary's) who are careful and troubled about many Things. Luk.</HI> 10.41. <HI>(Marimnas kai turbadze peri polla.)</HI> But in the mean Time neglect the one Thing necessary, which is infinitly more worth than them all, <HI>viz.</HI> The securing their eternal Happiness in the pro∣per Season of it, the Word <HI>Merimna,</HI> imports such cares as divide and distress the Mind, thus are not the Hearts of many, seperated from God and grievously perplexed with a Variety of vexations Cares about this vain perrishing World, while in the mean there is a deep silence and unconcerndness about their deathless Souls. O Sirs, what will be the End of these Things, see <HI>Amos.</HI> 6.1. and <HI>Zeph:</HI> 1.12. &amp; <HI>Ephes.</HI> 5.5. 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.15.</P>
<P N="5">5. The <HI>Examples</HI> of the <HI>Grafty and Rich,</HI> from which they are apt to inferr this; other People, the wise and great are easie about their Souls, and why may not I? Surely they know more about these Things then I do. <HI>Answ.</HI> Yes, you may, if you'l be: con∣tent with the same Fate <HI>Luk.</HI> 6.25. <HI>Wo unto you that are full: For ye shall hunger. Wo unto you that Laugh now; for ye shall mourn and weep.</HI> See 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.26.27. Not many wise Men after the Flesh, not many noble, are called. But <HI>God has chosen the foo∣lish
<PB N="46" REF="003965_0045_10031A19CDC00500"/>Things, of the World, to confound the wise;</HI> and God hath chosen the weak Things of the World to confound the Things which are Mighty; what if they have a little more Knowledge, their abuse of it makes them but more like the Devil, their Father, who is an inteligent but wicked Spirit.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>Presumption,</HI> either that they are right already, or shall surely be so afterwards, tho' they have no scriptural Ground for either. <HI>Is.</HI> 57.10,</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>Error</HI> in <HI>Opinion</HI> about the <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> or rather the Preparatives of it, <HI>viz.</HI> That there is no necessity of that trouble, and Distress of Soul, which faithful Ministers urge in Order to Conversion, according to the Current of the Scriptures. <HI>Jer.</HI> 4.3. <HI>Joel.</HI> 2.12.13. <HI>Jam.</HI> 4.8.9. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.4. <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.12. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> — But their natural Atheism and Self love, or rather Love of Ease, inclines them secretly to Question or openly to oppose the most plain and clear Testimonies of Scripture in this Case.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Reasons</HI> of Faithful <HI>Minister's</HI> Sor∣rows and grief upon this Account are these, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Because this suspence is dishonourable to their Master, an affront to his Person, it is as if they questioned whether he were pre∣ferable to their Lusts and fading Enjoyments. A Contempt of his Authority, (<HI>Mat.</HI> 6.33.
<PB N="47" REF="003965_0046_10031A1B6D79B170"/><HI>but seek first,</HI> &amp;c.) Armed with the most dreadful Threats. 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 16.22. An abuse of his Mercy adorned with the richest Ten∣ders and Triumphs of free Love. <HI>Joh.</HI> 3.16. Now the greater Affection true hearted Mi∣nisters have to their great Master, in Propor∣tion is their Grief for his abuse, which in∣clines them to Use with sobing Hearts, the passionate Language of <HI>Eliezer,</HI> with their Hearers, <HI>And now if you will deal truly and kindly with my Master tell me, and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right Hand or to the lest.</HI> — And,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Destructive</HI> to <HI>Souls,</HI> Rev. 3.15.16 The greater Value they have for the Souls of Men, the clearer Views they have of the happiness, Sinners slight, and of the compre∣hensive Ruin they are hastning to, by their indifferenc and wickedness, the more in Proportion must be their Sorrows: Who can be an unconcerned Spectator of such a dole∣ful Tragedy? Who can without Indignation and Pitty behold foolish Sinners selling their Souls, for very Trifles of no Moment or Du∣ration, into eternal Pains; ah, its enough to draw pitty from a Rock, and to mak a Heart of Iron bleed. <HI>And now if ye will dral truly with my Master tell me,</HI> —</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Disappointing</HI> to their <HI>Labours,</HI> O! must it not be wounding to their Hearts, to see their Prayers unanswered, their Sermons lost,
<PB N="48" REF="003965_0047_10031A23904F4EE8"/>and all their Desires and Labours blasted with Disappointment? To travel and bring forth nothing but Wind, to Sow upon hard Rocks, or on the faithless Waves, to find by sad Ex∣perience that Sinners will not be perswaded to forsake the Ways of Sin and Death, and ac∣cept the Life set before them! O! how does it grive the poor Ministers of Christ, to see their dear Lord slighted, and all the Offers of his pure and pretious Love despised? While in the mean Time, Sin, Satan and the World findd easie access to the Heart, these base Ri∣vals of our Redeemer, tho' of a viperous brood and destructive tendency, are passionately caressed, readily admitted and their Motions punctually obey'd, while Christ Jesus the Lord of Glory, who has the best Right to our Hearts and Obedience, is basely rejected and kept without the Door of the Heart, <HI>until his Head is wet with the Dew, and his Locks with the Drops of the Night.</HI> Cant. 5.2. How can the faithful Ministers of God, the Sons of <HI>Levi,</HI> and all the Sons of <HI>Zion,</HI> keep from bewailing and sobbing over such infatuated Souls, in the passionate peircing Strains of Mourning <HI>Jeremiah.

1. Is <HI>Suspence</HI> in such important concerns so unreasonable in it self, so grieving to godly Ministers, so offensive to God their great Master, and so distructive to the Souls of Men; Why then, Sinners, in the Name of God, will ye be Guilty of it? <HI>And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my Master, tell me, and if not tell me.</HI> —</P>
<P>But who are Guilty of this perverse Prac∣tice? I <HI>Answer.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. All you <HI>fleshly People,</HI> who <HI>make Provi∣sion for the Flesh, to fulfil the the Lusts thereof. Rom.</HI> 13.14.</P>
<P N="2">2. You <HI>idolotrous Worldlings,</HI> whose cheif Love is set upon this vain.

The Generality of Hypocrites are like <HI>Badgers,</HI> of whom it's said that their Legs are of an unequal Length; so the Dispositions and Practices of Hypocrites are not in the general Course holy and heavenly, but Ambitious, fleshly, or worldly, for all their fair shews, and good Moods.

You <HI>delaying Felixes,</HI> who put of your repentance from Time to Time, in pretence for a convenient Season, which you are never like to get, if you do not improve the pre∣sent; for it will be continually <HI>worse and worse,</HI> with you instead of <HI>better and better,</HI> as you foolishly imagine your; Hearts will gradually grow harder, the Devils Possession of you stronger, your Inclinations to Sin will be greater, and by consequence your Disposition to Piety less, and the great and jealous God its probable will be provoked to forsake and abandon you utterly, because of your obsti∣nate Wickedness. <HI>Ezek.</HI> 24.13. <HI>Rev.</HI> 22.11. <HI>And then wo to thee that ever thou was Born▪</HI> It's you delaying Sinners who hold the Mar∣riage of Jesus in <HI>Suspence;</HI> its you unhappy Souls, who halt between two Opinions, God and Baal, Christ and your Lusts, and thereby
<PB N="56" REF="003965_0055_10031A3BDAD0F998"/>sordidly dishonour the blessed God, grievously Distress the Hearts of his faithful Servants, and cruelly Damn your own Souls, except ye repent speedily, and close with Jesus, to which you are frequently and earnestly invited. <HI>Is.</HI> 55.6.2. <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.20. — <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3.</P>
<P N="10">10. You prophane Herd of hardned Mor∣tals, who have brazen Fronts and Iron Hearts, who dare defy Heaven and storm Hell, you are the Persons also who are Guilty before God, of this halting and suspence; for whatsoever Enmity is in your Wills, or Scoffs on your foul Tongues, against powerful Religion, yet you can not but approve of it secretly in your Judgment, and more sedate Thoughts of Things, and privately Wish sometimes you were possessed of it, only the Difficulties that attend it, especially the Beginnings of it, scare you, cross your carnal ease, and therefore you cannot think with Complacence of an ime∣diate compliance with the Terms of Christia∣nity, but still prorogue this grand Affair of Debate from one Time to another. Hear, poor Sinners, the great Doctor of the Gen∣tiles speaking apositely to your Cafe. <HI>Gal.</HI> 6.7.8. <HI>Be not deceiv'd, God is not mocked, for whatsoever a Man Soweth that shall he also reap, for he that Soweth to the Flesh shall of the Flesh reap Corruption.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="003965_0056_10031A41D3C81A28"/>
And now, Sinners, let me expostulate with you in the Name of the eternal God, <HI>if ye will deal kindly and truly with my Master, tell me, and if not tell me, that I may turn to the right Hand or to the Left.</HI> Why halt ye mise∣rable and infatuated Sinners? Are you in suspence who is the best Master, which is the most rational Work, and which is the best Wages? Is there any Comparison between an usurpin Tyrant, and a rightful amiable Lord? Between the <HI>Beauties of Holiness, and Horrors of Darkness? Infinite Excellency, and the most flagrant Impiety?</HI></P>
<P>Is there any Comparison between real and perpetual Liberty, and the most abject Slave∣ry? Between the brightest Light, and the most opake darkness? The purest Pleasure, and the most intense Pain? The most glori∣us Life, and ignominious Death? The Embra∣ces of God, and the Embraces of Devils? Between the sweet Society of Angels and Saints, and the horrid Shrieks of damned Spirits?</P>
<P>My Bretheren, can the momentary Plea∣sures and perishing Profits of Sin ballance the everlasting Racks of the Damned in Hell for it? Is there any Comparison between the immortal God, and your temporary Profits? The Beautiful Jesus, and your sordid Lusts? If there is none, then why linger ye, why halt ye? <HI>If you will deal truly with my Mast∣ter
<PB N="58" REF="003965_0057_10031A436B5CDC50"/>tell me.</HI> — Do ye ever intend poor Sin∣ners, to be espoused to Christ? Probably you'l say, yes. Why not now then? Is not Christ as Beautiful now as ever he was or will be? Are not your Souls as precious now as ever they will be, Holiness as excellent, Sin as sordid, Eternity as great, and Heaven as glorious? Way halt ye then unhappy Sinners, and linger in the dangerous Sodom of a State of Nature? <HI>Haste ye escape for your Lives</HI> to Christ, and be espoused to him, otherwise ye shall surely perish in the Burnings of his unquenchable Vengeance. But to be more particular, I be∣seech you for Christ, to consider the following expostulatory Arguments. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Does not the God that made you, and the Redeemer that bought you, deserve to be ser∣ved before the Devil, who hates you with the most malignant hatred? Why halt ye then, poor Sinners? <HI>If ye will deal truly with my Master, tell me,</HI> —</P>
<P N="2">2. Should not the best Bargain be first made? The greatest Interest first Secured? And is their any like that of the endless Happiness of your never dying Souls? Why halt ye then in so plain and self-evident a Case? <HI>If ye will deal kindly with my Master tell me,</HI> —</P>
<P N="3">3. Can you be safe and happy too soon? No surely; you do not think you can be Rich too soon. Then why halt ye, Sinners? <HI>And now if you will deal,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="59" REF="003965_0058_10031A454AEDC678"/>
4. Have not you delay'd and halted long enough already? Are not you ashamed of it? I am sure you have Reason; and will ye delay any longer yet? O unaccountable perverse madness! Have not ye readily in the mean Time obeyed Satan and your Lusts? Followed their Beck, and pursued their deadly Dictates with haste and Alacrity? And will ye shut your Ears with the deaf Adder, against the Charms of your Creator and Redeemer, cour∣ting you in the most condescending strains, in Order to confer upon you Liberty and Life? O strange madness!</P>
<P N="5">5. Is it not Dangerous, and do's it become a wise Man to expose his greatest Interest to the utmost Hazard for meer Trifles? Is not this the present Case? Why halt ye then, poor Sinners? <HI>And now if you will deal kindly and truly with my Master tell me, and if not tell me.</HI> —</P>
<P N="6">6. Without a full Compliance all your La∣bour is lost, its only <HI>he that endures to the end that shall be saved.</HI> Alass, have ye done and suffered so many things in vain, if it be yet in vain?</P>
<P>I shall conclude this Discourse, with offer∣ing in all Humility a word of Advice to Saints and Sinners. — And.</P>
<P N="1">1. Let me Address the Saints of God; are ye indeed espoused to <HI>Jesus,</HI> and have you experienc'd the Signs I before mention'd, — Then,</P>

But I pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed to offer a Word of Advice to ungodly Sinners in the following particulars, which, if ever you would be espoused to Jesus, you must comply with. — And.</P>
<P N="1">1. You must <HI>break of your Sins by righte∣ousness, and your iniquities by shewing mercy to the poor.</HI> Dan. 4.27:</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Rent</HI> your <HI>Hearts and not your Garments, and turn to God with fasting, weeping, and mourning,</HI> Joel. 2.12, 13. Cleanse your Hands, <HI>ye Sinners,</HI> and purify your Hearts, <HI>ye double Minded,</HI> be afflicted and mourn and weep, let your laughter be turned into mour∣ning and your Joy into heaviness, <HI>Jam.</HI> 4.8. — 10.</P>
<P N="3">3. Be diligent and attentive in hearing the Word, <HI>Heb.</HI> 10, 25. Frequent and fervent in praying to God for this mercy, <HI>Act.</HI> 8.22. and solemn and serious, in poring upon your present Misery, and these motives I have proposed in this Discourse, <HI>Ps.</HI> 50, 22. Which may the all-powerful God bless to your speedy Conviction sound Conversion and eter∣nal Salvation. I conclude with the Advice of the Apostle Paul to the <HI>Philipians</HI> and <HI>Hebrews,</HI> Philip. 2.1. — 6. and <HI>Heb.</HI> 3.7 8. If there be therefore any Consolation in Christ, if any Comfort of Love if any Fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies; fulfil ye my Joy, that ye be like minded having the
<PB N="66" REF="003965_0065_10031969DE3F7438"/>same Love, being of one Accord, of one Mind. Let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory, but in Lowliness of Mind, let each esteem other better then themselves. Look not every Man on his own Things, but every man also on the Things of others.</P>
<P>Wherefore, as the holy Ghost sayeth, <HI>to Day if ye will hear his Voice, harden not your Hearts.</HI></P>
