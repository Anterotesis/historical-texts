<P>The Nature of JUSTIFICATION opened:</P>
<P>A SERMON. PREACH'D AT <HI>PHILADELPHIA, January</HI> the 27th, 1744-5. On GALATIONS II. 16 WITH ENLARGEMENTS.</P>
<P>By GILBERT TENNENT, A. M. Minister of the Gospel in <HI>Philadelphia.</HI></P>
<P>Publish'd at the Desire of the Hearers.</P>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Rom. iii 28.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Therefore we conclude, that a Man is justified by Faith without the Deeds of the Law.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Rom. xi. 5, 6.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Even so then at this present Time also there is a Remnant according to the Election of Grace. And if by Grace, then it is no more of Works; otherwise Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of Works, then it is no more Grace: Otherwise Work is no more Work.</P>
<BIBL><HI>Titus iii. 8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>This is a faithful Saying, and these Things I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have be∣lieved in God, might be careful to maintain good Works: These Things are good and profitable unto Men.</P></Q>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>CANDID READER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE following Discourse treats <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pon a <HI>Foundation-Point</HI> of the Christian Religion, which it concerns all to un∣derstand well, and which I fear, many have but very superficial Notions of: This has doubtless a bad Influence upon their other religious Sentiments and Practice.</P>
<P>There is no other sure Foundation b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> CHRIST JESUS, if we build not upon him
<PB N="iv" REF="005697_0006_1026C19D37C81EF0"/>
for Pardon, Peace and Happiness, the Fa∣brick will surely fall, <HI>(debile Fundamentum fallit opus.)</HI> I have endeavoured to open this grand Article of Religion in the plainest Manner I could, that so the weakest Minds may have just Conceptions of it.</P>
<P>The Light in which I have set this Point, is agreeable to the Series of sacred Scripture, and the harmonious Suffrage of the reformed Churches of <HI>Scotland, Holland, France, Geneva, England, Germany,</HI> &amp;c. express'd in their Confessions of Faith; which altho' licentious Wits, who are disposed to be as loose and inconsistent in their <HI>Sentiments</HI> as <HI>Morals,</HI> may deride and burlesque as slavish Systems beneath their Notice, will notwith∣standing be esteemed by the Sober and Judicious, as instructive and valuable <HI>Summaries</HI> of divine Truth, so long as there be any Remains of true Religion in these Nations!</P>
<P>Its affecting to think how Mankind are inclin'd to run from one extreme to another. Some who have left the Principles of <HI>Armi∣nius,</HI> not thorowly understanding the Doc∣trines
<PB N="v" REF="005697_0007_1026C19EC1B77BD0"/>
of Grace, run into the contrary ex∣treme of <HI>Antinomianism,</HI> which is as disho∣nourable to Religion, and injurious to the Interest of it as the other, if not more so!</P>
<P>Now as Vertue consists in a Mediocrity between two Extremes, so do the Doctrines of Religion, and especially this of Justification, we should therefore beware, least while we labour to shun <HI>Scilla,</HI> we rush upon <HI>Caribdis.</HI></P>
<P>I had no Intention of publishing this Dis∣course when I preach'd it, having offered to the Publick a Sermon upon Justification some Years agone, but was induced hereto, by con∣sidering the Difficulty and Importance of the Subject, and the wrong Notions that many have of it, with design to give check to them. I was also inform'd, that a few of the Hearers were dissatisfied, and many more entertain'd with a Method of handling the Subject different from what they had heard; and therefore to remove the unreasonable Censures of some, and satisfy the Desires of others, I consented to its publication; not
<PB N="vi" REF="005697_0008_1026C1A045BE5640"/>
knowing that it had committed any Thing worthy of bands or of death. May it please the God of Truth to bless what is here offered for the Good of his Church, I add no more, but remain thine and the Churches Friend and Servant,</P>

<P>MY Brethren! As God the Father has from Eternity purposed to confer saving Benefits upon the Elect in Time <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Epes. i. 4.</NOTE>, so the Son of God in consequence hereof has made a Purchase of them by his Blood and Obe∣dience <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rev. v. 9.</NOTE>; and these very Benefits does the Holy Spirit apply in time to the Heirs of Salvation <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 8, 9.</NOTE>. Before which Application by the Holy Spirit's Influence, and Union of the Elect to Christ by Faith, they have no actual Right to the Blessings of Redemption, but <HI>are Children of Wrath and under con∣demnation.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="005697_0010_1026C1A7AC3594C8"/>
<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 3 John iii. 18.36.</NOTE>. <HI>Jesus Christ must be made of God to us</HI> (i. e. by application) <HI>Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redempti∣on</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. i. 30.</NOTE>. The <HI>Elect must be sanctified by the Spirit unto Obedience,</HI> and <HI>sprinkled with the Blood of Jesus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 2.</NOTE>: And hence Christ and his Benefits are frequently compar'd in Scrip∣ture, to such Things as do not profit us without Application; such as <HI>Cloaths, Meat, Drink</HI> and <HI>Medicine.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 18. John vi. 54, 45.</NOTE> <HI>Meat</HI> not eaten will not nourish us, <HI>Drink</HI> not drunk will not refresh us, a <HI>Garment</HI> not put on will not warm us, and <HI>Medicines</HI> not applied will not heal us: And therefore we may safely assert, that the <HI>Application</HI> of <HI>Re∣demption</HI> to the Soul, by the Holy Spirit's Influence, is as necessary in its Place in order to Salvation, as the <HI>Purchase</HI> of it by Christ's Blood and Obedience. As we are not condemn'd actually, on the Account of the Sin of our first Parents, until we actual∣ly exist and are united to them naturally, by partaking of a vitiated Nature derived
<PB N="9" REF="005697_0011_1026C1A932999530"/>
from them: So neither are we actually justified by the Righteousness of the second <HI>Adam,</HI> until we are spiritually united to him as our mistical Head by Faith <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John i. 12. Rom. v. 19.</NOTE>. But so soon as this Union is obtain'd, an actual Communion in the Benefits of Redemption immediately ensues, among which Justifica∣tion is a primary and principal one: Of this the Apostle treats in the Words of our Text. To understand which let it be considered, that the Occasion of writing this Epistle to the Churches of <HI>Galatia,</HI> (a Country in the <HI>Lesser Asia</HI>) was partly to reprove and re∣duce some Members of these Churches, who had as shamefully as perilously Apos∣tatiz'd from the important Doctrine of Jus∣tification by Faith alone, thro' the corrupt Influence of some false Teachers who crept in among them, and taught the Necessity of Circumcision and other Works of the Law, in order to the Justification of a Sin∣ner before God; and this they did with a political Design, to screne themselves from that Persecution which all the Christians
<PB N="10" REF="005697_0012_1026C1ABE3607138"/>
were then expos'd to who were not Cir∣cumcis'd; and in order to promote their new and pernicious Doctrine, they pursued the Method which is common to Hereticks and Seducers in every Age of the Church, <HI>viz.</HI> They made great Shews of Religion, commended themselves, traduc'd and vili∣fied the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> insinuating that he was no Apostle, that he had learn'd all he knew, from <HI>James, Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> and yet differ'd from them in Doctrine and Practice, as well as from himself. Now the Apostle does not only in this Epistle labour to re∣claim the erring <HI>Galatians,</HI> but likewise to vindicate his Character from the unjust and invidious Charges of the false Teachers: To this purpose the first and second Chap∣ters of this Epistle are chiefly spent· The inspir'd Writer does therein prove himself to be a true Apostle, and not to have learn'd what he taught from <HI>Peter, James</HI> or <HI>John,</HI> but that he had it by Revelation from Jesus Christ. In the Verses immediate∣ly preceeding our Text, the Apostle shews that he was so far from receiving the Gos∣pel he preach'd from <HI>Peter,</HI> that he faith∣fully
<PB N="11" REF="005697_0013_1026C1AD849829A8"/>
reprov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d him for his judaizing Dissi∣mulation, and then in the plainest Terms asserts Justification to be by Faith only. <HI>Knowing that a Man is not justified by the Works of the Law, but by the Faith of Jesus Christ,</HI> i. e. being perswaded that a Person is not freed from the Guilt of Sin, and adjudg'd righteous in the Sight of GOD by Acts of Obedience to the Law of <HI>Moses,</HI> either Ceremonial or Moral; but by Faith in Christ, which as an Eye beholds and as a Hand applies his Righteousness. The moral Law was doubtless intended by the Apostle as well as the Ceremonial:
<Q>For it is Manifest, that altho' this Questi∣on about Justification by Works began about Circumcision, and Works done in Obedience to the Ceremonial Law, yet the Determination of it extended farther; for the Apostle by the Law understands that Law by which is the Knowledge of Sin <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 20.</NOTE>. Now the Knowledge of Sin is neither, only or chiefly by the Cere∣monial Law; nor did ever any of those
<PB N="12" REF="005697_0014_1026C1B0F3AEF118"/>
against whom the Apostle argueth, think that Men could be justified by Obedi∣ence only to the <HI>Law contain'd in Or∣dinances;</HI> nor could boasting be excluded if Men might be justified by Works done in Obedience to the Moral Law: Nor was it the Violation of the Ceremo∣nial Law only that <HI>wrought Wrath,</HI> and expos'd Men to the <HI>Curse.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> vi 15. <HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 10. vid Pool<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Anotati. <HI>in</HI> Loc.</NOTE> The A∣postle proceeds to say, <HI>even we have believ'd in Jesus Christ that we might be justified by the Faith of Christ, and not by the Works of the Law.</HI> Here observe that the A∣postle represents Justification not as a Thing past but future, and as following Faith; as if he had said,
<Q>We <HI>Jews</HI> as well as the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> are in a State of Wrath and Condemnation before Faith, not∣withstanding of our Religious Priviledges, which being made sensible of, as well as the utter Insufficiency of any Acts of Obedience we have or can perform, to free us from the Guilt of Sin, and acquire for us a Right to Happiness; and being
<PB N="13" REF="005697_0015_1026C1B364152EC0"/>
perswaded of the Safety of entire De∣pendence upon the Righteousness of the Mediator for our Acceptance with God, we have consented to embrace him upon Gospel Terms, and reject all Refuges be∣sides him, and that because, <HI>by the Works of the Law shall no Flesh be justified, i. e.</HI> no mortal Man can rea∣sonably expect, or ever attain to be de∣clar'd Righteous before God, on the Ac∣count of his Obedience to the Law of God, because of its Imperfection.</Q></P>
<P>From what has been said it appears, that the Point to be discours'd upon from this Text, is the Manner of a Sinner's Justification before God. It cannot be Jus∣tification before Men, or the evidencing of the reality of our faith to them that is here intended; for good Works would not then be wholly rejected, being of princi∣pal Use in that Case; by those, as the Apostle <HI>James</HI> observes, <HI>our Faith is shewn</HI> or disco∣ver'd. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jam.</HI> 2.18.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> Its reality is manifested to others, and evidenc'd to our selves. And
<PB N="14" REF="005697_0016_1026C1B5D93DA798"/>
hence he concludes <HI>that a Man is justified by Works and not by Faith only,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Jam. ii. 24.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> in the sight of Men. High Pretences to and a great Bluster about Faith and Ex∣periences, when these Things are not crown'd with a holy and humble Conversation, are justly rejected by the Sober and Judici∣ous, as Instances of Hypocrisy and Delu∣sion. That Faith that don't produce good Works is <HI>dead</HI> and <HI>unprofitable,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jam. ii. 14, 17.</NOTE> and therefore cannot be the Instrument of our Justification before God. What has been said serves to remove the seeming Contrari∣ety between the two Apostles <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>James</HI> and shew their Harmony: To which let me add, that they wrote to different Sorts of People, <HI>Paul</HI> directed his Discourse of Justification without Works to <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and such as were of a Self-righteous Cast, who depended securely upon their Acts of Obedience, and tho't thereby in some De∣gree at least to procure the divine Favour: These ambitious <HI>Babel-builders,</HI> the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> labours to shake from the Summit of
<PB N="15" REF="005697_0017_1026C1B769D0AE70"/>
their Self-righteousness in point of Depen∣dence, that so being made <HI>poor in spirit,</HI> they might learn to <HI>submit to,</HI> and lean alone upon the Mediator's Righteousness for acceptance with God. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 8, 9.</NOTE></P>
<P>But the Apostle <HI>James</HI> had to do with a <HI>Club</HI> of <HI>Libertines,</HI> who made high Pre∣tences to Faith and Justification by it, while they went on in a Course of Impiety in Practice: These hardy Hypocrites he takes to task and shews the Vanity of their Pre∣tences, by declaring, that that Faith that justified us before God, was a vital active Grace, productive of good Works; and that good Works were necessary to evidence to the World about us, the Truth of our Faith and the reality of our Justification, whatever lawless Libertines might unjustly mutter against them notwithstanding! But to return: As it is not Justification before Men that is intended in our Text, as ap∣pears from what has been said; so neither is it a Justification in the Sight of Con∣science, for good Works are of great Use
<PB N="16" REF="005697_0018_1026C1BA63C5F968"/>
to evidence thereto the Safety of our State: <HI>Hereby</HI> (says the Apostle <HI>John) we do know that we know him, if we keep his Command∣ments; and he that saith I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar and the Truth is not in him</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 John ii. 3, 4.</NOTE>: (And elsewhere he assures us) <HI>that if we say we have Fel∣lowship with him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not the Truth; but if we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have Fellowship one with another</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John i. 6, 7</NOTE>: <HI>i. e.</HI> If we go on in a Course of Holiness, which is here call'd Light, we have an Evidence of true Communion with God, which is a Fruit of Reconciliation to him.</P>
<P>It remains therefore, that it is Justificati∣on before God only, that the Apostle treats of in our Text, and asserts <HI>to be by Faith without the Works of the Law.</HI> This be∣ing the Substance and Scope of the Text, I shall in order to prepare it for Improvement, speak upon the two following Heads, <HI>viz:</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>Attempt to explain the Nature of Justification.</HI> And</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="17" REF="005697_0019_1026C1BDCE8BB1A0"/>II. <HI>Prove that it is without the Works of the Law.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>That the Word <HI>justify</HI> is not to be taken in a <HI>moral Sense,</HI> as intending a real, inward Change of the Temper and Disposition of the Soul, as the Papists imagine, (for that is properly call'd Sanctification) but in a <HI>Law-Sense,</HI> as importing a juridical Act of God, whereby as a Judge he acquits the Sinner from Guilt and accepts him into Favour, appears from the following Considerations, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> From the etymological <HI>Derivation</HI> of the Word <HI>justify,</HI> it is deriv'd from a Word that signifies <HI>Right,</HI> as judicially pro∣nounced according to law. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dicaiutai a dice.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> From its common <HI>Acceptation</HI> in Scripture, the Passages that treat of Jus∣tification can admit of no other than a <HI>Law-Sense;</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ex. xxiii. 7. Deut. xxv. 1. Job ix. 1, 2. Psalm cxliii. 2. Prov. xvii. 15. Luke xviii. 14. Rom. iii. 4, 5, 6,—24, 25, 26.</NOTE> and hence the judicial Process is describ'd in the sacred Writings; mention is made of the Law accusing, and of the Guilty arraign'd, as being without Apology,
<PB N="18" REF="005697_0020_1026C1C0672BC178"/>
<HI>having their Mouths stopt;</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 19.</NOTE> and divine Justice is likewise represented as demanding Punishment. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 25, 26.</NOTE> And Christ is set forth as an Advocate pleading our Cause, by the important Argument of his Sufferings, and thereby of his Satisfaction to Justice; and hence the Apostles <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> inform us, <HI>that we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, who ever lives to make Intercession for us</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John ii. 1.</NOTE>; and elsewhere Christ is said to <HI>appear as a Lamb slain in the midst of the Throne,</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Rev. v. 6</NOTE> <HI>and that his Blood speaks better Things than the Blood of</HI> Abel <NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 24</NOTE>. The Scrip∣ture also mentions a <HI>Throne of Grace</HI> before which we must come, <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heb. iv. 16.</NOTE> and speaks of God as a Judge, passing the Sentence of Abso∣lution. <NOTE N="¶¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 19, 20. Rom. iv. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Justification in Scripture is op∣poss'd to <HI>condemnation;</HI> to this Purpose are these Words of the Apostle in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans, viz. Who shall lay any Thing to the Charge of God's Elect? It is God that
<PB N="19" REF="005697_0021_1026C1C1F668CD70"/>
Justifieth, who is he that condemneth?</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 33, 34.</NOTE> Now as Accusation and Condemnation are in Judgment, so by consequence is Justi∣fication.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The <HI>equivalent Phrases</HI> in Scripture whereby our Justification is de∣scrib'd, relate to Judgment or a Course of Justice; hence our Lord saith, <HI>that he that believeth on him that sent him, shall not come into Judgment;</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">John v. 24.</NOTE> for so the orignal Word primarily signifies; <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Crisin a crine <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o.</NOTE> it is likewise call'd <HI>Reconciliation,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 10.</NOTE> <HI>remission of Sin, and imputing of Righteousness.</HI> <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>Well, seeing the Word <HI>Justify,</HI> is evi∣dently a <HI>Law-Term,</HI> and alludes to civil Courts of Judicature, it will therefore help us to understand Justification, if we com∣pare it with the <HI>Process</HI> of Civil Courts, which consists especially in three Things, <HI>viz.</HI> (1st.) A Person is charged with guilt. (2dly,) He pleads to his Charge. (3dly,) If the Plea be relevant or sufficient, he is discharg'd by the Judge; thus it is in Jus∣tification.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="20" REF="005697_0022_1026C1C46D61BCA0"/>1st. The Elect are <HI>charg'd</HI> with <HI>guilt</HI> by the Law and Justice, and hence the Apo∣stle assures us in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans, that whatsoever the Law says, it says to those that are under the Law; that every Mouth may be stoped, and all the World may become guilty before God.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom. iii. 19.</HI> Hupidocos to theo (O hupo ten dicen oon) <HI>under God's condemnatory Sentence.</HI></NOTE> Here observe my Brethren, that the Elect before they are enabled to believe in Christ, are under the Law and guilty before God, (or in his Sight) now what is guilt, but an Obligation to suffer eternal Punishment for Sin? The Almighty having made reason∣able Creatures capable of moral Govern∣ment, was pleased to give them a Law to direct them in it, and that arm'd with the Threatning of eternal Death against the Transgressor; the Threatning being but equal to the demerit of Sin, and necessary as a Guard to screen the Law from Insult and Contempt; and God having denounc'd it, his Justice and Truth were engag'd to see to the Execution of it upon the Trans∣gressor: Now we have sinn'd or transgress'd
<PB N="21" REF="005697_0023_1026C1C7D2207120"/>
the Law, and therefore are bound by the Threatning annex'd to it to suffer Punish∣ment.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Sinner being accus'd, must <HI>plead</HI> for himself, either in his own Person or by <HI>Proxy</HI> or Advocate, for Silence gives consent to the Condemnation. The <HI>English</HI> Law orders those that won't plead to be press'd to Death. If a Person be not ac∣cus'd, he may be indeed <HI>prais'd</HI> but can∣not be <HI>justify'd,</HI> and if he is accus'd he must plead or die. Now</P>

<P>Doctor <HI>Bates</HI> observes respecting the Satisfaction of Christ, <Q>that God is to be considered as a Governor who may, by pure Jurisdiction, dispense with the Execution of the Law upon those Considerations which fully answer the Ends of Government. The Law is not executed according to the Letter of it, for then no Sinner can be saved; but repenting Believers are free from Condemnation. Nor is it a∣brogated, for then no Obligation remains as to the Duty or Penalty of it: But Men are still bound to obey it, and impenitent Infidels are still under the Curse: <HI>The Wrath of God abides upon them.</HI> But 'tis <HI>relax'd</HI> as to the Punishment by the merciful Con∣descention of the Law-giver.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Some Laws are not capable of Relaxation in their own Nature; because there is included moral Ini∣quity in the Relaxation. As the Commands to love God and obey Conscience, can never loose their binding Force. 'Tis a universal Rule that suffers no Exception, God cannot deny himself; therefore he can never allow Sin that directly opposes the Perfections of his Nature. Besides some Laws cannot be relax'd <HI>ex hypothesi,</HI> upon the Account of the Divine Decree which makes them Irrevocable, as that all who die in their Impenitency shall be damned. Now there was no express Sign annex'd to the Sanction of the original Law, to inti∣mate that it should be unalterable as to the Letter of it. The Threatning declar'd the Desert of Sin in the Offender, and the Right of punishing in the Superior; but 'tis so to be understood as not to frustrate the Power of the Law-giver to relax the Punishment upon wise and just Reasons.</Q> <HI>vid.

<P>But in order to understand this important Point, it will be necessary to enquire, what
<PB N="33" REF="005697_0035_1026C1E7B93A3138"/>
is the Ransom Christ has paid, and wherein appears its <HI>equivalency</HI> to the demerit of Sin?</P>
<P>Now the Ransom Christ has offered, was not the <HI>essential Sanctity</HI> or Righteousness of his divine <HI>Nature,</HI> for this could neither be offered or accepted for our Guilt, this he had from Eternity, but the Scriptures speak of a Ransom in Time; neither could that Righteousness be made any way ours, unless we became <HI>God</HI> and were united to him, either <HI>essentially,</HI> as the Persons of the Trinity among themselves are one in Es∣sence, which is impossible in it self and blasphemous to imagine, or <HI>personally</HI> as the human and divine Nature are united in the Person of Christ, which is also absurd and blasphemous; <HI>for there is</HI> (but) <HI>one God and one Mediator between God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 5.</NOTE> And truly if the Righteousness of the divine Nature cou'd be made ours, (which is impossible) it wou'd destroy the Necessity of that Righ∣teousness, which was purchased by the Life and Death of our dearest Lord, because being <HI>infinite,</HI> it would be alone sufficient.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="005697_0036_1026C1E9441ABC48"/>Nor is the <HI>Ransom</HI> the great Redeemer paid, the <HI>original</HI> and inherent <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> of his <HI>human Nature,</HI> because that was necessary in the Person of the Mediator, as a previous (or foregoing) Qualification, in order to his making of Satisfaction: The Priest that was to offer for us, must of Necessity be <HI>holy and harmless, one that knew no Sin, and was a Stranger to Guile and Deceit.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 21. 1 Pet. ii. 22.</NOTE> The inherent Righteous∣ness of our Lord, may more properly be call'd, the Righteousness of his <HI>Person</HI> than of his <HI>Merit.</HI></P>
<P>But positively, the Ransom paid by Christ to divine Justice, consists in the <HI>Obedience</HI> he perform'd to the Law of God as Medi∣ator, and in the Sufferings which he endured for the Sins of the Elect in their Room and Place; and hence he is said, <HI>to be made of a Woman, made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law, that we might receive the Adoption of Sons.</HI> And we are expresly said to be <HI>redeem'd by his precious Blood and Death:</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. i. 7.

<P>Now that the <HI>Ransom</HI> our Lord offered was <HI>equivalent</HI> to the Demerit of Sin appears thus: The <HI>Guilt</HI> of all the Elect could be no more than <HI>infinite,</HI> for more cannot be in the Nature of Things; now the Price that Christ paid could not be less, if it be considered, that <HI>it was not corruptible Things, such as Silver and Gold, but the precious Blood of the spotless Lamb of God, (yea) of the only begotten Son of God,</HI> yea my Brethren of God himself. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Act. xx. 28 Acts viii. 32▪</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> of a Person who was truly and really <HI>God-Man.</HI> Add to to this, that our Lord suffer'd in the most perfect Manner, both willingly and pati∣ently: <HI>In the Volumn of thy Book,</HI> (said he) <HI>it is written of me: Lo, I come to do thy Will, O God, and thy Law is within my Heart.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. xl. 7, 8.</NOTE> <HI>He was led as a Lamb to the Slaughter, and as a Sheep before her Shear∣ers is Dumb, so he opened not his Mouth.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Act. xx. 28 Acts viii. 32▪</NOTE> He not only endured Severities from Men in Name and Body, but which was <HI>in∣finitely

<P>But Christ's Merit arises also from the <HI>condignity</HI> of his Obedience, inasmuch as not only a divine Person, one in the Form of God and equal to him obey'd, but the Obedience it self considered, as proceeding from God-Man was not due; the Law only obliges Men to Obedience, not GOD-MAN; the Law oblig'd the Guilty to suffer, but not the Innocent.</P>
<P>It is well observ'd by Doctor <HI>Ridgley,</HI> <Q>That the Satisfaction demanded by the
<PB N="38" REF="005697_0040_1026C1F4956EBD78"/>
Justice of God, for the Expiation of Sin, must contain in it two Things: Namely 1st, It must be of infinite Value, otherwise it would not be sufficient to compensate for the Injuries offered to the divine Name by Sin, which is objectively infi∣nite. And</Q></P>
<P N="2">2dly: <Q>That it must bear some Simili∣tude or Resemblance as to the <HI>Matter</HI> of it, to that Debt which was due from those for whom it was given. Here we must consider, that the Debt due from us was two-fold.</Q></P>
<P N="1">1st: <Q>A Debt of sinless <HI>Obedience,</HI> whereby the Glory of God's Sovereignty may be secur'd, and the Honour of his Law maintain'd:</Q> This Debt is still justly demanded, because we have lost the Power of performing it thro' our own Default.</P>

<P><PB N="39" REF="005697_0041_1026C1F6B577B6B0"/>Now the Satisfaction Christ has made, has these Ingredients; the Person satisfying, was and is of infinite <HI>Dignity,</HI> which can∣not but derive an infinite <HI>Value</HI> on his Per∣formances and Sufferings as a Surety; and what he did and suffered did bear some Similitude to the Debt we ow'd, as to the <HI>Matter</HI> or <HI>Substance</HI> of it: <HI>e. g.</HI> He per∣fectly obey'd in our Place the Precept of the Law and endured the Penalty of Death.

<P>From all which Considerations complex∣ly considered, it appears that the Obedience of Christ was of infinite Value, and there∣fore an equivalent Satisfaction to Justice for the Sins of those he represented: And seeing that the active and passive Obedience of Christ, was not due from him to the Law, considered as <HI>God-Man,</HI> it might be therefore imputed to others.</P>
<P>But because this Point of the <HI>Satisfac∣tion</HI> of Christ, is of infinite Moment in the Christian Religion, I wou'd therefore offer the following Hints before I proceed far∣ther, in Confirmation and Illustration of it.</P>
<P>Natural Reason instructs us that there is a God, from whom all Things are deriv'd, and by whom they are govern'd.</P>
<P><PB REF="005697_0043_1026C1FD80A82AC8"/>This supreme Being having made intel∣ligent Creatures capable of moral Homage, it was but reasonable that he should give them a Law to direct them in it, especi∣ally seeing they cou'd not know such Pre∣cepts as took their Rise from his absolute So∣vereignty, (which deserves Honour, as well as his other Attributes) without some Inti∣mations from himself.</P>
<P>A Law being given, it's highly reasonable that Obedience to it should be enforc'd by Penalties equal to the Transgressions thereof.</P>
<P>Now seeing by every Violation of the Law, the infinite Majesty of the Legisla∣tor is affronted, and infinite Obligations to serve him, which the Creature is laid un∣der, by reason of the essential Excellency and communicative Goodness of God are broken, therefore an infinite Guilt is con∣tracted by every Sin.</P>
<P>This Guilt, the Judge and Legislator, because of his natural Holiness, his govern∣ing Wisdom, Truth and Justice, cannot pass by without an equal Satisfaction.</P>
<P>But this the Sinner cannot perform, be∣cause he is finite, and therefore either he
<PB N="42" REF="005697_0044_1026C1FF0856A0D8"/>
must suffer eternally, or a Surety under∣take for him, and do and suffer in his Room and Place, what he was and is uncapable of.</P>
<P>Now the Person that so interposes must be <HI>Man,</HI> that he might be capable of suf∣fering, for the Deity is impassible; and it is but just and reasonable that the Nature that sinn'd shou'd suffer, that the Sin of Man should be punish'd in Man.</P>
<P>And indeed it is as necessary, that the Person interposing be <HI>God,</HI> that so the human Nature shou'd be Supported under its Sufferings, which being equal to the Demerit of Sin, and consequently infinite, wou'd otherways destroy it. It is also ne∣cessary, that the Mediator should be God, that so an infinite Dignity might be put upon the Sufferings and Obedience of his human Nature by its Union to the Divine, that so the Satisfaction made might be Equivalent to the Debt contracted.</P>
<P>Now there is no God-Man but our JE∣SUS; it remains therefore, that he is the only Mediator, who by performing the <HI>Righteousness of the Law,</HI> hath purchas'd
<PB N="43" REF="005697_0045_1026C2008EF07A68"/>
for the Elect a Freedom from the Guilt of Sin, and a Right to eternal Happiness. This Right purchas'd for the Elect by their Surety, 'twas previously concerted in the Covenant of Redemption, should be apply'd to them in Time by Faith. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zech. vi 13.

<P>The Right purchas'd for the Elect is kept in the Hand of the Mediator, until

<P>Then is the elect Sinner arraign'd by Justice for the Violation of the Law, which Charge being true the Sinners Mouth is shut, and all his Pleas are silenc'd: But Christ the Faithful Advocate interceeds with the Father, and urges that the Claim of Right he bought by Blood for them, be now communicated to them, and they ab∣solv'd. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John xi 42.</NOTE></P>

<P>To this End therefore the Holy Spirit forms Faith in the elect Sinner, and ena∣bles him thereby to accept the Redeemer.</P>

the reform'd Protestant Churches in their Confessions of Faith.</P>
<P>Having spoken something concerning the <HI>Term Justification,</HI> together with its <HI>Allu∣sion</HI> to <HI>Civil Courts,</HI> and <HI>Mode,</HI> I shall proceed to offer a brief Gloss upon the venerable <HI>Westminster</HI> Assembly's Descrip∣tion of its <HI>Nature,</HI> which is as follows, <HI>viz. Justification is an Act of God's Free Grace, whereby he pardoneth all our Sins and accepteth us as Righteous in his Sight, only for the Righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and receiv'd by Faith alone.</HI></P>
<P>Now there are these following Particulars contain'd in the aforesaid Description which deserve our Notice, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Justification,</HI> and that is <HI>GOD.</HI> This the Apostle positively asserts in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans</HI> in the fol∣lowing Words, <HI>It is God that justifieth</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 33.</NOTE> It is against God that Sin is committed, and therefore none can forgive it authorita∣tively but him. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mark ii. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Jehovah</HI> alone is Judge of all the Earth, and Author of that Law
<PB N="47" REF="005697_0049_1026C20BF0F055E8"/>
by which Man is to be rul'd, and according to which Judgment must pass; and there∣fore it is only he that can acquit from the Violations of it, and judicially declare Per∣sons to be Righteous: Without this in our Favour our justifying ourselves, * or others justifying us, will be to no avail. ‡‡</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>General Nature</HI> of <HI>Justi∣fication,</HI> an <HI>Act,</HI> the General Assembly call it so, and not a Work as I conceive for two Reasons:</P>
<P N="1">1st. To prove that the Change produc'd by it is only <HI>relative</HI> of the State, and not <HI>real</HI> or inward of the Temper and Dispo∣sitions of the Soul. We come into the World in our fallen State, under a twofold melancholy Disorder, viz. <HI>Moral</HI> and <HI>Pe∣nal, i. e.</HI> we are not only under the Power and Pollution of Sin, but likewise under the Guilt of it, or expos'd by it to Con∣demnation. Now Sanctification cures the former, and Justification the latter. Suppo∣sing a Person was condem'd to die for Re∣bellion, and at the same Time labour'd under bodily Diseases, such as the Leprosie and Consumption, you know the removing
<PB N="48" REF="005697_0050_1026C20F63770A60"/>
of the Sentence of Condemnation would not heal the Diseases; a proper Application must be made to them of a suitable Medi∣cine besides the other, otherwise the Person would still be miserable.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Another Reason is to signify that the Sentence of Justification passes upon the Sinner at once; when he believes, in a Moment his State is alter'd he is no more <HI>under the Law, (i. e.</HI> as a Covenant of Works) <HI>but under Grace.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 14.</NOTE> <HI>There is there∣fore now, no Condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the Flesh but after the Spirit.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 1.</NOTE> Here observe that in the Apostles Judgment the Elect, before a vital Union to Christ, are under Condemnation, but being united to him by Faith they are freed from it entirely and at once; seeing Justification respects the Person he must be either wholly justified or condemn'd, there is no Medium. There are, no doubt, various Degrees of our Per∣swasion of this Matter respecting ourselves; but that does not alter the Case at all, for ye know my Brethren that there is a vast
<PB N="49" REF="005697_0051_1026C210E9C9DC58"/>
Difference between the Knowledge of a Thing and the Thing itself.</P>
<P>From what has been said it appears, that Justification is <HI>no immanent Act</HI> of God, for all such are Eternal, nor are they distinct from God himself; but the Act of Justification is at the Time of believing and not before, and has an Effect without him; it terminates on the Sinner, and makes a relative Change respecting his State.</P>
<P>Neither does the Notion of an <HI>immanent Act</HI> answer the End of Justification, which is to free the Sinner from Law Charges, whereby he was before impleaded, and therefore we may safely assert, that Justi∣fication, as it proceeds from God, and al∣ters the State of the Person upon whom it terminates, is a <HI>transient Act.</HI> But,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Another particular in the As∣sembly's Description is, the <HI>impulsive</HI> or <HI>first moving Cause</HI> of <HI>Justification,</HI> and that is <HI>Free-Grace.</HI> The Fountain from which the Act of Justification flows is pure Grace, this the Apostle asserts in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans</HI> in the following Words, <HI>being justi∣fied
<PB N="50" REF="005697_0052_1026C2136B987620"/>
freely by his Grace.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 24.</NOTE> The first Wheel that sets all the rest in Motion is the un∣merited unexcited Kindness of God, or <HI>the Good Pleasure of his Will.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Eph. i. 5.</NOTE> Justification is an important Priviledge which all are by Nature equally unworthy of, and e∣qually unable to acquire or requite; and yet it is conferr'd on some, which manifests the Glory of Sovereign Grace, and shews us that God <HI>hath Mercy on whom he will have Mercy.</HI> <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. ix. 18.</NOTE> We are all by Nature like Children lying in the open Field in our Blood and Polution, in the most ruinous and expos'd Circumstances; and yet even then the gracious God has Compassion on the Elect, and says to them <HI>Live.</HI> <NOTE N="¶‡" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xvi. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly:</HI> The next Particular in the aforesaid Description, respects the <HI>Parts</HI> or <HI>Branches</HI> of <HI>Justification,</HI> which are these two, <HI>viz.</HI> Pardon and Acceptance.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Pardon</HI> is properly a cancelling, or dissolving the Sinners Obligation to suffer Punishment, by vertue of the Threatning of the Law against Transgressors. Pardon <HI>supposes</HI> (1st,) a Law given for the Govern∣ment
<PB N="51" REF="005697_0053_1026C214F1969480"/>
of Mankind, and that recommended by Sanctions or the Threatning of Pu∣nishments against Delinquents, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> without this it wou'd be but an Advice, and no Law, properly speaking. (2dly,) It sup∣poses a Breach or Transgression of the Law, which the Apostle <HI>John</HI> calls <HI>Sin.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 John iii. 4.</NOTE> (3dly) It supposes an Obligation to suffer Punish∣ment for Sin, arising from the Sanction of the Law. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 6.</NOTE> On the other Hand, Pardon <HI>im∣plies</HI> the Removal, not of the <HI>intrinsick Evil</HI> or <HI>Desert</HI> of Sin, for that always re∣mains vile and deserves Punishment, but only of the aforesaid Obligation to suffer it by reason of the Law; tho' <HI>there be no Con∣demnation to those that are in Christ Jesus,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 1</NOTE> yet there is something condemnable in them, and hence the Psalmist pronounces a Blessing upon those <HI>whose Iniquity is for∣given, and whose Sin is covered.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Psalm xxxii. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>When a Person is Justify'd, all his Sins past are actually pardon'd, and a Remedy is given in the Righteousness of Christ against Sins to come; which before they are par∣don'd
<PB N="52" REF="005697_0054_1026C2192EE17AE8"/>
must be lamented, and the Righte∣ousness of Christ apply'd, by the renew'd Exercise of Faith. <HI>I acknowledged,</HI> (said the Psalmist) <HI>my Transgressions unto thee, and thou forgavest the Iniquity of my Sin.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm xxxii. v.</NOTE> And hence we are instructed in the Pat∣tern of Prayer our Lord has given us, to <HI>pray daily for the Remission of Sins.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. vi. 11, 12.</NOTE> Sins not committed, cannot be forgiven actual∣ly; where no Guilt is, it cannot be taken away.</P>
<P>Altho' Justification be properly of the Law-State of the Person and unalterable, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 34, 35</NOTE> so that the Partaker of it shall never by Sin come under the Condemnation of the Law, as a Covenant of Works, being un∣der another Dispensation, <HI>the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, having made him free from the Law of Sin and Death.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>Yet the Dispensation of Grace under which the Believer is, has also its Sanctions; and hence its call'd, <HI>the Law of Christ.</HI> <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 2.</NOTE> Jehovah hereby requires <HI>Obedience of his

Deut. i. 37.</NOTE> Now this expossedness of the justify'd Per∣son to the Corrections of the Almighty, both outward and inward, is a Kind of <HI>Guilt,</HI> which may justly excite an awful <HI>Fear of God,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxix. 120.</NOTE> and is not to be remov'd without the Exercise of Repentance and Faith.</P>
<P>But to proceed: The other Part or Branch of Justification, is God's accepting of us as Righteous in his Sight; and hence the believing Elect are said <HI>to be made Ac∣cepted in the Beloved;</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ephes. i. 6.</NOTE> Jehovah first ac∣cepts their <HI>Persons,</HI> and then their <HI>Perfor∣mances;</HI> and hence he is said, <HI>to have had a Respect to</HI> Abel <HI>and to his Offering.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gen iv. 4.</NOTE> Tho' the Almighty does not find in us such an inherent Righteousness as the Law requires, yet on the Account of the Righ∣teousness of Christ imputed to us, which is equal to the Demands of the Law, he
<PB N="54" REF="005697_0056_1026C21D2227F138"/>
authoritatively Declares us Righteous as a Judge; and therefore in this respect, <HI>he beholds not Iniquity in</HI> Jacob, <HI>and Peverse∣ness in</HI> Israel. Now by this judicial De∣claration, the believing Elect are entitled to Happiness; and therefore it is represent∣ed, <HI>as a Crown of Righteousness given by the righteous Judge.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. vi. 8.</NOTE> This leads me to a</P>
<P><HI>Fifth</HI> Particular contain'd in the Assem∣bly's Description; and that is the <HI>merito∣rious Cause,</HI> or <HI>Matter</HI> of our <HI>Justification,</HI> which is the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of <HI>Christ, viz.</HI> Of his Life and Death. That this is equal to the Demands of the Law and Justice, and therefore a sufficient Foundation for Justification, I have before shewn, and therefore for the Sake of Brevity, must only add, an Instructive Answer of the Reverend and Ingenious Mr. <HI>David Clark∣son,</HI> to an Objection of some, against the Necessity of the Imputation of Christ's <HI>ac∣tive Obedience,</HI> because of the suppos'd Sufficiency of his <HI>passive</HI> without it, to free
<PB N="55" REF="005697_0057_1026C220C268DDF8"/>
from Punishment, and procure a Title to Happiness. To this Objection, he replies in the following Manner:
<Q>Indeed we should not separate what the Lord hath not disjoyn'd: The Obedience and Suf∣ferings of Christ are not disjoyn'd in themselves, in their Virtue or Effects. Not in themselves: He suffered in all his Obedience, and obeyed in all his Suffer∣ngs.—There was Obedience in all his Sufferings, because he suffered in Complyance with his Father's Will: And there was sufferings in all his Obe∣dience, because his Acts of Obedience, were Acts of Humiliation and Abase∣ment, all perform'd by the Son of God in the Form of a Servant.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nor in their Virtue: His Obedience was both meritorious and satisfactory; and his Sufferings were both satisfactory and meritorius. His Obedience was not only meritorious, but also satisfactory; if not as Obedience, yet as it was Penal.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And his Sufferings were not only sa∣tisfactory, but also meritorious; if not
<PB N="56" REF="005697_0058_1026C22333631B08"/>
as they were great, yet as they were obediential.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Nor in their Effects: His Sufferings could not have satisfied Justice, without his perfect Obedience. Because Suffer∣ings, simply considered, without Obe∣dience, find no Acceptance with God; his perfect Obedience could not have procur'd for us a Title to Life; for this we could not have, unless freed from Condemnation by his Sufferings.</Q>
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Discour. p. 241.</NOTE></P>
<P>I proceed to enquire how Christ's Righteousness becomes ours?</P>
<P>Now this the Assembly observes is done two Ways, <HI>viz.</HI> by <HI>Imputation</HI> and <HI>Faith.</HI> And</P>
<P><HI>First:</HI> God imputes the Righteousness of Christ to the believing Elect: By <HI>imput∣ing,</HI> we understand God's reckoning, or placing to our Account, what was done and suffered by Christ as a Surety in our Room and Place, as much as tho' we had done and suffered these Things in our own Per∣sons. This the sacred Scriptures assert,
<PB N="57" REF="005697_0059_1026C224B99491F0"/>
while they signify <HI>the Blessedness of the Man unto whom God imputeth Righteousness with∣out Works;</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 6.</NOTE> and declare that <HI>Christ was made Sin for us, that we might be made the Righteousness of God in him.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 21.</NOTE> And else∣where he is call'd, <HI>the Lord our Righteous∣ness,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxiii. 16.</NOTE> <HI>and the End of the Law for Righ∣teousness, to every one that Believeth.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. iv.</NOTE> And we are farther told, <HI>that as by one Man's Disobedience many were made Sinners, so by the Obedience of One, shall many be made Righteous.</HI> <NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Rom. v. 19.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> when they believe.</P>
<P>Surely if ever Man be Justify'd, he must have a Righteousness to justify him equal to the Demands of the Law; <HI>the Judge of all the Earth must needs do right,</HI> and there∣fore cannot pronounce those Just that are not so; in that Degree the Law requires, either <HI>inherently</HI> or <HI>imputatively,</HI> the Sanc∣tions of the first Covenant, because of the Justice and Truth of God establishing them must be fulfill'd; hence our Lord himself assures us, that <HI>till Heaven and Earth pass,
<PB N="58" REF="005697_0060_1026C2272D8EFAA8"/>
one Jot or one Tittle shall in no ways pass from the Law, till all be fulfilled.</HI> <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. v. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now there is no Righteousness but that of the blessed Jesus, that can answer the Law's Demands. The Law requires perfect and perpetual Obedience, and threatens Death for the least Defect. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 10.</NOTE> But <HI>we have all sinn'd and come short of the Glo∣ry of God.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 23.</NOTE> <HI>There is not a just Man on Earth that doeth good and sinneth not.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Eccles. vii. 20.</NOTE> <HI>If we say we are perfect, our Mouth shall prove us perverse.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Job ix. 20.</NOTE> <HI>If we say we have no Sin, we are Lyars and the Truth is not in us.</HI> <NOTE N="¶¶" PLACE="foot">1 John i. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>So that without another Righteousness besides our own, we cannot be sav'd. Now the Righteousness of Christ cannot be made ours any other Way than by <HI>Imputation;</HI> his individual Righteousness cannot be in∣fus'd into us, individual Actions and Pas∣sions terminate in the Subject of them. I may add, that the aforesaid Imputation is sufficient to our Justification appears thus, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="005697_0061_1026C22A8CF736C0"/><HI>First:</HI> The Covenant of Works tho' it made no mention of a Surety, yet it did not exclude one, in case there ever should be a Necessity.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly:</HI> The active and passive Obedi∣ence of Christ as a Surety, answer'd the Law's Precept and Sanction; yea <HI>magnified it and made it honourable,</HI> and so gave room for the Display of those divine Perfections, which were engag'd to issue the Threats of the first Covenant; and thus <HI>God may be Just, and yet the Justifier of him that be∣lieves in Jesus,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 26.</NOTE> and declare his Righte∣ousness in the Remission of Sins that are past thro' Christ's Propitiation.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly:</HI> The Almighty having in infi∣nite Condescension provided a Surety and accepted of his Satisfaction under that Character, as appears by his Release from the Prison of the Grave, and triumphant Ascension to the Seat of the Blessed. <HI>He was taken from Prison and from Judgment, delivered for our Offences and raised again for our Justification; God
<PB N="60" REF="005697_0062_1026C22CF8035B00"/>
manifest in the Flesh and justified in the Spi∣rit; i. e.</HI> openly acquitted, as his Peoples Representative, by his Resurrection from the Dead, which was perform'd thro' the holy Spirit's Agency. As Mediator <HI>he of∣fered a Sacrifice to God of a sweet-smelling Savour.</HI> The Apostle lays great Stress up∣on the Resurrection of Christ, while he assur'd the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> that <HI>if Christ be not raised their Faith was vain, and they were yet in their Sins:</HI> The Reason is this: The Lord Jesus being Arrested by Justice as the Surety of the Elect, in order to pay the Debt they ow'd; if he had continued under the Arrest, it wou'd have prov'd his Insolvency, or Inability to perform his Engagements; but having pay'd the Debt, or <HI>finished</HI> his Purchase, <HI>God hath raised him up, having loosed the Pains of Death, because it was not possible he should be holden of it.</HI> Now I say, the Father having accepted what our Lord did and suffered as a Surety, it is but reasonable that he should impute what he did and suffered to those whom he repre∣sented, at the <HI>Time</HI> and in the <HI>Manner</HI>
<PB N="61" REF="005697_0063_1026C22E809C72C8"/>
prefix'd by his Purpose. Which brings me to speak upon the</P>
<P><HI>Second</HI> Way by which the Righteousness of Christ becomes ours, and that is <HI>Faith; 'It is received by Faith alone.'</HI> say the Assembly.</P>
<P>When a Person believes, he has a right to conclude that he is Justified, and to claim all the Privileges that issue from it, and not before. This is what we Term Justification by Faith, which therefore can∣not be before Faith; for that which con∣veys a Claim of Right, must it self neces∣sarily exist before the Claim conveyed by it.</P>
<P>The sacred Scriptures frequently repre∣sent Justification to be by Faith; thus it is said in the Epistle of <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Galatians, the Scriptures foreseeing, that God</HI> WOULD <HI>Justify the Heathen thro' Faith, preach'd before the Gospel unto</HI> Abraham. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 8.</NOTE> And elsewhere it is said, <HI>seeing it is one God who</HI> SHALL <HI>Justify the Circumcision by Faith, and the Uncircumcision through Faith.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 30.</NOTE>
<PB N="62" REF="005697_0064_1026C2302B57B7E8"/>
<HI>Now it was not written for his Sake alone, that it was imputed to him, but for us also to whom it</HI> SHALL <HI>be imputed, if we believe on him.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 23, 24.</NOTE> There are many other Places of Scripture of the like Tendency, the Words of which I have not Time to men∣tion. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 22—28.

<P>It has pleas'd God to employ the Grace of Faith in the Business of Justification ra∣ther than any other Grace; because of its

fitness for this Office: The Eye is employed in seeing, the Ear in hearing, and not the Foot, because of their Fitness for such Functions. Thus seeing we are justified not by giving to God any thing that we do, but by receiving from God what Christ has done for us: Faith being the only receiving Grace, is therefore only fit for this Office, the other Graces have their Exercise and Use in order to Salvation, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xiii. 3.</NOTE> but do nothing towards our puting on the Robe of Christ's Righteousness.

Faith therefore justifies as it unites to Christ, for as our natural Union to the first <HI>Adam</HI> is the Ground of our Condemnation, so our spiritual or mistical Union to the Second, is the Ground of our Justification.</P>
<P>What has been said is Doubtless intend∣ed by the <HI>Westminster</HI> Assembly, when they tell us
<Q>That Faith only receives the Righteousness of <HI>CHRIST.</HI></Q>
<HI>i. e.</HI> In Contradistinction from every other Grace in us, and all the Works of Holiness and Righ∣teousness done by us.</P>
<P>The Representation which the Church of <HI>England</HI> give of Justification in the <HI>eleventh</HI> Article, is exactly agreeable to that of the <HI>Westminster</HI> Assembly, which I have explained and is as follows, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>We are accounted Righteous before God,
<PB N="69" REF="005697_0071_1026C242E1B6A550"/>
only for the Merit of our Lord and Sa∣viour JESUS CHRIST by Faith, and not for our own Works or Deservings. Wherefore that we are justified by Faith only, is a most wholesome Doctrine and very full of Comfort, as more largely is express'd in the Homily of Justification.</Q>
This leads me to the</P>
<P N="2">II. General Head, which was to prove, <HI>that Justification is without the Works of the Law.</HI></P>
<P>Now this is not only expresly asserted in the Words of our Text, but likewise in other Places of Scripture: <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 28. Rom. v. 1. Rom. iii. 20. Gal. iii. 11, 24.</NOTE> To which let me add the following Arguments, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> The Law requires a Perfection of Obedience in order to Justification by it, and denounces a <HI>Curse</HI> upon those that want it. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 10.</NOTE> Now seeing we are destitute of that perfect and inherent Righteousness, in Habit and Act which the Law requires; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 12,—18.</NOTE> it is impossible we should be justified by it; neither will it avail to reply that the aforesaid Perfection was necessary under the
<PB N="70" REF="005697_0072_1026C24467D10610"/>
Law, but not under the Gospel; for the <HI>Relaxation</HI> made under the Gospel is not that an imperfect Righteousness shou'd be accepted for a perfect one; for thus the Justice of God would be wrong'd: Neither is it consistent with the Truth of God to declare those Righteous, that are not per∣fectly so, either <HI>inherently</HI> or by <HI>Imputation.</HI> But the <HI>Relaxation</HI> made under the Gospel, consists in accepting of the Righteousness of the Surety, in the Room of that which the Law required of the Sinner personally.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> We have broken the Law, and cannot make Reparation equal to the Of∣fence, and less than this, divine Justice will not accept. Our after Obedience, upon the Supposition it was perfect, (which in the mean time cannot be reasonably expected from imperfect Creatures) wou'd not make Satisfaction for our past Disobedience; the Reason of which is this: We are under a double Debt to God, <HI>viz.</HI> Of <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Penalty;</HI> as <HI>Creatures,</HI> we owe the former to God's <HI>Law,</HI> and as <HI>Transgressors</HI> we owe the latter to his <HI>Justice;</HI> now the Payment of the one, cannot discharge the other,
<PB N="71" REF="005697_0073_1026C245F35C4CD8"/>
which is of a different Kind. Let me add, that the Penalty threatned, being equal to the Demerit of Sin, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 23.</NOTE> is such as we can't endure without being eternally miser∣able. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Because the Sufferings of a finite Creature, cannot be infinite in Degree or Value, they must be infinite in Duration.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We can't be justify'd by Works, because that Works done before Faith are not pleasing to God, but full of Sin; and so soon as Faith is given, it immediately re∣ceives Christ, and so we are Justified be∣fore we perform Works that are spiritually Good. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 7, 8.</NOTE> And hence the Almighty is said <HI>to Justify the Ungodly:</HI> <NOTE N="††" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 5.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> Such as have never done any acceptable Service to God. The Church of <HI>England</HI> speak ex∣cellently upon this Point, in the 13th Ar∣ticle, which is as follows:
<Q>Works done before the Grace of Christ and the In∣spiration of his Spirit, are not pleasant to God, for as much as they spring not of Faith in Jesus Christ; neither do they make Men meet to receive Grace,
<PB N="72" REF="005697_0074_1026C24B24E9EF98"/>
(or as the School Authors say,) de∣serve Grace of congruity: Yea ra∣ther for that they are not done as God hath willed and commanded them to be done, we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> We cannot be Justified by Works, because then the Reward wou'd be reckon'd of Debt and not of Grace; <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 4.</NOTE> but the Reward is of Grace, and hence the Man is describ'd as <HI>blessed, to whom God im∣puteth Righteousness without Works:</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 6.</NOTE> <HI>And if of Grace, it is no more of Works, other∣wise Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of Works then it is no more Grace: Other∣wise Work is no more Work.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi. 5, 6.</NOTE> To be justi∣fied freely, (which the Word Grace sig∣nifies) without any Regard to our Works, as Causes thereof either in Part or in whole, and to be justify'd partly or wholly by Works, are absolute and unreconcileable Inconsistencies.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly.</HI> Seeing the Righteousness of CHRIST is perfect and of infinite Value,
<PB N="73" REF="005697_0075_1026C24D92E57E70"/>
equal to the Demands of the Law and Justice, as has been before prov'd, then there is no need of adding ours to it with Design to purchase in Part our Justification be∣fore God: And truly this Notion is Inju∣rious to the Honour of CHRIST as Media∣tor, for it interpretatively says, that his Sa∣tisfaction is incompleat; and if the Case were so, surely ours could never compleat it, because it is at least imperfect. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. lxiv. 6.</NOTE> And thus no Flesh could be saved.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. We cannot be justified by Works, because that thus Man would have Cause of boasting, which the Apostle assures us is excluded, <HI>Not by the Law of Works but by the Law of Faith.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 27.</NOTE> It tends to puff up the Pride and Vanity of the Creature to imagine that there is any Merit in his Works. And how unreasonable is the Supposition, that we should merit Good from God by returning to him what is his own?</P>
<P N="7">7thly. It is reasonable to conclude, that we are justifi'd in the same Manner that
<PB N="74" REF="005697_0076_1026C24F16A0FFD0"/>
<HI>Abraham</HI> the Father of the Faithful was. Now this was by Faith, for says the A∣postle, <HI>If</HI> Abraham <HI>were justified by Works, he hath whereof to Glory:</HI> But he denies that he had Cause of glorying before God, and therefore he was not justified by Works, <HI>No he believed God and it was imputed to him for Righteousness.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 2.3.</NOTE> In the mean Time, as the Apostle <HI>James</HI> observes, this Faith of <HI>Abraham</HI> by which he was justified, was a living Operative Principle which evidenc∣ed its Reality by good Works, that flow'd from it as Streams from a Fountain.</P>
<P N="8">8thly. Our Righteousness answers not the Demands of the Gospel no more than of the Law, and so falls short of every Rule of Righteousness. The <HI>Gospel</HI> requires Perfection as well as the Law, to imagine the Contrary is in other Words to say, either that the Imperfections of Believers are no Sins, or that the Gospel allows of Sin, both which are equally absurd.!</P>
<P>It is true the Gospel promises the Par∣don of Imperfections to believers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on the Exercise of Faith and Repentance, which
<PB N="75" REF="005697_0077_1026C250A8B26178"/>
the Law does not, yet in the mean Time it obliges to the Contrary, and therefore cannot accept of that as a Righteousness for Justification, which falls short of its own Demand, unless it be supposed to declare those Righteous which, according to its own Prescriptions, are not so, and this would be to assert what is false in Fact: He that is Imperfect is Guilty, then sure∣ly the <HI>Righteous God will by no means quit such,</HI> except they have another Righteous∣ness than their own to screen them from divine Vengeance.</P>
<P>Surely as the Prophet expresses it, <HI>we are all as an unclean Thing, and all our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Isa. lxiv 6.</NOTE> We have lost our Original Integrity, and in the Room thereof contracted the vilest Polu∣tion and Depravity, which has spread thro' all our Powers, and consequently mingles with and taints every Principle and Spring of Action, and makes them of a base Allay. <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Isa. i. 56.</NOTE> This Sentiment had much Im∣pression upon the Heart of <HI>Job,</HI> as appears by the following strong Lines of his, <HI>If I
<PB N="76" REF="005697_0078_1026C254F45650C0"/>

not.</HI> <NOTE N="‡*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 19.</NOTE> And <HI>James</HI> likewise asserts <HI>that in many Things we offend all.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">James iii. 2.</NOTE> Now how can such a Righteousness answer ei∣ther the Demands of the Law or Gospel?
<Q>A Man (says Bishop <HI>Hopkins</HI>) might more reasonably expect to buy Stars with Counters, or to purchase a Kingdom with two Mites, than to think to pur∣chase the heavenly Kingdom, by paying down his own Duties and good Works which are no Ways profitable to God, and bear no more Proportion to the In∣finite Glory of Heaven than a single Cy∣pher to the numberless Sands of the Sea.</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Page 382.</NOTE></P>
<P>Not to add, that if any Righteousness of ours was the Matter or Cause of our Justification before God, the Covenant of Grace would be unhing'd, and a Covenant of Works put in the Room of it. Pray what was the Reason why the Covenant of Nature was call'd a Covenant of Works? But because Man's Righteousness and O∣bedience was therein to be the Ground and Reason of his Acceptance.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="005697_0080_1026C258E73E8628"/>To assert that there is more Grace in the new Covenant than in the Old, will not alter the Case, so long as the Condition of both is supposed to be the same, be∣cause that more or less in Degree does not alter the Kind. And hence we may con∣clude, that the Notion of Justification by Works, either in whole or in Part, subverts the Gospel of Christ, and pretends to lay another <HI>Foundation</HI> for Mans Happiness than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ; for this supposes that not the pure Grace of God and the Righteousness of Christ, is the Cause why one differs from another as to the State of his Soul, but Mens Virtue and Goodness. The Apostle there∣fore charges those that Preach such Doc∣trine as <HI>perverters</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> of Christ, as <HI>Preachers</HI> of <HI>another Gospel,</HI> and denoun∣ces a Curse upon them in his Epistle to the <HI>Galatians.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. i. 6, 7, 8, 9,</NOTE> And elsewhere he declares, <HI>that</HI> Israel <HI>that followed after the Law of Righteousness, did not attain to the Law of Righteousness,</HI> (and that for this Reason) <HI>because they sought it not by Faith, but as

it were by the Deeds of the Law, i. e.</HI> The Carnal <HI>Jews</HI> sought after Justification, partly on the Account of their own Works, and not as the Free-Gift of God, and therefore did not attain it: <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. ix. 31.32.</NOTE> And in the following Chapter he farther confirms this by saying, that some of the <HI>Jews had a Zeal of God, but not according to Know∣ledge, for they being Ignorant of God's Righteousness, and going about to establish their own, have not submitted themselves to the Righteousness of God,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 2, 3.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> The Graceless <HI>Jews,</HI> not having an affecting Apprehension of the Necessity and Sufficien∣cy of the Righteousness of the Media∣tor to their Justification, which was of God's finding out and Acceptance, but endea∣vouring in the Room thereof to establish their own Virtue or Goodness as a Ground of Pardon, they did not become Subjects to the Mediators Righteousness, but proud∣ly rebell'd against the Way of Salvation by it. This Gloss the Emphasis of the original Word will justify. <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Hupeta∣gesan. See also Gal. ii. 21.—<HI>If Righteousness come by the Law, then Christ is dead in Vain.</HI> And Rom. iv. 14. <HI>For if they which are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made Void, and the Promise made of none Effect. i. e.</HI> If Persons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o in any Degree obtain a Right to Impunity and Life for their Obedience to the Law either Ceremonial or Mo∣ral; then there was no need of Christ's Death to Com∣pass that which might be otherwise adjusted, and so Christ has died in Vain. Neither would there be any need upon such a Plan of going to Christ by Faith for what we are supposed to have in ourselves, or any need of the Promises of Pardon thro' him. What need is there of a Saviour to do that for us which we can do for ourselves, if Men can do a little that shall in any De∣gree recommend them to the Favour of God: By the same Rule, through greater Application, they may do more, and consequently all, and so Christ is rejected and the Foundation of the Gospel overthrown, Faith and the Promises rendered Vain and to no Purpose: Dreadful Thought! This the Apostle farther confirms, <HI>Gal.</HI> v. 4 <HI>Christ is become of no Effect unto</HI> you, <HI>whosoever of you is justified by the Law, ye are fallen from Grace, i. e.</HI> Such as seek Justification by or for their Obedience to the Law do reject Christ and renounce the Grace of God offer'd by the Gospel, Christ's Righteousness is of no avail to them, <HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 6. <HI>And if by Grace it is no more of Works: Otherwise Grace is no more Grace. But if it be of Works then it is no more Grace: Otherwise Work is no more Work, i. e.</HI> The suppos'd Merit of Good Works and the Free-Grace of God cannot be blended toge∣ther as Causes of our effectual Vocation, no in that Sense, they exclude and destroy each other: For what∣soever is of Grace cometh freely and not of Debt, but what cometh by the Merit of Works (or Promise for Works which is the same) cometh by Debt. Now <HI>Debt</HI> and no <HI>Debt,</HI> or what is free and what is by desert, are contrary Things, and therefore Works and Grace can be no more reconcil'd consider'd as Causes of our Justification than Fire and Water, Light and Darkness, Life and Death: Grace must loose its Nature if it be by Works together with it, and Works must loos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Nature if it be by Grace together with them.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="005697_0082_1026C25ED3092370"/>I proceed now to the Improvement, in which I must be but very brief. And</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="005697_0083_1026C26059209A18"/><HI>First:</HI> What has been said serves to re∣fute the false Notions of the <HI>Papists,</HI> who blend Justification and Sanctification toge∣ther; of the <HI>Socinians,</HI> who deny the Sa∣tisfaction of Christ; of the <HI>Arminians,</HI> who deny his Substitution in the Place of Sin∣ners, and mix Works with his Righteous∣ness as the Concause of a Sinners Justifica∣tion before God; of the <HI>Neonomians,</HI> who imagine that a new Law is made which accepts of less than perfect Righteousness, or perfect Satisfaction, for the Sinners Jus∣tification before God; and of the <HI>Antino∣mians,</HI> who imagine that the Elect are justified before Faith, either from Eternity, or at least from the Time of Christ's Death.</P>
<P>Seeing that the Ransom which Christ offered to divine Justice, was not proper Payment in all Circumstances, then it ne∣cessarily follows, that God pardons freely:
<PB N="82" REF="005697_0084_1026C262CFC5F6C0"/>
We are not only beholden to Christ for Satisfying, but to God the Father for Ac∣cepting thereof! <HI>Herein is Love,</HI> without Peer or Parallel!</P>
<P>And it likewise naturally and necessarily follows from the same Principle, that none hath or can have, any actual Interest in, or Benefit by Redemption, 'till they com∣ply with the Terms prescribed by the Fa∣ther and Son, seeing the injured Lawgiver was at liberty to accept of Satisfaction or <HI>not,</HI> he hath of Necessity the Right to pre∣scribe his own Terms, when and how he will admit the Sinner to an actual Claim to the Benefits of it. And surely, the Me∣diator is engag'd with equal Tenderness, to promote the Interests of both Parties, seeing he possess'd the Nature of both, and therefore must needs concur, that the Ap∣plication of his Satisfaction be made in such a way as is consistent with the Honour of God, his Law and Government, which End cannot be attain'd without establishing Faith as the Mean of it, and urging Holi∣ness as the Way to Happiness.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="005697_0085_1026C26457804BE0"/>It is true, a <HI>Surety</HI> in a <HI>strict Sense,</HI> only represents the Debtor and minds his In∣demnity, and when he pays the pecuniary Debt in kind, the Bond is cancell'd.

<P>Our Case God-ward, my Brethren, is not properly that of <HI>Debtors,</HI> but that of <HI>Criminal-Subjects,</HI> and God's Aspect to∣wards us, not <HI>strictly</HI> that of a <HI>Creditor,</HI> but that of a <HI>Rector</HI> and <HI>Judge;</HI> and there∣fore the Part Christ acted, was not in a strict Sense that of a <HI>Surety,</HI> paying the very Debt in Kind, in every Circumstance, and so Discharging the Bond, but that of a <HI>Mediator,</HI> expiating our Guilt by Satis∣faction.</P>

of the <HI>Antinomian Delusion,</HI> con∣cerning eternal Justification. To which I may add, that if the Person must first be charg'd with Guilt before he be Justi∣fy'd, as has been before prov'd, then eternal Justification must fall to the Ground. If it be suppos'd, that Sin is charg'd as well as discharg'd from Eternity; it may be re∣ply'd, that then Men wou'd be con∣demn'd and Justify'd at once, because there is no prior or posterior in Eternity, which is an unreconcileable Contradiction.</P>
<P>The Wit of Man can never reconcile the Notion of <HI>eternal Justification</HI> with the Doctrine <HI>of original Sin,</HI> the <HI>Current</HI> of the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> the <HI>Convictions</HI> of the <HI>Holy Spi∣rit</HI> before Conversion, the <HI>Necessity</HI> of <HI>Faith, Repentance</HI> and <HI>Holiness.</HI> If it be suppos'd that any were Justify'd from Eternity, they have lost it by the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> and so need a new Justification: We have not only the infallible <HI>Testimony</HI> of the <HI>sacred Scriptures</HI> without us, that before Faith we <HI>are Guilty before God,</HI> and <HI>under Condem∣nation;</HI> but such as are convinc'd of Sin, have the <HI>Witness</HI> of <HI>God's Spirit</HI> within

them, to the same Truth: And hence the Spirit of God is call'd, a <HI>Spirit of Bondage to fear.</HI> The Notion of <HI>eternal Justifica∣tion,</HI> destroys the absolute Necessity of <HI>Faith, Repentance</HI> and <HI>Holiness;</HI> for accord∣ing to it, upon the Supposition an Elect Per∣son went on in a Course of the grossest Impieties, such as Murder, Uncleanness and Robbery till Death, and never believ'd or repented, the Almighty wou'd have no more to charge against such a Person, than against the Angels that never sin'd! It tends to make Sin of the most crimson Kind, appear to be but a meer Trifle unworthy of our Fear or Sorrow, and so to banish all Holiness from the Earth, yea and to era∣dicate all Civil Society!</P>

and his Love eternal, and therefore the Elect were Justify'd from Eternity.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I deny the Consequence; tho' God is not Changeable, we are; and there is a manifest Difference between the Pur∣poses of God and the Execution of them: Altho' God did from Eternity purpose to create the World, yet it was not created till Time began; and this being done ac∣cording to God's Purpose, makes no Change in God. As to the Love of God, the usual Distinction of Divines concerning it is just, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Benevolence</HI> and <HI>Complacence;</HI> the former signifies God's gracious Purpose from Eternity, of conferring special Good upon the Elect in Time. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John iii. 16.</NOTE> The latter in∣tends, the actual conferring of the Good design'd, together with the Suitableness of the State and prevailing Temper of the Elect to the approbative Will of God; on which Account he is represented as <HI>taking Delight in them when converted.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Cant. ii. 14.</NOTE> Now it is only in the former Sense that God is said to love the Elect before Conversion. Be∣sides
<PB N="87" REF="005697_0089_1026C26E8332E4B8"/>
it should be considered, that God's Love is no Passion in him, as Love is in us, and therefore only intends the Posture of his Will towards the Object, either in Respect of <HI>Purpose</HI> before Time, or <HI>Approbation</HI> in Time, agreeable to his Purpose before it. Neither is their any Inconsistency in this, that an Elect Person upon whom God intends to confer special Good in Time, should be, in Respect of his present State, expos'd to the Condemnation of the Law before the Good design'd be confer'd; for God's Purpose does not alter the State, till it be put in Execution; and this is what orthodox Divines intend by God's <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Hatred,</HI> respecting the Elect before Conversion.</P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3d. Things to come are present with God, one Day, is with him as a Thou∣sand Years.</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Things to come are not present with God actually, but only in respect of his Knowledge and Purpose respecting their Futurity. If Things to come were actually present with God, then these Absurdities will unavoidably follow, <HI>viz.</HI> That all
<PB N="88" REF="005697_0090_1026C272C102E170"/>
Things are Eternal, and that they are and are not at the same Time and in the same Sense! Besides the same Rule wou'd hold as to Things past, and then we must say concerning the World, that it is still a Creating in the Sight of God, and that the Flood now covers it, and that the People of <HI>Israel</HI> are passing thro' the <HI>Red Sea:</HI> Who sees not that this is rediculous? Surely <HI>Jehovah</HI> looks not on Things in a false Light. What wild Work wou'd it be, if we shou'd form our Prayers according to the aforesaid Scheme? For thus we must now pray for the Protection of <HI>Adam</HI> in Paradise, of <HI>Noah</HI> in the Flood, and of <HI>Lot</HI> in <HI>Sodom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 4th. Justification by Faith, is but a Manifestation of Justification.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> But how can this be? Surely it is not so in Relation to God, for <HI>known to him are all his Works from the Beginning.</HI> And as to others, it is not Faith alone that makes our Justification manifest to them, but principally good Works that flow from it, as the Apostle <HI>James</HI> observes. <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">James ii. 18.</NOTE> Nor can
<PB N="89" REF="005697_0091_1026928C114FDE98"/>
it be justly understood, of the Manifestation of Justification to our selves, for then all that believe would know that they are Justified at all Times, which is contrary to the express Declaration of God's Word, that assures us, that <HI>such as fear God and obey the Voice of his Servant,</HI> do sometimes <HI>walk in Darkness and see no Light.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Again the Scripture excludes our own inherent Righteousness and Works, from any Agen∣cy in that Justification which is by Faith: But to say that all the Graces of the Spirit and Duties of Gospel Obedience, are ex∣cluded from being of any Use in the Ma∣nifestation of our Justification, is to con∣tradict both Scripture and Reason; <HI>hereby,</HI> (says the Apostle <HI>John) we do know that we know him, if we keep his Commandments.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 John <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> To suppose that the Apostle should take so much Pains to state the true Notion of Justification, and to defend it against the carnal <HI>Jews</HI> and false Teachers, and mean no more than a Manifestation which we might be sav'd without, and which is as uncertain as the Wind, is most Ridiculous!</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="005697_0092_1026C2780BA2CA50"/>To certify us of our Good State, is not the Design of the first Act of Faith, but of after Acts; and hence the Apostle ob∣serves concerning the <HI>Ephesians, that after they believed, they were sealed with the Holy Spirit of Promise.</HI></P>
<P>If Faith only gave us the comfortable Knowledge of our State, then it would alter our Frame but not our State; but the Scriptures declare the Contrary, while they inform us, that hereby we obtain <HI>a Right to become the Sons of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 5th. The sacred Scriptures re∣present, <HI>that God was reconciling the World to himself, not imputing their Trespasses to them:</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 19.</NOTE> And that <HI>Christ has made Peace thro' the Blood of his Cross:</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Col. i. 20.</NOTE> And that <HI>the Grace of God in Christ was given us before the World began.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The aforesaid Places of Scripture, can consistently with the Current of Scrip∣ture, the Analogy or <HI>Proportion of Faith,</HI> and Dictates of right Reason, be supposed to mean no more than these Things fol∣lowing:
<PB N="91" REF="005697_0093_1026C27A8134AF70"/>
(1st.) That there was a gracious Purpose of God from Eternity, to vouch∣safe Blessings on the Elect in time. (2dly,) That there was a sufficient Foundation laid in the Covenant of Redemption, as well as in the Sufferings and Obedience of Christ in pursuance of it, for the purchasing and securing the actual Reconciliation of the Elect in time. (3dly,) That there was and is a Sufficiency of Grace treasur'd up in Christ as the Head of his Church and Fountain of Influence, to be communicated to the Elect upon their Closure with him; which in some Places of Scripture, is re∣presented by the <HI>Time past,</HI> to shew the Certainty of the Event: For the same Rea∣son, the Coming of our Lord to Judgment, is represented by the Apostle <HI>John</HI> as <HI>pre∣sent,</HI> tho' it be <HI>future: Behold he cometh with the Clouds!</HI></P>
<P>It's well observ'd by Professor <HI>Haliburton,</HI> <Q>That upon Christ's yielding the Satisfac∣tion demanded, there did result a Right for the Elect, to Freedom from the Curse, and to all the Benefits of his Purchase: This Right is not what the Lawyers call,
<PB N="92" REF="005697_0094_1026C27C0933ED30"/>
<HI>Jus in re,</HI> but <HI>Jus ad rem.</HI> 'Tis more properly said, there is a Right for them, then that they have a Right; since they know not of it, it is not actionable by them, nor is it actually Vested in their Persons, yet with God it is righteous, that they for whom Justice is satisfy'd, a Price paid, Redemption purchas'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> shou'd at the Time and in the Order agreed on, be put in actual Possession of those Privileges.</Q></P>
<P>To say that the Elect are Justified from Eternity, is in effect to say, that nothing sin'd from all Eternity, and that nothing was Justified, which is absurd! For the Elect before they Exist, are nothing in re∣spect of actual Sin.</P>
<P>If it be Objected that what has been said, will oppose the Decrees: I Answer, no not at all! For the Decree considers future Beings and future Actions, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. i. 4.</NOTE> but Justifi∣cation respects Persons present, or existing, and Actions past, and hence God is said, <HI>to Just<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fy the Ungodly.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. iv. 5.</NOTE> But can a Person
<PB N="93" REF="005697_0095_1026C27E8587B9C8"/>
be actually Ungodly before he has a Being? The Almighty decreed from all Eternity to glorify as well as justify the Elect, are they therefore actually Glorify'd from Eternity? If it be said that there was more than a Decree, <HI>viz.</HI> Christ's Engagement as a Surety to redeem the Elect. <HI>Ans.</HI> What then, so there was a Covenant Engagement between the Father and Son, that Christ should be made a Curse for his People in Time: And was he therefore actually made a Curse from all Eternity? No surely!</P>
<P>To assert the Elect are actually justify'd and actually condemn'd at the same Time, is as gross a Contradiction as to say that Light is Darkness, and Darkness is Light, it is impossible in the Nature of Things: Such as are actually justify'd are actually freed from Condemnation, and therefore can't at the same Time be actually under it. But I must conclude these polemical Hints, and proceed to mention a</P>
<P><HI>Second</HI> Infference from what has been before said, and that is <HI>the comfortable State of Believers.</HI> Who these are I have before shewn, by explaining the Nature of Faith,
<PB N="94" REF="005697_0096_1026C28016338090"/>
which I advise the Reader to examine himself by.</P>
<P>Now such as do find in themselves the Characters of Faith have Reason to rejoyce under the most gloomy Aspects of Provi∣dence: For however Men may condemn them God will not, <HI>there is no Condemnati∣on to those that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the Flesh but after the Spirit.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P>And we may likewise learn the Neces∣sity and Excellency of Faith thro' which alone we can be justified, and that the Greatness of Sin is no Bar to believing, seeing the Righteousness of Christ is able to make the most Crimson Sins white as Snow; and that it is freely offer'd to all Believers.</P>
<P>To conclude, justified Persons should be exceeding humble, seeing that <HI>boasting is excluded by the Law of Faith,</HI> and <HI>Holy</HI> also in all Manner of Conversation, evi∣dencing thereby their Justification to the World about them. I conclude in the Words of the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Titus, That being justified by his Grace we should be made
<PB N="95" REF="005697_0097_1026C282B5499618"/>
Heirs, according to the Hope of eternal Life. This is a faithful saying, and these Thngs I will that thou affirm constantly, that they which have believ'd in God, might be care∣ful to maintain good Wooks: These Things are good and profitable unto Men.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tit. iii. 7, 8.</NOTE></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ROMANS III. 31.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? God forbid: Yea we establish the Law.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>A JUST View of the Harmony that subsists between the Law and Gos∣pel, is of great Importance in the Christian Religion: To promote this, is therefore the Design of our present Meditations, to which the Text I have chosen directly leads.</P>
<P>To understand which let it be consi∣dered, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> having in the preceeding Verses of this Chapter, prov'd at large by a Train of close Reason∣ing, that the Justification of a Sinner be∣fore God is by Faith only. Foreseeing that some wou'd be tempted to abuse that pre∣cious Doctrine of Grace to the Contempt of the Law; in order to prevent this vile Abuse, he proleptically States the Objecti∣on of such by way of Query or Interroga∣tion, and rejects it with a vehement Ne∣gation,
<PB N="100" REF="005697_0100_1026C286ACF8A260"/>
or with great abhorrence! <HI>Do we then make void the Law by Faith?</HI> The Objection more fully Stated is this:
<Q>The Apostles by their Doctrine of Justificati∣on by Faith, make the Law unprofitable, useless, vain; they abolish and abrogate it, and destroy all Obligation to obey it.</Q></P>
<P>The Apostle replies with a <HI>God forbid!</HI> As if he should say, I abhor the Thought! That so valuable and excellent a Rule of Life should be made void! O dreadful, detestable Suggestion! This Objection is the same in Substance with the slanderous Report which some spread concerning the Doctrines of Grace, which the Apostles preach'd, affirming that
<Q>they said, let us do Evil that Good may come.</Q>
This Ca∣lumny <HI>Paul</HI> rejects with equal Detestation, in the following Words, <HI>whose Damnation js just:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Verse 8 of Rom. iii. Chap.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> Sayeth <HI>Poole,</HI>
<Q>Their Dam∣nation is just, who teach such Doctrine and Practice accordingly; or they justly deserve Damnation, who calumniate the Apostles and publishers of the Gospel,
<PB N="101" REF="005697_0101_1026C28A15374E10"/>
and raise false Reports and Slanders of them:— Who affirm we say or hold, <HI>that Evil may be done that Good may come thereof.</HI></Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Poole's <HI>Annotations</HI> in Locum.</NOTE> Now seeing the abolishing the Moral Law as a Rule of Action, tends to destroy all Holiness entirely, (as I shall afterwards labour to make evident) it must needs be a great Evil; and if this be done <HI>that Good may come,</HI> it is in Substance what the Apostle rejects with so much Warmth in the preceeding Part of this Chapter!</P>
<P>It is the Moral Law that the Apostle here Discourses of, for in this Chapter he shews that both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> are un∣der Sin by breaking of it: Now the <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> were not under the ceremonial Law, and so could not transgress it, and there∣fore it must needs be the Moral Law that is intended in our Text.</P>
<P>Besides it is certain that the Gospel Dis∣pensation of Faith, does make void the ceremonial Law; when the Substance came the Shadows fled away, the Types must
<PB N="102" REF="005697_0102_1026C28BC02D78A0"/>
needs give Place to the Antitype, that <HI>Hand-writing of Ordinances was nail'd to the Cross of Christ.</HI> But in what Sense does the Apostle oppose making void the Moral Law?</P>
<P>I answer, not as a Covenant of Works; for himself elsewhere shews, that it is in that Respect made void to Believers, and asserts, that <HI>they are not under the Law but under Grace.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 14.</NOTE> Since Man's Apostacy, the Law cannot give Life as a Covenant thro' our Default, forasmuch as it requires a Per∣fection of Obedience to that Purpose, which we have rendered ourselves unable to per∣form. It is therefore the Destruction of the Moral Law as a <HI>Rule</HI> of Life, or its Obligation to Obedience under that Cha∣racter, which the Apostle opposes.</P>
<P>To make this the more easy to be un∣derstood, let it be considered, that a Law in general may be thus describ'd, <HI>viz.</HI> That it is a Rule of Duty, or of Things to be done and avoided, prescrib'd by the Almighty, and enforced by the Threatning of Punishment upon the Transgressor.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="005697_0103_1026C28D6EA79E68"/>Now there are two Kinds of Laws, namely, <HI>positive</HI> and <HI>moral:</HI> The former take their Rise entirely from the Legisla∣tor's Pleasure, and enjoyn Things that are not essentially or intrinsically Good in their own Nature, antecedent to the Command, and are therefore Good only because com∣manded, and Evil because forbid: Of this Kind was the primitive Prohibition, of ab∣staining from the Fruit of a certain Tree, which before, was no doubt, lawful to be eaten: of this Kind was also the ceremo∣nious Observances of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church, and likewise their judicicial or political Laws, at least such of them as were pe∣culiarly adapted to the State of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Nation: These Commands are alterable because they are not grounded on the in∣trinsick Goodness and Reasonableness of Things, but upon the Legislator's Pleasure.</P>
<P>But the latter, <HI>viz. moral</HI> Preceps, have an essential Equity and Reasonableness in them, they conform us to the Attributes and Actions of God, which are the Pa∣tern of our Imitation; they are exactly adapted to the Frame of Man's Faculties,
<PB N="104" REF="005697_0104_1026C2911BA7A6A0"/>
and to his Condition in the World, and serve to maintain the Primitive Dignity of human Nature, and good of Society, and therefore cannot be altered; for the Things are enjoyn'd because they are good, and for∣bidden because they are in themselves Evil.</P>
<P>This Law is call'd <HI>Moral,</HI> to distinguish it from positive and ceremonial Institutions; and likewise the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> because it was at first, as to the Substance of it, made C-onatural to Man, and, as it were, engraven on the human Soul (or Consci∣ence) when it came at first out of the Hands of God. But Man's understanding being darkned, and his Will and Affections being deprav'd by Sin, there was need of a Second Edition of it for our Direction in Practice; which God in infinite Condescention gave in two Tables of Stone upon Mount <HI>Sinai.</HI></P>
<P>This Law does virtually contain in it an Obligation to believe and obey what God should afterwards reveal and enjoin, and therefore all <HI>positive Precepts</HI> of a Divine Original were and are establish'd by the Moral Law, during the Time appointed for their Continuance.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="005697_0105_1026C29398137B90"/>This Law was never given to any since the Fall of Man with Design to obtain Justification before God by Obedience to it, tho' many carnal Persons took it in this Light to their great Prejudice, but <HI>was added</HI> to the Covenant of Grace, <HI>because of Transgressions,</HI> as an Appendix to promote its grand In∣tention by convincing Sinners and direct∣ing Saints, and so it is <HI>not against the Pro∣mises of God</HI> but greatly serves them by making <HI>Offences</HI> to <HI>abound</HI> in the Unrege∣nerate, <HI>i. e.</HI> as to their View of them and by <HI>working Wrath, i. e.</HI> Making them sensible of the Wrath they deserve for Sin, and so disposing them to accept the Redeemer by Faith, and by guiding Be∣lievers in the Paths of Purity, and hum∣bling them for their Defects.</P>
<P>And tho' under the Gospel Dispensati∣on, the Church being come to mature Age, Believers are not under so severe a Discipline as obtain'd during the <HI>Jewish</HI> OEconomy, but are freed entirely from the Bondage of the Ceremonial Severities as well as from so frequent an Inculcation of the Terrors of the Moral Law, attended
<PB N="106" REF="005697_0106_1026C295D06ABE58"/>
with but obscure Discoveries of Gospel Grace, which were necessary to prepare the <HI>Jewish</HI> infant Church to embrace with readiness a brighter and milder Dispensati∣on, and so may be said to be <HI>no longer un∣der the Law as a School-Master;</HI> yet they need it as a Rule of Practice.</P>
<P>Now the moral Law was given to inno∣cent Man, both as a <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Duty</HI> and a <HI>Covenant</HI> of <HI>Life.</HI> Man was not only to be directed by it as a <HI>Rule</HI> enforc'd with a Penalty, but it was given also in the form of a <HI>Covenant,</HI> a promise of Happiness being annex'd to Man's perfect Obedience to it, together with the positive Precept before mentioned.</P>
<P>The Moral Law therefore can be sup∣pos'd to be made void, but in two Re∣spects, <HI>viz.</HI> Either as a <HI>Covenant</HI> or as a <HI>Rule.</HI></P>
<P>Now it cannot be the former Sense that the Apos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> opposes, because he in other Places asserts, that Believers are dead to it in that respect, and therefore it must be the latter, for in no other Lights can the moral Law be considered than these.</P>
<P>The Phrase <HI>make void,</HI> signifies to render
<PB N="107" REF="005697_0107_1026C299CE80C0D8"/>
unprofitable and vain to abolish, antiquate, Abrogate. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Catargumen,</HI> inutilem vel irritum redimus, vel abolemus, antiquamus, abrogamus, via. <HI>Poli. Synop. in Loc.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>The Apostle farther observes, that in∣stead of <HI>making void the Law (i. e.</HI> as a Rule) <HI>by Faith, we establish it.</HI> The Word <HI>establish</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Istomen,</HI> stare faicmus, <HI>i. e.</HI> honorem ei suum defendimus, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulcimus. vide <HI>Poli Synop</HI> in <HI>Locum.</HI></NOTE> signifies to make a Thing stand the more firmly, and maintain its Honour. By <HI>Faith</HI> we are to understand by a Me∣tonimy the Doctrine of Justification by Faith, of which the Apostle had been be∣fore discoursing, or the Gospel Dispensati∣on in general, so that from the Words of our Text we may gather this Position, <HI>viz. That the Doctrine of Justification by Faith or Gospel Dispensation, instead of mak∣ing void the moral Law as a Rule of Life, does farther establish it.</HI></P>
<P>In discoursing upon which I shall,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>Offer some Considerations tending to manifest that the moral Law as a Rule of Life is not, nor cannot be made void.</HI> And</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Shew how it is establish'd by the Doctrine of Justification by Faith, or Gospel
<PB N="108" REF="005697_0108_1026C29C64ADB5A0"/>
Dispensation, and then proceed to the Im∣provement.</HI></P>
<P>To confirm and illustrate the first Head of Discourse, I shall only offer the few fol∣lowing Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st. Man is necessarily under a Law to God, he having received his Being and all his Benefits from him, it is but reasonable that he should return some grateful Ho∣mage for them.</P>
<P>Besides as the infinite Excellency of the Supreme Being deserves religious Reve∣rence, so it is but reasonable that it should be offer'd, and especially by Creatures who had received Power adapted to that De∣sign: But how shall this be acceptably per∣form'd without a Law? Hence we may conclude that the infinitely Wise God, who has made nothing in Vain, has given in∣telligent; Creatures a Rule to direct them in his Service, and this indeed the sacred Scripture assures us of.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. This Law being <HI>Moral,</HI> grounded on the Nature of our Relation to God and one another, must needs be perpetu∣ally binding at least as a <HI>Rule,</HI> because it's

<P>If it be objected that the same Apostle tells us that <HI>the Believer is dead to the Law, by the Body of Christ.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 4.</NOTE> It may be reply'd, That the Apostle speaks not there of the Law as a <HI>Rule of Duty;</HI> for in that Sense he calls it in the same Chapter <HI>Holy, Just</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> but as a <HI>Covenant of Works:</HI> In this Respect all that believe are dead to it, <HI>i. e.</HI> they do not expect Justification on account of their Obedience to its Precepts, <HI>but desire to be found in Christ not having their own Righteousness, which is of the Law, (i. e.</HI> not depending upon it for Acceptance with God) <HI>but that which is through the Faith of Christ, the Righteousness which is of God through Faith.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 9.</NOTE></P>

<P>I answer with Doctor <HI>Witsius,</HI>
<Q>That there are two Things to be considered in the Law of God, since Sin has had it's Entrance in the World, <HI>viz.</HI> A Rule and Direction to Obedience, and a Power of restraining from Disobedi∣ence by Terror and Condemnation: When therefore the Apostle teaches, that <HI>the Law is not laid upon a good Man,</HI> he does not Design that, concerning its first and principal Work which is Essential to it, but concerning the other which is Accidental and came by Sin, from which justified Persons are freed by Christ.</Q>

It is certain that Believers are free thro' Christ from the Condemnation of the Law, and that it's principal Use to them is not to affect their fear by its Threats, but to inform their Judgments and direct their Practice by it's Precepts: They are chief∣ly influenced by the free ingenuous Prin∣ciple of Love that inclines them to obey the Law of Choice, which the unregene∣rate are drove to against their Inclination.

Weakness and Want of <HI>Wisdom.</HI> What is the Law of Nature or the Moral Law? but the Obligation of the rational Creature, to admire, adore, love and obey his Crea∣tor, (and to express this by all those po∣sitive Duties, which God may from Time to Time by his Sovereignty require,) and for the Sake of his Creator, to love his Brother sincerely, perseveringly, effectu∣ally. This Law is so noble and rational, so conducive to promote God manifesta∣tive Glory, as well as our Honour and Be∣nefit, that our Happiness consists in Con∣formity to it; and therefore it contains the highest Reflection upon God's Wisdom and Goodness, to suppose that he would destroy it, or suffer the Honour of so excellent a Rule of Government to be eclips'd! which it certainly wou'd be by a Satisfaction less than the Demerit of Sin. This famous Mr. <HI>How</HI> has well express'd in the following Lines:
<Q>It were mani∣festly more honourable and worthy of God, not to have exacted any Recom∣pence at all, than to have accepted in the Name of a Sacrifice, such as were

unproportionable, and beneath the Value of what was to be remitted and confer'd; for what had been lower, must have been infinitely lower: Let any thing be suppos'd less than God, and it falls immensely short of him; such is the Distance be∣tween created Being and uncreated, that the former is as nothing to the latter; and therefore bring the Honour and Majesty of the Deity to any thing less than equal Value, and you bring it to nothing; and this had been quite to loose the Design of insisting upon a Recompence, it had been to make the Majesty of Heaven cheap, and depreciate the Dignity of the divine Government, instead of rendring it August and Great.</Q>

that the Transgressors might easily escape with Impunity, which tends to destroy all Government!</P>
<P>Nor will the untainted <HI>Holiness</HI> of God endure the Destruction or Disparagement of that Law, which is so bright an Ex∣pression of its Beauty and Purity, the inva∣riable <HI>Rectitude</HI> of the divine Nature, whereby he is infinitely removed from all Moral Evil which is essential to God, and represented in the sacred Volumn as his peculiar Glory, inclines him to hate and therefore to punish Sin, or a Transgression of his Law as its contrary.

<P>To suppose that the Gospel frees us from the Moral Law as a Rule of Life, is to cast a most dishonourable Reflection upon it, and make it unworthy of our Acceptance: For thus it would militate against right Reason, against all the valuable Interests of Society, against our own Honour, Comfort and Happiness, against the Image of God, yea God himself! It is no Liberty, but base Bondage and Slavery, to be depriv'd of the Law as a Rule; the Law of God, is a Law of Liberty, and it is sweet Freedom to obey it from Faith and Love; but it's vile Slavery to serve Sin and run after the Whims of our deceitful Hearts, wild Ima∣ginations, or the Delusions of the <HI>Devil transform'd into an Angel of Light.</HI> Christ has not come to allow a Liberty to Sin, by his Gospel and Grace, but to <HI>destroy the Works of the Devil.</HI> Pious Doctor <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> puts the Request of one who holds the licentious Principle I am opposing into the following Language, which naturally flows from it, and serves

<P N="1"><PB N="124" REF="005697_0124_1026C2C7B7D73250"/>1st. The <HI>Grace</HI> of Faith which is the Instrument of Justification, <HI>establishes</HI> the Moral Law various Ways, <HI>viz.</HI> by its <HI>An∣tecedent, Nature, Concomitants</HI> and <HI>Effects.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Antecedent</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> namely, <HI>Con∣viction</HI> of <HI>Sin, establishes</HI> the <HI>Law;</HI> for by this the Sinner is alarm'd out of his Secu∣rity, and arraign'd before the <HI>Bar</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> and made to confess the Purity of its Precepts, and Equity of its condemna∣tory Sentence, together with his Desert thereof by Sin.

<P>Yea the very <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Faith establishes</HI> the <HI>Law,</HI> for what is this but a <HI>receiving</HI> of CHRIST as a KING and LORD as well as a SAVIOUR, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John i. 12.</NOTE> and this cannot be with∣out consenting to obey that Law which is the Rule of his Government. The <HI>Erand</HI> of Faith to CHRIST is certainly for <HI>Holi∣ness,</HI> as well as <HI>Pardon:</HI> Christ <HI>has come by

Water as well as by Blood</HI> to deliver from the Tyrany of Sin as well as from the Guilt of it, and as such true Faith receives and desires him, and therefore in its Nature it includes a Regard to the Rule of Holiness the Moral Law: And hence the <HI>Psalmist</HI> valu'd it above the <HI>finest Gold, and it was sweeter than Honey to his Taste,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psa. xix. 10.

<P>Again the <HI>Concomitants</HI> of <HI>Faith establish</HI> the <HI>Law:</HI> Faith is but a Branch of the new Creation, the Nature and Genius of which God himself represents by <HI>writing his Law upon the Heart,</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxi. 33.</NOTE> which surely signifies the Infusion of a Holy Principle of Action inclining to honour, love and obey the Moral Law: All the Graces infus'd in Regeneration dispose to <HI>Holiness;</HI> and in∣deed God himself is <HI>glorious in Holiness.</HI>
<PB N="126" REF="005697_0126_1026C2CAFA7AB400"/>

<P>And the <HI>Effects</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> do also <HI>establish</HI> the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> a true justifying Faith <HI>pu∣rifies the Heart, and Works by Love.</HI> Well if it purifies the Heart, it must needs dispose to regard the Rule of Purity, and if it Works by Love to God, it must needs produce a Respect to his Image, which is his holy and righteous Law. Can one sincerely love a Person and slight his Picture that is well drawn? And is not Love the fulfiling of the Law? But one remarkable Effect of Faith, which the Prophet <HI>Zache∣riah</HI> mentions, is to bewail with Bitterness our Breaches of the Law, the Words are these, <HI>And I will pour upon the House of</HI> David, <HI>and upon the Inhabitants of</HI> Jerusa∣lem <HI>the Spirit of Grace and Supplications, and they shall look on me whom they have

Well seeing Faith in a crucified Saviour inclines us to mourn over the Breaches of the Law, it hereby puts great Honour upon it in confessing its Justice, Equity and Obligation. And I cannot but observe likewise under his Head, that the Almighty himself declares, that <HI>his writ∣ing his Law in the Heart is a Blessing of the New Covenant, after those Days saith the Lord I will put my Law in their inward Parts, and write it in their Hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my Peo∣ple.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxi. 33.</NOTE> And elsewhere walking in God's Law and Statutes, is represented as a Pro∣mise of the New Covenant by the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> and <HI>I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my Statutes,

<P>It <HI>establishes</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> by <HI>proposing</HI> a <HI>Righteousness equal</HI> to its <HI>Precepts</HI> and <HI>Pe∣nalties, viz.</HI> The Righteousness of the <HI>Mediator God-Man,</HI> perform'd in our Na∣ture in Obedience to the Law; And hence he is said to <HI>be made of a Woman made under the Law.</HI> Hereby the Law was <HI>magni∣fied</HI> and <HI>made Honourable,</HI> more than it would have been by the perfect Obedience or endless Sufferings of the whole rational Creation; for by this God himself was, as it were, brought to it's <HI>Bar!</HI> Hereby the Equity of the Law's Penalty was so∣lemnly and openly declar'd before Men and Angels: What is the Language of

CHRIST'S Sufferings but that the Violation of God's Law is an infinite Evil? Else why did Jesus endure so much for it, and tread the Wine Press of his Fathers Wrath alone? Sacrifices and Offerings could not a∣vail, nor Ten Thousand Rivers of Oyl, nor the yeilding of our first born as Victims to expiate our Guilt, nothing else than the precious Blood of the Son of God could at one for our Crimson Iniquities in violat∣ing the Divine Law! Well, if the Transgression of the Law be so great an Evil, the Law itself must needs be Holy and Good; and indeed if it were not so the Blessed God would not stand so much upon the Honour of it, as to make his own beloved co-equal Son endure such intollera∣ble Anguish and Agonies to repair it, as the Evangelists represent!

<P>And did not the dear Redeemer exactly <HI>fulfil</HI> it's <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>conform</HI> to its

<HI>Precepts? And has he not</HI> hereby <HI>left us an Example that we should follow his Steps.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Dispensation</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> does likewise <HI>establish</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> by <HI>promising</HI> to <HI>assist us</HI> in <HI>Obedience</HI> to it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxvi. 26.27.</NOTE> When Man had broken the Law, and thereby rendered himself unable to obey it to Perfection, an Aversi∣on against it was contracted, and it's Au∣thority slighted: But Faith by proposing Pardon for Imperfections, and promising Assistance, enlivens our Hope, conciliates our Regard, and procures our Obedience. It is a Soul supporting Promise of the New Covenant that <HI>Sin shall not have Dominion over us.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 14.</NOTE></P>
<P>Again the <HI>Dispensation</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> or Doctrine of free Justification by it, <HI>esta∣blishes</HI> the <HI>Law</HI> in <HI>Point</HI> of <HI>Gratitude.</HI> The pure Grace and Love that God gives his People to partake of by the Gospel, can∣not but powerfully constrain them to inge∣nuous Gratitude to so Blessed a Benefactor! For Love is surely Love's <HI>Load-stone,</HI> the greater the Love is that is expressed towards us, the more by Consequence must our Love
<PB N="132" REF="005697_0132_1026C2E18B685D48"/>
be inflam'd by it. Now <HI>Love</HI> being the great Source of acceptable Service, the grea∣ter the Cause the more noble and abound∣ing will be the Effects! Surely the Lan∣guage of the Soul on this Occasion, must be like that of the Psalmist, <HI>What shall I render to the Lord for all his Benefits to∣wards me?</HI> Being redeem'd by so great a Price, Gratitude must constrain them to glorify God by their Bodies and Spirits which are his. But how can this be done without Obedience to his Law, and avoid∣ing all that is contrary to it? Surely the dying Love of Christ for the Sins of his People, and the Consideration of their Bodies being Members of Christ, and Tem∣ples of the Holy Ghost, are powerful Ar∣guments to detest and avoid Sin, and a∣bound in the Duties of Holy Obedience, and these are suggested by the Law of Faith.</P>
<P>Faith, by opening to our View at once the unsearchable Riches of Divine Love, and the dreadful Glories of Divine Justice in the Redeemer's Death, tends to in∣cite our Love and alarm our Fear; and by both, to procure our Obedience to
<PB N="133" REF="005697_0133_1026C2E3110EB300"/>
God's Law and Reverence of his Majesty! And it likewise raises our Hope by assuring us <HI>that we shall reap if we faint not</HI> in our Religious Diligence.</P>
<P>Let what has been said, my dear Bre∣thren, excite you to esteem and value God's Holy Law in your Judgments, and to conform thereto in your Practice, but in the mean Time beware of depending up∣on your Obedience for Acceptance. La∣bour with that Earnestness and Steadiness as tho' you could gain Heaven by your Works, and after ye have done all ye can, depend no more upon them than if ye did nothing. On the one Hand, let us avoid the Error of the <HI>Arminians</HI> and <HI>Pa∣pists</HI> who depend upon their Works: And on the other, let us with equal Care avoid the <HI>Antinomian</HI> Sloth and Negligence, let us walk in the middle Way between these two Extreams. <HI>May</HI> GOD bless <HI>his Word: I add no more at present.</HI></P>

Law <HI>in sacred Scripture,</HI> and then offer some Improvement from the whole.</P>
<P>But before I insist upon the Method propos'd, I shall beg leave to premise a few Words concerning the various <HI>Ac∣ceptations</HI> of the Word LAW. The <HI>Latin Word</HI> for it, is deriv'd from Participles that signify <HI>reading</HI> and <HI>binding,</HI> because Laws were wrote to be read by all, and have a binding or obligatory Power: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lex vel a Legendo ut isido: vel a Ligando ut <HI>Thomas</HI> quasi vinculo ad obedientiam ligant.</NOTE> And hence they are frequently compar'd in Scrip∣ture to <HI>Bands;</HI> thus the <HI>Psalmist</HI> represents the Wicked, as setting themselves in Op∣position to and conspiring against the LORD and his anointed, saying <HI>let us break their</HI> Bands <HI>asunder and cast their Cords from us.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psa. ii.</NOTE> These <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Belial</HI> would not be subject to CHRIST as a KING, but base∣ly renounc'd Allegience to his Govern∣ment; they <HI>would not have this Man to rule over them;</HI> they were impatient of restraint, and would not come under the Obligation of his <HI>Laws</HI> and conform them∣selves to their Direction; they judg'd them

<P>Sometimes it is taken <HI>strictly</HI> for the <HI>mosa∣ick Dispensation,</HI> as oppos'd to the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> in which Sense these Words of <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> are to be under∣stood,
<PB N="138" REF="005697_0138_1026C2F0ED2582A8"/>
<HI>for the Priesthood being changed, there is made of Necessity a Change also of the Law,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. 12.</NOTE><HI>a Disanulling of the Commandment going before, for the Weakness and unprofitableness thereof.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heb. vii. 18.</NOTE> The Weakness and unprofitableness of the <HI>mosaick</HI> Dispensation to many, arose chiefly from their Abuse of it, in expecting Pardon and Sanctification by it, without mind∣ing the Promise, which preceeded it Four hundred &amp; thirty Years, to which it should have led them: They depended on their outward Obedience, and slighted Christ and his Sacrifice, which prov'd fatal to them. The following Words of <HI>John</HI> the Evan∣gelist are to be taken in the same Sense, for <HI>the Law was given by</HI> Moses, <HI>but Grace and Truth came by</HI> Jesus Christ: <HI>i. e.</HI> Thro' <HI>Moses</HI> as God's Minister and Servant, a more <HI>obscure</HI> and <HI>terrible Dispensation</HI> was introduc'd, which many abus'd in the Manner before represented to their Ruin. But Jesus Christ has brought in by the Gospel, a brighter and more comfortable Dispensation, which hath <HI>a Glory that ex∣celleth;</HI>
<PB N="139" REF="005697_0139_1026C2F2A1DBE090"/>
it is attended with <HI>clearer Light,</HI> and for the general, with <HI>larger Distribu∣tions</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Comfort,</HI> than the legal Dispensation. Sometimes the Word <HI>Law</HI> is taken <HI>strictly,</HI> for the Covenant of Works precisely, as contradistinguish'd from the Covenant of Grace; in which Sense the Apostle to the Romans says, <HI>that Believers are not under the Law but under Grace.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 14</NOTE> But more generally it signifies the Ten Com∣mandments; and this is undoubtedly the Sense of it in our Text as has been before prov'd.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Dignity</HI> of the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> ap∣pears from the following Considerations, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First:</HI> Almighty God put Honour upon it, in the <HI>Manner of its Promulgation;</HI> it was given forth with the most awful Solemnity, and Ensigns of commanding Majesty, that thereby Reverence and Obedience might be procur'd to it. The great <HI>God</HI> himself <HI>spoke all the Words</HI> of the Moral Law, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Exod. xx. 1.</NOTE> and at the Time of the giving of it Jehovah de∣scended in visible Glory from the Mansions of Light, the <HI>Seat</HI> of his special Residence upon <HI>Sinai</HI>'s Mount; which the <HI>Psalmist</HI>
<PB N="140" REF="005697_0140_1026C2F4F5255CA8"/>
represents with great beauty and grandeur of Diction; <HI>He bowed the Heavens and came down, he rode upon the Cherubims, and did fly upon the Wings of the Wind, he made Darkness his Pavilion round about him, at his Presence the Earth shook, and the Foun∣dations of the Hills were moved,</HI> and parti∣cularly (as it were for fear of the descend∣ing God) Sinai <HI>trembled,</HI> and was wrap'd in Fire and Smoke! <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Psalm xviii.</NOTE></P>
<P>The Terrors of that Day were likewise encreas'd, by the loud and long Blasts of a Trumpet, by successive Peals of Thunder and Flashes of Lightning, which opened a most tremendous Scene!</P>
<P>To what has been said we may add, the divine Injunction, that the People must prepare themselves to hear the LAW; they were to <HI>sanctify themselves and wash their Cloaths:</HI> Now tho' this was a cere∣monious Usage peculiar to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Oe∣conomy, yet doubtless the Sanctification of the Heart was thereby signified. They were also to abstain from conjugal Liber∣ties,
<PB N="141" REF="005697_0141_1026C2FE5EF5DB88"/>
that they might attend on the Hearing of the Law with greater Solemnity!</P>
<P>And <HI>Bounds were set to the Mount that none might touch it,</HI> in order to create a Reverence of that Law that was then to be proclaim'd! <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ex. xix. 9. to the 22. Verse.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Secondly:</HI> Another Instance of Honour put upon the Moral Law, was the <HI>writing of it upon Tables of Stone by the Finger of God:</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ex. xxxi. 18.</NOTE> By which we are doubtless to understand his Power and immediate Operation: This was surely design'd to represent in a fami∣liar Manner, the eminent <HI>Dignity</HI> and per∣petual <HI>Duration</HI> of the <HI>Moral Law.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly:</HI> Jehovah's <HI>repairing</HI> the <HI>Tables</HI> after they were broken, is an additional Argument for the <HI>Dignity</HI> of the <HI>Law:</HI> Jehovah <HI>commanded</HI> Moses <HI>to hew two Tables of Stone like unto the First,</HI> and promis'd <HI>that he wou'd write upon them the Words which were in the first Tables, that</HI> Moses <HI>broke:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ex. xxxiv. 1.</NOTE> Here it is evident, that the writ∣ing upon the second Tables, was done im∣mediately by God himself, like that of the First.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="005697_0142_1026C2FFE7404F30"/><HI>Fourthly:</HI> The <HI>Shine upon the Face of</HI> Moses <HI>was so great, that the</HI> Israelites <HI>could not stedfastly behold him without a Vail.</HI> This the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> applies to the Mi∣nistration of the Law, in his Epistle to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii.</NOTE> and acknowledges that it had a great deal of Glory in it, <HI>but such as was to vanish;</HI> not that the Law it self was to vanish, no by no Means! but only that particular Dispensation of it of which he speaks, which was attended with many Ceremonies and Types, that when the Antitype came, of their accord evanished.</P>
<P>When the Apostle calls the <HI>Law,</HI> a <HI>killing Letter,</HI> a <HI>Ministration</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Condemnation;</HI> he speaks of it only
<Q>as separate from, and set in Opposition to the Gospel, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii.</NOTE> which it never was (says excellent Mr. <HI>Flavel</HI>) since the Fall, but by the Ignorance and Infidelity of unre∣generate Men.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Vindix</HI> p. 664.</NOTE> Again</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly:</HI> The <HI>Preservation of the Law in the Ark,</HI> and that by vertue of the Or∣der of God, is another Evidence of its
<PB N="143" REF="005697_0143_1026C3018813AC38"/>
<HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Excellency:</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">1 Kings viii. 9.</NOTE> To which might be added, the Time of <HI>Moses's</HI> being on the Mount at the giving of it, and his Preservation for the Space of Forty Days, without Meat or Drink, which doubtless was a Miracle wrought in Honour of the Law of God. But I proceed to the</P>
<P N="2">II. Propos'd, which was to shew <HI>the Excellency of the</HI> Moral Law, <HI>from the Characters or Properties ascrib'd to it in the divine Word.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Moral Law has the following Characters in Scripture, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> It is call'd the <HI>Royal Law,</HI> to sig∣nify that it is enjoyn'd by the Authority of God as a King; and if so, then it must needs be an Instance of <HI>Loyalty</HI> to obey it, and of <HI>Rebellion</HI> against the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>Lord</HI> of all, to disclaim and reject it. The royal Law is the King's Law: <HI>i. e.</HI>
<Q>The great Law, which is the same to all rich and poor, the common Rule by which all are to act, as the King's Way: <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Numb. xxi. 22.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> the great, plain Way, in which all are
<PB N="144" REF="005697_0144_1026C3048F1B2830"/>
to travel.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pool's <HI>Annot.</HI></NOTE> This Sense of the Words the Apostle <HI>James</HI> confirms, by saying in the same Verse, <HI>if ye fulfill the Royal Law according to the Scriptures, ye do well:</HI> Now that he means the Moral Law, ap∣pears plainly from what is express'd in the same Text, <HI>thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jam. ii. 8.</NOTE> The Word <HI>fulfil,</HI> or as the Original may be rendred, <HI>perfect,</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Teleite.</NOTE> con∣sidered in connexion with the preceeding and following Verses, can intend no more than a sincere Endeavour to keep all the Precepts of the Law impartially, which he opposes to their Partiality in the Law, by respecting some Precepts and neglecting others.</P>
<P>This <HI>Law</HI> is full of <HI>royal Majesty,</HI> both on the Account of the <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>Matter</HI> of it; it is enjoyn'd by the <HI>King of Kings and Lord of Lords,</HI> who has Power to bind and loose the Consciences of Men, and is only <HI>able to save and destroy;</HI> and the <HI>Equity</HI> of its <HI>Matter,</HI> does likewise esta∣blish its universal and unceasing Empire,
<PB N="145" REF="005697_0145_1026C3091194EA60"/>
and venerable Majesty; and hence it is the same with the <HI>Law of Nature,</HI> from which, as a Fountain, all other good Laws do spring, to every of which it is superior and by which they are all judg'd, but it is judg'd by none!</P>
<P><HI>Secondly:</HI> Its a <HI>spiritual Law: We know</HI> says the Apostle <HI>Paul, that the Law is spi∣ritual,</HI> we know it both b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Inspiration and Experience; the Law is spiritual in respect of its <HI>Author, Extent</HI> and <HI>Tendency,</HI> God who is a Spirit has formed it, and made it extend to the Spirit or Soul of Man; it not only regulates our overt Ac∣tions, but prescribes Bounds to our Thoughts and Desires, as appears from our Lord's Explication of it. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Matt. v. 28.</NOTE> It requires spiritual Duties, such as pure <HI>Love</HI> to the blessed God, <HI>Faith</HI> in his Word, and a <HI>Reverence</HI> of his Majesty, as well as <HI>outward Acts</HI> of Obedience from spiritual <HI>Principles,</HI> and therefore it tends to make those that are subject to it, spiritual in the Frame of their Minds, and so con∣form them to that God who is a Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="005697_0146_1026C30C09AA1F00"/><HI>Thirdly:</HI> It is a <HI>holy Law; the Law is holy, and the Commandment holy:</HI> <NOTE N="‡‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 12.</NOTE> The Law is not only holy in respect of its <HI>Au∣thor,</HI> but likewise in regard of its <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Effects;</HI> it proceeds from a holy God, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>joyns universal and persevering Ho∣liness upon the Creature; it is holy in all its Branches, and especially in its <HI>Precepts,</HI> which recommend nothing but what is pure and holy, and agreeable to the divine Will; and hence the <HI>Psalmist</HI> assures us, that <HI>the Commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightning the Eyes:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xix. 8.</NOTE> Particularly the the Law is holy in respect of the Duties towards God which it enjoyns, such as a Dedication of our selves and our all to God's Glory and Service, with <HI>Trust, Reverence</HI> and <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>It is a <HI>christal Image</HI> of the <HI>blessed God,</HI> in it, as in a <HI>Glass,</HI> we may behold a bright, a beauteous <HI>Emblem</HI> of his <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Pu∣rity;</HI> and indeed the Design of the Law is to conform us thereto, and of this, thro' the holy Spirit's Influence, it is a happy
<PB N="147" REF="005697_0147_1026C30DAB552F78"/>
Instrument; and hence is the following <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pression of the <HI>Psalmist, thy Word is very pure, therefore thy Servant loveth it:</HI> And elsewhere, <HI>the Words of the Lord are pure Words, as Silver try'd in a Furnace of Earth, purified seven Times.</HI> The whole Word of God, and especially his <HI>Law,</HI> is perfectly <HI>Pure</HI> and inexpressibly <HI>Precious!</HI></P>
<P N="4">4thly. It is a <HI>Just Law.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 12.</NOTE> This is especi∣ally applicable to the second Table of it, the Precepts of which require the strictest Justice and Equity in our Dealings with Men, and forbid the Contrary, they require <HI>that we should do to others what we would they should do unto us. This,</HI> says our Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>is the Law and the Prophets,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Substance of the second Table o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Law, according to the Explication thereof by the Prophets: The Law is just and reasonable, grounded upon the plainest Maxims of natural Equity and Right; agreeable hereto is that beautiful Expression of the Psalmist, <HI>the Statutes of the Lord are Right, rejoycing the Heart.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psa. xix. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P N="5">5thly. It is a <HI>good Law.</HI> This the A∣postle
<PB N="148" REF="005697_0148_1026C30F5EBC7FF0"/>
<HI>Paul</HI> asserts, not only in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 12.</NOTE> but likewise to <HI>Timo∣thy,</HI> in these Words, <HI>knowing the Law is good, if a Man use it lawfully.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 8.</NOTE> The moral Law is always good <HI>absolutely,</HI> or in it self considered, because it is the Image of the Divine Excellency, and grounded upon the invariable Nature, Reason and Relation of Things; neither does the abuse thereof any more affect or alter it in this Sense, than the abuse of Christ or the Doctrines of Grace alter them.</P>
<P>But the Law is only good <HI>relatively,</HI> or in respect of us when we use it agreeable to its <HI>Design:</HI> The Apostle confirms his Po∣sition respecting the Goodness of the Law by his own and others Experience. <HI>We know, i. e.</HI> we Apostles, we Christians know by Experience, <HI>that the Law is Good,</HI> it has had good Effects upon us.
<Q>It works Goodness, (<HI>sayeth Mr.</HI> Pool) in the observer of it, and is conducive to his temporal and eternal Good.</Q></P>
<P>Not only the <HI>Author</HI> of the Law is <HI>Good,</HI>
<PB N="149" REF="005697_0149_1026C313EA2CEFA0"/>
incomprehensibly and inexpressibly Good, essentially and communicatively Good; <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxix. 68.</NOTE> but the <HI>Matter</HI> thereof is good also. What can be more rational than the <HI>Fear</HI> of God, <HI>Faith</HI> in him, and <HI>Love</HI> to him, and <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Homage</HI> and <HI>Worship</HI> flowing from such noble Principles which are recommended by the first Table of the Law? And what can be more rational in itself, and ne∣cessary for us, (in its Place) than the Du∣ties of <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> recommended by the second?</P>
<P>Things that are meerly <HI>positive,</HI> are Good because they are commanded, and therefore alterable; but Things that are <HI>Moral</HI> are commanded because they are <HI>intrinsically Good,</HI> and agreeable to that eternal Justice and Goodness that are in God himself: And hence it necessarily follows, that to suppose that God may command contrary Things (in a moral Sense) is to suppose that God may contradict his own Nature and so deny himself, which is Blasphemous?</P>
<P>And indeed the Contrary of the Moral
<PB N="150" REF="005697_0150_1026C315769C7800"/>
Precepts, does not only destroy all Religion, but likewise civil Society at a Stroke!</P>
<P>Neither did the Command of God to <HI>Abraham</HI> to slay his Son, and to the <HI>Isra∣elites</HI> to borrow Jewels of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> contradict the Precepts of the Moral Law: For in the former Instance the Sovereign Lord of Life and Death did but give Au∣thority to <HI>Abraham</HI> to take away a Life which he was the sole Author of, and therefore could remove when he pleas'd; but <HI>Murder</HI> is the taking away of a Life without just Authority. And in the lat∣ter Instance, the Almighty, who made all Things, and is consequently absolute Ow∣ner of them, did but transfer the civil dependant Right of the <HI>Egyptians</HI> to the <HI>Israelites;</HI> and this indeed was but a just Compensation for their hard Services. <HI>May not the Lord do with his own what he pleases?</HI> But Theft is the taking away what belongs to another without just Authority or Right.</P>
<P>And it may be farther observ'd, that the <HI>Egyptions</HI> gave their Vessels freely to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> neither did they ask them again
<PB N="151" REF="005697_0151_1026C3174644EF48"/>
when they left that Part of the World but drove them away with the Vessels in haste; neither was the other Precept to <HI>Abraham absolute,</HI> but only a Command of Tryal.</P>
<P>But to proceed. The <HI>Matter</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> is <HI>Good,</HI> not only in respect of it's <HI>Precepts</HI> but <HI>Sanctions.</HI> It is accompany'd with Promises both of spiritual and temporal Good, as appears from the second and fourth Commands: It was therefore wicked in the <HI>heretical Manichees</HI> (who infested the Church about the fourth Century, whom blessed <HI>Augustine</HI> faithfully oppos'd) to say that the Law was only Carnal, and had only carnal Promises; whereas it is certain that the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church had for Substance the same Faith, which we now, thro' divine Goodness, enjoy. And the <HI>Threatnings</HI> annex'd to the Moral Law are Just, and therefore Good.</P>
<P>Again, the <HI>Law</HI> is <HI>Good</HI> in regard of it's <HI>Use.</HI> Now the <HI>Use</HI> of the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> is either <HI>general</HI> to all Men or <HI>particular</HI> to some. And,</P>
<P N="1">1st. <Q>The Moral Law is of Use to all Men, (<HI>say the</HI> Westminster <HI>Assembly in the
<PB N="152" REF="005697_0152_1026C31F4AA8DDD8"/>
larger Catechism</HI>) to inform them of the holy Nature and Will of God, and of their Duty, binding them to walk accordingly; to convince them of their Disability to keep it, and of the sinful Polution of their Nature, Hearts and Lives; to humble them in Sense of their Sin and Misery, and thereby help them to a clear Sight of the need they have of Christ, and of the Perfection of his O∣bedience.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Moral Law</HI> is a Declaration of God's Will to Mankind, respecting their Duty to him and each other, obliging them to personal, perfect and perpetual Obedi∣ence.</P>
<P>As we are <HI>Creatures</HI> we are <HI>Subjects,</HI> he who gave us Being has a Right to demand Obedience from us, to what he prescribes.</P>
<P>And tho' we have made ourselves un∣able to perform perfect personal O∣bedience to the Law, yet God's Right to it remains firm; our Sin cannot lessen that: And tho' Provision is made through Christ for the Justification of our Persons upon believing, and the Acceptance of our sin∣cere,
<PB N="153" REF="005697_0153_1026C320D169C380"/>
tho' imperfect, Services thro' him; yet are we bound by the Law as a Rule to seek after a Perfection of Holiness in our own Persons, and to lament from Love our Defects. The Design of Christ's coming into the World was to strengthen the Obligation of the Law as a Rule, by Arguments of Ingenuity and Gratitude in∣stead of dissolving it. Here observe,</P>
<P N="1">1st. That the <HI>Law informs</HI> all Men of the Holy <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>God</HI> and their <HI>Duty</HI> to him: The divine <HI>Perfections</HI> are impress'd on the <HI>Moral Law</HI> in large, legible and in∣delible <HI>Characters;</HI> his <HI>Sovereignty</HI> in de∣manding Obedience; his <HI>Wisdom, Holiness</HI> and Righteousness in the Nature of the Du∣ties requir'd, which are reasonable, pure, equal, and his <HI>Goodness</HI> in their Use and Bene∣fits to us: What is the Language of the Law, but <HI>Holiness</HI> towards God and <HI>Righteousness</HI> towards Man?</P>
<P N="2">2dly. The Moral Law binds the Con∣sciences of all Men to Obedience, so that none have Reason presumptuously to con∣clude to their Ruin, <HI>We may live as we list, and who is Lord over us?</HI> And indeed
<PB N="154" REF="005697_0154_1026C32257A87138"/>
the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> of God shine with equal Glory and Lustre in continuing our Obligation to Obedience as the Way to future Blessedness: This Method tends to prevent the pregnant Woe and Ruin which would ensue the Withdraw of our Al∣legiance from our Creator and Sovereign Lord.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The <HI>Moral Law</HI> being <HI>spiritual, pure, perfect,</HI> the exact Model and in∣flexible Standard of Integrity has a noble Tendency to shew us that we are <HI>carnal, impure</HI> and <HI>imperfect.</HI> When this <HI>Law</HI> by the Spirit's Influence <HI>enters</HI> into the Soul and Conscience, <HI>then does Sin abound</HI> in our View, in respect of its Number, Aggrava∣tions and Demerit; and thus we are con∣vinc'd of our Inability to fulfil it, and humbled under a Sense of Sin and Misery, as well as thereby induc'd to behold our absolute Need of a Redeemer's Obedience together with the Perfection of it, to an∣swer the Law's Demands.</P>
<P>But the particular Use of the Moral Law either respects the Unregenerate or Regenerate. Now,</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="005697_0155_1026C32737A43F58"/>In respect of the <HI>Unregenerate</HI> the Law hath a five-fold Use,</P>
<P N="1">(1st) To <HI>convince them of Sin:</HI> And hence the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> says, <HI>he had not known Lust, except the Law had said thou shalt not covet. What shall we say then? Is the Law Sin? God forbid! Nay, I had not known Sin but by the Law.</HI> The A∣postle rejects this Inference with Abhorrence, <HI>viz.</HI> Because that Sin sometimes takes Oc∣casion to rage the more, because of the Law's Restraints; that therefore the Law it∣self is Sin, <HI>God forbid!</HI> says he: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 7.</NOTE> When the Sun shines upon the Dunghil it sends forth a more noisom Smell, of which its pure Beams are not the Cause, but Occa∣sion only. The Apostle farther informs us, <HI>that he was alive without the Law once, but when the Commandment came, Sin re∣viv'd and he died:</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 9.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> Before the Law of God was brought home with Power to his Conscience, he had a false Peace and a false Hope; but so soon as the Law came in its Spirituality and Power, he lost

them, and saw he was a dead Man; and elsewere we are told, <HI>that by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 20.</NOTE>—It's true the Holy Spirit is the efficient Cause of Con∣viction, but the Law is the Instrumental.</P>
<P N="2">(2dly.) The <HI>Law</HI> is of excellent Use to <HI>condemn for Sin.</HI> And hence the Apo∣stle informs us in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans, That what Things soever the Law sayeth, it sayeth to them who are under the Law: That every Mouth may be stopped, and all the World may became Guilty before God.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 19.</NOTE> The Condemnations of the Law shut the Sinners Mouth, and silence his Self-righteous Pleas.</P>
<P N="3">(3dly.) The <HI>Law</HI> is <HI>good</HI> to <HI>restrain from Sin;</HI> and hence it is said, to <HI>be added because of Transgression.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 19.</NOTE> The Law is added as it were, as an Appendix to the Covenant of Grace, to promote the great Design of it, by convincing of, and restraining from Transgression! The Terrors with which t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Law is arm'd, tend to deter the Unrege∣nerate from those Impieties which otherwise
<PB N="157" REF="005697_0157_1026C32C11F22590"/>
they would commit: Indeed without this, human Society could not well subsist, how∣ever pious Souls are influenced chiefly by nobler Motives. <HI>Self</HI> is the main Spring of the Actions of the Unregenerate, and on this Account the Threatnings of the Law are <HI>peculiarly</HI> adapted to influence their <HI>Fear;</HI> and this seems to be the Apostle's Scope, when he says, <HI>that the Law is not made for a righteous Man, but for the Un∣godly, and Sinners, Unholy and Prophane.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">(4thly.) The <HI>Law</HI> is of excellent <HI>Use</HI> to <HI>drive Sinners</HI> to <HI>Christ</HI> for Shelter and Safe∣ty, thro' a Sight and Sense of their Un∣donness, and Helplesness without him. To this Purpose the Apostle speak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in his Epis∣tle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> in the following Words: <HI>Wherefore the Law was our Schoolmaster, to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justify'd by Faith.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 24.</NOTE> The Law as a Schoolmaster, scourges rebellious Sinners out of their Security and Sloth, and makes them flee for Refuge to the Hope set before them, as the Avenger of Blood did the
<PB N="158" REF="005697_0158_1026C32EEDFD2D98"/>
Manslayers of old, to the City of Refuge appointed for their Reception. The Law by opening the Sinner's deadly Wounds, compels him to seek in haste and earnest the Balm of <HI>Gilead,</HI> and the Physician that is there; till this, Christ is neglected, for <HI>the Whole need no Physician, but the Sick;</HI> and hence the Apostles us'd alarming Me∣thods in their Sermons, in order to rouze a secure World, and constrain them to fly as for their Lives, from future Wrath to Christ; <HI>Knowing the Terrors of the Lord</HI> (says blessed <HI>Paul) we perswade Men. Christ</HI> is therefore said to be <HI>the End of the Law,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. x. 4.</NOTE> which respects not only his Fulfilment of its Demands, by his active and passive Obedience, but also signifies that he is pointed to by i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, as it is added to the Co∣venant of Grace. It Storms the Sinner out of his false Refuges, and <HI>shuts</HI> him up to Christ as the only <HI>Door of Hope,</HI> in whom we may obtain the <HI>Righteousness of the Law.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 4. <HI>Dicaioma <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mu.</HI></NOTE> To the same Purpose, these Words of the Apostle to the <HI>Galatians</HI> are
<PB N="159" REF="005697_0159_1026C330B9B44720"/>
very full and conclusive; <HI>For I through the Law am dead to the Law, that I might live unto God: i. e.</HI> I through the Law as an Instrument, am become dead to all Obedience to the Law as a Covenant; or in other Words, through the Application of the Law to my Conscience by the holy Spirit, I am drove from all Expectation of Justification by Obedience to it, and this every Man must feel or Experience, before he lives to God's Glory as his highest End; without which <HI>single Eye,</HI> as our Saviour expresses it, we are <HI>in Darkness,</HI> and all our sacred Service is unacceptable, because it issues chiefly from a selfish, Principle.</P>
<P N="5">(5thly.) The Law of God is also a <HI>Mean</HI> of <HI>Conversion</HI> to him: This is expresly asserted by the <HI>Psalmist</HI> in the following Words; <HI>The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the Soul.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Psalm xix. 7.</NOTE> If it be said, that the Law in the aforesaid Scripture, is to be tak∣en in a large Sense: I answer, what then, it does not weaken the Argument, except it be taken in such a Sense as to exclude
<PB N="170" REF="005697_0160_1026C3377B99B4A8"/>
the Moral Law, which cannot be prov'd,: It is absurd to suppose, that the <HI>Psalmist</HI> under the Term <HI>Law,</HI> should recommend all the Word of God, except that of which he spoke expresly; especially considering that the Moral Law, together with its Ex∣plication, was the chief Part of the Scrip∣tures at that Time.</P>
<P>Nor is it reasonable to imagine, that our Lord in his first Sermon, wou'd have used a Method which had no direct Tendency to convert his Hearers. Now we are sure that that Sermon was spent in opening the Law, in freeing it from the false Glosses of the Pharisees, and in urging the Duties of it. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. v.</NOTE></P>
<P>Why should that Influence and Effect, be deny'd to any Part of the Word which the Spirit of God ascribes to the Whole? All Scripture is said to be <HI>profitable for Doc∣trine for Reproof, for Correction, for Instructi∣on in Righteousness, that the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished into all good Works.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Tim. i.i. 16, 17.</NOTE> Now seeing every Part of the
<PB N="161" REF="005697_0161_1026C33903F7EA38"/>
Scripture hath its partial Fitness to produce the aforesaid Effects, why shou'd any Part be rejected? Is not the Word in general compar'd, <HI>to Seed sown that bringeth forth Fruit.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. xiii.</NOTE></P>
<P>Neither <HI>Law</HI> or <HI>Gospel</HI> have any <HI>physical</HI> or inherent <HI>Vertue</HI> in them, to convert Men to God; for then Persons wou'd be always converted at the Hearing of them, which we know is not fact. Take the Gospel as well as the Law without the Spirit, and it is, as to Influence, but a <HI>dead Letter.</HI> The Word of God concurs to Conversion only <HI>objectively</HI> and <HI>morally.</HI> As an Object it presents Truths to the Mind, directs, in∣forms and perswades, in a moral or rati∣onal Way, but has no abiding, efficacious Influence without the Spirit's Concurrence; in that Respect it is like the <HI>Pool</HI> of <HI>Bethes∣da,</HI> whose Waters had no healing Influ∣ence, but at such Seasons when an Angel descended and troubled them.</P>
<P>Now seeing the <HI>Law</HI> hath that <HI>objec∣tively</HI> in it, which may work exceedingly
<PB N="162" REF="005697_0162_1026C33AC3C0EC18"/>
upon the Heart when accompanied with the Spirit's Influence, then why may it not be used <HI>instrumentally,</HI> as well as the <HI>Gospel</HI> in the Conversion of Sinners? When that pure <HI>Glass</HI> is opened in its spiritual Ex∣tent and divine Excellency, by which it resembles the Nature of God himself, why may not the blessed Spirit accompany it, to enflame the Heart with love to the Au∣thor of it?</P>
<P>If the Law may be bless'd for the <HI>in∣crease</HI> of Grace, why not to the <HI>beginning</HI> of it? but it, doubtless is to the former. Do not pious Souls know by Experience, that the Law helps to humble them, and con∣sequently incites them to prize Christ the more? Why therefore may it not be a Mean of the latter, namely Conversion? But to this, that saying of Paul to the <HI>Ga∣latians</HI> is objected, <HI>viz. received ye the Spi∣rit by the Works of the Law, or by the Hearing of the Faith?</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> The Meaning of the Place, as ap∣pears by the Context is this: That the
<PB N="163" REF="005697_0163_1026C33DB7BCB128"/>
<HI>Galatians</HI> were not made partakers of God's Spirit, either in his ordinary or extraordi∣nary Gifts, by the corrupt Doctrine of the false Teachers, (who had not long before too easily seduced them from the Simplicity of divine Truth, by blending or mixing the Righteousness of Christ and Works to∣gether, in the Point of Justification,) but <HI>before</HI> while they heard the pure Doctrine of Christ; and therefore that it was their <HI>Folly, having begun in the Spirit to end in the Flesh.</HI> As by <HI>the Hearing of Faith,</HI> we are doubtless to understand the Doctrine of of Faith, so by the <HI>Works of the Law,</HI> the Doctrine of the Works of the Law, which the false Apostles taught.</P>
<P>It is unfair and unreasonable, for any to compare the <HI>Law</HI> considered without the Spirit, with the Gospel attended with it, for by the same Rule, we may prefer the Law before the Gospel: <HI>e. g.</HI> We may suppose a Minister opening the <HI>Duties</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> in imitation of our Lord, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matt. v.</NOTE> and the Spirit concurring therewith to the Con∣version
<PB N="164" REF="005697_0164_1026C340AB93C300"/>
of Men: And on the other Hand, suppose one preaching the <HI>Gospel</HI> in all its <HI>Riches</HI> and <HI>Charms,</HI> without the Spirit's Influence and no Effect produc'd.</P>
<P>Having shewn the <HI>relative Goodness</HI> or Usefulness of the <HI>Law</HI> to the <HI>Unregenerate</HI> in divers Instances, I proceed to shew its Use to the <HI>Regenerate.</HI> Now to such the <HI>Law</HI> is a <HI>Rule,</HI> to <HI>direct them</HI> in <HI>their Du∣ty</HI> to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Man,</HI> without which we cannot discern the Depth of Sin. According to this Rule, as explain'd and recommended by the Doctrines and Precepts of the Gospel, and the Grace of God we ought to walk: <HI>Let us,</HI> says the Apostle to the <HI>Philipians, walk by the same Rule, and mind the same Thing:</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 16.</NOTE> There is an Allusion in this Figure to Ar∣chitects, Soldiers or Racers, who all have a Rule to act by, or a certain Measure of their Motions prescrib'd and prefix'd, to which they should conform with exactness: While the Apostle mentions the same <HI>Rule,</HI> he surely had in his Eye some certain, well-known <HI>Cannon</HI> or <HI>Rule,</HI> which had the Stamp of divine Authority upon it, by be∣lieving,
<PB N="165" REF="005697_0165_1026C3424BFCD130"/>
loving Conformity, to which, (as a Mean) God's <HI>Israel</HI> may expect <HI>Peace;</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 16.</NOTE> and this can be no other than the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Law</HI> explain'd, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as before; for besides this there is no certain, compleat, well-known Rule of Action, enjoyn'd upon us by divine Authority.</P>
<P>Now the Law as a <HI>Rule,</HI> is of excellent <HI>Use</HI> to <HI>regenerate Persons,</HI> in the following Respects.</P>
<P N="1">1st. It <HI>discovers Heart Sins:</HI> The <HI>Apostle had not known</HI> the Evil of <HI>Lust, if the Law had not said, thou shalt not covet.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii. 7.</NOTE> There is more Pollution in us than we do or can discover; <HI>Who can understand his Errors,</HI> says the Psalmist, <HI>cleanse thou me from se∣cret Faults.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ps. xix. 12.1</NOTE> Now the Law of God be∣ing exceeding <HI>broad</HI> and <HI>spiritual,</HI> requiring Holiness in our Thoughts, Dispositions and Designs, and forbiding the Contrary, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John iii. 15.</NOTE> must needs have a Tendency to discover to us our spiritual and secret Impieties.</P>
<P N="2">(2dly.) By the aforesaid Discovery, it <HI>tends to humble us,</HI> and consequently to
<PB N="166" REF="005697_0166_1026C34521DF99B0"/>
drive us from a Dependance upon our own Wisdom, Power and Righteousness to Christ, for understanding, Pardon and Strength: When we are made to see how far we come short of that Righteousness the Law requires; nothing tends to humble us more, and make us loath our selves and all we do! which is a Blessing promis'd by the New Covenant, as the Prophet <HI>Eze∣kiel</HI> informs us: And there <HI>shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e remem∣ber your Ways and all your Doings, wherein ye have been defiled, and shall loath your selves in your own Sight, for all your Evils that you have committed.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xx. 43.</NOTE> And therefore we should study the Law more and more, and pray to Jehovah in the <HI>Psalmist</HI>'s Strains, <HI>open th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u mine Eyes, that I may behold won∣drous Things out of thy Law.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxix. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is surely <HI>Ignorance</HI> of God's <HI>Law,</HI> that makes Men <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>Self-righteous,</HI> and conceit that they are perfect. What made the <HI>Pharisees</HI> so confident upon a false Foundation, so Conceity and full of Prejudice against Christ and his Gospel,
<PB N="167" REF="005697_0167_1026C34A12B5B410"/>
but their Ignorance of the Spiritual Extent of the Law? This puffed them up with ambitious Disdain of others, and enclin'd them to say, as the Prophet expresses <HI>it, stand by thy self, come not near to me, for I am holier than thou,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. lxv. 5.</NOTE> and therefore thou are not good enough to converse with me, <HI>I am not as other Men are, or even as this Publicans</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke 18.11.</NOTE> Nothing makes Men more odious to God, than a proud Conceit of themselves and Contempt of others; these are as Smoke in the Nostrils of God, <HI>Smoke</HI> that comes from a Fire of wet Wood that has nothing in it but what is offensive. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isaiah lxv. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">(3dly.) The <HI>Law tends to make us prize Christ</HI> by shewing us our need of him. After <HI>Paul</HI> was enlightned and alarm'd by the <HI>Law,</HI> he was the inclin'd to prize Deliverance by Christ: <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii.</NOTE> Jesus Christ is certainly a Believers Life, <HI>to me to live is Christ,</HI> <NOTE N="‡*" PLACE="foot">Phil. i. 21.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> The Grace of <HI>Christ</HI> was the <HI>Spring</HI> of his <HI>Life,</HI> the <HI>Glory</HI> of <HI>Christ was the Scope</HI> of his <HI>Life,</HI> and the <HI>Offices</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> the <HI>Support</HI> of his <HI>Life:</HI> The
<PB N="168" REF="005697_0168_1026C34D2DC42FC0"/>
true Believer lives daily upon Christ in his <HI>Offices, Prophetical, Priestly</HI> and <HI>King∣ly.</HI> Now the Law by shewing him his Ignorance, Guilt and Weakness, incline<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him to seek <HI>Light</HI> from <HI>Christ</HI> as a <HI>Pro∣phet, Pardon</HI> from <HI>Christ</HI> as a <HI>Priest,</HI> and <HI>Stength</HI> to conquer Sin and perform Duty from <HI>Christ</HI> as a <HI>King,</HI> and thus he is led by the Law to <HI>come up out of the Wilderness</HI> of this World <HI>leaning on his beloved.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. viii. 5.</NOTE>,</P>
<P N="4">(4thly.) The <HI>Law excites to Duty,</HI> both by its <HI>Precepts</HI> and <HI>Penalties:</HI> As a <HI>Good</HI> it rouses the Believer out of his Sloth and Security, and excites him to <HI>work out the Work of his Salvation with fear and trembling.</HI> Altho' the Regenerate have a new Nature, which disposes them to Ho∣liness, and are principally influenced to Obedience from <HI>Love;</HI> yet they need the Discipline of Fear: Nor is there any in∣consistency between a predominant Love to God as a Father, and a Fear of offend∣ing by Sin, as well as the Consequences of the Offence.</P>
<P><PB N="169" REF="005697_0169_1026C350A28F5210"/>I may add, that the Law is of singular Service to the People of God, in bringing them to a compassionate and merciful Frame of Spirit towards others that have fallen, by shewing them their own Defor∣mities and Blunders! And as this is a noble Attainment in it self, so it is of great Use in promoting the Good of Society. <Q>The <HI>Law</HI> is likewise of great <HI>Use</HI> to <HI>Believers,</HI> (as the <HI>Westminster Assembly</HI> justly observe) in shewing them how much they are bound to Christ for his fulfiling it, and enduring the Curse thereof in their Stead and for their Good, and thereby to pro∣voke them to more thankfulness, and to express the same in their greater Care to conform themselves thereunto as the Rule of their Obedience.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Believer</HI> is under a <HI>peculiar</HI> and superadded Obligation to obey the <HI>Law,</HI> for he is not only bound by God's Sove∣reignty, over him in common with others, as he is God's Creature, but he is constrain∣ed by the dying Love of Christ, as he is a Believer. Now inasmuch as the Precepts and Penalties of the Moral Law being
<PB N="170" REF="005697_0170_1026C35235469490"/>
exact and great, they serve to shew the Riches and Greatness of the Redeemer's Love, who was willing to be <HI>made under the Law,</HI> and did fulfil its Demands for us; and thus our Gratitude is incited, which cannot be better express'd then by a willing, unfeigned, unfainting, universal Obedience to God's Law, which we owe to <HI>God</HI> as our rightful Lord and Sovereign, our Crea∣tor, Benefactor and Father; to <HI>Christ</HI> as our King and Redeemer, and to the Holy Spirit as our Sanctifier.</P>
<P>But beside these spiritual Benefits of the Moral Law to the Unregenerate and Rege∣nerate, which have been mentioned, the Law promotes the temporal Good of both; this is the <HI>Guardian</HI> and <HI>Barrier</HI> of all that is naturally dear to us; hereby our Names and Estates, our Liberties and Lives are protected from Injustice and Violence!</P>
<P>But I proceed to offer a Word of Im∣provement. And</P>
<P><HI>First:</HI> Methinks what has been said concerning the Use of the Moral Law, should excite you to examine your Consci∣ences, whether you have found the afore∣said

Effects of it in your selves? O! have ye felt its convincing and condemning Power? Have ye been thereby thro' the Influence of God's Holy Spirit, brought to see not only the Evils of your Practice, but also that Fountain of Corruption in the Heart from which they proceed? Particularly have ye been convinc'd of your Unbelief? Your total Want of true Faith and Inability to Believe, as well as your utter Unworthiness of the Gift of Faith from God? O! were ye ever made sensible that ye were in a perishing State with the Prodigal? And has the Spirit of God become a <HI>Spirit of Bon∣dage to fear</HI> to your Souls? Shewing you thro' the Condemnation of that righteous Law ye have broken, the Greatness, Cer∣tainty and Eternity of that <HI>Misery</HI> you were thereby expos'd to, in such a strong Light as to affect your Souls with bitter Anguish and Distress, and excite anxious Enquiries after the Way of Deliverance therefrom? And were ye Restless, till being made to despair of your own <HI>Wisdom, Power</HI> and <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and of sufficient Help from any meer Creature, ye were enabled by the Holy Spirit, upon a Discovery of

Christ's Sufficiency and Willingness, (to help poor sin-sick Souls that fly to him for shelter) to venture your wounded, weary Souls by believing upon him, as the only Foundation of Acceptance with God? And have ye been since enclin'd to love the holy <HI>Law</HI> of God as a perfect Rule of Life, because of its <HI>Author,</HI> its excellent <HI>Properties</HI> and <HI>Effects?</HI> And has it been your chief Desire and Endeavour in gene∣ral to conform to it in Heart and Practice, from Love to him as a Father, and Fear of him as a Master and Lord? And have your Defects therein been for the general your chief Grief? If you can answer with a good Conscience in the Affirmative, you are sincere and in a gracious State. O! what cause have ye to love God, my dear Brethren, to exalt him and rejoice in him, in all Changes of outward Circumstance! O how distinguishing and affecting is the Mercy of God towards you! in bringing his blessed Law to your Hearts, and you thereby to the holy Jesus? And that while many others sit as senseless Stones under the same Word; the very Sermon

which was bless'd to your Conviction or Conversion, perhaps some poor, ignorant, conceity Creatures in the same Assembly, cavil'd with and snarl'd at, and went away and told gross Lies about it, in order to blacken the Speaker instead of getting Good by it. O admire! admire! the rich, the glorious Grace of God! and let that Law that the blessed God has made a Mean of such Good to your Souls, be ever esteemed by you; take it as the Rule of your Prac∣tice, <HI>meditate upon it all the Day,</HI> and let it be the chief Labour of your Life to con∣form to it in Heart and Conversation. O make Use of the Law of God to convince you of Sin, to humble you for Sin, and ex∣cite you to thankfulness and practical Ho∣liness. Dear Brethren! Let not your <HI>Re∣ligion</HI> lie chiefly at the <HI>Tip</HI> of your <HI>Tongues,</HI> but watch your <HI>Hearts,</HI> and bring forth the <HI>Fruits</HI> of <HI>Holiness</HI> or <HI>Obedience</HI> to God's Law in your Lives.</P>
<P>But alas! how much is the Case of such to be pitied and lamented, who want the aforesaid Experiences! All ye to whose Hearts the Law of God has not been

brought in its condemning Influence, who have not seen the false Grounds of your Hopes, the Filthiness of your Hearts, and the Badness of your States, and who have never been shut up to Christ as the only Door of Hope by the Law, are false-hearted Hypocrites!</P>
<P>And what ground is there to suspect the State of such who grow weary of Obedi∣dience to God's Law, and look upon it to be a State of Bondage? <HI>i. e.</HI> In other Words, it is bondage to be <HI>Holy,</HI> in their Opinion; for Obedience to God's Law, from Love to God and regard to his com∣manding Authority, is the very Nature of Holiness, as I have prov'd before: They therefore neglect the stated Performance of Duty in their Closets and Families, and count this Christian Liberty, whereas it is only a fleshly Gratifying the wicked Sloth of Nature: Christian Liberty is a Freedom from Sin, and not from Righteousness; <HI>as free</HI> (says the Apostle <HI>Peter) and yet not using your Liberty as a Cloak of Malicious∣ness, but as the Servants of God.</HI> Those that are Christ's Freemen, are God's Ser∣vants,
<PB N="175" REF="005697_0175_1026C36129B0E1D0"/>
and do manifest it by Obedience to his Authority. Christ has never purchased by his Blood, a Liberty, or rather a Li∣cence for any to commit Wickedness. O! its a Sign of an unholy Heart in any, to be weary of the Yoke of God's Precepts, and to say with the Wicked, <HI>let us break their Bands asunder, and cast their Cords from us.</HI> Those that are sincerely Holy, love God's Law, <HI>it is their Meditation all the Day,</HI> and they look upon Obedience to it, to be sweet Liberty!</P>
<P>But on the Contrary, obstinate Trans∣gressors <HI>break the Yoke, and burst the Bands.</HI> Sirs! it is a dreadful Instance of Wicked∣ness, to pretend that the Gospel or Grace of God, frees from Obedience to the Law; that is, to make the Gospel an Instrument of the vilest Iniquity, and to say in other Words, that it gives Men licence to re∣nounce God's Authority over them, and rise up in Rebellion against his Crown and Scep∣ter! or that it has put an End to all Ho∣liness in those that accept it.

<P>My Brethren!

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DEAR Brethren! Seeing the right Understanding of the proper Use of the Law of God, together with its <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Excellency,</HI> is of so great Moment in Religion, I hope you will not think it strange that I have repeat∣edly insisted upon so important a Subject, and especially considering, that it is somewhat difficult to explain and state in an easy Light, to the Overthrow of all the Cavils and So∣phisms with which it has been obscur'd and oppos'd, either by the Designing or Inju∣dicious: This I could not do in a very narrow Compass, and therefore have been led reluctant to Proxility.</P>
<P><PB N="187" REF="005697_0187_1026C387C3D9A820"/>I have been likewise induced, my Bre∣thren, the more to ruminate upon this Sub∣ject, because it is much misunderstood by some, and slighted by others in the present Day!</P>
<P>It is certainly our Duty in a special Man∣ner, to labour to understand well those precious Truths, that are controverted in the Times and Places in which we live, (especially if they concern practical Reli∣gion, and have considerable Influence upon it) that so we may be preserv'd from the Infection of the Times, and glorify God as his Witnesses, in bearing a judicious and faithful Testimony to God's Truths, how∣ever they are ignorantly opposed by some, and basely disserted and betrayed by others!</P>
<P>It is as the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> observes, <HI>the ignorant and unstable, that wrest the Scrip∣tures to their own Destruction:</HI> It is these <HI>simple, silly</HI> Souls, that false Teachers <HI>deceive with their good Words and fair Speeches,</HI> and therefore it is no wonder they cry out against <HI>Head-Knowledge,</HI> because it ob∣structs the Spread of their erroneous, in∣consistent
<PB N="188" REF="005697_0188_1026C38A84280E70"/>
and nonsensical Sentiments, tho' in the mean time, the God of Truth on the contrary denounces his awful Judg∣ments upon the Ignorant, <HI>this is a People of no Understanding, and therefore he that made them will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no fa∣vour.</HI></P>
<P>My Dear Brethren! forget not to ab∣hor and oppose that vile <HI>Popish</HI> Notion, <HI>that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion!</HI> If they had said that it was the Mother of <HI>Superstition, Enthusiasm</HI> and <HI>Nonsense,</HI> they wou'd have said right, but true Reli∣gion is grounded in Knowledge. I pass from this to observe, that I have in the preceeding Sermon, endeavour'd to shew you, <HI>the Dignity and Excellency of the Moral Law,</HI> by mentioning the <HI>Honours</HI> that the blessed God put upon it at its Promulgation, as well as by explaining five honourable <HI>Characters,</HI> that the Holy Scriptures assign to it. What remains now, is to offer some more scriptural <HI>Characters</HI> or Properties of the Moral Law, to answer
<PB N="189" REF="005697_0189_1026C38C0BAA8E98"/>
some <HI>Objections,</HI> and then proceed to the <HI>Improvement</HI> of the whole. The</P>
<P><HI>Sixth</HI> Character therefore that I wou'd mention, is, that it is a <HI>perfect Law.</HI> Now the Law of God is perfect in the following Respects, <HI>viz. Essentially, Extensively, In∣tensively,</HI> and <HI>Finally.</HI></P>
<P>The Law is perfect in its <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Essence,</HI> so as to contain in it a compleat Rule of all things, that are to be done and a∣voided by every one, towards God and towards his Neighbour; so that there is no Work truly and properly Good, which does not agree with it, and is not prescrib'd by it. Whatsoever is neither commanded nor forbid by it, is in its Nature indiffe∣rent, and left to Men's Liberty, except that Liberty be restrained by some possitive Precept.</P>
<P>The Moral Law is likewise perfect <HI>ex∣tensively,</HI> in respect of its <HI>Parts,</HI> it enjoyns Love to God and Man, and therein in∣cludes all the Duties we owe to both; and therefore the People of <HI>Israel</HI> were forbid

to add any Thing to it, or diminish any thing from it. <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Deut iv. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>Again the blessed Law of God is <HI>perfect Intensively,</HI> in respect of <HI>Degrees;</HI> it re∣quires perfect Love, the most supreme, transcendent and intense Affection, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> which greater cannot be, as I shall shew afterwards.</P>
<P>Add to this, that the Moral Law is per∣fect <HI>Finally,</HI> in respect of its orginial Use and Design; it could give Life to the perfect Observers of it: This the Almighty him∣self declar'd to <HI>Moses</HI> in these Words, <HI>ye shall therefore keep my Statutes and my Judgments, which if a Man do he shall live in them.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lev. xviii. v.</NOTE> Man's contracted inability to keep the Law to Perfection, is his own Fault, and therefore cannot be justly charg'd upon the Law of God.</P>
<P>The Perfection of the Law appears from the Design of Christ's coming, which was not to <HI>destroy,</HI> but to <HI>fulfil it.</HI> The original Word, <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Plerosai.</NOTE> by a <HI>Hebraism,</HI> signifies to do what was enjoyned by it. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxii. 37.

<HI>Old,</HI> in respect of its first <HI>Promulgation</HI> un∣der the Old Testament Dispensation, and <HI>new</HI> in respect of <HI>Renovation</HI> and <HI>Illustra∣tion</HI> under the Gospel. <HI>Brethren I write no new Commandment unto you, but an old Commandment which ye had from the Be∣ginning:</HI> And hence we may safely con∣clude, that the <HI>Moral Law</HI> is <HI>perfect.</HI> To suppose that God gave an imperfect Law at first, is to charge him with Want of Wisdom, Holiness or Fidelity, and to ima∣gine that Christ alter'd it, is to impute Iniquity to him, both which are blasphe∣mous!</P>
<P>No my Brethren! Christ has added no new Precept to the Law of a Moral Na∣ture, the Prophets of the Old Testament, and our Lord under the New, do but ex∣plain it, and add not any Moral Duty different from it; <HI>the Law of the Lord is perfect converting the Soul, the Testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple: The Statutes of the Lord are right, rejoicing the Heart.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm xix. 7, 8.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="005697_0193_1026C3965C33AA60"/>It is true, under the Old Testament Dis∣pensation, many Things were express'd more obscurely and grosly, yet the Duties commanded were as spiritual as under the Gospel; the Differences as to the Mani∣festation of Duties, is not in <HI>Kind</HI> but <HI>Degree</HI> only: This will appear by the fol∣lowing Induction of Particulars, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> requir'd <HI>Faith.</HI> The first Table of it enjoyn'd Persons to <HI>take the Lord for their God</HI> in a <HI>covenant Way;</HI> which cannot be done without Faith.

<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation requir'd <HI>Love,</HI> and that in the highest Degree of Eminence; and hence our Lord in his Explication of the Moral Law observes, that the Sum of it is Love. <HI>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind, and with all thy Strength: this is the First Commandment, and the Se∣cond is like, namely this, thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy Self: There is none other

Commandment greater than these.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mic. vii. 9.</NOTE> Does or can the Gospel require stronger Love, than what our Saviour shews to be demanded by the Law? No surely! For more cannot be in the Nature of Things.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> It required spiritual <HI>Aims</HI> in religious Worship. And hence the Lord complain'd, that some of the People of <HI>Israel fasted, but not to him;</HI> and on this Account <HI>Israel</HI> is condemn'd, <HI>as an empty Vine, because he brought forth Fruit to him∣self:</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hos. x. 1.</NOTE> But on the contrary, how spiritual and noble were the Aims of the Prophets <HI>Mica</HI> and <HI>David?</HI> who spake in the fol∣lowing Language: <HI>I will bear the Indigna∣tion of the Lord, because I have sinned against him.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mark xii. 30, 31.</NOTE> <HI>Against thee, thee only have I sinned.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Psalm li. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> prefer'd <HI>Mortification</HI> and <HI>internal Piety,</HI> before <HI>outward Services.</HI> And hence the Psalmist assures us, that a <HI>broken and contrite Heart was more ac∣ceptable to God, than burnt Offerings and Sacrifices.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mark xii. 30, 31.</NOTE> The Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> likewise

expresses in the strongest Terms, God's Ab∣horrence of all external Acts of Religion, when due care is not taken to get the Heart sanctify'd and the Life reform'd: <HI>To what Purpose is the Multitude of your Sacrifices unto me? Sayeth the Lord: I am full of the burnt Offerings of Rams, and the Fat of fed Beasts: bring no more vain Obla∣tions: Incense is an Abomination unto me — Your New Moons and your appointed Feasts my Soul hateth, they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them: Your Hands are full of Blood: Wash ye make ye clean, put away the Evil of your doings from before mine Eyes.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah i.</NOTE> Now what can be more spiritual and excellent than this, to prefer inward Graces to outward Duties?</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dis∣pensation, required a <HI>Worship issuing</HI> from the <HI>Heart;</HI> to make this evident let it be only considered as a general Rule, that whatsoever Moral Duty the Prophets urge, they do it as explainers of the Moral Law; their Instructions and Inculcations respect∣ing
<PB N="196" REF="005697_0196_1026C3D125EEF3E8"/>
Things of <HI>Moral Nature,</HI> are but the unfolding of the Law!</P>
<P>Now how often is the Heart required under the Old Testament? To this pur∣pose are the following Passages recorded by <HI>Solomon</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah, My Son give me thine Heart, and let thine Eyes observe my Ways.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxiii. 26.</NOTE> <HI>Plow up your fallow Ground, and take away the fore-skins of your Heart, ye Men of</HI> Judah. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. iv.</NOTE> And elsewhere the <HI>Jews</HI> were enjoyn'd, to <HI>make them a new Heart.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xviii 31.</NOTE> <HI>To turn to God with all their Hearts, and with Fasting, and with Weeping, and with Mourning, and to rent their Hearts and not their Garments.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Joel ii. 12, 13.</NOTE></P>
<P>It is true, the most were unacquainted with the spiritual internal Part of Religion, and rested upon Externals: And isn't it so now under the Gospel Dispensation? Yes surely! But such as were truly Reli∣gious, labour'd to get their Hearts duly engag'd in God's Service; an Instance of this we have in the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> who pray'd,
<PB N="197" REF="005697_0197_1028D76898D22428"/>
<HI>that God would unite his Heart to fear his Name.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm lxxxvi 11.</NOTE> Our Thoughts and Affections are apt to be divided and scattered in Acts of Worship, partly by reason of our in∣ward Corruptions, and partly by Tempta∣tions from without, which obstruct both our Comfort and Benefit: This the <HI>Psal∣mist</HI> was aware of, and therefore prays a∣gainst a divided Heart.</P>
<P><HI>Sixthly.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation required <HI>Joy,</HI> or Complacence in God, more than in Creatures; and is not this a high Pitch of Spirituality recom∣mended by the Gospel? Hence we are bid to <HI>rejoice in the Lord always: i. e.</HI> We should seek the <HI>Seed</HI> of divine <HI>Joy</HI> by <HI>Conversion,</HI> and a <HI>Right</HI> to it by <HI>Justifica∣tion,</HI> and use all proper Means to acquire and preserve a Temper of Mind dispos'd to constant Complacency in God's Attri∣butes, Word and Works, and express this outwardly on all proper Occasions; for <HI>every Thing,</HI> as <HI>Solomon</HI> observes, <HI>is beautiful in its Season:</HI> And we are else∣where

<P><HI>Seventhly.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> under the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation requir'd <HI>Self-denyal, enduring the Cross,</HI> and the <HI>Imitation</HI> of <HI>Christ.</HI> For when we are commanded to love God above all, we are consequently commanded to deny all, and endure all for him, that we may be call'd to in the Course of Pro∣vidence, rather than forsake his Truths and Service. Without this the Sincerity of our Love cannot be manifested, and while the Law prescribes so frequently our <HI>Imitati∣on</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> it at the same Time enjoyns the Imitation of Christ, who is the true God. And what is the Imitation of Christ requir'd, but in respect of those Moral Vertues of which the Law is Rule, un∣der which Christ as Man was made, and to which he perfectly conform'd?</P>
<P>And what shining Examples have we, my Brethren, of the Vertues now men∣tion'd, under the <HI>Jewish</HI> OEconomy?
<PB N="200" REF="005697_0200_1026C3A7F539AFC8"/>
What <HI>Self-Denyal</HI> did <HI>Abraham</HI> express, in leaving his native Soil? And in his At∣tempt to slay his <HI>darling Son!</HI> The Son of the Promise, the Son of his aged Years, and of his pregnant Hopes; the Staff of his Comforts in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Wane of Life; yet having a divine Injunction, he immediately denies all that is naturally dear, and by superior Resolution surmounts the strong Tyes of Nature, and passionate Yernings of a Father's Bowels, and takes the sacri∣ficing Knife to give the mortal Stroke! O amazing Prodigy of Self-denyal! Be a∣stonish'd ye Heavens, and wonder O Earth at this! And how glorious likewise is the Instance of <HI>Job,</HI> who under a Complication of the most distressing Calamities of various Forms, bore the formidable Shock with unbroken Magnanimity, and bless'd his God! Pray Brethren, does any Instance of the Saints Self-denyal under the Gospel ex∣ceed these? No surely! And to these we might add, the Example of <HI>Moses,</HI> who <HI>refus'd to be call'd the Son of</HI> Pharaoh<HI>'s Daughter, chusing rather to suffer Affliction with the People of God, than to enjoy the
<PB N="201" REF="005697_0201_1028D76B75C64FC8"/>
Pleasures of Sin for a Season, esteeming the Reproach of Christ greater Riches than the Treasures of Egypt:</HI> And we should like∣wise <HI>take the Prophets</HI> (as the Apostle <HI>James</HI> observes) <HI>for an Example of Suffering, Affliction, and of Patience.</HI></P>
<P>And altho' the <HI>Law</HI> does not directly and formally command <HI>Repentance,</HI> because it opens 10 Door of Hope to a Sinner, and so it properly belongs to the Gospel, yet it is referr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d materially and indirectly to the Law, because by that a Rule of good living and pleasing God is prescrib'd, which is the Scope of Repentance. It should be also observ'd, that under the Duties en∣joyn'd by the Law towards God and our Neighbour, Duties that respect our selves are included, without which the other cannot be perform'd.</P>
<P>Altho' the <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation was not so clear as the present, yet you may see that some who were diligent in God's Ser∣vice, arriv'd to great Eminence in good∣ness: Where is there any under the Gos∣pel that exceed?</P>
<P>We declare with the reform'd Churches,
<PB N="202" REF="005697_0202_1026C3D55F494318"/>
in Opposition to the <HI>Manichees, Turks, Pa∣pists, Scocinians, Arminians, Antinomia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> and <HI>Enthusiasts,</HI> that our Lord, excepting a few positive Precepts, has made nothing Duty now, which was not so before.</P>
<P>The Law is perfect, as has been prov'd before; and to that which is perfect no∣thing can be added of the like kind; and hence the People of <HI>Israel</HI> were enjoyn'd, not to add to it or detract from it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. iv. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>Altho' the Gospel far exceeds, in res∣pect of the <HI>Remedy</HI> prescrib'd for poor Sin∣ners, and the Display of divine Grace therein, yet there cannot be a more ex∣cellent Way of Holiness than the Moral Law prescribes, because of its conformity to the divine Nature.</P>
<P>Nothing greater or more noble can be requir'd, than those Duties recommended by the Moral Law, which have been men∣tioned. The Moral Law not only points to the best End, but prescribes the best Mea∣sures to attain it.</P>
<P>Nor did our Lord in his Sermon on the
<PB N="203" REF="005697_0203_1026C3E555AE4330"/>
Mount, <HI>correct</HI> or <HI>increase</HI> the Moral Law, but only <HI>remove</HI> the <HI>Rubbish</HI> of the false In∣terpretations of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> that so it might break out and shine in its own na∣tive Beauty and Glory.</P>
<P>As to those Passages in the Writings of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> wherein he speaks dimi∣nutively of the Law, they are to be under∣stood either of the ceremonial Law, that <HI>Hand-writing of Ordinances which was nail'd to the Cross of Christ,</HI> or of the whole <HI>Jewish</HI> Dispensation, compar'd with that brighter Dispensation of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Gospel which we enjoy, or of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al Law consider'd as a Covenant of Work, or de∣pended on for Justification. We are sure that <HI>Paul</HI> speaks highly of the Law, and therefore cannot speak meanly of it in the same Sense, otherwise he is not consistent with himself, which is absurd to suppose! He himself gives us a Key to open those Difficulties, by assuring us in his Epistle to <HI>Timothy, that the Law is good if a Man use it lawfully.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 8.</NOTE> It is the <HI>abuse</HI> of the
<PB N="204" REF="005697_0204_1026C3D6F9583CA0"/>
Law which the Apostle opposes, in most Places where he seems to speak diminu∣tively of it. Now the Law is abus'd va∣rious Ways, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1st.) When Men turn it into frivolous and unprofitable <HI>Disputes,</HI> when they darken it with obscure and impertinent Questions of no Moment, and do not la∣bour to lead Men to Christ by it: This is doubtless what <HI>Paul</HI> reproves some false Teachers for in his Epistle to <HI>Timo∣thy, desiring,</HI> says he, <HI>to be teachers of the Law, understanding neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 7.</NOTE> These Teachers gave heed to <HI>Fables,</HI> and endless <HI>Geneo∣logies, turn'd from Faith, Love and a good Conscience to vain jangling,</HI> and were but Ignoramusses in respect of Knowledge: But after the Apostle had reprov'd the a∣foresaid Bablers he immediately adds, <HI>Knowing this that the Law is good, if a Man use it lawfully.</HI> He mentions this to open his Meaning, and shew that it was not the Law it self he spoke against, but the abuse of it.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="205" REF="005697_0205_1026C4AD9656FE80"/>(2dly.) The <HI>Law</HI> is <HI>abus'd</HI> when it is <HI>interpreted</HI> in a <HI>gross and carnal Manner,</HI> so as to restrain it's Meaning to Externals. This the <HI>Pharisees</HI> of old were Guilty of, whose corrupt Glosses ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Saviour exposes in his Sermon on the Mount, shewing that it extended even to the Thoughts and Desires of the Heart. And the <HI>Papists</HI> do likewise corrupt the Law in making it in a great Part to be as a Council and not Obligatory, and by making the <HI>Power</HI> of Man the <HI>Measure</HI> of his <HI>Duty.</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3dly.) The <HI>Law</HI> is <HI>abus'd</HI> when Men <HI>oppose it to Christ;</HI> and this was doubtless the great Error of the <HI>Jews,</HI> against which the Apostle argues in his Epistles to the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI> and <HI>Galatians,</HI> their labouring to mix the Righteousness of Christ and Obedi∣ence to the Law together, as the Matter of their Justification before God, was to op∣pose them to each other, <HI>for if it be of Grace it is no more of Works.</HI></P>
<P N="4">(4thly.) When Persons, with the <HI>Pa∣pists</HI> and <HI>Arminians, look for Justification as the certain Consequence of their Obedi∣ence to the Law,</HI> and imagine that they
<PB N="206" REF="005697_0206_1026C3DC61638FC8"/>
can commend themselves thereby to God, and lay him under any Obligation to for∣give their Sins. This is to establish a Way of Justification of <HI>Debt,</HI> and not of Grace: This is injurious to the Sovereignty of God, and darkens the Glory of divine Grace: This opens a new Covenant of Works, flatters the Creatures Pride, and fixes him upon a false Foundation, <HI>it is not of him that willeth, or him that runneth, but of God that sheweth Mercy.</HI></P>
<P N="5">(5thly) The <HI>Law</HI> is <HI>abus'd</HI> when any, with the <HI>Manichees</HI> and <HI>Antinomians, re∣ject</HI> it as a <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Life,</HI> and consequently judge Obedience to it unnecessary. This is in other Words to reject Holiness alto∣gether, as appears thus, If Sin be a <HI>Trans∣gression of the Law,</HI> as the Apostle <HI>John</HI> observes, then it follows by the Rule of contraries, that Holiness is a Conformity to it: But if the Law be utterly rejected, how can it be conform'd to? And <HI>without Ho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how shall any Man see the Lord?</HI></P>
<P>If the Law should be rejected, because we have not a Power to keep it per∣fectly, then the Gospel must be rejected too
<PB N="207" REF="005697_0207_1026C4552FE48750"/>
by the same Rule; for who can believe and repent to Perfection? To do a Thing out of Love to God and Obedience to his Law are not inconsistent; for the one is but a Fruit of the other. <HI>If ye Love me</HI> (said the Blessed Jesus to his Disciples) <HI>keep my Commandments: he that hath my Com∣mandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 15.21.</NOTE> Agreeable to this the Apostle <HI>John</HI> observes, <HI>He that sayeth I know him, and keepeth not his Commandments, is a Lyar, and the Truth is not in him: But whoso keepeth his Word, in him verily is the Love of God perfected.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John ii. 4, 5.</NOTE> Surely those that love God sincerely, will be thereby inclin'd to regard his Authority. <HI>Adam</HI> while he stood obey'd from Love, and yet had a Respect to the Command: And was there not a Commandment laid upon CHRIST to fulfil the Law for us? <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 John x. 18.</NOTE> And yet he did it out of Love. <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 31.</NOTE> The Mother of <HI>Moses</HI> had a Command to nurse him, and yet she obey'd from Love.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="005697_0208_1026C3DF4F573348"/>Its in vain to pretend, to advance the Grace of God in Opposition to the Law; he that destroys the one, must the other also.

<P>Shall Obedience to the Law be utterly rejected because it dosn't Justify? Then Faith it self must be rejected also, for that dosn't justify considered as a Work: Be∣cause Gold cannot be eaten, is it therefore of no use, and must it be cast away? But to proceed,</P>
<P N="7">(7thly) It is a <HI>Law of Liberty:</HI> This the Apostle <HI>James</HI> asserts in the following Words; <HI>But whoso looketh into the perfect Law of Liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful Hearer, but a doer of the Work, this Man shall be blessed in his deed.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James i. 25.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> In the way of sincere Endea∣vours after the Knowledge of our Duty,

by a careful inspecting into the Meaning of the Moral Law, and a believing, loving, persevering Performance thereof. In Obe∣dience to said Law, a Man can only expect Blessedness hereafter, and possess true Li∣berty here. This Sense of the Words is agreeable to the general Scope of this E∣pistle, which is to demonstrate the Neces∣sity, Excellency and Advantage of good Works, in opposition to <HI>Libertines,</HI> who depended upon a dead, ineffectual Faith, and outward Priviledges unimproved, as well as to the preceeding and following Ver∣ses, which press practical Holiness and shew the Insufficiency of external Priviledges, and pious Pretences without it.</P>

<P N="8">(8thly) The <HI>Moral Law</HI> is a <HI>pleasant Law,</HI> considered as a Rule of Life, and as it is ad∣ded to the Covenant of Grace. I say it is pleasant to all good Men, and that for this Reason, because it is perfectly Holy. Con∣verted Persons having a holy Principle im∣planted in them by the blessed Spirit, are thereby induced to love Holiness, and therefore they love God not only because of

his Mercy, but also because of his Holiness. The Purity of God's Nature appears dear and venerable to them, and hereby they in some Degree imitate the Example of the Seraphims, who are much delighted with the Views of God's Holiness, and in pleas∣ing transport proclaim its Glory, as the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> witnesseth. And now in∣asmuch as the Moral Law is a bright Em∣blem of Jehovah's <HI>Purity,</HI> they cannot but be delighted with its <HI>Beauty;</HI> for therein, as in a Glass, they behold the <HI>Holiness</HI> of God, which is exceeding agree∣able to their new Nature: And hence the Psalmist represents it to be the Character of a good Man, <HI>that he delights in the Law of the Lord, and meditates in his Law Day and Night.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm i.</NOTE> And he expresses his own Love to it and Delight in it in the following Manner: <HI>I hate vain Thoughts, but thy Law I do love.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxix.</NOTE> <HI>Thy Testimonies have I taken as a Heritage for ever: For they are the rejoicing of my Heart.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ps. cxix.</NOTE> <HI>O how love I thy Law!

<P>Altho' <HI>Christian Liberty,</HI> my Brethren, frees us from the <HI>Curse</HI> of the <HI>Moral Law,</HI>
<PB N="220" REF="005697_0220_1026C3F1F7E46920"/>
the <HI>Yoke</HI> of the <HI>Ceremonial,</HI> the <HI>Rigour</HI> of the <HI>Jewish Dispensation,</HI> the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and <HI>Bondage</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> yet it does not free us from the Necessity of <HI>Obe∣dience to God,</HI> which is indispensable from every Creature considered as such. What tho' Persons be regenerated and adopted, yet they remain God's <HI>Creatures</HI> still; yea these Mercy's lay them under greater Obli∣gations to Obedience: A Liberty from Sin necessarily infers, the Servitude of Grace; <HI>Being then made free from Sin, ye became the Servants of Righteousness.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 18.</NOTE> Yea our Liberty consists in Subjection to God, for it is not a <HI>fleshly Liberty,</HI> that indeed is incon∣sistent with the Moral Law, but a <HI>spiritual Liberty,</HI> which agrees well with it and is inseparable from it. The Words of the Apostle to the <HI>Galatians</HI> are excellent to this purpose; <HI>For Brethren ye have been call'd to Liberty, only use not Liberty for an occasion to the Flesh.—For all the Law is fulfill'd in one Word, even in this, thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 13, 14.</NOTE> Here it is
<PB N="221" REF="005697_0221_1026C42FAEE26160"/>
as plain as well can be, that <HI>Paul</HI> judged <HI>a Freedom from the Law</HI> as a <HI>Rule,</HI> a <HI>fleshly Liberty.</HI> And truly so it is, an abominable, <HI>filthy Liberty,</HI> to be abhor'd by all that fear God!</P>
<P>And why is the Gospel sometimes call'd a Law? <HI>the Law of the Spirit of Life,</HI> but to shew, that there is a wise Constitution of God under the Gospel Dispensation, without a Complyance with which, we can have no Benefit by its gracious Propo∣sals; and also to signify that the Gospel is not without the Moral Law, which is now indeed propos'd to Believers, in a more mild and gentle Dress, than obtain'd un∣der the <HI>Jewish</HI> OEconomy; but neverthe∣less it still obliges all rational Creatures to Obedience that enjoy it.</P>
<P>But the <HI>perpetual Duration of the Moral Law,</HI> as a rule of Life to all intelligent Crea∣tures, appears especially from the follow∣ing Considerations namely, the <HI>Depend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of the Creature upon God; the Nature of its Precepts; the <HI>Difference between them and the ceremonial Law</HI> as well as from their <HI>Conformity</HI> to the <HI>Divine Na∣ture,</HI>
<PB N="222" REF="005697_0222_1026C3F961B6C490"/>
and their <HI>sameness</HI> for Substance with the <HI>Law of Nature.</HI></P>
<P>That the Creature is necessarily Depen∣dant on God, is a self evident Proposition; for otherwise it would not be a Creature, <HI>In God we live, move and have our Being.</HI> Now, an Obligation to obedience flows necessarily from this, as appears thus: <HI>Je∣hovah</HI> has a Right to the Creature's Service, not only because of the <HI>Independance, Self-existence</HI> and transcendent <HI>Perfection</HI> of his <HI>Being,</HI> but because he is the Author of the Creature's <HI>Being</HI> and all its <HI>Benefits.</HI> Now seeing the Almighty gave to Man a Capacity to perform Acts of Worship and Obedience to his Creator, it is but reasonable that the Almighty should re∣quire his <HI>Due.</HI> And on the Contrary its very unreasonable to imagine that God gave Powers to his Creatures to no pur∣pose, or cast off all Care about them! It is equally absur'd to suppose, either that God should make his rational Creatures for no valuable End, or that he should not propose proper Means to attain it, or cease requiring a Compliance with those Means!</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="005697_0223_1026C3ACC4CA68F0"/>Again let it be considered, my Brethren. that if the Moral Precepts be alterable, then they are only of a <HI>positive Nature;</HI> and if so, the Almighty might either not have enjoyned those Things, or have en∣joyned the Contrary, and so according to this Scheme the Blessed God might not only have neglected giving a Law to the reasonable Creature to love and Worship him, but have commanded him to blas∣pheme and disobey his Creator, to believe in no God at all, or to worship false Gods, yea to worship the very Devil himself! And so the worst of Crimes would commence Virtues, <HI>viz. Atheism, Blasphemy,</HI> and <HI>Lying,</HI> &amp;c. because commanded, which is so monstrous that it needs no Confutati∣on! The Almighty cannot command such Things without denying himself, and con∣tradicting his own Nature: GOD is <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>True,</HI> and therefore it is contrary to his Nature to command what is <HI>base</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd <HI>false!</HI></P>
<P>And indeed, Brethren, if the Precepts of the Moral Law might be disanull'd, there would then be no Difference between it
<PB N="224" REF="005697_0224_10269298918006B8"/>
and the <HI>Ceremonial,</HI> and so no greater O∣bligation to Obedience to the one than the other, and consequently no greater E∣vil in violating the one than the other; and so the Man that touched a dead Body, or eat swines Flesh, would be guilty of as great a Crime as he that <HI>blasphemed</HI> the <HI>Name</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> or <HI>murdered</HI> his <HI>Father,</HI> which is quite rediculous to imagine!</P>
<P>Nor can the <HI>Moral Law</HI> as a <HI>Rule</HI> be destroy'd, because of it's Conformity to the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> it is the Rule of God's I∣mage in Man, in which <HI>Jehovah</HI> has ex∣press'd his Righteousness and Holiness: Now it is unreasonable to think that God would destroy his own Image.</P>
<P>Without Conformity to the <HI>Moral Law</HI> we cannot imitate the <HI>Example</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> to which we are so frequently urg'd in Scripture, and therefore its Observation is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oyn'd as often as <HI>Holiness</HI> is recommended therein, and especially where we are en∣joyn'd to imitate God, and <HI>to be Holy because he is Holy;</HI> and thus it follows by a neces∣sary Consequence, that the <HI>Moral Law</HI> is <HI>unalterable,</HI> and of <HI>perpetual Obligation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="005697_0225_1026C3AFA7A65460"/>Moreover, Sirs, the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> as to it's Substance, is the same with the Law of Na∣ture, which is immutable, and founded in the reasonable Nature of Man.</P>
<P>By the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> I understand the <HI>Light</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> or the <HI>practical Notions</HI> of the <HI>Difference between Moral Good</HI> and <HI>Evil,</HI> which we receive with our Nature; or a practical <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>Moral Duties,</HI> which was originally impress'd on the human Mind when Man was first form'd, to which all Mankind are by Nature oblig'd.</P>
<P>Altho' this <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> was much broken by the Fall of Man, yet that there be some Remains of it in all, we have a∣bundant Evidence from <HI>Scripture, Conscience,</HI> the <HI>consent of Mankind,</HI> and the <HI>Voice</HI> of <HI>Reason.</HI></P>
<P>The Holy Scriptures assure us, that the <HI>Gentiles, who had not the Law, (i. e.</HI> the written Law of <HI>Moses) did by Nature the Things contain'd in the Law, and so were a Law to themselves, and shew'd the Work of the Law written in their Hearts.</HI> And does not the <HI>Conscience</HI> of every Man in∣form him, that <HI>Good</HI> is to be done, and
<PB N="226" REF="005697_0226_1026C3FC0F1F6A08"/>
<HI>Evil</HI> to be avoided? What else is the <HI>Source</HI> of those Uneasinesses for secret E∣vils which do not fall under the Cog∣nizance of human Laws, with which the Wicked are tormented, and all their brutish Delights allay'd with the Forebodings of future Misery?</P>
<P>If there was no <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> why should the most savage and uncultivated Nations own a supream Being, and that he is to be adored as well as our Parents ho∣nour'd, and justice maintain'd? Whence flow all the Laws of Nations respecting Honesty and Justice, if there was no na∣tive Rule of Right implanted in the hu∣man Mind?</P>
<P>And <HI>Reason</HI> likewise gives its <HI>Suffrage</HI> to the Reality of the Law of Nature thus: Seeing the Creature as such depends una∣voidably upon its former, and is govern'd by him <HI>phisically,</HI> it is absur'd to suppose that it should not be govern'd by him also in a <HI>Moral Way,</HI> agreeable to its Nature, which cannot be without a Law. It therefore follows that either Man must be
<PB N="227" REF="005697_0227_1026C3B41B829A40"/>
made independant, or have a natutal Law impress'd upon his Mind!</P>
<P>And indeed innumerable <HI>Inconsistences</HI> follow the contrary Sentiment, <HI>e. g.</HI> If nothing be in its Nature Just, but that which Men judge profitable to them, then it follows that Men are born for themselves and not for the Glory of that Being to whom they owe their Original! Or for the Good of Society, and then all Things would be equally lawful, to love God, or hate him; to honour our Parents, or cut their Throats! Thus every Man's Lust would be his Rule of Actions, and so a Scene of Confusion and Blood would open to the utter Destruction of the Hu∣man Race! If the Law of Nature be de∣stroy'd, my Brethren, then are the Founda∣tions of civil Justice unhing'd, from which Fountains issue Human Laws: Hereby a Way is open'd to <HI>Atheism</HI> in Principle, and the most <HI>sordid Evils</HI> in <HI>Practice,</HI> so that all <HI>Religion, Virtue, Order</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> are hereby entirely subverted, and left ex∣piring in the Agonies of Death.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature</HI> and the
<PB N="228" REF="005697_0228_1026C3FD94BBB570"/>
<HI>Moral Law</HI> are the very same in Sub∣stance, the same Duties towards God and Man, which are prescrib'd by the Moral Law, are contain'd in the Law of Nature: The Sum of the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> as I have before observ'd, is to love God and our Neighbour, and this is the very Law of Nature: All the Precepts of the Moral Law are impress'd on rational Nature, and may be discover'd by its Light: There is nothing in them but right Reason dictates or approves of; nothing but what belongs to all Nations in all Ages of the World; nothing but what is necessary to Human Nature to obtain its proper End, and therefore it ought to be of perpetual Obligation; for rational Nature is ever the same, and like itself, and consequently so must that which is grounded upon it.</P>
<P>The Difference between the <HI>Moral Law</HI> and the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> is only in <HI>Acci∣dentals</HI> and <HI>Circumstantials</HI> as follows: What is contain'd in the Law of Nature, is more clearly and distinctly declar'd in the Moral Law. The Law of Nature was much obscur'd by the Fall of Man, and
<PB N="229" REF="005697_0229_1026C3B636FF6820"/>
therefore there was need of a Renovation of it: The Law of Nature was wrote upon the Mind of Man, and binds all; but the Moral Law upon Tables of Stone, and belongs to those that are privileged with the Knowledge of it: The Law of Na∣ture has nothing but what is Moral in it; but the Moral Law contains some Things that are <HI>positive or ceremonial,</HI> not in its <HI>Pre∣cepts</HI> but in the <HI>Arguments</HI> exciting to the Performance of them. Thus the first Command is enforc'd by an Argument of Gratitude peculiar to the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Na∣tion, viz. <HI>God's bringing them out of</HI> Egypt. And so as to the Fourth, tho' the Duty en∣joyn'd be Moral, namely the <HI>Dedication</HI> of a <HI>seventh Part</HI> of <HI>our Time,</HI> or one Day in Seven to the <HI>Worship of God;</HI> yet the <HI>Specification</HI> of one Day rather than another for that purpose is only positive and therefore alterable; for there is no real Difference in the several Parts of Time as to their <HI>Nature,</HI> all Time is alike in itself, and therefore equally fit for Reli∣gious Worship: And thus it evidently ap∣pears that the <HI>Specification</HI> of one Day
<PB N="230" REF="005697_0230_1026C40210C6CCC0"/>
rather than another cannot be <HI>moral Na∣tural,</HI> or grounded upon the Nature and Reason of Things. This, learned Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> represents in the following Manner. <Q>The Moral Law required no more than one Day of Seven to be kept as a Day of Holy Rest, not this or that particu∣lar Day; the <HI>Jews</HI> learn'd it from the Ceremonial Law, as Christians learn theirs from Christ's and the Apostles Practice. Nor is it any Objection a∣gainst this that the seventh Day from the Creation is mentioned in the Law to those who know how to distinguish betwixt the <HI>Precept</HI> and <HI>the Argument,</HI> the Seventh from the Creation is not in the <HI>Precept</HI> but in the <HI>Argument: For in Six Days,</HI> &amp;c. Now there is nothing more Ordinary than to have Arguments of a particular temporary Con∣cernment used to inforce Precepts of an eternal Obligation; where the Pre∣cepts were first given to that particular People, as to whom those Arguments were of Force, an Instance of which is in the first Commandment as well as
<PB N="231" REF="005697_0231_1026C3BA92F6B0C8"/>
in this: As on the other side Arguments of universal Force are oft annext to Pre∣cepts which had but a particular Obli∣gation upon a particular People for a Time. Thus in the Ceremonial Law we often find it is an Argument to in∣force many Ceremonial Precepts: <HI>For I am the Lord thy God.</HI></Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Pools Annotations upon Mat. v. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>I may add that what has been said is farther confirm'd by an Argument or Ex∣citement of a temporary Nature, which is annex'd to the 5th Commandment, <HI>That thy Days may be long upon the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</HI> This certainly intended the earthly <HI>Canaan</HI> which was promis'd to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and so had something in it peculiar to that Nation which does not extend to us. Now I say excepting those Arguments mentioned, which are annex'd to the First, Fourth, and Fifth Commands, the whole Moral Law is the very same with the Law of Na∣ture, and therefore perpetually binding.</P>
<P>The Law of Nature being <HI>Natural,
<PB N="232" REF="005697_0232_1026C404C4A777A0"/>
Universal,</HI> and <HI>Rational,</HI> must needs en∣dure to the last Period of the Line of Time. And the Moral Law being the same in Substance with it, must needs be of the same Duration.</P>
<P>But I proceed to the <HI>Improvement</HI> of this Subject. And <HI>First:</HI> From what has been said, you may learn the Necessity of <HI>preaching</HI> the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> seeing it is a Mean of so many and important Benefits to the Unconverted and Converted, and that those who neglect it do great Injury to the Souls of Men, and use a Mean which tends but to deceive Men and flatter them to their Ruin! He is a foolish <HI>Builder,</HI> that pretends to raise the Fabrick before he lays the Foundation, or attempts to lay it without digging, in order to it. He is a foolish <HI>Physician,</HI> that pretends to cure a Lethargy by Anodynes. He is a foolish <HI>Surgeon,</HI> or something worse, that pretends to cure an old Ulcer without probing it and searching it first. He is also a foolish <HI>Farmer,</HI> that pretends to sow before he plows. To sound the comfortable Strains of Peace and Pardon, and a Saviour's <HI>Blood,

only</HI> in the Ears of a secure World; tho' it pleases them and may possibly move the softer Passions of some; yet like a <HI>lul-a-by,</HI> it tends to rock or soothe them into a deeper Sleep of Security to their endless Destruction! Such Preachers <HI>daub with untempered Mortar, and slay the Souls of Men by promising them Life,</HI> as the Prophet expresses it.</P>
<P>Such Ministers as have preach'd the Law most, have been most successful; witness <HI>Hooker, Hildersham, Baal, Bolton, Rogers,</HI> and an Army of others of precious Memory. And here give me leave to mention the Testimony of one of the most learned and pious Divines of the <HI>English</HI> Nation, I mean the Reverend Doctor <HI>John Owen,</HI> who in his Treatise of Justification speaks thus:</P>
<P><Q>Let no Man think to understand the Gospel, who knoweth nothing of the Law. God's Constitution and the Nature of Things themselves, have given the Law the Precedency with respect unto Sinners; <HI>For by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin;</HI> and Gospel-Faith is the Souls acting for
<PB N="234" REF="005697_0234_1026C407DE93B688"/>
Deliverance from that State and Condi∣tion, which it is cast under by the Law. And all those Descriptions of Faith, which abound in the Writings of <HI>learned Men,</HI> which do not at least include in them a virtual Respect unto this State and Condition, or the Work of the Law on the Consciences of Sinners, are all of them vain Speculations! There is nothing in this Doctrine which I will more firmly adhere unto than the Necessity of the Convictions mentioned, previous unto true believing, without which, not one Line of it can be understood aright, and Men do but beat the Air in their Con∣tentions about it.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Owen</HI> of Just. p. 133.</NOTE> If any will call us legal Preachers, because we preach the Law; we Answer, that we follow our Lord's Example in so doing, and if they will reproach us for our imitating him, we hope our Master will support us under those unjust Censures, that condemn his Practice as well as ours, and in such Com∣pany we need neither be afraid or asham'd.</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="005697_0235_1026C3C066DD3418"/><HI>Secondly:</HI> We may learn that there is a beautiful Harmony between the Law and Gospel, they mutually honour and establish each other. The <HI>Law</HI> sends us to <HI>Christ</HI> for <HI>Justification,</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> sends us back to the Law for <HI>Direction.</HI> The Law helps us to see the absolute Need of the Gospel, and the Gospel opens before us the transcendent Excellency of the Law. O let us admire the Wisdom, the Good∣ness, the Holiness and Love of God, dis∣play'd in this <HI>Harmony!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly:</HI> From what has been said, we may learn the Danger of rejecting the Law of God. This strikes at the Foundations of the Christian Religion, and directly tends to destroy it entirely! For</P>
<P>Hereby an awful <HI>Bar</HI> is put in the Way of <HI>Conviction, Faith, Repentance, Conver∣sion, Justification, Consolation,</HI> and so by consequence of <HI>eternal Salvation!</HI> How shall poor Sinners be convinc'd if that Law be destroy'd by which is the Knowledge of Sin? And is there any probability that such as are whole in their own Eyes, will apply in earnest to Christ for a Cure?
<PB N="236" REF="005697_0236_1026C40A8A16DED8"/>
Or that those who see no Danger, will fly by Faith to the Refuge set before them?</P>
<P>If there be no Law their can be no Transgression of it, or in other Words, no Sin: And if there be no Sin, what need is there of Repentance? Shall People repent over what is not? No surely! And what need is there of a <HI>Saviour,</HI> to deliver from nothing?</P>
<P>And if the <HI>Moral Law</HI> is destroy'd, does not Justification fall with it? For is not that a Sentence judicially pronounc'd ac∣cording to Law? And how cruel and per∣nicious is it to rob poor Sinners of a Mean of their Conversion to God?</P>
<P>Neither can their be any such Thing as Sanctification or Holiness upon Earth, with∣out the Moral Law. For what is Sancti∣fication, but an inward and outward Con∣formity thereto, or a renewing us after the Image of God, which is his Law? With∣out this, all <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Religion,</HI> inasmuch as they are neither requir'd by God, nor done in Obedience to his com∣manding Authority, (according to the Scheme I propose) are all <HI>Superstition</HI> and
<PB N="237" REF="005697_0237_1026C3C38636F528"/>
<HI>Will-worship;</HI> and consequently instead of being pleasing to God, do provoke his In∣dignation; because they imply a Reflection upon his Wisdom, Goodness or Fidelity; as if he either knew not how to furnish his Creatures with a perfect Law for their Direction, or wanted Goodness and Faith∣fulness to act in pursuance of his Wisdom!</P>
<P>When Men reject the Law of God, they renounce Interpretatively, his Dominion over them, and commence their own Lord's and Masters. And as to their Acts of Ver∣tue and Religion, this Query spoils them all, <HI>Who hath required these Things at your Hands?</HI> And how shall those that are con∣verted, prize Christ as a Fountain, when the <HI>Glass</HI> that discovers their Blemishes is broken and cast away? Or how shall they live daily upon his Offices, without a Sight of their Need of them?</P>
<P>Nor is <HI>Ignorance</HI> of our Sins in Heart and Life, the Way to true and real Hu∣mility: For how shall those be discovered to us, without comparing our selves with that Law of God, of which Sin is a Trans∣gression?</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="005697_0238_1026C40C0FB78B58"/>And are we like to extol the Glory of pure pardoning Grace, while the Sins for∣given are hid from our View by rejecting the Law of God?</P>
<P>Is there any Perfection of the blessed God, more venerable and amiable than his Holiness? Of this the Seraphs shout with Joy and Transport, saying, <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of Hosts!</HI> And certainly a Gladness, and Satisfaction arises to the Saints on Earth in some degree from a View thereof. Now does it not tend to mar their Joy and Satisfaction in this At∣tribute, when the <HI>Law,</HI> that Image of the divine <HI>Purity</HI> is rejected? <HI>Surely in keeping God's Commands there is a great Re∣ward.</HI></P>
<P>If our <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> be not built upon a right <HI>Foundation,</HI> they are worse than none. And is the Foundation like to be well laid, while we are ignorant of our Sins thro' a Slight of the Law of God, the appointed Mean of Self-Knowledge?</P>
<P>Not to say that it is hard to conceive how any should be acquitted at the last
<PB N="239" REF="005697_0239_1026C3C673DC65D0"/>
Day, if that Law were destroy'd which is to be the Rule of Judgment.</P>
<P>From what has been said, considered complexly, methinks this Conclusion na∣turally and freely flows, <HI>viz.</HI> That the rejecting the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> directly tends to destroy all <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Vertue</HI> at one dreadful <HI>Stroak,</HI> and consequently, to plunge Mankind in a Deluge of Impiety, Confusion and Ruin? <HI>To the Law and to the Testimony</HI> (as the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> speaks) <HI>If they speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no Light in them.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. viii. 20.</NOTE> The Lord complains and threatens by the Prophet <HI>Ho∣sea</HI> in the following Language: <HI>My People are stroyed for lack of Knowledge. Because thou hast rejected Knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou shalt be no Priest to me: Seeing thou hast forgotten the Law of thy God, I will also forget thy Children.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Hos. 4.6.</NOTE> The Words of God by the Prophet <HI>Malachi</HI> are likewiie remarkable upon this Head: <HI>For the Priests Lips shall keep Knowledge, and they should seek the Law at his Mouth;
<PB N="240" REF="005697_0240_1026C40EC2476F60"/>
— But ye have departed out of the Way, ye have caused many to stumble at the Law, therefore have I made you also contemptible and base before all the People, according as ye have not kept my Ways, but have been partial in the Law.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. ii. 7, 8, 9.</NOTE> And our Lord him∣self in his Sermon on the Mount, after he had asserted, <HI>that he came not to destroy the Law,—and that not one Jot or Tittle shou'd pass from it till Heaven and Earth pass,</HI> he says, <HI>Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least Commandments, and shall teach Men so, he shall be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. x. 17, 18, 19.</NOTE> If it be objected against what has been spo∣ken upon this Subject, That the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> is a sufficient <HI>Rule</HI> without the Law, I answer: If Christ had sustain'd all the Characters or Relations that are among Men, for any considerable Space of Time, and all that he had said and done had been recorded; no doubt it would have been
<PB N="241" REF="005697_0241_1026C3C7F9258828"/>
a compleat Explication of the Law, and therefore, a perfect Directory for our Prac∣tice. But inasmuch as Jesus Christ did not sustain all Relations, had but a short abode in the World, and many Things he said and did are not recorded; ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fore his Life is not a sufficient Rule to us without the Law; neither do we find that it is any where recommended to us in Scripture as such. His Practice was entirely perfect and without Stain, and therefore so far as it is reveal'd to us, it is both our Honour, our Duty, and our Priviledge to imitate it, (excepting such extraordinary Cases that concern'd him peculiarly as Mediator) but what is not reveal'd we know not, and therefore cannot imitate.</P>
<P>Nor is it reasonable and safe for us to follow our <HI>Hearts</HI> as Rules or Guides, see∣ing they are by Nature <HI>deceitful and despe∣rately Wicked.</HI> And there are too much of the Remains thereof in the best of Men, which <HI>Paul</HI> bewail'd over in very moving Strains; saying, <HI>O wretched Man that I am, who shall deliver me from this Body of Sin and Death?</HI> And <HI>Peter</HI> was so far deceiv'd
<PB N="242" REF="005697_0242_1026C4131B60F4F8"/>
by it, as to dissuade his Lord from suffer∣ing! Yea all the Apostles were so sensible of it, that they <HI>groan'd within themselves, waiting for the Redemption of their Bodies!</HI> The Case being so, <HI>Solomon</HI> justly observes, that he <HI>who trusts in his Heart is a Fool,</HI> simple indeed in the worst Sense.</P>
<P>And to expect the Direction of God's Spirit, while we neglect or contemn the Means God has appointed for our Instruc∣tion, is great and dangerous <HI>Presumption; for all these Things God will be enquir'd of. i. e.</HI> apply'd to in the Use of proper Means. To follow immediate <HI>Impulses</HI> either wholly without the Scriptures, or without exa∣mining such Passages thereof as are brought to our Minds by the sober Use of our <HI>Reason,</HI> in comparing Scripture with Scrip∣ture, and considering the Consequences of different Interpretations, and their Agree∣ment with or Disagreement from the <HI>Analogy</HI> of Faith, exposes to all Manner of Inconsistency and Delusion: The De∣vil has hereby an awful Opportunity to betray us into the most perilous Principles, under the Appearance of an Angel of
<PB N="243" REF="005697_0243_1026C3CA78AF65F8"/>
Light, or guise of Truth and Good, and we have no Defensative: For without the humble Use of <HI>Reason,</HI> how can we try the Spirits by the Word, or have any just and consistent Apprehension of its meaning? In short by this Notion the Scriptures are rendered Useless to us in Effect; for its much alike whether we want the Scriptures altogether, or want the true Knowledge of them in <HI>Funda∣mentals:</HI> For it is by the Notion we have of the Meaning of the Scriptures that we are directed in Practice, and not by them considered absolutely. It's absurd to sup∣pose, that an infinitely Wise God would first give <HI>Reason</HI> to his Creatures, and then order them to cast it entirely away in or∣der to become Religious; that is, first to commence <HI>Beasts</HI> before they become Christians.</P>
<P>But some object against the <HI>Law,</HI> that Place of Scripture in the Epistle of <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> where it is said, <HI>That the Law is not of Faith.</HI> I answer with <HI>Turretine:</HI> <Q>That the Law is said not to be of Faith, not as it is taken largely for
<PB N="244" REF="005697_0244_1026C41631CC1BA0"/>
the whole <HI>Mosaick</HI> OEconomy, but strictly for the Moral Law abstracted and separated from the Promises of Grace, in which Sense the Self-righteous <HI>Jews</HI> understood it, who sought Life by it; for that Faith was commanded in the <HI>Sinai</HI> Covenant is evinc'd.</Q></P>
<P>Let us therefore, my dear Brethren! be entreated to esteem and value God's holy Law, whatever Contempt others cast upon it; let it be dear to us to the Death, more precious than fine Gold, and sweeter than Honey!</P>
<P>O Brethren! let us avoid with all Care and Caution, the <HI>Abuses</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> before mentioned; beware that ye depend not upon your Obedience to it for acceptance with God: And likewise take care that ye do not oppose Law and Gospel to each other, or advance the one to the others prejudice, for in so doing ye wound the Christian Religion, as well as your own Souls exceedingly! O there is a sweet Har∣mony between them, which we have rea∣son to admire and adore God for! And indeed the Thoughts and Knowledge of
<PB N="245" REF="005697_0245_1026C3CE8E615DB0"/>
this blessed <HI>Harmony</HI> and mutual Subser∣viency, tends to strengthen our Belief in the Divinity of the Christian Religion!</P>
<P>O ye unconverted Souls! use and apply the Law's Threatnings to alarm you out of your Iron Slumbers. Let the <HI>legal Lancet</HI> run into your secure Hearts and open your Wounds, that ye may be sick of Sin and flee to Jesus!</P>
<P>Surely it is Ignorance of God's Law that makes some despise it. If we may slight that, we may also the whole Old Testa∣ment with it, which is for the most part but an Explication thereof. And if the Old Testament be destroy'd, what shall become of the New that is built on that Foundation? Let us therefore study the Law, and pray to God that he wou'd shew us the Breadth of it, and wonders con∣tain'd in it.</P>
<P>Let the People of God be entreated to observe it as the Rule of their Practice. Obey it, dear Brethren! from a Principle of Love to God, and with an Eye to his Glory: And lean on Jesus by Faith, that
<PB N="246" REF="005697_0246_1026C3E6D95179D0"/>
for his sake your Imperfections may be pardon'd and your Acts of Obedience ac∣cepted; and thus ye may expect that Peace will be upon you and the <HI>Israel</HI> of God. Which may God grant for Christ's Sake. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PHILIP. ii. 12, 13.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling.</P>
<P>For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good Pleasure.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Design of <HI>Knowledge</HI> in Reli∣gion, my Brethren, is <HI>Practice;</HI> and without the latter, the former will only serve to encrease our present Guilt and future Punishment: <HI>To him that knoweth to do good, and doth it not, to him it is Sin.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Jam. iv. 17.</NOTE> <HI>And that Servant which knew his Lord's Will, and prepared not himself, neither did according to his Will, shall be beaten with many Stripes.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 47.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="005697_0249_1026C417B854C6C0"/>Nor have the People of God any Writ of Exemption from Obedience to their Creator and Father. It is so far from this, that they are under special Engagements thereto, by Reason of the distinguishing Expressions of God's Kindness towards them.</P>
<P>This the Text which I have chosen to discourse upon at present, represents in strong Terms: To understand which, let it be considered, that the Apostle therein ad∣dresses the Saints at <HI>Philippi,</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">i chap. 1 ver. <HI>Philipi,</HI> a City in <HI>Macedonia,</HI> on the Confines of <HI>Thracia,</HI> seated on a little Hill near the <HI>Pangean</HI> Mountain. <HI>Appia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></NOTE> and exhorts them to practical Holiness by divers Argu∣ments.</P>
<P>Having mentioned in the Preceeding Verses, the Obedience and Humiliation of Christ, together with the blessed Fruits thereof, he takes occasion from thence, to excite them to religious Diligence and humble Holiness. <HI>Let this Mind (i. e.</HI> humble Mind) <HI>be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus. Who being in the Form of God—took upon him the Form of a Ser∣vant
<PB N="251" REF="005697_0250_1026C46BB5D07570"/>
—and became obedient unto Death.— Wherefore God hath highly exalted him, and given him a Name above every Name.—</HI></P>
<P>It is as if the Apostle shou'd say, Seeing the blessed Jesus who is God over all, has, to purchase our Salvation, assum'd human Nature in its humblest Form, and became obedient therein to the Law to Death, and that of the most abasing and formidable Kind; ye shou'd be hence induc'd to use all Diligence, to get the purchas'd Salvati∣on apply'd really and satisfactorily to your own Souls at present, as well as to ob∣tain encreasing Meetness, for the full En∣joyment of it in the Life to come.</P>
<P>And to encourage them herein, the Apo∣stle not only uses an endearing Compellation in his Address, but prudently commends them for their past Diligence; <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Virtus laudata cres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cit,</HI> Vertue prais'd grows.</NOTE> <HI>Wherefore my beloved, as you have always obey'd, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence. Work out your own Salva∣tion.</HI> He excites them to persevering Obe∣dience to God's Law and Gospel, and es∣pecially
<PB N="252" REF="005697_0251_1026C41B1DC51FD0"/>
in his absence, that so it might ap∣pear to all, that not meerly a Reverence to their Pastor, but a prevailing Love to Christ and their own Souls constrain'd their Obedience; and likewise because in his Absence their Danger was encreas'd, thro' the Want of his Councils and the Presence of Seducers. <HI>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling. For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good Pleasure.</HI> These Words contain three Things worthy of Observation, <HI>viz.</HI> I. <HI>A Duty is enjoyned, Work.</HI> II. <HI>The Manner of performing it is prescrib'd, work out your own Salvation with fear and trem∣bling.</HI> And III. <HI>Arguments exciting hereto are mentioned; It is your own Salvation, and it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do, of his good Pleasure.</HI> I shall therefore in discoursing upon this Subject, endeavour to explain the aforesaid Particu∣lars, and then proceed to the Improvement.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Duty enjoyn'd, is pactical Holiness, or Obedience to God's Law.</HI> And hence the Apostle commends them for their Obedi∣ence,
<PB N="253" REF="005697_0252_1026C46D453B9D68"/>
in the first Part of the Verse; <HI>Where∣fore my Beloved, as ye have always obeyed.</HI>—</P>
<P>Here it may be enquir'd, what is requir'd to acceptable Obedience? (or good Works.)</P>
<P>I answer these four Things are necessary to constitute it; namely, a <HI>good Principle,</HI> a <HI>good End,</HI> a <HI>good Rule,</HI> and a <HI>good Mode.</HI> And</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> There must a <HI>good Principle, viz.</HI> a <HI>renew'd, believing Heart.</HI> And hence the Apostle observes to <HI>Timothy, That the End of the Commandment is Charity, out of a pure Heart, and of a good Conscience, and Faith unfeign'd.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. i. 5.</NOTE> And our Lord informs us, <HI>That a good Man out of the good Trea∣sure of his Heart, bringeth forth good Things: And an evil Man out of the evil Treasure, bringeth forth evil Things.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Matt. xii. 35.</NOTE> And that <HI>a corrupt Tree cannot bring forth good Fruit.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> But that <HI>whatsoever is born of the Flesh is Flesh.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">John iii.</NOTE> And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> informs us, <HI>That he that is in the Flesh cannot please
<PB N="254" REF="005697_0253_1026C41F747A95E8"/>
God.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 8.</NOTE> And that <HI>without Faith it is im∣possible to please him.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 6.</NOTE> Unless the Foun∣tain be good, the Streams cannot be so that proceed from it. The Salt of convert∣ing Grace must therefore be cast into the Spring of our Action, and as our Saviour directs us, <HI>we must make the Tree good, that the Fruit may be good.</HI> But</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> Another Thing that is necessa∣ry to constitute a good Work, is a <HI>good End,</HI> and that is the <HI>Glory</HI> of <HI>God:</HI> To this as our highest Mark or Scope, all our Actions, whether natural, civil or religious shou'd be directed; and to this, every Thing else shou'd be subordinated; <HI>Whe∣ther in eating or drinking, or whatsoever we do, we should do it all to the Glory of God.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 31.</NOTE> For the want of this, the Worship of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> tho' specious in appearance, was rejected. <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Mat. v. 20.</NOTE> In all religious Actions, we should more especially, actually intend God's Glory; for our aiming at the chief Good shou'd then be most express, and not interrupted by any other Intentions.
<PB N="255" REF="005697_0254_1026C473EF2A8A08"/>
But in civil and temporary Matters, it is not precisely necessary, that the Glory of God be always actually intended (tho' that shou'd be attempted as much as may be.) If in the mean time, the Glory of God be the virtual and general Scope, to which all our Works are referr'd. Our dear Re∣deemer lays much Stress upon the Sinceri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of our Intentions, and informs us, that <HI>our Eye be single our whole Body is full of Light,</HI> but if otherwise, <HI>full of Darkness: i. e.</HI> If in the Course of our Actions we do not aim at God's Glory above all, it is an Evidence of our being in a dark and dismal State towards God!</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly.</HI> A <HI>good Rule</HI> is likewise neces∣sary to constitute a good Work, or accept∣able Obedience. Now this <HI>Rule</HI> is the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> not <HI>ceremonial,</HI> which direct∣ed the Worship of the <HI>Jews,</HI> in Things peculiar to the Infant State of the Church, under that (comparatively) dark and terrible OEconomy. Forasmuch as that prefigured the Mediator to come, as the Shadow the Body, he being come it is abrogated. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 16, 17.</NOTE>
<PB N="256" REF="005697_0255_1026C42291169A70"/>
Nor is this Rule the <HI>Judicial Law,</HI> which directed the <HI>Jewish</HI> Commonwealth in ci∣vil Matters, forasmuch as that was in a great Measure peculiarly adapted to the political State and Circumstances of that Nation, which were in some respects singu∣lar, particularly considered as a <HI>Theocrasy,</HI> and under a ceremonious Dispensation, and was never given to the Gentile World as a Rule of Judgment, but to the <HI>Jewish,</HI> it necessarily follows, that it must expire with the Dissolution of the <HI>Jewish</HI> State. (at least so far as it peculiarly respected it) Nor are we under any formal Obligation to a Law, that was never impos'd upon us by divine Authority, or ever was adapted in many of its Stroaks to our Circumstances. The grand Design of the Scriptures, is not to suggest general Maxims of civil Policy, but Rules of holy Living. The Scope of the sacred Volumn is not to make us subtle <HI>Politicians,</HI> but sincere <HI>Christians;</HI> not to give us Rules of Judging about the Rights of Kings to their Crowns, but to direct us in the Way to a Crown of Life that shall never fade away.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="005697_0256_1026C47575E89150"/>It remains therefore, that it is the <HI>Moral Law</HI> that is the perpetual <HI>Rule</HI> of <HI>human Action;</HI> this therefore we must have in view in our sacred Service, and to this un∣alterable Scale of Holiness, we must strictly and invariably conform, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. iv. 2. Is. viii. 20. G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l. vi. 16.</NOTE> and without a Regard to this, in our Acts of Obedience, <HI>in vain do we worship God, teaching for Doctrines the Commandments of Men.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mat. xv. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Wherefore</HI> (says the Apostle to the <HI>Colo∣sians,) if ye be dead with Christ, from the Ru∣diments of the World; why—are ye sub∣ject to Ordinances; touch not, taste not, handle not, (which are to all perish with the using) after the Commandments and Doc∣trines of Men? Which Things have indeed a Shew of Wisdom, in will Worship, and Hu∣mility.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 20,—23.</NOTE> To all such, the Almighty God may propose the following silencing Ques∣tion; <HI>Who hath required this at your Hand?</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Is. i. 12.</NOTE></P>

<HI>i. e.</HI> It must not be only out∣wardly, but inwardly conformed to the Law of God, which is a spiritual Law, and requires Purity in the Thoughts and Dispositions of the Soul. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now <HI>Obedience</HI> to God's Law is call'd a <HI>Work</HI> in our Text, to signify its <HI>Difficulty,</HI> and the <HI>Pains</HI> that must be taken to per∣form it to purpose.</P>
<P>We have many Things to do, in relati∣on to God, our Neighbour and our selves; which to perform in their proper Season and order, in a constant and harmonious Series, is attended with no little Difficulty!</P>
<P>Yea the very Duties that respect our selves, are numerous and not of easy Per∣formance; to use all appointed Means with seriousness and steadiness, to obtain a <HI>Prin∣ciple</HI> of <HI>Grace, to pluck out our right Eyes, and cut off our right Arms: i. e.</HI> To for∣sake our darling Sins, which are to us, while unrenew'd, in respect of affection, like those Members of our Bodies. O how hard and Difficult is it!</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="005697_0258_1026C476FB96D260"/>And when converted, to continue in the steadfast and earnest Use of all instituted Means, in order to obtain the <HI>exercise</HI> of every <HI>Grace</HI> proper for all the various Occasions of Life, as well as to attain and retain the <HI>Growth</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> the <HI>Assu∣rance</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> and <HI>Perseverance</HI> therein to the End: and that contrary to the Ten∣dency of strong <HI>Corruptions</HI> from within, and innumerable <HI>Temptations</HI> from the De∣vil and World without. (<HI>i. e.</HI> both in re∣spect of the Objects of it, and the Men of it) is exceeding Difficult.</P>
<P>And it is peculiarly so to <HI>deny ourselves; to undo all</HI> that we have done amiss by repeated Acts of <HI>Penitence;</HI> to <HI>crucify</HI> our <HI>vicious Propensities;</HI> to maintain a humble <HI>Confidence</HI> in God; a transcendant <HI>Affection</HI> to him, and unfaling <HI>Complacence</HI> in him, in the Midst of Sins, of Sorrows and Temptations of various Forms: And hence it is that our Lord compares accept∣able Obedience or sincere Holiness to a <HI>straight Gate</HI> and <HI>narrow Way,</HI> and as∣sures us, that but few (<HI>i. e.</HI> comparatively) are possessors of it, <HI>Enter ye in at the
<PB N="260" REF="005697_0259_1026C4272C3B3E00"/>
strait Gate; for wide is the Gate, and broad is the Way that leadeth to Destruction, and many there be that go in thereat; because strait is the Gate, and narrow the Way that leadeth unto Life, and few there be that find it.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 13, 14.</NOTE> And elsewhere we are inform'd that <HI>the Righteous are scarcely (i. e.</HI> difficult∣ly) <HI>saved.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iv. 18. <HI>Molis.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Again it is call'd a <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Salvation,</HI> to shew us the <HI>Necessity</HI> of <HI>Obedience</HI> in or∣der to the Possession of Salvation in the future World, as well as the <HI>inseparable Connection,</HI> by Virtue of Divine Promise between <HI>Good Works</HI> or Holiness here and <HI>Happiness</HI> hereafter.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Word <HI>Salvation</HI> in Scrip∣ture intends no more but a <HI>Deliverance</HI> from some great <HI>Danger</HI> or Calamity: And thus when <HI>Israel</HI> were inviron'd round with inextricable Difficulties, the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Ar∣my behind them, and the <HI>Red Sea</HI> before them, and impervious Eminencies or im∣passible Mountains on each Side, <HI>Moses</HI> bid them <HI>stand still and see the Salvation of
<PB N="261" REF="005697_0260_1026C479F84C8D48"/>
God.</HI> But more generally the Word <HI>Sal∣vation,</HI> signifies a <HI>spiritual Deliverance</HI> from Sin, and the Miseries consequent upon it, begun by Grace here, and perfected in Glory hereafter. When our Lord visited <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> and conferr'd spiritual Mercy's upon him, he inform'd him, that <HI>that Day, Salvation came to his House: i. e.</HI> At that Time, a Right to Salvation was confer'd upon him by Justification, and the Begin∣nings of Salvation were implanted in him by Regeneration and Consolation. But the Word generally signifies the <HI>full Enjoyment</HI> of <HI>God</HI> in the Life to come; and in this Sense it is undoubtedly to be taken in our Text. <HI>Work out your own Salvation: i. e.</HI> diligently Study and faithfully Perform these Duties that relate to your eternal Salvation; that tend to clear up your Title to it, and make you meet for the Possession of it. This Phrase does in strong Terms represent, the Necessity and Usefulness of the good Works of the Faithful to promote their Salvation; and hence it is frequently represented to us as a <HI>Reward,</HI> which is not meeted out to us for our Works, but
<PB N="262" REF="005697_0261_1026C42B214C8170"/>
according to them; <HI>God will render to eve∣ry one according to his Works; to them who by patient Continuance in well-doing, seek for Glory and Immortality eternal Life.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. ii. 6, 7.</NOTE></P>
<P>But in vain do the <HI>Papists</HI> infer a <HI>Merit</HI> of <HI>Works</HI> from this Text! The good Works of the Saints, cannot deserve eternal Hap∣piness, for the following Reasons:</P>
<P N="1">1st. Because they are <HI>imperfect, all our Righteousnesses are as filthy Rags:</HI> Imper∣fection cleaves to the best of our Services, on which Account we need <HI>Forgiveness,</HI> as our Lord informs us in the Pattern of Prayer he has given us, and therefore can∣not merit any good at the Hand of God.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. Believers <HI>owe all</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> and there∣fore can merit nothing of him, by offering to him what is his own. They are God's <HI>Servants;</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke xvii. 10.</NOTE> <HI>they are not their own but bought with a Price:</HI> Now it is the Property of a <HI>Servant</HI> not to be <HI>Sui Juris,</HI> at his own Dispose or Command. They cannot dis∣pose of themselves or their Time, or their Work, because all these belong to their
<PB N="263" REF="005697_0262_1026C47D8B5250C0"/>
Master: And how then can they deserve any thing by doing what they are bound to do? And hence our Lord speaks to his Disciples in the following Words; <HI>Likewise when ye shall have done all these Things that are commanded you, say we are unprofitable Servants: WE HAVE DONE THAT WHICH WAS OUR DUTY TO DO.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke xvii. 10.</NOTE> If a <HI>Master</HI> rewards his Servant for doing his <HI>Duty,</HI> it must be pure Liberality and not Merit.</P>
<P>Besides, Believers receive all the Good they possess from God, <HI>It is God that work∣eth in them, to will and to do of his own good Pleasure, and they have nothing but what they have receiv'd.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Who hath first given to God and it shall be recompenced to him again?</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi. 35.</NOTE> The Case being so, they cannot possibly merit, by returning to God what is his own, for that is but an Act of Justice. Again</P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>Good Works</HI> are <HI>rewarded</HI> meerly out of God's <HI>Mercy</HI> and <HI>pure Grace,</HI> and therefore not of Merit, for these are opposed
<PB N="264" REF="005697_0263_1026C42E29AC26E0"/>
to each other; and hence we are told, that <HI>it is not by Works of Righteousness that we have done, but thro' his Mercy he hath saved us.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Tit. iii. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>Eternal Life</HI> is <HI>given</HI> to Believers, by Way of <HI>Inheritance,</HI> and therefore not by way of Merit; for the one is a Gift and the other is a Purchase; <HI>If Children then Heirs, Heirs of God and joynt Heirs with Christ.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 17.</NOTE> <HI>If the Inheritance be of the Law, it is no more of pro∣mise, but God gave it to</HI> Abraham <HI>by promise.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. xviii.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> If Salvation be confer'd for our Obedience to the Law, it is no more of Promise.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. The <HI>good Works</HI> of Believers are <HI>not equal</HI> in <HI>value</HI> to <HI>eternal Life,</HI> and therefore cannot diserve it; for <HI>I reckon</HI> (says the Apostle) <HI>that the Sufferings of this pre∣sent Time, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that shall be revealed in us.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. iii. 18.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now the Sufferings which the Saints of choice endure for Christ, are the best In∣stances
<PB N="265" REF="005697_0264_1026C47F11206E10"/>
of their Obedience; and therefore if those do not merit Happiness, far less their other Services. In order to demerit, there must be an Equality in Worth between the Work and the Reward; but the Re∣ward is infinite in Value and Duration, and our Works are both finite and imper∣fect; now between these there is no Pro∣portion of Equality, but on the contrary an infinite Disproportion.</P>
<P N="6">6thly. <HI>Eternal Life</HI> is the <HI>Gift</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and therefore not deserved by our Good Works; <HI>It is your Fathers good Pleasure to give you the Kingdom.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 32.</NOTE> <HI>The Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Sin is Death, but the Gift of God is eternal Life.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 23.</NOTE> Observe the Antithesis between the two; Death is inflicted in a way of Justice as the desert of Sin, as the Wages of a Hireling are due for his Work. But eter∣nal Life is the Gift of God, free and alto∣gether undeserved by us: Gift or Grace and Debt are certainly oppos'd; what we properly owe, we cannot be said properly to give, and so <HI>e contra.</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="266" REF="005697_0265_1026C43299644268"/>I may add, that seeing the Saints cannot do any thing that <HI>profits</HI> the <HI>Almighty,</HI> or <HI>recompence</HI> him for Benefits receiv'd, it is unreasonable to imagine that they should merit more; <HI>Our Goodness does not extend to God, neither is it any Gain to him that we are righteous.</HI> If a Son cannot return equal to his Father, for the Being he hath receiv'd instrumentally from him, how much less can he requite God, from whom he hath originally receiv'd his all?</P>
<P>And indeed the Papal Notion of <HI>Merit</HI> is <HI>Dishonourable,</HI> both to <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>Father</HI> and the <HI>Son!</HI></P>
<P>It eclipses the Fathers <HI>Liberality,</HI> and subjects him to his Creature. The greater any good is, the more communicative and liberal it is. Now he that gives freely, is more liberal than him that gives out of Debt or Desert.</P>
<P>And he that owes another, (according to Justice) is in some Measure subject to him; <HI>the Borrower</HI> (as <HI>Solomon</HI> observes) <HI>is Servant to the Lender.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxii. 7.</NOTE> And therefore
<PB N="267" REF="005697_0266_1026C481E1770828"/>
if the Almighty be a Debtor to fallen Man, on Account of any Merit in his Works, he would not act so freely as if no such Obligation lay upon him.</P>
<P>Nor can the <HI>Merits</HI> of <HI>Works</HI> be clear'd of derogating from the <HI>Redeemers Glory;</HI> for whoever merits any Thing, acquires a Right either in whole or in part to that which he had not before, and thus there wou'd be something in eternal Life which Christ had not merited, which is absurd in it self and inglorious to Christ! It is in vain to pretend that Christ hath purchas'd for his People a Power of meriting, for this is in other Words to say, that the Satis∣faction of Christ is incompleat, and that he needs the Help of others to perfect what he left unfinished! It is more for the Redeemers Honour to purchase all himself, than to enable others to do it, either in whole or in part: As he is more bountiful who gives another a large Inhe∣ritance out of his own proper Goods, than he that enables him to purchase an Estate by his Labour.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="005697_0267_1026C43468D95DF0"/>To <HI>work Salvation</HI> does not signify to <HI>effect it,</HI> but to labour about it, to do those things that have a Relation to it; and in this Sense the original Word is frequently taken in Scripture. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>adso.</HI> John vi. 27. 1 Cor. ix 13.

<P>But tho' from what has been said it ap∣pears, that the <HI>Popish</HI> Notion of the Merit of Works cannot be fairly inferr'd from these Words; yet they strongly assert the <HI>Necessity</HI> of <HI>good Works</HI> in order to <HI>Salva∣tion,</HI> against the <HI>Antinomians</HI> and <HI>Liber∣tines.</HI></P>

Relation to it of a <HI>Way</HI> to the <HI>End</HI> of a Journey, of the beginning of a Thing to its full <HI>Completion:</HI> For <HI>Grace</HI> is the beginning of <HI>Glory,</HI> as <HI>Glory</HI> is the <HI>Consumation</HI> of <HI>Grace.</HI> But to confirm and illustrate this important Point, let the following parti∣culars, respecting the necessity of <HI>Good Works,</HI> be duly weighed, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st. <HI>Good Works</HI> are <HI>Necessary,</HI> as the <HI>Way</HI> to the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> by di∣vine Appointment, tho' they are not the Cause of our reigning there, as <HI>Bernard</HI> excellently observes. And hence we are said <HI>to be his Workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto</HI> Good Works, <HI>which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephes. ii. 10.</NOTE> And elsewhere we are told, <HI>that without Holiness no Man shall see the Lord.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 14.</NOTE> Tho' eternal Blessedness be not strictly and properly a Reward, yet it is gi∣ven in some respect after the Manner of a Reward: Inasmuch as the Elect are not admitted to the Possession of it (ordi∣narily) till they have laboured for God,
<PB N="270" REF="005697_0269_1026C439D5A3A470"/>
nor are they treated as Conquerors, until they have fought <HI>Jehovah</HI>'s Battles, they must run the Race of Holiness before they possess the rest of the Crown of Happiness: And hence the Apostle informs the <HI>Thes∣salonians, that God from the Beginning chose them to Salvation thro' the Sanctifica∣tion of the Spirit and belief of the Truth.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Thes. ii. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2dly. <HI>Good Works,</HI> or Obedience to the Law of God, <HI>make us meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Col. i. 12.</NOTE> Besides a <HI>Right</HI> to the <HI>Inheritance,</HI> a <HI>Meetness</HI> to enjoy it, is also necessary, which consists in a Temper of Mind fitted for, or attemper'd to the Business and Enjoy∣ments of the heavenly State, without which they cannot make us Happy. Now this <HI>Temper</HI> of <HI>Mind,</HI> which is so necessary from the Nature of Things, in order to our Happiness, is <HI>Holiness</HI> in Heart; which is encreas'd by <HI>Good Works.</HI> The actual Exercise of Grace has a natural Tendency to enlarge and confirm the Principle of Grace as well as engages the
<PB N="271" REF="005697_0270_1026C4888082F758"/>
Promise of Divine Influence to that End: And hence the Almighty has told us by the Prophet <HI>Isaiah,</HI> that <HI>he will meet those that wait upon him in his Way, and work Righteousness.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. lxiv. 45.</NOTE> And elsewhere we are commanded <HI>to ask;</HI> and informed that in so doing, <HI>we shall receive.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 7.</NOTE> Doing Good is certainly the Way to grow better, we get Grace while we act it, the more we use our Limbs, the more nimble we grow; abounding in good Works, encreases the Principle from which they proceed, and so <HI>ripens</HI> us for <HI>Glory; Those that wait up∣on God shall renew their Strength.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isai. xl. 31.</NOTE> And tho' the blessed God is the principle Effi∣cient, in preparing us for future Blessedness, yet under him we act, and with him we concur, being <HI>drawn we run, and thro' his Spirit we mortify the Deeds of the Body, that we may live.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3dly. <HI>Good Works</HI> are <HI>necessary</HI> to <HI>evi∣dence</HI> our <HI>Faith,</HI> our <HI>Love</HI> our <HI>Sincerity;</HI> and hence is that notable Expression of the Apostle <HI>James, Shew me thy Faith without
<PB N="272" REF="005697_0271_1026C43B5A2AE5F8"/>
thy Works, and I will shew thee my Faith by my Works.</HI> Tho' Faith as it works does not justify, yet it is only a working Faith that does justify. That Faith is only of the right Stamp, that <HI>purifies the Heart and Works by Love.</HI> Now seeing <HI>Faith</HI> is the <HI>Root</HI> of <HI>good Works,</HI> by these Fruits therefore, we must <HI>discern</HI> the <HI>Tree</HI> from which they spring. Our Love is likewise hereby evidenc'd to be real, and not in Word and in Tongue only; <HI>If ye love me,</HI> (says our Lord) <HI>keep my Commandments.— And he that saith he loveth me, and keepeth not my Commandments, is a Lyer, and the Truth is not in him.</HI></P>
<P>And do not <HI>good Works</HI> make our <HI>Since∣rity evident,</HI> not only to others but to our selves? To this purpose <HI>Hezekiah</HI> mentions them, when he had received a Message of Death by the Prophet; <HI>I beseech thee, O Lord, remember now how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect Heart, and have done that which is good in thy Sight.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Kings xx. iii.</NOTE> Yea my Brethren, <HI>good Works</HI>

do <HI>evidence</HI> our <HI>eternal Election</HI> and <HI>effectu∣al Vocation;</HI> and hence we are enjoyn'd, <HI>to give Diligence to make our calling and Election sure,</HI> and inform'd, <HI>that if we do these Things we shall never fall, but have an abundant Entrance ministred to us, into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. i. 10, 11.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4thly. <HI>Good Works</HI> are <HI>necessary</HI> to <HI>glorify God,</HI> to <HI>imitate Christ,</HI> to <HI>Comfort our selves</HI> and <HI>edify our Neighbour; Herein</HI> (said the blessed Jesus) <HI>is my Father glorified, that ye bear much Fruit, so shall ye be my Dis∣ciples.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">John xv. 8.</NOTE> The more the Beauty of Grace appears, the more God is glorified; now it opens it Oriency and unfolds its Riches and Charms when it is exercised in good Works. Grace in the Creature, is but the Imitation of some divine Attribute in God to which it corresponds; and therefore the more we exercise it in Works of Piety and Charity, the more we manifest Jeho∣vah's Excellencies, or as the Apostle phras∣eth it, <HI>shew forth his Virtues.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Pet ii. 9. <HI>aretas.</HI></NOTE> And thence
<PB N="274" REF="005697_0273_1026C43E68288868"/>
it is evident, that good Works are the most effectual Way of glorifying God, because they offer the most convincing Demonstra∣tion of his adorable Excellencies to Men.</P>
<P>It is certainly our <HI>Duty</HI> as well as <HI>Pri∣viledge,</HI> to <HI>imitate</HI> the <HI>blessed Jesus;</HI> and hence we are commanded, <HI>so to walk even as he walked.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 John ii. 6.</NOTE> And he is said, <HI>to have left us an Example, that we should follow his Steps.</HI> Now Jesus Christ obey'd the Law, and therefore so must we, <HI>if we say we abide in him:</HI> The dear Redeemer was not only inherently, but actively holy, <HI>he went about doing good.</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>good Works</HI> promote our own <HI>Comfort</HI> exceedingly, and that not only as they are the Way, in which we can only expect, with Reason, the Fulfilment of God's gracious Promises towards us; but as they prevent much Guilt, which would be contracted by spiritual Sloth, and farther our Assurance of being in a gracious State! Surely <HI>to him that ordereth his Conversation aright, will be shewn the Salvation of
<PB N="275" REF="005697_0274_1026929707488850"/>
God.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm. l. 23.</NOTE> Negligence grieves the blessed Spirit, <HI>whereby we are sealed to the Day of Redemption;</HI> causes the Life of Grace to languish, and blots our Evidences for Heaven. But on the contrary, <HI>good Works,</HI> give a <HI>Spring</HI> to our <HI>Joy</HI> in God, by giving Evidence to the Sincerity of our Faith in him, as well as the Reality of our other Graces. Habits are known by their Act∣ings, and we judge of a Fountain by its Streams. Now it is the Knowledge of our Covenant Interest in God, that is the Source of Sweetness; the Comfort of a Believer ebbs and flows with that; and therefore those that desire the Comfort of Grace, must be diligent in the Exercise of Grace. I might add, that the <HI>Approbation</HI> of <HI>Con∣science</HI> in a <HI>Course</HI> of <HI>religious Labour,</HI> to∣gether with the grateful <HI>Gust,</HI> that attends the <HI>Exercise</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> therein, is no small Part of a Christians Delight, and therefore no inconsiderable Incentive to <HI>good Works.</HI></P>
<P>Again, my Brethren, our Neighbours <HI>Edification</HI> is <HI>promoted</HI> by <HI>good Works;</HI> and
<PB N="276" REF="005697_0275_1026C4414A08FC28"/>
hence our Lord enjoyns us, <HI>to let our Light so shine before Men, that they may see our good Works, and glorify our Father which is in Heaven.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. v. 16.</NOTE> And we are likewise bid <HI>to shine as Lights in the World, that those who seek to accuse our good Conversation in Christ, may be asham'd: i. e.</HI> Thro' their not finding just Matter of Accusation a∣gainst us. The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> exhorts Wives to the Performance of their Duty, <HI>that by their Conversation their Husbands may be won to Christ.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iii. 1.</NOTE> By these Instances it appears, that good Works have a noble Tendency to excite Men to glorify God, to silence Gainsayers, and to bring Men to Conversion.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. <HI>Good Works</HI> are <HI>pleasing</HI> to <HI>God; to do good and to communicate forget not, for with such Sacrifices God is well pleased.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heb xiii. 16.</NOTE> The Holy God delights in Holiness, and in those good Works which are the proper Fruits of it; hence is that of the Psalmist, <HI>the righteous Lord loveth Righteousness, his Countenance beholdeth the upright.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Ps. xi. 7.</NOTE> God

delights first in himself, and next in his nearest Resemblance, which is Holiness. Good Works come from God, and there∣fore no Wonder he Delights in them!</P>
<P>Having spoken upon the Duty enjoyn'd in our Text, I proceed to Discourse <HI>upon the Manner</HI> of performing <HI>it therein pre∣scrb'd,</HI> which is the</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>General Head.</HI> Now we should per∣form the Duties of Obedience required of us.</P>
<P N="1">1st. <HI>Painfully</HI> and <HI>Earnestly:</HI> This is doubtless intended by the Word <HI>Work;</HI> and hence we are commanded in other Places of Scripture, <HI>to strive to enter in at the strait Gate;</HI> and inform'd, <HI>that many shall seek to enter in but shall not be able.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xiii. 24.</NOTE> The original Word signifies to agonize: <HI>i. e.</HI> to labour as in an Agony. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Agonidsz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sthe.</NOTE> We are likewise commanded, to <HI>run so that we may obtain.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ix. 24.</NOTE> <HI>So to fight that we may lay hold on eternal Life.</HI> <NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 12.</NOTE> <HI>So to wrestle, that we may be able to stand.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Ephs. vi. 11, 12.</NOTE> And we are

Pray is there any Need to caution us against <HI>fainting, and growing weary in well doing,</HI> if we have no Work to do at all?</P>

<P>But the Time requires that I shou'd pro∣ceed to some Improvement from what has been spoken. And</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> From hence we may learn, the <HI>Falsehood</HI> and <HI>Danger</HI> of the <HI>Popish Doctrine</HI> of a <HI>Merit in Works</HI> on the one Hand, as
<PB N="281" REF="005697_0280_1026C4955BE97648"/>
well as of the <HI>Antinomian Doctrine</HI> on the other, which casts <HI>contempt</HI> upon <HI>good Works,</HI> and represents Obedience to the Law as unnecessary.</P>
<P>Both these <HI>Doctrines</HI> are equally unrea∣sonable in themselves, <HI>dishonourable</HI> to God, and <HI>detrimental</HI> to us. <HI>Those who being ig∣norant of the Righteousness of God, and go about to establish their own,</HI> rebel against the Government and Righteousness of Christ, and rob him of his mediatorial <HI>Crown</HI> and <HI>Dignity. Such who seek after Righteousness, as it were by the Works of the Law, shall not attain it: i. e.</HI> Such who think to deserve Good at the Hand of God by their Works, or (while uncon∣verted) thereby to ascertain their Salvation in regard of the Promise of God, they build the Fabrick of Happiness upon their own Righteousness, and so turn their Backs on Christ and trample upon his Merit, without which there is no Salvation!</P>
<P>And those likewise do as great Dishonour to God, who run into the contrary Ex∣treme, and imagine that God by his Gos∣pel and Grace, has freed us from Obli∣gations
<PB N="282" REF="005697_0281_1026C450B765B3A0"/>
to obey his Law as a Rule of Prac∣tice. This is to turn the Grace of God into Wantonness, and make the <HI>Gospel</HI> a <HI>Pillow</HI> to <HI>Sloth</HI> and <HI>Laziness,</HI> a <HI>Mystery</HI> of <HI>Iniquity,</HI> Rebellion and Mischief, unwor∣thy to be receiv'd by any reasonable Crea∣ture! Those who do not seek, are never like to find; those that strive not, shall not enter into the strait Gate; those who work not, are not like to obtain the Reward; those who run not, cannot with reason ex∣pect the Rest prepar'd for the People of God; <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven suffers</HI> Vio∣lence, <HI>and it is the Violent, (and none but they,) that take it by Force. Know ye not, that the Unrighteous shall not inherit the Kingdom of God. Be not deceiv'd, neither Fornicators, nor Idolaters, nor Adulterers, nor Effeminate, nor Abusers of themselves with Mankind, nor Thieves, nor Covetous, nor Drunkards, nor Revilers, nor Extor∣tioners, shall Inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>The proud <HI>Pharisee</HI> that depends on his Works, and the <HI>lazy Libertine,</HI> that ne∣glects them, are like to dwell together in the same Hell; <HI>Those that compass themselves
<PB N="283" REF="005697_0282_1026C49828C0A1E8"/>

<P>Truth and Duty lie in the midle between these two Extremes. O therefore! let us be careful, lest while we labour to avoid the one, we run into the other. But</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> I may take occasion, my Bre∣thren, from what has been said, to enquire of you, what is your Case and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ourse? Are you at <HI>Work</HI> about your <HI>Salvation,</HI> or are you <HI>idle?</HI> Are you <HI>asking who shall shew you any</HI> (temporal) <HI>good?</HI> Or are ye <HI>enquir∣ing the Way to</HI> Zion, <HI>with your Faces thi∣therward, weeping as ye go?</HI> O! is this your anxious Enquiry, <HI>Men and Brethren, what shall we do to be saved?</HI> I would to God that this were the Case of all of you that are unconverted.

<P>If your Works have the aforesaid Ingre∣dients, give to God the <HI>Glory</HI> of his <HI>Grace</HI> vouchsafed upon you; for <HI>who has made you to differ from others, and what have ye that ye have not received?

<P>Don't imagine, my Brethren, that your <HI>Work</HI> is over when you are <HI>converted,</HI> and that you have then nothing to do, but to sport and play, like the <HI>Leviathan</HI> in the Waters, or to sing like the indolent <HI>Gras∣hoper</HI> upon the Land, who spends the sum∣mer Season in careless, fruitless Singing one Kind of Song, till it meets unprepar'd, the Winter cold; <HI>go to the Ant thou Slugard, consider her Ways and be wise; which hav∣ing no Guide, Overseer or Ruler, provideth her Meat in the Summer, and gathereth her Food in the Harvest.</HI></P>

<P>Tho' your Work be great, my Brethren, yet your <HI>Support</HI> therein is great also, your <HI>Success</HI> sure, and the <HI>Crown</HI> before you <HI>immortal</HI> and <HI>glorious!</HI></P>
<P>It is true, of our selves we are very <HI>Weak,</HI> and not able to <HI>think,</HI> much less to Will or do Good: But in CHRIST we are <HI>Strong, thro' him we can do all Things;</HI> and he it is that <HI>works in us both to will and to do of his own Good Pleasure:</HI> And in∣deed <HI>when we are Weak, then are we Strong,</HI> i. e. when we are most sensible of our own Weakness, then do we receive most Strength from him.</P>

So that as long as the Head lives, the Members cannot dye (spiritually): And hence is that precious saying of our dearest LORD to his Desciples; <HI>Because I live, ye shall live also; while the ungodly walk in a vain shew, and vex themselves in vain; while they Labour in the Fire, and weary themselves for very Vani∣ty.</HI> While they are cross'd with a Succes∣sion of Disappointments, and grasp after a <HI>Dream,</HI> a <HI>Shadow,</HI> which often flies from their Embraces; and if obtain'd disappoints their Hopes, and does but <HI>whet</HI> instead of satisfying their Desires!

<P>My Friends, it is no small MERCY that ye are under a <HI>Command</HI> to <HI>labour</HI> for SAL∣VATION, and that there is any Encourage∣ment given by GOD of obtaining it in this Way.</P>
<P>To be WITHOUT LAW and COM∣MANDS, is the unhappy PRIVILEDGE of the DEVILS and DAMNED SPIRITS, inasmuch as GOD intends no MERCY for
<PB N="303" REF="005697_0302_1026C4B3B2958620"/>
them he neither requires or receives any DUTY of them!</P>
<P>O if the Almighty did send a Message of Mercy to those forlorn Spirits, intimat∣ing that in the Way of OBEDIENCE, or <HI>working</HI> for their SALVATION, there was not only a <HI>Possibility</HI> but a <HI>Probability</HI> of obtaining LIFE and BLESS; there would be a joyful JUBILIE among the DAMN∣ED! All Hell wou'd rejoyce, and every Inhabitant of that dark abode, wou'd with gladness shake the massey <HI>Shackles</HI> with which it is bound! Yea it is probable, they would stoop to the severest Service to obtain that Happiness which they feel so much the Want of, and which you now so basely slight!</P>
<P>Do you grumble at the Strictness of the Law, and want to be freed from it as a Rule of Duty? a <HI>Rule</HI> which all the <HI>Choirs</HI> above, both of <HI>Saints</HI> and <HI>Seraphims</HI> with <HI>Delight obey,</HI> and shall be under (in respect of all its Stroaks that respect pure unem∣bodied Spirits) to all Eternity.

<P>Well if it will be any Comfort to you, I must inform you, that you may have this <HI>Lust</HI> gratify'd in <HI>Hell:</HI> There the damned are freed from this dreadful LAW which you count so heavy a YOKE: There the Almighty requires no more DUTY, no LOVE, no OBEDIENCE, no REPEN∣TANCE: If you count this a <HI>Priviledge</HI> I shall not envy your <HI>Happiness,</HI> but pity your <HI>Infatuation!</HI> and pray to be deliver'd from your lawless Comfort, and kept eter∣nally under the <HI>Law</HI> to God!</P>

<P>Again Brethren, consider that the Soul of Man is a <HI>restless, active Being,</HI> that it will be painful in its chase of something, and cannot be at rest, so that it is but turning its Motions into a religious Channel, and then its like to have a happy Issue!</P>
<P>And now, Sirs, will ye, can ye, dare ye be idle after all?—Well, I must leave the Matter to God, and appeal to him, that I am clear of your <HI>Blood,</HI> if you per∣sist in your <HI>Indolence!</HI></P>
<P>But perhaps, some poor Sinners Heart thaws by this Time, and asks with seri∣ousness, <HI>what shall I do to be saved?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="005697_0307_1026C506C0A72CE0"/>Besides what has been already said in answer to this Question, I would add at present these few Words: <HI>Labour orderly,</HI> begin at the right End of your Work, and try to lay the <HI>Foundation</HI> first: <HI>Examine</HI> your <HI>State</HI> towards God impartially, by his Word, and when you come to know that it is bad, <HI>think</HI> often on the <HI>Badness</HI> and <HI>Miseries</HI> of it, and pray for a Sense of them, as well as of your utter inability to deliver your selves from them; <HI>Repent of your Sins</HI> and <HI>believe in the Lord Jesus;</HI> and O be∣ware of <HI>quenching</HI> the convincing Operati∣ons of his <HI>Holy Spirit!</HI></P>
<P>But I must turn me to the <HI>Saints</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and offer a Word of <HI>Council</HI> and <HI>Excite∣ment</HI> to them, and then conclude. My very dear Brethren! Be not lifted up with <HI>Enlargements,</HI> nor cast down when ye want them; <HI>Consolation</HI> is no Part of our <HI>Sancti∣fication,</HI> you may travel when its <HI>Cloudy,</HI> as well as when the <HI>Sun shines</HI> out. Be <HI>humbled</HI> for your Imperfections, but not <HI>discourag'd</HI> by them, <HI>for ye are compleat in Christ,</HI> and your <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>Happiness</HI> is founded alone upon his <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Obedi∣ence,</HI>
<PB N="309" REF="005697_0308_1026C4BAC036D710"/>
by all means encourage your <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Promises, lean</HI> on <HI>Jesus</HI> as a <HI>Prophet,</HI> for Direction respecting the <HI>Matter</HI> of your <HI>Labours, lean</HI> on him as a <HI>King</HI> to help you in the <HI>Manner</HI> of <HI>them,</HI> and <HI>lean</HI> on him as a <HI>Priest</HI> for the <HI>Acceptance</HI> of them all.</P>
<P>Dear Brethren! Be excited to <HI>persever∣ing Diligence,</HI> for it is as <HI>reasonable</HI> and <HI>amiable</HI> now, as when ye at first believ'd.

<HEAD>SERMON II.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PHILIP. ii. 12, 13.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling.</P>
<P>For it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good Pleasure.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>MY Brethren! The three principal Things in the Christian <HI>Religion,</HI> are <HI>Knowledge, Faith</HI> and <HI>Prac∣tice,</HI> without which it cannot subsist.</P>
<P>The <HI>Object</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> the <HI>blessed God,</HI> is to be known and believ'd in as the first <HI>Truth, lov'd</HI> as the <HI>chief Good,</HI> and <HI>obey'd</HI> as the <HI>supreme Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Subject</HI> of <HI>Religion, Man,</HI> must have his <HI>Mind enlightned</HI> with the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of <HI>Truth,</HI> his <HI>Will adorn'd</HI> with the <HI>Belief</HI> of it, and <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Good,</HI> as well as his <HI>Life beautified</HI> with <HI>practical Holiness,</HI> or <HI>good Works.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="312" REF="005697_0311_1026C50B07A65FC0"/>The very <HI>Essence</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> requires or includes <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> and therefore it is frequently represented in Scripture under the Character of <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Truth,</HI> and eternal Life is ascrib'd to it.</P>
<P>And the <HI>End</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> namely <HI>Hap∣piness,</HI> includes the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of <HI>God, Faith</HI> in <HI>him,</HI> and <HI>Conformity</HI> to <HI>him,</HI> or <HI>Obedience.</HI> In <HI>Heaven</HI> the <HI>Saints</HI> will <HI>see Jehovah as he is, and be like him;</HI> there <HI>Knowledge, Faith</HI> and <HI>Obedience</HI> will be <HI>perfect.</HI></P>
<P>The sacred Scriptures propose to us <HI>Doctrines</HI> to be <HI>known, Promises</HI> and <HI>Threatnings</HI> to be <HI>believ'd,</HI> and <HI>Precepts</HI> to be obey'd; and indeed the one prepares the Way for the other.</P>
<P>Without <HI>Knowledge, Faith</HI> is <HI>enthusiasti∣cal Rashness</HI> and <HI>Delusion,</HI> and without <HI>Faith, Knowledge</HI> is but <HI>barren Speculation;</HI> without <HI>Knowledge, Practice</HI> is <HI>blind Super∣stition,</HI> and without <HI>Faith, formal Devoti∣on!</HI></P>
<P>It is the last of the Three that I am to discourse upon at present, namely, <HI>Practice,</HI>
<PB N="313" REF="005697_0312_1026C4C0A2275CC8"/>
or <HI>Good</HI> Works, which are indeed the <HI>Fruit</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> of the former.</P>
<P>In the preceeding <HI>Sermon,</HI> after an In∣troduction, I observ'd, that there be three Things contain'd in the Text, <HI>viz.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>A Duty enjoyn'd.</HI>—</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>The Manner of performing it pre∣scrib'd.</HI> And</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. <HI>Arguments exciting thereto mentioned.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>These Things I propos'd to <HI>insist upon</HI> in their <HI>Order,</HI> by Way of <HI>Explication,</HI> and then to proceed to the <HI>Improvement.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>first General Head</HI> of this Method I then spoke upon, and labour'd to open the <HI>Properties</HI> of <HI>Good Works,</HI> as well as to <HI>unhinge</HI> the <HI>Popish Doctrine</HI> of <HI>Merit</HI> upon the one hand, and to <HI>establish</HI> the <HI>Necessity</HI> of <HI>good Works</HI> on the other, against the <HI>Antinomians.</HI> I likewise spoke a little up∣on the</P>
<P><HI>Second General Head,</HI> Which was to shew, <HI>how the Duties of Obedience, or Good Works, shou'd be perform'd.</HI> In speaking upon which, I mentioned two Particulars, name∣ly, that they shou'd be perform'd, <HI>pain∣fully</HI>
<PB N="314" REF="005697_0313_1026C50D0F0F1270"/>
and <HI>perseveringly.</HI> I therefore pro∣ceed now to observe,</P>
<P N="3">III. That we must work <HI>with fear and trembling,</HI> by which we are not to under∣stand, <HI>a slavish Fear, or distrust of God,</HI> For this is very prejudicial to our Progress in Piety, it provokes our God, dejects our Minds, and mars our Councils and Per∣formances. It is doubtless, therefore, more generally, a <HI>filial</HI> or child-like <HI>Fear,</HI> that is here recommended to the People of God: And particularly, (1st) It is a <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Reverence</HI> respecting <HI>God's Majesty, Where∣fore we receiving a Kingdom which cannot be moved, let us have Grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably, with Reverence and godly Fear, FOR OUR GOD IS A CONSUMING FIRE.</HI> A holy <HI>Awe</HI> of the <HI>Greatness, Justice</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> should ever possess our Minds. (2dly) In relation to <HI>our selves,</HI> it is a <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Modesty, Humility, Self-suspicion</HI> and <HI>Self-diffidence; the same humble Mind should be in us, which was also in Christ Jesus:</HI> The Apos∣tle <HI>Paul</HI> was among the <HI>Corinthians in weakness, and in fear, and in much tremb∣ling.</HI>
<PB N="315" REF="005697_0314_1026C4C4C2238028"/>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Let us therefore fear, lest a Pro∣mise being left us of entring into his Rest, any of you shou'd seem to come short of it.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. iv 1.</NOTE> <HI>Be not high Minded but fear.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. xi. 20.</NOTE> (3dly) In <HI>Relation</HI> to the <HI>Dangers</HI> with which we are environ'd, it is a <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Sollicitude;</HI> and hence <HI>Paul</HI> informs us, <HI>that he kept his Body under, least having preach'd to others, he himself should become a cast-away.</HI> We should in Dangers distrust ourselves, and with anxious Care and eager haste, fly to Jesus, as the only <HI>hiding Place from the Wind, and covert from the Tempest,</HI> firmly trusting in him, and closely cleaving to him, as the Child in the Mother's Arms on the top of a Precipice; so much the more as it fears a Fall, will, with the greater eager∣ness and sollicitude, embrace and cleave to its Parent for Protection from the im∣minent Danger. (4thly) In respect of <HI>Temp∣tations,</HI> it is a <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Caution,</HI> disposing us to <HI>avoid the Appearances of Evil; and to pray that we be not led into Temptation.</HI> The gracious Soul fearing to offend his
<PB N="316" REF="005697_0315_1026C51485127258"/>
Father, and knowing his own Weakness, to withstand Temptations to Error in Principle or Practice, does therefore in his general Course endeavour with care to a∣void them: The burnt Child dreads the Fire, but Hypocrites not having sincere Love to Truth or Holiness, and presuming upon their own Strength, are prophanely bold, to the Roproach of God's Name, and their own Dishonour and Prejudice. If we shou'd be <HI>jealous</HI> over others, (with blessed <HI>Paul) and fear least by any Means, as the Serpent beguiled</HI> Eve <HI>through his Subtilty, so their Minds should be corrupted from the Simpli∣city that is in Christ;</HI> we should have a <HI>godly Jealousy</HI> over our selves much more, for Charity begins at Home, tho' it shou'd not end there. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xi. 23</NOTE></P>
<P>The <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>God</HI> is certainly the <HI>Cha∣racter</HI> of a truly religious Person; and hence <HI>Job</HI> is describ'd, to be one that <HI>feared God, and eschewed Evil.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Job <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> Indeed it is the Foundation of all Religion.</P>
<P>Now a gracious Person does not only
<PB N="317" REF="005697_0316_1026C4C64C84A6A0"/>
fear the <HI>Goodness</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hos. iii. 5.</NOTE> least he shou'd displease and loose it by unworthy Behavi∣our; and hence we are bid to <HI>keep our selves in the Love of God;</HI> and indeed the Use of Means to this End is very con∣sistent with God's Promises. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxvi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7.</NOTE> <Q>Fear (saith <HI>Augustine</HI>) is the Flight of the Soul least it shou'd loose what it l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ves.</Q> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Fuga Anime ne perdat quod Diligit.</NOTE> The dutiful Child fears to offend its Parents, and the chaste <HI>Wife</HI> fears to displease her Husband.</P>
<P>I say, the gracious Person does not only fear God's <HI>Goodness,</HI> but his <HI>Justice;</HI> the <HI>Threatnings</HI> of the divine Word, should, and do influence his <HI>Fear.</HI></P>
<P>The infinitely wise God has implanted no <HI>Power</HI> or <HI>Passion</HI> in the human Soul <HI>in vain,</HI> they all serve when regulated in their Motions and Tendencies, one uniform, noble Design, worthy of their <HI>Author</HI> and <HI>original Situation.</HI></P>
<P>And this is indeed the grand Design of the Christian Religion, which is admirably
<PB N="318" REF="005697_0317_1026C51608600EE8"/>
adapted to affect every of them; this by its <HI>Precepts</HI> fires our <HI>Love;</HI> by its <HI>Doctrines, Naratives</HI> and <HI>Proposals,</HI> it strikes our <HI>Ad∣miration</HI> and <HI>Ingenuity,</HI> our <HI>Gratitude</HI> and <HI>Grief.</HI> By its <HI>Threatnings</HI> it alarms our <HI>Fear,</HI> and by its <HI>Promises</HI> allures our <HI>Hope,</HI> those cardinal Springs of Action!</P>
<P>Jehovah never devis'd a Religion, to de∣stroy any Power or Passion he himself had form'd, but only to direct them to proper Objects, and regulate their Degrees of Mo∣tion; which being observ'd, they conspire in harmony to promote God's Glory, and the Creature's Honour, Comfort and Bene∣fit in his Service.</P>
<P>Every <HI>Affection</HI> shou'd therefore be ex∣ercis'd upon its proper Object, as the <HI>Love</HI> of God is the <HI>incentive</HI> of our <HI>Love,</HI> so is his <HI>Justice</HI> (together with the Threatnings of his Word which are the Declarations thereof) the <HI>Object</HI> of our <HI>Fear.</HI> By these (in part) the Spirit of God as a Spirit of Bondage to fear, brings the Soul to a Clo∣sure with Christ at first, and by these Threatnings it is afterwards influenc'd (in part) to walk in the Way to Blessedness.</P>

<P><HI>Faith</HI> produces <HI>Fear,</HI> and <HI>Fear</HI> confirms <HI>Faith; By Faith</HI> Noah <HI>being warn'd of God, of things not seen as yet, mov'd with fear, prepar'd an Ark.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 7</NOTE> <HI>All Men shall fear</HI> (saith the Psalmist) <HI>and trust in him.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxiv. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Faith</HI> by giving the Soul a View of God's <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Holiness,</HI> produces a <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Reverence,</HI> and this disposes the Soul the more to believe the certainty of God's <HI>Judgments!</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>Love</HI> without <HI>Fear,</HI> would become <HI>secure</HI> and <HI>irreverent,</HI> and <HI>Fear</HI> without <HI>Love</HI> would become <HI>slavish</HI> and <HI>tormenting!</HI> There is nothing more fearful than an in∣genuous Love, and nothing more loving than a filial <HI>Fear.</HI></P>

But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all manner of Conversation.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Follow Peace with all Men, and Holiness, without which no Man shall

But when this is refus'd, a rebellious unequal War is commenc'd a∣gainst Heaven.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly:</HI> It is a <HI>Work of Salvation; Work out your own Salvation;</HI> and therefore its an <HI>honourable, pleasant</HI> and <HI>profitable Work.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Work</HI> of SALVATION is <HI>honoura∣ble,</HI> in respect of its <HI>Author, Nature</HI> and <HI>Consequences.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Author</HI> of this <HI>Work</HI> is <HI>honoura∣ble,</HI>
<PB N="323" REF="005697_0322_1026C4D1F67CE9E0"/>
no other than the <HI>glorious God;</HI> he it is that has enjoyn'd it, and him we serve in the Performance of it. It's accounted an Honour to attend the Person of an earthly <HI>Potentate,</HI> but herein we attend the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Lord</HI> of <HI>Lords,</HI> and that as feated on his gracious <HI>Throne,</HI> and have therein the noblest <HI>Seraphs</HI> for our <HI>Companions.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed the <HI>Nature</HI> of this <HI>Work</HI> is <HI>honourable,</HI> tending to enoble our <HI>reasonable Nature,</HI> by <HI>conforming</HI> it to the <HI>Divine.</HI> Are not the pious Dispositions and Actions we are called to, the very same for Sub∣stance that the Angels are continually em∣ploy'd about? The Nature of the Service enjoyned upon us is <HI>spiritual, pure</HI> and <HI>pre∣cious.</HI> Besides the <HI>Consequence</HI> hereof is <HI>honourable;</HI> for thus we are not only the <HI>Servants</HI> but the <HI>Friends</HI> of <HI>God; ye are my Friends,</HI> said the blessed Jesus to his Dis∣ciples, <HI>if you do whatsoever I command you.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xv. 14.</NOTE> And is any Title more honourable than this, to be the Friend of God? This was
<PB N="324" REF="005697_0323_1026C5194DAEBB38"/>
the Honour to which the blessed <HI>Abraham</HI> was advanc'd, and with which he was adorn'd.</P>
<P>Again, my Brethren, the <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Sal∣vation</HI> is a <HI>pleasant Work; Wisdoms Ways are Ways of pleasantness, and all its Paths are peace.</HI> The Psalmist speaking of the <HI>Commands</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> declares, <HI>that they are sweeter than Honey, and the Honeycomb.</HI> And what can be intended by this, but that they are <HI>lovely</HI> in <HI>themselves,</HI> and that <HI>Obedience</HI> to them is <HI>delightful?</HI></P>
<P>Now this Delight in Obedience, springs in part from the Suitableness thereof to the <HI>New Nature</HI> that is in gracious Persons, which gives a spiritual and general Byass to all the <HI>Powers</HI> of their <HI>Souls;</HI> and there∣fore cannot but make <HI>(holy)</HI> Actions, which are agreeable to that fix'd Principle, easy and pleasant, especially when Grace is in exercise. It is on this Account our Lord assures us, <HI>that his Yoke is easy, and his Burden is light.</HI> He does not make his Yoke easy by lessening it, but by conforming our Dispositions to it. And hence the A∣postle informs us that he <HI>delighted in the
<PB N="325" REF="005697_0324_1026C4D63A049D88"/>
Law of God, after the inner Man: i. e.</HI> So far as he was renewed he loved it, and was naturally enclin'd to obey it, and therefore delighted therein. The <HI>new Na∣ture</HI> is as prone to obey the <HI>Law,</HI> as a Fountain to send out its Streams; and therefore its compar'd to a <HI>Well of Water, that springs up to eternal Life.</HI> But be∣cause our Sanctification is imperfect, there∣fore the <HI>Flesh lusts against the Spirit,</HI> and hin∣ders us in Acts of Obedience, <HI>so that we cannot do the Things that we would.</HI> And thus our sacred Service is stain'd, our Peace broken at Times, and our Pleasure mar'd. <HI>But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.</HI></P>
<P>But the Delight in Obedience, likewise results from that Communion with God which is enjoyn'd therein; this gives <HI>rest to the weary Soul,</HI> and is as <HI>Marrow and Fatness to the Hungry,</HI> yea it is the very Life of Life. The blessed God <HI>meets</HI> in mercy <HI>those that work Righteousness,</HI> and gives them Communications of <HI>Light,</HI> of <HI>Love,</HI> of <HI>Peace,</HI> of <HI>Joy;</HI> and hence the Psalmist observes, that <HI>those have great

Peace, that love God's Law.</HI>—And <HI>that in keeping his Commandments there is a great Reward.—This is our rejoycing,</HI> says the Apostle <HI>Paul, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleshly Wisdom, we have had our Conversation in the World.</HI></P>
<P>And is not the <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Salvation profit∣able,</HI> my Brethren? Yes surely! For <HI>God∣liness hath not only the Promise of this Life, but of that which is to come.</HI> If we <HI>seek first the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Righ∣teousness thereof, all other Things shall be added to us,</HI> says our dear Redeemer: <HI>i. e.</HI> We shall have that Measure of the Things of Time, and that Degree of Comfort in them, which is most for God's Glory and our Benefit. And can we reasonably desire more? But our Reward of Mercy, is prin∣cipally to be expected in a future World; there, there, our Salvation shall be com∣pleat and perfect. Now there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re three <HI>Properties</HI> of that <HI>Salvation,</HI> in the Expec∣tation of which we labour, that may justly incite our Diligence, <HI>viz.</HI> it is <HI>great, in∣comprehensible eternal.</HI></P>
<P>It is a <HI>great Salvation,</HI> not only in res∣pect
<PB N="327" REF="005697_0326_1026C4D7C5CA77B8"/>
of the <HI>Price</HI> which was laid down to purchase it, the <HI>Blood</HI> of the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> but also in respect of the <HI>Evils</HI> we are thereby <HI>delivered from,</HI> and the <HI>Blessings</HI> we are <HI>instated in.</HI> There is a perfect Free∣dom from all <HI>moral</HI> and <HI>penal Evil,</HI> from Sin and all the gloomy Train of Miseries introduc'd by it, which affect our <HI>Names, Bodies, Estates</HI> and our <HI>Souls.</HI> In Heaven there is a perfect <HI>Rest</HI> prepar'd from them all! There we shall be freed from every Remain of <HI>Evil,</HI> and <HI>all Tears shall be wip'd away.</HI></P>
<P>And on the other Hand, how great are the <HI>Blessings</HI> that are there possess'd? Such as an <HI>immediate Vision</HI> of the <HI>blessed God,</HI> a <HI>perfect Conformity to him,</HI> an <HI>uninterrupted Communion with him,</HI> and <HI>unceasing Joy</HI> and <HI>Praise</HI> thence issuing! Then the glorify'd shall <HI>see Jehovah as he is,</HI> and <HI>be made like to him</HI> in Purity and Perfection! O the pleasing Transports that must result from an immediate View of the unvail'd <HI>Beauties</HI> of the Deity! The orient <HI>Glories</HI> of IM∣MANUEL, and all the open'd <HI>Charms</HI> of
<PB N="328" REF="005697_0327_1026C52088C58390"/>
his <HI>Word,</HI> and <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Creation, Redemp∣tion,</HI> and <HI>Providence.</HI></P>
<P>Another <HI>Property</HI> of this <HI>Salvation</HI> is, that it is <HI>incomprehensible; Eye hath not seen, neither has Ear heard, nor has it entred in∣to the Heart of Man to conceive, the Great∣ness of that Glory that is reserv'd for the People of God.—Beloved now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be; but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.</HI> The richest and strongest Images we can form, faint before the Glories of Paradise! Our Minds in their most exalted Flights, cannot project ade∣quate Ideas of it, and our Speech is lost in Obscurity when we attempt the Theme.</P>
<P>In the mean time we may be permitted to say, that it is an <HI>eternal Salvation,</HI> a Happiness that shall know no <HI>Interruption</HI> or <HI>End;</HI> and hence the Place where it is enjoy'd is call'd a <HI>City, that hath Founda∣tions, whose builder and maker is God.</HI> It is perfectly freed from all the Changes and Vicissitudes to which the Things of Time are Subject.</P>
<P><PB N="329" REF="005697_0328_1026C4DAA4280EC8"/><HI>Thirdly:</HI> Another Argument us'd by the Apostle in our Text, to excite to Obedi∣ence, is the <HI>Property</HI> that <HI>Believers</HI> have in <HI>Salvation;</HI> Work out <HI>your own</HI> Salvation. <HI>Property</HI> is certainly the <HI>Spring</HI> of <HI>Labour</HI> and <HI>Sollicitude</HI> about the Things of Time, and shou'd it not be much more so about the Things of Eternity, which infinitely excel them in Importance and Duration? <HI>If you are wise here, you are wise for your selves, but if foolish you alone must bear it.</HI> It is your own Salvation, Brethren, which you are entreated to secure. And will ye not be concern'd about it, and <HI>labour for that Meat which will never perish?</HI></P>
<P>Some that neglect others Business, are careful about their own, because of their <HI>Property.</HI> Well, here is an <HI>Eternal</HI> and most <HI>important Property,</HI> the <HI>one Thing needful,</HI> which exceeds in Value all the rest; and which unless it be secur'd, all is lost; <HI>For what shall a Man give in ex∣change for his Soul, if he shou'd gain the whole World and loose the same?</HI></P>
<P>And forasmuch as it is highly proba∣ble, that there are different <HI>Degrees</HI> of
<PB N="330" REF="005697_0329_1026C52344C125D8"/>
<HI>Glory,</HI> as well as of Misery, and that those who have made the greatest Advances in Holiness and Usefulness are made Partakers of the former. This is no inconsiderable Excitement to religious Diligence; <HI>He that gain'd ten Talents, was made Ruler over ten Cities; and those that turn many unto Righte∣ousness,</HI> are said to <HI>shine as the Stars for ever and ever,</HI> i. e. with distinguish'd Lustre. But the</P>
<P><HI>Fourth,</HI> and last Argument, which the Apostle useth in our Text, to excite the believing <HI>Philippians,</HI> and us thro' them, to work out the <HI>Work of your Salvation with fear and tremblings,</HI> is this, <HI>that it is God which worketh in us, both to will and to do of his own good Pleasure.</HI> This Ar∣gument is adapted to work upon our <HI>Gra∣titude,</HI> our <HI>Fear</HI> and our <HI>Hope,</HI> as appears thus:</P>
<P>It is a great Instance of divine <HI>Goodness</HI> and Condescension, that he freely and with∣out any desert of yours, works in you by his holy Spirit a Disposition and Capacity to do good; and therefore, <HI>Ingenuity</HI> and <HI>Gratitude</HI> for so great a <HI>Benefit,</HI> should con∣strain
<PB N="331" REF="005697_0330_1026C4DC2A270FB8"/>
you to comply with his blessed Ope∣rations.</P>
<P>It is a <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>sovereign God</HI> who, works in you of his own <HI>good Pleasure,</HI> who if ye do not comply with his Influences <HI>hum∣bly</HI> and <HI>speedily,</HI> will be provok'd to with∣draw them, and chastise your neglect; tho' he will not <HI>take his loving Kindness away, or suffer his Faithfulness to fail; yet he will chastise your Iniquities with Rods, and your Transgressions with Stripes.</HI> This Conside∣ration may justly alarm your Fear.</P>
<P>It is a <HI>gracious God</HI> who works in you, both <HI>to will and to do:</HI> And this may Sup∣port your <HI>Hope;</HI> tho' you are not equal to the Work requir'd, God is able and willing to help you, in case <HI>you stir up your selves to lay hold upon him,</HI> and labour to improve the Grace ye have receiv'd; and this he has given you a Proof of, in his working in you both to will and to do of his own good Pleasure.</P>

us, of the Folly and Danger, of the Principles and Practice of the <HI>Antinomians</HI> and <HI>Libertines,</HI> who slight the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>good Works done in Obedience to it,</HI> with a View to a Reward of Grace. They cry up <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> to the Disparage∣ment of <HI>good Works,</HI> as if we had nothing to do but <HI>fold our Arms with the Sluggard,</HI> and expect to be carried to Heaven on our <HI>Couches.</HI> But the <HI>Religion</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> is a <HI>Mistery</HI> of <HI>Godliness,</HI> and his Doctrines the <HI>Truth according to Godliness, pure Religion and und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied,</HI> is active and laborious, it disposes to <HI>visit the Widow and the Father∣less, and to keep our selves unspotted from the World;</HI> and <HI>to add to our Faith Vertue, and to Vertue Godliness, and to Godliness Bro∣therly-Kindness, and to Brotherly-Kindness Charity.</HI> But to shed Light upon the Sub∣ject, let me briefly answer the most mate∣rial <HI>Objections</HI> against what has been said. And</P>
<P N="1">1st. Some Object, <Q>That urging of <HI>good Works</HI> is <HI>prejudicial</HI> to Christ's <HI>Merit.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> If we urged good Works, to be
<PB N="333" REF="005697_0332_1026C4DF2EEA73C8"/>
perform'd with the same Intention that Christ did them as <HI>Mediator,</HI> namely to <HI>satisfy divine Justice,</HI> and <HI>purchase</HI> a <HI>Title</HI> to <HI>Happiness</HI> in any degree, it wou'd be derogatory to Christ's Merit, I confess, but when we urge them to be perform'd with a very different Design, namely, out of <HI>Gratitude</HI> to God, and with a View to obtain by them, (as appointed Means for that end) a greater Degree of <HI>Meetness</HI> for the actual <HI>Possession</HI> of that <HI>Happiness</HI> which we have a <HI>Right</HI> to, only thro' <HI>Faith</HI> in his <HI>Blood</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> it sweetly Harmonizes with his <HI>Merit.</HI></P>
<P>The dear Redeemer, has not only pur∣chas'd <HI>Glory</HI> for his Elect, but <HI>Grace</HI> to prepare them for it, which he enjoyns the unconverted to <HI>seek;</HI> and hence they are commanded <HI>to make them a new Heart.</HI> Even <HI>Simon Magus</HI> was advised to <HI>pray, if peradventure the Thoughts of his Heart might be forgiven him.</HI> And this Grace the converted are enjoyn'd to improve. Good Works are one End of the Redeem∣er's Purchase; <HI>who gave himself for us</HI> (says the Apostle to <HI>Titus) that he might
<PB N="334" REF="005697_0333_1026C52A8A4E7938"/>
redeem us from all Iniquity, and purify to himself a peculiar People zealous of good Works.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 2d. "Urging of <HI>Works</HI> is <HI>dero∣gatory</HI> to <HI>free Grace by which we are sav'd.</HI>"</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> No! For tho' God gives his <HI>Grace</HI> freely of his own sovereign Pleasure, when and to whom he pleases; yet such is his Wisdom, that he generally (in order to incite his reasonable Creatures to Diligence) gives <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>increase</HI> of it in the <HI>Way</HI> of <HI>Means;</HI> and therefore he has told us, <HI>that for all these Things he will be enquir'd of,</HI> and COMMANDS us to <HI>ask, that we may receive.</HI> Besides it should be consi∣der'd, that there is a Difference between a <HI>Right</HI> to <HI>Salvation,</HI> and the <HI>Possession</HI> of it: the first is altogether by <HI>Grace,</HI> but the latter is not to be expected without <HI>Works;</HI> (if there be any Opportunity to perform them) <HI>for without Holiness no Man shall see the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 3d. <Q>To urge Men to work out their Salvation is vain and impossi∣ble.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="005697_0334_1026C4E44FA5F758"/><HI>Ans.</HI> It is a Mistake: The unconverted may abstain from many Evils they commit, and seriously wait upon God in the Per∣formance of commanded Duty, which if they do, and labour to avoid depending thereupon, there is a <HI>Probability</HI> of their obtaining Mercy.</P>
<P>Besides the Calls that are given them, have a Tendency to convince them of their Impotency, and so to humble them and prepare them for divine Grace, (I mean in respect of <HI>Order.</HI>)</P>
<P>Add to this, that they are Means of di∣vine Appointment, which God is wont to bless for that end.</P>
<P>As to the converted they have a Prin∣ciple of Grace, and so may stir up them∣selves in some sort to lay hold on God; they may strive for the Exercise of Grace and the Improvement of what they have receiv'd; and it is in this way only, that they can with reason expect it; <HI>To him that hath shall be given.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Object.</HI> 4th. "To urge Works is <HI>Legal.</HI>'</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> If Works are urg'd with a Design to <HI>Merit</HI> by them, it is <HI>legal</HI> in a bad
<PB N="336" REF="005697_0335_1026C52C10D99170"/>
Sense, and so sinful and dangerous; <HI>For such as seek after Righteousness as it were by the Works of the Law, shall not obtain Righteousness,</HI> but to urge them as the Way to the Kingdom of Heaven, and as <HI>Expressions</HI> of <HI>Thankfulness</HI> to God, is no more than what Christ and his Apostles have done, and if any will presumptuously call them legal, they declare their own Shame. Now to do good Works with the Design before mentioned, is to be legal in a good Sense: <HI>i. e.</HI> conform'd to the Law; or in other Words, it is to be Holy; and therefore those <HI>Libertines</HI> that object against it, they make <HI>Holiness</HI> it self <HI>Matter</HI> of <HI>Reproach.</HI></P>
<P>The Term <HI>Legal</HI> is much abus'd by the <HI>Antinomians;</HI> hereby the Ignorant are amus'd and prejudic'd against <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Holiness,</HI> by empty Sounds that they do not understand. The <HI>English</HI> Word <HI>legal,</HI> comes from the <HI>Latin</HI> Word <HI>lex,</HI> a Law; so that etymologically, (or originally,) it signifies what belongs to the Law. Custom has put a bad Sense upon the Word since the Reformation from <HI>Popery,</HI> to denote a <HI>De∣pendance</HI>
<PB N="337" REF="005697_0336_1026C4E5D44FFB50"/>
upon <HI>Works</HI> or <HI>Obedience</HI> to the <HI>Law</HI> for Justification, or a being discou∣rag'd in the Way of Obedience, because of lamented Imperfections, while we be∣lieve and are sincerely laborious. Both these Things are doubtless very bad, and to be avoided. Now the Word is only properly used in a bad Sense when it is applied to them; but it is basely abus'd when applied by way of <HI>Invective</HI> against <HI>Care</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> in <HI>Obedience</HI> to the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> The original Meaning of the Word <HI>legal</HI> is good, it signifies a Regard or Conformity to the Law; or in other Words to be holy; and the bad Sense that has been put upon it in later Times is improper and figurative; so that to say a Man is bad because he is <HI>legal,</HI> or careful to conform to the Law, is to say in other Words, that he is wicked because he is holy, which is no very strong Argument to prove the Point.</P>

Branch of the COMMISSION Christ gives to his Ministers, and there∣fore is one Character by which we may be assisted in judging who they are. I may add to what has been said, that <HI>Repentance</HI> is excluded by the Covenant of Works, there is no Place for Repentance there, no Plank after Shipwreck; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nulla tabula post naufragium, Justificati amici, L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gis efficiuntur, <HI>says</HI> Ambrose i. e. <HI>Justified Persons are Friends of the Law.</HI></NOTE> it requires no∣thing but perfect Obedience, and neither enjoyns nor admits <HI>Repentance,</HI> for it ad∣mits not of Pardon; and where there is no Forgiveness, there can be no Place for Repentance; <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Forgiveness</HI> come in therefore by the <HI>New Covenant.</HI> From what has been said upon this Head, considered complexly, you may see, that if there be any Gospel-Duties at all, Re∣pentance is one, and therefore that those who reject it, as <HI>legal,</HI> understand not what they say, nor whereof they affirm, and have found out a PRETENDED GOS∣PEL different from what Christ and his Apostles preach'd.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="005697_0343_1026C5371E6EF078"/>Let me therefore exhort you, my Bre∣thren! to the Exercise of <HI>Repentance,</HI> and <HI>other good Works;</HI> Work out the <HI>Work of your Salvation with fear and trembling;</HI> and O bewail your past Defects. To this you are obliged many ways, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First:</HI> By the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> which consists of two Parts, namely, God's <HI>Pro∣mise</HI> to you, and yours to him. As he has <HI>promis'd to be your God,</HI> so ye have <HI>pro∣mis'd to be his People: i. e.</HI> to behave suit∣able to the Character of such. God's gra∣cious Promises to assist in the Perfor∣mance of Duty, does not weaken but strengthen our Obligations thereto.</P>
<P>The Promise of Grace proceeds from all the sacred Three, who equally concur to the Work of Redemption, and because of their different Manner of Operation, bear a peculiar Relation to us thereby. The first Person of the Trinity, as a <HI>Father,</HI> adopts us into his Family; the Second, as a <HI>Head</HI> and <HI>Redeemer,</HI> ransoms us and unites us as a Body mystical to himself; the third Person as a <HI>Sanctifier,</HI> consecrates us as his Temples; from all which a three∣fold
<PB N="345" REF="005697_0344_1026C4F15D93AF90"/>
Necessity of Obedience results, name∣ly, that we may live suitable to the <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Character</HI> of <HI>Sons</HI> of God, of <HI>Mem∣bers</HI> of Christ, and of <HI>Temples</HI> of the Holy Ghost, <HI>being zealous of good Works.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly:</HI> We are obliged to good Works by the <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> which the Gospel opens, which are not meerly <HI>Speculative</HI> and entertaining to the <HI>Mind,</HI> but <HI>Practical,</HI> which affect and renew the <HI>Will,</HI> regulate the <HI>Affections,</HI> and reform the <HI>Practice;</HI> they are <HI>Truths</HI> that <HI>sanctify</HI> the whole Man. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John xvii. 17.</NOTE> <HI>A Law of Spirit and Life, which frees us from the Law of Sin and Death.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Which make us not without Law, but under the Law to Christ.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ix. 21.</NOTE> The Doctrines of Grace are a <HI>Mystery of Piety,</HI> the <HI>Religion</HI> they explain and inculcate, <HI>is pure and undefiled.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly:</HI> We are obliged to <HI>good Works,</HI> by the <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> into which the <HI>Gospel</HI> brings us, which is a spi∣ritual Freedom from the <HI>Curse</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> the <HI>Tyranny</HI> of the <HI>Devil,</HI> and the <HI>Domi∣nion</HI>

of Sin, not a FLESHLY LICENCE, that frees us from <HI>Obedience</HI> to <HI>God's Law,</HI> but such a Liberty as engages us the more to love and serve the blessed God, both in Point of Duty and of Gratitude; <HI>being then made free from sin,</HI> says <HI>Paul</HI> to the believing <HI>Romans, ye became the Servants of Righteousness</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 18.</NOTE> And elsewhere he ad∣dresses the believing <HI>Gala<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ans</HI> thus; <HI>For Brethren ye have been call'd unto Liberty, only use not Liberty for an Occasion to the Flesh.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 13.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly:</HI> We are obliged to <HI>good Works</HI> by all the <HI>Benefits</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> whether re∣lative or real, whether in purpose or per∣formance, whether past, present or to come; <HI>For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Grace of God that bringeth Salva∣tion, hath appear'd to all Men,</HI> (to all Na∣tions of Men, to all Orders of Men) <HI>teach∣ing, us, that denying ungodliness and worldly Lusts, we should live soberly, righteously and godly in this present World.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> The Doc∣trines of Grace do not only teach this, but the Gifts of Grace oblige and dispose to it.</P>

<P>And good Works are likewise represent∣ed, as the <HI>Fruits, Signs</HI> and <HI>Seals</HI> of <HI>Grace</HI> present; but the <HI>Fruit of the Spirit is gen∣tleness, Meekness, Temperance.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> <HI>As the Branch cannot bear Fruit of it self, except it abide in the Vine.

<P>Yea, my Brethren, <HI>good Works</HI> are also represented as the <HI>Seed, First-fruits</HI> and <HI>Earnests</HI> of <HI>Glory</HI> future; <HI>He that soweth to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap Life everlasting; and not only they, but our selves also, which have the First-Fruits of the Spirit. We groan within ourselves, waiting for the Redemption of our Bodies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="005697_0347_1026C53BB9F3FFA0"/>The Holy Scripture represents <HI>good Works</HI> as having a Respect to Happiness in the coming World, somewhat like that of <HI>Labour</HI> to the <HI>Reward,</HI> of <HI>Means</HI> to the <HI>End,</HI> of a <HI>Way</HI> to the <HI>Mark,</HI> of a <HI>Combat</HI> to the <HI>Crown;</HI> from all which considerations it appears, that good Works are so necessary to Salvation, that it cannot be obtain'd with∣out them; and hence the Gospel pronoun∣ces <HI>Condemnation</HI> upon all <HI>unholy</HI> and <HI>pro∣phane Persons,</HI> and declares that <HI>they shall not inherit the Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Dear Brethren, be excited for God's sake, and for your own Souls sake, to <HI>work out the Work of your Salvation, with fear and trembling.</HI> O consider, that this is the <HI>Design</HI> of the Father's <HI>electing Love,</HI> of the <HI>Death</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> of the <HI>Son</HI> of God; he dy'd to purchase Grace for it, and liv'd to give an Example of it. And is it not the great Design of the blessed <HI>Spirit's Office</HI> to promote this? To what but this tends every <HI>Line</HI> of the <HI>Book</HI> of God, and all Discourses drawn from it?</P>
<P>To promote this all <HI>Duties</HI> and <HI>Ordi∣nances</HI> of Worship were enjoyn'd, and <HI>Pro∣vidence</HI>
<PB N="349" REF="005697_0348_1026C553A3A25850"/>
in its various Aspects, either <HI>benign</HI> or <HI>adverse,</HI> bends as a well-drawn Line to this Center.</P>
<P>O therefore, let <HI>Love</HI> to God the <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> and to our <HI>own Souls</HI> con∣strain us to <HI>Obedience:</HI> And O let a Regard to the Glory of God and the Good of Mankind engage us thereto.</P>
<P>Sirs! All Incentives of Action conspire in this. O let <HI>Honour, Interest, Duty,</HI> and <HI>Gratitude</HI> allure, excite, and constrain you to work out the Work of your Salva∣tion with fear and trembling.</P>
<P>But why should we <HI>Work</HI> with <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>trembling?</HI> I answer, because God requires and deserves it, and likewise it is suitable to our dependent State, and many ways promotes our Interest and Benefit.</P>
<P>The commanding Will of God is ex∣press in this Matter, as our Text signifies; and this alone should be sufficient to de∣termine the Compliance of all intelligent Creatures. But because we are naturally backward to our Duty, therefore other Arguments may be suggested.</P>
<P>The blessed God has not only a right to
<PB N="350" REF="005697_0349_1026C5422C7E9448"/>
our Fear and Reverence, because he has made us by his Power, preserv'd us and provided for us, by his watchful and kind Providence; but he also deserves it on ac∣count of his glorious Perfections, every of which are proper Objects of <HI>Fear,</HI> as well as powerful <HI>Incentives</HI> to it, when beheld in a just light. Particularly his unble∣mished <HI>Purity,</HI> his almighty <HI>Power,</HI> his infinite <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and inflexible <HI>Justice,</HI> his awful <HI>Majesty</HI> and alluring <HI>Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>How affecting is the <HI>Purity</HI> of God, my Brethren! Surely Jehovah is <HI>glorious in Holiness.</HI> This venerable Attribute of the Deity, demerits a Tribute of Reverence from all the intelligent Creation. While the noblest Seraphims behold it, they are o∣vercome (as it were) by its superior Blaze and Beauty, into Transport and Extacy, and cry out <HI>holy, holy, holy, is the Lord of Hosts, the whole Earth is full of his Glory: they cover their Faces and their Feet with their Wings,</HI> as unworthy to behold it and to be beheld by it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah. vi.</NOTE> The <HI>Angels</HI> them∣selves

being Creatures, cannot bear the daz∣ling Lustre of the divine Purity, but are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onscious of their infinite Distance from the divine Perfection, and therefore are full of <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Reverence</HI> in their Atten∣dance upon God. How much more then should we who are impure Creatures of a meaner Mould? O! if we had clearer Discoveries of God's Purity, we should fear him more. When the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> had a Glimpse of the Glory of Christ, be∣ing overcome with its Lustre, he fell down at Jesus Knees, and said, <HI>depart from me, for I am a sinful Man O Lord.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke v. 8.</NOTE> We can∣not behold the natural <HI>Sun</HI> in his meridian Altitude, with our naked Eye long, be∣cause its superior Brightness overcomes the weak Organs of our Sight.</P>
<P>And does not the Almighty <HI>Power</HI> of <HI>God</HI> deserve our Fear? A <HI>Power</HI> which has no <HI>Bounds</HI> but his own Nature and Will; a <HI>Power,</HI> by which with a Word and in a Moment, he spoke the stupenduous <HI>Fa∣brick</HI> of Heaven and Earth into Being, and
<PB N="352" REF="005697_0351_1026C545709A5E18"/>
by which he supports them in their present Order: A <HI>Power</HI> by which he bounds the turbulent Deep with a Girdle of Sand, that it shall not again inundate the World: A <HI>Power,</HI> by which he binds the <HI>Winds in his Fists,</HI> and brings the <HI>Snow and Hail out of his Treasures,</HI> as well as the <HI>former and the latter rain:</HI> A <HI>Power,</HI> by which he thunders in the Heavens, and breaks the Councils of his Enemies on Earth, and does what he pleaseth in defiance of all Opposition of Men and Devils, in the Kingdoms of Nature, of Grace, and Pro∣vidence: <HI>Who would not fear thee, thou King of Nations?</HI> who hast a sovereign absolute Empire over all. <HI>Fear him,</HI> saith our Lord, <HI>who is able to cast Soul and Body into Hell.</HI> As Jehovah is the most valuable <HI>Friend,</HI> so he is the most formidable <HI>Foe; For who knows the Power of his Anger, even according to his Fear, so is his Wrath;</HI> we cannot equal it, far less exceed it, in our most trembling, fearful Flights of Thought, because it is infinite, and all our Ideas are finite.</P>
<P>And surely, my Brethren, the <HI>infinite
<PB N="353" REF="005697_0352_1026C55A5D5F9F70"/>
Knowledge of God,</HI> by which all things from everlasting to everlasting, are open at once to his Eye, is enough to strike your Souls with a solemn Awe of God. This Consideration much affected the Psalmist, (and well it might) <HI>Thou knowest</HI> (says he) <HI>my down-sitting and my up-rising, thou un∣derstandest my Thought afar off, thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> passest my path, and my lying-down, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acquainted with all my Ways.—Such Know∣ledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. The Darkness is as the Light to God, and the Night shines as the Day.</HI> O Sirs! the Thoughts of God's <HI>all-seeing Eye</HI> being continually upon us, beholding us in our most secure Retreats, is enough to make us fear and tremble be∣fore him.</P>
<P>Add to this the inflexible <HI>Justice</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> which disposes him to render to all accord∣ing to their Works; this is impartial in its Executions, it will not spare because of the Number or Quality of Transgressors, but render to them exactly according to the Degrees of their Guilt, and when the Time of Probation expires, it is inexora∣ble;
<PB N="354" REF="005697_0353_1026C546F4E45438"/>
this excites Jehovah's <HI>Power,</HI> and awakes his <HI>Wrath</HI> to Arms; this makes his <HI>Vengeance</HI> burn and sparkle against in∣dolent and obstinate Transgressors; this opens impending Clouds of <HI>Indignation,</HI> and makes them break into resistless Tor∣rents of Woe, which drown Sinners in a suddain Death, and sweep them off the burden'd Globe, into a swift, certain, and eternal Destruction!</P>
<P>And how affecting likewise, dear Bre∣thren, is the <HI>Majesty</HI> and <HI>Immensity</HI> of the blessed GOD! which fills Heaven and Earth, and infinitely surpasses the Bounds of Matter! Tho' the Globe we tread upon be very extensive, yet it is but a Point compar'd with the visible Heavens, and that, it is probable, is much exceeded by the third Heaven; and yet we are inform'd, that <HI>the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain God.</HI> The Sinner therefore cannot escape his Cognizance or Justice; this Thought affected the Psalmist, who speaks in the following Manner respecting it; <HI>Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? Or whither shall I flee from thy Presence? If I ascend up
<PB N="355" REF="005697_0354_1026C55BE3971198"/>
into Heaven, thou art there: If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there. If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermost Parts of the Sea; even there shall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand shall hold me.</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxxxix. 8, 9.</NOTE> If we ascend <HI>Carmel</HI>'s Top, or dive the Ocean's Depths, God is there. <HI>He is wise in Heart and mighty in Strength, who has hardened himself against God and prospered?</HI></P>
<P>And does not the <HI>Goodness</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> lay us under strong and ingenuous Engage∣ments to fear him? O is it not the vilest <HI>Ingratitude</HI> to offend such a faithful Friend, such an indulgent Father, such a bounteous Benefactor, and requite him evil for good? Will not therefore our fear of displeasing him, rise in Proportion to the Degree of our Love to him, and that in Proportion to the Degree of our Faith in his Promises, and View of his Excellencies?</P>
<P>Now Sirs, if we compare our <HI>Vileness</HI> with God's <HI>Purity,</HI> our <HI>Weakness</HI> with his <HI>Almightiness,</HI> our <HI>Ignorance</HI> with his <HI>Know∣ledge,</HI>
<PB N="356" REF="005697_0355_1026C549C1B6E378"/>
our <HI>Guilt</HI> with his <HI>Justice,</HI> our <HI>Cru∣elty</HI> with his <HI>Goodness,</HI> may not this View make us fear and tremble before him? Moreover, is it not congruous to the State of a dependent Creature, to fear and trem∣ble before his great Lord and Sovereign, to whom he owes, and on whom depends his All?</P>
<P>Yea, my Brethren, as the <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>God</HI> is the distinguishing <HI>Character</HI> of his People, and the <HI>Foundation</HI> of all <HI>Religion,</HI> so the constant Sense of it, is of peculiar Service to promote its Interest in the Souls of Men: by this they are more conform'd to God in Holiness, and dispos'd to perform Acts of Worship to him, with a Decency and Reverence becoming a Creature to his Lord and Sovereign; and by this many hurtful Excesses are prevented; without this, we are like a Vessel that has large Sails but no Ballast, and is in the mean time beat upon with boisterous Winds and angry Waves; without this, our <HI>Faith</HI> degenerates into <HI>Presumption,</HI> our <HI>Love</HI> into an <HI>effeminate Fondness,</HI> our <HI>Hope</HI> into <HI>Impudence,</HI> our <HI>Joy</HI> into <HI>Froth</HI> and <HI>Lightness,</HI> our suppos'd

<HI>Communion</HI> with God, into an <HI>undecent Ir∣reverence,</HI> as if we were upon a par with him, who are but Worms of the Dust, that are crush'd before the Moth, and lighter than Vanity.</P>
<P>And indeed without the Fear of God, we are apt to be catch'd unawares, and fall heed∣less and headlong into every sinful Snare that we are expos'd to. <HI>Abraham</HI> the Friend of God, excell'd in this ornamental Grace. After his extraordinary Vision, he speaks in the following Strain; <HI>How dread∣ful is this Place?
