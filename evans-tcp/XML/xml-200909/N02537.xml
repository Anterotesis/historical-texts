<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOB X. 22.</HI></BIBL>
<P>— Without any Order.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Words</HI> are spoken by holy <HI>Job</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> and the <HI>Grave,</HI> which he tho't just before him, and where he wish'd to have been, by the Will of GOD. "<HI>I go</HI> (says he) <HI>whence I shall not return, even to the land of darkness and the shadow of death,</HI> WITHOUT ANY ORDER, <HI>and where the light is as darkness.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT a dark &amp; melancholly, not to say dismal Description is here of the visible state of the <HI>Dead?</HI> and how are the gloomy words doubled and trebled to represent the thick <HI>Darkness;</HI> a darkness to be felt and seen; not by the dead that neither see nor feel, but by the <HI>living who lay it to their heart.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="003009_0004_0FEFDD622B8D3738"/>
BUT it is not the <HI>darkness</HI> of the Grave that I am now to insist on, only as one part of the darkness lies in the words of my <HI>Text, Without any Order.</HI> Indeed <HI>Order</HI> is not to be expected in <HI>darkness.</HI> Dark∣ness implies disorder, and the place of <HI>Order</HI> is where Light dwelleth. Were the light of the <HI>Sun</HI> put out, what disorder would presently follow upon Earth? Such a <HI>Connexion</HI> is there between Order and Light in the nature of things, and between Darkness &amp; Dis∣order.</P>
<P>BUT to drop the connexion of the words;</P>
<P><HI>JOB</HI> seems to speak here, 1. of the <HI>time</HI> &amp; <HI>man∣ner</HI> of Deaths coming on one and another, that we can observe no <HI>Order</HI> in the thing: 2. of the <HI>visible State</HI> of the dead, the <HI>Grave,</HI> where we find no Order at all; natural, civil or religious. It is <HI>a land of dark∣ness without any order.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. <HI>DEATH seems not to us to observe and keep any Rule &amp; Order in it's taking away one and another; and the visible State of the dead is without any Order.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. I. <HI>DEATH seems not to us to observe and keep any Rule &amp; Order, in its taking away one and another.</HI> I say not, that it does not <HI>observe</HI> the best and most exact Order, but that this Order does not <HI>appear</HI> to us.</P>
<P>IT certainly has its Order from GOD as to every one it takes away, when and in what manner they shall die. It certainly proceeds in a wise and good Or∣der by his Will and Direction. Yet we are not sensible of any fixed Rule that it goes by. — To be sure every one dies in his <HI>own Order;</HI> in his appointed time and hour, which is order'd exactly and performed by GOD as it shou'd be: whether in Judgment, or in Mercy.</P>
<P>DEATH has it's Order from the LORD OF LIFE, the just <HI>Rewarder</HI> and the righteous <HI>Judge.</HI> There is <HI>an appointed time to Man upon Earth, the number of his months</HI> and days <HI>are with GOD; his bounds
<PB N="3" REF="003009_0005_0FEFDD6ECC475F20"/>are determined</HI> to an hour and a minute, which <HI>he cannot pass.</HI> Not <HI>a Sparrow,</HI> and much less any Child of <HI>Man, falls to the ground without the will of our</HI> FATHER <HI>in Heaven</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Job vii. 1. Matth. x. 29.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AND be sure the Maker and GOD of our Spirits does all things well, in perfect Wisdom and Order. Death is kept in GOD'S own hand, or (which is the same thing) it is put into the hand of CHRIST, <HI>the Only-begotten of the</HI> FATHER: It is in the best Hand: Never the less we cannot observe the Order that it keeps; either,

<ITEM>1. As to the <HI>Time,</HI> or</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. As to the <HI>Manner</HI> of ones dying and anothers.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. As to the <HI>Time</HI> of Death's coming to one and another, it seems <HI>without any Order.</HI> We cannot ob∣serve any <HI>natural</HI> Order, nor <HI>moral,</HI> nor <HI>political</HI> in the approach of Death, here or there.</P>
<P N="1">1. No <HI>natural</HI> Order. By which I mean, according to the course of <HI>Nature;</HI> as to us it would seem order∣ly for the <HI>Elder</HI> to go before the Younger, and <HI>Pa∣rents</HI> before their Children. But Death observes no such Order of Nature and Age. Younger Persons do often die <HI>before</HI> their Elders, and Children before their Parents. At the next door again, the Elder dies before the Younger; the Parents before the Children.</P>
<P><HI>SIN</HI> that bro't in Death broke in upon this seem∣ing natural Order, and the natural Desires both of Pa∣rents and Children. For <HI>Parents</HI> naturally and strongly desire, if it may please GOD, that their Children may out-live them; and <HI>Children</HI> naturally hope and expect to out-live their Parents, by the Will of GOD. But the <HI>first Death</HI> we read of broke this Order, namely <HI>Abel's;</HI> and how many more of their Children <HI>Adam</HI> &amp; <HI>Eve</HI> liv'd to bury we know not. But this we know that the <HI>best</HI> among their fallen Offspring share in this Grief after them.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003009_0006_0FEFDD71CE91F330"/>
SOMETIMES the youngest Children of the Family die first, the <HI>Youth</HI> dies before the Adult, the <HI>Adult</HI> before the <HI>Aged,</HI> and the <HI>Hoary Head</HI> follows many an <HI>Infant</HI> to the Grave. But neither is <HI>this</HI> Order kept to by Death, for sometimes an <HI>Isaac</HI> and a <HI>Jacob</HI> die in a good old Age, with their Sons about them.</P>
<P N="2">2. DEATH seems not to regard or keep any <HI>Moral Order</HI> in its approch to one and another. The <HI>Good</HI> die before the bad, and the <HI>bad</HI> again before the Good; here the Righteous before the Wicked, and there the wicked before the Godly. Here <HI>the wicked is driven away in his wickedness,</HI> and there he <HI>lives old and is mighty in power.</HI> Here the Godly die <HI>young</HI> desired and lamented, and in the midst of their usefulness; and there their <HI>hoary head is a Crown of glory in the ways of Righteousness.</HI> The least worthy and fit to live, as we are ready to think, do often out-live their betters; and those of whom the World is not worthy, a <HI>Josiah,</HI> the <HI>Baptist,</HI> a <HI>Stephen,</HI> are taken away young; lament∣ed and bewailed. <HI>Good Men</HI> are ready to call this <HI>without any Order,</HI> while they <HI>mourn</HI> the early Deaths of the wise and prudent, the pious and godly, the use∣ful and profitable; and while they <HI>groan</HI> under the useless and hurtful prolonged Life of the wicked.</P>
<P N="3">3. DEATH seems not to regard any <HI>Political or Civil Order</HI> among Men, in its approaches to one &amp; another. It regards no Distinction, Rank, or Degree of Men, in State or Church. The Noble and Ignoble, the Lord or the Slave, the Master and the Servant, are treated just alike by Death. There is no <HI>Precedency</HI> kept to. The <HI>Prince</HI> does not go <HI>first</HI> here, and his <HI>Nobles</HI> next; nor do they affect or desire it.</P>
<P>If the first in <HI>Quality</HI> and <HI>Rank</HI> were first to die, 'twould spoil all the <HI>Order</HI> and State and Glory of the World that now is; and turn it upside down. <HI>Crowns</HI> would grow cheap, and Men would shun the Honours they now court and pride in. The Order that <HI>Courts</HI> and <HI>Parliaments</HI> wou'd be ready to make,
<PB N="5" REF="003009_0007_0FEFDD7382059400"/>if they had power to Enact about the Time of Death, would be for the <HI>poor</HI> &amp; <HI>low</HI> to go to the Grave <HI>before</HI> their Superiours. But <HI>Riches profit not,</HI> nor Dignity and Power, in the day of Death. None of 'em can by any means deliver Himself, nor redeem his Brother. <HI>Princes die young,</HI> in the midst of all their Bloom and Hopes, or of their Fame and Glory; and <HI>Peasants live old</HI> in their low and homely Cottages. This is <HI>with∣out any Order,</HI> in the account and eye of this World.</P>
<P>BUT this for the <HI>Time</HI> of Death's coming to one and another, <HI>without any Order.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. As to the <HI>Manner</HI> and <HI>Circumstances</HI> of one and anothers dying, Death keeps to no Order. The rich and the poor, the high and the low, the Parent and the Child, the young &amp; the old, the Friend &amp; the Enemy, they die alike; or quite differing one from the other: some a natural Death, some a violent, or by evil Accidents. The <HI>moral</HI> Characters of Persons are no security here, <HI>All things come alike to all, there is one Event to the righteous &amp; to the wicked, to the clean &amp; to the unclean; as is the good so is the sinner,</HI> Eccl. 9.2. The Sons of <HI>Job,</HI> and those of <HI>Aaron</HI> were struck dead, as well as <HI>Onan</HI> and <HI>Ananias</HI> in their Sin. The same Fevers or Dropsies, the same Consumptions, or the same Stu∣pors and Lethargies, seise and carry off one and another. The same Pains &amp; Torments rend and tear Persons of the most different Characters; whether on worldly Accounts, or on moral and religious. And the same noisome Diseases corrupt the Bodies, and destroy the Lives of Saints and Sinners; of <HI>Lazarus</HI> and of <HI>Herod.</HI> The hard and the easie Death, is common to good and bad, young and old, rich or poor, Parent and Offspring. <HI>Queens</HI> in their Palaces and fine linnen, and <HI>Beggars</HI> on the dunghil and in their rags, die of the same Sores and Ulcers. <HI>Kings</HI> die by evil Accidents, and by the hand of Violence, as well as others; and one as well as another prolong their dayes and <HI>die in their nest.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="003009_0008_0FEFDD75D82AEF78"/>
ONLY let us except here the <HI>last and utmost Disorder</HI> in Death, the <HI>dying as a fool dieth,</HI> wickedly and wilfully by his <HI>own hands,</HI> or impiously in <HI>brutal DUELS;</HI> which is but another way of SELF-MUR∣DER. These unnatural and detested <HI>wayes</HI> of dying are not to be named or supposed, when we speak of the <HI>Manner and Circumstances</HI> of one and anothers Death. Let <HI>these</HI> be proper for the <HI>impious</HI> and un∣godly, and to them alone if you will, and <HI>out</HI> of the present Argument, as they ought not to be once named in the World; how common soever they have been in it.</P>
<P>BUT this for the <HI>first Proposition: Death</HI> seems not to observe and keep any Rule or <HI>Order</HI> in its taking away one and another, whether we consider the <HI>Time</HI> or <HI>Manner</HI> of its coming.</P>
<P>PROP. II. <HI>THE visible State of the dead,</HI> that is, <HI>the Grave, is without any Order.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>this</HI> seems to be the meaning of the <HI>Text, A land of darkness as darkness it self, without any Order.</HI> But here we speak only of the <HI>visible</HI> State of the dead, not of the <HI>invisible.</HI></P>
<P>FOR if we look by Faith into the <HI>invisible</HI> World and State, there we behold the most perfect and <HI>glo∣rious Order.</HI> The good and the bad, the godly and the wicked are in their proper place; <HI>Judas</HI> in his, and the repenting <HI>Thief</HI> (thro' Grace) in his; namely the <HI>Paradise</HI> of CHRIST prepared for <HI>Penitents</HI> from the foundation of the World. The Servants of <HI>Sin</HI> and of <HI>Satan</HI> deceased, are gone accursed <HI>into everlasting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels,</HI> but the <HI>Dead in</HI> CHRIST are in the <HI>Mansions</HI> in the FATHER'S <HI>House.</HI> This is most <HI>exact Order,</HI> without respect of Persons, every Man according to his Works; the degrees of Reward and Punishment bearing a just Proportion to the degree, of Grace and labours of Love, and to the measures and degrees of Sin and Wickedness done in the Body. This is the bright and shining Order in the unseen and eternal State: Matth. 25. ult. <HI>These shall go away into everlasting Punishment, but the Righteous
<PB N="7" REF="003009_0009_0FEFDD7787B0BC18"/>into Life eternal.</HI> Dan. 12.2, 3. <HI>And many of them that sleep in the dust of the Earth shall awake, some to everlasting Life, and some to Shame &amp; everlasting Con∣tempt: And they that be Wise shall shine as the bright∣ness of the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever &amp; ever.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if we look, with these mortal Eyes, into the <HI>visible</HI> State of the dead, both the godly &amp; ungodly, it it is altogether <HI>without any Order.</HI> All go to one place, and all ly mixt and <HI>confused</HI> there. All turn to <HI>dust</HI> again, and ones dust has no Preheminence to sight and sense above anothers, no Distinction from the others: Alike do they <HI>sleep</HI> in the dust, and are covered in dark∣ness.</P>
<P>INDEED a Grave-stone may here and there inform you whose Body was laid in this place, and whose in that; that this was once <HI>Noble</HI> or <HI>Royal,</HI> and that <HI>vul∣gar</HI> and <HI>common,</HI> but take away the <HI>Monument</HI> and no appearance remains of Family and Blood, nor of Order civil or sacred among the dead. There <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Counsellors</HI> of the Earthly in their desolate Places, and there lies the hidden and <HI>untimely Birth,</HI> that never faw the light: There lies the <HI>Tyrant</HI> and Oppressor, and there his <HI>Prisoners</HI> are at rest together by him: <HI>The small and the great are there, and the servant is free from his master,</HI> Job 3.18, 19. There ly the Ashes of the <HI>wise,</HI> the learned, the virtuous and reli∣gious, and there the <HI>fool and brutish Person,</HI> that had neither Head nor Heart for any thing great and good, <HI>Like Sheep they are laid in the Grave, Death feeds on them,</HI> and the <HI>Worm</HI> is the only <HI>Relative</HI> that remains to them.</P>
<P>YET again, The Order of the <HI>Universe</HI> ceases in the Grave. There is neither Light nor Darkness, Heat or Cold, Day or Night, Summer or Winter known there. There is no <HI>Knowledge, Work or Device the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> no Good or Evil, Joy or Sorrow done or felt there: Nei∣ther is there Friendship or Enmity, Love or Hatred there. Eccl. 9.5, 6. <HI>The dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a Reward, also their Love and their Hatred and their Envy is perished; neither
<PB N="8" REF="003009_0010_0FEFDD793773A208"/>have they any more a Portion for ever in any thing that is done under the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>Finally, THERE is no <HI>religious Order</HI> in the Grave; no not in the Tomb of <HI>Abraham,</HI> and among the bodies of the <HI>Just.</HI> There is no <HI>Worship,</HI> no Praise or Prayer, in that place of silence no <HI>Sabbath</HI> there, tho' a con∣tinual <HI>Rest</HI> &amp; quiet. This was the Darkness &amp; <HI>Dis∣order</HI> of the Grave to the pious <HI>King,</HI> Isa. 38. <HI>I said in the cutting off my days, I shall no more see the</HI> LORD <HI>even the</HI> LORD, <HI>in the land of the living; I shall be∣hold Man no more with the Inhabitants of the Earth:— For the Grave cannot praise thee, Death cannot cele∣brate thee, they that go down to the Pit cannot hope for thy Truth: The Living, the living he shall praise thee, as I do this day; the Father to the Children shall make known thy Truth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WORSHIP</HI> is the holy <HI>Order</HI> &amp; Beauty both of this World and of that to come: This therefore is the Darkness of the Grave, that there is nothing of this holy Order in it, the <HI>Beauty of Holiness:</HI> Psalm 30.9. <HI>When I go down to the Pit, shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy Truth?</HI> Psal. 115. ust. <HI>The dead praise not the</HI> LORD, <HI>neither any that go down into silence; but we will bless the</HI> LORD <HI>from this time forth and for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>WE have look'd thus into the <HI>visible</HI> State of the dead, and we find it <HI>without any Order;</HI> without Sun or Stars, Sense or Motion, Relation or Condition, Wor∣ship or Sabbath.</P>
<P>I come now to make some USE and IMPROVEMENT of this <HI>Meditation.</HI> And if this be one point in the Darkness of <HI>Death,</HI> that it is <HI>without any Order?</HI></P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then, We see something very <HI>valuable</HI> in the Land of the living, and that is <HI>Order;</HI> and we learn, on the contrary, that next to <HI>Death</HI> is <HI>Disorder</HI> and Confusion.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003009_0011_0FEFDD63D9C62118"/>
THE Beauty of the <HI>Universe,</HI> of the natural and moral World, the Usefulness of things in it and the Fe∣licity of the Creatures, depend upon the excellent <HI>Order</HI> that GOD has constituted. <HI>The LORD is a GOD of Order.</HI> His Works declare it, his Word and Law prescribe and require it. Decency and Order go together, and so do Order &amp; Right. Every thing is beautiful and right in its time and order.</P>
<P>WHAT was the Work of <HI>Creation?</HI> but GOD'S bring∣ing the Heavens &amp; Earth into that beauteous &amp; use∣ful <HI>Order</HI> which we behold, out of a <HI>Chaos</HI> and State of Confusion? Gen. 1.2. <HI>And the Earth was with∣out form and void, and Darkness was upon the face of it: And the SPIRIT of GOD moved upon the face of the Waters: And GOD said, Let there be Light, and there was Light: — And GOD divi∣ded the Light from the Darkness, and GOD called the light Day, and the darkness He called Night: And GOD said, Let there be a Firmament,</HI> &amp; <HI>Lights</HI> therein, <HI>and let</HI> them <HI>be for signs, and for seasons, and for Dayes and for Years.</HI> Thus ORDER was the glo∣rious Work of GOD in the beginning, and by it <HI>all things consist:</HI> the Sun &amp; Moon &amp; Stars, in their various Dist∣ances, Magnitude, Motions, Influences and Benefits, are bright and shining Instances of glorious Order. <HI>Their Line is gone thro' all the Earth, and their Words to the End of the World.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG <HI>Men</HI> on Earth, GOD has appointed <HI>Rule and Order,</HI> and made them necessary to our comfort and safety, in private &amp; in public Society. Family Order is the foundation of our Peace and Welfare, of good Nei'bourhood, of Justice and Righteousness, of Bro∣therly-kindness and Charity; of civil Government and of joint publick Worship.</P>
<P>THE whole <HI>Law</HI> of GOD to us is comprehended in this one word <HI>Order;</HI> prescribing first our orderly Sub∣jection and Behaviour towards GOD, and then to one another in our several places and Relations; as Supe∣riors, Inseriors and Equals.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003009_0012_0FEFDD7C8A1596B8"/>
IT is ORDER that requires <HI>Children</HI> to honour their Father and Mother, which is <HI>the first Command∣ment with Promise. Order</HI> teaches them to <HI>rise up before the hoary Head, and to honour the Face of the Old Man. Order</HI> teaches <HI>Servants</HI> to obey their Masters according to the flesh, and <HI>Masters</HI> to give unto their Servants that which is just and equal. <HI>Order</HI> teaches Men to <HI>do Justice, to love Mercy, and to live Soberly, &amp; Righteously; and whatsoever we would that Men should do unto us, to do the same unto them. Or∣der</HI> teaches <HI>every Soul to be subject to the higher Pow∣ers, to obey Magistrates, and to be ready unto every good Work.</HI> And <HI>Order</HI> teaches <HI>Rulers</HI> to be <HI>just Men, ruling in the Fear of the</HI> LORD. <HI>Order</HI> teaches all <HI>Christians</HI> to <HI>know them that have the Rule over them</HI> in Things sacred, <HI>and to submit themselves</HI> as unto them <HI>that watch for their Souls:</HI> The <HI>younger like∣wise that they submit themselves unto the Elder; yea all of us to be subject one to another, and to be clothed with Humility. For</HI> GOD <HI>is not the Author of Confusion, but of Peace, in all the Churches of the Saints</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 2. Lev. xix 32. Col. iii. 22. Titus ii. 9 Micah vi. 8. Mat. vii. 12. 1 Cor. xiii. 1. Titus iii. 1 2 Sam. xxiii. 3. Heb. xiii. 7, 17. 1 Pet. v. 5. 1 Cor. xiv. 33</NOTE>. Thus <HI>Order</HI> is of GOD, and is the fulfilling of his <HI>Law,</HI> the Rule of a religious and godly Life.</P>
<P>BUT next to <HI>Death,</HI> or worse than Death is <HI>Disor∣der</HI> and Confusion. All the Misery of Man, both in this Life and in that which is to come, comes of it. If subverts Families, Schools, civil Government, and all Religion. This was the State of the <HI>old World</HI> be∣fore the Flood, and it was high time for the end of all Flesh to come. <HI>Order</HI> required their Destruction, and the bringing on a <HI>new</HI> World. This was <HI>Sodom</HI>'s wretched State; they were past all Order, Decency and Right; and it was time they were burnt up. And <HI>Jerusalem</HI> was come to the like <HI>Crisis,</HI> as <HI>Josephus</HI> reports, before their last Ruin. The Seditions and
<PB N="11" REF="003009_0013_0FEFDD805F5A0040"/>Strifes within were worse upon them, than the Arms of the <HI>Romans</HI> from without. I may add, That even <HI>Hell</HI> it self is forc'd to submit to some Order; <HI>For if Satan cast out Satan, and be divided against himself, how should his Kingdom stand?</HI> So <HI>Pirates</HI> &amp; <HI>Rob∣bers,</HI> that band together by <HI>Sea</HI> or <HI>Land,</HI> declaring against all <HI>Order</HI> and Law of GOD or Man, yet are forc'd to make &amp; observe <HI>Orders</HI> of their own, for their Preservation and Strength.</P>
<P><HI>DISORDER</HI> is as much the <HI>Misery</HI> &amp; Ruin as it is the <HI>Deformity</HI> of Societies, private or publick, civil or religious. It is as a broken Bone, or a Limb out of joint, which renders the Body useless, as well as fills it with Pain and Dolour. Or suppose a Body without a Head, or without Eyes, Hands or Feet, or these inverted and out of place; such is <HI>Disorder</HI> in Society.</P>
<P>WE should be very thankful therefore for the <HI>Order</HI> that there is in the World, as being the wise and good Establishment of GOD for our present &amp; future Well-being: And we should be very careful to preserve it in our places, and to do what we can to promote it every where. Psal. 34.14. <HI>Depart from Evil and do Good, seek Peace and pursue it.</HI></P>
<P>LET us reverence and prize the good GOVERNMENT over us, and all the good <HI>Orders</HI> and <HI>Laws</HI> enacted for the Defence and Security of our common Peace, Rights &amp; Properties. Let us be very thankful to GOD for the heavenly Rules and Benefits of <HI>Church-Order,</HI> establish'd by GOD for our <HI>spiritual</HI> &amp; everlasting Good. See Eph. 4.I,—16. And let all the blessed Precepts respecting <HI>Family</HI> and <HI>School</HI> Order, and a <HI>good Con∣versation in</HI> CHRIST, be regarded by us with like re∣ligious Esteem. <HI>Let us study to be quiet, and to do our own Business. Let us render to all their Dues; Honour to whom honour is due, Fear to whom fear, Tribute to whom tribute. And owe no Man any thing, but to love one another</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">I Thes. iv. 11. Rom. xiii. 7, 8.</NOTE>.</P>

I might go on and observe to you <HI>the dreadful Punishment of Sin,</HI> in all the <HI>Disorders</HI> &amp; <HI>Confusions</HI> which it has bro't upon Mankind in this wretched and <HI>mortal</HI> State; on Persons, on Families, on Provinces and Kingdoms; as by <HI>Deaths</HI> common and uncommon, so by the great <HI>Transgressions</HI> that do often bring on strange and tragical Ends.</P>
<P>I had tho't also to call on sober and thinking Persons, as well as on the vain and inconsiderate and irre∣ligious, to expect, fear and prepare for unknown and innumerable Disorders and <HI>Disasters</HI> in such a World as this is; and sometimes for things <HI>worse than Death,</HI> which come upon one Family and other <HI>without any Order</HI> observable to Man; and how often in the most surprizing and amazing manner.</P>
<P>O that old and young, high and low, rich and poor together, would consider seriously of the <HI>Truth</HI> before us and prepare to <HI>die,</HI> (<HI>without any Order,</HI> shall I say?) not knowing the <HI>Time</HI> or <HI>Manner</HI> of their End! We may well be <HI>dumb with silence</HI> this day, <HI>and hold our peace, even from good, and our sorrow be stirred.</HI> Well may <HI>our Heart wax hot</HI> within us, and <HI>while we are musing the Fire burn;</HI> and we <HI>speak with our Tongue, "Lord, make me to know my End, and the measure of my days, what it is; that I may know how frail I am!</HI></P>
<P>AND O that <HI>mortal Men</HI> would not value them∣selves, and much less vainly build on any <HI>worldly Or∣der,</HI> which <HI>Death</HI> forbids them to do, and <HI>Satan</HI> beguiles them into! For what <HI>outward</HI> Circumstance is there in this World, or indeed what state of <HI>Grace</HI> it self, that can give any Security against the sudden-Arrests of <HI>Death?</HI> or against Sorrows &amp; Calamities <HI>more bitter</HI> than that? Let the <HI>Godly</HI> look on them∣selves as liable every Day, to every kind and manner of <HI>Bereavement;</HI> or for <HI>living Sorrows</HI> more killing and lasting than those which meer <HI>Death</HI> has in his power to inflict.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003009_0015_0FF028419C5236B0"/>
BUT at the same time let the Godly remember for their <HI>Comfort,</HI> that the <HI>Resurrection-Day</HI> will bring all things into <HI>Order</HI> again. That <HI>Day of the Resti∣tution of all things,</HI> will put an <HI>End</HI> to all the <HI>Disor∣ders</HI> that Sin and Death have bro't into the World.— Indeed the Confusion of the <HI>wicked</HI> will be great in that glorious Day, their Fear &amp; Shame &amp; Anguish of heart; and they would rather still have been in all the <HI>disorder</HI> of the Grave: But this will not at all hinder the shining <HI>Order</HI> of the illustrious Day. <HI>For the</HI> SON OF MAN <HI>will come in his Glory, with all his holy Angels; then shall He sit upon the Throne of his Glory! And before Him shall be gather'd all Nations; and He will separate them as a Shepherd divideth his Sheep from the Goats; and then shall the</HI> KING <HI>say unto them on his right Hand, Come ye blessed of my</HI> FATHER, <HI>inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the World.</HI></P>
<P>O in what solemn glorious <HI>Order</HI> will the Godly and ungodly then appear before the <HI>Judgment-Seat of</HI> CHRIST, and about his Throne! See the <HI>Glory</HI> and read the <HI>Order:</HI> St. <HI>Jude</HI> v. 14, 15. <HI>Behold the</HI> LORD <HI>cometh with ten thousand of his Saints, to exe∣cute Judgment upon all, and to convince all that are ungodly of their Deeds and hard Speeches.</HI> Dan. 7. 9, 10. <HI>I beheld till the Thrones were cast down, and the</HI> ANCIENT OF DAYS <HI>did sit, whose Garment was white as Snow,</HI> and the Hair <HI>of his Head like the pure Wool: His Throne was like the fiery Flame, and his Wheels as burning Fire: A fiery stream issued and came forth before Him: Thousand thousands ministred unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before Him: the Judgment was set and the Books were opened.</HI> Once more read the ORDER and the GLORY: Rev. 20.11, — 15. <HI>I saw a great white Throne, and Him that sat on it, from whose Face the Earth and the Heaven fled away: And I saw the Dead small and great stand before</HI> GOD, <HI>and the Books were opened, and the Dead were judged, accor∣ding to their Works: And Death and Hell were cast into the Lake of Fire: This is the second Death.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="003009_0016_0FF0283E1D88EDA8"/>
AFTER this manner I might probably have ended my <HI>Discourse;</HI> leading the <HI>Godly</HI> into the <HI>New Hea∣vens wherein shall dwell Righteousness,</HI> Peace, Purity and perfect <HI>Order,</HI> and leaving the <HI>wicked</HI> in their place of everlasting-Misery, disorder and Confusion; <HI>Where there is weeping and wailing, and gnashing of Teeth.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the sad and dismal DISORDER, which the righteous GOD permitted to fall out among us the <HI>last Week,</HI> horrible to mention, and to be bewailed with <HI>Tears of blood,</HI> leads me into a more particular <HI>Address</HI> unto our <HI>Young People,</HI> and to their <HI>Elders</HI> with them; that the like abominable and detestable <HI>Disorder</HI> may never again be heard of among us, by the Will of GOD.</P>
<P>SEE, see my <HI>beloved Hearers,</HI> a criminal <HI>Disorder</HI> big with the most hainous <HI>Guilt,</HI> and tragical <HI>Death!</HI> See the hasty and cursed Fruit of criminal <HI>Disorders,</HI> in the <HI>double Murder</HI> of a late hopeful and promising <HI>Youth,</HI> who was heretofore of Us, a <HI>Child</HI> of great Expectation; but he went out from us, and ran him∣self into the Paths of the Destroyer and an untimely Death. See what a disorderly Conduct may presently bring the most sober, discreet and well tempered of our Children to; if as they grow up they abandon the good Rules and orderly Ways of Virtue and Piety, wherein they have been educated and instituted by their good Parents and Guardians, and run themselves into the Corruptions that are in the World thro' lust.</P>
<P>LET me therefore take this sad Occasion with a heavy Heart, to warn our Young People in the Name and Fear of GOD, against bloody &amp; unnatural <HI>DUELS</HI> and all the train of vicious Courses that lead to it; to a miserable End here, and to a fiery Hell for ever.</P>
<P><HI>DUELS</HI> are the <HI>Devil</HI> all over, who was <HI>the Murderer from the beginning;</HI> and as they come of him, so they represent him to the life, in all his Dis∣obedience and Enmity to GOD, and in all his Pride, Rage, and bloody Hatred of the life of Man. <HI>Duels</HI> are both kinds of <HI>Murder</HI> united: There's the Murder of a Mans <HI>Self</HI> in it, and the Murder of his <HI>Nei'bour</HI> al∣so: And alas! as there is the Murder of the <HI>Body</HI> in
<PB N="15" REF="003009_0017_0FF0283FFA6D0800"/>it, so of the <HI>Soul</HI> also. In every <HI>Duel</HI> Men fly in the face of GOD, <HI>the Lord of Life, the</HI> GOD <HI>of the Spi∣rits of all Flesh, the</HI> GOD <HI>in whose hand our Breath is;</HI> and who has given no Man power over his <HI>own</HI> Life, no more than leave to <HI>Kill</HI> his Nei'bour; but has forbid both on pain of the greatest Damnation.</P>
<P>BUT I hope I need not use many words to give our Young People <HI>horror</HI> at the Tho't of this Crime; the <HI>Tragedy</HI> of the last week will of it self do this, I trust. Let me therefore rather warn them, of those ungodly <HI>Lusts</HI> and brutal devilish <HI>Vices,</HI> which lead Men into furious DUELS: And as you would shun the <HI>Effect,</HI> dread the fatal <HI>Causes.</HI></P>
<P>AND first, <HI>Drinking.</HI> Few of our People are like to fall into any such <HI>Crime,</HI> as DUELS, till they have debauch'd themselves with drinking Companions. <HI>Wine is a Mocker, strong Drink is raging;</HI> as <HI>Solomon</HI> admonishes us: And in the wisdom of GOD he cau∣tions and exhorts the young Man; Prov. 23.19, 20, 29. <HI>Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine Heart in the way: Be not among Wine-bibbers, among riotous Eaters of Flesh: For who hath wo? who hath sor∣row? who hath Contentions? who hath Bablings? who Wounds without cause? they that tarry long at the Wine, they that go to seek mixt Drink.</HI></P>
<P><HI>CHILDREN,</HI> Beware of forming your selves into nightly or daily <HI>Tavern-clubs;</HI> or even into such weekly or monthly Societies, for meeting &amp; spending your Evenings in drinking together and gaming; whether at home or abroad. <HI>It is not for you,</HI> our Sons, <HI>no it is not for you, to drink wine and strong drink; lest you drink and forget the Law &amp; Covenant of the</HI> LORD <HI>your</HI> GOD, and run into every excess and riot. <HI>Give the strong Drink to him that is ready to perish, and the wine to them that be of heavy Hearts.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GAMING</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> incite and inflame to <HI>Duels.</HI> So it was in the <HI>late</HI> lamented Calamity. What a hideous <HI>Story</HI> is it? for Children that are beginning the World, it may be before they have fifty or sixty Pounds to show of their own getting, by the favour of GOD in a lawful and industrious way; to raffle away
<PB N="16" REF="003009_0018_0FF0282A74CB6568"/>such a Sum in a loose and careless Night! No account can be given for such a piece of Distraction, if the <HI>Bottle</HI> did not stand by and first take away the Sense &amp; Rea∣son. And then the <HI>Passion</HI> rises at the Loss, before or after the Wine is out, and the inward Vexation pro∣duces fierce Words, foul Names, Cursing &amp; Bitter∣ness, Hatred &amp; Revenge, and the Heat ends in one another's <HI>Blood.</HI></P>
<P>WILL you not say, <HI>my Son! Come not into their Company O my Soul, for in their Rage they slew a Man.</HI> It is the play of <HI>Abner,</HI> (only they were Enemies in open War) when he said to <HI>Joab, Let the young Men arise to play before us,</HI> twelve against twelve, <HI>and they caught every one his Fellow by the head, and thrust his Sword into his Fellows side, and fell down together.</HI> Such Murderous Fellows and Companions are <HI>Game∣sters</HI> like to prove, if GOD restrain not the <HI>Devil</HI> from a full Possession of them.</P>
<P>SAY not, <HI>foolish Child,</HI> There is no such danger from <HI>us</HI> and <HI>our</HI> Gaming together: Why not as much as there is found to have been in the late <HI>bloody Game</HI> that has put the Town in Mourning? <HI>Leave off Strife,</HI> and so Drinking and Gaming, <HI>before it be medled with;</HI> which is <HI>Solomon</HI>'s advice; meaning <HI>that we never begin</HI> or venture on in such Courses, whereof we know not the <HI>End,</HI> and think not the <HI>Tendency</HI> of them.</P>
<P><HI>LEWDNESS</HI> often accompanies the Glass and the Game. The <HI>harlot's House</HI> may be the place of the Game; and <HI>her House takes hold of Hell, and leads down to the Chambers of Death. Duels</HI> have often been fought in the cause of a <HI>Strumpet,</HI> and Blood has been often shed and Lives sacrificed to the fury of Lust. Prov. 2.28. <HI>Her House inclineth unto Death, and her Paths unto the dead.</HI> 5.4. <HI>Her End is bitter as Worm∣wood, sharp as a two edged</HI> SWORD; <HI>her feet go down to Death, her steps take hold of Hell.</HI> 7.25. <HI>She hath cast down many wounded, and strong Men have been</HI> SLAIN <HI>by her.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word, As you wou'd avoid <HI>Duels</HI> and <HI>Blood∣shed,</HI> shun <HI>Drinking,</HI> shun <HI>Gaming,</HI> beware of <HI>Drunk∣enness</HI> and <HI>Whordom,</HI> beware of <HI>Pride</HI> &amp; <HI>Haughtiness,</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="003009_0019_0FF02828D8322338"/>beware of <HI>Passion,</HI> beware of <HI>Swearing &amp; Cursing</HI> and profane speaking, and beware of <HI>Sabbath-breaking,</HI> which insensibly betrays Men into one <HI>violent</HI> Way and End and another, as many have confessed at the <HI>Gallows:</HI> Beware also of the <HI>Contempt of Superiors,</HI> and of breaking <HI>loose</HI> from the Admonitions &amp; Restraints of your wise and loving Parents: <HI>For the Eye that mocketh at his Father and refuseth to obey his Mo∣ther, the Ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young Eagles shall eat it.</HI></P>
<P>IN an especial manner, Let the <HI>Sons</HI> of this Country, and of these Churches beware of <HI>these</HI> Sins of <HI>Sabbath-breaking,</HI> and of <HI>Disobedience to Parents,</HI> and of <HI>for∣saking</HI> the good Ways &amp; Principles wherein they have been educated &amp; institured, either in point of Doctrine, Worship or Manners. Let them beware of <HI>forsaking the Guide of their Youth,</HI> and of <HI>fogetting the Covenant of their GOD, lest Strangers devour them,</HI> and they <HI>give their Years to the cruel.</HI> It is a dreadful word of GOD to the Children of his People, 1 Chron. 28.9. <HI>If thou seek him he will be found of thee, but if thou forsake him He will cast thee off for ever.</HI></P>
<P>YOU see <HI>Children</HI> this day, what comes of <HI>leaving these Chruches</HI> after an Education in them: Even Duel∣ling &amp; Bloodshed &amp; Flight from Country &amp; Friends, may come of <HI>bursting the Bonds of GOD</HI> asunder, and <HI>going after Strangers,</HI> and into the Manners, Cus∣toms and impious <HI>Maxims</HI> of the World.</P>
<P>RETURN, distracted and besotted <HI>Children! return and save your selves from this untoward Generation. Forsake the foolish &amp; live, and walk in the way of Under∣standing.</HI> The ways of Sin are nothing but Disorder and Misery, the way of Godliness, Righteousness and Sobriety is the Way of Order, Safety and Felicity. <HI>Let Wisdom enter into thy Heart, &amp; Knowledge be plea∣sant to thy Soul; Discretion shall preserve thee, Under∣standing shall keep thee: To deliver thee frow the way of the evil Man, from the Man that speaketh froward things, who leave the paths of Uprightness, to walk in the ways of Darkness; whose ways are crooked, and they are froward in their Paths.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="003009_0020_0FF028432B388F58"/>
LET <HI>Solomon</HI> tell you the Tendency of wicked Com∣pany unto <HI>Bloodshed:</HI> Prov. 1.10,—19. <HI>My Son, if Sinners entice thee, consent thou not: — Their seet run to Evil, &amp; make haste to shed Blood: — They lay wait for their own Blood, they lurk privily for their own Lives: so are the wayes of every one that is greedy of Gain, which taketh away the Life of the Owners thereof.</HI></P>
<P>I turn me now to the <HI>Elders</HI> of my People, to <HI>Pa∣rents</HI> and <HI>Masters,</HI> and the worshipful <HI>Justices of the Peace;</HI> and also to <HI>the Keepers of Public Houses;</HI> in a few words.</P>
<P>LET <HI>Parents</HI> carefully educate &amp; instruct &amp; charge their Children, restrain and govern them, rebuke and correct what is Evil in them, and encourage them in what is virtuous &amp; pious and praise worthy. Make'em to know that they depend upon you, and ought to <HI>sub∣mit</HI> unto you in the LORD; and must do so if they will have your Favour, Countenance &amp; open Hand. While the <HI>Mother</HI> adjures them from evil Companions, <HI>What, my Son! and what the Son of my Womb! and what, the Son of my Vows!</HI> Let the <HI>Father</HI> command &amp; forbid them on pain of his highest Displeasure, and on pain of GOD'S, which is infinitely greater.</P>
<P>INDULGE not their Vanity &amp; Corruption in seeking to feed <HI>as Lambs in a large Place,</HI> which is the first step to their running wild into the <HI>Woods,</HI> to be devour'd there by the <HI>Beasts of Prey.</HI> Have no hand, no not by criminal Easiness &amp; Gentleness, like <HI>Eli,</HI> in their <HI>ma∣king themselves vile;</HI> lest GOD be provoked to <HI>judge</HI> both You and them. Have no hand (shall I say) in their <HI>Blood;</HI> that of their Bodies, nor that of their Souls: But if they will come unto dreadful <HI>Ends,</HI> let their <HI>Blood</HI> be upon their own heads.</P>
<P><HI>TWO</HI> things let me beseech of <HI>Parents</HI> &amp; Heads of Families: <HI>One</HI> is that they frequent not <HI>Taverns</HI> them∣selves, which will certainly encourage your <HI>Sons</HI> to do the like, while they want your Years &amp; Prudence whereby to govern themselves in such a Liberty. The <HI>other</HI> thing I would entreat is, Not to suffer <HI>Cards</HI> or <HI>Dice</HI> in your Houses, nor take the liberty to play those insnaring and
<PB N="19" REF="003009_0021_0FF02845DDAC3CB8"/>Inchanting <HI>Games</HI> before your Children. You will herein consult the good Order, Virtue &amp; Religion of your Housholds, your Happiness in your Children, their Preservation from &amp; thro' an evil World, and your own Peace living &amp; dying.</P>
<P>BUT from <HI>private Houses</HI> let me step into those that are <HI>public,</HI> and drop a Word of <HI>Counsel</HI> &amp; <HI>Warning</HI> to the <HI>Inn</HI> &amp; <HI>Tavern Keepers.</HI> We beseech You not to suffer Persons or Companies to sit <HI>idling, tipling</HI> and much less <HI>gaming</HI> and carousing in your Houses. You know the <HI>Laws</HI> of GOD, and good <HI>Orders</HI> of Men in this <HI>Case;</HI> but if you escape the Cognizance of the <HI>Magistrate</HI> and Officers of our Peace, you cannot escape the Notice &amp; Judgment of GOD. May the <HI>Blood</HI> of dissolute Youths never come upon any of your Houses, by your indulging them in evil &amp; forbidden Prac∣tices, and at forbidden Hours. It calls for a great deal more Virtue, Courage and Prudence, to keep a <HI>Tavern</HI> well, then we are ready to think of.</P>
<P>BUT the Care of <HI>public Houses</HI> belongs also to the MAGISTRATES, <HI>Justices</HI> &amp; <HI>Officers</HI> in the <HI>Town,</HI> to whose Wisdom and Prudence, Integrity and Fidelity, I commend it in the Fear of GOD. <HI>The Earth and all the Inhabitants of it</HI> would <HI>dissolve,</HI> if good <HI>Rulers</HI> did not in their Legislative and Executive Power, <HI>hold up the Pillars thereof.</HI> Let it strengthen your Hands to know, that you are ministring to the Honour of GOD and the good <HI>Order</HI> of the World; the common Happiness and Peace of Mankind.</P>
<P>LET the Wicked be <HI>afraid</HI> of the POWER; for <HI>He beareth not the Sword in vain;</HI> but is <HI>the Minister of GOD, a Revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doeth Evil.</HI> But let the lovers of Peace and Right and Order reverence and <HI>love</HI> the POWERS which GOD has <HI>ordained; For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works, but to the evil: Do that which is Good and thou shalt have praise of the same. Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake.</HI></P>
