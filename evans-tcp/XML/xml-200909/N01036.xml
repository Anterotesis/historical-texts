<P><HI>John Rogers,</HI> a Servant of Jesus Christ, to the ten Virgins, Grace and Peace be unto you, from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ, who hath loved us and washed us from our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in his own Blood; and hath made us heirs with himself of that eternal Kingdom, which he by birth is an heir born unto; being the only begotten Son of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Father, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the first that rose from the dead, and is ascended far above all Dianity whatsoever, being the Prince of the Kings of the Earth and hath made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father, and we shall reign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the earth? To him b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> glory and dominion forever, and ever, Amen.</P>
<P><HI>Beloved Brethren,</HI> I have written unto you in this following Treatise,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Concerning the one only true God, distinguished into Three, according unto his Properties.</P>
<P>And <HI>Secondly,</HI> concerning the state of the two <HI>Adams,</HI> with the two Ministrations, handed down from them to us their Chil∣dren; the first Ministration proceeding from the Tree of Knowledg and Death to us, the second Ministration proceeding from the
<PB N="2" REF="001233_0003_0FB13479C3F89230"/>Tree of Life to us; by the first came the knowledge of the Law, and by the second life from the dead.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> concerning the several Ministrations of Water Baptism, and what the use and end of them was, and is, to∣gether with the Lords Supper, and what it points at.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Fourthly,</HI> a description both of a dead and living Faith.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Fifthly,</HI> how that Jesus Christ is our King, Priest and Prophet, and how that these several Offices of his, is both seen and felt, by every one that is born of God; so that they do not believe him to be so, only from the report of the Scriptures, but they are eye and ear witnesses of the truth of the Scripture, by seeing his several Offices operating and working in them, both by a sensible seeing, hearing and feeling: And how that all others that make a profession, and meddle with his Ordinances, are Anti∣christ and false Prophets, who deceive the world and themselves, being Ministers only of the Letter.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Sixthly,</HI> concerning the Christian Sabbath, or Gods seventh day Rest, which Jesus Christ, through faith, bringeth us into.</P>
<P>And, <HI>Seventhly,</HI> an exposition upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cor. 11.4 shewing that that Covering is

<P>And, <HI>Lastly,</HI> concerning Marriage and Divorce, with all things relating thereun∣to, by Scripture Testimony, without regard to any other Law or Custom whatsoever.</P>
<P><HI>Breth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn,</HI> tho' I have written to you at Mid-night, yet my lamp was well trimmed, so that it gave me a clear light to write by; for I have not been slumbering and sleeping, and thereby neglecting the triming of my Lamp; for if I had so done, it would have given me but a dull light; and therefore as I have been thorowly awake, and my lamp well trimmed, so that it gave me a clear light in my writing to you; so I desire you not to go about the reading of it, be∣tween sleeping and waking, and while your lamps want triming; for then you will nei∣ther have light enough to see what you read, nor your sences wake enough to understand it; &amp; so by this means you may pass a dream∣ing judgment against me and it, that may injure your selves, not knowing whether i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be a Voice founded before the Bridegroom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> face or not, and so he may come upon you as a thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in the night, while you are slum∣bering and sleeping, and your vessels empty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and your lamps ready to go out,
<PB N="4" REF="001233_0005_0FB1347CA3E894C8"/>Awake, Awake, therefore, and arise tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up your lamps, that you may be in a readi∣ness to enter in with the Bridegroom to the Marriage of the Lamb; for some will be unprepared, and while they go to buy Oyl the door will be shut, and then they will call and say, <HI>Lord, Lord, open unto us;</HI> but he from within, will answer and say, <HI>Verily I know you not from whence you are;</HI> then will they begin to say, We have taught in thy name, and cast out devils in thy name, and done many wonderful works, in thy name: but he will profess unto them, <HI>I never knew you, depart from me, ye workers of Iniquity.</HI> Then shall they see many come from the East, and from the West, and from the North, and from the South, and sit down with <HI>Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,</HI> in the Kingdom of God; but these, the Children of the Kingdom, shall be shut out in outer darkness; &amp; therefore faith our Lord, Strive to enter in at the strai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> gate; for many, I say unto you, shall seek to enter in, and shall not be able.</P>
<P>Friends and Brethren, I have found it no small matter, to enter in at the strait gate and to keep the narrow way that leads unto life, for it bath lead me to forsake a dear Wife and Children, yea, my house and land, and all my worldly enjoyments, and not
<PB N="5" REF="001233_0006_0FB1347FA17DDA40"/>only so, but to lose all the friendship of the world, yea, to bury all my honour and glory in the dust, and to be counted the off-scouring and filth of all things; yea, the strait and narrow way hath lead me into Prisons, into Stocks, and to cruel Scourgings, mockings and derision, and I could not keep in it without perfect Patience under all these things; for through much Tribulation must we enter into the Kingdom of God; for it is written, All that will live Godly in Christ Jesus must suffer persecuti∣on; and it is he only that overcometh that shall be crowned with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lory, and therefore no man warring in this war-fair ought to entangle himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a Souldier.</P>
<P>I have been a listed Souldier under his banner, now about thirty two years, under him whose name is called the Word of God; who is my Captain and Leader, that warreth against the Devil and his Angels, against whom I have sought many a sore battle within this thirty two years, for refusing to subject to the said Devil or Dargons Laws, Ordinances, Institutions and Worship; and for disregarding his Ministers, for which transgressions, I have been sentenced to pay hundreds of Pounds; laid in Iron Chains,
<PB N="6" REF="001233_0007_0FB13481DFFC85B8"/>cruelly scourged, enoured long Imprison∣ments, set in the stocks many hours toge∣ther, out of the bounds of all human Law, and in cruel manner, And thus after the war had continued, and been carried on twenty years, and I under these Tryals still, I was sentenced to pay a fine of twenty shillings, or continue in the Prison till I did, for prophaining the Dragons Sabbath, which they ignorantly call Gods Sabbath; and tho' it be true that he is the God of this world, and that the Sabbath he sets up, is the Sabbath of the God of this World, yet I knowing in my self, that he was not my God, and that if I should be subject to his Ordinances and Institutions of worship, I should offend my God in so doing; and con∣sidering, as I was in the Prison, that he made an offensive War against me, <HI>I</HI> not being one of his kingdom, and that I was able to engage war against him, and against all his power, I being on the strongest side, and considering who was my Captain and Leader, and how well he had armed me for the battlel, I thought it my wisdom, to make open proclamation of war against him, ac∣cordingly I did in writing, and hung it out on a board at the Prison Window, but kept no Copy of it, but strangely met with a Copy of it, many years after, and here followeth a Copy of it,</P>

<PB N="12" REF="001233_0013_0FB1348C62AF16E0"/>with a Halter about my neck; and from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ence to the Prison again, and there to continue till I paid the said five Pounds, and give in a b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd of fifty Pounds not to disturb their Chu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ches; where I continued three years and 8 months from my first commit∣ment.

Whereupon the Authority gave order forthwith, that no person should go with me to the Gallows save but the Guard: The Gallows was out of the Town; when I came to it, I saw that both Gallows and Ladder were newly made; I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ept up the ladder, and walked on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>allows, it being a great square piece of timber, and very high, I stamped on it with my feet, and told them I came there to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mp it under my feet; for my Lord had Suffered on the Gallows for me, that I might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sape it.

I told them, No, they were cruel Wretches; forthwith they sentenced me to be whipt a second time; I was told by the spectators that they gave me sixteen Stripes; and from thence I was carried to the Prison again; and one leg chained to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill; a Bed which I had hired to this time, at a dear rate, was now taken from me by the Goaler, and not so much as straw to lie on, nor any covering, the flower was hollow from the ground, and the planks had wide and open joynts; it was upon the eighteenth day of the eight Month that I was thus chained, and kept thus chained six weeks, the weather cold; when the Goa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er first chained me <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e brought some dry crusts in a dish, and put them to my mouth, and told me, he that was ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uted that day had left them, and that he would make me thankful for them before he had done with me, and would make me comply with their Worship, before he had

<P>Our first Parents while in an innocent state, had not the knowledge of good and evil, which knowledge was the light of the spiritual law of God; for their first sin was a transgression in the figure; but immedi∣ately upon that transgression, the eyes of them both were opened; but an opened eye cannot see, without light, for whatso∣ever

<PB N="36" REF="001233_0037_0FB134B5282FEEF0"/>death came by the first <HI>Adam</HI> both tempo∣ral and spiritual; so likewise a Resurrecti∣on from the dead, comes by the second <HI>Adam,</HI> both spiritual and temporal.</P>
<P>In a word, the two Trees in the midst of the garden of God represented the state of the two <HI>Adams,</HI> and their Posterity; the Tree of Knowledge, represented the ministration of the Law, to the first <HI>Adam,</HI> and from him, to his posterity, that by it we might understand what state he stood in, even under the Law, by which Law came the Knowledge of Sin; and so death by sin. The Tree of Life represented the state of the second <HI>Adam,</HI> by whom we have received the Attonement, whereby we have not only the remission of our sins past, but by him we are thorowly reconciled to God, and have the assurance given us of eternal life, and all through free Grace: So that both Ministrations come from the same God; as thus, The Law from a King will never save the life of a Traytor, yet this law gives light to all his Subjects, to teach them their duty, of Subjection to their King; but the Kings Law may be the death of many a Traytor; but the same King, out of his free grace and mercy, may send forth a Pardon by the hand of his Son, under his hand and seal, to save the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arytor
<PB N="37" REF="001233_0038_0FB134B666F33CB8"/>from the Justice of his Law; but these are two Ministrations from one King, and two contrary acts; the one on purpose to kill the Traytor, the other on purpose to save him alive, and the knowledge o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the first, will not make known the second; the first Ministration of the Law, is a Tree of Knowledge and death to the Traytor; the second Ministration is a tree of life to the Traytor; for in the first, nothing is to be seen, but the Cherubims and flami<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of Gods Justice, to put in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the breach of his Law.</P>

<P>And that Garden in <HI>Eden</HI> doth set forth the happy state of Innocency; for Innocen∣cy is a garden of pleasure, tho' upon the Cross with Christ; for there the Cherubims and Flaming Sword cut down the Innocent for our sakes, that we the guilty might escape; for he was numbered with the Transgressors. And thus by him we return into the garden, and take of the Tree of Life, and eat, by which means we come to escape the second death; seeing the Cheru∣bims and Flaming Sword hath cut him off, out of the land of the living, so that our body of sin, or old man, is crucified by the crucifying of the Innocent upon the Cross for us.</P>
<P>The first <HI>Adams</HI> innocent and glorious state was envied by that fallen Angel, who was more Subtil then any beast of the field; and he hath obtained the name of a serpent,
<PB N="39" REF="001233_0040_0FB134B98B0628A8"/>because he hath with his poysonous Sting given the first <HI>Adam</HI> and his Posterity a mortal wound, and is become the God of this world, ruling Lord and king in them, having gotten the power of death over them; but God be thanked, that we have gotten the victory through Jesus Christ our Lord; so that we can now say, <HI>O death! where is thy sting? O Grave! where is thy victory?</HI></P>
<P>And the river that went out of <HI>Eden</HI> to water the garden, represents the River of the Water of Life, as clear as Cristal, which proceeds from the Throne of God, and of the Lamb, and waters the tender plants of Gods garden, and makes them grow and be fruitful.</P>
<P>The Sum of the mater is this; <HI>Adam</HI> was made in the image of God, and all things put under his feet, and he himself subject∣ed under a Law; the punishment of the breach of it was a dispossession of his hap∣piness, with a temporal Death that was to follow, and so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring him to the dust again, out of which he was taken; He transgrest, sentence was past upon him, and he turned out of Paradise, and sent forth to till the ground, till the extent of his punishment was ins<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon him: Cherubims and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> sword were set to keep the way of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Life, that he
<PB N="40" REF="001233_0041_0FB134BCF4814CA8"/>might know of a certainty that he was a Son of death after this his first transgression was committed; the Tree of Knowledge ministred unto him a divine light, the eye of his spirit was opened, that by the light, he might see. Thus the spiritual Law of God was written in his heart, so that he knew what his duty was; in a word, he had the knowledge both of good and evil in himself, he is now beco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e his own keeper; God appoints another head, in his stead, who was the promised Seed of the Woman that should be of his seed; and thus the elder was to serve the younger; the younger is the man whom God hath appointed to judge the first <HI>Adam,</HI> and all his Posterity; by this knowledge of his law, ministred to <HI>Adam,</HI> by the fruit of the tree of know∣ledge: Now if <HI>Adam</HI> comes to commit a second sin, it must be against this spiri∣tual law, written in his heart; the punish∣ment of it is the second death; his judge is Jesus Christ; the time of his tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al and judgment, will be, when the execution of his first sin is ended, then shall he rise out of the dust to judgment, and come be∣fore his Judgment seat; the judge will be Jesus Christ; the Law which he will judge by, will be the Light in him, or law written <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, his Accuser will be his own

<P>Now on the contrary, <HI>Adam</HI> after his first sin, was enlightned with a divine light, so that he had the knowledge of his duty in himself, knowing both good and evil, he now following this light, so exactly, as not to transgress against it at any time; so tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his thoughts excuses him before the judg∣ment seat of Christ, and his Conscience with himself, bears witness, that he hath not rebelled against this light, then the Judge will say, <HI>Come then blessed, &amp;c.</HI> for thy reward is of debt, and not of Grace; But there is not a just man upon the earth, that doth good, and sinneth not; for if there were such a one, he stands in no need of a Saviour, for Christ did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.</P>
<P>In the next place, let us make enquiry, how shall <HI>Adam</HI> come to inherit eternal life, in the world to come, having sinned a second time? As to his first sin, there is no escaping the punishment of that, for sentence is al∣ready past, but as to his sinning against the light within, his sentence will be after the Resurrection of his body; in that world which is to come. Is there no means or way for him to escape that Sentence which
<PB N="42" REF="001233_0043_0FB134C01816B7B0"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to come? yea verily, there is, tho' his transgressions have been never so many, or never so great, but it must be through faith in the promised seed of the Woman, because <HI>Adam</HI> himself, had been Lord and King of this World, but now is brought into a state of mortality, by the subtilty of the serpent, who having disthron'd him, and gotten in∣to it himself, and is now become the God of this World, ruling in man, and so is become their head; but God having promis∣ed that the seed of the Woman, shall bruise his head, which victory Christ obtains thro' his divine power, who had power to lay down his life, and to take it up again; I say, that <HI>Adam</HI> through faith in this conque∣rour, (who also is the judge of the world to come) comes to obtain the Pardon and forgiveness of his sins past, and comes to be made partaker of Christs divine nature, and thus comes to be the Child of God by adoption, and through this faith he comes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o be purified in his inner man, and through this faith, he stands, and is kept by the mighty power of God working in him, being lead by a divine power, which he never had before, even by the Spirit of Truth, which is the life of that light, so that now he walketh in the light of life; for tho' the light and life be one in God, yet it
<PB N="43" REF="001233_0044_0FB134C1A6471668"/>was not so in <HI>Adam</HI> till now the two natures come to be united by faith in the promised seed. Thus <HI>Adam</HI> comes to have access to the Tree of Life, but it is through the death of his Mediatour; for the Cherubims and flaming Sword turn and execute the Justice of the Law (due to <HI>Adam</HI> for his sin) upon the innocent, as is writ∣ten, for Christ hath also once suffered for fins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit. Thus <HI>Adam</HI> sinned, and Christ suffered for it, being put to death in the flesh, that <HI>Adam</HI> migh be quickened by the Spirit, and this Spirit, is the fruit of the Tree of Life; thus the sinner comes to reap that which another soweth.</P>
<P>The Remission of our sins, comes through faith in the Blood of Jesus Christ, who hath received the promise of the spirit, and sent it in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o our hearts, by which spirit we are sanctified, and by which spirit our Justification from sin, though faith in his blood, is made known to us; for the spirit of life is the effect and fruit of the Tree of Life; and not one drop of the spirit is handed down to us, from the first <HI>Adam,</HI> nor any manifestation of our salvation by any light that comes that way; for it is
<PB N="44" REF="001233_0045_0FB134C32DD15308"/>by the tree of life that we come to have the light of life, and not by the tree of death, which is the tree of knowledg, or light of the law of God, handed to us from the first <HI>Adam;</HI> but the Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lamation of Gods free Grace to Sinners, is when and where, and to whom he is pleased to make it known; for the Election of God stands not in works of this spiritual law, after one transgression committed against it; for then a just judgment will follow, ex∣cept God of his own free grace is pleased to forgive the transgression; so that after transgression, the election stands in Gods choice; for if a king will chuse out a Tray∣tor from many, and forgive him, this is no wrong to the rest, neither ought their eye to be evil, because the King is good and merciful to his Enemy; for now the election stands in him that call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th, for it is now through free grace in Christ; for God never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore-ordained any man to damnation, but his judgment is just, for his transgres∣sing of the law, and Gods call to undone sinners, is by his own spirit, in his bride who faith, Come and take of the water of life freely.

<P>FOrasmuch as <HI>Adam,</HI> who was the head and first born of mankind, fell by trans∣gression, God was pleased to ordain another head of <HI>Adams</HI> seed, whom he appointed head of his Church, over all things under God, both in Heaven and in Earth, and hath chosen us in him, from the foundation of the world, and he being a second <HI>Adam,</HI> and a younger brother, God made known this his purpose to <HI>Adam,</HI> in his fall, by promis∣ing that the seed of the woman should bruise the Serpents head; and from that time forward, God pointed at him by signs an figures, to guide the saith of his Church to him her head, in whom she was chosen from the foundation of the world; and he being a second <HI>Adam,</HI> and younger Brother, was pointed at by <HI>Abel,</HI> not <HI>Cain;</HI> by <HI>Isaac,</HI> not <HI>Ishmael,</HI> by <HI>Jacob</HI> not <HI>Esau; David,</HI> not <HI>Saul,</HI> with many other signs and figures, before the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> was given; whose

<PB N="53" REF="001233_0054_0FB134D8B7A1D240"/>his Ministry, it would have been as the offering of strange fire, which the Lord commanded not; for the baptism of <HI>John</HI> was from heaven, &amp; proper only to himself to baptize, and not another, and all held John as a Prophet in power to that office particularly, and no other person; and therefore this was a Mystery, that neither <HI>Johns</HI> disciples, nor the <HI>Jews,</HI> could compre∣hend; and therefore <HI>Johns</HI> disciples repair to him, to inform him in the matter, that another was baptizing in the land of <HI>Judea,</HI> giving him an account who it was; for <HI>Johns</HI> Testimony of Christ was, that he that came after him should baptize with the holy-ghost, and with fire, which was the Baptism they expected would have followed <HI>Johns</HI> Baptism, according to <HI>Johns</HI> Testimo∣ny; but Gods ways are past finding out, till he discovereth them, for Gods pur∣pose was to proclaim the name of his belo∣ved Son in a higher degree than under Johns Ministry; but when they come to John, he quickly gives them light in the matter; for he was a burning and a shining light, his answer to them is <HI>v.</HI> 27. a man can re∣ceive nothing except it be given him from heaven: thus John soon opens the matter to them, that Christ the Son of God, had his authority from heaven, to impower his
<PB N="54" REF="001233_0055_0FB134DBC1489918"/>disciples to baptize in his name; and fur∣ther saith John to them, Ye your selves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but am sent before him, he is the Bride∣groom, and hath the Bride; I am his friend, and rejoyce to hear his voice; he must in∣crease, but I must decrease; the Father loveth the Son, saith he to them, and hath given all things into his hand. Thus John soon satisfieth his disciples, that Christ was the Son, and had power from heaven given him to impower his Servants to baptize in his name, yea, under this Commission, they did not only baptize, and preach in his name, but did all manner of Cures, and cast out Devils; for the Father glorified the Son, and gave all things into his hand, who had power to send forth his Apostles in his own name, to do all these things, to his glory and honour; and tho' the Apostle John calls this new ministration of Water Baptism, the Baptism of Christ, saying, Jesus Baptized with his disciples, &amp; that he baptized more disciples then John, and that all men came to his Baptism; yet it is to be understood, he did it by his Commission; for saith John at the end of the matter, Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples. So that we may see, God is still guiding the saith of his Church by outward signs,
<PB N="55" REF="001233_0056_0FB134DD513E5650"/>that their faith may be in their head, Christ Jesus, giving honour to him to whom all honour is due, as Son and Heir of all things; and this baptism was still to guide their faith aright to Christ as being already come, and suddainly upon it, under this Ministra∣tion, those mighty works did break forth, while John was in Prison; for as soon as John had heard by his disciples, that Christ had given Commission to others, his Mini∣stry d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>reast at once, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> cast into Prison; for Christ sends forth these in his own name, to Preach and Baptize, and to cure all man∣ner of Diseases, to cleanse the Leapers, raise the Dead, and to cast out Devils; and John heard of those mighty works in Prison, and sent two of his disciples to enquire whether they were done by him that was to come after him, whom he had preached, or by some other Prophet; but the Lord returned him a satisfying answer, That it was he. Then suddenly <HI>Herod</HI> beheaded John in Pri∣son, and immediately heard of these mighty works also, and said unto his servant, This is <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> he is risen from the dead, and therefore mighty works do shew forth themselves in him, but Christs same did still increase more and more, according to Johns Testimony, who said, I must decrease, but he must increase; for John did no miracle
<PB N="56" REF="001233_0057_0FB134DF61F73C78"/>under his Ministry; but Christs glory is set forth more and more, from one Ministrati∣on to another.</P>
<P>But the Spirit is not yet given forth, which <HI>John</HI> in his Ministry did point at, neither was it to be given, till Christ should be glorified with a Resurrection from the dead; for tho' the Father did glorifie the Son in Johns Ministry, with that lovely voice from heaven, and in the Apostles Ministry, with mighty signs and wonders, which they did in his name, yet in his Sufferings he was least in the Kingdom of Heaven; for he came nor for to be ministred unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.</P>
<P>Thus we have gone throw two Ministra∣tions of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, and both carried on under elementary figures, being signs of Sanctification by Jesus Christ, that the Master may have the glory alone, of the vertue or thing thereby signified, be∣cause it is divine, as he is divine, and com∣eth down from heaven, and therefore is to set forth his glory alone, who is the Lamb of God, and hath the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth; as John saith, I have need to be Baptized of thee.</P>
<P>After these two Ministrations, the Lord of life and glory was crucified for our sins,
<PB N="57" REF="001233_0058_0FB134E0798B8588"/>as before was said; he did not come to be ministred unto, but to minister, and to give his life a Ransom for many; and after, was raised for our Justification, and sudden∣ly upon his Resurrection, gave a new Com∣mission to his eleven Apostles, which was to be a standing Rule in his Church, till he should come a second time, as he was the Seed of <HI>Adam, Abraham</HI> and <HI>David,</HI> yea, in that body which was born of the Virgin <HI>Mary,</HI> and after crucified, dead and buried, but did not see corruption, being raised from the dead by the mighty power of God, tho' crucified through weakness, as he was the seed of <HI>Adam;</HI> yet now liveth by the Power of God, and will appear a second time, without sin unto Salvation; for in his first appearing, he was made sin for us, who knew no sin, that is to say, he was made a sacrifice for our sins, so that through this Sacrifice, we might be made the Righ∣teousness of God, but he will appear a second time, without sin unto salvation, that is, he will appear a second time &amp; deliver us from all Sorrow, Pain &amp; Misery whatsoever; yea, from Death it self: &amp; this will be the Sal∣vation that he will appear in a second time, &amp; hath settled in his Church stated Ordinan∣ces in his last Commission; still to guide the faith of his Church, that they may not be bewildered in their imaginations concern∣ing him.</P>

<P>This Translation all the latter Transla∣tors seem to agree unto, and therefore I mention it. In the first place let us ex∣amine, when and where this Order or Com∣mission was given unto them; where it was given, is to be seen in the 16 and 17 <HI>v.</HI> Then the eleven disciples went away into <HI>Galilee,</HI> into a Mountain, where Jesus had appointed them; and when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted.

Then said Jesus, all ye shall be offended because of me, this night, &amp;c. but after that I am risen again, I will go before you into <HI>Galilee:</HI> Compare this with the 28 Chap. 7 and 10 <HI>v.</HI> and they testifie, that very early on the first day of the week, while it was yet dark the Angel of the Lord, and the Lord him∣self, sent <HI>Mary Magdalen</HI> in great haste, to tell his disciples, that they should go
<PB N="59" REF="001233_0060_0FB134E4C0B5DAB0"/>into <HI>Galilee,</HI> there they should see him; which was the place he appointed to meet with them, the night in which he was be∣trayed: And in the 16. <HI>v.</HI> it is said, Then the Eleven disciples went away into <HI>Galilee</HI> into a Mountain, where Jesus had appoint∣ed them. And in the 18. <HI>v.</HI> it appears that there, and then, he gave them this Com∣mission. Thus is appears, that this Com∣mission was delivered to them in <HI>Galilee,</HI> and immediately upon their first sight of him after his Resurrection. In the next place, let us view the Commission, with the Orders and Promise annixt to it; <HI>first,</HI> They are to go under his Authority; <HI>second∣ly,</HI> they are to disciple the nations; <HI>thirdly</HI> to baptize them; and, <HI>fourthly,</HI> to teach them to observe all things which Christ had commanded them to teach; and, <HI>fifthly,</HI> A promise is joyned to the Com∣mission, to wit, that Christ himself will be with them alway, even unto the end of the world. From hence we may observe, that this promise is not made only to them; but to all that should after believe through their word, successively, even to the end of the world. In the next place, we are to consider, here is no account, what it was he did order them to teach the rati∣ons to observe, neither have we and ac∣count,
<PB N="60" REF="001233_0061_0FB134E5AFC5C838"/>what baptism this was that they were to baptize with; and those are neces∣sary things to know, and by the com∣mission it self we cannot know them; And tho' the Lord declared them to the Eleven Apostles in private, yet they were to make them publick to the whole world; and therefore we are to consider, we must come to know them by the Apostles Doc∣trine and Practice; for this was the way Christ did then intend to make them known by; the next thing in order to know what they did teach, &amp; with what baptism they did baptize with, is to come to their Ministration under this Commission, seeing that was the way Christ did then purpose to make it known by to the Nations.</P>
<P>I question, Whether they entred upon their Ministry, as soon as they received their Commission? <HI>Answer,</HI> No, for they received their Commission in <HI>Galilee,</HI> as be∣fore hath been proved; and immediately upon the Resurrection of Christ, but he assembled himself with them forty days after this, and commanded them to wait at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> for the promise of the Spirit, which <HI>John the Baptist</HI> fore-told of; saying, <HI>Is shall baptize you with the holy Ghost, and with Fire,</HI> Acts 1.4, 5. But, saith he, wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith
<PB N="61" REF="001233_0062_0FB134E716FEF680"/>he, ye have heard of me; for <HI>John</HI> truly baptized with Water, but ye shall be bap∣tized with the holy Ghost not many days hence. From hence we may observe, that Christ puts his Apostles in mind of that Promise, which the Father promised by <HI>John the Baptist</HI> concerning himself how that the Son should have that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> put upon him, as to baptize with the holy Ghost, and signifies it to his twelve Apostles that the time is now at hand, that John for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>told of, as in the <HI>8th. v.</HI> But ye shall receive power, after the holy Ghost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and in <HI>Judea,</HI> and in <HI>Samaria,</HI> and unto the uttermost parts of the earth. From hence it appears, that the Apostles themselves had need to be baptized by Christ, as well as John the Baptist.</P>
<P>Now while they were waiting at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with one accord, in one place, suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a rushing mighty Wind, and it filled all the house, where they were sitting; and there appeared unto them cloven Tongues, like as of fire, and it sat upon each of them; and they were all filled with the holy Ghost. This is the Baptism which John fore-told of; now we see they are endued with power from heaven, under a second Com∣mission
<PB N="62" REF="001233_0063_0FB134E942C0E520"/>to preach the Gospel to all the world, their first was only to the house of <HI>Israel;</HI> now in the prosecution of their Ministry, we shall come to see, what was before com∣manded to them in secret, in their Com∣mission, to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it, what they were command∣ed to tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and with what Baptism they were to Baptize with under this Com∣mission; for here is of all Nations under heave, prepared in a readiness, to hear the Doctrine, and to see with what Baptism they were commissionated to bap∣tize with, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that they may publish it throughout the whole world, even at the very in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>im of the time that they are im∣powered to enter into their Ministry, under the aforesaid Commission; and Johns Te∣stimony is fulfilled concerning Christs Bap∣tism, who baptizeth with the holy Ghost and with sire, before the eyes of all Nations under heaven. So that it appears, he that gave the Commission, baptizeth with the holy Ghost and with Fire, according to Johns Testimony; but what Baptism they that were commissionated to baptize, it doth not yet appear what it was with, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.14, But <HI>Peter</HI> standing up with the Eleven [Note, it is a mutual voice] and said unto them, Hear these words, Jesus a man ap∣proved of God, ye have taken and by wicked
<PB N="63" REF="001233_0064_0FB134EA47C739E8"/>hands have <HI>crucified,</HI> whom God hath raised up where of we all are witnesles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart, &amp; said unto <HI>Peter,</HI> &amp; to the rest of the Apostles, (note this that they enquire of <HI>Peter</HI> &amp; of the rest of the Apostles, what their duty is, accordingly they give them a particular account, <HI>First,</HI> To Repent, and <HI>Secondly,</HI> To be baptized, every one of them, in the name of the Lord, for the Remission of sins; and, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Apostles make an abso∣lute promise unto them, that upon these terms they shall receive the gift of the holy Ghost. Here it appears plainly, what Doc∣trines they were ordered to preach, and what Baptism they were ordered to Baptize with, under this Commission; for now they have discovered it to all nations under hea∣ven at once. <HI>First,</HI> As to their Doctrine, they preach a crucified Christ to them, and testifie to them, that God hath raised him from the dead; and that they are his wit∣nesses of the truth of it; this is their Doc∣trine which they go to disciple them into the belief of; and it is such a Doctrine which was never before preacht, which Doctrine did prick them to their hearts, and made them cry out to know what was required of them to do? The Apostles an∣swer is, Repent, and, <HI>Secondly,</HI> be baptised
<PB N="64" REF="001233_0065_0FB134EC8E3F27E0"/>in the Name of Jesus Christ, for the Remis∣sion of Sins; and, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> the promise they the afore-mentioned things being done, they shall receive the gift of the holy Ghost. So that this Baptism which they were to baptize with, in this Commission, was such a Baptism, as they could baptize them with, before they received the holy Ghost; for the gift of the holy Ghost was that Baptism which the Apostles themselves were at this time baptized with, before their eyes, and is proper only to Jesus Christ to baptize with, who hath the Spirit without measure, and who alone can baptize with it. So that it appears, this Baptism which the Apostles were to Baptize with, under this Comission, was to guide their faith, in that doctrine which they taught them, to wit, in Christs death and Resurrection, by which faith they should come to obtain the Remission of their sins, and also come to receive the gift of the holy Ghost from him who alone is able to baptize with the Spirit, and thereby to seal to their Ministry and Apostleship. And we have here a further account that they which gladly received his Word, were baptized, and continued stedfastly in the Apostles Doctrine, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayer: Thus they taught them, as they were ordered in their Commission; for
<PB N="65" REF="001233_0066_0FB134EDDB003758"/>their order in their Commission, was, To teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you, saith Christ; and such as received their word, continued in their Doctrine steadfastly. And among other things, we have here an account, that they taught them the Ordinance of breaking of Bread, which was to be a guide to their Faith, that by the death of Christ, his Church comes to be fed with the Bread of Life from heaven, and is to continue in his Church, to shew forth his death till he comes, who hath purchased by his bitter Death, this living Bread sent down from heaven, to feed and nourish his Church with.</P>
<P>Seeing it was the purpose of our Lord to let all the world know, what Baptism they were commissionated to baptize with in this commission, by their publick Mini∣stry, let us therefore go on, and view what baptism they did baptize with, and their Successors, who had their information from the Apostles mouthes; for it was the Pro∣mise of Christ, in that Commission, to be with them, and with their Successors, in their Ministration, even unto the end of the world; so that we must be guided by their Doctrine and Practice, which is a standing Rule, which Christ hath set in his Church, even unto the end of the world.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="001233_0067_0FB134EF5B392978"/>
In the <HI>8th Chap.</HI> of the <HI>Acts,</HI> we have an accourt, that <HI>Phillip</HI> had an immediate Call of God, to the work of the Ministry, who was the Apostles Successor in their day and time, who had information from their Mouthes, what their Orders in that Com∣mission was, who followed their foot steps, came to <HI>Samarita</HI> and there preached the Gospel to them, and both men and women believed, and were baptised. Now when the Apostles which were at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> heard that the Samaritans had received the Word of God, they sent unto them <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> (these are the two chief of them, which received the orders and directons from Christs own Mouth, from whom Phil∣lip had his directions,) who when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might recive the holy Ghost; for as yet, he was fallen upon none of them, on∣ly they were baptized into the Name of the Lord Jesus; for so all the latter tran∣slators agree to, that it is the same word that is in the Commistion, to wit, into the Name of the Lord Jesus; so likewise, where <HI>Paul</HI> thanked God, he baptized only <HI>Crispus</HI> and <HI>Gaius</HI> of the <HI>Corinthians</HI> lest (saith he) any should say I had baptized into my own name, using the word <HI>into</HI> according to the Commission; so that it appears, these which
<PB N="67" REF="001233_0068_0FB134F0D6DD35E0"/><HI>Paul</HI> baptized with Water, and these which <HI>Phillip</HI> baptized before they received the holy Ghost, they both baptized them according to the Commission, to wit, <HI>into</HI> the Name of the Lord Jesus. Now both these Mini∣sters were Successors to the twelve Apostles being afterwards immediately called to preach the Gospel, and received this Ordi∣nance of Baptism, by tradition, from the Apostles, who delivered it to the Church by Christs order, to be a settled Ordinance, to guide the faith of the Church in Christs death, for the Remission of her sins, that the Church might not be bewildered in her imaginations, concerning the Remission of her sins, but might know it to be by the death of Christ, which Baptisin pointeth at; as will appear more evidently hereafter</P>
<P>So that by this Baptism, they baptized them into a profession of the Name of Jesus Christ, believing that the Remission of their sins came only and alone by the meritorious Death of Jesus Christ, by whom they are justified; and upon this Faith and Baptism Christ himself, as Saviour, bap∣tizeth them with the holy Ghost, by which Baptism he seals his name upon them; for it is he only that hath the Seal of the living God, and so seals us to the day of Re∣demption, by his holy Spirit; but not the Apostles, nor any other Minister.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="001233_0069_0FB13584922BF270"/>
And as I before said, when <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> were come down, they prayed for them (whom <HI>Phillip</HI> had before baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus, that is, into the faith of the Lord Jesus,) that they might recive the holy Ghost; for as yet he was fallen upon none of them, (saith the Scripture,) but only they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesns; then laid they their hands on them, and they received the holy Ghost. Thus was <HI>Phillips</HI> Ministry and Baptism confirmed by the Apostles, and Christ himself from Heaven, so that their Doctrine and Baptism under that Com∣mission, was confirmed to their Successors immediately from Heaven; and so <HI>Phillip</HI> goes on in his Ministry, by the immediate motion of the Spirit of God, and baptizeth the Eunuch, as is written, they both went down into the water and he baptised him.</P>
<P>And in the <HI>10th</HI> of the <HI>Acts,</HI> we have an account, that the Angel of the Lord appeare<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unto <HI>Cornelius,</HI> and bid him send for <HI>Peter,</HI> for (saith the Angel) he shall tell thee what thou oughtest to do. Thus we may observe, that the Apostles succes∣sors were to be informed of them, what they ought to do; for Christ delivered his Orders to them and directed their successors to receive them from their months; so that
<PB N="69" REF="001233_0070_0FB1358A167D33C0"/>what they did and taught, was Gods mouth to us; and the Orders they received, was immediate from Christs mouth. Now when <HI>Peter</HI> was come to <HI>Cornelius,</HI> he tells him how they slew Christ and hanged him on a Tree, and how that God raised him from the dead, and that they were his witnesses of these things; and while <HI>Peter</HI> was thus speaking, the holy Ghost fell on all them that heard him: Then answered <HI>Peter,</HI> Can any man forbid Water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the holy Ghost as well as we? and he com∣manded them to be baptized, in the Name of the Lord. From hence we may observe, That <HI>Cornelius</HI> was ordered to send for <HI>Peter</HI> to be informed what he ought to do; <HI>Secondly,</HI> when <HI>Peter</HI> was come to him, he preached Christ crucified to him and how God raised him from the dead, &amp;<HI>c.</HI> And, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> how that while <HI>Peter</HI> was speaking, the holy Ghost fell on all them that heard him. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> Let us take notice of <HI>Peters</HI> Answer, by way of question, Can any man forbid Water, saith he, that these should not be baptized, which have received the holy Ghost as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord. Here is two things observable; the <HI>first</HI> is, <HI>Peter</HI> useth it as an undeniable
<PB N="70" REF="001233_0071_0FB1358B56A46AD0"/>argument, that these ought to be baptized, seeing they had received the holy Ghost; and, <HI>Secondly,</HI> he that was sent of God, to teach them what they ought to do, com∣mands them with Authority to be baptized in the Name of the Lord, from whom he had his Comission to baptize; and this was immediately upon their entrance into their Office, under their last Commission; for in their first Commission, they were sent to preach and to baptize, only to the lost sheep of the house of <HI>Israel,</HI> but not to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as hath been already proved; but under this Commission, they are to preach and to baptize all Nations; and this <HI>Cornelius</HI> was the first of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> that <HI>Peter</HI> was sent to, under this Commission, immediate∣ly upon his receiving power to preach and baptize under it, as appears in the first of the <HI>Acts,</HI> 8. <HI>v.</HI> But ye shall receive Power, after the holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in <HI>Jer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣salem,</HI> and in <HI>Judea,</HI> and in <HI>Samaria,</HI> and unto the uttermost part of the Earth. In the 11th chap. of the <HI>Acts,</HI> it appears, that the Angel did not only bid <HI>Cornelius</HI> send for <HI>Peter,</HI> to be informed by him what he should do, but told him also, that <HI>Peter</HI> should speak words whereby he and all his house should be saved; which salvation was
<PB N="71" REF="001233_0072_0FB1358CE1161BA8"/>preached to him through Christ crucified; he readily believes the Doctrine, and God seals his Salvation to him, through this faith in Christs Blood; and Baptism is an Ordinance stated by God, to guide the faith of his Church in Christs Blood alone, for the remission of sins; and when <HI>Peter</HI> saw that the holy Ghost sealed to <HI>Cornelius</HI> his salvation, through faith in Christs Blood, said he, <HI>Can any man forbid Water?</HI> his words implyed, seeing our Authority un∣der Christs Commission to preach and to baptize, is seen to be from heaven, and therefore under this Commission, he com∣mands them with Authority to baptize.</P>
<P>And as to the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> tho' he was immediately called of God to preach the Gospel, (as all Gods Ministers are,) yet he was the Apostles Successor, and therefore must receive his orders successively; for he comes under the order of their Commission and therefore when the Lord first appeared unto him, <HI>Paul</HI> said, What shall I do Lord? and the Lord said unto him, arise, and go into <HI>Damascus,</HI> and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do. Thus he is ordered to receive his Directions from his Predecessors, they must be Christs mouth to him, which is agreeable to the Scriptures handing them
<PB N="72" REF="001233_0073_0FB1359144E1D120"/>down to us, from their mouth; for when <HI>Annanias</HI> came to him, to inform him what he should do, and had laid his hands on him so that he had received his sight, and was filled with the holy Ghost, why tarriest thou (saith <HI>Annania<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>) arise and be baptized, <HI>Acts</HI> 22.16. compared with <HI>Acts</HI> 9.17, 18. Thus it appears that baptism is a stated Ordinance in the Church, by Christs Com∣mission to his Apostles, and none since called in particular, immediately of God to baptize, tho' they are called of God im∣mediately to preach the Gospel; but it is to be practised as an Ordinance delivered to the Church, according to <HI>Pauls</HI> Testimony, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.2. Now I praise you Bretheren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the Ordinances, as I delivered them to you. Thus the Church of Christ, is to be in the practise of the Ordinances of Christ from the information of the Scriptures, as <HI>Cornelius</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> who were the Apostles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uccessors, were to be informed from the mouth of their Predecessours, concerning the Ordinances of Christ, so that <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his house were commanded to be bapti∣zed; but we have no account that <HI>Peter</HI> was the Person that baptized them, another might do it; so likewise <HI>Paul</HI> was command∣ed to be baptized, but we have no account
<PB N="73" REF="001233_0074_0FB13593CEC1F828"/>that <HI>Annanias</HI> was commanded to do it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> tho' he was Christs mouth to teach <HI>Paul</HI> the Ordinance, and to require him to arise and be baptized, as <HI>Peter</HI> was Christs mouth to <HI>Cornelius,</HI> and commanded him to be bap∣tized; so than they were Christs Mouth to shew them their duty: but some others might baptize them; for Baptism is a figure delivered to the Church, to point at Christs Death and Resurrection, by whom we have obtained remission of sins; and there is no vertue in it self, but it is a necessary figure, of our salvation by Christs Death; so that <HI>Paul</HI> might well say he was not sent to bap∣tize, but to preach the Gospel; for a necessity was laid upon him to do the one, but not the other: but it appears by <HI>Pauls</HI> words, that they were all baptized; for saith he, was <HI>Paul</HI> crucified for you? or were ye bap∣tized into the the Name of <HI>Paul?</HI> which speech is directed to every individual person in the Church of <HI>Corinth,</HI> as much to one as to another, and therefore imports, as Christ was crucified for them all, so they were all baptized into his Name, with thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> baptism, which he himself baptized so fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them with; and he gives the reason, why he thanks God he baptized no more of them, to wit, lest any should say that I had bap∣tized into mine own name; and we read
<PB N="74" REF="001233_0075_0FB1359519FAF870"/>frequently of <HI>Pauls</HI> baptizing in other places, all which shews, that that Institution of baptism, given in that Commission to the Apostles, was attended by the Churches of Christ, and <HI>Paul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> baptizing so few of the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> and yet his words shewing, that they were all baptised, doth manifest that it was a necessary thing to be done by the hands of others, and not to be omitted, and that it was attended duly by the Churches of Christ.</P>
<P>We have an account in <HI>Acts</HI> 19. that <HI>Paul</HI> found certain disciples, of whom he enqui∣red, Whether they had received the holy Ghost, fince they believed? and they an∣swered, they had not so much as heard whether there be any holy Ghost; and he said unto them, Into what then were ye baptised? From hence we may observe, that <HI>Paul</HI> understanding that they were Disciples, he took it for granted that they were bap∣tised, which shews is was a general practise in the Church, their answer to <HI>Paul</HI> is, With <HI>Johns</HI> Baptism; <HI>Pauls</HI> reply to them is, That <HI>John</HI> baptized unto Repentance, to believe on him who was to come after him, that was on Christ, saith he; and when they heard this, they were baptized into the Name of the Lord Jesus; and when <HI>Paul</HI> had laid his hands on them, the holy Ghost
<PB N="75" REF="001233_0076_0FB13596A182F2F0"/>came on them. Here we may observe, that <HI>Paul</HI> acts by the same Rule as <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> did; for when they heard that there was some that believed, and were baptized into the Name of the Lord Jesus, they went and laid their hands on them, and they re∣ceived the holy Ghost. And, no doubt but multitudes, that were baptized with <HI>Johns</HI> baptism, which was to believe on him which was to come after him, were after baptised into the Name of the Lord Jesus; for <HI>John</HI> was sent before to make ready a people for the Lord, and it is said, that all <HI>Judea,</HI> and <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> was baptised of <HI>John</HI> in the River of <HI>Jordan;</HI> and after when Jesus came into the Land of <HI>Judea,</HI> and tarried with his disciples, and baptised, it is said that all men came to him, and that he made and baptized more disciples than <HI>John,</HI> tho' he himself baptized not; for he did it by his Commission, and it is evident, that these were baptised into the Name of the Lord Jesus with Water by <HI>Paul,</HI> and that he af∣terwards laid his hands on them, and then they received the holy Ghost, <HI>Acts</HI> 19.5, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P>And the Apostel <HI>Peter,</HI> who was one of the eleven, to whom the Orders under that Commission was given, hath left in writing, a plain testimony concerning Water Bap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ism, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.21. The like figure

Whereas he saith, <HI>the like figure,</HI> he alludes from the Destruction of the old World, and the Salvation of <HI>Noah</HI> and his house by Water, which was a figure of the Churches Salvation by Christ, the promised seed to come, who was to be her head, and the Saviour of her Body; <HI>Baptism</HI> [saith he] <HI>is the like figure;</HI> so that he speaks of Baptism as it is a figure, deliver∣ed to the Chruch, now saveth us [saith he] that is, it is a figure of our salvation by Christ; he speaketh by the figure, as Christ, doth in the like case, when he gave his Disciples the Bread and Wine, which were but figures, saying, <HI>This is my Body which is broken for you; and</HI> when he gave them the Cup of wine, he said, <HI>This is my Blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many;</HI> yet these were but figures of his Body and Blood, as Baptism is a figure of our Salvation by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, not [saith <HI>Peter</HI>] the puting away of the filth of the flesh; that is, the figure only washeth the outward man, but we have the answer of a good Conscience by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, which Baptism
<PB N="77" REF="001233_0078_0FB13599DDCB22E0"/>is a figure of; but the washing of the filt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the flesh, is only the work of the figure, and the figure is to point out how we come by this Baptism, which cleanseth us from our sins; for it is not Sufficient for us to know, that it is the Spirit that bap∣tizeth us from out sins, but the main thing is to know how we came by the gift of the Spirit; and this knowledge is to be guided by the figure; for <HI>Peter</HI> telleth us in the 18. <HI>v.</HI> That Christ was put to death in the flesh, that he might bring us to God; for we come to cease from sin, by his Suffer∣ing in the flesh for us, 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4▪1. he also being quickened by the Spirit, and so raised from the dead, by th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Resurrection of his, the spirit flows from the head into the body, and cleanse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> us; and thus we come to have a good Conscience towards God, even by the Resurrection of Jesus Christ; so that our good Conscience comes by our Spiritual Baptism, and our Spiritual Baptism, comes by Christs Death and Resurrection, so that our good Conscience is the answer or eccho but not the voice, but the figure points at the voice, but not at the eccho, and there∣fore for any to say, I am baptized with the Spirit, I have no need of the figure, is great ignorance, under a high notion of a conceit∣ed knowledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, not yet seeing what the figure
<PB N="78" REF="001233_0079_0FB1359CD21618B0"/>points at; and it is a naked contradiction of plain Scripture Testimony; for when <HI>Paul</HI> had received his fight, and was filled with the holy Ghost, saith the Lord Jesus to him by the mouth of <HI>Annanias,</HI> whom he sent to direct <HI>Paul</HI> what to do, <HI>Why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized.</HI> And when the holy Ghost fell upon <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his house, the Lord Jesus commanded them (by the mouth of <HI>Peter,</HI> whom he sent to teach them what they ought to do), to be baptiz∣ed; and <HI>Peter,</HI> who was one of the Eleven under that Commission, makes a challenge, by way of question, saying, Can any man forbid Water, that these should not be baptized which have received the holy Ghost as well as we? And so he that the Lord sent to teach them what to do, upon this very reason, of seeing them baptized with the holy Ghost, commands them to be baptized, (and it is evident) with Water.</P>

<HEAD>What Baptism is a figure of, and how it ought to be Administred.</HEAD>
<P>BAptism as it is a figure, it is to guide our faith aright, that thro' our faith in the Death, Burial and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, we come to dye to sin, and are quickened or raised up together with him, to newness of life; for our body of sin is crucified, dead and buried, through the offering of the Body <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Jesus for us, so that we have a sight, sense and feelling in own selves, of what the holy Scriptures bears witness of, concerning Jesus Christ being that one sacrifice for sin, so that we can see to our seal to the truth of the Scripture<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="80" REF="001233_0081_0FB135A05B8307A0"/>by the vertuous effects (of the suffering of Jesus Christ) operating in us, through the application of the Spirit, which not only mortifies and kills sin in us; but also in his name it quickens, and raises us up to newness of life; so that the outward figure represents that the death and burial of our body of sin, comes by the death of Christ for our sins: so that his death, burial, and resurrection, with our death to sin, and re∣surrection out of a state of sin, into a state of righteousness, is repersented in this outward figure; as also the resurrection of the body, which also comes by Christ, is held forth by this outward figure, and therefore saith the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.3, 4, 6. <Q>Know ye not, that so many of us as w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death, therefore we are buried with him, by baptism, into death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead, by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life; knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l.</HI> 2.12. buried with him, in baptism, wherein ye are also risen with him, thro' the faith, of the operation of God; who hath raised him from the dead, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Else what shall they do, which are Baptized for

And also <HI>Israel</HI> was bap∣tized in the cloud, and in the sea, unto <HI>Moses;</HI> for they went down into the midst of the sea, the waters being a wall on their right hand, and on their left; and thus were they buried in the Cloud and in the Sea, in this baptism unto <HI>Moses,</HI> which was their salvation, held forth in that figure, for they were a figure of the New man, whose salvation came by the death, burial

Baptism is the like figure, which figureth out our salvation by Jesus Christ; our body of sin being dead and bu∣ried with him, who suffered for it on the cross, and also, we are raised together with him, to Newness of life; so that we have already gotten a good Conscience towards God, by having a part in the first Resur∣rection with Christ, who will be the judge of the second death.</P>
<P>Concerning the Lords Supper.</P>
<P>VVHen God delivered his people out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> he ordained an Ordi∣nance in his Church, called the Lords Pas∣sover; which Ordinante did point at Christ, who was the real Lamb of God, figured out by that Ordinance, which was to guide the faith of Gods Church to the promised seed of the Woman, till he should come; which Ordinance continued in the Church, till it was fulfilled in the Kingdom of God; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very night, in which Jesus eat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> he was be∣trayed,
<PB N="83" REF="001233_0084_0FB135A63AB76710"/>tho' he freely offered up himself for our sins, that he might redeem us from our vain Conversations; and in the time of his eating that Passover with his Disc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ples, he instituted a new Gospel Ordinance to guide the faith of his church in himself, as being already come, as the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> saith, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.7. for eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ our Pas∣sover is sacrificed for us, he having thus once appeared by the Sacrifice of himself, to put away sin, hath left an Ordinance with his Church, called the Lords Supper, to be observed by his Church, till he shall appear a second time, without sin unto salvation; for in his first appearance, he was made sin for us, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> knew no sin, that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. And all the Sacrifices for sin before his com∣ing, was to guide the faith of his Church, to this one Sacrifice, which they all pointed at, that the Church of God might believe and know, by these Ordinances before ap∣pointed of God, that God had ordained them another head, in the room of <HI>Adam,</HI> who by his disobedience, brought death and misery upon himself, and upon all hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Posterity, but by the righteous Life, bitter Death, and glorious Resurrection of this second <HI>Adam,</HI> a Resurrection from Sin, Misery and Death, is brought to light; so
<PB N="84" REF="001233_0085_0FB135A7EC78DB70"/>that this Lamb of God, is the one and only sacrifice for our sins, as the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> saith 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.18. for as much as ye know, that ye were not redeemed with corrupti∣ble things, as Silver and Gold, from your vain Conversation, but with the precious Blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without blemish, and without spot, who verily was fore-ordained before the foundation of the world, yea, God chose us in him our head, before the foundation of the world, and by his free grace called us in him, that we should be holy, by being made partaker of that holiness, which was with him before the foundation of the world was laid, and therefore the Lamb of God, that was sacri∣ficed for us, is worthy to receive Power, and Riches, and Wisdom, and Honour, and Glory, and Strength, for he was slain for us, and hath purchased for us the true and living bread of life, yea, God the father hath sealed our salvation to us, by the Blood of this Lamb of God. And our Lord Jesus Christ, (at the cessation of that Passover, which was to guide the faith of his Church in him that was to come, till he should come and fulfill that Ordinance in the Kingdom of God, by the sacrifice of himself,) hath settled a New-Testament Ordinance in his Church; to shew forth his
<PB N="85" REF="001233_0086_0FB135A9570AE148"/>death till he shall come a second time in glory; which Ordinance is to shew, that his Church hath the remission of sins by the sheding of his Blood, and to shew and to keep in memory, that the Bread of Life, which is given us, is purchased for us by his bitter death; this is the end of Christs settling this Ordinance in his Church, that his Church may ascribe that glory to him which is due to him, who hath purchased these things for us at so dear a rate; so that this Ordinance is not so much to set forth the gift, as it is to set forth the price that purchased the gift for us; for if a man will give his own life, to save the life of his friend, this is a price of great value, worth the consideration; but Christ hath laid down his life, to redeem ours, while we were his enemies. And therefore for any to say, <HI>I have bread from heaven, by which I live, and am daily nourished by it; the outward Bread can but feed my outward man, I have drank of the Spirit of Life, which is the Cup of my Con∣solation, by which I shall thirst no more; this makes my heart glad more than a Cup of Wine, which will only refresh the outward man.</HI></P>
<P>To which I Reply; Dost thou glory in this excellent gift of Meat and Drink, which thy soul is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with, and not tremble at the consideration of the unvaluable Price

And therefore I advise thee to take heed, that whilst thou art so much glorying in the gift, thou come to forget thy obedience to the giver, in looking at his Ordinance of so little value, in comparison of the gift, which he bath purchased for thee, with his Body and Blood, as not to be worth thy while to attend his Ordinance, which is to put thee in mind of the Price which purchased the gift for thee.</P>
<P>What the Lords Supper is to shew forth, and how it is to be administred.</P>
<P>IT was the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> that delivered this Ordinance to the Gentile Church, he being called of God to be an Apostle of Jesus Christ to the <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and his call was some time after the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and after the giving of the holy Ghost in
<PB N="87" REF="001233_0088_0FB135ACC8900FF8"/>that plentiful manner to the twelve Apotles, who under that gift of the Spirit, were en∣d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with power from an high, to go forth under their second Commission, to preach the Gospel to all the world, accord∣ingly they did, to all nations under heaven. At this time, this Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> was a Per∣secutor of the Church in its flourishing state; for it was said before his Call, <HI>Acts</HI> 6.7. The Word of the Lord increased, and the number of the disciples multiplied in <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI> greatly; for after the Resurrection &amp; Ascention of our Lord, he sent the Comfor∣ter, even the Spirit of truth, to abide with them forever, according to the promise which he had made to them, the night in which was betrayed, <HI>John.</HI> 14.16. and I will pray the Father, and he shall give you an∣other Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, This Comforter is his divine Presence which did appear to them after his bodily presence was with-drawn from them. Now after these things, the Lord Jesus appeared to <HI>Paul,</HI> with his bodily pre∣sence, and of his free grace called him into the faith of himself, which was the last sight of him, before <HI>Paul</HI> wrote the 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.8. And this Apostle gives the <HI>Corinthians</HI> an account, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after these things, that he received of the Lord this Ordinance, which
<PB N="88" REF="001233_0089_0FB135ADD0BC8008"/>he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d delivered to them, <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.23. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <Q>For I have received of the Lord, that which also I delivered unto you, that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed, took Bread, and when he had given Thanks, break it, and said, Take, eat, this is my Body which is bro∣ken for you; this do in remembrance of me: After the same manner also, he took the Cup when he had supped, saying, This Cup is the New-Testament in my Blood; this do ye as often as ye drink it, in remembrance of me; for as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew the Lords Death till he come.</Q></P>
<P>From hence we may observe, that this Ordinance was delivered to the <HI>Gentile</HI> Churches, by the order of Jesus Christ, after he had plentifully manifested unto his Apostles, and their successors, his divine presence, by a clear manifestation of his God-head, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> their own souls; and the end of it was, to shew forth his death, which was the purchase of the holy Chest for us; for saith the Apostle to them, <HI>As often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye do shew the Lords Death till he come;</HI> for at this time, when this Ordinance was delivered to them, his bodily presence was withdrawn from his Church and People,
<PB N="89" REF="001233_0090_0FB135B17A65E7C8"/>but they were in the enjoyment of his di∣vine presence; for he did not leave his Church comfortless; for their Comforter was with them, and dwelt in them, and was the object of their Faith and Hope, tho' his bodily Presence was withdrawn from them, for a time; but he hath left this Ordinance with them, to keep in memory the unvaluable Price which he gave to pur∣chase this Comforter for them, which Com∣forter is the Fruit of the Tree of Life, which we come at by the death of the inno∣cent, who was cut down by the Cherubims and flaming Sword of Gods Justice, due to us for our fins, that we might escape the judgment of the second Death; and he hath left this Ordinance with his Church, to keep in memory his Death, which is our life; for his Body and Blood was the pur∣chase and Redemption of our Life, from the second death: so that we really eat his flesh, and drink his blood, seeing this spiritual meat and drink (which we live by) was purchased for us with his Body and Blood; and this Ordinance is to keep the purchase of it in our memory: for the pur∣chase is abscuted from us, tho' we enjoy that which is purchased; for the ordinance is to shew forth the death of him that is absented, till he come, who was the sacrifice for us,

It was a true report that the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> heard of <HI>Solomons</HI> glory, but when her eyes came to see the King in his glory, it did far excel the same of what she did hear of him in her own Country; it would rejoyce the hearts of condemned Traytors, only to hear a report that their King was minded to grant a pardon for them, but if it never came forth, their joy perisheth with them: This is the joy of the hypo∣crites hope: But when the Kings Hand and

Examine your selves whether ye be in the faith, prove your own selves, know you not your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates? for it is the living creating Word of God, that made all things in the beginning, that gives us strength against the wicked One, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 2, 14. I have written unto you Young men, be∣cause ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked One, This is that very Word which created all things, and after was made flesh, and is become a great high Priest unto his people, being called of God as was <HI>Aaron;</HI> And his people know in themselves the truth of the Scriptures Testimony of his being so; But they that are in a dead faith
<PB N="105" REF="001233_0106_0FB183F61B0AF558"/>only believe him to be so by the report of the Scriptures, but are not made partakers of the benefit of his Priestly Office, and therefore have no experimental knowledge of the Truth of the Scripture; for he is not their high Priest, tho' they hypocritically profess him to be so, not being partakers of the benefit of his Priestly Office. Now the reason of the difference of these two states is this, tho' the first tidings of the report that Jesus Christ is a High Priest, comes by the Scripture, and they both be∣lieve the report by one and the same faith at the first; yet they do not both take the same course, to be benefited in his Priestly Office, for the one doth endeavour to be benefited in his Priestly Office by Repentance and earnest Prayer and Supplication to God, for the pardon of all theis sins, hoping to obtain it, accordingly they do; for upon this Repentance and hope, God confirms to them the truth of the scriptures Report, in taking away the guilt of their sins from off their Consciences; for where remission of sin is, there remains no more guilt upon the Conscience; for God sends the Spirit of his Son into their inward parts, and sancti∣fies them and makes them inwardly clean and holy; and thus their historical faith is become a living faith; for now they are
<PB N="106" REF="001233_0107_0FB183F7634119C8"/>come to know the truth of the Scriptures report; so that now their faith is from an inward sight: But the other taketh another course; for they believing the scriptures report, concerning Christs Priestly Office, with a dead faith, or an historical faith, they come to obtain a dead hope of mercy and forgiveness of their sins; and upon this faith and hope, they imbody themselves into an outward Church fellowship, and partake of the Ordinances, and under this dead faith and dead hope, they offer to God abundance of dead Prayers, and all this is done in their sinful state: So that these never come to know the certainty of the truth of the Scriptures report, nor see the state of the other; and so much the exacter they walk according to the letter of the Scripture, (tho' they have no fellowship with the Spirit of God) so much greater is their delusion.</P>

Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a New Creature, old things are past away, behold all thing are become new. This wonderful change hath God wrought in every one that is interested in Christs Priestly Office; for they see this great work wrought in themselves, with their own eyes, for the old things which are now gone away, were the effect and

But all that are intrusted in Christs Priestly Office, see this great work of Mortification and Sanctification wrought in themselves, and can say in truth, that Jesus Christ is their Priest, not because the scripture said he is a Priest, for these are eye witnesses of the truth of it, being partakers of the benefit of it, accor∣ding to what is written, <HI>Gal.,</HI> 3.1. before

<P>And whereas the High Priest under the first Testament, did his Priestly Office in the temple of God, which temple was made with hands, which things were but sha∣dows of heavenly thing; but Jesus Christ is a high Priest of the real Temple of God not made with hands, being tipified by those high priests under the old Testament; so likwise the Saints Bodies, or Church of God, was tipified by that Temple built by <HI>Solomon;</HI> for that temple was but a figure of the true Temple of God, as ap∣peareth by these following scriptures, <HI>Acts</HI> 7.48.

<P><PB N="114" REF="001233_0115_0FB184054303F900"/>
The <HI>first</HI> thing, is, These have neither heard Gods Voice at any time, nor see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n his shape, so that such, Professors as these, are wholly alienated from any right know∣ledge of God; but all Gods Children have both heard his voice immediately with their own ears, and seen him with their own eyes, as appearesth in the following Chapter, <HI>Job.</HI> 6.45, 46. It is written in the Prophets, And they shall be all taught of God, every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the father, cometh to me; not that any man hath seen the father, save he which is of God, he hath seen the father. Thus it appeareth plainly, the reason why the one hath a living faith, and the other but a dead faith, because the one hath a faith in God only from the report of the scriptures, but are altogether alienated from any right knowledge or acquaintance with God; but the faith of the other, is from their hearing of Gods voice immedi∣ately, with their own ears, being taught by him, and in seeing of him with their own eyes; for their Bodies are his Temple, where they see his face, and here his Voice, for his word abideth in them, saith the scripture, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 2.14.</P>
<P>The <HI>second</HI> thing to be observed, is. That Christ exhort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> these litteral profes∣sors
<PB N="115" REF="001233_0116_0FB1840668281338"/>to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the scriptures, for [saith Christ] they are they which testifie of me, but ye will not come to me, that ye might have life? From these words of Christ we may observe the difference between these that are in a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead faith, and his church which are in a living faith; for saith Christ, ye will not come to me that ye might have life; so that it appears, these had not life, but were dead in sin, and therefore could not have a living faith, while in this state; for they were wholly alienated from any knowledge of the life of the Son of God; but the scripture testifieth, that he that hath the Son, hath life, and he that hath not the son of God, hath not life; for it is written, in him is life, and the life is the light of men; but these litteral Professors had not this life abiding in them, and therefore were in a state of darkness, but Gods church hath this life in them, and therefore they are the light of the world; for this life is the light of the world, and lighteth every one that cometh into the world, with the light of his law, and every one that be∣lieveth in him, with the light of his Gospel; for this life is very God <HI>manifested</HI> in his children; and the scripture testifieth, That they both see him and hear his voice,
<PB N="116" REF="001233_0117_0FB18408A740A138"/>1 <HI>John.</HI> 1.2.3. for the life was manifested and we have seen it, and bear witness, and shew unto you, that eternal life which was with the father, and was manifested unto us; that which we have seen, and heard, declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us, and truly our fellowship is with the father, and with his son Jesus Christ. Thus Gods Children declae, him whom they have seen with their own eyes, and heard his voice, with their own ears, according to Scripture te∣stimony; for saith Christ, They are they which testifie of me; and all those that are in a living faith, have received the scripture testimony, and have gone to Christ for life, by their directions, and have ob∣tained is, for the holy scripture is the voice of the spirit and bride, which testi∣fie of Christ.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Third</HI> thing to be observed, from Christ words, to these scriptural Professors who are in a dead faith, which faith they have attained unto, by the report of the Scripture, but never come to know the truth of the report; for saith Christ to them, Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have eternal life, and ye will not come to me, that ye might have life; thus they expected to obtain eternal life,
<PB N="117" REF="001233_0118_0FB1840A4BA76218"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which could not give it them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would not come unto Christ, where they might have had it; for the scriptures are they which testifie of him, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them we cannot have eternal life; for they are only our Counsellor, to give us directions which way we shall come to obtain it, and also they contain some signs or aligores, to guide the faith and judgment aright, of those that have already attained salvation by Christ; so that those figures are beneficial only to such, and to no other, being only outward signs of Spiritual be∣nefits, which those that have obtained e∣ternal life, are partakers of, to keep in their memory, by what means they come to partake of those spiritual benefits; for the holy scriptures are given us by the inspi∣ration of God, and are profitable to teach us, and to reprove us, and to instruct us, in the way of righteousness, but they can∣not give us life, that come<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Christ alone, for when by the scriptures counsel and directions, we are come to Christ he gives us life, by which life we are quickened who were before dead in our sins; and this life which he gives us, is the light of the world, and we are the lamps that contain it; while we retain and keep the life; for this life which we have received, was in
<PB N="118" REF="001233_0119_0FB1840C9C6B48A8"/>the beginning with God, and was God, ac∣cording to <HI>Johns</HI> Testimony, 1 <HI>Job.</HI> 1.1. That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes which we have looked upon, &amp; our hands have handled of the word of life; for the life was manifested, and we have seen it. Now when we, by the directions of the scripture, are come to Christ, and of him have received this word of life, it comes to be our teacher; for Christ, as be is a great Prophet, teacheth us immediately by this Word of Life, which he hath given us, and the scriptures bear witness to the truth of it, for saith Christ, The scriptures are they that testifie of me: And therefore let us view what they testifie concerning this immediate teaching, wherewith Jesus Christ teacheth his Church with; for the New-Testament is not a writing, which is written with Ink, in a book, but the scrip∣tures, is a writing written with Ink in a book; and they are they which testifie of the truth, of this spiritual writing, or im∣mediate teaching of God, which these lit∣teral of scriptural ministers never saw not understood any thing of it, being unlearned men in this lesson; for it is a peculiar thing sealed up among Christs Desciples, it being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> written with Christ own Spirit

That the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> tells these <HI>Corinthians,</HI> That they are the Epistle of Christ mini∣stred (saith he) by us, that is by <HI>Paul,</HI> and some others, who were Ministers of this spiritual Epistle, written by Christ with his own Spirit, not with ink, saith he. Now we know the Bible is written with ink, but this writing is with the spirit of the living God, and it is this Ministration that bring∣eth them into a living faith, because this Epistle is written on their hearts with the spirit of the living God, not upon Tables of stone, saith he; for that which was written upon two Tables of stone, was the Old-Testament or Covenant, and the Blood of that Testament or Covenant, was the blood of Beasts; but the Blood of the New-Testament or Covenant was the Blood of Jesus Christ, which was figured out by the Old-Testament, written on stone, and
<PB N="120" REF="001233_0121_0FB1840FAD05E4E8"/>dedicated with the blood of beasts, who also, saith he hath made us able Ministers of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> New-Testament, that is, of this Epistle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> written on their hearts with his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> This is the Epistle of their In∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which is to disciple them in his own doctrine, by his immediate teaching, as he is a great Prophet; and be made <HI>Paul</HI> with some others, able Ministers of the New-Testament, which was f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>zured out by letters written on Stone, called the Old-Testament or Covenant, which <HI>Paul</HI> here testifieth that they were not Ministers of the said letter; for that was the figurative <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and was abolished, as in the 13. <HI>v.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Testament writen on stone, and dedicated with the Blood of Beasts, was but a pattern, to figure out the substance, which was to be fulfilled by Christ; and this Epistle of Christs, held forth by the scriptures, never was known or read by any, but his disciples; for the false Church and false Teachers, are ministers only of that which is written with Ink in and Book, but understand nothing of the New-Testament, which the book beareth witness to; for they are ministers of the Letter or Old-Testament, written on two Table of stone, and dedicated with the blood of Beasts, but know nothing of the

And the end of the Apostle, in treating upon it, is to shew the abolishing of the Old Covenant written on stone, as appeareth in the last verse, in that he saith, a New Covenant he hath made, the first old, now that which decayeth and waxeth old, is ready to vanish away, saith the Apostle; now that which vanisheth away, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, this old Covenant, written on stone, and made with the house of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and dedicated with the blood of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Goats, was but a pattern of heavenly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and therefore God, by the Prophet, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from the figure, to the substance, for that testament was written on stone, and de∣dicated with the blood of beasts, being a figure of the remission of sins; so the New Covenant is written on the hearts of Gods Children, and dedicated with the Blood of Jesus Christ, in which Covenant there is really remission of sins; for God is mer∣ciful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities, he will remember no more.

Thus Jesus Christ teacheth his Children immediately by his spirit, tho' his bodily presence is gone away, yet he hath sent us an advocate or comforter to abide with us forever even the spirit of Truth; and this promise he made to his Disciples the night in which he was betrayed, <HI>Job.</HI> 14.16, 17. <HI>And I will pray the father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever, even the spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you.</HI> Thus it appeareth by the Testimony of the Scripture, that the world seeth not this Teacher, neither knoweth him, but God's Children do know him, for he dwelleth
<PB N="127" REF="001233_0128_0FB1841CEAADA8C0"/>with them, and in them, &amp; is their teacher, as appeareth also in <HI>John</HI> 13.16. <HI>How about when the Spirit of truth is come, he will guide you into all truth, for he shall not speak of him∣self, but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak,</HI> Thus it appeareth by the Testimony of the scripture, that this Spirit is the guide of Gods Children, and speaketh in them, and sheweth them what it heareth from the Father, and from the Son. Thus the Children of God, are immediately taught of God, and know what his Doctrine is, for they hear it with their own ears im∣mediately, from his own mouth; for he doth manifest himself unto them, but not unto the World, as appeareth in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 14.21, 22. Thus we have the Testimony of the Scriptures, that the Doctrine of Jesus Christ is his immediate teaching, by his Spirit, in his Children.

<P>But my purpose at this time is to treat only upon his Kingly Power, manifested in the hearts of his Children, in this world, that the ten Virgins, to whom I direct this my Epistle to, may examine themselves, whether they are ruled by his Kingly Power, or not; for there is nothing written con∣cerning him in the Scripture, but the truth of it is confirmed in us, immediately by his Spirit, if we order our conversation a∣right; for as there is virtue seen and felt, that proceeds from his Priestly Office, to purge and cleanse us really from sin, and from his Prophetical Office, to teach us immediately by his Spirit, so likewise there is seen and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a mighty Power from his Kingly Office, in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and this will appear evidently by scripture Testimony; for if we observe things only from the letter of the Scripture, without any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> or sensible feeling of vertue <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>wing from Christ, we are under a great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, being in a carnal dead state; for when the <HI>Gala∣tions</HI> turned back from the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Spi∣rit of Truth, to the works the Law, and so observed commands meekly from the Scripture, the Apostle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> being bewitched, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.1, 2. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>

<P><HI>EVery Man praying or prophecying, having his Head covered, dishonoureth his Head. But every Woman that prayeth or prophecieth, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the first place, let us examine into the Apostles writing, to see and understand what this Covering is, that he is treating upon; seeing that it is a decent covering for the woman to be covered with, in the presence of God and Man, but an undecent coverning for the man to make use of it, to cover his head with, in the presence of God and man.</P>

And <HI>Secondly,</HI> To examine into the mat∣ter, whether this be not something, which God hath placed in nature, both in the Male and in the Female, and whether the ignorance of the times, hath not taken up some vain custom in the room thereof; and therefore let us turn our eyes from the worlds Custom in the matter, and look upon what the Apostle saith, about it, and he will tell us plainly, before he leaveth the matter, what covering it is he intends, which is to be seen in the 13, 14 and 15 verses, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dge in your selves, is it comely that a woman pray unto God uncovered, doth not even nature it self teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him, but if a woman have long hair, it is a glory to her; for her hair is given her for a Covering. From hence we may plainly see, it is a covering placed (by God) in nature, and given only to the Woman to cover her head with, and nature teacheth the woman to make a covering of it, and to cover her head with it; for saith the Apostle, her hair is given her for a covering; but contrary wise, nature teacheth the man, not to make use of his hair, to cover his head with it, as the woman doth, because God hath not given it to him for a covering, is be hath to the woman; and therefore
<PB N="147" REF="001233_0148_0FB18444A73D2A80"/>nature it self teacheth the Man, not to wear his hair any longer than is for his comfort; for saith the Apostle in the seventh vers. <HI>A Man indeed ought not to cover his head, for as much as he is the image <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and glory of God; but the Woman is the glory of the Man.</HI> So that God hath given this covering to the Woman, in sign of her subjection to him, who is made in the Image of God.</P>
<P>Therefore for the man to make use of his hair for a covering, as the woman doth, dishonoureth himself, who is the head; for as much as he is in the Image and glory of God, but the Woman is made to be a glory to the Man, by her subjection to him; and her subjection to him, is her glory in the sight of God; for she was made for him, and not the Man for her; <HI>for this cause</HI> (saith the Apostle) in the 10. v. <HI>ought the Woman to have power on her head, because of the Angels:</HI> for as the Angels are made ministring Spirits before him, in whose image man was made, so is the woman an help, as before him, who is made to be her head &amp; she is to be a glory to him, by her sub∣jection, and hath power given her of God to cover her head with her hair, in token of it.</P>
<P>Thus it appeareth, by what the Apostle writeth to this Church, that the man pray∣ing to God, and prophecying to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, with
<PB N="148" REF="001233_0149_0FB18447A6D68140"/>his head being thus covered, dishonoureth his head; when as God hath not given him his hair to cover his head with, as the wo∣man doth, and ought to do. And therefore every woman praying or prophesying with her head uncovered, dishonoureth her head, (for saith the Apostle) her Hair is given her for a Covering.</P>
<P>Thus it appeareth, that it is the hair that the Apostle is treating upon, and that it is a shame for a man to wear long hair, and much more for a man to pray or prophecy with it on his head in the presence of God and his Church, when as it is not given him for a covering, as it is to the Woman, so that it ought not to be on the mans head, as any time, but ought to be on the Womans head at all times, and the Apostle telleth them, saying, <HI>We have no such custom, nei∣ther the Churches of God,</HI> that is, to wear long hair, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s appeareth in the 14, 15, 16. <HI>verses</HI> Doth not even nature it self teach you, that if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him; but if a woman have long hair, it is a Glory to her; for her hair is given her for a covering?

<P>VVHat I have written in the following Treatise, hath been from no other president but the holy Scriptures themselves, without regard to any other law or custom whatsoever.</P>
<P>Marriage was an Ordinance of God from the beginning, and is to continue to the worlds end; being no ways altered by the Gospel, and that precept written by <HI>Moses,</HI> which gave liberty of Divorce, was written only because of the hardness of their hearts,
<PB N="150" REF="001233_0151_0FB1844B8F2DAA78"/>to whom he wrote it, and is made void by our Saviour; for a Marriage made by God, ought not to be seperated by Man, upon any account whatsoever; and therefore our Saviour allows a Divorce, only upon a de∣fraudulent Marriage; for such a Marriage is not of God; for Christ allows of no Di∣vorce, but only upon Fornication, which is an act done before Marriage, by which the man is beguiled, and therefore hath liberty (if he sees cause) to give her a bill of Divorce, because he found her not a Maid or chaste Woman, and therefore was defrauded and beguiled by her. And Christ makes a clear distinction between Fornica∣tion and Adultery; for a thing must be known by the name of it, otherwise how shall we distinguish one thing from another? and therefore our Saviour makes a full and clear distinction between Fornication and Adultery, as is to be seen, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.31. <HI>But I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, saving for the cause of Fornication, causeth her to commit Adultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced, committeth Adultery.</HI> From hence we may observe, he doth not say, whosoever putteth away his Wife, saving for the case of Adultery, but Fornication; <HI>secondly,</HI> he doth not say, He that puts away his Wife, causeth her
<PB N="151" REF="001233_0152_0FB1844CE9C0EF30"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> commit Fornication, but Adultery: And, <HI>thirdly</HI> he doth not say, he that marrieth her that is divorced, committeth Fornication, but committeth Adultery: so that Christ makes a very clear and plain distinction between fornication and Adulte∣ry. And again, he saith a second time, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.9. <HI>And I say unto you, whosoever shall put away his Wife, except it be for Forni∣cation, and shall marry another, committeth Adultery; and whosoever marrieth her that is put away, doth commit Adultery.</HI> He doth not say, whosoever putteth away his Wife, except it be for Adultery, but for Fornica∣tion. And, <HI>secondly,</HI> he doth not say, He that putteth away his Wife and marrieth another, committeth Fornication, but Adultery: And, <HI>thirdly,</HI> he doth not say, Whosoever marrieth her that is put away commiteth Fornication, but doth commit Adultery. So that Christ makes a clear distinction in both places, between Adul∣tery and Fornication; for Fornication is an act done in a single state, and therefore cannot be called Adultery, tho' it be an act of whoredom. When the Scripture com∣prehends both these acts, it saith, <HI>Whore∣mongers and Adulterers God will judg, Heb.</HI> 15 for Adultery is to distinguish the act alter Marriage, from the act done before Marriage,
<PB N="152" REF="001233_0153_0FB1844F0D201798"/>as in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.31, 32. <HI>And hast not been as an Harlot, in that thou scornest hir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, but as a Wife that committeth Adultery, which taketh strangers instead of her husband.</HI> And both <HI>Make</HI> and <HI>Luke,</HI> which have made Record of our Saviours Testimony against a Di∣vorce, both witness that our Lord testified against a Divorce upon any account after a lawful Marriage, <HI>Mark</HI> 10.11.12. <HI>Who∣soever shall put away his Wife, and marry ar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther, committeth Adultery against her; and of a Woman shall put away her husband, and be married to another, she committeth Adultery.</HI> Here we may observe is no allowance at all for a divorce; for he speaks concerning the state of two which God hath joyned to∣gether, as in the <HI>9th v. What therefore God hath joyned together, let no man put asunder.</HI></P>
<P>By the law of <HI>Moses</HI> it was death, with∣out mercy, for a Damsel to beguil a man, by marrying with him, after she had com∣mitted Fornication, <HI>Deut.</HI> 22.13, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> compared with the 20.21. <HI>v.</HI> But our Lord hath placed the liberty of a divorce, in the room of that severe Precept, but after God hath joyned two in a Marriage Covenant, there is nothing to be acted by man in way of separation; for she remains a mans Wife, tho' an Adulteress, and her Husband cannot discharge her from that
<PB N="153" REF="001233_0154_0FB18450E4AE0B90"/>sin, by giving her a bill of divorce; for in so doing he becomes guilty by our Sa∣vious testimony, and causeth her to pro∣ceed in that sin; for she ought either to be reconciled to her Husband, or remain unmarried, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.10, 11. For she is not free from her Husband, neither can he free her, neither can she be freed from him by man, but by God only, who joyned them in one; for, saith Christ, <HI>what there∣fore God hath joyned together, let no man put asunder, Mar.</HI> 10.9. So that a Divorce may be granted by the husband, when God hath not joyned them together; for if he find her guilty of Fornication, when he hath taken her, then he is at his liberty, whether he will accept of her; but if he accepts of her, as not being a Virgin or a chaste woman, she becomes his lawful Wife, he may not put her away all his days. And by the law of <HI>Moses,</HI> if a Man lay with a Virgin, he was to endue her to be his Wife, except her Father refused to give her, and was not tolerated to put her away all his days, <HI>Deut.</HI> 22.28, 29 <HI>Exod.</HI> 22.16, 17. And for any besides the husband to give a bill of Divorce, is a contemptuous act, both against Gods Law and Gospel, <HI>Deut.</HI> 24.1.3. <HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> 19.9. In the beginning God made but one man, and called his name <HI>Adam,</HI> and out of
<PB N="154" REF="001233_0155_0FB18452757E2720"/>him he made a Manness or Woman, and brought her to <HI>Adam,</HI> that there might be a re-union, unseperable, for that end to multiply and increase, and replinish the earth in that lawful union of Marriage, by the appointment of God, and sometimes by plurality of Wives, as appears in <HI>Abra∣ham,</HI> who designed no other Wife than <HI>Sarah,</HI> yet afterward married his maid.

<P>Yet, notwithstanding that, Poligamy was allowed of God, and no where forbid∣den by any Law of God, but Laws prescrib∣ed by <HI>Moses</HI> to suit such a state, as in <HI>Deut.</HI> 21.15, &amp;c. <HI>Exod.</HI> 21.10. And many of the holy Prophets and servants of the Lord had plurality of Wives, yet it is no ways con∣venient among <HI>Christians,</HI> as appeareth by Scripture Testimony; for <HI>Moses</HI> left directi∣ons behind him concerning such Kings as were to rule Gods Church, under the Law, not to multiply Wives to themselves, <HI>Deut.</HI> 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 17 And <HI>Solomon</HI> not following his directi∣ons, it proved a snare to him, 1 <HI>King</HI> 11.4.
<PB N="155" REF="001233_0156_0FB18453A8B41310"/>And likewise the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> under the Gospel, left directions behind him, that Bishops and Deacons (who where to be Lea∣ders and Rulers in Gods Church) were to be the Husbands of one Wife, 1 <HI>Tim</HI> 3.2.12. And that which may prove a snare to the leaders of Gods People, may be the like to any particular member in the Church; for saith the Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 6.12. <HI>All things are lawful for me, but all things are not expedi∣ent for me;</HI> that is to say, as to his Christian state; for a Christian is not to entangle himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a Souldier; and therefore ought to keep himself as free as possible he can from all shares and cumbrances of this World, that he may attend upon the Lord without distraction; and therefore the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> commends a single life to be most free from carefulness, where God gives the gift of Continency; but where he doth not, it is better to marry then to burn; for Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled, and is a remedy against Fornication.</P>
<P>The taking away my lawful covenanted Wife, and other mens Wives in this Colony of <HI>Connecticut</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> contrary to the rule of Gods word, is the reason of my pub∣lishing this Treatise: of Marriage &amp; Divorce.</P>

<PB N="160" REF="001233_0161_0FB1845CC6710858"/>committed fornication, and is defiled, this Marriage is not of God; for he is not the Author of deceit; and therefore it is in the power of her husband to give her a bill of Divorce, except he take her after he hath the knowledge of her defilement; if so, then he may not put her a way all his days; so that nothing is excepted by which a man may put away his Wife, save fornication only; and this doctrine Christ taught to his Disciples in his Sermon upon the mount, limitting a Divorce only upon this one thing; <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.31, 32. It hath been said; whosoever shall put away his wife, let him give her a writing of Divorcement, but I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his wife, saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit Adultery, and he that marrieth her that is Divorced, com∣miteth Adultery. Here Christ Condemns all manner of seperation, where the Mar∣riage is of God, and plainly testifieth, that be that putteth away his wife, causeth her to commit Adultery; and he that marrieth her, committeth Adultery also.</P>
<P>The Lord in his doctrine to his disciples, thus makes void that liberty of Divorce, that <HI>Moses</HI> gave under the covenant of the law to <HI>Israel;</HI> after this the Pharisees came also to him, tempting him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.3. &amp;c.
<PB N="161" REF="001233_0162_0FB1845F6505EBA8"/>and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> His answer to them was, Have ye not read, that he which made them at the beginning, made them Male and Female, and said, for this cause shall a man leave Father and Mo∣ther, and cleave to his Wife, and they twain shall be one flesh; therefore they are no more twain, but one flesh; what therefore God hath joyned together, let no man put asunder: Which doctrine they could not deny, upon which they query the reason, Why then <HI>Moses</HI> commanded them to give a writing of Divorcement, and to put her away? <HI>Moses</HI> (saith he) because of the hardness of your hearts, suffered you to put away your wives; but from the be∣ginning it was not so. Thus he stops their Mouths, and confirms the truth of his doctrine, before taught to his disciples; and further saith unto them, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, and shall marry another, com∣mitteth Adultery; and whosoever shall marry her that is put away, committeth Adultery; so that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> plainly appeareth, that <HI>Moses</HI> end in giving them that precept, was of two evils to prevent the greater; for the husband through his hard heart, <HI>Deut.</HI> 24.3. hating her, lived in the sin of

And the Apostle confirms the truth of this Doctrine of Christ, against the act of cutting off, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.10, 11. And unto the married, I command, yet not I, but the Lord, let not the Wife depart from her husband; but and if she depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband; and let not the husband put away his Wife. Here it plainly appeareth, that the Woman is bound by the law to her hus∣band, so long as he fiveth, as in <HI>v.</HI> 39 so that if she depart from her husband, God requireth her either to remain unmarried, or else to be reconciled to her husband, and (saith he) let not the husband put away his Wife; so that she is limitted to one of these two things, let her departure be upon what account soever; for saith the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> 7 3. So then if while her husband l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>veth, she be married to another man, she shall be called an Adulteress; for the husband is the head of the Wife, even as Christ is the head of the Church, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5 23. So that the Wife is bound to be in subjection to her own

But the state of the Man stands otherwise, than the state of the Woman doth; for she can be given but to one man, she can have but one head, and serve but one Master in that state.</P>
<P>But <HI>David</HI> (who was beloved of the Lord, yea, a man after Gods own heart, save in the matter of <HI>Ʋriah</HI>) had many lawful Wives, and the Lord gave more into his bosom if he had seen cause to have taken them, as it to be seen 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 12.8. yet it would have been unlawful for <HI>David</HI> to have put away any one of them; for every one of them were bound by the law of God to him, as long as he lived; and tho' his wife <HI>Micha,</HI> (through her Fathers means) had lived a long time in the act of Adultery
<PB N="165" REF="001233_0166_0FB1846D2EA46A18"/>yet after he was come to the Kingdom, he sent and demanded his Wife, and took her again, he gave her no bill of Divorce, for that would have been unlawful; and when ten of his Concubine Wives were de∣filed by his Son <HI>Absalom,</HI> he gave them no bills of Divorce, for that would have been unlawful, for if they had been married to other men, by liberty from him, hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> king∣dom would have been defiled by Adultery, Bills of Divorce would have made way for them to have lived in the Act of Adultery, and therefore he shut them up in Widow∣hood, untill the day of their death: So that it appears, when God joyns more wo∣men to a man than one, the Marriage is lawful, being made by God, but the Wo∣man can be subject but to one Man, she can have but one head to rule over her; so tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it appears, the state of man, and the state of the woman is quite differing; for the man is made in the image and glory of God, and therefore is the head of the Wife, as Christ is the head of the Church, but the woman is the image and glory of the Man, and therefore the man is the Womans head, and is to rule over her, as God or Christ is the Mans head, and is to rule over him; so that there can be no bill of Divorce against the man, to take away his wife upon any
<PB N="166" REF="001233_0167_0FB1846EA8A2CD30"/>account, without high contempt against God; for God is the giver, and the man is the receiver, and therefore hath the domi∣nion over the woman, as Christ hath over the Church, so that if a Man may be set free from subjection to the only true God, (who is his only true head,) and be subject to, and serve another God, without being guilty of Idolatry, then may a woman be freed from her first husband, who is her only true head (by God's decree) and became another Mans Wife lawfully, without being guilty of Adultery, but not else; for God hath made the one parallel with the other.</P>
<P>In Scripture, a mans Wife is reckoned up with his other earthly treasure, as appears <HI>Exo.</HI> 20▪17. <HI>Thou shalt not covet thy Neigh∣bours House, thou shalt not covet they Neighbours Wife, nor his Man servant, nor his Maid ser∣vant, nor his Ox, nor his Ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbours.</HI> As also when <HI>Moses</HI> left directions about the election of a King, he shews the several snares and temptations that a King might be ensnared with, tho' lawful things in themselves, and reckoneth Wives in with other earthly treasures, <HI>Deut.</HI> 17▪16, 17 <HI>But he shall not multiply Hor∣ses to himselt,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Neither shall be multiply <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, that his heart turn not away; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall be greatly Multiply to himself

Thus we may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e lawful things in themselves may not be expedient, for we see also, that <HI>Paul</HI> appoin∣ted both <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> (who were to ordain Elders) to chuse out such for Bishops and Deacons as were the Husbands of one Wife; for the care of the Churches lay upon them, and therefore they had need to be free from the cares and cumbrances of more Wives than one.</P>
<P>And thus the Scripture shews, how the state of the Man, and the state of the Wo∣man differ, so that both in the books of the Old Testament and New, there was given no liberty for Judges to grant bills of Divorce, to cut off a mans wise from him, neither doth it stand with human reason, but is a meer wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Divil,

<P>And whereas the name Concubine, is in this our day applied to Harlots, it is an evil thing; for by Scripture account a Concu∣bine is as lawful a Wife as a Wife that is a Queen, tho' not so honourable; for the word Concubine is to distinguish from a more honourable Wife, as when <HI>Jacob</HI> took <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Wife, his Wives hand-maids to be his Wives, those were called his Concubines, and yet were his lawful Wives, as appears by the Testimony of the holy ghost in the scripture, <HI>Gen.</HI> 37▪<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Joseph</HI> being seventeen years old was feeding the flock, with his Brethren, and the lad was with the sons of <HI>Bilhah,</HI> and with the sons of <HI>Zilpah,</HI> his Fathers Wives.

<P>And in this state of Marriage, as the Husband represents Christ, ought to walk in his place as a Man of Wisdom, and love his Wife, even as Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for it, even so ought the Man to love his Wife as himself, and not to be bitter against her, but tender hearted, giving honour to her, as unto the weaker vessel.

<P>VVHereas there is a printed Law in her Majestys Colony of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> Entituled only <HI>Hereticks,</HI> in the preface to it, they say, <HI>To prevent the danger persons are in, of being poysoned in their judgments and principles by Heriticks</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Which said Law, the Queen by advice of her Council hath condemned, repealed, and declared it void and of none effect, it being contrary to their Charter. And in∣deed there is a good hand of God in the Queens Act, for I know of no sect worse poysoned in their Judgments and Principles by gross heresie, than the Church of <HI>New-England;</HI> and it is very evident that Here∣ticks have ever persecuted the true Church under abusive Titles, as <HI>Deceivers, Hereticks, Quakers,</HI> and the like abusive Titles, which they themselves are guilty of; for Erroni∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us Persons, Principles &amp; Practices are con∣demned by the Scriptures of Truth; so that they have no other way to cloak themselves under their Delusion and Heresy, but by casting such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> titles on the Children
<PB N="177" REF="001233_0178_0FB1848DCDACF230"/>of God, and so persecute them, and burn their Books; for Satans design in making use of these deluded persons, thus to act, is to suppress the Truth, under pretence of Heresy; as for instance, I shall begin with the Master of the house, whom they <HI>call'd Bel∣z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bub,</HI> the Prince of Devils, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.24. he went by the name of Deceiver, <HI>Mat.</HI> 27▪36. <HI>Paul</HI> by the name of Heretick, <HI>Acts</HI> 24.14. <HI>Luthers</HI> Books were burnt under pretence utterly to suppress Heresy; the worthy Martyrs in Queen <HI>Mary's</HI> time, suffered death under the Name of Hereticks; and those worthy Martyrs in <HI>Boston</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> under the name of <HI>Quakers</HI> and <HI>Hereticks;</HI> and my Books by this Law now repealed, have been condemned and burnt, under pretence of Heresy, tho' I have made fair proffers at their general Court to re∣ward any person well for their time and pains, that would endeavour to shew me any one errour in them, but none have yet publickly appeared.</P>
