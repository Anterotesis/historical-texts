<P>THEN! T'was <HI>after</HI> He had been taken up into the <HI>Heavenly World!</HI> He was a true Minister of the Gospel who uttered that Wish <HI>I wish; that if I Dy in the Pulpit, I may Dy Preaching of <HI>Repen∣tance;</HI> and that if I Dy out of the pul∣pit, I may Dy practising of it.</HI> I would most heartily come into the Wish.

<P>O the admirable <HI>Discord,</HI> the melo∣dious <HI>Discord,</HI> which must carry on the <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Christianity.</HI> A Conversation with a Glorious CHRIST in <HI>Heaven;</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="001462_0004_0FB34A4AECF94288"/>
must carry us up to <HI>Heaven.</HI> The Life of a Christian is then upon its true Notes, when he is as full of CHRIST and HEAVEN, as is in this Life attainable. <HI>Heavenly</HI> Contempla∣tions on the Blessed JESUS, <HI>Heavenly</HI> Consecrations to the Blessed JESUS, Lovely <HI>Imitations</HI> of <HI>Heaven</HI> and of JE∣SUS, O <HI>Heaven-born Souls,</HI> why do you make no greater Improvements in them! And yet I shall do my Can∣didate of the <HI>Heavenly Life,</HI> no manner of wrong, if I fetch him down from the Suburbs of <HI>Heaven,</HI> and lay him Groaning and Weeping in the lower parts of the <HI>Earth.</HI> No, There is a most incomparable Agreement, be∣tween a Conversation with CHRIST, and HEAVEN, and a Conversation that has a continual strain of <HI>Repen∣tance</HI> abasing of it; They assist each other wonderfully! You shall give me leave, without a Censure of <HI>Levity</HI> in the expression, to say; <HI>The shortest way to Heaven is by Water.</HI> The Ex∣pression was of old used in the Church of God. And you are apprised of what it means; It means, the <HI>Tears</HI> of
<PB N="3" REF="001462_0005_0FB34A4C283D29A8"/>
a <HI>Repenting Soul,</HI> which must keep run∣ning from our Eyes, till Death has closed them.</P>
<P>I will then this day put on the <HI>Cha∣racter,</HI> Oh! For the <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> of a <HI>John Baptist,</HI> among you! A <HI>Preacher of Repentance. <HI>Repentance, Repentance,</HI></HI> yea, a <HI>Life of Re∣pentance,</HI> is that Grand Article of Piety, whereof I propose the Inculca∣tion. But unto whom? Unto the <HI>Sinners</HI> that are yet perishing in their <HI>Unregeneracy,</HI> and <HI>Impenitency!</HI> Ah, poor Creatures; Tis very sure, You must <HI>Repent,</HI> or else you <HI>Perish,</HI> you Perish miserably. But my Errand is unto those, who have already <HI>Repented</HI> a thousand times over; Tis unto those who are daily mounting up to∣wards <HI>Heaven,</HI> with the <HI>Wings of Eagles,</HI> in the most Heavenly Flights of <HI>Manly Christianity.</HI> Tis unto them that are apace Ripening for <HI>Heaven,</HI> and just ready to step into it. Sirs, Of you the Demand is, That you keep <HI>Repent∣ing to the Last,</HI> and Lead a <HI>Life of Repentance</HI> as long as you Live.</P>
<P>If any one might have pretended an
<PB N="4" REF="001462_0006_0FB34A4D9E617740"/>
Excuse from the Exercise of <HI>Repentance,</HI> one might have thought, it would have been the Propher <HI>Isaiah,</HI> when he was favoured with the a Vision of our Holy Lord, and a Rapture into the Heavenly World. What? A man fly∣ing and shining among the <HI>Angels</HI> of God, and yet <HI>Repenting in Dust and Ashes</HI> before the Lord, and Lamenting his own Impurities! Oh, <HI>Wonderful! Wonderful!</HI> I dispute not, whether the Man of God were now in the <HI>Temple</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> or whether he were not rather, (which, with <HI>Peganius,</HI> I incline to think, he was) taken up to a View of its <HI>Original Pattern,</HI> that stupendous TEMPLE of God, which there is in the <HI>Heavenly World.</HI> But, beholding the Majesty of the Lord, the <HI>Spirit of Repentance</HI> immediately &amp; marvellously falls upon him. O thou Man of God. Why dost thou not now fall into Songs of Triumph, and make thy Boast unto the bright <HI>Angels</HI> before thine Eyes; <Q>Ye <HI>Seraphims,</HI> I am come in for a Room among you. Admit a <HI>Favourite of Heaven</HI> to take a place among you▪</Q> No, No The <HI>Eyes</HI> which thus have the

<HI>Monarch,</HI> &amp; the <HI>Glory</HI> of Heaven, daz∣zling of them, have the <HI>Tears of Re∣pentance</HI> presently filling of them. He Cries out, <HI>Wo is me, I am a man of Un∣clean Lips,</HI> The Vulgar Latin renders it,<HI>I have held my Peace.</HI> The meaning may be, <HI>Non Libere satis reprehendi Re∣gis ali<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>umque peccata.</HI> Q. D <Q>Alas, A∣las, I have not so faithfully discharged my Ministry, and <HI>spoken up</HI> for God and for Truth, as I should have done. <HI>Lord,</HI> I am so Vile a Sinner, I am un∣worthy to have my <HI>Lips</HI> ever Em∣ploy'd in any Message, or Service for thee.</Q> He could not be at <HI>Rest,</HI> until one of the <HI>Seraphims,</HI> under the Symbol of, <HI>Touching his Lips,</HI> with a <HI>Red Hot Stone</HI> taken from amidst the Pire on the <HI>Altar,</HI> assured him, <HI>That God had Pardoned him.</HI> The Right Stroke of <HI>Re∣pentance!</HI> Never to be at <HI>Rest,</HI> without Assurance of a <HI>Pardon. These things spake Esaias, when he saw the Glory of our Saviour.</HI></P>
<P>Oh! Could I with <HI>Lips thus touch'd,</HI> bring you the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> which I intend you. Tis,</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001462_0008_0FB34A5220076EB0"/><HI>That a Servant of God should fall into the Exercise of Re∣pentance, on every occasion afforded for it.</HI></P>
<P>The very Life of a Christian must be a <HI>Life of Repentance.</HI> It is not enough, that a man <HI>Repent once</HI> in his Life, The Dispositions of <HI>Repentance</HI> must <HI>Always</HI> be <HI>kept Alive,</HI> in a man, as long as he <HI>Lives.</HI> A Good man must over and over again <HI>Repent</HI> of his <HI>Evil-doing,</HI> and <HI>hold on Repenting</HI> all his Days. Thus the Great <HI>Austin</HI> caused the <HI>Pe∣nitential Psalms</HI> to be writ∣ten in GreatLetters, within the Curtains of his Death∣bed;<NOTE PLACE="marg">[The Psalms are, the VI, the XXV, the XXXII, the XXXVIII the LI, the CXXX the CXLIII.]</NOTE> that he might even give up the Ghost, in the midst of <HI>Penitential Ejacu∣lations.</HI> Truly, the Best of Men, have no cause to Leave off <HI>Repentance.</HI> Yea, the Better any man is, and the nearer to Heaven, the more will the <HI>Spirit of Repentance</HI> actuate him. The <HI>Motto</HI> of a Christian, methinks, it should be that of the An∣cient,
<PB N="7" REF="001462_0009_0FB34A5520A15908"/>
<HI>Nulli rei natus, nisi Pe∣nitentiae; <HI>Born to be in the Repenting Strain continually;</HI></HI> Never, Never to be out of it!</P>
<P>The First Thing to be now done, is, to Enquire,</P>
<P><HI>What is that <HI>Repentance,</HI> which we are to keep in continual Exercise?</HI></P>
<P>I will briefly state the Operations of that <HI>Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>First; In <HI>Repentance,</HI> tis to be supposed, we are Apprehensive, <HI>That we have Sinned;</HI> That we have been or done, that which is to be <HI>Repented</HI> of. An Apprehension of our <HI>Sinfulness</HI> is necessary. A <HI>Repenting</HI> Sinner, is a <HI>Convinced</HI> Sinner. The Language of <HI>Repentance,</HI> is that; 2 Sam. 24.10. <HI>I have Sinned greatly in that I have done, I have done very Foolishly.</HI> Tis implied, That we are acquainted with the <HI>Law</HI> of our GOD; That we have an Acquain∣tance with what the <HI>Exceeding Broad Law</HI> Enjoyns upon us. We must see the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD <HI>Violated,</HI> in what we have been, or done; A <HI>Law</HI> to be <HI>for ever Magnified and made Honourable.</HI> The First Thing said by a <HI>Repenting</HI> Sinner,
<PB N="8" REF="001462_0010_0FB34A57666F4B60"/>
is that, Luk. 15.17. <HI>I have Sinned against Heaven.</HI> But if we would not sinfully <HI>Intermit</HI> our due <HI>Repentance,</HI> we must see our selves thus Chargeable with <HI>Sin,</HI> in <HI>all</HI> that we do; <HI>Sinful</HI> in all <HI>Under∣takings;</HI> in all <HI>Conditions;</HI> in all <HI>Relati∣ons;</HI> Defiled with <HI>Sin,</HI> in all that we meddle withal. In this our <HI>Sight</HI> of our <HI>Sin,</HI> tis not only our <HI>Actual Sin,</HI> that is to be set before our Eyes. Our Sight must penetrate as far as our <HI>O∣riginal Sin.</HI> This must be seen, as the <HI>Original</HI> of all our Sin. We must Look <HI>in,</HI> Look <HI>down,</HI> upon that <HI>Foun∣tain of Wickedness,</HI> which we have in an <HI>Heart,</HI> that is <HI>Deceitful above all things, and desperately Wicked. 'O wretched One, that I am! What a Leper am I! What a Viper am I! What a Seed of all Sin have I Lodging in me!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; Tis necessary to <HI>Repen∣tance,</HI> that we <HI>Know</HI> and <HI>Think,</HI> what we have <HI>done,</HI> when we have <HI>Sinn'd.</HI> The Voice of <HI>Repentance</HI> is that; Job 33.27. <HI>I have Sinned, and Perverted that which is Right, and it Profited me not.</HI> To <HI>make Light of Sin,</HI> this is inconsistent with <HI>Re∣pentance.</HI> We don't <HI>Repent,</HI> until we
<PB N="9" REF="001462_0011_0FB34A58E5384648"/>
reckon <HI>Sin,</HI> the worst Evil in the world.</P>
<P>Because I would Chastise the most frequent and most fatal <HI>Folly</HI> in the world, I will somewhat Expressively tell you, what a man <HI>does,</HI> when he <HI>Sins.</HI> My Hearers, Attend unto me!</P>
<P><HI>A Sinner</HI> does Deny, Disown, cast off the <HI>Authority</HI> of the God that made him. He sets up <HI>Himself</HI> in the Throne of his Maker. He Reproaches the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Justice</HI> of GOD, in His <HI>Laws;</HI> the <HI>Wise</HI> and <HI>Just</HI> Rules that GOD has given us. He Questions the <HI>Goodness</HI> of GOD, and counts it better to be under his <HI>own Government,</HI> than that a <HI>Good</HI> GOD, should Govern him. He throws Contempt on the <HI>Holiness</HI> of GOD, and represents Him as an <HI>Unholy</HI> Approver of Sin. He defies the <HI>Power</HI> of GOD; &amp; Challenges all the Thun∣derbolts of the All-powerful One. He despises the <HI>Promises</HI> of GOD; He despises the <HI>Threatenings</HI> of GOD; He believes not His <HI>Faithfulness</HI> in them. He makes a <HI>Vile Use</HI> of the <HI>Benefits,</HI> he has received from GOD; a Vile Use of the <HI>Corrections</HI> which GOD has Em∣ploy'd upon him; a Vile Use of the
<PB N="10" REF="001462_0012_0FB34A5A6DD55278"/>
<HI>Punishments</HI> which he hath seen GOD inflict upon other Offendors. He tramples on the <HI>Blood</HI> of the Blessed JE∣SUS, which hath been shed, that men might be <HI>Redeemed from all Iniquity.</HI> He turns a Deaf Ear upon the motions of the Holy SPIRIT, who Cries unto him, O <HI>Do not this abominable thing!</HI> The Dictates and Warnings of his own <HI>Con∣science,</HI> the Deputy of GOD, are nothing with him. The Excellent <HI>Pattern</HI> of a CHRIST, and of the <HI>Saints,</HI> the <HI>Excellent in the Earth,</HI> who have been the <HI>Follow∣ers of that Good One,</HI> is derided by him. He disturbs the sweet <HI>Harmony</HI> whereto the world is tuned, by a Great Creator and Preserver. He Obeys the <HI>Devil,</HI> he Follows the <HI>Devil;</HI> and makes him∣self worse than the <HI>Beasts that Perish.</HI> He wrongs the <HI>Faculties</HI> of his own <HI>Soul;</HI> and Exposes himself to <HI>Wounds</HI> from the Wrath of GOD upon <HI>All his Interests.</HI> He prefers his <HI>Flesh</HI> above his <HI>Immortal Spirit.</HI> He prefers <HI>Temporal</HI> Enjoy∣ments on Earth, before <HI>Eternal</HI> Enjoy∣ments in Heaven. He incurs the un∣known, but fearful <HI>Miseries</HI> in the <HI>World to come;</HI> and all but for a momentany Delight in this World.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="001462_0013_0FB34A5BE57A6FC8"/>O Fearful! What? All of this <HI>Venom</HI> in every <HI>Sin!</HI> Such an Horror of <HI>Sin;</HI> Such an horrid and hideous <HI>Idaea</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> we ought always to be possessed of.</P>
<P>Thirdly; An <HI>Abhorrence</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> and of <HI>Our selves</HI> for <HI>our Sin;</HI> This must be an Ingredient of the <HI>Repentance</HI> to be always in motion with us.</P>
<P>We must be greatly <HI>Griev'd,</HI> because we have <HI>Sinned;</HI> Our <HI>Grief</HI> on the ac∣count of our <HI>Sin,</HI> must be incompara∣ble. <HI>Repentance</HI> is a <HI>Mourning</HI> for Sin. <HI>Sorrow</HI> for Sin does <HI>Pierce</HI> the Heart, and <HI>Break</HI> the Heart, in <HI>Re∣pentance.</HI> The <HI>Repenting</HI> Soul Cries out, <HI>I am sorry for my Sin!</HI> His Picture, I'll show it you; Tis in Jer. 31.18. <HI>I have surely heard him be moaning him∣self,— I am ashamed, yea, even confounded, beause I bear the Reproach of my Youth.</HI> His Dwelling is at <HI>Bochim.</HI> He looks on his Falls, with such Eyes as <HI>Peter</HI> had; with <HI>Weeping Eyes.</HI> He <HI>Weeps Bitterly.</HI> He is Greatly <HI>Troubled;</HI> He never counts, he can be <HI>Troubled</HI> enough. He <HI>Mourns,</HI> because he <HI>Mourns no more.</HI> And <HI>Sin</HI> being Loathsome to him,
<PB N="12" REF="001462_0014_0FB34AE72C9252F8"/>
he <HI>Loathes himself</HI> because of it. He Cries out with him; Job 42.6. <HI>I Ab∣hor myself, and Repent.</HI> He Loads him∣self with <HI>Shame.</HI> He is <HI>Asham'd</HI> of what he is and does. He looks upon <HI>Sin</HI> as a <HI>Shameful Folly.</HI> He calls himself, <HI>A Fool;</HI> and he is heartily willing, that the rest of the world should call him so. Hence, a <HI>Penitent Confessi∣on</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> will proceed from him. He does with Sincerity and Ingenuity. <HI>Confess</HI> his Foolishness. He comes to that; Psal. 32.5. <HI>I Acknowledge my Sin unto thee, and my Iniquity I have not hid; I said, I will Confess my Transgressions unto the Lord.</HI> He will <HI>Confess</HI> unto GOD; and he is very ready to <HI>Confess</HI> unto <HI>Man</HI> also, if he be call'd unto it. Finally; He <HI>Judges</HI> himself; he <HI>Humbles</HI> him∣self. He submits to all the <HI>Humiliation</HI> that God shall order for him. He is a <HI>Self-Condemned</HI> Sinner. He joyns with the <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Righteousness</HI> of GOD against himself; and he Cries out, <HI>Lord, I am worthy of all thy Judgments!</HI> If God visit him with <HI>Plagues,</HI> he owns he has deserved all these <HI>Plagues;</HI> and he says, <HI>I will bear the Indignation of the Lord, be∣cause
<PB N="13" REF="001462_0015_0FB34AE8E7B48530"/>
I have Sinned against Him.</HI> Yea, and if <HI>Men</HI> treat him Contemptuously, he is <HI>Patient</HI> under the Contempt; he bears the Contempt with <HI>Patience;</HI> he sees himself so Sinful, that he says, <HI>Con∣tempt belongs to me!</HI> Calcate me! —<HI>I am Unsavoury Salt; O Trample on me.</HI></P>
<P>Having pass'd thro' these Points of <HI>Repentance,</HI> there is in it, Lastly, A <HI>Returning</HI> to GOD in our Lord JE∣SUS CHRIST. So we read; Hos. 6.1. <HI>Come, Let us Return unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Repenting Sinner,</HI> first, flies to the <HI>Pardoning Mercy</HI> of God in our Lord Jesus Christ. <HI>Repentance</HI> is accompanied with <HI>Hope;</HI> An <HI>Hope of Pardoning Mercy;</HI> and with an <HI>Hope∣ful Prayer</HI> for a <HI>Pardon.</HI> An <HI>Hopeless Re∣pentance,</HI> is a <HI>Repentance</HI> for none but a <HI>Judas,</HI> none but a <HI>Devil.</HI> The <HI>Repent∣ing</HI> Sinner, is not a <HI>Despairing</HI> Sinner. He is upheld with that Perswasion; Psal 130.4. <HI>There is Forgiveness with thee, that thou moyst be Feared.</HI></P>
<P>Now, tis a Glorious CHRIST, who is his <HI>Hope.</HI> The <HI>Repenting Sinner</HI> flies to that <HI>Hope,</HI> as his only <HI>Refuge,</HI> 1 Joh. 1.7. <HI>The Blood of</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>the
<PB N="14" REF="001462_0016_0FB34AEBE4DD5120"/>
Son of God, Cleanseth us from all Sin.</HI> A <HI>Repenting</HI> Soul, is a <HI>Believing</HI> Soul. His Cry is; <HI>Lord, Let my Sin be Pardoned, because a Glorious</HI> CHRIST <HI>is my Sacri∣fice and my Advocate. Lord. My whole Dependence is on a Glorious</HI> CHRIST, <HI>that I may find Mercy and Pardon with thee!</HI></P>
<P>And then, the <HI>Repenting Sinner</HI> comes to New <HI>Resolutions.</HI> He <HI>Resolves</HI> with the Help of Grace, to Glorify GOD, with a New, and more Exact Obedience. Tis with him, as we read, Job 34.31, 32. <HI>I will not Offend any more; If I have done Iniquity, I will do it no more.</HI> He <HI>Forsakes</HI> every Sin. He <HI>Wishes, Oh! That I might not Sin any more!</HI> He <HI>Chuses</HI> the Blessed GOD for <HI>his God.</HI> He <HI>Re∣solves</HI> to Obey Him. His <HI>Desires</HI> are; <HI>Oh! That my Life may be a Walk with God! Lord, I am Thine; I Resolve, with thy Help, to Acknowledge thee in all my Wayes!</HI> If an <HI>Austin</HI> were here, he would say unto you, <HI>Inanis est Paenitentia, quam sequens Culpa coinquinat. Repenting</HI> will be in vain, if <HI>Relapsing</HI> be not mightily watch'd against.</P>
<P>THIS, This is <HI>Repentance;</HI> the <HI>Repentance</HI> to be for ever breathing
<PB N="15" REF="001462_0017_0FB34AED613BB890"/>
in us, as long as we have a Breath to draw in the World. The Soul of a Christian should be, strongly Turned <HI>this Way;</HI> always Tending <HI>this Way.</HI> To be <HI>Repenting</HI> at this rate, must be the Daily Study and Labour of a Good Man. <HI>Essayes</HI> of such <HI>Repen∣tance,</HI> must be Livelily carried on, as long as we Live.</P>
<P>Wherefore, The Second Thing to be now done, is to Enquire,</P>
<P><HI>What are the <HI>Occasions,</HI> which to keep <HI>Repentance in a Continual Erercise,</HI> we are to Lay Hold upon?</HI></P>
<P>I am going to set before you a <HI>Mystery of Practical Godliness,</HI> which rarely has been fully spoken to. I am going to <HI>Shew you an Excellent Way,</HI> for a Good Man to be always <HI>Repenting</HI> the Errors of his Life as long as he Lives. A Se∣rious, Watchful, <HI>Self-abasing Mind,</HI> may lay hold on Thousands of <HI>Occasions,</HI> to Cry out; <HI>Wo is me, I am Unclean: Lord, I Repent before thee, and I Entreat a Pardon, thro' the Blood of the Lamb of God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="001462_0018_0FB34AEF086DD640"/>¶ First, There are <HI>Solemn Acts of Repentance,</HI> to be frequently Performed, frequently Repeted.</P>
<P>My Intention is This. We are fre∣quently to <HI>Set a part a Time,</HI> on purpose to go thro' a <HI>Process of Repen∣tance,</HI> in all the <HI>Parts</HI> of it, and all the <HI>Acts</HI> of it. This <HI>Time</HI> is to be thus divided. Having first implored the <HI>Assistance</HI> of Heaven, then, O Ser∣vant of God, Go on to take a view of thy <HI>Original Sin;</HI> thy wretched, forlorn, filthy circumstances, by rea∣son of <HI>Original Sin.</HI> There-withal set before thee an, <HI>Exposition of the Ten Commandments;</HI> what is <HI>Forbidden,</HI> what is <HI>Required,</HI> in them. Examine the <HI>Faults of thy Life</HI> by this <HI>Glass. Acknowledge</HI> the Faults, with Bit∣terness of Soul before the Lord. Glo∣rify GOD in the Bitterest <HI>Chastisements,</HI> which thou hast felt, or canst feel, for thy offences. Weep to the Lord, for a <HI>Pardon,</HI> thro' the <HI>Propitiation</HI> of the Lovely JESUS. Lay Hold on the <HI>Par∣doning Mercy</HI> of God. Here-upon, take up agreeable <HI>Purposes,</HI> of Living more Carefully, more Fruitfully, more Ho∣lily.
<PB N="17" REF="001462_0019_0FB34AF19C115550"/>
<HI>Record</HI> your <HI>Purposes.</HI> Make and Keep a <HI>Record</HI> of them. Afterwards, Fail not of <HI>Execution.</HI></P>
<P>Sirs, A <HI>Time</HI> should be now and then Devoted unto this Intention. Es∣pecially, when we <HI>Prepare</HI> to Approach the <HI>Table of the Lord;</HI> This, This is to be One considerable Stroke of our <HI>Preparation.</HI> Yea, sometimes a Servant of God, should set apart, a <HI>Whole Day</HI> upon this Intention; A <HI>Day of Humiliation.</HI> And, why not in <HI>Secret Places</HI> before the Lord! Methinks, I hear the Glorious Lord saying unto us; Isa. 58.6. <HI>Is not this the Fast that I have chosen? To loose the Bands of Wick∣edness.</HI> Verily, such <HI>Dayes of Repentance</HI> must be frequent with us; Even to the End of our Dayes. But,</P>
<P>Secondly. Methinks, every <HI>New</HI> and <HI>Gross Fall into Sin,</HI> Oh! it affords us a deplorable occasion! It should immediately put us on a <HI>New</HI> &amp; <HI>Fresh</HI> Act of the most <HI>Explicit Repentance.</HI> When a <HI>Peter</HI> has Fallen, what is to be done Immediately? What, but That; Matt, 26.75. <HI>He went out, and wept bitterly.</HI> If <HI>Temptation</HI> has gain'd at any time up∣on
<PB N="18" REF="001462_0020_0FB34AF2A60060D8"/>
on us, and has drawn us into any <HI>Mis∣carriage,</HI> for which our <HI>Hearts Condemn</HI> us; <HI>Now</HI> is a Time for us immediately to <HI>Retire</HI> and <HI>Repent</HI> before the Lord, &amp; <HI>Weep Bitterly. Now, Now,</HI> Let US, With∣out any Delay, Go alone, and Lament our <HI>Foolishness,</HI> and Beg of the Glorious LORD, That He would <HI>Forgive</HI> our Iniquity, and <HI>preserve,</HI> us from ever fall∣ing again into the like Iniquity. My Friend; Thy <HI>Soul</HI> should be in as much pain as a <HI>Bone out of joynt,</HI> until this <HI>Repentance</HI> has <HI>Restored</HI> thee.</P>
<P>I design a particular pungency in it, that I now refer to this Head, what I might have made a distinct One. Our <HI>Well-doing</HI> as well as our <HI>Ill-do∣ing</HI> affords us an <HI>occasion of Repentance.</HI> When we have done any <HI>Service</HI> for God; appear'd as <HI>Witnesses</HI> for Him; done <HI>Good Offices</HI> for His People; or perhaps been Scattering our <HI>Alms</HI> like the Showres of Heaven; Instead of be∣ing <HI>Lifted up,</HI> now <HI>full down</HI> before the Lord; <HI>Lord, I am asham'd, I am asham'd that my Service, has been so poorly &amp; meanly performed: Lord, The Iniquity of my Holy Things abases me Exceedingly!</HI> I incor∣porate
<PB N="19" REF="001462_0021_0FB34AF429E5C4E0"/>
our <HI>Ill-doing,</HI> and our <HI>Well-doing,</HI> into one Paragraph of my <HI>Discourse,</HI> be∣cause, God knows, we do in our <HI>Practice</HI> too much incorporate them.</P>
<P>There is a Third Occasion for the Exercise of <HI>Repentance,</HI> which the <HI>E∣vening of Every day</HI> brings unto us. Every <HI>Evening,</HI> before we go to our <HI>Lodging,</HI> we should go to our <HI>Clo∣set.</HI> There call to mind, as, what <HI>Spe∣cial Mercies</HI> of the Day past we have to be <HI>Thankful</HI> for, so what <HI>Special Evils</HI> of the Day past, we have to be <HI>Humbled</HI> for Child of God, How canst thou <HI>Sleep</HI> comfortably, without some such Exercise. Look back on the Day past, and on thy Knees before the Lord, mention those <HI>Errors,</HI> which thou, <HI>Canst understand</HI> in thy Conduct? <HI>Lord, My Unfruitfulness this Day! Lord, my want of Zeal in the Duties of Religion! Lord, my Indiscreet Behaviour, in such and such Com∣pany! Oh, Pardon it, for the sake of the only Sacrifice, and Assist me, that I may no more, so sin against thee!</HI> Now Fall Asleep, with that Song of <HI>Zion;</HI> Psal. 48. <HI>I will both lay me down in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and Sleep; for thou, Lord, only makest me dwell in safey.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="001462_0022_0FB34AF60053E490"/>My Neighbours, If you have passed any <HI>One Day</HI> without making Work for <HI>Re∣pentance,</HI> you shall be Excused from the Task now laid upon you!</P>
<P>You will find a Fourth Occasion for the Exercise of <HI>Repentance,</HI> in <HI>Every Errand that you go to Heaven upon.</HI> We can <HI>Request</HI> nothing of the Holy GOD, but we may <HI>Repent</HI> of something, which this thing may lead us to Think upon. A <HI>Prayer</HI> for a Mercy, must be all upon the <HI>Base;</HI> and the Note must be That; Luk. 18.13. <HI>God be Merciful to me a Sinner.</HI> Suppli∣ant, When ever thou dost make any <HI>Supplication</HI> to GOD for a <HI>Mercy,</HI> not only Bewayl the <HI>Sins,</HI> which render thee unworthy of <HI>all Mercy,</HI> but also more Distinctly Seek for, and Find out, and Bewayl the Sins that render thee more notoriously unworthy of <HI>that Mercy</HI> Make a Distinct Recognition, That for <HI>Such a Sin,</HI> and for <HI>Such a Sin,</HI> thou De∣servest, that the <HI>Petition</HI> thou art now Prosecuting, should be Rejected of Heaven. This <HI>Repentance,</HI> Oh! what an agreeable <HI>Introduction</HI> to the Favours of the Lord!</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="001462_0023_0FB34AF71EB87C98"/>I will mind you of a Fifth Occasion, for the Exercise of <HI>Repentance;</HI> but it is a very <HI>Comprehensive</HI> One, a very <HI>Accu∣mulative</HI> One. It shall be, when-ever any <HI>Truths</HI> of GOD, and of His Gospel, are Conversed withal. When∣ever you see any thing more of GOD and CHRIST, say, as <HI>Job</HI> did, upon such an Invitation; <HI>Lord, Now I abhor my self, and Repent.</HI> We read, of such a thing as that; Mark 1.14, 15. <HI>Preach∣ing the Gospel, and Saying, Repent &amp; Be∣lieve the Gospel.</HI> There are no <HI>Truths</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> but what contain Admoni∣tions to <HI>Repentance</HI> in them. When you hear a <HI>Vertue</HI> commended, Certainly you may say, <HI>Lord, I am Sorry, that I have so little of this Vertue in me!</HI> When you hear a <HI>Duty</HI> propounded, certainly, you may say, <HI>Lord, I am Sorry, that I have been so defective in doing this Duty.</HI> When you hear any <HI>Sin</HI> Rebuked, certainly, you will see cause to say, <HI>Lord, I Mourn for a Degree of that Sin found upon me.</HI> My Hearers, when did you Hear a <HI>Sermon,</HI> which might not put you in mind of Something to be <HI>Repented</HI> of! When you have been <HI>Meditating</HI> on a∣ny
<PB N="22" REF="001462_0024_0FB34AF8A0A17848"/>
<HI>Truths</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> the <HI>Meditation</HI> should Expire with Something of this importance; <HI>What can I now find in my self to be Repented of?</HI> Especially, if the <HI>Glory,</HI> the wondrous <HI>Glory,</HI> of GOD and CHRIST, be at any time set before you, Oh! the <HI>Self-abhorance,</HI> which you ought hereupon to be cast into! Have you seen the, <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy Lord of Hosts and of Times?</HI> Cry out with <HI>Repentance</HI> and Amazement, <HI>Ah, Wo is me! I am an Unholy Creature, a Pollu∣ted Creature. How unlike the Holy One! How unfit to hold Communion with Him!</HI> You see, Our Excellent <HI>Esaias</HI> did so.</P>
<P>Will the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel, permit the meanest of their Number, to let fall a <HI>Word to the Wise,</HI> as we go along! Before we <HI>Preach</HI> a <HI>Sermon,</HI> Sirs, we have something to do in our <HI>Studies,</HI> And this is One Thing. When we are Studying a <HI>Sermon,</HI> we should make a Pause on every Paragraph, to bring a∣bout an Impression thereof on our own Souls, [The most significant way of <HI>having our Sermons by Heart!</HI>] We should <HI>Examine</HI> our own <HI>Miscarriages,</HI> relating to the <HI>Truths,</HI> which we are going
<PB N="23" REF="001462_0025_0FB34AFB5E0BB620"/>
to Deliver unto our People. We should on our Knees, humble our selves before the Lord for our own <HI>Miscarriages,</HI> and implore the Pardon of them thro' the Blood of the only Sacrifice. In our going forth to Preach a <HI>Sermon,</HI> we should also first of all, in Secret, Ac∣knowledge before the Lord, our great <HI>Unworthiness,</HI> to be Employ'd by Him in Holy Ministrations, among His Peo∣ple. The greater the Service is that we have before us, the more we should lay our selves in the Dust, with <HI>Repenting</HI> Self-Annihilations. <HI>Now, Now</HI> we shall <HI>Preach</HI> with <HI>Lips touch'd by a Coal from the Altar; Now</HI> our God will make us as <HI>His Mouth</HI> unto our Auditories. But yet, after our Work in the Publick is over, we should Lament before the Lord, all the <HI>Sloth,</HI> all the <HI>Pride,</HI> all the <HI>Indifference of Soul,</HI> and <HI>Want of Compassion</HI> to the Souls of o∣thers, &amp; whatever <HI>Discomposure</HI> of mind has attended us: All our <HI>Negligence</HI> in doing the Work of the Lord.</P>
<P>You shall take notice of a Sixth Oc∣casion, for the Exercise of <HI>Repentance.</HI> You shall see it, in the <HI>Administra∣tion of the Sacraments.</HI> what
<PB N="24" REF="001462_0026_0FB34AFC609D22E8"/>
is <HI>Baptism?</HI> We read, Mark 1.4. <HI>The Baptism of Repentance.</HI> As often as you see any person <HI>Baptised,</HI> so often think; <HI>I see, I see, that we all bring into the World with us Sinful Nature, deeply to be Repented of.</HI> And so often, O ye <HI>Bap∣tised</HI> ones, Call to mind your own <HI>For∣getfulness</HI> of your own <HI>Baptismal Vows;</HI> A <HI>Forgetfulness</HI> that cannot be too often, or too sadly, <HI>Repented</HI> of. Every <HI>Bap∣tism</HI> among us, would be a <HI>Sermon,</HI> if' it were thus improved, for the promoting of our own <HI>Repentance.</HI> But then, O Communicant at the <HI>Table</HI> of the Lord; Remember, Thou hast before thee, an Ordinance which belongs to none but <HI>Repenting</HI> Souls. Do not ven∣ture to come, without some Solemn <HI>Renewal</HI> of <HI>Repentance,</HI> every time you come. And when <HI>There</HI> you see Him, whom you have <HI>Pierced by your Sins,</HI> Will you not <HI>Mourn;</HI> and shall not the <HI>Wounds</HI> of your own Souls <HI>Bleed afresh?</HI> When you have <HI>Evidently set forth before your Eyes,</HI> a CHRIST <HI>Crucified</HI> for your <HI>Sins,</HI> won't you bring your <HI>Sins</HI> to the <HI>Cross</HI> of the Lord, that <HI>they</HI> may be there <HI>Cru∣cified</HI> &amp; Mortified? The <HI>Death</HI> of thy

<HI>Saviour,</HI> Exhibited at His <HI>Table,</HI> my Friend, it must give a <HI>New Life</HI> to thy <HI>Repentance</HI> for thy <HI>Sin;</HI> a New Blow towards the <HI>Death</HI> of thy <HI>Sin.</HI></P>
<P>Yea; There is a <HI>Seventh</HI> Occasion for the Exercise of <HI>Repentance;</HI> and it may be called, a <HI>Seven-fold</HI> Occasion, a <HI>Many-fold</HI> Occasion. I will sum it up in one Term. You have it in every <HI>Dis∣pensation</HI> of God, whether it be a <HI>Comfortable Dispensation,</HI> or whether it be a <HI>Calamitous Dispensation,</HI> there is a Call in it; REPENT, REPENT; That is the Call.</P>
<P>First; You have your <HI>Enjoy∣ments.</HI> But, what <HI>Use</HI> are you to make of them? You are advised; Rom. 2.4. <HI>The Goodness of God Leads thee to Re∣pentance.</HI> Oh! Let your <HI>Enjoyments</HI> cause you to think; <HI>What, Oh! how much, have I been and done, to Forfeit such Enjoyments! How Gloriously does the Sove∣reign Grace of Heaven, triumph over an Ill-deserving Sinner, in such Enjoyments!</HI> Think thus upon every one of them, as far as you can. Have <HI>Days of Thanksgiving</HI> for it. Man, Does GOD Smile upon thee? O <HI>Repent,</HI> and
<PB N="26" REF="001462_0028_0FB34AFF609A7B38"/>
<HI>Wonder,</HI> because thou dost <HI>not Perish!</HI> Every <HI>Morsel of Meat</HI> on thy Table, may be Eaten, with <HI>Wonder,</HI> that it is bestow'd upon such an <HI>Ill-deserving Sin∣ner.</HI> Eat thy <HI>Morsel,</HI> with the <HI>Bitter Herbs</HI> of <HI>Repentance:</HI> It will be the <HI>Sweeter</HI> for it.</P>
<P>And then; You have your <HI>Affli∣ctions.</HI> But what should they drive you to? To <HI>Repentance.</HI> This is the Advice of Heaven; Job 34.31. <HI>Surely, It is meet to be said unto God, I have born Chastisement, I will not Offend any more.</HI> Let your <HI>Afflictions</HI> cause you to think, <HI>What, What are the Iniquities, that have procured me those Afflictions? Wherein have I rendred my self worthy of such Afflictions</HI>' Do thus upon every one of them. Child, Let not so much as a Fit of the <HI>Tooth-ake</HI> take thee, without some such Reflections. It is a dreadful Brand upon any man; <HI>In the Time of his Distress, he Sins yet more against the Lord;</HI> And, <HI>He Repents not of the Sin for which God is now smiting of him.</HI></P>
<P>Oh, Let both <HI>Prosperity</HI> and <HI>Adversi∣ty,</HI> bring us down into the <HI>Dust and Ashes</HI> of <HI>Repentance</HI> before the Lord.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="001462_0029_0FB34B021E45C180"/>I will go on, and make an Eighth Occasion for the Exercise of <HI>Repentance.</HI> Tis, when a man is <HI>Reproved</HI> by his Neighbour; yea, I will add, And when a man is <HI>Reproached</HI> by his Neighbour. My Friend, Has a Kind and a Just <HI>Reproof</HI> been given to thee? Receive it with <HI>Repentance. Repent,</HI> and Reform, what is Amiss. Don't <HI>Have Reproof:</HI> God calls that man, a <HI>Bruit,</HI> who will do so. But if a <HI>Reproof</HI> be en∣tertained with <HI>Repentance,</HI> it will appear in this; It will be Entertained with a suitable <HI>Thankfulness. Reproved</HI> Christi∣an, say with him ; Psal 141.5. <HI>Let the Righteous Smite me, it shall be a Kindness; and let him Reprove me, it shall be an Ex∣cellent Oyl.</HI> Oh, Love and Thank thy <HI>Reprover;</HI> Thankfully Address him, with a, <HI>Blessed be thou of the Lord, and Blessed be the Lord that hath sent thee to me</HI> But, perhaps you are Defamed, Abused, <HI>Reproached.</HI> The World is full of <HI>Re∣proaches.</HI> Well, But by <HI>Repentance,</HI> a <HI>Re∣proached</HI> Child of God, may not only <HI>Shake off a Viper,</HI> but also fetch a <HI>Treacle out of a Viper.</HI> When you have to do with a <HI>Calumnious Man,</HI> you, have also
<PB N="28" REF="001462_0030_0FB34B0321E73300"/>
to do with a <HI>Righteous God.</HI> You may say, as he, 2 Sam. 16.11. <HI>The Lord hath bidden him.</HI> Now, my Brethren, Your Business is to Search out, <HI>Why</HI> the <HI>Lord hath bidden him,</HI> and <HI>Repent</HI> of the <HI>Sin,</HI> which has provoked your Father, to Employ the <HI>Scourge</HI> of the <HI>Tongue,</HI> or the <HI>Pen,</HI> upon you. Tho' the Thing spoken of you be a Cursed <HI>Falshood</HI> &amp; <HI>Slander,</HI> yet you shall thus turn into a <HI>Blessing,</HI> Let it set you a thinking, <HI>How far am I to blame, in that thing for which I am Evil spoken of ? However, I may be sure, I am to blame for something. What, what it is that the Glorious One sees Blameworthy in me, for which He permits me to be buffeted with such Re∣proaches?</HI> Don't Leave off, till the <HI>Lyes</HI> of Ill-minded People, awaken you to discover something that is <HI>truly</HI> to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of. Oh ! how much may we advance in <HI>Repentance,</HI> and in <HI>All Good-ness</HI> by being <HI>Evil-spoken</HI> of! It may be an Advantage unto a <HI>Lazarus,</HI> to have a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Licking his <HI>Ulcers.</HI> Yea, and if we attempt our own <HI>just Vindi∣cation,</HI> Let it be managed with <HI>Much Humility.</HI> Let the <HI>Spirit of Repentance,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="001462_0031_0FB34B04B3CBE728"/>
Dictate, and Mollify, and Lenify all that we say, when we vindicate our selves. Old <HI>Ambrose</HI> was in the Right of it; <HI>Qui Paenitentiam agit, paratus de∣bet esse ad opprobria perferenda, injuriasque subeundas.</HI></P>
<P>I will Suggest a Ninth Occasion for the Exercise of <HI>Repentance.</HI> Tis, when we see the <HI>Actions of other Men.</HI> Do you see ary <HI>Laudable Actions,</HI> done by ther men? Blush, Blush, O Christian of slow Pace, to think; <HI>How much do I lag behind that Excellent, Lively, Fruitful Servant of God!</HI> But you may see <HI>Cri∣minal Actions</HI> done by other men. What is now to be done, but That? Psal. 119.158. <HI>I beheld the Transgressor, and was grieved.</HI> We may be <HI>Grieved,</HI> because <HI>Their Transgressons</HI> may mind us of <HI>Our Own.</HI> When we See or Hear a <HI>Wicked Thing</HI> done by any man, Think; <HI>Was I never my self Guilty of Such a thing?</HI> If Guilty, Oh <HI>Repent</HI> over again. Be that as it is, what ever <HI>Wickedres</HI> we know committed in the World, it should cause us to lay to Heart, our own Wicked, Corrupt, Vicious Nature. It should cause us <HI>Smite our Heart</HI> and say, <HI>A∣las
<PB N="30" REF="001462_0032_0FB34B0620065570"/>
Alas, I should soon fall into that wicked∣ness, if Left unto my self.</HI> To Think so, is to <HI>Repent</HI> in one signal way of doing it.</P>
<P>With a Tenth Occasion for the Exer∣cise of <HI>Repentance,</HI> I will shut up all. Tis, <HI>in the <HI>Iudgments of God,</HI></HI> up∣on a Sinsul World. If we see any <HI>Dis∣mal Thing</HI> befal any <HI>One Person,</HI> Oh! Let it Quicken us to Think. <HI>Wherein have I deserved such a dismal Fate!</HI> And, <HI>Re∣pent, Repent,</HI> Lest it prove also <HI>our</HI> Dis∣mal Fate. So, when a Sad Accident befell some unhappy People, our Savi∣our made that Application of it; Luk. 13.3. <HI>Except ye Repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</HI> But then, in a time of <HI>General Judgments</HI> on the <HI>World,</HI> and on the <HI>place</HI> where we live; How Penitently should we think; <HI>What share has my Sin had, in Pulling down these Judgments ? What have I done, to increase the Heap of Wrath, which overwhelms the World? What are the Epidemical Sins, which provoke the Displeasure of Heaven; and how far have I Sinfully conformed unto them?</HI></P>
<P>It is Observable, That our Admira∣ble <HI>Esaias</HI> cryes out upon himself, <HI>I dwell in the midst of a people of Unclean
<PB N="31" REF="001462_0033_0FB34B086404CB70"/>
Lips.</HI> Our Incomparable <HI>Witsins</HI> has an Holy Note upon it; <HI>Notatu dignum est, quod Semetipsos Sancti Prophetae, uti partem Populi consideraverint, sic ut sibi quodammodo attribuerent Crimina quae Po∣pulus Perpetraverat; neque minus de ijs Erubuerint, quam si al quam in eorum com∣munione partem habuissent.</HI> In Short; <Q>It is worth Noting, that the Holy men of God, so considered themselves for a <HI>Part of the People,</HI> as to condemn them∣selves for the <HI>Sins</HI> committed among the People; They took <HI>Shame</HI> to them∣selves, for the <HI>common Sins,</HI> as if they had themselves taken <HI>Part</HI> in them, and held <HI>Communion</HI> with them.</Q></P>
<P>I have bespoke it, that we <HI>Live Re∣penting.</HI> You understand my Intenti∣on also, <HI>To Dy so.</HI> One of the Best of Men, that very Aged and very Useful Servant of God, <HI>Francis Tallents,</HI> when he lay a dying, and was become able to Speak but little, <HI>Then</HI> said, <HI>Here I ly Endeavouring to Renew my Repentance for all my Sins, from the Beginning to this Day. Oh! I would not think, that my weakness and illness may Excuse me from the Exercise of Repentance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="001462_0034_0FB34B09DF75E0F8"/>I have done. I am sensible, T'were <HI>Easy</HI> to find more Occasions for the Exercise of <HI>Repentance.</HI> But, my Hearers, If you will Improve <HI>These,</HI> t'will soon be <HI>Nat'ral</HI> for you, to fall upon many more.</P>
<P>To demonstrate this, I will only mention one passage, which I have some-where met withal</P>
<P><Q>I would carry on the Matter, to so much of <HI>watchfulness,</HI> in my apprehending <HI>Opportu∣nities</HI> for <HI>Thoughts of Repentance,</HI> that the Provocations which may happen to be given unto my <HI>Bodily Senses</HI> at any time, shall pro∣voke Such <HI>Thoughts</HI> in my Scul. If I <HI>Smell</HI> any thing that is not Grateful, or <HI>Taste</HI> any thing that is Bitter, My Soul shall fly away to some Thoughts on the <HI>Lothsomeness</HI> and <HI>Bitterness of <HI>Sin</HI></HI> immediately. A <HI>Fresh Abhorrence of</HI> Sin shall be awakened it me. If I happen to Lodge, where any <HI>Vermine,</HI> and <HI>Insect,</HI> as∣saults me, it shall Humble me. I will think ;<HI>I have been One among the Enemies of God in the World These uneasy Creatures are part of the Armies which the Lord of Hosts Employes, and with some Contempt, against his Enemies.</HI></Q></P>
<P>From so Minute a Passage, you may take an Hint, how Surprisingly the <HI>Excitations of Repen∣tance,</HI> in a Religious and Ingenious Mind, will <HI>Increase and Multiply!</HI></P>
<P>My Friends;These are some of those Me∣thods, by which a Life of Repentance is to
<PB N="33" REF="001462_0035_0FB34B0B61FEFCD8"/>
be carried on. Oh! come into these Methods. I know, you cannot but <HI>Approve</HI> them! You do so, if you <HI>Approve ths things that are Excellent!</HI></P>
<P>If you <HI>do,</HI> I know you cannot but abhor the <HI>Proud Spirit</HI> of <HI>Quakerism, <HI>We have heard of the Pride</HI></HI> of the <HI>Quaker,<HI>(he is very Proud)even, of his haughtiness, and his Pride, and his Wrath;</HI></HI> But his Lies shall not perswade us, that he is attain'd unto the <HI>Perfection,</HI> in which he pre∣tends to be got beyond <HI>Occasions</HI> for the <HI>Daily Exercise of Repentance.</HI> There needs no more to render <HI>Quakerism</HI> abominable to every sensible Christian ; It Extinguishes the <HI>Spirit of Repentance.</HI> There is nothing Plainer, My Friends, than the Diametrical Opposition, be∣tween the <HI>Spirit of Quakerism,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit of Repentance.</HI> A Poor, and Proud Creature, being. <HI>Ignorant of the Righteousness of God,</HI> and of His <HI>Commandment,</HI> which is <HI>Exceeding Broad,</HI> layes his <HI>conscience</HI> Asleep. His <HI>Conscience</HI> wickedly forbears to Convict him of <HI>Numberless Offences,</HI> into which he falls, where-ever he comes every day that comes over his Head. Now. he fan∣cies himself to have arriv'd unto <HI>Perfection,</HI> he has done with <HI>Repentance;</HI> he derides those that Confess themselves, <HI>Miserable Sinners;</HI> he looks upon them with a Supercilious Disdain, and sayes, <HI>Come not near to me, for I am Holier than thou!</HI> Of such Pretenders does the Holy Lord say, <HI>These are a Smoke in my Nose. a Fire that burns all the Day,</HI> that is, <HI>My Anger shall Smoke and burn against them everlastingly.</HI> To these Deluded Neighbours, I cannot but apply those Words; Prov 30.12 <HI>There is a Generation that are
<PB N="34" REF="001462_0036_0FB34B0F2409D098"/>
Pure in their own Eyes, and yet is not washed from their Filthiness.</HI> and unto the rest of the Neigh∣bours, I say, For These <HI>Meetings</HI> which pretend the <HI>Worship of God,</HI> but never Pray for the <HI>Par∣don of Sin,</HI> be cautious, how you come into them. <HI>Soul, Dishonour</HI> not thy self, by being <HI>United</HI> unto such <HI>Assemblies!</HI></P>
<P>But, O my Brethren, Hold on, <HI>Repenting</HI> E∣very day, and often in a Day, and as long as you Live. Yea, Let it not come as a Shocking Paradox upon you, if I tell you, There will something of <HI>Repentance</HI> remain with us, <HI>after we come to Heaven.</HI> After we are in the Sinless and Joyful Glory of the <HI>Heavenly World,</HI> we shall blame our <HI>Old Sins,</HI> more than ever we did in our Lives; and keep wondring▪ won∣dring, at the <HI>Grace</HI> that has brought such <HI>Un∣worthy Sinners</HI> to such a Glory</P>
<P>In the mean time, I must assure you; Tho' a <HI>Life Of Repentance</HI> here may seem an <HI>Austere</HI> one, a <HI>Severe</HI> one; yet even <HI>here</HI> it is a <HI>joyful</HI> one GOD will <HI>dwell</HI> with the <HI>Repenting,</HI> Soul; with that <HI>Humble</HI> and <HI>Contrite</HI> one, A Soul full of God will be a Soul full of <HI>Light</HI> And how <HI>Joyful</HI> will the <HI>Issue</HI> be? How <HI>Joyful</HI> the <HI>Harvest</HI> of all! I Conclude with that, which will be the Conclusion of all; Psal. 126.5 <HI>They that Sow in Tears shall Reap in Joy.</HI></P>
