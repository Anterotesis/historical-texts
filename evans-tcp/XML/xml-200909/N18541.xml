<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>AS the ministry of the gospel is a chief means of the salvation of mankind, it is of great importance for all to have right ideas about the call and characters of the ministers of Christ. Yet mistakes about these things are exceeding com∣mon in the world. And though men generally complain of these evils, yet how few make the holy scriptures their only rule to guard against them? Many exclaim against old <HI>traditious,</HI> who are far from being clear of them themselves; and <HI>oppo∣sition of science, falsely so called,</HI> hath filled the world with <HI>perverse disputings.</HI> And we have abundant evidence, that <HI>the love of money is the root of all evil.</HI> 1 Tim. vi. 5, 10, 20. But as persecution hath not the sword of the magistrate in America to enforce it, <HI>opposition of knowledge</HI> cannot be so fierce here, as in other countries.</P>
<P>When the ensuing discourse was first published, in the year 1754, great violence was exercised against all ministers who were not educated for that work, and supported by worldly power. And a∣mong the multitude of publications since, I have never seen one upon the nature and necessity of an internal call from God to preach his gospel. And as this discourse hath lately been frequently in∣quired
<PB N="vi" REF="024062_0004_0FC2FD5D81A77258"/>after, I have thought proper to revise it, and send it again into the world. For God says, <HI>If any man have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</HI> And if this be essential to the character of a Chris∣tian, how much more for a minister of Christ? And he says, <HI>Ye shall know them by their fruits.</HI> Therefore an attempt is here also made to explain those fruits, as they are plainly described in the holy scriptures. And each person has an equal right to judge for himself about soul-guides, as he can answer it to God, who will finally reward every man according to his works: when no deceitful arts can avail with any teacher or hearer. And deceit and cruelty, under religious pretences, hath brought forth the infidelity and contempt of all vital and practical religion, which so much pre∣vails in our day. Men have been very careful in civil governments, to attribute all the mischiefs therein to inferior officers, or to the people, and not to the HEAD of the government; but in religi∣ous matters, all the hypocrisies and villanies that have appeared among those who have professed to believe the Christian religion, have been turned against the authority of Christ in his church. But the time is nigh, when the deaf shall hear the words of God's book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of darkness; the meek also shall increase their joy in the Lord, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the holy One of Israel.</P>

<HEAD>THE NATURE AND NECESSITY <HI>OF AN</HI> Internal Call to preach the Gospel.</HEAD>
<P>THE public preaching of the gospel, is as plain an ordinance of God as any one that he ever instituted; and the importance of it is acknowledged by all men who profess any re∣gard to the truth of Christianity. But how men are called into that work, and how others may know them, so as to obey the gospel, and avoid deceivers, are questions which have filled the world with controversy. And as true believers are al∣ways the best subjects of civil government, deceit∣ful men have held them in bondage, ever since the sword of the magistrate was brought into the church of Christ. Ministers had assumed the place of lawgivers and judges for the church, before Con∣stantine came to the throne; and it is said, "He confirmed with his royal authority, the canons and determinations of the bishops, which they had de∣creed in their consistories, that so the princes of other nations might not abrogate their decrees. For the judgment of the <HI>priesthood</HI> in ecclesiastical matters, is to be preferred before the opinion of a secular judge." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eusebius's life of Constantine, p. 61.</NOTE> And from that day to this, the
<PB N="8" REF="024062_0006_0FC2FD6E5B351680"/>prejudices of natural affection, education, honor, gain, and self-righteousness, have all conspired a∣gainst allowing each one to answer a good con∣science towards God in all the affairs of his worship. The sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, gave a deadly wound to the power of the beast, in the REFORMATION two hundred and seventy-five years ago; but that deadly wound was soon heal∣ed, so that deceit and cruelty, which is the charac∣ter of the devil and his children, hath been carried as far round the world by Protestants, as ever it was by Papists. And the <HI>priesthood</HI> of Jesus Christ, and of his children, is as much disregarded under the one as the other of these names. For the in∣spired apostle Peter says to every true believer, Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren; see that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently: being born again, not of corrupt∣ible seed, but incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth forever.—And this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you. Wherefore, laying aside all malice, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envies, and all evil-speakings, as new-born babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby; if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious: to whom com∣ing, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious; ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an <HI>holy priesthood,</HI> to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.—Ye are a chosen genera∣tion, a <HI>royal priesthood,</HI> an holy nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his marvellous light. 1 Peter i. 22—25. ii. 1—9.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="024062_0007_0FC2FD6F617DF598"/>
Every person who is born again, is a priest unto God, and is required daily to offer up spiritual sa∣crifices to God by Jesus Christ. And these are the only priesthood, and holy nation, that he hath un∣der heaven. And our Lord says, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not see the kingdom of heaven. Whosoever, there∣fore, shall humble himself as this little child, the same is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Mat. xviii. 3, 4. And it is out of such little child∣ren, that the Son of God calls forth his ministers, who are never called priests in the new-testament, in distinction from the brethren. And the propo∣sition that I mean to prove is,</P>
<P><HI>That every true minister of Christ, is called into that work by the same Holy Spirit, that all his pro∣phets and apostles were of old.</HI> And I shall endeav∣our to explain this proposition, and then prove it, and vindicate it against various objections. In explaining of it, I would observe, that all the wri∣ters of the oracles of God, were endued by him with power to work miracles to confirm the words which they published; which power is not given to his ordinary ministers, among people who pro∣fess to own the truth of revelation. After the res∣urrection of our Lord, he appeared unto the <HI>eleven,</HI> and said unto them, Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature. He that be∣lieveth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned.—And they went forth, and preached every where, the Lord work∣ing with them, and <HI>confirming the word with signs following.</HI> Amen. Mark xvi. 14—20. But since the sacred volume is compleated, and miracles are ceased, the ministers of Christ have not that power from him: Though the <HI>man of sin</HI> was advanced
<PB N="10" REF="024062_0008_0FC2FD7607375210"/>in the <HI>temple of God,</HI> which is his church, with <HI>powers, and signs, and lying wonders,</HI> and with <HI>all deceivableness of unrighteousness,</HI> in them that perish; because they received not the <HI>love of the truth that they might be saved.</HI> 2 Thess. ii. 3—10. <HI>Faith which worketh by love,</HI> is the only thing which availeth any soul before God. Gal. v. 6. And, <HI>speaking the truth in love,</HI> is the only way of grow∣ing up into Christ, the HEAD of the church. Eph. iv. 15. Who says, <HI>If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Fa∣ther's commandments, and abide in his love.</HI> John xv. 10. And to guard against <HI>mockers,</HI> who walk after their own <HI>ungodly lusts,</HI> the command to be∣lievers is, <HI>Keep yourselves in the love of God, look∣ing for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.</HI> Jude 18—21. Obedience to the revealed will of God, is the only way of safety and happiness, both for ministers and people. It was equally so with his church before the Son of God gave him∣self a <HI>sacrifice</HI> for us, as it is since, and will be to the end of the world. And that every true mini∣ster of Christ, is internally called into that work by the same Spirit that the prophets and apostles were, I think is evident, from the following considerations.</P>
<P N="1">I. They come in the name of the eternal JE∣HOVAH, as really as any of his servants did of old. Moses was to say, I AM hath sent me unto you. Exod. iii. 14. And Ezekiel was to say, <HI>Thus saith the Lord God,</HI> whether they would hear, or whether they would forbear. Ezek. ii. 4, 5. So Jesus says, Before Abraham was, I AM. John viii. 58. Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them <HI>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;</HI> teaching them to observe all things whatsoever <HI>I have commanded you: and lo,</HI> I AM
<PB N="11" REF="024062_0009_0FC2FD776CFCB558"/><HI>with you alway even unto the end of the world.</HI> Amen. Mat. xxviii. 19, 20. Thus every true minister of Christ, acts in the name of the great I AM; and therefore must be called into the work by his Spirit.</P>
<P N="11">II. God is as near to his church as ever he was, and therefore no men can be invested with power in his room, to call forth his ministers. The judges, priests, and kings in Israel, were only to execute the laws of God, which he revealed by his prophets. And God said, the man that will do <HI>presumptuously,</HI> and will not hearken unto the priest (that standeth to minister there before the Lord thy God) or unto the judge, even that man shall die; and thou shalt put away the evil from Israel. And if they would set up a king over them, he must be first <HI>chosen</HI> by God, from among their <HI>bre∣thren;</HI> and he was to read in the law of God all the days of his life, that his heart might not be lifted up above his <HI>brethren.</HI> Deut. xvii. 11—20. And Jesus is the only antetype of Moses, Aaron, and David. Acts ii. 22—36. iii. 22, 23. Heb. v. 1—6. And he says to his church, Verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth, as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in heaven. For where two or three are gathered together <HI>in my name, there am I in the midst of them.</HI> Mat. xviii. 15—20. To meet <HI>in his name,</HI> is to meet according to <HI>his commandment,</HI> with which his <HI>promise</HI> is con∣nected, <HI>Lo I am with you alway even unto the end of the world.</HI> And as he is always with the faithful, he as really calls forth his ministers, by his word and Spirit, as he ever did in ancient times.</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="12" REF="024062_0010_0FC2FD7D65CA54E8"/>
III. The children of men, yea, the children of God, are as incapable to determine who shall be his ministers, as they were formerly. And an in∣spired apostle says, After that, in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleas∣ed God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.—God hath <HI>chosen</HI> the foolish things of the world, to confound the wise; and God hath <HI>chosen</HI> the weak things of the world, to confound the things that are mighty; and base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God <HI>chosen,</HI> yea, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are; that no flesh should glory in his presence. 1 Cor. i. 21—29. This he now doth, both as to his children and his minis∣ters, as much as he did in the apostolic age. And men must shut their eyes against the light of rea∣son, as well as the light of revelation, not to see this in his late wonderful works among the nations. And yet many of the children of God are still dis∣puting, who shall be the greatest. The apostle John, under that disposition, once said, Master, we saw one casting out devils in thy name, and he fol∣loweth not <HI>us;</HI> and we forbad him, because he followeth not <HI>us.</HI> But Jesus said, Forbid him not; for there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name, that can lightly speak evil of me. Mark ix. 33—39. The <HI>line of things,</HI> which is made ready to our hand, says, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord. For not he that commendeth him∣self, is approved, but whom the Lord commendeth. 2 Cor. x. 16—18. This <HI>line</HI> is drawn by inspira∣tion in the word of God. But many teachers have taken this passage to prove, that all men within <HI>lines</HI> which men have drawn, ought to be forced to support such teachers as are chosen by the rul∣ing
<PB N="13" REF="024062_0011_0FC2FD869C9250D8"/>party therein; and also, that such teachers may forbid all others to preach the gospel within those <HI>lines,</HI> who please them not. Though the great apostle of the Gentiles says, <HI>If I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ.</HI> And he says, If any man preach any other <HI>gospel</HI> unto you, let him be <HI>accursed.</HI> Gal. i. 7—10.</P>
<P N="4">IV. The work of the gospel ministry is essen∣tially as great as ever it was; therefore men are to be called into it by the same holy Spirit that all the servants of God were of old. The church of Christ is built upon the <HI>foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief corner Stone.</HI> Eph. ii. 20. The Jews who built upon their <HI>own righteousness, were in covenant with death, and with hell were at agreement.</HI> Isaiah xxviii. 15, 16. Rom. ix. 32, 33. <HI>For to be carnally minded is death; but to be spiritually minded, is life and peace: because the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</HI> Rom. viii. 6, 7. Loving him with all our powers, and loving our neighbours as ourselves, is the <HI>one thing needful.</HI> Luke x. 27, 28, 42. There∣fore, to love the world, or our own righteousness, above God, is <HI>enmity</HI> against him. And he says, <HI>The friendship of the world is enmity with God.</HI> Jam. iv. 4. And God said to Ezekiel, I have set thee a <HI>watchman</HI> unto the house of Israel; therefore thou shalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. Ezek. xxxiii. 7. So he says by an inspired apostle, Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves; for they <HI>watch for your souls,</HI> as they that must give account: that they may do it with joy, and not with grief; for that is unprofitable for you. Pray for us; for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
<PB N="14" REF="024062_0012_0FC2FD87F171BAE8"/>things willing to live <HI>honestly.</HI> Heb. xiii. 17, 18. But how can ministers live <HI>honestly,</HI> if their <HI>trust</HI> is in an <HI>arm of flesh,</HI> instead of the eternal JEHOVAH! for a <HI>curse</HI> of <HI>blindness</HI> is upon all such men. Jer. xvii. 5—8. Therefore the apostle Paul said to the elders of Ephesus, I take you to record this day, that I am pure from the blood of all men; for I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God. Take heed therefore unto your∣selves, and to all the flock over the which the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood. For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous <HI>wolves</HI> enter in among you, not sparing the flock. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking <HI>perverse things,</HI> to draw away disciples after them. Therefore <HI>watch,</HI> and re∣member that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears. And now brethren, I commend you to God, and to the <HI>word of his grace,</HI> which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them which are sanctified. Acts xx. 26—32.</P>
<P>Elders and overseers or bishops, are here called brethren, by one of the chiefest of the apostles; who informs them, that the Holy Ghost made them overseers of the flock of God; whose power, and the word of his grace, was their sufficient se∣curity against grievous wolves, and perverse dis∣puters. Therefore, as every true minister of Christ, acts in the name of the same God that the prophets and apostles did; and he is as near to his church now as formerly; and men are as unable to deter∣mine who shall be his messengers as ever they were, and their work of watching for souls and feeding Christ's sheep, is as great as ever, I conclude that
<PB N="15" REF="024062_0013_0FC2FD8EA98A9CF0"/>he as really calls them forth by his Spirit now as ever he did in the world. But how does he per∣form this great work? or how are any men now called to preach the gospel? I answer,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Our ascended Lord, by the Holy Spirit, gives the church <HI>gifts for pastors and teachers,</HI> as well as for all other purposes in his kingdom. The Lord gave the word, great was the company of those that published it.—Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive: thou hast received <HI>gifts</HI> for men; yea, for the rebellious also, that the Lord God might dwell among them. And he says to his church, There is one body, and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all. Psalm lxviii. 11, 18. Eph. iv. 4—10. By this heavenly influence, the natural capacities and human accomplishments of believers are sanctified, and they are prepared to fill up their place with duty and usefulness, as much as every member of our natural body doth, under the direction of the head. And they who are de∣signed for preachers of the gospel, have special light given them, and the nature of revelation is opened with great sweetness to their souls. Jere∣miah said, Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and re∣joicing of mine heart. But he met with such cruel treatment, for his faithfulness in his work, that he said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay. Jer. xv. 16. xx. 9. So God said to Ezekiel, Son of man, eat that thou findest; eat this roll, and go
<PB N="16" REF="024062_0014_0FC2FD90357DD130"/>speak unto the house of Israel. So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll; and he said unto me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels, with this roll that I give thee. Then I did eat it, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness. And he said unto me, Son of man, go, get thee unto the house of Israel, and speak with my words unto them. Ezek. iii. 1—4. Also, at the command of God, John took and eat the little book, and says, It was in my mouth sweet as honey; and as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, Thou must pro∣phesy again before many peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings. Rev. x. 8—10. In all which, the sweetness of God's word, and the bitterness of preaching it to a sinful world, is plainly held forth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. A discovery of the worth of souls, and of the state of the church, goes before a call to preach the gospel to them. This is necessary in order for any to be faithful <HI>watchmen.</HI> Hence it is said, When Jesus saw the multitudes, he was moved with com∣passion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as sheep having no shepherd. Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is plenteous, but the labourers are few. Pray ye the Lord of the harvest, that he will send forth la∣bourers into his harvest. And he directly sent forth the twelve into the harvest. Mar. ix. 36—38.x. 1—7. And he sent forth the seventy in the same manner. Luke x. 1—3. And he said, Every scribe which is instructed unto the kingdom of heaven, is like unto a man that is an housholder, which bring∣eth forth out of his treasure things new and old. Mat. xiii. 52. He is diligent, in the use of all lawful means, in storing up knowledge of divine things, and of the state of the church, as well as
<PB N="17" REF="024062_0015_0FC2FD91D7924188"/>the world of mankind; and out of this store he bringeth forth food, to feed the people with know∣ledge and understanding, which is the work of a pastor according to God's own heart. Jer. iii. 15.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. When special gifts are bestowed upon any person, for the great work of the gospel ministry, the authority of Christ requires him to be a faithful steward thereof, as he can answer it to God in the last day. Hence the apostle Paul, after he had given the law of Christ, concerning the support of his ministers, and given notice that he did not ex∣pect it of the church of Corinth, said, <HI>Necessity</HI> is laid upon me; yea, wo is unto me, if I preach not the gospel. 1 Cor. ix. 7—16. But many teachers in our day, insist upon it, that all kind of <HI>necessity</HI> is inconsistent with moral agency. Though, at the same time, they lay a <HI>necessity</HI> upon all around them to yield to their <HI>wills,</HI> or to suffer from them. They are <HI>selfwilled,</HI> under the name of <HI>liberty.</HI> 2 Peter ii. 10, 19. But our Lord said, All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out. For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own <HI>will,</HI> but the <HI>will</HI> of him that sent me. John vi. 37, 38. And who will dare to plead for a moral agency, contrary to the declaration of Christ and his apostles! For they that are such, serve not our Lord Jesus Christ, but their own belly; and by good words and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple. To be <HI>selfwilled,</HI> is the cause of all the sinful <HI>divisions</HI> in the world. Rom. xvi. 17, 18. But God says, As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the
<PB N="18" REF="024062_0016_0FC2FD9DB136E080"/>ability which God giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus Christ; to whom be praise and dominion forever and ever. Amen. 1 Peter iv. 10, 11.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>The means and methods which God makes use of, in calling forth his ministers, are exceeding va∣rious; so that no exact steps can be described by us, for his calling forth his ministers, any more than for his calling souls into the kingdom of his grace. But the teaching of the Spirit of God in his word, a view of the worth of souls and of the present state of things among the people, with the command of Christ to preach his gospel to them, is the essence of an internal call into that great work. The external call is by his church, who are invested with authority from Christ to carry all his laws into execution in his name. For, after warning believers of the danger, of being spoiled through <HI>philosophy and vain deceit,</HI> by men who do not hold THE HEAD, he says, Let the <HI>word of Christ</HI> dwell in you richly in all wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, and hymns, and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to the Lord. And whatsoever ye do in word or deed, do all <HI>in the name</HI> of the Lord Jesus, giv∣ing thanks to God and the Father by him. Col. ii. 8—10, 18—23. iii. 16, 17. In the last of these chapters he says, <HI>Covetousness is idolatry.</HI> And in another place he says, No whoremonger, nor un∣clean person, nor <HI>covetous man who is an idolater,</HI> hath any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ, and of God. Eph. v. 5. And such have ever had a great influence in all national churches, by whom all wars have been managed. But when the house of God, which is his church, shall be established upon his revealed will, above all the powers of this
<PB N="19" REF="024062_0017_0FC2FD9F31168358"/>world, bloody wars will come to an end. And believers will say, <HI>All people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.</HI> Micah iv. 1—5. <HI>The saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom forever, even forever and ever.</HI> Dan. vii. 18. For, though the devil will deceive multitudes, after the reign of the saints for a thou∣sand years, yet their complete destruction will pre∣vent any interruption of the kingdom of the saints. Rev. xx. 7—9. All men desire safety and happi∣ness, and no men would <HI>disobey</HI> the revealed will of God, if they were not <HI>deceived.</HI> Titus iii. 3. Evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, <HI>deceiving,</HI> and being <HI>deceived.</HI> 2 Tim. iii. 13. No men would deceive others, if they were not first deceived themselves. And Christ says, If it were possible, they shall <HI>deceive</HI> the very <HI>elect.</HI> Mat. xxiv. 24. And multitudes are now so much deceived, as to deny that God has an <HI>elect</HI> number among mankind, distinct from the rest. But the apostle Peter writes to the saints, and calls them the <HI>Elect</HI> according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, <HI>through sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience, and sprinkling of the blood of Iesus Christ.</HI> And to them he says, The <HI>elders</HI> which are among you I exhort, who am also an <HI>elder,</HI> and a witness of the suffer∣ings of Christ, and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed; feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither as being <HI>lords</HI> over God's heritage, but being <HI>ensamples</HI> of the flock. And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall re∣ceive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. Like∣wise ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder;
<PB N="20" REF="024062_0018_0FC2FDA0CE2AD4C0"/>yea, all of you be subject one to and be clothed with humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace unto the humble. 1 Peter i. 2. v. 1—5.</P>
<P>Here is an exact description of a church of Christ, and of the government thereof, distinct from all other communities in this world. They are elected by God, and sanctified by his Spirit, and sprinkled by the blood of Christ, our only High Priest. And all of these are an holy priest∣hood. But the chief officers in the church are called <HI>elders,</HI> in distinction from the rest of <HI>God's heritage.</HI> They are also called <HI>overseers</HI> or <HI>bishops.</HI> Acts xx. 28. Titus i. 5, 7. And Peter, the first of the <HI>apostles,</HI> calls himself an <HI>elder.</HI> And it is the <HI>labouring elders,</HI> who are <HI>worthy of their reward.</HI> 1 Tim. v. 17, 18. <HI>And the Lord hath ordained, that they who preach the gospel, should live of the gos∣pel.</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 14. And if an angel from heaven should preach any other <HI>gospel,</HI> than what the apos∣tles <HI>preached,</HI> and the churches then <HI>received,</HI> the command is, <HI>Let him be accursed.</HI> Gal. i. 7—9. For the <HI>gospel</HI> of Christ, saith unto Zion, <HI>Thy God reigneth.</HI> Isaiah lii. 7. Rom. x. 15. His laws, ex∣ecuted by his church, where all must act as little children, is the essence of government therein. For <HI>lordship</HI> is of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> and is excluded from the church of Christ. Mark x. 15, 42, 43. And it is now excluded from the United States of America, and from the government of France; and shall <HI>lordship</HI> be retained by religious ministers? Shall every civil officer be set up, or deposed by the people, and this liberty be denied to the church of Christ? How much hath infidelity been promoted by this tyranny? Yet many objections have been made against our doctrine, the chief of which I shall attempt to answer.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="024062_0019_0FC2FDA4733705E0"/>
The <HI>first</HI> is, that we would set up common min∣isters of the word, as equal with the prophets and apostles. To which I answer, that the apostle Pe∣ter, in the passages now recited, puts himself upon a level with other elders, in the government of the church, saying, God resisteth the proud, and giv∣eth grace to the humble. And he begins his se∣cond epistle by saying, Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have ob∣tained <HI>like precious faith with us, through the righ∣teousness of God, and our Saviour Jesus Christ:</HI> Grace and peace be multiplied unto you, through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord; ac∣cording as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue; whereby are <HI>given unto us exceeding great and precious promises, that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the cor∣ruption that is in the world through lust.</HI> And giv∣ing all diligence, in the pursuit of virtue, know∣ledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, and charity, is the only way that he points out, for us to make our <HI>calling and election sure.</HI> 2 Peter i. 1—10. Therefore all men who hold that they are <HI>elected,</HI> and shall be finally <HI>saved,</HI> with∣out <HI>diligence</HI> in the way of holiness, are deceived. And enemies to salvation by sovereign grace, have taken great advantage from such men. But for any to claim the <HI>promises</HI> of God, without obeying his <HI>precepts,</HI> is <HI>tempting</HI> of him, and not <HI>trusting</HI> in him; which iniquity caused multitudes to lay their <HI>carcases in the wilderness.</HI> And Paul says, Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, left any man fall after the same example of unbelief. Deut. vi. 16, 17. Mat. iv. 7. Heb. iii. 5—11. iv. 11. By
<PB N="22" REF="024062_0020_0FC2FDA61433FF40"/>all which we may see, that the apostles put them∣selves upon a level with every believer, about faith and obedience to God in his church. And one of them says, I wrote unto the church; but Dio∣trephes, who loveth to have the pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. Wherefore if I come, I will remember his deeds which he doth, prating against us with malicious words; and not content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church. 3 John 9, 10. And the world hath been filled with such arbitrary and malicious conduct, ever since the days of Con∣stantine. All ministers who claim a power above the church of Christ, in sending forth his ministers, exalt themselves above the apostles, who claimed no <HI>dominion</HI> over the faith of the church. 2 Cor. i. 24.</P>
<P>Yet a <HI>second</HI> objection against the call now pleaded for, is taken from the words of Paul to Timothy, who said, The things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same com∣mit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. <HI>Commit thou,</HI> is held to be the work of ministers in ordinations, and not of the church. But how little do these objectors regard other things in the same epistle? For therein the apostle says, Hold fast <HI>the form</HI> of sound words, which thou hast heard of me, <HI>in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</HI>—And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to saithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.— This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall come; for men shall be <HI>lovers of their own∣selves</HI>—having <HI>a form</HI> of godliness, but denying the power thereof: from such turn away. 2 Tim. i. 13. ii. 2. iii. 1—5. <HI>The form</HI> of godliness is in
<PB N="23" REF="024062_0021_0FC2FDB1E49FB3B0"/>the holy scriptures; but <HI>a form,</HI> to cover <HI>self-love,</HI> is condemned therein. It is also said, The time will come when they will not endure sound doc∣trine, but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears. And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. 2 Tim. iv. 3, 4. And what heaps of teachers of fables have there been since the apostolic age! and can there be a greater fable, than the conceit is of an external succession of office power in officers from the apostles to our times! For if ministers can initiate children into the church, before they can choose for themselves, and no men but ministers can give or take away that power, they are above all civil rulers upon earth, who are all set up or pulled down by the people. And is not this <HI>the great city, which reign∣eth over the kings of the earth?</HI> Rev. xvii. 18.</P>
<P>Yet, <HI>thirdly,</HI> many object against the internal call now pleaded for, as a thing which would destroy all order in the church. If every man who thinks he is called of God to preach the gospel, is under obligation to do it, will not all manner of confusion take place in the church, and no power on earth can controul them? Thus teachers have reasoned against the call now pleaded for. But who con∣trouled the power of Great-Britain, when they were spurred on by religious teachers, to contend with fire and sword for power to take away our money unjustly? was it not the PEOPLE of America, assisted by the eternal GOD, who maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth? Psalm xlvi. 9. 10. He only calleth any soul out of darkness, into the marvellous light of his gospel; and he says to his royal priest∣hood, and holy nation, <HI>Submit yourselves to every or∣dinance of man for the Lord's sake.</HI> 1 Peter ii. 9, 13
<PB N="24" REF="024062_0022_0FC2FDB33879B3E0"/>If any men invade the rights of their neighbours, the magistrate beareth not the sword in vain; for rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Rom. xiii. 1—10. While false teachers, bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war against him. Micah iii. 5. And if such men are supported by the sword of the magistrate, they are the greatest obstructers of all good order, both in church and state. But when the church of Christ is governed by his laws, she trieth false teachers, as well as false brethren, and is commend∣ed by her Lord for so doing. Rev. ii. 2, 3. It was the one particular church of Ephesus, who per∣formed this acceptable service, and not all the seven churches of Asia; and much less not a con∣vention of all their officers.</P>
<P>Yet, <HI>fourthly,</HI> some insist upon it, that if any think that they are called into the work of the gospel ministry, by the same Spirit who called the prophets and apostles, they must work miracles to confirm their mission. But it is very evident, that working miracles, to confirm the truth of the word of God, was not so great an evidence of the call of a person into the kingdom of grace, or into the ministry, as the works of faith, hope, and charity. 1 Cor. xiii. 1—3, 13. And when a dispute was raised in the church of Corinth, whether Paul was a true minister of Christ, or not, he said, Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men; forasmuch as ye are manifestly declar∣ed to be the epistle of Christ, ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshly tables of the heart. 2 Cor. iii. 1—3. Epistles of commendation, of members and ministers, to those
<PB N="25" REF="024062_0023_0FC2FDB44FE51F50"/>who knew them not before, is a practice establish∣ed by reason and revelation; but the conversion of souls, by the preaching of any man, is a greater commendation of the preacher, than external mi∣racles upon the bodies of any men can be. For the turning fornicators unto a chaste way of living; idolaters to the worship of the living God; thieves, the covetous, drunkards, revilers, and extortioners, into the ways of honesty, liberality, temperance, and true benevolence, recommends the instruments of such a glorious change, more than any letters written with ink and pen can do. Therefore Paul said, <HI>The seal of mine apostleship are ye in the Lord.</HI> 1 Cor. vi. 8—11. ix. 2. How vain then is the above objection?</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Many have objected against our doc∣trine, as that which would invalidate human learn∣ing, and the benefit of a liberal education; which they have called, <HI>A river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God.</HI> But if we attend to the same sacred writer, from whom they have taken these words, he will condemn their scheme. For he says, Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and in his law doth he meditate day and night. And he shall be like a tree planted by the <HI>rivers of water,</HI> that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also shall not wither, and whatsoever he doth shall pros∣per. Psalm i. 1—3. xlvi. 4. Such men <HI>trust in the Lord.</HI> But there is a <HI>curse of blindness,</HI> upon all men who <HI>make flesh their arm.</HI> Jer. xvii. 5—8. Therefore our Lord says, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall
<PB N="26" REF="024062_0024_0FC2FDB5E1FDA130"/>flow <HI>rivers of living water.</HI> John vii. 37, 38. O what blindness then have all teachers who put hu∣man learning in the place of DIVINE REVELATION! For none are truly <HI>learned,</HI> but they who are <HI>taught of God.</HI> John vi. 44, 45. Others are ever <HI>learning,</HI> and never able to come to the <HI>knowledge of the truth.</HI> 2 Tim. iii. 7. And such men <HI>wrest the scriptures</HI> unto their own destruction. 2 Peter iii. 16. So God said of the church of Israel, Her princes within her are roaring <HI>lions;</HI> her judges are even∣ing <HI>wolves,</HI> they gnaw not the bones till the mor∣row. Her prophets are light and treacherous per∣sons; her priests have polluted the sanctuary, they have <HI>done violence to the law.</HI> Zeph. iii. 3, 4. And national churches in latter ages, have done the like through the world. But an inspired apostle says, What man knoweth the things of a man, save the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God. Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is of God; that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things also we speak, not in the words which man's wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. 1 Cor. ii. 11—13. The <HI>words</HI> of scrip∣ture were given by the Spirit of God, who gives us a most solemn warning against adding to, or taking therefrom. And I believe that the <HI>book of life,</HI> means the holy scriptures. Rev. xxii. 18, 19. For Moses says, Set your hearts unto all the <HI>words</HI> which I testify among you this day; which ye shall command your children to observe, to do all the <HI>words</HI> of this law: for it is not a vain thing for you, because it is <HI>your life.</HI> Deut. xxxii. 46, 47. And Christ says, <HI>The words that I speak unto you,
<PB N="27" REF="024062_0025_0FC2FDB74D4F0F08"/>they are Spirit, and they are life.</HI>—He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not <HI>my words,</HI> hath one that judgeth him: the <HI>word</HI> that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. John vi. 63. xii. 48. So Paul says, God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to <HI>my gospel— Circumcision is that of the heart, in the spirit, and not in the letter, whose praise is not of men, but of God.</HI> Rom. ii. 16, 29. Beware of <HI>dogs,</HI> beware of evil workers, beware of the <HI>concision. For we are the circumcision, which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh.</HI> Phil. iii. 2, 3. And there is not a <HI>word</HI> in all the Bible, for bringing any one person into the church of Christ, without a <HI>personal</HI> confession of faith in him. And this may help us in answering</P>
<P>A <HI>sixth</HI> objection against the necessity of an in∣ternal call, by the Spirit of God, to preach his gospel; which is, That many <HI>enthusiasts,</HI> and de∣luded persons have held to such an internal call; but none of the great reformers, nor of the fathers of this country, ever held to any such thing. An∣swer, The example of ancient reformers, and of their good fathers, hath been the plea of all men when it would suit their designs; but when it did not please them, they were ready to exclaim against old traditions, and to follow their own inventions. Though, if the reformers in Germany, and the fa∣thers of New-England, had not been moved by the Spirit of God, independent of all the powers of Europe, they could never have accomplished the great work of reformation in either country. Nei∣ther did the reformers in Germany, nor our fathers in this land, hold to an external succession of minis∣terial power from the church of Rome. But the church of England held theirs from thence; and
<PB N="28" REF="024062_0026_0FC2FDC3CEC3C130"/>they have now carried deceit and cruelty as far as any power upon earth, as America and the East-Indies have fully experienced. And the fathers of Plymouth colony, the first in New-England, held to an internal call to preach the gospel, and reject∣ed external force to support religious ministers, until the year 1658. And the next year two men were hanged at Boston, whose <HI>blood</HI> hath caused loud exclamations against our country ever since. Though it is a most wicked thing for any to censure our whole country, for the evils which were pro∣duced by a practice which our first fathers abhor∣red. A practice which came from Rome, through England to America. And it is impossible for any men to use force with others about the worship of God, without injuring all those who dissent from them. And though, while God was the only lawgiver for the church of Israel, he re∣quired that all adulterers, idolaters, and blasphem∣ers, should die without mercy; yet he never al∣lowed them to use force in collecting provision for his house, or support for his ministers. Each man was to bring in the tithes and offerings that he re∣quired, as he would desire the blessing of God, and to escape his awful curse. This is fully evident in the twenty-sixth, and twenty-seventh chapters of Deuteronomy. And when they generally neg∣lected his ordinances, after their return from cap∣tivity, God said, Ye are <HI>cursed</HI> with a <HI>curse;</HI> for ye have <HI>robbed</HI> me, even this whole nation. Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a <HI>blessing,</HI> that there shall not be room enough to receive it. Mal. iii. 7—10. At the same time he <HI>cursed the
<PB N="29" REF="024062_0027_0FC2FDC867D08140"/>blessings</HI> of the priests, for being <HI>partial in the law.</HI> Mal. ii. 1—9. And <HI>partiality and hypocrisy,</HI> are the unavoidable consequence of supporting any re∣ligious teachers by force. Therefore it is said, I the Lord love <HI>judgment,</HI> I hate <HI>robbery</HI> for a burnt offering. Isaiah lxi. 1—8. Which words our Lord Christ applies to the gospel day. Luke iv. 18—21. And men who are fond of judging others, while they do not obey the law of equity themselves, he calls <HI>hypocrites, dogs, swine,</HI> and <HI>wolves.</HI> Mat. vii. 1—6, 12, 15. But the ruling party in every coun∣try, have never been willing to think that they were such. To know both <HI>good and evil,</HI> was the dig∣nity and liberty which the serpent promised to our first mother; and all her children are deceived with such flatteries to this day. False ideas of <HI>good,</HI> car∣ry men away from the fountain of all <HI>good;</HI> but all who follow such lying vanities, forsake their own mercies. For Christ is exalted to <HI>give repentance</HI> to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. Acts v. 31. For by grace are ye saved, through <HI>faith;</HI> and that not of yourselves; it is the <HI>gift of God.</HI> Eph. ii. 8. For the Lord God is a sun and shield: the Lord will <HI>give grace and glory:</HI> no good thing will he with∣hold from them that <HI>walk uprightly.</HI> Psalm. lxxxiv. 11. He never promised his blessings to any, but in the way of truth and uprightness; and all who walk in that way, receive righteousness and strength from Christ, as a free <HI>gift of grace,</HI> and not for any good in them, or done by them. For God says, There is none that <HI>doth good, no not one.</HI> And he says this of <HI>all the world.</HI> Rom. iii. 12, 19. Yea, of <HI>the whole world.</HI> 1 John v. 19. Rev. xii. 9. And this may lead us to take notice of some capi∣tal MARKS, whereby the ministers of Christ may be known from all deceivers.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="30" REF="024062_0028_0FC2FDCF29F833A0"/>
1. True ministers of Christ, <HI>preach the word of God in simplicity and godly sincerity.</HI> Hence one of them said, We are not as many, who <HI>corrupt the word of God;</HI> but as of <HI>sincerity,</HI> as of God, in the fight of God speak we in Christ.—We have renoun∣ced the hidden things of <HI>dishonesty,</HI> not walking in <HI>craftiness,</HI> nor handling the word of God <HI>deceitful∣ly,</HI> but by manifestation of the <HI>truth,</HI> commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.—I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a <HI>chaste virgin to Christ.</HI> But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve, through his <HI>subtilty,</HI> so your mind should be cor∣rupted from the <HI>simplicity</HI> that is in Christ. 2 Cor. i. 12. ii. 17. iv. 1, 2. xi. 2, 3. Another says, My little children, let us not love in word, neither in tongue, but in deed, and in <HI>truth.</HI> And hereby we know that we are of the <HI>truth,</HI> and shall assure our hearts before him. For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God. And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his sight. And this is his com∣mandment, that we should believe on the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave us commandment. And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he in him; and hereby we know that he abideth in us, <HI>by the Spirit which he hath given us.</HI>—Ye are of God, lit∣tle children, and have overcome them; because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the <HI>world.</HI> They are of the <HI>world;</HI> therefore speak they of the <HI>world,</HI> and the <HI>world</HI> heareth them. 1 John iii. 18—24. iv. 1—5. This is the exact
<PB N="31" REF="024062_0029_0FC2FDD0ACAB9F88"/>difference between the ministers of Christ, and the ministers of Antichrist. But by <HI>confounding</HI> church and world together, which is <HI>Babylon,</HI> men have filled the world with hypocrisy and tyranny, under religious pretences. So an ancient prophet says, They break in pieces thy people, O Lord, and afflict thine heritage. They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the fatherless. Yet they say, The Lord shall not see; neither shall the God of Jacob regard it.—Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which frameth mischief by a law? Psalm xciv. 5—7, 20. And from such thrones, and such laws, have come all the <HI>force</HI> that was ever used to support religious teachers; and in Babylon will be found the <HI>blood</HI> of prophets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth. Rev. xviii. 24. But God hath promised to destroy the face of the covering cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all nations; and he says, In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah, We have a strong city; sal∣vation will God appoint for walls and for bulwarks. Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in. Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee; because he trusteth in thee. Trust ye in the Lord forever; for in the Lord Jehovah is everlasting strength. For he bringeth down them that dwell on high, the lofty city he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust. The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy. Isaiah xxv. 6, 7. xxvi. 1—6.</P>
<P>How exactly does this prophecy describe the difference between the church of Christ, and all national churches in the world? For none have a
<PB N="32" REF="024062_0030_0FC2FDDE23945A48"/>right in the church of Christ, but <HI>righteous</HI> persons, who <HI>keep the truth.</HI> They receive the perfect righ∣teousness of Christ as a <HI>free gift,</HI> and so are <HI>made righteous by the obedience of One;</HI> as we were all <HI>made sinners by the disobedience of one:</HI> only we were made sinners <HI>by the law,</HI> but are made righteous <HI>by grace, abundance of grace.</HI> Rom. v. 12—19. For the <HI>wages</HI> of sin is death; but the <HI>gift</HI> of God is eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Rom. vi. 23. For the <HI>law</HI> was given by Moses, but <HI>grace and truth</HI> came by Jesus Christ. And he said, To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that I should bear witness unto the <HI>truth.</HI> Every one that is of the <HI>truth,</HI> heareth my voice. John i. 17. xviii. 37. And says God to his children, I have not written unto you because ye know not the <HI>truth;</HI> but because ye know it, and that <HI>no lie is of the truth.</HI> 1 John ii. 21. The devil is the father of <HI>lies,</HI> and he se∣duced Eve into the opinion that the penalty of the law of God was not <HI>truth.</HI> But by suffering that penalty, Christ bear witness unto the <HI>truth,</HI> and bruised the head of the serpent. This he did, that God might be <HI>just,</HI> and the <HI>justifier</HI> of him which believeth in Jesus. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what law? of works? Nay; but by the law of faith. Rom. iii. 24—27. The dif∣ference between <HI>debt,</HI> and a <HI>gift,</HI> is as plain as any idea in the world. <HI>Justice</HI> requires the payment of <HI>debts;</HI> but <HI>gifts</HI> are bestowed on whom the giver pleaseth. And salvation is appointed for walls and for bulwarks around the righteous nation, who keep the truth. And God says, With the heart man believeth unto <HI>righteousness,</HI> and with the mouth confession is made unto <HI>salvation.</HI> Rom. x. 10. This is the only way into his church,
<PB N="33" REF="024062_0031_0FC2FDE07523C280"/>which God hath appointed. But many put <HI>moral sincerity,</HI> in the room of <HI>godly sincerity,</HI> in building churches; and hereby cruel <HI>persecutors</HI> are intro∣duced. For our Lord says, The time cometh, that whosoever killeth you, will think he doth God ser∣vice. John xvi. 2. And Paul says, I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contra∣ry to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Acts xxvi. 9. But I obtained mercy, because I did it <HI>ignorantly,</HI> in unbelief. 1 Tim. i. 13. All men who sin <HI>pre∣sumptuously,</HI> or <HI>wilfully</HI> against the <HI>Spirit of grace,</HI> never had any <HI>atonement</HI> proclaimed for them. 2 Peter ii. 10. Heb. x. 26—29. Numb. xv. 30. Therefore the apostle John says, If any man see a brother sin a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not unto death. There is a sin unto death; I do not say, that ye shall pray for it. All unrighteous∣ness is sin; and there is a sin not unto death. We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one toucheth him not. 1 John v. 16—18. How dangerous then is it, for any to receive any into the church without evidence of their being born of God? For they who have only <HI>a form of godliness,</HI> while they <HI>resist the truth,</HI> are <HI>reprobate</HI> concerning the faith. 2 Tim. iii. 5—8. If Jesus Christ is not in them, they are <HI>reprobates.</HI> 2 Cor. xiii. 2—6. They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him, being abomi∣nable, and disobedient, and unto every good work <HI>reprobate.</HI> Titus i. 16. The word signifies <HI>adul∣terate</HI> or <HI>counterfeit.</HI> Jer. vi. 30. Yet many now insist upon it, that we cannot believe that God <HI>elected</HI> a certain number of men, to holiness and eternal happiness, without <HI>reprobating</HI> all the rest.
<PB N="34" REF="024062_0032_0FC2FDE7CE49DA28"/>But who ever thought that a government could not make <HI>good money,</HI> without making <HI>counterfeit</HI> also! or who will say, that <HI>grace,</HI> shown by go∣vernment, is inconsistent with <HI>vengeance</HI> on rebels! Such men deny the only Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ, who <HI>destroys</HI> impenitent unbelievers. They defile the flesh, despise dominion, and speak evil of dignities. Jude 4—8.</P>
<P N="2">2. True ministers are <HI>examples to the flock.</HI> Nothing is more pernicious to the souls of men, than the sight of evils in teachers which they con∣demn in the people. Therefore the first of the apostles says to all believers, So is the will of God, that with welldoing ye may put to silence the ig∣norance of foolish men: as free, and not using your liberty for a cloak of maliciousness, but as the servants of God.—For hereunto were ye call∣ed; because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an <HI>example,</HI> that ye should follow his steps: who did no sin, neither was <HI>guile</HI> found in his mouth: who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously: who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, <HI>that we, being dead to sin, should live unto righ∣teousness:</HI> by whose stripes ye were healed. For ye were as sheep going astray, but are now returned unto the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.—The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder—feed the flock of God which is among you—being <HI>ensamples</HI> to the flock. 1 Peter ii. 15—25. v. 1—3. Another says, Shew me thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by my works. James ii. 18. A third says, Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk so, as ye have us for an <HI>ensample.</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="024062_0033_0FC2FDE8ADBD1370"/>(For many walk, of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies of the cross of Christ; whose end is de∣struction, whose God is their belly, and whose glo∣ry is in their shame, who mind earthly things). For our conversation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ; who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able even to subdue all things unto himself. Phil. iii. 17—21. Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye withdraw yourselves from every brother that walketh <HI>disorderly,</HI> and not after the tradition which he received of us. For yourselves know how ye ought to <HI>follow us;</HI> for we behaved not ourselves <HI>disorderly</HI> among you, neither did we <HI>eat any man's bread for nought.</HI> 2 Thess. iii. 6—9. If any man be in Christ, he is a <HI>new creature;</HI> old things are past away, behold all things are become new. And all things are of God, who hath reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ, and hath given to us the ministry of recon∣ciliation. 2 Cor. v. 17, 18. All <HI>disorderly</HI> persons, who eat the bread of others for nought, are to be excluded from special communion in the church of Christ. And no officers nor members be ad∣mitted but <HI>new creatures.</HI> But who can tell how many teachers there have been, who have called believers <HI>disorderly,</HI> for refusing to yield to their iniquity in eating other men's bread for nought! But God says, Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter. Isaiah v. 20. The world is full of such wickedness.</P>

3. Our Lord is ever <HI>with his faithful ministers.</HI> Lo, I am with you alway, is his promise to all his faithful servants, even unto the end of the world. And he only can direct and support them, in the midst of outward and inward enemies, and make them faithful unto death. Therefore Paul said to Timothy, God hath not given us the spirit of <HI>fear;</HI> but of <HI>power,</HI> and of <HI>love,</HI> and of a sound mind. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner; but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel, according to the <HI>power</HI> of God; who hath saved us, and call∣ed us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us in Christ Jesus, before the world began; but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour Jesus Christ, who hath abolished death, and hath brought life and immor∣tality to light through the gospel. 2 Tim. i. 7—10. The devil said to our first mother, Ye shall not surely die. And ever since she hearkened to him, he hath held her children in bondage through <HI>fear of death;</HI> from which the <HI>death of Christ</HI> is our on∣ly way of deliverance. Heb. ii. 13—18. And God laid this plan of salvation in his Son, before the world began; and no teachers are to be followed, but they who hold that Jesus Christ is <HI>the same</HI> yesterday, and to-day, and forever. Heb. xiii. 7, 8. He is <HI>unchangeable</HI> in the <HI>designs</HI> of his grace, and in his <HI>power</HI> to carry the same into execution. And Paul said, I will come to you, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them which are puffed up, but the <HI>power;</HI> for the kingdom of God is not in word, but in <HI>power.</HI> I Cor. iv. 19, 20. And we are required to turn away from all who deny the <HI>power of godliness.</HI> 2 Tim. iii. 5. And how
<PB N="37" REF="024062_0035_0FC2FDEBDF5627E0"/>full is the world of such! Even of men who deny the <HI>power</HI> of God in changing the heart, and in carrying his children, in the way of holiness unto eternal happiness. The number of the beast is the number of <HI>a man;</HI> and his number is six hundred sixty and six. Rev. xiii. 18. God gave Israel <HI>rest,</HI> in the seventh day, the seventh month, and seventh year. And Jesus says, Come unto me, all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you <HI>rest.</HI> Mat. xi. 28. And our apostle says, We which have believed do enter into <HI>rest.</HI> Heb. iv. 28. But God says, The wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot <HI>rest,</HI> whose waters cast up mire and dirt. Isaiah lvii. 20. Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame. Jude 13. They have <HI>no rest</HI> day nor night, who worship the beast and his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name. Rev. xiv. 11. The inventions of men about the worship of God give <HI>no rest,</HI> in hun∣dreds, in tens, or in units. And this is as true in all who neglect his worship, and pursue the world for safety and happiness, as in any false worship. Therefore our apostle says, Let your conversation be without <HI>covetousness,</HI> and be <HI>content</HI> with such things as ye have; for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. So that we may bold∣ly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me. Heb. xiii. 5, 6. And if he is with every true believer, he surely is with every faithful minister. And the more faithful any soul is, the more they will know of this truth.</P>
<P>Yet two objections have been raised against this mark. One is, that the servants of God, in all ages, have often lamented their case, as unsuccess∣ful in their work, through the hardness and blind∣ness of their hearers. Answer, This is the una∣voidable
<PB N="38" REF="024062_0036_0FC2FDF7A8492028"/>consequence of faithfulness in the cause of God, until his church shall be wholly governed by his laws, independent of the world. For the light of revelation enlarges the capacities of men, beyond any other means in the world; and where men in power have not had the truth of God rooted in their hearts, they have joined with false teachers, in blinding the minds of the people against it, in order to grasp all the honors and profits of the whole community to themselves. So in Israel God said, The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means, and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof. Jer. v. 31. Wo unto you lawyers; for ye have taken away the key of knowledge; ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering, ye hin∣dered. Luke xi. 52. And no such men are suit∣able judges, about the ministers of Christ, but are persecuters of them. And <HI>carelessness, hardness,</HI> and <HI>piercing cruelty,</HI> like the highway, stoney, or thorny ground, is the character that our Lord gives of most hearers of his word; while <HI>understanding, honesty,</HI> and <HI>patience,</HI> in bringing forth good fruit, is the character of all who receive the seed into good ground. Mat. xiii. 14—23. Luke viii. 11—15. And a faithful minister said, We are unto God a sweet savour of Christ; in them that are saved, and in them that perish. To the one we are the sav∣our of death unto death; and to the other the sav∣our of life unto life: and who is sufficient for these things? 2 Cor. ii. 15, 16. A question which none can clearly answer, without faith in Christ, who says, <HI>My grace is sufficient for thee.</HI> 2 Cor. xii. 9. God suffered the magicians of Egypt to deceive Pharaoh, so that he hardened his heart, against the command of God by Moses, to let Israel go and
<PB N="39" REF="024062_0037_0FC2FDFB680404C0"/>serve him. And he says of false teachers under the gospel, As Jannes and Jambres <HI>withstood</HI> Moses, so do these also <HI>resist the truth;</HI> men of corrupt minds, <HI>reprobate</HI> concerning the faith. But they shall pro∣ceed no further; for their folly shall be manifest unto all men, as theirs also was. 2 Tim. iii. 8, 9. And is not this word now fulfilled? For the wis∣dom of the prudent is to <HI>understand</HI> his way; but the <HI>folly of fools is deceit.</HI> Prov. xiv. 8. And how is <HI>deceit</HI> now exposed in Europe and America! <HI>Fear</HI> moved the Egyptians to send Israel away with rich treasures, in the very night that God told Abraham of four hundred and thirty years before. Exod. xii. 29—41. Psalm cv. 37, 38. And if <HI>fear</HI> can do such great things, what will it do when united with the <HI>love of Christ</HI> in the heart? For this union forms the <HI>new creature.</HI> 2 Cor. v. 11—17. Therefore all men who profess the Christian religi∣on, without loving Christ above all creatures, are <HI>deceived.</HI> The other objection against the doctrine of knowing the ministers of Christ by his presence and blessing with them, is the great and boasted suc∣cess of many deceivers. But how little do such ob∣jectors regard the words of our Lord? for he says, <HI>Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles?</HI> Mat. vii. 15—23. A good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is good; and an evil man, out of the evil treasure of his heart, bringeth forth that which is evil; for of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaketh. Luke vi. 45. When a baptized person offered money for power to convey the Holy Ghost to others, by the laying on of his hands, Peter said, <HI>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter; for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.</HI> Acts. viii. 21. His words dis∣covered
<PB N="40" REF="024062_0038_0FC2FDFCED8A7A50"/>that he was a <HI>hypocrite,</HI> and no such have any right in the church of Christ. But most teach∣ers now in the world, despise the idea of enquiring after an inward change of heart, in order for the admission of any into the church, or into the min∣istry. External baptisms, and laying on of hands, without faith in Christ, who hath opened a foun∣tain to wash our souls from sin, and bears away all our guilt, hath filled the church with <HI>briars</HI> and <HI>thorns.</HI> Heb. vi. 1—8. For the sons of Belial sent their servants to the people, saying, Thou shalt give it me now; and if not, <HI>I will take it by force.</HI> 1 Sam. ii. 12, 16. And the sons of Belial shall be all of them as <HI>thorns</HI> thrust away, because they can∣not be taken with hands. 2 Sam. xxiii. 6. And what concord hath Christ with Belial?—Come out from among them, and be ye <HI>separate,</HI> saith the Lord. 2 Cor. vi. 15—17. <HI>Unbelievers</HI> said, <HI>We be not able.</HI> But <HI>believers,</HI> leaving self out of the question, said, <HI>Their defence is departed from them, and the Lord is with us: fear them not.</HI> Num. xiii. 30—33. xiv. 6—9. And in reference to them, God calls us to <HI>hold fast the confidence, and the re∣joicing of the hope firm unto the end;</HI> and not to <HI>harden our hearts,</HI> as those unbelievers did. Heb. iii. 5—11. For they who worship the beast, tread the <HI>holy city</HI> under foot, and say, Who is like unto the beast? who is <HI>able</HI> to make war with him? Rev. xi. 2. xiii. 4. Men who judge for reward, teach for hire, and divine for money, act upon neg∣atives, and say, Is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. Micah iii. 11. But God says, Who hath <HI>required</HI> this at your hand to tread my courts?—Your hands are full of <HI>blood.</HI> Isaiah i. 12, 15. And how much <HI>blood</HI> hath lately been shed in our land?</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="024062_0039_0FC2FE06049B7568"/>
The church of Christ is a <HI>holy city,</HI> which is the <HI>light of the world.</HI> Mat. v. 14—16. But she hath been clothed with sackcloth or <HI>mourning,</HI> ever since the beast arose out of the bottomless pit. She is <HI>one city,</HI> as all the saints make but <HI>one church.</HI> But while on earth they are many <HI>cities,</HI> or <HI>churches.</HI> A city is a corporation, invested with power to govern all within its limits, and to expel all from it, who refuse to submit to their government. And such is the power which Christ gives to every one of his churches, as we have before proved. And he says, The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord hath <HI>anointed</HI> me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are bound: to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to comfort all that <HI>mourn.</HI>—And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the former deso∣lations, they shall repair the <HI>waste cities, the deso∣lations of many generations.</HI> The men who shall do this great work are the <HI>poor in spirit,</HI> the <HI>mourn∣ers,</HI> the <HI>meek,</HI> they who <HI>hunger and thirst after righ∣teousness,</HI> are <HI>merciful, pure in heart, peace-makers,</HI> and <HI>persecuted for righteousness sake.</HI> Mat. v. 3—14. These are the only <HI>judges</HI> in the church of Christ, which will be <HI>light indeed.</HI> For <HI>judgment</HI> will then take place, and <HI>robbery</HI> be excluded from the church of Christ, in the support of his ministers. This is the gospel which he <HI>proclaimed</HI> to sinful men, with <HI>vengeance</HI> upon all who rejected his <HI>proclamation.</HI> Isaiah lxi. 1—8. Luke iv. 18—21. <HI>Offer</HI> of the gospel, instead of the word <HI>proclaim</HI> or <HI>preach,</HI> hath deceived multitudes with a conceit, that it con∣tained privileges which they might now receive,
<PB N="42" REF="024062_0040_0FC2FE0A86F46540"/>or not, as they may any thing which men <HI>offer</HI> to them. Whereas the gospel is a proclamation of grace, which cost Christ his precious <HI>blood;</HI> and he says, <HI>Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</HI> 2 Cor. v. 21. vi. 1, 2. Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip. For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every transgres∣sion and disobedience received a just recompense of reward, how shall we escape if we <HI>neglect so great salvation,</HI> which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him; God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders and divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost, according to his own will? Heb. ii. 1—4. The passover was to be kept without <HI>leaven;</HI> and God said, The man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and <HI>forbeareth</HI> to keep the passover, even that same soul shall be cut off from his people, because he brought not the offering of the Lord in his <HI>appointed season:</HI> that soul shall bear his sin. Exod. xii. 15. Num. ix. 13. <HI>Hypocrisy, malice and wickedness,</HI> is the <HI>leaven</HI> which God commands us to <HI>purge out,</HI> as we would de∣sire to enjoy his presence, and to escape his <HI>judg∣ments,</HI> even sickness and death. Luke xii. 1. 1 Cor. v. 7, 8. xi. 30—32. For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? and if the righ∣teous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? 1 Peter iv. 17, 18.</P>
<P>These are questions which ought to alarm every soul. For all the troubles of the righteous, which they meet with in this world, are because of their
<PB N="43" REF="024062_0041_0FC2FE142B064458"/>own sins, or the iniquity of others; and if they are saved with so much difficulty, where will those ap∣pear who indulge known sin, and neglect known duty, to avoid present trouble? They might as ra∣tionally yield to enemies to escape danger, or drink poison to preserve health. For <HI>deceit</HI> is the <HI>poison of asps.</HI> Rom. iii. 13. And faith in the blood of Christ, is the only remedy against all such poison. His blood will purge the conscience from dead works, to serve the living God. If we say that we have no sin we <HI>deceive</HI> ourselves, and the <HI>truth</HI> is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is <HI>faithful</HI> and <HI>just</HI> to forgive our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1 John i. 8, 9. And how far is each one from <HI>honesty,</HI> who will not confess his sins to God? And how great is the privilege for it un∣der the gospel? Under the law, none might be priests but the lawful seed of Aaron; but under the gospel, every penitent believer is made a king and a priest unto God. Rev. i. 5, 6. And it is a most pernicious delusion, for any man to think he can be a priest unto God, without faith in the blood of Christ, and a life of devotedness to his service. But all who are thus devoted to him, are both kings and priests; and the government of the church of Christ belongs to them, <HI>independent</HI> of all the world besides. Therefore no man can be safely received as a religious teacher, who is not a member of some particular church, who can cen∣sure and exclude him, if he breaks any of the laws of Christ. For Christ plainly commended the church of Ephesus for so doing; and Paul appeal∣ed to the church of Corinth, against <HI>deceitful teach∣ers.</HI> 2 Cor. xi. 13. xiii. 1—3. And who will dare to claim a power above Christ and his apostles! For if the church had not been asleep, iniquity
<PB N="44" REF="024062_0042_0FC2FE181D644AC0"/>could not have prevailed as it hath done. But our apostle says, It is high time to <HI>awake out of sleep;</HI> for now is our salvation nearer than when we be∣lieved. The night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. Let us walk <HI>honestly</HI> as in the day; not in rioting and drunk∣enness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying. But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to ful∣fil the lusts thereof. Rom. xiii. 11—14. If he were truly obeyed, glory would soon dwell in our land.</P>
