<L>Jack Ratlin was the ablest seaman,</L>
<L>None like him could hand, reef, or steer:</L>
<L>No dang'rous toil, but he'd encounter</L>
<L>With skill, and in contempt of fear.</L>
<L>In fight a lion,—the battle ended,</L>
<L>Meek as the bleating lamb he'd prove;</L>
<L>Thus Jack had manners, courage merit,</L>
<L>Yet did he sigh,—and all for love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The song, the jest, the flowing liquor,</L>
<L>For none of these had Jack's regard:</L>
<L>He, while his messmates were carousing,</L>
<L>High sitting on his pending yard,</L>
<L>Would think upon his fair one's beauties,</L>
<L>Swear never from such charms to rove;</L>
<L>That truly he'd adore them living,</L>
<L>And, dying, sigh—to end his love.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The same express the crew commanded</L>
<L>Once more to view their native land,</L>
<L>Among the rest brought Jack some tidings;</L>
<L>Would it had been his love's fair hand!</L>
<L>Oh! Fate! her death defac'd the letter—</L>
<L>Instant his pulse forgot to move!</L>
<L>With quiv'ring lips, and eyes uplifted,</L>

<L>I grant the best blessings we know</L>

<L>Thus riches and health are a bubble,</L>
<L>Thus there's nothing delightful but care,</L>
