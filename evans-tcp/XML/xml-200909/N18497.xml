<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<HEAD>ADDRESS.</HEAD>
<P>THE external name of Free Mason does not entitle man to usurp any authority, or claim any respect from his fellow, without he strictly conforms to the salutary laws and restric∣tions, on which our mystery is founded. There∣fore, I would advise the young and unexpe∣rienced brother, that he be very circumspect; for "by the fruit the tree is known."—The er∣rors you may accidentally fall into by an involun∣tary mistake, rectisy them with that prudence becoming a Mason. Would you wish to be es∣teemed by the good and worthy, be prudent in your words and actions, let it ever be your ulti∣mate view, to add respect to the venerable and noble order, of which you have the honour of being a Member; which will not only disarm malevolence of its sting, but gain you that love and respect which is due to merit.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="section">
<PB N="6" REF="023996_0005_0FC2F02C0F51B120"/>
<HEAD>PRUDENTIALS.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. In all your actions whether public or pri∣vate, be prudent as becometh a Mason; con∣sider in your public character, that the eye of the world is upon you, and the partial tongue of the envious is liable to censure the most vir∣tuous endeavours; much more so, should you, as a Mason, forget your duty, and give any plau∣sable reason, by being guilty of the least irregu∣lar step in your conduct.</P>
<P N="2">2d. In your more private connections, <HI>re∣member</HI> your thoughts are exposed to the all∣seeing eye of the great Architect of the Universe; therefore, prudently consider, that great and comprehensive Masonic command, laid down in our spiritual Tressel-Board,
<Q><L><HI>"As ye would that men should do unto you,</HI></L>
<L><HI>"Do ye even so to them."</HI></L></Q></P>
<P N="3">3d. It is indispensably your duty to check every appearance of vice; for where its baneful influence takes impression on human nature, its effects are terrible. It draws a gloom over every shining virtue, prevents its growth, and steals into the deepest recesses of the heart, and infects every thing within its reach; and produces pride, malice, revenge, discord, &amp;c. &amp;c. Such e∣pidemic disorders are diametically opposite to our noble institution, and must be guarded against in particular; they must have no place of resi∣dence—no, not even a name in the breast, es∣pecially when made the repository of our grand Mystery.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Prudence observes, that a man given to intemperance is no way fitting for a member of
<PB N="7" REF="023996_0006_0FC2F034F7A9E0C0"/>any laudable society; for he values neither health, wealth, friends, family, reputation or character: But temperance is one of the prin∣cipal ornaments of our venerable institution.— Therefore, as you prize your character as a Ma∣son, be temperate in all things.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Prudence informs us, that Charity, or universal love, is a peculiar virtue, and grows on∣ly in the breast of the benevolent, and is the grand corner stone of our order. It unites us in one universal band of affection—conciliates true friendship, and effectuates the great and noble purpose of making each other happy, and re∣joicing in each others felicity.</P>
<P N="6">6th. Would you wish to gain esteem and re∣spect be temperate, be frugal, generous, bene∣volent, humane, sincere and kind to all men; this is indispensably your duty, would you wish to support the character of a Free Mason. Pru∣dence says, the prevalency of good example is great; and no language so expressive as a con∣sistent life and conversation; these once forfeit∣ed in a masonic character, will diminish the man in the eye of the worthy, and give a full scope to the envious part of mankind to censure our noble and honorable institution.</P>
<P N="7">7th. True brotherly love is essentially necessa∣ry to attain to any degree of perfection in the Ma∣sonic Art (as it is the life and essence of all other virtues) your cultivating it, and showing its in∣fluence in your life and actions, will testify to the world, the goodness of your respectable or∣der, and the tongue of the envious and malevo∣lent will be struck dumb, and slander disarmed of its venemous sting. Cultivating brotherly love
<PB N="8" REF="023996_0007_0FC2F0367B8AEB80"/>with laudable emulation, endeavouring to ex∣cel each other in whatever in good and praise∣worthy, is what is required of all Free Masons. Be not contented, therefore, with the bare name of a Mason, but walk worthy of that glorious Profession, in constant conformity to its dic∣tates; for he who stiles himself a Mason, and acts contrary to the mild and salutary precepts of our venerable order, is not worthy of being a Member of the same.</P>
<P N="8">8th. Prudence says, Evil-speaking is a mirror, which shews a bad man's principle in fair co∣lours. As a Mason in particular, shun this per∣nicious practice of back-biting and speaking evil of any man. How easy is it to speak well of any man, if you know it to be so; if you do not, say no ill of him. Be prudent, remem∣ber the royal Psalmist (he says) <HI>"Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, keep thou the door of my lips;"</HI> this detestable vice is the offspring of a diabolical, depraved disposition. A slanderous tongue bites like a serpent, and cuts like a sword. Consider seriously, brethren, should any of us be guilty of censure, or slander (which I hope not) how inconsistent such base proceedings are with the mystical precepts of our institution. Dare any of us as Masons, presume, by one per∣nicious blast of our tongue, at once to ruin our brother or friend's character and reputation, per∣haps to all posterity. Lay your hand on your heart, appeal to that, consider how incompati∣ble with the precepts that were delivered to you as a Mason, to be guilty of such an injury, then shudder at the thought of such baseness, that is so despisable in the eye of man, and so
<PB N="9" REF="023996_0008_0FC2F03847EC9C38"/>contrary to the commands of the great Architect of the Universe.</P>
<P N="9">9th. Prudence advises you, as a man in all your actions and dealing with the world, whe∣ther of a public or a private nature, to <HI>"act on the square"</HI> with all mankind, rendering every man his due. As a Mason, this duty is doubly encreased; prudently consider, how great the violation, should you stoop so low as to forget every sacred tie of Masonry, and wrong your friend and brother, what would be the conse∣quence? You would expose yourself to the tongue of the slanderer, and be despised by all men, and what is worse, forever forfeit the love and respect of every worthy Mason and friend;—therefore let me conjure you, by that sincere masonic love, that I bear to your person and character as a friend and brother, that you forget not the sacred band of union, that ce∣ments and binds us in love and amity together—that you keep in view that grand period of your life, when by the authority of our Order, you became the fellow, friend and brother of the greatest and best of men, throughout the globe. And as long as you act consistent with the salu∣tary rules of Masonry, you will be esteemed and beloved, reverenced and respected,, by every virtuous and worthy man.</P>
<P>Permit me here to add a charge, which, or something similar, you no doubt remember to have been given to you on a solemn occasion—and let me recommend a serious attention to the useful Monitions contained in it.</P>

<HEAD>THE CHARGE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BROTHER,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU are now admitted, by the unanimous consent of our Lodge, a fellow of our most an∣tient and honorable society; antient, as having subsisted from time immemorial, and honorable, as tending in every particular to make the man so, that will be but conformable to its glorious pre∣cepts. The greatest monarchs in all ages, as well of Asia and Africa as of Europe, have been en∣couragers of the royal Art, and many of them have presided as Grand Masters over the Masons in their respective dominions; not thinking it any diminution of their imperial dignities to <HI>level</HI> themselves with their Brethren in Masonry, and to act as they did. The world's Great Architect is our Supreme Master, and the unerring rule he has given us is that by which we work. Religious disputes are never suffered in the Lodge, for, <HI>as Free-Masons,</HI> we only pursue the universal religion of nature. This is the cement which joins men of the most dif∣ferent principles in one sacred band, and brings together those who were the most distant from one another.</P>
<P>THERE are three general heads of duty, which Masons ought always to inculcate, viz. to God, our neighbours, and ourselves. To God, in never mentioning his name but with that re∣verential awe which becomes a creature to bear to his Creator; and to look upon him always as the <HI>summum bonum</HI> which we came into the world to enjoy: And according to that view to
<PB N="11" REF="023996_0010_0FC2F045BB8D6450"/>regulate our pursuits. To our neighbours, in <HI>"acting upon the square,"</HI> or doing as we would be done by. To ourselves, in avoiding all intem∣perance and excesses, whereby we may be led into a behaviour unbecoming our laudable pro∣fession.</P>
<P>IN the state, a Mason is to act as a peaceable and dutiful subject, conforming cheerfully to the government under which he lives; he is to pay a due deference to his superiors, and from his inferiors he is rather to receive honour with some reluctance than to extort it; he is to be a man of benevolence and charity, not sitting down contented while his fellow-creatures (but much more his Brethren) are in want, and it is in his power, without prejudicing himself or family, to relieve them. In the Lodge he is to behave with due decorum, lest the beauty and harmony thereof should be disturbed and broke. He is to be obedient to the Master and presiding officers, and to apply himself closely to the business of Masonry, that he may sooner become a profi∣cient therein, both for his own credit, and for that of the Lodge. He is not to neglect his ne∣cessary avocations for the sake of Masonry, nor to involve himself in quarrels with those who, through ignorance, may speak evil of, or ridicule it. He is to be a lover of the arts and sciences, and to take all opportunities of improving him∣self therein. If he recommends a friend to be made a Mason, he must vouch him to be such as he really believes will conform to the aforesaid duties; lest by his misconduct at any time the Lodge should pass under some evil imputations. Nothing can prove more shocking to all faithful
<PB N="12" REF="023996_0011_0FC2F046F7313238"/>Masons, than to see any of their Brethren pro∣fane, or break through the sacred rules of their Order, and such as can do it, they wish had ne∣ver been admitted.</P>
<P>WHEN assembled within the peaceful walls of our Lodge, where universal love and har∣mony inspires each bosom. When our business is over, then prudence introduces gaiety and good humour, to cheer the mind, and diffuse its pleas∣ing joys over the understanding; then sweet hilarity smiles serene on every countenance, and calls for the cheerful Song.</P>
<P>IN the following Pages the worthy Brother will find a small Collection; which I have selected from different Authors, and which I hope will be well received, and tend to promote harmony and unanimity.</P>

<L>We drove the rude Vandals and Goths off the stage,</L>

<L>The noble five orders compos'd with such art,</L>
<L>Will amaze the fixt eye, and engage the whole heart;</L>
<L>Proportion's sweet harmony gracing the whole,</L>
<L>Gives our work, like the glorious creation, a soul.</L>
