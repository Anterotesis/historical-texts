<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I SEND You the following <HI>Sermon</HI> at your Desire, however unworthy it is to bear the <HI>Name</HI> of your most Reverend and dear BROTHER, whom you have justly lov'd, honour'd and reverenc'd from your <HI>Youth</HI> up; for that singular <HI>Gravity</HI> and <HI>Sanctity</HI> which adorned Him in the sight of all Men; and for that great <HI>Use</HI> which it has pleas'd GOD to make of Him in his <HI>Church</HI> for these last sixty Years.</P>
<P>You are now Your self <HI>old &amp; gray-headed,</HI> tho' You have not attained to the Days of the Years of your BROTHER; and are<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 25, 29.</NOTE> <HI>waiting for the Consolation of a peaceful <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> after Him, as I ought to think of you: And I heartily pray that you may be growing <HI>rich</HI> in Grace, and <HI>ripe</HI> for Glory.</P>
<P>IT is an Honour to your <HI>Posterity</HI> that They have had an UNCLE of such Name and high Esteem in these Churches; and your worthy <HI>Sons,</HI> I am confident, do account Themselves honoured by GOD in the Relation they have flood to Him.</P>
<P><PB REF="003149_0003_0FF0800346D6A7F8"/>
<HI>THOSE things which you have both learned, and received, and heard, and seen in</HI> Him, <HI>do: and the GOD of Peace shall be with You.</HI></P>
<P>AND now I joyn your <HI>Mourning</HI> with the bereaved <HI>Flock</HI> &amp; <HI>Family,</HI> the <HI>Elect Relict and her Children; Whom</HI> (I trust we may say,) <HI>we love in the Truth; Grace be with</HI> Them, <HI>Mercy and Peace.</HI></P>
<P>MAY the blessed <HI>Comforter</HI> be ever near to the Soul of his <HI>aged Handmaid,</HI> the few Days she has to sur∣vive: And may <HI>a double Portion</HI> of the GOOD SPIRIT which rested on the <HI>Deceased,</HI> be inherited by his <HI>honoured Sons;</HI> that in the <HI>Stations</HI> which GOD has allotted them in his <HI>Church</HI> and in the <HI>State,</HI> they may be made great <HI>Blessings</HI> in their Generation.</P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>II. PETER i. 13, 14.</HI></BIBL>
<P>YEA I think it meet as long as I am in this Tabernacle, to stir you up by putting you in Re∣membrance; Knowing that shortly I must put off this my Tabernacle, even as our <HI>LORD JESUS CHRIST</HI> hath showed me.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Death of the aged, holy, vene∣rable, <HI>Apostolical Man of GOD,</HI> SOLOMON STODDARD, for a long course of Years (thro' Grace) the faith∣ful <HI>Pastor</HI> of the Church of CHRIST in <HI>Northampton,</HI> has led me to the <HI>Words</HI> read for the present <HI>Lecture.</HI></P>
<P>I think it but a decent and dutiful Respect to his <HI>Name</HI> and Memory, (giving unto <HI>Free Grace</HI> the Glory of all that He was made to us and did among us) in this <HI>Place</HI> and <HI>Lecture,</HI> upon the first notice of his expected <HI>Decease,</HI> to mourn the common Bereave∣ment of all our Churches. For as he has been for
<PB N="2" REF="003149_0005_0FF0800692B7FA18"/>some Years the most <HI>aged</HI> Minister in the <HI>Province,</HI> so in the Course of a laborious, burning Ministry, he has for many Years shone before us in the Gifts and Graces of the HOLY SPIRIT; a <HI>Prophet</HI> and a <HI>Father</HI> not only to the nei'bouring Churches and Pastors his own <HI>County,</HI> but also to those of the whole <HI>Land.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER those in his own Nei'bourhood, it may be his Name and Ministry were not more dear and honoured any where than in this great <HI>Town,</HI> the Place of his <HI>Birth;</HI> where both Ministers and People receiv'd his <HI>annual Visits</HI> with a pecullar Reverence and Pleasure; as He made them to us (while his bodily Strength con∣tinued for so long a Journey, and this was to near his <HI>Eightieth</HI> Year) with all the Delight and Satisfaction that a FATHER has in visiting the Children of his Love; bringing us the solemn Counsels and Warnings of GOD from Year to Year, which were received by Us in crowded Assemblies, that hung on his Lips, as a People that sought Righteousness and shewed much Love.</P>
<P>THEN it was that this Lecture was <HI>His,</HI> and he was as a PETER here among the Disciples and Ministers of our LORD JESUS; very much our <HI>Primate,</HI> and a <HI>Prince</HI> among us, in an Evangelical and the truly <HI>Apostolical</HI> sense; that is to say, among the <HI>First</HI> for Light and Integrity, for Knowledge and great Judg∣ment, for Faith and Love which is in CHRIST JESUS, and for Zeal and Boldness in the Cause of Truth and Holiness: But I must add, None less affecting a <HI>Pre∣heminence</HI> above his Brethren; none more pleas'd with Retirement, and none more with public Appearances for occasional Services to CHRIST and Souls; none more studious and inquisitive after Truth; none more dili∣gent and laborlous in his Studies; none more lively, fervent and unwearied in the Pulpit; nor did any one love his Work and his <HI>Master</HI> better.</P>
<P>No one in our Churches has run (thro' Grace) a longer, a brighter and a like constant Course of <HI>Preach∣ing,</HI> on LORD's-Days and Lectures, to the finishing
<PB N="3" REF="003149_0006_0FF0800BA6EEFEC8"/>the <HI>eighty fifth</HI> Year of his Life; his LORD giving him a strength of Body equal to that of his Soul, for such a <HI>Run</HI> of Labour and Service; and therein a happy fruitful old Age; his Day and his Work ending together.</P>
<P>AND accordingly, No Minister in the Land liv'd more mindful of <HI>Death,</HI> his own and his People's Death; the first and last Character of a Minister of the <HI>New-Testament,</HI> studions to save Himself and Them that hear him, and watching for Souls as One that must give an Account. And who among Men, for many a Year past, has enjoy'd a more setled <HI>Peace,</HI> and full Assurance of his Interest in CHRIST, than this Servant of the LORD did? whereby he liv'd above the Fear of Death, in a diligent Preparation for it, and in a pleasing Ex∣pectation of it.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE no Minister in the Land, (I am bold to say it) for scores of Years past, could with greater Freedom and Pleasure, Integrity and Truth, have taken to Himself <HI>those Words</HI> of the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> which I have chosen for his <HI>Funeral;</HI> and have said to his Hearers in the Name and Fear of GOD, with all Hu∣mility and Confidence; — "<HI>To You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> have ob∣tained like precious Faith with us, through the Righ∣teousness of GOD, and our Saviour</HI> JESUS CHRIST; — <HI>I will not be negligent to put you always in Re∣membrance, tho' ye know and be established in the Truth: Yea I think it meet as long as I am in this Taber∣nacle, to stir you up by putting you in Remembrance; knowing that shortly I must put off this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, as our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST <HI>hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, I will endeavour that after my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you may be able to have these things always in Remembrance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WORDS</HI> very sutable from a <HI>dying</HI> Minister to <HI>dying</HI> Hearers. Words worthy of a dying <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> New <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be the last Words of</HI> PETER. He speaks of his appreach∣ing <HI>Dissolution;</HI> He speaks of his <HI>Body,</HI> and calls it his <HI>Tabernacle;</HI> He speaks of the <HI>putting</HI> off this his
<PB N="4" REF="003149_0007_0FF0800E6F50B390"/>Tabernacle; he <HI>knew</HI> that he <HI>must</HI> do it and that very <HI>shortly;</HI> He knew it by the Course of <HI>Nature,</HI> for he was now <HI>old;</HI> but he knew it more by what JESUS his <HI>Lord</HI> had <HI>said</HI> to him concerning it: This he ever kept in Mind; this he here calls to Mind, and speaks of it to quicken Himself, and to excite Those to whom he wrote, to a careful and diligent Improvment of the few remain∣ing Days before them, in a Preparation for Death and Eternity.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Truths</HI> that are here presented to us for our present Meditation; and serious Consideration, are these,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THAT the <HI>Body</HI> of Man is the Souls <HI>Taber∣nacle.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THAT <HI>we must shortly put off</HI> this our Tabernacle.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. THAT our LORD JESUS CHRIST <HI>hath shewn us</HI> that we must do so.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. THAT the <HI>Ministers of Christ</HI> must die as well as others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. THAT it is meet for <HI>Them</HI> as long as they are in the Body to <HI>stir up</HI> themselves and their People, <HI>by putting them in Remembrance of these things.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. THE <HI>Body</HI> of Man is the <HI>Tabernacle</HI> of the Soul. <HI>This my Tabernacle.</HI> As our LORD JESUS once pointed to his own sacred Body, and said, <HI>This Temple.</HI> HE was the <HI>true Tabernacle,</HI> which the LORD pitched, and not Man. His human Nature was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for therein the SON OF GOD <HI>tabernacled</HI> with us. — <HI>Our</HI> Bodies are the <HI>small, frail</HI> and <HI>movable</HI> Dwellings of our Souls, of <HI>mean</HI> Materials, <HI>easily</HI> taken down, and to be <HI>taken down</HI> within a <HI>little</HI> time, and to be <HI>set up again</HI> to dwell in. We continue in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but a few days, and we leave but for a few <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to return into them again.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we consider the Body of <HI>Man</HI> in its <HI>original</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <HI>first</HI> State; or if we consider <HI>our</HI> Bodies in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and</HI> Resurrection State; they are <HI>more</HI> than Tabernacles. They were and are in <HI>this</HI> View of them
<PB N="5" REF="003149_0008_0FF08011AEA29940"/>the Building of GOD, a House not made with Hands; made for Perpetuity; for Immortality, never to be taken down; but to be changed, made Spiritual and Incorruptible, and to be taken <HI>up</HI> to GOD, to be a part of his own Mansion and Palace in the heavenly Places.</P>
<P>YET as the Body <HI>now</HI> is, it is wonderfully made, set up and kept up. Call it a <HI>Tabernacle;</HI> it is a sine and noble one in it self; like that of <HI>Moses,</HI> a work of great Design, and whereon much Art and Cost and Care was bestowed. Our Souls could neither provide this <HI>Tent</HI> for themselves; nor can they now uphold, or preserve it from falling, no not a Day. The Soul neither may nor can leave it at it's pleasure, tho' it moves and removes it at it's Will; and often injures it by it's passions.</P>
<P>THE Body should be a Tabernacle for GOD to dwell in; for Him to be worship'd and serv'd in, both here and for ever.</P>
<P>IF there is any thing now <HI>mean</HI> in it, we our selves have brought <HI>that</HI> upon it: We have made it <HI>this Cor∣ruptible</HI> falling thing, which it is now become. It was a fair and beauteous House, as GOD fram'd and finish'd it; and will be so again, when he shall raise it again and restore it.</P>
<P>LET us <HI>thank</HI> GOD for this Dwelling He made it for us, gave it to us, put us into it. Let us give Him the <HI>Glory</HI> of it:<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 5. Psal. xxii. 9. cxxxix. 14.</NOTE> <HI>"A Body hast Thou prepared me. Thou art He that didst take me out of the Womb! I will praise Thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made!"</HI></P>
<P>LET us consecrate the <HI>Tent,</HI> such as it is, to GOD: He will accept the Dedication of it and dwell in it. He
<PB N="6" REF="003149_0009_0FF0801340D4FB70"/>made it for Himself at first, and he now requires us to give it back to Him, to use it for Him and serve Him in it. Let us supplicate Him to sanctify us to Himself, that we may be Holy both in Body and Spirit; and that He may be glorified in both, for they are His, by every Right, of Creation, Redemption and daily Pre∣servation.</P>
<P>BUT while we are in these mortal Bodies, let us esteem them as <HI>no</HI> more than our earthly House and Tabernacle; our meaner and dying Part. Let us daily think of leaving this House of Clay, expect to remove <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> out of it. If we wait a few days, <HI>the Grave is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> House;</HI> and <HI>the Graves are ready for us</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job xvii. 1, 13. Heb, xi. 9, 14.</NOTE>. By Faith let us <HI>sojourn</HI> here as in a strange Land, dwelling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tents, as the <HI>Heirs</HI> of Promise did of old. And con∣tent in our present Lot, let us be seeking a <HI>better Country;</HI> heavenly and everlasting Habitations.</P>
<P>Finally, WHO hurts or <HI>misuses</HI> his own Dwelling? Who is there but takes care of it and <HI>repairs</HI> it? and yet who sets up a <HI>Booth</HI> and thinks of living <HI>long</HI> in it?</P>
<P N="2">II. WE <HI>must shortly put off</HI> this our Tabernacle, and we shou'd <HI>know</HI> that we must do so. The <HI>phrase</HI> here seems not quite so proper: We speak of <HI>putting off</HI> our Cloaths, but of <HI>taking down</HI> a Tabernacle, or of <HI>going out</HI> of it. But so it pleases the HOLY GHOST to blend the <HI>Metaphors,</HI> in my Text and in other places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DEATH is the Souls <HI>putting off</HI> the Body, as a Man puts off his <HI>Clothes</HI> at Night, after the Work of the Day, and lies down to Sleep. So <HI>Aaron</HI>'s putting off his Priestly <HI>Rebes,</HI> was the Figure &amp; Image of his fol∣lowing <HI>Decease.</HI></P>
<P>Again, DEATH is the Souls <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> out of it's Dwelling of Flesh. The Body is no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> habitable; it falls and moulders into dust. As King <HI>Hezekiah</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="003149_0010_0FF08016E85C94A0"/>prayed at the Approach of Death,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. xxxviii. 12.</NOTE> "<HI>My Age is re∣moved as a Shepherds Tent.</HI></P>
<P>SURELY <HI>Jonadah</HI> the Father of the <HI>Rechabites,</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxv. 2.</NOTE> who commanded his Posterity not to build them Houses, but all their Days to dwell in <HI>Tents;</HI> meant thereby to admonish them that their present Life in the <HI>Body</HI> was no other than as in a Tent and <HI>Tabernacle;</HI> and that in the wise Consideration hereof they should piously <HI>pass the Time of their sojourning here in Fear.</HI> And thus the <HI>Rechabites</HI> are an Image unto the Church for ever, of Men spiritually wise for their Souls and a better Life.</P>
<P>IN our <HI>Text</HI> there are <HI>three</HI> things said about our <HI>putting off</HI> our Tabernacle, "that we <HI>must</HI> do it, that we must do it <HI>shortly,</HI> and that we <HI>know</HI> we must do so.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE <HI>must</HI> do it: It is not left to our Choice, <HI>if</HI> we will, or <HI>when,</HI> or <HI>how</HI> it shall be. Death comes with his Commission and Authority from GOD, and says to us, You <HI>must</HI> and shall go. His Call to us is, <HI>Come away!</HI> and with a strong Hand he hales and turns us out. He pulls down the Tabernacle over our heads, and tears the Body in pieces, Psal. 90.3. <HI>Thou turnest Man to Destruction.</HI> 104.29. <HI>Thou takest away their Breath, they die and return to their Dust.</HI> The <HI>Lof∣tiness</HI> of Man is bowed down, and the <HI>Haughtiness</HI> of Man is laid low, in the Day of <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. WE must die <HI>shortly.</HI> How soon or suddenly we know not; but we are sure it will be shortly, "<HI>Are not my Days few?</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Job. x. 20. x<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. 1. Psal. lxxxix 47. Jam. ix. 14.</NOTE> <HI>Remember how short my Time is! How long have I to live?</HI> Are not my Days <HI>as the Day of an Hireling? For what is your Life? it is even as a Vapour, that endureth but a little while, and
<PB N="8" REF="003149_0011_0FF08019DAFB6110"/>then vanishes away.</HI> So the<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Job vii. 9. Psal. xc. 6, Job ix 26. vii. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Cloud</HI> is consumed by the Sun, or the Wind drives it away. So the <HI>Grass</HI> flou∣risheth in the Morning and is cut down at Even. So the <HI>Post</HI> by Land, and the swift <HI>Ships</HI> at Sea, and the <HI>Eagle</HI> in the Air, pass away. And so the Weavers <HI>Shuttls</HI> passes in an Instant thro' the Loom. Next to this is <HI>Nothing</HI> at all; and such is our Age before GOD; Psal. 39.5. <HI>My Age is as nothing before Thee.</HI> Thus the Scripture teaches us to think and speak of the <HI>shortness</HI> of Human Life.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE <HI>know</HI> that it is thus short. <HI>Knowing that I must shortly put off this my Tabernacle.</HI> Who of us but <HI>know</HI> this, in one sense? and yet how <HI>few</HI> of us may there be that know it, in another? and as we all ought to know it? Would to GOD we every one could say like <HI>Peter,</HI> that we <HI>truly</HI> know it! that we seriously consider and realize it every Day we live!</P>
<P>FEW, very few among the dying Children of Men have a <HI>real</HI> Knowledge of <HI>this</HI> plain and common Truth. <HI>The Living know that they shall Die;</HI> but what then? how few among the Living <HI>consider</HI> it, lay it to heart, keep it in mind, and <HI>Live</HI> as if they knew this? This is to <HI>know</HI> and understand in the Language of <HI>Scripture</HI> and of my <HI>Text.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Apostle</HI> liv'd and preach'd, and wrote and wrought according to this Knowledge: and so shall we act if <HI>we understand this and consider our latter End:</HI> While the careless and inconsiderate are the <HI>Ignorant</HI> in the Language of <HI>Scripture, "Who know not, nor under∣stand, but walk on in Darkness,</HI> Psal. 82.5.</P>
<P>IT is the sanctifying Impression of this known Truth upon our Minds and Consciences, and the ruling, Power of it over our Thoughts, Words and Actions, that becomes dying Creatures, who are hastening to an eternal Judgment.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003149_0012_0FF0801CEDCD28A0"/>
THIS is the true and <HI>saving</HI> Knowledge of our own Mortality; which as it is GOD's Work in us and from his enlightning Spirit; so it is <HI>Life Eternal</HI> to us to have this Knowledge of <HI>Death,</HI> this wise &amp; habitual Consideration of our dying State.</P>
<P>WE all <HI>lack</HI> this Wisdom, and we should <HI>ask</HI> it of GOD;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxix. 4.</NOTE> "<HI>Lord make me to know my End and the measure of my Days; that I may know how frail I am.</HI> We must be <HI>made</HI> to know it, we are <HI>hardly</HI> brought to know it, our foolish earthly Hearts are very averse to the serious Consideration of Death and Eternity; to meditate and pray over this Truth, "That we must shortly die.</P>
<P>HE that has learn'd this <HI>first</HI> Lesson, is <HI>taught</HI> of GOD. Psal. 90.12. <HI>So teach us to number our Days, that we may apply our Hearts unto Wisdom.</HI> We can't infuse this spiritual Wisdom into our selves or ours. Yet we may go to GOD for it, who giveth liberally and up∣braideth not. He <HI>wishes</HI> us this understanding Heart, Deut. 32.29. <HI>O that they were wise, that they under∣stood this; that they would consider their latter End!</HI> Let us fall in with this blessed <HI>Wish</HI> of GOD for us, and turn it into a PRAYER to Him; "<HI>O that we were wise, to consider this!</HI> And that we may know <HI>this</HI> savingly, or be left for ever Inexcusable in our Forgetful∣ness and Inconsideration, I come to the <HI>third</HI> Head,</P>
<P N="3">III. THAT <HI>our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST <HI>has shewn us this,</HI> "that we must shortly put off our Tabernacle. Knowing that I must, <HI>even as our</HI> LORD JESUS CHRIST <HI>hath shewed me.</HI></P>
<P>I shall here consider, <HI>first,</HI> the very particular and extraordinary <HI>Revelation</HI> that CHRIST had made to <HI>Peter</HI> respecting the <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of his Death.
<PB N="10" REF="003149_0013_0FF080210696F748"/>To <HI>that</HI> the Apostle refers in my <HI>Text,</HI> namely, to the Words of the risen JESUS to him, John 21.18, 19. <HI>Signifying to him by what Death he should glorify God: That when he should be old he should stretch forth his Hands to be bound for it.</HI> So that the LORD had let him <HI>know</HI> "that he should live to be <HI>old,</HI>" that he should die a <HI>violent</HI> Death, and "that he should <HI>willingly go to his Martyrdom.</HI> And now see in my <HI>Text</HI> the accomplishment of these Things drawing on. The <HI>aged</HI> Apostle speaks his own <HI>Readiness,</HI> Courage and Constancy in his Expecta∣tion of this predicted Death. He was now <HI>old,</HI> and ready to <HI>reach out</HI> his Hands unto them that should <HI>bind</HI> him for Death. <HI>Knowing</HI> (says he) <HI>that I must shortly put off my Tabernacle:</HI> He speaks as one ready and willing to go, whenever the LORD should please.</P>
<P>HERETOFORE <HI>Peter</HI> had not been the most <HI>patient</HI> at the Thot's of Sufferings, and of an ignominous and cruel Death in particular. He of all the Disciples was once the <HI>least likely</HI> to <HI>stretch</HI> forth his hands for another to <HI>gird</HI> him. When CHRIST spake first of his own Crucifixion, <HI>Peter</HI> could not bear it; "LORD (said he) <HI>this shall not be.</HI> When he saw the rude <HI>Guards</HI> lay hold on his LORD, he drew and wounded <HI>Malchus.</HI> When he saw himself like to be <HI>seized</HI> and arraigned, he thrice <HI>denied</HI> CHRIST. These things did not at all look as if he hereafter should be the Man, who when he should be old should go freely, meekly and resignedly to a <HI>Cross</HI> for the Name of CHRIST. Yet CHRIST told him all <HI>this</HI> in the Presence of his Brethren, to put Ho∣nour upon him after his Fall, and to comfort him in his Sorrow for it, and to encourage him in his Self-diffidence, Humility and Fear. And by the Words of my <HI>Text</HI> we see that. He remembers with Pleasure what CHRIST had said to him of putting off his Tabernacle, and was looking out for the Day.</P>
<P>Now it is true that none of <HI>us</HI> have any such par∣ticular Revelation made to us, concerning the Time and Manney of our Death. Never the less it is most
<PB N="11" REF="003149_0014_0FF0802407278718"/>true and certain, as to every one of us, "That CHRIST has many a Time, and in many Ways, shewn to <HI>us</HI> that <HI>we</HI> must shortly put off <HI>our</HI> Tabernacle.</P>
<P>AND as it may be very <HI>profitable</HI> to us to consider this, so it should be a <HI>pleasant</HI> Meditation to us; For every Notice to us of this Nature from the LORD JESUS should be taken <HI>in Love</HI> as it is surely meant. For in the Face of CHRIST crucified, and from the Mouth of CHRIST risen and ascended, we see and hear of Mortality and Death in such a Light and Power, as nothing else can show it in.</P>
<P>BUT How and Wherein has our LORD JESUS shewn <HI>us</HI> that <HI>we</HI> must shortly put off these <HI>our</HI> Ta∣bernacles.</P>
<P>Briefly thus: HE has shewn it to us in the <HI>first A∣dam.</HI> And if he had not shewn us the <HI>Origine</HI> of Death and Evil, it had been yet unknown to us. He has shewn us<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Cor xv. 22. Rom. v. 12.</NOTE>, how <HI>in Adam all die,</HI> how <HI>by one Man sin enter'd into the World and Death by sin, and has passed on all, because all are Sinners.</HI> He that opens the <HI>Book</HI> of GOD and the <HI>Seals</HI> thereof, has in the first <HI>Page</HI> of it open'd to us the <HI>Gates of Death,</HI> and shewn the Beginning and the End thereof<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxxviii. 17. Rev. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Again, THE LORD JESUS has shewn us <HI>in Himself,</HI> in his own <HI>Dying,</HI> that <HI>we</HI> must shortly put off our Tabernacle. With <HI>his dead Body</HI> all his Saints go down to the Dust, and like His their <HI>Flesh rests in Hope</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. xxvi. 19. Psal. xvi. 9.</NOTE>. This is that sight of Death which takes away the <HI>Sting</HI> of it, and delivers from the Fear of <HI>Bondage. Come see the Place where the LORD lay,</HI> and prepare to follow Him thro' the dark Valley, and into the Cham∣bers of Death<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxviii. 6.1 Cor. xv. 56. Heb. ii. 15.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="003149_0015_0FF08025C78078A0"/>
Again, HE (<HI>the Lamb slain from the Foundation of the World</HI>) did from the Beginning show his People that they must die, <HI>in the Sacrifices and Offerings</HI> our of the Flocks and Herds; even from the Day of <HI>Abel.</HI> In the Blood of These <HI>Adam</HI> had the first Sight of Death; and they were <HI>Notices</HI> to him that he himself must die, as well as <HI>Figures</HI> of the Death of CHRIST the great Sacrifice. Thus Man convers'd with <HI>Death</HI> in all the <HI>Worship</HI> that he offer'd to GOD from the Day of his Fall. Death star'd him in the face as often as he came to Gods <HI>Altar,</HI> and the LORD shewed him that he must shortly <HI>die,</HI> in the <HI>bleeding</HI> Figures of his own Death. <HI>Death</HI> was the <HI>Cry</HI> at the Door of the Tabernacle and Temple, in the Blood of the Sacrifices, thro' all the Days of the <HI>Old Testament:</HI> As it is yet in the Churches of CHRIST, and at his <HI>Table,</HI> in the Memo∣rials of his <HI>Death,</HI> thro' the Days of the <HI>New Testament.</HI></P>
<P>IN the <HI>Sacraments</HI> of Christianity, we remember in solemn Form <HI>the Dying of the</HI> LORD JESUS, and are awfully minded of our <HI>own</HI> approching change. The Table of CHRIST, where we show forth His Death till He come, is to <HI>put</HI> us always in Remem∣brance of the present Truth, (as my. <HI>Context</HI> speaks) and to <HI>stir</HI> us up to the Consideration of it, "That within a little time He comes, as to every one of us, and we must shortly appear before Him to give an Ac∣count, how we have remembred <HI>his</HI> Dying, and how <HI>our</HI> own, and got <HI>ready</HI> for his Coming. "Did I not warn you, may the LORD then say, as often as you went to my House and Table, of your dying shortly, and of your appearing before my Judgment Seat? was it not openly <HI>shewn</HI> you in the <HI>Memorials</HI> of my own Death?</P>
<P>THUS again, In every <HI>Sermon</HI> preached to us on the Subject of Death, whether the dying Creature will hear or whether he will forbear, CHRIST sends him Line upon Line concerning his passing hence, to his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Judgment. From Sabbath to Sabbath this harsh <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is grated on, and the unwilling Mortal is made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. O it is CHRIST that speaks to us by his
<PB N="13" REF="003149_0016_0FF08028BB5E93F0"/>Word and Spirit, and shews us that we must die, we know not how soon or suddenly; and what a great thing it is to set our Souls in Order against that dread∣ful Hour! That the second Death may have no power over us! That we may never be hurt of it! That this last Enemy may be slain before us! And that to die may be our Gain, infinite and eternal Gain!</P>
<P>So in all the <HI>Records</HI> of the Death of Saints and Sinners, from the Death of <HI>Adam, Noah, Abra∣ham</HI> and <HI>Moses,</HI> to the Death of <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Iohn,</HI> the LORD has shewn his People, from Generation to Generation, that they must shortly die. <HI>Your Fathers where are they? and the Prophets, do they live for ever?</HI> And who art Thou, O Man! whose <HI>inward Tho't is, that thy House shall continue for ever? and thy Dwelling-place to all Generations?</HI></P>
<P>Moreover, IN the Deaths and <HI>Funerals</HI> of our Re∣lations and Friends, from Week to Week, CHRIST shews us that we also must shortly die. We may see our LORD at every Funeral with the <HI>Keys of Hades</HI> in his Hand<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rev. i▪18. Deut xxxii▪30. John v. 22.</NOTE> He <HI>kills</HI> and he saves <HI>alive;</HI> and none can deliver out of his Hand. <HI>The</HI> FATHER <HI>judges no Man, but has committed</HI> this <HI>Iudgment to the</HI> SON. If <HI>He</HI> will that <HI>Peter</HI> be bound and die, and that <HI>Iohn</HI> tarry till he come; what is it to the rest of the Disciples? <HI>He</HI> also has determined by what Death every Believer shall glorify GOD. The Kingdom of Providence is <HI>His,</HI> and the two great Things in it are <HI>Life</HI> &amp; <HI>Death.</HI></P>
<P>IT is therefore our LORD <HI>IESUS</HI> who shews us we must shortly die, in all those bodily <HI>Infirmities, Pains</HI> &amp; <HI>Sicknesses,</HI> which we feel within ourselves daily, and which are the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of Death upon us; and as we advance in Years the <HI>Shadows</HI> of it lengthen upon us. 'Tis an instructive <HI>Fable</HI> that you have read, "How a certain Man made an Agreement with Death,
<PB N="14" REF="003149_0017_0FF0802DC7631918"/>that he should kindly give him some <HI>Notice</HI> &amp; Warning of his Coming; and when Death afterward came upon him suddenly, the trembling Man pleaded his <HI>Promise;</HI> "Did you not agree to give me Notice of your Coming? Yes, answered the grim <HI>Officer,</HI> and so I did often, but you would not mind me: Did I not at such a Time warn you by such a Faintness? and again at such a Time by such a Pain? and yet again at other Times by these and those Fits of Sickness? These were the kind Notices of my Coming; and now Come away!</P>
<P>BUT in the last place, and in the <HI>best</HI> Sense of all, CHRIST shows unto his <HI>own</HI> Disciples, as he did to <HI>Peter,</HI> that they must shortly put off their Tabernacle, <HI>by the effectual Impressions of his Grace, and by the Teaching of His</HI> SPIRIT. He savingly enlightned <HI>Peter,</HI> and so he doth all his Elect, in the <HI>Truth</HI> before us; whereby they are inclined and made to live in a serious and diligent Preparation for Death, Judgment and Eter∣nity. So he makes them wise for their Souls, wise unto Salvation. He shows them their dying State in a power∣ful and <HI>ruling Light.</HI> This is for CHRIST <HI>to show,</HI> and <HI>for us to know:</HI> As it is written, <HI>All thy Children shall be taught of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>LET our Souls apply to CHRIST by servent Prayer, "<HI>Lord IESUS,</HI> Be Thou my <HI>Teacher</HI> in this great and necessary Lesson! In thy <HI>Light</HI> shew me my mortal dying State.</P>
<P>O let us gladly learn of <HI>Him,</HI> who is the Teacher come from GOD! learn <HI>this</HI> of Him, which is the <HI>End of all Men!</HI> Learn it from his <HI>Word,</HI> learn it from his <HI>Life,</HI> learn it from his <HI>Ministers,</HI> learn it in his <HI>Ordi∣nances,</HI> learn it at his <HI>Table,</HI> where <HI>Death</HI> is set forth evidently before our Eyes; learn it every <HI>Sabbath</HI> and at every <HI>Sacrament,</HI> being early at the <HI>Sepulchre</HI> every LORD's Day; and finally, learn it of the blessed en∣lightning and sanctifying SPIRIT OF CHRIST, for none teacheth like Him, none effectually besides Him.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="003149_0018_0FF0802F7B1FA2A8"/>
YOUR <HI>Ministers</HI> labour to shew you this plainest Truth in a convincing Light: They think it meet, as <HI>Peter</HI> did, as long as you are with them in this Taber∣nacle to <HI>stir</HI> you up, by putting you in Remembrance of it: They would endeavour that after their <HI>Decouse</HI> you may have these things always in Remembrance: To this End the Ordinances of CHRIST are graciously or∣dained, wisely adapted, and to be diligently used: But O my <HI>Brethren,</HI> look off from dying <HI>Ministers,</HI> and look above all present <HI>Means</HI> of Grace, to the crucified risen JESUS at the right Hand of GOD! Look to Him for his HOLY SPIRIT, savingly to show you your dying State, and help you to live in the due Apprehen∣sion of it.</P>
<P>HAPPY the Ministers, &amp; happy the People, who learn this of the FATHER and CHRIST! Let us do it before we die! for there is no Knowledge or Work in the Grave whither we are going.</P>
<P>BUT has the <HI>Lord</HI> JESUS shown us that we must shortly <HI>pus off</HI> these our Tabernacles? So has He also shewn us, That we must <HI>put them on</HI> again<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 15. John v▪28 vi. 39.▪40 41. 1 Cor xv. 20, 23, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>. He has told us, That there shall be a <HI>Resurrection</HI> of the Dead, both of the Just and Unjust; That <HI>all</HI> that are in their Graves shall hear his Voice and come forth; That of all whom the Father has given Him he will lose none, but will <HI>raise</HI> them up at the last Day; That He himself is risen the <HI>Fruit-fruits</HI> of them that sleep; That as in <HI>Adam</HI> all die, so in <HI>Him</HI> they shall be made alive; That this <HI>Corruptible</HI> must put on Incorruption, and this <HI>Mortal</HI> must put on Immortality; and that then shall be bro't pass the saying; "<HI>Death is swal∣lowed up in Victory.</HI> Thus He that has told us of put∣ting <HI>off</HI> the Body, has not <HI>left his holy Ones</HI> in Cor∣ruption, but has <HI>bro't Life and Immortality</HI> to light unto them.</P>

BUT it is time I come to the <HI>Fourth</HI> Head.</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE <HI>Ministers of</HI> CHRIST <HI>know,</HI> and they <HI>ought</HI> to know, it concerns <HI>Them</HI> to know as it does their <HI>Hearers,</HI> and the <HI>Lord</HI> JESUS has shewn to <HI>them</HI> in particular, that <HI>They</HI> as well as others must shortly put off <HI>their</HI> Tabernacles.</P>
<P>IT was PETER, the <HI>Apostle</HI> of JESUS CHRIST, who knew that <HI>He</HI> was soon to die, as his LORD had shewn him. And <HI>every</HI> Minister of CHRIST knows the same thing respecting himself, and should <HI>take</HI> to him∣self these very Words and say, "<HI>I</HI> know that <HI>I</HI> must shortly put off <HI>this my</HI> Tabernacle; my LORD has shewed <HI>me</HI> this.</P>
<P><HI>DEATH</HI> knows <HI>no</HI> Distinction, Degree, Order or Character of Men; has no respect to Persons. But of <HI>all</HI> Orders, that of the sacred <HI>Ministry</HI> should <HI>most</HI> know and consider their Mortal state, and <HI>live</HI> according to the Knowledge of it. — They know no more the Day of their Death than other Men, nor the Manner of it. They are as frail and mouldring Dust, as any of the Lords Congregation. They also are formed out of the <HI>Clay,</HI> and returning into it, tho' they are in GODS <HI>stead</HI> to corruptible Men, bringing the Lords Messages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job xxxiii▪6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IT is meet for dying People to have <HI>dying</HI> Teachers; very meet that they who preach to others of Death and Eternity, be dying Persons, and do it first to Them∣selves; sensible that they are going into the same Grave, and to the same eternal World with their Hearers.</P>
<P>OF all the Prophets, only <HI>Enoch</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> saw not Death. <HI>Aaron</HI> died in the sight of all the Congregation. And we read of <HI>Elisha</HI>'s Death, tho' he inherited a double Portion of the Spirit of <HI>Elias,</HI> His dying too was honour'd with <HI>Miracles</HI> and the Mourning of <HI>Kings</HI> and of the <HI>Schools.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003149_0020_0FF0803429C21BF8"/>
MINISTERS die <HI>Young</HI> like other Men; and in the midst of Usefulness, Labours and Fruitfulness; They live to <HI>old Age</HI> also, are grey in their Lords Work, and worn out in the Service of Souls. Sometimes they <HI>out-live</HI> their Work, and their Powers for Service are <HI>gone</HI> before they put off their Tabernacles. Or they die with all their Powers, vigorous and <HI>active</HI> in them; in the midst of their <HI>Projections</HI> for the Service of CHRIST and Souls: <HI>In that very Day their</HI> princely <HI>Tho'ts perish.</HI> Yea they have died in the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> or been led from it to their dying Bed.</P>
<P>THEY die of the same <HI>Diseases</HI> that others do: of Fevers of Dropsies, by Languishings and Consumptions, or by Apoplexies and sudden Suffocations: They die of Stupors, or Strangury, of dolorous Cancers (and that even in the <HI>Tongue,</HI> as did a late excellent Minister in <HI>London</HI>): They die of noisome and ulcerous Diseases as well as others; their Flesh <HI>broken and become loath-some</HI> before it is put off; their body <HI>vile</HI> to an Eye of sense: They die by evil <HI>Accidents,</HI> as we call em, by broken Bones, by Drowning, by Beasts of Prey; (as the <HI>old Prophet.</HI>) or by the hands of Robbers and Ene∣mies, or by Violence and Injustice under the Name and Form of Law. They are <HI>in trouble as other Men, and plagued like other Men;</HI> and (like <HI>Peter) have Bands in their Death.</HI> — How many of Christs faithful and eminent Ministers have died <HI>Martyrs</HI> for his Name and Truth? Since the Death of <HI>Stephen,</HI> and <HI>Iames</HI> and <HI>Peter.</HI> GOD has (according to his Sovereign Will) <HI>set them forth appointed to Death, a Spectacle to the World, to Angels and Men.</HI> But if they live and die at <HI>Home,</HI> in Ease and on their Beds; die af Age and in Honour, with their Children and Friends about them; beloved, desir'd and pray'd for by their People; and mourn'd for when they can continue no longer, but <HI>go from the Place of the Holy,</HI> This also is like other worthy Worshippers.</P>
<P>MINISTERS <HI>know</HI> all this concerning Themselves, and so do all about them; and it is by no means to <HI>inform</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="003149_0021_0FF08038E8229110"/>but to <HI>affect</HI> my self and you, that I have said so much about it. And to affect our selves the more, Why should I not add, "That Ministers are <HI>Sinners</HI> like other Men, and should be <HI>Examples</HI> to their Flocks of holy Dying, and are but herein <HI>couformed to</HI> CHRIST, like his other Members. Nay are not their Sins <HI>greater</HI> than other Mens? And shall they not then suffer the <HI>Pains</HI> of Death as well as others? Or if CHRIST has <HI>tasted</HI> Death for Them, among the Church of his Elect, shall not they also <HI>drink of his Cup? and be baptised with his Baptism?</HI> And the ra∣ther, if like the <HI>two Brethren</HI> they hope to be <HI>nearer</HI> to Him than Others, in his <HI>Kingdom</HI> and Glory. I say again, Why should they not go before their Flocks in <HI>holy Dying</HI> as well as Living? <HI>To hear about the Dying of the Lord</HI> JESUS while they <HI>live</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 7.</NOTE> and (by his Grace) to exhibit it when they come to <HI>die;</HI> that HE may be <HI>magnified</HI> (and Souls edified) <HI>in their mortal Bedies; Whether it be in Life or Death</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Phil. i. 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FOR these <HI>Reasons</HI> Ministers die, and should die, like other Men. They <HI>know</HI> it, and have nothing to say against it. And they <HI>need</HI> and <HI>ought</HI> to know it practi∣cally, lay it to their Heart and live accordingly; as much, if not more than Others. PETER had the <HI>Primacy</HI> in this respect, among the <HI>Brethren</HI> to whom he wrote; tho' not among the <HI>Apostles.</HI> In this let <HI>Ministers</HI> learn of Him, and be Followers of him, as he was of CHRIST.</P>
<P>WOULD to GOD it could be truly said of all the <HI>Ministers of</HI> JESUS, that <HI>they</HI> have a saving Know∣ledge of <HI>this</HI> plain Truth, which they preach to Them∣selves and Others from day to day! How happy were it for <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Flocks</HI> together! if this <HI>first</HI> and small Principle in the <HI>Oracles</HI> of GOD, known to every <HI>Babe</HI> in the Church, were but indeed fully learn'd by the <HI>Doctors</HI> in it? <HI>Art thou a Master in Israel, and
<PB N="19" REF="003149_0022_0FF0803C33917E08"/>knowest not this?</HI> But O 'tis a great and chief and <HI>first</HI> thing indeed! and happy is <HI>He</HI> that has learn'd it as he ought to know it! It is the Power of GOD unto the Salvation both of <HI>Preacher</HI> and <HI>Hearer.</HI> We may study the <HI>Point,</HI> preach it, and urge it on our Selves and others, and yet not have learn'd it.</P>
<P>BUT who are so <HI>obliged,</HI> bound and advantaged to consider duely of, and live by the Knowledge of their own Mortality, as the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel? Who are more call'd to <HI>converse</HI> with Death, and to look into Eternity than they are? How often are <HI>they</HI> at the sick and dying Beds of People, to the most solemn Ends and Purposes; to minister to their Souls, to enquire into their Spiritual State to assist them and pray over them in the Agonies of Death? and to follow their Remains, among the Mourners, to the Grave!</P>
<P>WHO should know and understand their own Mor∣tality, if not <HI>they</HI> who are so often call'd to <HI>preach</HI> upon the dark and melancholly Subject? and to lead others into the serious Contemplation of it, in all its Weight. Importance and awful Consequence? To whom should the Day of Death and Judgment be more <HI>awful,</HI> or more <HI>joyful</HI> than to the Ministers of Christ? Who have a greater <HI>Account</HI> than they to give? How glorious a <HI>Prophets Reward,</HI> if they find Mercy to be faithful! but how dreadful the great and <HI>terrible Day</HI> to Them, if otherwise!</P>
<P>HOW then ought <HI>Ministers,</HI> above all Men, to know, consider and lay to heart their frail and dying State? the Greatness of their Work, the Shortness of their Time, and the Account they have to give? <HI>They</HI> are the Men, who above any should have Death and Eternity always in their Eye, ever upon their Heart, and be able to say with the Apostle, "<HI>I die Daily!</HI> And who should urge themselves on in their Work with his <HI>Motives</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 31. Heb xiii. 17. 1 Cor. ix. 27. 1 Tim iv. 16.</NOTE>,
<PB N="20" REF="003149_0023_0FF0803EDB3053C0"/><HI>That I may give up my Account with Ioy and not with Grief!</HI> And <HI>lest after I have preached unto Others, I my self should prove the Cast-away!</HI> And again, "<HI>That I may both save my self and them that hear me!</HI> — How should we <HI>feel</HI> the Power and Force of such Words, as they pass thro' our Minds, and come from our Lips?</P>
<P>AND it is to be charitably <HI>supposed</HI> of the Ministers of Religion, that as <HI>many</HI> of them, and far <HI>more</HI> in Pro∣portion of this <HI>Order</HI> than of any other, have the <HI>sa∣ving</HI> Knowledge of the Truth before us; or else <HI>Woe</HI> unto their Souls, and to the Churches of CHRIST for their sakes. This doth in a special manner agree to their holy and spiritual Calling, to their peculiar Bonds and Ordination Vows, and to their high Profession. And this is the Way for them to be blessed by GOD and made successful in their Work: As <HI>Moses</HI> prayed for, and prophesied concerning the Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> and blessed them with his dying Lips; Deut. 33.8. <HI>Let thy Urim and thy Thummim be with thy Holy One.</HI> Which was to say, "Let GOD furnish them with those Gifts and Graces, that Light and Integrity, that Illumination and Sanctification, which are requisite to the faithful Dis∣charge of the Duties of their high and sacred Office. And so <HI>Aaron</HI> was illuminated, living in a Preparation to <HI>undress</HI> and die, at a Day or an <HI>Hours</HI> warning. And this is a shining part in the Character of blessed <HI>Paul;</HI> as he tells the <HI>Corinthians</HI> that by Death working in <HI>him,</HI> Life spiritual and eternal was the more convey'd to <HI>them</HI> thro' his Ministry; he being the more quickned from day to day in serving their Souls, by the daily Views he had of his own Dying: Which I take to be the sense of those Words, 2 Cor. 4.12. <HI>"So then Death <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in us, but Life in you".</HI> For, the more a lively Apprehension of <HI>Death</HI> and Eternity works in the <HI>Ministers of</HI> CHRIST, so much the more like are they to be instrumental to the spiritual <HI>Life</HI> of their People. And who in fact are like laborious, and it may be successful, in their Ministry, as those that live most in the Views of Eternity? As I remember that
<PB N="21" REF="003149_0024_0FF080429A7C1B08"/>the Venerable Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> in his Age, reflected with pleasure on the Goodness of GOD to Him thro' his life, that by a weak and dying state of Body he had been kept studying, praying and preaching like a dying Man for thirty Years together.</P>
<P>O the Comfort and Pleasure to a Minister in <HI>Age,</HI> or to any Christian, that can thus look back on a Life spent in <HI>the Knowledge of Death,</HI> and a diligent Preparation for it. With what Calm and Peace may such a Servant of CHRIST take leave of his Brethren, as the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> did of the <HI>Elders</HI> about <HI>Ephesus? Act.</HI> 20. Yea how <HI>triumphantly</HI> may he speak of and meet his ad∣vancing Change in the Words of the same <HI>Apostle</HI> to <HI>Timothy;</HI> 2. Epist. 4. Chap. 6, 7, 8. <HI>I am ready to be offered, and the Time of my Departure is at hand; I have fought a good Fight, I have finished my Course, I have kept the Faith; Henceforth is laid up for me a Crown of Righteousness, which the righteous Iudge will give me at that Day; and not to me only, but to all</HI> (both Ministers and People) <HI>that love and look for his appearing.</HI></P>
<P>BRETHREN, <HI>Pray for us,</HI> your unworthy Ministers, that for the honour of CHRIST, and the sake of our own and your Souls together, We may be help'd of GOD (and you with us) to live looking into our Graves, and mindful of the things that are unseen and eternal. This is the Way to be labouring Ministers, and fruitful Christians.</P>
<P>LOOK on us, <HI>my Brethren,</HI> as poor frail <HI>dying Preachers,</HI> passing with you into an awful Eternity: And GOD help <HI>Us</HI> to look on You with the same Eye. If there be any <HI>Treasure</HI> put into us, for the Dispensation of the Gospel, it is at best but in a brittle <HI>earthen Vessel,</HI> that will be broken within a few days, and the <HI>Desks</HI> and <HI>Seats</HI> that now know us, shall know us no more.</P>
<P>HOW should we therefore <HI>pray</HI> and <HI>preach</HI> and <HI>hear</HI> as Persons on the Brink of Eternity! And how much

<P>LET us now <HI>every One,</HI> both Speaker and Hearer, lay his hand upon his own Breast, and say to <HI>Himself</HI> in the Presence and Fear of the Great GOD, <HI>"I know that shorthy I must put off this MY Tabernacle!</HI> My LORD has shewed <HI>me</HI> this a thousand times over! But O my <HI>Soul,</HI> Hast thou said it to thy <HI>Self</HI> daily, as becomes thy uncertain and dying State? — It is a very serious and important thing, and I leave it to every ones Conscience.</P>
<P>AND now I seem to have previnted my self, in what I might have design'd to say on the lair <HI>Proposi∣tion,</HI> "That it is <HI>meet</HI> for the Ministers of CHRIST, as <HI>long</HI> as they are in the Body, to <HI>stir up</HI> Themselves and their People, by putting them <HI>in Remembrance</HI> of these Things; and to endeavour that <HI>after their De∣cease</HI> they may have them always in Remembrance.</P>
<P>YOU will please to accept and improve the presen <HI>Discourse,</HI> as meant by the Will of GOD for <HI>this</HI> End.</P>
<P>AND I wish it were at all <HI>Worthy</HI> to bring to your Remembrance, with a deserved Respect and Reverence, the Person and Ministry of that honoured and beloved <HI>Servant</HI> of CHRIST; to whose Memory and your Spi∣ritual Profit it is a small Tribute.</P>
<P>YOU have seen the main <HI>Design</HI> and Scope of his powerful and successful <HI>Ministry,</HI> with the blessed Fruit and <HI>Crown</HI> of it, in the Things that I have said; <HI>What</HI> He reap'd from it himself, and with pleasure saw others reap.</P>
<P>THRO' Grace He was <HI>not negligent</HI> to put all unto whom he came in Remembrance of the great Concerns of their Souls and the eternal World. <HI>As long as he was in this Tabernacle,</HI> (and how <HI>long</HI> was that thro' the Favour of GOD to us how did he <HI>stir up</HI> Himself
<PB N="23" REF="003149_0026_0FF080481F6DCAA8"/>And all that heard him, in his pungent and awakning <HI>Discourses,</HI> as <HI>knowing</HI> that he must shortly give an Account to GOD, and those that heard him, together with him. And now <HI>after</HI> his Decease, <HI>We</HI> should have these things always in Remembrance, as we can bear Witness for him he earnestly endeavour'd, while he was with us and came to us in the Name of the LORD. Let <HI>his Death</HI> bring to our Remembrance, and fix deep in our Hearts all that we have seen and heard, of the Power of Godliness in his teaching Life and Ministry.</P>
<P>As the aged <HI>Apostle</HI> wrote to his Son <HI>Timothy,</HI> so the surviving <HI>Ministry</HI> of the Land may represent the <HI>Deceased</HI> yet speaking to them; <HI>"Thou hast fully known my Doctrine, manner of Life, Purpose, Faith, Long-suffering, Charity, Patience: Continus thou in the things which thou hast learned &amp; hast been assured of.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Crown</HI> of Life is to finish well, in a <HI>happy Death.</HI> And the way to <HI>this</HI> is to pass our Days here under the governing Tho'ts |of Death and <HI>Eternity.</HI></P>
<P>WE must <HI>congratulate</HI> with the wise and faithful Servant that Lives and finishes thus: as the Spectators in the <HI>Olympic Games</HI> shouted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> carried off the Prize.</P>
<P>THE last <HI>Character</HI> of a Gospel Minister is Sanctity and Fidelity in his LORD's Work, in the diligent Im∣provement of many Talents, and the gaining of many more thereby.</P>
<P>THE Gifts and Powers, natural and acquired, of an active Soul in a sound Body, are a rich Endowment; the <HI>Student,</HI> the <HI>Disputant,</HI> the <HI>Casuist,</HI> and the power∣ful <HI>Preacher,</HI> are great and good lines in the pour∣traiture of a compleat <HI>Divine:</HI> But yet these are the <HI>least</HI> part in the <HI>just Character</HI> which the Public has had to day of the <HI>Deceased: "The holy Man of GOD, and the diligent, compassionate and faithful Pastor"</HI> are much bolder and brighter Lines in his heavenly
<PB N="24" REF="003149_0027_0FF0804B73B5E658"/>and angelical Face. So among the worthy <HI>Remains</HI> of his Learning and Ministry in Print, the <HI>Mantle</HI> he has left to us, his<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Which is now again in the Press.</NOTE> <HI>Safety of appearing in the Righ∣teousness of CHRIST</HI> outshines all the rest. By Faith in <HI>that</HI> glorious Righteousness, he has lived and died here below; and in <HI>it</HI> he now appears, in <HI>Safety</HI> and Glory, before the Throne of GOD.</P>
<P>LET the Ministers of CHRIST, elder and younger, now present before the LORD, learn from the holy Life and happy Death of this our <HI>Father,</HI> how to <HI>fulfil</HI> our Ministry. Let us to this End live more than ever in the constant Remembrance of the <HI>Mortality</HI> &amp; <HI>Immor∣tality</HI> of our selves and others. We <HI>need</HI> more than any Men to do so, we are more <HI>obliged</HI> to it than others, we are more <HI>advantaged</HI> for it and <HI>admonished</HI> of it than others; and it may turn to the Salvation of <HI>Many.</HI> It will greatly adorn us, inrich us, and make us useful, yield us <HI>present</HI> Comfort and a far exceeding <HI>eternal Weight of Glory.</HI></P>
<P>AND not only let <HI>elder</HI> Ministers be quickened in their Work by considering <HI>that they must die very shortly;</HI> but <HI>younger</HI> Ministers also should be as much stirred up by the same <HI>Motive,</HI> knowing that They <HI>may</HI> die before their <HI>Elders:</HI> And therefore while they emulate their Gifts, Labours and Usefulness, let them not count upon attaining <HI>the Days of the Years of their Pilgrimage;</HI> but let them <HI>begin</HI> earnestly, that they may make good Proficiency and do much Work in a little Time, supposing their Days should be soon num∣bered and finished by the Sovereign GOD.</P>
<P>YOU have learn'd of the renowned <HI>Elisha,</HI> to look up after our <HI>ascended Fathers,</HI> and cry to their GOD for a double Portion of the same SPIRIT to rest on You, that you may tread in their Steps: And if like Them that are gone before you, you desire to <HI>excel</HI> in Grace,

<P>LET our <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Evangelical Ministry <HI>begin</HI> here, and <HI>go on</HI> with this, in all their <HI>Preparations</HI> for it, and in their solemn <HI>Entrance</HI> on it. Lay this good <HI>Foundation</HI> deep, and build strong for Eternity.</P>
<P><HI>THIS</HI> will make you diligent in your Studies, to give your selves to Reading &amp; Meditation; redeeming your Time: And <HI>this</HI> will make you pray over your Studies, and preach your Sermons first to your selves.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX. <HI>From the</HI> BOSTON Weekly News-Letter: <HI>No. 112</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE><HI>Northampton,</HI><DATE><HI>Feb.</HI> 13. 1728, 9:</DATE></DATELINE></OPENER>
<P>ON the 11th Instant died, and this Day was buried here, the very reverend and aged, our honoured and beloved Pastor, Mr. <HI>Solomon Stoddard;</HI> too eminent a Person to be suffer'd to slip into his Grave in silence.</P>
<P>HE was born at <HI>Boston,</HI> Anno 1643. The eldest Son of <HI>Anthony Stoddard</HI><ABBR>Esq</ABBR>; by his second Wife, who was the Sister of Sir <HI>George Downing.</HI> Had his School Learning at <HI>Cambridge,</HI> under the fa∣mous <HI>Master Corlet.</HI> Took his first Degree at <HI>Har∣vard College</HI> Anno 1662. And was afterwards one of the Fellows of that House. Growing out of Health by reason of too close an Application to his Studies, he was prevail'd on to take a Voyage to <HI>Barbados,</HI> with Governor <HI>Serle</HI> as his Chaplain, where he preach'd to the Dissenters in that Island. But his State of Health growing better, he return'd to his Native Country in about two years.</P>
<P>UPON the Death of the excellent Mr. <HI>Eleazer Mather,</HI> the first Pastor of the Church in this Place, who died when but 35 Years of Age, Mr. <HI>Stoddard</HI> was chosen and invited to succeed him. He was ordain'd to the Pastoral Office over us, Anno 1672; and we have injoy'd an uncommon Bles∣sing in him, for 56 Years together.</P>
<P><PB REF="003149_0030_0FF080532BD28D38"/>
HIS natural Powers were quick and strong, and by the Blessing of GOD on his hard Studies, he was furnish'd with that Learning which is requisite to make a Divine of the first Rank. He was well skill'd in the learned Languages; well vers'd in the religious Controversies that relate either to Points of Doctrine or Church-Government; and was himself a ready and smart <HI>Disputant,</HI> a wise and judicious <HI>Casuist,</HI> whose Advice and Counsel were much sought and valu'd by the perplex'd and scrupulous,</P>
<P>As a <HI>Pastor</HI> he was diligent, laborious, constant; wise, faithful, compassionate. His Sermons were plain and powerful, experimental and spiritual, close and searching, yet rational and argumentative. His Subjects chiefly suited to awaken secure Sinners, direct Souls about the great Work of Conversion, and to help Persons to judge of their spiritual State. And he was favour'd with a more than ordinary Presence of GOD in his Work, and many Seals of his Ministry; in the Course of which there were three remarkable Seasons, in which the Spirit of GOD so mov'd upon the Hearts of his People, that it became almost the general Cry of the Place, <HI>What must I do to be saved?</HI> And Con∣verts were so numerous, as to give a happy Occasion for that admiring Question, <HI>Who are these that flie as a Cloud, and as the Doves to their Windows?</HI></P>
<P>HE was a Man zealous against Sin, a hearty Mourner for the iniquities of the Times, an earnest Pleader with GOD for the Land, the Nation, and His Church in the World.</P>
<P>THE most in the Town have been born &amp; bro't up under his Ministry; and scarce any Minister was more reverenc'd and belov'd by his People.</P>
<P>HIS Station was indeed in a remote Corner of the Land, but his Light and Influence went out thro' the whole Country; and <HI>His</HI> being our Pastor gave a Name and Reputation to the Town.</P>
<P><PB REF="003149_0031_0FF08055810BBEF8"/>
HE us'd for many Years together to make his Annual Visits to <HI>Boston</HI> at the time of the Commencement; and the Day after to preach the <HI>Public Lecture,</HI> to a numerous Audience, expecting and glad to hear him.</P>
<P>HIS Labours and Usefulness were drawn out to an uncommon length. For <HI>fifty</HI> Years, or more, he preached twice every LORD's day; and till his 86th Year (in which he died) he was a constant Preacher one Part of the LORD's-days, and at a monthly-Lecture without the use of Notes at all; and, in the Opinion of some good Judges, so well, that it could not be discern'd his Powers were much abated. And so close did he follow his Studies, even in this advanced Age, that when he died he had a considerable Number of Sermons studied, that were never preach'd.</P>
<P>HE injoy'd a great measure of Health, and was seldom taken off from his beloved Work by Sickness. His Stature was something taller then the common Size, his Countenance comely, his Presence venerable; his whole Look and Behaviour such as gave those who convers'd with him, occasion to say of him, as the Woman of the <HI>Prophet, I perceive that this is a holy Man of God.</HI></P>
<P>THE whole Land has a great Loss in his Death; for such Persons are the <HI>Chariots and Horsemen</HI> of a People, their Glory and Defence.</P>
<P>HE married Mrs. <HI>Mather,</HI> the prudent and pious Relict of his Predecessor, and Daughter of the Reverend Mr. <HI>Warham</HI> of <HI>Windsor,</HI> who now survives him; by whom he was bless'd with many Children, eight of which are living, two Sons, and Six Daughters. His Eldest Son, the Reverend Mr. <HI>Anthony Stoddard,</HI> is now the worthy Pastor of the Church at <HI>Woodberry.</HI> His second Son, Col. <HI>John Stoddard,</HI> is one of the pre∣sent Members of His Majesty's Council. And five of his Daughters are married to worthy Ministers. The Rev. Mr. <HI>Williams</HI> of <HI>Hatfield,</HI> (one of his Sons in Law)
<PB REF="003149_0032_0FF0805A4E910CB8"/>preach'd a Funeral Sermon for him, the day of his Interment.</P>
<P>HE had the Satisfaction for some time before he died, to have his Grandson, Mr. <HI>Jonathan Edwards,</HI> joined with him, to be the Collegue of his Age, and his Suc∣cessor at his Death; for whom we can't wish any thing better, than that the Mantle of <HI>Elijah</HI> may rest upon <HI>Elisha.</HI></P>
