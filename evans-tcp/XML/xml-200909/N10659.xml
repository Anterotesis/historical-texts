<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is great Engagedness, in these Colonies, to cultivate PSALMODY; and I believe it to be the Duty of Christi∣ans to learn the Songs of Zion, accor∣ding to good Method or Rule; but the People ought not to be contented with the outward Form of Singing, but should seek after the <HI>inward</HI> Part:—There are two Parts of Singing as St. Paul informs us, in 1 Cor. 14.15. <HI>(I will sing with the</HI> Spirit, <HI>and I will sing with the</HI> Understanding <HI>also.)</HI> To sing without the Spirit, (though with good Method) is like the Sound of a musical Instrument without Life. To sing with the Spirit, I understand Paul further to mean, to sing with spiritual Matter: And thus when we sing with the Understanding or Method, and with spiritual Matter, by the Influence of God's Spirit, we sing agreeable to God's Mind. St. Paul exhorts, in Col. 3.16. <HI>Let the Word of Christ dwell in you richly in all Wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms and Hymns, and spiritual Songs, singing with Grace in your Hearts to the Lord.</HI> The Songs of Zion, when they are sung with the Spirit of the Gospel, are very comforting, refreshing, and edifying to the Chil∣dren of God—convincing to a carnal Wold—well-pleasing

to God, and destructive to the Kingdom of Satan. And it being a good Work, I am wil∣ling to contribute something towards promoting it. For this End I have taken no small Pains to col∣lect a Number of choice Hymns, Psalms, and spiritual Songs, from a Number of Authors of dif∣ferent Denominations of Christians, that every Christian may be suited. I have, in the first Place, chose out some awakening and most alarm∣ing Hymns, next to them penitential, then invi∣ting, and then consolating Hymns, and the last Part contains Hymns of the Birth, Death, Resur∣rection and Ascension of Christ, and his Appea∣rance in the last Great Day. These Hymns are in various Metres, and especially the last Part are of uncommon Measures, for new Tunes and new Singers.</P>
<P>Here I present you, O Christians, of what De∣nomination soever, with cordial Hymns, to com∣fort you in your weary Pilgrimage; I hope they will assist and strengthen you through the various Changes of this Life, till you shall all safely arrive to the general Assembly Above, and Church of the First-Born, where you shall have no more need of these imperfect Hymns; but shall per∣fectly join the Songs of Moses and the Lamb; where all your imperfect Services shall forever be at an End; and you shall have open and full Vision and Fruition of GOD and the LAMB; where you shall sit down in perfect Harmony with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, and with all the Saints and Angels in the New-Jerusalem; where all Sorrow, Grief, Trouble and Pain shall forever cease, and all Tears wiped away from your Eyes.</P>

<HEAD><HI>The UNKNOWN WORLD.</HI> Verses occasioned by hearing a Pass-Bell.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HARK! my gay friend, that solemn toll</L>
<L>Speaks the departure of a soul!</L>
<L>'Tis gone, that's all we know—not where,</L>
<L>Or how th' unbody'd soul does fare,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In that mysterious world none knows</L>
<L>But God alone, to whom it goes;</L>
<L>To whom departed souls return,</L>
<L>To take their doom, to smile or mourn.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! by what glimm'ring light we view</L>
<L>The unknown World we're hast'ning to!</L>
<L>God has lock'd up the mystic page,</L>
<L>And curtain'd darkness round the stage!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wise heav'n to render search perplext,</L>
<L>Has drawn 'twixt this world and the next</L>
<L>A dark impenetrable screen,</L>
<L>All behind which is yet unseen!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We talk of heav'n, we talk of hell;</L>
<L>But what they mean, no tongue can tell!</L>
<L>Heav'n is the realm where angels are,</L>
<L>And hell the <HI>chaos</HI> of despair!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what these awful words imply,</L>
<L>None of us know until we die!</L>
<L>Whether we will or no we must</L>
<L>Take the succeeding world on trust.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>This hour perhaps our friend is well;</L>
<L>Death struck the next, he cries Farewell!</L>
<L>I die!—and then, for ought we see,</L>
<L>Ceases at once to breathe and be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus launch'd from life's ambiguous shore,</L>
<L>Ingulph'd in death, appears no more,</L>
<L>Then undirected to repair</L>
<L>To distant worlds we know not where.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="119" REF="013507_0118_0F90A311E88759D8"/>
<L>Swift flies the soul, perhaps 'tis gone▪</L>
<L>A thousand leagues beyond the sun;</L>
<L>Or twice ten thousand more thrice told,</L>
<L>Ere the forsaken clay is cold!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet who knows, if friends we lov'd,</L>
<L>Though dead, may be so far remov'd;</L>
<L>Only this vail of flesh between,</L>
<L>Perhaps they watch us tho' unseen.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whilst we, their loss lamenting say,</L>
<L>They're out of hearing, far away;</L>
<L>Guardians to us perhaps they're near,</L>
<L>Conceal'd in vehicles of air.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And yet no notices they give,</L>
<L>Nor tell us where or how they live,</L>
<L>Though conscious, whilst with us below,</L>
<L>How much themselves desir'd to know:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As if bound up by solemn fate,</L>
<L>To keep this <HI>secret</HI> of their <HI>state.</HI></L>
<L>To tell their joys or pains to none,</L>
<L>That man might live by faith alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Well, let my Sov'reign, if he please,</L>
<L>Lock up his marvellous decrees;</L>
<L>Why should I wish him to reveal</L>
<L>What he thinks proper to conceal?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It is enough that I believe,</L>
<L>Heav'n's brighter than I can conceive:</L>
<L>And he that makes it all his care</L>
<L>To serve God here, shall see him there!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But oh! what worlds shall I survey,</L>
<L>The moment that I leave this clay?</L>
<L>How sudden the surprise, how new!</L>
<L>Let it, my God, be happy too.</L>
