<HEAD>SONG. THE CHOICE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>I'M told by the wise ones, a maid I will die,</L>
<L>They say I'm too nice, but the charge I deny;</L>
<L>I know but too well how the time flies along,</L>
<L>That we live but few years, and fewer are young;</L>
<L>But I hate to be cheated, and never will buy</L>
<L>Whole ages of sorrow for moments of joy;</L>
<L>I never will wed 'till a youth I can find,</L>
<L>Where the friend and the lover are equally join'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No pedant, tho' learned, or foolishly gay,</L>
<L>Or laughing because he has nothing to say;</L>
<L>To every fair-one obliging and free,</L>
<L>But never be loving to any but me—</L>
<L>In whose tender bosom my soul can confide,</L>
<L>Whose kindness can soothe me, whose counsels can guide,</L>
<L>Such a youth I would marry, if such I could find,</L>
<L>Where the friend and the lover are equally join'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>From such a dear lover as here I describe,</L>
<L>No dangers should fright me, nor millions should bribe;</L>
<L>But until this astonishing creature I know,</L>
<L>I am single and happy, and still will be so;</L>
<L>You may laugh, and suppose I am nicer than wise,</L>
<L>But I'll shun the dull fop, the pert coxcomb despise;</L>
<L>Nor ere will I marry 'till the youth I can find,</L>
<L>Where the friend and the lover are equally join'd.</L>

<L>AS t'other day milking I sat in the vale,</L>

<L>I little thought now he'd his passion advance,</L>

<L>He begg'd a kind kiss, which I gave him I vow,</L>
<L>And I laid my own self, all the fault on the cow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How many ways love can the bosom invade!</L>
<L>His bait prov'd too strong, alas! for a maid:</L>
<L>He hinted that wedlock was what he'd be at,</L>

<HEAD>SONG. PADDY BULL'S EXPEDITION.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHEN I took my departure from Dublin's sweet town,</L>
<L>And for England's ownself thro' the seas I did plow;</L>
<L>For four long days I was toss'd up and down,</L>
<L>Like a quid of chew'd hay in the throat of a cow;</L>
<L>While afraid off the deck in the ocean to slip, sir,</L>
<L>I clung like a cat, fast hold for to keep, sir;</L>
<L>Round about the big post that grows out of the ship, sir,</L>
<L>O I never thought more to sing langolee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Thus standing stock still, all the while I was moving,</L>
<L>Till Irelands coast I saw clean out of sight;</L>
<L>Myself the next day a true Irishman proving,</L>
<L>When leaving the ship on the shore for to light;</L>
<L>As the board they put out was too narrow to quarter,</L>
<L>The first step I took was in such a totter,</L>
<L>That I jump'd upon land, to my neck up in water;</L>
<L>O that was no time to sing langolee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But as sharp cold and hunger I never yet knew more,</L>
<L>And my stomach and bowels did grumble and growl,</L>
<L>I thought the best way to get each in good humour,</L>
<L>Was to take out, the wrinkles of both, by my soul;</L>
<L>So I went to a house where roast meat they provide, sir,</L>
<L>With a whirligig, which up the chimney I spi'd, sir,</L>
<L>And which grinds all their smoak into powder besides, sir—</L>
<L>Tis true as I am now singing langolee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then I went to the landlord of all the stage coaches,</L>
<L>That set sail for London each night of the week,</L>
<L>To whom I obnoxiously made my approaches,</L>
<L>As a birth aboard one I was come for to seek;</L>
<L>But as for the inside, I'd no cash in my casket,</L>
<L>Says I, with your leave, I make bold, Sir, to ask it,</L>
<L>When the coach is gone off, pray what time goes the basket?</L>
<L>For then I can ride and sing langolee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When, making his mouth up—"the basket, says he, sir,</L>
<L>Goes after the coach a full hour or two;"</L>
<L><PB N="22" REF="032901_0022_0FF6768983299200"/>

<L>But the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a word that he told me was true;</L>
<L>For though one went before, and the other behind sir,</L>
<L>They set off cheek by jole at the very same time, sir,</L>
<L>So the same day, at night, I set out by moon-shine, sir,</L>
<L>All alone by myself singing langolee.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>O long life to the moon, for a brave noble creature,</L>
<L>That serves us for lamplight each night in the dark!</L>
<L>While the sun only shines in the day, which, by nature,</L>
<L>Wants no light at all—as you all may remark;</L>
<L>But as for the moon, by my soul I'll be bound, sir,</L>
<L>It would save the whole nation a great many pounds, sir,</L>

<HEAD>SONG. FLOWERS OF EDINBURGH.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MY love was once a bonny lad,</L>
<L>He was the flower of all his kin,</L>
<L>The absence of his bonny face</L>
<L>Has rent my tender heart in swain.</L>
<L>I day nor night find no delight,</L>
<L>In silent tears I still complain;</L>
<L>And exclaim 'gainst those my rival soes,</L>
<L>That ha'e ta'en from me my darling swain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Despair and anguish fills my breast,</L>
<L>Since I have lost my blooming rose;</L>
<L>I sigh and moan while others rest,</L>
<L>His absence yields me no repose.</L>
<L>To seek my lover I'll range and rove,</L>
<L>Thro' ev'ry grove and distant plain;</L>
<L>Thus I'll ne'er cease, but spend my days,</L>
<L>To hear tidings from my darling swain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>There's naething strange in nature's change,</L>
<L>Since parents shew such cruelty;</L>
<L>They caus'd my love from me to range,</L>
<L>And knows not to what destiny,</L>
<L>The pretty kids and tender lambs</L>
<L>May cease to sport upon the plains;</L>
<L>But I'll mourn and lame at in deep discontent</L>
<L>The absence of my darling swain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Kind Neptune, let me thee intreat,</L>
<L>To send a fair and pleasant gale;</L>
<L>Ye dolphins sweet, upon me wait,</L>
<L>And convey me on your tail;</L>
<L>Heavens bless my voyage with success.</L>
<L>While crossing of the raging main,</L>
<L>And send me safe o'er to that distant shore,</L>
<L>To meet my lovely, darling swain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>All joy and mirth at our return</L>
<L>Shall then abound from Tweed to Tay:</L>
<L>The bells shall ring, and sweet birds sing,</L>
<L>To grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd crown our nuptial day.</L>
<L>Thus b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ess'd w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> charms in my love's arms,</L>

<LG>
<L>COME, shepherds, we'll follow the hearse,</L>
<L>And see our lov'd Corydon laid;</L>
<L>Tho' sorrow may blemish the verse,</L>
<L>Yet let the sad tribute be paid.</L>
<L>They call'd him the pride of the plain:</L>
<L>In sooth he was gentle and kind;</L>
<L>He mark'd in his elegant strain,</L>
<L>The graces that glow'd in his mind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On purpose he planted yon trees,</L>
<L>That birds in the covert might dwell;</L>
<L>He culter'd the thyme for the bees,</L>
<L>But never would rifle their cell.</L>
<L>Ye lambkins that play'd at his feet,</L>
<L>Go bleat, and your master bemoan:</L>
<L>His music was artless and sweet,</L>
<L>His manners as mild as your own.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No verdure shall cover the vale,</L>
<L>No bloom on the blossoms appear;</L>
<L>The sweets of the forest shall fail,</L>
<L>And winter discolour the year.</L>
<L>No birds in our hedges shall sing,</L>
<L>(Our hedges so vocal before)</L>
<L>Since he that should welcome the spring,</L>
<L>Can greet the gay season no more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His Phyllis was fond of his praise,</L>
<L>And poets came round in a throng;</L>
<L>They listen'd, and envy'd his lays,</L>
<L>But which of them equall'd his song?</L>
<L>Ye shepherds henceforward be mute,</L>
<L>For lost is the pastoral strain;</L>
<L>So give me my Corydon's flute,</L>
<L>And thus—let me break it in twain.</L>

<LG>
<L>WHEN forc'd from dear Hebe to go,</L>
<L>What anguish I felt at my heart!</L>
<L>And I thought, but it might not be so;</L>
<L>She was sorry to see me depart.</L>
<L>She cast such a languishing view,</L>
<L>My path I could scarcely discern:</L>
<L>So sweetly she bade me adieu!</L>
<L>I thought that she bade me return.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Methought, she might like to retire</L>
<L>To the grove I had labour'd to rear;</L>
<L>For, whatever I heard her admire,</L>
<L>I hasted, and planted it there.</L>
<L>Her voice such a pleasure conveys,</L>
<L>So much I her accents adore;</L>
<L>Let her speak and whatever she says,</L>
<L>I'm sure still to love her the more.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now, ere I haste to the plain,</L>
<L>Come, shepherds, and talk of her ways;</L>
<L>I could lay down my life for the swain</L>
<L>That would sing me a song in her praise.</L>
<L>While he sings, may the maids of the town:</L>
<L>Come flocking, and listen awhile;</L>
<L>Nor on him let Hebe once frown,</L>
<L>But I cannot allow her to smile.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To see, when my charmer goes by,</L>
<L>Some hermit peeps out of his cell,</L>
<L>How he thinks of his youth with a sigh,</L>
<L>How fondly he wishes her well!</L>
<L>On him she may smile, if she please;</L>
<L>'Twill warm the cold bosom of age;—</L>
<L>But cease, gentle, Hebe, Oh, cease!</L>
<L>Such softness will ruin the sage.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I've stole from no flow'rets that glow,</L>

<L>BENEATH a green shade, a lovely young swain,</L>
<L>One ev'ning reclin'd to discover his pain:</L>
<L>So sad, yet so sweetly, he warbled his woe,</L>
<L>The winds ceas'd to breathe and the fountains to flow;</L>
<L>Rude winds, with compassion, could hear him complain,</L>
<L>Yet Chloe, less gentle, was deaf to his strain.</L>

<L>Nor smil'd the fair morning more chearful than they.</L>
<L>Now, scenes of distress please only my sight:</L>
<L>I sicken in pleasure, and languish in light.</L>

<L>Thro' changes, in vain, relief I pursue,</L>

<L>But, see! the pale moon, all clouded, retires!</L>
<L>The breezes grow cool, not Strephon's desires!</L>
<L>I fly from the dangers of tempest and wind:</L>
<L>Yet nourish the madness that preys on my mind.</L>
<L>Ah, wretch! how can life be worthy thy care,</L>

<L>Out of which I will drink to sweet Kate of the vale,</L>
<L>Was once Toby Filpot, a thirsty old soul,</L>
<L>As e'ere drank a bottle, or fathom'd a bowl;</L>
<L>In boozing about 'twas his pride to excel,</L>
<L>And among jolly topers he bore off the bell.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It chanc'd, as in dog-days he sat at his ease,</L>
<L>In his flower-woven arbour, as gay as you please,</L>
<L>With a friend and a pipe, puffing sorrow away,</L>
<L>And with honest old stingo was soaking his clay;</L>
<L>His breath doors of life on a sudden were shut,</L>
<L>And he dy'd full as big as a Dorchester butt.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>His body, when long in the ground it had lain,</L>
<L>And time into clay had dissolv'd it again,</L>
<L>A potter found out, in its covert so sung,</L>
<L>And with part of fat Toby he made this brown jug;</L>
<L>Now sacred to friendship, to mirth and mild <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e</L>

<HEAD>SONG, AGNES AND TOBY: or a SEQUEL TO T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> BROWN JUG.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>MY true hearty fellows, who smoke with such glee,</L>
<L>To beg your attention for once I'll make free;</L>
<L>And sing of our pipes while thus merry and snug,</L>
<L>We lighten our care as we lighten our jug:</L>
<L>This jug which from Toby its origin boasts,</L>
<L>Old Toby, whose mem'ry enlivens our toasts.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Toby's fame, like his size, spread so great by his ale,</L>
<L>That for Agnes no room could be found in the tale;</L>
<L>Honest Agnes, the social support of his life,</L>
<L>Both for quasting and size was well pair'd as his wife,</L>
<L>Therefore singing her praise we with joy will regale,</L>
<L>Whilst our pipes and our jug give a zest to our ale.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The potter who s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rewdly found Toby's semains,</L>
<L>Thought again there to visit might answer his pains,</L>
<L>Where in brief, he found Agnes, whose death as her life,</L>
<L>Made her qualified duly to lye as his wife;</L>
<L>Her fair fame all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ucessantly quote,</L>

</LG>

<L><HI>Agnes Filpot, the wife of old Toby renown'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Who liv'd whilst on earth, now lies dead in this ground;</HI></L>

<L><HI>She soften'd her sorrows with brandy and milk;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Swoln quite silky she thriv'd, 'till her skin gave a crack,</HI></L>
<L><HI>When Death poping in—laid her here on her back.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At these lines our shrewd potter a happy thought started,</L>
<L>That Agnes and Toby should never be parted;</L>
<L>So he took of her clay, which was—white as her milk,</L>
<L>And temper'd with brandy till softer than silk;</L>
<L>And forming these pipes, he advis'd, sly and snug,</L>
<L>That we kiss HER fair clay, and shake hands with HIS jug.</L>

<LG>
<L>To Anacreon, in heav'n where he sat in full glee,</L>
<L>A few sons of harmony sent a petition,</L>
<L>That he their inspirer and patron would be;</L>
<L>When this answer arrived from the jolly old Grecian:</L>
<L>Voice, fiddle and flute,</L>
<L>No longer be mute,</L>
<L>I'll lend you my name and inspire you to boot:</L>
<L>And besides, I'll instruct ye, like me to entwine,</L>
<L>The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine.</L>
</LG>

<L>The uews through Olympus immediately flew,</L>
<L>When old Thunder pretended to give himself airs,</L>
<L>If these mortals are suffer'd their schemes to pursue,</L>
<L>The devil a goddess will stay above stairs.</L>
<L>Hark! already they cry,</L>
<L>In transports of joy,</L>
<L>Away to the sons of Anacreon we'll fly:</L>
<L>And there with good fellows, we'll learn to entwine,</L>
<L>The myrtle of Venus with Bacchus's vine.</L>

<L>The yellow hair'd god, with his nine fusty maids;</L>

<L>And the bi-forked hill a mere desert will be:</L>
<L>My thunder, no fear on't,</L>
<L>Shall soon do its errand,</L>
<L>And dam'me! I'll swinge the ringleaders, I warrant,</L>
<L>I'll trim the young dogs for thus daring to twine</L>

<L>Your thunder is useless, then shewing his laurel,</L>
<L>Cry'd <HI>Sic evitable fulmen</HI> you know!</L>
<L>Then over each head</L>
<L>My laurels I'll spread.</L>
<L>So my sons from your crackers no mischief shall dread,</L>

<L>Cry'd Jove, we relent, since the truth you now tell us,</L>

<HEAD>SONG. THE WOMEN ALL TELL ME.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>THE women all tell me I'm false to my lass;</L>
<L>That I quit my poor Chloe and stick to my glass;</L>
<L>But to you men of reason, my reasons I'll own;</L>
<L>And if you don't like them, why—let them alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Altho' I have left her, the truth I'll declare;</L>
<L>I believe she was good, and I'm sure she was fair;</L>
<L>But goodness and charms in a bumper I see,</L>
<L>That make it as good and as charming as s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Chloe had dimples and smiles, I must own,</L>
<L>But though she could smile, yet, in truth she could frown:</L>
<L>But tell me, ye lovers of liquor divine,</L>
<L>Did you e'er see a frown in a bumper of wine?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her lilies and roses were just in their prime;</L>
<L>Yet lilies and roses are conquer'd by time:</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in wine, from its age, such a benefit flows,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we like it the better, the older it grows.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They tell me my love would in time have been cloy'd,</L>
<L>And that beauty's insipid when once 'tis enjoy'd;</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="032901_0099_0FF73DFD3929ED28"/>
But in wine I both time and enjoyment defy;</L>
<L>For the longer I drink the more thirsty am I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Let murders, and battles, and history prove</L>
<L>The mischiefs that wait upon rivals in love:</L>
<L>But in drinking, thank heaven, no rival contends;</L>
<L>For the more we love liquor, the more we are friends,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She too might have poison'd the joy of my life,</L>
<L>With nurses and babies, and squalling and strife;</L>
<L>But my wine neither nurses nor babies can bring,</L>
<L>And a big-bellied bottle's a mighty good thing.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We shorten our days when with love we engage;</L>
<L>It brings on diseases, and hastens old age:</L>
<L>But wine from grim death can its votaries save.</L>
<L>And keep out t'other leg when there's one in the grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Perhaps like her sex, ever false to her word,</L>
<L>She had left me to get an estate or a lord:</L>
<L>But my bumper (regarding not title or pelf)</L>
<L>Will stand by me when I can't stand by myself.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then, my dear Chloe, no longer complain,</L>
<L>She's rid of her lover, and I of my pain;</L>
<L>For in wine, mighty wine, many comforts I spy:</L>
<L>Should you doubt what I say—take a bumper and try.</L>

<HEAD>SONG. CHOICE OF A WIFE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>GIVE me the nymph who no beauty can boast,</L>
<L>But health and good humour to make her my toast;</L>
<L>If straight, I don't care whether slender or fat,</L>
<L>And six feet or four—well ne'er quarrel for that.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Whate'er her complexion, I vow I don't care:</L>
<L>If brown, it is lasting—more pleasing if fair:</L>
<L>And though in her cheeks, I no dimples should see,</L>
<L>Let her smile—and each dell is a dimple to me.</L>

<PB N="5" REF="032901_0100_0FF73E46AE86B4A0"/>
<L>Let her locks be the reddest that ever was seen:</L>
<L>And her eyes—may be e'en any colour—but green:</L>
<L>For in eyes, though so various in histre and hue,</L>
<L>I swear I've no choice—only let her have two.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Tis true, I'd dispense with a throne on her back;</L>
<L>And white teeth, I own, are genteeler than black:</L>
<L>A little round chin too's a beauty I've heard:</L>
<L>But I only desire—she mayn't have a beard.</L>

<HEAD>NEW GROUP OF LOVERS.</HEAD>
<P>Tune—<HI>Moderation and Alteration.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>I'LL sing you a song about a young lady that liv'd in Aberdeen,</L>
<L>Whem, in my younger days, I remember to have very often seen;</L>
<L>She had a vast number of suitors, lovers I mean,</L>
<L>Who adored her like a Venus, or an Indian Queen.</L>
<L>Ad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ration!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>She was neither tall nor slender, plump, jolly nor round,</L>
<L>But a good looking damsel as possibly could be found▪</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="032901_0102_0FF73ED1433CC7F8"/>
Heiress of a good many houses, and a bit of very pleasant ground,</L>
<L>Which would have amounted, as was supposed, to very near five thousand pound.</L>
<L>Temptation!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>First <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>osted her <HI>Mr. Starch</HI> the grocer, equipt in a new tye-wig,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h a large flashy curl at each ear, nicely powdered and very trig;</L>
<L>He had great hopes one day of becoming Lord Mayor, so he look'd mighty big,</L>
<L>And came in cutting as many capers as if he had been dancing a jig.</L>
<L>Oftentation!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>He told her, very politely, he had come her affections to engage,</L>
<L>But he had scarcely got the words well spoke, till the lady call'd on her page,</L>
<L>And desired he might shew the gentleman to his shop to fell his Congou and Sage;</L>
<L>So Mr. Starch was very much affronted, and left the house in a terrible rage.</L>
<L>Indignation!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next came a <HI>Lawyer,</HI> as big as my Lord Chancellor, and with majestic bow,</L>
<L>Presented his <HI>petition</HI> in due form—for who had a better title to <HI>sue?</HI></L>
<L>He <HI>swore</HI> he would <HI>plead</HI> her <HI>cause</HI> for <HI>nothing,</HI> which the very <HI>seldom</HI> do,</L>
<L>And that he would bring an <HI>action of forthcoming</HI> against the whole crew.</L>
<L>Litigation!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But proceeding against the right <HI>forms</HI> of love, she treated him with scorn,</L>
<L><HI>Protesting</HI> she never saw such impudence since ever she was born,</L>
<L>She rung her bell instantly on her servants to <HI>put him to the born,</HI></L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="032901_0103_0FF73F0703FCC850"/>
And he was toss'd in a blanket, thrown down stairs, and had his face sadly torn.</L>
<L>Condemnation!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next appeared a <HI>Physician,</HI> a character equally great,</L>
<L>With all the consequential airs of a Minister of State;</L>
<L>And tho', during this bloody scene, he was obliged to wait,</L>
<L>On his appearance he expected a much better fate.</L>
<L>Expectation!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>On his entrance, with some ceremony, he made bold to sit down,</L>
<L>And inform'd her he was a person of great fame and re∣nown,</L>
<L>Well known to all the young bloods of fortune, and rakes in the town,</L>
<L>And that he was even sometimes employed by gentry of of the gown.</L>
<L>Occupation!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>During this speech, in ev'ry feature importance you might trace;</L>
<L>But stretching out his fine white hand to feel her pulse with a grace,</L>
<L>The lady return'd his politeness with a smack in the face,</L>
<L>And bid him begone, for he should never examine her case.</L>
<L>Examination!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next came <HI>Jack Flip,</HI> a good honest open-hearted tar,</L>
<L>Whose face look'd nothing better of many a noble scar;</L>
<L>He swore by his jacket, blood and buttons, that he had travelled—Lord knows how far!</L>
<L>And was all politeness, having studied twenty years on board a Man of War.</L>
<L>Education!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So, coming briskly up, he lay close under her lee-boom,</L>
<L>But finding his tackling not clear, and the weather like to gloom,</L>
<L>And fearing some damages, should the vessel chance to loom,</L>
<L>He about ship the very first broad-side, and left her sea∣room.</L>
<L>Resignation!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="9" REF="032901_0104_0FF73F41AEAEAF00"/>
<L>Then came a Right Worshipful Brother Mason, <HI>accepted and free,</HI></L>
<L>None could claim a better title to lady's favour than he;</L>
<L>But tho' to he sure he told her as much as he could to any She,</L>
<L>She conjured him to be gone, for his secret she car'd not a T.</L>
<L>Conjuration!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Being at length deserted by Lawyers, Physicians, and Beaux,</L>
<L>And arriv'd at the grand climacte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>c of all female woes,</L>
<L>When the pale parchment cheek takes the place of the rose,</L>
<L>And the chin, like a nut-cracker, kisses the nose.</L>
<L>Alteration!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To complete all her folly, which she now view'd with sor∣row and regret,</L>
<L>And to avoid leading apes, which, to be sure, is a very hard fate,</L>
<L>She deter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d to embrace the first offer of a mate;</L>
<L>So consign'd all her charms to an old fool quite worn out of date.</L>
<L>Consignation!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now it must strike every one with astonishment and sur∣prise,</L>
<L>What in the name of wonder could have blinded this lady's bright eyes,</L>
<L>The comforts of youth and of life thus foolishly to despise,</L>
<L>And then, in the end, be contented with a blank for a prize!</L>
<L>Infatuation!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I hope then every pretty young lady, now lift'ning to me,</L>
<L>In this plain obvious moral will most readily agree,</L>
<L><HI>That the fruit should always be pull'd ere it rot on the tree,</HI></L>
<L>When they know what the dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>al termination must be.</L>

<L>A Courting I went to my love,</L>
<L>Who is sweeter than roses in May;</L>
<L>And when I came to her by Jove,</L>
<L>The devil a word could I say.</L>
<L>I walk'd with her into the garden,</L>
<L>There fully intending to woo her!</L>
<L>But may I ne'er be worth a farthing,</L>
<L>If of love I said any thing to her.</L>
<L>I clasp'd her hand close to my breast,</L>
<L>While my heart was as light as a feather;</L>
<L>Yet nothing I said, I protest,</L>
<L>But—Madam 'tis very fine weather.</L>
<L>To an arbour I did her attend,</L>
<L>She ask'd me to come and sit by her;</L>
<L>I crept to the furthermost end,</L>
<L>For I was afraid to come nigh her.</L>
<L>I ask'd her which way was the wind,</L>
<L>For I thought in some talk we must enter;</L>
<L>Why, sir, (she answer'd, and grinn'd)</L>
<L>Have you just sent your wits for a venture?</L>
<L>Then I follow'd her into the house,</L>

<HEAD>SONG. NANCY AND THE MILLER.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ONE midsummer morning, when nature look'd gay,</L>
<L>The birds full of song, and the flocks full of play,</L>
<L>When earth seem'd to answer the smiles from above</L>
<L>And all things proclaim'd it a season of love;</L>
<L>My mother cry'd, Nancy, come hast to the mill,</L>
<L>If the corn be not ground you may scold if you will.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The freedom to use my tongue pleas'd me, no doubt;</L>
<L>A woman, alas! would be nothing without;</L>
<L>I went towards the mill without any delay,</L>
<L>And conn'd o'er the words I determin'd to say:</L>
<L>But when I came near it, I found it stock still,</L>
<L>Bless my stars now, cry'd I, huff him rarely I will.</L>

<L>The Miller to market that instant was gone,</L>
<L>The work it was left to the care of his son:</L>
<L>Now, though I can scold well as any one can,</L>

<L>No corn in the town I'd grind sooner than thine;</L>
<L>There's no one more ready in pleasing the fair,</L>
<L>The mill shall go merrily round, I declare.</L>
<L>But hark how the birds sing, and see how they bill,</L>
<L>I must have a kiss first, I must and I will.</L>

<L>My corn being done, I towards home bent my way,</L>
<L>He whisper'd he'd something of moment to say:</L>

<HEAD>SONG. THE BALLAD SINGERS.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BE it known to all those whosoe'er it regards,</L>
<L>That we singers of ballads were always call'd bards;</L>
<L>And from Ida to Grubb-street the muses who follow</L>
<L>Are, each mother's son the true spawn of Apollo:</L>
<L>Thus recording great men, or a flea, or a star,</L>
<L>Or the spheres, or a jew's-harp, we're all on a par;</L>
<L>Nor in this do I tell you a word of a lie,</L>
<L>For Homer sung ballads, so likewise do I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Don't you know what the antients were?—great things they talk'd,</L>
<L>How they rode on Pegasus—that is to say, walk'd;</L>
<L>That near kindred gods they drove Phoebus's chariot,</L>
<L>The English of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they liv'd in the garret,</L>
<L>And thus they went forward, Diogenes quaff'd,</L>
<L>Heraclitus cried, and Democritus laugh'd,</L>
<L>Menander made multitudes both laugh and cry,</L>
<L>But Homer sung baliads, so likewise do I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="20" REF="032901_0115_0FF734709250CFF0"/>
<L>Thus did they strange whimsical notions pursue;</L>
<L>Some argued upon one leg, and some upon two;</L>
<L>To which last my pretensions are not hypothetic,</L>
<L>For 'tis certainly clear I'm a parapetatic:</L>
<L>Lycurgus and Solon 'bout laws made a pother,</L>
<L>Which went in at one ear and then out at 'tother,</L>
<L>Old songs such as mine are will nobody buy?</L>
<L>Come, Homer fung ballads, fo likewise do I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Historic was Pliny, and Plato divine,</L>
<L>Ovid wrote about love and Anacreon wine;</L>
<L>Great Cicero argued to ev'ry man's palate,</L>
<L>And when he was out—'twas a hole in the ballad:</L>
<L>Thus to great men of old, who have made such a rout,</L>
<L>My claim to call cousin I've fairly made out;</L>
<L>And if any hereafter my right should deny,</L>
<L>Tell 'em Homer sung ballads so likewise do I.</L>

<L>I'VE oftentimes heard my old grandmother say,</L>

<L>Then since things have turn'd out in this here same way,</L>
<L>If I was you, Joe, I'd be wiser next time:</L>
<L>And since all is not gold that glitters, take care,</L>
<L>No more in so slender a net to be catch'd;</L>
<L>Nor to value the castle that's built in the air,</L>
<L>Nor to reckon your chickens before they are hate'd.</L>

<L>I say, Joe, what a comical figure you cut,</L>

<L>Quite queer'd in a minute—Lord, how you did strut,</L>
<L>When you talk'd of your turkies, your hens and your cocks;</L>
<L>And now not a word—well, what would you say,</L>
<L>If I with my little your bad fortunes patc'd:</L>
<L>Would you promise me never again from this day,</L>
<L>To reckon your chickens before they are hatched.</L>

<HEAD>SONG. THE PLAYTHINGS OF LIFE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>ALL men are mere children, all women the same,</L>
<L>Who, increasing in years get a different name;</L>
<L>But still the pursuit of each great girl or boy,</L>
<L>Is after some pretty fantastic new toy.</L>
<L>Which, when first obtain'd, for a moment they prize,</L>
<L>Yet the next they destroy, or neglect, or despise;</L>
<L>While the world's one large nurs'ry of envy and strife,</L>
<L>Where the bantlings contend for the playthings of life.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What more than mere toys, tho' of such high renown,</L>
<L>Are the bishop's lawn sleeves or the judge's fur'd gown?</L>
<L>What coronets, mitres, wigs, patches, or wands,</L>
<L>What ribbands, or medals, caps, tassels, and bands?</L>
<L>What all tinsel of state, jewels, garters and strings,</L>
<L>Which kings can bestow, and which deck even kings?</L>
<L>Yet these are the baubles that generate strife,</L>
<L>Among children who pant for the playthings of life!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hark! mortals, your passions for gew-gaws repress,</L>
<L>To few be attach'd, nor to those to excess;</L>
<L>For excess will to evil convey ev'ry good,</L>
<L>Your joy turn to anguish, to poison your food:</L>
<L>While the choice, made with prudence, by prudence con∣fin'd,</L>
<L>Rids the body feel bliss, without paining the mind;</L>
<L>And thus wise to husband, and husband to wise,</L>
<L>Prove the best and most permanent playthings of life.</L>

<L>For no corpse young or old,</L>

Please to rise, and I'll lend you my hand;—</L>

<LG>
<L>At length, though sore troubled,</L>
<L>To church-yard he hobbled,</L>

<L>I neither need walk, preach, nor pray.</L>

<L>When he came to the grave,</L>

<L>I protest this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> walking</L>
<L>Prevents me from talking;</L>
<L>So, Moses, pray give me a quid.</L>

<LG>
<L>Then he open'd his book,</L>
<L>And therein seem'd to look,</L>
<L>Whilst o'er the page only he squinted;</L>
<L>Crying, Moses, I'm vex'd,</L>
<L>For I can't see the text,</L>
<L>This book is so damnably printed.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Woman of a man born—</L>
<L>No—that's wrong—the leaf's torn;—</L>
<L>Upon woman the natural swell is;</L>
<L>Were men got with child</L>
<L>The world would run wild,</L>

<L>What midwife would do it?</L>
<L>He'd be hardly put to it,</L>
<L>Lord bless us, to lay me and Moses.</L>

We should soon turn to dust,</L>
<L>If we were not to moisten our clay.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Moses, hear what I say,</L>
<L>When 'tis night, 'tis not day.</L>
<L>Now in former times, saints can work miracles,</L>
<L>And raise from the dead—</L>
<L>There's no more to be said—</L>
<L>For, Moses, I've dropt down my spectacles.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Moses—mind what I say;—</L>
<L>Life's alas! but a day—</L>
<L>Nay, sometimes 'tis over at noon;—</L>

<L>Moses answered, amen!—</L>
<L>And thus far we've carry'd the farce on;</L>
<L>'Tis the vice of the times</L>
<L>To relish those rhymes,</L>

<HEAD>SONG. THE LUCKY ESCAPE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>I THAT was once a ploughman, a sailor am now,</L>
<L>No lark that aloft in the sky,</L>
<L>Ever slutter'd his wings to give speed to the plough,</L>
<L>Was so gay and so careless as I.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But my friend was a carfindo aboard a king's ship,</L>
<L>And he ax'd me to go just to sea for a trip,</L>
<L>And he talk'k of such things,</L>
<L>As if sailors were kings,</L>
<L>And so teazing did keep,</L>
<L>That I left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep.</L>
<L>No longer the horn,</L>
<L>Call'd me up in the morn,</L>
<L>I trusted the carfindo and the inconstant wind,</L>
<L>That made me for to go and leave my dear behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>I did not much like to be aboard a ship,</L>
<L>When in danger there's no door to creep out;</L>
<L>I lik'd the jolly tars I lik'd bembo and flip,</L>
<L>But I did not like rocking about:</L>
<L>By and by came hurrican, I did not like that,</L>
<L><PB N="28" REF="032901_0172_0FF742D9AC3202B8"/>
Next a battle that many a sailor laid flat,</L>
<L>Ah! cried I who would roam,</L>
<L>That like me had a home,</L>
<L>When I sow and I'd reap,</L>
<L>Ere I left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep.</L>
<L>Where sweetly the horn,</L>
<L>Call'd me up in the morn,</L>
<L>Ere I trusted the carfindo and the inconstant wind,</L>
<L>That made me for to go and leave my dear behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At last safe I landed and in a whole skin,</L>
<L>Nor did I make any long stay,</L>
<L>Ere I found by a friend that I ax'd for my kin,</L>
<L>Father dead, and my wife ran away:</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Ah who but thyself, said I, hast thou to blame,</L>
<L>Wives loosing their husbands oft loose their good name;</L>
<L>Ah why did I roam,</L>
<L>When so happy at home,</L>
<L>I could sow and could reap,</L>
<L>Ere I left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep.</L>
<L>When so sweetly the horn</L>
<L>Call'd me up in the morn,</L>
<L>Curse light noon the carpenter and the inconstant wind,</L>
<L>That made <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> for to go and leave my dear behind.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why, if that be the case, said this very same friend,</L>
<L>And you b'ent no more minded to roam,</L>
<L>Gi's a shake by the fist, all your care's at an end,</L>
<L>Dad's alive and your wife's safe at home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Stark starting with joy, I lept out of my skin,</L>
<L>Buss'd my wife, mother, sister, and all of my kin;</L>
<L>Now, cried I, let them roam,</L>
<L>Who want a good home,</L>
<L>I am well so I'll keep,</L>
<L>Nor again leave my plough to go ploughing the deep</L>
<L>Once more shall the horn,</L>
<L>Call me up in the morn,</L>
<L>Nor shall any d— carfindo nor the inconstant wind</L>
<L>E'er tempt me for to go and leave my dear behind.</L>
