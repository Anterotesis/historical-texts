<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO THE QUARTERLY and MONTHLY MEETINGS of Friends.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>BELOVED FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>FEELING at this time a renewed concern that the pure principle of Light and Life, and the righ∣teous fruits thereof may spread and prevail amongst mankind, there is an engagement on my heart to labour with my brethren in religious profession, that none of us may be a stumbling block in the way of others; but may so walk that our conduct may reach the pure Wit∣ness in the hearts of such who are not in profession with us.</P>
<P>And, dear Friends, while we publicly own that the Holy Spirit is our leader, the profession is in itself weight∣ty, and the weightiness thereof increaseth, in propor∣tion as we are noted among the professors of Truth, and active in dealing with such who walk disorderly.</P>
<P>Many under our profession for want of due attention, and a perfect resignation, to this Divine Teacher, have in some things manifested a deviation from the purity of our religious principles, and these deviations having crept in amongst us by little and little, and increasing from less to greater, have been so far unnoticed, that some living in them, have been active in putting disci∣pline in practice with relation to others, whose con∣duct hath appeared more dishonourable in the world.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="012630_0002_0F8B9278CC63E3E8"/>
Now as my mind hath been exercised before the Lord, I have seen, that the discipline of the Church of Christ standeth in that which is pure; that it is the wisdom from above which gives authority to discipline, and that the weightiness thereof standeth not in any outward circum∣stances, but in the authority of Christ who is the author of it; and where any walk after the flesh, and not ac∣cording to the purity of Truth, and at the same time are active in putting discipline in practice, a veil is gra∣dually drawn over the purity of discipline, and over that holiness of life, which Christ leads those into, <Q>in whom the love of God is verily perfected,</Q> 1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 5.</P>
<P>When we labour in true love with offenders, and they remain obstinate, it sometimes is necessary to proceed as far as our Lord directed, <Q><HI>Let him be to thee as an heathen man, or a publican,</HI></Q> Mat. xviii. 17.</P>
<P>Now when such are disowned, and they who act there∣in feel Christ made unto them wisdom, and are preserved in his meek, restoring spirit, there is no just cause of offence ministred to any; but when such who are active in dealing with offenders indulge themselves in things which are contrary to the purity of Truth, and yet judge others whose conduct appears more dishonourable than their's, here the pure authority of discipline ceaseth as to such offenders, and a temptation is laid in their way to wrangle and contend;—<HI>"Judge not,"</HI> said our Lord, <HI>"that ye be not judged."</HI> Now this forbidding, alludes to man's judgment, and points out the necessity of our hum∣bly attending to that sanctifying Power under which the Faithful experience the Lord to be "a spirit of judgment to them," <HI>Isa.</HI> xxviii. 6. And as we feel his Holy Spirit to mortify the deeds of the body in us, and can say, <Q>it is no more I that live, but Christ that liveth in me,</Q> here right judgment is known.</P>
<P>And while Divine Love prevails in our hearts, and Self in us is brought under judgment, a preparation is
<PB N="3" REF="012630_0003_0F8B9279989A33D8"/>felt to labour in a right manner with offenders; but it we abide not in this love, our outward performance in dealing with others, degenerates into formality; for <HI>"this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments,"</HI> John i.3.</P>
<P>How weighty are those instructions of our Redeemer concerning religious duties, when he points out, that they who may, should be so obedient to the teachings of the Holy Spirit, that humbly considing in his help, they may say, "Thy name O Father be hallowed! Thy kingdom come! thy will be done on earth, as it is in heaven!"—In this awful state of mind is felt that wor∣ship which stands in doing the will of God, on earth, as it is done in heaven, and keeping the Holy Name sa∣cred? To take a holy profession upon us is awful, nor can we keep this Holy Name sacred, but by humbly abiding under the cross of Christ. The apostle laid a heavy complaint against some who prophaned this Holy Name by their manner of living, "through you," he says, "the name of God is blasphemed among the Gen∣tiles,"<HI>Rom.</HI>
ii. 24.</P>
<P>Some of our ancestors through many tribulations were gathered into the state of true worshippers, and had fel∣lowship in that which is pure, and as one was inwardly moved to kneel down in their assemblies, and publickly call on the name of the Lord, those in the harmony of united exercise then present, joined in the prayer; I mention this in order that we of the present age, may look unto the Rock from whence we were hewn, and remember that to unite in worship, is a union in prayer, and that prayer acceptable to the Father is only in a mind truly sanctified, where the sacred name is kept holy, and the heart resigned to do his will on earth as it is done in heaven, <HI>"If ye abide in me,"</HI> saith Christ, <Q><HI>and my words abide in you, ye shall ask what ye will in my name, and it shall be done unto you.</HI></Q>—Now we know not what
<PB N="4" REF="012630_0004_0F8B927A4A702650"/>to pray for as we ought, but as the Holy Spirit doth open and direct our minds, and as we faithfully yield to its influences, our prayers are in the will of our Heavenly Father, who fails not to grant that which his own Spirit, through his Children, asketh;—thus preservation from sin is known, and the fruits of righteousness are brought forth by such who inwardly unite in prayer.</P>
<P>How weighty are our solemn meetings when the name of Christ is kept holy?</P>
<P>"How precious is that state in which the children of the Lord are so redemed from the love "of this world, that they are accepted and blessed in all that they do." R. Barclay's Apology, p. 404.</P>
<P>How necessary is it that we who profess these princi∣ples, and are outwardly active in supporting them, should faithfully abide in Divine Strength, that <Q><HI>As He who has called us, is holy, so we may be holy in all manner of conversation,</HI></Q> 1 Pet. i. 15.</P>
<P>If one prosessing to be influenced by the Spirit of Christ, propose to unite in a labour to promote rightcousness in the earth, and in time past he hath manifestly deviated from the path of equity, then to act consistent with this principle, his first work is to make restitution so far as he may be enabled; for if he attempts to contribute to∣ward a work intended to promote righteousness, while it appears that he neglecteth, or refuseth to act righte∣ously himself, his conduct has a tendency to entangle the minds of those who are weak in the faith, who behold these things, and to draw a veil over the purity of righ∣teousness, by carrying an appearance as though that was righteousness which is not.</P>
<P>Again, if I propose to assist in supporting those doc∣trines wherein that purity of life is held forth, in which customs proceeding from the spirit of this world have no place, and at the same time strengthen others in those customs by my example; the first step then in an orderly
<PB N="5" REF="012630_0005_0F8B927B05ED5580"/>proceeding, is to cease from those customs myself, and afterwards to labour, as I may be enabled, to promote the like disposition and conduct in others.</P>
<P>To be convinced of the pure principle of Truth, and diligently exercised in walking answerable thereto, is necessary before I can consistently recommend this prin∣ciple to others.—I often feel a labour in spirit, that we who are active members in religious society may experi∣ence in ourselves the truth of those expressions of the Holy One— "I will be sanctisied in them that come nigh me." <HI>Lev.</HI> x. 3.—in this case, my mind hath been often exercised when alone, year after year, for many years, and in the renewings of Divine Love, a tender care hath been incited in me, that we who profess the inward principle of light to be our teacher, may be a family unit∣ed in that purity of worship, which comprehends a ho∣ly life, and ministers instruction to others.</P>
<P>My mind is often drawn towards children in the Truth, who having a small share of the things of this life, and coming to have families may be inwardly exercised before the Lord to support them in a way agreeable to the purity of Truth, in which they may feel his blessing upon them in their labours; the thoughts of such being entangled with customs (contrary to pure wisdom) con∣veyed to them through our hands, doth often very ten∣derly, and movingly affect my heart, and when I look towards, and think on the succeeding generation, fer∣vent desires are raised in me, that we by yielding to that Holy Spirit which leads into all truth, may not do the work of the Lord deceitfully, may not live contrary to the purity of the Divine Principle we profess; but that as faithful labourers in our age, we may be instrumental in removing stumbling blocks out of the way of those who may succeed us.</P>
<P>So great was the love of Christ, that he gave himself for the church, <Q>that he might sanctify and cleanse it,
<PB N="6" REF="012630_0006_0F8B927BC9441DB8"/>that it should be holy, and without blemish, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing,</Q> <HI>Eph.</HI> v. 25. and where any take the name of Christ upon them, profes∣sing to be members of his church, and led by his Holy Spirit, and yet manifestly deviate from the purity of Truth, they herein act against the gracious design of his giving himself for them, and minister cause for the con∣tinuance of his afflictions, viz. in his body the church.</P>
<P>Christ suffered afflictions in a body of flesh prepared by the Father, but the afflictions of his mystical body are yet unfinished; for they who are baptized into Christ are baptized into his death, and as we humbly abide un∣der his sanctifying Power, and are brought forth into newness of life, we feel Christ to live in us, who being the same yesterday, to-day, and forever, and always at unity with himself, his Spirit in the hearts of his people leads to an inward exercise for the salvation of man∣kind; and when under a travail of spirit, we behold a visited people entangled by the spirit of this world with its wickedness and customs, and thereby rendered inca∣pable of being faithful examples to others, sorrow and heaviness under a sense of these things, is often experi∣enced, and thus in some measure is filled up that which remains of the afflictions of Christ.</P>
<P>Our Blessed Saviour speaking concerning gifts offered in Divine Service, says, <Q><HI>If thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there remembrest that thy brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</HI></Q> Mat. v. 23, 24.—Now there is no true unity, but in that wherein the Father, and the Son are united, nor can there be a perfect reconciliation but in ceasing from that which ministers cause for the continuation of the afflictions of Christ; and if any professing to bring their gift to the altar, do remember the customary con∣tradiction which some of their fruits bear to the pure,
<PB N="7" REF="012630_0007_0F8B927C7B170788"/>spiritual worship, here it appears necessary to lay to heart this command, <HI>"leave thy gift by the altar."</HI></P>
<P>Christ graciously calls his people brethren, <Q><HI>whosoever shall do the will of God the same is my brother.</HI></Q> Mark iii. 35. Now if we walk contrary to the Truth as it is in Jesus, while we continue to profess it, we offend against Christ, and if under this offence we bring our gift to the altar, our Redeemer doth not direct us to take back our gift, he doth not discourage our proceeding in a good work; but graciously points out the necessary means by which the gift may be rendered acceptable, "<HI>leave,</HI> saith he, <HI>thy gist by the altar, first go and be reconciled to thy bro∣ther,</HI>" cease from that which grieves the Holy Spirit, cease from that which is against the Truth, as it is in Jesus, and then come, and offer thy gift.</P>
<P>I feel, while I am writing, a tenderness to those who through Divine Favour are preserved in a lively sense of the state of the churches, and at times may be under discouragements with regard to proceeding in that pure way which Christ by his Holy Spirit leads into: the depth of disorder and weakness, which so much prevails, be∣ing opened, doubtings are apt to arise as to the possibi∣lity of proceeding as an assembly of the Lord's people in the pure council of Truth; and here I feel a concern to express in uprightness, that which hath been opened in my mind, under the power of the Cross of Christ, re∣lating to a visible gathered church, the members where∣of are guided by the Holy Spirit.</P>
<P>The church is called the body of Christ, <HI>Col.</HI> i. 24.</P>
<P>Christ is called the head of the church, <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 22.</P>
<P>The church is called the Pillar, and ground of Truth, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 15.</P>
<P>Thus the church hath a name that is sacred, and the necessity of keeping this name holy, appears evident; for where a number of people unite in a profession of being led by the Spirit of Christ, and publish their principles
<PB N="8" REF="012630_0008_0F8B927D4A9486D0"/>to the world, the acts and proceedings of that people may in some measure be considered as such which Christ is the author of.</P>
<P>Now while we stand in this station, if the pure light of life is not followed and regarded in our proceedings, we are in the way of prophaning the Holy Name, and of going back toward that wilderness of sufferings and persecution, out of which, through the tender mercies of God, a church hath been gathered; <Q><HI>Christ liveth in sanctified vessels,</HI></Q> <HI>Gal.</HI> ii. 20. and where they behold his Holy Name profanced, and the pure Gospel Light eclipsed through the unfaithfulness of any who by their station appear to be standard bearers under the Prince of Peace, the living members in the body of Christ in beholding these things, do in some degree experience the fellowship of his sufferings, and as the wisdom of the world more and more takes place in conducting the affairs of this visible gathered church, and the pure leadings of the Holy Spirit less waited for and followed, so the true suffering seed is more and more oppressed.</P>
<P>My mind is often affected with a sense of the condi∣tion of sincere hearted people in some kingdoms, where liberty of conscience is not allowed, many of whom be∣ing burthened in their minds with prevailing superstition joined with oppressions, are often under sorrow, and where such have attended to that pure Light which hath in some degree opened their understandings, and for their faithfulness thereto, have been brought to exami∣nation and tryal, how heavy are the persecutions which in divers parts of the world are exercised upon them? How mighty, as to the outward, is that power by which they are borne down, and oppressed?</P>
<P>How deeply affecting is the condition of many upright hearted people who are taken into the papal inquisition? What lamentable cruelties, in deep vaults, in a private way, are exercised on many of them? and how linger∣ing
<PB N="9" REF="012630_0009_0F8B927F7B8D1E00"/>is that death by a small slow fire, which they have frequently indured, who have been faithful to the end?</P>
<P>How many tender-spirited protestants have been sen∣tenced to spend the remainder of their lives in a galley chained to oars, under hard-hearted masters, while their young children are placed out for education, and taught principles so contrary to the conscience of the parents, that by dissenting from them, they have hazarded their liberty, lives, and all that was dear to them of the things of this world?</P>
<P>There have been in time past severe persecutions un∣der the English government, and many sincere-hearted people have sussered death for the testimony of a good conscience, whose faithfulness in their day hath mini∣stred encouragement to others, and been a blessing to many who have succeeded them; thus from age to age, the darkness being more and more removed, a channel at length, through the tender mercies of God, hath been opened for the exercise of the pure gift of the gospel mi∣nistry, without interruption from outward power, a work, the like of which is rare, and unknown in many parts of the world.</P>
<P>As these things are often fresh in my mind, and this great work of God going on in the earth has been open before me, that liberty of conscience with which we are favoured, hath appeared not as a light matter.</P>
<P>A trust is committed to us, a great and weighty trust, to which our diligent attention is necessary, wherever the active members of this visible gathered church use them∣selves to that which is contrary to the purity of our principles, it appears to be a breach of this trust, and one step back toward the wilderness, one step towards undo∣ing what God in infinite love hath done through his faith∣ful servants, in a work of several ages, and like laying the foundation for future sufferings.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="012630_0010_0F8B927FA815BBE8"/>
I feel a living invitation in my mind to such who are active in our religious society, that we may lay to heart this matter, and consider the station in which we stand; a place of outward liberty under the free exercise of our conscience toward God, not obtained but through great and manifold afflictions of those who lived before us. There is gratitude due from us to our Heavenly Father, and justice to our posterity; can our hearts endure, or our hands be strong, if we desert a cause so precious, if we turn aside from a work under which so many have patiently laboured?</P>
<P>May the deep sufferings of our Saviour be so dear to us, that we nay never trample underfoot the adorable Son of God, nor count the blood of the covenant unho∣ly!</P>
<P>May the faithfulness of the martyrs when the prospect of death by fire was before them, be remembred! and may the patient constant sufferings of the upright-hearted servants of God in latter ages be revived in our minds! and may we so follow on to know the Lord, that neither the faithful in this age, nor those in ages to come, may ever be brought under suffering, through our slid∣ing back from the work of reformation in the world!</P>
<P>While the active members in the visible gathered church stand upright, and the asfairs thereof are carried on under the leadings of the Holy Spirit, altho' disorders may arise among us, and cause many exercises to those who feel the care of the churches upon them; yet while these continue under the weight of the work, and labour in the meekness of wisdom for the help of others, the name of Christ in the visible gathered church may be kept sacred; but while they who are active in the affairs of this church, continue in a manifest opposition to the purity of our principles, this as the prophet Isaiah x. 18. expresseth it, is like <HI>"as when a standard bearer fainteth,"</HI> and thus the way opens to great, and prevailing de∣generacy,
<PB N="11" REF="012630_0011_0F8B928058718D98"/>and to sufferings for such who through the power of Divine Love, are separated to the gospel of Christ, and cannot unite with any thing which stands in opposition to the purity of it.</P>
<P>The necessity of an inward stillness, hath under these exercises appeared clear to my mind; in true silence strength is renewed, the mind herein is weaned from all things, but as they may be enjoyed in the Divine Will, and a lowliness in outward living opposite to world∣ly honour, becomes truly acceptable to us;—in the de∣sire after outward gain, the mind is prevented from a perfect attention to the voice of Christ, but being weaned from all things, but as they may be enjoyed in the Di∣vine Will, the pure light shines into the soul, and where the fruits of that spirit which is of this world, are brought forth by many who profess to be lead by the Spirit of Truth, and cloudiness is felt to be gathering over the visible gathered church, the sincere in heart who abide in true stillness, and are exercised therein before the Lord for his name sake, have a knowledge of Christ in the fellowship of his sufferings, and inward thankfulness is felt at times, that through Divine Love, our own wisdom is cast out, and that forward active part in us subjected, which would rise and do something in the vi∣sible gathered church, without the pure leadings of the Spirit of Christ.</P>
<P>While aught remains in us different from a perfect re∣signation of our wills, it is like a seal to a book where∣in is written <Q>that good, and acceptable, and perfect will of God concerning us,</Q> <HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 2. but when our minds entirely yield to Christ, that silence is known, which followeth the opening of the last of the seals, <HI>Rev.</HI> viii. 1. in this silence we learn abiding in the Divine Will, and there feel, that we have no cause to promote but that only in which the light of life directs us in our proceedings, and that the alone way to be useful in the
<PB N="12" REF="012630_0012_0F8B928103687790"/>church of Christ, is to abide faithfully under the lead∣ings of his Holy Spirit in all cases, and being preserved thereby in purity of heart, and holiness of conversation, a testimony to the purity of his government may be held forth through us, to others.</P>
<P>As my mind hath been thus exercised, I have seen that to be active, and busy in the visible gathered church, without the leadings of the Holy Spirit is not only un∣profitable, but tends to increase dimness, and where way is not opened to proceed in the light of Truth, a stop is felt by those who humbly attend to the Divine Leader, a stop which in relation to good order in the visible ga∣thered church, is of the greatest consequence to be ob∣served; thus Robert Barclay in his treatise on discipline holds forth, page 65, 68, 84. <Q><HI>that the judgment or con∣clusion of the church or congregation, is no further effectual "as to the true end and design thereof, but as such judgment "or conclusion proceeds from the Spirit of God operating on their minds who are sanctified in Christ Jesus.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Now in this stop I have learned the necessity of waiting on the Lord in humility, that the works of all may be brought to the light, and those to judgment which are wrought in the wisdom of this world, and have also seen, that in a mind thoroughly subjected to the power of the Cross, there is a savour of life to be felt, which evidently tends to gather souls to God, while the greatest works in the visible gathered church brought forth in man's wisdom, remain to be unprofitable.</P>
<P>Where people are divinely gathered into a holy fel∣lowship, and faithfully abide under the influence of that Spirit which leads into all Truth, "they are the light of the world," <HI>Mat.</HI> v. 14. Now holding this professi∣on, to me hath appeared weighty, even beyond what I can fully express, and what our Blessed Lord seemed to have in view, when he proposed the necessity of counting the cost, before we begin to build.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="012630_0013_0F8B9281C3CAAC30"/>
I trust there are many who at times, under Divine vi∣sitation, feel an inward enquiry after God, and when such in the simplicity of their hearts mark the lives of a people who profess to walk by the leadings of his Spi∣rit, of what great concernment is it that our lights shine clear, that nothing of our conduct carry a contradiction to the Truth as it is in Jesus, or be a means of profaning his Holy Name, and be a stumbling block in the way of those sincere enquirers.</P>
<P>When such seekers who wearied with empty forms, look toward uniting with us as a people, and behold active members among us depart in their customary way of living, from that purity of life, which under humbling exercises hath been opened before them, as the way of the Lord's people, how mournful and discouraging is the prospect? and how strongly doth such unfaithfulness operate against the spreading of the peaceable, harmoni∣ous principle and testimony of Truth amongst mankind?</P>
<P>In entering into that life, which is hid with Christ in God, we behold his peaceable government, where the whole family are governed by the same spirit, and the "doing to others as we would they should do unto us," groweth up as good fruit from a good tree, the peace, quietness, and harmonious walking in this government is beheld with humble reverence to him who is the au∣thor of it, and in partaking of the Spirit of Christ, we partake of that which labours, and suffers for the increase of this peaceable government among the inhabitants of the world; and I have felt a labour of long continuance that we who profess this peaceable principle, may be faithful standard bearers under the Prince of Peace, and that nothing of a defiling nature, tending to discord and wars, may remain among us.</P>
<P>May each of us query with ourselves, have the trea∣sures I possess, been gathered in that wisdom which is from above, so far as hath appeared to me?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="012630_0014_0F8B92829A17C770"/>
Have none of my fellow-creatures an equitable right to any part which is called mine?</P>
<P>Have the gifts, and possessions received by me from others been conveyed in a way free from all unrighte∣ousness so far as I have seen?</P>
<P>The principle of peace in which our trust is only on the Lord, and our minds weaned from a dependance on the strength of armies, hath appeared to me very preci∣ous, and I often feel strong desires, that we who profess this principle, may so walk, as to give just cause for none of our fellow-creatures to be offended at us; that our lives may evidently manifest, that we are redeemed from that spirit in which wars are: Our blessed Saviour in pointing out the danger of so leaning on man, as to neglect the leadings of his Holy Spirit, said, <Q><HI>Call no man your father upon the earth; for one is your father which is in heaven,</HI></Q> Mat. xxiii. 9. where the wisdom from above is faithfully followed, and therein we are entrusted with substance, it is a treasure committed to our care in the nature of an inheritance, as an inheri∣tance from him, who formed, and supports the world. Now in this condition the true enjoyment of the good things of this life is understood, and that blessing felt, in which is real safety; this is what I apprehend our blessed Lord had in view, when he pronounced, <Q><HI>Bles∣sed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Selfish worldly minded men may hold lands in the selfish spirit, and depending on the strength of the out∣ward power, be perplexed with secret uncasiness, lest the injured should sometime overpower them, and that measure meted to them, which they measure to others. —Thus selfish men may possess the earth; but it is the meek who inherit it, and enjoy it as an inheritance from the Heavenly Father, free from all the desilements and perplexities of unrighteousness.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="012630_0015_0F8B928341AAF0E0"/>
Where proceedings have been in that wisdom which is from beneath, and inequitable gain gathered by a man, and left as a gift to his children, who being entangled by the same worldly spirit, have not attained to that clear∣ness of light in which the channels of righteousness are opened, and justice done to those who remain silent under injuries: here I have seen under humbling ex∣ercise of mind, that the sins of the fathers are embraced by the children, and become their sins, and thus in the days of tribulation, the iniquities of the fathers are vi∣sited upon these children, who take hold of the unrigh∣teousness of their fathers, and live in that spirit in which those iniquities were committed; to which agreeth the prophesy of Moses, concerning a rebellious people. <Q><HI>They that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquities, in your enemy's land, and in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away.</HI></Q> Lev. xxvi. 39. and our blessed Lord in beholding the hardness of heart in that generati∣on, and feeling in himself, that they lived in the same spirit in which the prophets had been persecuted unto death, signisied, <Q><HI>that the blood of all the prophets which was shed from the foundation of the world, should be re∣quired of that generation, from the blood of Abel, unto the blood of Zacharias, who perished between the altar and the temple.</HI></Q> Luke xi. 51.</P>
<P>Tender compassion fills my heart toward my fellow creatures estranged from the harmonious government of the Prince of Peace, and a labour attends me, that they may be gathered to this peaceable habitation.</P>
<P>In being inwardly prepared to suffer adversity for Christ's sake, and weaned from a dependance on the arm of flesh, we feel, that there is a rest for the people of God, and that it stands in a perfect resignation of our∣selves to his holy will; in this condition, all our wants and desires are bounded by pure wisdom, and our minds wholly attentive to the council of Christ inwardly com∣municated,
<PB N="16" REF="012630_0016_0F8B9283FB3322D8"/>which hath appeared to me as a habitation of safety for the Lord's people, in times of outward commotion and trouble, and desires from the fountain of pure love, are opened in me, to invite my brethren and fellow creatures to feel for, and seek after that which gathers the mind into it.</P>
