<HEAD>THE Piety &amp; Duty of RULERS, To Comfort and Encourage the Ministry of CHRIST.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>II. CHRON. XXX. 22.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And Hezekiah spake Comfortably unto all the Levites, that taught the Good Knowledge of the LORD.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the <HI>Context</HI> we have a Record of the glo∣rious Beginning of King <HI>Hezekiahs</HI> Reign. The wicked <HI>Ahaz,</HI> this pious <HI>Prince</HI> his <HI>Father,</HI> had <HI>transgressed sore against the Lord</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">xxviii. <HI>Chap.</HI> 19, 22, 23, 24, 25. <HI>verses.</HI></NOTE>, forsaken His <HI>Altars,</HI> exhausted the Sacred Treasures of his <HI>House, cut in pieces</HI> the Holy <HI>Vessels,</HI> and at last <HI>shut up the Doors</HI> of it; making himself <HI>Altars in every Corner of Jerusalem, and High Places in every City of Judah, to burn Incense unto other gods.</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="001346_0005_0FB2C71C08125C48"/>This was the forlorn State of the <HI>Church</HI> upon <HI>He∣zekiahs</HI> Accession to the Throne, who immediate∣ly, even<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">xxix. 3.</NOTE> <HI>in the first year of his Reign, in the first Month, op'ned the doors of the House of the Lord and repaired them;</HI> Summoning the <HI>Priests</HI> and the <HI>Le∣vites</HI> to<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">v. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Sanctify</HI> themselves and the <HI>House;</HI> to humble themselves for the Sins of their <HI>Fathers</HI> <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">v. 6.</NOTE>, to renew their <HI>Covenant with the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">v. 10.</NOTE>, and to offer a <HI>Sin offering for the Kingdom</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">v. 21.</NOTE>, to <HI>make Re∣conciliation</HI> with the Blood upon the Altar, and <HI>Attonement for all Israel</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">v. 24.</NOTE>. When this was done he proceeded to proclaim a<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Chap.</HI> xxx. 6, 7, 8, 9. <HI>verses.</HI></NOTE> Solemn <HI>Passover,</HI> which was joyfully and religiously Solemniz'd: <HI>With great Gladness;</HI> says the <HI>verse</HI> before the <HI>Text, and the Levites and the Priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with loud Instruments unto the LORD.</HI> It was at the Celebration of this <HI>Passover,</HI> the <HI>Joy</HI> whereof had been never equal'd since the days of <HI>Solomon</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">v. 26.</NOTE>, that the <HI>Good King</HI> among other Ex∣pressions of his Devotion gave that which the <HI>Text</HI> records to his Immortal Honour; <HI>And Hezekiah spake Comfortably unto all the Levites, that taught the good Knowledge of the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>We may here remark,</P>
<P N="1">1. The Character of the <HI>Persons</HI> concerned, <HI>He∣zekiah</HI> and the <HI>Levites:</HI> On both sides <HI>Persons of Distinction,</HI> the <HI>One</HI> in Civil, the <HI>Other</HI> in Ecclesiasti∣cal Office. <HI>Hezekiah</HI> was no less than the <HI>King of Judah,</HI> the Supream Civil Ruler: the <HI>Levites</HI> were
<PB N="3" REF="001346_0006_0FB2C71E0C5159D0"/>Ministers of Religion, after the <HI>Priests</HI> the Sons of <HI>Aaron;</HI> the <HI>Tribe</HI> whom God had separated and consecrated to Himself out of all <HI>Isreal to do the Service of the Tabernacle.</HI> So that the Civil &amp; Sa∣cred <HI>Orders</HI> are here together, the <HI>Prince</HI> and the <HI>Prophet,</HI> the Ruler in the <HI>State,</HI> and the Holy Teachers in the <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Let us attend unto the <HI>thing related</HI> as passing between them, which is the <HI>Kings</HI> speaking Com∣fortably unto the <HI>Levites.</HI> The like we read in the 35. <HI>Chap.</HI> 2. <HI>v.</HI> of <HI>Josiah, that he set the Priests in their charges, and Encourag'd them to the Service of the House of the Lord.</HI> His Dignity made this Conde∣scention in the sight of men, yet was it but strict Piety and Duty to God. He might have requir'd 'em only with the stern Majesty of a King, but as became his Devotion he mildly &amp; kindly bespoke 'em, with a sweet and gracious Affability. His Countenance, his Behaviour, and all his Words did abundantly express his Royal Favour &amp; Grace toward 'em, for their Incouragement in their Holy Ministrations. Nor are we to interpret these Comfortable Expressions of <HI>Good Words</HI> only, <HI>Be ye warmed, be ye filled;</HI> without the substantial fruits of a <HI>Princes</HI> Favour &amp; Care. Much less may we think them like the <HI>Empty Respects,</HI> flatteries &amp; promises of <HI>Modern Courtiers;</HI> but all was Cordial, unfeigned &amp; from the Heart: As we may read in the 31. <HI>Chap.</HI> 21. <HI>v.</HI> that <HI>in every work, which he began in the Ser∣vice of the House of God, and in the Law, and in the Commandments to seek his God, he did it with all his heart, and prospered.</HI> Wherefore,</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>real Reason of this Princely Grace</HI> of the
<PB N="4" REF="001346_0007_0FB2C721A6A9B098"/><HI>King</HI> is subjoyned, and that is, <HI>the Levites teaching the good Knowledge of the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Reason</HI> is taken partly from their <HI>Office,</HI> more especially from their <HI>Fidelity</HI> therein: And so it answers the <HI>Apostolick Precept, Esteeming them very highly in Love for their Works sake.</HI> It was one part of the <HI>Levites</HI> Office to <HI>instruct</HI> the People in the Knowledge and Fear of God: their work was to <HI>teach:</HI> which reproves and condemns the <HI>Idle Pastor,</HI> who <HI>Labours</HI> not <HI>in the Word and Doctrine,</HI> to feed their Flocks with Saving Knowledge, And <HI>King Hezekiahs</HI> regard to the <HI>Teaching Levite</HI> may well call to Mind the like <HI>Royal Examples,</HI> which have blazon'd the <HI>British Throne,</HI> in our late <HI>Sovereign Princes,</HI> who have re∣quir'd their <HI>Highest Prelates</HI> to be frequent in Preaching the <HI>Word</HI> Themselves; promoting at the same time such unto their Richest and Noblest <HI>Sees,</HI> as were desirous of teaching the People the Knowledge of God. In the day when <HI>Popery ab∣dicated the Throne, Princes</HI> like holy <HI>Hezekiah</HI> ascend∣ed it, and they <HI>spake Comfortably,</HI> and to this day continue the same Gracious Expressions to all the <HI>Levites</HI> that teach the Good Knowledge of the Lord.</P>
<P><HI>The Good Knowledge:</HI> Knowledge is Good: <HI>Prov.</HI> 19 2. <HI>That the Soul be without Knowledge is not Good:</HI> But of all Knowledge none is like that which we have of the <HI>Blessed GOD</HI> from his <HI>Word:</HI> Of <HI>this</HI> we may say, as our <HI>Saviour</HI> said of <HI>God, Why call</HI> we <HI>any</HI> other <HI>Good? there is none Good save</HI> that <HI>One, which is</HI> of <HI>GOD.</HI> They that teach this good Knowledge faithfully, are to be held among Men eminently Good, <HI>Worthy of double Honour,</HI> meriting to be
<PB N="5" REF="001346_0008_0FB2C72590A12808"/>spoken <HI>Comfortably</HI> unto by their <HI>Princes</HI> &amp; <HI>Rulers:</HI> Each of them singly, and all of them together, do merit this treatment and a singular Regard: And accordingly, tho' the <HI>Text denies not</HI> but that the <HI>King</HI> might <HI>frown</HI> upon the <HI>Idle and Vicious Levite,</HI> if there were any One so; yet is it <HI>express</HI> on the other hand, that he spake comfortably to <HI>all</HI> those <HI>Levites,</HI> that did <HI>faithfully</HI> teach the Good Know∣ledge of the Lord.</P>
<P>The DOCTRINE I wou'd offer from the <HI>Words</HI> is this.</P>
<P><HI>That it is a very Noble &amp; Pious Disposition in Civil Rulers, and their Incumbent Duty, to Comfort and Encourage the faithful Ministers of</HI> CHRIST <HI>in their Holy Work.</HI></P>
<P>Before I add a Word more, I have a double <HI>Presumption to Apologize</HI> for; that I shou'd presume to <HI>Preach</HI> to, or to <HI>plead</HI> for, my <HI>Superiors</HI> of <HI>both Orders.</HI> I am very sensible that a <HI>Concio ad Ma∣gistratum</HI> calls for Learning, Gravity &amp; Authority much beyond my Years, and that the <HI>Noble Sub∣ject (Pro Clere)</HI> does equally require the same. Yet I hope it will not be unacceptable at this time to Either <HI>Order,</HI> if I essay with all possible Defe∣rence and Humility, to assert the <HI>Honours</HI> which it has pleased God to entitle his <HI>Ministry</HI> unto, &amp; which it will be the Care and <HI>Pleasure</HI> of pious <HI>Rulers</HI> al∣ways to pay unto them.</P>
<P>Wherefore I beg the leave of this <HI>Honourable Au∣dience</HI> to persue a little these two <HI>Enquiries.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>How</HI> Civil Rulers are to endeavour the Com∣fort
<PB N="6" REF="001346_0009_0FB2C7267291FBE0"/>and Encouragement of the Gospel Ministry?</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Why</HI> they shou'd do it, or what are their Ob∣ligations hereunto. The <HI>Enquiries</HI> are both <HI>Co∣pious,</HI> and being to get <HI>hastily</HI> thro' them I must be brief and <HI>general.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>How, or which way, are Civil Rulers to endea∣vour the Comfort of the Ministry?</HI> or, What is <HI>the Comfort</HI> which the <HI>Ministry</HI> craves or challenges of them by the Laws of the Gospel? What is it that will comfort the faithful <HI>Dispensers</HI> of the Word, and what are the <HI>Regards</HI> which for this end the <HI>Civil Ruler</HI> owes unto the <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Order?</P>
<P>To apprehend this aright, we must consider our <HI>Rulers</HI> in their <HI>Legislative</HI> Power or Trust, and in their <HI>Executive,</HI> and finally in a <HI>Personal</HI> and more <HI>Private</HI> Character, as <HI>Christians</HI> of a <HI>Superior Degree</HI> only.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>In their Legislative power and trust,</HI> it belongs to the Civil Ruler to speak comfortably to the Mi∣nistry, <HI>by Enacting Good LAWS for the Honour and Establishment of Religion within their Government.</HI> This lies near the heart of every good man; and one of the greatest Comforts he can have that wishes well to the Religion of a Place, aiming at the Glory of God and the Salvation of Souls, is to see a <HI>Bulwark of good Laws</HI> for the defence &amp; pro∣pagation of the Truths and Laws of God. These Laws must needs respect,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. The Publick <HI>Worship</HI> of God, both Natural and Instituted.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The Peace, Order, <HI>Discipline</HI> and Government of the Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The Honourable <HI>Maintenance</HI> of the Ministry. And 4. A Peoples <HI>Morals.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="001346_0010_0FB2C727F24D78D0"/>
1. The Comfort of the Ministry depends very much on good and right <HI>Laws respecting the Publick Worship of God, and that both Natural &amp; Instituted:</HI> that the <HI>Holy Ordinances</HI> of God be duly administred and attended according to His Appointment in His Word. Indeed <HI>Magistrates</HI> may not <HI>frame</HI> and invent at their pleasure <HI>Modes</HI> and Exercises of Divine Worship for their People: GOD by whom They rule has given Them &amp; Us a <HI>Law</HI> how He will be Worship'd: to <HI>alter</HI> this or to <HI>add</HI> unto it were to offer <HI>Strange Fire</HI> for hallowed Incense and with the face of Homage manifestly to kick at his Soverain Authority, despising his most per∣fect Word. Nor may the Ruler <HI>invade the Priest, Office to Officiate in their Holy Ministrations,</HI> unto which they are <HI>Ordain'd.</HI> It was unto <HI>Uzziahs</HI> destruction that his <HI>heart was lifted up to transgress against the Lord his God,</HI> when he went into the Temple of the Lord <HI>to burn Intense upon the Altar of Incense:</HI> 2 Chron. xxvi. 16,—21. Nor was it Dis∣loyalty or Rebellion in <HI>Azariah the Priest</HI> and his valiant <HI>Brethren</HI> when they <HI>withstood</HI> him, and said unto him, <HI>It pertaineth not unto thee Uzziah to burn Incense unto the Lord, but to the Priests the Sons of Aa∣ron, that are consecrated to burn Incense: Go out of the Sanctuary, for thou hast trespassed, neither shall it be for thine Honour from the Lord God:</HI> And when he des∣pis'd the faithful admonition, being <HI>Inrag'd</HI> at it, <HI>The Lord smote him beside the. Altar, with the Censer in his hand; the Leprosie rose up in his forehead,</HI> and he <HI>hasted</HI> to leave the Sacred place he had invaded, <HI>being a Leper to the day of his death,</HI> and so cut off from the House of the Lord, whither he had gone
<PB N="8" REF="001346_0011_0FB2C72972B86FA0"/>so presumptuously. Now tho' this <HI>Instance</HI> alone be eno' to warn the <HI>Highest Persons</HI> unto all possible caution, not to trespass upon the <HI>Inclosures of Gods Ministry,</HI> consecrated to <HI>Divine Service;</HI> Neverthe∣less we must by no means think that the <HI>Magistrate</HI> has nothing to do, or to concern himself <HI>ex Officio,</HI> about the <HI>Institutions of God.</HI> The <HI>Civil Powers</HI> may Enact the very Laws of God about his own Wor∣ship under temporal <HI>Penalties,</HI> preserving an <HI>Indul∣gence</HI> unto tender Consciences: They may take Laws out of the Word of God and make 'em their <HI>Own,</HI> Commanding People to <HI>regard</HI> the holy <HI>Or∣dinances</HI> of God, to <HI>get</HI> &amp; <HI>uphold</HI> his <HI>Worship</HI> among them, to <HI>Sanctifie the Sabbath,</HI> to <HI>reverence</HI> Gods <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> to <HI>build</HI> themselves <HI>decent places</HI> for the Publick Worship, and <HI>frequent</HI> them in the stated seasons thereof with Solemnity.</P>
<P>It belongs also to the Rulers Province, to pro∣vide that <HI>Ministers do their Duty</HI> in the Publick Ad∣ministrations that pertain unto their Office; that neither by <HI>gross Neglects,</HI> Unreasonable <HI>Absence</HI> from their <HI>Charge, Non-residence,</HI> open <HI>Idleness,</HI> or any Scandalous course of <HI>Vice,</HI> they <HI>do not defeat</HI> the glo∣rious Design of their Ministry: in all which <HI>Cases</HI> the Civil Cognizance is merited, and needed to rebuke and remedy the Evil; and Rulers ought to provide accordingly in subordination to the Laws of <HI>Christ,</HI> provided in that case already. So that if the <HI>Sons of Eli</HI> will make themselves <HI>Vile,</HI> to cause men to <HI>abhor</HI> the Offering of the Lord, it is duty of the <HI>Judge in Israel,</HI> tho' he be their <HI>Father,</HI> to pro∣vide them not only a <HI>light</HI> Rebuke, but a severe Censure, Degradation and Punishment.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="001346_0012_0FB2C72AF3D8BC50"/>
In all such Cases both Ministers and People <HI>owe Obedience and Submission</HI> to the Civil Ruler, as in our <HI>Context</HI> the <HI>Priests</HI> and the <HI>Levites</HI> obeyed the Summons of the <HI>King,</HI> and did the thing which he requir'd in the cause of God and agreeable to his Will: xxix. <HI>Chap.</HI> 15. <HI>v. And they gathered their Brethren, and Sanctify'd themselves, and came according to the Commandment of the King, by the Word of the Lord.</HI> Being that the Kings Commandment was according to and grounded on the Law of God, they conscientiously obey'd it, in deference both to God and the King.</P>
<P>Nor are the Holy Sons of <HI>Levi</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> duly <HI>comforted</HI> in the work of the Lord, in their Serving at the Tabernacle and Temple, unless the Civil Power do thus engage on their side. For as the World goes, 'tis necessary for the Powers' on Earth to enforce that under present <HI>bodily Pains</HI> &amp; tem∣poral Penalties, which the Great GOD has more awfully commanded on pain of <HI>Eternal Damnation:</HI> that bold Sinners who have no regard to their <HI>Souls</HI> may be restrain'd however by what they have for their <HI>Bodies,</HI> their <HI>Name, Estates</HI> and outward Interests; and that men who will not <HI>Fear God</HI> so as to be religious in secret and in heart, may how∣ever for <HI>Fear of Man</HI> at least not be Audacious and Insolent, blaspheme the Name of God, nor spit at his Altars; which many profane Wretches wou'd do, if the Civil Sword did not defend and do Ho∣nour to the Worship of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Comfort of the Ministry depends very much on Good and Right Laws with respect to <HI>the Peace &amp; Order, Discipline and Government of the
<PB N="10" REF="001346_0013_0FB2C72D4A962CB0"/>Churches.</HI> It is true, that the <HI>Magistracy</HI> are not to assume to themselves the Administration of <HI>Church Censures,</HI> but to preserve inviolate unto the <HI>Ministry</HI> the Power of <HI>Judgment,</HI> which <HI>Christ</HI> has lodg'd in them: Yet is it not to be tho't that the Magistrate must sit by <HI>Unconcerned,</HI> and quietly see things run to <HI>Confusion,</HI> and the wounds of Churches to <HI>Gan∣green</HI> and grow Incurable: Or if the State of the Church be visibly <HI>Consumptive,</HI> and it be sensibly pining and languishing away, the <HI>Pastors</HI> not eno' laying it to heart, and the <HI>People</HI> thro' Inadvertence willing to have it so; Is it not <HI>Laudable</HI> &amp; a Duty for <HI>Rulers</HI> in such a case to take Care? to issue out their <HI>Authoritative Orders,</HI> to stir up Ministers and People to their Respective Duties? for the <HI>Revival</HI> of dying <HI>Church Order,</HI> and the Spirit of true <HI>De∣votion,</HI> with practical Godliness, which depend so much thereupon.</P>
<P>As therefore it is the worthy Care of Rulers to <HI>Admonish the Churches</HI> of any gross defects and neg∣ligences, hazards and dangers, maladies and distempers, which they discern upon us at any time in Spiritual Respects; So also their Wisdom and Piety wou'd be greatly display'd at this day, and they wou'd do much to comfort the faithful Ministers of Christ thro' the Land, if they cou'd any way provide to heal the long <HI>Unsettlement of bereaved Churches,</HI> together with the criminal shame∣ful <HI>Quarrels</HI> that occasion it; to give <HI>Authority al∣so to Ecclesiastical Councils</HI> in their Determinations; and to make People know <HI>that there must and shall be some End</HI> to their Strifes &amp; Discords, the Parents of every <HI>Confusion &amp; Evil Work,</HI> the <HI>bane</HI> of all Re∣ligion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="001346_0014_0FB2C7326599A028"/>
It belongs also to the Civil Powers <HI>to call Synods</HI> upon Occasion for these Ends, and then to give their <HI>Sanction</HI> to their just and approved <HI>Resolutions.</HI> Nor are the hands of <HI>Aaron</HI> strong, but when <HI>Mo∣ses,</HI> his Brother and his Lord, stands by and assists him.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Comfort of the Ministry depends very much on Good and sufficient Laws <HI>for the Honou∣rable Support and Maintenance thereof,</HI> and that in <HI>a Wise and Right Manner.</HI> So <HI>Hezekiah</HI> comforted the <HI>Levites</HI> in the <HI>Text,</HI> as we read in the xxxi. <HI>Chap.</HI> 4. <HI>v. Moreover, he commanded the People that dwelt at Jerusalem, to give the portion of the Priests and the Le∣vites, that they might be Encouraged in the Work of the Lord.</HI> The <HI>Wise King</HI> knew that they cou'd not chearfully, diligently, wholly devote themselves to the <HI>Study</HI> of the Law, the Instruction of the People, and the Ministrations of the Sanctuary, without that Honourable <HI>Subsistence,</HI> which God had provided for them.</P>
<P>I need not say how <HI>Noble the Provision</HI> was that God made for the <HI>Tribe of Levi,</HI> nor how plain the <HI>Gospel Institution</HI> is, <HI>That they that Preach the Gospel shou'd live of the Gospel.</HI> So hath the <HI>Lord Ordained,</HI> even as we know that under the <HI>Law,</HI> They who did Minister about Holy things, <HI>lived of the things of the Temple,</HI> and they that waited at the Altar <HI>were Partakers with the Altar.</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 13, 14. Which Institution has its foundation in strict E∣quity &amp; Righteousness <HI>v.</HI> 7. <HI>For who goeth a War∣fare at his own Charges? who planteth a Vineyard and eateth not of the Fruit thereof? or who feedeth a Flock and eateth not of the Milk of the Flock?</HI> Nay, the
<PB N="12" REF="001346_0015_0FB2C734BB94BF20"/>Advantage of the <HI>Exchange</HI> is so much on the side of the <HI>People,</HI> that after all they do by no means pay the Labours of their Faithful <HI>Pastors,</HI> nor re∣compence for the Profits received by those Labours if it be not their own fault: <HI>v.</HI> ii. <HI>If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great thing if we shall reap your carnal things?</HI> No truly, 'tis a small mat∣ter for People to subsist them in a few outward things, whom God has separated wholly from worldly things, to Serve them in their Spiritual and Soul concerns.</P>
<P>Now I need not labour much to prove to You, that <HI>there can be no great Comfort</HI> in the Ministerial Work without a decent outward Subsistence: Un∣less the <HI>Angels of the Churches</HI> were already <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>as the Angels of God</HI> above, as the Saints will be in the <HI>Resurrection</HI> State; when as they shall no more <HI>Marry,</HI> so neither shall they need <HI>Food</HI> or <HI>Raiment</HI> for the Body. But while this <HI>Trea∣sure</HI> (the Gospel Ministration) is in <HI>Earthen Vessels;</HI> and Spirits in Flesh, of as many necessities and bodily wants as their Nei'bours, are imploy'd in these holy Services for your Souls, there must be a laudable Provision for their Bodies and Families, or they must be left desolate and <HI>Comfortless.</HI> There can be no Comfort to be sure in <HI>Pinching</HI> and Starving Circumstances, in <HI>Rags</HI> and Naked∣ness, in the <HI>Cryes</HI> of hungry Children, or in the prospect of meaness and want for their Families after them. If it was Infamous in <HI>Jeroboam</HI> to make Priests of the <HI>Lowest of the People,</HI> 'twill be no less in us to degrade the <HI>Sacred Order</HI> to the <HI>lowest,</HI> by one <HI>Method</HI> or another, whether by Maintaining
<PB N="13" REF="001346_0016_0FB2C73640B9DE08"/>the Ministry so <HI>Meanly</HI> that none but the <HI>Lowest</HI> will come into it; or if they do, that according to humane prospect they shall be sure to have their Families among the <HI>least in Israel.</HI> [Which were as if all the <HI>Sons of Aaron</HI> were for ever to inherit the Curse of <HI>Eli's House, crouching for a piece of Silver and a Morsel of Bread, and saying, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the Priests Offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</HI>]</P>
<P>Had I time I should here have added, <HI>that</HI> the Ministry alone is <HI>a sufficient Care and Labour for the whole Life: that</HI> our whole Time &amp; Strength is too little for it to discharge it faithfully: <HI>that</HI> we need no <HI>Avocations</HI> or hindrances from the wants of Fa∣milies, or from Worldly Secular Businesses: <HI>That</HI> the Office is <HI>Generous</HI> &amp; Noble, as well as the Work Great and Heavy: <HI>that</HI> the <HI>Minds</HI> imploy'd in this Sublime and Holy Service shou'd be suppos'd <HI>Supe∣rior,</HI> and improved by a Learned Education: <HI>that</HI> their <HI>Rank</HI> and Place among men has always been next to the Civil Magistrate; and this not only by the <HI>Custom</HI> of all Nations, but by the <HI>Grant</HI> of God Himself, and therefore it is not of meer <HI>Cour∣tesy,</HI> but of <HI>Right</HI> and Natural Decency: <HI>that</HI> where there has been any <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> whether of Gods Ordination among the <HI>Jews,</HI> or of Humane Establishment (we say) among <HI>Christian Nations,</HI> not to name the <HI>Orders</HI> of old in the Idolatrous <HI>Heathen</HI> World; I say, where-ever any <HI>Hierarchy</HI> has been set up in the World, distinguishing the <HI>Clergy</HI> into divers Orders &amp; <HI>Degrees,</HI> the Superiour Order has been ever grac'd in the first <HI>Rank of No∣bles:</HI> I might add, <HI>That</HI> the Ministerial Work is
<PB N="14" REF="001346_0017_0FB2C737B8D20540"/>not to be levell'd wich <HI>Mechanic</HI> Labours, <HI>Mer∣chandize,</HI> nor other more <HI>Liberal</HI> Imployments nei∣ther; the Practice of <HI>Physick,</HI> or the teaching of <HI>Phylosophy,</HI> not excepted: [To acknowledge which is but a meet Respect to the <HI>Great God,</HI> in whose immediate Service we are; as also 'tis but a decent respect to our own <HI>Souls,</HI> for the Improv∣ment of which in Spiritual Knowledge, their Per∣fection, Conversion &amp; Salvation, we are imployed; And surely, <HI>to teach the Good Knowledge of the Lord</HI> is of more Excellency &amp; Use, than to be <HI>Professors</HI> of any <HI>Secular Science,</HI> ignorant of which we may live and dy and yet be Saved.] Now if the Of∣fice be so Superior, the Maintenance shou'd be also Honourable, or it is very Indecent and Un∣sightly.</P>
<P>I must needs add one thing more here: That the want of a Comfortable Support for the Mini∣sters of the Gospel is <HI>a great Wrong to Souls.</HI> It is so very often to the Souls of your <HI>Ministers:</HI> they can't be so faithful as they desire to be. I have heard some of our <HI>Reverend Brethrer</HI> complain of this with great Affliction, "That they have not Time to <HI>Study</HI> as they wou'd, "That they can't make the <HI>Pastoral Visits</HI> which they gladly wou'd to the Families under their Watch; because their own Families being Numerous, and their income Small, they must spend a great part of the Week in Secular Affairs. Thus they are bereaved of the Comfort of the Sense of having done their Duty to your Immortal Souls. <HI>Again,</HI> It is a great In∣jury to the Souls of <HI>People,</HI> the precious Souls of your Families &amp; <HI>Children.</HI> These suffer in Spiritual
<PB N="15" REF="001346_0018_0FB2C739615153D0"/>respects, by Ministers suffering in temporal things: They are not so <HI>fed</HI> and <HI>watch'd</HI> over as else they might be: <HI>And so in pinching their faithful Pastors, People do eventually Starve the Souls of their Households.</HI></P>
<P>To Conclude, I know not how the <HI>Publick can be Innocent,</HI> if <HI>Lawgiver;</HI> do not make a just Provi∣sion for the Maintenance of the Ministry: In a great part they must expect to answer to God for the Neglect there is in the <HI>Land</HI> as to the Care of Souls; and if Religion and Learning be lost, and our Souls after them, it will be in a great measure owing to this, <HI>That we have not hearts big eno' to part with a few Carnal things to Save all.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>And Lastly,</HI> The Comfort of Gods Faithful Ministers does very much depend on the Provision of a sufficient Body of Laws, <HI>with respect unto Peoples Morals.</HI> This is a very wide and extensive <HI>Head;</HI> Namely, the Sobriety &amp; Righteousness, Purity and Blamelessness of People in Word and Action, in their whole Conduct and Behaviour, in every Re∣lation and Circumstance of Life. The Religion of a People appears in Practice, in Obedience to the <HI>Moral Law.</HI> If this is religiously observed, if men lead Sober, Righteous and Godly Lives, then have Ministers the Consolation of their Labours, then have they not <HI>spent their Strength for nought and in vain;</HI> but they behold the fruits of the Grace of God in their Hearers hearts, <HI>shown out of a Good Conversation:</HI> Then is the Gospel of <HI>God our Savi∣our</HI> visibly Adorned, and your <HI>Apostolick Pastors</HI> have <HI>no greater Joy.</HI></P>
<P>But if the Laws of a <HI>Land</HI> do not provide against all <HI>Scandalous Immoralities,</HI> Rulers do not speak
<PB N="16" REF="001346_0019_0FB2C73ADFA040A0"/><HI>Comfortably</HI> to any that have the least Respect for Religion: they are grieved, scandaliz'd, offended at bold and lawless Vice defying our Holy Reli∣gion: their righteous Souls are <HI>vexed</HI> at the filthy unrestrained Conversation of the Wicked. 'Tis true, God will set a <HI>Mark</HI> on them that weep in Secret for the open Sins of others, but by Man they are not <HI>Comforted.</HI> How cou'd our <HI>Faces</HI> and Hearts be otherwise than <HI>Sad,</HI> if there were not Good Laws for the Suppressing and Punishing all kinds of open <HI>Profaness,</HI> or seeret <HI>Frauds</HI> and disho∣nesty, <HI>Impurities</HI> and Lusts. Our <HI>Comfort</HI> greatly depends on the <HI>Laws</HI> in force, and from time to time <HI>Enacted,</HI> against Blasphemy, Cursing and Swearing, Sabbath-breaking, Undutifulness of Children and Servants, Seditions, Murders, Perni∣cious Strifes, Uncleanness, Drunkenness, Thefts, Abuses of our Nei'bours Good Name, and what∣ever Moral <HI>Turpitude</HI> there is to pollute a Land and <HI>corrupt Good Manners.</HI></P>
<P>And next to the good <HI>Laws</HI> in force among us against such <HI>Scandals,</HI> we have no greater Comfort than the <HI>Royal</HI> PROCLAMATIONS that have been issued out from the <HI>Throne, For the Encourage∣ment of Piety and Vertue, and for the Preventing and Punishing of Vice, Profaness and Immorality.</HI> In this the Magistrate is the <HI>Minister of God unto us for Good,</HI> a <HI>Terror</HI> to the <HI>Evil,</HI> and a <HI>Praise</HI> to the <HI>Good. Rom.</HI> xiii. 3, 4. He is by Office, as has been often said, <HI>Custos utriusque Tabuloe,</HI> the <HI>Defender</HI> of both the <HI>Tables</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Faith.</HI> He succeeds in <HI>Moses</HI> Place, who having received the Law from God, then saw to it that the People kept it.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="001346_0020_0FB2C73C49128668"/>
I have done with the <HI>first thing</HI> wherein Civil Rulers are to endeavour the Comfort of those that teach the good Knowledge of the LORD, <HI>Namely, In their Legislative power and trust,</HI> by <HI>Enacting</HI> good Laws for the Honour and Establishment of Religion within their Government. I will be more <HI>brief</HI> in the other <HI>Instances.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. It belongs to <HI>Rulers,</HI> and all <HI>Publick Officers, Superior or Inferior,</HI> in their <HI>Executive</HI> trust &amp; power, to Comfort all those that stand up for GOD or are more immediately related to his Service, by the <HI>Faithful Execution of those good Laws, that relate to Religion,</HI> the Honour of God, the Observation of the Divine Law, and the Prosperity of the <HI>Church of Christ.</HI> We have <HI>Good Laws</HI> against Immorali∣ties and Contempt of the Divine Ordinances; herein the <HI>Legislative Power</HI> have endeavour'd our Comfort: It now and always lies with the <HI>Honou∣rable Judges,</HI> the <HI>Worshipful Gentlemen in Commission for the Peace,</HI> with <HI>Inferior Officers</HI> in every degree of Power or Trust, to the faithful discharge of which Respective Trusts they are <HI>Sworn</HI> and under the <HI>Oath of God,</HI> as <HI>Revengers to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil:</HI> without which the Magistrate does at last <HI>hold the Sword in vain,</HI> and the <HI>Penalties</HI> threatned in the Law prove an <HI>Empty Noise</HI> and a <HI>Lye. Laws</HI> not duly Executed are but <HI>Powder without Ball;</HI> there's a terrible <HI>blaze</HI> and sound but no <HI>Execution</HI> done: the <HI>Wicked</HI> have no Terror from them, nor the <HI>Good</HI> any Comfort.</P>
<P>More especially the <HI>Ministry</HI> wearing no <HI>Secu∣lar Arms</HI> for their own. Defence, they <HI>are more
<PB N="18" REF="001346_0021_0FB2C73DF7BEE3A8"/>Peculiarly the Care of the Civil Sword,</HI> to protect them from all Open Wrongs and Affronts; the wicked in the World being ready to trample them in the dust, and with-hold their <HI>Legal Rights:</HI> And the more <HI>backward</HI> they are to <HI>Assert</HI> 'em, and fill their Superiors Ears with <HI>Complaints;</HI> of <HI>Them</HI> especially to whose Service in Spiritual Respects they are devoted; in this case the Magistrate shou'd not always <HI>wait for a formal Complaint,</HI> but find a Tongue for the <HI>Dumb</HI> and an Arm for the <HI>Meek,</HI> be Eyes to the <HI>Blind,</HI> and Feet to the <HI>Lame,</HI> and <HI>Search out the Cause</HI> Himself. For there is a <HI>Modesty in Superior Minds</HI> which restrains them from Com∣plaints and causes 'em <HI>rather to suffer wrong:</HI> And there is a Regard to Mens Souls in many of Gods Servants so Superior to their Care about their own Temporal Concerns, <HI>Seeking not theirs but them,</HI> that they had rather Silently Suffer at home than their holy Ministrations shou'd suffer with unrea∣sonable men abroad.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>And Lastly,</HI> Much is Incumbent on Civil Rulers for the Comfort and Encouragement of the Ministry, <HI>in a Personal and more Private Character, as Christians of a Superiour Degree only.</HI> And under this Consideration of Themselves, they shou'd hold Themselves obliged to comfort the faithful Teach∣ers of the good Knowledge of the Lord.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>In taking care to give a Vertuous and Religious Example in their own Conversation, both Private and Publick.</HI> Authority and Dignity carries so much of the Stamp and Image of God upon it, that tho' it receives its highest Grace and Lustre from Re∣ligion,
<PB N="19" REF="001346_0022_0FB2C73FF1076828"/>yet to the Eyes of Inferiors it reflects back also a great honour on Religion, and the Doctrine of God our Saviour is Eminently Adorn'd thereby. 'Tis a Comfortable thing to see Those, of whom it is said, <HI>Ye are gods,</HI> paying the profoundest Ve∣neration and Homage to the Great GOD <HI>by whom they Rule;</HI> and they that give Laws to others paying Themselves the most careful Obedience to the Divine Law.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> when we come into your <HI>Presence,</HI> your Wife and Grave, your Pure and Devout <HI>Discourse</HI> may be long remembred with Reverence.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> the Vertue and <HI>Order</HI> of your Families, may like that of <HI>Joshua</HI> and <HI>David</HI> show the whole Land what the Fear of the Lord is.</P>
<P><HI>That</HI> the Religious Sanctification of the <HI>Sabbath</HI> by your Housholds, and your constant reverent Attendance on the <HI>Private and Publick Worship</HI> of God, may visible testify your respect and honour to Gods holy Institutions.</P>
<P>For which End I cannot but wish, and with the lowest Deference wou'd earnestly commend it to the Consciences of Some whom I greatly honour in their Civil Character, <HI>That all our Rulers might stand compleat in their Christian Profession:</HI> And while they fill our Conspicuous <HI>Seats</HI> at the <HI>Council Board,</HI> in <HI>Courts of Justice,</HI> and in the <HI>Assemblies</HI> for Wor∣ship, their <HI>Place</HI> might not be left empty at <HI>the Table of Christ:</HI> An Example that must needs hurt our Churches, and the Souls of the <HI>Vulgar,</HI> from <HI>Persons</HI> of your Knowledge, Gravity, and believed Piety.</P>
<P>Magistrates shou'd be among the first at the Temple, and there and every where their <HI>Lights</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="001346_0023_0FB2C741858E87F8"/>shou'd <HI>Shine before Men;</HI> Not in the vain Spirit of <HI>John,</HI> who sought <HI>Fame</HI> from a <HI>false Blaze, Come, see my Zeal for the Lord:</HI> [Tho' it must be said, that it is as <HI>Impolitick</HI> as it is profane for Rulers to live in Irreligious Courses: And yet a meer <HI>Mask</HI> of Religion is a <HI>Mean Disguize,</HI> as well as <HI>horrid;</HI> to seek to establish our Power by abusing &amp; affront∣ing the Glorious and Fearful Name of God.]</P>
<P N="2">2. It beseems the Christian Magistrate to speak Comfortably to the faithful Ministers of Christ, <HI>by giving open Respects and Honours to their Persons, treating one always with distinction before the People.</HI> As <HI>Fathers,</HI> says the <HI>Apostie;</HI> as <HI>Children,</HI> tho't the good King <HI>Hezekiah, Chap.</HI> xxix. <HI>v.</HI> 11. <HI>My Sons,</HI> said he to the <HI>Levites,</HI> My Sons, <HI>be not negligent.</HI> And it is Remarkable with what Affability, Friend∣ship and Love the <HI>Pious Kings of Israel</HI> were wont to treat the <HI>Prophets of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>A pious Ruler will never be a Stranger to his faithful <HI>Pastor,</HI> if it be not <HI>his</HI> own Will and Fault, which is not to be supposed neither. [Nor is it the single Comfort of a Venerable Superiors Res∣pects, that we have in the Friendship of a Pious Ruler; but as <HI>King Saul</HI> himself once askt of the <HI>Prophet,</HI> it honours us before the People, and most effectually teaches them to venerate their <HI>Teachers.</HI></P>
<P>Certainly our <HI>Gracious</HI> QUEEN has taught all in <HI>Subordinate Place</HI> their true Honour and Duty, promising in Her <HI>Proclamation</HI> against Vice, a <HI>Distinction in Her Royal Favour to Persons of Piety and Vertue.</HI> No Earthly <HI>Prince</HI> can go by a more per∣fect Rule, than this by which GOD governs His own Regards, which is <HI>His Own Moral Image and Grace.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="21" REF="001346_0024_0FB2C74729EDDB30"/>
3. It is expected of the Civil Ruler to speak Comfortably to those that teach the good Know∣ledge of God, <HI>by excelling others in a chearful Readi∣ness to Support the Divine Worship with their outward Estate.</HI> 'Tis supposed, that generally they are distinguish'd by Providence with <HI>Riches</HI> as well as Honour and Power; and if so, they are <HI>Poor Com∣forts</HI> at last to their Respective Churches if they do not <HI>lead in a Generous Contributing</HI> to the Mainte∣nance of the Ministry. If a rich Magistrate is seen to <HI>Pinch,</HI> what will not others do, who are of Estate as mean as their Quality? When the Building of the <HI>Temple</HI> was to be provided for, <HI>King David</HI> first exhausted his own <HI>Royal Treasures,</HI> and then the People gave largely. This also was one way wherein <HI>Hezekiah</HI> spake so comfortably to the <HI>Levites</HI> and the <HI>Priesthood, v.</HI> 24. He gave <HI>a Thousand Bullocks and Seven Thousand Sheep, and the Princes gave a Thousand Bullocks, and Ten Thousand Sheep, and a great number of Priests Sanctify'd them∣selves:</HI> And in the xxxi. <HI>Chap.</HI> 3. <HI>v.</HI> we read fur∣ther, that <HI>Hezekiah appointed the Kings portion of his Substance for the Burnt-Offering.</HI></P>
<P>God has honour'd Rulers above others, and He expects that they do more than others to honour Him. Where He gives Riches in Abundance, He looks that Men do proportionably cast into his <HI>Treasury</HI> out of their Abundance; or else let the <HI>Poor Widow</HI> throw in her <HI>Single Mite,</HI> and Heaven will account that she has <HI>done more than all</HI> the Great and the Rich.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="001346_0025_0FB2C749024E87C8"/>
Having urg'd You so far, I will not Suppress two Tho'ts more, wherein the <HI>Rich and Honourable</HI> may greatly comfort the Churches &amp; Ministry of Christ. The <HI>One</HI> is, <HI>By devoting a Select Son</HI> to the Service of the Temple, &amp; leaving him an Inheritance equal with his <HI>Brethren.</HI> The <HI>Other</HI> is, That you wou'd employ some suitable parts of your <HI>Estates</HI> as a <HI>Tri∣bute</HI> to God and his Ministry in <HI>Founding, Endowing, Establishing</HI> and <HI>Securing Schools for Literature and Re∣ligion:</HI> More especially, our fair and lov'd <HI>Mother</HI> the COLLEDGE, which <HI>Happy Foundation</HI> God has signally bless'd and made the Great Glory of the <HI>Land;</HI> filling every <HI>Chair of Honour</HI> almost with her <HI>Worthy Sons.</HI> The flourishing of that <HI>Society</HI> is the Great Joy and Comfort of the <HI>Ministry</HI> and so is the present <HI>happy Settlement</HI> thereof, as was abun∣dantly testify'd to the <HI>Honourable</HI> COURT in the <HI>united Addresses</HI> of the <HI>Ministers</HI> the <HI>last year.</HI> And whatever it shall please God to direct the GREAT and GENERAL COURT further to do, in their present <HI>Session</HI> or hereafter, for the <HI>Security</HI> of that <HI>Body</HI> and the more Honourable Support of the <HI>Reverend President,</HI> it will greatly comfort the hearts of the present <HI>Ministry:</HI> So great a part of Whom must always own Him, with great Reverence and Love, a Wise and Careful <HI>Eather</HI> to them, in their happy Education under his <HI>Immediate Inspection and In∣stitution.</HI></P>
<P>I have done with the <HI>First Enquiry,</HI> and it may be, almost presum'd too far on your Candour and Indulgence in some particulars; wherein at last I wou'd by no means be understood to pretend to direct my <HI>Superiours.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="001346_0026_0FB2C74A86408E30"/>
I will not enter on the <HI>Second</HI> thing propound∣ed, left I trespass Egregiously on your Patience, Namely.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>To give the Reasons of the Doctrine,</HI> or to prove it to be the Rulers Incumbent Duty, to Comfort and Encourage the faithful Ministers of <HI>Christ</HI> in their holy Work. The <HI>Word</HI> of God <HI>requires</HI> this of Magistrates, [censures the wont of it, and brands those <HI>Reigns</HI> wherein Religion was not cared for, perverted, depraved, and the <HI>Prophets</HI> ill treated.] Ministers <HI>need</HI> this Comfort and Help in their hard &amp; difficult Work, [to oppose mens Lusts, &amp; bear up under the double measure of Trouble that falls to their share.] The <HI>Efficacy</HI> and. Success of the Ministerial Labours does under God very much depend on the Rulers Countenance and Influence. The <HI>Nature of Magistracy</HI> speaks it to be the Rulers incumbent Duty to encourage the <HI>Ministry</HI> of God, being the <HI>Ordinance of God,</HI> to rule and judge for Him, and accountable to Him, the Supream Go∣vernour and Judge of all the Earth. Not to add, that a Land has no more faithful <HI>Friends</HI> and richer <HI>Blessings</HI> in it, than the faithful Ministers of Christ: Nor the Magistracy any <HI>surer Support</HI> than the En∣couragement of Religion; their Power being from God, the Reverence of Whom once failing the foundation of Government is ras'd.</P>
<P>But I hasten to some brief &amp; particular <HI>Appli∣cation</HI> of the <HI>Doctrine</HI> And the <HI>USE</HI> may be in a <HI>threefold Address.</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To our Honoured <HI>Magistrates.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To <HI>Ministers.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To the <HI>People.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="24" REF="001346_0027_0FB2C74BF6ADD550"/>
1. <HI>It addresses to our, Civil Rulers, that Religion may always have this Countenance and Comfort from them.</HI></P>
<P>We cannot but own the Piety of our Rulers in their open and avowed Respects unto the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the holy <HI>Pastors</HI> of them. We give thanks to God, for the Great Comfort we have in the <HI>Devotion</HI> and bright <HI>Vertue</HI> of many of our <HI>Magistrates;</HI> for the Good <HI>Laws</HI> we have in defence of the Faith and Worship of <HI>Christ;</HI> and against Scandalous Immoralities; and that the <HI>Seats of Judgment</HI> are fill'd with Men of known Integrity and Religious Zeal.</P>
<P>We have Great <HI>Consolation</HI> in <HI>His</HI> EXCELLEN∣CIES <HI>Noble Example;</HI> His Wise, Grave, and Occa∣sionally Religious Conversation; the visible Order and Devotion of his House, and his tender Father∣ly Carriage, toward the <HI>Ministers of Christ;</HI> Of the Body of <HI>Whom</HI> I have this most sure and certain Knowledge, that they are greatly comforted in Him.</P>
<P>In the Times of the <HI>Romish</HI> Superstition, I am told, it was the first Proposal or Enquiry at the opening of the <HI>Parliament, What more is to be done for the Holy Mother the Church?</HI> Far be it, that in our happyer Days of <HI>Reform'd Religion,</HI> the Ministry and <HI>Pure</HI> Worship of God shou'd have less of the <HI>Le∣gislators</HI> Care. Suffer me then to pray that the Comfort of these Churches may always lye near Your hearts, and have some Consideration with You in every Session.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="001346_0028_0FB2C74DDB906580"/>
More especially, the more Honourable Support of <HI>Ministers</HI> thro' the Land wou'd be one most worthy Care of the <HI>Assembly.</HI> I speak not from Want, or for any <HI>Self-Interest,</HI> being by the good Providence of God, and the Care of my <HI>Beloved Church,</HI> equal in <HI>Salary</HI> with any of my <HI>Brethren:</HI> But I speak from a tender feeling of the <HI>Slender</HI> Circumstances of Many (my <HI>Betters</HI>) in other Places; and from an easy fore-sight of the Detri∣ment that must come unto our Churches, if there be not an Inlargement in the Maintenance of the Ministry in most Places. For as this is in the People a too palpable Evidence of a <HI>Lean</HI> Profes∣sion, I mean of their not profiting by the Word; So is it the ready way to make lean and <HI>Poor</HI> Preaching, by Starving mens <HI>Parts</HI> &amp; Oppressing their <HI>Graces.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Poverty of the Land is no Objection</HI> against doing more than is done for the <HI>Ministry.</HI> People might do much more and not feel it. Nay it were the way to grow Rich, if we did our Duty in Supporting Honourably the Worship of God. For as it is the <HI>Blessing</HI> of God that maketh rich, so He has told his People that their defrauding Him is their own Impoverishment: <HI>Mal.</HI> iii. 8, 9, 10. <HI>Ye have robbed ME, — in Tithes and Offerings: Ye are cursed with a curse. — Bring ye all the Tithes into the Store-house, that there may be meat in my House, and prove me now here-with, saith the LORD of Hosts, if I will not open you the Windows of Heaven, and pour you out a Blessing, that there shall not be room eno' to re∣ceive it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="001346_0029_0FB2C7523825FE30"/>
Again, <HI>There is no fear of the Idleness, Pride or Luxury of the Clergy,</HI> from that decent and just Maintenance I am pleading for. I plead for no Sumptuousness or Excess, but bare Convenience. And if Professors of the Gospel are against this, their Devotion is too much like what the <HI>Fable</HI> tells of the <HI>Illiberal Bishops</HI> Blessing, not amounting in real Value unto the price of a <HI>Farthing.</HI></P>
<P>We ought with Thankfulness to acknowledge the Piety of the <HI>Government,</HI> in the good Provision made to Pay out of the <HI>Publick Treasury</HI> the <HI>Dues</HI> of Ministers wrongfully detained from them; and to Tax the respective <HI>Towns</HI> or <HI>Precincts</HI> in propor∣tion: And we may lay it down for a <HI>Rule</HI> to us, that the Ministry can never be Comfortable, while in the Settlement of <HI>Ministers</HI> there continues a necessity of <HI>driving Sordid Bargains about a Salary,</HI> or while after settlement they are forc'd either <HI>abjectly to beg</HI> and entreat, or <HI>resolutely to scuffle</HI> and fight for their Dues by solemn Engagements.</P>
<P>I shall not need to address You again about the <HI>Colledge;</HI> to speak comfortably always to <HI>the Sons of the Prophets at Bethel,</HI> which has indeed been to Us as <HI>the House of GOD and the Gate of Heaven,</HI> for the Heavenly <HI>Issues</HI> thence, which have refreshed the City of our God.</P>
<P>I will rather mention with great Honour the present Care that the <HI>Governmen</HI> is shewing, with respect unto the <HI>Miserable Places of dark∣ness and Irreligion,</HI> that have hitherto <HI>Shut out</HI> the Ministry and Ordinances of <HI>Christ</HI> from among them, counting themselves unworthy of Eternal Life, Your Desires and Labours after a <HI>Mission</HI> of
<PB N="27" REF="001346_0030_0FB2C75431B280F0"/>some Worthy <HI>Persons</HI> into such perishing Places; and for their Honourable Support in such difficult <HI>Posts,</HI> do greatly comfort us, and we Pray the <HI>Great</HI> LORD <HI>of the Harvest</HI> to prosper You, and to <HI>send forth Labourers into his Harvest.</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>Finally,</HI> Need I again <HI>Exhort You, Much Honoured, to be Religious Your Selves,</HI> to fear the GOD by whom You rule, and to Serve Him who honours You among His People? You must needs think Your Selves Obliged to shine before Us, in all Vertue, in Devotion, in Faith, in Zeal; in a Publick respect to the Institutions of Christi∣anity, and in an Abhorrence of all Immoral Practi∣ces; more especially let me say, of <HI>Frauds</HI> and dishonesty, of nauseous <HI>Drunkenness,</HI> of <HI>Sabbath∣breaking,</HI> of <HI>Unnatural Strifes</HI> in Churches, and the <HI>Contemptuous Spites of many against their holy Pastors.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. My next Address is unto <HI>my Reverend Fathers and Brethren in the</HI> MINISTRY. If it be our <HI>Ru∣lers</HI> Duty and Piety to comfort <HI>Us,</HI> we must needs think it <HI>Our Own,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To endeavour in our Places to comfort our Faith∣ful Rulers.</HI> The Obligation is certainly mutual, and 'tis but a grateful Return unto the <HI>Good and Gentle,</HI> nay a Duty even to the <HI>Froward.</HI> There∣fore let us fervently <HI>Pray</HI> for our Rulers, which is <HI>Good and Acceptable in the sight of God our Saviour.</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 1, 2, 3. Let us be <HI>Examples to our Flocks of Loyalty,</HI> Humility, Peaceableness, Meekness, Love, Honour, Obedience and Submission in all just Cases: that if we are at any time falsly Accused, we may be able with Truth &amp; Assurance to make
<PB N="28" REF="001346_0031_0FB2C7562EA7D518"/>the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s Noble Defence, <HI>Act.</HI> xxv. 8. <HI>Neither against the Law, nor the Temple, nor yet against</HI> CESAR <HI>have I offended any thing at all.</HI> Finally, let us be <HI>Just to do our Rulers Honour</HI> wherein they do well; owning it with Pleasure, and blessing God for it; influencing our respective <HI>Charges</HI> to do so like∣wise. We have no Liberty to grieve or disrest them, if They are bound to speak comfortable to <HI>as.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Let us be comforted in the Countenance of our Rulers.</HI> This is a Duty also which we owe unto GOD and <HI>Them.</HI> Let us take the Comfort which God gives us; <HI>This also is the Gift of God.</HI> We have our <HI>precious Opportunities</HI> of Service: We enjoy great <HI>Quietness;</HI> and may be <HI>as Good</HI> and <HI>do</HI> as much good as we will, and have <HI>Praise</HI> of the <HI>Powers that are:</HI> This shou'd make us the <HI>Easier</HI> under our Difficulties, and the more <HI>Chearful</HI> in our Work. So were the <HI>Levites</HI> whom <HI>Hezekiah</HI> comforted, <HI>v.</HI> 25. <HI>The Priests,—the Levites,—and all the Congregation—rejoyced. So there was great Joy in Jerusalem.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. If it is the Duty of the Civil Ruler to speak comfortably to the <HI>Ministry of Christ,</HI> Then cer∣tainly <HI>it is the Duty of Ministers to comfort one ano∣ther.</HI> You must needs confess this <HI>Inference</HI> to be very <HI>Just and Natural,</HI> and alas! it is no less <HI>Ne∣cessary.</HI> We do not comfort and assist one another thro' this <HI>Land</HI> as we ought: Some thro' <HI>Negligence,</HI> some thro' <HI>Disaffection, prejudices,</HI> and <HI>divers Inter∣ests.</HI> Our <HI>Independency</HI> in this sense, is our <HI>Woe</HI> already, and will be our <HI>Ruine</HI> if it be not remedy∣ed, We shou'd <HI>Uni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Strength if we wou'd not
<PB N="29" REF="001346_0032_0FB2C757397C6670"/>be <HI>Feeble:</HI> By <HI>Separateness</HI> we are <HI>broken</HI> one of a∣nother. We shou'd <HI>Visit</HI> one another oft'ner, and be more <HI>Open</HI> and very <HI>safe</HI> in Communicating our Tho'ts to one another. We shou'd tenderly <HI>Sym∣pathize</HI> with one another under Difficulties, and be ready to <HI>Succour</HI> under Wrongs. We shou'd freely <HI>Advise</HI> and <HI>Hearten</HI> one another when Ag∣grieved, and above all men <HI>Bear</HI> with and <HI>Forgive</HI> one another, and he that is <HI>Chief</HI> shou'd be <HI>Servant</HI> of all. We shou'd rejoyce in one anothers <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Graces, Credit</HI> and <HI>Esteem, Use</HI> and <HI>Serviceable∣ness;</HI> and whether we think the same thing in Smaller points of <HI>Church Order,</HI> yet ought we to appear <HI>One</HI> in <HI>Faith,</HI> in <HI>Charity,</HI> &amp; <HI>Zeal</HI> for practical Holiness. Finally, we shou'd beware of the Evil Spirit of <HI>Credulity</HI> against <HI>Elders,</HI> lightly taking up Accusations against <HI>them;</HI> but let our Religious Zeal be under the Restraints of the Law of Charity.</P>
<P N="3">III. I will <HI>Conclude,</HI> with a brief <HI>Exhortation to the People.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To Imitate their Good Rulers,</HI> wherein They are Exemplary in their Regards to the <HI>Ministry of Christ. Inferiour People</HI> must needs hold them∣selves obliged in their Places to be <HI>Comforts</HI> to their <HI>Ministers,</HI> since the <HI>Highest Orders</HI> of Men are bound to be so. Wherefore People ought conscientiously to <HI>Love their Ministers,</HI> to <HI>Pray</HI> for 'em, to assist and <HI>Support</HI> 'em. They shou'd be very Careful not to <HI>grieve</HI> 'em, <HI>contemn</HI> or <HI>wrong</HI> 'em, in <HI>Word</HI> or <HI>Deed.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Obey the just and wise Laws made for the Com∣fort of the Ministry.</HI> As for <HI>Instance,</HI> Do but be <HI>Just</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="001346_0033_0FB2C7591F26BB40"/>to your <HI>Agreements</HI> with your <HI>Ministers.</HI> If we cou'd but obtain this in many Places of the <HI>Land,</HI> it were a Great Point. Yet shou'd <HI>Christians</HI> blush to need this <HI>Exhortation.</HI> Read how the <HI>People of Judah</HI> obey'd the Command of the <HI>King</HI> in giving the <HI>Levites</HI> chearfully their <HI>Portion:</HI> xxxi. <HI>Chap.</HI> 5, 6. <HI>verses. As soon as the Commandment came abroad, the Children of Israel bro't in Abundance the First-fruits of Corn, Wine and Oyl, and Honey, and of all the In∣crease of the Field, and the Tithe of all things bro't they in Abundantly: — the Tithe of Holy things, which were Consecrated unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Let People learn from our <HI>Doctrine,</HI> to know <HI>their own Happiness</HI> when they have <HI>Rulers</HI> that set Themselves to Encourage the <HI>Ministry</HI> and Service of God. None but a <HI>Sanballat</HI> or <HI>Tobiah</HI> can be grieved at it, to see the <HI>Civil Ruler</HI> seeking the <HI>Welfare of Israel.</HI> It shou'd raise our Value, Esteem and Love, and put us on doubling our Prayers for, and our Endeavours to comfort Such <HI>Rulers.</HI> The <HI>Good Job</HI> was such a <HI>Ruler; He chose out their Way, and sat Chief, and dwelt as a King in the Army; as one that Comforteth the Mourners:</HI> and he tells us how it endear'd him to his People: <HI>Job</HI> xxix. 23, 24. <HI>They waited for me as for the Rain, and they op'ned their Mouth wide as for the latter Rain: If I laughed on them they believ'd it not, and the light of my Countenance they cast not down.</HI> They were <HI>refresh'd</HI> by such a Rulers Presence and Countenance, Wisdom and Care, even as the <HI>Thirsty Earth</HI> is by the Showers of <HI>Rain:</HI> They priz'd his <HI>Favour,</HI> and were Solici∣tous <HI>not to lose the light of his Countenance</HI> shining
<PB N="31" REF="001346_0034_0FB2C75E27A78CE0"/>upon them: They <HI>Presum'd not</HI> upon his <HI>Conde∣scentions</HI> to diminish his Authority, and to <HI>blow up∣on</HI> the <HI>Light</HI> that cherish'd 'em: They were care∣ful not to <HI>Grieve</HI> him, to make his <HI>Countenance to fall,</HI> or to make him <HI>Change</HI> his Looks and Carriage toward 'em: <HI>The Light of my Countenance they cast not down.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have endeavour'd to go thro' our re∣spective <HI>Duties</HI> from the <HI>Text,</HI> and now will dismiss the <HI>ASSEMPLY</HI> as the <HI>Levites</HI> did the <HI>Great Congregation of Israel and Judah,</HI> in the <HI>last Verse</HI> of the <HI>Chapter. Then the Priests the Levites arose, and blessed the People: and their Voice was heard, and their Prayer came up to His Holy Dwelling-place, even unto Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Even so <HI>Comfort</HI> the Hearts of your faithful <HI>Pastors,</HI> and you will inherit their <HI>louder and more fervent Blessing:</HI> Their <HI>Invigorated Prayers</HI> for You and your Posterity will come up to the <HI>Holy dwelling-place</HI> of GOD, even unto <HI>Heaven,</HI> obtain∣ing the <HI>Effusion</HI> of every <HI>Sort,</HI> and every <HI>Measure,</HI> of <HI>Spiritual Blessing,</HI> from on <HI>High.</HI></P>
