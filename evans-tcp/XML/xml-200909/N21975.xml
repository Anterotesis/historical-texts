<HEAD>THE MELANCHOLY END OF UNGRATEFUL CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YOU stubborn-hearted children hear,</L>
<L>That slight your aged parents dear,</L>
<L>Draw near a while, with patience wait,</L>
<L>While I this tragedy relate.</L>
<L>No further off than Burkentown,</L>
<L>There liv'd a man of high renown,</L>
<L>Who had a son and daughter bright,</L>
<L>To give himself and wife delight.</L>
<L>The maid was formed beauteous fair,</L>
<L>And female pride engag'd her care,</L>
<L>Neglecting thought of God on high,</L>
<L>She follow'd wordly vanity.</L>
<L>These people did much pains afford,</L>
<L>To make their children love the Lord;</L>
<L>But where God doth not grace bestow,</L>
<L>What can poor feeble mortals do.</L>
<L>At length a certain wealthy man,</L>
<L>To court the lady fair began;</L>
<L>Her parents lik'd the offer well,</L>
<L>As few in riches did excel.</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="028961_0003_0FDDBD14ACF7E2F8"/>
When he had gain'd the maiden's love,</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>state did an objection prove;</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he had not wealth enough to wed,</L>
<L>With one so rich as him, he said.</L>
<L>Her parents gave her all their store,</L>
<L>Save what their son had got before,</L>
<L>That she might marry handsomely,</L>
<L>As her rich lover did agree.</L>
<L>They married were in splendor great,</L>
<L>And settled in a lofty state;</L>
<L>The son and daughter thus did share</L>
<L>That wealth, which was their father's care,</L>
<L>Excepting forty pounds a-year,</L>
<L>Which the old people thought with care</L>
<L>Would serve them both to live upon,</L>
<L>Their son and daughter being gone.</L>
<L>This aged couple, as we hear,</L>
<L>Did afterwards spend many a year</L>
<L><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> pious ways, and godly deeds,</L>
<L>Which from the Christian's heart proceeds.</L>
<L>But oftentimes the Lord on high,</L>
<L>The faith and zeal of saints to try,</L>
<L>Sends trials and afflictive frowns,</L>
<L>And all their flatt'ring hope confounds.</L>
<L>Thus this old couple felt the rod,</L>
<L>Of an all-wise omniscient God;</L>
<L>A dreadful fire in dead of night,</L>
<L>Burnt their possessions in their fight.</L>
<L>Thus stripp'd of all their needed store,</L>
<L>They now became exceeding poor;</L>
<L>Naked, as rising from their bed,</L>
<L>Without their needed clothes they fled.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="028961_0004_0FDD5F291D10CFA8"/>
They on their daughter then did wait,</L>
<L>Told her of their unhappy fate,</L>
<L>Saying, dear child what must we do,</L>
<L>Unless we are secur'd by you.</L>
<L>She with a frown to them did say,</L>
<L>What would you have me do, I pray;</L>
<L>I have got children of my own,</L>
<L>I think I must first look at home.</L>
<L>Wringing their hands, her mother cries</L>
<L>Our nakedness I hope you'll hide:</L>
<L>My aged limbs with cold do quake,</L>
<L>Child pity us for heaven's sake.</L>
<L>She says, you may stay here to-night,</L>
<L>And in the morning when 'tis light,</L>
<L>Your nakedness for once I'll hide,</L>
<L>Then for yourselves you must provide.</L>
<L>And in the morning straight she goes,</L>
<L>And looks some of the cast-off cloaths,</L>
<L>Saying, eat your breakfast, and be gone,</L>
<L>And see that you no more here come.</L>
<L>They at their table must not eat,</L>
<L>But with the servants set at meat;</L>
<L>Still they with patient Job did say,</L>
<L>The Lord that gave did take away;</L>
<L>And therefore we will patient be:</L>
<L>Next to our son we'll go, and see</L>
<L>If he'll receive us in distress,</L>
<L>Oppress'd by age, and comfortless.</L>
<L>They straightway waited on their son,</L>
<L>Who liv'd a mile or two from town,</L>
<L>Saying, dear child some pity shew,</L>
<L>To those who oft have cherish'd you.</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="028961_0005_0FDDBD1AAEF54168"/>
You've heard of our unhappy fate,</L>
<L>How we have been distrest of late,</L>
<L>They wrung their trembling hands and said,</L>
<L>Let us not want in age for bread.</L>
<L>The son he coldly did reply,</L>
<L>I know not what to say, not I,</L>
<L>You can't expect me to maintain</L>
<L>You both cannot long here remain.</L>
<L>They for a fortnight tarried there,</L>
<L>At length the son began to swear,</L>
<L>Saying, you must no longer stay,</L>
<L>Therefore, I tell you, pack away.</L>
<L>The father said unto his wife,</L>
<L>O that the Lord would take our life,</L>
<L>O cruel children, most severe,</L>
<L>Tigers and bears much kinder are.</L>
<L>They hand in hand did wander strait,</L>
<L>Once more unto their daughter's gate,</L>
<L>The servant standing at the door,</L>
<L>Her charity they did implore.</L>
<L>The servant did not know their face,</L>
<L>But to her mistress told the ease,</L>
<L>How a poor aged couple here,</L>
<L>Did ask her for a draught of beer.</L>
<L>Go draw them some the mistress said,</L>
<L>And get them each a piece of bread,</L>
<L>But as she look'd the window through,</L>
<L>She with a frown, said is it you,</L>
<L>Here, stop your hand then she did say,</L>
<L>I shall be plagued thus every day,</L>
<L>Go tell them I will give them none,</L>
<L>And from the gate bid them begone.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="028961_0006_0FDDBD1C282C2248"/>
The servant said there's nothing here,</L>
<L>And from the gate you must repair,</L>
<L>They said go back you damsel dear,</L>
<L>Tell them it is their parents here.</L>
<L>The servant told her what they said,</L>
<L>She in a passion struck her maid,</L>
<L>Saying, go do as you were bid,</L>
<L>And keep disgraceful stories hid.</L>
<L>The servant put them from the door,</L>
<L>They wrung their hands and wept full sore,</L>
<L>Into a barn they then did hie,</L>
<L>In bitter grief, prepar'd to die.</L>
<L>But look not on the story here</L>
<L>As a tale fictious, not sincere,</L>
<L>For in this land it does appear,</L>
<L>There some such graceless children are.</L>
<L>The next morn the old pair were found,</L>
<L>Extended lifeless on the ground,</L>
<L>News to the daughter straitway came,</L>
<L>She laughed when she heard the same.</L>
<L>Their age, and extreme poverty,</L>
<L>It was too troublesome to me,</L>
<L>No more of them I now shall hear,</L>
<L>I from their trouble am set clear.</L>
<L>But soon the heavy hand of God,</L>
<L>Extended his avenging rod,</L>
<L>One day the son a hunting rode,</L>
<L>And soon his horse the rider thow'd.</L>
<L>He broke his neck and instantly</L>
<L>Extended on the ground did die,</L>
<L>His sister heard it, and the fright</L>
<L>Brought a hot fever on that night.</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="028961_0007_0FDDBD1E0B41B2D8"/>
Her senses quickly fled away,</L>
<L>Ten days in tort'ring pain she lay,</L>
<L>And then to death she did resign,</L>
<L>Thus she experienc'd wrath divine.</L>
<L>Great preparations there were made,</L>
<L>Her body should in earth be laid,</L>
<L>But e'er the funeral was, we hear,</L>
<L>Her breath within her did appear.</L>
<L>And lifting up her hands, she cried,</L>
<L>My soul from heaven is deny'd,</L>
<L>Then to the world she did unfold,</L>
<L>What she did in her trance behold.</L>
<L>When my poor soul did strait depart,</L>
<L>I wander'd through a vally dark,</L>
<L>Large briery woods and wat'ry plains,</L>
<L>At length unto a den I came.</L>
<L>Whence issued smoke and dreadful fire,</L>
<L>As made my soul with fear retire,</L>
<L>I saw my only brother there,</L>
<L>Enclos'd in darkness and despair.</L>
<L>He roll'd his tortured eyes on me,</L>
<L>And said 'tis for my cruelty,</L>
<L>I used to my father dear</L>
<L>That I am now confined here.</L>
<L>Then hearing a shrill trumpet sound,</L>
<L>I quickly turn'd myself around,</L>
<L>And saw a glorious place divine,</L>
<L>Where angels did in glory shine.</L>
<L>I saw my loving parents dear,</L>
<L>With golden crowns in glory there,</L>
<L>O parent's dear, I then did say</L>
<L>Take me to that blest place I pray.</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="028961_0008_0FDDBD21813DF288"/>
