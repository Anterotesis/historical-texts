<P><HI>As</HI> FREF, <HI>and not using your</HI> LIBERTY <HI>as a Cloak of</HI> Maliciousness; <HI>but as the Servants of</HI> GOD.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>LIBERTY, evangelical and so∣cial! Jewel of inestimable Price! Thou Blessing, of all Blessings the first! Woo'd and courted by ma∣ny; won and wedded by few! Ever near us; yet often at a distance fan∣cied! Thro' all the <HI>Modes of Faith,</HI> by the SAINT pursued; and, in every <HI>Frame of Government,</HI> by the PATRIOT sought! O thou coelestial GOOD—or rather THOU who art the AUTHOR of all GOOD, terrestrial and coelestial—SUPREME ARCHITECT <HI>of the</HI> UNIVERSE; who, by our great and SPIRI∣TUAL MASTER thy Son, hast taught us the true <HI>Way of Liberty</HI>—the Way of being <HI>free</HI> and <HI>accepted</HI> thro' Him! May I now be en∣lightened
<PB N="6" REF="016526_0006_0F9C8B02E1168908"/>and enlivened by a Ray from THEE, while I endeavour to shew, that the Doctrine delivered in my Text for the En∣joyment and Exercise of <HI>Liberty,</HI> among CHRISTIANS in general, is what the Mem∣bers of this ANCIENT SOCIETY (by whose appointment I appear in this place) have bound themselves by the strongest Obliga∣tions to follow, in the several Relations they sustain; viz.</P>
<P>First, in all their <HI>Meetings and Communi∣cations</HI> with each other.</P>
<P>Secondly, in <HI>Society</HI> at large. And</P>
<P>Thirdly, in <HI>private Life,</HI> as Individuals glowing with the Love of their Spe∣cies; and seeking to promote their Hap∣piness, as far Opportunities can reach, or the wide Wish of Benevolence extend.</P>
<P>Upon these THREE GRAND PILLARS, founded on the adamantine Rock of ETER∣NAL TRUTH, we profess to support the <HI>Fabric of our Labors;</HI> convinced that other Foundation than what the great MASTER-BUILDER hath laid, can no Man lay. Did we presume to depart from this, or propose to cultivate a Science, which hath any thing less for its Object than the Contemplation
<PB N="7" REF="016526_0007_0F9C8B03A0CDF6E8"/>and Imitation of that everlasting <HI>Order, Harmony</HI> and <HI>Proportion</HI> which ("in Mea∣sure, Number and Weight") HE hath established through all his Works; I should consider our Foundations as laid in the <HI>Sand,</HI> and our Superstructures raised of <HI>Stubble.</HI> Whatever Curiosity might have at first prompted me to pry into the Secrets of this Science, the most solemn Obligations could not have engaged my Adherence to it, when found repugnant to antecedent Obligations, which are indispensible, and therefore more solemn.</P>
<P>These were my early <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sermon preach'd on St. John Baptist's Day, 1755.</NOTE> Declarations. Many Years have since roll'd over my Head. That <HI>Seriousness,</HI> which I ever wish'd to maintain on grave and serious Occasions, is now (thro' various Trials and Vicissitudes, public and private) become habitual to me. I would not, therefore, upon this Occasion, or in this sacred Place, rise up to indulge the wanton Sport of Imagination: but my Hope is that, in Discharge of the present Duty assigned me by the <HI>Brotherhood,</HI> I may be in some Degree instrumental, among all who honour us with their Atten∣dance, in that best Office of a Christian Mi∣nister —the rendering GOD more feared and more adored, and <HI>Mankind</HI> more happy and more in Love with each other.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016526_0008_0F9C8B045FA228E8"/>
I proceed, then, to apply the Apostle; Doctrine to my <HI>first Head</HI> of Discourse; and, for that End, it is necessary to recite some preceding Parts of his sublime CHARGE.</P>
<P><Q>Wherefore, says he, laying aside all Malice, and all Guile, and Hypocrisies, and Envies, and all Evil-Speaking—</Q> be ye as <Q><HI>living Stones,</HI> built up a <HI>spiritual House</HI>—as FREE, and not using your LI∣BERTY as a Cloak of Maliciousness, but as the Servants of GOD.</Q></P>
<P>For the better understanding these Words it must be observed that, as in our modern Times; so likewise, from the first Stages of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> its true Purpose, respecting Li∣berty both spiritual and temporal, hath been misunderstood or misinterpreted by many.</P>
<P>From the Power of Bigotry, the Strength of Prejudice, a strange Meanness and unhal∣lowed Frame of Mind; some, who were first called into evangelic Freedom, had still, rooted in their Temper, a beggarly Hanker∣ing after the old abrogated Rites and Cus∣toms, both <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Pagan.</HI></P>
<P>Astonished at this, St. Paul, with his usual Fervor of Eloquence, cries out— <Q>O foolish Galatians! who hath bewitched
<PB N="9" REF="016526_0009_0F9C8B0524D3F2B0"/>you?—After having known God, or ra∣ther are known of Him, how turn ye back to the weak and beggarly Elements, wherewith ye desire again to be united?</Q>—Quit this Folly—be persuaded to <Q>stand fast in the Liberty, wherewith CHRIST has made us FREE; and be not en∣tangled again with the Yoke of Bondage.</Q></P>
<P>Others there were, and still are, in the contrary Extreme; so hardly do Men ever <HI>square</HI> their Conduct by the <HI>golden Rule,</HI> re∣commended in the Text.</P>
<P>Such were many of the early Jewish Con∣verts. The <HI>new Law</HI> of CHRIST, which promised them Liberty from the ancient spiritual Bondage, they interpreted into a Scheme of such unbounded Licentiousness, as dissolved all Obligations even of their own <HI>moral Law,</HI> which, he expressly told them, he "came not to destroy but to fulfil." Affecting to consider themselves as the pe∣culiar Favorites of God, and under his sole Government, they sought an Exemption from the Authorities of this World, and were for trampling under Foot the Powers ordained, or permitted, by him.</P>
<P>Thus, forgetting the <HI>Spirit of the Gospel,</HI> and blown up with the Pride of their <HI>own
<PB N="10" REF="016526_0010_0F9C8B05E1795600"/>Spirit;</HI> they treated with Contempt all whom they considered as Unbelievers, or less righteous than themselves. In <HI>private Life,</HI> they thought that their superior Profes∣sions of Sanctity and furious Zeal would atone for all Sorts of <Q>Malice, Guile, Hy∣pocrisy, Envies and Evil Speaking;</Q> and, in <HI>public Life,</HI> would justify Seditions, Mur∣ders and the Destruction of their Brethren—</P>
<P>Miserable Infatuation! as if the GOD of all <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> could be served, by extirpating from our Hearts not only those native Dictates of <HI>Humanity</HI> which were im∣planted to give us some Degree of Happi∣ness in this World; but those nobler Les∣sons of CHRISTIAN CHARITY, which are our best Preparation for the unbounded Happiness of the World to come!</P>
<P>The Apostle, in my Text, contends ear∣nestly against this sad Mistake; teaching that it leads not to the <HI>Use</HI> but deplorable <HI>Abuse</HI> of <HI>true Liberty;</HI> making it a Covering for every wicked Purpose, and enslaving us more and more to those internal Passions, from which our DIVINE MASTER came to set us FREE.</P>
<P>To the like Purpose are we taught by ano∣ther great and <HI>wise Master.</HI>—"SIX Things,"
<PB N="11" REF="016526_0011_0F9C8B06A189F3E8"/>says <HI>Solomon,</HI><Q>doth the Lord hate; yea, SEVEN are an Abomination to Him, viz.</Q></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>First—<HI>A proud Look.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Second—<HI>A lying Tongue.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Third—<HI>Hands that shed innocent Blood.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Fourth—<HI>A Heart that deviseth wicked Imaginations.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Fifth—<HI>Feet that be swift in running to Mischief.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Sixth—<HI>A false Witness that speaketh Lies.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>Seventh—<HI>Him that soweth Discord among</HI> BRETHREN.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>These <HI>seven Abominations</HI> of Solomon, comprehended also by St. Peter under the general Term <HI>Maliciousness,</HI> must ever be peculiarly hateful to Us, as a SOCIETY OF FRIENDS; linked together by a strong Tie of BROTHERLY LOVE, as well as by every other Tie of RELIGION and Law, for the Advancement of true Humanity, genuine good Humour, undissembled Virtue, rati∣onal Liberty and useful Science.</P>
<P>Indeed the whole Doctrine of the Text (calling us to consider ourselves <Q>as the Ser∣vants of God,</Q> in the Use of every Thing which he offers for our Enjoyment here) must still be necessary among all Societies of Men, in a World wrapt up in false Peace;
<PB N="12" REF="016526_0012_0F9C8B076EBE6288"/>trusting too much to external Professions, and where Multitudes have yet to learn— That TRUE RELIGION is something <HI>spiri∣tual,</HI> and design'd to perfect the Soul in Ho∣liness, thro' the Fear and Love of God— That she must lie deeper than in Ordinan∣ces and Professions— <Q>Must reach the inner Parts, or rather take her Rise there, even in the hidden Man of the Heart, where Christ bruises the Serpent, subdues our natural Corruptions,</Q> erects his Throne within us, and consecrates us Temples of the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P>It is in this Sense only, that Men can be considered as <HI>living Stones, built up a spiritual House!</HI> It is in this Sense only that they can enjoy <HI>Liberty as the Servants of God;</HI> with∣out "Maliciousness," and without Licen∣tiousness!</P>
<P>As to you, Brethren! I hope I need not remind you that if none be <HI>accepted</HI> among us, but such as strive daily, thro' the Grace of Heaven, to lay aside those evil Passions, condemned by the Apostle; then shall the LODGE be truly denominated a "Spiritual House," and all its Members "Living Stones," hewn out of the <HI>Rock of Ages,</HI> and adorned with Jewels of unspeakable Value. Then shall they be <HI>free</HI> indeed! for the
<PB N="13" REF="016526_0013_0F9C8B0820037328"/>great SPIRITUAL MASTER shall have set them <HI>free</HI> from the Turbulence of Passion, the Stings of Guilt and the Thraldom of Slavery, both of Body and Mind. In WISDOM, BEAUTY and STRENGTH shall they ever appear—</P>
<P>That WISDOM which descends from on high— <Q>a pure Influence flowing from the Glory of the Almighty—which is the Brightness of the everlasting Light, the unspotted Mirror of the Power of God, and THE IMAGE OF HIS GOODNESS— more beautiful than the Sun and above all the Order of Stars—pure, peaceable, gentle and easy to be entreated—which whosoever findeth, findeth Life—</Q></P>
<P>That STRENGTH, which depends not on the Arm of Flesh, nor delights in Oppres∣sion and Confusion; but is a Refuge to the Distress'd, a Band of Union among Breth∣ren, and a Source of Comfort in our own Hearts—</P>
<P>That BEAUTY, which shines forth in the <HI>Ornaments</HI> of Holiness, the <HI>Jewels</HI> of Mercy, the <HI>Cloathing</HI> of Humility, and the Practice of all Religious, Moral and Social Duties.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="016526_0014_0F9C8B08E0BDE988"/>
In Conclusion, therefore, to this <HI>first Head</HI> of Discourse; let me, in the Fullness of my pledged Affection, exhort you to remember, in all your <HI>Meetings</HI> and <HI>Communications,</HI> that you are Brethren; although <HI>free,</HI> yet on the <HI>Level;</HI> bound to keep within the <HI>Com∣pass</HI> of mutual Good-Will; and to frame your Conduct by the <HI>Square</HI> of Doing as you would be done by. Keep an open Heart to every suffering Brother, ready to receive him as a Tempest-driven Voyager into a Port of Safety; seeking among you that Relief and Shelter, which he sought in Vain, while toss'd upon the restless Ocean of common Life.</P>
<P>Be of one Mind. Avoid all Levity of Conversation. Be sober and temperate; abstaining from every Excess that would enervate the Body, debase the Understand∣ing, cherish Strife and dishonour your Call∣ing. Study to be quiet, and to do your own Business with your own Hands; as knowing that <Q>a <HI>wise Brother</HI>'s Delight is in the WORK OF HIS CRAFT.</Q> Learn when to be silent, and when to speak; for <Q>a Babbler is an Abomination, because of the <HI>unspeakable Words,</HI> which a <HI>Man</HI> may not utter,</Q> but in a proper Place.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="016526_0015_0F9C8B099F087158"/>
These are fundamental Principles, and Practices of immutable Obligation in our Society. Flowing from the Fountain∣head of Antiquity, they have roll'd down to us, in pure and uncorrupted Streams, through the Channels of Time; and, we trust, will still roll, broader and deeper, until the <HI>dread Order</HI> of this TERRESTRIAL FABRIC shall be consummated in the <HI>endless Order</HI> of ETERNITY. While we draw from such sacred Sources, our true Mem∣bers, as in Times past, so likewise now and in Times to come, in different Climes and Ages, shall be able to silence <Q>the Tribe of Scorners;</Q> and to convince them that the only Qualities we wish to honour are those which form good Men and good Citi∣zens; and the only Buildings we seek to raise, are <HI>Temples for Virtue and Dungeons for Vice.</HI></P>
<P>The other Societies of this World—Em∣pires, Kingdoms and Commonwealths— being of less perfect Constitutions, have been of less permanent Duration. Although Men have busied themselves, thro' all Ages, in <HI>forming</HI> and <HI>reforming</HI> them, in casting down and building up; yet still their La∣bours have been vain! The Reason was—
<PB N="16" REF="016526_0016_0F9C8B0A607F4E30"/>hear it and be wise, ye BUILDERS of the present Day—the Reason was, that THEY <HI>daub'd with untemper'd Mortar,</HI> and admit∣ed into their STRUCTURES the base, dis∣cordant, heterogeneous Materials of Pride, Ambition, Selfishness, <Q>Malice, Guile, Hypocrisies, Envies and Evil Speaking</Q> — which WE reject. Hence their Fabi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, unable to support themselves, tumbled to the Foundation, through internal Weak∣ness, or were shaken to Pieces by external Violence.</P>
<P>The EGYPTIAN, the BABYLONIAN, the ASSYRIAN, the PERSIAN <HI>Empires;</HI> the <HI>Commonwealths</HI> of ATHENS, of SPARTA, and of ROME, with many more of later Date—Where are they now? "FALL'N— FALL'N—FALL'N"—the weeping Voice of History replies! The Meteors of an Age, the Gaze of one Part of the World; they rose—they blaz'd awhile on high—they burst and sunk again, beneath the Horizon, to that Place of Oblivion, where the pale Ghosts of departed Grandeur fleet about in sad Lamentation of their former Glory!</P>
<P>Such have been the Changes and Revolu∣tions which, as a Fraternity, we have been.
<PB N="17" REF="016526_0017_0F9C8B0B21C078F0"/>From the Bosom of the LODGES, (seated on an Eminence) its Foundations reaching the Center and its Summit the Sky; we have beheld, as upon a turbulent Ocean at an immense Distance beneath us, the States of this World alternately mounted up and cast down, as they have regarded or neglected the Principles described above; while, sup∣ported by them, the sublime Fabric of our Constitution has remained unshaken through Ages—and, thus supported, it shall still re∣main, while the Sun opens the Day to gild its Cloud-cap'd Towers, or the Moon leads on the Night to chequer its starry Canopy. The Current of Things may roll along its Basis <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A few Sentences which were lest out of the Lon∣don Editions of the Sermon on St. John Baptist's Day, 1755, as relating only to the Society before whom it was preached, are interwoven in this and the 12th Page of the present discourse.</NOTE>; the Tide of Chance and Time may beat against its Walls; the stormy Gusts of Malice may assault its lofty Battlements, and the heavy Rains of Calumny may descend upon its spacious Roof—but all in vain. A Building, thus constructed and supported, is impregnable <HI>from without;</HI> and can then only be dissolved when the <HI>Pillars</HI> of the Universe shall be shaken, and <Q>the great Globe itself, yea all which it inherit,
<PB N="18" REF="016526_0018_0F9C8B0BDFF20E08"/>shall, like the baseless Fabric of a Vision,</Q> pass away before the ALMIGHTY ARCHI∣TECT!</P>
<P>But altho' we have seen those Changes, Convulsions and Dissolutions; we have not seen them with Insensibility, nor without Heart-felt Grief and a sympathetic Tear. And this brings me to my—</P>
<P>SECOND HEAD, which was to shew— That our Love to God and Man leads us to cultivate the same rational and evang lie Use of Liberty in <HI>Society at large,</HI> as in our own subordinate Societies.</P>
<P>This, we know, is a more arduous La∣bor; because the same watchful Care cannot be so easily applied to the Admission, Re∣jection or Government of Members, in large Societies as in small. Nevertheless, if every Man, first in his own House, and then in all those lesser Societies of Brethren with whom he may be connected, would learn, in the Apostle's Use of Liberty, to subdue every evil and discordant Passion; the blessed Ha∣bit would easily be carried forth into Soci∣ety at large. Individual States would not only be happy, durable, and <HI>free</HI> from in∣testine
<PB N="19" REF="016526_0019_0F9C8B0C9F6FE5B8"/>Broils and Convulsions; but <Q>Na∣tion would no more rise against Nation</Q> in dreadful Havoc and Oppression. The whole World would be as ONE HARMONI∣OUS LODGE, knit together in <HI>Brotherly Love,</HI> and obedient to the Will of the great HEAVENLY MASTER!</P>
<P>Such a glorious Aera many believe to be <HI>promised,</HI> and hope it may yet come. Our Principles lead us to cherish this Hope; and, as the best Means, under Providence, for its accomplishment, to resist Violence, and to support Justice, Truth, Freedom and Happiness in the Governments to which we belong.</P>
<P>The Doctrine that <HI>One</HI> Man's Grandeur, or the Grand ur of a <HI>Few,</HI> is to be the Mi∣sery of <HI>All,</HI> can have no reception among us. We can acknowledge no absolute uncon∣troulable power upon Earth; and can form no Conjecture whence such power could come, or be pretended. From GOD, the supreme Fountain of all Power, it could not come; without supposing he granted it to dishonour his own Perfections, deface his Image in his Works, and debase his whole Creation. From MAN it could not come;
<PB N="20" REF="016526_0020_0F9C8B0D60C1A2A8"/>unless we suppose him, voluntarily and in his sober Senses, consenting to his own im∣mediate Misery and Destruction.</P>
<P>In our Estimation, therefore, "no Go∣vernment can be of <HI>divine</HI> Original, but as it resembles God's own Government; round whose eternal Throne, Justice and Mercy wait. And all Governments must be so far <HI>divine,</HI> as the LAWS rule; and every Thing is ordered, under God, by <HI>free and common consent."</HI></P>
<P>To contend for such Governments, with a holy, enlightened, and unquenchable zeal, is the highest temporal Glory. Wherefore, we dwell with Rapture upon the Records of former Renown, and con∣template with Veneration those transcend∣ent Scenes of Heroism; in which we behold the BRAVE 2nd the FREE wearing upon their Swords the Fate of Millions—while the divine GENIUS OF VICTORY, espousing their Cause, hovers o'er their Heads with expanded Wing; reaching forth the immor∣tal Wreath that is to surround their trum∣phant Brow; and smiling upon the <HI>decisive Moment</HI> that is to fix the Happiness of future Generations!</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="016526_0021_0F9C8B0E2088BC40"/>
They who (from a Sense of Duty to God and their Country, seeking that LIBERTY and PEACE which Heaven approves) have thus acted their Part, whether in more ele∣vated or inferior Stations, form the first Class in the Roll of Worthies. And when they descend again into private Life, casting behind them vain Pomp and fastidious Pride, to mingle with their Fellow-Citizens in all the tender Charities and endearing Offices of Society and Humanity; their Characters, if possible, become still more Illustrious. Their very Maims and Scars are nobly Honourable. The Respect which they command, grows with their growing Years; and they approach the Horizon of Life, as the Sun in serene and setting Glory, with Orb more enlarged and mitigated, though less dazzling and splendid. Even their gar∣rulous old Age, while it can only recount the Feats of former Days, will be listened to with Attention: Or should they survive all the active Powers both of Body and Mind, yet still, like some grand Structure, tottering and crumbling beneath the Hand of Time, they will be considered as majes∣tie in Ruins, and venerable even in Decay!</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="016526_0022_0F9C8B0F0600A2E8"/>
And when at last the Messenger DEATH, who comes to all, shall come to them; un∣daunted they will obey the Summons; in conscious Hope of being speedily united and beatified with their Com-patriots and Fore-runnners, in the Mansions of endless Bliss!</P>
<P>Such, to name no more, was the Character of a CINCINNATUS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For some further Account of this illustrious Roman (too long for a Note) see the Appendix. p. 30.</NOTE> in ancient Times; rising "awful from the Plough" to <HI>save his Country;</HI> and, his <HI>Country saved,</HI> return∣ing to the Plough again, with increased Dig∣nity and Lustre. Such too, if we divine aright, will future Ages pronounce to have been the Character of a **********; but you all anticipate me in a Name, which Delicacy forbids me, on this occasion, to mention. Honoured with his Presence as a Brother, you will seek to derive Virtue from his Example; and never let it be said, that any Principles you profess, can render you Deaf to the calls of your Country; but, on the contrary, have animated you with intre∣pidity in the Hour of Danger, and Huma∣nity in the Moments of Triumph.</P>
<P>True <HI>Courage</HI> consists not in any Thing <HI>external to a Man</HI>—in the Trappings of
<PB N="23" REF="016526_0023_0F9C8B101DDBB510"/>Dress, the Parade of Office, the Pride of Looks, a quarrelsome Temper, or loud-sounding Boasts; but in a Soul serenely fix∣ed on Duty, and unconscious of Guilt, as knowing that Death has no Terrors but what he derives from Sin. For it hath been well said on this Subject, that <Q>Fire may as easily be struck out of Ice, as Valour out of Crimes; and he has the chance of most Valour who lives best.</Q></P>
<P>True Religion, therefore, is a Man's Glory and Strong Hold in every situation of Life, whether Public or Private; and this brings me to my—</P>
<P>THIRD HEAD, Under which it was pro∣posed briefly to remind you, as a <HI>Fraternity,</HI> of the Principles by which you profess to regulate your Conduct towards Individuals in private Life; which still having that <HI>great</HI> Commandment of our HEAVENLY MASTER, <HI>Brotherly Love,</HI> as the chief Corner-Stone; every Thing raised upon it should be superlatively <HI>Grand</HI> and <HI>Fair.</HI></P>
<P>Hence, therefore, we must seek to ex∣pand our Souls to the whole human Species; ever striving to promote their Happiness to the utmost of our Power. Whatever is il∣liberal
<PB N="24" REF="016526_0024_0F9C8B1079BE5940"/>partial and contracted—a selfish and unfeeling Heart, coiled up within its own scanty Orb—we must reject from among us. Looking far beyond the little Distinc∣tions of Sect or Party (by which too many seek to know, and be known by, each other) we should labour to imitate the great Crea∣tor, in regarding those of every Nation, Re∣ligion, and Tongue, who <Q>fear Him, and work Righteousness.</Q></P>
<P>Such Conduct becomes those who profess to believe that when our MASTER CHRIST shall come again to reward his faithful Workmen and Servants; He will not ask whether we were of LUTHER or of CAL∣VIN? Whether we <HI>prayed</HI> to him in White, Black, or Grey; in Purple, or in Rags; in fine Linen, or in Sackcloth; in a woollen Frock, or peradventure in a <HI>Leather-Apron?</HI> Whatever is considered as most Convenient, most in Character, most for Edification, and infringes least on Spiritual Liberty, will be admitted as good in this Case.</P>
<P>But although we may believe that none of these Things will be asked in that Great Day; let us remember that it will be assur∣edly asked—Were we of CHRIST JESUS? <Q>Did we pray to him with the Spirit and with the Understanding?</Q> Had we the
<PB N="25" REF="016526_0025_0F9C8B1131E623B0"/>true Marks of his Gospel in our Lives? Were we "meek and lowly of Heart?" Did we nail our rebellious Affections to his Cross, and strive to subdue our Spirits to the Rule of his Spirit? But above all, it will be asked us—Were we cloathed with the <HI>Wedding-garment</HI> of LOVE? Did we recog∣nize our HEAVENLY MASTER in the Suf∣ferings of those whom he died to save? Did we, for his sake, open our Souls wide, to the Cries of HIS DISTRESSED POOR? <Q>When they were Hungry, did we give them Meat? When Thirsty, did we give them Drink? When Strangers, did we take them in? When Naked, did we clothe them? When Sick, did we visit them? When in Prison, did we come unto them,</Q> with Comfort and Relief?</P>
<P>This Day, my Brethren—nay, a few Moments hence—will furnish you with an Opportunity of laying up in your own Con∣sciences, and sending before you to Heaven, an <HI>Answer</HI> to those important Questions, against the awful Day of final Retribution.</P>
<P>Hark! do you not this instant hear— amidst the unavoidable Calamities of your Country, the deep Distresses of War, the extreme Rigour of the Season, the unusual Price and Scarcity of the chief <HI>Necessaries</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="016526_0026_0F9C8B11DFB0F9E0"/>of Life—BREAD, CLOATHING, and FUEL, — Hark! I say, Do you not, amidst these com∣plicated Distresses, this instant, hear the loud Cries of many <HI>Hungry, Naked, Cold, Sick,</HI> and almost <HI>ready to Perish?</HI>—</P>
<P>I know you <HI>hear</HI> them, and have come, with open Heart and open Hand, to <HI>relieve</HI> them. This was the chief Purpose of the present Solemnity; and I have your Instruc∣tions to press it Home, as the best Exercise of those Principles, in which you profess most eminently to shine. Nor will your <HI>Practice,</HI> I trust, ever fall short of your <HI>Profession;</HI> or give Room to apply the Pro∣phet's <HI>sarcastic</HI> Rebuke, either to your∣selves, or your Preacher— <Q>Lo! thou art unto them as a very lovely Song, of one that hath a pleasant Voice, and can play well upon an Instrument—for they <HI>hear</HI> thy Words, but they <HI>do</HI> them not.</Q> No, Brethren! you will never suffer this to be justly said of you; but, on the contrary, that you are always as ready to <HI>do</HI> as to <HI>hear.</HI></P>
<P>Many of you will remember, that near the <HI>fourth</HI> Part of a <HI>Century</HI>—a Period that hath been big with important Events and Revo∣lutions— hath passed away, since our last Meeting in this Place, on a similar Cccasi∣on.
<PB N="27" REF="016526_0027_0F9C8B12A26701C0"/>Let the POOR, then, have reason to consider our present Meeting, as a JUBILEE to them rather than to us.</P>
<P>And while I Address <HI>You</HI> on this Subject, I would, at the same time, beg leave to Ad∣dress the whole of this numerous and re∣spectable Auditory—for CHARITY is the concern of all; and we are peculiarly called to its highest Exercise at this particular Time.</P>
<P>But a few Days have past, since we were joining together in the SONG OF ANGELS; giving <HI>Thanks</HI> and <Q>Glory to God in the Highest</Q> for the BIRTH OF A SAVIOUR, and the <HI>Spiritual Deliverance</HI> accomplished by Him. In a few Days <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Thanksgiving Day appointed for Dec. 10th</NOTE> more, we are again, by special Appointment, to offer up <HI>Thanksgivings</HI> to God for whatever <HI>temporal</HI> Blessings and <HI>Deliverances</HI> we have received through his Goodness. On both Accounts, one of the best Sacrifices of <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> which we can offer, is—to raise the drooping Mourner; cheer the lonely Heart of Woe; and be the Instruments of Heaven for en∣creasing the Number of the <HI>Thankful.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Return of Gratitude which CHRIST peculiarly requires; namely, that,
<PB N="28" REF="016526_0028_0F9C8B13633F7BB8"/>from the Consideration of his unbounded <HI>Love</HI> to us, our Heart should overflow with <HI>Love</HI> to each other. Such <HI>Love</HI> is justly stiled— "the fulfilling of the whole Law," —the Sum and Substance of all Obedience. For true Religion being an Emanation from on high, cannot but shed <HI>Light</HI> upon the Understanding, and <HI>Love</HI> upon the Heart— even that <HI>Love,</HI> which, when genuine, will gradually consume every Thing that is gross and earthly within us; and mount up our Affections, at last, in a pure Flame, to the omnipotent Source of all Love.</P>
<P>Deeds of Love are the chief Employment of the Angels of God; and, into a Soul which overflows with <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Charity,</HI> Heaven may be said to have descended, while on Earth. The other Virtues and Graces bring us nearer to God, as it were, by slow approaches; but, by the Divine Virtue of <HI>Charity,</HI> we are borne into his direct Pre∣sence, as in a siery Chariot! This is the on∣ly Virtue which we can carry with us into the other World: Our <HI>Faith,</HI> after Death, shall be swallowed up in <HI>Sight,</HI> our <HI>Hope</HI> in <HI>Enjoyment;</HI> but our CHARITY, when we shake off this Mortality, shall then only be∣gin to have its full Scope, enlarging itself into unbounded Dimensions, as the main
<PB N="29" REF="016526_0029_0F9C8B1421F64A48"/>Ingredient of our Happiness, in the Regions of ETERNAL LOVE!</P>
<P>But I will detain you no longer, Brethren! —You all pant to have a Foretaste of the Joy of Angels, by calling forth into im∣mediate Exercise this heavenly Virtue of CHARITY; whereby you will give <NOTE N="*">At the Word <HI>"GLORY,"</HI> the <HI>BRETHREN</HI> rose together; and, in reverential Posture, on pro∣nouncing the Names of the <HI>TRI-UNE GOD,</HI> ac∣companied the same by a Correspondent Repetition of the Ancient Sign or Symbol of Divine Homage and Obeisance; concluding with the following <HI>RESPONSE</HI>—</NOTE> GLORY to the THRICE BLESSED THREE, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, one God over all!</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX.</HEAD>
<P>LUCIUS QUINTIUS CINCINNATUS was a Patrician of Rome. In the 293d Year of the City, his Son CAESO, a Youth of high Spirit, great Credit, and consum∣mate Bravery, exasperated the Tribunes of the People, by some severe Animadversions upon their Conduct; and was accused of TREASON. A Day was appointed for his Trial, and ten Securities (which was the first instance of <HI>Bail</HI>) taken for his Appearance; each being bound in the Sum of <HI>three thousand Asses,</HI> about <HI>Nine Pounds Thirteen Shill∣ings and Nine Pence,</HI> Sterling. Apprehensive of a Trial, where his Accusers were to be his Judges, he retired into voluntary Banishment among the Etrurians, before the Day fixed for his Appearance. His Father refused to suffer the Securities to Pay the Forfeiture, which fell short of <HI>One Hundred Pounds, Sterling;</HI> and sold all his Estate, to satisfy the public Justice, except about FOUR ACRES and a MEAN COTTAGE, on the farther Side of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> afterwards called the <HI>Quintian Meadows.</HI> To this little Spot he re∣tired, and supported himself in a humble, virtuous, and ob∣scure Independency, by the Labour of his own Hands, and of some Slaves; never crossing the River to visit the City, or take Part in Public Affairs.</P>
<P>About a Year afterwards, he was elected Consul, and called from his Retreat. He discharged his high Office with Dig∣nity; appeased the Tumults of the City; restored the Ad∣ministration of Justice; refused to set the bad Example of
<PB N="31" REF="016526_0031_0F9C8B159F159888"/>Suffering himself to be elected Consul a second Time, con∣trary to Law; and retired to his mean Cottage and small Farm, superior to all public Resentment on account of his private family Wrongs.</P>
<P>About two Years afterwards, the Aequi, having made War upon Rome, shut up the Consul MINUCIUS within his Camp near the City; and brought him to the Extremi∣ty, either of starving by Famine, or surrendering at Dis∣cretion. In this sad Emergency, CINCINNATUS was de∣clared DICTATOR, and a deputation of the Senate sent to bring him from his Retreat. The venerable Patriot was <HI>at his Plough,</HI> <Q>covered only from his Reins to his Knees, with a Cap on his Head.</Q> When he saw the Deputies, with their Croud of Attendants approaching, he stopped his Oxen; and asking, <HI>if all was well,</HI> ordered his wife <HI>Racilia</HI> in haste to bring his Gown, that he might be co∣vered, in Respect to his Visitants. Being <HI>cloathed,</HI> and the Dust and Sweat wiped from his Face, (we may presume by the Hands of his faithful <HI>Racilia</HI>) he was saluted <HI>Dictator</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Livy's words are, (iii. 26.) Satin' salva essent omnia? Togam propere e Tugurio proferre, Uxorem Raciliam jubet.—Abste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>so Pul∣vere ac Sudore, velatus processit; Dictatorem eum Legati gratulantes consalutant—in Urbem vocant: qui terror sit in exercitu, exponunt</NOTE>; cloathed with the <HI>Purple;</HI> and, preceded by the Lictors, with their Axes, desired to step into a Boat and follow them to Rome. At the awful Voice of his Country, he paid an instant and silent Obedience; dropped a few do∣mestic Tears—uttering at last only these Words— <Q><HI>My Field, then, will not be sown this Year</HI>—RACILIA! <HI>take Care of our houshold Affairs!</HI></Q></P>
<P>He conquered the Aequi; rescued the Consul; took <HI>Corbio,</HI> the Enemy's principal City; made them pass under the Yoke; returned to Rome with their General in Chains; was honoured with a splendid Triumph; refused to increase
<PB N="32" REF="016526_0032_0F9C8B1661529038"/>his little wrecked Fortune, by accepting any share of the Spoils, or conquered Lands; abdicated the <HI>Dictatorship</HI> the <HI>sixteenth Day;</HI> and returned again to his little Farm. —"Happy Times! admirable Simplicity!" says Rollin <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rollin and some other Moderns, following Dionysius, mention all those Circumstances of his being found at the Plough, half Naked, covered with Dust, &amp;c. when he was sent for to be Consul, about two Years before. But, on Account of the Tumults in the City, the Elec∣tion of Consuls did not take place that Year, till the Month of De∣cember; a Season neither suitable for the Plough, nor correspond∣ing with Dust, Sweat, and a half-naked Body. I have, therefore, followed Livy, as better informed than the Greck Historian; though, without doubt, Cincinnatus on both Occasions was found busy in his rural Labour.</NOTE></P>
<P>This is the CINCINNATUS whose Character is briefly touched in the foregoing Sermon; but, as if Magnanimity and Moderation were the hereditary Qualities of the Name and Family, there was another CINCINNATUS (TITUS QUINTIUS) in the 375th year of Rome (Liv. VI. 28, 29) who followed the Example of the former. At that Period, when the private Dissentions of the Citizens raged with such violence, as superseded all attention to the public Safety; the Praenestines, seizing the favourable opportunity, invad∣ed the Roman Territory; and, laying all waste before them, advanced to the Colline Gate, threatning the immediate Destruction of the City. In this dreadful Crisis, the Second CINCINNATUS, who had been one of the Military Tribunes, was called forth to the high Office of Dictator Such was the Veneration of his Character among his Fel∣low-Citizens, and the Dread of it among their Enemies; that the Voice of Dissention immediately ceased among the former, and the latter fled with Precipitation from the Walls. He pursued and reduced them to Peace, having first taken all their Cities (<HI>nine</HI> in Number) including <HI>Preneste</HI> itself; carrying back from thence in Triumph the <HI>Statue</HI> of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> which, as a monument of his Virtues, was erected
<PB N="33" REF="016526_0033_0F9C8B1720A577B8"/>in the Capitol, with the following Inscription upon its Pedestal, viz.—</P>
<P><Q>JUPITER ATQUE DIVI OMNES HOC DEDERUNT, UT T. QUINTIUS DICTATOR OPPIDA NOVEM CAPERET.</Q></P>
<P>But it was neither this Monument of his Country's Gra∣titude, nor the Exploits for which it was Dedicated, that could have secured to him his principal Eminence of Re∣nown. The Monument hath yielded to the waste of years or barbaric Rage; and his Fame, as well as that of the Elder Cincinnatus, would now, at most, have only been blended with theirs, who, for the sake of their Country, have mag∣nanimously subdued <HI>others;</HI> if each of them had not exhi∣bited a more illustrious Proof of Magnanimity by subduing <HI>Himself.</HI> For, although they might severally have held the Dictatorship <HI>six Months,</HI> and thereby advanced their own Fortune, their Friends and Dependents; yet having attained the glorious End for which they were invested with it, the former, as already mentioned, abdicated the same the <HI>sixteenth,</HI> and the latter the <HI>twentieth Day;</HI> both retiring self-satisfied, amidst the Applauses of their Country, to enjoy the calm Repose of private Life.</P>
<P>The eloquent and judicious <HI>Rollin,</HI> speaking of the elder CINCINNATUS, makes the following beautiful Reflections: <Q>Methinks I see Poverty enter Rome in Triumph with him. It appears indeed cloathed with Purple, and with a pompous Equipage; but does not derive its Lustre from them. It rather adorns that Pomp, and exalts the Splen∣dor of the Purple. The Dictator will soon return to his Field and his Labor; but he will be neither less great nor less venerable, in his humble poor Cottage, than he is now upon his Car of Victory. What force, what Power has Virtue! It lends its Lustre to all that surrounds it, and imparts to every Thing an Irradiation of Glory and Magnificence—Amidst the highest Praises and Blessings,
<PB N="34" REF="016526_0034_0F9C8B17E2FC0E00"/>the object of Universal Love and Admiration, Quintius divested himself of the <HI>Purple,</HI> and made Haste to re∣turn to his OXEN and his PLOUGH—Is there any Thing wanting to the Glory of Quintius? Can the greatest Riches <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The following fine Reslexion of Livy, is the Basis of Rollin's Reflexious on this Subject.—Operae pretium est audire, qui omnia prae Divitiis humana spernunt, neque honori magno locum, neque Virtuti putant esse, nisi ubi effuse aff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ant opes. <HI>Spes unica Impe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Populi Romani</HI> 1.

Do they leave behind them in the minds of those that behold them, the same Sentiments, as the simple Relation of what regards Cincinnatus gives the Reader? Can one, however prejudiced in Favor of Vanity and Glare, deny him Es∣teem and Admiration? There is then something truly great and noble in the Character of this <HI>Roman. What an Happiness is it for a State, a Province, a City, when they who have the Administration of Government appreach, tho' at a Distance, the Sentiments which we admire in Quantius? —an inflexible Constancy for supporting good Order and Di∣scipline, tempered with a Mildness and Candor proper for gaining the affection of the People—a Conduct uniform, and always guided by Reason, never by Humor or Caprice—a Love of the public Good, superior to all Passions and Preju∣dices —an universal Disinterestedness, which never departs from itself, &amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Struck with an enthusiastic Veneration for this Part of Cincinnatus's Character (and that of other Romans, such as Fabricius, who shewed themselves superior to all the Temp∣tations of Wealth and Power) our Poet THOMSON nobly contrasts the following beautiful Lines, to the growing Luxury and Corruption of his Day—</P>
<Q><PB N="35" REF="016526_0035_0F9C8B18A2933A10"/>
<L>In ancient Times, the sacred <HI>Plough</HI> employ'd</L>
<L>The Kings and awful Fathers of Mankind;</L>
<L>And some, with whom compar'd, your Insect Tribes</L>
<L>Are but the Beings of a Summer's Day,</L>
<L>Have held the Scale of Empire, rul'd the Storm</L>
<L>Of mighty War; then, with unwearied hand,</L>
<L>Disdaining little Delicacies, seiz'd</L>
<L>The <HI>Plough,</HI> and greatly <HI>Independent</HI> liv'd.</L>
<BIBL>SPRING; l. 59, &amp;c.</BIBL></Q>
<P>FABRICIUS, mentioned above, could not be corrupted by an offer of one fourth of the Kingdom of <HI>Pyrrhus,</HI> nor by all the Gold of the <HI>Samnites;</HI> nobly answering— <HI>"Romam aurum non habere, sed habentibus aurum Imperare."</HI> Hence Virgil stiles him—<HI>Fabricium parvs Potentem.</HI> The Passage in Pitt's Translation is—</P>
<Q><L>Who can the bold Fabricius worth repeat,</L>
<L>In Pride of Poverty divinely great;</L>
<L>Call'd by his bleeding Country's Voice to come</L>
<L>From the rude <HI>Plough,</HI> and rule imperial Rome!</L></Q>
<P>The length of these Remarks and Quotations, it is hop∣ed, will be excused. Models of ancient Virtue are not im∣proper for us; and whoever would have some of the most shining briefly placed before them, may find them brought together, and beautifully touched, in Thomson's Autumn. 439. to 529; compared with Virgil's Aen.
