<HEAD><HI>A</HI> PREFACFE <HI>OF Dr.</HI> Increase Mather.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN the <HI>Eight Ministers</HI> who at this time carry on the an∣cient and famous <HI>Thursday-Lecture</HI> of <HI>BOSTON,</HI> agreed upon Preaching <HI>Eight Ser∣mons</HI> on the Nature, and Methods, and Motives, of EARLY PIETY, I did with Satisfaction Look on this their Agreement as a Motion from GOD; And I could <HI>have no Greater Joy,</HI> than to see <HI>my Children thus Walking in the Truth,</HI> and so zealous to Invite and Perswade the Children of their People, to <HI>Chuse the Way of Truth,</HI> and <HI>Walk with the GOD of their Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>THEY have sollicited a Line or two, from my
<PB N="ii" REF="002256_0001_0FDAC972D7CC3578"/>Aged and now Shaking, Hand, to Testify my Sa∣tisfaction in what they have done, and I Cheerful∣ly give it.</P>
<P>PIETY, or, the Return of a Soul to GOD in His CHRIST, and a <HI>Godly,</HI> and <HI>Sober,</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> Life led upon it, is the <HI>whole Duty,</HI> and Interest, and Wisdom of Man; And the more <HI>Early</HI> the <HI>Piety,</HI> the Greater the Wisdom and Comfort and Glory of them that come into it. <HI>These are Things that cannot be Spoken a∣gainst!</HI></P>
<P>I therefore do Recommend this Book, of <HI>Early Piety,</HI> not only unto the <HI>Young People</HI> in the Country, but also unto their <HI>Parents;</HI> Advising them to Recommend it unto their Families, and make it accompany the <HI>Charges</HI> which they Lay upon their Children, to <HI>know and Serve the GOD of their Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>AS for me, I am now in the <HI>Eighty Third</HI> Year of my Age. And having had in my Mino∣rity, an Opportunity to Converse with the most Renowned Servants of GOD, who were the <HI>First Planters</HI> of this Country, and of the Churches in it; and having been for <HI>Sixty Five</HI> Years a Preacher of the Gospel, after my poor manner, in these Churches; Except some Years, when I have been favoured of GOD with Opportunities to Serve Him in <HI>Europe,</HI> first, when I was a very Young Man, in <HI>Dublin,</HI> in <HI>Glocester,</HI> and in <HI>Guer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sey,</HI> before the Year <HI>1662.</HI> and after words, when I was was more than Thir∣ty Years ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> absent from my Charge, for Four Year<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in an A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ency for the Country: I cannot
<PB N="iii" REF="002256_0001_0FDAC972D7CC3578"/>but be in the Disposition of those <HI>Ancient Men,</HI> who had <HI>Seen the Foundation of the First House,</HI> and <HI>Wept with a Loud Voice,</HI> to see what a <HI>Change</HI> the Work of the <HI>Temple</HI> had upon it. I wish it were no other than the Weakness of <HI>Ho∣race</HI>'s old Man, the <HI>Laudator Temporis acti,</HI> when I complain that there is a Grievous <HI>Decay of Piety</HI> in the Land; and a <HI>Leaving of the First Love:</HI> And that the <HI>Beauties of Holiness</HI> are not to be seen in our Churches, as once they were: A <HI>Fruitful Christian,</HI> grown too Rare a Spectacle: Yea, too many are <HI>Given to Change,</HI> and Leave that <HI>Order of the Gospel,</HI> to Sett up and uphold which, was the very Design of these Colonies: And the very Interest of <HI>NEW-ENG∣LAND</HI> seems to be <HI>Changed</HI> from a <HI>Religious</HI> to a <HI>Worldly</HI> Interest. On which Accounts, it is to be feared, that awful <HI>changes</HI> are further coming on the Country; and that the Holy SON of GOD, offended at the Apostasy, may order for it, a deep share in the <HI>Cup of Trembling,</HI> which He is now upon giving to the Sinful Nations. I must <HI>Weep,</HI> and I now do it <HI>with a Loud Voice,</HI> for what I see. <HI>Oh! That my Head were Waters, &amp; my Eyes a Fountain of Tears!</HI></P>
<P>NOTHING will contribute so much, to avert the Evil <HI>Tokens,</HI> at which <HI>they who dwell in the Wilderness</HI> may be <HI>afraid;</HI> as a Revival of <HI>PIETY,</HI> Even of <HI>EARLY PIETY,</HI> in the Ri∣sing Generation.</P>
<P>MY own poor Essays for that purpose, have been Published, and Repeated, and some of them <HI>Reprinted</HI> many Years ago. And now, I Ear∣nestly
<PB N="iv" REF="002256_0002_0FDADD33CC718430"/>pray to the GOD of all Grace, that He would succeed these Holy Labours of <HI>My Sons,</HI> to serve the same Designs of <HI>Early Piety.</HI></P>
<P>I will call them, <HI>My Sons;</HI> Because the <HI>First</HI> of them, (whom also, being <HI>Fifty Eight</HI> Years Old, the r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st esteem as a <HI>Father</HI> to them,) is by <HI>Na∣ture</HI> so; and has for One and Forty Years <HI>as a Son with a Father Served with me in the Gospel.</HI> The Rest of them are such as I have Reason to <HI>Love</HI> as my <HI>Children.</HI> They are all of them Faithful Servants of GOD; and precious <HI>Gifts</HI> of our Ascended SAVIOUR unto His Churches. They have all of them heretofore given unto the Public in the Way of the <HI>Press</HI> Desireable Fruits and Proofs of their Abilities; whereof some have been upon the Subject of <HI>Early Piety.</HI> And what <HI>Acceptable Words</HI> must these <HI>Preachers</HI> bring, when they have been such Laudable <HI>Examples</HI> themselves in their own <HI>Practice</HI> of that <HI>EARLY PIETY,</HI> which they thus <HI>Preach</HI> unto others!</P>
<P>I am <HI>going the Way of all the Earth,</HI> and have been many Years Longing for that <HI>Blessed Hour,</HI> when I shall (I have a <HI>Good Hope thro' Grace</HI>) be <HI>received into the Everlasting Habi∣tations,</HI> and into that World, which has no Sin and no Temptation to Sin in it, and where a CHRIST is to be seen in His Wondrous Glories. <HI>But, Thou, O Lord, How Long!</HI></P>
<P>AS <HI>Polycarp</HI> going to dy, gave his Testimony, <HI>That he had Served CHRIST more than Four∣score Years, and had always found a Good Master of Him!</HI> I would now also Dy bearing my Testimony for Him, who in my Early Youth
<PB N="v" REF="002256_0002_0FDADD33CC718430" MS="y"/>mercifully Siezed me f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Himself, <HI>That in all my Pilgrimage I have also found a Good Master of that Glorious LORD.</HI> But what a <HI>Good Master</HI> I shall find Him, <HI>I know not Now, I shall know Hereafter.</HI> I shall not <HI>know,</HI> till He sent for me! — <HI>Which, O my GOD and SAVIOUR, I am daily waiting for; — Why is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hy Chariot so long in coming?

<P>Give unto <HI>Solomon</HI> my Son a PERFECT HEART.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">O</SEG> BLESSED and Hopeful CHILDREN, and what Comforts to their <HI>Pa∣rents,</HI> that are made Par∣takers of such a <HI>Blessing!</HI> O Blessed and Joyful PA∣RENTS, that may see such a <HI>Blessing</HI> Obtained for their <HI>Children!</HI> EARLY PIETY is the Glo∣rious Blessedness. <HI>A PIOUS MIND</HI> is that <HI>Perfect Heart,</HI> which we have in Prosecution. There is an Unspeakable Passion in the Souls
<PB N="2" REF="002256_0004_0FDADD3799B65238"/>of <HI>Parents,</HI> To <HI>see their Children Happy. Nature</HI> knows not a <HI>Passion</HI> more Vehement more En∣gaging. I am going to show you, O CHIL∣DREN, What will make you <HI>Happy:</HI> I am go∣ing to show you, O PARENTS, How you may come to see them <HI>Happy.</HI> O <HI>set your Hearts unto these Things;</HI> Your <HI>Life</HI> is in them. Give a Great Attention. <HI>But, O Gra∣cious GOD, make Thou a Good Impression upon the Hearers of them!</HI></P>
<P>I Remember that on a Coin of the Empe∣rour <HI>Constans,</HI> which we have in our Hands, there is the Emperour drawing a <HI>Youth</HI> after him, and those Words about him, <HI>Faelix Tempo∣rum Reparatio:</HI> Intimating, That for the Re∣forming of the Times, <HI>Youth</HI> is Principally to be dealt withal. Sensible of This, the mana∣gers of your <HI>Lectures,</HI> propose now a <HI>Sett of Sermons</HI> on EARLY PIETY; Hoping in, and Waiting on Heaven, to give an Efficacy to them.</P>
<P>WE find the Illustrious <HI>David</HI> a little before he died, very Sollicitous about the Welfare of the <HI>Son,</HI> that was to Survive him, and Succeed him; To have the Son, whom his own Eyes, and the Eyes of the People were much upon, <HI>Do worthily</HI> after he should be Dead.</P>
<P>BEHOLD, First, The <HI>Method</HI> which is ta∣ken by a <HI>Father full of Goodness,</HI> that so he might have an <HI>Happy Son,</HI> and a <HI>Son</HI> that
<PB N="3" REF="002256_0004_0FDADD3799B65238"/>should be like him. He <HI>Prays</HI> for the <HI>Son:</HI> He carries him to GOD; he commits him to GOD; he intreats GOD Mercifully to take Notice of him. No <HI>Method</HI> like to This.</P>
<P>BUT then, Behold, Secondly, The <HI>Blessing</HI> to be sought in this <HI>Method;</HI> the <HI>Blessing</HI> which alone makes an <HI>Happy Son.</HI> A <HI>Perfect Heart</HI> is that <HI>Blessing.</HI> A <HI>Perfect Heart</HI> is here desired for a <HI>Solomon:</HI> A Thing enough to make an Happy <HI>Solomon!</HI> I observe by the way an Hebrew Elegancy in the Original. The Name of <HI>Solomon</HI> is derived from that Word that Signifies, <HI>To be Perfect,</HI> as well as to be <HI>Peaceable;</HI> and the very Word that is used here. It is, q. d. <Q>Lord, make my <HI>Solo∣mon</HI> a Real <HI>Solomon,</HI> give to my <HI>Solomon</HI> the Heart of a <HI>Solomon,</HI> let the <HI>Heart</HI> as well as the <HI>Name</HI> of my <HI>Son,</HI> have that <HI>Perfection,</HI> which will have <HI>Peace</HI> Entail'd upon it.</Q></P>
<P>I am again to tell you, That a <HI>Pious Mind,</HI> is the Thing to be Understood by a <HI>Perfect Heart.</HI> And this is the DOCTRINE which now very strongly demands a devout Recep∣tion with you.</P>
<P><HI>THE PIOUS MIND, of a PERFECT HEART will make Blessed CHILDREN: And PA∣RENTS ought fervently to pour out their Prayer unto the GOD of all Grace, to pour down such a Blessing upon their Children.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="002256_0005_0FDADD39028C11B0"/>
I. IT will be proper, in the First place, to declare, what that <HI>Blessing</HI> is, which being found in our <HI>Children,</HI> they will be <HI>known to be an Offspring which the Lord has Blessed. Children,</HI> It is a <HI>Perfect Heart</HI> that must be found in you, if you would not incur the Doom of <HI>cursed Children.</HI> But I am again, and again, to tell you, that a <HI>Pious Mind</HI> is that <HI>Perfect Heart.</HI> A Principle of PIETY in∣fused into the <HI>Heart,</HI> is that which will make it a <HI>Perfect Heart.</HI> We do not Expect from you an <HI>absolute perfection,</HI> which the <HI>heart</HI> of no Man in this World may pretend unto; or an <HI>Heart perfectly,</HI> compleatly, exactly, and in all points Conformed unto the Law of GOD, which no Man in this World has attain'd un∣to. Since the <HI>Fal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of Man, there never was but ONE MAN, whose <HI>Heart</HI> in all things complied with the Will of GOD; And HE was more than a Meer MAN. <HI>It was thy heart, O our IMMANUEL.</HI> It was HE, who with a <HI>Perfect Heart,</HI> wrought out, and brought in, the <HI>Righteousness,</HI> which alone you are to plead before GOD, O our <HI>Children,</HI> that you may be <HI>Justified. Who can say, I have made my heart clean?</HI> But then, there is a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Evangelical perfection,</HI> which will be Expect∣ed and Required of you. Otherwise, O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> who was no Old Man could not have made su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> an Appeal to the Glorious GOD, as that, Is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> XXXVIII. 3. <HI>O Lord, I have walked before the with a perfect heart.</HI> The <HI>exceeding Broad La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of our GOD, may say, <HI>Tho'</HI> Noah <HI>and</HI> Jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="5" REF="002256_0005_0FDADD39028C11B0"/><HI>stood before me, I would condemn them; they should not so much as deliver their own souls, by the perfection of their own righteousness.</HI> And yet both <HI>Noah</HI> and <HI>Job,</HI> had that Character, <HI>He was a perfect Man:</HI> Which implies a <HI>per∣fect heart</HI> in those <HI>holy ones.</HI> Truly, such an <HI>Heart</HI> is produced, where a Principle of PIE∣TY is in its operation.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE, First, O Children, If you would be owned for Children of a <HI>perfect heart,</HI> you must make sure, of an <HI>Hearty,</HI> Real, Thorough <HI>Conversion</HI> unto GOD. You read of such an Excellent Thing as that; Ezek. XXXVI. 26. <HI>A new heart will I give you.</HI> This <HI>New Heart</HI> will be a <HI>Perfect</HI> One. A <HI>Changed Heart,</HI> a <HI>Cleansed Heart,</HI> an <HI>Heart</HI> with a <HI>New Biass</HI> upon it; an <HI>Heart</HI> no longer set upon the <HI>Vanities</HI> of the World; an <HI>Heart</HI> wherein GOD resumes His <HI>Throne,</HI> and <HI>Idols</HI> are dethroned, and GOD has the Regards paid unto Him, which have heretofore been Sin∣fully paid unto <HI>Creatures;</HI> This is the <HI>Per∣fect Heart.</HI> An <HI>heart</HI> filled with the <HI>Love</HI> of GOD, and set above all Things, to chuse and to do the Things that <HI>please</HI> Him; an <HI>Heart</HI> filled with the <HI>Love</HI> of CHRIST, and closing with Him in all His <HI>Offices,</HI> and Feeding and Living on the <HI>Fulness</HI> of which there is <HI>All</HI> in Him; an <HI>Heart</HI> filled with the <HI>Love</HI> which is due to <HI>Mankind,</HI> and which will make one <HI>do as he would be done <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> This is the <HI>Pious Mind,</HI> which, <HI>O Children,</HI> You must come into,
<PB N="6" REF="002256_0006_0FDADD410AFAF190"/>if you would not <HI>perish Wonderfully.</HI> And there will be a <HI>Perfect Heart,</HI> in this <HI>Pious Mind.</HI> There will be this to Legitimate the Expression; A True <HI>Conversion</HI> to PIETY, is what will reach to every <HI>Faculty</HI> of the <HI>Heart.</HI> The <HI>New Creature,</HI> in the Converts of <HI>Zion,</HI> is <HI>Perfect,</HI> in that it has <HI>every part;</HI> tho' the <HI>Renovation</HI> be but <HI>in part.</HI> A Young Person brought home to GOD, has his <HI>Understanding</HI> Enlightened; his <HI>Phantasy</HI> Regulated; his <HI>Memory</HI> Purified; his <HI>Will</HI> Rectified; his <HI>Af∣fections</HI> brought into Order; he gives up his <HI>whole heart</HI> unto GOD; he reserves no <HI>Powers</HI> of his <HI>Mind,</HI> but concerning all of them, he says, <HI>Oh! Let my SAVIOUR take possession of it.</HI></P>
<P>SECONDLY; As we would bring out <HI>Children</HI> to a <HI>Profession</HI> of PIETY, so we would Exhort them to <HI>Sincerity</HI> in their <HI>Profession, Children,</HI> Get a <HI>Sincere Heart,</HI> and you will have a <HI>Perfect Heart. Sincerity</HI> has a sort of <HI>Perfection</HI> in it. You must have your <HI>Heart</HI> engaged in what you do about the <HI>Ser∣vice</HI> of God; and when He calls, Prov. XXIII. 28. <HI>My son, give me thy heart;</HI> your <HI>heart</HI> must reply, <HI>My God, I am intirely thine!</HI> The <HI>Heart</HI> as well as the <HI>Name,</HI> is to be given unto the Lord; the <HI>Heart</HI> is to be <HI>washed from Wicked∣ness,</HI> and every thing that is offensive unto GOD, must be banished from it. This is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>perfect heart.</HI> And a Young Person of such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Pious Mind,</HI> will <HI>Realize</HI> the <HI>Eye</HI> of GOD up∣on
<PB N="7" REF="002256_0006_0FDADD410AFAF190"/>him, and behave himself as having his ve∣ry <HI>Heart Naked and Open</HI> before Him. <HI>Walk before me and be perfect,</HI> said our God unto the Patriarch. Children, you must <HI>Walk as be∣fore GOD,</HI> wherever you come. And here∣withal, both do that which is <HI>Right;</HI> and have a <HI>Right Aim</HI> in your doing of it. Sin∣cerely <HI>Aim</HI> at Offering up to GOD, an <HI>Accep∣table Sacrifice;</HI> not aiming at the <HI>Praise of Man</HI> in what you do; not meerly seeking to avoid the <HI>Censures,</HI> of your Superiours, or your Observers, in what you do.</P>
<P>THIRDLY. We cannot be satisfied, Except our <HI>Children</HI> Endeavour an <HI>universal Obedience</HI> unto GOD. What is a <HI>perfect heart?</HI> A <HI>Da∣vid,</HI> even <HI>one of a thousand,</HI> shall be our <HI>inter∣preter.</HI> Says he, <HI>'Tis to keep the Command∣ments, even to do all these Things. Children,</HI> You will <HI>be</HI> before GOD, what you <HI>Desire,</HI> and <HI>Study,</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> to be. A <HI>Perfect Heart,</HI> and a <HI>Perfection</HI> of <HI>Obedience</HI> to God, is to be mightily and constantly Endeavoured with you. You have those two together, 1 Chron. XXVIII. 9. <HI>My son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and a willing mind.</HI> Your <HI>heart</HI> will be <HI>perfect</HI> if your <HI>Mind</HI> be <HI>Willing,</HI> to be, and to do, all that you find GOD enjoyning upon you. A Young Person willing to be <HI>perfect and intire, lacking of nothing</HI> in his <HI>Obedience</HI> to GOD; willing and wishing to be made <HI>perfect in e∣very good Work, doing the Will of God;</HI> willing
<PB N="8" REF="002256_0007_0FDADD420BD3C560"/>and wishing <HI>to deny all ungodliness and lead a Godly, and a Sober, and a Righteous Life;</HI> And one, who if he might have his <HI>Will</HI> would ne∣ver Sin against the GOD <HI>that is above;</HI> One who makes it his <HI>Exercise to keep a conscience v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id of offence towards God and man:</HI> This is one of a <HI>Perfect Heart.</HI> Oh! may you all, with such a <HI>Pious Mind,</HI> have <HI>Respect unto all the Commandments of God!</HI></P>
<P>Finally, O, our Children, Being thus disposed for PIETY, and Resolved for the ways of GOD, we must have you <HI>fixed</HI> in your Holy <HI>Resolutions,</HI> with an Humble Dependence on your SAVIOUR, for the Aids of His Grace. You must come to that, Psal. LVI. 7. <HI>My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed:</HI> It is an <HI>heart fixed</HI> for GOD. This <HI>Fixed Heart,</HI> will be a <HI>Perfect Heart.</HI> You must not only <HI>Begin</HI> well, but <HI>Hold</HI> on, and <HI>Hold out,</HI> unto the <HI>End.</HI> A <HI>Pious Mind</HI> will be sure to do so; will with a <HI>Patient continu∣ance in Well-doing, lay hold on Eternal Life.</HI> The Apostasy of <HI>Solomon</HI> was very disagreea∣ble to the <HI>Perfect Heart</HI> which the <HI>Prayer</HI> of his <HI>Father</HI> beg'd on his behalf. But then in his Recovery out of his Apostacy, we may hope that the <HI>Prayer</HI> was answered.</P>
<P>THIS, This is the <HI>Blessing,</HI> which will in∣vest our <HI>Children</HI> with all <HI>Blessings;</HI> all the <HI>Blessings of Goodness</HI> are Comprehended in it This the <HI>Blessing,</HI> which, Oh! <HI>what shall we do,</HI> that our <HI>Children</HI> may be enriched with it</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="9" REF="002256_0007_0FDADD420BD3C560"/>
II. I said, <HI>What shall we do?</HI> And this is what I am going to tell you. <HI>And now, O ye Parents, this Commandment is for you!</HI> It is required of you, To <HI>pour out</HI> your Fervent PRAYER unto the GOD of all Grace, that He would <HI>pour down</HI> the <HI>Blessing</HI> of a <HI>Perfect Heart,</HI> and a <HI>Pious Mind</HI> upon your <HI>Children.</HI> As for the Genuine Children of <HI>Abraham, I know them,</HI> says the Lord; Whatever <HI>Offspring</HI> may be given to them, they will cry to GOD, <HI>Oh! That my Offspring may live in thy sight!</HI> Yea, they will keep crying to Him, till their <HI>Weeping Faith</HI> has received this Answer from Him; <HI>As for that Offspring, I have heard thee!

<P><HI>PARENTS,</HI> What is your <HI>main concern</HI> for your <HI>Children?</HI> PIETY in you, will make it your <HI>main concern</HI> that they may have a <HI>Pious Mind</HI> Enlightening and Inclining of them. If your <HI>main concern</HI> be, to get the <HI>Riches</HI> of <HI>this World</HI> for your <HI>Children,</HI> and leave a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>el∣ly-full</HI> of <HI>this World</HI> unto them, it looks very suspiciously, as if you were yourselves the People of <HI>this World,</HI> whose <HI>Portion</HI> is only in <HI>this Life.</HI> Most certainly, you are <HI>Earthly Minded</HI> ones, if your <HI>main concern</HI> for your <HI>Children</HI> be, that they may have the fine Things of the <HI>Earth</HI> heaped upon them, and if in your Thoughts for them you only <HI>Mind Earthly Things.</HI> Your own <HI>heart is not Right in the Sight of GOD,</HI> if you are not thorough∣ly perswaded of this, That for your <HI>Children</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002256_0008_0FDADD4386ABDED8"/>to be enriched with a <HI>Perfect Heart</HI> will be of more Account than for them to be suppli∣ed with Silver and with Gold, or with any perishable Riches. You are directed, Mat. VI. 33. <HI>Seek first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness.</HI> The direction is, That you do so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your <HI>Children,</HI> as well as for <HI>yourselves.</HI> Oh! <HI>Seek first</HI> that with the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of a <HI>Pious Mind</HI> they may be brought into the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> We read indeed, <HI>That Wis∣dom is good with an Inheritance,</HI> But what <HI>Good</HI> will any <HI>Temporal Inheritance</HI> do them, if your <HI>Children</HI> be not made <HI>Wise unto Salva∣tion? Parents,</HI> if you have a <HI>Perfect Heart</HI> yourselves, nothing but such an <HI>Heart</HI> in your <HI>Children</HI> can make you easy about them. You are yourselves without the <HI>Fear of GOD,</HI> if you can easily bear to see your <HI>Children</HI> with∣out it. We read, Prov. XVII. 25. <HI>A foolish son is a grief to his father, and a bitterness to her that bare him.</HI> To see a Son taking such Cour∣ses, as a <HI>Pious Mind</HI> cannot but abhor to take such, that if he Dye Impenitent, he must be mourned over as another <HI>Absalom:</HI> To see a <HI>Daughter</HI> so Lewd, so Base, as a <HI>Pious Mind</HI> would abhor to be, one of whom you must complain, <HI>Alas, my Daughter, thou hast brought me Low, and thou art one of them who Trouble me.</HI> What a <HI>Grievous Bitterness</HI> must such a Thing be to <HI>Parents,</HI> that are not <HI>utterly Forsaken of GOD. Parents,</HI> This is the Thing to be again and again Urged upon you. Write after the Copy of the <HI>Beloved</HI> Man, who had <HI>an Heart after
<PB N="11" REF="002256_0008_0FDADD4386ABDED8"/>the Heart of GOD.</HI> Lift up a <HI>Prayer,</HI> yea, a Cry that shall reach and pierce the Heavens, unto the Glorious Lord; <HI>Lord, Give Thou a Perfect Heart unto mine Offspring.</HI> The <HI>Pa∣rents</HI> of Old came unto our SAVIOUR for their <HI>Children,</HI> that had <HI>Maladies</HI> on them, or were seized by <HI>Evil Spirits;</HI> And He had Compassion on them. Oh! Implore this Com∣passion of your SAVIOUR for your <HI>Children.</HI> A <HI>Pious Mind,</HI> would relieve all their <HI>Mala∣dies,</HI> would rescue them from all <HI>Evil Spirits</HI> would make Lovely and Happy <HI>Children</HI> of them.</P>
<P>THE Matter is to be yet more distinctly Prosecuted, with several <HI>Admonitions of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>FIRST. I pray, What is that <HI>Heart</HI> which these poor <HI>Children</HI> of yours are born withal? Truly, such an one as you know, that <HI>you</HI> be∣fore them were born withal. A <HI>Sinful Heart,</HI> a <HI>Corrupt Heart,</HI> a <HI>Vicious Heart,</HI> an <HI>Heart</HI> that is a very <HI>Hell of Wickedness.</HI> What are your <HI>Children</HI> by <HI>Nature!</HI> Such a <HI>Nature</HI> as the <HI>Poison of the Old serpent</HI> entring into our <HI>First Parents,</HI> has brought upon them? It is a sad Relation, which the O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cles of GOD have given of it; Eph. II. 3. <HI>By nature the Children of wrath.</HI> What is the <HI>Heart</HI> which your <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> bring into the World with them? What? But an <HI>Heart that is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked?</HI> What, But <HI>an evil Heart of Unbelief which always departs
<PB N="12" REF="002256_0009_0FDADD48B450FD78"/>from the Living GOD?</HI> It is the same <HI>Heart,</HI> that the People before the Flood were infect∣ed withal; Gen. VI. 5. <HI>Every Imagination of the thoughts of the heart only evil continually.</HI> O <HI>Wretched Heart!</HI> Who and what shall <HI>deli∣ver</HI> your <HI>Children</HI> from such an <HI>Heart?</HI> Or, How can you bear to see them ly in these deadly Circumstances; thus <HI>Dead in Trespasses and Sins?</HI> A <HI>Perfect Heart</HI> will be the only deliverance of your <HI>Children</HI> from this <HI>Wretch∣ed Heart.</HI> Nothing but a <HI>Pious Mind,</HI> and a Sanctifying Work of God upon the <HI>Heart,</HI> can bring the <HI>Heart</HI> of your <HI>Children</HI> out of the woful Depravation, that Sin has brought upon them. And <HI>O Parents,</HI> you are concerned the more to seek this Deliverance for them, inasmuch as it is thro' <HI>your Mediation,</HI> that this Distempered <HI>Heart</HI> is convey'd unto them. 'Tis an <HI>Hereditary Distemper;</HI> thro' you Loins there is made the Conveyance of it. The best of <HI>Parents</HI> have such an Heart-break∣ing Thought as this to Humble them. Eve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Sons of <HI>Jesse the Righteous,</HI> may say, <HI>I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother con∣ceive me.</HI> Oh! What Reason have you to do all that can be done, that the <HI>Heart</HI> of your <HI>Children</HI> may be cured of the <HI>Leprosy,</HI> and the <HI>Grievous Diseases,</HI> which <HI>you</HI> have given them? It was a <HI>Fair Law</HI> concerning the Man that had <HI>Wounded</HI> another; Exod. XXI. 19. <HI>He shall cause him to be thoroughly healed.</HI> What! won't you do what you can, that your <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> may be <HI>Thoroughly healed</HI> of the <HI>Wounds,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="002256_0009_0FDADD48B450FD78"/>given them, whereto you yourselves are Ac∣cessary? O Worthy to be called <HI>Parricides</HI> rather than <HI>Parents! Entrails</HI> you may have; but <HI>Bowels</HI> you have none, if you can see the forlorn State of your <HI>Children,</HI> and not have your <HI>Bowels</HI> bleeding over them.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. If once you may see a <HI>perfect heart</HI> in your <HI>Children,</HI> Oh! how well, how well, do you see them therein <HI>provided</HI> for? <HI>Parents,</HI> If you will not <HI>provide</HI> for your <HI>Chil∣dren,</HI> what are you? <HI>Ostriches.</HI> Nay, <HI>Infidels!</HI> Nor is this Term hard enough. You have the Brand of such in 1 Tim. V. 8. <HI>If any pro∣vide not for his own, he is worse than an Infidel.</HI> If your <HI>Children</HI> once come to have a <HI>Perfect Heart</HI> in them, they are <HI>well-provided</HI> for; never till <HI>then!</HI> The Hebrew Word for <HI>peace,</HI> comes from this Root, <HI>Shalam,</HI> to be <HI>perfect.</HI> Verily, They that have a <HI>perfect heart,</HI> have a <HI>Root</HI> of <HI>peace</HI> within them; a <HI>Root</HI> which all the <HI>peaceable fruits of Righteousness</HI> will grow upon. A <HI>perfect peace</HI> will be that which a <HI>perfect heart</HI> will have a Claim unto. A <HI>per∣fect heart</HI> is that <HI>Godliness</HI> which has the <HI>Pro∣mise,</HI> both of the <HI>Life that now is,</HI> and of <HI>that which is to come.</HI> It is <HI>promised</HI> unto the <HI>up∣right walk,</HI> which a <HI>perfect heart</HI> leads unto, <HI>The Lord GOD is a sun and a shield; The Lord will give Grace and Glory; no good thing will he withhold from it.</HI> It may be, you can't lay up any great portion of <HI>Wealth</HI> for your <HI>Children.</HI> Oh! But if you can get a <HI>perfect
<PB N="14" REF="002256_0010_0FDADD498ABF53D8"/>heart</HI> into them; then they have a <HI>Portion,</HI> and a <HI>Goodly Heritage.</HI> Yea the Infinite GOD Himself is their <HI>Portion. Then</HI> you may be sure, that God will be their <HI>Father,</HI> and their <HI>Father</HI> will <HI>know</HI> what they <HI>want</HI> and grant it unto them. You may be sure, That <HI>when Father and Mother forsakes them, the Lord will take them up.</HI> Yea, <HI>Then</HI> you may be sure, that they are not <HI>brought forth for the Murder∣er:</HI> You may be sure, That they shall be <HI>Blessed</HI> with all the <HI>Spiritual Blessings</HI> in the <HI>Heavenly places.</HI> You may be sure, they shall have a share in the <HI>Inheritance of the Saints in Light,</HI> and one Day come to <HI>Inherit all things.</HI> Oh! the <HI>Glad Parents</HI> that can see their <HI>Children</HI> thus Admirably Provided for Yea, I will <HI>bring</HI> you <HI>forth</HI> now, and say unto you, <HI>Look now towards Heaven, and tell the Stars if thou art able <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> number them.</HI> Tell the <HI>very Great and preci∣ous Promises</HI> of God, which glitter like <HI>Stars</HI> in the Firmament, which He has Expanded over His Church; All <HI>These will I give unto thee, and unto thy Offspring,</HI> saith the Lord, <HI>If a perfect heart in you prepare you for it.</HI></P>
<P>THIRDLY. If your <HI>Children</HI> remain desti∣tute of a <HI>perfect heart,</HI> their Condition is, how Deplorable, how Deplorable, how beyond all Expression <HI>Miserable! Parents,</HI> can you see your <HI>Children</HI> in a Slavery to the <HI>powers of dark∣ness,</HI> and <HI>serving divers Lusts,</HI> worse of it than any Slaves on the Coast of <HI>Barbary,</HI> and
<PB N="15" REF="002256_0010_0FDADD498ABF53D8"/>not be in anguish to see them set at <HI>Liberty!</HI> Can you see your <HI>Children,</HI> fallen into the cruel Fangs of <HI>Lyons</HI> or of <HI>Tygers;</HI> and not with Agony call for some help unto them! Can you see your <HI>Children</HI> fast asleep in an <HI>House on Fire</HI> over their heads; and not fly with Agony to help them out of the Flames! This is their very Condition. And nothing, I say unto you, nothing but a <HI>Perfect Heart</HI> brought into them, can Save them out of it. Strangers to a <HI>perfect heart,</HI> they <HI>Dye in their Sins;</HI> Dye, so that it had been <HI>Good for them, they had never been born.</HI> Be you and your <HI>Children</HI> what you will, if they never have a <HI>perfect heart</HI> produced in them, the Great GOD says upon them, as in Amos IX. 7. <HI>Are ye not as Children of the Ethiopians unto me, saith the Lord!</HI> Yea, because in the <HI>Church-state</HI> you have them <HI>Lifted up to Heaven,</HI> their Damnation will be more Dreadful, and a Deeper and Hotter Hell will be assign'd unto them, than what shall be inflicted on the <HI>Children of Ethiopians.</HI> Your <HI>Children,</HI> have upon them the <HI>spots</HI> that show they are <HI>not the Children of GOD,</HI> until a <HI>perfect heart</HI> have taken away those Ugly and Filthy <HI>spots.</HI> But then whose are they? The <HI>heart</HI> of your <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> has in it, the <HI>seeds</HI> of Eternal <HI>Death,</HI> the <HI>Worms</HI> that will never <HI>Dye.</HI> The Dispositi∣ons in the <HI>Carnal Mind</HI> of your <HI>Children,</HI> are such, that they <HI>cannot please GOD</HI> in them: They are full of <HI>Enmity to GOD.</HI> The Holy GOD can be no other but a <HI>Consuming Fire</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="002256_0011_0FDADD4B27A65078"/>unto them, until they have an <HI>Heart</HI> other∣wise Disposed. GOD will be <HI>Terrible</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to them in His Holy <HI>places;</HI> yea, Fearful to be spoken! The <HI>Holy places</HI> themselves can∣not but be <HI>Terrible,</HI> uneasy, ungrateful to them; they will not be able to breath in so pure an Element. Nothing but a <HI>perfect heart</HI> can Save them from the <HI>Wrath to come.</HI> They are Fuel for the <HI>Devouring Fire</HI> and the <HI>Ever∣lasting Burnings,</HI> until a <HI>perfect heart</HI> has giv∣en another Temper to them. Oh! If you would not have these <HI>Children</HI> cast into the <HI>place of Dragons,</HI> or would not yourselves be <HI>such</HI> unto them, you must be in pain to get a <HI>perfect heart</HI> into them. They are undone, <HI>undone;</HI>—Till this be done for them.</P>
<P>FOURTHLY. The <HI>perfect heart,</HI> which is the ONE THING to be <HI>Desired</HI> for your <HI>Chil∣dren,</HI> and what should be <HI>sought after;</HI> Where is it? Whence comes it? Who gives it? Sure∣ly, none but the <HI>GOD of all Grace</HI> can give it. It is the Glorious GOD, who says, Ezek. XXXVI. 26. <HI>A new heart will I give you.</HI> If we could our selves give a <HI>perfect heart</HI> unto our <HI>Children,</HI> and fill their <HI>Heart</HI> with the <HI>Love</HI> of their GOD and their Neighbour, and a <HI>Zeal</HI> to do Good, what Virtuous <HI>Parents</HI> would not presently do it with all their Heart? <HI>Lord, It should be the First Thing that we would presently do for our Children;</HI> T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>make them Thy Children.</HI> But it is Beyond us. It is Above us. A very Distinguishing stroke
<PB N="17" REF="002256_0011_0FDADD4B27A65078"/>and beat of a <HI>perfect heart</HI> is, a <HI>Faith</HI> in the only SAVIOUR; a Flight unto Him for His <HI>Great Salvation.</HI> But whose <HI>Gift</HI> is this! We are told, Eph. II. 8. <HI>Faith is the Gift of God.</HI> And so, we are else-where told more than once, That <HI>GOD gives Repentance.</HI> A <HI>perfect heart,</HI> which is always a very <HI>Tender</HI> one; 'tis a <HI>Stone</HI> turn'd into <HI>Flesh.</HI> Who but the Almighty GOD can do such a Thing as that? <HI>Create in us a clean heart,</HI> O our GOD. It is a <HI>Creating Work,</HI> to make a <HI>perfect heart.</HI> None but GOD the <HI>Creator</HI> of all things, can do such a Thing. <HI>This is my Glory, saith the Lord, and my Glory I will not give unto a∣nother.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly. PRAYER, PRAYER, to the <HI>GOD of all Grace,</HI> is not this the Way to ob∣tain the <HI>Gift?</HI> By pouring out your <HI>Prayer</HI> to a Gracious GOD for it, you may obtain of Him. So we are taught, concerning the Bles∣sing of a <HI>perfect heart;</HI> Ezek. XXXVI. 27. <HI>I will be enquired of on the behalf of the house of Israel, to do it for them.</HI> [It should be ren∣dred so.] When <HI>Parents</HI> do with unceasing Fervour implore our Good GOD, that He would please to do this <HI>Good</HI> unto their <HI>Chil∣dren;</HI> To <HI>make them Good, and upright in Heart;</HI> it is a sign, that He will at some time or other do it for them. Our Good GOD is willing to bestow the Grace of a <HI>Perfect Heart,</HI> when He is asked for it. Nay, there is no Case, wherein that Word is oftner fulfill'd, than it
<PB N="18" REF="002256_0012_0FDADD4C8E078998"/>is in This; <HI>Ask, and it shall be given you.</HI> Not is there any <HI>Prayer</HI> more grateful unto GOD, than This. <HI>Parents,</HI> There is nothing for which you can go to GOD with more of En∣couragement and Expectation; <HI>O Do Thou give a perfect Heart unto this Child; The Heart of thy Children; O my GOD.</HI> I can lead you to a Word, worth more than a Rock of Dia∣monds, or a Mountain of Gold! It is that Word, Luk. XI. 13. <HI>If you that are Evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more shall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit unto them that ask Him?</HI> What a ravishing Word is This! <HI>Quicken'd</HI> by it, Oh, Go now to your <HI>Heavenly Father,</HI> not only for your selves, but also for your Children. With Tears beg it of Him; <HI>O my Father, I long, I long for it, That my Children may be thy Servants. O my SAVIOUR, if Thou will allow of it, the Descent of thy Holy SPIRIT upon them will make them so. O my GOD, Let thy Good SPIRIT lead them into the Land of Rectitude O SPIRIT of Grace, do thou take possession of them.</HI> 'Tis very certain, That if GOD give His <HI>Holy SPIRIT</HI> unto your <HI>Children,</HI> the <HI>Holy SPIRIT</HI> will give a <HI>perfect heart</HI> unto them. The Holy SPIRIT will <HI>Renew a right Spirit</HI> in them; will <HI>Purify their Heart</HI> by a <HI>Faith</HI> of His Working there; will make them the <HI>Temples</HI> of GOD. The Holy SPIRIT will <HI>write his Laws</HI> in their Heart, and <HI>Rectify</HI> all Dis∣orders there, &amp; bring all things to rights with in them. Yea, as we Read, That when the Ho∣ly
<PB N="19" REF="002256_0012_0FDADD4C8E078998"/>SPIRIT first fell on the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> the Spec∣tators <HI>were astonished</HI> at what they saw: The Holy SPIRIT falling on your <HI>Children,</HI> you will see Things done for them, that will fill you with <HI>Astonishment;</HI> but, Oh! What Sa∣tisfaction! Oh! What Consolation! <HI>Ask, Ask,</HI> and see what will be done for you.</P>
<P>BUT then, it must be Remembred, That your <HI>Prayer</HI> for the Renovation of your Children, and their <HI>thus passing from Death to Life,</HI> must have Two Concomitants.</P>
<P>First; YOUR SAVIOUR has told you, That <HI>Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</HI> Your <HI>Prayers</HI> for your <HI>Children</HI> must be, Oh! how Importunate; — such as compassionate Heaven uses to give no Denial to! <HI>Prayers, and Supplications, with strong Crying, and Tears,</HI> to Him that is <HI>Able to Save</HI> your Children from the <HI>Death,</HI> which you are <HI>Afraid</HI> will <HI>feed</HI> upon them! Oh! Plead with a Compassionate GOD, as a Soul <HI>Wrestling</HI> with Him, and <HI>Weeping</HI> in <HI>Supplications,</HI> that will humbly protest, <HI>Lord, I will not let thee go, except Thou Bless the Chil∣dren, and put thy fear into them!</HI> Humbly Plead with Him His <HI>Promise,</HI> and shew Him His own <HI>Hand-Writing;</HI> Even that Word, on which He has <HI>caused you to hope;</HI> Isai. XLIV. 3. <HI>I will pour my Spirit upon thy seed, and my Blessing upon thine offspring.</HI> Do thus, until the <HI>New-born-Child</HI> shall be called a SAMUEL, and you may say, <HI>I have asked him and gained him of the Lord.</HI> But then, The <HI>Importunity</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="002256_0013_0FDADD4E06B55C88"/>of your <HI>Prayers</HI> must especially be expressed in the <HI>Perpetuity</HI> of them. The <HI>Mercy</HI> of seeing your <HI>Children turned from Darkness unto Light, and from the power of Satan unto GOD</HI> perhaps will not be presently granted you Nay, you may see, as in the Grant of every <HI>Special Mercy</HI> it uses to be, a <HI>Sentence of Death</HI> long written upon it, before you receive it. A GOD who <HI>waits that He may be Gra¦cious,</HI> will have this <HI>Mercy waited</HI> for: Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Mercy</HI> is worth <HI>waiting</HI> for: And if you don't grow <HI>weary</HI> of calling upon GOD but still follow Him with your <HI>Incessan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prayers,</HI> O you that keep <HI>Sewing in Tears</HI> you shall anon see a comfortable <HI>Harvest</HI> You shall find, That the <HI>Lord is Good unto them that wait for Him, unto the Soul that seek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Him.</HI> There will be a <HI>Month,</HI> wherein GOD will find these <HI>Wild Children,</HI> and make <HI>New Creatures</HI> of them. It may be, O <HI>Hezekia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> GOD will by'nd by throw thy Wicked <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦nasseh</HI> into the <HI>Chains</HI> of such Afflictions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> such Convictions, as will compel him to <HI>See<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the GOD of his Father.</HI> My Friend, Crying <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thy SAVIOUR, that thy Child may be fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> from the <HI>Devils</HI> that have possession of it, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may appear Deaf unto thy Cry; He ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seem to treat thee like a <HI>Dog.</HI> But still, Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> on! Hold on! <HI>Pray on! O my SAVIOUR ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Mercy on my sinful Child, and let no Devil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>¦tain him from thy Service!</HI> Do so, until the hear Him say, <HI>Great is thy Faith; Be it un<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> thee as thou wilt!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="002256_0013_0FDADD4E06B55C88"/>
Secondly. YOUR <HI>Pains</HI> must accompany your <HI>Prayers.</HI> You must <HI>Instruct</HI> your <HI>Chil∣dren,</HI> you must <HI>Advise</HI> your <HI>Children,</HI> as well as Pray for them; <HI>speak to</HI> them, as well as <HI>for</HI> them. You must <HI>Restrain</HI> them, and use all the Methods of Prudence to keep them from the <HI>Paths of the Destroyer;</HI> use all the Methods of <HI>Wisdom,</HI> to <HI>win their Souls,</HI> and <HI>spread the nets of Salvation</HI> for them, to see a <HI>CHRIST formed in them.</HI> Not only <HI>Pray</HI> for the <HI>Children,</HI> but also lay the <HI>Charges</HI> of GOD up∣on them: Like <HI>David</HI> who <HI>Charged Solomon his Son,</HI> and said, <HI>Keep the Charge of the Lord thy GOD, to walk in His Ways.</HI> On! with all possible solemnity lay upon them those <HI>Char∣ges,</HI> 1 Chron. XXVIII. 9. <HI>Know thou the God, of thy father and serve him.</HI> Take them aside, and <HI>Charge</HI> them immediately to <HI>consider th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in Ways,</HI> and look into the state of their Souls. <HI>Charge</HI> them, with Distressed Souls, to Em∣brace an Offered SAVIOUR with all His <HI>Be∣nefits; Charge</HI> them, to keep up the <HI>Religion of the Closet,</HI> and Read the <HI>Word,</HI> and seek the <HI>Face</HI> of GOD in their daily Retirements. And <HI>Charge</HI> them; to shun dangerous Compa∣ny; to <HI>Forsake the Foolish and Live;</HI> And Re∣member the <HI>Bonds</HI> of GOD, that in their <HI>Baptism</HI> were laid upon them. Yea, then cause them to kneel down by you, and make them the <HI>Witnesses</HI> of the <HI>Weeping Supplicati∣ons,</HI> with which you carry them unto the Lord. Not only the <HI>Servants,</HI> but also the <HI>Handmaids</HI> of the Lord, have done thus; And
<PB N="22" REF="002256_0014_0FDADD4F9BEC54A8"/>the <HI>Success</HI> of it on their <HI>Children</HI> has been ad∣mirable! But then there is one thing more to be Expected from you. <HI>Parents,</HI> Be <HI>Pat∣terns:</HI> let your <HI>Children</HI> see in you, the <HI>Pat∣terns</HI> of <HI>All Goodness.</HI> Be <HI>Exemplary;</HI> with <HI>Holiness in all manner of Conversation,</HI> give them an <HI>Example</HI> of a Prayerful, Watchful, Fruitful <HI>walk with GOD.</HI> In you let them see how <HI>they</HI> should <HI>walk,</HI> that GOD may be pleased with them. When <HI>Elisha</HI> was con∣cerned for a <HI>Double Portion</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> that had been in his Predecessor, <HI>Elijah</HI> told him, that if he <HI>saw him</HI> at his mounting up to <HI>Hea∣ven,</HI> he should have it. This may be, and has been, so far alluded to; Oh! if your <HI>Children</HI> may see you going to <HI>Heaven,</HI> and may see the <HI>Heavenly Flights</HI> of your Souls, in your Contempt of <HI>Earth,</HI> your Horror at <HI>Sin,</HI> your Value for CHRIST, and your Com∣munion with GOD; there would probably fall upon them, a <HI>Mighty Portion</HI> of the <HI>Spirit</HI> which you desire for them; the <HI>Spirit</HI> of PIETY, which you have desired for them.</P>
<P N="3">III. IT is now Time, for our <HI>Children</HI> to be∣come sensible of an <HI>Inference,</HI> which there can be no avoiding of.

<P>Come ye Children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE <HI>Title</HI> of this Psalm shows, that holy <HI>David</HI> was the Author of it. He had been in eminent Danger among the <HI>Philistines,</HI> God Graciously &amp; Wonderfully deli∣vered him; &amp; his Heart was fill'd with holy Gratitude to God for this Deliverance. He said, v. 1. <HI>I will bless the Lord at all times, his praise shall be continually in my mouth.</HI> He stir'd up <HI>himself</HI> and <HI>others</HI> too, to Bless and Praise God for the great Deliverance He had favour∣ed him with. v. 3. <HI>O magnifie the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.</HI> Indeed,
<PB N="2" REF="002256_0021_0FDAC96FD6C8BF98"/>God the Inexhaustible Fountain of Living Wa∣ters, is freely and <HI>Communicatively Good</HI> to all that Sincerely Seek and Serve Him. <HI>David</HI> therefore Exhorts to such a <HI>Seeking</HI> and <HI>Serv∣ing</HI> of God. v. 8, 9, 10. <HI>O taste and see that the Lord is good: blessed is the man that trusteth in him — there is no want to them that fear him — they that seek the Lord shall not want any good thing.</HI> Our Text it self is of the same General strain, Namely, to Incite and Quick∣en others to Seek and Serve God. <HI>Come ye Children</HI> (says <HI>David</HI>) <HI>hearken unto me,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>David,</HI> by God's <HI>Command</HI> was anointed <HI>King,</HI> (1 Sam. 16.12.) and by his <HI>Spirit</HI> was made a <HI>Prophet,</HI> (Act. 2.29, 30.) this holy Man, this true Saint, this royal Prophet, said, <HI>Come ye Children.</HI> He gives them the kind compel∣lation of <HI>Children,</HI> which notes, his <HI>tender, pa∣ternal regard</HI> to them; (<HI>Like as a father piti∣eth his children,</HI> Psal. 103.13.) and the <HI>Dispo∣sition</HI> which was (or <HI>should</HI> have been) i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them, viz. that they were as <HI>ductile, tractable, teachable</HI> as <HI>Children</HI> are (or should be) ready to receive wholesome Instructions, and good Impressions on their Minds. <HI>Come</HI> ye Chil∣dren, <HI>Come,</HI> indeed its worth your while to <HI>come;</HI> well worth your while to <HI>Hear, Learn, Observe</HI> the things I have to <HI>Teach</HI> you, viz. to <HI>Fear God.</HI> So <HI>Children,</HI> mind what I say, it's well worth your while to <HI>come,</HI> to <HI>come</HI> from <HI>Sabbath</HI> to <HI>Sabbath,</HI> from <HI>Lecture</HI> to <HI>Lecture,</HI> to imbrace all Opportunities, to improve all pro∣per seasons, to be Instructed in and Quicken∣ed
<PB N="3" REF="002256_0021_0FDAC96FD6C8BF98"/>to, what's for the Good of your Souls, your precious Immortal Souls which are of more worth than a World. Well, says <HI>David,</HI> come ye Children and I'll <HI>teach you.</HI> Teach what, why the <HI>Fear of the Lord.</HI> He would <HI>teach</HI> them to be Sincerely and <HI>Practically Religious;</HI> to <HI>Know, Trust</HI> in, <HI>Love, Fear, Serve, Obey God,</HI> so as to be Happy in His Favour. He would <HI>teach</HI> them what was most <HI>needful, useful, pro∣fitable</HI> to them.</P>
<P>HERE we may Observe, that true Saving Graces are inseperably connected together, they all spring from the same Regenerating, Renewing Change wrought in the Soul; from the Image of God Renewed in, &amp; impressed on the Heart by the Holy Spirit. Where there's one Saving Grace, there are all Saving Gra∣ces. Agreeably whereto we find, that the general Comprehensive Blessings of the New-Covenant, are sometimes pronounc'd concern∣ing Persons, as endow'd with <HI>this or that par∣ticular Grace.</HI> Thus, Blessed is the Man that <HI>Trusteth</HI> in the Lord. Jer. 17.7. So, There are inconceivable Treasures of <HI>Goodness</HI> stor'd up for those that <HI>Love</HI> God. 1 Cor. 2.9. Again, Blessed is the Man that <HI>Feareth</HI> the Lord, that <HI>Delighteth</HI> greatly in His Command∣ments, Psal. 112.1. Therefore <HI>by the Fear of the Lord,</HI> spoken of in our Text, we may un∣derstand <HI>Universal Piety,</HI> even all that <HI>Know∣ledge, Faith, Repentance, Love, Fear, Hope,</HI> Holy <HI>Obedience,</HI> which the Gospel requires as ne∣cessary in order to our happiness. The <HI>Fear
<PB N="4" REF="002256_0022_0FDADD5F67235538"/>of the Lord,</HI> in our Text, seems to be of the same extent with, Eccl. 12.13. <HI>Fear God and keep his Commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.</HI> 1 Pet. 1.17. <HI>Pass the time of your sojourning here in fear.</HI> In <HI>fear,</HI> that is, in a serious consciencious regard to all that God <HI>teaches</HI> you, and <HI>requires</HI> of you. From the Text thus opened, we might <HI>note,</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>(1.) <HI>That those who have true Piety themselves</HI> (as the <HI>Psal∣mist</HI> speaking in our Text, had) <HI>will be willing to be at pains, to promote the like Piety in others.</HI> If Piety be suitably awake and active in them, they'l not grudge the taking pains to <HI>teach, exhort, incite</HI> others to know and serve God. They'l be for <HI>provoking others to love and good works,</HI> Heb. 10.24. They will have <HI>no greater joy, than to hear that others walk in the truth,</HI> Joh. 3 Ep. v. 4.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(2.) <HI>So excellent is Early Pie∣ty, that it's not beneath the greatest and best of Men, to endeavour the promoting it.</HI> Tho' <HI>Da∣vid</HI> was anointed to be <HI>King,</HI> and was a <HI>Pro∣phet;</HI> yet he thought it not below or beneath him, to <HI>Instruct</HI> others, even <HI>Young Ones, Chil∣dren,</HI> to <HI>Fear the Lord.</HI> I acknowledge, the Word <HI>Banime, Sons,</HI> here rendred <HI>Children,</HI> strict∣ly taken is not limitted to <HI>Young Ones;</HI> yet since it's here rend red <HI>Children,</HI> &amp; may well extend to <HI>Young Ones,</HI> (tho' not exclusive of others) shall at present speak to the Text, chiefly as it con∣cerns <HI>Persons while Young.</HI> And indeed the best and greatest Persons, in their several Sta∣tions and Capacities, should do what they can to incourage and promote true Piety in such.
<PB N="5" REF="002256_0022_0FDADD5F67235538"/><HI>Magistrates</HI> in their Places, by incouraging <HI>Schools</HI> and <HI>Colleges; Ministers</HI> in their Places, by <HI>Publick and Private Instructions;</HI> should strive to promote true Piety in Young Persons.</ITEM>
<ITEM>(3.) <HI>Good Instructions</HI> (or teachings) <HI>ordinarily are needful in order to the fear of God, or true Practical Piety.</HI> I will <HI>teach</HI> you the <HI>fear of the Lord.</HI> Man is born as a <HI>Wild Asses Colt,</HI> (Job. 11.12.) He needs to be <HI>taught</HI> the right way, in order to his <HI>walking</HI> in it. Prov. 19.2. <HI>That the Soul be without knowledge, it is not good.</HI> Sound knowledge is needful, in order to a right practice. He will <HI>teach</HI> us of His ways, and we will <HI>walk</HI> in His paths, <HI>Mic.</HI> 4.2. If ye <HI>know</HI> these things, happy are ye if ye <HI>do</HI> them, <HI>Job.</HI> 13.17. But the Doctrine I design chiefly to insist on at present, is this, <HI>viz.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> THAT Children, Young Persons should make it their chief, principal care and business to Fear God, to be Sincerely and Practically Pious.</HEAD>
<P>THIS, this was the thing which the Royal Prophet in our Text, was so sollicitous to in∣culcate on <HI>Children,</HI> namely, <HI>to Fear God.</HI> As soon as <HI>Children</HI> become capable of acting as rational Creatures, by deliberately considering things, by intelligently chusing and refusing; even <HI>then</HI> (and afterwards forever) they should <HI>fear God;</HI> should make it their chief endea∣vour to <HI>please</HI> Him, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they may <HI>enjoy</HI> Him. This truly, is the one thing needful; all other
<PB N="6" REF="002256_0023_0FDADD60DA4D4AA8"/>matters are baubles and trifles compar'd to this. Here's the truest <HI>Wisdom</HI> they can ma∣nifest. <HI>The fear of the Lord, that is wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding,</HI> Job. 28.28. Therefore Persons should, <HI>remember their Creator in the days of their Youth,</HI> Eccl. 12.1. God gives them great incouragement to do so, in saying, Prov. 8.17. <HI>I love them that love me, and they that seek me early shall find me.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now endeavour in some measure to describe the <HI>Nature of Early Piety,</HI> shewing what it is, wherein it does consist, how or wherein it should exert or exemplify it self.</P>
<P>HERE therefore we may Enquire,</P>
<P>Quest. <HI>WHAT's here imply'd or comprehend∣ed, in Childrens fearing of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> THEIR <HI>searing of God</HI> according to the sense of our Text, may well comprehend in it these following things, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THEIR believing of, and meditating on, the Being and Attributes of God.</HI> The <HI>belief</HI> of a God of an Eternal Power and God-Head, of a being infinitely perfect, that is the Maker and Go∣vernour of all things; is the very Founda∣tion, the first Article of all true Religion. He that does not believe there is a GOD, can neither <HI>Love</HI> nor <HI>Fear</HI> Him. Heb. 11.6. <HI>With∣out faith it is impossible to please God; for be that cometh to God, must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently
<PB N="7" REF="002256_0023_0FDADD60DA4D4AA8"/>seek him.</HI> God is indeed Infinite, Eternal, Unchangeable in His <HI>Being, Wisdom, Power Holiness, Justice, Goodness</HI> and <HI>Truth.</HI> He's the Sovereign Maker, Preserver, Supream Lord and Governour of all Creatures: <HI>He does according to his will, in the Armies of Hea∣ven, and among the Inhabitants of the Earth,</HI> Dan. 4.35. God has made Men for <HI>Eternity,</HI> and they shall be Eternally happy or misera∣ble, according as they submit to or rebel a∣gainst, Him their Maker, Lawgiver and Judge. It's therefore the indispensible Duty, and un∣deniable Interest of all Persons <HI>Young</HI> as well as <HI>Old,</HI> to <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>obey</HI> God. A firm <HI>belief</HI> of such things as these, is necessarily imply'd in, or absolutely necessary in order to, a <HI>right fear∣ing of God.</HI> Children therefore can't have their thoughts &amp; <HI>Meditations</HI> better imploy'd, than on the <HI>Being</HI> and <HI>Perfections</HI> of God. Children are apt to have their Meditations run much on empty bubbles and vanities; but when they're duly exercis'd on God and His matchless Excellencies, it's the most pro∣per and noble Imployment they can possibly be engaged in.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THEIR Hearty, Studious, Diligent ac∣quainting themselves, with God's Will Revealed in His written Word.</HI> How far those utterly un∣acquainted with the Scriptures, are capable of Knowing and Fearing God; I shall not now inquire. But those <HI>Young ones</HI> Refer'd to in our Text, were the <HI>Children of the Covenant,</HI> the Children of God's Professing People, to
<PB N="8" REF="002256_0024_0FDADD663A60E2A0"/>whom He gave His <HI>Word, Statutes,</HI> and <HI>Judg∣ments</HI> tho' He dealt not so with every Nation Psal. 147.19, 20. Rom. 3.12. If <HI>Young</HI> Per∣sons among a Professing People, would right∣ly <HI>Fear</HI> God, they should Diligently Study His <HI>Will,</HI> to <HI>Direct</HI> them in it, and <HI>Quicken</HI> them to it: For His <HI>Revealed Will,</HI> show<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what He Forbids, what He Requires, and what Obligations they're under to Obey Him He has <HI>shewed them what is good, and what b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> requires of them,</HI> (Mic. 6.8.) this He has do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the <HI>holy Scriptures, which are able to ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> wise unto salvation, thro' faith in Christ Jesus</HI> 2 Tim. 3.15. <HI>Timothy</HI> in his <HI>Childhood</HI> kne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those Scriptures, and so should others also <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ven while they are <HI>Children.</HI> The Scripture are God's Law, they are Christ's Love-Lett<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to His People, they are the Saints Chart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> containing the Priviledges belonging to them <HI>Children</HI> therefore should maintain a Dilige<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Constant Practice of <HI>Reading the Holy Scrip∣tures;</HI> of regarding them as <HI>the light of the feet, and lamp of their paths,</HI> Psal. 119.10. <HI>Search the Scriptures,</HI> (Joh. 5.39.) <HI>Let the wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Christ dwell in you richly.</HI> Meditate on Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Law, <HI>night and day,</HI> (Psal. 1.2.) <HI>Hide it your hearts, that you may not sin against God: Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? taking heed thereto according to thy word,</HI> Psal. 119.9, 11. O Children, you can't right <HI>Fear</HI> and Serve God, unless you're acquaint with His Revealed Will. You must <HI>Know<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Will,</HI> else you can't <HI>Do</HI> it; what He <HI>Forbid</HI>

Study to <HI>Know</HI> God's Will, both as a <HI>Part</HI> and as a <HI>Means,</HI> of that <HI>Fear</HI> you owe to Him: As a <HI>Part</HI> of it, for it's what He <HI>Requires.</HI> 1 Chron. 28.9. <HI>Know thou the God of thy Fathers.</HI> Rom. 12.2. <HI>That ye may prove what is that good, and accep∣table and perfect will of God.</HI> Hos. 4.6. <HI>My people is destroyed for lack of knowledge; because thou hast rejected knowledge, I also will reject thee.</HI> Again, Study Gods will, as a <HI>Means</HI> of that <HI>Fear</HI> you owe to Him. <HI>Practice,</HI> is the <HI>end</HI> that should be aim'd at in Seeking <HI>know∣ledge.</HI> We should Study to <HI>Know</HI> God's Holy Will, with a Purpose, Desire and Design to <HI>Do</HI> it, to conform to it. Josh. 1.8.

It shows you how to get <HI>Peace</HI> with God, how to <HI>Please</HI> Him, how to <HI>Honour Christ</HI> and get <HI>Honour</HI> in His Sight; it shows you how to get <HI>Pardon</HI> of Sin, how to behave yourselves in every Station and Con∣dition, how to get a <HI>Sanctified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e of Providences,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002256_0025_0FDADD684FDE2240"/>how to save your Souls, to escape Hell, to get to Heaven, and possess Eternal Glory. O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> let this best of Books, be the chief Subject of your study and meditation. How much time is wretchedly mispent, thrown away, lost, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reading <HI>Play-Books,</HI> or <HI>filthy</HI> and <HI>profane</HI> Writ∣ings! But seriously and diligently to read and study the <HI>Holy Bible,</HI> is one good Mean to make us <HI>wise to Salvation,</HI> holy in Time and Happy to <HI>Eternity.</HI> Again, for <HI>Children</HI> rightly to <HI>Fear God,</HI> implies,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>THE serious Consideration, of their natu∣rally sinful and guilty state.</HI> If Young Person seriously read and study God's Word, and con∣sider what's therein contained; they mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> needs see, that as they proceed from falle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Apostate Adam, they're unspeakably vile, fil∣thy, guilty. They were <HI>shapen in iniquities</HI> and <HI>conceived in Sin,</HI> (Psal. 51.5.) their <HI>hearts are deceitful above all things, and desperate wicked,</HI> (Jer. 17.9.) their <HI>carnal minds are en∣mity against God, not subject to his law, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> indeed can be,</HI> (Rom. 8.7.)

<PB N="11" REF="002256_0025_0FDADD684FDE2240"/>against Him, eagerly set in pursuing Vanities, on provoking God by actual Personal trans∣gressions, whereby they merit and deserve <HI>greater measures</HI> of Wrath. And while they continue in such a state, Sin reigning and tyranizing in them, Guilt lying on them; I say, while so, they have no true fear of God before their Eyes, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 3.18.) They have not that <HI>Fear of God</HI> which is acceptable to Him. They that are <HI>in the flesh cannot please God,</HI> Rom. 8.8. While they're in this state, they can yield no acceptable Service to God, nor have they any title to His pardoning Mercy, or reconciled Favour. Truly it behoves them most seriously to consider how filthy, guilty, odious, abominable they are both by nature and by practice. They should see their <HI>Sick∣ness,</HI> and so their <HI>need</HI> of a <HI>Physician;</HI> their <HI>danger</HI> of the pursuing Wrath of God, and so their <HI>need</HI> of <HI>refuge,</HI> Mat. 9.12. Heb. 6.18. Their rightly <HI>fearing of God,</HI> implies,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THEIR turning from Sin to God in Christ Jesus.</HI> The Lord Jesus Christ, God and Man in One Person, is the only <HI>Mediator</HI> between <HI>God and Men,</HI> (1 Tim. 2.5.) the <HI>Only</HI> and <HI>All-sufficient Saviour of Sinners,</HI> Act. 4.12.

It's only in and thro' this blessed Me∣diator and Redeemer, that Sinners can obtain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ardon of Sin, Peace, Friendship, Reconcilia∣tion with God. <HI>God is in Christ reconciling
<PB N="12" REF="002256_0026_0FDADD69C5589760"/>the World unto himself,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.19. God can be <HI>Just</HI> and the <HI>Justifier of him that believes in Jesus,</HI> Rom. 3.26. Indeed the Spirit of God must set in, with His Word, and make it efficacious to convince the Soul of it's Sin, Guilt, Dan∣ger, and to draw it to Christ, trusting only in His Meritorious Righteousness for Pardon Peace and Reconciliation with God. <HI>Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God,</HI> Joh. 3.3.

Oh Children, this is t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> one thing needful, most needful, most profi∣table. Don't think it enough that you were born of Christian Parents, that you were Baptized, Educated, Instructed in the tr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Christian Religion, that hitherto you've l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> blameless Religious Lives to outward ap∣pearance;
<PB N="13" REF="002256_0026_0FDADD69C5589760"/>all these things may possibly be true of many Hypocrites, all these things may be true of you, and yet you perish forever. See to it therefore, that you Heartily Repent of Sin, and Submit to Christ as Prince and Savi∣our. <HI>Repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> (Act. 20.21.) are the Great Things Inculcated in the Gospel. The Scope of the Gospel is, <HI>to turn men from darkness to light, from the power of Satan unto God; that they may receive the forgiveness of Sins, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an inheritance among them that are Sanctify'd by Faith</HI> in Christ, Acts 28.18. There∣fore Content not yourselves, with any thing short of an Hearty Submission to the Calls of the Gospel. Don't think 'twill be Time enough to mind your Souls hereafter; don't indulge yourselves in any vicious Cour∣ses, in any ways of known Wickedness, there∣by Provoking God, Dishonouring Christ, Re∣sisting the Holy Ghost, grieving your Pious Pa∣rents and Neighbours, gratifying the Devil, and Treasuring up Wrath against the Day of Wrath. Don't be Agents for Hell, Factors for the Devil, hastening to, and ripening for Damnation.

<P>THUS I've given some few General hints, Shewing what's Implied in <HI>Childrens,</HI> Young Ones, <HI>Fearing of God,</HI> or being <HI>Practically Pi∣ous.</HI> We may say by way of USE,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>IT's matter of Lamentation, that there's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more of this Fear of God appearing in the Chil∣dren, the Young Persons, among this People.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to be hop'd indeed, that there are many Children, Young Persons among this People, who <HI>Remember their Creator;</HI> who <HI>Fear the Lord in their Youth,</HI> and give comfortable Evi∣dences of their Sincere Piety. Yet it's mat∣ter of Great Lamentation, that there are no more such. Are there not many <HI>Young Per∣sons,</HI> who show little if any Regard to God, to Christ, to the Welfare of their Precious Immortal Souls? Are there not many <HI>Young</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="002256_0033_0FDADD796878F640"/>Ones, who seldom if ever Read God's Holy Word, unless (as 'twere) constrain'd or com∣pell'd to it? Many who scarce Learn, or soon Forget, their <HI>Catechism,</HI> that form of sound Words? Many who give little if any Reason to think, that they retire <HI>Morning</HI> and <HI>Even∣ing</HI> for <HI>Secret Prayer?</HI> Many who show little if any Regard to God's Holy <HI>Sabbath,</HI> but ra∣ther Profane it by <HI>Playing, Idleness,</HI> Worldly and <HI>vain Discourses,</HI> Neglects of <HI>Private</HI> and <HI>Publick</HI> Exercises of <HI>Religious Worship?</HI> How Few are there comparatively, that when they are grown up do seriously Renew their Bap∣tismal Covenant, and seriously Approach to the Lord's Table? Alas, how many are there, who evidently Disregard their <HI>Baptismal De∣dication</HI> to God? Tho' in Baptism they have been Solemnly Dedicated, Consecrated to the Service of God; and are Oblig'd with Body and Soul to Glorify God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost; yet when grown up, don't they seem <HI>Practically</HI> to Re∣nounce the God of their Fathers, to cast off the hope of their Fathers; and to imploy their Bodies and Souls in the Service of the Devil, and their own Lusts and Corruptions? Nay, are there not some Young Persons, Children of the Covenant, Baptized Ones, that are very <HI>Ignorant</HI> of Christianity; nay, some will take <HI>God's Holy Name in vain,</HI> will <HI>Curse</HI> and <HI>Swear Profanely?</HI> Such are Guilty of horrid Sacriledge, they Rob God, their Persons which were Consecrated to God,

Surely such Things as these, ought to be deeply be∣wail'd and lamented. All that have at Hea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Cause of God, the Honour of Christ, th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Good of this People; should bewail what<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> amiss among us, and Pray for the Out pou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of God's Spirit for the Mending and Reform∣ing of it.</ITEM>

<ITEM>3. <HI>ALL that are concern'd with Children, with Young Persons, should strive to Incourage and Promote true Piety in them. Parents</HI> should do so, <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Mistresses</HI> in <HI>Families,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n <HI>Schools,</HI> should do so; <HI>Ministers</HI> should do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, Feeding the <HI>Lambs</HI> as well as the <HI>Sheep</HI> of Christ's Flock. Godliness is profitable for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>present and future life,</HI> 1 Tim. 4.8. All, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n their several Stations and Capacities, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hould Incourage and Promote what is so pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>table. Nothing is more Threatening to the Welfare of a People, than to have their <HI>Young Ones</HI> generally <HI>Ignorant, Irreligious, Dis∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rderly.</HI> When it is so, it looks as tho' Ini∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uity would soon abound, to the pulling <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>own heavy Judgments. So, nothing looks more <HI>Promising,</HI> than to have their Young Ones generally <HI>Fearing</HI> and <HI>Serving</HI> of God. Prov. 14.34. <HI>Righteousness exalteth a nation, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut sin is a reproach to any people.</HI> All proper Methods therefore should be taken, to Pro∣mote true Piety in Young Persons. Psal. 78.—8. <HI>For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he command∣ed our fathers, that they should make them known unto their children. That the generation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come might know them; even the children
<PB N="30" REF="002256_0035_0FDADD7C00F42400"/>which should be born; who should arise and declare them to their children: that they might set their hope in God, and not forget th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> works of God, but keep his Commandments.</HI> When true Practical Religion is thus Propa∣gated among a People from one Generation to another, 'twill be Unspeakably profitable and advantagious to them. Psal. 103.17, 18. <HI>The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to e∣verlasting upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto childrens children; to such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> keep his covenant, and to those that remember his commandments to do them.</HI> Psal. 67.5,—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Let the people praise thee, O God; let all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> people praise thee.

It is the Commandment of God to thee, Prov. 23.22. <HI>Despise not thy Mother when she is old.</HI> Vile and impious is the Youth that does. Deut. 27.16. <HI>Cursed be he that setteth light by his Father or his Mother! and all the people shall say, Amen.</HI> He perishes under a universal Curse: <HI>all</HI> must consent and agree in it. Finally, Piety will teach you to requite your Parents by contributing chearfully to their <HI>Sustenance</HI> and <HI>Support</HI> out of your estate if they stand in need of it. Read <HI>Josephs</HI> filial piety, Gen. 45.9, 10. <HI>Haste you and go up to my Father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy Son Joseph, God hath made me Lord of all Egypt, come down unto me, tarry not;—and here will I nourish you.</HI> CHRIST teaches you, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.4. that the honouring your Fa∣ther and Mother includes <HI>Maintenance and Relief;</HI> and He vehemently condemns the False gloss or <HI>tradition</HI> of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> which taught otherwise. O <HI>Child,</HI> whoever thou art, desire to be unto thy Parents another <HI>Obed,</HI> of whom we read, Ruth. 4.15. <HI>He shall
<PB N="14" REF="002256_0042_0FDADD8ACE5EBDD0"/>be to thee a restorer of thy life, and a nourisher of thy old age.</HI></P>
<P>ONCE more, Piety will teach Children to <HI>pray</HI> for their Parents, and to <HI>thank</HI> GOD for the blessing they have in 'em; reverent∣ly to <HI>rise up and call them blessed;</HI> and to de∣sire their <HI>blessing,</HI> p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ize their prayers, see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that <HI>their Soul may bless</HI> them. You can<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>value</HI> the blessing of pious Parents at too hig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a rate, nor is any <HI>pains</HI> too great to obtai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it; as <HI>Joseph</HI> went with his two Sons to <HI>Ja∣cobs</HI> knees; with utmost reverence and jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But O fear a Parents <HI>Curse!

<P>I shall only add, That Piety will tea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Children to have a just regard to the Wisdo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Advice of Parents, in the <HI>disp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> themselves to <HI>Callings,</HI> into <HI>Families,</HI> or <HI>Marriage;</HI> and when God takes Parents aw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Piety requires their Children to <HI>mourn</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 'em and over them; as <HI>Joseph fell upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Fathers face, and wept upon him and kissed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> as soon as he <HI>gave up the Ghost,</HI> Gen. 50.1.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="002256_0042_0FDADD8ACE5EBDD0"/>
BUT so much of the <HI>Piety of Children to Parents;</HI> on which I have enlarged more than I design on any other <HI>head,</HI> because it is indeed the first and greatest branch of <HI>Early Piety toward Men,</HI> and is to be laid in the founda∣tion of all the following <HI>Instances.</HI> I will only recommend it further from the <HI>Example of</HI> CHRIST; the most blessed and <HI>glorious Pattern</HI> of it. <HI>Children,</HI> When the SON of GOD took our Nature of the blessed <HI>Virgin Mary,</HI> we read of Him that He was <HI>Subject to his Parents,</HI> Luk. 2.51. And as He hung on the <HI>Cross</HI> He cast down a dying look upon his Mother, and said to the <HI>beloved Disciple</HI> who stood by her,—<HI>Behold thy Mother: John</HI> understood the meaning of that gracious en∣dearing word, and <HI>from that hour took her to his own home,</HI> Joh. 19.27. <Q>Thus <HI>Christ</HI> being made of a Woman was made under the Law of the <HI>Fifth Commandment,</HI> to teach the Seed of the Faithful to approve them∣selves unto Him a <HI>Faithful Seed</HI> by their careful observance of this Commandment <HI>David</HI> was a <HI>Type</HI> of CHRIST in this par∣ticular, that in the day of his distress he took care of his exposed Parents, and found a shelter for them. 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 22.3.</Q> But how glorious was the filial piety and dying love of the <HI>Son of David,</HI> who when He was suffering under the weight of His <HI>Eternal Fathers</HI> frowns, and crying out to Him, <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me;</HI> yet found a heart and leisure to look down upon
<PB N="16" REF="002256_0043_0FDADD8F539CEB78"/>his poor <HI>pierced Mothers Soul,</HI> and provide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> her a Son and a Home the few days she ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to outlive Him. O <HI>Children,</HI> imitate yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Saviour</HI> in filial piety. And you that are <HI>Pa¦rents,</HI> exact, require, constrain this Duty, fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and reverence from your Children toward yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or you cruelly abandon them to a reproba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> state; for it is awful to observe to you, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> both Parents and Children have reason to thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of it with trembling, that among the Sins f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> which God gave up the <HI>Heathen</HI> to a repro∣bate mind this is one, <HI>Disobedience to Parents</HI> Rom. 1.30.

But be sure that you be always <HI>true</HI> one to another and just: do not bely nor falsely accuse; nor lie and deny when you are justly accused. Finally, <HI>Children, Pray for one another;</HI> and why should not the Children of the same house pray <HI>with</HI> one another, and teach one another? Show to each other a reverence and fear of God in all your Con∣versation together; put one another upon fear∣ing God and praying to Him, and on avoiding Sin: Especially let each other see that you love and honour the <HI>Holy Bible,</HI> God's holy <HI>Sabbaths,</HI> his <HI>Ministers</HI> and his <HI>Worshippers.</HI> And let the Governours of families teach, require and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead the Children into this pious behaviour one toward another.

3. THERE are SERVANTS in the Family and you must be very good and pious toward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem, or <HI>thou art a Servant</HI> in the family and there is a piety to be expressed by thee to¦ward all that are in the house.

<P>BUT then the <HI>Servants</HI> in a family the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> must shew piety, first to their Master and Mistress, secondly to the Houshold.</P>

<P N="2">2. THERE is a Piety toward the <HI>Housh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to be commended to young persons that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Servants</HI> in families. And this again is, either toward your <HI>Fellow-Servants,</HI> or to the <HI>Chil¦dren</HI> of the Families where you dwell.</P>
<P>TO your <HI>Fellow-Servants</HI> be loving, ki<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, courteous, obliging, grateful; meek, gentle, peaceable; <HI>Study to be quiet and to do your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> business:</HI> assist one another, hear with o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> another: give good Words and give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> good Example: speak to one another of t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

<P>AND then to the <HI>Children</HI> of the family Servants should express their piety, as by carrying toward them with great respect, so with a most endearing love and tender care. Give 'em a good example: teach and instruct 'em as you may be able and there may be occasion: reprove what you see amiss and evil in them; win 'em from it if you can: if there be need threaten 'em to inform their Parents, and be as good as your word if they scorn your words: praise and encourage what is good in 'em, and put 'em upon every thing that is good and holy, ingenuous and com∣mendable. O the extensive Benefit which a Family may receive from a good Servant! think not thou art a dry shrub, that God ex∣pects and that the World can receive nothing from thee: Know it, that you may be an un∣known blessing to the World in your inferior place: desire and endeavour to be so; and God advance thee and enlarge thy opportu∣nities to honour Him. And let Masters and Mistresses cherish and encourage such dispo∣sition
<PB N="22" REF="002256_0046_0FDADD93D3B8A138"/>in their Servants; reward 'em and do 'em honour.</P>
<P>AND thus I have got thro' the <HI>first Head</HI> of Early Piety, in the <HI>Family</HI> to which you belong, and in the <HI>Relation</HI> wherein you stand; as <HI>Children, Brothers</HI> and <HI>Sisters,</HI> or <HI>Servants.</HI></P>
<P>I shall not be so long on the remaining Heads.</P>
<P N="2">II. FROM the <HI>Family</HI> let us pass to the SCHOOL. And here <HI>Children</HI> Consider, it is your <HI>Parents</HI> that put you to School, and it is their <HI>love</HI> and affection to you, their <HI>care</HI> and concern for you, both for your temporal and Eternal good, that makes 'em do it: They do it in duty to GOD, that you may be an in∣structed Seed to serve Him; they do it in duty to the <HI>Public</HI> that you may be blessings in your generation; they could not answer it to GOD or Man; nor to their own Hearts (which love you and fear God) to leave you in your natural <HI>Ignorance</HI> and rudeness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they would be cruel, unnatural and barba¦rous to you, as well as Irreligious toward God not to be thoughtful for your <HI>Education</HI> and instruction; and therefore they put you under the care of Vertuous, prudent and ac¦complished <HI>Persons</HI> to form you aright in mind and in manners, under the blessing of God upon their great pains which they daily take with you; your Minds to useful <HI>Know¦ledge,</HI> for that the Soul be without knowledge is not good; and your manners to a regular practice of <HI>Virtue</HI> and piety.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002256_0046_0FDADD93D3B8A138"/>
NOW <HI>Children,</HI> you ought to be very <HI>sensi∣ble</HI> of the great benefit you have by, and be very <HI>thankful</HI> to GOD and Man for the ear∣ly Means of Instruction which you enjoy: And you must be told that your Advantage and <HI>Happiness</HI> in this respect is peculiar a∣mong the <HI>English Provinces;</HI> for your wise and pious <HI>Ancestors</HI> made it their first and chief care to have <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Learning</HI> flourish among their <HI>Posterity;</HI> to which end as they put themselves under the watch of learned and holy <HI>Pastors,</HI> so they provided <HI>Schools</HI> (Inferior and Superior) for their Chil∣dren; and agreeably to their pious hope and endeavour <HI>Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Literature</HI> has been the distinguishing honour of the Children of <HI>New England</HI> unto this day.</P>
<P>THIS day therefore we call upon you, <HI>our Children, and Young People,</HI> as you would be now the Children of GOD, and hereafter <HI>Men of GOD</HI> like your <HI>Fathers</HI> who are now in Glory, religiously and diligently to improve the Means of Education which you are bless'd with. <HI>God</HI> expects it of you, your <HI>Parents</HI> command it, your <HI>Ministers</HI> charge you; and you are <HI>wicked</HI> before God if you are <HI>idle</HI> and negligent at School. <HI>Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get Wisdom, and with all thy getting get Understanding: Exalt her and she shall promote thee, she shall bring thee to honour if thou doest embrace her: she shall give to thine head an Ornament of Grace, a Crown of Glory shall she deliver to thee.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="002256_0047_0FDADD99C9CCDD88"/>
BUT if you are <HI>idle at School</HI> you deceive your Parents, you are <HI>base</HI> and <HI>ungrateful</HI> to them, you do in effect <HI>ly</HI> to 'em from day to day; You say, <HI>Sir I go</HI> to learn, but <HI>do not<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> you <HI>disobey</HI> 'em and <HI>rebel</HI> against them; nay you in effect <HI>rob</HI> 'em and <HI>steal</HI> from 'em, de∣fraud and <HI>cheat</HI> 'em: in all this <HI>wickedness</HI> you daily live; and is it not the way to be <HI>cursed children?</HI></P>
<P>I will only add, That you must love and esteem, honour and fear, obey and submit to your <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Mistresses</HI> at School, in like manner as you would to your Father and Mo∣ther at home. It has been sometimes made a Question, to which one <HI>owes</HI> most? to his <HI>Father</HI> for his <HI>Being,</HI> or to his <HI>Tutor</HI> for his Institution? But there is no question to be made of this Truth, — that the like <HI>Piety</HI> which a Child ought to show to the <HI>One</HI> at home, he ought to the <HI>other</HI> at School; and with a pious Reverence next to that with which thou dost remember thy Parents, re¦member always thy wise and learned and faithful Tutors. The great <HI>Apostle</HI> gratefully speaks of his being <HI>brought up at the feet of Gamaliel;</HI> from which our Children should learn to sit with <HI>humility</HI> at the feet of them that instruct 'em, and to mention their Name<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with <HI>honour</HI> as long as they live. God com¦mands your pious Veneration toward them whom He has <HI>adorn'd,</HI> endow'd qualify'd and call'd to teach you. And let all that are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> honoured to be <HI>Teachers</HI> of Children and
<PB N="25" REF="002256_0047_0FDADD99C9CCDD88"/>Youth, use their Authority over them, and their Interest in them, to form them (by the Grace of GOD) unto <HI>Early Piety</HI> and religion.</P>
<P>BUT then you have your <HI>School-Mates,</HI> and Piety obliges you not to hinder them in learning or tempt them to play and idleness, but rather to put them on minding their Book, or if they need it to help them in learning it, or if they be diligent to be admonished by their Example, or if they can inform thee to ask of them. And you should be kind, humble, meek, grateful one toward another <HI>as the</HI> dear <HI>Children of God, and walk in</HI> peace and <HI>love.</HI></P>

<P>YOU have had the Duties of <HI>Godliness</HI> and <HI>Righteousness</HI> Explain'd; It remains, that we consider the duties you stand oblig'd to, re∣specting yourselves. Indeed the Duties we are now speaking of, come under the general head of Justice or Righteousness, and are to be referr'd to the Second Table of the Law. Thus for Example, The Seventh Command∣ment requireth the Preservation of our own as well as our neighbours Chastity. For the Illustration of the Doctrine, I shall consider several things implied in being Sober-minded.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>YOUNG Persons must take care that their minds be under the governing influence of right Principles.</HI></P>
<P>WE have observed that the word signifieth to be of a right mind. Thus <HI>Mark</HI> 5.15. He that had been possessed, is said to be in his right mind. Now if we would have a sound mind in a spiritual sense, we must seek to get our minds enlightened with the Saving knowledge of the truths of God's Word, and make use of the Excellent Rules there laid down, for the right government of our lives. The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> Exhorts believ∣ers, 1 Pet. 1.13. <HI>Gird up the loins of your mind, be sober—.</HI> Now this Girdle is

This Girdle is not only for ornament, but also for strength to the fa∣culties of the Soul, that they may not be loosed in an hour of temptation. And there∣fore unless Young Men wear this Girdle, they will be of dissolute lives and manner. The Understanding is the leading faculty and therefore if that be blind, there must be disorder and confusion in the whole ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Agreeably it is said of the Gentiles, that <HI>they walk in the vanity of their mind, having the understanding darkned, being alienated from the life of God, thro' the ignorance that is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them—,</HI> Eph. 4.17, 18. And thus, Rom. 1.2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Their foolish heart was darkned</HI>— And then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> follows, ver. 24. <HI>Wherefore God also gave the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> up to uncleanness—.</HI> And it is very observa∣ble of Young Persons, that their ignorance their want of right judgment, prudence and discretion, are often the causes of great irre∣gularities in their conduct and behaviour. The Youth who yielded to the enticement of the Adultress, is call'd, <HI>A young man v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of understanding,</HI> Prov. 7.7. If you wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> then discharge your Duty towards your selves you must obey that Word, Prov. 7.4. <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unto wisdom, thou art my sister; and call under∣standing thy kinswoman.</HI> You must ask of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that Wisdom which is from above, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣sure up the Word of God in your hearts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the due regulation of your Thoughts, Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> and Actions.

You should hold fast the form of sound words which you have heard, in faith &amp; love which is in Christ Jesus. The Catechism you generally learn in your Childhood, is an excellent Body of Divinity, and well worthy the study of your riper Years. A very pro∣fitable exercise it might be for our Young People to get some good Exposition on the Catechism, and study it with diligence and earnest Prayer to God, to lead them into all Truth, comparing the Doctrines therein laid down, with the texts of Scripture brought to confirm them. <HI>To the Law and to the Testi∣mony!</HI> Unless our Young People be well established in the Doctrines of the Gospel, and under the government of the sacred truths there deliver'd; there will be the greatest danger of their slighting, and then betraying that cause of God for which our Fore-Fathers came into this Land when it was an howling Wilderness.</P>

II. <HI>YOUNG Persons must take heed that they be Wary, cautious and deliberate.</HI></P>
<P>YOUNG Men are full of heat, and there∣fore prone to be too quick and sudden in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> motions; rash and heady in their resolve. They are apt to determine upon things great Consequence before they have we weighed them. Now this precipitancy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> often-times the cause of great blunders <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their Conduct, and in many instances th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> have reason to repent at leisure. And there∣fore if Young Men would be sober-minded they must look about them, be willing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> take advice of such as are of riper years <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> greater experience; and not abound in the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> own sense. And above all you should lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> up to God in Prayer to guide you by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> counsel, and commit your ways unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Crying to him, as Jer. 3.4.—<HI>My father, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> art the guide of my youth.</HI> With the we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> advised there is Wisdom. Such will wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but if you are rash, inadvertent, and lean <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> your own understanding, you will exalt foll<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>YOUNG Persons must be Humble, and ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> heed they do not think of themselves more high<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> then they ought.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is implied in Sober-mindedness Rom. 12.3.—<HI>I say, thro' the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of himself more highly then he ought to thin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but to think soberly—.</HI> It is the same wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="7" REF="002256_0056_0FDADD9E6E0E0A00"/>which is used in our text. Young People must then be <HI>Humble.</HI> You should Earnestly seek after such a frame of spirit as the Psal∣mist had, Psal. 131.1. <HI>Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do I exer∣cise my self in great matters, or in things too high for me.</HI> You must humble your selves, and become as little children, mean, and lit∣tle in your own eyes; or you cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Pride is a lust of the mind, and is a Sin which easily besets Young Persons. Isai. 3.5. <HI>The child shall be¦have himself proudly against the ancient.</HI> They are oftentimes ignorant of themselves, Novices, and so prone to be lifted up with pride, and in danger of falling into the Condemnation of the Devil. If Young Persons have wit and parts, beauty, riches, fire apparell and the like how apt are they to swell with pride! <HI>There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and their eye-lids are lifted up,</HI> Prov. 30.13. Many declare this Sin in their looks, gestures, and carriages. Thus the Daughters of Zion were haughty, and walked with stretched forth necks. Their Pride was also declar'd in the excess of their Apparel; for which reason, God threatned to take away the bravery of their Ornaments. <HI>Isai.</HI> 3.16,—18. Young People are apt to be conceited, and to magnify themselves; to be desirous of vain glory, and ambitious of more honour and respect than they deserve. Let them there∣fore be deeply humbled for their Pride, and
<PB N="8" REF="002256_0057_0FDADD9FD9F51888"/>by the Grace of God cast down their proud imaginations, and every thing that exalteth it self against God. Obey that Command, 1 Pet. 5.5. <HI>Ye younger, submit your selves unt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the elder: yea, all of you be subject one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> another, and be cloathed with Humility—.</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Grace becometh you. This Garment well <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and suits you; for Sin hath made you nake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to your shame. It is pleasing to God; b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the contrary is abominable in his sight. Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 16.5. <HI>Every one that is proud in heart, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abomination to the Lord—.</HI> God resisteth th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> proud, and giveth Grace to the humbl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Humble your selves then, that God may ex¦alt you. Beware of Pride, lest God be pro∣voked to leave you to some Sin which shall be a blot and stain that shall cleave to you and not be wiped away. O remember that word, Prov. 16.18. <HI>Pride goeth before destruction and an haughty spirit before a fall.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>YOUNG Persons must look to it that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be of a Meek and Quiet Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>MEEKNESS is a Grace of the Holy Spirit whereby we regulate our Anger, according to the rules of God's Word. Now the con∣trary Sin, rash and immoderate Anger, of<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> prevails in Young People, who have a natur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Fervour of spirit in conjunction with a vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ous disposition to this Sin. How soon do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> observe wrathful passions working in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Children! Now this is a great Sin, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to other Sins.

<PB N="9" REF="002256_0057_0FDADD9FD9F51888"/>names; Sins highly provoking to God, and such as all, and particularly our Young People, shou'd carefully avoid, and therefore shun this temptation to them. To be angry with our brother without a cause or in an undue mea∣sure is a Breach of the Sixth Commandment, and it leads to more hainous Violations of it. How often do Men smite their neighbour with the fist of wickedness, when in the heat of pas∣sion! Yea, this Sin hath produced bloody ef∣fects, and proceeded to Murder. A dreadful example we have to our purpose in the slaugh∣ter of the <HI>Shechemites</HI> by <HI>Simeon</HI> and <HI>Levi,</HI> of which <HI>Jacob</HI> speaks, Gen. 49.6, 7. <HI>O my soul, come not thou in their secret; unto their assem∣bly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger they slew a man—Cursed be their anger for it was fierce; and there wrath for it was cruel—.</HI> Let us all then, and particularly our Young People, obey that Command; Col. 3.12, 13. <HI>Put on therefore — meekness, long-suffering. Forbearing one another—.</HI> O Young Men! Be gentle, and easy to be en∣treated; not wrathful and revengeful. A∣void this great Sin, and all the occasions of it, as <HI>grievous words, which stir up anger,</HI> Prov. 15.1. It is true, we may be angry and not sin; Eph. 4.26. <HI>Be angry and sin not—.</HI> But then, when we are angry without cause, or in undue measure, when we retain it, and let the Sun go down on our wrath, when we suffer our Anger to degenerate into malice and hatred, we break God's Law and are found
<PB N="10" REF="002256_0058_0FDADDA1579D3250"/>transgressors: We do that which is sinful and displeasing in His sight, as well as hurtful and dishonourable to our selves. Mat. 5.22. <HI>He that is angry with his brother without a cause is in danger of the judgment.</HI> Such do expose themselves to the righteous judgment of God, and also to manifold mischiefs from Men. Prov. 25.28. <HI>He that hath no rule over his own spirit, is like a city that is broken down and with∣out walls.</HI> How naked and expos'd are such! Let our Young People then he deeply hum∣bled for their rash anger and passion; parti∣cularly, if you have at any time been fill'd with rage at your Parents or Masters, for giving you needful Correction.

O take heed that you do not give up your selves to rash Anger and Passion, which is a short madness! Watch over your hearts, and Pray to God to keep them, and to enable you to govern your Passion. A meek and quiet spirit is an excellent spirit indeed. 1 Pet. 3.4. — <HI>The ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God of great price.</HI> O seek this Ornament, and never forget to wear it! Such a Spirit is pleasing to God, lovely in the eyes of Men, and of great be∣nefit to <HI>Societies.</HI> Their well-being doth very much depend upon this, that the several Members put off <HI>Wrath, Anger, Malice;</HI> par∣ticularly, the tranquillity and good Ord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

Where an angry spirit prevails, there will be strife, and then confu∣sion and every evil work.

Sure∣ly it is better to cut off a <HI>right hand,</HI> or pluck out a <HI>right eye,</HI> than to be cast into that Fire which can't be quenched. The time would fail me to mention all the delights and pleasures whereby Young Persons are ensnar'd and ruin'd. I shall mention some of them under following Heads.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>YOUNG Persons must be Temperate.</HI></P>
<P>WE are commanded to <HI>add to knowledge temperance,</HI> 2 Pet. 1.6. I use the word here in a restrained sense, for a due regulation of the Appetite respecting meat and drink. Now this is a considerable branch of <HI>Sobriety,</HI> and a Duty incumbent on all, particularly on Young Men. Be you perswaded then, to hearken to the Counsel given you. Prov. 23.19—21. <HI>Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the way. Be not amongst wine-bibbers; amongst riotous caters of flesh. For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty.</HI> There was a Law of old which threatned death to such wicked Young Men, as persisted in these Sins, notwithstanding the admonitions of these Parents. Deut. 21.18—21. <HI>If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not obey the voice of his father—. Then shall his father and mother lay hold
<PB N="14" REF="002256_0060_0FDADDA462345900"/>on him, bring him out to the elders of his City—. And they shall say unto the elders of his City, this our son is stubborn — he is a glut∣ton, and a drunkard. And all the men of his Ci∣ty shall stone him with stones that he die—.</HI> You see here that the incorrigible Youth who would not be reclaim'd from such Sins, wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be put to death. And know it these sin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of <HI>Gluttony</HI> and <HI>Dunkenness</HI> are not less pro∣voking to God under the <HI>Gospel Dispensatio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> than they were of old under the Legal. No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> such works of darkness are more hainous i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the sight of God, when committed under th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Light of the glorious Gospel. Agreeably, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> have those words, Rom. 13.13. <HI>Let us wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> honestly as in the day; not in rioting and drun∣kenness</HI>—. Take heed then lest at any tim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness.

This Sin strangely besots and infatuate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Men, &amp; makes them vile. Such excesses clou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and enfeeble the mind, &amp; take off the heart fro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> all that is good.

But what is inconceivably more hurtful, it wounds the precious Soul, and provoketh God to with∣draw even the common restraints of His Grace. This Sin quencheth the motions of God's Holy Spirit, Eph. 5.18. <HI>Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the spirit.</HI> And if this be persisted in, it will destroy Body and Soul in Hell. Drunkards are numbred among them that shall not in∣herit the Kingdom of God. 1 Cor. 6.10. <HI>Such must be washed, and sanctified,</HI> and <HI>justi∣fied in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the spirit of our God,</HI> or be cast out of God's Pre∣sence for ever. Let us all then, and parti∣cularly, Young People, be Exhorted to fly these Sins. When you eat and drink, let it be for strength, and not for Drunkenness. Do not frequent Taverns, and indulge your selves in Night-Revels. It is a shame and scandal for Young Men, or any others, to be at Publick Houses enflaming themselves with strong drink, when they should be in their Closets, praying to that God who seeth in
<PB N="16" REF="002256_0061_0FDADDA5CB69D830"/>secret, or attending Family-Duties, or at rest in their Beds. Take heed then, <HI>Have no fellowship with such unfruitful works of dark∣ness; but rather reprove them.</HI> This Sin may seem pleasant now; but know it, <HI>At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an ad∣der. Thy eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall utter perverse things. Yea thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the sea, or as he that lieth on the top of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mast,</HI> Prov. 23.32,—34.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>YOUNG People must be Chaste.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is an eminent branch of <HI>Sobriety.</HI> And it is a great Duty commanded in God's Law. The Seventh Commandment is, <HI>Thou shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not commit Adultery,</HI> Exod. 20.14. It re∣quireth Chastity in body, and mind, in tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> words, and actions; and forbids all filthine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and uncleanness. We are now especially to con∣sider it as it respects Young People, and suc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as are in a single state. It must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said to Young People, as well as others, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in 1 Thes. 4.3, 4. <HI>This is the will of Go<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> even your sanctification: that every one of yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should know how to possess his vessel in sanctifi¦cation and honour.</HI> Take heed to your selves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> avoid all impurity, and all means a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> provocations thereunto.

<PB N="17" REF="002256_0061_0FDADDA5CB69D830"/>the inward lustings of the heart subdued and mortifyed. That these are a breach of the Seventh Commandment we are told, Mat. 5.28. And thus our Saviour also assureth us, that <HI>out of the heart proceed evil tho'ts, murders; adulteries, fornications;—These are the things which defile a man,</HI> Mat. 15.19, 20. And therefore there must be great care to abstain from lustful thoughts, and impure imagina∣tions. We must take heed we do not enter∣tain, and defile our minds with filthy specu∣lations, and burn with unclean desires. But on the contrary, we must mortify evil con∣cupiscence, lest we be led aside of our own lust and enticed. You must also take care that you do not yield any of the parts of your Bodies as instruments to uncleanness. The Countenance and outward Gestures are the index of the Mind, and therefore you must take care that these be grave and modest, that you be not light and wanton in your looks and gestures. We read of a wicked person that <HI>winketh with his eyes, speaketh with his feet, and teacheth with his fingers,</HI> Prov. 6.13. The eye is a window at which much Sin is let into the Soul, and therefore if you would preserve your Chastity, you must <HI>make a Co∣venant with your eyes,</HI> as Job did, <HI>Job</HI> 31.1. and take heed you be not as they who have <HI>eyes full of Adultery.</HI> Again, You must look to God to keep the door of your lips, and refrain from that evil Communication which corrupts good manners. Eph. 4.29. <HI>Let no
<PB N="18" REF="002256_0062_0FDADDA7E15D5220"/>corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth.</HI> Col. 4.6. <HI>Let your speech be always with grace, season∣ed with salt.</HI> Let your tongues be employ'd in singing the Praises of God, and not in singing filthy Songs. O do not turn your Glory into shame, by employing the powers of Speech to such vile purposes! And the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> take heed you do not listen to the corrupt com∣munications of others. Again, Take heed and <HI>beware of all wanton dalliances and impu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> touches.</HI> To be sure then you must take heed and beware of all <HI>gross Acts of filthiness</HI> whether alone, or with others. Be exhorte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to fly that heinous Sin of <HI>Onan;</HI> for which the Lord slew him, <HI>Gen.</HI> 38.9, 10.

This Sin committed between <HI>Single Persons,</HI> is a great breach of God's Law, and not to be accounted a light matter. Yea for Persons that contract an intimate acquaintance with a purpose of Marriage, to come together be∣fore it be consummated; is not to be ac∣counted a small Sin: No! It is a dishonour to God, and scandal to Religion, and as such to be carefully avoided by all, and particu∣larly by our Young People. A more hainous Transgression of the Seventh Commandment it is for Persons to commit this Sin where <HI>one or both are in a Married state:</HI> An hor∣rid Violation this is of the Marriage Cove∣nant, which God calls <HI>His Covenant,</HI> and ac∣cordingly was of old punished with Death. Lev. 20.10. <HI>And the man that committeth A∣dultery with anothers man's wife, even he that committeth Adultery with his neighbours wife,

<P>YOU must Avoid Prodigality and Profuse∣ness, and take heed you be not as the <HI>Prodi∣gal Son, who wasted his substance with riotous <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ving,</HI> Luk. 15.13. If your Parents have left you an Estate; Or you have other ways <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otten it; you must consider this is a Talent which God hath lent you, and which he re∣quireth you to employ in His Service, and for His Glory. Take heed therefore that you do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot waste it to gratify your Ambition, or sen∣suality. Do not affect to make a greater <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow than your Estate will bear. Do not consume what God hath given you upon your lusts. Particularly, Beware of the <HI>Sin of Gaming</HI> which is a breach of the Eighth Com∣mandment. The money which is lost by Gaming is vilely cast away, and that which is gotten by it, is dishonestly gotten, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust be restor'd, or it may be a Moth to your whole Estate. In a word, see to it that you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o not waste your Estates, or what may be given you by your Parents, in unlawful Recrea∣tions and Pleasures, or by the immoderate use of such as are in themselves innocent &amp; lawful.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS Book is call'd the <HI>Proverbs;</HI> because it is a Divine Collection of <HI>the Proverbs,</HI> i. e. the wise and pithy Sentences <HI>of Solomon the Son of David King of Israel.</HI> The great design in general is to bring the Sons of Men <HI>to know wisdom and in∣struction,
<PB N="2" REF="002256_0067_0FDADDB28DAE9428"/>to perceive the words of understanding,</HI> and also <HI>to receive the instruction of wisdom justice and judgment and equity.</HI> In particular, <HI>To give subtilty to the simple, and to the young man knowledge and discretion.</HI> Thus He tell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us Himself in the 4 first verses.</P>
<P>AS King <HI>Solomon</HI> excelled all the Earth i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wisdom; so He was Renowned also for hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> excellent Sayings. It is said <HI>He spake thre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Thousand Proverbs—And there came of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> people to hear his wisdom, from all the Kings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Earth that had heard of his wisdom,</HI> 1 King. 4.32,—34.</P>
<P>IN these excellent Proverbs He dispens'<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> His Wisdom. Like <HI>Moses,</HI> His <HI>Doctrine</HI> drop∣ped <HI>as the Rain</HI> on all about Him: His <HI>Speed</HI> distilled <HI>as the Dew; as the small Rain upon the tender Herb, and as the Showers upon the Grass,</HI> Deut. 32.2. In this respect tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Prophecy of his Father <HI>David</HI> was accom∣plished in Him, Psal. 72.6. <HI>He shall com<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> down like Rain on the mown Grass, and as th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> showers that water the Earth.</HI> And on this account in seems to be that when the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> had seen His Wisdom, and the sit∣ting of His Servants, and the attendance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> His Ministers; she cry'd out to the King in admiration, 2 Chron. 9.3,—7. <HI>It was a tru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> report which I had heard in mine own Land of thy sayings and of thy wisdom: Howbeit I be∣lieved not their words, until I came, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> eyes had seen it; and behold, the one half of the greatness of thy wisdom was not told me
<PB N="3" REF="002256_0067_0FDADDB28DAE9428"/>For thou exceedest the fame that I heard: Hap∣py are thy Men, and happy are these thy Ser∣vants, which stand continually before thee and hear thy wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>HAPPY were they that continually stood before Him and heard these wise and excel∣lent Proverbs proceed from His Mouth! Happy are we that have them copied out and set before us; that we may continual∣ly read and study them. But most happy those that carefully Observe and Follow them. By receiving these instructions of Wisdom; we shall become Wise like Him that gave them: They will give even sub∣tilty to those that are simple, and to the Young Man Knowledge and Discretion.</P>
<P>AND indeed in the midst of all His Speeches, we may plainly observe, that this most Wise and Foreseeing King had a singular view to the Rising Generation. He clearly saw of what Importance it was to Instruct the Youth in the Principles of Wisdom, and that these were the likeliest and the fittest to learn them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Grown up</HI> in Years had spent a deal of Time: their season of Service would soon be over, and they were so throughly fix'd and riveted in their several Ways and Prin∣ciples, that they were not so like to learn or receive Instruction. The <HI>Good</HI> had receiv'd it and were wise already; and 10 had less the need to be Taught than others: He need not take abundance of pains with these, for
<PB N="4" REF="002256_0068_0FDADDB408E659D0"/>they would hear and increase in l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣ing, and of their own accord aspire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> higher degrees of Wisdom and Knowledge. The <HI>Bad</HI> had receiv'd such ill and deep Im∣pressions from their long continuance in their sinful courses, that there were little hopes of their hearkning to Him. They <HI>are estranged from the womb,</HI> they have gone astray ever since they were born—, and <HI>they are like the deaf adder, that stops her ears, which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they never so wisely,</HI> Psal. 58.3,—5.</P>
<P>THE Tender <HI>Youth</HI> were the most fit and apt to Learn, and the easiest and likeliest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> receive Instruction: They were the spring∣ing Supports of the Rising Age: and if these could be imbued with Wisdom; How Wise and Happy would be the next Genera∣tion? King <HI>Solomon</HI> sees it; and therefore He continually fixes His Eye upon them: H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shows a singular regard and view to them in His Wise Speeches and Immortal Writings.</P>
<P>IT seems indeed as if the Books of the <HI>Proverbs</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiastes,</HI> were written chiefly for the Instruction of Youth. For the Book of the <HI>Proverbs</HI> begins thus — <HI>My So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hear the instruction of thy Father,</HI> &amp;c. Prov. 1.8. Throughout the whole Book He is conti∣nually recurring to this peculiar expression. <HI>My Son, My Son;</HI> and a Learned Man observes that He repeats this Title <HI>Twenty Three</HI> times, to show, that the main E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> his Writing was the Instruction of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="5" REF="002256_0068_0FDADDB408E659D0"/>Ones. And the Book of the <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI> ends with such words as these— <HI>And further, By these my Son be admonished: of making many Books there is no end, and much study is a wea∣riness of the flesh: Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter; Fear God and keep His Commandments, For this is the whole Duty of Man, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Great and Renowned King conde∣scends to be a Preacher to Children. He speaks to every Child about Him, when He says, <HI>My Son:</HI> and He calls upon them by this endearing Term in our Text; to express His tender Affection, and engage them to Him.</P>
<P>BUT we must here remember, that <HI>Solomon</HI> was a Divinely Inspired Preacher: and He does not speak so much in His own Name, as in the Name of <HI>God</HI> that imploy'd and mov'd Him. It is <HI>in the Name of God,</HI> and <HI>to God Himself</HI> that He requests the Youth to give his Heart. The Wise Man does not speak these Words in His own behalf; but in the behalf of God, whose Messenger he was. And indeed, if we judge aright <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they are the Words of God Himself by this Inspired Preacher. Like as the <HI>Apostle▪</HI> tell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> us, that He and other Ministers were Em∣bassadors imploy'd by Christ and that by them even God and Christ intreated Men to be Re∣conciled to God, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.20. It is God our Heaven∣ly Father who does here most earnestly desire this Gift from Youth and Children to be
<PB N="6" REF="002256_0069_0FDADDB583C6C818"/>Presented to Him; and to whom it is most especially and principally due.</P>
<P>IN the Name of God I require you there∣fore now to yield Obedience to this Great and Important Doctrine.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> THAT Youth and Children must give up their Hearts to God in their Early Days.</HEAD>
<P>AS this Great and Royal Preacher did: so I now apply my self to the Youth and Chil∣dren round about me: I tho' most unworthy, speak by the same Authority: I am the Minister of God unto you: I am come with the same design: I deliver you the same Message: It is the Word and Voice of God Himself: And in His Name I plainly tell you, yea and God tells you by me, that you must now give up your Hearts to God in your Youthful Age.</P>
<P>BUT for <HI>Illustration</HI> I shall endeavour these Two Things,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. TO show you what it is to <HI>Give up your Hearts</HI> to God; And</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. WHAT are those Great and Solemn <HI>Obligations</HI> you are under to it.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THE <HI>First</HI> of these I shall be very Brief upon: Because the <HI>Nature</HI> of Early Piety, both as it relates to God, our Neighbour and
<PB N="7" REF="002256_0069_0FDADDB583C6C818"/>Our-selves has already been Explain'd and set before you. The <HI>Latter</HI> I shall more Largely Treat of; it being my peculiar Pro∣vince, to set before the Children of our People, the Great and Solemn <HI>Obligations</HI> they are under to be Religious in their Youth∣ful Age.</P>
<P>First. <HI>WHAT is it to give up your Hearts to God.</HI></P>
<P>NOW to give up your Hearts to God, is to give up yourselves to God intirely and for ever thro' Christ, and with all your Hearts.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is to give up</HI> your selves Intirely <HI>to God.</HI></P>
<P>YOU must give up <HI>your selves</HI> and all you have <HI>intirely</HI> to Him in your Early Days. You must give up your <HI>Bodies</HI> and all its Parts &amp; Members, and especially the Tongue to God. You must give up all your Senses to Him: your Strength and Vigour, and your Health and Beauty. You must likewise give up your <HI>Spirit,</HI> Temper, and all your vari∣ous Appetites and Passions to Him. And to be sure you must also give up your most Precious <HI>Souls,</HI> with all their Faculties, Abilities and Powers to God: Your Imagination, Under∣standing, Reason, Judgment, Conscience Affections, Will and Memory; And in Fine, you must give up all your Knowledge, Wit and Ingenuity; and all the Treasures and Endowments of your Minds: You must in∣tirely give them all to God without the least Reserve.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002256_0070_0FDADDBC036D6D18"/>
AND <HI>For what Ends and Purposes</HI> must you give them to Him?</P>
<P>I answer, you must give them all to God, to be Sanctify'd, Possess'd and Govern'd by Him. You must give them up to be His own Inheritance and Propriety. You must give them up, to live and move and act for God and to be improved intirely for His Intere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Service. You must give up your selve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to seek and know Him, and to adore and serve Him. You must intirely give up you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> selves to God, to be Disposed of as He see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Good, to study to know His Mind and Will and to do and suffer what ever He require of you. You must give up your selves, <HI>to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> all ungodliness and worldly lusts,</HI> and to <HI>live soberly, righteously &amp; godly in this present world</HI> Tit. 2.12. You must give up your selves; that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Eating, Drinking, or whatever else you do, you may do it to the Glory of God, I <HI>Cor.</HI> 10. 31. And Finally, you must give up your selves to God; To have Communion with Him and Enjoy Him: To be fill'd with all Hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fulness, and to be made compleatly like Him.</P>
<P>AND in giving up <HI>your selves</HI> to God you must also give up <HI>all you have.</HI> You must give up your very Lives and all your Power of Speaking, Tho't and Action. You must devote your Studies, Learning, Interest, Ho∣nour and Repute to God; your Recreations Pleasures, Affairs and Time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and to by sure whatever you esteem and value, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> must give up to God. In short, you must
<PB N="9" REF="002256_0070_0FDADDBC036D6D18"/>give Him all you are possessed of, can Suffer, Do, Enjoy or Have: You must keep nothing from Him: you must intirely Resign and Devote them to Him: and you must give them up, to be subordinated and im∣proved for His own Glory, and to be Disposed of according to His Sovereign Pleasure.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>YOU must therefore give up your selves to God</HI> for ever.</P>
<P>GOD will have you for His own for∣ever; or not at all. He would have you be in an Eternal Subjection to Him. He would have you be the Eternal active Instru∣ments of His Glory and Honour. God would have you yield Eternal Adoration to Him. He would have you to be the Eternal Objects of His Delight and Love: and He would have you to be forever Happy in the Service and Injoyment of Him.</P>
<P>YOU must therefore give up your selves and all you have to God, <HI>for ever.</HI> You must make such an absolute Devotion of yourselves to God; as never to have the least pretence or right, to free your selves again. You must give up yourselves intirely to God in an E∣verlasting Covenant, never to be broken. And this <HI>O Children</HI> you must do in your Early Days.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>YOU must give up your selves to God</HI> in Christ.</P>
<P>CHILDREN! out of Christ God wont accept you. God has indeed an unalienable Right and Propriety in you: you must needs be His own forever: and He will Eternally use you for His Glory. But out of Christ
<PB N="10" REF="002256_0071_0FDAC978D8985360"/>He'l surely make you the miserable Instru∣ments of the dreadful Glory of His Power and Justice; and not the happy Instruments of the Glory of His Grace and Mercy. You are both by Life and Nature most abomina∣ble and guilty Sinners; and out of Christ God utterly abhors you and is angry with you; He can't accept, He can't Forgive you, He cannot be Reconciled to you. But in Christ His Son, our Mediator, and in Christ alone, God is Reconcileable to such sinful Children, and He is ready to Forgive you and Receive you. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.18, 19.</P>
<P>YOU must therefore give your selves to God in Christ; or He'l cast you off. You must in the first place go to Christ the Son of God and your Mediator. You must pre∣sent and give your selves to Christ; that He may give you unto God. You must plead with Christ to Accept and take you for His own: and you must not doubt but He'l receive you; since He was so much dis∣pleas'd with those that hinder'd Children from coming to Him, and said let them come, <HI>for of such is the Kingdom of God,</HI> Mar. 10.13,—16.</P>
<P>CHILDREN, you must not therefore Doubt but Christ will Accept and Bless you upon your coming and giving up yourselves unto Him. And then in Christ, you may with an holy Confidence give up your selves to God. Christ will become your Mediator; and in Blessing you, He'l take away the
<PB N="11" REF="002256_0071_0FDAC978D8985360"/>guilt and curse of Sin, He'l purge you from it, and He'l make you thro' His Blood a most acceptable offering unto God. Christ will readily introduce you to Him: He'l be pleas'd to make such a Present unto God, and God Himself will be pleased to Receive it.</P>
<P N="4">4. AND Lastly, <HI>YOU must thus give your selves to God</HI> with all your Hearts.</P>
<P>THIS Giving up yourselves to God must not be a meer formal action; but it must be an hearty Offering and Devoting of yourselves to God. It must be Done in the Heart, and from thence it must Proceed; or God will not Regard you. Your Hearts must be given up to God: Or you are not intire or sincere in your Devotion to Him. And if you give up yourselves to God, without your Hearts approving and concurring; your Offering is but the Sacrifice of Hypocrites, which is an abomination to Him.</P>
<P>NO! your <HI>Hearts</HI> are the Principal and most Peculiar Things which God Regards; and they indeed include and contain all o∣thers. The Preacher therefore does not say the <HI>Hand</HI> or <HI>Head,</HI> but <HI>Heart;</HI> Because by the Possession of the Heart God has all the mem∣bers of the Soul and Body devoted to Him; and without the Heart God values not the Rest. To give to God an Outward show of Piety, is but a mocking of Him, unless your Hearts go with it. Give your Hearts, and you give Him all: Give Him not your Hearts,
<PB N="12" REF="002256_0072_0FDADDC0CD0A0728"/>and you really give Him nothing, whatever else you seem to give Him.</P>
<P>YOU must be sincere and hearty therefore in your giving up yourselves; or you Do not Truly give yourselves to God. You only make an Outward show: But God Beholds your secret Enmity and Aversion to Him. You must not only give up yourselves intirely and forever to Him; But you must also do it without Reluctance. You must do it freely, and with full consent of Soul. In Fine, you must set your Heart and highest Love on God: And from your highest Esteem of God and your earnest Desire to Injoy and Serve Him you must Give your selves unto Him.</P>
<P>AND thus have I briefly shown you what it is to <HI>give up your Hearts to God:</HI> And this you must take care to do in your Youth∣ful Age. This is your first and great and most incumbent Duty. You must not allow yourselves to Live an Hour, no not a Moment till you have given yourselves to God. As soon as you were capable of Knowing Him you should have given yourselves to Him And if you have not done it yet; you must do it now, and without the least Delay.</P>
<P>AND in order to convince you of this most incumbent Duty, we now Proceed more large∣ly to Consider.</P>
<P>Secondly. <HI>WHAT are those</HI> Great &amp; Solemn OBLIGATIONS <HI>you are under thus to give your selves to God in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002256_0072_0FDADDC0CD0A0728"/>
IT is very likely many of you Think, that this is a matter of very great Indifference. Multitudes among you seem to think so, by your lewd ungodly Lives, and by your light and vain Behaviour in the House of God. You seem to think as if you were not under any <HI>Obligations</HI> to be Religious in your Youthful Age. Or at least you think, your <HI>Obligations</HI> are but trifling things, and of little Force and Moment. Many of you seem to be intirely careless whether you give your Hearts to God or no. You exceedingly neglect Him, and you rather set your selves against Him: You give up your Hearts to Earthly Things and Pleasures, and to Youth∣ful Lusts and Vanities, and not to God. Alas, you little think what Great and Solemn <HI>Ob∣ligations</HI> are lying on you to Devote your Hearts to God in your Early Days!</P>
<P>YOUR <HI>Obligations</HI> are the most <HI>Great and Solemn</HI> that can be Tho't of: And if you be'nt Obliged to give your selves to God, you are obliged to nothing. And your <HI>Ob∣ligations</HI> are so <HI>exceeding numerous,</HI> that I cannot mention nor conceive them all: nor can I now express a thousandth part of those I might conceive: For I can Think of Nothing, but it is an <HI>Obligation</HI> on you to be Religious.</P>
<P>EVERY <HI>Attribute</HI> of God is an Obligation on you to give your selves unto Him. Every <HI>Work</HI> of God you see, presents an Obligati∣on to you. Every <HI>Mercy</HI> you receive, and every <HI>Affliction</HI> which you meet with; yea
<PB N="14" REF="002256_0073_0FDADDBF42FDCEE0"/>every Good and every Evil which you hear of in the World. Every Thing contained in the <HI>Word</HI> of God; and every Thing you <HI>Have,</HI> or are able to Do for God is an <HI>Obli∣gation</HI> on you to give your selves unto Him.</P>
<P>BUT I must confine my self to a Few.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THERE is</HI> a GOD, <HI>a most</HI> Glorious and Sovereign God; <HI>and therefore you are obliged to give your Hearts unto Him in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Argument and Obligation rises from the Being, Nature and Perfections of God. And I begin with this, because it is the First Foundation of all Religion. Now I need not g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> about to prove that there is a God. I believe you are sensible, that this Glorious Sun, &amp; Moon and Stars, &amp; even You yourselves could not be made without Him. I shall only now con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ide<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> briefly <HI>who and what He is;</HI> and you will clearly see yourselves obliged to give your Hearts unto Him in your Early Days.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>HE is</HI> most Glorious and Perfect in Him∣self: <HI>and therefore you are Obliged to give your Hearts unto Him in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P>YOU have learnt already that there is b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> One only True and Living God: and that He is a Spirit of Himself, and for Himself <HI>Of Himself;</HI> i. e. He is the first Cause, He is Self-existent, or He Existeth Live and Acteth of Himself alone, and from no other: and <HI>For Himself;</HI> i. e. He is the highest End, He Lives and Acteth Supream∣ly
<PB N="15" REF="002256_0073_0FDADDBF42FDCEE0"/>for Himself alone, and in subordination to Himself, for other Things.</P>
<P>GOD is absolutely Perfect: a most Pure Spi∣rit; without Body, Parts or Passions, and Free from all Composition. And you have also Learnt; that He is Infinite, Eternal and Unchangeable in His Being, Wisdom, Power, Holiness, Justice, Goodness and Truth. God is without Beginning, and He can never have an End. He is Immense and Omnipre∣sent. He is always present in every Place; and He always views every Thing Present, Future, Past and Possible. God is Omniscient also, i. e. He always sees and knows whatever has been, is, and will come to Pass. Yea, God intirely sees whatever might have been, and whatever can be. He is an All-wise and All-mighty Being. He is immutably the same from Everlasting to Everlasting. He is Inde∣pendent, Supream and Sovereign, Self-suffici∣ent, All-sufficient, and in Himself alone is Infinitely happy.</P>
<P>SUCH a Glorious Being is surely most worthy of our highest Love and Admiration. If any Thing should be Lov'd or Admir'd by you for its Excellency or Perfections; surely God must be so. Every Divine Per∣fection is most worthy of your highest Love, Delight and Wonder; and every Divine Perfection is a great and indispensible Obliga∣tion on you to give your hearts to God. I might easily show how they are, if I had Time to run into particulars. But in general,
<PB N="16" REF="002256_0074_0FDADDC24CA021C8"/>How highly should you reverence and fear Him? How profoundly should you adore and worship Him? How earnest should you be to know Him &amp; to be acquainted with Him? How desirous should you be of the Favour, Love and Friendship of so Great a Being? How ready should you be to serve Him? and how heartily should you resign your selves unto Him?</P>
<P>OH Vain Youth and Children, How inex∣cusable is it that you should refuse your Hearts to this most Glorious and Perfect Be∣ing, and give them up to perishing and em<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Things and Pleasures!</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD is the</HI> Infinite and Sovereign Foun∣tain <HI>of Being, Life and Goodness: and therefore you are obliged to give your Hearts unto Him in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P>GOD alone is infinite in all Perfections: He has an infinite source of Goodness in Him. He is the only Living and Self-Existent Being: and therefore He is the Infinite and Sovereign Fountain of Being, Life and Goodness unto others. And as God is Infinite in Life and Goodness; so He is Infinitely, Bountiful and Liberal. He is an Eternal Fountain full and overflowing, and that can never be exhausted or diminished. As God can make you to Live for ever; so He is freely communicative of Eternal Life unto you. He is infinitely exuberant in Goodness and Happiness: and He is more full and abounding in them to you
<PB N="17" REF="002256_0074_0FDADDC24CA021C8"/>than the <HI>Sun</HI> itself in warmth or Light unto the World.</P>
<P>HOW much are you then obliged to give your hearts to Him, who is the only Infinite and Sovereign Fountain of Life and Goodness. They all depend upon his Sovereign Will and Pleasure, and from him they must proceed. To be sure you all desire to live for ever and be happy: and how inconsistent is it to refuse your hearts to Him from whom alone they flow? But this brings us to the Second Head. viz.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>GOD has</HI> made All Things <HI>for His own</HI> Glory <HI>and He has made</HI> You <HI>to</HI> Glorify and Enjoy Him for ever: <HI>and therefore you are Obliged to give your Hearts to God in your Ear∣ly Days.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Argument and Obligation rises from your Creation and the Ends thereof. And surely this is the most inviolable Obligation on you to give your selves to God; from whom you have intirely received your very Life and Being, and that you may thereby answer the Ends of them.</P>
<P>BUT here are these <HI>two</HI> Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD has</HI> made you and all other Things: <HI>and therefore you are Obliged to give your Hearts to God in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P>WE observ'd before that God is the Sove∣reign Fountain of Life and Being: And now, that He is the actual and universal Creator. Before He made the World, it intirely de∣pended
<PB N="18" REF="002256_0075_0FDADDC3C5615D78"/>on His Sovereign Will and Pleasure whi∣ther or no to bring it into Being. But first He will'd it and spake the Word; and then the whole Creation in a moment sprang from nothing. He brought this lower World in∣to a beautiful Order, and made every Kind of Creature in it in Six Days time. God is the Creator and Former of all things.</P>
<P>AND God having therefore made all Things in the World, He has an absolute Right &amp; Propri∣ety in them. They are the Things of God; And therefore 'tis Just and Right they should be Improved for Him. Youth and Children, you are therefore Gods by Right of Creation: And so are all other Things in the World. Surely then, you are indispensably oblig'd to Give yourselves and all you have to God, whose Due you are. You must be devoted to God, you must Live to God, and you must improve every Thing for God; or you profanely rob Him of his Right and Due.</P>
<P>BUT then, as the Crown of all his Works in this World below, He made and formed Man. He formed a most beauteous Body of the Dust of the Earth, and He breathed into it a Soul, a Spirit Immortal. In every suc∣ceessive Age, as the Children of Men have Dy'd, God has wonderfully made and raised up others. How devoutly does the Psalmist admire His Creator for so Glorious a Work, in <HI>Psal.</HI> 139.14 — 18.</P>
<P>YEA 'tis now, but a little while, that you came out of the Creating Hands of God.
<PB N="19" REF="002256_0075_0FDADDC3C5615D78"/>Youth and Children! the very <HI>Name</HI> you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>are Reminds you of your late Creation. We call you <HI>Young</HI> —which is as much as to say, you are but newly made, you are but newly come out of the Hands of God. The <HI>Preacher</HI> therefore mentions this as a peculiar Obliga∣tion on you to Remember God in your Early Days, Eccl. 12.1. <HI>Remember now your Creator in the Days of your Youth.</HI> It is as if he should say—Your very <HI>Youth</HI> should put you in mind of God: He has but just now bro't you out of nothing into a wonderful Being: and this wonderful Work which God has so lately accomplished for you, should lead you to Him.</P>
<P>CHILDREN! will you refuse your Hearts to Him that made you? and almost as soon as ever you are come out of his Hands? — O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ase Ingratitude!</P>
<P>YEA in some respects you are even <HI>Now</HI> in the <HI>Forming</HI> Hands of God. God has not brought you yet to your full maturity either of Soul or Body. He is now a Build∣ing up your <HI>Bodies</HI> every Day: and in a few Years Time you expect He'l raise you to your Perfection of Strength and to your Hight of Stature. God is also gradually increasing the Powers of your <HI>Minds:</HI> and you hope it won't be long before He'l bring you to your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trength of Reason and Understanding? You plainly see that God is even <HI>Now</HI> a <HI>Forming</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou: He is carrying you on to the Perfection of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ife: and will you now deny him your Hearts,
<PB N="20" REF="002256_0076_0FDADDCA6153A590"/>even while he's a making you? — I wan't Words to describe such a vile Injustice, such an horrid Ingratitude. But</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE</HI> End <HI>of God's making</HI> all Things, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>His</HI> Sovereign Glory; <HI>and of His making</HI> You <HI>is to</HI> Glorify and Enjoy Him for ever: <HI>an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> therefore you should be intirely Devoted to Him</HI></P>
<P>GOD always acts in perfect Wisdom: and before He Creates or Forms, He first propose<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an End that moves Him. His own <HI>Glory</HI> mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> needs be the Sovereign <HI>End</HI> of all His Works The <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Honour</HI> of God were the great Design He pursu'd in every Thing He ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> made: and therefore this is one of the high∣est Obligations on you to give up your selves and all you have to God. Surely the gre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Intention</HI> of God Himself in the Creation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Things should direct and govern you. Surely you should exactly conform to the Sovereign Design of Him that made them.</P>
<P>REMEMBER then, that God has made a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Things firstly for Himself and for His So<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> reign Glory; and if you dont devote you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> selves to God, you don't comply with th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Design</HI> of your great Creator. If you do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Improve your selves and all you have for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Glory</HI> of God; you live and act in a bold op∣position to His Design and End in making them: you presumptuously abuse the Thing of God which he has made for His Glory: an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you vilely pervert them from the Ends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> proposed, to ends of your own.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="002256_0076_0FDADDCA6153A590"/>
BUT in a peculiar manner God has bro't <HI>you</HI> out of nothing and Formed you, To <HI>Glo∣rify and Injoy Him forever.</HI> This was God's great Design in Creating and Forming you; To Glorify and Serve Him with the highest Delight, and to Enjoy Him for ever. These are the <HI>Two</HI> great Ends of God in making and sending you into the World: and don't you think that they oblige you to mind them? Can you imagine, you may be allowed to neg∣lect the very <HI>Ends</HI> for which God has so won∣derfully made you and sent you into the World? Can you dare to cross them, or live in a contrariety to them? Oh how horrid and heinous is this, and how incensing to your Sovereign and Almighty Creator!</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>GOD takes a</HI> Sovereign <HI>and</HI> Providen∣tial Care <HI>of</HI> all <HI>His Works, and a</HI> Particular Care <HI>of</HI> you: <HI>and therefore you ought to be Devoted to God.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Argument rises from the <HI>Work</HI> and <HI>Design</HI> of <HI>Providence.</HI> God having Created the World, He does not desert; But He con∣tinually exercises a <HI>Sovereign Providence</HI> over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, and every thing He has made. And God having bro't <HI>you</HI> out of nothing, and made <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou</HI> to shew forth His Praises; He takes a <HI>Particular Care</HI> of <HI>you,</HI> that you may answer the End of your Being. <HI>Children!</HI> You are the Peculiar <HI>Care</HI> of <HI>Providence;</HI> and there∣fore you ought to be Devoted to God.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="002256_0077_0FDADDCC084585F0"/>
AND in this <HI>Care</HI> of <HI>Providence</HI> there are these <HI>Four</HI> Things;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD is</HI> your <HI>Continual and Intire</HI> Preser∣ver, <HI>and of</HI> all Things else: <HI>and therefore you should be Intirely Devoted to Him.</HI></P>
<P>GOD <HI>Upholds</HI> the whole Creation by a con∣stant act of His Power and Wisdom: and thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if possible continually increases His Right and Interest in it. There is nothing in all the World, but always needs His supporting Hand. If God withdrew the Exercise of H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Sovereign <HI>Wisdom,</HI> they would quickly ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into the last Confusion. And if God with held the Exercise of His Sovereign <HI>Power</HI> they would immediately vanish to nothing God continually bears up the Pillars both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Heaven and Earth. He continually support and upholds them, and every thing in them both in their Being &amp; Order. <HI>Heb.</HI> 1.3. They in∣tirely depend upon God to Preserve them. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be sure He <HI>Sustains</HI> them for the <HI>same De∣sign</HI> for which He has made them. He up∣holds them, that they may accomplish the Glorious End of their Almighty Creation.</P>
<P>AND in Particular God is <HI>your Great Pre∣server.</HI> You intirely and constantly Depe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> upon Him for the continuance of your Life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Being. As God has <HI>granted</HI> you <HI>Life &amp; Fa∣vour:</HI> so it is His <HI>Visitation</HI> that has <HI>Prese<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ved</HI> your <HI>Spirit,</HI> Job 10.12. God is you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Constant and Supream Supporter and De∣fender. He continually holds your Souls <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Life, and Protects your Lives from mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tudes
<PB N="23" REF="002256_0077_0FDADDCC084585F0"/>of Evils that wou'd soon Destroy them. God has <HI>All along</HI> been your Great Preserver: And He <HI>Now</HI> Upholds you and Bares you up from sinking into nothing, Death and Misery. If God had not continually Protected and Up∣held you; you had long before this Time gone down with multitudes of other Chil∣dren into the <HI>Rotting Grave.</HI> You had been before this Time Consumed to Ashes; or the Worms had now been Feeding on you, as they are on others. And if you have not given yourselves to God, you had now been suffering with multitudes of other wicked Children the <HI>Vengeance of Eternal Fire.</HI></P>
<P>AND now Consider <HI>Children!</HI> How great and constant are your Obligations to Devote yourselves and Live to God, in whom you <HI>Live and Move and have</HI> your <HI>Being,</HI> Acts 17.28. Every Hour God upholds your Lives, He adds the more to your great and multi∣plied Obligations. And every Hour you neg∣lect to give your Hearts to God, you dread∣fully increase your Guilt and Sin, against Him. O <HI>Sinful Children!</HI> How contrary do you Walk to God! While God is Heaping Obligations on you, you are most ungrateful∣ly affronting and abusing Him. What! wou'd you have God Preserve <HI>His Creatures,</HI> that you may abuse them to His Dishonour? Or would you have God uphold <HI>your Lives,</HI> that you may Sin the more against Him? — How in∣expressibly black and horrid is this extream Ingratitude and Impiety!</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="24" REF="002256_0078_0FDADDCD88489B00"/>
2. <HI>GOD is the</HI> Sovereign Observer <HI>of</HI> all Things, <HI>and He takes a</HI> Particular Notice <HI>of</HI> you: <HI>and therefore you should be intirely Devo∣ted to Him.</HI></P>
<P>GOD must needs <HI>Observe</HI> the Things H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has made, To see if they answer the Ends o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> His making them. He must needs <HI>Observe</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they are Improved, or Abused, and Pervert∣ed, from His Service and Honour which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Created them for.</P>
<P>BUT in a peculiar manner, the Eye of God is upon <HI>the Children of Men,</HI> the Master-piec<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Lord of His Work in this lower World Prov. 5.21. <HI>For the ways of man are before th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> eyes of the Lord, and he pondereth all his going<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Yea, He Pondereth the <HI>Hearts</HI> of Men. <HI>Prov</HI> 21.2.

<PB N="25" REF="002256_0078_0FDADDCD88489B00"/>Observes your <HI>Obedience,</HI> that He may Reward and Bless you. And He Observes your <HI>Faults,</HI> that He may Chastize and Punish you. <HI>Jer.</HI> 32.19. And <HI>Chap.</HI> 17.10. Now <HI>Children!</HI> What a Great and Solemn Obligation is this upon you, To give up your Hearts and Lives to God! When the Glorious and Watchful Eyes of God are always on you, and He care∣fully Looks both to your Hearts and Actions. When He Views and Ponders all your Ways: And when He looks to see How you use or a∣buse His Creatures. When He looks upon you with a Gracious Eye of <HI>Love and Favour,</HI> if you be intirely Devoted to Him; but with a dreadful Eye of <HI>Anger,</HI> if you Live and Walk in your own Devices.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>GOD is the Supream and</HI> Sovereign Lord <HI>and Ruler</HI> of all the World, <HI>and in a peculiar manner</HI> your Sovereign Lord: <HI>And therefore you should be intirely given up to Him.</HI></P>
<P>GOD has an absolute Right to <HI>Govern</HI> the Things he has made, and which he continually upholds by a Sovereign Act of his Power and Wisdom. He has an Eternal Right to Give his Creatures, what <HI>Laws</HI> he Pleases, and to <HI>Rule</HI> them as he sees Good. And as God has such a Right, he is infinitely capable of Maintaining and Improving it, according to his Sovereign Pleasure. God therefore Or∣ders and Rules the World and all Things in it as he Pleases. Psal. 103.19. <HI>His King∣dom ruleth over all.</HI> Eph. 1.11. And <HI>He worketh all things after the counsel of his own will.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002256_0079_0FDADDCF158C9DE8"/>
AND among the Rest <HI>You</HI> are also Subject to his <HI>Laws</HI> and <HI>Government.</HI> God is your <HI>Sove∣reign</HI> Lord and King: And his Sovereign Will and Pleasure is to Controul and Govern you. He has given you <HI>Laws</HI> to Guide you in your Obedience to him: And his Laws are strictly Holy, Just and Good. Mic. 6.8. <HI>He hath shewed the O man what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do just∣ly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</HI> And as God gives you <HI>Laws,</HI> so he Actually <HI>Rules</HI> and Governs you according to his Sovereign Pleasure. Dan. 4.35. <HI>And he doth according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth; and none can stay his Hand, or say unto him what doest thou.</HI></P>
<P>AND how strongly are you then obliged to Devote your selves and Live to God? It is the highest Justice, that you should intirely yield obedience to His Sovereign Laws and Government. <HI>Youth and Children!</HI> Can you think your selves exempted from the Sovereign Will and Government of God? Can any of you Think that God gives you Leave to Trample on His Supream Authori∣ty, and Rebel against Him? Or can you pos∣sibly Imagine that you may Reject His Laws, abuse His Creatures, and Resist Him as you Please, and God not Resent it? — O <HI>No! Vain Youth!</HI> GOD will some time or other make you dearly Know that He is your Sovereign Lord and Ruler; and that you shall not harden
<PB N="27" REF="002256_0079_0FDADDCF158C9DE8"/>yourselves against Him, and go unpunished.</P>
<P N="4">4. AND lastly therefore, <HI>GOD is the Righte∣ous and</HI> Sovereign Judge and Rewarder, <HI>and He'l</HI> Judge and Recompence you <HI>just as</HI> you de∣serve: <HI>and this is another Great and Solemn Obligation on you to be devoted to Him in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P>IT is most fit and necessary, that He who made, upholds, Observes and Rules the World, should also <HI>Judge</HI> it. God best only knows the Good and Righteous Ends for which He made it: and He knows best how far they have been perverted or advanced. The Great and Sovereign Lord of Heaven and Earth must needs take care to maintain the Glory of his Authority and Power, and do Justice to Himself. And therefore God must <HI>Judge</HI> the World.</P>
<P>AGREABLY to this we find in Act. 17.31. That <HI>He hath appointed a Day wherein He will Judge the World in Righteousness, by that Man whom He hath ordained,</HI> even Christ; <HI>whereof He hath given assurance unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from the Dead.</HI></P>
<P>AND let me tell you, <HI>O Youth and Children!</HI> God will surely <HI>Judge You</HI> with he rest of Men; and He'l give you your just Deserts. If <HI>the Judgment</HI> does not come <HI>before you Die,</HI> as there is none on Earth is certain but it may come to Night; yet <HI>after Death</HI> then comes the Judgment, <HI>Heb.</HI> 9.27. Your <HI>Souls</HI> will then immediately be Judg'd by God, and either Doom'd to be Bound and Reserv'd with
<PB N="28" REF="002256_0080_0FDADDD084FFD4B8"/><HI>Devils</HI> in Chains of Darkness or Transported with the <HI>Saints</HI> to Paradise, till the <HI>Resur∣rection</HI> of your <HI>Bodies</HI> and the <HI>Judgment</HI> of the Great Day. Then your Bodies shall be raised from the Dead, and your Souls shall join them; and <HI>ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the Right Hand of Power and coming in the Clouds of Heaven,</HI> Mat. 26.64. And, <HI>When the Son of Man shall come in His Glory and all His Holy Angels with Him; then shall He sit upon the Throne of His Glory, and be∣fore Him shall be gathered all Nations,</HI> Mat. 25.31, 32. <HI>For we must all appear before the Judg∣ment Seat of Christ; that every one may re∣ceive the Things done in his body according to that he has don<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whether it be good or bad,</HI> 2 Cor. 5.10. <HI>The son of man shall come in the Glory of His Father with His Angels; and then He shall Reward to every man according to his works,</HI> Mat. 16.17. Then the Dead <HI>Small</HI> and <HI>Great</HI> shall stand before God: The Books of God's Remembrance and Omniscience shall then be opened: and the Dead shall be Judged out of those Things which were writ∣ten in the Books according to their Works. The <HI>Sea</HI> shall give up the Dead therein, and <HI>Death and Hell</HI> shall deliver up the Dead in them: and they shall be Judged every one according to their Works. And whosoever shall not be found written in the Book of Life shall be cast into the <HI>Lake of Fire,</HI> Rev. 20.12—15.</P>

AND Oh! <HI>Youth and Children!</HI> How great∣ly does this oblige you to Devote your selves, and Live to God? Oh! How subject and obedient should you be to Him that is your Sovereign Judge; and who now observes you, that He may hereafter Judge, and give you Righteous Judgment? You may <HI>Rejoyce O Young Man in thy Youth, and let thy Heart chear thee in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Days of thy Youth, and walk in the ways of thine Heart and in the sight of thine eyes; But know thou that for all these things God will bring thee into Judgment.</HI> Thus the wise Man tells you in <HI>Eccl.</HI> 11.9. and in the following Chapter, and the <HI>two</HI> last verses, <HI>Let us hear the Conclusion of the whole matter; Fear God and keep his Commandments; For this is the whole duty of man: For God will bring every work into Judgment, with every secret Thing, whether it be good or whither it be evil.</HI> And <HI>Prov.</HI> 24.12. <HI>If thou sayest, Behold we knew it not; Doth not He that pondereth the Heart consider it?

<P N="4">IV. <HI>GOD's wonderful.</HI> Grace and Kindness to you <HI>is a vast and infinite</HI> Obligation <HI>on you<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to give your Hearts to Him in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P>I might have reduced this under the <HI>Two</HI> last General Heads: But <HI>This Kind</HI> of Obli∣gation is so peculiar, and so exceeding vast and comprehensive, that I think it best to be considered by it self. It contains Ten Thou∣sand
<PB N="30" REF="002256_0081_0FDADDD26FC98540"/>times Ten Thousand Obligations in it, even as many as are your <HI>Sins &amp; Mercies.</HI> Every Mercy is a great Engagement to you: And I had as good go to Reckon the <HI>Spires of Grass,</HI> or the <HI>Sands of the Sea shore</HI> as the Mercies of God. But in <HI>General,</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD</HI> Has been <HI>wonderfully Kind and Gra∣cious to you:</HI> And therefore <HI>you are under the highest Obligations to give up your Hearts to God.</HI></P>
<P>GOD has been wonderfully Kind in <HI>your very Creation.</HI> God has not made you <HI>Brutes,</HI> but <HI>Reasonable Creatures.</HI> God has made you Capable of Knowing, Loving, Serving, Injoy∣ing Him, and of being Beloved and made Happy in Him for ever. God has given to many of you healthy and comely <HI>Bodies:</HI> And He has given you all most Precious and Immortal <HI>Souls.</HI> He has given you your Un∣derstanding, your Wit, your Memory, your Vivacity, your Easiness to Learn, your Tongues, your Utterance, your tunable Voices; and all your other Natural Indowments.</P>
<P>GOD has been also very Gracious to you in the <HI>Circumstance, Time and Place of your Bir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> He has bro't forth many of you of Rich and Ho∣nourable Parents: And what is a Thousand times a greater Priviledge, God has made many of you to come of those that are Ver∣tuous and Godly. The most of you are Born in His Gracious <HI>Covenant:</HI> a distinguishing Favour. Yea God had been graciously pro∣viding for you <HI>before ever He made you.</HI> He had planted His Gospel in this Age of the
<PB N="31" REF="002256_0081_0FDADDD26FC98540"/>World and in these Ends of the Earth; and He had bro't the most of your Parents into the Bonds of the Covenant. He has made the <HI>Lines</HI> to fall to you <HI>in pleasant Places,</HI> and has given you <HI>a goodly Heritage,</HI> Psal. 16.5, 6.</P>
<P>GOD has been gracious to you <HI>ever since you were Born.</HI> He has Fed you, Cloath'd you, nourish'd you, and has made you to increase and grow. He has tenderly watched over you both by Night and Day. He has order∣ed it that the most among you should be <HI>Bap∣tized</HI> and have a Good and Happy Education. He has advanced you in Knowledge, Under∣standing, Learning: And to many among you He has graciously continued one or both of your <HI>Parents</HI> alive; and where they are Dead, he has graciously raised up <HI>Friends</HI> to take care of you, to Cherish, Protect, Advise and Guide you.</P>
<P>GOD has been wonderfully Gracious in multitudes of <HI>Temporal Blessing</HI> and Comforts. How often has God defended and saved you in the midst of Dangers? How often has God delivered you from Sickness and other Afflictions? How many Temporal Benefits has he daily bestowed upon you? You know not the Number. GOD has given to many of you the invaluable Mercies of Strength and Health, and tho' you may yet be insensible of so great a Priviledge; yet God has granted you to live in a Place of many Precious Civil Liberties.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="002256_0082_0FDADDD389E50520"/>
BUT above all God has been wonderfully gracious to you, in what he has <HI>Done by Christ for your Eternal Salvation and Happiness.</HI> When you were Condemned, Lost and Pe∣rishing Sinners; God from His Astonishing and Sovereign Grace has given his only and <HI>Eternal Son</HI> to Dye to Redeem you. Herein he has shewn his Astonishing and So∣vereign Love; that when you were ungodly, <HI>Christ</HI> Dyed to save you. And when Christ has Dyed to purchase your Eternal Redemp∣tion; God has sent forth <HI>His Spirit</HI> to Con∣vert you and bring you to it. <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.5,—8.</P>
<P>GOD has distinguished his Grace, in bestow∣ing on you a multitude of <HI>Spiritual Priviledges,</HI> and Advantages. He has allowed you the means of Grace and Eternal Life. He has given you the knowledge of Christ and his glorious Gospel. The Things which he has hidden from multitudes of the Wise and Prudent of the Earth, He has revealed to you. He has given you his blessed Word: and to every one among you I may say as the Apostle in 2 Tim. 3.15. <HI>And that from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> child thou hast known the holy Scriptures, which are able to make thee wise unto Salvation, thro' Faith which is in Christ Jesus.</HI> God has also granted you the pure Ordinances of his House and Worship. God has given you most ex∣cellent <HI>Catechisms,</HI> and Trained you up in the most material Truths of Revealed Religion.</P>
<P>GOD has sent you multitudes of Instructi∣ons, Warnings, Councils, Examples, Encou∣ragements,
<PB N="33" REF="002256_0082_0FDADDD389E50520"/>Corrections. He has given you the hearing of a great many Sermons. He has given you the priviledge of multitudes of Prayers. He has innumerable Times made you the Offers of Grace and Salvation: He has earnestly Sollicited you to accept and embrace them. He has often set Eternal Life and Death before you, and urged you to the Choice of Eternal Life and Happiness.</P>
<P>AND in <HI>Fine,</HI> GOD has given you a great many powerful Convictions of Conscience, and the workings of his holy Spirit; To open your Eyes and to turn you from Dark∣ness to Light and from the power of Satan to God; that you may receive the forgive∣neess of your Sins and Inheritance among all them which are Sanctifyed thro' Faith in Christ. <HI>Acts</HI> 26.18.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>GOD</HI> is Still <HI>very wonderfully Gracious to you: and</HI> therefore <HI>you are exceedingly obliged to give up your Hearts unto Him in your Youth∣ful Days.</HI></P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all your daring Sin and Contempt of God, He is yet <HI>uphold∣ing</HI> and <HI>sparing</HI> you from your deserved Pu∣nishment. <HI>The Devils</HI> are your malicious Enemies; and as roaring Lions they would fall upon you and dreadfully torment and devour you, but that God continually restrains them. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.5. Tho' you have constantly abused the Riches of God's Goodness; He is yet continuing them unto you. You are yet the amazing <HI>Monuments</HI> of his Mercy, Pa∣tience
<PB N="34" REF="002256_0083_OFDADDD50BC1F2E0"/>and Forbearance. O that you might now be led to Repentance by them!</P>
<P>GOD continues to you multitudes of <HI>Tem∣poral Blessings.</HI> You can look on nothing, you can think of nothing, but you behold a Mercy of God's bestowing: and He still pre∣serves your most Precious <HI>Lives,</HI> whereby alone you can enjoy and relish them. He keeps you every moment from dropping into <HI>Hell,</HI> while you are abusing His Patience. And He is filling your unthankful and unfruitful Lives with a great variety and abundance of Delights and Comforts.</P>
<P>HE continues to you multitudes of <HI>Spiritual Advantages.</HI> The means of Grace, and the hopes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ory: His powerful restraints on many violent Lusts: and the lively helps of <HI>His Spirit</HI> to inlighten, awaken, convert and comfort you, and lead you in the way Ever∣lasting.</P>
<P>YEA God is even at this very moment <HI>using Means</HI> to save you and bring you to Eternal Happiness. He grants you this very Oppor∣tunity of hearing the Things that concern your Everlasting Peace and Welfare. He now brings <HI>Me</HI> to Preach the words of Eternal Life unto you, <HI>to You, O Youth and Children;</HI> and he brings <HI>You</HI> now to hear them, that your Souls may live.</P>
<P>GOD takes not any Pleasure in your Death and Destruction: He delights not in your Ruin and Misery: He is loath to give you up and Destroy you: He had rather you should
<PB N="35" REF="002256_0083_0FDADDD50BC1F2E0"/>turn from your Sins and be Saved, and He greatly desires it. He commands me to tell you as in Ezek. 33.11. <HI>Say unto them, As I live saith the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways: for why will ye die O house of Israel?</HI></P>
<P>IN Fine, God is <HI>Ready</HI> to Receive and For∣give you. He is ready to be Reconciled E∣ternally to you: and to enter into an Ever∣lasting Covenant of Grace and Friendship with you. He is ready to make you His Children for ever, and to give you a right to all the Priviledges of the Sons of God. He is ready to Bless you <HI>with all Spiritual Blessings in Heavenly Things in Christ.</HI> He is perfectly free and ready to save you and make you happy for ever. After all your heinous Sins and slights of his Grace and Mercy; God now repeats his compassionate calls and tenders to you. He <HI>Invites</HI> and calls you, as in Isai. 55.3. <HI>Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear and your soul shall live, and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even the sure mercies of David.</HI></P>
<P>YEA God and Christ now <HI>Intreat</HI> and urge you to be Reconciled to God. For God <HI>hath committed to us</HI> his Ministers <HI>the word of Re∣concilation: Now then we are Embassadors for Christ, as tho' God did beseech you by us; we pray you now in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God.—We then as workers together with them beseech you also that ye receive not his
<PB N="36" REF="002256_0084_0FDADDDA227211C8"/>Grace in vain. For he hath said I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in a day of salva∣tion have I succoured thee: Behold now is the accepted time, Behold now is the Day of Salva∣tion.</HI> 2 Cor. 5.19—6.2.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>ALL these Mercies flow from God's Abso∣lutely</HI> Free, Sovereign and Distinguishing Grace: <HI>and this is a vast Obligation to Give up your selves unto Him.</HI></P>
<P>YOU deserve not the least of these Mer∣cies. You deserve to be intirely and for ever banished from the Favour of God and all his Goodness. You were Born full of Sin and Enmity to Him: and <HI>Hell</HI> was your deserved Portion as soon as ever you came into the World: And ever since, you have hardly done any thing else but forgotten, neglected, slighted, and rebelled against Him. You have abused His Mercies disobeyed His Voice, dishonoured His Name, and cast His Autho∣rity under your Feet. Alas! You have hard∣ly done any thing else but abounding and growing in Sin, Repeating your Affronts of your Great Creator, and deserving a severer misery. Oh! How exceeding great are your Sins and Guilt under the invaluable means you have enjoy'd! and how <HI>Wonderful</HI> is the Forbearance and Long-suffering of God!</P>
<P>HOW <HI>Distinguishing</HI> is His Goodness and Patience to you! How many Millions of Children have never enjoyed your Mercies? How many Millions have perished and are
<PB N="37" REF="002256_0084_0FDADDDA227211C8"/>perishing in the Heathen World? Oh how many Millions of other Children are now <HI>in the Grave</HI> and in <HI>Hell</HI> who came into the World since you, and were not such heinous Sinners; while God preserves you from going down into the Pit, and from the dreadful place of your Torment!</P>
<P>AND now <HI>O Children!</HI> How innumerable and vast are your Obligations to be Devoted to God? What could God have done more for you than He has done? Would you have Him to have given you <HI>Heaven</HI> and Glory against your Wills? Why he has sent his Son to Purchase them for you; He hath Offer'd them to you; He has us'd all the means you can devise, and more, that he might bring you to the happy Possession. If you yet refuse Him your Hearts, when he has done so much to Deserve them, and at the same time give them to the vile Pleasures of Sin or the Trifles of the World; How great and inexpressible is your Guilt and Ingrati∣tude? You deserve a thousand times greater Punishment than <HI>Gomorrah</HI> or <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dom;</HI> and if you Die in your Sins, God will surely give it you. <HI>I beseech you therefore</HI> (Children,) <HI>by the Mercies of God, that you present your Bo∣dies</HI> (and Souls) <HI>a living sacrifice, holy and accep∣table unto God which is your reasonable service,</HI> Rom. 12.1.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="38" REF="002256_0085_0FDADDDB0FDF1088"/>
V. <HI>YOU still Continually and Intirely</HI> Depend upon God <HI>for all that is Good:</HI> And therefore <HI>you are under the highest Obligations to be Devo∣ted to Him.</HI></P>
<P>YOU cannot <HI>Live</HI> or Subsist a moment longer without the Continuance of His sup∣porting Goodness and Power. You can't have any Comfort or Mercy that you <HI>Want,</HI> unless God Bestow it. You can't have any that you <HI>Possess</HI> continued to you, unless God continue it. You still intirely <HI>Depend</HI> upon God for <HI>every Mercy,</HI> both for Soul and Body, for Time and for Eternity. You still Intirely and Continually Depend upon God, to Defend and Preserve you from multitudes of <HI>Tempo∣ral Evils:</HI> Yea, to keep you out of Hell and <HI>Eternal Miseries.</HI></P>
<P>AND surely <HI>Children!</HI> Such a state of con∣stant and absolute <HI>Dependance</HI> upon God is one of the strongest Obligations. When you still continually Depend upon God both for Being. Preservation and Happiness, for every Thing you want and for every Thing you have; can you yet Refuse to Live to God: You most un∣gratefully and madly Sin against your own Happiness and Mercies.</P>
<P>DO you not Reckon it a vast Obligation upon you to be Devoted to your <HI>Parents,</HI> be∣cause your Dependance is on them to keep and support you and contrive for your Com∣fort, and when you come of Age to give you a Portion? And how vastly greater is your
<PB N="39" REF="002256_0085_0FDADDDB0FDF1088"/>Obligation to be Devoted to <HI>God</HI> your <HI>Hea∣venly Father?</HI> When your Parents as well as yourselves have an Intire <HI>Dependance</HI> upon Him both for the Preservation of Life, for a Temporal Subsistence and Comfort, and for an Eternal Inheritance.</P>
<P>BUT I must not Inlarge.</P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>YEA the very</HI> Light of Nature, Reason and Natural Conscience <HI>Oblige you to be Devo∣ted to God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>CHILDREN!</HI> You are Born into the World with a <HI>Sense</HI> of this Great and Fundamental Duty. It naturally rises from the Power and Light of your Minds: And is one of the First Dictates of Reason.</P>
<P>GOD Himself has set up a shining Light in you to Lead you to Him. The <HI>Wise Man</HI> therefore tells us, Prov. 20.27. <HI>The spirit of man is the candle of the Lord: searching the in∣ward parts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>elly.</HI> This <HI>Spirit of Man</HI> is his <HI>Reasonable Soul and Conscience:</HI> And it is <HI>the Candle</HI> or Light <HI>of the Lord.</HI> God has kind∣led it, inspired it and set it up in you; to show you your Duty, and to help you to Dis∣cern and Judge of yourselves and your Acti∣ons: And this <HI>Heavenly Light</HI> shows you, as soon as ever you come to Know any Thing of God, that you should be Devoted to Him. It clearly and strongly Convinces you; that this is a most important and indispensa∣ble Duty. And when you Refuse to give up yourselves unto God; <HI>This Light of your Con∣sciences</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="002256_0086_0FDADDDC8E63C2F8"/>clearly Discerns it, It shows you your Wickedness, and Terribly Reproves and Threatens you. You may often neglect it and desparately Try to <HI>Quench</HI> and Destroy it: But it Burns so strongly, that it can never be in∣tirely Extinguished. It is the Faithful Deputy and Witness of God: The Eternal Judge which He has set up in your Souls: And it will never utterly Leave you.</P>
<P><HI>CHILDREN!</HI> The very natural <HI>Light</HI> of your <HI>Reason and Conscience</HI> oblige you therefore to be Devoted to God. It plainly and irresisti∣bly shows you this Duty. <HI>In the name and stead of God,</HI> it Peremptorily re∣quires you to do it. It solemnly warns you to refuse it at your Peril. If you are devoted to God; it approves and rejoyces you: But if you keep your Hearts from Him; It will accuse, convince and reprove you: and it will more or less dreadfully condemn and punish you, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.14, 15.</P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>THE</HI> Word of God <HI>which is His</HI> Re∣vealed Will and Law <HI>does in a more especial manner</HI> Oblige you <HI>to Devote yourselves is Him.</HI></P>
<P>THE Word of God as you have Learnt is contained in the <HI>Holy Scriptures:</HI> And the Apostle assures you in 2 Tim. 3.16. <HI>All Scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for in∣struction in righteousness.</HI> It is an Express Re∣velation of the Mind and Will of God con∣cerning
<PB N="41" REF="002256_0086_0FDADDDC8E63C2F8"/>the Children of Men, and of the way of our Eternal Salvation and Happiness. It is an abundantly clearer and fuller Discovery than the Light of Nature can possibly yield us. God has sent it, Oh Children <HI>to You:</HI> And it is a vast addition to your Obligations from your natural Reason and Conscience to be Devoted to God.</P>
<P>O YOUTH and Children! Here is the Will of the Great and Sovereign GOD expresly Revealed and Proclaimed to you. And <HI>Every Thing</HI> Revealed in His Word Obliges you to give yourselves to Him. It is even Firstly Revealed and Written for this great End and Purpose. Psal. 78.5—7. <HI>For he established a a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which He commanded our fathers; that they should make them known to their children: That the ge∣neration to come might know them, even the children which should be born: which should a∣rise and declare them to their children: That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God; but keep his commandments:</HI></P>
<P>IN <HI>General,</HI> All the Instructions and Truths contained in the Scriptures are both a means and ingagement to Lead you to God. All the Counsels and Exhortations in them: All the Warnings and severe Reproofs: All the Commands and Institutions: All the Graci∣ous Promises and Terrible Threatnings: All the Instances both of Sin and of Goodness, and especially of Early Religion: All the Examples both of Judgment &amp; Mercy: And in Fine, all the
<PB N="42" REF="002256_0087_0FDADDDE08E7F7E0"/>Gracious Invitations and Directions that are given in Scripture, are Designed as a means to Bring you to God; and are Great and High Obligations on you to give yourselves to Him.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Particular,</HI> GOD therein Expresly Re∣quires and calls you to give up your Hearts to Him in the Time of your Youth. Thus it is Expresly Required in the <HI>Text:</HI> And surely, when God has once Expresly Requi∣red it, 'tis enough to Oblige you: He has Declared His Will, and He need say no more.</P>
<P>HOWEVER I shall mention a few more Pla∣ces; that the Revealed Will and Command of God may appear more clearly, and come with a stronger Influence on you. Psal. 34. 11,—14. <HI>Come ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord,</HI> &amp;c. Prov. 8.32,—36. <HI>Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways,</HI> &amp;c. Exod. 22.29. <HI>Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy ripe fruits, and — the first born of thy sons shalt thou give unto me.</HI> Prov. 3.9. <HI>Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the first fruits of all thine increase.</HI> Mat. 6.33. <HI>But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righ∣teousness, and all thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> things shall be added un∣to you.</HI> Eccl. 12.1. <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth</HI>—. Prov. 24.21. <HI>My son fear thou the Lord</HI> —. 1 Chron. 28.9. <HI>And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind: for the Lord searcheth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="43" REF="002256_0087_0FDADDDE08E7F7E0"/>hearts, and understandeth all the Imaginations of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Thoughts: If thou seck him, he will be found <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff forever.</HI> 2 Tim. 2.22. <HI>Flee also Youthful Lusts: But follow Righteousness, faith, charity, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eace with them that call on the Lord out of a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure heart.</HI> Psal. 148.12, 13. <HI>Both Young Men <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Maidens, Old Men and Children. Let them Praise the Name of the Lord: for his Name alone <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> excellent, his Glory is above the earth and hea∣ven.</HI></P>
<P N="8">VIII. <HI>YOU are under the highest Obligations <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o give up yourselves to God;</HI> Because <HI>it is of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he</HI> Highest Importance <HI>and</HI> Necessity <HI>to You.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is nothing in the World of greater <HI>Moment</HI> or <HI>Necessity.</HI> There is no∣thing of greater Importance to the Glory and Honour of God, the Good &amp; Welfare of Others, or Your own Salvation and Happiness.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Glory and Honour of GOD</HI> your Creator <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s highly concerned in the Devotion of your∣selves to Him. In the very <HI>Giving up</HI> your∣selves to God, you do Greatly Honour Him: And in <HI>Refusing</HI> or Neglecting it, You <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o exceedingly Dishonour Him in the Eyes of <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Angels.</HI> And then a <HI>Life of Obe∣dience</HI> and Service whereby God is great∣ly Glorifyed, does intirely depend upon the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evoting your selves to Him. If you resign your selves to God, you will live to His Ho∣nour; But if you refuse to give your selves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Him, you will continue to dishonour Him <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Rob Him of His Glory.</P>

AND as the Glory and Honour of God, so the <HI>Good and Welfare of Others</HI> Require and Oblige you to be Devoted to Him. God re∣quires you to Promote the Welfare of <HI>Others:</HI> And if you give up your selves to <HI>God;</HI> in subjection and subordination to Him, you will be devoted to the Service of <HI>Men.</HI> With an Holy and Ardent Zeal for His Honour and Glory; You will earnestly Labour to pro∣mote their Temporal and Eternal Welfare.</P>
<P>BUT especially the Devoting your selves to God is of the greatest Importance and Ne∣cessity to <HI>Your own Salvation and Happiness.</HI> Children! You are by Nature in a state of Sin: You are condemned by God to Eternal Misery: You can never deliver your selves: And if you give not up your selves to God thro' Christ, you can never be saved. There is <HI>no other way</HI> to be saved from Hell and E∣ternal Misery: And if this be intirely and heartily done and continued in, you shall surely be saved from them. And surely the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Great <HI>Law of Necessity</HI> and <HI>Self-Preservation</HI> which is one of the <HI>First Laws of Nature,</HI> oblige you to be Devoted unto God. And the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> unless you give your selves to God, you can <HI>never be Happy:</HI> For you can never have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> share in His Favour, and you can never injoy Him; who is the only suitable and <HI>Perfe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Happiness,</HI> and Satisfactory Portion.</P>
<P N="9">IX. <HI>YOU are under the highest Obligation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be Devoted to God;</HI> Because <HI>it is most</HI> highly pleasing <HI>both to</HI> God, Angels <HI>and</HI> Men.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="002256_0088_0FDADDDF8BA454D8"/>
IT is most highly Pleasing <HI>to God:</HI> For in this you Obey &amp; Honour Him, you are in the way to be Saved and Happy, to do Good in the World, and to answer the <HI>Great Ends</HI> of your Being. God beholds you with sin∣gular Delight and Pleasure: He highly ap∣proves, esteems and commends you: and He very dearly loves you. Prov. 8.17. <HI>I Love them that love me, and those that seek me Early shall find me.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, It is most highly Pleasing to the <HI>Glorious Angels.</HI> Those Pure and Heavenly Creatures are most intirely devoted to God: <HI>They</HI> are perfectly <HI>Happy</HI> in their conformity to Him; and they exquisitely desire and de∣light to see <HI>You</HI> so too. They are extreamly displeas'd at your Living without God in the World: But when you Repent and Give your selves to Him; the glad Tydings are carried to Heaven, and then there is Joy over you among <HI>the Angels of God,</HI> Luk. 15.10.</P>
<P>AND then this is also most highly pleasing to the <HI>Best and Greatest of Men.</HI> King <HI>David</HI> himself esteemed <HI>the Saints</HI> to be the most <HI>Excellent in the Earth,</HI> and in them was his highest Earthly <HI>Delight,</HI> Psal. 16.3. And the Divine <HI>Apostle</HI> tells the <HI>Elect Lady,</HI> and so will all your Pious <HI>Ministers</HI> speak to your Pa∣rents, as in 2 Joh. 4. <HI>I rejoyced greatly that I found of thy Children walking in truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.</HI></P>
<P>TO be sure, your Early Devotion to God will be exceedingly delightful to your Reli∣gious
<PB N="46" REF="002256_0089_0FDADDE1774C18F0"/>and Sollicitous <HI>Parents.</HI> It will be their Great Honour and Joy; as your neglect of Piety will be their most sensible Disgrace and Sorrow. Prov. 10.1. <HI>A Wise Son make to a Glad Father: But a Foolish Son is the Heaviness of his Mother.</HI></P>
<P>CHILDREN! Your Early Piety will be abundantly <HI>Pleasing</HI> both to <HI>God, An∣gels</HI> and <HI>Men;</HI> as your continuing in Sin does extreamly Offend them. And this does there∣fore highly oblige you to be Devoted to God.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>These Things</HI> will be more largely Handled in the <HI>Next Discourse</HI> concerning the GREAT ADVANTAGES <HI>of Early Religion.</HI></P>
<P N="10">X. <HI>YOUR</HI> Baptismal Devotion <HI>is a Great, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Solemn &amp; most indispensable</HI> Ingagement <HI>on you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o give up your Hearts to God in your Early Days.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a wonderful <HI>Grace</HI> of God that when you were vile, abominable and sinful Wretches, and could do nothing for His Service; that yet He was Free to receive you into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Gracious Covenant,</HI> and take you into His par∣ticular Care. And it was a distinguishing Kindness of God, to bring you forth in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Age and Place of the World; and of <HI>Believi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Parents,</HI> whom He had brought into a pecu∣liar Relation to Himself, and into the Bonds of the Covenant: And that as soon as yo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> came into the World, they solemnly <HI>Offere<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> you up</HI> to God to be His own for ever. They did it by His <HI>Divine Appointment:</HI> They did it in <HI>Baptism,</HI> as a Publick Seal of the Cove∣nant: And then God was pleas'd to receive
<PB N="47" REF="002256_0089_0FDADDE1774C18F0"/>you into it, and to take you into His Gracious and Peculiar Care.</P>
<P>AND indeed your Parents have offer'd <HI>No more</HI> to God than what was <HI>His own</HI> Before; Being just come out of His Creating and Form∣ing Hands, and made to serve and enjoy Him. But God having made you <HI>Their</HI> Children, the Children of His Covenant People, He would have them to offer you to Him; that <HI>You</HI> might also be bro't into the Covenant with them, and have the Benefits of it. If they, had not done it; they had been <HI>Unkind and cruel</HI> as the <HI>Ostriches</HI> of the Wilderness. For God had told <HI>Abraham</HI> the Father of Believers, that the Man Child who receives not the Seal of the Covenant; <HI>That Soul</HI> should be cut off from His People, having broken His Covenant, <HI>Gen.</HI> 17.14. Yea if your Parents had not thus given you to God, they had grievously <HI>Sin'd</HI> and run the desperate Hazard of being <HI>Destroyed</HI> themselves; as <HI>Moses</HI> had like to have lost his Life for neglecting to apply the Seal of the Covenant unto one of his Children, <HI>Exod.</HI> 4.24, 25.</P>
<P>AND now, <HI>Children</HI> Consider, <HI>How Solemnly you were then offered up to God.</HI></P>
<P>DESCENDING of Sinful Parents, you were conceived in Sin, you were born in Ini∣quity, and bro't forth in Pollution and Sor∣row. You were sinful, impure, and loathsome in the eyes of God. You were the <HI>Children of Wrath,</HI> and condemned to <HI>Hell.</HI> You were in a perishing and helpless Estate: and if you
<PB N="48" REF="002256_0090_0FDADDE289CF5E28"/>had dy'd in that state, you had been miserable for ever. But God then pitied you; and your Parents pitied you, and came and offered you to Him. <HI>Here</HI> they bring their poor crying Infants in Swadling Cloaths, to give them up to God. <HI>Men and Angels</HI> look on and behold the Transaction. Prayers are earnestly made for you by the Publick Assembly: And they are the <HI>Eye and Ear-Witnesses</HI> of your being Devoted to God. You are openly presented to receive the Mark of His Children: And <HI>the Name</HI> of the Great GOD, <HI>Father, Son, &amp; Holy Ghost</HI> is solemnly pronounc'd and put upon you; as a Seal of your being taken into His Holy Covenant, and a Sign that He accepts and challenges you to be His Peculiar Peo∣ple. Being offered up by Believers in the Seal of the Covenant, He takes you into His peculiar Care: And thro' the State of your <HI>Infancy,</HI> He secures your Salvation.</P>
<P>AND now <HI>O Children!</HI> God has graciously taken Care of you: He has dealt as a kind Father to you: He has nourished and kept you: He has guided and brought you to Years of Choice and Discretion: He has bro't you to this present Occasion: He offers you Eter∣nal Life and Happiness: He repeats the Offer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> He moves you to Embrace it: And you having injoyed <HI>the Benefits</HI> of His <HI>Gracious Covenant;</HI> He now expects and Requires you to perform <HI>the Duties.</HI> When He receiv'd you into it, He receiv'd you to be His peculiar People, and He then laid you under the solemnest Bonds to be devoted to Him.</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="002256_0090_0FDADDE289CF5E28"/>
IF you <HI>Refuse</HI> to give up your Hearts to this Covenant God; you most wickedly <HI>violate and profane</HI> His Covenant: You cast down His <HI>Honour</HI> with contempt on the Ground: And as you unhappily <HI>Forfeit</HI> the great and de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rable <HI>Blessings</HI> of this most ex∣cellent <HI>Covenant;</HI> so you miserably <HI>Intail</HI> on your selves the dreadful <HI>Execrations</HI> &amp; <HI>Curses</HI> that are denounced against the Violaters of it. And for your <HI>Awakening,</HI> I desire you to <HI>Read</HI> those awful <HI>Chapters,</HI> the 28 &amp; 29 of <HI>Deuteronomy;</HI> where you will most livelily see the solemn Obligations you are under to <HI>Keep the Covenant of God.</HI></P>
<P N="11">XI. <HI>THE</HI> Desires, Labours, Prayers <HI>and</HI> Ex∣pectations <HI>of your Pious</HI> Friends <HI>and</HI> Relatives, <HI>are vast</HI> Obligations <HI>on you to give up your selves to God in the Days of your Youth.</HI> And</P>
<P N="12">XII. <HI>AND Lastly,</HI> Your Knowledge <HI>of all these Things, the</HI> Inculcations <HI>of them on you, the</HI> Convictions <HI>of your</HI> Conscience, <HI>and the</HI> Strivings <HI>of the</HI> Holy Spirit <HI>of God.</HI></P>
<P>BUT your <HI>Obligations</HI> are <HI>Innumerable,</HI> and I must draw to a <HI>Close.</HI> I shall only briefly represent the PARTICULAR OBLIGATIONS you are under to give up your selves imme∣diately to God <HI>in the Days of your Youth,</HI> with∣out any <HI>Delay,</HI> and so come to a <HI>Conclusion.</HI></P>
<P>AND Here I must tell You</P>
<P>THAT the Service of God is the <HI>very De∣sign</HI> of your Beings, and of all your Mercies.</P>
<P>IT is therefore the constant and <HI>whole Work</HI> of your Lives; and all these <HI>Obligations</HI> are
<PB N="50" REF="002256_0091_0FDADDE89207D458"/>Now and always upon you, and oblige you <HI>Now</HI> as much as ever to be Devoted to God.</P>
<P>TILL you give your selves up to God, you therefore Live and <HI>Continue</HI> in the sinful <HI>Vio∣lation</HI> of them all, and a daring opposition and rebellion against Him.</P>
<P>YOU thereby dreadfully <HI>Grow</HI> in your Guilt and Wickedness, and <HI>Increase</HI> the Wrath and Curse of God upon you.</P>
<P>YOUR Early Devotion to God is necessary to <HI>Prevent and Avoid</HI> abundance of Sin and Evil; and to <HI>Obtain &amp; Do</HI> abundance of Good in the World.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Present Life</HI> is the <HI>only space</HI> or Season of giving up your selves to God.</P>
<P>AND the <HI>Time of Youth</HI> and even this very Day may be your only <HI>Opportunity.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Spring &amp; Prime of your Lives</HI> is cer∣tainly the <HI>Fittest</HI> and most suitable Season: most Easy and Pleasant for <HI>you,</HI> and most Honour∣able and Delightful to <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>Lastly,</HI> If you now Refuse to give up your selves to God, there is the greatest Dan∣ger and Likelihood that you <HI>Never will</HI> do it; but go on in your Sin, grow more averse to Religion, and dreadfully increase your Guilt in <HI>This</HI> World, and your Eternal Doom and Torment in the <HI>Other.</HI></P>
<P>FROM all these Considerations &amp; Reasons, you are indispensably <HI>Obliged</HI> both in <HI>Duty, In∣terest &amp; Wisdom, NOW</HI> immediately to Devote your selves to God <HI>in the Days of your Youth,</HI> and without any Delay.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="002256_0091_0FDADDE89207D458"/>
BUT, a Few REFLECTIONS, and then I have done. And
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>FOR those that are of a Younger Age</HI>—Oh How Great, How exceeding Great must then be Your <HI>Sin &amp; Wickedness;</HI> if after all, you re∣fuse to be Devoted to God! How exceeding great and extream is your <HI>Folly and Madness!</HI> And how inexpressibly severe will be your Fu∣ture <HI>Punishment?</HI> Oh! How many <HI>Millions</HI> of Great <HI>Obligations</HI> do you contemptuously Sin against and violate! and <HI>Every one</HI> of them is a Fearful and Higher <HI>Aggravation</HI> of your Guilt and Misery.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>FOR the Elder Ones among us</HI>—And what an Awakening Word is this to those that are of a more <HI>Advanced Age,</HI> and yet have <HI>never</HI> given up themselves to the God that has made and preserv'd them! <HI>Every Moment</HI> of your Lives, you have pro∣ceeded in the Breach of all these Great Obligations. Oh! what an inconcei∣vable Measure and <HI>Height</HI> of <HI>Iniquity</HI> are you by this time risen unto! While you have re∣fus'd to be Devoted to God, you have never done <HI>One</HI> acceptable Thing to Him in all your Lives. You have all this while been doing nothing else but continually Sinning against Him. And Oh! what dreadful Stores of Wrath have you by this time treasured up to your selves <HI>against the Day of Wrath, &amp; the Revelation of the righteous Judgments of God, who will render to Every Man according to his deeds?</HI> Rom. 2.1,—6.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>FOR us All;</HI> and so to CONCLUDE. Oh! then
<PB N="52" REF="002256_0092_0FDADDEA04312A78"/>Let us <HI>Continually Remember</HI> the many <HI>Great</HI> and <HI>Solemn Obligations</HI> we are always lying under to be Devoted to God. We are His own already by <HI>Ten thousand times ten Thousand Ob∣ligations.</HI> If we have refus'd to give up our selves to Him; we have most wickedly violated and sinn'd against them all. And Oh! How pro∣digiously vast &amp; amazing is the Sin! God Him∣self even seems to be astonished at it; in Isai. 3.2. <HI>Hear Oh Heavens and give ear O Earth: for the Lord hath spoken; I have nourished &amp; bro't up Children, and they have rebelled against me!</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>AND can there be a greater Sin, more Com∣plicate and Comprehensive, more Heinous and Provoking? And yet, Alas, there is <HI>This One</HI> greater than all; and that is your <HI>Persist∣ing</HI> therein. By Persisting in your Refusal to be Devoted to God, you do daringly <HI>Justify</HI> all your past Sins in the sight of God &amp; the World: And every Moment you <HI>Persist</HI> in your Sins; you implicitly <HI>approve</HI> them, you <HI>Repeat</HI> their Commission, and so continually <HI>Redouble</HI> the Guilt of your Sins and the weight of your Punishment.</P>
<P>OH then, Let us seriously <HI>Think</HI> upon those <HI>Awful Words</HI> in <HI>Prov.</HI> 1. <HI>from the</HI> 20 <HI>to the End:</HI> And then let us delay a moment no longer; But <HI>now Immediately</HI> give up our selves with our Hearts to God. and then Faithfully serve Him, and we shall Enjoy Him <HI>For Ever.</HI> AMEN.</P>

<HEAD>The Peculiar Advantages of <HI>Early</HI> PIETY.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By Mr. <HI>John Webb.</HI> Boston-Lecture May 3. 1721.</BYLINE>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PROVERBS VIII. 32.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye Children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT which I shall endea∣vour at this Time, by the help of God, is to set be∣fore our <HI>Young People,</HI> the <HI>peculiar</HI> Benefits and Ad∣vantages of <HI>Early</HI> Piety. You have already heard the Duty in the several great Branches of it <HI>excellently</HI> explained un∣to
<PB N="2" REF="002256_0093_0FDADDEB879D8DF0"/>you: And your Obligations unto it <HI>Strong∣ly</HI> inculcated. That therefore which offers it self next to our Consideration, is the <HI>Sin∣gular</HI> Benefits and Advantages of <HI>Remembering our great Creator in the Days of our Youth:</HI> And as this has fal'n to my Lot, I have made choice of these Words of <HI>Divine Wisdom,</HI> as an Introduction to the present Discourse. They are found among <HI>the Proverbs of Solo∣mon, the Son of David the King of Israel.</HI> And as the <HI>general</HI> Design of this book (as was excellently observed unto you the last Lec∣ture) was to <HI>form</HI> the Manners of Youth, or to <HI>Teach</HI> them betimes how to <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Serve</HI> God aright; in which their highest Wisdom and Happiness consists: So I take this to be the more <HI>particular</HI> Design of the Words now read unto you. This seems to be very evident from the <HI>manner</HI> in which they are deliver∣ed. <HI>Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye Chil∣dren: &amp;c.</HI> These Words (as I said before) are the Words of <HI>Divine Wisdom,</HI> or the Words of JESUS CHRIST, the <HI>Essential</HI> Wisdom of the Father; <HI>in whom are bid all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge, (Colos.</HI> 2.3.) and they are spoken to <HI>Children. Chiefly</HI> to Those that are Children in Years, as well as in Un∣derstanding. And they contain an <HI>earnest</HI> Ex∣hortation to the most <HI>important</HI> Duty, back't with the most <HI>forceable</HI> Motive that cou'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tho't of. The Duty you are exhorted unto is to <HI>hearken now</HI> to the voice of your Great Saviour, i. e. to learn those Lessons of <HI>Early</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="002256_0093_0FDADDEB879D8DF0"/>Piety that you have been already instructed in: And to learn them <HI>Now; to day; instantly;</HI> without making one <HI>Moments</HI> delay in this matter of infinite Concern. And the Singu∣lar Encouragement you have unto the Duty, is a most gracious Promise of <HI>Blessedness</HI> in case of Obedience, as in the Words to be in∣sisted on — <HI>For blessed are they that keep my ways.</HI> The <HI>Original</HI> Word in this place for <HI>blessed,</HI> is a most <HI>comprehensive</HI> Term; and as <HI>Criticks</HI> observe, includes all kind of Hap∣piness in it. Hence the meaning of these Words is, That all Those who <HI>hearken to the voice,</HI> or keep the Commandments of their Great God and Saviour from their Youth up, shall be every way blessed of Him. They shall be blessed with all <HI>Outward</HI> Blessings as far as is needful for them; but especially <HI>with all spiritual Blessings, in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.</HI> They shall be blessed both in their Souls and in their Bodies. They shall be blessed in <HI>this Life,</HI> at <HI>Death,</HI> and <HI>forever</HI> in the World that is to come. They shall be very <HI>remarkably</HI> blessed in all these, and such like respects. This, Children, is the glori∣ous Encouragement you have from these Words of your Saviour, to be religious now, in the Days of your Youth.</P>
<P>HENCE the Doctrine I shall insist upon from the Words is this, namely,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> ALL those who hearken to the voice of Christ,
<PB N="4" REF="002256_0094_0FDADDED22AA11B8"/>or become truly Pious and Religious in their Childhood and Youth are, and shall he h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ppy and blessed in a very <HI>peculiar</HI> and <HI>Distin∣guishing</HI> manner.</HEAD>
<P>Or more briefly thus.</P>
<P><HI>THE Early Convert has many very peculiar and distinguishing Priviledges and Advantage<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> belonging unto him.</HI></P>
<P>IN the Prosecution of my present Design I have nothing to insist upon but the Proof of this Point. And this I shall endeavour i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a very plain and familiar Enumeration of se∣veral of those blessed Privileges and Advan∣tages that are, and shall be the <HI>distinguishing</HI> Crown, and Glory, and Happiness of the <HI>Ear∣ly</HI> Convert. I say, <HI>several</HI> of these Benefits and Advantages: For it is impossible for me, or for any man living to say how many, or how great and excellent they are.</P>
<P>I shall therefore only Select some few of the most <HI>remarkable</HI> of them; and enlarge upon them as the Time will allow.</P>
<P>AND here I earnestly call upon you, the <HI>Young People</HI> of this numerous Assembly to give your present most serious and devout At∣tention. For I am now speaking unto you in the <HI>Name</HI> of the Lord; And I hope in His <HI>Fear,</HI> and with a most <HI>tender</HI> Concern for the <HI>Eternal</HI> Salvation of your <HI>precious</HI> and <HI>immor∣tal</HI> Souls. And then besides, what I have
<PB N="5" REF="002256_0094_0FDADDED22AA11B8"/>to offer unto you, may, if carefully attended into, prove <HI>Instrumental</HI> (by the Grace of God) to instill high and honourable Tho'ts of Early Religion in you; and so be an hap∣py means to perswade you to the present most <HI>delightful</HI> Exercises of it. For <HI>Happiness</HI> (no doubt) is the <HI>Mark</HI> you are aiming at. Your <HI>sprightly, vigorous,</HI> and <HI>active</HI> Powers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re in the full pursuit of such things (what∣ever they be) as you hope to reap <HI>substantial</HI> Profits and Pleasures in the Possession of. Your Tho'ts and Contrivances, your Labours and Endeavours are, that your Lives may prove a most <HI>delightful</HI> Scene unto you. And when the <HI>striving</HI> Spirit of God is at work on your <HI>tender</HI> Consciences, and you begin to en∣tertain any serious Tho'ts about your Souls and another Life, you are ready to flatter yourselves presently with the Hopes of com∣pleat Eternal Happiness in the World to come. Now I hope (by the help of Grace) to make it evident before I conclude, That <HI>a Life of true Religion entered</HI> upon, and <HI>persevered</HI> in from your Youth up, will more effectually answer all your <HI>rational</HI> and <HI>immortal</HI> Desires after Happiness than any other Methods you can propose or prosecute. There is no other Course of Life attended with so many high and honourable; with so many peculiar and distinguishing Advantages, as this is. This you'l quickly see in the process of this Dis∣course. But before I enter into the <HI>particu∣lars</HI> of this most <HI>delightful</HI> Subject, I shall, as
<PB N="6" REF="002256_0095_0FDADDEE93CB8528"/>a Foundation to all the rest, briefly observe this in General unto you, Namely,</P>
<P>BY an <HI>Early</HI> Conversion to God, you'l come <HI>early</HI> into the <HI>Covenant of His Grace;</HI> and so <HI>betimes</HI> obtain a Right and Title to all the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>invaluable</HI> Privileges that are con∣tained in it. Every Sinner from the first Mo∣ment of his true Conversion is taken into Co∣venant with God; <HI>into that Covenant of His, that is in all things well-ordered and sure.</HI> Now this Covenant comprehends all <HI>possible</HI> Bles∣sings in it. It includes all things <HI>that pertain to Life and Godliness:</HI> Every thing that i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> needful for your present Support and Com∣fort; and all that is necessary to render you compleatly and eternally Blessed in the World to come. God has graciously Promi∣sed His Covenant Servants, (and He'l be as good as His Word) <HI>that he'l give Grace and Glory; and no good thing will he withold from them.</HI> (Psal. 84.11.) This Happiness there∣fore in general, have all the Saints from the Lord: But the <HI>Early</HI> Convert enjoys it with <HI>a remarkable Emphasis.</HI> He comes <HI>first</HI> into the Possession of it, which is a <HI>Signal</HI> Favour of God unto him. And then besides, all the <HI>distinguishing</HI> Privileges of it fall to his happy Lot and Portion.</P>
<P>THIS you will plainly see, as I name the several Particulars unto you. And here in naming of them, I shall (for the help of Memory) observe this easy and most natural Distribution of them. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay,

<P N="1">1. EARLY Religion is frequently attended with many <HI>Outward</HI> Privileges and Advanta∣ges in this Life. The Apostle Paul observes unto us, (in 1 Tim. 4.8.) <HI>That Godliness is profitable to all things, having the promise of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come.</HI> And in these Words he (no doubt) re∣fers to that Promise of our Blessed Saviour in Mat. 6.33. <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you. All these things,</HI> i. e. Food and Raiment and the other necessaries and conveniencies of Life, spoken of in the pre∣ceeding Context. And tho' this <HI>Promise.</HI> of <HI>Outward</HI> Blessings as the Reward of Obedience is not (perhaps) so <HI>large</HI> and <HI>extensive</HI> in these <HI>Gospel</HI> Days, as it was under the <HI>Old Testament</HI> Dispensation: Yet we may <HI>reasona∣bly</HI> expect from hence, to be some way or o∣ther
<PB N="8" REF="002256_0096_0FDADDF00F5A4470"/>Gainers by Godliness even in Outward Regards. And the Early Convert has the fairest Prospect of any before him, to be a Gainer by it in these two Respects.</P>
<P N="1">1. BY being Religious <HI>betimes</HI> you take the most proper and direct Course you can to <HI>get</HI> and <HI>establish</HI> a good Name, Credit and Repu∣tion in the World, among all those whose <HI>Value</HI> and <HI>Esteem</HI> is worth a having. True <HI>Piety</HI> im∣parts a <HI>real</HI> Glory to those that embrace it. It inspires them with such Noble Principles and Virtues that are the distinguishing Ho∣nour and Ornament of those that have them. Hence it is the wise Man observes, <HI>That the righteous is more excellent than his neighbour.</HI> (Prov. 12.26.) And among these the <HI>Early</HI> Convert has vastly the Preheminence. Grace is <HI>beautiful</HI> in all; but it is eminently so, in such as are <HI>Godly betimes.</HI> It appears more <HI>pure</HI> and <HI>unmixed</HI> in them. For they have not so many of the <HI>Scandalous</HI> out-breakings of Sin and Corruption to <HI>Tarnish</HI> and <HI>Eclipse</HI> the Glory of it, as those that make longer Delays in Religion, usually have. It is therefore the <HI>Crown,</HI> and the <HI>Laurell</HI> of the Youth. <HI>It makes his face to shine,</HI> beyond all the Charms of the most <HI>ruddy</HI> Complexion: And is a greater Ornament unto him than the <HI>rich<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st</HI> Pearls, or the most <HI>costly</HI> Array. Hence all Those who know how to <HI>prize</HI> and <HI>value</HI> Men and Things according to their true worth, will account you, <HI>the Excellent in the Earth. Your Name, will be much set by,</HI> by all
<PB N="9" REF="002256_0096_0FDADDF00F5A4470"/>the <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> the <HI>sober</HI> and <HI>virtuous</HI> that shall have any Knowledge of You. And while the <HI>vain</HI> and <HI>extravagant</HI> Youth is the <HI>shame</HI> of his Age, and the <HI>Grief</HI> of all that have the best Interests at Heart, your <HI>godly</HI> and <HI>wise</HI> Rulers and Ministers, your <HI>pious</HI> and <HI>prudent</HI> Parents and Neighbours will look upon you with Pleasure and Delight. <HI>Such precious Sons of Zions</HI> (as you'l then be) will in their Esteem <HI>be comparable to fine gold:</HI> And they'l account you the Riches and Glory of your Country. And as they see you grow up and improve in Grace and Virtue, they'l look up∣on you as the hope of future Time; and so be able to dye with the greater Comfort in the Prospect of being succeeded by such as are like to do worthily in their Day and Gene∣ration. This is the Honour you'l have from the Saints. And then, as to the rest of Mankind, tho' their Credit &amp; Esteem is not so much to be regarded; yet such of them as have any of the <HI>Remains</HI> of Morality in them can't but <HI>re∣verence</HI> that <HI>Sobriety, Temperance, Wisdom, Pru∣dence, Justice, Meekness,</HI> &amp;c. that will adorn your Conversation in the World. And even the most <HI>profligate</HI> Wretches upon Earth, that are <HI>lost</HI> not only to <HI>Religion;</HI> but even to <HI>Mo∣ral</HI> Honesty it self; and that are ready upon all other Occasions to express their <HI>Hatred</HI> against you and the ways of Godliness; will yet (if they have any <HI>important</HI> affair to ma∣nage, that requires the Exercise of <HI>Moral</HI> vir∣tues, such as <HI>Prudence, Justice, Integnity, Fide∣lity</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002256_0097_0FDADDF583119D30"/>&amp;c. in those they Trust it with;) I say, They will sooner commit it into your Hands then into the Hands of their <HI>merry</HI> Compa∣nions that are <HI>equally</HI> vicious with them∣selves. And this is a plain Evidence that undisguised Virtue commands secret Respect wherever it appears. — And thus <HI>good under∣standing giveth favour in the eyes of men,</HI> Prov. 13.15. Now such an <HI>established</HI> Reputation in the World is the greatest of all <HI>Outward</HI> Advantages. It will put many an Opportuni∣ty into your Hands to <HI>Do</HI> and <HI>Enjoy</HI> good here which otherwise you'l certainly <HI>miss</HI> of. And hence it is Solomon truly observes unto us. Prov. 22.1. <HI>A good name is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ther to be chosen than great riches, and loving favour ra∣ther than silver and gold.</HI> But then,</P>
<P N="2">2. THOSE that are Virtuous <HI>betimes</HI> have the most <HI>rational</HI> Prospects before them of coming to the Possession and Enjoyment of a <HI>sufficiency</HI> of the good Things of this Life. There is not only a <HI>Moral</HI> but <HI>Natural</HI> Ten∣dency, in the Exercise of many <HI>Christian</HI> vir∣tues, to get and secure to ourselves, as much of this World as our State and Circumstan∣ces in it may call for. Solomon observes un∣to us in Prov. 10.4. <HI>That the hand of the dili∣gent maketh rich; while he that dealeth with a slack hand becometh poor.</HI> And then by mode∣rate Expences, Temperance, Frugality, and the like, the <HI>Virtuous</HI> Man keeps what the <HI>Idle Spend-thrif<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> prodigally throws away. Hence then, as <HI>length of Days, are said to be in
<PB N="11" REF="002256_0097_0FDADDF583119D30"/>the right hand of wisdom; so are Riches and Honour</HI> said <HI>to be in her left hand.</HI> (Prov. 3.16.) But suppose the <HI>Covetous</HI> Worldling should by his <HI>extream</HI> Parsimony, or by <HI>sparing more than is mete,</HI> by Rapine and Theft, by Bribery, Extortion, Cheating, and the like evil Courses, amass to himself a larger Pos∣session then you are ever like to come <HI>fairly</HI> at: Yet herein you'l (undoubtedly) have the Advantage of him. viz.</P>
<P>YOU'l have a better <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Title</HI> to the Little you <HI>lawfully</HI> possess. You'l not only have a <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Civil</HI> Title unto it (which is more then the <HI>cheating</HI> Miser has:) But you'l have a <HI>Covenant</HI> Right and Title unto it which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> more than any <HI>wicked</HI> Man has to the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his Enjoyments. <HI>For Godliness</HI> (as I said before) <HI>has the Promise of the Life that now is, as well as of that which is to come.</HI> (1 Tim. 4.8.) And as you'l have the best Title to what you possess. So,</P>
<P>YOUR <HI>Enjoyment,</HI> which is the End of Possession, will (in all Probability) be more <HI>sweet</HI> and <HI>pleasant.</HI> You wont have those stings of Conscience, which usually attend an <HI>ill</HI> gotten Estate, and a <HI>guilty</HI> Mind, to eat out the Comfort of what you have. And then besides, 'Tis likely you may be favoured with a more <HI>healthly</HI> Constitution, which is the very soul of all Outward Enjoyment. For <HI>Temperance,</HI> and <HI>Frugality</HI> are Friends to to the Health of the Body; while <HI>Intempe∣rance, Unchastity,</HI> beastly <HI>Sensuality, Luxury,</HI> &amp;c.
<PB N="12" REF="002256_0098_0FDADDF6E335E2B0"/>disorder the Frame of Nature, corrupt the Juices of the Body, consume the Flesh, wast the Spirits, breed loathsome Diseases, — and so either cut short the Days, or fill them up with pain and anguish. And to these I shall add,</P>
<P>THE Religous Man has the <HI>peculiar</HI> Blessing of God upon all his <HI>Outward</HI> Possessions whe∣ther more or less: So that if there be any thing <HI>real</HI> to be enjoyed in them, the Saint shall have the Comfort of them if God s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it to be best for him. And hence the Ps<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> mist assures us in Psal. 37.16. <HI>A little that, righteous man hath is better then the riche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> many wicked.</HI> But after all, suppose y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> should be reduced to the <HI>lowest</HI> Circumstances in the World, and have nothing that you ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> call your own in it (as it must be confessed, has sometimes been the case with very emi∣nent Saints; and hence we read of such as and <HI>poor in this world, but rich in faith,</HI> Jam. 2.5.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> I say, suppose this shou'd be your case; yet by being strictly religious you'l find your ac∣count even in this Life. God will give you <HI>Contentment</HI> with your Outward State and Condition. And he that is contented in this reaps the <HI>proper</HI> fruit of Possession: And <HI>En∣joys</HI> himself with far more ease and freedom, tho' he lye with <HI>Lazarus</HI> at the Gate, than a wicked <HI>Dives</HI> can do, in his <HI>rich Apparel, far∣ing Sumptuously every Day.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus, Children, you see, that even in <HI>Outward</HI> Respects, the <HI>Early</HI> Convert has the
<PB N="13" REF="002256_0098_0FDADDF6E335E2B0"/>most <HI>rational</HI> Prospects before him, of being the Happiest Man; even in this Life and World. And I have the rather enlarged up∣on this Head, because One great <HI>Objection</HI> which <HI>Young</HI> People have against Early Piety, is a groundless Conceit that as soon as ever they become truly <HI>Pious</HI> and <HI>Virtuous</HI> they must <HI>instantly</HI> abandon all that is pleasant in this World: Whereas if you will but <HI>impar∣nally</HI> consider what has been said it may have to convince you that the Early Convert takes the most <HI>proper</HI> and <HI>Rational</HI> Course of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y to lead a quiet, and peaceable, and happy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se, even in this World. But now these <HI>Outward</HI> Advantages are the least article in the Saints Inventory. There are <HI>innumerable</HI> other Privileges and Advantages you'l obtain a Title unto by the <HI>Early</HI> Dedication of your selves unto God, the least of which (if laid in the Balance) would weigh down this whole World, with all that is desireable in it. And these are the Benefits I shall now direct my tho'ts unto. Hence,</P>
<P N="2">II. EARLY Religion is attended with ma∣ny <HI>peculiar Spiritual</HI> Privileges and Advanta∣ges in this Life. All such as Devote and give up Themselves to God in their Child∣hood and Youth, shall from this Time forward be invested <HI>with all Spiritual Blessings in hea∣venly places in Christ Jesus.</HI> To instance here in some few of these <HI>inestimable</HI> distinguish∣ing Privileges.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="002256_0099_0FDADE128AEBBEF0"/>
1. THE <HI>Early</HI> Convert is blest with an <HI>Ear∣ly Adoption</HI> into the Number of GOD's Chil∣dren. Every one that is Renewed and Sanc∣tifyed by the Spirit of God, immediately be∣comes a Son, a Child of GOD by a most <HI>graci∣ous</HI> Adoption, John 1.12. <HI>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</HI> Hence Those that are <HI>first</HI> Converted unto God, have the <HI>peculiar</HI> Honour to be <HI>first</HI> invested with this Privilege. And how great the Dignity and Advantage of this is will appear if we briefly consider what it is to <HI>become</HI> a Child of God; and what <HI>distinguish∣ing</HI> Privileges such are Favoured withal.</P>
<P>AND here briefly;</P>
<P>TO become a Child of GOD is to be taken into the <HI>nearest</HI> Relation to God that any Creature is capable of. The most <HI>glorious</HI> An∣gels in Heaven have no higher Title than to be called <HI>the sons of God.</HI> (Job 38.7.) Nay to be called <HI>the son of God</HI> in an <HI>appropriate</HI> sense: i. e. to be <HI>the only begotten Son of God — His well beloved Son — the Son of His Love, &amp;c.</HI> is the most <HI>intimate</HI> and <HI>exalted</HI> Relation that the <HI>Second Person</HI> in the Ever-Blessed Trinity stands in unto <HI>God the Father.</HI> How amazing then is the infinite Condescention of the Great God towards such <HI>sinful, polluted</HI> Worms of the Dust as we are, that He should Advance us to the <HI>Dignity</HI> of Children by a gracious Adoption! It is an Ho∣nour done us, that <HI>simply</HI> considered, is in∣finitely
<PB N="15" REF="002256_0099_0FDADE128AEBBEF0"/>greater than if we had been born of a <HI>David,</HI> of a <HI>Solomon,</HI> or of any of the most <HI>Splendid</HI> Monarchs that ever sway'd a Scepter in this World.</P>
<P>AGAIN, To become a Child of God is to be <HI>made like unto God.</HI> By a gracious Adop∣tion you'l have the <HI>Image of the Heavenly A∣dam</HI> livelily <HI>enstampt upon you,</HI> (1 Cor. 15.49.) That Image of His, <HI>which consisteth in righte∣ousness and true holiness,</HI> (Eph. 4.24.) This Image you'l <HI>be changed into from Glory to God, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</HI> 'till at length you shall <HI>perfectly be transformed into His Like∣ness,</HI> as far as your Nature and Capacity will allow of, (1 Cor. 3.18. 1 John 3.2. compa∣red.) And how glorious is the Dignity of this! To bare a Resemblance to <HI>earthly</HI> Ma∣jesty makes a <HI>splendid</HI> appearance in the Eye of the World. But <HI>unspeakably</HI> more glori∣ous in the Eyes of GOD, Angels and good Men is the least Saint, <HI>being made a partaker of the Divine Nature,</HI> (2 Pet. 1.4.)</P>
<P>AND then besides, To become a Child of God, is to be enabled to live <HI>a Life of God</HI> in this world. Those that are the Children of God are the <HI>Followers</HI> of their Great God and Saviour; and imitate Him in all His <HI>imitable</HI> Perfections. (See <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.1.) And this is the most noble and divine Life that can pos∣sibly be led by us. For as God is the <HI>Origi∣nal</HI> of all Excellency and Perfection; so a Conformity to His blessed Image and Exam∣ple will exceedingly refine our Nature, and
<PB N="16" REF="002256_0100_0FDAC97D58645E98"/>vastly exalt us above the common Level of Mankind. Thus you see what it is to be∣come a Child of God: And how <HI>honourable</HI> the Relation is.</P>
<P>AND now the <HI>distinguishing</HI> Privileges of it are no less <HI>wonderful</HI> and <HI>glorious.</HI> For by being a Child of God, You have His <HI>Fatherly</HI> Compassions always extended towards you. Psal. 103.13. <HI>Like as a Father pitieth his Chil∣dren; so does the Lord pity them that fear him.</HI> His <HI>watchful</HI> Eye will ever be upon you, His <HI>tender</HI> Care over you, and His <HI>bountiful</HI> Hand open unto you. And then besides, You may <HI>repair</HI> unto Him at all Times <HI>as Children to their Father.</HI> You may make Him your Re∣fuge in every Time of Trouble: You may o∣pen all your wants and Griefs unto Him: You may cast all your Burdens upon Him: And beg all needful supplies from Him. All this you may do with the Liberty and Free∣dom of Children; And be assured, That His Ear will <HI>ever</HI> be <HI>open</HI> to your Requests. For <HI>the Eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his Ears are open to their Cry,</HI> (as in Psal. 34.15.) And to these I shall add, By virtue of your Adoption you'l obtain an <HI>unalienable</HI> Right and Title to <HI>the Inheritance of Children — An heavenly Inheritance — the Inheri∣tance of the Saints in Light.</HI> And that which will be the <HI>crown</HI> and <HI>glory</HI> of all is, you'l be made a <HI>joynt Heir with Christ</HI> of this Inheri∣tance. Rom. 8.16, 17. <HI>The Spirit it self bar∣eth witness with ours, that we are the Children
<PB N="17" REF="002256_0100_0FDAC97D58645E98"/>of God. And if Children then Heirs; Heirs of God, and joynt Heirs with Christ.</HI> These Things I have but just named unto you. But however by these hints you see what the <HI>Dig∣nity</HI> and <HI>Benefit</HI> of Adoption is. Well then might the Apostle <HI>John</HI> break forth into those Admiring Expressions, at the Consideration of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, 1 John 3.1. <HI>Behold! what manner of Love <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> called the sons of God.</HI> And now, Dear Children, By an <HI>Early</HI> Conversion to God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou'l not only obtain this blessed <HI>Privilege</HI> of adoption; but you will have the <HI>Honour</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e the <HI>first</HI> in it — The first of your Age and Day —. Your <HI>Early Conformity to the Image of your Dear Saviour,</HI> will make you the <HI>first-born</HI> among your Brethren and Companions. Now the <HI>Birth-right</HI> has ever been accounted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Singular</HI> Privilege. <HI>The Excellency of Dig∣nity</HI> belongs unto it. And the <HI>first-born</HI> have <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sually</HI> had <HI>distinguishing</HI> Honours conferred upon them. And in particular it has been Customary for the Father of the Family to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive a double Portion to the <HI>eldest</HI> Son in it. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd after this manner will your heavenly Fa∣ther honour the <HI>Early</HI> Convert at last; as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ou may hear before I conclude the Discourse.</P>
<P N="2">2. BY an <HI>Early</HI> Conversion to God you'l be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e <HI>first</HI> in obtaining <HI>Pardon, Peace</HI> and <HI>Recon∣ciliation</HI> with God <HI>in</HI> and <HI>thro'</HI> Christ. A Per∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> is no sooner <HI>Converted from the Error of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ways to the wisdom of the Just,</HI> but he ob∣tains
<PB N="18" REF="002256_0101_0FDADDF8550A2B60"/>the <HI>free</HI> Remission of all his Iniquities. The Debt that he owed to Divine Justice is now paid, his Bonds cancelled, and an <HI>Act</HI> of Indemnity past upon him. Hence you read in, Rom. 8.1. <HI>There is therefore now no Condem∣nation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit.</HI> And be∣ing thus justifyed from the <HI>Guilt</HI> of all his Sins, he obtains <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Reconciliation</HI> with God. His former Enmity against God is <HI>no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> in a great Measure removed, and Gods Anger turned away from him. And therefore from hence forward, We hear the blessed <HI>Procla∣mation</HI> of Peace between them as in, Rom. 5.1. <HI>Therefore being justifyed by Faith we have Peace with God.</HI> And this Peace is bro't a∣bout and Concluded only <HI>in</HI> and <HI>thro'</HI> the Lord Jesus Christ; as in the place but now mentioned. And hence it is Christ is called <HI>our Peace,</HI> (Eph. 2.14.) And we are said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>obtain forgiveness thro' his blood according <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Riches of his Grace,</HI> (Eph. 1.7.) <HI>and t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> he reconciled by his Death,</HI> (Colos. 1.21, 22. And now this <HI>Pardon, Peace,</HI> and <HI>Reconciliati∣on</HI> is an <HI>unspeakable</HI> Privilege to all that a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> in the happy Possession of it. This will ap∣pear, if you do but consider on the one han<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what a <HI>dreadful</HI> Thing it is, to lye under th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Guilt of all your Sins, and so both to be a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Enemy</HI> to God, and to have Him for your <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣censed</HI> Adversary. Every such Sinner is <Q>un∣der the Wrath and Curse of God; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> made liable to all Miseries in this Life, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="19" REF="002256_0101_0FDADDF8550A2B60"/>Death it self, and to the Pains of Hell for ever.</Q> He is liable to <HI>Vindictive</HI> Horrors of Conscience in this World, and to <HI>endless, in∣supportable</HI> Vengeance in the World to come. And so on the other hand, the greatness of this Privilege will appear, if you do but con∣sider, what the <HI>happy</HI> Effects of <HI>Pardon</HI> and and <HI>Reconciliation</HI> with God are. These are Peace in a Mans own Conscience; an Interest in <HI>the Favour of God which is better than Life;</HI> and a sure Title to eternal Salvation. Hence the <HI>Pardon</HI> of Sin has obtain'd the name <HI>Re∣demption, Eph.</HI> 1.7. And hence it is the <HI>Par∣doned</HI> Man is expresly called <HI>a blessed Man,</HI> Psal. 32.1, 2. <HI>Blessed is he whose Transgression is forgiven, whose Sin is covered. Blessed is the man unto whom the Lord imputeth not Iniquity, and in whose Spirit there is no guile.</HI> And now, Children, since Pardon, Peace and Re∣conciliation with God, are such a blessed Ad∣vantage to all that have an Interest in them, it must needs be an <HI>Additional</HI> Privilege to come <HI>Early</HI> into the Possession of them. By this means, you'l enjoy more of the <HI>happy</HI> fruits of them, and for a <HI>longer</HI> Time than others. You will have your Pardon to show, while other Vain Youth carry about their Chains of Guilt with them. You'l be able to call God your <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Friend,</HI> while they can't but look upon Him as their <HI>Enemy</HI> and <HI>Avenger.</HI> Your Title to Heaven will be se∣cure, while <HI>their</HI> Title is to seek. And while <HI>They</HI> hang over the Lake that burns
<PB N="20" REF="002256_0102_0FDADDF9C5291350"/>with Fire and Brimstone, by the <HI>slender</HI> threat of Life only, <HI>you</HI> will have a Crown of Glory i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reserve for you. And in a word, there is nothing now but this <HI>momentany</HI> Life that can stand be∣tween you and the perfection of Happiness And now judge how great this Privilege of <HI>Early</HI> Conversion is.</P>
<P N="3">3. ANOTHER <HI>present</HI> Advantage of an <HI>Early</HI> Dedication to God is this, You'l hereby escape innumerable Sins, Snares, Temptations, and Sorrows, that others unavoidably involve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves in. You all of you know, <HI>That Childhood and Youth are said to be vanity,</HI> Eccl. 11.10. There is <HI>no</HI> Age of Mankind more prone to Sin, or shew more of <HI>sinful</HI> Levity than Youth: Nor is there any Age encom∣passed with more ensnaring Temptations than this Age. And therefore, when the <HI>Young Man</HI> gives loose to his Corruptions, <HI>and walks i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the ways of his heart, and in the sight of his ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> eyes,</HI> you see what <HI>fearful</HI> work he quickly makes of it. He runs into the way of every Temptation, and his Feet are presently en∣tangled in the Snares that Satan lays for him. He has no Bridle upon his Lusts, and therefore <HI>gives himself over unto Lasciviousness, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> work all uncleanness with greediness.</HI> Hence there is no Sin so <HI>Infamous,</HI> so <HI>Vile,</HI> or <HI>Dis∣graceful,</HI> but you may oft-times behold the <HI>Young Man void of understanding, Vigorous</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the pursuit and practice of it. And by this Means he <HI>many times</HI> brings a <HI>blot</HI> upon hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Name which he can never wipe off in this
<PB N="21" REF="002256_0102_0FDADDF9C5291350"/>World: And, <HI>always dreadfully dishonours</HI> the Name of God, <HI>grieves</HI> his <HI>Pious</HI> Parents and Friends, and makes the most <HI>amazing</HI> work for an after Repentance. And therefore if ever the <HI>profligate</HI> Wretch be brought to a <HI>true</HI> sense of the evil of his ways, and so obtains the mercy of God after he has wasted away the best of his Days in Sin and Vanity; his Repentance is <HI>usually</HI> attended with <HI>unspeak∣ably</HI> more Grief, and Sorrow and Anguish of Soul. His <HI>bones are broken,</HI> and heart <HI>deeply</HI> wounded with the Sins of his Youth. And these make him to go Mourning and Limping to his Grave. But now an <HI>Early</HI> Conver∣sion to God, will (by divine Grace) prove a most effectual Remedy against all these Evils. It will fill you <HI>betimes</HI> with <HI>Hatred</HI> of Sin; It will make you <HI>watchful</HI> against Temptations unto it: And when you are assaulted by them it will enable you to say with that gracious and renowned Young Man, <HI>How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God?</HI> (Gen. 39.9.) And thus by escaping the Sins of Youth you'l prevent the doleful Sorrows and Agonies of an after Repentance for them. And Now this Advantage, tho' a <HI>negative</HI> one only, is worth more than all the <HI>positive</HI> Blessings this World can afford. And it is the <HI>Singular</HI> Happiness of an <HI>Early, Serious,</HI> and <HI>Devout</HI> Dedication to God.</P>
<P N="4">4. BY entering <HI>betimes</HI> into the Service of God you will find the Duties of Religion more <HI>easy, sweet,</HI> and <HI>delightful</HI> unto you, than other∣wise
<PB N="22" REF="002256_0103_0FDADDFB53064128"/>you'l (probably) <HI>ever</HI> find them to be. There is (indeed) a great deal of <HI>Labour,</HI> and <HI>Pains,</HI> and <HI>Cost</HI> to be expended in a Life of Religion. Many of the Duties of it are attended with uncommon Difficulty. They are directly contrary to <HI>Flesh</HI> and <HI>Blood.</HI> And there is nothing our <HI>Corrupt Nature</HI> more re∣luctates at, than at the tho'ts of them. Such are the Duties of <HI>Self-denial, of bearing the Cross,</HI> of <HI>forgiving</HI> and <HI>loving</HI> our Enemies, and the like. Hence it is the way to Heaven is compared <HI>to a strait gate, and a narrow way.</HI> And hence it is, we are called upon <HI>to strive,</HI> even to Agony, <HI>that we may enter</HI> in at it, (<HI>Luk.</HI> 13.24.) But however, the Service is not so difficult, but there is a real Pleasure and Delight to be met withal in it. The Work many times carries its own Wages in it. Hence the <HI>Psalmist</HI> observes, <HI>That in keep∣ing God's Commands there is a great Reward,</HI> Psal. 19.11. Now the <HI>Early</HI> Convert bids the fairest of any for this Reward in Duty. For as he that sets out <HI>late</HI> in the Service of God; and begins his work either at the <HI>Sixth</HI> or <HI>Ninth</HI> or <HI>Eleventh</HI> Hour, has a great deal <HI>more</HI> Work to do, and <HI>less</HI> time to do it in: more <HI>numerous</HI> and <HI>powerful</HI> Lusts to subdue, and <HI>less</HI> measures of Grace to make head a∣gainst them: so it is <HI>frequently</HI> seen that such drive on more <HI>heavily</HI> in their Work than o∣thers. The Service of God which should be their Delight is too much a <HI>toil</HI> and a <HI>burden</HI> unto them.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="002256_0103_0FDADDFB53064128"/>
BUT now as to the <HI>Early</HI> Convert, he loses <HI>comparatively</HI> but little of his Time. He be∣gins his Work in the <HI>Morning</HI> of his Day. And by a diligent Prosecution of it he <HI>inures</HI> himself to the Service of Christ. And this (by the Grace of God) renders <HI>the Yoke of Christ easy and his burden light unto him.</HI> Custom in Duty <HI>habituates</HI> it unto Him. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what is <HI>habitual</HI> is <HI>easy</HI> and <HI>pleasant</HI> unto us. Hence he that sets out first in the Service of God usually <HI>runs the ways of God's Commands with a more enlarged heart. He finds the ways of Wisdom to be ways of plesantness, and all her paths to be peace.</HI> He takes <HI>inexpressible</HI> De∣light in the most <HI>difficult</HI> Duties of Christia∣nity; and can deny himself, <HI>take up the Cross, forgive an Enemy,</HI> and the like, with greater Cheerfulness, than others are wont to gratify their <HI>sensual</HI> Desires and Appetites withal. In a word, by a long course of Obedience to the Commandments, it will <HI>become your Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and Drink, to do the will of your heavenly Father.</HI> And now, Children, This is an Advantage highly worth a seeking after, and will un∣speakably more than recompence your <HI>Early.</HI> Diligence in the Work of your Lord.</P>
<P N="5">5. THE <HI>Early</HI> Convert is like to make the <HI>richest</HI> Improvements in Grace and Holiness. As <HI>Natural</HI> Habits are confirmed and strength∣ned by <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epeated</HI> Acts; so are the <HI>gracious</HI> Ha∣bits of a <HI>Sanctified</HI> Mind. Hence the sooner you begin the Exercise of Grace, the more
<PB N="24" REF="002256_0104_0FDADDFCE20F4CA0"/>time you are like to improve in it. And if you are but <HI>industrious</HI> in this Improvement you'l quickly find that as your Days are <HI>Mul∣tiply'd</HI> your Graces will be upon the <HI>thriving</HI> hand. They will every Day grow more <HI>lively,</HI> and <HI>vigorous</HI> and <HI>active</HI> in you. You will hereby obtain a more <HI>compleat</HI> and <HI>entire</HI> victory over your <HI>unruly</HI> Lusts and Corrupti∣ons. The longer you maintain the War a∣gainst them (provided you are vigilant and re∣solute in it) the less head will they be able to make against you, and the less Disturbance will you meet withal from them. By a <HI>con∣stant</HI> levelling at the <HI>Root</HI> of Sin, the <HI>Habits</HI> of it will by degrees grow weaker and weaker in you. And hence many that at their first setting out in the ways of God, have found their wicked Lusts and Passions very <HI>exorbi∣tant</HI> and <HI>unruly,</HI> have (by the Grace of God) in continuance of time brought them into very great subjection. Their <HI>towering</HI> Pride has been <HI>battered</HI> down into the <HI>lowest</HI> Humi∣lity: their <HI>raging</HI> Anger, that was won't <HI>furiously</HI> to break bounds upon every <HI>frivilous</HI> Occasion, has been softened down into a <HI>Dove∣like</HI> Meekness: and this under the highest <HI>personal</HI> Affronts: their <HI>revengeful</HI> Spirit has been <HI>melted</HI> down into the most <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>be∣nevolent</HI> temper: and their <HI>selfish</HI> Disposition <HI>changed</HI> into the most <HI>self-denying</HI> frame. And so with respect to every other <HI>vile</HI> Lust and Affection. And then as to <HI>the several Graces of the Spirit</HI> (which are <HI>comparatively</HI> but
<PB N="25" REF="002256_0104_0FDADDFCE20F4CA0"/>weak and feeble at the Sinners first Conver∣sion) these by <HI>long</HI> Experience and Diligence in the Work and Service of God do exceed∣ingly grow and improve, strengthen and in∣crease themselves. Your <HI>Faith</HI> which at first appears but weak and tottering, and ready to fail upon every new Difficulty or Tempta∣tion, will by long experience and exercise grow more <HI>fixed</HI> and <HI>steady,</HI> more <HI>uniform</HI> and <HI>lively</HI> in exerting it self upon the <HI>proper</HI> Ob∣jects of it; and so <HI>upon Trial will be found unto praise and honour and glory: As Abraham by being strong in Faith gave Glory to God.</HI> Your <HI>slender</HI> hopes will by the same means <HI>strengthen</HI> and <HI>increase,</HI> and become as <HI>an An∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ther sure and stedfast cast within the vail.</HI> Also your Love to, and Delight in God and Christ, and the things of His Kingdom will <HI>enkindle</HI> into an <HI>holy</HI> same, and become more <HI>vigorous</HI> and <HI>active</HI> by a <HI>frequent</HI> Meditation upon those Glorious Objects, and by the larger Experience you will have of the Divine Goodness unto you. Your <HI>filial</HI> Fear and Re∣verence of God will increase by your more <HI>frequent</HI> and <HI>near</HI> approach to His most <HI>awful Sacred Majesty.</HI> Your <HI>Submissions</HI> to the Di∣vine Will, the <HI>oftner</HI> they are made, the more <HI>lowly</HI> and <HI>entire</HI> will they prove. Your Pati∣ence by <HI>frequent</HI> Exercise under Trials, will at length come to have <HI>its perfect work.—</HI> And so may it be said of every other Grace. The more time you improve, and the oftner you are in the Exercise of it, the more will
<PB N="26" REF="002256_0105_0FDADE020F330978"/>you <HI>strengthen the Habit,</HI> and <HI>invigorate the several actings of it.</HI> And thus (if God spare your lives any considerable time in this World,) you are like to be the <HI>greatest</HI> proficients in the School of Christ, to make the <HI>largest</HI> Im∣provements in Grace and Holiness, and by this means to <HI>grow up to strong men in Christ Jesus,</HI> while others that set out later in the Day will remain but <HI>Babes in Christ,</HI> in com∣pare with you. And this is another <HI>singular</HI> Privilege of <HI>Early</HI> Conversion, and a mighty Encouragement unto it. And as a necessary consequent upon this,</P>
<P N="6">6. THE <HI>sooner</HI> you begin in the Service of God, the more Work you are like to do for Him; and so bring the <HI>greater Revenue</HI> of Glory to His Name. The Glory of God is the great End for which we were all made. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ince this was the principal End of your Be∣ing, it must needs be your highest Wisdom, Perfection and Happiness to answer it in the best manner you can. For the Glory of any Creature is to answer the <HI>Original</HI> Design of it. Now the most <HI>effectual</HI> course you can take in order to this, is to begin <HI>Early</HI> in the Service of God, and to <HI>persevere</HI> with Diligence in it. For observe, if you do but <HI>Devote</HI> your selves to God in your <HI>Childhood</HI> and <HI>Youth,</HI> God will put many Opportunities into your hands to serve Him, which He won't favour others withal; and He will help you to improve many more which <HI>vain</HI> Youth <HI>forever</HI> carelesly let slip. And by this means
<PB N="27" REF="002256_0105_0FDADE020F330978"/>you'l become <HI>Plants of Renown</HI> in the Vine∣yard of God: And the longer He spares you in it, the more <HI>of the precious Fruits of Righ∣teousness will you bring forth, which are by Jesus Christ to the Praise and Glory of God.</HI> And what a <HI>Distinguishing</HI> Crown of Honour will this be upon your Heads? It will ren∣der you <HI>lovely</HI> and <HI>desirable</HI> in the Eyes of your Great God and Saviour. Hence,</P>
<P N="7">7. Lastly, BY <HI>setting</HI> out <HI>Early</HI> in the Service of God you'l experience more of the <HI>Special</HI> Favour of God, and of the <HI>Substantial</HI> Comforts of true Religion while you live. The <HI>Early</HI> Convert is the <HI>Darling</HI> Child in the Kingdom of Grace God has indeed an <HI>astonishing</HI> Love for all that are <HI>Conformed</HI> in any good Degree, <HI>to the Image of His Son:</HI> but He seems to have a very <HI>peculiar distin∣guishing</HI> Affection for all those that seek and serve Him from their Youth up. This is plainly intimated unto us in those words of Divine Wisdom, (Prov. 8.17.) <HI>I love them that love me, and those that seek me early shall find me.</HI> And then besides, our blessed Redeemer gave no small proof of it, when He fixed up∣on <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Youngest</HI> of all His D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iples, as His <HI>beloved Disciple,</HI> (See <HI>Joh.</HI> 21.7, 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.) And as the <HI>Early</HI> Convert is a <HI>favourite</HI> Child of God; so (no doubt) God will make more <HI>sig∣nal</HI> discoveries of His <HI>Fatherly</HI> Affection unto him. Your Great Saviour (if you seek Him <HI>betimes</HI>) will suffer you with <HI>John to lean up∣on his Bosom,</HI> while others shall be honour∣ed
<PB N="28" REF="002256_0106_0FDADE038AD1E5C0"/>only with the Privilege of <HI>sitting</HI> at the Table with Him. He will take you more <HI>frequently</HI> into the Chambers of His Delight; and shew you more of the Riches and Honours of His Kingdom. He will give you <HI>greater</HI> quiet and tranquility in your own Minds; and a more established Peace in your Consci∣ences. He will <HI>multiply</HI> the comforts of the Holy Ghost unto you; and so <HI>Anoint you with the oyl of joy and gladness above your fellows.</HI> And hence you'l <HI>sit under the shadow of your Saviour with greater delight; and his fruit will be sweeter to your taste.</HI> You will enjoy <HI>abun∣dant</HI> more of it, and for a longer season than others. In a Word, By your <HI>Early Devoting</HI> your selves to the <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Service</HI> of God, you will make <HI>wonderful</HI> Improvements in a Life of <HI>Communion</HI> with God, and so reap the <HI>first Fruits</HI> of the <HI>Heavenly</HI> Canaan in greater plenty while you are here in the Wilderness. below. And now, dear Children, what a <HI>Glorious</HI> Privilege is this? Don't you account it your Honour and Happiness to be the <HI>Dar∣lings</HI> of your <HI>Earthly</HI> Parents? Is not a <HI>spe∣cial</HI> Interest in their Love, and their <HI>constant</HI> Smiles upon you reckoned among the greatest of your Earthly Comforts? They are certainly thus <HI>esteemed</HI> by every <HI>dutiful</HI> and <HI>obedient</HI> Child. But what is all this to an Interest in the more <HI>peculiar</HI> Love of God, and the more <HI>abundant</HI> Joys of the Holy Ghost? Is not one <HI>Smile</HI> from our Heavenly Father infinitely more to the <HI>pious</HI> Soul than all the
<PB N="29" REF="002256_0106_0FDADE038AD1E5C0"/>Happiness this World can afford? How <HI>trans∣cendent</HI> then is the Dignity and Happiness of being His <HI>Favourite</HI> Children? And thus upon the whole, you may plainly see, That a Life <HI>spent</HI> in the Service of God is the most <HI>profitable</HI> and <HI>pleasant</HI> Life in the whole World. And consequently that those who <HI>begin</HI> and <HI>end</HI> the Day of Life with God, make the <HI>best</HI> and <HI>wisest</HI> Provision for themselves in time, as well as to all Eternity. And thus I have past thro' the <HI>First</HI> general Head under the Doctrine; and considered several of the spe∣cial Benefits and Advantages of Early Religion in this <HI>present evil</HI> Life and World.</P>
<P N="2">II. I proceed now more <HI>briefly</HI> to shew, What the <HI>Singular</HI> Advantages of it are like to be in a <HI>Dying Hour.</HI> Death you are sensi∣ble is <HI>Advancing</HI> apace towards us all: To∣wards <HI>those</HI> of you that are in your <HI>Childhood</HI> and <HI>Youth,</HI> as well as towards those that are of <HI>riper</HI> Years. We read in, Gen. 3.19. <HI>Dust thou art and unto Dust shalt thou return.</HI> And according to this Decree, the Apostle asserts (in Heb. 9.27.) <HI>It is appointed unto men once to dye —. What man therefore is he, that liv∣eth, and shall not see Death?</HI> And since Death is thus <HI>unavoidable,</HI> and is attended, at the same time, with the utmost of natural Hor∣rors: (As every one knows that has had any <HI>realizing</HI> Apprehensions concerning it.) I say since it is thus, it must needs be a point of the <HI>highest</HI> Wisdom in us to think <HI>seriously</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="002256_0107_0FDADE05095E7FA0"/>of the <HI>Evil Day</HI> before it comes: And to make the <HI>speediest</HI> and <HI>best</HI> Provision against it that we can: That so when we come to Encounter Death, The <HI>Prospect</HI> of it may not <HI>Affright</HI> us into Everlasting Horror and Des∣pair. Now the most proper Course you can possibly take, not only to prevent this <HI>An∣guish</HI> and <HI>Distress</HI> in your Conflict with Death: But also to overcome the Fears of it, and so be able to <HI>meet</HI> and <HI>embrace</HI> it, as an absent Child wou'd do, the <HI>Messenger</HI> that was sent to Conduct him to his <HI>Fathers</HI> House, is to begin a Life of Religion <HI>Now</HI> while you are in the <HI>Morning</HI> and <HI>Flower</HI> of <HI>Youth.</HI> For be∣sides a <HI>constant habitual</HI> preparation for Death, which is an <HI>unspeakable</HI> Privilege, you'l en∣joy all your Days, you will <HI>reap</HI> these <HI>special</HI> Benefits by it, when you come to meet <HI>the King of Terrors,</HI> and to look Death steadily in the Face.</P>
<P N="1">1. YOU will be <HI>able</HI> to <HI>Reflect</HI> and <HI>Look back</HI> with greater Comfort upon your <HI>past</HI> Life and Conversation in the World than <HI>o∣therwise</HI> you would do; or than <HI>many other</HI> dying Saints are <HI>enabled</HI> to do. You will not have <HI>the Sins of Youth:</HI> At most you will not have <HI>so many</HI> of them to come to your Re∣membrance, and Distress you in a Dying Hour, as otherwise you will have. For do but consider, How is it possible, that a poor <HI>Prodigal</HI> that returns to God after he has con∣sumed the <HI>biggest part</HI> of his <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Talents</HI> in the Service of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Satan,</HI> should find
<PB N="31" REF="002256_0107_0FDADE05095E7FA0"/>his <HI>Account</HI> in the midst of the <HI>Agonies</HI> of Death, as the <HI>Early</HI> Convert is like to do? Death (indeed) will <HI>eventually</HI> prove gain to every <HI>true</HI> Penitent. But then the <HI>Aggra∣vated</HI> Sins of Youth will afford a most <HI>melan∣choly</HI> Prospect unto him, that has <HI>wasted</HI> away the best of his Days in Sin and Vanity; and will in all probability <HI>extort</HI> such a <HI>mournful</HI> Petition as that in a <HI>Dying</HI> hour, Psal. 25.7. <HI>Remember not the Sins of my Youth, nor my Transgressions: according to thy mercy remem∣ber thou me, for thy goodness sake, O LORD.</HI> And this will very much <HI>damp</HI> the Joys and Comforts of his last Minutes. Whereas on the other hand, The <HI>Early</HI> Convert when he comes to lye upon a <HI>Death Bed,</HI> may first look <HI>back</HI> and take a Prospect of his past Life, and then look <HI>upward,</HI> and <HI>Appeal</HI> to God in the Language of holy <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> Isai. 38.3. — <HI>Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect heart, and have</HI> (by thy Grace) <HI>done that which is good in thy sight.</HI> And who but they that have had the <HI>happy</HI> Experience of of it, can tell how great the Consolation in it is?</P>
<P N="2">2. YOU will (doubtless) enjoy so much the more of the Comforts of the Holy Ghost at Death, by how much the sooner you set out in the Service of God. God will never <HI>forsake</HI> any of His Children in their <HI>greatest Extremity.</HI> He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> afford them His Enlightening, Supporting, and Comforting Presence in their most dark
<PB N="32" REF="002256_0108_0FDADE06B828B580"/>and disconsolate Hours. Hence that in Psal. 112.4. <HI>Unto the Upright there ariseth Light in Darkness.</HI> i. e. The <HI>Light</HI> of Divine Consola∣tion and the Joy of the Lord will <HI>refresh</HI> them in their <HI>deepest</HI> Distresses. May we there∣fore <HI>imagine,</HI> That the <HI>Early</HI> Convert shall <HI>miss</HI> of it in his <HI>last</HI> Conflict with Death? Or, Is it not much more reasonable to suppose, That since he set out <HI>betimes</HI> in the Work of his Lord, and has <HI>patiently</HI> born the <HI>heat</HI> and the <HI>burden</HI> of the Day, and is now come <HI>weary</HI> to the End of his Labours, that therefore his most <HI>Compassionate</HI> Lord has a more <HI>refreshing</HI> Cor∣dial to revive his spirits withal, now the <HI>shadows of the Evening</HI> are come upon him? See how <HI>David</HI> (one <HI>that feared the Lord from his Youth</HI>) comforted himself with the <HI>Hopes</HI> of this aforehand; (and doubtless he <HI>experi∣enced</HI> much <HI>more</HI> when he came to the <HI>Tryal</HI> than he had hitherto conceived of) Psal. 23.4. <HI>Yea tho' I walk thro' the valley of the shadow of Death I will fear no evil: for thou art with me, thy rod, and thy staff they comfort me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE <HI>sooner</HI> you begin to Live to God, the <HI>brighter</HI> are your <HI>Evidences</HI> for Heaven like to be in a Dying Hour. You'l then have this <HI>convincing</HI> Proof of the <HI>Sincerity</HI> and <HI>Up∣rightness</HI> of your Hearts which a <HI>later</HI> Peni∣tent will want, namely, That you <HI>renounced</HI> and <HI>abandoned</HI> your <HI>Sinful</HI> Lusts and Pleasures for the sake of your Great Saviour, when you were in the <HI>midst</HI> of the <HI>Strongest</HI> Temptati∣ons to <HI>pursue</HI> and <HI>gratify</HI> them; And were in
<PB N="33" REF="002256_0108_0FDADE06B828B580"/>the <HI>best</HI> condition for the <HI>Enjoyment</HI> of them. And then besides, 'Tis very probable, the <HI>Ho∣ly Spirit</HI> will give in a more <HI>clear</HI> and <HI>ample</HI> Testimony to the Truth of your Graces. And by this means you'l have the most <HI>ravishing</HI> Prospects of Happiness and Glory before your Eyes: And so pass thro' the <HI>Shades</HI> of Death in the <HI>Chariot</HI> of Praise. And then,</P>
<P N="1">1. Lastly, YOU will hereby <HI>leave</HI> a more <HI>honourable</HI> Name <HI>behind</HI> you at Death. The wise Man assures us, <HI>That the Memory of the Just is blessed,</HI> (Prov. 10.7.) But among these the Name of the <HI>Early</HI> Convert will ap∣pear in a <HI>brighter</HI> Character; with <HI>fewer</HI> stains upon it; and with <HI>more noble</HI> Embel∣lishments which will <HI>exceedingly</HI> recommend it to those he shall leave behind. These are the <HI>distinguishing</HI> Privileges and Honours of <HI>Early</HI> Religion in a dying Hour. And now, Children, were these the <HI>first Fruits</HI> you were ever like to reap of your <HI>Early</HI> Conversion to God, (which you <HI>abundantly</HI> see, from the preceeding Discourse, are not so: But sup∣pose it were so, yet) such <HI>Singular</HI> Privileges <HI>alone</HI> in a <HI>Dying</HI> Hour would <HI>more</HI> than re∣compence the most <HI>diligent</HI> Labours of the longest Life. But I must now Dismiss this <HI>Second</HI> general Head; and pass on more brief∣ly to say,</P>
<P N="3">III. WHAT the <HI>Special</HI> Advantages of <HI>Early</HI> Religion are like to be <HI>in the World to come.</HI> And here I shall mention but these two only,
<LIST>
<PB N="34" REF="002256_0109_0FDADE081595FC58"/>
<ITEM>1. IF you <HI>Dye</HI> Young (as who knows but you may) you will <HI>certainly</HI> be <HI>Admitted</HI> into the Kingdom of Heaven; while the <HI>wicked</HI> and <HI>profane</HI> Youth that <HI>Dyes in his Sins</HI> shall be <HI>cast down</HI> into Hell. Christ will gather the <HI>Lambs</HI> of His <HI>Fold</HI> into His own Bosome, while the Seed of evil Doers shall be <HI>rejected</HI> and <HI>excluded</HI> forever. And this will be such a <HI>dis∣tinguishing</HI> Glory, that <HI>Eternity</HI> it self will be short eno' to <HI>declare</HI> the <HI>Blessedness</HI> that will most <HI>certainly</HI> follow upon it. But then,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. SUPPOSE you shou'd live any <HI>consider∣able</HI> Time in the World, then <HI>afterwards</HI> you will be <HI>advanced</HI> to <HI>higher</HI> Degrees of Glory in the World to come. The Rewards of Hea∣ven, indeed, are not of <HI>Debt</HI> but of <HI>Grace,</HI> as they respect us. And therefore he that has spent the most Time, and done the most Ser∣vice for God in his Day, can't by any <HI>Des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> of his own lay <HI>claim</HI> to the <HI>least</HI> Degree of Heavenly Glory. But however, such are the <HI>Sovereign</HI> Determinations of Divine Grace, for the <HI>Encouragement</HI> of <HI>Early</HI> and <HI>industrious</HI> Piety, that God will <HI>Reward every man</HI> in the World to come, <HI>according to his works.</HI> (See Rom. 2.6.) i. e. God will render unto him, not only according to the <HI>Quality</HI> of his works in general, but in <HI>proportion</HI> to the <HI>Quantity</HI> of them. This is plain from the <HI>Parable</HI> of the <HI>Talents;</HI> as you find it recorded with the <HI>Explanation</HI> of it in, <HI>Mat.</HI> 25.10. — 30. Hence its evident, That Those who begin <HI>first</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d <HI>do most</HI> for God in their Day and Genera∣tion,
<PB N="35" REF="002256_0109_0FDADE081595FC58"/>shall be <HI>exalted</HI> to the <HI>highest</HI> Degrees of Glory in Heaven. The <HI>chief</HI> Seats in those <HI>blessed</HI> Mansions above are <HI>prepared</HI> for them, and stand <HI>ready</HI> to receive them. And there∣fore as they pass out of <HI>Time</HI> into <HI>Eternity,</HI> They shall be advanced to those Thrones of Glory; and from thence shall they <HI>Shine</HI> for∣ever and ever, as <HI>Stars</HI> of the <HI>first</HI> Magnitude in the <HI>Firmament</HI> of Glory. And what a <HI>Transcendent</HI> Privilege is this! The <HI>chief</HI> Seats of <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Dignity</HI> among Men, are very much <HI>sought</HI> after, and <HI>prized</HI> by the Men of this World. But the <HI>least</HI> Degree of <HI>Heavenly</HI> Glory is <HI>infinitely</HI> more <HI>excellent</HI> than all the Glory of the World put together. There is such <HI>Immensity</HI> in it, <HI>That Eye has not seen, nor Ear heard, neither has it entred into the Heart of Man, to conceive of it, as it really is.</HI> How <HI>Surprizingly</HI> great then will the Honour and Happiness be, not only to be <HI>Ad∣mitted</HI> to the Glories of Heaven; but to be <HI>Advanced</HI> to the <HI>highest</HI> Degrees of that Glo∣ry? Verily, Heaven it self will <HI>forever</HI> ring with the <HI>loudest</HI> Acclamations of Praise from such as shall be the <HI>Objects</HI> of this <HI>distin∣guishing, eternal</HI> Favour.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>THUS I have passed thro' the <HI>several</HI> par∣ticulars at first proposed. And I might have enlarged upon every one of them to very great Advantage would the Time have al∣lowed.</P>
<P>BUT since it will not I will finish the pre∣sent Discourse will this brief Reflection upon the Whole. viz.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="002256_0110_0FDADE0983850BF8"/>
SINCE the <HI>peculiar</HI> Advantages of <HI>Early</HI> Re∣ligion are such as we have heard, Those of you that are in your YOUTHFUL DAYS should improve the Consideration of them as a most powerful Argument, <HI>to Seek, and Serve God, the God of your Fathers,</HI> without any far∣ther Delay. It is not possible you should have any more <HI>alluring</HI> and <HI>perswasive</HI> Motives to the Duty than are contained in the Things that have already been set before you. I have therefore nothing farther to offer at this Time to enforce the <HI>Advice</HI> upon you. But shall Conclude with my <HI>earnest Wish</HI> and <HI>Prayer</HI> to that GOD, with Whom is the <HI>Suc∣cess</HI> of all our Labours, that He would be pleased <HI>graciously</HI> to bless <HI>this,</HI> and all the <HI>o∣ther</HI> Endeavours of this kind, which (I trust) are Sincerly Designed by His Servants, for your <HI>highest</HI> and <HI>best</HI> Good.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">A</SEG>N Essay to promote early Piety, to teach Young Peo∣ple that <HI>Fear of the Lord</HI> which <HI>is the Beginning of Wisdom,</HI> and that <HI>good Un∣derstanding</HI> which <HI>all they have who do God's Command∣ments,</HI> must needs be allow'd to be very Noble and Worthy. In Prosecu∣tion
<PB N="2" REF="002256_0111_0FDADE0E142C7D60"/>of such a Design, our young people have had in several Discourses the <HI>Duties</HI> of early Piety explain'd, their <HI>Obligations</HI> to it laid down, and the <HI>Advantages</HI> of it set forth. The Part assign'd me towards this Work, is to consider the <HI>Discouragements,</HI> reply to the <HI>Objections,</HI> which may arise in the Minds of any of them against being early Religious, and which Satan, (who to be sure will do all he can to Counterwork us) will not fail to call before them. The Text I have read, and only propose to take Rise from, will ap∣pear, I hope, not altogether improper to the Occasion, if we consider the Story which it relates to, and is a part of. There was a hopeful, sober, well inclin'd <HI>Young Gentleman</HI> (as he is by some call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d) of a plentiful Estate, and in some public Post, who came to CHRIST and Address'd Him upon a most se∣rious and Important Case: <HI>Good Master, what good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal Life?</HI> This Young Man was Instructed in and did believe the Doctrine of eternal Life; and was concern'd how he might obtain it: He was sensible there was something to be done in order to the obtaining of it; and was de∣sirous to know what it was that he might do it. He applies himself for Information a∣bout this Matter, the best that cou'd be; to the fittest <HI>Person,</HI> even to our Lord <HI>JESUS</HI> CHRIST, who is the great <HI>Teacher come from God,</HI> who alone has <HI>the Words of Eternal Life;</HI> and who is Himself <HI>the Way, the Truth, and
<PB N="3" REF="002256_0111_0FDADE0E142C7D60"/>the Life;</HI> and after a very fit <HI>Manner,</HI> with Humility and Earnestness. <HI>Mark</HI> says, that <HI>he came running, and kneel'd to Him;</HI> and by the <HI>Question</HI> it self as he here puts it, he seems to be in good earnest: <HI>Good Master what shall I do,</HI> &amp;c?</P>
<P>IT was a <HI>lovely sight this</HI> to behold. It is truly a blessed sight to see any Persons seriously con∣cern'd about their Souls &amp; another World, solli∣tously inquiring how they may get to Heaven. It is especially a lovely sight to see <HI>Young Persons</HI> so concern'd, <HI>thus</HI> inquisitive. A <HI>lovely</HI> sight this! but alass! how <HI>rare</HI> among the Young People of the present day? It is too rare a∣mong Young People of every Quality, who are generally apt to think, it is time eno' yet for such an Enquiry; but <HI>especially</HI> among such as rise up in the World in superior Cir∣cumstances with respect to outward Rank and Estate, who having mighty notions about <HI>this</HI> World, do but little regard the things of another; whose <HI>earthly</HI> Inheritance too often takes off their eyes and hearts from the <HI>heavenly.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Saviour in Answer to the Question of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his Young Man, says to Him, <HI>If thou wilt en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r into Life, keep the Commandments.</HI> There <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s one way of Salvation for Old and Young, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iz. the way of Faith, Repentance, and holy <HI>Obedience.</HI> They that don't walk in the Way of God's Commandments, are certainly out of the Path of Life. This is the Way that God has mark'd out, and there is no think∣ing of any other. And <HI>blessed are they that
<PB N="4" REF="002256_0112_0FDADE0F97DA1058"/>do his Commandments, that they may have right to the tree of Life, and may enter in thro' the gates into the</HI> holy <HI>City,</HI> Rev. 22.14. <HI>Young Persons</HI> are as much bound and obliged to keep the Commandments of God as others are: Nor must they think that the Heedlesness and Inconsiderateness of Youth will excuse or justify them, when they wander out of the Way thereof. No: It is expected from them, that they <HI>take heed to their way according to God's Word;</HI> they must <HI>bear the Yoke,</HI> the Yoke of God's Commandments, <HI>in their Youth,</HI> if they would <HI>see Life,</HI> obtain Happiness here and hereafter. Christ says to this Young Man, <HI>If thou wilt enter into life, keep the Command∣ments.</HI></P>
<P>THE Young Man asks of Him again, <HI>Which?</HI> He might have concluded <HI>all:</HI> For there is the same Authority enjo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning one as another, and every Command of God is equally oblig∣ing. But he asks, we'll suppose, for a more full and particular Information; that he might know which were of the greatest Im∣portance, and which he must have a more especial Regard unto. And we should all of us endeavour to get as clear and distinct <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Knowledge of our Duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> we can. We shou'd desire to know what is good, and what the Lord our God doth require of <HI>us.</HI></P>
<P>CH<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>T in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nceth to him in several of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the Second Table.

<P>[THESE Commandments which our Saviour <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere instanceth in, and so recommends to the Young Man as necessary for him to observe and keep, our Young People have had explain'd to them in those Discourses which opened the <HI>Nature</HI> of Early Piety as it relates to <HI>others,</HI> and unto <HI>themselves.</HI>]</P>
<P>THE Young Man replys, <HI>All these have I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ept from my Youth: what lack I yet?</HI> It had been happy for him indeed if he could have <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ightly</HI> and <HI>truly</HI> made such an Answer as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>his, <HI>All these have I kept from my Youth:</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ut it was a confident boasting that discover'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is great Ignorance and Conceit. Had he known the Spiritu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y and Extent of the Di∣vine Law, that it not only forbids the out∣ward Acts, but the inward Lusts and Motions of the heart, he would never have answered <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hus, but on the contrary would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> said
<PB N="6" REF="002256_0113_0FDADE110B1E40A0"/>with Concern and Shame, and Grief, (as the best of us have reason to do before God) <HI>"all these have I broken from my Youth".</HI> However, according as <HI>he</HI> understood the Law, 'tis thought, he said true. Take them <HI>externally,</HI> and in the literal sense, and he might have kept the Commandments. He might be un∣reproveable with respect to them before Men, tho' he could not be before the All-seeing, Heart-searching God. He was free from any gross Violation of them; And it was a happy thing that he could <HI>so</HI> speak. It is truly a Favour of God to any, which they should think of with Thankfulness to him, when their Youth has not been stain'd by any scandalous Sins. But we must not think <HI>this</HI> sufficient; we must not stop <HI>here;</HI> for meer Morality will never carry any to Heaven. It is not enough for you, <HI>Young Persons,</HI> that you be blameless in your outward Carriage and Con∣versation, but you must become really, in∣wardly practically religious and godly. Ma∣ny cannot say for themselves what this Young Man d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d; and yet as far as <HI>he</HI> went, he did not go far eno'; he was not <HI>altogether</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christian, but was like to come short of E∣ternal Life.</P>
<P>CHRIST therefore, in Answer to his fur∣ther Inquiry, <HI>What lack I yet;</HI> tells him what he must come up to, if he would approve himself a <HI>Christian indeed</HI> and so make sure of Eternal Life. <HI>Jesus said unto him, if tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou hast, and give
<PB N="7" REF="002256_0113_0FDADE110B1E40A0"/>to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in Hea∣ven; and come and follow me.</HI> Religion in∣dispensably requires this of every one of us that we do resolvedly and practically, prefer Heaven before Earth, a Part in Christ before all the Wealth and Riches in this World, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to be willing and ready to part with our <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll</HI> in this World, for Christ and Heaven, if He should call us thereunto: Upon no less Terms can any of us now be the true Disci∣ples of Jesus Christ. To prove this Young Man therefore, and see whether he was in∣deed so set for Heaven and Eternal Life as he seem'd to be, Christ gives him this <Q>Com∣mand of Trial</Q>, <HI>Go, sell all thou hast in this World, and give it to the poor, and follow me, and take up with a Treasure in Heaven in∣stead of all.</HI> At this it was that he <HI>went away sorrowful.</HI> He could not comply with this Motion. Could not come up to these Terms. He <HI>Objected</HI> against this as an <HI>hard saying,</HI> and was <HI>discourag'd</HI> by it from following Christ, and any more seeking after Eternal Life. If Religion would cost him so dear as this came to, he must even have done with the Tho'ts of it. This Saying of Christ was such a <HI>Discouragement</HI> and <HI>Objection</HI> as he could not get over; it proved a fatal Hinderance and Impediment to him.</P>
<P>BUT it is now time for me to dismiss the <HI>Text</HI> and <HI>Context,</HI> and to apply my self to that <HI>single Part</HI> assign'd me in the present
<PB N="8" REF="002256_0114_0FDAC97BDA8B0F28"/>Work, which as I told you before is to consi∣der and reply to some <HI>Discouragements</HI> and <HI>Objections</HI> which <HI>Young People</HI> may have a∣gainst being Religious in their <HI>Youthful Days.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. I. IF I am Religious in my Youthful Days (may the Young Person think and say) <HI>I shall debar and deprive my self of those Pleasures and Delights of Life, which Youth is the proper Season for the Taste and Injoyment of.</HI></P>
<P>TO this I Answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. RELIGION does not <HI>wholly</HI> debar you of and restrain you from the Delights and Pleasures of this Life. I deed you must not <HI>make Pro∣vision for the flesh, to fu fit the Lusts thereof.</HI> You must not give Appetite and Sense its full Swinge. Nevertheless, there is not a total Restraint laid upon you. It is not criminal for you to be cheerful and merry in Conver∣sation. Young people may use the Divertise∣ments and Pleasures of life, such as are pro∣per to their Age, so as they do but keep within the Bounds of Innocence and Modera∣tion. Religion is not such a sower ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aturd thing as you may imagine it to be. It does not give a <HI>total</HI> Prohibition of earthly Plea∣sures, but allows of, yea directs to the sober and moderate Use of them. Eccl. 9.7, 8, 9. <HI>Go thy Way, eat thy Bread with Joy, and drink thy Wine with a merry heart; for God now ac∣cepteth thy Works. Let thy Garments be always white; and let thy Head lack no Oinment. Live
<PB N="9" REF="002256_0114_0FDAC97BDA8B0F28"/>joyfully with the Wise whom thou lovest, all the days of the life of thy Vanity, which he hath given thee under the Sun: for that is thy Portion in this Life, and in thy Labour which thou takest under the Sun. Use</HI> this World you may, so you do not <HI>abuse</HI> it. Religion would only direct and lead you to such a Use and Injoyment of earthly Pleasures and Delights, as may be without Offence to God, and Hurt to your selves.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Pleasures which Religion requires you to deny yourselves in, and abandon; <HI>What are they?</HI> They are <HI>mean</HI> and <HI>base</HI> at best; suited only to the Inferior Part of Man. They have in them more of the Beast than the Man; and the Bruit Creatures may have a more exquisite Sense of them than we have. And what are these to a rational Soul? To us, whom God hath <HI>taught more than the Beasts of the Earth; and made wiser than the Fowls of Heaven?</HI> They are <HI>false</HI> and <HI>deceitful;</HI> have in them the Shew of Pleasure only, and not the Substance, the Appearance and Name rather than the Thing; The Fruition of them does not answer the Expectation. <HI>Solomon</HI> ran a prodigious length in Sensualities, in the Pursuit of forbidden Pleasures. He <HI>prov'd his heart with Mirth,</HI> &amp; <HI>gave himself to know Mad∣ness and Folly; whatsoever his Eyes desired he kept not from them, he withheld not his Heart from any Joy.</HI> Well, and what Satisfaction did all this afford him? Why truly none at all. <HI>He said of Laughter it is mad: and of
<PB N="10" REF="002256_0115_0FDADE142F99FD48"/>Mirth, what doeth it?</HI> Eccl. 2.2. Again, they are <HI>vanishing</HI> and <HI>perishing.</HI> The World pass∣eth away, and so do the Lusts thereof. The Pleasures of Sin they are <HI>but for a Sea∣son,</HI> and a very short Season too. They will <HI>perish in the using.</HI> They are easily disturb'd and dash'd, and quickly over and gone. Once more, They are <HI>destructive</HI> and <HI>deadly.</HI> Bitter Sweets! They please and gratify now, but they will fling and torment hereafter. The Fruit and End of them is <HI>Death.</HI> Prov. 9.17, 18. <HI>Stolen Waters are sweet, and Bread eaten in secret is pleasant. But he knoweth not that the Dead are there; and that her guests are in the Depths of Hell.</HI> So then the Pleasures which Religion requires you to abandon, are such as you have little Reason to be fond of: However the corrupt heart may find some Reluctancy in refusing them, yet (as one apt∣ly uses here the Words of <HI>Abigail</HI> to <HI>David</HI> about his denying himself the Satisfaction of being reveng'd on <HI>Nabal</HI>) <HI>afterwards it shall be no G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ief unto you, nor Offence of heart,</HI> 1 Sam. 25.31.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE Delights and Pleasures which are to be found in the Ways of Religion, are <HI>Incom∣parably better</HI> that those which you m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st de∣ny yourselves in and abandon. There is this Commendation given of <HI>Wisdoms</HI> Ways, Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>v. 3.17. <HI>Her Ways are Ways of Pleasantness, and all her Paths are Peace.</HI> They are not only pleasant Ways, but Ways of Pleasantness, in the <HI>Abstract;</HI> as one observes upon the Place.
<PB N="11" REF="002256_0115_0FDADE142F99FD48"/>There is such Pleasantness no where else to be found as in these Ways. The Delights that are to be met with in the Way of Duty and Religion are such as the greatest Sensua∣list cannot boast of. The Pleasures of Piety do exceed the Pleasures of Sin and Sense, in the <HI>Subject</HI> of them; the Soul the better and more noble part. In the <HI>Object</HI> of them; an Infinite God, a glorious Christ, all spiritual Blessings in heavenly Places. And in the <HI>Pro∣perties</HI> of them; they are true and solid, pure and substantial, rational and sublime, durable and lasting, not so easily dash'd and broken by the little Accidents and sudden Changes of this life, and the <HI>longer</HI> the Injoy∣ment is, the <HI>higher</HI> the Pleasure rises.</P>
<P>WHAT are the poor &amp; <HI>beggarly</HI> Pleasures of this life, to the Testimony of a good Conscience, Joy in the Holy Ghost, Delight in God, and Communion with Him? Such as abandon sensual Pleasures for spiritual Delights, and holy Joys, they only exchange Dirt and Trash for Gold and Pearls, leave the <HI>Garlick</HI> and <HI>Onions</HI> of <HI>Egypt</HI> for the <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Honey</HI> of <HI>Canaan.</HI> O our <HI>Young People!</HI> If you did but once experience the Pleasures of true Piety, they would put your Mouths out of taste to the Pleasures of Sin and Sense; having tasted of this <HI>new</HI> Wine, you would not ask for the <HI>old,</HI> because the <HI>new</HI> is better. That pious Youth, <HI>Mr. Thomas Beard,</HI> who died at about Seventeen Years of Age, (whose Life is publish'd, and recommended to Young peo∣ple
<PB N="12" REF="002256_0116_0FDADE1585C3A5A0"/>by the late <HI>Mr. Henry,</HI> and is in some of your hands) could from his own happy Ex∣perience write down such lines as these, <HI>There is nothing of Delight in the World comparable to what I have found in the Enjoyment of God. One Hours, yea one Moments Communion with God, is far beyond the sensual Delights of a whole Life. I have met with true and solid Comf<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rt, and Soul satisfying Joy in the Way of Duty and Religion.</HI> O <HI>taste &amp; see</HI> if it be not so.</P>
<P>Obj. II. <HI>THE Work of Religion is very hard and difficult;</HI> and I fear that if I make a Trial I shall find it insuperable, and not be able to go thro' with it.</P>
<P>Answ. WE would deal plainly and truly with you, and let you know the worst before-hand, that so you may sit down and <HI>count the Cost</HI> before you begin to build, and may so set out as that you may not turn back discou∣rag'd by meeting with what you did not ex∣pect: We do therefore acknowledge it to you, that <HI>it is no easy thing to be a true and thorough Christian.</HI> Those that are most acquainted with practical Religion, and the Power of Godliness, know this. The Christan Life is compar'd in Scripture to <HI>running a Race,</HI> to <HI>wrestling,</HI> to <HI>fighting,</HI> and the like; all which imply Difficulty, Opposition, Hardness, and the great Need there is of Skill, Activity, Strength, Resolution and Patience. Religion does not consult your carnal Ease, and Plea∣sures. There are many laborious Duties for
<PB N="13" REF="002256_0116_0FDADE1585C3A5A0"/>you to perform, many <HI>Temptations</HI> to resist, <HI>Corruptions</HI> to mortify, and <HI>Conflicts</HI> to en∣dure. A few <HI>lazy</HI> Wishes and <HI>faint</HI> Endea∣vours will never carry you to Heaven. You must <HI>watch and be sober, watch and pray, watch and work;</HI> you must <HI>gird up the Loins of your Minds, and put</HI> on and manage <HI>the whole Ar∣mour of God,</HI> press on, and fight thro'. You must overcome the <HI>World,</HI> the <HI>Flesh,</HI> and the <HI>Devil,</HI> and <HI>take the Kingdom of Heaven by</HI> an holy <HI>Violence.</HI> Nevertheless, tho' the Work of Religion be thus hard and difficult, you should not <HI>object</HI> against it, you may not be <HI>discourag'd</HI> from it on the Account hereof.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. IF there is any Truth in Religion, the Dif∣ficulty that attends the Practice of it, cannot be allow'd to be a reasonable or sufficient Ob∣jection against it. If there be a God that made you, that has a Right to rule you now and to judge you hereafter. If you have Im∣mortal Souls within you, that must Live for∣ever either in a World of Happiness or in a World of Misery. If you are hastning either to Heaven or Hell; and it is like to fare with you in the other World according as you have Liv'd in this: I say, if these things be true which Religion teaches, (as they cer∣tainly are, and as you do believe that they are) why then surely <HI>no</HI> Pains can be judg'd too much to take, <HI>no</HI> Difficulties too great to be undergone, in an Affair of <HI>so</HI> high a Concern. Can you think any thing too much
<PB N="14" REF="002256_0117_0FDADE1AE8D22648"/>for to save your Souls, to escape Hell and ob∣tain Heaven? Oh what Pains will Men take, what Difficulties will they go through, what Hardships will they endure in prosecuting Matters of far less Concernment; in Affairs that relate only to the Body and the Life that now is? What Trouble will Men be at to get the Riches, or the Honours, or the Pleasures of this World? <HI>Compassing both Sea and Land</HI> for them. What a Folly then, what a Shame is it for you to make such an Objecti∣on in this Case? Wherein, if in any thing at all, <HI>Necessity is laid upon you,</HI> and <HI>Woe to you</HI> if you do not comply? One would think there is nothing so difficult, but it should be readi∣ly and willingly entred upon and engaged in, if the Salvation of the Soul, and the eternal Welfare of that, be at all concern'd in it.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Difficulty that attends the Practice of Religion and Godliness can be no sufficient Objection against it, because <HI>The Way of Sin and Wickedness is attended with as much or more.</HI> It is really so, that there is many times more Self-denial undergone, and Pains taken, in the Service of Sin and Lust, than the Prac∣tice of Religion calls for. Prov. 13.15. <HI>The way of Transgressors is hard,</HI> Jer. 9.5. <HI>They weary themselves to commit Iniquity.</HI> There is no worse Slavery than to Live in the Pur∣suit of base Lusts. How is the Sinner in the Gratification of them, carried by Vio∣lence and Headlong, contrary to the Dictates of his Reason, and the Checks of Conscience?
<PB N="15" REF="002256_0117_0FDADE1AE8D22648"/>How is his Time consumed therein, his Estate often wasted, and his Body enfeebled? How <Q>many Thousands die Martyrs to their Lusts, and are burnt with as keen a Fire (tho' not so honourable) as that the <HI>Martyrs</HI> were fry'd in?</Q> Sometimes the very <HI>Contri∣vance</HI> of Sin gives sufficient Uneasiness and Trouble; but more especially the <HI>Reflection</HI> on it. How does the Sinner start and recoil at his own Actions when he thinks them over? One of the greatest Troubles in this World is for a Sinner to look within himself, and re∣member what he has done. The Scripture speaks of the Condition of Sinners in this World as full of Uneasiness and Disquiet. Isai. 57.20, 21. <HI>The wicked are like the troubled sea when it cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt: There is no peace saith my God unto the wicked.</HI> Such often dissemble their Con∣dition, <Q>and make an <HI>appearance</HI> of Satis∣faction; but God who is acquainted with the secrets of all hearts, knows what horror rages in their Breasts.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. WHATEVER Difficulty attends the Practice of Religion and Godliness, <HI>the Grace of God can enable you thereunto notwithstand∣ing.</HI> You are not left to struggle with the difficulties of Religion in your own single Strength, but God is ready to afford you His Help and Assistance, <HI>thro' whom strengthning of us we can do all things.</HI> You have not only the Outward Arguments of Religion to encourage you to encounter the difficulties of
<PB N="16" REF="002256_0118_0FDADE1C448D4C68"/>it, but the Promise of His Holy Spirit to help and assist you. Ezek. 11.19. <HI>I will put my spirit within them, and they shall walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments and do them.</HI> He is ready to do this for all that sin∣cerely and in good earnest apply themselves to Him. Wherefore instead of objecting a∣gainst, or being discouraged from Religion by reason of the difficulties that attend the practice of it, you should only be quicken'd thereby, according to the advice of the <HI>A∣postle,</HI> Heb. 4.16. <HI>to come boldly to the throne of Grace, that you may find grace to help you in time of need.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THE greatest difficulty will be in your <HI>first setting out</HI> in the Ways of Religion. What in Religion may seem hard at first, thro' the Corruption of our Nature, and our former Ac∣customedness to Sin, afterwards Use and Ex∣ercise and the Grace of God will make easy. When once you are well entred in the Service of God, you will find it perfect Freedom; and in a little time you will be able to attest to the truth of that, 1 Joh. 5.3. <HI>His Com∣mandments are not grievous.</HI> Christ's Yoke, (says One) grows easier and smoother, when we have born it upon us; tho' perhaps at the very first putting on, the flesh will strive hard to fling it off. I remember to have read in the Life of Mr. <HI>Philip Henry,</HI> that he once in Preaching from those words, Mat. 11.30. <HI>My yoke is easy,</HI> after many things insisted on to prove the Yoke of Christ an easy Yoke,
<PB N="17" REF="002256_0118_0FDADE1C448D4C68"/>at last appeal'd to the <HI>Experiences</HI> of all that had any time drawn in that Yoke, and then gave in his own Testimony after this affecting manner. <HI>I,</HI> said he, <HI>will here witness for one, who through Grace have in some poor Measure been drawing in this Yoke, now above Thirty Years, and I have found it an easy Yoke, and like my Choice too well to change.</HI></P>
<P>Once more here,</P>
<P N="5">5. THERE is that Sweetness and Pleasure <HI>accompanying</HI> the Practice of Religion and God∣liness, and that glorious Reward <HI>following</HI> it, that far out-weigh all its Troubles and Difficulties. I might here show, if my pre∣sent Limits would allow, how that in <HI>all</HI> the several <HI>Acts, Instances,</HI> and <HI>Duties</HI> of Religion, even those that seem the <HI>hard Lessons of Christi∣anity,</HI> there is a Sweetness and Pleasure to be found, not only to support but delight the Soul. Her Ways are Ways of Pleasantness, and <HI>all</HI> her Paths are Peace.</P>
<P>AND then, what a <HI>blessed Hope</HI> is set before you in the end to invite &amp; animate you? All the Diffi∣culties of Religion will be abundantly compen∣sated by a glorious Recompence of Reward in the next World. Religion proposes so great a Reward to you, as that if you should spend your whole Life in Labour and Toil for it, it would be worth the while. It is the most noble that Mans Nature is capable of; set forth to us in Scripture by many chosen Com∣parisons, as particularly by a royal <HI>Throne,</HI> a glorious <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and a glittering <HI>Crown.</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="002256_0119_0FDADE1DC3FC8200"/>Rev. 3.21. <HI>Him that overcometh will I gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t to sit with me on my Throne, even as I overcame, and am set down with my Fath<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r on his Throne.</HI> Luk. 22.29. <HI>I appoint unto you a Kingdom, as my Father appointed unto me.</HI> Rev. 2.10. <HI>be faithful unto Death, and I will give thee a Crown of life.</HI> There is nothing greater aspired after by the ambitious Children of Men than a Crown and Kingdom; and they will wade thro' Fields and Seas of Blood to obtain one; and yet they <HI>strive</HI> but for a <HI>corruptible Crown.</HI> The Crown and Kingdom which Christ sets before you in the Gospel, is not like the Crowns and Kingdoms of this World, trou∣blesome, thorny, tottering, fading things, but easy, steady, safe, and that shall never fade away. And now, O <HI>Young Man,</HI> shall not this so tempt and fire your Ambition as to make you think all Difficulty light and in∣considerable that may lie in your way. Will not this, think you, countervail for a few days labour and difficulty?</P>
<P>Obj. III. BUT <HI>Religion will expose me to many Troubles and Sufferings:</HI> It is <HI>thro' much Tribulation that we must enter into the Kingdom of God:</HI> And <HI>all that will live godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer Persecution.</HI></P>
<P>TO this it may be answered, that</P>
<P>TROUBLES and Sufferings are to be met with <HI>out</HI> of the way of Religion. The Un∣godly (besides <HI>Inward</HI> Troubles which are the
<PB N="19" REF="002256_0119_0FDADE1DC3FC8200"/>(worst) are liable to the same <HI>outward</HI> Afflicti∣ons that others are; such as Bodily S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ck∣nesses and Pains, the Deaths of near Rela∣tives, Disappointments, Losses, and Impove∣rishments, in their outward Estate. With respect to such things as these, we are told, <HI>All things come alike to all, there is one Event to the Righteous and to the wicked,</HI> Eccl. 9.2. So that as to the <HI>common</HI> &amp; <HI>ordinary</HI> Afflictions of this Life, you'l be expos'd to them <HI>out</HI> of the way of Religion as well as <HI>in</HI> it.</P>
<P>AS to any <HI>Extraordinary</HI> Sufferings purely on the Account of Religion, such as the loss of Liberty, Estate or Life, (tho' indeed we should be ready to part with <HI>these</HI> in the Cause and for the Sake of Religion, should we be called to it, yet) you are not sure you shall meet with any of these. <HI>Bonds and Afflictions</HI> don't always <HI>abide</HI> the Saints. God don't call every one to <HI>resist unto Blood.</HI> Thanks be to God! Our Lot is cast in a Place and Time of Liberty and Peace, wherein the <HI>Churches have Rest and are Edified!</HI></P>
<P>BUT suppose the worst, that you should be call<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to any <HI>such</HI> Sufferings on the account of Religion; the Sufferings can be but very short. The sharpest Sufferings of the present Time, they are <HI>bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or a moment,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.17. And then where God calls His Saints to extraordinary <HI>Sufferings,</HI> he usually gives them extraordinary <HI>Supports</HI> &amp; Consolations under them. S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Suffering Saints have said, <HI>As the Sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our
<PB N="20" REF="002256_0120_0FDADE1F88A1F9E8"/>Consolation also aboundeth by Christ,</HI> 2 Cor. 1.5</P>
<P>MOREOVER, the greater your Sufferings are here, the greater will be your Reward in Heaven: They will <HI>work out</HI> for you <HI>a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</HI> And <HI>I reckon,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>that the Suffer∣ings of the present time, are not worthy to be compared with the Glory that shall be revealed in us,</HI> Rom. 8.18.</P>
<P>AND then, let it be considered by you, that if you do not become Religious, you ex∣pose yourselves to the <HI>endless</HI> and Insupporta∣ble Miseries of the <HI>next</HI> Life, which the most exquisite Torments of the present Life, are but faint Resemblances of.</P>
<P>SO that upon the whole of <HI>this matter,</HI> it will be your Wisdom, <HI>Young People,</HI> to make <HI>Moses</HI> his Choice, who when he was <HI>come is Years, chose rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God, than to injoy the Pleasures of Sin for a Season.</HI> Heb. 11.24, 25.</P>
<P>Obj. IV. BUT I shall be <HI>reproach'd, derided</HI> and <HI>scoff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d at,</HI> especially by my old Acquain∣tance and Companions, if I should now set up for serious Religion.</P>
<P>TO this I Answer,</P>
<P>THAT it is no Disgrace to <HI>be</HI> derided and mock'd at, but to <HI>deserve</HI> to be so. The best of Men have been so▪ Such as <HI>David,</HI> and <HI>Job,</HI> and <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> and others <HI>of whom the World was not worthy.</HI> And I might Name a Greater than these, even our Lord JESUS
<PB N="21" REF="002256_0120_0FDADE1F88A1F9E8"/>CHRIST, a great part of whose Sufferings were the Derisions and Mockings that He met with.</P>
<P>THE Jests and Scoffs you may meet with, will be so far from a Disparagement to you, that they will be your Honour; and while they deride and mock you, others, the <HI>wiser</HI> and <HI>better</HI> Sort, will esteem and reverence you, and give you their best Regards.</P>
<P>YOU had better be derided by o∣thers, than have your own Conscience re∣proaching of you; and it is no Matter in whose Eyes you are contemned, so as you are but <HI>great in the Sight of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THE Reproaches wherewith some, that <HI>sit in the Seat of the Scornful</HI> may reproach you, for your turning into the Way of Godliness, will <HI>fall upon themselves,</HI> will turn to their Condemnation and sorer Punishment, in that Day when Sinners must account for <HI>all their hard Speeches;</HI> but they will turn to your Ad∣vantage and Blessedness. For our Saviour has said, <HI>Blessed are ye when Men shall revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil a∣gainst you falsly for my sake. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad; for great is your Reward in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>AND it will not be long before those who now deride and censure you, will openly ap∣plaud and commend you, as the only wise and happy. <Q><HI>We fools counted their Life Madness, and their End to be without Honour, how are they numbred with the Children of
<PB N="22" REF="002256_0121_0FDADE224446CD88"/>God, and their Lot among the Saints?</HI></Q> So that the Reproaches you may meet with should be <HI>far</HI> from discouraging of you, they shou'd <HI>rather</HI> make you more Resolute in the Ways of God. You should Answer the Scorners, as <HI>David</HI> replied to the Taunt and Reproach of <HI>Michal</HI> the Daughter of <HI>Saul; It was before the Lord — And I will yet be more vile than thus,</HI> 2 Sam. 6.21, 22.</P>
<P>Obj. V. <HI>RELIGION is no Friend to Prosperity:</HI> I must look to be poor and low in the World, if I become religious; for I observe the <HI>most</HI> are so that are Religious.</P>
<P>I may reply here,</P>
<P>THAT it is a most foolish and absurd thing, to be Influenc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d by <HI>external</HI> Motives, and <HI>tem∣poral</HI> Considerations, in matters of <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> Concernment. <HI>What,</HI> I beseech you, <HI>is a Man profited, if he gain the whose World, and lose his own Soul; or what shall a Man give in Exchange for his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oul?</HI></P>
<P>IT is true indeed, that the <HI>godly</HI> in the Earth, are often the <HI>poor</HI> of it, and <HI>Brethren of l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w Degree:</HI> But then they are in <HI>that</HI> State, in <HI>those</HI> Circumstances which Infinite Wisdom sees best for them, and in which their spiri∣tual and eternal Welfare is most promoted, the best secured. And <HI>the Soul is the Man;</HI> that is best for Us, which is best for our <HI>Souls.</HI> If the Wicked have more of this World, they have need eno' of it; for it is <HI>their</HI> Portion: But <HI>deliver me, O Lord, from the Men of this
<PB N="23" REF="002256_0121_0FDADE224446CD88"/>World, which have their Portion in this Life!</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER the <HI>Objection</HI> is <HI>not true</HI> nei∣ther: For Religion <HI>is</HI> a Friend to outward Prosperity. <HI>Godliness is profitable to all things.</HI> The Blessing of Temporals is in the Covenant; (as was show'd you under the Head of <HI>Ad∣vantages,</HI> and therefore I will pass it here.)</P>
<P>BUT at last, Piety is the <HI>best</HI> Prosperity. <HI>The Merchandize whereof is better than the Mer∣chandize of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold. Her Fruit is better than Gold, and her Revenue than choice Silver.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. VI. RELIGION is <HI>no fashionable thing;</HI> there are but few that really mind it, of a∣ny Age or Quality; why should I be al∣most singular?</P>
<P>I Answer,</P>
<P>SERIOUS Religion, and strict Godliness, is but an Unfashionable thing in the World. The more's the Pity! But <HI>yet</HI> it is of <HI>Infinite Concernment</HI> to <HI>us</HI> that <HI>we</HI> heartily embrace it.</P>
<P>LET none urge <HI>this</HI> Objection, unless they are willing to loose the Favour of God, the Happiness of Heaven, and their own precious and immortal Souls out of Genteelity, unless they are willing to be damn'd and go to Hell for Fashion's sake; This I hope you'l account too great a Complement.</P>
<P>WE should let no Example influence us con∣trary to what is our Duty and Interest. We shou'd not <HI>follow a Multitude to do evil;</HI> nor be <HI>conform'd to this World.</HI> The <HI>broad Way</HI> is
<PB N="24" REF="002256_0122_0FDADE20C3ED18B0"/>never the <HI>better</HI> for being crowded. Hell will be never the <HI>pleasanter</HI> for the Company that is in it.</P>
<P>RELIGION is never the <HI>worse</HI> in it self let <HI>who</HI> will, and as <HI>many</HI> as will, sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght it. Sooner or later most Men testify to the Wisdom of it <NOTE N="†"><HI>Vid.</HI> Dying Mens Living Words. <HI>Published by Dr.</HI> Lloyd.</NOTE>. Do you not observe, that they who care not to <HI>live the Life</HI> of the <HI>Righteous,</HI> yet de∣sire to <HI>die their Death,</HI> and to have their <HI>last End</HI> like theirs? <Q>Of the thousands whose Deaths we have seen or heard, what one Person, ever recommended an Irreligious Life (to those that stood about him, ready to gather his last breath) as Desireable; and did not rather warn them from it as Mis∣chievous and Ruinous? What one Man in the World ever repented of a good life, when he came to die; and did not rather, with <HI>Tears</HI> for his own Miscarriages, and with all the <HI>Arguments</HI> imaginable exhort to it? That Person in a dying hour shall wish himself no Man, that hath not been a good Christian.</Q></P>
<P>Obj. VII. IF I am Religious in my Youth∣ful Days, <HI>I shall die Young.</HI> This is what Sa∣tan has sometimes buzz'd in the Ears of some seriously dispos'd Young Persons to affright and deter them. To it I say,</P>
<P>THAT tho' Piety does not <HI>secure</HI> a long Life in this World, yet to be sure it never <HI>shorten'd</HI> any ones Life in it: It is more <HI>likely</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="002256_0122_0FDADE20C3ED18B0"/>to prolong it. For it keeps us from those <HI>Vices</HI> and <HI>Excesses</HI> which shorten Mens Lives. And it has the Promise of it, 1 Tim. 4.8. <HI>Godliness is profitable unto all things, having the Promise of the Life that now is.</HI></P>
<P>THE Irreligious, they to be sure, have <HI>no Reason</HI> to expect to live long in the World, Eccl. 8.13. <HI>It shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e prolong his Days, because he fear∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th not God.</HI> And we <HI>do see</HI> that many Un∣godly ones die young. Job. 36.14. <HI>They die in Youth, and their Life is among the Unclean.</HI></P>
<P>THEY that desire to live long in this World, the best Course they can take for it is, to become <HI>practically</HI> Religious and Godly. Psal. 34.12. <HI>What man is he that desireth l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe, and loveth many days, let him depart from evil, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o good. Solomon</HI> therefore makes use of it as an <HI>Argument</HI> to perswade us to be Religi∣ous, Prov. 4.10. <HI>Hear, O my Son, and receive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y sayings, and the Years of thy Life shall be many.</HI></P>
<P>MANY a <HI>Young Convert</HI> has attain'd to the Character of an <HI>Old Disciple,</HI> as well as well as <HI>Mnason</HI> spoken of <HI>Acts</HI> 21.16. How ma∣ny of the Saints on Scripture Record, died in a good old Age? And we have some alive a∣mong <HI>Us</HI> at this day, who can say in <HI>Davids</HI> Words Psal. 71.17, 18. <HI>O God, thou hast taught <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e from my Youth and hitherto I have declared thy wondrous Works. And NOW I am old and gray-headed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="002256_0123_0FDADE29498DBD60"/>
BUT <HI>suppose</HI> you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Young, you may <HI>yet</HI> have a <HI>Sufficiency</HI> of Life? That Promise, Psal. 91.16. <HI>With long Life will I satisfy him, and shew him my Salvation,</HI> may be fulfill'd to one who dies in Youth. For it is the Nature of <HI>Grace</HI> to <HI>wean</HI> the Soul <HI>from</HI> this Life, to <HI>raise</HI> it <HI>above</HI> it, and to <HI>fix</HI> it <HI>upon</HI> another. <HI>Hence</HI> there have been found <HI>some</HI> Instances of gra∣cious <HI>Young Persons,</HI> who have been not only <HI>willing,</HI> but desirous and <HI>glad</HI> to leave this World. And he that has liv'd <HI>so</HI> long in this World, <HI>as</HI> to become fit for a better, and wil∣ling to leave this, He has liv'd <HI>long eno',</HI> and dies <HI>full of days.</HI></P>
<P>AND then, (if you be Gracious) the days you <HI>lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se</HI> on Earth, will be <HI>gain'd</HI> in Heaven; there you'l have <HI>Length of days for ever &amp; ever.</HI></P>
<P>Obj. VIII. IF I begin to be Religious now, it may be I shall not continue so: <HI>Many have Apostatized from good Beginnings;</HI> and it were <HI>better never to have known</HI> the Ways of God, than <HI>wickedly to depart</HI> from them.</P>
<P>I Answer,</P>
<P>THE <HI>Apostacy</HI> of some from good Begin∣nings has been very sad and awful. And Woe indeed to them who having <HI>beg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n in the Spirit</HI> do <HI>end in the Flesh!</HI> But this should not discourage nor deter you from entring upon the Ways of God; but only serve to take you off from <HI>Self-Confidence,</HI> and put you upon more humble and earnest seeking that <HI>Grace of God,</HI> which shall be able to make you stand, to <HI>con∣firm you unto the End.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="002256_0123_0FDADE29498DBD60"/>
THERE never was a <HI>true</HI> Convert, that <HI>to∣tally</HI> Apostat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>z'd. <HI>Being confident,</HI> says the A∣postle, <HI>of this very thing, that he which hath be∣gun a good Work in you, will perform it unto the day of Christ,</HI> Phil. 1.6.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Proverb</HI> that is so often in the Mouths of profane ones, <HI>A Young Saint</HI> makes <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> old Devil</HI> is false and malicious. No! The Young Saint will more likely prove an <HI>Angel</HI> when he is old in respect of <HI>excelling Knowledge and Sanctity.</HI></P>
<P>THE Young <HI>Hypocrite</HI> will prove an old <HI>A∣postate;</HI> but the <HI>serious</HI> Youth, the <HI>longer</HI> he exper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ences Religion, the <HI>better</HI> he will like it▪ and the <HI>closer</HI> he will stick to it. And the <HI>Grace</HI> of Christ, in him and with him, shall be <HI>sufficient</HI> to make him <HI>finally</HI> Victorious o∣ver all Difficulties, Temptations and Dangers.</P>
<P>Obj. IX. <HI>IT is time eno' for me to be Religious:</HI> I am <HI>Young,</HI> and have many <HI>Years</HI> before me.</P>
<P>THIS it may be, is the most <HI>common Objec∣tion,</HI> and prevails most on our <HI>Young People,</HI> to cause them to defer and put off the great Work of Religion and turning to God; and so would have requir'd a more full and large Answer to have been given to it, but that the <HI>happy Labours</HI> of my <HI>Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erend Brethren</HI> in the <HI>two Discourses</HI> immediately preceeding this, (wherein the <HI>Special Obligations</HI> to, and <HI>Pecu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Advantages</HI> of Early Religion are excel∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tly Argu'd with you) do spare me the Pains.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="002256_0124_0FDADE2A821E05D0"/>
I shall therefore only take the Liberty to ask you that make such an <HI>Objection</HI> as <HI>this,</HI> that it is <HI>I me eno'</HI> yet, two serious <HI>Questions.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>HOW know you that you shall have any o∣ther Time than this afforded you?</HI> Have you a∣ny <HI>Lease</HI> of your Lives? Have you made a <HI>Covenant with Death,</HI> and an <HI>Agreement with Hell,</HI> that you know shall stand▪ Is not the shortning and prolonging of your Life in the hand of God; of that God whom you can now so easily forget and neglect? Do not the <HI>most</HI> die Young? Are you not altogether Un∣certain when Death may be Commissioned by the Great God to fetch you out of this World? May you not be cut off while you <HI>presume</HI> upon hereafter? Don't you think that there are many now in the <HI>Chambers of utter Dark∣ness,</HI> who presum'd upon that hereafter which they never injoy'd?</P>
<P>METHINKS the <HI>Providence</HI> of God silences the <HI>Objection</HI> at this Time, when the <HI>Angel of Death</HI> stands with a drawn Sword over the <HI>Town,</HI> and threatens to <HI>come up into our Win∣dows, and enter into our Palaces, to cut off the Children from without, and the Young Men from the Streets.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Preach'd</HI> at a Time when the <HI>Small-Pox</HI> was got into the <HI>Town.</HI> A <HI>Distemper</HI> which (tho' frequent in other Places) is the <HI>Terror</HI> of us in <HI>New-England.</HI> Scarce a Quarter part of the <HI>Town</HI> ('tis tho't) have had it.

2. <HI>HOW can you expect to find Acceptance with God hereafter, if you neglect to seek and serve him now?</HI> The <HI>Hereafter</HI> you depend on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay never come; but if it should, is God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ound to accept you then?

<P>WE would not discourage the Repentance <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Endeavours of Sinners that are come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> last of their Time; and the <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD in CHRIST is such as may prevent a <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>al</HI> Despair <HI>then:</HI> But verily it is (as one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lls it) an <HI>Extraordinary Act of Sovereign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ivine Grace</HI> when such are accepted.</P>
<P>OH then! do not run <HI>all Hazards</HI> with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>espect to your Souls and another World, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you will do if you hearken to that Sug∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>estion, that it is <HI>Time eno' yet.</HI> But resolve <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y the Help of God, that you will not defer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tting about the Work of serious Religion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> longer.

Obj. X. IF I had a mind to be Religious, yet there are so many different Paths in Religion, that I should be <HI>at a loss</HI> which to take: some cry up <HI>this</HI> Way, others <HI>that,</HI> so that I know not <HI>which</HI> to choose &amp; fall in with.</P>
<P><HI>Ans.</HI> I am afraid they that <HI>Object</HI> after this Manner, only <HI>pretend</HI> the Differences in Re∣ligion to <HI>excuse</HI> their declining that which <HI>really</HI> they hate. For they are only the <HI>lesser</HI> Matters wherein Christians differ: And is it reasonable on the account of <HI>these</HI> to forsake those <HI>great</HI> and <HI>necessary</HI> things, wherein all are Agreed.</P>
<P>WE are not aiming, in our present Design, to bring you over to the Interests of a Party. No: <Q>The Piety which we <HI>principally</HI> press on our <HI>Young People,</HI> is, what all true Christi∣ans own to be necessary; what all Good Men tho' of different Perswasions on <HI>lesser</HI> Accounts, are United in, what all People when they come <HI>to Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> do advise, and com∣mend, and bear their Testimonies to.</Q></P>
<P>THE Use you should make then of these Differences in Religion, is not to throw of all Religion; but to be Inquisitive after Truth And for this End, you should diligently stu¦dy the <HI>Word</HI> of God, and humbly seek His <HI>Spirit</HI> to lead and guide you. I will add too, that you should not be backward to con¦sult and advise with the Faithful <HI>Minister<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of God. <HI>For the Priests lips should keep know¦ledge,
<PB N="31" REF="002256_0125_0FDADE2C1B6F9710"/>and they should seek the Law at his Mouth: for he is the Messenger of the Lord of Losts,</HI> Mal. 2.7. Your <HI>Ministers</HI> all of them, would be glad to afford you what Light, Direction, and Help they can; and I am sure you should not <HI>neglect</HI> them; to take Counsel, and receive Light, from those who may not be suppos'd <HI>so</HI> able to give it you, nor to have the <HI>like Concern</HI> for you, and that aim only to bring you over to their own <HI>Party</HI> and <HI>Interest.</HI></P>
<P>AS to what <HI>Way of Worship,</HI> and <HI>Form of Ministration</HI> you should attend on, I will only say this unto you; Choose <HI>that</HI> which (after humble Study and Prayer) you seri∣ously and conscienciously judge to come near∣est to the Holy Scriptures, (the only <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Standard</HI> of Faith and Practice) and the most likely to promote the <HI>Power</HI> of practical God∣liness in your Lives, and so the Salvation of your precious Souls in the End.</P>
<P>THUS I have made <HI>some Reply</HI> to the most Considerable <HI>Objections</HI> which any of you may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake against being Religious in your <HI>Youth∣ful Days.</HI> It had been easy to have carry'd these things the length of several <HI>Sermons,</HI> but I was willing to take up as few <HI>Pages</HI> as possible, and hope what has been offer'd may be <HI>sufficient</HI> for the present Purpose.</P>
<P><HI>CONSIDER now,</HI> DEAR YOUNG PEOPLE, <HI>of what has been said; and the LORD give you Understanding in all things!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="002256_0126_0FDADE2DA7464A70"/>
THE LORD help you over all the <HI>Blocks</HI> and <HI>Bars</HI> that lie in your Way; and by His <HI>special</HI> Grace, <HI>effectually</HI> determine your Thoughts and Hearts for Himself and Ser∣vice, and bring you into a <HI>serious</HI> and <HI>de∣lightful</HI> Walk in the Ways of Piety!</P>
<P>MAY you be so Wise, as Early to choose <HI>the good Part, which cannot be taken away</HI> and may your after <HI>Course</HI> be agreeable to your Early <HI>Choice!</HI> That so you may say in the End, as the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> Psal. 119.30, 31. <HI>I have chosen the Way of Truth. I have stuck un∣to thy Testimonies.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>E are still on the excellent Theme of <HI>Early Religion.</HI> In the Course of this Lec∣ture you have already had the <HI>Nature</HI> of early Piety defin'd, and the several <HI>Parts</HI> distinctly illustrated; the <HI>Obligati∣ons</HI> stated; the <HI>Advantages</HI> represented; and
<PB N="2" REF="002256_0127_0FDADE2F02D9E778"/>many <HI>Objections</HI> obviated. The Business now allotted <HI>Me</HI> (as the Conclusion of the whole Matter) is to make some Application or Improvement of the foregoing Discourses, in a Use of <HI>EXHORTATION</HI> and <HI>DIRECTION.</HI> And tho' indeed in <HI>Them</HI> there may have been offer'd Something of this Tendency; Yet if we consider the vast <HI>Weight,</HI> as well as <HI>Reach</HI> of the <HI>Argument,</HI> (together with the remain∣ing <HI>Cold, and careless Unconcern</HI> about it, visi∣ble in too Many of our <HI>Young People,</HI>) It will sufficiently appear, that the Task assign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <HI>Me</HI> is not a Pleonasm or superfluous Addition.</P>
<P>AS to the <HI>Passage</HI> of <HI>holy Scripture</HI> now read; I shall not stay in showing the Connexion, nor in opening the Contents hereof. It may suffice to say, We have here <HI>an Address to a Young Man,</HI> and <HI>an Exhortation</HI> to <HI>Early Piety.</HI> I have chosen the Words only as an agrea∣ble <HI>Foundation</HI> or decent <HI>Introduction</HI> to that part of the Subject, which falls to Me; and the Prosecution whereof I shall now imme∣diately apply my Self to.</P>
<P>THE Method, I propose to go in, is this;
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. I shall speak to the <HI>Secure</HI> and <HI>thoughtless Sinners</HI> among our Young People.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. TO the <HI>Thinking and Awakened.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>III. TO the <HI>Penitent and Regenerate.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I shall endeavour with all [decent] Plain∣ness of Speech, as far as I can, to adapt my Exhortations and Counsels to the respective
<PB N="3" REF="002256_0127_0FDADE2F02D9E778"/>Cases of each Rank; which being very un∣like, they call for a distinct Consideration and different Management.</P>
<P>THE <HI>first</HI> Sort of Young Persons to be ex∣horted are the habitually SECURE <HI>and Insensi∣ble.</HI> Too many (I'm afraid) there are of this un∣happy Character among our <HI>Young</HI> People, (as well as <HI>Elder,</HI>) notwithstanding the repeated solemn Calls, Warnings and Excitations they have had from time to time. Therefore there's <HI>Need</HI> of this Address to the <HI>Secure.</HI> And O that we might succeed in these our last At∣tempts!—</P>
<P>LET every unconcerned unconvinced Young Man now before the Lord, consider I am par∣ticularly speaking to Him, <HI>in the Name of GOD;</HI> that GOD who <HI>searches the Heart,</HI> who expects you <HI>take heed how you hear,</HI> and will one Day call you to an Account: In His great and dreadful Name (I say) I am now speaking to you. O consider this, <HI>Young Men &amp; Children,</HI> and dare not to <HI>turn away your Ear,</HI> nor <HI>harden your Heart:</HI> but hearken to the Voice of GOD, and <HI>see that ye refuse not Him that speaketh from Heaven.</HI> Hearken to the Counsel which is brought you, and send Us not back to our Master with that melancholy Complaint — <HI>Who hath believeth our Report? We have laboured in Vain.</HI>—Yet, be it so, <HI>our Judgment is with the Lord and our Reward with God!</HI></P>
<P>BUT, let me <HI>intreat</HI> you to <HI>suffer the Exhorta∣tion.</HI> Be perswaded then, <HI>Oh Sinner!</HI> to <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake off carnal Security,</HI> &amp; seek after religious Convictions.
<PB N="4" REF="002256_0128_0FDADE3442C240C8"/>Awake, Awake, O Sinner! Awake, Thou Slug∣gard! Rise from thy Bed of Sloth. How long wilt thou slumber? Wilt thou not bethink &amp; bestir thyself? <HI>When shall it once be?</HI> O Sinner, open thine eyes to behold the Light; open thine Ear to Discipline. Rise out of the Dust, shake thy self, and no longer fold thine Hands to Sleep. Do this now, my Brother, and deliver thy self; <HI>Give not sleep to thine Eyes, nor slumber to thine Eye-lids. Escape for thy Life;</HI> Escape to the Mountain, lest thou be consum∣ed. Deliver thy self as a Roe from the Hand of the Hunter, and as a Bird from the Snare of the Fowler. Go to the Ant, thou Sluggard, consider her ways, and be wise. <HI>Awake thou that s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, and arise from the Dead.</HI> Knowing the Time, that now it is high time to awake our of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eep, therefore cast off the works of Darkness.—</P>
<P>BUT (as the Prophet speaks, Jer. 6.10, 11.) <HI>To whom shall I speak and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>arken: Behold, the Word of the Lord is unto them a Reproach; they have no Delight in it!</HI> And indeed when I consider how powerful an Orator <HI>Satan</HI> is, and how great the <HI>Deceitfulness of Sin,</HI> and the infatu∣ation of <HI>Self Love;</HI>—I am almost tempted, in Despair of Success, to desist from the present Attempt to awaken the Secure; and to break off in the words of the <HI>Prophet</HI> aforesaid,—<HI>I am full of the fury of the Lord, I am weary with h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lding in; I will pour it out upon the Children
<PB N="5" REF="002256_0128_0FDADE3442C240C8"/>abroad, and upon the assembly of Young Men to∣gether.</HI>—</P>
<P>BUT when I consider again the <HI>Wisdom</HI> and the <HI>Power</HI> of CHRIST (whose Embassadors we are, and on whose Blessing we have leave to depend for Prosperity in our sincere Endea∣vours,) my <HI>Hopes revive;</HI> and I can't but re∣assume, and proceed in His Name &amp; Strength to press the Exhortation. And O! that He, who can <HI>make dry Bones live,</HI> wou'd now breath in his Word; and speak to the <HI>Heart</HI> &amp; <HI>Con∣science</HI> of every one, while the Word is sound∣ing in your Ears.</P>
<P>BUT what Arguments and Expressions shall I chuse? O that I might be directed to such, as shall affect and penetrate deep! GOD is our Witness, whom we serve in the Gospel of His Son, that our Hearts Desire and Prayer for you all is, that you may be saved.—<HI>Now therefore, as tho' God did beseech you by Us, we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God: And as workers together with Him we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eseech you, that ye receive not the Gospel of God in vain.</HI> In the Bowels of JESUS, and by all the Compassion you owe to your perishing Souls, we beg you, yea we <HI>command and exhort by our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> that you <HI>now,</HI> even now without any further Delay, bethink your selves; and let such Considerations as these, which follow, be of weight with you, (if the hardness of your Hearts will permit your tak∣ing them in,) to hasten your seeking after sound Convictions.—I shall endeavour
<PB N="6" REF="002256_0129_0FDADE36251AB7E0"/>only to <HI>hint</HI> Things, a <HI>few</HI> Things; and leave you to enlarge on them in your retir'd Me∣ditations: because otherwise I forsee I shall be tedious.</P>
<P N="1">I. Then, <HI>CONSIDER the great</HI> SINFULNESS <HI>of your present Security.</HI> Great is your wickedness herein; your Guilt is very <HI>obvious</HI> and <HI>prodigi∣ous.</HI> Your carnal Security implies the black∣est Ingratitude, the basest Disingenuity, the vilest Injustice, Rebellio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and Presumption. It bewrays a secret Infidelity, and proceeds from accursed Principles. It is a manifest Disobedience to the preceptive Will of God. It is a slighting the Threatnings of His Law, a contemning the Promises of His Gospel; and opposing the gracious Designs of His Word and Ordinances and Providences. It is a high Contempt cast on the blessed GOD; 'tis a dishonourable Reflection on His Wisdom and Love in CHRIST; 'tis a Reproaching His Justice, Holiness and Truth; 'tis a Defiance to His Infinite Power; an abuse of His Mercy, and a mocking of His Patience! 'tis an inso∣lent spurning at His Favour, neglecting His Service, misimploying the Time and Talents. He has given you, and a preferring the Devil before Him.—Further, It is a denying the Lord that bought you, and trampling under foot the Son of God. It is also a resisting the Holy Ghost, and doing Despite to the Spirit of Grace.</P>
<P>YOUR Security then is a heinous Iniquity.
<PB N="7" REF="002256_0129_0FDADE36251AB7E0"/>And what's an unspeakable Aggravation here∣of, it immoveably fastens upon you the Guilt of all your other Sins. O secure <HI>Young Man,</HI> labour to see what horrible Guilt lies upon you! And let the Time past suffice to have been spent in this dreadful Wickedness. Now <HI>awake to Righteousness, and sin not.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>CONSIDER the absolute</HI> INEXCUSABLENESS <HI>of your sinful Security.</HI> You have no Plea in the World to cover your Guilt. Your Se∣curity is <HI>willful</HI> and <HI>chosen.</HI> It is against ma∣ny Calls and Cautions both in the Word and Providence of God; you can't therefore plead, you have not been duly <HI>warn'd</HI> and <HI>called;</HI> God and Men are Witnesses to this—You can't plead invincible <HI>Ignorance</HI> of the way of Salvation, the necessity of Conversion, the need of Convictions, and the methods in order hereto: for Light is come into the World, and you <HI>chuse</HI> Darkness.—You can't plead insuperable <HI>Difficulties</HI> in the way: for Grace is offer'd, Grace sufficient; and you <HI>re∣fuse</HI> it.—You can't pretend <HI>want of Encou∣ragement;</HI> for great and precious Promises are set before you. — You can't pre∣tend <HI>want of Helps</HI> to assist you; For you have all needful Means of Conviction and Awaken∣ing. — You can't have the Face to pretend <HI>want of Leisure;</HI> that you have <HI>no Time</HI> to attend the necessary care of your Soul; <HI>being engag'd in other matters of higher Importance;</HI> For there is nothing of equal or comparable
<PB N="8" REF="002256_0130_0FDADE377A142DE8"/>Moment with that: or <HI>being as a Servant in a continual Hurry of Care and Employment, and not at your own dispose:</HI> for you <HI>may,</HI> you <HI>shou'd</HI> in this <HI>Case, redeem Time</HI> from your <HI>Bed</HI> and <HI>Table,</HI> and otherwise; as knowing you have a Master in Heaven whose Service must not be dispensed with on any score whatever. — You can't be so absurd as to pretend any <HI>Unfitness</HI> of the <HI>present Time,</HI> or say that you are <HI>too Young,</HI> to concern your self about the grave Matters of Religion: For that which is at <HI>all Times</HI> your indispensable <HI>Duty,</HI> and so necessary to your <HI>present</HI> (as as well as future) <HI>Safety</HI> and <HI>Comfort,</HI> can't be begun too soon. Besides, How many <HI>Others</HI> no fitter by Na∣ture nor riper in Years than you, have <HI>early sought</HI> and <HI>aright improv'd</HI> Convictions, to their saving Repentance? — <HI>What then will you say, when God shall arise?</HI> How wilt thou answer it, O <HI>Young Man,</HI> when God shall bring thee into Judgment, that thou hast not remember'd thy Creator in the days of thy Youth, but walked in the ways of thine own Heart, and in the sight of thine Eyes? Verily you have <HI>no Clok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for your Sin.</HI> Every Mouth shall be stopt. Behold, <HI>Heaven, Earth,</HI> and <HI>Hell</HI> shall bear Record against you; yea <HI>your own Cons∣cience</HI> will be instead of a Thousand Witnesses, and strike you into silence and confusion. <Q>Whoever remains <HI>Graceless</HI> in the Day of Grace, will be found <HI>Speechless</HI> in the Day of Judgment.</Q></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="9" REF="002256_0130_0FDADE377A142DE8"/>
3. <HI>CONSIDER the extream</HI> FOLLY <HI>of your present Security,</HI> and the <HI>Madness</HI> of <HI>Continuing</HI> therein. O how unreasonable is it! 'Tis a <HI>Prodigy</HI> of Madness, as well as Wickedness. He is unworthy the <HI>Name</HI> of a <HI>Man,</HI> that al∣lows himself in it. O that you cou'd see what a sottish, stupid, blind &amp; mad Thing it is! I have not Words or Thoughts big enough to reach the Height of this Folly. Your carnal Security and Ease is most irrational and ab∣surd in it's <HI>Nature, Grounds</HI> and <HI>Motives.</HI> It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s an open Contradiction to all genuine Prin∣ciples of Reason, an offering Violence to all the Laws of Prudence and the Dictates of re∣gular Self-love. He might well be call'd a <HI>Fool,</HI> who said to himself, <HI>Soul, Take thine Ease.</HI>— Let me here offer a few Hints, to il∣lusttrate this Point a little.</P>
<P>YOUR Security is unreasonable, in that it is <HI>without all Ground;</HI> or stands on a <HI>deceitful</HI> Bottom. It is chiefly owing to careless <HI>Inad∣vertence,</HI> or wild <HI>Presumption,</HI> or wicked <HI>Infi∣delity.</HI> Your present Ease and Quiet is alto∣gether false and delusive. It is mere Forgery and Fiction; a lying Vanity, and empty shew of Peace: And is as different from true solid Rest of Soul, as a killing Lethargy from the sweet and refreshing Sleep of Health: And at best it is but for a Moment. O the stupi∣dity then of your beloved Dreams!</P>
<P>BUT your <HI>Folly</HI> will be more glaring, if we consider what a MISERABLE <HI>State</HI> it is you are secure and easy in. Your <HI>Misery is great upon
<PB N="10" REF="002256_0131_0FDADE38C9395BD0"/>you.</HI> The Miseries of your present State are <HI>dreadful</HI> and <HI>astonishing.</HI> You are at a <HI>Distance</HI> from the Blessed GOD, and are under His <HI>Wrath</HI> and <HI>Curse,</HI> in your Person and Enjoy∣ments and all the Work of your Hands. — You are at <HI>War with</HI> GOD, in an active, as well as passive Sense: <HI>The carnal Mind in you is Enmity against God.</HI> — And you are at <HI>War</HI> with your <HI>selves;</HI> innumerable hurtful Lusts are in you, which war against the Soul, and with one another. And you are under the vilest <HI>Servitude</HI> and <HI>Bondage;</HI> possessed by the Devil, chained down to the Earth, and sold under Sin. You are also in a State of the utmost <HI>Poverty and Indigence.</HI> It was the just Charac∣ter of secure Laodicea and belongs to you. Rev. 3.17. <HI>Thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</HI> You have no Interest in GOD as your Portion, in CHRIST as your Redeemer, in the Holy SPIRIT as your Comforter: You are without <HI>Grace, Mercy, and Peace,</HI> at present and without all Right to <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> hereafter. — And (which exceedingly <HI>aggravates</HI> all your Mise∣ries) You are altogether <HI>unable</HI> to deliver yourself out of this deplorable Condition; and are also <HI>UNWILLING to accept of Deliverance.</HI> O amazing Stupidity and Indolence this! What a Riddle is here? <HI>Senseless</HI> and quiet under such a <HI>pressing Load</HI> of Evils! <HI>Hear O Heavens; and be astonished O Earth!</HI> Surely thou art more foolish than the Beast that hath no understanding and hast not the Know∣ledge
<PB N="11" REF="002256_0131_0FDADE38C9395BD0"/>of a Man: To la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>guish away an in∣sensible Life in such a Miserable State! No∣thing <HI>more unreasonable!</HI> Nothing <HI>so unaccoun∣table!</HI></P>
<P>EXCEPT it be, that you are <HI>fearless</HI> amidst innumerable DANGERS that threaten you; which are as <HI>awful,</HI> as the Miseries actually present are <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrowfu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>;</HI> and call for the most awaken'd Resentment and Horror. Oh what a <HI>dark and dreadful Prospect</HI> is there before you, secure Sinner! God has threatn'd to <HI>punish the Men that are at Ease from their Youth and settled on their Lees.</HI> — You are daily liable to, and may well expect, OUTWARD and <HI>tempo∣ral</HI> Judgments, which may soon end or much embitter your Life; for the whole Creation is armed against you: And tho' through infi∣nite Divine Patience you may prosper in your Wickedness, yet this will be only in Judg∣ment, and for a Moment.</P>
<P>BUT you are especially in danger of SPIRI∣TUAL Miseries. Your Security exposes you to all manner of <HI>Snares</HI> and Temptations to <HI>Sin</HI> the most gross and criminal; and even <HI>invites</HI> your subtil <HI>Enemy</HI> to take advantage hereby to pursue his malicious Designs, to your eter∣nal Ruin. Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over you are in danger of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sing</HI> the <HI>Means</HI> of Grace, at least the saving <HI>benefit</HI> of Them. Yea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> if you voluntarily and studiously r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>main Secure, you are in dan∣ger of being <HI>finally abandoned of GOD,</HI> judicially ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>den<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>; and so of growing worse and worse under the Means of Goodness. Abundance of
<PB N="12" REF="002256_0132_0FDADE3A52C20850"/>sad <HI>Examples</HI> hereof Scripture and Observati∣on afford us.</P>
<P>FINALLY Remember, You are in hourly danger of ETERNAL Miseries. Beyond and af∣ter all the former Evils, there are <HI>unknown</HI> Plagues in Reserve for unregenerate Sinners in the coming World, which you are every moment in the utmost Hazard of. If you die unconvinc'd and impenitent, you will imme∣diately be <HI>punish'd with an Everlasting Destruction from the Presence of the Lord.</HI> And <HI>die</HI> you will <HI>shortly:</HI> You may die in <HI>Youth;</HI> you may die <HI>speedily,</HI> perhaps <HI>suddenly,</HI> without Warn∣ing and without Relief. You have abundant <HI>Reason</HI> to <HI>fear</HI> lest this be your dreadful Por∣tion: For it is what the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD <HI>threa∣tens</HI> to rebellious obstinate Sinners. Prov. 29.1. <HI>He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroy'd, and that with∣out remedy.</HI> And the <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD is ever and anon presenting us with aw∣ful <HI>Executions</HI> of this Threatning upon <HI>others:</HI> And <HI>you</HI> may reasonably ex∣pect the <HI>same</HI> Treatment from vindictive Justice. It is a wonder of infinite Patience that you have been spar'd <HI>hitherto:</HI> But how much longer Divine Compassion will reprieve you, is an Uncertainty of trembling conside∣ration. And if you should (as you have Ground to fear you shall,) be snatch'd away <HI>unex∣pectedly,</HI> and hurl'd down <HI>suddenly</HI> into the horrible Pit and devouring Fire, how will the sad <HI>Surprize</HI> amazingly <HI>aggravate</HI> your fearful
<PB N="13" REF="002256_0132_0FDADE3A52C20850"/>Doom; even as the Mid-night Cry is the more terrible to Us, as we start out of a pleasant Dream!</P>
<P>NOW <HI>reflect</HI> on these Things, O secure Sin∣ner! Think of the awful <HI>Hazards</HI> you incur: and see your egregious. <HI>Folly.</HI> Surely <HI>Madness is in thy Heart!</HI> Were you not <HI>blinded by the God of this World</HI> and under the power of strong Delusions, methinks, it <HI>cou'd not be</HI> that you shou'd thus <HI>despise your own Soul,</HI> and ex∣pose your self to such <HI>dreadful Risques.</HI> How <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad</HI> were it in a Man to <HI>sleep</HI> carelesly on the <HI>Top of a Mast,</HI> or <HI>the Brink of a Precipice!</HI> Much more is it in <HI>you</HI> to indulge your guilty Slumbers, over the <HI>Flames of Hell,</HI> and under the loud <HI>Thunders of Heaven.</HI> It is Folly in the <HI>Exaltation,</HI> thus to sleep in the midst of so <HI>many</HI> and <HI>such</HI> Dangers. Surely such deserve the Character of <HI>Sottish Children;</HI> and you may well lie down in your shame, and Con∣fusion cover you, when you think of your astonishing Stupidity and Temerity; which declares you more foolish than the silliest Worm, that by a natural Instinct studies Self-preservation.</P>
<P>REMEMBER, it is one <HI>Point of Prudence</HI> to take a <HI>Prospect</HI> of <HI>Futurities,</HI> to view Things in their last Result as well as present Aspect: and 'tis a Maxim of Wisdom, that <HI>Evils</HI> in <HI>Reversion</HI> (however distant) do challenge the same notice and should alike affect us, as if actually present. Hence the Wise Man ob∣serves, Prov. 22.3. <HI>A prudent Person foreseeth
<PB N="14" REF="002256_0133_0FDADE40F7A6F6A8"/>the evil and hideth himself: but the simple pass on and are punished.</HI> It is the Folly and Ruin of ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y Young People, that they are so easily de∣ceiv'd with <HI>present Appearances,</HI> &amp; will not look forward to the <HI>End</HI> of Things; will not realize future Dangers, and govern themselves by the serious Thoughts of Invisible Realities.</P>
<P>REMEMBER, It is a <HI>Point of Prudence</HI> to improve the <HI>first</HI> convenient Season for the accomplishing Affairs of <HI>Weight</HI> and Necessity; and not to <HI>forego</HI> a <HI>present</HI> Opportunity on the presumption of another or better <HI>here∣after.</HI> But now, how <HI>contrary</HI> to this Principle is the Conduct of secure Sinners? It is certain, <HI>Repentance</HI> is a matter of absolute <HI>Necessity;</HI> which must be seasonably minded, or you are undone for ever. And you are sure of no Season but the present. And yet how do you let slip one Opportunity after another? You <HI>will</HI> sleep on securely to day and defer till to morrow, tho' you can't promise your selves to live 'till then. On what Distraction is it thus to depend on a remote possibility, and venture your everlasting Concerns on so great an Uncertainty!</P>
<P>REMEMBER, It is a <HI>Point of Prudence</HI> to chuse the <HI>fittest</HI> Seasons. And now as to the Work of Repentance, the Time of <HI>Youth,</HI> the <HI>present</HI> Time is the <HI>best</HI> Opportunity for it. By an <HI>Early</HI> Conversion the great <HI>Ends</HI> of Re∣pentance are <HI>most promoted,</HI> which are the Glo∣ry of God, and our own Peace and Welfare. This Thought shou'd animate you to an early
<PB N="15" REF="002256_0133_0FDADE40F7A6F6A8"/>seeking a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ter Conviction which is a necessary Medium to Conversion. The Reasons that shou'd move you to seek Convictions at all have the same Force now as ever to engage you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay are more obliging now in the Days of your Youth.</P>
<P>IN the Time of <HI>Youth</HI> Convictions are <HI>to be attain'd</HI> with greater <HI>Facility. Youth</HI> is the Age of Discipline and Tractableness, and Ten∣derness. Now natural Conscience is m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st wakeful and sensible and the Strivings of the Spirit ordinarily most effectual. Now you are clogged with fewer Impediments, and so Convictions will have easier Admission.</P>
<P>AND besides at <HI>this Age</HI> your Convictions will be <HI>lighter and more easily borne.</HI> If Repentance be <HI>delay'd,</HI> you will not be brought to it with∣out <HI>more</HI> Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s and Groans; <HI>more</HI> Tears, and Terrors. The longer you sleep in carnal Se∣curity, the opening of your Eyes will grow more Difficult, and the Scene more terrible; <Q>more of Hell must be flasht in your Face, and there will be more amazing Aggravati∣ons of Sin to rack the Conscience,</Q> and rend the Heart; and consequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y <HI>greater Horrors will tak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hold of you.</HI> The Stings of Sin will be more in Number and greater in Smart; the wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds of Spirit deeper and the workings of Conscience more violent after∣wards than in Youth. Delays will not mol∣lify the Anguish but double the Torment of painful Convictions. It is wretched <HI>f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly</HI> then to let go the <HI>present</HI> Season: It is contrary
<PB N="16" REF="002256_0134_0FDADE41C9489E10"/>to right <HI>Reason</HI> which teaches us the <HI>Wisdom of Prevention;</HI> and forbids our doing that, (however grateful at present,) which will lay a Foundation for after-Sorrow and Regret. How great then is your <HI>Madness,</HI> O Sinner, in that by your present Security in the days of Youth, you are <HI>making Work for a bitter Repentance</HI> hereafter, and taking an unhappy Method to render your Conversion more dolo∣rous and difficult, if you do at length obtain Mercy.</P>
<P>AGAIN, If Convictions are betimes begu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and entertain'd, the work will <HI>sooner be over.</HI> Ordinarily <HI>Young</HI> Converts are not so long as others under preparatory Terrors. As the A∣gonies of the New-Birth in such are more <HI>tolerable;</HI> so they are more <HI>transient,</HI> and such have <HI>fewer After pains.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Things abundantly show that the <HI>Time of Youth</HI> is the <HI>special</HI> Season for <HI>Repen∣tance.</HI> Don't <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en put it off on the vain Dream of a more convenient Opportunity hereafter. <HI>Behold now is the Day of Salvation.</HI> Be wise therefore and improve the present Day, for the seeking Convictions. Perhaps (as you've heard) this may be your <HI>only</HI> Op∣portunity: But supposing it may be so, yet surely it is the <HI>best.</HI> The <HI>present</HI> Season is attended with peculiar <HI>Advantages:</HI> And there are no <HI>Objections</HI> occurring <HI>now,</HI> but what will <HI>equally</HI> lie against a future Season; when it becomes present; nay will then be much <HI>enhaunced</HI> and more invincibly embarrass you.

<P>TO Such (I say) I wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d offer a few Words by way of <HI>Counsel</HI> and <HI>Direction.</HI></P>

<P><PB N="19" REF="002256_0135_0FDADE4345F56018"/>
LET Me <HI>caution</HI> you to beware of all the <HI>Causes of Security,</HI> and Impediments of Awa∣kening. Watch against every Thing that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ends to nourish Sloth, and to prevent your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esiring, or Obtaining Convictions. You must learn the Causes of Security, and not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnorant of the Devices of Satan: You must watch and guard against them.</P>
<P>TAKE Heed then of <HI>affected Ignorance.</HI> It <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s the Ruin of Many, They shut their Eyes a∣gainst the Light that shines about Them, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rn away their Face; whereby their foolish heart is darkned, and Satan keeps his Goods <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> peace.—Beware of <HI>false Reasonings</HI> and <HI>Pre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ices.</HI> Shut your Ears against all the Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ls and Objections of an evil Heart of Unbe∣lief, which is Enmity against GOD, and is not subject to his Law. Take heed you don't entertain wrong and abusive Apprehensions concerning GOD; as being full of Revenge and inexorable; which will tend to damp all Thoughts of a Reconciliation; or as so full Grace and Pity that He can't be dispos'd to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>amn His own Creatures, however Sinful; which will tend to harden you from the Fear of GOD. Beware of Misconceptions concern∣ing CHRIST; as if His Satisfaction had taken <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>way the Obligation of the Moral Law as a Rule, remov'd the Necessity of Repentance and Personal Obedience, and purchased a Dispen∣sation for Wickedness.—Beware of light Thoughts of <HI>Sin,</HI> as not being so evil, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tensive to GOD, as 'tis represented.—Take <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed of loose Thoughts about the <HI>Scriptures</HI>

<P>FURTHER, Beware of deceiving your self with a <HI>comparative Righteousness.</HI> Young Peo¦ple are very apt to take the measure of their own worth on Religious accounts (as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> others) from such as are inferior to them; and to swell in their own Conceit when they be¦hold others more prophane and wicked tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> themselves.

Illumination is a necessary Antecedent to Convictions; tho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Conviction be not a necessary Consequent of That; For alas, many very knowing Professors, yea Preachers of the Gospel, are real Slaves of Satan: yet none can become the true Ser∣vants of GOD without Christian Knowledge. You must therefore endeavour to get acquain∣ted with the Things of your Peace, and know the Mysteries of Godliness. You must lear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to know <HI>your own Selves;</HI> what you were a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> first created in <HI>Adam,</HI> what you are since A∣postate; what you are still capable of being.

What is the Reason, that in times of Sickness or imminent Hazard, Conscience recovers some sense, Sinners are more concern'd than at other Times, and Fearfulness surprizes the Hypocrite?

<P><PB N="24" REF="002256_0138_0FDADE519009CDF0"/>
Truths Weight and Warmth, and applies them wirh power to the Soul; and is the leading step towards Conversion.</P>
<P>LET Young People be perswaded then to give themselves to <HI>Meditation.</HI> Learn to fix your Thoughts and contract a Habit of Think∣ing, sober serious Thinking. With the Reason that becomes Men, &amp; the Sollicitude that becomes Sinners, set your selves to meditate on Divine &amp; Spiritual things; especially <HI>those Truths which most tend to awaken you to Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>O think on the Guilt, Pollution, and Mise∣ry of your natural State. Think on the Evil of Sin in its Nature and Consequences. Think on the Sins of your past Lives; consider 'em in their Quality, Number, and aggravating Circumstances. Think on the infallible Know∣lege, infinite Purity, and inflexible Truth, al∣mighty Power and exact Righteousness of that GOD, whom you have provoked by your Sins. Think on the Reasonableness and Per∣fection of His Precepts, the Dreadfulness of the Threatnings and Greatness of the Promi∣ses annext thereunto. Think on your abso∣lute Inability to fulfil the Law, to expiate for Sin, or endure the Curse. Think on the bles∣sed Provision, made for you in JESUS CHRIST. Think on the Greatness of the Salvation pur∣chased by CHRIST, and proposed in the Gos∣pel; the Freeness and Grace of the Offer; the Condescention of the Terms; and the Assistance tender'd you. Think how much it
<PB N="25" REF="002256_0138_0FDADE519009CDF0"/>cost the Son of GOD, even His own most pre∣cious Blood, to procure this Redemption for you. Think much of CHRIST and Him cru∣cify'd, of CHRIST and Him glorify'd. Think particularly on the Agonies of His Soul, which was exceeding sorrowful even unto Death; under a Sense of Sin and Apprehension of the Wrath of GOD; and endeavour after some I∣mitation hereof. — Meditate on the Vanity and Meanness of all Earthly Things. Think on the Certainty and Awfulness of approach∣ing Death, Judgment and Eternity. Think on the Glories and Joys of Heaven; the Miseries and Pains of Hell: And the infinite Folly you are guilty of in not taking a timely Care to secure the Former, and avoid the Latter.</P>
<P>THESE are some of the Things, which you should meditate upon, and a due Considera∣tion whereof wou'd have a rational Tendency to impress your hard Heart and awaken you out of your sleepy Insensibility.</P>
<P>O Sinner, I beseech you then, Think on these Things sadly in the fear of GOD. <HI>Set your Heart unto all these Things, give thy self wholly to them.</HI> Let your Meditations be vo∣luntary and chosen, free and unconstrain'd. Let them also be leasurely, frequent, &amp; solemn. <HI>Take Time and take Pains,</HI> and be diligent in the Work.</P>
<P>THIS is a Duty of <HI>vast Importance;</HI> and therefore must not be trifled in, much less neglected. This also is what you have a <HI>na∣tural Capacity</HI> for. You <HI>can</HI> thus meditate if
<PB N="26" REF="002256_0139_0FDADE47C7F18608"/>you will. You don't want Ability; nor do you want Opportunity. And this is the <HI>best Use</HI> of your thinking Powers. Your Thoughts are generally buisy: And what can you em∣ploy them about, that is of greater Weight or Value than the Subjects before mention'd? Your Minds are very apt indeed to run upon your worldly Affairs, Pleasures, Profits, Ho∣nours, Friends, &amp;c. But alas! how foolish are you in this? Since those <HI>other</HI> Meditations, recommended above, are incomparably <HI>more necessary, excellent, delightful,</HI> and <HI>beneficial:</HI> And in themselves are no greater Toil and Labour.</P>
<P>WHAT <HI>Excuse</HI> then can you frame? What Pretence to palliate your Neglect of holy spi∣ritual Meditation? Verily thou art <HI>inexcusa∣ble,</HI> O Man, whoever thou art, that livest in the omission hereof. Be exhorted then, to dismiss your vain Thoughts with shame and Regret for them; and to overcome your natu∣ral Aversion to spiritual Meditation, and spee∣dily set about this great Work. <HI>O that I cou'd perswade you THIS NIGHT to retire and spend a little Moment in serious. Debates with your own Heart on the Sin and Folly of present De∣lays in the Affairs of your Soul!</HI> And hence∣forward to accustom your self, now and then to separate some small Portion of your Time [tho' 'twere but a few Minutes in a Day] in solemn Consideration of some awakening Truths; possibly this might be blessed to your saving Conviction: And methinks, <HI>This</HI> were
<PB N="27" REF="002256_0139_0FDADE47C7F18608"/>but an <HI>inconsiderable</HI> Thing to do for your <HI>Soul.</HI> —There can be no rational Expectation of your thorough Awakening, 'till you can be brought to sober Thinking. But if I cou'd persuade you to this, (so necessary, so cheap, so reasonable a Duty,) and you wou'd engage in it in Earnest, it wou'd be a hopeful Omen of your Conversion. <Q>O therefore deny not this much to <HI>you self,</HI> deny it not to <HI>GOD,</HI> if you will deny it me. I have told the Truth: <HI>Consider what I say, and the Lord give you understanding!</HI> 2 Tim. 2.7. or if you put me to conclude in harsher Terms, they shall be still the <HI>Oracles of GOD.</HI> Psal. 50.22. <HI>Now consider this ye that forget GOD, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to de∣liver.</HI></Q></P>
<P>AND so much for the <HI>Second</HI> Direction; which I have been the longer upon, because of it's singular Importance in the present Case.</P>
<P N="3">3. YOU must with great Industry &amp; Care <HI>improve all proper</HI> OUTWARD HEL<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s and MEANS, <HI>conducible to Spiritual Conviction.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) WITH a view to this End, Diligently <HI>read the Holy Scriptures, and other pious Books.</HI> Don't mispend your Time and endanger your Soul by conversing with idle, leud, prophane Authors; which tends only to exalt Folly and alienate you more from the Life of God. But read Religious Composures; Books of Devotion, practical Sermons, pious Lives, &amp;c. particularly <HI>such as are most suited to the
<PB N="28" REF="002256_0140_0FDADE504833E250"/>Case of the Secure.</HI> Chuse with Caution: Peruse with Deliberation &amp; Diligence.</P>
<P>MORE especially be conversant with the blessed BIBLE. Give your self to reading in the Law of the Lord, which is perfect, con∣verting the Soul, making wise the simple. Read your Bible frequently; Look into it Day &amp; Night; and that with a reachable and obedient Spirit: with attentive Conside∣ration: with firm Belief: and a wise Appli∣cation of what you read, to your own Soul, by way of Trial &amp; of Charge.— Observe these Directions in Reading your Bible; and this will probably be a successful Means of your Awakening. The Apostle tells <HI>Timothy,</HI> who from a <HI>Child had known the Holy Scriptures,</HI> that they are <HI>profitable for Doctrine, for Con∣viction, for Correction; and able to make men wise to Salvation,</HI> (2 Tim. 3.15, 16.)</P>
<P N="2">(2.) ATTEND on the <HI>Publick Ministry of the Word.</HI> The common <HI>Catechism</HI> (that ex∣cellent Form of sound Words which you will do well to study much, and ought to hold fast in Faith and Love; This, I say,) teaches you, <Q>that the SPIRIT of GOD maketh the Read∣ing, but <HI>especially the Preaching,</HI> of the Word an effectual means of Convincing and Converting Sinners.</Q>—The Truth of which Doctrine has been (thro' the Riches of Divine Grace) confirmed in innumerable Instances.— <HI>Attend then on the Word Preached.</HI> Look on the Publick Ministry, as a Divine Institution.
<PB N="29" REF="002256_0140_0FDADE504833E250"/>Realize the special Presence of GOD with His faithful Ministers. Let every one so account of them as of the <HI>Embassadors of Christ,</HI> and <HI>Stewards of the Mysteries of God:</HI> and when they speak according to the Law and to the Testimony, receive their Message not as the Word of Man, but as (what it is indeed) the Word of GOD.—Let me here advise you, to be <HI>careful</HI> (tho' not too <HI>curious</HI>) in the Choice of the Ministry, you commit your Self to the Conduct of. Beware of an <HI>Ignorant</HI> Ministry; or a Ministry that is merely <HI>Speculative;</HI> or that is <HI>Superficial,</HI> and at best only throws a few Squibbs at grosser Sins, but seldom (if ever) touches on more hidden spiritual Sins; nor attempts to lay open the Misery, Guilt and Danger of a Natural state, and show Sinners their need of CHRIST for Righte∣ousness &amp; Strength, &amp;c. Chuse not a Ministry of either of these dangerous Characters. But fix your self under a Skilful and Orthodox, a Godly and Experienc'd, a Practical Scriptural and Searching Ministry; which preaches JESUS CHRIST, and shuns not to declare the whole Counsel of GOD, and studies to commend itself to every Man's Conscience in the sight of GOD.</P>
<P>AND having <HI>chosen</HI> well, also <HI>improve</HI> well. Be swift to hear; and take heed <HI>how</HI> (as well as <HI>whom</HI>) you hear. Attend with Constancy, Reverence and Diligence, as an humble Lear∣ner. Lay aside all superfluity of naughtiress: and receive with meekness the ingraffed Word, which is able to save your Soul. Receive
<PB N="30" REF="002256_0141_0FDADE531D5B7508"/>the Truth in the Love of it; Mix the Word with Faith; Hide it in your Heart, and labour to press it on Conscience, both in the hearing, and afterwards.</P>
<P>UNDER the Conduct of these Rules make Use of the Word preach'd, as instrumental of Conviction &amp; Repentance; and it may be 'twill <HI>work effectually</HI> in you; as it did in them, of whom we read, in 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.13.</P>
<P N="3">(3.) ENDEAVOUR to improve <HI>Awakening Providences</HI> for this End. Thus, Are you un∣der Afflictions <HI>your self?</HI> Labour to get your Heart suitably affected. Don't set God's Judgments at defiance, nor harden your self against Discipline. <HI>Solomon</HI> sometimes ob∣serves, that <HI>the Rod gives Wisdom.</HI> And <HI>Elihu</HI> before him; <HI>If they be bound in Fetters, and be holden in cords of Affliction: then he sheweth <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hem their Work and their Transgressions, that they have exceeded. He openeth also their Ear unto Discipline, and commandeth that they return from Iniquity.</HI>— Afflictions by a natural Effi∣cacy tend to soften &amp; humble. When GOD's Hand is upon you then, take this Opportuni∣ty to press after Convictions. In the Day of Adversity consider. Hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it. Receive Correction; set in with Providence, and work together with GOD. Thus <HI>Manasseh,</HI> &amp; thus the <HI>Prodigal Son</HI> improved their outward Afflictions to their inward Humiliation &amp; Repentance.</P>
<P>LET me add here; Observe, &amp; Study to
<PB N="31" REF="002256_0141_0FDADE531D5B7508"/>affect your self with the <HI>Death</HI> of other Young People; and the sad Outcries of the Impeni∣tent in their last Moments. Look on what befalls others, as a Warning &amp; Call from Hea∣ven to you, &amp; let it strike an Awe upon you.— Let the <HI>Sudden</HI> Deaths which you have seen or heard of at any Time alarm your Fears and rouze you out of your Security.— And when it is a Time of <HI>Spreading Mortality,</HI> when Death rides in Triumph in our Streets, <HI>(and GOD only knows how near such an awful Season may be!)</HI> This is a loud Summons to every One; especially to <HI>Young People</HI> who are most exposed to Infectious Diseases; a loud Call (I say) This is to Us to turn unto Him that smiteth. We should wisely observe, resent, &amp; improve such Dispensations; and study to affect our Hearts, that we may trem∣ble at the Arm of the LORD stretched out and humble our selves under His mighty Hand. This GOD expects. See <HI>Joel</HI> 2.1, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="4">(4.) ANOTHER good Help to be made Use of, is <HI>religious Company and Conference.</HI> He that walketh with the Wise shall be wise: But a Companion of Fools shall be destroy'd. (<HI>Prov.</HI> 13.20.) The Fruit of the Righteous is a Tree of Life; and He that winneth Souls is wise (<HI>Prov.</HI> 11.30) I have before directed you to desert (as ruinous) the unnecessary Company of <HI>Vain</HI> Persons. I now farther ad∣vise you to betake your self to the Society of the <HI>Awaken'd</HI> and <HI>Converted;</HI> whose pious
<PB N="32" REF="002256_0142_0FDADE548B83E040"/>Example and Discourse, serious Counsels and Reproofs, may be blessed of GOD for your Conviction. The <HI>Apostle</HI> speaks of Some, <HI>who do not obey the Word,</HI> as if they might be <HI>won by the good Conversation</HI> of their Associates. Some have been wrought upon, <HI>this way,</HI> whom the Word did never reach. Resolve then to be a <HI>Companion of them that fear the LORD.</HI> Acquaint your Self betimes with the Godly; and perhaps their holy Communion may be a Savour of Life unto you. As live-Coals kindle those that are dead: So to con∣verse with lively Saints may have a warm and enlivening Influence upon you. <Q>Light may break in upon you, as a Flame from a spark∣ling Fire!</Q></P>
<P>THESE are the external Helps, which you are advised to use.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>HEARKEN to the lowest</HI> WHISPERS <HI>of</HI> CONSCIENCE; <HI>observe and cultivate the least Beginnings of Conviction.</HI> Hoist and spread the Sails when the Wind <HI>begins</HI> to blow. O∣pen all the Powers of your Soul, to the Di∣vine Breathings; and cherish the faintest Im∣pulses of the HOLY SPIRIT. In the use of Means, wait and watch for Convictions; em∣brace 'em at their <HI>first</HI> Offer or Approach. When Light flashes in upon you, don't let your Heart rise in Opposition, or your Mind divert and start away. But whatsoever good Thought is at any Time darted into you, im∣mediately close with it and fasten it, as a Nail in a sure Place. Whatsoever devout
<PB N="33" REF="002256_0142_0FDADE548B83E040"/>Affection begins to stir in you, don't go to stifle and smother it, but carefully nourish it. Back the first Motions of the SPIRIT with lose Consideration and agreeable Ejaculati∣ons: By which Method a little Spark may happily kindle into a living Flame, and a small Ray of Light prove the Dawning of the perfect Day.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>SEEK to GOD by</HI> PRAYER, <HI>for Convictions.</HI> Prayer indeed shou'd precede, accompany and follow the Use of Means, and Endeavours: And it is an excellent Means it self. Pray to GOD then as for Pardon and other Mercies, so for Conviction and Repentance which is the Gift of GOD. Beg of GOD that He wou'd send His HOLY SPIRIT to convince you of <HI>Sin,</HI> of <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and of <HI>Judgment.</HI> Realize it that GOD only is able (and that He is graciously willing) effectually to en∣lighten and awaken you; and in the belief of this, cease not day and night Crying to GOD, that He would open your Eyes and turn you from Darkness to Light. Beg that He wou'd not suffer you any longer to trample on Con∣science, to resist the SPIRIT and be easy in your Bondage. Beg that He wou'd not leave you to your own foolish Heart and trifling Endeavours in see<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing after Convictions: Beg that GOD woul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ake you out of your false Peace and Security, and inspire you with a just concern for your perishing Soul; that He would give you seeing Eyes, hearing Ears, and a contrite Heart.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="002256_0143_0FDADE5616652F50"/>
BUT if you expect to obtain the desir'd Blessing, you must be <HI>diligent,</HI> and <HI>constant,</HI> in seeking it.— Use your self to transient, ejacu∣latory Prayer on all proper Occasions, which will wonderfully tend to fix your Thoughts and warm your Heart, and perhaps may be the means of lasting Impressions.— Keep up a <HI>stated</HI> course of more solemn Prayer: &amp; in the Name of CHRIST importunately beg for the teaching &amp; convincing Influences of the Divine SPIRIT. Look to your own Spirit, and watch over your Senses, when calling upon the LORD. Don't hurry over your Prayers, and hasten to rise from your Knees. Make a solemn Business of this Duty. Retire into some secret Place, &amp; devote some <HI>Time</HI> to the performance of it. Content not your self with a few bro∣ken Petitions, put up when in Company with others, or in your Bed: Nay, but thou, <HI>when thou prayest, enter into thy Closet, and shut the Door, and pray to thy Father who seeth in secret.</HI> Make Conscience of doing this, <HI>Morning</HI> and <HI>Evening</HI> at least: And endeavour to be fervent in Spirit, &amp; continue instant in Prayer without ceasing. Cold Formality, &amp; Remissness in Prayer drive away the Holy SPIRIT. And I believe there is not a more common &amp; fatal Impediment to Conversion, than the Neglect of, or Negligence in Closet-Duties. Beware then hereof.</P>
<P>THUS I have given you some imperfect Ad∣vice, <HI>What Methods to take in Order to Con∣viction.</HI>
<PB N="35" REF="002256_0143_0FDADE5616652F50"/>And now O Secure Sinner, <HI>We Charge you before GOD and the LORD JESUS CHRIST and the Elect Angels, that you observe these Things.</HI> But know it, if you will not hear: all these Words which I testify unto you this Day, are on Record, &amp; will rise up in Judg∣ment against you; <HI>which GOD forbid!</HI></P>
<P>IT is Time now to hasten to the <HI>SECOND Branch</HI> of the Exhortation.</P>
<P>HAVING spoken to the <HI>Secure:</HI> I am now to Address those among our Young People who are under some CONVICTIONS and AWAKENINGS.</P>
<P>SOME of this Sort, I persuade my self there are here present before the LORD. Sure I am, there has been enough said for the Con∣viction of every considering Sinner. And I hope there are not a Few, who are <HI>enquiring the Way to Zion,</HI> with their Faces thitherward.</P>
<P>UNTO such I shall therefore now offer Something by way of Counsel and Direction. The LORD, who knows who they are, make it a word in Season to them that are weary!</P>
<P>NOW in the First place, Let me exhort you to be THANKFUL <HI>to GOD for your present Troubles and Convictions.</HI></P>
<P>SEE the <HI>Hand of GOD</HI> in Them. Look on your present Trouble of Conscience as the Work of the SPIRIT, whether common or special. They are GOD's Terrors, His Ar∣rows. They must not be imputed to Satan, to your Selves, or to Distemper of Body, as
<PB N="36" REF="002256_0144_0FDADE578E10AD70"/>the original Cause. No; For it is the Hand of GOD, which thus writes bitter Things a∣gainst you, and makes you to possess the Ini∣quities of your Youth. Own and Adore GOD herein. Also see the <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD unto you, Prize your Convictions, and be thank∣ful. Don't resent your Trouble as a Misery and Unhappiness; It is ten thousand Times more eligible than carnal Security, which is the broad Road to Hell.</P>
<P>CONSIDER; This Trouble of Conscience, is the <HI>Method of the Divine</HI> SPIRIT with all that are brought home to GOD; tho' there are very different Degrees of it. He humbles before He exalts. Moreover, This seems re∣quisite in the Reason of Things, as a <HI>necessary Preparatory</HI> to saving <HI>Faith.</HI> For CHRIST will not be precious to any, till Sin &amp; Wrath become bitter and burdensome to Conscience. —And then hereby you are brought <HI>nigh the Kingdom of God,</HI> and may take encourage∣ment from the Invitations of the Gospel; which are peculiarly directed to such as la∣bour &amp; are heavy laden. — Your present Trouble is a <HI>Symptom of intended Mercy.</HI> It is wholesome Discipline you are under. <Q>It is the SPIRIT of GOD that is wounding of you, &amp; you need not fear a Lance in the Hand of Love &amp; Tenderness.</Q> O don't re∣gret your Case then; but be thankful to GOD, that you are not left to such a Spirit of Slumber, as many others about you are, and as you also deservedly might have been.
<PB N="37" REF="002256_0144_0FDADE578E10AD70"/>Don't envy the secure their quiet &amp; ease, which is false &amp; groundless, and makes them the Objects of Scorn &amp; Pity, rather than of Envy.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>BE careful to</HI> PRESERVE <HI>your present Convictions; and watch against all that threatens you with the loss of them, or miscarriage under them.</HI> You are in great Danger: For the <HI>Devil</HI> hates to see you under this Trouble; He is afraid of losing a Subject, &amp; gnasheth his Teeth for Vexation. And be sure he will use all his Art &amp; Strength to recover &amp; secure you in his own Possession. He will make use of the <HI>World</HI> without and a deceitful wicked <HI>Heart</HI> within to accomplish his malicious De∣signs upon you. The Flesh, World, &amp; Devil are in a cursed Concert to rob you of your present Convictions, or defeat the end of them. This speaks your Danger, &amp; loudly calls up∣on you to Watch &amp; Pray that you enter no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> into such Temptations, as may endanger you.</P>
<P><HI>SEE then that you don't Espouse any flattering &amp; stupifying Principles.</HI> a vast Variety whereof there is, agreeable to the Tendencies of corrupt Nature &amp; the Dictates of the carnal Mind; which Sinners in their Distress often eagerly imbibe, whereby they are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ull'd into Securi∣ty, &amp; drown'd in Perdition. Watch against all such Opinions. Be careful therefore what <HI>Books</HI> you read: Beware also what <HI>Teachers</HI> you repair to in your Troubles. <Q>There are many <HI>spiritual</HI> Mountebanks as well as <HI>natu∣ral,</HI> that poison sick Souls, as others do sick
<PB N="38" REF="002256_0145_0FDADE5EAAE6E130"/>Bodies.</Q> From such withdraw thy self.— But, Don't <HI>decline a Faithful Searching Ministry,</HI> because you can't sit under it with a quiet easy Consci∣ence; as the Apostle has foretold some would do, (2 <HI>Tim</HI> 4.3, 4.) Neither date to <HI>hide</HI> or <HI>deride</HI> the Convictions of the Spirit, as the manner of some is; nor treat them as <HI>unwelcome</HI> Guests, by flying fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m them, or resisting of them. — Again, <HI>Be∣ware of a delaying Frame.</HI> Don't elude Cons∣cience by <HI>idle Excuses.</HI> Take heed you don't betray your Soul into Rum by pretended Re∣solutions of <HI>future Repentance.</HI> Take heed you don't <HI>abuse</HI> the Doctrines of the spiritual <HI>Impotence</HI> of Humane Nature, and of the <HI>Difficulty</HI> of Repentance &amp; Obedience; and make them a pretence for sloth &amp; present delay. — Take heed you don't <HI>presume on the Patience</HI> of GOD, &amp; because you are <HI>Young put far from you the Evil Day,</HI> &amp; apprehend∣ing no present Danger be tempted to leave your Conversion as a matter of <HI>future</HI> con∣cern, and suffer good Disposions to wear off and die away from Time to Time.— Again, Have a Care of <HI>proud Self sufficiency,</HI> and of <HI>undue Confidence in the Means of Grace,</HI> without a proper Respect to the supreme Ef∣ficient; whereby you will dishonour and af∣front the HOLY SPIRIT and provoke Him to suspend His Divine Influences; whereupon the most promising Means and best Endea∣vours will be insignificant; and you will ne∣cessarily return to former Security. Again, <HI>Beware of making rash Resolutions in your own
<PB N="39" REF="002256_0145_0FDADE5EAAE6E130"/>Strength;</HI> whereby you will forfe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t the Aids of Divine Grace, and provoke GOD to leave you to the power of Satan, as a just punishment of your Pride and Presumtion. Again, Take heed of <HI>indulging any secret Lust,</HI> or <HI>persisting in any known Way of Wickedness;</HI> which will offend the HOLY SPIRIT, and must needs de∣file and cloud and harden Conscience. Again, Beware of a <HI>Self-righteous Spirit.</HI> "Take heed of valuing your own Tears in the room of CHRIST's Blood", of advancing your own Performances into the place of His meritori∣ous obedience, and setting your own Prayers in the room of His Intercession. If you in∣dulge such a legal Pharisaical Spirit, you may perhaps pacify Conscience hereby, but you will only inflame the Wrath of GOD yet more against you, and provoke the Spirit to leave you. Again, Beware of <HI>Discouragement.</HI> As you must not give Way to false Hopes, so neither to Despondencies. Don't take up any desperate Conclusions, as if there was no Hope nor Help for you; this will check &amp; chill Convictions, weaken and obstruct the Motions of the Spirit; and tempt you to abandon your self to sullen Melancholy or sottish Se∣curity. Finally, Beware of <HI>all worldly Entice∣ments and Entanglements.</HI> Endeavour to get above the Frowns &amp; Flatteries of the World. Take heed lest you fall asleep on the soft Pil∣low of external Ease, Pomp &amp; Pleasure. Be blind to the deceitful Smiles, and deaf to the tempting Charms of a vain World. And take
<PB N="40" REF="002256_0146_0FDADE61752A2350"/>heed lest the Cares of this Life choak the Word, &amp; you lose your Convictions in a Throng of worldly Fears, Projects, and Em∣ployments. Multitudes do drown in the Sea, or bury in the Earth, or barter away in the Shop, or let one care or other suppress &amp; shift off the Convictions they receive in the House of GOD. Unhappy Business has slain its Ten Thousands. Take heed lest being careful &amp; cumber'd about many Things, you forget and forfeit the one Thing needful.</P>
<P>FURTHER Beware of <HI>Evil Company.</HI> This was caution'd against before as tending to <HI>keep</HI> Sinners secure; and now as tending to <HI>make</HI> Sinners secure. And indeed those under Con∣victions have as much need of being warned against this Temptation, as those in Security. For how often do vain Companions perswade the convinced Sinner off of serious Resoluti∣ons, &amp; laugh him out of a pensive Frame, or hector away his Troubles? O save your self therefore from this untoward Generation. Have no Fellowship with the unfruitful Works of Darkness. Resolve with the <HI>Psal∣mist,</HI> &amp; say; Depart from me, all ye Workers of Iniquity, for I will keep the Command∣ments of my GOD.—And also Beware of be∣ing infected by <HI>Evil Examples.</HI> Others Secu∣rity is, no Doubt, a common Temptation to Young People. They see their Companions, and alas! too often their <HI>Elders,</HI> Their Pa∣rents (it may be) or Masters and Mistresses, These they observe are light and vain; and
<PB N="41" REF="002256_0146_0FDADE61752A2350"/>this prompts them to shake off awakening Thoughts &amp; Fears. Beware O YOUNG MAN, of this too common Snare. Let neither <HI>Fear</HI> nor <HI>Love</HI> of any betray you into an <HI>Imitation</HI> of their Security. Dare to be singular in that which is good. Don't give Way to a vicious Shame or false Modesty, which may tempt you to sinful Compliances with others.</P>
<P>FURTHER, Beware of <HI>carnal Counsels</HI> in the day of your Distress. Unbelieving Friends are some of the <HI>worst</HI> Counsellours in this case. The best Advice that such miserable Comforters or∣dinarily give is to <HI>heave off</HI> trouble some Impressi∣ons, to enjoy ones self, &amp; Friends, and the Com∣forts of Life, &amp;c. And what Numbers of Young People have fatally miscarry'd under hopeful Convictions by hearkening to such unhappy Advice? O stop your Ears against the baneful Counsels of carnal Acquaintants. <HI>Consult not with Flesh and Blood, My Son, if Sinners entice thee, consent thou not. Let the Counsel of the Wicked be far from you.</HI> Listen not to the ungodly Whispers or Clamours of Men of corrupt Minds, however you may be related to or dependent on them. In a word, <HI>Harden</HI> your self against the <HI>Flouts</HI> and <HI>Scoffs</HI> of them that are at Ease in Zion. Put on Courage and Resolution; for want where∣of Conscience is not seldom over-awed &amp; born down against it's own Light and Bent.</P>
<P>THUS I have caution'd you against some of the many Wiles whereby Satan uses to <HI>di∣vert</HI> or <HI>pervert</HI> Convictions begun in Young
<PB N="42" REF="002256_0147_0FDADE62EF278880"/>People. <HI>O study the various Policies of the E∣nemy.</HI> Be not ignorant of his Devices, lest he get an Advantage against you.

Consider; your Great Judge keeps an exact Memorandum of all the Motions of His SPIRIT, &amp; your En∣tertainment of them; &amp; will one day call you to an Account for them; &amp; how will you answer it, if you quench your Convicti∣ons? If you do thus, verily your Guilt &amp; your Folly will be great. This will be to add Rebellion to Sin. Hereby you will fight against GOD, disobey His Voice, abuse His Patience &amp; affront His HOLY SPIRIT. You will impiously &amp; basely fly in the Face of your Great Physician and despise the only Re∣medy. You will hereby provoke the grieved Spirit to forsake you; which is a Judgment (I fear) not a few of the risen Youth of this dege∣nerate Day are under: And you will highly gra∣tify the unclean Spirit, &amp; invite his Return into his old Dwelling with more strength and com∣pany than Ever; and so your last State will be worse than the first, more miserable and more dangerous. You will then be in danger of growing worse and worse, &amp; treasuring

<PB N="44" REF="002256_0148_0FDADE6466CC9E00"/>And endeavour to fasten, and perfect them every Day, that they may rise into a clearer Light and stronger Flame, till the Sun of Righteousness shine upon you with Healing under his Wings, and the Day dawn in your Heart. Endeavour to <HI>get forward</HI> into the Work of Humiliation &amp; Contrition; else your Convictions will be of no real benefit to you. Rest not till you are got into a state of Evangelical Repentance. — Which brings me to the last Thing under this Head,—</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>LABOUR after a true and thorough</HI> CON∣VERSION <HI>to GOD.</HI> Rest not in your present State: but seek after the washing of Rege∣neration, &amp; the Renewing of the Holy Ghost. Don't stop at Convictions and imperfect Be∣ginnings of Repentance: but labour after an unfeigned Close with CHRIST, &amp; complete Con∣version to GOD. <HI>Peter's</HI> Advice to them, who were <HI>pricked in their Heart</HI> was that; <HI>REPENT,</HI> and be Baptized in the Name of CHRIST.— <HI>Paul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Advice to the trembling <HI>Jayler</HI> was that; <HI>BELEIVE</HI> on the Lord JESUS CHRIST. Be exhorted then to return to GOD in the way of Repentance; &amp; hasten to CHRIST in the way of Faith.—Otherwise you can never find <HI>Rest</HI> to your troubled Soul.—Otherwise all the weary steps you have already taken toward your Salvation will be <HI>lost</HI> Labour. Thou are not far from the Kingdom of GOD: and will you suffer your self to perish on the very Bor∣ders of Canaan? To go to Hell by the Gates of Heaven, as the <HI>foolish Virgins</HI> did, This is
<PB N="45" REF="002256_0148_0FDADE6466CC9E00"/>dreadful indeed, &amp; how bitter will be the Reflection? — Now this you are in danger of thro' the Temptations of <HI>Satan,</HI> and the Treachery of an evil <HI>Heart</HI> that is ready to side with him.</P>
<P>BE Exhorted then to <HI>work out your Salva∣tion with Fear &amp; Trembling. STRIVE</HI> to enter in at the strait Gate; for many shall seek to enter in and shall not.</P>
<P>AND <HI>what Thou doest, do quickly.</HI> It is a matter of Life &amp; Death, &amp; requires Haste. No Advantage is to be gotten by Delays. A great deal of Good is lost hereby. Your Troubles are needlesly prolonged; and many Evils incurr'd. And besides, thereby you do forfeit the Grace of GOD, without which you can can't improve your Convictions (admit they be continu'd, which is uncertain) to effectual Repentance. Behold, <HI>NOW</HI> is the accepted Time. Yet a little while is the Light with you; walk while ye have the Light, lest Darkness come upon you. Now believe in the Light, that ye may be the Children of Light.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>let no Man deceive Himself.</HI> Beware of mistaking the <HI>Nature</HI> or the <HI>Signs</HI> of Conver∣sion. Remember; Conversion does not lie in, nor is evidenced by a visible Profession and Form of Godliness; a reformed Life &amp; moral Virtue: or inward legal Terrors &amp; transient Qualms of religious Melancholy: or some volatile Sparklings of devout Affection<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some sudden Starts of Desire or Plashes of Joy: or
<PB N="46" REF="002256_0149_0FDADE8D84E7CC60"/>a dead Faith, &amp; presumtuous Reliance on the Merits of CHRIST: nor is a seeming Peace &amp; Serenity of Mind, after great Ter∣rors of Conscience &amp; an apprehended Work of Conviction, any Argument of saving Con∣version. — Too many there are, who deceive themselves with these Things; judging their State good, either upon wrong Principles, or false Evidences. <HI>There is a Generation that are pure in their own eyes; and yet are not washed from their filthiness,</HI> Prov. 30.12. But the Day is coming when the <HI>Searcher of Hearts</HI> (who can't be deceiv'd &amp; who won't be mock'd) will judge the World in Righteousness: &amp; Self-De∣ceit in this matter will prove of undoing Consequence.—Be jealous then over your own Heart, that you don't deceive your self with a partial or superficial Work of the Spirit, instead of a true &amp; thorough Operation. Be careful that you don't <HI>mistake</HI> the true Cha∣racters of the Regenerate; that you don't <HI>content</HI> your self with any Thing <HI>short</HI> of them; neither <HI>rashly</HI> apply 'em.</P>
<P><HI>USE all proper Means</HI> conducive to Conver∣sion. Attend on the Ordinances of GOD, es∣pecially the Word Preached, which is the ordinary Vehicle of sanctifying Influences.— Study the Gospel: Meditate much on the Promises of GOD, whereby awaken'd Sinners are made Partakers of the Divine Nature; and on the Blood of CHRIST, which only can purge your Conscience from dead Works to serve the living GOD.— Discover your Case,
<PB N="47" REF="002256_0149_0FDADE8D84E7CC60"/>and go for Counsel, to some tender, faithful, judicious, experienc'd Christians; and parti∣cularly the Ministers of the Gospel, whose Business as well as Delight it is to shew you the way of Salvation and assist you under your spiritual Troubles. — But see that you use these and all other Means <HI>Dependently,</HI> with an Eye to CHRIST as the Head of Influences, without whom the best Means will be ineffec∣tual. — And use them <HI>Diligently.</HI> Use all appointed Means public and private. Im∣prove all proper opportunities, and spare no Pains. Let <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Hand</HI> be engag'd, and make a <HI>Work</HI> on't. Content not your self with lazy Wishes, or cold Attempts; which is the next Reason of many Sinners failing of the Grace of GOD. (See Prov. 21.25.)</P>
<P>YET <HI>do not rest in the bare Use of Means, or think to obtain the desired End by your own <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olitary Endeavors.</HI> But <HI>open your Case to GOD in Prayer:</HI> Carry your Complaint to the Throne of Grace; and beg for converting Influences from above. Have all your Expec∣tation from GOD in and through CHRIST. Pray in the Name of CHRIST; Plead His Merits, His Power, and gracious Promises: Plead <HI>earnestly.</HI> And pray <HI>humbly:</HI> GOD re∣sists the proud, but giveth Grace to the hum∣ble. Acknowlege your own utter Unworthi∣ness. Adore the Sovereignty of Divine Grace, and submit to the Methods of Divine Wis∣dom. Be content, that GOD shou'd take His own way in bringing you Home to Himself,
<PB N="48" REF="002256_0150_0FDC176CB0FC5820"/>tho' it be through great Terrors and Sorrows: and be willing to wait His Time. Resolve humbly to take no Denial; and Give Him no rest. Tho' there be long Delays, yet wait patiently for the LORD; supporting your Hopes by that word of Promise, in Joh. 6.37. <HI>Him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> All that ever obtained Mercy, sought for it on this Encouragement;—<HI>It may be the LORD will be gracious.</HI> Go thou also, and seek the LORD while He may be found. <HI>Ask,</HI> and <HI>Seek,</HI> and <HI>Knock,</HI> with unceasing Hope and unfainting Importunity. Thus <HI>draw near to GOD,</HI> and <HI>He will draw near to you,</HI> (Jam. 4.8.) <HI>And will send forth Judgment unto Victory,</HI> Mat. 12.20.</P>
<P>Finally, HAVING thus sought to GOD for Help, Now take another Step; <HI>Make the TRIAL whether Quickening and Regenerating Influ∣ences are not commanded from above for you</HI> Remember How, when CHRIST directed the Man with a <HI>withered Arm</HI> to stretch forth his Hand, he immediately <HI>attempted</HI> and was ena∣bled to do it. Now Imitate this great Action. In the Belief and Hope of Divine Assistance <HI>TRY</HI> to lift up thy Soul, and stir up thy self to lay hold on GOD and do the Acts of a Soul re∣turning to the LORD. Up and be doing. Set thy self in the Strength of CHRIST to go through the whole Process of active Conver∣sion. Give not Sleep to thine Eyes, 'till thou' hast endeavour'd this: And leave not Try∣ing, till you find the Symptoms of a thorough
<PB N="49" REF="002256_0150_0FDC176CB0FC5820"/>Work of Repentance toward GOD and of Faith towards our LORD JESUS CHRIST wrought in you:—What this implies, you have been told already in several of the pre∣ceeding Sermons; to which I must refer you.</P>
<P>AND so I have finish'd my Address to the <HI>awaken'd</HI> Youth. And now the good LORD keep this in the Imagination of the Thoughts of your Heart, and prepare your Heart unto Him! I hope I leave some of you inspir'd with never-dying Resolutions to be waiting on the LORD in the Methods now directed to.</P>
<P>THE Third and last Branch of the <HI>Exhor∣tation</HI> is to the <HI>REGENERATE, the Converts of Sion.</HI></P>
<P>SOME such (We trust) there be among our Young People, as bad as the Times are: Yea <HI>Many</HI> (through the Grace of GOD) do we behold walking in the Truth. I hope I speak to not a Few Such at this Time. Now, Ye that fear GOD, give Audience. Hear the the Exhortation, which speaketh to <HI>You</HI> as unto <HI>Children.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. BE counsel'd to <HI>endeavour after a well-grounded</HI> HOPE <HI>and</HI> ASSURANCE <HI>of your good Estate.</HI></P>
<P>I begin with this Advice, because to Me it seems to lie in the Foundation of such other Counsels, as are to be given the Regene∣rate. <HI>Wherefore Brethren, the rather give dili∣gence to make your Calling and Election sure,</HI> 2 Per. 1.10. Rest not in Uncertainties: But
<PB N="50" REF="002256_0151_0FDAC980571E7500"/>labor after <HI>the Assurance of Faith.</HI> To this End; Study your own Hearts, and be much in Self-examination. Try your Selves by just Rules; and be deliberate, prudent, impartial, prayerful, and frequent in this Work. And cease not till you come to a rational Satisfac∣tion about your Regeneracy: Which will be a mighty incentive to Duty; will enable you to take the Comfort that belongs to you; and will be a great Support and Defense in Hours of Temptation. For want of that, Many lose the Comfort, and neglect some of the Duties of Early Piety; which is sad.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>STUDY</HI> THANKFULNESS <HI>to GOD, the</HI> GREATEST <HI>Thankfulness.</HI> Give GOD the Glo∣ry of your Conversion. Beware of ascribing too Much to Means, Instruments, and Endea∣vors. Let him that Glorieth, glory in the LORD. See His Efficiency; and Adore His Wisdom, Power, and Grace, which have a∣bounded toward You. And let your Heart and Mouth be filled with admiring Praises.</P>
<P>TO excite your Gratitude and Wonder, Often look back on your <HI>natural</HI> Condition, and take a View of the Guilts, Miseries, and Dangers of it. Consider also the superlative Excellency of the <HI>Work</HI> wrought upon You; and the Blessedness of the <HI>State</HI> you are brought into; a State of Justification, Adop∣tion, and Sanctification, and of habitual Pre∣paredness for a glorious Eternity. Consider the special and unnumber'd <HI>Advantages</HI> of an Early Conversion; and what a far more ex∣ceeding
<PB N="51" REF="002256_0151_0FDAC980571E7500"/>glorious Prospect it affords you. And consider, How God hath made you to <HI>differ</HI> from innumerable Others. Remember also what <HI>Provocations</HI> you gave the HOLY SPIRIT (while under His Hand) to forsake you. These Reflections bespeak your thankful Ad∣mirations. Wherefore take with you Words, and say as in <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.25, 6. <HI>I thank Thee,</HI> O Father, because Thou hast hid these Things from the Wise and Prudent, and hast reveal∣ed them unto Babes: Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy Sight.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>KEEP up a very</HI> HUMBLE <HI>Frame of Spi∣rit.</HI> Remembring what you were <HI>before</HI> Con∣version: Remembring what <HI>Humiliations</HI> you passed through <HI>in</HI> Conversion: And Consider∣ing what you are at <HI>present;</HI> still at a Dis∣tance from GOD; still a Dependent on free Mercy for all you need; still a sinful Crea∣ture, doing little for GOD, often rebelling against Him, and in all Things coming short of His Glory; still feeble and impotent and without His special Help will become an ea∣sy Prey to every Temptation; still in danger of such Apostasies, as may blemish your Name, gall your Conscience, and procure the Hidings of GOD's Face. — O remember these Things, and let them check all the Tendencies of a corrupt Heart to spiritual Pride. Be not high-minded; but Fear. — I think fit to add here; <HI>don't proudly murmur if you do not pre∣sently obtain those Joys, you looked for,</HI> If you meet with Temptations, and Troubles within
<PB N="52" REF="002256_0152_0FDADE65C3A5C2F8"/>and without, yet don't <HI>repine.</HI> You are not now dealt with unjustly: Nay all is in Love to you. GOD is now training you up to live a Life of Faith. Perhaps He is (by His pre∣sent Methods) ripening you for great Conso∣lation; or preparing you for great Usefulness hereafter. Beware then of every murmuring, and of every Self-exalting Thought.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>BRING forth Fruits</HI> MEET <HI>for</HI> REPEN∣TANCE, and walk in Newness of Life. As ye have received CHRIST JESUS the LORD: So Walk ye in Him. Put on the Livery of CHRIST; take upon you the Badges of Christianity; make an open Profession; or∣der your Conversation aright, and shew forth the Praises of Him who hath called you out of Darkness. For ye were sometimes Dark∣ness, but now are ye Light in the LORD: Walk as the Children of Light. Flee Youth∣ful Lusts: And live soberly, righteously, and godlily.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>SEE that ye walk</HI> CIRCUMSPECTLY. Walk by Rule, the Gospel-Rule. Study it; govern your selves according to it in the whole Work of Obedience, as to Matter and Manner, Principles, Motives, and Seasons. The Scriptures were written to <HI>give the Young Man. Knowlege and Discretion.</HI> And <HI>Young Men</HI> are directed to <HI>cleanse their way,</HI> by <HI>tak∣ing Heed thereto according to God's Word,</HI> Psal. 119.9.</P>
<P>THEREFORE keep the Rule over before you: and exercise your selves always to keep
<PB N="53" REF="002256_0152_0FDADE65C3A5C2F8"/>Consciences void of Offence. It was <HI>David</HI>'s Resolution in his Early Days, (Psal. 101.2.) <HI>I will behave my self</HI> wisely <HI>in a perfect way;</HI> And it should be <HI>your</HI>'s. — Youth is apt to be Heady, Venturous, and Inadvertent, which of∣ten betrays into sad Mistakes and Miscarria∣ges. But be not you so. Be wary and vigi∣lant. Reverence Conscience, consult much with it, &amp; be obsequious to all it's genuine Directions. Look well to your goings. Look about you, and take <HI>Example</HI> from the Wise, and <HI>Caution</HI> from the Foolish, and take Heed lest you fall. Be ever sensible of Dangers; keep up a jealous Watch over your Hearts, and a strict Guard over your Senses, Appetites, and Passions. Keep your selves from your own Iniquity. Suppress the first Motions of Lust. Fly the very Occasions of Sin; the goodly <HI>Hebrew Youth</HI> thus secur'd his Integri∣ty. Remember Young <HI>Dinah</HI>'s Folly and Fall; and don't needlesly run into the way of Tem∣tations. Be careful with <HI>whom</HI> you contract year <HI>Relations;</HI> take heed how you dispose your selves in Apprenticeship, in Marriage, &amp;c. — Be careful in the Choice of a <HI>Calling,</HI> let it be One that has fewest spiritual Snares, and will afford you most Advantages for your Souls; and therein study to order your Af∣fairs with Discretion, so as not to hurt your grand Interests.—Be careful in chusing your <HI>Place of Abode;</HI> Endeavor to settle where you may have the best Opportunities and Accom∣modations for promoting the Glory of GOD,
<PB N="54" REF="002256_0153_0FDADE6B8879F7B8"/>and your own Spiritual Good.—Be watchuful over your selves in all <HI>Conditions;</HI> Some of you are born to Riches and Honour, Others to Want and Meanness. Let the <HI>Poor</HI> &amp; <HI>Afflicted</HI> among you watch against Discontent at the Disposals of Divine Wisdom &amp; Goodness; and against envying at the Prosperity of others; Begin now you are Young to learn the Art of Contentment; and this will have a happy Influence upon you all your Days. And those that are <HI>Prosperous,</HI> and live in Ease, and make a Figure in the World; Let such be thankful, and humble, and self denying, Heavenly minded, and Fruitful in every good Work: and thus you will be prepard for whatever Changes there may be in the right Hand of the Most High.—Again, Be circumspect in all matters of <HI>lawful Liberty;</HI> in which case Young Peo∣ple especially are very apt to offend, &amp; as hard to be convine'd &amp; reclaimed. Take heed then to your selves in all Things (of an indifferent Nature,) that you act agreeably to the Laws of Charity, by the Rules of Decency &amp; of Expediency, and under the Restraints of Christian Sobriety, and with a just Deference to the wise Counsels &amp; Cau∣tions of Parents &amp; Superiors.—See to it that your <HI>Diversions</HI> be well principle'd and well regulated. Let them be such as are of good Report among Us; let them be seaso∣nably enter'd on &amp; timely broken off; mo∣derately pursu'd; and well intended, to fit you the better for serving GOD, and your
<PB N="55" REF="002256_0153_0FDADE6B8879F7B8"/>Generation, which should be your primary Delight &amp; Satisfaction.</P>
<P>FURTHER, Be very Circumspect as to your <HI>Company</HI> &amp; <HI>Conversation.</HI> Be careful in <HI>chusing</HI> your Associates. Don't degrade your selves with <HI>Nebuchalnezzet</HI> to herd with the Beasts. Let a vile Person be contemned in your Eyes: but honour them that fear the Lord, and with <HI>David</HI> be a Companion of such, as keep the Commandments of GOD, who are most likely to be Friends to your Souls, whose Fruit is a Tree of Life. <Q>You may visit wicked Persons, as their <HI>Physicians:</HI> but not as their <HI>Companions,</HI> lest you catch <HI>Infection</HI> from them.</Q> Take such for your Associares, as may be Assistents to you in the Affairs of your Souls; and for a <HI>Special Friend</HI> I would advise Young People to chuse One, that is of more <HI>Experience</HI> than them∣selves, and so capable to direct them; and one that is something more <HI>advanced in Age</HI> and <HI>Rank,</HI> whose Presence may carry some Awe with it, &amp; whose Admonitions may be of more weight.—And as you should be circumspect in <HI>chusing</HI> your Acquaintants; so likewise in <HI>using</HI> of their Society. Be wise and wary in your Visits, that these be not a fruitless Mispense of Time. And in your occasional Conversation at all Times en∣deavour wisely to introduce &amp; keep up pro∣fitable Discourse; and in your talk of Secular Affairs, let your Language be such as may discover a godly simplicity, and show that
<PB N="56" REF="002256_0154_0FDADE6C8798DAD0"/>the spirit of this World has not the Ascen∣dent over you. This is to walk in Wisdom. But if in Conversation your study is to please Men by appearing Worldly-wise, or facetions, and entertaining, rather than to approve your selves to GOD by being grave, pious and edi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying, certainly now you walk not Circumspectly, but as Fools. — Let Young Professors then be exhorted to make their Acquaintance &amp; Converse together as spiritu∣al &amp; profitable as may be.</P>
<P>AND here I might add; Let such Young People as live in the same House or Neigh∣bourhood, by mutual Agreement oblige them∣selves to special watch &amp; care over each other. Speak often one to another. Com∣fort your selves together, &amp; edify one ano∣ther, <HI>even as also ye do.</HI> And watch over each other in Brotherly Love. Be faithful Monitors every one to his Brother; and let every one be ready to hearken to friendly Counsels &amp; Reproofs. When the Righteous smite thee, let it be a kindness; and let the wounds of a Friend be as excellent Oyl.</P>
<P>THUS I have shown Young People in seve∣ral Instances how they are to walk Circum∣spectly. And O that you would all be per∣swaded to endeavour it. In order to this, Consider how you are oblig'd by your <HI>Pro∣fession</HI> &amp; <HI>Engagements</HI> thus to walk. Consider also what <HI>Dangers</HI> &amp; <HI>Difficulties</HI> attend the Christian Life, arising from inward Corrup∣tion and outward Oppositions; which call
<PB N="57" REF="002256_0154_0FDADE6C8798DAD0"/>for the exactest Care and greatest Watchful∣ness. You are setting out in a World full of Snares, and in an uncommon Day of Temp∣tation; and without the greatest Circum∣spection you will be in imminent Hazard of such Falls into Sin, as will wound Conscience, disturb it's Peace and defile its Purity. More∣over, Consider; You are under the most <HI>cri∣tical Inspection.</HI> The jealous Eye of an <HI>All-seeing GOD</HI> is upon you continually; who will be highly provoked if you are secure and negligent; which should awe you, me∣thinks, into the strictest watch over your Hearts &amp; Ways, that you may walk before Him unto all well-pleasing. Again, The Eyes of <HI>Men</HI> are upon you. <HI>Good</HI> People have their Eye upon you; Their Desire is toward you, their Delight in you, &amp; their Expectations from you great. This shou'd by a Principle of Ambition lead you to be care∣ful in your Walk. But further, <HI>Wicked</HI> Peo∣ple look on you with an evil Eye: These watch for your Halting; They'l be glad to see you careless, and they wish for your fal∣ling. This would rejoyce (as well as harden) them exceedingly. Again, The <HI>Devils</HI> keep an envious Eye over you; they observe you nar∣rowly; they are continually longing and labouring to ensnare you; if you are secure and heedless, you expose your selves to their subtil Devices; and if you fall by them, they'l triumph over you, insult &amp; vex you.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="002256_0155_0FDADE6E29D06438"/>
BUT in the last place, Consider the many <HI>Encouragements</HI> you have to be walking Cir∣cumspectly. You have an unerring Rule to lead you: You have, to animate you, the Ex∣ample of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and of many Saints who were holy and wise in Be∣haviour from their Youth: And you have all needful Assistance tender'd you: And the Pro∣mise of great Rewards, which will by vast Excesses more than Counter-balance and com∣pensate for all the Cares and Pains of a cir∣cumspect walk. In a word, This Christian Vigilance and Prudence is the Strength and Beauty of the Soul. Therefore keep your Heart with all Diligence, that none take a∣way your Crown. Watch and Pray, lest ye enter into Temptation. He that trusteth in his own Heart is a Fool, but whoso walk∣eth wisely shall be delivered.</P>
<P N="6"><HI>6. LET Young People study to ADORN the</HI> DOC∣TRINE <HI>of GOD your Saviour in all Things, and to walk worthy of the holy Vocation wherewith you are called.</HI> Ye are the Children of the Day; and we exhort every one of you, that you wou'd walk worthy of GOD who hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lled you unto His Kingdom and Glory, and order your Conversation as becometh the Gos∣pel of CHRIST. Let your Light shine before Men: And study to be real and visible Orna∣ments to your Profession. For this End; Guard against all Affectation, that your Good be not evil spoken of. Pu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> away all Childish Vanities, and endeavor to be Manly and Dis∣crete
<PB N="59" REF="002256_0155_0FDADE6E29D06438"/>in your whole Deportment. Abstain from all appearance of Youthful Lusts, that the Word of GOD be not blasphemed. En∣deavor to be Exemplary in all those Things, which are acceptable to GOD and approved of Men, lovely, venerable, and praise-worthy. A bound and excell in all Instances of <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Devotion.</HI> Shew a profound Vene∣ration of all that is sacred; Be strict in obser∣ving the Sabbath; Signalize your selves for a very reverent Regard to the holy Scriptures, and to the Ministers of CHRIST, as Stewards of the Mysteries of GOD. Speak with Awe of GOD and holy Things, and exhibit the utmost Gravity in the Wor∣ship of GOD, a visible Alacrity in His Service and a well-order'd Zeal for His Glory. And be of catholick Principles and a generous Spi∣rit as to the disputable Points and lesser Cir∣cumstances of Religion. And further Endea∣vor to excell in all <HI>Social</HI> Virtues and <HI>Relative</HI> Duties. Distinguish your selves for eminent Justice &amp; Uprightness in your Dealings; Grati∣tude to Benefactors; Brotherly Kindness; Charity to the Poor; Peaceableness, and For∣bearance, a forgiving Spirit, and Patience un∣der Injuries and Affronts; Meekness under Reproofs; Mildness in Disputes; Tractable∣ness and Submission to the Advice of Superiors: Dutifulness to Parents; Obedience to Mas∣ters, Fidelity to all Trusts; Modesty in Ap∣parel, in Speech and Demeanour, &amp;c. Again, Study to excell in all more <HI>solitary</HI> Virtues;
<PB N="60" REF="002256_0156_0FDADE6F957921A0"/>Self-denial, Weanedness from the World, and Mortification to sensual Pleasures; Frugality, and Temperance in Sleep, and Diet; Chasti∣ty, Purity, and Reserv'dness; Application to good Business and Industry therein, &amp;c. You shou'd endeavour to exceed and out shine o∣thers in these moral Qualifications &amp; Deport∣ments, as well as in the Instances of more vital and essential Piety.</P>
<P>Finally, BETIMES begin to study <HI>Useful∣ness.</HI> Aim at being public Blessings in your Day. Young Converts are the Seed and Hope of the <HI>next</HI> Generation, as old Disciples are the Defence &amp; Delight of the <HI>Present.</HI> Therefore begin Early to get fit for your Master's Use; get furnish'd for and ready to every good work; cherish a public Spirit in your selves betimes, and do what little Services you are capable of in your respective Spheres now in the Days of your Youth. Shine as Lights in the Fami∣ly, in the School or College, in the Church, and in the Common-wealth: Shine as Bright as you can in your several Orbs, and study to be Diffusive Blessings. Particularly endeavor to promote the Conversion of other Young People of your Acquaintance; &amp; take all proper Methods to cultivate good Beginnings in one another; according to the Advice before given.</P>
<P>IN these and other Ways Young People shou'd study to honour the Gospel, and adorn their Profession. This you shou'd be led to from a Principle of <HI>Retaliation,</HI> considering how the Gospel has been the Means of Ad∣vancing
<PB N="61" REF="002256_0156_0FDADE6F957921A0"/>you to great Happiness and Dignity: And also from a View to the <HI>Glory of GOD,</HI> which will be abundantly promoted by such Carriage: and also from a Regard to your own <HI>Credit and Interest;</HI> Which Consideration shou'd inspire you (Methinks) with <HI>Heroick</HI> Resolutions. But further this is what the <HI>Word of GOD</HI> expresly <HI>enjoyns</HI> as the Duty of Young People; particularly in the 2d. Chap∣ter of the Epistle to <HI>Titus;</HI> which excellent Portion of Scripture you'l do well very fre∣quently to consult.</P>
<P>BUT to add only one Word; and I will Conclude,—</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>LET Young Saints endeavour to</HI> GROW <HI>in Grace.</HI> Furthermore then we beseech you Young Men &amp; Brethren, and exhort you by the LORD JESUS, that as ye have received of Us how you ought to walk &amp; to please GOD, so ye wou'd <HI>abound</HI> more &amp; more. Don't rest in any present Attainments: but study to make <HI>Pro∣gress</HI> in Virtue &amp; all Goodness. "Diligent Trades∣men at their first setting up have their Minds intent upon <HI>improving</HI> their Stock". Herein let not the Children of this World be wiser than you. Let not the Truth of Grace content you: but aspire after a gradual Rise. It was the Apostle's Exhortation to Young <HI>Timothy, Thou therefore my Son, Be STRONG in the Grace that is in Christ Jesus. — FOLLOW after Righ∣teousness, Faith, Love,</HI> &amp;c. — There must be a <HI>Patient continuance in well-doing,</HI> and studious Endeavours <HI>to perfect Holiness in the fear of GOD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="002256_0157_0FDADE712643C2D8"/>
GROWTH in pure &amp; practical Religion is the chief Blessing on this side the Heavenly Places: This is to grow in conformity to CHRIST, who has left us a perfect Example of Early Piety. This is to be changed into the Image of GOD from Glory to Glory. This is the way to grow in the Favour of GOD; and in the Comforts of the HOLY GHOST; in Usefulness to the World; in Ripe∣ness for Heaven, Assurance of Salvation, and a Capacity for more exalted Degrees of fu∣ture Bliss and Glory. Surely then the thriv∣ing Christian is the <HI>wisest,</HI> the <HI>noblest,</HI> the <HI>richest,</HI> &amp; <HI>happiest</HI> Creature out of Paradise. To flourish &amp; increase in Holiness is infinitely preferrible to the highest Advances in the wealth and wisdom of this World, and Ho∣nour among Men.</P>
<P>AND now <HI>That</HI> is what <HI>GOD demands</HI> and expects from you. He looks for <HI>much</HI> Fruit: And O how pleasing to Him will be the fair and rising young Trees, spreading out and hanging full of early ripe Fruits! —And more∣over <HI>That</HI> is what you are under the strictest <HI>Engagements</HI> to study, and have special <HI>Advan∣tages</HI> to pursue. Now in the Days of Youth, you have fewer Hindrances, and greater Op∣portunities; and perhaps you have a long Time of growth before you. O Improve your singular Advantages: And fail no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the LORD of His righteous Expectations. How shame∣ful will it be for you to be outgrown by later Plants, than your selves? How ignominious
<PB N="63" REF="002256_0157_0FDADE712643C2D8"/>to be ourstript in the Christian Race by o∣thers that set out after you? And this will be the Event perhaps, if you are idle or trifl∣ing present. You will defeat one great De∣sign of your Early Conversion, by slack and sluggish Endeavors in Youth. O therefore follow Holiness now with active Zeal, cheer∣ful Vigour, and resolute Perseverance. Covet to <HI>excell,</HI> and strive to out-run, to out-do, &amp; out shine others. This is a laudable Emu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ation, a happy Contention, which GOD will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rown with Approbation and Success. O be∣gin betimes to aim at and reach after an emi∣nent Proficiency in Religion.</P>
<P>AND for this End; Maintain a <HI>humble Sense</HI> of your Need of further Sanctification, and mourn under the Reliques of Corruption in you.— And be <HI>much</HI> in the <HI>Exercise</HI> of Grace. Repeated Acts corroborate the Habit. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t is perhaps a Day of small things with you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t present: But if you are diligent and con∣stant in the Exercising of Grace, you will make gradual Improvements toward Perfecti∣on. Be faithful in a Little; and unto him that hath shall be given, and he shall have Abundance.—Industriously <HI>use all proper Means.</HI> Observe all the Ordinances of GOD; and that with a View to and Desires of Growth in Grace. As new born Babes, desire the sincere Milk of the Word, that ye may grow there∣by. Carefully attend on the LORD'S Supper, which is a Means (when rightly used) ad∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>itably effective of Increase in Grace; but is
<PB N="64" REF="002256_0158_0FDADE77152F1498"/>too much neglected in these unhappy Times of Apostasy. Be frequent in devout Meditation, &amp; solemn Self-Examination. Learn to do all com∣mon actions after a godly Sort; have your Con∣versation much in Heaven, by often contempla∣ting on it, and by making it the main Scope and Design of your Actions. Keep the holy Ex∣ample of CHRIST ever in your Eye. Be also Followers of them, who thro' Faith and Pati∣ence inherit the Promises. Frequently renew your holy Resolutions.</P>
<P>Finally <HI>BE much in Prayer &amp; the Exercise of Faith,</HI> which p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rifyeth the Heart. Live de∣pendently on GOD in CHRIST. In the hum∣ble Sense of your own Wants and Weakness, have all your Reliance on the Father of Lights and seek to Him thro' Jesus Christ for all needful Aids &amp; Recruits of Grace continually. The Life you now live in the Flesh let it be by the Faith of the Son of GOD, in whom it hath pleased the Father all Fulness should dwell: Trust in Him (and in His Name pray to GOD) for confirming and quickening Influences; and for a Blessing on Ordinances and Providences, that all may work together for your spiritul Good. They that thus wait on the LORD, shall renew their Strength: They shall mount up with Wings as Eagles. They shall grow as the Lilie and cast forth their Roots as Le∣banon, and their Leaf shall not wither.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="002256_0158_0FDADE77152F1498"/>
NOW our LORD JESUS CHRIST Himself, and GOD even our Father, who hath Loved us, and hath given us everlasting Consolation, and good Hope through Grace, Comfort your Hearts, and stablish you in every good Word and Work: And We pray GOD your whole Spirit and Soul and Body be preserved blame∣less unto the Coming of our LORD JESUS CHRIST; that the Name of CHRIST may be glorifyed in you and ye in Him. Faithful is He that hath called you, who also will do it. To Him be Glory both Now and for Ever.</P>

<HEAD>MANTISSA.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Eight Sermons</HI> on EARLY PIETY, which are here Exhibited, were coming abroad; the Ministers who Preached them waited on their Venerable <HI>Father</HI> Dr. INCREASE MA∣THER, with a Request, that he would permit Some Dis∣course of <HI>His</HI> on that Important Subject, tho' never so short an One, to be Ushered in by <HI>Theirs;</HI> which he might Let fall as a <HI>Mantle</HI> to us, now GOD is quickly <HI>taking him away from our Head.</HI> In answer to their Desire, (tho' he has already Cultivated the Subject in se∣veral Treatises, especially, his, <HI>Call to the Rising Gene∣ration,</HI> which have been formerly Published, and some of them have had several Editions;) he Preached the short Sermon, that is now to fasten the <HI>Nails,</HI> that have been in the preceding Essays.</P>
<P>IT must be Considered, That this is a Sermon of most <HI>uncommon Circumstances;</HI> Being of One who is in the <HI>Eighty Third</HI> Year of his Age, and who may say, <HI>Au<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>∣te Senem Juvenes, quem Juvenen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Senes audierunt:</HI> And as at this very Great Age, the Servant of GOD Preaches, (which he has done all his Days) without <HI>Using</HI> any <HI>Notes,</HI> thus also he does it sometimes almost without <HI>Writing</HI> any. Nor could we have come at this particu∣lar Sermon, if we had not been beholden to the Pen of a pious Gentlewoman belonging to his Flock, who gives us this Copy of what the <HI>Ready-Writer</HI> took from him, as he delivered it.</P>

That the Sons of <HI>Samuel</HI> did <HI>not walk in his ways. Samuel</HI> was grown Aged, and made use of his own <HI>Sons</HI> for his Assistence in the Government; hoping that they would <HI>walk in his Ways;</HI> but they did <HI>otherways.</HI> Wherefore the Elders of <HI>Israel</HI> came in a whole Body to <HI>Samuel,</HI> and complain'd to him of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Government of his Family.</P>
<P>'Tis a <HI>Sad Observation,</HI> which we have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow before us,</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002256_0160_0FDADE7A0B136B30"/>
THAT <HI>the Sons of Good Men do not always walk in the Good Ways which their Fathers have walked in.</HI></P>
<P>WE shall consider this DOCTRINE in se∣veral <HI>Propositions.</HI></P>
<P>THE First Proposition. <HI>All Good Men do walk in the same way.</HI> It is that which is called the <HI>way of Good Men,</HI> Prov. 2.20. <HI>Walk in the way of good Men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</HI> It is also called the <HI>Old Way,</HI> and the <HI>way that is holy,</HI> (Jer. 6.16.) It is like∣wise called, <HI>The way Everlasting,</HI> (Psal. 139.24.) because Good Men have <HI>always walked</HI> in that way; from the beginning of the World Good Men have always chosen to <HI>walk</HI> in that <HI>way; Chosen</HI> that <HI>Way of Truth,</HI> laying the <HI>Judg∣ments</HI> of GOD before them.</P>
<P>Particularly First; IT is the <HI>Way of Piety.</HI> They have always like <HI>Samuel Worshipped God</HI> and Him <HI>only;</HI> and have been careful not to <HI>take the Name of GOD in vain;</HI> and have <HI>Sanctifyed the holy Sabbaths</HI> of GOD: Yea, <HI>Sanctifying the Sabbath</HI> is indeed so great a part of <HI>Piety</HI> that it is put for <HI>all Religion,</HI> (Isai. 58.13.)</P>
<P>Secondly, IT is the <HI>way of Righteousness.</HI> They are conscienciously careful to observe the <HI>First Table</HI> of the <HI>Moral</HI> Law, and the <HI>Second Table</HI> also. Therefore <HI>Paul</HI> could say, Acts 24.16. <HI>Herein do I exercise my self to have always a Conscience void of effence toward God and toward Men.</HI> Thus it was with <HI>Samuel;</HI> he was <HI>upright,</HI> he could <HI>appeal</HI> to the People as in the 12th. Chapter of this Book; <HI>Have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="3" REF="002256_0160_0FDADE7A0B136B30"/>wronged any Man?</HI> And they <HI>all</HI> said, <HI>No, thou hast wronged no Man.</HI> But then <HI>his Sons,</HI> they were very <HI>unrighteous;</HI> they did run after <HI>Filthy Lucre,</HI> they <HI>took bribes;</HI> they <HI>perverted Judgment;</HI> which was quite contrary to what their Father did.</P>
<P>Thirdly, IT is the Way of <HI>Prayerfulness.</HI> Thus <HI>Samuel</HI> said to the People; <HI>God forbid that I should cease to pray for you.</HI> Good Men are <HI>Praying</HI> Men. Psal. 24.6. <HI>This is the genera∣tion of them that seek him.</HI> They that seek the Face of GOD are the <HI>Generation</HI> that belong to Him Yea, there is not one <HI>Godly Man</HI> in all the World but what is a <HI>Praying Man.</HI> Psal. 32.6. <HI>For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee.</HI> As for those that are <HI>Prayerless,</HI> they are mention'd among the <HI>workers of Iniquity,</HI> (Psal. 14.4.) If they are Prayerless they are so to be accounted. Thus we see in short, the <HI>Good Ways,</HI> that <HI>Good Men</HI> are forever found walk∣ing in; The ways of a <HI>Samuel!</HI></P>
<P>PROP. II. THE <HI>Children</HI> of Godly Men have <HI>peculiar Advantages</HI> to serve the <HI>God of their Fathers,</HI> and walk in the <HI>Good Ways</HI> which their <HI>Fathers</HI> walked in: Divers Advantages which <HI>other Children</HI> in the World have not. As now,</P>
<P>First, THEY have the <HI>Scriptures;</HI> they have the <HI>Word of God</HI> to direct them in the way of Life &amp; Salvation. As is said concerning the <HI>Jews,</HI> Rom. 3.1, 2. <HI>What advantage hath the Jew? much every way; chiefly in that unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</HI> They had the Holy Scriptures. Thus it was said of
<PB N="4" REF="002256_0161_0FDADE7B8E5AA308"/><HI>Timothy:</HI> he was advantaged in that respect above others, 2 Tim. 3.15. <HI>From a Child thou hast known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make wise unto Salvation.</HI> They have also the Word of God <HI>Preached</HI> unto them; as the <HI>written Word</HI> of God, so the <HI>Gospel Preached</HI> unto them: That is a great Advantage; the <HI>Preaching</HI> of the Gospel is the ordinary means by which true <HI>Faith</HI> in the Lord Jesus Christ is wrought in the Souls of His Elect. Rom. 10.27. <HI>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</HI> In that regard, the Children of Godly Men have special Advantages to <HI>know the God of their Fathers.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; THEY are the Subjects of <HI>Pa∣rental Instructions,</HI> they are taught by their Parents how they ought to serve God. Thus the Lord required his People of Old; <HI>Thou shalt teach thy Children diligently my Command∣ments,</HI> Deut. 6.7. And in Psal. 78.5, 6. it is there said, <HI>They should teach their Childdren from one generation to another.</HI> And the Lord said concerning <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. 18.19. <HI>I know Abraham, that he will teach his Children to keep the way of the Lord.</HI> Now they that are the Children of <HI>Abraham</HI> will do the <HI>Works of Abraham.</HI> So we find the Servants of God have always done. <HI>David,</HI> he taught his Son <HI>Solomon</HI> &amp; his other Children. He said, Psal. 34.11. <HI>Come ye Children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</HI> And his Son <HI>Solomon</HI> says, Prov. 4.3, 4. <HI>I was my fathers son, he taught me.</HI> So did his Godly <HI>Mother</HI> too, she
<PB N="5" REF="002256_0161_0FDADE7B8E5AA308"/>was careful to Instruct him. We read how his Godly Mother Instructed him. Prov. 31.2. <HI>What? my son, and what? the son of my vows?</HI> Said she, I have <HI>Vowed</HI> and <HI>Prayed</HI> to God ma∣ny a time for thee, and wilt thou not hear the Counsel of her that has so often <HI>Prayed</HI> for thee and <HI>Vowed</HI> and offer'd many Sacrifices to God on thy behalf?</P>
<P>Thirdly. THE People of GOD, put up many <HI>Prayers</HI> for their Children, that God would give them His Grace; they <HI>Pray</HI> at that rate, 1 Chron. 29.19. <HI>Give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart.</HI> Thus <HI>Abraham</HI> Prayed for <HI>Ishma∣el,</HI> and God said, <HI>concerning Ishmael I have heard thee.</HI> Their Advantages are Peculiar in that respect, in that they are <HI>Prayed for.</HI> Lastly, They have the <HI>Blessing</HI> of their <HI>Parents;</HI> which is not a light thing. The <HI>Blessing</HI> of a <HI>Father</HI> is not to be despised; it ought to be regarded. We see <HI>Esau</HI> as bad as he was, yet when he saw he was deprived of his <HI>Father Blessing,</HI> be <HI>Wept, and made a great and bitter Cry</HI> upon it. Verily, 'tis a Considerable, a Valuable Thing for Children to have their pious Parents, im∣ploring and pronouncing of <HI>Blessings</HI> upon them in the Name of the LORD. So that the <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> of <HI>Godly Parents</HI> have Advantages which <HI>other Children</HI> in the World are Strangers to.</P>
<P>PROP. III. <HI>MANY</HI> Children of Godly Pa∣rents, do prove Godly too, and walk in the <HI>Good Ways</HI> of their Parents; yet it is too often sadly otherwise. Some well Observe, God has so cast the <HI>Line of Election</HI> that for the most
<PB N="6" REF="002256_0162_0FDADE8111A4C8E0"/>part it runs through the Loins of <HI>Godly Parents.</HI> The 2d Epistle of <HI>John</HI> is, <HI>to the elect lady</HI> and her <HI>Children.</HI> If so be the Mother is <HI>elected</HI> there is more Hope and Encouragement that the Children belong to the <HI>Election</HI> too. We read, Psal. 103.17. <HI>The mercy of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that fear him, his righteousness unto childrens children.</HI> Thus <HI>Paul</HI> says concerning <HI>Timothy,</HI> [2 Tim. 1.5.] <HI>I am perswaded</HI> says he, <HI>that Faith is in thee;</HI> that thou art a true Believer; when I call to Re∣membrance the <HI>Faith</HI> that was in thy <HI>Grand-mother Lois,</HI> and thy <HI>Mother Eunice.</HI> Thy <HI>Grand-mother</HI> was a Godly Woman, thy <HI>Mother</HI> an holy Woman; therefore I cannot but Hope the more for thee. Doubtless, if an account of it were taken, it would be found that the <HI>greatest part</HI> of such as belong to God have de∣scended from <HI>Godly Parents.</HI></P>
<P>PROP. IV. BUT still the Grace of God is <HI>Sovereign.</HI> It is not engaged to any <HI>Parti∣cular Family;</HI> He is <HI>free</HI> in the Disposing of his Grace. He says, Exod. 33.19. <HI>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will shew mercy on whom I will sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w mercy.</HI> So that many <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> that descend from Godly Parents are not Godly but much otherwise, this is a sad Truth. And now, will First, Show the <HI>Proof</HI> of it; then <HI>inquire whence</HI> it comes to pass. For the <HI>Proof</HI> of it,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE find in the Scripture <HI>Particular Fa∣milies,</HI> many of them did degenerate from the Faith of their Forefathers. Let us look back
<PB N="7" REF="002256_0162_0FDADE8111A4C8E0"/>as far as <HI>Adam</HI>'s Family, and we shall find it so. <HI>Adam</HI> had a Godly Son whose Name was <HI>Seth,</HI> now the Posterity of that Godly Son in process of Time did Degenerate and became as the rest of the World, Gen. 6.2. <HI>The sons of God saw the daughters of men.</HI> The <HI>Sons of God,</HI> that is to say the Posterity of Godly <HI>Seth;</HI> they did Degenerate and became like the rest of the World. <HI>Noah</HI> had a Godly Son, <HI>scil. Shem,</HI> but this Man's Posterity did sadly Degene∣rate; Notice is taken of it, that they became <HI>Idolaters,</HI> [Josh. 24.2.] In <HI>Abrahams</HI> Family there was an <HI>Ishmael</HI> that would Scoff at his Brother who was a Godly Man. In <HI>Isaac</HI>'s Fa∣mily was an <HI>Esau</HI> who was a prophane Person. So says the Apostle, <HI>Take heed lest there be a∣mong you a prophane person like unto Esau that for a mess of pottage sold his birthright.</HI> In <HI>David</HI>'s Family; How many wicked Sons sprung up in that good Man's Family! An <HI>Amnon,</HI> who Committed Incest with his own Sister; An <HI>Ab∣salom</HI> that Murdered his Brother <HI>Amnon,</HI> and after that would have Murdered his own Fa∣ther to have gained the Kingdom! Is it not said of <HI>Nabal,</HI> who was a <HI>drunken Sot,</HI> that he was of <HI>the house of Caleb?</HI> [1 Sam. 25.3.] A sad thing that so vile a wretch as <HI>Nabal</HI> was should descend from such an house as <HI>Calebs</HI> was! <HI>Josiah</HI> was a Godly Man; yet his Chil∣dren <HI>all of them bad!</HI> God said to one of them, <HI>Did not thy Father do judgment and justice! But thine heart is for thy Covetousness.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. IT is true concerning <HI>whole Generations.</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002256_0163_0FDADE8248690F98"/>Sometimes <HI>whole Generations</HI> have Apostatized from God and become exceeding Sinful in his Sight; So when <HI>Joshua</HI> was Dead it is said, Judg. 2.10. <HI>There arose another generation which knew not the Lord, nor the works which he had done.</HI> A <HI>whole Generation</HI> did Degenerate from the Piety of their Fathers that had gone before them. <HI>I planted thee a noble Vine, but how art thou degenerate, saith the Lord?</HI> Jer. 2.25.</P>
<P>BUT now Secondly; <HI>Whence</HI> is it that <HI>god∣ly</HI> Men sometimes have very <HI>ungodly Children!</HI> For answer; First: The Children of godly Men are <HI>born Sinful,</HI> as well as the Children of <HI>other Men.</HI> They have <HI>Original Corruption</HI> in them as much as others have. Hence <HI>Da∣vid</HI> says, Psal. 51.5. <HI>I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.</HI> Yet <HI>Da∣vid</HI>'s Mother was a Singular good Woman; a very holy Woman. <HI>David</HI> when he prayed to God, says, <HI>Remember the Son of thine hand∣maid:</HI> his Father <HI>Jesse</HI> also was a very holy Man; the Jews call him, <HI>Jesse the Righteous:</HI> And have such an Opinion of him, that they Hyperbolically say, the <HI>Angel of Death</HI> could find no Sin, but that of our <HI>First Parents,</HI> to charge him with. The Son of a <HI>godly Father,</HI> and a <HI>godly Mother,</HI> yet was <HI>conceived</HI> in <HI>Sin and shapen in Iniquity.</HI> Such are as apt to Sin as the Children of ungodly Men; they are apt to <HI>tell lies as scon as they are born:</HI> when they commit a Fault they are <HI>apt to tell a Lie,</HI> because of the Corruption which is natural to them; yea, they are <HI>Inventers of evil
<PB N="9" REF="002256_0163_0FDADE8248690F98"/>things,</HI> Rom. 1.30. They are apt to commit such Sins, as never any did before them. They are apt to do amifs and to fall in with the Ways of Sin.</P>
<P>Secondly. THIS comes to pass from the Malice of <HI>Satan,</HI> that does what he can to cor∣rupt the Churches. Among the <HI>Wheat</HI> there springs up a world of <HI>Tares.</HI> How comes this to pass? Why says the Text, <HI>an Enemy has done it.</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> is that <HI>Enemy;</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> is an <HI>Enemy</HI> to Purity in Churches; he would have Churches to be like the rest of the World: Therefore he sows <HI>Tares</HI> in the Lord's Field. He does it, in the <HI>Degeneracy</HI> that he Labours to introduce among the <HI>Children of the Covenant.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. IT comes to pass from the <HI>remo∣val</HI> of Eminent Servants of GOD. Thus when <HI>Moses</HI> was going to be taken away, <HI>I know,</HI> says he, <HI>after my Death there will be great</HI> chan∣ges among you. Thus <HI>Paul,</HI> when going from <HI>Ephesus,</HI> says, <HI>after my Departure there will come grievous wolves among you.</HI> And how of∣ten is it said in the book of <HI>Judges, while the good Judges continued,</HI> things went well, but <HI>when those good Judges were dead,</HI> and removed out of the Way, they presently Degenerated, and became like the rest of the World; be∣came guilty of such Sins as others in the World were Guilty of. Thus we see the <HI>Doc∣trine</HI> cleared in the Particulars that have been mentioned.</P>

<HEAD>APPLICATION.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. HENCE we see, Men ought not to set their Hearts inordinately upon their <HI>Children.</HI> Indeed they are apt to do so; apt to promise themselves much comfort in their Children. We see it in <HI>Abraham,</HI> says he, <HI>Lord, what wilt give one, seeing I go Childless?</HI> And it is threat∣ned as a Judgment, such a Man shall <HI>die Child∣less.</HI> We see it in <HI>Rachel, Give me Children or else I die:</HI> God <HI>gave</HI> her <HI>Children,</HI> and <HI>she died</HI> for it: And when her <HI>Soul was departing,</HI> she called his name <HI>Benoni,</HI> that is, <HI>the Child of my Affliction.</HI> Indeed when the <HI>Children</HI> of the Faithful <HI>die</HI> in their <HI>Infancy,</HI> there is cause to Hope they are Saved because of the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD; the Covenant of Grace which they have not Violated. But when they <HI>Out Live</HI> their <HI>Infancy,</HI> and become Wicked and Vile, the case is much otherwise. Wherefore <HI>Pa∣rents</HI> who know not how their Children may prove, should not set their Hearts inordinate∣ly upon their <HI>Children. Who knows,</HI> but that <HI>Child</HI> thou art so fond of may prove to thee as <HI>Esau</HI> did to <HI>Rebecca</HI> and to his <HI>Father?</HI> He was a <HI>grief of Mind</HI> to them both. And <HI>Rebec∣ca</HI> said, <HI>I am weary of my Life because of the Daughters of Heth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. IF the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Good Men</HI> may prove <HI>ungodly,</HI> no wonder that the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>unged∣ly Men</HI> do so. <HI>Children</HI> are more apt to imi∣tate their Parents in that which is <HI>Evil,</HI> than in that which is <HI>Good.</HI> Jer. 7.18. <HI>The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the
<PB N="11" REF="002256_0164_0FDADE83C538DA60"/>women knead the dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven.</HI> Abominable! To <HI>make cakes to the queen of heaven;</HI> to Worship the <HI>Moon!</HI> yet when <HI>Parents</HI> did so, the <HI>Children</HI> did so too; and no wonder they did. The <HI>Samaritans</HI> that succeeded those that were carried Captive, they Worshipped graven Images and Served other gods; <HI>as their Fathers did, so did their Children, and their Childrens Children; as did their Fathers so do they unto this Day,</HI> 2 King. 17.41. Those Children that did mock the holy Prophet <HI>Elisha,</HI> that said, <HI>go up thou bald head; go up thou bald head;</HI> thou sayest thy Master <HI>Elijah</HI> is <HI>gone up</HI> to Heaven; <HI>do thou go after him;</HI> would these <HI>Children</HI> have done so, if they had not seen the Iniquity of their <HI>Fathers?</HI> Doubtless their Fathers were guilty of the like Iniquity.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>WE may see by this, it is not in the pow∣er of Parents to give Grace to their Children.</HI> They may give them what they have of this World; but that's all. To have <HI>Grace</HI> given to them, it is a thousand times better, far more desireable than to have a portion of <HI>this Worlds Goods.</HI> But this is more than <HI>they</HI> can Give. They can't give them <HI>Sanctifying Grace;</HI> they can't give them <HI>true Repentance;</HI> that is the <HI>Gift of GOD,</HI> not of their <HI>Parents.</HI> They can't give them <HI>Faith</HI> in JESUS CHRIST; no <HI>that,</HI> none but <HI>GOD</HI> can give. A godly Man can no more make his <HI>Children godly</HI> than he can <HI>Raise the Dead</HI> out of their Graves: It is none but God can do it: <HI>He</HI> alone must have the Praise and Glory of it.</P>

IV. IT is not safe for <HI>Children</HI> to build up∣on having an <HI>Abraham</HI> for their <HI>Father.</HI> Mat. 3.9. <HI>Think not to say within your selves we have Abraham for our Father.</HI> This is a Foundation not to be built upon, thou mayst have a <HI>Father</HI> as good a Man as <HI>Abraham,</HI> and yet Perish for ever in thy Unbelief. How was it with one who died and went to <HI>Hell,</HI> and when <HI>in Tor∣ments</HI> there he cried out, <HI>Father Abraham have mercy on me!</HI> This Child of <HI>Abraham</HI> in Tor∣ments, adds, <HI>I have five Brethren alive in the World, O that one might go from the Dead,</HI> and tell them what a terrible place <HI>Hell</HI> is, that they mayn't come into this <HI>place of Torment.</HI> Why? Is there any <HI>Charity</HI> in <HI>Hell?</HI> No, but they know if their <HI>Brethren</HI> come there it would be worse for them, an aggravation of their Misery! Therefore hebeg'd, O <HI>let not them come here!</HI> Well then, you that are the <HI>Chil∣dren of Godly Parents,</HI> I shall Speak a Solemn Word unto you. If thou Livest and Diest in thine <HI>Impenitency</HI> thou shalt have the most <HI>ter∣rible Witnesses</HI> against thee. Thy <HI>Father,</HI> and thy <HI>Mother</HI> that Lov'd thee so Dearly, that has wept and prayed for thee so many times, thy <HI>Father,</HI> and thy <HI>Mother,</HI> they will Condemn thee, they will Justify GOD in Condemning of thee: <HI>they</HI> will join with the LORD in passing a Sentence of Eternal Condemnation upon thee at the Last Day; and say, like the Angel in the <HI>Revelations, Thou art Righteous in that Thou hast so Judged:</HI> Thus it will be said at the Last Day: Thy <HI>Father,</HI> and thy <HI>Mother</HI> will say,
<PB N="13" REF="002256_0165_0FDADE8A4B8EC550"/><HI>Lord I Concur with Thee, thou art Righteous in passing a Sentence of Eternal Condemnation upon this Child of mine; I warn'd him many a Time to Repent and turn to God, but he would not, so that Thou art Righteous in all that is come upon him.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. THE <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Godly Men</HI> should be careful that they <HI>themselves be Godly.</HI> Now the Children of <HI>New-England</HI> are (or, <HI>once were</HI>) for the most part the Children of <HI>Godly Men.</HI> What did our Fathers come into this Wilder∣ness for? Not to <HI>gain Estates,</HI> as Men do now, but for <HI>Religion,</HI> &amp; that they might leave their <HI>Children</HI> in a hopeful way of being truly <HI>Reli∣gious.</HI> There was a famous Man that Preach't before One of the Greatest Assemblies that e∣ver was Preach'd unto, Seventy Years ago, and he told them, <HI>I have liv'd in a Country Se∣ven Years, and all that time I never heard one Pro∣phane Oath, and all that time I never did see a Man Drunk in that Land.</HI> Where was that Country? It was <HI>New-England! New-England! New-England!</HI> But, Ah, Degenerate <HI>New-England,</HI> what art thou come to at <HI>this Day?</HI> How are those Sins become <HI>common</HI> in thee, that once were not so much as heard of in this Land? A sad thing it is! Well then, O turn to GOD, you that are <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Godly Parents.</HI> Remember that God calls you to it. Now He calls you to it in a Solemn Way by a <HI>grie∣vous Disease,</HI> He has sent into this Town, which how far it may proceed we know not. Is not God Speaking to you <HI>Now?</HI> It will be
<PB N="14" REF="002256_0166_0FDADE8C21B27ED0"/>a wonder it that the <HI>Slain</HI> of <HI>the Lord</HI> are not very <HI>Many</HI> e're this Disease be over. Chil∣dren, You are concerned to turn to God, to make sure of a CHRIST. <HI>Then</HI> you shall be happy; nothing else can make you happy; you cannot be sure of your <HI>Lives:</HI> You may make sure of a CHRIST. If you make sure of <HI>Him,</HI> you will be happy whatever befals you.</P>
<P>WELL, <HI>What shall we do to make sure of This?</HI> A few Solemn Words let me speak to you, and so I leave you.</P>
<P N="1">1. SEEK to God <HI>betimes.</HI> You read, Prov. 8.17. <HI>They that seek me early shall me.</HI> O that there may be many <HI>Early <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eckers</HI> of God, ma∣ny that set themselves in good earnest to <HI>Seek</HI> Him. When you <HI>Seek God,</HI> plead with Him the <HI>Relation</HI> wherewith you are Advantaged, as sometimes <HI>Jacob</HI> did, <HI>O God of my Father A∣braham, O God of my Father Isaac;</HI> my <HI>Father</HI> and my <HI>Grandfather,</HI> did seek thy Face; <HI>they</HI> were thy Servants; <HI>O let me be so too.</HI> And remember the Solemn Exhortation that <HI>David</HI> gave to his Son <HI>Solomon,</HI> 1 Chron. 28.9. <HI>Thou Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and a willing mind, if thou seek him he will be found of thee, but if thou for sake him be will cast thee off forever.</HI> Say not, we <HI>cannot Convert</HI> our selves; Well, but don't do that which will <HI>hinder</HI> your Con∣version? Don't hearken to <HI>Evil Counsel.</HI> We read in the Scripture of <HI>Ahaziah,</HI> after the Death of his Father, <HI>the house of Ahab were his Counsellours to his destruction.</HI> Remember that
<PB N="15" REF="002256_0166_0FDADE8C21B27ED0"/>Scripture, Prov. 13.20. <HI>He that walketh with the wise shall be wise, but a companion of fools shall be destroyed.</HI> O let not any of you be a <HI>Com∣panion</HI> of such; if you love your Souls beware of <HI>Vain Company:</HI> For there is nothing more <HI>destructive</HI> to the Souls of Men than <HI>that.</HI> If thou choose to follow them, they will be thy ruin, they will u do thee forever.</P>
<P N="2">2. WAIT on God in the use of His own <HI>Means,</HI> that He would be Merciful to you. Therefore Give diligent Attention, even an <HI>Earnest H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed</HI> unto the Word of GOD, when it is Preach'd unto you. Don't set your selves to <HI>sleep at Sermons.</HI> I remember, there was a Man Died in this Place many Years ago, who Died in doleful Despair; this Man when Dy∣ing said to me, <HI>Sometimes I set my self to Sleep on purpose when you have been Preaching,</HI> and do you think there <HI>is any Mercy for me?</HI> Yes, there was Mercy for him if he Repented; but he Died in <HI>doleful Despair.</HI> Take heed of set∣ting your selves to <HI>Sleep,</HI> when you should be <HI>Hearing</HI> as for your <HI>Lives,</HI> as for your <HI>Souls.</HI> And then also, <HI>Cry to God</HI> that He would have Mercy on you, do as <HI>Paul;</HI> when in the Pangs of the New Birth it is said of him, <HI>Behold he prays!</HI> Doubtless <HI>Saul</HI> prayed many a time be∣fore <HI>that;</HI> he was a <HI>Pharisee;</HI> the <HI>Pharisees</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten prayed; but he did not <HI>pray in Earnest,</HI> now he prayed in good Ear est, as if his <HI>Soul</HI> was concerned, as indeed it was. Pray as for thy Life and Soul, and God will hear and ans∣wer thee.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002256_0167_0FDAC97ED75C7800" MS="y"/>
Lastly. DO not <HI>Quench</HI> the Spirit of God. It is complain'd of the Jews, Acts 7.51. They <HI>Resisted the Spirit of God.</HI> That is a dangerous thing; to <HI>vex</HI> the Spirit of God; to <HI>grieve</HI> the Spirit of God! God has said, <HI>My Spirit shall not always strive.</HI> Dr. <HI>Preston</HI> speaks of a Man, that had been guilty of a <HI>great Sin,</HI> &amp; was trou∣bled very much that he had been guilty of such a Sin; he goes to a vile Companion, that gave him this wicked advice, than which Satan himself could not have given him worse; <HI>Go thy way, commit that Sin again, &amp; thou shalt be never trou∣bled more;</HI> that poor Wretch did so, &amp; he was <HI>never troubled more;</HI> God gave him up to a <HI>repro∣bate mind,</HI> to hardness of heart. Remember <HI>Saul;</HI> it is said, <HI>The Spirit of the Lord departed from him.</HI> And, <HI>wo to them, if I depart from them, saith the Lord.</HI> If you Sin against the <HI>strivings</HI> of God's Spirit, you may provoke him utterly to depart from you; But then, <HI>wo unto you!</HI> Think of an awful Scripture which I shall leave with you, for I knew a Man many Years ago, whose Con∣version to God was promoted by serious Medi∣tation on that very Scripture; Ezek. 24.13. <HI>Be∣cause I would have purged thee, &amp; thou wouldst not be purged, thou shalt not be purged any more, till I cause my fury to rest upon thee.</HI></P>
<P>NOW, may the <HI>GOD of our Fathers</HI> mercifully pre∣serve the Children of <HI>New-England,</HI> from that <HI>Apostacy,</HI> which may provoke Him to <HI>cast them off for ever.</HI> May He be <HI>with them,</HI> as He was with their <HI>Fathers,</HI> and help them to w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> in the <HI>Good Ways</HI> of their Fathers, and in that <HI>Faith &amp; Order of the Gospel</HI> which they walk'd in; and may He never <HI>Leave them nor Forsake them.</HI></P>
