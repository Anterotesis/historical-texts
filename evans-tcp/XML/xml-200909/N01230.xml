<HEAD>To the Honourable Judge SEWALL.</HEAD>
<P>THE ESSAY now before you, was made, because you have been Exercised with some Funerals in your Family; and especially One of a <HI>Daughter,</HI> falling Suddenly into the Arms of <HI>Death,</HI> a few Days after she had comforted you with the <HI>Birth</HI> of her First∣born Infant.</P>
<P><HI>Austin</HI> makes it his comfortable Observation, That when Good Men are <HI>in Mourning,</HI> or under any Calamity, they have Good Men at hand with Consolations. <HI>Ad sunt Boni Homines, qui flere cum flentibus norunt;</HI> and so, <HI>Leniuntur Aspera, relevantur Gravia, et Su∣perantur Adversa.</HI> T'wil be a Favour to me, if I may be found a∣mong those <HI>Boni Homines,</HI> who do the part of your Friends on such occasions. I shall, if a most hearty Affection to you and yours, and <HI>Weeping with you and them,</HI> can declare me so.</P>
<P>It was notably Proposed by <HI>Tully</HI> to his <HI>Atticus; Consolationum multae sunt viae; sed illa rectissima, Impetret</HI> Ratio <HI>quod</HI> Dies <HI>impetra∣tura est.</HI> This his Proposal, That <HI>Reason,</HI> without an <HI>Higher Prin∣ciple,</HI> should <HI>Immediately</HI> do that in a way of <HI>Consolation,</HI> which <HI>Length of Time</HI> uses to do, with a longer &amp; more tedious Procedure, is, <HI>To wash an Ethiopian.</HI> And it is related by <HI>Plutarch</HI> accordingly, concerning this Pretender to <HI>Reason,</HI> That when his Daughter <HI>Tulliola</HI> died, <HI>Mortem indignissime tulit.</HI></P>
<P>You are furnished with the <HI>Higher Principle</HI> of RELIGION; and you are acquainted with the <HI>Great Consolations of GOD,</HI> which you know how to apply on the proper occasions. <HI>These will do.</HI></P>
<P>As the <HI>Chymists</HI> tell us, That <HI>Nature</HI> by <HI>Length of Time</HI> changes one Metal into another; but their Skill and Boast is to Accelerate the Endeavours of <HI>Nature,</HI> and Hasten <HI>at Once</HI> the Effect, which else
<PB REF="001467_0003_0FB34ABCEC972170"/>
would have been a very long while producing. Thus, <HI>Religion</HI> will with much more certainty <HI>at Once</HI> bring about that Victory over Sorrow, and fix the Mind in that <HI>Golden Temper,</HI> which else would not be so soon accomplished.</P>
<P>For your Assistence in that <HI>Work of Christianity,</HI> You have called for a Copy of my Essay; which now wears a Name, that may signify, <HI>The Consolations of GOD;</HI> and it was my Duty to let it wait upon you.</P>
<P>I Remember Two Passages in an <HI>Epistle Consolatory,</HI> of the Great <HI>Grotius</HI> unto the Baron <HI>Maurier,</HI> on the Death of a Relative, which I thought not unworthy to be Remembred, and now Repeted.</P>
<P>The One is; <HI>Confer now with the Dead, and Peruse BOOKS with greater Diligence than ever. BOOKS will not only give you a Safe Retreat from the Fury of your Enemy, but will arm you also against the Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>The Other is, <HI>I am assured, there can be no better Remedy applied unto Sorrow, than that which the Great Physician of Souls, among the infinite Treasures of Saving Wisdom, has brought down from Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Behold, a Little <HI>Book,</HI> which presents you with these best of <HI>Remedies.</HI></P>
<P>It was the Custom of my Memorable Grand-father COTTON, to Read Something of his most valuable &amp; venerable CALVIN, in his Evening Studies; for which he would say, <HI>I love to sweeten my Mouth, with a piece of</HI> CALVIN, <HI>before I go to Sleep.</HI> I know, you love your Incomparable CALVIN, as much as the <HI>Papists,</HI> and <HI>Pe∣lagians,</HI> and <HI>High fliers,</HI> do Hate him; and you are a Great Reader of him. To such a <HI>Calvinist,</HI> it will not be Ungrateful for me, (who am one too) to recite these two Passages, from a Sermon of his, upon that Paragraph in <HI>Job,</HI> from whence the <HI>Text</HI> of mine is taken.</P>
<P>The first, this. <HI>Sedulo notemus, nobis Perplexis et Anxijs nihil Superesse, quo Tranquillitatem Consequamur, nisi ut Deus nos Pacatos, et Contentos reddat; quod Beneficium, Pluris facere quam caetera omnia, debemus. Deus Sese modo ostendat, et statim Turbae omnes discutientur.</HI></P>
<P>The second, this. <HI>Hoc autem in Praxi magis quam in verbis consistit; Nam qui ad Deum confugiunt, norunt quanti sint Consolationes, et quantum ad nos Pacandos valeant.</HI> With this Piece of CALVIN, I take leave; and Subscribe,</P>

<HEAD>NEHEMIAH. OR, THE GREAT <HI>Consolations of</HI> GOD.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JOB XV. 11.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Are the Consolations of <HI>GOD,</HI> Small with thee?</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT is a Smart Question! And it is a Matter of <HI>no Small</HI> Sor∣row, <HI>no Small</HI> Horror, that we generally afford so <HI>Great</HI> Rea∣son, to be rebuked with such a Question. The Rebuke may be more justly given to <HI>us,</HI> than it was to <HI>Job,</HI> the Upright and Patient Servant of the Lord. A man enough to have made any <HI>Arabia</HI> the <HI>Happy,</HI> by his Illuminating of it; and yet a Man greatly Misconstrued, Censured, Reproached. We have the Story of him in a <HI>Poem,</HI> which had an <HI>Historical Foundation;</HI> whe∣ther <HI>Moses</HI> wrote the <HI>Poem</HI> or no, for the comfort of his Country∣men, while he was yet among the <HI>Midianites,</HI> cannot be deter∣mined. It may, that <HI>Senault</HI> sayes true, <HI>No Book in the World, is nobler in Expressions, richer in Descriptions, more generous in Concep∣tions, or more natural in Comparisons.</HI> The Friends of this rare man, too Angry &amp; Froward ones! had been counselling of him, to Turn from the <HI>Impiety</HI> and <HI>Hypocrisy,</HI> whereof they would needs, upon cause little enough, suspect him to be Guilty. They had been comfor∣ting of him also with Hopes to find Favour with God upon his Turn. He endeavours his own <HI>Vindication</HI> from the Suspicion of his
<PB N="2" REF="001467_0005_0FB34ABFA56355B8"/>
Friends: His just <HI>Vindication,</HI> does but add unto the <HI>Irritation.</HI> So tis, when men Resolve, that nothing shall satisfy them! They misinterpret him, as if he had Rejected the <HI>Encouragements</HI> of Re∣turning to GOD, which they had set before him. The <HI>Expostula∣tion</HI> on this occasion (made, as <HI>Mercer</HI> thinks, with State enough!) is this; <HI>Are the Consolations of God Small with thee?</HI> The Inten∣tion of it, is well expressed by the Incomparable <HI>Calvin; Si quid tale aliquis committerit, merito haberetur superbus, et Dei Gratiae contemptor non ferendus.</HI> In short, Intolerable the <HI>Pride</HI> and <HI>Ingra∣titude</HI> of doing so. Whatever mistake there might be in their Ap∣plication to the censured Servant of God, I will see, that there shall be no mistake in my Application of the Words, unto the purpose of the DOCTRINE, which I am going to take into my Hands.</P>
<P>Tis this,
<Q>Very Great are the Provocations of Men unto <HI>GOD,</HI> when the Consolations of <HI>GOD</HI> are but Small unto them.</Q></P>
<P>If the <HI>Consolations of</HI> GOD appear <HI>Little</HI> to us, our <HI>Indiscretion</HI> is more than a <HI>Little;</HI> our <HI>Iniquity</HI> more than a <HI>Little.</HI> When the <HI>Consolations of</HI> GOD are of <HI>Small</HI> Account with men, or make <HI>Little Impression</HI> on them, have <HI>Little Efficacy</HI> on them, tis a <HI>Sign</HI> and a <HI>Cause</HI> of <HI>no Small Evil</HI> in them; of more than a Little <HI>Folly</HI> and <HI>Evil</HI> in them.</P>
<P>There are <HI>Three Assertions</HI> to be advanced and maintained. When we have Established our <HI>Three Assertions,</HI> we shall be ready to bring on a very <HI>forcible Expostulation,</HI> with some <HI>Right words,</HI> wherein it will be well, if we don't find our selves all concerned.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> There are <HI>Consolations of</HI> GOD, belonging unto all the People of God; offered unto all the Children of Men. <HI>Comfortable things</HI> are to be Enjoy'd by all <HI>Good Men;</HI> The Enjoyment of those <HI>Com∣fortable Things</HI> is tendered unto <HI>all men.</HI></P>
<P>I will presently tell you <HI>What</HI> these <HI>Consolations</HI> are. But I can∣not well come to thee until we first of all take Notice <HI>Whose</HI> they are.</P>
<P>Take Notice then, in the first Place, That all <HI>True Consolations</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="001467_0006_0FB34AC1C7FC24C8"/>
are the <HI>Consolations of</HI> GOD. We read, 2 Cor. I. 3. <HI>He is the God of all Comfort.</HI> There are <HI>Comfortable Creatures; Comforts</HI> in <HI>Crea∣tures:</HI> But they are no further so, than GOD shall please to make them so. All <HI>Creatures</HI> otherwise at the best, are but <HI>Miserable Comforters.</HI> The Great GOD has more Sublime, Celestial, Rap∣turous <HI>Consolations</HI> for us, than any of this World; <HI>Consolations</HI> of a Finer Composition, than any this World can afford <HI>Matter</HI> for. Indeed some Interpreters as old as the <HI>Vulgar Latin,</HI> thus carry the Sense of the clause, I am now Preaching upon; q. d. <HI>Is it not an easy thing with God to Comfort thee?</HI> And if we do find any <HI>Con∣solations</HI> in any Entertainments, which this World may afford unto us, they still are <HI>Gifts</HI> of GOD; <HI>the Things which</HI> GOD <HI>has graci∣ously given to His Servant!</HI> They are <HI>Consolations,</HI> which GOD has provided; and they would not have the least Relish of <HI>Consolati∣ons</HI> in them, if GOD should not enable us to relish them. We read, Job XXXIV. 29. <HI>When He gives Quietness, who then can make Trou∣ble? And when He hides His Face, who then can behold Him?</HI> I will say, If GOD withold Consolations, who is there that can Pretend to <HI>Comfort?</HI> Indeed the Best Things in the World, without GOD, are but as <HI>Luther</HI> Elegantly called them, <HI>Consolatiunculae creaturulae:</HI> Very Diminutive Consolations! Abundance of <HI>Duty,</HI> will imme∣diately arise unto us from this Acknowledgment.</P>
<P>Would we be made Partakers of any <HI>Consolations?</HI> Go to GOD for them. Trust in GOD for them. Keep in Good Terms with GOD. O all you, who Desire <HI>Comfort;</HI> Do not <HI>Offend</HI> GOD, if you would have Him to <HI>Comfort</HI> you. All <HI>Comfort</HI> is lost and gone and Confiscated, when we ly under the <HI>Anger</HI> of GOD. Are we made Partakers of any Consolations? O <HI>Comforted</HI> Ones; Own them to be the Consolations of GOD. Give GOD the Glory of them; Glorify GOD, as the Author and Giver of them.</P>
<P>I am now ready to Proceed on my Essay, to declare, <HI>What</HI> are the Consolations of GOD?</P>
<P>Inexpressible <HI>Consolations!</HI> All that we can <HI>Express</HI> of them, is only in some General Heads, whereof we have been advised from the <HI>Lively Oracles.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001467_0007_0FB34AC2A34330F0"/>First; There are <HI>Consolations of</HI> GOD, in the PROMISES, which the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD, has made unto the Godly. The Lord gave that order of old; <HI>Comfort ye, comfort ye my People, saith your God; Speak ye comfortably to them!</HI> Ah, Lord, Thou hast thy self in thy Word, most graciously, and marvellously done so! The <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD &amp; of Grace, is made up of Consolations. The Words of GOD in this <HI>Covenant,</HI> are those whereof we may say, as in Zech. I. 13. <HI>They are good Words, and comfortable Words.</HI> It is in the Sacred Scriptures, that we have this <HI>comfortable Covenant;</HI> and we are in∣formed, Rom. XV. 4. Of, <HI>The comfort of the Scriptures.</HI> There are <HI>Very Great and Precious Promises</HI> in the Word of GOD. The <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> gives a Man, a claim to these <HI>Promises; Promises</HI> both for the <HI>Life that now is,</HI> and for the <HI>Life that is to come.</HI> These <HI>Promises</HI> are so many <HI>Breasts of Consolation.</HI> Can it be any other than a Con∣solation, to understand, That we have an Alsufficient CHRIST, for our Healer, and Helper and Refuge? This Consolation <HI>of</HI> GOD is given unto them that have the <HI>Fear of</HI> GOD. We read, Mal. IV. 2. <HI>Unto you that fear my Name shall the Sun of Righteousness arise with Healing in His Wings.</HI> What a Consolation must it be to un∣derstand, That the ANGELS of Heaven, shall alwayes be Watching and Working for our Good? The Fear of God will Entitle us to this Consolation of GOD. We read; Psal. XXXIV. 7. <HI>The An∣gel of the Lord Encampeth round about them that fear Him, to deliver them.</HI> Is it not a Consolation, to understand, That we shall want no Good Thing? They that Fear God have this Consolation of GOD. We read; Psal. XXXIV. 9, 10. <HI>O Fear the Lord, Ye His Saints, for there is no want to them that fear Him. — They that Seek the Lord, shall not want any Good Thing.</HI> — But, what shall we say? The <HI>Promises</HI> of GOD, are Big with all the Consolations Imagi∣nable; with Consolations beyond all Imagination. They that are the <HI>Heirs of the Promises,</HI> Verily, they are the <HI>Heirs of Consolations.</HI> Take the <HI>Sum</HI> of the Consolations; the <HI>Sum</HI> of all Consolations; Psal. LXXXIV. 11. <HI>The Lord God is a Sun and a Shield; the Lord will give Grace &amp; Glory; no Good thing will He withold from them that walk uprightly.</HI> O COVENANT of GOD! What an Inexhausti∣ble Mine of Consolations art thou!</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001467_0008_0FB34AC42EA2E378"/>Secondly. There are <HI>Consolations of</HI> GOD, in the PLEASURES of PIETY; the <HI>Comforts</HI> which naturally result from a <HI>Pious Life.</HI> We read concerning the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of <HI>Piety,</HI> Prov. III. 17. <HI>Her wayes are wayes of Pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.</HI> It is most certain; The wayes of <HI>Piety,</HI> are ways of <HI>Pleasancy.</HI> Ah, my Young People; when you have thought, that the ways of <HI>Religion,</HI> were Severe, Austere, Morose, and <HI>Melancholy</HI> wayes; That you must never See a <HI>cheerful Minute</HI> more, after you become <HI>Seriously Religious;</HI> It was a <HI>Lying Devil</HI> which told you so: <HI>Believe him not;</HI> His lyes are full of <HI>Abominations.</HI> True PIETY, I tell you truly, tis attended with the most Enviable <HI>Consolations!</HI> We read; Psal. CXXXVIII. 5. <HI>They shall Sing in the wayes of the Lord.</HI> If we might envy the Consolations of any man Living, it should be the man who <HI>Exercises himself to keep a Conscience void of offence to∣wards God, and towards Man.</HI> There is a <HI>Continual Feast</HI> in such a <HI>Conscience.</HI> No wicked man ever knows any Delights comparable to those, wherein that man is continually bathing himself, who daily <HI>Delights himself in God. Innocency</HI> is accompanied with <HI>Sere∣nity.</HI> Sirs, would you arrive to matchless <HI>Consolations?</HI> Hate all Sin; Shun all Sin; Mourn for it, when overtaken with it; Con∣verse with GOD; Be full of Zeal to improve in the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of God, and the <HI>Image</HI> of God; and be alwayes <HI>at Work</HI> for God. Be fill'd with Benevolence, and Beneficence towards MEN: Have compassion on all the Afflicted; Scatter your <HI>Alms</HI> like the Showres of Heaven; Be Serviceable to every one on all occasions; with unspeakable Raptures of Goodness, watch for all occasions. This <HI>Walk with God,</HI> will be a <HI>Pleasant Walk;</HI> No <HI>Eden</HI> has any that e∣quals it. There is a certain <HI>Symphony</HI> and <HI>Harmony</HI> with <HI>Heaven</HI> in such a <HI>Walk.</HI> The Consolations of it, are <HI>Wonderful! Wonder∣ful!</HI> They that keep close to the ways of God, are <HI>Children of Light.</HI> There is a <HI>Light of God</HI> shining upon their ways, and into their Minds. No words can paint out the <HI>Consolations</HI> of this <HI>Light!</HI> Blind Sinner, I cannot make thee apprehend this <HI>Light.</HI> Oh! That thou wouldest <HI>Come and See!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="001467_0009_0FB34AC674876340"/>Thirdly. There are <HI>Consolations of</HI> GOD, in the ASSURAN∣CES, with which the <HI>Sealed Souls</HI> of Believers are sometimes <HI>Com∣forted of God.</HI> I know, this will be derided as <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> with the Sons of <HI>Profaneness▪</HI> But it is very sure; The SPIRIT of GOD is the COMFORTER of them who belong unto Him. There is upon the Hearts of the Faithful a Work of that Holy Spirit, which is called, <HI>A Sealing Work.</HI> Of that work we read; Eph. IV. 30. <HI>Grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are Sealed unto the Day of Redemption.</HI> Oh! the Refined <HI>Consolations</HI> of a Soul <HI>Sealed</HI> by the Holy Spirit of God! The Spirit of God first imprints upon the Mind of a Christian, the infallible <HI>Marks,</HI> of <HI>Regeneration,</HI> and <HI>Re∣conciliation,</HI> and of an Heirship to a <HI>Crown of Life.</HI> He then gives the Believer a <HI>Sight</HI> of these <HI>Marks;</HI> and fills him with the Conso∣lations which belong to a <HI>Regenerate</HI> and <HI>Reconciled</HI> State; fills him with <HI>Joy unspeakable and full of Glory.</HI> No Tongue is able to utter the <HI>Consolations</HI> of a Mind, whom the Holy Spirit of GOD <HI>Irradiates</HI> with a Perswasion and Assurance, of an Interest in the Special Fa∣vour of God. The Holy SPIRIT of God, often assures the Peni∣tent Sinner of His Mercy to him; and sayes, as in Math. IX. 2. <HI>Child, Be of Good cheer, thy Sins be forgiven thee.</HI> Oh! the Conso∣lations of a <HI>Pardoned Penitent!</HI> The <HI>Electing,</HI> the <HI>Redeeming,</HI> the <HI>Pardoning Love</HI> of God, is often Powerfully brought home, unto those who are Watchful, Fruitful, <HI>Holy in all manner of Conversation.</HI> The Holy SPIRIT, with a Powerful Satisfaction tells him, <HI>Thou art a Child of God! God has loved thee with an Everlasting love; and as a Token of it, He has enkindled in thy Heart a vehement Flame of Love to Him.</HI> He tells him; <HI>Thou hast made choice of God for thy Portion; But God first chose thee for One of His People.</HI> He tells him; <HI>Thou hast given thy self unto thy Redeemer; But God the Father first gave thee unto Him.</HI> He tells him; <HI>Thy Sins are all become lothesome to thee; The Death of thy Sins, is to thy Soul, a Blessing bet∣ter than Life it self. Tis a Token from God, that thy Sins are all For∣given thee.</HI> Can any <HI>Consolations</HI> be equal unto these? Methinks, one so Comforted of God, cannot but fall into <HI>Extasies!</HI> The <HI>Con∣solations of God,</HI> will make him to sing; Isa. XII. 1. <HI>O Lord, I will
<PB N="7" REF="001467_0010_0FB34ACA979D1AE0"/>
Praise thee; Tho' thou wast Angry with me, thine Anger is turned a∣way, and thou dost comfort me.</HI> One over-powered, and even over∣whelmed with such <HI>Consolations,</HI> must be dissolved into Tears of Joy, and cry out, <Q>Oh! What will my Glorious Father Please to do with me! Lord, I am Thine! Lord, Thou art Mine! My Father will never leave off to do me Good: He will guide me by Counsil, and bring me to Glory. Oh! my Father, and my Saviour; what shall I render to thee?</Q></P>
<P>There is one Remark to be made on the <HI>Special Season</HI> in which there uses to be a Grant of such Consolations. The Sovereign Lord of all, dispenses the Consolations when He Pleases. But yet; Are we Raised unto some <HI>Exercise of Grace,</HI> in an uncommon Ele∣vation? A <HI>Victory</HI> over Hideous <HI>Temptations?</HI> A <HI>Forgiveness</HI> unto cruel <HI>Enemies?</HI> A <HI>Resignation</HI> to the will of God in <HI>Grievous Events?</HI> Are we <HI>Patient</HI> under heavy <HI>Trials?</HI> Are we <HI>Pleased</HI> with <HI>Sufferings</HI> for the Cause, the Word, the Day of God? Are we Glad, Glad of any <HI>Conformity</HI> to our <HI>Saviour,</HI> tho' in the most Abasing Circum∣stances? NOW is a <HI>Special Season;</HI> for the SPIRIT of the Holy One, to come in upon His Faithful Servants, with more than ordi∣nary Consolations. Now, <HI>Rejoyce &amp; be Exceeding Glad,</HI> sayes our Saviour. This has been in all Ages, the Experience of the Faithful; 2 Cor. I. 5. <HI>As the Sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our Consolation also aboundeth by Christ.</HI> Hence, <HI>The Consolations of the Martyrs,</HI> these are become a <HI>Proverb in Israel!</HI></P>
<P>Is it possible to ascend any Higher, in the Consolations of GOD? Yes; From an <HI>Earnest</HI> and <HI>Foretaste</HI> of Heaven, we may ascend in∣to <HI>Heaven</HI> it self. Wherefore,</P>
<P>Fourthly, and Lastly; There are <HI>Consolations of</HI> GOD, most Blessed Consolations, reserved for us in the Heavenly BLESSED∣NESS. HEAVEN, tis Consolation in the Consummation of it. The Departed <HI>Spirit</HI> of a Good Man, is transported into the <HI>Para∣dise</HI> of GOD. When he is in that Paradise, we read; Luk. 16.25. <HI>He is Comforted.</HI> Ere long the Dead <HI>Children of God,</HI> arrive to a <HI>Resurrection</HI> from the Dead. The <HI>Resurrection</HI> was, in the ancient Language of the Orient, called, <HI>The Consolation.</HI> In the Resurrecti∣on
<PB N="8" REF="001467_0011_0FB34ACBAA2CF388"/>
we are furnished with Consolations; we are advised; 1. Thes. IV. 18. <HI>Comfort one another with these Words.</HI> But, Oh! what Consolations of God shall we receive, when we Enter into the <HI>Holy City,</HI> the <HI>Heaven of Heavens!</HI> In that City, there is <HI>Fulness of Joy.</HI> The <HI>Joy</HI> of a full <HI>Harvest,</HI> of all our Tears, all our Devotions, all our Bounties, and all our Troubles! The Consolations of having a <HI>Sight</HI> of GOD in His CHRIST, and of being <HI>made like unto Him!</HI> The Consolations of a <HI>Society,</HI> with the <HI>Innumerable Company of Ho∣ly Angels,</HI> and the <HI>Spirits of Just men made Perfect!</HI> The Consola∣tions of that CITY! I remember what we read, 1. Cor. II. 9. <HI>It hath not Gone up, [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] in the Heart of man to conceive.</HI> The word is Emphatical; to intimate, that they who have the most <HI>Lofty Conceptions,</HI> the most <HI>Raised Affections,</HI> yet cannot comprehend in their Thoughts, their Wishes, their Desires, the Consolations which <HI>God has prepared for them that Love Him!</HI></P>
<P>There are provided such Consolations to Encourage us in the Service of God.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> The Consolations of the Great GOD, Really are <HI>no Small Consolations.</HI> No; as we read; Psal. XXXI. 19. <HI>O how Great is thy Goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee!</HI> So we may say; <HI>O how Great</HI> are the Consolations, which the Great Good∣ness of God has laid up, to Invite and Reward our <HI>Fear</HI> of His Name! They must be <HI>Great Consolations,</HI> that such a <HI>Great</HI> GOD, has to bestow upon those whom He will have to be <HI>Comforted. None teaches like Him;</HI> and none <HI>Comforts</HI> like Him! Indeed, the Put∣ting of the Name of GOD upon them, (as upon <HI>Men,</HI> upon <HI>Trees,</HI> upon <HI>Hills,</HI> and the like, in the Scripture often,) may do the part of an <HI>Hebraism,</HI> to signify the <HI>Greatness</HI> of them.</P>
<P>First. The <HI>Consolations of</HI> GOD are GREAT for the NUMBER of them. Truly, in the Consolations of God, we have a <HI>Remedy</HI> for every <HI>Malady.</HI> We read, Psal. XCIV. 19 <HI>In the multitude of my Thoughts within me, thy Comforts delight my Soul.</HI> Tho' we have a <HI>Multitude</HI> of <HI>Griefs,</HI> a <HI>Multitude</HI> of <HI>Cares,</HI> a <HI>Multitude</HI> of <HI>Wants;</HI> God hath suited them all, with a <HI>Multitude of Consolations;</HI> Adapted Consolations for every One of them all. There are the
<PB N="9" REF="001467_0012_0FB34ACD2399FBB0"/>
Consolations of God agreeable to all our Conditions; Consolations in Temporals, and Consolations in Spirituals; Consolations from the Dew of Heaven, and Consolations from the Fat of the Earth. I must say, as the Apostle in another case, <HI>The Time would fail me to mention them.</HI> I call to mind, how <HI>Jerom</HI> of old Essay'd the Sum of them; <HI>Paupertatem times; sed Bonos Pauperes Christus appellat. Labore terreris; Nemo Athleta sine sudoribus coronatur. De cibo cogitas; sed Fides Famem non timet. Deus ipse omnium Rector ac Dominus, cum omni Angelorum militia certamen tuum expectat; Tibi contra Diabolum dimicanti parat aeternitatis coronam.</HI> — Say, That Christ <HI>Calls the Poor happy;</HI> Say, That all our <HI>Labours</HI> will have <HI>Rewards</HI> agreeable; Say, That <HI>Faith, fears no Famine?</HI> Say, That the Angels of God are our <HI>Guardians;</HI> and that our Warfare is their pleasant Spectacle; and our <HI>Conflict</HI> will issue in a <HI>Crown of Glory.</HI> Still, The <HI>One half has not been told</HI> unto us. <Q>How Precious are thy Consolations, O God; How Great is the Sum of them, if I should count them, they are more in Number than the Sand.</Q> At last, the Consolation amounts unto that Computation; Rev. XXI. 7. <HI>He that over-cometh, shall Inherit all things.</HI></P>
<P>I will now deal with my Hearers, as <HI>Abraham</HI> was dealt withal; Gen. XV. 5. <HI>And He brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward Heaven, and tell the Stars, if thou be Able to Number them. And He said, so shall thy Seed be.</HI> [I will not stand now to Enquire, how far this Passage might contribute unto the ancient and famous Tradition which the Pagans had, of our Patriarchs being an <HI>Astro∣nomer;</HI> but,] I will say, even so; O Child of God; canst thou <HI>tell the Number of the Stars?</HI> The <HI>Stars</HI> visible to the unassisted Eye in∣deed, we may tell the <HI>Number</HI> of them; No man ever yet saw with∣out Glasses Two Thousand of them; The latest &amp; largest Globes have but Nineteen Hundred. There are many, many more, which are not commonly seen; The <HI>Number</HI> of them was never yet known to men upon Earth. It shall not be said, <HI>So shall thy Consolations be!</HI> No, but greater, still greater, much greater, is the <HI>Number</HI> of thy Consolations: <HI>Innumerable Consolations!</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. The <HI>Consolations of God</HI> are GREAT for the NATURE
<PB N="10" REF="001467_0013_0FB38C2231632870"/>
of them. <HI>Consolations,</HI> the <HI>Quality</HI> whereof is Excellent, &amp; Exqui∣site; the Excellency Invaluable, Incomprehensible. We have a Notable Term for them; Heb. VI. 18. <HI>Strong Consolations.</HI> The Consolations of the Faithful, they have sometimes been such, that they have been too <HI>Strong</HI> for them; they have not been able to bear them; they have been forced to cry out; <HI>Lord, stay thy Hand; thy frail Servant can bear no more.</HI> Yea, the Consolations of the Faithful, what are they less than <HI>Infinite?</HI> It is the Infinite GOD Himself, in whom they have their Consolations. They are <HI>Conso∣lations of GOD,</HI> and they are Consolations IN God. The Infinite GOD, said unto the Father of the Faithful; Gen. XV. 1. <HI>I am thy Exceeding Great Reward.</HI> The same GOD, the same Infinite and Almighty GOD, sayes unto all the Faithful; <HI>I am thy Exceeding Great Comfort.</HI> Great, <HI>Great must it indeed be, if</HI> THOU, <HI>O Lord, art It!</HI> The Great GOD Himself, is the <HI>Joy</HI> of His People; How can it be any other than a very <HI>Great</HI> JOY; we read, Psal. XLIII. 4. <HI>I will go unto</HI> GOD, <HI>my Exceeding Joy.</HI> The Consolations of the Faithful, are of no lower a strain than this; <Q>The Great GOD is my God, and He will surely do me Good: He will never leave me nor forsake me. The Power of God will ever supply my wants; the Wisdom of God will ever Direct my ways; the Good∣ness of God will open the Treasures of Mercy for me. God the Father is my Father; God the Son is my Saviour; God the Spi∣rit is my Leader.</Q> O Peerless <HI>Consolations!</HI> Boundless <HI>Consola∣tions!</HI> Immortal Soul, what canst thou in thy most Extended and Insatiable Appetites, desire beyond these Consolations!</P>
<P>I now wonder no longer, at the words of that Renowned (and then Retired) States-man, Count <HI>Oxistern,</HI> to the Excellent Lord <HI>Whitlock. I do assure you I have found more comfort in my Retreat, than in all my Greatness. I recommend unto you, the Holy Scripture without you, and the Holy Spirit within you; which will be sure to En∣tertain you with the most Solid Consolations, and bring you an Everlast∣ing Felicity.</HI> I wonder not at the words of that Illustrious Empe∣rour, <HI>Charles</HI> V. after his Abdication of the Empire; <HI>True Piety has those admirable Consolations, which the Courts of Princes are Strangers to!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="001467_0014_0FB34ACEA6A708E8"/>Thirdly. The <HI>Consolations of God</HI> are GREAT for the DURATI∣ON of them. <HI>Eternal Consolations,</HI> and, <HI>Pleasures for evermore.</HI> The Consolations profered by <HI>Satan</HI> to us, as they can be all shown in a <HI>Moment of Time,</HI> they were so to our Saviour; so they will hold but a <HI>Moment of Time.</HI> O <HI>Sin,</HI> what are thy Consolations? They are <HI>Pleasures but for a Season;</HI> and a very, very short Season too. They are but as the <HI>Crackling of Thorns under a Pot;</HI> A <HI>short</HI> Noise, a <HI>short</HI> Blaze, and they are Gone. But now, the <HI>Consolations of God,</HI> these are <HI>Durable Riches.</HI> We read, 2 Thes. II. 16. <HI>God hath given us Everlasting Consolation.</HI> The Consolations of God, they will <HI>Stay</HI> with us; They are a <HI>Joy that none can take from us;</HI> They are an <HI>Eternal Glory.</HI> The <HI>Heavens</HI> as well as the <HI>Earth,</HI> shall <HI>Perish;</HI> But, O <HI>Heavenly Consolations;</HI> You shall <HI>Endure.</HI> They shall <HI>wax old like a Garment, and they shall be changed;</HI> But you are <HI>the same,</HI> and your <HI>Years will have no End! Endless Consolations;</HI> and there∣fore no <HI>Little Consolations!</HI></P>
<P N="3"><HI>III</HI> Every one will now grant me a Third Assertion. <HI>The Great Consolations of</HI> GOD, if they are SMALL with us, <HI>Great</HI> is our Ig∣norance, <HI>Great</HI> is our Corruption; we are <HI>Greatly to be blamed for it.</HI> It cannot but be a <HI>Great</HI> Error, a <HI>Great</HI> Evil, in men, to set but a <HI>Lit∣tle Esteem,</HI> on the <HI>Great Consolations</HI> of GOD.</P>
<P>This is now so plain, it calls for no further Demonstration. Per∣haps it will do well to Enquire, <HI>When may it be said of a Man, That the Consolations of God are Small unto him?</HI> The Enquiry, shall be answered at once. The <HI>Consolations of God, are Small</HI> with a Man, when the man who has <HI>no Title</HI> to them, can do well Enough without it, or does not think it worth his while to Look after it. And, The <HI>Consolations of God are Small</HI> with a man, when a man, who has a <HI>Title</HI> to them, is not Contented with it, or thinks it not Enough to yield Contentment unto him.</P>
<P>I am now fairly arrived unto the <HI>Expostulation,</HI> in which these Assertions are to terminate.</P>
<P>But how many, how many, are to be now address'd with a most Pungent <HI>Expostulation!</HI> Certainly, There are very many among us, of whom it may be fear'd, <HI>The Consolations of God are Small unto
<PB N="12" REF="001467_0015_0FB34AD0210C5B90"/>
them. Their Transgression sayes within my Heart,</HI> that the <HI>Consolations of God</HI> are but Little in their Eyes. To be more particular.</P>
<P>First. How SMALL are the <HI>Consolations of God,</HI> with such as are the Despisers of a Glorious CHRIST, who is, <HI>The Consolation of Isra∣el!</HI> The Name of the <HI>Messiah</HI> of old, was, <HI>The Consolation.</HI> Be∣cause the <HI>Messiah</HI> did not yet appear to Save His People; there were those <HI>Lamentations;</HI> Lam. I. 16. <HI>Mine Eye runs down with Tears, be∣cause the Comforter that should Relieve my Soul, is far from me.</HI> The Jewish <HI>Rabbi's,</HI> putting that Question, <HI>What shall be the Name of the Messiah?</HI> do cite this very Text, for to prove, that His Name shall be, <HI>Menachem,</HI> or, <HI>The Comforter.</HI> But are there no <HI>Christless</HI> ones, of whom it may be said; <HI>The Comforter that should Relieve their Souls, is far from them;</HI> The Saviour, &amp; His Great Salvation, is <HI>far from the wicked</HI> ones; They have no <HI>Acquaintance</HI> with a Glorious CHRIST, no <HI>Union</HI> with Him, no <HI>Fellowship</HI> with Him; And yet their <HI>Eye</HI> never dropt so much as one <HI>Tear,</HI> on this deplorable occasion! Ah, <HI>Christless</HI> Unbeliever! The Consolations of God are Small with thee. If there be any Consolations, they are such as an Interest in a Glorious CHRIST is accompanied withal. We read, Phil. II. 1. Of, <HI>Consolation in Christ.</HI> Our CHRIST, our CHRIST is the true <HI>Noah,</HI> of whom we may say, <HI>This same shall comfort us.</HI> O under-valuer of the most Glorious Comforter, If thou hast any Regard unto the <HI>Greatest</HI> of Consolations, come to the CHRIST, who calls thee to come unto Him. Come, and put thy self into His Hands; cast thy self upon His Mediation; Sit down <HI>under the shadow</HI> of the <HI>Tree of Life with Delight.</HI> It is <HI>Good Tidings of Great Joy,</HI> That we may have a Glorious CHRIST for our Saviour: What would it be, if He should say, <HI>I will be thy Saviour!</HI> If once the CHRIST of GOD become thy CHRIST, thou shalt find <HI>Wisdom,</HI> and <HI>Righteous∣ness,</HI> and <HI>Holiness,</HI> and <HI>Redemption</HI> laid up in Him for thee. Oh! The Consolations to be found in such Benefits of such a Saviour, and a Great One! How Comfortable, how Comfortable, must it be, to think; <Q>My Sin is all Pardoned thro' the Blood of Jesus Christ the Son of God, which cleanses from all Sin! I stand before God in a Righteousness better &amp; brighter, than what the brightest
<PB N="13" REF="001467_0016_0FB34AD1A1D0C0E8"/>
Angels in Heaven could have help'd me to! My JESUS is my Advocate, and Pleads continually that I may not miss of Hap∣piness! He will most certainly shew me the Path of Life; He will most certainly Save me from every Path of the Destroyer: He will most certainly bestow upon me an Eternal Mansion in His Fathers House.</Q> His Father is my Father; His God is my God. O <HI>Consolations</HI> that Surpass all <HI>Contemplations!</HI> My Friend, All these Consolations will be thine, upon thy falling down before a Glorious CHRIST, and sincerely saying; <HI>Lord, I am Thine, Save me!</HI> Consent, Comply, Be willing to be the Lords. <HI>Then</HI> thou hast all His <HI>Consolations.</HI> Why, why are the <HI>Consolations of God so Small</HI> with thee, that a Glorious CHRIST with His <HI>Consolations,</HI> it seems, are not worth <HI>Acceptance</HI> with thee? O Sinner, <HI>Foolish &amp; Unwise!</HI> Thy madness is not <HI>Small;</HI> else these <HI>Consolations of God,</HI> would not be so <HI>Small.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. How SMALL are the <HI>Consolations of God,</HI> with such as Delay their CONVERSION to God, and will not be moved by all the Consolations, which will undoubtedly follow upon <HI>Obedience</HI> to Him? Upon <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD, the Sinner comes to vast Con∣solations. We are so called upon; Act. III. 19. <HI>Repent and be Con∣verted, that so the Times of Refreshing may come.</HI> Indeed, the He∣brew word, <HI>Nacham,</HI> the Root of our word here for, <HI>Consolations;</HI> it signifies, first of all to <HI>Repent,</HI> and then to <HI>Comfort;</HI> Because to the <HI>Penitent</HI> there belongs <HI>Consolation.</HI> But then, how surprisingly must the Consolations go on, and <HI>Increase &amp; Multiply!</HI> Oh! the <HI>Blessednesses</HI> and the <HI>Consolations</HI> of the man, whose <HI>Transgression is Forgiven!</HI> The man who is become an <HI>Heir of God,</HI> and a <HI>Joint-Heir</HI> with the Son of God! The man, whom the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God, makes a <HI>Temple</HI> of God, and chuses to <HI>Dwell</HI> there for ever as a <HI>Comforter!</HI> No <HI>Boethius</HI> is Master of a Pen, that can Soar high enough, to describe the <HI>Consolations.</HI> We are told, There is <HI>Joy in Heaven,</HI> it gives a Consolation unto the Angels in Heaven, when a <HI>Sinner is brought unto Repentance.</HI> O <HI>Repenting Sinner,</HI> certainly then thy Soul, has a claim to a most <HI>Heavenly Consolation!</HI> As it was of old said, <HI>Seemeth it a light matter unto you, to be the Son in Law of a
<PB N="14" REF="001467_0017_0FB34AD323BA06D0"/>
King!</HI> I will say, O Sinner loth to turn unto God; <HI>Seemeth it a light matter</HI> unto thee, to become a <HI>Child of God!</HI> A <HI>Light matter,</HI> to be a <HI>Favourite</HI> of Heaven! A <HI>Light matter,</HI> to be a Candidate of a <HI>Crown that Fadeth not away!</HI> What? Such Consolations of God, are they so <HI>Small</HI> with thee, that the filthy and fulsome Grati∣fications of the <HI>Flesh,</HI> are to be preferred before them! Has the <HI>Devil</HI> more Desireable Things for thee, than these <HI>Consolations of God?</HI> This, This indeed is the cursed Language of thy continu∣ance in thy Sins. Oh! <HI>Talk no more</HI> so exceeding Vainly, so ex∣ceeding Vilely; and let such Blasphemy be <HI>no more uttered</HI> in thy Unconverted Procrastinations. With a Subdued Soul, <HI>from this Time,</HI> Oh! Fall down before the Lord, and say, <HI>O Great GOD, Thou shalt be my Father, and the Guide of my Life!</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly. Sinner, <HI>Despairing</HI> of Mercy &amp; Pardon, Thy DESPAIR does declare, That the <HI>Consolations of God</HI> are too SMALL with thee, to conquer it. There are Sinners who <HI>See</HI> themselves, and perhaps have cause to <HI>own</HI> themselves, <HI>The chief of Sinners.</HI> The sight of their Sins exceedingly Terrifies them. And indeed they are a very Terrible sight! But yet, Oh, <HI>Despair</HI> not. Before the Awakened Sinner, I will now set the <HI>Consolations of God.</HI> Ah, Dis∣couraged Soul, Be thy Sins never so Many, never so Heinous, there is a <HI>Pardon</HI> to be had! I bring to the most criminal among you all, that Advice from Heaven: Isa. LV. 7. <HI>Let him return unto the Lord, and He will have Mercy upon him; and unto our God, for He will a∣bundantly Pardon.</HI> I bring you that Advice; Matth. XII. 31. <HI>All manner of Sin shall be Forgiven unto men.</HI> I bring you that Advice; 1. Joh. I. 7. <HI>The Blood of</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>the Son of God, cleanses from all Sin.</HI> O Lively Consolations! O Wondrous Consolations! O Consolations of God! The <HI>Day of Grace</HI> is not yet over with you. Behold, O Sinners, willing to Confess and Bewayl and Abhor all your Sins; O Sinners, willing to have all your Sins Forgiven and your Lusts Mortified, thro' the Sacrifice of the most Holy JESUS; The Servants of God have a Commission to stand among you, and make this Proclamation; <HI>A Pardon! A Pardon!</HI> O Perishing Souls, <HI>A Pardon</HI> is Ready for you. Do but Humble your selves before
<PB N="15" REF="001467_0018_0FB34AD7A2F90890"/>
the Glorious GOD, and humbly plead the Blood of your Saviour, that God may <HI>Forgive your Sins, and cleanse you from all Unrighteous∣ness;</HI> and you shall find Him, <HI>Ready to Pardon.</HI> Let Rebels, let the most monstrous <HI>Giants</HI> in Rebellion, know, That a Sin-Pardoning Lord, even <HI>Waits to be Gracious</HI> unto them. To <HI>You,</HI> even to <HI>You,</HI> there is now made, the astonishing offer of a <HI>Pardon</HI> after all. To them that have been the Greatest Monsters of Sin, there is now Proclamed this <HI>Consolation of God!</HI> What an Heart-melting word is that? Mic. VII. 19. <HI>He will Subdue our Iniquities.</HI> Man, There stands a mighty <HI>Army</HI> of <HI>Iniquities</HI> in the way of thy Happiness. How must thy Heart fail thee, when the Holy God <HI>Sets them in Or∣der</HI> before thine Eyes! But now, Be sorry for thy <HI>Iniquities;</HI> with Remorse lay down the Arms of thy Rebellion; lay Hold on the Tenders, and Merits of thy Saviour: Then the Pardoning Mercy of God, will <HI>Subdue</HI> this mighty <HI>Army</HI> of <HI>Iniquities.</HI> None of them shall hinder His Favour to thee; They shall be <HI>Cast into the depths of the Sea;</HI> the Red-Sea of thy Saviours Blood shall drown this <HI>Ar∣my.</HI> The <HI>Number</HI> or the <HI>Blackness</HI> of thy Sins must not be thy Discouragement. There is a <HI>Fountain Set Open</HI> for the most <HI>Unclean Sinner</HI> among us all to repair unto! And upon thy <HI>Washing</HI> in that <HI>Fountain,</HI> O Sinner, All thy Sin will be, as if it had never been at all. Thy past <HI>Scarlet</HI> and <HI>Crimson</HI> Abominations will not hinder a bright Complexion of <HI>Snow</HI> and <HI>Wooll</HI> from Succeeding in thy Pu∣rified Soul. Is any of you distressed with an Apprehension of ha∣ving <HI>Sinned Unpardonably;</HI> of having fallen into the <HI>Unpardonable Sin?</HI> To that Soul, I must bring this <HI>Consolation of God;</HI> Soul, Thy Distressing <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>that,</HI> is a Proof that there is no <HI>Cause</HI> to <HI>Fear</HI> it. I will add; Art thou Desirous of a <HI>Pardon?</HI> Would a <HI>Pardon</HI> be to thee a <HI>Pearl of Great Price?</HI> Hast thou any value for the <HI>Blood</HI> of thy Saviour, which is the <HI>Price</HI> of thy <HI>Pardon?</HI> Tis very certain, Thou hast never yet fallen into the <HI>Sin that cannot be Pardoned.</HI> Oh! Let this Consolation of God mightily Quicken you, to <HI>Repent,</HI> and <HI>Believe,</HI> and make sure of the <HI>Attainable Pardon!</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. And, I Pray, What are the <HI>Consolations of God;</HI> How SMALL! unto them who are unconcerned about Preparing for,
<PB N="16" REF="001467_0019_0FB34AD9241EC3E0"/>
and Approaching to, the SPECIAL ORDINANCES, where those <HI>Consolations</HI> are to be met withal? Concerning the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of the Gospel, we read, Isa. XII. 3. <HI>With Joy shall ye Draw Water out of the Wells of Salvation.</HI> Of one who had been <HI>Baptised,</HI> we read, <HI>He went on his way Rejoycing.</HI> By Reflecting on, and Improving of our <HI>Baptism,</HI> we may come to the <HI>Still Waters,</HI> where we shall find <HI>Rivers of Consolation.</HI> Alas, what a Rarity is this in the <HI>Christian World!</HI> How do we <HI>Forget</HI> our <HI>Baptism,</HI> and <HI>Remember it as waters that pass away!</HI> We read again, that there was <HI>Great Joy in Jerusa∣lem</HI> of old, at the celebration of the <HI>Passover.</HI> Oh! the <HI>Great Joy,</HI> of the Consolation, which we might find in celebrating the <HI>Gospel-Passover</HI> at the Table of the Lord! Yet, alas, how do the <HI>Ways of Zion Mourn,</HI> because there is no more careful walking in them! In the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of our Saviour, we may look for the <HI>Consolations of God.</HI> They are the <HI>Statutes of the Lord,</HI> which <HI>Rejoyce the Heart.</HI> I shall be sorry, if none of my Hearers are able to testify so much, from what they have this very Day met withal. But more especi∣ally, in <HI>Special Ordinances.</HI> What less to be look'd for, in the <HI>House of God,</HI> at the <HI>Gate of Heaven!</HI></P>
<P>Oh! why no more Sollicitous to come with Ready Souls, unto the most <HI>Comfortable Ordinances</HI> of the Lord! Ah, Slothful Soul! Tis a Sad thing, that the Consolations of God are so <HI>Small</HI> with thee! What some have done thro' <HI>Pettishness,</HI> may be said to be done by those thro' <HI>Slothfulness;</HI> Psal. LXXVII. 2. <HI>My Soul refused to be comforted.</HI></P>
<P>Fifthly. Methinks, The <HI>Consolations of God</HI> are too SMALL unto the People of God themselves, when under their AFFLICTI∣ONS, they take not up with those <HI>Consolations,</HI> but their <HI>Souls Re∣fuse to be Comforted.</HI> There are some, who have a part in the Con∣solations of God; And yet, when they are <HI>Afflicted,</HI> when in their <HI>Afflictions</HI> they are bereaved of some <HI>Earthly Consolations,</HI> they are like her, of whom we read, Mat. II. 18. <HI>She would not be Comforted. Length of Time,</HI> alas, is the <HI>only Solace</HI> known by many Afflicted People, who would yet be Esteemed the People of God. When they are Afflicted, nothing will compose them; They will continue
<PB N="17" REF="001467_0020_0FB34ADAA1908F50"/>
to <HI>Rage,</HI> or to <HI>Pine,</HI> until — <HI>Longa Dies sedavit Vulnera mentis.</HI> But, O <HI>Disconsolate</HI> People of God, Hearken a little to me. What a vast Bundle of <HI>Consolations</HI> have you, in that One word! Rom. VIII. 28. <HI>We know, all things work together for Good, unto them that Love God.</HI> Oh! Let it not be <HI>Small</HI> with you! One thing more: You lose <HI>Earth,</HI> but you have <HI>Heaven</HI> left you. And is this a <HI>Small</HI> thing in your Eyes?</P>
<P>I will first Speak a very awful Word. It is this; If the Conso∣lations of God are so <HI>Small</HI> with you, that they will <HI>do nothing</HI> to Quiet you, When you meet with Losses and Crosses in an Evil World, it may be question'd, Whether you have a part in those <HI>Consolations.</HI> I will add this; You will anon find, That <HI>nothing else will do</HI> to Quiet you; you will find a Wretched <HI>Vanity</HI> &amp; <HI>Vexation,</HI> in all other Consolations: The Consolations of <HI>This World</HI> will fail your Expectations, and be <HI>Physicians of no value.</HI></P>
<P>It was a Sweet Passage of the Poet;
<Q><L>Taedia quem mundi teneant, reperire Quietem</L>
<L>Si velit, in Solo Numine quaerat eam.</L></Q></P>
<P>I must English it.</P>
<Q><L>Soul, whom the Worlds Fatigues do make to groan,</L>
<L>Seek all thy Comfort in thy GOD alone.</L></Q>
<P>You shall allow me to Propose one thing more, in Pursuance of the Design I am going upon. It was an Excellent Proposal made in the Church of God Eleven Hundred years ago; <HI>Facilius erit Con∣solatio, si inter Flagella quae Patimur, quae fecimus ad memoriam De∣licta revocamus.</HI> Let us in all our <HI>Afflictions,</HI> be Mindful of our <HI>Miscarriages,</HI> be Mournful for our <HI>Iniquities;</HI> Humbly Adore the <HI>Justice</HI> of God in all our <HI>Afflictive Cases:</HI> We are by such <HI>Humilia∣tions</HI> prepared for the <HI>Consolations of God.</HI> Now we may go on.</P>
<P>I will now make the Experiment, what the <HI>Consolations of God</HI> will Signify, in Two or three Cases, that are of a frequent Occur∣rence among us. The Ancient has taught me, <HI>Dolentem non Potest Consolari, qui non concordat Dolori.</HI></P>
<P>First. There are Some who are grievously annoyed, fearfully disturbed, with the FIERY DARTS which the <HI>Wicked One</HI> Shoots
<PB N="18" REF="001467_0021_0FB34ADC2608C930"/>
into their Minds. They cry out of the <HI>Injections,</HI> wherewith Satan troubles them; and affrights them: Suggestions full of <HI>Atheism,</HI> full of <HI>Blasphemy,</HI> full of <HI>Hellish</HI> Malignity, are injected by Satan into their Souls. The vexation is insupportable; it renders them even weary of their Lives. <HI>Hideous Thoughts</HI> are thrown into them, and such as make them afraid the dreadful Wrath of God must overtake them Immediately, Irremediably. A very <HI>Pityable</HI> case! But can there be any <HI>Consolations of God</HI> for One so horribly Tempted of the Devil? Yes; And very <HI>Great</HI> Ones. There is that Consolation; 1 Cor. X. 13. <HI>There has no Temptation taken you, but such as is Common to Man;</HI> Yea, Common to Good Men. Tis rather a Good, than a Bad, Sign to be thus Buffeted by the Devil. O Soul <HI>Mourning because of the Oppression of the Enemy;</HI> If the Devil did not Look upon thee, as upon one who made Conscience of <HI>Sin∣ning</HI> in thy <HI>Thoughts,</HI> it is probable, he would not chuse to persecute thee with such <HI>Sinful Thoughts.</HI> Take this Consolation also; Go on to <HI>Bewayl</HI> these <HI>Thoughts,</HI> to <HI>Abhor</HI> these <HI>Thoughts,</HI> to <HI>Renounce</HI> these <HI>Thoughts,</HI> and God will never lay them to thy Charge; No, they shall be charged upon thy <HI>Adversary,</HI> who <HI>Provokes thee sore;</HI> tis he that is the <HI>Father</HI> of them. And, then take likewise this Consolation. By an unwearied Contradiction of these <HI>Thoughts,</HI> or making these Thoughts an Incentive as often as they recur, to raise <HI>Thoughts</HI> that shall be directly contradictory to them, and fill'd with devout Acknowledgments of God and His Christ; this will soon weary out thy Adversary; Tis but <HI>Resisting the Devil</HI> thus a little while, and <HI>he will flee</HI> from thee!</P>
<P>Secondly. Are there any STRAITS upon us? Perhaps, we are Straitned with <HI>Poor</HI> and <HI>Low</HI> Circumstances; The Times grow hard; we are afraid we shall be hardly or but meanly provided for.</P>
<P>In this case, there are some <HI>Great Consolations of God</HI> which I can Lead you to. There is that Consolation; Jam. II 5. <HI>Hath not God chosen the Poor of this World, Rich in Faith, and Heirs of the King∣dom?</HI> There is that Consolation; Psal. XXXVII. 3. <HI>Trust in the Lord, and do Good, and verily thou shalt be fed.</HI> My Friend, Hast thou not a CHRIST? In Him thou hast <HI>Unsearchable Riches.</HI> In
<PB N="19" REF="001467_0022_0FB38C237841B3F0"/>
Him will thy God <HI>Supply all thy Wants from His Glorious Riches.</HI> And if HE be thine, He will help thee, to all that can be Needful for thee. Thou hast a <HI>Father</HI> and a <HI>Feeder,</HI> that <HI>Knows all that thou Needest.</HI> I must say, <HI>Have ye forgotten the Consolation, that that Speaks to you, as unto Children?</HI></P>
<P>If any of you meet with <HI>Impoverishing Disasters,</HI> what will you say to that Word? 2 Chron. XXV. 9 <HI>The Lord is able to give thee much more than this.</HI> Truly, Sir, If God gives you more <HI>Grace,</HI> than you had before; If you are made more <HI>Prayerful,</HI> more <HI>Watchful,</HI> more <HI>Weaned</HI> from this World; Or, if God have given you the <HI>Grace</HI> to bear your Impoverishments with <HI>Resignation;</HI> He has <HI>given you much more</HI> than all that has been taken from you. Is there <HI>nothing</HI> in these <HI>Consolations?</HI></P>
<P>Lastly. Have we our Desirable RELATIVES taken from us? But in this case also, we have at hand, the <HI>Great Consolations of God.</HI></P>
<P>Are the <HI>Relatives</HI> at a <HI>Distance</HI> from us in other Countries? Be Comforted; <HI>God Knows</HI> where they are. His Kind <HI>Eye</HI> is upon them there; His Kind <HI>Hand</HI> can reach them. If they are in <HI>Cap∣tivity,</HI> yet, Jer. XXXI. 16. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, Refrain thy Voice from Weeping, and thine Eyes from Tears; for thy Work shall be Re∣warded, and they shall come again from the Land of the Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>Has DEATH taken away the <HI>Relatives?</HI> Be Comforted; <HI>God Lives.</HI> And if a CHRIST be yours, you have the <HI>Good Part that can't be taken away.</HI> Should not that <HI>Widow</HI> be Comforted, who can say, <HI>My Maker is my Husband?</HI> Or, that <HI>Widower;</HI> who can say, <HI>God has Meant all unto Good?</HI></P>
<P>But the PARENTS who have buried their <HI>Children,</HI> have they no <HI>Consolations of God?</HI> We read of such a thing as that, at the <HI>Funerals</HI> of old; Jer. XVI. 7. <HI>The Cup of Consolations.</HI> Tis there provided for the Funerals of <HI>Parents. Parents</HI> also have it provided for the Funerals of their <HI>Children. Parents,</HI> I have one of Gods providing for you. O <HI>Drink of the wine, which I have mingled for you,</HI> saith the Lord. The <HI>Consolations of Men,</HI> such as <HI>Horace</HI> offers to his Friend <HI>Valgius</HI> on the Death of his dear <HI>Mysta;</HI> and such as you have in the Writings of <HI>Seneca,</HI> and the other <HI>Stoick</HI> Philoso∣phers,
<PB N="20" REF="001467_0023_0FB34ADDA0184348"/>
or the rest, are very Small Ones: very mean truly. Yea, They Themselves upon great occasions do confess them so. Such was that famous One, in <HI>Stobaeus,</HI> to one who had Buried his Child; <HI>Before that Child came into the World, thou hadst no Grief about it. Why shouldest thou grieve, now tis gone out of the World?</HI> Have we no Higher Notes? Yes; If the <HI>Parents</HI> are themselves the <HI>Chil∣dren of God,</HI> then they have a <HI>Name far better than that of Sons and of Daughters.</HI> If the <HI>Son of God</HI> be theirs, then they have One, who should be <HI>Better to them than Ten Sons or Daughters.</HI></P>
<P>It may be, the Children had <HI>Comfortable Symptoms</HI> upon them, in their Sober, Modest, Vertuous Behaviour. To hope, that it is well with them, is an unspeakable <HI>Consolation.</HI> Then, as it was said unto the Ruler, on the Death of his Daughter; <HI>She is not Dead, but Sleepeth.</HI> Even the Pagan could give it as a Direction; <HI>Be not Sorrowful for the Dead; since there is a Necessity of dying; But spend thy Sorrow, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, upon such as Dy wretchedly, and wofully.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Luther,</HI> when his Daughter <HI>Magdalene</HI> was Expiring, he read unto her, from the XXVI. Chapter of <HI>Isaiah;</HI> and concluded thus; <HI>My Daughter, Enter thou into thy Chamber, with Peace, I shall ere long be with thee.</HI> On this, he wept Plentifully; but in Publick attend∣ed the Horse without a Tear.</P>
<P>Diverse of the old Poets observed, That if <HI>Tears</HI> would <HI>fetch back the Dead, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. We would gladly change Gold for Tears; Tears would be better than Gold.</HI> But since <HI>Tears</HI> are of so little use, we need go no further, in filling our <HI>Lacrymato∣ries,</HI> for our <HI>Dead Children.</HI> We are in the midst of the <HI>Consolations</HI> which may be most Reasonable <HI>Spunges</HI> to the <HI>Eyes</HI> that are a <HI>Foun∣tain of Tears. Grotius</HI> did well to deride it as a foolish saying of <HI>Solon, I weep the more, because I can do no Good by Weeping.</HI></P>
<P>It may be, they were <HI>Children</HI> who have left <HI>Children,</HI> and have Enlarged the <HI>Kingdom of Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>It may be, what is buried in <HI>One Child,</HI> may be richly made up in <HI>Another;</HI> in the more than <HI>Doubled Comfort</HI> from the hopeful Character and Carriage of <HI>Another.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="001467_0024_0FB34ADF9413CD10"/>And, what a <HI>World,</HI> what a Troublesome, what a Dangerous what an <HI>Horrible World,</HI> are your <HI>Children</HI> taken from? O Saint of God, I know, thou saist, <HI>This is none of my World?</HI> The Great <HI>Baxter,</HI> in a Noble Treatise, <HI>Of Obedient Patience in particular Cases,</HI> has a Passage, which I cannot help taking some Notice of. Sayes he; <HI>When I see, what a miserable World it is, that we are in, even like the Suburbs of Hell, I have never grieved, that I never had a Child; And why then should I mourn, if I had One, and God had quickly taken him away!</HI></P>
<P>After all; If God will not have <HI>your House</HI> to grow, yet you have a <HI>Standing in His House.</HI> You have also a Title to a <HI>Cove∣nant</HI> full of <HI>Sure Mercies;</HI> a <HI>Covenant Ordered for all things &amp; Sure;</HI> a <HI>Covenant</HI> whereof you joyfully say, <HI>This is all my Salvation and all my Desire.</HI></P>
<P>And truly, Sir, if GOD call you to <HI>Sacrifices,</HI> even to <HI>Successive Sacrifices;</HI> to Sacrifice One <HI>Lamb</HI> after another: Now, to go on after an Holy manner with them, it is an Evidence of your Share in an <HI>Holy Priesthood.</HI> It is an Argument and an Evidence, that after you have pass'd thro' all your <HI>Tribulation,</HI> you shall appear in your <HI>Wash'd Robes</HI> among the <HI>Priests of God,</HI> and receive the Accomplishment of that Word; Rev. VII. 15, 17. <HI>They are before the Throne of God, and Serve Him day and night in His Temple, and God shall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>I Leave with you these <HI>Consolations of God;</HI> I beseech you to take them; to Feed and Live upon them.</P>
<P>My <HI>NEHEMIAH,</HI> [for since you know that Name Signi∣fies, <HI>The Consolation of the Lord,</HI> you will give my Sermon leave to Wear that Name:] has not yet, as I find upon a Review, dispensed all the <HI>Consolations</HI> that yet may be comprised within the Limits of my Designed Brevity.</P>
<P>There is a SPECTACLE, that is Extremely uneasy to us; a very Mournful and Frightful Spectacle! The <HI>Spectacle</HI> of, <HI>A whole World Lying in Wickedness;</HI> and by the just wrath of GOD rendred therefore an Entire <HI>Aceldama; Wickedness</HI> raging and
<PB N="22" REF="001467_0025_0FB34AE243A931E0"/>
reigning at a Strange rate; The <HI>Sons of Wickedness</HI> carrying all before them; Good Men Oppressed; and the more Good they do, the more Exposed unto Oppression; unto the <HI>Contradiction of Sin∣ners,</HI> and all the Persecution which the <HI>Tongue,</HI> or <HI>Pen,</HI> or <HI>Fist</HI> of Wickedness, can assault them withal; The VIALS of the Divine Indignation, Pouring out, under a THIRD WO begun upon a <HI>Wicked</HI> and <HI>Woful</HI> World; The <HI>Curse</HI> devouring the Earth, with Numberless and Horrible <HI>Desolations.</HI></P>
<P>But have we any <HI>Consolations</HI> under so grievous a <HI>Spectacle?</HI> Yes, and very <HI>Great</HI> Ones too. Very particularly <HI>That;</HI> 2 Pet. III. 13. <HI>According to His Promise, we Look for New Heavens and a New Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteousness.</HI> In the mean time, <HI>That;</HI> 2 Pet. II. 9. <HI>The Lord knows how to deliver the Godly out of Tempta∣tions.</HI> Briefly, Another and a better State of the World, is coming on. It was a Remarkable Passage, which lately fell from the very Learned, and Holy, and Famous Dr. <HI>Spener:</HI> That brave Man, when he lay a dying, Ordered that when he was Dead, there should not be so much as one Threed of <HI>Black</HI> used about his Coffin; for, said he, <Q>I have been a Sorrowful Mourner for the Afflictions and Corruptions of the Church Militant all my days; but I am now Entring into the Joy of the Church Triumphant; and therefore I will not now have the Least Mark of Sorrow upon me. And Let this Desire of Mine, be a Token to you, of my Faith, O my Friends, that our Great Saviour has Glorious Things to do short∣ly for His Church upon that Earth, where I leave my Ashes a∣mong you.</Q></P>
<P>I will bestow a Little Illustration upon this Matter, and so Conclude it.</P>
<P>There was a very Surprising Tradition among the ancient Pa∣gans, recited by <HI>Plutarch,</HI> in his Treatise of <HI>Isis,</HI> and <HI>Osiris.</HI> About the <HI>Origin of Evil,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, there was much Enquiry among the Ancients. They conceived, that there were <HI>Two Gods;</HI> One the Original of <HI>Good;</HI> the other, of <HI>Evil.</HI> According to <HI>Zoroaster,</HI> the Name of the former was <HI>Oromazes,</HI> the Name of the latter, <HI>Arimanius. Oromazes</HI> was resembled unto <HI>Light, Arimanius</HI> unto
<PB N="23" REF="001467_0026_0FB34AE4640469C8"/>
<HI>Darkness.</HI> There is a War between <HI>Oromazes,</HI> and <HI>Arimanius Oromazes</HI> Lodg'd the World in an <HI>Egg;</HI> but <HI>Arimanius</HI> Perforated it. Hence there is every where a Perpetual Mixture of <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil,</HI> And from the <HI>Enmity</HI> between them, what Works are <HI>done</HI> by One, are <HI>Spoilt</HI> by the other. But a <HI>Time Decreed by Fate</HI> will come, when <HI>Arimanius</HI> must be totally destroy'd by <HI>Oromazes,</HI> Then the <HI>Earth</HI> being brought into an admirably Smooth Conditi∣on, men shall all be Universally Blessed, and Inhabit as it were <HI>One City,</HI> and have One way of <HI>Living,</HI> and Speak <HI>One Language;</HI> and enjoy a Wonderful Happiness <HI>Plutarch</HI> says, This was <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, A very <HI>Ancient Opinion,</HI> and that it had obtained a <HI>Firm and Indelible Belief.</HI> Now, this Marvellous Tradition, contains in it, no con∣temptible Reliques of Glorious Truth; GOD, the Maker of the World; whose Name is <HI>Light;</HI> And, <HI>Satan,</HI> the Fountain of Evil; whose Name is, <HI>The Prince of Darkness.</HI> It is indeed a Broken Re∣membrance of our <HI>Protevangeleum,</HI> in the <HI>Third Chapter of Genesis.</HI></P>
<P>And what I go on to Remark, is, That altho' the Sacred Ora∣cles, every where Conspire to advise us, of a Day at hand, in which the <HI>Creation</HI> shall be Delivered from the <HI>Vanity</HI> which it is now <HI>Groaning</HI> under, and an <HI>Holy</HI> and <HI>Righteous</HI> and <HI>Peaceable</HI> Kingdom of God, shall take Place in the World, yet they are all but Com∣mentaries upon that <HI>Protevangelium;</HI> we have in <HI>That,</HI> the <HI>Origi∣nal Text,</HI> as I may call it, and a <HI>Sure Foundation</HI> for our Hopes, <HI>That the World will not always be so bad as now it is. Maresius,</HI> having written a Disputation full of Bitter Zeal against the <HI>Chiliasts;</HI> the incomparable <HI>Comenius,</HI> when he was about Fourscore years of Age, wrote a Treatise on that occasion, with all the Learning, and Vigour and Style, which could have been Expected from a <HI>Literator,</HI> in the very Meridian of all his Glory. The <HI>Begin∣ning</HI> of his Treatise runs upon this Argument. The Birth of <HI>Chi∣liasm</HI> was in <HI>Paradise.</HI> It was born to us in the <HI>Protevangelium</HI> given there. There we find foretold, a Perpetual <HI>War</HI> between the <HI>Serpent</HI> and our <HI>Saviour.</HI> There is foretold, the final <HI>Issue</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="001467_0027_0FB34AE526E12FA0"/>
of the War, in the Destruction of the <HI>Serpent,</HI> and an Illustrious and Everlasting Victory of our <HI>Saviour.</HI> Well; But where is the <HI>Field</HI> of these Transactions? This is Evidently the EARTH. All the World Knows and Feels, that this our <HI>Earth,</HI> is the <HI>Field</HI> of the <HI>War.</HI> We desire then to Know, Whether after all, the Conqueror must <HI>Leave the Field</HI> unto his vanquished Enemy? Whether the Conqueror do not always <HI>Chase the Enemy out of the Field,</HI> and he himself keep the Possession of it. <HI>Pelli Solet Hostis in ultima usque antra Sua, Captivusque in Carcerem mitti.</HI> So then, there is a Day at hand, when <HI>Satan,</HI> with all his Power and Party must be Chased off the Face of the <HI>Earth;</HI> and the Earth be Entirely in the Possession of our Admirable Saviour. Let this be our Conclusion; This our <HI>Consolation.</HI> — But, <HI>How Long, O Lord, Holy and True; How Long, How Long!</HI></P>
