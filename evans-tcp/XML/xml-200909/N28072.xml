<L>'TWAS post meridian, half past four,</L>
<L>By signal I from Nancy parted,</L>
<L>At six she linger'd on the shore,</L>
<L>With uplift hands and broken hearted;</L>
<L>At seven while taught'ning the fore stay.</L>
<L>I saw her faint, or else it was fancy;</L>
<L>At eight we all got under way,</L>
<L>And bid a long adieu to Nancy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Night came, and now eight bells had rung,</L>
<L>While careless sailors over cheery,</L>
<L>On the mid watch so jovial sung,</L>
<L>With tempers, labour, cannot weary <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</L>

I little to their mirth inclin'd,</L>
<L>While tender thoughts rush'd on my fancy,</L>
<L>And my warm sighs increas'd the wind,</L>
<L>Look'd on the moon, and thought of Nancy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And now arriv'd that jovial night,</L>
<L>When every true bred tar carouses,</L>
<L>When o'er the grog all hands delight,</L>
<L>To toast their sweethearts and their spouses</L>
<L>Round went the cann, the jest, the glee,</L>
<L>While tender wishes fill'd each fancy,</L>
<L>And when in turn it came to me,</L>
<L>I heav'd a sigh, and toasted Nancy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Next morn a storm came on at four,</L>
<L>At six the elements in motion;</L>
<L>Plung'd me and three poor sailors more,</L>
<L>Headlong within the foaming ocean:</L>
<L>Poor wretches they soon found their graves,</L>
<L>For me it may be only fancy,</L>
<L>But love seem'd to forbid the waves,</L>
<L>To snatch me from the arms of Nancy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Scarce the foul hurricane was clear'd,</L>
<L>And winds and waves had ceas'd to rattle,</L>
<L>When a bold enemy appear'd,</L>
<L>And, dauntless, we prepar'd for battle;</L>
<L>And now, while some lov'd friend or wife,</L>
<L>Like light'ning rush'd on ev'ry fancy,</L>
<L>To Providence I trusted life,</L>
<L>Put up a prayer, and thought of Nancy.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>At last, 'twas in the month of May,</L>
<L>The crew, it being lovely weather,</L>
<L>At three A. M. discover'd day,</L>
<L>And England's chalky cliffs together;</L>
<L>At seven, up Channel, how we bore,</L>
<L>While hopes and fears rush'd on my fancy;</L>
<L>At twelve I gaily jumpt on shore,</L>

<P><HI>Och, she was a sweet creature! with a bloom on her face like a Munster potatoe—I met her going to market one morning with a basket under one of her arms,—Where do you come from my dear? says I.
