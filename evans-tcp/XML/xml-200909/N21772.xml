<HEAD>THE FEMALE CHARACTER VINDICATED.</HEAD>
<P>INJUDICIOUS censure rarely ef∣fects reformation—the shafts of ridicule are formidable to the votories of folly— but unless aimed by accurate judgment and pointed by skill, prove not only un∣availing and futile, but also wound the interest of humanity: Wit rolled forth without discretion, often, nay always, precipitates the author into base invective and scurrilous slander. It is really to be lamented, that in every age our best satiri∣cal writers have indulged themselves in this, and laid aside all candour, modesty, and justice, in treating of the <HI>fair sex,</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="028664_0003_0FDA3E1E762A2278"/>and have uniformly degraded their brilliant effusions of wit and humour, with the tartest sneers of malignity. The morose moralist, the snarling cynic, and bigotted enthusiast, all concur in maintaining opin∣ions unfavourable to the fairer half of the human race. How base, how degrading in a gentleman, to indulge himself in in∣humanity where he knows no opposition will be made! The blackest dye is infi∣nitely too white to draw his portrait—he dares not step forth and asperse characters where he knows he will be bravely oppos∣ed—but sneaks, with the assassin, and stabs the unarmed—he is bold and intrepid where no danger appears—he is basely in∣human where his opponent cannot resist— such is the character of every coward— Recoil O humanity at the scene! Weep O true and virtuous valour! In the aera when bodily strength was the sole <HI>virtue</HI> and criterion of merit, then I grant wo∣men were justly considered as inferior— but now, when it is the mental accom∣plishments that form the <HI>man</HI>—now, when real merit is the criterion of greatness, why should the artillery of sarcasm be levelled at the citadel of semale excel∣lence? Who can read the writings of
<PB N="5" REF="028664_0004_0FDA3DFE18F7E438"/>Swift upon this subject, without perceiv∣ing his feelings raised, even to perfect ab∣horrence? Who can realize the satires of the immortal Young, as sentiments really candid, without lamenting his irrecovera∣ble disgrace? In his Night thoughts, he draws the character of his wife and daugh∣ter with the pencil of perfection, and re∣flects honour on the whole sex. In his Satires on Women, he descends to scurri∣lity and invective, and (pardon the expres∣sion) holds forth ideas familiar only to the debauchee—how does reason, how does charity recoil at viewing a man of pro∣found sense, of consummate erudition, and of renowned piety, exposing those unjust∣ly who cannot vindicate their cause. It really shews the want of true greatness for a man, when h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has exaulted his fund of ideas, to sink to this last refort of <HI>dupe,</HI> and make those who are the grand link in the social chain, the objects of indis∣criminate censure. Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>re men of cha∣racter indulge themselves in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, they should accurately investigate the cause of the difference between the tw<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>xes, and prove that they are natu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ally more deprav∣ed, inferior, and unworthy our friendly in∣tercourse. The cause of the disparity be∣tween
<PB N="6" REF="028664_0005_0FDA3E219A67EB10"/>the two sexes, appears so obvious to need but little explication; which I conceive to exist wholly in the degree and method of their education.—"'Tis education forms the tender mind."</P>
<P>That the ladies are as capable of eru∣dition as the men, cannot be denied by those capable of observation—only visit a common English school—does not incon∣testible experience declare, that there the ladies make the most accurate and rapid progress? It is futile and ridiculous to as∣sert, that the ladies are capable of a certain degree of education only—and that a de∣gree far below the abilities of men—with more apparent propriety it may be assert∣ed of him who roves the desert with the less savage brute.</P>
<P>The education of the females has been such as could scarcely fail to debase the mind, and at the same time to inflate it with vanity. Romances generally consti∣tute the whole of their library, which, as to improvement, are empty as the wind, they are good when kept in proper bounds but tend to engross the whole attention, vitiate the taste, and render <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he peruser as full of self-importance as though she was the very character before and to whom all
<PB N="7" REF="028664_0006_0FDA3DFFB48C9F18"/>adoration and apparent devotion should be paid. The ladies have had no incitement to noble undertakings—custom has long declared that the cultivation of the mental powers is not their especial business—a liberal education has been uniformly deni∣ed them—and when attempted, has render∣ed them the objects of mirth and raillery— the cold hand of prejudice has closely sealed every door of the temple of Fame against them—<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in spite of these disad∣vantages, many have shone with superior lustre—many have proved themselves ca∣pable of swaying the sceptre of empires— many have awoke to extacy the harmoni∣ous lyre. America can boast of three, unrivalled in the annals of history—Eng∣land shines with a Seward, a Chapone, a Moore, and a Rowe—and France, per∣haps never nurtured a more sublime mo∣ralist or a keener satirest than her boasted Montague.</P>
<P>But this is not the ground, declaimers against semale excellence wish to tread on—they know it to be difficultly tenable —they sneak into the corner of error—ral∣ly round the standard of slander, and level their artillery with more than manly cou∣rage at semale weakness, vices, and vani∣ties.
<PB N="8" REF="028664_0007_0FDA3E23931BA9A0"/>While we touch at some of their delightful topics, we shall spurn every thing really obscene, and just remark, that in this the female character stands infinitely above the long catalogue of often failing yet always persuaded debauchees. We shall consider two things which are gen∣erally the subjects of satire, and render the fair, in the eyes of our too-refined gentlemen, the objects of contempt, viz. Dress and Detraction. Our modern de∣claimers cry out, Oh dress, thou first, thou vilest fruit of man's apostacy? Such a declamation really looks well coming from a gentleman who is a beau in its full extent. This is precept and exam∣ple going hand in hand.</P>
<P>But even supposing it were true that the ladies are more careful to furbish and dress their persons than to improve their minds—have they not a reasonable, nay, a just excuse? Are not beauty and show of wealth what every one of us worship: The character of a gentlemen is formed from his conduct and mental abilities—a lady's most frequently from her appear∣ance—a gentleman attracts the attention of the ladi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s by his character, his station in life, his proposal—a lady draws the at∣tention
<PB N="9" REF="028664_0008_0FDA3E02D1ACBC08"/>of a gentleman altogether by her beauty, joined with modest conduct— mental accomplishments are not looked for in her to a great degree—a lady can∣not live independent, and custom says she must not choose until she be chosen—it must therefore be right for her to use those means by which custom says she will most probably be chosen. Suppose a lady pays little or no attention to dress, reads all day, talks of Saturn's belt, Herschel's aerology, osteology, dioptics, and politics, who will ever be her suitor? So power∣ful are the effects of custom in this, that unless a lady dresses neatly, and in some degree according to her ability, she would attract but very few or no admirers of our sex, and would sigh out an existence of comfortless celibacy.</P>
<P>The next crime, in point of turpidity and frequency, with which the ladies have been charged, is merciless detraction. In this, as in dress, precept and example coin∣cide. Perhaps in this very act the de∣claimer, by stigmatizing the whole sex for the conduct of a very few, exhibits as true a specimen of detraction as could possibly be adduced. The cup of life is surely sufficiently bitter without additional
<PB N="10" REF="028664_0009_0FDA3E275737FC28"/>gall. Who but must execrate the wretch who poisons enjoyment with the bane of scandal. The slanderer destroys all con∣fidence in friendship, kindles the flame of discord, and transmutes our fairest hopes of harmonious society into the direful dis∣cord of infernals. To this detestable vice we are all prone; it is connate with human nature; and who can affirm that the ladies with the greatest pleasure sip this with their tea, and not also believe that the gentlemen drink it in full draughts with their grog.</P>
<P>Sympathy is an universal characteristic of the fair—their feelings are more ten∣der, and their solt affections more easily moved; and does not this run directly counter to detraction?—Why then brand them alone with that propensity from which their natures appear more averse than those of men: And are the ladies really more prone to this than men? Or is it merely because they, for want of oth∣er subjects for conversation, have more frequently to talk of characters? Gentle∣men have a variety of subjects both public and private, which afford topics for con∣versation, of which the ladies are altogeth∣er deprived—the topics of their conversa∣tion
<PB N="11" REF="028664_0010_0FDA3E2A65191DB8"/>are little more extensive than the cir∣cle of their acquaitance. Some ladies, I must confess, are shamefully prone to detraction; but must the whole sex be stigmatized for the frailties of a few: Where is the sect, even among sacred de∣nominations, where the whole, according to this test of merit, might not be stig∣matized with the most opprobrious epi∣thets—Although my acquaintance with mankind is but small, yet even in detrac∣tion, as many might be chosen among men of its votaries, as amongst the fair. Then with the same propriety may our sex be branded with this, of all crimes the most detestable.</P>
<P>I sincerely believe the reason why our sex indulge themselves in such base invec∣tive against the ladies, is because we are conscious that our vices in swearing, drink∣ing, &amp;c. of which they are clear, and which debase us below the level with the brute, vastly over-run the catalogne of fe∣male frailties, not only in the baseness of the act, but also in the subsequent evilness of the consequences; and therefore, in order to strike a parallel with the other sex, we must invent new vices for them— make those peculiar of which we equally
<PB N="12" REF="028664_0011_0FDA3E2C97ADB8C8"/>partake—and paint small ones with the brightest dye. Is this generous? Is it not glaring inhumanity? Does it bespeak that candour and attachment to truth which should always characterize the no∣ble mind—the man of sense—the <HI>truly re∣fined gentleman?</HI></P>
