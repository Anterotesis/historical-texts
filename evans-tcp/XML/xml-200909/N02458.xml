<P>AND therefore there is no Man in the Auditory <HI>at this Time,</HI> who <HI>knows</HI> any other but that <HI>This</HI> may be the <HI>Last Time</HI> of his being here; For ought that any One <HI>knows,</HI> This may be the <HI>Last Sabbath</HI> he shall have shining on him; This the <HI>Last Sermon</HI> he shall have speaking to him.

<PB N="2" REF="002913_0004_0FE694ABB1D508C8"/>
<P>—A Young Gentleman,<NOTE N="*">Mr. SAMUEL HIRST.</NOTE> Descended of wor∣thy <HI>Progenitors;</HI> Accomplished with the Advantages of a Liberal as well as Religious <HI>Education;</HI> Recommended unto the <HI>Loves</HI> &amp; <HI>Hopes</HI> of his Friends by many Desireable circum∣stances; After very little more than <HI>Three Times Seven Years</HI> of Appearance in the World; Be to all Apprehension in perfect Health; in the midst of Business, and of Company;— And — But here the Story Stops! — <HI>At once</HI> to fall down <HI>Dead</HI> in the Street! — The Mounting &amp; Glowing <HI>Spark,</HI> in a Moment go out, and fall down into the com∣mon Heap of Ashes! — This is a <HI>Paraphrase,</HI> which the Great GOD has just now given us, on, <HI>Man knows not his Time.</HI> An affecting Pa∣raphrase! <HI>Go to now, ye that say, To Morrow we will do this or that! ye know not what shall be on the Morrow. What is your Life? It is even a vapour that appears for a little time, and then vanishes away.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the matter must be further look'd into.</P>
<P>MY Text is found in a Book Entituled, <HI>The Preacher.</HI> It seems, the Things which are in this Book insisted on, are such as it well becomes a <HI>Preacher</HI> to insist upon. We have here the <HI>Re∣tractations</HI> of a <HI>Solomon,</HI> writing a Treatise upon, <HI>The Chief End of Man;</HI> An Aged <HI>Solomon,</HI> after much Experience, confessing his own Errors, and correcting of ours, upon that Important Subject. The Word which we render, <HI>The Preacher,</HI> carries in it some Intimations of, <HI>A Soul upon Recollection.</HI> We have here that Enquiry managed, <HI>What is
<PB N="3" REF="002913_0005_0FE694E08B3A67A8"/>true Happiness?</HI> And, <HI>How,</HI> or <HI>Where,</HI> is <HI>true Hap∣piness</HI> is to be met withal! Upon a Serious <HI>Re∣collection,</HI> it is here pronounced, That our <HI>Tem∣poral Happiness</HI> is to <HI>Enjoy Chearfully</HI> what we <HI>Possess Honestly.</HI> But, Wo to that Man, who Stops here; who is put off so; who knows none but a <HI>Temporal Happiness.</HI> There is an <HI>Eternal Happiness,</HI> which a Man ought always and chiefly to be concern'd about : An <HI>Happiness</HI> to be found in the Day when <HI>G O D shall bring every work into Judgment.</HI> And the way to obtain this <HI>Happiness</HI> is for a Man to <HI>Fear G O D and keep His Commandments.</HI> In the prosecution of these things, very pertinent are the Remarks made in this Book, upon the Di∣verse <HI>Vanities,</HI> whereof Men do in this Life un∣dergo the grievous <HI>Vexations.</HI> One of those Di∣verse <HI>Vanities,</HI> is Remark'd in the Text before us; <HI>Man knoweth not his Time.</HI> It refers to such occurrences, as the preceeding Verse takes notice of. <HI>Time</HI> intends the <HI>Changes</HI> which befalls us in <HI>Time;</HI> The <HI>Changes</HI> which are also called <HI>Chances,</HI> because we see not the Causes of them. The <HI>Reasons</HI> as well as the <HI>Seasons</HI> are secret unto us. But above all, <HI>Time</HI> intends the end of our <HI>Time.</HI> It is our <HI>Death</HI> which is our <HI>Time :</HI> The <HI>Time</HI> wherein we are to <HI>Dy,</HI> and we are to have no more <HI>Time</HI> allow'd unto us. The un∣certainty of this <HI>Time,</HI> wherein it pleases the Holy <HI>Lord of Time,</HI> who <HI>Inhabits Eternity</HI> to keep us, has here some elegant Illustrations and Re∣semblances. The <HI>Fish</HI> Knows not the <HI>Time</HI> of its being taken in the <HI>Nett.</HI> The <HI>Bird</HI> knows not
<PB N="4" REF="002913_0006_0FE694ADECB7C8D0"/>the <HI>Time</HI> of its being taken in the <HI>Snare;</HI> So are Men <HI>Suddenly</HI> taken by the <HI>Evil-Time</HI> of a <HI>Dying Hour.</HI> The <HI>Netts</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> are spread for us. The <HI>Snares</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> are laid for us. <HI>Man knows not the Time</HI> of his being taken in them.</P>
<P>ATTEND unto a DOCTRINE of an Im∣portance as Useful as Awful, to be at <HI>all Times</HI> thought upon.</P>
<P><HI>LITTLE do People know the Times that are hereafter to pass over them : Little do we know what Changes are to come, and when they are to come upon us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>CONTINGENCIES</HI> are Things which we cannot have a <HI>certain knowledge</HI> of. Tis at best, but an <HI>Opinion,</HI> tis at best but a <HI>Conjecture,</HI> that we can have of them. Now, with respect unto <HI>us,</HI> what are all <HI>Futurities,</HI> but <HI>Contingencies.</HI></P>
<P>MY DOCTRINE is a String which the Quill of <HI>Solomon</HI> did very much harp upon. And most certainly the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of a <HI>Solomon</HI> could not be express'd without Strong Impressions from such a Meditation. Tis bewailed by <HI>Solomon</HI> as the <HI>Misery of Man,</HI> Eccl. VIII. 7. <HI>He knoweth not that which shall be; For who can tell him when it shall be!</HI> Oh! may we have the <HI>Wisdom</HI> to make our <HI>Advantage</HI> of this <HI>Misery;</HI> since we do know what we have to do, that we may be pre∣pared for <HI>that which shall be.</HI></P>
<P>THIS, This is the Tendency of the Meditation upon which we are now proceeding.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="002913_0007_0FE694E68926F8C8"/>
<P>WE will Inquire, First, <HI>What is there in the Times passing over us, which we must not have the Fore-knowledge of?</HI></P>
<P>TWO words will fully eno' express the matter.</P>
<P>First LITTLE do we <HI>Fore-know</HI> the <HI>Quantity</HI> of our <HI>Time;</HI> or what will be the <HI>Duration</HI> of it. <HI>Man knoweth not his Time;</HI> in that he <HI>knows not,</HI> whether it will be a <HI>Longer Time,</HI> or a <HI>Shorter Time.</HI> As it has been said, <HI>What man is he that liveth, and shall not see Death?</HI> So it may be said, <HI>What man alive is there, who knows when he shall see Death?</HI> We are told, <HI>The living know that they shall Dy.</HI> But which of the <HI>Living</HI> are they who <HI>know when they are to Dye?</HI> The <HI>Presa∣ges</HI> that some few have had of their <HI>Time,</HI> are extraordinary! One said, Gen XXVII. 2. <HI>I am old, I know not the Day of my Death.</HI> And the <HI>Young</HI> does as little <HI>know the Day of his Death.</HI> It is an ancient saying, <HI>If an old Man has Death standing before his Face, a young Man has Death standing behind his Back.</HI> The <HI>Time</HI> of its giving the <HI>Fatal stroke,</HI> is as little known to the one, as to the other. <HI>One that is in his full strength, being wholly at ease and quiet, and having his Bones moistned with morrow;</HI> Even such an one does <HI>not know his Time;</HI> for even such an one may <HI>Dy</HI> at <HI>this</HI> very <HI>Time. One that is in Bitterness of Soul, and never Eats with pleasure,</HI> because of the Infirmities under what he languishes; even such an one also does <HI>not know his Time.</HI> For even such an one may be Repriev'd from <HI>Death</HI> beyond expectation; and see many <HI>Stronger</HI> ones <HI>ly down in the Dust</HI> before him. We do all know, That <HI>it
<PB N="6" REF="002913_0008_0FE694AE521958B8"/>is appointed unto man once to dy.</HI> But which of us does <HI>know his appointed Time</HI> for it; or when he is to <HI>Dy?</HI> Ordinarily, <HI>of that Day &amp; Hour knoweth no Man.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly, LITTLE do we <HI>Foreknow</HI> the <HI>Qua∣lity</HI> of our <HI>Time;</HI> or what we are to <HI>Encounter</HI> in it. Shall we have a <HI>Good Time,</HI> or a <HI>Bad Time</HI> of it? <HI>Man knoweth not!</HI> In our <HI>Time</HI> shall we see Days of <HI>Pleasure,</HI> or Days of <HI>Sorrow? Man know∣eth not!</HI> Shall we have our <HI>Time</HI> sweetned with much <HI>Prosperity,</HI> or embittered with much <HI>Ad∣versity? Man knoweth not!</HI> The World may not prove either so <HI>Good</HI> as we <HI>hope,</HI> or so <HI>Bad</HI> as we <HI>fear?</HI> 'Tis most commonly so. Some look for a <HI>sadder Time</HI> than ever does arrive unto them. So did the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Hero, when he said, <HI>I shall one day perish by the hand of Saul.</HI> But much oft∣ner do Men look for a <HI>better Time,</HI> than what anon comes unto them. They say, <HI>I shall never be moved;</HI> But, GOD <HI>hides His Face, and they are Troubled.</HI> When <HI>Joseph</HI> was a Prisoner and his <HI>Foot they did humble with the affliction of a chain; The Iron, that did penetrate into his very Soul:</HI> Did he <HI>know</HI> what was to be done for him, when the King <HI>constituted him to be the Ruler of his House; yea, and the Governour of all that was possess'd by him.</HI> When <HI>Haman</HI> was in all the Grandeur of the <HI>Persion</HI> Court, and the chief Mi∣nister of State there; Did he <HI>know</HI> how near he and his Family were, to a matchless confusion? What <HI>Accidents</HI> we are to meet withal, whether <HI>Joyful</HI> Accidents, or <HI>Woful</HI> Accidents, we must not <HI>know,</HI> indeed so much as one day before hand.
<PB N="7" REF="002913_0009_0FE694E6A31A2908"/>So we are admonished; Prov. XXVII. 1. <HI>Thou knowest not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> O Man, Thou <HI>knowest not,</HI> what may <HI>This Day</HI> befall thee in thy Person, in thy Family, in thy Interest. Thou <HI>knowest not</HI> what may be the <HI>Tidings</HI> that will <HI>This Day</HI> be brought unto thee. Thou <HI>know∣est not</HI> in the <HI>Evening</HI> what may befall thee be∣fore the <HI>Morning,</HI> or in the <HI>Morning</HI> what shall befall thee before the <HI>Evening;</HI> Any more than the Men upon whom the <HI>Tower of Siloam fell,</HI> that the <HI>Tower</HI> was to fall, while they were un∣der it.</P>
<P>THE Articles wherein you have had set be∣fore you, the <HI>Future Events</HI> of our <HI>Times,</HI> where∣of our GOD will keep us in the greatest <HI>Uncer∣tainties,</HI> are then these Two; First, That which is the greatest of all our <HI>Changes;</HI> And, then, all the <HI>Changes</HI> which may before That come up∣on us. Our Meditation must not easily, and pre∣sently dismiss these Articles of our <HI>Times</HI> which are <HI>unknown</HI> unto us. But before we pass any further, Let an earnest EXHORTATION pre∣vail with us, To <HI>Entertain this Meditation, and he duely affected with it.</HI> Oh! may this Thought be often rolling in our Minds; <HI>I know not my Time, nor do I know any thing that is to befal me in my Time!</HI> And may our Minds feel the power of it; bring our Lives under the power of it! The very <HI>Pagans</HI> would sometimes give an Entertain∣ment unto this Meditation; and say, <HI>Nescis quid serus Vesper vebat;</HI> O Man, Thou knowest not what may before Night be to come upon thee. Certainly, It becomes <HI>Christians</HI> to give a more
<PB N="8" REF="002913_0010_0FE694B7265998B0"/>affecting entertainment unto such a Meditation.</P>
<P>First; THE case of <HI>Mortality</HI> is above all to be thus considered; That <HI>Man knows not his Time,</HI> when his <HI>Mortality</HI> must have the Opera∣tion of it finished. Man lies under a <HI>Sentence</HI> of <HI>Death;</HI> and the <HI>Time</HI> for <HI>Execution</HI> is <HI>determined</HI> with GOD; <HI>Lord, The number of our Months is with thee; Thou hast appointed our Bounds, that we cannot pass.</HI> But Man must not <HI>know the Time,</HI> until the Executioner come and bring the Bow-string. There is no <HI>Day</HI> that breaks upon any Man, but for ought he <HI>knows, His Time is come, and the Day of his Death. Sudden Deaths</HI> are some of those Things, whereto all Men living are exposed. We find it supposed, Numb VI. 9. <HI>A man may die very suddenly.</HI> 'Tis what we see fulfill'd on great <HI>Numbers;</HI> We need not for the proof of it quote the Book of <HI>Numbers.</HI> The commissions which our glotious GOD gives to the <HI>Angel of Death</HI> are often kept secret until the very Day, that he comes and swears unto them, <HI>No more Time</HI> shall be given them. It may be the Portion of <HI>Wicked Men</HI> to <HI>Dy suddenly.</HI> The profane Men, who can say of the Thing they never once thought upon, <HI>They thought no more of it than of their Dying Day;</HI> find it according to their word; Their <HI>Dying Day</HI> comes at a <HI>Time</HI> which they <HI>thought not</HI> of. The Men of <HI>Sodom;</HI> Did they <HI>know their Time?</HI> A bright fair, Sun∣shiny Morning, found them wallowing in all Im∣purities; Before Night the <HI>Vengeance of Eternal Fire</HI> came down upon them. The <HI>Egyptians;</HI> Did they <HI>know their Time?</HI> In the Morning
<PB N="9" REF="002913_0011_0FE694E8F06FA880"/>they were full of brave Expectations to divide <HI>Spoils</HI> and <HI>Slaves</HI> among them, and to do won∣drous Exploits. That Night they were Drown'd, and Damn'd; the <HI>Sea covered them.</HI> The <HI>Phi∣listines;</HI> Did they <HI>know their Time?</HI> In the Morning they had nothing in their Eye, but the <HI>Sports</HI> of an Holiday. E're the Night came, they were crush'd all to pieces. <HI>Ananias &amp; Sapphira;</HI> Did they <HI>know their Time.</HI> They came out well to the Meeting, and they are carried home Dead! It may be the Portion of <HI>Godly Men</HI> also to <HI>Dy suddenly.</HI> It may be a Privilege granted by GOD unto some of His most Favoured ones, to <HI>Dy</HI> such a <HI>Death. Uzzah,</HI> Did he <HI>know his Time;</HI> In the Morning of the Day, when the <HI>Ark</HI> was to be carried into the City of <HI>David?</HI> or, The Prophet sent unto <HI>Jeroboam;</HI> Did he <HI>know his Time,</HI> in the Morning of the Day when the <HI>Lion</HI> fell upon him? Others less obnoxious find it so.</P>
<P>Yea, Secondly; THE Case of every <HI>Calamity</HI> is thus to be considered. <HI>Man knows not his Time,</HI> when that <HI>Calamity</HI> will befal him, wherein GOD will <HI>perform the Thing that is appointed for him.</HI> One that has an <HI>Husband,</HI> or a <HI>Father,</HI> in the Morn∣ing, does not <HI>know,</HI> but before Night, the state of a <HI>Widow,</HI> or an <HI>Orphan</HI> may be Theirs: The <HI>Sun</HI> may <HI>set at Noon</HI> with us, and leave us in a <HI>Sud∣den Darkness.</HI> A <HI>Job</HI> has his <HI>House</HI> full of <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> in the Morning; but he does not know that before Night, he shall have neither <HI>House</HI> nor <HI>Children</HI> left unto him. In this evil World, every Man knows, that his Dependence may be like that of the Apostles, <HI>Afflictions wait for me:</HI> But
<PB N="10" REF="002913_0012_0FE694B7460100A8"/>then he must add like the Apostle. Act. XX. 22. <HI>Not knowing the Things that shall befal me.</HI> And much more, <HI>Not knowing the Time when they shall befal me.</HI></P>
<P>IT was counted a Flight of Wisdom; <HI>All that I know, is that I know nothing!</HI> It will be wisely done of us to make the <HI>knowledge</HI> of our <HI>Igno∣rance</HI> in this point, as efficacious as may be upon us; <HI>This I know, that man knoweth not his Time.</HI></P>
<P>WE will enquire, Secondly; <HI>Whence is it, that we must not have the Fore-knowledge of the Times that are to pass over us?</HI></P>
<P>Now, First; THERE is for it, the <HI>First Reason</HI> of all things; the grand <HI>Reason of all Reasons.</HI> The <HI>Sovereign will</HI> of GOD; That is <HI>Reason</HI> enough. The <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of the Great GOD will be maintained in it. It was a just Acknow∣ledgment; Psal. XXXI. 15. <HI>O Lord, my Times are in thy Hand.</HI> It was a just Admonition; Act. I. 7. <HI>It is not for you to know the Times, which the Father has put in His own power.</HI> All that shall befall us in our <HI>Times,</HI> is Decreed by the GOD that made us. Now, the <HI>Decree</HI> is by our So∣vereign kept a <HI>Secret:</HI> For <HI>such is His will and pleasure,</HI> that it should be so. There is a Glori∣ous One, who is in our Translation of the Bible, called, <HI>The Ancient of Days.</HI> The Original is, <HI>The Appointer of Times.</HI> 'Tis fit, that our <HI>Times</HI> remain <HI>unknown</HI> to any but Him that has the <HI>Appointing</HI> of the <HI>Times.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, there is more than this to be said of the matter.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="002913_0013_0FE694E9114DDAF8"/>
<P>First, IT is from the <HI>Pitty</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> of our Gracious GOD unto the poor Children of Men, that they must not <HI>know their Time,</HI> nor what is to befall them in their <HI>Time.</HI></P>
<P>IT may well be ascribed unto the <HI>Pitty</HI> of our GOD, That we do <HI>not know our Time;</HI> For such <HI>a knowledge</HI> would very much destroy the <HI>comfort</HI> of our <HI>Time;</HI> very much make for us a most un∣comfortable <HI>Time,</HI> Here, Here, most emphati∣cally; <HI>He that increaseth Knowledge increaseth Sorrow.</HI> It would mightily take away the <HI>com∣fort</HI> which we take in any thing under the Sun, if we knew aforehand, <HI>When</HI> and <HI>How</HI> we are to take our leave of that <HI>comfort.</HI> It is reported concerning <HI>Elisha,</HI> 2 King. VIII. 11, 12. <HI>The man of God wept; And Hazael said, Why weepeth my Lord? And he answered, Because I know the evil, that thou wilt do.</HI> Thus, If a Man <HI>know the evil Time</HI> that is to befall himself, or his House, and the <HI>Time</HI> of the <HI>Evil,</HI> he would fall a <HI>weeping</HI> at it; into such a <HI>weeping,</HI> that he would be able to find little Relish in the gifts of GOD unto him. The <HI>Anticipations</HI> of <HI>Trouble</HI> would break the Hearts of Men, if they knew before hand all the <HI>Trouble</HI> that is to come upon them, and the <HI>Time</HI> when it will come. Our Lord has told us; Math. VI. 34. <HI>Sufficient unto the Day is the evil thereof.</HI> It will be soon enough to <HI>know the evil,</HI> when the <HI>Day</HI> comes. If we should <HI>know the evil</HI> before the <HI>Day,</HI> it would multiply exceedingly, &amp; keep growing &amp; growing, and scalding upon us; we should be more scalded before it falls, than we should be in the Actual Falling of it. It is a most
<PB N="12" REF="002913_0014_0FE694B864725280"/>conspicuous Difference between a <HI>Man,</HI> &amp; a <HI>Bruit.</HI> And I look upon it, as no despicable Argument, that <HI>Man</HI> is made for a World that is <HI>to come.</HI> A <HI>Man</HI> has a strong Apprehension of what is <HI>to come :</HI> And what he <HI>knows</HI> is <HI>to come,</HI> he feels it Exquisitely, he feels it Wonderfully. Oh! Should many a Man <HI>know, At such a Time, shall my House be laid in Ashes;</HI> Or, <HI>At such a Time, a Relative that is the Desire of my Eyes will be taken from me:</HI> Or, <HI>at such a Time I shall my self be carried unto my long Home, and the Mourners for me shall walk about the Streets;</HI> Verily, this <HI>knowledge</HI> would cause an unspeaka∣ble Anguish in him. Such a <HI>knowledge</HI> of our <HI>Time,</HI> would cause a cry to be heard among us, like that which was once heard in <HI>Aegypt;</HI> A cry whereof they kept an Anniversary comme∣moration among them, for many Ages.</P>
<P>Again; IT may be ascribed unto the <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD, that we do <HI>not know our Time.</HI> For, hereby we come the better to <HI>Know</HI> and to <HI>Do,</HI> the <HI>Duty</HI> of our <HI>Time.</HI> Here is indeed an <HI>Igno∣rance,</HI> that is very truly, and very justly, the <HI>Mother of Devotion.</HI> Our <HI>not knowing our Time,</HI> and the Things to come, does train us up, to a <HI>Filial Faith</HI> in the <HI>Fatherly Care,</HI> of the Lord, who only has all those Things in His own Hands. We read; Jam. IV. 14, 15. <HI>Ye know not what shall be on the Morrow;—Ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this or that.</HI> We Refer our selves to the <HI>Will of GOD,</HI> with the more of <HI>Resignation;</HI> a most humble and lovely <HI>Resignation;</HI> because we <HI>know not what shall be on
<PB N="13" REF="002913_0015_0FE694F3F14C3188"/>the Morrow.</HI> And our <HI>Preparation,</HI> a Watchful and Prayerful <HI>Preparation</HI> for the worst that may happen to us; This is promoted by our <HI>not knowing our Time,</HI> and what shall happen to us. It is pressed upon us; Mar. XIII. 33. <HI>Take heed, watch, and pray; for ye know not when the Time is.</HI> Because we <HI>know not the Time,</HI> when we or ours are to Dy, or what is to befall us; If this won't put us upon <HI>Watching</HI> and <HI>Praying,</HI> and keep us in a way of Holy walking, I don't know what will! <HI>I know not my Time, nor what I am to see in a very Little Time.</HI> A Man of any sense will think so. But Methinks, One that has the least grain of sense, must go on to think; <HI>I desire now to keep alive the constant Fear of GOD, all the Time that He shall allow me; I de∣sire to be armed with Patience and Submission, for all the uneasy Things which in my Remaining Time I may find reserved for me.</HI> Sirs, we must yield a <HI>Blindfold Obedience</HI> unto GOD; This <HI>Blindfold Obedience</HI> is a <HI>Well aim'd Obedience.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. THERE is a Dreadful <HI>Judgment</HI> of GOD, upon <HI>Wicked Men</HI> in it, that they must not <HI>know their Time.</HI> The wrath of GOD upon <HI>Wicked Men</HI> must overtake them. After what manner must it overtake them? We read; Psal. XI. 6. <HI>Upon the wicked He shall rain snares— and an horrible tempest,</HI> We read; Psal. LXXIII. 18, 19. <HI>Surely, Thou hast set them in slippery places; — How are they brought into Desolation, as in a Moment?</HI> Of the Wicked Man, we are told; Psal. XXXVII. 13. <HI>The Lord shall laugh at him, for He sees that his Day is coming.</HI> Why;
<PB N="14" REF="002913_0016_0FE694B8847C21E0"/>The Man does <HI>not see</HI> it himself! This gives a greater Triumph to the <HI>Justice</HI> of GOD, in the <HI>Day</HI> that comes upon him. The Vengeance of GOD upon a wicked Man, must come <HI>Irresistibly.</HI> It comes <HI>at once,</HI> and that makes it the more <HI>Irresistible.</HI> A <HI>Whirlwind</HI> of <HI>Wrath</HI> must come upon a wicked Man. A <HI>Whirlwind,</HI> that must rise <HI>at once.</HI> It must gather <HI>Suddenly,</HI> It must be big with terrible <HI>Thunder.</HI> It must break him to pieces, before he has any <HI>Time</HI> to look about him. He must <HI>not know his Time.</HI> No; He must be <HI>Surprized</HI> by the Vengeance of GOD.</P>
<P>BUT now, Let us make our more particular Improvement of these Faithful sayings.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> SINCE our GOD will not let us <HI>know our Time,</HI> we must beware of <HI>curious Inquiries</HI> after the Future Events of our <HI>Time.</HI> There is a certain Prerogative, of which <HI>Vain Man that would be wise,</HI> is very ambitious; That is, that <HI>Prerogative</HI> of <HI>Divination:</HI> Men would fain <HI>know their Time,</HI> and what is to come hereafter. And, how many cursed Arts of <HI>Divination</HI> have been invented for the gratification of this <HI>Curi∣osity!</HI> But, O vain Man, Thou liftest up thy hand unto a Forbidden <HI>Tree of Knowledge,</HI> when thou art Inquisitive about Futurities. Take the Rebuke of GOD; Deut. XXIX. 29. <HI>Secret Things belong unto the Lord our GOD.</HI> Indeed there are some <HI>Things to come,</HI> whereof we may commendably &amp; profitably be Inquisitive; But they are such Things as our GOD has <HI>Reveled</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="002913_0017_0FE694F410055D38"/>unto us, in the Prophecies of our Bible. These are Things, which <HI>Piety</HI> would make us <HI>Desire to look into.</HI> The Tribe which has <HI>Understanding in the Times,</HI> is to be applauded for it. They who <HI>Descern not the Signs of the Times,</HI> to be up∣braided for it. But what is this, to the Impious and Criminal <HI>Curiosity</HI> of them, who will needs be prying into Faturities, which GOD will have to be concealed from us? I tell you, The <HI>Beth∣shemites</HI> might as well pry into the Ark of GOD. For Men to grasp after such a <HI>Knowledge</HI> of their <HI>Time,</HI> as may indispose them for a modest wait∣ing upon the Providence of GOD; Verily, 'Tis a great Iniquity. Hence, to consult <HI>Astrologers</HI> and <HI>Fortune-tellers,</HI> about our <HI>Time,</HI> and the E∣vents thereof; 'Tis a Crime; As to <HI>Believe</HI> them, 'tis a Weakness, 'tis a Madness. Those <HI>Prophetasters;</HI> Pittiful <HI>Jugglers</HI> Mankind strangely degrade and disgrace themselves, by suffering those <HI>Jugglers</HI> to impose upon them. Indeed, they have no <HI>Rules</HI> worth a straw to go by. If they do any thing to purpose, 'tis by a <HI>Satanical Impulse.</HI> Their pretended <HI>Rules of Art</HI> are meer cheats. And the wretches themselves usually have such <HI>Tragical,</HI> but <HI>Unforeseen</HI> Things befalling of them, 'tis marvellous that the credit of the <HI>whole Sect</HI> is not for ever Extinguished. Indeed, one can't but wonder, as the Roman Ora∣tor long ago did about their <HI>Augurs,</HI> how the wretches can look one another in the Face, with∣out a scornful sneer at the cheats which they a∣gree to put upon the <HI>Vast Herd</HI> that pay Regard unto them. <HI>Christians,</HI> Indulge not the Vice of
<PB N="16" REF="002913_0018_0FE75E04B9A5EF40"/>a Mind Curious to <HI>know your Time.</HI> 'Tis a crime, that will ripen People for the punishments which use to come upon Sinners, when they have quite <HI>fill'd up the measure of their Iniquity.</HI> We have seen fearful Examples of Persons, that have gone to <HI>Forbidden-ways</HI> of coming at the <HI>knowledge of their Time,</HI> and they have never seen one Good Day after it. When <HI>Soul</HI> was gone so far, as to consult a <HI>Witch,</HI> Then the wrath of GOD would bear no longer with him!</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II</HI> WE must not <HI>know our Time;</HI> Then 'tis a Folly for us, to <HI>presume</HI> upon a <HI>Time,</HI> which our GOD has given us no Assurance of. Such is the Folly of them, who presume upon an <HI>Hap∣py Time,</HI> while they make it a <HI>Time</HI> of Impiety, a <HI>Time</HI> of Impenitence, a <HI>Day of Provocation.</HI> O presumpteous ones, In all the word of GOD, where have you a promise of an <HI>Happy Time,</HI> for un∣godly People, <HI>going on still in their Trespasses?</HI> Yea, such is the Folly of all, who presume that their <HI>Time</HI> will always be <HI>just what it is.</HI> For Men to Dream that all things will continue <HI>Long unaltered</HI> from what they are at this <HI>Time:</HI> Let me tell you, This. <HI>Dream</HI> is usually a very dead∣ly Symptom. When Men are most <HI>Secure,</HI> and are Fearless of any <HI>Alteration</HI> upon their Circum∣stances; Then 'tis, that the Deadliest <HI>Alterations</HI> are most near unto them. An Old Man brags, he is as <HI>Well</HI> and <HI>Strong</HI> as he has been these <HI>Many Years;</HI> he hopes he shall yet see <HI>Many Years.</HI> He Dies <HI>this Year!</HI> Oh! Don't fall into a Dead Sleep of <HI>Security.</HI> 'Tis a tremendous
<PB N="17" REF="002913_0019_0FE694F597953370"/>passage; [And mark what I tell you, There are whole <HI>Nations</HI> that will VERY QUICKLY have it fulfill'd upon them!] 1 Thes. V. 3. <HI>When they say, peace and safety, then sudden de∣struction cometh.</HI> When and How is a <HI>Belshazzar</HI> taken off? Instead of a Foolish <HI>Security</HI> be ever∣more <HI>Suspicious,</HI> and still Suspect what may happen between the <HI>Cup</HI> and the <HI>Lip,</HI> and with an easy Frame of Mind Leave all in the Hand of a Glorious GOD ready to take any <HI>Cup</HI> that He shall order for you. Say with an easy Mind; <HI>I know not my Time; and I am content that I do not know it. But, O my God, I know in my Time nothing will befall me, but what thou orderest, and I chearfully refer all to thy ordering!</HI> But I will go on, and charge this Folly upon all that presume on the <HI>Time to come.</HI> While <HI>Man knoweth not his Time,</HI> thou mayst O Man <HI>know</HI> so much of thy <HI>Time,</HI> That the <HI>Present Time</HI> is thy <HI>only Time.</HI> All <HI>Thy Time,</HI> is <HI>This Time.</HI> Do not Rely upon a <HI>To-Morrow,</HI> or upon, <HI>A more convenient Season,</HI> for any thing that thou art now to do for the Good of Thy self or Others O <HI>Do with thy might, what thy Hand find to do.</HI> For <HI>know</HI> this; Thou <HI>knowest</HI> of no other <HI>Time</HI> for the doing of it.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> WHAT now remains, but this Word of Command, <HI>Make all Ready!</HI> Oh! Let us <HI>make Ready</HI> for whatever <HI>Times</HI> are to pass over us.</P>
<P><HI>MAKE Ready</HI> for <HI>Changes</HI> of Every Sort. This do by getting into that posture of Mind, which is described so, Psal. CXII. 7. <HI>He shall
<PB N="18" REF="002913_0020_0FE694C12161AF50"/>not be afraid of evil tidings; His Heart is fixed, trusting in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>BUT above all, <HI>Make Ready</HI> for that Greatest and Sureft of all our <HI>Changes;</HI> The DEATH of which I may say, <HI>The Day is Near, it is near, and it hastneth greatly!</HI> Indeed, for the animation of all PIETY, this Meditation, <HI>Man knows not his Time;</HI> Tis an Instrument of which I may say, <HI>There is none like it.</HI> How would it come like a <HI>Red-hot Stone</HI> from the <HI>Altar,</HI> to enflame our Devotions, if when we are going to <HI>Prayer,</HI> we should think, <HI>I know not my Time: This may be the last Time that ever I shall call upon GOD, before I am fetch'd away to appear before Him!</HI> What <HI>Salt</HI> would it season our <HI>Speech</HI> withal, if in our Conversation with our Friends we should think, <HI>I know not my Time: This may be the last Time of my Conversing with such as I am now talk∣ing to!</HI> At what a rate should we <HI>Sabbatize,</HI> if upon the Arrival of the <HI>Lords-Day,</HI> we should think, <HI>I know not my Time: This may be the last Lords Day that I shall see before my Dying Day!</HI> But the Grand concern of PIETY, is in that, <HI>Be Ye Ready.</HI> And, My Friends, That you may be <HI>Ready</HI> for the <HI>Death,</HI> whereof you do <HI>not know the Time,</HI> you <HI>do know,</HI> That you must be∣gin Immediately to <HI>Live unto GOD.</HI> Your Immediate CONVERSION to GOD, This you do <HI>know,</HI> is absolutely Necessary; And your coming into His <HI>Covenant,</HI> by consenting that your Great SAVIOUR should fulfill for you and in you the <HI>Good pleasure of His Goodness.</HI> By this you make sure of <HI>Grace,</HI> and of <HI>Glory,</HI> and
<PB N="19" REF="002913_0021_0FE694F5B2D71F18"/>of Every <HI>Good Thing:</HI> and you <HI>lay hold on Eter∣nal Life.</HI> This you do <HI>know,</HI> That without this, you have the <HI>Wrath of GOD abiding on you;</HI> If you Dy without this, you <HI>Dy in your Sins;</HI> and you pass into a World which cannot be without a Shuddering Horror tho't upon! People refuse to <HI>Turn</HI> to GOD, and <HI>Close</HI> with CHRIST, and <HI>Fly</HI> from SIN. They do it by <HI>Procrastinating;</HI> By putting off to <HI>Another Time.</HI> O the Phrensy of this <HI>Procrastination!</HI> Unadvised People, You <HI>know not your time.</HI> And therefore <HI>This</HI> you <HI>know;</HI> This Work must not be left undone untill <HI>Another Time.</HI> If your <HI>Time</HI> should be done, before that <HI>Work</HI> be done, which must be done that you may be Reconciled unto GOD, O Mi∣serable Ones, you <HI>Perish Wonderfully!</HI> O Miser∣able Ones, you fall into hands, which it is <HI>a fear∣ful Thing to fall into!</HI></P>
<P>THERE once came unto an unhappy Man, that Message, Jer. XXVIII. 16. <HI>This Year thou shalt Dy.</HI> Man, Thou <HI>knowest not thy Time;</HI> And therefore the Message may be brought unto thee, <HI>This Year thou mayst Dy.</HI> But what if the <HI>Dead Warrant</HI> could be more evidently shown thee, O Thou <HI>Prisoner of the Earth:</HI> And it could be more positively said, <HI>This Year thou shalt Dy?</HI> Wouldest thou not Immediately Retire to <HI>Consider thy ways;</HI> Immediately plead the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST for the Salvation of thy Soul, the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST, for thy Acceptance with GOD; Immediately give up thy self unto the Holy SPIRIT of the Lord, and with a most flaming Agony entreat Him to
<PB N="20" REF="002913_0022_0FE694C28B3B5DC0"/>take <HI>Possession</HI> of thee! Oh! then do this Imme∣diately, <HI>O all ye People every one of you!</HI> For, O Man, Thou <HI>knowest not thy Time.</HI> There is not one of us, but for ought he knows, he may <HI>Dy</HI> before this <HI>Week</HI> be out: Man, For ought thou <HI>knowest, This Night thy Soul may be required of thee!</HI></P>
<P>BUT, my Friends, If your <HI>Time,</HI> when it comes find you unprepared, and <HI>alienated from the Life of GOD,</HI> what a Lamentable Condition do you fall into! what amazing Lamentations are you thrown into! The doleful Cry, <HI>Lord, Lord, Open to us!</HI> what will it avail. Twill be <HI>All too Late! All too Late!</HI> But the Horror of such a Confusion, O consider of it before it be <HI>too late.</HI></P>
<P>YEA, Consider me as now coming to you with a <HI>Message from the Dead,</HI> and a <HI>Message</HI> directed more peculiarly and pathetically to the YOUNG PEOPLE among us; and a <HI>Message</HI> which brings with it a Demand of EARLY PIETY, and their Immediate Conversion to GOD, and Espousal to their SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>AN <HI>Early Death,</HI> and a very <HI>Sudden</HI> One too, should never occur, without our Apprehending a <HI>Voice</HI> of the Glorious GOD unto the Survivers in it. Yea, <HI>The Voice of the Lord Cries to the City,</HI> and very particularly to the YOUNG PEOPLE of the City; The Children of <HI>Wisdom</HI> will hearken unto it, and with awakened Souls Lift up their Cries to Heaven upon it; <HI>Oh! That before I am cut down, I may bring forth some Fruit unto GOD!</HI></P>
<PB N="21" REF="002913_0023_0FE694F98A409688"/>
<P>THE famous <HI>Waldo,</HI> whose Name has been so considerable among the <HI>Waldensian Witnesses</HI> of our Lord, was brought home to GOD, and made a Prayerful, Watchful, Fruitful Walker with GOD all the rest of his Days, upon his beholding a Young Friend of his fall down <HI>Suddenly Dead</HI> before him. And what? Shall never any more, come to <HI>Think on</HI> their <HI>Ways,</HI> and <HI>make haste</HI> into a <HI>Walk with GOD,</HI> upon such an awakening Spectacle!</P>
<P>THO' the <HI>Child Samuel,</HI> were a very Religi∣ous Child, and a bright Exemple of EARLY PIETY, we find, that no less than Three times over, the most Holy GOD, from the <HI>Holy of Ho∣lies,</HI> call'd unto him, and he was not aware whose <HI>Voice</HI> it was; he was not sensible that there was the <HI>Voice</HI> of GOD in the call. Alas, 'Tis an Error whereto we are all too often liable; and the less of EARLY PIETY there is in <HI>Young People,</HI> the more liable they are unto it. <HI>Children,</HI> There is a <HI>Voice</HI> to you, in what you have seen; and a <HI>Voice</HI> as much directed unto you, as if you were like <HI>Samuel,</HI> by Name called upon: and it is a <HI>Voice</HI> wherein your EARLY PIETY is very audibly &amp; awfully called for. But are you a∣ware, whose <HI>Voice</HI> it is? 'Tis the <HI>Voice</HI> of the most Glorious GOD, and of a SAVIOUR <HI>wait∣ing that He may be Gracious</HI> to you. Oh! Listen to the <HI>Voice,</HI> Answer to the <HI>Voice;</HI> and say, <HI>Lord, Speak, for thy Servant hears; and I will be thy Servant: I am Ready to comply with thy whole will in all hearty Obedience!</HI> But what, Oh! what is the <HI>Voice,</HI> to be thus hearkened to! The <HI>Voice</HI> is, <Q>Oh! <HI>Immediately</HI> go thro' the <HI>Process
<PB N="22" REF="002913_0024_0FE694C2CBD59A20"/>of Repentance,</HI> which the <HI>Life of thy Soul</HI> depends upon! The <HI>Voice</HI> is; Oh! <HI>Immediately</HI> by coming into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD get thy <HI>Soul bound up in the Bundle of Life!</HI> The <HI>Voice</HI> is, 'Oh! <HI>Im∣mediately Deny all Ungodliness &amp; Worldly Lusts,</HI> and come into the <HI>Resolutions</HI> of a <HI>Godly</HI> and a <HI>Sober</HI> and a <HI>Righteous Life!</HI> Thou <HI>knowest not</HI> how soon thy <HI>Time</HI> to do these <HI>Necessary Things</HI> may be over with thee.</Q></P>
<P>NO doubt, There are many <HI>Young People</HI> a∣mong us, who have some <HI>Convictions</HI> on their Minds, That things are not with them, as they <HI>should be;</HI> and they must no longer continue as they are : Nor are they without some feeble <HI>Pur∣poses, I will not offend any more. Children,</HI> Beware lest you Sin away these <HI>Convictions,</HI> and a Penal <HI>Blindness</HI> and <HI>Hardness</HI> be what you shall there∣upon be for ever left unto. We read concerning <HI>Sampson,</HI> That while he was yet in his <HI>Youth,</HI> perhaps a very <HI>Young</HI> Lad; Judg. XIII. 25. <HI>The Spirit of the Lord began to move him at times.</HI> Thus, there are many <HI>Young People,</HI> who feel the <HI>Spirit of the Lord beginning to move them at times;</HI> and they feel Pious <HI>Motions</HI> in their Hearts; They think, They will shake off their <HI>Vain Company;</HI> They will take up the <HI>Religion of the Closet;</HI> They will prepare for, and approach to, the <HI>Holy Table.</HI> But, Oh! Don't lose these <HI>Motions;</HI> and let not the <HI>Spirit of the Lord</HI> be provoked by your contempt of His <HI>Motions</HI> to <HI>Depart</HI> from you. <HI>Wo to them, when I depart from them, saith the Lord!</HI> It was among the Dying words, which the late Eminent Professor of Theology in the University of St.
<PB N="23" REF="002913_0025_0FE694F9A5FCEE08"/><HI>Andrews,</HI> in <HI>Scotland,</HI> used unto one of his Children; <HI>You seem some-times to have Convictions; Beware how you treat them. They are the most dangerous things that ever you meddled with.<NOTE PLACE="marg">[<HI>Mr.</HI> Hald∣burton.]</NOTE> Each of them is a Messenger of GOD. If you seek not GOD, and if you despise the Messenger of GOD, He will be terribly avenged on you.</HI></P>
<P>IN the <HI>Firmament</HI> of the Sacred Scriptures, what a Terrible Thunderclap is That! Prov I. 28. <HI>They shall seek me Early, and they shall not find me!</HI> Our Blessed REDEEMER, who is <HI>the Wisdom of GOD,</HI> says, <HI>They that seek me Early shall find me.</HI> How and why is it then said, <HI>They shall seek me Early, and they shall not find me!</HI> There is a sad Solution of it. There is the SAVIOUS <HI>Early;</HI> and there is, the SINNERS <HI>Early.</HI> The proposal of the SAVIOUR is, <HI>To Day if thou wilt hear my Voice. Yea, Assoon as thou dost hear of me, obey me, and submit unto me. Betimes, Quickly, Pre∣sently, without any Delay, make a surrender of thy self and thy All unto me.</HI> But now, the SINNER puts off his cares to <HI>get into the Righteousness</HI> of GOD, until all his <HI>Youth</HI> have been spent in the <HI>way of his own heart,</HI> and <HI>Satan</HI> his had his <HI>Mar∣row,</HI> and he begins to feel <HI>Destruction coming as a Whirlwind</HI> upon him. <HI>Then</HI> he thinks 'tis <HI>Early</HI> enough to become a <HI>Seeker</HI> of GOD. This, This is the EARLY, which <HI>Mercy</HI> is denied unto. This the <HI>Early,</HI> which the Abused <HI>Patience</HI> of GOD will not permit the <HI>Sinner</HI> to find <HI>Mercy</HI> in! You know the consequence. Oh! <HI>Be per∣swaded, knewing the Terror of the Lord.</HI></P>
<PB N="24" REF="002913_0026_0FE694CB9BE7A188"/>
<P>BUT I leave the work in the hands of another <HI>Preacher,</HI> and a flaming one. 'Tis a <HI>Preacher</HI> that will go home with you; and there I intreat you <HI>to Hearken unto him, that GOD may hearken unto you another Day.</HI> Let <HI>Conscience</HI> now do its office. I refer the whole Issue to the <HI>Conscience</HI> of the Hearer; and I beseech you, that you would in a due Retirement this very Evening, hear what your <HI>Consciences</HI> will speak upon this point; <HI>What should be done by One who does not know his Time, nor know whether he shall have one Day more, to do what he has to do, that he may be Happy to all ETERNITY.</HI></P>
