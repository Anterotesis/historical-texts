<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Candid Reader,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE Reason of my chusing the <HI>Subject</HI> of the following Sermon, in the Course of my stated Ministrations to my own Congregation, was the sorrowful Apprehension I had of the low State of <HI>vital Religion,</HI> in general among us, at this Time; and a sincere Desire to excite truly pious Persons, to more Earnestness and Diligence in the Service of God: I had not the least Thought of its Publication when it was preached; but being since Earnestly de∣sired to commit it to the <HI>Press,</HI> I have consented, ho∣ping and praying, that it may thro' the divine Blessing, be of some Use to Mankind: The Sovereign God sends by whom he will send, he can, and has in many In∣stances, blessed weak Means; if we sincerely endea∣vour as well as we can to promote his Kingdom, he will graciously accept of our humble Endeavours, and probably bless them to some; both which Considerations are great Incentives to Action: To prevent <HI>Prolixi∣ty,</HI>
<PB REF="008745_0003_102FD85D74DD0908"/>
I have not expressed in the <HI>Sermon,</HI> the Words of many Places of sacred Scripture, which confirm and illustrate the Matters treated of: I would there∣fore intreat the <HI>Reader,</HI> to turn to them for his own Satisfaction and Benefit; and I earnestly beg his Prayers, for one who is less than the least of all Saints, that I may obtain Mercy, to be faithful to the Death:</P>

<P><HI>LIGHT</HI> and <HI>Heat</HI> are inseparable Compa∣nions in true <HI>Religion,</HI> without the latter, the former is cold <HI>Formality;</HI> and without the former, the latter is wild <HI>Enthusiasm:</HI> Tho' the Passions be bad Guides, they are notwithstand∣ing good Servants, and therefore should neither
<PB N="6" REF="008745_0005_102FD851E6A54B98"/>
be neglected nor destroyed, but excited, and duly regulated in their Tendencies, by Reason and Revelation, according to the Nature and Impor∣tance of their Objects: This is the <HI>Remedy</HI> which the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> proposes in the Words of our Text, to the <HI>lukewarm Church</HI> of <HI>Laodicea,</HI> to cure her <HI>Degeneracy,</HI> and remove the <HI>Calamities</HI> conse∣quent upon it; which are supposed by the pre∣ceeding Part of the Verse, from which the <HI>Text</HI> is an Inference: <HI>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten; be</HI> ZEALOUS <HI>therefore and repent. q. d.</HI> Seeing the Afflictions I send to correct you for, and reclaim you from your Remissness in Religion, proceed not from Prejudice, but regard to your best Good, therefore they should be kindly accep∣ted and faithfully improved, by the exercise of <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Penitence;</HI> without which they will not be removed in Mercy: Certainly, <HI>the Wounds of a Friend, are better than the Kisses of an Enemy;</HI> if therefore you have any gratitude to God, or re∣gard to your own Interest, <HI>Be ZEALOUS! Ardent Love</HI> is termed <HI>ZEAL, (Num.</HI> xi. 29. <HI>Psalm</HI> lxix. 9.) By this Word, our Lord enjoins a laudable Emulation of Piety and Virtue, and an ardent strong Affection in religious Worship: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Camero vid. Pol. Synop. in Loc: Zelos, ex Zeo, lian, valde ferveo, Pasor.</NOTE>
<PB N="7" REF="008745_0006_102FD85FA25FCE00"/>
<HI>Be ZEALOUS,</HI> shake off your Sloth and Luke∣warmness, and Labour earnestly in the Use of all appointed Means to recover your first Love, your former Warmth, Spirit, and Savour; that so you may be such <HI>burning</HI> and <HI>shining Lights,</HI> such <HI>sa∣vory Salt,</HI> in a dark and degenerate World, <HI>that Men seeing your good Works, may glorify your Father which is in Heaven: If the Salt looses its Savour,</HI> our Lord assures us, <HI>it is good for Nothing, but to be cast out, and troden under the Feet of Men! (Matth.</HI> v. 13.)—<HI>And repent: i. e.</HI> Candidly confess, and sincerely lament your Coldness and Negligence in Time past, and resolve in the Strength of God to do better in Time to come, in Pursuance of which, strive to keep yourselves in the Love of God, strive to keep alive in your Souls the sacred Fire of divine Grace, that ye may not be dead while ye live, but live in Love, live to God, and feel you live! let your Spikenard incessantly diffuse to all around you, its aromatic, delightful, and useful Fragrance, and your Hearts glow with unremit∣ting▪ pious, and noble Ardors!</P>
<P>THE Subject of our present Meditations is ZEAL, which is twofold, <HI>viz.</HI> bad and good: Of the former <HI>Genus</HI> or Sort, there are various Kinds or <HI>Species,</HI> particularly</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="8" REF="008745_0007_102FD854C0083D60"/>1. THERE is a <HI>natural Zeal</HI> and Activity▪ unsanc∣tified, which is the Effect of a sprightly <HI>Tempera∣ture</HI> of Body; which, tho' it be not positively Evil, yet has Nothing spiritual or saving in it, and so is comparatively Bad.</P>
<P N="2">2. AN <HI>ignorant Zeal,</HI> when Persons are zealous and they dont know for what or why; and hence it is said of the carnal <HI>Jews,</HI> that <HI>they had a Zeal for God, but not according to Knowledge, for being ignorant of Gods Righteousness,</HI> or of the Necessity and Sufficiency of the Righteousness of a Mediator, to the Justification of a believing Sinner, which is of Gods Appointment; <HI>and going about to establish their own</HI> in Place thereof, <HI>they did not</HI> sincerely <HI>submit to,</HI> or entirely depend upon, <HI>the Righteous∣ness of God, (Romans</HI> x. 2, 3.) And <HI>thus</HI> Israel <HI>that followed after the Law of Righteousness, hath not attained to the Law of Righteousness. Where∣fore? Because they sought it not by Faith, but as it were by the Works of the Law, (Romans</HI> ix. 31, 32.) But besides this <HI>Self-righteous Vein,</HI> ignorant <HI>Zeal</HI> is equally liable to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> into the wilds and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reaks of <HI>Enthusiasm;</HI> when Men leave the Guidance of the holy Scriptures, and follow the blind <HI>Impulses</HI> of their own Minds, which they reckon sufficient without them; contrary to the sacred Oracles,
<PB N="9" REF="008745_0008_102FD861DB378780"/>
(1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 14. <HI>Rev.</HI> iii. 17. <HI>Luke</HI> xi. 13.) Ig∣norant Zeal is exceeding Dangerous, like a <HI>Sword</HI> in the Hand of one that is blind, or mad! Wit∣ness the <HI>Boors</HI> Wars in <HI>Germany;</HI> and many other Instances nearer Home.</P>
<P N="3">3. A <HI>hypocritical Zeal,</HI> when Men affect to ap∣pear zealous before others, when they are not so in Reality; thus the <HI>Pharisees</HI> wore broad <HI>Phylac∣tery's,</HI> made long <HI>Prayers,</HI> compassed Sea and Land to make a <HI>Proselyte,</HI> gave <HI>Alms</HI> in public, built the <HI>Tombs</HI> of the <HI>Prophets,</HI> that they might be seen of Men, and esteemed Religious; and yet they <HI>persecuted</HI> at the same Time, the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Prophets.</HI> Those Hypocrites our Lord accosts in the following Language, <HI>Ye Serpents, ye Genera∣tion of Vipers, how can ye escape the Damnation of Hell, (Matthew</HI> xxiii. Chapter.)</P>
<P N="4">4. A <HI>proud Zeal,</HI> when Men are <HI>fervent</HI> in any Matter that concerns them, their Opinions, Hu∣mors, Honors, Interests, Friends, or any Thing that is theirs, and principly because it is theirs: And yet such is the Deceitfulness of the human Heart, that some are pleased with this sorry <HI>Mush∣room</HI> Witness <HI>Jehu,</HI> who had the Confidence to ask good <HI>Jonabab, to come and see his Zeal.</HI> (2 <HI>Kings</HI> x, 16.)</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="10" REF="008745_0009_102FD8564C347F18"/>5. A <HI>factious Zeal,</HI> when <HI>Pride</HI> or <HI>Covetousness</HI> hath engaged Men in a <HI>Party,</HI> and they think it their Duty, at least their Interest, to contend ear∣nestly for all the Opinions and Customs of the <HI>Sect</HI> they have chosen, without examining whe∣ther they be right or wrong: In the mean Time slighting and rejecting all who are of other Deno∣minations, and Sentiments in lesser Things; and solicitously labouring to proselyte others, rather to a Party than to vital Piety, that they may <HI>glory in their Flesh,</HI> and answer some mean Design, (<HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 13.) As if it was a great Catch to be damned, rather in this, than in that <HI>Faction;</HI> but blessed be God, the Church of Christ is not confined to any Party, (<HI>John</HI> x 16.) Nor does the <HI>Kingdom</HI> of God consist in <HI>Meats</HI> and <HI>Drinks, but in Peace and Righteousness, and Joy in the holy Ghost, (Rom.</HI> xiv. 17.) The Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> expressed his Abhor∣rence of promoting <HI>Schisms</HI> in the Church of God, by a noble Depression of himself on that Occasion, <HI>who then is</HI> Paul, <HI>and who is</HI> Apollos? (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> iii. 5.) The main Point is to be <HI>holy</HI> in Heart and Life, such will surely get to Heaven, and there their Differences in Sentiment will be comfortably set∣tled.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="11" REF="008745_0010_102FD85885FFD3E0"/>6. A <HI>superstitious Zeal,</HI> for small and indifferent Things while greater are neglected, thus the <HI>Pha∣risees</HI> were fond of their <HI>Washings</HI> and <HI>Traditions,</HI> and <HI>paid Tithes</HI> of <HI>Mint, Anise,</HI> and <HI>Cummin,</HI> while they <HI>omitted the weightier Matters of the Law, Judgment, Mercy, and Faith.</HI> They <HI>strained at a Gnat, and swallowed a Camel, (Matthew</HI> xxiii. 24.)</P>
<P N="7">7. AN <HI>envious Zeal,</HI> against those that have the Precedency and cross their Desires, contradict their Notions, or cloud their Honor: <HI>But if ye have bitter Envying and Strife in your Hearts, glory not, and lie not against the Truth: This Wisdom de∣scendeth not from above, but is earthly sensual, and devilish. (James</HI> iii. 14, 15.)</P>
<P N="8">8. A <HI>malignant Zeal,</HI> against the faithful Ser∣vants of Christ, for their Soundness, Holiness, and Usefulness, and in Proportion thereto: Not∣withstanding all the plausible Pretexts with which it is artfully covered, (<HI>See this shocking</HI> PARADOX <HI>confirmed by divine Testimony: Gen.</HI> iii. 15. <HI>Gal.</HI> iv. 29. <HI>Luke</HI> xii. 51, 52, 53. 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 12. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xvi. 9. <HI>Rev.</HI> xii. 12, 13.)</P>
<P>As sinful <HI>ZEAL</HI> is manifold in Kind, so it is exceeding hainous and of malignant Influence; it dishonoreth God by presuming to affix his sacred Name to Error in Principle, and Impiety in Prac∣tice;
<PB N="12" REF="008745_0011_102FD86369DB2DF0"/>
it charges upon infinite Purity all the Wic∣kedness it commits; it injures the Church of God, as well as civil Society and our own Souls; this made <HI>Paul</HI> exceeding <HI>mad</HI> against the Disciples of Christ, so that he shut them up in Prisons and compelled them to blaspheme! (<HI>Acts</HI> xxvi. 10, 11.) This breeds Contention, and oversets the Peace and Order of Societies and Families: As pious <HI>Zeal</HI> is the Fervency of Grace, so is sin∣ful <HI>Zeal</HI> the Fervency of Sin, it makes Men dou∣bly sinful, for hereby they are induced to do much Evil in a little Time, and that in the Name of God, whereby they fight against him by his own Authority: (Perverted) this blinds Men's Minds, and prejudices their Hearts against Conviction; the zealous Sinner justifies his Sin, and pleads Scrip∣ture and Reason in its Defence: Yea, he thinks he is serving God, when he is <HI>murdering</HI> his Servants, and opposing the <HI>Power</HI> and Spirit of Religion, a melancholy Case this indeed! Yea, even <HI>Zeal</HI> for small and circumstantial Matters, when high in Degree, is of hurtful Tendency, for it destroyeth Charity and Peace, and disparages holy Zeal by Accident, making the profane think that all Zeal is no better than the foolish Passions of deceived Men; and hence it disables those that have it to do Good, even when they are zealous for important Truth and Duty, for many will be inclined to
<PB N="13" REF="008745_0012_102FD864F4241D30"/>
think it of the same Nature with their eronious Zeal, and so disregard them. Now seeing the Case of sinful Zeal is so awful and dangerous, it should put us all upon our guard, lest we be de∣ceived and ensnared by Satan and our own Hearts!</P>
<P>BUT the PIOUS <HI>ZEAL</HI> enjoined in our Text, is of a very different Kind, and may be thus de∣scribed, <HI>viz.</HI> that it is <HI>a devout Fervour or Warmth, wrought in the Affections of a regenerated Person by the holy Spirit, in the Use of appointed Means, whereby they are carried out to the utmost, in promoting the Kingdom of God, from Love to his Majesty, with an Eye to his Glory, and according to the Directions of his written Word, (Romans</HI> xii. 11. <HI>James</HI> v. 16. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> i. 22 and 48.)</P>
<P>HERE observe, that <HI>love</HI> to God, is the <HI>Principle</HI> from which this pious Passion proceeds, (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 14.) His <HI>Glory</HI> is its <HI>End,</HI> (1 <HI>Cor.</HI> x. 31.) His <HI>Word</HI> is the <HI>Rule</HI> by which it is regulated, (<HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 16.) His <HI>Spirit</HI> its <HI>Efficient, (Rom.</HI> viii. 9.) And <HI>Regeneration</HI> its <HI>Antecedent, (Colossi.</HI> iii. 1, 2.) It is not a distinct Grace by itself, but the <HI>Vigor</HI> and fervent Operation of every <HI>Grace;</HI> and has the following <HI>Properties, viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="008745_0013_102FD86AE021C0F8"/>1. IT is <HI>according to Knowledge, (Rom.</HI> x. 2.) for Truth and Holiness, and not for Error and Sin: It is such as a Man can give a Reason for, and so is a <HI>reasonable Service, (Rom.</HI> xii. 1.) Without Knowledge the Mind cannot be good, (<HI>Prov.</HI> xiii. 2.) The popish and enthusiastical Notion therefore, that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion, is as false as it is foolish and pernicious, a reproach to Christianity, yea, a scandal to human Nature!</P>
<P N="2">2. SINCERE and simple, for God and his King∣dom, without mean Artifice and selfish Design. (2 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 12.) <HI>For our rejoicing is this, even the Testimony of our Conscience, that in Simplicity and godly Sincerity, not with fleshly Wisdom, but by the Grace of God, we have had our Conversation in the World. For we are not as many, who corrupt</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Capelusantes, adulterating it, as Hucksters who for the sake of Gain, unjustly mix Water with the Wine they sell. <HI>Vid. Pasor. Pools Synop.</HI> See 2 <HI>Corinth.</HI> iv. 2.</NOTE>
<HI>the Word of God, but as of Sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God, speak we in Christ,</HI> (2 <HI>Corin.</HI> ii. 17.)</P>
<P N="3">3. TEMPERED with <HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and attended with <HI>Meekness, Self-denial</HI> and <HI>Patience:</HI> True Zeal makes the Saints <HI>humble,</HI> Witness the <HI>Publican</HI> and Apostle <HI>Paul, (Luke</HI> xviii. 13. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 15. <HI>Philip.</HI> iii, 8.) But while they think
<PB N="15" REF="008745_0014_102FD867C7C5FD80"/>
meanly of themselves, they highly esteem others, and give them all that Honor that is due to their several Places and Relations, (<HI>Rom.</HI> xiii. 7.) And while their Indignation burns against the Sins of Men because of the dishonor done thereby to God; they feel Bowels of Pity towards their Persons! (<HI>Rev.</HI> ii. 2. <HI>Col.</HI> iii. 12.) When <HI>Moses</HI> tho' the meekest of Men, saw the Calf which the People of <HI>Israel</HI> had made, and Dancing, his Anger wax∣ed hot, and he broke the Tables of Stone, (<HI>Ezod.</HI> xxxii. 19.) Yet he earnestly plead for Mercy to∣wards their Persons, (<HI>Exod.</HI> xxxiii. 19.) Thus our dear Lord looked on ungrateful Impenitents with <HI>Anger,</HI> who sought to flay their kindest Be∣nefactor; being <HI>grieved for the Hardness of their Hearts, (Mark</HI> iii. 5.) And hence we may learn that true <HI>Zeal</HI> is a compound of <HI>Anger</HI> and <HI>Grief,</HI> both which proceed from <HI>love</HI> to God and Man, and therefore is inconsistent with Barbarity and Blood! (<HI>See Gal.</HI> iv. 12. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xii. 21. <HI>Luke</HI> ix. 53 to 57▪) <HI>Wilt then that we command Fire to come down from Heaven, and consume them? But he turn∣ed and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what Manner of Spirit ye are of: For the Son of Man is not come to destroy Men's lives, but to save them.</HI> See how contrary Christ is to <HI>Dragooning</HI> for <HI>Religion,</HI> and spreading his <HI>spiritual Kingdom</HI> by the carnal Weapons of <HI>Sword</HI> and <HI>Terge:</HI> A Method which
<PB N="16" REF="008745_0015_102FD86C72787C88"/>
some fierce Bigots would fain tamper with, to spread the <HI>Shibboleths</HI> of their Schisms! If <HI>Club-law</HI> be the proper Method to convince Mens Understandings and propagate the Faith; then the <HI>Spanish Inquisition</HI> is the Perfection of Christianity; the most worthy and pious Discovery that has yet been made. O horrible! is it decent or con∣sistent for Protestants, who confess they are fal∣lible; assert the Necessity of Knowledge, and the right of private Judgement, and who blame the Papists for their cruelty and bloodshed, to imi∣tate the Mother of Harlots in her Wickedness, by propagating her slavish and bloody Tenets; for if external Force be necessary to promote Religion, it will necessarily follow, that eronious Decrees have a binding Power; that implicit Faith is sound Doctrine; that Knowledge is dangerous, and Ig∣norance the Mother of Devotion; because the less we know, the more easily we can submit blind-sold to an absolute Authority: But when any do so in Matters purely Religious, they ad∣mit and obey another <HI>King</HI> in Christ's Kingdom, and so commence <HI>Rebels</HI> against his supreme Au∣thority, who is the only Lord, Lawgiver, and Master of his People; by prefering others before him, and setting up their Authority in Opposition to his, (<HI>James</HI> iv. 12▪ <HI>Matthew</HI> xxiii. 10.)</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="008745_0016_102FD86E03C88950"/>LEARNED Mr. <HI>Warburton</HI> on this Subject, just∣ly observes, <Q>That it hath been offered in excuse for this Behaviour of the Protestant Churches, on their Separation from the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> (for their Perseverance in it afterwards, will admit of no Apology,) that the Spirit of Per∣secution hath a marvelous Malignity in its Na∣ture, above all other Errors, to corrupt and deprave the human Mind: So that when every other Iniquity of papal Power had been now detected and expelled; this still sculked behind, within the close Recesses of the Heart; and as often as it could disguise its Deformity under a Zeal for the Work of <HI>Reformation,</HI> it was ready to step out and play the Devil!</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. PROPORTIONED in <HI>Degree</HI> to the Weight and <HI>Moment</HI> of Things, more careful about the Substance than the Circumstance; and prefering great Things to small; <HI>Righteousness</HI> and <HI>Peace</HI> to <HI>Meats</HI> and <HI>Drinks;</HI> the <HI>weightier Things of the Law,</HI> to <HI>Mint;</HI> and a <HI>Camel</HI> to a <HI>Gnat, (Mat.</HI> ix. 13. <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 17 and 20. <HI>Mat.</HI> xxiii. 23, 24.) Prefering Things plain and self-evident, to Things comparatively doubtful and problematical, (<HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 5 and 17, 18.) Prefering Matters that con∣cern vital and practical Holiness, to uncertain Opi∣pinions about what is remote from the Heart and
<PB N="18" REF="008745_0017_102FD87031143D50"/>
Practice of Piety; such as foolish and unlearned Questions, which gender Strife, Genealogies, and Contentions about the Law, which are unprofita∣ble and vain, (<HI>Titus</HI> iii. 8, 9. 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 23.) And striving about Words to no Profit, but to the Sub∣version of the Hearers, (2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 14.) True Zeal contendeth not for small and doubtful Con∣troversies, to the loss or wrong of greater Truths and Duties, tho' it regards every Truth; yet in a Degree proportioned to its Place and Weight in the Christian <HI>System,</HI> or <HI>Analogy</HI> of <HI>Faith, (Rom.</HI> xii. 6.) It is hottest in the greatest Things, and coolest in the least; more earnest for a vital <HI>Faith, Love,</HI> and <HI>good Works,</HI> than for doubtful <HI>Opinions,</HI> and mutable <HI>Ceremonies;</HI> more earnest for the Foundation, than for some small Apendages in the Superstructure; more earnest for the <HI>Life</HI> and Soul of <HI>Religion,</HI> than its Garb and <HI>Dress, (Col.</HI> ii. 19. and iii. 14. <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 14.) Nor can any Thing be more reasonable, for Love is the fulfilling of the Law, and Faith and Holiness the Substance and Scope of the Gospel, (<HI>Rom.</HI> xiii. 10. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 5. <HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 15, 16.) <Q>Carnal contests about little Things, while the great are neglected; seem to express great Solicitude; how most neatly to adorn a <HI>Carcase,</HI> or at best, how with greatest Art and Curiosity, to Trim and Appa∣rel gorgeously, a languishing Man, in the fear∣ed

<P>THINGS comparatively small, such as <HI>Mint, Anise</HI> and <HI>Cummin,</HI> ought to be regarded according to their <HI>Moment,</HI> and observed in their proper Or∣der, but not put on a <HI>Par</HI> with the <HI>weightier</HI> Matters of the Law: And regarded they may be by us, as to our own Persuasion and Practice; and modestly and peaceably recommended to o∣thers by Reason and Argument, without impos∣ing them as Terms of Communion on others; a <HI>Claim</HI> we have no Authority for, from the King of the Church, (<HI>See Rom.</HI> xiv. throughout, and xv. 1 and 7. <HI>Ephes.</HI> iv. 2.)

or <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>external Worship,</HI> must give Place to brotherly Love and Compassion: To say that there is no Difference in respect of the Degrees of Importance, in different Truths and Duties, is to oppose the plainest Dictates of Reason, as well as the positive Declarations of Christ and his Apostles; and to say that these should not be regarded accor∣dingly, is to be guilty of the Iniquity which our Lord reproved in his Enemies, the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> and to reject common Sense! To regard a Nail in the Roof of a House, as much as a Stone in the Foun∣dation; or, the Hair of a Man's Head and his Nails, as much as his Heart and Lungs, is redi∣culous and absurd!</P>
<P N="5">5. TRUE <HI>Zeal</HI> is ever tender of the Churches <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Unity,</HI> and therefore avoids with Care, irregular Measures and Impositions which tend to Confusion and Division: <HI>The Wisdom that is from above, is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated; full of Mercy and good Fruits, with∣out Partiality, and without Hypocrisy, (James</HI> iii. 17.) The <HI>Union</HI> of Christs <HI>Body</HI> mistical is her Strength and Comfort, her Beauty and Glory; this makes her the Delight of her Friends, and the Terror of her Enemies. In this Situation,

<HI>how goodly are thy Tents, O</HI> Jacob, <HI>and thy Taber∣nacles, O</HI> Israel? <HI>Who is she that looketh forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun, and terrible as an Army with Banners? (Cant.</HI> vi. 10.) <HI>Christ prays that his People may be one, that the World may know the Father had sent him, (John</HI> xvii. 21.) And shall not we <HI>labour to keep the Unity of the Spirit, in the Bond of Peace, (Ephes.</HI> iv. 3.) Labour to be one in Affection and Design, as Christ and the Father are one: And as far as we have attained, be one in Conduct, (<HI>Philip.</HI> iii. 16.) Labour to be one in <HI>fundamentals,</HI> and as to <HI>lesser Points</HI> exercise <HI>Forbearance,</HI> allowing that <HI>Liberty</HI> to others, which our great Master has left to all, and which ourselves desire; and the Weak∣ness of our present State, renders so Necessary to our Comfort and Benefit, (<HI>Tit.</HI> iii. 10. <HI>Ephes.</HI> iv. 2. <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 1. <HI>Gal.</HI> v. 1.)

Enemies! Would she embrace and act up to this equitable Axiom! But what good can be expected, while the ignorant and furious <HI>Biggots</HI> of every Sect, look on themselves and their Party, to be the only true Church of Christ; in the mean Time excluding all others, and saying, <HI>Lo Christ is here,</HI> or <HI>lo he is there, (Luke</HI> xvii. 21.) As if the Redeemers Kingdom was reduced to a <HI>Nut-shell,</HI> and he had no Fold but one; from such unhal∣lowed Zeal, and uncharitable Charity, may the good Lord deliver us!</P>
<P N="6">6. TRUE <HI>Zeal</HI> is <HI>Impartial,</HI> it is as hot against our own Sins, and the Sins of our Relations and Friends, as the Sins of others: It labours <HI>first</HI> to take the <HI>Beam</HI> out of our own <HI>Eye,</HI> before we at∣tempt to cast out the <HI>Mote</HI> of our <HI>Brothers Eye, (Matthew</HI> vii. 5.)</P>
<P N="7">7. UNIFORM, it respects all Gods <HI>Commands, (Ps.</HI> cxix. 6.) It is not hot for one, and cold towards another: But aims at, and labours for a Perfecti∣on of Obedience to all; and justly seeing all are of the same Tendency, and enjoined by the same Authority, (<HI>Philip.</HI> iii. 12, 13.) It consists prin∣ciply in the Fervor of our <HI>love</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> whereas a false Zeal consists chiefly in <HI>hatred</HI> against Man;
<PB N="23" REF="008745_0022_102FD87BAE7FCB18"/>
and therefore manifests itself in severe Censures upon the Sentiments and Actions of those it dislikes, (<HI>James</HI> 3 Chap.) As the Legs of the Lame are not equal, so the Life of a Hypocrite or false Zea∣lot, is not of a Piece; like <HI>Ephraim, he is a Cake not turned,</HI> half raw and half roasted, (<HI>Hosea</HI> vii. 8.) His <HI>Goodness</HI> is like the <HI>Morning Cloud,</HI> and <HI>early Dew, that soon passes away, (Hosea</HI> vi. 4.) A sudden <HI>Flash</HI> that soon expires, like that of a Fe∣vor, or of the stony Ground Hearers, (<HI>Mat.</HI> xiii. 5, 6.) But the <HI>Zeal</HI> of the truly pious, is like the natural Heat of the Body, which regularly digests the Nourishment it receives, and so animates and strengthens the Man: And like the Light of the Morning which shines more and more to the per∣fect Day!</P>
<P N="8">8. DISCREET, instead of magisterial Severity, or pharasaic Cruelty, it introduces <HI>Reproof,</HI> with a Commendation of what is praise-worthy in the Person reproved; this Method has an excellent Tendency to prevent or remove Prejudices, and excite to receive the Admonition kindly, which makes it more likely to answer the End designed: An Example of this, we have in our Lords treat∣ment of the Churches of <HI>Pergamus, Thyatira, Sardis,</HI> and <HI>Philadelphia, (Rev.</HI> 2 and 3 Chap.)</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="008745_0023_102FD87DDE4F7DB0"/>I MAY add, that true <HI>Zeal</HI> is attended with undaunted <HI>Bravery of Mind,</HI> and a generous <HI>prince∣ly Spirit;</HI> as appear in <HI>Nehemiah, Paul,</HI> and <HI>A∣raunah! Should such a Man as I flee? (Nehem.</HI> vi. 11.) <HI>What mean ye to weep, and break my Heart? For I am ready, not only to be bound, but to die at</HI> Je∣rusalem, <HI>for the Name of the Lord Jesus! (Acts</HI> xxi. 13.) <HI>All these Things did</HI> Araunah, <HI>as a King, give unto the King,</HI> (2 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxiv. 23.) But some Professors ingloriously change Shapes in Danger, as often as the <HI>Camelion</HI> its Colours▪ and in Mat∣ters of <HI>Charity,</HI> do more resemble <HI>Nabal</HI> than <HI>A∣raunah,</HI> (1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxv. 10, 11.) When help for <HI>Zion</HI> is asked, their little selfish Souls shrink with∣in their Iron Bosoms, like a <HI>Snail</HI> in its Shell, and are as impenitrable as <HI>Adamant,</HI> to all the Argu∣ments of Piety, Generosity, and public Spirit!</P>
<P>THE Excellency of a true <HI>Zeal</HI> appears, from the following Considerations, which recommend it to our Choice and Practice, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. ZEAL being Nothing but the Fervor and <HI>Vigor</HI> of every <HI>Grace,</HI> it hath in it all the <HI>Beauty</HI> and Excellency of all those Graces, and that in a high Degree of Eminence; if Love to God be ex∣cellent, then zealous fervent Love must needs be most excellent!</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="25" REF="008745_0024_102FD8800A8D33D0"/>2. THE <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>holy Objects</HI> is such, so great, so excellent, and of such transcendent and un∣speakable Importance, that we cannot be sincere, in our Esteem of them, and Pursuit after them, without Zeal: If it were about Riches and Honors, a cold Desire and dull Pursuit might serve the turn, but about God and Christ, and Grace and Heaven, such cold Desires and Endeavours are virtually a Contempt! To love God without Zeal, is not to love him at all, because it is not loving him as God: No desire of Christ, of Ho∣liness, and Heaven, is saving; but that which prefers them to all the Treasures and Delights of Life; and that which doth so, hath certainly some Zeal in it; so that <HI>Zeal</HI> is essential to every Grace, as Life and Heat is to a Man.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE Integrity and Honesty of the Heart to God, consisteth much in <HI>Zeal;</HI> as he that is true to his Friend is zealous for him, and not the Man that is indifferent and cold; to do his Ser∣vice with Zeal, is to do it willingly and heartily; to do it without Zeal, is to do it heartlesly, and by halves, and leave out the Life and Kernel of the Duty: It is the Heart that God doth first and most require, (<HI>Prov.</HI> xxiii. 26.) <HI>My Son give me thine Heart, and let thine Eyes observe my Ways.</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="008745_0025_102FD8823377EB28"/>
The <HI>End</HI> when <HI>valued</HI> according to its <HI>Worth,</HI> ex∣cites and directs the Affections and Endeavours, in that Order and Measure, as is proportioned to its Excellency, and the Difficulties of obtaining it: True Zeal animates Endeavours, as the Mo∣tion of the <HI>Heart,</HI> diffuses the Blood into the Veins, and the Spirits into the Arteries, to convey Life and Motion into all Parts of the Body: <HI>One Thing,</HI> saith the PSALMIST, <HI>have I desired of the Lord, and that will I seek after, that I may dwell in the House of the Lord, all the Days of my Life, to behold the Beauty of the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple. Whom have I in Heaven but thee? And there is none upon Earth that I desire besides thee, (Psalm</HI> xxvii. 5, and lxxiii. 25.) <HI>No Man can serve two Masters, God and Mamon: Either he will hate the one, and love the other, or hold to the one, and despise the other, (Matthew</HI> vi. 24.)</P>
<P N="4">4. ZEAL is the <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> of the <HI>Duty,</HI> and makes it like to attain its End; <HI>the fervent Prayer of the Righteous is effectual. (James</HI> v. 16.) Importunate Suitors are like to speed, <HI>the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth Violence, and the Violent take it by Force, (Matt.</HI> xi. 12.) We are commanded to <HI>STRIVE,</HI> as in an Agony, <HI>to enter in at the
<PB N="27" REF="008745_0026_102FD8850A4CCB88"/>
straight Gate.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Agonizesthe agonize, agonia, angor, trepidatio, animi estuatio,</HI> Anguish, trembling, and Fervency of Mind, <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 44. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> vi. 12.—<HI>Pasor.</HI></NOTE> And that for this Reason, <HI>Because many will seek to enter in, and shall not be able, (Luke</HI> xiii. 24.) Not every one that seeketh, findeth; not every one that striveth, is crowned; not every one that runeth, gains the Prize; but he that doth it <HI>lawfully,</HI> (2 <HI>Tim.</HI> ii. 5.) <HI>i. e.</HI> REGULARLY, HUMBLY, EARNESTLY, PERSEVERINGLY, (<HI>Isaiah</HI> lxvi. 2. <HI>Luke</HI> xi. 8, 9. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ix. 24. <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 1.) No wonder we are commanded to love God with all our Heart, Soul, and Mind, which is a zealous Love; for that overcomes all other Love, and constrains to Obedience: From what has been said it is evident, that <HI>Zeal</HI> is necessary to Salvati∣on, both in respect of <HI>Command</HI> and <HI>Mean,</HI> for it is not only enjoined by divine Authority, and has a gracious Promise annexed, (<HI>Rev.</HI> iii. 19.) but it has an Aptness, a Becomingness, a Tendency in itself, to the Object and the End proposed.</P>
<P N="5">5. ZEAL embraces and <HI>improves</HI> the <HI>Opportuni∣ties,</HI> and <HI>Seasons</HI> of Mercy and Grace; which Sloth and Negligence let slip: The zealous work while it is Day; they seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near;
<PB N="28" REF="008745_0027_102FD8869BBE1CA0"/>
they know the Day of their Visitation and Salvati∣on, while the Lukewarm and Indolent stupidly delay and trifle; audaciously harden their Hearts, and sleep with their Lamps unfurnished, and do not knock till the Door of Mercy be shut against them: <HI>Lukewarmness</HI> and Negligence are the <HI>Grave</HI> of Mercies, where they are ungratefully buried, till they rise up in Judgment against the Despisers of them: Surely the Improvers of Na∣ture shall condemn those Neglecters of Gospel Grace, yea the very <HI>Beasts</HI> shall be Witnesses a∣gainst many, who did not serve God with that Diligence, as they served them.</P>
<P N="6">6. ZEAL and Diligence are the <HI>victorious E∣nemies</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Satan;</HI> they cannot endure Sin; but are to it as a Fire to Thorns; they dally not with Iniquity, but reject the Motion instantly with Abhorrence, and avoid the Appearance of Evil; while the Vineyard of the Sluggard is over-grown with Thorns, and his Soul famishes with fruitless Wishes, because his Hands refuse to La∣bour: Impediments that stop a Sluggard, are as Nothing to a zealous Soul: As a Wheel that moves slowly, is stopt by a little Matter, which a quicker Motion easily Surmounts; a lively Ser∣vant makes a Pleasure of his Work, which a lazy one does with Pain and Weariness.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="29" REF="008745_0028_102FD888F75D2438"/>7. ZEAL is <HI>faithful,</HI> constant and <HI>valiant,</HI> and therefore greatly pleaseth God; it cleaves to him with unshaken Firmness, with a dving Gripe, in the midst of the most formidable Dangers and Calamities; the Fire consumeth it not, nor do many Waters quench it; but such as have a luke∣warm Religion, will be easily drawn or driven from it, they are so indifferent that a little more of the World put into the Scale, will weigh down Christ in their Esteem; the Hopes and Fears of temporal Things, prevail with them against the Hopes of eternal. No wonder therefore that God disowns such treacherous Servants, and turns them away as unworthy of his Family! (<HI>Luke</HI> xiv. 26, 27.) If a Man come to me, and hate not his Fa∣ther and Mother, and Wife and Children, and Brethren and Sisters, <HI>i. e.</HI> Comparitively he can∣not be my Disciple. Christian Prudence instead of opposing, realy befriends true Zeal, by direct∣ing it in respect of Time and Mode, so as to an∣swer its Design, but carnal Cunning opposes all Goodness,</P>
<P>IT is in vain to mask this malignant Iniquity of <HI>Lukewarmness,</HI> with the plausible Pretext of <HI>Mo∣deration,</HI> for that is only opposed to immoderate Desires, Fears, and Cares about earthly Things,
<PB N="30" REF="008745_0029_102FD89D512F2F68"/>
but not to <HI>Zeal</HI> about heavenly; for herein it is lawful, laudible, and truly Noble to excel! Their Necessity, Sublimity, Value, and Duration, re∣quire and deserve all the Ardor and Vehemence, all the Vigor, the Fire, the Force, of an immor∣tal Spirit; in its <HI>boldest</HI> Salleys, its widest Expan∣sions, and most intense Operations! It is true as to Things in their own Nature indifferent; we may, yea we ought to be indifferent; to <HI>rejoice as tho' we rejoiced not, and weep as tho' we wept not; because the Fashion of this World passes away;</HI> all its Enjoyments are rather an <HI>Appearance</HI> than a <HI>Reality,</HI> a meer <HI>Shadow</HI> that flee from our eager Embraces; a <HI>Scene</HI> that often Shifts, and will soon come to its final Period: But to be indifferent in a Matter of the greatest Moment, a Matter of Life and Death, a Matter of everlasting Life, and everlasting Death, is shocking and horrible! As irrational as it is ignoble, sinful, perilous, and damnable! <HI>Lukewarmness</HI> my Brethren, is ex∣ceeding dishonorable to God and Religion; nor can it when habitual and allowed, consist with the Truth of it: This monstrous Trifling with God and Salvation, Marrs all our sacred Service, deprives us of Communion with the divine Ma∣jesty, and exposes us to his Indignation and aw∣ful Judgments; as our Text and Context assure

us. This makes us uncomfortable to ourselves, and unprofitable to others; the very <HI>Lumber</HI> of the Creation, a Burden to the Earth, and a Poi∣son to the Air; <HI>cumberers</HI> of the Ground, barren Trees accursed by Christ; who are every Mo∣ment in danger of being cut down by the Ax of divine Justice, and cast into the Fire of Hell! <NOTE N="[b]" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> xii. 7. <HI>Matthew</HI> xxi. 19. <HI>Matthew</HI> iii. 10.</NOTE>
What can this crimson Iniquity proceed from, but a Contempt of God, and the Things of God?— An immoderate Love to the World,—Ignorance, Unwatchfulness,—Laziness,—Presumption,—un∣necessary and familiar Conversation with the Secure, —Conformity to the World,—engaging in unpro∣fitable Questions, which do not warm the Heart, and mend the Life; and carnal Contentions about Religion:—Now the Badness of these <HI>Causes,</HI> ma∣nifest the Meanness and Malignity of the <HI>Effect,</HI> and point to the <HI>Means</HI> necessary to prevent or remedy it.</P>

<P><PB N="33" REF="008745_0032_102FD8A681C83CE0"/>O CONSIDER my dear Brethren! that as the <HI>Master</HI> is great and good, and ever present, the <HI>Work</HI> difficult and excellent; so the <HI>Reward</HI> is glorious, incomprehensible, immortal: A <HI>King∣dom</HI> that is unshaken, a <HI>Crown</HI> that will never fade away, an exceeding great and eternal <HI>Weight</HI> of <HI>Glory;</HI> compared with which, all the light and momentary Afflictions of the present State, are not worthy to be compared; and in View of which they appear as <HI>Dross</HI> or <HI>Dung,</HI> yea shrink into Nothing, and are lighter than <HI>Vanity!</HI> This, this <HI>Felicity,</HI> will infinitely over-balance all our <HI>Labour</HI> and Ardor in quest of it!

no Profession of Religion at all, is in some respects more hopeful than that of a formal lukewarm Hy∣pocrite; no doubt both are offensive to God, and are in the Road to ruin; but it is better not to have known the Truth, than after the Knowledge of it to depart from the holy Commandment: As Sins against greater Light are more hainous, so in general such Persons are more puffed up with self-conceit than others, and having something to sa∣tisfy their natural Conscience with, are harder to be convinced of their bad State, which is never∣theless necessary to their Reformation; it may be therefore justly concluded, that their Condition is in some respects more perilous, than that of o∣thers; as many as I love, I rebuke and chasten, when they wander from me, or grow lukewarm in my Service: <HI>Be zealous therefore,</HI> if you would either prevent the inflicting of Judgments, or have them removed in Love; esteem and admire a regular well tempered <HI>Zeal</HI> in others, and cher∣ish it in your own Souls, for without this the Practice of religious Duty is but like a dead <HI>Carcase</HI> without a <HI>Soul</HI> to animate it; let God's Glory and in Subordination thereto, the Interest of his Kingdom be the grand Mark of all your Pursuits, whither natural, civil, or religious, and set every

Action in the whole circle of Life, tend to this truly noble Center, with an honest and steady Simplicity; and especially let love, ardent, su∣pream, and transcendent love to God, be the Spring, the Soul, the Scope, from, to, and in which, all the Acts, the Lines, the Streams of Life proceed, tend and terminate: O let this no∣ble Godlike Grace warm and inspire your Bosoms, enliven and animate all your Thoughts, Speeches and Actions, for God and his Kingdon; that you may be inclined from sweet Experience, from conscious Integrity, to speak in the seraphic, sub∣lime, and noble Language of the royal Prophet. <HI>Isaiah</HI> lxii. 1. <HI>For</HI> Zion's <HI>Sake I will not hold my Peace, and for</HI> Jerusalem's <HI>Sake I will not rest, un∣til the Righteousness thereof go forth as Brightness, and the Salvation thereof as a Lamp that burneth!</HI></P>
<P>AND now <HI>Sirs,</HI> what has been said concerning <HI>Zeal,</HI> should excite us to enquire, whither we have any <HI>Zeal</HI> at all, and if any, of what Kind it is? if true Zeal be the vigorous Exercise of Grace, then certainly those have it not who are destitute of the Grace of God; it would be therefore ab∣surd for me to excite the <HI>ungodly,</HI> or such as are not <HI>born again,</HI> to Exercise what they have not; instead of this, I would intreat those graceless <HI>Ga∣leos,</HI>

to begin at the <HI>Foundation; to make the Tree good, and the Fruit will be good, (Matt.</HI> vii. 17, and xii. 23.) To this End, <HI>plow up the fallow Ground of your Hearts;</HI> consider seriously and speedily your SIN AND DANGER, lest the righteous <HI>God tear you in Pieces, and there be none to deliver you! Awake thou that sleepest, arise from the Dead,</HI> and Christ shall give thee Light: <HI>Why stand ye all the Day idle in the Market-Place? Wherefore do ye spend your Money for that which is not Bread, and your Labour for that which satisfieth not?</HI> How long wilt thou sleep, O Sluggard, <HI>when wilt thou arise out of thy Sleep? How long halt ye between two Opinions, if the Lord be God follow him, but if</HI> Baal, <HI>then follow him: What shall a Man give in Exchange for his Soul, if he gain the whole World and loose the same? What meanest thou, O Sleeper, arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not!</HI></P>
<P>AND let such as have a <HI>false</HI> malignant <HI>Zeal,</HI> hear and consider the Words of Christ to a perse∣cuting <HI>Saul, Saul, Saul,</HI> why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks: On whomsoever the Stone which the Builders re∣jected falls, it will grind him to Powder!—</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="008745_0042_102FD8C0E96215F0"/>You that have <HI>true Zeal,</HI> labour to cherish and preserve it, and be more and more zealous for the glorious God, whatever blinded Sinners think, or say, or do against you: Bewail your past Remiss∣ness; <HI>arise and shine,</HI> for <HI>your Salvation is nearer than when ye believed; see that ye walk circumspect∣ly, not as Fools but as Wise, Redeeming the Time, because the Days are Evil:</HI> Take Care that your Zeal be qualified as before expressed, and thus be intrepid <HI>Heroes</HI> in the Cause of God and Religi∣on, and count not your lives dear, that ye may finish your Course with Joy; O think often on the noble Zeal of <HI>Abraham, Moses, Phinehas, E∣lijah, Nehemiah, Araunah,</HI> and above all; of the <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Prophets!</HI> And <HI>now Brethren, seeing we also are compassed about, with so great a Cloud of Witnesses, let us lay aside every Weight, and the Sin that doth so easily beset us; and let us run with Pati∣ence the Race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our Faith; who for the Joy that was set before him, endured the Cross, de∣spising the Shame, and is set down at the right Hand of the Throne of God,</HI> Amen.</P>
