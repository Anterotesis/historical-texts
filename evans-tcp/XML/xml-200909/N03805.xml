<P>OF all the meer Men who have lived since the Fall of <HI>Adam,</HI> the Author of this beautiful Passage is pronounced the wis∣est, by the GOD of Heaven. And of all the Books which he wrote, this is,
<PB N="6" REF="004683_0003_100DB7EC84224210"/>without Dispute, the most elegant, sublime and devout. The three Books which <HI>Solomon</HI> wrote, are resembled to the three Divisions of the Temple which he built; of which the <HI>Holy of Holies</HI> is compar'd to this admirable Song. His <HI>Proverbs</HI> contain an excellent Scheme of Morality; and to this answers the outward Enclosure, called the <HI>Court of the Gentiles.</HI> His <HI>Ecclesiastes</HI> contains the Disquisitions of a philosophical and religious Genius after true Happiness; and the solemn Reflections and pious Arguments render it a <HI>holy Place.</HI> But this <HI>Divine Song</HI> is all consecrated Rapture; 'tis the <HI>Holy of Holies:</HI> It must be approach'd with Reverence and Trembling, and it admits of no unhal∣lowed Feet to tread its awful Recesses.</P>
<P>The Title of the Book is, <HI>The Song of Songs;</HI> and it well deserves the Name, for it is the finest poetical Com∣posure now extant in the World. It is not every where over-nice and exact in its Metaphers and Allusions; but they are bold and grand, elevated and lofty, all Fire, all consecrated Rap∣ture and Inspiration!</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004683_0004_100DB7EF4C41AA30"/>
The Criticks in the Art of Poetry will presently see that it is a <HI>Drama∣tic</HI> Composition of that kind to which perhaps the Moderns would give the Name of a <HI>Pastoral Opera.</HI> That it is a <HI>Dramatic</HI> Performance is easily discerned, inasmuch as it consists whol∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of Action, Dialogue, and Character: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is a personal Representation of Pas∣sion and History, all which are the exact Description and Character of the <HI>Drama.</HI> It is an <HI>Opera;</HI> it seems to con∣fist of three Acts; The Numbers are of the Lyrick Kind; and it has in it the evident Intimations of Musick, and a Chorus. And it is a <HI>Pastoral;</HI> for the Scenes are mostly laid in the Country; and the Characters and Images are principally rural.</P>
<P>But more than this, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is a Divine Poem
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>I purposely avoid the vain Disputes of late raised, about the Canonical∣ness of this Book. The Testimony of the Jewish Church, and the Forty∣fifth Psalm are a sufficient Vindica∣tion of it, if we had not other abun∣dant Evidence.</HI></NOTE>. It contains a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Picture of
<PB N="8" REF="004683_0005_100DB7F0EC80AB70"/>the Loves of CHRIST and his Church. He is the heavenly Bridegroom, and she the beautiful Shepherdess, that are the principal Speakers in the Song. With how much Admiration doe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the sacred Spouse look up to the lovely JESUS, and how full of Passion and Transport are her Expressions about him! And on the other Hand, with what Tenderness and Delight does the blessed SAVIOUR overlook the Defects of his Church, and applaud the Graces which he had before lighted up in her smiling Form? <HI>Who is she that looketh forth as the Morning? Fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun, and awful as an Army with Banners?</HI></P>
<P>Among the many fond and endear∣ing Sentences, my Text is none of the least remarkable. There are a thou∣sand Beautiful glowing in the Senti∣ments and Expressions. 'Tis a Speech that well suits with the graceful Lips of him, who spake so as never Man spake; that well sutes with the hea∣venly Form of her, who is the chosen Bride of JESUS CHRIST — O thou fairest among the most elegant of the Works of GOD!</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004683_0006_100DB7F29AE183F8"/>
The Words are a Description of the Spring of the Year, in the Land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> Great Part of it may be li∣terally applied to our Spring: But in some Respects it varies. The Winter there, as in our Mother-Country, used to be cloudy and rainy, and a steady fair Weather used to smile on the Face of the Spring. Indeed it is otherwise in our inconstant Climate, where we see the Clouds so frequently returning after the Rain.</P>
<P>Without going into the mystical or prophetical Way of explaining these Words, I shall only observe, That they are the Invitation of CHRIST to his beloved Church. Every true Be∣liever in JESUS, and Follower of the Lamb, may apply the Address to himself. He may take up his Bible, and say, I hear the dear Words of my LORD JE∣SUS, <HI>Arise up, and come away.</HI>—Besure when the Flowers appear on the Earth; when the Rain and Cold of the Winter is past, and the Spring begins to blos∣som and flourish, and renew the Face of the Ground, this Call is in a pecu∣liar Manner to be heard, from our blessed Redeemer, <HI>Arise and come away.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004683_0007_100DB7F5B5F96200"/>
The Doctrine then that I shall offe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from the Words, is this.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<Q><HI>When we see the Spring open upon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Earth, we may hear the Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> CHRIST <HI>to us, to rise up from t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Earth, and repair to him.</HI></Q>
<P>In the Illustration of this Point <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Doctrine, I shall do two Thing<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. I. <HI>Show what is implied in the Call</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> CHRIST, <HI>Rise up, and come awa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> II. <HI>Why this Call is in a peculiar Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ner seasonable when the Winter is pas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and the Spring opens.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>What is implied in the Invitati<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of</HI> CHRIST, <HI>Rise up, and come away<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></P>
<P>I shall be but brief here, that I m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> hasten to a more seasonable and u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦common Set of Meditations. And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> short then, when we hear the Cal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> CHRIST, <HI>Rise up, and come away,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> presently discover the Condition <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those who are addressed! They are i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦dolent and supine and sleepy Creature<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. They want to be roused and quickne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and are by Nature bowed down, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="11" REF="004683_0008_100DB7F87338F5F8"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure and dead. The Voice is, <HI>Rise up.</HI> Shake off the mortal Lethargy that hangs upon your Eye-lids. Arise from the dead, and CHRIST shall give thee Life. A wake thou that sleepest, and call upon thy GOD. And indeed, all Mankind need such a Call as this, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey are dead in Trespasses and Sins. They are cold and lifeless Corpses, un∣able to help themselves, and can do nothing spiritually Good. They are not able as of themselves, to think so much as a good Thought: And they have only a Power of chusing which Sin to commit. They may if they please talk of a <HI>Free-Will,</HI> and amuse themselves with the idle Notion. But alas, they are <HI>free amongst the dead:</HI> Free 'tis true, in their Choice of Wick∣edness, but it must be the infinite Pow∣er of GOD that can incline them to any Thing spiritually good. Our preaching to them is indeed only pro∣phesying over dry Bones: Though this sometimes does Wonders. In one Word, they act entirely from selfish Principles, negligent and forgetful of the Glory of GOD. They are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>owed down to Earth and Creatures,
<PB N="12" REF="004683_0009_100DB7FA01614580"/>and their own abject Will; and have need to be awaked, <HI>Rise up.</HI></P>
<P>And what is implied in this Phrase, when it is spoken by our Lord CHRIST to his People? In a few Words, It comprises in it, our Duty to our LORD JESUS. We are called to <HI>believe</HI> in CHRIST. To rise up from a vain Earth, and raise our Eyes to invisible and eternal Realities. To walk by Faith, and not by Sight.</P>
<P><HI>Rise up;</HI> 'tis a Call to <HI>Repentance</HI> that we are by Nature so bowed down. It comes with a Voice of Conviction and Awakening; to rouse our drowsy Faculties, and shake us from our Secu∣rity and Indifference. <HI>Rise up,</HI> or we shall lie down among the dead; slide down to the Congregation of the dam∣ned.</P>
<P>'Tis a Call to <HI>Holiness</HI> and Obedi∣ence. <HI>Rise up</HI> and walk: It demands a holy Walk of us; and tells us that our Conversation should be in Heaven; that we should seek the Things which are above, and carry our Treasure over into the other World. The Path of the Just—shines brighter as it rises higher.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004683_0010_100DB7FB8FC6AE58"/>
<HI>Rise up,</HI> it bespeaks our <HI>Meditation</HI> and <HI>Prayer.</HI> Lift up your Eyes and Hands, your Hearts and your Souls. Is it not a Shame that this Earth should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eize our Thoughts and Affections, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd GOD and CHRIST have so little of them. There is not an Object we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ee, but may serve to raise our Thoughts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o GOD. His glorious Name is di∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inely impressed upon all his Works; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd with one Voice, they all call out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o us, GOD! GOD! <Q>I was made by GOD! I am supported by GOD! I am a Servant of GOD! and an In∣strument in his Hand! <HI>Rise up!</HI> Arise and adore GOD. Contem∣plate him, pray to him, adore and bless him.</Q></P>
<P>But to finish this Point, It will be the Call of CHRIST to us quickly <HI>to leave this World; Rise up and come a∣way.</HI> Death shall arrive with this wel∣come Message, <HI>The Master calleth for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hee.</HI> This will finish our Life upon this Earth, the Voice of CHRIST inviting us to his Kingdom and Glory. <HI>Rise up and come away, the Winter is past, the Rain is over and gone.</HI> Every Evil will be concluded forever, and we shall
<PB N="14" REF="004683_0011_100DB7FE62BE1E88"/>enter into Rest: The <HI>Winter</HI> of Afflic∣tion, Temptation and Sin, will no more molest us: The Evils of this World, which fell on us like a continual drop∣ping in a very rainy Day, will descend no more about us. <HI>The Rain is over and gone.</HI> No more Storms will roar in our Air; nor Clouds intercept our Sunshine. The last Tempest of Death will beat after us but a little Way; and rapid we shall leave it behind. And now, welcome everlasting Delights! Welcome the opening Dawn of Para∣dise! <HI>The Time of the singing of Birds is come.</HI> Angels tune their Harps, and join their Voices about us. <HI>The Flow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs appear upon the Earth;</HI> and the e∣verlasting Hills lift up their flowry Tops before us. Joys unfelt till this blessed Moment, will now seize our beating Hearts, and our Souls will leap out, obedient to the dear Voice that calls us, <HI>Rise up, and come away.</HI></P>
<P>These, I think, are natural Heads for Meditation from the Words: But that which I principally intend to al∣lude to, in the Process of this Discourse, is, that when we see the annual Spring open upon the Earth, we have a Call
<PB N="15" REF="004683_0012_100DB8016240FB60"/>to <HI>Rise up to CHRIST in holy Medi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ations:</HI> To come away from lower Objects to him the highest and most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orthy of all. The Be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ties which mile around us, at this lovely Season of the Year, unite to lead our Thoughts to CHRIST. And this is the second Point to be spoken to.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>How is the Invitation of our blessed Saviour to rise up and come away, pecu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iarly adapted to the Spring of the Year?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The Spring looks like the natural Beginning of the Year:</HI> And besure <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e are to begin our Year with GOD. The Demand and Expectation of the lessed GOD is, for the <HI>first-ripe Fruits.</HI> And it is reasonable that our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst Care should be to please him, our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rst Hours consecrated to him. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>emands of us the first Day in every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eek, and why should he not for the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost part have the first Hour in every <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay; and the first Season in every Year. <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of GOD,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Direction of CHRIST. A Year <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gun with GOD, is a Year well be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, and it will yield a comfortable
<PB N="16" REF="004683_0013_100DB802EBF1D8F0"/>Reflection all the Year, for us to call to Mind how we have been enabled to spend the first Months of it.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>The Temptations of the Spring af∣ford another Argument for us to obey the Call of CHRIST, Rise up, and come away.</HI> That the Spring is attended with many Circumstances to tempt a∣way our Minds from GOD and Du∣ty, will very easily be rendred plain and evident. Then 'tis that the Face of Nature puts on the most gay and alluring Smiles; and the beautiful Pros∣pects about us are apt to catch away our Thoughts, and possess and fill up our Minds. Then 'tis too, that our animal Spirits are most sprightly and vigorous; and our fermented Blood pours along its rapid Current more warm and impetuous. The Chains of the Winter are melted off: and the <HI>Bands of Orion are loosed:</HI> And from this Flush of Blood and Spirits, there arises a Variety of Temptations. Our Appetites are most raging and violent and our inferiour Faculties most apt t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> usurp the Throne of Reason and Con¦science. We are now most easily de∣ceived
<PB N="17" REF="004683_0014_100DB8052A3DACC8"/>with the tempting Prospects of Futurity; and we presume upon a vain Earth, and Happiness here below, from a Warmth of Temper, and the Dispo∣sition of our Blood and animal Spirits. Thus we see the Temptations of the Spring both external and internal. Ex∣ternal, from the alluring Face of Na∣ture; Internal, from our own Frame and Constitution. How proper then the Call? <HI>Rise up and come away.</HI> Does the <HI>low</HI> Face of the Ground tempt us? <HI>Rise up.</HI> Get above the Earth. Leave the Molehill for the Emmits to inhabit; but let us take to our selves Wings, as Angels, and fly away. Have we our Temptations in <HI>our selves? Come away</HI> then; let us get out of our selves into CHRIST; se∣parate our selves from our selves, and mortify and root out the corrupted self∣ish Principle in us.</P>
<P>And indeed nothing will have a greater Tendency to demonstrate our Sincerity in Religion, than our Reso∣lution to defeat the strongest Tempta∣tions which assault us in this World. When Sin spreads all its Snares, and lays all its alluring Bates in our Way,
<PB N="18" REF="004683_0015_100DB8080E673D98"/>if we have then Power to overcome all, and pass unhurt amidst all, it will be a good Evidence that we are inspi∣red with a Power superiour to our own: That the Holy Spirit is in us; and that we are in good Earnest in Religion. The same Arguments to persuade Youth to serious Piety, are in the same Sense proper to perswade us to Religion in the Spring. Because we may all the Year look back on it with this concomitant Satisfaction, When Temptations were most universal, and most impetuous, I stood the Shock, and was carried graciously thro' them.</P>
<P>And what an Honour will it be for us to overcome Temptations when they are at the strongest; and regu∣late our Appetites when they are most raging and lawless? So <HI>Joseph,</HI> fortifi∣ed with the Grace of GOD, withstood Satan and himself together, joined in the most dangerous League; he broke loose from the Toils of Death, and by a wise Retreat, rushed away, pursued by Victory and Triumph. This is more to the Honour of young <HI>Joseph,</HI> than a Monument of Brass, and the Trophies of conquered Nations! When
<PB N="19" REF="004683_0016_100DB80A26A9B868"/>the <HI>Caesars</HI> and the <HI>Alexanders,</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Conquerors of the East, blush and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de, <HI>Joseph</HI> shall stand applauded by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Judge of the World, and saluted by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>outing Armies of Men and Angels. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d it will be an Honour of the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ature, for us to be most firm and re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ute, when Temptations are most fre∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ent and violent. So that if it has been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ved, that the Spring of the Year, is Season lying most open to Tempta∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns, it plainly follows, that Religion this precarious Season, is attended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th additional Honours.</P>
<P>Besides, the Rewards of our future <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ory, will be proportioned to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bours and Difficulties. We know <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t <HI>he who soweth sparingly shall reap <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ingly;</HI> and they who take the grea∣Pains, shall reap the fullest Harvest. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>w he who stands his Ground against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Opposition, who beats through <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> thickest Temptations best, shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ive the brightest Crown, and hear <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>loudest Applause. So that if we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ld attain the highest Degrees of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry, one Way is to spend that Time <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which is fullest of Temptations. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en it was asserted, that the Spring
<PB N="20" REF="004683_0017_100DB80C7648B2B0"/>is the Season fullest of Temptations, a vain Mind would perhaps have drawn another Consequence: Let me then wait for a more convenient Season for the Duties of Religion and Holiness. But it is you see easily retorted. Is the Spring of the Year fullest of Temp∣tations, sure then we have most need of gracious Hearts. This will be at∣tended with the highest Pleasure in the Reflection here; This will be fol∣lowed with the amplest Rewards of Heaven hereafter. This will prove our Sincerity to us with the fullest Evi∣dence. For, as one speaks, if there is no Enemy, there can be no Fight; if no Fight, no Victory; if no Victory no Crown. And on the contrary, if there be powerful Ene∣mies, there will ensue a sharper Fight, a greater Victory, and a brighter Crown. But to take the Objectors in their own Way —</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>The Advantages of the Spring af∣ford another Argument why we should obey the Call of CHRIST, Rise up and come away. Rise up and come away, for the Winter is past, the Rain is over and gone;</HI> many Disadvantages are over and gone: <HI>The Time of the singing of
<PB N="21" REF="004683_0018_100DB80F60B2BE28"/>Birds is come, and the Flowers appear upon the Earth;</HI> many Advantages <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ome pouring round us, and call, and awaken, excite and quicken us.</P>
<P>If it can be proved that there are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eculiar Advantages in the Spring for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Duties and the Delights of Piety, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t will follow of Course that we ought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make Use of these Advantages, and improve them while they last: For they are all but so many Talents com∣mitted to us by the GOD of Nature, which he will call us to a strict Ac∣count for, and miserable we, if we can give no good Account of them.</P>
<P>And that the Spring of the Year is indeed attended with such Advantages for the Labours and Delights of Piety, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll be evident upon a very little Re∣fection. Now it is that the Days leng∣then apace, and the Light increases over <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s. The Morning awakes us early; and the Day-spring from on high, the rising Sun, calls us betimes from our Slumbers, <HI>Rise up, and come away.</HI> Now it is also, that the Weather grows moderate, and we bless the Indulgence of the mild Skies, and the temperate Air. We are not chained up with
<PB N="22" REF="004683_0019_100DB810EA24DD38"/>Cold, or confined by the bleak Winds. We may live more in one Day now, than in many that are numbed with Frost, and chilled by the Rigour of the Winter. Now it is also that our Spi∣rits awaken, and our Blood has a cheer∣ful and lively Flow, so that our Souls are most sprightly, vigorous and active. Our Bosoms kindle with new Delights, and we enjoy the smiling Hours that glide smoothly by us. It is a most hap∣py Season to revive the Joys of Piety, and raise our Satisfactions in the bles∣sed GOD to a renewed Ardor and Ve∣hemence. Add to this, now it is that our Health is at its best Estate, unmo∣lested by the cold Rheums of the Win∣ter, or the faint Heats of the Summer-Noons. Besides, the opening of the Earth by the Plough, and the Odours of the various Blossoms scattered from every glowing Tree around, conspire to call back the declining Health, or esta∣blish the sound Constitution. So that we see new Advantages arise in every Light, and are convinced how many Opportunities we have for the Service of GOD, and the Raptures of Devotion, let us look where we will. Whether
<PB N="23" REF="004683_0020_100DB813AA779CD0"/>we consider the lengthened Days, and the many Hours of Light and Business: The moderate Weather, and fine Temperature of the Air and Skies: The Chearfulness of our Spirits, and our confirmed Health; — they all with one Voice agree in the Call, <HI>Rise up, and come away.</HI> Rise up to GOD; serve him in these golden Seasons, these smiling Moments, which though they dance along so smoothly, wing away so swiftly. Lovely as they are, they will be quickly gone and over. Let them not pass without this additional Delight in the Reflection, that we ser∣ved GOD in them, and tasted the sub∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mest Transports of Devotion, while we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lled them up in Communion with GOD.</P>

Now the Works of GOD shine in our Eyes, with the most finished Beau∣ty, and raise our Thoughts to the in∣finite Artificer, who has poured out such a Profusion of Charms and Graces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the wide Creation. <HI>The Flowers appear upon the Earth, and the Time of

Thus have I taken you with me <HI>to meditate in the Fields.</HI> We have been surveying the beautiful Scenes of the Spring: And shall we have no good Effect of the soft Prospects? Shall not a rival Glory open and dawn in our ravished Hearts, while all the Fields flourish about us? O for a Spring now! and that even while I am speaking, e∣very consenting Breast may feel new Delights in GOD kindle with a sud∣den Flame, and glow with immortal Ardor! That is the Design as of all the Messages from the Pulpit, so par∣ticularly of this Discourse on the spring∣ing Year. I would call your Souls in to flourish like the Earth about you.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xxxii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>My Doctrine shall drop as the Rain, my Speech shall distill as the Dew; as the small Rain upon the tender Herb; and as the Showers upon the Grass. Away! thou North-wind, and come thou South, blow upon my Garden, that the Spices thereof may flow out.</HI></P>

Those of us who have recovered from the Sick-Bed, methinks, may hear the loud Call, <HI>Rise up, — Arise, and walk!</HI> Taste the renewed Bounties of Heaven with redoubled Pleasure, while we redouble our Labours for GOD, and his Kingdom. But, ah! Let us not think the <HI>Danger is all past, and the Rain is over and gone;</HI> for the Clouds return after the Rain; Death shall quickly shut the pleasing Scene, and the <HI>Days of Darkness shall be many. Do therefore with thy Might, what thy Hand findeth to do.</HI> If all the Care of Heaven to manure and cultivate you be lost, the Voice quickly will be that, <HI>No Fruit be found on thee for ever! Cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it down!</HI>—Ah! <HI>rejected and nigh unto Cursing, thy End is to be burned.</HI></P>
<P>And indeed, The Address of Hea∣ven is proper for us all: For we are all in the Spring of our Being, while we are in this Life. Eternity is like an endless Year, of which this Life is like the budding Spring. And, as the Spring is, the Year will be more or less fruit∣ful and blessed. If in this Life we dis∣obey GOD; the Spring of this Life
<PB N="44" REF="004683_0041_100DB844FAE2EBB0"/>will end in the Heat of a withered Summer, the Flames of eternal Fire. If, on the contrary, we serve GOD from a Principle of Faith in CHRIST, our Spring will end in a blessed Har∣vest: And we shall enter upon the Feast of the Fruits that adorn Paradise. Death it self will but convey us to the Regions of immortal Life: And our LORD JESUS CHRIST the good Shep∣herd, will lead us through the dark Valley, to the green Pastures, and the still Waters. There the Groves ever blossom, the Flowers ever flourish, and the Fields are ever green. There JESUS himself blooms in unveiled Charms, and invites us to him, with his dear Voice. We may lie upon the Bed of Death, and see the endless Glo∣ries shine behind the Glooms, and guild and break away the awful Shadows. We may see our dear SAVIOUR at a Di∣stance, encouraging our defired Flight. We may hear his Voice sound charm∣ing through the dark Length of the Vale of Death; <HI>Rise up, and come away!</HI> And the last Words we utter, when we leave the Flourish of the lower Spring
<PB N="45" REF="004683_0042_100DB846A6DDC888"/>may be like that,

<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. lv. 10—13.</NOTE> <HI>For as the Rain cometh down, and the Snow from Heaven, and returneth not thithor, but watereth the Earth, and maketh it bring forth and bud, that it may give Seed to the Sower, and Bread to the Eater: So shall my Word be that goeth forth out of my Mouth: it shall not return unto me void, but it shall ac∣complish that which I please, and it shall prosper in the Thing whereto I sent it. For ye shall go out with Joy, and be led forth with Peace: the Mountains and the Hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the Trees of the Field shall clap their Hands. Instead of the Thorn shall come up the Fir-tree, and instead of the Brier shall come up the Myrtle-Tree: and it shall be to the LORD for a Name, for an everlasting Sign, that shall not be cut off.

And the parched Ground shall become a Pool, and the thirsty Land Springs of Water: In the habitation of Dragons, where each lay, shall be Grass with Reeds and Rushes. — No Lion shall be there, nor any ravenous Beast shall go up there∣on, it shall not be found there: but the redeemed shall walk there. And the ransomed of the LORD shall return and come to Zion with Songs, and everlasting Joy upon their Heads: they shall obtain Joy and Gladness, and Sorrow and Sigh∣ing shall flee away.</HI></P>
