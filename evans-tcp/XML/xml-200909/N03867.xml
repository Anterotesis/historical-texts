<HEAD>A <HI>RIGHT</HI> TO THE LORD'S SUPPER CONSIDERED.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">M</SEG>Y Obligations to you have been too many and great, to allow me to decline to gratify your Desire of giv∣ing you my Thoughts in Writing, concerning a Right to the Sacrament of the LORD'S SUPPER I am too well acquainted with you, in the least to question, either the Goodness of your End, in demanding this of me; or your Prudence, in

making a proper Use of my Freedom in open∣ing my Mind to you, relating to the Subject of your Enquiry. My own Insufficiency to give you due Satisfaction, is what lies most in the Way of my attempting it. However, whether I fail in it or not, I believe your Can∣dour is such, That you will take in good Part my sincere Endeavours to serve you; and shall therefore without any further Proem or Delay, enter into the Service you require of me.</P>
<P>I shall then, <HI>Sir,</HI> shew you my Opinion o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Point you write to me about, in severa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> PROPOSITIONS, which with their <HI>Ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stration</HI> will comprise the substance of what I defig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this Letter to you.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="proposition">
<P>My first PROPOSITION is, <HI>That no Perso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> has a</HI> RIGHT <HI>to partake of the Ordinance of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> LORD'S SUPPER, <HI>but such only as are</HI> ALLOW¦ED <HI>and</HI> COMMANDED <HI>of</HI> GOD <HI>to partake o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it.</HI></P>
<P>Whether we consider the Participation <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this Ordinance as a <HI>Duty</HI> or as a <HI>Priviledg<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> this will certainly hold a Truth.

This Sacrament is one of the <HI>po<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tive Institutions</HI> of Jesus Christ, which ought be attended by all and only such, as God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ders to attend it. If any Man or Wom presumeth to partake of it without his Le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Command so to do, God may say to su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>

yea he does say to them as in Isai. 1 12. <HI>When ye come to appear before me, Who hath required this at your Hands?</HI> And on the other Hand, such as God allows and commands to partake of the Ordinance of the Lord's Supper, may not presume to omit or neglect it: if they do they are therein guilty of sinning against God. He that is qualified to partake of the Lord's Supper, according to the Judgment of God expressed in his Word, has a Right to it, and is bound to partake of it, tho' he may think the contrary. If a Man be not qualified he sins if he receives it, whatever good Opinion he has of himself <HI>Men's Op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nions</HI> concerning themselves or other do not alter GOD'S <HI>Laws.</HI> A Man may be mistaken respecting his own State, and think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e has no Right to that which he has a Right to; Or otherwise, he may have a good Right to that which he judgeth himself utterly unqualified for: But God's Commands are uniform and steady; they change not a Men's Notions and Opinions do, Every Man is either qualified according to the Word of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o partake of the Lord's Supper, or unqualified for it: if he be qualified, he is bound to partake; if unqualified, he may not presume to partake of this holy Ordinance, The like may be said, with respect to the <HI>Judgment</HI> of any <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Churches.</HI> If a Man be qualified to partake of the Sacrament, no Judgment of any Church can take away his Right: If he be really unqualified f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r it, no Church can give him a Right to it. Indeed in Point of <HI>Order,</HI> no Person may partake, unless by the <HI>Church</HI> he be permitted to do it; but
<PB N="4" REF="004754_0006_100DE76BE147B6E0"/>
then if the Church do admit a visibly unquali∣fied Person, they are guilty of Sin in it; and so they are also if they debar a <HI>visibly qualified</HI> Person from it. I say <HI>visibly qualified,</HI> because the Church is bound to admit such as are visibly qualified, whether they are really qualified or not; but in this Case the Persons offering themselves are guilty—. A Person ought to come to the Lord's Supper, who is according to Rule qualified for it, whatever other Quali∣fication, not required, he may be without, and knows that he is so. Therefore, if the <HI>Grace</HI> of <HI>Regeneration</HI> be no necessary Qualification to give a Man a Right; The judicious M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Sioddard</HI> erred not, in saying, <HI>A Person <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and ought to partake, tho' he knew hims<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>onverted,</HI> having those Qualifications that are necessary.</P>
<P>From what has been said we may infer, That it is <HI>not probable,</HI> that it should be very <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifficult</HI> for a serious Enquirer to know whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e has a <HI>Right</HI> to the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> or not. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is not likely, that our merciful Redeemer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ould make the Terms of Church Communi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>n such, that it should be <HI>extreamly difficult</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Persons to know whether <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> partake of this Sacrame<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave them under unav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with Respect to this important Case.

I would have this remembred, it be∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g a Consideration that I shall have Occasion make Use of.

<P>GOD <HI>does not allow and command</HI> THE WICKED, <HI>while they continue such, to partake of the Ordinance of the Lord's Supper.</HI> I say, while they <HI>continue such;</HI> for otherwise they are invited and required to qualify themselves <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>en to come to it.

<P>Who are in <HI>Scripture</HI> usually intended by <HI>the Wicked,</HI> and who I here therefore intend, we may see in the following Particulars. (1) All <HI>Atheists,</HI> who believe not the Being and

It is possible Persons unregenerate may put <HI>some Trust</HI> in God, and have <HI>some sort of Hope</HI> in him, and of such a Trust and Hope I here speak, see <HI>Psal.</HI> 78.34, 35, 36.

<P>That you may not think, that in this I am altogether singular, I will here transcribe some Words of that learned and judicious Man, Dr. OWEN, in his <HI>Perseverance of the Saints,</HI> Page 10.

<P>I do not here affirm, That <HI>every Disciple</HI> of Jesus Christ, has an immediate Right to partake of this Sacrament, or is in a present Capacity to receive it; but, That for Persons to be Disci∣ples of Christ, is so necessary, that without this no Man has a Right to the Lord's Supper. When our Lord first instituted this holy Sa∣crament, he <HI>gave it to his Disciples</HI> and none else; and he ordered those to whom he then administred it, and their Successors, to do as he, in their Presence, had done; and this even to his second Coming, <HI>Luk</HI> 22 10. 1 <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r.</HI> 11.23, 26. But we must not think, that because these were all of them <HI>Minister,</HI> yea <HI>Apostles,</HI> to whom Christ first gave the Sacrament, it will from hence follow, that none but Ministers have a Right to it. The Command of <HI>Admi∣nistring</HI> this Ordinance, was indeed only given to <HI>Ministers;</HI> but that of <HI>receiving</HI> of it was not so, but belonged to <HI>Disciples,</HI> as such, whe∣ther they were Ministers, or others. Accor∣dingly <HI>the Church</HI> of <HI>Corinth</HI> was by the Apostle admonished and instructed, with Relation to it. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.23, and onward. Others bendes Ministers need it, to assist their Remembrance of Christ, and are required to qualify them∣selves to partake of it.</P>
<P>Now a DISCIPLE is the same with a <HI>Learner</HI> or <HI>Scholar.</HI> And accordingly, they are all Disciples of Jesus Christ, who are committed to his Care, in the Way of the Gospel: And thus

<P>To make this manifest, I shall here observe, That, whereas the <HI>Disciples of</HI> JESUS CHRIST have in Scripture several <HI>Names</HI> or <HI>Titles</HI> given them, as, <HI>Disciples, Believers, Christians, Saints,</HI> &amp;c. These Names and Titles are all or most of them, according to the Stile and Language of the Scripture, applicable to some that are not savingly converted. I shall briefly con∣sider those now mentioned; and (1) For the Word <HI>Disciple,</HI> we have already seen in Part, that it is applied to some that are not in a rege∣nerate State. A Person <HI>professing</HI> the Religion of Jesus Christ, with a <HI>moral Sincerity,</HI> as above explained, must be acknowledged to be a <HI>Dis∣ciple</HI> of his, tho' not yet in a State of Grace. Persons may be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> entred into Christ's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>truction, tho' they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght of him, as to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m, and the Things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to their eternal Peace and Welfare, or to <HI>know the Truth as it is in Jesus, and live according to it.</HI></P>
<P>Nor does the Use of this Word in Scripture necessarily import such a Knowledge and Prac∣tice of spiritual Things and Duties, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is pecu∣liar to Persons in a State of Grace, but it is most

commonly used for such as were <HI>Followers of</HI> JESUS CHRIST, and as have received his Doctrine, without any Design of restraining the Sense of it, to such as were, in the strictest Sense, sincere Converts, see <HI>Mark</HI> 8.14. and <HI>Acts</HI> 9.1. (2) So the Word, to <HI>believe,</HI> is fre∣quently used with Relation to such as believe <HI>the Doctrine of</HI> CHRIST, without being restrain∣ed in the Application of it, to such as believe in a saving Manner, see <HI>Acts</HI> 21.20, and 25. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.12. and <HI>John</HI> 2.23, 24, 25. Persons may <HI>believe</HI> in the Sense of these Places, tho' they are not savingly converted; they are not <HI>Infidels.</HI> (3) The Word <HI>Christian,</HI> is not, I think, ever in Scripture used, in such a restrain∣ed Sense, as to signify such only a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are regene∣rate, but largely, for such as <HI>profess and visibly obey the Gospel of</HI> CHRIST, whether they are truely converted or not: So I think it may be taken in the three Places where it is used, <HI>viz.

For it had been better for them not to have known the Way of Righteousness, than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them. But it happened unto them accor∣ding to the true Proverb, The Dog is turned to his own Vomit again; and, The Sow that was washed, to her wallowing in the Mire,</HI> with which compare <HI>Heb.</HI> 6.4. and Chap. 10.20. also <HI>Ezek.</HI> 18.24, and 26.

<P>In this Sacrament God also shews, That such was his <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Compassion</HI> towards the perishing Children of Men, that rather than they should be damned forever, he was willing to give his only begotten Son, to be a Propitiation for their Sins, by dying a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tter &amp; shameful Death for them as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ared in the Scriptures, see 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 4.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.10. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.26.

drink unworthily, and so eat and drink Judgmen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to themselves.</HI> To which I ANSWER, That th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is readily granted: but still the Question re∣maineth, <HI>That Qualifications Persons must find themselves to have, before they are allowed to come to the Sacrament?</HI> If it be said, <HI>They must find themselves to be in a regenerate State before they offer themselves;</HI> this is to beg the Thing in Question. It does not yet appear, that this is required to the End mentioned, but rather that this is not required. If it be further said, <HI>That Persons must not come to the Lord's Supper, unless they can</HI> DISCERN <HI>the Lord's Body in it;</HI> I acknowledge this to be a Truth; because the Scripture is clear for it: But then I utterly deny, that an Ability to discern the Lord's Body in the Lord's Supper is peculiar to the regene∣rate He that believes the Doctrines of the Sufferings of the Son of God, in our Nature, for the Sins of the World, and understands how these Sufferings of his are signified and shewed forth in the Sacrament, may be truly said to discern the Lord's Body therein. It is true indeed, that the Regenerate do discern the Lord's Body in a more excellent and affecting Manner, than unregenerate Persons can do: But still it remains unproved, That such a Dis∣cerning as this is absolutely necessary to a law∣ful Participation in the Lord's Supper.</P>
<P>If it be again said, <HI>That as adult Persons may not be baptised, unless they</HI> BELIEVE WITH ALL THEIR HEART, Acts 8.37 <HI>So, without such Faith, Persons may not partake of the Lord's Supper;</HI> I readily acknowledge the Truth of this: But then I say, That Men's <HI>believing

with all their Heart,</HI> that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, as in the Place referred to, does not necessarily imply their being in a regene∣rate State.

<P>I readily acknowledge also, That REPEN∣TANCE <HI>is necessary in order to a Participation in the Ordinance of the Lord's Supper:</HI> But then I conceive that Persons may be in some Sense <HI>real Penitents</HI> who are <HI>not yet born again:</HI> And this I think may be proved from <HI>Matth.</HI>

<HEAD>PROPOSITION VII.</HEAD>
<P><HI>There are</HI> GREAT INCONVENIENCIES <HI>at∣tending on this Assertion, That none but the Re∣generate have a Right to partake of the Lord's Supper.</HI></P>
<P>I shall briefly mention some of them.</P>
<P N="1">1. Very few can, on this Supposition, satisfy themselves, whether they may lawfully par∣take of the Lord's Supper, or not: And so ma∣ny would, on this Principle, be unavoidably ex∣posed to very great Perplexities with Respect to this Question, <HI>Whether they may and ought to desire an Admission to the Lord's Table, or no?</HI> Such as are serious would fain act in this Mat∣ter as they ought to do. They desire to ap∣prove themselves to God, with Respect to this important Case, <HI>Have I a Right to the Lord's Supper, or not?</HI> Or, which is the same Thing, <HI>Am I born again,</HI> or <HI>am I in a State of Nature?</HI> Many a one may here truly say, I have often examined myself, and yet cannot determine this great Question. And indeed we have Reason to think▪ <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> there are but few com∣paratively of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Children of God, that are able, satisfacto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly to resolve themselves in this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> very do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦lecting it. And thus these poor Creatures know not what to do on the Supposition I op∣pose. They know they believe the Truth of God's Word, Law, and Gosp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d know they desire to serve God and obt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y with him; but they do not know whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they do
<PB N="25" REF="004754_0027_100DE7A0B87D45F0"/>
these Things with a <HI>gracious Sincerity</HI> or not. There is such a Resemblance betwixt <HI>common</HI> and <HI>saving</HI> GRACE, that they know not whe∣ther they have the latter of these two, or no; and so know not what to do. It is not very likely that God should have made the Terms of Communion in his visible Church, such as necessarily do involve serious Professors of Re∣ligion in such Difficulties as these, as I have ob∣served in my first Proposition.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Principle which I argue against, seems to me to expose <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Churches</HI> to very <HI>great Difficulties,</HI> respecting those they should admit to the Ordinance of the Lord's Supper: For if none have any Right to the Lord's Supper, but such as are in a State of Grace, but will, if they partake of it, eat and drink Judgment to themselves, it seems to me, that they have a very difficult Task, who are obliged to judge whether such as offer them∣selves to their Communion are qualified for it, or not; and a Mistake in this Point may be of dangerous Consequence to the Persons admit∣ted, or denied; especially their Admission, if they are unfit, will be very dangerous.</P>
<P>If it be said <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>determine the Point <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Charity;</HI> I answer, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ty seems to be too uncertain and preca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous a Thing to Judge by, in a Case of so great Consequence, as wherein a Person's Soul is in great Danger. Grounds for Charity will admit of a great many Degrees: And it may be enquired, Whether those that are to judge of Men's spiritual State, according to this Rule, are to give their Sentence accor∣ding
<PB N="26" REF="004754_0028_100DE7A2730222D0"/>
to the highest or lowest Grounds for the Charity intended, or some of the intermediate ones; and if so, which of them? And I desire to know, who made them Judges of what God only can judge of? <HI>Jer.</HI> 17.10. I should think they must needs be in great Danger, lest they should be mistaken in this Affair, or have alrea∣dy been so, or lest they take upon them that which indeed is none of their Business.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is to be feared, that on the Hypothesis opposed, many may be <HI>hindred</HI> from Commu∣nion in special Ordinances, who have a <HI>good Right</HI> to them; and others <HI>admitted</HI> that have <HI>none.</HI> People being fixed in this Principle, That none but the Regenerate have a Right to special Ordinances many, even of those, who are very seriously concerned that they may approve themselves to God, being in great Doubt of the Sincerity of their own Hearts, are in all Likelihood hereby kept back from offering themselves to join in Church Commu∣nion. It is evident, that the more serious Per∣sons be, the greater Sense they have of the De∣ceitfulness and desperate Wickedness of their own Hearts, by Nature; and such as these are very apt to be proportionably doubtful of their own Sincerity. These feel and observe so much Corruption working in them, that they cannot easily perswade themselves of the In∣tegrity of their own Souls, and so dare not ven∣ture, in a long Time, if ever, to join themselves to the Church of Christ; and so <HI>the Church</HI> is hindred from having many Members, who are indeed, fit Matter for it, and <HI>such serious Souls,</HI> from the Advantages and Comforts, which they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ght otherwise enjoy.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="004754_0029_100DE7A695AF5888"/>On the other Hand, Persons far less religious and comparatively but little concerned for the Glory of God and the Salvation of their own Souls, and who think the Difficulties of Reli∣gion are nothing so great as others think them to be, can easily perswade themselves that they are true Christians, and are passed from Death to Life; being, as they think, born again. Such as these can, therefore, without any great Difficulty, offer themselves to the Communion of the Church; and thus great Numbers pro∣bably do while, on their own Principles, they are unqualified for it; and by this Means Churches are corrupted rather than kept pure and holy.</P>
<P N="4">4 I would ask this Question; Is there not some Danger, That, on the Principle I oppose, Persons submitting themselves to Examination, with Respect to the State of their Souls, in or∣der to their Admission to the Sacrament, may be very greatly hurt, either by having too fa∣vourable a Judgment passed on their Condition: or otherwise too severe a Sentence or Censure, with Respect to it? The Principle I argue a∣gainst, supposeth the Candidate, for Church-Priviledge to offer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Trial, with Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and the Principal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in this Trial, is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>under Examination b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, or he not in a converted Estate?</HI> And of this Question, the Elders and Brethren are the Judges If they judge him converted they admit him: It they think he offers no good E∣vidence of his Conversion they refuse him. Now it seem to me, That a Mistake in Judg∣ment,
<PB N="28" REF="004754_0030_100DE7A818C12C68"/>
here, if such a Mistake be committed, may greatly hurt the Person concerned in the Sentence, about whose Estate it is given. A suppose the Church should judge him to be <HI>converted,</HI> when indeed he <HI>is not;</HI> and thereup∣on admit him to their Communion; Will not this tend greatly to confirm the Man in the unhap∣py Mistake he is himself already under, who had not offered himself, if he had not hoped his Estate to be good: He will be very likely now to say in his Heart, I have Reason to be∣lieve that the Bitterness of Death is passed from me. I thought indeed before, that I was in a regenerate State, but now I have the Judgment of the Brethren and Elders of the Church in my Favour: Why then should I doubt of this When yet the poor Man is still in the Gall of Bitterness and in the Bond of Iniquity, as in <HI>Acts</HI> 8.23. And it is well if that be not his Case, in Isai. 44 20. <HI>He feedeth on Ashes, and a deceived Heart hath turned him aside, so that he cannot deliver his Soul, nor say, Is there not a Lie in my right Hand?</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand, Suppose the Person should be a <HI>sincere Convert,</HI> and yet the Elders and Church should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> still to be <HI>in a</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Communion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>vously to wound <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> weak Believer, and to <HI>break the brursed Reed, and quench the smoaking Flax,</HI> contrary to what our Saviour does, and would have his Ministers do, <HI>Matth.</HI> 12.20.</P>
<P>I am afraid of such unhappy Consequences as I have now mentioned, and which seem to attend the Principle I oppose. Whereas if we
<PB N="29" REF="004754_0031_100DE7AA717C6948"/>
allow a <HI>moral Sincerity</HI> in Men's <HI>Profession and Practice of Religion,</HI> to be sufficient to give them a <HI>Right</HI> to the Privileges of a Church State, we may tell them, we are not sufficient Judges of their spiritual Estate, so as to pass Sentence, whether they are converted or not; and that, as to this they must look to themselves, examine their own Hearts, and pray, as in Psal. 139.23, 24. <HI>Search m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, O God,</HI> &amp;c. And that they must by no Means think, that we judge them to be already in a regenerate State, from our admitting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f them to Church Com∣munion, for we receive them, not as already in a State of Grace and Salvation, but as Per∣sons, with a <HI>moral Sincerity,</HI> endeavouring to get into such an Estate, and unto that End, laying had on the Covenant: But whether they are converted or not, they themselves are the most proper Judges, and ought daily to ex∣amine themselves, and prove their own Hearts and Works, in order to their being able to de∣termine how it is with them.</P>
<P>This, <HI>Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> is the Truth of my present Tho'ts on the Point which you were pleas'd to ask my Opinion about; and which having, after my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Manner offered to you, I rest</P>
