<PB N="2" REF="001621_0003_0FB3E481C42589E8"/>Meditations. We will employ our Best <HI>Thoughts,</HI> to find out the way, that in <HI>that very Day,</HI> when we <HI>Dy,</HI> we may not <HI>Perish.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>History</HI> of the Psalm will give us the Intention of it, and of this Remarka∣ble Passage in it. When <HI>Cyrus</HI> had given the Jews Liberty to return unto <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> and rebuild the <HI>Temple,</HI> and restore the <HI>Worship</HI> of God, in that <HI>Holy City,</HI> the <HI>Samaritans,</HI> a mungril sort of People, so joined with their Adversaries, that little was done in it, notwithstanding the Fa∣vour which that Great Monarch had shown unto them. <HI>Cyrus</HI> was no sooner gone, and <HI>Cambyses</HI> on the Throne, but there seem'd an End of all Hope, that they should Proceed any further in their Desires. To prevent their <HI>Pear,</HI> &amp; Excite their <HI>Faith,</HI> on this Difficult occasion, those Two Great Prophets, <HI>Haggai</HI> and <HI>Zechariab</HI> appear; And probably One of those (for Antiquity is of this Opinion) composed the Psalm now before us. The Psalm Exhorts them to put their Trust in God. Accordingly <HI>Cambyses</HI> dies; <HI>Da∣rius</HI> comes to the Throne; <HI>Then,</HI> in spite of all opposition, the work of God goes on; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People accomplish what they had so
<PB N="3" REF="001621_0004_0FB3E483438F8F60"/>much and so long desired. When the <HI>Breath</HI> of that Crowned Head <HI>Went forth,</HI> and the Monarch <HI>returned unto his Earth,</HI> in <HI>that very Day,</HI> all the obstructions that had been given to the work of God, came to an <HI>End.</HI></P>
<P>We have before us, a <HI>Lively</HI> Descrip∣tion of <HI>Death;</HI> Even of the <HI>Death,</HI> which the Greatest, and the Wisest, and the Best of Men, must meet withal; Yea, <HI>Princes</HI> themselves, and the most Excellent among the <HI>Sons of Men.</HI> There have been <HI>Princes,</HI> that have been called, <HI>Gods.</HI> Indeed, there has been a mistake, in applying this, to all <HI>Princes</HI> and <HI>Rulers,</HI> in general. It seems to have been peculiar unto those of the <HI>Israelitish Theocracy.</HI> Tis true, if any in our Dayes, employ their <HI>Power</HI> for <HI>God,</HI> we may be content that they come in for a share in this Term of Honour. And yet, even these <HI>Earthly Gods,</HI> are but <HI>Gods of Earth.</HI> Alas, Let such <HI>Gods</HI> know, they are to <HI>Dy like Men.</HI> Those also that are peculiarly <HI>Men of God;</HI> Men full of GOD, and His most Glorious <HI>Temples</HI> in the World; Men that are the Heirs of <HI>Ever∣lasting Life;</HI> These must also <HI>Dy like other Men;</HI> and put off their <HI>Earthly Tabernacle.</HI>

<P>But, what befalls men when they <HI>Dye?</HI> Some Accidents of <HI>Mortality</HI> are here Spe∣cified. Let us make our Particular, — But, Oh! Let it be a profitable, Reflection on them.</P>
<P>First of all, you shall have them all, in <HI>One Collection.</HI></P>
<P><HI><HI>Of a Dring Man, it may be said,</HI> His Breath goes forth; <HI>and,</HI> He re∣turns to his Earth, and, His Thoughts Perish in the very Day, that he dies.</HI></P>
<P>You see My Friends, first, How a Man <HI>Lives;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is by his <HI>Breath.</HI> Secondly, How a Man <HI>Dies;</HI> Tis by his <HI>Breath go∣ing forth.</HI> Thirdly; What becomes of a Man, when he Dies.

The cor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inuance of <HI>Life,</HI> turns upon that; Job XXVIL. 3. <HI>All the while my Breath is in me, and the Spirit of God is in my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> There are cases, wherein the Children of Man h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve Sub∣sisted <HI>Breathl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s</HI> for some Hours, yea, for whole Dayes, and have our lived it.

<PB N="6" REF="001621_0007_0FB3E487B5E86A40"/><HI>Dead.</HI> We read; Jam. II. 26. <HI>The Body without the Breath, is Dead. Idols,</HI> when the Bible would call them <HI>Dead Things,</HI> it sayes, <HI>Neither is there any Breath in their Mouthes.</HI> Man is a <HI>Breathing</HI> Piece of <HI>Clay;</HI> and when he leaves off <HI>Breathing,</HI> he be∣comes <HI>Lifeless,</HI> and <HI>Senseless</HI> Clay. No longer than the <HI>Blood,</HI> wherein is <HI>the Life of Man,</HI> has the <HI>Air</HI> fanning and breaking of it, and Perhaps affording a Sort of a <HI>Balsame</HI> unto it, will the Soul continue in the <HI>Clay Tabernacle.</HI> The <HI>Vital Ty</HI> between the <HI>Soul</HI> and the <HI>Body,</HI> is in the <HI>Blood.</HI> The Texture and the Motion of the <HI>Blood</HI> is kept in due order by the <HI>Breath.</HI> When the <HI>Breath</HI> is totally check'd and the <HI>Blood</HI> can have no more of any refocillation from it, it stops, it coagulates, it putrifies; the <HI>Soul</HI> can stay no longer; its House is no longer tenantable.</P>
<P>But let us make some useful Remarks, on the most obvious Observation in the World.</P>
<P>First. With some Surprize, we may now make this Remark; How does every Man <HI>Dy Every Hour!</HI> His <HI>Breath goes forth,</HI> it may be, twenty times in an Hour. Truly, The Instrument of our <HI>Life,</HI> is the
<PB N="7" REF="001621_0008_0FB3E48AC0105F68"/>Harbinger and Monitor of our <HI>Death;</HI> Even, the <HI>Going forth of our Breath.</HI> My Friend, All thy <HI>Breathing,</HI> is but a <HI>Gosping for Life.</HI> A <HI>Breathing Life,</HI> 'tis at best but a <HI>Dying Life.</HI> Indeed, Our <HI>Breath</HI> which now <HI>goes forth,</HI> does again <HI>Return.</HI> But, <HI>when a few Dayes are past,</HI> it will go, <HI>whence it shall not Return.</HI> The Faculty of <HI>Breath∣ing,</HI> will ere long have a fatal <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>struction given to it. He was a Prudent Man, who said; I Cor. XV. 31. <HI>I die daily.</HI> Oh! Let every Man <HI>Breathing,</HI> Often with his <HI>Breath,</HI> fetch in such awakening Advice as this;
<Q>My <HI>Breach</HI> will certainly and speedily sail me My <HI>L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fe</HI> is going as well as my <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> my <HI>Breath</HI> will <HI>go forth</HI> for all together. My <HI>Breathing T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/></HI> wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tly be ever. No Man will have <HI>Power <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Breath,</HI> to <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Breath in the D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Death.</HI> O my Soul! What <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then <HI>Breath after</HI> so much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, that thou mayst be ready for thy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</Q></P>
<P>Secondly, There is this Remark to be now also made by every Man alive; What a poor thing is <HI>Man.</HI> What a Frail thing, the most <HI>Mighty Man<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> How little is the <HI>Life of Man</HI> to be depended on!
<PB N="8" REF="001621_0009_0FB3E48C84C5C570"/><HI>Trust not in any Son of Man,</HI> for this very cause; <HI>His Breath goes forth,</HI> and then the <HI>Man is gone.</HI></P>
<P>For a Man to depend on his <HI>own Life,</HI> tis a very Foolish Thing. We have that pungent Admonition given unto us; Jam. IV. 13, 14. <HI>Go to now, ye that say, to Day, or to Morrow, we will go into such a City, and continue there, a year, and Buy and Sell, and get Gain. What is your Life! It is even a Vapour that appeareth for a lit∣tle time and then vanisheth away.</HI> Even so; <HI>Go to now,</HI> ye that flatter your selves with <HI>Goods laid up for many years. Go to now,</HI> ye that promise, you will <HI>some years hence</HI> turn unto God. <HI>Go to now,</HI> ye that put off to <HI>another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ar</HI> those things, which ought imme∣diately to be performed <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is your Life?</HI> If your <HI>Breath go forth,</HI> you are <HI>Dead.</HI> Your <HI>Last Breath,</HI> who can say, how near it is? If that be <HI>Breathed out,</HI> you have no more opportunity to do any thing. <HI>Oh! Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st not of to Morrow: thou knowest not, what a Day may bring forth.</HI> And for a Man to depend on the <HI>Life of another Man</HI> is an equal Folly. To build a Weighty <HI>Hope,</HI> a Pompous
<PB N="9" REF="001621_0010_0FB3E48DA814D188"/><HI>Hope,</HI> on a <HI>Breath</HI> which is <HI>going forth!</HI> What better this, than to <HI>Build Castles in the Air?</HI> Thus we read, Isa. II. 22. <HI>Cease ye from Man, whose Breath is in his Nostrils: For wherein is he to be accounted of?</HI> Wo to that Man, who has <HI>no Friend,</HI> but a Man whose <HI>Breath</HI> is always <HI>going forth!</HI> A most uncertain and unstable <HI>Friendship,</HI> to subsist upon! Soul, Retire to the Glorious GOD, and say;
<Q>What can any <HI>Man</HI> do for me? If a little <HI>Breath</HI> fails, Lo, my <HI>Friend,</HI> and my <HI>Stay</HI> fails. Lord, my welfare is laid up in thy Favour. Thou art my <HI>E∣ver-Living Friend. Man</HI> will <HI>Dye.</HI> I will expect no more from any <HI>Man,</HI> than what is to be expected from a <HI>Dying Thing.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And then; If a <HI>Man</HI> be our <HI>Enemy,</HI> what need we be much <HI>Afraid</HI> of him? A Man whose <HI>Breath</HI> will soon fail him, and then his <HI>Wrath</HI> all comes to nothing. When the poor <HI>Animal Dies,</HI> then (as the <HI>Italians</HI> use to say upon a certain Occasion,) <HI>all his Malice is dead with him;</HI> Dead, that is, as to any mischief, that we may suffer from it. We are thus advised; Isai. LI. 12. <HI>I even I, am He
<PB N="10" REF="001621_0011_0FB3E48F401E49E8"/>that comforts you, who art thou, that thou shouldest be afraid of a Man that shall Die, and of the Son of Man, that shall be made as Grass.</HI> Tho' our Enemy, may <HI>Breathe out</HI> nothing but Fire and Fury against us; God can soon stop his <HI>Breath;</HI> He will soon be <HI>out of Breath.</HI> Poor Crea∣ture, what can he do! — He is not worth my taking any further notice of him! —</P>
<P>Thirdly. How much ought we to <HI>Fear,</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> and <HI>Serve</HI> the Glorious GOD! How much keep alive a conti∣nual Reliance on Him, and Resignati∣on to Him, in the <HI>Continuance of our Lives!</HI> It is the Demand; Psal. CL. 6. <HI>Let every Thing, that hath Breath, Praise the Lord.</HI> Every <HI>Breath</HI> we draw, there is in it, the <HI>Fav<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r</HI> of GOD. If GOD order our <HI>Breath</HI> to <HI>go forth,</HI> we are gone. All Men have this Dependence on GOD; <HI>Lord, Thou takest away their Breath, and they Die; and return to their Dust.</HI> Say then, If thou art in the Class of <HI>Reaso∣nables,</HI> now say; What is the best Em∣ployment thy <HI>Breath</HI> can be put unto? Surely, we ought to employ our <HI>Breath,</HI> in <HI>Speaking</HI> the <HI>Praises</HI> of God: Nothing,
<PB N="11" REF="001621_0012_0FB3E490AFD018D8"/>more proper to be Resolved upon, <HI>My Mouth shall Speak the Praises of the Lord!</HI> Surely, much of our <HI>Breath</HI> should be laid out in <HI>Prayer</HI> to God. Yea, we should be as unable to <HI>Live without Praying,</HI> as to <HI>Live without Breathing.</HI> Surely, we should beware of prostituting our <HI>Breath</HI> to the wrong use of any <HI>Evil-Speaking</HI> with it! The wretches who articulate their <HI>Breath</HI> into the horrid Language of Fiends; How worthy do they render themselves, that the GOD whom they Blaspheme should smite them with an Immediate <HI>Suffocation!</HI> And as with our <HI>Breath</HI> we should <HI>Bless God, even the Fa∣ther,</HI> Even so, we should be careful that we do not <HI>Curse Men, who are made after the Similitude of God:</HI> No, But Study, that our <HI>Breath</HI> may be the vehicle of Truth and of Good unto them, and of what may <HI>Feed</HI> them, and <HI>Minister Grace unto them.</HI> And since we <HI>Live</HI> no longer than GOD indulges our <HI>Breath</HI> unto us, Oh! Let us take heed of the <HI>Sins</HI> that may provoke Him to take away our <HI>Breath.</HI> Urged unto any wicked Thing, say, <HI>Never while I Breathe, will I do such a Thing!</HI> Let us particularly Take heed
<PB N="12" REF="001621_0013_0FB3E49311027248"/>of <HI>Living Unfruitfully.</HI> They who Live to no <HI>Good purpose,</HI> do forfeit their <HI>Lives.</HI> To <HI>what purpose</HI> can it be desired, that God should prolong their <HI>Lives!</HI></P>
<P>In fine; It was a sharp Rebuke, — Oh! take heed of deserving to be so re∣buked; Dan. V. 23. <HI>The God, in whose hand thy Breath is, and whose are all thy wayes, thou hast not Glorified.</HI> Sirs, <HI>Glorify</HI> GOD, as the Giver of your <HI>Breath.</HI> And, <HI>To Glorify God,</HI> Let this be the main End of your <HI>Breathing,</HI> and of all that you do, as long as you <HI>Breathe. Breathe</HI> after nothing so much as this, nothing but in Subordi∣nation to this; <HI>Oh! that I may but ac∣knowledge GOD in all my wayes; the GOD, in whose Hand are all my wayes.</HI> And, <HI>Live</HI> by <HI>Faith</HI> as well as by <HI>Breath.</HI> Maintain your Dependence on GOD, for your <HI>Breath. Acknowledge</HI> Him, in that agreea∣ble Style, <HI>The God of my Life!</HI></P>
<P>I will take advantage, from the phrase of, <HI>Breath in the Nostrils,</HI> to press your Du∣ty upon you. Tis the phrase, by which we have the <HI>Anger</HI> of the Great GOD set forth sometimes unto us. <HI>His Breath is in His Nostrils.</HI> Verily, If you do not lay out much of your <HI>Breathing Time,</HI> in
<PB N="13" REF="001621_0014_0FB3E4948437BE10"/>the <HI>Acknowledgments</HI> of GOD, you will find, His dreadful <HI>Anger,</HI> putting an End unto this <HI>Time,</HI> and punishing you, where the <HI>Breath of the Lord, like a Stream of Brimstone,</HI> does kindle a <HI>Fire,</HI> that burns unto Eternity.</P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> When a Man <HI>Dies,</HI> then he <HI>Re∣turns to his Earth. Dying,</HI> is a <HI>Returning to the Earth,</HI> yea, to a Mans <HI>Own Earth.</HI></P>
<P>The Phrase of, <HI>Returning to the Earth,</HI> leads us back to the <HI>Original</HI> of Man. For <HI>The Lord God formed Man out of the Dust of the Ground.</HI> This is the <HI>Humiliation</HI> which we have to take notice of; Gen. III. 19. <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u shalt Return to the Ground; for out of it, thou wast taken: For Dust thou art, and unto Dust shalt thou Return.</HI></P>
<P>We will Enquire; First; <HI>What</HI> of the <HI>Dying Man</HI> is it, that <HI>Returns to the Earth?</HI></P>
<P>In one Word; So much of <HI>Man,</HI> as <HI>came out of the Earth.</HI> And therefore, not the <HI>whole of Man;</HI> therefore no more than the <HI>Body of Man.</HI> The <HI>Body</HI> of Man, is of an <HI>Earthly Constitution.</HI> It was first lodg'd in the <HI>Earth.</HI> And the <HI>Nourish∣ment</HI> of it, is fetch'd from the <HI>Earth.</HI> Tis this, that is to find a lodging in the <HI>Earth,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="001621_0015_0FB3E496008EEDD8"/>when the <HI>Earth</HI> is no longer to nourish it, and sustain it, and recruit it. There is a <HI>Spirit</HI> in Man, which will not <HI>Return to the Earth,</HI> but go another way. We read, Eccl. XII. 7. <HI>The Dust shall return to the Earth, as it was; and the Spirit shall return unto God, who gave it.</HI> When the <HI>Body Returns unto the Earth,</HI> our Nobler Part goes to the <HI>Abdita animarum Receptacula,</HI> as <HI>Austin</HI> expresses it, the <HI>Hidden Recepta∣cles of Souls,</HI> which are <HI>with God.</HI> When we <HI>Die,</HI> then our <HI>Life,</HI> that is, our Soul, the Spring of our <HI>Life,</HI> and that part that shall never <HI>Die,</HI> this will be <HI>bid with God.</HI> But the <HI>Body,</HI> this is to be laid in the <HI>Grave.</HI> The <HI>Grave</HI> is the <HI>House of all the Living.</HI> When we cease to <HI>Live,</HI> our <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy</HI> is laid in the Dark and Cold House of the <HI>Grave.</HI> The <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy</HI> must be laid in that <HI>Pit of Corruption.</HI> Tis in <HI>Bondage to Corruption; Bound</HI> to be laid where it must undergo <HI>Corruption.</HI> There it must be crumbled and mouldred into <HI>Dust.</HI> And whence this Destruction, upon this curi∣ous <HI>W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kmanship of God;</HI> a Body so cu∣riously, and <HI>Fear<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lly, and Wondrously <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>?</HI> We may say; <HI>An Enemy has <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this.</HI> But what <HI>Enemy?</HI> SIN, SIN,
<PB N="15" REF="001621_0016_0FB3E497735DDB48"/>Thou art our <HI>Deadly Enemy.</HI> At the mention of thee, I may say, <HI>I have now found thee, O mine Enemy.</HI> The just Penalty of the <HI>Law,</HI> which the Great GOD gave unto us, is <HI>Death.</HI> By <HI>Sin</HI> we have <HI>Trans∣gressed the Law.</HI> In that <HI>Sin</HI> we hearkened unto the <HI>Tempter;</HI> The <HI>Breath</HI> of the <HI>Old Serpent,</HI> we so took in, as to be <HI>Poisoned</HI> with it. So tis, that our <HI>Breath</HI> comes to fail us, as it does. We see none <HI>Return∣ing to the Earth,</HI> but we may say, <HI>Behold, the Desolations that Sin has brought upon the Earth! Here is a part of the Hurt which our Sin has done unto us. Ah! Sin, Thou cause of our Death; what cause have we to count this more Bitter than Death? How can we Entertain Light Thoughts of so great an Evil!</HI></P>
<P>We will enquire; Secondly: What we have hinted unto us, in this, that the Dying Man must Return to <HI>His Earth?</HI></P>
<P>These things. First. A Dying Man is left Owner of nothing in this World, ex∣cept one may say, that little Piece of <HI>Earth,</HI> which he <HI>Returns</HI> unto. Tis very Remarkable; The <HI>Princes of this World;</HI> the Men who would have the <HI>Earth given to them alone;</HI> Even the <HI>Mighty Men</HI> who <HI>have the Earth,</HI> and the <HI>Honourable Men</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="001621_0017_0FB3E498F76BAEE0"/>who <HI>dwell in it;</HI> Of such as these, it is here said, <HI><HI>He returns to</HI> His Earth.</HI> It is not said, They <HI>return</HI> to their <HI>Castles,</HI> to their <HI>Cities,</HI> to their <HI>Kingdoms.</HI> No, These are now, <HI>Anothers.</HI> They <HI>return to their Earth,</HI> because a little <HI>Earth,</HI> is now all that is left unto them. We read, 1 Tim. VI. 7. <HI>We brought nothing into this World, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.</HI> Well known is the Story of that Great Empe∣rour <HI>Saladine,</HI> who would have it Pro∣claim'd at his Funeral; <HI>A Death Shrowd is all that the Great Emperor of the East, is now left Owner of!</HI> Man, Thy <HI>Death</HI> will dispossess thee, of all that thou hast in the World. It will only leave thee a few <HI>Clods of the Valley,</HI> or a little Turf upon the Hill of <HI>Golgotha,</HI> to be <HI>Sweet</HI> unto thee. He that was Possessor of many <HI>Acres,</HI> yea, of many <HI>Countries,</HI> must <HI>return</HI> to a Confine∣ment of <HI>Six Foot of Earth.</HI> He that was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r∣ray'd in <HI>Purple and fine Linnen,</HI> must <HI>Return</HI> to a close Chamber in the <HI>Earth,</HI> where he shall have no more than a <HI>Winding-Sheet.</HI> He that had his <HI>Chest</HI> full of the Shining <HI>Earth,</HI> which bewitches the Chil∣dren of Men into a <HI>Love</HI> of it, that is the <HI>Root of all Evil,</HI> must <HI>Return,</HI> where he shall
<PB N="17" REF="001621_0018_0FB3E49A8588EA78"/>be himself lock'd up in a <HI>Stable-Chest,</HI> without a penny of it. So we read; Psal. XLIX 16.17. <HI>One is made Rich, and the Glory of his House increased; when he Dies, he shall carry nothing away; his Glory shall not descend after him.</HI> It has been a Remark made on our Father <HI>Abrahams</HI> purchasing the Cave of <HI>Macpelah,</HI> That the first purchase of Land that ever we read of was of a <HI>Burying place.</HI> O you Eager purchasers of <HI>Land,</HI> and conten∣ders for it, and what it produces; The <HI>Burying-place</HI> is that, wherein all in a little while will terminate.</P>
<P>Secondly. Tis too Common a thing, for the <HI>Earth,</HI> to be all that the Dying Man has cared for, before and until he <HI>Return</HI> into it. It is <HI>His Earth,</HI> inasmuch as his care was to make it HIS. His <HI>whole care</HI> was to make sure of <HI>Earth.</HI> We read, Phil. III. 19. <HI>There are many, who mind Earthly Things.</HI> The most Men are <HI>Earthly-Minded Men;</HI> So they <HI>Live,</HI> and so they <HI>Die.</HI> They have chosen the <HI>Earth</HI> for their <HI>Portion.</HI> They know no Good, but what lies in <HI>Earthly Enjoyments.</HI> It is an Elegant pungency, with which the Children of Men are called upon, <HI>O Earth,
<PB N="18" REF="001621_0019_0FB3E49BF1559F98"/>Earth, Earth, Hear the word of the Lord.</HI> They have this Character assigned them, in the word of the Lord; Psal XVII. 14. <HI>They are the Men of the World, who have shew Portion in this Life.</HI> They are all for <HI>Earth</HI> while they <HI>Live;</HI> and so, they <HI>Re∣turn to their Earth,</HI> when they <HI>Die.</HI> The <HI>Curse</HI> of the <HI>Serpent</HI> is come upon the Children of Men, since they have been Seduced by the <HI>Old Serpent;</HI> they are un∣der that Vengeance of Heaven, <HI>Dust shalt thou Eat, all the dayes of thy Life.</HI> I will add, a terrible Gloss, which the Blessed Old <HI>Prosper</HI> had upon that Passage; Who are the <HI>Dust,</HI> but the <HI>Terrenis Cupiditatibus inhiantes Animae,</HI> The <HI>Souls</HI> that pant after nothing but <HI>Earth!</HI> Such <HI>Souls</HI> become the woful <HI>Food of the Serpent; Satan</HI> makes a prey of them; they fall into the mouth of that horrible <HI>Devourer.</HI> It will be so, when the <HI>Earthly minded</HI> wretch does <HI>Return to the Earth.</HI> And then, as I have been saying, it will be found, that his <HI>Earth</HI> is his <HI>All.</HI> A Covetous Tyrant, at his Death, had <HI>melted Gold</HI> poured into his Mouth, with such a Sarcasm as this upon him; <HI>Take now, what in thy Life∣time, thou wast alwayes unsatiably thirsting
<PB N="19" REF="001621_0020_0FB3E49D6F6024B0"/>for!</HI> Even so, when an <HI>Ungodly</HI> Man comes to Die, and the <HI>Covetous, whom the Lord abhors,</HI> he then <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eturns to his Earth,</HI> and it may be said unto him; <HI>Here thou hast that for which thou hast all the Dayes of thy Life been Labouring.</HI></P>
<P>This Observation will be followed with some Instructions.</P>
<P>First. What a wretched <HI>Vanity</HI> are they Guilty of, who are Sollicitous for no∣thing, but that they may with a little <HI>Earth,</HI> have a <HI>Body</HI> well-provided for! A∣las, the most of Men are Solicitous for nothing, but only to make <HI>Provision for the Flesh,</HI> and a <HI>Provision</HI> from the <HI>Earth;</HI> Solicitous for nothing, but only to have a <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dy</HI> well accommodated. Ridiculous Man! This <HI>Body</HI> is <HI>Returning to its Earth</HI> in a very little while. Tis impossible to keep the <HI>Body,</HI> from <HI>Returning to the Earth.</HI> Our Language indeed humours, the stu∣pid Notion, as if <HI>Man</HI> were nothing but <HI>Body.</HI> As I remember our Epigramma∣tist bestowes a little <HI>Satyr</HI> upon us for it. We say, <HI>Body</HI> for <HI>Person.</HI> And according∣ly Men generally consider nothing so much as their <HI>Body.</HI> But, Oh! the <HI>Mad∣ness</HI> of Leaving the <HI>Soul,</HI> all this while un∣considered!
<PB N="20" REF="001621_0021_0FB3E49F0023F708"/>We have been better taught than so; He, Like whom none teaches hath said unto us; Joh. VI. 27. <HI>Labour not for the Meat that perishes, but for that Meat, which Endures to Everlasting Life.</HI> Thus are we to be counselled. <HI>Labour more,</HI> to have thy <HI>Soul</HI> Fed, Cherished and Strengthened with the CHRIST, who is the <HI>Bread of Life,</HI> than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o get <HI>Food</HI> for thy <HI>Body,</HI> when <HI>Death</HI> is quickly to <HI>Feed</HI> up∣on. <HI>Labour more</HI> to have thy <HI>Soul</HI> ador∣ned with the <HI>Graces</HI> which are <HI>of Great price in the Sight of God,</HI> than to get <HI>Ornaments</HI> for a <HI>Body,</HI> which is quickly to be bury∣ed in lothsome Deformities. <HI>Labour more</HI> to have a <HI>Soul</HI> Entituled unto, <HI>An House Eternal in the Heavens,</HI> than to get a Splen∣did Lodging for a <HI>Body,</HI> that is quickly to be Imprisoned in a Subterraneous Habi∣tation. Tis a <HI>Madness</HI> to do otherwise; Oh! do not with this <HI>Madness</HI> uncured, <HI>go down unto the Dead!</HI> It was required; Isa. XLVI. 8. <HI>Show your selves Men.</HI> Veri∣ly, you do not <HI>show your selves Men</HI> until you come to this Determination;
<Q>My <HI>Body</HI> is <HI>Returning to the Earth.</HI> I will Sea∣sonably and Sollicitously <HI>give all Dili∣gence,</HI> that I may have something more than a little <HI>Earth,</HI> to befriend me in my
<PB N="21" REF="001621_0022_0FB3E4A075238018"/>greatest Necessities. There is a <HI>Better and a Lasting Substance in the Heavens,</HI> which is to my <HI>Soul,</HI> the <HI>One Thing that is Necessary.</HI> O my Soul, Awake; Em∣brace thy Saviour; Entreat Him to bring thee home unto God; and so <HI>lay hold on Eternal Life.</HI> The Man is <HI>Mad,</HI> who is not thus disposed, thus con∣cerned.</Q></P>
<P>Secondly. Tho' we <HI>Return to the Earth,</HI> yet let us Believe and Rejoyce in the Great Saviour, who will <HI>Redeem us from the Earth.</HI> Our Dear Saviour sayes unto His Faithful Ones, (like what He said unto our Father <HI>Jacob,) Be not afraid, my Child, of returning to thy Earth. I, that have my self been in the Grave, in the Belly of the Earth, and Risen again from thence, will be with thee, and surely bring the up again.</HI> That passage, which we render, <HI>Their Beauty shall consume in the Grave, from their Dwel∣ling,</HI> is to be read; Psal. XLIX. 14. <HI>Then shall their Rock come to destroy Death, He shall come from His Habitation.</HI> It follows [and so it well may!] <HI>God will Redeem my Soul from the Power of the Grave.</HI> This was the Ancient Faith; Job. XIV. 14, 15. <HI>If a Man Die, shall be Live again? All the
<PB N="22" REF="001621_0023_0FB3E4A1EE234F50"/>Dayes of my appointed Time will I wait unti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> my Change come.</HI> It means, the <HI>Change</HI> which Man shall see, when he rises from the Dead, and <HI>Lives again.</HI> Then, Lord <HI>Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee; Thou wilt have a Desire to the work of thine Hands.</HI> Even, to see a Restoration of the <HI>Body,</HI> which is a <HI>Work</HI> all full of <HI>Miracles!</HI> Ti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> true; The <HI>Resurrection</HI> is as great a Work, as <HI>Creation.</HI> Indeed, it is here intimated, That if Man be recovered after his <HI>Death,</HI> he must be fetched out of <HI>his Earth</HI> again. But then, he that <HI>made Man out of the Dust,</HI> can <HI>Raise Man out of the Dust.</HI> My Brethren, will you attend unto <HI>the Con∣solation?</HI> The Day is at hand, when the words of the Holy <HI>Daniel</HI> shall be accom∣plished; <HI>The many Sleepers in the Dust of the Earth shall awake;</HI> And when the words of the Holy <HI>Isaiah</HI> shall have their Accomplishment; <HI>They who dwell in the Dust, shall awake and Sing.</HI> But are there no Songs then, that we may <HI>go down to the Dust,</HI> and fall <HI>Asleep</HI> withall? Yea, there are <HI>Songs for that Night,</HI> where-with <HI>God our Maker</HI> has furnished us. That is one of the <HI>Songs;</HI> Psal. LXXI. 20. <HI>Thou who hast shewn me great and sore Troubles, wilt
<PB N="23" REF="001621_0024_0FB3E4A379B21888"/>fetch me to Life again, and wilt bring me up again from the Depths of the Earth.</HI> That is one of the <HI>Songs;</HI> Mic. VII. 8. <HI>Rejoyce not against me; O mine Enemy; when I fall, I shall arise; when I sit in Darkness, the Lord shall be a Light unto me.</HI> Oh! Let us go down <HI>Singing</HI> thus, unto the <HI>Place of Si∣lence;</HI> Assured of the <HI>Songs</HI> with which the <HI>Redeemed</HI> of the Lord shall <HI>return</HI> from thence; the <HI>Songs</HI> of never-ending <HI>Joy,</HI> and of a Return from the Land and the Hand, of our <HI>Enemy.</HI></P>
<P>But my Discourse is coming to an <HI>End:</HI> And the <HI>End</HI> of all, is the only re∣maining Article of it. There is but one <HI>Proposition</HI> more belonging to it.</P>
<P><HI>III. In that very Day,</HI> when our <HI>Lives</HI> come to an <HI>End,</HI> our <HI>Thoughts</HI> also come to an <HI>End.</HI> Our <HI>Death</HI> strikes at our <HI>Thoughts;</HI> and lays an Arrest upon them, in such Terms as those; Ezek. VII 6. <HI>An End is come, the End is come; it watcheth for you; behold it is come!</HI></P>
<P>The Thing to be now Enquired is; What <HI>Thoughts,</HI> will <HI>Perish,</HI> and <HI>come to an End,</HI> when we <HI>Return Breathless to the Earth,</HI> and our <HI>Breath</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> comes to <HI>an End?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="001621_0025_0FB3E4A4E96BAEF8"/>
Not, <HI>All Thoughts.</HI> Our Minds won't Leave off all <HI>Thinking,</HI> when we Leave off <HI>Breathing</HI> and <HI>Living</HI> here. The Opi∣nion of the <HI>Soul-s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>epers</HI> is an <HI>Idle Dream.</HI> If the <HI>Soul</HI> can't be <HI>Kill'd</HI> by the <HI>Death</HI> of the <HI>Body,</HI> then it will hold on <HI>Thinking,</HI> after the <HI>Body</HI> is <HI>Dead.</HI> But of the Things which <HI>Kill the Body,</HI> our Saviour has assu∣red us; Matth. X 28. <HI>They are not able to Kill the Soul.</HI></P>
<P>The Departed <HI>Soul</HI> of a <HI>Godly</HI> Man, will have his <HI>Thoughts.</HI> The Soul in the State of Separation fulfill that Word; Psal. LXIII. 6. <HI>I will Meditate on thee in the Night Watches.</HI> The <HI>Soul</HI> will feed on the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> in <HI>Thoughts</HI> on the Good Fruits, which a Divine Principle in it, brought forth, before its <HI>Transplantation</HI> into the <HI>Paradise</HI> of God. The <HI>Soul</HI> will be ravished with the <HI>Consolations of God,</HI> in the <HI>Multitude of its Thoughts</HI> on what the Saviour has done for him, and will do for him; and in most comfortable <HI>Visions</HI> of the Lord.</P>
<P>The Departed <HI>Soul</HI> of a <HI>Wicked</HI> man, will have his <HI>Thoughts</HI> too. We find it Spoken as to a Separate <HI>Soul</HI> of such an one; Luk. XVI 25. <HI>Son, Remember what
<PB N="25" REF="001621_0026_0FB3E4A66FB33E20"/>was in thy Life-time.</HI> The <HI>Conscience</HI> in a Criminal <HI>Soul,</HI> will with bitter, doleful, raging <HI>Thoughts,</HI> Look back on the vile Things he did in the Time of his Proba∣tion here. The <HI>Soul</HI> of such an one, will be thrown into inexpressible Anguish, by <HI>Thoughts,</HI> on the <HI>Fiery Indignation,</HI> where∣of he has a <HI>fearful Expectation.</HI></P>
<P>But then; First: A <HI>Dead</HI> man has done <HI>Thinking</HI> on such things as here take up the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of the most of men. All <HI>Projecting Thoughts</HI> for Things to be done in this World; these are all over; they <HI>Perish</HI> in <HI>that very Day,</HI> when we <HI>Dy,</HI> and leave the World. Thus we read, Eccl. IX 5, 6. <HI>The Dead know not any thing: Also their Love, and their Hatred, and their Envy, is now Perished; neither have they any more a Portion for ever in any thing that is done under the Sun.</HI> Whatever <HI>Thoughts</HI> we have, of becoming <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Great</HI> here, and of having our <HI>Houses</HI> made conside∣rable; now no more of those <HI>Thoughts;</HI> we have now for ever done with such <HI>Thoughts.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly: A <HI>Dead</HI> man, is gone, past all <HI>Hopes,</HI> to Execute any of his <HI>Thoughts.</HI> His <HI>Thoughts</HI> now <HI>Perish;</HI> inasmuch as his
<PB N="26" REF="001621_0027_0FB3E4A8ACC388A0"/><HI>Designs</HI> do so. If he has <HI>Contrived</HI> any thing to be done, the <HI>Contrivances</HI> are all defeated, in <HI>that very Day,</HI> when his <HI>Eyes</HI> are closed and his <HI>Hands</HI> can stir no more. Thus we read, Eccl. IX. 10. <HI>There is no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wisdom, in the Grave whither thou art going.</HI> What∣ever Plan we had laid in our <HI>Thoughts,</HI> tis now knock'd all to pieces: The pro∣posals in our <HI>Thoughts,</HI> are now laid all aside: The <HI>Thoughts</HI> are all Abortive, they miscarry, and they <HI>never see the Light.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly: The most of the <HI>Thoughts</HI> in the most of men, are found <HI>Mistakes,</HI> when they come to <HI>Dy.</HI> It is a Thunder-bolt hurled at the Head of an Impious man; Psal. L. 21, 22. <HI>Thou Thoughtest, I was al∣together such an One as thy self; But I will Correct thee. Consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver.</HI> An Infinitely Holy God may say to the Sinner, <HI>Thou thoughtest I would not punish thee for thy Sins.</HI> A Glorious <HI>Christ</HI> may say, <HI>Thou thoughtest there was no need of looking after an Interest in me.</HI> Ex∣ceeding Sinful <HI>Sin</HI> may say, <HI>Thou thoughtest me to have no great Evil in me.</HI> A <HI>sorry World</HI> may say, <HI>Thou thoughtest that I should afford
<PB N="27" REF="001621_0028_0FB3E4AA294527B0"/>a Satisfying Portion to thee.</HI> A Sinner in ill Terms with Heaven, has his presump∣teous <HI>Thoughts,</HI> that he shall go to Hea∣ven when he <HI>Dies,</HI> When <HI>Death</HI> comes, he is <HI>Torn to Pieces.</HI> Ay, and so are his <HI>Thoughts</HI> too. He <HI>Perishes,</HI> and all his <HI>Vain Thoughts Perish with him.</HI> His <HI>Thoughts</HI> are found woful Errors, and in <HI>that very Day,</HI> they <HI>Perish,</HI> with an Eternal Confu∣tation of them.</P>
<P>And now, in a few Admonitions re∣lating to this Observation, Let us <HI>bear the Conclusion of the Matter.</HI></P>
<P>First. What <HI>Thoughts</HI> you have, that you will Turn to God, and make sure of being Happy after <HI>Death;</HI> Oh! Let these <HI>Thoughts</HI> be accomplished before you <HI>Die;</HI> and therefore, importunately and imme∣diately prosecuted. The <HI>Thoughts</HI> of the Delaying Sinner, his <HI>Thoughts</HI> that he will One Day Turn, and Live unto God, by that <HI>Repentance</HI> which he now delays; <HI>In that very Day</HI> when he dies, these <HI>Thoughts</HI> all <HI>Perish;</HI> and so does he for his Leaving them so unfinished. A Sinner has his <HI>Thoughts</HI> of this Tendency, <HI>I will hereafter forsake my Sin, and accept my Saviour, and give my self up unto God; and will take a
<PB N="28" REF="001621_0029_0FB3E4ABAF7229F8"/>Convenient Season to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke my Calling and E∣lection sure. Death</HI> siezes on him, while these <HI>Thoughts</HI> are yet unperformed. Mi∣serable Sinners, Thy <HI>Thoughts</HI> are all <HI>Pe∣rished.</HI> There is no Room left for any more such <HI>Thoughts.</HI> Thy Lamentable cry may now be that; Job XVII. 11. <HI>My Dayes are past, my purposes are broken off even the Thoughts of my Heart.</HI> As it hath been said, <HI>They that go down to the Pit, cannot hope:</HI> So may it be said; <HI>In that very Day, when Men go down to the Pit, they cannot have any more Thoughts how to escape the Pit.</HI> It is <HI>too late</HI> now, to <HI>Think</HI> on that Great Question, <HI>What shall I do to be Saved?</HI> Wherefore, O <HI>Think</HI> presently what you have to do; Even before it be <HI>too late;</HI> and let your <HI>Thoughts</HI> be presently put in Execution. Come to that Issue; Psal. CXIX. 59 60. <HI>I thought on my wayes, and turned my feet unto thy Testimonies; I made haste, and I'd layed not, to keep thy Command∣ments.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; Be not misled into <HI>Thoughts</HI> which will <HI>Perish,</HI> as the <HI>Dreams</HI> of a mis∣guided <HI>Life,</HI> when you come to <HI>Dic.</HI> while men are Living, in the Midst, and in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d, of <HI>Worldly Amusements,</HI> they
<PB N="29" REF="001621_0030_0FB3E4AD2CAEA110"/>have many <HI>Thoughts,</HI> whereof we may say, <HI>They are a Multitude of Dreams, and in them there are diverse Vanities.</HI> They are <HI>Thoughts</HI> which make men to <HI>Perish;</HI> they <HI>drown</HI> Men <HI>in Perdition;</HI> and then the <HI>Thoughts</HI> themselves will <HI>Perish.</HI> Of these, we have that call of God unto us; Jer. IV. 14. <HI>How long shall thy vain Thoughts lodge within thee?</HI> What will be the <HI>Thoughts</HI> of a <HI>Dying Man?</HI> Of <HI>Sin,</HI> a Dy∣ing Man <HI>thinks; To Sin, Oh! tis to do an abominable Thing.</HI> Of a <HI>Saviour</HI> from Sin, a Dying Man <HI>thinks; To be found in Christ, Oh! nothing, nothing so desireable!</HI> Of <HI>Time,</HI> a Dying Man, who hears the Angel of Death Swearing, <HI>Time shall be no more;</HI> Such an one <HI>thinks Oh! the Unknown worth of Time! It cannot be better Spent, than in the diligent Service of God!</HI> Of this <HI>World,</HI> a Dying Man, who is taking his Leave of the <HI>World;</HI> such an one thinks, <HI>A most Undone Man is he, who is put off with a Por∣tion in such a dispicable-World!</HI> Of <HI>Religi∣on,</HI> or a Life Placed in Holy Essays to Se∣cure a Blessedness after Death; What are the <HI>Thoughts of a Dying Man?</HI> They are, <HI>'Tis Good for me to draw near unto God.</HI> My Hearets, Take up such <HI>Thoughts</HI> Now.
<PB N="30" REF="001621_0031_0FB3E4AEADF4B988"/>A <HI>Dying-Hour</HI> will <HI>Confirm</HI> these <HI>Thoughts,</HI> and not <HI>Confound</HI> them. They will not <HI>Perish in that very Day,</HI> but rather have a fresh <HI>Life</HI> given unto them. And while you cherish these <HI>Thoughts,</HI> you must har∣bour none but <HI>Right Thoughts</HI> about <HI>Your selves.</HI> It is a Warning from God; Gal.

<HEAD>A Short Memorial OF Mr. <HI>Recompence Wadsworth.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ONE of the Young Persons, whose <HI>Death</HI> gave <HI>Life</HI> to the foregoing SERMON, was Mr. <HI>Recompence Wads∣worth;</HI> Unto whose Memory it will be a piece of Justice, that a brief TESTI∣MONY be given, that may represent him, as One <HI>Worthy of Remembrance</HI> a∣mong the People of God.</P>
<P>He had an <HI>Academical Education,</HI> which brought him to the Laurels of our Two <HI>Degrees.</HI> His Friends designed him for the <HI>Evangelical Ministry;</HI> but his <HI>Genius</HI> led him rather to that Employment, which Educates other, to be <HI>Ministers;</HI> and a Place in the Tribe of <HI>Sinteon,</HI> rather than of <HI>Levi.</HI> He had performed the part of a <HI>School-Master</HI> in diverse Places, but was at length chosen, (and we thought, <HI>fixed,</HI>) the first Master of the <HI>Grammar School,</HI> Erected lately by a Ge∣nerous
<PB N="36" REF="001621_0037_0FB3E4B7BB83CB48"/>Benefactor to the Publick, in the North Part of <HI>Boston.</HI> We Promised our selves much Satisfaction in him; with <HI>Hopes,</HI> which the Early Stroke of <HI>Death,</HI> arresting him in the <HI>Twenty-fifth</HI> Year of his Age, has at once Extinguished.</P>
<P>That he may still do <HI>Some</HI> of that Good, whereof he was desirous to have done <HI>very much,</HI> and if he had Lived, no doubt, would have done, I will preserve a short <HI>Instrument of Piety,</HI> of his own hand-writing, which I have lying by me. It is a brief Declaration of his <HI>Faith,</HI> and <HI>Conversion,</HI> and <HI>Repentance,</HI> which he wrote, when he was about Seventeen Years of Age.</P>
<Q><P>I BELIEVE, <HI>that</HI> there is One Only, True GOD; the <HI>Father,</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> and the Holy <HI>Spirit;</HI> which are Three Distinct Persons and Each of them GOD, and all of them, One and the same GOD: And this GOD, is the Fore-Ordain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Creator, Preserver and Go∣vernour of all Things, according to the Counsel of His Will. <HI>That</HI> God made Man <HI>Upright,</HI> after His own Image; In Knowledge Righteousness, &amp; Holiness: But he transgressing the Law of His
<PB N="37" REF="001621_0038_0FB3E4B935237460"/>Maker, fell from that Holy and Happy State, and brought himself, with his whole Posterity, into a State of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Death. That</HI> Man thus fallen, being unable to deliver himself from this Miserable State, God so Loved the World as to give His only Begotten Son, JESUS CHRIST; who gave Himself a Sacrifice for our Sins, and became a Ransome for us, by Suffering the Wrath of God, and the Death of the Cross, to Reconcile us un∣to GOD; and tho' He was Dead and Buried, yet He so triumphed over Death, that He Rose again on the Third Day ▪ and afterwards ascended into Heaven, where He now remains, Ruling in E∣qual Power &amp; Glory with the Father; and makes Intercession for us; But He will Come from thence at the Day Ap∣pointed, and Judge the World in Righ∣teousness; I believe, <HI>that</HI> God the <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Spirit</HI> hath fully Revealed the Truth and Will of God, contained in the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament the per∣fect and perpetual Rule of Faith &amp; Obe∣dience; And <HI>that</HI> He d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>tually Apply to His Elect, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> them the Saving Bene<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Redemption
<PB N="38" REF="001621_0039_0FB3E4BAE5009478"/>Purchased by the Blood of our Sa∣viour; which precious Benefits are dis∣pensed by the same Spirit, in the Use of those Holy Ordinances which our Lord has Instituted in His Written Word, for the Begetting &amp; Perfecting of Grace, to be carefully Observed, until His Second Coming: And <HI>that</HI> this Holy Spirit dwelleth &amp; worketh in all, who are drawn to Believe in Christ; who being United unto Him the <HI>Head,</HI> make up one Ca∣tholick Church, which is His Body; the Members whereof, having Fellow∣ship with the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, by Faith, and with one another in Love, do receive here on Earth, Forgiveness of Sin with the Life of Grace; and at the last shall receive a Resurrection of their <HI>Bodies;</HI> and shall for ever Enjoy the Life of Glory with God in Heaven when the wicked shall go into Everlasting Punishment.</P>
<P>I desire to bless God, while I was Young, I was not only <HI>Baptised,</HI> but also faithfully instructed in the wayes of the Christian Religion. That Instruction indeed had at first no more Effect upon me, than to keep me from gross and
<PB N="39" REF="001621_0040_0FB3E4BC31D79520"/>scandalous Sins. God was pleased some∣times to Visit me with Sickness, which to∣gether with the Fear of Death, would put me upon Praving to Him. And yet this was also but after a formal manner. When my Fear of Death left me, my Praying Frame also left me. I seldome thought of getting an Interest in Christ, but minded the World more than Real Re∣ligion. When one of my Relatives told me, what great Obligations I was under, to give my self up unto Christ, &amp; honour Him with an Open Profession of Him, God was pleased to set this home upon my Heart. And reading a Book, Enti∣tuled, <HI>Contemplations on Eternity,</HI> I saw with more awakened Thoughts, that I had but a Little Time to be here, &amp; that I had a Great Work to do, and that it would be infinitely worth my while to get an Interest in my Saviour here, and so have an Eternity of Happiness here∣after. I have been often times perplexed concerning my Eternal Welfare; and often full of Doubts &amp; Fears, whether I should be Saved &amp; whether the Holy One would be willing to Save Such a Sinful Creature. I have sometimes almost run
<PB N="40" REF="001621_0041_0FB3E4BDCB6F4AB8"/>into Despair; But then, I have cried unto God, and begged of Him, that He would help me to Repent of my Sin, and Believe on my Saviour. And the Lord has heard me; and brought much Comfort into my Soul. Especially in helping me, to call to Mind that Scripture; <HI>Come unto me, all ye that Labour &amp; are heavy-laden, &amp; I will give you Rest.</HI> And from that Word, <HI>God sent His Son into the World, not to Con∣demn the World but that the World thro' Him might be Saved:</HI> God helped me to see how willing the Glorious Redeemer is, to Save Poor Sinners; and I was Encou∣raged to come &amp; cast my self upon Him, and Rely, upon Him alone for Salvation.</P>
<P>I saw, that I who now durst not live in any known Sin &amp; who would not live in the Omission of any known Duty, yet really did so while I neglected a due ap∣proach unto the <HI>Table of the Lord.</HI> Where∣fore, inasmuch as not only the Commands of God in His Word, have often called me to give my self, Soul &amp; Body, up unto Him, but also the <HI>Christian Religion</HI> which I profess &amp; my <HI>Baptism,</HI> in which I took the Lord to be my God, &amp; Renounced the Flesh &amp; the World &amp; the Devil &amp; came under a Ded<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="41" REF="001621_0042_0FB3E4BF678C7B30"/>Work &amp; Will of the Glorious Lord, bind me here-unto; And since my felicity hereafter depends upon my now Dedi∣cating of my self unto God; And that so, when I come to dy, I may find nothing undone, that I should have done, I would in the presence of God, &amp; his Holy An∣gels, give my self up unto Him, and joyn my self unto His People.</P>
<P>My Desire is, That I may have my Sa∣viour more Endeared unto my Soul; my Heart Softened; my Sin Subdued; my Faith Strengthened; my Evidences Cleared; and my Soul assured of Eternal Life.</P></Q>
<P>And he is doubtless now gone, where this <HI>Holy Desire</HI> (which <HI>Austin</HI> well sayes, is the <HI>Life of a Christian,</HI>) is most fully, and in a most glorious manner answered; as our Gracious God uses to <HI>fulfil the Desire of them that fear Him.</HI></P>
<P>Tho' this <HI>Comprehensive Instrument,</HI> be that which I have chosen to Exhibit as the First Article of the Things which I extract from his more Private <HI>Memoirs,</HI> yet I find some other Passages in them, which I am willing to have Remembred.</P>
<P>In the Year, 1704 I find this Memorial en∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by him in his private Papers;</P>
<P><Q>Aug. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I was Admitted into <HI>Harvard</HI> Col∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> have I been! I
<PB N="42" REF="001621_0043_0FB3E4C0AB47D198"/>have done nothing for God. Oh! that God would now help me to be Studious, not only to get <HI>Humane Learning,</HI> but that I may be <HI>Wise unto Salvation.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And yet for some time after this, he laid a∣side the sense which he had thus begun to en∣tertain of his true Interest, and indulged those vanities, from which in about a Year after this, the Glorious Grace of God so remarkably reco∣vered him, that the serious and solid and thoughtful Frame, into which he was changed, was a matter of Observation.</P>
<P>Ere he had been Two Years a Student at the Colledge, he had made a more sensible progress in that <HI>Wisdom.</HI> Then I find an Instrument written and signed by him, Sept. 21. 1706. Wherein he Renewed his consent unto the COVENANT of God &amp; of Grace; and with all solemnity recapitulating the various Obliga∣tions that lay upon him to do so, he did <Q>Ac∣cept &amp; Avouch the Glorious JEHOVAH to be His God; and Embrace a Lovely JESUS, as the way to come unto the Enjoyment of Him; and Renounce the Service of Sin, and Resolve to Watch against the Temptations that might invite him unto it; and subscribe to the Laws of the only Saviour as all of them Holy and Just and Good.</Q> On this Transaction he afterwards made a frequent Reflection in the course of his Life, to quicken his care of <HI>Holi∣ness in all manner of Conversation.</HI></P>
<P>While he lived at the Colledge, he associa∣ted with a considerable Number of the Under∣graduate
<PB N="43" REF="001621_0044_0FB3E4C22E8BC968"/>Students there, in a practice which very much befriended the Interests of Piety in themselves, and which all the more considerate Friends of Piety will doubtless be so much the <HI>Children of Wisdom</HI> as to <HI>Justify.</HI> They form∣ed a <HI>Society,</HI> which laying to heart the too gene∣ral <HI>Decay of serious Piety</HI> in the Professors of it, resolved upon Essayes to <HI>speak <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> one unto a∣nother,</HI> and in the sweetest methods of <HI>Bretherly Love</HI> watch over one another, and carry on some suitable Exercises of Religion together, where∣in they might prove Blessings not only unto one another, but unto many more whom they might be concerned for. In this their <HI>Association,</HI> ha∣ving first come into the Resolutions of <HI>Living by the Faith of the Son of God,</HI> and as becomes those whom He has <HI>Redeemed from a vain Conversation,</HI> and of maintaining a Just &amp; Meek. &amp; Charitable Carriage, towards their <HI>Neighbours,</HI> they enga∣ged all possible Kindness to one another, and to increase their Number as far as the Rules of Prudence &amp; Goodness, might lead them to it. On the <HI>Evenings</HI> of the <HI>Lords Dares,</HI> they met, and Pray'd together, &amp; Read Instructive Trea∣tises, and communicated unto each other their Thoughts on proper Subjects &amp; Sing the Prai∣ses of God. On <HI>Saturday<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> before the <HI>Communi∣on,</HI> they spent the Afternoons together, in pre∣paring for the Interviews with Heaven, which they had before them. And sometimes they spent <HI>whole Dayes</HI> in Prayer with Fasting before the Glorious God; particularly to obtain Blessings for the <HI>Colledge</HI> whereof they were the
<PB N="44" REF="001621_0045_0FB3E4C3C71E3460"/>Members. This Action has been very sensibly blessed of God, for the advantage of them that combined in it; and this Young Man in parti∣cular, was one who found the desirable Effect of it, on himself, the rest of his little Time in the World. He was after this, very solicitous about answering the Characters of, <HI>An Upright Christian;</HI> which therefore he found out, and wrote out; Especially from the Excellent <HI>Scud∣ders</HI> Treatise of, <HI>A Christians Daily walk.</HI> And for his own <HI>Walk</HI> he made a Collection of Scrip∣tures, which contained, <HI>Rules</HI> for his <HI>Affections,</HI> &amp; his <HI>Thoughts,</HI> &amp; his <HI>Words,</HI> &amp; his <HI>Works.</HI></P>
<P>He drew up a short <HI>Catalogue</HI> of things under this Title; <HI>Sins, which I think, I should most bewayl, and ask pardon for, if I were now to Dye.</HI></P>
<P>And another under this Title; <HI>The Graces, which I should pray to God for, if I were now to Dye.</HI></P>
<P>He has also left Notes, which discover his con∣cern to uphold an <HI>Examination</HI> every Night upon those Three Articles.</P>
<P>Q. 1 <HI>What has been the Mercy of God unto me this Day?</HI></P>
<P>Q. 2 <HI>What has been my Carriage towards God this Day?</HI></P>
<P>Q. 3 <HI>If I Dye this Night, am I in a state of safety for Eternity?</HI></P>
<P>That he might improve in universal Knowledge, and Enrich his mind with the Labours of a Diligent Hand, he had his <HI>Quotidiana;</HI> or Blank Books, wherein he entered the more notable things that occur'd unto him in his Reading: and still num∣bring of the <HI>Notata,</HI> he formed an Index of them, that he might readily turn unto them In such imitable wayes, he held on, preparing for the <HI>Death;</HI> which has now bereaved us of him.</P>

I fear I should have chosen my Diversions But God and a great Work to do in me &amp; for m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> how rich how won∣derful is the Grace of God! Wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st they were Engaged in Dety, I did little else but Laugh be∣hind the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s I came away not the better, but the worse: had not the Grace of God over-ruled. (O my Soul, Behold &amp; Admire the
<PB N="46" REF="001621_0047_0FB3E4C6B170FF68"/>Good Hand of my God upon me!) Soon after, I overheard two or three Censuring me for my Indecent Atheistic Carriage, and my Heart in∣stantly Smote me O see, how the Stratag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms of Satan sometimes thro' Grace become the means of Salvation! He designed it for Evil; but the Grace of God over-ruled it to my Everlasting Welfare: Thus the Good Work began, and my Repentings were kindled together. My Heart burned within me! One of my Companions was so faithful to me, as to Reprove me Seriously, and Speak to me affectionately about another World: And the Spirit of God Set in with the kind Ad∣monitions; Every Expression came with Power: Forthwith I resolved to set on the Great Work of Salvation. O see, my Soul, what God can do? <HI>Out of the Mouthes of Babes &amp; Sucklings He ordaineth Strength, to still the Enemy and the Avenger.</HI></P>
<P>That which helped on the Good Work, was the Good Company I had. It pleased God at this very time, to work upon the Consciences of al∣most all our Class; who had all a very great Concern upon us, for our own, and One anothers Souls, our Precious &amp; Immortal Souls. We had each others Examples &amp; Prayers to help on One another to Heaven &amp; Glory. O how Sweet was it, to talk with my Companions, of an Everlasting State! How much was I affected with their Dis∣courses! Thus we walked together as Brethren, Edifying One another, and drawing One another nearer &amp; nearer to God in a way of Duty Good Examples are good Guides to Heaven!</P></Q>
<P>I hope, there will be some Good Effect of the Passage which I have thus transcribed, as well as of the whole Discourse which it now belongs unto.</P>
