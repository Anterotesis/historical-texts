<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ordinance of Mar∣riage.</NOTE>IN the next Place, we are to shew what our Principles are con∣cerning that holy Ordinance of Mar∣riage, which may be reduced to these three Particulars.</P>
<P>FIRST we ought not to mar∣ry with those who are out of the Belief and Profession of the blessed <HI>Truth as it in Jesus,</HI> or being of another Judgment or Fellowship, or pretending to the Truth, or ma∣king Profession thereof, walk not in some good Degree answerable there∣unto.</P>
<P>SECONDLY, we ought not to marry by the Priests, who take upon them to join People in Mar∣riage without any Command from
<PB N="39" REF="002411_0038_0FDB3DA638DADEE0"/>
the Law of God, or Precedent, or Example from the holy Scripture for so doing.</P>
<P>THIRDLY, We ought not to suffer such kind of Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ages to pass among us, which as to the De∣grees of Consanguinity, Affinity, or which by Reason of Precontract or otherwise, are in themselves unlaw∣ful, or from which they may be a∣ny just Reflection cast upon our Way.</P>
<P>AS to the first,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ying with these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f diffe∣rent Per∣swasion.</NOTE> we say, that if such as make Profession with us, and believe in the Light, and own the Doctrines and Principles of Truth, concerning the Spiritual Appearance and Manifestation of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, should marry with such as do not so profess and believe, or with such as profess the Truth, and walk not in some good Degree answerable thereunto, we cannot have Unity with such Marriages.</P>
<P>But if any should think it strange that we dislike joining in Marriage
<PB N="40" REF="002411_0039_0FDB3DAA0F934630"/>
with those that are not of our Pro∣fession,<NOTE PLACE="marg">R. B. 210.

for Brevity we omit; and shall only mention a Cause which our honourable Friend and elder Bro∣ther <HI>George Fox</HI> in his <HI>Journal,</HI> p. 249. said was tried in the Assizes at <HI>Nottingham</HI> in the Year 1661.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Law-Case.

<P><PB N="43" REF="002411_0042_0FDB3DB0C5657C28"/>BY this we may understand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Our Me∣thod of marrying.</NOTE> how far we are justified in the Me∣thod of consummating our Mar∣riages by mutual Promises, which are made with much Awe and Re∣verence, in the Presence and Audi∣ence of God's People, at their reli∣gious Assemblies. But it is to be understood, that tho' we are pre∣sent at such Solemnities, yet we marry none, but are Witnesses there∣unto,<NOTE PLACE="marg">We merry none.</NOTE> as any other Spectators may be.</P>

<P>WE do not in the least suppose, by what we object against marrying by the Priest,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mar∣riages by Priests or others not supposed void.</NOTE> or others differing from our Way, as if their Marriages were void; neither do we take upon us to hinder any to marry otherwise than by tenderly advising such as are like to go contrary to our Dis∣cipline, and if they reject our Ad∣vice, we refuse to be Witnesses and Concurrers with them, and if they go right, and make regular Steps in

their Procedure, to the Satisfaction of the Meetings whereto they be∣long, we allow them to consummate their Marriages according to the good Order and Method which our Fathers and Elders in the Truth, did at first establish in the Wisdom and Power of God.</P>

formerly did speak neither to Father nor Mother, till they had drawn out and entangled the Affections of the Daughter, and that brought great Troubles and Discontents up∣on the Parent, and amongst Friends.

<P>AND where Men and Women draw out the Affections one of ano∣ther, and after a while go to others,<NOTE PLACE="marg">G. F. <HI>Ep.</HI> 281.</NOTE> and then do the like, this ought to be censured as a scandalous Practice.</P>
