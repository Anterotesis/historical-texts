<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 CHRONICLES xxix, 28.</HI></BIBL>
<P>And he died in a good old Age, full of Days, Riches, and Honor; and <HI>Solomon</HI> his Son reigned in his Stead.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N these Words, we have an Account of the respectable Circumstances, with which <HI>David,</HI> the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> concluded his useful Life and Reign.</P>
<P>IN discoursing upon which, I shall offer some Considerations respecting the <HI>Nature, Cause,</HI> and <HI>Aspect</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> upon the present and future Life; tending to repesent its Solemnity, and the Necessity and Importance of Preparation for it, and so proceed to the Improvement.</P>
<P>DEATH is the <HI>Dissolution</HI> of the <HI>Union</HI> between Soul and Body, upon which our animal Life depends, and tho' we have no Reason to conclude, that the Life of our Soul is hereby annihilated; yet if we consider human Nature as compounded of Soul and Body, Death may be, in some Sense, said to be the visible Destruction of it, because it reduces all of Man, that is visible, to deplorable Ruins! Reduces the active Creature full of anxious Thoughts, big
<PB N="6" REF="009023_0004_1030749C64488B30"/>
with great Projects and Designs, and laborious in the Pursuit of them, to a breathless Mass, a ghastly Spectacle, devoid of Beauty and of Motion, which to prevent being offensive, must soon be hid in the dark and silent Retreat of the Grave, and become the Prey of Worms.</P>
<P>HOW this vital <HI>Union</HI> is dissolved, we know no more than how it is formed; that Beings of so vastly different Natures as the Soul and Body are, should be closely united is amazing, yet the Union appears to be as certain as it is astonishing, from their Sympathy with, and Influence upon each other.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time this is apparent, that Death in its near Approaches, generally offers Violence to the Frame of Nature; tho' in some Instances, the Lamp of Life expires gently and gradually, like a Candle in the Socket; yet, in most, human Nature does not yield to the last Enemy without Reluctance, which as it manifests its deep Aversion to Death, so it proves Death to be the Shipwreck of Nature: Our vital Parts being torn by the Violence of Diseases, as a Vessel by the Rage of a Tempest, before it sinks into the Abyss of the Grave!</P>
<P>BUT whence is it that Death puts a Period to our present Existence, shall we ascribe this entirely to the sovereign Pleasure of the supreme Being, which without any regard to our Demerit, has subjected our Nature to such Mortality and Corruption? No! the sacred Scriptures assert Death to be a <HI>penal Evil,</HI> issuing not from the meer Sovereignty, but the Justice and Righteousness of God.</P>
<P>THO' Immortality was no Privilege that innocent Man could claim, by the original Right of his Nature; yet it was graciously promised as the Reward of his Obedience: It is
<PB N="7" REF="009023_0005_1030749EC0DC69C8"/>
true, the human Body was formed of the Dust, and that this is not so adapted to an immortal Life as the Soul, and therefore could only obtain and enjoy it by way of Gratuity, thro' the powerful Agency of a particular Providence.</P>
<P>THE Almighty to excite Man to Obedience, promised this supernatural Privilege, and to deter him from the Contrary, threatened Death as the Punishment of Sin: Which necessarily supposes, that it would not have been his Lot, had he persisted in his Obedience to his Creator and Sovereign: And hence the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> assures us, that <HI>The Wages of Sin is Death;</HI> and elsewhere, that <HI>By one Man Sin entered into the World, and Death by Sin, and so Death passed upon all Men, for that all had SINNED:</HI> How? Virtually, in their federal Head the first <HI>Adam;</HI> it was therefore at this Door, that Death and all its preceeding Train of Diseases and Miseries, has broke in upon and entirely inundated this lower World, whereby it is rendered a Vale of Tears, a Scene of Woe: And indeed it is congruous both to Reason and Justice, that the Empire of Death and Misery should be parallel in Extent with the Dominion of Sin, the one as universal as the other.</P>
<P>BUT what <HI>Aspect</HI> has this penal Evil, Death, upon the present Life? I answer, It may be said in general to be the End of it, it puts a final Period to the Drama of Life, whereby its shifting Scenes are quite shut up, and the Actors hurried off the Stage into a State of Inactivity and Darkness, just as in the dead of the Night, an entire stop is put to all the Business of the preceeding Day, and every Place of public Concourse wrapt up in solemn Silence and Obscurity!</P>
<P>BUT in particular, Death puts a Period to all our worldly <HI>Schemes</HI> and <HI>Labours,</HI> as well as to our <HI>secular</HI> State of <HI>Prosperity</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="009023_0006_103074A245E22A20"/>
and <HI>Adversity,</HI> together with the Seasons of <HI>Grace,</HI> and Opportunities of <HI>Service.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT is said of <HI>Princes</HI> may be applied to <HI>Peasants,</HI> that <HI>Their Breath goeth out, and in that very Day their Thoughts perish:</HI> While the <HI>Statesman</HI> is forming grand Projects, and imagines he has near compassed his Designs; Death, which constantly lies in Ambush, frequently, and suddenly crushes his Schemes, disappoints his Expectations, and blasts his Success: Death carries all off from the Theatre of Action, to the Prison of the Grave, where those, that a little while before, made a great Noise and Bustle, are locked up in a profound Sleep, out of which Nothing can awake them, but the loud Blast of the Archangel's Trumpet.</P>
<P>DEATH likewise puts a Period to our outward State, whether prosperous or afflicted; it concludes Prosperity by destroying Life, the Foundation of it, and hurries the grandest Potentates, from the Pomp of a Throne, to the Obscurity of the Grave, where no Traces of their former Grandeur appear, in the ghastly Remains of their Mortality, and the Places that knew them on Earth shall know them no more.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, Death concludes all the Evils of an afflicted State, this gives the Child of God a happy Discharge from all the Hardships of the Christian Warfare, and brings to a Period the Cruelty of Enemies, whose Rage can pursue us no further than the Grave, <HI>There the Wicked cease from troubling, and the Weary are at Rest:</HI> In a Word, Death is a secure Retreat from all the Calamities of Life, under the Pressure of which the whole Creation groans and travels, and is therefore on this Account as acceptable to many, as the Darkness of the Night to the wearied Hireling!</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009023_0007_103074A4064047E0"/>BUT this is not all, Death likewise puts a final Period to all our Opportunities of Service; we have now many Advantages to do Good, and must account for our Diligence and Fidelity in the Improvement of them; but these will soon be over. Death will, in a little Time, bring every one of us that awful Message, <HI>Give an Account of thy Stewardship, for thou mayest be no longer Steward.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I proceed to consider the Aspect that Death has upon a <HI>future Life.</HI></P>
<P>HERE observe, That by Death our Souls are brought to live in a State of Separation from our Bodies, tho' <HI>the Dust returns to</HI> its original <HI>Earth,</HI> yet our <HI>Spirits return to God who gave them.</HI> They become, by quitting these Mansions, unembodied Spirits, and enter upon a new Scene of Life, in which they have no Use for the Organs of Sense and Motion; Death liberates our Souls from the Incumbrance of elementary Bodies, and thereby awakes their noble Powers to greater Vigor and Sublimity in their Operations; it frees our Spirits from their Dependance on animal Bodies, and from the Impressions made on them by sensible Objects, so that the Pleasures thence issuing for ever terminate, and are now derived from Objects better suited to the immaterial Nature of the Soul. Further,</P>
<P>BY Death our Souls enter into an unseen World, and change their Place as well as their Mode of living, we pass by Death into the vast HADES, or invisible World; to us an undiscovered and untried Country, which neither our Senses can give us any Notice of, or our Reason comprehend; and in which we shall meet with new Society, and such a vast Variety of new Objects and Entertainments, either in themselves, or in Respect
<PB N="10" REF="009023_0008_103074AA7136F7F0"/>
of our <HI>Apprehension</HI> of them; (then immediate and perfect) as will furnish a sufficient Fund for everlasting Wonder, Love, and Praise! When our Spirits pass out of the narrow Current of Time, they leave this minute Point of Earth on which we tread, and take their Flight into those immense Territories, over which he presides who has the Keys of Hell and Death.</P>
<P>FURTHER, our Souls pass from a State of Tryal to a State of Rewards and Punishments, as incomprehensible as excellent, satisfactory, eternal; Rewards which the human Mind in its sublimest Flights cannot grasp, and which all Language and Images fail adequately to express.</P>
<P>THO' the general Judgment be deferred till the Resurrection, yet the Soul undergoes a particular Judgment, immediately after its Departure from the Body, or something analogous to it, which is previously necessary to its being fixed in a State of Bliss or Misery; and this the sacred Scriptures assure us is the Case of all that depart this Life, as appears by the Parable of <HI>Dives</HI> and <HI>Lazarus,</HI> the Promise of Christ to the Thief on the Cross, and the Desire of the Apostle to be dissolved, that he might be with Jesus.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Improvement</HI> of this Subject now calls for your Attention.</P>
<P>DOES DEATH bring such visible Ruin upon our Nature, and is it the penal Fruit of Sin? Then what Reason has any Man living to be proud, who constantly carries about with him such poignant Incentives to Humility, in the Mortality of his very Frame, which has in it the Seeds of innumerable Diseases, and of Death: Should he boast of his Descent who must <HI>say of Corruption thou art my Father, and to the Worm thou art my Mother and my Sister.</HI>—Shall we glory in our Strength
<PB N="11" REF="009023_0009_103074AC842C8310"/>
which is crushed before the Moth?—Or in our Beauty, whose Features shall put on a ghastly Pale, and be stained with Putrefaction?—Shall we be puffed up with Wealth and Honor who must so soon leave them, and sink in undistinguished Dust and deep Oblivion?—And seeing Sin has intailed this Curse of Mortality upon us, we may thence infer its great Malignity, and should be thereby enduced to behave towards it accordingly, as the most odious Deformity and fatal Source of all our Woes!</P>
<P>IS the Empire of Death absolute and universal? Then how little is Man to be trusted in, whose Breath is in his Nostrils, continually exposed to innumerable Accidents? <HI>Surely Men of low Condition are Vanity, and Men of high Degree a Lye:</HI> Who may by corrupt Biases, inconstant Resolutions, or by sudden Death, disappoint our Expectations from them; if any deserved our Confidence, it would be the great and powerful, but even those we are cautioned against a Dependance on: <HI>Trust not in Princes, nor in the Son of Man, in whom there is no Help, his Breath goeth out, he returns to his Earth; in that very Day his Thoughts perish.</HI></P>
<P>DOES Death put a Period to all our secular Affairs, then how moderate should we be in the Prosecution of them, inviolably observing the rational and excellent Medium between Extreams, prescribed by the Apostle, <HI>Sorrowing as tho' we sorrowed not, and rejoicing as tho' we rejoiced not, because the Fashion of this World passeth away.</HI> Death strips the World of its deceitful Charms, and represents it in its native Dress of Emptiness and Vanity; The Grave sets before our Eyes in a strong Point of Light, of how little Significancy human Greatness and Prosperity are, to those who must in a short Space leave them all behind, and go as naked out of the World
<PB N="12" REF="009023_0010_103074AE40755710"/>
as they came into it: Certainly covetous Persons that make a great Noise and Bustle about their Projects and Designs, <HI>Spend their Money for that which is not Bread, walk in a vain Shew, and vex themselves in vain.</HI></P>
<P>WILL Death put a final Period to all the Sufferings of this Life and that to come, with Respect to such as fear God and work Righteousness? Then let us endure them with Patience and Fortitude, for they are <HI>light, and but for a Moment, and therefore not worthy to be compared with the exceeding great and eternal Weight of Glory before us!</HI> Death will send our pained Bodies to the Dormitory of the Grave, and in Case we truely repent of Sin, and believe in Jesus, translate our afflicted Souls to the Rest of God, where all Tears shall be wiped away, and we shall enjoy a Felicity, large as our Desires, and lasting as our Souls.</P>
<P>AND seeing Death concludes our gracious Seasons, and Opportunities of Service, let us <HI>awake out of Sleep,</HI> and <HI>work while the Day lasts, for the Night cometh in which no Man can work.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I proceed to speak a little on the melancholy Occasion of this Discourse, <HI>viz.</HI> The <HI>Death</HI> of our late gracious <HI>Soverign, King GEORGE</HI> the <HI>Second,</HI> of happy Memory; a Prince who may be in Justice denominated, the <HI>Father</HI> of his People: A Prince who thro' the whole Course of his Reign aimed at no despotic tyrannical Sway, but on the Contrary expressed due Respect to the representative Body of the Nation, and made its Laws and Constitution the invariable Rule of his Conduct: As he wronged no Man of his private <HI>Property,</HI> so he granted to all that religious <HI>Liberty;</HI> which, as it is the Birth-right of all, so it is the greatest Support and Ornament
<PB N="13" REF="009023_0011_103074B014D69C28"/>
of real Christianity, which is a reasonable Service, founded on Argument, the Issue of impartial Enquiry and free Choice: But the Reverse hereof, is built on the Ruins of every Thing that is valuable in human Nature, and directly tends to destroy the Religion of Jesus entirely, by setting up other Kings in his spiritual Kingdom, and claiming Allegiance to them in Opposition to his Authority: In brief, it opposes Humanity and enslaves Mankind.</P>
<P>HERE give me Leave transiently to observe, That there was a memorable Resemblance or Analogy between the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Monarch <HI>David,</HI> and our deceased Sovereign, in Respect of his heroic military Character, as appears particularly from the intrepid Bravery of the latter at the famous Battle of DETTINGEN, the Issue of which reflected as great Glory on the Arms of <HI>Britain,</HI> as it did Scandal on those of <HI>France!</HI></P>
<P>AS the Prosperity of his People was the principal Object of his Attention, so he was anxious and unwearied in the Prosecution of it to the last Moments of his Life; and hence the Nation's Esteem and Love encreased with his growing Years, which is not only evident from their public Declarations, but likewise by their extraordinary <HI>Union</HI> among themselves; and, that even under the prodigious Load of an expensive War, the great Variety of their Denominations, religious Principles, and Party Views notwithstanding.</P>
<P>IN Consequence of the aforesaid <HI>Union,</HI> it pleased that divine Providence, by which Kings reign, and Princes decree Justice, to crown the latter Part of the Administration of our deceased Sovereign with such an astonishing Train of memorable Victories by Land and Sea, as will be the Wonder of Posterity,
<PB N="14" REF="009023_0012_103074B32144C8E0"/>
and brighten the <HI>British</HI> Annals in all future Time: As this illustrious Aera reflects great Honor on the King, his Councils, and Arms, so if rightly improved, it opens, under Providence, a Prospect of EMPIRE for the Nation, beyond what the most sanguine Hopes would have sometime since dared to dictate; an Empire that will give her vastly more Weight in the Scale of <HI>Europe,</HI> if not (in a Course of Time) constitute her the Arbitress of it.</P>
<P>BUT in the midst of this surprizing Series of the most important Events, in this critical Conjuncture of a War with numerous and potent Nations, combined in an unjust, extraordinary and formidable Confederacy, to ruin entirely a Protestant Prince, and one of the most renowned, intrepid, and invincible <HI>Heroes</HI> that the present or any past Age has produced; I mean his <HI>Prussian Majesty:</HI> In this Situation of Things our successful Monarch dies, dies suddenly, while beloved and revered, dies the Desire and Delight of his People; while <HI>France,</HI> our artful implacable Enemy, who has so long insulted the Honor, ensnared the Councils, and meditated the Ruin of our Nation: I say, while this arogant Rival-Power is exceedingly humbled, and almost brought to Reason, while <HI>France</HI> is stripped of many Fortresses and vast Domains in divers Parts of the World, especially in <HI>America</HI> and the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> her Fleet broken, and her Trade destroyed, our beloved Sovereign dies, and leaves his great and good Designs, in Respect of War and Peace, on which his Heart was so much set, unfinished: A melancholy Providence this! which should be laid to Heart, and rightly improved; let us there∣fore humble ourselves under the mighty Hand of God, that he may exalt us in due Time; let us implore Heaven that this Event may be over-ruled to the Good of our NATION in particular, and of ZION in general: Let us be hereby stirred
<PB N="15" REF="009023_0013_103074B713D1DE28"/>
up to prepare for our own Dissolution, which how near it is, and how sudden it may be, we know not; as <HI>Horace</HI> justly observes, Death makes no Distinction between the Cottages of Peasants and the Palaces of Princes:—And from hence let us likewise learn the extreme Vanity of all human Greatness and Dignity, which cannot screen their Possessors from the Stroke of a sudden Death.</P>
<P>IN the mean Time give me Leave to observe, that thro' divine Goodness, there are some Circumstances attending this <HI>Gloom</HI> of Providence, which may allay our Griefs and animate our Hopes, especially these following, <HI>viz.</HI> The MODE (or Circumstances) of our late Sovereign's Exit, the Qualifications of his MINISTRY, the promising Endowments of his SUCCESSOR, and the late famous VICTORY of the King of <HI>Prussia,</HI> over the <HI>Austrian</HI> Army.</P>
<P>THE Circumstances of our late Sovereign's Exit were respectable, similar to those of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Hero in our Text, particularly, he died in a good old Age, full of Days, being arrived to his Seventy-seventh Year, after a Reign of Thirty-three, very near the same Space that <HI>David</HI> reigned over <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> it is but a small Number of Mankind of any Order that live to such an Age, and very few Princes in any Part of the World reign so long a Space. Certainly, my Brethren, we have great Reason to adore the blessed God, with the most ardent Gratitude, that so mild and equitable an Administration was continued with us so long; which if compared with the arbitrary, popish, oppressive Reigns of the Male Line of the STEWART Family, may in Reason accent the Gratitude of all sincere Protestants, for so very valuable a Mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="009023_0014_103074BA63483A00"/>BUT to proceed, our late Sovereign likewise died full of Riches and Honor, the Legacies mentioned in his last Will prove the former, and the numerous Addresses of the Nation confirm the latter, and both of them are valuable Benefits, promised by the Almighty, to excite the Creatures Obedience.</P>
<P>IT is likewise an encouraging Circumstance, that our deceased Sovereign left so able, faithful, and resolute a <HI>Ministry</HI> at the Helm of the Nation; among which the truly Honorable Mr. PITT shines with distinguished Lustre, a PATRIOT of such surprizing Capacity, such extraordinary Disinterestedness, and unshaken Firmness, as no Artifice could elude, no Opposition intimidate, or Bribe seduce, from his inviolable Adherence to such Measures as were necessary to promote the Honor and Interest of the Nation; a Patriot this, who is, in very Deed, the Guardian, Joy, and Glory of his Country: It is he who has roused the sleeping Genius of the Nation from a State of inglorious Ease, sordid Pusillanimity, and sorry Congresses, to War and Arms, to assert its just Rights by numerous Acts of heroic Bravery, whereby the Honor of the <HI>British</HI> FLAG and Land Forces is retrieved, vindicated from Contempt, made respectable in the Esteem of all Nations, made the Joy of its Friends, and the Terror of its Enemies: These glorious Designs were so far from being compassed by the specious pacific Schemes and trifling Treaties, (with a Court inured to Artifice and Chicane) which were proposed and pursued by a former Ministry, that the Honor and Interest of the Nation were betrayed, its Possessions, Trade, and Influence, by Degrees so impaired, that it was brought to the very Brink of Ruin, a Plan to complete it was as artfully as confidently concerted, and almost fully prepared for the fatal Execution: O dreadful, deplorable Situation! <HI>(Quis talia fando, temperet a Lachrymis;)</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="009023_0015_103074BFF697B158"/>
But blessed be God, thro' the favorable Smiles of Providence upon the Conduct of a skilful, faithful PILOT, the <HI>British</HI> Vessel almost shipwrecked, now emerges above the threatning Waves, resumes its ancient Empire, and commands the Ocean.</P>
<P>'TIS He that has directed the Nation to its true and most important Interest, as well as to the most probable and least expensive Measures to obtain and preserve it, by annexing to the <HI>British</HI> Crown, thro' a proper Exertion of its chief natural Strength (its superior naval Force) this Western EMPIRE, of vast, yea, unknown Extent, and of immense Value.</P>
<P>AND it must needs give sensible Pleasure to every generous Mind, to see the extraordinary Merit of this Gentleman, so publicly, so justly, and generally acknowledged by the Nation, in Sentiments and Expressions of the most passionate and per∣manent Gratitude, hereby nobly laboring to make the Memory of his valuable Services as lasting as Time itself, as durable as they are diffusive and truly noble: A Reward, which tho' it be most reasonable and equitable, yet because of the prodigious Degeneracy of human Nature, is not always the Attendant of the most noble Actions, the most distinguished Merit, witness famous MARLBOROUGH, justly for some Time the Darling and Pride of the Nation, the Wonder of <HI>Eu∣rope,</HI> and the Scourge of <HI>France,</HI> yet afterwards, as unjustly as ungratefully, reproached, rejected, and contemned: O La∣mentable! may that unhappy Fate be graciously prevented in the present Case, by that Providence that presides over all!</P>
<P>BUT that which is still more animating in our present Situation, is the amiable <HI>Character</HI> we have received of his present Majesty, <HI>King</HI> GEORGE <HI>the Third,</HI> the Grandson of
<PB N="18" REF="009023_0016_103074C2CBCE1070"/>
our deceased Sovereign, <HI>who now reigns in his Stead,</HI> a <HI>Character</HI> which his early Instruction in the Principles of LIBERTY, enforced by the amiable Examples of his famous Predecessors and Relatives, since the ever memorable <HI>Revolution,</HI> under pious <HI>King William,</HI> of glorious Memory; King WILLIAM, who in the midst of much Labor, eminent Hazard, and great Discouragements, nobly laid, with a masterly Hand, the very Foundations of all that is dear to us, as Men, as Christians, and as Protestants; LAID the Basis of all our present inestimable Privileges of every Kind, Privileges that should form such indelible Impressions of Gratitude upon our Minds, as no artful Colorings of designing Men, or length of Time, should ever be able to extinguish.</P>
<P>BUT to return from this Digression, what has been said concerning the reigning Prince, considered in Connection with his religious and virtuous EDUCATION in Protestant Prin∣ciples, enforced by good Practice <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Precepta docent, Exempla cogunt.</NOTE> (under the Tuition of a Nobleman of distinguished Piety, a Preceptor of superior Ge∣nius) and recommended by the Influence of his religious and illustrious Parent, the PRINCESS DOWAGER of WALES, renders the aforesaid <HI>Character</HI> highly probable, and gives us Reason to hope, that his tender opening Mind has been early imbued with those noble and humane Sentiments, early impressed with those devout Affections, which when habitual and prevalent, are the true Genius and distinguishing Glory of vital Christi∣anity, as necessary, as ornamental, necessary both to private and public Life, for every Step of Elevation in the Scale of Offices, Dignity and Dominion, from the lowest to the highest of them (from the Nadir to the Zenith) to make them comfortable, honorable, and useful here, and to make us meet for a future glorious State!</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="009023_0017_103074C58F3599B8"/>I MAY add, that the preceeding CHARACTER of his present Majesty is confirmed by the Beginnings of his Administration, especially by the PROCLAMATION for the Encouragement of Virtue and Piety, and for preventing and punishing Vice, Prophaness and Immorality; a PROCLAMA∣TION worthy of the greatest and best of Princes; a PROCLA∣MATION as necessary in these Times of Degeneracy and Corruption, to promote the Safety and Weal of the Nation, as it is excellent in Respect of its Matter, and elegant in Regard of its Form; the strong Terms in which it is expressed, together with the Order to read it publicly in Courts and Churches several Times a Year, have an excellent Tendency, a pious and promising Aspect on the Church and Nation, and are an encouraging OMEN of Good to come.</P>
<P>HEAR with Attention, Veneration, and grateful Love, what his gracious Majesty, our young SOLOMON, our <HI>British</HI> JOSIAS, speaks from the THRONE!</P>

that we cannot expect the Blessing and Goodness of Almighty God (by whom Kings reign, and on which we entirely rely) to make our Reign happy and prosperous to ourself and our People, without a religious Observance of God's holy Laws: To the Intent therefore, that Religion, Piety, and good Manners may (according to our most hearty Desire) flourish and encrease under our Administration and Govern∣ment, we have thought fit, by the Advice of our Privy-Council, to issue this our Royal Proclamation, and do hereby declare our Royal Purpose and Resolution, to dis∣countenance and punish all Manner of Vice, Prophaness and Immorality, in all Persons, of whatsoever Degree or Quality, within this our Realm, and particularly, in such as are employed near our Royal Person; and that for the Encouragement of Religion and Morality, we will upon all Occasions distinguish Persons of Piety and Virtue, by Marks of our Royal Favor. And we do expect and require that all Persons of Honor, or in Place of Authority, will give good Example by their own Virtue and Piety, and to their utmost contribute to the discountenancing Persons of dissolute and debauched Lives: And we do hereby strictly enjoin and prohibit all our loving Subjects, of what Degree or Quality soever, from playing on the Lord's Day, at Dice, Cards, or any other Game whatsoever, either in public or private Houses, or other Place or Places whatsoever: And we do hereby require and command them, and every of them, decently and reverently, to attend the Worship of God on every Lord's Day, on Pain of our highest Displeasure, and of being proceeded against with the utmost Rigor that may be by Law.—Thus far the KING.</P>

<P>HOW vastly different is this Specimen from that execrable Order, to read a <HI>Book</HI> of <HI>Sports</HI> on the Lord's Day, which some
<PB N="21" REF="009023_0019_103074CB6631A620"/>
Time since came from the <HI>British</HI> THRONE; <HI>(O Tempora, O Mores!)</HI> I say the THRONE; but influenced by an infamous PRELATE, who was as great a Curse to the NATION, as he was a Reproach to those of his own Order, a popishly inclined CEREMONY-MONGER, who crammed down the Throat of the NATION by meer Force, not of Argument, but of civil Power, the pernicious Principles of ARMINIUS, before opposed by the Generality of the CLERGY, as well as openly and expresly dis∣claimed and detested by the PARLIAMENT, its representative Body, as the direct Road to POPERY; but have ever since be∣come prevalent in it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I mean by the Word IT, the Nation.</NOTE> among Persons of every Order: When I consider the persecuting Conduct of this Man in general, and in particular the BOOK of SPORTS procured by him, to be read by all the Ministers of the Churches on the Lord's Day, pub∣licly, on Pain of Exclusion from their Office and Support, I cannot help thinking on that horrid Purpose of the PAGAN, which I tremble to relate. <HI>(Horresco referens.)</HI>
<Q>Flectere si nequeo Superos, Acheronta movebo.</Q>
<HI>i. e.</HI> If I cannot incline the Diety to favor my Designs, I will try what Assistance I can get from the Devil.—I will not presume to say that his GRACE had any Thoughts of Satan, or knowingly harboured any bad Intentions in his severe and prophane Management; no Doubt he imagined that he did God Service by it, which doubtless lessened the Degree of its Malignity in Respect of himself, but in the Mean Time, his Practice was certainly worthy of the worst of Sentiments and Designs; and in Regard of Matter, Tendency, and Issue (as to others) the same as if his had been such.</P>
<P>IT is therefore unaccountable that any who wear a human Form, should pretend to vindicate such horrid Iniquity in open
<PB N="22" REF="009023_0020_103074CE25F95810"/>
Day, but these <HI>Men,</HI> if we may venture to call them such, who scarce retain any Thing human but the Shape, glory in their Shame, and while they profess themselves wise become Fools; as they bewray awful Enmity against all Religion and Virtue, and hereby commence Enemies to Mankind, and public Pests to civil Society; so they, with equal Wisdom and Modesty, set themselves in Opposition against, and bid open Defiance to, the plainest Dictates of Reason and common Sense: Tell it not in <HI>Gath,</HI> and publish it not in the Streets of <HI>Askelon,</HI> that any Protestant has done this, least the Uncircum∣cised triumph; be astonished, O ye Heavens, at this crimson Impiety, and be horribly afraid!</P>
<P>BUT, blessed be JEHOVAH, we live in better Times, having the unspeakably precious and important Privilege of a truly PIOUS PRINCE on the THRONE, who may, with Justice and Propriety, be compared to King SOLOMON, in Respect of Wisdom and Prudence as to the Affairs of Government and State, and to King JOSIAS in Regard of Humility, Modesty, early and noble Zeal for Religion and Virtue, so far as he has yet proceeded in his ADMINISTRATION, in which these excellent Virtues and princely Endowments shine with such rival Lustre, that its hard to say which has the Preheminence: This real and reviving Verity appears with a strong Glare of Light, from all the Transactions of his infant Reign, whether consi∣dered singly, or in a complex View, and especially from the PROCLAMATION (before mentioned) and his SPEECH to both Houses of <HI>Parliament,</HI> which easily and evidently appear to every unprejudiced Mind, to be no Matter of Form, Custom, or Compliment, but a candid, cordial Declaration, a deter∣mined Resolution, and serious Endeavour to promote the Honor of God and the Good of the Nation, by the Use of those Means which Revelation prescribes, and Reason itself
<PB N="23" REF="009023_0021_103074D22188BB68"/>
confirms; Means that only can, under Providence, secure and perpetuate the Prosperity of any Nation, witness the four famous Monarchies, and the <HI>Jewish</HI> Kingdom, who for the Neglect of them were brought to extreme Distress and deplorable Ruin! These Specimens appear to proceed from a rational consistent View of Things, and from a Heart tenderly touched, and intensely engaged.</P>
<P>AS the Royal Writings (before mentioned) in Favor of Religion and Liberty, are at least equal to any that ever came from the <HI>British</HI> Throne in any preceeding Period, in Respect of their important Matter, nervous Force of Argument, and inimitable Beauty of Diction, as well as on Account of the superior Acumen, distinguished Candor, Modesty and Affection with which they are formed; so it is hoped they cannot fail of giving the highest Satisfaction to every Man, that fears God and loves his Country, in every Part of the <HI>British</HI> EMPIRE, and of exciting their Affection to their Sovereign, as well as their Gratitude to GOD, on Account of this animating Prospect of national Weal, Prosperity and Glory, in all valuable Respects, as well as the best Interest of Individuals, which thro' the gracious Agency of his all-ruling Providence, now opens before us!</P>
<P>BUT to give Light and Force to this Argument, I must beg Leave, with all the Veneration and Respect due from a Subject to his Sovereign, to borrow a few Hints from the aforesaid <HI>Speech</HI> of his SACRED MAJESTY, to both Houses of PARLIAMENT, which are as follows:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I need not tell you the Addition of Weight which im∣mediately falls upon me, in being called to the Government
<PB N="24" REF="009023_0022_103074D5B74619C8"/>
of this free and powerful Country at such a Time, and under such Circumstances. My Consolation is the Upright∣ness of my own Intentions, your faithful and united Assistance, and the Blessing of Heaven upon our joint En∣deavours, which I devoutly implore.</P>
<P>BORN and educated in this Country, I glory in the Name of <HI>Briton;</HI> and the peculiar Happiness of my Life will ever consist in promoting the Welfare of a People whose Loyalty and warm Affection to me, I consider as the greatest and most permanent Security of my Throne: And I doubt not but their Steadiness in those Principles, will equal the Firmness of my invariable Resolution to adhere to, and strengthen this excellent Constitution in Church and State, and to maintain the Toleration inviolable. The civil and religious Rights of my loving Subjects are equally dear to me, with the most valuable Prerogatives of my Crown; and as the surest Foundation of the whole, and the best Means to draw down the divine Favor on my Reign, it is my fixed Purpose to countenance and encourage the Practice of true Religion and <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My Lords and Gentlemen,</HI></P>
<P>THE Eyes of all <HI>Europe</HI> are upon you, from your Reso∣lutions, the Protestant Interest hopes for Protection.—</P>
</LETTER>
<P>AS this and the other Performance (before mentioned) of our PIOUS Sovereign, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As I Trust.</NOTE> need no Commendation from any, so I freely acknowledge they are vastly above mine, yet I hope I may be indulged the Pleasure of expressing the genuine Sen∣timents of my Heart on so agreeable, yea glorious an Occasion,
<PB N="25" REF="009023_0023_103074DB0B141710"/>
which promises so great Good to the Church and State: O may the gracious God make us deeply sensible of the un∣speakable Moment of our present Advantages, both religious and civil, and enable us to testify our Gratitude to God and Man for them, by a conscientious Improvement; <HI>giving to Caesar the Things that are Caesar's, and to God the Things that are God's;</HI> and may our gracious Sovereign, who begins his Reign with such amiable Auspices of MODESTY, PRUDENCE, and PIETY, live long a Comfort to himself, a Blessing to the Kingdoms, over which he governs in particular, and to the Protestant Church in general; may he be in Fact, what by his Royal Dignity he is in Title, <HI>a Defender of the Faith,</HI> and this I verily hope will be the honorable and happy Attendant of his Reign; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>THE great Influence of <HI>Authority</HI> properly exerted, and enforced by good <HI>Example</HI> from the THRONE, to promote national REFORMATION, and the Power of the Contrary to corrupt and deprave Communities, appear in Contrast with sufficient Light and Evidence from the Narrative given in the sacred Pages respecting the KINGS of JUDAH and ISRAEL.</P>
<P>AND the Necessity of a national REFORMATION to secure and perpetuate national Prosperity and Glory, appears not only from express and repeated <HI>Promises</HI> thereof in this Situation of Things, and as explicite <HI>Threatnings</HI> of the Contrary in Case of a general Corruption of Manners; (<HI>See Jer.</HI> xviii. 7—11—) but also from the Series of God's dealings with the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> and other Nations in Conformity thereto.—This divine Conduct Reason itself approves, for seeing it is but right, just, and condecent, suitable to the divine Character, suitable to the very Nature of Things, and necessary to answer the Ends of Government; that the moral Governor of the World should discountenance Vice, and encourage Virtue, by proper Punishments and Rewards: And seeing Communities, as such, terminate with the present Life, of Consequence the Members that compose them can only be treated as Individuals in a future State, it is therefore necessary that BODIES POLITIC, he rewarded or punished here according to their public MORAL CHARACTER.— Some Peculiarities of the <HI>Jewish</HI> State (under a Theocracy) in juridicial Matters, adapted to their singular Circumstances, do not in any Measure militate against, or enervate Arguments deduced from Reason and Equity, which equally affect all Nations in all Cases that are similar and parallel; and hence the absolute Necessity of a general REFORMATION of Manners, to promote national Weal and Prospe∣rity, and prevent Desolation and Ruin, is conspicuous and apparent: Without this, no political PENETRATION, no martial FORTITUDE, however necessary and amiable, no SUCCESSES, tho' numerous and glorious, no NAVAL ARMAMENTS and <HI>Land Forces,</HI> however grand and formidable, no OPPULENCE, however immense, can secure guilty Nations from Misery and Ruin, denounced by incensed Omnipotence, any more than dry Stubble can defend itself in Contest with devour∣ing Flames!</P></NOTE> But to sum up the Desire of my Heart in
<PB N="26" REF="009023_0024_103074DF453DA4F0"/>
one Word, give me Leave to say, <HI>God Save the King;</HI> or, which is the same in other Words, in a different Language, a little paraphrased:
<Q><L>"Unum opto id, Princeps sit tibi certa Salus:</L>
<L>"Hoc satis unum: quoniam te Sospite nobis,</L>
<L>"Succedent Regno prospera cuneta tuo.</L>
<L>"Caltha suos nusquam Vultus a Sole reflectit,</L>
<L>"Illo oriente patens, illo abeunte latens,</L>
<L>"Nos quoque pendemus de te Sal noster, ad omnes</L>
<L>"Expositi rerum te subeunte vices.</L></Q></P>
<P>IN fine, when the State of the War in <HI>Germany</HI> very lately took an unpromising Turn, by the <HI>Russian</HI> and <HI>Austrian</HI> Armies taking the <HI>Capital</HI> of <HI>Prussia,</HI> and by the Defeat of the He∣reditary <HI>Prince</HI> of <HI>Brunswick</HI> by the <HI>French,</HI> and every Thing looked dark and distressing; then did divine Providence, when all was put to the Risque, seasonably and graciously interpose in our Favor, by giving a complete and decisive Victory over the Grand <HI>Austrian</HI> Army, under the Direction of Marshal DAUN, to the brave, but oppressed and invironed KING of PRUSSIA.</P>
<P>THIS Victory appears the more marvellous, affecting, and important, when we consider the Superiority of the <HI>Austrian</HI> Army, in Respect of their Numbers, the Freshness of their Troops, their Advantage in Respect of Situation, and the great Experience, Skill, and Caution of their General, another
<PB N="27" REF="009023_0025_103074E1323BB5F0"/>
FABIUS MAXIMUS, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Roman</HI> General who conquered HANNIBAL, the <HI>Carthaginian,</HI> by Delays.</NOTE> who having great Resources, has long sought by Delays to ruin his <HI>Prussian</HI> Majesty, and had got consi∣derable Advantage against him in two preceeding Battles, some Time ago, which must give fresh Spirit to his Forces; and on the other Hand, when we at the same Time view our brave Allie under very discouraging Circumstances, his Troops fatigued, deprived of many of his experienced gallant Generals, and faith∣ful Veteran Soldiers, in former bloody Battles, who in Firmness equaled the <HI>Macedonian</HI> PHALANX, himself oppressed with the Weight of an unequal War, at a Loss which Way to bend his Course, or which of his numerous and potent Enemies to fight first; add to this that the End of the Campaign was near, and that he had no Resource (no sufficient one) in Case of a total Defeat, from hence I presume it appears, that his Fate and ours turned in some Measure on the Issue of this BATTLE; there was a Danger either of his losing his Crown, or our loosing our late Acquisitions to preserve it: How great then is the Goodness of God in crowning the Scene thus far by this surprizing Success, when there was a Necessity of putting all to the Fortune of War upon such unequal Terms, to prevent a sure but lingring Death: Surely this gives Encou∣ragement to expect the Continuance of the divine Favors, in Case we faithfully improve, by Repentance and Reformation, the Mercies we have already received, and resolutely prosecute the same political and martial Measures (to which many sincere Friends of the Nation, heartily wish the Addition of another Allie at least, to assist in the Land War, in Case the Peace is not concluded this Winter) which have been hitherto favored by Providence, which may the good God grant for Jesus Christ his Sake. <HI>Amen, Amen.</HI></P>
