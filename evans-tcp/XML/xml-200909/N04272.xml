</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">D</SEG>EATH is elegantly described in Scripture, as <HI>the King of terrors:</HI> And to an eye of sense is a most formidable evil. It tears down these tabernacles of clay, which are the habitations of our immortal spirits: It turns these beautiful and active bodies, into heaps of deformity and corruption: It separates us from this world and its agreable enjoyments, and fixes the soul in an <HI>unalterable</HI> state of happiness or misery.</P>
<P>SO great is the fondness of mankind for this present life; — so strong their aversion to a dissolution; that we need the highest cordials to support us against the approaches of Death, and to enable us with a becoming fortitude to en∣counter this grand enemy of human nature.</P>
<P>AND, Blessed be God, the Gospel has laid a sufficient foundation for our support and comfort in this melancholly hour. — Our great
<PB N="4" REF="005268_0004_1016F2C638A4EA60"/>
REDEEMER hath scattered the darkness of the grave, <HI>and brought life and immortality to light. Thro'</HI> the vertue of his own meritorious <HI>death; he hath destroyed him that had the power of death, that is the devil, and delivered them who thro' fear of death, were all their life time subject to bondage.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> II. 14, 15.</NOTE> In his name, and by the victorious power of his grace, every true believer may meet this universal terror of mankind with an holy triumph, and lay down his head in the dust with serenity and joy.</P>
<P>THE Gospel represents death to the true Christian, not as an enemy but as a friend: Not as the object of their terror and aversion, but rather of their complacency and desire. It de∣scribes our departure out of this world, as a deliverance from this vale of tears, and an intro∣duction to a state of consummate blessedness: A translation from the fading enjoyments of time, to all the ineffable glories of eternity.</P>
<P>UPON these principles many of the Disciples of JESUS have welcom'd the approach of death as the messenger of their heavenly Father, and breath'd out their souls into the hands of God with extacy and triumph. A prospect of obtaining complete deliverance from sin their greatest burden, and dwelling with Christ their supreme delight, has wonderfully reconciled their tho'ts
<PB N="5" REF="005268_0005_1016F2C7C2C76148"/>
to a dying hour, and changed the dark valley of the shadow of death, into a scene of light and glory.</P>
<P>THUS the Apostle in my text, with an holy impatience, looks forward to the time of his dis∣solution, and waits for the happy period, as the weary traveller for the grateful shades of the evening.</P>
<Q><HI>Having a desire to depart,</HI> AND TO BE WITH CHRIST, WHICH IS FAR BETTER.</Q>
<P>In speaking to which words I shall (by divine assistance) proceed in the following method:</P>
<P>First, I shall shew that every true believer, when he departs out of this world goes to Christ.</P>
<P>Secondly, THIS is infinitely better than to abide in the flesh.</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>FIRST PART.</HEAD>
<P>EVERY true believer, when he departs out of this world, goes to Christ.</P>
<P>THIS was not peculiar to this favourite Apostle, but is the common privilege of every true Christian: When we <HI>are absent from the body, then we are present with the Lord.</HI> The Doctrine of Purgatory is an idle fiction of the Priests of mammon, contrived and propagated to establish
<PB N="6" REF="005268_0006_1016F2C94B29ECE8"/>
the tyranny of the BISHOP OF <HI>ROME,</HI> and support the grandeur of the PAPAL EMPIRE. The Opinion of the Sleep of the Soul, till the morning of the general resurrection, is a senseless dream, destructive of the very nature and essence of an immaterial spirit, and contrary to many plain and express passages in the inspired Scrip∣tures. — Why should the Apostle expect with pleasure the time of his separation from the body, if death were to cast him into an insensible slumber, and deprive him of all those blessed commmunications of divine LIFE and LOVE which he enjoy'd upon earth? — Why should he desire to be dissolv'd and be with Christ, if all his perceptive powers were to be chain'd up in a profound sleep, and he was to remain for so long a season without any delightful views of the divine glory, or any participation of the joys of his immediate presence? — Upon this suppo∣sition, it would be evidently more eligible to abide in the flesh, amidst the labours and enjoy∣ments of this life, than to sink into an insensible state, and spend so many years in darkness and oblivion. But not to enlarge, —</P>
<P>NOTHING is more plain than that the scripture gives no countenance to this absurd and unreasonable imagination: But on the contrary assures us, that <HI>when this earthly house of our
<PB N="7" REF="005268_0007_1016F2CB0C2A1ED8"/>
tabernacle is dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> V. 1.</NOTE> Hence our Lord declares unto the penitent thief, when in the agonies of death, <HI>THIS DAY shalt thou be with me in Paradise.</HI></P>
<P>NOW to be with Christ, implies that the believer upon his departure out of this world, shall be immediately introduced into his divine presence, and be favoured with an intuitive vision of his glory. No sooner are they delivered from the burden of the flesh, but immediately they mount up upon the wings of love, and are con∣vey'd by a bright guard of ministring spirits into the imperial palace of heaven, — the presence chamber of their exalted Redeemer; where they see him, not in the humble form of a servant, but in the majestic state of an incarnate GOD: — Not in the inferior circumstances of poverty and disgrace, but incircled with all the dazzling splendors of heaven: — Not crown'd with thorns, but diadems of celestial glory: — Not hanging upon an infamous cross, but seated on the right-hand of the Majesty on high: — Not surrounded with insulting crouds of insolent sinners, but in∣compass'd with myriads of spotless saints.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="005268_0008_1016F2CF19EF6B68"/>THIS must needs be to every true believer a scene of the purest joy, the sublimest pleasure. — If St. <HI>Peter</HI> was so transported with a transient glimpse of his glory, when transfigured on the mount, that he forgot this lower world, and cried out, <HI>Lord it is good to be here;</HI> how will the saints exult and triumph when they have not only a vanishing glance, but a full view of his beautiful countenance: Not on Mount <HI>Tabor,</HI> in company with <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> but standing upon the Holy Hill of <HI>Zion,</HI> attended by the whole hierarchy of heaven. — If the Disciples were glad, when they saw their Lord break asunder the bars of the grave, and rise from the dead; how great will be their joy, when they see him seated upon a radiant throne, and swaying the sceptre of the invisible world.</P>
<P>WHAT can be more delightful to these holy souls, than to enjoy the blessed society of their dearest friend, and most generous benefactor; — to dwell continually with him, on whose name they have believed, in whose merits they have confided, and from whose hands they have re∣ceived a crown of eternal Life? How will it revive and rejoice their hearts, to behold him who was so unrighteously despised, so inhumanly tortured, so ignominiously crucified for their sakes; advanced to the highest pitch of splendor and
<PB N="9" REF="005268_0009_1016F2D306515EE0"/>
dignity, honoured and adored by all the happy inhabitants above; who with one consent cast their crowns at his feet, and celebrate the praises of his redeeming grace? With what rapturous pleasure shall they hear from his own blessed lips, the amazing history of his Love, the mighty triumphs of his Grace, and the distressing sorrows he past thro' for the redemption of an apostate world.</P>
<P>ESPECIALLY, Since they not only behold his glory, but dwell under the perpetual effusions of his love: They not only see his face, but partake of his goodness; they not only view the amiable excellencies of his nature, but find by happy experience all those divine attributes en∣gaged to promote their perfection and happiness. In the present state he advances them to the dignity of his children, adorns them with the graces of his spirit, and affords them the reviving foretastes of his love; but in heaven he unfolds all the treasures of his goodness, and showers down the boundless riches of his glory, into their purified and enlarged bosoms. The Blessed Redeemer looks down upon them with infinite pleasure, as the sacred purchase of his blood, and the conquests of his almighty grace; and is highly delighted with the reflection of his own
<PB N="10" REF="005268_0010_1016F2D4C77AC3B0"/>
image shining in them; <HI>as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so God rejoices over them.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isai.</HI> LXV. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND now, what higher conception of hap∣piness can we frame, than to dwell for ever with the best and most amiable of BEINGS; to love him with the most ardent affection; to receive the continual visits of <HI>his favour, which is life, and his loving kindness which is better than life itself.</HI> HAPPY SOULS! who are incircled in the arms of everlasting mercy, and lie imparadised in the bosom of GOD. They now, more than ever, rejoice in God their Saviour, and perpe∣tually triumph in their union to and communion with him: They break forth in the language of the spouse. — <HI>As the apple-tree among the trees of the wood, so is my beloved among the sons: I sit under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit is pleasant unto my taste: he has brought me into his banquetting-house, and spread his banner of love over me.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cant.</HI> II. 3-5.</NOTE> — This it is to be with Christ. — But how broken and imperfect an account are we able to give of those joys, <HI>which eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> II. 9.</NOTE> their excellency and glory. This is a theme fitter for the eloquence of an Angel, than the description of a feeble mortal,
<PB N="11" REF="005268_0011_1016F2D78BF975D0"/>
defiled with sin, and encompass'd with darkness. The glory of the saints is at present unseen; and we can form no adequate conceptions of it, till the vail of mortality is drawn aside, and we admitted into the sanctuary above: But so much is discovered as fully justifies my text, and shows that to be with Christ, is infinitely better than to abide in the flesh. And this I proposed for the SECOND GENERAL HEAD of my discourse.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>SECOND PART.</HEAD>
<P>LET us then proceed to consider in what respects <HI>to be with Christ is far better.</HI></P>
<P>THE body indeed is subject to a melancholly change; — those <HI>eyes</HI> are closed in darkness, that once beheld the light of the sun, and the beauties of this lower creation; — those <HI>hands</HI> are rendered useless, that were active instruments in the various offices of life; — those <HI>feet</HI> are fettered with the bands of death, that went about doing good: — our <HI>visible frame</HI> is utterly de∣molished, and blended with its original dust; but the Soul is delivered from the prison in which it was long confined, and in all respects makes a blessed exchange: — For,</P>
<P N="1">I. THEY change a state of toil and labour, for that of ease and refreshment: While upon
<PB N="12" REF="005268_0012_1016F2DA46AA5838"/>
earth, the servants of God are necessarily engaged in the business of the world, and are often called to a great deal of trouble and fatigue. While encumbered with these tabernacles of clay, and surrounded with an ensnaring world, they are obliged to be upon their perpetual guard, to <HI>watch and pray, lest they enter into temptation.</HI> But the saints above are delivered from all these toilsome labours: — <HI>Blessed are the dead, who die in the Lord; for they rest from their labours, and their works follow them.</HI> <NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> XIV. 13.</NOTE> <HI>They have fought the good fight, they have finished their course, henceforth there is laid up for them a crown of righteousness.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Tim.</HI> IV. 7, 8.</NOTE> They are no longer condemn'd to earn their bread with the sweat of their brows, but are fed with the heavenly <HI>Manna,</HI> the <HI>food of Angels!</HI> They no more spend their wearisome days in the pursuit of their general or particular callings; but receive the approbation of their Lord, and the reward of faithful servants. It is now no small part of a Christian's exercise, to bear up with a becoming fortitude and courage against the darkness, and difficulties, the temptations, and sufferings of this present life; but when their spirit's are lodged in <HI>Abraham</HI>'s bosom, they have no more sufferings to go through, no more lusts to mortify, no more enemies to conquer: <HI>Patience
<PB N="13" REF="005268_0013_1016F2DBCBF57278"/>
has had its perfect work;</HI> their day of battle is over, and their warfare is finally accomplish'd.</P>
<P>NOT that the righteous will lead an idle and unactive life: This would be contrary to the oeconomy of heaven, and an abatement of their particular happiness. — In what employments they will be engaged, we know not; — upon this head the scripture is silent; and it becomes us not to be wise above what is written. But this we know, — that they are perpetually engaged in the service of God; stand before him in the character of ministring spirits, inviolably keep∣ing the charge of his commandments: They join the blissful choir above in the joyful celebration of the divine praises, and rest not day and night, saying, — <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy, LORD GOD ALMIGHTY!</HI> And doubtless they look back with a grateful mixture of pleasure and surprize, upon the various scenes of providence toward them, while they dwelt upon earth; and adore the stupendous methods of divine grace, by which they were kept in the midst of number∣less dangers, and safely guided and preserved in the ways of salvation. Doubtless with the highest affection and gratitude, they raise fre∣quent and delightful songs to the honour of the beloved JESUS; who saved them from the ignominious bondage of sin, by his almighty
<PB N="14" REF="005268_0014_1016F2DFCE50FA60"/>
power; who justified them by his perfect righ∣teousness, and has finally made them the ever∣lasting monuments of his sovereign mercy.</P>
<P N="2">II. THEY pass out of a valley of tears, into a world of light and joy. The evils that attend human life, are as numerous, and often as violent as the tempestuous waves of the sea. Various and successive afflictions, like <HI>Job</HI>'s messengers, tread close upon the heels of each other. — Our Bodies are the seat of innumerable diseases; they frequently totter and shake, and are swiftly tending to the grave, <HI>the house appointed for the living.</HI> — Our Characters are exposed to the malignant breath of envy and malice. — Our Estates to rapine and violence. — And our dearest Friends are oftentimes snatched from our affectionate embraces. Upon these accounts, it is justly said, that <HI>men is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.</HI> But all these evils are confined to this transitory scene. The saints at death are translated to a world of perfect light, and un∣mingled joy: They are admitted to that place which infinite wisdom has contrived, almighty power hath framed, and everlasting love hath appointed for the reception of his chosen friends, his distinguished favourites. — <HI>There</HI> he sheds abroad his brightest glory, and showers down his abundant grace, to the unutterable transport of its happy inhabitants. — <HI>There</HI> shines a bright
<PB N="15" REF="005268_0015_1016F2E2A2011400"/>
and eternal day, without any intervening clouds or darkness. — <HI>There</HI> all is calm and serene, without confusion or disorder; <HI>all tears are wiped from their eyes;</HI> all sorrow banished from their breasts. — <HI>There</HI> is no more pain, no more death, <HI>for the former Things are passed away:</HI> In these peaceful regions, <HI>the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest:</HI> Their joys are without mixture or alloy; their pleasures divine and perpetual; and the remembrance of their past afflictions, serves only to encrease their present satisfaction, and inflame their gratitude to their almighty Deliverer.</P>
<P N="3">III. THEY are translated from a world of sin and temptation, to a state of purity and perfection. The true Christian, even in this imperfect state, is absolved from the guilt of sin, the curse of the fiery law, and the condemning sentence of divine justice. He is also saved from the tyrannical reign of lust, and no longer lives in a voluntary subjection to its unreasonable demands. The dominion of sin was destroyed in the day of his first conversion; and its interests are gradually decaying thro' the successive periods of the christian life.</P>
<P>BUT our universal nature is so deeply infected with this spreading <HI>leprosy,</HI> that it will never be perfectly purged out, while the earthly house of
<PB N="16" REF="005268_0016_1016F2E555892B18"/>
this tabernacle remains undissolved. Our most exact obedience to the divine law, is attended with innumerable defects, and our highest acts of faith weakened with the remains of unbelief. Our purest gold has an alloy of dross, and our best duties are polluted with sinful mixtures.</P>
<P>THIS is the constant burthen of the saints upon earth; and above all things embitters the present life, with its enjoyments. The relicks of indwelling corruption, cast a gloom upon their brightest days, and often obliges them to breathe out that melancholly complaint, in the passionate language of the Apostle, — <HI>O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death!</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> VII. 24.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT no sooner is the vital tie dissolved between the soul and body, but they are entirely purified from all remains of sin, and made perfect in holiness forever. Every corrupt affection and inclination is buried in the dust of death; and their sanctified spirits stand before the throne of GOD, without spot or blemish, without deformity or disorder. — O happy DAY! O joyful DELIVERANCE! when the servants of Christ shall no longer complain of any sinful darkness in their understanding, any remaining rebellion in their wills, or any defiling disorder in their
<PB N="17" REF="005268_0017_1016B924B3594380"/>
affections. — O thrice HAPPY SOULS! who are not only delivered from sin, but from all temp∣tation to it; — who have no more difficulties to conquer; — no more dangers to encounter; — no more spiritual enemies to vanquish; but have overcome <HI>thro' the blood of the Lamb,</HI> and are entered into a state of perfect victory and eternal triumph.</P>
<P>SURELY, to be with Christ is best of all! for such are ascended above the territories of the prince of darkness, and are out of the reach of all his fiery assaults: They dwell where there is no <HI>roaring lion</HI> to devour; no <HI>subtle serpent</HI> to allure; no malignant influences to destroy their purity, or disturb their happiness. That promise is completely fulfilled, — <HI>To him that overcometh, will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rev.</HI> III. 21.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">IV. THEY change the company of imperfect saints and ungodly sinners, for the society of spotless angels and <HI>the spirits of just men made perfect.</HI> In this world, saints and sinners dwell together in the same habitations: The sons of GOD converse with the children of <HI>Satan;</HI> and how often are the righteous vexed with the <HI>filthy
<PB N="18" REF="005268_0018_1016F2EBE44B59F0"/>
conversation</HI> of the wicked, and forced to com∣plain in the bitterness of their souls, — <HI>O that I had the wings of a dove, that I might flee away, and be at rest.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psalm</HI> LV. 6.</NOTE> Yea, the conversation of the godly, is too often interrupted by the remains of sin, and sadly embittered by difference of opinion and practice. They that are children of the same heavenly FATHER; united under the banners of the same COMMON LORD, and travel∣ling to the same <HI>undefiled inheritance;</HI> oftentimes unhappily fall out by the way; treat each other with a rigid and uncharitable distance, if not with unchristian and censorious language:</P>
<P>BUT death puts a final period to all these afflicting trials. In the <HI>new Jerusalem</HI> there is <HI>nothing that defileth.</HI> The blessed inhabitants above no more complain that they <HI>sojourn in Mesheck, and dwell in the tents of Kedar.</HI> They leave the society of imperfect saints upon earth, to join with <HI>the general assembly of the church of the first-born,</HI> — where perfect friendship, peace and amity reign forever, — where all the children of GOD, that were scattered abroad in this divided world, are gathered together in one vast and universal convention, — are perfectly united in judgment, affection, and practice, — with one heart, and one voice, join in singing the song of MOSES
<PB N="19" REF="005268_0019_1016F2EF045665B8"/>
and the LAMB. O BLESSED CHANGE! to pass from a peevish, ill-natur'd, and contentious world, to those calm and peaceable mansions of light and love.</P>
<P N="5">V. THEY are removed from this mutable scene, to a place of unchangeable felicity. How valuable forever the enjoyments of the world may be in the eyes of men▪ yet this exceedingly depreciates their worth, that they are of short and uncertain continuance. — The riches of the earth <HI>take to themselves wings, and flee away as an eagle towards heaven:</HI> — The pleasures of sense, are as the <HI>crackling of thorns under a pot;</HI> a sudden blaze that soon expires: — The applause of the world, depends upon the breath of the giddy multitude; and is therefore inconstant as the wind: — This earthly theatre, which is the seat of these inferior joys, is a vanishing scene; the stage itself will shortly be taken down, and all its actors retire into silence and oblivion. We plainly see that nothing here is substantial and durable; but <HI>blessed are the dead that die in the Lord:</HI> — They are heirs of a <HI>kingdom that cannot be shaken, a city that has foundations, whose builder and maker is GOD.</HI> When the sun itself shall fade, and all the lamps of heaven shall be extinguished, the righteous shall shine as <HI>the brightness of the firmament, and as the stars for ever
<PB N="20" REF="005268_0020_1016F2F08C079700"/>
and ever.</HI> When the elements shall melt with fervent heat, and the pillars of heaven tremble; they shall stand secure amidst the ruins of dissol∣ving nature, and spend eternal ages in undimi∣nished and unfading pleasures. And now who among us is not ready to say, Happy, O Lord, are these thy servants that stand in thy presence, <HI>behold thy face, and are satisfied with thy likeness!</HI> Must we not all join in the sentiments of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and say, <HI>to be with Christ is far better?</HI> — better than to live in this sinful and polluted world, — this vale of affliction and tears</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="improvement">
<HEAD>The IMPROVEMENT of my discourse remains.</HEAD>
<P N="1">I. IF this is the happiness of the servants of Christ; this the blessed exchange they make at death; how great is the madness of those who continue in the disgraceful service of sin and <HI>satan!</HI> GOD, in infinite compassion to apostate men, hath sent his SON, to call them off from the inferior enjoyments of time and sense, to the nobler entertainments of the heavenly world. By the gospel he invites them to accept the offers of his grace, and part with every thing that stands in competition with their eternal interest. But, alas! how careless are the greatest part of man∣kind in this important affair! how careful of the concerns of a dying body! how negligent of their immortal souls! — They prefer temporal to
<PB N="21" REF="005268_0021_1016F2F338047FF8"/>
eternal blessings; the fading satisfactions of sense, to those ineffable <HI>pleasures that flow at the right hand of God forever.</HI> What madness is in the hearts of men, thus greedily to pursue empty trifles, — deceitful vanities; — and sordidly neglect <HI>the one thing needful.</HI></P>
<P>MAKE a pause, my Brethren, and consider, — Are you not formed of the same brittle clay with the rest of your fellow-creatures? — Are you not every moment liable to the stroke of death? — Can you expect to be numbered with the children of the MOST HIGH, who now live in rebellion against his authority, in open defiance of his laws? — How can you hope to be with CHRIST in a future state; whose grace you resist, whose invaluable merits you trample under feet, and whose gracious yoke you obstinately and impe∣nitently refuse? Deceive not your selves with <HI>vain words;</HI> if ever you desire to see the face of God in peace, and dwell with Christ in glory; you must now be united to him, by a true and living faith; you must be justified by his grace; sanctified by his spirit, and be made conformable to his precepts and example. Would you <HI>die the death of the righteous;</HI> and do you wish your <HI>latter end may be like his?</HI> — Let it then be your first care to accept of Christ as your SAVIOUR; and in the exercise of an humble faith, to commit your souls into his almighty and compassionate
<PB N="22" REF="005268_0022_1016F2F4C3AF2938"/>
hands. — With incessant importunity, seek after the regenerating influences of his spirit, that that life may be begun in you, which abideth forever. <HI>Blessed and holy is he that hath part in THIS first RESURRECTION; over such the second death hath no power.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THIS affords abundant ground of comfort, when the servants of Christ are taken from us by death. Their piety gives no exemption from the common accidents of life: They fall by the same diseases with the rest of mankind; and their bodies are buried in the common dust. — In this respect, there is <HI>one event to the righteous, and the wicked;</HI> — the servants of God and the subjects of Satan. But at the moment of their dissolution, how vast the difference between them! — <HI>One</HI> is carried by Angels to the delights of <HI>Abraham's bosom;</HI> — The <HI>Other</HI> descends in all his guilt and deformity, to the melancholly regions of eternal misery. — To <HI>the One,</HI> death is the messenger of divine grace, to introduce them to the endless felicities of paradise: — To <HI>the Other,</HI> the execu∣tioner of divine justice, that delivers them over to the bitter pains of eternal death.</P>
<P>LET then the wicked tremble at the approach of the <HI>king of terrors;</HI> but let us congratulate the righteous upon their deliverance out of this world, the abode of guilt and sorrow. — They have left
<PB N="23" REF="005268_0023_1016F2F6ABE190F8"/>
our society, for the <HI>innumerable company of angels, and the spirits of just men made perfect.</HI> — They have laid aside their polluted garments, for the spotless robes of purity and righteousness. — Their eyes shall no longer flow down with tears, nor their tongues utter the language of complaint, — all their difficulties are removed, — all their clouds scattered, — all their doubts resolved. They have obtained the <HI>end of their faith,</HI> the perfection of their graces, and the complete <HI>sal∣vation of their souls.</HI> Surely then, it becomes us <HI>not to weep for them, but for ourselves.</HI> — Our <HI>loss</HI> is their unspeakable <HI>gain;</HI> — they are gone from us, but are <HI>with Christ, which is far better.</HI></P>
<P>AND, Blessed be GOD, we have just ground to believe, that these are the happy circumstances of our DEPARTED BROTHER, whose death has occasioned the present discourse. — I am not fond of funeral encomiums; nor averse to pay a just tribute of honour to those GOD his distin∣guished by his grace, and made uncommonly useful in the world; — <HI>The memory of the just is blessed, and the righteous should be had in everlasting remembrance.</HI> To give flattering titles, I am sure is contrary to my principles, and, I think, as distant from my temper. It is in vain to flatter the dead, and I am under no temptation to complement the living. — I shall therefore only mention some things in the character of our
<PB N="24" REF="005268_0024_1016F2FCDED3A1D0"/>
deceased <HI>Friend,</HI> which were <HI>lovely and of good report;</HI> and recommend them to the imitation of the survivors.</P>
<P>HE was born and brought up in the bosom of the CHURCH OF SCOTLAND; and ever retained the highest reverence for its DOCTRINE, CONSTITUTION and DISCIPLINE. He was educated in the <HI>University of EDINBURGH,</HI> and advanced by that illustrious Body, to the highest honours that belong to his profession. — But piety is the brightest ornament of human nature; and of this he was a shining example. He was favoured with a religious education, which made an early impression upon his mind, and thro' grace disposed him to a thoughtful concern for his eternal welfare. In the younger years of life, — in those days which in the lan∣guage of <HI>Solomon,</HI> are emphatically stiled <HI>the days of vanity;</HI> he gave up himself to GOD, and joyfully entered under the bonds of the covenant of grace; and in the course of a long and useful life, maintained the honour of his profession, and adorned it by a conversation becoming the Gospel. He dedicated his morning hours to the sacred exercises of devotion; and rose early, that he might have time to converse with GOD and divine things, without noise or interruption. He was very punctual and exemplary in the devotions of his family; and took care, not only of the
<PB N="25" REF="005268_0025_1016F2FE63FFDDB8"/>
bodies, but souls, of those committed to his charge; instructing them in the principles of religion, and exhorting them to the service of his and their common LORD.</P>
<P>THESE WALLS will be a lasting monument of his zeal for the house and public worship of GOD; in the erecting of which he spent a con∣siderable part of his estate; and undertook a hazardous voyage to <HI>EUROPE,</HI> for the establishment and security of this infant society. Upon these, and other accounts too numerous to be mentioned, — while a PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH subsists in the <HI>City of NEW-YORK,</HI> the name of D<SUP>R</SUP>. NICOLL, will ever be remembered with honour, as one of its principal <HI>Founders,</HI> and greatest <HI>Benefactor.</HI></P>
<P>THERE were few projects set on foot, for the propagation of undefiled religion, in which his affectionate desires were not engaged for their prosperity, and his charitable contributions for their support.</P>
<P>IN the business of his calling, he was faithful and successful. He <HI>went about doing good,</HI> with unwearied diligence; not barely from a worldly motive, — that he might increase his business, and recommend himself to his patients; but from a sense of duty to GOD, and an affectionate regard to the lives and health of men.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="005268_0026_1016F300401E74E0"/>FROM this principle it was, that he not only visited the poor in their sickness, and administred to them, without any prospect of gain; — but also with a large and bountiful hand dispensed his charity among them. He was never deaf to the complaints of the misera∣ble; nor blind to the objects of pity and compassion: His eye affected his heart, and his hand was continually stretched forth for their relief and support. His charities were not at∣tended with noise and ostentation, nor proclaimed with the sound of a trumpet; but carefully concealed from the eyes of the world; and like the gentle showers of heaven, descended in a secret and silent plenty. There are few men to whom those words of <HI>Job</HI> may be more justly applied, — <HI>he delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless that had none to help him: the blessing of her that was ready to perish came upon him, and he caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.</HI> In the character of a friend, he was kind and beneficient, chearfully embracing all opportunities of doing good, within the circle of his acquaintance.</P>
<P>IF I should go on, and consider him in the station of a <HI>Husband, Father,</HI> and <HI>Master,</HI> — he deserves the character of one of the FIRST THREE; and upon a just comparison, will be found to have left but few equals. — But the
<PB N="27" REF="005268_0027_1016F3041EED82D0"/>
most amiable qualifications of nature, and richest endowments of grace, afford no exemption from the common law of mortality. Our dear Friend, — THE BELOVED PHYSICIAN, — is dead!</P>
<P>HIS distemper was sudden, and snatch'd him out of the world, almost without any warning. But during his short sickness, he was favoured with the free use of his understanding, and the comfortable exercise of his faith. He declared his only hope of eternal happiness, was built upon the merits and RIGHTEOUSNESS OF JESUS CHRIST, and express'd a firm and unshaken trust in that <HI>Blessed Redeemer,</HI> to whom he had committed his Soul in the days of his health and strength. He met death without terror, and with calmness and composure, re∣signed his immortal spirit into the hands of GOD that gave it.</P>
<P>HIS children have lost an affectionate parent; — his servants an indulgent master; — the common-wealth a valuable member; — the church of Christ a stedfast friend; — the sick a skilful physician, — and the poor a generous benefactor: His removal has occasioned a general grief; but has made the widest breach in this congregation.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="005268_0028_1016F306D47A37D0"/>BUT, tho' our earthly friends die; yet the LORD LIVES; and blessed be the GOD OF OUR SALVATION! Let us therefore <HI>not mourn,</HI> as <HI>those that are without hope;</HI> but pour out our prayers to the GOD of all grace, that he would raise up, animate, and strengthen others, to stand in the room of those, who have <HI>served their generation by the will of God,</HI> and are gone off the stage with comfort and applause. Let us all <HI>work the works of him that sent us, while it is day,</HI> and live in a diligent preparation for the <HI>coming of our LORD;</HI> — that when we have <HI>finished our course;</HI> we also may sleep in JESUS; and finally have a happy meeting with all those, <HI>who thro' faith and patience inherit the promises.</HI> Which GOD of his infinite mercy grant, thro' the merits and mediation of JESUS CHRIST;</P>

<HEAD>TO Mrs. <HI>MARGARET DU BOIS:</HI> ON The DEATH OF Her late vertuous Father, <HI>JOHN NICOLL,</HI> M.D.</HEAD>

</EPIGRAPH>
<LG>
<L>WHILE you, DU BOIS, command the tears to flow,</L>
<L>And every bosom beats with silent woe;</L>
<L>An infant Muse awakes her dying fire,</L>
<L>And in a FUNERAL-SONG resumes the lyre.</L>
<L>Permit me then in pensive strains to mourn,</L>
<L>Join in thy grief, and echo groan to groan,</L>
<L>And drop a tear on NICOLL'S sacred urn:</L>
<L>In mingled torrents let our grief flow down;</L>
<L>I weep the <HI>Friend,</HI> while you the <HI>Parent</HI> moan.</L>
</LG>

<PB N="30" REF="005268_0030_1016F30B0E1F3818"/>
<L>FORGIVE, <HI>immortal Shade!</HI> if aught can rise</L>
<L>Warbled from dust to the superior skies,</L>
<L>A feeble <HI>mortal,</HI> who wou'd fain rehearse</L>
<L>Thy deathless vertues in unfading verse.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>OH! speak, DU BOIS, (those joyless glooms dispel)</L>
<L>You, whom he lov'd, his vertues best can tell;</L>
<L>Say when, for oft in converse you were join'd,</L>
<L>What were the dictates of his holy mind?</L>
<L>What heavenly sounds flow'd from his breast refin'd?</L>
<L>Oft' have I seen thee, when he spoke, rejoice</L>
<L>To hear the accents of a <HI>Father</HI>'s voice;</L>
<L>To hear him soar above this dull abode,</L>
<L>And talk of Heaven, of Vertue, of his GOD:</L>
<L>What sacred flames his glowing breast inspir'd,</L>
<L>When from the world in silence he retir'd!</L>
<L>But now no more his raptur'd bosom glows;</L>
<L>No more the <HI>Church</HI> his heavenly transport knows;</L>
<L>Death, the grim TYRANT of the human-race,</L>
<L>Breathless enfolds him in her cold embrace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>LAMENT, ye PIOUS! ye religious PEW!</L>
<L>Whose boundless thoughts celestial joys pursue;</L>
<L>For, lo! the man for piety rever'd,</L>
<L>Who scarcely but thro' human frailty err'd;</L>
<L>Tho' grave religion shone around his head,</L>
<L>Promiscuous lies among the vulgar dead!</L>
<L><PB N="31" REF="005268_0031_1016F3105655C218"/>While others mourn, lament ye numerous POOR!</L>
<L>Who never unreliev'd forsook his door:</L>
<L>His alms descended like the flowing light,</L>
<L>And <HI>Poverty</HI> look'd chearful in his sight.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>STRANGER to civil and religious strife,</L>
<L>He pass'd the stages of a peaceful life:</L>
<L>In <HI>youth</HI> he flourish'd o'er the <HI>youthful</HI> throng;</L>
<L>Thro' temperance severe his <HI>age</HI> was strong;</L>
<L>No slow diseases wore his frame away;</L>
<L>He fled at once, — impatient of delay.</L>
<L>So some tall OAK, the monarch of the woods,</L>
<L>Exalts his tow'ring summit to the clouds;</L>
<L>The spreading boughs extended o'er the plain,</L>
<L>From heat defend, and shelter from the rain;</L>
<L>Till by some furious storm's destructive rage,</L>
<L>He falls, — the honour of a lengthen'd age.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A MAN so excellent who but must grieve</L>
<L>To lose; yet <HI>Heaven</HI> rejoices to receive:</L>
<L><HI>There</HI> he is gone sublimest joys to prove</L>
<L>In the gay bow'rs that crown the seats above;</L>
<L>Loud songs among the blissful choir to raise,</L>
<L>And spend a glad eternity in praise.</L>
<L>To distant shores his ever-living name</L>
<L>Shall fly unsullied on the wings of fame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="32" REF="005268_0032_1016F311E18471C0"/>
<L>CEASE then, DU BOIS, thy tears, — no more complain,</L>
<L>Nor weep an <HI>Angel,</HI> whom you lov'd a <HI>Man:</HI></L>
<L>In youth immortal, see thy FATHER drest!</L>
<L>In robes celestial, see him stand confest!</L>
<L>All pain forever banish'd from his breast;</L>
<L>Among the SONS OF LIGHT, his glad compeers,</L>
<L>He sees unnumber'd worlds, and treads the spheres.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>WHEN nature into ruin shall be hurl'd,</L>
<L>And the last trump surprize th' astonish'd world;</L>
<L>When clad in glory, GOD's eternal SON</L>
<L>Shall sit majestic on a radiant throne;</L>
<L>GOD-LIKE, thy NICOLL'S sacred dust shall rise,</L>
<L>And his embodied spirit mount th' imperial skies.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BUT can his lov'd <HI>Idea</HI> from thee go,</L>
<L>Long as the vital streams of nature flow?</L>
<L>Tho' friendship cease, and love no more inspire</L>
<L>The breasts of lovers with a glowing fire;</L>
<L>Yet THINE shall sacred last, THINE undecay'd,</L>
<L>Burn on thro' death, and animate thy Shade.</L>
