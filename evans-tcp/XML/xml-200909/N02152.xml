</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HIS <HI>present Evil World,</HI> is full of Troubles; has in it a World of <HI>Evil. Every Day</HI> will bring a <HI>Sufficient Evil</HI> with it. All <HI>Sublunary</HI> Things are full of <HI>Changes.</HI> A Great part of our Duty, and Prudence in this World, is to be always ready for the <HI>Changes</HI> which may come upon us: There are <HI>Unknown Changes</HI> of Adversity to come up∣on us. 'Tis of mighty consequence, that none of those <HI>Changes</HI> find us wholly unprovided for them: That our <HI>Changes</HI> may not so surprize us, as to find our Spirits altogether unable to En∣counter them; That when our <HI>Changes</HI> arrive, our surprised Souls may not say, <HI>I never thought of such a Thing as this! I am wholly unable to grapple with it!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002560_0004_0FDB700886B9EC80"/>
OF this <HI>Piety,</HI> the Holy <HI>Job</HI> was a Notable and Glorious Example. There was of Old a Traditi∣on in the Church of GOD; we find it in <HI>Origens</HI> Commentaries, that it was found, <HI>In Antiquorum dictis,</HI> that <HI>Moses</HI> presented the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> to the <HI>Israelites</HI> in their <HI>Aegyptian</HI> Captivity; that they might read it in their Families, and encou∣rage their Hearts in GOD under their Distresses. We are yet more sure, that in the <HI>Primitive Days</HI> of <HI>Christianity</HI> they Publickly read the Book of <HI>Job,</HI> on sorrowful occasions, and privately carried it also to one another on all such occasions. I do well at this Day, to take a Text from it. <HI>Job</HI> is afraid, That <HI>Piety</HI> would signify little to bring him <HI>out of Trouble;</HI> inasmuch as it had not pre∣vented his coming <HI>into</HI> Trouble. The <HI>Piety</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI> while he was yet in his <HI>Prosperity,</HI> is thus described unto us. He was not <HI>Secure;</HI> He did not fall into a Sleep of Security; He did not fall asleep with a vain Dream, that no <HI>Changes</HI> of <HI>Ad∣versity</HI> would ever overtake him. He now saw <HI>Miserable Changes:</HI> But the <HI>Changes</HI> did not come altogether Unlook'd for. <HI>The Thing which I great∣ly feared;</HI> This pious <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI> was not such an Anxious &amp; such a Tormenting <HI>Fear,</HI> as to take away his Easy, Pleasant, Thankful Enjoyment of his Comforts. To live always in such a Disqui∣eting <HI>Fear</HI> of losing what we enjoy, as to lose all comfortable Enjoyment of it, while we have it: this were no vertue in any Man; it were a <HI>sore Judgment</HI> of GOD upon a Man. But the <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Job,</HI> was a <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Caution;</HI> a <HI>Fear</HI> that put him upon <HI>Sacrificing</HI> to GOD every Day; a <HI>Fear</HI> that
<PB N="3" REF="002560_0005_0FDB700A074075E8"/>caus'd him to entertain the <HI>Changes</HI> that came up∣on him, with a Ready <HI>Resignation,</HI> and upon them to say, <HI>Blessed be the Name of the LORD!</HI> He could not foresee the particular <HI>Changes</HI> that hap∣pened unto him: It was enough, That in the midst of his <HI>Prosperity</HI> he often thought, <HI>I do not know what may happen:</HI> And he did <HI>Fear</HI> the worst that could happen.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Lesson of Piety</HI> to be now recommended unto us, is this;
<Q><HI>WE have Reason to Live in a continual Expecta∣tion of Troublesome Changes; and make such a Religious Preparation for them, that we may be able suitably to bear all the Troubles of our Changes.</HI></Q></P>
<P>IT will be our <HI>Wisdom,</HI> to be <HI>always Ready</HI> for sorrowful <HI>Changes:</HI> to be in such a <HI>Readiness</HI> for them, as may abate the Sorrows of the <HI>Changes.</HI> We may be at present in <HI>Prosperity;</HI> or at least we may have many <HI>Comfortable Possessions</HI> about us. Well, but we should have a <HI>Fear,</HI> that some <HI>Changes</HI> may be near unto us, a Devout <HI>Fear,</HI> that things will not continue long just as they are; an Holy <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which may produce in us a Temper, that shall entertain what befalls us, with all due composedness of Mind, &amp; <HI>Resignation.</HI> We should be so Apprehensive of all sorts of <HI>Changes,</HI> that whatever befalls us, we may be able, with some Quietness of Soul to say; <Q>'Tis no other than the <HI>Thing which I fear'd,</HI> that is come upon me; I am not <HI>surprised</HI> at it; It is no worse than what I have long been <HI>looking for.</HI></Q></P>
<P>OUR <HI>Duty &amp; Interest</HI> is disposed into Two Ar∣ticles;
<PB N="4" REF="002560_0006_0FDB700BDD837738"/>An <HI>Expectation</HI> of <HI>Changes,</HI> and a <HI>Prepara∣tion</HI> for <HI>Changes.</HI> But these, as our <HI>Duty &amp; Interest</HI> themselves, are sweetly <HI>Incorporated.</HI> They are very near to each other; They always <HI>go together;</HI> They are one and the same: Tho' they may be distinctly considered.</P>
<P><HI>I.</HI> WE have Reason to Live in a continual <HI>Ex∣pectation</HI> of <HI>Troublesome Changes;</HI> To <HI>Fear Changes,</HI> as things that are very likely to come upon us.</P>
<P>WE will Enquire; First, What <HI>Reason</HI> have we to Live <HI>Expecting</HI> of <HI>Troublesome Changes?</HI> The First Answer shall be; Where <HI>do we Live?</HI> In∣deed, if we were got safe to <HI>Heaven,</HI> we were then got beyond all <HI>Troublesome Changes.</HI> Of them that are got out of this World, into a better, we read, Rev. XIV. 13. <HI>They Rest from their Labours.</HI> Even so, They <HI>Rest from then Changes.</HI> When <HI>Death,</HI> which is our <HI>great Change,</HI> has come upon a Child of God, he shall find it his <HI>Last Change;</HI> that is to say, the last that will have any Trouble in it. It is true, There is a <HI>Change</HI> to be Expected <HI>after Death;</HI> The <HI>Resurrection of the Dead,</HI> will be a wondrous &amp; an Happy <HI>Change</HI> upon them. It is of that <HI>Change,</HI> that we read; Job 14.14. <HI>I will wait until my Change come.</HI> But the Saint shall never see any <HI>Troublesome Change</HI> after <HI>Death.</HI> In the mean time, while we Live in <HI>this World,</HI> we are in a World full of <HI>Changes.</HI> Nothing in this World is <HI>Constant,</HI> but the <HI>Inconstancy</HI> of the World. In the <HI>Natural World,</HI> there are continual Changes. We read; Psal. LXXIV. 16, 17. <HI>Day &amp; Night, Sum∣mer &amp; Winter.</HI> And the <HI>Political World,</HI> has as many <HI>Changes.</HI> The <HI>Vicissitudes</HI> in the World are ad∣mirable. All things are in <HI>Motion.</HI> Things can∣not
<PB N="5" REF="002560_0007_0FDB700BDFFA0900"/>continue long in <HI>one Posture.</HI> The condition of Things in this World, is compared unto that of <HI>Wheels.</HI> In the Visions of the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> we have <HI>Wheels</HI> assigned unto all the <HI>Four Empires</HI> of the World; and all the <HI>Four</HI> Quarters of it. All Things are upon <HI>Wheels; Nations</HI> find it so; And <HI>Persons</HI> find it so. It is the Fate, both of <HI>Crowns</HI> and of <HI>Spades.</HI> The Victorious King of <HI>Aegypt</HI> had his Chariot drawn by Four Captive Princes. One of them kept looking very Atten∣tively on the Wheels of the Chariot, and when the King <HI>Sesostrys,</HI> ask'd him, What he saw there; Sir, said he, <HI>I see, that what is now uppermost soon becomes undermost! I see, 'tis a Rolling sort of a World that we live in!</HI> Indeed, who sees it not? It is not until the <HI>World to come,</HI> that we shall Re∣ceive the <HI>Kingdom that cannot be moved.</HI> While we are in such a World, we are mad, if we don't Expect <HI>Changes</HI> every Moment! Where is there any one Person free from this <HI>Common Lot</HI> of the World! The Experience of all the Men in the World, cries aloud unto us: <Q><HI>Behold, Changes! Changes upon all the World!</HI></Q> In this universal <HI>Experience,</HI> we may see <HI>Reason</HI> enough to Expect <HI>Changes</HI> upon us. <HI>Man,</HI> Why shouldest thou Ex∣pect an Exemption from the <HI>Common Lot</HI> of the World!</P>
<P>BUT then, Secondly. Our <HI>Sin,</HI> makes us De∣serve <HI>Troublesome Changes;</HI> it makes us worthy of all sorts of <HI>Troubles.</HI> Man was at first created a <HI>Changeable Creature:</HI> It was fit he should be so. This was the occasion of his first <HI>Falling into Sin.</HI> Since our <HI>Fall into Sin,</HI> we are now obnoxious to
<PB N="6" REF="002560_0008_0FDB7011D0DE1D80"/>all kinds of <HI>Troublesome Changes.</HI> Our <HI>Changes</HI> are part of the <HI>Death,</HI> which is the <HI>Wages of Sin.</HI> It it because we have Sinned, that we make that Complaint, Job X. 17. <HI>Witnesses against me, — Indignation upon me, — Changes against me.</HI> Our <HI>Changes</HI> are oftentimes <HI>Witnesses</HI> of the Divine <HI>In∣dignation</HI> against us, for our Follies We do <HI>Change our Gl<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI> We Forsake the <HI>Unchangeable GOD.</HI> We pursue a <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in Objects, which are so liable to <HI>Changes,</HI> that they cannot <HI>Satisfy.</HI> We must Expect that we shall be <HI>Pun∣ished</HI> with <HI>Changes. Changes</HI> with <HI>Troubles,</HI> how proper a <HI>Punishment</HI> are they for us! We are at∣tended with no <HI>Comforts,</HI> but we are too <HI>Unthank∣ful</HI> for them, we are too <HI>Unfruitful</HI> with them, we grievously <HI>Forfeit</HI> them. We may justly Ex∣pect <HI>Changes</HI> every day, to take away those <HI>Com∣forts,</HI> which we don't improve to the Glory of GOD, as we ought to do.</P>
<P>Thirdly. TO <HI>Expect Changes,</HI> is the way to <HI>Prevent Changes,</HI> that they shall not come, or to <HI>Sweeten Changes,</HI> when they come. It is often so, That the <HI>Expectation</HI> of <HI>Changes,</HI> proves our <HI>Deli∣verance</HI> from them. Tho' the World usually proves <HI>worse than we hope,</HI> yet it usually proves also <HI>Better than we fear.</HI> 'Tis true, <HI>Job</HI> could say, <HI>The Thing which I greatly feared, is come upon me.</HI> But then, he speaks of the case, as a <HI>Rare case;</HI> he wonders at it, that it should be so. 'Tis most frequently otherwise; The <HI>Changes</HI> which we most <HI>Expect,</HI> are those that we most frequently <HI>Escape.</HI> It may be, our <HI>Fear</HI> puts us on those <HI>Me∣thods of Safety,</HI> that save us from our <HI>Feared Changes.</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="002560_0009_0FDB7013074AB300"/>If we were upon the Stroke of <HI>Prognostication,</HI> would we most probably <HI>Prognosticate,</HI> what <HI>Chan∣ges</HI> a Man shall have befalling of him? I know not a more probable Rule of Conjecture than this; <HI>What is the Mans greatest Point of Security?</HI> The Thing that a Man does least of all <HI>Fear,</HI> 'tis <HI>great∣ly to be Feared,</HI> that this is the Thing that is to come upon him. We read, Psal. XXX. 6, 7. <HI>I said, I shall never be moved, — Thou hiddest thy Face, and I was troubled.</HI> What is the Thing that a Man has least apprehension to see <HI>Moved?</HI> It is very likely, That is the very Thing, which he shall see <HI>moved &amp; changed,</HI> and be <HI>Troubled.</HI> Or, if <HI>Expectation</HI> will not <HI>keep off</HI> our <HI>Changes,</HI> but the <HI>Thing which we greatly fear</HI> must come upon us, yet it will <HI>moderate</HI> and <HI>mollify</HI> our <HI>Troubles,</HI> in our <HI>Changes. Tela Praevisa minus feriunt.</HI> By being <HI>Fore-warn'd</HI> of our <HI>Changes,</HI> we are <HI>Fore-arm'd</HI> for them. Our Spirits being afore-hand a little <HI>Fa∣miliariz'd</HI> unto our <HI>Changes,</HI> will be when they come, the less Affrighted at them. We less com∣plain of those things, which we know, are to be <HI>look'd</HI> for. The <HI>Wound</HI> is the less, when the <HI>Dart</HI> was <HI>Look'd for.</HI> The Expectation of <HI>Changes</HI> will fortify us, with <HI>Patience</HI> to bear them the more easily &amp; handsomely. The Messenger of <HI>Death</HI> put the famous Martyr into no Disturbance, for, said, he, <HI>This is no other than what I have been this long while Daily Looking for!</HI></P>
<P>WE will Enquire, Secondly; <HI>What</HI> are the <HI>Troublesome Changes,</HI> which we must Live in a daily <HI>Expectation</HI> of! The Answer to this must be very General. <HI>Of all in General;</HI> Because no
<PB N="8" REF="002560_0010_0FDB701873DA3B20"/>body can tell what in Particular. The Servant of GOD could say; Act. XX. 22, 23. — Even so may we say, <Q><HI>I know not what shall befal me, but it is very sure Afflictive Changes do abide me.</HI></Q> The <HI>Contingencies</HI> of this World cannot be Numbred. And what is there in this World, that is not sub∣ject unto them? We read; Eccl. IX. 11. <HI>Chance happens to all.</HI> Let us be so Extensive in our Ex∣pectations, as that whatever our changes may be, we may be able to say, <HI>I was a little Aware of this.</HI> And yet we will a little particularize.</P>
<P>WHATEVER our <HI>Estates</HI> may be, do not presume, That it is impossible for us, to be stript of these <HI>Estates.</HI> A <HI>Job,</HI> a Rich, and a Great Man, may soon be <HI>Poor to a Proverb.</HI> Tho' we may swim in <HI>Riches,</HI> yet we must live in this Expecta∣tion; <HI>These Riches may soon take themselves wings, and flee away.</HI> We are guilty of <HI>Trusting in Un∣certain Riches,</HI> if we lay aside all such Expectation. Of all <HI>Riches</HI> on this side Heaven; we are advised unto what they are obnoxious; Matt. VI. 19. <HI>Moth and Rust, and Thieves.</HI> Suppose, that the <HI>Fair House</HI> may be laid in Ashes, or a Stranger may be∣come the Owner. Suppose, that the most <HI>boarded Cash,</HI> may become <HI>Running Cash,</HI> and <HI>Run</HI> quite a∣way from the Owner. When we are sending a¦ny Interest <HI>abroad,</HI> suppose it may come <HI>short home;</HI> and the Sum Total of the Gains of the Voyage, may be that; Hag. 1.9. <HI>Ye Look'd for much, and, lo, it came to little.</HI> Suppose all that we have to be liable unto Innumerable <HI>Casualties.</HI> All the <HI>Elements</HI> may prey upon us; and <HI>Enemies</HI> may have a commission to sieze upon what we have.
<PB N="9" REF="002560_0011_0FDB701B7574BCF8"/>We shall not be the first, if we must come to say, <HI>I was full, I am Empty; the Almighty has Afflicted me.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN; Whatever our <HI>Honours</HI> may be, Let us not imagine, our <HI>Mountain to be so string,</HI> that we never can be <HI>Degraded,</HI> never <HI>Disgraced;</HI> we read, Psal. XLIX. 12. <HI>Man in Honour abideth not.</HI> Let them that stand on <HI>High Places,</HI> remember they stand on <HI>Slippery Places.</HI> How many <HI>Mo∣narchs</HI> have been dethron'd in our Time! And <HI>Mighty Men</HI> without Number have been <HI>broken in pieces;</HI> and others been set in their head. If the cry be, <HI>Hosanna,</HI> to day, Expect, It may be, <HI>Cru∣cify,</HI> to Morrow!</P>
<P>ARE we in <HI>Health?</HI> Let us live in Expectation of <HI>Sickness.</HI> No <HI>constitution</HI> so strong, as to be Sickness-proof. No <HI>Tabernacle</HI> of Clay, so strong, but that it may be shaken.</P>
<P>WE have our Desireable <HI>Relatives</HI> Don't think, 'Tis impossible for them to <HI>Dy.</HI> I hope, the <HI>Re∣latives</HI> are not such, that you <HI>hope for their Death.</HI> Pe they what they will, GOD forbid, you should indulge that Hope. Yet such a <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>their Death,</HI> you should have, that if it arrive before your own, you may truly say. <HI>The thing which I greatly feared is come unto me. Consorts,</HI> Expect a <HI>Parting-Time. Children,</HI> your <HI>Parents</HI> will be gone; you <HI>Father</HI> and your <HI>Mother</HI> will <HI>forsake</HI> you. <HI>Parents,</HI> your <HI>Children</HI> may be soon taken from you: The <HI>Flow∣ers</HI> may be cropt in their <HI>Minority.</HI> If the <HI>Dear∣est Friend</HI> in the World should be taken from you, Let there not be cause for you to say, <HI>I never thought of this! I always though, this Friend had been an Immortal one.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="002560_0012_0FDB701CC719E6D0"/>
THERE is one <HI>Change</HI> more to be Expected. And tho' I mention it the <HI>Last,</HI> yet I would pray my Hearers to Expect it the <HI>First</HI> of any. <HI>Death, Death,</HI> is the <HI>Change</HI> I mean. Oh! let us Live in a continual <HI>Expectation of Death.</HI> It is an awful Admonition, Prov. XXVII. 1. <HI>Thou knowest not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> When we go to sleep in the <HI>Evening,</HI> it should often be with such an Ap∣prehension; <HI>It may be, this Night my Soul will be required.</HI> When we get up and go out in a <HI>Mor∣ning,</HI> it should often be with such an Apprehensi∣on; <HI>It may be, my Sun will set before Sun-set</HI> When we part with a <HI>Friend,</HI> it should often be with such an Apprehension, <HI>'Tis possible, this may be the last Time of my Speaking to him.</HI> And when we hear a <HI>Sermon,</HI> why should it not be with such a Medi∣tation? <HI>For ought I can tell, This may be the Last Sermon I shall hear throughout Eternal Ages.</HI></P>
<P>BUT thus we are to manage the <HI>First Part</HI> of our Work. This is to be our <HI>Expectation;</HI> That we have nothing here, but what may <HI>soon be cut off.</HI> We proceed unto the <HI>Second Part</HI> of the Work. And certainly, Every one will readily grant it.</P>
<P><HI>II</HI> 'TIS <HI>Reasonable</HI> for us to make a Religious <HI>Preparation</HI> for <HI>Troublesome Changes!</HI> To <HI>Fear Changes</HI> only with a Design to get into a fit posture for them. See, <HI>Psal.</HI> LV. 19. We will Explain this <HI>Frame of Christianity.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. OUR <HI>Fear of Changes,</HI> must not be a <HI>Torturing Fear,</HI> that shall Kill or Spoil our <HI>Blessings.</HI> We read of a Miserable Thing; Eccl. VI. 2. A Man <HI>has not power</HI> to taste his own Enjoyments. Very
<PB N="11" REF="002560_0013_0FDB701E5DB679D0"/>dreadful is the <HI>Wrath &amp; Curse</HI> of GOD, upon the Children of Men, when they are given up to such a <HI>Fear,</HI> as deprives them of all Relish in the Bles∣sings, which He bestows upon them. When the <HI>Fear</HI> of Losing our <HI>Blessings,</HI> takes away our <HI>Sense</HI> of the <HI>Blessings,</HI> the Lord then fulfils that fearful Threatning upon us; <HI>I will curse your Blessings.</HI> Our <HI>Fear</HI> of our <HI>Changes,</HI> it should not hinder our <HI>Joy</HI> in our <HI>Blessings; What can there be better for a Man, than that he should eat &amp; drink, and make his Soul enjoy good in his labour?</HI> It would be a fro∣ward &amp; foolish <HI>Ingratitude</HI> unto GOD, for us to <HI>threw away</HI> our <HI>Blessings,</HI> before GOD shall please to <HI>take them away.</HI> To <HI>Live in Bondage, thro' Fear,</HI> of what is coming upon us.</P>
<P N="2">2 BUT yet, by our <HI>Fear</HI> of <HI>Changes,</HI> we should come to sit more loose from all our <HI>Comforts.</HI> We are thus advised; 1 Cor VII. 29, 30. <HI>The Time is short: — Be as tho' not</HI> —. Even so; since we may Expect <HI>Changes,</HI> let this <HI>Expectation</HI> produce in us, a due <HI>Mortification.</HI> We should grow very <HI>Mortifi'd &amp; Indifferent</HI> unto all our <HI>Comforts</HI> in this World; because we may fear <HI>Changes</HI> a coming on our <HI>Comforts.</HI> We should Hold no∣thing <HI>too fast.</HI> Why, we know not how soon every thing may by some <HI>Deadly Changes</HI> be snatched and fetch'd away from us. Write upon all our Enjoyments, <HI>Uncertain Things! Vanishing Things! Departing Things!</HI> And let this <HI>Lower the price</HI> of them. Of those Enjoyments for which we have most of Tenderness, let us Remember, <HI>They will not stay with us!</HI> When any thing is getting too far into our Affections, Let us <HI>cool</HI> our Immode∣rate
<PB N="12" REF="002560_0014_0FDB702589FEBF10"/>and Inordinate Affections, with this conside∣ration; <Q><HI>I do not know, what Changes may come, and how soon these Enjoyments may be taken away.</HI></Q> Oh! let your <HI>Moderation</HI> in every thing, be <HI>known unto all Men; A Change is at hand.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. SINCE we may <HI>Fear Troublesome Changes,</HI> Let this <HI>Fear</HI> awaken us to get into such a condi∣tion, that we shall <HI>Suffer no real Damage</HI> by any of our <HI>Changes.</HI> Oh! happy condition, in the midst of all <HI>Troublesome Changes!</HI> Oh! <HI>Beneficial Changes,</HI> the <HI>Fear</HI> whereof shall drive us into such a condition. Let us heartily consent unto the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD, and of Grace, in all the propo∣sals of it. Let us Accept of our Lord JESUS CHRIST as our <HI>Saviour,</HI> and <HI>Leader,</HI> and <HI>Ruler,</HI> and of GOD in Him, as our <HI>Portion.</HI> Let us with Souls Renouncing all the ways of Sin, and Re∣pairing to the CHRIST of GOD, cry out, <HI>Lord, I am Thine, Save me!</HI> Then we need <HI>Fear</HI> no Changes. For, whatever <HI>Changes</HI> now come upon us, we need not be <HI>afraid</HI> of any <HI>Damage</HI> from them. The Voice of the Good GOD unto us, now is that; Jer. XXV. 6. <HI>I will do you no Hurt.</HI> All the <HI>Changes</HI> that now pass over us, will be <HI>Servi∣ceable</HI> to us; They will only bring us nearer to GOD, only make us Fitter for <HI>Heaven.</HI> That Promise will be fulfill'd unto us; Rom. VIII. 28. <HI>All things shall work together for Good.</HI> And what∣ever be <HI>taken from</HI> us in any of our <HI>Changes,</HI> yet now we have <HI>Lest unto us,</HI> what will make up the want of all that is taken from us; what is infi∣nitely <HI>better</HI> than all that is taken from us.

<PB N="13" REF="002560_0015_0FDB7026B760C5E8"/><HI>Changes!</HI> Do your worst, we are Happy, we are Happy, you cannot Rob us of our Happiness.</P>
<P N="4">WE <HI>Expect Changes,</HI> we know not what <HI>Changes;</HI> Let us <HI>commit</HI> all our concerns into the Hands of a <HI>Faithful</HI> GOD, that He may order all our <HI>Changes</HI> in very Faithfulness. It was acknow∣ledged, Psal. XXXI. 15. <HI>My Times are in Thy Hands.</HI> The <HI>Times</HI> of all our <HI>Changes,</HI> and all the <HI>Changes</HI> that are to pass over us in our <HI>Times,</HI> are in the Hands of GOD. Let us leave all in those Glori∣ous Hands. The Psalmist could say, Psal. LVI. 3. <HI>At whatsoever Time I am afraid, I will put my Trust in Thee.</HI> Are we <HI>Afraid</HI> of <HI>Changes?</HI> Let us cheer∣fully <HI>Trust GOD</HI> with all our concerns; and put our Trust in Him, that He will permit no <HI>Changes</HI> but what shall be Good for us, to befall us in any of our concerns. Humbly put over all into the Hands of a Glorious CHRIST, who is the <HI>Gover∣nour</HI> of the World, who disposes all the Affairs of <HI>Providence</HI> with His Almighty Hands; and say to Him;
<Q>O my GOD; Great is thy <HI>Compassion;</HI> Great is thy <HI>Faithfulness;</HI> I put over all my <HI>In∣terests</HI> into thy precious Hands; There I <HI>cast</HI> them; There I <HI>leave</HI> them: Oh! Let thy mar∣vellous <HI>Compassion,</HI> thy infinite <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> or∣der all the <HI>Changes</HI> that are to come upon me!</Q></P>
<P N="5"><HI>CHANGES</HI> are coming on; Let us be mightily satisfied in the <HI>Conduct</HI> of GOD, the <HI>Wis∣dom,</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> of that Conduct, which mana∣ges all our <HI>Changes.</HI> We <HI>greatly Fear</HI> many <HI>Chan∣ges.</HI> We may be greatly assured, that not the least of those Changes can befall us, without the will of GOD. We read, Matth. X. 29, 30. <HI>Not a
<PB N="14" REF="002560_0016_0FDB70280FD3C9D0"/>Sparrow falls without the will of our Father; — The very Hatrs of our Heads are numbred.</HI> All our <HI>Changes</HI> are under the <HI>conduct</HI> of GOD. And anon when the <HI>Great change</HI> of Mortality comes upon a Man; <HI>Lord, Thou changest his countenance, and sendest him away.</HI> But Oh! Let us be deeply affected with the <HI>Wisdom &amp; Goodness</HI> of this Con∣duct.</P>
<P>Think;
<Q><HI>Changes</HI> are coming upon me; but they are such as the <HI>All-wise GOD</HI> sees Fit for me. It is fit, It is fit, that I should leave all to His Determination. <HI>Lord, Thy Understanding is infinite!</HI></Q></P>
<P>Think again;
<Q><HI>Changes</HI> are coming upon me; but they will be no other than <HI>GOD has meant unto Good.</HI> The <HI>Good</HI> GOD knows that it is my desire to Seek Him, and Serve Him: He is my <HI>Father,</HI> and will not let any thing befal me, that shall do me any <HI>real Harm</HI> in my Serving of Him.</Q></P>
<P N="6">WE are to meet with <HI>Changes,</HI> and look for <HI>Changes;</HI> But let us own the <HI>Favour</HI> of GOD in it, that He keeps us <HI>Ignorant</HI> of what <HI>hanges</HI> we are to meet withal. It is an <HI>Useful</HI> Ignorance: an <HI>Holesome</HI> Ignorance; If we should certainly <HI>Know aforehand,</HI> what particular <HI>Changes</HI> are appointed for us; how uneasy should we be! Our <HI>Trouble∣some Changes,</HI> would give us as much <HI>Trouble</HI> be∣fore they come, as when they come. Every <HI>Trou∣ble</HI> would be a <HI>Thousand.</HI> It was most Excellent Advice; Matth. VI. 34 <HI>Take no Thought for to Morrow.—Sufficient for the Day is the Evil there∣of.</HI> Thus, Be not sollicitous to know, what <HI>hanges</HI> may befall you <HI>to Morrow.</HI> The <HI>Changes</HI> will
<PB N="15" REF="002560_0017_0FDB7029845AAB78"/>bring <HI>Troubles enough</HI> with them, when they come <HI>to Morrow. Sufficient for the Day are the Troubles thereof.</HI> Wherefore, Oh! Do not Sin against that <HI>Favour</HI> of GOD, which we Enjoy in this our <HI>Igno∣rance.</HI> Do not Sin against it by seeking after a <HI>Forbidden Knowledge.</HI> Do not Sin against it by a <HI>Criminal Curiosity,</HI> Enquiring after a <HI>Knowledge</HI> that is not convenient for us. Here, 'tis no Fault, to be <HI>willing to be Ignorant;</HI> It were a crime to be otherwise. Let us mind, what is <HI>Revealed</HI> un∣to us; It is Revealed unto us, that we ought to <HI>prepare</HI> for <HI>Changes.</HI> But, the <HI>Changes</HI> themselves are <HI>Secret Things;</HI> The <HI>Secret Things</HI> let us cheer∣fully leave unto the LORD.</P>
<P N="7"><HI>LEAVE nothing undone,</HI> that should be done before our <HI>Fear'd Changes</HI> come upon us; nothing that we shall too late wish to have done, when we are overtaken with our <HI>Changes.</HI></P>
<P>THIS matter ought to be a little Illustrated.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Changes</HI> and Losses are come on our <HI>Estates;</HI> We shall then wish;
<Q>Oh! That while my <HI>Talents</HI> were yet in my hands; I had more improv'd them for the <HI>Honour &amp; Service</HI> of GOD, and honoured the LORD, and Succoured His People, with my <HI>Substance!</HI></Q> Then, Sirs, Do this before the <HI>Changes</HI> come upon you.</P>
<P>WHEN our <HI>Friends</HI> are by <HI>Changes</HI> taken from us, we shall then wish; <Q>Oh! That I had <HI>made more Use</HI> of, Oh! That I had <HI>done more Good to,</HI> my Friends, while I yet had them with me!</Q> Then, Sirs, Converse with your <HI>Friends,</HI> as profi∣tably as you can, before you are by <HI>Mortal Change</HI> bereaved of them.</P>

WHEN we come to <HI>Dy,</HI> and are under the Ar∣rest of our <HI>Grand Change,</HI> then it will not only be our Advantage to have our <HI>Temporal Affairs</HI> all settled, and therefore, Let that be done Seasona∣bly, be done Importance, that our <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Eternal</HI> Affairs be then found well-settled. Oh! There∣fore <HI>Immediately</HI> Turn to GOD, <HI>Immediately</HI> Close with CHRIST, <HI>Immediately</HI> lay hold on Eternal Life. Let not That work be to do, when the <HI>Grand Change</HI> is just siezing upon you. Oh!

<HEAD>COROLLARIES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. THERE are Some <HI>Things,</HI> which are <HI>greatly Feared</HI> by many who certainly will never see the Things <HI>come upon</HI> them: And they should not be <HI>Afraid</HI> of such Things; <HI>Fear not,</HI> but <HI>Rejoyce in the Hope</HI> of what a Gracious GOD will do for them. There are the Devout Ones, who say of some Things, <HI>This is the Thing that I have greatly seared.</HI> But, O let the <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> in you, as∣sure you, That these things will <HI>never come</HI> upon you. I beseech you, let not the <HI>Rod of the wicked</HI> be found in the <HI>Lot of the Righteous,</HI> and let not the Brand of the <HI>Wicked</HI> be in any Degree found in you who are the <HI>Righteous,</HI> which <HI>no Evil shall happen to;</HI> That is to have it said of you, <HI>There they were in great Fear, where no Fear was.</HI></P>
<P>More particularly,</P>
<P>First; By some Souls Returning to GOD, and
<PB N="17" REF="002560_0019_0FDB7034C4F6FB18"/>Repairing to their SAVIOUR, this is a Thing that is <HI>Greatly Feared; My SAVIOUR will not Receive such a Sinner.</HI> But be not <HI>Afraid,</HI> O Soul, flying to thy SAVIOUR. This is a thing that will never <HI>come upon</HI> thee. The First Sinners were <HI>Afraid,</HI> assoon as they began to Reflect on what they had done. Ever since it has been so; <HI>Guilt</HI> will fill Sinners with <HI>Fear.</HI> They that see their <HI>Sins</HI> to have been Many, and Heinous, and Long persisted in, are often <HI>Afraid,</HI> That they cannot find a Favourable Reception with their SAVIOUR. But as the Angel said unto the <HI>She∣pherds,</HI> Luk. II. 10. <HI>Fear not, for unto you there is born a SAVIOUR:</HI> So may it be said unto all <HI>Sinners,</HI> even unto the <HI>chief of Sinners; Fear not, but come to your SAVIOUR, and you shall be wel∣come to Him.</HI> O comer to thy SAVIOUR; Dost thou <HI>Fear,</HI> that if thou come to thy SAVIOUR, and Ask of Him, and Lean on Him, to make thee Righ∣teous &amp; Holy, and bring thee home to GOD, He will reject thy <HI>Prayer,</HI> and make thee <HI>Ashamed of thy Hope?</HI> There is no <HI>Fear</HI> of it; This is a Thing that will never come upon thee; A LORD who is <HI>Good unto the Soul that seeks Him,</HI> never dealt so, with any that in Earnest sought unto Him. Hast thou not the word of thy SAVIOUR for it, Joh. VI. 37. <HI>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast cut?</HI> And canst thou be <HI>Afraid,</HI> that He will not be True to His Word? It is a most Heart-melting Thought, with which thou mayst be comforted. When our SAVIOUR un∣derwent all the <HI>Sorrow</HI> of the Things that were done unto Him, in the Day wherein He was <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="18" REF="002560_0020_0FDB7036427D5FF8"/>from the fierce Anger of GOD,</HI> What was it that His Blessed Soul then <HI>Travailed</HI> for? No little part of the <HI>Joy set before Him,</HI> was this fruit of His Horrid Sufferings; That He should see the Children of Men come unto Him for His Mercies. Ah, Distressed Sinner: When thy SAVIOUR sees thee come unto Him for His Mercies, He sees what His Blessed Soul Travailed for, and what He Joyfully Esteemed a Recompence of His Bitter Sufferings. And canst thou be Afraid, That He, will not <HI>Receive</HI> thee, in thy coming to Him? Oh! <HI>Fear</HI> it not. A Rejection from thy SAVI∣OUR, is a Thing that cannot <HI>come upon</HI> thee. No; Be thy Sins, of never such a <HI>Scarlet</HI> and <HI>Crimson</HI> Aspect, it cannot <HI>come upon</HI> thee.</P>
<P>Secondly. BY some Souls, desirous &amp; studious always to <HI>Live by the Faith of the Son of GOD,</HI> it is a Thing that is <HI>Greatly Feared, I shall meet with such Things as will be too Hard for me.</HI> But, be not <HI>Afraid,</HI> O Soul Trusting in thy SAVIOUR. This is a Thing that will never <HI>come upon</HI> thee. A Good Man has before now said, Job IX. 28. <HI>I am afraid of all my sorrows.</HI> The Children of GOD, and they who <HI>walk Humbly with their GOD,</HI> are sometimes <HI>Afraid,</HI> that they shall never get well thorough what they may be call'd unto. But, <HI>Fear</HI> not; yea, O Anxious Mind, Thy SAVIOUR says to thee, <HI>Fear thou not, for I am with thee; Be not dismay'd, for I am thy GOD; I will strengthen thee, yea, I will help thee, yea, I will uphold thee.</HI> One gives way to this; <HI>I am Afraid, I shall not hold out unto the End, in a course of Obedience to GOD. My Corruptions will be too strong for me. I shall not be
<PB N="19" REF="002560_0021_0FDB703841D4D770"/>able always to Resist the Tempter.</HI> Another gives way to this; <HI>I am Afraid, I shall not be able to bear the painful Things that may be ordered for me. I shall sink, I shall sink, under my Loads.</HI> There are yet more that gives way to this; <HI>I am Afraid, I shall not be able to look Death in the Face with any Courage; I am Afraid, my Dying Agonies will be Intolerable.</HI> But, Oh! Be not <HI>Afraid with any Amazement</HI> concerning such Things as these. Keep hold on thy SAVIOUR; <HI>Go up out of the Wilderness Leaning</HI> on Him, as the <HI>Beloved</HI> of thy Soul. Then, <HI>Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer.</HI> For none of <HI>these things</HI> will be found among them. 'Tis enough, that, Heb. XIII. 5. <HI>He bath said, I will never leave thee, nor for sake thee.</HI></P>
<P>Thirdly; BY some Souls that have the <HI>Evi∣dent Tokens of Salvation</HI> upon them, it is a Thing that is <HI>Greatly Feared, I shall Miscarry after all, and my Portion will be that of the Hypocrites.</HI> But, be not <HI>Afraid,</HI> O Soul always doing &amp; showing the <HI>Things that accompany Salvation;</HI> This is a Thing that will never come upon thee. Our SAVIOUR said unto some, Luk. XII. 32. <HI>Fear not, little Flock; It is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom.</HI> This is what He speaks unto the Souls that <HI>follow hard after Him.</HI> Search into thy self, O Soul, with the <HI>Candle of the Lord</HI> See; Hast thou Begun to <HI>Live</HI> unto GOD, and aim at the Serving &amp; Pleasing of GOD, above all things, and behave thy self as under the <HI>Eye</HI> of GOD, and feel the <HI>Will</HI> of GOD ever giving Law to Thine? Then, Be not <HI>Afraid.</HI> Here is that <HI>Life of GOD</HI> begun, than never can Dy. Hast thou the <HI>Good
<PB N="20" REF="002560_0022_0FDB704069A2B4E8"/>Work</HI> produced in thee, which disposes thee above all things to Love GOD, and Prize CHRIST, and Hate Sin, and Live <HI>Godlily,</HI> and <HI>Soberly,</HI> and <HI>Righ∣teously,</HI> and bear Patiently and Fruitfully Every thing appointed for thee; and Suppress all Evil frames towards thy Neighbour? Then, Be not <HI>Afraid.</HI> Thou art a <HI>Temple</HI> of GOD, and such a <HI>Workmanship</HI> of His, as the <HI>Everlasting Fire</HI> could never be intended for. O Soul, Set on a CHRIST, and Full of a CHRIST; Be not <HI>Afraid.</HI> Thou art in His Hands; Nothing will be able to pull thee out. Thou shalt certainly be <HI>with Him,</HI> and <HI>Behold His Glory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>II.</HI> THERE are some Things which are the <HI>worst of Evils;</HI> and the <HI>Uncertainty</HI> of Escaping them, renders things <HI>Greatly to be Feared:</HI> Such a <HI>Fear</HI> of these things, as may prevent them, is to be commended unto us. To <HI>Fear</HI> those Things is the way to Escape them. And with regard unto such Things, it is the Direction of Heaven to us, 1 Pet. I. 17. <HI>Pass the Time of your Sojourning here in Fear.</HI> Nay, If the <HI>Fear</HI> be such as to set <HI>Prayer</HI> to GOD into a proper Exercise; This will infal∣libly prevent them. And so it may be said; Prov. XXVIII. 14. <HI>Happy is the Man that feareth always.</HI></P>
<P>First. LET all of us, even the very Best of us, Look upon this, as a <HI>Thing that is greatly to be Feared;</HI> That we may be <HI>drawn into Sin</HI> against the Glorious GOD, by the <HI>Snare laid for us in the Earth.</HI> It is enjoyn'd upon us; Phil II. 17. <HI>Work out your own Salvation with Fear &amp; Trembling.</HI> Sin
<PB N="21" REF="002560_0023_0FDB7041A923F798"/>is a <HI>Fearful Evil;</HI> a <HI>Fearful</HI> Evil! Nothing to be so <HI>Feared.</HI> We have these Ensnaring Things con∣tinually about us, which threaten to draw us into Sin. Our Hearts are Treacherous, and from their Inclinations we are Easily Ensnared. Oh! Let us <HI>Fear,</HI> and <HI>Watch,</HI> and <HI>Pray</HI> mightily, that we be not <HI>Led into Temptation.</HI> This <HI>Fear</HI> will be our <HI>Preservative.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly. LET all that have not their <HI>Vocation</HI> and <HI>Election</HI> yet made sure to them, look upon this as a <HI>Thing that is Greatly to be feared;</HI> That they <HI>Dy in their Sins,</HI> and fall into those <HI>Hands, which, it is a fearful Thing to fall into.</HI> O you, that have never yet made thorough work of Turning to GOD, Is it not a dreadful Thing, — How <HI>greatly to be feared,</HI> such a Thing; — To Perish &amp; Languish under the Wrath of an Infinite GOD! Let the <HI>Sinners in Zion be Afraid,</HI> when they think, and Oh! that they would oftner, and more seriously and affectuously Think on, the <HI>Devouring Fire,</HI> and <HI>Everlasting Burnings</HI> which they are Expos'd un∣to. <HI>Fear, Fear,</HI> O Souls in Darkness, lest you <HI>come short of Entring into the Rest,</HI> which is <HI>Promi∣sed</HI> in the Gospel. Be <HI>afraid,</HI> lest by Delays you so provoke the Holy Spirit of GOD, that He <HI>de∣part</HI> from you.— Be <HI>afraid,</HI> lest you be overtaken <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>Damnation that slumbers not.</HI> It is a dismal <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ord, Prov. X. 24. <HI>The fear of the wicked shall come upon him.</HI> The <HI>Wicked</HI> hath a secret <HI>fear</HI> many times, that it will go Ill with him. His <HI>Conscience</HI> causes him like <HI>Faelix,</HI> to <HI>tremble</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oughts of a <HI>Judgment to come.</HI> O wretched Man,
<PB N="22" REF="002560_0024_0FDB7047BB40FDB8"/>Does not thy <HI>Conscience</HI> tell thee what will be the Consequence of thy Evil ways? Oh! make Haste unto thy SAVIOUR, — that thou mayst not say <HI>That which I feared, but was not enough afraid of is come unto me!</HI></P>
