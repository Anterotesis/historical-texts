In the first Place, When I was Young, I was bashful, and could not stand the Gust of a Laugh; but having observ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Pres<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for more than 60 Years, which has stood op<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and free to every idle Scribler, who have come off with Impunity instead of the Punisament, I tho's they would have had; I am thereby emboldened to venture myself among the Rest.
