<HEAD>THE <HI>PREFACE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is very lamentable and awful to consider what Numbers of the ris∣ing Generation, are <HI>walking in the Ways of their Hearts, and in the Sight of their Eyes, fulfilling the Desires of the Flesh and of the Mind;</HI> regardless of
<PB N="ii" REF="003153_0003_0FF080EADB66B1B8"/>
all the solemn Warnings, and Calls they have had, either from the Word or Pro∣vidence of GOD. However, we must continue calling on, and warning them of their Sin and Danger, <HI>whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</HI></P>
<P>IT is also comfortable and refreshing to see, and hear, of such Numbers of YOUNG PEOPLE renewing their baptismal Covenant, and devoting themselves to the Fear and Service of GOD; and that there are in many Towns in the Land, Meetings of YOUNG MEN set up, and carried on, upon the <HI>Evenings</HI> of the LORD'S-Days, for religious Exercises, which if under a good Regulation, may be doubtless greatly serviceable to the Interests of Religion among us.</P>
<P>IT was the setting up such a Meeting, that occasion'd the preaching of the fol∣lowing Sermons, which come to you, with all possible <HI>plainness of Speech;</HI> and O that they might in the <HI>Demonstration of the Spirit and with Power▪</HI> And they
<PB N="iii" REF="003153_0003_0FF080EADB66B1B8"/>
shall do so, if while we are <HI>speaking</HI> to the Ear, GOD will <HI>speak</HI> to the Heart.</P>
<P>I hope such as are serious and con∣cern'd to hear what GOD has to speak to them, may here find a Word in Sea∣son for them, and that may become, by the Blessing of GOD, profitable to them.</P>
<P>AND as for such who are going on in their Disobedience and Rebellion, I don't suppose many such will be at the Pains of reading them: If they should, it infinitely concerns them to <HI>see to it, that they refuse not Him that speaketh,</HI> and therefore to cry for an <HI>hearing Ear, and an understanding Heart,</HI> that their <HI>Souls may live.</HI></P>
<P>AND if any may be quicken'd and excited by these plain, serious and so∣lemn Calls, and Counsels of GOD to them, to hear his Voice, and be obedi∣ent, to engage in the Service of GOD,
<PB N="iv" REF="003153_0004_0FF080EEC15E6EF0"/>
and seeking the Salvation of their pre∣cious Souls: As I have directed such to give to the free and sovereign, Grace of GOD the Praise of it, so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would now ask their Prayers for him, whose Hearts desire and prayer for them, has been, and shall be, that they may be saved.</P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>SINCE you have been so desirous of my <HI>speak∣ing</HI> to you this <HI>Evening,</HI> I have chose the Words now read unto you, for an Introduc∣tion to what I have to speak. These Words were indeed spoken by the LORD JESUS CHRIST, the LORD of <HI>Angels,</HI> unto one of that ho∣ly Order, to <HI>Run,</HI> and <HI>Speak</HI> to <HI>Zechariah,</HI> who it seems was but a <HI>Young Man.</HI> Here was great Con∣descension and Goodness manifested in such a Dispatch of an holy Angel to carry the Messages of GOD un∣to
<PB N="2" REF="003153_0005_0FF080F1E7313400"/>
this <HI>Young Man:</HI> And what Cause should we have had to admire and adore the Condescensions of such Grace to us, if the Lord had seen it best to send His Messages to us by <HI>Angels;</HI> but how much more Cause have we to adore his Mercy and Compassion to us, in the method he has taken for the Discovery of his Mind and Will to us, even by sending Men of the same make and frame with our selves, equally con∣cern'd with us in the important Things, they <HI>speak</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o, and treat with us about.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Ministers</HI> of CHRIST, are indeed <HI>Angels,</HI> GOD has put this Honour upon His <HI>Embassadors,</HI> and there∣fore they are called <HI>Angels,</HI> in the <HI>second Chapter</HI> of the <HI>Revelation, Unto the Angel of the Church of Ephe∣sus; Unto the Angel of the Church in Smyrna, Perga∣mos</HI> &amp;c. by which the HOLY GHOST means the <HI>Mi∣nisters,</HI> or <HI>Pastors</HI> of those Churches. The Messages of the Lord are sent unto them, to be delivered unto his People, and they are <HI>to give unto every one their Portion in due Season.</HI> They are to <HI>feed</HI> the <HI>Lambs</HI> as well as the <HI>Sheep.</HI></P>
<P>I have therefore <HI>(You are my Witnesses)</HI> been from one time to another, bringing the Messages of GOD unto you: I have been often warning, advising and exhorting of you, in the <HI>Lord's Name</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI> if possible, to awaken in you an earnest Sollicitude about the <HI>One thing needful.</HI> And this is what I would in the course of my <HI>Ministry,</HI> be pursuing with you, and yet more especially, when I have such Opportu∣nities for it, as I now have.</P>
<P>I rejoice exceedingly, that GOD has put it into the Hearts of such a number of you, to meet together on the <HI>Evenings</HI> of his <HI>holy Sabbaths,</HI> for the carrying
<PB N="3" REF="003153_0005_0FF080F1E7313400"/>
on the <HI>Exercises</HI> of Religion, and that you might be encourag'd and strengthen'd herein, I am now come to <HI>speak</HI> unto you: And I hope you are come hither with serious Desires to hear what GOD the Lord will now <HI>speak.</HI></P>
<P>I look upon my self, as having received this Di∣rection and Order from Him, in whose <HI>Name I speak; Run, Speak to this Young Man.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Doctrine</HI> from which I will speak unto you, shall be this.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT there are many Things to be spoken to Young People, which the Ministers of CHRIST, should be speedy and earnest in the speaking of unto them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>RUN, Speak to this Young Man:</HI> It evidently hints to us, how <HI>speedy</HI> and <HI>earnest</HI> he was to be in deliver∣ing the Messages of the Lord unto him: And so should the Ministers of CHRIST, the <HI>Angels</HI> of the <HI>Churches</HI> be, in delivering their Messages from their <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Master,</HI> unto the People, and the Young People especially, to whom the Lord sends them, as I shall endeavour to shew, before I have done.</P>
<P>WHAT I propose, under this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> shall be to shew,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>WHAT Things may be proper to be spoken to Young People?</HI></P>
<P>AND then,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>THAT the Ministers of CHRIST should be speedy and earnest in speaking such Things unto them.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="003153_0006_0FF080F3D0647110"/>I. I am to shew, <HI>WHAT Things may be proper to be spoken to Young People? Run, Speak to this Young Man.</HI> Young Men are then to be spoken to, But what are the Things that are to be spoken to them?</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>BE Thoughtful. Use your selves to serious Con∣sideration.</HI></P>
<P><HI>CONSIDERATION</HI> is the first step to <HI>Conversi∣on, Psalm</HI> 119.59. <HI>I thought on my Ways, and turned my feet unto thy Testimonies.</HI> Some translate <HI>I thought, I considered, reasoned on;</HI> truly I considered, I pon∣dered, I diligently weighed: And that it signifies to reckon, cast up, to think, and think again upon a thing; from all which its evident that this thinking, is serious pondering and <HI>Consideration.</HI></P>
<P>AND this is what I would in the <HI>first place,</HI> re∣commend unto you.</P>
<P>ASSOON as you are arrived to Years of Discre∣tion and Understanding, you should improve the thinking, reflecting Powers GOD has endow'd you with. You should think much on the <HI>first Answer,</HI> you learnt in your <HI>Catechism,</HI> viz. That <HI>Man's chief End is to glorify GOD and to enjoy Him for ever.</HI> You must then seriously consider, You have a Glorious GOD to serve, a precious Soul to save, and an Eter∣nity to prepare for. You must think of what infinite Concernment it is to you, to fear and serve GOD, and secure the Salvation of your Souls, and that the sooner you set about this great Work, the better. You must think for your Encouragement, That if you seek the Lord early, now in your younger Years, you have abundant reason to hope, and believe, that you shall find Him; because He has expresly told you, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.17. <HI>Those that seek me early shall find me.</HI> And 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28.9. <HI>If thou seek Him, He
<PB N="5" REF="003153_0006_0FF080F3D0647110"/>
will be found of thee.</HI> You should think of these En∣couragements you have to seek and serve the Lord in the days of your Youth.</P>
<P>You should <HI>think</HI> how ready and willing GOD now is to shew Mercy to you, to make you the early and happy Instances of His Grace, to pardon, renew, and sanctify you, to take an early Possession of you for Himself; to set up His Throne in your Hearts, and rule and reign there, and so give you new Hearts and new Spirits, a Heart to fear Him, and keep all His Commandments, that so it may be well with you.</P>
<P>YOU should <HI>think,</HI> how that GOD will for this be enquired of, by you, to do it for you, and that it is well worth your seeking for. To excite your ear∣nest seeking, you should think how sad your Condi∣tion will be, if the Lord will not be gracious to you, that if you should die Strangers to a Work of true and saving Grace, you'l rue it to all Eternity, and it would have been better for you, that you had ne∣ver had your Birth and Education in the <HI>Valley</HI> of <HI>Vision.</HI> Oh <HI>think</HI> how distressing it must be hereafter to you, if you should die in your Sins, to look back and consider of the many precious Helps and Ad∣vantages you had for obtaining Eternal Life. Oh <HI>think</HI> how bitter your Reflections must be, to consider of the many Instructions and Counsels, Admonitions and Warnings, that were given you, by your Parents, Ministers and godly Friends; and all if possible to save you from that Place of Torment; Oh think how grievous it will be to consider, that when you were so instructed and warned, yea and entreated to be reconciled to GOD, that the SPIRIT of GOD was often striving with you, exciting you to work out your Salvation, and mind the things of your Peace,
<PB N="6" REF="003153_0007_0FF080F58B1B9120"/>
before they should be hid from your Eyes, that you were sometimes almost perswaded to be up and doing, and seeking the Lord while He might be found, and to call upon Him, while He was near, that yet not∣withstanding you persisted in your evil Ways, and would not be reformed, and therefore must perish miserably and dreadfully: Oh <HI>think</HI> on such De∣struction in Reserve for the Workers of Iniquity, and of the Aggravations thereof, until such Destruction from the Lord is a Terror to you, until you have such fearful Apprehensions of it awakned in you, as shall excite you with a concerned Soul to seek a De∣liverance therefrom.</P>
<P>LET me also advise you, at the same time, to think of, and hope in the Mercy of GOD: Think, How He has proclaimed his Name to you, <HI>to be the Lord, the Lord GOD, gracious and merciful, slow to Anger, and of great Kindness, that unto Him belong Mercies and Forgivenesses, tho' you have rebelled against Him;</HI> that He is therefore ready to forgive the Sins of Childhood and Youth, to pass by all your Trans∣gressions, because He delights in Mercy, and takes Pleasure in them that hope therein, and is willing to shew Mercy to you according as you hope in Him.</P>
<P><HI>THINK</HI> on that word which he has spoken, that <HI>if the wicked will forsake his Way, and return unto the Lord, He will have Mercy and abundantly pardon;</HI> and <HI>that,</HI> that if <HI>the wicked will turn from all his Sins which he has committed, and keep his Statutes, he shall live, he shall not die:</HI> Think on that Declara∣tion of GOD, confirmed with an <HI>Oath,</HI> that <HI>He de∣lights not in your Death, but had rather you would turn and live,</HI> and therefore thus expostulates with you, <HI>Turn ye, Turn ye, Why will ye die?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="003153_0007_0FF080F58B1B9120"/>AND then <HI>think</HI> how that JESUS CHRIST is ex∣alted at the right hand of GOD, <HI>to give Repentance and Remission of Sins,</HI> and that he came to seek and to save that which was lost, that he came that we might have Life, that we who are dead in Trespasses and Sins, may be quicken'd and made alive, that we might live a Life of Grace and Comfort here, and a Life of Immortality and Glory hereafter</P>
<P>THINK on the many gracious Calls and Invita∣tions He gave to poor miserable Sinners while He was on Earth, and the same He now gives by his Ministers unto you. Think on that <HI>Mat.</HI> 3.2. <HI>Re∣pent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</HI> And that, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28. <HI>Come to me, all ye <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.</HI> And that in <HI>John</HI> 7.37. <HI>If any Man thirst, let him come unto me and drink of the Waters of life freely.</HI></P>
<P>THINK on that gracious Assurance He has given you, in <HI>John</HI> 6.37. <HI>Him that cometh unto me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> Think on that <HI>Revel.</HI> 3.20. <HI>Behold I stand at the door and knock, if any man open the door, I will come into him, and sup with him, and he with me.</HI></P>
<P>THINK, how CHRIST has been standing for some considerable time, as young as you are, knocking by His Word, Spirit and Ministers, at the doors of your Souls for Entrance: By that and the other Word, as such and such a time, CHRIST knock'd at the door of your Soul, He call'd upon you to arise and let Him in, that He might no longer stand without; and by such and such a Providence, by such a Sickness, or the Deaths of others, it may be, some sudden Death of that or the other young Person, CHRIST has
<PB N="8" REF="003153_0008_0FF080F94FB15968"/>
knock'd again at the door of your Soul for Entrance: Oh think of these loud Calls you have had to open to CHRIST, and no longer shut him out of your Souls, and then think of your Sloth and Sluggishness, in re∣fusing to awake and arise, and seek to Him for Light and Life; how you have made him stand without, and wait on you, till His Head has been wet with the Dew, and His Locks with the drops of the Night; how you have sent Him away griev'd to see you refuse a Compliance with His gracious Calls to you.</P>
<P>THINK, how his Bowels have notwithstanding yern'd towards you, how His <HI>Heart has been turned within Him, and his Repentings kindled together,</HI> to think of <HI>gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> you up,</HI> therefore He is yet wait∣ing on you that He may be gracious to you.</P>
<P>THINK of the Mercy of GOD to you in sending Men, of the same Make and Frame with your selves, to treat with you in the most plain and familiar way, about the important Concerns of your Souls and E∣ternity; that you may have easy Access to them, and be directed and assisted in your way to the heavenly Kingdom.</P>
<P>THINK, how your dear <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>faithful Friends</HI> are travailing in Birth for you again, until they can see CHRIST formed in your Souls.</P>
<P>THINK of the early Consecration your <HI>Parents</HI> made of you to GOD, how they solemnly devoted you to the Service of GOD the FATHER, SON and HOLY GHOST, in the <HI>sacred Baptism</HI> administer'd to you, and have been frequently since, renewing the Dedication of you to GOD, in their fervent Prayers for you: Think, how often they have carry'd you
<PB N="9" REF="003153_0008_0FF080F94FB15968"/>
in the arms of their Faith and Prayer to GOD, begging His Pity and Mercy to you, that you might live before Him, that you might have your Hearts seasoned with His Fear, that GOD would give you a Heart to seek and serve Him in your early Days, that He would be your GOD, and the guide of your Youth, that you might be preserv'd from every Path of the Destroyer, and never forget the Covenant of your GOD, nor forsake the Guide of your Youth, that you might, in short, be the Children of GOD, and Heirs of an heavenly Inheritance, that they might hereafter each one, be able to say, <HI>Here am I Lord, and the Children which thou didst</HI> graciously <HI>give unto thy Servant.</HI></P>
<P>THINK of the publick Instructions, Exhortations and Calls, you have had from one time to another, how you have been entreated and urged by various perswasive Motives and Arguments proper to work upon your Hopes and Fears, to awaken, excite and move you to a greater Care and Sollicitude about the <HI>One thing Needful.</HI> Consider often you must give an Account to GOD, of the Means and Advantages you have enjoy'd, and that if you should finally perish, they will all serve as heavy <HI>Items,</HI> to inflame your Reckoning in the Day of Accounts.</P>
<P>AND,</P>
<P>THINK much on that Day He hath appointed in which He will judge the World in Righteousness, by the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who shall be the <HI>Judge both of Quick and Dead:</HI> Meditate frequently on the Awfulness of that <HI>Great and Terrible Day of the LORD,</HI> when CHRIST shall descend from Heaven in His own Glory, and in His FATHER'S Glory, and with great Power, being commission'd and authoriz'd by GOD,
<PB N="10" REF="003153_0009_0FF080FAD9F52C10"/>
to be the Judge at that Day. Think how He will appear in the Clouds of Heaven, in some visible bright Appearance, that will surround His humane Nature, and how He will descend with the holy An∣gels, those bright and glorious Spirits, to execute His royal Will and Pleasure, how that thousand thousands of them minister unto Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stand before Him to do His Pleasure. And think also, how He will descend with a Shout, with the Voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the Trump of GOD, and erect, and seat Himself on a Throne of Glory, more glorious and magnificent, than any earthly Throne ever was, and He appear infinite∣ly more glorious upon it, than any earthly Monarch ever did upon His Throne of fading Glory.</P>
<P>THINK, how the Dead will be rais'd and <HI>the Dead in CHRIST shall rise first,</HI> arise immediately up∣on his Descent from Heaven by the Voice of the An∣gel, and afterwards the <HI>wicked</HI> also, for both must appear before the Judgment-seat of CHRIST. Think how incorruptible, immortal and glorious the Bodies of the Saints will be, and how frightful the Appearance of the Bodies of the Wicked, and the ignominious State they'l arise in, with all the marks of the divine Curse, visible upon them: Think how they will tremble to appear before GOD, and dread to be drag'd away to His Bar, to their everlasting Shame and Contempt.</P>
<P>THINK, how that when the Judgment is set CHRIST seated upon His Throne, and all Mankind brought into His Presence, the Books shall then be opened, the Book of divine Omniscience, and the Book of Memory and Conscience, wherein are re∣corded all the Actions of every Man, with all the
<PB N="11" REF="003153_0009_0FF080FAD9F52C10"/>
Circumstances that have attended them, whether good or evil, and the <HI>Book of Life</HI> in which the Names of all the Elect are written. Oh think of the clear Discovery that will he made in that Day, to Angels and Men, of the things contained in those Books, that are now concealed from the Knowledge of both.</P>
<P>THINK, how all good and bad will receive their Sentence according to the things written in those Books; that there will be a' Sentence of Absolution pass'd upon the Righteous, that He will then say to such, <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the King∣dom prepared for you, from before the foundation of the World.</HI> And a Sentence of Condemnation upon the <HI>Wicked,</HI> according to their evil Deeds, even that, <HI>De∣part from me ye cursed, into everlasting Fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</HI></P>
<P>THINK further, how there can be so Appeal from the Judgment-seat of CHRIST, to an higher Tribunal, and that the Judge will never reverse the Sentence: Think yet further, how that when the Judgment is over, CHRIST will ascend in a glorious manner into the highest Heavens, with all the holy Angels and Saints accompanying of Him, and leave the <HI>Wicked</HI> with the Apostate Angels to suffer the Vengeance of eternal Fire.</P>
<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P>THINK frequently, that you don't know how soon this <HI>Great and terrible Day</HI> of the LORD may come upon you. <HI>Think</HI> whether the late EARTH∣QUAKES may not have been Forerunners of it, since <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Tokens</HI> are to precede it.</P>
<P>CONSIDER how utterly uncertain you are, as to the time of the LORD'S thus coming: Consider, how
<PB N="12" REF="003153_0010_0FF080FDD024CC18"/>
He has said, That it shall certainly come, and come upon you as a Thief in the Night, when you are not at all aware of it, shall come very suddenly and un∣expectedly, and therefore think, it may for ought I know, come very speedily. Oh! <HI>Think</HI> then, What Preparation you are in, and what Provision you have made for such a Day, that so you might escape the Things that may come to pass, and stand before the SON of Man.</P>
<P>CONSIDER, Whether you have been diligent, that you may be <HI>found of your Judge in Peace;</HI> Con∣sider, Whether you have not done many things you should wish you had left undone, if the <HI>Judge</HI> were at the Door, and whether you have not left undone many things you would wish you had done, if the LORD was thus at hand.</P>
<P>CONSIDER, Whether your Neglects of Duty and Commissions of Evil, the Sins of your Youth, the Vanities and Follies, you have too much addicted your selves to, have been suitably laid to heart, and bitterly bewailed by you? Whether your Carelesness and Negligence about Soul Concerns, does now dis∣tress and grieve you to the Heart?</P>
<P>CONSIDER, Whether you don't now wish, you had been more in good earnest, than you have been about <HI>seeking first the Kingdom of GOD, and striving to enter in at the strait Gate;</HI> that you had been more <HI>fervent in Spirit serving the LORD?</HI></P>
<P>OH! <HI>Consider</HI> how comfortable it will be to you in a dying Hour to look back upon a Life spent i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Service of GOD, in a Concern for advancing hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Glory, and your own eternal Salvation; how com∣fortable
<PB N="13" REF="003153_0010_0FF080FDD024CC18"/>
to think, you early remember'd your Creator and the Bonds of Baptism lying on you, and renew'd the Dedication of your selves to GOD, and loved the House, Worship and Ordinances of GOD, delighted in the Company and Conversation of such as were wise and godly, and would not consent when Sinners enticed you to Evil, but said to 'em, <HI>How can I do this great Wickedness and Sin against GOD?</HI></P>
<P>HOW comfortable to think, you were watchful and prayerful, careful to sanctify the <HI>Sabbaths</HI> of the LORD, and to improve the <HI>Evenings</HI> thereof in <HI>religi∣ous Exercises,</HI> that you were desirous of retaining, and having reviv'd the good Impressions made from one Opportunity to another, under the preached Word: That you were desirous of being directed and assisted in the way to the Kingdom, that you might be made the Monuments of everlasting Mercy there. <HI>Think</HI> what Refreshment you'l find in such Reflections, how you will not then repent any Labour, Care or Pains in working out your Salvation, now: Think how richly you'l be rewarded for the greatest Diligence and Pains, you can now possibly take herein. Consi∣der then, that you have no reason to be discouraged, whatever Opposition you may meet with, from your wicked Hearts, the World or Satan. And consider further, How distressing it will be to you, in the Ap∣proaches of a dying Hour, to look back on a vain, short and merry Life, spent in a Disobedience to GOD, a disregard of His Glory and the Welfare of your own Souls: Oh <HI>think,</HI> how you will then wish you had not so <HI>hated Instruction and despised Reproof, and disobeyed the Voice of your Teachers;</HI> Think how sad your Reflections must be on your Profaness, on your trifling away GOD'S holy Sabbaths, and the Evenings, both before, and after, without any serious
<PB N="14" REF="003153_0011_0FF080FFC074DA10"/>
and solemn Thoughts of the End of your Creation, and Redemption: How you prefer'd the vain and foolish Conversation of your evil and merry Compa∣nions, to the things of your everlasting Peace. Oh think, how it will seem to have them then hid from your Eyes, to have no hope of obtaining the <HI>Blessing,</HI> tho' you seek it with Tears, as <HI>Esau</HI> did; <HI>For you know how that afterwards, when he would have in∣herited the Blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place of Repentance, tho' he sought it carefully with Tears.</HI> So it will be with such, who now fell their Souls for Trifles, as <HI>Esau</HI> did for a <HI>Mess</HI> of <HI>Pottage.</HI> Oh think, if you possibly can how distressing such Reflections must be to a Soul upon the Brink and Borders of an awful Eternity!</P>
<P>ONCE more, and I will hasten to a Close; <HI>Think</HI> upon the Motions and Strivings of GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT with you, since you have arrived to Years of Knowledge and Understanding, in the great Con∣cerns of your Souls and another World. Consider how you have been awaken'd and mov'd to your Duty at one time and another. <HI>Convictions</HI> have come in sensibly and powerfully, that you could not with∣stand them, — yea, they have sometimes made you <HI>tremble;</HI> and can't you (though I hope with Grief) think how uneasy such Convictions have been to you, and how desirous you were to get rid of them, and think of calling for them <HI>at a more convenient Season:</HI> Oh think with Sorrow upon your resisting and op∣posing plain Convictions from the SPIRIT of GOD, and think what Enemies you have hereby been to your own Peace and Comfort!</P>
<P>YOU can I trust, some of you think, of the Mer∣cy of GOD to you in enabling of you to cherish
<PB N="15" REF="003153_0011_0FF080FFC074DA10"/>
your Convictions, that when the SPIRIT of GOD by His Word and Providences, or both convinc'd you of your lost and perishing Condition, and danger of eternal Destruction, and of your immediate necessity of flying for Refuge to a glorious CHRIST to deliver and save you, and bring you into the <HI>Life</HI> of GOD; that you have with the <HI>prodigal Son</HI> bewailed your Sin and Folly, acknowledging you have sinned against Heaven and in the Sight of GOD, and have not been worthy of the least Mercy, and have been enabled to such humble Acknowledgements of your Unworthiness and Sinfulness, that the LORD has been pleased with your Humiliations, and Supplications for his Pity and Mercy to you, that you may now humbly think and hope, He then ran to you, and had <HI>Compassion</HI> on you, so that there is hope of your being found and made alive.</P>
<P>WOULD to GOD, you might all of you (MY DEAR YOUNG PEOPLE) have cause to think that the LORD has been thus merciful to you.</P>
<P>BUT it may be, you think, I have detained you too long on the first Particular; I have indeed so long, that I shall have no time now to proceed to a∣ny of the other Particulars. However I will just mention them to you, and at the next <HI>Opportunity</HI> may enlarge upon them, if GOD spare my Life, and your's.</P>
<P>IF I had had time, I should have further spoke the following things to you. Viz.</P>
<P>TO be Sober-minded.</P>
<P>TO be Prayerful and Watchful.</P>
<P>TO realize the Eye of GOD upon you.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="003153_0012_0FF0810307D63DA8"/>TO avoid Profaness.</P>
<P>TO sanctify the holy Sabbaths of the LORD.</P>
<P>TO carry respectfully to your Parents and Supe∣riours.</P>
<P>TO shun evil Company, and associate with the Wise.</P>
<P>TO be inquisitive about Soul Concerns.</P>
<P>TO attend diligently the publick Worship of GOD.</P>
<P>TO renew your Baptismal Covenant, and be con∣cerned to get prepared for the LORD'S Table.</P>
<P>TO get and keep a good Conscience.</P>
<P>NEVER to grieve the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD, but cherish His holy Motions upon your Hearts from one time to another.</P>
<P>AND, finally,</P>
<P>TO prepare for Death, and the eternal World.</P>
<P>ALL these things are of the last Importance to you, and should be speedily and earnestly spoken. But I must leave <HI>speaking</HI> to you now, because I would not make these Exercises tedious to you.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, before I have done <HI>speaking</HI> to you, let me intreat you to ponder upon what has been spoken.</P>
<P>I have come hither to <HI>speak</HI> to you, O our YOUNG PEOPLE, and Oh! if I might but be instrumental of bringing you to a thoughtful frame of Soul, to think upon the things, I have directed and now ad∣vised you to employ your Thoughts upon: If you will from this time, become thus thoughtful of the <HI>things</HI> of your everlasting Peace, I have gained a happy step towards your <HI>Conversion,</HI> and if I can gain no more <HI>this Evening</HI> than this, I will say, <HI>I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003153_0012_0FF0810307D63DA8"/>BUT will you now, shall any of you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve me cause, alas! that you should, to say 'ere long, <HI>I am afraid of you, lest I have bestowed upon you labour in vain.</HI></P>
<P>MY YOUNG PEOPLE, If you will not be perswad∣ed to be serious and <HI>thoughtful,</HI> my labour with you, will be in vain; if it should be so with respect to many here present, I hope it will not be so with res∣pect to <HI>You</HI> in a particular manner, who are the <HI>Oc∣casion</HI> of my <HI>speaking this Evening</HI> unto others, as well as unto You.</P>
<P>YOU certainly have been, and are <HI>thoughtful,</HI> and will be more so, on the things I have advised to, and therefore I trust it is, that you desire to be directed and assisted, in such a religious Combination as you propose, for religious Purposes.</P>
<P>IF I thought you were not thoughtful, serious and sober-minded, and indeed concerned, that you might help forward the Salvation of your precious Souls, I would not appear with you here at this time, nor at all encourage you in such a <HI>Meeting.</HI> But I hope you are desirous of seeking and serving the GOD of your Fathers, and promoting the Work of <HI>Reformation</HI> and <HI>Conversion,</HI> as to your selves first, and then by your good Examples in others.</P>
<P>THIS is an excellent <HI>Foundation</HI> indeed for you to set up upon, and if this be your desire, we can chear∣fully pray with and for you, and bless you in the Name of the LORD.</P>
<P>SUCH SOCIETIES have been <HI>Seminaries</HI> of <HI>Piety</HI> in many Places, many have felt the good Effects of
<PB N="18" REF="003153_0013_0FF08108649AB658"/>
such a meeting together, and have had reason to be thankful to GOD therefor all their Days.</P>
<P>IT has been an Excitement to many to come and renew their <HI>Baptismal Covenant,</HI> and to prepare dili∣gently for the <HI>Table</HI> of the LORD; and a means to excite those that have done it, to a more watchful, circumspect living and walking. Of such Advantage, I hope thro' Grace, it will be to you.</P>
<P>IF you would not defeat the good Designs of such a meeting together, be very cautious and careful who you admit into your <HI>Society,</HI> don't presently receive any that have been remarkably vain and trifling in their Deportment on the LORD'S-Days, or at other times, unless there has been observ'd for a considera∣ble time a <HI>Reformation.</HI></P>
<P>OH see to it, you that are now engaging in this religious Meeting, that you are serious and sober-minded, and let it be seen in your sober, well-order'd Lives and Conversations.</P>
<P>THE Eyes of GOD, Angels and Men will be upon you, to observe your Conduct after such an associat∣ing together for the Purposes of Religion. And you will do incredible Damage to Religion, if you take to any vain and foolish Courses, any of you; see to it then that you give no Occasion to any, to speak evilly of the ways of Religion for your sakes. Let not the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of GOD our Saviour be aspers'd thro' your means, for if after this Profession of great∣er Seriousness, and more than ordinary Concern, for the Welfare of your Souls, (for that is the Language and Meaning of your stated meeting together) People shall observe you to be as careless, rude and vain, as
<PB N="19" REF="003153_0013_0FF08108649AB658"/>
other Persons, what will they not think? what will they not say? not only to your Reproach, which may possibly be just enough, but to the Reproach of Religion also, which is too good to be expos'd to any Censures, by your Means. But I would fain hope better things of you, and things that accompany Salvation, tho' I thus speak.</P>
<P>YOU must know, that we shall expect much from you, since GOD has put it into Your Hearts to meet thus together, from one LORD'S-Day Night to another.</P>
<P>YOUR Minister, your Parents, the Church, and all that fear GOD, will expect to see you adorning the <HI>Doctrine</HI> of GOD your Saviour, which you have been instructed in, and do make Profession of.</P>
<P>AND to excite You, Consider, That we can have <HI>no greater Joy</HI> than to see you walking in the ways of Virtue and Holiness, Wise for your Souls and E∣ternity, and so like to prove an <HI>instructed and a godly Seed,</HI> who shall be <HI>accounted to the LORD for a Generation.</HI></P>
<P>WE hope and beg, GOD will own and bless you in your meetings, and make them a blessed means of bringing You into, and increasing your saving Ac∣quaintance with GOD, and His Son JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>THAT He would teach you to pray, seriously and humbly, and fervently; and that He would gra∣ciously hear and answer your Prayers, and so give you Cause to say, <Q>It is good for us to draw near to GOD, and to bear the Yoke of Religion in our Youth: The Ways of Religion we find to be Ways
<PB N="20" REF="003153_0014_0FF08109EED7F180"/>
of Pleasantness, and her Paths Peace. As for us We will therefore serve the LORD; whatever o∣thers do, The LORD our GOD, will we serve, and His Voice will we obey. We will hear what GOD the LORD has spoken to us, and seeing we look for the things of which we have been hearing, we will by the Help of GOD be diligent, that we may be found of our Judge in Peace, without Spot, and Blameless.</Q></P>
<P>MY DEAR CHILDREN, If vou may be now, or hereafter, by the Grace of GOD, brought into such Resolutions for a pious and holy Life, by my Minis∣try, you shall be my Joy and Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of CHRIST'S appearing; for I shall, I trust thro' the Mercy of GOD, rejoice in that Day, that <HI>I have not run in vain, nor laboured in vain.</HI></P>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ZECHARIAH II. 4.</HI></BIBL>
<P>— RUN, Speak to this Young Man.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>YOU may remember my having spoke to you already from these Words, upon your entring into a solemn Combination for religious Purposes, and the <HI>Doctrine</HI> I then observed from them, and shall now by the Help of GOD, speak to you again from, was this,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT there are many things to be spoken to Young People, which the Ministers of CHRIST should be speedy and earnest in the speaking of unto them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="22" REF="003153_0015_0FF0810B880BEFC0"/>UNDER this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> I proposed to shew,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>WHAT Things may be proper to be spoken to Young People?</HI></P>
<P>AND then,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>THAT the Ministers of CHRIST should be speedy and earnest in speaking such Things unto them.</HI></P>
<P>I am yet upon the first Head proposed, <HI>viz.</HI> To shew, <HI>What Things are proper to be spoken to Young People?</HI></P>
<P>I have already said,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>BE Thoughtful. Exercise your selves to serious Consideration.</HI></P>
<P>I shall now proceed to consider some of the other Heads I mentioned, I should speak to, if the GOD of our Lives should spare us to this Opportunity, and blessed be GOD, that tho' He has shaken His Rod over us, He has let us alone <HI>three Months</HI> longer in His Vineyard, and given us this one Opportunity more of hearing what is now again, to be spoken to us in His Name.</P>
<P>I now proceed to say,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>BE Sober-minded.</HI> Indeed if we seriously re∣gard, and diligently comply with the Directions gi∣ven us under the first Head, it will have a happy Tendency to bring us to a compliance with this Ex∣hortation: And I am expresly commanded to bring this to you, <HI>Titus</HI> 2.6. <HI>Young Men likewise exhor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be Sober-minded.</HI> "It is a very significant com∣prehensive Word, and carries in it a Check to al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the ill Habits, and ill Courses, that are so mischie∣vous and ruining to Young People".</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="003153_0015_0FF0810B880BEFC0"/>THE Word, says one, speaks the Duty of Young Men, but it is likewise twice used in the directory for Young Women, <HI>ver.</HI> 4. <HI>That they may teach the Young Women to be sober;</HI> and again, <HI>ver</HI> 5. <HI>that they may teach them to be discreet.</HI> So that it's the Duty of Young Women, as well as Young Men to be <HI>Sober-minded.</HI> And therefore, I speak this to all the young People here present. Let me call upon you to <HI>live soberly,</HI> as the <HI>Grace of GOD which has brought Sal∣vation,</HI> teaches you to do. You must not be rash and heedless in your Walk. You must always endeavour to act discreetly and wisely, <HI>to walk circumspectly, not as Fools, but as Wise.</HI></P>
<P>YOU must resolve as holy <HI>David</HI> did, when he was setting out in the World, <HI>Psal.</HI> 101.2. <HI>I will behave my self wisely in a perfect Way.</HI> And we read, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 18.14. <HI>He behaved himself wisely in all his Ways, and the Lord was with him.</HI> As you grow to Years of Discretion and Understanding, you should put away childish Things, as the Apostle speaks of himself, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.11. <HI>When I became a Man, I put away childish Things.</HI> You must always endeavour to be under the Regulation of wise and good Principles and Rules, for your Direction, that you may obtain the Wisdom of the Prudent to understand his Way, that Wisdom that may be profitable to direct you at all Times, and in all Cases.</P>
<P>BEWARE of being too bold and resolute, and calmly hearken to the Checks of Reason and Consci∣ence; you know how frequently the wise Man urges it, on those of your Age; <HI>My Son be wise, Wisdom is the principal thing, therefore get Wisdom, and with all your gettings get Understanding.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="003153_0016_0FF0810DB665DF70"/>YOU should beware of depending too much on your own Opinion or Judgment of Things, you should in this Regard exercise a continual jealousy of your selves, fearing and being sensible, of your Proness to Errors and Mistakes. And therefore when you are at any time engaging in any Affairs of no small Consequence, or Importance to you, be not backward to take good Advice from your Friends, and those that wish well to you, and would rejoice in your Prosperity, and you should have a greater Re∣gard to their Judgment, especially if Persons of Wisdom and Experience of the World, than to your own.</P>
<P>YOU may do well to observe the commendable Carriages of others, as well as their ill Behaviour, that you may imitate those that do well, and take Warning by those that do ill, that you may receive Instruction from all such Instances within your Ob∣servation.</P>
<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P>YOU must labour after a commendable Modesty and Humility, and beware of Pride and Self-conceit∣edness. <HI>Sober-mindedness</HI> is observ'd to be the same with <HI>Lowly-mindedness,</HI> and some have made it the same with that <HI>Poverty of Spirit,</HI> on which our Savi∣our pronounces His first <HI>Blessing, Matth.</HI> 5.3. It is most certainly recommended to such as are Young, that <HI>they be cloathed with Humility,</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.5.</P>
<P>AN excellent Divine, says, It is an Observation I have made upon that little Acquaintance, I have had with the World, that I have seen more Young People ruin'd by <HI>Pride,</HI> than perhaps by any o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Lust whatsoever. And therefore let me press th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="25" REF="003153_0016_0FF0810DB665DF70"/>
upon You with all Earnestness, and it is a Caution introduced with more than ordinary Solemnity, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 12.3. <HI>That no one thinketh of himself above what he ought to think, but to think soberly.</HI> Some give this Text, this Reading, Let him think unto <HI>Sobriety,</HI> let him think himself into a <HI>sober Mind,</HI> and always keep in that good Mind.</P>
<P>YOU should endeavoor to have low Thoughts of your selves, of your Attainments and Improvements in every Respect, you should beware of being puffed up at any time, when there may be many things commendable to be seen in you; You should look more at what may be so, in others.</P>
<P>YOU should take a greater Pleasure and Satisfac∣tion in saying and doing the things that are <HI>virtu∣ous</HI> and <HI>praise-worthy,</HI> than in being commended for it your selves.</P>
<P>YOU should endeavour to maintain on your Hearts a lively Sense of your many Failings and In∣firmities, how much you come short of others in ma∣ny things, and in many more, come short of the Rule. Such humbling Reflections shou'd be frequent with you, to check any aspiring Thoughts of your selves. You should humbly and frequently reflect on the con∣tinual need you stand in of the Grace of GOD, without which you can do nothing.</P>
<P>YOU should never think your selves too wise, or good, or old to receive proper Admonitions for what may be amiss in you. You should not ever think, you have no need to be further taught and instructed: we read 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.2. <HI>If any Man think he knows any thing, he knows nothing yet as he ought to know.</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="003153_0017_0FF08110E2197A18"/>
And therefore the Apostle directs such <HI>as seem to be wise,</HI> be sure to themselves, if not to others, <HI>to be∣come Fools that they may be wise,</HI> i. e. to be sensible of their own Folly, that they may use diligently the Means for obtaining Wisdom, and be thereby the better prepared to receive it.</P>
<P>YOU should never be so fond of your own Thought or Opinion, as to despise those that are otherwise minded.</P>
<P>YOU read in the <HI>Book of Job,</HI> of an excellent Ex∣ample of <HI>Humility</HI> and <HI>Modesty,</HI> to such of your Age. It is said of <HI>Elihu, That he was swift to hear,</HI> i. e. very desirous of further Learning and Instruction, he says, <HI>Job</HI> 32.6, 7. <HI>I am young and you are old. Wherefore I was afraid, and durst not shew you mine Opinion, I said, Days should speak.</HI> An excellent Pat∣tern of Modesty to be imitated by you.</P>
<P>I might further say,</P>
<P>YOUR being <HI>Sober-minded,</HI> should further appear by your <HI>Aspect and Behaviour.</HI> The Shew of your Countenance should witness for you, that you have not a high Opinion of your selves, and have a due Respect for others, especially such as are above you.</P>
<P>I might further say, You should beware of Extra∣vagancy in <HI>Dress,</HI> that so many of your Age, do so frequently and foolishly run into. One says, "If there be any thing in the Garb and Carriage of Young People, that they may be innocently proud of, It is the <HI>Gravity</HI> of it; when it is an Indication of Hu∣mility and Modesty reigning in the Heart; for those are the best Ornaments, and in the Sight of GOD, and all wise Men, of great Price. And you will
<PB N="27" REF="003153_0017_0FF08110E2197A18"/>
find it better to be of a humble Spirit with the low∣ly, than than to divide the Spoil with the proud, for when Men's Pride shall brin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them low, Honour shall uphold the humble in Spirit".</P>
<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P>YOU must be no Strangers to the Virtue of <HI>Tem∣perance,</HI> and <HI>Self-Denial,</HI> and must always beware of a criminal Indulgence of every sensual Appetite. The Word <HI>Sober,</HI> is translated <HI>Temperate,</HI> You must <HI>take heed therefore, that your Hearts be not over-charged with Surfeiting and Drunkenness.</HI></P>
<P>YOU may be assaulted by many strong and invit∣ing Temptations to <HI>Intemperance,</HI> which you should carefully guard against. You should consider, how it has certainly been the Ruin of Multitudes, as to their Health, their good Names, and Estates, while they liv'd, and their precious Souls for ever.</P>
<P>BEWARE then of all Approaches towards this Evil, Keep out of the Ways of Temptation, and the <HI>Places</HI> of Temptation as much as you possibly can. Let your <HI>Sober-mindedness</HI> and Moderation be known to all in this Regard.</P>
<P>AND, Think often what Reason there is to fear, that many, by giving way to such Temptations, stifle their Convictions, and greatly provoke the HOLY SPIRIT to withdraw from them, and forsake them utterly. Consider often, That tho' such intemperate and forbidden Gratifications mayn't be very grievous, to you now, they will certainly <HI>at the last, bite like a Serpent, and sting like an Adder.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="003153_0018_0FF0811575ADC688"/>BE always afraid of deserving that Character of those, in 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.4. <HI>Who were lovers of Pleasures, more than lovers of GOD.</HI> Think it not a <HI>hard Say∣ing,</HI> in many Instances to deny your selves.</P>
<P>YOU must ever <HI>flee youthful Luste,</HI> and be chaste in Heart, Speech and Behaviour. <HI>For it is the Will of GOD, that you be so, and possess your Vessel in Sanctification and Honour.</HI></P>
<P>YOU must be mild and gentle in your Behaviour, and beware of being too soon angry; guard against the out-breakings of Passion and rash Anger, which those of your Age are very liable to. Always <HI>set a Watch against the door of your Lips, that you offend not with your Tongue,</HI> remembring, if you bridle not your Tongue, <HI>your Religion will be vain.</HI></P>
<P><HI>LET no corrupt Communication proceed out of your Mouth, nor any of that foolish talking and jesting which is not convenient,</HI> or not becoming the Professors of a <HI>pure and undefiled Religion.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P>YOU should endeavour to be steady in your Con∣duct, and not inconstant and wavering, for such are not like to <HI>excell:</HI> You should not be <HI>slothful in Bu∣siness, but fervent in Spirit serving the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P>YOU should endeavour after Contentment in every Condition, after a Mind suited to your State and Circumstances in the World, firmly believing, they are order'd out by an infinitely wise and sovereign GOD. And let it appear you are <HI>Sober-minded,</HI> by being moderate in your Desires and Expectations of
<PB N="29" REF="003153_0018_0FF0811575ADC688"/>
temporal good Things, as those that have an Eye to things unseen and eternal.</P>
<P>FINALLY,</P>
<P>YOU should be grave and serious in your Deport∣ment, and ever avoid that which is frothy and vain. You should ever guard against all vain and carnal Mirth, by which you may trespass upon the Laws of Piety, Charity or Modesty. You should ever be∣ware of being transported into any indecencies, in Word or Behaviour.</P>
<P>ENDEAVOUR to maintain an habitually serious frame of Spirit, and you may do well to dwell upon such Thoughts as have a Tendency to make you <HI>Sober-minded;</HI> and particularly the <HI>four last Things,</HI> which are so frequently recommended as proper Subjects of Meditation, to make you <HI>Sober</HI> and serious.</P>
<P>I now proceed to a third Particular,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>BE Prayerful.</HI> And were you but once become considerate and thoughtful, serious and sober-mind∣ed you would certainly be so Let me call upon you in the Words of the Prophet, <HI>Isai.</HI> 55.6. <HI>Seek ye the LORD, while He may be found, and call ye upon Him while He is near.</HI> It was a sad Complaint this holy Prophet made, <HI>Chap.</HI> 64.7. <HI>There is none that calleth upon thy Name, that stirreth himself up, to take hold on Thee.</HI> But yet it is prophesy'd in <HI>Jer.</HI> 50.4. <HI>That in those Days, and at that Time, there shall be many going, and weeping and seeking the LORD their GOD.</HI> Oh be concerned that this gracious Pro∣mise may be fulfill'd with respect to all of you. Be therefore no Strangers to the Duty of <HI>secret Prayer;</HI> You read <HI>Matth.</HI> 6.6. <HI>When thou prayest enter into
<PB N="30" REF="003153_0019_0FF081172B7D2208"/>
thy Closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret.</HI> You well know what Encouragement you have to be doing so, <HI>Prov.</HI> 8.17. <HI>Those that seek me early shall find me.</HI> And 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 28.9. <HI>If thou seek Him, He will be found of thee.</HI></P>
<P>LET me now then, while I am speaking to you, eanestly advise and exhort you, to engage and per∣severe in the Duty of <HI>Prayer.</HI> Let there be this To∣ken for good found upon you, <HI>Behold you pray.</HI> Im∣prove thankfully the Liberty of Access you have to the Throne of Grace, make Conscience of daily Prayer to GOD, that you may find Mercy and Grace to help you in every time of Need. Your time for seeking the LORD is very uncertainly continued to you, for you know not how soon your <HI>Feet may stum∣ble on the dark Mountains,</HI> when all Intreaties for Grace and Mercy will be too late, and the time come, when though you should seek the LORD early, yet <HI>you shall not find Him.</HI> Wherefore, <HI>to Day, if you will hear His Voice, set your selves to seek the LORD.</HI> Engage in this Duty with all possible Seriousness and Solemnity of Spirit, as firmly believing that GOD is able to <HI>supply all your Wants, according to his Ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes in Glory by</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>WITH an encourag'd Soul then, go and carry the miserable Condition of your Soul to GOD, deeply sensible of the miserable and wretched Circum∣stances the <HI>Apostacy</HI> has brought you into, as you have lost the Image of GOD, and bring corrupt and evil Tempers and Dispositions into the World with you, Hearts full of Enmity to GOD, and CHRIST, and the Ways of Holiness: And bewail it with Grief of Soul, acknowledging your Impotency and Inability to help and save your selves. And plead
<PB N="31" REF="003153_0019_0FF081172B7D2208"/>
with Him, that though <HI>you have destroyed your selves,</HI> yet, that <HI>He has laid help on One that is able and wil∣ling to save you to the uttermost,</HI> and that He would extend his compassionate Regards to you, because <HI>He delights in Mercy,</HI> that your Misery renders you the proper Objects of His Mercy, and that you shall be for ever undone, if He don't take Pity on you.</P>
<P>PLEAD with Him, how He has glorified His free Grace towards multitudes of Sinners, as unworthy of it as you are, and that it is easy with Him, <HI>to take away the Heart of Stone, and give you an Heart of Flesh, to make you a new Heart, and a new Spirit, and cause you to walk in his Statutes and Ordinances:</HI> And that it may be for the Glory of His Mercy, to do this for you, as well as your own everlasting Peace, and Comfort. Beg of Him therefore, that whatever he de∣nies you, He would not deny you an Interest in His Favour, that He would not <HI>turn away your Prayers, nor His Mercy from you.</HI></P>
<P>SEEK therefore earnestly, that He would send down His HOLY SPIRIT <HI>to convince you of Sin, of Righteousness, and of Judgment to come.</HI> That you may see the exceeding great Evil there is in Sin, be∣cause of its Contrariety to the Purity and Holiness of GOD, and your continual Danger of the Wrath of GOD, the due Desert of Sin; that you may be brought to see, what <HI>a fearful thing it is to fall into the Hands of the living GOD,</HI> that you may have such Apprehensions of it, arising in your Minds, as shall excite and mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> you to an instant Flight from it, and that you may at the same time have such Ap∣prehensions of, and Hopes in the <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD as shall encourage your Flight to the LORD JESUS CHRIST, who alone can <HI>deliver you from the Wrath to come.</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="003153_0020_0FF0811A5E5B06D0"/>
That your Eyes may be anointed with <HI>Eye-salve,</HI> that you may see, as your own Poverty, Misery &amp; Wretch∣edness, so the All-sufficiency of CHRIST to help and save you, that you may have such gracious Discove∣ries made unto you of the Divine Beauty and Glory of CHRIST, as shall draw forth your Heart to Him, as one <HI>altogether lovely</HI> and precious, and the <HI>chief among ten thousands,</HI> that you may be freely willing to open the everlasting Doors of your Souls, to receive and entertain <HI>this King of Glory.</HI> Oh beg! That He would now dispossess the <HI>strong Man armed,</HI> who has so long kept the Palace of your Soul, <HI>and kept his Goods in Peace,</HI> that He would now come and take Possession of you, and reinstamp his holy Image on all the Powers of your Souls, and conform you to his own holy Image and Likeness, and dwell in your Hearts by Faith, and subdue every unruly unmortified Lust and Passion in you, that your Souls may be∣come the living Temples of GOD, Habitations for the HOLY SPIRIT to reside in; that you may be prepared for His gracious refreshing Visits to you, and so <HI>taste that He is gracious.</HI></P>
<P>THUS should you seek and cry for the Manifesta∣tions of the Love of GOD, to your Souls, and had you a due sense of the Worth and Value of it, you would not think much of such an earnest seeking and pleading with GOD for it, nor at all wonder at your being so earnestly call'd on to seek and plead therefor. There is nothing of the like Concernment to you in the World, and therefore don't wonder that I insist upon it, that <HI>you go and s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the LORD your GOD:</HI> Yea th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>you wrestle with Him,</HI> and re∣solve that you will not let him go, until He bless you, until you shall <HI>receive the Blessing from the
<PB N="33" REF="003153_0020_0FF0811A5E5B06D0"/>
LORD, even Righteousness from the GOD of your Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE you are thus seeking for Mercy, Acknow∣ledge you deserve it not, that you have indeed quench∣ed, and grieved, and vexed the SPIRIT of GOD, by your past Disobedience, Sin and Folly, and that your Sins have been greatly aggravated, but since you have Reason to believe, you have been <HI>prick'd to the Heart,</HI> for Sin, and that the SPIRIT of GOD, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> yet <HI>striving with you,</HI> and moving of you yet to seek the Face of the LORD, that GOD therefore waits to be gracious, that you will not therefore be discourag∣ed, but look yet again towards his holy Temple, and though He should seem to cover himself with a Cloud, that your Prayers should not pass through, and that you seem sometimes to be cast out of his Sight, yet that you will look and seek again and a∣gain, as firmly believing he never said to any, <HI>Seek ye me in vain,</HI> that He will sooner or later give you Cause to say, <HI>The LORD is good to them that wait for Him, to the Soul that seeketh Him.</HI></P>
<P>THUS should you seek for Reconciliation with GOD, that you may be therefore enabled by Faith to lay hold on the Righteousness of CHRIST, that you may by a gracious Imputation of it to you, be ac∣counted and accepted as righteous in the Sight of GOD. And as you should pray, that the SPIRIT of GOD may convince you, of <HI>Sin,</HI> and of <HI>Righteous∣ness,</HI> so of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dgment to come;</HI> that you may be convinc'd of the Certainty of it, that there is a Day coming, <HI>in which the LORD will judge the World in Righteousness,</HI> when all Mankind shall be summon'd before his dread Tribunal, and give up an Account of the Deeds done in the Body, whether they have
<PB N="34" REF="003153_0021_0FF0811CF041F160"/>
been good or evil; that a lively Sense of the Terrors of that Day, may abide upon your Heart, so as to excite you to the greatest Caution, Watchfulness and Circumspection, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all the things, that shall come to pass, and stand before the Son of Man.</P>
<P>I now proceed to say,</P>
<P N="4">4 <HI>BE Watchful.</HI> You know how frequently, <HI>watching and praying</HI> are put together. You must therefore be watchful as well as prayerful. Hence you have that Exhortation 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.8. to be not on∣ly <HI>sober,</HI> but <HI>Vigilant, because your Adversary the De∣vil, goes about as a roaring Lion, seeking whom he may devour.</HI></P>
<P>YOU have not only a treacherous, deceitful, and desperately wicked Heart within you, and an en∣snaring bewitching World without you, continually endeavouring to draw away your Heart from GOD, but there is a tempting Devil also, continually laying his Snares for you, to entice and draw you aside; he doubtless understands your Tempers and Constituti∣ons so well, that he can suit his Temptations to your particular Inclinations and Dispositions, and watches all favourable Opportunities for making his Assaults upon you, knowing how ready you are to hearken to his flattering, alluring Insinuations, o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Honour, Profit or Pleasure, especially the latter, which he knows you are at this Ag<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> so easily car∣ried away by; You should therefore certainly be con∣tinually upon your Watch and Guard, not being ig∣norant of his subtle Devices.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="003153_0021_0FF0811CF041F160"/>YOU should particularly <HI>keep your Hearts with all Diligence,</HI> and not cherish any evil Temper or Dispo∣sition there. You should ever check and resist the first Motions to Sin, arising in your Hearts, and not suffer any vain or foolish Thoughts to lodge within them.</P>
<P>YOU should also guard against all corrupt and fil∣thy Communication, or Conversation, and endeavour continually that the <HI>Words of your Mouths, as well as the Meditations of your Hearts, may be acceptable in the Sight of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>YOU must <HI>finally,</HI> guard against all Imprudencies and Indiscretions in your Behaviour: At this Age, you are in most Danger of indulging those Levities and Follies, that are no small Reproach to Christianity.</P>
<P>REMEMBER frequently the Bonds of Baptism lying on you, and so the solemn Obligations you are under to renounce the Vanities of this evil World, that you will therefore violate those Bonds, if you are not careful to shun the ways of Vanity and Folly, so many of your Age, so carelesly and unconcerned∣ly indulge themselves in.</P>
<P>TO excite your <HI>Watchfulness,</HI> you may do well to consider; To indulge your selves in light, vain, and trifling Carriages, will exceedingly unfit you for the Service of GOD, or of your Generation; you will certainly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se much of that Honour and Respect that would be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tly due to you, were you Blameless and inoffensive in your present Conduct. You would hereby gain an Interest in the Hearts and Affections of all about you. You would be a Comfort and Joy to your Parents, and all that wish well to you, and
<PB N="36" REF="003153_0022_0FF0811EB7BCA570"/>
you might be hereby happily instrumental of exciting others of your Age to <HI>live soberly,</HI> and <HI>circumspectly</HI> too.</P>
<P>BUT I may not proceed any further now.</P>
<P>ONLY let me beg of you, to hearken to what I have been in the Name of the LORD speaking unto you. I hope you came hither <HI>this Evening,</HI> with this Resolution, <HI>I will hear what GOD the LORD will speak.</HI> But you will not be obedient to his Voice, if you don't now become serious, and <HI>sober-minded,</HI> and more <HI>watchful</HI> and <HI>prayerful,</HI> and if this may be the good Fruit of what you have now heard, I have gain'd another happy step towards your Conversion; and if I can gain no more this Evening than this, I shall have Cause to say, I have <HI>not run in vain, nei∣ther laboured in vain.</HI> But if you will not be per∣swaded to <HI>live soberly, watchfully and prayerfully,</HI> I shall come to you now in vain. But would to GOD, it may not be so with respect to any of the <HI>Young People</HI> who now hear me, but more especially with respect to that SOCIETY, who are more especially the Occasion of our <HI>present Meeting.</HI></P>
<P>YOU are under very particular and peculiar Obli∣gations, thus to live and walk, and while you are mindful of them, by your exemplary Lives and Car∣riages, you will be a Comfort to us; if we can have Reason to hope and believe the religious Purposes, and good Designs of your meeting <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ether, are i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> some good Measure answer'd, that there are some gracious and good Effects of it, you may expect <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Countenance and Encouragement of you her<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was with a Prospect and Hope of this, I en<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ge<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> your Meeting at first, and now do it again, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="37" REF="003153_0022_0FF0811EB7BCA570"/>
the help of GOD, I will continue to do it, so long as I can have Reason to hope, your thus meeting has been, and may be for the <HI>better and not for the worse.</HI> If you have Reason to hope you find it a good Means to make you more serious, concern'd and thoughtful about an <HI>early Conversion</HI> to GOD, and that the good Impressions that are made in the pub∣lick Dispensations on the LORD'S-<HI>Days,</HI> are hereby more fix'd and abiding on you. If you find the good SPIRIT of GOD striving with you, and exciting good Motions and Resolutions in your Hearts: If in these Regards, you hope, you find it <HI>good for you to draw near to GOD,</HI> it cannot but encourage us, to hope your meeting together as you do, may be for <HI>the better.</HI> But if we shall have cause to fear, it <HI>may be for the worse,</HI> if you are as vain, frothy and trifling as others, and walk very unworthy of your solemn Promises and Resolutions, that you have voluntarily come into, you may expect no farther Countenance or Encouragement from us, yea, you may expect those severe Rebukes, that such Apostacies from good Beginnings will call for from us. But we would hope for better things from you, and things that accompany Salvation, tho' I thus speak.</P>
<P>WE hope, that having put your Hands to the Plough, you will not look back, because if you should, <HI>you will not be fit for the Kingdom of GOD. If any of you draw back the Soul of the LORD will have no Pleasure in you.</HI> Wherefore resolve by the Help of GOD, you will now set your Faces Heaven∣ward and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Way thither, that you will <HI>strive to enter in at the strait Gate,</HI> that you will work While the Day lasts, and do with your might whatso∣ever your Hand finds to do, as not knowing how soon <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>king and finding time may be over, for
<PB N="38" REF="003153_0023_0FF08122C597FDD8"/>
ever with you. And let me assure you, you shall not find your Labour in vain in the LORD.</P>
<P>I shall now draw towards a Close with the Words of another, in a <HI>Discourse on the Pleasure of being religious</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr. HENRY</HI> in a Sermon from Prov. <HI>3.17.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>I wish (says he, speaking to Young People) you would see and seriously consider, the two Rivals that are making court to you for your Souls, for your best Affections, CHRIST and <HI>Satan,</HI> and act wisely in disposing of your selves, and make such a Choice, as you will afterwards reflect upon with Comfort. You are now at the turning time of Life, turn right now, and you are made for ever. Come and take CHRIST'S Yoke upon you, and you will find it easy: Try the Pleasure there is in the Knowledge of GOD and CHRIST, and in Converse with spiritual Things; try the Pleasure of Seriousness and Self-Denial, and you will find it far exceeds that of Vanity and Self-Indul∣gence; Try the Pleasure of Meditation on the Word of GOD, of Prayer, and Praise, and Sabbath Sancti∣fication, and you will soon find, you have made a happy Change of the Pleasures of vain and carnal Mirth, for these true Delights. Reckon that the best Pleasure, which will remain with you, and stand you in stead, when you come to die, which will help to take off the Terrors of Death, and allay its Pains. The Remembrance of sinful Pleasures will give you killing Terrors, but the Remembrance of religious Pleasures will give you living Comforts in dying Moments. Thus he.</P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="003153_0023_0FF08122C597FDD8"/>AND how soon a dying Hour may overtake you, you don't know, and when that arrives, do you think, you shall repent any present Care and Pains, about the Conversion and Salvation of your Souls; You may be assured, You will look back thereon with no little Pleasure and Satisfaction, you'l wish You had begun earlier, in the Service of GOD, and Care of your Souls, than you did; and will exceedingly re∣joice You were at last perswaded to engage therein, and were enabled by the Grace of GOD, to perse∣vere in the Ways of well-doing. Would to GOD, that the Consideration of this, might encourage such among us, as have been hitherto, too thoughtless and careless about their Souls, and a Preparation for Death and Judgment, that such may be now pricked to the Heart, and from <HI>this Evening, go and weep, and seek to the LORD their GOD, and</HI> quickly <HI>come and ask the way to Zion with their Faces thitherward and join themselves to the LORD in a perpetual Cove∣nant not to be forgotten.</HI> In this Regard, we still hope to see further Tokens of the gracious Presence of our GOD with us, at the beholding whereof our Hearts shall rejoice, even ours.</P>
<P>YOUR Parents and Friends, who are travalling in Birth for You again, are waiting and hoping, to hear of your being born again, they hope and pray, that CHRIST <HI>may see of the travail of his Soul,</HI> in your Conversion also. And shall not the Considera∣tion hereof excite and encourage more of you, to do what you possibly can, for your eternal Safety? If you will be from hence forward working out your own Salvation with fear and trembling, GOD has promised, He will work in you both to will and to do, of his own good Pleasure. What greater Encou∣ragement can you have, to be up and doing, what
<PB N="40" REF="003153_0024_0FF0812482F39D80"/>
can the LORD say, or do more, to stir you up to your Duty?</P>
<P>CAN You think GOD will, or would You have GOD, to convert and save you, while you sit still, and will not stir up your selves to take hold of Him? He has said, <HI>Ask and ye shall have, seek and ye shall find, knock and it shall be opened to you.</HI> And He now comes to the Doors of your Souls, and desires He may enter in, and take Possession of you, and will you not now arise and let him in? Must He stand now again, until <HI>His Head be wet with the Dew, and His Looks with the drops of the Night.</HI> And will you still give Him Cause to complain, as in <HI>John</HI> 5.40. <HI>Ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life.</HI> And as in <HI>Matth.</HI> 23.17. <HI>How often would I have gather∣ed thy Children together, as a Hen gathereth her Chic∣kens under her Wings, and ye would not.</HI></P>
<P>OH give Him no longer Cause to say thus concern∣ing you, and immediately seek for shelter under the Shadow of his saving Wings; Let that be your Prayer and Resolution, in <HI>Psalm</HI> 57.1. with which I shall now conclude, <HI>Be merciful unto me, O GOD, be mer∣ciful unto me, for my Soul trusteth in thee; yea in the shadow of thy Wings will I make my Refuge, until these Calamities be overpast.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE Third SERMON.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ZECHARIAH II. 4.</HI></BIBL>
<P>— RUN, Speak to this Young Man.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>YOU may remember my having spoke to you once and again, from these Words, and the <HI>Doctrine</HI> I have observed from them, and shall now by the Help of GOD, speak to you further from, was this,</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT there are many things to be spoken to Young People, which the Ministers of CHRIST should be speedy and earnest in the speaking of unto them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="42" REF="003153_0025_0FF081262C2CC6E0"/>UNDER this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> I proposed to shew,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>WHAT Things may be proper to be spoken to Young People?</HI></P>
<P>AND then,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>THAT the Ministers of CHRIST should be speedy and earnest in speaking such Things unto them.</HI></P>
<P>I am yet upon the first Head proposed, <HI>viz.</HI> To <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew, <HI>What Things are proper to be spoken to Young People?</HI></P>
<P>UNDER this Inquiry I have already said, <LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>BE Thoughtful.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>BE Sober-minded.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. <HI>BE Prayerful.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. <HI>BE Watchful.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I now proceed to say,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>REALIZE the Eye of GOD upon you.</HI> Set the LORD always before you, and at your right hand, that you may not be moved. Consider frequently, that the LORD is from Heaven continually looking down upon you, to see how you seek and serve Him: To see whether you <HI>keep your Hearts with all Dili∣gence,</HI> to observe your inward Frames and Tempers, how your thoughts are from time to time employ'd, and to observe the Words which proceed out of your Mouths, whether there be any of that foolish talking and jesting, which is not convenient, or whether i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be <HI>to the Use of Edifying,</HI> and such as may <HI>minister<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Grace to the Hearers;</HI> and to observe your whole Conduct and Behaviour at all Times, and in all Pla∣ces, and in every Condition and Circumstance of Life.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="003153_0025_0FF081262C2CC6E0"/>REALIZE the <HI>Omniscience</HI> of GOD, <HI>that He search∣es the Hearts and tries the Reins of the Children of Men,</HI> and that the most secret Thoughts and Contrivances in your Minds, are as open and manifest to his all-seeing Eye, as any of the Actions of your Lives, and that there is a Day coming <HI>in which He will judge the secrets of Men by</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>according to his Gospel.</HI> Endeavour to get the Consideration and Belief of this, so impress'd upon your Minds, that you may be able, upon the most alluring Sollici∣tations, to repel the Tempter, as that pious Youth did, <HI>Gen.</HI> 39.9. <HI>How can I do this great Wickedness, and sin against GOD?</HI> It will be for your Credit and Honour, if you shall be able to say, as <HI>Nehemiah</HI> did, <HI>Chap.</HI> 5.15. <HI>But so did not I because of the Fear of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>ALWAYS stand in awe of GOD, when you are alone and no Creature sees you; and be more con∣cern'd to please GOD, when retired from the Sight of Men, than when the World looks upon you: Dare not commit any thing that is offensive to GOD, or injurious to your Neighbour, because of the Eye of GOD upon you.</P>
<P><Q>BEAR it upon your Minds, that no Place can escape the all-seeing Eye of GOD, that there is no Corner so secret, but <HI>the Father of Lights</HI> shines into it. Remember that, that GOD whose Eye is thus upon you, will call you to an Account for secret Sins, as well as for notorious Offences.</Q></P>
<P>INDEED, not to fear GOD (says One) when we are alone, is not to fear Him at all; and He that shuns indecencies before Men, only shews, that they are the Gods whom he serves. Sobriety be∣fore
<PB N="44" REF="003153_0026_0FF0812ACE39A5B8"/>
Men only, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Sign that nothing but Credit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Interest keep us in Awe; and except we dread the very Appearance of Evil, when GOD alone is with us, we are but a better sort of Atheists. What doth it signify to believe a GOD, and to walk as if there were none? And to what Purpose is it to a∣dore Him, when His Greatness can have no Influence upon our Consciences? To see in secret is GOD's Prerogative, and we then deny it, when in secret we dare break His Laws.</P>
<P><Q>HE could not be GOD if He took no Notice of our Thoughts and Actions, when we are alone, and therefore not to fear Him when we are in private, is to say with the <HI>Fool, There is no GOD.</HI> It is a perfect Contradiction to believe GOD's Omniscience, and not to stand in awe of it. If the whole World were present with us, or within our View, it is not so much, as when GOD is present with us, when alone.</Q></P>
<P>YOU must realize, that the <HI>LORD searches you, and knows you, that he knows your down-sitting, and up-rising, that he understands your Thoughts afar off, that he compasses your Path, and your lying down, and is acquainted with all your Ways, and will here∣after give unto you according to your Ways, and the Fruit of your Doings. Psalm</HI> 139. <HI>init.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed to say,</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>AVOID Profaness.</HI> Never take the Name of the LORD your GOD in vain, for the LORD will not hold such Guiltless, who take his Name in vain. Never think of GOD contrary to what He has dis∣covered of himself, that, that Charge may not be∣long
<PB N="45" REF="003153_0026_0FF0812ACE39A5B8"/>
unto you, <HI>Psalm</HI> 50.21. <HI>Thou thoughtest I was altogether such a one as thy self.</HI> See that you never needlesly, and slightly mention GOD's Name, as the manner of too many is, without any serious Thought or Consideration; of such the Psalmist speaks, <HI>Psalm</HI> 139.20. <HI>They speak against thee wickedly, and thine Enemies take thy Name in vain.</HI> Ever beware of needless Oaths in common Discourse, <HI>Matth.</HI> 5.34. And of profane Cursing and Swearing, and of false Oaths, <HI>Levit.</HI> 24.11. <HI>Zech.</HI> 8.17.</P>
<P>BEWARE of <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> in your Professions of Christianity, don't in this Regard, <HI>Lye unto GOD with your Tongues.</HI> Beware of Formality and Hy∣pocrisy in Acts of religious Worship, that GOD may not have Cause to say concerning, you, as in <HI>Isai.</HI> 29.13. <HI>They draw near me with their Mouths, and with their Lips do Honour me, but have removed their Hearts far from me.</HI> Never despise any of the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of GOD, as they did concerning whom we read, <HI>Mal.</HI> 1.12. <HI>Ye have profaned it,</HI> that is, <HI>GOD's Name, in that ye say, The Table of the LORD is polluted, and the Fruit thereof, even his Meat is contemptible.</HI> Be∣ware of all disorderly or irreverent Carriages, in the Worship of GOD, and scoffing at, or wresting the Word of GOD, or using Scripture Expressions in jest∣ing, or in common Discourse. Be not ever so profane, as <HI>not to regard the Works of the Lord, or not consider the Operation of His Hands.</HI></P>
<P>BEWARE of all these Ways, and every other Way, by which you may be Guilty of profaning or abusing the Name of GOD. And be ever careful to manifest an holy Awe and Reverence towards GOD's holy Name. <HI>Deut.</HI> 28.58. <HI>That thou mayest fear this glorious and fearful Name, THE LORD THY GOD.</HI>
<PB N="46" REF="003153_0027_0FF0812C6FCCD8D0"/>
And know assuredly, That if you will not do so, <HI>the LORD will make thy Plagues wonderful Deut.</HI> 28.59. So that if you shall escape Punishment from Men, you shall not escape the righteous Judgment of GOD.</P>
<P>I now proceed to a seventh Particular.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>SANCTIFY the holy Sabbaths of the LORD.</HI> You know that the <HI>fourth Commandment,</HI> does ex∣presly require you to <HI>Remember the Sabbath-Day to keep it holy.</HI> Remember then the Approaches of ho∣ly Time, the Day before: Always think of that Word of <HI>Moses</HI> to <HI>Israel, Exod.</HI> 16.23. <HI>To morrow is the Rest of the holy Sabbath to the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>YOU should the Day and Evening before, beg of GOD to rid your Hearts as well 2s your Hands, of whatever may unfit, or indispose you for his Service thereon, that it may be a good Day to your Souls.</P>
<P>BE sollicitous that when you awake in the Morn∣ing, your Thoughts may be on GOD, and the Things of your everlasting Peace, that pious &amp; holy Thoughts may take the first Possession of your Hearts, and abide there, throughout the Day.</P>
<P>TAKE the first convenient Time, to retire and pray to your Father who sees in secret, adoring His Mercy to you, in giving you to see the Light of a∣nother <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and begging that He would by His Grace enable you, to keep a Sabbath of Rest from Sin, and of Rest in GOD, that <HI>you may be in the Fear of the LORD all the Day long;</HI> that His Presence may go with you to the House of GOD, that He would meet and bless you there, and grace His own
<PB N="47" REF="003153_0027_0FF0812C6FCCD8D0"/>
Ordinances with his Presence, and make them saving∣ly profitable to you.</P>
<P>WHEN you are in the House of GOD, see that <HI>you reverence His Sanctuary,</HI> remembring always, that this Place is dreadful, because no other <HI>than the House of GOD, and the Gate of Heaven</HI></P>
<P>COMPOSE your self with all possible Seriousness and Gravity to attend to the <HI>Messages</HI> here delivered to you, regarding of them, as from the LORD, and not from Man. Hear as for your Lives, and as those that must give an Account, what, and how, you hear.</P>
<P>WHEN you go from the House of GOD, medi∣tate seriously on what you have heard, and beg of GOD you may profit by it.</P>
<P>SET the LORD before you in the Time of <HI>Inter∣mission,</HI> don't divert into any vain, and foolish talk∣ing; and beware of all trifling Carriages.</P>
<P>AND in the fear of GOD, return to the publick Worship again, begging you may come with meek and teachable frames or Spirit, and with earnest De∣sires of hearing a Word that may be suited to the State and Condition of your Souls, and with the like Gravity, Seriousness and Reverence, attend as before.</P>
<P>AND go away again, with the same earnest De∣sires, of a Blessing on what you have heard, that it may become a <HI>Savour of Life unto Life unto you.</HI></P>
<P>KEEP the Day holy unto the End of it. Keep up as much as possible, devout and holy Thoughts and
<PB N="48" REF="003153_0028_0FF0812E30E4B940"/>
Meditations, to the close of it; and under a Sense of your many Failings and short-comings in Duty, fly to the Blood of the great Sacrifice, for Pardon, beg∣ging of GOD to accept what of Sincerity, He has seen in your Desires and Endeavours, so to sanctify his holy Day, as that it may be a Means of your Sanctification. Thus endeavour to keep the holy Sabbaths of the LORD here, that you may be hereby made meet for the keeping of an everlasting Sabbath of Rest, in the Kingdom of GOD, hereafter.</P>
<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>CARRY respectfully to your Parents and Supe∣riours.</HI> You should fear and Reverence them, <HI>Levit.</HI> 19.3. <HI>Ye shall fear every Man his Mother, and his Father.</HI> Beware you never <HI>despise your Parents when they are old, Prov.</HI> 23.22.

<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>SHUN evil Company.</HI> Be not Companions of Fools. Do not at any time needlesly go into, or fre∣quent the Society of ungodly Men.

<PB N="49" REF="003153_0028_0FF0812E30E4B940"/>
<HI>Enter not into the Path of the Wicked, and go not in the Way of evil Men, avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it and pass away.</HI></P>
<P>FOLLOW <HI>David</HI>'s Example of whom we read, <HI>Psalm</HI> 26.4, 5 <HI>I have not sat with vain Persons, neither will I go in with Dissemblers; I have hated the Congregation of evil Doers, and will not sit with the Wicked.</HI> And if such should at any time come where you are, and endeavour to ensnare and wound you; hearken not to their sinful Enticements, <HI>Prov.</HI> 1.10. <HI>My Son, if Sinners entice thee consent thou not.

<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>ASSOCIATE with the Wise. Prov.</HI> 13.20. <HI>He that walketh with wise Men shall be wise.</HI> Make choice of such for your Companions, concerning whom you may have Reason to hope, they have the Fear of GOD in their Hearts, and before their Eyes.

<P>BUT I proceed to the next Particular, which I hope you will give me a very serious and diligent Attention to.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>BE inquisitive about Soul Concerns.</HI> Betimes <HI>ask the Way to Zion, with your Face thitherward.</HI> Be desirous of knowing the right Way to Heaven, of

being taught and instructed in the Way of Life. Make it your Inquiry, <HI>What you shall do that you may be saved?</HI> Be desirous of knowing what the Terms of Salvation are, what the Conditions upon which eternal Life may be obtained.</P>
<P>BE concerned to know the Nature of a true <HI>evan∣gelical Repentance</HI> for Sin; how you may come to sorrow after a godly sort.</P>
<P>AND the Nature of a true and <HI>unfeigned Faith in the LORD JESUS CHRIST,</HI> of so <HI>looking to Him that you may be saved.</HI></P>
<P>BE concerned to know the Nature of a <HI>Sinner's Justification by Faith in the Righteousness of the LORD JESUS CHRIST,</HI> how you may come to be accounted and accepted as righteous in the Sight of GOD, so, <HI>that no Condemnation may belong unto you;</HI> and how <HI>the Law of the Spirit of Life which is in JESUS CHRIST, may make you free from the Law of Sin and Death.</HI> How you may <HI>become new Creatures, the Workmanship of GOD in JESUS CHRIST, created unto good Works.</HI> How you may come to be <HI>born again, born of the Spirit, and born from above; to put off the old Man, and put on the new, to have new Hearts and, Spirits given to you, to be made partakers of the Divine Nature, and made conformable to the Image of CHRIST; to have your Life hid with CHRIST in GOD, and to enjoy Communion with Him, and to keep your selves in the Love of GOD, and looking for the Mercy of the LORD JESUS CHRIST unto eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>BE inquisitive about the Nature of these and such like Duties of Christianity, necessary to be practiced
<PB N="51" REF="003153_0029_0FF08130268D4728"/>
by you, in order to your Preparation for, and Par∣ticipation of, the Blessedness of the heavenly Kingdom.</P>
<P>AND in Order hereunto, Seek Direction from those, who are to teach and lead you thither. Hear∣ken diligently to those who are appointed &amp; authoriz'd, to feed you with Knowledge and Understanding. You read in <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.7. <HI>The Priest lips should keep Knowledge, and you should seek the Law at his Mouth, for he is the Messenger of the LORD of Hosts.</HI> You should hearken to their Messages. You should hear∣ken diligently to the Counsels, Warnings and Admo∣nitions delivered to you by them, in the Name and Fear of GOD, and regard them, as the Word of GOD, and not of Man.</P>
<P>CHRIST'S Ministers are his Ambassadours, and He does by them beseech you to be reconciled unto GOD, and what they deliver to you, agreeable to the Word of GOD, you ought as firmly to believe and regard it, as tho' CHRIST himself spake to you in his own Person.</P>
<P>OUT of Pity and Compassion to you, CHRIST sends not Angels (who might rather terrify than in∣struct you) but Men of the same Make and Frame with your selves, Men of like Passions, in the same guilty miserable Circumstances, naturally, as you are, and who must obtain and secure their own Sal∣vation, in the same Way, upon the same Terms and Conditions, they propose to you; Unto their In∣structions you must therefore hearken, as for your Lives, with earnest Desires of being pric<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d to the Heart by the preached Word, that it may become the Power of GOD to your Salvation.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="003153_0030_0FF08134119D8198"/>BUT to come to what I principally aim at, under this Head; As we have Freedom of Access unto CHRIST'S Ambassadors, and they are, or should be easy of Access, so you should willingly and freely re∣pair unto them, as authoriz'd by the King and Head of his Church and People, to shew to you the Way of Salvation, especially if you are at any time un∣der Convictions, and have good Impressions upon your Minds caused by the Word or Providences of GOD.</P>
<P>IF you evidently perceive the SPIRIT of GOD is striving with you, and a serious Concern is awaken'd about your Soul, and Eternity, you should improve every such happy Season to go to such, and acquaint them with your <HI>Case,</HI> and desire their Advice and Counsel, that such Convictions may have a good Issue.</P>
<P>YOU should look on this to be a Way of GOD, an Ordinance of GOD appointed for your Good, and with such a View, attend it, and not any longer cherish such a criminal Backwardness to your Duty in this Regard.</P>
<P>WHEN you are really concern'd about the State of your Soul, and what is like to become of you to all Eternity, and are desirous of knowing what the LORD would have you to do, you should at such a Time, with Freedom and Resolution, go and open your Case, unbosom your self to some faithful godly Friend, or Minister, and ask their Direction and Help and Thoughts upon your <HI>Case.</HI></P>
<P>I am verily afraid, that many Convictions have been lost, and Impressions defac'd, and worn off, for want of taking this Method.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="003153_0030_0FF08134119D8198"/>IF when you were under C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>tions, and Con∣cern of Soul about your spiritual State, you had comply'd with your Duty in this Regard, it would have had a happy Tendency to have cherish'd and set home your Convictions, and so have help'd for∣ward your <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD. May the Conside∣ration and Hope of this encourage you to do so, under the Convictions and Impressions, you may have upon your Minds, for time to come.</P>
<P>I now proceed to another Particular.</P>
<P>LET me advise you while I am speaking to you, <HI>to attend diligently the publick Worship of GOD. For∣sake not the House of GOD, and the assembling of your selves together, as the manner of some is.</HI> Make Conscience of coming up to the House of GOD, when you have Health and Ability for it. Don't let any trifling matter divert or hinder you: Such Oppor∣tunities are most uncertainly continued to you; im∣prove them diligently, while you may, that you may reflect thereon with Comfort in days to come.</P>
<P>LET me advise you in the next Place,</P>
<P><HI>TO renew your baptismal Covenant.</HI> You are (I suppose all of you) the baptized Disciples of the LORD JESUS CHRIST. You were early dedicated to GOD, in the holy Ordinance of <HI>Baptism,</HI> and now, when you come to Years of Discretion, and Under∣standing, you should make it your own Act and Deed.</P>
<P>YOU are taught by the Apostle, <HI>Gal.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.3.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>That as many of you, as have been baptized into CHRIST, have put on CHRIST, i. e.</HI> have put on the Name of
<PB N="54" REF="003153_0031_0FF0813712A4C808"/>
Disciples and Followers of CHRIST, and are therefore obliged to make such publick Profession, and explicitly own and avouch the LORD to be Your GOD, and not be afraid or asham'd to acknowledge the Truths and Ways of CHRIST. If you do not do so, how will you frustrate the great Design of your Baptism, by which you became so early engaged to <HI>seek and serve the GOD of your Fathers?</HI></P>
<P>AND how can you expect, or hope for the Bles∣sings of the <HI>Covenant,</HI> if you will not lay hold upon it, consent to the Terms of it, and walk according to the Tenour of it? You should then most cer∣tainly not content your selves, with the <HI>Dedication</HI> your Parents made of you to GOD, at your Baptism, but renew and take upon you, your <HI>baptismal Vow</HI> and Covenant, solemnly promising by his Grace help∣ing of you, that <HI>you will fear GOD, and keep his Commandments always, that it may be well with you for ever.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, you are very thoughtful of your Duty, in this respect, such of you, as have not yet done it, and that your religious Exercises, from one Week to another, will have a good Tendency to prepare you for, and excite and quicken you to it.</P>
<P>LET me advise you in the next Place,</P>
<P><HI>TO be concern'd to get prepared for the LORD's Table.</HI> The Invitation is made unto you, as well as those that are in their elder Years, to come and shew forth CHRIST'S Death and Sufferings in Remembrance of Him. <HI>This do in Remembrance of me,</HI> obliges <HI>you</HI> as well as others, and while you neglect to do it, you live in the Omission of a plain commanded Duty.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="003153_0031_0FF0813712A4C808"/>YOUR SAVIOUR would be glad to see you thus remembring of Him, <HI>in the Days of your Youth.</HI> He is desirous of espousing you to Himself, that you may be married to Him, and obtain all the Blessings of a sure and well-ordered Covenant. He is freely willing to bestow them all upon you, and delights to see you coming humbly to His Table, with earnest and en∣larged Desires, after spiritual and eternal Blessings.</P>
<P>WHEREFORE beg, that you may be brought to hunger and thirst after these Blessings, and that you may be prepared by his Spirit and Grace, for the ob∣taining of them in the Ways of His Appointment.</P>
<P>MY next Advice to you, shall be,</P>
<P><HI>TO get and keep a good Conscience.</HI> Seek earnest∣ly to have your Consciences sprinkled with the Blood of CHRIST, that you may enjoy Peace of Conscience. This will be a continual Feast to you. And always endeavour to preserve and keep a tender Conscience. Beware of defiling and wounding your Consciences, by contracting any new Guilt. Be always concern'd that your Hearts may not reproach you for comply∣ing with any evil Sollicitations. Endeavour what in you lies, <HI>to keep a Conscience void of Offence, both to∣wards GOD, and towards Man.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I hasten to say, in the next Place,</P>
<P><HI>GRIEVE not the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD, but cherish his holy Motions upon your Hearts, from one time to another.</HI> The SPIRIT of GOD is doubtless often striving with you, exciting good Motions in your Minds, under the Word and Providences of GOD; see to it that you constantly cherish them. Do not
<PB N="56" REF="003153_0032_0FF08138A69F38E8"/>
by any sinful Temper or Carriage, provoke the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD to withdraw from you. GOD has said, His SPIRIT <HI>shall not always strive with Man.</HI> Men may by their unwary foolish Carriages, forfeit the gracious Influences of the SPIRIT of GOD, upon which he may depart from them.</P>
<P>AND how sad will your Case be, if you should provoke the HOLY SPIRIT of GOD to forsake you! You would then live, only to fill up the <HI>measure of your Iniquities, and to treasure up to your selves Wrath against the Day of Wrath, and the Revelation of the righteous Judgment of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>OH then see to it, That you do <HI>not quench the SPIRIT!</HI> Carefully observe all his inward and se∣cret Motions, under Ordinances, and under Provi∣dences, with an earnest Concern, your Convictions may issue in your saving and thorough Conversion to GOD.</P>
<P>I come now to the last Word to be spoken to you, at this time, and that is,</P>
<P><HI>TO prepare for Death, and the eternal World.</HI> Do not any of you <HI>boast of a to morrow, for you know not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> How many of your Age are gone down to the Grave, and gone to their long and eternal Home? And how soon it shall be thus said of you, you don't know. Oh meditate on your Frailty and Mortality every Day you live! And often in your Thoughts, put your selves into the Circumstances of one a dying, and consider, <HI>What have I left undone, which I should wish to have done at such a time, or, what have I done, that will be grievous, and bitter to me then?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="003153_0032_0FF08138A69F38E8"/>OH go away, and immediately bewail it with Grief of Heart, and resolve by the Help of GOD, you will abandon every evil way, that you will be now <HI>working out your Salvation with Fear and Trem∣bling,</HI> that you will strive more <HI>to enter in at the strait Gate,</HI> and even <HI>take the Kingdom of Heaven by a holy Violence.</HI></P>
<P>BE restless until you have got into a State of Safe∣ty for Eternity: <HI>Give noe Sleep to your Eyes, nor Slumber to your Eye-lids,</HI> until you have humbly and earnestly sought the Favour of GOD, in pardoning, renewing and sanctifying of you, and taking Possessi∣on of you for himself, that He would rule and reign in your hearts, that His Divine and Holy Image may be wrought into all the Powers of your Souls.</P>
<P>AND know for your Encouragement, That your SAVIOUR is now again, standing at the Doors of your Souls, and knocking for Entrance, willing to come in, and sup with you, and you with Him. And will you, can you now, make him wait again, until <HI>His Head be wet with the Dew and his Locks with the drops of the Night,</HI> and after all refuse to let Him in? Oh be no longer so ungrateful to CHRIST, and un∣kind to your selves! Bewail it immediately, that you have so long shut the Doors of your Souls against a compassionate SAVIOUR. And now, <HI>Lift up your Heads, O ye Gates, and be ye lift up ye everlasting Doors, that the King of Glory may come in. Kiss the Son of GOD,</HI> with a Kiss of Homage and Subjection, <HI>lest He be angry, and you perish from the Way.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Oh that you would <HI>hear his Voice to Day,</HI> and be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and doing in the great Concerns of your Souls and Eternity. Set down and count the Cost. Consider seriously, what you must part withal, and what you
<PB N="58" REF="003153_0033_0FF0813FA7E89550"/>
must comply with, to secure the Favour of GOD, and how miserable your Condition must be, if you should die in your Sins, and the awful Hazards you run of so dying, while you continue alienated from the Life of GOD, and Strangers to any renewing saving Work of GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT upon your Hearts. Oh dread to continue one Week or Day longer, in a State in which if the Summons of Death should be serv'd upon you, it would be better for you, that you had never been born.</P>
<P>I shall now draw to a Close, with a Repetition of the several Heads of Advice, that have been par∣ticularly spoken to, and insisted upon, in this and the two former Discourses, with a few close and pungent Thoughts upon them.</P>
<P>WHEN I first spake to you, I call'd on, and ad∣vis'd you, to use your selves to <HI>serious Consideration.</HI> How inexcusable must you be then, if you continue as Thoughtless and Careless as ever, about the great Concerns of your Souls and Eternity? I would fain hope, you are some of you, become more thought∣ful and concern'd about the Worth of your Souls, and the Weight of Eternity and the Awfulness of the everlasting State you stand upon the Brink of.</P>
<P>YOU have been also advis'd and exhorted to be <HI>s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> minded.</HI> To <HI>live soberly in the World.</HI> But if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> are still in any Instances, contradicting such a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from Heaven to you, by an intemperate, soon and vain Course of living, How will you answer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to GOD, and how will your Consciences 'ere long <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>raid you, [especially some of you] that you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>uld by such a religious Combination, pretend <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="59" REF="003153_0033_0FF0813FA7E89550"/>
be more serious, and sober-minded than others, and yet walk on in the Vanity of your Minds still?</P>
<P>YOU have been also exhorted to watch and pray more, <HI>that you enter not into Temptation.</HI> And if you are as heedless and unguarded as ever, and are run∣ning into the Way of Temptation still, if you are still casting off Fear, <HI>and restraining Prayer before GOD,</HI> how inexcusable must you be? Oh that your Hearts and Consciences might not condemn you for turning a deaf Ear to any of these solemn Counsels!</P>
<P>AND will you from this Day regard those more, which have at this time been given to you? Will you henceforward realize the Eye of GOD upon you, firmly believe His <HI>Omniscience,</HI> and that you shall be quickly call'd to an account, and receive according to what you have done?</P>
<P>WILL you not now beware of all kinds of <HI>Pro∣faness,</HI> and ever manifest an holy Awe, and Reverence towards GOD's holy Name?</P>
<P>AND will you always exercise a due Sollicitude a∣bout sanctifying the <HI>holy Sabbaths</HI> of the LORD? Re∣ligion will thrive and flourish, or dwindle and de∣cay according, as we observe or neglect our Duty, as to the Sanctification of the LORD'S-<HI>Day.</HI></P>
<P>ENDEAVOUR then, that your whole Carriage and Behaviour in the House of GOD, and all the Day long, be exemplary and praise-worthy; so will GOD be glorify'd, and your own Souls have Peace and Comfort.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="003153_0034_0FF08142D8CD80A8"/>YOU will always take Care to pay a due Defer∣ence and Regard, to your Superiours in Church and State, and always <HI>obey your Parents in the LORD,</HI> and never provoke or displease them by any undutiful or unbecoming Carriages; You may well look for an untimely Death if you should. See <HI>Prov.</HI> 30.17.</P>
<P>YOU must ever avoid the Company of the Wic∣ked and Profane, you will be more inexcusable now, than ever, if you should now go into, and chuse the Company of such. You will soon find it dreadfully alienate your Hearts from GOD, and increase and strengthen your Aversion to the Ways of serious Piety. Chuse the wise and godly for your beloved Companions, by whose Company and Conversation, you may probably grow wiser and better.</P>
<P>AND now in your younger Years, <HI>Ask the Way to Zion,</HI> especially when under any Concern of Spirit, repair to those appointed therefor to direct and lead you under all your Difficulties and Discouragements, as firmly believing, it is a Way appointed by GOD, for your Help, in the Way to a better World.</P>
<P>BE consciencious and constant in attending the <HI>publick Worship</HI> of GOD, when you have Health and Ability for it: Your Neglect of it, will be grievous to you, one time or other.</P>
<P>BE concerned to <HI>renew your baptismal Covenant.</HI> You can't but think it most just and reasonable, you should do it, and that you are very Lame in your Profession, until you have.</P>
<P>BE preparing also, for a due Approach to CHRIST at His <HI>Table.</HI> Though it is done, as the LORD com∣manded,
<PB N="61" REF="003153_0034_0FF08142D8CD80A8" MS="y"/>
<HI>there is still room,</HI> and He sends me <HI>this Evening,</HI> to invite you to come in, <HI>that His House may be filled.</HI> Oh be restless until you find in you, the Qualifications requisite to your worthy Participa∣tion thereof.</P>
<P>LABOUR to get, and then to keep a <HI>good Consci∣ence,</HI> that you may have Peace in your own Minds, under all Occurrences of Divine Providence.</P>
<P>AND always, be afraid of <HI>grieving</HI> the good SPIRIT of GOD, that He may never be provoked to depart from you, for Wo will be unto you, if He should!</P>
<P>FINALLY,</P>
<P><HI>PREPARE for Death, and the Eternity before you.</HI> And do <HI>the Works of Him, that has sent you, while it is Day, because the Night of Death is coming upon you, in which you cannot work.</HI> How often have you had this Exhortation, and are you slothful and like to be so, in the Business of Religion, still? How loth am I to think, you should any of you be of this un∣happy Number! For then, I must say concerning you, <HI>I have run in vain, and laboured in vain.</HI> But the LORD, in Mercy grant, it may not be so!</P>
<P>AND thus, I have finished the first general Head under the Doctrine, <HI>viz. What Things may be proper to be spoken to young People?</HI></P>
<P>THAT which yet remains to be consider'd is this, <HI>That the Ministers of CHRIST should be speedy and earnest in speaking such Things unto them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="003153_0035_0FF08144B68AC8A8"/>BUT the Consideration of this, must be re∣served to another Opportunity, if GOD shall give it.</P>
<P>LET in all now, look up to GOD, for His Blessing, on what we have heard at this time.</P>

<P>— RUN, Speak to this Young Man.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I Shall now once more, by the Help of GOD, speak to you from this</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCTRINE.</HEAD>
<ARGUMENT>
<P>THAT there are many things to be spoken to Young People, which the Ministers of CHRIST should be speedy and earnest in the speaking of unto them.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><PB N="64" REF="003153_0036_0FF0814686762108"/>UNDER this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> I have particularly shewn,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>WHAT Things may be proper to be spoken to Young People.</HI></P>
<P>I am now to shew,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>THAT the Ministers of CHRIST should be speedy and earnest in speaking such Things unto them.</HI></P>
<P>FOR the Proof and <HI>Confirmation</HI> of this, we may consider several Particulars.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE</HI> SPIRIT <HI>of GOD may be now striving with such, and therefore the Ministers of CHRIST should be speedy and earnest in the speaking these things unto them.</HI></P>
<P>THE HOLY SPIRIT of GOD is frequently striving with, and moving on the Hearts of such. Such is the <HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Long-suffering</HI> of GOD, that He bears with them, though they have too much <HI>despised the Riches of His Goodness.</HI> He waits to be gracious, and is therefore by the Suggestions of His HOLY SPIRIT, evidently intimating to such, there is <HI>Hope</HI> concerning them; that <HI>it is now an accepted Time, and a Day of Salvation;</HI> that there <HI>is Mercy with GOD, and For∣giveness</HI> for them, that if they will be now <HI>working out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling, the LORD will work in them, both to will and to do, of his own good Pleasure.</HI></P>
<P>THE SPIRIT of GOD so sets home the preached Word, that they are sometimes prick'd to the Heart by it, and convinc'd of <HI>Sin, of Righteousness, and of
<PB N="65" REF="003153_0036_0FF0814686762108"/>
Judgment to come.</HI> They have a mighty Concern a∣wakned in them, about what they shall do, that they may be saved. Their great Inquiry now is, <HI>LORD, What wilt thou have me to do?</HI> And, <HI>What shall I do, that I may inherit eternal Life?</HI></P>
<P>THEY now see themselves in continual Danger of the amazing Wrath of GOD overtaking them, while in an unconverted Estate, and are more concerned, than ever they were, to make their Escape from it, and are now with greater Concern, than ever, wait∣ing on GOD, in the use of the Means appointed for their <HI>Conversion.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, this is a special and <HI>peculiar Season,</HI> for the <HI>Ministers</HI> of CHRIST to improve, in treating with such, and if they are now earnestly intreating, perswading and exhorting of them, to <HI>strive NOW to enter in at the strait Gate,</HI> to <HI>seek first the Kingdom of GOD;</HI> Now, the Gospel of the Kingdom is preach∣ed, to press into it, to mind this <HI>one thing needful</HI> in the first Place, and before every thing else, to make Religion and the Care of their Souls Salvation their principal Business and Concern, and subordinate eve∣ry thing else to it; and therefore immediately <HI>seek the LORD, while He may be found, and call upon Him white He is near,</HI> and resolve <HI>not to let Him go, until He bless them,</HI> until they shall <HI>receive the Blessing from the LORD, and Righteousness from the GOD of their Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>IF they are now thus speaking to them, there will be great Hope, concerning their being wrought upon, the Consideration whereof, may well excite the <HI>Mi∣nisters of CHRIST</HI> to be speedy and earnest in speak∣ing to such, as hoping, that while they are so speak∣ing,
<PB N="66" REF="003153_0037_0FF08149D78E5988"/>
that may be the happy Season, in which the SPIRIT of GOD may be at work upon their Hearts, and so they will be the more likely to hear, and receive Instruction, and be made wise, even wise unto Sal∣vation.</P>
<P>AND if our speaking may be accompany'd with the gracious Influences of the SPIRIT of GOD, so that any may be thereby brought savingly Home to GOD, how speedy and earnest should we be, upon the Prospect of such happy Fruits of our Labours, for the Salvation of the precious Souls of such? The Prospect and Hope of it, may well animate us to do our utmost for their <HI>Conversion.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>YOUR speedy return to GOD will be pleasing to Him, and most for His Glory, and for your Comfort, and the Good of others.</HI></P>
<P>THE great Design of all that is spoken to you, from one time to another, in the Name of the LORD, is to bring you to <HI>return to the LORD, from whom you have fallen by your Iniquities.</HI></P>
<P>GOD sends His Ministers to intreat and beseech you to lay down your Arms of Rebellion, and make your Peace with Him. And if you will <HI>this Evening,</HI> hearken to His gracious Calls and Invitations, He will take Pleasure in you. It will be very pleasing and acceptable to Him, if you are early seeking, and serving, and devoting your selves to Him. GOD desires the first ripe Fruits, and it is meet He should be first acknowledged. And surely He infinitely deserves it.</P>
<P><PB N="67" REF="003153_0037_0FF08149D78E5988"/>AND if you hearken to the Voice of GOD now, in your Youthful Days, this will conduce most to the Glory of GOD, and the Good of others. GOD is most glorify'd by your early seeking of Him, by your early Obedience to His <HI>Voice.</HI> Such <HI>shall be like a Tree planted by the Rivers of Water, that bringeth forth his Fruit in his Season;</HI> such are like to do some good, in the World, whose Youth is sanctify'd by <HI>early Piety.</HI> — And 'tis certain you will do Duty more easily and comfortably now, than hereafter, because of fewer Hindrances, than there will be in time to come, for the longer you live, and the further you go into the World, the more difficult you will certainly find it to repent and turn to the LORD. And if you will now do it, if the LORD may now hear <HI>you bemoaning your selves, and repenting in Dust and Ashes, His Bowels will yern towards you, and He will surely have Mercy on you.</HI></P>
<P>AND if you are thus in your early Days, obedi∣ent to the Voice of GOD, it will be greatly encou∣raging to others, to induce and excite them to be obedient to the Voice of GOD too: And so you may be instrumental of promoting the good of others.</P>
<P>AND if you are religious betimes, It will certain∣ly tend to your own Comfort, to fill you with Joy and Peace, a holy Security and Serenity of Mind, that will be inexpressibly refreshing to you. And now may not the Consideration of these Things well excite and animate CHRIST'S Ministers, to be speedy and earnest in delivering the Messages of the LORD, unto Young People, since a Compliance with them, will have such a happy Tendency, in one Re∣gard, and another.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="003153_0038_0FF0814B65295DE0"/>SUCH Considerations are duly weigh'd by CHRIST'S Ministers, and do powerfully excite and stir them up, faithfully to declare the Counsel of the LORD unto such, and if possible, perswade and prevail with them, to enga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the Ways of Religion: And that Motive more especially excites their Diligence, and Earnestness in delivering the LORD'S Messages, That GOD is, and will be glorify'd, by them, if they will be obedient to them; and this is what their Hearts are exceedingly set upon, and if they may be any Ways instrumental of promoting the Glory of their GOD and SAVIOUR in the World, they have all they can desire; — this will be an inexpressible Satisfac∣tion to them; and in Hopes of being thus refresh'd, they will be speedy and earnest in doing all they pos∣sibly can, to bring such savingly Home to GOD.</P>
<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>YOU or WE may speedily die, and then we can no more speak to you in the Name of the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>YOU may speedily die, your Youth and Strength: will in no wise secure you from the Arrests of Death. Though you enjoy a confirmed Health now, and are in your <HI>full Strength,</HI> you may speedily go to your long and eternal Home, and have your State for Eter∣nity unalterably determin'd.</P>
<P>YOU may in a very few Weeks or Days, be hid in the Grave, <HI>where there is no Wisdom, Knowledge, nor Device.</HI> Assoon as ever you have given up the Ghost, there is an End of all Means and Pains as to you. <HI>The Dead praise not the LORD, nor can such as go down to Silence</HI> seek his Mercy; the Conside∣ration whereof is no little Excitement to those, who
<PB N="69" REF="003153_0038_0FF0814B65295DE0"/>
are sent to intreat Sinners to be reconciled to GOD, to be speedy, and earnest in delivering their Messages to them.</P>
<P>THEY consider, they are frail and dying Men and Children, they have to deal withal, that they are posting along into the eternal World, that they are very quickly, and they know not how speedily, to be cited before the <HI>Tribunal of GOD, and give an Ac∣count of the Deeds done in the Body,</HI> and receive their Doom, <HI>according to what they have done;</HI> and how dreadful their Doom will be, if they should be sudden∣ly surpriz'd into Eternity, while they are going on in an unconverted Estate: and therefore they improve all convenient Opportunities to advise, and counsel, to admonish and warn all such to mind the <HI>Things of their Peace, before they shall be hid from their Eyes,</HI> and to <HI>work while the Day lasts, before the Night comes in which they cannot work,</HI> and therefore <HI>to hear the Voice of GOD to Day, and no longer harden their Hearts,</HI> that they would immediately <HI>think upon their Ways, and turn their Feet to the Testimonies of GOD,</HI> that they would <HI>make haste, and delay not to keep the Commandments of GOD;</HI> that they would <HI>not quench, or grieve the SPIRIT of GOD,</HI> once more; that they would immediately comply with his blessed Motions, <HI>to confess and forsake their Sins,</HI> and give up themselves to GOD, and become serious, and sober-minded, and wise for their Souls and Eternity, while the <HI>LORD is waiting to be gracious.</HI></P>
<P>AND they may be the more speedy and earnest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n thus dealing with them, as not knowing, how soon they may die <HI>themselves.</HI> They realize their own Frailty and Mortality, that they are as liable to re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ive the Sentence of Death as any of their Hearers,
<PB N="70" REF="003153_0039_0FF081514F11FC88"/>
of whatever Age. And that it infinitely concerns them to <HI>declare the whole Counsel of GOD;</HI> and know∣ing their time may be short, their Opportunities but very few, they are therefore the more earnest∣ly sollicitous to call upon Persons of all Ages and es∣pecially those of the <HI>Rising Generation,</HI> to know, and love and serve the GOD of their Fathers, that they may be able to reflect with Comfort on their Endea∣vours for the Conversion and eternal Salvation of such, if they should be quickly brought, as they know not, but they may, into the <HI>Valley of the Shadow of Death;</HI> when we shall be able no more to speak to you in the Name of the LORD.</P>
<P>WE who speak to you now, may have our Mouths speedily shut for ever, so as never to give one Call, or Warning more.</P>
<P>AND we know not, but the next, we shall give, if done with an earnest Sollicitude for your Convic∣tion and Conversion, may by the Blessing of GOD, attain the desired End.</P>
<P><HI>WHEREFORE</HI> we should not <HI>be negligent to put you always in Remembrance of these Things, though ye know them; Yea,</HI> we <HI>think it meet as long as</HI> we <HI>are in this Tabernacle, to stir you up, by putting you in Remembrance, knowing that shortly we must put off this</HI> our <HI>Tabernacle.</HI> 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1. 12, 13, 14.</P>
<P>BUT if the GOD of our Lives, should by His gracious <HI>Visitation, preserve our Spirits,</HI> and continue our Opportunities for speaking, <HI>you</HI> may, perhaps, be of the Number, who are to be taken quickly out of His Vineyard, a Period shall be speedily put to
<PB N="71" REF="003153_0039_0FF081514F11FC88"/>
the Day of His Patience, and your Day of Grace; How can we then do otherwise than speedily, and earnestly call upon you, to be up and doing, in the great Concerns of your Souls, and the eternal World into which you are hastning daily?</P>
<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>YOUR Souls may perish for our neglecting to speak such Things unto you, and the Guilt of Blood will ly' upon Us.</HI></P>
<P>IF we do not plainly, and faithfully counsel and warn you; if instead hereof, <HI>smooth things</HI> are preach'd to you, and you are suffer'd to go on in the Way<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that seem right in your own Eyes, and you meet with little or no Check or Controul: If we do not set the <HI>Terrors of the LORD,</HI> and His Wrath before you, and let you hear but little or no∣thing of a <HI>Damnation that slumbers not;</HI> if we are loth to take any Pains to rouse you out of your car∣nal, secure State, and give you those Counsels and Directions, by a Compliance with which, you may escape the Wrath to come: If we have sufficient Rea∣son to conclude, you are going on in any sinful Cour∣ses, to the Dishonour of GOD, and the wounding of your Souls, and that will certainly prove fatal to you, if not reform'd; if through Fear, Favour or Affecti∣on, we spare you, and are loth to charge home upon your Consciences, the Guilt lying upon you, and what will be the certain and dreadful Issue of your persisting in such Ways; You may, it may b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be well pleas'd with us for it, and glad you meet with no more from us to disturb and gall you.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="003153_0040_0FF08154286AD8F8"/>BUT alas! If we should thus contrived to gratify you, your Souls would be infinitely endanger'd by it; you would more readily and easily close with every alluring Sollicitation of the Devil; Habits of Sin would be strengthen'd, and you would grow so ac∣customed to do evil, that it would become difficult, and next to impossible, for you ever to learn to do well: Yea by our Unfaithfulness and Negligence, as to advising and warning of you, you may be hard∣ned in your Security, yea, and may be suddenly and surprizingly destroyed and that without Remedy: and we shall dreadfully hazard the Salvation of our own Souls, and your Blood may be required at our Hands. For the Confirmation of this, let me turn you to that awful Text of Scripture, in <HI>Ezek.</HI> 3.17, 18. <HI>Son of Man, I have made thee a Watchman unto the House or Israel, therefore hear the Word at my Mouth, and give them warning from me. When I say unto the Wicked, Thou shalt surely die, and thou givest them not Warning, nor speakest to warn the Wicked from his wicked Way, to save his Life; the same wic∣ked Man shall die in his Iniquity, but his Blood will I require at thine Hands.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT a fearful Account shall we have to give to GOD then, if we are not speedy and earnest in de∣livering the Messages of the LORD unto you? If we don't as plainly and faithfully as we can, <HI>declare the whole Counsel of GOD unto you,</HI> you plainly see, we cannot keep our selves clear from <HI>your Blood.</HI></P>
<P>AND how awfully tremendous will it be, if Occa∣sion should be given to any of you, hereafter to say; I am, I must acknowledge, justly condemn'd to that Misery and Torment I feel, GOD and His Throne is clear and guiltless; But I might have escaped these
<PB N="73" REF="003153_0040_0FF08154286AD8F8"/>
Torments, I now, and must for ever feel; If I had been faithfully warned of my Danger: I had little or no Warning either from my <HI>Parents</HI> or <HI>Minister,</HI> of the Danger of coming into such a Place of Tor∣ment; I was never plainly and faithfully told of the Way by which I might escape this Wrath, nor were there proper Motives and Arguments used with me to work upon my <HI>Hopes,</HI> or upon my <HI>Fears,</HI> I was not earnestly warned to forsake the Ways of Sin, I addicted my self to.</P>
<P>I seldom heard, that it would be such <HI>a fearful Thing to fall into the Hands of the living GOD,</HI> or such Destruction from GOD would have been more of a Terror to me. Oh that I had heard more of the exquisite Torments of the Damned! Oh that I had been more earnestly perswaded, to fly from this Wrath! Oh that I had had the Way to avoid It more inculcated upon me, and more Means used, and Pains taken with me! My Soul is lost, 'tis lost and undone for ever, because I was not faithfully dealt with by those, who were sent of GOD, to counsel and warn me.</P>
<P>MY Damnation is very much owing to the Neg∣ligence and Unfaithfulness of those to whom the Care of my precious Soul was committed: Oh that you had been more earnest with me! You knew the Devil was doing all he could to ruin me, you saw me going on in the Paths of <HI>the Destroyer,</HI> and go∣ing down to these <HI>Chambers of Death.</HI> Oh that you had done more to have pluck'd me, as a Brand of the burning! Oh that you had warned me, a∣gain and again, and not suffer'd me to go on so quietly, and told me more of these Snares, Fire, and Brimstone, and this horrible Tempest, GOD is rain∣ing
<PB N="74" REF="003153_0041_0FF081580A219508"/>
upon me! Oh that I had heard more of the direful Impressions of the Wrath of GOD, tormenting guilty Souls here! Alas! that you would speak no more, no oftner of my Sin and Danger, and be so little concerned, that I might <HI>not come to this dread∣ful Place!</HI></P>
<P>AND now, may we not well dread to give any of you the sad Occasion of exclaiming thus against us? But verily we shall do it, if we do not with the greatest Concern and Sollicitude, treat with you about the Concerns of your precious and immor∣tal Souls, if we do not shew to you the Way of Sal∣vation, and beseech you to walk therein, and warn you faithfully of every Path of the Destroyer, and set the Terrors of the LORD and his Wrath before you, and use all the Motives and Arguments we can think of, to excite your Hopes, and awaken your Fears.</P>
<P>AND, judge you now, whether we should not be speedy and earnest in speaking such Things as we have unto you.</P>
<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>WE may hereby help forward your Conversion and Salvation, and if we should run and labour in vain, we shall keep our selves clear of your Blood.</HI></P>
<P>OUR thus speaking to you in the Name of the LORD, the Things which belong to your everlasting Peace, is the Way appointed by GOD, for your Con∣viction and Awakning, to bring you to a serious Sense of the lost and miserable Condition you are naturally in, and to an earnest Concern that you
<PB N="75" REF="003153_0041_0FF081580A219508"/>
may be delivered therefrom: It is the appointed Means for exciting your Hopes, and awakening your Fears, and thereby animating you to fly for Refuge to CHRIST, and so lay hold on the Hope in the Gos∣pel set <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you. You may be hereby brought to realize CHRIST'S Ability and Willingness to save you, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to open the everlasting Doors of your Souls to re∣ceive and entertain this King of Glory, so that CHRIST may come to dwell in your Hearts by Faith, and take an everlasting Possession of you for himself, and so you shall be made an Instance of the Grace of GOD now, and an everlasting Monument of Mercy hereafter.</P>
<P>AND now from the Hope of such blessed Effects, of our thus speaking to you, we may well be speedy and earnest in treating with you about the Concerns of your Souls and Eternity.</P>
<P>WE know, that many by being so spoken to, have by the gracious Influences of the SPIRIT of GOD, accompanying such Messages, been brought out of a State of Nature, into a State of Grace, have had new Hearts and Spirits given to them; they are be∣come the Sons and Children of GOD, by a gracious Adoption, and of Children of Wrath, and Heirs of Hell, are become the Children of GOD, and Heirs of an heavenly Inheritance; and many who have been the chief of Sinners, have been made the remarkable Instances of Sovereign Grace, the Consideration whereof, may well make us speedy and earnest still in our Endeavours for the Conversion of others, yet in the Gall of Bitterness and Bonds of Iniquity, that the like free and sovereign Grace may be glorify'd towards them also.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="003153_0042_0FF0815A0623BF30"/>BUT if a sovereign GOD, who may dispense His Favours as He pleases, withholds his gracious Influ∣ences, and permits Men to go on in the <HI>Ways of their Hearts, and in the Sight of their Eyes;</HI> if Sinners tho' often reproved, will not hear and receive Instruction, but continue <HI>Lovers of Pleasures more than Lovers of GOD,</HI> and so <HI>hate Instruction</HI> and <HI>despise Reproof,</HI> and will not by all that can be said or done, be perswad∣ed and prevail'd upon, to abandon their beloved Ways of Wickedness: If any should remain thus in∣corrigible under all the Means and Pains us'd and taken with them, for their Conversion to GOD, and after all die in their Sins, we shall deliver our Souls, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 3.19. <HI>Yet if thou warn the Wicked, and he turn not from his Wickedness, nor from his wicked Way, he shall die in his Iniquity, but thou hast deliver∣ed thy Soul.</HI></P>
<P>YOUR Blood will not be required of us; You shall not be able to charge us with Unfaithfulness to your Souls, in neglecting to counsel and warn you; yea, you will be ready enough to acknowledge, how the Threatnings and Warnings of GOD were often dispensed to you, and you little regarded them, and so will clear us from being at all instrumental of your Ruin.</P>
<P>THIS is another Consideration from which we may conclude we should be speedy and earnest in dealing with Sinners, about their spiritual and eternal Con∣cernments, we may be hereby greatly instrumental of their being brought savingly home to GOD; but if we should after all labour in vain, and spend our Strength for nought, we shall be unto GOD, a sweet savour of CHRIST, with respect unto such, as well as those that shall be saved. 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.15.</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="003153_0042_0FF0815A0623BF30"/>IF we have not shunn'd to declare the whole Counsel of GOD, we shall be pure from the Blood of all Men, and so shall be able to appeal to you, as the Apostle did to his Hearers, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.26, 27. <HI>Wherefore I take you to record this Day, that I am pure from the Blood of all Men, for I have not shunned to declare unto you, all the Counsel of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN,</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>IT will be an inexpressible Pleasure and Satis∣faction to us, if by our Ministry you may be brought home to GOD.</HI></P>
<P>IF the gracious Influences of the almighty SPIRIT of GOD, may accompany the Calls and Warnings, the Exhortations and Counsels, we give you; if you may be thereby prick'd to the Heart, and brought with an earnest Concern of Soul to inquire, <HI>What shall I do to be saved?</HI> And if we may be instrumental of leading you to CHRIST, <HI>as the Way, the Truth, and the Life;</HI> if GOD will bless our Endeavours for <HI>open∣ing your blind Eyes, and softning your hard Hearts,</HI> that so of unwilling, you may be made willing to lay down your Arms of Rebellion, and open the ever∣lasting Doors of your Souls, to receive and entertain the King of Glory; if you may be brought to see the lost and perishing Condition you are in, and your Need of CHRIST; if you are brought to see your selves poor and miserable, wretched, blind and naked, utterly destitute of any thing to recommend you to to GOD, and are freely and heartily willing to re∣nounce all Righteousness of your own, to go wholly out of your selves, and by Faith to lay hold on the Righteousness of CHRIST, to venture your eternal Sal∣vation on the Merits of the Obedience, Sufferings
<PB N="78" REF="003153_0043_0FF0815B9721B120"/>
and Death of CHRIST: If you may be brought to behold his admirable Beauty and Glory, and have such discoveries of it made to you, as shall draw forth your Hearts to him as one altogether lovely, and the chief among ten thousand: In short, if by the Dispensation of the Word and Ordinances of GOD, you may be brought to a sincere Subjection to the Gospel of CHRIST, as well as to an open Pro∣fession thereof; — It will greatly rejoice the Hearts of all that fear GOD, and more especially of such as have been instrumental of gaining over the Con∣sent of your Wills to be the LORD'S.</P>
<P>OH if we can but succeed in our Messages to any of the poor; sinful Children of Men, if we can but perswade them to cherish the Motions of GOD'S HOLY SPIRIT upon their Hearts, and come over on the LORD'S side; if we may be the Instruments of thus reducing them from their strayings and wandrings from GOD and their Duty, and bringing them back to JESUS CHRIST, <HI>the Shepherd and Bishop of their Souls;</HI> What a spring of Comfort and Joy will this be to us? It cannot be express'd the Pleasure and Satisfaction, such Reflections will yield unto us.</P>
<P>SHOULD we not then, from this Consideration, be speedy and earnest in <HI>speaking</HI> to such? In this way we might hope to see of the travail of CHRIST'S Soul, and of our own Souls, in the success of our Mi∣nistry, and be therewith exceedingly refresh'd.</P>
<P>AND may not the Prospect and Hope of this, well excite and animate us to the most speedy and earnest Endeavours for the Conversion of such?</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="003153_0043_0FF0815B9721B120"/>ONCE more,</P>
<P N="7">7. and lastly. <HI>THE solemn Oath and Charge of GOD, may well make us speedy and earnest in our Endeavours, for your Conversion to GOD.</HI></P>
<P>YOU are committed to our Care and Charge, by the great Shepherd of the Sheep. And we have taken the Oversight of you, and if we have any Love to CHRIST, we must testify it by feeding the <HI>Lambs</HI> of the Flock, as well as the Sheep.</P>
<P>YOU are a very peculiar Part of our Watch and Charge, and we cannot answer it to GOD, if we don't use our utmost Endeavours to bring you to <HI>remember your Creator in the Days of your Youth,</HI> to devote your Time and Talents, all you have and are to GOD, and not delay a Moment longer in the great Concerns of your Souls, as to the getting into a State of Safety for Eternity.</P>
<P>KNOWING your continual Danger, because of your wicked Hearts, a tempting Devil, and an en∣snaring World, we cannot but faithfully warn and call upon you, to forsake the Paths of the Destroyer, and get into the Way of Life, and use all the proper Motives and Arguments we can think of, to excite you to your Duty; and herein discharge our Duty to GOD, and to you, that we may not incur the Doom of unfaithful Servants, which you know we shall, if we do not our utmost, to save your Soul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from Death.</P>
<P>BUT I may not proceed any farther in the Con∣firmation of the Doctrine, and I hope what ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> been already said, may serve abundantly to confirm it
<PB N="80" REF="003153_0044_0FF0815D9ED55B38"/>

<ARGUMENT>
<P>WE should give thanks to the King and Head of His Church and People, when favour'd with faithful Am∣bassadors.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>IF we have Reason to hope and believe, that they who bring the Messages of Peace and Reconciliation to us, have at Heart the Honour and Glory of GOD, and are earnestly and sincerely endeavouring that we may be brought to a sincere Repentance, and thorough Conversion to GOD; if while they are running and speaking to us, their Messages evidently tend to pro∣mote our spiritual Benefit and Advantage, if we would but hearken to, and comply with them; we have certainly cause of Thankfulness to GOD, in appointing an Order of Men, of the same Make and Frame with our selves, thus familiarly to treat with us, yea and intreat, and beseech us to hear, that our Souls may live.</P>
<P>WERE our Teachers removed into Corners; or, were they unfaithful; were they such as would <HI>daub with untemper'd Mortar, and preach smooth Things to us,</HI> and flatter us in our evil Ways, and suffer us to go on quietly in a Course of Sin; What a tremendous Judgment of GOD would this be?</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="003153_0044_0FF0815D9ED55B38"/>OH let us be thankful then that <HI>our Eyes yet see our Teachers,</HI> and that we have the Mind and Will of GOD faithfully dispens'd unto us.

<ARGUMENT>
<P>HOW readily then should you hearken to the Messa∣ges they bring unto you?</P>

<P>IF it so highly concerns them to be speedy and ear∣nest in bringing the Messages of GOD to you, it cer∣tainly does as much concern you, to give a speedy and ready Entertainment to them; <HI>for it is for your Life.</HI> The Lives of your precious Souls depend upon your hearkening to them.

<P>HOW discouraging must it be to run in vain?</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P>WHEN we obey the Command of our LORD and Master, in bringing his Messages to you, that are of the last Concernment, and use with you all proper Motives and Arguments to work upon your Hopes and upon your Fears; and yet your Language is like theirs, in <HI>Jer.</HI> 44.16. <HI>As for the Word that thou hast spoken unto us in the Name of the Lord, we will not hearken unto thee:</HI> How discouraging must it be?

<ARGUMENT>
<P>LET me now beg of You, in the Name of Him who sends me this Evening to you, that you would do your Utmost to hear and obey the Messages, I have brought unto you, that I may not run in vain.</P>
</ARGUMENT>
<P><HI>NOW then I am an Ambassador for CHRIST, as though GOD did beseech you by me, I pray you in CHRIST'S stead, be ye reconciled unto GOD.</HI> I per∣swade my self, You question not <HI>my</HI> Authority, as an Ambassador of the LORD JESUS CHRIST: And You will, I hope, regard what I speak to you, as the Word of GOD, and not of Man. Believe it, the LORD has been speaking to You from Heaven, and He takes special Notice of your Regard to what is spoken.</P>
<P>I am perswaded, Your Consciences must witness for me, that what I have been now and before speak∣ing to you from this <HI>Text,</HI> is agreeable to the Mind and Will of GOD, and that it is of infinite Concern∣ment to you, to obey the Voice of your <HI>Teacher,</HI> and incline your Ears to the Instructions that have been given you.</P>
<P>AND I would fain hope, that I have not <HI>run,</HI> and <HI>spoke</HI> in vain, as to some of the YOUNG PEOPLE of my Charge. I have some Reason to hope, what I have said, has been awakening and quickening to some, and that they will do their utmost, I may not labour in vain as to <HI>them;</HI> that they will conti∣nue <HI>working out their Salvation with Fear and Trem∣bling, and give all Diligence to make their Calling and Election sure, that they may he found of their
<PB N="84" REF="003153_0046_0FF07D2F40663028"/>
Judge in Peace, and be set before the Presence of his Glory with exceeding Joy.</HI></P>
<P>I hope, through the infinite Grace of GOD, there will be found some such Seals of <HI>my Ministry</HI> among You, concerning whom, Oh that I may have cause to say in the Day that is approaching, <HI>Here am I LORD, and the Children which were begotten to Thee, by my Ministry!</HI> Then will <HI>You be my Joy and Crown of Rejoicing in the Day of the LORD!</HI></P>
<P>BUT I must have done <HI>speaking</HI> to you, but how loth am I to leave speaking, until I have perswaded and prevail'd with You to become the <HI>Children</HI> of GOD; How fain would I gain the Consent of your Souls to be the LORD'S, to hear and obey His Voice, before I have done <HI>speaking</HI> to you?</P>
<P>GOD is my Witness, whom I would serve with <HI>my Spirit in the Gospel of His Son,</HI> that my Hearts de∣sire and Prayer for you is, that You may be saved.</P>
<P>I trust I can say concerning You, as the Apostle did of his <HI>Philippians; Chap.</HI> 1.7, 8. <HI>I have you in my Heart, for GOD is my Record, how greatly I long after, you all, in the Bowels of JESUS CHRIST. And this I pray, that your Love may abound yet more and more, in Knowledge, and in all Judgment. That ye may approve the Things that are excellent, that ye may be sincere and without Offence till the Day of CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P>THUS are we praying, and will continue to pray for you, and the more earnestly as to such of you, concerning whom we may have too much Cause to fear, and say as the Apostle speaks, concerning some of his Hearers, <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.11. <HI>I am afraid of you,
<PB N="85" REF="003153_0046_0FF07D2F40663028"/>
left I have bestowed on you labour in vain.</HI> Will you be surpriz'd, if I tell you, I look for no other, but to have this heavy Trial still, with respect to some of you, That I have <HI>run and spoken in vain!</HI></P>
<P>BUT I hope you will do more than you have done, that there may be no Cause for such a Com∣plains; that you will now immediately resolve, that by the Grace of GOD helping of you, you will seek and cry more for an hearing Ear and an understand∣ing Heart, that you may so hear what is spoken from one time to another, as that your Souls may live. If you will not be perswaded to do this, I have hitherto <HI>spoken</HI> in vain.</P>
<P>I will now put over all I have said and done, into the Hands of the Almighty SPIRIT of Grace, the Wind that bloweth where it listeth.</P>
<P><HI>OH almighty SPIRIT of Grace, do Thou come down, and breathe upon our Children and Young People. By thine inward efficacious Influences, make the Calls that have been given to them effectual, and thy free and sovereign Grace shall have the Praise of it. AMEN.</HI></P>
