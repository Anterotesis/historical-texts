<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IT seems to be a kind of duty incumbent on those who devote themselves to Poetry, to raise, if pos∣sible, the dignity of a declining Art, by making it as beneficial to Life and Manners as the limits of Com∣position, and the character of modern Times will allow: The ages, indeed, are past, in which the song of the Poet was idolized for its MIRACULOUS EFFECTS; yet a Poem, intended to promote the cultivation of good-humour, may still, perhaps, be fortunate enough to prove of some little service to society in general; or, if this idea may be thought too chimerical and ro∣mantic by sober Reason, it is at least one of those pleasing and innocent delusions, in which a political Enthusiast may be safely indulged.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="020410_0003_0FAF08FBF3502B60"/>THE following production owes its existence to an incident in real life, very similar to the principal ac∣tion of the last Canto; but in forming the general plan of the work, it seemed to me absolutely neces∣sary to introduce both the agency and the abode of SPLEEN, notwithstanding the difficulty and the ha∣zard of attempting a subject so happily executed by the masterly pencil of Pope. I considered his Cave of Spleen as a most exquisite cabinet picture; and, to avoid the servility of imitation, I determined to sketch the mansion of this gloomy Power on a much wider canvass: Happy, indeed, if the judgment of the public may enable me to exclaim, with the honest vanity of the Painter, who compared his own works to the divine productions of Raphael,
<Q>E son Pittore anch' Io!</Q></P>
<P>THE celebrated Alessandro Tassoni, who is gene∣rally considered as the inventor of the modern Heroi∣comic Poetry, was so proud of having extended the limits of his art by a new kind of composition, that he not only spoke of it with infinite exultation in one of his private letters, but even gave a MS copy of his work to his native city of Modena, with an inscrip∣tion, in which he styled it a new species of Poetry, invented by himself.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="020410_0004_0FAF08FE42A523A8"/>A FEW partial friends have asserted, that the present performance has some degree of similar merit; but as I apprehend all the novelty it possesses, may rather re∣quire an apology, than entitle its Author to challenge commendation, I shall explain how far the conduct of the Poem differs from the most approved models in this mode of writing, and slightly mention the poeti∣cal effects, which such a variation appeared likely to produce.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that the favorite Poems, which blend the serious and the comic, represent their prin∣cipal characters in a satirical point of view: It was the intention of Tassoni (though prudence made him attempt to conceal it) to satirize a particular Italian Nobleman, who happened to be the object of his re∣sentment. Boileau openly ridicules the French Eccle∣siastics in his Lutrin; Garth, our English Physicians, in his Dispensary; and the Rape of the Lock itself, that most excellent and enchanting Poem, which I ne∣ver contemplate but with new idolatry, is denomi∣nated THE BEST SATIRE EXTANT, by the learned Dr. Warton, in his very elegant and ingenious, but severe Essay on Pope: A sentence which seems to be confirmed by the Poet himself, in his letter to Mrs. Fermor, where he says, <Q>The character of Belinda,
<PB N="vi" REF="020410_0005_0FAF08FF49D5FD78"/>
as it is now managed, resembles you in nothing but beauty.</Q> Though I think, that no composition can surpass, or perhaps ever equal this most happy effort of Genius, as a sportive Satire, I imagined it might be possible to give a new Character to this mixed species of Poetry, and to render it by its Object, though not in its Execution, more noble than the most beautiful and refined Satire can be. We have seen it carried to inimitable perfection, in the most delicate raillery on Female Foibles:—It remained to be tried, if it might not also aspire to delineate the more engaging features of Female Excellence. The idea appeared to me worth the experiment; for, if it succeeded, it seemed to promise a double advantage; first, it would give an air of novelty to the Poem; and, secondly, what I thought of much greater importance, it would render it more interesting to the heart. On these principles, I have endeavored to paint SERENA as a most lovely, engaging, and accomplished character; yet I hope the colouring is so faithfully copied from GENERAL NATURE, that, every man, who reads the Poem, may be happy enough to know many Fair ones, who resemble my Heroine.</P>
<P>THERE is another point, in which I have also at∣tempted to give this Poem an air of novelty: I mean, the manner of connecting the real and the visionary
<PB N="vii" REF="020410_0006_0FAF08FFAFDBB580"/>
scenes, which compose it; by shifting these in alter∣nate Cantos, I hoped to make familiar Incident and allegorical Picture afford a strong relief to each other, and keep the attention of the Reader alive, by an ap∣pearance particularly diversified. I wished, indeed (but I fear most ineffectually) for powers to unite some touches of the sportive wildness of Ariosto, and the more serious sublime painting of Dante, with some portion of the enchanting elegance, the refined imagi∣nation, and the moral graces of Pope; and to do this, if possible, without violating those rules of propriety, which Mr. Cambridge has illustrated, by example as well as precept, in the Scribleriad, and in his sensible Preface to that elegant and learned Poem.</P>
<P>I HAVE now very frankly informed my Reader of the EXTENT, or rather of the EXTRAVAGANCE of my desire; for I will not give it the name of DESIGN:— They, whom an enlightened taste has rendered tho∣roughly sensible how very difficult it must be to ac∣complish such an idea, will not only be the first to discern, but the most ready to pardon those errors, in∣to which so hazardous an attempt may perhaps have betrayed me. I had thoughts of introducing this per∣formance to the Public, by a Dissertation of considera∣ble length on this species of Poetry; but I forbear to indulge myself any farther in such preliminary remarks,
<PB N="viii" REF="020410_0007_0FAF09007A795088"/>
as the anxiety of authors is so apt to produce, from the reflection, that, however ingeniously written, they add little or nothing to the success of a good Poem and are utterly insufficient to prevent that neglect, or oblivion, which is the inevitable fate of a bad one.</P>
<P>IN dismissing a work to my Fair Readers, which is intended principally for their perusal, I shall only re∣commend it to their attention; and bid them farewell, in the words of the pleasant and courteous Tassoni—
<Q><L>Vaglia il buon voler, s'altro non lice,</L>
<L>Echi la leggera, viva felice!</L></Q></P>

<L>IN yon bright circle young SERENA grew;</L>
<L>A lovelier nymph the pencil never drew;</L>
<L>For the fond Graces form'd her easy mien,</L>
<L N="20">And Heaven's soft azure in her eye was seen.</L>
<L>She seem'd a rose-bud, when it first receives</L>
<L>The genial sun in its expanding leaves:</L>
<L>For now she enter'd those important years,</L>
<L>When the full bosom swells with hopes and fears;</L>
<L N="25">When conscious Nature prompts the secret sigh,</L>
<L>And sheds sweet langour o'er the melting eye;</L>
<L>When nobler toys the female heart trepan,</L>
<L>And Dolls rejected, yield their place to Man.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>BENEATH a Father's care SERENA grew;</L>
<L N="30">The good Sir Gilbert, to his country true,</L>
<L>A faithful Whig, who zealous for the state,</L>
<L>In Freedom's service led the loud debate;</L>
<L>Yet ev'ry day, by transmutation rare,</L>
<L>Turn'd to a Tory in his elbow chair,</L>
<L N="35">And made his daughter pay, howe'er absurd,</L>
<L>Passive obedience to his sovereign word.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>IN his domestic sway he borrow'd aid</L>
<L>From prim PENELOPE, an ancient maid,</L>
<L>His upright sister, conscious of her worth,</L>
<L N="40">Who valued still her beauty, and her birth;</L>
<L>Tho' from her birth no envied rank she gain'd,</L>
<L>And of her beauty but the ghost remain'd;</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="020410_0010_0FAF0902C0443108"/>A restless ghost! that with remembrance keen</L>
<L>Proclaim'd incessant what it once had been;</L>
<L N="45">Delighted still the steps of youth to haunt,</L>
<L>To watch the tender nymph, and warm gallant;</L>
<L>And, with an eye that petrified pursuit,</L>
<L>Hang like the dragon o'er th' Hesperian fruit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>THO' strictly guarded by this jealous power,</L>
<L N="50">The mild SERENA no restraint could sour:</L>
<L>Pure was her bosom, as the silver lake,</L>
<L>E'er rising winds the ruffled water shake,</L>
<L>When the bright pageants of the morning sky,</L>
<L>Across th' expansive mirror lightly fly,</L>
<L N="55">By vernal gales in bright succession driven,</L>
<L>While the clear glass reflects the smile of heaven.</L>
<L>In gay content a sportive life she led,</L>
<L>The child of Modesty, by Virtue bred:</L>
<L>Her light companions Innocence and Ease:</L>
<L N="60">Her hope was Pleasure, and her wish to please:</L>
<L>For this to Fashion early rights she paid:</L>
<L>For this to Venus secret vows she made:</L>
<L>Nor held it sin to cast a private glance</L>
<L>O'er the dear pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of a new romance,</L>
<L N="65">Eager in fiction's touching scenes to find</L>

<L>On all the virtues of her feeling breast.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="020410_0011_0FAF090383DE8638"/>Sweet Evilina's fascinating power</L>

<L>The Modern Anecdote was next convey'd</L>
<L>Beneath her pillow by her faithful maid.</L>
<L N="75">The nymph, attentive as the brooding dove,</L>
<L>Por'd o'er the tender scenes of Franzel's love:</L>
<L>The sinking taper now grew weak and pale;</L>
<L>SERENA sigh'd, and dropt th' unfinish'd tale;</L>
<L>But, as warm clouds in vernal aether roll,</L>
<L N="80">The soft ideas floated in her soul:</L>
<L>Free from ambitious pride, and envious care,</L>
<L>To love, and to be lov'd, was all her prayer:</L>
<L>While these fond thoughts her gentle mind possess'd,</L>
<L>Soft slumber settled on her snowy breast.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L N="85">SCARCE had her radiant eyes began to close,</L>
<L>When to her view a friendly vision rose:</L>
<L>A fairy Phantom struck her mental sight,</L>

<L>Array'd like Pallas was the pigmy form,</L>
<L N="90">When the sage Goddess stills the raging storm.</L>
<L>Her casque was amber richly grac'd above</L>
<L>With down, collected from the callow dove:</L>
<L>Her burnish'd breast-plate, of a deeper dye,</L>
<L>Was once the armour of a golden fly:</L>
<L N="95"><PB N="5" REF="020410_0012_0FAF090434595248"/>A lynx's eye her little aegis shone,</L>
<L>By fairy spells converted into stone,</L>
<L>And worn of old as elsin poets sing,</L>
<L>By Aegypt's lovely queen, a favorite ring:</L>
<L>Mysterious power was in the magic toy,</L>
<L N="100">To turn the frowns of care to smiles of joy.</L>
<L>Her tiny lance, whose radiance stream'd afar,</L>
<L>Was one bright sparkle from the bridal star.</L>
<L>A filmy mantle round her figure play'd,</L>
<L>Fine as the texture, by Arachne laid</L>
<L N="105">O'er some young plant, when glittering to the view</L>
<L>With many an orient pearl of morning dew.</L>
<L>The Phantom hover'd o'er the conscious Fair</L>
<L>With such a lively smile of tender care,</L>
<L>As on her elphin lord, Titania cast,</L>
<L N="110">When first she found his angry spell was past.</L>
<L>Round her rich locks SERENA chanc'd to tie</L>
<L>An ample ribband of caerulean dye:</L>
<L>High o'er her forehead rose the graceful brow.</L>
<L>Whose arch commanded the sweet scene below:</L>
<L N="115">The hovering Spirit view'd the tempting spot,</L>
<L>And lightly perch'd on this unbending knot;</L>
<L>As the fair flutterer of Pysche's race,</L>
<L>Is seen to terminate her airy chace,</L>
<L>When, pleas'd at length her quivering wings to close,</L>
<L N="120">Fondly she settles on the fragrant rose.</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="020410_0013_0FAF0904EF6DE050"/>Now in soft notes, more musically clear</L>
<L>Than ever Fairy breath'd to mortal ear,</L>
<L>These words the visionary voice convey'd</L>

<L N="140">Thy rising bosom swells with just desire</L>
<L>Rapture to feel, and rapture to inspire:</L>
<L>Not the vain bliss, the transitory joys,</L>
<L>That childish woman feels in radiant toys;</L>
<L>The costly Diamond or the radiant Pearl,</L>
<L N="145">The massive Nabob, or the tinsel Earl.</L>

<L N="15">For, to the warning vision fondly true,</L>
<L>Now the quick fair one to the toilet flew:</L>
<L>With keen delight her ravish'd eye survey'd</L>
<L>The mystic ribband on her mirror laid:</L>

<L>Sir GILBERT and the Nymph first meet the Peer;</L>
<L>And, while his morning compliments commence,</L>
<L N="120">The slighted breakfast stands in cold suspence.</L>
<L>But far unlike to Hector's ruder grace</L>
<L>His modern stature, and his modish face!</L>

<L N="130">As the French Boudoir to the Gothic Tower,</L>
<L>Such is the Peer, whom Fashion much admires,</L>
<L>Compar'd in person to his ancient fires:</L>

<L N="430">Recal'd the functions of her fainting soul.</L>
<L>When on the distant seat, where, fondly fixt,</L>
<L>He view'd the Nymph as in the dance she mixt,</L>
<L>He indistinctly heard, with wounded ear,</L>
<L>The spleenful outrage of the angry Peer.</L>
<L N="435">Swift at th' imperfect sound, with choler wild,</L>
<L>He sprung to succour his insulted Child;</L>
<L>But ere his fury into language broke,</L>
<L>Love calm'd the storm that Arrogance awoke.</L>
<L>The sudden burst of FALKLAND'S tender flame,</L>
<L N="440">His winning manners, his distinguish'd name,</L>
<L>His liberal soul, by Fortune's smile carest,</L>
<L>All join'd to harmonize the Father's breast.</L>
<L>His fiery thoughts subside in glad surprize,</L>
<L>And to the generous youth he warmly cries:</L>
<L N="445">"Ingenuous FALKLAND! by thy frankness won,</L>
<L>My willing heart would own thee as my Son;</L>
<L>But on thy hopes SERENA must decide:—</L>
<L>Haste we together from this house of Pride."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>SO spoke the Sire; for, to her Votary kind,</L>
<L N="450">SOPHROSYNE inspir'd his soften'd mind.</L>
<L>Speaking, he smil'd, to see that on his word</L>
<L>The Lover hung, and blest the sounds he heard;</L>
<L>That his embarrass'd Child his sentence caught;</L>
<L>With each tumultuous sign of tender thought;</L>
<L N="455"><PB N="114" REF="020410_0121_0FB087EF52AFCC58"/>Whose blushes, springing from the heart, declare</L>
<L>The dawn of fondness in the modest Fair.</L>
<L>Th' enchanted Youth with extacy convey'd</L>
<L>Forth from the troubled Feast the trembling Maid.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>AS the keen Sailor, whom his daring soul</L>
<L N="460">Has drawn, too vent'rous near the freezing pole;</L>
<L>Who, having slighted Caution's kind advice,</L>
<L>Seem'd wedg'd within impervious worlds of ice;</L>
<L>If, from each chilling form of peril free,</L>
<L>At length he reach the unincumber'd sea,</L>
<L N="463">With joy superior to his transient pain,</L>
<L>Rushes, exulting, o'er th' expansive main:</L>
<L>Such strong delight SERENA'S bosom shar'd,</L>
<L>When sweet Reflection to her heart declar'd,</L>
<L>That all the trials of her sate were past,</L>
<L N="470">And Love's decisive plaudit seal'd the last.</L>
<L>Her airy Guard prepares the softest down,</L>
<L>From Peace's wing, to line the nuptial crown:</L>
<L>Her smiles accelerate the bridal morn,</L>
<L>And clear her Votary's path from ev'ry thorn.</L>
<L N="475">On the quick match the Prude's keen censures fall,</L>
<L>Blind to the heavenly Power who guided all;</L>
<L>But mild SERENA scorn'd the prudish play,</L>
<L>To wound warm Love with frivolous delay;</L>
<L>Nature's chaste child, not Affectation's slave,</L>
<L N="480">The heart she meant to give, she frankly gave.</L>
<L>Thro' her glad Sire no gouty humours run,</L>
<L>Jocund he glories in his destin'd Son.</L>
<L><PB N="115" REF="020410_0122_0FAF0845E0A03028"/>PENELOPE herself, no longer seen</L>
<L>In the four semblance of tormenting Spleen,</L>
<L N="485">Buys for her Niece the robes of nuptial state,</L>
<L>Nor scolds the Mercer once thro' all the long debate.</L>
<L>For quick dispatch, the honest Man of law,</L>
<L>Toils half the night the legal ties to draw;</L>
<L>At length th' enraptur'd Youth, all forms compleat,</L>
<L N="490">Bears his sweet Bride to his paternal seat;</L>
<L>On a fair lawn the cheerful mansion stood,</L>
<L>And high behind it rose a circling wood.</L>
<L>As the blest Lord of this extensive reign</L>
<L>Led his sweet partner thro' her new domain,</L>
<L N="495">With fond surprize, SERENA soon descried</L>
<L>A temple rais'd to her aetherial Guide.</L>
<L>Its ornaments she view'd with tender awe,</L>
<L>Their fashion such as she in vission saw;</L>
<L>For the kind Youth, her grateful smile to gain,</L>

<L>Joyful he cried, to his angelic Wife,</L>
<L>"Be this kind Power the worship of our life!"</L>
<L>He spoke; and led her to the inmost shrine;</L>
<L>Here, link'd in rosy bands, two Votaries shine;</L>
<L N="505">The pencil had imparted life to each,</L>
<L>With energy that seem'd beyond its reach.</L>
<L>First stood Connubial-Love, a manly Youth,</L>
<L>Whose bright eye spoke the ardent vows of truth;</L>
<L>Friendship, sweet smiling, fill'd the second place,</L>
<L N="510">In all the softer charms of Virgin grace.</L>
