<HEAD>REMARKS ON <HI>Zenger</HI>'s TRYAL. Taken out of the <HI>Barbados</HI> GAZETTE'S; for the Benefit of the Students in <HI>Law,</HI> and others in <HI>North-America</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="marg"><P>N. B. These Remarks are annexed to <HI>Zenger</HI>'s Tryal published in the 9th Volume of State Tryals, and at the End of the Title, refers to the following Notes, (viz.)</P>
<Q><P>These Remarks were written by two eminent Lawyers in one of our Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> immediately after the Publication of the Trial of Mr. <HI>Zenger,</HI> which it seems had been industriously spread over that Part of the World, before it reached <HI>England!</HI></P>
<P>As the Doctrines contained in that Tryal, or rather in the Speech of Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> are of so new a Cast, and so absolutely contra∣dictory to all the Resolutions, and Judgments, that have been settled and established for so many Ages, and by Judges of the highest Reputation, and most unquestionable Characters for their Integrity, Virtues, and Abilities; it could not be imagined, so wild, and idle an Harangue, could have had any Weight, or have met with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Reception here (i. e. in <HI>England</HI>) where the Laws, relating to Libels, have been so often canvassed, and are generally so well understood; and therefore the Person, to whom these Remarks were sent, never thought of making any other Use of them, than to satisfy his own Curiosity, and that of his Friends.</P>
<P>But seeing to his great Surprise, that this extraordinary Decla∣mation, has been mentioned with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Air of Applause, and Tri∣umph, in several News-Papers, as striking out some new Lights, with Regard to the Doctrine of Libels, and upon the Credit of that Recommendation, the whole Tryal <HI>not only twice printed here,</HI> but retailed out in Scraps, in the public News-Papers; whereby many well meaning People <HI>may be deceived, and led into wrong Notions,</HI> concerning the Laws of their Country in this Point: He has thought fit to communicate these Remarks to the public, in order to remove any Mistake, or Errors, that Persons may fall into, for want of an adequate Judgment in these Matters; and the rather, because if such false Opinions, should happen to in∣fluence the Conduct of Practise of any, the Consequences may be very dangerous; it being an established Maxim in our Law, that neither Ignorance, nor Mistake, is an Excuse to any one who has broke it, from the Penalty of it</P></Q></NOTE>.

<OPENER><SALUTE>Mr. <HI>Keimer,</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T has been a common Remark among those who have observed upon the capri∣cious Dispensations of Fortune, that great Events are often produced by Instru∣ments that are not seemingly adequate; nay, that the same apparent Causes have quite contrary Effects, and the Road that leads one Man to Wealth, Honour, and Power, sometimes carries another to Poverty, Infamy, and Ruin. Hence comes that confused Distribution of Axes and Coronets, Halters and Ribbons; which History displays by nu∣merous shocking Examples, and thus it is, that Fate seems to play at Cross-Purposes with Mankind; or to speak in Scripture Phrase, in this Sense as well as many others, <HI>the Wisdom of this World is Foolishness.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="011573_0003_0F8746FB04627F60"/>I find myself drawn into these grave Reflections, Mr. <HI>Keim<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> by reading the Tryal of <HI>John Peter Zen∣ger,</HI> at <HI>New-York,</HI> upon <HI>an Information for printing and publishing a Libel.</HI> This Piece, it seems, has been lately printed there, and was put into my Hands t'other Day, by a Friend who has both a general Acquaintance and a Correspondence with the north∣ern Colonies, as a rare Production, containing many Things new and surprising. And in Truth, I must say it affords a lively Specimen, in Miniature, of the Justness of the foregoing Remarks; I mean that Part of it which is attributed to <HI>Andrew Hamilton,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>Philadelphia, Barrister at Law;</HI> together with the Sequal, describing the munificent Behaviour of the Citizens in Common Council assembled, to the learn∣ed Gentleman, for his singular Performance on that Occasion.</P>
<P>I must at the same Time assure you, that if <HI>Zenger</HI>'s Tryal had been printed by Order of the Court that tried him, or from a Copy taken by a private Hand
<PB N="5" REF="011573_0003_0F8746FB04627F60"/>
at the Tryal, or by any other Means that excluded Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Approbation or Privity, I should have enjoy'd my own Opinion, without troubling you or any Body else about it, and had the Charity to resolve all the Extravagancies that occur throughout his De∣clamation, into a right Discernment of the People he talk'd to, and a Dexterity in captivating them, which had its Effect in the Acquittal of his Client. But when a Gentleman of the Bar takes the Pains to write over a long Discourse (he being the only Lawyer of either Side who gave the Printer his Notes) in order to send it abroad through the World, as a Spe∣cimen of his Abilities, Sentiments, and Principles; as a solemn Argument in the Law, fit to see the light and abide the Test in all Places, and above all, <HI>as a Task of Duty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeng. <HI>Tryal,</HI> P. 39. 41.</NOTE> <HI>which he thought himself bound to perform, even by going to the utmost Parts of the Land</HI> for the Purpose; and all this, <HI>without Fee or Reward, under the Weight of many Years and great Infirmities of Body:</HI> When a Barrister, I say, thus becomes a Volunteer for Error, and presumes to obtrude bad Law and false Reasoning upon the Sense of Mankind, because the sage Magistrates of <HI>New-York</HI> have put their Seal to it; I think myself at Liberty, without using any other Apology, to exercise the judging Privilege of a Rea∣der, since the Gentleman himself has put me into the Possession of it.</P>
<P>In doing this, I shall not in the least gratifie a vain Itch of Writing, for there are no extraordinary Talents neces∣sary for refuting gross Absurdities; but I shall have the honest Merit of endeavouring to undeceive such of my Fellow Subjects in the Plantations as may; from the late uncommon Success of the Doctrine, mistake the Liberty of the Press for a Licence to write and publish infa∣mous Things of their Superiors, and of all others, at their Pleasure, provided they write and publish nothing but what is true. In the next Place, I would pre∣serve, as far as I am able, the Dignity of the Profes∣sion of the Law in these remote Parts of the British
<PB N="6" REF="011573_0004_0F8746FB2B12E6B8"/>
Dominions; and prevent its learned Professors in <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> who probably will see the renowned Piece above mentioned (if we may judge from the Industry used in dispersing it) from suspecting that all their <HI>American</HI> Brethren use the like Arts to gain Popularity and ho∣nourable Rewards. The former, having the Advant∣age of going daily to the great School of Law at <HI>West∣minster,</HI> are already apt enough to think meanly of the Accomplishment of the latter, who are far removed from Instruction; and their Opinion must be strongly confirmed in this Respect, if such a Rhapsody as was utter'd at <HI>New-York,</HI> should not only be applauded and rewarded publickly there, but printed and scatter'd in Reams through the other Colonies, without being followed by a suitable Animadversion.</P>
<P>Neither will it he amiss to take some Notice in this Place of the Quackery of the Profession in general, without any particular Application, as it has been practised with vast Success in some of our Colonies. You will often see (if common Fame may be trusted) a self-sufficient enterprising Lawyer, compounded of something between a Politician and a Broker, who making the Foibles of the Inhabitants his Capital Study, and withal taking Advantage of the Weak∣ness of his Judges, the Ignorance of some of his Bre∣thren, the Modesty of others, and the honest Scruples of a third Sort (without having any of his own) be∣comes insensibly an Oracle in the Courts, and acquires by Degrees a kind of Dominion over the Minds as well as the Estates of the People. An Influence never to be obtained but by the help of Qualities very diffe∣rent from Learning and Integrity. Where ever such a Man is found, the Wonder is not great, if from a long Habit of advancing what he pleases, and having it received for Law, he comes in Time to fancy, that what he pleases to advance is really Law.</P>
<P>Give me Leave, therefore, to bespeak two or three of your Papers, during this short Vacation between our Monthly Courts, that I may candidly examine this now System of <HI>Libels</HI> lately composed and propa∣gated

My Intention is to consider Things, not Persons, having no other Knowledge of the Gentleman principally concern'd than what is deriv'd from the Paper now before me; and being wholly a Stranger to the Merit of those Disputes that gave Rise to the Prosecution of this Printer.</P>
<P>Much less shall I turn Advocate for any lawless Power in Governors. God forbid I should be guilty of such a Prostitution, who know by Experience of what Stuff they are commonly made; the wrong Im∣pressions they are apt to receive of themselves and others; their Passions, Prejudices and Pursuits; tho' when all reasonable Allowances are made for certain Circumstances that attend their Mission from Home and their Situation abroad, a considerate Person may be tempted to think—it is well they are no worse than they are.</P>

<HEAD>From the <HI>Barbados</HI> Gazette, No. 439. <HI>Remarks on Zenger's Trial.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IN considering the Defence made for the Defendant (Mr. <HI>Zenger,</HI> by his Council Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>) upon <HI>not guilty</HI> pleaded to an <HI>Information for printing and publishing a Libel,</HI> it is not to the Purpose to enquire how far the Matters charged in the Information are in their Nature Libellous, nor whether the <HI>Innuendos</HI> are
<PB N="8" REF="011573_0005_0F8746FBDAFF1260"/>
properly used to apply the Matters to Persons, Things, and Places. It is only necessary to examine the Truth of this single Proposition, upon which the whole De∣fence is grounded, and to which the several Parts of it refer; namely, <HI>that the several Matters charged in the Information, are not and cannot be libellous because they are true in Fact.</HI></P>
<P>This is the Cardinal Point, upon which the learned Gentleman's whole Argument turns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeng. Tryal. P. 17, 18, 30.</NOTE> and which he lays down over and over, as the first Principle that governs the Doctrine of Libels; and accordingly he confesses the Printing and Publishing of the Papers laid in the In∣formation, and puts it upon the King's Council to prove the Facts contain'd in them to be false; alledg∣ing at the same Time, that unless that were done, the Defendant could not be guilty; but if the same were prov'd to he false,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 21. 22.</NOTE> he would own the Papers containing them to be Libels. To this, it seems, the Attorney General, answer'd, <HI>that a Negative is not to be proved;</HI> and the latter replied in these Words, which I choose to set down that I may not be thought to do him wrong.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 22.</NOTE>—<HI>I did expect to hear that a Negative cannot be proved; but every Body knows there are many Exceptions in that gene∣ral Rule: For if a Man is charged with killing another, or stealing his Neighbour's Horse; if he is innocent in the one Case, he may prove the Man said to be killed to be still alive; and the Horse said to be stolen, never to have been out of his Master's Stable, &amp;c. And this I think is proving a Negative.</HI> Now I must think, in my turn, that it is strange a Gentleman of his Sagacity, who owns he was prepar'd for the Objection, could not yet hit upon some of those many Exceptions which every Body knows. For he does no more than give two Instances of one Affirmative being destroy'd by ano∣ther that infers a Negative of the first, at which Rate most Negatives may be proved, and then the old Rule may be discarded. Thus if it is shewn that a
<PB N="9" REF="011573_0005_0F8746FBDAFF1260"/>
Man is alive, it follows clearly that he was not kill'd; and if a Horse is proved to have been always in his Master's Stable (for this is what must be understood of his being never out of the Stable) it certainly fol∣lows that he could not be stolen. So that, according to this new Scheme of Proof, he who is accused of killing a Man, or stealing a Horse, is to be put upon proving that he did not kill or steal; because it is possible that such Proof may be had sometimes: And so in the principal Case, if a Question arises whether a certain Magistrate has done particular Acts of In∣justice or not, the Method is to shew that he did not do such Acts, not that he did them. I have touch'd upon this, not for its Importance, but as a Specimen of the learned Barrister's Manner of reasoning, and of the Spirit with which he sets out from the beginning.</P>
<P>At length, however, he takes the <HI>Onus probandi</HI> upon himself, and rather than the Thing should go unproved, generously undertakes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 24.</NOTE> at his Client's Peril, to prove the Matters charged in the Information as libellous, to be true. But I would be glad to know, by the Way, how this undertaking Gentleman could have proved the Truth of diverse Facts contained in the Paper which the Defendant published, supposing the Court had been so much over seen as to let him into a Proof of this Sort. Could he prove, for Example, that <HI>Judges</HI> were arbitrarily displaced and new <HI>Courts</HI> erected, in the Province of <HI>New-York,</HI> without Consent of the Le∣gislature? For I am credibly inform'd, there never was a Pretence or Surmise of more than <HI>One Judge</HI> being displaced, or more than <HI>One Court</HI> erected under Mr. <HI>Cosby</HI>'s Administration, both which happen'd up∣on one and the same Occasion. Now I would not have this esteem'd a captious Exception, when I have to deal with a Man of Law, who must or ought to know, that if such a Justification as he offer'd were at all al∣lowable, it ought to be full and express, so as to leave no Room for a Libeller to multiply and exaggerate Facts, at his Pleasure, when he is disposed to traduce
<PB N="10" REF="011573_0006_0F8746FD38553BF0"/>
Persons in Authority; there being a manifest difference between a single Act of Power without or against Law (from which perhaps few Governments have been free) and an habitual Abuse of Power in repeated In∣stances of the same Species. I would further ask, how he could prove <HI>that the Law itself was at an End, and that Tryals by Juries were taken away when a Governor pleased;</HI> for if I mistake not, he was, at that Time speaking to a Jury in a regular Court of Law, and in a Prosecution which the Governor had much at Heart (as the Gentleman himself insinuates) and would have been highly pleased to convict his Client, yet would not attempt it but in the ordinary Course of Tryal by a Jury, and then too could not find a Jury that would convict him. I think I am warranted in putting these Questions, even by the Authority of the Barrister himself,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 30, 31.</NOTE> who says—<HI>Truth ought to govern the whole Affair of Libels, and yet the Party accused runs Risque enough, even then; for if he fail of proving every Tittle he has wrote, and to the Satisfaction of the Court and Jury too, he may find to his Cost,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But for the present, I will suppose Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> was able to prove all these Things; nay that the Jury knew them all to be true. I will go further and allow, that Juries in criminal Cases may determine both Law and Fact, when they are complicated, if they will take such a Decision upon their Consciences (which is almost the only Point in which I can have the Honour of agreeing with him) yet after all these Concessions, the main Question rests still between us, viz. <HI>Whether a Writing can be a Libel, in legal Accep∣tation, if the Matter contained in it be true.</HI> He is pleased indeed, to express his Dislike of infamous Pa∣pers, even when they are true, if levell'd against pri∣vate Vices and Faults; and in this Case he calls them <HI>base,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 27. 28.</NOTE> <HI>unworthy, scandalous, unmanly and unmannerly.</HI> But surely it might be expected, when a Point of Law was in Question, that he would have told us whether they
<PB N="11" REF="011573_0006_0F8746FD38553BF0"/>
were lawful or unlawful, innocent or criminal, since these last are the only Epithets that were relative to his Subject, tho' the first might have their Weight in a Sermon or moral Essay. But it is plain, he was aware of the Consequence of being explicit upon this Head: for had he own'd such Writings to be lawful because true, he would have alarmed the common Sense of Mankind, by opening a Door for exposing at Mercy, the Frailties, Vices, Defects and Misfortunes of every Person high and low, which must inevitably destroy the Peace of Families, and beget ill Blood and Dis∣orders. If on the other Hand, he had acknowledg'd such Writings to be unlawful inasmuch as they con∣cerned private Miscarriages and Transactions; but that every Man might write as much Truth as he pleased about the Administration of the Government, not only by pointing out Faults and Mistakes, but by publishing his own Comment and Inferrences in order to fill the Minds of the People with all the Jea∣lousies and Apprehensions his Imagination can form; it must have shock'd Men of Understanding to be thus told, that the Law had provided against private Quarrels and Breaches of the Peace occasion'd by vi∣rulent Writing, but had taken no Care to prevent Sedition and publick Disturbances arising from the same Cause.</P>
<P>His favourite Position, however, was to be main∣tain'd at all Events; and therefore when <HI>the Chief Justice</HI> rightly instructed him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 22.</NOTE> that he could not be admitted to give the Truth of a Libel in Evidence, <HI>that the Law was clear that he could not justify a Libel; for it is never the less a Libel tho' it is true;</HI> the discerning Gentleman was pleas'd to understand by the word <HI>justify, a Justi∣fication by Plea, as it is in the Case of an Indictment for Murder, or an Assault and Battery; there</HI> (says he) <HI>the Prisoner cannot justify but plead not guilty: yet in Mur∣der, he may prove it was in Defence of his Life, his House, &amp;c. and in Assault and Battery, he may give in
<PB N="12" REF="011573_0007_0F8746FDC0BF1210" MS="y"/>
Evidence that the other Party struck first, and in both these Cases he will be acquitted.</HI></P>
<P>If the Party in either Case is acquitted, the Reason is I presume, because the Matter given in Evidence amounts to a Justification in Law of the Fact charged on him, and is equivalent to a Confession and Avoid∣ance in pleading. In like Manner, if Truth be a sufficient Justification of a Libel, the Defendant will be acquitted upon proving the Contents of his Paper to be true.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 25.</NOTE> Now let it be observed, that the Words of the Book which the Chief Justice relied on are these—<HI>It is far from being a Justification of a Libel, that the Contents thereof are true, since the greater Appearance there is of Truth in any ma∣licious Invective, so much the more provoking it is.</HI> That this is good Law, I hope I shall be able to shew fully hereafter, as I shall shew, in the mean Time, that it is an express Authority against the well-read Barrister,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 22.</NOTE> who declares, <HI>he has not in all his reading met with an Authority that says, he cannot be admitted to give the Truth in Evidence, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>He seems to take it for granted (and I shall not dis∣pute it with him now) that Matter of Justification cannot, in any Case, be pleaded specially to an In∣dictment of <HI>Assault or Murder;</HI> but the Party is to take Advantage of it in Evidence upon <HI>not Guilty</HI> pleaded. Let it be so; yet still this Matter must be a sufficient Justification, or the Party can have no Benefit from it any way: In an Action of Assault and Bat∣tery, where the <HI>first Assault</HI> must be pleaded specially; the Matter of Justification is just the same, as in an Indictment for the same Offence, where it must be given in Evidence upon the General Issue. I ask them, whether the <HI>first Assault</HI> is a Justification in an Indictment of Assault and Battery; If the Barrister should answer negatively, such Answer is against all Sense, for the Party, is acquainted by Virtue of the Justification only. If he should answer Affirmatively, he is inconsistent with himself, for he has but just Af∣firm'd
<PB N="13" REF="011573_0007_0F8746FDC0BF1210" MS="y"/>
that when the Book says, <HI>Truth is no Justificati∣on,</HI> it must be understood of a Justification by Plea, by which he must mean that nothing else is a Justificati∣on but what is pleaded, or he must mean nothing at all. For the Words of the Book are—<HI>it is far from being a Justification,</HI> &amp;c. it is not said—<HI>you are far from being at Liberty to plead it in Bar.</HI> In Truth, the Author is not there speaking of the Forms and Rules of Proceedings upon Libels,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Hawk. Ch. 73. S. 5. 6. 7.</NOTE> but upon the Substance and the Nature of the Crime, what shall and what shall not excuse or justifie it. This is ma∣nifest from the Reason subjoined to support his Asserti∣on, viz. <HI>Since the greater Appearance there is of Truth, &amp;c.</HI> which is a solid Reason grounded on the Wisdom of the Law, which punishes Libels, even against private Persons, as Publick Offences, because they provoke Men to Acts of Revenge and Breaches of the Peace. I hope it will not be said, a Libel is less provoking, be∣cause the Truth of it is to be given in Evidence than if it was to be pleaded in Bar.</P>
<P>But all this is <HI>Star-chamber-Doctrine,</HI> with the Bar∣rister, and the very Mention of that Court serves him for an Answer to every Thing, for which he has no other Answer; because the Memory of that Tribunal is justly detested on account of many illegal and exorbi∣tant Proceedings. No, this is the Authority of Mr. <HI>Serjeant Hawkings</HI> (tho' he uses Marginal References to some Star-Chamber-cases) whose Name is too great to receive any Addition from this Paper, and who after a long and studious Search in the Crown-Law, laid down this Proposition for Law at the Time he wrote his Book; and I believe it will appear, in the Sequel that he was not mistaken. And now I come to join Issue with the Barrister upon this Point, whether Mr. <HI>Serjeant</HI> or he is in the right; or in other Words whe∣ther Falsity in Fact be essential to a Libel, so that the Truth of the Fact may be given in Evidence to prove.<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 28.</NOTE> Writing to be no Libel.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="011573_0008_0F8746FE1DD0E770" MS="y"/>He maintains the Affirmative of the Question, <HI>both from what he understands to be the Authorities in the Case, and from the Reason of the Thing.</HI> All which shall be consider'd in their Order.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Barbados</HI> Gazette, No. 440. <HI>Remarks on</HI> Zenger's TRYAL, <HI>continued.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Authorities cited by Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> to support the Proposition formerly stated, consist princi∣pally of four Cases, which I shall consider in the Or∣der as they were produced.</P>
<P>The first is the Case of <HI>John de Northampton,</HI> 18 Ed. III.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeng. Tryal, P. 23.</NOTE> 3 Inst. 174. which he ob∣serves does not appear to have been a Case upon an Information, but that <HI>he has good Grounds to say it was upon an Indictment.</HI> This is what I shall not contest with him, because it is not material, or indeed easy to be determin∣ed, without seeing the Record; tho' I conceive there are Grounds to say it was not upon an Indictment, as was the Case of <HI>Adam de Ravensworth,</HI> mention'd by <HI>Lord Coke</HI> in the same Chapter. The Case, however, stands thus; <Q><HI>John de Northampton,</HI> an Attorney of the King's Bench wrote a Letter to one <HI>Ferrers,</HI> one of the King's Council, that neither Sir <HI>William Scot,</HI> Chief Justice, nor his Fellows the King's Jus∣tices, nor their Clerks, any great Thing would do by the Commandment of our Lord the King, &amp;c. which said <HI>John</HI> being called, confess'd the Letter, &amp;c. <HI>Et quia praedictus Johannes cognovit dictam literam per se scriptam, Roberto de Ferrers, qui est de concilio Regis, quae litero continet in se nullam veritatem: Proetextu cujus Dom. Rex ergo Curium &amp; Justiciarios suos habere posset indignationem, quod esset in scandalum Justic. &amp; Curiae. Ideo dictus Johannes committitur,</HI>
<PB N="15" REF="011573_0008_0F8746FE1DD0E770" MS="y"/>
&amp;c.</Q> Here says the Barrister, <HI>by this Judgment it appears the libellous Words were utterly false, and there the Falshood was the Crime, and is the Ground of the Judgment.</HI> For my own Part, I can neither see <HI>Truth nor Falshood</HI> in the Words at the Time they were wrote, for they refer to a future Contingency that might or might not be as he said; and in this Respect, they were the same as if the Man had said, the Roof of West∣minster-hall would fall upon Sir <HI>William Scot,</HI> and his Fellows. Besides, the Words taken by themselves have no ill Meaning; for I imagine it will be allowed that most of <HI>the great Things</HI> which Judges do, as Jud∣ges, are such as ought neither to be done nor left un∣done by the King's Commandment. Where then was the Offence? The Record, I think, shews that in the following Words; <HI>proetextu cujus Dom. Rex ergo Curi∣am &amp; Justic. suos habere posset indignationem,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Idoe dictus Johannes committitur,</HI> &amp;c. It is observeable, that the Author of this Letter was an Attorney of the Court, and by the Contents thereof he presumes to undertake for the Behaviour of the Judges in some great Matters that concerned their Office. The Letter was address'd to a Person who was of the King's Council and might possibly communicate the Contents of such a Letter to the King; the Consequence of which might naturally be that; <HI>Dom. Rex habere posset indignationem ergo Cu∣riam,</HI> &amp;c. for great Things were some Times done, in those Days, by the Kings Commandment, and the Judges, besides, held their Posts at Will and Pleasure.</P>
<P>The Words, <HI>quoe litera continet in se nullam veritatem,</HI> were therefore proper for the Judges to insert, in Order to acquit themselves to the King; but they are no more the Ground of the Judgment than these other Words; <HI>qui est de Concilio Regis,</HI> both being only incidental Clauses that come in by way of Discription: For it is not said; <HI>quia litera praedicta continet in se nullam veri∣tatem.</HI> After all, I would not have this Construction of the Case, plain and natural as it is, pass meerly upon my own Credit; for I shall shew that this Case was so understood by one of the greatest Lawyers of his

Time, before Lord <HI>Coke</HI>'s 3d Inst. appeared in the World.</P>
<P N="21">21. Jac. <HI>B. R. Tanfield</HI> v. <HI>Hirom,</HI> Godb. 405, 6.</P>
<P>The Plaintiff brought an Action upon the Case against the Defendant, for delivering of a scandalous Writing to the Prince, &amp;c. <HI>Noy</HI> for the Plaintiff cited, 18 Ed. III. a Letter was sent to <HI>Ferrers,</HI> one of the King's Council, the Effect of which was, that <HI>Scot,</HI> Chief Justice, and his Companions of the same Bench, would not do a vain Thing at the Command of the King; <HI>yet because he sent such a Letter to the King's Council, altho' he spake no Ill, yet because it might incense the King against the Judges, he was punished.</HI> If no Ill was said, will it be pretended that the Falshood of what was said could be a Reason for punishing a Man? Is it not ridiculous to say that the Falshood of inno∣cent or insignificant Words can be Criminal? This Book therefore follows the Record of <HI>Northampton</HI>'s Case, and says; because it might incense the King against the Judges, he was punish'd; which is almost a Translation of <HI>praetextu cujus,</HI> &amp;c. which was the Ground of the Judgment, <HI>Idio Committitur.</HI></P>
<P>The next Case which the Barrister called to his Aid, is that of <HI>the Seven</HI> Bishops; <HI>State Tryals,</HI> vol. 4. and here he relies on a Flourish of one of the Council for the Bishops, and a dubious Expression of one of the Judges, separated from the Rest of his Discourse.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Robert Sawyer,</HI> 'tis true, says <HI>both the Falsity of it</HI> (the Libel) <HI>and that it was malicious and seditious, are all Matters of Fact, which they</HI> (the King's Council) <HI>have offer'd to the Jury no Proof of,</HI> &amp;c. This I must confess, proves one Point to which the Barrister adduced it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 23.</NOTE> viz. <HI>That he was not the first who insisted, that to make a Writing a Libel, it must be false.</HI> And when I have allow'd this, I may almost venture to say, it is the only Point he does prove from the Beginning to the Ending of his long elaborate Speech. Let me, however, oppose to this the Reply of Sir <HI>Thomas Powis,</HI> in these Words; <HI>whether a Libel be true or not, as to the Matter
<PB N="17" REF="011573_0009_0F8746FEDD615CC0" MS="y"/>
of Fact; was it ever yet permitted in any Court of Jus∣tice to be made a Question; whether the Party be pu∣nishable for it? And therefore I wonder to hear these Gentlemen say, that because it is not a false one, therefore it is not a Libel.</HI> Fol. 382.</P>
<P>Mr. Justice <HI>Powel</HI> also does say; <HI>that to make it a Libel, it must be false; it must be malicious; and it must tend to Sedition.</HI> Upon which Words of this learned and worthy Judge, I would not presume to offer any Comment, except that which other Words of his own afford, that plainly shew in what Sense he then spoke. His subsequent Words are these: <HI>They</HI> (the Bishops) <HI>tell his Majesty it is not out of Averseness to pay all due Obedience; nor want of Tenderness to their dissenting Fellow Subjects; but because they do conceive the Thing that was commanded them, was against the Law of the Land; they say, they apprehend the Declaration is illegal, because it is founded on a dispensing Power. I do not remember in any Case in all our Law, that there is any such Power in the King; and the Case must turn upon that. In short, if there be no such dispensing Power in the King, then that can be no Libel, which they presented to the King, which says that the Declaration, being found∣ed upon such a pretended Power, is illegal.</HI> So that the Judge put the whole upon that single Point, whether it be true that the King had such a dispensing Power, or not; which is a Question of Law, and not of Fact; and accordingly the Judge appeals to his own Read∣ing in the Law, not to Witnessess or other Testimony, for a Decision of it. In Truth the Petition of the Bishops is not capable of having Falshood or Truth apply'd to it in any other Sense, there being nothing else affirm'd or deny'd in it, <HI>but that they thought they could not do what was commanded them, because it was against the Law.</HI> This was the Behaviour; these were the Sentiments of that upright Judge, that gain'd him so much Honour among all good Men, as the Barrister takes Notice, not any Opinion of his, that the Contents of a Libel must be false in Fact, to make it a Libel;<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 24.</NOTE> as he would unfairly insinuate.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="011573_0010_0F8746FF9C316458"/>Sir <HI>Samuel Barnardiston's Case</HI> is the third that is touch'd upon; and here too the Gentleman finds no∣thing that can be strain'd to his Purpose, but the De∣fendant's Council <HI>insisting on the want of Proof to the Malice and seditious Intent of the Author.</HI> He seems to have forgot that the same Gentleman insisted also to have it proved, <HI>that the Defendant was a Person of a turbulent and unquiet Spirit,</HI> because these Words were set forth in the Information, and he takes no Manner of Notice how all this was answer'd; which I must now do for him, in the Words of the Court; <Q>Cer∣tainly the Law supplies the Proof, if the Thing itself speaks Malice and Sedition. As it is in Mur∣der; we say always in the Indictment, he did it by the Instigation of the Devil: Can the Jury, if they find the Fact, find he did it not by such Instigation? No, that does necessarily attend the very Nature of such an Action or Thing. So in Informations for Offences of this Nature, we say, he did it falsely, maliciously, and seditiously, which are the formal Words; but if the Nature of the Thing be such as necessarily imports Malice, Reproach, and Scan∣dal to the Government, there needs no Proof but of the Fact done; the Law supplies the rest. How shall any Man prove another Man's Malice, which is a Thing that lies only in a Man's Mind? How should any Man know that I am malicious against the Government, but by my Actions?</Q> These Words, indeed, were pronounc'd by <HI>the Chief Justice Jefferies,</HI> who was then the Mouth of the Court; but tho' he was really an intemperate Judge (or a <HI>Monster,</HI> as the Barrister in <HI>his</HI> Bar-Language, delights to call him) yet I may safely refer it to all Men of Law, whether these Words could have discredited the best Mouth that ever spoke upon that Bench. State Tryals, Vol. 3. 939.</P>
<P>An Instance of this Sort may not be impertinent, where a Chief Justice (who was no <HI>Monster</HI>) addresses himself to a Jury, that was trying a Libel, in this Manner; <Q>I will not repeat the Particulars to you,
<PB N="19" REF="011573_0010_0F8746FF9C316458"/>
only something to what the Defendant has said, that you may not be misled. He says it does not appear that he did it maliciously or knowingly. There are some Things that you that are of the Jury are not to expect Evidence for, which it is impossible to know but by the Act itself; Malice is conceiv'd in the Heart; no Man knows it, unless he declares it. As in Murder, I have Malice to a Man; no Man knows it. I meet this Man and kill him; the Law calls this Malice. If a Man speak scandalous Words against a Man in his Call∣ing or Trade; he lays his Action, Malice; tho' he cannot prove it but by the Words themselves; you may see, there is Malice supposed to a private Person in that Slander, much more to the King and the State.</Q> State Tryals, Vol. 2. 537.</P>
<P><HI>Tutchin's Case,</HI> the Barrister does not properly cite, but endeavours to answer as a Case urged against him by the King's Council; and therefore I shall observe upon it in another Place.</P>
<P>But the Case of Cases is still behind, which he reserved for the last,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 24.</NOTE> <HI>to make the Point clearer on his Side,</HI> than all the rest put together could do. It is <HI>Fuller</HI>'s Case. State Tryals, Vol. 5. 441, 6, 7, 8; and it deserves Notice, that altho' <HI>Fuller</HI> was charged with writing a Libel, yet <HI>that</HI> was not the Gist of the Information. He was in Truth prosecuted for being <HI>a Cheat and Imposter,</HI> by Order of the House of Lords, as the King's Coun∣cil declare in the Opening.</P>
<P>The Information accordingly sets forth, <Q>That <HI>W. F.</HI> intending the late <HI>King William</HI> and his Subjects to deceive; and to get several great Sums of Money fraudulently and deceitfully from the said King; concerning a Correspondency between di∣verse Officers and Subjects of the said late King, and <HI>the late King James</HI> falsely pretended to be had; did write and print a Libel, entitled, Original Let∣ters, &amp;c. with the Deposition of <HI>T. J.</HI> and <HI>T. F.</HI> Esqrs, proving the Corruption lately practised in
<PB N="20" REF="011573_0011_0F87470078C81A30"/>
this Nation; and the said <HI>W. F.</HI> afterwards did publish, utter, and for Truth affirm the said several false and scandalous Libels, without any lawful Authority; <HI>whereas in Truth the said T. J. did not depose upon his Oath, as is contained in the said false and scandalous Libel; but the said scandalous Libels are false, feigned, and altogether contrary to the Truth,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Here it is manifest he was accused of a Cheat, in forging <HI>the Correspondence and the Depositions</HI> just mentioned, with a Design of getting Money by his pretended Discovery. And hence it comes, that the Judge very properly asks him, <HI>have you any Witnesses? If you take upon you to write such Things as you are charged with, it lies upon you to prove them true, at your Peril. How came you to write those Books that are not true? If you have any Witnesses pro∣duce them. Thus said, and thus did that great Man, Lord Chief Justice Holt;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 24.</NOTE> but not upon a Tryal of the like Kind with Mr. <HI>Zen∣ger</HI>'s, as his Council would have it thought. For in this Case the <HI>Cheat</HI> and the <HI>Imposture</HI> was the Offence, which consisted wholly in the Falsity; that is, in affirming such Things for <HI>Realities,</HI> when they were nought but <HI>Fictions.</HI> On the contrary, had he been able to prove those <HI>Letters</HI> and those <HI>Depo∣sitions</HI> to be authentic, the Discovery would have been valuable, and might intitle him perhaps to Favour and Protection, instead of Punishment; however irregular he was in taking such a Method to publish Matters of that high Consequence. After this, let the learned Barrister, <HI>in all his Reading,</HI> shew an Information or Indictment for a <HI>Libel,</HI> where the <HI>Falsity</HI> is assigned in Form with an <HI>ubi revera,</HI> as the Foundation of the Offence; which is done in <HI>Fuller</HI>'s Case; and then I will acknowledge that the Questions put here by <HI>Lord Holt,</HI> would have been proper upon the Tryal of his Client.</P>
<P>This is the Sum of the Barrister's Law-Cases. And is it not high Time to ask, whether such gross Misre∣presentations of the Books can proceed from Ignorance
<PB N="21" REF="011573_0011_0F87470078C81A30"/>
or Disingenuity? Be that as it will; it might certainly be expected, that a Proposition advanced with so much Assurance, <HI>by a Man of Years and Reading,</HI> should have been supported by some One Authority in Point, rather than by a Series of low Prevarication and Quib∣ble. Could he not find in all the Book-Cases and Tryals at large concerning <HI>Libels</HI> (which are sufficient of themselves to make a large Volume) one example of Proof being received to the Truth or Falsity con∣tained in a libelious Writing? Indeed there is no∣thing like it to be found; tho' the Occasions have been many, where such Proof might be had, if it were pro∣per; nay where the Truth of the Thing was notori∣ous to all Men, and yet no Question ever moved con∣cerning it. This shall fully appear in the Sequel.</P>

<P>IF any Thing can be necessary further to expose Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Doctrine of <HI>Libels,</HI> after answer∣ing his own Cases, it is only to subjoin some others that will shew how much he is mistaken in almost every Thing he has offer'd on the Subject. I shall there∣fore mention a very few, that will bear a particular Application to his crude Notions; without entering into a Multitude of others, to overload this Paper, and tire the Reader.</P>
<P>16 <HI>Car.</HI> 2. The <HI>King,</HI> v <HI>Pym.</HI> 1 Sid. 219. B. R.</P>
<P><HI>Pym</HI> was indicted at <HI>Exeter,</HI> for a Libel, which he deliver'd to a Parson to be publish'd in Church there, and was to this Effect; <Q>You are desired to bewail the Sodomitry, Wickedness, Whoredom, Lewdness, that is of late broken out in this formerly well-govern'd City, that God would turn their Hearts from com∣mitting
<PB N="22" REF="011573_0012_0F87470439AF5968"/>
those Wickednesses which go unpunished by the Magistrates.</Q> <HI>Pym</HI> confess'd the Indictment, and was fined 100 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> He afterwards brought a Writ of Error, and assign'd for Error that this was no Of∣fence, because tho' he says, <HI>go unpunished by the Ma∣gistrate,</HI> yet he does not say that the Magistrate knew of it; and Wickedness unknown cannot be punished. It was answer'd by the Court, that this contains Mat∣ter of great Scandal to the Government of the City, for it makes the late Government better than the pre∣sent, &amp;c. <HI>Hide, Twisden, Keiling, Windham,</HI> Just.</P>
<P>I have pitch'd upon this Case, because the Barrister is fond of comparing the Plantations to large Corpo∣rations;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeng. Tryal. P. 20.</NOTE> and he will find here that even those are not left to the Mercy of Libellers, <HI>altho' they do not put in a Claim to the sacred Rights of Majesty:</HI> And that a Misbehaviour of this Kind to the Magistrates of a Corporation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 21.</NOTE> is not entirely innocent, <HI>because it is not to be judged of, or punished, as a like Undutifulness would be to our Sovereign.</HI></P>
<P>This Case was adjudged about four Years after the <HI>Restoration,</HI> when the Memory of the preceeding Usur∣pation was fresh in every Body's Mind. It is strange therefore Mr. <HI>Pym</HI> did not put himself on his Tryal at <HI>Exeter,</HI> for it is evident beyond Contradiction to the People of that Age, from their own Knowledge, as it is now to us from History, that the Wickedness speci∣fied in the Libel was restrain'd by a stricter Hand be∣fore, than after the Restoration. But this notorious Truth, it seems did not avail Mr. <HI>Pym.</HI> 22. <HI>Car.</HI> 2. the King. v. <HI>Saunders.</HI> Raym. 201. B. R.</P>
<P>Information for writing a scandalous Libel to <HI>H. Rich.</HI> who was indebted to him, and kept him out of his Money three Years, by obtaining a Protection, and at length getting into the Prison of the King's Bench. <HI>Saunders</HI> wrote him a Letter, wherein he tells him, <Q>That if he had any Honesty, Civility, So∣briety, or Humanity, he would not deal so by him;
<PB N="23" REF="011573_0012_0F87470439AF5968"/>
and that he would one Day be damned, and be in Hell for his Cheating;</Q> and cited several Places of Scripture to make good his Allegations. The De∣fendant was found <HI>Guilty,</HI> and moved in Arrest of Judgment, that the Substance of the Letter is not scandalous but impertinent and insignificant, &amp;c. <HI>Cur.</HI> The Letter is provocative, and tends to the incensing Mr. <HI>Rich.</HI> to break the Peace. The Court adjudged the Letter scandalous, and fin'd him forty Marks. <HI>Keiling, Twisden, Rainford, Moreton, Just.</HI></P>
<P>I would entreat the clear-sighted Barrister, to look carefully into the Words of this Libel, and try if he can discover any Truth or Falshood in them that was capable of Proof; and I must remark upon both these Cases, that tho' they were adjudged in the Reign of K. Charles II. yet neither of them was upon a State Pro∣secution, or at a Time when the Spirit of <HI>Plots and Factions,</HI> had infested the Courts of Justice; but they remain unquestionable Authorities at this Day.</P>
<P>State Tryal, Vol. 5. The Case of <HI>Tutchin</HI> is strong against him; a Case adjudged since the Revolution, before that learn'd and upright Judge Sir <HI>John Holt;</HI> and plainly shews the Fallacy that runs throughout his whole Argument.</P>
<P>The Points insisted on by this <HI>Chief Justice,</HI> in his Charge to the Jury, were these; <Q>To say that cor∣rupt Officers are appointed to administer Affairs is certainly a Reflection on the Government If Peo∣ple should not be called to an Account for possessing the People with an ill Opinion of the Government, no Government can subsist; now you are to con∣sider, whether these Words I have read to you, do not tend to beget an ill Opinion of the Administra∣tion of the Government; to tell us that those that are employ'd know nothing of the Matter, and those that do know are not employ'd. Men are not adop∣ted to Offices, but Offices to Men, out of a parti∣cular Regard to their Interest, and not to their Fitness for the Places. This is the Purport of these Papers.</Q> If this was the Purport of the Pa∣pers,
<PB N="24" REF="011573_0013_0F87470552B88E88"/>
and so criminal as hath been just said; it is amazing, surely, that Mr. <HI>Tutchin</HI> did not offer to prove the Truth of these Allegations, and thereby take out their Sting. Could not he possibly think of as many corrupt or incompetent Officers, Ecclesiastical, Civil, or Military, in <HI>England,</HI> prefer'd by Interest rather than Merit, <HI>as there were Judges displaced and Courts erected in New-York?</HI> Or if he was restrain'd by the hard hearted Judge, from desporting himself in this pleasant and spacious Field, could he not apply to the private Knowledge which the Jurors (as well as the Rest of Mankind) had of these Matters? For I imagine it will be allowed, that if no Instances of this Sort could be shewn at the Time of <HI>Tutchin</HI>'s Tryal, it was the only Period within the Memory of Man, or the reach of History, that wanted the like.</P>
<P>But the Misfortune was, the poor Man was not bless'd with such skilful Council as is to be had in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> to think of these good Things for him; otherwise you might have heard an alert Advocate <HI>(after returning Thanks to his Lordship for nothing)</HI> address himself to the Jury in this or the like eloquent Strain;<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 25.</NOTE> <Q>then, Gen∣tlemen of the Jury it is to you we must appeal for Witnesses to the Truth of the Facts we have of∣fer'd and are deny'd the Liberty to prove; the Law supposes you to be summon'd out of the Neighbour∣hood where the Fact is alledged to be committed; and the Reason of your being taken out of the Neighbourhood is, because you are suppos'd to have the best Knowledge of the Fact that is to be tried. And were you to find a Verdict against my Client, you must take upon you to say the Papers referr'd to in the Information, and which are proved to be written and published by us, are false, scandalous and seditious. You are Citizens of <HI>London,</HI> honest and lawful Men; and the Facts which we offer to prove were not committed in a Corner; they are notoriously known to be true. And as we are deny'd the Liberty of giving Evidence to prove the Truth
<PB N="25" REF="011573_0013_0F87470552B88E88"/>
of what we have published, I will beg Leave to lay it down as a standing Rule in such Cases, that the suppressing of Evidence ought always to be taken for the strongest Evidence, and I hope, it will have that Weight with <HI>you.</HI> Lay your Hands upon your Hearts, Gentlemen, and recollect. Do none of you know; nay, do not all of you know certain Per∣sons, who shall be nameless, that have been lately promoted by Favour and Interest, to Places of Trust and Profit both in Church and State, Army and Navy; whom you must know and believe in your Consciences to be ill Men, and no way quali∣fied for such Preferment; as my sagacious Client has most seasonably remonstrated to the Neighbours, by Virtue of that Right which every free born Subject hath of publishing his Complaints, when the Matters so published can be sup∣ported with Truth?<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 17, 29.</NOTE></Q> But is <HI>Lord Holt</HI> asleep all this Time; can any rea∣sonable Man, who has but common Notions of Ju∣dicature, imagine that this great Judge would suffer such Trash as this to be thrown out in any Court where he sat in Judgement? But what must he have said if the Libeller before him had offer'd to prove, <Q>that the Law itself was at an End; that Tryals by Juries were taken away when a Minister pleas'd; that no Man could call any Thing his own, or en∣joy any Liberty longer than those in the Admini∣stration would condescend to let him do it?</Q> Would he have said that these Things did not tend to possess the People with an ill Opinion of the Government, and that Governments might well subsist, tho' Men should not be called to an Account for publishing the like? Or would he have said, it was no Matter what Opinion the People had of the Government, nor whe∣ther it subsisted or not, provided these Assertions were true; and so have discharged the Man as a Publisher of precious and useful Truths <HI>to put the Neighbours on their Guard?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="011573_0014_0F8747059A5F1170"/>But here also the Barrister lays hold of a Random-Question, put by one of the King's Council to Mr. <HI>Montague,</HI> who was for the Defendant and was then touching upon the Affairs of the Navy. Saith the former, <HI>will you say they are true?</HI> Now the latter had hinted as much as that these Things were true; but did it with that Caution which a Man of Skill uses, when he would say something in Support of a lame Cause, but don't care to press an Impropriety too far. For that learned Gentleman was very sensi∣ble, that if he had presum'd to insist expresly on the Truth of the Matters contain'd in his Clients Papers, a severe Reprimand was the best Thing that could have befallen him. His Words are these; <HI>no Body can say, that we never had any Mismanagements in the Royal Navy; and whenever that has happen'd the Merchants of</HI> England <HI>in all probability have suffer'd for it.</HI> But does the Judge, in his Charge to the Jury, vouchsafe to give this Matter any Answer, or so much as to mention it? <HI>Lord Holt,</HI> did not usually pass by mate∣rial Things that were offer'd in Defence of Persons tried before him; yet in this Case he makes no Questi∣on or Scruple about the Truth or Falshood of <HI>Tutchin</HI>'s Papers, altho they contain'd many Things which his Lordship, the Jury, and all the World knew to be ****. This candid Judge, however, puts the Merits of the whole upon the Scandal of the Government, and the evil Tendency of such Writings. And there∣fore I must once more call upon the Northern Barri∣ster to shew a single Instance where Witnesses have been produced by Council, and admitted by the Court to prove the Truth of a Libel. When he does this, it will deserve Consideration; but till then he may talk by the Hour without any Meaning.</P>
<P>I could mention some Cases of a more modern Date, that have been adjudged in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> when this wild Doctrine was not so much as thought of, and when it would not have been altogether use∣less had it been practicable; but I have chose to men∣tion
<PB N="27" REF="011573_0014_0F8747059A5F1170"/>
such only as are reported, that the Books may speak for themselves, and Judge between us.</P>
<P>But this Lawyer seems to be above having his Points of Law decided by Authorities of the Law; and has something in Reserve, which may serve to overthrow not only what has been offer'd in this Pa∣per, but even all the Books of the Law. This is what he calls <HI>the Reason of the Thing,</HI> but is truly and properly a Sketch of his own <HI>Politicks;</HI> which leads me to shew that <HI>the true Reason of the Thing</HI> here, a∣grees with the <HI>Law,</HI> and consequently both these are against this expert Master of Law and Reason.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="article">
<HEAD><HI>From the</HI> Barbados <HI>Gazette, No. 442.</HI> Remarks on Zenger's Trial, continued.</HEAD>
<P>THE <HI>Reason of the Thing,</HI> as well as it can be col∣lected from a Heap of Particulars huddled toge∣ther without Order and Method, may be reduced to the three following Heads.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Form of an Information for a Libel, and the Necessity of knowing the Truth or Falshood of its Contents, in order to direct the Judges in award∣ing arbitrary Punishment.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Right every Man hath of publishing his Complaints, when the Matters so published can be supported with Truth.</P>
<P N="3">3. The Necessity there is of using this Right, in the Plantations especially, by Reason of the Difficulty of obtaining Redress against evil Governors by any other Means.</P>
<P N="1">1. It will not be improper to premise, under the first Head, that a Gentleman of the Law, who takes upon him to pronounce so magisterially, as the Nor∣thern Barrister has done concerning <HI>Libels,</HI> ought to have consider'd well the Nature and Extent of his
<PB N="28" REF="011573_0015_0F8747065BE81AA0"/>
Subject. It might be expected that he is not unknow∣ing in any Part of Learning necessary to fix his Idea of a <HI>Libel</HI> And yet the present Case would appear to be quite different. This learned Gentleman might have inform'd himself by reading some of the ancient Laws before the Conquest, that when the <HI>Falsity</HI> of virulent Writings and Speeches was taken into the Description of the Crime, there was a specifick Pe∣nalty annex'd, viz. <HI>Cutting out the Offenders Tongue. Lamb. Sax Laws.</HI> But this Severity seems to have fallen into Disuse under the Norman King's; and ac∣cordingly <HI>Bracton;</HI> who wrote in the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> III. gives a Description of these Offences as they were understood in his Days, wherein <HI>Falsity</HI> is nei∣ther express'd nor imply'd. These are his Words; <HI>Fit autem injuria, non solum cum quis pugno percussus fuerit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, vuneratus, vel fustibus coesus; ve∣rum cum ei Convitium dictum fuerit, vel de eo factum Carmin famosum &amp; hujusmo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> Fol. 155. Indeed here is no mention of <HI>Libeis against the King or the State;</HI> the Reason of which seems plainly to be, that Offen∣ces of this Sort were considered as a Species of <HI>Trea∣son,</HI> not only in that Age, but in several Ages after, notwithstanding the Statute of 25 <HI>Ed.</HI> III. and tho' they have by happy Degrees dwindled into <HI>Misdemea∣nours,</HI> yet no body except the Barrister will say they are come to have a greater Indulgence from the Law, than the like Offences against private Persons. How far therefore <HI>Bracton</HI>'s Acceptation of a <HI>Libel</HI> has pre∣vailed ever since, must be submitted upon what has been offer'd in the preceeding Part of the Remarks.</P>
<P>Here the Barrister threws in a shrewd Question, arising from the Form of the Informa∣tion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeng. Tryal. P. 21.</NOTE> which charges the Libel to be <HI>false This Word FALSE,</HI> say he, <HI>must have some Meaning, else how came it there? I hope Mr. Attorney will not say he put it there by Chance; and I am of Opinion his Information would not be good without it.</HI> By way of Answer to this, I must take leave to put a Question or two in the same Strain.

Suppose a Man brings an Action of <HI>Trespass,</HI> for vio∣lating his Wife, and he fairly sets forth the Truth of the Case. <HI>viz.</HI> That the Defendant, <HI>by amorous Ad∣dresses, Letters, Presents,</HI> &amp;c. did gain the Consent of the Plaintiff's Wife, and at length debauched her, I would ask, whether an Action of <HI>Trespass</HI> thus laid can be supported? I fancy not; and yet this is a more just Account of the Matter, than when <HI>vi &amp; armis,</HI> viz. <HI>Swords, Staves, Knives,</HI> &amp;c. are introduced as Instruments of invading this tender Part of our neigh∣bours Property. Suppose further, a Man kills another whom he never saw or heard of before; and he is ac∣cused of Murdering him <HI>of Malice fore thought.</HI> How come such Words to be put into an Indictment for a Fact so circumstanc'd? They must have some Mean∣ing; surely they are not put there by Chance; and I am of Opinion the Indictment would not be good without them. Why, there is this short Answer to be given to all these childish Questions. There are many Words used in Pleadings of most kinds, sometimes for Aggravation, sometimes for Comprehension, often in Compliance with ancient Usage, which are not tra∣versable, and many Times are incapable of Proof. The Form of Indictments and Informations follows the Nature of the Fact, and sets it out in its worst Dress; and if the Fact is made appear to be unlawful, all the hard Names are supply'd by Implication of Law. This is not all,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 23.</NOTE> quoth the Councel∣lor; <Q>it is said that Truth makes a Libel the more provoking; well, let us agree for once that Truth is a greater Sin than Falshood; yet as the Offences are not equal, and as the Punishment is arbitrary; is it not absolutely necessary that they should know whether the Libel is true or false, that they may by that Means be able to proportion the Punishment; for would it not be a sad Case, if the Judges, for Want of a due Information, should chance to give as severe a Judgement against a Man for writing or publishing a Lie, as for writing or publishing a Truth?</Q> Now is it not a sad Case
<PB N="30" REF="011573_0016_0F874707BAE49960"/>
that he should Want to be told, that human Laws don't strictly regard the moral Pravity of Actions, but their Tendency to hurt the Community, whose Peace and Safety are their principal Objects; so that by this Standard only are Punishments measur'd. If this pro∣found Sophister is of another Opinion, let him give a Reason why it should be a greater Crime in our Law for a Man to Counterfeit a silver Shilling than to cut his Father's Throat.</P>
<P N="2">2. The Right of remonstrating or publishing just Complaints, the Barrister thinks the Right of all Free∣men: And so think I, provided such Remonstrances and Complaints are made in a lawful Way. But when he comes to explain, it is not a Court of Justice, it is not an House of Representatives, it is not a Legisla∣ture that is to be troubled (as he phrases it) with these Things, Who then I pray, is to be troubled with them;<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 29.</NOTE> for <HI>the King</HI> it seems is out of the Question? Let the Barrister speak for himself; <HI>they have a Right (says he) publickly to remon∣strate the Abuses of Power, in the strongest Terms, to put their Neighbours upon their Guard,</HI> &amp;c. and in another Place he speaks of it as a Hardship, <HI>if a Man must be taken up as a Libeller, for telling his Sufferings to his Neighbour.</HI> Now tho' I wish and hope, as earnestly as he can do, that a free People may never want the Means of uttering their just Complaints, and of re∣dressing their Wrongs too, when their Complaints are not heard; yet I always thought these Things were better understood than express'd in a Court of Law; and I shall probably remain in that Opinion till the learned Gentleman can produce something from the <HI>Common</HI> or <HI>Statue Law,</HI> to shew that a British Subject has a Right of appealing publickly <HI>to his Neighbours</HI> (that is, to the collective Body of the People) when he is injur'd in his Person, Rights, or Possessions. When I am assur'd that he can do this, I promise him I shall not grudge a Voyage to that Country,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 39.</NOTE> <HI>where Liberty is so well under∣stood and so freely enjoyed,</HI> that I may re∣ceive
<PB N="31" REF="011573_0016_0F874707BAE49960" MS="y"/>
the important Discovery from his own instruc∣tive Mouth.</P>
<P>I know the Law Books assert the Right of Com∣plaining to the <HI>Magistrates and Courts of Justice,</HI> to the <HI>Parliament,</HI> to the <HI>King</HI> himself; but a Right of complaining to the <HI>Neighbours</HI> is what has not occur'd to me. After all, I would not be thought to derogate, by any Thing I have said or shall say, from that noble Privilege of a free People, <HI>the Liberty of the Press.</HI> I think it the Bulwark of all other Liberty; and the surest Defence against Tyranny and Oppression. But still it is a Two-edged Weapon, capable of cutting both Ways, and is not therefore to be trusted in the Hands of every discontented Fool or designing Knave. Men of Sense and Address (who alone deserve publick Attention) will ever be able to convey proper Ideas to the People, in a Time of Danger, without running counter to all Order and Decency, or crying <HI>Fire</HI> and <HI>Murder</HI> thro' the Streets, if they chance to awake from a frightful Dream. But I must again urge, that these Points are not fit to be discuss'd in a Court of Justice, whose Jurisdiction is circumscribed by positive and known Laws. Besides, they take Place properly in a sovereign State which has no Superior on Earth; and where an injured People can expect no Relief but from an Appeal to Heaven. This is far from being the Case of Colonies; and therefore I come to shew, under the third Head, that the Barrister's <HI>Reason of the Thing</HI> in no other than <HI>Reason inverted,</HI> which possibly may help the Project of a <HI>Demagogue</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> but can never be reconcil'd to the Sentiments of a Law∣yer, or the Principles of a Patriot, consider'd as a Sub∣ject of <HI>Great-Britain.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. I have hitherto been taught to believe that when a brave and free People have resorted to measures un∣authoris'd by the ordinary Course of the Laws; such Measures have been justified by the extraordinary Ne∣cessity of the Case, which excluded all other Means of Redress. And as far as I understand the Consti∣stitution, and have heard Accounts of the <HI>British</HI> Co∣lonies,
<PB N="32" REF="011573_0017_0F87470830F7B888"/>
such a Case cannot well happen, and has ne∣ver yet happen'd among them. But here the Barrister is ready to ask, how must we behave when we are oppress'd by a Governor, in a Country where the Courts of Law are said to have no coercive Power over his Person, and where the Representatives of the People are, by his Intrigues, made Accomplices of his Iniquity? Certainly it can't be a new Discovery to tell this Lawyer; that as the Governor is a Crea∣ture of the <HI>Crown,</HI> so the most natural and easy Course is to look up to the Hand that made him. And I imagine it may be affirm'd (without catching an Oc∣casion of offering Incense to <HI>Majesty</HI>) that if one half of the Facts contain'd in <HI>Zenger</HI>'s Papers and vouched for true by his Council, had been fairly represented and proved at home, Mr. <HI>Cosby</HI> would not have con∣tinued much longer in his Government; and then the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> might have ap∣plied to itself the Inscription of the Gold-Box;<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 44.</NOTE> <HI>demersae leges, temefacta libertas, hae tandem emergunt;</HI> with greater Propriety and Se∣curity, than could possibly be derived from the impe∣tuous Harrange of any Lawyer whatsoever. I am the more embolden'd to say thus much, because tho' it is my Lot to dwell in a Colony where <HI>Liberty has not always been well understood, at least not freely enjoy'd,</HI> yet I have known a Governor brought to Justice with∣in these last twenty Years, who was not only sup∣ported by a Council and Assembly, besides a numerous Party here, but also by powerful Friends at Home; all which Advantages were not able to screen him from Censure, Disgrace, and a Removal from the Trust he had abused.</P>
<P>It is not always necessary that particular Persons should leave their Affairs and Families in the Plantati∣ons to prosecute a Governor in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> un∣less their Fortunes are equal to the Expence. For it is seldom seen that the Violence of a bad Governor terminates in private Injuries; in as much as he can't find his Account in any Thing less than what is of a
<PB N="33" REF="011573_0017_0F87470830F7B888"/>
general and publick Nature. And when this is the Case, I hope none of our Colonies are, even at this Time, so destitute, but that they can find the Means of making a regular Application to their <HI>Sovereign,</HI> ei∣ther in Person or in his Courts at <HI>Westminster,</HI> as their Case may require.</P>
<P>But the wild Inconsistency that shines through most Parts of this Orator's Speech,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 28.</NOTE> is peculiarly glaring in that Part of it now before me. The Remedy which he says our Constitution prescribes for curing or preventing the Diseases of an evil Administration in the Colonies, I shall give in his own Words; <HI>has it not been often seen (and I hope it will always be seen) that when the Re∣presentatives of a free People are, by just Representati∣ons or Remonstrances, made sensible of the Sufferings of their Fellow-subjects, by the Abuse of Power in the Hands of a Governor, they have declared (and loudly too) that they were not obliged by any Law to support a Go∣vernor who goes about to destroy a Province or Colony,</HI> &amp;c. One would imagine, at first Sight, that this Man had the same Notion, with the Rest of Mankind, of just Representations and Remonstrances to the Represen∣tatives of a free People, which has ever been under∣stood to be by Way of Petition or Address directed and presented to them in Form; in which Case it is hoped that they, being moved by the Complaints of the People, will stretch forth their Arms to help them. But alas!<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 29.</NOTE> We are all mistak∣en; for he tells us, in the same Breath, that the right Way is by telling our Sufferings to our Neighbours, in Gazettes and News-Papers; for the Representatives are not to be troubled with every In∣jury done by a Governor; besides they are sometimes in the Plot with the Governor, and the injured Party can have no Redress from their Hand; so that the first Complaint (instead of the last Resort) must be to the <HI>Neighbours,</HI> and so come about to the Representa∣tives through that Channel.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="011573_0018_0F874708A0F9F0B8"/>Now I would be very glad to know, what the <HI>Neighbours</HI> can do towards effecting the desired Refor∣mation, that will be attended with so good Success and so few ill Consequences, as a regular Application to his Majesty would be. It would be pleasant, doubt∣less, to hear this Politician speak out, and explain himself at large, upon this Subject. I confess it sur∣passes my Comprehension to conceive what the <HI>Neigh∣bours,</HI> inspired with weekly Revelations from the City Journalist, can do with their Governor or Assembly, unless it be to reform them by those persuasive Argu∣ments which the <HI>Major vis</HI> never wants good Store of. If this be the <HI>Patriot's</HI> Meaning, his Words may possibly be understood; but without this Meaning they are meer <HI>Jargon.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word; I shall agree with the Barrister (and so take my Leave of him) that <HI>the Liberty of exposing and opposing arbitrary Power,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 39.</NOTE> is the Right of a free People; and he ought at the same Time to admit that, The order of Things and the Peace of Society require that extraordinary Means should not be used, for this Purpose, till the Ordinary have failed in the Ex∣periment. The supreme Magistrate of an <HI>independant Kingdom or State,</HI> cannot always be controul'd by the one, and then the other is justified by that Consider∣ation. But in <HI>Colonies,</HI> that are from their Creation subordinate to the Mother-Country, there is no Per∣son who is not controulable by regular and well known Methods of proceeding; and consequently there can be no absolute Necessity of flying to Extremities, at least in the first Instance. From all which, I con∣ceive, it follows, that <HI>local Considerations</HI> upon which the Gentleman lays so great Stress, conclude directly against him; and I hope the Security which the <HI>Bri∣tish</HI> Constitution affords to every Man's Person, Pro∣perty, and Reputation, as well as to the publick Tran∣quility, is not lessen'd by any Distance from the Foun∣tain of Power and Justice; but that a <HI>Libel</HI> is a <HI>Libel,</HI> and punishable as such in <HI>America</HI> as well as in <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="011573_0018_0F874708A0F9F0B8"/>I am sensible, there is a Freedom of Expression used in these Papers, of which I should disapprove in the common Cases of Controversy; but I found my self under a Necessity of shewing no Respect to the Performance under Consideration, unless I were to forfeit the little that might be due to the <HI>Remarks.</HI> For tho' a Lawyer is free, nay oblig'd by the Duty of his Profession, to make the most of the Cause he e∣spouses, (his real Sentiments being suspended for that Time, by Reason of the Biass under which he acts) yet when he draws his private Opinion into the De∣bate, and interests his Passions in the Success of it, he then departs from his Character, and becomes a <HI>Party</HI> rather than an <HI>Advocate.</HI> In short, there is an Air of self Sufficiency and Confidence mixt with the whole Lump, enough to give a Disrelish even to good Sense and good Law, but is Nauseous beyond all bearing, when neither of these is found: Among Lawyers, I was sure this Lawyer deserv'd no Answer, and yet an Answer seem'd indispensible, not only for the Reasons given at my setting out, but also in order to save many well meaning People from reverencing a Piece of <HI>Buffoonry,</HI> that had been thrust into the World with so much florid Conceit and a Gold-Box tagg'd to the End of it. A Piece, wherein the whole common-place of popular Declamation (equally adap∣ted to all popular Occasions) is exhausted, and <HI>the holy Scriptures</HI> brought in to season his Jokes. But as this last seems design'd only for a Sally of <HI>Wit and Humour,</HI> I shall not offer to detract from its Merit; considering too it had so happy an effect as to set the good People a laughing, when they heard <HI>the Word of God,</HI> most ingeniously burlesqu'd in a <HI>Christian Court.</HI> A Piece that hardly shews the Author to have been serious when he pronounc'd it, or his wise Benefactors when they rewarded him; but that his solemn Profes∣sions of <HI>Principle and Duty</HI> compel a charitable Mind to suspect his Knowledge rather than his Sin∣cerity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P. 41, 42.</NOTE> and <HI>Citizens</HI> are over thought to be in earnest when they part with their <HI>Gold</HI> and shew their <HI>Learning.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T must be mortifying, no doubt, to a Person who has received peculiar Marks of public Approbation, to be told, that the very Act which procur'd it was so far from being commendable, that it really deserved a severe Censure; and one wou'd the rather decline such an Office, how just soever the Occasion, because it cannot be done with∣out condemning at the same Time, the Judgment of those whose Sufferage had been thus unworthily ob∣tain'd. But when the Laws are openly perverted, and Courts of Justice, with an Air of Gravity, <HI>droll'd</HI> out of their established Rules by such whose Profession supposes them Ministers of Justice, and when this too shall be dignify'd with Applause, and made highly meritorious; I conceive neither good Nature, nor the Solemnity of <HI>public Seals</HI> should restrain an honest Pen from exploding the Practice, in Order as well to stop the Progress of its evil Effects, as to prevent the like Attempts for the future.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="011573_0020_0F87470A1D3EB990"/>Virtue and Merit, it is most certain, ought to be encouraged, especially by all in Authority; but when that which is meerly counterfeit shall gain Esteem, stand in the Room of what is truly genuine, and be actually loaded with the Rewards thereof, it does not only frustrate the Original Intention of such Rewards, but likewise give Countenance to the Impostor, and furnish him with still further Means of vending his false Wares, in Prejudice of the Public. Now this, with all due Submission, I take to be the Case of the <HI>Corporation</HI> in <HI>North-America,</HI> with Regard to the Honours they were lately pleased to confer on a <HI>noted Barrister</HI> in those Parts, for his supposed Services in the Affair of <HI>Zenger</HI> the Printer, whose <HI>Tryal</HI> has been so plentifully dispers'd here, and in other Places. Ag∣gregate Bodies, we find may be mistaken, and too often are, as well as private Men; and when they do err, it is of the more dangerous Consequence, on Account of the Extent of their Power and Influence. The Province in general of <HI>New-York,</HI> or the City in particular might, for ought I know, have sufficient Cause of Complaint, in some Respects, against their then Commander in Chief and his Administration; but it is to be considered that as there never was one absolutely free from Faults, so it is the great Privilege of the Inhabitants of every <HI>British</HI> Government that a proper Channel is chalk'd out, in all such Events, and a Way open for Relief. The Method therefore which the Constitution prescribes ought to be strictly pursued, and any illegal Deviation is not only incon∣sistent and unjustifiable in itself, but has, besides, a Tendency to introduce Mischiefs more to be dreaded even than those that were sought to be redress'd. It is the Law which must be the Standard of Right and Wrong; and whoever has recourse to any other Aid, or knowingly advises thereto, in the Case of particular Grievances, cannot action a true Principle of publick Spirit, but must be influenced by unworthy Motives, and is always more or less an Enemy to the Community, according to his Situation, and in Proportion to the
<PB N="39" REF="011573_0020_0F87470A1D3EB990"/>
Talents he happens to possess. If Mr. <HI>Zenger</HI> then will avowedly publish seditious Libels against the Go∣vernment under which he lives, and his Council will offer to support him by Artifices unbecoming the long Robe, and advancing Propositions manifestly contrary to Law; as the former deserves to be punished by it, so the latter I humbly presume to say, whatever he may claim from his Client, ought not to be paid his Wages by any Set of Men who owe their Being to the Law, and cannot exist without it.</P>
<P>But I shall not scruple to acknowledge here, and I do it on no superficial Observation, that there can't be a more pernicious Creature in a distant Colony, than that of a Practitioner of the Law, with much Assurance, little Knowledge, and no Morals; a Cha∣racter not unheard of in more than one of his Ma∣jesty's Plantations, and which yet I wou'd by no Means apply to Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> any otherwise than may appear to be just from the Performance he has, it seems, taken so much Pains to publish to the World. The judicious Remarks already made upon it, by <HI>Anglo-Americanus,</HI> will hardly leave Room for any Thing to be added that is very material, and therefore I shall content myself with a few <HI>Gleanings</HI> only, and make some cursory Reflections thereon, whilst they afford me an Opportunity of bearing my Testimony also against what I think the most undecent Behaviour at least, if it may not be called the boldest Outrage that ever was exhibited from the Bar without a suitable Chastisement.</P>
<P>Whoever has enquired into the Doctrine of <HI>Libels,</HI> and the Reason of their Punishment will perceive that they take their Degrees, as they affect private Per∣sons, particular Magistrates, or are aim'd against the Government itself; and I may venture to say that no Lawyer of Reputation will deny, but what is set forth in the Information against <HI>John Peter Zenger</HI> was of this last Kind, and that too, conceived in the gros∣sest Terms, such as will not admit of a different Con∣struction, or of any other meaning than what is put
<PB N="40" REF="011573_0021_0F87470B802A7B00"/>
upon them by the Prosecutor for the Crown. Now I am sensible that great Allowances are with good Reason made to Council in the Heat of Argument, and when supposed to be animated with a laudable Zeal for their Clients. Nor has it been usual to cor∣rect them for every harsh and hasty Expression, pro∣vided they keep within Bounds, and stick to that which is their Duty without running into Matters that have no Relation to the Issue, and cannot fairly serve the Side they espouse. Yet, as the Lord Chancellor <HI>Not∣ingham</HI> occasionally said, <HI>Council should not speak as if they would abet the Guilt of their Client rather than Advocate for their Innocency.</HI> And since your ingeni∣ous Correspondent, has clearly evinced that the Truth of a Libel cannot be given in Evidence, that it is no Justification, on the general Issue, and conseqently no proper Defence to a Charge of that Nature; of all which Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> cou'd not, (or ought not to have been ignorant) it is worthy of Consideration whether he did not involve himself in his Client's Crime, and partake of his Guilt, by declaring in the most publick Manner, that the Facts published in the News-Papers, and contain'd in the Information, were true, and offering to prove them to be so before a Court which had no Power to redress the Grievances complain'd of. 4 <HI>Co.</HI> 14. <HI>Hob.</HI> 266, 7.</P>
<P>Sir <HI>Bartholomew Shower,</HI> I remember in his Argu∣ment in the Case of the <HI>King</HI> against <HI>Berchet &amp; al.</HI> asserts, that <Q>in all Cases of Contempts to a Court, no Presentment is necessary, no not so much as to convict; for if done in <HI>Facie curiae,</HI> a Record may be made of it, and a Punishment judicially in∣flicted, and that executed immediately. <HI>Show. Rep.</HI> 110.</Q> And agreeable hereto, we find that in a late Case of the <HI>King</HI> against <HI>Thorogood. Trin.</HI> 9 <HI>Geor. primi,</HI> the Defendant having made an Affidavit in <HI>C. B.</HI> and appearing on Summons, confess'd that he made it, and that it was false; whereupon the Court recorded his Confession, and order'd that he should be taken into Custody and stand in the Pillory, &amp;c.
<PB N="41" REF="011573_0021_0F87470B802A7B00"/>
which was executed accordingly the last Day of the Term. <HI>Mod. Ca. in Law &amp; Eq.</HI> 179, 180. This is the more remarkable because it was in the Court of Common Pleas, which has ordinarily no Jurisdic∣tion in Criminal Cases—May it not from hence be inferr'd (I hint it with a due saving to all the just Privileges of the Bar) that the Court at <HI>New-York</HI> might well have recorded some of the most seditious Expressions in Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s Rhapsody, and com∣mitted him for the same, &amp;c. If they had, I doubt the Blame must have center'd in himself, and his own Conduct; of which therefore he might then have had leisure to repent, as well as of his <HI>long Journey</HI> to so ill a Purpose.</P>
<P>But it will not be amiss perhaps, for Example Sake, to give an Instance of what has been done on the like Occasion with that before us; and to this End I shall cite a Case in the Court of King's Bench, many Years after that of the Star-Chamber was at an End, and which in the Words of Sir <HI>Thomas Raymond,</HI> was as followeth; <Q><HI>Memorandum, June</HI> 18, 1680. Mr. <HI>Nathaniel Reading</HI> having been convicted (before Justices of Oyer and Terminer by Virtue of a special Commission) for endeavouring to persuade <HI>Bedlow,</HI> who was a Witness against the Nobleman imprison'd in the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> to forbear his Prosecution of them; and he the said Mr. <HI>Reading</HI> having had Judgement executed upon him by being set in the Pillory, and fin'd 1000 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and imprison'd for the same, but his Fine since pardon'd by the King, came this Day into Court, and demanded that an Information which he there brought in his Hand might be received by Mr. <HI>Astrey</HI> against the Commissioners who condemn'd him, of which my Brother <HI>Jones</HI> and Brother <HI>Dolben</HI> were two, and that the Information may be filed. But the Court did declare that he was in the wrong Way to exhi∣bit any Information in this Manner, and did cause his Words, whereby he did accuse the two Judges of Oppression to be recorded; and for these Words,
<PB N="42" REF="011573_0022_0F87470B9D39E730"/>
and for that he was infamous by having been in the Pillory, the Gentlemen at the Bar did pray that his Gown might be pull'd over his Ears, he having been formerly a Practiser at the Bar, which was ordered and executed in Court; and he was also condemn'd in Court to pay the King 500 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> and to lie in Prison till he paid it. <HI>Raym.

Id.</HI> p. 374, 5. Far be it from me to make any invi∣dious Comparison here betwixt the present Practiser in <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> and the <HI>quondam</HI> one in <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> tho' they are both celebrated, the one in the Tryal of Mr. <HI>Zenger,</HI> and the other in that of his Own. It may however be noted that the Latter was said to be <HI>artful and affectedly eloquent,</HI> and to have <HI>strove to lead the Judges out of the Way,</HI> while he was told by the Chief Justice that his <HI>Defence was artificial, because 'twas nothing to the Purpose;</HI> and by another of the Judges, that he <HI>disgrac'd his Profession by making so weak a Defence.</HI> But without adverting to any parti∣cular Beauties in the <HI>modern Performance,</HI> this is cer∣tain that Counsellor <HI>Reading</HI> lost the Bar Gown by his <HI>Art,</HI> and Counsellor <HI>Hamilton</HI> got a Gold-Box of five Ounces with the Freedom of the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> by <HI>his.</HI> A pregnant Instance of the Capriciousness of Fate, and of the Justness of your late Correspon∣dent's Observation at the Entrance to his excellent Remarks!</P>
<P>The Gentlemen of the Bar (as indeed it might well be expected from their Education and the Nature
<PB N="45" REF="011573_0022_0F87470B9D39E730" MS="y"/>

But that the Lawyer of <HI>Philadelphia</HI> may see the Courts of Justice in former Ages, as well as of late Years, did not spare the un∣ruly Members of the Profession, any more than others, for a much less faulty Behaviour than that of the lead∣ing Council in <HI>Zenger</HI>'s Tryal, I will refer him to a Case which happen'd, <HI>Mich.</HI> 13. <HI>Eliz.

<P>Before I proceed, I will mention one Case more, purely to shew how dangerous it is to afford any unlawful Helps to Persons on their Tryals in Criminal Prosecutions, even tho' it be meerly by way of private Instructions, when such Instructions are to be pub∣lickly made use of, and import Scandal to the Govern∣ment. It is the Case of the <HI>King</HI> against <HI>Aaron Smith, Mic.</HI> 35. <HI>Car.</HI> 2. in <HI>B.

an <HI>Information,</HI> so much enviegh'd against by <HI>Zenger</HI>'s Counsel, and yet I never heard it censur'd at all, as was that of poor <HI>College,</HI> I own, with too good Reason.</P>
<P>It is now Time to take Notice, that there is amidst a Heap of Jargon and Absurdities, one obvious Mis∣take which runs throughout Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s ostenta∣tious Harangue, and that is in Relation to the Court of Star-Chamber. He would suggest that because that Court was abolished by Act of Parliament, on Ac∣count of some insufferable Abuses that had crept into it, all the Cases that had been adjudged there, on Informations for Libels, were consequently of no Authority. Whereas the Judgments given there, in Matters properly cognizable before them, which Libel∣ing especially was, are allowed to be good Law at this Day, and are constantly quoted, as such, in the Court of King's Bench. Indeed it is said that the Reason of disallowing the Star-Chamber Court, was because their Authority was before and now is in <HI>B. R.</HI> and consequently that Court unnecessary, <HI>Comb.</HI> 36. So the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Holt</HI> declared that <HI>B. R.</HI> possest all the lawful power the Star-Chamber had, <HI>Id.</HI> 142. And that the Court of Star-Chamber was taken away, because the Crimes were punishable here, 5. <HI>Mods</HI> 464; which is likewise intimated by the Statute itself. Now tho' I am as well satisfyed, perhaps, with the taking away of the Court of Star-Chamber, consider∣ing the Occasion that had been given, as our northern Barrister can possibly be, and should equally rejoice, I hope, at the redressing any other public Grievance; yet I cannot, with him, condemn by the Lump, and argue, that because that Court did some Things amiss, therefore it did nothing right. At this Rate, every Court that had, or has a Being, may be in Danger of the same Epithets he loves to bestow on that we are speaking of; and it may as well be suppos'd, that because a certain Set of Citizens, not unknown to Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> lately did a very <HI>silly</HI> Thing, they therefore never did a <HI>wise</HI> one. For which Reason I presume it will not be altogether impertinent to pro∣duce
<PB N="45" REF="011573_0023_0F87470D40960258"/>
the Sentiments of that Oracle of the Law, Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI> concerning the Court of Star-Chamber. <HI>It is</HI> (says he) <HI>the most honourable Court, our Parliament excepted, that is in the Christian World, both in Respect of the Judges, and of their honourable Proceedings accord∣ing to their just Jurisdiction, and the ancient and just Orders of the Court. For the Judges of the same are the Grandees of the Realm, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord Treasurer, the Lord President of the King's Council, the Lord Privy Seal, all the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and others of the King's most honourable Privy Council, and the principal Judges of the Realm, and such other Lords of Parliament as the King shall name. And they judge upon Confession, or Deposition of Witness. And the Court cannot sit for hearing of Causes, under the Number of eight at the least. And it is truly said</HI> Curiae Camerae Stella<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ae, si vetustatem spectemus, est antiquissima, si dignitatem honoratissima. <HI>This Court, the right Insti∣tution and ancient Orders thereof being observed, doth keep all</HI> England <HI>in quiet.</HI>" Conformable hereto, a late learned Writer, who has advanced to the highest Post in the Law in a neighbouring Kingdom to that of our Mother Country, and wherein he dy'd has a Para∣graph, which I believe will give us a truer Account of the Court itself, and the Abolishment of it, than what is to be learnt from our Barrister's Speech at <HI>New-York,</HI> and therefore I will insert it here. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Disc. concerning Treasons and Bills of Attaind. P. <HI>94.</HI> Printed <HI>Anno 1716.</HI></NOTE> <HI>The Court of Star-Chamber, whilst kept within due Bounds, was certainly of the greatest Use to preserve the Peace and Security of the Kingdom; and perhaps was the only Court which by its</HI> ordinary and proper <HI>Jurisdiction, cou'd ef∣fectually prevent and punish Riots, Perjuries, and other Misdemeanors of the highest Nature. But being made use of by the Court to support Proclamations and Orders of State, and to vindicate illegal Commissions and Monopo∣lies, that Extension of their Power became a Grievance insupportable, and the Nation was never easy till that

Court was entirely suppress'd by Act of Parliament.</HI> The House of Commons <HI>were so eager in their Zeal to destroy what they call'd a</HI> Court of Inquisition, <HI>that tho' the Bill was of so great Consequence, yet they sent it up to the Lords, with only once reading it, and without its being ever committed, which was a Thing, perhaps never before heard of in Parliament.</HI> Cla. V. 1. 223.</P>
<P>I need only add on this Head that the Crime of <HI>Libelling</HI> is the same now as it was while the Court of Star-Chamber subsisted, and the Nature of the Of∣fence the same then, as now; a Crime that must necessarily be punished, as long as there are States and Communities established in the World. And our assuming Barrister will not find an Author that treats of the Crown Law since the Statute of 16 <HI>Ch.</HI> 1. <HI>Ch.</HI> 10. any more than before, but makes use of the Cases adjudged in the Star-Chamber generally as good Law, and of equal Authority in those Matters with such as were afterwards adjudged in the King's Bench. Some indeed are justly liable to Exception in the for∣mer, as we have also known too many in the latter, particularly during the next succeeding Reign of <HI>Ch.</HI> 2. none whereof are, however, God be praised, to be met with, or heard of since the glorious and happy Revolution in 1688, which I trust has for ever exclu∣ded all Partiality and Oppression from <HI>Westminster-Hall.</HI></P>
<P>But the learned Lawyer of <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> declares that <HI>he has not in all his reading, met with an Authority that says we cannot be admitted to give the Truth in Evi∣dence upon an Information for a Libel.</HI> I don't know what this Gentleman's reading may be; but if he had read some of the Cases above mentioned which cou'd not well escape him, it might reasonably have been expected he would have taken Warning, been a little more cautious, and not have ventur'd to incur the Penalties which others before him had so justly suffer'd. By <HI>all his Reading,</HI> he wou'd insinuate, I suppose, that he had <HI>read all;</HI> and if that was true, it might well be thought he had read to very little Purpose, who
<PB N="47" REF="011573_0024_0F87470DE348F198"/>
could make so ill an Use of it; or think it <HI>a Duty on him to go to the utmost Part of the Land,</HI> to propagate Doctrines and Principles diametrically opposite to, and just the Reverse of what he must have read. We shall soon discover that the Barrister's Reading is not quite so extensive as he would have it imagin'd. But it is previously to be observed that if there were no such Authority <HI>in terminis</HI> as that he calls for, a Man who reads with any tolerable Understanding wou'd of Course infer the same Thing, when all the Books on the Subject of Libels lay it down as a Rule, which they unanimously do, <HI>that it is not material whether the Libel be true or false.</HI> For if that be not material, to what end shou'd the Truth be offer'd in Evidence? Or how shou'd it be rejected before, it was offer'd which undoubtedly is the Reason that there have been no late Instances of that Sort. It might suffice there∣fore to undertake as often as this well-read Lawyer produced a Precedent of its being demanded from the Bar to give Evidence of the Truth of a Libel, to shew that it was as often deny'd by the Court. And tho' I admit it has been attempted before, on Tryals for Libels of the less enormous Kinds, yet he is pro∣bably the only one that has done it in any Case within these 100 Years. However if we would find an In∣stance of that Sort, we must necessarily have Recourse to the Proceedings of the Court where that Crime was usually punished. The <HI>Star-Chamber Reports</HI> then may satisfy Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> that <HI>Term Pase.</HI> 7 <HI>Car.</HI> 1. there was the Case of <HI>Coston,</HI> Gent. v. <HI>Hitcham Mil Servien. ad legem,</HI> as follows. <Q>The Defendant the Morning before he went to the Sessions, being a Justice of the Peace, received scandalous and li∣bellous Articles against the Plaintiff, carry'd them to the Sessions in his Pocket, and in open Court, in disgrace of the Plaintiff, pull'd them out, and said you shall see what a lewd Fellow this is, and not fit to speak in this Place, and then cause the said libellous Articles to be read in the publick Ses∣sions. And the Plaintiff then desiring a Copy of
<PB N="48" REF="011573_0025_0F8746BB4BF33440"/>
them and to be try'd upon them, the Witnesses to prove them being noted in the Margin, the Defen∣dant did not suffer him to have a Copy or to be try'd there upon, nor took any Course that he might at the next Sessions, or at any Time after be question'd for them, but took the Articles again out of the Sessions and carried them away. And after, further to disgrace the Plaintiff in his Practice (being an Attorney) sent the said Articles to Mr. Justice <HI>Harvey</HI> at the Reference of a Cause to him, which <HI>Caston</HI> attended; and a Jury having given a Verdict against the Defendant, he sent for the Jurors and question'd them about their Verdict, and told them they were a Company of Fools, and that if there had been but one wise Man among them their Verdict had not been so And for these Of∣fences he was committed to the Fleet and fin'd 200 <ABBR>l.</ABBR> In this Cause, the Defendant wou'd have had Witnesses to prove the Matter of the said scan∣dalous Articles to be true, but that was disallowed by the Court. <HI>Rushw Col vol.</HI> 3. <HI>P.</HI> 36. <HI>in Ap∣pend.</HI></Q> This I presume the Barrister when he is serious will allow to be in Point, tho' it happen'd not to fall in the Way of his Reading. He cannot object surely that it does not appear to be on an Information prefer'd by an Attorney General, since it is a much stronger Case than if it had. For if the Court would not receive such Evidence in a Cause depending on the Complaint of a petty Sollicitor for being libell'd, and this too preferred against a Justice of Peace, a Knight and a Serjeant at Law, <HI>a fortiori,</HI> they wou'd never admit it on an Information exhibited by his Ma∣jesty's Attorney-General against a private Person for libelling the Government.</P>
<P>There was also as I have learnt, divers Years be∣fore, viz. <HI>Mich.</HI> 2 <HI>Jac.</HI> the Case of <HI>Peter B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eton</HI> Clerk, for writing a scandalous Letter to <HI>Loyd</HI> Regis∣ter of the Bishop of St. <HI>Asaph,</HI> and sent to himself, who was therein charg'd with Bribery and Extortion in his Office, for which libellous Letter the Defen∣dant
<PB N="49" REF="011573_0025_0F8746BB4BF33440"/>
was sentenc'd, tho' as the Book has it, <HI>he wou'd have undertaken to prove the Contents of the Letter to be true.</HI> Here then are two Precedents of what the Barrister himself had never met with in all his Read∣ing; the one in a Case for Libelling a practising At∣torney, and the other of the Register of a Bishop's Court; but I believe I may defy this Gentleman if he were to read as many more Years as he has done, to produce a <HI>third</HI> where the Offence under Prosecuti∣on, being of the highest Degree, and levell'd at the Government, like that for which he was so zealous an Advocate, the Council for the Defendant dar'd to offer Evidence of the Truth of it. On the contrary, if he had dipt into the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Keling</HI>'s Reports, Fol. 23. (before he left his Chambers) he would have there found it resolv'd by the whole Court that <HI>tho' a Counsellor at Law may plead his Client's Cause against the King, yet if under Colour of that, he takes upon him to vent Sedition, he is to be punish'd.</HI></P>
<P>It is no Wonder indeed, if our Barrister shou'd be unapprized of <HI>Brereton</HI>'s Case, it not being (at least to my Knowledge) in Print; and you perceive I was under no Necessity of mentioning it, being before provided with an Authority to my Purpose. But it is reported as above, in <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Part</HI> II. <HI>Consid.</HI> 12.</NOTE> Sir <HI>Thomas Mallet</HI>'s M. S. Treatise of the Court of Star-Chamber, a Copy where∣of has fallen into my Hands by the Favour of a Friend. And since I have named this Work, I shall, with his Leave take a Paragraph out of it, which I'm persuaded will not be deem'd unsuitable to the present Debate, after hinting that the Book seems to be wrote in the Time of <HI>James</HI> I. when the Doctrine now revived, and so tenaciously advanced by Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> is said to have been <HI>long before exploded as a gross Error.</HI> <Q>There are (says Sir Thomas) two gross Errors crept into the World concerning Libels; the one that it is no Libel if the Party put his Hand unto
<PB N="50" REF="011573_0026_0F8746BB5F9F61F8"/>
it; and the other that it is not a Libel if it be true; both which have been long since exploded out of this Court. For the first, the Cause why the Law punisheth Libels, is for that they tend to raise the Breach of the Peace, which may as well be done, and more easily when the Hand is subscribed, then when it is not. And for the other, it hath been ever agreed that it is not the Matter, but the Man∣ner which is punishable. For libelling against a common Strumpet is as great an Offence as against an honest Woman, and perhaps more dangerous to the Breach of the Peace; for, as the Woman said, she should never grieve to be told of her red Nose if she had not one indeed. Neither is it a Ground to examine the Truth or Falshood of a Libel, because it is <HI>sub Judice,</HI> whether it be a Libel or not; for that takes away <HI>Subjectum Ques∣tionis,</HI> and determines it to be no Libel, by admit∣ting the Defendant to prove the Truth, and the Defendant in that Case ought to plead a Justifica∣tion and Demur in Law; but if he plead not guilty, the Question is gone, whether it be a Libel or not.</Q> Thus, according to this Author's Opinion, who if I mistake not, was one of the Justices of the Court of King's Bench in his Time, Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> cou'd he really have persuaded himself that the Matters charged in the Information were not libellous, as he <HI>insists they are not,</HI> would have discovered more Accuracy in his Profession, as well as Candour in his Practice, by advising his Client to <HI>Demur</HI> to it, whereby he wou'd have admitted no more than what was avowed at the Tryal on the general Issue. Then indeed it would have fairly come before the Court to be considered whether the Papers were libellous or not, and he as Counsel for the Defendant, might regularly have been heard to it. He wou'd then have been at Liberty to exert his uncommon Talents, manifest his extraor∣dinary Reading, his superior Genius and great Skill in Language, and in explaining the true import of Words, without so directly flying in the Face of every Autho∣rity,
<PB N="51" REF="011573_0026_0F8746BB5F9F61F8"/>
and opposing all the Cases that ever were adjudged concerning <HI>Libels,</HI> before he was born, and since. But, alas! That wou'd not have answered the Inten∣tion of our eloquent Barrister. He wou'd not then have had it in his Power to use his Arts, and play his Game with a Dozen honest Men of as good natural Understandings perhaps, tho' not of equal Experience and Cunning with himself. If he had gone that way to Work, he wou'd have had no chance for the Prize. Vain had been his Expedition, and lost, entirely lost, all his Labour. In a Word, if the Learning and In∣tegrity of the Bar only were required, he might as well have stayed at home, where, if I am rightly in∣form'd, their are Instances in Abundance of the blessed Effects of Mr. <HI>Hamilton's well-known Princi∣ples.</HI></P>
<P>This sagacious Gentleman <HI>begs Leave to observe, that Informations for Libels, is a Child, if not born, yet nurs'd up and brought to full Maturity in the Court of Star-Chamber:</HI> But what is particularly to be inferr'd from this shrewd Observation, he does not at present tell us. If the Star-Chamber was the Court where Crimes of this Nature were generally punished, ac∣cording to its ordinary and proper Jurisdiction, as it certainly was, how should it be otherwise than that Informations for Libels must be met with there? And considering the Antiquity of that Court, 'tis more than probable the Crime was first prosecuted and pu∣nished in it. But what then? Is the Legitimacy of the Child (if I may be allowed to carry on the Metaphor) therefore to be call'd in Question? Or its Education the less honourable? I might put our witty Barrister in Mind, that what I have mentioned is the very Reason why the <HI>spurious Brat</HI> he is so fond of, which was never brought to full Maturity, nor ever will, first appeared in the Star-Chamber, tho' it has not been heard of since in any other Court till very lately at <HI>New-York,</HI> I mean that of making Falshood to be essential to a Libel, and claiming a Right to give Evidence of the Truth of it by Way of Justification.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="011573_0027_0F8746BC22063C50"/>He must however intend by the foregoing Passage to impeach the Legality of Informations <HI>qua</HI> such (which by some Words that drop from him many Pages after, would seem to be what he aims at) or as they relate only to <HI>Libels;</HI> and in either Case he will again betray the Scantiness of his Reading and Know∣ledge in the Law. As to informations in general, it has been incontestibly prov'd that this Method of Pro∣ceeding is <HI>no Way contrarient to any Fundamental Rule of Law, but agreeable to it.</HI> That it was the <HI>constant Usage and had the Approbation of the Judges and Law∣yers of all Ages, and in all Reigns.</HI> Show Rep. 106, to 125. And in the Case of the Information against Seventy poor Persons for a Riot in pulling down Fences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 2 <HI>W.</HI> and <HI>M.</HI> (which probably may be the same) it was said by Lord Chief Justice <HI>Holt,</HI> that <Q>the Lord Chief Justice <HI>Hales</HI> complain'd of the Abuse of Informations, but not that they were unlaw∣ful;—That he should not come now and impeach the Judgment of all his Predecessors;—That the Star-Chamber was not set up by the Statute of <HI>Hen.</HI> 7. but was at Common Law, and Informations were accordingly brought in that Court and others. And the whole Court were of Opinion that Infor∣mations lay at common Law, 5 <HI>Mod.</HI> 463, 4.</Q> Now this I take to be as good an Authority as the ex∣trajudical Opinion of those anonymous <HI>great Men</HI> who Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> says, <HI>have boldly asserted that the Mode of Prosecution by Information is a national Grievance, and greatly inconsistent with the Freedom which the Subjects of</HI> England <HI>enjoy in most other Cases;</HI> nor can one forbear observing, <HI>en passant,</HI> that he seems much more dis∣pos'd, where there is no Danger at least, to follow the Example of <HI>bold,</HI> than of <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>judicious</HI> Men.</P>
<P>This then being a legal Course of Proceeding in Criminal Cases, and for all publick Offences, it must undeniably be as proper in the Case of Libels as in any others. And Sir <HI>B. Shower</HI> in reckoning up the several Crimes that were cognizable in the Court of <HI>Star-Chamber,</HI> includes <HI>Libels</HI> among the rest, for
<PB N="53" REF="011573_0027_0F8746BC22063C50"/>
which he says, <HI>There were always Informations in the Star-Chamber and King's-Bench,</HI> Show. 119. I am the more free in borrowing what I do from that emi∣nent Practiser, on the Subject of Informations, because he had studied it well, and taken more than usual Pains therein; and as the Judgement afterwards given by the Court of King's-Bench was pursuant thereto, so it seems to have put a Period in Westminster-Hall to all Cavils against that <HI>Mode of Prosecution.</HI></P>
<P>If the Barrister means notwithstanding to suggest moreover, that Informations for Libels are but of mo∣dern Date, or little longer Standing then about the Time of the Expiration of that Court, where he supposes they had their Origin, let him be further refuted by the abovementioned Sir <HI>Thomas Mallet,</HI> who wrote professedly on the Court of Star-Chamber, and may be supposed to be pretty well acquainted with his Sub∣ject. He tells us, that <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treatise of the Court of Star-Chamber, <HI>ubi supra.</HI></NOTE> <Q>In all Ages Libels have been severely punished in this Court, but most spe∣cially they began to grow frequent about 42 and 43 <HI>Eliz.</HI> when Sir <HI>Edward Coke</HI> was her Attorney General.</Q> And, treating of the Antiquity of that Court he makes it very probable, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Id. <HI>1</HI> Part, 4th Consid.</NOTE> <HI>It was the most ancient of any Court of Justice, and the Mother Court of the Kingdom;</HI> wherein he does not differ from Sir <HI>Edward</HI> himself, in his 4th <HI>Inst.</HI> 64, already quoted. Now 'twas while this consummate Lawyer it seems was Attorney General to the renowned Queen <HI>Eliza∣beth,</HI> that Informations for Libels began to be most frequent, or in Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI>'s elegant Stile, when <HI>the Child was brought to full Maturity:</HI> And it is readily submitted to all who are vers'd in our His∣tory and Constitution, whether that Period will be any Disparagement to the Offspring.</P>
<P>But if Informations for Libels in particular were one of the Grievances of that Court, nay the chief, as the Barrister would labour to make his Hearers believe,
<PB N="54" REF="011573_0028_0F8746BD0DF8F720"/>
how came they to be practis'd after the Abolishment of it? Or what will he say to the Case of the <HI>King</HI> against <HI>Darby,</HI> which was an Information exhibited against the Defendant, being an Attorney of the Com∣mon-Pleas, for <HI>defamatory Words</HI> only of Sir <HI>John Key,</HI> a Justice of Peace, concerning the Exercise of his Office? The Words were, as they are set forth in <HI>Comb.</HI> 65. <HI>Sir</HI> John Key <HI>is a Buffle-headed Fellow,</HI> (a pretty Thing to be proved in Court!) <HI>understands not Law, and is not fit to discourse it with me; he hath not done Justice to my Client.</HI> There it was argued for the Defendant on a Demurrer, (and I choose to recite it because of the Concessions of his Council against our Northern Advocate) <Q>That an Informa∣tion would not lie for scandalous Words spoken only of a particular Person, because he might have an Action on the Case to recompence him in Da∣mages. 'Tis true such a Proceeding might be warranted for Libels, or for dispersing defamatory Letters, because by such Means the publick Peace might be disturbed, and Discords fomented amongst Neighbours, which might at last be a publick In∣jury: But there is no such Thing alledged in this Case, only Words in common Discourse, for which an Action on the Case might lie, but no <HI>Informati∣on.</HI> On the other Side it was insisted, That this Information was founded on sufficient Matter, be∣cause the Prosecution is not only as it respects the Person of Sir <HI>John Key,</HI> but it relates to him as he is a publick Magistrate, and who is subordinate to the Government, and therefore such defamatory Words are a Reproach to the supreme Governor, by whom Magistrates are intrusted and from whom they derive their Authority; and it will not be de∣ny'd, but that Words reflecting on the publick Go∣vernment are punishable at the Suit of the King by an Information.—And for this Reason the Court held that an Information would lie, and thereupon gave Judgment against the Defendant, and fined him an Hundred Marks. <HI>Carth.</HI> 14, 15.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="011573_0028_0F8746BD0DF8F720"/>Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> who would seem to be more know∣ing than his Neighbours in many Things, affects to be more ignorant than every Body, of what consti∣tutes a <HI>Libel;</HI> and therefore altho' he pretends <HI>freely to acknowledge there are such Things as Libels,</HI> yet he <HI>insists at the same Time, that what his Client is charg'd with, is not one;</HI> and if it be not, I will as freely ac∣knowledge there can be no such Thing. He desires the Attorney-General <HI>to favour them with some Stan∣dard Definition of a Libel, by which it may be cer∣tainly known whether a Writing be a Libel, yea, or not.</HI> And what is this for? Why truly to <HI>shorten the Dispute.</HI> But what Dispute does he speak of? The only Point that could admit of Dispute had been given up before by his confessing the Matters in Issue, and the Prosecutor's Witnesses, being there∣upon discharg'd. As to what he requires, either there was such a Definition to be met with in the Books, or there was not; if there was, he ought to have known it; if there was not, why should he desire Mr. Attorney to <HI>favour</HI> him with one? Yet after he had been indulg'd beyond Measure, and a Definition was produc'd from a good Author, who besides refers to several others that are unquestiona∣ble, all which conclude against his Client; is this loquatious Advocate contented? No. <HI>There are two Words to that Bargain,</HI> as he had said before. He makes it a Foundation for further Disputes, and ac∣cording to his wonted Ingenuity and Candour through∣out his <HI>Reverie</HI> calls the concurrent Sense of our Books, Mr. <HI>Attorney's Rule,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Attorney's Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P><Q>But what certain Standard Rule, <HI>quoth he,</HI> have the Books laid down, by which we can certainly know whether the Words are malicious? Whe∣ther they are defamatory? Whether they tend to a Breach of the Peace? And are a sufficient Ground to provoke a Man, his Family or Friends to Acts of Revenge? <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Now these Queries methinks do not so well become the Mouth of an Advocate as they might that of his Client, when abandon'd to his
<PB N="56" REF="011573_0029_0F8746BDDB62F4B0"/>
own Defence in a desperate Cause. But I answer, no Rules certainly can be of Use to those, who are de∣termin'd to act without any, or in Opposition to all Rules, in which Class our Northern Barrister must be plac'd, if we are to frame a Judgement of him from the Share he bore in this Tryal. The Rule laid down in our Books concerning <HI>Libels</HI> (I speak of Li∣bels in the strict Sense) according to the Definition of Mr. Serjeant <HI>Hawkins</HI> referr'd to in the Tryal, and which alone concerns the present Case, is founded on the Reason of the Thing; and is the same which is to be observed in other Matters that depend upon the Construction of Words and Writings, which are Signs only, or Images of Ideas intended to be conveyed to the Understandings of the Reader. There may in∣deed, be divers Rules apply'd according to the Cir∣cumstances of the Case, and this among the Rest, that where Words are capable of two Senses, the one faulty, the other innocent; the latter is to be taken, provided such a Construction may be made without violence to their natural Import and Meaning. From whence it will follow, that the same Cases may hap∣pen that are doubtful and do not come under any Standard Rule, on all which Occasions honest and upright Judges will incline to the favourable Side; there may be others again so clear and evident, that a Man must resign his Reason, or resolve to sacrifice his Conscience that does not discern, or will not allow them to be Libellous. But in none of these Cases can it come properly to be a Question before the Jury whether a Libel or not on the Plea of not Guilty, tho' it might afterwards be so, before the Court in Arrest of Judgement. By what has been said, there appears to be Latitude enough for a skilful Pen, (who not∣withstanding must do it at his Peril) to lash publick and private Vices, to caution the People against Mea∣sures that may be hurtful to them, or to remonstrate a∣gainst the evil Practices even of those in Power, without being always expos'd to the Penalties of the Law. Such a Liberty of writing and printing under

due Restrictions, I own <HI>Englishmen</HI> ought not, and I hope never will be depriv'd of, and where this is dex∣triously done, it would be ridiculous for private Per∣sons to put the Cap on their own Heads, and no less impolitick for those in high Stations to apply every Thing to their Administration. When such a Work is undertaken by able Hands, and with a generous View of serving the Publick, it is always laudable, and often very useful; but to succeed herein, requires a Capacity and Talents, not to be discovered in Mr. <HI>Zenger</HI>'s News-Papers, or his <HI>Council</HI>'s Speech.</P>
<P>I perceive my Letter is unawares run to a great Length, by the Quotations that are interspers'd, and which yet I am sensible is the least exceptionable Part of it. I shall therefore take Notice but of one Thing more in this matchless Harangue, which indeed ought not to be forgot, because it is made the Basis and Foundation of the whole; and that is concerning the <HI>Right of Freemen to complain when they are hurt.</HI> This our Lawyer often asserts in general Terms, with some Variation only of the Expression. As to which, I wou'd ask, whether by it he Means a Right to remon∣strate and complain in a legal Way, or a Right in all Cases to appeal to the People by seditious and scanda∣lous Libels? If the former, no Body ever deny'd it, and what he said was not <HI>ad idem;</HI> so that he was fighting with the Air, and quarrelling without an Ad∣versary. If the latter, he dishonour'd his Gown by ad∣vancing what is notoriously repugnant to all Laws human and divine. It was rul'd in the Court of <HI>B. R. Trin.</HI> 16. <HI>Car.</HI> That altho' a Bill be prefer'd in the Star-Chamber against a Judge for Corruption, or any other for any great Misdemeanour, yet if the Plain∣tiff will tell the Effect of his Bill in a Tavern, or any open Place, and by that Means scandalize the De∣fendant, the same is punishable in another Court. <HI>March Rep.</HI> 76, 77. So in the Case of <HI>Hole</HI> and <HI>Mellers,</HI> 28 <HI>Eliz.</HI> in <HI>C. B.</HI> it was said by the Court, that altho' the Queen is the Head and Fountain of Justice, and therefore it is lawful for all her Subjects
<PB N="58" REF="011573_0030_0F8746BE797C6670"/>
to resort unto her <HI>ad faciendum Querimoniam,</HI> yet if a Subject, after the Bill once exhibited, will divulge the Matter therein comprehended, to the Disgrace and Discredit of the Person intended, it is good Cause of Action, 3 <HI>Leon.</HI> 138. And to the same Purpose, in a much later Case, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Lake</HI> and <HI>King,</HI> reported in many of our Books, to which Mr. Ser∣jeant <HI>Hawkins</HI> refers, it seems agreed, as he observes, that whoever delivers a Paper full of Reflection on any Person in Nature of a Petition to a Committee of Parliament, to any other Person except the Members of Parliament, may be punished as the Publisher of a Libel, in Respect of such a dispersing thereof among those who have nothing to do with it. 1 <HI>Hawk.

<P>But our forward Barrister, <HI>aged and infirm</HI> as he represents himself (which compar'd with his Conduct is the keenest Satyr that could be suggested of him) ought to be further instructed, that even where Com∣plaints are to the King himself, they must be made in a proper and regular Manner, a Decency is to be ob∣serv'd, and a Regard always had to the Characters and Stations of the Persons against whom such Complaints are made. In 13 <HI>R.</HI> 2 <HI>Rot. Parliament,</HI> No. 45. The Commons desir'd they might not be troubled for any Matter that should be contained in Petitions to the King, and the King answer'd, let every Man complain, so it be with Law and Reason. <HI>It is law∣ful therefore,</HI> no doubt, as it has been resolv'd <HI>for any Subject to petition to the King for redress in an humble and modest Manner, where he finds himself aggrieved by a Sentence or Judgement; for access to the Sovereign must not be shut up in Case of the Subjects Distresses. But on the other Side, it is not permitted under Colour of a Pe∣tition and Refuge to the King to rail upon the Judge or his Sentence, and to make himself Judge in his own Cause by prejudging it before a Rehearing.</HI> Hob. 220. Yet Sir <HI>Rowland Flaxing</HI> was committed, and deeply fined for reporting to the King, that he could have no Indifferency before the Lords of the Council.

Sir <HI>Richard Terrets</HI> was committed, fined, sent to the Pil∣lory, and adjudged to lose both his Ears, for his slan∣derous Complaint exhibited to the King in a written Book against the Chief Justice <HI>Fitz-James.</HI> Which Cases are cited by Chief Justice <HI>Montague,</HI> in the Case of <HI>Wraynham,</HI> (who was severely punished for an Offence of the same Nature) as may be seen in the State Tryals, Vol. 7, P. 102. To these may be added, <HI>Jeffe</HI>'s Case in the King's-Bench, <HI>Mich.</HI> 5 <HI>Car. Jeffe</HI> was indicted for exhibiting an infamous Libel di∣rected to the King against Sir <HI>Edward Coke,</HI> late Chief Justice of the King's-Bench, and against the said Court, for a Judgement given in the said Court in the Case of <HI>Magdalen College,</HI> affirming the said Judge∣ment to be Treason, and calling him therein Traitor, perjur'd Judge, and scandalizing all the Professors of the Law. He fixed this Libel upon the great Gate at the Entrance of <HI>Westminster-Hall,</HI> and in divers other Places; and being hereupon arraign'd, pray'd that Counsel might be assign'd him, which was granted, and he had them, but would not be ruled to plead as they advised, but put in a scandalous Plea, and insist∣ing upon it, affirm'd he would not plead otherwise. Whereupon it was adjudg'd he should be committed to the Marshal, and that he should stand upon the Pillory at <HI>Westminster</HI> and <HI>Cheapside,</HI> with a Paper mentioning the Offence, and with such a Paper be brought to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Courts of <HI>Westminster,</HI> and to be continu'd in Prison, until he made his Submission in every Court, and that he should be bound with Sureties to be of good Beha∣viour during his Life, and pay a Thousand Pounds Fine to the King. <HI>Cro. Car.</HI> 175, 6.</P>
<P>What now shall we say, or what must be thought of one who while he pretends to great Reading and a tho∣rough Knowledge of these Things, could yet in the Face of a Court, and in Defiance of its Authority, and indeed of all Authority, presume to justify the Publi∣cation of the most audacious Libels against that very Government under which he was breathing the Sediti∣on! A Person, who as a Counsellor at Law, boasting at the same Time of <HI>having seen the Practice in very great Courts,</HI> would dare to call such Publication, ad∣dress'd to the People, <HI>The just Complaints of a Number

of Men who suffer under a bad Administration!</HI> Some of the Words charg'd in the Information, and which Mr. <HI>Hamilton</HI> offer'd to prove, are, <HI>That the Law was at an End.</HI> I can't tell what Proof he had to give of this Fact, but surely if <HI>his</HI> Doctrine were to prevail, it must soon be the Case; and for my own Part, I will confess, I have not hitherto heard of any Thing in that Pro∣vince, which look'd so much like it, as that such a Be∣haviour should not only go unpunish'd, but be attended with publick Munificence and Applause. The Truth is, this Gentleman, tho' styl'd a Barrister at Law in the Order of the Common Council of the City of <HI>New-York,</HI> and which Title therefore I have likewise given him; seems notwithstanding, instead of maintaining that Character, in the Tryal before us, to be rather possess'd with a Fit of <HI>Knight Errantry,</HI> and to have sally'd out from <HI>Philadelphia</HI> to the other Province, with a full Resolution to encounter every Thing that was Law, and to level all to the Ground that stood in his Way.—Let the Reader then be Judge upon the whole, whether he comes within the Description of that <HI>mis∣chievous Animal,</HI> I mention'd towards the Beginning of these Sheets.</P>
<P>After all, I flatter myself, it will not be imagined, that I was stimulated to these hasty Animadversions by a Principle of Envy to Mr. <HI>Hamilton,</HI> or any Disrespect to those who were pleased to patronize his Performance, since they are utter Strangers to me, and probably will ever remain so. On the contrary, they may be∣lieve me, when I declare, that if the One had really merited, what the Others were of Opinion he did, I should with much more Pleasure have signify'd my Ap∣probation of the Conduct of both, than I now take in shewing my Dislike. 'Tis on this Score, Mr. <HI>Keimer,</HI> that I cannot conclude, without publickly returning my Share of the Thanks, that are due from the <HI>Fra∣ternity</HI> to your late Correspondent, the polite Author of the <HI>Remarks,</HI> who has done Justice to the <HI>Bar</HI> by five Pap<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>, which in my humble Apprehension, are worthy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> any Gentleman <HI>at it,</HI> either here, or else whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>
