<L>But hark you, dear PAT, these words have their meaning,</L>
<L>To humble poor PADDY, and to keep him down,</L>
<L>But if ever we wish to be a FREE NATION,</L>
<L>UNION, sure PAT, is our only salvation—</L>
<L>On Patrick's day in the morning.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Such tythes and such taxes, with laws to opprese us,</L>
<L>In any wise nation, sure never was known;</L>
<L>Under placemen, with pensions, and their vile intentions—</L>
<L>The poor man and widow reluctant doth groan:</L>
<L>In bastiles and chains the true Patriot complains,</L>
<L>Their innocent lives they wish to betray;</L>
<L>Provldence will attend them, mankind will befriend them,</L>
<L>The virtuous and brave will ever commend them—</L>

<L>Long time they have prided to see us divided;</L>
<L>But now brightens up the happy new day,</L>
<L>When we with each other, like brother and brother,</L>
<L>With an IRISH SHILLELA these harpies will pay:</L>
<L>What think you dear PAT, can you guess what they're at?</L>
<L>They wish for to banish us out of the land;</L>

<L>The <HI>tocsin's</HI> sound did soon resound,</L>
<L>All ranks did fly to arms—</L>
<L>Both young and old, as I am told,</L>
<L>Not fearing war's alarms.</L>
<L>The hue and cry, <HI>'Live Free or die."</HI></L>

<HEAD>ARTHUR O'CONNOR's ADDRESS TO THE FREE ELECTORS of the COUNTY of ANTRIM.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Fellow-Citizens.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE POST-OFFICE is so immediately dependant on the Government, that any anonymous production issu∣ing from thence, must be looked on as coming from the Ad∣ministration itself; in this light I have viewed the anonymous paper which has been so industrously distrubuted through the Post Offices of the North, avowedly to deprive me of what∣ever share of your confidence I might have gained, and in this light I have given it an answer. Had I treated it with silent contempt, I should have hoped that its coming from an Administration which had so deservedly forfeited the confi∣dence of every Irishman who valued the liberties of his coun∣try, would have insured me from suffering, in your estima∣tion, from the falshood and calumny with which it abounds; but my respect for those invaluable Censors, the Press and the Public Opinion, the conscious integrity of my own heart, and the most perfect reliance on the virtue of the cause I espouse, prompt me to seize any occasion which affords an opportunity of vindicating it or myself from the aspersions of an Administration, whose heaviest charge, in their wretched production, is, that at any time of my life I had been the advocate of them or their measures. As the whole of the work is one continued issue of misrepresen∣tation and falshood, a plain recital of facts will be the best means of giving it a full refutation. After the question of Regency, that memorable display of the infamy and principles of the factions of Ireland, some of the most considerable of them were forced into IRISH PARLIA∣MENTARY, PATRIOTISM, by being stript of the wages of their prostitution, I accepted a seat from my uncle Lord Longueville, in the chimerical hope that this crash be∣tween
<PB N="39" REF="034290_0041_0FFD7DF4C15A0220"/>the factions and the Government, might be improv∣ed to the advantage of Ireland: but experience soon con∣vinced me that nothing short of the establishment of a NATIONAL GOVERNMENT, A TOTAL <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>NIHILATION OF THE FACTIONS, AND THEIR U<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>URPATIONS, AND AN, EN∣TIRE AB<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>TION OF RELIGIOUS DISTINCTIONS, could restore to my country those Rights, and that Liberty which had been so long a subject of traffic, under a regular or∣ganized system of treason, and acting up to this conviction from the day I accepted the seat from Lord Longueville, to the day I resigned it. I earnestly entreated him to de∣clare for a Reform of Parliament, and for the freedom of my Catholic countrymen. The thanks which were given me by the delegates of the Catholics of Ireland, for my defence of them and their cause, so early as 1791, and the vote which I gave for their total emancipation, against Lord Longueville and the Government, in the beginning of 1793, gives the lie to the assertion of Administration, that I was not the advocate of Catholic Freedom until my having spoke on that subject in 1795, and so wholly is it unfounded in truth, that I have exerted myself in defence of the liberties of my country, because the Go∣vernment refused me a Commissioner's place, that al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ho Lord Longueville repeatedly pressed me to let him procure me a Commissioner's place, I as often resused it, assuring him that it was contrary to my principles to accept the money of my impoverished countrymen, for the detestable treason of betraying their Rights, their Industry, their Manufactures and Commerce; that for the bribe of a British pander I shou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d base<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y contribute to aggrandize HIS country, at the ex∣pence of every thing dear to MY OWN; whilst so far from bartering my principles to better my fortune, that tho' Lord Longueville pressed me to accept large sums of his own mo∣ney, I declined them; and it is notorious he has since disin∣herited me for the open avowal of my political sentiments on the Catholic Question. Being forced, in my own vindi∣cation, to speak of myself, I will leave you my fellow citi∣zens, to judge of an Administration, that by fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>shood and calumny, have attempted to widen a breach between me and connections that were but too widely extended before; yet whilst they have given me an opportunity of proving to
<PB N="40" REF="034290_0042_0FFD7DE84145D228"/>you that no consideration could induce me to abandon my principles, they shall never succeed in making me utter one unkind expression of a man whose wishes to pro∣mote me in life, have left a grateful remembrance their malice shall never efface. Abandoned Adminstration! who have trampled on the liberties of my country, do you presume to accuse me of dissuading my courtrymen from arming to oppose an invasion, which YOUR'S AND YOUR ACCOMPLICE'S CRIMES HAVE PROVOKED? Is it that the unalienable rights of free-born men to make the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> laws by delegates of their choice, should be bartered and sold by usurpers and traitors, that I should presuade them to arm? Is it that our markets, our manufactures, and commerce, should be sold to that nation which appoints our Government, and dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>butes our patronage, that I should persuade them to arm? Is it to support the GUN∣POWDER BILL which deprives them of arms, or the CON∣VENTION BILL, which aims at perpetuating the usurpation of rights, by pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scribing the only obvious and orderly means to regain them, that I should persuade them to arm? Is it to support the suspension of the HABRUS CORPUS BILL, which has destroyed the bulwark of li∣berty by with-holding the TRIAL BY JURY, that I should persuade them to arm? Is it to rivet the bolts or to guard the dungeons of their fellow-citizeus, who, torn from their homes and their families by Administration, vainly demand that TRIAL BY JURY, which by proving their in∣nocence must establish its gui<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, that I should persuade them to arm? Is it that a vile pander of national ho∣nor and legislative duty should be invested with uncon∣trouled power over the opinions and persons of an injured, a gallant and generous people, that I should persuade them to arm? or to crown a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, is it under the auspic<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of the indemnified CARHAMPTON, I should persuade them to arm? Go, Impotents, to the Catho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ics, whose elevated hopes of all glorious freedom, you have been appointed to tauntingly blast and if they should charge you with the crimes of your miss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, although you cannot plead the having raised them to equal rights with their fellow-citizens, you can at least boast that you have levelled those rights to the standard of Catholic thraldom. Hence, then, contemptible Admi∣nistration,
<PB N="41" REF="034290_0043_0FFD7DE166C86010"/>from those you have insulted and levelled, to those you have raised; go to the monopolists of the representation of Ireland, and ask them to arm; go to those whom the continuance of the system of corruption enables to live in affluence at the expence of that poverty and misery their treason has caused, and ask them to arm; go to those hussars of fees and exactions in the revenue, whose regular pay bears no proportion to their pillage and plunder, and com∣mand them to arm; go to attorneys and lawyers, who live by villainy, chicane and fraud, under a system of complexity, finesse and fiction, at the expence and ruin of those who are forced to employ them, and tell them they ought to arm; go to those swarms of petty tyrants, perjured grand-jury jobbers, army contractors <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tythe proctors and land sharks, and tell them how necessary it is for them to be armed; go to the ESTABLISHED clergy, who pocket those monstrous funds for <HI>instructing</HI> nine-tenths of the nation, which should provide decent establishments for three such countries as Ireland, and tell them to preach to the nine-tenths who are excluded from this <HI>Glorious</HI> half of the con∣stitution, to arm in its defence, or ask them to blow the ex∣piring embers of re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>igious dessention, and I will leave it to the inhabitants of Armagh, at lenghth recovering from de∣lusion, to judge of their zeal in this christian-like duty. These factions, and Administration, are your natural a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ies; these are your strength; on these you may reckon, and although as devoted to systems which should be abolished, as apostates to national rights and national honor, they count but too high; thank Heaven they are as insignificant in num∣bers as in strength to those that are found. Although the old Volunteers have been discouraged, because they boldly threw off the open avowed dominion of Britans and that these Yeomen corpa have been raised to support the concealed deadly influence she has gained by corruption and treason; although the old Volunteers have been rejected because they extended the rights and liberties of their country, and that these corps have been set up to support la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s sub<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ersive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> both; yet when the systematic scheme of the British minister, and of those <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>in that have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>stied about the throne <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> fr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ms some new modelled des<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> of freedom, by the erecting of barracks, those bills that have been passed
<PB N="42" REF="034290_0044_0FFD7DD660D55988"/>year after year, the late contempt of that only privilege of the commons which was left them, the granting of money, and the correspondent conduct of their creatures in this coun∣try shall have been developed to that degree which would make resistance an indespensable duty, from my soul I be∣lieve that they would find themselves widely mistaken in the support they will meet from many of these corps they have raised. Are the people of Ireland so weak as to convert a threatened invasion from France into an expiation of the in∣justice, the crimes and oppression by which the temptation to make it was caused? or shall an invasion from France act like magic in changing the present ardent affection of the people of Ireland for liberty, into an unbounded display of loyalty to a system of corruption and treason, by which the most happily gifted nation on earth has been made to contain more misery than any country in the creation? Away with delusion! Are the people of Ireland sure that the factions and administra∣tion who so earnestly press them to arise to repel the invasion of France, are not <HI>Invaders themselves?</HI> Are we sure that their master maker, the Minister of Britain, has not invested them with enormous funds of corruption to which our wretched∣ness has been made to contribute. Are we sure that these funds have not been distributed amongst traitors, in the heart of our Island, for betraying the industry, manufactures and commerce of the people of Ireland, to aggrandize those of Great Britain? Nay, are we not certain that every market in Great Britain is shut against every species of Irish industry, with the solitary exception of linen, whilst every manu∣facture of England has free access to every market in Ireland, without any exception whatever? With these facts in our view, what Irishman can doubt that to support the worst of invasions, the invasion of <HI>Rights and of Commerce,</HI> 15,000 English and Scotch have not been sent to invade us already? or can we be certain that the shambles of Germany have not been resorted to, to invade us with more? Com∣pare the few troops they left us in the war against AME∣RICAN FREEDOM, when they had all Europe their foe, with the numbers they have sent us this war against the free∣dom of France, when they had all Europe their ally; com∣pare the weakness of Ireland, divided by religious dissention, <HI>when troops were so few,</HI> with that strength which UNION has given, when troops are so many; we cannot but see with
<PB N="43" REF="034290_0045_0FFD7E04F06ABAC8"/>whom they seek to contend. Could French invaders do worse than establish a system of pillage and treason <HI>within,</HI> that they may pillage and plunder <HI>without?</HI>—Could they do worse than reject laws a unanimous people had sought, or than pass those they detested; Could they do worse than commit the personal liberty of the people of Ireland to two men without connection or interest in the country, without responsibility or controul? Could they do worse than with∣hold trials from Irish citizens cast into dungeons, to the des∣truction of their health, and the ruin of their property? Cou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d they do worse than establish military Magistrates throughout the nation, and indemnify those whose unfeeling souls had torn hundreds of Irish citizens from every endearing connection in life, after depriving their habitations of every privilege due to the residence of free-born men, consigned them to the flames, turning their wives and children to beggary and famine, exiled their husbands to fight against that freedom which they had robbed them on an element they disliked, and in a cause they abhorred? or could any thing be more a∣larming to a people who valued liberty, than the appointment of a man, that could require such an indemnification, to be commander in chief of the army? or to crown all, could any invaders do worse, that with powers to legislate for a li∣mited time, under the form of constitutional order, destroy the constitution itself?</P>
<P>In vain shall the accomplices of the author of carnage inveigh against French fraternity, as long as Ireland exhi∣bits so melancholy a picture of the fraternity they have adopted themselves. I will not compare the systems of fraternity in East or West Indies, adopted by England and France, but I will compare the alliance which Eng∣land had formed with France, she calls her natural enemy, with that she dictates to Ireland, she calls her brother and friend.

Had she ceased to maintain power by the accur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed means of fomenting religious dissention; had she ceased to support factions, usurpers and traitors: had she abandoned the false il<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iberal notion, that she gained more by our depres∣sion than by our exaltation; had she treated us like bro∣thers and friends, I may, with confidence, affirm, a more affectionate generous ally never existed, that she would have found Ireland to her. But if the existing fraternity, my fellow citizens, be the bonds by which you wish a connection with Britain, I am not a delegate sit for your choice; for though I stood alone in the Commons of Ireland, I would move the repeal of every law which binds us to England, on those or on any such terms. I will neither be conquered by England or France; nor are we any more bound to a disadvantageous alliance to one than we are to the other; and before England, the factions of Ireland and the Administration. I speak it, If it is more the true interest of Ireland to form an alliance with France than with England, she is free to adopt it. The jargon of standing or falling with Britain is false; in the days that are past, we have always been DOWN— it is time we should seek to be UP! Rich in a population of 4,000,000 of a healthy intelligent people—rich in her fertile soil—rich in her harbours and navigable rivers— rich in her favourable position between the old and new worlds —rich in her insular situation, without usurping dominion over any people upon earth; what interest what cause, what pretext can the Administration of Ireland assign for the blood and the wealth they have lavished, in a war commenced in despotism, conducted in ignorance, and ending in ruin? With 800,000 gallant citizens, able to arm, the English and Scotch have more to fight for in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reland than the Irish themselves, that we cannot be trusted with self-defence? when in the unan∣ointed Republics of Swiss, they can defy the invasion of Ger∣many, of France, and Sardinia, those, warlike and powerful nations by which they are bounded by that law which obli∣ges every Citizen from 13 to 60 years old, to be provided <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, why cannot Ireland defy the whole world by a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> obligation?
