That I quit my poor Chloe, and stick to my glass;</L>
<L>But to you, men of reason my reasons I'll own;</L>
<L>And, if you don't like them, why—let them alone.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Altho' I have left her, the truth I'll declare:</L>
<L>I believe she was good, and I'm sure she was fair:</L>
<L>But goodness and charms in a bumper I see,</L>
<L>That makes it as good and as charming as she.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My Chloe had dimples and siniles, I must own:</L>
<L>But, tho' she could smile, yet in truth she could frown:</L>
<L>But tell me, ye lovers of liquor divine,</L>
<L>Did you e'er see a frown in a bumper of wine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Her lilies and roses were just in their prime;</L>
<L>Yet lilies and roses are conquer'd by time:</L>
<L>But in wine, from its age, such a benefit flows,</L>
<L>That we like it the better the older it grows.</L>

<L>They tell me, my love would in time have been cloy'd,</L>
<L>And that beauty's insipid when once 'tis enjoy'd:</L>

<L>For the longer I drink, the more thirsty am I.</L>

<L>Let murders, and battles, and bistory prove</L>
<L>The mischiefs that wait upon rivals in love:</L>
<L>But in drinking, thank heav'n, no rival contends:</L>

<L>Each change and excess hath through life been my doom,</L>

<L>When JACK no more on duty call'd,</L>

<L>Had strew'd with rigging all the deck;</L>

<L>I WAS press'd, while a rowing so happy—</L>
<L>No matter, 'twas childish to grieve;</L>
<L>So to drown care with grog I got a nappy,</L>
<L>Yet sigh'd my sweet Kitty to leave:</L>
<L>But what hurt me most were those ninnies,</L>
<L>On whom I had thought to depend,</L>

<L>When on board, why I troubled a ship mate</L>
<L>A note to my sweetheart to write;</L>

<L>So when I at Battersea landed,</L>

<L>When again on the salt seas in motion,</L>
<L>The ill-humour'd winds loudly roar;</L>
<L>And friendship I found on the ocean,</L>
<L>As scant as I left it on shore:</L>
<L>We were wreck'd—but my tale little matters,</L>
<L>While messmates to Davie descend,</L>
<L>I escap'd, but was poor, all in tatters,</L>
<L>And found I had got ne'er a friend.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet still to all fear I was a stranger,</L>
<L>In battle, (where death tips the grin)</L>
<L>Was expos'd to the heat of each danger,</L>
<L>Till a musket ball splinter'd my shin:</L>
<L>Well, away to the cock-pit I hobbled,</L>
