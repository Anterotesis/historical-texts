<Q><BIBL>Jeremiah xiv. 22.</BIBL>
<P>— <HI>Art not Thou He, O Lord our God? therefore we will wait upon Thee: for Thou hast made all these things.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HESE Words are the <HI>Close</HI> of the <HI>Chapter,</HI> and the <HI>first Verse</HI> of it informs us of the particular <HI>Occasion</HI> on which the whole was uttered: "<HI>The Word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the Dearth.</HI></P>
<P>The Dearth here spoken of was caus'd by a great <HI>Drought,</HI> but God can bring Dearth upon us as well by <HI>Cold</HI> and <HI>Clouds,</HI> as by burning Drought.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004130_0004_1003D237877BAE10"/>
The <HI>Prophet,</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Church,</HI> and from <HI>Love</HI> to it, humbly mourns, bewails, com∣plains, confesses, supplicates, deprecates, and expostulates; in Words the most moving and af∣fecting you ever read: See from the 19 <HI>Verse, "Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy Soul loathed Zion? why hast thou smitten us and there is no healing for us? we looked for Peace and there is no Good, and for the Time of healing and behold Trou∣ble! We acknowledge, O Lord, our Wickedness, and the Iniquity of our Fathers; for we have sinned a∣gainst thee. Do not abhor us for thy Name sake; do not disgrace the Throne of thy Glory; remember, break not thy Covenant with us: Are there any among the Vanities of the Gentiles that can cause Rain? or can the Heavens give Showers? "Art not Thou He, O Lord our god? therefore will we wait upon Thee, for Thou hast made all these Things."</HI></P>
<P>In these <HI>last</HI> Words the <HI>Prophet</HI> first <HI>despises,</HI> disdains, pours Contempt on, and rejects with Abhorrence the <HI>Gods</HI> of the <HI>Nations:</HI> "Are there any among the <HI>Vanities of the Gentiles</HI> that can give <HI>Rain?</HI> He gives to <HI>Idols</HI> their true Name <HI>Vanities;</HI> for we know that <HI>an Idol is nothing in the World.</HI> He affirms it universally, of <HI>all</HI> and every <HI>one</HI> of them, that they are but so many <HI>Vanities.</HI> He demands of them, if they can, on∣ly to give <HI>Rain:</HI> One of the <HI>greatest</HI> things, it is true, in Nature; yet one of the most <HI>common</HI> things too, and most necessary for Man. If they can't do <HI>this,</HI> what is there they can do for us? and if they could do this, what else might they not do?</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004130_0005_1003D23B9D31C528"/>
<HI>Secondly,</HI> He assigns to <HI>second Causes</HI> their Place and <HI>Limits; "Can the Heavens give Showers?</HI> either the <HI>upper</HI> or <HI>lower</HI> Heavens! As for the <HI>upper</HI> Heavens and all their <HI>Hosts,</HI> they are thus far concerned in our <HI>Rains,</HI> that the <HI>Sun</HI> exhales the Vapours by its fiery Rays, and the <HI>Moon</HI> in∣fluences our Waters both in the Air and Sea, and the Fluids in our Bodies, in a sensible but secret manner. And as for the <HI>lower</HI> Heavens, the Region of our <HI>Clouds,</HI> they gather not by any Knowledge or Design of their own, neither when they give their Showers do they mean a∣ny <HI>Benefit</HI> to us: For as <HI>Job</HI> said very piously and justly, "<HI>if I beheld the Sun when it shone!</HI> so must we say, if I behold the <HI>Rain</HI> when it falls, with any religious Respect to the <HI>Creature</HI> itself, it were to deny the GOD that is above.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> GOD the <HI>first Cause</HI> is devoutly ac∣knowledged in the <HI>Government</HI> of all second Cau∣ses, and in the <HI>Benefits</HI> done us by them; and all the <HI>Glory</HI> is render'd to <HI>Him</HI> alone, to Whom it is due: "<HI>Art not Thou He, O Lord our God? there∣fore we will wait on Thee; for Thou hast made all these Things.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. A <HI>Principle</HI> is laid down, in Form of <HI>Inter∣rogation,</HI> but in Sense a vehement <HI>Affirmation:</HI> Thou <HI>art</HI> He, and <HI>Thou</HI> only! Thou the Lord <HI>Jehovah,</HI> the God of Israel, thou only canst <HI>cause Rain,</HI> and command the <HI>Heavens</HI> to give us Showers! Thou dost it when and where thou pleasest, and thy Will and Providence governs herein! Who art <HI>greater</HI> than the Heavens and above them, hast made and rulest them.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="4" REF="004130_0006_1003D2440E53B598"/>
2. A devout <HI>Resolution</HI> is formed upon this <HI>Principle,</HI> a Resolution of <HI>Dependance</HI> on God and of <HI>Application</HI> to Him at all Times: "<HI>Therefore will we wait upon Thee,</HI> for <HI>thou hast made all these things:</HI> a good <HI>Reason</HI> for the Resolution; <HI>while the gods that made not the Earth and Heavens, let them perish from the Earth and from under these Heavens.</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>We will wait upon thee:</HI> should not <HI>a People</HI> wait on <HI>their God?</HI> They declare their Expecta∣tion to be only from Him, their Dependance to be solely on Him, and their Confidence to be strong in Him. They apply, and seek and pray, and <HI>resolve</HI> to continue herein, to Day, always and for evermore.</P>
<P>"<HI>For thou hast made all these things:</HI> the Earth, Waters, Air, Clouds, Seasons; and governest all for the Life and Good of Man. <Q>Thou hast given <HI>Being</HI> to all things, and thou givest <HI>Laws</HI> to them, and they serve the wise and gracious Intentions of thy <HI>Providence!</HI></Q> Thou <HI>with-holdest</HI> the Rain, or thou sendest it in <HI>Judgment</HI> or for <HI>Mercy!</HI> "Therefore <HI>we will</HI> wait upon Thee; rely on thee, seek to thee, tarry thy Time, be found in thy Way, and resign our Selves to thy Will.</P>
<P>The <HI>Doctrinal Observation</HI> from the Words might be this; "That the <HI>Supremacy,</HI> the uni∣versal <HI>Providence</HI> and Agency of the <HI>Lord our God,</HI> does strongly <HI>oblige</HI> us, and should engage and <HI>bind</HI> us, to be <HI>waiting</HI> upon Him at all <HI>Times</HI> and in every <HI>Case;</HI> more especially in our Times of <HI>Trouble,</HI> Straits and Difficulties.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="004130_0007_1003D24880BB35C8"/>
Or in the Words of <HI>Another,</HI> "The <HI>Sovereignty</HI> of God should engage, and his <HI>Asufficiency</HI> en∣courage our <HI>Attendance</HI> on Him, and our <HI>Expecta∣tions</HI> from Him at all <HI>Times."</HI></P>
<P>I shall only enquire into the <HI>Nature</HI> of this great <HI>Duty</HI> of Religion, our <HI>waiting</HI> on God; and then briefly suggest a few <HI>Reasons</HI> for it and <HI>Mo∣tives</HI> to it.</P>
<P N="1">I. The <HI>Duty</HI> of <HI>waiting</HI> on God implies and includes in it the following Things,</P>
<P N="1">1. Our fix'd <HI>Belief,</HI> our constant <HI>Remembrance,</HI> and actual <HI>Consideration</HI> of God, his <HI>Perfection</HI> and governing <HI>Providence,</HI> and the <HI>Extent</HI> of it to e∣very Thing in the World: that the <HI>Lord</HI> our <HI>God</HI> is <HI>one</HI> Lord, the <HI>living God</HI> and <HI>everlasting King,</HI> in Heaven above and on Earth below; and that <HI>we</HI> and all things are under his most wise, good, powerful and perfect <HI>Rule</HI> and Or∣dering; without <HI>which</HI> not a Cloud gathers o∣ver us, nor a Ray of the Sun shines on us, nor a Spire of Grass grows under our Feet. We must bear about with us always, wherever we are and whatsover we do, want and seek after, an abi∣ding Sense of our <HI>Dependance</HI> on God; who up∣holds all things by the Word of his Power, and the Eyes of all wait on Him; who holds <HI>our</HI> Soul in Life, feeds us every Day, and is <HI>our Life and the Length of our Days.</HI> Deut. xxx. 20.</P>
<P>This <HI>Belief in God</HI> is essentially requisite to, and necessarily supposed in, our waiting on Him: For he that cometh to God must believe that He is, and have right and just Apprehre∣sions of his blessed Nature and supream univer∣sal
<PB N="6" REF="004130_0008_1003D24DAEBD5500"/>Government; what He is <HI>in Himself</HI> and <HI>to us.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Consequently, we cannot <HI>wait</HI> upon God, but with a Frame of <HI>Worship</HI> and high <HI>Adoration.</HI> The <HI>idea</HI> of a great and good God commands <HI>this</HI> from us, all his <HI>Works</HI> challenge it, and every <HI>Benefit</HI> we look for from Him. They are all <HI>vast</HI> in themselves, and speak his <HI>Eternal Power and Godhead,</HI> and declare an Infinite Dominion, Wis∣dom, Goodness and Justice For Instance, Do we wait on God for the Light and <HI>Heat,</HI> or for the <HI>Shade</HI> and Moisture; it must be in such a Frame and Posture of Soul as that, Psalm cxxxv. 6, 7. <HI>For I know that the Lord is great, and that our God is above all Gods! Whatsoever the Lord pleased that did he in Heaven, and in Earth, in the Seas and in all deep Places: He causeth the Vapours to ascend from the Ends of the Earth, he maketh Lightnings for the Rain, he bringeth the Wind out of his Treasuries:</HI> And in the xxxiii Psalm; <HI>By the Word of the Lord were the Heavens made, and all the Host of them by the Breath of his Mouth; He gathereth the Waters of the Sea together as an heap, he layeth up the Depths in Store-houses; Let all the Earth fear the Lord, let all the Inhabitants of the World stand in Awe of Him!— Behold, the Eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope in his Mercy; to deliver their Soul from Death, and to keep them alive in Fa∣mine; Our Soul waiteth on the Lord, He is our Help and our Shield; for our Heart shall rejoice in Him, because we have trusted in his Holy Name: Let thy Mercy, O Lord, be upon us according as we hope in Thee.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="7" REF="004130_0009_1003D25A1EC76500"/>
3. We are in a more special and proper Sense <HI>waiting on God</HI> in the regular Discharge of the Duty of <HI>Prayer;</HI> serious constant and fervent Prayer to God for all we <HI>want.</HI> What Prayer or Supplication soever we make to God, mental or oral, private or public, we are therein wait∣ing upon God, lifting our Hearts and Eyes and Hands to Him; and He that searcheth the Heart knows the Mind of our Spirits. If we <HI>ask,</HI> and <HI>seek</HI> and <HI>knock,</HI> as our <HI>Lord</HI> directs us, Matth. vii. this to <HI>wait;</HI> but the prayerless Per∣son profanely neglects God, waits not on him in his <HI>Closet</HI> from Day to Day, nor <HI>watches at his Gates,</HI> the Gates of <HI>Zion,</HI> his House of <HI>Prayer</HI> to all People. — Our <HI>Text</HI> is it self a fervent holy <HI>Prayer</HI> to God, as the Governour of the <HI>Seasons,</HI> as the <HI>Father of the Rain.</HI> God expects to be thus acknowledged by us, to receive this <HI>Homage</HI> from us. Zech. x. 1. <HI>Ask of the Lord Rain,—and be will give Showers and Grass.</HI> And if we want the <HI>Shi∣ning of the Sun</HI> after the Rain, it is the same thing; we must seek and cry to God for it. And in these Cases the People of God are ready to <HI>pray,</HI> and enquire <HI>early</HI> after God; to <HI>howl</HI> to him for <HI>Corn and Wine and Oil,</HI> tho they do but <HI>flatter</HI> him with their Lips, and <HI>lie</HI> to him with their Tongues. Even the <HI>Priests of Baal</HI> in the Day of <HI>Drought</HI> waited on their <HI>deaf Idol,</HI> with loud <HI>Cries</HI> from Morning to Evening, to answer them either by <HI>Fire</HI> or <HI>Water; "O Baal hear us! Elijah</HI> made one loud and fervent <HI>Petition</HI> to the living God, and <HI>the Heavens gave Showers.</HI> — Generally, thro' the <HI>Book</HI> of God, the required <HI>Waiting on Him</HI> means Prayer and <HI>Supplications</HI> for Things agreable to his Will, and in a Manner</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="8" REF="004130_0010_1003B554AAFD0CF8"/>
4. We must <HI>wait</HI> upon God with <HI>upright Hearts,</HI> true and strong <HI>Desire</HI> of Soul to his Name, with <HI>Affection and Earnestness.</HI> The acceptable and <HI>effectual</HI> Prayer of the <HI>Righteous</HI> is the <HI>fervent</HI> one. St. <HI>James</HI> v. Cold and <HI>formal</HI> Praying is not meet to be called <HI>waiting</HI> on God. "<HI>Our Soul waiteth for the Lord;</HI> says the Psalmist, <HI>more than they that watch for the Morning:</HI> and he <HI>repeats the Profession</HI> to express the Truth and Vehemence of his Desire. The Dawn of the <HI>Morning-Light</HI> is not more earnestly <HI>long'd after</HI> by One in <HI>Pain</HI> on his bed thro' a long <HI>restless Night;</HI> than is the Favour and Mercy of God by a Soul that waits on Him therefor. "<HI>I wait for the Lord, my Soul doth wait, and I hope in his Word; Lord hear my Voice, and let thine Ear be attentive to my Supplica∣tions.</HI> Such are the Breathings of the earnest waiting Soul; "<HI>Lord all my Desire is before thee, and my Groaning is not hid from thee; with my Soul have I desired thee in the Night, and with my Spirit within me will I seek thee early.</HI> All the Powers and Affections of our Souls must be excited and engaged in our waiting on God.</P>
<P N="5">5. Humble and ardent <HI>Hope, Expectation, Trust</HI> and <HI>Confidence</HI> are implied in our <HI>waiting</HI> upon God. To <HI>wait</HI> on Him is to <HI>depend,</HI> rely, and expect from his Power and Goodness, accord∣ing to the <HI>promises</HI> of his Word. We are direct∣ed to <HI>ask in Faith,</HI> and are told that <HI>believing</HI> we receive. <HI>Abraham</HI> was <HI>strong</HI> in Faith, giving <HI>Glory</HI> to God; being <HI>fully</HI> perswaded that what he had <HI>promised</HI> he was <HI>able</HI> to persorm; and it was <HI>imputed</HI> unto him for Righteousness; as it is to Us also, if we <HI>believe</HI> on Him that raised up <HI>Jesus</HI> our Lord from the dead, Rom. iv. 20. God
<PB N="9" REF="004130_0011_1003D26CF3D02518"/>still remembers his <HI>holy Promises,</HI> and <HI>Abraham</HI> his Servant: i. e. the like <HI>Faith of his spiritual Seed</HI> in their Supplications to Him, and waiting on Him; and they, in their measure are made <HI>Kings and Priests</HI> to God, as <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> were in their Day; as <HI>Princes</HI> before the <HI>Throne</HI> have <HI>Power</HI> with their <HI>King</HI> and prevail.</P>
<P>In such a Spirit of Faith and <HI>Trust</HI> the Pro∣phet prays in our <HI>Context, "O the Hope of Israel, the Saviour of it in the Time of Trouble! Remember, break not thy Covenant! Do not abhor us for thy Name's sake, disgrace not the Throne of thy Glory! Art not Thou He, O Lord our God! Therefore we wait on thee.</HI></P>
<P>This is <HI>waiting</HI> and praying thro' the <HI>Psalms</HI> of <HI>David</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalms xxvii. 14, xxxiii. 20, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> lxii. 5. cxxx. 5.</NOTE>, <Q>My Soul, wait thou only upon God, for all my Expectation is from Him: He only is my Rock and my Salvation; He is my Defence and Glory, the Rock of my Strength and my Refuge is in God! <HI>Trust</HI> in Him at all Times ye People, pour out you Hearts before Him: Unto Thee O Lord, belongeth Mercy.</Q> <HI>Again,</HI> <Q>I had fainted unless I had <HI>believed</HI> to see the Goodness of God in the Land of the living; wait on the Lord, be of good Courage &amp; He shall strengthen thy Heart; wait I say on the Lord.</Q> <HI>Again,</HI> <Q>Our Soul waiteth on the Lord, He is our Strength and our Shield; for our Heart shall rejoice in Him, because we have trusted in his holy Name.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004130_0012_1003B55C2D24B3A0"/>
Thus there is no real <HI>praying,</HI> or <HI>waiting on God,</HI> without Faith, Hope &amp; Trust in some good Ex∣ercise; <Q><HI>I wait for the Lord, my Soul doth wait, and I hope in his Word.</HI></Q></P>
<P N="6">6. We must <HI>wait</HI> upon God with <HI>great Fear</HI> and <HI>holy Trembling,</HI> because of his <HI>Holiness, Justice</HI> and <HI>terrible Majesty.</HI> We must ever think of God, and bow before Him, as the <HI>great and dreadful God, who keepeth Covenant and Mercy;</HI> remembring our many and mighty <HI>Sins</HI> against Him, by which we have so often forfeited our daily Mercies, and highly merited his <HI>Wrath,</HI> that all the <HI>Vials</HI> of it should be poured out upon us, by <HI>Land</HI> and also on the <HI>Sea.</HI> So that should God order the <HI>Sun</HI> to withdraw it's <HI>Heat,</HI> and cover our Heavens with <HI>Clouds</HI> that our Prayers may not pass thro', it were less than our Sins deserve. Our <HI>Lives</HI> and Live∣lihood are every Day in his Hand, and should we not be afraid of <HI>the Power?</HI> A righteous, so∣vereign and judicial Power, <HI>Jer.</HI> v. 20.—24. <Q>De∣clare this in the House of <HI>Jacob,</HI> and publish it in <HI>Judah,</HI> saying, Hear now this, O foolish People and without Understanding, which have Eyes and see not, which have Ears and hear not! <HI>Fear ye not me,</HI> saith the Lord? will ye not <HI>tremble</HI> at my Presence, which have placed the Sand for the Bound of the Sea, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> Neither say they in their Heart, Let us now fear the Lord our God that giveth Rain, both the former and the latter in his Season; He reserveth unto us the appointed Weeks of the Harvest: Your Iniquities have turned away these things, and your Sins have witholden good things from you.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="004130_0013_1003D275CCC201A8"/>
<Q>O say unto GOD, how dreadful art thou in thy Works! He commands the <HI>Sun</HI> and it shines not, and he sealeth up the <HI>Stars:</HI> He bows his Heaven and comes down, and <HI>Dark∣ness</HI> is under his Feet: He makes it his secret Place, even dark Waters and thick Clouds of the Sky: Again, He commandeth the Clouds and they rain <HI>no Rain;</HI> Nor can there be either Dew or Rain from Year to Year but accord∣ing to <HI>his Word:</HI> He sends too the great and long Rains of his Strength and sets his Church, at least, a <HI>trembling:</HI> Let all the Earth <HI>fear</HI> the Lord, let all the Inhabitants of the World stand in <HI>Awe</HI> of Him
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Job ix. 7. Isai. v. 6. 1 Kings xvii. 1. Ezra x. 9. Psal. xviii. 9, 21.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P N="7">7. We must always <HI>wait</HI> on God with an <HI>en∣tire Resignation</HI> of <HI>our selves,</HI> and of <HI>all</HI> that con∣cerns us to his <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Sovereignty.</HI> His <HI>Will</HI> must be ours, which is the absolute Perfection of <HI>Spirits.</HI> The <HI>Angels of Light</HI> are thus <HI>waiting</HI> about the <HI>Throne</HI> on high, infinitely remov'd from <HI>Self-Denial.</HI> That belongs only to our State of of <HI>Sin,</HI> in the Punishments whereof our Obedi∣ence is <HI>Submission.</HI> Where the Psalmist profes∣seth, "Truly my Soul <HI>waiteth</HI> upon God; the <HI>Hebrew</HI> is—"My Soul is <HI>silent</HI> to God, or be∣fore Him. Not that it did not speak and pray, but because <Q><HI>it said nothing against what God did,</HI> but was <HI>quietly expecting what he would do,</HI> and resolved to acquiese therein.</Q>
<Q>This is the Way of <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Comfort,</HI> when we chearfully refer all our Affairs to the good Pleasure of
<PB N="12" REF="004130_0014_1003D27750F7B448"/>God, and accommodate our selves to his Dis∣pensations</Q> — The <HI>waiting</HI> Soul in a Time of Trouble, or doubting Expectation, prayes the <HI>more</HI> fervently; but it says, <HI>Father in Heaven thy Will be done; not as I will, but as thou will.</HI> "I will be <HI>still</HI> and know that it is God! Let the Lord do what seemeth good to him. So in the <HI>Way of God's Judgments we must wait on Him: He bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty City he layeth it low, even to the Ground; he bringeth it to the Dust,</HI> Isa. xxvi. 5, 8.</P>
<P N="8">8. We can <HI>wait</HI> on God only in the Way of <HI>Obedience,</HI> having Respect unto <HI>all</HI> his <HI>Command∣ments,</HI> and in a devout Observation of <HI>all</HI> his <HI>Ordinances.</HI> This is the royal and perfect <HI>Rule</HI> to us, and the sure Way of God's Blessing; "<HI>Wait on the Lord and keep his Way; Let Integrity and Uprightness preserve me, for I wait on thee. "All the Paths of the Lord are Mercy and Truth, unto such as keep his Covenant and his Testimonies. "Depart from Evil and do Good, and dwell for evermore.</HI> Sins of <HI>Omission</HI> as well as those of <HI>Commission,</HI> are a <HI>Departure</HI> from God: So are <HI>secret</HI> as well as <HI>open</HI> Sins; both against the <HI>first</HI> or <HI>second Table</HI> of the Law; any <HI>one</HI> Instance of allowed Sin; for he that offends in <HI>one</HI> point is guilty of all. Neither may we <HI>add</HI> unto the Word which the Lord our God has commanded us, nor <HI>diminish</HI> from it. We must <HI>take heed</HI> to our selves, and keep our Souls diligently, that we <HI>forget not</HI> any of the Statutes and Judgments so righteous, as <HI>all</HI> the Laws of our God; that they depart not from our <HI>Heart</HI> all the Days of our Life, but that we <HI>teach</HI> them to our <HI>Sons</HI> and their Children. Then God will be <HI>nigh to us</HI> in
<PB N="13" REF="004130_0015_1003D27E1AA44060"/>all that we <HI>call</HI> upon Him for. For therefore will the Lord <HI>wait</HI> that he may be <HI>gracious</HI> to us, and therefore will he be <HI>exalted</HI> in having <HI>Mer∣cy</HI> on us; for the Lord is a God of <HI>Judgment;</HI> and blessed are all they that <HI>wait</HI> for Him. <HI>Isai.</HI> xxx. 18.</P>
<P N="9">9. Using <HI>indirect Means</HI> to extricate our selves out of <HI>Evils</HI> real or imaginary, felt or fear'd, or using <HI>unlawful</HI> and <HI>wicked</HI> Means, is utterly in∣consistent with our <HI>waiting</HI> upon God.</P>
<P>Certainly God may bring us into <HI>Difficulties</HI> for our <HI>Trial,</HI> as he pleases. So he did by the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> who were dear to him, and for the most part they <HI>behav'd</HI> admirably, yet some∣times <HI>fail'd</HI> strangely. So did <HI>David</HI> in his <HI>lat∣ter</HI> Trials, after he had acted a more than <HI>royal</HI> Part in his <HI>first</HI> fiery Temptation, thro' the many Days of <HI>Saul's</HI> bloody and barbarous Per∣secution of him. And long after this, when <HI>Shi∣mei</HI> rav'd at him and curs'd him, he behav'd most <HI>piously,</HI> with a glorious <HI>Meekness</HI> and per∣fect <HI>Humility</HI> before God and Men. The <HI>Comfort</HI> hereof he carried to his <HI>Grave,</HI> and the <HI>Fame</HI> of it endures in the <HI>Church</HI> for ever. He gives God the <HI>Glory,</HI> and <HI>triumphs</HI> in the Remembrance of his <HI>Conquest</HI> over <HI>Himself</HI> and his <HI>Enemy,</HI> in the <HI>Eighteenth Psalm:</HI> He <HI>Sings</HI> there, <Q>How the Lord rewarded him according to his Righte∣ousness, according to the Cleaness of his Hands did he recompense him; for he had kept the Ways of the Lord, and had not wickedly de∣parted from his God; for all his Judgments were before him, and he did not put away his Statutes from him: Therefore the Lord re∣compensed him according to his Righteous∣ness,
<PB N="14" REF="004130_0016_1003D2822CD3DC50"/>according to the Cleaness of his Hands in his Eye-Sight: For with the merciful (says he) Thou wilt show thy self merciful, with an upright Man thou wilt shew thy self up∣right; with the pure thou wilt show thy self pure, and with the froward thou wilt show thy self froward: For thou wilt save the af∣flicted People, but wilt bring down high Looks; for thou wilt light my Candle, the Lord my God will enlighten my Darkness: As for God, his Way is perfect, the Word of the Lord is tried He is a Buckler to all that trust in Him.</Q></P>
<P>A <HI>People</HI> also are very prone, and more espe∣cially the <HI>Inferiour</HI> sort of People, to take <HI>indirect, rash</HI> and very sinful steps, provoking to <HI>God</HI> and injurious to their <HI>Rulers,</HI> rebellious against <HI>Pro∣vidence</HI> and humane <HI>Government,</HI> when for their <HI>Sins</HI> and Humiliation God brings them into <HI>Straits</HI> which it is not in the <HI>Power</HI> of Man it may be to <HI>deliver</HI> them out of, or at least not <HI>pre∣sently.</HI>—This was often the Case and Trans∣gression of the Children of <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wilder∣ness, under the Conduct of <HI>Moses</HI> the Man of God: As often almost as God bro't the <HI>Congrega∣tion</HI> into the Want of Bread or Water, or punish'd them for their past <HI>Murmurs</HI> and <HI>Mutinies,</HI> they fell into <HI>new</HI> and <HI>seditious Clamours,</HI> charging their <HI>Rulers</HI> with the most inimical Intenti∣ons toward them, even of <HI>destroying</HI> them &amp; their Children. You know the <HI>Ruin</HI> they brought on themselves hereby, we read their <HI>Sin</HI> in it's Pu∣nishment: <HI>Psal.</HI> xcv. Had they humbly, meekly and prayerful <HI>waited</HI> on God; believing, fearing, resigning and repenting; they had been timely extricated out of their pinching Straits, and led
<PB N="15" REF="004130_0017_1003D285B7AC8C58"/>directly to their Rest in <HI>Canaan:</HI> but they <HI>ran</HI> out of God's Way, and he <HI>left</HI> them to their own, and <HI>sware in his Wrath that they should never enter into his Rest.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. We must be <HI>waiting</HI> upon God in the Ex∣ercise of deep <HI>Repentance</HI> for our Sins against Him, and of lively <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>Name, Merits</HI> and <HI>Righ∣teousness of our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> for Pardon and Acceptance; and for the Bestowment of the <HI>least,</HI> even the most <HI>common</HI> outward <HI>Favours</HI> of Providence.</P>
<P>We can wait upon God only as <HI>Penitents,</HI> and by Faith in <HI>Christ.</HI> These <HI>two</HI> must always come together in every Prayer we make to God. The <HI>Prophet</HI> prayes in the Words before my <HI>Text,</HI> with great and holy <HI>Mourning</HI> for Sin, and with a strong <HI>Faith</HI> in the Covenant-Mercy of God! "<HI>We acknowledge, O Lord, our Wickedness, for we have sinned against thee; do not abhor us for thy Name sake, do not disgrace the Throne of thy Glory, break not thy Covenant,</HI> but <HI>remember</HI> it for us. The Throne of the <HI>Mediator</HI> is the Throne of God's <HI>Glory;</HI> He looks on <HI>that</HI> and remembers his Covenant-Mercy for penitent Sinners. All the Favours and <HI>Bounties</HI> of God in the Course of his Providence come to us for the <HI>sake</HI> of Christ. The Kingdom of <HI>Providence</HI> is in <HI>his</HI> Hand, even the whole Administration of it, for the Good of his Church and the World. It is for <HI>His</HI> sake that the World stands. In his <HI>Sa∣crifice</HI> it is that <HI>God smells the sweet savour,</HI> as in the Day of <HI>Noah</HI> whose Offering of <HI>every</HI> clean Kind was but the <HI>Type</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>one</HI> Offering; and the <HI>Curse</HI> is no more executed on the Earth till the <HI>Conflagration</HI> to which it is reserved.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="004130_0018_1003D29289838048"/>
We pray to God only in the <HI>Name</HI> of his Son Jesus Christ, by <HI>Faith</HI> in his Mediation and In∣tercession, and in the <HI>Promises,</HI> which are all in Him <HI>Yea</HI> and <HI>Amen:</HI> We look for <HI>his</HI> Mercy, whe∣ther it be on temporal Accounts or spiritual. We have no <HI>Access</HI> unto the <HI>Father</HI> but by Him. On <HI>his</HI> Name therefore it is we wait, who has <HI>purchas'd</HI> for us all we need for Soul and Body, and by his Hand it is bestowed on us. It is <HI>good before his Saints</HI> to receive all of Him and thro' Him; to whom be Glory for ever.</P>
<P N="11">11. We must <HI>wait</HI> on God with <HI>Patience and Constancy, Continuance</HI> and <HI>Perseverance.</HI> We must continue in Faith, Prayer, Hope, Trust, Resig∣nation, Repentance and universal Obedience. This is <HI>waiting.</HI> Psal. xxv. 5. <HI>On Thee do I wait all the Day.</HI> All the <HI>Days</HI> of our Life, this is our Work, every Day the Work of the Day. Psal. xxxvii. 7. <HI>Rest in the Lord and wait patiently for him.</HI> It is good for a Man to hope and <HI>quietly wait</HI> for the Salvation of God. We must wait <HI>God's Time</HI> as well as <HI>keep his Way:</HI> The <HI>Vision</HI> has its ap∣pointed Time, if it <HI>tarry</HI> wait for it; it will surely <HI>come</HI> and not tarry. We must not be <HI>short-spirited.</HI> The Rule and Precept to us is, <HI>Patient in Tribulation, continuing instant in Prayer, and re∣joicing in Hope.</HI> There is no practical Religion and Godliness without <HI>a patient Continuance in Well-doing.</HI> Patience must have its <HI>perfect Work,</HI> whether it be in <HI>bearing</HI> and submitting, or in praying and <HI>obeying.</HI> Waiting respects both the <HI>active</HI> and <HI>passive</HI> Exercise of Grace. "<HI>The Fool∣ishness of Man perverteth his Way, and his Heart fretteth against the Lord.</HI> As the profane and impa∣tient King said, "<HI>This Evil is of the Lord, why
<PB N="17" REF="004130_0019_1003D2965D2691F8"/>should I wait on the Lord any longer?</HI> and into what desperate <HI>Outrages</HI> was he running against the best <HI>Friend</HI> and <HI>Father</HI> among the Israel of God? 2 <HI>Kings</HI> vi. 31.</P>
<P N="12">12. And lastly, We must <HI>wait</HI> upon God with <HI>Resolution</HI> and <HI>holy Fortitude,</HI> in the <HI>Strength</HI> of God. Without Him we can <HI>do nothing,</HI> nor may presume to <HI>resolve</HI> on any thing; but the least Believer may say, "<HI>I can do all things thro' Christ helping me.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Prophet</HI> forms a mighty, just and reasona∣ble <HI>Resolution</HI> in my <HI>Text; "Therefore we will wait upon Thee.</HI> We must <HI>resolve</HI> to <HI>wait</HI> upon God, and resolutely <HI>set</HI> our selves to do it. There needs a good and strong <HI>Resolution</HI> to perform this Du∣ty. Who ever did any thing great and good, without a Firmness and Constancy of Soul in undertaking it? <HI>It is a good Thing that the Heart be established with Grace;</HI> to be able to say with the <HI>Psalmist, "My Heart is fixed, O God, my Heart is fixed.</HI> This is the <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Property</HI> of a Saint in every point of Duty. His Heart is fixed in this especially, to be <HI>waiting</HI> on his God continually. <HI>Grace</HI> has thus wro't in the Saints of every <HI>Age,</HI> Psal. lii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>I will wait on thy Name, for it is good before thy Saints.</HI> Here's Inclination and Resolu∣tion, and a good <HI>Reason</HI> for it, Isai. viii. 17. <HI>I will wait upon the Lord who hideth himself from the House of Israel, and will look for Him.</HI> Micah vii. 7. <HI>Therefore I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my Salvation; my God will hear me.</HI> How positively do they resolve, one and another of them, as Men determined and fixed thro' Grace; "<HI>I will, I will?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="004130_0020_1003D2A0B2826F68"/>
To <HI>resolve</HI> is a rational Act of the humane Soul, whereby it freely and firmly determines and <HI>binds</HI> it self to <HI>do,</HI> that which it judges to be it's Duty, Wisdom and Interest. But consi∣dered as an Act of <HI>Religion,</HI> it supposes a Mind divinely <HI>illuminated</HI> from the Word of God, un∣der the Influence and Power of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> with a full Purpose of Heart determined for a holy Life. Josh. xxiv. 27. <HI>Nay, but the Lord our God we will serve, and his Voice we will obey.</HI></P>
<P>This is a very <HI>serious</HI> and <HI>awful</HI> thing, and must be done with Understanding and <HI>Know∣ledge,</HI> with Deliberateness and <HI>Consideration,</HI> fer∣vently and <HI>zealously,</HI> for <HI>without Counsel Purposes are disappointed.</HI> To use the Apostle's Words, it must be done devoutly and with Solemnity: 2 Cor. i. 17. <HI>When I therefore was thus minded, did I use Lightness? or the Things that I purpose, do I purpose according to the Flesh? that with me there should be Yea, Yea, or Nay, Nay! As God is true our Word was not Yea and Nay.</HI> Religion is founded on certain and <HI>unchangeable</HI> Principles and Re∣solutions, and there must be no saying and un∣saying, promising and changing in it. But then neither may we make any religious Resolutions in <HI>our own</HI> Strength, but with an entire <HI>Depen∣dence</HI> on the Grace of God, which <HI>worketh in us both to will and to do.</HI> We must be very <HI>humble</HI> if we wou'd be strong, and have a <HI>godly Jealousy</HI> of our selves, that our Hope may be in God. Psal. cxix. 8. <HI>I will keep thy Statutes, O forsake me not.</HI> We must also resolve upon the <HI>Means,</HI> to∣gether with the <HI>End;</HI> and <HI>up and be doing that the Lord may be with us.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="004130_0021_1003D2A70CE719C0"/>
And thus I have spoken of the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Duty, what it is for us <HI>to wait upon God.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I come briefly to mention a few <HI>Reasons, Motives</HI> and <HI>Arguments,</HI> for our resolving on and engaging in this Duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. God is <HI>great</HI> and it is <HI>meet</HI> we should wait on Him. <HI>Kings</HI> and <HI>Princes</HI> expect much wait∣ing on them. It is the <HI>least</HI> Homage to the <HI>King Eternal,</HI> Immortal, the blessed and only Poten∣tate. Should we not daily attend his <HI>Levee?</HI> not in Ceremony and Compliment, or for any Need of our Services, but to express a sincere Loyalty and humble <HI>Allegiance,</HI> and to acknowledge an absolute Subjection and Dependance. Zeph. iii. 8. <HI>Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the Lord, until the Day that I rise up.</HI> Luke xii. 36. <HI>And be ye your selves like unto Men that wait for their Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The Favour, <HI>Gifts and Bounties of a God</HI> are well <HI>worth</HI> our waiting for. Instance if you please in the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Rain</HI> from Heaven, do they not <HI>deserve</HI> more than all the Pains that we can be at in our Dependance on God, or Supplications to Him? Do they not <HI>pay</HI> us well for our repea∣ted urging Prayers? Doth not the <HI>Husbandman</HI> wait for them <HI>with long Patience,</HI> after much Toil and Labour, that he may receive the Fruits of the Earth? <HI>James</HI> v. 7. And when he has reap'd a good <HI>Harvest,</HI> thinks himself well recompens'd for his Summer's Work! But how great and good are the Blessings of <HI>Grace,</HI> which our God especially requires us to be waiting on him for! Luke xii. 23: <HI>It is your Fathers good Pleasure to give you the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="20" REF="004130_0022_1003D2B199B22FA0"/>
3. All things <HI>wait</HI> upon God, and he is glo∣rified in them. In this <HI>Way</HI> it is that we give him <HI>Honour,</HI> and do him <HI>Glory.</HI> So we acknow∣ledge his Power, Goodness and Sovereignty, and testify our Dependance on Him, Subjection to Him, and Receipts from Him. Psal. cxxiii. 2. <HI>Behold, as the Eyes of Servants look unto the Hand of their Masters, and as the Eyes of a Maiden unto the Hand of her Mistress; so our Eyes wait upon the Lord our God, until that he have Mercy upon us.</HI> We wait as <HI>Beggars</HI> for an Alms, as <HI>Children</HI> for a Father's Regard and Blessing, and as <HI>Subjects</HI> on their Prince for his Favour and Reward, and at the same Time to know his Pleasure and do his Will. Psal. lix. 9. <HI>Because of his Strength will I wait on thee, the God of my Mercy shall prevent me.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. It is <HI>highly profitable and beneficial to us</HI> to be waiting upon God. "<HI>A Servant that waiteth on his Master shall be honoured.</HI> We do not serve God <HI>for nought.</HI> It is <HI>good</HI> for a Man to hope and <HI>quietly wait;</HI> Good in it self, good in us, good for us; <HI>good before his Saints,</HI> good in their Account, good in their Experience as well as Conscience, Psal. xxv. 3. <HI>O my God I trust in thee, let me not be ashamed.</HI> Isai. xxxiii. 2. <HI>O Lord be gra∣cious to us, for we have waited on thee.</HI> As <HI>Kings</HI> distribute Riches and Honours among them that wait in their Presence, so doth the <HI>King of Hea∣ven</HI> the Blessings of his Providence and Grace here, and all spiritual Blessings in heavenly Pla∣ces, among them that religiously wait on and serve Him.</P>
<P>Let what has been said <HI>reprove</HI> those among us, who are <HI>irreligious</HI> and <HI>prayerless,</HI> and so far
<PB N="21" REF="004130_0023_1003D2B8267638D0"/>from <HI>waiting</HI> on God in <HI>this Day of Trouble and Rebuke,</HI> on private and personal Accounts as well as publick; that they are indeed <HI>murmur∣ing</HI> against Him in their <HI>Hearts</HI> and with their <HI>Mouths,</HI> and <HI>mutinying</HI> against him with their <HI>Hands,</HI> in open Defiance of that <HI>Government</HI> which God has set over them. These things bring great <HI>Guilt</HI> upon a People, and should be matter of <HI>Mourning</HI> and great <HI>Humiliation</HI> to us; they are greatly to be <HI>repented</HI> of and openly <HI>testified</HI> against. Psal. xii. 4. <HI>Who have said, with our Tongues will we prevail, our Lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</HI> We cry out of <HI>Wrongs,</HI> and of <HI>Oppression,</HI> we cry <HI>to Men</HI> and <HI>against</HI> one ano∣ther, and we cry against <HI>Those</HI> (it may be) who <HI>never</HI> wrong'd us, but are publick <HI>Benefactors;</HI> but we cry not to <HI>God</HI> that binds us, to <HI>whom</HI> we shou'd cry out against our <HI>selves</HI> and our own <HI>Sins:</HI> we do not <HI>wait upon Him</HI> with our Secret and Publick mournful <HI>Prayers</HI> for our Families and our People.</P>
<P>To <HI>this</HI> let us be humbly <HI>directed</HI> and <HI>exhorted</HI> in the <HI>Fear</HI> of God; to carry all our <HI>Difficulties</HI> to God, sensible of his punishing <HI>Hand</HI> in them, and <HI>humble</HI> our selves under it. Job xxi 4. <HI>Is my Complaint to Man? If it were so, why should not my Spirit be troubled?</HI> x. 1, 2 <HI>I will leave my Com∣plaint upon my self, I will say unto God do not con∣demn me.</HI> <Q>God will <HI>hear</HI> the Desire of the <HI>Humble,</HI> he <HI>prepares</HI> their Heart and <HI>bows</HI> his Ear. <HI>Cursed</HI> is the Man, that trusteth in <HI>Man,</HI> and maketh <HI>Flesh</HI> his Arm, and whose Heart departeth from the <HI>Lord;</HI> But <HI>blessed</HI> is the Man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose <HI>Hope</HI> the Lord is: the <HI>One</HI> shall not see when
<PB N="22" REF="004130_0024_1003D2C1159E7838"/><HI>Good</HI> cometh, nor the other when <HI>Heat</HI> com∣eth.</Q></P>
<P>But let us especially be waiting on God for the <HI>spiritual Blessing,</HI> the Blessings of his <HI>Grace,</HI> for the Effusion of his <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> for broken and <HI>contrite Hearts,</HI> and for the <HI>Pardon</HI> of our Sins. <Q>Seek <HI>first</HI> the Kingdom of God and his Righ∣teousness, and all <HI>other</HI> Things shall be added to us, by our <HI>Heavenly Father,</HI> who knows our Need of them.</Q> Our anxious <HI>Fore-tho't,</HI> distracting <HI>Cares</HI> and immoderate <HI>Fears,</HI> are our Misery and Crime. We need the Spirit of Humiliation and <HI>Repentance,</HI> of Prayer and <HI>Re∣formation,</HI> more than the very <HI>Light,</HI> or <HI>Rains</HI> of Heaven. We need to care for our <HI>Souls,</HI> more than for our Bodies; that <HI>these</HI> may feed and flourish under the Word of Life: This <HI>Blessing</HI> is more than the <HI>Dew of Heaven, the Fatness of the Earth, or Plenty of Corn and Wine.</HI> O if the <HI>Lord</HI> would make <HI>his Face to shine upon his San∣ctuaries,</HI> in the Efficacy of his Word and the Conversion of Souls! This is the <HI>Consolation</HI> we should be waiting for in the <HI>Temple!</HI> these the richer <HI>Dews of Hermon</HI> descending on the <HI>Moun∣tains of Zion,</HI> where the Lord commands the Blessing, even <HI>Life for evermore.</HI></P>
<P>Let us wait on God in all his <HI>Ordinances</HI> that his <HI>Doctrine</HI> may drop as the <HI>Rain,</HI> and the <HI>Light</HI> of the Knowledge of his Glory <HI>shine into our Hearts</HI> by and with his <HI>Word.</HI> Let us lift up our Eyes and Hearts to <HI>Him</HI> that is above the Hea∣vens, and pray — "<HI>Drop down ye Heavens from above, ond let the Skies pour down Righteous∣ness!</HI> It follows, <Q>Let the Earth open and let
<PB N="23" REF="004130_0025_1003D2C902375A30"/>them bring forth <HI>Salvation,</HI> and let Righte∣ousness spring up together: I the <HI>Lord</HI> have created it! Wo unto him that striveth with his <HI>Maker;</HI> let the <HI>Potsherd</HI> strive with the Potsherds of the Earth; shall the <HI>Clay</HI> say to Him that fashions it, <HI>what makest thou?</HI></Q> <HI>Men</HI> are but broken <HI>Potsherds</HI> (says <HI>One</HI> on the Place) and are often made so by their <HI>mutual Contentions,</HI> dashed <HI>in pieces</HI> one against another.</P>
<P>What faith the <HI>Apostle?</HI> Galat. v. 5. <HI>We thro' the Spirit wait for the Hope of Righteousness by Faith.</HI> There is nothing worthy of a <HI>Christians</HI> waiting for like <HI>this;</HI> nothing in Comparison of it. It is highly <HI>pleasing</HI> to God to see us waiting on him for this, and his <HI>Promise</HI> is full on this point, Luke xi. 13. <HI>Shall not your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask Him?</HI> This Bles∣sing of Blessings is the <HI>Hope</HI> of Believers, and it is <HI>the Hope of Righteousness;</HI> the <HI>Promise of the Father</HI> which <HI>Christ</HI> left with his <HI>Apostles</HI> in his <HI>Farewell Discourse</HI> with them: <Q>who when He should come would <HI>convince the World of Sin, of Righteousness and of Judgment:</HI></Q> A <HI>Hope</HI> foun∣ded on the <HI>Righteousness of Christ,</HI> sanctifying to us and keeping us in the Ways of Righteous∣ness. <HI>Faith in Christ</HI> allows us not to <HI>hope</HI> on any other <HI>Ground,</HI> nor in any other <HI>Way,</HI> but warrants us in <HI>this.</HI> And it is <HI>thro' the Spirit,</HI> un∣der <HI>his</HI> Direction and Influence, that we are <HI>be∣gotten</HI> unto the lively <HI>Hope,</HI> and are kept <HI>waiting</HI> for it. And they that <HI>thus</HI> wait upon God, that wait on Him <HI>for this,</HI> shall never be <HI>ashamed of their Hope.</HI></P>
