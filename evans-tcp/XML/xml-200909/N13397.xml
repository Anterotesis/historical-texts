<HEAD>THE CRISIS EXTRAORDINARY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is impossible to sit down and think seriously on the af∣fairs of America, but the original principles on which she resisted, and the glow and ardor they inspired, will occur like the undefaced remembrance of a lovely scene. To trace over in imagination the purity of the cause, the volun∣tary sacrifices made to support it, and all the various turnings of the war <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> its defence, is at once both paying and receiving respect. The principles deserve to be remembered, and to re∣member them <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ghtly is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. In this indulgence of generous recollection we <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> by what we seem to give, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> we become,</P>
<P>So extensively right was <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which America pro∣ceeded, that it not only took in every <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and liberal senti∣ment which could impress the heart, but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> interest of every class and order of men to defend the country. The war, on the part of Britain, was originally a war of co∣vetousness. The sordid and not the splendid passions gave it being. The fertile fields and prosperous infancy of America appeared to her as mines for tributary wealth. She viewed the hive, and disregarding the industry that had enriched it, thirsted for the honey. But in the present stage of her affairs, the violence of temper is added to the rage of avarice; and therefore, that which, at our first setting out, proceeded from purity of principle and public interest, is now heightened by all the obligations of necessity; for it requires but little know∣ledge of human nature to discern what would be the conse∣quence, were America again reduced to the subjection of Bri∣tain. Uncontrouled power, in the hands of an incensed, im∣perious and apacious conqueror, is an engine of dreadful exe∣cution▪ and woe be to that country over which it can be ex∣ercised. The names of Whig and Tory would them be sunk in the general term of Rebel, and the oppression, whatever it might be, would, with very few instances of exception, light equally on all.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="016919_0002_0F9EC8B8CC41C1A0"/>Britain did not go to war with America for the sake of domi∣nion, because she was then in possession; neither was it for the extension of trade and commerce, because she had monopolized the whole and the country had yielded to it; neither was it to extinguish what <HI>she</HI> might call rebellion, because before she began no resistence existed. It could then be from no other motive than avarice, or a design of establishing, in the first instance, the same taxes in America as are paid in England (which, as I shall presently show, are above eleven times heavier than the taxes we now pay for the present year 1780) or, in the second instance, to confiscate the whole property of America, in case of resistance and conquest, of the latter of which she had then no doubt.</P>
<P>I shall now proceed to <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ow what the taxes in England are, and what the yearly expence of the present war is to her— What the taxes of this country amount to, and what the an∣nual expence of defending it effectually will be to us; and shall endeavor concisely to point out the cause of our difficul∣ties, and the advantages on one side, or the consequences on the other, in case we do, or do not, put ourselves in an effec∣tual state of defence. I mean to be open, candid and sincere. I see a universal wish to expel the enemy from the country, a murmuring because the war is not <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> on with more vigour, and my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> is to show as shortly as possible both the reason <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</P>
<P>The number <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> souls in England (exclusive of Scotland and Ireland) is seven millions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This is taking the highest number that the people of England have been or can be rated at.</NOTE>, and the number of souls in Ame∣rica is three millions.</P>
<P>The amount of the taxes in England (exclusive of Scot∣land and Ireland) was, before the present war commenced, eleven millions six hundred and forty two thousand six hun∣dred and fifty three pounds sterling, which on an average is no less a sum than one pound thirteen shillings and threepence ster∣ling per head per annum men, women, and children; besides county taxes, taxes for the support of the poor, and a tenth of all the produce of the earth for the support of the bishops and clergy <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>The following is taken from Dr. Price's state of the taxes of England, pages 96, 97, 98.</P>

to pay the interest of the national debt contracted by former wars, and the remaining sum of six millions six hundred and forty two thousand six hundred pounds was applied to defray the yearly expence of government, the peace establishment of the army and navy, placemen pensioners, &amp;c. consequently the whole of her enormous taxes being thus appropriated, she had nothing to spare out of them towards defraying the ex∣pences of the present war or any other. Yet had she not been in debt at the beginning of the war at we were not, and like us had only a land and not a naval war to carry on, her then revenue of eleven millions and a half pounds sterling would defray all her annual expences of war and government within each year.</P>
<P>But this not being the case with her, she is obliged to bor∣row about ten million pounds sterling yearly, to prosecute the war she is now engaged in (this year she borrowed twelve) and lay on new taxes to discharge the interest; and allowing that the present war has cost her only fifty millions sterling, the interest thereon at five per cent. will be two millions and an half, therefore the amount of her taxes now must be fourteen millions, which on an average is no less than forty shil∣lings sterling per head, men, women and children through∣out
<PB N="4" REF="016919_0004_0F9EC8BB8E75DBC8"/>
the nation. Now as this expence of fifty millions was borrowed on the hopes of conquering America, and as it was avarice which first induced her to commence the war, how truly wretched and deplorable would the condition of this country be, were she, by own remissness, to suffer an enemy of such a disposition, and so circumstanced, to reduce her to subjection.</P>
<P>I now proceed to the revenues of America.</P>
<P>I have already stated the number of souls in America to be three millions, and by a calculation I have made, which I have every reason to believe is sufficiently right, the whole ex∣pence of the war, and the support of the several governments, may be defrayed for two million pounds sterling, annually; which, on an average, is thirteen shillings and four pence per head, men, women and children, and the peace establishment at the end of the war will be but three quarters of a million, or five shillings sterling per head. Now throwing out of the question every thing of honor, principle, happiness, freedom, and reputation in the world, and taking it up on the simple ground of interest, I put the following case.</P>
<P>Suppose Britain was to conquer America, and as conquer∣ors was to lay her under no other conditions than to pay the same proportions toward her annual revenue which the people of England pay; our share, in that case, would be six mil∣lion pounds sterling yearly; can it then be a question, whe∣ther it is best to raise two millions to defend the country, and govern it ourselves, and only three quarters of a million af∣terwards, or pay six millions to have it conquered, and let the enemy govern it.</P>
<P>Can it be supposed that conquerors would chuse to put them∣selves in a worse condition than what they granted to the con∣quered. In England, the tax on rum is five shillings and one penny sterling per gallon, which is one silver dollar and four∣teen coppers. Now would it not be laughable to imagine, that after the expence they have been at, they would let either Whig or Tory in America drink it cheaper than themselves. Coffee which is so considerable an article of consumption and support here is there loaded with a duty, which makes the price between five and six shillings sterling a pound, and a penalty of fifty pounds sterling on any person detected in roasting it in his own house. There is scarce an article of life you can eat, drink, wear, or enjoy that is not there loaded with a tax; even the light from heaven is only permitted to shine into their dwellings by paying eighteen pence sterling per window annually; and the humblest drink of life, small beer, can∣not there be purchased without a tax of nearly two coppers
<PB N="5" REF="016919_0005_0F9EC8BC510AD6B8"/>
a gallon, besides a heavy tax upon the malt, and another on the hops before it is brewed, exclusive of a land tax on the earth which produces them. In short, the condition of that country in point of taxation is so oppressive, the number of her poor so great, and the extravagance and rapaciousness of the court so enormous, that were they to effect a conquest of America, it is then only that the distresses of America would begin. Neither would it signify any thing to a man whether he be what we call a Whig or a Tory. The people of Eng∣land and the ministry of that country know us by no such distinctions. What they want is clear solid revenue, and the modes they would take to procure it, would operate alike on all. Their manner of reasoning would be short, because they would naturally infer that if we were able to carry on a war of five or six years against them, we are able to pay the same taxes which they do.</P>
<P>I have already stated that the expence of conducting the present war, and the government of the several states, may be done for two millions sterling, and the establishment in time of peace, for three quarters of a million <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">I have made the calculations in sterling, because it is a rate generally known in all the states, and because likewise it admits of an easy comparison between our expen∣ces to support the war and those of the enemy. Four silver dollars and an half is one pound sterling and threepence over.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As to navy matters, they flourish so well, and are so well attended to, in the hands of individuals, that I think it con∣sistent on every principle of real use and oeconomy, to turn the navy into hard money (keeping only three or four pack∣et▪) and apply it to promote the service of the army. We shall not have a ship the less; the use of them, and the benefit from them, will be greatly increased, and their expences saved. We are now allied with a formidable naval power, from whom we derive the assistance of a navy. And the line in which we can prosecute the war, so as to reduce the common enemy and benefit the alliance most effectually, will be by attending closely to the land service.</P>
<P>I estimate the charge of keeping up and maintaining an ar∣my, officering them, and all expences included, sufficient for the defence of the country, to be equal to the expence of forty thousand men at thirty pounds sterling per head, which is one million two hundred thousand pounds.</P>
<P>I likewise allow four hundred thousand pounds for Conti∣nental expences at home and abroad.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="016919_0006_0F9EC8BD6F21DB60"/>And four hundred thousand pounds for the support of the severel state governments, the amount then will be, <TABLE>

<P>I take the proportion of this state, Pennsylvania, to be an eighth part of the Thirteen United States, the quota then for us to raise will be two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling; two hundred thousand of which will be our share for the support and pay of the army and Continental expences at home and abroad, and fifty thousand pounds for the sup∣port of state government.</P>
<P>In order to gain an idea of the proportion in which the rais∣ing such a sum will fall, I make the following calculation▪</P>
<P>Pennsylvania contains three hundred and seventy five thou∣sand inhabitants, men, women and children, which is likewise an eighth part of the whole inhabitants of the United States: therefore two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling to be raised among three hundred and seventy five thousand persons, is, on an average, thirteen shillings and fourpence sterling per head per annum, or something more than one shilling ster∣ling per month. And our proportion of three quarters of a million for the government of the country, in time of peace, will be ninety three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds sterling, fifty thousand of which will be for the government expences of the state, and forty three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds for Continental expences at home and abroad.</P>
<P>The peace establishment then will, on an average, be five shillings sterling per head. Whereas was England now to stop, and the war cease, her peace establishment would continue the same as it is now, viz. forty shillings per head; therefore was our taxes necessary for carrying on the war as much per head as hers now is, and the difference to be only whether we should, at the end of the war, pay at the rate of five shillings per head, or forty shillings per head, the case needs no think∣ing of. But as we can securely defend and keep the country for one third less than what our burthen would be if it was conquered, and support the governments afterward for an eighth of what Britain would levy on us, and could I find a miser whose heart never felt the emotion of a spark of prin∣ciple, even that man, uninfluenced by every love but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="7" REF="016919_0007_0F9EC8BE067F0278"/>
of money, and capable of no attachment but to his interest, would, and must, from the frugality which governs him con∣tribute to the defence of the country, or he ceases to be a miser and becomes an ideot. But when we take in with it every thing that can ornament mankind; when the line of our in∣terest becomes the line of our happiness; when all that can chear and animate the heart; when sense of honor, fame, character, at home and abroad, are intervoven not only with the security but the increase of property, there exists not a man in America, unless he be a hired emissary, who does not see that his good is connected with keeping up a sufficient de∣fence.</P>
<P>I do not imagine that an instance can be produced in the world, of a country putting herself to such an amazing charge to conquer and enslave another as Britain has done. The sum is too great for her to think of with any tolerable degree of temper; and when we consider the burthen she sustains as well as the disposition she has shewn, it would be the height of folly in us to suppose that she would not reimburse herself by the most rapid means, had she once more America within her power. With such an oppression of expence, what would an empty conquest be to her! what relief under such circum∣stances could she derive from a victory without a prize? It was money, it was revenue, she first went to war for, and no∣thing but <HI>that</HI> would satisfy her. It is not the nature of ava∣rice to be satisfied with any thing else. Every passion that acts upon mankind has a peculiar mode of operation. Many of them are temporary and fluctuating; they admit of cessa∣tion and variety: But avarice is a fixed uniform passion. It neither abates of its vigour nor changes its object; and the reason why it does not is founded in the nature of things, for wealth has not a rival where avarice is a ruling passion. One beauty may excel another, and extinguish from the mind of a man the pictured remembrance of a former one: But wealth is the phoenix of avarice, and therefore cannot seek a new ob∣ject, because there is not another in the world.</P>
<P>I now pass on to shew the value of the present taxes, and compare them with the annual expence; but this I shall pre∣face with a few explanatory remarks.</P>
<P>There are two distinct things which make the payment of taxes difficult; the one is the large and real value of the sum to be paid, and the other is the scarcity of the thing in which the payment is to be made; and although these appear to be one and the same, they are in several instances not only dif∣ferent, but the difficulty springs from different causes.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016919_0008_0F9EC8BEC1EBC2A0"/>Suppose a tax was to be laid equal to one half of what every man's yearly income is, such a tax could not be paid because the property could not be spared; and on the other hand, sup∣pose a very trifling tax was laid to be collected in <HI>pearls,</HI> such a tax likewise could not be paid, because it could not be had. Now any person may see that these are distinct cases, and the latter of them is a representation of ours.</P>
<P>That the difficulty cannot proceed from the former, that is, from the real value or weight of the tax, is evident at first view to any person who will consider it.</P>
<P>The amount of the quota of taxes for this state for the pre∣sent year, 1780 (and so in proportion for every other state) is twenty millions of dollar, which at seventy for one is but sixty four thousand two hundred and eighty pounds three shil∣lings sterling, and on an average is no more than three shil∣lings and five pence sterling per head per annum men, wo∣men and children, or five pence per head per month. Now here is a clear positive fact, that cannot be contradicted, and which proves that the difficulty cannot be in the weight of the tax, for in itself it is a trifle and far from being adequate to our quota of the expence of the war. The quit rents of one penny sterling per acre on only one half the state, come to upwards of fifty thousand pounds, which is almost as much as all the taxes of the present year, and as those quit rents made no part of the taxes then paid, and are now dis∣continued, the quantity of money drawn for public service this year, exclusive of the militia fines, which I shall take no∣tice of in the process of this work, is less than what was paid and payable in any year preceding the revolution, and since the last war; what I mean is that the quit rents and taxes ta∣ken together came to a larger sum then than the present taxes without the quit rents do now.</P>
<P>My intention by these arguments and calculations is to place the difficulty to the right cause, and shew that it does not proceed from the weight or worth of the tax, but from the scarcity of the medium in which it is paid; and to illus∣trate this point still farther, I shall now shew, that if the tax of twenty millions of dollars was of four times the real va∣lue it now is or nearly so, which would be about two hun∣dred and fifty thousand pounds sterling, and would be our full quota, that this sum would have been raised with more case, and less felt, than the present sum of only sixty four thousand two hundred and eighty pounds.</P>
<P>The convenience or inconvenience of paying a tax in mo∣ney arises from the quantity of money that can be spared out of trade.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="016919_0009_0F9EC8BF81620CB8"/>When the emissions stopt, the continent was left in posses∣sion of two hundred millions of dollars, perhaps as equally dispersed as it was possible for trade to do it. And as no more was to be issued, the rise or fall of prices could neither increase nor diminish the quantity. It therefore remained the same through all the fluctuations of trade and exchange.</P>
<P>Now had the exchange stood at twenty for one, which was the rate congress calculated upon when they quoted the states the latter end of last year, trade would have been carried on for nearly four times less money than it is now, and conse∣quently the twenty millions would have been scared with much greater ease, and when collected would have been of almost four times the value they now are. And on the other hand, was the depreciation to be at ninety or one hundred for one, the quantity required for trade would be more than at sixty or seventy for one, and though the value of the tax would be less, the difficulty of sparing the money out of trade would be greater. And on these facts and arguments I rest the matter, to prove, that it is not the want of property, but the scarcity of the medium by which the proportion of property for taxation is to be measured out, that makes the embarrassment we lie under. There <HI>is not</HI> money enough, and what is equally as true, the people will not let there be money enough.</P>
<P>While I am on the subject of the currency, I shall offer one remark which will appear true to every body, and can be ac∣counted for by nobody, which is, that the better the times were, the worse the money grew; and the worse the times were, the better the money stood. It never depreciated by any advantage obtained by the enemy. The troubles of seventy six, and the loss of Philadelphia in seventy seven, made no sensible impression on it, and every one knows that the sur∣render of Charlestown did not produce the least alteration in the rate of exchange, which for long before, and for more than three months after, stood at sixty for one. It seems as if the certainty of its being our own made us careless of its value, and that the most distant thoughts of losing it made us hug it the closer, like something we were loth to part with; or that we depreciate it for our pastime, which, when called to seriousness by the enemy, we leave off to renew again at our leisure. In short our good luck seem to break us, and our bad make us whole.</P>
<P>Passing on from this digression, I shall now endeavor to bring into one view the several parts I have already stated, and form thereon some propositions, and conclude.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="016919_0010_0F9EC8C05FBE1170"/>I have placed before the reader, the average tax per head paid by the people in England; which is sorty shillings sterling.</P>
<P>And I have shewn the rate on an average per head, which will defray all the expence of the war to us, and support the several governments without running the country into debt, which is thirteen shillings and fourpence.</P>
<P>I have shewn what the peace establishment may be conduct∣ed for, viz. an eighth part of what it would be, if under the government of Britain.</P>
<P>And I have likewise shewn what the average per head of the present taxes are, namely, three shillings and five pence sterling or five pence per month; and that their whole yearly value in sterling is only sixty four thousand two hundred and eighty pounds. Whereas our quota to keep the payments equal with the expences, is two hundred and fifty thousand pounds. Consequently there is a deficiency of one hundred and eighty five thousand seven hundred and twenty pounds, and the same proportion of defect, according to the several quotas, happens in every other state. And this defect is the cause why the army has been so indifferently sed, cloathed and paid. It is the cause, likewise, of the nerveless state of the campaign, and the insecurity of the country. Now if a tax equal to thirteen and fourpence per head will remove all these difficulties, make people secure in their homes, leave them to follow the busi∣ness of their stores and farms unmolested, and not only keep out, but drive out the enemy from the country; and if the neglect of raising this sum will let them in, and produce the evils which might be prevented, on which side, I ask, does the wisdom, interest and policy lie? Or rather would it not be an insult to reason to put the question. The sum when portioned out according to the several abilities of the people, can hurt no one, but an inroad from the enemy ruins hun∣dreds of families.</P>
<P>Look at the destruction done in this city. The many hou∣ses totally destroyed, and others damaged; the waste of sen∣ces in the country round it, besides the plunder of furniture, forage and provision. I do not suppose that half a million sterling would reinstate the sufferers, and does this, I ask, bear any proportion to the expence that would make us se∣cure. The damage on an average is at least ten pound ster∣ling per head, which is as much as thirteen shillings and fourpence per head comes to for fifteen years. The same has happened on the frontiers, and in the Jersies, New York, and other places, where the enemy has been, Carolina and Georgia is likewise suffering the same fate.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="016919_0011_0F9EC8C10A1636E0"/>That the people generally do not understand the insuffi∣ciency of the taxes to carry on the war, is evident, not only from common observation, but from the construction of se∣veral petitions, which were presented to the assembly of this state, against the recommendation of congress of the 18th of March last, for taking up and funding the present currency at forty for one, and issuing new money in its stead. The prayer of the petitions was, <HI>That the currency might be ap∣preciated by taxes</HI> (meaning the present taxes) <HI>and that part of the taxes be applied to the support of the army, if the army could not be otherwise supported.</HI> Now it could not have been possi∣ble for such a petition to have been presented, had the peti∣tioners known, that so far from <HI>part</HI> of the taxes being suf∣ficient for the support of the army, the <HI>whole</HI> of them falls three fourths short of the year's expences.</P>
<P>Before I proceed to propose methods by which a sufficiency of money may be raised, I shall take a short review of the general state of the country.</P>
<P>Notwithstanding the weight of the war, the ravages of the enemy, and the obstructions she has thrown in the way of trade and commerce, so soon does a young country outgrow misfortune, that America has already surmounted many that once heavily oppressed her. For the first year or two of the war, we were shut up within our ports, scarce venturing to look towards the ocean. Now our rivers are beautified with large and valuable vessels, our stores filled with merchandize, and the produce of the country has a ready market, and an ad∣vantageous price. Gold and silver, that for a while seemed to have retreated again within the bowels of the earth, is once more risen into circulation, and every day adds new strength to trade, commerce, and agriculture. In a pamphlet written by Sir John Dalrymple, and dispersed in America in the year 1775, he asserted, that, <HI>two twenty gun ships, nay,</HI> says he, <HI>the tenders of those ships, stationed between Albermarle sound and Chesapeak bay, would shut up the trade of America for</HI> 600 <HI>miles.</HI> How little did Sir John Dalrymple know of the abilities of America!</P>
<P>While under the government of Britain, the trade of this country was loaded with restrictions. It was only a few fo∣reign ports she was allowed to sail to. Now it is otherwise; and allowing that the quantity of trade is but half what it was before the war, the case must shew the vast advantage of an open trade, because the present quantity under her re∣strictions could not support itself; from which I infer, that if half the quantity without the restrictions can bear itself up nearly, it not quite, as well as the whole when subject to them, how prosperous must the condition of America be when the whole shall return open with all the world. By trade I
<PB N="12" REF="016919_0012_0F9EC8C1D003E250"/>
do not mean the employment of a merchant only, but the whole interest and business of the country taken collectively.</P>
<P>It is not so much my intention, by this publication, to pro∣pose particular plans for raising money, as it is to shew the necessity and the advantages to be derived from it. My prin∣cipal design is to form the disposition of the people to such measures which I am fully persuaded is their interest and duty to adopt, and which needs no other force to accomplish them than the force of being felt. But as every hint <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, I shall throw out a stretch, and leave others <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> make <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> improvements upon it as to them may appear reasonable.</P>
<P>The annual sum wanted is two millions, and the average rate in which it falls is thirteen shillings and fourpence per head.</P>
<P>Suppose then that we raise half the sum and sixty thousand pounds over. The average rate thereof will be seven shil∣lings per head.</P>
<P>In this case we shall have half the supply we want, and an annual fund of sixty thousand pounds whereon to borrow the other million; because sixty thousand pounds is the interest of a million at six per cent. and if at the end of another year we should be obliged, by the continuance of the war, to bor∣row another million, the taxes will be increased to seven shil∣lings and sixpence; and thus for every million borrowed, an additional tax equal to sixpence per head must be levied.</P>
<P>The sum then to be raised next year will be one million and sixty thousand pounds: One half of which I would propose should be raised by duties on imported goods and prize goods, and the other half by a tax on landed property and houses, or such other means as each state may devise.</P>
<P>But as the duties on imports and prize goods must be the same in all the states, therefore the rate per cent. or in what other form the duty shall be laid, must be ascertained and re∣gulated by congress, and ingrafted in that form into the law of each state; and the monies arising therefrom carried into the treasury of each state. The duties to be paid in gold or silver.</P>
<P>There are many reasons why a duty on imports is the most convenient duty or tax that can be collected, one of which is, because the whole is payable in a few places in a country, and it likewise operates with the greatest ease and equality, because as every one pays in proportion to what he con∣sumes, the people in general consume in proportion to what they an afford, and therefore the tax is regulated by the abi∣lities
<PB N="13" REF="016919_0013_0F9EC8C29CA7BD38"/>
which every man supposes himself to have, or in other words every man becomes his own assessor, and pays by a little at a time when it suits him to buy. Besides, it is a tax which people may pay or let alone by not consuming the articles; and though the alternative may have no influence on their con∣duct, the power of choosing is an agreeable thing to the mind. For my own part, it would be a satisfaction to me, was there a duty on all sorts of liquors during the war, as in any idea of things, it would be an addition to the pleasure of society, to know, that when the health of the army goes round, a few drops from every glass become theirs. How often have I heard an emphatical wish almost accompanied with a tear, <HI>"Oh, that our poor fellows in the field had some of this!"</HI> Why then need we suffer under a fruitless sympathy, when there is a way to enjoy both the wish and the entertainment at once?</P>
<P>But the great national policy of putting a duty upon imports is, that it either keeps the foreign trade in our own hands or draws something for the defence of the country from every fo∣reigner who participates it with us.</P>
<P>Thus much for the first half of the taxes, and as each state will best devise means to raise the other half, I shall confine my remarks to the resources of this state.</P>
<P>The quota then of this state of one million and sixty thou∣sand pounds will be one hundred and thirty-three thousand two hundred and fifty pounds, the half of which is sixty-six thousand six hundred and twenty-five pounds; and supposing one fourth part of Pennsylvania inhabited, then a tax of one bushel of wheat on every twenty acres of land, one with an∣other, would produce the sum, and all the present taxes to cease. Whereas the tythes of the bishops and clergy in Eng∣land, exclusive of the taxes, are upwards of half a bushel of wheat on <HI>every single</HI> acre of land, good and bad, throughout the nation.</P>
<P>In a former part of this paper I mentioned the militia fines, but reserved speaking to the matter, which I shall now do: The ground I shall put it open is, that two millions sterling a year will support a sufficient army, and all the expences of war, and government, without having recourse to the inconvenient method of continually calling men from their employments, which of all others is the most expensive and the least substantial. I consider the revenue created by taxes as the first and princi∣pal thing, and fines only as secondary and accidental things. It was not the intention of the militia law to apply the mili∣tia fines to any thing else but the support of the militia, neither do they produce any revenue to the state, yet these fines amount to more than all the taxes; for taking the muster
<PB N="14" REF="016919_0014_0F9EC8C350D3F7D8"/>
roll to be sixty thousand men, the fine on forty thousand who may not attend, will be sixty thousand pounds sterling, and those who muster, will give <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> portion of time equal to half that sum, and if the eight classes should be called within the year, and one third turn out, the fine on the remaining forty thousand would amount to seventy two millions of dollars, be∣sides the fifteen shillings on every hundred pounds property, and the charge of seven and a half per cent for collecting in certain instances, which on the whole would be upwards of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling.</P>
<P>Now if those very fines disable the country from raising a sufficient revenue without producing an equivalent advantage, would it not be to the ease and interest of all parties to en∣crease the revenue, in the manner I have proposed, or any better, if a better can be devised, and cease the operation of the fines. I would still keep the militia as an organized body of men, and should there be a real necessity to call them forth, pay them out of the proper revenues of the state, and encrease the taxes a third or fourth per cent. on those who did not attend. My limits will not allow me to go farther into this matter, which I shall therefore close with this re∣mark; that fines are, of all modes of revenue, the most un∣suited to the mind of a free country. When a man pays a tax, he knows the public necessity requires it, and therefore feels a pride in discharging his duty; but a fine seems an at∣tonement for neglect of duty, and of consequence is paid with discredit, and frequently levied with severity.</P>
<P>I have now only one subject more to speak to, with which I shall conclude, which is, the resolve of congress of the 18th of March last, for taking up and funding the present curren∣cy at forty for one, and issuing new money in its stead.</P>
<P>Every one knows I am not the flatterer of congress, but in this instance <HI>they are right;</HI> and if that measure is supported, the currency will acquire a value, which without it, it will not. But this it not all: It will give relief to the finances until such time as they can be properly arranged, and save the country from being immediately double taxed under the present mode. In short, support that measure, and it will support you.</P>
<P>I have now waded through a tedious course of difficult busi∣ness, and over an untrodden path. The subject on every point it could be viewed was entangled with perplexities, and inveloped in obscurity, yet such are the resources of America, that she wants nothing but system to insure success.</P>

<P><PB N="15" REF="016919_0015_0F9EC8C408C76020"/>P. S. While this paper was preparing for the press, the treachery of General Arnold became known, and en∣grossed the attention and conversation of the public; and that, not so much on account of the traitor as the magnitude of the treason, and the providence evident in the discovery. The matter, as far as is at present known, is thus briefly re∣lated.</P>
<P>General Arnold about six weeks before had obtained the command of the important post of West Point, situated on the North river, about sixty miles above New York, and an hundred below Albany, there being no other defenceable pass between it and the last mentioned place. At what time, or in what manner, he first entered into a negociation with the enemy for betraying the fort and garrison into their hands, does not yet appear.</P>
<P>While Arnold commanded at West Point, General Wash∣ington and the minister of France went to Hartford in Con∣necticut, to consult on matters, in concert with Admiral Terney commander of the French fleet stationed at Rhode Island. In the mean time Arnold held a conference with Major Andre, Adjutant General to General Clinton, whom he traiterously furnished with plans of the fort, state of the garrison, minutes of the last council of war, and the man∣ner in which he would post the troops when the enemy should attempt a surprise; and then gave him a pass, by the name of Mr. John Anderson, to go to the lines at the White Plains or lower, if he Mr. Anderson thought proper, he being (the pass said) on public business.</P>
<P>Thus furnished, Andre parted from Arnold, set off for New York, and had nearly arrived at the extent of our lines, when he was stopped by a party of militia, to whom he pro∣duced his pass, but they, not being satisfied with his account, insisted on taking him before the commanding officer Lieut. Col. Jamieson. Finding himself in this situation, and hoping to escape by a bribe, he offered them his purse, watch and a pro∣mise of any quantity of goods they would accept, which these honest men nobly and virtuously scorned, and consistent with their duty took him to the proper officer. On exami∣nation there was found on him the above mentioned papers and several others, all in the hand writing of General Arnold, and finding himself thus detected, he confessed his proper name and character; he was accordingly made a close pri∣soner, and the papers sent off by express to West Point, at which place General Washington had arrived soon after the arrival of the packet. On this disclosure, he went in quest of Arnold, whom he had not seen that day, but all that could be learned was, that Arnold had received a letter some short time before, which had much confused him, since which he had disappeared. Colonel Hamilton, one of General Wash∣ington's aids, with some others were sent after him, but he
<PB N="16" REF="016919_0016_0F9EC8C4D257CD00"/>
having the start eluded the pursuit, took boat under pretence of a flag, and got on board the Vulture sloop of war lying in the North river; on which it may be truly said, that one vulture was receiving another. From on board this vessel he addressed a letter to General Washington, which, in what∣ever light it may be viewed, confirms him a finished villain.</P>
<P>The true character of Arnold is that of a desperado. His whole life has been a life of jobbs; and where either plunder or profit was the object, no danger deterred, no principle re∣strained him. In his person he was smart and active, some∣what diminutive, weak in his capacities and trifling in his conversation; and though gallant in the field, was defective in the talents necessary for command. The early convulsion of the times afforded him an introduction into life, to the ele∣gance of which he was before a stranger, and the eagerness of the public, to reward and encourage enterprize, procured him at once both applause and promotion. His march to Quebec gave him fame, and the plunder of Montreal put the first stamp to his public character. His behaviour at Danbury and Saratoga once more covered over his crimes, which again broke forth in the plunder of Phila∣delphia, under pretence of supplying the army. From this time, the true spring of his conduct being <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he became both disregarded and disesteemed, and this last instance of his treachery has proved the public judgment right.</P>
<P>When we take a review of the history of former times, it will turn out to the honor of America, that, notwithstanding the trying variety of her situation, this is the only instance of defection in a general officer; and even in this case the un∣shaken honesty of those who detected him heightens the na∣tional character, to which his apost<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> serves as a foil. From the nature of his crime, and his disposition to monopolize, it is reasonable to conclude he had few or no <HI>direct</HI> accomplices. His sole object was to make a monied bargain; and to be consistent with himself, he would as readily betray the side he has deserted to, as that he deserted from.</P>
<P>But there is one reflection results from this black business, that deserves notice, which is, that it shows the declining power of the enemy. An attempt to bribe is a sacrifice of military fame, and a confession of inability to conquer; as a proud people they ought to be above it, and as soldiers to despise it; and however they may feel on the occasion, the world at large will despise them for it, and consider America superior to their arms.</P>
