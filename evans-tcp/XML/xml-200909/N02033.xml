<HEAD>The Publisher TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<P>I Was advised by some pious Persons, who desire Peace and Union amongst Christians, to re-print this Dis∣course, in hopes of its good Effect on all impartial Readers.</P>
<P>The Arguments being wholly Scriptu∣ral, are not only convincing, but mana∣ged with so much Charity, that few Books of Controversy in Religion can expect a better Reception.</P>
<P>Upon a serious perusal of this Piece, it will appear clear and evident, That whosoever justly sustains the Character of a Minister of the Gospel of Christ, hath, besides his Internal Qualifications, an External Visible Commission deliver∣ed to him, by those who have Power and Authority to grant it: From whence these Inferences do naturally flow.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="002417_0003_0FDB3E1907DA0A50"/><HI>First,</HI> That the Ministers of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who freely own that the Power of Ordinations was first vested in the Apostles, and from them, through all Ages since, in a succession of <HI>Bishops,</HI> from whence they derive their own Or∣dinations, are to be acknowledged true Ministers of the Gospel.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That it is a daring Of∣fence to intrude into the sacred Function, without a regular designation to the Ex∣ercise of it. See <HI>Numb. 16.40. 2 Sam, 6.6, 7. 2 Chron. 26.19, 20, 21, 22. Heb. 5.4, 5.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That People ought to en∣deavour after all the Assurance they can attain to, that they have the Means of Grace in the Word and Sacraments, duly administred and dispensed unto them, by Persons fully authorized for those holy Offices. For since the <HI>Priest's Lips are to preserve Knowledge,</HI> the People ought to be satisfied that they are really such, at whose Mouth they <HI>seek the Law.</HI> And,</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> That it is a very criminal Presumption, and an unsufferable Inso∣lence
<PB N="iii" REF="002417_0004_0FDB3E1C6A6FFBB0"/>
in some, to value their Gifts at so high a rate, as to think themselves by the virtue of them, entituled to the Ministerial Office, without being admit∣ted by the Imposition of the Hands of those, whom Christ has ordered to pre∣side over the affairs of his Church.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That since there is no ap∣proaching before God's Altar, without the appointed Rites of Consecration, nor any medling with his Institutions with∣out his Order and Command; Those in∣vaders of the sacred Services, cannot be said to be the <HI>Ambassadors of God,</HI> or accounted the <HI>Stewards of the Mys∣teries of Christ,</HI> who presume to touch those holy Things, with their unhallow∣ed Hands, and like <HI>Saul,</HI> would sacri∣fice without a Call, <HI>1 Sam. 13.9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.</HI> For those who offer <HI>strange Fire before the Lord,</HI> their Incence must be <HI>an Abomination to him, Levit. 10.12.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Tho' we can by no means question our Saviour's Gifts and Abili∣ties, yet he did not enter upon his Ministry, until he was solemnly inaugu∣rated
<PB N="iv" REF="002417_0005_0FDB3E1E4C10C2A8"/>
into that Office; for he glorified not himself to be made an High Priest, but he that said unto him, <HI>Thou art my Son,</HI> which was said unto him at his Baptism, <HI>Luke 2.22.</HI> So when he was about to leave the World, be Com∣missioned others to go upon the great Embassy of Reconciliation, to transact in his Name, and proclaim and seal his Pardons, saying, <HI>As my Father sent me, so send I you:</HI> Whereupon he immediately gave them the power of Censures and Absolutions, <HI>John 20.22, 23. Matth. 28.19, 20.</HI> And they also before their Death, imparted their Power to others, by Imposition of Hands. Thus the Apostles ordained seven Dea∣cons, <HI>Act. 6.5, 6.</HI> among other Servi∣ces, to <HI>Preach</HI> and to <HI>Baptize,</HI> in the Exercise of which Offices we find St. <HI>Philip,</HI> one of them, diligently employ∣ed, <HI>Acts 8.1</HI> &amp;c. Thus <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> ordained Elders in every Church, <HI>Acts 14.23.</HI> And thus St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who had ordained <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> appointed <HI>Titus</HI> to ordain El∣ders in every City in <HI>Crete, Tit. 1.5.</HI> And that these sacred Offices should con∣tinue
<PB N="v" REF="002417_0006_0FDB3E1FC4066D10"/>
in a regular Ministry to the end of the World, is undeniable from <HI>Math. 6.18.</HI> and Chap. <HI>28.19, 20.</HI> and <HI>Eph. 4.11, 12, 13.</HI> And finally, that there was a preheminence of Jurisdiction and Authority in some of these Church-Offi∣ces over others, is plainly proved in this Treatise, in the Apostolical Dignity (to which the Episcopal must needs suc∣ceed) over the <HI>seventy,</HI> and the <HI>Dea∣cons;</HI> and St. <HI>Paul's</HI> Epistles to <HI>Timo∣thy</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> where we find many marks of the Power of those <HI>Bishops</HI> over their inferiour <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as to Ordain them, or upon occasion to promote them to a higher Order, to Judge and Censure them, and if the case required, to proceed to Deposition. This is the standing Ministry that the Church of <HI>England</HI> claims a Part and Lot in: This is the Nature and true Notion of a Gospel Ministry, as we find it founded by our Saviour and his Apostles.</P>

<HEAD>A Modest Proof OF THE <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Government</HI> Settled by Christ and his Apostles IN THE CHURCH.</HEAD>
<P>MY design is at present, to represent to the World, what was the primitive Model, or Form of Church-Govern∣ment; what was settl'd by our Saviour, and his <HI>Apostles,</HI> in this point; and that from what is recorded of the matter in the Books of the New-Testament: This is evident from the Title-page; and the end of this undertaking is in order to let all Parties contending for various Forms see which is really the right one, with which if they compare their own, they
<PB N="2" REF="002417_0008_0FDB3E238A577218"/>
may be enabl'd to continue it or reject it as it agrees with, or deviates from the first Institution.</P>
<P>Now the Church however harrassed and disquieted, with a great variety of Disputes and Debates, about points of <HI>Doctrine</HI> and <HI>Discipline;</HI> yet heard little or no noise made, for above 1400 years, a∣bout <HI>this</HI> point of <HI>Church-Government.</HI> One <HI>Aerius</HI> started a debate, but had so few to second him that it died with himself, and left his name on record among <HI>Hereticks.</HI></P>
<P>The goodly Order and <HI>Government</HI> in∣stituted by Christ, stood firm for many Ages; and under it the Church flourish∣ed, and the Christian Religion mightily prevailed, notwithstanding the violent Persecutions of <HI>those</HI> times: But at length it was invaded, and suppressed by the Usurpation and Tyranny of the <HI>Romans Papacy.</HI> A <HI>secular Power,</HI> and <HI>Dominion</HI> was set up; and the <HI>Doctrine, Worship,</HI> and <HI>Discipline</HI> of the Church, following the fate of its Government, were corrupted. Error, Superstition, Idolatry and Tyran∣ny, the Pillars of the Papal Kingdom, were introduced: And all maintained, on the one hand, by a most false and blas∣phemous Pretension to an Absolute infal∣lible Power and Authority derived from Christ; and on the other, by a most horrid and cruel Persecution of all who
<PB N="3" REF="002417_0009_0FDB3E25004215F8"/>
did but matter the least Dissent.</P>
<P>Thus lay the Church for some Ages, groaning under this <HI>Anti-christian Usurpa∣tion,</HI> struggling and wrestling even unto Blood and Martyrdom, to recover its primitive Purity and Liberty. It pleased the Lord at length, to deliver it in part, and to retrieve its <HI>Doctrine, Worship, Dis∣cipline</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> by a longwish'd for Reformation: A Reformation which had been much more happy and compleat, had not the <HI>Adversary</HI> scattered his Tares among the good Seed which sprung up in Briars and Thorns: Had not some Doctrines and Customs, maintained by one part of the Reformed Church, and rejected by an other, occasioned not dis∣putes, which gave no less disturbance to the Church, than they yielded Pleasure and Diversion to the <HI>Common Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>Among other differences this was one; that while the greatest and most consi∣derable part of the Reformed Church, retained the Ancient Order and <HI>Govern∣ment,</HI> and vindicated it from the Usurpa∣tions and Encroachments of the <HI>Papacy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cal. Inst. lib. 4. Cap. 10. § 32.</HI> ne eccelesia ecclesiae con∣temnat ob ex∣ternae disci∣plinae variata∣tem.</NOTE> Others (upon what considerations I shall not enquire) were pleased to set up a new Form and Model of Policy, with a modest kind protestation, that these their different Measures, should be no Ground of breach between them, and other <HI>Re∣formed
<PB N="4" REF="002417_0010_0FDB3E296383F310"/>
Churches:</HI> But this did not prevent Disputes upon that Head, and every Church defending its own Model, as most agreeable to the first Institution, the debate came to that height, as to occasi∣on a sad Rupture and Schism; a Schism which has produc'd no where more wo∣ful effects, than in these three Kingdoms: What Alienation of Minds among profes∣sors of the same <HI>Reformed Religion,</HI> what Confusions and barbarous Cruelties, what Convulsions and Revolutions in Church and State, what publick and private Mis∣chiefs, have sprung from this Root of Bitterness, the Histories of the past Age, give a very sad and lamentable Account: And above all, the malignant Influence it hath had on Religion, to obstruct the Life and Practice of true Christianity, cannot be sufficiently <HI>regretted.</HI></P>
<P>I doubt not but the <HI>Common Enemy,</HI> and they whose trade it is to fish in muddy Waters, have been very active to <HI>blow this Coal;</HI> but that which hath sometimes made this Debate break forth in <HI>Vesuvian Flames,</HI> and be disputed with Fire and Sword, with Blood and Wounds, is, That it hath been incorporated into, and join∣ed with other Political Debates and State-differences; It were easie to demonstrate this, did not the evidence of it render it needless; that <HI>Political Interests</HI> and <HI>State-differences,</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="002417_0011_0FDB3E2C82B9D0A0"/>
have all along been interwoven with this contest about <HI>Church-Govern∣ment,</HI> and have supported and maintained it: And perhaps at the Bottom, 'tis none of the least prejudices against <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> that they of that Perswasion have gene∣rally asserted the <HI>just Rights</HI> and <HI>Preroga∣tives of Princes,</HI> as the surest Foundation of a Kingdoms Happiness and Tranqui∣lity; and accordingly have maintained the Doctrines of <HI>Non-resistance,</HI> and <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> &amp;c. whereas its Rival <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> hath been thought by some, more serviceable for Checking and Curbing the <HI>Power of Princes.</HI> Certain it is, there is <HI>too</HI> much of a Carnal and worldly Spi∣rit, that keeps this Debate so long alive; and there is little hopes it will die,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.3.</NOTE> till Christians be more animated with the true Spirit and Temper of the Gospel.</P>
<P>I am sensible there have been many Vo∣lumes which have appear'd in the World upon this Argument, which may seem, or be expected to have exhausted the Subject on both sides; and this may be a prejudice against my present undertak∣ing, as superfluous: And the little good effect those Volumes have had, may make it be look'd upon as Presumption in me to fancy that what I have to offer will do any good, where so little has been effected by those that have gone before me. But
<PB N="6" REF="002417_0012_0FDB3E2E01C8BDC8"/>
I remember the Story of <HI>Spiridion,</HI> a fa∣mous Bishop, for Piety, Hospitality and many Miracles, who, is said, to have confounded, at the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> a certain Philosopher, who by the subtilty of his Arguments against Christianity, sought to imbarass the Bishops. <HI>Spiridion</HI> takes the Discourse, and prays the Philo∣sopher, in the Name of Christ, to hear him; and so goes on, repeating the Ar∣ticles of the Christian Faith, which, when the Philosopher heard, with great Astonishment he said; <HI>So long as any rea∣soned with me, I opposed other Reasons; but now when God speaks to me, by the Mouth of that old Man, I am not able to answer, I find a secret force upon my Spirit, convincing me and perswading me.</HI> I shall with God's Assistance, follow the Method of this holy Man, in giving as plain and impar∣tial an Account of the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> instituted by Christ and his Apostles in the Christian Church, as I am able to collect from the sacred <HI>Records</HI> of the New Testament, to which I purpose closely to adhere. Possibly, what I offer may have as good effect upon some of my Readers, as the good Bishop's like Conduct upon another Occasion, had with the Philosopher: And a clear, and full View of the first Scriptural Institution of Church Government set before our
<PB N="7" REF="002417_0013_0FDB3E31A0EE09D8"/>
Eyes, may enable all Parties to see most clearly which of the Forms now con∣tended for and promoted, bid fairest to be true Copies of the Divine Original.</P>
<P>To proceed the more Methodically, I shall produce what I have to say upon this great Subject, under these four Heads.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. First, I will shew what sacred Offi∣ces, were instituted by Christ and his Apostles, in the Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>II. Secondly, I will make it appear, how these Offices were distinguish'd, and demonstrate an Imparity among them.</ITEM>
<ITEM>III. Thirdly, I will examine whether any of them were extraordinary and temporary, and prove that they were not, but design'd to be perpetual, and stand∣ing in the Church.</ITEM>
<ITEM>IV. Fourthly, supposing these Offices to be standing, I will shew who succeed in them, and rightly execute them to this day.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P N="1">I. First, then, I am to shew what sa∣cred Offices were instituted by Christ, and his Apostles in the Church.</P>
<P>When our blessed Lord appeared in his publick Ministry, in the beginning there∣of he called many unto him, to be his ordinary Attendants, of whom, some had been trained up under <HI>John</HI>'s Ministry; These were in a peculiar manner his
<PB N="8" REF="002417_0014_0FDB3E3338B8DFC0"/>
Disciples, in distinction from the multi∣tude of Proselites, who were gained by his preaching and Miracles; and he made use of the Ministry of these his Disciples, in baptizing such as were proselited, as those were baptiz'd,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>John</HI> 4. v. 1.2.</NOTE> who were made <HI>Proselites</HI> under the old Dispensation. The Eminent Prophets whom GOD raised up to his People, gathered a School or Col∣ledge of Disciples, called, <HI>The Sons of the Prophets,</HI> who were trained up under their Inspection and Discipline to the Prophe∣tical Office: So it is to be conceiv'd of the Disciples of <HI>John</HI> the Baptist, and of our Lord, that they were as two Semina∣ries wherein many were trained up, under the Discipline and Instruction of these two eminent Masters as <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Gospel Ministry: Our blessed Lord be∣ing thus attended, with his <HI>Disciples, Mat.</HI> 9. went about, <HI>in his own Person,</HI> <Q>all the Cities and Villages, teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing every Sickness and every Disease among the People. And when he saw the Multi∣tudes come Flocking to him from all quarters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">v. 35.</NOTE> he was moved with Compas∣sion on them, because they fainted, <HI>(being 'tis like wearied with their long Journies)</HI> and were scattered abroad as Sheep having no Shepherd.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. 36, 37, 38.</NOTE> Then said
<PB N="9" REF="002417_0015_0FDB3E34C3C9C9A0"/>
he to his Disciples, the Harvest truly is plenteous, but the Labourers are few, pray ye the Lord of the Harvest, that he send forth Labourers to his Harvest.</Q> Upon this St. <HI>Mark</HI> tells us,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Mark the</HI> 3d. v. 13.14.</NOTE> <Q>He goeth unto a Mountain, and calleth unto him whom he would,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 6. v. 12.13.</NOTE> and they came unto him. St. <HI>Luke</HI> adds, "That he went to this Mountain to pray, and continued all night in Prayer to GOD, and when it was day, he called unto him his Disciples, and of them he chose and ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach; whom also he named <HI>APOSTLES.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Some time after,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 9. v. 1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>He called these twelve together, and gave them Power and Authority over all Devils, and to cure Diseases, and sent them forth to preach the Kingdom of GOD, and to heal the Sick;</HI> We have their Commission at large, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10. After their return from executing which first Commission, they continue with their Master as his constant Attendants; and we read not, that, during his abode on Earth, they were sent forth a second time; until he gave them their last and full Commission, a little before his Ascen∣sion.</P>
<P>Some time after the return of the A∣postles, <HI>He appointed other seventy,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Luke</HI> 10.</NOTE> <HI>and sent
<PB N="10" REF="002417_0016_0FDB3E38272272A8"/>
them forth,</HI> with the same Commission and the same Power, that he had sent the Apostles, to preach the Gospel, to cast out Devils, to heal Diseases, and almost in all things with the same instructions, concerning their Conduct: which makes the <HI>Continuator of</HI> Pool<HI>'s Annotations on the place,</HI> say, <HI>how some come to imagine a dif∣ference of Order betwixt them and the Apostles, I cannot tell:</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cal. Inst. lib. 4. Cap. 3 Sect. 4.</HI> dignitate Apostolis mino∣res, Officiis proximi, au<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s secundo ab A∣postolis loco Christius desig∣navit.</NOTE> Yet <HI>Calvin</HI> scruples not to call them, in dignity less than the Apo∣stles, next in Office to them, designed by Christ in the second place after the Apostles.</P>
<P>Here we see, in what a solemn man∣ner, Christ instituted the first and prime Officers of his Church, who are particu∣larly described by their Number, Names, and that honourable Designation by which he called them: Whom he also named Apostles.</P>
<P>Indeed all the difference expressed in these two <HI>Missions,</HI> is, that we read not of such a <HI>solemn Inauguration</HI> of the <HI>seventy</HI> unto their Office, as of the <HI>twelve;</HI> and that the <HI>Twelve</HI> were particularly ho∣noured with the Title of <HI>APOSTLES,</HI> even before they were sent forth (of the importance of which Name, we shall af∣terwards enquire); but the <HI>seventy,</HI> tho' they were sent forth immediately by Christ, are no where so called, but only
<PB N="11" REF="002417_0017_0FDB3E3939375E90"/>
Disciples. But though their Commission was much the same, with what was giv∣en to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> (who had not as yet received their <HI>full Commission</HI>) yet it is most certain, that they were two <HI>distinct Orders</HI> of Gospel Ministers: they are ne∣ver numbred together, but in two distinct <HI>Classes.</HI> The Apostles are still <HI>twelve</HI> and not <HI>eighty two;</HI> And (which puts it be∣yond all question) when a Vacancy falls in the Colledge of <HI>Apostles,</HI> by the Apos∣tacy of <HI>Judas,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 1</NOTE> what a solemn Work was there, at the Translation of one from the Number of Disciples, that he might be reckoned and numbred with the <HI>Eleven,</HI> and succeed to <HI>Judas</HI> his Apostle-ship?</P>
<P>Thus have we seen two Orders of Gos∣pel Ministers instituted by Christ himself. There is a third Order instituted by his Apostles, <HI>that</HI> of <HI>Deacons.</HI> The occasion, design, and manner of instituting this new Order, we have fully set down in the sixth Chapter of the <HI>Acts</HI> of the holy Apostles, from the first to the seventh <HI>verse.</HI></P>
<P>Of this Institution I shall only observe, That <HI>it</HI> was made by the <HI>twelve Apostles,</HI> to whom the <HI>Government</HI> of the Church was principally committed, and who had Power and Authority to institute new Offices and Officers as the Exigence of the Church should require; That these
<PB N="12" REF="002417_0018_0FDB3E3E87016D30"/>
<HI>Deacons</HI> were appointed and set apart to their Office by the <HI>Apostles,</HI> with the Ce∣remony of <HI>Prayer and Imposition of Hands,</HI> which was usual in designing and ap∣pointing Persons to any sacred Office, in the Gospel Ministry: And further, that these <HI>Deacons</HI> thus separated and ordain∣ed, were invested with some share of the <HI>Apostolick Office,</HI> particularly of <HI>Preach∣ing</HI> and <HI>Baptizing,</HI> as well as managing the publick Stock of the Church, which they exerted in subordination to the <HI>A∣postles,</HI> under their Inspection and by their Direction; That <HI>Stephen</HI> was a Preacher (and the rest of them, of whom we have nothing on record, save their Names) as well as <HI>Philip,</HI> cannot be doubted. <HI>Stephen</HI> by his Zeal in propagating the Gospel, became the first Martyr; and of <HI>Philip</HI> we expresly read, that by his Preaching, he converted <HI>Samaria</HI> and initiated the Converts there, into the Christian Pro∣fession by <HI>Baptism.</HI> Hence we afterwards find him dignified with the honourable Title of <HI>Philip the Evangelist,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Act.</HI> 8. and 21.2.</NOTE> though but one of the Seven.</P>
<P>This I observe to shew, the vast dif∣ference betwixt these <HI>Gospel Deacons</HI> in∣stituted and ordained by the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and <HI>those</HI> who are named <HI>Deacons</HI> under the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Model, without any Ordina∣tion or Power to Preach or Baptize, that
<PB N="13" REF="002417_0019_0FDB3E3E88F2F460"/>
none may be imposed upon by the bare Name, to think them to be of <HI>Divine</HI> or <HI>Apostolick Institution.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much shall serve to shew what I promis'd in the first place, what sacred Offices were instituted by Christ, and his Apostles in the Church.</P>
<P N="2">II. I now come to what I promis'd in the second place, to make it appear how these Offices were distinguished; and to demonstrate an imparity among them.</P>
<P>Now of the last mentioned, there is no debate; all acknowledge that <HI>Deacons</HI> were different from, and inferiour to the two former Offices of Apostles, and the Seventy; 'tis of these two that some are pleased to pronounce that they are one and the same; whereas what I have al∣ready observed of their Institution, plain∣ly shows them to have been distinct Offices, and they are every where spoken of in Scripture as such: particularly in that enumeration of Gospel Officers, I <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.28. <HI>God hath set in his Church, first Apostles, secondarily Prophets, thirdly Teachers: Are all Apostles, are all Prophets, are all Teachers?</HI> Though every Apostle was a Prophet and Teacher, the Superi∣our Order including the Inferiour; yet every Prophet and Teacher, was not an
<PB N="14" REF="002417_0020_0FDB3E3FFA2C41F8"/>
Apostle (as for the rest in that Enume∣ration, they are not distinct Offices, but various and different Powers and Gifts wherewith the Gospel Officers were en∣dued.)</P>
<P>Supposing then the <HI>Deacons</HI> inferiour to the Apostles and Seventy, the question is concerning the <HI>twelve</HI> who were called <HI>Apostles,</HI> and the <HI>seventy and others of their Order,</HI> who go by the name of Prophets, in a Gospel Sense; Ministers of the Word and Sacraments,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Acts</HI> 15.32. <HI>Eph.</HI> 2.20. Ch. 3.5. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 14.3.</NOTE> such as <HI>Judas</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> were; who are also called <HI>Prophets, Evan∣gelists, Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> in the 4th Chapter to the <HI>Ephesians</HI> and the 11th <HI>Verse.</HI></P>
<P>I say, the question is whether these <HI>Prophets, Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> and <HI>Evange∣lists,</HI> were of the same Office and Order with the <HI>Apostles?</HI> Or, whether they were of a <HI>distinct Office</HI> and <HI>Order,</HI> and inferiour to that of the <HI>Apostles?</HI> For clearing this we must consider their <HI>Commissions,</HI> and the Exercise of their Office conform∣able to their Commissions.</P>
<P>And first of the <HI>Apostles.</HI> All that their first Commission did bear, was to Preach the Gospel and to Administer the Ordi∣nances of Religion; and this was all the exercise of their Apostolick Office that we read of, during Christ's bodily pre∣sence with them, and in this, (as I said)
<PB N="15" REF="002417_0021_0FDB3E439B0A1A98"/>
they differed little from the <HI>seventy:</HI> But when Christ was to leave the Earth, having finished the Work of our Redemp∣tion, He enlarged their Commission, and put them in actual exercise of their A∣postolick Power and Office.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Matth. 28.17, 18.</NOTE> <HI>All Power</HI> (says he) <HI>is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth, go ye therefore and Disciple all Na∣tions, Baptizing them in the Name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, teaching them to observe all things whatso∣ever I have commanded you, and lo, I am with you alway even to the end of the World.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 24.50.</NOTE> <HI>And he lifted up his Hands, and blessed them,</HI> and said unto them, <HI>As my Fathen sent me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John. 20.21.</NOTE> <HI>so send I you,</HI> <Q>and thus saying, he breath∣ed upon them, and said unto them, Receive ye the Holy Ghost, whose soever Sins ye forgive, they are forgiven, and whose soever Sins ye retain, they are retained.</Q> We read moreover,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 1.</NOTE> <Q>That through the Holy Ghost he gave Com∣mandments to his Apostles whom he had chosen, to whom he shewed him∣self alive after his Sufferings, by many infallible Signs, being seen of them for the space of Forty Days, and speak∣ing unto them of the things pertaining to the Kingdom of God.</Q><NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Cave</HI>'s Antiq.

<P>All this Commission and Instruction was given particularly to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> as being his <HI>Prime</HI> and Special Delegates,
<PB N="16" REF="002417_0022_0FDB3E4545FD89F0"/>
whom he intrusted with the Affairs of his Church, to act and do, in his Name and his Authority: And this is the common Notion and Importance of the Word <HI>Apostle,</HI> according to the use of the Word among the <HI>Jews:</HI> He is a Messen∣ger endued with peculiar Letters of Au∣thority and Commission, whereby he acts as Proxy and Deputy of him who sends him; and it is a Proverb among the <HI>Jews,</HI> that <HI>every Man's Apostle is as him∣self:</HI> What he does by vertue of his Commission, is look'd upon to be as firm and valid, as if the Person himself had done it.</P>
<P>These <HI>Twelve</HI> then whom Christ na∣med <HI>Apostles,</HI> were to represent his Per∣son, to act as his special <HI>Ambassadors,</HI> to communicate his Will and Mind, to preach and propagate his Gospel, to in∣struct and disciple the World in the Doctrines and Precepts of Christianity, and on this Doctrine to found and build the Church, and to govern the same in his Name and Authority, constituting and ordaining Ministers of Religion, settling good Order, and disposing all Affairs for the Edification of the Church, determining and deciding Controversies in Religion, composing Differences, in∣specting and superintending the ordinary Pastors in the Discharge of their Office,

censuring and punishing contumacious Offenders, and loosing such as were Pe∣nitent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11.28.</NOTE> This the Apostle calls the <HI>Care of all the Churches,</HI> especially them of his Province; for, their Commission was unlimitted and universal, not only in respect of <HI>Power,</HI> to discharge all Acts of Religion, relating either to <HI>Ministry</HI> or <HI>Government;</HI> but also in respect of <HI>Place,</HI> not being confined to any particular Pro∣vince, but sent to the whole World; yet for the more orderly executing their Commission, they are said, by the An∣cients to have parcelled the World among them: and something like this seems to be insinuated on two several occasions by St. <HI>Paul</HI> himself.</P>
<P>This <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> conveyed by Commission to the Apostles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 10.13. Gal. 2.9.</NOTE> was equally, conferred upon all of them; Whatever Order there was among them, yet no <HI>Superiority</HI> or <HI>Power</HI> of one Apostle above another: Though <HI>Paul,</HI> with respect to his former state, counted himself the least of all the Apostles, being before a Perse∣cutor, and one born out of time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 15.9, 10.</NOTE> as he words it. Yet as to <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Authority,</HI> he owns himself not Inferior even to the <HI>chiefest Apostles.</HI></P>
<P>And as their <HI>Office</HI> was high and emi∣nent, no less were the <HI>Gifts</HI> and <HI>Endow∣ments,</HI> by which they were qualified for
<PB N="18" REF="002417_0024_0FDB3E4A8AB6C470"/>
it: They had been Eye and Ear Witnes∣ses of Christ's Life, Doctrine, Miracles; and besides the benefit of his publick Ministry, had enjoyed the Advantage of his private Converse, and were well ac∣quainted with all the Passages of his Life, at least from his entring into his <HI>publick Ministry,</HI> till the Day of <HI>Ascension:</HI> They were immediately taught and instructed by him in all things, pertaining to the Kingdom of GOD: He had opened their Minds to understand the Scriptures, and endued them with the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> to guide them into all Truth, so that they were infallibly secured from Error, in delivering the Doctrines and Principles of Christianity: And to confirm their Doctrine, they were endued with many <HI>Extraordinary Gifts</HI> and <HI>Powers,</HI> to work Miracles, to heal all manner of Diseases, to cast out Devils, to speak with divers Tongues, to interpret strange Tongues, to foretel things to come, to discern Spi∣rits, to inflict Corporal Punishments on Notorious Sinners; and (which was pe∣culiar to them) they had Power to confer these <HI>Extraordinary Gifts</HI> upon others.</P>
<P>Thus have I given you an account of the Commission by which the Apostles acted, I come now to consider the Com∣mission given to the other Order of <HI>Church Officers,</HI> instituted by Christ, the
<PB N="19" REF="002417_0025_0FDB3E4CC2FEA9A0"/>
<HI>Seventy Disciples;</HI> in whom the <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Presbyters</HI> and ordinary <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teach∣ers</HI> is supposed to be founded: Now, as it is already shewn. They received their Commission immediately from Christ, as well as the Apostles, and were authori∣zed to preach the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and endued with <HI>Extraordinary Gifts</HI> of working Miracles, healing Diseases, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and unto them no less than unto the <HI>Apostles,</HI> Christ said, <HI>He that heareth you, beareth me,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 10.16.</NOTE> <HI>and he that rejecteth you, rejecteth me, and be that re∣jecteth me, rejecteth him that sent me.</HI> So that in their Measure and Proportion, so far as their Commission extended, they were Christ's <HI>Messengers</HI> and <HI>Ambassadors</HI> also, though not in the same <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Quality</HI> with the <HI>Apostles,</HI> as we have seen in part already.</P>
<P>Indeed from the Account we have of them and their Ministry in the Sacred History, we cannot frame a more just and true Notion of this <HI>Second Order</HI> of <HI>Church Officers,</HI> than that they were insti∣tuted to be <HI>Assistants</HI> and <HI>Helpers</HI> to the <HI>Apostles</HI> in the Work of the <HI>Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>And I know nothing which will give us a better Reason for this Notion than this Consideration, that as it was the same <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Law-giver,</HI> the same <HI>Ma∣ster-builder,</HI> who had framed the <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiastical Policy</HI> among the <HI>Jews,</HI> under
<PB N="20" REF="002417_0026_0FDB3E4E98031C28"/>
the <HI>Legal Dispensation,</HI> who does Erect this <HI>New Fabrick</HI> of his <HI>Gospel-Church;</HI> so 'tis reasonable to expect as great a Sym∣metry and Proportion between the one and the other, as the Difference of the two <HI>Dispensations</HI> will allow: And it is the Opinion of many Ancient and Mo∣dern Divines, That our Blessed Lord in many of his <HI>Gospel Institutions,</HI> had some respect to the state of things in the <HI>Jewish Church,</HI> as might be shewed in many In∣stances: And particularly will appear in these Offices, which he instituted in the <HI>Gospel Church,</HI> not only in making them of a <HI>Superior</HI> and <HI>Inferior Order,</HI> as under the <HI>Mosaick Dispensation,</HI> but also, as to the Reason and Design of these different Orders; for after <HI>Aaron</HI> and his Sons were installed in the Priest's Office, GOD gave unto them the whole Tribe of <HI>Levi</HI> to Minister unto them, in the Charge of the Tabernacle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numb. 3.</NOTE> So also, when <HI>Moses</HI> was vexed with the unto∣wardliness of the People, and complain∣ed to GOD of the Weight and Burden of his Charge, and that the Care and Government of such an unruly People was committed to him alone; the Lord orders that <HI>Seventy</HI> Men, of the <HI>Elders</HI> of the People, be chosen and presented be∣fore him at the Door of the Tabernacle,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Numb. 11.</NOTE> and he took of the Spirit that was upon
<PB N="21" REF="002417_0027_0FDB3E5206B9F450"/>
<HI>Moses,</HI> and put it upon them, that they might bear the burden of the People with him, and he might not bear it alone. Now, whether the <HI>Apostles</HI> after their first Progress, returned with any such Complaint of the greatness of their Charge, we read not, except it be insi∣nuated by St. <HI>Mark,</HI> when he says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mark 6.13.</NOTE> That after their return, Christ called them a∣part to a desert Place to rest themselves a while: However, certain it is, our Blessed Lord well knew the greatness of their Work, and shortly after, instituted that other <HI>Order</HI> of Gospel Ministers, the <HI>Seventy</HI> to be Assistants to the Apostles; and accordingly we find the Apostles frequently making use of the Ministry and Assistance of them of that <HI>Second Or∣der,</HI> either taking some of them along with them in their Travels, to Minister unto them in propagating the Gospel among the <HI>Jews</HI> or Heathens; or else fixing them in places where the Gospel was received, and Churches founded; or else in sending them with Apostolick Orders to Churches that were at a dis∣tance: And 'tis probable that according to the different Exercises of their Mini∣stry, they were designed sometimes <HI>Evan∣gelists,</HI> when they laboured in converting <HI>Jews,</HI> or Heathens to the Faith; some∣times <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> when they
<PB N="22" REF="002417_0028_0FDB3E52A605DB30"/>
exercised their Ministry among them that were already converted; and gene∣rally they pass under the Name of <HI>Bre∣thren</HI> and <HI>Elders,</HI> or <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in distinc∣tion from the <HI>Apostles.</HI></P>
<P>From these <HI>different Commissions</HI> given to the <HI>Apostles</HI> and the <HI>Seventy,</HI> 'tis evi∣dent that there was a <HI>Distinction</HI> betwixt their <HI>Offices,</HI> and that the Apostolick Office was Superior to that of the Seven∣ty, which great Truth may also farther be shown by several very weighty Argu∣ments: For although the Apostles did manage the Authority we suppose they had, so much with the Spirit of their Lord and Master, who, though he was their Lord and Master, yet humbled himself <HI>to wash their Feet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">John 13.13.15.15.</NOTE> and treated them rather as Friends than Servants, and be∣haved himself among them as one that served, although they (I say) following his Example,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Luke 22.27.</NOTE> behaved themselves with the greatest gentleness and sweetness of Temper toward their Inferiors seldom making use of their Authority in any se∣vere manner; whereof we have a notable Instance in the Epistle of <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Phile∣mon,</HI> a Minister of the Gospel, where he says,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philem. ver. 8, 9.</NOTE> <HI>Though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoyn thee, that which is convenient, yet for loves sake, I rather beseech thee.</HI> Yet, that they had such Authority over the
<PB N="23" REF="002417_0029_0FDB3E5379AF1AE8"/>
other Pastors and Teachers in the Church, appears from several Instances of their exercising it in several respects and ways, as is recorded in the Sacred History. I shall instance in some particulars in Con∣firmation of this Truth, in the order as they occur to us in Holy Writ.</P>
<P N="1">1. And <HI>First,</HI> we read that the Apostles abode for some time in <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and the Brethren with them (no doubt ac∣cording to some Order given them by their Lord) to settle and establish the Christian Church there; but when the Persecution arose about <HI>Stephen,</HI> all al∣most, except the Apostles, were scatter∣ed abroad through the Regions of <HI>Judaea</HI> and <HI>Samaria: Philip,</HI> one of the Seven Deacons, went down to <HI>Samaria,</HI> preach∣ed the Gospel, wrought Miracles, con∣verted many of that City to the Faith, and initiated his Converts by Baptism: Others went as far as <HI>Phenice, Cyprus,</HI> and <HI>Antioch,</HI> where a great number believed and turned to the Lord: When the A∣postles heard of this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 8.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> are sent to <HI>Samaria,</HI> to confirm and settle the Church there, and to confer upon them the Gifts of the Holy Ghost. For though the Brethren had Power to Preach and Baptize, and Work Miracles, yet it be∣longed to the <HI>Apostles</HI> to settle and esta∣blish
<PB N="24" REF="002417_0030_0FDB3E5865C4CED8"/>
Order in the new founded <HI>Churches,</HI> and to confer the Gifts of the Holy Ghost; <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were also sent to <HI>Antioch</HI> upon the like Errand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 11.22.</NOTE></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Secondly,</HI> We find that when the Apostles went abroad to execute their Commission in <HI>Discipling</HI> the World, they were attended by some of the Brethren, as their Assistants and Ministers: Six attended <HI>Peter</HI> from <HI>Joppa</HI> to <HI>Cesarea,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 10.13.</NOTE> and from thence to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and to them it was that he gave Orders for Baptizing <HI>Cornelius</HI>'s Family; and them he brings as Witnesses for his Vindication, when challenged by them of the Circumcision, for his Converse with the <HI>Gentiles. Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> had <HI>John,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">11.12.</NOTE> surnamed <HI>Mark,</HI> one of the <HI>Seventy,</HI> for their Minister, in their first Progress, who after some time <HI>departed from them,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">12.25.13.5. Verse 13.</NOTE> for which <HI>Paul</HI> is highly displeased with him, and will not admit him again to be one of his Atten∣dants, because he had departed and <HI>went not with them to the Work.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">15.38.</NOTE> This was the occasion of some Contention betwixt <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> which came to that height, that they departed asunder the one from the other; <HI>Barnabas</HI> going to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> attended by <HI>Mark,</HI> his Sister's Son; and <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Cilicia,</HI> attended by <HI>Silas.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="002417_0031_0FDB3E59C65E3FC0"/>As <HI>Paul</HI>'s Province was enlarged, by the Conversion of many Cities and Coun∣tries unto the Faith, the Number of his Attendants and Assistants in the Work of the Gospel did also increase, many accompanied him from place to place, besides these Pastors, whom he settled in every City that had received the Gospel.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> These <HI>Inferior Pastors</HI> were generally very obsequious to the Orders of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> going whither they sent them to Visit planted Churches; coming when they called them, to give their personal Attendance; and serving with them in the Work of the Gospel, as Sons with their Fathers, as <HI>Paul</HI> says of <HI>Ti∣mothy.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 2.22.</NOTE></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> When any of them proved Refractory and Disobedient to the Or∣ders of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> they are blamed for it, and sometimes threatned with Cen∣sures; such were some Teachers at <HI>Co∣rinth,</HI> who despised and decried <HI>Paul</HI>'s Apostleship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 4.18, 19.</NOTE> whom he threatens for their disorderly Conduct with the Apostoli∣cal Rod.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Fifthly,</HI> And when he is giving <HI>A∣postolical Orders,</HI> for Redressing and Re∣forming
<PB N="26" REF="002417_0032_0FDB3E5E5F580858"/>
some Irregularities and Abuses in the Publick Worship, occasioned through the Pride or Impudence of some of their Prophets and Teachers, who (it seems) were too much puffed up with their Spiritual Gifts; he writes to them in an Authoritative Stile; <HI>What?</HI> says he, <HI>Came the Word of God out from you,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 14.36, 37.</NOTE> <HI>or came it unto you only? If any Man think himself to be a Prophet or Spiritual,</HI> Let him <HI>ac∣knowledge that the things that I write unto you, are the Commandments of the Lord, i. e.</HI> that I as an Apostle, have Power from the Lord to give Commandments and Orders in these matters, which concern the decent and orderly Performance of the Publick Worship; but if any be ig∣norant, let him be ignorant. He com∣plains also of others, who <HI>added Affliction to his Bonds, preaching Christ out of Conten∣tion and Strife,</HI> disowning his Apostleship, refusing to receive his Commands; yea walking contrary to his Orders, while others preached Christ out of <HI>Love,</HI> own∣ing his Apostleship, <HI>knowing that he was set for the Defence of the Gospel.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Phil. 1.15, &amp;c</NOTE> And when this holy Apostle's Back was at the Wall, in Prison, and hazard of Death, many who had been formerly his Attendants and Assistants in the Gospel-work, deser∣ted him, when he stood most in need of their Ministry;<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Tim. 4.10,</NOTE> which, he prays, might not be <HI>laid to their charge.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="27" REF="002417_0033_0FDB3E5F88187AB0"/>6. <HI>Sixthly,</HI> In like manner St. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Apostle</HI> complains of one <HI>Diatrephes,</HI> who <HI>affected a pre-eminence</HI> over the Church, disowned the Authority of the Apostle, refused to receive the Orders which he sent to the Church, or the Brethren by whom he sent them; yea, presumptuously took upon him to cast these Brethren, and such who were willing to receive them, out of the Communion of the Church, and to all, added contemptuous and slighting Words of the <HI>Apostle;</HI> whom the <HI>Apostle</HI> threatens, when he comes, to chastise for his Pride and Insolence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">John 3.9, 10</NOTE> in rejecting the Orders of his Superior, and arrogating to himself that Superiority to which he had no Call or Title; for which Malepertness, the Apostle no doubt exercised his Apostolical Power in cen∣suring him, if he did not prevent it by Repentance.</P>
<P>In a Word, through all the <HI>New-Testa∣ment</HI> History, we read of none who op∣posed the <HI>Authority of the Apostles,</HI> but such as were <HI>Hereticks</HI> and <HI>Disturbers</HI> of the Church's Peace, who every while made it their Business to depress the Cre∣dit and Authority of the <HI>True Apostles;</HI> and to gain the more easily Proselites to their false Doctrines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2 Cor. 11.13, 14.</NOTE> they either pretend that they themselves were Apostles, or
<PB N="28" REF="002417_0034_0FDB3E6363BCAA98"/>
else that they themselves were Commis∣sioned by the Apostles, whereas truly they were such as had departed from the Communion of the Apostles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 15.24.</NOTE> as St. <HI>John</HI> tells us.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 John 2.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE> And St. <HI>Jude</HI> gives us this Ac∣count of them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Jude 11.</NOTE> <HI>We unto them, they have gone in the way of</HI> Cain, a Murderer of his Brother, <HI>and ran greedily after the Error of</HI> Balaam, a covetous Wretch, <HI>and have perished in the gainsaying of</HI> Corah, a proud ambitious <HI>Levite,</HI> who disdaining to sub∣ject himself to that Order God had set∣tled in his Church, and Murmuring to be set in a lower Station among the <HI>Le∣vites,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Numb. 16.8, 9, 10.</NOTE> aspired to the Priesthood. Now it is not easy to understand, how these <HI>Hereticks</HI> could correspond with <HI>Corah</HI> in his Sin, if Christ had settled a <HI>Parity among Church-Officers,</HI> and not a <HI>Superior</HI> and <HI>Inferior</HI> Order.</P>
<P>And as all true Pastors and Teachers were faithful and dutiful Assistants and Helpers, with the <HI>Apostles</HI> in the Work of the Gospel, and punctual observers of all Apostolick Orders and Commands: So on the other hand, The <HI>Apostles</HI> pay'd always that respect unto the Pastors, that was due unto their Character, not treat∣ing them as Underlings and Servants, but as Brethren and Fellow-labourers and Helpers, admitting them to all their Consultations about Church Affairs,
<PB N="29" REF="002417_0035_0FDB3E64C4F24028"/>
joyning their Names with their own, in the Apostolical Decrees and Constituti∣ons; yet always, with a clear Indication of Distinction and <HI>Subordination</HI> of their Order unto that of the <HI>Apostles.</HI> Yea,<NOTE PLACE="marg">See Acts 1. and 15. 22, 23.</NOTE> and in some of <HI>Paul</HI>'s Epistles to the Chur∣ches, after that he designs himself the <HI>Apostle of Jesus Christ,</HI> he subjoyns the Names of some of his Brethren, his As∣sistants and Fellow-helpers in the Work of the Gospel. And he does most ear∣nestly recommend to the Church, That they have their <HI>Pastors</HI> in Reputation and Honour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Philip. 2.29.</NOTE> <HI>That they know them that labour among them, and are over them in the Lord, and admonish them, and that they esteem them very highly in love for their works sake.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thess. 5.12, 13. Heb. 13.6. and 17.</NOTE> That they remember their Rulers with Respect, <HI>obey them, and be subject to them.</HI></P>
<P>Notwithstanding which, when his A∣postleship is called in question, or when it is set upon a Level with the <HI>Inferior Order,</HI> with what holy Zeal does he assert the Dignity and Authority of his <HI>Apostleship:</HI> So when the Factious <HI>Corin∣thians</HI> began to slate themselves in Par∣ties, and to set in Opposition, or at least, upon a Level with him, some of their Teachers, saying, <HI>I am of</HI> Paul, <HI>and I of</HI> Apollo: He owns <HI>himself</HI> the Plan∣ter, <HI>Apollo</HI> the Waterer; <HI>Himself</HI> the Mas∣ter-builder,

<HI>Apollo,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 3.6. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> and others, as Builders with him. 'Tis true, in this matter, he but borrows his own Name and <HI>Apollo</HI>'s,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 4.6.</NOTE> as he tells us; for it was far from the Apostles to set up themselves, as Heads of Factions one against another, neither did any of the faithful Pastors, such as <HI>Apollo</HI> was, attempt any such thing. No, it was the turbulent Pastors and Teach∣ers who introduced these Factions, with design, no doubt, to depress the Autho∣rity of the Apostle, and advance their own, and to gain Followers. To correct the Arrogance of these Teachers, who being puffed up with their Spiritual Gifts, durst thus set up themselves in Compe∣tition with, or Opposition to, the Apostle; and the Fickleness and Fondness of the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> their Admirers and Follow∣ers, he represents several things, and an heavy Complaint of the ill Treatment he, and other Apostles, had met with from them. He puts them in mind, that <HI>though they had ten thousand Instructers in Christ,</HI> yet they were obliged to own <HI>him as their Father, who had begotten them in Christ by the Gospel,</HI> and therefore ought to be Followers of him. And if this his Fatherly Admonition did not reclaim them, he threatens both these Factious Teachers and their Abettors with his A∣postolick Rod.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 4.</NOTE> It was upon the same,
<PB N="31" REF="002417_0037_0FDB3E69DD6E83F0"/>
or the like occasion, that we find him with holy Keenness asserting and prov∣ing his Apostleship, magnifying his Of∣fice, boasting of that Authority he had received from Christ, and once and again maintaining that he was not <HI>Infe∣rior to the chiefest Apostles.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 9. 2 Cor. 10, 11, 12, 13. Chapters.</NOTE> To what pur∣pose all this, either their denying his Apostleship, or his strenuously asserting it, if there had not been an <HI>Eminency of Power and Authority</HI> in the <HI>Apostolate,</HI> above the <HI>Ordinary</HI> Pastor and Teacher?</P>
<P>Prophecy, says <HI>Chrysostome,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Serm. de util. S Scrip. Tom 8. pag. 114. Edit. Savil.</NOTE> the Gift of Miracles, the expelling <HI>Demons,</HI> the Order of Pastors and Teachers, were all Spiri∣tual Powers, and Ensigns of great Au∣thority; but the Apostolick Eminency was far greater than all these, which he therefore calls a Spiritual Consulship. An Apostle having as great Pre-eminence above other Officers in the Church, as the Consul had above all other Magistrates in <HI>Rome;</HI> which is allow'd by <HI>Calvin,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inst. Lib. 4. Cap. 4. Sect. 2.</NOTE> who acknowledges a Bishop to be, <HI>ut Con∣sul in Senatu,</HI> as Consul in the Senate.</P>
<P>Thus, I think, I have done with what I propos'd to make appear in the Second Place, having demonstratively shown how the Gospel-Officers were distinguish∣ed, and that there was a Disparity among them.</P>

<P>And this is the Hinge on which the whole Controversy in this matter de∣pends, yea, all the Authority and Obli∣gation of Christ's first institution, as to the present Church; for if his Institution was Extraordinary and Temporary in any part, it is so far as it was of this Nature, no Rule or Standard now: But if the Order he instituted was to be per∣petual and standing, then it continues Obligatory to the end of the World; and it must be to all Christians, what the Pattern in the Mount was to <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Jews,</HI> a constant Standard by which the Church is to be moulded and framed in all After-Ages: I shall there∣fore impartially examine into this mat∣ter.</P>
<P>And, 1st, it is acknowledged by all, that many of the Gifts and Powers where∣with both Apostles, and other Pastors were endued, were <HI>Extraordinary</HI> and <HI>Temporary,</HI> being designed only, as the Apostle says of Tongues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 14 22.</NOTE> <HI>for Signs,</HI> to con∣vince Unbelievers of the Divinity of that
<PB N="33" REF="002417_0039_0FDB3E6C0A3D0C48"/>
Doctrine which they saw attested by such <HI>Miraculous Operations:</HI> But the Gospel-Doctrine being once sufficiently attested and confirmed, there was no further need of continuing them, and they have long since ceased in the Church.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, 'Tis also acknowledged, that some things <HI>peculiar</HI> to the first <HI>Apostles,</HI> were <HI>Extraordinary</HI> and <HI>Temporary,</HI> and expired with their Persons. Such as, Their hav∣ing been eye and ear Witnesses of Christ's Life, Doctrine, Miracles, Sufferings, Re∣surrection and Ascension. Their having received their Commission immediately from Christ. Their being infallible Guides in delivering the Doctrines of the Gos∣pel. Their unlimitted Commission to all the World, and Jurisdiction over all Churches. Their Power to confer mira∣culous Gifts on others, to discern Spirits, and to back their Censures with corpo∣ral Punishments, as on <HI>Ananias</HI> and <HI>Sa∣phira</HI> and <HI>Elimas:</HI> and perhaps, to these may be added their power to institute new Gospel Officers and Ministries, as the exigence of the Church should re∣quire; as they did that of <HI>Deacons.</HI> All these extraordinary Powers and Gifts, whether they which were peculiar to the Apostles, or such as were common to them and other inferiour Ministers, had
<PB N="34" REF="002417_0040_0FDB3E6EF707CC90"/>
a particular respect to the first planting of the Gospel, and the erecting and con∣stituting of the Christian Church in the World: which when performed, these extraordinary Powers ceased: but,</P>
<P N="3">3dly, Besides these, There was the or∣dinary Power and Authority of the A∣postles, which was to serve the Edifica∣tion, good Order and Government of the Constituted Church in all succeeding Ages: Such as, Their power to preach the Gospel, administer the Sacraments, and perform all the Offices of Religion, common to them with other Pastors. More particularly, to preserve the Offices instituted by Christ in his Church, by ordaining Ministers of Religion in all the three distinct Offices: To Govern the Churches, and superintend both Pastors and People: To Judge, Correct and Cen∣sure Misdemeanors either in the one or other: To settle good Constitutions agreeable to the Word of God, for the orderly and decent performance of all the Ordinances of Religion, Publick Worship and other Affairs of Discipline, as the exigence of the Church should require: And finally, By their Authority and Care, to preserve the Church from the Cor∣ruptions of Error, Superstition, Faction, Schism, and Prophaness, by their right
<PB N="35" REF="002417_0041_0FDB3E70BB371A78"/>
use of the Keys and the Power of bind∣ing and loosing committed to them: All which are proper parts of the Apostolick Office, always necessary for the good of the Church; and no part more necessa∣ry than their Authoritative Inspection, over the ordinary Pastors, that they be well qualified for the Pastoral Office be∣fore they be admitted thereto, and when admitted, they perform the same, with Faithfulness and Diligence, with Prudence and Discretion, and in Peace and Con∣cord with their Brethren. Now, these things being premised, I come to an im∣partial Examination of the matter in hand.</P>
<P>And here I must needs confess I think there is nothing more evident upon the slightest Examination than that Christ in Instituting these Orders and Offices, de∣signed, that they should be standing and unalterable Constitutions in his Church, to continue for its Edification to the end of the World: And of none, is the un∣alterableness of Institution more evident, than of the Apostolick Office, (which some contend to be temporary and ex∣traordinary.)</P>
<P>For 1st, When Christ gave them their full and last Commission, He enjoyns them to teach all Nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mat. 28.19.</NOTE> whom they should Disciple, to observe all things
<PB N="36" REF="002417_0042_0FDB3E724076F138"/>
whatsoever he had <HI>commanded them,</HI> of which the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Offices,</HI> he had in∣stituted, were a part, which accordingly they were to settle in all new founded Churches: And then he adds, <HI>Lo I am with you alway to the end of the World:</HI> But how could that be, if their Office was to expire with themselves? We must then understand it, as a promise, not to them only, but to their <HI>Successors</HI> also: not to their <HI>Persons</HI> only, but to their <HI>Office,</HI> which was to continue to the end of the World, even so long as Christ was to have a Church upon Earth.</P>
<P N="2"><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 12.28.</NOTE>2dly, The Apostle S. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, <HI>God hath set some in his Church, first Apostles, secondly Prophets, thirdly Teachers</HI> (what follow, are not distinct Offices from these, but extraordinary Gifts conferred on them.) <HI>God hath set,</HI> even He, who settled the Ordinances of Heaven, which none can alter, hath fixed these different Orders in his Church: or rather, to use the Apostles Simile, as God hath set va∣rious and different Members in the natu∣ral Body, some more excellent and ho∣nourable, yet, all useful and necessary to the Beauty and Integrity of the whole; he has done the same by his Church: So that whoever would deprive the Church of any of these Sacred Offices set
<PB N="37" REF="002417_0043_0FDB3E73B8AA8FB0"/>
in it by God, endeavours no less than to mutilate and deform it, to pluck out one of its Eyes, or cut off one of its Hands: And how heinous the Guilt must be, so to treat the Body whereof Christ Jesus is Head, let them consider who presume to do it.</P>
<P>But farther, Thirdly, in the 4th Chap∣ter of the Epistle to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 4.11, 12, 13.</NOTE> we have an uncontestible Testimony, prov∣ing the perpetual continuance of these Offices instituted by Christ, taken from the end and design for which they were instituted: <HI>He gave some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, some Pastors and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying the Body of Christ, till we all come in the unity of the Faith and of the Knowledge of the Son of GOD unto a perfect Man, unto the Measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Ver. 14.</NOTE> That we henceforth <HI>be no more Children tossed to and fro, and carried about by every wind of Doctrine, by the slight of Men and cunning Craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive:</HI> Where it is plain, these Offices were to continue till the Church should be perfected, fully brought in, and fully advanced, and till it should be beyond all hazard of being seduced, that is, <HI>to the end of the World.</HI> We see the end
<PB N="38" REF="002417_0044_0FDB3E7762A27868"/>
for which these Offices were Instituted, and how long they were to continue, expresly set down.</P>
<P>If any say, That here are more Offices than are pleaded for: The Answer is obvious, that these different Designations do not import different Offices, but dif∣ferent Exercises of the same Office: For Instance, an Apostle, Presbyter or Dea∣con, might be a Prophet, Evangelist, Doctor or Teacher. If employed in converting Jews or Heathens to the Faith, he did the Work of an Evange∣list, and on this Account <HI>Philip,</HI> one of the seven Deacons, is so call'd. If in In∣structing them who were already Con∣verted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 21.8.</NOTE> that was the Work of an <HI>ordinary Pastor:</HI> If he laboured mainly in explain∣ing and confirming the Doctrines of Christanity, he acted the Part of a <HI>Doc∣tor</HI> or <HI>Teacher:</HI> If he further improved these Doctrines to Edification, Exhorta∣tion and Comfort, that was the Work of the <HI>Prophet,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Cor. 14.3. Acts 15.32.</NOTE> in the Gospel Sense. Thus <HI>Judas</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> two Presbyters, are called <HI>Prophets;</HI> so that all these are reducible to the three Offices, of whose Institution we have given a particular Account.</P>
<P>And now, if these different Orders of Gospel Ministers instituted by Christ, were designed by him to be perpetual standing Offices in his Church, for its
<PB N="39" REF="002417_0045_0FDB3E783A666C98"/>
Edification, good Order and Government, <HI>to the end of the World,</HI> as is evident from what hath been said; there must of Ne∣cessity be a Succession of Persons, duly called to these Offices, according to Christ's Institution, that the Offices them∣selves may be capable of continuing standing in the Church.</P>
<P>And to erect and set up a new Office Paramount to these instituted by Christ, such as the <HI>Papacy,</HI> is intolerable Pre∣sumption; for who can have a Power and Authority in the Church above <HI>A∣postles</HI> who were Christ's immediate De∣legates, but Christ himself?</P>
<P>And it is no less Presumption to cut off, or abrogate any of these Sacred Of∣fices: 'Tis an overturning that Order established by Christ in his Church, and altering and changing his Institution: It is a Sacrilegious Robbing the Church of these Ministers which Christ in his in∣finite Wisdom thought necessary for her Edification and Perfection. You know what a dreadful Curse is pronounced a∣gainst them, who either add to, or take away from, the Institutions of Jesus Christ in the 18th and 19th Verses of the 22d Chapter of the <HI>Revelations</HI> of St. <HI>John.</HI></P>
<P>If it be pretended, that now at least, in the present State of the Church, both
<PB N="40" REF="002417_0046_0FDB3E7DD57E26C8"/>
the <HI>Apostolick</HI> and <HI>Prophetick Offices,</HI> may be, to as good Purpose, and as great Be∣nefit of the Church, performed by the <HI>ordinary Pastors,</HI> acting in <HI>Parity,</HI> and that it is therefore needless to keep a distincti∣on of Offices: This is to pretend to be wiser than Christ: It is to confound and jumble together the different Orders in∣stituted by him: It is to set up a new Model different from what he not only established, but also appointed to conti∣nue in his Church to the end of the World; it is to cashier Christ's <HI>prime Officers</HI> and <HI>Representatives,</HI> and the Chur∣ches <HI>principal Guides:</HI> And to deprive the Church of the Pledges of her Lord's Care and Kindness which he gave her, when he Ascended up unto Heaven.</P>
<P>If then our Blessed Lord's Institution be preserved, there must be <HI>Apostles,</HI> as well as <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> who are not disputed, that is, Successors to them in their Office in the Christian Church: And who are they? Sure, not every <HI>Pas∣tor,</HI> nor yet any number of them, how∣ever moduled into lesser or larger Judi∣catories: I Honour their <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Office,</HI> but would not have them take too much upon them, nor go beyond their Sphere: They are indeed the <HI>Successors</HI> of the <HI>Se∣venty,</HI> if duly admitted to the <HI>Pastoral Office,</HI> and may well rejoyce in that
<PB N="41" REF="002417_0047_0FDB3E7F2FC03670"/>
honourable Station to which they are advanced in God's Church, if they Walk worthy of it; but let them remember, that the Whole <HI>Seventy</HI> could not fill the Chair of one <HI>Apostle,</HI> (for no Man may take this Honour to himself, but he that is called of <HI>GOD</HI>) until the Holy Ghost did determine the Choice of one to that High Office: I doubt not, but there were upwards of seven hundred Eminent Pa∣stors, and all endued with <HI>Extraordinary Gifts,</HI> in the Days of the Apostles: But <HI>were all Apostles?</HI> Says St. <HI>Paul,</HI> No, they, were not.</P>
<P N="4">IV. Which brings me to what I pro∣mis'd in the <HI>Fourth</HI> and <HI>Last</HI> Place, to shew, supposing these Church-Offices to be standing, who succeed in them, and rightly execute them to this Day.</P>
<P>I need but do it of the Successors to the Apostles, for when that is done, the other comes in of Course.</P>
<P>And in clearing this Point, I must put you in mind of what was observed under the foregoing Head, That the <HI>Apostles</HI> were endued with some Powers and Gifts, which had a peculiar Reference to the first Planting and Propagating the Gos∣pel, and the first Gathering and Consti∣tuting the Christian Church: These were <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> and did expire with them∣selves; and in these they have no Succes∣sors.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="002417_0048_0FDB3E82610742E0"/>But the question is concerning the <HI>Or∣dinary Power and Authority</HI> of the Aposto∣lick Office, as it was instituted and ap∣pointed by Christ, to be a standing and continuing Office in his Church when constituted, to serve for the Edification, good Order and Government thereof to all succeeding Ages: The Apostles were an Order of the Gospel-Ministers, Supe∣rior to Ordinary Pastors and Teachers, to whom Christ in a special Manner committed the Care and Government of his Church: To dispense the Word and Sacraments, and perform all Offices of Religion: To Ordain Ministers of Reli∣gion according to his Institution: To Govern and Superintend his Church both Pastors and People: To Judge, Correct, and Censure Misdemeanors in the one or other: To settle good Orders and Constitutions for the orderly and decent performance of all Ordinances of Reli∣gion, Publick Worship, and Exercise of Discipline, and to preserve the Church from Corruption of Error, Superstition, Faction, Schism, and all Irregular Pra∣ctices. All these are proper Parts of the <HI>Apostolic Office,</HI> always necessary for the good of the Church; and they are also the proper Officers of a <HI>Bishop, Overseer</HI> or <HI>Superintendent.</HI> So that 'tis very evident, that in this ordinary and continuing Part
<PB N="43" REF="002417_0049_0FDB3E8379F85CD0"/>
of the Apostolick Office, Christ hath in∣stituted the standing Office of <HI>Bishops</HI> in his Church, that is an Order of Gospel-Ministers, Superior to Pastors and Teach∣ers, to whom he hath committed the Power and Authority above-mentioned.</P>
<P>That the <HI>Apostles</HI> were actually <HI>Bishops,</HI> and their <HI>Apostleship</HI> a proper <HI>Episcopacy,</HI> as it is expresly called, <HI>Acts</HI> 1.20. and that they actually exerted an <HI>Episcopal Power</HI> and <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> over the Churches, and the ordinary <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers, Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> I have fully shew∣ed in the Second Inquiry. And accor∣dingly we find the Ancients do frequent∣ly in their Writings call the <HI>Apostles, Bi∣shops;</HI> and no less frequently do they stile the <HI>Bishops Apostles,</HI> as being their Successors in ordinary; by which 'tis evident, they understood, that in the <HI>A∣postles,</HI> the <HI>Episcopal Office</HI> was instituted, and that in <HI>Bishops</HI> the <HI>Apostolical Office</HI> is continued in the Church: But this is beyond my Province, having confin'd my self in this Inquiry, to what Light the Sacred Records afford.</P>
<P>And in consulting them we find it evi∣dent, <HI>First,</HI> That the <HI>Apostles</HI> were a <HI>Supe∣rior Order</HI> of Gospel-Ministers to <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Ordinary Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers:</HI> That to these Apostles Christ Committed the chief Care &amp; Government of his Church, as his special and immediate Delegates and
<PB N="44" REF="002417_0050_0FDB3E872620A690"/>
Trustees: That the <HI>Inferior Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> did always own and acknow∣ledge the Apostles as their Superiors, and did readily receive and obey their Orders: That this <HI>Apostolick Order,</HI> Superior to <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> was to continue in the Church: all which we have fully cleared from Scripture in the former En∣quiries. Now, what Order of Gospel-Ministers is there, <HI>Superior to Ordinary Pa∣stors and Teachers,</HI> but that of <HI>Bishops,</HI> in whom the Apostolick Order is continued in the Church?</P>
<P>Either then <HI>Bishops</HI> must be the true Successors of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> or else they have no Successors at all, and the <HI>Aposto∣lick Order</HI> and <HI>Office</HI> is quite Extinct, and the Church is totally deprived of the prime and chiefest Office instituted by Christ for its Edification, good Order and Government: And finally, There is now no such Order of Men extant in the World, to whom that large and ample Commission which Christ gave only to his <HI>Apostles,</HI> does belong: To them it was he gave the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, the Power of Binding and Loosing: Them he sent as his Legates and Ambassadors to the World, as the Father had sent him: Them he instru∣cted in, and entrusted with the great Affairs of his Kingdom, and to them he
<PB N="45" REF="002417_0051_0FDB3E88C9017F08"/>
made that encouraging and gracious Pro∣mise, <HI>Lo, I am with you alway, even to the end of the World.</HI> Now, who can lay Claim to that Commission, or the Pro∣mise annexed, but the <HI>Apostles</HI> and their <HI>Successors?</HI> And if they have no Succes∣sors now, that they themselves are Dead, all that Commission falls, and the Pro∣mise with it; which is absurd to think, and 'tis horrid even to conceive what consequences would follow.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> It is evident also from Scrip∣ture, That the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their own time did confer upon other; the <HI>Apostolick Power and Authority;</HI> which they had never done, if they had thought that the Office was confined to their own Persons, and was to end with their respective Lives: They understood better the Mind of their Lord and Master, and the Importance of his Promise, to be with them <HI>to the end of the World.</HI> Hence they rightly conclu∣ded, That they were to commit the Com∣mission given to them, unto the Hands of other faithful Persons, who should in like manner transmit it to others in a continual Succession, <HI>to the end of the World.</HI> Accordingly their first Work was to chuse one to succeed <HI>Judas;</HI> and by the Direction of God, <HI>Matthias</HI> is recei∣ved into the number of the Apostles: So when <HI>James,</HI> the Brother of <HI>John,</HI> is
<PB N="46" REF="002417_0052_0FDB3E8C36AA1848"/>
killed by <HI>Herod,</HI> another of that Name was Bishop of <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> to whom as such,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 12.17.</NOTE> St. <HI>Peter</HI> notifies his miraculous De∣liverence. He who presided in the Coun∣cil at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 15. Acts 21.18.</NOTE> He to whom St. <HI>Paul</HI> made his Address when he came thither: and he of whom he speaks in the 19th Verse of the first Chapter of the Epistle to the <HI>Galatians,</HI> whom he calls an <HI>Apo∣stle,</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Brother:</HI> This <HI>James</HI> some will have to be another, than <HI>James,</HI> commonly called <HI>the Less,</HI> one of the first Twelve Apostles; that he was one of the <HI>Seventy,</HI> commonly called <HI>James the Just,</HI> advanced to the <HI>Apostolate;</HI> but however this be, certain it is, That <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were received into the <HI>Apo∣stolick Office,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 26.16.</NOTE> <HI>Paul</HI> immediately called thereunto by Christ at his Conversion. But <HI>Barnabas</HI> in the ordinary manner, when he received that new Name from the Apostles,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Acts 4.36, 37.</NOTE> which signifies <HI>Son of Conso∣lation.</HI> Both of them owned afterwards by the Apostles, <HI>James, Peter,</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> as their Fellow Apostles; and in Testi∣mony thereof, they gave them the Right hand of Fellowship,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Galat. 2.9.</NOTE> and a particular Com∣mission to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>Besides these we read of others rais'd from among the Ordinary Pastors to the Apostolical or Episcopal Order; and en∣dued with a Power and Authority over

Churches, and their Pastors and Presby∣ters; (under what Designation I shall not dispute, inasmuch as the thing is evident∣ly Matter of Fact) for after this manner, <HI>Paul</HI> actually gave to <HI>Timothy</HI> such an <HI>Episcopal Power</HI> over the Church of <HI>Ephe∣sus,</HI> and the Presbyters and Pastors there∣of; by vertue of which Commission, he is Authorized and Instructed in all the Exercise of the <HI>Episcopal Power.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Tim. 1.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> To Com∣mand and Charge them, (the Pastors) that they Preach sound Doctrine:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 2.</NOTE> To prescribe Rules for the Publick Worship, particularly, that Prayers be offered up for all in Authority: To examine and judge Persons duly qualified for the Sa∣cred Offices of the Gospel,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Chap. 3.

Chap. 6.13, 14.</NOTE> <HI>I charge thee before God, that thou observe these things without partiality or preferring one before an∣other.

<P>These are such evident Proofs of an <HI>Apostolical</HI> or <HI>Episcopal Power</HI> conferred upon one <HI>Pastor</HI> over other <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> as ought in Reason to satisfie all Men who are not immediately pre∣judiced against the <HI>Episcopal Order.</HI> I will not contend, but that in the <HI>Exercise of this Power,</HI> they may have taken the Ad∣vice and Concurrence of the Faithful <HI>Pastors</HI> in these Churches, and concerted Affairs with them: and not done things in an Arbitrary and despotick manner, as <HI>Calvin</HI> observes; Yet he allows they

<P>If it be said, That <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> acted only as <HI>Paul</HI>'s Delegates, it weakens not the Argument, but rather corroborates it, for it still holds that there was in the <HI>Apostles,</HI> a <HI>Superior Power and Office,</HI> above that of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> which might be con∣ferred upon and committed to another, whether by Delegation, or by Investiture and Ordination of the Person into the Office, to which that <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Authority</HI> belonged, comes all to one. It is to as little purpose to say, that <HI>Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> exercised this Power and Authori∣ty over the Pastors of <HI>Ephesus</HI> and <HI>Crete,</HI> as <HI>Evangelists:</HI> for 1. If the <HI>Power</HI> was really <HI>Apostolical</HI> and <HI>Episcopal,</HI> 'tis all one under whatever designation they exerci∣sed it; But 2dly, 'Tis altogether ground∣less; for we find no such Office of an <HI>Evangelist</HI> instituted, distinct from that of <HI>Apostle, Presbyter,</HI> or <HI>Deacon,</HI> but that it was a common designation to all who were the first Planters of the Gospel a∣mong <HI>Jews,</HI> or <HI>Heathens,</HI> which can∣not hold in the present case, for their Commission is not only to the unconver∣ted Heathens at <HI>Ephesus</HI> or <HI>Crete,</HI> but to the Churches already settled, and Pastors instituted, in the actual Exercise of their
<PB N="50" REF="002417_0056_0FDB3E94C3C20170"/>
Ministry in these places over whom they are charged to exercise this <HI>Episcopal Au∣thority,</HI> as they will answer to <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> the Supreme <HI>Lord</HI> of his <HI>Church.</HI></P>
<P>And what hath been hitherto observed, makes it to me, very evident, and I think may make it to any other unprejudic'd Person at least highly probable, That the <HI>Angels</HI> of the <HI>Seven Churches</HI> of the lesser <HI>Asia,</HI> were Persons of the <HI>Apostolical</HI> and <HI>Episcopal</HI> Order: For since there was such an Office of <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Bishops</HI> instituted by Christ in his Church, whose Office was to Superintend Churches and the Pastors thereof, and by their Authority to settle good Order, to prevent and cor∣rect Abuses and Corruptions in <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>People:</HI> Who else could these <HI>Angels</HI> be, but Officers of this higher Order? Who therefore are accountable for, and charged Particularly with, any Disorder or Corruption tolerated in their respec∣tive Churches: And commended for suppressing and correcting these Disor∣ders, and Purging their Churches of Heretical Teachers.</P>
<P>And, Finally, we cannot entertain the least Doubt of it in our Minds, but that the <HI>Holy Apostles,</HI> to whom our Lord gave special Commission and Power, to Plant and Settle, and Govern his Church in his Name, would be most faithful and exact,
<PB N="51" REF="002417_0057_0FDB3E998EF82B28"/>
in settling that Order, and Instituting these Offices, in all fully constituted Churches, which their Lord had appoin∣ted; and would be careful to leave the Church at their Death, under the same Order and Government, furnished with the same Offices and Ministers which Christ himself her Lord, had instituted and appointed for her Edification.</P>
<P>Neither can it be conceiv'd, that any. Christian Church could look on herself as rightly Constituted, if any of these sacred Offices instituted by Christ and his Apostles had been wanting.</P>
<P>And now, having plainly from uncon∣testible Matters of Fact, Recorded in the New Testament, represented the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Government,</HI> the different Offices and Powers instituted by <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Apostles,</HI> in the first modeling of the Christian Church; I might add for Confirmation of all that has been hitherto alledg'd, that all the Records we have of the <HI>Ancient</HI> and <HI>Primitive Church</HI> do harmoniously attest, That this <HI>Order,</HI> and these <HI>Offices</HI> instituted by Christ, were inviolably pre∣served for many Ages; and so positive are they, as to that <HI>prime Office</HI> of <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Bishops,</HI> that they give us particular Catalogues of the Bishops who succeeded the Apostles, in governing the most fa∣mous and principal Churches in the
<PB N="52" REF="002417_0058_0FDB3E9ACDF8E398"/>
World: But to insist on this, would force me beyond the Bounds within which I propos'd to contain my self in my first Entrance upon this Subject.</P>
<P>I shall therefore only give the Testi∣mony of <HI>Calvin</HI> in this Matter, because perhaps his Authority may go further with some, than that of the Ancients: You will find it in the 1st and 4th Sections of the 4th Chapter of his Institutions, where treating of the State of the Church, and the Form of its Government before the Papacy, he says to this purpose: <Q>It will be useful in this Matter, to know and consider the Form of the Ancient Church, which will represent before our Eyes, a certain Image of the Divine Institution: Although the Bishops of those Times, framed many <HI>Canons,</HI> by which they seem to strain Things be∣yond what is expressed in Holy Writ; yet with that Caution did they frame all their Order and Government, ac∣cording to the only Rule of God's Word, that you may easily see they had almost nothing in this Matter disagreeable to the Word of God. Yea, though some∣thing might be wanting in their Order, yet, because with a sincere Study they endeavour'd to preserve God's Institu∣tion, and erred not much from it, it will be very profitable, briefly to re∣count
<PB N="53" REF="002417_0059_0FDB12B38E1F8638"/>
what kind of Custom they had. As we have shown, there is a threefold Ministry commended to us in Scrip∣ture; So whatever Ministers the ancient Church had, it distinguished them into three Orders, <HI>Bishops, Presbyters,</HI> and <HI>Deacons.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And §. 4. <Q>That every Province had among their <HI>Bishops,</HI> one who was an <HI>Arch-bishop,</HI> and that in the Council of <HI>Nice,</HI> Patriarchs were appointed, who in Order and Dignity might be supe∣rior to <HI>Arch-bishops;</HI> This was for Pre∣servation of Discipline, that if any thing happened in any Church which could not well be determined by a few, it might be referred to a <HI>Provincial Sy∣nod,</HI> and if the Affair were of such Importance that it required a greater Discussion, Application was made to the <HI>Patriarch</HI> with the Synods, from whom there was no Appeal, but to a <HI>General Council:</HI> The Government thus constituted, some did call an <HI>Hierarchy,</HI> a Name improper (as seems to me) surely not used in Scripture; for the Holy Spirit would provide, that in the Matter of Church-Government, None might Dream of a Principality or Do∣minion; but if laying aside the Name, we view the Thing it self, we will find that the ancient Bishops had no mind
<PB N="54" REF="002417_0060_0FDB3E9E9521E598"/>
to frame any other Form of Church Government, than what was prescribed by God in his Word.</Q> <HI>Thus far</HI> Calvin.</P>
<P>And I would conclude with these Words, but that I am obliged, for further clearing what hath been hitherto obser∣ved, to consider some Passages of Scrip∣ture that are commonly objected against what I have advanc'd.</P>
<P>And, <HI>First,</HI> 'tis alledg'd, that the Names of <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter</HI> are promiscuously used in Scripture, and therefore they sig∣nifie but one and the same Office: It is Answered by some, That this is a great Mistake: And that wherever <HI>Bishops</HI> are named, we are to understand <HI>Bishops</HI> pro∣perly so called, and not <HI>Presbyters,</HI> which they make appear from the Texts brought in favour of the Community of Names; for Instance, <HI>Acts</HI> 20.27, 28. They say, <HI>Paul</HI> called both <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> un∣to him, and that the Clergy of all the Cities thereabout were there; for <HI>Paul,</HI> during his three Years abode in <HI>Asia,</HI> had Conversed with the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> of other Places, than of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and his appealing to their Knowledge,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Verse 18.</NOTE> proves that they were present, so that what he says, <HI>ver.</HI> 28. was principally directed to the <HI>Bishops,</HI> and secondarily and by way of Reflection to the <HI>Presby∣ters.</HI> To <HI>Titus</HI> 1. Ver. 5, 6, 7. it is an∣swer'd,
<PB N="55" REF="002417_0061_0FDB3EA0037BC8E0"/>
That what is there to be found, only proves that he should Advance the <HI>Presbyters</HI> under him, and Ordain <HI>Bishops,</HI> and Dispose of them unto Cities, fixing them to certain Cures; so it follows, <HI>for a Bishop must be blameless,</HI> &amp;c. There were Presbyters before at <HI>Crete,</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> was to ordain some of them <HI>Bishops:</HI> So 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3. is to be understood of Bishops <HI>properly so called,</HI> that were to be ordained to pre∣side over other Cities, as <HI>Timothy</HI> did over <HI>Ephesus. Phil.</HI> 1.1. may be understood of the Bishops of <HI>Philippi,</HI> and other neigh∣bouring Cities, who were wont to con∣vene and meet together; or it may mean that <HI>Paul,</HI> and the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> that were with him, Salute the Saints at <HI>Philippi.</HI> This Answer however not obvious to every one, yet clearly shews how uncertain that alledged Identity of Names is.</P>
<P>But though we should not look upon this Answer as absolutely conclusive, but grant an Identity of Names; yet it will not follow, that there was an Identity of Offices; for Names are common in Scrip∣ture, where Offices are acknowledged to be distinct. Thus <HI>Hebrews</HI> the 3d and the 1st, Christ is called an <HI>Apostle;</HI> and 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.25. he is called a <HI>Bishop;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 5.1. John, Ep. 2.3. 1 Cor. 3.5. 2 Cor. 3.6. Col. 4.7, 17.</NOTE> <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> call themselves <HI>Presbyters;</HI> and the <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Pastors</HI> are frequently called
<PB N="56" REF="002417_0062_0FDB3EA19AC93168"/>
<HI>Deacons.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Thes. 3.2.</NOTE> Now it cannot from thence be argued, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> Office was one and the same with the <HI>Deacons:</HI> The Name of the <HI>Genus</HI> is usu∣ally given to the <HI>Species:</HI> The Superior Office including the Inferior, all <HI>Apostles</HI> were <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons,</HI> though not <HI>vice versa:</HI> Therefore the Identity of Offices is not to be argued from the Iden∣tity of Names: for according to the Pres∣byterians themselves, the Name <HI>Presbyter</HI> is common to the Pastor, and Ruling Elder, yet the Offices are vastly distinct.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> several Texts are addu∣ced, in which 'tis alledged, That <HI>Parity</HI> among Church-Offices is <HI>peremtorily</HI> com∣manded; such as Matth. 20.26. <HI>The Lords of the Gentiles,</HI> &amp;c. and the parallel places, <HI>Luke</HI> 9.47, 48. <HI>Luke</HI> 22.24. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 5.3. To which 'tis answered in general, That these Scriptures cannot by any just Rules of Interpretation be understood as con∣demning a Disparity among Gospel Mi∣nisters, nor a Superiority of one Order above another; nor a more eminent Power and Authority in some to Govern the Church above others; nor all Ju∣risdiction of one Gospel Office above others, but only that, which is exercised with imperious Bitterness and Domina∣tion; nor are they interpreted to any such purpose by any Judicious Person of
<PB N="57" REF="002417_0063_0FDB3EA4A77ACFC0"/>
either Perswasion: So that it is not fair, honest, or ingenuous Dealing, in any to make use of these Texts, as condemning <HI>Imparity</HI> among Gospel Officers, in order to amuse the <HI>Populace</HI> and Simpler Sort, who are oft-times soon taken with the Sound of Words, without considering the true Sense and Importance of them.</P>
<P>But to answer this Objection more particularly, 1st, That only is forbidden Gospel-ministers, which was practised by <HI>the Lords of the Gentiles,</HI> that is, Secular Dominion and Authority; and it was certain, it was this that the Disciples had in their View, when they contended who should be greatest; for they were migh∣tily possessed with the <HI>Jewish</HI> Opinion, that Christ's Kingdom was to be a Tem∣poral Kingdom; and it is this mistake that Christ removes.</P>
<P N="2">2dly, That Dominion which the Lords of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> exercised, was not one over another, but over their Subjects, so that if it take away all Power of one above another, it will destroy the Power of Mi∣nisters over their Flocks: Now, though <HI>Lording over God's Heritage</HI> is expresly dis∣charged;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1 Pet. 5.3. Heb. 13.7.17.</NOTE> yet the <HI>Pastors Power and Autho∣rity over them,</HI> is expresly asserted, where they are called Rulers, and the People commanded to obey them: It would also destroy the Power of Synods and Presby∣ters,
<PB N="58" REF="002417_0064_0FDB12B1D7EB65D8"/>
where Ministers rule over Ministers.</P>
<P N="3">3dly, There are in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> some Ex∣pressions, which plainly imply a Supe∣riority or Eminency of Power, in some over others, when it is said, <HI>He that is greatest among you:</HI> And when Christ pro∣poses his own Example in what he there enjoyns them, saying, <HI>I am among you as one that ministreth;</HI> yet none will doubt he was their Lord and Superior, so that the command of Ministring takes not away the Superiority and Power.</P>
<P N="4">4thly, It cannot be thought that our Saviour condemned a Disparity among Gospel Ministers, when it is so evident that he actually instituted Ministers of dif∣ferent <HI>Offices</HI> and <HI>Degrees,</HI> first <HI>Apostles,</HI> then <HI>Seventy</HI> others of a Second Order; and his Apostles instituted a Third Order of <HI>Deacons,</HI> who 'tis certain was Inferior to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as these were to the <HI>Apostles.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5thly, If our Lord had designed to for∣bid all <HI>Disparity</HI> or <HI>Subordination</HI> among the Ministers of the Gospel; 'tis like, he would rather have stated the Opposition between them and the Ministers of Reli∣gion under the <HI>Mosaick</HI> Dispensation, and not the Lords of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Thirdly,</HI> whereas that Passage in the 1st of <HI>Timothy,</HI> the 4th Chapter, and 14th Verse, is brought to prove, That Presbyters have a Right or Power to or∣dain
<PB N="59" REF="002417_0065_0FDB3EA9E7697270"/>
Presbyters, and other Gospel Mini∣sters: It is answered, That place proves no such Thing. For S. <HI>Jerome,</HI> a zealous As∣serter of the Rights of Presbyters, acknow∣ledges that Ordination belongs, if not <HI>solely,</HI> yet <HI>chiefly</HI> to Bishops. And both Ancients and Modern, and among these, <HI>Calvin,</HI> understand Presbyter in the afore∣said Place, not of the <HI>Consessus</HI> or <HI>Collegium Presbyterorum,</HI> the Assembly or Consistory of Presbyters; but of the <HI>Munus</HI> or <HI>Office it self,</HI> or the Ordination of the Office of a Presbyter; so that the Laying on of the Hands of the Presbyter signifies no more than when he was ordained a Pres∣byter; as if St. <HI>Paul</HI> had said, Take heed that the Grace conferred on thee, when I ordained thee a Presbyter,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Calv. Instit. Lib. 4. Cap. Sect. 16. ad finem.</NOTE> be not in vain: Thus <HI>Calvin</HI> interprets that place; and what confirms this Gloss, is the <HI>Karisma,</HI> or <HI>Gift</HI> spoken of, seems to have respect to these extraordinary Gifts conferred by the <HI>Laying on of the Hands of the Apostles</HI> in the Ordination of Pastors, to which the Assistance and Concurrence of others was not necessary.</P>
<P>But granting that <HI>Presbytery</HI> is to be understood of the meeting of Presbyters, yet it will not prove that they had full Power and Authority to Ordain; for here, at the most they did but concur and as∣sist in the Ordination of <HI>Timothy,</HI> as is
<PB N="60" REF="002417_0066_0FDB3EAB486D8FF0"/>
evident from 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6. where the Apostle calling him to stir up that Gift, says, that it was conferred on him <HI>by laying on of Hands.</HI> Certain it is, that Apostles did Ordain without the Con∣currence of Presbyters; but I read not that ever Presbyters ordain'd without an Apostle or Bi∣shop; and in an Action of that Nature and Im∣portance, it may at least be a just ground of Doubt and Scruple, that there is no Warrant or Precedent to be found for it in Scripture, with∣out which I know not how any can be fully per∣swaded in his own mind. How far an absolute necessity may alter the case according to the common Axiom, <HI>That many things may be lawful for a Senate when they have no King, that are not when there is one,</HI> I shall not determine.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="conclusion">
<HEAD>CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>AND now having finished what I design'd at present, that is, having demonstrated from the Scripture's Account of these Matters, what was at first settled in it, and having thence deduc'd what is at present the true Form of Go∣vernment in the Church of Christ: I shall only add, by way of <HI>Conclusion,</HI> a short Expostulation, in the Spirit of Meekness and Love; and calmly enquire, What is the Ground of all that Noise and Clamour, Hatred and Prejudice, raised a∣gainst them who are of the Principles, as to the Point of Church Government, which are here asserted?</P>
<P>'Tis evident we own Christ Jesus the Lord,
<PB N="61" REF="002417_0067_0FDB3EAF3218D828"/>
Head, King, and Lawgiver to his Church, who hath Power and Authority to settle and establish Order and Government therein, and to insti∣tute and appoint what Offices, and in what manner he pleases, in his Spiritual Kingdom.</P>
<P>We are fully perswaded, that He, who is of Infinite Wisdom and Goodness, hath disposed all Affairs relating to the Government of his Church, in the most excellent method, in the way and manner that tends most for the Peace and Unity, Order and Security, Edification and Salvation of his Church and People.</P>
<P>We find, plainly and expresly, Three distinct Offices instituted by Christ and his Apostles; one Prime and Chief, the <HI>Twelve Apostles;</HI> and two Subordinate, the <HI>Seventy Disciples,</HI> and Seven <HI>Deacons:</HI> These Three Orders of Gospel-Mini∣sters are unquestionably of <HI>Divine Institution</HI> and Appointment. And we cannot find in all the <HI>New Testament,</HI> that any of them was <HI>Extraordi∣nary</HI> and <HI>Temporary;</HI> no, not the least Insinuation to move us to think, that after a short time any of them was to cease. On the contrary, we have the same Evidence for their perpetual Du∣ration, that we have for their first Institution.</P>
<P>And now let any impartially Judge, who do most truly assert Christ's Kingly Office, and the Prerogatives of his Crown? They who plead for his Institution, and closely adhere thereunto, and to the Offices which he hath appointed in his Church; or they, who make bold with his Institution; to abrogate the <HI>prime Office</HI> he in∣stituted,
<PB N="62" REF="002417_0068_0FDB3EB079C67F30"/>
as how long since antiquated and out of use; and that only upon a false and ground∣less Supposition, that it was <HI>Extraordinary</HI> and <HI>Temporary.</HI> The falseness of which I have al∣ready shewed under my Third Head, and shall now represent briefly of what a dangerous con∣sequence it is to Religion, to alledge that any of the Offices instituted by Christ, were <HI>Extra∣ordinary</HI> and <HI>Temporary,</HI> appointed only to serve the <HI>Infancy</HI> and <HI>First Constitution</HI> of the Church, but not to continue in it when once constituted. This makes the Rule and Standard of our Reli∣gion uncertain and unfixed, and opens a Gap to all Errors: At this rate, and upon the same pretence, <HI>Quakers,</HI> and others, cast off the Gospel Institutions, of <HI>Holy Orders, Baptism</HI> and <HI>the Lords Supper,</HI> &amp;c. for, say they, these were only <HI>Tem∣porary Ordinances;</HI> but now all the <HI>Lord's People are Holy,</HI> they are all Prophets, the Manifestation of the Spirit, which is given unto all, hath out∣dated all these <HI>Rudimentary Elements.</HI></P>
<P>If any, thus principled, could but gain such an ascendant over the <HI>Populace,</HI> as to inspire them with this Notion, and thereby influence them as much against the Order of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as they have been against that of <HI>Bishops;</HI> What should then become of Order in the Church, or any Gospel Ordinance? God forbid! That any such wild Caprice should ever seize on Christian People; but I make the Supposition to represent thereby the dangerous Consequence of that Principle, <HI>That some of Christ's Institutions were but Temporary:</HI> For it may be improved as much, and on as good
<PB N="63" REF="002417_0069_0FDB3EB26252D998"/>
ground, against the Office of a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> yea, against the positive Instructions of the Gospel, as against the Office of a <HI>Bishop;</HI> and there may come such an unhappy Jun∣cture, when one as well as another, and all as well as one, may thus come to be thought unnecessary. For alas, if the Truth may be told, 'tis greatly to be feared, that not only the Office of <HI>Bishops,</HI> but of all <HI>Pastors,</HI> yea, all the <HI>Sacred Institutions of Christ,</HI> are become intolerable unto too many <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, who want but a favourable Opportunity to vent their minds, and say, <HI>Come, let us break their Bonds asunder, and cast away their Cords</HI> from us.</P>
<P>How will they be able to answer God, or their own Consciences for it? Who have solemnly combined toge∣ther to ruin and overthrow that Order, settled by Christ in his Church, and have left no Stone unturned, in their restless Endeavours, to bring the Sacred Offices of <HI>Bishops,</HI> and <HI>Pastors</HI> Ministring under their Inspection and Govern∣ment, into perpetual Contempts; and having industriously set themselves to oppose and frustrate all their Gospel Ad∣ministrations; and not only to alienate the Minds of poor simple People from their <HI>Lawful Governours</HI> and <HI>Pastors,</HI> but with Noise and Clamour, and bitter Invectives, to in∣spire them with the highest Rage and Fury to commit the most horrid Outrages on their Sacred Persons, as good Service done to God; and all upon no other Ac∣count, but their firm adherence unto the Institution of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Father forgive them, they know not what they do: Lord lay not this Sin to their change, but mercifully open their eyes, that they may see the evil of their ways, and may be converted to the Way of Truth and Godliness, Peace and Charity, Unity and Or∣der, and Eternall, Saved: Through Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI> Now unto GOD the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, be Glory Everlasting. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
