<HEAD>GOD will not Destroy a Penitent People.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>JER. XVIII. 7, 8.</HI></BIBL>
<P>At what instant I shall speak concerning a Nation, and concerning a Kingdom to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it: If that Nation against whom I have pro∣nounced, turn from their Evil, I will re∣pent of the Evil that I thought to do unto them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN this Chapter, 1. We have a Declara∣tion of God's <HI>Sovereign Power</HI> to deal with a People as He pleaseth, under the <HI>Parable</HI> or Similitude of a <HI>Potter</HI> and his <HI>Clay,</HI> ver. 1,—6. If the Potter hath power over his yellow Clay to fashion it as he will; surely that God, who hath given being to us and all Creatures, may dispose of us as seemeth good in His sight, Rom. 9.
<PB N="2" REF="002958_0004_0FE6A61D2C4CE588"/>20, 1. <HI>Nay but O man, who art thou that repli∣est against God? shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay—?</HI> 2. God shews that in his Dealings with Nations, He acts as a <HI>righteous Judge;</HI> yea as a God gracious and merciful, <HI>ver.</HI> 7,—10. At what instant—God speaks against a People when He threatens to bring desola∣ting Judgments upon them, and 'tis implied that this is for their Sins, whereby they transgress His holy Laws: This is the ground of the Controversy. Notwithstand∣ing, we are here assur'd that tho' a sinful People give God cause to come out against them, so that if He should mark iniquity they could not stand; yet He is not wont to deal with them in a way of rigorous Justice; but first threatens and warns, be∣fore He comes out against them to destroy them: Yea, that if they take the Warning, and turn from the Evil of their Sins unto unto Him; God will also repent of the Evil of Punishment He threatned to bring upon them, and stay His Hind. Not as if God chang'd His Mind, or alter'd His Decree. No! He is the Almighty, All-wise, and Unchangeable God. <HI>I am the Lord, I change not</HI>—Mal. 3.6. God is of one mind, and who can turn Him? God can do nothing but what is worthy of His infinite Perfecti∣ons,
<PB N="3" REF="002958_0005_0FE6A5E8B699C0B0"/>and therefore He can't Repent in a strict and proper sense, 1 Sam. 15.29. <HI>The Strength of Israel will not Repent</HI>— He is not a Man that He should Repent. However, God is said to Repent, speaking after the manner of Men, when He changeth His way, and the Course of His Providence towards a Person or People, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.6. <HI>Jon</HI> 3.10. A∣greeably, the Expression here us'd intends that God would not execute the Judgments denounced, nor bring the threatned Evil up∣on them; but <HI>e c.</HI> would return unto them in a way of Grace and Favour. On the o∣ther hand, God shews that His Promises of prospering and establishing a People are Conditional, ver. 9, 10. <HI>If it do Evil, I will repent of the good</HI> — God will stop the Course of His Mercies, and walk con∣trary to them. Now the due Observance of these Rules would help us to understand the Justice, Truth and Equity of God's Pro∣vidential Dispensations towards His ancient People, and others. 3. We have the Im∣provement of the foregoing Discourse with an <HI>especial Application</HI> to God's Covenant People the Jews, ver. 11,—17. In which the <HI>Prop et</HI> is commanded to declare to the Men of <HI>Judah,</HI> that God was framing Evil against them; and then to call them to Re∣pentance and Amendment of life, <HI>ver.</HI> 11. But their obstinacy in siuning is foretold,
<PB N="4" REF="002958_0006_0FE6A61D479D3800"/>and they are upbraided with their folly in forsaking their Covenant God, <HI>ver.</HI> 13,—15.4. We have an account of the People's des∣perate resolution to plot mischievous De∣vices against <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> because he faithfully delivered God's Message to them, <HI>ver.</HI> 18. <HI>ad sin.</HI> And then an Imprecation of Judg∣ment, in which the Prophet was not acted by an evil spirit of personal Revenge: He desir'd not the <HI>woful Day;</HI> but by the Spirit of Prophecy.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Text, from which, and as related to the Context, I shall ob∣serve these Doctrines.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>GOD is wont to Threaton a People, and give them Warning before He brings Destroying Judgments upon them.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>IF they Repent of the Evil of their Sins, and turn from them to the Lord; God will also Repent, and not bring the threatned Evil of Punishment upon them.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>BUT if a People when thus Threatned go on obstinately in their Sins, they may expect that God will bring His Destroying Judgments upon them till they are made Desolate.</HI></P>

AT what instant I speak, to pluck up — God utters His Voice in dreadful Threat∣nings before He gives the fatal blow. He causeth the Woe-Trumpets to sound before He pours out the Vials of His Wrath. Thus God threatned the Sinners of the Old World, and yet spared them One Hundred and Twenty Years before He brought the Flood upon them to destroy them, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6.3,—7 In which time <HI>Noah</HI> was a Preacher of Righteousness, and the building the Ark a sign. Yea the great Prophet and Teacher, our LORD JESUS CHRIST, is said to Preach to those Sinners, whose Spirits are now in Prison, 1 Pet. 3 19, 20 <HI>By which also he went &amp; preached unto the spirits in prison: Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long suffering of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is eight souls were saved by water, In or by which</HI>—i. e. <HI>His God Head,</HI> which is an eter∣nal Spirit. <HI>Noah</HI> was but an Instrument in His Hand. God early denounc'd dreadful Threatnings against the <HI>Israelites</HI> upon Con∣dition of their Revolt and Apostacy, Lev 26.14. — 34. — <HI>If ye shall despise my statutes —I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies.</HI> ver. 21. <HI>And if ye work contrary to me — I will bring seven times more plagues upon you — your Land shall be desolate &amp;c.</HI> And thus God sent the Pro∣phet
<PB N="6" REF="002958_0008_0FE6A6269C9A6728"/><HI>Jonah</HI> to the <HI>Ninevites,</HI> tho' they were not his peculiar Covenant People, with that Message, Chap 3.4. — <HI>Yet forty days and Nineveh shall be overthrown</HI> Notwithstand∣ing which, God had spating Mercy in re∣serve for them. Now, God doth thus threaten, and speak against a People,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IN and by His Word.</HI> Herein God's Wrath is reveal'd from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of Men. God threatens His degenerate People by His Word in the mouths of His Ministers, Hos. 6.5. <HI>I have hewed them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth.</HI> Tho' Men were the Instruments in Writing, or Pronouncing these Threatnings; yet they wrote and spake as mov'd and inspir'd by the Holy Ghost, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 1.21. And therefore this Word is to be received not as the Word of Men; but as indeed it is the Word of God. <HI>Thus faith the Lord.</HI> And this Word of God abideth in full force and virtue throughout all Generations, 1 Pet. 1.24, 5. <HI>All flesh is as grass</HI> — <HI>But the word of the Lord endureth for ever.</HI> It not only concerns those to whom it was nextly directed; but all to whom it comes, and they may <HI>assure</HI> themselves that if their Case be the same it will take place on them. Rom. 15.4. <HI>Whatsoever things were written aforetime, were written for our Learning.</HI> And thus
<PB N="7" REF="002958_0009_0FE6A5F385F861A0"/>the Punishments recorded in Scripture, are said to be <HI>our Examples,</HI> — 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.6. In them we do as in a <HI>figure</HI> behold the truth and faithfulness of God in fulfilling His Word. Sinners must therefore realize it that the Threatnings of God's Word are denounced against them as truly as if their Names were mentioned. <HI>Thou art the Man.</HI> And if they continue impenitent they shall find it so in the Day of the Revelation of the Righteous Judgment of God, when as many as have sinned <HI>in the law,</HI> shall be judg∣ed <HI>by the law,</HI> i. e. the written Word. Rom. 2.12. All must <HI>hear what the Spirit faith to the Churches,</HI> Rev. 2.7.</P>
<P N="2">2. GOD speaks <HI>against</HI> a People <HI>by His Providential Dispensations.</HI> When together with the Threatnings of His Word, He stretcheth out His Hand to smire them. There's a <HI>Voice</HI> in the <HI>Rod,</HI> and by it God says, Turn at my Reproof, <HI>Mic.</HI> 6.9. The Lord's Voice crieth unto the City — <HI>hear ye the Rod</HI> — When God in His Providence threatens to bring desolating Judgments on a backsilding People, and then stays His Hand; or when He brings lighter Chas∣tisements, and in Judgment remembers Mercy, so that they are not concerned; He then gives a People warning, and says, <HI>Pre∣pare to meet thy God</HI> —. Or as Lev. 26.23, 4. <HI>And if ye will not be reformed by these things,
<PB N="8" REF="002958_0010_0FE6A626B2968BD8"/>but will walk contrary unto me: then will I also work contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.</HI> By such jud cial Dispensations, God calls to a Peo∣ple to strand in Awe of Him; to Repent and turn to Him, when His Wrath is kind∣led but a little, and begins to burn. The Voice of <HI>Christ,</HI> to whom all Judgment is committed, is that, Joh. 5.14. <HI>Sin no more, lest a worse thing come unto you.</HI> Don't go on to provoke me, lest I bring utter ruin upon you.</P>
<P>USE. I. LEARN from what hath been said, <HI>The Mercy, Patience and Forbearance of God.</HI> Surely. He doth <HI>not afflict willingly, nor grieve the Children of Men,</HI> Lam 3.33. Judgment is his <HI>strange Work.</HI> Isa. 28.21. And he doth not usually proceed to it, till he hath tried other means, and given his People fair Warning. Neh. 9.17. Thou art a God ready to Pardon, <HI>Gracious and Merciful, slow to Anger.</HI> — and for sookest them not. God endureth with much long suffering, even the Vessels of Wrath — <HI>Rom.</HI> 9.22. He is the God <HI>of Patience.</HI> Rom. 15.5. And when he proclaims His Name, one Letter in it is that, <HI>Long suffering,</HI> Exod. 34.6, Sometimes when His Hand hath been lift∣ed up ready to give the deadly Blow, His Bowels of Compassion have moved Him to stay His Hand, Hos. 11, 8, 9. <HI>How shall I
<PB N="9" REF="002958_0011_0FE6A5F39CEEAD60"/>give thee up Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me — I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim; for I am God, &amp; not man,</HI>— O let us then give God the Glory of these Divine and amiable Perfections! Let not us despise the Riches of His Goodness and Forbearance and Long-suffering, not know∣ing that the Goodness of God leadeth to Repentance. Let us not after our hardness and impenitent Hearts treasure up to our selves Wrath against the Day of Wrath, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2 4, 5. But,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>LET us take the Warning God gives us, and Turn unto Him.</HI> Let not any of us encourage and harden our selves in Sin be∣cause God may have threatned again and again, and yet hath not brought the deserv∣ed Destruction. Sinners are very prone to this pernicious and provoking Evil, Eccl. 8.11. <HI>Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily; therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.</HI> O take heed of this Presumption and Secu∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>y! It is often a presage of Ruin. Prov. 29.1. <HI>He that bring often reproved, Lardneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</HI> O take the warning then which God gives you in his Word and Pro∣vidence,
<PB N="10" REF="002958_0012_0FE6A6284ACBBBA0"/>and turn to Him without Delay. Now that God says to us, as Ezek. 33.11. <HI>Say unto them, As I live, saith the Lord God, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live: turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways: for why will you die, O house of Israel;</HI> Let us relent, and without delay make our Peace with God thro' Jesus Christ. Let us as a People take the Warning; Hear and obey God's Voice in His inflicted and threatned Judgments. Let us Repent, and put away the Evil of our Doings, that God may Repent of the Evil, and not bring it upon us. Which leads me to the</P>

<P><PB N="11" REF="002958_0013_0FE6A5F4BB01AEB0"/>
Answ. 1. IT supposeth, <HI>That they are truly and generally Convinc'd of the Evil and Danger of their Sins.</HI> Sin is the worst of Evils: the <HI>wages</HI> of it is <HI>Death,</HI> Rom. 6.23. But alas! Such is the Power of deceitful Lusts, to blind Mens minds, that they flatter themselves in their own Eyes. <HI>Psal.</HI> 36.2. Agreably there is a woe denounced against those that <HI>call Evil Good, and Good Evil;</HI> that put Darkness for Light — <HI>Isa.</HI> 5.20. Wicked Men whose understanding is dark∣ness, have wrong notions of God, of Sin, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For in their Practical Judgments, they pre∣fer the gratification of their Lusts before the enjoyment of God. The old Man is Corrupt according to Deceitful Lusts; so that while a Person or People are under the governing influence of Sin, they do not make a right Judgment concerning the Nature and pernicious Consequences of this Dead∣ly Evil. But when God gives them Re∣pentance, he sends his Spirit to Convince them of Sin, making them to see and know that it is, <HI>an evil and bitter thing that they have forsaken the Lord their God.</HI> Such a people, are brought to consider and realize it, that they have Dishonoured God, and Wounded themselves, by their Iniquities. God says to them. Thou hast <HI>fallen by thine Iniquities,</HI> Hos. 14.1. Thou hast destroy'd thyself; and his Word is quick and power∣ful,
<PB N="12" REF="002958_0014_0FE6A62862D651D8"/>carrying Light and Conviction with it, when set home by his Spirit. So that they are brought to say, as Job 33.27. <HI>I have sin'd, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not.</HI> Yea, they are convinced that this is the procuring Cause of the Ca∣lamities they suffer, and are brought to determine it must be forsaken, or it will be their ruin. Before they might be ready to attribute their Miseries to other Causes; but now God makes them know that their Iniquities have seperated between them and their God, <HI>Isai.</HI> 59.2. His Voice to them is that, Jer. 4.18. <HI>Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee, this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine heart.</HI> And they are made sensible that Sin is the accursed thing which troubleth them. Such a Con∣viction as this is given by the Spirit of God, commanding the Blessing on the Calls of His Word and Providence, when a Peo∣ple attend to this great Duty of Repen∣tance. The saving Convictions made on God's Children are reviv'd; so that they awake out of their sleepy frames, and be∣come active and vigorous in promoting the necessary Work of Reformation. Others have good Impressions made upon them, which the Spirit of God fastens and makes preparatory to saving Conversion. And
<PB N="13" REF="002958_0015_0FE6484469768468"/>tho' there may be many at such a time that fall short of this; yet even of these there are not a few who are so convinced in their Consciences of the evil and danger of Sin, that they outwardly Reform, and do many things
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mark 6.20.</NOTE>. Destruction from God is such a terror to them that they dare not commit those gross Sins which they before allowed themselves in
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 2.20.</NOTE>, nor omit those Religious Duties they before liv'd in the neglect of.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT supposeth that <HI>they inwardly grieve and mourn for their Sins whereby they have dishonoured and provoked God.</HI> In true Re∣pentance, Sin which was before lov'd and delighted in, is loathed and hated; and inasmuch as it is an evil present, this ha∣tred is expressed in hearty Sorrow upon the account of it, 2 Cor. 7.10. <HI>Godly Sor∣row worketh Repentance.</HI> The true Penitent mourns heartily because he hath offended so great and glorious, so good and gracious a God, by his Iniquities. He looks unto <HI>Jesus</HI> his Compassionate Saviour, considers how his Iniquities have pierced Him, and kindly relents, yea mourns bitterly. A∣greably it is Prophecied, that when God would pour out the Spirit of Grace upon the House of <HI>David,</HI> and upon the Inhabi∣tants of <HI>Jerusalem; They should look upon him whom they had pierced, and mourn, as one
<PB N="14" REF="002958_0016_0FE6A5DBA1B31340"/>mourneth for an only son</HI>—, Zech. 12.10, 12. The Land shall mourn—. And this is what God calls his backsliding People to, Joel 2.12, 13. <HI>Therefore now saith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart, and with weeping, and with mourning. And rent your heart and not your garment, and turn unto the Lord your God.</HI> Agreably, when a People are bro't to Repentance, there's a general Mourning and Sorrow upon the ac∣count of their Sins; they are affected with grief, and their Souls are wounded within them under the terrible Apprehension of the evil and danger of Sin. And tho' all do no not mourn after a <HI>godly sort,</HI> because they have offended God, and vexed. His Holy Spirit; yet there are many who do thus <HI>sigh and cry for all the abominations done in the midst of them,</HI> Ezek. 9.4. And others have Sin so imbittered to them, that they can't take pleasure in it, as they us'd to do; but abstain at least from the out∣ward Commission; so grievous are the pains, and so sore the wounds of their Consciences.</P>
<P N="3">3. WHEN a People are Penitent, <HI>they Confess their Sins before the Lord, &amp; solemnly engage to forsake them.</HI> Such a People do not seek to cover and extenuate their Sins; do not go on to justify themselves, and complain of God, as if he dealt hardly with them. As they, Ezek. 18.25. Ye say,
<PB N="15" REF="002958_0017_0FE6A5D89527C968"/><HI>the way of the Lord is not equal.</HI> But they justify God in all the Evils He brings upon them, and acknowledge that they are pu∣nished less than their Iniquities deserve. Thus they give Glory to God, when they Repent, taking shame and blame to them∣selves. Accordingly, this is named as one ingredient of Repentance, <HI>Lev.</HI> 26.40. If they shall <HI>Confess their Iniquity,</HI> and the Iniquity of their Fathers—. And we find that God's ancient People attended this duty when brought to Repentance, Judg. 10.10. <HI>And the children of Israel cried unto the Lord, saying, we have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our God, and also served Baalim.</HI> And thus the Seed of Israel stood and <HI>confessed their Sins,</HI> — Neh. 9.2. When this good Spirit prevails among a People, they will be ready to confess with <HI>Ezra,</HI> Chap. 9.6. <HI>O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face to them, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our head.</HI> And with <HI>Daniel,</HI> Chap. 9.5. <HI>We have sin∣ned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled by departing from thy judgments.</HI> ver. 7. <HI>O Lord, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us confusion of faces, as at this day.</HI> ver. 8. <HI>O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face: to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against thee.</HI> Their Petitions for Par∣don
<PB N="16" REF="002958_0018_0FE6A62CC2FFF990"/>and Favour will be accompanied with such penitent Confessions: yea, they will solemnly <HI>engage to forsake their Sins</HI> where∣by they have dishonoured and provoked God. When God is pleading the Quarrel of His Covenant with them, they will not only confess their Violations of it; but also, as they may be call'd, be ready afresh to enter into God's Covenant and Oath, that they will forsake those Sins which appear to be the Sins of the times wherein they live. Thus God's People did on a so∣lemn <HI>Fast,</HI> Neh. 9.38. <HI>We make a sure Co∣venant, and write it, and our princes, levites, and priests, seal unto it.</HI> Chap. 10.29. <HI>They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entred into a curse, and into an oath to walk in God's law, which was given by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the command∣ments of the Lord our God, and his judgments, and his statutes.</HI> And in particular, they en∣gag'd to watch against some Iniquities that had prevail'd among them. Agreable to this, A <HI>Venerable Synod</HI> of our own have observ'd, <Q>We seldom read of any Solemn Reformation, but it was accomplished this way, as the Scripture doth abundant∣ly declare and testify
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Result of Synods, p. 112.</NOTE>.</Q> I would here ask leave with all humility to express my desires that this Duty might be again so∣lemnly
<PB N="17" REF="002958_0019_0FE6A5F4D96ED958"/>attended by these Churches. But to return, All I shall further say under this Head is, that where Repentance is sincere, our Confession of Sin will be <HI>free</HI> and <HI>inge∣nuous,</HI> flowing from an afflicting sense of the dishonour done to God, and an hearty desire to give Glory to Him. The Con∣fession of such is not extorted, as <HI>Judas,</HI> when under the rack of a tormenting Con∣science, said, <HI>I have sinned,</HI> Mat. 27.4.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>A Penitent People humble themselves un∣der God's Threatnings, and Submit to Him.</HI> The pride and stubbornness of their Spirits are subdued, that they dare no longer con∣tend with God, being convinced of the truth of that Word, <HI>Wo to him that striveth with his Maker,</HI> Isai. 45.9 They now fall down at God's foot, and resign themselves to His Sovereign Will, being ready to ac∣cept the punishment of their Sins, and wil∣ling to be reconciled to God upon His own terms, Lev. 26.41. —<HI>If then their uncir∣cumcised hearts be humbled, and they then ac∣cept the punishment of their iniquity.</HI> Such a People are of a broken and contrite Spirit under the Tokens of God's displeasure a∣gainst them, submit to Him, and are more concerned to have their Sins and God's Anger removed, than to be delivered from outward Calamities. Before they might refuse to receive Correction; but now they

<P N="5">5. A Penitent People <HI>Turn from their Evil Ways, and Return to the Lord their God.</HI> Thus a People's Repenting is express'd in the Text by <HI>turning from their Evil,</HI> i. e. the Evil of Sin, which is the worst and the only Evil that stirs up God's holy displea∣sure <HI>against</HI> a Person, or Nation. The true Penitent not only confesseth, but also for∣saketh his Sin. <HI>Prov.</HI> 28.13. There's a turning from Sin in inward <HI>Aversion</HI> to it, and an hearty endeavour to put it far away as the abominable thing he hateth. Agre∣ably, Repentance is called Repentance <HI>from dead works, Heb.</HI> 6.1. i e. Sins, which are dead Works; for they proceed from the body of Death in us, and if persisted in, end in Death. Sin when it is finished bringeth forth Death. Accordingly, it is not enough that a degenerate People sanctify Fasts, confess their Sins, and promise Amendment. No! they must forsake them and reform, or they do not Repent, Ezek. 14.6. <HI>Say unto the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God, Repent and turn your selves from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations.</HI> There must be a fixed Reso∣lution, by the help of God, to abandon our
<PB N="19" REF="002958_0021_0FE6A5E777AFE3D0"/>Sins, and this must be put in execution: The Wicked must forsake their Thoughts, and evil Ways. As the Children of Israel, <HI>put away the strange gods</HI> from among them, and served the Lord: and His Soul was grieved for the misery of <HI>Israel,</HI> Judg. 10.16. We must not hold fast our Iniquities, refu∣sing to let them go; but must break off our Sins by Repentance. We must in our se∣veral Places seriously engage in the Work of Reformation. <HI>Civil Rulers</HI> in their Pla∣ces must lead in this necessary Work, im∣proving their Authority to suppress those Evils which threaten the Destruction of their People, as they provoke God to de∣part from them; they must endeavour to turn away Wrath, by being a Terror, not to Good Works, but to the Evil. Thus King <HI>Josiah, put down the Idolatrous Priests, &amp;c.</HI> 2 King. 23.4, 5. The <HI>Ministers of the Gospel</HI> must in their Places bear due Testimony against the Sins of a backsliding People, Isai. 58.1. <HI>Cry aloud, spare not; lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob their sin. lieads of Families</HI> must endeavour to put all Iniquity far from their Tabernacles; and put <HI>Joshua</HI>'s Resolution in practice; As for me, and my House, <HI>we will serve the Lord.</HI> Particular Persons must be sensible of the Plague of their own Hearts, and seek to
<PB N="20" REF="002958_0022_0FE6A62CE2908E78"/>God their Saviour to convert and heal their Souls. In a word, the <HI>Body of a People</HI> must hear and obey God's Voice, in Isai. 1.16, 17. <HI>Wash ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your ways and doings from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, Learn to do well</HI> —. It was said even of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> Jon. 3.10. <HI>God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way</HI>—. I would hope some of them were so taught the knowledge of the true God, and of the only way of Salvation by the promised Messiah, that they sincerely repented, and were eternally saved. How∣ever there must be, as there was among them, an outward prevailing Reformation of those hainous Evils for which God threatens Destruction. And upon this, we find God hath spar'd a finful People; as the <HI>Nenevites;</HI> and His Covenant People <HI>Israel,</HI> delivering them from those publick Cala∣mities which threatned their ruin; tho' it appear'd afterwards by their speedy A∣postacy, when the Judgments were removed, that the generality of the People were not thoroughly reformed, not sted fast in God's Covenant. Upon the account of which, God again and again turn'd against them, and punished them seven times for their Iniquities. So that in order to a People's obtaining lasting Peace in the enjoyment of God's especial Favour and Blessing, it is
<PB N="21" REF="002958_0023_0FE6A5F8B3C75F00"/>needful that they be generally sincere in their Repentance, &amp; thorow in their Refor∣mation. In which there is an hearty Turning from all known Sin, as it is contrary to the revealed will &amp; declarative Glory of God, and a returning to that One God, who is the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost, as to our highest End and chief Good; as to our Lord and Portion; to walk in His Ways, and keep all His Commandments, 1 Kin. 8.48. <HI>And so return unto thee with all their heart, and with all their soul.</HI> There must be such a Repentance <HI>towards God,</HI> Act. 20.21. Such a turning to the Lord, <HI>Chap.</HI> 11.21. if we wou'd hope, as a People, to enjoy the continued shines of God's face, and the peculiar Tokens of His favour. The Power of Godliness must take place among us in the general Establishment of pure and undefiled Religion, in Doctrine, Worship and Manners. Now, such a Repentance and Reformation as this, must be the especial <HI>Work</HI> of the <HI>Spirit of God</HI> poured out upon a People, in His Divine Gifts and Graces, Ezek. 36.26, 7. <HI>A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them. And ye shall dwell
<PB N="22" REF="002958_0024_0FE6A630BAD2EDF0"/>in the land that I gave to your fathers, and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. I will also save you from all your uncleannesses, and I will call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine upon you. And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the field, that ye shall receive no more re∣proach of famine among the heathen. Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings that were not good, and shall loath your selves in your own sight, for your iniqui∣ties, and for your abominations. Not for your sakes do I this, faith the Lord God, be it known unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house of Israel. Thus saith the Lord God, in the day that I shall have cleansed you from all your iniquities, I will also cause you to dwell in the cities, and the wastes shall be builded. And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate in the sight of all that possed by.</HI> Chap. 39.29. <HI>Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord God.</HI> The Spirit of God is the Dis∣penser of the saving Blessings purchased by our Lord Jesus Christ. O that this comprehensive Blessing might be bestow'd on us, and the whole Israel of God! Lord save thy People, and bless thine Inheri∣tance, seed them and lift them up for ever.</P>

II. <HI>IF a People thus Repent, God will also Repent, and not bring the threatned Evil upon them.</HI></P>
<P>GOD often Threatens a People and Warns them with a gracious Design of De∣livering them, by Awakening and so Re∣forming of them, &amp;c. But I now proceed to make some brief <HI>Improvement</HI> of what hath been already d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ered.</P>
<P>USE, I. LEARN that <HI>GOD's ways are equal, and his dealings with Nations, as well as particular Persons, are Righteous.</HI> Though God is Sovereign, God over All; yet He doth not use an Arbitrary Power, and Ab∣solute Sovereignty in Punishing the Chil∣dren of Men. No! <HI>The Judge of all the Earth doth right:</HI> He proceeds in Judgment according to known and establish'd Rules of Righteousness, and makes it appear that Justice and Judgment are the Habitation of his Throne. <HI>Psal.</HI> 89.14. God could Appeal to his People. Ezek. 18.25, — 29. <HI>Hear now, O house of Israel, Is not my way equal? Are not your ways unequal? When a righteous man turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and dieth in them; for his iniquity that he hath done, shall he die. Again, when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedness that he hath committed, and doth
<PB N="24" REF="002958_0026_0FE6A5F8D66C8E08"/>that which is lawful and right, he shall save his soul alive. Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that he hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die. Yet saith the house of Israel, The way of the Lord is not equal. O house of Israel, are not my ways equal? Are not your ways unequal?</HI> Yea, when God was about to Destroy <HI>Sodom</HI> &amp; <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> He says, speaking after the manner of Men, Gen. 18.21. <HI>I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not, I will know.</HI> And righteous <HI>Lot</HI> was remarkably deliver∣ed from the Overthrow. There's none of God's Dispensations towards the Children of Men, but what may be fairly accounted for from a due Consideration of the Cove∣nant of Works which God at first entred into with <HI>Adam,</HI> "not only for himself, but for his Posterity"; of the Covenant of Grace, and of the State of Mankind, as the World is under the Government of our Lord Jesus Christ, God-Man-Mediator. If there be any perplexing Difficulties to us, these must proceed from the darkness and weakness of our own minds. God's righ∣teousness is like the great Mountains, even when his Judgments are a great Deep. <HI>Psal.</HI> 36.6. Let us then give God the Glory of his Justice and Rectoral Holiness, ac∣knowledging
<PB N="25" REF="002958_0027_0FE6A5FB54FE7F18"/>that he is clear when he judgeth. And let not Sinners take up Pre∣judices against God, as if he dealt hardly with them; But rather Condemn them∣selves, and in a believing Penitent manner, seek to be Reconcil'd to him, for <HI>he is gra∣cious and mercisul, and repenteth of the Evil.</HI></P>
<P>Which leads me to</P>
<P>USE II. <HI>LET us all be Exhorted to Repent, and turn to the Lord, that He may Repent of the Evil, and Spare us.</HI> God is this Day Calling us to Humble ourselves under his Amazing Judgment, whereby He threatn'd to send us down quick into the Pit, when he terribly shock the Earth. And what reason have we to fear before Him, when we consider our many provoking Sins, and the Tokens of God's Anger in the Course of His Providence? God hath known us above most of the Families of the Earth, and therefore may Visit us for our Iniqui∣ties; which have been committed against shining Light, and Covenant Bonds. There hath been great Contempt cast on Jesus Christ, and His great Salvation, while many have appeared to prefer the World, and their Lusts before Him: Great Opposition to the Spirit of Grace, while formality in Religion hath sadly prevailed; yea
<PB N="26" REF="002958_0028_0FE6A630D64C6F60"/>many have been profane and vicious, God's Ordinances, His House, His Day, have not been valued as they should have been. There have also been Scandalous Immorali∣ties found among us, as Injustice, Op∣pression, Intemperance, Uncleanness, &amp;c.— And alas? we have seem'd, till this late surprising Providence, to be in a dreadful measure unconcern'd under our Sins, and the awful withdrawments of God from us. Few comparatively have appear'd to lament after the Lord, and to stir up themselves to take hold of a departing God. Nor have we been duly Affected with the fore∣going Dispensations of Divine Providence, in which there hath been a wonderful mix∣ture of Judgment and Mercy. I might here remind you of some of them. God hath drawn the <HI>Sword</HI> of the Wilderness to plead the quarrel of his Covenant; but now grants us a good measure of <HI>Peace</HI> and Quietness. He hath threatned &amp; afflicted us with Scorching <HI>Heat</HI> and <HI>Drought;</HI> and yet in a good measure <HI>spar'd</HI> and recover'd the <HI>Fruits of the Earth.</HI> He hath sent mor∣tal <HI>Sickness</HI> in some places, and loudly call'd to us to be <HI>Ready,</HI> by Repeating <HI>Sud∣den Deaths</HI> in an extraordinary manner; and yet we now enjoy <HI>general Health.</HI> The God of Glory hath utter'd his Voice in <HI>Terrible Thunders,</HI> and threatn'd to Consume
<PB N="27" REF="002958_0029_0FE6A5FB6B85BD28"/>us by the <HI>Flame</HI> of his devouring Fire; And yet the <HI>Lives</HI> of his People have been <HI>Pre∣cious</HI> in his sight. He visited us with a <HI>violent Storm</HI> by which we sustain'd consi∣derable Damage; And yet much <HI>sparing Mercy</HI> was extended towards us, as to our Lives and Estates, by Sea and Land. And the day following, which was the <HI>Lord's-Day,</HI> God set his <HI>Bow</HI> in the Cloud, a <HI>Token</HI> of his Covenant, <HI>that he will not again destroy the Earth with a floud.</HI> Gen. 9.13, — 16. And if we consider the Day, and the fair oppor∣tunity we had of attending the Means of Grace after the Storm, we may in some sort behold our Glorious Saviour with a <HI>Rainbow</HI> about his head, as he appear'd to <HI>John</HI> in a Vision. <HI>Rev.</HI> 10.1. And thus, there appear'd a Rainbow round about the Throne, 4.3. "Whereby is fitly repre∣sented God's Covenant of Grace with his Church, that namely, notwithstanding all the storms and rempests of persecution and other troubles they must encounter with in this unsteady World, yet he will never suf∣fer them to Perish, as God spake once of the Waters of the Deluge, <HI>Gen.</HI> 9."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dutch Annotations.</NOTE>. God might in this bright Appearance give us a Token for Good, that in Judgment he will remember Mercy; and may we not
<PB N="28" REF="002958_0030_0FE6A63903A15240"/>humbly hope his Voice to us is that, Isa. 54.9. <HI>For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke thee.</HI> Wroth, "To wit, so as I have been, or so as to forsake thee utter∣ly"
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pook.</NOTE>. However, as we were not reform'd by these Things, God hath more lately Visited us with an <HI>Amazing shock of an Earthquake,</HI> which Providence appears still more wonderful, now that we hear there was a terrible shake of the Earth at <HI>Barba∣dos,</HI> near Two Thousand Miles distant from us, about Thirty Six Hours before. God then threatned to destroy us suddenly, and yet spared us in His great Mercy, tho' the Earth trembled, yet was it kept by the same Almighty Hand which shook it, from Opening and Swal∣lowing us up. We were <HI>perplexed, but not in despair; cast down, but not destroyed.</HI> Or, whatever dismal Apprehensions many might have of sudden Destruction, <HI>God's thoughts were not our thoughts</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. 55.8, 9.</NOTE>; but as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, so did he magni∣fy his Mercy in the Article of our extre∣mity; Indeed in this Judgment God hath spoken against us, and yet he earnestly re∣members
<PB N="29" REF="002958_0031_0FE6A606E07BFE88"/>us still, and gives a space for Re∣pentance, while some places are alarum'd by repeated Shakes and Noise. And is not this the Voice of God's Providence to us; <HI>If ye turn from the Evil, I will repent of the Evil</HI> — and that of our Lord and Judge, Luk. 13.3. <HI>Except ye repent, ye shall all likewise perish.</HI> Let us then be Exhorted earnestly and speedily to engage in this necessary Work, Seeking to God in the Name of Christ, to pour upon us his Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Repentance and Refor∣mation. And certainly, we should take Encouragement, when we hear, that God hath Sanctified these extraordinary means together with the dispensation of his Word, to make good impressions on many. I sup∣pose, few, if any can remember the time when People were so generally Awakened, and brought to say with trembling, <HI>What must we do to be saved</HI>

<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>Jer. 18.7, 8.</BIBL>
<P>At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it: If that nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>DOCT. I. <HI>GOD is won't to Threaten a People, and give them warning, before. He brings Destroying Judgments upon them.</HI></P>
<P>DOCT. II. <HI>IF such a People Repent of the Evil of their Sins, and turn from them to the Lord; God will also Repent, and not bring the Threatned Evil of Punishment upon them.</HI></P>
<P>UNDER this Second Doctrine we inquir'd, <HI>What is implied in a People's Repenting of the Evil of their Sins?</HI> An Answer hath already been given to this Inquiry. We therefore proceed to shew.</P>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="doctrine">
<PB N="34" REF="002958_0036_0FE6A63A79DB8600"/>
<P N="2">II. <HI>IF a People, when Threatned, thus Re∣pent, God will also Repent, and not bring the threatned Evil of Punishment upon them.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN God threatens a sinful People with Destruction, there's yet a Reserve of Mercy. The Threatning is not so absolute as to leave no place for Repentance, Jer. 36.2, 3. <HI>Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations from the day I spake unto thee, from the days of Josiah, even unto this day. It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do unto them; that they may return every man from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin.</HI>
<Q>The Omniscient God could not be at a loss about the Event; but this is spoken of the All knowing God after the man∣ner of Men, to shew how acceptable to Him true Repentance is.</Q></P>
<P>Now this Truth will appear, if we con∣sider, and duly weigh the following Parti∣culars,</P>
<P N="1">1. IT will appear, if we consider <HI>the gracious Promises and Declarations of God's Word.</HI> There are great and precious Pro∣mises made to the Penitent by the true God. Indeed God hath not absolutely pro∣mis'd particular Persons temporal Delive∣rance
<PB N="35" REF="002958_0037_0FE6A60890E103B0"/>from this or the other publick Cala∣mity, tho' they truly Repent. Job 9.22. <HI>He destroyeth the perfect, and the wicked.</HI> Eccl. 9.2. <HI>There is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked.</HI> However, God often sets a <HI>visible mark</HI> of His Favour upon such, when He is coming out against a Degenerate Peo∣ple in destroying Judgments, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 9.4. And if at any time He bring the temporal Evil upon them, He sanctifieth it, &amp; makes it work together for their good
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. 8.28.</NOTE>. God doth not punish such as an Enemy, in a way of vindictive Justice; but Chastiseth them as a merciful Father, for their profit. And no tribulation or <HI>distress shall be able to seperate them from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">ver. 35—39.</NOTE>. Nor may a Peni∣tent People expect to be delivered from all kinds of Calamity: While Sin remains, there will be Sorrow. But then, they shall not be plucked up and destroyed, the Evil here threatned. No! They shall continue a People before the Lord. He will dwell among them, be their God, and own them for his People. And the Affliction they suffer shall be sanctified to seperate them from their Sins; and not be sent in Wrath for their Destruction. Isai. 27.8, 9. <HI>He stayeth his rough wind in the day of the
<PB N="36" REF="002958_0038_0FE6A64452CF3368"/>east wind. By this therefore the iniquity of Jacob shall be purged, and this is the fruit to take away his sin.</HI> And thus God speaks very graciously concerning them that were carried Captive with <HI>Jeconiah,</HI> Jer. 24.5,—7. <HI>Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel, like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Cal∣deans for their good. For I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land, and I will build them, and not pull them down, and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord, and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return unto me with their whole heart.</HI> And as for the Church and People of God in the first and purest times of the Gospel, they were <HI>persecuted</HI> indeed, but not <HI>forsaken; cast down,</HI> but <HI>not destroy'd.</HI> 2 Cor. 4.9. The Spirit of God, and of Glory rested on them, and the trial of their Faith was more precious than Gold. The Church flourished like the <HI>Palm tree,</HI> un∣der her pressures, of which it is observ'd, "the more it is press'd down, the more it grows." What was said of God's <HI>Israel</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> may be applied to them. Exod. 1.12. <HI>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew.</HI> Thus it was in
<PB N="37" REF="002958_0039_0FE6A60FC8399358"/>a Spiritual sense. Vast numbers were born to God; the Blood of <HI>Martyrs</HI> being made by God the <HI>Seed</HI> of the Church
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>. Having hinted these things to state the point, and remove some seeming difficulties, I shall briefly mention some of the Promises which confirm and illustrate this Truth. Lev. 26.41, 2 — <HI>If then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity: Then will I remember my co∣venant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remem∣ber the land.</HI> Isai. 58.6,—8. <HI>Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that ye break eve∣ry yoke. Is it not to deal thy bread to the hun∣gry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast out, to thy house; when thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and that thou hide not thy self from thine own flesh? Then shall thy light break forth as the morning and thine health shall spring forth specility: and thy righteous∣ness shall go before thee, the glory of the Lord shall be thy re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d.</HI> Hes, 6.1. <HI>Come and let us return unto the Lord: for he hath torn, and he will heal us: he hath smitten, and he will bind us up. Ezek.</HI> 33.14, 15. Acts 2.38, 39. <HI>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remis∣sion
<PB N="38" REF="002958_0040_0FE6A64468EFDBC0"/>of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord your God shall call. Chap.</HI> 3.19. By such good words as these doth God encourage His People to Repent and turn to Him. Now we are assured that 'till Heaven and Earth pass, <HI>one jot or one title shall in no wise pass from the law till all be fulfilled.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THIS appears from <HI>the Provision made for true Penitents in Jesus Christ, and from the Constitution of the Covenant of Grace.</HI> God hath made abundant Provision for the Salvation of His People in Christ Jesus, who hath offer'd a Sacrifice of Atonement for the Congregation of His People, who look to Him by Faith, mourn for their Sins, and turn from them unto the Lord. Agreably, <HI>Aaron</HI> was commanded to offer a <HI>Sin-offer∣ing</HI> for the People, with the blood of which he was to <HI>make Atonement</HI> for all the Con∣gregation of <HI>Israel,</HI> Lev. 16.15—17. Thus on the <HI>Day</HI> of <HI>Atonement</HI> they were to afflict their Souls, and offer an Offering made by Fire unto the Lord, <HI>Lev.</HI> 23.27. Thus, tho Congregation of <HI>Israel</HI> were to <HI>kill</HI> the <HI>Passover, and sprinkle the Blood upon the door∣posts—that the destroyer might not come into their houses.</HI> Exod. 12. Which things did prefigure <HI>Jesus Christ the Lamb of God which
<PB N="39" REF="002958_0041_0FE6A5DB8A740298"/>taketh away the sin of the World</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joh. 1.19.</NOTE>. And we are hereby taught that such as do in a be∣lieving penitent manner look unto <HI>Jesus,</HI> shall find mercy with God. God will say of them, spare them from going down to the Pit, I have found a ransom. And tho' it be true, that none shall receive the ever∣lasting benefit of Christ's Sacrifice, but such us heartily receive the Lord Jesus, mouth∣ing for their sins with a godly Sorrow, yet the Body of a People fare the better on temporal accounts, and God will not destroy them, where such a frame of spirit is found prevailing among them. <HI>Zech.</HI> 12.6. — 10. And this is plain from the nature and tenor of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> the Cove∣nant of Grace, in which God gives encou∣ragement, not only to single Persons, but also to His People to Repent, that their Sins may be blotted out, and their Iniqui∣ties not be their ruin. Jer. 31.31, — 36. <HI>Behold, the days come saith the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: Not ac∣cording to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt (which my covenant they brake, although I was an hus∣band unto them, saith the Lord,) But this shall
<PB N="40" REF="002958_0042_0FE6A645A4DEEB48"/>be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they shall be my people. And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, know the Lord: for they shall all know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the Lord: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will re∣member their sin no more. Thus saith the Lord, which giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances if the moon and of the stars for a light by night, which divideth the sea when the waves thereof roar; the Lord of hosts is his name. If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.</HI> Compar'd with <HI>Hebr.</HI> 8.8, — 12. In which there seems to be a gracious promise of a <HI>national Conversion</HI> of the Jews, and then that they should not as a People, be rejected any more. And may not the People of God in <HI>New-England</HI> hope for a Dispensation of the Covenant of Grace relating to them, that shall resemble this? May we not hope that God will revive His Work among us, and not utterly cast us off?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>WHEN a People Repent, then God's Threatnings and Judgments have the desired
<PB N="41" REF="002958_0043_0FE6A60FDEC4DC90"/>Effect.</HI> These are means God useth to purge away the Sins of His People. When God threatens and brings lighter Judg∣ments, it is for their Warning, that they may be reclaimed and reformed. And therefore when these means are bless'd for this end, and the Work is in some good measure effected, God will return in a way of mercy and favour. He will repent, and change the course of His Providence to∣wards such a People. Now His Word <HI>ac∣complisheth that which he pleaseth, and pros∣pereth in the thing whereto he sent it</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. 55.21.</NOTE>. Now the <HI>Rod &amp; Reproof gives Wisdom;</HI> His Peo∣ple open their Ear to Discipline, and turn to Him that smiteth them. And therefore God will cast away the Rod, and shew Himself as a reconciled Father. Thus God said of His ancient People, Isai. 10.12. — <HI>When the Lord hath performed his whole work upon mount Zion, and on Jerusalem, I will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of Assyria.</HI> God calls the <HI>Assyrian</HI> the <HI>Rod</HI> of His <HI>Anger,</HI> ver. 5. And threatned to send him against an hypocritical Nation, <HI>ver.</HI> 6. But then, when the Work was done for which God sent him, then he would punish him, and deliver His People.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="42" REF="002958_0044_0FE6A645CD568D00"/>
4. THIS appears <HI>from God's Providential Dispensations towards His ancient Covenant People, and Others.</HI> Whatever their Sins had been, yet when they Repented, God also Repented of the Evil, and returned to them in a way of Favour. Thus, the <HI>House of Israel lamented after the Lord, put away Baalim, &amp;c.</HI> And God delivered them out of the Hand of the <HI>Philistines,</HI> 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 7. When <HI>Ephraim,</HI> i. e. "the Ten Tribes, or those of all the Tribes that fear'd the Lord", bemoan'd himself, and Repented, God said, <HI>Is Ephraim my dear Son? is be a pleasant Child? for since I spake against him, I do earnestly remember him still: — I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord,</HI> Jer. 31.18, — 20. Yea, when the <HI>Ninevites turned from their Evil way, God repented of the Evil that he said he would do unto them, and did it not,</HI> Jon. 3.10.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCT. III.</HI> BUT if a People when thus Threatned go on obstinately in their Sins, they may expect that God will bring His Destroying Judgments upon them till they are made desolate.</HEAD>
<P>CONTRARIES have contrary Consequen∣ces <HI>ver.</HI> 9, 10. Context. <HI>Israel</HI>'s forsaking the Lord, was to make their Land desolate, and a perpetual hissing, <HI>ver.</HI> 16. Deut. 28.13. <HI>If thou will not hearken unto the voice
<PB N="43" REF="002958_0045_0FE6A6121EC82468"/>of the Lord thy God, to observe to do all his commandments and his statutes which I com∣mand thee this day; then all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee.</HI> ver. 16, 36, 48, &amp;c. And the Sacred History informs us that these dreadful Threatnings were fulfilled upon them till they were cast out of the good Land God had given them; deprived of their especial Priviledges, and deliver'd up to an amazing Destruction. The Sinners of the <HI>Old World</HI> despis'd the Warnings God gave them by <HI>Noah,</HI> and re∣sisted His Spirit. Then <HI>the Flood came and destroyed them all,</HI> Gen. 7. Luk. 17.27. There's a destroying power in Sin persisted in, it hath ruin'd Nations and Kingdoms, <HI>Jer.</HI> 47. <HI>Amos 1st. &amp; 2d.</HI> Chapters. And this might be argued from God's Justice, Holiness, and His Truth in fulfilling the Threatning of His Word &amp;c. In this sense it may be said as, 1 Sam. 15.29. <HI>The strength of Israel will not lie, nor repent.</HI> God is bound for His own Glory as His highest End; and therefore if a People obstinately refuse to Repent and give Glory to God, they must expect that God will glorify Himself upon them in their Destruction, and so become fearful in Praises
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lev. 10.3. Exod. 15.11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="002958_0046_0FE648407611A4F0"/>
FURTHER to Confirm this awful Truth, I shall briefly observe God's manner of Pro∣ceeding in Judgment against an Impeninent People that enjoy the means of Grace, and are in Covenant with God.</P>
<P N="1">1. WHEN such a People go on Impeni∣tently and refuse to be Reformed by God's Word and Providence; <HI>He takes His griev∣ed Spirit from them.</HI> While God threatens His People, and sends lighter Judgments as Calls to Repentance, He also usually sends <HI>His Spirit</HI> to strive with them; but assureth us that His <HI>Spirit shall not always strive with man.</HI> Gen. 6.3. Accordingly when they resist and vex Him, quenching His good Motions, and sinning presumptuously against the Convictions He gives them; as His ancient People did
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Act. 7.51.</NOTE>. God is provok'd to withdraw His Spirit from the Means they enjoy; and to send His Plagues upon their Hearts; and then such as were blind are judicially blinded, such whose Hearts were hard, are hardned, being given up to their own Lusts, and the Temptations of Satan. Psal. 81.11, 12. <HI>My people would not hearken to my voice: and Israel would none of me. So I gave them up unto their own hearts lust: and they walked in their own counsels.</HI> And now God may threaten in
<PB N="45" REF="002958_0047_0FE6A6123A4BDBD0"/>His Word and by His Providence; but they will not turn at His Reproof. Isai. 1.5. <HI>Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will re∣volt more and more.</HI> Now that message may be bro't to them, Isai. 6, 9, 10. <HI>And he said, Go and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not: and see ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert and he healed.</HI> It follows, ver. 11. —<HI>Till the cities be wasted without in∣habitant, and the houses without man, and the land be utterly desolate.</HI> And when God withdraws even the common Influences and Restraints of His Spirit, a People grow worse and worse under the outward means, and ripen apace for Ruin. They are as <HI>Reprobate silver, because God bath rejected them,</HI> Jer. 6.30, All the means us'd to purge away their dross become ineffectual. And now there is oftentimes an evil Spirit of of slumber and carnal security prevailing, over such a People; so that they will <HI>not consider their latter end, till they come down wonderfully,</HI> Lam. 1.9. And wo will be unto them, when God takes His Holy Spirit from them. As far as this Judgment is inflicted, so far is their Day of Grace at an end. The things of their Peace are now.
<PB N="46" REF="002958_0048_0FE6A64CF4BF6330"/>hidden from their eyes, and they will walk on in the paths which lead to destruction, <HI>Jer.</HI> 5.3,—14.</P>
<P>2 <HI>GOD then proceeds to take away the out∣ward Ordinances and Means of Grace from them.</HI> These are the Visible Tokens of God's Presence with His People. Thus God set up His Tabernacle, and dwelt a∣mong His ancient People. But when they despised the Means of Grace, and abused them to harden themselves in Sin, as if they were deliver'd to do these and the other Abominations, and might Sin with impunity: I say, when it was thus. God re∣mov'd these visible Tokens of His Presence and Favour, Jer. 7.9, 10. <HI>Will ye steal, mur∣der and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not. And come and stand before me in this house which is called by my Name, and say, we are delivered to do all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abominations?</HI> ver. 14. <HI>Therefore will I do unto this house which is called by my Name, wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you, and to your fathers, as I have done to Shilob.</HI> The <HI>Ark</HI> was an especial Token of God's Presence; but when the Israelites refused to repent and turn to the Lord, God gave it up into the hands of their Enemies, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> 4. The <HI>Temple</HI> af∣terwards with the holy things in it, was
<PB N="47" REF="002958_0049_0FE6A65851582F80"/>the great <HI>Medium</HI> of their instituted Wor∣ship; But when they boasted of God's holy Mountain, crying, The Temple of the Lord, as if this would secure God's Pre∣sence, notwithstanding their Impenitency, God in His over-ruling Providence burnt and destroy'd it, first by the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> then by the <HI>Romans;</HI> and cast them out of His sight. And thus God threatned the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> Rev. 2.5. <HI>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen; and repent and do the first works, or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou repent.</HI> And what a fearful Example for the Con∣firmation of the truth before us, have we in this, and the other <HI>Asian Churches,</HI> once highly favour'd with the light and privi∣ledges of the Gospel?</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>WHEN God is thus departed, and His Covenant broken, Destroying Judgments enter in, and make a People desolate.</HI> Now the Glory and Defence of a People are gone; And there's a wide breach made at which desolating Judgments come pouring in as an overflowing Scourge. They who have been thus highly savour'd, but refuse to be the Lord's People, provoke Him to pluck them up, and destroy them from be∣ing a People in the Earth. Thus God threatned that <HI>Ephraim should be broken, that
<PB N="48" REF="002958_0050_0FE6A64E1BF2B578"/>it be not a people,</HI> Isai. 7.8. And apostate <HI>Israel</HI> is forbidden to rejoyce as other Peo∣ple; because they had gone a whoring from their God, <HI>Hos.</HI> 9.1. Others may for a time prosper in outward respects, tho' God be not their Covenant God; but when His People break His Covenant, and refuse to return unto Him, their Civil and Religious Priviledges, their Outward and Spiritual Enjoyments have been taken away together. When <HI>Israel</HI> forsook the Lord, and he had rejected them, their Civil and Ecclesiastical Constitution was broken, and they were scattered abroad to the four Winds of Heaven. How pathetically did our Saviour lament over them when He saw their Ruin approaching! Mat. 23 37, 8. <HI>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy chil∣dren together even as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not. Behold, your house is left unto you desolate.</HI></P>

<P>USE. I. FROM what hath been said we may infer, <HI>that there is Reason to fear some dreadful Judgments yet to come on the Christian World.</HI> If we look into <HI>Great Britain,</HI> what People have been more high∣ly
<PB N="49" REF="002958_0051_0FE6A6586AACE958"/>favour'd with the Light and Priviledges of the Glorious Gospel? Or experienced more remarkable Deliverances in times of imminent Danger? Who have had louder Calls to Repentance in God's threatned Judgments; or more faithful Warnings by His Ministers? And yet Iniquity abounds after all, yea Crying Sins. And do not many refuse to return and reform? How little is there to be seen of that Good Spi∣rit which animated the <HI>first Reformers</HI> in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland!</HI> Alas! By what we can learn, the power of Religion is very much weaken'd and decay'd among them, as well as among ourselves. And may we not fear God will Visit them with terrible Judgments? Surely we may well say with the Psalmist, Psal. 119.120. <HI>My flesh trembleth for fear of thee, and I am a∣fraid of thy judgments.</HI> I speak not these things to discourage any that tremble at God's Word; but that we may all be quickned to Watch and Pray, and keep our Garments. Things may seem to look fair; and we ought to bless God for the Tranqui∣lity enjoyed: but what settled Peace can be expected while so many Dishonour God, Despise Christ, and reject the Offers of the Gospel? While <HI>Rome</HI> hath such Power, and they that call themselves Reform'd shew so little regard to Religion in the
<PB N="50" REF="002958_0052_0FE6A64E3383F918"/>Power and Purity of it? The Lord grant that we may not say, Peace and Safety, when sudden Destruction cometh
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thes. 5.3.</NOTE>. The Lord help us, being mov'd with fear, to get into the <HI>Ark,</HI> into Christ, that what∣ever Evils come, we may be safe.</P>
<P N="2">2. LEARN what is <HI>our great Duty and Interest this Day.</HI> To hear God's Voice, Re∣pent and turn unto Him. God hath spoken in the Threatnings of His Word, and by the Rebukes of His Providence. Let us then to Day hear His Voice, and not harden our Hearts. The Lord hath rored out of Zion with a Voice which may well make us to tremble; and yet spare us from the threatned Destruction: And now says to us, <HI>if ye return, I will Repent of the Evil</HI>—. But threatens to bring Ruin upon us, if we go on impenitently, and refuse to be Re∣formed. Now then that God sets before us Life and Death, Blessing and Cursing, let us choose Life that we may live. <HI>O that there were such an Heart in us, that we would fear the Lord, and keep all his Commandments always, that it might be well with us, and our Children forever</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Deut. 5.29.</NOTE>! O that we could as a People so consider of our Evil ways as to determine to forsake them! that we could Mourn because we have offended and disho∣noured
<PB N="51" REF="002958_0053_0FE6A661CBBFE388"/>God by our Sins, and so turn to the Lord in hearty Repentance; that we could then heartily and successfully engage in the Work of Reformation. Our Days of Fasting and Prayer will rise up in Judg∣ment against us, unless we bring forth fruits meet for Repentance: Let us therefore take heed and beware of giving God reason to Complain of us as of Ephraim and Judah, Hos. 6.4. — <HI>Your goodness is as a morning-cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away:</HI> Lest that threatning be fulfill'd up∣on us, Chap. 13.3. <HI>Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with a whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the chimney.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>LET each of us be Exhorted to Repent and turn from all our Transgressions; so Ini∣quity shall not be our Ruin.</HI> This Word which is spoken of a Nation, a People, con∣cerns every one of us personally. We are all Transgressors of God's Law; were shapen in Iniquity, and have been guilty of innu∣merable actual Sins. And God in His Word speaks against the Sinner, and says, <HI>The Soul that sinneth it shall die,</HI> Ezek. 18.4. Yea, assureth us that the <HI>Wicked shall go away into everlasting punishment,</HI> Mat. 23.46. And that our Lord Jesus should be <HI>reveal'd from heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not
<PB N="52" REF="002958_0054_0FE6A654EC62DE88"/>God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> 2 Thes. 1.7, 8. Now the Doctrine of Repentance is a great Gospel Command. Our Lord Himself, the great Prophet of His Church, began His publick Ministry with Preaching this Doctrine, Mat. 4.17. <HI>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</HI> The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> preach'd this Doctrine to the Jews, <HI>Act.</HI> 2.38. And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> informs us that he resti∣fyed to the Jews and Greeks <HI>Repentance towards God,</HI> Act. 20.21. He declar'd that this was their duty, and urg'd it not only upon the <HI>Jews,</HI> but also upon the <HI>Greeks;</HI> i. e. the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> This Command is pub∣lish'd to all that live within the Sound of the Gospel, Act. 17.30. <HI>God now command∣eth all men every where to Repent.</HI> And the Gospel gives us encouragement to attend this Duty, how many and great soever our Sins have been, assuring us that Jesus Christ is come to call, not the Righteous but Sin∣ners to Repentance; that He hath pur∣chased Pardon for all penitent Believers, and is exalted to be a Prince, and a Saviour, <HI>to give Repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of Sins</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Act. 5.31.</NOTE>. The Word of God also assureth us, that <HI>whoso confesseth &amp; for saketh his sins,
<PB N="53" REF="002958_0055_0FE6A661E1AB85A8"/>shall have mercy,</HI> Prov. 28.13. And that the chief of Sinners have found Mercy, when they have thus besought the Lord, and turned to him, 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 23.12, 13.1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.13,—16. Let us then be encouraged to ask of God His Holy Spirit to work this and all other Graces in us; Let each of us smite on our own Breasts and say, What have I done? Let us offer to God that humble Request, Lord, be merciful to me a Sinner. Let us be sensible of the Plague of our own Hearts, and bitterly bewail the dishonour we have done to God, and the wrong we have done our own Souls by our Sins: Let us abhor our selves upon the account of our Sins, and turn from them in inward hatred and aversion. For, a <HI>broken and a contrite heart God will not despise</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. 51.17.</NOTE>. Let us return to the Lord as to our God, with holy Resolutions to cleave to Him, and walk in His Commandments. Let us <HI>look unto Jesus,</HI> and by Faith rely upon Him to heal and cleanse our Souls, whose Blood purgeth the Conscience from dead Works, and cleanseth from all Sin, <HI>Hebr.</HI> 9.14.1 <HI>Job.</HI> 1.7. Thus we shall be of those blessed ones whose transgressions are for∣given, whose Sins are covered, and to whom the Lord imputeth not Iniquity.
<PB N="54" REF="002958_0056_0FE6A65507D6C660"/>Psal. 32.5. <HI>I acknowledged my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not hid: and said I will confess my transgressions unto the Lord, and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THE last USE may be <HI>of Consolation to the Penitent.</HI> Be you Comforted: God will repent of the Evil, and not bring it upon you: His anger is turned away, and He will Comfort you. <HI>For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity, whose Name is Holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit, to revive the spirit of the bum∣ble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls which I have made,</HI> Isai. 57.15, 16. There's Joy in Heaven over such, and God will give them the joy of His Salvation. Sometimes God sets a mark upon 'em, when He is coming out a∣gainst a sinful People in destroying Judg∣ments, and spareth them in His great Mercy, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 9. And if they are at any time cast into the Furnace, the Son of God will be present with them, so that they shall not be consum'd, but come forth as Gold out of the Fire. You that truly Re∣pent, do also trust in the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> and you shall find Rest to your Souls in Him, whom God hath sent <HI>to heal the bro∣ken
<PB N="55" REF="002958_0057_0FE6A663F12CE1E8"/>hearted,</HI> Luk. 4.18. He hath purchased the Consolations of the Spirit for such as you, and knows how to speak a Word in Season to your weary Souls. And He will speak Peace to His People: But O take heed then, and do not turn again to folly! To Conclude; <HI>Blessed are they who</HI> thus <HI>mourn; for they shall be Comforted:</HI> God will give to these Mourners in Zion the Oyl of Joy for Mourning, the Garment of Praise for the spirit of Heaviness, <HI>Isai.</HI> 61.3. And in due time He will <HI>present them faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy.</HI></P>
