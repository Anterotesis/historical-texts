<P>SEVERAL of the Editors in their introductions to the following Testimonies, have informed us that the consent of the Preacher to their publication, tho' solicited, had not been obtained, which is assigned as a reason for not inserting his name;—it may now be unnecessary to with-hold it, as by his removal from this state of probation, beyond the reach of human cen∣sure or human applause, the Reader may be gratified therewith, without giving just occasion of offence to any. Several attempts to describe this worthy Servant of CHRIST appeared in the public prints soon after his decease—two of those characters are part of the present collection, which with the account given of his religious progress and faithful labours in the Gospel of JESUS, by his Brethren in religious profession, extracted from Piety promoted, the eighth part, may be a sufficient information to those readers who were unacquainted with him and, the high estimation in which he was held by those who knew him best.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER OF THE LATE MR. <HI>SAMUEL FOTHERGILL,</HI> BROTHER TO THE PHYSICIAN DR. FOTHERGILL,</HEAD>
<P>TO commemorate the virtues of great and eminent men, who have been honourable in their day, is a tribute due to their memory. A tribute which sensible men pay from emotions of respectful gratitude; and from a hope that it may prove an incentive to the Living to emulate their virtues.</P>
<P>Of this class the late Mr. SAMUEL FOTHERGILL, of Warrington, an eminent Preacher among the Qua∣kers, may with great justice be ranked. I knew him well, and had the happiness of his occasional acquaint∣ance; I call it the happiness, because I never enjoyed the company of any person from whom I received more real satisfaction; and however diversified with affliction, the future part of my life may prove, I shall never re∣member those hours I have spent with him, but with pe∣culiar pleasure. He was an happy compound of the
<PB N="4" REF="016777_0004_0F9E2EDD28DC01B8"/>gentleman and the christian; the virtues and amiable qualities of each character being admirably blended in him. Graceful in his person and deportment, easy and affable in his manner, he commanded both respect and love; he possessed natural abilities far superior to the generality of mankind; and improved them to the ut∣most of his power. Well read both in books and men, his studies did not terminate in barren speculation; but the great truths of religion were deeply implanted in his heart, and beamed forth illustriously in a benevolent and truly christian conduct.</P>
<P>As a member of civil society he was exceedingly useful, filling up the social and relative duties of life with great propriety. Blameless in his manners, kind, charitable, and ready on all occasions to devote his time and talents to promote the best of all causes, the good of mankind. He lived beloved, and his loss is deeply deplored by all who had the happiness of know∣ing his worth.</P>
<P>As a Preacher, he was far superior to most who fill that station: Sound in the important doctrines of the christian faith, he endeavoured to promote them uni∣versally, with the greatest energy of language, and the most persuasive eloquence. In this capacity he was indeed truly great; and his greatness received additi∣onal lustre from his humility. Although followed by numbers, and courted by persons of superior rank and station, and admired by those of all persuasions, the applause which his eminence justly acquired, did not exalt, but evidently tended to make him humble. He was a person of an enlarged mind, zealous without bigotry, and a steady promoter of universal charity. In his sermons, it was evident to all his intelligent hearers, that he deeply felt the force of those solemn truths he delivered; and his manner of displaying them was so justly emphatical, that none but the insensible
<PB N="5" REF="016777_0005_0F9E2EDEF3472E98"/>or obdurate could withstand their force, or remain un∣affected by them. He travelled much from the most disinterested motives, among his friends in Great-Bri∣tain, Ireland, and the American Colonies, for the pro∣motion of piety and christian virtue, and for the ad∣vancement of that faith and religion in which he most surely believed, and was so eminent an example.</P>
<P>During the latter part of his life he was much in∣disposed in his health; but (as I have heard from the best authority) perfectly happy and easy in his mind, having an evidence in himself that he was approach∣ing that state of felicity which is prepared for the righteous. This evidence supported him through the remains of a painful life, and was his unfailing hope in the awful hour of death, which (when near his end) he declared, <Q>Had no terrors, nor would the grave have any victory.</Q> And also added, <Q>That as he had lived, so he should close with the most unshaken assurance, that he had not followed cunningly devised fables, but the pure living and eternal substance.</Q> Such was his exemplary life—Such his triumphant death!</P>
<P>A life so spent is truly honourable—And such a death unspeakably glorious.</P>

<P>ON the 15th instant paid the last debt of nature, Mr. SAMUEL POTHERGILL, of Warrington, an eminent Preacher amongst the people called Quakers, endowed with qualifications superior to most, and ani∣mated by a zeal truly apostolic, he long preached the interesting truths of the gospel to mankind; whilst the uniform tenor of his life, devoted to religion and spent in the practice of every virtue, was the strongest com∣ment on his doctrine.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 TYPE="biography">
<P>SAMUEL FOTHERGILL, of Warrington in Lancashire, was the sixth son of our worthy an∣cient friend JOHN FOTHERGILL, mentioned in this Treatise; see page 29, and of MARGARET his wife, for an account of whom see volume the sixth, page 90, of Piety promoted.</P>
<P>This their son being of an active and lively disposi∣tion, and during his apprenticeship mostly from under the watchful eye of his affectionate parent, he fled from the Holy Cross of CHRIST, and indulged himself in the gratifications of folly and licentiousness; violating the repeated convictions of divine grace in his own mind, which had been mercifully extended from his early years, thereby wounding the soul of his tender father (of whose religious care to form and lead the tender minds of his children to piety and virtue, we have an account in the memoirs of his life;) yet his pious admonitions proved nevertheless, as bread cast on the waters, which returned after many days; for about the twenty first year of his age, the visitation of divine love was so powerfully renewed, that it proved effectual to turn his steps out of the paths of vanity; and as he has expressed, with humble and awful gratitude to the Preserver of men, <HI>It then appeared clear to his under∣standing,
<PB N="7" REF="016777_0007_0F9E2EDFE416FBB0"/>that would be the last call the heavenly Father would favour him with;</HI> he therefore consulted no long∣er with flesh and blood, but gave up to the holy visi∣tation, devoting his whole heart and affections to such reconciliation with GOD, through the mediation of JESUS CHRIST; and abiding in great humility under the purifying operation of the holy Ghost and fire, he became thereby qualified for those eminent services he was called into; for in a few months, by the con∣straning power and love of GOD, his mouth was open∣ed to bear a Testimony to the sufficiency of that holy Arm that had plucked him as a brand out of the fire: Thus a dispensation of the ministry being committed to his charge, he attended faithfully thereto, and moved therein at the requirings, and under the direction of divine wisdom, by which means he soon became an able minister of the gospel, called thereto and qualified by the Holy Ghost, under which influence he laboured with diligence and devoted much of his time and strength, when health permitted, to the service of his dear LORD and Master; for the continuance of whose favours he counted nothing too near or dear to part with, that he might be instrumental in gathering souls to GOD, which was the object he had in view in all his gospel labours; being diligent himself, he endeavour∣ed much to excite friends to a due and constant at∣tendance of meetings for religious worship, and those for the disciplince of the church.</P>
<P>Thro' the course of his gospel labours, both in pub∣lic and private, animated by divine love, he expressed an uncommon warmth of affection for the rising youth of this generation, with whom he was frequently led into a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> brotherly feeling and sympathy for their present and eternal welfare; under which concern his love to this class of both sexes, under all denominati∣ons, was strong and ardent.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="016777_0008_0F9E2EE09911B980"/>
He travelled much in this Nation and Scotland, se∣veral times in Ireland, and once through most of the North American Colonies, in the service of truth; where, tho' singularly humbled in a sense of poverty, weakness and insufficiency on his first landing, he was by accounts received, marvelously strengthened, both in public and private, in gospel authority and love, to the awakening and comforting of many.</P>
<P>In the fore part of the year 1769, he visited most of the families of friends in the monthly-meeting of Grace church street, London; in which service he was divine∣ly strengthened and enabled to extend a helping hand to many in close and necessary labour, for their in∣creasing care, to live and act consistent with our holy profession, to the comfort and help of divers, and his own peace; and afterwards, at two different opportu∣nities, he visited the families of friends in Horslydown and Westminster monthly-meetings in that city, to the same good effect.</P>
<P>He mostly attended the yearly-meetings in London, and other places, when of bodily ability; in which his gospel labours were very acceptable and edifying; being particularly careful when called from home, to return to his family and friends with as much expedition as the nature of his service would admit.</P>
<P>Having acquired a moderate competency by his dili∣gence and industry, he declined trade for several years before his decease, devoting his time and talents to the service of the churches. As a Pillar in the Lord's house he was stedfast, being actuated by a christian and manly zeal; in deportment grave; his private con∣versation was savory and edifying, corresponding with his ministry, which at times went forth as a flame, piercing the obdurate, yet discended like dew upon the tender plants of our heavenly Father's planting, the
<PB N="9" REF="016777_0009_0F9E2EE154BE39F8"/>true mourners in zion, with these he travelled in a deep sympathy of spirit; in his gospel labours free from affectation, in doctrine clear, sound and pathetic, filled with charity, allowing for the prejudices of mankind, being indeed a minister and elder worthy of double honour, speaking whereof he knew, and what his own hands had handled of the good word of life.</P>
<P>He endured a long and painful illness with much patience and resignation, and towards the close of his time expressed himself to some of his relations, when they took leave of him, previous to their setting out for the yearly-meeting in London, to the following effect: <HI>Our health is no more at our command, than length of days:—Mine seems drawing fast towards a conclusion; but I am content with every allotment of Providence, for they are all in wisdom,—unerring wisdom.</HI></P>
<P><HI>There is one thing which as an arm underneath, bears up and supports; and tho' the rolling tempestuous billows surround, yet my head is kept above them, and my feet are firmly established.—O! seek it,—press after it,—lay fast hold of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Tho' painful my nights, and wearisome my days, yet I am preserved in patience and resignation.—Death has no terrors, nor will the grave have any victory.—My soul triumphs over death, hell and the grave.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Husbands and wives, parents and children, health and riches, must all go—disappointment is another name for them.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I should have been thankful had I been able to have got to the ensuing yearly-meeting in London, which you are now going to attend, where I have been so often re∣freshed
<PB N="10" REF="016777_0010_0F9E2EE267985658"/>with my brethren; but it is otherwise allotted:—I shall remember them, and some of them will remember me.—The Lord knows best what is best for us; I am content and resigned to his will.</HI></P>
<P><HI>I feel a foretaste of that joy that is to come;—and who would wish to change such a state of mind?</HI></P>
<P><HI>I should be glad if an easy channel could be found to inform the yearly-meeting that as I have lived, so I shall close, with the most unshaken assurance, that we have not followed cunningly devised fables, but the pure living eter∣nal substance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Let the aged be strong, let the middle aged be animat∣ed, and the youth encouraged; for the Lord is still with Zion; the Lord will bless Zion.</HI></P>
<P><HI>If I be now removed out of his church militant, where I have endeavoured in some measure to fill up my duty, I have an evidence that I shall gain an admittance into his glorious church triumphant, far above the heavens.</HI></P>
<P><HI>My dear love is to all them that love the Lord Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>He departed this life at his house in Warrington the 15th, and was buried the 19th day of the sixth month 1772, at Penheth, in the fifty-seventh year of his age, and the thirty-sixth of his ministry.</P>

<HEAD><HI>Extract from the Publisher's Introduction to the Printer of the public Ledger, dated London, September</HI> 4, 1769.</HEAD>
<P>"On a visit lately to a literary acquaintance in the country, I met with the enclosed manuscript copy of an Epistle to the inhabitants of Tortola in America, addressed to a society under the distinguished appella∣tion of Friends. I was induced to borrow it to take a copy for my own use, and several of my acquaintance expressing a desire of having it printed, that they might become possessed of some copies without the trouble of writing them, I have sent it for insertion in order to oblige them. It is but justice to acknowledge that neither the author, nor his relations know any thing of its being conveyed to the press for public inspecti∣on. Convinced that it may have a tendency to profit society in general, and cannot possibly be productive of disadvantageous consequences to any individual, I did not chuse to risk its suppression, by asking leave for its publication.</P>
<P>Whatever blame is due to its appearance, is, there∣fore, entirely my own; whatever merit may be found in the performance, is due to its author, as the instru∣ment of the instruction conveyed thereby; which is all the preface and apology that seems necessary, by way of introduction, from</P>

<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO FRIENDS IN THE ISLAND OF <HI>TORTOLA.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THOUGH I am personally a stranger, and un∣known to most of you; yet ye have been, of late time especially, so frequently the subject of close thoughtfulness to me, and with so much warmth as to engage my mind to visit you in a collective capacity with this Epistle, from some apprehensions of duty, and with an heart replenished with sincere good will, in which I wish you the possession of that happiness which is everlasting.</P>
<P>It was tidings of great joy to the living body of friends in this land, to hear that the Lord Almighty was at work in your Island to beget children to himself: and that the same substantial virtue which wrought upon many in this and other nations, to redeem and purify them a people to the praise of his great name, had also visited you with the day-spring from on high; and pro∣duced the same blessed fruits in measure, even a death
<PB N="13" REF="016777_0013_0F9E2EE91ECA89B0"/>unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness; and, by the baptism of the Holy Ghost, brought them into the body whereof Christ is head.</P>
<P>Oh the tenderness, the fear, and watchfulness, which attended some of your souls in that day! A precious day of visitation, which ought for ever to be remembered; a day wherein the Lord allured some of you, and brought you into the wilderness; speaking comfortably to you, and in his own time, gave you vineyards from thence. Some of you, I believe, have in remembrance those times of divine betrothing, and cannot but ac∣knowledge it was the Lord's doing. Then the mind was humbled as in the dust, and a living concern arose to walk in white, and to enter into covenant with the Lord your God. A covenant you then hoped would never be broken; in this simplicity of heart, the Lord's children are ever safest; almighty power watching over them for good, and regarding them with a father's care.</P>
<P>As individuals amongst you were thus engaged, the spiritual sympathy and fellowship of the one body spread over sea and land; and we became as epistles written in one another's hearts; and were baptized by the one spirit into the one body, wherein is the bond of peace, and unity of the faints; in this stood our rejoicing on your account; for it is not the accession of numbers to any name or distinction amongst men, but the gather∣ing of souls to the everlasting shepherd, which gives joy to the Lord's family in heaven and earth.</P>
<P>Now, dear Friends, is not the dew of your morning at times brought to recollection, and its heavenly relish remembered, yet hath not a loss sensibly attended you, and the once promising plantation amongst you become less fruitful and beautiful? If so, where shall we enquire for the cause? We shall not find any deficiency in divine compassion; but the loss hath been occasioned by a ne∣glect
<PB N="14" REF="016777_0014_0F9E2EE993BE5DF8"/>to follow on to know the Lord in his own way and leadings; and a departure in heart from him hath ensued, whereby the work hath been marred; and that goodness, wherein the holy unchangeable one would have establish∣ed you, and rendered a permanent blessing and beauty to you, hath been to too many as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it hath soon passed away.</P>
<P>Such ever was the consequence of unfaithfulness to the discoveries of the pure light; weakness, revolt, and back-sliding have ensued, and when people have forsaken the fountain of living waters (which is open for sanctifica∣tion and refreshment) all their labour and inventions have been as broken cisterns that can hold no water, and the latter end of such, unless they return and repent, will be worse than their former un-enlightened state.</P>
<P>Bear with me, dear friends, in this freedom: My soul longs for your help and restoration; that by and through you the great name may be exalted in those Islands, and <HI>that</HI> part of the Lord's footstool may be∣come glorious.</P>
<P>Let, I beseech you, the seeming foremost rank amongst you, look closely to their own steps; and consider care∣fully, whether they have not by some means contributed to the general decay of lively zeal and care, through their own declension and lukewarmness, for it is most certain the faithfulness, or unfaithfulness of this rank hath a very great influence over young and tender minds, as well as of those who may be more advanced in years, than experience, and yet not void of a secret relish for heavenly matters. Return, therefore, I beseech you, O ye Chiefs amongst the people, to your first love, and do your first works lest greater desolation ensue; and he, who walketh in the midst of the seven golden candle∣sticks, come unto you quickly, and remove your's out of its place; for why should the candlestick remain, when the light and lustre of the candle is extinguished.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="016777_0015_0F9E2EEA4D5B8288"/>
And dearly beloved friends of the rising generation, and ye in the prime of your life, suffer and receive the word of exhortation from one who tenderly loves you; remember your Creator and your Judge. Let not the foolish amusements, or vain conversation of this world, prevail to turn you aside from your great and everlasting interest; remember there is not any thing of this world can lay the foundation of eternal peace. It is an earnest humble seeking after the sanctifying hand, and submissi∣on to its virtue which can alone fashion you as vessels of honour, and fit you for the heavenly kingdom. Cherish the secret drawings of divine love, be not ashamed of its tendering restraining effects. Why should you sell your souls for a thing of nought, for such will be the smiles and frowns of this world, in a day that is hastily approaching. Let not, therefore, the evil example of others, nor the reproach of the scornful prevail to your hurt; but retain the fear of God, which will keep the heart clean; and be an excellent enduring treasure, when every thing else shall vanish as a vapour.</P>
<P>And it most certainly behoves you, friends, who are natives of this land, and have had your education amongst us as a people, and been frequently directed to the heavenly monitor, to walk with great circumspecti∣on: Ye are amongst a people who have been made par∣takers of the like precious faith with us, principally through the immediate reach of the divine hand. Will not their eyes be turned to look at your conduct, and to observe the fruits of your faith, by its prevalence in your lives and conversations: And if instead of the blessed fruits of righteousness, the contrary should appear, and your conduct be the means of stumbling to any, and evil liberties be pursued by you to your own and others hurt; to such I testify in the name, and under an awful sense of the authority of the Most High, it had been better for them never to have known the way of righ∣teousness. Heavy, very heavy will be the weight of
<PB N="16" REF="016777_0016_0F9E2EEB5C03CC78"/>complicated guilt of their own transgressions, and the transgressions of others made worse by their example. Wo from a righteous and dreadful God, to those by whom such offences come.</P>
<P>I make no doubt but there are amongst you an honest seed; an afflicted and poor people, some of the Lord's poor, who retain in some good degree, their first love, and bewail the hurt of Zion. I beseech such to stand fast in their own lots, abide in the faith and patience; be sober and hope to the end. Though the times are gloomy, the out-goings of the morning are of God, and he can, and will in his own time, cause the wilderness to become a fruitful field. Look not too much at the declension of others, lest your faith should fail, but stedfastly look to, and follow on to know the Lord Al∣mighty, who remains for ever, and the defection of multitudes can by no means impair his unchangeable truth and righteousness.</P>
<P>In a sense of the fresh extendings of ancient all suffi∣cient help, I most tenderly and affectionately salute you; may the scattered amongst you be brought home, and the negligent be roused to diligence, whilst yet a little day continues. Let the tender breathings still remaining be cherished, that they may gather strength, and enter with holy prevalence the ear of the Lord and Father of his people. This is the sincere prayer of one concerned at heart, for your restoration and stability in righteous∣ness and peace forever.</P>

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE following pathetic, and moving exhor∣tations, were, as carefully as possible, taken down in characters, as they flowed from the lips of the preacher to large and crowded audiences; at which were present numbers of different per∣suasions: many of whom have requested copies of the transcript; and others have desired, in the strongest terms, that they might be made still more public, by means of the press.</P>
<P>The writer is desirous of obliging many, with∣out offence to any individual—The manuscript hath been read and approved of, by numbers of superior judgment, who were present; and who have joined in this opinion, that from their being published, good may proceed to the well disposed; nor can any kind of harm be foreseen to accrue from hence.</P>
<P>The writer is not conscious of having mistaken the author's sense: And if to the memory of any who were then present, there should occur any va∣riations from his immediate expressions, the editor is assured there can be but few, and those not of moment, he having to the readiest expedition, joined the most perfect attention, tho' in a crowd∣ed congregation (where he could have no other rest, or support, than the hand or the knee.)</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="016777_0019_0F9E2EEFAE68CC60"/>
Indeed! the lively force and heart-felt energy with which the subsequent exhortations were de∣livered, must remain from that time wanting: nor is it material to offer, that it is not in the power of the most faithful transcriber, to convey that enforcing part to his readers. The texts, i. e. chapter and verse, have been since added, in or∣der to illustrate the work, and render it (if possi∣ble!) more pleasing.</P>
<P>The editor hath likewise taken down (by desire) two other Sermons, from the same preacher; the subject of the first taken from the prayer of Agur, <HI>Prov.</HI> xxx. 7, 8, and 9. the other from <HI>Cant.</HI> iv. and 12, and at the close of each, a Prayer; but those will continue in manuscript unless a public edition of them be encouraged.</P>
<P>As the minister hath been repeatedly solicited, but in vain, to consent to the present publication; the reader must not wonder that his name is not published.</P>

<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Sam. xx. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Art thou in health; my brother?</HI></P>
<P>IT hath been in my mind to adopt the language of salutation of Joab to Amasa; but with sentiments different, far different, from those which actuated the treachery of Joab; even those of true and tender affection, and with a mind replenished with that cha∣rity, which wisheth well to all.</P>
<P><HI>Art thou in health; my Brother?</HI></P>
<P>I could wish, with all possible solicitude, to lead every mind present, into the most careful enquiry, in respect to their spiritual state of health; and to their immediate relation, and affinity, to that supreme almighty being, who is the just and awful judge of quick and dead. I fear it hath proceeded from too anxious a solicitude for the health of your bodies, and prosperity of your tem∣poral concerns, that too many of you have too frequent∣ly, and in a manner totally, neglected the great concern of your immortal souls; which is indeed <HI>the one thing needful.</HI></P>
<P>Those temporal concerns, I say, which are of a trifling perishing nature, have, I fear! interrupted and taken off from this principal concern: your anxiety and applicati∣on towards the attainment of the treasures and the enjoy∣ment of the pleasures of the world, have occasioned too great a neglect of your religious duty.</P>

The conveniences of life are, by no means, a con∣temptible concern, where they are bounded with tem∣perance, and confined within their proper channel: but as there is a part in us of infinitely greater, of no less than eternal moment; it also requires an attention pro∣portionable to its proper worth; for what are temporal concerns, when compared with the important one of eternity!</P>
<P>The state of the body is subject to divers maladies; and when we have done our utmost to preserve it, we shall find in the end (and how soon that may be none knows) that it is of necessity, subject to the stroke of death, and to the inclosure of the grave.</P>
<P>I have therefore thought it by no means an improper enquiry for each individual to make, and deeply ponder, What is thy state, or how is it with thee, O my soul! who art capable of partaking of immortal joys, and destined to triumph over death and the grave? <HI>When this earthly tabernacle shall be dissolved,</HI> thy appointment and destination, if in proper soundness for it, shall be made persect with the whole family of GOD, and be no longer subject to the diseases, pains, trials and afflic∣tions of this life, but share the things which are of GOD,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 23.</NOTE> <HI>With the general assembly and church of the first-born, whose names are written in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>As this is of the most infinite importance to the sons of men, I have thought it my particular duty, upon the present occasion, to put you in mind of the necessary enquiry into the state of your spiritual health; the con∣dition of your immortal souls: being very apprehen∣sive that all of you, my brethren, are not in perfect health, who have outwardly the appearance of health; but that, on the contrary, many are in a dangerous
<PB N="23" REF="016777_0022_0F9E2EF1D6B9FE40"/>state of disease and stupefaction; have only preserved a lethargic frame, and are tottering upon the brink of destruction.</P>
<P>This enquiry into the present state of experience, and of advancement in the work of salvation, hath branch∣ed itself out in my view, and divided into several classes, those who are now within the audience of my voice. And, in the first place, I intreat the attention of you, the elders, amongst whom our LORD, as amongst so many shepherds, hath divided his flock; over whom you are appointed to watch, and to teach them to persevere in the path which leadeth to eternal life!</P>
<P>You have experienced the power of religion: you have<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>put on the armour of light;</HI> and ought to stand as guardian angels, and to call as the angel called, say∣ing,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Come up hither, and I will shew thee the bride, the lamb's wife.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Are you in health,</HI> my brethren? <HI>Are you in health,</HI> my sisters?—<HI>Are you in health,</HI> my fellow labourers in the LORD?—Are you in a lively active state in the cause of religion? in the cause of virtue and tempe∣rance? in the power of the gospel, as it is in CHRIST?</P>
<P>If those that have been called with an high and holy calling, as delegated shepherds under the one great shep∣herd, walk uprightly in his fear and to his glory; then the sheep will with them be more likely to be gained upon to follow the great shepherd; they will then have a frequent desire, a longing appetite after the divine Manna, which cometh down from GOD out of Hea∣ven: for every life hath its food and its proper nutri∣ment, and a soul panting after Heaven can be satisfied with nothing short of the <HI>food</HI> from Heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="016777_0023_0F9E2EF28E3B5B38"/>
In the next place, I address <HI>you,</HI> my brethren in the work of the ministry, reminding you of its divine in∣stitution, all that have entered rightly into it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. v. 4.</NOTE> <HI>being called of God, as was Aaron.</HI></P>
<P>It is written,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm civ. 4</NOTE> <HI>he maketh his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire;</HI> and tho' the term <HI>angels</HI> be generally understood of the glorified spirits in Heaven; yet, as it signifies <HI>messengers,</HI> it here seems to be ap∣plicable to those whom the Most High prepares and sends forth, to excite and enliven his militant church on earth.—<HI>Are you in health, my brethren:</HI>—It is the divine will that you be fed with celestial food; not with the unlawful things of the world, nor with the un∣lawful love of its lawful things; but that you become <HI>as angels,</HI> and <HI>like his ministering spirits,</HI> as a flame of fire. He will make you, if with due constancy ye adhere to, and attend on him, a sacred and fixed flame of love, and of light never to be extinguished: your care, and pains, and labour here will be but a moment, your reward will be <HI>a crown of life everlasting.</HI> The bread that you eat, and the water that you drink, and of which ye minister their due share to others, will be daily springing up in you unto everlasting life! The di∣vine Manna and the daily sacrifice will be continued. Rest in hope,—look for the coming of your LORD.—Labour in the discharge of your duty.</P>
<P>Indeed it hath sometimes happened that some of the ministers of CHRIST,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. 1, 2.</NOTE> <HI>stewards of the mystery of God,</HI> have not been found faithful to what he required. Be ever mindful of the necessity of putting on and wearing the spiritual robes, prefigured by those of <HI>Aaron:</HI> the holy girdle about the loins; the breast-plate, with the <HI>Urim</HI> and <HI>Thummin;</HI> the <HI>Bell</HI> and the <HI>Pomegra∣nate.</HI> Some indeed have had the <HI>Bell</HI> sending forth an empty unavailing sound, but have wanted the <HI>Pome∣granate,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="016777_0024_0F9E2EF34DE77A90"/>the soul-enlivening fruit of the good spirit of CHRIST, our everlasting high priest.</P>
<P><HI>But I hope better things of you,</HI> beloved in CHRIST, <HI>and things that accompany salvation.</HI> I am sure we have need, with the utmost diligence, application, and care, to keep the loins of our minds girded about: we had need to stand upon the watch: we have great need to maintain the utmost steadiness: for if we, who stand in the fore front, should fall, we fall not alone: if we slide from the path of truth, who amongst us will be able to stand!</P>
<P>We ought to be endued with the spirit of wisdom, of judgment, and with sound minds; which he hath promised to them that ask this blessing from him, and hath made good his promise.</P>
<P><HI>Are you in health, my brethren?</HI> are you strongly attached to the promotion and exaltation of that glori∣ous cause which you have embarked in? have each of you a share in, and a proper care of the LORD'S work? do you watch over the flock attending on your ministry, under the great shepherd, and with the tenderness of gospel love <HI>seeking to save that which was lost?</HI></P>
<P>I freely confess my own fears, that I am not in a state of perfect health and sound mind; labouring as I ought in the work of the LORD. As it is a task of the ut∣most importance, I ought to remain ever diffident of my own care, and to watch daily in the discharge of a trust so great and important as that of the recovery and preservation <HI>of the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</HI></P>
<P>The prostration of the soul before the GOD and Fa∣ther of mercies, in a cause of such infinite concern, is a continual duty, which can scarce ever be sufficiently discharged, The secret cry of my soul has, after this
<PB N="26" REF="016777_0025_0F9E2EF44D2791A8"/>manner, frequently arisen, "LORD! spare thy people and bless thine heritage." I am fully persuaded, my friends, were all the ministers and elders more blessed with sound health, the minds of the flock would be more filled with brotherly kindness, and more and more approach to that state which I have mentioned; they would know what is meant by the <HI>angels being spirits,</HI> and how to understand his <HI>ministers being a flame of fire.</HI></P>
<P>I come now to another class, whom I mean to ad∣dress under the title of those within the audience of my voice, who continue in a single state.</P>
<P><HI>Are you in health; my brethren and sisters?</HI> are you possest of inward virtue, and of ability to live to GOD, as becometh his saints; and which alone will lead you to eternal life: do you aspire after these, with an una∣bated zeal?</P>
<P>You must not expect always to rest satisfied with the good things of this life. The day may come when you will loath the abundance of your temporal possessi∣ons: you will then be concerned that you have so in∣dulgently<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Haggai. i. 4, &amp;c.</NOTE> <HI>dwelt in cieled houses, and have let the house of God lie waste.</HI> Then you would be glad to have exchanged the fading pleasures of life for the sub∣stantial joys of eternity.</P>
<P>Recollect yourselves in the spring time of life; con∣sider early the importance of this exchange, while you have it in your power to make it. Look up to an ob∣ject more glorious than the present world can afford you, even to the joys of that eternal inheritance, which <HI>the children of the first-born, the innumerable company of happy spirits, the general assembly of just men already
<PB N="27" REF="016777_0026_0F9E2EF4CB4A6568"/>made perfect,</HI> are replenished with.—Pleasures unspeak∣able! that exist for evermore!</P>
<P><HI>Art thou in health, my brother?</HI>—my dear brethren, are ye fervently engaged in labouring, necessary labour∣ing, for the promotion of the cause of GOD upon earth?</P>
<P>O ye parents and heads of families, who are pla∣ced as delegated shepherds over them; timely beware, lest the blood of your children, or of any part of your charge, fall on your heads: (if through your misconduct they become corrupted, and their souls perish.) Know that inquisition for blood will hasten from the supreme judge, who hath divided the classes of mankind; and, as it were, separated from the rest those who are parents, and have children:—his call is to these, <Q>Go work in my vineyard.</Q></P>
<P>These precious gifts which he hath given, as pledges of his love, are to be led and instructed by them with a proper authority.</P>
<P>If the parents experimentally felt the advantages of spiritual health in themselves, then would they be con∣cerned that the tender minds of their children should be properly cultivated with the knowledge of the LORD, and a fearful apprehension of transgressing his supreme commands. They would teach them to look further than mere temporal acquisitions; even to GOD their Creator. They would bring them up in the nur∣ture and fear of the LORD; in order that their minds might be filled from the store house and magazine of boundless good, and early enriched with the joys of GOD'S salvation: and <HI>this</HI> would naturally diffuse the greatest satisfaction to the parents themselves, to see their children become the delight and ornaments of hu∣man nature, and fitted for a glorious change! <HI>the com∣pany of Angels, and the spirits of just men made per∣fect.</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="016777_0027_0F9E2EF83ADF4618"/>The ties of nature, and the stronger ties of gra∣titude to him who gave the blessing, call aloud for teach∣ing the tender minds of your children, to walk in the safe and delightful paths of virtue. With what satis∣faction and composure of mind will such parents be enabled to answer the great GOD, upon his awful exa∣mination to this purpose: <Q>What have you done with those tender sheep which I committed to your care in the wilderness? have you trained them up in safe∣ty?</Q>—How will such parents be supported by a con∣sciousness of having done their duty, in that solemn hour!—They then may truly say, <Q>I have done my utmost within my contracted sphere, within the nar∣row precincts of my allotment in life, to fill up my stated duty.</Q> Then the supreme judge will set at his right hand such parents, and they shall be united to him in glory.</P>
<P>And I beseech you parents, elders, ministers, (and I include myself) let us all say Amen, to this solemn care in our respective families; let us all discharge our several duties as men, hoping for the coming of our LORD; who then will say unto us, <Q>Well done, good and faithful servants,</Q> even in that hour when he shall come with terrors to make inquisition for blood thro' the various ranks, whether ministers, elders, heads of families, even throughout the various classes of man∣kind.</P>
<P>I wish all parents and heads of families would conti∣nually walk, hand in hand with their children and fa∣milies, in the path which leadeth to life eternal; daily watching over, and improving their rising judgments, with the wisdom which cometh from above; instruct∣ing and encouraging them in the contemplation of di∣vine things! persuading them to believe, as the truth is, that the things of this world are all uncertain, and fading away! that they have everlasting mansions erect∣ed
<PB N="29" REF="016777_0028_0F9E2EF91AB27900"/>for them in the city of their GOD; where (if they fall not short, or turn not aside) they will enjoy the company of saints and angels for ever more.</P>
<P><HI>Are you in health; my brethren and sisters?</HI></P>
<P>Exercise yourselves in this your present state, diffe∣rently from those, whose faculties are bounded within the narrow limits of this world; cultivate, continually cultivate, the minds of your offspring: endeavouring to raise in them a proper comprehension of the dignity of their natures, and to fix in them early a steady be∣lief of their <HI>immortality;</HI> which is of the utmost im∣portance to all?</P>
<P>The hearts of those are unsound, who live in a per∣petual attachment to the pride of life, who are conta∣minated with the love of the world, wherein their chief happiness appears to be placed: how can such point out the way to the city of GOD? how can they say to their children, <Q>Let us retreat from the world, from this scene of corruption; let us withdraw from the cares, the solicitudes of life: let us ascend to our appointed home: let us contemplate the joys of eternity: let nothing separate us from that blessed hope!</Q></P>
<P>How can parents thus address their children, when they have, perhaps, for a long course of years, ceased to consider the awful importance of the subject; and their own minds continue fixed, and tied down to the fading enjoyments of life! Alas! that the folly and va∣nity of the superfluous pleasures of the world should so entirely engage and engross the attention of any one immortal individual, as to take up almost every mo∣ment of their precious time!</P>
<P>Hence, sometimes, parents, instead of instructing the minds of their children, have so totally corrupted
<PB N="30" REF="016777_0029_0F9E2EFA76C5F130"/>their own, that they have laid obstructions in the way to the immortal happiness of their offspring, and, when their children have for a time trod in the ways of reli∣gion and virtue, they have been so extremely corrupt themselves, as to oppose them in their passage; to ob∣struct them, with violence, in their way to glory; and thereby aggravated their own guilt beyond expression; alas! what will their punishment prove, when convict∣ed of so great a neglect and violation of their duty? when he that is the judge of quick and dead shall ap∣pear in judgment, to render to every man according to his works! May all parents, who are negligent in the discharge of their duties, lay it seriously to heart.</P>
<P>In the mean time, may you, my brethren and sisters in a spiritual relation, continue in a state of lively, ac∣tive health—labouring in the sure ground of hope; that, <HI>when the great shepherd himself shall appear, you may also appear with him in glory.</HI> If you so persist, I cannot but yet hope, that your stedfast continuance will prove the means of spreading spiritual health, in an eminent degree. For as, on the one hand, minds infected and vitiated <HI>with the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye, or the pride of life,</HI> are very apt to spread the contagion to all that are round about them: so, on the other hand, such as are restored by CHRIST, to a state of spiritual health, and by him steadily preserved in it, often become instrumental in his hand, to diffuse that blessing; from whence, healthy parents have been frequently observed to have healthy children.</P>
<P>I am convinced that the LORD is at work amongst the rising generation; many of whom stand convicted in their own minds, of the want of spiritual health; and are imploring the mercy of the GOD of their sal∣vation.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="016777_0030_0F9E2EFACEAA3DF0"/>
In order to your attaining it, let me call upon you again, the present rising generation; whose stations in life may be likely to have some little continuance; be ever stedfast in the performance of your religious duties, that you may become heirs of the kingdom; and have your portion, with the children of GOD.</P>
<P>It seems to me of the greatest importance, in relati∣on to the various affairs of life, to form aright the minds of youth; and therefore, I once more entreat every pa∣rent present, that you watch over, and carefully nourish every seed of virtue springing up in the minds of your children, for the sake of their, and of your own, tem∣poral welfare; as well as for the hope and assurance of both their, and your own, eternal happiness.</P>
<P>And here, let me class every single individual; as every single individual is posting on his way to an eter∣nal state of existence—and that they may be guided by infinite wisdom, is my earnest desire; and be at last received into glory! welcomed thither by their dear Redeemer!</P>
<P>In this city he hath laid his hand upon one, and upon another. He hath preserved many from the pollutions that too frequently reign in the world; and hath merci∣fully induced some to look early into the law of liberty, into the counsel of his will, who thereby learn the things which belong to their peace.</P>
<P><HI>Art thou in health; my brother?</HI> Art thou not only <HI>called from</HI> a state of <HI>darkness, into his marvellous light;</HI> but, obedient to the call, entered upon the road to eternal glory? Art thou in health; my fellow pilgrim?</P>
<P>A sense of the want of that food which CHRIST gives, is at least a symptom of life.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="016777_0031_0F9E2EFB91FE9140"/>
I believe it may be said concerning some among you, as was said formerly to CHRIST; <HI>Lord, he whom thou lovest is sick.</HI> The decay of health in many, has been owing to foul feeding; to their daily feeding upon the spirit, maxims and manners of the world, upon exteri∣or appearances, upon comparative righteousness, upon a comparison of their present, with their former state; whose minds are relaxed with the love and spirit of va∣nity. Some have relaxed into evil, and are now be∣come too much unacquainted with GOD and his law; which, to holiness, and to <HI>that</HI> only, annexes happi∣ness. Many of these might have gone on from one degree of strength to another; had they not too much regarded the things of time, and fed too greedily up∣on the temptations and pleasures of this Life; not enough considering, that the diseases and disorders of the mind thus fed, must certainly at last bring death, even the <HI>death,</HI> tho' not <HI>dissolution,</HI> of the soul. They might have been cloathed, if not with a perfect heart, yet with a certain degree of strength; and been more and more advanced on their way to the regions of bliss.</P>
<P>I beseech you, continue in your love to the gos∣pel of CHRIST: that, day after day, you may feed on the holy sacrifice, and on that eternal fruit with which he nourishes the soul that <HI>hungers and thirsts after righteousness.</HI> And, I cannot help, while I am speak∣ing, pressing you in a more immediate manner, if pos∣sible, that, not relying on your own wisdom, and your own strength, but in a full dependance and leaning up∣on the breast of the beloved JESUS, you all, patiently, with a holy soundness, proceed in <HI>the highway to the city of God;</HI> that you may be crowned at last with glory, honour, and immortality!</P>
<P>I find in me (at least) one qualification of a gospel minister; even that of a strong and ardent love, which wisheth well to all mankind: and in particular that
<PB N="33" REF="016777_0032_0F9E2EFC4C07A6A0"/>you who are present, may enjoy such a state of per∣fect health, as I have been at this time enforcing to your serious consideration: may it spread through every class; may you all encrease in the stability of righteous∣ness, through this life; and may it carry you into the boundless joys of eternity, into that glorious city, not one of whose inhabitants, can say, "I am sick."</P>

<P><HI>If we are besides ourselves, it is unto God. If we are sober, it is for your sakes. Having known the terrors of the Lord for sin;</HI> having experienced a gra∣dual progression from the pit of pollution, from the mire and clay; <HI>having,</HI> in some measure, <HI>tasted of the good word of life, and of the powers of the world to come,</HI> we apprehend we have authority, more than any human laws or ordination of men can give us, to tell to others, what GOD hath done for our souls.

<P>We enter not into the ministerial office, with any application of this sort, viz.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Sam. ii. 36.</NOTE> <HI>Put me (I pray thee) into one of the priest's offices, that I may eat a piece of bread.</HI> We think higher of the gospel ministry; so that no temporary emolument can possibly be an ade∣quate inducement to us, to enter upon it; for <HI>the love of Christ constraineth us.</HI> We speak with reverence and a feeling heart; and we believe the Christian reli∣gion will never flourish, in its full perfection and ex∣cellency, 'till their being thus constrained, becomes the case of all that take the name of GOD in their mouths in a public manner.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 14.</NOTE> <HI>The love of Christ constraineth us; because we thus judge that if one died for all, then were all dead. And that he died for all, that they which live, should not henceforth live to themselves, but to him that died for them, and rose again.</HI></P>
<P>This expression seems to me, if properly considered, to cast no inconsiderable light upon the propriety of that query applied to us, viz. <HI>How much owest thou
<PB N="36" REF="016777_0035_0F9E2F01CD50A160"/>unto my Lord?</HI> which I cannot yet relinquish; though so he may think I dwell upon it too long. <HI>The love of Christ constraineth us, because if one died for all, then were all dead.</HI> I look upon this as a fundamental part of the Christian faith; <HI>and that life and immortality</HI> have been <HI>brought to light by the gospel.</HI> We were all dead: we have all partaken of guilt: we have all been in a state of estrangement from the covenant of GOD: we have all become, more or less,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephes. ii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>aliens to the com∣monwealth of Israel.</HI></P>
<P>In this state of death the voice of GOD hath been signally extended unto mankind. I have sometimes considered with great attention, his declaration,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hos. xiii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>O! death, I will be thy plagues;</HI> and it hath made a deep impression upon my mind. This declaration of the most high GOD, hath been amply verified in the experience of all, who have been quickened into a life of piety. <HI>Christ</HI> hath been <HI>the resurrection and the life</HI> to all such. Tho' <HI>death</HI> hath <HI>come upon all,</HI> we are not all included under death; so as to be left without the quickening vivi∣fying power, that is offered to raise the dead to life.</P>
<P><HI>The dead have heard the voice of the Son of God!</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">John v. 25.</NOTE> and have been raised again to life. I cannot think but it has been the experience of divers, within the audience of my voice, who know the certainty of this important truth, tho' others may reflect upon me, as being beside myself; yet, if so, I may say with the apostle, <HI>it is unto God.</HI> But I would gladly speak intel∣ligibly to the soul that is on its way to the regions of im∣mortality; for if we are sober, <HI>it is for your sakes.</HI> I would ask whether a secret something hath not often vi∣sited your souls, an unspeakable something, often se∣cretly and immediately attended, that hath engaged you to send up heavenly and earnest wishes, and raised in
<PB N="37" REF="016777_0036_0F9E2F032CC040C8"/>your minds strong aspirations, or breathings, after GOD? when we are told that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 21, 22.</NOTE> <HI>the whole creation groaneth together in bondage until now,</HI> we have no doubt of its being relative and applicable to the present times, or such times of longing after GOD, to be delivered by him.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 45 &amp; 47.</NOTE> <HI>The Lord from heaven is the quickening spi∣rit.</HI> An expression of want, from a real sense of it, is an evidence of life; or being raised by him, from a state of death. We have not been left in a dead state; this prediction hath been verified, <HI>O! death I will be thy plagues.</HI> He hath brought the first evidence of life, which is a sense of want. The spiritually dead, have received it; and it hath been of his pure mercy, that he hath followed us from time to time; hath met us, as it were, in a narrow place, with instructions and reproofs, and secretly raised up in us the hidden life of his own divine wisdom; he hath caused the animating and warming beams of the sun of righteousness to break forth. And, yet more, the word which called <HI>Laza∣rus out</HI> of the <HI>grave,</HI> hath already, in a good degree, raised some of us to life, even life eternal! hence<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 54.</NOTE> <HI>death is swallowed up in victory!</HI></P>
<P>And therefore <HI>the love of Christ constraineth us, be∣cause he hath proved "the plagues of our death."</HI> He not only died, but the immediate manifestation of his quickening spirit had led <HI>captivity captive,</HI> that we, by him, may triumph over the united powers of darkness.</P>
<P>We follow not formally; but we believe in, and are convinced, fully convinced, of the doctrines of the christian religion, the incarnation, glory, life, death, mighty miracles, and various circumstances, relative to the holy life of JESUS,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Isai. liii. 7.</NOTE> <HI>as in the volume of the book it is written;</HI> and can, in an awful and reverent sense, commemorate those vast and most interesting events.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="016777_0037_0F9E2F04404C7E08"/>
We admire, with humble hearts and minds, the aw∣ful transactions of that time, when sweat, like drops of blood, ran from the face of the holy JESUS! when, being in an agony, he prayed more earnestly! when he was betrayed, his sacred head crowned with thorns! his face spit upon! he was most ignominiously treated, and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xi. 7.</NOTE> as <HI>a sheep before her shearers is dumb,</HI> he complained not!</P>
<P>We behold him, in his agonies on Calvary Mount, offering himself as a sacrifice for the sins of the whole world; that he might purify us, by the shedding of his precious blood! <HI>more precious than the blood of goats and lambs;</HI> or any other that was shed under the law. We believe in his amazing mercy, in offering himself there; when, loaden with the immense weight of the sins of mankind, and the immediate sense of the fa∣ther's presence withdrawn, he was left to suffer alone; under this extreme pressure crying out, <HI>Eloi, Eloi, la∣ma Sabacthani!</HI> was crucified! dead! and buried.</P>
<P>Here pause a little, I beseech you!—contemplate the adorable theme! acknowledge, O man! that un∣bounded gratitude, which is ever due from thee: O! my soul, <HI>how much thou owest unto thy Lord!</HI></P>
<P>I know we have been stigmatized, as disbelieving the truths of the Christian religion. However, I call the divine record, the SAVIOUR of the world, that was of∣fered a sacrifice without the gate of Jerusalem, to wit∣ness for my belief, that he was sent from <HI>God,</HI> to do the <HI>father's will:</HI> and I do, without controversy, believe that he was.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iii. 16.</NOTE> <HI>God manifest in the flesh, justified in the spirit, believed on in the world, and received up into glory.</HI> We do not at all doubt that<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 19.</NOTE> <HI>God</HI> was <HI>in Christ reconciling the world unto himself.</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. ii. 6.</NOTE> <HI>That Christ gave
<PB N="39" REF="016777_0038_0F9E2F049FF79BE8"/>himself a ransom for all, to be testified in due time;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. iii. 5.</NOTE> <HI>that with his stripes we are healed.</HI></P>
<P>By virtue of that holy sacrifice the remission of sins is gained; the awakening power of that sentence which is due to sin is felt in a state of alienation from GOD; and as we believe, that if one <HI>died for all, then were all dead;</HI> so, we believe that he who was crucified, dead, and buried, likewise triumphed over the grave, and now <HI>sitteth at the right hand of God,</HI> in a glorified bo∣dy, to make intercession for man, in order that he might effectually purchase, and redeem to himself, a people to the praise of his name; and diffuse, through∣out his universal empire, a similarity of opinion and na∣ture, arising from the experience of his universal re∣deeming love.</P>
<P>I am no Arian, far from it:—I believe in the clear emphatic testimonies laid down in holy writ, that CHRIST was more than a prophet. I repeat my belief that he suffered, died, ascended, and is now come<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 28.</NOTE> <HI>the second time, without sin, to salvation;</HI> in order to reconcile the world to himself. I know many are wil∣ling to admit that he died for all, as all were in a state of death; and that, by the imputation of his righte∣ousness, all are justified in the sight of GOD. Where∣as I think it more just to proceed in the language of the holy inspired apostle; that <HI>they which live, should not henceforth live to themselves; but to him who died for them, and rose again;</HI> that there may be an ef∣fectual redemption, a thorough change; not the impu∣tation of <HI>righteousness,</HI> without <HI>works;</HI> but a <HI>real substantial righteousness</HI> in the <HI>heart</HI> and <HI>life;</HI> which may operate upon, and regulate the mind and will, and lead us to a conformity to his divine nature: not a righteousness imputed to us from what CHRIST did
<PB N="40" REF="016777_0039_0F9E2F0560B39CD0"/>and suffered without us; but a righteousness raised by him within us; thro' our surrendering ourselves to his government, and yielding entire submission to his heart-cleansing, refining power.</P>
<P>However this doctrine may relish with some, I am convinced he died for all, that all should be saved; that, through him, we might be justified in the sight of GOD; that we might put on <HI>the Lord Jesus Christ, with all his divine affections.</HI></P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 22.</NOTE> <HI>The whole creation of God groaneth together,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. v. 22.</NOTE> <HI>to be cloathed upon with a house from heaven;</HI> not an ima∣ginary house, and an imaginary righteousness; but, to be cloathed upon with the grace of compleat salvation; to put on the LORD JESUS CHRIST; having first put off the old man, with all his works, and with all his corrupt wisdom, or knowledge; which puffeth up, in∣stead of that charity which edifieth.</P>
<P><HI>Christ is</HI> made unto us <HI>Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption.</HI></P>
<P>In remembering therefore that he died for us, let us consider what follows: <HI>that henceforth, we should not live to ourselves.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gal. ii. 20.</NOTE> <HI>I am crucified with Christ,</HI> says one of the apostles, as a private person: and it should or ought to be the language in truth of each individual, thro' all succeeding ages. <HI>Nevertheless, I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.</HI> He is become my righ∣teousness; not by imputation only—but he actually li∣veth in me: and the life which I now live, is by the faith of the Son of GOD. I think I may now say,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>let us press forward toward the mark of the prize of the high calling of God.</HI> Let us be crucified with CHRIST, <HI>crucified to the world, and the world to us.</HI></P>

O! my friends, for such I term you in the course of that universal love, which reacheth forth to the whole human race, which floweth from him who hath thus wrought for me, and <HI>brought life and immortality to light</HI> in my soul. Is any one of you desirous of being in∣formed, <HI>how much owest thou unto my Lord?</HI>—lay hold on his offers of redemption; live in his fear, in fellowship with him, <HI>in communion with the church of the first born, whose names are written in heaven:</HI> so will you far better know than any one on earth can ever inform you.</P>
<P>Examine the rising suggestions of your own minds: you are not formed to live merely to yourselves, merely within the contracted bounds of human privileges, in the narrow limits of mortality. Consider the dignity of your nature; you are formed for the most glorious purposes.</P>
<P>I earnestly wish the rising youth would lay these things seriously' to heart, and often meditate upon them, as one formerly did; who thus expresses himself,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxix. 3, 4.</NOTE> <HI>while I was musing the fire burned. My heart was hot with∣in me; then spake I with my tongue, Lord! make me to know my end, and the measure of my days, what it is, that I may know how frail I am.</HI>—That they would contemplate the great design of providence, with re∣gard to their immortality, which would lessen their es∣teem of the unsubstantial joys of time, and engage them to pursue those which are <HI>unspeakable and full of glory</HI> for ever. <HI>While I was musing the fire burned.</HI></P>
<P>Continue this musing, this state of meditation; prize the invitations of the spirit of CHRIST, mercifully ex∣tended to your immortal spirits; and let your minds mount upwards: remember your pious predecessors, now perhaps in glory; and their connections in the
<PB N="42" REF="016777_0041_0F9E2F06CB7DC5C0"/>world of spirits: likewise put this question to yourselves, upon every serious occasion, <HI>How much owest thou un∣to my Lord?</HI></P>
<P>I am fully convinced were the Christian world in ge∣neral to leave out exterior ceremonies, and enter more into this inward meditation, their minds would be more largely replenished with divine fruits; and those who are entering as it were upon the wilderness of this world, would then partake of the advantage. O! that we might all live in the beauty of holiness!</P>
<P><HI>My heart was hot within me; then spake I with my tongue!</HI>—A necessary preparation for a preacher! Abel's offering, on account of such a preparation, was <HI>more acceptable to God than his brother's.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then spake I with my tongue.</HI>—O! rising genera∣tion, what you speak with your tongues, let it be from the same good source of hearts divinely prepared; since on the other hand for every <HI>idle word</HI> that men speak, they must <HI>give an account in the day of judgment.</HI> As you often speak with your tongues, fervently desire that the sacred faculties of the mind may be fitted for divine meditations, and the tongue to publish for the honour of GOD and benefit of others, what you have been taught by him: so will you never admit or utter any thing con∣trary to the divinity of CHRIST JESUS your LORD.</P>
<P><HI>Lord, let me know mine end!</HI> O that this sound may dwell upon your minds, who are the hope of the next generation! upon whom the weighty trust and care of the cause of GOD must, in a little time, necessarily devolve; that you may come to the knowledge of the <HI>measure of your days.</HI> I think, without violence to the text, you may learn from it that you are destined for immortality: but the love of worldly things is too apt to engage the attention of that immortal part, the
<PB N="43" REF="016777_0042_0F9E2F0A57F16500"/>soul; which occasions, too many, the want of their know∣ing the great and glorious end for which they were formed, <HI>a little lower than the angels,</HI> and intended to be <HI>crowned with glory and honour.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Lord! let me know my end and the measure of my days!</HI></P>
<P>I tremble methinks upon the brink of eternity! and so, with a little proper reflection, you might say all; the aged, the middle aged, and the youth.—The end of all things is at hand: flatter not yourselves therefore with length of days, and a long prosperity of worldly posses∣sions; suffer me to beseech you for the sake of your immortal souls.</P>
<P><HI>What do I owe to my God?—What do I not owe him?</HI>—He hath snatched me as a brand out of the fire; and I would not, tho' to gain the world, tread back again in the path of folly.</P>
<P>I know it by experience, and therefore I would per∣suade you, not to turn aside from the GOD of your sal∣vation; but to acknowledge the infinite debt you owe him, and to pay him daily with obedience, adoration and praise.</P>
<P>Our sins have been great, and our transgressions <HI>ne∣ver</HI> could have been obliterated, had not CHRIST done it for us; let us therefore no longer dwell upon the <HI>rock</HI> of <HI>presumption</HI> with <HI>Satan,</HI> who hath been a lyar from the beginning; but let us rather <HI>descend</HI> into the <HI>valley</HI> of <HI>humility and peace,</HI> and <HI>settle accounts</HI> with the GOD of our <HI>lives,</HI> from whom I had strayed to that degree that my life became a burden to me, and I have wished that I had never been born; but CHRIST, who was <HI>a friend to publicans and sinners,</HI> is now become <HI>the rock of my salvation!</HI> he hath caused me to trust in him, and to seek the LORD my GOD. The debt I owe is
<PB N="44" REF="016777_0043_0F9E2F0B7121F120"/>infinite, I desire ever to acknowledge it with all possible gratitude; and to do my utmost towards the discharge of it, while I have my being.</P>
<P>If there is a soul within the audience of my voice which (upon this awful query) <HI>How much owest thou unto my Lord?</HI> is ready to apprehend, that it owes too much ever to hope for a discharge, or freedom from the heavy load of debt it has contracted; I have a little to say to such, even from my own experience: thy trans∣gressions do not exceed the bounds of his mercy; he still careth for thee, with an inexpressible fatherly care and tenderness. Even when his afflictions are upon thee they are intended for thy good. <HI>The bruised reed he will not break, the smeaking flax he will not quench.</HI> The more any of you see your real state, the more you remember the favours you have received, and feel the burthen of your injustice and ingratitude; the more readily will he meet the penitent disposition of your minds.</P>
<P>I have no manner of doubt but he, <HI>whose work is salvation,</HI> who <HI>came into the world</HI> purely and purpose∣ly <HI>to save sinners,</HI> will carry on his own work, and, as you wholly resign yourselves to his forming hand, will purify your hearts, reconcile you to the Father, and make you everlasting instances and monuments of his Infinite mercy. List up therefore thy head in hope, whoever thou art, in this humbled penitent state; for <HI>thy salvation draws nigh.</HI> Thou owest abundance to thy LORD; and there is an abundance which thou canst ne∣ver pay: but there is the good <HI>Samaritan,</HI> ever ready to do for thee, as for him, who going from <HI>Jerusalem to Jericho, fell among robbers;</HI> by whom he was wounded; <HI>and</HI> to say, <HI>take care of him, and I will pay.</HI> There is a glorious sound from the great and good <HI>friend</HI> of <HI>publicans</HI> and <HI>sinners;</HI> he is ready to say to thee who art in this penitent state before him,
<PB N="45" REF="016777_0044_0F9E2F0CDBA98B00"/><HI>Take thy bill and write down fifty.</HI> He will<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. xliv. 22.</NOTE> <HI>blot out thy sins as a cloud, and thy transgressions as a thick cloud.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot but remember with renewed feeling, and warm emotion of heart, the day that anxiety (in the view of my condition) seized me; and how his mercy relieved me from it. He made my soul feel his com∣passion, and in the depth of gratitude thankfully to a∣dore him. And hence I often feel a tenderness of mind toward those who are weary of vanity, and heavy la∣den with a sense of their manifold transgressions. I beseech such, by the mercy of GOD, that they would fly to him in their anguish of mind; for it is he, and he alone that can speak peace to the sinner: tho' your unrighteousness may be great, it is not in any degree of proportion, to his infinite mercy! Again, such a∣mong you to whom I have spoke, who delight to dwell in the path of temptation, wherein you have too long continued; I warn you to consider, that you are in the road to destruction.</P>
<P>I would not give up, like Esau,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>my birth-right</HI> to seek <HI>a place of repentance with tears, and not to find it.</HI> O my soul! for ever acknowledge how much thou owest unto thy LORD! Let none say <Q>he hath blessed me variously, and in some future time I will awake my soul to gratitude, I have now something else to do;</Q> like him who, when an apostle<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Acts xxiv. 25.</NOTE> reasoned <HI>of righteousness, temperance and judgment to come,</HI> replied <HI>go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season I will call for thee.</HI></P>
<P>The like disposition continues to prevail in too many: and this seems to be the language of their hearts, <Q>Go thy way this time; call upon me when I have lived
<PB N="46" REF="016777_0045_0F9E2F0D918820F0"/>to myself, and answered my own purposes a little longer; visit me at some distant time hence.</Q> Oh! rather <HI>to-day, while it is called to-day,—Harden not thy heart:</HI> do not defer thy repentance a moment; thou knowest not what <HI>a moment may produce.</HI> Consider thy repeated transgressions; thy multiplied offences a∣gainst GOD: heap not up <HI>wrath against the day of wrath:</HI> swell not the dreadful account. Thou hast hitherto trampled upon the goodness and the mercies of the GOD that made thee; venture not on presumption and delay. Time is uncertain: Immortality is at hand.</P>
<P>I beseech you therefore my friends at the present time, that you will lay to heart the necessity of your making up this great account: delay it not to the de∣cline of life. Many are on the brink of the grave! reflect upon your extreme danger! think not of crowd∣ing the account of your repentance into your last hour of life! You will find it extremely difficult to labour under the infirmities of the body, upon a death-bed, without a reasonable ground of hope: all the offers of mercy having been long continued, and often repeated; yet by you as long slighted, and as often rejected; what then will discharge you from that dreadful account! I wish it may never be the case of any within the audience of my voice. Let us all immediately ponder, rightly consider, and seriously improve this consideration, <HI>How much owest thou unto my Lord?</HI></P>

<HEAD>A <HI>PRAYER</HI> upon <HI>May</HI> the 19th, which concluded the afternoon service of that day, at the <HI>Fryer's</HI> Meeting.</HEAD>
<P>WITH unspeakable reverence we presume to approach thy presence, O Father! who art in heaven and, with the voice of thanks∣giving and holy praise, to offer the tribute, that is due to Thee alone!</P>
<P>In a commemoration of thy mercy, thy infinite mer∣cy! we are awfully bowed before thee, as at thy sacred foot-stool; in the deepest reverence and thankfulness, for the stretching forth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxiii. 4.</NOTE> <HI>of the rod and the staff,</HI> which thou hast been pleased to bless, as the means of our furtherance in the way of life and salvation.</P>
<P>Though humbled in dust, in the sense of our un∣worthiness, we are, nevertheless, encouraged to breathe unto Thee; to make mention of thy name, with joy of heart: we adore that goodness, which hath put it into our hearts to seek, serve and fear Thee; and to turn to the place where<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 13.</NOTE> <HI>prayer is wont to be made.</HI></P>
<P>Thou hast loved us before we loved Thee: thy love, O LORD! hath not been after the manner of men: Thou hast called us, when we were enemies; and hast reconciled transgressiors to thyself. Thou hast followed us in the day of our revolting; and, when we were straying in the wilderness, as a most gracious and tender shepherd Thou didst lay thy hand on us, not only with judgment, but with mercy; and hast
<PB N="48" REF="016777_0047_0F9E2F0F33424C98"/>brought us home again unto thy flock, and thy fold, and forgiven us our multiplied transgressions.</P>
<P>Our deviations from thy holy path have not been punished with inexorable justice; but thy conduct to∣ward us has been cloathed with unspeakable compassion. O! Thou everlasting shepherd, and bishop of our souls! who hast looked upon us, when weltering as in our blood, and by thy divine power hast healed us. Thou, that art the physician of our souls, hast cared for us, when <HI>the priest and the levite</HI> past us by.—When cast out and surrounded with the woes of unutterable distress: when thick clouds covered us,—Thou in thy abundant love<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. xviii. 9.</NOTE> <HI>bowed the heavens and came down</HI> to our help, <HI>and all the darkness was put under thy Feet!</HI> Thou hast made the <HI>clouds thy chariot,</HI> and walked <HI>upon the wings of the wind,</HI> for our deliverance; when our iniqui∣ties, like floods, rose high, and appeared unto us like to swallow us up in everlasting confusion! O! adorable condescension! We have no language to express thy mercy, and the boundless obligations we lie under to thy Majesty! who hast thus, in the times of unspeaka∣ble anxiety, vouchsafed to appear for us: and even when we have wandered from the counsel of thy will, and trod in the path of the wicked,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. xliii. 3.</NOTE> <HI>Thou sentest forth thy light and thy truth, and didst lead us back to thy holy hill.</HI></P>
<P>We acknowledge all these blessings to thy praise, O! shepherd of <HI>Israel!</HI> who <HI>sleepest not by day,</HI> nor <HI>slumberest by night.</HI></P>
<P>To thee we owe all our faculties, and all that is with∣in us; and let them all, we pray Thee, be consecrated to thy honour: we beseech that all our steps may be directed to Thee; and more and more to thy service. For, Father of infinite kindness! it hath pleased Thee
<PB N="49" REF="016777_0048_0F9E2F0FCAE14B28"/>to rank us among thy children; to make <HI>our dwelling with thy light; our habitation with the lifting up of the smiles of thy countenance:</HI> and to remove every ob∣stacle to a perfect communion with Thee: the power is in thy hands; sanctify us thoroughly to this end; write the inscription of holy and heavenly characters upon our hearts; and, Oh! grant that we may still be preserved, through every trial and probation, to a peaceable admis∣sion into thy kingdom.</P>
<P>Blot out all our transgressions! forgive us freely, for thy dear Son's sake! remember us in the midst of thy mercy! deliver us, we pray Thee, as thou hast graci∣ously hitherto done, like a tender Father.</P>
<P>Grant we may never forget thy counsel; sooner cut the thread of our lives, and number us to the silent grave!</P>
<P>May we follow Thee, with our whole hearts, submit to the patient resignation of our all, for thy dear service; and keep us to a happy conclusion in thy favour! it is all we ask, and beg at thy hand: with regard to outward circumstances, thy will be done! we have no other sup∣plication to offer.</P>
<P>Preserve us, as in the hollow of thy hand; that from a militant state here, we may pass to a triumphant one, in thy everlasting kingdom!</P>
<P>O LORD! have mercy on thy people, and thy chil∣dren, when they spread their hands towards thy holy habitation. Cloath them with the spirit of grace and supplication. Excite them to fly to Thee, their only rock and refuge; and to thy name, that is an impreg∣nable defence; where the righteous, in all ages, have ever found safety!</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="016777_0049_0F9E2F12B4B1AB78"/>
Regard those who are far off, and remain unacquaint∣ed with thy name. We pray Thee, let the same mer∣cy spread to <HI>them,</HI> which Thou hast shewed unto <HI>us.</HI> Let the diffusion of thy spiritual blessings, in and through thy dear Son, flow among them, that they may seek Thee; that a holy anxiety of mind may take place, in order to a rest in the day of trouble; and that when the various trials and troubles of time are over, they having, through thy abundant goodness and sure sup∣port, <HI>fought the good fight, and kept the faith,</HI> may be received by Thee, and be crowned with glory and immortality, in thy everlasting kingdom!</P>
<P>Oh thou that art fairer than the sons of men! grace flows from thy lips; Thou beholdest us when tempted, and speaks to our states with all the language of ten∣derness, Father of mercy! grant that innumerable multitudes may resort to thy temple, that sacred house, which thou hast erected to thy honour and service. May the poor, the sick, the maimed, the blind, and the naked, inspired by Thee with holy confidence, look towards <HI>Zion;</HI> and be cloathed by Thee, with the wed∣ding garment; with the righteousness of their dear SAVIOUR!</P>
<P>Thus, gracious GOD! we are divinely encouraged to supplicate thy name, on the behalf of the church mi∣litant, wherever scattered; that it may flourish in peace and stability; that, not only in part, but in the whole lustre of meridian brightness and splendor, they may commemorate thy glory!</P>
<P>In an humble sense of thy mercy and goodness to the workmanship of thy hands, we thank Thee, that Thou hast been pleased so abundantly to manifest thy loving kindness and favour, in and amongst us.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="016777_0050_0F9E2F13A17838D8"/>
We prostrate ourselves before the throne of thy Ma∣jesty and grace! we would offer to Thee an humble, grateful sacrifice of thanksgiving and praise, dominion, and every excellent attribute! for we know that we have nothing but from thy bounty, who art the rock of our salvation!</P>
<P>To Thee, Father of infinite mercy! for the multitude of thy mercies, in JESUS CHRIST our LORD!—To Thee, the author of every blessing! with the Son of thy bosom; our LORD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST, the Lamb immaculate thro' the eternal spirit, be all praise ascribed, now, henceforth, and for evermore. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The following SERMON was delivered at the Fryers Meeting in Bristol, on Friday the 22d Day of May, <HI>1767.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I HAVE frequently thought, and the sentiment hath been confirmed from my own observation and expe∣rience, that a great and excellent point would be gained, highly conducive to the advantage of mankind, did they generally, tho' from no surer guide than tradi∣tion, subscribe with heart and mind, to that certain truth, recorded in holy writ;</P>
<Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm lviii. 11.</NOTE> Verily, there is a reward for the righteous: Verily he is a God, that judgeth in the earth;</Q>
<P>As such a persuasion, from whatever ground it arises, naturally tends to influence the conduct, to avoid evil, and to pursue that which is good; and with regard to many, it hath proved a step to their nearer acquaintance with GOD, who is the only sure guide to true happiness.</P>
<P>Indeed I scarce think there can be many, if there be any, who are hardy enough to deny the existence of the supreme Being; but believe on the contrary, that many, through the divine favour enlightened to see their duty, and assisted to discharge it; do, in consequence of these favours, contemplate, with satisfaction inexpressible, these attributes of the most high GOD, here mentioned by the Psalmist: and could I be induced to think, that any part of mankind had swerved from their duty, for want of a firm conviction of those his attributes, as re∣lative
<PB N="56" REF="016777_0054_0F9E2F16943C11A8"/>to his creatures; and of the certainty, that there is really a GOD who judgeth the earth: I say, could I believe their minds were destitute of this animating and enlivening prospect of his power, omniscience, and goodness, in his superintendant care, and present judg∣ing the earth, I should deem such but a very little re∣moved, if any, from the state of the <HI>Athenians,</HI> upon whose altars the holy apostle discovered an inscription,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 23.</NOTE> <Q>"To the unknown God."</Q> Indeed a language that was spoken formerly hath been too much adopted by succeeding generations; numbers of whom have been like those men of Jerusalem, who said,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zeph. i. 12.</NOTE> <HI>the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</HI> Many (seduced by the grand deceiver and his agents) have endeavoured to estrange and withdraw themselves from the arbitrator of the whole earth: they have hence grown dark in their imaginations, and in like manner thus reasoned with themselves, <Q>He will do us no good, why therefore should we seek him? he will do us no harm; why should we fear him?</Q> This, we may justly look upon, as the most unhappy seduction of mind! as it misleads to the utmost distance, (without timely recovery) from that state of obedience, in which we are only capable of happiness, through the favourable notice of our father who is in heaven.</P>
<P>But we may justly conclude, that such impiety passed not the attention of an all-seeing GOD, in as much as he replied, <Q>I will punish those men of Jerusalem, who have said, The Lord doeth us no good, why should we seek him? he will not do us any harm, why should we fear him?</Q></P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="016777_0055_0F9E2F174BE03110"/>
The certainty of his superintendency, hath continued to be the happiness of all the wise and good in all ages; and it is these, and only these, that discern wherein true happiness consists. Hence hath it become, and still remains, an established glorious truth, accompanied with, and confirmed by, the voice of all generations.</P>
<P>Under this head in particular, a Petition or Prayer that was put up to him who hath created the earth, and assigned a reward to the righteous, by <HI>Agur</HI> the son of <HI>Jaketh,</HI> hath appeared to my mind, as necessary at this day to be adopted by every individual, who is desi∣rous of living to the best, wisest, and happiest purpose of life; without which they had better never have lived: And I cannot but recommend it most particularly to <HI>You,</HI> the rising generation, whose minds I trust are at times susceptible of proper impressions, who are not be∣come slaves to the vanity and lusts of the world: and indeed it seems like the language of one that is entering upon the stage of life:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxx. 7, 8, 9.</NOTE> <HI>Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not before I die! Remove far from me vanity and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me; lest I be full and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain!</HI></P>
<P>The substance of this memorable requisition hath ap∣peared to my mind, during the course of a long series of observations of men, and times; with regard to its im∣port in point of religion, virtue, the love and peace of God; as including indeed, all that is good and neces∣sary for our safe conduct and support through this life, to that completion of happiness, proposed as the final reward of the righteous.</P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="016777_0056_0F9E2F18495F5E48"/>
But how will some be able to prefer a petition to a power in whom, alas! they have no trust? who would gladly be possest of, and are much better pleased with, sharing a crown of wicked prosperity in this world, than with the prospect of a crown of pure and perfect felicity, in a state of endless futurity.</P>
<P>O that parents would timely and vigilantly exert themselves to raise early impressions in the tender minds of their children, in order to fix deeply the christian doctrine, with all its glorious consequences; firmly persuading and convincing them, that they are under the immediate notice of that Being, who is ever un∣speakably good, and gracious; and informing them, that he is cloathed with every awful, reverential attri∣bute; as being perfectly wise, powerful and good, yet strictly just; that he is the maker of us all; and that he delights to be called upon by us, with the tender and endearing appellation of, <Q>Our father, who art in heaven.</Q></P>
<P>Wherefore, under the deep and reverent sense of the certainty of his continual presence and providence, let us be ever careful, ever earnestly desirous to constitute a part of his children and family, in this our probationary state; that as we, by our rank in the creation, belong to the order of spirits; we may assuredly hope to join the cherubim and seraphim, in the habitations of glory and peace, by our now becoming members of his mili∣tant church; and may, when our warfare shall be accom∣plished, unite with the chorus of his triumphant hosts, in the language and tribute of grateful adoration and praise.</P>
<P>And indeed without this blessed hope, we are of all creatures, the most miserable! being daily surrounded with lamentation and woe! combating with secret or
<PB N="59" REF="016777_0057_0F9E2F1AD53CF748"/>obvious distresses! and encountring, from the cradle to the grave, a perpetual succession and variety of afflicti∣ons! We might therefore truly say, if our hopes were only fixed upon the transitory and fleeting pleasures of this life, we should be of all the animal creation, the most miserable! But we are assured, that nothing less than GOD himself, is the infinite and endless reward of all that diligently and constantly solicit him to the fol∣lowing purpose.—<HI>Two things have I required of thee, deny me them not before I die; remove far from me, vanity, and lies; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me, lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain!</HI></P>
<P>Which is as if the Prophet had said, <Q>Thou art my father, the author of my being; I made nothing my∣self, but am wholly and entirely the offspring of thy power and workmanship of thy hands: thou know∣est therefore what is best and fittest for me; and what can I require else from the hands of thee, O my GOD! than thy preservation out of the dangers of those opposite extremes in life; thy guidance in the middle path of safety and innocence, and the enjoyment of thy approbation and favour in my walking therein!</Q></P>
<P>His mind was doubtless deeply impressed with the awfulness and essential subject of his petition; and <HI>the removing far from him vanity and lies</HI> seems to consti∣tute a very considerable part of it. But too many of us, deviating from this one most important point, are daily inclined to wander in the broad path of vanity and folly, and prone to mistake it for the path of peace; 'till often∣times the stroke of adversity, of pain of body, or afflic∣tion of mind, convinceth <HI>in part,</HI> and, if unreformed, that of <HI>Death</HI> may <HI>fully</HI> convince us, when too late! of this most fatal mistake.</P>
<P><PB N="60" REF="016777_0058_0F9E2F1BB3AE3980"/>
The Prophet saw into the propriety of that frame of mind, which utters the language dictated by divine wis∣dom:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. iii. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Trust in the Lord with all thine heart, and lean not unto thine own understanding:</HI> inasmuch as his gracious superintendency and merciful notice of his crea∣tures is such as even<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. xlv. 22.</NOTE> <HI>taketh in the ends of the earth;</HI> and daily affordeth us the clearest manifestation of his goodness here, as it hath evidently pointed out to us that glorious path which leads to safety and eternal peace. But <HI>vanity and lies</HI> have too frequently estranged the mind, drawn it off from heavenly objects and heavenly cares, and fixed its attention upon things wholly unwor∣thy the notice of an immortal spirit. Under the sedu∣cing influence of <HI>vanity and lies,</HI> men have been fre∣quently led to pursue many things agreeable to their own wishes and imagined interests, without the least regard paid to justice and equity.</P>
<P>I may possibly observe an explanation and distinction of the two states as I go on, which <HI>Agur</HI> seems to refer to, viz. <HI>The distress and misery of the poor,</HI> on the one hand; and the <HI>vanity and pride of heart,</HI> too frequently conspicuous in the rich, on the other.</P>
<P>Were the lives of men designed to be wholly aliena∣ted from a state of justice and virtue, and entirely in∣structed and fixed in the maxims and manners of this world, singly to be taught to consider it as the chief end of their existence, there would then be some excuse for using every species of art in joining<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Isa. v. 8.</NOTE> <HI>house to house, and laying field to field, 'till there be no place, that they may be seated as it were alone in the midst of the earth:</HI> but now, as the great design of him who judg∣eth the earth, and rewardeth the righteous, hath been abundantly manifested and denounced to such as thus counter-act it, they who are intrusted with riches will
<PB N="61" REF="016777_0059_0F9E2F1D193022A8"/>appear the more inexcusable for their unbounded ava∣rice, and can have nothing to plead in favour of their violation of his plain and clear intentions respecting mankind. It will all at last be found <HI>vanity and lies,</HI> without virtue; without a faithful dedication of their hearts to the revealed will of GOD. It is an observation of the preacher that<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. 2. xxvi.</NOTE> <HI>God giveth to man that is good in his sight wisdom, and knowledge, and joy—but to the sinner he giveth travel; to gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good before God.</HI> And though he who is too unmindful of his creator, may have erected edifices that appear to the eye of the spec∣tator as if they would stand for ages, and may <HI>call them by his own name;</HI> yet even in this view, without virtue, he is, in the sense of <HI>Agur,</HI> a lyar to himself: he thinks he hath secured happiness, when the frame of his mind is the reverse of it; fixt probably in a state of exclusion, from what may be justly deemed true and substantial happiness; or any acquisition, which will be acceptable and well-pleasing in the sight of GOD. In this circum∣stance therefore he is a lyar. The by-stander indeed, who sees him in the free enjoyment of affluence, and taking his ease, in appearance, in the fulness of his heart, may be ready to conclude such a one happy, by being unacquainted with his secret griefs; whereas ma∣ny of his moments, if their true state could be pene∣trated into, would appear like those distressed ones of the king of Israel; who, when he was seated in the height of his splendor, magnificence, and royalty,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xxi. 27.</NOTE> <HI>rent his clothes; put on sackcloth, fasted, and lay in sack∣cloth, and went softly.</HI></P>

<P>Ye rising youth, whose minds are open to the dictates of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">James iii. 17.</NOTE> <HI>that wisdom which is from above,</HI> and to the just and tender sentiments which it inspires. Be your en∣quiries to the following purpose, frequent as they are important, <Q>What am I? Who made me? To what purpose was I created?</Q> dedicate your moments to the real purposes of life, pay not too great a regard to any prospects or temptations of this world; fix not your attention upon its maxims and proposed interests, which, when they become our idols, do but deceive and deprive us of infinitely greater; beware of being seduced by the out-goings of your own minds; let not things that are transient and perishing gain too great a possession of your hearts and affections; nor ever neglect the following in∣teresting petition, <HI>Remove far from me vanity and lies,</HI> and remember that he is the guide, helper, and director of all them that put their trust in him.</P>
<P><HI>Give me neither poverty nor riches;</HI> I readily con∣clude that in the first part of this petition all would will∣ingly join; but riches are most apt to lay hold of our hearts and affections: many indeed are the promises to the poor,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxxii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>Whom the Lord will deliver when he cri∣eth, even him that hath no helper;</HI> they are frequently encouraged to hope; while the rich, if they mis-apply the riches committed to their trust, we are assured by divine authority, will be constrained <HI>to weep and howl:</HI> they enjoy the blessing and bounty of Heaven, which they ought to apply to the noblest purposes, particularly the relief of their distressed brethren,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxv. 40.</NOTE> <HI>in as much as

I have known some men, and even women, who have thought the ground scarce worthy to receive the pressure of their feet, divested of all the ties and tenderness of humanity, and wholly puft up with <HI>vanity and lies;</HI> but as the reign of such is short, and not even then with∣out its pains, and <HI>their end miserable,</HI> as in many parts of the sacred records we are assured; may there be none such here present; on the contrary, let it be a part of your constant care, not only to feel the distresses of others, but to visit, and be convinced, and in a manner <HI>share</HI> the necessities of the poor and needy; to soften the anguish of their afflicted minds, to alleviate their hidden griefs, and to dry up the eyes of those that weep; and the tears which stream, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iv. 8, 9, 10.</NOTE> <HI>as faithful stewards of the manifold Grace of God; having fervent charity; knowing that charity shall cover a multitude of sins.

<P>Some that are present, may think this unreasonable doctrine, and be ready to reply, <Q>I have a family to provide for, and therefore I must embrace every op∣portunity of acquiring, and laying up all my acquisiti∣ons in store for them: and should I neglect the pre∣sent, the like may never happen again in the course of my life.</Q></P>
<P>Such or the like arguments are often too readily ta∣ken up, and obstinately urged, in opposition to the most important concern; to the unspeakable prejudice of themselves, of the dispositions and morals of their chil∣dren in particular, and of human society in general: how quick is the transition of many from a state of health
<PB N="65" REF="016777_0063_0F9E2F1FA4248870"/>to the grave!<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 20.</NOTE> <HI>"Thou fool! this night shall thy soul be required of thee!"</HI> was formerly pronounced to one of this kind by the great judge of all men. Consider then, it may be thy case; and art thou prepared against thy dying hour, to render him such an account, as will then support thee, and justify thee in thy claim to the inheritance of his everlasting kingdom, by thy having faithfully sought it, and attended to the conditions there∣of, preferably to all the dearest objects of this uncertain, and momentary state of existence?</P>
<P>I am fully of opinion, many who run after the world with open mouth, and that mouth scarce ever closed, 'till death closes it; could they be induced to yield some of their precious moments to timely and serious reflec∣tion; would endeavour to withdraw themselves from transitory things, at least before their last moments of life; and in some measure, prepare (after this manner) to meet their GOD.</P>
<P>They would now and then retire, for a short space at least, from the world, before they entirely left it; fre∣quently sit down, and seriously turn their view towards another world, another state of being, into which they can never hope to carry wealth, or honours; toward that approaching dread tribunal of righteousness, where these will gain no favour.</P>
<P>When we take a survey of the world, and look back thro' the generations that are past, we see that the love of vanity, wealth, and grandeur, hath proved from time to time the <HI>ruin</HI> even of the fairest <HI>empires</HI> and <HI>monar∣chies,</HI> which have been ever erected on the face of the earth: <HI>one reformation</HI> after another, and <HI>one state</HI> af∣ter another, have been destroyed, from the <HI>pride and dissipation</HI> inherent in the minds of <HI>governors</HI> and <HI>teachers.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="016777_0064_0F9E2F204AE57590"/>
How ought this consideration to humble the hearts, and redouble the vigilance of such as are placed in <HI>exalted stations!</HI></P>
<P>I hope and trust our love, as a people in general, hath not been confined peculiarly to ourselves; but ex∣tended, as it ought to be, to all our fellow creatures; to relieve poverty and distress, according to our abili∣ties; to prevent and reclaim from the infinite danger and harms of impiety, and to encourage every kind of real virtue.</P>
<P>Though some families may have turned aside into the state of the world, and become engrossed with the love of its pleasures and enjoyments; yet many others, I hope, and believe, have denied themselves; have <HI>laid hold of the good word of life;</HI> and under its influence, pursued <HI>the one thing needful.</HI> Tho' some have decli∣ned, and even refused, the subjection due to their ma∣ker, as if they had asked with insolence, <Q>Who is this LORD, that he should reign over our hearts?</Q> and had added, <Q>We know no power equal to that of get∣ting wealth, and honours;</Q>—yet others have not de∣parted from the obligations of fear and love; but have made proper reflections, paid just respect to the great author of their being; and manifested it by a steady watchfulness in conduct, which I most earnestly desire, may become the happy case of every one of my fellow creatures.</P>
<P>The present solemn occasion is an important lesson of instruction to us all! The departure of the disembodied soul, from this world, to another; which methinks should entirely prevent our setting too great a value upon all temporal possessions.</P>
<P>I have sometimes been present in a dying hour; I have been present at a scene of humbling distress; I
<PB N="67" REF="016777_0065_0F9E2F2382CC6E40"/>have seen in some, the closing period of a regular life of virtue: yet such a life, as on account of outward pover∣ty, had been despised and over looked—a whole life spent, in which its happiest moments would have past for miserable, in the minds of thousands: yet when they have finished their course, they have experienced triumphant joy, in the blessed hope and assurance of eternal life! through the merits of their <HI>dear redeemer.</HI></P>
<P>I have also beheld, on the other hand, the habitations of splendor exhibit a mournful scene of distress, far different from the former! Then, when the solemn ap∣proach of death hath begun to appear, attended with all its tremblings and fearful apprehensions of an after state! when the soul, agonizing in its pains, hath viewed things in a far different light to what it had before done, when even the riches, in which it had long trusted, fell short of giving the least satisfaction: no hope of future happiness afforded to the possessor! but, on the contra∣ry, a gloomy prospect of despair; of an eternal state of misery! of this have I been made a sorrowful witness, that some have gone out of the world,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 12.</NOTE> <HI>without God; without hope;</HI> without one comfortable reflection from the sacred ransom of a <HI>dying saviour!</HI></P>
<P>In vain have they ardently wished, in an expiring hour, that they might have been permitted to lengthen out their allotment of life, a little longer; that they might have but a short space of added time afforded them, for the important purpose of repentance, and amendment of life; for <HI>feeding the hungry, cloathing the naked,</HI> and <HI>visiting the sick;</HI> virtues, to which they had no pretence, in any of their past hours, and which then it proved too late for them to attain, however ne∣cessary, for their standing approved at the just judgment, to which they were approaching.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="016777_0066_0F9E2F246A7A4C50"/>
May we all therefore learn instruction, from exam∣ples like these; and derive such advantage from this present solemnity; seeking and embracing <HI>the good word of life;</HI> and ever stedfastly adhering to it, so long as we continue in mutability.</P>
<P>May we never withdraw ourselves, from watchful at∣tention, to the guidance of divine providence; never indulge ourselves in arrogance, or trust too much to the rectitude of our own hearts; but<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Thess. v. 17.</NOTE> <HI>pray without ceas∣ing,</HI> that we may be enabled to<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mat. iii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>do works meet for repentance;</HI> and thereby attain an eternal inheritance in the kingdom of GOD!</P>
<P>Once more suffer me to entreat you, my friends, in great good will, often seriously to reflect upon the im∣portance of the petition which I have thus far endeavour∣ed to enforce—<Q>Two things have I required of thee, O Lord! deny me them not before I die.</Q> As I am fully satisfied it is not and will not be sufficient for me, though I should stand ever so eminently high, on the account of riches, or honours, in the esteem or applause of men; <Q><HI>Remove, therefore, far from me vanity and lies; giving me neither poverty nor riches; but feed me,</HI> I pray thee, <HI>with food convenient for me, lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Ever beware of the first admission of evil.

Do thou, we pray Thee, animate and preserve thy ministers, elders, and heads of families; may they<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 13.</NOTE> <HI>be sober, and hope to the end;</HI> discharging their duties to Thee, themselves, their housholds, and the public; having on<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 14, 15, 16, 17.</NOTE> <HI>the helmet of salvation, the breast-plate of righteousness, the shield of faith, and sword of the spirit; and having their feet shod, with the preparation of the gospel of peace.</HI></P>
<P>Speak peace, we beseech Thee, O sovereign author of peace! to all that<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. xi. 28.</NOTE> <HI>are labouring and heavy laden;</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Isai. liv. 11.</NOTE> <HI>tossed and not comforted;</HI> still the perturbations of their minds, when arising and swelling, like the raging waves of the sea;<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Jer. v. 22.</NOTE> <HI>though the waves toss and roar, let them not prevail and pass over them.</HI></P>
<P>Now to Thee, whose goodness, mercy, and marvel∣lous power, the tongues and thoughts of the most grate∣ful and perfect of thy creatures here below, have ever fallen short of expressing or conceiving; to Thee, with the immaculate lamb, the son of thy bosom, be deser∣vedly and justly ascribed, as is most due, all honour and glory, through the succeeding pilgrimage of our lives; and when we shall no longer remain sojourners here up∣on earth, may we be admitted to continue the inexhau∣stible theme, in the boundless habitations of thy ever∣lasting glory, world without end.</P>

<HEAD>The following SERMON was preached at the Quarterly Meeting at French-Hay, near Bristol, May 26, 1767, in the morning.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cant. iv. 12.</NOTE> A garden inclosed is my sister, my Spouse, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</HEAD>
<P>THE whole Book of Canticles is understood and taken in the way of similitude, or metaphor, set∣ting forth that close connection, that near and dear re∣lation, which eternally subsists between CHRIST and his church; and in this sense it certainly conveys instruc∣tion, very profitable, as well as very delightful, to that mind which hath dedicated itself to the love and obedi∣ence of him, its only rightful LORD.</P>
<P><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">iv. 15.</NOTE> <HI>The Church</HI> is <HI>called a fountain of Gardens;</HI> which seems to me very evidently to imply that inclosed col∣lected strength, beauty, regularity; those consolatory refreshments; that steady firmness of thought, unity of heart, and divine affection, which becomes a people that well understand what is meant by the solemn in∣junction of<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. i. 13.</NOTE> <HI>girding up the loins of their minds:</HI> well apprized of the <HI>state of their pilgrimage;</HI> of the <HI>nature, end and design of their being;</HI> of the necessity of<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iv. 7.</NOTE> <HI>watchfulness unto prayer;</HI> of having their minds brought into, and established in, the lovely order of the gospel; <HI>their loins girded;</HI> their <HI>faculties circumscribed,</HI> and directed to the proper purpose, the great and glorious end of their being; within the limits of that holy frame of mind, which hath<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Prov. i. 7, and ix. 10.</NOTE> <HI>a fountain of gifts,</HI> preparatory to every kind of useful service, for the com∣fort
<PB N="75" REF="016777_0073_0F9E2F2C87EA8510"/>of individuals, and the united benefit of the whole body; ever abiding in the<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. i. 7.</NOTE> <HI>fear of the Lord,</HI> which is <HI>the beginning of wisdom:</HI> the most perfect wisdom, by which the mind is kept clean, and preserved in its pro∣per cloathing.</P>
<P>For <HI>the Fear of the Lord,</HI> as the Psalmist expresses it,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psal. xix. 9.</NOTE> <HI>is clean, and endureth for ever:</HI> and if this fear continues to rest upon our minds, it will assuredly keep them clean; and more and more illuminate them to discern the propriety and fitness of this language of CHRIST to his church: <HI>A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse, my church;</HI> erected and preserved by <HI>my power, my followers</HI> united to me, and all dear to one another,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. ii. 9</NOTE> <Q>a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</Q></P>
<P>May we therefore all separately, each for ourselves, attend to this state, and become acquainted with that degree of resemblance of such an inclosed garden which we beat, in the sight of him, who at one view, sees the several conditions of men, and beholds the state of his whole creation!</P>
<P>If we are inclosed, of what nature is our inclosure? since nothing less will become our sufficient defence, than the surrounding arm of the Almighty! He is the strength of every individual that rightly trusts in him: Their situation is aptly described in <HI>holy writ,</HI> in many parts of it, by a variety of lively and beautiful figures; as here, by that of <HI>a garden inclosed,</HI> or<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Cant. iv. 15.</NOTE> <HI>fountain of gardens.</HI> They likewise joyfully experience, in this sense of the text, what was meant by the song that was predicted to be sung in the land of <HI>Judah,</HI> when the divine covenant should happily cement, and inclose that favoured people in a state of innocence, integrity and love, enjoying together the lasting and unutterable
<PB N="76" REF="016777_0074_0F9E2F2D66483B60"/>sweets of divine protection and peace.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xxvi. 1.</NOTE> <HI>In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; we have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks:</HI> and I cannot but entreat that all pre∣sent, who are come to years of mature consideration, especially, may obey the call of GOD; come out of a state of sin, and neglect of duty, and become<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph ii. 19.</NOTE> <HI>fellow-citizens with the saints</HI> of this city; a city that hath<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 10.</NOTE> <HI>sure foundations;</HI> being built upon <HI>that rock,</HI> which<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Mat. xvi. 18.</NOTE> <HI>the gates of hell</HI> have never been able to <HI>prevail against.</HI></P>
<P>O you that are in the bloom of life, and surrounded with the impetuous waves of divers passions; who con∣tinue yet uncorrected, unrefined by divine grace; may you diligently and seriously reflect upon your extream want of resemblance to <HI>the garden inclosed;</HI> and of answering thereby the gracious design of your maker concerning you! May you be directed<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xix. 12.</NOTE> <HI>by the still small voice,</HI> which the LORD GOD will make use of, and meet you with<NOTE N="¶" PLACE="foot">Gen. iii. 8.</NOTE> <HI>in the garden;</HI> in order to reclaim you, and to draw you to himself! May all that stand in slippery places, make him their refuge, that they may know him, to calm every tumult in the mind; to crown <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with the joys of obedience; and to direct their steps aright thro' life, to his honour, and their own true and lasting happiness!</P>
<P>May all who mourn for want of a place of rest, at∣tain this happy situation, all who are ready to cry out as one formerly did,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxx. 5.</NOTE> <HI>"Woe is me that I sojourn in Meshech, and dwell in the tents of Kedar."</HI> Woe is me for this state of wickedness, with which I am now on every side surrounded; both that of my own, and that of others round about me! who are ready to fear
<PB N="77" REF="016777_0075_0F9E2F2F3608FA30"/><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jer. viii. 20.</NOTE> <HI>the harvest is past, the summer is ended, and that they are not gathered</HI> into the <HI>city walled with salvation;</HI> or the <HI>garden inclosed</HI> with divine beauty, with united and unfading joy!</P>
<P>I hope better things for those whose concern some∣times appears likely to become more than they are able to bear, even a concern, lest they should be excluded from an inheritance with the sanctified.</P>
<P>He that of old made<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm cxiv. 4.</NOTE> <HI>the mountains skip like rams, and the little hills like lambs,</HI> for the miraculous pre∣servation of his people, even when they had begun to despair of their deliverance; can still equally effect the like glorious work in restoring the desponding, the bro∣ken in heart; that, having been too much off their watch, have from thence been the more subject to be<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 14.</NOTE> <HI>tost about by every wind of doctrine,</HI> and cunning craftiness of men; whereby they lie in wait to deceive. Know that though your own resolutions, your own strength, and wisdom, have been insufficient (in the days that are past) for your security; and perhaps the strongest resolutions, that you have hitherto made, have been written in dust; so that the next gale of temptation hath blown them away; and you have hence been car∣ried further and further, into a state of groaning cap∣tivity, and crying distress! and have been unable to lift up your heads in the day of trial: know, that the duly humble and repenting sinner hath ever been graci∣ously received; and the diffident have become cloathed with divine strength, through the name and power of the LORD JESUS; their minds have been brought into a holy frame, having entered within the celestial inclo∣sure and defence.</P>
<P><HI>O that the salvation of Israel would come out of Sion, then should Jacob rejoice, and Israel should be
<PB N="78" REF="016777_0076_0F9E2F2F5277A940"/>right glad.</HI> This hath been the sacred language of individuals that have at times been tost in uncertainty, distressed in vanity, wickedness and disappointment; who, notwithstanding, have been at last happily fixed within the habitation of <HI>the holy city,</HI> or <HI>garden inclosed;</HI> through a steady perseverance and strong resistance, though in the night season; like Jacob, who as a prince,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xxxii. 28.</NOTE> <HI>prevailed with God and with men.</HI> So the sincere, the penitent sinner, in his resolute and patient conflict, imploring and relying on divine help, will at length ob∣tain an assured victory, to his great joy, and returning of thanksgiving to the author of all his mercies.</P>
<P><HI>A Garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse;</HI> ah, too unthinking youth! how widely different from this state is too many of yours! To you appears particularly ap∣plicable that antient call from GOD,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isa. xli. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Keep silence before me, oh ye islands!</HI> I beseech you, in this your time of danger, when your minds may be compared to floating islands, blown upon and covered with a successi∣on of waves, surrounded with temptations of various kinds, that are perpetually withdrawing you from that most precious interest, which CHRIST hath purchased for you in <HI>the garden inclosed;</HI> I beseech you, that you maintain a steady dependance upon him; that ye be vigilant in your pursuit after eternal enjoyments; that ye stand upon your guard against the wiles of the grand enemy to your salvation; remembring that even<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Job i. 6.</NOTE> <HI>when the sons of God have met together, Satan hath presented himself amongst them.</HI></P>
<P>Doth thy mind watch with holy diligence to prayer? being fervent in spirit, that though the enemy may endeavour to come in as a flood of corruption, and seek incessantly to draw thee from the strong hold of that city,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Isa. lx. 18.</NOTE> <HI>whose walls are salvation, and whose gates are praise;</HI> the arm of omnipotence may defend thee:
<PB N="79" REF="016777_0077_0F9E2F3016EE3D40"/>know, thou art no farther guilty than as thou joinest with the temptation; it is no sin to be tempted; the holy everlasting bridegroom of the true church, was himself tried, proved, tempted before thee, time after time, by <HI>the ruler of the darkness of this world, the prince of the power of the air;</HI> yet he continued unmoved, un∣wearied; being supported and sustained by the power of GOD:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. iv. 15.</NOTE> <HI>He was like unto us in all things, sin only excepted;</HI> he knows and is willing to sustain them that are tempted; and to encourage in the day of battle, every one that cleaveth unto, and calletih upon him, with full purpose of heart, in the whole course and con∣duct of his life: though he may be deeply proved, and may sometimes be ready to cry out, <Q>Even though the gates of death, may appear to be in motion against me, and just opening to receive me, yet if I die, Oh let it be at thy feet.</Q></P>
<P>This hath been the language of minds, in the day of temptation; and when the battle hath been hot, they have known a secret hiding place, where the enemy could not prevail. Though he encountered the whole army of martyrs; though they were tempted, trod upon, buffeted and even crucified; yet it was never in his pow∣er to subdue them; they were still succoured by the hand of the almighty; they were enabled to<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 12.</NOTE> <HI>fight the good fight of faith;</HI> to pass through all their <HI>fiery trials</HI> with patience; and, in honour of their victory, are now <HI>crowned with glory!</HI></P>
<P>How beautiful, how amiable, must be <HI>those gardens inclosed,</HI> the rising youth, in the vigour and prime of life! when their minds are circumscribed, and animated to piety; when they have upon them the indubitable proofs of the handy work of GOD; standing immoveably upright on the side of religion and virtue; keeping out all the works of darkness, by walls of divine erection!</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="016777_0078_0F9E2F31110F8DC0"/>
How excellent are these gardens inclosed! their con∣versation and behaviour, how edifying! how exemplary! how truly honourable! their admission is <HI>sure</HI> into<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. V. 1.</NOTE> <HI>that glorious house, not made with hands,</HI> to a perpetual festival, an eternal fruition of the unspeakably rich rewards of their good works, which they have been ena∣bled to perform, to the glorifying of their father who is in heaven.</P>
<P>Than such a blessed society as this I know of nothing that can possibly be deemed more amiable upon the face of the earth; nothing more consistent with the de∣sign <HI>of heaven;</HI> or more resembling <HI>its own</HI> happiness, for those that are young<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eccles. xii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>to remember their creator in the days of their youth,</HI> with a continual reverence; and to give up their hearts to him, in the perfection of love; for the most desirable part of the whole creation to live thus, amidst the bloom and lustre of the spring time of life, is to constitute the <HI>beauty of holiness!</HI> the one great ornament of <HI>the garden of the</HI> LORD here on earth!</P>
<P>Ye heads of families; fathers, mothers, and guardi∣ans, that preside over and sustain the various relations in domestic life; ever carefully prosecute your own eternal happiness, and the happiness of all those over whom you are placed in charge! exhorting them in ten∣der affection, and encouraging them by worthy example, to<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Col. iii, 2.</NOTE> <HI>set their affections on things above;</HI> watchfully guarding, and even confining them, in order to preserve them from all harms and corruptions of vice, <HI>as gardens inclosed</HI> within the limits of that holy fear,<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Prov. xiii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>which is a fountain of life, that preserves from the snares of death,</HI> and prepares for a crown of glory, in the regions of eternal felicity!</P>
<P>When the ties of nature become joined with ties of grace, and together rest upon the minds of parents
<PB N="81" REF="016777_0079_0F9E2F31B7E69BA0"/>and guardians; they cannot but be solicitous that their offspring and charge may be favoured in an eminent degree with divine preservation: they would then ear∣nestly desire to help them forward in their way, being qualified to say to the rising generation, <Q>Follow me as I follow CHRIST.</Q> I am persuaded had this been more generally the case, had they themselves, I say, really lived <HI>as gardens inclosed</HI> within the bounds of divine wisdom and government, our christian society would have worn a different aspect to what it now does. Could parents and heads of families, from time to time, have appealed to the searcher of hearts for the upright∣ness of their intentions, and the rectitude of their con∣duct in these most important concerns, then might they have said with holy confidence,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 29, 30.</NOTE> <HI>Lord! now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace; for mine eyes have seen thy salvation!</HI></P>
<P>What think ye parents? ye that live as it were in a state of stupefaction; what think ye of the important moment, when in the sight of GOD, angels, and men, inquisition for blood shall be made; what think ye of the preparation of rendering that account with joy, at the dread tribunal of final judgment? in which an en∣quiry into the discharge of your several duties, in this respect, will most assuredly be made!—It is possible, and indeed I cannot but believe it consistent with the goodness of the supreme being; that, where the natural parents have been negligent in their discharge of this important trust, and have conducted their offspring into byways and crooked paths, forgetful of the way that leadeth to life eternal; the everlasting father hath not been wholly unmindful of his children, thus abandoned to the wiles of the destroyer; but hath frequently reach∣ed forth a kind hand to such, and will continue to make up to them, who gratefully receive his kindness, and obey his voice, the deficiency of such past parental care;
<PB N="82" REF="016777_0080_0F9E2F324F59CF40"/>even by the virtue of his living power in their hearts: in the mean time, the very criminal neglect of such pa∣rents will, notwithstanding this, draw down on them its own weight of condemnation:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan. v. 5.27.</NOTE> <HI>the hand writing on the wall</HI> will still remain against them; and, like wicked <HI>Belshazzar,</HI> they will be <HI>weighed in the balance, and found wanting.</HI></P>
<P>Indeed it must be confest, and I am thoroughly assu∣red, that all parents are not thus negligent: I cannot but remember the inestimable father I had in early life; and above all things, his almost <HI>unexampled care and tenderness over his infant offspring.</HI> I well remember the <HI>very</HI> powerful and moving eloquence of descending tears! when he collected his numerous family of little ones about him, and in the time of our extream tender∣ness, and very early years, how often he hath wept over us, when he hath been recommending us to the throne of grace! though I cannot repeat the immediate lan∣guage he uttered, upon these occasions, which were so extreamly interesting to us all!</P>
<P>I wandered, as to myself indeed I may say, and strayed from the <HI>garden inclosed,</HI> in many of the suc∣ceeding steps of my life: and even now stand <HI>as a mo∣nument of mercy amongst you!</HI> whilst I thus afresh re∣member and recite this amazing instance of a tender parent's anxious and unabated care, for our preservation out of the evils that abound in the world; for our hav∣ing a safe place within the inclosures, where<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cant. i. 7.</NOTE> <HI>Christ feedeth his flock, and maketh them to rest at noon!</HI></P>
<P>O Fathers and mothers! I beseech you, by the mer∣cies of GOD, and the solemn account you must one day close with him; that you lay this charge seriously to heart; still offering up your humble petitions to the <HI>Father of light,</HI> that he will enable you, more and more,
<PB N="83" REF="016777_0081_0F9E2F33234B81D8"/>to instruct the children he hath blessed you with, in <HI>the one thing needful;</HI> in order that being thus savoured, thus enlightened and enlarged by his power, you may have nothing to do but die, when that time shall arrive; nothing to charge yourselves with, in relation to the neglect of this great duty, when the measure of your days shall be accomplished; but may render up your ac∣counts <HI>with joy,</HI> and receive the beatific sentence of<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxv. 21.</NOTE> <HI>Well done, good and faithful servant; thou hast been faithful in a little; I will make thee ruler over more; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>A Garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse.</HI>—May we pay all due honour to the testimony of CHRIST respect∣ing his church, both as individuals, as heads of families, and parents of children: and more and more sustain with diligence and propriety in all our several stations the character of gardens inclosed, or be <HI>as plants there∣in,</HI> of the <HI>Lord's own right hand planting;</HI> plentifully adorned and enriched with all the good fruits of his own spirit; that we may be, as our fathers were in the day, when the LORD rais'd them up, fed, and miraculously supported them! and may fervently pray,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isai. lii. 1, 2. lx. 1.</NOTE> <HI>that Zion might arise, and shine, and shake herself from the dust of the earth; and put on her beautiful garments!</HI> and that many amongst us, who yet need it, might shake themselves from those outward things that adorn them, as <HI>they</HI> vainly imagine; that <HI>that divine beauty and lustre</HI> which once conspicuously shined upon and adorned <HI>our Zion,</HI> may again be restored, and continue to dwell amongst us: and in order to this, may we study more and more the increase of righteousness and true holiness, encouraging one another by good example and by ten∣der counsel in the pursuit thereof; as we cannot, con∣sistent with our love of GOD, be indifferent in our wishes for the happiness and welfare of any of our fel∣low creatures; nor say of our brother, <Q>Let him alone,
<PB N="84" REF="016777_0082_0F9E2F35D9031768"/>Leave him to himself, it is sufficient for me to mind myself.</Q> Since it is our immediate duty to watch over him; and to be ready, on every occasion, tenderly to advise and assist, to prevent or support him; and not answer the LORD, when he shall require an account of his welfare from me;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iv. 9.</NOTE> <HI>Am I my brother's keeper?</HI></P>
<P>At this door, my friends, unspeakable damage hath entered, and widely spread amongst us as a people; even through this neglect, the grand deceiver hath the more easily broke into this and the other family; the power of seduction hath taken place; and many young people may be said to have laid violent hands on their own souls, and those of others too, in their gradual stepping out of the <HI>garden inclosed.</HI></P>
<P><Q><HI>Am I my brother's keeper?</HI> What have I to do with the welfare of another?</Q> This hath greatly ob∣structed the increase of our felicity, as a collective body; the progress of our Zion; and introduced the destroyer; who hath broke into our inclosure, and made a sorrow∣ful devastation among the flock and family of GOD. Where I see thus the danger of the hedge <HI>(which the Lord in mercy made about us!)</HI> being broke down; I cannot help expressing my concern, and using my spee∣dy and vigilant efforts to prevent, as much as possible, the beginning and increase of so great an evil.</P>
<P>Is there even a servant lad, or a servant girl that hath continued neglected, and their minds left to wander at will? I cannot but feel for them, with an earnest desire of informing such, and drawing them, if possible, with∣in the limits of the garden inclosed; that they might enjoy the benefit and delightful assurance of immortal happiness, from their entrance into, and continuance in well doing! Many fly from their own interest, forget
<PB N="85" REF="016777_0083_0F9E2F36C6E4F038"/>the GOD that made them, and even<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 29.</NOTE> <HI>account the blood of the covenant as an unholy thing,</HI> for want of having their minds properly centered, and their judgments du∣ly enlightened; and therefore it is all your duty, who are advanced within the heavenly bounds, and are grown up into a capacity of service, so faithfully to improve your talents, that ye may become instrumental, to en∣lighten their understanding, and to administer to them a suitable degree of spiritual health: not to say, <HI>Am I my brother's keeper?</HI> but <HI>if ye love God, to love your brother also;</HI> to lead him within the heritage and limits of the inclosed garden; within the <HI>impregnable defence of that city whose walls are salvation.</HI></P>
<P>I know well, friends, that tho' my education was within the garden inclosed, yet I wandered far from it; and in my departing, laid myself open to the enemy of my soul. I kept the worst of company; I subjected my∣self to almost every temptation; broke through the fence of the sacred inclosure! trampled it under my feet! and when for a time I found the least inclination to do good, evil was present with me! and I went on from one de∣gree of it to another! my wickedness so far increased with my diligence that at length, alas! I beheld the strong wall broken down! the garden wall destroyed! the mound left defenceless! and no hopes left of returning peace to my afflicted soul!</P>
<P>O ye, who are the hopes of the next generation! the steps I have trod warrant me to expostulate with, and to warn you of the most dreadful danger of that devi∣ation, to which youth is too prone, for want of due and timely reflection, suitable to its vast importance; and the extream difficulty of treading back, or extricating yourselves from it, when the mind is once engaged and entered into the path of folly: believe me, now is your
<PB N="86" REF="016777_0084_0F9E2F36D2F491D0"/>acceptable time; now is the day of the LORD's tender mercy afforded to you: flatter not yourselves therefore with the hope of its being time enough, that in some future part of your lives you will diligently seek him: now is your seed time; your hour of profitable diligence; and not in the decline of life. Life frequently is held by a moment of time! it passes, and man is no more seen!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. xl. 6.</NOTE> <HI>All flesh is grass, and its beauty as the flower of the field; the grass withereth, and the flower fadeth.</HI> The grave, to which we are all hastening, ought to be an early lesson of serious instruction, sounding the alarm in the ears of every youth; seeing it is frequently open∣ed to receive its victims in the very bloom of life; and<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eccles. xii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>before the years draw nigh,</HI> in which, in the course of nature, <HI>they can take no pleasure</HI>—<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxvii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>boast not</HI> therefore <HI>thyself of to-morrow,</HI> since <HI>thou knowest not what a day may bring forth;</HI> but rather let the example of others teach thee, the absolute necessity of improving the pre∣sent moments; and duly to reflect upon the imminent danger of delay.</P>
<P>If thy delight be not now within the <HI>garden inclosed,</HI> thou canst not reasonably expect hereafter to do<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Acts xxvi. 20.</NOTE> <HI>works meet for repentance:</HI> believe me, the evening hour will have its fill of work, even after discharging the duty of the most diligent day; though thou begin this necessary work immediately, thou wilt not have a moment to spare when thy sands of life are hastening to a close, and thou art finally appointed to tread the silent and solemn path of death! which is an hour that will, doubtless, bring with it a sufficient employment to the most serious mind, and to the most assiduous improver of the time that hath been allotted him in mutability.</P>
<P>O then, ye beloved youth! that your minds may be thus properly exercised to lay hold on the things that
<PB N="87" REF="016777_0085_0F9E2F38097AB260"/>belong to your everlasting peace! may you lay these re∣flections seriously to heart; and may their good effects demonstrate that they have a powerful and proper influ∣ence upon your conduct, through the whole series of your lives; that ye may finish your course with joy! and be crowned in the end with glory and immortality! hav∣ing faithfully answered the boundless love of CHRIST to his church, whose peculiar relation to himself he express∣eth in this endearing language, <HI>A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse, a spring shut up, a fountain sealed.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The following <HI>PRAYER</HI> likewise was delivered extempore, after the preceding Discourse, by the same eminent speaker.</HEAD>
<P>WE approach thy presence, O Father of infinite kindness, and make mention of thy name, in a deep and awful sense of thy mercy, which hath followed us from time to time, and most graciously encouraged us, even to open our hearts before thee! the LORD of heaven, and the whole earth!</P>
<P>We were <HI>cast upon rocks,</HI> and there left in a destitute and perishing state; when thou manifested thy tender regard, stretched forth thy delivering hand, and fed and sustained us by thy watchful providence! Thou wast pleased to look upon us in mercy, in the days of our temporal calamities! to reveal to us the saving arm of thy power, and to cause those very calamities to turn to our solid advantage! Thou, who art encircled with light, didst enlighten our darkness; gave us clearly to under∣stand the great things of thy law; such of them as thou in thy wisdom saw necessary for us. In the day of our utmost need, thou wast pleased to appear for us, and to speak <HI>comfort</HI> to our afflicted states!</P>
<P>We earnestly beg, that the grateful sense of all these thine unutterably kind dealings with us, may be imprint∣ed on our hearts in <HI>characters never</HI> to be <HI>obliterated!</HI> What more have we to ask, but that thou may ever con∣tinue to guide and direct us! that such a sense of thy unmerited mercies may be to us, as often heretofore it hath been, an enlivening comfort, and a strong support in the day of trouble: and we beseech thee, O blessed father! to remember all in the like situation: send forth <HI>thy light and thy truth</HI> even amongst those who have never known, or have long forgotten thee. We pray
<PB N="89" REF="016777_0087_0F9E2F391021C6A8"/>thee, draw them into thy holy house; plant them in thine inclosed, for ever beautiful and most excellent garden! their hearts becoming hereby powerfully in∣clined to attend with a fixed and unlimited submission, to the salutary discipline of thine omnipresent, and un∣erring wisdom!</P>
<P>If thou see any cast upon the bed of languishing, do thou be pleased, we humbly pray thee, to afford them the visitation of thy love: let thy divine consolation be their continual attendant, whereby they may be endued with perfect resignation to thy blessed will!</P>
<P>O thou! that hast poured into our hearts, the fresh and reviving sense of thy unbounded love; accept we beseech thee, our prayers for our own preservation, and the lifting up of our hands for one another, for the gathering together of many to thy self; who art, and hast been, the restorer of many that have been <HI>scattered abroad,</HI> that have <HI>gone astray,</HI> being seduced by vari∣ous temptations, from thy <HI>sacred truth.</HI></P>
<P>For thy great name's sake, for thy dear son's sake, and for the sake of thy glorious cause of righteousness! we pray thee, remember the offspring of thy people; incline and strengthen them more, and more, to turn towards thee; and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 1.</NOTE> <HI>to run the race that is set before them;</HI> that in the places of the honourable fathers, re∣moved to thy kingdom, may succeed their sons; stea∣dily walking in their footsteps, to the glory of thy name; that generation to generation may tell thy acts, and age to age pronounce thy goodness and marvellous power; who, through manifold <HI>temptations and trials,</HI> prefer∣vest <HI>unspotted from the world,</HI> them who trust in thee, and adhere to the dictates of thy grace!</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="016777_0088_0F9E2F39D223D068"/>
Be with the people assembled here at this time; and in a particular manner with those that are thine in heart, and dedicated to thy service. Endue, we pray thee, with the spirit of sound judgment, <HI>those that sit in judgment;</HI> and strengthen those who are enlisted into thine army, <HI>engaged under thy banner, and that turn the battle to the gate,</HI> that they may so act, and<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 12.</NOTE> <HI>so fight the good fight of faith,</HI> as to lay hold on eternal life! which thou art now, in this the day of thy mercy, freely offering unto all!</P>
<P>May the ministers and stewards of thy word, chear∣fully proceed in thy glorious cause, speaking powerfully in wisdom to all, that many may become through their calls, yet more and more ardently inclined to listen to the doctrine of thy son, and to be instructed in thy law immediately from his internal voice in their own hearts.</P>
<P>O holy and infinite father of all our mercies! grant we beseech thee, that being preserved in our stations, as those who are<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Coloss. iii. 1, 2, 4.</NOTE> <HI>risen with Christ, our affections may be set on things which are above,</HI> and our life hid with them in thee our GOD, that <HI>when he who is our life shall appear, we also may appear with him in glory!</HI></P>
<P>May all our faculties, and all that is within us, bless thy great and excellent name; may we perpetually ap∣proach thy throne with confidence, to offer thee the ob∣lation of humble prayer, and grateful praise and thanks∣giving, now, henceforth, and for ever, world without end! <HI>Amen.</HI></P>

<P>THE Editor of the following Sermon, which was delivered extempore to a large Auditory of different Persuasions, conceives himself obliged to acknowledge, that the Idea of printing it, was not successful enough to obtain the Preacher's <HI>Approbation.</HI> Nevertheless through the repeated Requests of many of the Hearers, who were of opinion it might be rendered more extensively useful if printed, provided a serious and impar∣tial Attention were paid to those important Truths which are the Subjects enlarged upon therein, he has been prevailed upon to submit it to the Can∣dour of the Public; being not without a Hope, that the apparent Benevolence of the Motive which first suggested the Design, will in some Measure excuse him to the Preacher for the Part he has taken in the Execution of it.</P>

<HEAD>A SERMON.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not in the "Oldness of the Letter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. vii, 6.</NOTE>," or in un∣feeling Formality, but from the animating warmth of Gospel Love, that I salute this assembly in these ex∣pressions; <HI>The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Love of God, and the Communion of the Holy Ghost, be with you all always. Amen.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xiii. 14.</NOTE> It is the constant language of that evangelical spirit, from which arises this tribute of <Q>Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, good-will to men<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Luke ii. 14.</NOTE>,</Q> and which I am thankful to feel not restrained within less compass than the Bulk of Mankind; but zealously and ardently pointing towards all such as profess faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and a hope of salvation by him.</P>
<P>There is something further couched in this affectionate salutation than the language of Love; the language of Wisdom.—That Wisdom which is "profitable to direct<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Eccl. x. 10.</NOTE>," seems to me very evidently and very eminently displayed by the father of mercy and kindness in these expressions; which, by divine assistance, I would endea∣vour a little to open, and to urge as words of some
<PB N="94" REF="016777_0092_0F9E2F3F659B5990"/>signification, unto all such whose minds are at times turned to contemplate, and not only contemplate, but also to pursue, "the things which make for peace<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 19.</NOTE>."</P>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD><HI>I.</HI> The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HEAD>
<P>There is no language, or form of words, sufficiently copious and expressive, though raised to the utmost ex∣tent or height of description, for representing the adora∣ble manifestations of heavenly kindness, goodness, con∣descension and mercy, or for exhibiting the things which proceed from the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ: but it is allowable to speak whereof we know, according to the Measure of knowledge, and to utter, according to the proportion of Strength given, what we now see in part, and what from experience we feel, of the merciful kindness of God; and which, as we faithfully follow his will, we shall hereafter more fully and comprehensively behold.—This I apprehend is necessary for all, to whom a revelation of the Christian Religion has been made by means of Holy Writ; and in an especial manner, where He that is the discoverer of states, has opened their un∣derstandings to believe the Doctrines of the Christian Religion, and the sacred records of that miraculous Fa∣vour and Grace that came by Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>But for my own part, I must freely acknowledge there was a time of my life, in which I would gladly have relieved myself from following the arduous paths of religion, by turning aside into the paths of Scep∣ticism and Infidelity. My mind was ready to alledge, as some at this time of day may be, <Q>How can we believe without Evidence! There is not a sufficient Evidence of Truth to convince my judgment, or to induce me to believe.</Q> I know this has been the allegation of some: But I have found there is no Defi∣ciency
<PB N="95" REF="016777_0093_0F9E2F4094CFF120"/>of evidence, but an unwillingness to admit the Force of that evidence, which would properly influ∣ence the mind; and I have reason to apprehend this has been the case with others; for if there was a tho∣rough submission, and disposition of mind to receive the Truth in the Love of it; to endeavour after it in its genuine simplicity; to look at it with a single eye; and, if I may be allowed the expression, to suppress or banish all the <HI>"buts</HI> and <HI>ifs;</HI> we should soon find the Evidence of the Christian Religion to be lively and in∣contestible, and effectually to operate to make us wise and good; Wise with the Wisdom that is to Salvation; and Good, with the Goodness that is of God, the Source of Goodness.</P>
<P>But whilst people "take counsel, and not of God," and suffer themselves to be <Q>covered with a covering and not of his Spirit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah xxx 1.</NOTE>,</Q> they are unwilling to admit the force of those truths which would <Q>separate the precious from the vile,</Q> and <Q>purify us according to his word.</Q>—While this is the case that many deviate in point of Faith, they may complain of the want of Evidence, respecting the Certainty and Truth of the Christian Religion; and complain with as much justice, as a man who wilfully hides himself in Darkness, com∣plains of his Incapacity of Seeing. For we have <HI>such</HI> an evidence and understanding imparted by the Light and Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, as doubtless abun∣dantly displays the immediate Regard and Love of God, as recorded in Holy Writ; and from which I freely acknowledge an internal illumination <HI>necessary,</HI> for all that would have valid claim to the Christian Religion; whereby we obtain a firm assurance of, and a well-grounded belief in, those glorious truths.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="016777_0094_0F9E2F4154DADA18"/>
We have sometimes been accused of allegorizing away the important truths of the Christian Religion as recorded in Holy Writ: It is far, very far, from our in∣tention or inclination! We want to <HI>inforce</HI> them, upon ourselves, upon our brethren, with all that requisite weight which commands their belief; calling to a belief of <HI>Heart,</HI> not a mere assent with the Tongue; but "a belief of Heart unto righteousness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom, x. 10.</NOTE>."</P>
<P>We have been distinguished, and are not ashamed of the distinction, for preaching, "Christ within;" but we never preach a Christ within, opposed to, or derogating from, a Christ <HI>without.</HI>—We fully believe not only in his glorious and gracious appearance amongst the sons of men, "as in the volume of the book it is written<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 7.</NOTE>;" but we also believe in his inward and spiritual appear∣ance, "the second time without sin unto salvation<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. ix. 28.</NOTE>;" in which we are supported by a cloud of witnesses<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xii. 1</NOTE>, and by the doctrine of the holy Author of the Christian Religion, inforcing his inward and spiritual manifestation (the manifestation of his Grace) in as clear and indubit∣able a manner, as from the testimonies delivered con∣cerning his external appearance.</P>
<P>But the mystery of ungodliness hath powerfully wrought with some who profess the Christian name, in opposition to the force of those testimonies with re∣gard to his internal appearance, or manifestation of him∣self in the hearts of mankind; and to render inadmissi∣ble the doctrine of an inward and spiritual communion, the revelation of Light, Life, and Good to the souls of men, immediately imparted for our redemption and sanctification.—This would lead people home from the flowery paths of Ease and Speculation, into the arduous one of Practice: It would transfer religion from the <HI>Head</HI> to the <HI>Heart;</HI> and, in its progress, would remove
<PB N="97" REF="016777_0095_0F9E2F4210707B18"/>every obctacle to the admission of the doctrine of an in∣ward and spiritual manifestation of the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>But there hath been a lamentable defection from the Life and Spirit of true christianity, wherein the Old Man, under all the pomp of Opinion, and assenting to indubitable Truths still remains in full possession of every inordinate love, and his goods are at ease. A mind disguised with JACOB'S Voice, and ESAU'S Hands, sound orthodox Principles, with a schismatic Heart, in∣gross the Formalist of all names and distinctions to reli∣gion; the old man being at ease with his goods, in a state of self-sufficiency, either rejoicing under a Form, and the false shade of Opinion and regularity of conduct, or in the pomp of a specious external appearance; wherein some continue possessed of an unhappy tranquil∣lity or ease of mind, and are endeavouring to build up a tabernacle quiet and safe, content with a Form, or depending upon a bare Belief in the doctrines of the christian religion.—But there is a work whereby the <HI>Old</HI> Earth, and the <HI>Old</HI> Heavens are made to <HI>shake,</HI> and must be removed; which is of the adorable mercy and grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, when he thus may reveal him∣self;—</P>
<P><Q>Yet once more will I shake not the Earth only, but also HEAVEN!<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 27.</NOTE></Q>—Not only the Earth, not only against the inhabitants of the earth; but the Work of God is made conspicuous in the Awakening of the ungodly, for their conversion from sin and death, unto righteousness and life.—"Yet once more will I shake HEAVEN!"—The glorious specious Appearances of Truth, and Doctrines recorded and assented to, but yet not reduced to Experience; truths received and con∣fessed by the Tongue, but the Heart revolting from their efficacious influence.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="016777_0096_0F9E2F43223AB5E8"/>
<Q>Yet once more will I shake not the Earth only, but also Heaven.</Q> And this word, yet once <HI>more,</HI> signifies the REMOVING of those things which are shak∣en. And undoubtedly the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, in its manifestation, procedure and effects, would shake <HI>every</HI> false rest in which any deluded soul may have fixed its repose: He would shake every false rest among those under all names and distinctions to religion, who are trusting in <HI>Name</HI> and in <HI>Form,</HI> without the POWER, or an experience of its virtual effects upon the soul; these all appertain to one family:—and not only so, but he would shake every false rest, yea and the FOUNDATION, of those who are building upon a <HI>Pro∣fession,</HI> and upon the Apostles <HI>Testimony</HI> of Jesus Christ; because they are only building upon the <HI>Credibility</HI> of those truths, yet cannot experimentally say, Through the Grace of our Lord Jesus, "We acknowledge the Truth, according to Godliness.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Titus i. 1.</NOTE>"</P>
<P>They that are of the World, come here also to a house fortified with <HI>Opinion,</HI> and are supporting them∣selves in having obtained a clear, full, and concise knowledge of the Truth of the Christian Religion. But there is a power that will search every <HI>false foundation,</HI> and overturn every superficial dependence on Human Production, that is inconsistent with the uniform tendency of his sacred Law, fashioned upon the plan of unchange∣able, everlasting Wisdom.—It is not of Man, or by Man, but proceeds from the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, whereby those truths are brought home to the Hearts of mankind. The gracious effects of his power∣ful working, are manifested to bring us home from a state of false dependence, that we may humbly and ex∣perimentally acknowledge, <Q>In God is my Salvation, and my Glory, the Rock of my Strength:<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. lxii. 7.</NOTE> in God alone is my Trust.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="99" REF="016777_0097_0F9E2F4629447FB8"/>
But "the Strong Man," armed with OPINION and BELIEF, has nevertheless been pursuing <HI>vitiated Affecti∣ons;</HI> which people have endeavoured to retain, and glossed over with a specious lofty Profession; fully assenting to the truths handed forth from the experience of others, but unreduced to practice in themselves.</P>
<P><Q>While the strong man armed keeps the palace, the things that he possesseth are in peace;<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xi. 21.</NOTE> until a stronger than he overcome, and cast him out with all his goods.</Q>—All those things that are inconsistent with the holiness and purity of the Divine Nature, which are pointed clearly out, and may be understood, by the declaration of our Lord concerning the Church, wherein <Q>every plant that is not of my heavenly Fa∣ther's right hand planting, shall be rooted out.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. xv. 13.</NOTE></Q>—What would then become of all those things, which a mistaken judgment calls "but <HI>little</HI> things?" Of the Pleasures and Amusements of the present age, invented by the sons of dissipation, who add wings to their mo∣ments, and are carried forward with rapidity through time, unprepared, to a final judgment? What a mul∣tiplicity of those things which are <Q>not of the Father, but of the World that lies in wickedness:<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 19.</NOTE></Q> things of which I shall not now particularly speak; but they are such as have no life in the LIFE of the Lord Jesus Christ in Man, but are ever Enemies to it, while the Affections are earthly, and confined to this world, how∣ever the partiality of deluded minds may think to seek a resource, and attempt to obviate the seeming Rigours of the Gospel, or find for themselves an easier and more flexible way, by resting upon a mere Belief of <HI>Systems</HI> (the goods belonging to the strong man armed) wherein they endeavour to support themselves, and are high in Profession, but weak respecting Practice? A species of Deviation from the Power of Truth proceeding from the
<PB N="100" REF="016777_0098_0F9E2F470CCC65D0"/>Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, which would search the secrets of every Heart! It would open to the view of the attentive mind their nature, and the situation they are in; what is of God, and what is not of God; what is pure, and what is impure: It would ever prove a more de∣cisive test in all our actions, a more certain criterion in our conduct through life, than it is to be feared the generali∣ty of Christian professors have attained, and which it is absolutely impossible for the Strong Man armed to pro∣duce, with all his seeming Sanctity of the Flesh, or strenuous Support of Belief, and a multitude of external performances; notwithstanding he may endeavour to plead for the "Law and the Commandment," and think thereby to attain the mark of Christ's followers, who "walk therein all the days of their lives."</P>
<P>But although they are thus lifted up in their minds, there is an Omniscient and Omnipresent BEING, who cannot be deceived or imposed upon; and it is impossible to invalidate that invariable obligation to live under the Power of the Cross of Christ, however they may en∣deavour to find means, by professing his Name without taking up a Cross to the inordinate pleasures and pur∣suits of this world, or attribute to themselves the merits of his death, without a death unto sin, and a new birth unto righteousness, wherein alone we are made partakers of an everlasting glory.</P>
<P>I beseech you by the most powerful motive of the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that every one may en∣deavour to cultivate in your minds a living Sense of Re∣ligion; and that we may all experience the purity and sanctity of its nature to operate in our hearts; and as members of one Family, tho' distinguished by various Names, we may continue as Brethren and Fellow-pil∣grims, in our passage through the wilderness of this world, to an endless Glory; that we may run with pa∣tience
<PB N="101" REF="016777_0099_0F9E2F4890BD33B8"/>the arduous race, although through distress of temptation and probation, to an inheritance incorrupti∣ble, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.</P>
<P>I beseech you by the Mercies of God, by every pow∣erful motive, in the language of Love, the Love of God, which lives in my heart, lay hold of the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; by which alone our hearts and minds can experimentally acknowledge, that it is by the virtue of it we are cleansed, purified, and redeemed from the pollutions and defilements of the world; and whereby we become fashioned in the image of righteous∣ness and true holiness.</P>
<P>Let us next consider the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ as offered for our REDEMPTION.—And I have no doubt of its being acknowledged, by all who have any understanding of the nature of True Christianity, or care about their immortal souls, that the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ manifestly leads to the doctrine of <Q>Repentance from dead works, and of Faith towards God;</Q> to a redemption of the soul from death, hell, and the grave; consequently, from that state of punish∣ment due to sinners, where the ungodly receive the re∣ward of their disobedience:—Neither have I any doubt of our being accompanied herein by a cloud of witnesses, who <HI>feel</HI> the Truth of the Christian Religion, and know the force and authority of those testimonies concerning it.—And let us take along with us the knowledge which the apostles and primitive believers had of the Christian Redemption and Doctrine in their times, that <Q>the Grace of God, that brings salvation, hath appeared to ALL men; teaching us, that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present world; looking for that blessed hope, and glorious appearance, of the Grace of God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who gave
<PB N="102" REF="016777_0100_0F9E2F48CF796918"/>himself for us, that he might redeem us from all ini∣quity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Titus ii. 11, 12, 13, 14.</NOTE>.</Q> This is the Redemption proposed by the Gospel, which commands our assent, and will remain obligatory throughout all ages of the Christian dispensation.</P>
<P>But there has been a claim to Redemption, introduc∣ed in the Apostacy from the LIFE of Religion, maintain∣ed amongst professors under various names, who plead the Impossibility of being redeemed from the Power of Sin;—a Redemption from the Penalty, but not from the Commission;—a Redemption from the Punishment with∣out a Victory over the transgressing nature:—And herein the mystery of unrighteousness hath powerfully wrought, and still works, thus to substitute Names for Things, Sounds instead of Substance; and a Profession instead of a lively Possession of its powerful and virtual effects upon the mind.—But it is a Redemption from <HI>"all iniquity,"</HI> whereby alone he will <Q>purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works,</Q></P>
<P><Q>Thou shalt call his name JESUS, for he shall save his people from their <HI>Sins</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mat. i. 21.</NOTE></Q>—From the Worldly Nature, and from the Corruptions and Defilements in the world.—A Redemption from the Power of Sin;—wherein we are sanctified, and justified, in the sight of God, and are prepared for an admission into the kingdom of heaven, as we are possessed of this efficaci∣ous redemption:—"It is like unto a little Leaven, which a <Q>woman took and hid in three measures of meal<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. xiii. 33.</NOTE></Q>—It was operative;—and being diffussed through the three measures of meal, there was a <HI>real, inherent</HI> Change, or partaking of its own <HI>Nature;</HI>—a change effected by the powerful diffusion of that leaven∣ing Virtue.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="016777_0101_0F9E2F498E19C1A8"/>
This is the Redemption of Jesus Christ;—a Redemp∣tion effected by the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.—It consists not in the Strength, or Change of <HI>Opinions,</HI> or a formal Conception;—but as we experience a gra∣dual progression from glory to glory, and from one de∣gree of similitude, or resemblance, of the Divine Image to another, until we attain a victory here, and the con∣summation of happiness in a future state.</P>
<P>I apprehend this is the genuine nature of Christian Redemption, as proposed by the Gospel, which will stand the test, and bring forth the glorious fruits of <Q><HI>RIGHTEOUSNESS, PEACE, and JOY</HI> in the HOLY GHOST;</Q> and wherein he will refine, and purify unto himself, a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</P>
<P>We are not to ascribe or attribute to ourselves any <HI>Merit</HI> of <HI>Works,</HI> as performed in the strength of a na∣tural Understanding, or from any religious Attainments; but ever to retain a consciousness of our inability; as knowing nothing belongs to us as Creatures, but "Blushing and Confusion of Face<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dan. ix. 7.</NOTE>;" and that our growth towards perfection proceeds from the assistance dispensed of his unbounded mercy and grace; as saith the apostle, <Q>It is by the Grace of God I am what I am; and his Grace which is in me, was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the Grace of God which is IN me<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 10.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>I have no doubt that many of your minds, under va∣rious names and distinctions to religion, have been at times touched with a feeling sense of the nature and ex∣cellency of true christianity; with a <HI>blessed</HI> sense of it, proceeding from the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ.—
<PB N="104" REF="016777_0102_0F9E2F4A4A9E3748"/>May you <HI>so</HI> follow on, as to experience a <HI>further</HI> pro∣gress in its efficacious operation upon your minds, and witness its Leavening Virtue into its own <HI>Nature,</HI> draw∣ing you from the temper and defilements of the world, by a transformation of your minds from dead works, to serve the living God!—wherein you would truly experi∣ence an increase in strength, derived from him to whom "all Power is given<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxviii. 18.</NOTE>:" power to effect every excellent purpose, and fill up to you all those relative attributes which are inseparable from the Divine Nature; and wherein he is mercifully communicating an holy evidence of Faith in the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; a faith in <Q>things not seen, the substance of things hoped for<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 1.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>May we be engaged in an humble dependence, and awful worship, before the God of heaven and earth! continually contemplate him in his adorable perfections, as the Father and Fountain of all our mercies; and faithfully regard every part of our duty in bringing "Glory to God," proposed as the Mark of Redempti∣on and Reconciliation, through the Merits and Mediati∣on of a crucified Saviour; <Q>who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works.</Q>—In this manner we become members of his sacred Militant Church on Earth; and are entering up∣on the path to the Triumphant Church in Heaven.</P>
<P>We were made a little lower than the angels, and in∣tended to partake in the fruition of happiness with the spirits of just men made perfect, in the general assembly of the first-born sons of God. And I have no doubt but he will still beautify his footstool by the gift of his Grace, the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, proceeding
<PB N="105" REF="016777_0103_0F9E2F4B2CA707C0"/>from himself, the Author and Fountain of good, and of every perfect work, whereunto we are called by his Spirit, and become united in membership with his sancti∣fied church and family:—So that having filled up the measure of our days in the world, we may finally receive the beatific reward of an endless life with the just of all generations.</P>
<P>I have no doubt of the possibility of <HI>Access</HI> to the Fa∣ther while cloathed with <HI>mortality,</HI> through the mediati∣on and intercession of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.—But it is as we admit his Spirit to operate in our minds to <HI>prepare</HI> us for access, and duly attend to the assistance afforded us.</P>
<P><Q>May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, always!</Q>—May you be built up in his Grace, and continue engaged in the contemplation of his ador∣able perfections! the infinite Kindness and Goodness of God! the excellency and purity of the Christian Nature! and, by a separation from the world, obtain a well-grounded hope <Q>that he may be with you all, always.

<P>Yet notwithstanding an happy advancement may be known, a state of humble Watchfulness is our duty, and our safety.—I cannot join with the opinion of those, who maintain the doctrine of <Q><HI>once</HI> in Grace, <HI>ever</HI> in Grace.</Q>—I believe that it is possible for those who have been visited with a measure and manifestation of the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that have <Q>tasted the good word of life, and of the powers of the world to come<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 5.</NOTE>,</Q> to <HI>fall away.</HI>—It is necessary to continue in a state of Daily Dependence on Divine Strength, for our faithful perseverance in the uniform

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ; the Love of God.</HEAD>
<P>He hath <HI>so</HI> loved us, and manifested his inconceiv∣able favour towards us, that he hath not dealt with us according to our <HI>Merits,</HI> but of his free and un∣merited GRACE, that we might become heirs of an endless inheritance in glory! <Q>God <HI>so</HI> loved the world, that he sent his own Son into the world to be a LIGHT to the world; a Light to enlighten the Gentiles, and to be his Salvation to the ends of the earth<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acts xiii. 47.</NOTE></Q>—It is this heavenly Love, the Love of God, that is the grand and solemn cement of his fa∣mily, both here and hereafter: wherein we are united to him, and in fellowship one with another. It binds all into an uniform consistency, both in heaven and earth.—Many <HI>other</HI> objects of our love are local and temporary, limited to Time and Place, or confined to this world, and to the things that are in it: but the Love of GOD is an <HI>endless</HI> commandment.—It is CHARITY; that divine Charity, that will remain when
<PB N="107" REF="016777_0105_0F9E2F4F0723BA70"/>testimonies shall cease, and declarations come to an end;—in a participation whereof we shall still continue to join in holy worship and adoration unto God, the Author of our being.</P>
<P>It is in the enjoyment of this divine and ardent Charity, that the celestial inhabitants in the realms of light receive the sacred Emanations of LOVE, and enjoy the Favour of God in a participation of those ineffable pleasures which it yields to the glorified as∣sembly of saints in bliss.—And, indeed, it seems to me to be the grand Source of all happiness and duty, hap∣piness in heaven, as well as perfection of wisdom to the sons of men, derived from those gracious relative attributes of the Divinity wherein he is mercifully communicating the essential part of his own Nature, being in Himself, "altogether <HI>lovely,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Canticles v. 16.</NOTE>" consummate in the perfection of holiness, and unparallelled in wis∣dom!—wherein we are sometimes favoured with the fruition of his Love, measurably imparted, to our com∣fort and unspeakable joy, infinitely superior to all that this world can afford, and which will remain, when <Q>the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Peter iii. 10.</NOTE></Q>—The Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the Love of God, will then open unto the foul that glori∣ous prospect of unutterable, inconceivable happiness, which is the provision of God for the righteous, and those who faithfully persevere to a peaceful and happy conclusion.</P>
<P>It is by virtue of the Grace and Love of God, that we are enabled to advance in a proper progression through the various steps of a religious life; and which would kindle an ardour of affection in the mind
<PB N="108" REF="016777_0106_0F9E2F508110A8C8"/>with desires for a continued supply of that heavenly virtue, which nourishes the soul up unto eternal life.—A Want of <HI>this,</HI> makes us bow to the god of this world, and to things that are in it.—The love of Mo∣ney, Riches, and the Praise of Men; which with va∣rious powers of seduction are presented to our view, and our prospects are bounded by the narrow concep∣tions of an Earthly Mind.—It is a love of those things, which obstructs the progress of religion.—A secret deviation from the Love of God to a Love of this World, has prevailed in many.—But how can it be otherwise, since like will ever assimilate with its like? And while the BODY is terrestrial, the GLORY is ter∣restrial, and the body will continue engaged in the pur∣suit of earthly things.—For every mind will attend to its Similitude.—And <HI>while</HI> the Body is terrestrial, the Glory will <HI>remain</HI> terrestrial, however it may assume a resemblance to matters of a <HI>higher</HI> nature, and superior importance.—Yet while the <HI>Glory</HI> is earthly, our <HI>Views</HI> earthly, and confined to the pleasures and pursuits of <HI>this</HI> world, our <HI>Affections</HI> are earthly, and we are ren∣dered incapable of <HI>that</HI> LOVE, which is of a divine and <HI>heavenly</HI> nature.</P>
<P>A terrestrial love presides and is prevalent in the minds of many; which has obstructed the power of truth, and been the cause of feeble <HI>purposes</HI> and feeble <HI>efforts,</HI> enfeebled <HI>minds</HI> with irresolute <HI>intentions,</HI> and proved the occasion of a defection amongst Christian professors, who have been desirous to form something more amiable and agreeable, or better adapted to their natural inclinations.—But there is a deficiency in their <HI>Love,</HI> a wavering in <HI>Affection,</HI> a division of Love, which is the cause of weakness and incapacity to make a pro∣per advancement in a Christian life, or improvement in the progressive work of religion upon the soul. For, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I have hinted, while the BODY is terrestrial, the
<PB N="109" REF="016777_0107_0F9E2F511B0C6488"/>GLORY is terrestrial, until we are created anew in Christ Jesus, unto righteousness; wherein our minds will become cloathed with a <HI>celestial</HI> glory, and by the power of Divine Grace, be set above every earthly love: And then the Love of GOD will prevail in our minds, and we shall attain an experience of additional strength, steadily to persevere in the arduous warfare of a Chri∣stian Life. And the Glory being celestial, our views are circumscribed within the limits of an <HI>heavenly</HI> love, wherein we are lifted up to God, being renewed in the spirit of our minds, and enabled to travel on towards the glorious city of the saints solemnity.</P>
<P>But it is a <HI>deficiency</HI> of Love, it is a cleaving to other things, inconsistent with the purity of the Divine Na∣ture, that has slain ten thousands!—A secret defection of <HI>Heart,</HI> which no human eye hath been privy to, has slain more than open Prophanity!—A degeneracy of Heart, a secret sliding from the Covenant of Life, in those who are turning aside into the path of irreligion, and a mental deviation from the purity of holiness; the necessary requisite to an union and divine parti∣cipation in the love of God.</P>
<P>I think it is said with very great propriety, that <Q>The love of money is the root of all evil; which while some have lusted after, they have erred from the faith, and peirced themselves through with many sorrows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. vi. 10.</NOTE></Q>—But though it may seem to many not needful to tell of these things, methinks it is appli∣cable to some in these days who would be deemed <HI>"Men of God;"</HI> and for whom I wish, as for myself, that when the heavens shall roll back as a scroll, and eternity shall open upon us, when our views of these lower objects shall vanish and disappear, when the
<PB N="110" REF="016777_0108_0F9E2F51CCCC5A18"/>Arch-angel's trump shall sound to judgment, and a righteous retribution is made, we may be <HI>found</HI> men of God!—"But, O Man of God," that hast <HI>these</HI> things in view, think on the unutterable prospect of infinite happiness, the reward of obedience, and <Q><HI>flee</HI> these things.</Q> Thee the glory and splendor of this transient world; continue to follow after righteous∣ness, godliness, faith, love, patience, meekness; fight the good fight of faith, lay hold on eternal life, where∣unto thou art called, and hast professed a good profes∣sion before many witnesses.</P>
<P>This is the language of the Love of God to this as∣sembly, that we may be <HI>found</HI> "Men of God," when all the glory of this world, with its splendor and dependencies, shall come to a conclusion; that when every human aid shall vanish, and no worldly assistance is near, the Love of God may cover our spirits in all our trials; that when every human help is totally suspended, we may continue to feel the effects of his mercy and goodness happily to spread in our minds, to their edification and unspeakable joy.—Herein we receive a divine evidence of love, communicated from that boundless Source of unutterable Grace wherewith he has visited us, in order to <HI>dwell</HI> in our hearts, or that He may "dwell in us richly."—And thus we are brought to discern the beauty of holiness, the uni∣formity of love, to open the mind beyond the con∣tracted view of human powers, into the glorious frui∣tion of divine essential Love, the Love of God, that would thus dwell in our hearts and minds; and then we may witness him to be <Q>with us all, always. Amen.</Q> He will be a light to our paths, and an aid at hand, while we are travelling through the va∣rious difficulties and probations in life.—May the Shep∣herd of Israel, <Q>who sleeps not by day, nor slumbers by night,</Q> attend you! and may we place our
<PB N="111" REF="016777_0109_0F9E2F528DAB8EB8"/>whole dependence upon him, as our support and all-sufficient strength in every needful time!</P>
<P>And dearly-beloved youth! you that are entering upon the stage of active life, be ever vigilantly con∣cerned to improve the present moments, and that you may build beyond the habitation of sorrow; that all the high places may be removed, and your minds be∣come replenished with true consolation.—And as you are not always to expect one uniform joyous scene, but clouds of darkness sometimes interrupt the prospects of pleasure, in your pilgrimage through life, prepare your minds, by zealously endeavouring after the Love of God; and wait to know in yourselves, the un∣speakable advantage of his heavenly aid and assistance, offered to conduct you through the various scenes of mortality, to the righteous and awful presence of the Judge of heaven and earth; which will continue to sustain you, when no human consolation can afford relief; even when your offences appear as a flood, surrounded with temptation and distress, and you are ready to cry out, <Q>who shall deliver me from the wrath of an offended Creator!</Q> In this state of anxious solicitude, your heavenly Father is mercifully pleased to arise, and administer relief to such, who are thus "hungering and thirsting after righteous∣ness;" and the cup of life and salvation is handed to their comfort, from the glorious Helper, that in his strength you may be enabled to stand unshaken in the troublous time!—And it is to these he waits to be gracious; a helper at hand, from whom proceeds every power to assist, and every attribute of mercy, kind∣ness, goodness, and adorable condescension, are graci∣ously dispensed to the sons of men, wherein they are established in righteousness and true holiness.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="016777_0110_0F9E2F53692A40F8"/>
"He touches the mountains, and they melt:" every obstruction that would hinder the progress or advancement of this divine, essential, efficacious work of redemption upon the soul, must be removed; every unavailing connexion must give place to the ties of an ardent and sanctified Love.</P>
<P><Q>He touches the mountains, and they melt; the everlasting hills, they bow at his presence.</Q> In his mercy we experience the removing of those things, that oppose or prevent an increase in the knowledge of God, or of the things appertaining to our everlasting peace; in order that the exercised pilgrim in his pro∣gress may receive additional strength, to run with alacrity the race of a christian life, and finally attain an happy union with the sons of the morning, who sing together for joy.</P>
<P>It is the glorious benefits proceeding from the Love of God, which I earnestly entreat that the youth, of all names and distinctions to religion, may carefully seek, and avail yourselves of, that HE may be with you through the various steps of a probationary life. And though you may sometimes have to travel in the exercised path of temptation and anxious distress, con∣tinue in <HI>hope,</HI> and you will feel his LIGHT to arise in your hearts, and witness an inward resurrection unto LIFE; that Life that will never fade, but will remain, when every tender and lawful connexion can no longer comfort, but must soon be dissolved, and the sympathy one for another shall be ineffectual to deliver. All the tender connexions in life are but of uncertain dura∣tion, and upon them all this inscription is wrote, "They shall shortly perish;" but the LOVE of GOD <HI>never fades:</HI>—It is continued from generation to ge∣neration, and will remain when Time shall be swal∣lowed up in Eternity:—It is this wherein we taste of
<PB N="113" REF="016777_0111_0F9E2F561A866BA8"/>the <HI>Goodness</HI> of God, and are made to drink the cup of life and salvation, and have to rejoice in the un∣speakable fruition of happiness it affords to the sanc∣tified in heart, who in future time, as well as the pre∣sent, will have to say, <Q>Spring up, O well, and we will sing unto thee;</Q>—it will remain an enduring portion to the Ransomed in Jacob, and to the Re∣deemed in Israel; and will be an excellent comforter in the time of probation and exercise, through the si∣lent steps of anxiety and secret distress, known to none but GOD and thy own Soul.</P>
<P>He knows ALL things, by whose merciful aid we are sustained through "the Regions of the shadow of Death," when every unavailing relation or human de∣pendency shall disappear and come to an end. What <HI>then,</HI> can sustain us, but the Love of God?—It is that which covers the head in the day of battle; and which I would recommend, with a fervent affection, to you who are the hopes of the present age, that you ar∣dently endeavour after the Love of God, that will never decrease with age; it enlarges upon the mind, and is increased with an increase of Love: It proceeds from the THRONE of God, and spreads from the Threshold of his House: It is continued through the Courts of his Sanctuary, and reaches to the Uttermost Part of the Earth; and is as a <Q>RIVER, the Streams whereof make glad the whole Heritage of God.</Q></P>
<P>All the beauty and splendor of the world will fade; and the excellency of temporal enjoyments, which are the portion of uncertainty, shall shortly know their time and place no more: But the love of God, flowing from Himself, returns upon the sanctifi∣ed soul as a River that never <HI>passeth by,</HI> proceeding from the inexhaustible SOURCE of Love: it spreads through the various states of mankind, and is diffused through∣out
<PB N="114" REF="016777_0112_0F9E2F570F755DF0"/>the spiritual creation of his Son, unlimited as Eter∣nity! A degree of which I feel upon my mind for this assembly, with an ardency that cannot be expressed, "that He may be with you All, always. Amen!"—For the Love of God imparted to the sanctified Soul, and a portion of the Holy Ghost, and Divine Appro∣bation in Communion, hath been such, as <Q>Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath it entered into the heart of man to conceive the good things that God hath in store for them that love him.</Q></P>

<P>This is the bond that binds, and wherein we are united to God, and know it to be a well springing up unto Eternal Life.—It is not in external Helps, nor in the Agreement of Words, neither is it in the Con∣sent of Doctrine, or in fine-spun regular Systems, to constitute a "Communion of the Holy Ghost." But it is as we are admitted to a sacred repast in the di∣vine "Banquetting-house," (wherein we offer the oblation of Worship, a Cloud of Incense, arising from hearts prepared by the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Love of God,) that we are advanced to a divine Communion of the Holy Ghost. A commu∣nion not restrained to any Distinction or Profession of People, but extended to all such as experience an union and Fellowship in Spirit, wherein they are sometimes lifted up to the Father of spirits, and enabled to ap∣proach him "in Spirit and in Truth;" which has often been sealed with the Love and Approbation of God, in a divine manifestation of his kindness and goodness to men, <Q>who eat that which is good, and delight themselves in fatness,</Q> being renewed in the spirit of their minds, and enabled to lay hold on eter∣nal life.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="016777_0113_0F9E2F58AB549EF0"/>
In this Communion, this unutterable, this incon∣ceivable Communion, many have found their <Q>Strength to be renewed,</Q> and their Hearts engaged in the so∣lemn Worship of God, the Author of their being: A communion inexpressible in its nature!—May those minds, who have attained this happy experience, con∣tinue therein in all humility and purity!</P>
<P>It is a Communion in <HI>Spirit,</HI> wherein the sanctified soul approaches the Author of spirits with a Sacrifice in spirit, when the sacrifice of Words shall fail.—For there is a Communion which Language cannot <HI>express!</HI> A Worship that wants not the aid of <HI>Words,</HI> nor is to be defined by an Harmony of Sounds, in which we ap∣proach the sacred Author of unutterable Love!</P>
<P>When there was <Q>Silence in Heaven for about the Space of Half an Hour;</Q> when the Vocal Tribute of "Holy, Holy, Holy," and the Hallelujahs of sanctified Spirits in endless felicity were suspended, their <HI>Worship</HI> continued in awful, holy, solemn, inconceivable SILENCE! It was a Rapturous Adoration, too copious for Language to express! A Cloud of Incense, before the Throne of immaculate Purity and Love!—May our minds be gathered to it, let our Name or profes∣sion to Religion be what it may! and may we experi∣ence this Divine Communion of Saints, and deeply ponder God's unbounded Love, in solemn Silence! For there is no Power of Eloquence can sufficiently ac∣knowledge the Obligation and Reverence we owe HIS Infinite MAJESTY, who fills heaven and earth with his glory and goodness!—But let us look up unto him, and wait to be prepared for it;—for <Q>they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength;</Q>—where∣in we may experience a constant advancement from Grace to Grace, until we attain the glorious end pro∣posed

<HEAD>A SERMON.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is a passage in sacred Writ, which has been revived in my remembrance during the silence of this Meeting, and the train of reflections which it ex∣cited, has sealed instruction to my mind, and furnished me with renewed cause of humiliation and gratitude; <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 37.</NOTE> Men and Brethren, what shall we do to be saved?</Q></P>
<P>Every person who seriously believes in the existence of a God, in a future state, and in the awful doctrine of rewards and punishments, cannot be indifferent re∣specting what may be his lot, when he shall be dispossessed of this frail Tabernacle of clay which he now inhabits, and which is approaching to the Period of its dissoluti∣on; it cannot be a matter of indifference to him, whether he shall finally receive the irrevocable sentence of <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxv. 41.</NOTE> go ye cursed into the regions of irremediable misery;" or<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xxv. 34.</NOTE> come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for the righteous, enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord, and into thy master's rest.</Q> This concern has prompted many to enquire what is essentially necessary for them to believe and practise in order to render them the proper objects of divine complacence, and furnish
<PB N="120" REF="016777_0117_0F9E2F60CFC63540"/>them with a well grounded hope of a glorious and hap∣py immortality. Many of the honest and sincere of eve∣ry Nation under Heaven, have formed different ideas of the requisites to salvation, and of course have pursued as different measures to accomplish that desirable end. It is not my present business, to particularize any of those various systems of Faith, which are adopted by any par∣ty amongst mankind; it is not to controvert matters, in which sincere men of the various denominations most surely believe; but rather to recommend them always to stand open to conviction, and a strict attention to those rules of conduct, which appear to them most agreea∣ble to the will of Heaven. I shall therefore address my∣self to those, in whatever religious society they are found, whose honest inquiries have not yet been attend∣ed with sufficient conviction, or led them clearly to per∣ceive what are the terms on which their future hap∣piness depends, and who are therefore looking one upon another, whilst this important question is found, at least in their hearts if not in their mouths <Q>Men and Bre∣thren what shall we do to be saved?</Q></P>
<P>I shall not presume arrogantly to dictate to any respect∣ing matters of so important a concern as that of the salva∣tion of the Soul; every Man should exercise those talents with which the Father of lights has endued him, in a close and sincere attention to the voice of the internal Teacher, and in the discovery of those truths both prac∣tical and speculative which have an immediate relation to the happiness of a Being circumstanced as he is. I shall simply propose those things which from my own expe∣rience as an individual appear to me worthy of God for their Author, and worthy of Man's most serious atten∣tion. It is an indisputable truth that we made not our∣selves: <Q>We are thine offspring, thou hast made us and not we ourselves,</Q> says the prophet in his appeal to God. The matter which forms the universe, the vehicles which
<PB N="121" REF="016777_0118_0F9E2F61905DAE98"/>the soul informs, and the intellectual powers and facul∣ties we possess, derived their being from the eternal fountain of all power and intelligence, whom we cha∣racterize by the awful names of Jah, Jehovah and God. It is also clear to me that we were brought into existence with the benevolent design of finally sustaining the con∣fluent dignities of Glory, Honour, Immortality and eter∣nal Life; the Lord Almighty hath in unspeakable mercy promised, that after we have endured a season of proba∣tion on earth, a conflict with our passions excited by numerous causes, and a fight of afflictions, we should finally receive a glorious reward, a perpetuity of un∣mixed felicity in the unknown regions of eternity. But this desirable and excellent end is not to be effected by what is generally called fate, the laws of necessity, or the arbitrary will and power of the Author of our existence. God has constituted us free and intelligent beings, and endued us with faculties capable of apprehending and practising those duties which he makes the condition of our final acceptance with him: he offers, but does not impose, happiness on his creatures; he shows us the spi∣ritual Canaan, he gives us power to possess it, but does not compel us to enter into it; good and evil are clearly set before us, but our election is not constrained to either; the sovereign of the universe is no respecter of persons, for of one blood he made all nations that dwell on the face of the earth; they stand in the same relation to the universal Father, Shepherd and Bishop of Souls, who tenderly invites the whole race of Mankind to in∣herit the Joy of his Salvation. To this doctrine the ho∣ly Apostle bore an ample and explicit testimony: <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 34, 35.</NOTE> Of a truth, said he, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons, but in every nation those who fear him and work righteousness shall be accepted of him."—<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Romans viii. 13.</NOTE>"If ye live after the flesh ye shall die, but if through the
<PB N="122" REF="016777_0119_0F9E2F626879CD18"/>spirit ye morify the deeds of the body, ye shall live.</Q> This is a proposition that relates to every individual in the vast community of Mankind, however circumstan∣ced, whether bond or free, or in whatever climate he resides.</P>
<P>All this indeed may be acknowledged both by those within and without the audience of my voice, who are yet in doubt what they shall do to be saved with an everlasting salvation; they want to be informed of the precise ideas that should be affixed to the conditions contained in the text, though perhaps they readily ap∣prehend the terms life and death imply future happiness and misery. I shall therefore attempt according to the ability I am endued with, to give you my thoughts on the important subject in question at this time. To "live after the flesh" is to live in the gratification of our animal appetites and passions, beyond the bounds of reason, temperance and sobriety, which as it frequently introduces numerous disorders into the animal system, and aggravates the infirmities to which these corruptible bodies are incident, so it affects the good of society, and renders unfit for those contemplations and that felicity which is adapted to the dignity of rational and immortal spirits, beings whom God in his wisdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. ii. 7.</NOTE> <HI>has made a little</HI> (and perhaps but a little) <HI>lower than the Angels,</HI> and who would crown them with a superior glory, honour and happiness than that which animal gratifications can con∣fer on their deluded votaries. Whilst we are in the body we must expect to find those appetites, affections and pas∣sions which belong to our nature; but these are to be restricted within the bounds of virtue, and attended to in proportion to our exigencies and necessities, of which the divine principle which God has graciously implanted in our hearts ought to determine.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="016777_0120_0F9E2F630B715DF8"/>
This principle of intelligence although called by a variety of names in the different professions amongst Men, is the same in nature throughout all Mankind. It is the spirit in Man that giveth a right understanding; it is the light that more or less enlightens every Man; it is the word of God in the heart; the word of faith which the Apostle preached to the Gentiles; it is the Grace that hath appeared to all Men, teaching them to deny ungodliness and the world's lusts, and to live so∣berly, righteously and godly in this present world; and finally it is the supreme reason, the law of truth and rec∣titude, the test of virtue and vice, which God himself hath erected in the hearts of all Men; and happy are those who hear and obey it in all things.</P>
<P>I would not be understood to mean that this principle of which I am speaking is designed to instruct us in all truths which the human mind may attempt to investi∣gate, or to give a clear insight into those numerous spe∣culative subjects, which have, not only unprofitably em∣ployed mankind and diverted their attention from more substantial objects, but which have perplexed and divid∣ed them from generation to generation; but by the exercise of it we may apprehend those truths that belong to us, and have an essential relation to the important end of our existence; of which truths the Father of spirits has enabled us to judge; this is implyed by the question which our Lord himself proposed to a people misled by the traditions of their fathers, and who had taken for doctrine the commandments of men, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xii. 57.</NOTE> yea and why judge ye not for yourselves, what is right?</Q></P>
<P>Various are our obligations and duties, religious, rela∣tive and social, arising from our various connexions, natural and divine: The relation we stand in to the Au∣thor
<PB N="124" REF="016777_0121_0F9E2F5D8F6471E8"/>of our being is that of Children; filial fear, obedi∣ence and worship is therefore our indispensible duty to him, in our conduct at all times, throughout our whole lives. The relation which our fellow creatures stand in to us, is that of brethren, children of the same universal Father, and formed for the same glorious and happy end; justice, charity and brotherly kindness are there∣fore our indispensible obligations unto mankind. There are also various accidental relations, such as father, governor, master, servant and numerous others, all which have their correspondent duties. Thus far per∣haps the persons whom I immediately address at this time may concur with me in sentiment, but they as well as I, are perhaps conscious of having failed in nume∣rous instances of discharging their religious duties to God and their social duties to mankind. We have all sinned and fallen short of the glory of God! we have multiplied our transgressions without number! and our iniquities rise before us as a thick cloud! which obscures the brightness of that eternal Sun of righteousness, which would otherwise illuminate our understandings with its marvellous light. Who, therefore, (says the illuminated penitent soul) shall deliver us from the body of this death? who shall take from us the weight of our sins under which we groan incessantly? who shall save us from the wrath to come? "Men and Brethren what shall we do to be saved?" The condition of our recon∣ciliation and redemption are very clearly expressed in the sacred oracles of truth; the placability of the divine nature is repeatedly asserted; he is represented to us in the adorable character of a God of mercy, long suffer∣ing and of unspeakable kindness; as a Being ready to blot out our transgressions from the celestial register, on our sincere repentance, and to remember them no more.</P>

This important and interesting doctrine was typified under the Law, spoken of by the Prophets, and glori∣ously asserted by the Son of God, who is our Mediator with the Father, and the hope of our future Glory. In his character was displayed to Mankind, in the most eminent and striking manner, the provident care, mercy and goodness of God toward the whole rational creati∣on; who like sheep have gone astray from the universal shepherd and bishop of Souls, who have widely wan∣dered from the paths of purity and holiness, which are ways of pleasantness and peace; that path of the just Man, which (like the luminous orb as it arises in our hemisphere) shines with increasing refulgency, splendor and brightness, till it arrives at the meridian altitude of a gloriously perfect day! This path leads all who steadily pursue its direction, by degrees of experi∣ence, through the wilderness of this world to the grand and ultimate end of our Creation, to that compleat frui∣tion of bliss that is figuratively represented to us by <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Heb. xi. 10.</NOTE> a City that hath foundations, whose builder and ma∣ker God is;" a City "<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Isaiah lx. 18.</NOTE> whose Walls are salvation, and whose Gates are eternal praise;</Q> a City that hath no need of the elementary light of Sun, Moon and Stars, "<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rev. xxi. 23.</NOTE> for the Lord God and the Lamb are the light there∣of" a City where God reigns triumphantly amongst his saints, and is to them an inexhaustible fountain of light and felicity; there the weary pilgrim finds an end of all his anxiety and labour, and receives the reward of his faith, the fruition of his hopes, even the salvation of his Soul.</P>
<P>The important message which Christ had in commis∣sion from his Father and our Father, from his God and our God, was, that he compassionated his Creatures, encompassed with the distresses which their sins had
<PB N="126" REF="016777_0123_0F9E2F65D1A5D668"/>brought upon them, that he willed not their everlasting separation from him the source of happiness, that he was willing they should be reconciled to him; he there∣fore called upon them to <HI>Repent and be converted that their sins might be forgiven them, and that they might finally enter into his rest.</HI> This was the interesting doc∣trine which the Saviour of Man promulgated, and hap∣py are those who hear and obey it. <Q>Repent and be converted that your sins may be forgiven you.</Q> It is not the assent of the lip and of the tongue to the glorious truths of the Gospel; but a surrender of the will and affections, a renovation of heart, and conform∣ity to the divine Image, which can alone gain us admis∣sion into the New Jerusalem, the City of God.</P>
<P>If we take an impartial survey of our past lives, re∣view our frequent revoltings, and compare our conduct with the convictions we have often received of right and wrong, virtue and vice, there is scarcely a Soul present but must feel some degree of remorse, some de∣gree of repentance for the turpitude of his morals, and his want of love, obedience and gratitude to so gracious a Father, who has encompassed us with blessings, and preserved us by his providence from the earliest period of our lives to the present hour; we must (I say again) upon serious retrospection, possess some degree of re∣pentance; but unhappily for us the impressions that are made on our minds by such a review of our actions, are frequently erased by the influence which a variety of creaturely objects are suffered to have upon us, and like the early dew they soon pass away. Those who have been cleansed in some degree by the water of con∣trition, are often defiled again by the repetition of that iniquity which in the moments of their humilia∣tion they had determined to renounce and forsake, they are again caught in the snare of their lusts, and capti∣vated by those objects which have a tendency to alienate
<PB N="127" REF="016777_0124_0F9E2F66B12832B0"/>their affections from the supreme good. Thus when the force of conviction again sounds the awakening alarm, they are ready to query with surprise and anx∣iety <Q>what is to be done in this afflictive dilemma to which our inconstancy to our virtuous resolutions has reduced us? shall we despair of that divine mercy we have so often abused, of that goodness we have so long trifled with?</Q> God forbid! rather prostrate your Souls at the Throne of Grace, and humbly im∣plore the continued mercy of the universal parent, as a Father pitieth his Children, so he pitieth them that fear him; he knoweth our frame, he remembereth that we are but dust; beseech him therefore to send forth help from his holy sanctuary, that you may be strength∣ned to renew and keep your Covenants with him; re∣frain from the Commission of evil, and wait on him in the silence of all flesh; since it hath pleased him again to enlighten your darkness, and thus to give you to see yourselves as you are seen of him; he may also be pleas∣ed to enflame your hearts with that celestial fire which purgeth away all the intellectual filth and dross, that prevents the ascent of the Soul godward, and renders it an unfit habitation for his holiness to dwell in. As our backslidings have frequently corrected us and co∣vered our minds with anxiety, let our future conduct directed by his Grace, atone for what is passed, and by a conversation ordered aright, let us glorify our Father who is in Heaven.</P>
<P>I feel at this season the influence (in degree) of that celestial Charity which breathes through Immanuel to the whole creation of God, wishing salvation to every Soul that inhabits the earth; in which I entreat you (as a being subject to the same infirmities which you sometimes unavailably deplore) "repent and be conver∣ted;" repentance you have frequently experienced, but too little I fear of that essential conversion which
<PB N="128" REF="016777_0125_0F9E2F6819B34110"/>the Gospel of Jesus proposes, 'tis highly probable that some persons present have seen the necessity of that reno∣vation of heart and reformation of manners intended by conversion, but urged by the powerful prevalency of their lusts, would if possible find some other remedy for a wounded conscience, than that which the simplicity of the Gospel requires, as a necessary prelude to the favour of God; like the young Man in the Gospel, they have been animated with a desire to be enrolled amongst the disciples of Jesus, who are called Heirs of God and Co-heirs with Christ of that inheritance which is incorruptible and full of Glory; they have asked counsel of the wonderful counsellor, addressing him with this important question, <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mark x. 17.</NOTE> what good thing shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life?</Q> yet when the un∣changeable terms of salvation have been proposed, when they have been told that they must part with all their Idols, they have gone away sorrowful, the terms have appeared too hard for them to comply with; and like Naaman who wanted to be cured of his Leprosy, yet was staggered at the simplicity of the Prophet's direction, are crying out <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Kings v. 12.</NOTE> are not Abana and Pharpar rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel, may I not wash in them and be clean?</Q> thus numbers amongst Mankind are striving to elude the measures which the Gospel of Jesus enjoins, and are substituting others in their stead, which are better adapted to sooth the carnal mind, and prevent that mortification which human nature shrinks from.</P>
<P>Man is desirous to possess the crown of eternal life, but not to bear the Cross; he would indeed reign with Christ, but not suffer with him; he would accompany him to the mount of transfiguration, but not to Gol∣gotha; he would be his attendant at his Glorification, but not in the awful scene of his Humiliation.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="016777_0126_0F9E2F60207C3538"/>
Divers have wandered as from mountain to moun∣tain and from hill to hill, seeking for the living in the Sepulchres of the Dead, they have sometimes adopted one creed, and sometimes another, practised external ordinances, and complied with empty forms, addres∣sing themselves frequently to guides as blind and im∣potent as themselves with this awful inquiry <Q>Men and Brethren what shall we do to be saved?" "I say again, repent and be converted,</Q> for this is the only way to find salvation to your Souls; no external cere∣monies, no verbal confessions, nor any change of opi∣nions merely, can accomplish this repentance and con∣version, and afford you the consequent reward of a glorious immortality, this important work of salvation must be effected in man, by the powerful operation of the Holy Ghost, which is a consuming fire to the ad∣verse part in Man, to the corrupt and perverse will, which would not that Christ should reign in his Kingdom, and that God should be all in all. It is the Baptism of fire (of which John's was but a type) which discriminat∣ing the pure from the impure, gathers the Wheat into the Garner but consumes the chaff with unquenchable burnings.</P>
<P>In the world there are many voices which correspond not with the voice of Christ, the only Shepherd of Souls (whom we ought to hear and obey in all things) but are the voices of those who preach for hire and divine for Money; who look for their gain from their respec∣tive quarters; and as to such conscientious Men who cannot put into their mouths, they are ready to make war against them; these have found it for their worldly interest to lead the deluded people from, rather than to Christ, that glorious High Priest of the Christian Religion; they have attempted to render that mysterious which the Holy Ghost has left clear, and to perplex the under∣standings
<PB N="130" REF="016777_0127_0F9E2F684C812048"/>of mankind with vain metaphysical speculati∣ons, without making them either wiser or better. This class of Men whose God is their belly, and whose Glory is their shame, have indeed proved physicians of no real value; instead of laying the Axe to the root of the corrupt Tree, they have only attempted to lop off some of its branches; they have prescribed emollients, where the most searching operations were expedient; and healing the wound of the daughter of Zion deceit∣fully have lulled, multitudes into a fatal security, flatter∣ing them with hopes which it is to be feared will finally end in disappointment. There are others who assume the Office of Ministers, (the purity of whose intentions my Charity will not permit me to doubt,) who like a Man that attempts to answer a question before he has fully heard it, have too precipitately embarked in the important work of instructing Souls relative to the affairs of salvation; these are like Ephraim <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hosea vii. 8.</NOTE> a Cake not turned,</Q> are not yet instructed in the way of God perfectly, and whilst they are teaching others, had need themselves to be taught what are the first principles of the Oracles of God; they have run on the Lord's errand unsent, and therefore have not essentially profited the people; they have taken upon them to guide those who are inquiring what they shall do to be saved, and have led them indeed from the confines of Egypt, but leave them (undirected to the spiritual Moses) to wander in uncertainty and to compass a mountain of doubts in the wilderness. May the Lord Almighty in his mercy gather these who are wandering as sheep without a Shepherd, and lead them into the sacred inclosure of his fold, into eternal safety.</P>
<P>Let it not be thought from any thing I have said, that I look upon all those who appear girded with the
<PB N="131" REF="016777_0128_0F9E2F690D278DC0"/>linen Ephod, of other Christian societies, either as Impostors, or the deluded votaries of Antichrist; I free∣ly declare, that I doubt not but many of them have had a dispensation of the Gospel committed to them, and although they may be biased by the prejudice of education and the traditions of their Fathers, yet the root of the matter seems to be in them; and I esteem these (in whatever society they are found or in whatever vestments they are cloathed) as my Brethren in the fel∣lowship of the everlasting Gospel of Christ; yet I can∣not direct the searcher after truth who is pensively enquir∣ing what he shall do to be saved, to the Ministry of any Man, but would rather recommend him to the imme∣diate teaching of the word nigh in the heart, even the spirit of God; this is the only infallible teacher, the primary adequate rule of faith and practice, and will lead those who attend to its dictates into the peaceable paths of safety and of truth. <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> John ii. 27.</NOTE> Ye need not (says the holy Apostle to the Church formerly) that any Man teach you, save as this anointing teacheth, which is truth and no lie;</Q> cease therefore from Man whose breath is in his nostrils, and whose existence is but a vapour, for wherein is he to be accounted of? as a falli∣ble being he is liable to frequent deceptions, and there∣fore liable to deceive; whereas the spirit of God cannot be deceived, neither will it deceive any Soul that yields itself to its Government and obeys its dictates.</P>
<P>O ye penitent Prodigals! my Soul earnestly longs for your restoration to the mercy and favour of God! ye who are reduced by your wanderings in the wilderness of this world to a state of extream poverty, to the want of that bread that comes, down from the celestial Regions above, which alone can nourish the Soul up unto eternal Life! ye who are attempting to satisfy the
<PB N="132" REF="016777_0129_0F9E2F69D8C118E0"/>cravings of an immortal spirit with the spiritless husks and shells of an empty profession of Religion! look towards your Father from whom you have revolted; remember that in his House there is bread enough and to spare; there your Souls may be replenished with ever enduring substance: Return, O House of Israel! and seek the face of your everlasting friend and Father! he has in unspeakable kindness declared that he will be found of those who seek him in sincerity of heart, and that as many as knock at the Gate of mercy for an entrance, shall be admitted to his presence, and receive the remission of their Sins.</P>
<P>The humble address which the Prodigal made to his Father (in that excellent parable given us by Christ) the Father's return to it, and the manner of his reception into favour, is exceedingly expressive of the becoming penitence of the one and the mercy of the other <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Luke xv. 21.</NOTE> I have sinned against Heaven and in thy sight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son, make me therefore as one of thy hired Servants.</Q> The injur∣ed parent compassionates his distress, takes the Prodi∣gal in his arms, owns him for his Son; orders the fatted Calf to be killed, and rebukes the envy of his elder Brother with, <Q>this my Son was dead but is alive again, was lost but is found!</Q> O the height and depth of the goodness and mercy of God! look unto him all ye ends of the earth and be ye saved.</P>
<P>Before I conclude, I find it in my Heart to address another class in this Meeting, a class who have earnestly sought and happily sound him of whom Moses and the Prophets did write, Jesus of Nazareth the Immanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us; you who once were scattered as sheep without a shepherd, on the
<PB N="133" REF="016777_0130_0F9E2F6AA5149978"/>barren mountains and desolate hills of an empty profes∣sion, but the Great Shepherd of Souls hath gathered you within the sacred Inclosure of his Sheepfold, and you are under the peculiar protection of the Lord Almighty, you hath he plucked as brands out of the burning, and redeemed to himself with the saving strength of his right Arm; may you ever remember his unutterable mercy, and dedicate the remaining moments of life to the honour of his Name. My Soul salutes you in the endeared affection of the Gospel of peace, and wishes your establishment in Righteousness, that you may abide in holy patience the fiery trial of your faith through∣out the days of your Pilgrimage on earth, and become as fixed pillars in the celestial building, the house of God, that shall go no more out.</P>
<P>If ye abide in the word of faith by which ye have been taught, the malice of Men nor Devils, nor all the united powers of darkness, shall be able to pluck you out of the hand of him, who is your Judge, your King, your Protector, your Father and your everlasting Friend. When the earth shall be wrapped together as a scroll, and the Sun and Moon be darkned, when every Constella∣tion of the Heavens sinks into everlasting obscurity, and the Elements of this world shall melt with fervent heat, you will possess an habitation within the superior regi∣ons of a new Heaven and a new Earth, where the Lord your Righteousness dwells.</P>
<P>Many of the pretended wise, learned and prudent who have sought to climb up some other way, rather than to enter by Christ, who is the door (by the conditions which he has proposed) into the sheepfold, may pity you as fools, or ridicule you as enthusiasts, count your lives madness, and your end to be without honour, but they will one day be astonished at the strangeness of
<PB N="134" REF="016777_0131_0F9E2F6B4A8E29E8"/>your Salvation, when they see to their confusion that you are finally numbered amongst the Children of God, and that the lot of your Inheritance is amongst the Saints. In the World you are to expect tribulations of various kinds; pain, sickness, temptations and disap∣pointments invade the breast of the most righteous and temperate amongst Men; the cup of mixture (more or less impregnated with the wormwood and the gall) is the lot of all Men, designed doubtless to effect a valu∣able purpose, by him who afflicts not willingly, nor without a righteous and benevolent cause, the Children of Men; as the Heavens are higher than the Earth so are the ways of Almighty Wisdom higher than our ways, and his thoughts than our thoughts! We see a little, and but a very little of the amazing universal plan of his Government over rational and immortal spirits. It lies beyond the reach of the most exalted human faculties to comprehend his wisdom, throughout the righteous administration of his Providence, which is unsearchable! It is our duty as frail dependent beings to meet every dispensation of his Providence with that resignation of spirit, which incessantly breathes the hum∣ble language of "not my will O Lord! but thine, be done in all things!" Under the evils which we feel and which our prudence could not prevent, let us rather implore divine aid to endure them with patience, than to pray that they may be removed from us; lest like ignorant Children we should seek to avoid that portion from our Heavenly Father's Hand, which he graciously designed to remove or prevent a greater evil. This is not the place of your rest, but a state of probation, a painful pilgrimage, a Land of pits and snares, through which lies a narrow Path to the regions of eternal Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="135" REF="016777_0132_0F9E2F6DD4711010"/>
The Soul by reason of its connexion with the body, inclosed within the walls of flesh, cannot extend its views and employ its faculties on divine objects, without frequent interruption; but when the days of its captivity are accomplished, it will be capable of a more glorious expansion in the Kingdom of Immortality, and (if bear∣ing the inscription of Holiness) will be put in possession or that Joy which is unspeakable and full of Glory. Therefore in all those calamities to which we are subject in the house of our Pilgrimage, we have a place of re∣fuge to flee to, where safety is alone to be found; though indeed we must feel in degree as Men, yet we may pos∣sess the patience, resignation and holy fortitude of Christians, who are looking for a better Country, a more excellent Inheritance in that City whose Inhabitant cannot say "I am Sick."</P>
<P>Be ye therefore stedfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour shall not be in vain. Be ye in your several stations in the Church, and in the world, as way-marks to the honest inquirers who are asking their way to Zion, and from a true sense of their condition are crying out "what shall we do to be saved?" shew forth by your example of Charity, Sobriety, Temperance and Holi∣ness of Life, that you are redeemed from the spirit of the world, that lies in wickedness; be not captivated by its trifling amusements, nor insnared by its lying vani∣ties, but retain the fear of the Lord which will keep the heart clean, and prove a source of surest consolation when all things else will be unavailing! let the purity of your lives demonstrate that you are attentive to things more excellent, things that are permanent and eternal, essentially relating to the salvation of the Soul! by this means you will become the consecrated Temples of the Holy Ghost, and be a means of leading others in the way of Righteousness!</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="016777_0133_0F9E2F6EB130C9E8"/>
Finally, my Brethren, farewell! I commend you to God, the Shepherd of Israel, and to the word of his Grace; this is alone able to build us up in the most ho∣ly faith, to direct our feet in the way of Righteousness and Peace; and finally to put us in possession of a glo∣rious Inheritance amongst the saints, that will never fade away.</P>

<HEAD>THE HEADS OF A SERMON</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">PREACHED at HORSLEYDOWN MEETING, upon the close of a visit to Friends Families in that Quarter, the 19th of the Eleventh MONTH, 1769.</HEAD>
<P>A SOLEMN summons which the Almighty gave through his Prophet Joel, to a People whom he had known above all the families of the Earth, (at a time when they had revolted and departed in Heart from him) has been revived in my mind; with an ap∣prehension that the same authority requires the repub∣lication of it in this day, to a People likewise highly favoured of him; and who have in like manner depart∣ed from their first love.</P>
<P><Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Joel ii. 15, 16, 17, 18.</NOTE> Blow the Trumpet in Zion—sanctify a fast—call a solemn assembly—gather the People—sanctify the Congregation—assemble the Elders—gather the Chil∣dren and those that suck the breast—let the Bride∣groom go forth of his chamber, and the Bride out of her closet—let the Priests, the Ministers of the Lord, weep between the Porch and the Altar; let them say, spare thy People O Lord! and give not thy heritage to reproach, that the Heathen should
<PB N="138" REF="016777_0135_0F9E2F7094473920"/>rule over them! wherefore should they say amongst the People, where is their God? then will the Lord be jealous over his Land and pity his People.</Q></P>
<P>As I am about to conclude (perhaps finally conclude) my labours amongst you in this Quarter; I would que∣ry with some, with many that are present, whether they have not heard intelligibly the sound of the Trum∣pet, calling them with a degree of certainty, to arise and prepare themselves for the Battle. My Brethren and Sisters, amongst whom I have been constrained in the overflowings of the Fathers Love, to labour in a private capacity, breaking (I hope I may say) a little bread from house to house—the everlasting Gospel has been preached amongst you with all the force of pathe∣tic energy, with all the tenderness of divine compassi∣on; let it not be ineffectual! The Gospel message has been delivered with such indubitable clearness, that your judgments have been convinced, you have assent∣ed to "<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ephesians iv. 21.</NOTE> the Truth as it is in Jesus;" suffer not the im∣pressions it has made on your minds to be speedily eras∣ed. Far, very far, be it from me to think highly of myself, to exalt the Officer, the Minister. I would not that you should hold any Man's person in high esti∣mation. I am deeply sensible that to me belongs <Q>blush∣ing and confusion of face,</Q> but I magnify mine of∣fice, and the power of him who has seen meet to employ me therein; I would endeavour to exalt in your view the adorable goodness and condescension of the great Author of all mercies, in that he has caused the Trum∣pet to be renewedly sounded in your borders; hear its important message with suitable attention; let it rouse and prepare all the ranks in the Armies of our Israel, to engage in the glorious Cause of our God. Let the Daughter of our Zion arise from the bed of
<PB N="139" REF="016777_0136_0F9E2F7159000640"/>Indolence; from the lethargic stupor of a fatal forget∣fulness; from all the deadning benumbing gratifications of sensuality, and shake herself from the dust of the earth, that she may come up to the help of him who hath called her with an high and holy calling. The Trum∣pet is blown in her streets, the alarm has been heard by all, Oh! let not its language be rendered unintelligible by the multiplicity of trivial things that too much ab∣sorb the minds of many.</P>
<P>I am fully persuaded that the gracious Visitation of humbling melting goodness, has been afresh extended to individuals present, in (I had almost said) a very me∣morable manner; nor will I recall the expression, for if it is not treasured up in your remembrance now, for your profit and advantage, it will be memorable in that awful approaching period, when every neglected mercy will appear deeply engraven, as a dread <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Daniel v. 5.</NOTE> Hand∣writing on the wall,</Q> against us. Let me therefore tenderly intreat you, with all the warmth of unutterable affection, as a Brother, as a fellow Pilgrim, through the vicissitudes of time to the unmixed joys of a happy eternity, that you will no longer neglect the offers of Mercy, or turn a deaf ear to the reproofs of Instruction. I feel my mind covered with that boundless Love, that wishes, that ardently desires, you may indeed be wise for yourselves: For although I may be deficient in ma∣ny qualifications of a Gospel Minister, I am not want∣ing in that pure disinterested Love, which seeks not your but you. <Q>Blow the trumpet in Zion; sanctify a Fast.</Q> If we were but enough attentive to the sound of the Trumpet, we should see the absolute necessity of this sanctified fast; a fast from every of those delusive pleasures, those slavish attachments, that render the mind insensible of Good. <Q>Call a solemn
<PB N="140" REF="016777_0137_0F9E2F72100DAE20"/>Assembly.</Q> This branch of the summons (may some say) belongs only to a few, and we have no share in the duty it enjoins. I confess I am of another opinion; I think every Individual has a share in the Instruction couched in it. "Call a solemn Assembly." Oh! you active ones, stop a while in your swift career; make a solemn pause; stand collected from every object that can gratify or delight the sensual part; labour diligently to assemble all the powers and faculties of your Souls, that they may be sanctified by him who gave them. I believe there is no useless, dead, unactive member in the Church of God; and those that can thus assemble the collected attention of a redeemed mind, devoted to do the divine will, have an undoubted right from the highest Authority to call an holy convocation. <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. xii. 8.</NOTE> We can do nothing against the Truth, but for the Truth,</Q> was the language of some formerly, who had indeed sanctified an acceptable Fast. I much desire that those who perhaps cannot be so active in promoting this glo∣rious Cause amongst the Sons of Men, as some who are called into more eminent stations in the Church, may by a circumspect care over all their words and actions, see that they do nothing against the Truth. "Call a solemn assembly; gather the People." How scattered are many of the members of this Quarter! scattered indeed as sheep without a shepherd! dispersed up and down in the dark vale of insensibility and self∣forgetfulness! many upon the barren Mountains of an empty profession; lost to all sense of religious fellow∣ship; unacquainted with that holy union in which is the bond of Peace! How many are the Gallios I have met with amongst you, who (alas! it may be said) care for none of these things! Oh you Elders! who are or might have been as Pillars in the Lord's House; you delegated Shepherds, who might have adorned the first ranks in the armies of our Israel, if you had not sat
<PB N="141" REF="016777_0138_0F9E2F72F6F91308"/>down and taken up a rest short of those glorious abodes, which are prepared for them that steadily persevere in the line of divine appointment—to you the call is, "Gather the People."</P>
<P><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. iv. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> Am I my Brothers keeper!" let it suffice for me that I look to myself, and that my own Family is in tolerable order, is a language that too much prevails. But Oh! that you had the Cause of God more at heart; that you were more engaged to gather the People; that you might, with a Fatherly care, overlook those whose minds at present resemble the barren desert, the uncultivated wilderness; that you might comfort and encourage them that tread the gloomy scenes of an adverse allotment, as it were cut off from every Joy, and alive to each painful sensibility; how would it com∣fort many of these, if an experienced friend was now and then to drop into their families, and at times speak a word, in the opening of divine wisdom, suit∣able to their several states: I believe it would be a great means of gathering the People. Why should your care be circumscribed within the narrow limits of your own Families (altho' they should certainly be well regulated) but you might be more extensively servicea∣ble, if thus engaged in the care of the Houshold of God. I am persuaded that the divine wing would be over you, and a Blessing would attend your labours. 'Tis not a time for us to dwell unconcerned in our ceiled Houses, when the House of God lies waste. We have, many of us, the same tender connexions as you; I myself have the same endearing attachments as <HI>some</HI> of you, the same ties of domestic Love, and per∣haps as deeply sensible of all their force, as some of you; not less attentive to every relative and social duty, than some of you; my Nature is not harsh, my Prin∣ciples much less so; yet I am made willing to leave all,
<PB N="142" REF="016777_0139_0F9E2F75A48B3D68"/>to come and labour with you; if so be I might be in∣strumental to rouse any to a more arduous pursuit of their everlasting Interest; and I can freely acknowledge, with humble thankfulness, that I never more fully ex∣perienced my Peace to flow as a River; never could with greater Joy say <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psal. cxvi. 7.</NOTE> return Oh! my Soul to the place of thy rest, for the Lord thy God hath dealt bountifully with thee,</Q> than when I have been thus engaged in extensive private labours; visiting the sick; reviving the sorrowful; encouraging the disconsolate; strengthening the weak; watching over and carefully admonishing the giddy incautious Youth; and I doubt not but you would have the reward of Peace in your own bosoms, if as heads of the society you were more often thus employed in endeavouring to <Q>gather the People.</Q></P>
<P>"Sanctify the Congregation; assemble the Elders." I have been deeply concerned to see some of the Elders so deficient in filling the line of divine appointment. If they were more frequently engaged to assemble un∣der the holy influence of that power in which they should move, they would many of them be command∣ed to "blow the Trumpet in Zion; but I know of no state harder to speak to or more difficult to reach, than that of an Elder whose mind is overgrown by the earthly nature; <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxii. 29.</NOTE> Oh!

<P>"Gather the Children." You that have the rising Youth under your care, let me call upon you, let me
<PB N="143" REF="016777_0140_0F9E2F7686AEA1E0"/>intreat you to "gather the Children;" gather them from all the bewitching enticing allurements of the world, gather their attention to that of God in their own minds. Oh! how have I secretly <HI>mourned</HI> to see the poor Children so sorrowfully neglected; so unin∣structed; so much estranged to that holy divine principle, which would so exceedingly beautify and enrich them! but alas! how few Parents are rightly qualified to teach their Children the law of divine love; to instill into their tender minds proper sentiments, to cultivate up∣on them those impressions that would be of everlasting advantage; and if the Children, when the gracious visitation of the Father of mercies moves upon their hearts, warming and animating them with the Love of Virtue, raising the secret sigh, and begetting desires after Heaven and Holiness: I say if the Children should then ask the negligent parent; <Q>what is this secret something which I feel; this principle which im∣presses my mind with the love of Virtue? what is it? what value shall I set upon it?</Q> How then can you give them suitable instruction? you cannot teach them obedience to its sacred dictates, when your own example speaks a language quite opposite: Oh! why should the Sea Monster be brought against you <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lament. iv. 3. Job xxxix. 14, 15.</NOTE> the Sea Monster draweth forth the breast to her Young, but the Daughter of my People is become cruel, like the Ostrich in the Wilderness that leaveth her Eggs in the Sand to be hatched by the beams of the Sun, and considereth not that the Foot of the Pas∣senger may crush them!</Q>—the Daughter of my Peo∣ple hath lest her tender Offspring to the uncertainty of being accidentally benefited, or I should rather say, to the Mercy of God, unasked, unsought, exposed to all the dangers of a dreary Wilderness, unaided unas∣sisted by the Care of a natural Parent! The Tongue
<PB N="144" REF="016777_0141_0F9E2F7693D37080"/>of the sucking Child cleaveth to the roof of its Mouth for thirst! the Children ask Bread and there is none in many Families to break it, they want to be nourished by the sincere Milk of the word, but alas! <Q>the Daughter of my People is become cruel!</Q> Oh! you Parents, you delegated Shepherds, what account will you have to render when the Lord of the whole Earth ariseth to make inquisition for Blood!</P>
<P>Bear with me my beloved Friends; flattery and smooth tales may please Fools, but they will not please him whom I desire to serve in the Gospel of his Son. All that is within me is moved, while I thus earnestly expostulate with you on behalf of the dear Children; suffer me to intreat you, for God's sake, for your own Soul's sake, for the sake of the Cause of Truth, "Gather the Children, and those that suck the breast;" those that are filling themselves with the World's con∣solation, with the intoxicating pleasures and amuse∣ments of a degenerate age; wean them from these de∣lights; gather them to the knowledge of themselves, to a sense of the Mercies that are offered them by the great Author of Mercies ancient and new. <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Kings xx. 40.</NOTE> While thy Servant was busied hither and thither the Man made his escape,</Q> was the vain excuse of the Offi∣cer to whose custody a certain Captive was committed with this charge, <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid xx. 39.</NOTE> take care of this Man till I come, and if thou let him go, thy life shall go for his life.</Q> No plea of other engagements, nor even the want of ability to discharge our duty towards our Offspring will stand us in any stead; if, when the Almighty queries with us <Q>What hast thou done with those Lambs I left under thy care in the wil∣derness, those tender Offsprings I gave thee in charge!</Q> we have through neglect, through un∣watchfulness suffered him or her to go, but we shall
<PB N="145" REF="016777_0142_0F9E2F781358F508"/>most certainly, stand accountable for his or her Life. I said want of ability, because I assuredly believe, that want of ability will be so far from a palliation of our Crime, that it will rather increase our condemnation; can we plead want of ability to him who is always ready to furnish us with it, if we are but willing to receive it at his Hand!.</P>
<P>I am of opinion respecting many of our Youth, that if they had been properly instructed, and carefully watched over, if they could have seen the beauty of Holiness shine in the example of their Parents, they would not have gone out so widely as they have. Oh! you Parents of both sexes, an important trust is repos∣ed in you; example your Children in the practice of Piety; example speaks louder, much louder, than pre∣cept; its influence is far more extensive. And while on the one hand you are excited to a faithful discharge of your duty towards them, by the certain hope of a glorious reward; so on the other hand, the powerful ties of natural affection, the warm solicitude for the happiness of those you love, must stir up to diligence in the work and service appointed you.</P>
<P>"Gather the Children." If after your attentive care has been employed, for their preservation; if after by the forceable voice of example, you have called them to the perfecting of holiness in the fear of God, they <HI>will</HI> go, they <HI>will</HI> turn aside into the byways and crook∣ed paths of sin and iniquity, they must stand by their own choice; you have redeemed your Souls, and will be found in your lots at the end of time, a ponderous Crown awaits you, you will close your eyes, and open them to the boundless fruition of unmixt Joy, in a happy eternity.</P>
<P><PB N="146" REF="016777_0143_0F9E2F78CBAD9BD8"/>
We do sometimes with sorrow observe, the unweari∣ed labours of a Parent's love, bestowed without the de∣sired effect; 'tis <HI>mournful</HI> to see Children pierce with bitterness and anxiety the breast that has been their support in their infantile years; to fill that eye with sorrow, that has dropt over them the tear of maternal fondness! 'tis a cruel thing for a Child to mingle Gall and Wormwood, in the cup of a Parent descending to the Grave; let us be assured that their own portion of Gall and Wormwood will be doubly increased thereby, in the solemn hour of just Retribution! But, Oh belo∣ved Youth! I earnestly desire that you may never thus widely deviate from the paths of rectitude; 'tis on you the hope of the present age must shortly devolve; may you wisely choose an early submission to the holy dis∣cipline of the Cross of Christ, that you may come up as an Army for God. Consider the uncertainty of your stay here; consider the important business of Life; and let the love of every unprofitable delight, be swal∣lowed up in the arduous pursuit of Glory, Honour, Immortality and Eternal Life. We are daily instruct∣ed by the powerful eloquent language of Mortality; Death invades all ranks, snatches those of all ages from the busy stage of life, she that was yesterday sur∣rounded with nuptial Joys, must to-morrow be confined within the cold inclosure of the silent Grave. <Q>Let the Bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the Bride out of her Closet;</Q> let the young, the joyous; those that are in the bloom of life, leave every thing that tends to retard their progress towards the City of the Saints solemnity; let them relinquish their most exalted satisfactions, rather than neglect to lay hold on the Joys of God's Salvation; which are unutterably more desirable, than all the sin-pleasing gratifications that this World can bestow.</P>
<P><Q>Let the Priests, the Ministers of the Lord weep between the Porch and the Altar;</Q> this should not
<PB N="147" REF="016777_0144_0F9E2F798D698478"/>be confined to those only whose mouths may be open∣ed publickly amongst you, for it belongs to all those who Preach to others by the regularity of a Godly life and conversation; although we are favoured with a living ministry of divine appointment, who dare not fill the ears of Men with a repetition of unfelt Truths, nor amuse them with the unprofitable productions of an empty mind, but are concerned to discharge themselves faithfully <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. iv. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> as stewards of the mysteries of God</Q> yet let them be joined by all those that mourn for the desolation of Zion; by all that wish Peace within her Walls and prosperity within her Palaces, Let us weep between the Porch and the Altar, saying <Q>Spare thy People O Lord! and give not thy Heri∣tage to reproach, that the Heathen should rule over them! wherefore should they say among the People, where is their God?</Q> If we are thus unitedly en∣gaged on behalf of our Israel it may be that the Lord will again "be jealous over his land" with an holy jealousy, for I cannot think that a People whom he has raised by his own invincible power, and so signal∣ly placed his name amongst, were ever designed to be only the transient Glory of a couple of centuries; I am still revived by a secret Hope of better times, when our Zion shall again put on her beautiful Garments; and in her, and with her, shall arise Judges as at the first, and Counsellors and Lawgivers as at the beginning; let us weep between the Porch and the Altar; let us interceed for the People that the land may yet be spar∣ed! the gracious ear of our Heavenly Father is still open to the supplications of his Children, and I believe he will yet <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Joel ii. 18.</NOTE> be jealous over his Land and pity his People.</Q> The time approaches when the great dasher in pieces will more and more come up amongst us, and may all who are broken by him, wait to be healed by the arising of his Love; I shall not live to see it, but
<PB N="148" REF="016777_0145_0F9E2F7A6FE3CFB8"/>I live in the Faith, and I believe I shall die in the Faith, that the Lord of Hosts will yet beautify the place of his Feet, that our <Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah lx. 15. lxii. 7.</NOTE> Zion will yet become an Eternal excellency, and Jerusalem the praise of the whole Earth!</Q></P>
<P>Let us weep between the porch and the Altar with unwearied intercession, for <Q>the Lord will yet be jea∣lous over his Land and pity his People.</Q> The bowels of adorable Compassion yet yearn over his Chil∣dren, with all the tenderness of a Father's Love, <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hosea xi. 8.</NOTE>. How shall I give thee up O Ephraim? How shall I make thee as Admah and set thee as Zeboam?</Q> How shall I cut thee off from being a People before me? by this moving and pathetic language would the Great Father of the Universe induce you to return to the Arms of everlasting Mercy! And if we who are placed as Watch∣men in Zion faithfully discharge the trust reposed in us, we shall be made Instrumental in gathering the scattered and dispersed Sheep, from the East and from the West, from the North and from the South, to the great Shepherd, to the one Sheepfoid; and finally ob∣tain an admittance into those glorious Mansions where the morning Stars join in Singing Hallelujahs! and where all the Sons of God forever shout for Joy.</P>
<P>Now unto the King Eternal, Immortal, Invisible, the only God! be Honour and Praise for ever and ever.</P>
