<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>T is a pleasant and wondrous Thing, to see Souls flying to JESUS CHRIST, to the Means of Grace and Salvation which He has ordained and sanctified, and into his Church. If this were not the proper and natural Sense of the <HI>Prophet</HI>'s Words, I would not have chose them for the Opening the present <HI>Lecture.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>dear People,</HI> Your <HI>Ministers</HI> have with Pleasure seen you in the Weeks past, Old and Young, Parents and Children, Masters and Servants, high and low, rich
<PB N="6" REF="004490_0004_100D585BF3F8DAF8"/>and poor together, gathering and passing as <HI>Clouds</HI> in our Streets, and as <HI>Doves</HI> on the Wing in Flocks flying to the Doors and Windows of our Places of Worship; and hovering about the same, those that could not get in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Fame</HI> of a singular fervent and <HI>holy Youth,</HI> an ex∣traordinary Servant and Minister of JESUS CHRIST, (who makes his <HI>Angels Spirits,</HI> and his <HI>Ministers a Flame of Fire)</HI> had prepar'd you for his <HI>Visit;</HI> and with raised Expectations we received him, even as an <HI>Angel of</HI> GOD for JESUS sake; as the Apostle St. <HI>Paul</HI> was received by the Churches in <HI>Galatia.</HI></P>
<P>GOD gave him a wonderful <HI>Manner of Entrance</HI> among us, just as in other Places before us, among the <HI>Brethren</HI> of our Denomination; and we were sometimes <HI>melted</HI> together in Tears, Ministers and People, Parents and Children, under the commanding <HI>Addresses of Love</HI> to his <HI>Saviour</HI> and our <HI>Souls.</HI> We led you with a visible Pleasure in our Faces to the solemn and great <HI>Assemblies,</HI> and look'd on You there with great Satis∣faction, in your uncommon Regards to the Beloved <HI>Ser∣vant of</HI> CHRIST, for the <HI>Truth's sake that dwelleth</HI> in Him, and the <HI>Love of the Spirit</HI> filling him, and reigning in his Ministrations to us.</P>
<P>And now our beloved <HI>Brethren and Sisters,</HI> You and your <HI>Children,</HI> we are going to <HI>prove,</HI> confirm and in∣crease, by the Will of GOD, the seeming good Dispo∣sitions begun or revived in You, toward CHRIST and his <HI>Word,</HI> in a just and reasonable pious Care and <HI>Solli∣citude</HI> for your Salvation.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Whitefield</HI> once and again in his <HI>Admonitions</HI> to You, and also in his <HI>fervent,</HI> righteous and <HI>effectual Prayers</HI> for you (by the Will of GOD) led you into <HI>this Trial</HI> and Proof of your selves;—"Whether when he was gone from us, you wou'd <HI>better attend</HI> on the Mi∣nistry of your <HI>own Pastors,</HI> both on <HI>Sabbaths</HI> and <HI>Lectures?</HI> For he had <HI>heard</HI> (and it was but too <HI>true</HI>) that there had been a very great <HI>Defect</HI> in this Point among you
<PB N="7" REF="004490_0005_100D585EE3A751C0"/>before he came.—Some of your <HI>Ministers</HI> therefore now make a new <HI>Tender</HI> of themselves to you, in the Fear and Love of GOD, in this <HI>new Lecture,</HI> for the Service of your Souls, if you will encourage them by something of a <HI>like Attendance</HI> on it, as we have lately seen you give to the Word preach'd. — We preach the same CHRIST, the same <HI>Doctrines of Grace,</HI> and <HI>according to Godliness,</HI> with the same Gospel <HI>Motives</HI> and Argu∣ments, Applications to Conscience, and Supplications to GOD for You.— We would look on the <HI>Fields,</HI> and be∣hold them <HI>white</HI> for the <HI>Harvest,</HI> and desire to <HI>enter</HI> into it; if by the Help of GOD we may <HI>cherish</HI> the Impres∣sions made on any of your Souls, and carry them on, clinching the <HI>Nails</HI> driven by the <HI>Master of Assemblies</HI> that has been sent among us.—For though we are <HI>Elder Ministers,</HI> and have been many Years before Him in the Service of Souls, and <HI>He</HI> like <HI>David</HI> going against <HI>Goliah,</HI> in the Sight of the <HI>Armies of Israel,</HI> has been seen to be but a <HI>Youth</HI> and <HI>Stripling;</HI> yet are we not unwilling or ashamed to come and serve <HI>after Him,</HI> in the <HI>Battles</HI> of our LORD, and in the <HI>Victories</HI> of his Grace. — You have seen, as it were, a young <HI>Elias,</HI> or the <HI>Baptist</HI> risen again, a <HI>burning and shining Light,</HI> and you were <HI>willing for the Season to rejoice in his Light and Heat:</HI> May <HI>we</HI> now <HI>preach</HI> and <HI>you hear</HI> for the <HI>future</HI> with more Life and Spirit, Diligence and Constancy; and by the Will of GOD with new <HI>Success.</HI>— But we mean not, <HI>Bre∣thren,</HI> at <HI>this Lecture</HI> only, but on <HI>every</HI> Sabbath and <HI>every</HI> Lecture in the Town; and more particularly on the public <HI>Thursday Lecture;</HI> which has been shamefully neglected by the <HI>Town.</HI></P>
<P>To come then to my <HI>Text,</HI> which I acknowledge the late <HI>Concourse</HI> to the <HI>Word</HI> among us, has led me to chuse. I wou'd now look round on the <HI>present Assembly,</HI> and look back on our <HI>past</HI> Assemblies, and say to You,—</P>
<P><Q><HI>Who are these that fly as a Cloud, and as the Doves to their Windows?</HI></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Prophet</HI> was here meditating the <HI>Glory</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> in the abundant <HI>Access of the Gentiles</HI> to it.
<PB N="8" REF="004490_0006_100D58611B4DBF00"/><HI>Arise, shine,</HI> (says he Ver. 1.) <HI>for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the</HI> LORD <HI>is risen upon thee.</HI> It was a <HI>light∣some</HI> Thought to the holy Prophet, the <HI>inlarged</HI> State of the Church, after its long <HI>Confinement</HI> within the nar∣row Bounds of <HI>Judea;</HI> and after its Diminution and <HI>Obscuration</HI> by the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Captivity. He foretels, <HI>V.</HI> 2, this Time of <HI>Darkness</HI> covering the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>gross Darkness the People;</HI> out of which the Church shou'd <HI>emerge,</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles come to her Light, and Kings to the Brightness of her rising.</HI> Ver. 3.</P>
<P>Wherefore, <HI>Ver.</HI> 4, she is call'd upon to <HI>lift up her Eyes,</HI> and <HI>see round about,</HI> the People gathering and <HI>flow∣ing</HI> to her. And though at <HI>first</HI> there might be some <HI>Fear</HI> and Distrust, as <HI>Peter</HI> felt, when he was about to go unto the <HI>Uncircumcised;</HI> yet that wou'd be <HI>soon over,</HI> and her narrow <HI>doubting</HI> Heart <HI>enlarg'd</HI> with Joy; (<HI>V.</HI> 5.) because of the <HI>Abundance of the Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Forces of the Gentiles,</HI> coming to her.— This Accession of the <HI>Gen∣tiles</HI> to CHRIST is further represented, <HI>Ver.</HI> 6, 7, by the <HI>Multitudes of Camels, laden with Incense</HI> and <HI>Offerings of Gold;</HI> and the <HI>Flocks of Kedar</HI> presenting themselves for <HI>Sacrifices</HI> to the <HI>Altar</HI> of GOD. The Riches of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> together with their Hearts, devoted to GOD in and through CHRIST, for the setting up and supporting his <HI>Instituted Worship,</HI> is the Thing here represented.</P>
<P>And thus (says the HOLY ONE, in the Words im∣mediately preceeding my Text) <HI>will I glorify the House of my Glory.</HI>—GOD'S <HI>Church</HI> is the House of his <HI>Glory,</HI> where he is <HI>glorified</HI> by his People, and where he <HI>glorifies</HI> himself in his <HI>Grace</HI> to them. The <HI>Promise</HI> is here, to make it <HI>more glorious</HI> than ever. The <HI>Christian Church State</HI> makes it so: The <HI>Ministration</HI> of the <HI>Law</HI> was <HI>glorious,</HI> but the <HI>Gospel exceeds in Glory.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the <HI>Vision of this</HI> it is, that the <HI>Prophet</HI> as in a Surprize and Extasy <HI>exclaims,</HI> in the Words of my Text, "<HI>Who are these that fly as a Cloud, and as the Doves is their Windows.</HI> He mightily admires this <HI>flocking of Converts to</HI> CHRIST.
<Q>The <HI>Manner</HI> wherein he
<PB N="9" REF="004490_0007_100D5863E23E8290"/>expresses his <HI>Admiration</HI> is more <HI>elegant</HI> and moving, than if he had only said,— I see an <HI>infinite Number</HI> coming into the Church. He speaks <HI>magnificently</HI> of the thing, says <HI>Calvin,</HI> and as wanting Words to utter his Wonder and Joy.</Q>— When the <HI>Church</HI> return'd from <HI>Babylon,</HI> she left many a <HI>Proselyte</HI> to the true GOD <HI>behind</HI> her, and some <HI>follow'd</HI> her; but <HI>those</HI> were a small <HI>First-fruit,</HI> and as the <HI>Sheaf</HI> in token of the <HI>Harvest.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Prophecy</HI> began eminently to be fulfilled in the wonderful Conversions to CHRIST, by the preaching of his <HI>Apostles. "The Isles shall wait for me;"</HI> are the Words following my <HI>Text;</HI> the many <HI>Isles</HI> in the <HI>Medi∣terranean</HI> were soon visited, and the remote <HI>Isle</HI> of <HI>Great-Britain</HI> very soon, considering its Distance, and Separa∣tion from the <HI>Continent.</HI></P>
<P>But the Prophecy is <HI>daily</HI> fulfilling, and at <HI>Times</HI> in a more remarkable Measure; but more especially it will be so in the <HI>latter</HI> and more happy Days of the Church, when the <HI>Calling of the Jews</HI> and the <HI>Fulness of the Gen∣tiles</HI> shall come on.— The LORD hasten the promis'd Day.</P>
<P>It is the <HI>Power of Godliness,</HI> and the <HI>saving Conversion</HI> of Souls that is here spoken of. The bare outward Pro∣fession, the <HI>Name and Form</HI> alone, without the Power of Religion, were not <HI>worthy</HI> of this Affection and Joy; <HI>Who are these that fly,</HI> &amp;c. We have not so <HI>learned</HI> CHRIST, as to speak thus of any thing short of the <HI>saving Efficacy</HI> of the preached Gospel on the Hearts and Lives of Men, "<HI>turning them from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto</HI> GOD. In this <HI>Sense</HI> let us con∣template and admire the <HI>Event</HI> in my Text, "<HI>Who are these that fly as a Cloud,</HI> &amp;c!</P>
<P>In which Words is represented, 1. The <HI>Number and Multitude</HI> of Converts to CHRIST. 2. Their Speed, <HI>Swiftness,</HI> Eagerness, Earnestness. 3. The <HI>Pleasure</HI> GOD has in this <HI>Event,</HI> and <HI>Souls</HI> shou'd have in it; both Mi∣nisters and People.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004490_0008_100D586627BB5748"/>
And so the <HI>Doctrine</HI> is, That it is a pleasant and ad∣mirable Thing, to see Souls <HI>flocking</HI> and <HI>hastning to</HI> CHRIST.</P>
<P>But I will dwell a little more on the <HI>Phraseology</HI> of the Text, "There shou'd be a flying as the <HI>Cloud</HI> before the <HI>Wind:</HI> and as the <HI>Doves</HI> on the <HI>Wing,</HI> to their <HI>Windows.</HI></P>
<P>And 1. Let it be as a <HI>Cloud before the Wind,</HI> a Thing common in these <HI>lower Heavens</HI> about us, the <HI>Atmosphere</HI> wherein we breathe and move: for the Clouds come <HI>down</HI> sometimes to our very Houses, and terribly in their <HI>Lightnings</HI> and <HI>pestilential</HI> Vapours.—But when the Cloud is <HI>light</HI> and flies <HI>high,</HI> we see it cross the Heavens <HI>swiftly,</HI> on the Wings of the Wind. — The <HI>Cloud</HI> spreads <HI>wide</HI> at Times, overspreads the Face of the Sky, or a great Part of it, and then may well stand for a <HI>Multitude:</HI> A <HI>Cloud,</HI> i. e. a <HI>Croud</HI> of People; as when we read of "<HI>so great a Cloud of Witnesses,</HI> Heb. xii. 2. a <HI>few</HI> of which had been enumerated. So spake the Prophet <HI>Eze∣kiel,</HI> Chap. 38. of <HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> the Enemies of GOD and his <HI>Israel; "Thou shalt be as a Cloud to cover the Land, thou and all thy Bands and many People with thee.</HI></P>
<P>Again, the <HI>Cloud</HI> flies in the <HI>open Heavens,</HI> in the open Sight; and so shou'd <HI>we</HI> be <HI>open,</HI> in the View of all, confessing CHRIST and coming into his Church; with a conspicuous Zeal, that may appear to Friends and Foes. We may not be <HI>asham'd</HI> of the Name of CHRIST, nor <HI>cover</HI> our Profession, nor <HI>fear</HI> to express a <HI>Zeal</HI> for his Cause, Interest and Glory. Let the <HI>timerous Master in Israel</HI> come <HI>alone to</HI> JESUS <HI>by Night;</HI> but let his <HI>Disciples</HI> chuse rather to go in <HI>a Body</HI> and by <HI>Day.</HI> We read of the <HI>risen Witnesses of</HI> CHRIST, that they heard a <HI>Voice</HI> from <HI>Heaven,</HI> to them saying, "<HI>Come up hither!</HI> and they <HI>ascended in a Cloud,</HI> and as a Cloud, and their <HI>Enemies beheld them.</HI> In Allusion to which, all that pro∣fess the glorious Name of CHRIST shou'd make <HI>one Cloud of Witnesses,</HI> and <HI>ascend</HI> up after Him, Earth and Hell looking on: Phil. iii. 3. <HI>We are the Circumcision, that
<PB N="11" REF="004490_0009_100D586807DDA048"/>worship</HI> GOD <HI>in the Spirit, and rejoice in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Again, the <HI>Cloud flies irresistibly;</HI> no Art or Power of Man can <HI>stop</HI> it; so our Profession of the Name of CHRIST must be <HI>above any Obstruction,</HI> Let or Impedi∣ment, from Earth or Hell. There shou'd be a Faith and Love and Zeal, that shall carry us <HI>above</HI> Temptati∣ons, Difficulties and <HI>Oppositions!</HI> an open and <HI>effectual Door</HI> shou'd be <HI>open'd,</HI> which <HI>none</HI> shou'd be able to <HI>shut;</HI> a <HI>Love which many Waters shall not quench, nor the Floods drown.</HI> Once more.</P>
<P>As the Clouds fly <HI>high,</HI> so our Hearts and Affections shou'd be <HI>rais'd</HI> and <HI>elevated</HI> above the <HI>World</HI> and all <HI>Earthly</HI> Things that <HI>wou'd draw them down.</HI> We must be <HI>looking to</HI> JESUS <HI>at the right Hand of</HI> GOD, <HI>and set our Affections on Things above;</HI> as <HI>risen with Him</HI> and ascend∣ing after him in heavenly Frames and Aspirations, to be <HI>with him where he is.</HI></P>
<P>Or, 2. Let the Flight of Souls to CHRIST be <HI>as the Doves to their Windows;</HI> which is the other, and more pleasant <HI>living,</HI> lively Part in the Comparison; or what is there among the <HI>winged Fowl</HI> of Heaven, more <HI>beauti∣ous, clean</HI> and <HI>innocent,</HI> more <HI>meek, loving</HI> and <HI>lovely</HI> than the <HI>Doves!</HI> As the <HI>Descent</HI> of the HOLY GHOST on the LAMB OF GOD at his <HI>Baptism</HI> is likened to that of the <HI>Dove;</HI> so how pleas'd shou'd our <HI>Souls</HI> be, to have their <HI>Ascent to</HI> CHRIST illustrated by this Similitude!</P>
<P>The <HI>Doves hasten</HI> on their Wings, and fly <HI>swiftly;</HI> more especially as they return to their <HI>Windows;</HI> with Pleasure and Joy they <HI>dart</HI> and light there. So let us be <HI>glad</HI> to go to the <HI>House</HI> of the LORD, and there let our <HI>Feet rest.</HI> Why are we <HI>loth</HI> at any Time to go? why make we no more <HI>haste</HI> and speed to JESUS CHRIST, to find <HI>Rest</HI> for our Souls, <HI>Food,</HI> Dwelling, and a Place of <HI>Safety;</HI> a Covering from the <HI>Wind and Tempest,</HI> and from the <HI>Powers of the Air</HI> that would devour us; the <HI>Hawk and Vultur?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004490_0010_100D586A36B71098"/>
How eagerly do the <HI>Doves</HI> fly home at any <HI>Noise,</HI> or upon the least fright? so will the convinced and awakned terrified <HI>Sinner,</HI> in the great Sense of his <HI>Danger</HI> by Distance from his <HI>Saviour, flee</HI> to Him as his only Shelter, and Place of <HI>Refuge;</HI> he <HI>flies</HI> to Him to <HI>hide</HI> him, even to the <HI>Shadow of his Wings;</HI> for thus has the LORD shewn himself as with <HI>Wings</HI> unto his <HI>Doves.</HI></P>
<P>Awakned Sinners have this <HI>Sight</HI> of CHRIST, as a <HI>prepared,</HI> ready and open Place of <HI>Salvation</HI> for them; and on the <HI>Wings</HI> of earnest Desire, Faith and Love, Fear and Prayer, they speed them to their Windows, his <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>Ordinances,</HI> or to their <HI>Closets,</HI> his <HI>Chambers</HI> and theirs, where he is always present to help and succour.</P>
<P>The Doves fly in <HI>Flocks</HI> unto their Windows; with strong Inclination and <HI>one Consent</HI> they return thither; seeming eager which shall light <HI>first,</HI> they light together, and cover the desir'd Spot: And so should the gathering to CHRIST be, and into his Church; more general and <HI>universal.</HI> Not, as it is with us commonly, <HI>now and then a single Soul;</HI> but as it was in the Beginning of the Chri∣stian Church, when they came in <HI>Thousands,</HI> and were <HI>pricked to the Heart;</HI> and the LORD <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> daily to the Churches of them that should be saved.</HI> So in <HI>David</HI>'s Time, they went in <HI>Multitudes,</HI> the <HI>Tribes went up</HI> from every Village and City, meeting on the Way, <HI>from Strength to Strength,</HI> the Numbers increasing by Con∣course.</P>
<P>The Doves fly by <HI>Instinct</HI> for Food, Company and Rest; and so the <HI>new Nature</HI> to CHRIST for spiritual <HI>Sustenance</HI> and the <HI>Fellowship of Saints,</HI> the <HI>Fellowship of the</HI> SPIRIT, Communion with CHRIST: there is <HI>no Rest for the Sole of their Foot</HI> but in HIM. Where can the Soul, <HI>created anew in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, be at <HI>home</HI> but in HIM. Cant. i. 7. <HI>Tell me, thou whom my Soul loveth, where thou feedest!</HI> The Food for them is scat∣tered from time to time on their <HI>Windows,</HI> to invite and keep them there, for their spiritual Nourishment.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004490_0011_100D586D09E704D8"/>
There they congregate, <HI>propagate and increase;</HI> they love their <HI>Windows</HI> for Company and Society: and tho' they are <HI>not perfect</HI> in Love, (for there are <HI>peckings</HI> and fightings among the <HI>Doves</HI> themselves; they have too much <HI>Gall</HI> in 'em) yet are they an allowed <HI>Emblem</HI> of <HI>Mildness and Sweetness</HI> of Nature, <HI>Mekness and Gentle∣ness;</HI> as <HI>Christians</HI> should converse and worship together in the <HI>Meekness and Gentleness of</HI> CHRIST, and in the <HI>Love of the Spirit; harmless as Doves.</HI> — <HI>"Be ye so,"</HI> are our LORD'S own Words to us; and "<HI>learn it of me</HI> has he said, "<HI>for I am meek and lowly in Heart, and ye shall find Rest for your Souls.</HI> To which agrees the ear∣nest Address and even Supplication of the <HI>Apostle</HI> to us, Col. iii. 12. "<HI>Put on therefore, as the Elect of</HI> GOD, <HI>holy and beloved, Kindness, Humbleness of Mind, Meekness, Charity; and let the Peace of</HI> GOD <HI>rule in your Heart, to which you are called in one Body, and be ye thankful: Let the Word of</HI> GOD <HI>dwell in you richly in all Wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms, Hymns and spiritual Songs; and whatever ye do in Word or Deed, do all in the Name of the</HI> LORD JESUS. Then shall we be, as the <HI>Wings of the Doves covered with Silver, and their Fea∣thers with yellow Gold.</HI> This is the <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Adorning</HI> of Souls, in the <HI>House of</HI> GOD, the <HI>Pillar and Ground of Truth; in that which is not corruptible, and of great Price in his Sight.</HI></P>
<P>This is the <HI>Preparation</HI> of Souls for CHRIST, and for a Place in his <HI>Church,</HI> and for Communion with him: This it is that has <HI>his Heart</HI> and delight, what he loves and seeks in his Worshipers: Cant. i. 15. <HI>Behold thou art fair, my Love, behold thou art fair, and hast Doves Eyes;</HI> "a quick, chaste, sincere and single Affection. Chap. ii. 14. <HI>O my Dove, that art in the Clefts of the Rock, let me see thy Countenance, let me hear thy Voice; for sweet is thy Voice, and thy Countenance comely.</HI> "The afflicted, mourning, persecuted and desponding <HI>Dove,</HI> is nevertheless comely and beloved in the Eyes of CHRST, invited and welcome to him in holy Duties. The Souls <HI>Answer</HI> is that, Psal. lxi. 2. <HI>From the End of the Earth will I cry to thee; lead me to the Rock that is higher
<PB N="14" REF="004490_0012_100D586E90D7DFD8"/>than I! for Thou art a Shelter for me, and a strong Tower from the Enemy! I will abide in thy Tabernacle for ever; I will trust in the Covert of thy Wings.</HI></P>
<P>Such is the <HI>Call,</HI> Command and Invitation of our <HI>Saviour</HI> to us; <Q>Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy-laden, and I will give you Rest!</Q>
<Q>look un∣to me and be ye saved, all the Ends of the Earth! Ho every one that thirsteth come to the Waters, yea come, buy Wine and Milk without Money and with∣out Price. The Spirit and the Bride say come, and let him that is athirst come, and whosoever will let him come, and take of the Waters of Life freely.</Q></P>
<P>And is not <HI>this</HI> the Spirit of Grace in the People of GOD? <Q>I made haste and delayed not! With my Soul have I desired thee in the Night, and with my Spirit within me will I seek thee early. When thou saidst to me, seek ye my Face; my Soul answer'd, Thy Face LORD will I seek.</Q></P>
<P>This instant, earnest Concern and Sollicitude should every one of us be expressing for our own Souls Safety, and the Glory of GOD therein from us! those Souls which GOD has made for Immortality, and form'd for the everlasting Enjoyment of Himself; and for his everlast∣ing Service and Glory! Those Souls which CHRIST has done and suffer'd so much to save! has so dearly <HI>bought with his own Blood;</HI> and is striving by his SPIRIT In the Means of Grace so earnestly to save! —</P>
<P>O why should not every Soul among us be on the <HI>Wing</HI> together, under these Attractions and Drawings of Divine Grace! Why so <HI>few</HI> affected, attracted and con∣verted! why but here and there <HI>one</HI> overcome by the Grace of the <HI>Gospel</HI> fervently preach'd and offer'd to us, from time to time! Why <HI>you</HI> and <HI>you</HI> singly and alone! where are your <HI>Companions?</HI> why are they not <HI>come</HI> with you? your Consorts, Children, Families, Neighbours, Friends, and Acquaintance! Is this any thing like the Appearance of a <HI>Cloud,</HI> or as the <HI>Doves</HI> at their <HI>Windows?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="004490_0013_100D5870DE6EF078"/>
We are in a <HI>Church-Relation</HI> and <HI>Fellowship;</HI> but where's the <HI>Cloud,</HI> with the <HI>Glory of</HI> GOD <HI>in it,</HI> to <HI>fill his Tabernacle</HI> and <HI>Temple?</HI> and for the LORD to <HI>reside in!</HI> Is the <HI>visible Church</HI> his <HI>Dove-house?</HI> but where are the <HI>Doves?</HI> where the <HI>flying in</HI> of many together, or of <HI>all,</HI> apace, one after another! how <HI>few</HI> are on the Wing? where is the <HI>Promise</HI> in the Text, fulfilled in us! Who is flying to the <HI>Blood of</HI> CHRIST <HI>for Cleansing? to the Righteousness of</HI> CHRIST <HI>for the Justification of Life?</HI></P>
<P>My Text would suppose that it were <HI>thus</HI> with us; and then it would lead us to <HI>admire</HI> and <HI>rejoice,</HI> and even triumph in the Thing; —"<HI>Who are These,</HI> says the <HI>Prophet, that fly as a Cloud, and as the Doves?</HI> He ad∣mires the Persons and the Thing! It was lovely in his Eyes! He speaks with Delight and Transport, in a Sur∣prise of Pleasure: He sets his Eye and Heart upon them, as the Excellent and Amiable of the Earth.</P>
<P>It is like other Expressions of Esteem and Joy, Cant. iii. 6. <HI>Who is this that cometh out of the Wilderness like Pillars of Smoak, from Myrrhe and Frankincense inflam'd!</HI> &amp;c. And, <HI>Who is this that looketh forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun,</HI> &amp;c. —</P>
<P N="1">1. How <HI>good and pleasant</HI> would it be, and should it be, to see this <HI>Cloud</HI> rising among us, this <HI>Flock of Doves</HI> on the Wing? — To you that believe CHRIST is pre∣cious, and <HI>Souls</HI> are precious. — A <HI>pleasant</HI> Thing it would be to all good People, to see many more like minded with themselves, in earnest caring for their Souls, and sollicitous for their everlasting Welfare. Their Joy herein would be fulfilled; their Joy in GOD, and their holy Jealousy for him would be removed.</P>
<P>"I have been jealous for the LORD GOD OF HOSTS, said <HI>Elijah,</HI> for I have seen his Courts deserted, his Altar cast down, and I only am left"! Could any thing be more melancholly! — Equally joyous had it been to him to have seen the LORD's Courts <HI>crouded,</HI> and his Altar <HI>laden</HI> with Sacrifices, and his Priests <HI>ministring</HI> about it. — "The King's Honour is the Multitude of his Subjects,
<PB N="16" REF="004490_0014_100D58732F5124D8"/>and the <HI>Numbers</HI> of the Godly are the <HI>Glory of</HI> CHRIST. "Blessed be the Kingdom of our Father <HI>David,</HI> and Hosanna in the highest", may we well cry, when we see the Multitudes strowing themselves in their SAVIOUR's Way! The Friends of the Bridegroom rejoice to hear the Report, John iii. 25. <HI>Rabbi, He of whom thou barest witness, All Men come to him!</HI></P>
<P>'Tis pleasant when we are on a <HI>Journey,</HI> to find very <HI>good Company,</HI> and the more the better sometimes, on the Road. How <HI>dull</HI> and heavy should it be to <HI>travel alone</HI> heavenward, or but with a very few? Society evens and <HI>shortens</HI> the Way, keeps up the Spirits and makes us <HI>lively</HI> and chearful. Company is good in <HI>bad Way</HI> and Weather, and helps over Difficulties. It's pleasant on a Road for Fellow Travellers to <HI>help</HI> each other on, and to be helpt by one another. "<HI>Two are better than one,</HI> says <HI>Solomon</HI> in the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of GOD; Eccle. iv. 9. <HI>For if they fall one will lift up the other; but Wo to him that is alone; for he hath not another to lift him up.</HI> It's good to travel <HI>strong</HI> towards Heaven. We mutually consult our Safety and Comfort by going <HI>many</HI> together. Then we may be like to <HI>sing in the Ways of the</HI> LORD, and his Glory will be greater in and by us. Were we many more than we are, we should be much the more easy, pleasant and happy: more pleas'd in each other, and pro∣fited by one another. Next to the Comfort of Commu∣nion with GOD, is that with his SAINTS, and the one is promoted by the other. CHRIST yet to this Day joins the Company and makes a third, as on the Way to <HI>Em∣maus</HI> where two or three are walking together in the Sorrows or Joys of Religion.</P>
<P>More particularly, How pleasant must it be to your pious <HI>Ministers,</HI> to be instrumental and successful in bring∣ing many Souls to CHRIST, and to serve in building up his Kingdom on Earth? and how grievous must the <HI>Com∣plaint</HI> be from their Hearts and Lips, which yet came from CHRIST's the great Prophet? Isai. xlix. 8. "<HI>Thou art my Servant in whom I will be glorified! then I said, I have laboured in vain, and spent my Strength for nought!
<PB N="17" REF="004490_0015_100D5875FA7178B8"/>yet surely my Work is with the</HI> LORD, <HI>and my Judgment with my</HI> GOD. The compassionate JESUS was more tender of his poor Disciples, He sent them forth with these Words in their Mouth, Luke x. <HI>The Kingdom of</HI> GOD <HI>is come nigh unto you!</HI> And they returned to Him with Joy; LORD <HI>even the Devils are subject to us thro' thy Name!</HI> And He answered, <HI>I beheld Satan as Light∣ning fall from Heaven! and behold I give you Power over all the Power of the Enemy!</HI> — This Manner of En∣trance the Apostles gloried of, after their LORD's Ascen∣tion! "<HI>Ye your selves know it,</HI> (writes blessed St. <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Thessalonians) that our Gospel came not to you in Word only, but in Power and in the</HI> HOLY GHOST.</P>
<P>This saving Efficacy of the Gospel is one of the great Joys of Angels, who behold the Face of their and our HEAVENLY FATHER: doubtless because they see the Pleasures in the Face of GOD on this Account. He has given the benevolent holy <HI>Spirits</HI> this Example and Com∣mandment; "<HI>As I live,</HI> (have they heard the LORD say, and so have <HI>we) I have no Pleasure at all that the Sinner should die.</HI> They also know the Pleasure of the Soul of CHRIST, his Satisfaction in seeing his Seed. He looks on his <HI>Flock of Sheep, that come up from the washing, every one bearing Twins, and not one is barren among them?</HI> Ah! with what Eye and Heart must the <HI>Good Shepherd</HI> see this!— Only his <HI>own Heart</HI> knows the Joy of it; only his own <HI>Mouth most sweet</HI> can speak it. Hell only, and the Children of the Devil, are vext to see Souls gathering to CHRIST! Satan and his may scoff or gnash at it, as they did in CHRIST's Time,— <HI>The World is gone after him!</HI></P>
<P>But we should joy in it, not only for the Sake of particular Souls, and of many Souls; and our own particular Relation to 'em, and Interest in 'em; but also as the high Token of GOD's special Favour and Blessing on a People a Kingdom, a Province, or a City; <Q>This is my Rest for ever (has he said and sworn in Truth, and will not turn from it) here will I dwell, for I have desired it! I will abun∣dantly
<PB N="18" REF="004490_0016_100D58779334CB38"/>bless her Provision, I will satisfy her Poor with Bread! I will clothe her Priests with Salva∣tion, and her Saints shall shout aloud for Joy: there will I make the Horn of <HI>David</HI> to bud, I have ordained a Lamp for mine Anointed.</Q>—When true Converts are numerous, than we may say without vain boasting, <Q>The Temple of the LORD, the Tem∣ple of the LORD, the Temple of the LORD are these, and the HIGHEST Himself shall establish her.</Q>— But alas! When Conversions are <HI>rare</HI> under the preached Gospel, how <HI>sad</HI> is the Token, how dark the <HI>Omen!</HI> The <HI>Glory of the</HI> LORD is withdrawn to the <HI>Threshold of the House!</HI> write on the Door <HI>Icha∣bod, "The Glory is departing!</HI> And <HI>Wo unto them,</HI> saith the LORD, <HI>if I depart from them.</HI>— O the <HI>black Threatning!</HI> six times over repeated by the HOLY GHOST in his inspir'd Word: <Q>Hear ye indeed but understand not, see ye indeed but perceive not; make the Heart of this People fat, and make their Ears heavy, and shut their Eyes; lest they see with their Eyes, hear with their Ears, and understand with their Hearts, and be converted.</Q></P>
<P>Finally, The Pleasure of feeing Souls <HI>flying to</HI> CHRIST rises to its Height, in the Prospect it affords of their Meeting together at his right-Hand. This, says the <HI>Apostle,</HI> is <HI>our Hope and Joy and Crown of Rejoicing! even Ye at the Coming of</HI> CHRIST <HI>with all his Saints? for ye are our Glory and Joy.</HI></P>
<P>Think, Fellow-Christians, how glad you will be to see one another then and there! to see all Tempta∣tion, Sorrow and Danger past for ever! to see the LORD himself glorified and magnified in You together at the great and last Day! to see your selves infinitely blessed in Him! let the Thought and Hope hereof rejoice us now in our Fellowship together in the Gospel.</P>
<P>But then 2. A Word on the <HI>Wonder</HI> and <HI>Admiration</HI> that the Thing calls for; "<HI>Souls flying as a Cloud to</HI> CHRIST <HI>and as the Doves to their Windows.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="004490_0017_100D58792CC8F740"/>
<HI>Who are these?</HI> a <HI>strange</HI> and surprising <HI>Vision!</HI> a vast <HI>Gentile</HI> Church! the MESSIAH King of the many extended Nations! and Abundance of Conversions among People hitherto Strangers to the <HI>true</HI> GOD, and <HI>Aliens from the Covenant of Promise! without</HI> GOD <HI>and Hope in the World.</HI></P>
<P>The Conversion of any <HI>one</HI> Soul is a Thing to be admired. The <HI>Rarity</HI> of the Thing makes it admirable. What a Pity 'tis to give this as a Reason! a true Conversion to GOD is a <HI>singular</HI> Thing in a World ly∣ing in Wickedness: Abundance of Conversions then must be wonderful.</P>
<P>Again, The <HI>Difficulty</HI> of the Thing, and the <HI>Oppo∣sition</HI> made against it, both from within and from with∣out, increases the Wonder. The natural <HI>Enmity</HI> with∣in us to GOD and Godliness; <HI>indwelling Sin,</HI> and an <HI>evil Heart of Unbelief departing from the living</HI> GOD, this makes the <HI>Wonder</HI> in the Conversion of any. But then there are the Powers of Hell, Satan and his Hosts, in League with Flesh and Blood, and a World that is <HI>Enmity to</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>The <HI>Evil One</HI> came and found <HI>nothing in</HI> CHRIST! he comes and finds every evil and filthy Lust in us: "<HI>but be of good Cheer,</HI> has the HOLY ONE OF GOD said, <HI>I have overcome!</HI>— Saints admire his Con∣quest, and their own Salvation. — "<HI>We wrestle</HI> (says the Apostle) <HI>against Flesh and Blood, Principalities and Powers, the Rulers of the Darkness of this World, and spiritual Wickednesses in high Places.</HI></P>
<P>Ah Grace and Power to be admired, and celebrated for ever? when JESUS the <HI>Conqueror</HI> sets the Feet of his victorious <HI>Israelites</HI> on the Necks of these <HI>Powers of Canaan!</HI></P>
<P>But the Excellency of the Power is CHRIST's subdu∣ing the Soul it self; in making a <HI>free and willing People,</HI> which is the <HI>Beauty of Holiness!</HI> For if the SON <HI>make us free we shall be free indeed.</HI> We read therefore of a
<PB N="20" REF="004490_0018_100D587B09960678"/><HI>Translation into the glorious Liberty of the Sons of</HI> GOD! What an admirable Word is that! what a spiritual Em∣pire is this, the <HI>Kingdom of</HI> GOD <HI>within us!</HI> from a Renovation of the Mind and Heart, a new Creature form'd, not only without any Disposition in Nature thereto, but against all possible Indisposition Reluctance and Aversation! This is "the Greatness of his Power us-ward, who believe! which what Soul can know or comprehend; and therefore ever enough admire the Thing in all its Grandeur! The Change which Grace makes in a Soul, overcoming it to a delightful Consent to the whole good Pleasure of GOD. The Surprise of this Effect of Grace, was equal to the <HI>Apostle</HI> and the <HI>Churches</HI> round about! that by a <HI>Light and Word</HI> on the Way, <HI>He</HI> should be changed at once, from a raging Enemy, into a dutiful Disciple! "LORD, <HI>What wilt thou have me to do!</HI> that the furious Persecu∣tor was at once become a zealous Preacher! <HI>and they glorified</HI> GOD <HI>in me.</HI></P>
<P>Admirably <HI>free</HI> and sovereign is this Grace, when, where, how, and by what Means, and to what De∣gree it will work! singling out sometimes the most unworthy, vile, and chief of Sinners! Admirable the <HI>Ease</HI> wherewith the Change is effected, by a <HI>Word,</HI> a <HI>Thought,</HI> an <HI>effectual Conviction!</HI> admirably <HI>sudden and silent</HI> when GOD will, as the Heart of <HI>Lydia</HI> was open'd in attending to <HI>Paul.</HI> Or admirable the Force and Roar of the <HI>Earthquake</HI> which shook the <HI>Jailor</HI> to pieces! Admirable all the <HI>Variety</HI> of Ways wherein GOD pleases to work on one and another!</P>
<P>Admirable is the whole Work of Grace for the <HI>Excellency</HI> thereof. It is all holy, just, and good; glorious in Holiness, the Work is perfect! So admira∣ble the Thing was, to see a <HI>poor Demoniac</HI> at JESUS <HI>Feet in a right Mind!</HI> but how does the Wonder rise to see abundance of like foolish distracted Sinners so re∣stored, and made wise unto Salvation.</P>
<P>But let us follow the <HI>whole Election of Grace</HI> to the Throne of the MOST HIGH for ever and ever!
<PB N="21" REF="004490_0019_100D587E9E74FF40"/>and what a wondrous Sight will they be! <Q>The thou∣sand times ten thousands, and thousands of thousands; the Multitudes which no Man can Number, of all Nations and Kindreds and People and Tongues, clothed with white Robes, and Palms in their Hands!</Q> The <HI>Inquiry</HI> then will be the same as in my <HI>Text</HI> concerning them! <HI>Revel.</HI> vii. 13. <Q>Who are these? and whence came they? — These that have washed their Robes and made them white in the Blood of the LAMB!</Q> — which tho' it be primarily the more particular Character of the <HI>Martyrs</HI> of JESUS, yet is really and in Truth the Honour and Glory of every sincere Convert to Him, and Be∣liever in Him.</P>
<P>Having thus finish'd on the pleasing <HI>Admiration</HI> of Souls flying to CHRIST in Clouds and Flocks; let <HI>Us</HI> now <HI>show</HI> in fact that <HI>we</HI> do truly <HI>admire</HI> it, and have <HI>Pleasure</HI> in it. — Will <HI>we</HI> then be a Part of this lovely, happy, wise, holy, <HI>admirable</HI> Number! Are <HI>we</HI> taken up into this <HI>Cloud!</HI> Are <HI>we</HI> on the <HI>Wing</HI> among the <HI>Doves</HI> of CHRIST? Would we not desire to be of this blessed Number and Character.</P>
<P>Your <HI>Ministers</HI> would lead you in the Way, and go before you! Come, our <HI>dear People,</HI> and fly with us! Descend, O SACRED DOVE! O blessed SPIRIT OF GRACE! and raise and lift us up, and carry us away, <HI>on high</HI> together.</P>
<P>There is <HI>none</HI> of us, no not <HI>one,</HI> Ministers nor People, that can of our selves, in our own Strength, <HI>rise</HI> or <HI>ascend,</HI> no nor so much as <HI>stand or go; impotent</HI> as we are and <HI>diseased at the Pool!</HI> there we must lie, till the Angel of the LORD come down and stir the Waters! Nor can we then put our∣selves in! but JESUS is on the Way, and we ly now in <HI>his</HI> Way, and can look and cry to Him; and at his Word shall leap up and run and not be "weary, walk and fly and not faint.</P>

<P>Go, carry thy <HI>Sins,</HI> and not thy <HI>Penitence</HI> to the LORD JESUS, and cast a poor perishing Soul on sovereign Mercy and free Grace. When he asks thee,
<Q>What wilt thou that I should do unto thee? Answer, LORD save me I perish! LORD that I may receive my Sight? LORD, that I may be made clean and whole of my Plague!</Q></P>
<P>We have admir'd to see how many of you have been of late affected! we shall admire more, wonder and be asham'd and griev'd, if we see your Affections <HI>cool</HI> and go off! if <HI>Sabbaths and Ordinances are neglected</HI> as heretofore, or <HI>formally</HI> attended. If you have <Q>begun in the Spirit, take heed that it end not in the Flesh. Confer not with Flesh and Blood, as blessed <HI>Paul</HI> tells
<PB N="27" REF="004490_0025_100D588C15EBE488"/>us he did <HI>not, when it pleased</HI> CHRIST <HI>to reveal Him∣self in him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>And now to You, <HI>my Brethren that are in</HI> CHRIST JESUS, who have <HI>chosen the</HI> LORD <HI>to serve him,</HI> and have <HI>taken his Yoke</HI> upon you, <HI>easy and light</HI> to your Souls; <Q>let the Joy of the LORD be your Strength; go on your Way rejoicing! He meeteth him that rejoiceth, and worketh Righte∣ousness, them that remember him in his Ways. Lift up the Hands that hang down, strengthen the feeble Knees. Thank GOD, who has wrought all your Works in you and for you, and so far carried you on, kept and recovered you; thank GOD and take Courage. Say, I will never forget thy Precepts, for by them thou hast quickened me, I will run the Way of thy Commandments as thou enlargest my Heart. — The Grace of our LORD JESUS CHRIST be with your Spirits! the Peace of GOD which passes all Understanding, keep your Hearts and Minds thro' CHRIST JESUS, Unto Him be Glory in the Churches for ever and ever. AMEN.</Q></P>
