<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HAT I aim at in this small Tract, is, to be a little useful to Young Gentlemen that are to be introduced into the Knowlege of the Sciences, (to whom they at first appear like a meer Wilderness,) by setting before them a <HI>General View</HI> of the whole <HI>System of Learning,</HI> as it were in Miniature; wherein they may at once behold, not only the Objects, Boundaries, Ends and Uses of each of the Sciences; but at the same time, their Foundation in the nature of things; the natural Order wherein they lie; and their several Relations, Connexions and Dependences, both with respect one to another, and to the General End, <HI>viz.</HI> Our <HI>Happiness,</HI> which is pursued through them all.</P>
<P>This seems to me as useful in the Instruction of young Beginners in the Study of the Sciences, as it is in teaching <HI>Geography,</HI> to exhibit first of all a general Map of the whole Terraqueous Globe, in order to a more particular Description of the several Countries and Kingdoms in the following Maps: And likewise in teaching <HI>Astronomy,</HI> to give first a general Delineation of the whole System of the world, in order to account for the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of the several particular Planets in the following Schemes. — For as in the <HI>Natural World.</HI>
<PB N="ii" REF="005220_0003_1018B1DCC4EEA260"/>
one cannot have a just Notion of any particular Country, without considering it's Situation in relation to the whole Globe, nor of any particular Globe, with∣out considering it's Situation with respect to the whole System: So neither in the <HI>Intellectual World,</HI> (if I may so call it, I can one have a just Notion of any particular Science without considering it as it stands related to the whole System of Learning, and to the general End pursued through the whole. — I have therefore drawn up this <HI>General View of Philosophy</HI> for the use of young Students, that whatever Subject they are upon in the Course of their Studies, they may know to which Science it belongs, and what relation it bears to the whole System; which may, perhaps, be of some use to direct and methodize their Thoughts and enlarge their Minds: And thus to open to them at once a prospect of the whole Compass of their Business, may also engage them to a more earnest and industrious Ap∣plication in the pursuit of their Studies for the accomplishment of it.</P>
<P>Not that I would be understood to think this the proper Order in which the Sciences are to be taught. — There are many obvious Reasons that render it highly Convenient to begin the In∣struction of youth with the <HI>Languages</HI> and the <HI>Ma∣thematics</HI> (which are themselves indeed a kind of Language;) for these are both of them a necessary Furniture in order to the attainment of any conside∣rable Perfection in the other parts of Learning. —
<PB N="iii" REF="005220_0004_1018B1DE46EE2B80"/>
And besides, the <HI>Languages</HI> are best suited to their lively Imaginations, most easily retained by their young Memories, and most obvious to their little Ʋnderstandings: And the <HI>Mathematics</HI> are very useful to inure them to thinking, to possess them of a Habit of close Application, and by that means ripen their Minds to a fixed and strong attention to the Objects about which they are employed. — It is best therefore that they should be long inured to these parts of Learning, before they proceed to the sublimer Studies of <HI>Logic</HI> and <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Moral Philosophy.</HI></P>
<P>And, perhaps it was for this Reason that <HI>Gram∣mar, Oratory, History</HI> and <HI>Poetry</HI> and the <HI>Ma∣thematics</HI> have not been commonly accounted parts of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> but rather Instructions introductory thereunto; namely, because they were chiefly the Studies about which Youth were generally employed among the Ancients <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Quin<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>til,</HI> Li. 1.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 10. &amp; <HI>Plato</HI> De Rep. l. 7. &amp; Epinon.</NOTE>; and accordingly the Term <HI>Philosophy</HI> has been appropriated to <HI>Logic</HI> and <HI>Metaphysics, Physics</HI> and <HI>Astronomy,</HI> and <HI>Pneumatology, Morality</HI> and <HI>Politics</HI> — I thought however it would be most convenient for my present purpose to deduce them from those general <HI>Heads</HI> of <HI>Philosophy</HI> to which they may be referred, and to make them, if not parts, at least Appendages to those parts of <HI>Philosophy</HI> on which they are founded, &amp; with which they have a natural and necessary Connection. For whether they are
<PB N="iv" REF="005220_0005_1018B1E0F6C78388"/>
properly parts of <HI>Philosophy</HI> or not, it is not worth the while to dispute; tho' I believe it was never doubted but that they are accomplishments that are essential to the Character of a complete Philosopher.</P>
<P>However, as I said, It is necessary to begin the Instruction of Youth with the <HI>Languages</HI> and <HI>Ma∣thematics.</HI>— These should all along while they are at the Schools be taught together: The <HI>Lan∣guages</HI> and <HI>Classics</HI> as their Business, and the easiest and plainest things in the <HI>Mathematics</HI> as their Diversion: — And when young Lads have been long exercised at the Schools in the <HI>Latin</HI> and <HI>Greek Languages</HI> and <HI>Classics,</HI> and consequently in the first Rudiments of <HI>Grammar, Oratory, History</HI> and <HI>Poetry,</HI> and likewise of <HI>Arithmetic, Geometry, Music</HI> and <HI>Geography;</HI> (both because these Studies are, as I said, most suitable to their juvenile Capacities, and at the same time necessary to render the other parts of Learning more easy, in∣telligible and delightful;) they may then proceed at the Colleges with the greater Expedition and De∣light, in perfecting themselves in these Studies: (For the <HI>Classics</HI> and <HI>Mathematics</HI> should indeed never be laid aside;) and at the same time go on successively in the several Studies of <HI>Metaphysics, Logic</HI> and <HI>Criticism,</HI> and <HI>Mechanics, Physic</HI> and <HI>Astronomy,</HI> and <HI>Pneunmology, Theology, Ethics</HI> and <HI>Politics,</HI> together with the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> all in the Order wherein they here lie before them.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>General View</HI> OF PHILOSOPHY: OR AN INTRODUCTION to the Study of the ARTS and SCIENCES.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>The INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>PHILOSOPHY is the Study of true Wisdom, or the Study of Truth and Right, in order to the attainment of true Happi∣ness. — Or it may be defined. The pursuit of true Happiness in the Know∣lege of things as being what they really are, and in acting or practising according to that Knowlege.</P>
<P><HI>True Wisdom</HI> consists in discovering the best Ends, and the fittest Means in order to the Attainment of them, and in Vigorously pursuing those best Ends by the fittest Means. — Now the great End
<PB N="2" REF="005220_0007_1018B16264332E70"/>
that above all things concerns us, is, that we he truly <HI>Happy</HI> in the whole of our Nature and Du∣ration; — And our true <HI>Happiness</HI> consists in that Pleasure which attends the Contemplation of all things that come within the Compass of our Know∣lege and especially such as concern us, as being what they really are, and the Regulation or Govern∣ment of all our Actions according thereunto: i. e. according to the Truth of things and the Laws of right Reason founded thereon. — And since this is the great End ultimately pursued through all the <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences,</HI> they must be considered as the means to our true Happiness.</P>
<P>For in order that we may be compleatly happy, it is necessary that all the Powers of our Souls, our <HI>Understandings, Wills</HI> and <HI>Affections,</HI> be united with their proper Objects which are <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good:</HI> And in order to this, that they be duly instructed and directed in all their Exertions, — To accomplish this, therefore, is the whole Business of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> which comprehends the whole System of the <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Sciences.</HI></P>
<P>So that in order the better to understand wherein our true <HI>Happiness</HI> consists, and the means to it, it is necessary to explain what we mean by <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good.</HI> — And in order to this, <HI>Truth</HI> must be distinguished into <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Intellectual,</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> into <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Practical.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Natural Truth,</HI> which might rather be call'd <HI>Real Truth</HI> or the Truth of things, is nothing else but the Reality of their Existence, as being what in fact they are, and so situated and related as to constitute One intire Whole or System, as in fact they do. —
<PB N="3" REF="005220_0008_1018B1E7249E9E58"/>
And <HI>Intellectual Truth</HI> is the Knowlege of things as be∣ing what they really are, their Existence, together with all their Relations, Connexions and Dependencies among themselves and with regard to the Whole.</P>
<P><HI>Natural Good</HI> is either of <HI>Things</HI> or <HI>Persons.</HI> The <HI>Natural Good</HI> of Things is their Fitness or Suita∣bleness to answer their several Ends as they consti∣tute one intire System conspiring to the — Order, Harmony, Beauty and Usefulness of the whole, so as to render it, in the best manner, subservient to the Pleasure and Happiness of the Sensitive and Rational Nature.— The <HI>Natural Good</HI> of <HI>persons</HI> is their Pleasure or Happiness, and the means, whether Things or Actions necessary to promote it. As on the other hand, Pain or Uneasiness with the means that procure it are Natural Evil.</P>
<P>Now in as much as we consist of a twofold <HI>Nature, Sensitive</HI> and <HI>Rational,</HI> each of which have their distinct <HI>pleasures</HI> and <HI>pains,</HI> there must be two sorts of <HI>Good,</HI> viz. <HI>Sensible</HI> and <HI>Rational</HI> or <HI>Spiritual Good.</HI> Those things or Actions which procure and promote the Comfort and Pleasure, or remove the Pain or Un∣easiness of the <HI>Sensitive</HI> or Animal Nature, are it's <HI>Sensible Good;</HI> and those which procure &amp; promote the Pleasure and Happiness or remove the Pains &amp; Miseries of the <HI>Rational</HI> or <HI>Spiritual Nature</HI> are it's <HI>Spiritual Good.</HI></P>
<P>And since we are made for a twofold State, <HI>Tempo∣ral</HI> and <HI>Eternal;</HI> what tends to promote our Well-being and Happiness in this World is a <HI>Temporal Good;</HI>—And what tends to promote our Future and Everlasting Happiness is an <HI>Eternal Good.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="005220_0009_1018B1E98954EE68"/><HI>Practical Good</HI> consists in our chusing &amp; doing what tends to promote our Well being and Happiness.— And this is of two Kinds, correspondent to the fore∣going Heads of <HI>Sensible</HI> &amp; <HI>Spiritual Good,</HI> viz. <HI>Secular</HI> and <HI>Moral.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Secular Good,</HI> (if I may use such a Term) I mean, that which consists in the Practice of those several Arts and Businesses that tend to promote our outward and sensible Wellbeing in this Life, or the temporal Comfort and Pleasure of our Animal and Sensitive Nature.</P>
<P>And <HI>Moral Good</HI> consists in our chusing or refusing, and embracing or rejecting either Things or Actions according as they do or do not tend to make our <HI>Rational</HI> or <HI>Moral</HI> Nature, in the whole ultimately happy, <HI>i. e.</HI> in Time and to all Eternity. — And contrary to this is <HI>Moral Evil.</HI></P>
<P>And <HI>lastly,</HI> These several Kinds of Good, are either <HI>Private</HI> or <HI>Public,</HI> according as they relate either to <HI>one Person</HI> singly considered, or considered in relation to the <HI>whole System,</HI> whether <HI>Moral</HI> or <HI>Political.</HI></P>
<P>From these Distinctions of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> it ap∣pears that our true Happiness consists in both <HI>Con∣templation</HI> and <HI>Practice:</HI> in the <HI>Contemplation</HI> of <HI>Truth,</HI> and in the <HI>practice</HI> of that which is <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Right:</HI> Or which is the same thing, in <HI>Knowlege</HI> and <HI>Virtue:</HI> In the <HI>Knowlege</HI> of all things that come within the Reach of our Understandings as being what they really are, and in always <HI>chusing</HI> and <HI>do∣ing</HI> whatsoever Truth and Right Reason dictate as necessary to be chosen and done in order to our true Happiness, in the whole of o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Nature &amp; Duration, i.e. as comprehending both <HI>Sensible</HI> and <HI>Spiritual,</HI> and both <HI>Private</HI> and <HI>Public</HI> Well being.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="005220_0010_1018B15E028FB748"/>He therefore that is furnished with all Kinds of Knowlege and Vertue, both Private &amp; Public is truly a Philosopher, as being not only happy himself; but also at the same time Qualified in the best manner to do good and deserve well of Mankind. For since to know things as being what they really are, is to con∣sider them in all their Relations as constituting one intire System or Whole; it must follow from what has been said, that it is necessary to the Character o<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Definition of a true Philosopher, That he throughly understands, not only his own Personal Good, but also wherein the Publick Good, or the Good of the Whole consists, (with which his own is indeed in the Nature of things, always connected and co∣incident,) and that in all his Conduct he firmly and steadily adheres to it, and ever acts with a sin∣cere, Zealous and disinterested View at promoting it.</P>
<P>Now there are two <HI>General Heads</HI> to which all Beings or Things that come within the Reach of our Powers may be referred, and which constitute the in∣tire <HI>Great System</HI> of the <HI>Universe,</HI> viz <HI>Bodies</HI> &amp; <HI>Spirits.</HI></P>
<P>By <HI>Bodies</HI> we mean the extended, Solid Beings that we perceive by our Senses, and as such, are meerly passive and inert; i. e. utterly destitute even of the least degree of Perception or Activity. Such are all sensible Things, as consisting of certain fixed Combi∣nations of sensible Qualities, such as Extension, Fi∣gure, Solidity, Motion or Rest, Colours, Sounds, Tastes, Smells, Heat or Cold, Hardness or Softness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In short, Whatsoever we perceive by our Senses.— And the <HI>Whole System</HI> of <HI>Bodies</HI> or Sensible things is what we mean by <HI>Universal Nature,</HI> and is called the Sensible, the Corporeal or <HI>Natural World;</HI> the same being Subsisted, acted and adjusted by an Infinitely Wise and Powerful <HI>Mind.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="005220_0011_1018B1EF7349D260"/>And by <HI>Spirits</HI> are meant such perceiving, intelligent and active Beings as we are conscious we our selves are having the powers of Reflecting, Thinking, Rea∣soning, Understanding, Willing, Loving, Chusing and Acting, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the <HI>whole System</HI> of <HI>Spirits</HI> or Intel∣ligent Beings, as being endowed with Understanding, Counsel, Design and Liberty of Acting, and therefore capable of Moral Agency, and under the Conduct and Moral Government of the DEITY, (the same In∣finite Mind, who is the Supreme Father, King and Lord of all,) is called the Intelligent, Spiritual or <HI>Moral World.</HI> So that the whole of our <HI>Knowlege</HI> and <HI>Activity</HI> relates either to the <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>Moral World,</HI> and the one as fitted to the other.—</P>
<P>But though the Order wherein we at first acquire the Knowlege of things in our Childhood, is to be∣gin with the Notices—of Sensible Objects which make the first Impressions upon us, and then by de∣grees we proceed to reflect, and from what we per∣ceive in Others and are conscious of within our selves, we gain some Notion of spiritual Beings; Yet in order to improve our Selves both in Knowlege and Vertue by the Study of Philosophy; In as much as it is by our Spirits or Minds that we are at all capable of either Contemplation or Practice; and seeing they are liable to Error in Contemplation as well as to irregularity and Viciousness in Practice, (in both which consists our greatest depravity and Misery;) It is therefore necessary that we begin with them: And <HI>first</HI> learn to know and cultivate our Intellectual or <HI>Rational powers,</HI> that we may be under the better Advantage to secure our selves from Error and to find out and know the Truth, whether in Theory or Practice, and wherein our true Good consists — And then we shall be well Qualified to proceed with Success and Delight in the Discovery and Contemplation of
<PB N="7" REF="005220_0012_1018B1F0F62F6620"/>
all the Truths that we are capable of discovering both in the <HI>Natural</HI> &amp; <HI>Moral World,</HI> in the Know∣lege of which consists one great part of our Hap∣piness. — And the Truths which we discover in the Natural World will lead us to many Arts &amp; Practices greatly conducive to the Conveniency and Comfort of our Lives in this present State:— And lastly, The Truths that relate to the Moral World will direct us to our Chief Good; to hate and avoid Vice and love and practise Vertue; i. e. to chuse and act on all Occasions in such a manner as will render us truly and compleatly Happy both here and for ever: This therefore is the Order wherein <HI>Philosophy</HI> proceeds.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>First,</HI> then, we begin with our Selves and learn to know and cultivate our <HI>Understanding</HI> &amp; <HI>Reason,</HI> with which, (we being made for Society,) our <HI>speech</HI> is necessarily connected, that in the right use of these <HI>Rational powers</HI> and Faculties we may, upon every Subject, both in the Natural &amp; Moral World, be enabled the better to discover the Truth and commu∣nicate it one to another. — And this may be called <HI>Rational philosophy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Being thus furnished we go forth &amp; contemplate the <HI>Natural World,</HI> and learn all the Truths that can be discovered and known by us con∣cerning Sensible and Corporeal Things, in the Know∣lege of which consists a great part of our Happiness; especially, since from these we evidently demonstrate the Being, Wisdom, Power and Goodness of GOD who is our chief Good, and in them do most clearly behold Him creating, actuating, providing for, and governing all things: And do moreover learn from them many very useful Arts and Practises greatly conducing to the Comfort of our Lives in this World. And this is called, <HI>Natural philosophy.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="8" REF="005220_0013_1018B1F38337CAA0"/>III. And <HI>lastly,</HI> We return home again to our selves, and contemplate the <HI>Moral World,</HI> and learn all the Truths that we can come to the Knowlege of, relating to Spiritual &amp; Intelligent Beings such as are our own Souls, and those about us, and other Created Spirits, and even GOD himself the Original &amp; Father of all; in the Knowlege of which Truths, another and yet greater part of our Happiness consists: especially seeing from these, we happily discover our true and supreme Good, and deduce the most certain and in∣fallible Rules by which we should be always affected, act and conduct our selves, and in conformity to which we shall be truly and compleatly happy, not only in this World, but also for ever in the World to come▪ And this (in a little larger sense of the word than it has been commonly used in,) may be called <HI>Moral Philosophy.</HI></P>
<P>These are <Q>the three great Provinces of the Intel∣lectual World, <HI>toto Caelo</HI> different &amp; distinct one from another</Q> as Mr. <HI>Locke</HI> justly calls them in his <HI>Hum. Und. Cap. ult.</HI> And after this manner <HI>Plato</HI> was wont to divide his Philosophy, as <HI>Tully</HI> tells us in his <HI>Acad. Quaest.</HI> l. 1 &amp; Tusc Quaest. l. 5. — So that, from what has been said, it is plain, that the whole of our <HI>Happiness,</HI> and consequently the whole of <HI>Philosophy</HI> consists in the Cultivation &amp; Improvement of our <HI>Ra∣tional powers</HI> and Faculties, and in the Contemplation of things as being what they really are, both in the <HI>Natural</HI> &amp; <HI>Moral World:</HI> in reducing to Practice what∣ever we discover to be useful for the Comfort &amp; Con∣veniency of Life; and especially in behaving our selves as it becomes Reasonable &amp; Immortal Creatures and Moral Agents, so Situated &amp; Related as we are and with a View of being everlastingly happy.</P>
<P>O<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this business of the <HI>partition</HI> of the <HI>Sciences,</HI> may perhaps be more distinctly explained after this man∣ner.
<PB N="9" REF="005220_0014_1018B1F79CEC4818"/>
— Our true Perfection and <HI>Happiness</HI> con∣sists in <HI>Acting</HI> according to <HI>Right</HI> for the attainment of true <HI>Good</HI> or what is suitable to our Nature and promotes our Wellbeing in the whole; And in order to this, in <HI>Thinking</HI> according to <HI>Truth,</HI> which is that by which our Actions must be regulated that they may be <HI>right.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>First</HI> therefore, as a necessary means to that great End, we learn the Rules and Means of cultivating &amp; improving our <HI>Rational powers</HI> of <HI>Thinking</HI> &amp; <HI>Speak∣ing,</HI> that we may find the <HI>Truth</HI> our selves, &amp; convey it in the best manner to each other. — And this is <HI>Rational Philosophy.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. And then <HI>secondly,</HI> As that which is the great End to be pursued in all our Inquiries, we learn to exert our <HI>Active powers</HI> according to <HI>Truth</HI> &amp; <HI>Right</HI> for the attainment of true Good &amp; Happiness.— And there are <HI>two sorts</HI> of Good to be attained in order to our complete Happiness, correspondent to the two great Systems above mentioned, (the <HI>Sensible</HI> and <HI>Moral</HI> World, about which our Perceptive and Active Powers are employed,) viz. <HI>Sensible</HI> and <HI>Tem∣poral Good,</HI> and <HI>Moral</HI> or <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Eternal Good.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>I. First.</HI> For the Attainment of <HI>Sensible</HI> and <HI>Tempo∣ral Good</HI> and Happiness, by the practise of those <HI>secular Arts</HI> that relate to the Sensible or <HI>Natural World,</HI> the Knowlege of those Truths that relate to the <HI>Natural World</HI> is necessary: And in this kind of Knowlege and practice consists <HI>Natural Philosophy.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> And, <HI>secondly,</HI> For the attaining of <HI>Moral</HI> and <HI>Political,</HI> and <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Eternal Good</HI> and Happi∣ness, by the practise of those <HI>Moral</HI> and <HI>Political</HI> Arts
<PB N="10" REF="005220_0015_1018B1F91FF10850"/>
that relate to the Spiritual or <HI>Moral World,</HI> the Know∣lege of the Truths that relate to the <HI>Moral World</HI> is necessary: and in this kind of Knowlege and Practice consists <HI>Moral philosophy.</HI></P>
<P>So that <HI>Philosophy</HI> comprehends all the <HI>Disciplines,</HI> (as they are used to be called,) whether <HI>Arts</HI> or <HI>Sciences:</HI> For a <HI>Discipline</HI> in general, is a System of Instructions whereby any Subject upon which we treat is clearly explained, and every thing relating to it is taught in the most instructive manner, whether it be <HI>speculative</HI> or <HI>practical.</HI> —</P>
<P>If it be meerly <HI>Speculative,</HI> the End of which is the Discovery of Truth only, it is called a <HI>Science,</HI> which has usually been defined, <HI>Disciplina Theoretica.</HI> — But if it relates directly to practice or something to be done, it is called an <HI>Art,</HI> which is defined <HI>Disciplina practica.</HI> — Tho' indeed every <HI>System of Instructions,</HI> may be called a <HI>Science,</HI> inasmuch as it consists in the Contemplation and Knowlege of its Subject; and those are properly <HI>Arts,</HI> which are immediately con∣cerned in the regulation of Practice.</P>

<P>To the <HI>first</HI> part of this Science which relates to the <HI>simple Apprehension</HI> of Objects, I refer <HI>Ontology,</HI> or the Doctrine of the general Affections common to all Beings, which has been commonly called <HI>Me∣taphysics</HI> or <HI>Philosophia prima;</HI> For, as I take it, this Doctrine is nothing else but the Definition of certain general Terms, with several necessary Distinctions &amp; Axioms or first Principles, all which being necessary in order to think, speak and reason clearly &amp; distinctly upon any particular Subject to which they are applied; it therefore seems properly to belong to the Subject and End of <HI>Logic:</HI> Whereof the <HI>second</HI> part treats of <HI>Judgments</HI> and the various Kinds of <HI>Propositions</HI> and Degrees of <HI>Assent;</HI> and the <HI>third</HI> of <HI>Reasoning Syllo∣gism</HI> and <HI>Method.</HI> — This Science has also been somtimes called <HI>Dialectic.</HI></P>

<P N="2">II NATURAL PHILOSOPHY instructs us in the Knowlege of the <HI>Natural World,</HI> i. e. the great System of Bodies, or extended solid Beings, and explains the Laws of Nature and the established Connexion of Corporeal or Sensible things, which are called the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> of Nature, and from thence, as I have said, it teaches us many useful Practises, very much conducing to the Benefit and Comfort of our Lives. — So that it is partly <HI>speculative</HI> &amp; partly <HI>practical.</HI> — The <HI>first</HI> teaches us the Knowlege of the Works of Nature, which in Truth are the Works of GOD; and the <HI>second</HI> instructs us in the Knowlege of the Works of men, who being in some measure ac∣quainted with the Laws of Nature, do from them learn to employ themselves on the Works of GOD, for the attaining of certain beneficial Ends, which con∣tribute
<PB N="14" REF="005220_0019_1016E6B166700AC8"/>
to their Sensible and Temporal Good, or the Comfort &amp; Pleasure of their Lives in this World — The Works of <HI>Nature</HI> or rather of the GOD of Na∣ture are called <HI>Natural,</HI> which he has designed &amp; fitted to engage <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> employ the Activity of men; and the Works of <HI>Art</HI> produced by men, (who from the Knowlege of the Laws of Nature, do prescribe Laws to themselves,) are called <HI>Artificial,</HI> by which they secure themselves from things hurtful, and furnish themselves with many Advantages &amp; Accommodati∣ons. — But I shall here only just mention under each Head the chief Arts or Practices founded on the Theory of Nature, not taking Notice of the <HI>Mecha∣nical Arts,</HI> which most of them, depend also on some part of the Knowlege of Nature.</P>
<P>This part of <HI>Philosophy</HI> is moreover called <HI>Somatology</HI> or the Doctrine of <HI>Bodies,</HI> which alone are the proper Objects of it — It is not therefore the Business of this Science to search after, or treat of Efficient Causes. For Bodies being meerly passive &amp; inert, i. e. utterly destitute of any Principle of Force or Activity within themselves, they therefore cannot produce any Effect at all from any Agency of their own; so that one Body cannot be properly said to be the Cause of Motion or of any other Change in another Body. — It therefore belongs to this part of Philosophy, only by diligent Observations &amp; accurate Experiments, to find out the Truth of Sensible Things as they really &amp; in fact are in the Natural World, and by the Help of Mathematical Reasoning to investigate those fixed and established Laws, according to which they are constantly Connected one with another. — And these being thus found and demonstrated here; The next part of Philosophy, viz <HI>Pneumatology</HI> will inquire after the true efficient Cause of all these <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> &amp;

<P>In <HI>Natural philosophy, first</HI> the general Affections of Bodies and their sensible Qualities are treated of in this Order: Quantity, (i. e. Number &amp; Extension,) Figure, Solidity, Density, Rarity &amp; Fluidity, Motion &amp; Rest, Gravity or Attraction &amp; Elasticity; Light and Colours, Sounds, Sapors and Odors, Heat &amp; Cold with the Other Tangible Qualities: And then <HI>se∣condly,</HI> all the various particular Combinations of them, both in <HI>Heaven</HI> &amp; <HI>Earth:</HI> Hence the parts of it are, <HI>Mathematics</HI> &amp; <HI>Mechanics,</HI> and <HI>Physics</HI> &amp; <HI>Astronomy.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The more <HI>General</HI> parts of Natural Philosophy are <HI>Mathematics</HI> and <HI>Mechanics,</HI> which treat of Quantity, Bodies &amp; Motion in general, and are to be applied in the Explication of particular <HI>phaenomena</HI> in <HI>Physics</HI> &amp; <HI>Astronomy.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1) MATHEMATICS explain the Nature &amp; Pro∣perties of <HI>Quantity</HI> in general, both Discrete &amp; Con∣tinued, i e. <HI>Number</HI> &amp; <HI>Magnitude,</HI> &amp; therefore compre∣hends the Arts both of Numbering and Measuring, viz. <HI>Arithmetic</HI> &amp; <HI>Geometry,</HI> with the Arts belonging to them, viz <HI>Algebra, Trigonometry, Geodasie, Stereo∣metry,</HI> and the Doctrine of the <HI>Conic Sections</HI> and <HI>Flu<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cions,</HI> and of the <HI>Sphaere</HI> &amp; <HI>Cylinder.</HI></P>
<P>This Science, as I apprehend, ought to be accounted a part of <HI>Natural philosophy;</HI> because <HI>Extension</HI> &amp; <HI>Fi∣gure</HI> are some of the primary &amp; most obvious Affecti∣ons or Properties of Bodies, and those without the previous Knowlege of which, the rest cannot well be explained Nor can they be explained without con∣ceiving
<PB N="16" REF="005220_0021_1016E6B4CEE71FE0"/>
of Extension as consisting of various parts, and consequently without Numbering: They therefore, with <HI>Number,</HI> seem of right to belong to the Science which treats of the Nature of Bodies, or at least, to be necessary <HI>pracognita</HI> thereto, and ought by all means to be well understood before we proceed to the other parts of <HI>Natural philosophy.</HI> For which Reason, <HI>Plato</HI> is said to have set up this remarkable Admonition over the Door of his <HI>Academy,</HI> OUDEIS AGEO∣METRETOS EISITO. i. e. <HI>Let no body that is Unskilled</HI> in Geometry <HI>enter here.</HI> v. <HI>Diog. Laert.</HI> — It is therefore necessary, as I have said, that Young men be early initiated in the Study of the <HI>Mathema∣tics,</HI> even while they are at School, at the same time that they are learning the Languages and Classics.</P>
<P N="2">(2) MECHANICS explain the Nature &amp; Proper∣ties of Bodies in general, whether at rest or in motion, and investigate and demonstrate the Laws of Nature, according to which any Bodies either rest or are any how moved. — To which purpose this Science treats particularly of a <HI>Vacuum,</HI> and of the Solidity and Divisibility of Bodies, of the Cohesion of their Parts, of Density and Rarity, of Hardness, Softness, Fluidity and Elasticity: And then it treats of Motion and it's Affections, viz. Space, Time and Velocity, and of it's various Kinds or Directions: And lastly of those Forces, (as they are called, on which the several Quantities and Directions of motion depend; such as, Inertia, Percussion, Attraction, Repulsion, Elasticity, and the Resistance of Fluids; for on these depend the chief <HI>phanomena</HI> of Nature both Coelestial and Ter∣restrial. v. Sr. <HI>Isaac Newtons</HI> Principia, especially in his Preface. — To this Head are referred, <HI>Statics, Hydrostatics</HI> and <HI>pneumatics.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="17" REF="005220_0022_1016E6B784BECC48"/>2. The more <HI>special</HI> parts of <HI>Natural Philosophy</HI> are <HI>Physics</HI> and <HI>Astronomy,</HI> wherein the various <HI>Phenomena</HI> in Heaven and Earth are more particularly explained and accounted for.</P>
<P N="1">(1) PHYSICS, (as I here understand the word,) relate only to this Earth with it's Furniture; for which reason, this Science might more properly be called <HI>Geology,</HI> especially since the word <HI>Physics</HI> is frequently takes to signifie the same with <HI>Natural Phylosophy</HI> in general. — But however it be called, this Science treats concerning the other sensible Qua∣lities more peculiar to this our Mansion, or as per∣ceived by us, viz. Light, Colours, Sounds, Sapors, Odours, Heat, Cold, Moisture Dryness, Firmness and Liquidity, &amp;c. and then explains the particular <HI>phae∣nomena</HI> in all the various Tribes of sensible Beings belonging to this Terraqueous Globe with its Atmos∣phere: particularly the Elements with all sorts of Bodies belonging to them, whether Inanimate, as Stones, Minerals, Meteors, &amp;c. or Animate, as Plants or Animals. — To this Head therefore belong a great number of particular Sciences and Arts, such as <HI>Geography</HI> and <HI>Navigation, Optics</HI> and <HI>Music, Lithology, Metallology</HI> and <HI>Meteorology, Agriculture, Gardening</HI> &amp; <HI>Botany,</HI> Anatomy, <HI>Chirurgery, Medicine</HI> and <HI>Chymistry.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2) ASTRONOMY (which may also be called <HI>Cosmography</HI> or <HI>Ouranology</HI>) is that Science wherein (passing off from this Globe of Earth, into the vast and boundless Aether,) we contemplate the System of the Universe, and describe &amp; account for the various <HI>phaenomena</HI> of the Heavens and Stars.— In the <HI>first</HI> or <HI>spherical</HI> part whereof we consider the Heavens as a great Sphere, and the apparent motions of the great Bodies thereof as the measures of Time; to which

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. III. Of</HI> Moral Philosophy.</HEAD>
<P N="3">III. MORAL PHILOSOPHY instructs us in the Knowlege of the Moral World, i. e. the great System of Spirits or intelligent active Beings, and teaches all the Truths that can be known by us concerning rational Creatures and moral Agents, such as are our own Souls and other orders of created Spi∣rits, a<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> also concerning GOD the Almighty Creator Father and Lord of all: from which Truths we find wherein consists our true and chief Good, and learn how to be affected towards every Object, and to chuse act and conduct our selves in every Relation in such a manner as will render us in some good measure happy here, and compleatly and forever happy hereafter.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005220_0024_1016E6BDF47E56D8"/>I thus define <HI>Moral philosophy</HI> in a larger sense than is usual, comprehending under it, not only the Know∣lege of Behaviour or moral practice, which <HI>Tully</HI> de∣fines <HI>Rerum fugiendarum expetendarumque Scientia,</HI> but also the Doctrine of Spirits which truly belongs to it, and is indeed the Foundation of it: for the Knowlege of our Duty and what we must hate and avoid or chuse and embrace in order to Happiness, is so necessarily connected with the Knowlege of the nature of Spirits, that it cannot be understood or ex∣plained without it. v. Woll. Rel. of Nat.</P>
<P>So that there are two parts of <HI>Moral philosophy;</HI> the one <HI>Speculative</HI> the other <HI>Practical;</HI> The <HI>first</HI> teaches all the <HI>Truths</HI> that can be known of the moral World; the <HI>second</HI> from them deduces the <HI>Rules</HI> of our Duty.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Speculative</HI> part of <HI>Moral philosophy,</HI> which is called <HI>PNEUMATOLOGY,</HI> teaches all that we can know concerning Spirits, both those that are <HI>Created</HI> and GOD the <HI>Creator</HI> of them This has been wont, (tho' improperly,) to be treated of as the second part of <HI>Metaphysics.</HI> — And</P>
<P N="1">(1) As to <HI>Created spirits,</HI> we know from our selves, that they are intelligent &amp; active Beings, as having the powers of Perceiving, Imagining &amp; Remembring, of Thinking or Understanding &amp; Willing, and of freely Chusing, Refusing &amp; Acting or Exerting themselves, according as they either love, hate, hope, fear, or are any otherwise affected: For of all there Perceptions and Exertions, Passions or Actions, we are conscious to our selves. — All these Faculties therefore are here particularly explained, and from thence it ap∣pears that Spirits only can properly be said to be Effi∣cient Causes, as having alone an internal Principle of
<PB N="20" REF="005220_0025_1016E6C0A72817F8"/>
Activity or of variously exerting &amp; determining them∣selves according to Design, Counsel or free Choice, &amp; therefore they also alone are capable of moral Agency and moral Government. — Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">[1] This Science treats of the Nature, Powers and Operations of our <HI>Rational Souls,</HI> and of their Immor∣tality and Future State of Existence. And this may be called <HI>PSICHOLOGY.</HI></P>
<P N="2">[2] It inquires as far as we are able concerning the Existence, Nature, Powers and Operations of other perceptive or <HI>Intelligent Active Creatures</HI> besides or Superior to us, whether Good or Evil. And this is called <HI>DAEMONOLOGY.</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2) This Science proceeds, by Analogy from what Powers &amp; Perfections we find in our selves (removing all Defects and Limitations,) to explain what we are capable of Knowing concerning the Being, Na∣ture, Attributes &amp; Operations of GOD, the Supreme, All wise and Almighty Spirit who hath made, pre∣serves and Governs all things, both in the Natural &amp; Moral World; being here discovered to be the im∣mediate Efficient and Author of all the <HI>phaenomena</HI> of Nature, in whose Eternal, All comprehending Mind are the Archetypes of our Ideas, and who is the Great Original and Father of our Spirits, and consequently our chief Good; and our Supreme King and Moral Governor, and therefore infinitely Wise, Just &amp; Be∣nevolent in all his Conduct towards us; to whom we must give an Account of all our Actions, and by whom we shall be most righteously and equitably dealt with hereafter, and be either Rewarded or Pu∣nished, in exact proportion, according as our Behaviour shall be found to have been good or bad in this Life. And this part of <HI>Pneumatology</HI> is called <HI>THEOLOGY.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="21" REF="005220_0026_1016E6C35C115168"/>2. The <HI>Practical part</HI> of <HI>Moral philosophy,</HI> from the Truths discovered concerning GOD &amp; Created Spirits in the <HI>Speculative</HI> part of it, infers the Rules of our Duty &amp; Behaviour, and teaches us so to live and con∣duct our selves upon all Occasions as will render us truly Happy both here and for ever. — And here Mankind must be considered in a twofold Capacity; viz either as a <HI>Moral System</HI> in general, or as subsist∣ing in <HI>particular Society's.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1) That which respects mankind as a <HI>Moral System</HI> in general, is called <HI>ETHICS</HI> or Morality, which is defined, The Art of Living happily by the practice of <HI>Vertue,</HI> which consists in that force and stability of Soul whereby we do firmly persist in chusing &amp; doing whatever Truth &amp; Right Reason dictate as necessary to be chosen &amp; done in order to our true Happiness, in spight of all Temptations to the Contrary.</P>
<P>This I have called <HI>Moral Good,</HI> which is here to be considered, not only as founded in the Truth and Nature of things, but also as being the Will &amp; Law of GOD concerning us, and consequently what we are Obliged to do in Obedience to his Will and from a sense of Duty to him▪ For we are here to consider our selves as a Moral System acting under the Eye of Al∣mighty GOD &amp; Accountable to Him as our Supreme King &amp; Moral Governour, whose Will and Law it therefore is, that we should thus behave our selves, because he would have us happy. For being perfectly Happy himself and Self sufficient to his own Happi∣ness, He could have (no Selfish Views,) no other View in Creating &amp; Governing the Moral World, than that it might be, in the whole, a happy System: — Since therefore He would have us Happy, it must be his Will <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Law that we should conform all our Tem∣pers
<PB N="22" REF="005220_0027_1016E6C607284680"/>
and Behaviour to Truth &amp; Right Reason, because such a Conduct. is, in the Nature of things necessary to our true Happiness.</P>
<P>So that there are two things to be here Considered, viz. The <HI>Criterion</HI> of <HI>Right</HI> &amp; <HI>Wrong,</HI> and the <HI>Obliga∣tion</HI> we are under to practice the One &amp; avoid the Other. — The <HI>Criterion</HI> of <HI>Right</HI> &amp; <HI>Wrong,</HI> is the <HI>Truth</HI> &amp; <HI>Nature</HI> of things or their <HI>Fitness</HI> in the whole to promote our True Happiness. — And the <HI>Obligation</HI> we are under to practice accordingly is two fold, <HI>Internal</HI> &amp; <HI>Natural</HI> or <HI>External</HI> &amp; <HI>Moral.</HI> The <HI>Internal</HI> &amp; <HI>Natural Obligation</HI> we are under to the practice of Vertue is that great Law of our Nature, whereby we are Obliged to seek our own Preservation and Happiness. — And the <HI>External</HI> &amp; <HI>Moral Ob∣ligation</HI> is the Consideration that it is the Will &amp; Law of a Superior to whom we are Accountable. —And this is either <HI>Political</HI> or <HI>Religious</HI> — The <HI>Political Obligation</HI> is the Consideration that it is the Public Will, or the Law of the Society to which we belong. — And the <HI>Religious Obligation,</HI> which is here especially to be regarded, is the Consideration that it is the Will and Law of GOD concerning us, to whom we are Accountable for all our Behaviour.</P>
<P><HI>ETHICS,</HI> therefore, or true <HI>Morality</HI> consists in the Practice of whatsoever is necessary to our Happi∣ness in Obedience to the Will of GOD: And con∣sequently it must prescribe all the Rules of upright and vertuous Behaviour in all the Relations wherein we stand, whether with regard to <HI>GOD,</HI> our <HI>Selves,</HI> or our <HI>Neighbour.</HI></P>
<P N="1">[1] With regard to our <HI>Selves.</HI> That we live answera∣bly to the Dignity of our Rational &amp; Immortal Na∣ture,
<PB N="23" REF="005220_0028_1016E6C8CE221290"/>
by governing our Reason, and our Appetites &amp; Passions, whether Concupiscible or Irascible, according to the Rules of <HI>Prudence, Temperance</HI> &amp; <HI>Fortitude,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P N="2">[2] With respect to <HI>GOD,</HI> our Creator, Preserver and Governour; That we Contemplate &amp; Love Him above all things; Trust in his Infinite Wisdom, Power and Goodness; Resign our Selves intirely to his holy Will &amp; Pleasure; Worship his Adorable Majesty, and Imitate all his Moral Perfections, according to the Precepts of true <HI>Religion</HI> &amp; <HI>Piety.</HI> And</P>
<P N="3">[3] With respect to <HI>our Neighbours;</HI> i. e. Other created Spirits like our selves, all being considered as a System of Rational Creatures, equally related to GOD as our common Father and Lord, and to one another as Brethren and Fellow servants; That we <HI>Love them as our selves,</HI> and render to every one his Due; That we do no wrong to any one, but that we speak the Truth, and do all that is Just and Right and Faithful, and all that is Friendly, Kind and Merciful to every one, as we have opportunity, according to the Laws of <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Charity</HI> in all the various Branches of them. — And in all these consists the highest Perfection &amp; Happiness of the Rational Nature considered as a <HI>Moral System</HI> in general. But,</P>
<P N="2">(2) In as much as Mankind cannot well Subsist in this World, without being United and Compacted into <HI>particular Society's,</HI> nor such Societies without <HI>Government;</HI> On this last Head therefore are founded the <HI>Arts</HI> of <HI>Government,</HI> which provide for the Well-being &amp; Happiness of Mankind both Temporal &amp; Spi∣ritual, considered as Collected into particular Societies; Such as,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="24" REF="005220_0029_1016E6CB804F1230"/>[1] <HI>Families,</HI> which may be called <HI>Natural Society's,</HI> as being founded in Nature, and they are the Origi∣nal &amp; Foundation of all other Societies. And this is called <HI>OECONOMICS.</HI></P>
<P N="2">[2] <HI>Kingdoms</HI> or Civil Governments, which are <HI>Political Societies</HI> as being founded in Compact, re∣specting things Temporal and Spiritual, and this is called <HI>POLITICS,</HI> both <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiastical:</HI> Which, being the <HI>Arts</HI> that provide for the Public Good &amp; Happiness of Mankind in the Whole, with regard both to their Sensible and Temporal, and to their Spiritual &amp; Eternal Interests, do in effect com∣prehend &amp; sum up the whole of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> or at least suppose the Knowlege, of all the other parts of it as finally centering in this. — And the particular Examples and Facts in the Moral World under each of these Heads are related in <HI>Biography,</HI> and <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiastical History.</HI> And thus much for <HI>Moral Philosophy.</HI> —</P>
<P>BUT <HI>lastly,</HI> Because this <HI>last</HI> part of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> (especially the Doctrine of <HI>Spirits</HI> and <HI>Morality</HI>) is of the greatest Importance to us; GOD has there∣fore of his great Goodness, given us, relating to these, a particular and express <HI>Revelation</HI> of his Mind and Will, confirmed by undoubted Miracles, and taught us how we who have by our Sins grievously Offended Him, and fallen below the Original Dignity of our Nature, may again be Restored to his Image and Favour, through the Mediation of his Blessed SON JESUS CHRIST, and by the Assistance of his Holy <HI>SPIRIT.</HI></P>
<P>To this Head therefore belongs the <HI>CHRISTI∣AN PHILOSOPHY,</HI> (as the ancient Fathers

<P>This <HI>DIVINE REVELATION</HI> therefore being given us, not to gratifie our Curiosity, by filling our Heads with meet Speculative Notions, but to make us practically Wise &amp; Good, and to secure to us GOD's Favour in a Method consistent with the Honour &amp; Authority of his Laws and Government, ought to be most humbly, gladly &amp; gratefully Em∣braced, and seriously &amp; diligently made use of as such, for our Instruction and Reformation, on all Occasions and to all Purposes, with regard either to <HI>Faith</HI> or <HI>Practice,</HI> wherein soever GOD is graciously Pleased to hold forth any Light or Assistance to us, in Order that we may be Qualified for, and Intitled to an Interest in his Favour, both in Time and to all Eternity.</P>
