<HEAD>THE <HI>INTRODUCTION:</HI> To be Attentively perused, that so the whole BOOK may have the Good and Great ENDS of it, the more effectually Accom∣plished.</HEAD>
<P N="1">§. 1.<SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE have appeared in the World some <HI>Humane Com∣posures,</HI> which have been so <HI>favoured,</HI> and perhaps <HI>flattered</HI> by Mankind, as to have it asserted concern∣ing them, <HI>That no Mans Reproach could lessen, and no Mans Applause could heighten, the Reputation which belong'd unto them.</HI> The Assertion may be made without Controversy concern∣ing the <HI>Divinely Inspired Book of</HI> PSALMS;
<PB N="ii" REF="001946_0003_0FFCAF23ADC45EA0"/>than which the Church of GOD is enriched with nothing more Glorious, among all its Incomparable Writings.</P>
<P>THE Commendations which the Ancients gave of this <HI>Unparallel'd Book,</HI> are as high, as the <HI>Tongue of Men</HI> can carry them; And the Commendations would not be too high, if the <HI>Tongue of Angels,</HI> who possessed the Writers of this Book, were employ'd for the giving of them. Let <HI>Chrysostom</HI> and <HI>Basil</HI> alone be called in, to declare unto us the sense of all the rest! <HI>Chrysostom,</HI> who calls this wonderful Book, <HI>The Christian Panoply;</HI> And <HI>Basil,</HI> who Styles it, <HI>The Common Treasure of all Good Precepts,</HI> and, <HI>A Compleat Body of Divinity.</HI></P>
<P>THE PSALMS are in the Hebrew, divided into <HI>Five Books,</HI> like those of <HI>Moses;</HI> and so they may be called, <HI>A Second Pentateuch.</HI> Yea, They are a surprizing <HI>Epitome</HI> of all the Bible; For which cause, if we call the Psalter, <HI>A Little Bible,</HI> we shall do no other than what <HI>Luther</HI> did before us. And such are the Excellent Vertues, in the <HI>Leaves</HI> of this <HI>Tree of Life</HI> which our God has granted for the <HI>Healing of the Nations,</HI> that, as <HI>Pro∣clus</HI> of <HI>Constantinople</HI> expresses the matter, <HI>To cure Heaviness, to lay aside trouble some Thoughts and Passions, to ease us of our Cares, and recreate those who are oppressed with any,
<PB N="iii" REF="001946_0004_0FFCAFE0309CABF0"/>sorts of Pains, as well as to move Compunction for Sin, and to stimulate unto Piety,</HI> no Book in the World, is to be compared with it, for such important purposes.</P>
<P>MELANCTHON says very truly, concern∣ing the Book of PSALMS, <HI>That it is the most elegant work extant in the World.</HI> It has indeed performed what <HI>Plato</HI> wish'd for, but what he thought <HI>meer Man</HI> could never come to: <HI>Plato,</HI> who saw there was no way of Instruction so efficacious, as that by <HI>Odes</HI> and <HI>Songs;</HI> but after all concludes, <HI>This must be the work of GOD, or of a Man that shall be full of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>THERE have been profane, foolish, empty Pretenders to Literature, who have had no great Relish for the PSALMS of <HI>David.</HI> But with Men who have had a just sense, a true gust of Things, no Writings in the World have been so Relished, as these matchless Gifts of Heaven unto the Children of Men. So <HI>Mattheus Vegius</HI> coming to himself, made a Declaration, which none who are not besides themselves will wonder at. <HI>Nunc pro</HI> Virgilio, <HI>quem alterum in Terris Deum esse arbitrabar, Nunc</HI> Davidem <HI>fideliorem vatem, colam, suscipiam, amplectar∣que; et ejus mibi carmina, quae tanquam ani∣lia deliramenta sordebant, nunc mira aspergunt animum su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>.</HI></P>

§. 2. THEODORET informs us, The Peo∣ple in his time, were so well acquainted with our PSALMS, that both in City and Coun∣try it was the usual Employment of all Christians, <HI>To Sing them:</HI> And even they who had little Acquantance, with any other Book of the Sacred Scriptures, yet so had the PSALMS by heart, as to recreate them∣selves with Singing them in the <HI>Streets,</HI> and in the <HI>Fields,</HI> as well as in their <HI>Houses.</HI> And Verily, These marvellous Poems, have not by their <HI>Age</HI> lost any thing of their <HI>Spi∣rit,</HI> or their <HI>Goodness.</HI> The Christians in our days, may as well feed and live upon them, and <HI>Eat the Bread of Angels.</HI></P>
<P>THE Truth is, It was no ill Advice of <HI>Je∣rom</HI> unto his Friend, That he would make the <HI>Psalter</HI> his <HI>Vade mecum,</HI> his constant Com∣panion and Counsellor on all occasions. <HI>Christian,</HI> Thou wilt find it so marvellously to answer all the occasions of <HI>Christianity,</HI> that thou wilt commend the prudence of the Ancient <HI>Constantinopolitan,</HI> who being driven out of the City, took no part of his Trea∣sures but <HI>This,</HI> which unto him was, <HI>Pro et prae Divitjis,</HI> preferrible to all perishable Riches.</P>
<P>BEHOLD, A <HI>Prayer-Book</HI> which never had a <HI>Parallel.</HI> And tho' the very <HI>Words</HI> of this Book, may often supply us with the best
<PB N="v" REF="001946_0006_0FFCAF3291B19A20"/><HI>Forms</HI> in the World for our <HI>Prayers,</HI> whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we may have need of such; (which made <HI>Luther</HI> say, <HI>He that Prays a PSALM, shall be made thoroughly warm:</HI>) yet the <HI>principal use</HI> hereof would be, from hence to learn, for what <HI>Things,</HI> and with what <HI>Frames,</HI> we are to make our <HI>Prayers,</HI> and with a <HI>Fuel</HI> from hence, to keep that <HI>Holy Fire</HI> in its operation, <HI>The Spirit of Grace and of Suppli∣cations.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Pardon of Sin</HI> is to be implored, the PSALMS will furnish us, with the most <HI>Pathetical Expressions</HI> imaginable for that Grand Concern.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Graces</HI> of the <HI>New Creature,</HI> and the Dispositions of <HI>Piety</HI> are to be asked for, the PSALMS will not only furnish us with <HI>Petitions</HI> for these <HI>Best of Blessings,</HI> but insensibly draw us in to the <HI>Possession</HI> and <HI>Ex∣ercise</HI> of them.</P>
<P>WHATEVER <HI>Maladies</HI> we find our Minds distempered withal, we may repair to the PSALMS as to a <HI>Dispensatory</HI> fill'd with the noblest <HI>Remedies.</HI></P>
<P>Do our <HI>Invisi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>le Enemies</HI> infest us with grievous <HI>Temptations?</HI> The Weapons and the Outcries we find in the PSALMS, against the vexatious Adversaries, may be as efficaci∣ously as elegantly turned upon them. <HI>Davids</HI> Harp wisely introduced, will cause our <HI>Ene∣mies
<PB N="vi" REF="001946_0007_0FFCAF310FD77B20"/>to turn back,</HI> the <HI>Evil-Spirits</HI> to retire before it.</P>
<P>WHEN we have our heavy <HI>Afflictions</HI> of many sorts lying upon us, what can we do better, than repair to the <HI>Songs,</HI> which <HI>GOD our Maker</HI> has <HI>given for the Night,</HI> in the PSALMS which we now have in our hands? We shall not <HI>perish in our Afflictions,</HI> if we take the <HI>Delights</HI> here provided for us.</P>
<P>FINALLY, If we would be well instructed in the <HI>Mysteries</HI> of the <HI>Great Salvation,</HI> or be well acquainted with the <HI>Prophecies</HI> of what is to be done in the <HI>Latter Days:</HI> Let the PSALMS be well studied. The truest and the highest <HI>Wisdom</HI> is here to be met withal.</P>
<P>AND if in the Prosecution of these De∣signs, we add the method of <HI>Singing,</HI> which is the way to be <HI>filled with the Spirit,</HI> from whence the PSALMS are dictated, Behold, the <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> now put into a Cond<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion for it, that we may <HI>in our Heart make Me∣lody unto the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a Thing to be observed, That <HI>all Nations</HI> make <HI>Singing,</HI> to be one part of the <HI>Worship</HI> which they pay unto their GOD. Thus <HI>All Pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ple walk even every one in the Name of his God;</HI> and thus we CHRISTIANS <HI>will walk in the Name of</HI> CHRIST <HI>who is the Lord our GOD,</HI> and who had directed us thus to do <HI>for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="vii" REF="001946_0008_0FFCAFE3462B77C0"/>
§. 3. OUR Poetry has attempted many Versions of the PSALMS, in such <HI>Numbers</HI> and <HI>Measures,</HI> as might render them capa∣ble of being <HI>Sung,</HI> in those grave <HI>Tunes,</HI> which have been prepared and received for our <HI>Christian Psalmody.</HI> But of all the more than twice Seven Versions which I have seen, it must be affirmed, That they <HI>leave out</HI> a vast heap of those rich things, which the Holy SPIRIT of GOD speaks in the Original He∣brew; and that they <HI>put in</HI> as large an Heap of poor Things, which are intirely <HI>their own.</HI> All this has been meerly for the sake of preserving the <HI>Clink</HI> of the <HI>Rhime:</HI> Which after all, is of small consequence unto a Ge∣nerous <HI>Poem;</HI> and of none at all unto the Melody of <HI>Singing;</HI> But of how little then, in <HI>Singing unto the LORD!</HI> Some famous pieces of Poetry, which this Refining Age has been treated withal, have been offered us in <HI>Blank Verse.</HI> And in <HI>Blank Verse</HI> we now have the Glorious Book of PSALMS presented unto us: The PSALMS fitted unto the <HI>Tunes</HI> commonly used in the Assembles of our <HI>Zion:</HI> But so fitted, that the <HI>Christian Singer</HI> has hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Devotions now supplied, with ALL that the Holy SPIRIT of GOD has dictated, in this Illustrious and Calestial Bestowment upon His Church in the World: and there is NOTHING BE∣SIDES
<PB N="viii" REF="001946_0009_0FFCAF3A6E07A160"/>the pure Dictates of that Holy SPI∣RIT imposed on him. Now, True PIETY, Thou shalt be Judge, whether such a <HI>Di∣vine matter</HI> for thy <HI>Songs</HI> thus disencumbred from every thing that may give them any <HI>Humane Debasements,</HI> be not really to be pre∣ferred before any Compositions thou hast ever yet been entertain'd withal. Doubtless, the more that any are desirous to offer unto the Glorious GOD what is purely <HI>His Own,</HI> and the more concerned that any are to have their <HI>Worship</HI> entirely Regulated and Ani∣mated, by the SPIRIT of GOD, the more agreeable to them, will be such an <HI>Instru∣ment of Devotion,</HI> as is here prepared. Tho' the <HI>Hymns</HI> have not the Triflle of <HI>Rhime,</HI> as a Lace to set them off, yet they are <HI>all Glo∣rio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> within,</HI> which is the thing that <HI>Manly Christianity</HI> has its eye most upon; and in the <HI>Spiritual Songs</HI> thus enjoyed and improved, thou mayst most hope to have the Holy SPI∣RIT of GOD, who indited them <HI>speaking</HI> unto thee, even such Things as <HI>cannot be uttered.</HI></P>
<P>BUT that our <HI>Cantional</HI> may be fur∣nished with a superabundance, and the Faith∣ful be plentifully feasted with <HI>Angels Food,</HI> Behold, an Addition of Passages Collected in Metre, (but still as exactly translated) from some <HI>other parts</HI> of the Sacred Scrip∣tures, to answer the various occasions of Christianity.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="ix" REF="001946_0010_0FFCAF52ED8D02C0"/>
§. 4. FOR the <HI>New Translation</HI> of the PSALMS, which is here endeavoured, an <HI>Appeal</HI> may be with much Assurance made, unto all that are Masters of the <HI>Hebrew Tongue,</HI> whether it be not much more a∣greeable to the <HI>Original,</HI> than the <HI>Old</HI> one, or than any that has yet been offered unto the World. Perhaps there is more Liberty taken here in Translating the <HI>First Verse</HI> of the <HI>Psalter,</HI> than almost any Verse in the whole Book beside. It keeps close to the <HI>Original;</HI> and even when a <HI>word of supply</HI> is introduced, it is usually a needless Comple∣ment unto the <HI>care of exactness,</HI> to distinguish it at all, as we have done, with an <HI>Italica-Character;</HI> for it is really in the Intention and Emphasis of the <HI>Original.</HI> Yea, the just <HI>Laws of Translation</HI> had not been at all vio∣lated, if a much greater Liberty had been taken, for the beating out of the Golden and Massy <HI>Hebrew</HI> into a more <HI>Extended English,</HI> For, it may be observed, if you Translate a <HI>French Book,</HI> suppose, into <HI>English,</HI> you turn it into <HI>English Phrase,</HI> and make not a <HI>French English</HI> of it; For, <HI>If fait froid,</HI> for instance, you do not say, <HI>It makes Cold,</HI> but, <HI>It is Cold,</HI> We have tied our selves to <HI>Hebraism<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> more scrupulously, than there is real occasion for.</P>
<P>BUT Particularly; The Reader will al∣low, JEHOVAH, to be Translated, The ETER∣NAL
<PB N="x" REF="001946_0011_0FFCAF4284918288"/>GOD. It is the truest English of that <HI>Incommunicable Name:</HI> A <HI>Name,</HI> tho' not <HI>Unutterable,</HI> (according to the Jewish Su∣perstition,) yet what should not be <HI>too com∣monly uttered.</HI> And the <HI>French Translation</HI> will here speak a Good Word for ours. And where's the wrong done, if <HI>Elohim</HI> should be Translated, <HI>GOD the Judge?</HI> or, <HI>Adonai,</HI> be Translated, <HI>The GOD on whom I lean,</HI> or, <HI>The GOD from whom is my support?</HI> It is in the Hebrew Term. What if, <HI>Col Haijom,</HI> should be Translated, <HI>All Day, and Every Day?</HI> What if <HI>Gnani,</HI> should be so Translated, as to carry both <HI>Suff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ring</HI> and <HI>Meekness</HI> in it? What if <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>alam</HI> should be Translated, <HI>Who can tell the Term?</HI> 'Tis no more than what is in the <HI>Hebrew.</HI> When Two <HI>English</HI> Words are employ'd for <HI>One Hebrew</HI> Word, we have signifyed it some∣times with an * <HI>Asterisk.</HI> But, Reader, Know, that the <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rew</HI> signifyed <HI>Both:</HI> and since it is not easy to determine, which to take, exclusive of the other, it will not be disagreeable unto the <HI>Glorious Inditer,</HI> that <HI>Both</HI> be considered.</P>
<P>BRIEFLY, Upon any <HI>Difference</HI> in this, from the former and common Translation, if the more Learned Reader will please to Examine the <HI>Original,</HI> there will be no Fear of its being Justified. But then, this Tran∣slation may deserve some Thanks from the
<PB N="xi" REF="001946_0012_0FFCAFE60554D670"/>Religious part of Mankind, for having ten∣dred a plain, clear, fair sense of many Passa∣ges, which have hitherto been so Translated, that People could scarce tell how well to understand them: In which regard, this very <HI>Translation</HI> alone, without any of the <HI>Notes</HI> that wait upon it, may be esteemed a <HI>Com∣mentary.</HI></P>
<P N="5">§. 5. MOST certainly, our Translation of the PSALMS, without the Fetters of <HI>Rhime</HI> upon it, can be justly esteemed no prejudice to the Character of <HI>Poetry</HI> in the perfor∣mance. For indeed, however it is now ap∣propriated, according to the true sense of the Term, to <HI>Rhythme</HI> it self a <HI>Similis Desi∣nentia,</HI> or, a <HI>likeness of sound</HI> in the last Syllables of the Verse, is not essential. Old <HI>Bede</HI> will give you such a Definition of <HI>Rhythme,</HI> and bring other Authorities be∣sides <HI>Austins</HI> for it, that <HI>Scaliger</HI> thereupon holds, all <HI>Verses</HI> wherein Regard is had unto the <HI>Number of Syllables,</HI> to have a claim unto it. Be that as the Criticks on the Term shall please, our <HI>Translation</HI> is all in <HI>Metre;</HI> and really more tied unto <HI>Measure,</HI> than the <HI>Original</HI> appears to have been, by all the Ex∣aminations that have as yet been employ'd upon it. For, however it might be with the Song of <HI>Moses</HI> in <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> and with the
<PB N="xii" REF="001946_0013_0FFCAFE787466D40"/>Book of <HI>Job,</HI> and of the <HI>Proverbs;</HI> My in∣comparable Master <HI>Alsted</HI> allows me to say, That in the PSALMS, <HI>Nullum canticum sit metricis legibus astrictum, sed mera soluta sit cratio, charactere Poetico animuta.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED, that Question, <HI>To what Rules the Poesy of the</HI> Davidic PSALMS <HI>is to be ad∣justed?</HI> has been as vexed a Problem to our <HI>Modern Criticks,</HI> as most that they have med∣dled with. It were endless to reckon up the several <HI>Methods</HI> wherein Learned Men have attempted an Account of the <HI>Hebrew Poesy. Pfeiffer</HI> in his <HI>Dubia Vexota,</HI> has given us a Collection; Among which, that which <HI>Gomarus,</HI> has lit upon, looks as pro∣bable as any: And yet, the Rules invented by that Author, are so very lax, that you may according thereunto imagine, a Verso, in every Line of almost any Author in the World. I am therefore strongly of the Opi∣nion, That the <HI>Poesie</HI> of the Ancient <HI>Hebrews,</HI> knew no <HI>Measure,</HI> but that of the unknown <HI>Music,</HI> wherein it was to be accommodated. Our PSALMS in the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> are not so much <HI>Metrical</HI> as <HI>Musical;</HI> And hence, the very Inscriptions of them sometimes inti∣mate, that there was a sort of <HI>Melody,</HI> unto which they were adapted. It is true, the <HI>Oriental Nations</HI> at this day, have their <HI>Me∣tred Poetry;</HI> But it is of a late Original.
<PB N="xiii" REF="001946_0014_0FFCAF47075712F8"/>However, 'tis very certain, that all the skill in the World, will hardly find the Rules of that <HI>Metred Poetry</HI> observed with any ex∣actness in the Songs of the Sacred Scrip∣tures. There is little value to be set on the Authority, of either <HI>Philo,</HI> or <HI>Josephus,</HI> and and after them, of <HI>Jerom,</HI> who quotes <HI>Ori∣gen</HI> and <HI>Eusebius</HI> for it, when they go to re∣solve the <HI>Hebrew P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esie,</HI> into I know not what, <HI>Lyricks</HI> and <HI>Hexameters.</HI> And there∣fore it may be hoped, that our Version may be released from the <HI>Chime</HI> of a, <HI>Similis De∣sinentia,</HI> without being censured for <HI>Un∣poetical.</HI> The <HI>Sublime Thought,</HI> and the <HI>Di∣vine Flame,</HI> alone is enough, to challenge the Character of <HI>Poetry</HI> for these Holy Compo∣sures. And if any <HI>Beauties</HI> be wanting, 'tis owing to the lowness of the <HI>Language,</HI> where∣into a strict and close <HI>Translation,</HI> is what we are here tied unto.</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. IT is a true Observation, which is made by <HI>Folengius,</HI> in his Commentaries on the PSALMS; <HI>Totius Voluminis PSALMO∣RUM Argumentum CHRISTƲS:</HI> A Glorious CHRIST is the principal Thing appearing in them. It is very certain, That in the PSALMS, the <HI>Person,</HI> the <HI>Natures,</HI> the <HI>Ver∣tues,</HI> the <HI>Humiliation,</HI> the <HI>Exaltation,</HI> the <HI>Ex∣tensive Kingdom,</HI> and the admirable <HI>Glories</HI>
<PB N="xiv" REF="001946_0015_0FFCAFE90DDCC848"/>of the MESSIAH, are every where scattered and glittering, after such a manner, as calls for our Wonderment. <HI>The Gospel according to</HI> DAVID, compared with, <HI>The Gospel ac∣cording to</HI> MATTHEW, affords a wonderful Entertainment. If a <HI>Jew</HI> would but believe the <HI>Songs of Zion,</HI> which once were sung in his <HI>own Land,</HI> he would soon turn a <HI>Christian,</HI> and would his Nation do so, it would not be long, that they should be put upon Singing them in a <HI>Strange Land. Christian,</HI> Dig in these <HI>Mines,</HI> and thou wilt soon be sensible of what thy SAVIOUR has told thee, <HI>Search the Scriptures, for they testify of me.</HI> Yea, Good Old <HI>Hilary</HI> has a Note, That the Book of PSALMS is a Bundle of <HI>Keys,</HI> which will open the Locks of all the other Scriptures. The Word, <HI>Mictam,</HI> is found in the Titles of several PSALMS; and Monsieur <HI>Goussets</HI> Discourse upon it, has very much to demand a Reception for it. The Word signifies, <HI>A Thing that is covered with Gold.</HI> But another Word of the same Letters, does also signify, <HI>A Sanctified Thing.</HI> Our Great SAVIOUR, and His Works, are variously Exhibited, in the <HI>Types,</HI> and so in the <HI>Songs,</HI> of the <HI>Old Testament.</HI> The sense which concerns the <HI>Types,</HI> is a piece of <HI>Canvas,</HI> on which the Holy Spirit has inlaid the <HI>Mystical sense,</HI> which concerns our SAVIOUR, as a <HI>Golden Em∣broidery.</HI>
<PB N="xv" REF="001946_0016_0FFCAF4A891E7CE8"/>If <HI>David</HI> be the <HI>Canvas,</HI> in any of the <HI>Mictams,</HI> the Holy Spirit has inwrought a <HI>Golden Idea</HI> of our SAVIOUR into it, and curiously <HI>Embroidered</HI> it, with some of His Incomparable <HI>Glories.</HI> Verily, There are more <HI>Mictam's</HI> in our <HI>Psalter,</HI> than those which have this Term in the <HI>Titles</HI> of them. <HI>They</HI> are not the only ones, that have His Unutterable <HI>Glories</HI> Exquisitely <HI>Embroidered</HI> in them. The German Divine, who wrote a Treatise, to prove, That there is not a <HI>Chapter</HI> in the Bible, wherein there is not a mention or a notice of our SAVIOUR, might find the <HI>Psalter</HI> to be the easiest part of the Bible for him to work upon. And now, when we discover our SAVIOUR in the PSALMS, we then have indeed the <HI>Quickening Spirit</HI> of them. In that <HI>Light</HI> of GOD, we see the <HI>Light</HI> wherein the true sense of the PSALMS is <HI>made manifest</HI> unto us. We see every thing in a new <HI>Light.</HI> And how <HI>sweet the Light?</HI> What a <HI>pleasant thing, to behold the Sun of Righteousness</HI> darting His Benign Beams upon us, thro' the clear and pure <HI>Glasses,</HI> wherewith His Holy SPIRIT here has furnished us!</P>
<P>BUT, O <HI>Eagle-Eye'd</HI> Believer, when thou art Singing the <HI>Graces,</HI> the <HI>Actions,</HI> the <HI>Sufferings,</HI> and the <HI>Grandeurs</HI> of the RE∣DEEMER, and perhaps coming into <HI>Thoughts</HI>
<PB N="xvi" REF="001946_0017_0FFCB067F63B8798"/>and <HI>Frames,</HI> that have some little Resem∣blance to those, which the <HI>Prophetic Spirit</HI> here assigns to thy REDEEMER, in the Time of His <HI>Working out thy Salvation</HI> for thee, what an <HI>Angelical Dignity</HI> art thou advanc'd unto! What a <HI>Token for Good</HI> hast thou, that thy REDEEMER will one day bring thee to a Confort with Him, in the <HI>Songs</HI> and <HI>Joys</HI> of the Heavenly World!</P>
<P>THE Word, SELAH, Ever now and then occurs in the PSALMS. And now allow me to propose, every SELAH, as an Invita∣tion for thee to make a pause, upon the <HI>Magnificence</HI> of thy SAVIOUR. I will not here make a long Recital, of the various, and very many Interpretations, which the Criticks have left that Word in the dark withal. It shall be enough to say, That in the large, <HI>Thesaurus Philologico-Theologicus</HI> lately Published, there is a Dissertation upon that Word, which would perswade us, That SELAH is a proper Name of the Blessed GOD our SAVIOUR, and that it signifies, <HI>The Magnificent One,</HI> or, <HI>One that is exalted on high.</HI> The Word must not be too much separated from the rest of the Discourse, but it is to be look'd upon as a part of it. It belongs to the Period, and is to be rendred, sometimes in the <HI>Nominative,</HI> sometimes in the <HI>Genitive</HI> Case, and sometimes in other
<PB N="xvii" REF="001946_0018_0FFCAF516A870238"/>Cases; but most commonly in the <HI>Vocative, Christian,</HI> In the PSALMS every where think on thy SAVIOUR. And if a SELAN stop thee, think, before thou go on, <HI>O my SAVIOUR, How Magnificent art thou!</HI> — Indeed, such is the <HI>Fellowship</HI> ever between our SAVI∣OUR and His People, that the condition of the <HI>One</HI> in the PSALMS will not <HI>forbid,</HI> but <HI>invite</HI> us to confider the condition of the <HI>Other.</HI> And therefore, what is now pro∣pounded, about a Contemplation of our SA∣VIOUR, to be a principal stroke of our De∣votions in Singing of the PSALMS, will not supersede the Entertainments which are to be joined with it.</P>
<P N="7">§ 7. THERE is a way of <HI>Reading</HI> the <HI>Scripture,</HI> which is now particularly and pathetically to be demanded for the <HI>Reading</HI> of the <HI>Psalter.</HI> And that is, The <HI>Parismain<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> way;</HI> Or, To Read with an Holy cate, to observe and educe, the <HI>Doctrines of Godliness,</HI> which this Rich <HI>Store-house of Truth</HI> will yield unto them that are seeking after it. Reader, Make a <HI>Pause</HI> upon every <HI>Verse,</HI> and see what <HI>Lessons of Piety</HI> are to be learnt from every Clause. Turn the <HI>Lessons</HI> into <HI>Prayers;</HI> and send the <HI>Prayers</HI> up unto the Heavens: <HI>As Arrows from the hand of a mighty Man,</HI> send them with lively <HI>Ejuculations</HI> up
<PB N="xviii" REF="001946_0019_0FFCB0699139E1B0"/>unto the Heavens. The <HI>Singer</HI> gives him∣self <HI>Time,</HI> to do the part of such a <HI>Reader;</HI> And, Oh, what a <HI>Melody</HI> does he <HI>make unto the Lord!</HI> They who have tried this way of <HI>Reading,</HI> with a <HI>Note</HI> and a <HI>Wish</HI> devoutly formed upon every Verse, have seen cause to Bless a Glorious GOD, for instructing them in this <HI>Method of Communion</HI> with Him, and <HI>Rejoyce</HI> in this <HI>way</HI> of conversing with <HI>His Testimonies,</HI> more than if <HI>all Riches</HI> had been bestowed upon them. <HI>Soul bound for Heaven,</HI> Thy <HI>Psalter</HI> taken into thy hand on such an <HI>Intention,</HI> and with such a <HI>Management,</HI> would be the most serviceable, and the most comfortable, <HI>Instrument of Devotion,</HI> that any thing upon the face of the Earth could afford unto thee.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Zerdusht</HI> (or <HI>Zoroaster</HI>) more than Two and Twenty Hundred Years ago, com∣posed that famous Book, which is to this Day the <HI>Bible</HI> of the <HI>Magians</HI> under the <HI>Mahometan</HI> oppressions in the <HI>Orient,</HI> and which has a great part of the <HI>Davidic Psalms</HI> inserted in it, he put upon it the Title of <HI>Zendavesta,</HI> or, <HI>The Fire-kindler,</HI> as pretending to kindle the <HI>Fire</HI> of <HI>Love to God and Religion,</HI> in the Hearts of the Readers. But with how much more Justice and Glory, may the BOOK, thou now hast in thy Hands, claim such a Title! Nothing upon Earth will more bring
<PB N="xix" REF="001946_0020_0FFCB06BDB1F11C8"/>down the inextinguishable <HI>Fire of GOD</HI> from Heaven into thy Soul, than this BOOK em∣ployed as it ought to be; and as now, if it be not thy own Fault, it is like to be.</P>
<P>To assist the Reader in coming at the vast <HI>Profit</HI> and <HI>Pleasure,</HI> which is to be found in this rare part of the Christian <HI>Asceticks,</HI> every PSALM is here <HI>Satellited</HI> with <HI>Il∣lustrations,</HI> which are not fetched from the <HI>Vulgar Annotations,</HI> (whereof still, Rea∣der, continue thy esteem and thy improve∣ment:) But are the more Fine, Deep, and <HI>Uncommon Thoughts,</HI> which in a course of long Reading &amp; Thinking, have been brought in the way of the Collector. They are <HI>Gol∣den Keys,</HI> to the Immense Treafures of <HI>Truth,</HI> which have not been commonly used: But which will enable the <HI>considerate Reader,</HI> not only to see set in a Bright Light, the Passa∣ges to which they are annexed, but having them in his mind, he will be able to Read very many other Passages, of the Holy Book, with a greater satisfaction of mind, than ever he had before.</P>
<P>THERE had been a vast Addition to this Collection of <HI>Illustrations,</HI> if the dread of imposing a <HI>Great Book</HI> upon the Reader, had not so stinted and stopped the Growth of the Volumn.</P>
<P><PB N="xx" REF="001946_0021_0FFCAF5AF8472678"/>
THERE had been also prepared and pre∣fixed unto every PSALM, a <HI>Short Ac∣count</HI> of the <HI>Scope</HI> which it is aimed at; and such an <HI>Argument</HI> as Dr. <HI>Roberts</HI> in his <HI>Key of the Bible,</HI> has given us. But upon a further consideration, this has been lasd aside; For it was considered, That there are so va∣rious and so glorious Things contained in every PSALM, as render it impossible to give any thing like a <HI>Full Account</HI> of what is intended in it, without requiring much more of Room for it, than the PSALM it self does occupy. Nor has any Essay that was ever yet made this way, done a <HI>Justice</HI> (it may have done a <HI>Damage</HI>) to a BOOK in every Paragraph whereof, there are <HI>all manner of pleasant Fruits, new and old, laid up for the Beloved.</HI> Certainly, To cramp and stint the Thoughts of him that Reads, with confining him to some <HI>Few Things</HI> as the In∣tention of a PSALM, when an <HI>Attentive Reader</HI> will find that the <HI>Argument</HI> which the <HI>Short-sighted Analysis</HI> has offered contains not a <HI>Temb part</HI> of the Illustrious Things, in which the Holy SPIRIT has designed our instruction there: it appears in effect such a wrong to the <HI>Divine Composure,</HI> as our PSALTERIUM did not care to be guilty of. Why should a <HI>Bill of Fare</HI> be brought in, which does not mention one <HI>Temb part</HI> of
<PB N="xxi" REF="001946_0022_0FFCAF5C886BD2A0"/>the Delicacies, which an ordinary Attention will find on a Table that always yields, A <HI>Feast of Fat Things full of Marrow, of Wines on the Lees well refined:</HI> A Table more glo∣rious by far then that of <HI>Ptolomies</HI> in the <HI>Temple?</HI></P>
<P N="8">§. 8. AND <HI>yet I shew unto you a more Ex∣cellent way.</HI> Go on, O People of GOD, in <HI>His Way,</HI> and in the <HI>Path of the Just</HI> which is now becoming plain before you; And pro∣ceed unto the <HI>Reading</HI> of the <HI>Psalter,</HI> and of the <HI>Bible,</HI> in that which we will call, <HI>The Affectu∣ous way,</HI> according to a PROPOSAL which is now to be seriously thought upon.</P>
<P>WE are to consider, That the <HI>Holy Men of GOD,</HI> who wrote the SCRIPTURE, were <HI>moved by His Holy Spirit,</HI> in and for the Writing of it; and the <HI>Spirit of Holiness</HI> at the Time of the Inspiration made suitable <HI>Impressions</HI> on the <HI>Affections</HI> of His Faithful Servants, The Good Men had their <HI>Hearts</HI> Holily, Graciously, Divinely, and suitably <HI>Affected</HI> with the <HI>Matter,</HI> which the Spirit of GOD employ'd their Pens to leave upon, their Parchments. It might not meerly be said of them, as it was of a <HI>Baloom, That the Lord put a Word into his MOUTH.</HI> No, A <HI>David</HI> who has an <HI>Heart after the Heart of</HI> GOD, most certainly had his HEART also Holily affected, with the <HI>Word of GOD,</HI> that
<PB N="xxii" REF="001946_0023_0FFCB06EE689A578"/>came unto him. In the <HI>Written Passages</HI> here under our Contemplation, there will be found <HI>Evident Indications</HI> of such AFFECTIONS working in the minds of the Inspired Wri∣ters; as, A Flaming LOVE towards GOD; and then towards <HI>Men,</HI> for the sake of GOD: LOVE, the <HI>Root</HI> of all <HI>Spiritual Affections.</HI></P>
<P>A Lively FAITH, relying on the <HI>Existence</HI> and <HI>Perfections,</HI> and <HI>Promises,</HI> or <HI>Threatnings</HI> of GOD; and on the <HI>Mediation</HI> of our SAVIOUR.</P>
<P>A Longing DESIRE, after such Blessings as are in the view of a Soul that would <HI>Live unto GOD;</HI> Joined with an HOPE of obtaining them.</P>
<P>A Fervent ZEAL for GOD, and for the cause of His <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and the Enjoyments of His <HI>House</HI> among the Children of Men.</P>
<P>A Mighty HATRED of <HI>Sin;</HI> accompa∣nied with, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Abh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrence</HI> of, and yet a <HI>Com∣passion</HI> for, those who abandon themselves unto it.</P>
<P>A bitter SORROW for <HI>Sin,</HI> and for the Mischiefs and Miseries, which are brought by it, upon them that are guilty of it.</P>
<P>A Noble COURAGE, Resolving upon an Adherence unto GOD in the ways of God∣liness, notwithstanding all <HI>Discouragements.</HI></P>
<P>A Total DESPAIR to find that <HI>Help</HI> in
<PB N="xxiii" REF="001946_0024_0FFCB07135660370"/><HI>Creatures,</HI> which is no where to be found but in their Great <HI>Creator.</HI></P>
<P>A distressing FEAR of the <HI>Judgments,</HI> whereto all Wickedness does expose those who are drawn into it.</P>
<P>A Triumphant JOY in GOD, and in His CHRIST, and in the <HI>Favours,</HI> which He be∣stows upon His People.</P>
<P>A Rapturous ADMIRATION of Him, who is the Glorious <HI>Maker</HI> and <HI>Ruler</HI> of the World, and of His Glories; with a <HI>Magni∣fying of His Work which Men behold.</HI></P>
<P>ALL True PIETY is begun by the Enkin∣dling of these <HI>Affections</HI> in the Soul. It proceeds, it prospers, it improves, as these <HI>Affections</HI> gain strength and vigour there. <HI>O Lord, Ey these things Men live, and in all these things is the Life of my Spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to live!</HI></P>
<P>Now, <HI>Christian,</HI> Discover which of these <HI>Affections</HI> may be most obvious and evident, in the <HI>Sentence,</HI> which may be now under thy consideration: And make a <HI>Pause!</HI>— But <HI>Restless</HI> until thou find the same <HI>Affecti∣ons</HI> beginning to stir in thy own Soul, and marvellously to Harmonize &amp; Symphonize, with what the Holy SPIRIT of GOD raised in His <HI>Amanuensis,</HI> at the moment of His Writing it. Be not <HI>at Rest</HI> until thou feel <HI>thy</HI> Heart-strings quaver, at the Touch upon
<PB N="xxiv" REF="001946_0025_0FFCAF5F8C325468"/>the Heart of the <HI>Sacred Writer,</HI> as being brought into an <HI>Unison</HI> with it, and the <HI>Two Souls</HI> go up in a Flame together.</P>
<P>THE Hints which our Excellent <HI>Matthew Henry</HI> gives in his <HI>Exposition on the PSALMS,</HI> at the close of every Paragraph, what <HI>Affections the Verses of that Paragraph are to be Sung withal,</HI> are a noble Commentary; And every <HI>Holy Heart</HI> who <HI>by reason of use may have senses in Exercise to discern</HI> such things, may add unto it, EASILY do I concur with my Excellent <HI>Franckius,</HI> in allowing, That an <HI>Unregenerat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Mind</HI> is poorly qualified for such an Exer∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se as this. But then I will say, That I Soul pressing after a true <HI>Regeneration,</HI> can∣not readily take a more likely way to ar∣rive unto a Blessed Experience of it, that by waiting upon the Holy SPIRIT of GOD, with <HI>proper Trials,</HI> whether He will not quicken such <HI>Affections</HI> in it, as are to be found no where, but in a Soul <HI>Regenerated,</HI> and Animated and Actuated from Above. <HI>Try,</HI> O Soul wishing for <HI>Quickenings from Heaven, Try,</HI> whether upon observing the Heavenly <HI>Affections,</HI> which are very obser∣vable in the Writers of the <HI>Word</HI> by which we are <HI>Born again,</HI> and upon Attempting with an Eye on Help from <HI>Sovereign Grace,</HI> to express the like <HI>Affections,</HI> in the Salley
<PB N="xxv" REF="001946_0026_0FFCAF7705342740"/>of Devotion towards the Glorious GOD, thou dost not find some <HI>Vital Operations</HI> in thee, that shall be the <HI>Inchoations</HI> of a <HI>Life</HI> that shall never be extinguished. Most certainly; If thou dost become <HI>Affected,</HI> as those <HI>Favourites of Heaven,</HI> whom GOD chose for the Vehicles, and Enkindlers, and Preservers of PIETY in His Church thro' all succeeding Ages, it will be an <HI>Infallible Mark</HI> of GOD upon thee, assuring thee of an Everlasting Mansion <HI>with them</HI> in His <HI>Holy City.</HI> Nor is it possible to propound an <HI>Exercise,</HI> that will more <HI>Prepare</HI> and <HI>Ripen</HI> Men to be <HI>Partakers in the Inheritance</HI> of those Distinguished and Exemplary <HI>Saints;</HI> or <HI>Assure</HI> them, that they shall be <HI>Associated</HI> with these <HI>Angelical Men</HI> in the <HI>Future Blessedness.</HI></P>
<P>BUT, O you who are indeed <HI>Born again,</HI> Be prevailed withal, to make this <HI>Exercise of PIETY</HI> more usual with you. When you would bring your selves into the <HI>Best Frames</HI> that can be wished for, take a short Para∣graph of the <HI>Word by which Men live,</HI> and with humble Addresses to Heaven pertinent unto the occasion, <HI>Consider,</HI> What <HI>Affections of Piety</HI> are plainly discernable in the <HI>Word</HI> now before you: And then, with a Soul Turning to the Lord, assay to utter the <HI>Lan∣guage</HI> of the like <HI>Affections.</HI> Perhaps the
<PB N="xxvi" REF="001946_0027_0FFCAF64A2F6C670"/>CXIX <HI>Psalm,</HI> is as likely a <HI>Portion</HI> for this Purpose as any under Heaven, that the Ex∣periment may be made upon. <HI>Friend,</HI> Ere thou art aware, thou wilt be <HI>caught up into Paradise,</HI> in such and <HI>Exercise.</HI> Thou will <HI>mount up as with the Wings of Eagles.</HI></P>
<P>'Tis true, They that can Examine the <HI>Original Tongues,</HI> have <HI>peculiar Advantoges</HI> for their Discoveries, when this Design is to be prosecuted. But yet out <HI>Translation</HI> affords enough, to <HI>furnish</HI> the <HI>Illiterate Christian,</HI> for This and every <HI>Good Work</HI> And if I <HI>constantly affirm</HI> this, That all the <HI>Gommentators</HI> in the World, are poor Things to interpret the Bible, in comparison of a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Illiterate Christian,</HI> thus coming with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sanctified Soul, to make his <HI>practical Commen∣tary;</HI> I could quote a very Great Person who will not leave me alone, but will affirm, That a <HI>Commentary</HI> made without an <HI>Expe∣rimental Acquaintance,</HI> with such Tempers and Motions, as were in the Minds of the Holy Writers,—<HI>Commentarius sine hac Ad∣miniculo, (pio sacrorum motuum scrut into) conscriptus, est vere</HI> Commentarius, <HI>et Nom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣ne et Omine talis.</HI> i. e. Commentis cerebri <HI>refertus.</HI> Among all the <HI>Hermeneutic In∣struments</HI> for the the opening of the Scripture we may say of this, <HI>There is none like in</HI> And certainly, <HI>a Preacher</HI> of the Gospel, can∣not
<PB N="xxvii" REF="001946_0028_0FFCB07381476868"/>more effectually do the part of a <HI>Work∣man that needs not be ashamed,</HI> than by first of all making sure, that he have those <HI>Affections</HI> in his own <HI>Soul,</HI> which are in the <HI>Text</HI> that he is going to Preach upon. Very Notable is the Direction given by <HI>Spener; Premissis pjis procibus, Affectum Scriptorum sacrorum devota attentione observent, cumqus affectum assumere studeant.</HI> And very un∣doubted the Assertion made by <HI>Luther; Scio suturum, siquis exercitatus in hac re suerit, plura per se inventurum, quam omnes omnium Commentarii eribuere possiut.</HI></P>
<P>Now, <HI>Christian,</HI> Go thy way; Repair to thy <HI>Psalter.</HI> Go this way to work upon it, and say, <HI>That thou hast in thy Hands, the most Glorious Book of Devotions, that ever was in the World!</HI></P>
<P>AND here, Let one Admonition be given <HI>once</HI> for all, which the Devout Singer will <HI>often</HI> have occasion to think upon; and which comes in as a <HI>Retainer</HI> to that <HI>Exercise of Godliness</HI> which is now in prosecution. <HI>Christian,</HI> When thou art in the PSALMS that have <HI>Imprecations upon Adversaries</HI> in them, Let thy Arrows be shot at thy <HI>Interi∣our Advesaries.</HI> Thy <HI>Indwelling Sin,</HI> is an <HI>Antichrist</HI> in thy Soul; and of all <HI>Adversa∣ries</HI> the most worthy to have all the <HI>curses in this Book,</HI> fulminated at it. That <HI>Old Man</HI>
<PB N="xxviii" REF="001946_0029_0FFCAF6A63114F68"/>within thee, is too like the <HI>Violent Man,</HI> the Malicious and Injurious one, which is in the PSALMS complained of. Thy <HI>Lusts</HI> are the <HI>Enemies</HI> that <HI>Roar</HI> and <HI>Blaspheme,</HI> and <HI>Pursue,</HI> and indeed the worst of Enemies. And <HI>Satan</HI> too, with whom these are confederate; he is, the <HI>wicked one;</HI> the <HI>Den'd Lion,</HI> that <HI>lurks to catch the poor.</HI> His <HI>Evil Angels</HI> are the <HI>wick∣ed ones,</HI> who <HI>wait with hopes to ruine thee,</HI> under their molestations, thy Soul is <HI>with Lions,</HI> and <HI>among a fiery Crew.</HI></P>
<P>SING with such Thoughts, and so carry on the <HI>Wars of the Lord.</HI> Thy Successes will be, <HI>Wonderful! Wonderful!</HI></P>
<P N="9">§. 9. THERE is a wonderful Thing to be observed concerning our PSALMS, which has hitherto been too much overlooked by all the <HI>Uninspired Interpreters;</HI> But it is a Thing which our SAVIOUR, and His <HI>Apostles</HI> who have quoted the PSALMS near Fifty Times, have led us into the Apprehension of. This is, That they are full of <HI>Prophecies,</HI> and our <HI>Psalter</HI> is indeed the most <HI>Prophetical Book</HI> in the World.</P>
<P>IT is more particularly, but not without holy <HI>Astonishments</HI>—to be observed, That the Design of the PROPHETIC SPIRIT, in the PSALMS, all along has been to describe the Sufferings of the <HI>Jewish Nation,</HI> as well
<PB N="xxix" REF="001946_0030_0FFCB0751135CEB8"/>as of the <HI>Christian Surregate,</HI> under the Ty∣ranny of <HI>Antichrist;</HI> and foretel the Cha∣racters and Confusions of that <HI>Wicked One,</HI> and of his Followers; and predict the Reco∣very of the <HI>Jewish Nation</HI> from their long Dispersion, and a long Felicity for <HI>them,</HI> and the <HI>Converted Gentiles</HI> associated with them, under the succeeding Reign of the MES∣SIAH; and that Happy state of the <HI>New Earth,</HI> in which, under the Influences of the <HI>New Heavens,</HI> there shall <HI>dwell Righteousness;</HI> and the <HI>Tabernacle of</HI> GOD <HI>shall be with Men, and He shall dwell with them, and they shall be His People, and</HI> GOD <HI>Himself shall be with them, and be their</HI> GOD.</P>
<P>IT may be, The Word which we render, <HI>To the Chief Musician,</HI> but which may be rendred, (and was of Old so,) <HI>For the End,</HI> may be to intimate that the PSALMS are cal∣culated eminently with an Eye to the Things which are to be done, at that which the Bible calls, <HI>The Time of the End.</HI> Indeed <HI>Jerom</HI> long ago found <HI>Antichrist</HI> in the PSALMS; And <HI>Austin</HI> affirm'd, That the PSALMS ought all to be understood, of CHRIST and His Church, and many of them refer to <HI>After Ages.</HI> But we now improve in our Discoveries.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, Upon the PSALMS, as we go along, the <HI>Devout Reader</HI> will find this
<PB N="xxx" REF="001946_0031_0FFCB077E24F9990"/><HI>Key of David</HI> here communicated unto him. And when he becomes a <HI>Devout Singer</HI> too, then like the <HI>Beloved Disciple,</HI> he shall <HI>be carried away in the Spirit into the wilderness,</HI> and be shown <HI>the Judgment of the Great Whore thee sitteth upon many Waters.</HI> He shall also in these Visions of GOD, <HI>see the Holy City, New Jerusalem, coming down from GOD out of Hea∣ven, prepared as a Bride adorned for her Hus∣band.</HI> Very depraved must be that Soul, that has not a relish for such Contempla∣tions, more than for any Earthly Entertain∣ments; and that will not most heartily say, <HI>They're more desirable than Gold, yea, than much solid Gold; than Honey also sweeter much, or dropping Honey-comb.</HI></P>
<P>YEA, and who can tell, but the PSALMS put into the hands of the <HI>Jews,</HI> with so Entertaining a <HI>Commentary</HI> thereupon, may be a powerful and perswasive Engine in <HI>the Arm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of the LORD,</HI> for the Enlightening and Over∣coming of them, to <HI>Look on Him whom they have Pierced!</HI> Were One to single out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> present for a JEW, it should be a <HI>Psalter</HI> with such a <HI>Commentary!</HI> Which no doubt he will consider the more Attentively be∣cause he will find his own <HI>Rabbi's</HI> continu∣ally brought in as Vouchers for it. However It is an agreeable circumstance, to encou∣rage our Hopes, that the <HI>Redemption of Israe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI>
<PB N="xxxi" REF="001946_0032_0FFCAF70E2353F78"/>and the <HI>Time to favour Zion, the set time,</HI> is coming on, in that the condition of the <HI>Jewish Nation</HI> as represented in the PSALMS, is now like to be more confidered by the <HI>Holy Singers</HI> of them, than in the former Ages. When the <HI>Holy Singers</HI> then <HI>begin to Sing and to Praise,</HI> who knows, what <HI>Ambush∣ments</HI> our GOD may set against the Powers of ANTICHRIST, and of MAHOMET; causing them to <HI>destroy one another,</HI> and making way for, <HI>The Glorious Things which are spoken of thee, O Thou City of GOD!</HI></P>
<P N="10">§ 10. IT has been among the Glories of our PSALMS, that wherever the <HI>Kingdom of GOD</HI> has been upon making any New and Great Appearance, the <HI>Singing</HI> of THEM, has been very notably Subservient and In∣strumental unto it. More particularly, It is well-known, That when the Reformation in <HI>France</HI> began, the PSALMS were turned into <HI>French Metre,</HI> and agreeable <HI>Tunes</HI> were set unto them. The <HI>Singing</HI> of THESE charm'd the Souls of Court and City, Town and Countrey. They were Sung in the <HI>Louvre</HI> itself, as well as in the <HI>Protestant Churches:</HI> Ladies, Nobles, Princes, the King himself Sang them. All Ranks of Men practised it; A Gentleman of the Reform∣ed Religion would not Eat a Meal without
<PB N="xxxii" REF="001946_0033_0FFCB4585064DA88"/>it. This One Thing mightily contributed unto the Downfall of <HI>Popery;</HI> which the <HI>Popish Chergy</HI> railing at, they never gave over until the profane and obscene <HI>Odes</HI> of the Pagan Poets, had among many People of Quality thrust out the PSALMS of <HI>David.</HI> And <HI>Juel</HI> writing from <HI>England</HI> unto <HI>Peter Martyr</HI> beyond Sea, 1560, reported, That a <HI>Change</HI> now appeared visibly among the Peo∣ple, but nothing promoted it more, than the In∣viting of People unto the <HI>Singing of PSALMS.</HI> This was begun at one Church in <HI>London,</HI> and quickly spread itself unto the Neigh∣bouring Places; and sometimes at <HI>Pauls</HI> Cross, there would be no less than Sir Thousand People Singing together. Truly, a growing Regard unto the Book of PSALMS, allowing us to say, <HI>The Time of Singing is come, and the voice of the Turtle is heard in the Land,</HI> will be among the hopeful <HI>Signs of the Times,</HI> and give as cause to hope, that it won't be long before it be said, <HI>The Winter is past, and the Rain is over and gone.</HI></P>
<P>DOUBTLESS, <HI>The Day approaches</HI> wherein the <HI>Kingdom of GOD</HI> will appear in brighter displays of it, than the World has ever yet been Enlightened withal. There are certain MAXIMS of PIETY, wherein all Good Men are <HI>United,</HI> whatever <HI>Different Perswasions</HI> they may have in other matters: MAXIMS

<P>But let us away, to our glorious <HI>Messiah</HI> as often as we can!

<HEAD>ILLUSTRATIONS on the LXVIII. PSALM.</HEAD>
<P>LO, The Conression of the <HI>Synagogue,</HI> That the JESUS who was lifted up to Heaven, at His first Coming is her SAVIOUR; even the same who con∣ducted her thro' the Wilderness; and will at last restore her to her Land, and will destroy her Oppressors, and pour out His Holy npirit upon her. She fore-sees the Ruin of <HI>Anti-christ,</HI> and her own return upon it, and the homage that all Nations shall then pay to the <HI>Mes∣siah</HI> her King and her God.</P>
<P N="1">1 Behold the Resurrection of our JESUS from the Grave!—In the Days of <HI>Athanasius,</HI> the Divels in the <HI>Energumens</HI> discovered usually a strange Horror when this Verse was recited.</P>
<P N="4">4 R. <HI>David Kimchi</HI> has a Good Gloss. He <HI>Governs</HI> them as a Man does the <HI>Horse</HI> he <HI>rides</HI> on.</P>
<P N="5">5 Tho' the Lord be so much above the highest Hea∣vens, yet the poorest and meanest persons upon Earth need have no doubt of His Patronage: They may re∣pair to His Fatherly Care and appeal to His Righteous Judgment.</P>
<P N="9">9 Liberal Showers sell on the Dry and Desert places thro' which the chosen People of God were travelling. Add the <HI>Manna</HI> rain'd from Heaven.</P>
<P>But above all think on the Gifts of the <HI>Prophetic Spirit. Munster</HI> accordingly makes the <HI>People</HI> to be meant by the <HI>Land.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11 If we consider here, what was done for the Peo∣ple of God in the First Ages—We know they were so Victorious over their Opposers, that they re∣turned with Songs of Triumph, and were met with Women ready to accompany them in the Praises of GOD. [Exod. XV. 23,] Kings and Generals fled. [Exod. XVII. Num. XXI.] Yea, they fled and left their Spoll. [Num. XXXI. 8, 11. Judges. VIII. 21, 26.
<PB N="169" REF="001946_0206_0FFCB365159ADA70"/>This welcome they gave to their Victorious Country Men. <Q>Tho you endured great Hardship in <HI>Aegypt,</HI> where you loo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t more like <HI>Skullions</HI> then <HI>Souldiers,</HI> you shall hereafter appear most splendid, and the Wings of your Armies shall shine like those of a <HI>Dove.</HI></Q> Their Word was fulfilled at the Entrance into <HI>Canaan;</HI> when by scattering of Kings God appeared most illustrious at <HI>Salmon,</HI> and gave them the Possession of the Country on that side of <HI>Jordan,</HI> as on the other side he subdued the King and Country of <HI>Bashan,</HI> the Hill whereof (which had so many fertile Risings) became the Hill of GOD. But the lofty Mountains must not grow proud of this. For not they but <HI>Zion</HI> had God chosen for His Habitation. The Heathen also must not brag of their many Chariots; for in <HI>Zion</HI> there are Ten Thousand times more, even innumerable Hosts of <HI>An∣gels</HI> attending on the Divine Majesty, who is with them there, as He was upon Mount <HI>Sinai:</HI> So much was declared by God who highly Exalted Himself, in the Astonishing Victories, which thro' their Manistry He gave them over their Enemies; whom they carried Captive and their Spoils with them, to be Distributed among His People. All this is an Emblem of what is done by the <HI>Messiah.</HI> This is the Sum of the <HI>Pa∣trician</HI> Paraphrase.</P>
<P N="13">13 <HI>Potts.</HI>—The IXX render it <HI>Lotts. Hemingius</HI> thinks it an Allusion to the <HI>Decimation</HI> of Rebellious Legions, or of Captivated Enemies, for Destructions, 'Twas called <HI>Sortiri ad Panam,</HI> 'twas done by <HI>Lot;</HI> and is often mentioned by many of the Ancients. q. d. <Q>You have lain in as continual Danger of Death, as poor Soldiers expecting the <HI>Lot of Decimation,</HI> for their Lives. But your <HI>Saviour</HI> obtains an happy <HI>Lot</HI> for you; you fly away like <HI>Doves.</HI></Q></P>

The well-qualifyed Ministers and Publishers of the Gospel, are the <HI>Medals</HI> which our Triumphing Saviour does cast about, that His Church may seize upon them. Yea, But the <HI>Medals</HI> have on them the <HI>Image</HI> of the Princes who disperse them. O Preachers of the Gospel, How much ought you to be affected with this Consideration? There is nothing of so much Consequence unto you, as to have the <HI>Image</HI> of your SAVIOUR very Conspicuous on you.</P>
<P N="20">20 The Original may be rendred, <HI>The Goings forth of Death:</HI> All the several <HI>Ways of Dying,</HI> which are found by the Children of Men are appointed &amp; ordered by God. The LXX render it, <HI>The Passages of Death.</HI> All the several and secret Avenues whereby <HI>Death</HI> invades Mankind, God is the Uncontrollable Disposer of them. After all, in the <HI>Goings from Death</HI> here mentioned, why should not the <HI>Resurrection from the Dead</HI> be refer'd unto?</P>
<P N="24">24 There seems to have been a fierce Captain who had <HI>Shaggy Hair,</HI> which gave him something of a terrible Aspect, here particularly referr'd unto. Why not <HI>Hadadezer?</HI> [2 Sam. VIII. 3.] Notandum. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> signifies, <HI>A long haired Man.</HI></P>
<P N="27">27 <HI>Jerom</HI> and <HI>Theodoret</HI> shall now help us, and let <HI>Lyra</HI> give some very melodious Notes unto us. Let the Amiable <HI>Alting</HI> and the Admirable <HI>Witsius</HI> more distinctly modulate them. The Glorious Ascension of our SAVIOUR unto Heaven is here described unto us. The Praises to be offered on that Occasion are inti∣mated; and those <HI>Tribes</HI> of <HI>Israel</HI> are mentioned, from whence the Persons were to arise, that were to be considerable in Praising of the Lord. The first mentioned is <HI>Little Benjamin.</HI> As <HI>Benjamin</HI> was the Youngest Son of <HI>Jacob,</HI> so our Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> of this Tribe, was the last that was called unto the <HI>Apostleship.</HI> [See 1 Cor. XV. 8, 9, 10.] And if <HI>Littleness</HI> may lead us to a Thought of <HI>Humility,</HI> it was what rendered our

XI. 5, 23.] Then appear the <HI>Princes of Judab,</HI> and their <HI>Council.</HI> The Word <HI>Rigmotham,</HI> is also found no where else. 'Tis by some rendred, <HI>An heap of Stones.</HI> A <HI>Stone</HI> is a Phrase for an <HI>Upholder</HI> and <HI>Preserver.</HI> [Gen.

As they went they Sang, and the Song is recited here.—The Tribes were universally assembled on this occasion. There were not only the Little Tribe of <HI>Benjamin,</HI> from whence came the first King of <HI>Israel;</HI> and Princes of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> the great Support of the Kingdom. There were also, the Princes of the emoter Tribes; Of <HI>Zebulen</HI> and of <HI>Napthali.</HI></P>
<P N="30">30 Some of the Ancients would have this <HI>Wild Beast</HI> be, the Fourth Beast in the <HI>Seventh</HI> of <HI>Daniel.</HI> And R. <HI>Solomon</HI> says, <HI>Fera calami est EsaX.</HI> The same with <HI>Psal.</HI> LXXX. 14. Deep thought is required here.</P>

2 In the <HI>Midrash Tillin,</HI> there is an out-of-the-way Observation, That the Psalmist calls on himself to <HI>Bless the Lord,</HI> no less than <HI>Five Times</HI> over: which answers not only to the <HI>Five Books</HI> of the Law: but also to the <HI>Five Ages</HI> thro' which Man is to pass. <HI>First,</HI> Fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Condition in His Mothers Womb. <HI>Secondly,</HI> His Con∣dition at his Mothers Breast. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> His Condition while passing thro' the Changes of this World. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> His Condition in the presence of GOD after Death, <HI>Fifthly,</HI> His Condition after the Resurrection in the World to come.</P>
<P N="5">5 The Blessings of the <HI>Resurrection from the Dead,</HI> are here celebrated. That Clause, <HI>He redeems thy Life from destruction,</HI> evidently points unto it. Now 'tis one of the Promises, concerning the Blessings of the <HI>Resurrection,</HI> Isa. XL. 31. <HI>They shall mount up with wings as Eagles,</HI> which the Jews admirably ap∣ply to the <HI>Bodies raised from the Dead.</HI> In this Passage which has hitherto been read, <HI>Thy Youth is re∣newed like the Eagles;</HI> there are Two Clauses couched according to the short Hebrew way of expressing things; First; <HI>Thou shalt renew thy Youth;</HI> which <HI>Bochart</HI> proves to be the true Reading; A thing to be done in the best sense imaginable, at the <HI>Resurrection.</HI> And then, <HI>Thou shalt be like the Eagles.</HI> The mar∣vellous Flight and Strength of the <HI>Resurrection-Bo∣dies,</HI> is excellently set forth by that Comparison. The Vulgar Tradition of the <HI>Eagle renewing his Youth</HI> is not countenanced here.</P>
<P N="14">14 By, our <HI>Frame</HI> here, the Jewish Rabbi's under∣stand the <HI>Iatzar Harang,</HI> the <HI>Figmentum malum,</HI> the <HI>Evil Frame,</HI> which we call <HI>Original Sin;</HI> whereof we read, <HI>Gen.</HI> VIII. 21. <HI>The imagination of the Heart of Man is evil from his Youth.</HI> The same which they call, <HI>The Poison of the Old Serpent.</HI> And <HI>The Enemy,</HI> whereof we so often read in the Sacred Oracles.

<P>THE Works of Creation and Providence are here celebrated; and the Destruction of the Wicked, who have corrupted the use of these Works, is de∣nounced.

<P>Dr. <HI>Patrick</HI> thinks, That when <HI>David</HI> was treated by <HI>Nathan,</HI> as he was, about Euilding the <HI>Temple,</HI> he not long after fell into a Contemplation of the Divine Majesty, who having built this great World for His <HI>Temple,</HI> needed none of his Erecting.

<P>MAny Conjectures have been about the meaning of this Title, <HI>A Song of Degrees,</HI> here put upon <HI>fifteen</HI> of the Psalms. <HI>Kimchi</HI> says, They were Sung in the <HI>Ascent</HI> of the Jews from the <HI>Babylonian</HI> Capti∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity. [We have the same Word, <HI>Ezra</HI> VII. 9.] R. <HI>Saadias</HI> will have the Psalms to be Sung in an <HI>higher Note,</HI> or an <HI>higher Place</HI> than ordinary. <HI>Aben-Ezra</HI> thinks. The Term only distinguishes the <HI>Tune,</HI> to which the Psalms were fisted. R. <HI>Obadiah</HI> thinks, The Psalms to be Composed for every <HI>Degree</HI> of Persons. Many think the Psalms to be called thus, because they are Ex∣cellent in the Superlative <HI>Degree.</HI> There are those who fancy them Calculated for the Time, when the Sun went back by the <HI>Degrees</HI> on the Dial, to foretell the <HI>Fifteen Years</HI> of <HI>Hezekiah's</HI> Life.

<P>Some see this occasion for the Psalm. <HI>David</HI> having setled the Ark at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and being at this Time on some Cocasion in the Country, heard the good Peo∣ple there speak one to another, as some of them did unto him, of going to Worship God, at some of the Three Solemn Festivals: This devotion of theirs, as it rejoyced his heart, so probably it moved him to com∣pose the Psalm, for their use at such Times as these.</P>

<P>THe <HI>Prophetic Spirit</HI> here teaches the Jewish Na∣tion <HI>[Oh! would they learn!]</HI> how little able they are to hide themselves from the Judgments of GOD; And now they are to acknowledge GOD as their Maker and their Saviour; and Pray to Him for the Destruction of <HI>Antichrist</HI> and his Abettors.</P>
<P N="9">9 'Tis astonishing to see what Passages there are in <HI>Plato.</HI> [De Leg. l. 10.] agreeable to these of the Psalmist. O <HI>Christian,</HI> the <HI>Light of Nature</HI> will teach thee such things as these.</P>
<P N="14">14 <HI>Galen's</HI> Book, <HI>De Usu Partium,</HI> were a notable Commentary and Illustration on the Text now before us. And when he, who was a Pagan, cries out, <HI>Consi∣dera hic marabilem Creatoris Sapientiam,</HI> shall not we reflect, <HI>What Praises do I, that am a Christian, one to the Glorious GOD, upon the view of every thing that belongs to me!</HI></P>
<P>The Modern Improvements in Anatomy add infinite∣ly to the Occasions. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ellini</HI> would begrutch his Time and Cost and Pains, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> searching out the Astonishing Workmanship, in the several Parts of an Humane Body, if it were only to discover a Work of <HI>meer Chance,</HI> or of one who were not infinitely Wise and Good and Glorious. No, he <HI>does</HI> (as every just Contemplator <HI>must</HI>) find himself compelled into the Admiration of a Glorious GOD, and thrown into those Transports and Raptures and Flames, which extort these Exclamations from him, <HI>Magnus Dominus! Magnus Fabricator Ho∣minum Deus! Magnus atque admirabilis. Conditor rerum Deus, Quam magnus es!</HI> O Thou Maker of Man, How Great and Glorious are Thou!</P>
<P N="16">16 Is not the <HI>Mystical Body</HI> of our SAVIOUR prin∣cipally intended? The <HI>Substance</HI> of the Church, whereof it was to be <HI>formed,</HI> was under the Eye of GOD, as proposed in the Decree of <HI>Election;</HI> yet

Thus our Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> Glosseth it.</P>
<P N="17">17 The Vulgar Latin, and the LXX read it, <HI>How Precious cre thy Friends to me!</HI> The Hebrew may indeed be very well translated so. And the Translation agrees very well, with what is just before said, about the Members of our SAVIOUR, all which are the <HI>Friends</HI> of GOD. It suits also very well, with what follows about the <HI>Enemies</HI> of GOD; whom the Psal∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st professes an <HI>Hatred</HI> of.</P>
<P N="22">22 <HI>A Perfect Hatred.</HI> What is that? <HI>Gregory</HI> M. in his <HI>Pastoralis Cura,</HI> has a singular Gloss upon it; It is to <HI>Love</HI> the <HI>Creature</HI> and <HI>Hate</HI> the <HI>Sinner:</HI> To <HI>Love</HI> what he <HI>is,</HI> and <HI>Hate</HI> what he <HI>does.</HI> — <HI>Quod facti sunt diligore, et quod Faciunt increpare.</HI> He adds an Observation, <HI>Propheta tantus boo velut in Hostiam Deo obtulit, quod contra se pro Domino Pravorum in micitias Excitavit.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24 <HI>Kimchi's</HI> Exposition is very odd; That the <HI>Way Everlasting</HI> is a Periphrasis of <HI>Death.</HI> [See 1 Kin. II. 1, and Josh.

<HEAD>ILLUSTRATIONS on the CL. PSALM.</HEAD>
<P>THe Psalm relates to the Reign of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> when <HI>every thing that hath Breath</HI> will <HI>Praise the Lord. Maimonides</HI> gives us a Jewish Tradition, That when the People brought up their <HI>First Fruits,</HI> to present them unto the Lord, according to the XXVI. of <HI>Deuteronomy,</HI> as soon as they came to the Mountain of the Temple, every one took his Basker into his hand, and Sang this whole <HI>Psalm;</HI> till they came to the Courts of the House of the Lord: And then the <HI>Le∣vites</HI> met them, Singing, the XXX Psalm.</P>
<P N="1">1 Of Old they read it, <HI>Laudate Deum in Sanctis ejus.</HI> And their Glose was; 'Tis done, <HI>Quando corum imi∣tamur
<PB N="409" REF="001946_0446_0FFE5A23E3E69CE0"/>Exempla, sequimur Monit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Regulam obtine∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us. Aben-Ezra</HI> observes, we have no way left now, to know, what these Musicial Instruments were; There being many found in the Country of the <HI>Ishmaelites,</HI> (or Mahometans) which are not among the Men of <HI>Edom,</HI> (or <HI>Christians.</HI>)</P>
<P>It may not be amiss here to mention, what Monsieur <HI>Jurieu</HI> has observed.</P>
<P>There are Three Sorts of <HI>Instruments</HI> frequently mentioned in the <HI>Psalms;</HI> The <HI>Cymbals,</HI> the <HI>Psalie∣rys,</HI> and the <HI>Harps.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Cymbals</HI> were large and broad pieces of Brass bent, and giving a strong sound; which were beaten very near in such a manner, as we now beat our <HI>Drums;</HI> and are known by the Name of <HI>Tymbals</HI> in our Days. Our Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in a famous Text alludes unto them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Psalterys</HI> were <HI>Violins,</HI> on which they play'd. with a Bow, Ten Strings belong'd unto it; and the seve∣ral Notes were managed with the Bow and the touch, as tis done on the <HI>Violins</HI> in our days.</P>
<P>The <HI>Harps,</HI> had Twelve Notes, and every Note had its own String, which was managed with the Fingers, and could not be altered by the different way of touching.</P>
<P>The <HI>Levites</HI> were the only Persons that were to play on these Instruments. Indeed we read of <HI>David,</HI> and all the House of <HI>Israel,</HI> playing on Instruments, at the Transportation of the Ark. But Monsieur <HI>Jurieu</HI> thinks, this might be one of the Irregularities which oc∣casioned the Death <HI>Unzah.</HI> At least it may be suppos∣ed, that this was not allowed of, Except in the Coun∣trey and in private Houses. But in the <HI>Temple,</HI> no body durst play on Instruments, unless he were a <HI>Levite,</HI> or the Son of a <HI>Levite.</HI> We say, the Son of a <HI>Levite,</HI> because the <HI>Rabbi's</HI> tell us, that such of the Levites as were Singers, did use to bring their Sons along with them, into the Court of the Priest, tho they were not come to their Full Age required unto the performance
<PB N="410" REF="001946_0447_0FFE51C5484DB798"/>of any Service there on their own bohalf. There is ano∣ther Tradition of the <HI>Rabbi's,</HI> That is was allowable to make choice of <HI>Singers</HI> from among the People of <HI>Israel,</HI> provided they were by Marriage near akin to the <HI>Sacerdotal Race.</HI></P>
<P>But, O <HI>Sincere Christians, Lifted up to Heaven!</HI> You all are <HI>Priests of God:</HI> And of the Tribe, who may and shall <HI>Sing</HI> His Praises. His <HI>Graces</HI> in your Souls, will be the Glorious Instruments wherewith you shall perform the Noble Exercise.</P>
<P N="6">6 The <HI>Bereschith Rabba</HI> carries it, as if every Breath of a good Man should Praise the Lord; There should be a Praise of God in every Breath of such a Man. In the strict Sense of it, this is not attainable by any Man Breathing in this Evil World. However to be Breath∣ing after as much of this Attainment as can be come at, becomes a Christian.</P>
