<P><HI>Of the</HI> CANYINGOES <HI>or</HI> MOHOCKS <HI>none came.</HI></P>
<P>By the Interpreter's Advice, they were first spoke to in their own Way, with three small Strings of <HI>Wampum</HI> in Hand, one of which was delivered on each of the following Articles.</P>
<P><HI>Our Friends and Brethren,</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>You are come a great way, and have doubtless suffered many Hardships in so long a Journey; but now you are with your Brethren and true Friends, who have long been in Friendship and Alliance with your Nations; you must therefore put a∣way all Grief and Uneasiness, and brighten your Eyes, that we may see and be chearful with each other.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>We desire that as we are now met as Brethren and Friends, you will open your Hearts, as we shall open our Hearts, that we may speak with Freedom and Openness to each other.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>You are come to us as your true Friends, we receive you with Gladness, you shall shelter yourselves under our Covering, and be entertained by us as ourselves, for you are our Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>The Indians hereupon expressed their Satisfaction with Sounds peculiar to themselves on such Occasions; and then their Speaker with three like Strings in his Hand, repeated all those three several Articles more at large, returning their Thanks for each, delivering a String as each Article was spoke to, and giving Assurances of their Freedom and Openness, and desi∣ring that we would use the same; but on the 3d they said, <HI>They could not re∣ceive and treat us as we did them, they are now with us, they give themselves up to us, and depend on our Protection.</HI></P>
<P>Then with five more very short Strings in his Hand, the Speaker pro∣ceeded to say on the first, <HI>That they had received on the Road a Message from as delivered by</HI> Conrad Wyser, <HI>welcoming them into the Country.</HI> On the 2d, <HI>That they had at the same time received from us an Account of our late Gover∣nor's Death, but that this would not occasion any Alteration, because</HI> W. PENN'S <HI>own Son is here, and also</HI> James Logan, <HI>with the Council.</HI> On the 3d They returned their Thanks, and with the other two confirm'd the whole.</P>
<P>They said, <HI>They were now come, after a full Consultation with all their Chiefs at their great Fire or Place of Counsel, to return an Answer to the Treaty, that some of them had held with us four Years since, at</HI> Philadelphia: <HI>That they intended to stay with their Friend</HI> James Logan <HI>two Nights to rest themselves, and then proceed to the Fire kept for them at</HI> Philadelphia; <HI>where after two Nights more, they would at that Fire give their full Answer.</HI></P>
<P>They were told, <HI>We were willing to keep them here in the Country the longer, because many People in</HI> Philadelphia <HI>had been sickly, and now the</HI> Small Pox <HI>are there, a Disease that has often proved fatal to the Indians; that it would be a</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="004146_0004_1003DC2CD3473DE0"/><HI>great Trouble to us to see any of them taken with that Distemper, after they had travelled so far to visit us; for we are very desirous they should all return safe, and as healthy as they came to us: That it is proper they should give their Answer at</HI> Philadelphia, <HI>in the same publick Manner we had last treated with them; but it is adviseable they should spend no more of their time in the Town, than will be ab∣solutely necessary, for many Inconveniences may attend it.</HI></P>
<P>They appeared concerned at this, thanked us, and said they would go to∣gether by themselves to advise on it.</P>

<HEAD><HI>September</HI> 29.</HEAD>
<P>The Gentlemen of the Council having gone home last night to <HI>Philadel∣phia,</HI> and only the Proprietor staying, Mr <HI>Preston</HI> with some others came a∣gain to day; and the <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs after they had consulted this Morning a∣mongst themselves, meeting the Proprietor, &amp;c. in Council, said,</P>
<P><HI>That they were much obliged to us for the Care we took of them; we shewed by it our true Friendship for them. That as they are now with us, they put them¦selves wholly under our Direction, and tho'</HI> Philadelphia <HI>is the Place where their Fire is kept for them, yet it may upon Occasion be brought out hither; and they are free either to proceed to</HI> Philadelphia <HI>to treat at the Fire there, or to stay here, as we shall think fit to order it.</HI></P>
<P>They were told, <HI>As the last Treaty with them was held in Publick at</HI> Phila∣delphia, <HI>it would be necessary they should there give their Answer; That we were not wholly against their going to Town, but thought ourselves obliged to acquaint them with the Danger; yet that this is not at present so great that it should wholly prevent their going. The Distemper is as yet but young and just begun in the Place; that it is only in the Heart or near the Middle of the Town; that they will be accommodated at the Edge or Out-Skirts of the Town, where if they take Care, they may for a few Days be in but very little or no Danger.</HI></P>
<P>They then resolved to set out for <HI>Philadelphia</HI> the next Day; and accord∣ingly having been entertained at <HI>Stenton</HI> three Nights, they went to Town on the last of <HI>September;</HI> and having rested the first of <HI>October,</HI> on the second Day they met as follows.</P>

Present also The <HI>MAYOR</HI> and <HI>Recorder</HI> of the City, With divers Gentlemen, and a very large Audience that filled the House and its Galleries.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs being come and seated,</P>
<P>The President, before proceeding to hear them, thought proper to inform the Audience, that in <HI>August</HI> 1732, a great Treaty having been held in this Place with several Chiefs of the Six Nations, they had made report thereof on their Return to their Great Council, where the several Proposi∣tions that had been made to them on the Part of this Government, had been fully considered; and that these Chiefs now present, of whom there never at any time before had been so great a Number met in this Province, were now come to return their Answer.</P>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> being made acquainted with what the President had said, were told, that we were ready to hear them.</P>
<P>Whereupon <HI>Kanickhungo</HI> their Speaker, addressing himself to their Bro∣ther <HI>ONAS</HI> (which signifies <HI>PENN</HI>) to their Brother <HI>JAMES LO∣GAN,</HI> and the Gentlemen of the Council, spoke as follows by <HI>Conrad Wy∣ser</HI> the Interpreter;</P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<Q><P>WE are now come down from the Towns of our several Nations, to give our Answer to the great Treaty, which we and you held together, at this Place, about four Years since: This An∣swer has been agreed and concluded upon by our great Council, who have carefully considered all that passed between you and us, and ex∣pressed their great Satisfaction in the friendly and good Dispositions of you our Brethren, towards all the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six Nations;</HI> and as you received us kindly, and at that Treaty undertook to provide and keep for us a Fire in this great City, we are now come to warm ourselves thereat, and we desire and hope it will ever continue bright and burning to the End of the World.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Hereupon be laid down a large Belt of white</HI> Wampum <HI>of eleven Rows, with four black St.</HI> George's <HI>Crosses in it; and proceeding, said</HI></P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<Q><P>SOON after our Brother <HI>ONAS,</HI> who is now here, came into this Country, he and we treated together; he opened and cleared the Road between this Place and our Nations, which was very much to our good Liking, and it gave us great Pleasure. We now desire that this Road, for the mutual Accommodation and Conveniency of you and us who Travel therein to see each other, may be kept clear and open, free from all Stops or Incumbrances, and if, since the time that we last cleared it with you, any Tree has fallen across it, or if it is any way stopt up, of which however we know nothing, we are now willing to open and clear the same from every Interruption; and it is our hearty Desire that it may so continue, while the Earth endureth.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Hereupon he presented a Bundle of Skins in the Hair, and went on;</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004146_0006_1003DC3D5E917080"/>
<HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<Q><P>ONE of the chief Articles of our late Treaty together, was the brightning of the Chain of Friendship between us, and the preserving it free from all Rust and Spots; and that this Chain was not only be∣tween this Government and us, but between all the <HI>English</HI> Govern∣ments and all the <HI>Indians.</HI> We now assure you our Brethren, that it is our earnest Desire this Chain should continue, and be strengthned be∣tween all the <HI>English</HI> and all our Nations, and likewise the <HI>Delawares, Canays,</HI> and the <HI>Indians</HI> living on <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> and all the other <HI>Indi∣ans</HI> who now are in League and Friendship with the <HI>Six Nations;</HI> in Be∣half of all whom, and as a lasting Confirmation of this great Article, to endure until this Earth passeth away and is no more seen, we now de∣liver you this Beaver Coat.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Here he laid down a large Beaver Coat.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Proprietor gave them Thanks in Behalf of this Government for what they had spoke touching these three important Articles of the Fire, Road and Chain of Friendship, and told them their Discourse thereon was very satisfactory.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Speaker proceeded and said;</HI></P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<Q><P>TO conclude all that we have now said, it is our Desire that we and you should be as of one Heart, one Mind, and one Body, thus be∣coming one People, entertaining a mutual Love and Regard for each other, to be preserved firm and entire, not only between you and us, but between your Children, and our Children, to all succeeding Ge∣nerations.</P>
<P>We who are now here, are old Men, who have the Direction of Affairs in our own Nations; and as we are old, it may be thought that the Me∣mory of these things may be lost with us, who have not, like you, the Art of preserving it by committing all Transactions to Writing: We ne∣vertheless have Methods of transmitting from Father to Son, an Ac∣count of all these Things, whereby you will find the Remembrance of them is faithfully preserved, and our succeeding Generations are made acquainted with what has passed, that it may not be forgot as long as the Earth remains.</P></Q>
<P>They were told, <HI>That it was very agreeable to us to know that they took such effectual Care in this Point.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Then proceeding he said;</HI></P>
<P><HI>BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<Q><P>;WE desire that this brightning of the Chain, and establishing a strong and firm League of Friendship, may be understood by you, as we understand it to be, not only between the Chiefs of our Nations, and the Chiefs or Principal Men of this Government, but likewise between all our People, and all your People, and between you and all our <HI>Warriours</HI> who go abroad and sometimes pass near this Government, to all of whom we have given the strictest Charge to behave themselves agreeable to the
<PB N="8" REF="004146_0007_1003DC48865B2AB0"/>Friendship which is established between you and us, that so we all may continue to be one People for ever.</P>
<P>At the last Treaty you advised us to strengthen ourselves by entring into firm Leagues of Friendship and Alliance with several other Nations of <HI>Indians</HI> around us; this Advice was truly good, and we thank our Brethren for it; we have accordingly treated with these Six following Nations, <HI>to wit,</HI> the <HI>Onichkaryagoes, Sissaghces, Tioumitihagas, Attawanten's, Twechtwese,</HI> and <HI>Oachtamaghs,</HI> and have engaged them so heartily in our Interest, that they acknowledge us for their Elder Brethren, and have promised to join with us as one People, and to act altogether in Concert with us.</P>
<P>You likewise then advised us to call home all those of our Nations who are at <HI>Canada,</HI> or live amongst the <HI>French,</HI> lest if any Occasion of Difference should arise, they might then be prevented from returning. We esteem this likewise as sound good Advice, and we thank our Brethren for it; the <HI>French</HI> were formerly our cruel Enemies, and we are taking such Measures as we hope will be effectual to bring back our People, if any new Breach should happen.</P></Q>
<P><HI>The Speaker said,</HI></P>
<Q><P>To confirm all that we have now said, we would be glad if we had a large Present of Skins to deliver, in Return to the considerable one in Goods which we had of you; but we must own to you that we are at present but very ill provided and poor, and have only a very small Quantity of Skins, which nevertheless we hope our Brethren will accept.</P></Q>
<P><HI>Here he laid down two small Bundles of Skins.</HI></P>
<Q><P>We have now nothing more to say in Publick; but having other Matters to treat on with the Proprietor, we will enter upon them at another time.</P></Q>
<P>They were told, <HI>That the Proprietor, President and Council thank'd them very kindly in Behalf of this Government, for all they had now said; that they had returned full and distinct Answers to all the Chief Articles or Propositions made at the last great Treaty in</HI> 1732, <HI>they had spoke to each of them like honest Men and true Brethren; and as they had consulted together before they delivered their Answer, so now the Council would meet and consider together of all that had passed at present.</HI></P>
<P>Which being interpreted to them, they expressed their Satisfaction by a Sound peculiar to them, in which they all joined, and then withdrew.</P>

The President representing to the Board the Necessity of dispatching the <HI>Indians</HI> of the <HI>Six</HI> Nations, who being very numerous remain here at a great Charge, proposed that the Consideration of the Value of the Present to be given them, should be now proceeded upon; and accordingly the Board enter∣ing upon the same, and observing that for these many Years there has not been so great an Appearance here of Chiefs of these Nations as at this time, and that they have returned very full and distinct Answers to every Article of the Treaty with them in 1732, are of Opinion, that proper Goods for them to the Value of about <HI>Two Hundred Pounds,</HI> should be pro∣vided and given them; and that to <HI>Conrad Weyser,</HI> the Interpreter, who is extremly useful on all such Occasions, and on the present one has been very serviceable, there be given <HI>Twenty Pounds.</HI></P>

<P>The President informed the Board, that agreeable to the Minute of the 4th, Care had been taken to provide Goods for the Indians: But next Day, after Council, consulting with <HI>Conrad Weyser,</HI> the Interpreter, he had advised that the Delivery of the Present should be delayed till the <HI>Indians</HI> had finished with the Proprietary, with whom they were then to treat about the Purchase of Lands; that most of last Week being spent there∣in, the <HI>Indians</HI> had Yesterday ended with the Proprietary, having signed Releases to him for all the Lands lying between the Mouth of <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> and <HI>Kekachtaninius</HI> Hills, and that it now remained to conclude on the Quantity and Quality of the several Goods to be given them; and on the Substance of what should be proper to be spoke to them; The Board are of Opinion, that considering the large Quantity of Goods which they have had from the Proprietor on the Purchase, it may not at this time be ne∣cessary to give them, in Behalf of this Government, so great a Present as the Value ordered by the aforesaid Minute; but that it may very well be considerably reduced; and accordingly, it is <HI>Ordered,</HI> that it be reduced to between <HI>Sixty</HI> and <HI>Seventy Pounds.</HI></P>
<P>The President likewise acquainting the Board, that the <HI>Indians,</HI> at a Meeting with the Proprietor and him, had taken Notice that <HI>Conrad Wey∣ser,</HI> and <HI>Shekallamy,</HI> were by the Treaty of 1732, appointed as fit and pro∣per Persons to go between the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> and this Government, and to be employed in all Transactions with one another, whose Bodies the <HI>Indians</HI> said were to be equally divided between them and us, we to have one half, and they the other; that they had found <HI>Conrad</HI> faithful and honest, that he is a true good Man, and had spoke their Words, and our Words, and not his own; and the <HI>Indians</HI> having presented him with a drest Skin to make him Shoes, and two Deer Skins, to keep him warm, they said, as they had thus taken Care of our Friend, they must recommend their's <HI>(Shekallamy)</HI> to our Notice; and the Board judging it necessary that a parti∣cular
<PB N="10" REF="004146_0009_1003DC5CF683C3C8"/>Notice should be taken of him, acccordingly, it is, <HI>Ordered,</HI> That <HI>Six Pounds</HI> be laid out for him in such things as he may most want.</P>
<P>It was then recommended to the President, and he undertook, to pre∣pare a Draught of what might be proper to be said to these <HI>Indians</HI> at giving the Present from this Government, and to lay the same before the Board to morrow Morning, at Ten a Clock, to which time the Council adjourned.</P>

<P>The President laid before the Board a draught of a concluding Speech to the Indians, which being read and approved, they were sent for, who being come and seated, the said Speech was delivered to them by the Inter∣preter as follows.</P>
<P><HI>OUR BRETHREN,</HI></P>
<Q><P>FOUR Years since at a great Treaty held here with your Chiefs, we confirmed all our former Treaties with you, we brightned the Chain, kindled our Fire to be kept always burning here for you, opened and cleared the Path between your Country and Ours, and made our∣selves and you one Body and one People.</P>
<P>The Chiefs of all your Nations, being met at your great Fire or Council in the Country of the <HI>Onondagoes,</HI> having heard of and considered that Treaty, were so well pleased with it, that it was agreed, as you have told us, that you, who are the principal of all your Chiefs, should come down and visit us, and more fully and absolutely confirm that Treaty, which you accordingly did a few Days since at our great House in Town, in the presence and hearing of some Thousands of our People, and it was done not only in Behalf of us ourselves and yourselves, but for our Children and Children's Children, to all Generations, as long as the Sun, Moon, and Earth, endure.</P>
<P>Thus this Treaty, by which we are to become as one People, and one Body, is in the strongest Terms confirmed, never to be changed, but to ;be kept in everlasting Remembrance.</P>
<P>But, besides what we have already concluded, we shall now for the further brightning the same Chain, and that no Spot or Blemish may be fixt on it, speak to some Particulars for your more full Satis∣faction.</P>

It has been agreed between us, that we should suffer no Injury to be done to one of your People more than to our own, nor without punish∣ing the Offender in the same manner as if it had been done to one of our People; and you also engaged on your parts that you would give us the like Satisfaction for every Injury done by your People to any of ours, and whatever should happen of this kind, it should make no other Difference, than as if the Injury were done by one <HI>English</HI> or White Man to another, and so in the Case of an <HI>Indian.</HI> Now since you came hi∣ther, we have heard that a White Man one of our People, and one of yours, being both in Liquor, quarrelled at <HI>Allegheny,</HI> that the <HI>Indian</HI> struck at the White Man with a Knife, and the white Man gave the <HI>Indian</HI> some Blows on the Head, of which he died in four or five Days after; that the White Man got out of the way, and hid, and when he heard the Man was dead, he ran away to the <HI>Southward</HI> of <HI>Virginia:</HI> Who was first in the Fault in this matter we know not, but we have now issued a Proclamation for apprehending the White Man, and proposed a Reward of <HI>Ten Pounds,</HI> to any one who will seize and deliver him to some Magistrate or Officer, that he may be put in Prison and tried for his Life; if then it appears that he willfully kill'd the Man, he will be hanged by our Law; if it was in Defence of his own Life, he is not to die for it, but after he is tried we shall acquaint you how the matter appeared. The first Account we had of it was in a Letter, which the Interpreter shall read and acquaint you with it; but that Story being told only on one side, we do not depend on it for the Truth; and thus we shall act in all such Cases, as Brethren always ought whenever they unfortunately happen.</P>
<P>We are very sensible Rum is the principal occasion of these Disorders, and we heartily wish any means could be possibly found to prevent the Abuse of it: You have desired us in your Discourse with the Proprietor to recall all our Traders from <HI>Ohio</HI> or <HI>Allegheny</HI> and the Branches of <HI>Sasque∣hannah;</HI> We desired at our Treaty four Years ago that all our <HI>Indians,</HI> the <HI>Delawares, Shawanese,</HI> and others, should be recalled from <HI>Ohio,</HI> for we knew not then but there might be War with the <HI>French,</HI> and you know the Strength of a People consists in their being drawn close together as into one Body, and not to be scattered; but we know not what you mean by recalling our Traders; for you are sensible the <HI>Indians</HI> cannot live without being supplied with our Goods: They must have Powder and Lead to hunt, and Cloaths to keep them warm; and if our People do not carry them, others will, from <HI>Maryland, Virginia, Jerseys,</HI> or other Places; and we are sure you do not desire that <HI>Indians</HI> should trade with those People rather than with ours. The Traders of all Nations find the <HI>Indians</HI> are so universally fond of Rum, that they will not deal with∣out it: We have made many Laws against carrying it; we have ordered the <HI>Indians</HI> to stave the Caggs of all that is brought amongst them; but the Woods have not Streets like <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> the Paths in them are endless, and they cannot be stopt, so that it will be carried either from one Country or another; and on the other hand the <HI>Indians</HI> are so very fond of the Liquor, even the best of them, that instead of taking it from those who bring it, and staving it, they take and drink it, which is both unjust in it self, and does more Mischief; for the Traders, if they kept
<PB N="12" REF="004146_0011_1003DE63C3FC7A30"/>it, would hand it out by stealth in small Quantities, but the <HI>Indians</HI> when they take it, drink it off by great Quantities; so that no Method we can find will prevent the <HI>Indians</HI> having it, till they are so wise as to refrain it of themselves; and, Why are they not so wise? they shew very good strong Sense in other things, and why cannot they act like us? All of us here, and all you see of any Credit in the Place, can every Day have as much Rum of their own to drink as they please, and yet scarce one of us will take a Dram, at least not one Man will on any Ac∣count be drunk, no not if he were hired to it with great Sums of Money.</P>
<P>And now to bind and confirm all these our Words, we have provided for you the following Goods, which will be delivered to you to morrow at the President's Lodgings, <HI>to wit.</HI></P></Q>

<P>The Council rising, and the President with the Proprietor staying, the <HI>In∣dians</HI> entered into further Discourse, and said, <HI>They had received a Message with some</HI> Wampum <HI>from the Governor of</HI> Maryland, <HI>informing them, he had received a Letter from the King of</HI> England, <HI>ordering him to see that they should not be wronged of their Lands; that he had understood this Government had wronged them, and if they would send some of their People to him, he would take care they should be righted, he would write to the great King, who would give such Orders as that they should have Justice done them. Being asked how they received that Message, they said, the Man who brought it was here now with them, they had the</HI> Wampum <HI>and would shew it to us; and they earnestly pressed that we would write to the Governors of</HI> Maryland <HI>and</HI> Virginia <HI>to make them Satisfaction for the Lands belonging to them (the Indians) which the People of those Governments were possessed of, that had never been purchased of them; that all the Lands on</HI> Sasquehannah <HI>and at</HI> Chanandowa <HI>were theirs, and they must be satisfied for them; that they had agreed with us for the Lands they now re∣leased to us, but they had never received any thing from the other Governments to the Southward, for theirs.</HI></P>
<P>They were told, That on their receiving the Present to morrow, they should be answered on these Heads; and after being entertained by the Pro∣prietor, they withdrew.</P>

<HEAD><HI>October</HI> 14.</HEAD>
<P>The Honourable the Proprietor, the President, with some of the Council met this Forenoon, and the <HI>Indian</HI> Chiefs being come and seated.</P>
<P>Their Speaker, having some Parcels of Skins laid before him, rose; and by the Interpreter said;</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004146_0012_1003DC70F28570F0"/>
That they were now to speak to the Proprietor and our People for the last time this Visit; that we had spoke to them last night, and recapitulated the Heads of all that had been agreed between them and us, as the Fire, the Path, the Chain; that we are now become one People; with every other Article that had been mentioned between us: This they will remember on their Parts through all Generations, and they desire that we may remember the same as long as the Earth endures.</P>
<P><HI>That having now brightened the Chain, and confirmed all the Articles necessary for establishing perfect Friendship between them and us, and being thus become one People, they must desire that we would be more reasonable in the Sale of our Goods, which are much dearer (they say) from our Traders than from those of</HI> New-York; <HI>that the Powder sold by the Traders of</HI> New-York, <HI>is generally found to be mixed with black Dust, so that the Bullet falls often short of the Mark thro' the Badness of the Powder; that if we would sell cheap, we might thereby draw a great Trade to this Province, far beyond that of any others, which would be to our Advantage.</HI></P>
<P>And hereupon he laid down a Bundle of Skins, and said,</P>
<P><HI>That amongst them there is never any Victuals sold, the Indians give to each o∣ther freely what they can spare; but if they come amongst our People, they can have none without paying; they admire we should take Money on this Score.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That having now finished, and preparing to return home, as several of them are old Men, they request that we would help them on their Journey, by assisting them with Horses and some Carriages for their Goods; that as we have many Hor∣ses and Carriages, they desire we would spare them some for their Use, who are our Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>And hereupon he laid down two Bundles of Skins;</P>
<P>Then proceeding, he said,</P>
<P><HI>That they must desire us to write to the Governors of</HI> Virginia <HI>and</HI> Maryland, <HI>who are possessed of their Lands, without ever considering the Indians for them, and request that we would take the Answers of those Governors, which next Spring some of their Nations will come to receive at the Fire kept for them in this Place; That they intend to apply to the great King on the other Side of the Wa∣ter, and let him know what they expect on this Head from his People.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That if</HI> Civility <HI>at</HI> Conestogoe, <HI>should attempt to make a Sale of any Lands to us or any of our Neighbours, they must let us know, that he both no Power to do so; and if he does any thing of the kind, they the Indians will utterly disown him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That last night we told them the Woods were very dark, and that it was impos∣sible to prevent Rum being carried to</HI> Allegheny; <HI>that if the Case be thus, we had better hinder any Persons from going thither at all, and confine our Traders to the River</HI> Sasquehannah <HI>and its Branches; for as several Indian</HI> Warriours <HI>pass by</HI> Allegheny, <HI>where so much Rum is constantly to be had, they cannot but be ve∣ry apprehensive that some Mischief may happen; this Consideration often troubles them.</HI></P>
<P>In Answer to all which, the <HI>Indians</HI> were thus told by the Interpreter.</P>
<Q><P>THAT as to all that had passed relating to the Chain, Road and Fire, we have now firmly and fully established and confirmed all these
<PB N="14" REF="004146_0013_1003B93E2C26D370"/>Articles, to be kept in perpetual Remembrance by them and us, and by our Children and their Children to all Generations.</P>
<P>That as to the Deamess of Goods carried amongst them, the Govern∣ment here has no Concern in the Trade, it is entirely carried on by pri∣vate People; those that go amongst the <HI>Indians</HI> purchase the Goods they carry with them at the easiest Rate, and we are told, that considering the Length of Way they carry them, they are sold so cheap, that these Tra∣ders can be but small Gainers; but the Prices of Goods are not under any Regulation, they get for them what they can.</P>
<P>That all the white People, tho' they live together as Brethren, have each nevertheless distinct Properties and Interests, and none of us can demand from another Victuals or any thing of the Kind without Pay∣ment. One Man raises Corn and sells it, another raises Horses and he sells them, and thus every Man lives by his own Labour and Industry, and no one has a Right to take away from another what he thus earns for himself; and all Victuals cost Money.</P>
<P>That proper Care will be taken, as has formerly been done, to supply them with Horses and Carriages to make their Journey home as easy as possible.</P>
<P>That we would be glad to do them any Service with the Neighbour∣ing Governments, but we do not clearly understand this Matter: As to what is said of a Letter from the King of <HI>England,</HI> we do not believe there is any Truth in that Report; we have indeed heard of a Letter sent up to <HI>Sasquehannah</HI> from the Governor of <HI>Maryland;</HI> if he mentions any thing in it of Orders from the King of <HI>England,</HI> they should send some Persons to that Government to enquire into the Matter. As to the Claim they make on the Lands of <HI>Maryland</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> we know not how this is supported; the Lands on <HI>Sasquehannah,</HI> we believe, belong to the <HI>Six Nations,</HI> by the Conquest of the <HI>Indians</HI> of that River; but how their Pre∣tentions are made good to the Lands to the Southward, we know not; and we ought to be better informed before we can write on this Head.</P>
<P>That we cannot prevent our Traders from going where they may best dispose of their Goods; we shall take the most proper Measures in our Power to hinder their carrying Rum in such Quantities, and we hope the <HI>Indians</HI> will give strict Charge to the Warriours to be cautious and prudent, that all Kind of Mischief may be prevented.</P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Indians</HI> appearing satisfied with what had been spoke to them, said they had nothing further to offer. The Present was then delivered to them, which they received with great Thankfulness, those of each Nation alter∣nately by themselves, and then all of them together, joining in their usual solemn Sound, when they express their Satisfaction. Having afterwards drank a friendly Glass, and taking Leave of the Proprietor, President and Court they departed; and thus the Treaty ended.</P>
