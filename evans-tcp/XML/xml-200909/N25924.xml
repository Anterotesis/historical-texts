<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>IN fulfilling the engagement which I had come under to the Public, with respect to the HIS∣TORY of AMERICA, it was my intention not to have published any part of the work, until the whole was completed. The present state of the British Colonies has induced me to alter that resolution. While they are engaged in civil war with Great Britain, inquiries and specula∣tions concerning their ancient forms of policy and laws, which exist no longer, cannot be in∣teresting. The attention and expectation of man∣kind are now turned towards their future condi∣tion. In whatever manner this unhappy contest may terminate, a new order of things must arise in North America, and its affairs will assume another aspect. I wait with the solicitude of a good citizen, until the ferment subside, and regu∣lar government be re-established, and then I shall return to this part of my work, in which I had made some progress. That, together with the history of Portuguese America, and of the set∣tlements made by the several nations of Europe in the West India islands, will complete my plan.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="034476_0003_0FFDD42E77EF4278"/>THE three volumes which I now publish, con∣tain an account of the discovery of the New World, and of the progress of the Spanish arms and colonies there. This is not only the most splendid portion of the American story, but so much detached, as, by itself, to form a perfect whole, remarkable for the unity of the subject. As the principles and maxims of the Spaniards in planting colonies, which have been adopted in some measure by every nation, are unfolded in this part of my work; it will serve as a proper introduction to the history of all the European establishments in America, and convey such information concerning this important article of policy, as may be deemed no less interesting than curious.</P>
<P>IN describing the atchievements and institutions of the Spaniards in the New World, I have de∣parted in many instances from the accounts of pre∣ceding historians, and have often related facts which seem to have been unknown to them. It is a duty I owe the Public, to mention the sources from which I have derived such intelligence, as justifies me either in placing transactions in a new light, or in forming any new opinion with respect to their causes and effects. This duty I perform with greater satisfaction, as it will afford an op∣portunity of expressing my gratitude to those be∣nefactors, who have honoured me with their coun∣tenance and aid in my researches.</P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="034476_0004_0FFDD4314906BEC8"/>AS it was from Spain that I had to expect the most important information, with regard to this part of my-work, I considered it as a very fortu∣nate circumstance for me, when Lord Grantham, to whom I had the honour of being personally known, and with whose liberality of sentiment, and disposition to oblige, I was well acquainted, was appointed ambassador to the court of Madrid. Upon applying to him, I met with such a recep∣tion as satisfied me that his endeavours would be employed in the most proper manner, in order to obtain the gratification of my wishes; and I am perfectly sensible, that what progress I have made in my inquiries among the Spaniards, ought to be ascribed chiefly to their knowing how much his Lordship interested himself in my success.</P>
<P>BUT did I owe nothing more to Lord Grantham, than the advantages which I have derived from his attention in engaging Mr. Waddilove, the chaplain of his embassy, to take the conduct of my literary inquiries in Spain, the obligations I lie under to him would be very great. During five years, that gentleman has carried on research∣es for my behoof, with such activity, preseve∣rance, and knowledge of the subject, to which his attention was turned, as have filled me with no less astonishment than satisfaction. He pro∣cured for me the greater part of the Spanish books, which I have consulted; and as many of
<PB REF="034476_0005_0FFDD433DBF086E0"/>
them were printed early in the sixteenth century, and are become extremely rare, the collecting of these was such an occupation, as, alone, requir∣ed much time and assiduity. To his friendly at∣tention I am indebted for copies of several valu∣able manuscripts, containing facts and details which I might have searched for in vain, in works that have been made public. Encouraged by the inviting good-will with which Mr. Waddilove conferred his favours, I transmitted to him a set of queries, with respect both to the customs and policy of the native Americans, and the nature of several institutions in the Spanish settlements, framed in such a manner, that a Spaniard might answer them, without disclosing any thing that was improper to be communicated to a foreigner. He translated these into Spanish, and obtained from various persons who have resided in most of the Spanish colonies, such replies as have afforded me much instruction.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING those peculiar advantages with which my inquiries were carried on in Spain, it is with regret I am obliged to add, that their success must be ascribed to the beneficence of in∣dividuals, not to any communication by public authority. By a single arrangement of Philip II. the records of the Spanish monarchy are deposited in the <HI>Archivo</HI> of Simancas, near Valladolid, at the distance of a hundred and twenty miles from the seat of government, and the supreme courts of
<PB N="vii" REF="034476_0006_0FFDD4366E6BE558"/>
justice. The papers relative to America, and chiefly to that early period of its history, towards which my attention was directed, are so numerous, that they alone, according to one account, fill the largest apartment in the Archivo; and according to another, they compose eight hundred and seventy-three large bundles. Conscious of pos∣sessing, in some degree, the industry which be∣longs to an historian, the prospect of such a trea∣sure excited my most ardent curiosity. But the prospect of it, is all that I have enjoyed. Spain, with an excess of caution, has uniformly thrown a veil over her transactions in America. From strangers they are concealed with peculiar solici∣tude. Even to her own subjects the Archivo of Simancas is not opened without a particular order from the crown; and after obtaining that, papers cannot be copied, without paying fees of office so exorbitant, that the expence exceeds what it would be proper to bestow, when the gratification of literary curiosity is the only object. It is to be hoped, that the Spaniards will at last discover this system of concealment to be no less impolitic than illiberal. From what I have experienced in the course of my inquiries, I am satisfied, that upon a more minute scrutiny into their early operations in the New World, however reprehensible the actions of individuals may appear, the conduct of the nation will be placed in a more favourable light.</P>
<P><PB N="viii" REF="034476_0007_0FFDD4390B4FF730"/>IN other parts of Europe very different senti∣ments prevail. Having searched, without success, in Spain, for a letter of Cortes to Charles V. written soon after he landed in the Mexican em∣pire, which has not hitherto been published: it occurred to me, that as the Emperor was setting out for Germany at the time when the messengers from Cortes arrived in Europe, the letter with which they were intrusted might possibly be pre∣served in the Imperial library of Vienna. I com∣municated this idea to Sir Robert Murray Keith, with whom I have long had the honour to live in friendship, and I had soon the pleasure to learn, that upon his application, her Imperial Majesty had been graciously pleased to issue an order, that not only a copy of that letter (if it were found), but of any other papers in the library, which could throw light upon the History of America, should be transmited to me. The letter from Cortes is not in the Imperial library, but an au∣thentic copy, attested by a notary, of the letter written by the magistrates of the colony planted by him at Vera Cruz, which I have mentioned, Vol. ii. p. 269, having been found, it was trans∣cribed and sent to me. As this letter is no less curious, and as little known as that which was the object of my inquiries, I have given some ac∣count, in its proper place, of what is most worthy of notice in it. Together with it, I received a copy of a letter from Cortes, containing a long account of
<PB N="ix" REF="034476_0008_0FFDD43BA1010538"/>
his expeditions to Honduras, with respect to which, I did not think it necessary to enter into any particular detail; and likewise those curious Mexican paintings, which I have described, Vol. ii.</P>
<P>MY inquiries at St. Petersburgh were carried on with equal facility and success. In examining into the nearest communication between our con∣tinent and that of America, it became of conse∣quence to obtain authentic information concerning the discoveries of the Russians in their navigation from Kamchatka towards the coast of America. Accurate relations of their first voyage, in 1741, have been published by Muller and Gmelin. Several foreign authors have entertained an opinion, that the court of Russia studiously conceals the progress which has been made by more recent navigators, and suffers the Public to be amused with false ac∣counts of their route. Such conduct appeared to me unsuitable to those liberal sentiments, and that patronage of science, for which the present sove∣reign of Russia is eminent; nor could I discern any political reason, that might render it improper to apply for information concerning the late at∣tempts of the Russians to open a communication be∣tween Asia and America. My ingenious coun∣tryman, Dr. Rogerson, first physician to the em∣press, presented my request to her Imperial Ma∣jesty, who not only disclaimed any idea of con∣cealment, but instantly ordered the Journal of Captain Krenitzin, who conducted the only voy∣age
<PB N="x" REF="034476_0009_0FFDD43D3340CDC8"/>
of discovery made by public authority since the year 1741, to be translated, and his original chart to be copied for my use. By consulting them, I have been enabled to give a more accu∣rate view of the progress and extent of the Russian discoveries, than has hitherto been communicated to the Public.</P>
<P>FROM other quarters I have received informa∣tion of great utility and importance. M. le Che∣valier de Pinto, the minister from Portugal to the court of Great Britain, who commanded for se∣veral years at Matagrosso, a settlement of the Portuguese in the interior part of Brazil, where the Indians are numerous, and their original man∣ners little altered by intercourse with Europeans, was pleased to send me very full answers to some queries concerning the character and institutions of the natives of America, which his polite re∣ception of an application made to him in my name, encouraged me to propose. These satis∣fied me, that he had contemplated with a discern∣ing attention the curious objects which his situa∣tion presented to his view, and I have often fol∣lowed him as one of my best-instructed guides.</P>
<P>M. SUARD, to whose elegant translation of the History of the Reign of Charles V. I owe the favourable reception of that work on the continent, procured me answers to the same queries from M. de Bougainville, who had op∣portunities of observing the Indians both of North
<PB N="xi" REF="034476_0010_0FFDD440CED58410"/>
and South America, and from M. Godin le Jeune, who resided fifteen years among Indians in Quito, and twenty years in Cayenne. The latter are more valuable from having been examined by M. de la Condamine, who, a few weeks before his death, made some short additions to them, which may be considered as the last effort of that atten∣tion to science which occupied a long life.</P>
<P>MY inquiries were not confined to one region in America. Governor Hutchinson took the trouble of recommending the consideration of my queries to Mr. Hawley and Mr. Brainerd, two protestant missionaries, employed among the In∣dians of the Five Nations, who favoured me with answers, which discover a considerable knowledge of the people whose customs they discribe. From William Smith, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the ingenious historian of New York, I received some useful information. When I enter upon the History of our Colonies in North America, I shall have occasion to ac∣knowledge how much I have been indebted to many other gentlemen of that country.</P>
<P>FROM the valuable Collection of Voyages made by Alexander Dalrymple, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> with whose at∣tention to the History of Navigation and Discovery the Public is well acquainted, I have received some very rare books, particularly two large volumes of Memorials, partly manuscript, and partly in print, which were presented to the court of Spain during the reigns of Philip III. and Philip IV.
<PB N="xii" REF="034476_0011_0FFDD443A2588AA0"/>
From these I have learned many curious particulars with respect to the interior state of the Spanish colonies, and the various schemes formed for their improvement. As this Collection of Memorials formerly belonged to the Colbert Library, I have quoted them by that title.</P>
<P>ALL those books and manuscripts I have con∣sulted with that attention which the respect due from an Author to the Public required; and by minute references to them, I have endeavoured to authenticate whatever I relate. The longer I reflect on the nature of historical composition, the more I am convinced that this scrupulous ac∣curacy is necessary. The historian who records the events of his own time, is credited in propor∣tion to the opinion which the Public entertains with respect to his means of information and his veracity. He who delineates the transactions of a remote period, has no title to claim assent, unless he produces evidence in proof of his assertions. Without this, he may write an amusing tale, but cannot be said to have composed an authentic history. In those sentiments I have been confirm∣ed by the opinion of an Author<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Gibbon.</NOTE>, whom his in∣dustry, erudition, and discernment, have deserv∣edly placed in a high rank among the most emi∣nent historians of the age. Emboldened by a hint from him, I have published a catalogue of the Spanish books which I have consulted. This prac∣tice
<PB N="xiii" REF="034476_0012_0FFDD4454B4400B0"/>
was frequent in the last century, and was considered as an evidence of laudable industry, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in an author; in the present, it may, perhaps, be deemed the effect of ostentation; but as many of these books are unknown in Great Britain, I could not otherwise have referred to them as au∣thorities, without incumbering the page with an insertion of their full titles. To any person who may chuse to follow me in this path of inquiry, the catalogue must be very useful.</P>
<P>MY readers will observe, that in mentioning sums of money, I have uniformly followed the Spanish method of computing by <HI>pesos.</HI> In Ame∣rica, the peso <HI>fuerte,</HI> or <HI>duro,</HI> is the only one known, and that is always meant when any sum imported from America is mentioned. The peso fuerte, as well as other coins, has varied in its numerary value; but I have been advised, without attending to such minute variations, to consider it as equal to four shillings and sixpence of our money. It is to be remembered, however, that in the sixteenth century, the effective value of a peso, i. e. the quantity of labour which it repre∣sented, or of goods which it would purchase, was five or six times as much as at present.</P>
<P>N. B. Since this edition was put into the press, a History of Mexico, in two volumes in quarto, translated from the Italian of the Abbé D. Fran∣cesco Saverio Clavigero, has been published. From a person, who is a native of New Spain,
<PB N="xiv" REF="034476_0013_0FFDD449E30702B0"/>
who has resided forty years in that country, and who is acquainted with the Mexican language, it was natural to expect much new information. Upon perusing his work, however, I find that it contains hardly any addition to the ancient History of the Mexican empire, as related by Acosta and Herrea, but what is derived from the impro∣bable narratives and fanciful conjectures of Tor∣quemada and Boturini. Having copied their splendid descriptions of the high state of civiliza∣tion in the Mexican empire, M. Clavigero, in the abundance of his zeal for the honour of his native country, charges me with having mistaken some points, and with having misrepresented others, in the History of it. When an author is conscious of having exerted industry in research and im∣partiality in decision; he may without presump∣tion, claim what praise is due to these qualities, and he cannot be insensible to any accusation that tends to weaken the force of his claim. A feel∣ing of this kind has induced me to examine such strictures of M. Clavigero on my History of Ame∣rica as merited any attention, especially as these are made by one, who seemed to possess the means of obtaining accurate information; and to shew that the greater part of them is destitute of any just found∣ation. This I have done in notes upon the passages in my History, which gave rise to his criticisms.</P>

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF <HI>AMERICA.</HI> BOOK I.</HEAD>
<P>THE progress of men in discovering and peo∣pling the various parts of the earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK I. The earth slowly peo∣pled.</NOTE> has been extremely slow. Several ages elapsed before they removed far from those mild and fertile regions in which they were originally placed by their Creator. The occasion of their first general dis∣persion is known; but we are unacquainted with the course of their migrations, or the time when they took possession of the different countries which they now inhabit. Neither history nor tradition furnish such information concerning those remote events, as enables us to trace, with any certainty, the operations of the human race in the infancy of society.</P>
<P>WE may conclude, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First migra∣tions by land.</NOTE> that all the early migrations of mankind were made by land. The ocean, which surrounds the habitable earth, as well as the various arms of the sea which separate one region from another, though destined to facilitate the communication between distant countries, seem, at first; view, to be formed to check the progress of man and to mark the bounds of that portion of the globe to which nature had confined him It was long, we may believe, before men attempted
<PB N="38" REF="034476_0036_0FFDD486460780B8"/>
to pass these formidable barriers, and became so skilful and adventrous as to commit themselves to the mercy of the winds and waves, or to quit their native shores in quest of remote and unknown re∣gions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First at∣tempts to∣wards navi∣gation.</NOTE>NAVIGATION and ship-building are arts so nice and complicated, that they require the ingenuity, as well as experience, of many successive ages to bring them to any degree of perfection. From the raft or canoe, which first served to carry a savage over the river that obstructed him in the chace, to the construction of a vessel capable of conveying a numerous crew with safety to a distant coast, the progress in improvement is immense. Many efforts would be made, many experiments would be tried, and much labour as well as invention would be employed, before men could accomplish this ardu∣ous and important undertaking. The rude and imperfect state in which navigation is still found among all nations which are not considerably civil∣ized, corresponds with this account of its progress, and demonstrates that, in early times, the art was not so far improved as to enable men to undertake distant voyages, or to attempt remote discoveries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Introduc∣tion of commerce.</NOTE>AS soon however, as the art of navigation be∣came known, a new species of correspondence among men took place. It is from this aera, that we must date the commencement of such an inter∣course between nations as deserves the appellation of commerce. Men are, indeed, far advanced in improvement before commerce becomes an object of great importance to them. They must even have made some considerable progress towards ci∣vilization, before they acquire the idea of property, and ascertain it so perfectly as to be acquainted with the most simple of all contracts, that of ex∣changing by barter one rude commodity for ano∣ther. But as soon as this important right is esta∣blished, and every individual feels that he has an
<PB N="39" REF="034476_0037_0FFDD489DA2728F0"/>
exclusive title to possess or to alienate whatever he has acquired by his own labour or dexterity, the wants and ingenuity of his nature suggest to him a new method of increasing his acquisitions and en∣joyments, by disposing of what is superfluous in his own stores, in order to procure what is neces∣sary or desirable in those of other men. Thus a commercial intercourse begins, and is carried on among the members of the same community. By degrees, they discover that neighbouring tribes pos∣sess what they themselves want, and enjoy com∣forts of which they wish to partake In the same mode, and upon the same principles, that domestic traffic is carried on within the society, an external commerce is established with other tribes or nations. Their mutual interest and mutual wants render this intercourse desirable, and imperceptibly introduce the maxims and laws which facilitate its progress and render it secure. But no very extensive com∣merce can take place between contiguous provin∣ces, whose soil and climate being nearly the same, yield similar productions. Remote countries can∣not convey their commodities by land, to those places, where on account of their rarity they are desired, and become valuable. It is to navigation that men are indebted for the power of transport∣ing the superfluous stock of one part of the earth, to supply the wants of another. The luxuries and blessings of a particular climate are no longer con∣fined to itself alone, but the enjoyment of them is communicated to the most distant regions.</P>
<P>IN proportion as the knowledge of the advan∣tages derived from navigation and commerce con∣tinued to spread, the intercourse among nations ex∣tended. The ambition of conquest, or the neces∣sity of procuring new settlements, were no longer the sole motives of visiting distant lands. The de∣sire of gain became a new incentive to activity, roused adventurers, and sent them forth upon long
<PB N="40" REF="034476_0038_0FFDD48C6E686EA0"/>
voyages, in search of countries, whose products or wants might increase that circulation, which nou∣rishes and gives vigour to commerce. Trade prov∣ed a great source of discovery, it opened unknown seas, it penetrated into new regions, and contri∣buted more than any other cause, to bring men ac∣quainted with the situation, the nature, and com∣modities of the different parts of the globe. But even after a regular commerce was established in the world, after nations were considerably civilized, and the sciences and arts were cultivated with ar∣dour and success, navigation continued to be so imperfect, that it can hardly be said to have ad∣vanced beyond the infancy of its improvement in the ancient world.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Imperfec∣tion of na∣vigation a∣mong the ancients.</NOTE>AMONG all the nations of antiquity the structure of their vessels was extremely rude, and their me∣thod of working them very defective. They were unacquainted with several principles and operations in navigation, which are now considered as the first elements on which that science is founded. Though that property of the magnet, by which it attracts iron, was well known to the ancients, its more im∣portant and amazing virtue of pointing to the poles had entirely escaped their observation. Destitute of this faithful guide, which now conducts the pilot with so much certainty in the unbounded ocean, during the darkness of night, or when the heavens are covered with clouds, the ancients had no other method of regulating their course than by observ∣ing the sun and stars. Their navigation was of consequence uncertain and timid. They durst seldom quit sight of land, but crept along the coast, exposed to all the dangers, and retarded by all the obstructions, unavoidable in holding such an aukward course. An incredible length of time was requisite for performing voyages, which are now finished in a short space. Even in the mildest
<PB N="41" REF="034476_0039_0FFDD48E290B37A8"/>
climates, and in seas the least tempestuous, it was only during the summer months that the ancients ventured out of their harbours. The remainder of the year was lost in inactivity. It would have been deemed most inconsiderate rashness to have braved the fury of the winds and waves during winter.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vegetius de Re milit. lib. iv.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHILE both the science and practice of naviga∣tion continued to be so defective, it was an under∣taking of no small difficulty and danger to visit any remote region of the earth. Under every disad∣vantage, however, the active spirit of commerce exerted itself. The Egyptians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Navigation and com∣merce of the Egyp∣tians.</NOTE> soon after the esta∣blishment of their monarchy, are said to have opened a trade between the Arabian Gulph or Red Sea, and the western coast of the great Indian continent. The commodities which they imported from the east, were carried by land from the Ara∣bian Gulph to the banks of the Nile, and conveyed down that river to the Mediterranean. But if the Egyptians in early times applied themselves to com∣merce, their attention to it was of short duration. The fertile soil and mild climate of Egypt produced the necessaries and comforts of life with such pro∣fusion, as rendered its inhabitants so independent of other countries, that it became an established maxim among that people, whose ideas and institu∣tions differed in almost every point from those of other nations, to renounce all intercourse with fo∣reigners. In consequence of this, they never went out of their own country; they held all sea-faring persons in detestation, as impious and profane; and fortifying their own harbours, they denied strangers admittance into them. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Diod. Sicul. lib. i. p. 78. Ed. Wesselingi. Amst. 1756. Strabo, lib. xvii. p. 1142. Ed. Amst. 1707.</NOTE> It was in the decline of their power, and when their veneration
<PB N="42" REF="034476_0040_0FFDD491C721D228"/>
for ancient maxims had greatly abated, that they again opened their ports, and resumed any com∣munication with foreigners.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Phe∣nicians.</NOTE>THE character and situation of the Phenicians were as favourable to the spirit of commerce and discovery as those of the Egyptians were adverse to it. They had no distinguishing peculiarity in their manners and institutions; they were not addicted to any singular and unsocial form of superstition; they could mingle with other nations without scruple or reluctance. The territory which they possessed was neither large nor fertile. Commerce was the only source from which they could derive opulence or power. Accordingly, the trade car∣ried on by the Phenicians of Sidon and Tyre, was more extensive and enterprising than that of any state in the ancient world. The genius of the Phe∣nicians, as well as the object of their policy and the spirit of their laws, were entirely commercial. They were a people of merchants who aimed at the empire of the sea, and actually possessed it. Their ships not only frequented all the ports in the Me∣diterranean, but they were the first who ventured beyond the ancient boundaries of navigation, and passing the Streights of Gades, visited the western coasts of Spain and Africa. In many of the places to which they resorted, they planted colonies, and communicated to the rude inhabitants some know∣ledge of their arts and improvements. While they extended their discoveries towards the north and the west, they did not neglect to penetrate into the more opulent and fertile regions of the south and east. Having rendered themselves masters of seve∣ral commodious harbours towards the bottom of the Arabian Gulph, they, after the example of the Egyptians, established a regular intercourse with Arabia and the continent of India on the one hand, and with the eastern coast of Africa on the other.
<PB N="43" REF="034476_0041_0FFDD4945BC00CB8"/>
From these countries they imported many valuable commodities, unknown to the rest of the world, and during a long period, engrossed that lucrative branch of commerce without a rival.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE I. in Vol. I.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE vast wealth which the Phenicians acquired by monopolizing the trade carried on in the Red Sea, incited their neighbours the Jews,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Jews</NOTE> under the prosperous reigns of David and Solomon, to aim at being admitted to some share of it. This they obtained partly by their conquest of Idumea, which stretches along the Red Sea, and partly by their alliance with Hiram King of Tyre. Solomon fit∣ted out fleets, which, under the direction of Phe∣nician pilots, sailed from the Red Sea to Tarshish and Ophir. These it is probable were ports in In∣dia and Africa which their conductors were ac∣customed to frequent, and from them the Jewish ships returned with such valuable cargoes as sud∣denly diffused wealth and splendour through the kingdom of Israel.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Memoire sur le Pays d'Ophir par M. D'Anville, Mem. de l'Academ. des Inscript. &amp;c. tom. xxx. 83.</NOTE> But the singular institutions of the Jews, the observance of which was enjoined by their divine legislator, with an intention of pre∣serving them a separate people, uninfected by ido∣latry, formed a national character incapable of that open and liberal intercourse with strangers which commerce requires. Accordingly, this unsocial genius of the people, together with the disasters which befel the kingdom of Israel, prevented the commercial spirit which their monarchs laboured to introduce, and to cherish, from spreading among them. The Jews cannot be numbered among the nations which contributed to improve navigation, or to extend discovery.</P>

temper of the Jews, in opposition to the tendency of their laws, they transmitted the commercial spirit with facility, and in full vigour, to their own de∣scendants the Carthaginians. The commonwealth of Carthage applied to trade and to naval affairs, with no less ardour, ingenuity, and success, than its parent state. Carthage early rivalled, and soon surpassed Tyre, in opulence and power, but seems not to have aimed at obtaining any share in the commerce with India. The Phenicians had en∣grossed this, and had such a command of the Red Sea, as secured to them the exclusive possession of that lucrative branch of trade. The commercial activity of the Carthaginians was exerted in another direction. Without contending for the trade of the east with their mother-country, they extended their navigation chiefly towards the west and north. Following the course which the Phenicians had opened, they passed the Streights of Gades, and pushing their discoveries far beyond those of the parent state, visited not only all the coasts of Spain, but those of Gaul, and penetrated at last into Bri∣tain. At the same time that they acquired know∣ledge of new countries in this part of the globe, they gradually carried their researches towards the South. They made considerable progress, by land, into the interior provinces of Africa, traded with some of them, and subjected others to their em∣pire. They sailed along the western coast of that great continent, almost to the tropic of Cancer, and planted several colonies, in order to civilize the natives, and accustom them to commerce. They discovered the Fortunate Islands, now known by the name of the Canaries, the utmost boundary of ancient navigation in the western ocean.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plinii Nat.

<P><PB N="45" REF="034476_0043_0FFDD49889A02450"/>NOR was the progress of the Phenicians and Carthaginians in their knowledge of the globe, owing entirely to the desire of extending their trade from one country to another. Commerce was followed by its usual effects among both these people. It awakened curiosity, enlarged the ideas and desires of men, and incited them to bold enter∣prises. Voyages were undertaken, the sole object of which was to discover new countries, and to ex∣plore unknown seas. Such during the prosperous age of the Carthaginian republic, were the famous navigations of Hanno and Himilco. Both their fleets were equipped by authority of the senate, and at public expence. Hanno was directed to steer towards the south, along the coast of Africa, and he seems to have advanced much nearer the equi∣noctial line than any former navigator<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plinii Nat. Hist. lib. v. c. i. Hannonis Periplus ap. Geograph. minores, edit. Hudsoni, vol. p. 1.</NOTE>.

which I have related, may justly be reckoned the greatest effort of navigation in the ancient world; and if we attend to the imperfect state of the art at that time, it is difficult to determine, whether we should most admire the courage and sagacity with which the design was formed, or the conduct and good fortune with which it was executed. But un∣fortunately, all the original and authentic accounts of the Phenician and Carthaginian voyages, whether undertaken by public authority, or in prosecution of their private trade, have perished. The in∣formation which we receive concerning them from the Greek and Roman authors, is not only obscure and inaccurate, but, if we except a short narrative of Hanno's expedition, is of suspicious authority.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE II.</NOTE> Whatever acquaintance with the remote regions of the earth the Phenicians or Carthaginians may have acquired, was concealed from the rest of mankind with a mercantile jealousy. Every thing relative to the course of their navigation was not only a mystery of trade, but a secret of state.

their extraordinary skill in naval affairs seem, in a great measure to have perished, when the mari∣time power of the former was annihilated by Alex∣ander's conquest of Tyre, and the empire of the latter was overturned by the Roman arms.</P>
<P>LEAVING then the obscure and pompous ac∣counts of the Phenician and Carthaginian voyages to the curiosity and conjectures of antiquaries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Greek<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> his∣tory must rest satisfied with relating the progress of navigation and discovery among the Greeks and Romans, which, though less splendid, is better as∣certained. It is evident that the Phenicians, who instructed the Greeks in many other useful sciences and arts, did not communicate to them that exten∣sive knowledge of navigation which they them∣selves possessed; nor did the Romans imbibe that commercial spirit and ardour for discovery which distinguished their rivals the Carthaginians.— Though Greece be almost encompassed by the sea, which formed many spacious bays and commodious harbours, though it be surrounded by a great num∣ber of fertile islands, yet notwithstanding such a favourable situation, which seemed to invite that ingenious people to apply themselves to navigation, it was long before this a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t attained any degree of perfection among them. Their early voyages, the object of which was piracy rather than commerce, were so inconsiderable, that the expedition of the Argonauts from the coast of Thessaly to the Eux∣ine sea, appeared such an amazing effort of skill and courage, as entitled the conductors of it to be ranked among the demigods, and exalted the vessel in which they sailed to a place among the heavenly constellations. Even at a later period, when the Greeks engaged in their famous enterprize against Troy, their knowledge in naval affairs seems not to have been much improved. According to the ac∣count of Homer, the only poet to whom history
<PB N="48" REF="034476_0046_0FFDD4A05712B530"/>
ventures to appeal, and who, by his scrupulous accuracy in describing the manners and arts of early ages, merits this distinction, the science of navigation, at that time, had hardly advanced be∣yond its rudest state. The Greeks in the heroic age seem to have been unacquainted with the use of iron, the most serviceable of all the metals, with∣out which no considerable progress was ever made in the mechanical arts. Their vessels were of con∣siderable burthen, and mostly without decks. They had only one mast, which was erected or taken down at pleasure. They were strangers to the use of anchors. All their operations in sailing were clumsy and unskilful. They turned their ob∣servations towards stars, which were improper for regulating their course, and their mode of ob∣serving them was inaccurate and fallacious. When they had finished a voyage they drew their paltry barks ashore, as savages do their canoes, and these remained on dry land until the season of returning to sea approached. It is not then in the early or heroic ages of Greece that we can expect to ob∣serve the science of navigation, and the spirit of discovery, making any considerable progress. Du∣ring that period of disorder and ignorance, a thou∣sand causes concurred in restraining curiosity and enterprize within very narrow bounds.</P>
<P>BUT the Greeks advanced with rapidity to a state of greater civilization and refinement. Go∣vernment in its most liberal and perfect form, be∣gan to be established in their different communi∣ties; equal laws and regular police were gradually introduced; the sciences and arts which are useful or ornamental in life were carried to a high pitch of improvement, and several of the Grecian com∣monwealths applied to commerce with such ardour and success, that they were considered, in the an∣cient world, as maritime powers of the first rank.
<PB N="49" REF="034476_0047_0FFDD4A328A41D20"/>
Even then, however, the naval victories of the Greeks must be ascribed rather to the native spirit of the people, and to that courage which the en∣joyment of liberty inspires, than to any extraor∣dinary progress in the science of navigation. In the Persian war, those exploits which the genius of the Greek historians has rendered so famous, were performed by fleets, composed chiefly of small ves∣sels without decks;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Thucyd. lib. i. c. 14.</NOTE> the crews of which rushed forward with impetuous valour, but little art, to board those of the enemy. In the war of Pelo∣ponnesus, their ships seem still to have been of in∣considerable burthen and force. The extent of their trade, how highly soever it may have been estimated in ancient times, was in proportion to this low condition of their marine. The maritime states of Greece hardly carried on any commerce beyond the limits of the Mediterranean sea. Their chief intercourse was with the colonies of their countrymen, planted in the lesser Asia, in Italy and Sicily. They sometimes visited the ports of Egypt, of the southern provinces of Gaul, and of Thrace; or passing through the Hellespont, they traded with the countries situated around the Euxine sea. Amazing instances occur of their ignorance even of those countries which lay within the narrow precincts to which their navigation was confined. When the Greeks had assembled their combined fleet against Xerxes at Egina, they thought it un∣advisable to sail to Samos, because they believed the distance between that island and Egina to be as great as the distance between Egina and the Pillars of Hercules<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Heredot. lib. viii. c. 132.</NOTE>. They were either utterly unac∣quainted with all the parts of the globe beyond the Mediterranean sea, or what knowledge they had of them was founded on conjecture, or derived from the information of a few persons, whom curiosity
<PB N="50" REF="034476_0048_0FFDD4A6E6348868"/>
and the love of science had prompted to travel by land into the Upper Asia, or by sea into Egypt, the ancient seats of wisdom and arts. After all that the Greeks learned from them, they appear to have been ignorant of the most important facts on which an accurate and scientific knowledge of the globe is founded.</P>
<P>THE expedition of Alexander the Great into the east, considerably enlarged the sphere of naviga∣tion and of geographical knowledge among the Greeks. That extraordinary man, notwithstanding the violent passions which incited him, at some times, to the wildest actions, and the most extra∣vagant enterprises, possessed talents which fitted him not only to conquer, but to govern the world. He was capable of framing those bold and original schemes of policy, which gave a new form to hu∣man affairs. The revolution in commerce, brought about by the force of his genius, is hardly inferior to that revolution in empire occasioned by the success of his arms. It is probable that the oppo∣sition and efforts of the republic of Tyre, which checked him so long in the career of his victories, gave Alexander an opportunity of observing the vast resources of a maratime power, and conveyed to him some idea of the immense wealth which the Tyrians derived from their commerce, especially that with the East-Indies. As soon as he had ac∣complished the destruction of Tyre, and reduced Egypt to subjection, he formed the plan of ren∣dering the empire which he proposed to establish, the center of commerce as well as the seat of do∣minion. With this view he founded a great city, which he honoured with his own name, near one of the mouths of the river Nile, that, by the Medi∣terranean sea, and the neighbourhood of the Ara∣bian Gulf, it might command the trade both of the east and west<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strab. Geogr. lib. xvii. p. 1143. 1249.</NOTE>. This situation was chosen with
<PB N="51" REF="034476_0049_0FFDD4A97805D7B8"/>
such discernment, that Alexandria soon became the chief commercial city in the world. Not only during the subsistence of the Grecian empire in Egypt and in the east, but amidst all the successive revolutions in those countries, from the time of the Ptolemies to the discovery of the navigation by the Cape of Good Hope, commerce, particular∣ly that of the East-Indies, continued to flow in the channel which the sagacity and foresight of Alexander had marked out for it.</P>
<P>HIS ambition was not satisfied with having open∣ed to the Greeks a communication with India by sea; he aspired to the sovereignty of those regions which furnished the rest of mankind with so many precious commodities, and conducted his army thither by land. Enterprising, however, as he was, he may be said rather to have viewed, than to have conquered that country. He did not, in his progress towards the east, advance beyond the banks of the rivers that fall into the Indus, which is now the western boundary of the vast continent of India. Amidst the wild exploits which distin∣guish this part of his history, he pursued mea∣sures that mark the superiority of his genius, as well as the extent of his views. He had penetrated as far into India as to con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m his opinion of its commercial importan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and to perceive that im∣mense wealth might be derived from intercourse with a country, where the arts of elegance having been more early cultivated, were arrived at greater perfection than in any other part of the earth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strab. Geogr. lib. xv. p. 1036. Q. Curtius, lib. xviii. c. 9.</NOTE>. Full of this idea, he resolved to examine the course of navigation from the mouth of the Indus to the bottom of the Persian Gulf; and if it should be found practicable, to establish a regular com∣munication
<PB N="52" REF="034476_0050_0FFDD4AC0E4A8DD8"/>
between them. In order to effect this, he proposed to remove the cataracts, with which the jealousy of the Persians, and their aversion to correspondence with foreigners, had obstructed the entrance into the Euphrates;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Strab. Geogr. lib. xvi. p. 1075.</NOTE> to carry the commo∣dities of the east up that river, and the Tigris, which unites with it, into the interior parts of his Asiatic dominions; while, by the way of the Ara∣bian Gulf, and the river Nile, they might be conveyed to Alexandria, and distributed to the rest of the world, Nearchus, an officer of eminent abilities, was entrusted with the command of the fleet fitted out for this expedition. He performed this voyage, which was deemed an enterprise so arduous and important, that Alexander reckoned it one of the most extraordinary events which distin∣guished his reign. Inconsiderable as it may now appear, it was, at that time, an undertaking of no little merit and difficulty. In the prosecution of it, striking instances occur of the small progress which the Greeks had made in naval knowledge<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE IV.</NOTE>. Hav∣ing never sailed beyond the bounds of the Medi∣terranean, where the ebb and flow of the sea are hardly perceptible, when they first observed this phaenomenon at the mouth of the Indus, it ap∣peared to them a prodigy, by which the gods testi∣fied the displeasure of Heaven against their enter∣prise.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See NOTE V.</NOTE> During their whole course, they seem never to have lost sight of land, but followed the bearings of the coast so servilely, that they could not much avail themselves of those periodical winds which facilitate navigation in the Indian ocean. Accordingly, they spent no less than ten <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Plin. Hist. Nat. lib. vi. c. 23.</NOTE> months in performing this voyage, which, from the mouth
<PB N="53" REF="034476_0051_0FFDD4ADA0CD4EF0"/>
of the Indus to that of the Persian Gulf, does not exceed twenty degrees. It is probable, that amidst the violent convulsions and frequent revolutions in the East, occasioned by the contests among the successors of Alexander, the navigation to India, by the course which Nearchus had opened, was discontinued. The Indian trade carried on at Alex∣andria not only subsisted, but was so much ex∣tended under the Grecian monarchs of Egypt, that it proved a great source of the wealth which distinguished their kingdom.</P>
<P>THE progress which the Romans made in navi∣gation and discovery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Ro∣mans.</NOTE> was still more inconsiderable than that of the Greeks. The genius of the Ro∣man people, their military education, and the spi∣rit of their laws concurred in estranging them from commerce and naval affairs. It was the necessity of opposing a formidable rival, not the desire of extending trade, which first prompted them to aim at maritime power. Though they soon perceived that, in order to acquire the universal dominion after which they aspired, it was necessary to ren∣der themselves masters of the sea, they still consi∣dered the naval service as a subordinate station, and reserved for it such citizens as were not of a rank to be admitted into the legions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Polyb. lib. v.</NOTE>. In the his∣tory of the Roman republic, hardly one event oc∣curs, that marks attention to navigation any farther than as it was instrumental towards conquest. When the Roman valour and discipline had sub∣dued all the maritime states known in the ancient world; when Carthage, Greece, and Egypt had submitted to their power, the Romans did not im∣bibe the commercial spirit of the conquered na∣tions. Among that people of soldiers, to have ap∣plied to trade would have been deemed a degrada∣tion of a Roman citizen. They abandoned the me∣chanical
<PB N="54" REF="034476_0052_0FFDD4B139E50B80"/>
arts, commerce, and navigation, to slaves, to freedmen, to provincials, and to citizens of the lowest class. Even after the subversion of liberty, when the severity and haughtiness of ancient man∣ners began to abate, commerce did not rise into high estimation among the Romans. The trade of Greece, Egypt, and the other conquered coun∣tries, continued to be carried on in its usual chan∣nels, after they were reduced into the form of Ro∣man provinces. As Rome was the capital of the world, and the seat of government, all the wealth and valuable productions of the provinces flowed naturally thither. The Romans, satisfied with this, seem to have suffered commerce to remain almost entirely in the hands of the natives of the respective countries. The extent, however, of the Roman power, which reached over the greatest part of the known world, the vigilant inspection of the Roman magistrates, and the spirit of the Roman govern∣ment, no less intelligent than active, gave such ad∣ditional security to commerce, as animated it with new vigour. The union among nations was never so entire, nor the intercourse so perfect, as within the bounds of this vast empire. Commerce un∣der the Roman dominion, was not obstructed by the jealousy of rival states, interrupted by frequent hostilities, or limited by partial restrictions. One superintending power moved and regulated the in∣dustry of mankind, and enjoyed the fruits of their joint efforts.</P>
<P>NAVIGATION felt this influence, and improved under it. As soon as the Romans acquired a taste for the luxuries of the East, the trade with India through Egypt was pushed with new vigour, and carried on to greater extent. By frequenting the Indian continent, navigators became acquainted with the periodical course of the winds, which, in
<PB N="55" REF="034476_0053_0FFDD4B3D298DD40"/>
the ocean that separates Africa from India, blow with little variation during one half of the year from the east, and during the other half blow with equal steadiness from the west. Encouraged by observ∣ing this, the pilots who sailed from Egypt to India abandoned their ancient slow and dangerous course along the coast, and as soon as the western monsoon set in, took their departure from Ocelis, at the mouth of the Arabian Gulf, and stretched boldly across the ocean <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. vi. c. 23.</NOTE>. The uniform direction of the wind supplying the place of the compass, and ren∣dering the guidance of the stars less necessary, con∣ducted them to the port of Musiris, on the western shore of the Indian continent. There they took on board their cargo, and returning with the eastern monsoon, finished their voyage to the Arabian Gulf within the year. This part of India, now known by the name of the Malabar coast, seems to have been the utmost limit of ancient navigation in that quarter of the globe. What imperfect knowledge the ancients had of the immense countries which stretch beyond this towards the east, they received from a few adventurers, who had visited them by land. Such excursions were neither frequent nor extensive, and it is probable, that while the Roman intercourse with India subsisted, no traveller ever penetrated farther than to the banks of the Ganges.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strab. Georgr. lib. xv. p. 1006. 1010. See NOTE VI.</NOTE> The fleets from Egypt which traded at Musiris were loaded, it is true, with the spices and other rich com∣modites of the continent and islands of the farther India; but these were brought to that port, which became the staple of the commerce between the East and West, by the Indians themselves, in canoes hol∣lowed out of one tree<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Plin.

merchants, satisfied with acquiring those commodities in this manner, did not think it necessary to explore unknown seas, and venture upon a dangerous navi∣gation in quest of the countries which produced them. But though the discoveries of the Romans in India were so limited, their commerce there was such as will appear considerable, even to the present age, in which the Indian trade has been extended far beyond the practice or conception of any preced∣ing period. We are informed by one autho of cre∣dit, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plin. Nat. Hist. lib. vi. c. 26.</NOTE> that the commerce with India draned the Ro∣man empire every year of more than four hundred thousand pounds; and by another, that one hundred and twenty ships sailed annually from the Arabian Gulf to that country<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strab.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Discoveries of the an∣cients by land.</NOTE>THE discovery of this new method of sailing to In∣dia, is the most considerable improvement in navi∣gation made during the continuance of the Roman power.

The progress, however, of their victorious armies through a considerable portion of Europe, Asia, and Afri∣ca, contributed greatly to extend discovery by land, and gradually opened the navigation of new and unknown seas. Previous to the Roman con∣quests, the civilized nations of antiquity had little communication with those countries in Europe, which now form its most opulent and powerful kingdoms. The interior parts of Spain and Gaul were imperfectly known. Britain, separated from the rest of the world, had never been visited, ex∣cept
<PB N="57" REF="034476_0055_0FFDD4B902D9A8F8"/>
by its neighbours the Gauls, and by a few Carthaginian merchants. The name of Germany had scarcely been heard of. Into all these coun∣tries the arms of the Romans penetrated. They entirely subdued Spain and Gaul; they conquered the greatest and most fertile part of Britain; they advanced into Germany, as far as the banks of the river Elbe. In Africa, they acquired a considera∣ble knowledge of the provinces which stretch along the Mediterranean sea, from Egypt westward to the straits of Gades. In Asia, they not only sub∣jected to their power most of the provinces which composed the Prussian and Macedonian empires, but, after their victories over Mithridates and Ti∣granes, they seem to have made a more accurate survey of the countries contiguous to the Euxine and Caspian seas, and to have carried on a more extensive trade than that of the Greeks with the opulent and commercial nations, then seated round the Euxine sea.</P>
<P>FROM this succinct survey of discovery and navi∣gation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Imperfec∣tion of ge∣ographical knowledge among the ancients.</NOTE> which I have traced from the earliest dawn of historical knowledge to the full establishment of the Roman dominion, the progress of both ap∣pears to have been wonderfully slow. It seems neither adequate to what we might have expected from the activity and enterprise of the human mind, nor to what might have been performed by the power of the great empires which successively go∣verned the world. If we reject accounts that are fabulous and obscure; if we adhere steadily to the light and information of authentic history, with∣out substituting in its place the conjectures of fancy, or the dreams of etymologists, we must conclude, that the knowledge which the ancients had ac∣quired of the habitable globe was extremely con∣fined. In Europe, the extensive provinces in the eastern part of Germany were little known to them.
<PB N="58" REF="034476_0056_0FFDD4BACE4D9F00"/>
They were almost totally unacquainted with the vast countries which are now subject to the Kings of Denmark, Sweden, Prussia, Poland, and the Russian empire. The more barren regions, that stretch within the arctic circle, were quite unex∣plored. In Africa, their researches did not extend far beyond the provinces which border on the Me∣diterranean, and those situated on the western shore of the Arabian Gulf. In Asia, they were unacquainted, as I formerly observed, with all the fertile and opulent countries beyond the Ganges, which furnish the most valuable commodities that, in modern times, have been the great object of the European commerce with India; nor do they seem to have ever penetrated into those immense regions occupied by the wandering tribes which they called by the general name of Sarmatians or Scythians, and which are now possessed by Tartars of various denominations, and by the Asiatic subjects of Russia.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A remar∣kable proof of this.</NOTE>BUT there is one opinion, that universally pre∣vailed among the ancients, which conveys a more striking idea of the small progress they had made in the knowledge of the habitable globe, than can be derived from any detail of their discoveries. They supposed the earth to be divided into five regions, which they distinguished by the name of zones. Two of these, which were nearest the poles, they termed frigid zones, and believed that the extreme cold which reigned perpetually there, rendered them uninhabitable. Another, seated under the line, and extending on either side towards the tropics, they called the torrid zone, and imagined it to be so burnt up with unremitting heat, as to be equally destitute of inhabitants. On the two other zones, which occupied the remainder of the earth, they bestowed the appellation of temperate, and taught that these, being the only regions in which life
<PB N="59" REF="034476_0057_0FFDD4BF70B58738"/>
could subsist, were allotted to man for his habitation. This wild opinion was not a conceit of the unin∣formed vulgar, or a fanciful fiction of the poets, but a system adopted by the most enlightened phi∣losophers, the most accurate historians and geo∣graphers, in Greece and Rome According to this theory, a vast portion of the habitable earth was pronounced to be unsit for sustaining the hu∣man species. Those fertile and populous regions within the torrid zone, which are now known not only to yield their own inhabitants the necessaries and comforts of life, with most luxuriant profu∣sion, but to communicate their superfluous stores to the rest of the world, were supposed to be the mansion of perpetual sterility and desolation. As all the parts of the globe with which the ancients were acquainted, lay within the northern temperate zone, their opinion that the other temperate zone was filled with inhabitants, was founded on reason∣ing and conjecture, not on discovery. They even believed that, by the intolerable heat of the torrid zone, such an insuperable barrier was placed be∣tween the two temperate regions of the earth, as would prevent for ever any intercourse between their respective inhabitants. Thus this extrava∣gant theory not only proves that the ancients were unacquainted with the true state of the globe, but it tended to render their ignorance perpetual, by representing all attempts towards opening a com∣munication with the remote regions of the earth, as utterly impracticable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE VIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT, however imperfect or inaccurate the geo∣graphical knowledge which the Greeks and Ro∣mans had acquired may appear, in respect of the present improved state of that science, their progress in discovery will seem considerable, and the ex∣tent

to which they carried navigation and commerce must be reckoned great, when compared with the ignorance of early times. As long as the Roman empire retained such vigour as to preserve its au∣thority over the conquered nations, and to keep them united, it was an object of public police, as well as of private curiosity, to examine and de∣scribe the countries which composed this great body. Even when the other sciences began to de∣cline, geography, enriched with new observations, and receiving some accession from the experience of every age, and the reports of every traveller continued to improve. It attained to the highest point of perfection and accuracy to which it ever arrived in the ancient world, by the industry and genius of Ptolemy the philosopher.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Improve∣ments in geography by Ptole∣my.</NOTE> He flour∣ished in the second century of the Christian aera, and published a description of the terreftri∣al globe, more ample and exact than that of any of his predecessors.</P>

During this decline and old age of the Roman state, it was impossible that the sciences should go on improving.

Europe, when occupied by such in∣habitants, may be said to have returned to a second infancy, and had to begin anew its career in im∣provement, science, and civility. The first effect of the settlement of those barbarous invaders was to dissolve the union by which the Roman power had cemented mankind together. They parcelled out Europe into many small and independent states, differing from each other in language and customs.

Constantinople, though often threatened by the fierce invaders, who spread desolation over the rest of Europe, was so fortunate as to escape their destructive rage. In that city, the knowledge of ancient arts and discoveries was preserved; a taste for splendour and elegance subsisted; the produc∣tions and luxuries of foreign countries were in re∣quest; and commerce continued to flourish there when it was almost extinct in every other part of Europe. The citizens of Constantinople did not confine their trade to the islands of the Archipelago, or to the adjacent coasts of Asia; they took a wider range, and following the course which the ancients had marked out, imported the commodi∣ties of the East Indies from Alexandria. When Egypt was torn from the Roman empire by the Arabians, the industry of the Greeks discovered a new channel, by which the productions of India might be conveyed to Constantinople. They were carried up the Indus, as far as that great river is navigable; thence they were transported by land to the banks of the river Oxus, and proceeded down its stream to the Caspian sea. There they en∣tered the Volga, and sailing up it, were carried by land to the Tanais, which conducted them into the Euxine sea, where vessels from Constantinople wait∣ed their arrival.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ramusio, vol. i. p. 372, F.</NOTE> This extraordinary and tedious mode of conveyance merits attention, not only as

a proof of the violent passion which the inhabitants of Constantinople had conceived for the luxuries of the east, and as a specimen of the ardour and ingenuity with which they carried on commerce; but because it demonstrates, that, during the igno∣rance which reigned in the rest of Europe, an ex∣tensive knowledge of remote countries was still preserved in the capital of the Greek empire.</P>
<P>AT the same time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and among the Arabi∣ans.</NOTE> a gleam of light and know∣ledge broke in upon the east. The Arabians having contracted some relish for the sciences of the peo∣ple, whose empire they had contributed to over∣turn, translated the books of several of the Greek philosophers into their own language. One of the first, was that valuable work of Ptolemy, which I have already mentioned. The study of geography became, of consequence, an early object of atten∣tion to the Arabians. But that acute and ingenious people cultivated chiefly the speculative and scientific parts of geography. In order to ascertain the figure and dimensions of the terrestrial globe, they ap∣plied the principles of geometry, they had recourse to astronomical observations, they employed expe∣riments and operations, which, Europe, in more enlightened times, has been proud to adopt and to imitate. At that period, however, the fame of the improvements made by the Arabians did not reach Europe.

The first symp∣toms
<PB N="64" REF="034476_0062_0FFDD4CA5F33D6B8"/>
of revival were discerned in Italy. The northern tribes, which took possession of this coun∣try, made progress <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> improvement with greater rapidity than the people settled in other parts of Europe. Various causes, which it is not the object of this work to enumerate or explain, concurred in restoring liberty and independence to the cities of Italy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Charles V. vol. i. p. 33.</NOTE>. The acquisition of these roused indus∣try, and gave motion and vigour to all the active powers of the human mind. Foreign commerce revived, navigation was attended to and improved. Constantinople became the chief mart to which the Italians resorted. There they not only met with a favourable reception, but obtained such mercantile privileges as enabled them to carry on trade with great advantage. They were supplied both with the precious commodities of the east, and with many curious manufactures, the product of ancient arts and ingenuity which still subsisted among the Greeks. As the labour and expence of conveying the productions of India to Constantinople by that long and indirect course which I have described, rendered them extremely rare, and of an exorbitant price, the industry of the Italians discovered other methods of procuring them in greater abundance, and at an easier rate. They sometimes purchased them in Aleppo, Tripoli, and other ports on the coast of Syria, to which they were brought by a route not unknown to the ancients. They were con∣veyed from India by sea, up the Persian Gulf, and ascending the Euphrates and Tigris, as far as Bag∣dat, were carried by land across the desart of Pal∣myra, and from thence to the towns on the Medi∣terranean. But from the length of the journey, and the dangers to which the caravans were exposed, this proved always a tedious, and often a precarious mode of conveyance. At length, the Soldans of

Egypt, having revived the commerce with India in its ancient channel, by the Arabian Gulf, the Italian merchants, notwithstanding the violent antipathy to each other with which Christians and the followers of Mahomet were then possessed, repaired to Alex∣a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and enduring, from the love of gain, the insolence and exactions of the Mahometans, esta∣blished a lucrative trade in that port. From that period, the commercial spirit of Italy became active and enterprising. Venice, Genoa, Pisa, rose from inconsiderable towns, to be populous and wealthy cities. Their naval power increased; their vessels frequented not only all the ports in the Mediterra∣nean, but venturing sometimes beyond the Streights, visited the maritime towns of Spain, France, the Low Countries, and England; and, by distributing their commodities over Europe, began to commu∣nicate to its various nations some taste for the valu∣able productions of the east, as well as some ideas of manufactures and arts, which were then un∣known beyond the precincts of Italy.</P>
<P>WHILE the cities of Italy were thus advancing in their career of improvement,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pro∣gress fa∣voured by the Cru∣sades.</NOTE> an event happen∣ed, the most extraordinary perhaps in the history of mankind, which, instead of retarding the com∣mercial progress of the Italians, rendered it more rapid. The martial spirit of the Europeans, height∣ened and imflamed by religious zeal, prompted them to attempt the deliverance of the Holy Land from the dominion of Infidels. Vast armies, com∣posed of all the nations in Europe, marched to∣wards Asia, upon this wild enterprise. The Ge∣noese, the Pisans, and Venitians furnished the trans∣ports which carried them thither. They supplied them with provisions and military stores. Beside the immense sums which they received on this ac∣count, they obtained commercial privileges and establishments, of great consequence in the settle∣ments

which the Crusaders made in Palestine, and in other provinces of Asia. From those sources, prodigious wealth flowed into the cities which I have mentioned. This was accompanied with a proportional increase of power, and, by the end of the Holy War, Venice, in particular, became a great maritime state, possessing an extensive com∣merce, and ample territories<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Essai de l'Histoire du Commerce de Venise, p. 52, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Italy was not the only country in which the Crusades contributed to revive and diffuse such a spirit as prepared Europe for future discoveries. By their expeditions into Asia, the other European nations became well ac∣quainted with remote regions, which formerly they knew only by name, or by the reports of ignorant and credulous pilgrims. They had an opportunity of observing the manners, the arts, and the ac∣modations of people more polished than themselves. This intercourse between the east and west sub∣sisted almost two centuries. The adventurers, who returned from Asia, communicated to their coun∣trymen the ideas which they had acquired, and the habits of life they had contracted by visiting more refined nations. The Europeans began to be sen∣sible of wants with which they were formerly unac∣quainted: new desires were excited; and such a taste for the commodities and arts of other coun∣tries gradually spread among them, that they not only encouraged the resort of foreigners to their harbours, but began to perceive the advantage and necessity of applying to commerce themselves<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Charles V. vol. i. p. 25, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>

The wild fanaticism, which seems at that period to have mingled in all the schemes of individuals, no less than in all the counsels of nations, first incited men to enter upon those long and dangerous peregrina∣tions. They were afterwards undertaken from prospects of commercial advantage, or from mo∣tives of mere curiosity.

From thence he took his route towards the south, and after tra∣versing various provinces of the farther India, he embarked on the Indian ocean, visited several of its Islands, and returned at the end of thirteen years by the way of Egypt, to Europe, with much in∣formation concerning a large district of the globe, altogether unknown at that time to the western world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bergeron Recueil des Voyages, &amp;c. tom. i. p. 1.</NOTE>.

The haughty descendant of the greatest conqueror Asia had ever beheld, astonished at this strange mandate from an Italian priest, whose name and jurisdiction where alike unknown to him, received it with the contempt which it merited, though he dismissed the mendicants who delivered it with im∣punity. But, as they had penetrated into the country by different routes, and followed for some time the Tartar camps, which were always in motion, they had opportunity of visiting a great part of Asia. Carpini, who proceeded by the way of Poland and Russia, travelled through its nor∣thern provinces as far as the extremities of Thibet.

William de Rubruquis, a Franciscan. With respect to the progress of the former, there is no memorial extant. The journal of the latter has been published. He was admitted into the presence of Mangu, the third Khan in succession from Zengis, and made a circuit through the interior parts of Asia, more ex∣tensive than that of any European who had hi∣therto explored them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hakl. i. 71.

<P>TO those travellers, whom religious zeal sent forth to visit Asia, succeeded others who ventured into remote countries, from the prospect of com∣mercial advantage, or from motives of mere curi∣osity.

<P>AS his father had already carried some European commodities to the court of the great Chan of the Tartars, and had disposed of them to advantage, he resorted thither. Under the protection of Kub∣lay Chan, the most powerful of all the successors of Zengis, he continued his mercantile peregri∣nations in Asia, upwards of twenty-six years; and, during that time, advanced towards the east, far beyond the utmost boundaries to which any Euro∣pean traveller had ever proceeded. Instead of fol∣lowing the course of Carpini and Rubruquis, along the vast unpeopled plains of Tartary, he passed
<PB N="70" REF="034476_0068_0FFDD4DA5B323820"/>
through the chief trading cities in the more culti∣vated parts of Asia, and penetrated to Cambalu, or Peking, the capital of the great kingdom of Cathay, or China, subject at that time to the suc∣cessors of Zengis. He made more than one voyage, on the Indian ocean, he traded in many of the islands, from which Europe had long received spiceries and other commodities, which it held in high estimation, though unacquainted with the par∣ticular countries to which it was indebted for those precious productions; and he obtained information concerning several countries, which he did not visit in person, particularly the island Zipangri, pro∣bably the same now known by the name of Japan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vigaggi di Marco Polo.

On his return, he astonished his contemporaries with his descriptions of vast regions, whose names had never been heard of in Europe, and with such pompous accounts of their fertility, their popu∣lousness, their opulence, the variety of their ma∣nufactures, and the extent of their trade, as rose far above the conception of an uninformed age.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1322.</NOTE>ABOUT half a century after Marco Polo, Sir John Mandeville, an Englishman, encouraged by his example, visited most of the countries in the east which he had described, and, like him, pub∣lished an account of them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyages and Travels, by Sir John Mandeville.</NOTE>. The narrations of those early travellers abound with many wild inco∣herent tales concerning giants, enchanters, and monsters. But they were not, from that circum∣stance, less acceptable to an ignorant age, which delighted in what was marvellous. The wonders which they told, mostly on hearsay, filled the mul∣titude with admiration. The facts which they re∣lated from their own observation, attracted the at∣tention of the more discerning. The former, which
<PB N="71" REF="034476_0069_0FFDD4DEF70EB618"/>
may be considered as the popular traditions and fables of the countries through which they had passed, were gradually disregarded as Europe ad∣vanced in knowledge. The latter, however incre∣dible some of them may have appeared in their own time, have been confirmed by the obser∣vations of modern travellers. By means of both, however, the curiosity of mankind was excited with respect to the remote parts of the earth, their ideas were enlarged, and they were not only insen∣sibly disposed to attempt new discoveries, but re∣ceived such information as directed to that parti∣cular course in which these were afterwards carried on.</P>
<P>WHILE this spirit was gradually forming in Eu∣rope, a fortunate discovery was made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and by the invention of the man∣ne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> com∣pass</NOTE> which con∣tributed more than all the efforts and ingenuity of preceding ages, to improve and to extend naviga∣tion. That wonderful property of the magnet, by which it communicates such virtue to a needle o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> slender rod of iron, as to point towards the poles of the earth, was observed. The use which might be made of this in directing navigation was imme∣diately perceived. That valuable, but now familiar instrument, the mariner's compass, was construct∣ed. When, by means of it, navigators found that, at all seasons, and in every place, they could dis∣cover the north and south with so <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch ease and accuracy, it became no longer necessary to depend merely on the light of the stars and the observa∣tion of the sea coast. They gradually abandoned their ancient timid and lingering course along the shore, ventured boldly into the ocean, and relying on this new guide, could steer in the darkest night, and under the most cloudy sky, with a security and precision hitherto unknown. The compass may be said to have opened to man the dominion of the sea, and to have put him in full posses∣sion
<PB N="72" REF="034476_0070_0FFDD4E08AAA8B88"/>
of the earth, by enabling him to visit every part of it. Flavio Gioia, a citizen of Amalfi, a town of considerable trade in the kingdom of Na∣ples, was the author of this great discovery, about the year one thousand three hundred and two. It hath been often the fate of those illustrious bene∣factors of mankind, who have enriched science and improved the arts by their inventions to de∣rive more reputation than benefit from the happy efforts of their genius. But the lot of Gioia has been still more cruel; through the inattention or ignorance of contemporary historians, he has been defrauded even of the same to which he had such a just title. We receive from them no information with respect to his profession, his character, the precise time when he made this important discovery, or the accidents and inquiries which led to it. The knowledge of this event, though productive of greater effects than any recorded in the annals of the human race, is transmitted to us without any of those circumstances, which can gratify the cu∣riosity that it naturally awakens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collinas &amp; Trombellus de Acus nauticae Inventore. Instit. Acad. Bonon. tom. ii. part iii. p. 372.</NOTE>. But though the use of the compass might enable the Italians to perform the short voyages to which they were ac∣customed with greater security and expedition, its influence was not so sudden or extensive, as imme∣diately to render navigation adventurous, and to excite a spirit of discovery. Many causes com∣bined in preventing this beneficial invention from producing its full effect instantaneously. Men re∣linquish ancient habits slowly, and with reluctance. They are averse to new experiments, and venture upon them with timidity. The commercial <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea∣lousy of the Italians, it is probable, laboured to conceal the happy discovery of their countryman
<PB N="73" REF="034476_0071_0FFDD4E353EB78D8"/>
from other nations. The art of steering by the compass with such skill and accuracy as to inspire a full confidence in its direction, was acquired gra∣dually. Sailors, unaccustomed to quit sight of land, durst not launch out at once and commit themselves to unknown seas. Accordingly, near half a century elapsed from the time of Gioia's dis∣covery, before navigators ventured into any seas which they had not been accustomed to frequent.</P>
<P>THE first appearance of a bolder spirit may be dated from the voyages of the Spaniards to the Canary or Fortunate Islands.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some ap∣pearance of a bolder spirit in na∣vigation.</NOTE> By what accident they were led to the discovery of those small isles, which lie near five hundred miles from the Spanish coast, and above a hundred and fifty miles from the coast of Africa, contemporary writers have not explained.

Clement VI. in virtue of the right claimed by the holy see, to dispose of all countries possessed by infidels, erected those isles into a king∣dom, in the year one thousand three hundred and forty-four, and conferred it on Lewis de la Cerda, descended from the royal family of Castile. But that unfortunate prince, destitute of power to as∣sert his nominal title, having never visited the Ca∣naries, John de Bethencourt, a Norman baron, obtained a grant of them from Henry III. of Cas∣tile<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Viera y Clavijo Notic. de la Histor. de Canaria.

In a general survey of the progress of discovery, it is sufficient to have mentioned this event; and leaving it among those of dubious ex∣istence, or of small importance, we may conclude, that though much additional information concern∣ing the remote regions of the East had been re∣ceived by travellers who visited them by land, na∣vigation, at the beginning of the fifteenth century, had not advanced beyond the state to which it had attained before the downfal of the Roman em∣pire.</P>

<P>VARIOUS circumstances prompted the Portu∣guese to exert their activity in this new direction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Circum∣stances which led to this.</NOTE> and enabled them to accomplish undertakings ap∣parently superior to the natural force of their mo∣narchy. The kings of Portugal, having driven the Moors out of their dominions, had acquired power, as well glory, by the success of their arms against the infidels. By their victories over them, they had extended the royal authority be∣yond the narrow limits within which it was ori∣ginally circumscribed in Portugal, as well as in other feudal kingdoms. They had the command of the national force, could rouse it to act with united vigour, and, after the expulsion of the Moors, could employ it without dread of inter∣ruption from any domestic enemy. By the perpe∣tual hostilities carried on for several centuries against the Mahometans, the martial and adventurous spirit which distinguished all the European nations during the middle ages, was improved and height∣ened among the Portuguese. A fierce civil war towards the close of the fourteenth century, occa∣sioned by a disputed succession, augmented the mili∣tary ardour of the nation, and formed or called forth men of such active and daring genius, as are
<PB N="76" REF="034476_0074_0FFDD4EB1AA61CF0"/>
fit for bold undertakings. The situation of the kingdom, bounded on every side by the dominions of a more powerful neighbour, did not afford free scope to the activity of the Portuguse by land, as the strength of their monarchy was no match for that of Castile. But Portugal was a maritime state, in which there were many commodious har∣bours; the people had begun to make some progress in the knowledge and practice of navigation; and the sea was open to them, presenting the only field of enterprise in which they could distinguish them∣selves.</P>

He in∣stantly perceived that it would be impossible to preserve public order, or domestic tranquility, without finding some employment for the restless spirit of his subjects. With this view he assembled a numerous fleet at Lisbon, composed of all the ships which he could fit out in his own kingdom, and of many hired from foreigners.

The works of the an∣cient Greeks and Romans began to be read with admiration and profit. The sciencies cultivated by the Arabians were introduced into Europe by the Moors settled in Spain and Portugal, and by the Jews, who were very numerous in both these kingdoms. Geometry, astronomy, and geography, the sciences on which the art of navigation is founded, became objects of studious attention. The memory of the discoveries made by the an∣cients was revived, and the progress of their navi∣gation and commerce began to be traced.

proved successful. The vessels sent on the disco∣very doubled that formidable Cape, which had terminated the progress of former navigators, and proceeded a hundred and sixty miles beyond it, to Cape Bojador. As its rocky cliffs, which stretched a considerable way into the Atlantic, ap∣peared more dreadful than the promontory which they had passed, the Portuguese commanders durst not attempt to sail round it, but returned to Lisbon, more satisfied with having advanced so far, than ashamed of having ventured no farther.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince Henry the director of the Portu∣guese dis∣coveries.</NOTE>INCONSIDERABLE as this voyage was, it in∣creased the passion for discovery, which began to arise in Portugal. The fortunate issue of the king's expedition against the Moors of Barbary, added strength to that spirit in the nation, and pushed it on to new undertakings.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1417.</NOTE> In order to render these successful, it was necessary that they should be con∣ducted by a person who possessed abilities capable of discerning what was attainable, who enjoyed leisure to form a regular system for prosecuting discovery, and who was animated with ardour that would persevere in spite of obstacles and repulses. Happily for Portugal, she found all those qualities in Henry Duke of Viseo, the fourth son of king John by Philippa of Lancaster, sister of Henry IV. king of England. That prince, in his early youth, having accompanied his father in his expedition to Barbary, distinguished himself by many deeds of valour. To the martial spirit, which was the cha∣racteristic of every man of noble birth at that time, he added all the accomplishments of a more enlightened and polished age. He cultivated the arts and sciences, which were then unknown and despised by persons of his rank. He applied with peculiar fondness to the study of geography; and by the instruction of able masters, as well as by the accounts of travellers, he early acquired such know∣ledge

of the habitable globe, as discovered the great probability of finding new and opulent coun∣tries, by sailing along the coast of Africa. Such an object was formed to awaken the enthusiasm and ardour of a youthful mind, and he espoused with the utmost zeal the patronage of a design which might prove as beneficial, as it appeared to be splendid and honourable. In order that he might pursue this great scheme without interrup∣tion, he retired from court immediately after his return from Africa, and fixed his residence at Sa∣gres, near Cape St. Vincent, where the prospect of the Atlantic ocean invited his thoughts continually towards his favourite project, and encouraged him to execute it. In this retreat he was attended by some of the most learned men in his country, who aided him in his researches. He applied for in∣formation to the Moors of Barbary, who were ac∣customed to travel by land into the interior pro∣vinces of Africa, in quest of ivory, gold-dust, and other rich commodities. He consulted the Jews settled in Portugal. By promises, rewards, and marks of respect, he allured into his service several persons, foreigners as well as Portuguese, who were eminent for their skill in navigation. In taking those preparatory steps, the great abilities of the prince were seconded by his private virtues. His integrity, his affability, his respect for religion, his zeal for the honour of his country, engaged per∣sons of all ranks to applaud his design, and to fa∣vour the execution of it. His schemes were al∣lowed by the greater part of his countrymen to proceed neither from ambition nor the desire of wealth, but to flow from the warm benevolence of a heart eager to promote the happiness of mankind, and which justly entitled him to assume a motto for his device, that described the quality, by which he wished to be distinguished, the talent of doing good.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="034476_0078_0FFDD4F59F040C58"/>HIS first effort, as is usual at the commence∣ment of any new undertaking, was extremely in∣considerable.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovery of Porto Santo; 1418.</NOTE> He fitted out a single ship, and giving the command or it to John Gonzalez Zarco and Tristan Vaz, two gentlemen of his household, who voluntarily offered to conduct the enterprise, he instructed them to use their utmost efforts to double Cape Bojador, and thence to steer towards the south. They, according to the mode of navi∣gation which still prevailed, held their course along the shore; and by following that direction, they must have encountered almost insuperable difficulties in attempting to pass Cape Bojador. But fortune came in aid to their want of skill, and prevented the voyage from being altogether fruit∣less. A sudden squall of wind arose, drove them out to sea, and when they expected every moment to perish, landed them on an unknown island, which from their happy escape they named <HI>Porto Santo.</HI> In the infancy of navigation, the discovery of this small island appeared a matter of such moment, that they instantly returned to Por∣tugal with the good tidings, and were received by Henry with the applause and honour due to for∣tunate adventurers. This faint dawn of success filled a mind ardent in the pursuit of a favourite object with such sanguine hopes as were sufficient incitement to proceed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1419.</NOTE> Next year, Henry sent out three ships under the same commanders, to whom he joined Bartholomew Perestrello, in order to take possession of the island which they had discovered.

As it was Henry's chief object to render his discoveries useful to his country, he immediately equipped a fleet to carry a colony of Portuguese to these islands. By his provident care,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1420.</NOTE> they were furnished not only with the seeds, plants, and do∣mestic animals common in Europe; but as he foresaw that the warmth of the climate and fer∣tility of the soil would prove favourable to the rearing of other productions, he procured slips of the vine from the island of Cyprus, the rich wines of which were then in great request, and plants of the sugar-cane from Sicily, into which it had been lately introduced These throve so prosperously in this new country, that the benefit of cultivating them was immediately perceived, and the sugar and wine of Madeira quickly became articles of some consequence in the commerce of Portu∣gal<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lud.

<P>AS soon as the advantages derived from this first settlement to the west of the European continent began to be felt, the spirit of discovery appeared less chimerical, and became more adventurous. By their voyages to Madeira, ths Portuguese were gradually accustomed to a bolder navigation, and instead of creeping servilely along the coast,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Double Cape Boja∣dor.</NOTE> ven∣tured into the open sea. In consequence of taking this course, Gilianez, who commanded one of Prince Henry's ships doubled Cape Bojador, the boundary of the Portuguese navigation upwards of twenty years, and which had hitherto been deemed unpassable. This successful voyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1433.</NOTE> which the ignorance of the age placed on a level with the most famous exploits recorded in history, opened a new sphere to navigation, as it discovered the vast continent of Africa, still washed by the Atlantic

ocean, and stretching towards the south. Part of this was soon explored; the Portuguese advanced within the tropics,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advance within the tropics.</NOTE> and in the space of a few years they discovered the river Senegal, and all the coast extending from Cape Blanco to Cape de Verd.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Astonished at what they disco∣vered there.</NOTE>HITHERTO the Portuguese had been guided in their discoveries, or encouraged to attempt them, by the light and information which they received from the works of the ancient mathematicians and geographers. But, when they began to enter the torrid zone, the notion which prevailed among the ancients, that the heat which reigned perpetually there, was so excessive as to render it uninhabit∣able, deterred them, for some time, from proceed∣ing. Their own observations, when they first ventured into this unknown and formidable region, tended to confirm the opinion of antiquity con∣cerning the violent operation of the direct rays of the sun. As far as the river Senegal, the Portu∣guese had found the coast of Africa inhabited by people nearly resembling the Moors of Barbary. When they advanced to the south of that river, the human form seemed to put on a new appear∣ance. They beheld men with skins black as ebony, with short curled hair, flat noses, thick lips, and all the peculiar features which are now known to distinguish the race of negroes. This surprising alteration they naturally attributed to the influence of heat, and if they should advance nearer to the line, they began to dread that its effects would be still more violent. Those dangers were exaggerated, and many other objections against attempting farther discoveries were pro∣posed by some of the grandees, who, from igno∣rance, from envy, or from that cold timid pru∣dence which rejects whatever has the air of novelty or enterprise, had hitherto condemned all prince Henry's schemes. They represented, that it was
<PB N="83" REF="034476_0081_0FFDD4FC78F47990"/>
altogether chimerical to expect any advantage from countries situated in that region which the wisdom and experience of antiquity had pronounced to be unfit for the habitation of men; that their fore∣fathers, satisfied with cultivating the territory which Providence had allotted them, did not waste the strength of the kingdom by fruitless projects, in quest of new settlements; that Portugal was already exhausted by the expence of attempts to discover lands which either did not exist, or which nature destined to remain unknown; and was drained of men, who might have been employed in undertakings attended with more certain success, and productive of greater benefit. But neither their appeal to the authority of the ancients, nor their reasonings concerning the interests of Portugal, made any impression upon the determined phi∣losophic mind of Prince Henry. The discoveries which he had already made convinced him that the ancients had little more than a conjectural knowledge of the torrid zone. He was no less satisfied that the political arguments of his oppo∣nents with respect to the interest of Portugal were malevolent and ill founded. In those sentiments he was strenuously supported by his brother Pedro, who governed the kingdom as guardian of their nephew Alphonso V.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1438.</NOTE> who had succeeded to the throne during his minority; and instead of slack∣ening his efforts, Henry continued to pursue his discoveries with fresh ardour.</P>
<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Papal grant to Portugal of what countries it should dis∣cover.</NOTE> in order to silence all the murmurs of opposition, he endeavoured to obtain the sanction of the highest authority in favour of his operations. With this view, he applied to the Pope, and re∣presented in pompous terms, the pious and un∣wearied zeal, with which he had exerted himself during twenty years, in discovering unknown countries, the wretched inhabitants of which were
<PB N="84" REF="034476_0082_0FFDD5001DD40C20"/>
utter strangers to true religion, wandering in hea∣then darkness, or led astray by the delusions of Mahomet. He besought the holy father, to whom, as the vicar of Christ, all the kingdoms of the earth were subject, to confer on the crown of Portugal a right to all the countries possessed by Infidels, which should be discovered by the in∣dustry of its subjects, and subdued by the force of its arms. He intreated him to enjoin all Christian powers, under the highest penalties, not to molest Portugal while engaged in this laudable enterprise, and to prohibit them from settling in any of the countries which the Portuguese should discover. He promised that, in all their expeditions, it should be the chief object of his countrymen to spread the knowledge of the Christian religion, to es∣tablish the authority of the holy see, and to in∣crease the flock of the universal pastor. As it was by improving with dexterity every favourable con∣juncture for acquiring new powers, that the court of Rome had gradually extended its usurpations, Eugine IV. the Pontiff to whom this application was made, eagerly seized the opportunity which now presented itself. He instantly perceived, that by complying with Prince Henry's request, he might exercise a prerogative no less flattering in its own nature, than likely to prove beneficial in its consequences. A bull was accordingly issued, in which, after applauding in the strongest terms the past efforts of the Portuguese, and exhorting them to proceed in that laudable career on which they had entered, he granted them an exclusive right to all the countries which they should disco∣ver, from Cape Non to the continent of India.</P>
<P>EXTRAVAGANT as this donation, comprehend∣ing such a large portion of the habitable globe, would now appear even in Catholic countries, no person in the fifteenth century doubted that the
<PB N="85" REF="034476_0083_0FFDD502B69FDB30"/>
Pope, in the plenitude of his apostolic power, had a right to confer it. Prince Henry was soon sen∣sible of the advantages which he derived from this transaction. His schemes were authorised and sanctified by the bull approving of them. The spirit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> discovery was connected with zeal for religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in that age, was a principle of such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>vity and vigour, as to influence the con∣duct of nations. All christian princes were de∣terred from intruding into those countries which the Portuguese had discovered, or from interrupting the progress of their navigation and conquests<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE X.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE fame of the Portuguese voyages soon spread over Europe. Men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fame and progress of the Portu∣guese disco∣veries.</NOTE> long accustomed to circumscribe the activity and knowledge of the human mind within the limits to which they had been hitherto confined, were astonished to behold the sphere of navigation so suddenly enlarged, and a prospect opened of visiting regions of the globe, the existence of which was unknown in former times. The learned and speculative reasoned and formed theories concerning those unexpected dis∣coveries. The vulgar inquired and wondered, while enterprising adventurers crowded from every part of Europe, soliciting Prince Henry to em∣ploy them in this honourable service. Many Ve∣netians and Genoese, in particular, who were, at that time, superior to all other nations in the science of naval affairs entered aboard the Portu∣guese ships, and acquired a more perfect and ex∣tensive knowledge of their profession in that new school of navigation. In emulation of these fo∣reigners, the Portuguese exerted their own ta∣lents. The nation seconded the designs of the prince. Private merchants formed companies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1446.</NOTE> with a view to search for unknown countries. The
<PB N="86" REF="034476_0084_0FFDD5056E948F80"/>
Cape de Verd islands, which lie off the promontory of that name, were discovered, and soon after the isles called Azores.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1449.</NOTE> As the former of these are above three hundred miles from the African coast, and the latter nine hundred miles from any conti∣nent, it is evident, by their venturing so boldly into the open seas, that the Portuguese had, by this time, improved greatly in the art of navigation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Death of P Henry. 1463.</NOTE>WHILE the passion for engaging in new under∣takings was thus warm and active, it received an unfortunate check by the death of prince Henry, whose superior knowledge had hitherto directed all the operations of the discoverers, and whose pa∣tronage had encouraged and protected them. But notwithstanding all the advantages which they derived from these, the Portuguese, during his life, did not advance, in their utmost progress towards the south, within five degrees of the equi∣noctial line; and, after their continued exertions for half a century,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From 1412 to 1463.</NOTE> hardly fifteen hundred miles of the coast of Africa were discovered. To an age acquainted with the efforts of navigation in its state of maturity and improvement, those essays of its early years must necessarily appear feeble and unskilful. But, inconsiderable as they may be deemed, they were sufficient to turn the curiosity of the European nations into a new channel, to excite an enterprising spirit, and to point the way to future discoveries.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The passion for disco∣very lan∣guishes for some time.</NOTE>ALPHONSO, who possessed the throne of Portugal at the time of Prince Henry's death, was so much engaged in supporting his own pretensions to the crown of Castile, or in carrying on his expeditions against the Moors in Barbary, that the force of his kingdom being exerted into other operations, he could not prosecute the discoveries in Africa with ardour. He committed the conduct of them to Fernando Gomez, a merchant in Lisbon, to whom
<PB N="87" REF="034476_0085_0FFDD50805BD2978"/>
he granted an exclusive right of commerce with all the countries of which prince Henry had taken possession. Under the restraint and oppression of a monopoly, the spirit of discovery languished. It ceased to be a national object, and became the concern of a private man, more attentive to his own gain, than to the glory of his country. Some progress, however, was made. The Por∣tuguese ventured at length to cross the line, and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1471.</NOTE> to their astonishment, found that region of the torrid zone, which was supposed to be scorched with intolerable heat, to be not only habitable, but populous and fertile.</P>
<P>JOHN II. who succeeded his father Alphonso,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1481. Revives with addi∣tional ardor</NOTE> possessed talents capable both of forming and exe∣cuting great designs. As part of his revenues, while prince, had arisen from duties on the trade with the newly discovered countries, this naturally turned his attention towards them, and satisfied him with respect to their utility and importance. In proportion as his knowledge of these countries extended, the possession of them appeared to be of greater consequence. While the Portuguese proceeded along the coast of Africa, from Cape Non to the river of Senegal, they sound all that extensive tract to be sandy, barren, and thinly inhabited by a wretched people, professing the Mahometan religion, and subject to the vast em∣pire of Morocco. But on the south of that river, the power and religion of the Mahometans were unknown. The country was divided into small independent principalities, the population was con∣siderable, the soil fertile<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Navigatio Aloysii Cadamusti apud Novum Orbem Grynaei, p. 2. 18.

By the acquisi∣tion
<PB N="88" REF="034476_0086_0FFDD50A991A7F98"/>
of these, commerce was enlarged, and became more adventurous. Men, animated and rendered active by the certain prospect of gain, pursued discovery with greater eagerness, than when they were excited only by curiosity and hope.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Its progress</NOTE>THIS spirit derived no small reinforcement of vigour from the countenance of such a monarch as John. Declaring himself the patron of every attempt towards discovery, he promoted it with all the ardour of his grand-uncle prince Henry, and with superior power. The effects of this were immediately felt.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1484.</NOTE> A powerful fleet was fitted out, which, after discovering the kingdoms of Benin and Congo, advanced above fifteen hundred miles beyond the line, and the Portuguese, for the first time, beheld a new heaven, and observed the stars of another hemisphere. John was not only solicitous to discover, but attentive to secure the possession of those countries. He built forts on the coast of Guinea; he sent out colonies to settle there; he established a commercial intercourse with the more powerful kingdoms; he endeavour∣ed to render such as were feeble or divided, tri∣butary to the crown of Portugal. Some of the petty princes voluntarily acknowledged themselves his vassals. Others were compelled to do so by force of arms. A regular and well-digested system was formed with respect to this new object of policy, and by firmly adhering to it the Portuguese power and commerce in Africa were established upon a solid foundation.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Hopes of discovering a new route to the East Indies.</NOTE>BY their constant intercourse with the people of Africa, the Portuguese gradually acquired some knowledge of those parts of that country which they had not visited. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ormation which they received from the natives, added to what they had observed in their own voyages, began to open prospects more extensive, and to suggest the idea
<PB N="89" REF="034476_0087_0FFDD50D2DDEC088"/>
of schemes more important, than those which had hitherto allured and occupied them. They had detected the error of the ancients concerning the nature of the torrid zone. They found, as they proceeded southwards, that the continent of Africa, instead of extending in breadth, according to the doctrine of Ptolemy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vida. Nob. Orbis Tubul. Geograph. secund. Ptolem. Amst. 1730.</NOTE>, at that time the oracle and guide of the learned in the science of geography, appeared sensibly to contract itself, and to bend towards the cast. This induced them to give credit to the accounts of the ancient Phenician voyages round Africa, which had long been deem∣ed fabulous, and led them to conceive hopes that by following the same route, they might arrive at the East Indies, and engross that commerce which has been the source of wealth and power to every nation possessed of it. The comprehensive genius of prince Henry, as we may conjecture from the words of the pope's bull, had early formed some idea of this navigation. But though his coun∣trymen, at that period, were incapable of con∣ceiving the extent of his views and schemes, all the Portuguese mathematicians and pilots now concurred in representing them as well-founded and practicable. The king entered with warmth into their sentiments, and began to concert mea∣sures for this arduous and important voyage.</P>
<P>BEFORE his preparations for this expedition were finished, accounts were transmitted from Africa,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schemes for accom∣plishing this.</NOTE>
that various nations along the coast had mentioned a mighty kingdom situated on their continent, at a great distance towards the east, the king of which, according to their description, professed the Chris∣tian religion. The Portuguese monarch imme∣diately concluded, that this must be the emperor of

Abyssinia, to whom the Europeans, seduced by a mistake of Rubruquis, Marco Polo, and other tra∣vellers to the east, absurdly gave the name of Pres∣ter or Presbyter John; and as he hoped to receive information and assistance from a Christian prince, in prosecuting a scheme that tended to propagate their common faith, he resolved to open, if pos∣sible, some intercourse with his court. With this view, he made choice of Pedro de Covillam and Alphonso de Payva, who were perfect masters of the Arabic language, and sent them into the east, to search for the residence of this unknown potentate, and to make him proffers of friendship. They had in charge likewise to procure whatever intelligence the nations which they visited could supply, with respect to the trade of India, and the course of navigation to that continent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Faria y Sousa Port.

He stretched boldly towards the south, and pro∣ceeding beyond the utmost limits to which his countrymen had hitherto advanced, discovered near a thousand miles of new country. Neither the danger to which he was exposed, by a succes∣sion of violent tempests in unknown seas, and by the frequent mutinies of his crew, nor the calami∣ties of famine which he suffered from losing his store-ship, could deter him from prosecuting his

enterprise. In recompence of his labours and perseverance, he at last descried that lofty pro∣montory which bounds Africa to the south. But to descry it, was all that he had in his power to accomplish. The violence of the winds, the shattered condition of his ships, and the turbulent spirit of his sailors, compelled him to return, after a voyage of sixteen months, in which he discover∣ed a far greater extent of country than any former navigator. Diaz had called the promontory which terminated his voyage <HI>Cabo Tormentoso,</HI> or the stormy Cape; but the king, his master, as he now entertained no doubt of having found the long desired route to India, gave it a name more in∣viting and of better omen, <HI>The Cape of Good Hope</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Faria y Sousa Port.

Covillam and Payva, in obedience to their master's instructions, had repaired to Grand Cairo. From that city, they travelled along with a caravan of Egyptian merchants, and embarking on the Red Sea, arrived at Aden in Arabia. There they separated; Payva sailed directly towards Abyssinia; Covillam embarked for the East Indies, and hav∣ing visited Calecut, Goa, and other cities on the Malabar coast, returned to Sofala, on the east side of Africa, and thence to Grand Cairo, which Payva and he had fixed upon as their place of rendez∣vous. Unfortunately the former wras cruelly mur∣dered in Abyssinia, but Covillam found at Cairo two Portuguese Jews, whom John, whose provi∣dent sagacity attended to every circumstance that could facilitate the excution of his schemes, had dispatched after them, in order to receive a detail
<PB N="92" REF="034476_0090_0FFDD514F53A4FF0"/>
of their proceedings, and to communicate to them new instructions. By one of these Jews, Covillam transmitted to Portugal a journal of his travels by sea and land, his remarks upon the trade of India, together with exact maps of the coasts on which he had touched; and from what he himself had ob∣served, as well as from the information of skilful seamen in different countries, he concluded, that by sailing round Africa, a passage might be found to the East Indies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Faria y Sousa Port.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparati∣ons for another voyage.</NOTE>THE happy coincidence of Covillam's opinion and report with the discoveries which Diaz had lately made, left hardly any shadow of doubt with respect to the possibility of sailing from Europe to India. But the vast length of the voyage, and the furious storms which Diaz had encountered near the Cape of Good Hope, alarmed and inti∣midated the Portuguese to such a degree, al∣though by long experience they were now become adventurous and skilful mariners, that some time was requisite to prepare their minds for this dan∣gerous and extraordinary voyage. The courage, however, and authority of the monarch, gradually dispelled the vain fears of his subjects, or made it necessary to conceal them. As John thought him∣self now upon the eve of accomplishing that great design, which had been the principal object of his reign, his earnestness in prosecuting it be∣came so vehement, that it occupied his thoughts by day, and bereaved him of sleep through the night.

As navigation, in every direction, was now became enterprising, he proceeded be∣yond that island, the Thule of the ancients, and ad∣vanced several degrees within the polar circle. Having satisfied his curiosity, by a voyage which tended more to enlarge his knowledge of naval affairs, than to improve his fortune, he entered into the service of a famous sea-captain, of his own name and family. This man commanded a small squadron, fitted out at his own expence, and by cruising sometimes against the Mahometans, some∣times against the Venetians, the rivals of his coun∣try in trade, had acquired both wealth and reputa∣tion.

At length, in an obstinate engagement, off the coast of Portugal, with some Venetian caravals, returning richly laden from the Low Countries, the vessel on board which he served took fire, together with one of the enemy's ships, to which it was fast grappled. In this dreadful extremity his intrepidity and presence of mind did not forsake him. He threw himself into the sea, laid hold of a floating oar, and by the support of it, and his dexterity in swimming, he reached the shore, though above two leagues distant, and saved a life reserved for great undertakings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. v.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="034476_0094_0FFDC529234ADDC8"/>AS soon as he recovered strength for the jour∣ney, he repaired to Lisbon, where many of his countrymen were settled.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He enters into the Portuguese service.</NOTE> They soon conceived such a favourable opinion of his merit, as well as talents, that they warmly solicited him to remain in that kingdom, where his naval skill and experience could not fail of rendering him conspicuous. To every adventurer, animated either with curiosity to visit new countries, or with ambition to distinguish himself, the Portuguese service was at that time extremely inviting. Columbus listened with a fa∣vourable ear to the advice of his friends, and hav∣ing gained the esteem of a Portuguese lady, whom he married, fixed his residence in Lisbon. This alliance, instead of detaching him from a sea-faring life, contributed to enlarge the sphere of his naval knowledge, and to excite a desire of extending it still farther. His wife was a daughter of Bartho∣lomew Perestrello, one of the captains employed by prince Henry in his early navigations, and who, under his protection, had discovered and planted the islands of Porto Santo and Maderia. Columbus got possession of the journals and charts of this expe∣rienced navigator, and from them he learned the course which the Portuguese had held in making their discoveries, as well as the various circum∣stances which guided or encouraged them in their attempts. The study of these soothed and in∣flamed his favourite passion; and while he con∣templated the maps, and read the descriptions of the new countries which Perestrello had seen, his impatience to visit them became irresistible. In order to indulge it, he made a voyage to Madeira, and continued during several years to trade with that island, with the Canaries, the Azores, the settlements in Guinea, and all the other places which the Portu∣guese had discovered on the continent of Africa.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. iv. v.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="97" REF="034476_0095_0FFDD52353069330"/>BY the experience which Columbus acquired, during such a variety of voyages, to almost every part of the globe with which, at that time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The effects of their dis∣coveries upon him.</NOTE> any in∣tercourse was carried on by sea, he was now be∣come one of the most skilful navigators in Europe. But, not satisfied with that praise, his ambition aimed at something more. The successful progress of the Portuguese navigators had awakened a spirit of curiosity and emulation, which set every man of science upon examining all the circumstances that led to the discoveries which they had made, or that afforded a prospect of succeeding in any new and bolder undertaking. The mind of Columbus, naturally inquisitive, capable of deep reflection, and turned to speculations of this kind, was so often employed in revolving the principles upon which the Portuguese had founded their schemes of discovery, and the mode on which they had carried them on, that he gradually began to form an idea of improving upon their plan, and of ac∣complishing discoveries which hitherto they had attempted in vain.</P>
<P>TO find out a passage by sea to the East Indies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He forms the idea of a new course to India.</NOTE> was the great object in view at that period. From the time that the Portuguese doubled Cape de Verd, this was the point at which they aimed in all their navigations, and, in comparison with it, all their discoveries in Africa appeared inconsider∣able. The fertility and riches of India had been known for many ages; its spices and other valuable commodities were in high request throughout Eu∣rope, and the vast wealth of the Venetians arising from their having engrossed this trade, had raised the envy of all nations. But how intent soever the Portuguese were upon discovering a new route to those desirable regions, they searched for it only by steering towards the south, in hopes of arriving at India, by turning to the east, after they had sailed
<PB N="98" REF="034476_0096_0FFDD524E5A86180"/>
round the farther extremity of Africa. This course was still unknown, and, even if discovered, was of such immense length, that a voyage from Europe to India must have appeared, at that period, an undertaking, extremely arduous, and of very uncer∣tain issue. More than half a century had been em∣ployed in advancing from Cape Non to the equa∣tor; a much longer space of time might elapse be∣fore the more extensive navigation from that to India could be accomplished. These reflections upon the uncertainty, the danger and tediousness of the course which the Portuguese were pursuing, naturally led Columbus to consider whether a shorter and more direct passage to the East Indies might not be found out. After revolving long and seriously every circumstance suggested by his supe∣rior knowledge in the theory as well as practice of navigation, after comparing attentively the ob∣servations of modern pilots with the hints and conjectures of ancient authors, he at last concluded, that by sailing directly towards the west, across the Atlantic ocean, new countries which probably formed a part of the great continent of India, must infallibly be discovered.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The princi∣ples on which his theory was founded.</NOTE>PRINCIPLES and arguments of various kinds, and derived from different sources, induced him to adopt this opinion, seemingly as chimerical as it was new and extraordinary. The spherical figure of the earth was known, and its magnitude ascer∣tained with some degree of accuracy. From this it was evident, that the comments of Europe, Asia, and Africa, as far as they were known at that time, formed but a small portion of the terraqueous globe. It was suitable to our ideas concerning the wisdom and beneficence of the Author of Nature, to believe that the vast space still unexplored, was not covered entirely by a waste unprofitable ocean, but occupied by countries fit for the habitation of
<PB N="99" REF="034476_0097_0FFDD52677935B20"/>
man. It appeared likewise extremely probable, that the continent, on this side of the globe, was balanced by a proportional quantity of land in the other hemisphere. These conclusions concerning the existence of another continent, drawn from the figure and structure of the globe, were confirmed by the observations and conjectures of modern na∣vigators. A Portuguese pilot, having stretched farther to the west than was usual at that time, took up a piece of timber artificially carved, float∣ing upon the sea; and as it was driven towards him by a westerly wind, he concluded that it came from some unknown land, situated in that quarter. Columbus's brother-in-law had found, to the west of the Madeira isles, a piece of timber fashioned in the same manner, and brought by the same wind; and had seen likewise canes of an enormous size floating upon the waves, which resembled those described by Ptolemy as productions peculiar to the East-Indies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lib. i. c. 17.</NOTE>. After a course of westerly winds, trees, torn up by the roots, were often driven upon the coasts of the Azores, and at one time the dead bodies of two men with singular features, resem∣bling neither the inhabitants of Europe nor of Africa, were cast ashore there.</P>
<P>AS the force of this united evidence, arising from theoretical principles and practical observa∣tions, led Columbus to expect the discovery of new countries in the western ocean, other reasons induced him to believe that these must be con∣nected with the continent of India. Though the ancients had hardly ever penetrated into India farther than the banks of the Ganges, yet some Greek authors had ventured to describe the pro∣vinces beyond that river. As men are prone, and at liberty, to magnify what is remote or unknown,
<PB N="100" REF="034476_0098_0FFDD5A962E4EC20"/>
they represented them as regions of an immense extent. Ctesias affirmed that India was as large as all the rest of Asia. Onesicritus, whom Pliny the naturalist follows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nat. Hist. Lib. vi. c. 17.</NOTE>, contended that it was equal to a third part of the habitable earth. Nearchus asserted, that it would take four months to march in a straight line from one extremity of India to the other<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Strab. Geogr. lib. xv. p. 1011.</NOTE>. The journal of Marco Polo, who had proceeded towards the east far beyond the limits to which any European had ever advanced, seemed to confirm these exaggerated accounts of the ancients. By his magnificent descriptions of the kingdoms of <HI>Cathay</HI> and <HI>Cipango,</HI> and of many other countries, the names of which were unknown in Europe, India appeared to be a region of vast extent. From these accounts, which, however de∣fective, were the most accurate that the people of Europe had received at that period, with respect to the remote parts of the East, Columbus drew a just conclusion. He contended, that, in propor∣tion as the continent of India stretched out towards the East, it must, in consequence of the spherical figure of the earth, approach nearer to the islands which had lately been discovered to the west of Africa; that the distance from the one to the other was probably not very considerable; and that the most direct, as well as shortest course to the remote regions of the east, was to be found by sail∣ing due west<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XII.</NOTE>. This notion concerning the vicinity of India to the western parts of our continent, was countenanced by some eminent writers among the ancients, the sanction of whose authority was ne∣cessary, in that age, to procure a favourable recep∣tion to any tenet. Aristotle thought it probable that the Columns of Hercules, or Straits of Gibral∣tar,
<PB N="101" REF="034476_0099_0FFDD5ABFA6F1B40"/>
were not far removed from the East Indies, and that there might be a communication by sea be∣tween them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Aristot. de Coelo, lib. ii. c. 14. edit. Du Val, Par. 1629. vol. i. p. 472.</NOTE>. Seneca, in terms still more explicit, affirms, that, with a fair wind, one might sail from Spain to India, in a few days<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Senec. Quaest. Natur. lib. i. in proem.</NOTE>. The famous At∣lantic island described by Plato, and supposed by many to be a real country, beyond which an un∣known continent was situated, is represented by him as lying at no great distance from Spain. After weighing all these particulars, Columbus, in whose character the modesty and diffidence of true genius was united with the ardent enthusiasm of a pro∣jector, did not rest with such absolute assurance either upon his own arguments, or upon the au∣thority of the ancients, as not to consult such of his contemporaries as were capable of comprehending the nature of the evidence which he produced in support of his opinion. As early as the year one thousand four hundred and seventy-four, he com∣municated his ideas concerning the probability of discovering new countries, by sailing westwards, to Paul, a physician of Florence, eminent for his knowledge of cosmography, and who, from the learning as well as candour which he discovers in his reply, appears to have been well entitled to the confidence which Columbus placed in him. He warmly approved of the plan, suggested several facts in confirmation of it, and encouraged Columbus to persevere in an undertaking so laudable, and which must redound so much to the honour of his country, and the benefit of Europe<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. viii.</NOTE>.</P>

would have served only as the foundation of some plausible and fruitless theory, which might have furnished matter for ingenious discourse, or fanciful conjecture. But with his sanguine and enterprising temper, speculation led directly to action. Fully satisfied himself with respect to the truth of his system, he was impatient to bring it to the test of experiment, and to set out upon a voyage of dis∣covery. The first step towards this was to secure the patronage of some of the considerable powers in Europe, capable of undertaking such an enter∣prise. As long absence had not extinguished the affection which he bore to his native country, he wished that it should reap the fruits of his labours and invention.<NOTE PLACE="marg">He applies to the Ge∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>;</NOTE> With this view, he laid his scheme before the Senate of Genoa, and making his country the first tender of his service, offered to fail under the banners of the republic, in quest of the new regions which he expected to discover. But Columbus had resided for so many years in foreign parts, that his countrymen were unac∣quainted with his abilities and character; and, though a maritime people, were so little accustom∣ed to distant voyages, that they could form no just idea of the principles on which he founded his hopes of success. They inconsiderately rejected his proposal, as the dream of a chimerical pro∣jector, and lost for ever the opportunity of re∣storing their commonwealth to its ancient splen∣dour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera Hist. de las Indias Occid. dec. i. lib. i. c. 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">to the king of Portugal.</NOTE>HAVING performed what was due to his coun∣try, Columbus was so little discouraged by the repulse which he had received, that, instead of relinquishing his undertaking, he pursued it with fresh ardour. He made his next overture to John II. king of Portugal, in whose dominions he
<PB N="103" REF="034476_0101_0FFDD5B197FEEDD8"/>
had been long established, and whom he considered, on that account, as having the second claim to his service. Here every circumstance seemed to pro∣mise him a more favourable reception. He ap∣plied to a monarch of an enterprising genius, no incompetent judge in naval affairs, and proud of patronising every attempt to discover new coun∣tries. His subjects were the most experienced navigators in Europe, and the least apt to be inti∣midated either by the novelty or boldness of any maritime expedition. In Portugal, the professional skill of Columbus, as well as his personal good qualities, were thoroughly known; and as the former rendered it probable that his scheme was not altogether visionary, the latter exempted him from the suspicion of any sinister intention in pro∣posing it. Accordingly, the king listened to him in the most gracious manner, and referred the consideration of his plan to Diego Ortiz, bishop of Ceuta, and two Jewish physicians, eminent cosmographers, whom he was accustomed to con∣sult in matters of this kind. As in Genoa, igno∣rance had opposed and disappointed Columbus; in Lisbon, he had to combat with prejudice, an enemy no less formidable.

full discovery of its nature, they deferred passing a final judgment with respect to it. In the mean time, they conspired to rob him of the honour and advantages which he expected from the success of his scheme, advising the king to dispatch a vessel secretly, in order to attempt the proposed disco∣very, by following exactly the course which Co∣lumbus seemed to point out. John, forgetting, on this occasion the sentiments becoming a mo∣narch, meanly adopted this perfidious counsel. But the pilot, chosen to execute Columbus's plan, had neither the genius, nor the fortitude of its author. Contrary winds arose, no sight of ap∣proaching land appeared, his courage failed, and he returned to Lisbon, execrating the project as equally extravagant and dangerous <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus▪ c. xi.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He leaves Portugal, and repairs to the court of <HI>Spain.</HI></NOTE>UPON discovering this dishonourable transaction, Columbus, felt the indignation natural to an inge∣nious mind, and in the warmth of his resentment determined to break off all intercourse with a nation capable of such flagrant treachery. He instantly quitted the kingdom, and landed in Spain towards the close of the year one thousand four hundred and eighty-four. As he was now at liberty to court the protection of any patron, whom he could engage to approve of his plan, and to carry it into execution, he resolved to propose it in person to Ferdinand and Isabella, who at that time governed the united kingdoms of Castile and Aragon.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sende his brother in∣to England</NOTE> But as he had already experienced the uncertain issue of applications to kings and mini∣sters, he took the precaution of sending into Eng∣land his brother Bartholomew, to whom he had fully communicated his ideas, in order that he might negociate, at the same time, with Henry

<P>IT was not without reason that Columbus enter∣tained doubts and fears with respect to the recep∣tion of his proposals in the Spanish court.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Obstacles to his suc∣cess in Spain.</NOTE> Spain was, at that juncture, engaged in a dangerous war with Grenada, the last of the Moorish kingdoms in that country. The wary and suspicious temper of Ferdinand was not formed to relish bold or uncommon designs. Isabella, though more gene∣rous and enterprising, was under the influence of her husband in all her actions. The Spaniards had hitherto made no efforts to extend navigation beyond its ancient limits, and had beheld the amazing progress of discovery among their neigh∣bours the Portuguese, without one attempt to imitate or to rival them. The war with the Infi∣dels afforded an ample field to the national activity and love of glory. Under circumstances so unfa∣vourable, it was impossible for Columbus to make rapid progress with a nation, naturally slow and dilatory in forming all its resolutions. His cha∣racter, however, was admirably adapted to that of the people, whose confidence and protection he solicited. He was grave, though courteous in his deportment; circumspect in his words and actions; irreproachable in his morals; and exemplary in his attention to all the duties and functions of religion. By qualities so respectable, he not only gained many private friends, but acquired such general esteem, that, notwithstanding the plainness of his appearance, suitable to the mediocrity of his for∣tune, he was not considered as a mere adventurer, to whom indigence had suggested a visionary pro∣ject, but was received as a person to whose propo∣sitions serious attention was due.</P>

much regard to Columbus, as to remit the consi∣deration of his plan to the queen's confessor, Ferdinand de Talavera. He consulted such of his countrymen as were supposed best qualified to decide with respect to a subject of this kind. But true science had, hitherto, made so little progress in Spain, that the pretended philosophers, selected to judge in a matter of such moment, did not comprehend the first principles upon which Co∣lumbus founded his conjectures and hopes. Some of them, from mistaken notions concerning the dimensions of the globe, contended that a voyage to those remote parts of the east, which Columbus expected to discover, could not be performed in less than three years. Others concluded, that either he would find the ocean to be of infinite extent, according to the opinion of some ancient philosophers; or, if he should persist in steering towards the west beyond a certain point, that the convex figure of the globe would prevent his re∣turn, and that he must inevitably perish, in the vain attempt to open a communication between the two opposite hemispheres, which nature had for ever disjoined. Even without deigning to enter into any particular discussion, many rejected the scheme in general, upon the credit of a maxim, under which the ignorant and unenterprising shelter themselves in every age, "That it is presumptu∣ous in any person, to suppose that he alone possesses knowledge superior to all the rest of mankind united." They maintained, that if there were really any such countries as Columbus pretended, they could not have remained so long concealed, nor would the wisdom and sagacity of former ages have left the glory of this invention to an obscure Genoese pilot.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">who made unfavoura∣ble reports concerning it.</NOTE>IT required all Columbus's patience and address to negociate with men capable of advancing such
<PB N="107" REF="034476_0105_0FFDD5BC81EB4988"/>
strange propositions. He had to contend not only with the obstinacy of ignorance, but with what is still more attractable, the pride of false knowledge. After innumerable conferences, and wasting five years in fruitless endeavours to inform and to satisfy judges so little capable of deciding with propriety, Talavera, at last, made such an unfavourable re∣port to Ferdinand and Isabella, as induced them to acquaint Columbus, that until the war with the Moors should be brought to a period, it would be imprudent to engage in any new and extensive enterprise.</P>
<P>WHATEVER care was taken to soften the harsh∣nesh of this declaration, Columbus considered it as a final rejection of his proposals. But happily for mankind, that superiority of genius, which is ca∣pable of forming great and uncommon designs, is usually accompanied with an ardent enthusiasm, which can neither be cooled by delays, nor damped by disappointment. Columbus was of this san∣guine temper. Though he felt deeply the cruel blow given to his hopes, and retired immediately from a court, where he had been amused so long with vain expectations, his confidence in the just∣ness of his own system did not diminish, and his impatience to demonstrate the truth of it by an actual experiment, became greater than ever. Hav∣ing courted the protection of sovereign states with∣out success, he applied, next, to persons of inferi∣or rank, and addressed successively the dukes of Medina, Sidonia, and Medina Celi, who, though subjects, were possessed of power and opulence more than equal to to the enterprise which he projected. His negociations with them proved as fruitless, as those in which he had been hitherto engaged; for these noblemen were either as little convinced by Columbus's arguments as their supe∣riors, or they were afraid of alarming the jealousy,
<PB N="108" REF="034476_0106_0FFDD5BF15BB33B0"/>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Negociati∣on of his brother in England.</NOTE>AMID the painful sensations occasioned by such a succession of disappointments, Columbus had to sustain the additional distress, of having received no accounts of his brother, whom he had sent to the court of England. In his voyage to that coun∣try, Bartholomew had been so unfortunate as to fall into the hands of pirates, who having stripped him of every thing, detained him a prisoner for se∣veral years. At length he made his escape, and arrived in London, but in such extreme indigence, that he was obliged to employ himself, during a considerable time, in drawing and selling maps, in order to pick up as much money as would pur∣chase a decent dress, in which he might venture to appear at court. He then laid before the king the proposals, with which he had been entrusted by his brother, and, notwithstanding Henry's excessive caution and parsimony, which rendered him averse to new or expensive undertakings, he received Co∣lumbus's overtures, with more approbation, than any monarch to whom they had hitherto been pre∣sented.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Columbus has some prospects of encou∣ragement in Spain.</NOTE>MEANWHILE, Columbus being unacquainted with his brother's fate, and having now no prospect of encouragement in Spain, resolved to visit the court of England in person, in hopes of meeting with a more favourable reception there. He had already made preparations for this purpose, and taken measures for the disposal of his children during his absence, when Juan Perez, the guardian of the monastery of Rabida, near Palos, in which they had been educated, earnestly solicited him to defer his journey for a short time.

with Queen Isabella, to whom he was known per∣sonally. He was warmly attached to Columbus, with whose abilities as well as integrity he had many opportunities of being acquainted. Prompt∣ed by curiosity or by friendship, he entered upon an accurate examination of his system, in conjunc∣tion with a physician settled in the neighbou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>▪ who was a considerable proficient in mathematical knowledge.

<P>MOVED by the representations of a person whom she respected, Isabella desired Perez to repair im∣mediately to the village of Santa Fe, in which, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> account of the siege of Granada, the court reside<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at that time, that she might confer with him upon this important subject. The first effect of their in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>terview was a gracious invitation of Columbus back to court, accompanied with the present of a small sum to equip him for the journey. As there was now a certain prospect, that the war with the Moors would speedily be brought to an happy issue by the reduction of Granada, which would leave the nation at liberty to engage in new undertakings; this, as well as the mark of royal savour, with which Columbus had been lately honoured, en∣couraged his friends to appear with greater con∣fidence than formerly in support of his scheme. The chief of these, Alonso de Quintanilla, comp∣troller of the finances in Castile, and Luis de San∣tangel, receiver of the ecclesiastical revenues in

Aragon, whose meritorious zeal in promoting this great design, entitles their names to an honourable place in history, introduced Columbus to many persons of high rank, and interested them warmly in his behalf.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Is again disappoin∣ted.</NOTE>BUT it was not an easy matter to inspire Fer∣dinand with favourable sentiments. He still re∣garded Columbus's prospect as extravagant and chimerical; and in order to render the efforts of his partizans ineffectual, he had the address to em∣ploy in this new negociation with him, some of the persons who had formerly pronounced his scheme to be impracticable. To their astonishment, Colum∣bus appeared before them with the same confident hopes of success as formerly, and insisted upon the same high recompence. He proposed that a small fleet should be fitted out, under his command, to attempt the discovery, and demanded to be ap∣pointed hereditary admiral and viceroy of all the seas and lands which he should discover, and to have the tenths of the profits arising from them, settled irrevocably upon himself and his de∣scendants. At the same time, he offered o ad∣vance the eighth part of the sum necessary for ac∣complishing his design, on condition that he should be entitled to a proportional share of benefit from the adventure. If the enterprise should totally miscarry, he made no stipulation for any reward or emolument whatever. Instead of viewing this con∣duct as the clearest evidence of his full persuasion with respect to the truth of his own system, or be∣ing struck with that magnanimity which, after so many delays and repulses, would stoop to nothing inferior to its original claims, the persons with whom Columbus treated, began meanly to calculate the expence of the expedition, and the value of the reward which he demanded. The expence, mode∣rate as it was, they represented to be too great for

Spain, in the present exhausted state of its finances. They contended, that the honours and emolu∣ments claimed by Columbus, were exorbitant, even if he should perform the utmost of what he had promised; and if all his sanguine hopes should prove illusive, such vast concessions to an adventurer would be deemed not only inconsiderate, but ridi∣culous. In this imposing garb of caution and pru∣dence, their opinion appeared so plausible, and was so warmly supported by Ferdinand, that Isabella declined giving any countenance to Columbus, and abruptly broke off the negociation with him which she had begun.</P>
<P>THIS was more mortifying to Columbus than all the disappointments which he had hitherto met with. The invitation to court from Isabella, like an unexpected ray of light, had opened such pro∣spects of success, as encouraged him to hope that his labours were at an end; but now darkness and uncertainty returned, and his mind, firm as it was, could hardly support the shock of such an unfore∣seen reverse. He withdrew in deep anguish from court, with an intention of prosecuting his voyage to England, as his last resource.</P>

<PB N="112" REF="034476_0110_0FFDD5C9CF941150"/>
always been the munificent patroness of generous undertakings, should hesitate so long to counte∣nance the most splendid scheme that had ever been proposed to any monarch; they represented to her, that Columbus was a man of a sound understanding and virtuous character, well qualified, by his ex∣perience in navigation, as well as his knowledge of geometry, to form just ideas with respect to the structure of the globe and the situation of its va∣rious regions; that, by offering to risk his own life and fortune in the execution of his scheme, he gave the most satisfying evidence both of his integrity and hope of success; that the sum requisite for equipping such an armament as he demanded was inconsiderable, and the advantages which might accrue from his undertaking were immense; that he demanded no recompence for his invention and labour, but what was to arise from the countries which he should discover; that, as it was worthy of her magnanimity to make this noble attempt to extend the sphere of human knowledge, and to open an intercourse with regions hitherto unknown, so it would afford the highest satisfaction to her piety and zeal, after re-establishing the Christian faith in those provinces of Spain from which it had been long banished,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1492.</NOTE> to discover a new world, to which she might communicate the light and bles∣sings of divine truth; that if now she did not decide instantly, the opportunity would be irre∣trievably lost; that Columbus was on his way to foreign countries, where some prince, more for∣tunate or adventurous, would close with his pro∣posals, and Spain would for ever bewail the fatal timidity which had excluded her from the glory and advantages that she had once in her power to have enjoyed.</P>

produced the desired effect. They dispelled all Isabella's doubts and fears; she ordered▪ Columbus to be instantly recalled, declared her resolution of employing him on his own terms, and regretting the low state of her finances, generously offered to pledge her own jewels, in order to raise as much money as might be needed in making preparations for the voyage. Santangel, in a transport of gra∣titude, kissed the queen's hand, and in order to save her from having recourse to such a mortifying expedient for procuring money, engaged to advance immediately the sum that was requisite <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera. dec. 1. lib. i. c. 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>COLUMBUS had proceeded some leagues on his journey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The condi∣tions of h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> agreement with S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e▪</NOTE> when the messenger from Isabella over∣took him. Upon receiving an account of the un∣expected revolution in his favour, he returned di∣rectly to Santo Fe, though some remainder of diffidence still mingled itself with his joy. But the cordial reception which he met with from Isabella, together with the near prospect of setting out upon that voyage which had so long been the object of his thoughts and wishes, soon effaced the remem∣brance of all that he had suffered in Spain, during eight tedious years of solicitation and suspence. The negociation now went forward with facility and dispatch, and a treaty or capitulation with Columbus was signed on the seventeenth of April, one thousand four hundred and ninety-two. The chief articles of it were, 1. Ferdinand and Isabella as sovereigns of the ocean, constituted Columbus their high admiral in all the seas, islands, and con∣tinents which should be discovered by his industry; and stipulation that he and his heirs for ever should enjoy this office, with the same powers and prero∣gatives which belonged to the high admiral of Castile, within the limits of his jurisdiction. 2. They
<PB N="114" REF="034476_0112_0FFDD5CE2590A748"/>
appointed Columbus their viceroy in all the islands and continents which he should discover; but if, for the better administration of affairs, it should hereafter be necessary to establish a separate go∣vernor in any of those countries, they authorised Columbus to name three persons, of whom they would choose one for that office; and the dignity of viceroy, with all its immunities, was likewise to be hereditary in the family of Columbus. 3. They granted to Columbus and his heirs for ever, the tenth of the free profits accruing from the pro∣ductions and commerce of the countries which he should discover. 4. They declared, that if any controversy or law-suit shall arise with respect to any mercantile transaction in the countries which should be discovered, it should be determined by the sole authority of Columbus, or of judges to be appointed by him. 5. They permitted Columbus to advance one eighth part of what should be expended in preparing for the expedition, and in carrying on commerce with the countries which he should dis∣cover, and intitled him, in return, to an eighth part of the profit <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 15. Herrera, dec. 1. lib. i. c. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOUGH the name of Ferdinand appears con∣joined with that of Isabella in this transaction, his distrust of Columbus was still so violent that he refused to take any part in the enterprise as king of Aragon. As the whole expence of the expe∣dition was to be defrayed by the crown of Castile, Isabella reserved for her subjects of that kingdom an exclusive right to all the benefits which might redound from its success.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The prepa∣rations for his voyage.</NOTE>AS soon as the treaty was signed, Isabella, by her attention and activity in forwarding the prepa∣rations for the voyage, endeavoured to make some
<PB N="115" REF="034476_0113_0FFDD5D2C73E0CB8"/>
reparation to Columbus for the time which he had lost in fruitless solicitation. By the twelfth of May, all that depended upon her was adjusted; and Co∣lumbus waited on the king and queen, in order to receive their final instructions. Every thing re∣specting the destination and conduct of the voyage, they committed implicitly to the disposal of his pru∣dence. But that they might avoid giving any just cause of offence to the king of Portugal, they strictly enjoined him not to approach near to the Portuguese settlements on the coast of Guinea, or in any of the other countries to which the Portu∣guese claimed right as discoverers. Isabella had ordered the ships, of which Columbus was to take the command, to be fitted out in the port of Palos, a small maritime town in the Province of Anda∣lusia. As the guardian Juan Perez, to whom Co∣lumbus had already been so much indebted, resided in the neighbourhood of this place, he, is by the influence of that good ecclesiastic, as well by his own connection with the inhabitants, not only raised among them what he wanted of the sum that he was bound by treaty to advance, but engaged se∣veral of them to accompany him in the voyage. The chief of these associates were three brothers of the name of Pinzon, of considerable wealth, and of great experience in naval affairs, who were willing to hazard their lives and fortunes in the expedition.</P>
<P>BUT, after all the efforts of Isabella and Co∣lumbus, the armament was not suitable, either to the dignity of the nation by which it was equipped, or to the importance of the service for which it was destined. It consisted of three vessels. The largest, a ship of no considerable burden, was commanded by Columbus, as admiral, who gave it the name of <HI>Santa Maria,</HI> out of respect for the blessed Vir∣gin, whom he honoured with singular devotion.
<PB N="116" REF="034476_0114_0FFDD5D4586AEA60"/>
Of the second, called the <HI>Pinta,</HI> Martin Pinzon was captain, and his brother Francis, pilot. The third, named the <HI>Nigna,</HI> was under the command of Vincent Yanez Pinzon. These two were light vessels, hardly superior in burden or force to large boats. This squadron, if it merits that name, was victualled for twelve months, and had on board ninety men, mostly sailors, together with a few adventurers who followed the fortune of Columbus, and some gentlemen of Isabella's court, whom she appointed to accompany him. Though the ex∣pence of the undertaking was one of the circum∣stances which chiefly alarmed the court of Spain, and retarded so long the negociation with Co∣lumbus, the sum employed in sitting out this squad∣ron did not exceed four thousand pounds.</P>
<P>AS the art of ship-building in the fifteenth cen∣tury was extremely rude, and the bulk of vessels was accommodated to the short and easy voyages along the coast which they were accustomed to perform, it is a proof of the courage as well as en∣terprising genius of Columbus, that he ventured, with a fleet so unfit for a distant navigation, to ex∣plore unknown seas, where he had no chart to guide him, no knowledge of the tides and currents, and no experience of the dangers to which he might be exposed. His eagerness to accomplish the great design which had so long engrossed his thoughts, made him overlook or disregard every circumstance that would have intimidated a mind less adventurous. He pushed forward the prepa∣rations with such ardour, and was seconded so ef∣fectually by the persons to whom Isabella committed the superintendance of this business, that every thing was soon in readiness for the voyage. But as Columbus was deeply impressed with sentiments <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> religion, he would not set out upon an expedi∣tion so arduous, and of which one great object was
<PB N="117" REF="034476_0115_0FFDD5D5EB5EC498"/>
to extend the knowledge of the Christian faith, without imploring publicly the guidance and pro∣tection of Heaven. With this view <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, together with all the persons under his command, marched in solemn procession to the monastery of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>abida. After confessing their sins, and obtaining absolution, they received the holy sacrament from the hands of the guardian, who joined his prayers to theirs for the success, of an enterprise which he had so zealously patronized.</P>
<P>NEXT morning being Friday the third day of August,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>∣ture from Spain</NOTE> in the year one thousand four hundred and ninety-two, Columbus set sail, a little before sun∣rise, in presence of a vast crowd of spectators,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August 13.</NOTE> who sent up their supplications to Heaven for the pro∣sperous issue of the voyage, which they wished ra∣ther than expected. Columbus steered directly for the Canary Islands, and arrived there without any occurrence that would have deserved notice on any other occasion. But, in a voyage of such expecta∣tion and importance, every circumstance was the object of attention. The rudder of the Pinta broke loose, the day after she left the harbour, and that accident alarmed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ew, no less superstitious than unskilful, as a certain omen of the unfortunate destiny of the expedition. Even in the short r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to the Canaries, the ships were found so crazy and ill appointed, as to be very improper for a na∣vigation which was expected to be both long and dangerous. Columbus resitted them, however, to the best of his power, and having supplied himself with fresh provisions, he took his departure from Gomera, one of the most westerly of the Canary islands, on the sixth day of September.</P>
<P>HERE the voyage of discovery may properly be said to begin;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The course which i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> for Columbus holding his course due west, left immediately the usual track of navi∣gation, and stretched into unfrequented and un∣known
<PB N="118" REF="034476_0116_0FFDD5D999D88420"/>
seas. The first day, as it was very calm, he made but little way; but on the second, he lost sight of the Canaries; and many of the sailors, de∣jected already and dismayed, when they contem∣plated the boldness of the undertaking, began to beat their breasts, and to shed tears, as if they were never more to behold land. Columbus comforted them with assurances of success, and the prospect of vast wealth, in those opulent regions whither he was conducting them. This early discovery of the spirit of his follower, taught Columbus, that he must prepare to shuggle, not only with the un∣avoidable difficulties which might be expected from the nature of his undertaking, but with such as were likely to arise from the ignorance and ti∣midity of the people under his command; and he perceived that the art of governing the minds of men, would be no less reqiusite for accomplishing the discoveries which he had in view, than naval skill and undaunted courage. Happily for himself, and for the country by which he was employed, he joined to the ardent temper and inventive genius of a projector, virtues of another species, which are rarely united with them. He possessed a thorough knowledge of mankind, an insinuating address, a patient perseverance in executing any plan, the perfect government of his own passions, and the talent of acquiring an ascendant over those of other men. All these qualities, which formed him for command, were accompanied with that superior knowledge of his profession, which begets confi∣dence in times of difficulty and danger.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vigilance and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Columbus</NOTE> To un∣skilful Spanish sailors, accustomed only to coasting voyages in the Mediterranean, the maritime science of Columbus, the fruit of thirty years experience, improved by an acquaintance with all the inventions of the Portuguese, appeared immense. As soon as they put to sea, he regulated every thing by his
<PB N="119" REF="034476_0117_0FFDD5DB2AD4C478"/>
sole authority; he superintended the execution of every order; and allowing himself only a few hours for sleep, he was at all other times upon deck. As his course lay through seas which had not formerly been visited, the founding-line, or instruments for observation, were continually in his hands. After the example of the Portuguese discoverers, he attended to the motion of tides and currents, watching the flight of birds, the ap∣pearance of fishes, of sea-weeds, and of every thing that floated on the waves, and entered every occurrence, with a minute exactness, in the jour∣nal which he kept. As the length of the voyage could not fail of alarming sailors habituated only to short excursions, Columbus endeavoured to conceal from them the real progress which they made. With this view, though they run eighteen leagues on the second day after they left Gomera, he gave out that they had advanced only fifteen, and he uniformly employed the same artifice of reckoning short during the whole voyage. By the fourteenth of September, the fleet was above two hundred leagues to the west of the Canary Isles, at a greater distance from land than any Spaniard had been before that time.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> There they were struck with an appearance no less astonishing than new. They observed that the magnetic needle, in their compasses, did not point exactly to the polar star, but varied towards the west; and as they proceeded, this variation increased. This appearance, which is now familiar, though it still remains one of the mysteries of nature, into the cause of which the sagacity of man hath not been able to penetrate, filled the companions of Columbus with terror. They were now in a boundless and unknown ocean, far from the usual course of navigation; nature itself seemed to be altered, and the only guide which they had le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t was about to fail them. Co∣lumbus,
<PB N="120" REF="034476_0118_0FFDD5DDC4D0E900"/>
with no less quickness than ingenuity, in∣vented a reason for this appearance, which, though it did not satisfy himself, seemed so plausible to them, that it dispelled their fears, or silenced their murmurs.</P>
<P>HE still continued to steer due west, nearly in the same latitude with the Canary islands. In this course he came within the sphere of the trade wind, which blows ivariably from east to west, between the tropics and a few degrees beyond them. He advanced before this steady gale with such uniform rapidity, that it was seldom necessary to shift a sail. When about four hundred leagues to the west of the Canaries, he found the sea so covered with weeds, that it resembled a meadow of vast extent, and in some places they were so thick, as to retard the motion of the vessels. This strange appearance occasioned new alarm and disquiet. The sailors imagined that they were now arrived at the utmost boundary of the navigable ocean; that these float∣ing weeds would obstruct their farther progress, and conceal dangerous rocks, or some large tract of land, which had sunk, they knew not how, in that place. Columbus endeavoured to persuade them, that what had alarmed, ought rather to have encouraged them, and was to be considered as a sign of approaching land. At the same time, a brisk gale arose, and carried them forward. Seve∣ral birds were seen hovering about the ship <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XIII.</NOTE>, and directed their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight towards the west. The des∣ponding crew resumed some degree of spirit, and began to entertain fresh hopes.</P>

length of the navigation, he gave out that they had proceeded only five hundred and eighty-four leagues; and, fortunately for Columbus nei∣ther his own pilot, nor those of the other ships, had skill sufficient to correct this error, and discover the deceit. They had now been above three weeks at sea; they had proceeded far beyond what former navigators had attempted or deemed possi∣ble; all their prognostics of discovery, drawn from the flight of birds and other circumstances, had proved fallacious; the appearances of land, with which their own credulity or the artifice of their commander had from time to time flattered and amused them, had been altogether illusive, and their prospect of success seemed now to be as dis∣tant as ever. These reflections occurred often to men, who had no other object or occupation than to reason and discourse concerning the intention and circumstances of their expedition. They made impression, at first, upon the ignorant and timid, and extending, by degrees, to such as were better informed or more resolute, the contagion spread at length from ship to ship. From secret whispers or murmurings, they proceeded to open cabals and public complaints. They taxed their sovereign with inconsiderate credulity, in paying such regard to the vain promises and rash conjectures of an in∣digent foreigner, as to hazard the lives of so many of her own subjects, in prosecuting a chimerical scheme. They affirmed that they had fully per∣formed their duty, by venturing so far in an un∣known and hopeless course, and could incur no blame, for refusing to follow, any longer, a des∣perate adventurer to certain destruction. They contended, that it was necessary to think of return∣ing to Spain, while their crazy vessels were still in a condition to keep the sea, but expressed their fears that the attempt would prove vain, as the
<PB N="122" REF="034476_0120_0FFDD5E41CFDA950"/>
wind, which had hitherto been so favourable to their course, must render it impossible to sail in the opposite direction. All agreed that Columbus should be compelled by force to adopt a measure on which their common safety depended. Some of the more audacious proposed, as the most ex∣peditious and certain method for getting rid at once of his remonstrances, to throw him into the sea, being persuaded that, upon their return to Spain, the death of an unsuccessful projector would excite little concern, and be enquired into with no curiosity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The ad∣dress of Columbus in soothing them.</NOTE>COLUMBUS was fully sensible of his perilous situa∣tion. He had observed, with great uneasiness, the fatal operation of ignorance and of fear in produc∣ing disaffection among his crew, and saw that it was now ready to burst out into open mutiny. He retained, however, perfect presence of mind. He affected to seem ignorant of their machinations. Notwithstanding the agitation and solicitude of his own mind, he appeared with a chearful coun∣tenance, like a man satisfied with the progress he had made, and confident of success. Sometimes he employed all the arts of insinuation, to soothe his men. Sometimes he endeavoured to work upon their ambition or avarice, by magnificent descriptions of the fame and wealth which they were about to acquire. On other occasions, he assumed a tone of authority, and threatened them with vengeance from their sovereign, if by their dastardly behaviour, they should defeat this noble effort to promote the glory of God, and to exalt the Spanish name above that of every other nation. Even with seditious sailors, the words of a man whom they had been accustomed to reverence, were weighty and persuasive, and not only restrained them from those violent excesses, which they medi∣tated, but prevailed with them to accompany their admiral for some time longer.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="034476_0121_0FFDD5E5AD8411B0"/>AS they proceeded, the indications of approach∣ing land seemed to be more certain, and excited hope in proportion. The birds began to appear in flocks, making towards the south-west. Co∣lumbus, in imitation of the Portuguese navigators, who had been guided, in several of their discove∣ries, by the motion of birds, altered his course from due west towards that quarter whither they pointed their flight. But, after holding on for several days in this new direction, without any better success than formerly, having seen no object, during thirty days, but the sea and the sky, the hopes of his companions subsided faster than they had risen; their fears revived with additional force;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e return.</NOTE> impatience, rage, and despair, appeared in every countenance. All sense of subordination was lost:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Danger of a mutiny.</NOTE> the officers, who had hitherto concurred with Co∣lumbus in opinion, and supported his authority, now took part with the private men; they assem∣bled tumultuously on the deck, expostulated with their commander, mingled threats with their ex∣postulations, and required him instantly to tack about and to return to Europe. Columbus per∣ceived that it would be of no avail to have recourse to any of his former arts, which having been tried so often, had lost their effect; and that it was im∣possible to rekindle any zeal for the success of the expedition among men, in whose breasts fear had extinguished every generous sentiment.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distress of Columbus.</NOTE> He saw that it was no less vain to think of employing either gentle or severe measures, to quell a mutiny so general and so violent. It was necessary, on all these accounts, to soothe passions which he could no longer command, and to give way to a torrent too impetuous to be checked. He promised so∣lemnly to his men that he would comply with their request, provided they would accompany him, and obey his commands for three days longer, and if

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Encourag∣ing appear∣ances of success.</NOTE>ENRAGED as the sailors were, and impatient to turn their faces again towards their native country, this proposition did not appear to them unreason∣able. Nor did Columbus hazard much in confining himself to a term so short. The presages of discovering land were now so numerous and pro∣mising, that he deemed them infallible. For some days the sounding line reached the bottom, and the soil which it brought up indicated land to be at no great distance. The flocks of birds increased, and were composed not only of sea fowl, but of such land birds as could not be supposed to fly far from the shore. The crew of the Pinta observed a cane floating, which seemed to have been newly cut, and likewise a piece of timber artificially carved. The sailors aboard the Nigna took up the branch of a tree with red berries, perfectly fresh. The clouds around the setting sun assumed a new ap∣pearance; the air was more mild and warm, and, during night, the wind became unequal and varia∣ble. From all these symptoms, Columbus was so confident of being near land, that on the even∣ing of the eleventh of October, after public prayers for success, he ordered the sails to be furled, and the ships to lie to, keeping strict watch, lest they should be driven ashore in the night. During this interval of suspense and ex∣pectation, no man shut his eyes, all kept upon deck, gazing intently towards that quarter where they expected to discover the land, which had been so long the object of their wishes.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Land dis∣covered</NOTE>ABOUT two hours before midnight, Columbus standing on the forecastle, observed a light at a

distance, and privately pointed it out to Pedro Guttierez, a page of the queen's wardrobe. Gut∣tierez perceived it, and calling to Salcedo, comp∣troller of the fleet, all three saw it in motion, as if it were carried from place to place. A little after midnight the joyful sound of <HI>land, land,</HI> was heard from the Pinta, which kept always ahead of the other ships. But, having been so often de∣ceived by fallacious appearances, every man was now become slow of belief, and waited, in all the anguish of uncertainty and impatience, for the return of day. As soon as morning dawned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Friday. Oct. 12.</NOTE> all doubts and fears were dispelled. From every ship an island was seen about two leagues to the north, whose flat and verdant fields, well stored with wood, and watered with many rivulets, presented the aspect of a delightful country. The crew of the Pinta instantly began the <HI>Te Deum,</HI> as a hymn of thanksgiving to God, and were joined by those of the other ships, with tears of joy and transports of congratulation. This office of gratitude to Heaven was followed by an act of justice to their commander. They threw themselves at the feet of Columbus, with feelings of self-condemna∣tion mingled with reverence. They implored him to pardon their ignorance, incredulity, and inso∣lence, which had created him so much unnecessary di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>quiet, and had so often obstructed the prosecution of his well-concerted plan; and passing, in the warmth of their admiration, from one extreme to another, they now pronounced the man, whom they had so lately reviled and threatened, to be a person inspired by Heaven with sagacity and for∣titude more than human, in order to accomplish a design so far beyond the ideas and conception of all former ages.</P>
<P>AS soon as the sun arose,<NOTE PLACE="marg">First inter∣view with the na∣tiv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</NOTE> all their boats were manned and armed. They rowed towards the

island with their colours displayed, with warlike music, and other martial pomp. As they ap∣proached the coast, they saw it covered with a multitude of people, whom the novelty of the spectacle had drawn together, whose attitudes and gestures expressed wonder and astonishment at the strange objects which presented themselves to their view. Columbus was the first European who set foot in the New World which he had discovered. He landed in a rich dress, and with a naked sword in his hand. His men followed, and kneeling down, they all kissed the ground which they had so long desired to see. They next erected a cru∣cifix, and prostrating themselves before it, returned thanks to God for conducting their voyage to such an happy issue. They then took solemn posses∣sion of the country for the crown of Castile and Leon, with all the formalities which the Portuguese were accustomed to observe in acts of this kind, in their new discoveries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 22, 23.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their mu∣tual asto∣nishment.</NOTE>THE Spaniards, while thus employed, were surrounded by many of the natives, who gazed, in silent admiration, upon actions which they could not comprehend, and of which they did not fore∣see the consequences. The dress of the Spaniards, the whiteness of their skins, their beards, their arms, appeared strange and surprising. The vast machines in which they had traversed the ocean, that seemed to move upon the waters with wings, and uttered a dreadful sound resembling thunder, accompanied with lightning and smoke, struck them with such terror, that they began to respect their new guests as a superior order of beings, and concluded that they were children of the sun, who had descended to visit the earth.</P>
<P>THE Europeans were hardly less amazed at the
<PB N="127" REF="034476_0125_0FFDD5F0703297B0"/>
scene now before them. Every herb, and shrub, and tree, was different from those which flourished in Europe. The soil seemed to be rich, but bore few marks of cultivation. The climate, even to the Spaniards, felt warm, though extremely de∣lightful. The inhabitants appeared in the simple innocence of nature, entirely naked. Their black hair, long and uncurled, floated upon their shoul∣ders, or was bound in tresses around their heads. They had no beards, and every part of their bodies was perfectly smooth. Their complexion was of a dusky copper colour, their features singular, ra∣ther than disagreeable, their aspect gentle and timid. Though not tall, they were well shaped, and active. Their faces, and several parts of their body, were fantastically painted with glaring co∣lours. They were shy at first through fear, but soon became familiar with the Spaniards, and with transports of joy received from them hawks-bells, glass beads, or other baubles, in return for which they gave such provisions as they had, and some cotton yarn, the only commodity of value that they could produce. Towards evening, Columbus returned to his ship, accompanied by many of the islanders in their boats, which they called <HI>canoes,</HI> and though rudely formed out of the trunk of a single tree, they rowed them with surprising dex∣terity. Thus, in the first interview between the inhabitants of the old and new worlds, every thing was conducted amicably, and to their mutual satis∣faction. The former, enlightened and ambitious, formed already vast ideas with respect to the ad∣vantages which they might derive from the regions that began to open to their view.

Having observed that most of the people whom he had seen wore small plates of gold, by way of ornament, in their nos∣trils, he eagerly inquired where they got that preci∣ous metal. They pointed towards the south, and made him comprehend by signs, that gold abound∣ed in countries situated in that quarter. Thither he immediately determined to direct his course, in full confidence of finding there those opulent regions which had been the object of his voyage, and would be a recompence for all his toils and dangers. He took along with him seven of the natives of San Salvador, that, by acquiring the Spanish language, they might serve as guides and interpreters; and those innocent people considered it as a mark of distinction when they were selected to accompany him.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="034476_0127_0FFDD5F6CA2561B0"/>HE saw several islands, and touched at three of the largest, on which he bestowed the names of St. Mary of the Conception, Fernandina, and Isabella. But as their soil, productions, and inhabitants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovers Cuba.</NOTE> nearly resembled those of San Salvador, he made no stay in any of them. He inquired every where for gold, and the signs that were uniformly made by way of answer, confirmed him in the opinion that it was brought from the south. He followed that course, and soon discovered a country which appeared very extensive, not perfectly level, like those which he had already visited, but so diversi∣fied with rising grounds, hills, rivers, woods, and plains, that he was uncertain whether it might prove an island, or part of the continent. The natives of San Salvador, whom he had on board, called it <HI>Cuba;</HI> Columbus gave it the name of Juanna. He entered the mouth of a large river with his squadron, and all the inhabitants fled to the mountains as he approached the shore. But as he resolved to careen his ships in that place, he sent some Spaniards, together with one of the people of San Salvador, to view the interior part of the country. They, having advanced above sixty miles from the shore, reported, upon their return, that the soil was richer and more cultivated than any they had hitherto discovered; that, be∣sides many scattered cottages, they had found one village, containing above a thousand inhabitants; that the people, though naked, seemed to be more intelligent than those of San Salvador, but had treated them with the same respectful attention, kissing their feet, and honouring them as sacred beings allied to Heaven; that they had given them to eat a certain root, the taste of which resembled roasted chesnuts, and likewise a singular species of corn called <HI>maize,</HI> which, either when roasted whole or ground into meal, was abundantly pala∣table;

that there seemed to be no four-footed ani∣mals in the country, but a species of dogs, which could not bark, and a creature resembling a rabbit, but of a much smaller size; that they had observed some ornaments of gold among the people, but of no great value<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 24—28.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His con∣jectures with regard to it.</NOTE>THESE messengers had prevailed with some of the natives to accompany them, who informed Co∣lumbus, that the gold of which they made their ornaments was found in <HI>Cubanacan.</HI> By this word they meant the middle or inland part of Cuba; but Columbus, being ignorant of their language, as well as unaccustomed to their pronunciation, and his thoughts running continually upon his own theory concerning the discovery of the East Indies, he was led, by the resemblance of sound, to sup∣pose that they spoke of the Great Khan, and ima∣gined that the opulent kingdom of <HI>Cathay,</HI> de∣scribed by Marco Polo, was not very remote. This induced him to employ some time in viewing the country. He visited almost every harbour, from Porto del Principe, on the north coast of Cuba, to the eastern extremity of the island: but, though delighted with the beauty of the scenes which every where presented themselves, and amazed at the luxuriant fertility of the soil, both which, from their novelty, made a more lively impression upon his imagination<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XIV.</NOTE>, he did not find gold in such quantity as was sufficient to satisfy either the avarice of his followers, or the ex∣pectations of the court to which he was to re∣turn. The people of the country, as much asto∣nished at his eagerness in quest of gold, as the Europeans were at their ignorance and simplicity,
<PB N="131" REF="034476_0129_0FFDD5FB0622ADC0"/>
pointed towards the east, where an island which they called Hayti was situated, in which that metal was more abundant than among them. Columbus ordered his squadron to bend its course thither; but Martin Alonso Pinzon, impatient to be the first who should take possession of the treasures which this country was supposed to contain, quit∣ted his companions, regardless of all the Admiral's signals to slacken sail until they should come up with him.</P>
<P>COLUMBUS, retarded by contrary winds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovers the island Hispaniola.</NOTE> did not reach Hayti till the sixth of December. He called the port where he first touched St. Nicholas, and the island itself Espagnola, in honour of the kingdom by which he was employed; and it is the only country, of those he had yet discovered, which has retained the name that he gave it. As he could neither meet with the Pinta, nor have any intercourse with the inhabitants, who fled in great consternation towards the woods, he soon quitted St. Nicholas, and sailing along the northern coast of the island, he entered another harbour, which he called Conception. Here he was more fortu∣nate; his people overtook a woman who was flying from them, and after treating her with great gen∣tleness, dismissed her with a present of such toys as they knew were most valued in those regions. The description which she gave to her countrymen of the humanity and wonderful qualities of the strangers; their admiration of the trinkets, which she shewed with exultation; and their eagerness to participate of the same favours; removed all their fears, and induced many of them to repair to the harbour. The strange objects which they be∣held, and the baubles, which Columbus bestowed upon them, amply gratified their curiosity and their wishes. They nearly resembled the people of Guanahani and Cuba, They were naked like

them, ignorant, and simple; and seemed to be equally unacquainted with all the arts that ap∣pear most necessary in polished societies; but they were gentle, credulous, and timid, to a degree which rendered it easy to acquire the ascendant over them, especially as their excessive admiration led them into the same error with the people of the other islands, in believing the Spaniards to be more than mortals, and descended immediately from Heaven. They possessed gold in greater abundance than their neighbours, which they readily exchanged for bells, beads or pins; and in this unequal traffic both parties were highly pleased, each considering themselves as gainers by the transaction. Here Columbus was visited by a prince or <HI>cazique</HI> of the country. He appeared with all the pomp known among a simple people, being carried in a sort of palanquin upon the shoulders of four men, and attended by many of his subjects, who served him with great respect. His deportment was grave and stately, very re∣served towards his own people, but with Columbus and the Spaniards extremely courteous. He gave the admiral some thin plates of gold, and a girdle of curious workmanship, receiving in return pre∣sents of small value, but highly acceptable to him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 32.

<P>COLUMBUS, still intent on discovering the mines which yielded gold, continued to interrogate all the natives with whom he had any intercourse, con∣cerning their situation. They concurred in point∣ing out a mountainous country, which they called <HI>Cibao,</HI> at some distance from the sea, and farther towards the east.

doubted with respect to the vicinity of the countries which he had discovered to the remote parts of Asia; and, in full expectation of reaching soon those regions which had been the object of his voy∣age, he directed his course towards the east. He put into a commodious harbour, which he called St. Thomas, and found that district to be under the government of a powerful cazique, named <HI>Guaca∣nahari,</HI> who, as he afterwards learned, was one of the five sovereigns among whom the whole island was divided. He immediately sent messengers to Columbus, who, in his name, delivered to him the present of a mask curiously fashioned, with the ears, nose, and mouth of beaten gold, and invited him to the place of his residence, near the harbour now called cape Francois, some leagues towards the east. Columbus dispatched some of his officers to visit this prince, who, as he behaved himself with greater dignity, seemed to claim more atten∣tion They returned with such favourable ac∣counts both of the country and of the people, as made Columbus impatient for that interview with Guacanahari to which he had been invited.</P>
<P>HE sailed for this purpose from St. Thomas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">One of his ships lost.</NOTE> on the twenty fourth of December, with a fair wind, and the sea perfectly calm; and as, amidst the mul∣tiplicity of his occupations, he had not shut his eyes for two days, he retired at midnight in order to take some repose, having committed the helm to the pilot with strict injunctions not to quit it for a moment. The pilot, dreading no danger, care∣lessly left the helm to an unexperienced cabin boy, and the ship, carried away by a current, was dashed against a rock. The violence of the shock awak∣ened Columbus. He ran up to the deck. There, all was confusion and despair. He alone retained presence of mind. He ordered some of the sailors to take a boat and carry out an anchor astern;
<PB N="134" REF="034476_0132_0FFDD602E8C65EA8"/>
but, instead of obeying, they made off towards the Nigna, which was about half a league distant. He then commanded the masts to be cut down, in order to lighten the ship; but all his endeavours were too late; the vessel opened near the keel, and filled so fast with water that its loss was inevi∣table. The smoothness of the sea, and the timely assistance of boats from the Nigna, enabled the crew to save their lives. As soon as the islanders heard of this disaster, they crowded to the shore, with their prince Guacanahari at their head. In∣stead of taking advantage of the distress in which they beheld the Spaniards, to attempt any thing to their detriment, they lamented their misfortune with tears of sincere condolence. Not satisfied with this unavailing expression of their sympathy, they put to sea a number of canoes, and under the di∣rection of the Spaniards, assisted in saving what∣ever could be got out of the wreck; and by the united labour of so many hands, almost every thing of value was carried ashore. As fast as the goods were landed, Guacanahari in person took charge of them. By his orders they were all deposited in one place, and armed centinels were posted, who kept the multitude at a distance, in order to pre∣vent them not only from embezzling, but from inspecting too curiously what belonged to their guests <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XV.</NOTE>. Next morning this prince visited Co∣lumbus, who was now on board the Nigna, and endeavoured to console him for his loss, by offer∣ing all that he possessed to repair it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. i. c. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Distress of Columbus.</NOTE>THE condition of Columbus was such, that he stood in need of consolation.

the first tidings of the extraordinary disco∣veries which had been made, and to pre-occupy so far the ear of their sovereign, as to rob him of the glory and reward to which he was justly intitled. There remained but one vessel, and that the smallest and most crazy of the squadron, to traverse such a vast ocean, and to carry so many men back to Eu∣rope. Each of those circumstances was alarming, and filled the mind of Columbus with the utmost solicitude. The desire of overtaking Pinzon, and of effacing the unfavourable impressions which his misrepresentations might make in Spain, made it necessary to return thither without delay.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolves to have a part of his crew in the i∣sland.</NOTE> The difficulty of taking such a number of persons aboard the Nigna, confirmed him in an opinion, which the fertility of the country, and the gentle temper of the people, had already induced him to form. He resolved to leave a part of his crew in the island, that by residing there, they might learn the lan∣guage of the natives, study their disposition, ex∣amine the nature of the country, search for mines, prepare for the commodious settlement of the co∣lony, with which he purposed to return, and thus secure and facilitate the acquisition of those advan∣tages which he expected from his discoveries. When he mentioned this to his men, all approved of the design; and from impatience under the fa∣tigue of a long voyage, from the levity natural to sailors, or from the hopes of amassing wealth in a country, which afforded such promising specimens of its riches, many offered voluntarily to be among the number of those who should remain.</P>

some curiosity to know the cause which had moved the islanders to fly with such precipitation upon the approach of his ships; the cazique in∣formed him that the country was much infested by the incursions of certain people, whom he called Carribeans, who inhabited several islands to the south east. These he described as a fierce and warlike race of men, who delighted in blood, and devoured the flesh of the prisoners who were so unhappy as to fall into their hands; and as the Spaniards, at their first appearance, were supposed to be Carribeans, whom the natives, however nu∣merous, durst not face in battle, they had recourse to their usual method of securing their safety, by flying into the thickest and most impenetrable woods. Guacanahari, while speaking of those dreadful invaders, discovered such symptoms of terror, as well as such consciousness of the inability of his own people to resist them, as led Co∣lumbus to conclude that he would not be alarmed at the proposition of any scheme which afforded him the prospect of an additional security against their attacks. He instantly offered him the assist∣ance of the Spaniards to repel his enemies; he en∣gaged to take him and his people under the pro∣tection of the powerful monarch whom he served, and offered to leave in the island such a number of his men as should be sufficient, not only to defend the inhabitants from future incursions, but to avenge their past wrongs.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>THE credulous prince closed eagerly with the proposal, and thought himself already safe under the patronage of beings sprung from Heaven, and superior in power to mortal men. The ground was marked out for a small sort, which Columbus called Navidad, because he had landed there on Christmas day. A deep ditch was drawn around it. The ramparts were fortified with pallisades,
<PB N="137" REF="034476_0135_0FFDD60ADBA20150"/>
and the great guns, saved out of the admiral's ship, were planted upon them. In ten days the work was finished, that simple race of men labouring with inconsiderate assiduity in erecting this first monument of their own servitude. During this time, Columbus, by his caresses and liberality, la∣boured to increase the high opinion which the na∣tives entertained of the Spaniards. But while he endeavoured to inspire them with confidence in their disposition to do good, he wished likewise to give them some striking idea of their power to punish and destroy such as were the objects of their indignation. With this view, in presence of a vast assembly, he drew up his men in order of battle, and made an ostentatious but innocent display of the sharpness of the Spanish swords, of the force of their spears, and the operation of their cross-bows. These rude people, strangers to the use of iron, and unacquainted with any hostile weapons, but arrows of reeds pointed with the bones of fishes, wooden swords and javelins hardened in the fire, wondered and trembled. Before this surprise or fear had time to abate, he ordered the great guns to be fired. The sudden explosion struck them with such terror that they fell flat to the ground, covering their faces with their hands; and when they beheld the astonishing effect of the bullets among the trees, towards which the cannon had been pointed, they concluded that it was impossible to resist men, who had the command of such de∣structive instruments, and who came armed with thunder and lightning against their enemies.</P>
<P>AFTER giving such impressions both of the be∣neficence and power of the Spaniards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His instruc∣tions to those he left in it.</NOTE> as might have rendered it easy to preserve an ascendant over the minds of the natives, Columbus appointed thirty-eight of his people to remain in the island.

Arado, a gentleman of Cordova, investing him with the same powers which he himself had re∣ceived from Ferdinand and Isabella; and furnished him with every thing requisite for the subsistence or defence of this infant colony. He strictly en∣joined them to maintain concord among themselves, to yield an unreserved obedience to their com∣mander, to avoid giving offence to the natives by any violence or exaction, to cultivate the friend∣ship of Guacanahari, but not to put themselves in his power, by straggling in small parties, or march∣ing too far from the fort. He promised to revisit them soon, with such a reinforcement of strength as might enable them to take full possession of the country, and to reap all the fruits of their disco∣veries. In the mean time, he engaged to mention their names to the king and queen, and to place their merit and services in the most advantageous light<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oviedo ap Ramusio, iii. p. 82, E. Herrera, dec. 1. lib. i. c. 20. Life of Columbus, c. 34.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HAVING thus taken every precaution for the se∣curity of the Colony, he left Navidad on the fourth of January,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1493.</NOTE> one thousand four hundred and nine∣ty-three, and steering towards the east, discovered, and gave names to most of the harbours on the northern coast of the island. On the sixth, he descried the Pinta, and soon came up with her, after a separation of more than six weeks. Pinzon endeavoured to justify his conduct, by pretending that he had been driven from his course by stress of weather, and prevented from returning by con∣trary winds. The admiral, though he still sus∣pected his perfidious intentions, and knew well what he urged in his own defence to be frivolous as well as false, was so sensible that this was not a proper time for venturing upon any high strain of
<PB N="139" REF="034476_0137_0FFDD6121B530690"/>
authority, and felt such satisfaction in this junction with his consort, which delivered him from many disquieting apprehensions, that lame as Pinzon's apology was, he admitted of it without difficulty and restored him to favour. During his absence from the admiral, Pinzon had visited several har∣bours in the island, had acquired some gold by trafficking with the natives, but had made no dis∣covery of any importance.</P>
<P>FROM the condition of his ships,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolves to return to Europe.</NOTE> as well as the temper of his men, Columbus now found it ne∣cessary to hasten his return to Europe. The for∣mer, having suffered much during a voyage of such an unusual length, were extremely leaky. The latter expressed the utmost impatience to revisit their native country, from which they had been so long absent, and where they had things so wonderful and unheard of to relate. Accordingly, on the sixteenth of January, he directed his course to∣wards the north-east, and soon lost sight of land. He had on board some of the natives, whom he had taken from the different islands which he dis∣covered; and besides the gold, which was the chief object of research, he had collected specimens of all the productions which were likely to become subjects of commerce in the several countries, as well as many unknown birds, and other natural curiosities, which might attract the attention of the learned, or excite the wonder of the people. The voyage was prosperous to the fourteenth of Febru∣ary, and he had advanced near five hundred leagues across the Atlantic Ocean,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A violent storm ari∣ses.</NOTE> when the wind began to rise, and continued to blow with increasing rage, which terminated in a furious hurricane. Every thing that the naval skill and experience of Colum∣bus could devise was employed, in order to save the ships. But it was impossible to withstand the violence of the storm, and, as they were still far

from any land, destruction seemed inevitable. The sailors had recourse to prayers to Almighty God, to the invocation of saints, to vows and charms, to every thing that religion dictates, or superstition suggests, to the affrighted mind of man. No prospect of deliverance appearing, they abandoned themselves to despair, and expected every moment to be swallowed up in the waves. Besides the pas∣sions which naturally agitate and alarm the human mind in such awful situations, when certain death, in one of his most terrible forms, is before it, Co∣lumbus had to endure feelings of distress peculiar to himself.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The con∣duct of Columbus.</NOTE> He dreaded that all knowledge of the amazing discoveries which he had made was now to perish; mankind were to be deprived of every benefit that might have been derived from the happy success of his schemes, and his own name would descend to posterity as that of a rash deluded adventurer, instead of being transmitted with the honor due to the author and conductor of the most noble enterprize that had ever been under∣taken. These reflections extinguished all sense of his own personal danger. Less affected with the loss of life, than solicitous to preserve the memory of what he had attempted and atchieved, he retired to his cabin, and wrote upon parchment, a short account of the voyage which he had made, of the course which he had taken, of the situation and riches of the countries which he had discovered, and of the colony that he had left there. Having wrapped up this in an oiled cloth, which he in∣closed in a cake of wax, he put it into a cask care∣fully stopped up, and threw it into the sea, in hopes that some fortunate accident might preserve a de∣posit of so much importance to the world<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 37.

The wind abated, the sea became calm,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes shelter in the Azores.</NOTE> and on the evening of the fif∣teenth, Columbus and his companions discovered land; and though uncertain what it was, they made towards it. They soon knew it to be St. Mary, one of the Azores or western isles, subject to the crown of Portugal. There, after a violent con∣test with the governor, in which Columbus dis∣played no less spirit than prudence, he obtained a supply of fresh provisions, and whatever else he needed. One circumstance, however, greatly dis∣quieted him. The Pinta, of which he had lost sight on the first day of the hurricane, did not appear; he dreaded for some time that she had foundered at sea, and that all her crew had perish∣ed: afterwards, his former suspicions recurred, and he became apprehensive that Pinzon had borne away for Spain, that he might reach it before him, and, by giving the first account of his discoveries, might obtain some share of his fame.</P>
<P>IN order to prevent this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 24. Arrives at Lisbon.</NOTE> he left the Azores as soon as the weather would permit. At no great distance from the coast of Spain, when near the end of his voyage, and seemingly beyond the reach of any disaster, another storm arose, little inferior to the former in violence; and after driv∣ing before it during two days and two nights, he was forced to take shelter in the river Tagus.<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 4.</NOTE> Upon application to the king of Portugal, he was allowed to come up to Lisbon; and, notwithstand∣ing the envy which it was natural for the Portuguese to feel, when they beheld another nation entering upon that province of discovery which they had hitherto deemed peculiarly their own, and in its first essay, not only rivalling, but eclipsing their fame, Columbus was received with all the marks of distinction due to a man who had performed

things so extraordinary and unexpected. The king admitted him into his presence, treated him with the highest respect, and listened to the ac∣count which he gave of his voyage with admiration mingled with regret. While Columbus, on his part, enjoyed the satisfaction of describing the importance of his discoveries, and of being now able to prove the solidity of his schemes to those very persons, who, with an ignorance disgraceful to themselves, and fatal to their country, had lately rejected them as the projects of a visionary or de∣signing adventurer.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 40, 41.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to Spain.</NOTE>COLUMBUS was so impatient to return to Spain, that he remained only five days in Lisbon. On the fifteenth of March he arrived in the port of Palos, seven months and eleven days from the time when he set out thence upon his voyage. As soon as the ship was discovered approaching the port, all the inhabitants of Palos ran eagerly to the shore, in order to welcome their relations and fellow-citizens, and to hear tidings of their voyage. When the prosperous issue of it was known, when they beheld the strange people, the unknown animals, and singular productions brought from the countries which had been discovered, the effusions of joy was general and unbounded. The bells were rung, the cannon fired; Columbus was received at landing with royal honours, and all the people, in solemn procession, accompanied him and his crew to the church, where they returned thanks to Heaven, which had so wonderfully conducted and crowned with success, a voyage of greater length and of more importance, than had been at∣tempted in any former age. On the evening of the same day, he had the satisfaction of seeing the Pinta, which the violence of the tempest had driven far to the north, enter the harbour.</P>
<P><PB N="143" REF="034476_0141_0FFDD61AA6F119D8"/>THE first care of Columbus was to inform the king and queen, who were then at Barcelona, of his arrival and success. Ferdinand and Isabella,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His reception there.</NOTE> no less astonished than delighted with this unex∣pected event, desired Columbus, in terms the most respectful and flattering, to repair immedi∣ately to court, that from his own mouth they might receive a full detail of his extraordinary services and discoveries. During his journey to Barcelona, the people crowded from the adjacent country, following him every where with admira∣tion and applause. His entrance into the city was conducted, by order of Ferdinand and Isabella, with pomp suitable to the great event, which added such distinguishing lustre to their reign. The people whom he brought along with him from the countries which he had discovered, marched first, and by their singular complexion, the wild pecu∣liarity of their features, and uncouth finery, ap∣peared like men of another species. Next to them were carried the ornaments of gold, fashioned by the rude art of the natives, the grains of gold found in the mountains, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>st of the same metal gathered in the rivers. After these, appeared the various commodities of the new discovered countries, together with their curious productions. Columbus himself closed the procession, and at∣tracted the eyes of all the spectators, who gazed with admiration on the extraordinary man, whose superior sagacity and fortitude had conducted their countrymen, by a route concealed from past ages, to the knowledge of a new world. Ferdinand and Isabella received him clad in their royal robes, and seated upon a throne, under a magnificent canopy. When he approached, they stood up, and raising him as he kneeled to kiss their hands, com∣manded him to take his seat upon a chair prepared for him, and to give a circumstantial account of

But what pleased him most, as it gratified his active mind, bent continually upon great objects, was, an order to equip, without delay, an armament of such force, as might enable him not only to take possession of the countries which he had already discovered, but to go in search of those more opu∣lent regions, which he still confidently expected to to find<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 42, 43.

Men of science, capable of comprehend∣ing the nature, and of discerning the effects of this great discovery, received the account of it with ad∣miration and joy. They spoke of his voyage with rapture, and congratulated one another upon their felicity, in having lived in the period when, by this extraordinary event, the boundaries of human knowledge were so much extended, and such a new field of inquiry and observation opened, as would lead mankind to a perfect acquaintance with the structure and productions of the habitable globe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. Mart. epist. 133, 134, 135. See NOTE XVIII.</NOTE>. Various opinions and conjectures were formed con∣cerning the new-found countries, and what division of the earth they belonged to. Columbus adhered tenaciously to his original opinion, that they should be reckoned a part of those vast regions in Asia, comprehended under the general name of India. This sentiment was confirmed by the observations which he made concerning the productions of the countries he had discovered. Gold was known to abound in India, and he had met with such pro∣mising samples of it in the islands which he visited, as led him to believe that rich mines of it might be found. Cotton, another production of the East Indies, was common there. The pimento of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ands he imagined to be a species of the East-In∣dian pepper. He mistook a root, somewhat re∣sembling rhubarb, for that valuable drug, which was then supposed to be a plant peculiar to the East Indies<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. i. c. 20. Gomara Hist. c. 17.</NOTE>. The birds brought home by him were adorned with the same rich plumage which dis∣tinguishes those of India.

of Europe, seem to have adopted the opinion of Columbus. The countries which he had disco∣vered were considered as a part of India. In con∣sequence of this notion, the name of Indies is given to them by Ferdinand and Isabella, in a ratification of their former agreement, which was granted to Columbus upon his return<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 44</NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Preparati∣ons for a second voy∣age.</NOTE>THE names by which Columbus distinguished the countries which he had discovered was so in∣viting, the specimens of their riches and fertility, which he produced were so considerable, and the reports of his companions, delivered frequently with the exaggeration natural to travellers, so fa∣vourable, as to excite a wonderful spirit of enter∣prise among the Spaniards. Though little ac∣customed to naval expeditions, they were impatient to set out upon the voyage. Volunteers of every rank solicited to be employed. Allured by the inviting prospects which opened to their ambition and avarice, neither the length nor danger of the navigation intimidated them. Cautious as Ferdi∣nand was, and averse to every thing new or adven∣turous, he seems to have catched the same spirit with his subjects. Under its influence, prepara∣tions for a second expedition were carried on with a rapidity unusual in Spain, and to an extent that would be deemed not inconsiderable in the present age. The fleet consisted of seventeen ships, some of which were of good burden. It had on board fifteen hundred persons, among whom were many
<PB N="147" REF="034476_0145_0FFDD62625A92CA0"/>
of noble families, who had served in honourable stations. The greater part of these being destined to remain in the country, were furnished with every thing requisite for conquest or settlement, with all kinds of European domestic animals, with such seeds and plants as were most likely to thrive in the climate of the West-Indies, with utensils and instruments of every sort, and with such artificers as might be most useful in an infant colony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 5. Life of Columbus, c. 45.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The right of Spain to the New World con∣firmed by the Pope.</NOTE> formidable and well-provided as this fleet was, Ferdinand and Isabella did not rest their title to the possession of the newly-discovered countries upon its operations alone. The example of the Portuguese, as well as the superstition of the age, made it necessary to obtain from the Roman Pontiff a grant of those territories which they wished to occupy. The Pope, as the vicar and representa∣tive of Jesus Christ, was supposed to have a right of dominion over all the kingdoms of the earth. Alexander VI. a pontiff infamous for every crime which disgraces humanity, filled the papal throne at that time. As he was born Ferdinand's subject, and very solicitous to secure the protection of Spain, in order to facilitate the execution of his ambitious schemes in favour of his own family, he was ex∣tremely willing to gratify the Spanish monarchs. By an act of liberality which cost him nothing, and that served to establish the jurisdiction and preten∣sions of the papal see, he granted in full right to Ferdinand and Isabella all the countries inhabited by Infidels, which they had discovered, or should discover; and, in virtue of that power which he derived from Jesus Christ, he conferred on the crown of Castile vast regions, to the possession of which he himself was so far from having any title, that he was unacquainted with their situation,
<PB N="148" REF="034476_0146_0FFDD628BA9EA338"/>
and ignorant even of their existence. As it was necessary to prevent this grant from interfering with that formerly made to the crown of Por∣tugal, he appointed that a line, supposed to be drawn from pole to pole, a hundred leagues to the west∣ward of the Azores, should serve as a limit be∣tween them; and in the plenitude of his power, bestowed all to the east of this imaginary line upon the Portuguese, and all to the west of it, upon the Spaniards<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 4. Torquemeda Mon. Ind. lib. xviii. c. 3.</NOTE>. Zeal for propagating the Christian faith was the consideration employed by Ferdinand in soliciting this bull, and is mentioned by Alex∣ander as his chief motive for issuing it. In order to manifest some concern for this laudable object, several friars, under the direction of Father Boyl, a Catalonian monk of great reputation, as aposto∣lical vicar, were appointed to accompany Colum∣bus, and to devote themselves to the instruction of the natives. The Indians, whom Columbus had brought along with him, having received some tincture of Christian knowledge, were baptized with much solemnity, the king himself, the prince his son, and the chief persons of his court, standing as their godfathers. Those first fruits of the New World have not been followed by such an increase as pious men wished, and had reason to expect.</P>

of September, and touching again at the island of Gomera, he steered farther towards the south than in his former voyage. By holding this course, he enjoyed more steadily the benefit of the regu∣lar winds, which reign within the tropics, and was carried towards a large cluster of islands, situated considerably to the east of those which he had al∣ready discovered.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 2.</NOTE> On the twenty-sixth day after his departure from Gomera, he made land<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oviedo ap. Ramus. iii. 85. B.</NOTE>. It was one of the Caribbee or Leeward islands, to which he gave the name of Deseada, on account of the impatience of his crew to discover some part of the New World. After this he visited succes∣sively Dominica, Marigalante, Guadaloupe, Antigua, San Juan de Puerto Rico, and several other islands, scattered in his way as he advanced towards the north-west. All these he found to be inhabited by that fierce race of people whom Guacanahari had painted in such frightful colours. His descriptions appeared not to have been exaggerated. The Spaniards never attempted to land without meeting with such a reception, as discovered the martial and daring spirit of the natives; and in their ha∣bitations were found relics of those horrid feasts which they had made upon the bodies of their ene∣mies taken in war.</P>
<P>BUT as Columbus was eager to know the state of the colony which he had planted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrives at Hispaniola Nov. 22.</NOTE> and to supply it with the necessaries of which he supposed it to be in want, he made no stay in any of those islands, and proceeded directly to Hispaniola<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P.

But the fort which he had built was entirely demolished, and the tattered garments, the broken arms and utensils scattered about it, left no room to doubt concerning the unhappy fate of the garrison <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. de Cura de los Palacios. MS.</NOTE>. While the Spaniards were shedding tears over those sad memorials of their fellow-citi∣zens, a brother of the cazique Guacanahari arrived. From him Columbus received a particular detail of what had happened after his departure from the island.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The fate of the men whom he left there</NOTE> The familiar intercourse of the Indians with the Spaniards tended gradually to diminish the superstitious veneration with which their first ap∣pearance had inspired that simple people. By their own indiscretion and ill conduct, the Spaniards speedily effaced those favourable impressions, and soon convinced the natives, that they had all the wants, and weaknesses, and passions of men. As soon as the powerful restraint which the presence and authority of Columbus imposed was withdrawn, the garrison threw off all regard for the officer whom he had invested with command. Regardless of the prudent instructions which he had given them, every man became independent, and gra∣tified his desires without control. The gold, the women, the provisions of the natives, were all the prey of those licentious oppressors. They roamed in small parties over the island, extending their ra∣pacity and insolence to every corner of it. Gentle and timid as the people were, those unprovoked injuries at length exhausted their patience, and rouzed their courage. The cazique of Cibao,
<PB N="151" REF="034476_0149_0FFDC5303B396C38"/>
whose country the Spaniards chiefly infested on account of the gold which it contained, surprised and cut off several of them, while they straggled in as perfect security as if their conduct had been al∣together inoffensive. He then assembled his sub∣jects, and surrounding the fort, set it on fire. Some of the Spaniards were killed in defending it, the rest perished in attempting to make their escape by crossing an arm of the sea. Guacanahari, whom all their exactions had not alienated from the Spa∣niards, took arms in their behalf, and, in endeavour∣ing to protect them, had received a wound, by which he was still confined <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His prudent conduct.</NOTE>THOUGH this account was far from removing the suspicions which the Spaniards entertained with re∣spect to the fidelity of Guacanahari, Columbus per∣ceived so clearly that this was not a proper juncture for inquiring into his conduct with scrupulous ac∣curacy, that he rejected the advice of several of his officers, who urged him to seize the person of that prince, and to revenge the death of their country∣men by attacking his subjects. He represented to them the necessity of securing the friendship of some potentate of the country, in order to facilitate the settlement which they intended, and the danger of driving the natives to unite in some desperate attempt against them, by such an ill-timed and un∣availing exercise of rigour. Instead of wasting his time in punishing past wrongs, he took precautions for preventing any future injury. With this view he made choice of a situation more healthy and commodious than that of Navidad. He traced out the plan of a town in a large plain near a spa∣cious bay, and obliging every person to put his hand to work on which their common safety de∣pended,

the houses and ramparts were soon so far advanced by their united labour, as to afford them shelter and security. This rising city, the first that the Europeans founded in the New World, he named Isabella, in honour of his patroness the queen of Castile <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 51. Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Discontent of his fol∣lowers.</NOTE>IN carrying on this necessary work, Columbus had not only to sustain all the hardships, and to en∣counter all the difficulties, to which infant colonies are exposed when they settle in an uncultivated country, but he had to contend with what was more insuperable, the laziness, the impatience, and mutinous disposition of his followers. By the enervating influence of a hot climate, the natural in∣activity of the Spaniards seemed to increase. Many of them were gentlemen, unaccustomed to the fa∣tigue of bodily labour, and all had engaged in the enterprise with the sanguine hopes excited by the splendid and exaggerated description of their coun∣trymen who returned from the first voyage, or by the mistaken opinion of Columbus, that the country which he had discovered was either the Cipango of Marco Polo, or the Ophir<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. Martyr, dec. p. 29.</NOTE>, from which Solomon imported those precious commodities which sud∣denly diffused such extraordinary riches through his kingdom. But when, instead of that golden harvest which they had expected to reap without toil or pains, the Spaniards saw that their prospect of wealth was remote as well as uncertain, and that it could not be attained but by the slow and persever∣ing efforts of industry, the disappointment of those chimerical hopes occasioned such dejection of mind as bordered on despair, and led to general discon∣tent. In vain did Columbus endeavour to revive their spirits, by pointing out the fertility of the soil,
<PB N="153" REF="034476_0151_0FFDD52CBA6E1D58"/>
and exhibiting the specimens of gold daily brought in from different parts of the island. They had not patience to wait for the gradual returns which the former might yield, and the latter they de∣spised as scanty and inconsiderable. The spirit of disaffection spread, and a conspiracy was formed, which might have been fatal to Columbus and the colony. Happily he discovered it, and seizing the ringleaders, punished some of them, sent others prisoners into Spain, whither he dispatched twelve of the ships which had served as transports, with an earnest request for a reinforcement of men and a large supply of provisions.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 10, 11.</NOTE></P>
<P>MEANWHILE,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1494. Examines into the state of the coun∣try.</NOTE> in order to banish that idleness which, by allowing his people leisure to brood over their disappointments, nourished the spirit of dis∣content, Columbus planned several expeditions into the interior parts of the country. He sent a de∣tachment, under the command of Alonso de Ojeda, a vigilant and enterprising officer, to visit the di∣strict of Cibao, which was said to yield the greatest quantity of gold, and followed him in person with the main body of his troops. In this expedition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 12.</NOTE>
he displayed all the pomp of military magnificence that he could exhibit, in order to strike the ima∣gination of the natives. He marched with colours flying, with martial music, and with a small body of cavalry that paraded sometimes in the front, and sometimes in the rear. As those were the first horses which appeared in the New World, they were objects of terror no less than of admiration to the Indians, who having no tame animals them∣selves, were unacquainted with that vast accession of power, which man hath acquired by subjecting them to his dominion. They supposed them to be rational creatures. They imagined that the horse
<PB N="154" REF="034476_0152_0FFDD52E8CDB6D78"/>
and the rider formed one animal, with whose speed they were astonished, and whose impetuosity and strength they considered as irresistible. But while Columbus endeavoured to inspire the natives with a dread of his power, he did not neglect the arts of gaining their love and confidence. He ad∣hered scrupulously to the principles of integrity and justice in all his transactions with them, and treated them on every occasion, not only with humanity, but with indulgence. The district of Cibao an∣swered the description given of it by the natives. It was mountainous and uncultivated, but in every river and brook gold was gathered either in dust or in grains, some of which were of considerable size. The Indians had never opened any mines in search of gold. To penetrate into the bowels of the earth, and to refine the rude ore, were opera∣tions too complicated and laborious for their talents and industry, and they had no such high value for gold as to put their ingenuity and invention upon the stretch in order to obtain it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oviedo, lib. ii. p. 90. A.</NOTE>. The small quan∣tity of that precious metal which they possessed, was either picked up in the beds of the rivers, or washed from the mountains by the heavy rains that fall within the tropics. But, from those indica∣tions, the Spaniards could no longer doubt that the country contained rich treasures in its bowels, of which they hoped soon to be masters<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pet. Martyr, dec. p. 32.</NOTE>. In order to secure the command of this valuable province, Columbus erected a small fort to which he gave the name of St. Thomas, by way of ridicule upon some of his incredulous followers, who would not believe that the country produced gold, until they saw it with their own eyes, and touched it with their hands<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 12. Life of Columbus, c. 52.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="034476_0153_0FFDD5332A2D5918"/>THE account of those promising appearances of wealth in the country of Cibao came very season∣ably to comfort the desponding colony, which was affected with distresses of various kinds.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The distress and disaf∣fection of the colony increase.</NOTE> The stock of provisions which had been brought from Europe was mostly consumed; what remained was so much corrupted by the heat and moisture of the climate, as to be almost unfit for use; the natives cultivated so small a portion of ground, and with so little skill, that it hardly yielded what was suffi∣cient for their own subsistence; the Spaniards at Isabella had hitherto neither time nor leisure to clear the soil, so as to reap any considerable fruits of their own industry. On all these accounts, they became afraid of perishing with hunger, and were reduced already to a scanty allowance. At the same time, the diseases predominant in the torrid zone, and which rage chiefly in those uncultivated countries, where the hand of industry has not open∣ed the woods, drained the marshes, and confined the rivers within a certain channel, began to spread among them. Alarmed at the violence and un∣usual symptoms of those maladies, they exclaimed against Columbus and his companions in the for∣mer voyage, who, by their splendid but deceitful descriptions of Hispaniola, had allured them to quit Spain for a barbarous uncultivated land, where they must either be cut off by famine, or die of unknown distempers. Several of the officers and persons of note, instead of checking, joined in those seditious complaints. Father Boyl, the apostolical vicar, was one of the most turbulent and outrage∣ous. It required all the authority and address of Columbus to re-establish subordination and tran∣quility in the colony. Threats and promises were alternately employed for this purpose; but nothing contributed more to sooth the malcontents, than the prospect of finding, in the mines of Cibao, such
<PB N="156" REF="034476_0154_0FFDD534C00DF638"/>
a rich store of treasure as would be a recompence for all their sufferings, and efface the memory of former disappointments.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Columbus attempts new disco¦veries.</NOTE>WHEN, by his unwearied endeavours, concord and order were so far restored, that he could ven∣ture to leave the island, Columbus resolved to pur∣sue his discoveries, that he might be able to ascer∣tain whether those new countries with which he had opened a communication were connected with any region of the earth already known, or whe∣ther they were to be considered as a separate por∣tion of the globe hitherto unvisited. He appointed his brother Don Diego, with the assistance of a council of officers, to govern the island in his ab∣sence; and gave the command of a body of soldiers to Don Pedro Margarita, with which he was to visit the different parts of the island and endeavour to establish the authority of the Spaniards among the inhabitants. Having left them very particu∣lar instructions with respect to their conduct, he weighed anchor on the twenty-fourth of April, with one ship and two small barks under his com∣mand. During a tedious voyage of full five months, he had a trial of almost all the numerous hardships to which persons of his profession are ex∣posed, without making any discovery of importance, except the island of Jamaica. As he ranged along the southern coast of Cuba <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XIX.</NOTE>, he was entangled in a labyrinth formed by an incredible number of small islands, to which he gave the name of the Queen's Garden. In this unknown course, among rocks and shelves, he was retarded by contrary winds, assaulted with furious storms, and alarmed with the terrible thunder and lightning which is often almost incessant between the tropics. At length his provisions fell short; his crew, exhausted

Beset with dan∣ger in such various forms, he was obliged to keep continual watch, to observe every occurrence with his own eyes, to issue every order, and to superin∣tend the execution of it. On no occasion, was the extent of his skill and experience as a navigator so much tried. To these the squadron owed its safety. But this unremitted fatigue of body, and intense application of mind, overpowering his constitution, though naturally vigorous and robust, brought on a feverish disorder, which terminated in a lethargy, that deprived him of sense and memory, and had almost proved fatal to his life <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 54, &amp;c.

<P>BUT, on his return to Hispaniola,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sept. 27. On his re∣turn, finds his brother Bartholo∣mew at Isabella.</NOTE> the sudden emotion of joy which he felt upon meeting with his brother Bartholomew at Isabella, occasioned such a flow of spirits as contributed greatly to his recovery. It was now thirteen years since the two brothers, whom similarity of talents united in close friendship, had separated from each other, and du∣ring that long period there had been no intercourse between them. Bartholomew, after finishing his negociation in the court of England, had set out for Spain by the way of France. At Paris he re∣ceived an account of the extraordinary discoveries which his brother had made in his first voyage, and that he was then preparing to embark on a second expedition. Though this naturally induced him to pursue his journey with the utmost dispatch, the admiral had sailed for Hispaniola before he reached Spain. Ferdinand and Isabella received him with the respect due to the nearest kinsman of a person whose merit and services rendered him so conspi∣cuous;
<PB N="158" REF="034476_0156_0FFDD538FAE9B9E0"/>
and as they knew what consolation his pre∣sence would afford to his brother, they persuaded him to take the command of three ships, which they had appointed to carry provisions to the co∣lony at Isabella <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 15.</NOTE>.</P>

For although the provisions now brought from Europe, afforded a temporary relief to the Spani∣ards from the calamities of famine, the supply was not in such quantity as to support them long, and the island did not hitherto yield what was sufficient for their sustenance. They were threatened with another danger, still more formidable than the re∣turn of scarcity, and which demanded more imme∣diate attention. No sooner did Columbus leave the island on his voyage of discovery, than the soldiers under Margarita, as if they had been set free from discipline and subordination, scorned all restraint. Instead of conforming to the prudent instructions of Columbus, they dispersed in straggling parties over the island, lived at discretion upon the natives, wasted their provisions, seized their women, and treated that inoffensive race with all the insolence of military oppression<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">P. Martyr, dec. p. 47.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS long as the Indians had any prospect that their sufferings might come to a period by the vo∣luntary departure of the invaders, they submitted in silence, and dissembled their sorrow; but they now perceived that the yoke would be as permanent as it was intolerable. The Spaniards had built a town, and surrounded it with ramparts. They had erected sorts in different places. They had
<PB N="159" REF="034476_0157_0FFDD53CA06E5670"/>
enclosed and sown several fields. It was apparent that they came not to visit the country, but to set∣tle in it. Though the number of those strangers was inconsiderable, the state of cultivation among this rude people was so imperfect, and in such exact proportion to their own consumption, that it was with difficulty they could afford subsistence to their new guests. Their own mode of life was so indolent and inactive, the warmth of the climate so enervating, the constitution of their bodies naturally so feeble, and so unaccustomed to the laborious exertions of industry, that they were satisfied with a proportion of food amazingly small. A handful of maize, or a little of the insipid bread made of the cassada-root, was sufficient to support men, whose strength and spirits were not exhausted by any vigorous efforts either of body or mind. The Spaniards, though the most abstemious of all the European nations, appeared to them excessively voracious. One Spaniard consumed as much as several Indians. This keenness of appetite surprised them so much, and seemed to be so infatiable, that they supposed the Spaniards had left their own country, because it did not produce as much as was requisite to gra∣tify their immoderate desire of food, and had come among them in quest of nourishment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 17.</NOTE>. Self-pre∣servation prompted them to wish for the departure of guests who wasted so fast their slender stock of provisions. The injuries which they suffered, ad∣ded to their impatience for this event. They had long expected that the Spaniards would retire of their own accord. They now perceived that, in order to avert the destruction with which they were threatened, either by the slow consumption of fa∣mine, or by the violence of their oppressors, it was necessary to assume courage to attack those formi∣dable

invaders with united force, and drive them from the settlements of which they had violently taken possession.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">War with them.</NOTE>SUCH were the sentiments which universally pre∣vailed among the Indians, when Columbus re∣turned to Isabella. Inflamed by the unprovoked outrages of the Spaniards, with a degree of rage of which their gentle natures, formed to suffer and submit, seemed hardly susceptible, they waited only for a signal from their leaders to fall upon the co∣lony. Some of the caziques had already surprised and cut off several stragglers. The dread of this impending danger united the Spaniards, and re∣established the authority of Columbus, as they saw no prospect of safety but in committing themselves to his prudent guidance. It was now necessary to have recourse to arms, the employing of which against the Indians, Columbus had hitherto avoided with the greatest solicitude. Unequal as the con∣flict may seem, between the naked inhabitants of the New World, armed with clubs, sticks hard∣ened in the fire, wooden swords, and arrows pointed with bones or flints; and troops accustomed to the discipline, and provided with the instruments of destruction known in the European art of war, the situation of the Spaniards was far from being exempt from danger. The vast superiority of the natives in number, compensated many defects. An hand∣ful of men was about to encounter a whole nation. One adverse event, or even any unforeseen delay in determining the fate of the war, might prove fatal to the Spaniards. Conscious that success de∣pended on the vigour and rapidity of his operations, Columbus instantly assembled his forces. They were reduced to a very small number. Diseases, engendered by the warmth and humidity of the country, or occasioned by their own licentiousness, had raged among them with much violence; ex∣perience

All the caziques of the island, Guacahanari excepted, who retained an inviolable attachment to the Spaniards, were in arms to oppose Columbus, with forces amounting, if we may believe the Spa∣nish historians, to a hundred thousand men. In∣stead of attempting to draw the Spaniards into the fastnesses of the woods and mountains, they were so imprudent as to take their station in the Vega Real, the most open plain in the country. Columbus did not allow them time to perceive their error, or to alter their position. He attacked them during the night, when undisciplined troops are least capable of acting with union and concert, and obtained an easy and bloodless victory. The consternation with which the Indians were filled by the noise and havock made by the fire-arms, by the impe∣tuous force of the cavalry, and the fierce onset of the dogs, was so great, that they threw down their weapons, and fled without attempting resistance. Many were slain; more were taken prisoners, and reduced to servitude<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XX.</NOTE>; and so thoroughly were the rest intimidated, that from that moment they abandoned themselves to despair, relinquishing all thoughts of contending with aggressors whom they deemed invincible.</P>

Each per∣son who lived in those districts where gold was found, was obliged to pay quarterly as much gold dust as filled a hawk's bell; from those in other parts of the country, twenty-five pounds of cotton were demanded. This was the first regular taxa∣tion of the Indians, and served as a precedent for exactions still more intolerable. Such an imposi∣tion was extremely contrary to those maxims which Columbus had hitherto inculcated, with respect to the mode of treating them. But intrigues were carrying on in the court of Spain at this juncture, in order to undetermine his power, and discredit his operations, which constrained him to depart from his own system of administration. Several unfa∣vourable accounts of his conduct, as well as of the countries discovered by him, had been transmitted to Spain. Margarita and Father Boyl were now at court; and in order to justify their own conduct, or to gratify their resentment, watched with male∣volent attention for every opportunity of spreading insinuations to his detriment. Many of the cour∣tiers viewed his growing reputation and power with envious eyes. Fonseca, archdeacon of Seville, who was entrusted with the chief direction of In∣dian affairs, had conceived such an unfavourable opinion of Columbus, for some reason which the contemporary writers have not mentioned, that he listened with partiality to every invective against him. It was not easy for an unfriended stranger, unpractised in courtly arts, to counteract the ma∣chinations of so many enemies. Columbus saw that there was but one method of supporting his own credit, and of silencing all his adversaries. He

must produce such a quantity of gold as would not only justify what he had reported with respect to the richness of the country, but encourage Fer∣dinand and Isabella to persevere in prosecuting his plans. The necessary of obtaining it, forced him not only to impose this <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> tax upon the In∣dians, but to exact payment of it with extreme ri∣gour; and may be pleaded in excuse for his de∣viating on this occasion from the mildness and humanity with which he uniformly treated that un∣happy people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE labour, attention and foresight,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fatal ef∣fects of that mea∣sure.</NOTE> which the Indians were obliged to employ in procuring the tribute demanded of them, appeared the most in∣tolerable of all evils, to men accustomed to pass their days in a careless, improvident indolence. They were incapable of such a regular and perse∣vering exertion of industry, and felt it such a grie∣vous restraint upon their liberty, that they had recourse to an expedient for obtaining deliverance from this yoke, which demonstrates the excess of their impatience and despair. They formed a scheme of starving those oppressors whom they durst not attempt to expel; and from the opinion which they entertained with respect to the vora∣cious appetite of the Spaniards, they concluded the execution of it to be very practicable. With this view they suspended all the operations of agriculture; they sowed no maize, they pulled up the roots of the manioc or cassada which were planted, and re∣tiring to the most inaccessible parts of the moun∣tains, left the uncultivated plains to their enemies. This desperate resolution produced in some degree the effects which they expected. The Spaniards were reduced to extreme want; but they received such seasonable supplies of provisions from Europe,

and found so many resources in their own ingenuity and industry, that they suffered no great loss of men. The wretched Indians were the victims of their own ill-concerted policy. A great multitude of people, shut up in the mountainous or wooded part of the country, without any food but the spon∣taneous productions of the earth, soon felt the ut∣most distresses of famine. This brought on conta∣gious diseases; and, in the course of a few months, more than a third part of the inhabitants of the island perished, after experiencing misery in all its various forms<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. xi. c. 18.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Intrigues against Co∣lumbus in the court of Spain.</NOTE>BUT while Columbus was establishing the found∣ations of the Spanish grandeur in the New World, his enemies laboured with unwearied assiduity to deprive him of the glory and rewards, which by his services and sufferings he was entitled to enjoy. The hardships unavoidable in a new settlement, the calamities occasined by an unhealthy climate, the disasters attending a voyage in unknown seas, were all represented as the effects of his restless and inconsiderate ambition. His prudent attention to preserve discipline and subordination was deno∣minated excess of rigour; the punishments which he inflicted upon the mutinous and disorderly were imputed to cruelty. These accusations gained such credit in a jealous court, that a commissioner was appointed to repair to Hispaniola, and to inspect into the conduct of Columbus. By the recom∣mendation of his enemies, Aguado, a groom of the bed-chamber, was the person to whom this import∣ant trust was committed. But in this choice they seem to have been more influenced by the obse∣quious attachment of the man to their interest,
<PB N="165" REF="034476_0163_0FFDD54C77395828"/>
than by his capacity for the station.

By listening with eagerness to every accusation against Columbus, and encouraging not only the malcontent Spa∣niards, but even the Indians, to produce their grie∣vances, real or imaginary, he fomented the spirit of dissension in the island, without establishing any re∣gulation of public utility, or that tended to redress the many wrongs, with the odium of which he wished to load the admiral's administration. As Columbus felt sensibly how humiliating his situa∣tion must be, if he should remain in the country while such a partial inspector observed his motions, and controlled his jurisdiction, he took the resolu∣tion of returning to Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1496.</NOTE> in order to lay a full account of all his transactions, particularly with re∣spect to the points in dispute between him and his adversaries, before Ferdinand and Isabella, from whose justice and discernment he expected an equal and a favourable decision. He committed the ad∣ministration of affairs, during his absence, to Don Bartholomew his brother, with the title of Adelan∣tado, or Lieutenant Governor. By a choice less fortunate, and which proved the source of many calamities to the colony, he appointed Francis Roldan chief justice, with very extensive powers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 18. lib. iii. c. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN returning to Europe,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Returns to Spain.</NOTE> Columbus held a course different from that which he had taken in his for∣mer voyage. He steered almost due east from Hispaniola, in the parallel of twenty-two degrees of latitude; as experience had not yet discovered

the more certain and expeditious method of stretch∣ing to the north, in order to fall in with the south∣west winds. By this ill-advised choice, which, in the infancy of navigation between the New and Old Worlds, can hardly be imputed to the admi∣ral as a defect in naval skill, he was exposed to in∣finite fatigue and danger, in a perpetual struggle with the trade-winds, which blow without varia∣tion from the east between the tropics. Notwith∣standing the almost insuperable difficulties of such a navigation, he persisted in his course with his usual patience and firmness, but made so little way, that he was three months without seeing land. At length his provisions began to fail, the crew was reduced to the scanty allowance of six ounces of bread a-day for each peson. The admiral fared no better than the meanest sailor. But, even in this extreme distress, he retained the humanity which distinguishes his character, and refused to comply with the earnest solicitations of his crew, some of whom proposed to feed upon the Indian prisoners whom <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> were carrying over, and others insisted to throw them over-board, in order to lessen the consumption of their small stock. He represented that they were human beings, reduced by a common calamity to the same condition with themselves, and entitled to share an equal fate. His authority and remonstrances dissipated those wild ideas suggested by despair. Nor had they time to recur, as he came soon within sight of the coast of Spain, when all their fears and sufferings en∣ded<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i c. 1.

own facility in lending too favourable an ear to fri∣volous or ill-founded accusations, received him with such distinguished marks of respect as co∣vered his enemies with shame. Their censures and calumnies were no more heard of at that juncture. The gold, the pearls, the cotton, and other com∣modities of value which Columbus produced, seemed fully to refute what the malcontents had propagated with respect to the poverty of the country. By reducing the Indians to obedience, and imposing a regular tax upon them, he had se∣cured to Spain a large accession of new subjects, and the establishment of a revenue that promised to be considerable. By the mines which he had found out and examined, a source of wealth still more copious was opened. Great and unexpected as those advantages were, Columbus represented them only as preludes to future acquisitions, and as the earnest of more important discoveries, which he still meditated, and to which those he had al∣ready made would conduct him with ease and cer∣tainty<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 6<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

had been the sole object of the first voyage to the New World; and though, in the second, settle∣ment had been proposed, the precautions taken for that purpose had either been insufficient, or were rendered ineffectual by the mutinous spirit of the Spaniards, and the unforeseen calamities arising from various causes. Now a plan was to be formed of a regular colony, that might serve as a model in all future establishments. Every particular was considered with attention, and the whole arranged with a scrupulous accuracy. The precise number of adventurers who should be permitted to embark was fixed. They were to be of different ranks and professions; and the proportion of each was established, according to their usefulness and the wants of the colony. A suitable number of wo∣men was to be chosen to accompany these new settlers. As it was the first object to raise provi∣sions in a country where scarcity of food had been the occasion of so much distress, a considerable body of husbandmen was to be carried over. As the Spaniards had then no conception of deriving any benefit from those productions of the New World which have since yielded such large returns of wealth to Europe, but had formed magnificent ideas, and entertained sanguine hopes with respect to the riches contained in the mines which had been discovered, a band of workmen, skilled in the various arts employed in digging and refining the precious metals, was provided. All these emi∣grants were to receive pay and subsistence for some years, at the public expence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iii. c. 1.</NOTE>.</P>

to so many of their countrymen. Columbus pro∣posed to transport to Hispaniola such malefactors as had been convicted of crimes, which, though capital, were of a less atrocious nature; and that for the future a certain proportion of the offenders usually sent to the gallies, should be condemned to labour in the mines which were to be opened. This advice, given without due reflection, was as inconsiderately adopted. The prisons of Spain were drained, in order to collect members for the intended colony; and the judges empowered to try criminals, were instructed to recruit it by their fu∣ture sentences. It is not, however, with such ma∣terials that the foundations of a society, destined to be permanent, should be laid. Industry, so∣briety, patience, and mutual confidence are indis∣pensably requisite in an infant settlement, where purity of morals must contribute more towards establishing order, than the operation or authority of laws. But when such a mixture of what is cor∣rupt is admitted into the original constitution of the political body, the vices of those unsound and incurable members will probably infect the whole, and must certainly be productive of violent and unhappy effects. This the Spaniards fatally expe∣rienced; and the other European nations having successively imitated the practice of Spain in this particular, pernicious consequences have followed in their settlements, which can be imputed to no other cause<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iii. c. 2.

any man, less accustomed to encounter and to sur∣mount difficulties. Those delays were occasioned partly by that tedious formality and spirit of pro∣crastination, with which the Spaniards conduct business; and partly by the exhausted state of the treasury, which was drained by the expence of celebrating the marriage of Ferdinand and Isa∣bella's only son with Margaret of Austria, and that of Joanna, their second daughter, with Philip archduke of Austria<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P.

The Spaniards, who had never ventured so far to the south, were afraid that the ships would take fire, and began to apprehend the reality of what the ancients had taught concerning the destructive qualities of that torrid region of the globe. They were relieved, in some measure, from their fears by a seasonable fall of rain. This, however, though so heavy and unintermitting that the men could hardly keep the deck, did not greatly mitigate the intenseness of the heat. The admiral, who with his usual vigilance had in person directed every operation from the beginning of the voyage, was so much exhausted by fatigue and want of sleep, that it brought on a violent fit of the gout, accom∣panied with a fever. All these circumstances con∣strained him to yield to the importunities of his crew, and to alter his course to the north-west, in order to reach some of the Caribbee islands, where he might resit, and be supplied with provisions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovers the conti∣nent of A∣merica.</NOTE></P>

It lies on the coast of Guiana, near the mouth of the Orinoco. This, though a river only of the third or fourth magni∣tude in the New World, far surpasses any of the streams in our hemisphere. It rolls towards the ocean such a vast body of water, and rushes into it with such impetuous force, that when it meets the tide, which on that coast rises to an uncommon height, their collision occasions a swell and agita∣tion of the waves no less surprising than formida∣ble. In this conflict, the irresistible torrent of the river so far prevails, that it freshens the ocean many leagues with its flood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gumilla Hist. de l'Orenoque, tom. i. p. 14.</NOTE>. Columbus, before he could perceive the danger, was entangled among those adverse currents and tempestuous waves, and it was with the utmost difficulty that he escaped through a narrow strait, which appeared so tre∣mendous, that he called it La Boca del Drago. As soon as the consternation which this occasioned, permitted him to reflect upon the nature of an ap∣pearance so extraordinary, he discerned in it a source of comfort and hope. He justly concluded, that such a vast body of water as this river con∣tained, could not be supplied by any island, but must flow through a country of immense extent, and of consequence that he was now arrived at that continent which it had long been the object of his wishes to discover. Full of this idea, he stood to the west along the coast of those provinces which are now known by the names of Paria and Cumana. He landed in several places, and had some intercourse with the people, who resembled those of Hispaniola in their appearance and manner of life. They wore, as ornaments, small plates of

gold, and pearls of considerable value, which they willingly exchanged for European toys. They seemed to possess a better understanding, and greater courage than the inhabitants of the islands.

As soon as the Spa∣niards were established in this new settlement, the adelantado, that they might neither languish in in∣activity, nor have leisure to form new cabals, marched into those parts of the island which his brother had not yet visited or reduced to obedi∣ence. As the people were unable to resist, they submitted every where to the tribute which he imposed. But they soon found the burden to be so intolerable, that, overawed as they were by the superior power of their oppressors, they took arms against them.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutiny of Roldan.</NOTE>BUT while the adelantado was employed against them in the field, a mutiny, of an aspect far more alarming, broke out among the Spaniards. The ringleader of it was Francis Roldan, whom Co∣lumbus had placed in a station which required him to be the guardian of order and tranquility in the colony. A turbulent and inconsiderate ambition precipitated him into this desperate measure, so unbecoming his rank. The arguments which he employed to seduce his countrymen were frivolous and ill-founded. He accused Columbus and his two brothers of arrogance and severity; he pre∣tended that they aimed at the establishing an inde∣pendent dominion in the country; he taxed them

with an intention of cutting off part of the Spaniards by hunger and fatigue, that they might more easily reduce the remainder to subjection; he represented it as unworthy of Castilians, to remain the tame and passive slaves of three Genoese adventurers. As men have always a propensity to impute the hardships of which they feel the pressure, to the misconduct of their rulers; as every nation views with a jealous eye the power and exaltation of fo∣reigners, Roldan's insinuations made a deep im∣pression on his countrymen. His character and rank added weight to them. A considerable num∣ber of the Spaniards made choice of him as their leader, and taking arms against the adelantado and his brother, seized the king's magazine of provisi∣ons, and endeavoured to surprise the fort at St. Domingo. This was preserved by the vigilance and courage of Don Diego Columbus. The mu∣tineers were obliged to retire to the province of Xaragua, where they continued not only to disclaim the adelantado's authority themselves, but excited the Indians to throw off the yoke<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iii. c. 5—8.

<P>SUCH was the distracted state of the colony when Columbus landed at St Domingo. He was asto∣nished to find that the three ships which he had dispatched from the Canaries were not yet arrived. By the unskilfulness of the pilots, and the violence of currents, they had been carried a hundred and sixty miles to the west of St. Domingo, and forced to take shelter in a harbour of the province of Xaragua, where Roldan and his seditious followers were cantoned. Roldan carefully concealed from the commanders of the ships his insurrection against the adelantado, and employing his utmost address to gain their confidence, persuaded them to set on

shore a considerable part of the new settlers whom they brought over, that they might proceed by land to St. Domingo. It required but few argu∣ments to prevail with those men to espouse his cause. They were the refuse of the jails of Spain, to whom idleness, licentiousness, and deeds of violence were familiar; and they returned eagerly to a course of life nearly resembling that to which they had been accustomed. The commanders of the ships perceiving, when it was too late, their imprudence in disembarking so many of their men, stood away for St. Domingo, and got safe into the port a few days after the admiral; but their stock of provisions was so wasted during a voyage of such long continuance, that they brought little relief to the colony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iii. c. 12.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Composed by the pru∣dent con∣duct of Co∣lumbus.</NOTE>BY this junction with a band of such bold and desperate associates, Roldan became extremely formidable, and no less extravagant in his de∣mands. Columbus, though filled with resentment at his ingratitude, and highly exasperated by the insolence of his followers, made no haste to take the field. He trembled at the thoughts of kin∣dling the flames of a civil war, in which, whatever party prevailed, the power and strength of both must be so much wasted, as might encourage the common enemy to unite and complete their destruc∣tion. At the same time, he observed, that the prejudices and passions which incited the rebels to take arms, had so far infected those who still ad∣hered to him, that many of them were adverse, and all cold to the service. From such sentiments, with respect to the public interest, as well as from this view of his own situation, he chose to nego∣ciate rather than to fight. By a seasonable procla∣mation, offering free pardon to such as should

By en∣gaging to grant such as should desire it the liberty of returning to Spain, he allured all those unfor∣tunate adventurers, who, from sickness and disap∣pointment, were disgusted with the country. By promising to re-establish Roldan in his former office, he soothed his pride; and, by complying with most of his demands in behalf of his fol∣lowers, he satisfied their avarice. Thus, gradually and without bloodshed, but after many tedious ne∣gociations, he disolved this dangerous combination which threatened the colony with ruin; and re∣stored the appearance of order, regular govern∣ment, and tranquillity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iii. c. 13, 14.

in that service. As soon as his affairs would permit, he sent some of his ships to Spain with a journal of the voyage which he had made, a description of the new countries which he had discovered, a chart of the coast along which he had sailed, and specimens of the gold, the pearls, and other curious or valuable productions which he had acquired by trafficking with the na∣tives.

Roldon and his associates did not neglect to convey to Spain, by the same ships, an apology for their own conduct together with their recri∣minations upon the admiral and his brothers.

<PB N="179" REF="034476_0177_0FFDD5722C527F20"/>
Self-condemnation and regret were not the only sentiments to which the success of Columbus, and reflection upon their own imprudence in rejecting his proposals, gave rise among the Portuguese. They excited a general emulation to surpass his performances, and an ardent desire to make some reparation to their country for their own error. With this view, Emanuel, who inherited the en∣terprising genius of his predecessors, persisted in their grand scheme of opening a passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope, and soon after his accession to the throne, equipped a squa∣dron for that important voyage. He gave the command of it to Vasco de Gama, a man of noble birth, possessed of virtue, prudence, and courage, equal to the station. The squadron, like all those fitted out for discovery in the infancy of naviga∣tion, was extremely feeble, consisting only of three vessels, of neither burden nor force adequate to the service. As the Europeans were at that time little acquainted with the course of the trade-winds and periodical monsoons, which render navigation in the Atlantic ocean, as well as in the sea that separates Africa from India, at some seasons easy, and at others not only dangerous, but almost impracticable, the time chosen for Gama's departure was the most improper during the whole year. He set sail from Lisbon on the ninth of July, and standing towards:<NOTE PLACE="marg">149<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> the south, had to struggle for four months with contrary winds, before he could reach the Cape of Good Hope.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> Here their violence began to abate; and during an interval of calm weather▪ Gama doubled that formidable promontory, which had so long been the boundary of navigation, and directed his course towards the north-east, along the African coast. He touched at several ports; and after various adventures, which the Portuguese Historians relate with high but just encomiums upon

his conduct and intrepidity, he came to anchor be∣fore the city of Melinda. Throughout all the vast countries which extend along the coast of Africa, from the river Senegal to the confines of Zan∣guebar, the Portuguese had found a race of men rude and uncultivated, strangers to letters, to arts, and commerce, and differing from the inhabitants of Europe, no less in their features and complexion, than in their manners and institutions. As they advanced from this, they observed, to their inex∣pressible joy, that the human form gradually al∣tered and improved; the Asiatic features began to predominate, marks of civilization appeared, letters were known, the Mahometan religion was esta∣blished, and a commerce, far from being inconsi∣derable, was carried on. At that time several ves∣sels from India were in the port of Melinda. Gama now pursued his voyage with almost absolute cer∣tainty of success, and under the conduct of a Ma∣hometan pilot, arrived at Calecut, upon the coast of Malabar, on the twenty-second of May one thou∣sand four hundred and ninety-eight. What he be∣held of the wealth, the populousness, the cultiva∣tion, the industry and arts of this highly civilized country, far surpassed any idea that he had formed, from the imperfect accounts which the Europeans had hitherto received of it. But as he possessed neither sufficient force to attempt a settlement, nor proper commodities with which he could carry on commerce of any consequence, he hastened back to Portugal, with account of his success in per∣forming a voyage, the longest, as well as most dif∣ficult, that had ever been made, since the first in∣vention of navigation. He landed at Lisbon on the fourteenth of September, on thousand four hundred and ninety-nine, two years two months and five days from the time he left that port<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ramusio, vol. i. 119, D.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="034476_0179_0FFDD576563C5260"/>THUS, during the course of the fifteenth cen∣tury, mankind made greater progress in exploring the state of the habitable globe, than in all the ages which had elapsed previous to that period. The spirit of discovery, feeble at first and cautious, moved within a very narrow sphere, and made its efforts with hesitation and timidity. Encouraged by success, it became adventurous, and boldly ex∣tended its operations. In the course of its progres∣sion, it continued to acquire vigour, and advanced at length with a rapidity and force which burst through all the limits within which ignorance and fear had hitherto circumscribed the activity of the human race, Almost fifty years were employed by the Portuguese in creeping along the coast of Africa from Cape Non to Cape de Verd, the latter of which lies only twelve degrees to the south of the former. In less than thirty years they ven∣tured beyond the equinoctial line into another hemisphere, and penetrated to the southern ex∣tremity of Africa, at the distance of forty-nine de∣grees from Cape de Verd. During the last seven years of the century, a New World was discovered in the west, not inferior in extent to all the parts of the earth with which mankind were at that time acquainted. In the east, unknown seas and coun∣tries were found out, and a communication, long desired, but hitherto concealed, was opened be∣tween Europe and the opulent regions of India. In comparison with events so wonderful and unex∣pected, all that had hitherto been deemed great or splendid, faded away and disappeared. Vast ob∣jects now presented themselves. The human mind, roused and interested by the prospect, engaged with ardour in pursuit of them, and exerted its active powers in a new direction.</P>
<P>THIS spirit of enterprise, though but newly awakened in Spain, began soon to operate exten∣sively.
<PB N="182" REF="034476_0180_0FFDD57A2EB54E50"/>

The Spanish court, whose scanty revenues were exhausted by the charge of its expeditions to the New World, which, though they opened alluring prospects of future benefit, yielded a very sparing return of present profit, was extremely willing to devolve the burden of discovery upon its subjects. It seized with joy an opportunity of rendering the avarice, the ingenuity, and efforts of projectors, instrumental in promoting designs of certain advantage to the public,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ojeda the first of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se.</NOTE> though of doubtful success with respect to themselves. One of the first propositions of this kind was made by Alonso de Ojeda, a gallant and active officer, who had accompanied Columbus in his second voyage. His rank and character pro∣cured him such credit with the merchants of Se∣ville, that they undertook to equip four ships, provided he could obtain the royal licence, autho∣rising the voyage. The powerful patronage of the bishop of Badajos easily secured success in a suit so agreeable to the court. Without consulting Co∣lumbus, or regarding the rights and jurisdiction which he had acquired by the capitulation in one thousand four hundred and ninety-two, Ojeda was permitted to set out for the New World. In order to direct his course, the bishop communicated to him the admiral's journal of his last voyage, and his charts of the countries which he had dis∣covered.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y.</NOTE> Ojeda struck out into no new path of navigation, but adhering servilely to the route

which Columbus had taken, arrived on the coast of Paria. He traded with the natives, and stand∣ing to the west, proceeded as far as Cape de Vela, and ranged along a considerable extent of coast beyond that on which Columbus had touched. Having thus ascertained the opinion of Columbus, that this country was a part of the continent, Ojeda returned by way of Hispaniola to Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">October.</NOTE> with some reputation as a discoverer, but with little benefit to those who had raised the funds for the expedition.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iv. c. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>AMERIGO VESPUCCI, a Florentine gentleman,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is accom∣panied by Amerigo Vespucci.</NOTE> accompanied Ojeda in this voyage. In what sta∣tion he served, is uncertain; but as he was an ex∣perienced sailor, and eminently skilful in all the sciences subservient to navigation, he seems to have acquired such authority among his companions, that they willingly allowed him to have a chief share in directing their operations during the voyage. Soon after his return, he transmitted an account of his adventures and discoveries to one of his countrymen; and labouring with the vanity of a traveller to magnify his own exploits, he had the address and confidence to frame his narrative, so as to make it appear that he had the glory of having first discovered the continent in the New World. Amerigo's account was drawn up not only with art, but with some elegance. It con∣tained an amusing history of his voyage, and ju∣dicious observations upon the natural productions, the inhabitants, and the customs of the countries which he had visited. As it was the first descrip∣tion of any part of the New World that was pub∣lished, a performance so well calculated to gratify the passion of mankind for what is new and mar∣vellous, circulated rapidly, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with ad∣miration.
<PB N="184" REF="034476_0182_0FFDD57E5F69BF80"/>
The country of which Amerigo was supposed to be the discoverer, came gradually to be called by his name. The caprice of mankind, often as unaccountable as unjust,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From whom the name of America is given to the New World.</NOTE> has perpetuated this error. By the universal consent of nations, AMERICA is the name bestowed on this new quar∣ter of the globe. The bold pretensions of a for∣tunate impostor have robbed the discoverer of the New World of a distinction which belonged to him.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Voyage of Alonso Nigno.</NOTE>DURING the same year, another voyage of dis∣covery was undertaken.

Alonso Nigno, who had served under the admiral in his last expedition, fitted out a single ship, in conjunction with Christopher Guerra, a mer∣chant of Seville, and sailed to the coast of Paria. This voyage seems to have been conducted with greater attention to private emolument, than to any general or national object.

In order to avoid the coast of Africa, where he was certain of meeting with variable breezes, or fre∣quent calms, which might retard his voyage, Cabral stood out to sea, and kept so far to the west, that, to his surprise, he found himself upon the shore of an unknown country, in the tenth degree be∣yond the line. He imagined, at first, that it was some island in the Atlantic ocean, hitherto unob∣served; but, proceeding along its coast for several days, he was led gradually to believe that a coun∣try so extensive formed a part of some great conti∣nent. This latter opinion was well founded. The country with which he fell in belongs to that pro∣vince in South America, now known by the name of Brasil. He landed; and having formed a very high idea of the fertility of the soil, and agreable∣ness of the climate, he took possession of it for the crown of Portugal, and dispatched a ship to Lisbon with an account of this event, which appeared to be no less important than it was unexpected<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iv. c. 7.</NOTE>.

discovery of the New World was the effort of an active genius, enlightened by science, guided by experience, and acting upon a regular plan, executed with no less courage than perseverance. But from this adventure of the Portuguese, it ap∣pears that chance might have accomplished that great design which is now the pride of human reason to have formed and perfected.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Machina∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>s against Columbus.</NOTE>WHILE the Spaniards and Portuguese, by those successive voyages, were daily acquiring more en∣larged ideas of the extent and opulence of that quarter of the globe which Columbus had made known to them, he himself, far from enjoying the tranquillity and honours with which his services should have been recompensed, was struggling with every distress in which the envy and malevolence of the people under his command, or the ingrati∣tude of the court which he served, could involve him. Though the pacification with Roldan broke the union and weakened the force of the mutineers, it did not extirpate the seeds of discord out of the island. Several of the malcontents continued in arms, refusing to submit to the admiral. He and his brothers were obliged to take the field alter∣nately, in order to check their incursions, or to punish their crimes. The perpetual occupation and disquiet which this created, prevented him from giving due attention to the dangerous machinations of his enemies in the court of Spain. A good number of such as were most dissatisfied with his administration, had embraced the opportunity of returning to Europe with the ships which he dis∣patched
<PB N="187" REF="034476_0185_0FFDD5874B141710"/>
from St. Domingo. The final disappoint∣ment of all their hopes enflamed the rage of these unfortunate adventurers against Columbus to the utmost pitch. Their poverty and distress, by ex∣citing compassion, rendered their accusations cre∣dible, and their complaints interesting. They teazed Ferdinand and Isabella incessantly with memorials, containing the detail of their own grievances, and the articles of their charge against Columbus. Whenever either the king or queen appeared in public, they surrounded them in a tumultuary manner, insisting with importunate clamours for the payment of the arrears due to them, and de∣manding vengeance upon the author of their suf∣ferings. They insulted the admiral's sons where∣ever they met them, approaching them as the offspring of the projector, whose fatal curiosity had discovered those pernicious regions which drained Spain of its wealth, and would prove the grave of its people. These avowed endeavours of the mal∣contents from America to ruin Columbus, were seconded by the secret, but more dangerous insinu∣ations of that party among the courtiers, which had always thwarted his schemes, and envied his success and credit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 85.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FERDINAND was disposed to listen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their in∣fluence on Ferdinand and Isabel∣la.</NOTE> not only with a willing, but with a partial ear, to these accusa∣tions. Notwithstanding the flattering accounts which Columbus had given of the riches of Ame∣rica, the remittances from it had hitherto been so scanty, that they fell far short of defraying the ex∣pence of the armaments fitted out. The glory of the discovery, together with the prospect of re¦mote commercial advantages, was all that Spain had yet received in return for the efforts which she had made. But time had already diminished the
<PB N="188" REF="034476_0186_0FFDD589E0481190"/>
first sensations of joy which the discovery of a New World occasioned, and fame alone was not an ob∣ject to satisfy the cold interested mind of Ferdinand. The nature of commerce was then so little under∣stood, that where immediate gain was not acquired, the hope of distant benefit, or of slow and moderate returns, was totally disregarded. Ferdinand consi∣dered Spain, on this account, as having lost by the enterprise of Columbus, and imputed it to his mis∣conduct and incapacity for government, that a country abounding in gold had yielded nothing of value to its conquerors. Even Isabella, who from the favourable opinion which she entertained of Columbus, had uniformly protected him, was sha∣ken at length by the number and boldness of his ac∣cusers, and began to suspect that a disaffection so general must have been occasioned by real grie∣vances, which called for redress. The bishop of Badajos, with his usual animosity against Columbus, encouraged these suspicions, and confirmed them.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Fatal ef∣fects of this.</NOTE>AS soon as the queen began to give way to the torrent of calumny, a resolution fatal to Columbus was taken. Francis de Bouvadilla, a knight of Ca∣latrava, was appointed to repair to Hispaniola, with full powers to enquire into the conduct of Colum∣bus, and, if he should find the charge of mal-admi∣nistration proved, to supersede him, and assume the government of the island. It was impossible to escape condemnation, when this preposterous com∣mission made it the interest of the judge to pro∣nounce the person whom he was sent to try, guilty. Though Columbus had now composed all the dis∣sensions in the island; though he had brought both Spaniards and Indians to submit peaceably to his government; though he had made such effectual provision for working the mines, and cultivating the country, as would have secured a considerable revenue to the king, as well as large profits to in∣dividuals,
<PB N="189" REF="034476_0187_0FFDD58CA1070C30"/>
Bovadilla, without deigning to attend to the nature or merit of those services, discovered, from the moment that he landed in Hispaniola, a determined purpose of treating him as a criminal. He took possession of the admiral's house in St. Domingo, from which its master happened at that time to be absent, and seized his effects, as if his guilt had been already fully proved; he rendered himself master of the sort and of the king's stores by violence; he required all persons to acknow∣ledge him as supreme governor; he set at liberty the prisoners confined by the admiral, and sum∣moned him to appear before his tribunal, in order to answer for his conduct; transmitting to him, to∣gether with the summons, a copy of the royal man∣date, by which Columbus was enjoined to yield im∣plicit obedience to his commands.</P>
<P>COLUMBUS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Columbus sent in chains to Spain. October.</NOTE> though deeply affected with the in∣gratitude and justice of Ferdinand and Isabella, did not hesitate a moment about his own conduct. He submitted to the will of his sovereigns with a respectful silence, and repaired directly to the court of that violent and partial judge whom they had authorized to try him. Bovadilla, without admitting him into his presence, ordered him in∣stantly to be arrested, to be loaded with chains, and hurried on board a ship. Even under this hu∣miliating reverse of fortune, the firmness of mind which distinguishes the character of Columbus, did not forsake him. Conscious of his own integrity, and solacing himself with reflecting upon the great things which he had atchieved, he endured this insult offered to his character, not only with com∣posure, but with dignity. Nor had he the consola∣tion of sympathy to mitigate his sufferings. Bova∣dilla had already rendered himself so extremely popular, by granting various immunities to the colony, by liberal donations of Indians to all who
<PB N="190" REF="034476_0188_0FFDD58E580B4600"/>
applied for them, and by relaxing the reins of dis∣cipline and government, that the Spaniards, who were mostly adventurers, whom their indigence or crimes had impelled to abandon their native country, expressed the most indecent satisfaction with the disgrace and imprisonment of Columbus. They flattered themselves, that now they should enjoy an uncontrouled liberty, more suitable to their disposition and former habits of life. Among persons thus prepared to censure the proceedings, and to asperse the character of Columbus, Bova∣dilla collected materials for a charge against him. All accusations, the most improbable, as well as inconsistent, were received. No informer, how∣ever infamous, was rejected. The result of this inquest, no less indecent than partial, he transmit∣ted to Spain. At the same time, he ordered Co∣lumbus, with his two brothers to be carried thi∣ther in fetters; and, adding cruelty to insult, he confined them in different ships, and excluded them from the comfort of that friendly intercourse which might have soothed their common distress. But while the Spaniards in Hispaniola viewed the arbitrary and insolent proceedings of Bovadilla with a general approbation, which reflects dis∣honour upon their name and country, one man still retained a proper sense of the great actions which Columbus had performed, and was touched with the sentiments of veneration and pity due to his rank, his age, and his merit. Alonso de Vallejo, the captain of the vessel on board which the ad∣miral was confined, as soon as he was clear of the island, approached his prisoner with great respect, and offered to release him from the fetters with which he was unjustly loaded. "No," replied Columbus with a generous indignation, "I wear these irons in consequence of an order from my sovereigns. They shall find me as obedient to this

<P>FORTUNATELY,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 23. Set at li∣berty, but deprived of all autho∣rity.</NOTE> the voyage to Spain was ex∣tremely short. As soon as Ferdinand and Isabella were informed that Columbus was brought home a prisoner, and in chains, they perceived at once what universal astonishment this event must occa∣sion, and what an impression to their disadvantage it must make. All Europe, they foresaw, would be filled with indignation at this ungenerous re∣quital of a man who had performed actions worthy of the highest recompence, and would exclaim against the injustice of the nation, to which he had been such an eminent benefactor, as well as against the ingratitude of the princes whose reign he had rendered illustrious. Ashamed of their own con∣duct, and eager not only to make some reparation for this injury, but to efface the stain which it might fix upon their character, they instantly issued orders to set Columbus at liberty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 17.</NOTE> invited him to court, and remitted money to enable him to appear there in a manner suitable to his rank. When he entered the royal presence, Columbus threw him∣self at the feet of his sovereigns. He remained for some time silent; the various passions which agitated his mind suppressing his power of utter∣ance. At length he recovered himself, and vin∣dicated his conduct in a long discourse, producing the most satisfying proofs of his own integrity, as well as good intention, and evidence, no less clear, of the malevolence of his enemies, who, not satisfied with having ruined his fortune, labour∣ed to deprive him of what alone was now left, his honour and his fame. Ferdinand received him
<PB N="192" REF="034476_0190_0FFDD59488AE1390"/>
with decent civility, and Isabella with tenderness and respect. They both expressed their sorrow for what had happened, disavowed their knowledge of it, and joined in promising him protection and future favour. But though they instantly degraded Bovadilla, in order to remove from themselves any suspicion of having authorised his violent proceed∣ings, they did not restore to Columbus his juris∣diction and privileges as viceroy of those countries which he had discovered. Though willing to ap∣pear the avengers of Columbus's wrongs, that illiberal jealousy which prompted them to invest Bovadilla with such authority as put it in his power to treat the admiral with indignity still sub∣sisted. They were afraid to trust a man to whom they had been so highly indebted, and retaining him at court under various pretexts, they appointed Nicholas de Ovando, a knight of the military or∣der of Alcantara, governor of Hispaniola<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iv. c. 10—12.

<P>COLUMBUS was deeply affected with this new injury, which came from hands that seemed to be employed in making reparations for his past suffer∣ings. The sensibility with which great minds feel every thing that implies any suspicion of their in∣tegrity, or that wears the aspect of an affront, is exquisite. Columbus had experienced both from the Spaniards; and their ungenerous conduct ex∣asperated him to such a degree, that he could no longer conceal the sentiments which it excited. Wherever he went, he carried about with him, as a memorial of their ingratitude, those fetters with which he had been loaded. They were constantly hung up in his chamber,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1501.

<P><PB N="193" REF="034476_0191_0FFDD5972B418C20"/>MEANWHILE, the spirit of discovery, notwith∣standing the severe check which it had received by the ungenerous treatment of the man, who first excited it in Spain, continued active and vigorous. Roderigo de Bastidas, a person of distinction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">January.</NOTE> fitted out two ships in co-partnery with John de la Cosa, who having served under the admiral in two of his voyages, was deemed the most skilful pilot in Spain. They steered directly towards the con∣tinent, arrived on the coast of Paria, and pro∣ceeding to the west, discovered all the coast of the province now known by the name of Tierra Firme, from Cape de Vela to the gulf of Darien. Not long after Ojeda, with his former ass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>iate Amerigo Vespucci, set out upon a second voyage, and being unacquainted with the destination of Ba∣stidas, held the same course, and touched at the same places. The voyage of Bastidas was pro∣sperous and lucrative, that of Ojeda unfortunate.

of those which Columbus deemed essential to the prosperity of the colony. Instead of the severe dis∣cipline, necessary in order to habituate the dissolute and corrupted members of which the society was composed, to the restraints of law and subordina∣tion, he suffered them to enjoy such uncontrouled licence, as encouraged the wildest excesses. In∣stead of protecting the Indians, he gave a legal sanction to the oppression of that unhappy people. He took the exact number of such as survived their past calamities, divided them into distinct classes, distributed them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> property among his ad∣herents, and reduced all the people of the island to a state of complete servitude.

charge, and was commanded to return instantly to Spain, in order to answer for his conduct. Roldan, and the other ringleaders of the mutineers, who had been most active in opposing Columbus, were required to leave the island at the same time. A proclamation was issued, declaring the natives to be free subjects of Spain, of whom no service was to be exacted contrary to their own inclination, and without paying them an adequate price for their labour. With respect to the Spaniards them∣selves, various regulations were made, tending to suppress the licentious spirit which had been so fatal to the colony, and to establish that reverence for law and order on which society is founded, and to which it is indebted for its increase and stability. In order to limit the exorbitant gain which private persons were supposed to make by working the mines, an ordinance was published, directing all the gold to be brought to a public smelting-house, and declaring one half of it to be the property of the crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Solorzano Politica Indiana, lib. i. c. 12.

<P>WHILE these steps were taking for securing the tranquillity and welfare of the colony which Co∣lumbus had planted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The disa∣greeable situation of Columbus.</NOTE> he himself was engaged in the unpleasant employment of soliciting the favour of an ungrateful court, and, notwithstanding all his merit and services, he solicited in vain. He de∣manded, in terms of the original capitulation in one thousand four hundred and ninety-two, to be reinstated in his office of viceroy over the countries which he had discovered. By a strange fatality, the circumstances which he urged in support of his claim, determined a jealous monarch to reject it. The g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ness of his discoveries, and the prospect of their increasing value, made Ferdinand consider
<PB N="196" REF="034476_0194_0FFDD59EF6B06978"/>
the concessions in the capitulation as extravagant and impolitic. He was afraid of entrusting a sub∣ject with the exercise of a jurisdiction that now ap∣peared to be so extremely extensive, and might grow to be no less formidable. He inspired Isa∣bella with the same suspicions; and under various pretexts equally frivolous and unjust, they eluded all Columbus's requisitions to perform that which a solemn compact bound them to accomplish. After attending the court of Spain for near two years, as an humble suitor, he found it impossible to remove Ferdinand's prejudices and apprehen∣sions; and perceived, at length, that he laboured in vain, when he urged a claim of justice or merit with an interested and unfeeling prince.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He forms new schemes of discovery.</NOTE>BUT even this ungenerous return did not discou∣rage him from pursuing the great object which first called forth his inventive genius, and excited him to attempt discovery. To open a new passage to the East Indies was his original and favourite scheme. This still engrossed his thoughts; and either from his own observations in his voyage to Paria, or from some obscure hint of the natives, or from the accounts given by Bastidas and de la Cosa, of their expedition, he conceived an opinion that, beyond the continent of America, there was a sea which extended to the East-Indies, and hoped to find some strait or narrow neck of land, by which a communication might be opened with it and the part of the ocean already known. By a very fortunate conjecture, he supposed this strait or isthmus to be situated near the gulph of Darien. Full of this idea, though he was now of an ad∣vanced age, worn out with fatigue, and broken with infirmities, he offered, with the alacrity of a youthful adventurer, to undertake a voyage which would ascertain this important point, and perfect the grand scheme which from the beginning he
<PB N="197" REF="034476_0195_0FFDD5A090A4B630"/>
proposed to accomplish. Several circumstances concurred in disposing Ferdinand and Isabella to lend a favourable ear to this proposal. They were glad to have the pretext of any honourable em∣ployment for removing from court a man with whose demands they deemed it impolitic to com∣ply, and whose services it was indecent to neglect. Though unwilling to reward Columbus, they were not insensible of his merit, and from their expe∣rience of his skill and conduct, had reason to give credit to his conjectures, and to confide in his suc∣cess. To these considerations, a third must be added of still more powerful influence. About this time the Portuguese fleet, under Cabral, arrived from the Indies; and, by the richness of its cargo, gave the people of Europe a more perfect idea than they had hitherto been able to form, of the opulence and fertility of the east. The Portuguese had been more fortunate in their discoveries than the Spa∣niards. They had opened a communication with countries where industry, arts, and elegance flou∣rished; and where commerce had been longer esta∣blished, and carried to greater extent, than in any region of the earth. Their first voyages thither yielded immediate as well as vast returns of profit, in commodities extremely precious and in great request. Lisbon became immediately the seat of commerce and wealth; while Spain had only the expectation of remote benefit, and of future gain, from the western world. Nothing, then, could be more acceptable to the Spaniards than Columbus's offer to conduct them to the east, by a route which he expected to be shorter, as well as less danger∣ous, than that which the Portuguese had taken. Even Ferdinand was roused by such a prospect, and warmly approved of the undertaking.</P>
<P>BUT interesting as the object of this voyage was to the nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His fourth voyage.</NOTE> Columbus could procure only four
<PB N="198" REF="034476_0196_0FFDD5A436E34CD0"/>
small barks, the largest of which did not exceed seventy tons in burden, for performing it. Ac∣customed to brave danger, and to engage in arduous undertakings with inadequate force, he did not he∣sitate to accept the command of this pitiful squa∣dron. His brother Bartholomew, and his second son Ferdinand, the historian of his actions, accom∣panied him. He sailed from Cadiz on the ninth of May, and touched, as usual, at the Canary islands; from thence he proposed to have stood directly for the continent; but his largest vessel was so clumsy and unfit for service, as constrained him to bear away for Hispaniola, in hopes of exchanging her for some ship of the fleet that had carried out Ovando.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29.</NOTE> When he arrived at St. Domingo, he found eighteen of these ships ready loaded, and on the point of departing for Spain. Columbus im∣mediately acquainted the governor with the desti∣nation of his voyage, and the accident which had obliged him to alter his route. He requested per∣mission to enter the harbour, not only that he might negociate the exchange of his ship, but that he might take shelter during a violent hur∣ricane, of which he discerned the approach from various prognostics, which his experience and sa∣gacity had taught him to observe. On that ac∣count, he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>evised him likewise to put off for some days the departure of the fleet bound for Spain. But Ovando refused his request, and despised his counsel. Under circumstances in which humanity would have afforded refuge to a stranger, Colum∣bus was denied admittance into a country of which he had discovered the existence and acquired the possession. His salutary warning, which merited the greatest attention, was regarded as the dream of a visionary prophet, who arrogantly pretended to predict an event beyond the reach of human foresight. The fleet set sail for Spain. Next
<PB N="199" REF="034476_0197_0FFDD5A6CF208348"/>
night the hurricane came on with dreadful im∣petuosity. Columbus, aware of the danger, took precautions against it, and saved his little squadron. The fleet destined for Spain met with the fate which the rashness and obstinacy of its commanders deserved. Of eighteen ships, two or three only escaped. In this general wreck pe∣rished Bovadilla, Roldan, and the greater part of those who had been the most active in persecuting Columbus and oppressing the Indians. Together with themselves, all the wealth which they had acquired by their injustice and cruelty was swal∣lowed up. It exceeded in value two hundred thousand <HI>pesos;</HI> an immense sum at that period, and sufficient not only to have screened them from any severe scrutiny into their conduct, but to have secured them a gracious reception in the Spanish court. Among the ships that escaped, one had on board all the effects of Columbus, which had been recovered from the ruins of his fortune. Histo∣rians, struck with the exact discrimination of cha∣racters, as well as the just distribution of rewards and punishments, conspicuous in those events, uni∣versally attribute them to an immediate interpo∣sition of divine Providence, in order to avenge the wrongs of an injured man, and to punish the op∣pressors of an innocent people. Upon the igno∣rant and superstitious race of men, who were wit∣nesses of this occurrence, it made a different im∣pression. From an opinion which vulgar admi∣ration is apt to entertain with respect to persons who have distinguished themselves by their sagacity and inventions, they believed Columbus to be pos∣sessed of supernatural powers, and imagined that he had conjured up this dreadful storm by magical art and incantations, in order to be avenged of his enemies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oviedo, lib. iii. c. 7.9.

<P><PB N="200" REF="034476_0198_0FFDD72540A29CE8"/>COLUMBUS soon left Hispaniola, where he met with such an inhospitable reception, and stood to∣wards the continent. After a tedious and dan∣gerous voyage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 14. Searches in vain for a passage to the Indian ocean.</NOTE> he discovered Guanaia, an island not far distant from the coast of Honduras. There he had an interview with some inhabitants of the continent, who arrived in a large canoe. They appeared to be a people more civilized, and who had made greater progress in the knowledge of useful arts, than any whom he had hitherto dis∣covered. In return to the inquiries which the Spaniards made, with their usual eagerness, con∣cerning the places where the Indians got the gold which they wore by way of ornament, they di∣rected them to countries situated to the west, in which gold was found in such profusion, that it was applied to the most common uses. Instead of steering in quest of a country so inviting, which would have conducted him along the coast of Yu∣catan to the rich empire of Mexico, Columbus was so bent upon his favourite scheme of finding out the strait which he supposed to communicate with the Indian ocean, that he bore away to the east towards the gulph of Darien. In this naviga∣tion he discovered all the coast of the continent, from Cape Gracias a Dios, to a harbour which, on account of its beauty and security, he called Porto Bello. He searched, in vain, for the ima∣ginary strait through which he expected to make his way into an unknown sea; and though he went on shore several times, and advanced into the country, he did not penetrate so far as to cross the narrow isthmus which separates the gulf of Mexico from the great southern ocean. He was so much delighted, however, with the fertility of the coun∣try, and conceived such an idea of its wealth, from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e specimens of gold produced by the natives, that he resolved to leave a small colony upon the

<P>THIS repulse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shipwreck∣ed on the coast of Ja∣maica.</NOTE> the first that the Spaniards met with from any of the American nations, was not the only misfortune that befel Columbus; it was followed by a succession of all the disasters to which navigation is exposed.

One of his ships perished; he was obliged to abandon another, as unfit for service; and with the two which remained, he quitted that part of the continent which in his an∣guish he named the Coast of Vexation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">La Costa de los Contrastes.</NOTE>, and bore away for Hispaniola. New distresses awaited him in this voyage. He was driven back by a violent tempest from the coast of Cuba, his ships fell foul of one another, and were so much shattered by the shock, that with the utmost difficulty they reached Jamaica,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 24.</NOTE> where he was obliged to run them aground, to prevent them from sinking▪ The
<PB N="202" REF="034476_0200_0FFDD62D1125E480"/>
measure of his calamities seemed now to be full. He was cast ashore upon an island at a considerable distance from the only settlement of the Spaniards in America. His ships were ruined beyond the possibility of being repaired. To convey an ac∣count of his situation to Hispaniola, appeared im∣practicable; and without this it was vain to expect relief. His genius, fertile in resources, and most vigorous in those perilous extremities when feeble minds abandon themselves to despair, discovered the only expedient which afforded any prospect of deliverance. He had recourse to the hospitable kindness of the natives, who considering the Spa∣niards as beings of a superior nature, were eager, on every occasion, to minister to their wants. From them he obtained two of their canoes, each formed out of the trunk of a single tree hollowed with fire, and so mis-shapen and aukward as hardly to merit the name of boats. In these, which were fit only for creeping along the coast, or crossing from one side of a bay to another, Mendez, a Spaniard, and Fieschi, a Genoese, two gentlemen particularly at∣tached to Columbus, gallantly offered to set out for Hispaniola, upon a voyage of above thirty leagues<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oviedo, lib. iii. c. 9.</NOTE>. This they accomplished in ten days, after surmounting incredible dangers, and enduring such fatigues, that several of the Indians who ac∣companied them sunk under it, and died. The attention paid to them by the governor of Hispa∣niola was neither such as their courage merited, nor the distress of the persons from whom they came required. Ovando, from a mean jealousy of Columbus, was afraid of allowing him to set foot in the island under his government. This ungene∣rous passion hardened his heart against every tender sentiment, which reflection upon the services and
<PB N="203" REF="034476_0201_0FFDD630B5140340"/>
misfortunes of that great man, or compassion for his own fellow-citizens involved in the same cala∣mities, must have excited. Mendez and Fieschi spent eight months in soliciting relief for their commander and associates, without any prospect of obtaining it.</P>
<P>DURING this period,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His distress and suffer∣ings there.</NOTE> various passions agitated the mind or Columbus, and his companions in ad∣versity. At first the expectation of speedy deliver∣ance, from the success of Mendez and Fieschi's voyage, cheered the spirits of the most desponding▪ After some time the more timorous began to suspect that they had miscarried in their daring at∣tempt. At length, even the most sanguine con∣cluded that they had perished.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1504.</NOTE> The ray of hope which had broke in upon them, made their condi∣tion appear now more dismal. Despair, heightened by disappointment, settled in every breast. Their last resource had failed, and nothing remained but the prospect of ending their miserable days among naked savages, far from their country and their friends. The seamen, in a transport of rage, rose in open mutiny, threatened the life of Columbus, whom they reproached as the author of all their calamities, seized ten canoes, which he had pur∣chased from the Indians, and despising his remon∣strances and entreaties, made off with them to a distant part of the island. At the same time the natives murmured at the long residence of the Spa∣niards in their country. As their industry was not greater than that of their neighbours in Hispaniola, like them they found the burden of supporting so many strangers to be altogether intolerable. They began to bring in provisions with reluctance, they furnished them with a sparing hand, and threatened to withdraw those supplies altogether. Such a re∣solution must have been quickly fatal to the Spa∣niards. Their safety depended upon the good∣will
<PB N="204" REF="034476_0202_0FFDD633885EFD78"/>
of the Indians; and unless they could revive the admiration and reverence with which that sim∣ple people had at first beheld them, destruction was unavoidable. Though the licentious proceedings of the mutineers had, in a great measure, ef∣faced those impressions which had been so fa∣vourable to the Spaniards, the ingenuity of Co∣lumbus suggested a happy artifice, that not only restored but heightened the high opinion which the Indians had originally entertained of them. By his skill in astronomy he knew that there was shortly to be a total eclipse of the moon. He assembled all the principal persons of the district around him on the day before it happened, and, after reproaching them for their sickleness in with∣drawing their affection and assistance from men whom they had lately revered, he told them, that the Spaniards were servants of the Great Spirit who dwells in heaven, who made and governs the world; that he, offended at their refusing to support men who were the objects of his peculiar favour, was preparing to punish this crime with exemplary severity, and that very night the moon should withhold her light, and appear of a bloody hue, as a sign of the divine wrath, and an emblem of the vengeance ready to fall upon them. To this mar∣vellous prediction some of them listened with the careless indifference peculiar to the people of Ame∣rica; others, with the credulous astonishment na∣tural to barbarians. But when the moon began gradually to be darkened, and at length appeared of a red colour, all were struck with terror. They ran with consternation to their houses, and return∣ing instantly to Columbus loaded with provisions, threw them at his feet, conjuring him to intercede with the Great Spirit to avert the destruction with which they were threatened. Columbus, seeming to be moved by their entreaties, promised to com∣ply
<PB N="205" REF="034476_0203_0FFDD636446D4918"/>
with their desire. The eclipse went off, the moon recovered its splendour, and from that day the Spaniards were not only furnished profusely with provisions, but the natives, with superstitious attention, avoided every thing that could give them offence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 103.

But, from their own misconduct, or the violence of the winds and currents, their efforts were all unsuccessful. Enraged at this disappointment, they marched to∣wards that part of the island where Columbus re∣mained, threatening him with new insults and dan∣ger. While they were advancing, an event hap∣pened, more cruel and afflicting than any calamity which he dreaded from them. The governor of Hispaniola, whose mind was still filled with some dark suspicions of Columbus, sent a small bark to Jamaica, not to deliver his distressed countrymen, but to spy out their condition. Lest the sympathy of those whom he employed should afford them re∣lief, contrary to his intention, he gave the com∣mand of this vessel to Escobar, an inveterate ene∣my of Columbus, who adhering to his instructions with malignant accuracy, cast anchor at some distance from the island, approached the shore in a small boat, observed the wretched plight of the Spaniards, delivered a letter of empty compliments to the admiral, received his answer, and departed. When the Spaniards first descried the vessel stand∣ing towards the island, every heart exulted, as if the long-expected hour of their deliverance had at length arrived; but when it disappeared so sud∣denly, they sunk into the deepest dejection, and
<PB N="206" REF="034476_0204_0FFDD637EF56D1F8"/>
all their hopes died away. Columbus alone, though he felt most sensibly this wanton insult which Ovando added to his past neglect, retained such composure of mind, as to be able to cheer his followers. He assured them, that Mendez and Fieschi had reached Hispaniola in safety; that they would speedily pro∣cure ships to carry them off; but as Escobar's vessel could not take them all on board, that he had refused to go with her, because he was deter∣mined never to abandon the faithful companions of his distress. Soothed with the expectation of speedy deliverance, and delighted with his apparent gene∣rosity in attending more to their preservation than to his own safety, their spirits revived, and he re∣gained their confidence.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 104.

<P>WITHOUT this confidence, he could not have resisted the mutineers, who were now at hand. All his endeavours to reclaim these desperate men had no effect but to increase their frenzy. Their de∣mands became every day more extravagant, and their intentions more violent and bloody. The common safety rendered it necessary to oppose them with open force. Columbus, who had been long afflicted with the gout, could not take the field.<NOTE PLACE="marg">May 20.</NOTE> His brother, the adelantado, marched against them. They quickly met. The mutineers rejected with scorn terms of accommodation, which were once more offered them, and rushed on boldly to the attack. They fell not upon an enemy unpre∣pared to receive them.

The ade∣lantado, whose strength was equal to his courage, closed with their captain, wounded, disarmed, and took him prisoner<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 107.

Soon after, they submitted in a body to Columbus, and bound themselves by the most so∣lemn oaths to obey all his commands. Hardly was tranquillity re-established, when the ships appeared, whose arrival Columbus had promised with great ad∣dress, though he could foresee it with little certainty.

But amidst those over-acted demonstrations of regard, he could not conceal the hatred and malignity la∣tent in his heart. He set at liberty the captain of the mutineers, whom Columbus had brought over in chains, to be tried for his crimes, and threatened such as had adhered to the admiral, with proceeding to a judicial enquiry into their conduct.

None now remained to redress his wrongs, or to reward him for his services and sufferings, but Ferdinand, who had so long opposed and so often injured him. To solicit a prince thus prejudiced against him, was an occupation no less irksome than hopeless. In this, however, Columbus was doomed to employ the close of his days. As soon as his health was in some degree re-established, he re∣paired to court; and though he was received there with civility barely decent, he plied Ferdinand with petition after petition, demanding the punishment of his oppressors, and the restitution of all the pri∣vileges bestowed upon him by the capitulation of one thousand four hundred and ninety-two.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK III. 1504. State of the colony in Hispaniola.</NOTE>WHILE Columbus was employed in his last voyage, several events worthy of notice happened in Hispaniola. The colony there, the parent and nurse of all the subsequent establishments of Spain in the New World, gradually acquired the form of a regular and prosperous society. The humane solicitude of Isabella to protect the Indians from oppression, and particularly the proclamation, by which the Spaniards were prohibited to compel them to work, retarded, it is true, for some time, the progress of improvement. The natives, who considered exemption from toil as supreme felicity, scorned every allurement and reward by which they were invited to labour. The Spaniards had not a sufficient number of hands either to work the mines or to cultivate the soil. Several of the first colonists, who had been accustomed to the service of the Indians, quitted the island, when deprived of those instruments, without which they knew not how to carry on any operation. Many of the new settlers who came over with Ovando, were seized with the distempers peculiar to the climate, and in a short space above a thousand of them died. At

the same time, the exacting one half of the product of the mines as the royal share, was found to be a demand so exorbitant, that no adventurers would engage to work them upon such terms. In order to save the colony from ruin, Ovando ventured to relax the rigour of the royal edicts.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1505.</NOTE> He made a new distribution of the Indians among the Spaniards, and compelled them to labour, for a stated time, in digging the mines, or in cultivating the ground; but, in order to screen himself from the imputation of having subjected them again to servitude, he en∣joined their masters to pay them a certain sum, as the price of their work. He reduced the royal share of the gold found in the mines from the half to the third part, and soon after lowered it to a fifth, at which it long remained. Notwithstanding Isa∣bella's tender concern for the good treatment of the Indians, and Ferdinand's eagerness to improve the royal revenue, Ovando persuaded the court to approve of both these regulations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. v. c. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT the Indians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">War with the Indians.</NOTE> after enjoying respite from oppression, though during a short interval, now felt the yoke of bondage to be so galling, that they made several attempts to vindicate their own li∣berty. This the Spaniards considered as rebellion, and took arms in order to reduce them to subjec∣tion. When war is carried on between nations whose state of improvement is in any degree simi∣lar, the means of defence bear some proportion to those employed in the attack; and in this equal contest such efforts must be made, such talents are displayed, and such passions roused, as exhibit mankind to view in a situation no less striking than interesting. It is one of the noblest functions of history, to observe and to delineate men at a junc∣ture when their minds are most violently agitated,
<PB N="212" REF="034476_0210_0FFDD648AE8CD6F0"/>
and all their powers and passions are called forth. Hence the operations of war, and the struggles between contending states, have been deemed by historians, ancient as well as modern, a capital and important article in the annals of human actions. But in a contest between naked savages, and one of the most warlike of the European nations, where science, courage, and discipline on one side, were op∣posed by ignorance, timidity, and disorder on the other, a particular detail of events would be as un∣pleasant as uninstructive. If the simplicity and inno∣cence of the Indians had inspired the Spaniards with humanity, had softened the pride of superiority into compassion, and had induced them to improve the inhabitants of the New World, instead of oppres∣sing them, some sudden acts of violence, like the too rigorous chastisements of impatient instructors, might have been related without horror. But, un∣fortunately, this consciousness of superiority ope∣rated in a different manner. The Spaniards were advanced so far beyond the natives of America in improvement of every kind, that they viewed them with contempt. They conceived the Americans to be animals of an inferior nature, who were not in∣titled to the rights and privileges of men. In peace, they subjected them to servitude. In war, they paid no regard to those laws, which, by a tacit convention between contending nations, regulate hostility, and set some bounds to its rage. They considered them not as men fighting in defence of their liberty, but as slaves, who had revolted against their masters. Their caziques, when taken, were condemned, like the leaders of banditti, to the most cruel and ignominious punishments; and all their subjects, without regarding the distinction of ranks established among them, were reduced to the same state of abject slavery. With such a spirit and sentiments were hostilities carried on against

the cazique of Higuey, a province at the eastern extremity of the island. This war was occasioned by the perfidy of the Spaniards, in violating a treaty which they had made with the natives, and it was terminated by hanging up the cazique, who defended his people with bravery so far superior to that of his countrymen, as intitled him to a better fate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vi. c. 9, 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE conduct of Ovando,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The cruel and trea∣cherous conduct of Ovando.</NOTE> in another part of the island, was still more treacherous and cruel. The province anciently named Xaragua, which extends from the fertile plain where Leogane is now situated, to the western extremity of the island, was subject to a female cazique, named Anacoana, highly re∣spected by the natives. She, from that partial fondness with which the women of America were attached to the Europeans, (the cause of which shall be afterwards explained,) had always courted the friendship of the Spaniards, and loaded them with benefits. But some of the adherents of Rol∣dan having settled in her country, were so much exasperated at her endeavouring to restrain their excesses, that they accused her of having formed a plan to throw off the yoke, and to exterminate the Spaniards. Ovando, though he knew well what little credit was due to such profligate men, marched, without further inquiry, towards Xara∣gua, with three hundred foot and seventy horse∣men. To prevent the Indians from taking alarm at this hostile appearance, he gave out that his sole intention was to visit Anacoana, to whom his countrymen had been so much indebted, in the most respectful manner, and to regulate with her the mode of levying the tribute payable to the king of Spain. Anacoana, in order to receive this
<PB N="214" REF="034476_0212_0FFDD64E021F2AC8"/>
illustrious guest with due honour, assembled the principal men in her dominions, to the number of three hundred, and advancing at the head of these, accompanied by a great croud of persons of infe∣rior rank, she welcomed Ovando with songs and dances, according to the mode of the country, and conducted him to the place of her residence. There he was feasted for some days, with all the kindness of simple hospitality, and amused with the games and spectacles usual among the Americans upon occasions of mirth and festivity. But, amidst the security which this inspired, Ovando was me∣ditating the destruction of his unsuspicious enter∣tainer and her subjects; and the mean perfidy with which he executed this scheme, equalled his bar∣barity in forming it. Under colour of exhibiting to the Indians the parade of an European tourna∣ment, he advanced with his troops, in battle array, towards the house in which Anacoana and the chiefs who attended her were assembled. The infantry took possession of all the avenues which led to the village. The horsemen encompassed the house. These movements were the object of admiration without any mixture of fear, until, upon a signal which had been concerted, the Spaniards suddenly drew their swords, and rushed upon the Indians, defenceless, and astonished at an act of treachery which exceeded the conception of undesigning men. In a moment Anacoana was secured. All her attendants were seized and bound. Fire was set to the house; and, without examination or con∣viction, all these unhappy persons, the most illus∣trious in their own country, were consumed in the flames. Anacoana was reserved for a more igno∣minious fate. She was carried in chains to St. Domingo, and, after the formality of a trial before Spanish judges, she was condemned, upon the

Upon the death of Isabella, all the regulations tending to mitigate the rigour of their servitude were forgotten. The small gratuity paid to them as the price of their labour was withdrawn; and at the same time the tasks imposed upon them were increased. Ovando,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1506.</NOTE> without any restraint, distributed Indians among his friends in the island. Ferdinand, to whom the queen had left by will one half of the revenue arising from the settlements in the New World, conferred grants of a similar nature upon his cour∣tiers as the least expensive mode of rewarding their services. They farmed out the Indians, of whom they were rendered proprietors, to their countrymen settled in Hispaniola; and that wretch∣ed people, being compelled to labour in order to satisfy the rapacity of both, the exactions of their oppressors no longer knew any bounds. But, bar∣barous as their policy was, and fatal to the inha∣bitants of Hispaniola, it produced for some time, very considerable effects. By calling forth the force of a whole nation, and exerting it in one direction, the working of the mines was carried on with amazing rapidity and success. During several years, the gold brought into the royal smelting-houses in Hispaniola amounted annually to four hundred and sixty thousand pesos, above a hundred thousand pounds sterling; which, if we

attend to the great change in the value of money since the beginning of the sixteenth century to the present times, must appear a considerable sum. Vast fortunes were created, of a sudden, by some. Others dissipated in ostentatious profusion, what they acquired with facility. Dazzled by both, new adventurers crowded to America, with the most eager impatience, to share in those treasures which had enriched their countrymen; and notwithstand∣ing the mortality occasioned by the unhealthiness of the climate, the colony continued to increase.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vi. c. 18, &amp;c.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Progress of the colony.</NOTE>OVANDO governed the Spaniards with wisdom and justice, not inferior to the rigour with which he treated the Indians. He established equal laws, and, by executing them with impartiality, ac∣customed the people of the colony to reverence them. He founded several new towns in different parts of the island, and allured inhabitants to them, by the concession of various immunities. He en∣deavoured to turn the attention of the Spaniards to some branch of industry more useful than that of searching for gold in the mines. Some slips of the sugar-cane having been brought from the Canary islands by way of experiment, they were found to thrive with such increase in the rich soil and warm climate to which they were transplanted, that the cultivation of them soon became an object of com∣merce. Extensive plantations were begun; sugar∣works, which the Spaniards called <HI>ingenio's,</HI> from the various machinery employed in them, were erected, and in a few years the manufacture of this commodity was the great occupation of the inhabi∣tants of Hispaniola and the most considerable source of their wealth.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Oviedo, lib. iv. c. 8.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE prudent endeavours of Ovando, to promote

the welfare of the colony, were powerfully seconded by Ferdinand. The large remittances which he re∣ceived from the New World opened his eyes, at length,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Political regulations of Ferdi∣nand.</NOTE> with respect to the importance of those dis∣coveries, which he had hitherto affected to under∣value. Fortune, and his own address, having now extricated him out of those difficulties in which he had been involved by the death of his queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1507.</NOTE> and by his disputes with his son-in-law about the govern∣ment of her dominions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. of the Reign of Charles V. vol. ii. p. 6, &amp;c.</NOTE>, he had full leisure to turn his attention to the affairs of America. To his provident sagacity, Spain is indebted for many of those regulations which gradually formed that system of profound, but jealous policy by which she governs her dominions in the New World. He erected a court, distinguished by the title of the <HI>Casa de Contratacion,</HI> or Board of Trade, composed of persons eminent for rank and abilities, to whom he committed the administration of American affairs. This board assembled regularly in Seville, and was invested with a distinct and extensive jurisdiction. He gave a regular form to ecclesiastical govern∣ment in America, by nominating archbishops, bi∣shops, deans, together with clergymen of subor∣dinate ranks, to take charge of the Spaniards es∣tablished there, as well as of the natives who should embrace the Christian faith. But, notwith∣standing the obsequious devotion of the Spanish court to the Papal See, such was Ferdinand's soli∣citude to prevent any foreign power from claiming jurisdiction, or acquiring influence, in his new do∣minions, that he reserved to the crown of Spain the sole right of patronage to the benefices in America, and stipulated that no papal bull or mandate should be promulgated there, until it was previously exa∣mined and approved of by his council. With
<PB N="218" REF="034476_0216_0FFDD6575DC0E5C8"/>
the same spirit of jealousy, he prohibited any goods to be exported to America, or any person to settle there, without a special licence from that council<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vi. c. 19, 20.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The num∣ber of the Indians di∣minishes fast.</NOTE>BUT, notwithstanding this attention to the police and welfare of the colony, a calamity impended which threatened its dissolution. The original in∣habitants, on whose labour the Spaniards in Hispa∣niola depended for their prosperity, and even their existence, wasted so fast, that the extinction of the whole race seemed to be inevitable. When Colum∣bus discovered Hispaniola, the number of its in∣habitants was computed to be at least a million<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. dec. lib. x. c. 12.</NOTE>. They were now reduced to sixty thousand in the space of fifteen years. This consumption of the human species, no less amazing than rapid, was the effect of several concurring causes. The natives of the American islands were of a more feeble consti∣tution than the inhabitants of the other hemisphere. They could neither perform the same work, nor endure the same fatigue, with men whose organs were of a more vigorous conformation. The list∣less indolence in which they delighted to pass their days, as it was the effect of their debility, contri∣buted likewise to increase it, and render them, from habit as well as constitution, incapable of hard la∣bour. The food on which they subsisted afforded little nourishment, and they were accustomed to take it in small quantities, not sufficient to invigo∣rate a languid frame, and render it equal to the efforts of active industry. The Spaniards, without attending to those peculiarities in the constitution of the Americans, imposed tasks upon them, which, though not greater than Europeans might have per∣formed with case, were so disproportioned to their
<PB N="219" REF="034476_0217_0FFDD65B0084D000"/>
strength, that many sunk under the fatigue, and ended their wretched days. Others, prompted by impatience and despair, cut short their own lives with a violent hand. Famine, brought on by compelling such numbers to abandon the culture of their lands, in order to labour in the mines, proved fatal to many. Diseases of various kinds, some occasioned by the hardships to which they were exposed, and others by their intercourse with the Europeans, who communicated to them some of their peculiar maladies, completed the desolation of the island. The Spaniards being thus deprived of the instruments which they were accustomed to employ, found it impossible to extend their im∣provements, or even to carry on the works which they had already begun.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1508.</NOTE> In order to provide an immediate remedy for an evil so alarming, Ovando proposed to transport the inhabitants of the Lucayo islands to Hispaniola, under the pretence that they might be civilized with more facility, and in∣structed to greater advantage in the Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an re∣ligion, if they were united to the Spanish colony, and placed under the immediate inspection of the missionaries settled there. Ferdinand, deceived by this artifice, or willing to connive at an act of violence which policy represented as necessary, gave his assent to the proposal. Several vessels were fitted out for the Lucayos, the commanders of which informed the natives, with whose language they were now well acquainted, that they came from a delicious country, in which the departed ancestors of the Indians resided, by whom they were sent to invite their descendants to resort thither, to partake of the bliss enjoyed there by happy spirits. That simple people listened with wonder and cre∣dulity; and, fond of visiting their relations and friends in that happy region, followed the Spani∣ards with eagerness. By this artifice, above forty

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New disco∣veries and settlements</NOTE>THE Spaniards had, for some time, carried on their operations in the mines of Hispaniola with such ardour as well as success, that these seemed to have engrossed their whole attention. The spirit of discovery lanquished; and, since the last voyage of Columbus, no enterprise of any moment had been undertaken. But as the decrease of the In∣dians rendered it impossible to acquire wealth in that island with the same rapidity as formerly, this urged some of the more adventurous Spaniards to search for new countries, where their avarice might be gratified with more facility. Juan Ponce de Leon, who commanded under Ovando in the east∣ern district of Hispaniola, passed over to the island of St. Juan de Puerto Rico, which Columbus had discovered in his second voyage, and penetrated into the interior part of the country. As he found the soil to be fertile, and expected, from some symptoms, as well as from the information of the inhabitants, to discover mines of gold in the moun∣tains, Ovando permitted him to attempt making a settlement in the island. This was easily effected by an officer eminent for conduct no less than for courage. In a few years Puerto Rico was sub∣jected to the Spanish government, the natives were reduced to servitude; and, being treated with the same inconsiderate rigour as their neighbours in Hispaniola, the race of original inhabitants, worn out with fatigue and sufferings, was soon extermi∣nated.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 1—4.

<P><PB N="221" REF="034476_0219_0FFDD66039669480"/>ABOUT the same time, Juan Diaz de Solis, in conjunction with vincent Yanez Pinzon, one of Columbus's original companions, made a voyage to the continent. They held the same course which Columbus had taken, as far as to the island of Gua∣naios; but, standing from thence to the west, they discovered a new and extensive province, after∣wards known by the name of Yucatan, and pro∣ceeded a considerable way along the coast of that country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vi. c. 17.</NOTE>. Though nothing memorable occurred in this voyage, it deserves notice, because it led to discoveries of greater importance. For the same reason, the voyage of Sebastian de Ocampo, must be mentioned. By the command of Ovando, he sailed round Cuba, and first discovered with cer∣tainty, that this country, which Columbus once supposed to be a part of the continent, was a large island<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS voyage round Cuba was one of the last occurrences under the administration of Ovando.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diego Co∣lumbus ap∣pointed go∣vernor of Hispaniola.</NOTE> Ever since the death of Columbus, his son Don Diego had been employed in soliciting Ferdinand to grant him the offices of viceroy and admiral in the New World, together with all the other im∣munities and profits which descended to him by inheritance, in consequence of the original capi∣tulation with his father. But if these dignities and revenues appeared so considerable to Ferdinand, that, at the expence of being deemed unjust as well as ungrateful, he had wrested them from Co∣lumbus, it is not surprising that he should be un∣willing to confer them on his son. Accordingly, Don Diego wasted two years in incessant but fruitless importunity. Weary of this, he endea∣voured at length to obtain, by a legal sentence,
<PB N="222" REF="034476_0220_0FFDD661EBB047C8"/>
what he could not procure from the favour of an interested monarch. He commenced a suit against Ferdinand before the council which managed In∣dian affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1509.</NOTE> and that court, with integrity which reflects honour upon its proceedings, decided against the king, and sustained Don Diego's claim of the viceroyalty, together with all the other privileges stipulated in the capitulation. Even after this decree, Ferdinand's repugnance to put a subject in possession of such extensive rights, might have thrown in new obstacles, if Don Diego had not taken a step which interested very powerful persons in the success of his claims. The sentence of the council of the Indies gave him a title to a rank so elevated, and a fortune so opulent, that he found no difficulty in concluding a marriage with Donna Maria, Daughter of Don Ferdinand de Toledo, great commendator of Leon, and brother of the Duke of Alva, a nobleman of the first rank, and nearly related to the king. The duke and his family espoused so warmly the cause of their new ally, that Ferdinand could not resist their soli∣citations. He recalled Ovando, and appointed Don Diego his successor, though, even in confer∣ring this favour, he could not conceal his jealousy; for he allowed him to assume only the title of go∣vernor, not that of viceroy, which had been ad∣judged to belong to him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 4, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>NO benefit accrued to the unhappy natives from this change of governors.

Large for∣tunes were acquired by the fishery of pearls, which was carried on with extraordinary ardour. The Indians, especially those from the Lucayo islands, were compelled to dive for them; and this dan∣gerous and unhealthy employment was an addi∣tional

<P>ABOUT this period, Juan Diaz de Solis and Pinzon set out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New voy∣ages.</NOTE> in conjunction, upon a second voyage. They stood directly south, towards the equinoctial line, which Pinzon had formerly crossed, and advanced as far as the fortieth degree of southern latitude. They were astonished to find that the continent of America stretched on their right hand, through all this vast extent of ocean. They landed in different places, to take possession in the name of their sovereign; but though the country appeared to be extremely fertile and in∣viting, their force was so small, having been sitted out rather for discovery than making settle∣ments, that they left no colony behind them. Their voyage, served, however, to give the Spa∣niards more exalted and adequate ideas with re∣spect to the dimensions of this new quarter of the globe.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">A settle∣ment on the conti∣nent at∣tempted.</NOTE>THOUGH it was about ten years since Columbus had discovered the main land of America, the Spaniards had hitherto made no settlement in any part of it.

This scheme took its rise from Alonso de Ojeda, who had already made two voyages as the discoverer, by which he acquired considerable reputation, but no wealth. But his character for intrepidity and con∣duct easily procured him associates, who advanced the money requisite to defray the charges of the

expedition. About the same time, Diego de Ni∣cuessa, who had acquired a large fortune in Hispa∣niola, formed a similar design. Ferdinand encou∣raged both; and though he refused to advance the smallest sum, was extremely liberal of titles and patents. He erected two governments on the con∣tinent, one extending from Cape de Vela to the gulf of Darien, and the other from that to Cape Gracias a Dios. The former was given to Ojeda, the latter to Nicuessa. Ojeda fitted out a ship and two brigantines, with three hundred men; Ni∣cuessa, six vessels, with seven hundred and eighty men. They sailed about the same time from St. Domingo for their respective governments. In order to give their title to those countries some appearance of validity, several of the most eminent divines and lawyers in Spain were employed to prescribe the mode in which they should take pos∣session of them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 15.</NOTE>. There is not in the history of mankind any thing more singular or extravagant than the form which they devised for this purpose. They instructed those invaders, as soon as they landed on the continent, to declare to the natives the principal articles of the Christian faith; to ac∣quaint them in particular, with the supreme juris∣diction of the Pope over all the kingdoms of the earth; to inform them of the grant which this holy pontiff had made of their country to the king of Spain; to require them to embrace the doc∣trines of that religion which the Spaniards made known to them; and to submit to the sovereign whose authority they proclaimed. If the natives refused to comply with this requisition, the terms of which must have been utterly incomprehensible to uninstructed Indians, then Ojeda and Nicuessa were authorised to attack them with fire and sword;
<PB N="226" REF="034476_0224_0FFDD66C6BF63DF0"/>
to reduce them, their wives and children, to a state of servitude; and to compel them by force to re∣cognize the jurisdiction of the church, and the au∣thority of the monarch, to which they would not voluntarily subject themselves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The dis∣asters at¦tending it.</NOTE>AS the inhabitants of the continent could not at once yield assent to doctrines too refined for their uncultivated understandings, and explained to them by interpreters imperfectly acquainted with their language; as they did not conceive how a foreign priest, of whom they had never heard, could have any right to dispose of their country, or how an un∣known prince should claim jurisdiction over them as his subjects; they fiercely opposed the new in∣vaders of their territories. Ojeda and Nicuessa endeavoured to effect by force what they could not accomplish by persuasion. The contemporary writers enter into a very minute detail in relating their transactions; but as they made no discovery of importance, nor established any permanent set∣tlement, their adventures are not entitled to any considerable place in the general history of a pe∣riod, where romantic valour, struggling with incre∣dible hardships, distinguish even effort of the Spa∣nish-arms. They found the natives in those coun∣tries of which they were to assume the government, to be of a character very different from that of their countrymen in the islands. They were fierce and warlike. Their arrows were dipped in poison so noxious, that every wound was followed with certain death.

Though the Spaniards employed every art to foothe them, and to gain their confidence, they refused to hold any intercourse,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1510.</NOTE> or to exchange any friendly office, with men whose residence among them they considered as fatal to their liberty and independence. This implacable enmity of the na∣tives, though it rendered an attempt to establish a settlement in their country extremely difficult as well as dangerous, might have been surmounted at length by the perseverance of the Spaniards, by the superiority of their arms, and their skill in the art of war. But every disaster which can be accumu∣lated upon the unfortunate, combined to complete their ruin. The loss of their ships by various acci∣dents upon an unknown coast, the diseases peculiar to a climate the most noxious in all America, the want of provisions, unavoidable in a country im∣perfectly cultivated, dissension among themselves, and the incessant hostilities of the natives, involved them in a succession of calamities, the bare recital of which strikes one with horror. Though they received two considerable reinforcements from His∣paniola, the greater part of those who had engaged in this unhappy expedition, perished, in less than a year, in the most extreme misery. A few who survived, settled as a feeble colony at Santa Maria el Antigua, on the gulf of Darien, under the com∣mand of Vasco Nugnez de Balboa, who, in the most desperate exigencies, displayed such courage and conduct, as first gained the confidence of his countrymen, and marked him out as their leader in more splendid and successful undertakings. Nor was he the only adventurer in this expedition who will appear with lustre in more important scenes, Francisco Pizarro was one of Ojeda's companions, and in this school of adversity acquired or improved the talents which sitted him for the extraordinary actions which he afterwards performed.

Cortes, whose name became still more famous, had likewise engaged early in this enterprise, which rouzed all the active youth of Hispaniola to arms; but the good fortune that accompanied him in his subsequent adventures, interposed to save him from the disasters to which his companions were exposed. He was taken ill at St. Domingo before the depar∣ture of the fleet, and detained there by a tedious indisposition.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 11, &amp;c.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Conquest of Cuba.</NOTE>NOTWITHSTANDING the unfortunate issue of this expedition, the Spaniards were not deterred from engaging in new schemes of a similar nature. When wealth is acquired gradually by the perse∣vering hand of industry, or accumulated by the slow operations of regular commerce, the means em∣ployed are so proportioned to the end attained, that there is nothing to strike the imagination, and little to urge on the active powers of the mind to uncommon efforts. But when large fortunes were created almost instantaneously; when gold and pearls were procured in exchange for baubles; when the countries which produced these rich commodities, defended only by naked savages, might be seized by the first bold invader, objects so singular and alluring, roused a wonderful spirit of enterprise among the Spaniards, who rushed with ardour into this new path that was opened to wealth and dis∣tinction. While this spirit continued warm and vigorous, every attempt either towards discovery or conquest was applauded, and adventurers engaged in it with emulation. The passion for new under∣takings, which characterises the age of discovery in the latter part of the fifteenth and beginning of the sixteenth century, would alone have been sufficient
<PB N="229" REF="034476_0227_0FFDD675556A8B40"/>
to prevent the Spaniards from stopping short in their career. But circumstances peculiar to His∣paniola at this juncture, concurred with it in ex∣tending their navigation and conquests. The ri∣gorous treatment of the inhabitants of that island, having almost extirpated the race, many of the Spanish planters, as I have already observed, find∣ing it impossible to carry on their works with the same vigour and profit, were obliged to look out for settlements in some country where people were not yet wasted by oppression. Others, with the inconsiderate levity natural to men upon whom wealth pours in with a sudden flow, had squan∣dered in thoughtless prodigality, what they acquired with ease, and were driven by necessity to embark in the most desperate schemes, in order to retrieve their affairs. From all these causes, when Don Diego Columbus proposed to conquer the island of Cuba, and to establish a colony there,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1511.</NOTE> many persons of chief distinction in Hispaniola engaged with ala∣crity in the measure. He gave the command of the troops destined for that service to Diego Velas∣quez, one of his father's companions in his second voyage, and who, having been long settled in His∣paniola, had acquired an ample fortune, with such reputation for probity and prudence, that he seemed to be well qualified for conducting an expedition of importance. Three hundred men were deemed sufficient for the conquest of an island of above seven hundred miles in length, and filled with in∣habitants. But they were of the same unwarlike character with the people of Hispaniola. They were not only intimidated by the appearance of their new enemies, but unprepared to resist them. For though, from the time that the Spaniards took possession of the adjacent island, there was reason to expect a descent on their territories; none of the small communities into which Cuba was divided,
<PB N="230" REF="034476_0228_0FFDD67817F869E0"/>
had either made any provision for its own defence, or had formed any concert for their common safety. The only obstruction the Spaniards met with was from Hatuey, a cazique, who had fled from Hispa∣niola, and had taken possession of the eastern extre∣mity of Cuba. He stood upon the defensive at their first landing, and endeavoured to drive them back to their ships. His feeble troops, however, were soon broken and dispersed; and he himself being taken prisoner, Velasquez, according to the barbarous maxim of the Spaniards, considered him as a slave who had taken arms against his master, and condemned him to the flames. When Hatuey was fastened to the stake, a Franciscan friar la∣bouring to convert him, promised him immediate admittance into the joys of heaven, if he would embrace the Chrstian faith. <Q>Are there any Spa∣niards,</Q> says he, after some pause, <Q>in that re∣gion of bliss which you describe?</Q> "Yes," replied the monk, <Q>but only such as are worthy and good.</Q> "The best of them," returned the indignant cazique, <Q>have neither worth nor good∣ness; I will not go to a place where I may meet with one of that accursed race<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B. de las Casas, p. 40.</NOTE>.</Q> This dread∣ful example of vengeance struck the people of Cuba with such terror, that they scarcely gave any op∣position to the progress of their invaders, and Velasquez, without the loss of a man, annexed this extensive and fertile island to the Spanish mo∣narchy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ix. c. 2, 3, &amp;c.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovery of Florida</NOTE>THE facility with which this important conquest was completed, served as an incitement to other undertakings. Juan Ponce de Leon, having ac∣quired both fame and wealth by the reduction of
<PB N="231" REF="034476_0229_0FFDD67AAAF36838"/>
Puerto Rico, was impatient to engage in some new enterprise. He fitted out three ships at his own expence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1512.</NOTE> for a voyage of discovery, and his reputa∣tion soon drew together a respectable body of fol∣lowers. He directed his course towards the Lucayo islands; and after touching at several of them, as well as the Bahama isles, he stood to the southwest, and discovered a country hitherto un∣known to the Spaniards, which he called Florida, either because he fell in with it on Palm Sunday, or on account of its gay and beautiful appearance. He attempted to land in different places, but met with such vigorous opposition from the natives, who were fierce and warlike, as convinced him that an in∣crease of force was requisite to effect a settlement. Satisfied with having opened a communication with a new country, of whose value and importance he conceived very sanguine hopes, he returned to Puerto Rico, through the channel now known by the name of the Gulf of Florida.</P>
<P>IT was not merely the passion of searching for new countries that prompted Ponce de Leon to undertake this voyage; he was influenced by one of those visionary ideas, which at that time often mingled with the spirit of discovery, and rendered it more active. A tradition prevailed among the natives of Puerto Rico, that in the isle of Bimini, one of the Lucayos, there was a fountain of such wonderful virtue as to renew the youth, and recal the vigour of every person who bathed in its salu∣tary waters. In hopes of finding this grand resto∣rative, Ponce de Leon and his followers ranged through the islands, searching, with fruitless solici∣tude and labour for the fountain, which was the chief object of their expedition. That a tale so fabulous should gain credit among simple unin∣structed Indians is not surprising. That it should make any impression upon an enlightened peo∣ple
<PB N="232" REF="034476_0230_0FFDD67D43BF8C88"/>
appears in the present age, altogether in∣credible. The fact, however, is certain; and the most authentic Spanish historians mention this ex∣travagant sally of their credulous countrymen. The Spaniards, at that period, were engaged in a career of activity which gave a romantic turn to their imagination, and daily presented to them strange and marvellous objects. A New World was opened to their view. They visited islands and continents, of whose existence mankind in former ages had no conception. In those delightful countries nature seemed to assume another form: every tree and plant and animal was different from those of the ancient hemisphere. They seemed to be trans∣ported into enchanted ground; and, after the won∣ders which they had seen, nothing, in the warmth and novelty of their admiration, appeared to them so extraordinary as to be beyond belief. If the ra∣pid succession of new and striking scenes made such impression even upon the sound understanding of Columbus, that he boasted of having found the seat of Paradise, it will not appear strange that Ponce de Leon should dream of discovering the fountain of youth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P.

Balboa having been raised to the government of the small colony at Santa Maria in Darien, by the voluntary suffrage of his associates, was so extremely desirous to obtain from the crown a confirmation of their election, that he dispatched one of his officers to Spain, in order to solicit a royal commission, which might invest him with a legal title to the supreme command. Con∣scious,

however, that he could not expect success from the patronage of Ferdinand's ministers, with whom he was unconnected, or from negociating in a court to the arts of which he was a stranger, he endeavoured to merit the dignity to which he aspired, and aimed at performing some signal ser∣vice that would secure him the preference to every competitor. Full of this idea, he made frequent inroads into the adjacent country, subdued several of the caziques, and collected a considerable quan∣tity of gold, which abounded more in that part of the continent than in the islands. In one of those excursions, the Spaniards contended with such eagerness about the division of some gold, that they were at the point of proceeding to acts of vio∣lence against one another. A young cazique, who was present, astonished at the high value which they set upon a thing of which he did not discern the use, tumbled the gold out of the balance with indignation; and, turning to the Spaniards, "Why do you quarrel (says he) about such a trifle? If you are so passionately fond of gold, as to abandon your own country, and to disturb the tranquillity of distant nations for its sake, I will conduct you to a region where the metal which seems to be the chief object of your admiration and desire, is so common that the meanest utensils are formed of it." Transported with what they heard, Balboa and his companions inquired eagerly where this happy country lay, and how they might arrive at it. He informed them that at the distance of six suns, that is of six days journey towards the south, they should discover another ocean, near to which this wealthy kingdom was situated; but if they in∣tended to attack that powerful state, they must as∣semble forces far superior in number and strength to those with which they now appeared <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ix. c. 2.

<P><PB N="234" REF="034476_0232_0FFDD681DFB35758"/>THIS was the first information which the Spa∣niards received concerning the great southern ocean, or the opulent and extensive country known afterwards by the name of Peru.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The schemes which he forms.</NOTE> Balboa had now before him objects suited to his boundless ambition, and the enterprising ardour of his genius. He im∣mediately concluded the ocean which the cazique mentioned, to be that for which Columbus had searched without success in this part of America, in hopes of opening a more direct communication with the East Indies; and he conjectured that the rich territory which had been described to him, must be part of that vast and opulent region of the earth. Elated with the idea of performing what so great a man had attempted in vain; and eager to accomplish a discovery which he knew would be no less acceptable to the king than beneficial to his country, he was impatient until he could set out upon this enterprise, in comparison of which all his former exploits appeared inconsiderable. But previous arrangement and preparation were requi∣site to ensure success. He began with courting and securing the friendship of the neighbouring ca∣ziques. He sent some of his officers to Hispa∣niola with a large quantity of gold, as a proof of his past success, and an earnest of his future hopes. By a proper distribution of this, they secured the favour of the governor, and allured volunteers into the service. A considerable reinforcement from that island joined him, and he thought himself in a condition to attempt the discovery.</P>

The mountains are covered

with forests almost inaccessible. The valleys in that moist climate, where it rains during two-thirds of the year, are marshy, and so frequently overflowed, that the inhabitants find it necessary, in many places, to build their houses upon trees, in order to be ele∣vated at some distance from the damp soil, and the odious reptiles engendered in the putrid waters<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P.

In a region thinly inha∣bited by wandering savages, the hand of industry had done nothing to mitigate or correct those natu∣ral disadvantages. To march across this unexplored country with no other guides but Indians, whose fidelity could be little trusted, was, on all those ac∣counts, the boldest enterprise on which the Spa∣niards had hitherto ventured in the New World. But the intrepidity of Balboa was such as distin∣guished him among his countrymen, at a period when every adventurer was conspicuous for daring courage. Nor was bravery his only merit;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1513.</NOTE> he was prudent in conduct, generous, affable, and possessed of those popular talents which, in the most despe∣rate undertakings, inspire confidence and secure at∣tachment. Even after the junction of the volun∣teers from Hispaniola, he was able to muster only an hundred and ninety men for his expedition. But they were hard veterans, inured to the climate of America, and ready to follow him through every danger. A thousand Indians attended them to carry their provisions; and to complete their warlike ar∣ray, they took with them several of those fierce dogs, which were no less formidable than destruc∣tive to their naked enemies.</P>
<P>BALBOA set out upon this important expedition on the first of September,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Sea.</NOTE> about the time that the periodical rains began to abate. He proceeded by

sea, and without any difficulty, to the territories of a cazique whose friendship he had gained; but no sooner did he begin to advance into the interior part of the country, than he was retarded by every ob∣stacle, which he had reason to apprehend, from the nature of the territory, or the disposition of its inha∣bitants. Some of the caziques, at his approach, fled to the mountains with all their people, and car∣ried off or destroyed whatever could afford subsist∣ence to his troops. Others collected their subjects, in order to oppose his progress, and he quickly per∣ceived what an arduous undertaking it was, to con∣duct such a body of men through hostile nations, across swamps and rivers, and woods, which had never been passed but by straggling Indians. But by sharing in every hardship with the meanest sol∣dier, by appearing the foremost to meet every dan∣ger, by promising confidently to his troops the enjoyment of honour and riches superior to what had been attained by the most successful of their countrymen, he inspired them with such enthusi∣astic resolution, that they followed him without murmuring. When they had penetrated a good way into the mountains, a powerful cazique ap∣peared in a narrow pass, with a numerous body of his subjects, to obstruct their progress. But men who had surmounted so many obstacles, despised the opposition of such feeble enemies. They at∣tacked them with impetuosity, and having dispersed them with much ease and great slaughter, continued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir march. Though their guides had represented the breadth of the isthmus to be only a journey of six days, they had already spent twenty-five in forcing their way through the woods and mountains. Many of them were ready to sink under such un∣interrupted fatigue in that sultry climate, several were taken ill of the dysentery and other diseases frequent in that country, and all became impatient
<PB N="237" REF="034476_0235_0FFDD68A01BA6DB8"/>
to reach the period of their labours and sufferings. At length the Indians assured them, that from the top of the next mountain they should discover the ocean which was the object of their wishes. When, with infinite toil, they had climbed up the greater part of that steep ascent, Balboa commanded his men to halt, and advanced alone to the summit, that he might be the first who should enjoy a spec∣tacle which he had so long desired. As soon as he beheld the South Sea stretching in endless prospect below him, he fell on his knees, and lifting up his hands to Heaven, returned thanks to God, who had conducted him to a discovery so beneficial to his country, and so honourable to himself. His followers, observing his transports of joy, rushed forward to join in his wonder, exultation and gra∣titude. They held on their course to the shore with great alacrity, when Balboa advancing up to the middle in the waves with his buckler and sword, took possession of that ocean in the name of the king his master, and vowed to defend it, with these arms, against all his enemies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. x. c. 1, &amp;c.

<P>THAT part of the great Pacific or Southern Ocean, which Balboa first discovered, still retains the name of the Gulf of St. Michael, which he gave to it, and is situated to the east of Panama. From several of the petty princes, who governed in the districts adjacent to that gulf, he extorted provisions and gold by force of arms. Others sent them to him voluntarily. To these acceptable pre∣sents, some of the caziques added a considerable quantity of pearls; and he learned from them, with much satisfaction, that pearl oysters abounded in the sea which he had newly discovered.</P>
<P>TOGETHER with the acquisition of this wealth,
<PB N="238" REF="034476_0236_0FFDD68DC222E7D0"/>

As the Llama, in its form, nearly resembles a camel, a beast of burden deemed peculiar to Asia, this circumstance in conjunction with the discovery of the pearls, another noted production of that country, tended to confirm the Spaniards in their mistaken theory with respect to the vicinity of the New World to the East Indies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. x. c. 2.</NOTE></P>

He determined to lead back his followers, at present, to their settlement at Santa Maria in Darien, and to return next season with a force more adequate to such an arduous en∣terprize.

<P>BALBOA'S first care was to send information to Spain of the important discovery which he had made,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ias appointed governor of Darien.</NOTE> and to demand a reinforcement of a thou∣sand men, in order to attempt the conquest of that opulent country, concerning which he had received such inviting intelligence. The first account of the discovery of the New World hardly occasioned greater joy, than the unexpected tidings that a passage was at last found to the great southern ocean. The communication with the East Indies, by a course to the westward of the line of demarkation, drawn by the Pope, seemed now to be almost certain. The vast wealth which flowed into Portugal from its extensive settlements and conquests in that country, excited the envy, and called forth the emulation of other states. Ferdinand hoped now to come in for a share in this lucrative commerce, and in his eagerness to obtain, it was willing to make an effort beyond what Balboa required. But even in this exertion, his jealous policy, as well as the fatal antipathy of Fonseca, now Bishop of Bur∣gos, to every man of merit who distinguished him∣self in the New World, were conspicuous. Not∣withstanding Balboa's recent services, which marked him out as the most proper person to finish that great undertaking which he had begun, Ferdinand
<PB N="240" REF="034476_0238_0FFDD692F5CF5460"/>
was so ungenerous as to overlook these, and to ap∣point Pedrarias Davila governor of Darien. He gave him the command of fifteen stout vessels, and twelve hundred soldiers. These were fitted out at the public expence, with a liberality which Ferdi∣nand had never displayed in any former armament destined for the New World; and such was the ar∣dour of the Spanish gentlemen to follow a leader who was about to conduct them to a country, where, as fame reported, they had only to throw their nets into the sea and draw out gold<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. x. c. 14.</NOTE>, that fifteen hun∣dred embarked on board the fleet, and if they had not been restrained, a much greater number would have engaged in the service<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. dec. 1. lib. x. c. 6, 7.

<P>PEDRARIAS reached the gulf of Darien with∣out any remarkable accident, and immediately sent some of his principal officers ashore to inform Bal∣boa of his arrival, with the king's commission, to be governor of the colony. To their astonishment, they found Balboa, of whose great exploits they had heard so much, and of whose opulence they had formed such high ideas, clad in a canvas jacket, and wearing coarse hempen sandals used only by the meanest peasants, employed, together with some Indians, in thatching his own hut with reeds. Even in this simple garb, which corresponded so ill with the expectations and wishes of his new guests, Bal∣boa received them with dignity. The fame of his discoveries had drawn so many adventurers from the islands, that he could now muster four hundred and fifty men. At the head of those daring vete∣rans, he was more than a match for the force which Pedrarias brought with him. But though his troops murmured loudly at the injustice of the king in superseding their commander, and com∣plained
<PB N="241" REF="034476_0239_0FFDD69595BB1C40"/>
that strangers would now reap the fruits of their toil and success, Balboa submitted with impli∣cit obedience to the will of his sovereign, and re∣ceived Pedrarias with all the deference due to his character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. x. c. 13, 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this moderation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissension between him and Balboa.</NOTE> to which Pedrarias owed the peaceable possession of his go∣vernment, he appointed a judicial inquiry to be made into Balboa's conduct, while under the com∣mand of Nicuessa, and imposed a considerable fine upon him, on account of the irregularities of which he had then been guilty. Balboa felt sensibly the mortification of being subjected to trial and to pu∣nishment in a place where he had so lately occupied the first station. Pedrarias could not conceal his jealousy of his superior merit; so that the resent∣ment of the one, and the envy of the other, gave rise to dissentions extremely detrimental to the co∣lony. It was threatened with a calamity still more fatal.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July.</NOTE> Pedrarias had landed in Darien at a most unlucky time of the year, about the middle of the rainy season, in that part of the torrid zone where the clouds pour down such torrents as are unknown in more temperate climates<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Richard Hist.

An extreme scarcity of provisions augmented this distress, as it rendered it impossible to find proper refreshment for the sick, or the necessary sustenance for the healthy<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. x. c. 14.

persons perished in the utmost misery. De∣jection and despair spread through the colony. Many principal persons solicited their dismission, and were glad to relinquish all their hopes of wealth, in order to escape from that pernicious re∣gion. Pedrarias endeavoured to divert those who remained from brooding over their misfortunes, by finding them employment. With this view, he sent several detachments into the interior parts of the country, to levy gold among the natives, and to search for the mines in which it was produced. Those rapacious adventurers, more attentive to pre∣sent gain than to the means of facilitating their fu∣ture progress, plundered without distinction where∣ever they marched. Regardless of the alliances which Balboa had made with several of the ca∣ziques, they stripped them of every thing valuable, and treated them, as well as their subjects, with the utmost insolence and cruelty. By their tyranny and exactions, which Pedrarias, either from want of authority or of inclination, did not restrain, all the country from the Gulf of Darien to the Lake of Nicaragua was desolated, and the Spaniards were inconsiderately deprived of the advantages which they might have derived from the friendship of the natives, in extending their conquests to the South Sea. Balboa, who saw with concern that such ill-judged proceedings retarded the execution of his favourite scheme, sent violent remonstrances to Spain against the imprudent government of Pedra∣rias, which had ruined a happy and flourishing co∣lony. Pedrarias, on the other hand, accused him of having deceived the king, by magnifying his own exploits, as well as by a false representation of the opulence and value of the country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. x. c. 15. dec. 2. c. 1, &amp;c.

Pedrarias continued to treat his rival with neglect; and Bal∣boa's fortune being exhausted by the payment of his fine, and other exactions of Pedrarias, he could not make suitable preparations for taking possession of his new government. At length, by the inter∣position and exhortations of the bishop of Darien, they were brought to a reconciliation; and, in or∣der to cement this union more firmly, Pedrarias agreed to give his daughter in marriage to Balboa. The first effect of their concord was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1516.</NOTE> that Balboa was permitted to make several small incursions into the country. These he conducted with such pru∣dence, as added to the reputation which he had al∣ready acquired.

an unexpected message from Pedrarias<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. i. c. 3. lib. ii. c. 11.13.21.</NOTE>. As his reconciliation with Balboa had never been cor∣dial, the progress which his son-in-law was making revived his ancient enmity, and added to its ran∣cour. He dreaded the prosperity and elevation of a man whom he had injured so deeply. He suspect∣ed that success would encourage him to aim at in∣dependence upon his jurisdiction; and so violently did the passions of hatred, fear, and jealousy, ope∣rate upon his mind, that, in order to gratify his vengeance, he scrupled not to defeat an enterprise of the greatest moment to his country. Under pretexts which were false, but plausible, he desired Balboa to postpone his voyage for a short time, and to repair to Acla, in order that he might have an interview with him. Balboa, with the unsuspicious confidence of a man conscious of no crime, in∣stantly obeyed the summons; but as soon as he en∣tered the place, he was arrested by order of Pedra∣rias, whose impatience to satiate his revenge did not suffer him to languish long in confinement. Judges were immediately appointed to proceed to his trial. An accusation of disloyalty to the king, and of an intention to revolt against the governor, was preferred against him. Sentence of death was pronounced; and though the judges who passed it, seconded by the whole colony, interceded warmly for his pardon, Pedrarias continued inexorable; and the Spaniards beheld, with astonishment and sorrow, the public execution of a man whom they univer∣sally deemed more capable than any who had borne command in America, of forming and accomplish∣ing great designs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ii. c. 21, 22.</NOTE>.

proceedings, was not only screened from punish∣ment by the powerful patronage of the bishop of Burgos and other courtiers, but continued in power. Soon after, he obtained permission to remove the colony from its unwholesome station of Santa Ma∣ria to Panama, on the opposite side of the isth∣mus; and though it did not gain much in point of healthfulness by the change, the commodious situ∣ation of this new settlement contributed greatly to facilitate the subsequent conquests of the Spaniards in the extensive countries situated upon the South∣ern Ocean<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. iv. c. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>DURING these transactions in Darien,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1515.

Ferdinand was so intent upon opening a communi∣cation with the Molucca or Spice Islands by the west, that, in the year one thousand five hundred and fifteen, he fitted out two ships at his own ex∣pence, in order to attempt such a voyage, and gave the command of them to Juan Diaz de Solis, who was deemed one of the most skilful navigators in Spain. He stood along the coast of South Ame∣rica, and on the first of January one thousand five hundred and sixteen, entered a river which he cal∣led Janeiro, where an extensive commerce is now carried on. From thence he proceeded to a spa∣cious bay, which he supposed to be the entrance into a strait that communicated with the Indian ocean; but upon advancing farther, he found it to be the mouth of Rio de Plata, one of the vast rivers by which the southern continent of America is watered. In endeavouring to make a descent in this country, De Solis and several of his crew were slain by the natives, who, in sight of the ships, cut their bodies

in pieces, roasted and devoured them. Discou∣raged with the loss of their commander, and terrified at this shocking spectacle, the surviving Spaniards set sail for Europe, without aiming at any farther discovery<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. i. c. 7. P. Martyr, dec. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. p 317.</NOTE>. Though this attempt proved abortive, it was not without benefit. It turned the attention of ingenious men to this course of navigation, and prepared the way for a more fortunate voyage, by which, a few years posterior to this period, the great design that Ferdinand had in view was ac∣complished.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the colony in Hisponiola.</NOTE>THOUGH the Spaniards were thus actively em∣ployed in extending their discoveries and settle∣ments in America, they still considered Hispaniola as their principal colony, and the seat of govern∣ment. Don Diego Columbus wanted neither in∣clination nor abilities to have rendered the mem∣bers of this colony, who were most immediately under his jurisdiction, prosperous and happy. But he was circumscribed in all his operations by the suspicious policy of Ferdinand, who on every occa∣sion, and under pretexts the most frivolous, re∣trenched his privileges, and encouraged the trea∣surer, the judges, and other subordinate officers, to counteract his measures, and to dispute his au∣thority. The most valuable prerogative which the governor possessed, was that of distributing In∣dians among the Spaniards settled in the island. The rigorous servitude of those unhappy men hav∣ing been but little mitigated by all the regulations in their favour, the power of parcelling out such necessary instruments of labour at pleasure, secured to the governor great influence in the colony. In order to strip him of this, Ferdinand created a new office, with the power of distributing the Indians, and bestowed it upon Rodrigo Albuquerque, a rela∣tion
<PB N="247" REF="034476_0245_0FFDD6A682F9F298"/>
of Zapata, his confidential minister. Mortified with the injustice, as well as indignity, of this inva∣sion upon his rights, in a point so essential, Don Diego could no longer remain in a place where his power and consequence were almost annihilated. He repaired to Spain with the vain hopes of obtain∣ing redress<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ix. c. 5. lib. x. c. 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>. Albuquerque entered upon his of∣fice with all the rapacity of an indigent adventurer, impatient to amass wealth. He began with taking the exact number of Indians in the island, and found, that from sixty thousand, who, in the year one thousand five hundred and eight, survived after all their sufferings, they were now reduced to four∣teen thousand. These he threw into separate divi∣sions or lots, and bestowed them upon such as were willing to purchase them at the highest price. By this arbitrary distribution, several of the natives were removed from their original habitations, many were taken from their ancient masters, and all of them subjected to heavier burdens, and to more in∣tolerable labour, in order to reimburse their new proprietors. Those additional calamities completed the misery, and hastened on the extinction of this wretched and innocent race of men<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. x. c. 12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE violence of these proceedings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Controver∣sy with re∣spect to the treatment of the Indi∣ans.</NOTE> together with the fatal consequences which attended them, not only excited complaints among such as thought themselves aggrieved, but touched the hearts of all who retained any sentiments of humanity. From the time that Ecclesiastics were sent as instructors into America, they perceived that the rigour with which their countrymen treated the natives, ren∣dered their ministry altogether fruitless. The mis∣sionaries, in conformity to the mild spirit of that religion which they were employed to publish, early
<PB N="248" REF="034476_0246_0FFDD6A812FE26F0"/>
remonstrated against the maxims of the planters with respect to the Americans, and condemned the repartimientos, or distributions, by which they were given up as slaves to their conquerors, as no less contrary to natural justice and the precepts of Christianity, than to sound policy. The Domini∣cans, to whom the instruction of the Americans was originally committed, were most vehement in testifying against the repartimientos. In the year one thousand five hundred and eleven, Montesino, one of their most eminent preachers, inveighed against this practice in the great church at St. Do∣mingo, with all the impetuosity of popular elo∣quence. Don Diego Columbus, the principal officers of the colony, and all the laymen who had been his hearers, complained of the monk to his superiors; but they, instead of condemning ap∣plauded his doctrine, as equally pious and season∣able. The Franciscans, influenced by the spirit of opposition and rivalship which subsists between the two orders, discovered some inclination to take part with the laity, and to espouse the defence of the repartimientos. But as they could not with decency give their avowed approbation to a system of oppres∣sion, so repugnant to the spirit of religion, they endeavoured to palliate what they could not justify, and alledged, in excuse for the conduct of their countrymen, that it was impossible to carry on any improvement in the colony, unless the Spaniards possessed such dominion over the natives, that they could compel them to labour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec 1. lib. viii. c. 11.

Both parties applied to the king for his decision in a matter of such import∣ance. Ferdinand empowered a committee of his privy-council, assisted by some of the most emi∣nent civilians and divines in Spain, to hear the deputies sent from Hispaniola, in support of their respective opinions. After a long discussion, the speculative point in controversy was determined in favour of the Dominicians, the Indians were de∣clared to be a free people, intitled to all the na∣tural rights of men; but, notwithstanding this decision, the repartimientos were continued upon their ancient footing<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. viii. c. 12. lib. ix. c 5.</NOTE>. As this determination admitted the principle upon which the Dominicans founded their opinion, they renewed their efforts to obtain relief for the Indians with additional bold∣ness and zeal. At length, in order to quiet the colony, which was alarmed by their remonstrances and censures, Ferdinand issued a decree of his privy council, declaring, that after mature consi∣deration of the Apostolic Bull, and other titles by which the crown of Castile claimed a right to its possessions in the New World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1513.</NOTE> the servitude of the Indians was warranted by both the laws of God and of man; that unless they were subjected to the do∣minion of the Spaniards, and compelled to reside under their inspection, it would be impossible to reclaim them from idolatry, or to instruct them in the principles of the Christian faith; that no far∣ther scruple ought to be entertained concerning the lawfulness of the repartimientos, as the king and council were willing to take the charge of that upon their own consciences; and that therefore the Dominicians, and Monks of other religious

But in order that he might not seem altogether in∣attentive to the rights of humanity, he published an edict, in which he endeavoured to provide for the mild treatment of the Indians under the yoke to which he subjected them; he regulated the nature of the work which they should be required to perform, he prescribed the mode in which they should be clothed and fed, and gave directions with respect to their instruction in the principles of Chris∣tianity<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ix. c. 14.</NOTE>.</P>

They considered it as vain to waste their own time and strength in attempting to commu∣nicate the sublime truths of religion to men, whose spirits were broken, and their faculties impaired by oppression. Some of them, in despair, re∣quested the permission of their superiors to remove to the continent, and pursue the object of their mis∣sion among such of the natives as were not hitherto corrupted by the example of the Spaniards, or ali∣enated by their cruelty from the Christian faith. Such as remained in Hispaniola continued to remon∣strate,

This was Bartholomew de las Casas, a native of Seville, and one of the clergymen sent out with Columbus in his second voyage to Hispaniola, in order to settle in that island. He early adopted the opinion prevalent among ecclesiastics, with respect to the unlawfulness of reducing the natives to servitude; and that he might demonstrate the sincerity of his conviction, he relinquished all the Indians who had fallen to his own share in the division of the inha∣bitants among their conquerors, declaring that he should ever bewail his own misfortune and guilt, in having exercised for a moment this impious domi∣nion over his fellow creatures<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fr.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Solicits their cause in the court of Spain.</NOTE>HE easily obtained admittance to the king, whom he found in a declining state of health. With much freedom, and no less eloquence, he repre∣sented to him all the fatal effects of the repartimientos in the New World, boldly charging him with the guilt of having authorised this impious measure, which had brought misery and destruction upon a numerous and innocent race of men, whom Provi∣pence had placed under his protection. Ferdinand, whose mind as well as body was much enfeebled by his distemper, was greatly alarmed at this charge of impiety, which at another juncture he would have despised. He listened with deep compunction to the discourse of Las Casas, and promised to take into serious consideration the means of redressing the evil of which he complained. But death pre∣vented him from executing his resolution. Charles of Austria, to whom all his crowns devolved, resided at that time in his paternal dominions in the Low Countries. Las Casas, with his usual ardour, pre∣pared immediately to set out for Flanders, in order to occupy the ear of the young monarch, when car∣dinal Ximenes, who, as regent, assumed the reins of government in Castile, commanded him to desist from the journey, and engaged to hear his com∣plaints in person.</P>

of Ferdinand. Without regarding either the rights of Don Diego Columbus, or the regula∣tions established by the late king,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1517.</NOTE> he resolved to send three persons to America as superintendants of all the colonies there, with authority, after examin∣ing all circumstances on the spot, to decide finally with respect to the point in question. It was a matter of deliberation and delicacy to chuse men qualified for such an important station. As all the laymen settled in America, or who had been con∣sulted in the administration of that department, had given their opinion that the Spaniards could not keep possession of their new settlements, unless they were allowed to retain their dominion over the Indians, he saw that he could not rely on their im∣partiality, and determined to commit the trust to ecclesiastics. As the Dominicans and Franciscans had already espoused opposite sides in the contro∣versy, he, from the same principle of impartiality, excluded both these fraternities from the commis∣sion. He confined his choice to the monks of St. Jerome, a small, but respectable order in Spain. With the assistance of their general, and in concert with Las Casas, he soon pitched upon three persons whom he deemed equal to the charge. To them he joined Zuazo, a private lawyer of distinguished probity, with unbounded power to regulate all judicial proceedings in the colonies. Las Casas was appointed to accom∣pany them, with the title of protector of the Indians<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ii. c. 3</NOTE>.</P>

ministers of the late king, a measure so wild and dan∣gerous, that they refused to issue the dispatches ne∣cessary for carrying it into execution. But Xime∣nes was not of a temper patiently to brook oppo∣sition to any of his schemes. He sent for the refractory ministers, and addressed them in such a tone, that in the utmost consternation they obeyed his orders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ii. c. 6.</NOTE>. The superintendants, with their asso∣ciate Zuazo, and Las Casas, sailed for St. Domingo. Upon their arrival, the first act of their authority was to set at liberty all the Indians who had been granted to the Spanish courtiers, or to any person not residing in America. This, together with the information which had been received from Spain concerning the object of the commission, spread a general alarm. The colonists concluded that they were to be deprived at once of the hands with which they carried on their labour, and that, of consequence, ruin was unavoidable. But the fa∣thers of St. Jerome proceeded with such caution and prudence, as soon dissipated all their fears. They discovered, in every step of their conduct, a knowledge of the world, and of affairs, which is seldom acquired in a cloister; and displayed a mo∣deration as well as gentleness still more rare among persons trained up in the solitude and austerity of a monastic life. Their ears were open to information from every quarter, they compared the different accounts which they received, and, after a mature consideration of the whole, they were fully satisfied that the state of the colony rendered it impossible to adopt the plan proposed by Las Casas, and re∣commended by the Cardinal. They plainly per∣ceived that the Spaniards settled in America were so few in number, that they could neither work the mines which had been opened, nor cultivate the
<PB N="255" REF="034476_0253_0FFDD6BC729BB040"/>
country; that they depended for effecting both, upon the labour of the natives, and if deprived of it, they must instantly relinquish their conquests, or give up all the advantages which they derived from them; that no allurement was so powerful as to surmount the natural aversion of the Indians to any laborious effort, and that nothing but the au∣thority of a master could compel them to work; and if they were not kept constantly under the eye and discipline of a superior, so great was their na∣tural listlessness and indifference, that they would neither attend to religious instruction, nor observe those rites of Christianity which they had been al∣ready taught. Upon all those accounts, the super∣intendants found it necessary to tolerate the repar∣timientos, and to suffer the Indians to remain under subjection to their Spanish masters. They used their utmost endeavours, however, to prevent the fatal effects of this establishment, and to secure to the Indians the consolation of the best treatment compatible with a state of servitude. For this pur∣pose, they revived former regulations, they pre∣scribed new ones, they neglected no circumstance that tended to mitigate the rigour of the yoke; and by their authority, their example and their exhortations, they laboured to inspire their coun∣trymen with sentiments of equity and gentleness towards the unhappy people upon whose industry they depended. Zuazo, in his department, se∣conded the endeavours of the superintendants. He reformed the courts of justice, in such a manner as to render their decisions equitable as well as ex∣peditious, and introduced various regulations which greatly improved the interior police of the colony. The satisfaction which his conduct, and that of the superintendants gave, was now universal among the Spaniards settled in the New World, and all ad∣mired the boldness of Ximenes, in having departed
<PB N="256" REF="034476_0254_0FFDD6BE07221490"/>

He contended, that the Indians were naturally free, and, as their protector, he required the superintendants not to bereave them of the common privilege of huma∣nity. They received his most virulent remon∣strances without emotion, but adhered firmly to their own system. The Spanish planters did not bear with him so patiently, and were ready to tear him in pieces for insisting in a requisition so odious to them. Las Casas, in order to screen himself from their rage, found it necessary to take shelter in a convent; and perceiving that all his efforts in America were fruitless, he soon set out for Europe, with a fixed resolution not to abandon the pro∣tection of a people whom he deemed to be cruelly oppressed<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ii. c 16.</NOTE>.</P>

Charles arrived, took possession of the govern∣ment, and, by the death of Ximenes, lost a minister, whose abilities and integrity intitled him to direct his affairs. Many of the Flemish nobility had ac∣companied their sovereign to Spain. From that warm predilection to his countrymen, which was natural at his age, he consulted them with respect to all the transactions in his new kingdom, and they with an indiscreet eagerness, intruded them∣selves into every business, and seized almost every department of administration<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hist. of Charles V. vol. ii. p. 43.</NOTE>. The direction of American affairs was an object too alluring to escape their attention. Las Casas observed their growing influence, and though projectors are usually too sanguine to conduct their schemes with much dexterity, he possessed a bustling indefati∣gable activity, which sometimes accomplishes its purposes with greater success, than the most ex∣quisite discernment and address. He courted the Flemish Ministers with assiduity. He represented to them the absurdity of all the maxims hitherto adopted with respect to the government of Ame∣rica, particularly during the administration of Fer∣dinand, and pointed out the defects of those arrangements which Ximenes had introduced. The memory of Ferdinand was odious to the Flemings. The superior virtue and abilities of Ximenes had long been the object of their envy. They fondly wished to have a plausible pretext for condemning the measures, both of the mo∣narch and of the minister, and of reflecting some discredit on their political wisdom. The friends of Don Diego Columbus, as well as the Spanish courtiers, who had been dissatisfied with the Car∣dinal's administration, joined Las Casas in censuring the scheme of sending superintendants to America.

This union of many interests and passions was irresistible; and, in consequence of it, the fathers of St, Jerome, together with their associate Zuazo, were recalled. Roderigo de Figueroa, a lawyer of some eminence, was appointed chief judge of the island, and received instructions, in compliance with the request of Las Casas, to ex∣amine once more, with the utmost attention, the point in controversy between him and the people of the colony, with respect to the treatment of the natives; and in the mean time to do every thing in his power to alleviate their sufferings, and prevent the extinction of the race<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ii. c. 16.19.21. lib. iii. c. 7, 8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Scheme of supplying the colony with ne∣groes.</NOTE>THIS was all that the zeal of Las Casas could procure, at that juncture, in favour of the Indians. The impossibility of carrying on any improvement in America, unless the Spanish planters could command the labour of the natives, was an insu∣perable objection to his plan of treating them as free subjects. In order to provide some remedy for this, without which he found it was in vain to mention his scheme, Las Casas proposed to pur∣chase a sufficient number of negroes from the Por∣tuguese settlements on the coast of Africa, and to transport them to America, in order that they might be employed as slaves in working the mines and cultivating the ground. One of the first ad∣vantages which the Portuguese had derived from their descoveries in Africa, arose from the trade in slaves. Various circumstances concurred in reviv∣ing this odious commerce, which had been long abolished in Europe, and which is no less repug∣nant to the feelings of humanity, than to the prin∣ciples of religion. As early as the year one thousand five hundred and three, a few negro slaves had been sent into the New World<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. v. c. 12.</NOTE>. In
<PB N="259" REF="034476_0257_0FFDD6C61B3C36B8"/>
the year one thousand five hundred and eleven, Ferdinand permitted the importation of them in greater numbers<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib. viii. c. 9.</NOTE>. They were found to be a more robust and hardy race than the natives of America. They were more capable of enduring fatigue, more patient under servitude, and the labour of one ne∣gro was computed to be equal to that of four In∣dians<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. lib. 9. c. 5.</NOTE>. Cardinal Ximenes, however, when soli∣cited to encourage this commerce, peremptorily rejected the proposition, because he perceived the iniquity of reducing one race of men to slavery, while he was consulting about the means of restor∣ing liberty to another<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ii. c. 8</NOTE>. But Las Casas, from the inconsistency natural to men who hurry with head-long impetuosity towards a favourite point, was incapable of making this distinction. While he contended earnestly for the liberty of the people born in one quarter of the globe, he laboured to enslave the inhabitants of another region; and in the warmth of his zeal to save the Americans from the yoke, pronounced it to be lawful and expedient to impose one still heavier upon the Africans. Unfortunately for the latter, Las Casas's plan was adopted. Charles granted a patent to one of his Flemish favourites, containing an exclusive right of importing four thousand negroes into America. The favourite sold his patent to some Genoese merchants for twenty-five thousand ducats, and they were the first who brought into a regular form that commerce for slaves between Africa and Ame∣rica, which has since been carried on to such an amazing extent<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ibid. dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 20.</NOTE>.</P>

that the number imported into Hispaniola made no great change upon the state of the colony. Las Casas, whose zeal was no less inventive than indefatigable, had recourse to another expedient for the relief of the Indians. He observed, that most of the persons who had settled hitherto in America, were sailors and soldiers employed in the discovery or conquest of the country; the younger sons of noble families, allured by the prospect of acqui∣ring sudden wealth; or desperate adventurers, whom their indigence or crimes forced to abandon their native land. Instead of such men, who were disso∣lute, rapacious, and incapable of that sober perse∣vering industry which is requisite in forming new colonies, he proposed to supply the settlements in Hispaniola and other parts of the New World with a sufficient number of labourers and husbandmen, who should be allured by suitable premiums to re∣move thither. These, as they were accustomed to fatigue, would be able to perform the work, to which the Indians, from the feebleness of their con∣stitution, were unequal, and might soon become useful and opulent citizens. But though Hispaniola stood much in need of a recruit of inhabitants, ha∣ving been visited at this time with the small pox, which swept off almost all the natives who had sur∣vived their long-continued oppression, and though Las Casas had the countenance of the Flemish mi∣nisters, this scheme was defeated by the bishop of Burgos, who thwarted all his projects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ii. c. 21.</NOTE>.</P>

The evil was become so inveterate there, as not to admit of a cure. But such discoveries were daily making in the continent, as gave an high idea both of its extent and popu∣lousness.
<PB N="261" REF="034476_0259_0FFDD6CA49354CC0"/>
In all those vast regions there was but one feeble colony planted; and except a small spot on the isthmus of Darien, the natives still occupied the whole country. This opened a new and more ample field for the humanity and zeal of Las Casas, who flattered himself that he might prevent a per∣nicious system from being introduced there, though he had failed of success in his attempts to overturn it, where it was already established. Full of this idea, he applied for a grant of the unoccupied country, stretching along the sea-coast from the gulf of Paria to the western frontier of that province now known by the name of Santa Martha. He proposed to settle there with a colony composed of husbandmen, labourers, and ecclesiastics. He en∣gaged, in the space of two years, to civilize ten thousand of the natives, and to instruct them so thoroughly in the arts of social life, that, from the fruits of their industry, an annual revenue of fifteen thousand ducats should arise to the king. In ten years he expected that his improvements would be so far advanced, as to yield annually sixty thousand ducats. He stipulated, that no sailor or soldier should ever be permitted to settle in this district; and that no Spaniard whatever should enter it with∣out his permission. He even projected to clothe the people whom he took along with him in some distinguishing garb, which did not resemble the Spanish dress, that they might appear to the natives to be a different race of men from those who had brought so many calamities upon their country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. iv. c. 2.</NOTE>. From this scheme, of which I have traced only the great lines, it is manifest that Las Casas had formed ideas concerning the method of treating the Indi∣ans, similar to those by which the Jesuits afterwards carried on their great operations in another part of
<PB N="262" REF="034476_0260_0FFDD6CCF18D1EA0"/>
the same continent. He supposed that the Europe∣ans, by availing themselves of that ascendant which they possessed in consequence of their superior pro∣gress in science and improvements, might gradually form the minds of the Americans to relish those comforts of which they were destitute, might train them to the arts of civil life, and render them ca∣pable of its functions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Favourably received.</NOTE>BUT to the bishop of Burgos and the council of the Indies this project appeared not only chime∣rical, but dangerous in a high degree. They deemed the faculties of the Americans to be natu∣rally so limited, and their indolence so excessive, that every attempt to instruct or to improve them would be fruitless. They contended that it would be extremely imprudent to give the command of a country extending above a thousand miles along the coast, to a fanciful presumptuous enthusiast, a stranger to the affairs of the world, and unac∣quainted with the arts of government. Las Casas, far from being discouraged with a repulse, which he had reason to expect, had recourse once more to the Flemish favourites, who zealously patronized his scheme, merely because it had been rejected by the Spanish ministers. They prevailed with their master, who had lately been raised to the Imperial dignity, to refer the consideration of this measure to a select number of his privy-counsellors; and Las Casas having excepted against the members of the counsel of the Indies, as partial and interested, they were all excluded. The decision of men chosen by recommendation of the Flemings, was perfectly conformable to their sentiments. They warmly approved of Las Casas's plan; and gave orders for carrying it into execution, but restricted the territory allotted him to three hundred miles along the coast of Cumana, allowing him, how∣ever,

to extend it as far as he pleased towards the interior part of the country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gomara Hist. Gener. c. 77. Herrera, dec. 2. lib. iv. c. 3. Oviedo, lib. xix. c. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS determination did not pass uncensured. Almost every person who had been in the West Indies exclaimed against it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A solemn deliberation concerning the mode of treating the Indians</NOTE> and supported their opinion so confidently, and with such plausible rea∣sons, as made it adviseable to pause and to review the subject more deliberately. Charles himself, though accustomed, at this early period of his life, to adopt the sentiments of his ministers, with such submissive deference as did not promise that deci∣sive vigour of mind which distinguished his riper years, could not help suspecting that the eagerness with which the Flemings took part in every affair relating to America, flowed from some improper motive, and began to discover an inclination to examine in person into the state of the question concerning the character of the Americans, and the proper manner of treating them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 20.</NOTE> An opportunity of making this inquiry with great advantage soon occurred. Quevedo, the bishop of Darien, who had accompanied Pedrarias to the continent in the year one thousand five hundred and thirteen, hap∣pened to land at Barcelona, where the court then resided. It was quickly known, that his senti∣ments concerning the talents and disposition of the Indians differed from those of Las Casas; and Charles naturally concluded that by confronting two res∣pectable persons, who, during their residence in America, had full leisure to observe the manners of the people whom they pretended to describe, he might be able to discover which of them had formed his opinion with the greatest discernment and accuracy.</P>
<P>A day for this solemn audience was appointed.

The emperor appeared with extraordinary pomp, and took his seat on a throne in the great hall of the palace. His principal courtiers attended. Don Diego Columbus admiral of the Indies, was sum∣moned to be present. The bishop of Darien was called upon first to deliver his opinion. He, in a short discourse, lamented the fatal desolautin of America, by the extinction of so many of its in∣habitants; he acknowledged that this must be im∣puted, in some degree, to the excessive rigour and inconsiderate proceedings of the Spaniards; but declared, that all the people of the New World, whom he had seen either in the continent or in the islands, appeared to him to be a race of men marked out, by the inferiority of their talents, for servitude, and whom it would be impossible to instruct or improve, unless they were kept under the continual inspection of a master. Las Casas, at greater length, and with more fervour, defended his own system. He rejected with indignation the idea that any race of men was born to servitude, as irreligious and inhuman. He asserted, that the faculties of the Americans were not naturally despi∣cable, but unimproved; that they were capable of receiving instruction, in the principles of religion, as well as of acquiring the industry and arts which would qualify them for the various offices of social life; that the mildness and timidity of their nature rendered them so submissive and docile, that they might be led and formed with a gentle hand. He professed, that his intentions in proposing the scheme now under consideration were pure and dis∣interested; and though, from the accomplishment of his designs, inestimable benefits would result to the crown of Castile, he never had claimed, nor ever would receive, any recompence on that account.</P>
<P>CHARLES, after hearing both, and consulting with his ministers, did not think himself sufficiently

informed to establish any general arrangement with respect to the state of the Indians; but as he had perfect confidence in the integrity of Las Casas, and as even the bishop of Darien admitted his scheme to be of such importance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The scheme of Las Casas approved of.</NOTE> that a trial should be made of its effects, he issued a patent, granting him the district in Cumana formerly mentioned,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1520.</NOTE> with full power to establish a colony there accord∣ing to his own plan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. iv. c. 3, 4, 5.

<P>LAS CASAS pushed on the preparations for his voyage with his usual ardour.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His prepa∣rations for executing it.</NOTE> But either from his own inexperience in the conduct of affairs, or from the secret opposition of the Spanish nobility, who universally dreaded the success of an institution that might rob them of the industrious and useful hands which cultivated their estates, his progress in engag∣ing husbandmen and labourers was extremely slow, and he could not prevail on more than two hundred to accompany him to Cumana.</P>
<P>NOTHING, however, could damp his zeal.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Departs for America, and meets with for∣midable obstacles.</NOTE> With this slender train, hardly sufficient to take possession of such a large territory, and altogether unequal to any effectual attempt towards civilzing its inhabit∣ants, he set sail. The first place at which he touched was the island of Puerto Rico. There he received an account of a new obstacle to the execu∣tion of his scheme, more insuperable than any he had hitherto encountered. When he left America in the year one thousand five hundred and sixteen, the Spaniards had little intercourse with any part of the continent, except the countries adjacent to the gulf of Darien. But as every species of inter∣nal industry began to stagnate in Hispaniola, when, by the rapid decrease of the natives, the Spaniards were deprived of those hands with which they had
<PB N="266" REF="034476_0264_0FFDD6D775F625E0"/>
hitherto carried on their operations, this prompted them to try various expedients for supplying that loss. Considerable numbers of negroes were im∣ported; but, on account of their exorbitant price, many of the planters could not afford to purchase them. In order to procure slaves at an easier rate, some of the Spaniards in Hispaniola fitted out vessels to cruize along the coast of the continent. In places where they found themselves inferior in strength, they traded with the natives, and gave European toys in exchange for the plates of gold worn by them as ornaments; but, wherever they could surprise or overpower the Indians, they carried them off by force, and sold them as slaves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. ii. c. 3.</NOTE>. In those predatory excursions, such atrocious acts of violence and cruelty had been commited, that the Spanish name was held in detestation all over the continent. Whenever any ships appeared, the inhabitants either fled to the woods, or rushed down to the shore in arms, to r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pel those hated disturbers of their tranquillity. They forced some parties of the Spaniards to retreat with precipitation; they cut off others; and in the violence of their re∣sentment against the whole nation, they murdered two Dominican missionaries, whose zeal had prompt∣ed them to settle in the province of Cumana<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Oviedo Hist. lib. xix. c. 3.</NOTE>. This outrage against persons revered for their sanc∣tity, excited such indignation among the people of Hispaniola, who, notwithstanding all their licenti∣ous and cruel proceedings, were possessed with a wonderful zeal for religion, and a superstitious res∣pect for its ministers, that they determined to inflict exemplary punishment, not only upon the perpetra∣tors of that crime, but upon the whole race. With this view, they gave the command of five ships and three hundred men to Diego Ocampo, with orders to lay waste the country of Cumana with fire and
<PB N="267" REF="034476_0265_0FFDD6DB147D4CE0"/>
sword, and to transport all the inhabitants as slaves to Hispaniola. This armament Las Casas found at Puerto Rico, in its way to the continent; and as Ocampo refused to defer his voyage, he immedi∣ately perceived that it would be impossible to attempt the execution of his pacific plan in a country destined to be the seat of war and deso∣lation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ix. c. 8, 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to provide against the effects of this unfortunate incident,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Labours to surmount them.</NOTE> he set sail directly for St. Do∣mingo, leaving his followers cantoned out among the planters in Puerto Rico. From many concur∣ring causes, the reception which Las Casas met with in Hispaniola was very unfavourable. In his negociations for the relief of the Indians, he had censured the conduct of his countrymen settled there with such honest severity as rendered him uni∣versally odious to them. They considered their own ruin as the inevitable consequence of his suc∣cess. They were now elated with hope of receiving a large recruit of slaves from Cumana, which must be relinquished if Las Casas were assisted in settling his projected colony there. Figueroa, in conse∣quence of the instructions which he had received in Spain, had made an experiment concerning the ca∣pacity of the Indians, that was represented as decisive against the system of Las Casas. He collected in Hispaniola a good number of the natives, and set∣tled them in two villages, leaving them at perfect liberty, and with the uncontrolled direction of their own actions. But that people, accustomed to a mode of life extremely different from that which takes place wherever civilization has made any con∣siderable progress, were incapable of assuming new habits at once. Dejected with their own misfor∣tunes as well as those of their country, they exerted
<PB N="268" REF="034476_0266_0FFDD6DDA7FA8AF8"/>
so little industry in cultivating the ground, appeared so devoid of solicitude or foresight in providing for their own wants, and were such strangers to ar∣rangement in conducting their affairs, that the Spaniards pronounced them incapable of being formed to live like men in social life, and considered them as children, who should be kept under the perpetual tutelage of persons superior to themselves in wisdom and sagacity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. x. c. 5.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Final mis∣carriage of his scheme</NOTE>NOTWITHSTANDING all those circumstances which alienated the Spaniards in Hispaniola to whom Las Casas applied from himself and from his measures, he, by his activity and perseverance, by some concessions, and many threats, obtained at length a small body of troops to protect him and his colony at their first landing. But upon his re∣turn to Puerto Rico, he found that the diseases of the climate had been fatal to several of his people; and that others having got employment in that island, refused to follow him. With the handful that remained, he set sail and landed in Cumana. Ocampo had executed his commission in that pro∣vince with such barbarous rage, having massacred many of the inhabitants, sent others in chains to Hispaniola, and forced the rest to fly for shelter to the woods, that the people of a small colony, which he had planted at that place which he called <HI>Toledo,</HI> were ready to perish for want in a desolated coun∣try. There, however, Las Casas was obliged to fix his residence, though deserted both by the troops appointed to protect him, and by those under the command of Ocampo, who foresaw and dreaded the calamities to which he must be exposed in that wretched station. He made the best provision in his power for the safety and subsistence of his fol∣lowers; but as his utmost efforts availed little to∣wards
<PB N="269" REF="034476_0267_0FFDD6E044323418"/>
securing either the one or the other, he re∣turned to Hispaniola, in order to solicit more effectual aid for the preservation of men, who from confidence in him had ventured into a post of so much danger. Soon after his departure, the na∣tives, having discovered the feeble and defenceless state of the Spaniards, assembled secretly, attacked them with the fury natural to men exasperated by many injuries, cut off a great number, and com∣pelled the rest to f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in the greatest consternation to the island of Cubagua. The small colony settled there, on account of the pearl fishery, catching the panic with which their countrymen had been seized, abandoned the island, and not a Spaniard remained in any part of the continent, or adjacent islands, from the gulf of Paria to the borders of Darien. Asto∣nished at such a succession of disasters, Las Casas was ashamed to shew his face after this fatal termination of all his splendid schemes. He shut himself up in the convent of the Dominicans at St. Domingo, and soon after assumed the habit of that order<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. x. c. 5. dec. 3. lib. ii. c. 3, 4, 5.

<P>THOUGH the expulsion of the colony from Cu∣mana happened in the year one thousand five hun∣dred and twenty-one, I have chosen to trace the progress of Las Casas's negociations from their first rise to their final issue without interruption. His system was the object of long and attentive dis∣cussion; and though his efforts in behalf of the op∣pressed Americans, partly from his own rashness and imprudence, and partly from the malevolent opposition of his adversaries, were not attended with that success which he promised with too san∣guine confidence, great praise is due to his humane activity, which gave rise to various regulations that

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New disco∣veries to∣wards the week.</NOTE>DIEGO VELASQUEZ, who conquered Cuba in the year one thousand five hundred and eleven, still retained the government of that island, as the de∣puty of Don Diego Columbus, though he seldom acknowledged his superior, and aimed at rendering his own authority altogether independent<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> lib. i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9.</NOTE>. Under his prudent administration, Cuba became one of the most flourishing of the Spanish settlements. The fame of this allured thither many persons from the other colonies, in hopes of finding either some permanent establishment or some employment for their activity. As Cuba lay to the west of all the islands occupied by the Spaniards, and as the ocean, which stretches beyond it towards that quarter, had not hitherto been explored, these circumstances na∣turally invited the inhabitants to attempt new disco∣veries. An expedition for this purpose, in which acti∣vity and resolution might conduct to sudden wealth, was more suited to the genius of the age, than the patient industry requisite in clearing ground, and ma∣nufacturing sugar. Instigated by this spirit, several officers, who had served under Pedrarias in Darien, entered into an association to undertake a voyage of discovery. They persuaded Francisco Hernandez Cordova, an opulent planter in Cuba, and a man of distinguished courage, to join with them in the ad∣venture, and chose him to be their commander. Ve∣lasquez not only approved of the design, but assisted in carrying it on. As the veterans from Darien were extremely indigent, he and Cordova advanced mo∣ney for purchasing three small vessels, and furnishing them with every thing requisite either for traffic or
<PB N="271" REF="034476_0269_0FFDD6E597A0A138"/>
for war. A hundred and ten men embarked on board of them, and sailed from St. Jago de Cuba on the eighth of February, one thousand five hun∣dred and seventeen. By the advice of their chief pilot, Antonio Alaminos, who had served under the first admiral Columbus, they stood directly west, relying on the opinion of that great navigator, who uniformly maintained that a westerly course would lead to the most important discoveries.</P>
<P>ON the twenty-first day after their departure from St. Jago, they saw land, which proved to be <HI>Cape Catoche,</HI> the eastern point of that large pe∣ninsula projecting from the continent of America, which still retains its original name of <HI>Yucatan.</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Yucatan.</NOTE> As they approached the shore, sive canoes came off full of people decently clad in cotton garments; an astonishing spectacle to the Spaniards, who had found every other part of America possessed by naked savages. Cordova endeavoured by small presents to gain the good-will of these people. They, though amazed at the strange objects now presented for the first time to their view, invited the Spaniards to visit their habitations, with an ap∣pearance of cordiality. They landed accordingly, and as they advanced into the country, they ob∣served with new wonder some large houses built with stone. But they soon found that, if the people of Yucatan had made progress in improvement beyond their countrymen, they were likewise more artful and warlike. For though the cazique re∣ceived Cordova with many tokens of friendship, he had posted a considerable body of his subjects in ambush behind a thicket, who, upon a signal give<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by him, rushed out and attacked the Spaniards with great boldness, and some degree of martial order. At the first flight of their arrows, fifteen of the Spaniards were wounded; but the Indians were struck with such terror by the sudden explo∣sion
<PB N="272" REF="034476_0270_0FFDD6E726608620"/>
of the fire-arms, and so surprised at the exe∣cution done by them, by the cross-bows, and by the other weapons of their new enemies, that they fled precipitately. Cordova quitted a country where he had met with such a fierce reception, carrying off two prisoners, together with the orna∣ments of a small temple, which he plundered in his retreat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Campea∣chy.</NOTE>HE continued his course towards the west, with∣out losing sight of the coast, and on the sixteenth day arrived at Campeachy. There the natives re∣ceived them more hospitably; but the Spaniards were much surprised, that on all the extensive coast along which they had sailed, and which they ima∣gined to be a large island, they had not observed any river<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXVI.</NOTE>. As their water began to fail, they ad∣vanced, in hopes of finding a supply; and at length they discovered the mouth of a river at Poton∣chan, some leagues beyond Campeachy.</P>
<P>CORDOVA landed all his troops in order to pro∣tect the sailors while employed in filling the casks; but notwithstanding this precaution, the natives rushed down upon them with such fury, and in such numbers, that forty-seven of the Spaniards were killed upon the spot, and one man only of the whole body escaped unhurt. Their commander, though wounded in twelve different places, directed the retreat with presence of mind equal to the courage with which he had led them on in the engagement, and with much difficulty regained their ships. After this fatal repulse, nothing remained but to hasten back to Cuba with their shattered forces. In their passage thither they suffered the most ex∣quisite distress for want of water, that men wounded and sickly, shut up in small vessels, and exposed to the heat of the torrid zone, can be supposed to en∣dure. Some of them, sinking under these calami∣ties,

<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the disastrous conclusion of this expedition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Voyage of Grijalva.</NOTE> it contributed rather to animate than to damp a spirit of enterprise among the Spa∣niards. They had discovered an extensive country, situated at no great distance from Cuba, fertile in appearance, and possessed by a people far superior in improvement to any hitherto known in America. Though they had carried on little commercial in∣tercourse with the natives, they had brought off some ornaments of gold, not considerable in value, but of singular fabric. These circumstances, rela∣ted with the exaggeration natural to men desirous of heightening the merit of their own exploits, were more than sufficient to excite romantic hopes and expectations. Great numbers offered to engage in a new expedition. Velasquez, solicitous to dis∣tinguish himself by some service so meritorious as might entitle him to claim the government of Cuba independent of the admiral, not only encouraged their ardour, but at his own expence fitted out four ships for the voyage. Two hundred and forty volunteers, among whom were several persons of rank and fortune, embarked in this enterprise. The command of it was given to Juan de Grijalva, a young man of known merit and courage, with instructions to observe attentively the nature of the countries which he should discover, to barter for gold, and, if circumstances were inviting, to settle a colony in some proper station. He sailed from St.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1518.</NOTE> Jago de Cuba on the eighth of April, one thousand five hundred and eighteen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovers New Spain.</NOTE> The pilot Alaminos held the same course as in the former voyage; but

the violence of the currents carrying the ships to the south, the first land which they made was the island of <HI>Cozumel,</HI> to the east of Yucatan, As all the inhabitants fled to the woods and mountains at the approach of the Spaniards, they made no long stay there, and without any remarkable occurrence they reached Potonchan on the opposite side of the peninsula. The desire of avenging their country∣men who had been slain there, concurred with their ideas of good policy, in prompting them to land, that they might chastise the Indians of that district with such exemplary rigour, as would strike terror into all the people around them. But though they disembarked all their troops, and carried ashore some field pieces, the Indians fought with such courage, that the Spaniards gained the victory with difficulty, and were confirmed in their opinion that the inhabitants of this country would prove more formidable enemies than any they had met with in other parts of America. From Poton∣chan, they continued their voyage towards the west, keeping as near as possible to the shore, and casting anchor every evening, from dread of the dangerous accidents to which they might be exposed in an unknown sea. During the day, their eyes were turned continually towards land, with a mixture of surprise and wonder at the beauty of the country, as well as the novelty of the objects which they beheld. Many villages were scattered along the coast, in which they could distinguish houses of stone that appeared white and lofty at a distance. In the warmth of their admiration, they fancied these to be cities adorned with towers and pinnacles; and one of the soldiers happening to remark that this coun∣try resembled Spain in its appearance, Grijalva, with universal applause, called it <HI>New Spain,</HI> the name which still distinguishes this extensive and opulent province of the Spanish empire in Ame∣rica<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXVII.</NOTE>.
<PB N="275" REF="034476_0273_0FFDD6F05DC77190"/>
They landed in a river which the natives called <HI>Tabasco,</HI> and the fame of their victory at Po∣tonchan having reached this place, the cazique not only received them amicably,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 9. Tobasco.</NOTE> but bestowed pre∣sents upon them of such value, as confirmed the high ideas which the Spaniards had formed with respect to the wealth and fertility of the country. These ideas were raised still higher by what occurred at the place where they next touched. This was considerably to the west of Tobasco, in the province since known by the name of Guaxaca.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Guaxaca.</NOTE> There they were received with the respect paid to superior be∣ings. The people perfumed them as they landed, with incense of gum copal, and presented to them as offerings the choicest delicacies of their country. They were extremely fond of trading with their new visitants, and in six days the Spaniards obtained ornaments of gold, of curious workmanship, to the value of fifteen thousand pesos, in exchange for European toys of small price. The two prisoners whom Cordova had brought from Yucatan, had hitherto served as interpreters; but as they did not understand the language of this country, the Spa∣niards learned from the natives by signs, that they were subjects of a great monarch called Monte∣zuma, whose dominion extended over that and many other provinces. Leaving this place, with which he had so much reason to be pleased, Gri∣jalva continued his course towards the west.<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 29.</NOTE> He landed on a small island, which he named the Isle of Sacrifices, because there the Spaniards beheld, for the first time the horrid spectacle of human victims, which the barbarous superstition of the natives offered to their gods.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons for not leaving a colony there.</NOTE>SEVERAL of Grijalva's officers contended, that it was not enough to have discovered those delight∣ful regions, or to have performed, at their different landing-places, the empty ceremony of taking pos∣session of them for the crown of Castile, and that their glory was incomplete, unless they planted a colony in some proper station, which might not only secure the Spanish nation a footing in the country, but, with the reinforcements which they were certain of receiving, might gradually subject the whole to the dominion of their sovereign. But the squadron had now been above five months at sea; the greatest part of their provisions was ex∣hausted, and what remained of their stores so much corrupted by the heat of the climate, as to be al∣most unfit for use; they had lost some men by death; others were sickly; the country was crowded with people who seemed to be intelligent as well as brave; and they were under the government of one powerful monarch, who could bring them to act against their invaders with united force. To plant a colony under so many circumstances of dis∣advantage, appeared a scheme too perilous to be attempted. Grijalva, though possessed both of am∣bition and courage, was destitute of the superior talents capable of forming or executing such a great plan. He judged it more prudent to return to Cuba, having fulfilled the purpose of his voyage, and accomplished all that the armament which he commanded enabled him to perform. He returned

As soon as Alvarado reached Cu∣ba, Velasquez, transported with success so far be∣yond his most sanguine expectations, immediately dispatched a person of confidence to carry this im∣portant intelligence to Spain, to exhibit the rich productions of the countries which had been dis∣covered by his means, and to solicit such an in∣crease of authority as might enable and encourage him to attempt the conquest of them.

<HEAD>THE HISTORY OF <HI>AMERICA.</HI> BOOK IV.</HEAD>
<P>TWENTY-SIX years had elapsed since Colum∣bus conducted the people of Europe to the New World.<NOTE PLACE="marg">BOOK IV. What parts of Ameri∣ca were then known</NOTE> During that period the Spaniards had made great progress in exploring its various re∣gions. They had visited all the islands scattered in different clusters through that part of the ocean which flows in between North and South America. They had sailed along the eastern coast of the continent from the river De la Plata to the bottom of the Mexican gulf, and had found that it stretch∣ed without interruption through this vast portion of the globe. They had discovered the great Southern Ocean, which opened new prospects in that quar∣ter. They had acquired some knowledge of the coast of Florida, which led them to observe the continent as it extended in an opposite direction; and though they pushed their discoveries no farther towards the north, other nations had visited those parts which they neglected. The English, in a voyage, the motives and success of which shall be related in another part of this History, had sailed along the coast of America from Labrador to the confines of Florida; and the Portuguese, in quest

of a shorter passage to the East Indies, had ven∣tured into the northern seas, and viewed the same regions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. vi. c. 16.</NOTE>. Thus, at the period where I have chosen to take a view of the state of the New World, its extent was known almost from its northern extre∣mity to thirty-five degrees south of the equator. The countries which stretch from thence to the southern boundary of America, the great empire of Peru, and the interior state of the extensive dominions subject to the sovereigns of Mexico, were still undiscovered.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The vast extent of the New World.</NOTE>WHEN we contemplate the New World, the first circumstance that strikes us is its immense extent. It was not a small portion of the earth, so incon∣siderable that it might have escaped the observa∣tion or research of former ages, which Columbus discovered. He made known a new hemisphere, larger than either Europe, or Asia, or Africa, the three noted divisions of the ancient continent, and not much inferior in dimensions to a third part of the habitable globe.</P>
<P>AMERICA is remarkable not only for its magni∣tude, but for its position. It stretches from the northern polar circle to a high southern latititude, above fifteen hundred miles beyond the fartherest extremity of the old continent on that side of the line. A country of such extent passes through all the climates capable of becoming the habitation of man, and fit for yielding the various productions peculiar either to the temperate or to the torrid regions of the earth.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Grand ob∣jects it presents to view.</NOTE>NEXT to the extent of the New World, the grandeur of the objects which it presents to view is most apt to strike the eye of an observer. Nature seems here to have carried on her operations upon a larger scale, and with a bolder hand, and to have
<PB N="281" REF="034476_0279_0FFDD7004DF889C0"/>
distinguished the features of this country by a pe∣culiar magnificence. The mountains of America are much superior in height to those in the other divisions of the globe. Even the plain of Quito,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its moun∣tains.</NOTE> which may be considered as the base of the Andes, is elevated farther above the sea than the top of the Pyrenees. This stupendous ridge of the Andes, no less remarkable for extent than elevation, rises in different places more than one third above the Pike of Teneriffe, the highest land in the ancient hemisphere. The Andes may literally be said to hide their heads in the clouds; the storms often roll, and the thunder bursts below their summits, which, though exposed to the rays of the sun in the center of the torrid zone, are covered with everlasting snows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXVIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM these lofty mountains descend rivers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivers.</NOTE> proportionably large, with which the streams in the ancient continent are not to be compared, either for length of course, or the vast body of water which they roll towards the ocean. The Maragnon, the Orinoco, the Plata in South Ame∣rica; the Missisippi and St. Laurence in North America, flow in such spacious channels, that, long before they feel the influence of the tide, they resemble arms of the sea, rather than rivers of fresh water<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXIX.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE lakes of the New World are no less con∣spicuous for grandeur than its mountains and rivers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Lakes.</NOTE> There is nothing in other parts of the globe which resembles the prodigious chain of lakes in North America. They may properly be termed inland seas of fresh water; and even those of the second or third class in magnitude, are of larger circuit (the Caspian sea excepted) than the greatest lake of the ancient continent.</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="034476_0280_0FFDD702097D2748"/>THE New World is of a form extremely fa∣vourable to commercial intercourse. When a continent is formed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its form favourable to com∣merce.</NOTE> like Africa, of one vast solid mass, unbroken by arms of the sea penetrating into its interior parts, with few large rivers, and those at a considerable distance from each other, the greater part of it seems destined to remain for ever uncivilized, and to be debarred from any active or enlarged communication with the rest of mankind. When, like Europe, a continent is opened by inlets of the ocean of great extent, such as the Mediterranean and Baltic; or when, like Asia, its coast is broken by deep bays advancing far into the country, such as the Black Sea, the gulfs of Arabia, of Persia, of Bengal, of Siam, and of Leotang; when the surrounding seas are filled with large and fertile islands, and the conti∣nent itself watered with a variety of navigable rivers, those regions may be said to possess what∣ever can facilitate the progress of their inhabitants in commerce and improvement. In all these re∣spects America may bear a comparison with the other quarters of the globe. The gulf of Mexico, which flows in between North and South America, may be considered as a Mediterranean sea, which opens a maritime commerce with all the fertile countries by which it is encircled. The islands scattered in it are inferior only to those in the In∣dian Archipelago, in number, in magnitude, and in value. As we stretch along the northern divi∣sion of the American hemisphere, the Bay of Chesapeak presents a spacious inlet, which conducts the navigator far into the interior parts of provinces no less fertile than extensive; and if ever the progress of culture and population shall mitigate the extreme rigour of the climate in the more northren districts of America, Hudson's Bay may become a subservient to commercial intercourse in
<PB N="283" REF="034476_0281_0FFDD705B2C07650"/>
that quarter of the globe, as the Baltic is in Eu∣rope. The other great portion of the New World is encompassed on every side by the sea, except one narrow neck, which separates the Atlantic from the Pacific Ocean; and though it be not opened by spacious bays or arms of the sea, its interior parts are rendered accessible by a num∣ber of large rivers, fed by so many auxiliary streams, flowing in such various directions, that, almost without any aid from the hand of industry and art, an inland navigation may be carried on through all the provinces from the river De la Plata to the gulf of Paria. Nor is this bounty of Nature confined to the southern division of America; its northern continent abounds no less in rivers which are navigable almost to their sources, and by its immense chain of lakes provision is made for an inland communication, more extensive and commodious than in any quarter of the globe. The countries stretching from the gulf of Darien on one side, to that of California on the other, which form the chain that binds the two parts of the American continent together, are not destitute of peculiar advantages. Their coast on one side is washed by the Atlantic Ocean, on the other by the Pacific. Some of their rivers flow into the former, some into the latter, and secure to them all the commercial benefits that may result from a communication with both.</P>
<P>BUT what most distinguishes America from other parts of the earth,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tempera∣ture of its climate.</NOTE> is the peculiar temperature of its climate, and the different laws to which it is subject with respect to the distribution of heat and cold. We cannot determine with precision the portion of heat felt in any part of the globe, merely by measuring its distance from the equator. The climate of a country is affected, in some de∣gree, by its elevation above the sea, by the extent
<PB N="284" REF="034476_0282_0FFDD7084DDCDBD0"/>
of continent, by the nature of the soil, the height of adjacent mountains, and many other circum∣stances. The influence of these, however, is, from various causes, less considerable in the greater part of the ancient continent; and from knowing the position of any country there, we can pronounce with greater certainty, what will be the warmth of its climate, and the nature of its productions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Predomi∣nance of cold.</NOTE>THE maxims which are founded upon observa∣tion of our hemisphere will not apply to the other. In the New World, cold predominates. The ri∣gour of the frigid zone extends over half of those regions, which should be temperate by their posi∣tion. Countries where the grape and the fig should ripen, are buried under snow one half of the year; and lands situated in the same parallel with the most fertile and best cultivated provinces in Europe, are chilled with perpetual frosts, which almost destroy the power of vegetation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXX.</NOTE>. As we advance to those parts of America which lie in the same parallel with provinces of Asia and Africa, blessed with an uniform enjoyment of such genial warmth as is most friendly to life and to vegetation, the dominion of cold continues to be felt, and winter reigns, though, during a short period, with ex∣treme severity. If we proceed along the American continent into the torrid zone, we shall find the cold prevalent in the New World extending itself also to this region of the globe, and mitigating the excess of its fervour. While the negro on the coast of Africa is scorched with unremitting heat, the inhabitant of Peru breathes an air equally mild and temperate, and is perpetually shaded un∣der a canopy of grey clouds, which inrercepts the fierce beams of the sun, without obstructing his

friendly influence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Ulloa, tom. i. p. 453. Anson's Voyage, p. 184.</NOTE>. Along the eastern coast of America, the climate, though more similar to that of the torrid zone in other parts of the earth, is nevertheless considerably milder than in those coun∣tries of Asia and Africa which lie in the same latitude. If from the southern tropic we continue our progress to the extremity of the American continent, we meet with frozen seas, and countries horrid, barren, and scarcely habitable for cold, much sooner than in the north<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Anson's Voyage, p. 74; and Voyage de Quiros, chez Hist. de Gen. des Voyages, tom. xiv. p. 83. Richard Hist. Natur. de l'Air, ii. 305, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>VARIOUS causes combine in rendering the cli∣mate of America so extremely different from that of the ancient continent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of this.</NOTE> Though the utmost extent of America towards the north be not yet discovered, we know that it advances much nearer to the pole than either Europe or Asia. Both these have large seas to the north, which are open dur∣ing part of the year, and even when covered with ice, the wind that blows over them is less intensely cold than that which blows over land in the same high latitudes. But in America the land stretches from the river St. Laurence towards the pole, and spreads out immensely to the West. A chain of enormous mountains, covered with snow and ice, runs through all this dreary region. The wind, in passing over such an extent of high and frozen land, becomes so impregnated with cold, that it acquires a piercing keenness, which it retains in its progress through warmer climates, and is not entirely miti∣gated until it reach the gulf of Mexico. Over all the continent of North America, a north-westerly wind and excessive cold are synonymous terms. Even in the most sultry weather, the moment that the wind veers to that quarter, its penetrating in∣fluence
<PB N="286" REF="034476_0284_0FFDD70D94651D78"/>
is felt in a transition from heat to cold, no less violent than sudden. To this powerful cause we may ascribe the extraordinary dominion of cold, and its violent inroads into the southern provinces in that part of the globe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlevoix Hist. de Nov. Fr. iii. 165. Hist. generale Voyages, tom. xv. 215. &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OTHER causes, no less remarkable, diminish the active power of heat in those parts of the American continent which lie between the tropics. In all that portion of the globe, the wind blows in an invariable direction from east to west. As this wind holds its course across the ancient continent, it arrives at the countries which stretch along the western shores of Africa, inflamed with all the fiery particles which it hath collected from the sultry plains of Asia, and the burning sands in the African deserts. The coast of Africa is, accord∣ingly, the region of the earth which feels the most fervent heat, and is exposed to the unmitigated ardour of the torrid zone. But this same wind which brings such an accession of warmth to the countries lying between the river of Senegal and Cafraria, traverses the Atlantic Ocean, before it reaches the American shore. It is cooled in its passage over this vast body of water, and is felt as a refreshing gale along the coast of Brasil<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXXI.</NOTE>, and Guinea, rendering these countries, though among the warmest in America, temperate, when com∣pared with those which lie opposite to them in Africa<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXXII.</NOTE>. As this wind advances in its course across America, it meets with immense plains, covered with impenetrable forests, or occupied by large rivers, marshes, and stagnating waters, where it can recover no considerable degree of heat. At length it arrives at the Andes, which run from
<PB N="287" REF="034476_0285_0FFDD71028E446E8"/>
north to south through the whole continent. In passing over their elevated and frozen summits, it is so thoroughly cooled, that the greater part of the countries beyond them hardly feel the ardour to which they seem exposed by their situation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acosta Hist. Novi Orbis, lib. ii. c. 11. Buffon Hist. Naturelle, &amp;c. tom. ii. 512, &amp;c. ix. 107, &amp;c. Osborn's Collect. of Voyages, ii. p. 868,</NOTE>. In the other provinces of America, from Tierra Firmè westward to the Mexican empire, the heat of the climate is tempered, in some places, by the elevation of the land above the sea, in others, by their extraordinary humidity, and in all, by the enormous mountains scattered over this tract. The islands of America in the Torrid Zone are either small or mountainous, and are fanned alternately by refreshing sea and land breezes.</P>
<P>THE causes of the extraordinary cold towards the southern limits of America, and in the seas beyond it, cannot be ascertained in a manner equally satisfying. It was long supposed that a vast continent, distinguished by the name of <HI>Terra Australis Incognita,</HI> lay between the southern extre∣mity of America and the Antarctic pole. The same principles which account for the extraordinary degree of cold in the northern regions of America, were employed in order to explain that which is felt at Cape Horn and the adjacent countries. The immense extent of the southern continent, and the large rivers which it poured into the ocean, were mentioned and admitted by philosophers as causes sufficient to occasion the unusual sensation of cold, and the still more uncommon appearances of frozen seas in that region of the globe. But the imaginary continent to which such influence was ascribed, having been searched for in vain, and the space which it was supposed to occupy having been found to be an open sea, new conjectures must be
<PB N="288" REF="034476_0286_0FFDD712C0C15FE8"/>
formed with respect to the causes of a temperature of climate, so extremely different from that which we experience in countries removed at the same distance from the opposite pole<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXXIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Condition when first discovered.</NOTE>AFTER contemplating those permanent and cha∣racteristic qualities of the American continent, which arise from the peculiarity of its situation, and the disposition of its parts, the next object that merits attention is its condition when first disco∣vered, as far as that depended upon the industry and operations of man. The effects of human ingenuity and labour are more extensive and consi∣derable, than even our own vanity is apt at first to imagine. When we survey the face of the habi∣table globe, no small part of that fertility and beau∣ty which we ascribe to the hand of nature, is the work of man. His efforts, when continued through a succession of ages, change the appear∣ance and improve the qualities of the earth. As a great part of the ancient continent has long been occupied by nations far advanced in arts and industry, our eye, is accustomed to view the earth in that form which it assumes when rendered fit to be the residence of a numerous race of men, and to supply them with nourishment.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Rude and uncultiva∣ted.</NOTE>BUT in the New World, the state of mankind was ruder, and the aspect of nature extremely dif∣ferent. Throughout all its vast regions, there were only two monarchies remarkable for extent of territory, or distinguished by any progress in improvement. The rest of this continent was possessed by small independent tribes, destitute of arts and industry, and neither capable to correct the defects, nor desirous to meliorate the condition of that part of the earth allotted to them for their habitation. Countries, occupied by such people,
<PB N="289" REF="034476_0287_0FFDD71815AA0158"/>
were almost in the same state as if they had been without inhabitants. Immense forests covered a great part of the uncultivated earth; and as the hand of industry had not taught the rivers to run in a proper channel, or drained off the stagnat∣ing water, many of the most fertile plains were overflowed with inundations, or converted into marshes. In the southern provinces, where the warmth of the sun, the moisture of the climate, and the fertility of the soil, combine in calling forth the most vigorous powers of vegetation, the woods are so choked with its rank luxuriance, as to be almost impervious, and the surface of the ground is hid from the eye under a thick covering of shrubs and herbs and weeds. In this state of wild unassisted nature, a great part of the large provinces in South America, which extend from the bottom of the Andes to the sea, still remain. The European colonies have cleared and cultivated a few spots along the coast, but the original race of inhabitants, as rude and indolent as ever, have done nothing to open or improve a country, pos∣sessing almost every advantage of situation and climate. As we advance towards the northern provinces of America, Nature continues to wear the same uncultivated aspect, and in proportion as the rigour of the climate increases, appears more desolate and horrid. There the forests, though not encumbered with the same exuberance of ve∣getation, are of immense extent; prodigious marshes overspread the plains, and few marks appear of human activity in any attempt to culti∣vate or embellish the earth. No wonder that the colonies sent from Europe were astonished at their first entrance into the New World. It appeared to them waste, solitary, and uninviting. When the English began to settle in America, they termed the countries of which they took possession,

<HI>The Wilderness.</HI> Nothing but their eager expect∣ation of finding mines of gold, could have induced the Spaniards to penetrate through the woods and marshes of America, where, at every step, they observed the extreme difference between the uncultivated face of Nature, and that which it acquires under the forming hand of industry and art<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXXIV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Unwhole∣some.</NOTE>THE labour and operations of man not only improve and embellish the earth, but render it more wholesome and friendly to life. When any region lies neglected and destitute of cultivation, the air stagnates in the woods, putrid exhalations arise from the waters; the surface of the earth, loaded with rank vegetation, feels not the purify∣ing influence of the sun or of the wind; the ma∣lignity of the distempers natural to the climate increases, and new maladies no less noxious are engendered. Accordingly, all the provinces of America, when first discovered, were found to be remarkably unhealthy. This the Spaniards expe∣rienced in every expedition into the New World, whether destined for conquest or settlement.— Though by the natural constitution of their bodies, their habitual temperance, and the persevering vigour of their minds, they were as much formed as any people in Europe for active service in a sultry climate, they felt severely the fatal and per∣nicious qualities of those uncultivated regions through which they marched, or where they en∣deavoured to plant colonies. Great numbers were cut off by the unknown and violent diseases with which they were infected. Such as survived the destructive rage of those maladies, were not ex∣empted from the noxious influence of the climate. They returned to Europe, according to the de∣scription

<P>THE uncultivated state of the New World af∣fected not only the temperature of the air,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its animals.</NOTE> but the qualities of its productions. The principle of life seems to have been less active and vigorous there, than in the ancient continent. Notwith∣standing the vast extent of America, and the va∣riety of its climates, the different species of ani∣mals peculiar to it are much fewer in proportion, than those of the other hemisphere. In the islands, there were only four kinds of quadrupeds known, the largest of which did not exceed the size of a rabbit. On the continent, the variety was greater; and though the individuals of each kind could not fail of multiplying exceedingly, when almost un∣molested by men, who were neither so numerous, nor so united in society, as to be formidable ene∣mies to the animal creation, the number of distinct species must still be considered as extremely small. Of two hundred different kinds of animals spread over the face of the earth, only about one third existed in America, at the time of its discovery<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Buffon. Hist. Naturelle, tom. ix. p. 86.</NOTE>. Nature was not only less prolific in the New World, but she appears likewise to have been less vigorous in her productions. The animals originally belonging to this quarter of the globe appear to be of an inferior race, neither so robust nor so fierce, as those of the other continent. America gives birth to no creature of such bulk as to be compared with the elephant or rhinoceros,

Hence the number of birds common to both continents is much greater than that of quadrupeds, and even such as are peculiar to America nearly resemble those with which mankind were acquainted in si∣milar regions of the ancient hemisphere. The American birds of the torrid zone, like those of the same climate in Asia and Africa, are decked in plumage, which dazzle the eye with the beauty of its colours; but nature satisfied with clothing them in this gay dress, has denied most of them that melody of sound, and variety of notes, which catch and delight the ear. The birds of the tem∣perate climates there, in the same manner as in our continent, are less splendid in their appearance, but, in compensation for that defect, they have voices of greater compass, and more melodious.

the description of which belongs to those who write their particular history. In ge∣neral, we may observe, that the moisture and cold, which predominates so remarkably in all parts of America, must have great influence upon the nature of its soil; countries lying in the same parallel with those regions which never feel the extreme rigour of winter in the ancient continent, are frozen over in America during a great part of the year. Chilled by this intense cold, the ground never acquires warmth sufficient to ripen the fruits, which are found in the corresponding parts of the other con∣tinent. If we wish to rear in America the produc∣tions which abound in any particular district of the ancient world, we must advance several degrees nearer to the line than in the other hemisphere, as it requires such an increase of heat to counterba∣lance the natural frigidity of the soil and climate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXXVIII.</NOTE>. At the Cape of Good Hope, several of the plants, and fruits peculiar to the countries within the tro∣pics, are cultivated with success; whereas, at St. Augustine, in Florida, and Charles-Town, in South Carolina, though considerably nearer the line, they cannot be brought to thrive with equal certainty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXXIX.</NOTE>. But, if allowance be made for this diversity in the degree of heat, the soil of America is naturally as rich and fertile as in any part of the earth. As the country was thinly inhabited, and by a people of little industry, who had none of the domestic ani∣mals, which civilized nations rear in such vast num∣bers, the earth was not exhausted by their con∣sumption. The vegetable productions, to which the fertility of the soil gave birth, often remained untouched, and being suffered to corrupt on its surface, returned with increase into its bosom<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Buffon, Hist.

As trees and plants derive a great part of their nourishment from air and water, if they were not destroyed by man and other, animals, they would render to the earth more, perhaps, than they take from it, and feed rather than impoverish it. Thus the unoccupied soil of America may have gone on enriching for many ages.

Even among the most en∣lightened people, the period of authentic history is extremely short, and every thing prior to that is fabulous or obscure. It is not surprising, then, that the unlettered inhabitants of America, who have no solicitude about futurity, and little curiosity concerning what is past, should be altogether un∣acquainted with their own original. The people on the two opposite coasts of America, who occupy those countries in America which approach nearest to the ancient continent, are so remarkably rude, that it is altogether vain to search among them for such information as might discover the place from whence they came, or the ancestors of whom they are descended<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Venega's Hist. of California, i. 60.</NOTE>.

<P>WHEN the people of Europe unexpectedly dis∣covered a New World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Various theories.</NOTE> removed at a vast distance from every part of the ancient continent which was then known, and filled with inhabitants whose ap∣pearance and manners differed remarkably from the rest of the human species, the question concerning their original became naturally an object of curio∣sity and attention. The theories and speculations of ingenious men with respect to this subject, would flll many volumes; but are often so wild and chimerical, that I should offer an insult to the un∣derstanding of my readers, if I attempted either minutely to enumerate or to refute them. Some have presumptuously imagined, that the people of America were not the offspring of the same com∣mon parent with the rest of mankind, but that they
<PB N="298" REF="034476_0296_0FFDD72D10D45980"/>
formed a separate race of men, distinguishable by peculiar features in the constitution of their bodies, as well as in the characteristic qualities of their minds. Others contend, that they are descended from some remnant of the Antediluvian inhabitants of the earth, who survived the deluge, which swept away the greatest part of the human species in the days of Noah; and preposterously suppose rude, uncivilized tribes, scattered over an uncultivated continent, to be the most ancient race of people on the earth. There is hardly any nation from the north to the south pole, to which some antiquary, in the extravagance of conjecture, has not ascribed the honour of peopling America. The Jews, the Canaanites, the Phoenicians, the Carthaginians, the Greeks, the Scythians in ancient times, are sup∣posed to have settled in this western world. The Chinese, the Swedes, the Norwegions, the Welsh, the Spaniards, are said to have sent colonies thither in later ages, at different periods, and on various occasions. Zealous advocates stand forth to sup∣port the respective claims of those people; and though they rest upon no better foundation than the casual resemblance of some customs, or the supposed affinity between a few words in their dif∣ferent languages, much erudition and more zeal have been employed, to little purpose, in defence of the opposite systems. Those regions of conjec∣ture and controversy belong not to the historian. His is a more limited province, confined to what is established by certain or highly probable evi∣dence. Beyond this I shall not venture, in offer∣ing a few observations, which may contribute to throw some light upon this curious and much agi∣tated question.</P>

united to the ancient continent, and dis∣joined from it by the shock of an earthquake, or the irruption of a deluge. Others have imagined, that some vessel being sorced from its course by the violence of a westerly wind, might be driven by accident towards the American coast, and have given a beginning to population in that desolate continent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Parson's remains of Japhet, p. 240.

But with respect to all those systems, it is in vain either to reason or inquire, because it is impossible to come to any decision.

<P N="2">2. NOTHING can be more frivolous or uncertain than the attempts to discover the original of the Americans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">or on re∣semblance of man∣ners.</NOTE> merely by tracing the resemblance between their manners and those of any particular people in the ancient continent. If we suppose two tribes, though placed in the most remote regions of the globe, to live in a climate nearly of the same temperature, to be in the same state of society, and to resemble each other in the degree of their im∣provement, they must feel the same wants, and exert the same endeavours to supply them. The same objects will allure, the same passions will ani∣mate them, and the same ideas and sentiments will arise in their minds. The character and occupa∣tions of the hunter in America must be little dif∣ferent from those of an Asiatic, who depends for subsistence on the chace. A tribe of savages on the banks of the Danube must nearly resemble one upon the plains washed by the Missisippi. Instead
<PB N="300" REF="034476_0298_0FFDD74F6EA12240"/>
then of presuming from this similarity, that there is an affinity between them, we should only con∣clude, that the disposition and manners of men are formed by their situation, and arise from the state of society in which they live. The moment that be∣gins to vary, the character of a people must change. In proportion as it advances in improvement, their manners refine, their powers and talents are called forth. In every part of the earth the progress of man hath been nearly the same, and we can trace him in his career from the rude simplicity of savage life, until he attains the industry, the arts, and the elegance of polished society. There is nothing wonderful then in the similitude between the Ame∣ricans and the barbarous nations of our continent. Had Lafitau, Garcia, and many other authors, at∣tended to this, they would not have perplexed a subject which they pretend to illustrate, by their fruitless endeavours to establish an affinity between various races of people in the old and new conti∣nents, upon no other evidence than such a resem∣blance in their manners as necessarily arises from the similarity of their condition. There are, it is true, among every people, some customs, which, as they do not flow from any natural want or desire peculiar to their situation, may be denominated usages of arbitrary institution. If between two na∣tions settled in remote parts of the earth, a perfect agreement with respect to any of these should be discovered, one might be led to suspect that they were connected by some affinity. If, for example, a nation were found in America that consecrated the seventh day to religious worship and rest, we might justly suppose that it had derived its know∣ledge of this usage, which is of arbitrary institution, from the Jews. But, if it were discovered that another nation celebrated the first appearance of every new moon with extraordinary demonstrations
<PB N="301" REF="034476_0299_0FFDD75207D1FFB8"/>
of joy, we should not be entitled to conclude that the observation of this monthly festival was bor∣rowed from the Jews, but ought to consider it merely as the expression of that joy which is na∣tural to man on the return of the planet which guides and cheers him in the night. The in∣stances of customs, merely arbitrary, common to the inhabitants of both hemispheres, are, indeed, so few and so equivocal, that no theory concerning the population of the New World ought to be founded upon them.</P>
<P N="3">3. THE theories which have been formed with respect to the original of the Americans,<NOTE PLACE="marg">or of reli∣g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ous rites.</NOTE> from ob∣servation of their religious rites and practices, are no less fanciful, and destitute of solid foundation. When the religious opinions of any people are neither the result of rational inquiry, nor derived from the instructions of revelation, they must needs be wild and extravagant. Barbarous nations are incapable of the former, and have not been blessed with the advantages arising from the latter. Still, however, the human mind, even where its opera∣tions appear most wild and capricious, holds a course so regular, that in every age and country the dominion of particular passions will be attended with similar effects. The savage of Europe or America, when filled with superstitious dread of invisible beings, or with inquisitive solicitude to penetrate into the events of futurity, trembles alike with fear, or glows with impatience. He has re∣course to rites and practices of the same kind, in order to avert the vengeance which he supposes to be impending over him, or to divine the secret which is the object of his curiosity. Accordingly, the ritual of superstition, in one continent, seems, in many particulars, to be a transcript of that esta∣blished in the other, and both authorise similar in∣stitutions, sometimes so frivolous as to excite pity,
<PB N="302" REF="034476_0300_0FFDD753A5FACB28"/>
sometimes so bloody and barbarous as to create horror. But without supposing any consanguinity between such distant nations, or imagining that their religious ceremonies were conveyed by tradition from the one to the other, we may ascribe this uniformity, which in many instances seems very amazing, to the natural operation of superstition and enthusiasm upon the weakest of the human mind.</P>
<P N="4"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Not peo∣p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d by any nation highly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ill<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</NOTE>4. WE may lay it down as a certain principle in this enquiry, that America was not peopled by any nation of the ancient continent, which had made considerable progress in civilization. The inhabi∣tants of the New World were in a state of society so extremely rude, as to be unacquainted with those arts which are the first essays of human ingenuity in its advance towards improvement. Even the most cultivated n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ions of America were strangers to many of those simple inventions, which were almost obeyed with society in other parts of the world, and were known in the earliest periods of civil life with which we have any ac∣quaintance. From this it is manifest, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the tribes which originally migrated from America, came off from nations which must have been no less bar∣barous than their posterity, at the time when they were first discovered by the Europeans. For, al∣though the elegant and refined arts may decline or perish, amidst the violent shocks of those revolu∣tions and disasters to which nations are exposed, the necessary arts of life, when once they have been introduced among any people, are never lost. None of the vicissitudes in human affairs affect these, and they continue to be practised as long as the race of men exists. If ever the use of iron had been known to the savages of America, or to their progenitors, if ever they had employed a plough, a loom, or a forge, the utility of those in∣ventions.
<PB N="303" REF="034476_0301_0FFDD7578E2E0910"/>
would have preserved them, and it is im∣possible that they should have been abandoned or forgotten. We may conclude then, that the Ame∣ricans sprung from some people, who were them∣selves in such an early and unimproved stage of society, as to be unacquainted with all those necessary arts, which continued to be unknown among their posterity, when first visited by the Spaniards.</P>
<P N="5">5. IT appears no less evident that America was not peopled by any colony from the more southern nations of the ancient continent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">nor from the south∣ern regions of our con∣tinent.</NOTE> None of the rude tribes settled in that part of our hemisphere can be supposed to have visited a country so remote. They possessed neither enterprise, nor ingenuity, nor power, that could prompt them to undertake, or enable them to perform, such a distant voyage. That the more civilized nations in Asia or Africa are not the progenitors of the Americans is mani∣fest, not only from the observations which I have already made concerning their ignorance of the most simple and necessary arts, but from an additional circumstance. Whenever any people have expe∣rienced the advantages which men enjoy, by their dominion over the inferior animals, they can nei∣ther subsist without the nourishment which these afford, nor carry on any considerable operation in∣dependent of their ministry and labour. Accord∣ingly, the first care of the Spaniards, when they set∣tled in America, was to stock it with all the domestic animals of Europe; and if, prior to them, the Ty∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ians, the Carthaginians, the Chinese, or any other polished people, had taken possession of that conti∣nent, we should have found there the animals pe∣culiar to those regions of the globe where they were originally sea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. In all America, however, there is not one animal, tame or wild, which pro∣perly belongs to the warm, or even the more tem∣perate countries of the adjacent continent. The
<PB N="304" REF="034476_0302_0FFDD7591EAD87E8"/>
camel, the dromedary, the horse, the cow, were as much unknown in America, as the elephant or the lion. From which it is obvious, that the people who first settled in the western world did not issue from the countries where those animals abound, and where men, from having been long accustomed to their aid, would naturally consider it, not only as beneficial, but as indispensably necessary to the im∣provement, and even the preservation, of civil so∣ciety.</P>
<P N="6"><NOTE PLACE="marg">The two continents seem to ap∣proach nearest to each other towards the north.</NOTE>6. From considering the animals with which America is stored, we may conclude that the nearest point of contact between, the old and new conti∣nents is towards the northern extremity of both, and that there the communication was opened, and the intercourse carried on between them. All the extensive countries in America which lie within the tropics, or approach near to them, are filled with indigenous animals of various kinds, entirely dif∣ferent from those in the corresponding regions of the ancient continent. But the northern provinces of the New World abound with many of the wild animals which are common in such parts of our hemisphere as lie in a similar situation.

<P N="7"><NOTE PLACE="marg">This ascer∣tained by discovery.</NOTE>7. The actual vicinity of the two continents is so clearly established by modern discoveries, that the chief difficulty with respect to the peopling of America is removed. While those immense re∣gions,
<PB N="305" REF="034476_0303_0FFDD75BC24F7610"/>
which stretch eastward from the river Oby to the sea of Kamchatka were unknown, or imper∣fectly explored, the north-east extremities of our hemisphere were supposed to be so far distant from any part of the New World, that it was not easy to conceive how any communication should have been carried on between them. But the Russians, hav∣ing subjected the western part of Siberia to their empire, gradually extended their knowledge of that vast country, by advancing towards the east into unknown provinces. These were discovered by hunters in their excursions after game, or by sol∣diers employed in levying the taxes, and the court of Moscow estimated the importance of those coun∣tries only by the small addition which they made to its revenue. At length Peter the Great ascended the Russian throne. His enlightened, comprehen∣sive mind, intent upon every circumstance that could aggrandize his empire, or render his reign illustrious, discerned consequences of those disco∣veries, which had escaped the observation of his ignorant predecessors. He perceived, that in pro∣portion as the regions of Asia extended towards the east, they must approach nearer to America; that the communication between the two continents, which had long been searched for in vain, would probably be found in this quarter, and that by open∣ing it, some part of the wealth and commerce of the western world might be made to flow into his dominions by a new channel. Such an object suited a genius that delighted in grand schemes. Peter drew up instructions with his own hand for prose∣cuting this design, and gave orders for carrying it into execution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Muller Voyages et Decouvertes par les Russes, tom. i. p. 4, 5. 141.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HIS successors adopted his ideas, and pursued his
<PB N="306" REF="034476_0304_0FFDD75FA3147030"/>
plan. The officers whom the Russian court em∣ployed in this service, had to struggle with so many difficulties, that their progress was extremely slow. Encouraged by some faint traditions among the people of Siberia, concerning a successful voyage in the year one thousand six hundred and forty-eight, round the north-east promontory of Asia, they attempted to follow the same course. Vessels were fitted out, with this view, at different times, from the rivers Lena and Kolyma; but in a frozen ocean, which nature seems not to have destined for navigation, they were exposed to many disasters, without being able to accomplish their purpose. No vessel fitted out by the Russian court ever dou∣bled this formidable Cape<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLI.</NOTE>; we are indebted for what is known of those extreme regions of Asia, to the discoveries made in excursions by land. In all those provinces an opinion prevails, that there are countries of great extent and fertility, which lie at no considerable distance from their own coasts. These the Russians imagined to be part of Ame∣rica; and several circumstances concurred not only in confirming them in this belief, but in persuading them that some portion of that continent could not be very remote. Trees of various kinds, unknown in those naked regions of Asia, are driven upon the coast by an easterly wind. By the same wind, float∣ing ice is brought thither in a few days; slights of birds arrive annually from the same quarter; and a tradition obtains among the inhabitants, of an in∣tercourse formerly carried on with some countries situated to the east.</P>
<P>AFTER weighing all these particulars, and com∣paring the position of the countries in Asia which had been discovered, with such parts in the north-west of America as were already known, the Russian
<PB N="307" REF="034476_0305_0FFDD7613684C1B0"/>
court formed a plan, which would have hardly oc∣curred to a nation less accustomed to engage in ardu∣ous undertakings, and to contend with great difficul∣ties. Orders were issued to build two vessels at the small village of Ochotz, situated on the sea of Kam∣chatka, to sail on a voyage of discovery. Though that dreary uncultivated region furnished nothing that could be of use in constructing them, but some larch trees; though not only the iron, the cordage, the sails, and all the numerous articles requisite for their equipment, but the provisions for victualling them were to be carried through the immense de∣serts of Siberia, down rivers of difficult navigation, and along roads almost impassable, the mandate of the sovereign, and the perseverance of the people, at last surmounted every obstacle.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1741. June 4.</NOTE> Two vessels were finished, and, under the command of the captains Behring and Tschirikow, sailed from Kamchatka, in quest of the New World, in a quarter where it had never been approached. They shaped their course towards the east; and though a storm soon separa∣ted the vessels, which never rejoined, and many dis∣asters befel them, the expectations from the voyage were not altogether frustrated. Each of the com∣manders discovered land, which to them appeared to be part of the American continent; and, according to their observations, it seems to be situated within a few degrees of the north-west coast of California. Each set some of his people ashore; but in one place the inhabitants fled as the Russians approached; in another, they carried off those who landed, and de∣stroyed their boats. The violence of the weather, and the distress of their crews, obliged both cap∣tains to quit this inhospitable coast. In their re∣turn they touched at several islands, which stretch in a chain from east to west between the country which they had discovered and the coast of Asia. They had some intercourse with the natives, who
<PB N="308" REF="034476_0306_0FFDD763D39E79E8"/>
seemed to them to resemble the North Americans. They presented to the Russians the <HI>calumet,</HI> or pipe of peace, which is a symbol of friendship universal among the people of North America, and an usage of arbitrary institution, peculiar to them.</P>
<P>THOUGH the islands of this New Archipelago have been frequented since that time by the Rus∣sian hunters, the court of St. Petersburgh, during a period of more than forty years, seems to have relinquished every thought of prosecuting discove∣ries in that quarter. But in the year one thousand seven hundred and sixty-eight, it was unexpectedly resumed. The Sovereign, who had been lately seated on the throne of Peter the Great, possessed the genius and talents of her illustrious predecessor. During the operations of the most arduous and extensive war in which the Russian empire was ever engaged, she formed schemes and executed undertakings, to which more limited abilities would have been incapable of attending but amidst the liesure of pacific times. A new voyage of discovery from the eastern extremity of Asia was planned, and captain Krenitzin and lieutenant Levasheff were appointed to command the two vessels fitted out for that purpose. In their voyage outward they held nearly the same course with the former navigators, they touched at the same islands, observed their situation and productions more carefully, and dis∣covered several new islands, with which Behring and Tschirikow had not fallen in. Though they did not proceed so far to the east as to revisit the country which Behring and Tschirikow supposed to be part of the American continent, yet, by return∣ing in a course considerably to the north of theirs, they corrected some capital mistakes into which their predecessors had fallen, and have contributed to facilitate the progress of future navigators in those seas<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="309" REF="034476_0307_0FFDD7676C6CE4F0"/>THUS the possibility of a communication between the continents in this quarter rests no longer upon mere conjecture, but is established by undoubted evidence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Muller's Voyages, tom. i. 248, &amp;c. 267.276.</NOTE>. Some tribe, or some families of wan∣dering Tartars, from the restless spirit peculiar to their race, might migrate to the nearest islands, and, rude as their knowledge of navigation was, might, by passing from one to the other, reach at length the coast of America, and give a beginning to po∣pulation in that continent. The distance between the Marian or Ladrone islands and the nearest land in Asia, is greater than that between the part of America which the Russians discovered, and the coast of Kamchatka; and yet the inhabitants of those islands are manifestly of Asiatic extract. If, notwithstanding their remote situation, we admit that the Marian islands were peopled from our con∣tinent, distance alone is no reason why we should hesitate about admitting that the Americans may derive their original from the same source. It is probable that future navigators in those seas, by steering farther to the north, may find that the con∣tinent of America approaches still nearer to Asia. According to the information of the barbarous people who inhabit the country about the north-east promontory of Asia, there lies, off the coast, a small island, to which they fall in less than a day. From that, they can descry a large continent, which, according to their description, is covered with fo∣rests, and possessed by people whose language they do not understand<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Muller's Voyages et Decouv. i. 166.</NOTE>.

D 1784.</NOTE> well acquainted with the language of Greenland, having visited the country of the Esquimaux, found, to his astonish∣ment, that they spoke the same language with the Greenlanders, that they were in every respect the same people, and he was accordingly received and entertained by them as a friend and a brother<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Brantz' Hist. of Greenl. p. 261, 262.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BY these decisive facts, not only the consangui∣nity of the Esquimaux and Greenlanders is esta∣blished, but the possibility of peopling America from the north of Europe is demonstrated. If the Nor∣wegians, in a barbarous age, when science had not begun to dawn in the north of Europe, possessed such naval skill as to open a communication with Greenland, their ancestors, as much addicted to roving by sea, as the Tartars are to wandering by land, might, at some more remote period, accom∣plish the same voyage, and settle a colony there, whose descendants might, in progress of time, mi∣grate into America. But if, instead of venturing to sail directly from their own coast to Greenland, we suppose that the Norwegians held a more cau∣tious course, and advanced from S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>etland to the Feroe Islands, and from them to Iceland, in all which they had planted colonies, their progress may have been so gradual, that this navigation can∣not be considered as either longer or more hazar∣dous, than those voyages which that hardy and en∣terprising race of men is known to have performed in every age.</P>

north-east of Asia, there seems to be good reason for supposing that the progenitors of all the Ame∣rican nations, from Cape Horn to the southern confines of Labrador, migrated from the latter ra∣ther than the former. The Esquimaux are the only people in America, who, in their aspect or character, bear any resemblance to the northern Europeans. They are manifestly a race of men, distinct from all the nations of the American con∣tinent, in language, in disposition, and in habits of life. Their original then, may warrantably be traced up to that source, which I have pointed out. But, among all the other inhabitants of America, there is such a striking similitude in the form of their bodies, and the qualities of their minds, that, not∣withstanding the diversities occasioned by the influ∣ence of climate, or unequal progress in improve∣ment, we must pronounce them to be descended from one source. There may be a variety in the shades, but we can every where trace the same ori∣ginal colour. Each tribe has something peculiar which distinguishes it, but in all of them we discern certain features common to the whole race. It is remarkable, that in every peculiarity, whether in their persons or dispositions, which characterise the Americans, they have some resemblance to the rude tribes scattered over the north-east of Asia, but almost none to the nations settled in the north∣ern extremities of Europe. We may, therefore, refer them to the former origin, and conclude that their Asiatic progenitors, having settled in those parts of America, where the Russians have disco∣vered the proximity of the two continents, spread gradually over its various regions. This account of the progress of population in America, coincides with the traditions of the Mexicans concerning their own origin, which, imperfect as they are, were preserved with more accuracy, and merit greater

credit, than those of any people in the New World. According to them, their ancestors came from a remote country, situated to the north-west of Mexi∣co. The Mexicans point out their various stations as they advanced from this, into the interior pro∣vinces, and it is precisely the same route which they must have held, if they had been emigrants from Asia. The Mexicans, in describing the appear∣ance of their progenitors, their manners and habits of life at that period, exactly delineate those of the rude Tartars, from whom I suppose them to have sprung<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acosta Hist.

<P>THE condition and character of the American nations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Condition and charac∣ter of the American<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> at the time when they became known to the Europeans, deserve more attentive considera∣tion, than the inquiry concerning their original. The latter is merely an object of curiosity, the former is one of the most important as well as in∣structive researches which can occupy the philoso∣pher or historian. In order to complete the history of the human mind, and attain to a perfect know∣ledge of its nature and operations, we must con∣template man in all those various situations wherein
<PB N="314" REF="034476_0312_0FFDD77482809060"/>
he has been placed. We must follow him in his progress through the different stages of society, as he gradually advances from the infant state of civil life towards its maturity and decline. We must observe, at each period, how the faculties of his understanding unfold, we must attend to the efforts of his active powers, watch the various movements of desire and affection, as they rise in his breast, and mark whether they tend, and with what ardour they are exerted. The philosophers and historians of ancient Greece and Rome, our guides in this as well as every other disquisition, had only a limited view of this subject, as they had hardly any oppor∣tunity of surveying man in his rudest and most early state. In all those regions of the earth with which they were well acquainted, civil society had made considerable advances, and nations had finish∣ed a good part of their career before they began to observe them. The Scythians and Germans, the rudest people of whom any ancient author has transmitted to us an authentic account, possessed flocks and herds, had acquired property of various kinds, and, when compared with mankind in their primitive state, may be reckoned to have attained to a great degree of civilization.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>BUT the discovery of the New World enlarged the sphere of contemplation, and presented nations to our view, in stages of their progress, much less advanced than those wherein they have been ob∣served in our continent. In America, man ap∣pears under the rudest form in which we can con∣ceive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to subsist. We behold communities just beginning to unite, and may examine the senti∣ments and actions of human beings in the infancy of social life, while they feel but imperfectly the force of its ties, and have scarcely relinquished their native liberty. That state of primaeval sim∣plicity, which was known in our continent only by
<PB N="315" REF="034476_0313_0FFDD77736B93B48"/>
the fanciful description of poets, really existed in the other. The greater part of its inhabitants were strangers to industry and labour, ignorant of arts, imperfectly acquainted with the nature of property, and enjoying almost without restriction or controul the blessings which flowed spontaneously from the bounty of nature. There were only two nations in this vast continent which had emerged from this rude state, and had made any considerable progress in acquiring the ideas, and adopting the institutions, which belong to polished societies. Their govern∣ment and manners will fall naturally under our re∣view in relating the discovery and conquest of the Mexican and Peruvian empires; and we shall have there an opportunity of contemplating the Ameri∣cans in the state of highest improvement to which they ever attained.</P>
<P>AT present,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This in∣quity con∣fined to the rudest tribes.</NOTE> our attention and researches shall be turned to the small independent tribes which occupied every other part of America. Among these, though with some diversity in their charac∣ter, their manners, and institutions, the state of society was nearly similar, and so extremely rude, that the denomination of Savage may be applied to them all. In a general history of America, it would be highly improper to describe the condition of each petty community, or to investigate every minute circumstance which contributes to form the character of its members. Such an inquiry would lead to details of immeasurable and tiresome extent. The qualities belonging to the people of all the different tribes have such a near resemblance, that they may be painted with the same features. Where any circumstances seem to constitute a di∣versity in their character and manners worthy of attention, it will be sufficient to point these out as they occur, and to inquire into the cause of such peculiarities.</P>
<P><PB N="316" REF="034476_0314_0FFDD778CBFB2F38"/>IT is extremely difficult to procure satisfying and authentic information concerning nations while they remain uncivilized.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficulty of obtain∣ing infor∣mation,</NOTE> To discover their true charac∣ter under this rude form, and to select the features by which they are distinguished, requires an ob∣server possessed of no less impartiality than discern∣ment. For, in every stage of society, the faculties, the sentiments and desires of men are so accommo∣dated to their own state, that they become standards of excellence to themselves, they affix the idea of perfection and happiness to those attainments which resemble their own, and wherever the objects and enjoyments to which they have been accustomed are wanting, confidently pronounce a people to be barbarous and miserable. Hence the mutual con∣tempt with which the members of communities, unequal in their degrees of improvement, regard each other. Polished nations, conscious of the advantages which they derive from their knowledge and arts, are apt to view rude nations with peculiar scorn, and, in the pride of superiority, will hardly allow either their occupations, their feelings, or their pleasures, to be worthy of men. It has sel∣dom been the lot of communities, in their early and unpolished state, to fall under the observation of persons endowed with force of mind superior to vulgar prejudices, and capable of contemplating man, under whatever aspect he appears, with a candid and discerning eye.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">From the incapacity of the first observers,</NOTE>THE Spaniards, who first visited America, and who had opportunity of beholding its various tribes while entire and unsubdued, and before any change had been made in their ideas or manners by inter∣course with a race of men much advanced beyond them in improvement, were far from possessing the qualities requisite for observing the striking spec∣tacle presented to their view. Neither the age in which they lived, nor the nation to which they be∣longed,
<PB N="317" REF="034476_0315_0FFDD77C67489848"/>
had made such progress in true science, as inspires enlarged and liberal sentiments. The con∣querors of the New World were mostly illiterate adventurers, destitute of all the ideas which should have directed them in contemplating objects, so extremely different from those with which they were acquainted. Surrounded continually with danger, or struggling with hardships, they had little leisure, and less capacity, for any speculative inquiry. Eager to take possession of a country of such extent and opulence, and happy in finding it occupied by inhabitants so incapable to defend it, they hastily pronounced them to be a wretched order of men, formed merely for servitude; and were more employed in computing the profits of their labour, than in inquiring into the operations of their minds, or the reasons of their customs and institutions. The persons who penetrated at sub∣sequent periods into the interior provinces, to which the knowledge and devastations of the first conquerors did not reach, were generally of a simi∣lar character; brave and enterprising in an high degree, but so uninformed as to be little qualified either for observing or describing what they beheld.</P>
<P>NOT only the incapacity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and their prejudices;</NOTE> but the prejudices of the Spaniards, render their accounts of the people of America extremely defective. Soon after they planted colonies in their new conquests, a difference in opinion arose with respect to the treatment of the natives. One party, solicitous to render their ser∣vitude perpetual, represented them as a brutish, ob∣stinate race, incapable either of acquiring religious knowledge, or of being trained to the functions of social life. The other, full of pious concern for their conversion, contended that, though rude and ignorant, they were gentle, affectionate, docile, and by proper instructions and regulations might be formed gradually into good Christians and useful

citizens. This controversy, as I have already re∣lated, was carried on with all the warmth which is natural, when attention to interest on the one hand, and religious zeal on the other, animate the dis∣putants. Most of the laity espoused the former opinion; all the ecclesiastics were advocates for the latter; and we shall uniformly find that, accord∣ingly as an author belonged to either of these par∣ties, he is apt to magnify the virtues or aggravate the defects of the Americans far beyond truth. Those repugnant accounts increase the difficulty of attaining a perfect knowledge of their character, and render it necessary to peruse all the descrip∣tions of them by Spanish writers with distrust, and to receive their information with some grains of allowance.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and from the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stems of philo∣sophers.</NOTE>ALMOST two centuries elapsed after the disco∣very of America, before the manners of its inhabi∣tants attracted, in any considerable degree, the at∣tention of philosophers. At length, they disco∣vered that the contemplation of the condition and character of the Americans in their original state, tended to complete our knowledge of the human species, might enable us to fill up a considerable chasm in the history of its progress, and lead to spe∣culations no less curious than important. They entered upon this new field of study with great ardour; but, instead of throwing light upon the subject, they have contributed, in some degree, to involve it in additional obscurity. Too impatient to inquire, they hastened to decide; and began to erect systems, when they should have been search∣ing for facts on which to establish their foundations. Struck with the appearance of degeneracy in the human species throughout the New World, and astonished at beholding a vast continent occupied by a naked, feeble, and ignorant race of men, some authors of great name have maintained, that
<PB N="319" REF="034476_0317_0FFDD780C205F1C0"/>
this part of the globe had but lately emerged from the sea, and become fit for the residence of man, that every thing in it bore marks of a recent origi∣nal; and that its inhabitants, lately called into ex∣istence, and still at the beginning of their career, were unworthy to be compared with the people of a more ancient and improved continent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. de Buffon Hist. Nat. iii. 484, &amp;c. ix. 103.114.</NOTE>. Others have imagined, that, under the influence of an un∣kindly climate, which checks and enervates the principle of life, man never attained in America the perfection which belongs to his nature, but remained an animal of an inferior order, defective in the vigour of his bodily frame, and destitute of sensibility, as well as of force, in the operations of his mind<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">M. de P. Recherches Philos. sur les Americ. pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n.</NOTE>. In opposition to both these, other phi∣losophers have supposed that man arrives at his highest dignity and excellence long before he reaches a state of refinement; and, in the rude simplicity of savage life, displays an elevation of sentiment, an independence of mind, and a warmth of at∣tachment, for which it is vain to search among the members of polished societies<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">M. Rosseau.</NOTE>. They seem to consider that as the most perfect state of man which is the least civilized. They describe the manners of the rude Americans with such rapture, as if they proposed them for models to the rest of the species. These contradictory theories have been proposed with equal confidence, and uncom∣mon powers of genius and eloquence have been ex∣erted, in order to clothe them with an appearance of truth.</P>
<P>AS all those circumstances concur in rendering an inquiry into the state of the rude nations in Ame∣rica intricate and obscure, it is necessary to carry it on with caution. When guided in our researches
<PB N="320" REF="034476_0318_0FFDD7856D0200D0"/>
by the intelligent observations of the few philoso∣phers who have visited this part of the globe, we may venture to decide. When obliged to have recourse to the superficial remarks of vulgar tra∣vellers, of sailors, traders, buccaneers, and mis∣sionaries, we must often pause, and comparing detached facts, endeavour to discover what they wanted sagacity to observe. Without indulging conjecture, or betraying a propensity to either sys∣tem, we must study with equal care to avoid the extremes of extravagant and admiration, or of su∣percilious contempt for those manners which we describe.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Method observed in the inquiry.</NOTE>IN order to conduct this enquiry with greater ac∣curacy, it should be rendered as simple as possible. Man existed as an individual before he became the member of a community; and the qualities which belong to him under his former capacity should be known, before we proceed to examine those which arise from the latter relation. This is pecu∣liarly necessary in investigating the manners of rude nations. Their political union is so incomplete, their civil institutions and regulations so few, so simple, and of such slender authority, that men in this state ought to be viewed rather as independent agents, than as members of a regular society. The character of a savage results almost entirely from his sentiments or feelings as an individual, and is but little influenced by his imperfect subjection to government and order. I shall conduct my re∣searches concerning the manners of the Americans in this natural order, proceeding gradually from what is simple to what is more complicated.</P>
<P>I SHALL consider, I. The bodily constitution of the Americans in those regions now under review. II. The qualities of their minds. III. Their do∣mestic state. IV. Their political state and institu∣tions. V. Their system of war, and public secu∣rity.

VI. The arts with which they were ac∣quainted. VII. Their religious ideas and institu∣tions. VIII. Such singular detached customs as are not reducible to any of the former heads. IX. I shall conclude with a general review and estimate of their virtues and defects.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE bodily constitution of the Americans.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The con∣stitution of their bo∣dies.</NOTE>— The human body is less affected by climate than that of any other animal. Some animals are con∣fined to a particular region of the globe, and can∣not exist beyond it; others, though they may be brought to bear the injuries of a climate foreign to them, cease to multiply when carried out of that district which Nature destined to be their mansion. Even such as seem capable of being naturalized in various climates, feel the effect of every remove from their proper station, and gradually dwindle and degenerate from the vigour and perfection pe∣culiar to their species. Man is the only living creature whose frame is at once so hardy and so flexible, that he can spread over the whole earth, become the inhabitant of every region, and thrive and multiply under every climate. Subject, how∣ever, to the general law of Nature, the human body is not entirely exempt from the operation of climate; and when exposed to the extremes either of heat or cold, its size or vigour diminishes.</P>
<P>THE first appearance of the inhabitants of the New World,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Complex∣ion.</NOTE> filled the discoverers with such asto∣nishment, that they were apt to imagine them a race of men different from those of the other he∣misphere. Their complexion is of a reddish brown, nearly resembling the colour of copper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oviedo Somario, p. 46, D. Life of Columbus, c. 24.</NOTE>. The hair of their heads is always black, long, coarse, and uncurled. They have no beard, and every part of their body is perfectly smooth. Their persons are
<PB N="322" REF="034476_0320_0FFDD74B93FD0120"/>
of a full size, extremely straight and well propor∣tioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLIV.</NOTE>. Their features are regular, though often distorted by absurd endeavours to improve the beauty of their natural form,<NOTE PLACE="marg">More fee∣ble.</NOTE> or to render their aspect more dreadful to their enemies. In the islands, where four-footed animals were both few and small, and the earth yielded her productions almost spontaneously, the constitution of the natives, neither braced by the active exercises of the chace, nor invigorated by the labour of cultivation, was extremely feeble and languid. On the continent, where the forests abound with game of various kinds, and the chief occupation of many tribes was to pursue it, the human frame acquired greater firmness. Still, however, the Americans were more remarkable for agility than strength. They resem∣bled beasts of prey, rather than animals formed for labour<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLV.</NOTE>. They were not only averse to toil, but incapable of it; and when rouzed by force from their native indolence, and compelled to work, they sunk under tasks which the people of the other continent would have performed with ease<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Oviedo Som. p. 51, C.

<P>THE beardless countenance and smooth skin of the American seems to indicate a defect of vigour, occasioned by some vice in his frame. He is desti∣tute of one sign of manhood and of strength. This peculiarity, by which the inhabitants of the New

Fr. iii. 310.</NOTE>. For though the food of many Americans be ex∣tremely insipid, as they are altogether unacquainted with the use of salt, rude tribes in other parts of the earth have subsisted on aliments equally simple, without this mark of degradation, or any apparent symptom of a diminution in their vigour.</P>
<P>AS the external form of the Americans leads us to suspect that there is some natural debility in their frame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Less appe∣tite.</NOTE> the smallness of their appetite for food has been mentioned by many authors as a confirmation of this suspicion. The quantity of food which men consume varies according to the temperature of the climate in which they live, the degree of activity which they exert, and the natural vigour of their constitutions. Under the enervating heat of the torrid zone, and when men pass their days in indo∣lence and ease, they require less nourishment than the active inhabitants of temperate or cold countries. But neither the warmth of their climate, nor their extreme laziness, will account for the uncommon defect of appetite among the Americans. The Spaniards were astonished with observing this, not only in the islands, but in several parts of the conti∣nent. The constitutional temperance of the natives far exceeded, in their opinion, the abstinence of the most mortified hermits<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ramusio, iii. 304, F. 306, A. Simon Conquista, &amp;c. p. 39. Hakluyt, iii. 468, 508.</NOTE>; while, on the other hand, the appetite of the Spaniards appeared to the Ame∣ricans insatiably voracious; and they affirmed, that one Spaniard devoured more food in a day than was sufficient for ten Americans<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. ii. c. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>A PROOF of some feebleness in their frame,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Less ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣mence of desire</NOTE> still more striking, is the insensibility of the Americans
<PB N="324" REF="034476_0322_0FFDD746494C91C8"/>
to the charms of beauty, and the power of love. That passion which was destined to perpetuate life, to be the bond of social union, and the source of tenderness and joy, is the most ardent in the human breast. Though the perils and hardships of the savage state, though excessive fatigue, on some oc∣casions, and the difficulty at all times of procuring subsistence, may seem to be adverse to this passion, and to have a tendency to abate its vigour, yet the rudest nations in every other part of the globe seem to feel its influence more powerfully than the inha∣bitants of the New World. The negro glows with all the warmth of desire natural to his climate; and the most uncultivated Asiatics discover that sensi∣bility, which from their situation on the globe, we should expect them to have felt. But the Ameri∣cans are, in an amazing degree, strangers to the force of this first instinct of nature. In every part of the New World the natives treat their women with coldness and indifference. They are neither the objects of that tender attachment which takes place in civilized society, nor of that ardent desire conspicuous among rude nations. Even in climates where this passion usually acquires its greatest vi∣gour, the savage of America views his female with disdain, as an animal of a less noble species. He is at no pains to win her favour by the assiduity of courtship, and still less solicitous to preserve it by indulgence and gentleness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hennepin Moeurs des Sauvages, 32, &amp;c.

<P>BUT in inquiries concerning either the bodily or mental qualities of particular races of men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reflections <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to there</NOTE> there is not a more common or more seducing error, than that of ascribing to a single cause, those cha∣racteristic peculiarities, which are the effect of the combined operation of many causes. The climate and soil of America differ, in so many respects, from those of the other hemisphere, and this differ∣ence is so obvious and striking, that philosophers of great eminence have laid hold on this as suffi∣cient to account for what is peculiar in the consti∣tution of its inhabitants. They rest on physical causes alone, and consider the feeble frame and languid desire of the Americans, as consequences of the temperament of that portion of the globe which they occupy. But the influences of political and moral causes ought not to have been over∣looked. These operate with no less effect than that on which many philosophers rest as a full ex∣planation of the singular appearances which have been mentioned. Wherever the state of society is such as to create many wants and desires, which cannot be satisfied without regular exertions of in∣dustry, the body accustomed to labour, becomes robust and patient of fatigue. In a more simple state, where the demands of men are so few and so moderate, that they may be gratified, almost with∣out any effort, by the spontaneous productions of nature, the powers of the body are not called forth,
<PB N="326" REF="034476_0324_0FFDD7421F360D20"/>
nor can they attain their proper strength. The na∣tives of Chili and of North-America, the two tem∣perate regions in the New World, who live by hunting, may be deemed an active and vigorous race, when compared with the inhabitants of the isles, or of those parts of the continent where hardly any labour is requisite to procure subsistence. The exertions of a hunter are not, however, so regular, or so continued, as those of persons employed in the culture of the earth, or in the various arts of civilized life, and though his agility may be greater than theirs, his strength is on the whole inferior. If another direction were given to the active pow∣ers of man in the New World, and his force aug∣mented by exercise, he might acquire a degree of vigour which he does not in his present state pos∣sess. The truth of this is confirmed by experience. Wherever the Americans have been gradually ac∣customed to hard labour, their constitutions become robust, and they have been found capable of per∣forming such tasks, as seemed not only to exceed the powers of such a feeble frame as has been deemed peculiar to their country, but to equal any effort of the natives, either of Africa or of Europe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE same reasoning will apply to what has been observed concerning their slender demand for food. As a proof that this should be ascribed as much to their extreme indolence, and often total want of occupation, as to any thing peculiar in the physical structure of their bodies, it has been observed, that in those districts, where the people of America are obliged to exert any unusual effort of activity, in order to procure subsistence, or wherever they are employed in severe labour, their appetite is not in∣ferior to that of other men, and, in some places, it has struck observers as remarkably voracious<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gumilla, ii. 12.70.247. Lafitau, i. 515. Ovalle Church. ii. 81. Muratori, i. 295.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="327" REF="034476_0325_0FFDD73F865DB708"/>THE operation of political and moral causes is still more conspicuous, in modifying the degree of attachment between the sexes. In a state of high civilization, this passion, inflamed by restraint, re∣fined by delicacy, and cherished by fashion, occu∣pies and engrosses the heart. It is no longer a simple instinct of nature; sentiment heightens the ardour of desire, and the most tender emotions of which our frame is susceptible, soothe and agitate the soul. This description, however, applies only to those, who, by their situation, are exempted from the cares and labours of life. Among persons of inferior order, who are doomed by their con∣dition to incessant toil, the dominion of this pas∣sion is less violent; their solicitude to procure sub∣sistence, and to provide for the first demand of na∣ture, leaves little leisure for attending to its second call. But if the nature of the intercourse between the sexes varies so much in persons of different rank in polished societies, the condition of man, while he remains uncivilized, must occasion a va∣riation still more apparent. We may well suppose, that amidst the hardships, the dangers, and the simplicity of savage life, where subsistence is al∣ways precarious, and often scanty, where men are almost continually engaged in the pursuit of their enemies, or in guarding against their attacks, and where neither dress nor reserve are employed as arts of female allurement, that the attention of the Americans to their women would be extremely feeble, without imputing this solely to any physical defect or degradation in their frame.</P>
<P>IT is accordingly observed, that in those coun∣tries of America, where, from the fertility of the soil, the mildness of the climate, or some farther advances which the natives have made in improve∣ment, the means of subsistence are more abundant, and the hardships of savage life are less severely

felt, the animal passion of the sexes becomes more ardent. Striking examples of this occur among some tribes seated on the banks of great rivers well stored with food, among others who are masters of hunting-grounds abounding so much with game, that they have a regular and plentiful supply of nou∣rishment with little labour. The superior degree of security and affluence which these tribes enjoy, is followed by their natural effects. The passions im∣planted in the human frame by the hand of nature acquire additional force; new tastes and desires are formed; the women, as they are more valued and admired, became more attentive to dress and ornament; the men, beginning to feel how much of their own happiness depends upon them, no longer disdain the arts of winning their favour and affection. The intercourse of the sexes becomes very different from that which takes place among their ruder countrymen; and as hardly any restraint is imposed on the gratification of desire, either by religion, or laws, or decency, the dissolution of their manners is excessive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biet. 389.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">None of them de∣formed.</NOTE>NOTWITHSTANDING the feeble make of the Americans, hardly any of them are deformed, or mutilated, or defective in any of their senses. All travellers have been struck with this circumstance, and have celebrated the uniform symmetry and per∣fection of their external figure. Some authors search for the cause of this appearance in their phy∣sical condition. As the parents are not exhausted or over-fatigued with hard labour, they suppose that their children are born vigorous and sound. They imagine, that in the liberty of savage life, the human body, naked and unconfined from its earliest age, preserves its natural form; and that
<PB N="329" REF="034476_0327_0FFDD73A4F8CA6E0"/>
all its limbs and members acquire a juster propor∣tion, than when fettered with artificial restraints, which stints its growth, and distort its shape<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Piso, p. 6.</NOTE>. Something, without doubt, may be ascribed to the operation of these causes; but the true reasons of this apparent advantage, which is common to all savage nations, lie deeper, and are closely inter∣woven with the nature and genius of that state. The infancy of man is so long and so helpless, that it is extremely difficult to rear children among rude nations. Their means of subsistence are not only scanty, but precarious. Such as live by hunting must range over extensive countries, and shift often from place to place. The care of children, as well as every other laborious task, is devolved upon the women. The distresses and hardships of the savage life, which are often such as can hardly be supported by persons in full vigour, must be fatal to those of more tender age. Afraid of under∣taking a task so laborious, and of such long dura∣tion, as that of rearing their offspring, the wo∣men, in some parts of America, procure frequent abortions by the use of certain herbs, and extin∣guish the first sparks of that life which they are unable to cherish<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ellis's Voyage to Hudson's Bay, 198.

Thus, in po∣lished societies, where the means of subsistence are secured with certainty, and acquired with ease; where the talents of the mind are often of more importance than the powers of the body; children are preserved notwithstanding their defects or de∣formity, and grow up to be useful citizens. In rude nations, such persons are either cut off as soon as they are born, or becoming a burden to them∣selves and to the community, cannot long protract their lives. But in those provinces of the New World where, by the establishment of the Eu∣ropeans, more regular provision has been made for the subsistence of its inhabitants, and they are re∣strained from laying violent hands on their children, the Americans are so far from being eminent for any superior perfection in their form, that one should rather suspect some peculiar imbecility in the race, from the extraordinary number of individu∣als who are deformed, dwarfish, mutilated, blind, or deaf<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Ulloa, i. 232.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Uniformity of their ap∣pearance.</NOTE>HOW feeble soever the constitution of the Ame∣ricans may be, it is remarkable, that there is less variety in the human form throughout the New World, than in the ancient continent. When Co∣lumbus and the other discoverers first visited the different countries of America which lie within the torrid zone, they naturally expected to find people of the same complexion with those in the corres∣ponding regions of the other hemisphere. To their amazement, however, they discovered that America contained no negroes<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">P. Martyr, dec. p. 71.</NOTE>; and the cause of this singular appearance became as much the object of curiosity, as the fact itself was of wonder.
<PB N="331" REF="034476_0329_0FFDD78B9959BB18"/>
In what part or membrane of the body that hu∣mour resides which tinges the complexion of the negro with a deep black, it is the business of ana∣tomists to enquire and describe. The powerful ope∣ration of heat appears manifestly to be the cause which produces this striking variety in the human species. All Europe, a great part of Asia, and the temperate countries of Africa, are inhabited by men of a white complexion. All the torrid zone in Africa, some of the warmer regions adjacent to it, and several countries in Asia, are filled with people of a deep black colour. If we survey the nations of our continent, making our progress from cold and temperate countries towards those parts which are exposed to the influence of vehe∣ment and unremitting heat, we shall find, that the extreme whiteness of their skin soon begins to di∣minish; that its colour deepens gradually as we advance; and after passing through all the suc∣cessive gradations of shade, terminates in an uni∣form unvarying black. But in America, where the agency of heat is checked and abated by va∣rious causes, which I have already explained, the climate seems to be destitute of that force which produces such wonderful effects on the human frame. The colour of the natives of the torrid zone, in America, is hardly of a deeper hue than that of the people in the more temperate parts of their continent. Accurate observers, who had an opportunity of viewing the Americans in very dif∣ferent climates, and in provinces far removed from each other, have been struck with the amazing simi∣larity of their figure and aspect<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT though the hand of Nature has deviated so little from one standard in fashioning the human form in America, the creation of fancy hath been
<PB N="332" REF="034476_0330_0FFDD7904B897208"/>
various and extravagant, The same fables that were current in the ancient continent, have been revived with respect to the New World, and Ame∣rica too has been peopled with human beings of monstrous and fantastic appearance. The inhabi∣tants of certain provinces were described to be pig∣mies of three feet high; those of others to be giants of an enormous size. Some travellers published ac∣counts of people with only one eye, others pre∣tended to have discovered men without heads, whose eyes and mouths were planted in their breasts. The variety of Nature in her productions is, indeed, so great, that it is presumptuous to set bounds to her fertility, and to reject indiscriminately every relation that does not perfectly accord with our own limited observation and experience. But the other ex∣treme, of yielding a hasty assent, on the slightest evidence, to whatever has the appearance of being strange and marvellous, is still more unbecoming a philosophical inquirer, as, in every period, men are more apt to be betrayed into error, by their weak∣ness in believing too much, than by their arrogance in believing too little. In proportion as science ex∣tends, and nature is examined with a discerning eye, the wonders which amused ages of ignorance dis∣appear. The tales of credulous travellers con∣cerning America are forgotten; the monsters which they describe have been searched for in vain; and those provinces where they pretended to have found inhabitants of singular forms, are now known to be possessed by people no wise different from the other Americans.</P>
<P>THOUGH those relations may, without discussion, be rejected as fabulous, there are other accounts of varieties in the human species in some parts of the New World, which rest upon better evidence, and merit more attentive examination. This variety has been particularly observed in three different
<PB N="333" REF="034476_0331_0FFDD7350D7148C0"/>
districts. The first of these is situated in the isthmus of Darien, near the centre of America. Lionel Wafer, a traveller possessed of more curiosity and intelligence than we should have expected to find in an associate of Buccaneers, discovered there a race of men few in number, but of a singular make. They are of low stature, according to his descrip∣tion, of a feeble frame, incapable of enduring fa∣tigue. Their colour is a dead milk white; not re∣sembling that of fair people among Europeans, but without any tincture of a blush or sanguine com∣plexion. Their skin is covered with a fine hairy down of a chalky white, the hair of their heads, their eye-brows, and eye-lashes, are of the same hue. Their eyes are of a singular form, and so weak, that they can hardly bear the light of the sun; but they see clearly by moon-light, and are most active and gay in the night<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Wafer Descript. of Isth. ap. Dampier, iii. p. 346.</NOTE>. No race simi∣lar to this has been discovered in any other part of America. Cortes, indeed, found some persons exactly resembling the white people of Darien, among the rare and monstrous animals which Mon∣tezuma had collected<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cortes ap. Ramus. iii. p. 241, E.</NOTE>. But as the power of the Mexican empire extending to the provinces bor∣dering on the isthmus of Darien, they were pro∣bably brought thence. Singular as the appearance of those people may be, they cannot be considered as constituting a distinct species. Among the ne∣groes of Africa, as well as the natives of the Indian islands, nature sometimes produces a small num∣ber of individuals, with all the characteristic fea∣tures and qualities of the white people of Darien. The former are called <HI>Albinos</HI> by the Portuguese, the latter <HI>Kackerlakes</HI> by the Dutch. In Darien the parents of those Whites are of the same colour
<PB N="334" REF="034476_0332_0FFDD791DC758D90"/>
with the other natives of the country; and this ob∣servation applies equally to the anomalous progeny of the negroes and Indians. The same mother who produces some children of a colour that does not belong to the race, brings forth the rest with the complexion peculiar to her country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Margrav. Hist. Rer. Nat. Bras. lib. viii. c. 4.</NOTE>. One conclusion may then be formed with respect to the people described by Wafer, the <HI>Albinos</HI> and <HI>Kack∣erlakes;</HI> they are a degenerated breed, not a sepa∣rate class of men; and from some disease or defect of their parents, the peculiar colour and debility which mark their degradation are transmitted to them. As a decisive proof of this, it has been ob∣served, that neither the white people of Darien, nor the Albinos of Africa, propagate their race: their children are of the colour and tempera∣ment peculiar to the natives of their respective countries<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Wafer, p. 348.

<P>THE second district that is occupied by inhabi∣tants differing in appearance from the other people of America, is situated in a high northern latitude, extending from the coast of Labrador towards the pole, as far as the country is habitable. The people scattered over these dreary regions, are known to the Europeans by the name of <HI>Esquimaux.</HI> They themselves, with that idea of their own superiority, which consoles the rudest and most wretched nati∣ons, assume the name of <HI>Keralit</HI> or <HI>Men.</HI> They are of a middle size, and robust, with heads of a disproportioned bulk, and feet as remarkably small. Their complexion, though swarthy, by being con∣tinually exposed to the rigour of a cold climate, in∣clines to the European white, rather than to the copper colour of America, and the men have beards

which are sometimes bushy and long<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ellis Voy. to Huds. Bay, p. 131. 139. De ia Potherie, tom. i. p. 79. Wales' Journ. of a Voy. to Churchill River. Phil.

From these marks of distinction, as well as from one still less equivocal, the affinity of their language to that of the Greenlanders, which I have already mentioned, we may conclude, with some degree of confidence, that the Esquimaux are a race different from the rest of the Americans.</P>
<P>WE cannot decide with equal certainty concerning the inhabitants of the third district, situated at the southern extremity of America. These are the famous <HI>Patagonians,</HI> who, during two centuries and a half, have afforded a subject of controversy to the learn∣ed, and an object of wonder to the vulgar. They are supposed to be one of the wandering tribes, which occupy that vast, but least known region of America, which extends from the river de la Plata to the Straits of Magellan. Their proper station is in that part of the interior country which lies on the banks of the river Negro; but in the hunting season they frequently roam as far as the Straits which separate Tierra del Fuego from the main∣land. The first accounts of this people, were brought to Europe by the companions of Magel∣lan<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Falkue<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s Description of Pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>onia. p. 102.</NOTE>, who described them as a gigantic race, above eight feet high, and of strength in proportion to their enormous size. Among several tribes of ani∣mals, a disparity in bulk, as considerable, may be observed. Some large breeds of horses and dogs exceed the more diminutive races in stature and strength, as far as the Patagonian is supposed to rise above the usual standard of the human body. But animals attain the highest perfection of their species, only in mild climates, or where they find the most nutritive food in greatest abundance. It
<PB N="336" REF="034476_0334_0FFDD799B9EBB2A0"/>
is not then in the uncultivated waste of the Magel∣lanic regions, and among a tribe of improvident savages, that we should expect to find man posses∣sing the highest honours of his race, and distin∣guished by a superiority of size and vigour, far beyond what he has reached in any other part of the earth. The most explicit and unexceptionable evidence is requisite, in order to establish a fact repugnant to those general principles and laws, which seem to affect the human frame in every other instance, and to decide with respect to its nature and qualities. Such evidence has not hi∣therto been produced. Though several persons, to whose testimony great respect is due, have vi∣sited this part of America since the time of Magel∣lan, and have had interviews with the natives; though some have affirmed, that such as they saw were of gigantic stature, and others have formed the same conclusion from measuring their footsteps, or from viewing the skeletons of their dead; yet their accounts vary from each other in so many essential points, and are mingled with so many cir∣cumstances manifestly false or fabulous, as detract much from their credit. On the other hand, some navigators, and those among the most eminent of their order for discernment and accuracy, have asserted that the natives of Patagonia, with whom they had intercourse, though stout and well-made, are not of such extraordinary size as to be distin∣guished from the rest of the human species <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLIX.</NOTE>. The existence of this gigantic race of men seems, then, to be one of those points in natural history, with respect to which a cautious inquirer will hesitate, and will chuse to suspend his assent until more com∣plete evidence shall decide, whether he ought to admit a fact, seemingly inconsistent with what rea∣son

and experience have discovered concerning the structure and condition of man, in all the various situations in which he has been observed.</P>
<P>IN order to form a complete idea with respect to the constitution of the inhabitants of this and the other hemisphere,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their state of health.</NOTE> we should attend not only to the make and vigour of their bodies, but consider what degree of health they enjoy, and to what period of longevity they usually arrive. In the simplicity of the savage state, when man is not oppressed with labour or enervated by luxury, or disquieted with care, we are apt to imagine that his life will flow on almost untroubled by disease or suffering, until his days be terminated, in extreme old age, by the gradual decays of nature. We find, accordingly, among the Americans, as well as among other rude people, persons, whose decrepit and shrivelled form seems to indicate an extraordinary length of life. But as most of them are unacquainted with the art of numbering, and all of them as forgetful of what is past, they are improvident for what is to come, it is impossible to ascertain their age, with any de∣gree of precision <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ulloa Notic. Americ. 323. Bancroft Nat. Hist. of Gui∣ana, 334.</NOTE>. It is evident, that the period of their longevity must vary considerably, accord∣ing to the diversity of climate, and their different modes of subsistence. They seem, however, to be every where exempt from many of the distempers which afflict polished nations. None of the mala∣dies, which are the immediate offspring of luxury, ever visited them; and they have no names in their languages by which to distinguish this numerous train of adventitious evils.</P>
<P>BUT, whatever be the situation in which man is placed, he is born to suffer; and his diseases,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Diseases▪</NOTE> in the savage state, though fewer in number, are, like
<PB N="338" REF="034476_0336_0FFDD79EED694E20"/>
those of the animals whom he nearly resembles in his mode of life, more violent, and more fatal. If luxury engenders and nourishes distempers of one species, the rigour and distresses of savage life bring on those of another. As men, in this state, are wonderfully improvident, and their means of sub∣sistence precarious, they often pass from extreme want to exuberant plenty, according to the vissici∣tudes of fortune in the chase, or in consequence of the various degree of abundance with which the earth affords to them its productions, in different seasons. Their inconsiderate gluttony in the one situation, and their severe abstinence in the other, are equally pernicious. For though the human constitution may be accustomed by habit, like that of animals of prey, to tolerate long famine, and then to gorge voraciously, it is not a little affected by such sudden and violent transitions. The strength and vigour of savages are, at some seasons, impair∣ed by what they suffer from scarcity of food; at others they are afflicted with disorders arising from indigestion and a superfluity of gross aliment. These are so common, that they may be considered as the unavoidable consequence of their mode of sub∣sisting, and cut off considerable numbers in the prime of life. They are likewise extremely sub∣ject to consumptions, to pleuritic, asthmatic, and paralytic disorders<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 364. Lasitau, ii, 360. De la Po∣therie, ii. 37.</NOTE>, brought on by the immode∣rate hardships and fatigue which they endure in hunting and in war; or owing to the inclemency of the seasons to which they are continually exposed. In the savage state, hardships and fatigue violently assault the constitution. In polished societies, in∣temperance undermines it. It is not easy to deter∣mine which of them operates with most fatal effect,
<PB N="339" REF="034476_0337_0FFDD7A1C4681128"/>
or tends most to abridge human life. The influence of the former is certainly most extensive. The per∣nicious consequences of luxury reach only a few members in any community, the distresses of savage life are felt by all. As far as I can judge, after very minute enquiry, the general period of human life is shorter among savages, than in well-regulated and industrious societies.</P>
<P>ONE dreadful malady, the severest scourge, with which, in this life, offended Heaven chastens the indulgence of criminal desire, seems to have been peculiar to the Americans. By communicating it to their conquerors, they have not only amply avenged their own wrongs, but by adding this ca∣lamity to those which formerly imbittered human life, they have, perhaps, more than counterbalanced all the benefits which Europe has derived from the discovery of the New World. This distemper, from the country in which it first raged, or from the people by whom it was supposed to have been spread over Europe, has been sometimes called the Neapolitan, and sometimes the French disease. At its first appearance, the infection was so malignant, its symptoms so violent, its operations so rapid and fatal, as to basslle all the efforts of medical skill. Astonishment and terror accompanied this unknown affliction in its progress, and men began to dread the extinction of the human race by such a cruel visitation. Experience, and the ingenuity of phy∣sicians, gradually discovered remedies of such vir∣tue as to cure or to mitigate the evil. During the course of two centuries and a half, its virulence seems to have abated considerably. At length, in the same manner with the leprosy, which raged in Europe for some centuries, it may waste its force and disappear; and in some happier age, this west∣ern infection, like that from the east, may be known only by description<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE L.</NOTE>.</P>

With respect to it, too, there is a period of infancy, during which several powers of the mind are not unfolded, and all are feeble and defective in their operation. In the early ages of society, while the condition of man is simple and rude, his reason is but little exercised, and his desires move within a very narrow sphere. Hence arise two remarkable characteristics of the human mind in this state. Its intellectual powers are extremely limited; its emotions and efforts are few and languid. Both these distinctions are con∣spicuous among the rudest and most unimproved of the American tribes, and constitute a striking part of their description.</P>

They follow blindly the impulse of the appetite which they feel, but are entirely regardless of distant con∣sequences, and even of those removed in the least degree from immediate apprehension.

<P>IF in concerns the most interesting, and seem∣ingly the most simple, the reason of man, while rude and destitute of culture, differs so little from the thoughtless levity of children, or the improvi∣dent instinct of animals, its exertions in other di∣rections cannot be very considerable. The ob∣jects towards which reason turns, and the disquisi∣tions in which it engages, must depend upon the
<PB N="342" REF="034476_0340_0FFDD7A6F7207128"/>
state in which man is placed, and are suggested by his necessities and desires. Disquisitions, which ap∣pear the most necessary and important to men in one state of society, never occur to those in ano∣ther. Among civilized nations, arithmetic, or the art of numbering, is deemed an essential and elementary science, and in our continent, the in∣vention and use of it reaches back to a period so remote as is beyond the knowledge of history. But among savages, who have no property to estimate, no hoarded treasures to count, no variety of ob∣jects or multiplicity of ideas to enumerate, arith∣metic is a superfluous and useless art. Accordingly, among some tribes in America it seems to be quite unknown. There are many who cannot reckon farther than three; and have no denomination to distinguish any number above it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Condam. p. 67. Stadius ap de Bry, ix. 128. Lery. ibid. 251.

His thoughts extend not beyond what relates to animal life, and when they are not directed towards some of its concerns, his mind is totally inactive. In situations where no extraordinary effort either of ingenuity or labour is requisite, in order to satisfy the simple demands of nature, the powers of the mind are so seldom roused to any exertion, that the rational faculties continue almost dormant and unexercised. The numerous tribes scattered over the rich plains of South-America, the inhabitants of some of the islands, and of several fertile regions on the conti∣nent, come under this description. Their vacant countenance, their staring unexpressive eye, their listless inattention, and total ignorance of subjects, which seem to be the first which should occupy the thoughts of rational beings, made such impression upon the Spaniards, when they first beheld those rude people, that they considered them as animals of an inferior order, and could not believe that they belonged to the human species<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. 2. c. 15.</NOTE>.

and they have been astonished and humbled, with observing how nearly man, in this condition, ap∣proaches to the brute creation. But in severer climates, where subsistence cannot be procured with the same ease, where men must unite more closely, and act with greater concert, necessity calls forth their talents, and sharpens their invention, so that the intellectual powers are more exercised and im∣proved. The North-American tribes and the na∣tives of Chili, who inhabit the temperate regions in the two great districts of America, are people of cultivated and enlarged understandings, when viewed in comparison with some of those seated in the islands, or on the banks of the Maragnon and Orinoco. Their occupations are more various, their system of policy, as well as of war, more complex, their arts more numerous. But, even among them, the intellectual powers are extremely limited in their operations, and unless when turned directly to those objects which interest a savage, are held in no estimation. Both the North-Americans and Chilese, when not engaged in some of the functions belonging to a warrior or hunter, loiter away their time in thoughtless indolence, unac∣quainted with any other subject worthy of their attention, or capable of occupying their minds<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lafitau, ii. 2.</NOTE>. If even among them, reason is so much circumscribed in its exertions, and never arrives, in its highest at∣tainments, at the knowledge of those general prin∣ciples and maxims, which serve as the foundation of science, we may conclude, that the intellectual pow∣ers of man in the savage state, are destitute of their proper object, and cannot acquire any considerable degree of vigour and enlargement.</P>
<P>FROM the same causes, the active efforts of the mind are few, and, on most occasions, languid.

If we examine into the motives which rouze men to activity in civilized life, and prompt them to persevere in fatiguing exertions of their ingenuity or strength,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Active ef∣forts of the mind few and lan∣guid.</NOTE> we shall find that they arise chiefly from acquired wants and appetites. These are numerous and importunate; they keep the mind in perpetual agitation, and, in order to gratify them, invention must be always on the stretch, and industry must be incessantly employed. But the desires of simple nature are few, and where a favourable climate yields almost spontaneously what suffices to gratify them, they scarcely stir the soul, or excite any violent emotion. Hence the people of several tribes in America waste their life in a list∣less indolence. To be free from occupation, seems to be all the enjoyment towards which they aspire. They will continue whole days stretched out in their hammocks, or seated on the earth, in per∣fect idleness, without changing their posture, or raising their eyes from the ground, or uttering a single word<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boguer Voy. au Perou, 102.

The cravings of hunger may rouse them; but as they devour, with little distinction, whatever will appease its instinctive demands, the exertions which these occasion, are of short dura∣tion. Destitute of ardour, as well as variety of desire, they feel not the force of those powerful springs which give vigour to the movements of the mind, and urge the patient hand of industry to per∣severe in its efforts.

no effects of his activity, and the principle of un∣derstanding which should direct it, seems hardly to be unfolded. Like the other animals, he has no fixed residence; he has erected no habitation to shelter him from the inclemency of the weather; he has taken no measures for securing certain sub∣sistence; he neither sows nor reaps; but roams about as led in search of the plants and fruits which the earth brings forth in succession; and in quest of the game which he kills in the forests, or of the fish, which he catches in the rivers.</P>
<P>THIS description, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some va∣riety with respect to all these.</NOTE> applies only to some tribes. Man cannot continue long in this state of feeble and uninformed infancy. He was made for industry and action, and the powers of his nature, as well as the necessity of his condition, urge him to fulfil his destiny. Accordingly, among most of the American nations, especially those seated in rigo∣rous climates, some efforts are employed, and some previous precautions are taken, for securing subsist∣ence. The career of regular industry is begun, and the laborious arm has made the first essays of its power. Still, however, the improvident and slothful genius of the savage state predominates. Even among those more improved tribes, labour is deemed ignominious and degrading. It is only to work of a certain kind that a man will deign to put his hand. The greater part is devolved entirely upon the women. One half of the community re∣mains inactive, while the other is oppressed with the multitude and variety of its occupations. Thus their industry is partial, and the foresight which re∣gulates it, is no less limited. A remarkable in∣stance of this occurs in the chief arrangement with respect to their manner of living. They depend for their subsistence, during one part of the year, on fishing; during another, on hunting; during a third, on the produce of their agriculture. Though
<PB N="348" REF="034476_0346_0FFDD82207067258"/>
experience has taught them to foresee the return of those various seasons, and to make some provision for the respective exigencies of each, they either want sagacity to proportion this provision to their consumption, or are so incapable of any command over their appetites, that from their inconsiderate waste, they often feel the calamities of famine as severely as the rudest of the savage tribes. What they suffer one year does not augment their in∣dustry, or render them more provident to prevent similar distresses<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 338. Lettr. Edif. 23. 298.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Domestic union.</NOTE>THE domestic state is the first and most simple form of human association. The union of the sexes, among different animals, is of longer or shorter duration in proportion to the ease or difficulty of rearing their offspring. Among those tribes where the season of infancy is short, and the young
<PB N="349" REF="034476_0347_0FFDD7B2BA713650"/>
soon acquire vigour or agility, no permanent union is formed. Nature commits the care of training up the offspring to the mother alone, and her ten∣derness, without any other assistance, is equal to the task. But where the state of infancy is long and helpless, and the joint assiduity of both parents is requisite in tending their feeble progeny, there a more intimate connexion takes place, and conti∣nues until the purpose of nature be accomplished, and the new race grow up to full maturity. As the infancy of man is more feeble and helpless than that of any other animal, and he is dependent, during a much longer period, on the care and fore∣sight of his parents, the union between husband and wife came early to be considered, not only as a solemn, but as a permanent contract. A general state of promiscuous intercourse between the sexes, never existed but in the imagination of poets. In the infancy of society, when men, destitute of arts and industry, lead a hard precarious life, the rearing of their progeny demands the attention and efforts of both parents; and if their union had not been formed and continued with this view, the race could not have been preserved. Accordingly, in America, even among the rudest tribes, a regular union be∣tween husband and wife was universal, and the rights of marriage were understood and recognized. In those districts where subsistence was scanty, and the difficulty of maintaining a family was great, the man confined himself to one wife. In warmer and more fertile provinces, the facility of procuring food concurred with the influence of climate, in inducing the inhabitants to increase the number of their wives<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettr.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Condition of women.</NOTE>BUT in whatever light the Americans considered the obligation of this contract, either as perpetual, or only as temporary, the condition of women was equally humiliating and miserable. Whether man has been improved by the progress of arts and civi∣lization in society, is a question, which, in the wan∣tonness of disputation, has been agitated among philosophers. That women are indebted to the refinements of polished manners for a happy change in their state, is a point which can admit of no doubt. To despise and to degrade the female sex, is the characteristic of the savage state in every part of the globe. Man, proud of excelling in strength and in courage, the chief marks of pre-eminence among rude people, treats woman, as an inferior, with disdain. The Americans, perhaps from that coldness and insensibility which has been considered as peculiar to their constitution, add neglect and harshness to contempt. The most intelligent tra∣vellers have been struck with this inattention of the Americans to their women. It is not, as I have al∣ready observed, by a studied display of tenderness and attachment, that the American endeavours to gain the heart of the woman whom he wishes to marry. Marriage itself, instead of being an union of affec∣tion and interests between equals, becomes, among, them, the unnatural conjunction of a master with his slave. It is the observation of an author, whose opinions are deservedly of great weight, that where∣ever wives are purchased, their condition is ex∣tremely

In whatever part of the globe this custom prevails, the observa∣tion holds. In countries where refinement has made some progress, women, when purchased, are excluded from society, shut up in sequestered apart∣ments, and kept under the vigilant guard of their masters. In ruder nations, they are degraded to the meanest functions. Among many people of America, the marriage-contract is properly a pur∣chase. The man buys his wife of her parents. Though unacquainted with the use of money, or with such commercial transactions as take place in more improved society, he knows how to give an equivalent for any object which he desires to pos∣sess. In some places, the suitor devotes his service for a certain time to the parents of the maid whom he courts▪ in others, he hunts for them occasion∣ally, or assists in cultivating their fields, and forming their canoes; in others he offers presents of such things as are deemed most valuable on account of their usefulness or rarity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lafitau Moeurs, &amp;c. i. 560, &amp;c.

In return for these, he receives his wife; and this circumstance, added to the low estimation of women among savages, leads him to consider her as a female servant whom he has purchased, and whom he has a title to treat as an inferior. In all unpolished nations, it is true, the functions in domestic oeconomy, which fall na∣turally to the share of women, are so many, that they are subjected to hard labour, and must bear more than their full portion of the common burden.

Among wandering tribes, or such as depend chiefly upon hunting for subsistence, the mother cannot attempt to rear a second child, until the first has attained such a degree of vigour as to be in some measure independent of her care.

But in rude nations, the dependence of children upon their parents is of shorter continuance than in po∣lished societies. When men must be trained to the various functions of civil life by previous disci∣pline and education, when the knowledge of abstruse sciences must be taught, and dexterity in intricate arts must be acquired, before a young man is pre∣pared to begin his career of action, the attentive feelings of a parent are not confined to the years of infancy, but extend to what is more remote, the establishment of his child in the world. Even then, his solicitude does not terminate. His pro∣tection may still be requisite, and his wisdom and experience still prove useful guides. Thus a per∣manent connexion is formed; parental tenderness is exercised, and filial respect returned, throughout the whole course of life. But in the simplicity of the savage state, the affection of parents, like the instinctive fondness of animals, ceases almost en∣tirely as soon as their offspring attain maturity. Little instruction fits them for that mode of life to which they are destined. The parents, as if their duty were accomplished, when they have conducted their children through the helpless years of infancy, leave them afterwards at entire liberty.

sustain themselves in this manner. The greater part of the American nations, dispersed over the forests with which their country is covered, do not procure subsistence with the same facility. For al∣though these forests, especially in the southern con∣tinent of America, are stored plentifully with game<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. Martyr. decad. p. 324. Gumiilla, ii. 4, &amp;c. Acugna, i. 156.</NOTE>, considerable efforts of activity and ingenuity are re∣quisite in pursuit of it. Necessity incited the na∣tives to the one, and taught them the other. Hunt∣ing became their principal occupation; and as it called forth strenuous exertions of courage, of force, and of invention, it was deemed no less ho∣nourable than necessary. This occupation was pe∣culiar to the men. They were trained to it from their earliest youth. A bold and dexterous hunter ranked next in fame to the distinguished warrior, and an alliance with the former is often courted in preference to one with the latter<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlev. Histoire de la N. France, iii. 115.</NOTE>. Hardly any de∣vice, which the ingenuity of man has discovered for ensnaring or destroying wild animals, was un∣known to the Americans. While engaged in this favourite exercise, they shake off the indolence pe∣culiar to their nature, the latent powers and vigour of their minds are rouzed, and they become active, persevering, and indefatigable. Their sagacity in finding their prey, and their address in killing it, are equal. Their reason and their senses being constantly directed towards this one object, the former displays such fertility of invention, and the latter acquire such a degree of acuteness, as appear almost incredible. They discern the footsteps of a wild beast, which escape every other eye, and can follow them with certainty through the pathless fo∣rest. If they attack their game openly, their ar∣row

Purchas. iv. p. 1287.</NOTE>; if they endea∣vour to circumvent it by art, it is almost impossible to avoid their toils. Among several tribes, their young men were not permitted to marry, until they had given such proofs of their skill in hunt∣ing, as put it beyond doubt that they were capable of providing for a family. Their ingenuity, always on the stretch, and sharpened by emulation, as well as necessity, has struck out many inventions, which greatly facilitate success in the chase. The most singular of these is the discovery of a poison in which they dip the arrows employed in hunting. The slightest wound with those envenomed shafts is mortal. If they only pierce the skin, the blood fixes and congeals in a moment, and the strongest animal falls motionless to the ground. Nor does this poison, notwithstanding its violence and sub∣tlety, insect the flesh of the animal which it kills. That may be eaten with perfect safety, and retains its native relish and qualities. All the nations situ∣ated upon the banks of the Maragnon and Orinoco are acquainted with this composition, the chief in∣gredient in which is the juice extracted from the root of the <HI>curare,</HI> a species of withe<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gumilla, ii. 1, &amp;c.

Hardly any region of the earth furnishes man spontaneously with what his wants require. In the mildest climates, and most fertile soils, his own industry and soresight must be exerted, in some degree, to secure a regular supply of food. Their experience of this surmounts the abhorrence of labour natural to savage nations, and compels them to have recourse to culture, as subsidiary to hunting. In particular situations, some small tribes may subsist by fishing, independent of any pro∣duction of the earth, raised by their own industry. But thoughout all America, we scarcely meet with any nation of hunters, which does not practise some species of cultivation.</P>

As game and fish are their principal food, all they aim at by cultiva∣tion, is to supply any occasional defect of these. In the southern continent of America, the natives confined their industry to rearing a few plants, which, in a rich soil and warm climate, were easily trained to maturity. The chief of these is <HI>Maize,</HI> well known in Europe by the name of Turkey or Indian wheat, a grain extremely prolific, of simple culture, agreeable to the taste, and affording a strong hearty nourishment.

One species of manioc is altogether free of any poisonous quality, and may be eaten without any preparation but that of roast∣ing it in the embers. This, it is probable, was first used by the Americans as food, and necessity hav∣ing gradually taught them the art of separating its pernicious juice from the other species, they have by experience found it to be more prolific as well as more nourishing<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Martyr.

the chief object of culture among the hunting tribe on the continent of America, and with a moderate exertion of active and provident industry, these might have yielded a supply to the wants of a numerous people. But men, accustomed to the free and vagrant life of hunters, are incapable of regular application to labour; and consider agri∣culture as a secondary and inferior occupation. Accordingly, the provision for subsistence, arising from cultivation, was so limited and scanty among the Americans, that, upon any accidental failure of their usual success in hunting, they were often reduced to extreme distress.</P>
<P>IN the islands, the mode of subsisting was con∣siderably different. None of the large animals which abound on the continent were known there. Only four species of quadrupeds, besides a kind of small dumb dog, existed in the islands, the biggest of which did not exceed the size of a rabbit<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oviedo, lib. xii. in proem.</NOTE> To hunt such diminutive prey, was an occupation which required no effort either of activity or courage. The chief employment of a hunter in the isles was to kill birds, which on the continent are deemed ig∣noble game, and left chiefly to the pursuit of boys<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ribas Hist. de los Triumph. p. 13. De la Potherie, ii. 33. iii 20.</NOTE>. This want of animals, as well as their peculiar situation, led the islanders to depend principally upon fishing for their subsistence<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Oviedo, lib. xiii. c. 1. Gomara, Hist. Gener. c. 28.</NOTE>. Their rivers, and the sea with which they are surrounded, sup∣plied them with this species of food.

Maize<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LX.</NOTE>, manico, and other plants, were cultivated in the same manner as on the continent. But all the fruits of their industry,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their agri∣culture ve∣ry limited.</NOTE> together with what their soil and climate produced spontaneously, afforded them but a scanty mainte∣nance. Though their demands for food▪ were very sparing, they hardly raised what was sufficient for their own consumption. If a few Spaniards settled in any district, such a small addition of supernume∣rary mouths soon exhausted their scanty stores, and brought on a famine.</P>
<P>TWO circumstances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Two causes of its im∣perfection.</NOTE> common to all the savage nations of America, concurred with those which I have already mentioned, not only in rendering their agriculture imperfect, but in circumscribing their power in all their operations. They had no tame animals; and they were unacquainted with the useful metals.</P>
<P>IN other parts of the globe, man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The want of tame animal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE> in his rudest siate appears as lord of the creation, giving law to various tribes of animals, which he has tamed and reduced to subjection. The Tartar follows his prey on the horse which he has reared; or tends his numerous herds, which furnish him both with food and clothing; the Arab has rendered the camel docile, and avails himself of its persevering strength; the Laplander has formed the rein-deer to be subservient to his will; and even the people of Kamchatka have trained their dogs to labour. This command over the inferior creatures is one of the noblest prerogatives of man, and among the greatest efforts of his wisdom and power. Without this, his dominion is incomplete. He is a mo∣narch, who has no subjects; a master, without ser∣vants,
<PB N="364" REF="034476_0362_0FFDD7DA090B5A78"/>
and must perform every operation by the strength of his own arm. Such was the condition of all the rude nations in America. Their reason was so little improved, or their union so incom∣plete, that they seem not to have been conscious of the superiority of their nature, and suffered all the animal creation to retain its liberty, without establishing their own authority over any one spe∣cies. Most of the animals, indeed, which have been rendered domestic in our continent, do not exist in the New World; but those peculiar to it are neither so fierce, nor so forminable, as to have exempted them from servitude. There are some animals of the same species in both continents. But the rein-deer, which has been tamed and broken to the yoke in the one hemisphere, runs wild in the other. The <HI>bison</HI> of America is manifestly of the same species with the horned cattle of the other he∣misphere<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Buffon, Artic. <HI>Bison.</HI></NOTE> The latter, even among the rudest nations in our continent, have been rendered do∣mestic; and, in consequence of his dominion over them, man can accomplish works of labour with greater facility, and has made a great addition to his means of subsistence. The inhabitants of many regions of the New World, where the bison abounds, might have derived the same advantages from it. It is not of a nature so indocile, but that it might have been trained to be as subservient to man as our cattle<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Nouv. Decouverte par Hennepin, p. 192. Kalm. i. 207.</NOTE>. But a savage, in that uncultivated state wherein the Americans were discovered, is the enemy of the other animals, not their superior. He wastes and destroys, but knows not how to multi∣ply or to govern them<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Buffon Hist. Nat. ix. 85. Hist. Philos. et Polit. des Eta∣blissem. des Europ. dans les deux Indes, vi. 364.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="365" REF="034476_0363_0FFDD7DB9AD9C780"/>THIS, perhaps, is the most notable distinction between the inhabitants of the Ancient and New Worlds, and a high pre-eminence of civilized men above such as continue rude. The greatest opera∣tions of man in changing and improving the face of nature, as well as his most considerable efforts in cultivating the earth, are accomplished by means of the aid which he receives from the animals whom he has tamed and employs in labour. It is by their strength that he subdues the stubborn soil, and con∣verts the desert or marsh into a fruitful field. But man, in his civilized state, is so accustomed to the service of the domestic animals, that he seldom re∣flects upon the vast benefits which he derives from it. If we were to suppose to him, even when most improved, to be deprived of their useful ministry, his empire over nature must in some measure cease, and he would remain a feeble animal, at a loss how to subsist, and incapable of attempting such arduous undertakings as their assistance enables him to exe∣cute with ease.</P>
<P>IT is a doubtful point,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Want of the useful metals.</NOTE> whether the dominion of man over the animal creation, or his acquiring the use of metals, has contributed most to extend his power. The aera of this important discovery is unknown, and in our hemisphere very remote. It is only by tradition, or by digging up some rude instruments of our forefathers, that we learn that mankind were originally unacquainted with the use of metals, and endeavoured to supply the want of them by employing flints, shells, bones, and other hard substances, for the same purposes which me∣tals serve among polished nations. Nature com∣pletes the formation of some metals. Gold, silver, and copper, are found in their perfect state in the clefts of rocks, in the sides of mountains, or the channels of rivers. These were accordingly the metals first known, and first applied to use. But
<PB N="366" REF="034476_0364_0FFDD788938139A0"/>
iron, the most serviceable of all, and to which man is most indebted, is never discovered in its perfect form; its gross and stubborn ore must feel twice the force of fire, and go through two laborious pro∣cesses, before it become fit for use. Man was long acquainted with the other metals, before he acquired the art of fabricating iron, or attained such ingenuity as to perfect an invention, to which he is indebted for those instruments wherewith he sub∣dues the earth, and commands all its inhabitants. But in this, as well as in many other respects, the inferiority of the Americans was conspicuous. All the savage tribe, scattered over the continent and islands, were totally unacquainted with the metals which their soil produced in great abundance, if we except some trifling quantity of gold, which they picked up in the torrents that descended from their mountains, and formed into ornaments. Their devices to supply this want of the serviceable metals, were extremely rude and awkward. The most simple operation was to them an undertaking of immense difficulty and labour. To fell a tree with no other instruments than hatchets of stone, was employment for a month <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gumilla, iii. 196.</NOTE>. To form a canoe into shape, and to hollow it, consumed years, and it frequently began to rot before they were able to finish it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Borde Relat. des Caraibes, p. 22.</NOTE>. Their operations in agriculture were equally slow and defective. In a country covered with woods of the hardest timber, the clearing of a small field destined for culture required the united efforts of a tribe, and was a work of much time and great toil. This was the business of the men and their indolence was satisfied with performing it in a very slovenly manner. The labour of cultiva∣tion was left to the women, who, after digging, or
<PB N="367" REF="034476_0365_0FFDD7DE32E3D118"/>
rather stirring the field, with wooden mattocks, and stakes hardened in the fire, sowed or planted it; but they were more indebted for the increase to the fertility of the soil, than to their own rude in∣dustry<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gumilla, iii. 166, &amp;c. Lettr. Edif. xii. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AGRICULTURE, even when the strength of man is seconded by that of the animals which he has subjected to the yoke, and his power augmented by the use of the various instruments with which the discovery of metals has furnished him, is still a work of great labour; and it is with the sweat of his brow that he renders the earth fertile. It is not wonderful, then, that people destitute of both these advantages should have made so little progress in cultivation, that they must be considered as de∣pending for subsistence on fishing and hunting, ra∣ther than on the fruits of their own labour.</P>
<P>FROM this description of the mode of subsisting among the rude American tribes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Political institutions arising from this state.</NOTE> the form and ge∣nius of their political institutions may be deduced, and we are enabled to trace various circumstances of distinction between them and more civilized na∣tions.</P>
<P N="1">1. THEY were divided into small independent communities.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1.

The increase of a society in this state is limited by its own nature, and the members of it must either disperse, like the game which they pursue, or fall upon some better method of procuring food, than by hunting.

They cannot form into large communities, because it would be im∣possible to find subsistence; and they must drive to a distance every rival who may incroach on those domains, which they consider as their own. This was the state of all the American tribes, the num∣bers in each were inconsiderable, though scattered over countries of great extent; they were far re∣moved from one another, and engaged in perpetual hostilities or rivalship<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lozano, Descrip. del Gran Chaco, 59. 62.

Where game is so plentiful that it may be catched with little trouble, men never dream of appropriating what is of small value, or of easy acquisition. Where it is so rare, that the la∣bour or danger of the chase requires the united efforts of a tribe, or village, what is killed is a com∣mon stock, belonging equally to all, who, by their skill or their courage, have contributed to the success of the excursion. The forest, or hunting-grounds, are deemed the property of the tribe, from which it has a title to exclude every rival nation. But no individual arrogates a right to any district of these, in preference to his fellow citizens. They belong alike to all; and thither, as to a ge∣neral and undivided store, all repair in quest of sustenance.

<P>SUCH was the form of political order established among the greater part of the American nations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">To what people those de∣scriptions apply.</NOTE> In this state were almost all the tribes spread over the provinces extending eastward of the Missisippi, from the mouth of the St. Laurence to the confines of Florida. In a similar condition were the people of Brasil, the inhabitants of Chili, several tribes in Paraguay and Guiana, and in the countries which stretched from the mouth of the Orinoco to the pe∣ninsula of Yucatan. Among such an infinite num∣ber of petty associations, there may be peculiarities which constitute a distinction, and mark the various degrees of their civilization and improvement. But an attempt to trace and enumerate these would be vain, as they have not been observed by persons capable of discerning the minute and delicate cir∣cumstances, which serve to discriminate nations resembling one another in their general character and features. The description which I have given of the political institutions that took place among those rude tribes in America, concerning which we have received most complete information, will apply, with little variation, to every people, both in its northern and southern division, who have ad∣vanced no farther in civilization, than to add some slender degree of agriculture to fishing and hunt∣ing.</P>
<P>IMPERFECT as those institutions may appear, se∣veral tribes were not so far advanced in their politi∣cal progress. Among all those petty nations which trusted for subsistence entirely to fishing and hunt∣ing without any species of cultivation, the union was so incomplete, and their sense of mutual de∣pendence so feeble, that hardly any appearance of government or order can be discerned in their pro∣ceedings. Their wants are few, their objects of
<PB N="374" REF="034476_0372_0FFDD7F1E0CE6C18"/>
pursuit simple, they form into separate tribes, and act together, from instinct, habit, or conveni∣ency, rather than from any formal concert and as∣sociation. To this class belong the Californians, several of the small nations in the extensive country of Paraguay, some of the people on the banks of the Orinoco, and on the river St. Magdalene, in the new kingdom of Granada<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Venegas, i. 68.

<P>BUT though among these last-mentioned tribes there was hardly any shadow of regular govern∣ment, and even among those which I first de∣scribed, its authority is slender and confined within narrow bounds, there were, however, some places in America where government was carried far be∣yond the degree of perfection which seems natural to rude nations. In surveying the political opera∣tions of man, either in his savage or civilized state, we discover singular and eccentric institutions, which start as it were from their station, and fly off so wide, that we labour in vain to bring them within the general laws of any system, or to account for them by those principles which influence other communities in a similar situation. Some instances of this occur among those people of America, whom I have included under the common denomi∣nation of savage. These are so curious and im∣portant that I shall describe them, and attempt to ex∣plain their origin.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Particular∣ly in some of the war∣mer re∣gions.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the New World, as well as in other parts of the globe, cold or temperate countries appear to be the favourite seat of freedom and independence.

warmer climates, by whose influence the whole frame is so much enervated, that present pleasure is the supreme felicity, and mere repose is enjoyment, men acquiesce, almost without a struggle, in the dominion of a superior. Accordingly, if we pro∣ceed from north to south along the continent of America, she shall find the power of those vested with authority gradually increasing, and the spirit of the people becoming more tame and passive. In Florida, the authority of the sachems, caziques, or chiefs was not only permanent, but hereditary. They were distinguished by peculiar ornaments, they enjoyed prerogatives of various kinds, and were treated by their subjects with that reverence, which people accustomed to subjection pay to a master<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cardenas y Cano Ensayo Chronol a la Hist. de Florida, p. 46.

Among the Natchez, a powerful tribe now extinct,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Among the Natchez.</NOTE> formerly situated on the banks of the Missisippi, a difference of rank took place, with which the north∣ern tribes were altogether unacquainted. Some fa∣milies were reputed noble, and enjoyed hereditary dignity. The body of the people was considered as vile, and formed only for subjection.

comes with profound humility and offers him his head. Nor does the dominion of the Chiefs end with their lives; their principal officers, their fa∣vourite wives, together with many domestics of in∣ferior rank, are sacrificed at their tombs, that they may be attended in the next world by the same per∣sons who served them in this; and such is the reve∣rence in which they are held, that those victims wel∣come death with exultation, deeming it a recompence of their fidelity, and a mark of distinction, to be se∣lected to accompany their deceased master<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dumont Memoir.

Thus a perfect despotism, with its full train of superstition, arrogance, and cruelty, is established among the Natchez, and by a singular fatality, that people has tasted of the worst calamities incident to polished nations, though they themselves are not far advanced beyond the tribes around them in civility and im∣provement. In Hispaniola,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In the Islands.</NOTE> Cuba, and the larger islands, their caziques or chiefs possessed extensive power. The dignity was transmitted by hereditary right from father to son. Its honours and preroga∣tives were considerable. Their subjects paid great respect to the caziques, and executed their orders without hesitation or reserve<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. i. c. 16. lib. iii. c. 44. p. 88.

They were distin∣guished by peculiar ornaments, and in order to pre∣serve or augment the veneration of the people, they had the address to call in the aid of superstition to uphold their authority.

as in the isles. In Bogota, which is now a pro∣vince of the new kingdom of Granada, there was settled a nation, more considerable in number and more improved in the various arts of life, than any in America except the Mexicans and Peruvians. The people of Bogota subsisted chiefly by agriculture. The idea of property was introduced among them, and its rights, secured by laws, handed down by tra∣dition, and observed with great care<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Piedrahita Hist. de las Conquist del N. Rayno de Gran. p. 46.</NOTE>. They lived in towns which may be termed large, when compared with those in other parts of America. They were clothed in a decent manner, and their houses may be termed commodious, when compared with those of the small tribes around them. The effects of this uncommon civilization were conspicuous. Government had assumed a regular form. A juris∣diction was established, which took cognizance of different crimes, and punished them with rigour. A distinction of ranks was known; their chief, to whom the Spaniards gave the title of monarch, and who merited that name on account of his splendour as well as power, reign with absolute authority. He was attended by officers of various conditions, he never appeared in public without a numerous reti∣nue; he was carried in a sort of palanquin with much pomp, and harbingers went before him to sweep the road and strew it with flowers. This uncommon pomp was supported by presents or taxes received from his subjects, to whom their prince was such an object of veneration, that none of them presumed to look him directly in the face, or ever approached him but with an averted coun∣tenance<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 6. lib. i. c. 2. lib. v. c. 56.

the people of Bogota in their progress towards refinement, the freedom and independence, na∣tural to man in his savage state, was much abridged, and their caziques had assumed extensive autho∣rity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of those irre∣gular ap∣pearances.</NOTE>IT is not easy to point out the circumstances, or to discover the causes which contributed to introduce and establish among each of those people a form of government so different from that of the tribes around them, and so repugnant to the genius of rude nations. If the persons who had an opportu∣nity of observing them in their original state, had been more attentive and more discerning, we might have received information from their conquerors sufficient to guide us in this enquiry. If the trans∣actions of people, unacquainted with the use of let∣ters, were not involved in impenetrable obscurity, we might have derived some information from this domestic source. But as nothing satisfactory can be gathered, either from the accounts of the Spa∣niards, or from their own traditions, we must have recourse to conjectures, in order to explain the irregular appearances in the political state of the people whom I have mentioned. As all those tribes which had lost then native liberty and inde∣pendence were seated in the Torrid Zone, or in countries approaching to it, the climate may be supposed to have had some influence in forming their minds to that servitude, which seems to be the destiny of man in those regions of the globe. But though the influence of climate, more powerful than that of any other natural cause, is not be over∣looked; that alone cannot be admitted as a solution of the point in question. The operations of men are so complex, that we must not attribute the form which they assume, to the force of a single prin∣ciple or cause. Although despotism be confined in America to the Torrid Zone, and to the warm re∣gions
<PB N="379" REF="034476_0377_0FFDD7FF09DDCD78"/>
bordering upon it, I have already observed that these countries contain various tribes, some of which possess a high degree of freedom, and others are altogether unacquainted with the restraints of government. The indolence and timidity peculiar to the inhabitants of the islands, render them so in∣capable of the sentiments or efforts necessary for maintaining independence, that there is no occa∣sion to search for any other cause of their tame sub∣mission to the will of a superior. The subjection of the Natchez, and of the people of Bogota, seems to have been the consequence of a difference in their state from that of the other Americans. They were settled nations, residing constantly in one place. Hunting was not the chief occupation of the former, and the latter seem hardly to have trusted to it for any part of their subsistence. Both had made such progress in agriculture and arts, that the idea of property was introduced in some degree in the one community, and fully established in the other. Among people in this state, avarice and ambition have acquired objects, and have begun to exert their power; views of interest allure the selfish; the desire of pre-eminence excites the enterprising; do∣minion is courted by both; and passions unknown to man in his savage state prompt the interested and ambitious to encroach on the rights of their fellow-citizens. Motives, with which rude nations are equally unacquainted, induce the people to submit tamely to the usurped authority of their superiors. But even among nations in this state, the spirit of subjects could not have been rendered so obsequi∣ous, or the power of rulers so unbounded without the intervention of superstition. By its fatal influ∣ence, the human mind, in every stage of its pro∣gress, is depressed, and its native vigour and inde∣pendence subdued. Whoever can acquire the di∣rection of this formidable engine, is secure of do∣minion

over his species. Unfortunately for the people whose institutions are the subject of enquiry, this power was in the hands of their chiefs. The caziques of the isles could put what responses they pleased into the mouths of their <HI>Cemis</HI> or gods; and it was by their interposition, and in their name, that they imposed any tribute or burden on their people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. iii. c. 3.</NOTE>. The same power and prerogative was exercised by the great chief of the Natchez as the principal minister as well as the representative of the Sun, their deity. The respect which the people of Bogota paid to their monarchs was likewise in∣spired by religion, and the heir apparent of the kingdom was educated in the innermost recess of their principal tempel, under such austere discipline, and with such peculiar rites, as tended to fill his subjects with high sentiments concerning the sanc∣tity of his character, and the dignity of his station<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Piedrahita, p. 27.</NOTE>. Thus superstition, which, in the rudest period of society, is either altogether unknown, or wastes its force in childish unmeaning practices, had acquired such an ascendant over those people of America, who had made some little progress towards refine∣ment, that it became the chief instrument of bend∣ing their minds to an untimely servitude, and sub∣jected them, in the beginning of their political ca∣reer, to a despotism hardly less rigorous than that which awaits nations in the last stage of their cor∣ruption and decline.</P>
<P N="5"><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their art of war.</NOTE>V. AFTER examining the political institutions of the rude nations in America, the next object of at∣tion is their art of war, or their provision for public security and defence. The small tribes dis∣persed over America are not only independent and unconnected, but engaged in perpetual hostilities
<PB N="381" REF="034476_0379_0FFDD805C06B19F8"/>
with one another<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ribas Hist. de los Triumph p▪ 9.</NOTE>. Though mostly strangers to the idea of separate property vested in any indivi∣dual, the rudest of the American nations are well acquainted with the rights of each community to its own domains. This right they hold to be per∣fect and exclusive, entitling the possessor to oppose the encroachment of neighbouring tribes. As it is of the utmost consequence to prevent them from destroying or disturbing the game in their hunting grounds, they guard this national property with a jealous attention. But as their territories are ex∣tensive, and the boundaries of them not exactly ascertained, innumerable subjects of dispute arise, which seldom terminate without bloodshed. Even in this simple and primitive state of society, interest is a source of discord, and often prompts savage tribes to take arms, in order to repel or punish such as encroach on the forests or plains, to which they trust for subsistence.</P>
<P>BUT interest is not either the most frequent or the most powerful motive of the incessant hostilities among rude nations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their mo∣tives for engaging in war.</NOTE> These must be imputed to the passion of revenge, which rages with such vio∣lence in the breast of savages, that eagerness to gratify it may be considered as the distinguishing characteristic of men in their uncivilized state. Circumstances of powerful influence, both in the interior government of rude tribes, and in their external operations against foreign enemies, concur in cherishing and adding strength to a passion fatal to the general tranquillity. When the right of re∣dressing his own wrongs is left in the hands of every individual, injuries are felt with exquisite sensibility, and vengeance exercised with unrelenting rancour. No time can obliterate the memory of an offence, and it is seldom that it can be expiated but by the
<PB N="382" REF="034476_0380_0FFDD80751B53BD0"/>
blood of the offender. In carrying on their public wars, savage nations are influenced by the same ideas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">From the spirit of vengeance.</NOTE> and animated with the same spirit, as in pro∣secuting private vengeance. In small communities, every man is touched with the injury or affront offered to the body of which he is a member, as if it were a personal attack upon his own honour or safety. The desire of revenge is communicated from breast to breast, and soon kindles into rage. As feeble societies can take the field only in small parties, each warrior is conscious of the importance of his own arm, and feels that to it is committed a considerable portion of the public vengeance. War, which between extensive kingdoms is carried on with little animosity, is prosecuted by small tribes with all the rancour of a private quarrel. The re∣sentment of nations is as implacable as that of indi∣viduals.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hence the ferocity of their wars,</NOTE> It may be dissembled or suppressed, but is never extinguished; and often, when least ex∣pected or dreaded, it bursts out with redoubled fury<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Boucher Hist.

When polished nations have obtained the glory of victory, or have acquired an addition of territory, they may terminate a war with honour.

This grows up with him as he ad∣vances in life; and as his attention is directed to few objects, it acquires a degree of force unknown among men, whose passions are dissipated and weakened by the variety of their occupations and pursuits. The desire of vengeance, which takes possession of the heart of savages, resembles the in∣stinctive rage of an animal, rather than the passion of a man. It turns with undiscerning fury, even against inanimate objects. If hurt accidentally by a stone, they often seize it in a transport of anger, and endeavour to wreak their vengeance upon it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lery ap. de Bry, iii. 100.</NOTE>. If struck with an arrow in a battle, they will tear it from the wound, break and bite it with their teeth, and dash it on the ground<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Lery ap. de Bry, iii 208.

He neither pities, nor forgives, nor spares.</P>
<P>THE force of this passion is so well understood by the Americans themselves, that they always apply to it, in order to excite their people to take arms. If the elders of any tribe attempt to rouze their youth from sloth, if a chief wishes to allure a band of warriors to follow him in invading an ene∣my's country, the most persuasive topics of their martial eloquence are drawn from revenge. "The bones of our countrymen," say they, "lie unco∣vered; their bloody bed has not been washed clean. Their spirits cry aginst us; they must be appeased. Let us go and devour the people by whom they were slain. Sit no longer inactive upon your mats;

A single warrior, prompted by ca∣price or revenge, will take the field alone, and march several hundred miles to surprise and cut off a straggling enemy<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXVI.</NOTE>. The exploits of a noted warrior, in such solitary excursions, often form the chief part in the history of an American cam∣paign<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXVII.</NOTE>; and their elders connive at such irregular sallies, as they tend to cherish a martial spirit, and accustom their people to enterprise and danger<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Bossu, i. 140. Lery ap. de Bry, 215. Hennepin Moeurs des Sauv. 41. Lafitau, ii. 169.</NOTE>. But when a war is national, and undertaken by public authority, the deliberations are formal and slow. The elders assemble, they deliver their opi∣nions in solemn speeches, they weigh with matu∣rity the nature of the enterprise, and balance its beneficial or disadvantageous consequences with no inconsiderable portion of political discernment or sagacity. Their priests and soothsayers are con∣sulted, and sometimes they ask the advice even of their women <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Charlev. Hist. N.

But no man is constrained to follow him; the reso∣lution of the community to commence hostilities, imposes no obligation upon any member to take

<P>THE maxims by which they regulate their mi∣litary operations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mode of carrying on war.</NOTE> though extremely different from those which take place among more civilized and populous nations, are well suited to their own po∣litical state, and the nature of the country in which they act. They never take the field in numerous bodies, as it would require a greater effort of fore∣sight and industry, than is usual among savages, to provide for their subsistence, during a march of some hundred miles through dreary forests, or dur∣ing a long voyage upon their lakes and rivers. Their armies are not incumbered with baggage or military stores. Each warrior, besides his arms, carries a mat and a small bag of pounded maize, and with these is completely equipped for any ser∣vice. While at a distance from the enemies fron∣tier, they disperse through the woods, and support themselves with the game which they kill, or the fish which they catch. As they approach nearer to the territories of the nation which they intend to attack, they collect their troops, and advance with greater caution. Even in their hottest and most active wars, they proceed wholly by stratagem and ambuscade. They place not their glory in attack∣ing their enemies with open force. To surprise and destroy is the greatest merit of a commander, and the highest pride of his followers. War and hunt∣ing are their only occupations, and they conduct both with the same spirit and the same arts. They follow the track of their enemies through the forest. They endeavour to discover their haunts, they lurk in some thicket near to these, and, with the patience of a sportsman lying in wait for game, will conti∣nue

in their station day after day, until they can rush upon their prey when most secure, and least able to resist them. If they meet no straggling part of the enemy, they advance towards their villages, but with such solicitude to conceal their own approach, that they often creep on their hands and feet through the woods, and paint their skins of the same colour with the withered leaves, in order to avoid detection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev.

If so fortunate as to remain unobserved, they set on fire the enemies huts in the dead of night, and massacre the inhabitants, as they fly naked and defenceless from the flames. If they hope to effect a retreat without being pursued, they carry off some prisoners, whom they reserve for a more dreadful fate. But if, notwithstanding all their address and precautions, they find that their motions are discovered, that the enemy has taken the alarm, and is prepared to oppose them, they usually deem it most prudent to retire. They regard it as extreme folly to meet an enemy who is on his guard, upon equal terms, or to give battle in an open field. The most distinguished success is a disgrace to a leader, if it has been purchased with any considerable loss of his followers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXVIII.</NOTE>; and they never boast of a victory, if stained with the blood of their own countrymen<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Charlev.

But when we reflect that many of these tribes, on occasions which call for extraordinary efforts, not only defend them∣selves with obstinate resolution, but attack their enemies with the most daring courage, and that they possess fortitude of mind superior to the sense of danger or the fear of death, we must ascribe their habitual caution to some other cause than con∣stitutional timidity<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lasitau Moeurs des Sauv. ii. 248, 249.

The number of men in each tribe is so small, the difficulty of rearing new mem∣bers, amidst the hardships and dangers of savage life, so great, that the life of a citizen is extremely precious, and the preservation of it becomes a ca∣pital object in their policy.

But wherever their communities are more populous, so that they can act with considerable force, and can sustain the loss of several of their members, without being sensibly weakened, the military operations of the Americans more nearly resemble those of other nations.

The fate of the pri∣soners remains still undecided. The old men deli∣berate concerning it. Some are destined to be tortured to death, in order to satiate the revenge of the conquerors; some to replace the members which the community has lost in that or former wars. They who are reserved for this milder fate, are led to the huts of those whose friends have been killed. The women meet them at the door, and if they receive them, their sufferings are at an end. They are adopted into the family, and, according to their phrase, are seated upon the mat of the de∣ceased. They assume his name, they hold the same rank, and are treated thenceforward with all the tenderness due to a father, a brother, husband, or a friend.

it. All who are present, men, women, and chil∣dren, rush upon them like furies. Every species of torture is applied that the rancour of revenge can invent. Some burn their limbs with red-hot irons, some mangle their bodies with knives, others tear their flesh from their bones, pluck out their nails by the roots, and rend and twist their sinews. They vie with one another in the refinements of tor∣ture. Nothing sets bounds to their rage but the dread of abridging the duration of their vengeance by hastening the death of the sufferers; and such is their cruel ingenuity in tormenting, that by avoid∣ing industriously to hurt any vital part, they often prolong this scene of anguish for several days. In spite of all that they suffer, the victims continue to chant their dead-song with a firm voice, they boast of their own exploits, they insult their tormentors for their want of skill in avenging their friends and relations, they warn them of the vengeance which awaits them on account of what they are now doing, and excite their ferocity by the most provoking re∣proaches and threats. To display undaunted forti∣tude in such dreadful situations, is the noblest tri∣umph of a warrior. To avoid the trial by a vo∣luntry death, or to shrink under it, is deemed in∣famous and cowardly.

Nor was the practice peculiar to rude unpolished tribes; the principle from which it took rise is so deeply rooted in the minds of the Americans, that it subsisted in Mexico, one of the civilized empires in the New World, and relics of it may be discovered among the more mild inha∣bitants of Peru. It was not scarcity of food, as some authors imagine, and the importunate crav∣ings of hunger, which forced the Americans to those horrid repasts on their fellow-creatures. Hu∣man flesh was never used as common food in any country, and the various relations concerning peo∣ple who reckoned it among the stated means of subsistence, flow from the credulity and mistakes of travellers.

They are feasted and ca∣ressed, and some beautiful young women are ap∣pointed to attend and solace them. It is not easy to account for this part of their conduct unless we impute it to a refinement in cruelty. For, while they seem studious to attach the captives to life, by supplying them with every enjoyment that can ren∣der it agreeable, their doom is irrevocably fixed. On a day appointed, the victorious tribe assembles, the prisoner is brought forth with great solemnity, he views the preparations for the sacrifice with as much indifference as if he himself were not the victim, and meeting his fate with undaunted firm∣ness, is dispatched with a single blow. The mo∣ment he falls, the women seize the body, and dress it for the feast.

<P>AS the constancy of every American warrior may be put to such severe proof, the great object of mi∣litary education and discipline in the New World is to form the mind to sustain it. When nations carry on war with open force, defy their enemies to the combat, and vanquish them by the superi∣ority
<PB N="395" REF="034476_0393_0FFDD829CF801808"/>
of their skill or courage, soldiers are trained to be active, vigorous, and enterprising. But in America, where the genius and maxims of war are extremely different, passive fortitude is the quality in highest estimation. Accordingly, it is early the study of the Americans to acquire sentiments and habits, which will enable them to behave like men, when their resolution shall be put to the proof. As the youth of other nations exercise themselves in feats of activity and force, those of America vie with one another in exhibitions of their patience under sufferings. They harden their nerves by those voluntary trials, and gradually accustom them∣selves to endure the sharpest pain, without com∣plaining. A boy and girl will bind their naked arms together, and place a burning coal between them, in order to try who first discovers such impatience as to shake it off.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlev. Hist. N. Fr. iii. 307.</NOTE> All the trials, customary in Ame∣rica, when a youth is admitted into the class of warriors, or when a warrior is promoted to the dignity of captain or chief, are accommodated to this idea of manliness. They are not displays of valour, but of patience; they are not exhibitions of their ability to offend, but of their capacity to suffer. Among the tribes on the banks of the Ori∣noco, if a warrior aspires to the rank of captain, his probation begins with a long fast, more rigid than any ever observed by the most abstemious hermit. At the close of this, the chiefs assemble, each gives him three lashes with a large whip, applied so vi∣gorously, that his body is almost flayed, and if he betrays the least symptom of impatience or even sensibility, he is disgraced for ever, and rejected as unworthy of the honour to which he aspires. After some interval, the constancy of the candidate is proved by a more excruciating trial. He is laid
<PB N="396" REF="034476_0394_0FFDD82B841AA0F0"/>
in a hammoc with his hands bound fast, and an in∣numerable multitude of venomous ants, whose bite occasions exquisite pain, and produces a violent inflammation, are thrown upon him. The judges of his merit stand around the hammoc, and, while these cruel insects fasten upon the most sensible parts of his body, a sigh, a groan, an involuntary motion expressive of what he suffers, would exclude him for ever from the rank of captain. Even after this evidence of his fortitude, it is not deemed to be completely ascertained, but must stand another test, more dreadful than any he has hitherto undergone. He is again suspended in his hammoc, and covered with leaves of the palmetto. A fire of stinking herbs is kindled underneath, so as he may feel its heat, and be involved in its smoke. Though scorched and almost suffocated, he must continue to endure with the same patient insensibility. Many perish in this rude essay of their firmness and cou∣rage, but such as go through it with applause, re∣ceive the ensigns of their new dignity with much solemnity, and are ever after regarded as leaders of approved resolution, whose behaviour, in the most trying situations will do honour to their country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gumilla, ii 286, &amp;c. Biet. 376, &amp;c.</NOTE>. In North America, the previous trial of a warrior is neither so formal nor so severe. Though even there, before a youth is permitted to bear arms, his patience and fortitude are proved by blows, by fire, and by insults, more intolerable to a haughty spirit than both<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlev. Hist. N. Fr. iii. 219.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE amazing steadiness with which the Ame∣ricans endure the most exquisite torments, has in∣duced some authors to suppose that, from the pe∣culiar feebleness of their frame, their sensibility is not so acute as that of other people; as women,
<PB N="397" REF="034476_0395_0FFDD8302A37C8F8"/>
and persons of a relaxed habit, are observed to be less affected with pain than robust men, whose nerves are more firmly braced. But the consti∣tution of the Americans is not so different, in its texture, from that of the rest of the human species, as to account for this diversity in their behaviour. It flows from a principle of honour, instilled early and cultivated with such care, as to inspire man in his rudest state with an heroic magnanimity, to which philosophy hath endeavoured, in vain, to form him, when more highly improved and polish∣ed. This invincible constancy he has been taught to consider as the chief distinction of a man, and the highest attainment of a warrior. The ideas which influence his conduct, and the passions which take possession of his heart, are few. They ope∣rate of course with more decisive effect, than when the mind is crowded with a multiplicity of objects, or distracted by the variety of its pursuits; and when every motive that acts with any force in form∣ing the sentiments of a savage, prompts him to suffer with dignity, he will bear what might seem to be impossible for human patience to sustain. But wherever the fortitude of the Americans is not roused to exertion by their ideas of honour, their feelings of pain are the same with those of the rest of mankind<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXV.</NOTE>. Nor is that patience under suffer∣ings for which the Americans have been so justly celebrated, an universal attainment. The constancy of many of the victims is overcome by the agonies of torture. Their weakness and lamentations com∣plete the triumph of their enemies, and reflect dis∣grace upon their own country<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlev. Hist. N. Fr. iii. 248.385.

Even in seasons of public tranquillity, their imper∣fect industry does not supply them with any super∣fluous store of provisions;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wasted by their per∣petual wars.</NOTE> but when the irruption of an enemy desolates their cultivated lands, or disturbs them in their hunting excursions, such a calamity reduces a community, naturally unprovi∣dent and destitute of resources, to extreme want. All the people of the district that is invaded, are frequently forced to take refuge in woods or moun∣tains, which can afford them little subsistence, and where many of them perish. Notwithstanding their excessive caution in conducting their military operations, and the solicitude of every leader to preserve the lives of his followers, as the rude tribes in America seldom enjoy any interval of peace, the loss of men among them is considerable in propor∣tion to the degree of population. Thus famine and the sword combine in thinning their numbers. All their communities are feeble, and nothing now re∣mains of several nations, which were once consider∣able, but the name<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev. Hist. N. Fr. iii. 202, 203.429.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Recruit their num∣bers by adopting prisoners.</NOTE>SENSIBLE of this continual decay, there are tribes which endeavour to recruit their national force when exhausted, by adopting prisoners taken in war, and by this expedient prevent their total extinction. The practice, however, is not univer∣sally received. Resentment operates more power∣fully among savages, than considerations of policy. Far the greater part of their captives was anciently sacrificed to their vengeance, and it is only since their numbers began to decline fast, that they have generally adopted milder maxims. But such as they do naturalize, renounce for ever their native tribe, and assume the manners as well as passions of the people by whom they are adopted<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlev. Hist. N. Fr. iii. 245, &amp;c. Lafit. ii. 308.</NOTE>, so entirely,
<PB N="399" REF="034476_0397_0FFDD8348BD63A48"/>
that they often join them in expeditions against their own countrymen. Such a sudden transition, and so repugnant to one of the most powerful instincts implanted by nature, would be deemed strange among many people; but among the members of small communities, where national enmity is vio∣lent and deep-rooted, it has the appearance of being still more unaccountable. It seems, however, to result naturally from the principles upon which war is carried on in America. When nations aim at exterminating their enemies, no exchange of pri∣soners can ever take place. From the moment one is made a prisoner, his country and his friends con∣sider him as dead<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXVI.</NOTE>. He has incurred indeliable disgrace by suffering himself to be surprised or to be taken by an enemy; and were he to return home, after such a stain upon his honour, his nearest relations would not receive or even acknowledge that they knew him<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lahont. ii. 185, 186.</NOTE>. Some tribes were still more rigid, and if a prisoner returned, the infamy which he had brought on his country was expiated, by putting him instantly to death<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. iv. c. 16. p. 173.</NOTE>. As the unfortu∣nate captive is thus an outcast from his own coun∣try, and the ties which bound him to it are irrepa∣rably broken, he feels less reluctance in forming a new connection with people, who, as an evidence of their friendly sentiments, not only deliver him from a cruel death, but offer to admit him to all the rights of a fellow-citizen. The perfect simi∣larity of manners among savage nations facilitates and completes the union, and induces a captive to transfer not only his allegiance, but his affection, to the community into the bosom of which he is re∣ceived.</P>

When the people of Europe over∣ran the various provinces of America, this supe∣riority was still more conspicuous. Neither the courage nor number of the natives could repel a handful of invaders.

As under a mild climate there was little need of any defence from the inju∣ries of the air, and their extreme indolence shun∣ned every species of labour to which it was not urged by absolute necessity, all the inhabitants of the isles, and a considerable part of the people on the continent, remained in this state of naked sim∣plicity. Others were satisfied with some slight co∣vering, such as decency required. But though naked, they were not unadorned. They dressed their hair in many different forms. They fastened bits of gold, or shells, or shining stones, in their ears, their noses, and cheeks<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Lery ap. de Bry, iii. 165. Lettr. Edifiantes, 20.223.</NOTE>. They stained their skins with a great variety of figures; and they spent much time, and submitted to great pain, in ornamenting their persons in this fantastic manner. Vanity, however, which finds endless occupation for ingenuity and invention, in nations where dress has become a complex and intricate art, is circum∣scribed within so narrow bounds, and confined to so few articles among naked savages, that they are not satisfied with those simple decorations, and have a wonderful propensity to alter the natural form of their bodies, in order to render it (as they imagine) more perfect and beautiful. This practice was uni∣versal among the rudest of the American tribes. Their operations for that purpose begin as soon as an infant is born.

Whatever relates only to peaceable and inactive life, he views with indiffer∣ence. Hence, though finically attentive to dress, he is little solicitous about the elegance or disposi∣tion of his habitation. Savage nations, far from that state of improvement, in which the mode of living is considered as a mark of distinction, and unacquainted with those wants, which require a variety of accommodation, regulate the construc∣tion of their houses according to their limited ideas of necessity. Some of the American tribes were so extremely rude, and had advanced so little beyond the primeval simplicity of nature, that they had no houses at all. During the day, they take shelter from the scorching rays of the sun under thick trees; at night they form a shed with their branches and leaves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXX.</NOTE>.

essays of the rudest Americans towards providing themselves with habitations. But even among tribes which are more improved, and whose resi∣dence is become altogether fixed, the structure of their houses is extremely mean and simple. They are wretched huts, sometimes of an oblong and sometimes of a circular form, intended merely for shelter, with no view to elegance, and little atten∣tion to conveniency. The doors are so low, that it is necessary to bend or to creep on the hands and feet in order to enter them. They are without windows, and have a large hole in the middle of the roof, to convey out the smoke. To follow travellers in other minute circumstances of their description, is not only beneath the dignity of his∣tory, but would be foreign to the object of my re∣searches. One circumstance merits attention, as it is singular, and illustrates the character of the peo∣ple. Some of their houses are so large as to con∣tain accommodation for fourscore or a hundred persons. These are built for the reception of dif∣ferent families, which dwell together under the same roof<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXXI.</NOTE>, and often around a common fire, without separate apartments, or any kind of screen or par∣tition between the spaces which they respectively occupy. As soon as men have acquired distinct ideas of property; or when they are so much at∣tached to their females, as to watch them with care and jealousy; families of course divide and settle in separate houses, where they can secure and guard whatever they wish to preserve. This singular mod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f habitation among several people of Ame∣rica, may therefore be considered not only as the effect of their imperfect notions concerning pro∣perty, but as a proof of inattention and indifference towards their women. If they had not been accus∣tomed

to perfect equality, such an arrangement could not have taken place. If their sensibility had been apt to have taken alarm, they would not have trusted the virtue of their women amidst the temp∣tations and opportunities of such a promiscuous in∣tercourse. At the same time, the perpetual con∣cord which reigns in habitations where so many families are crouded together, is surprising, and affords a striking evidence that they must be people of either a very gentle, or of a very phlegmatic temper, who, in such a situation, are unacquainted with animosity, brawling, and discord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Journ. de Grillet &amp; Bechamel dans la Goyane, p. 65.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their arms.</NOTE>AFTER making some provision for his dress and habitation, a savage will perceive the necessity of preparing proper arms with which to assault or repel an enemy. This, accordingly, has early ex∣ercised the ingenuity and invention of all rude nations. The first offensive weapons were doubtless such as chance presented, and the first efforts of art to improve upon these, were extremely simple and awkward. Clubs made of some heavy woods, stakes hardened in the fire, lances whose heads were armed with flint or the bones of some animal, are weapons known to the rudest nations. All these, however, were of use only in close encoun∣ter. But men wished to annoy their enemies while at a distance, and the bow and arrow is the most early invention for this purpose. This wea∣pon is in the hands of people, whose advances in improvement are extremely inconsiderable, and is familiar to the inhabitants of every quarter of the globe. It is remarkable, however, that some tribes in America were so destitute of art and ingenuity, that they had not attained <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the discovery of this

Even in operations which seem the most interesting, and where the most powerful motives urge them to vi∣gorous exertions, they labour with a languid list∣lessness.

The slightest manual operation consumes an amazing length of time, and what in polished nations would hardly be an effort of industry, is among savages an arduous undertaking. This slow∣ness of the Americans in executing works of every kind may be imputed to various causes. Among savages, who do not depend for subsistence upon the efforts of regular industry, time is of so little importance, that they set no value upon it; and provided they can finish a design, they never re∣gard how long they are employed about it. The tools which they employ are so aukward and defec∣tive, that every work in which they engage must necessarily be tedious. The hand of the most in∣dustrious and skilful artist, were it furnished with no better instrument than a stone hatchet, a shell, or the bone of some animal, would find it difficult to perfect the most simple work. It is by length of labour, that he must endeavour to supply his defect of power. But above all, the cold phlegmatic temper peculiar to the Americans render their ope∣rations languid.

them from that habitual indolence in which they are sunk; and unless when engaged in war or hunting, they seem incapable of exerting any vigorous effort. Their ardour of application is not so great as to call forth that inventive spirit which suggests expedients for facilitating and abridging labour. They will return to a task day after day, but all their methods of executing it are tedious and operose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXXVI.</NOTE>. Even since the Europeans have communicated to them the knowledge of their instruments, and taught them to imitate their arts, the peculiar genius of the Americans is conspicuous in every attempt they make.

Priests and missionaries are the persons who have had the best opportunities of carrying on this inquiry, among the most un∣civilized of the American tribes. Their minds, engrossed by the doctrines of their own religion, and habituated to its institutions, are apt to disco∣ver something which resembles those objects of their veneration, in the opinions and rites of every people. Whatever they contemplate, they view
<PB N="411" REF="034476_0409_0FFDD851CFE3D348"/>
through one medium, and draw and accommodate it to their own system. They study to reconcile the institutions, which fall under their observation, to their own creed, not to explain them according to the rude notions of the people themselves. They ascribe to them ideas which they are incapable of forming, and suppose them to be acquainted with principles and facts, which it is impossible that they should know. Hence, some missionaries have been induced to believe, that even among the most bar∣barous nations in America, they had discovered traces, no less distinct than amazing, of their ac∣quaintance with the sublime mysteries and peculiar instiututions of Christianity. From their own inter∣pretation of certain expressions and ceremonies, they have concluded that these people had some knowledge of the doctrine of the Trinity, of the incarnation of the Son of God, of his expiatory sa∣crifice, of the virtue of the cross, and of the efficacy of the sacraments<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Venegas, i. 88.92.

<P>BUT, even when we make our choice of conduc∣tors, with the greatest care, we must not follow them with implicit faith. An inquiry into the reli∣gious notions of rude nations is involved in pecu∣liar intricacies, and we must often pause in order to separate the facts which our informers relate, from the reasonings with which they are accompa∣nied, or the theories which they build upon them. Several pious writers, more attentive to the im∣portance of the subject than to the condition of the people whose sentiments they were endeavour∣ing to discover, have bestowed much unprofitable labour in researches of this nature<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXXVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="412" REF="034476_0410_0FFDD8548A36BF00"/>THERE are two fundamental doctrines, upon which the whole system of religion, as far as it can be discovered by the light of nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Confined to two ar∣ticles.</NOTE> is established. The one respects the being of a God, the other the immortality of the soul. To discover the ideas of the uncultivated nations under our review with regard to those important points, is not only an object of curiosity, but may afford instruction. To these two articles I shall confine my researches, leaving subordinate opinions, and the detail of local superstitions, to more minute inquirers. Whoever has had any opportunity of examining into the religious opinions of persons in the in∣ferior ranks of life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The being o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> God.</NOTE> even in the most enlightened and civilized nations, will find that their system of belief is derived from instruction, not discovered by inquiry. That numerous part of the human species, whose lot is labour, whose principal and almost sole occupation is to secure subsistence, views the arrangement and operations of nature with little reflection, and has neither leisure nor ca∣pacity for entering into that path of refined and in∣tricate speculation which conducts to the knowledge of the principles of natural religion. In the early and most rude periods of savage life, such disquisi∣tions are altogether unknown. When the intellec∣tual powers are just beginning to unfold, and their lust feeble exertions are directed towards a few ob∣jects of primary necessity and use; when the faculties of the mind are so limited, as not to have formed abstract or general ideas; when language is so bar∣ren, as to be destitute of names to distinguish any thing that is not perceived by some of the senses; it is preposterous to expect that man should be ca∣pable of tracing with accuracy the relation between cause and effect; or to suppose that he should rise from the contemplation of the one to the knowledge of the other, and form just conceptions of a Deity,
<PB N="413" REF="034476_0411_0FFDD8564C1C1130"/>
as the Creator and Governor of the universe. The idea of creation is so familiar wherever the mind is enlarged by science, and illuminated with revelation, that we seld<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> reflect how profound and abstruse this idea is, or consider what progress man must have made in observation and research, before he could arrive at any knowledge of this elementary principle in religion. Accordingly, several tribes have been discovered in America, which have no idea whatever of a Supreme Being, and no rites of religious worship. Inattentive to that magnificent spectacle of beauty and order presented to their view, unaccustomed to reflect either upon what they themselves are, or to inquire who is the author of their existence, men, in their savage state, pass their days like the animals round them, without knowledge or veneration of any superior power. Some rude tribes have not in their language any name for the Deity, nor have the most accurate ob∣servers been able to discover any practice or insti∣tution which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>med to imply that they recognised his authority, or were solicitous to obtain his favour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Biet, 539.

<P>BUT the human mind, formed for religion, soon opens to the reception of ideas, which are destined,
<PB N="414" REF="034476_0412_0FFDD85AFA411600"/>
when corrected and refined, to be the great source of consolation amidst the calamities of life. Among some of the American tribes, still in the infancy of improvement, we discern apprehensions of some in∣visible and powerful beings. These apprehensions are originally indistinct and perplexed, and seem to be suggested rather by the dread of impending evils, than to flow from gratitude for blessings re∣ceived. While Nature holds on her course with uniform and undisturbed regularity, men enjoy the benefits resulting from it, without inquiring con∣cerning its cause. But every deviation from this regular course rouses and astonishes them. When they behold events to which they are not accus∣tomed, they search for the reasons of them with eager curiosity. Their understanding is unable to penetrate into these; but imagination, a more for∣ward and ardent faculty of the mind, decides with∣out hesitation. It ascribes the extraordinary occur∣rences in nature to the influence of invisible beings, and supposes that the thunder, the hurricane, and the earthquake, are effects of their interposition. Some such confused notion of spiritual or invisible power, superintending over those natural calamities which frequently desolate the earth, and terrify its inhabitants, may be traced among many rude na∣tions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXXIX.</NOTE>. But besides this, the disasters and dangers of savage life are so many, and men often find them∣selves in situations so formidable, that the mind, sensible of its own weakness, has no resource but in the guidance and protection of wisdom and power superior to what is human. Dejected with cala∣mities which oppress him, and exposed to dangers which he cannot repel, the savage no longer relies upon himself; he feels his own impotence, and sees no prospect of being extricated, but by the interpo∣sition
<PB N="415" REF="034476_0413_0FFDD85C8E573038"/>
of some unseen arm. Hence, in all unen∣lightened nations, the first rites or practices which bear any resemblance to acts of religion, have it for their object to avert evils which men suffer or dread. The <HI>Manitous</HI> or <HI>Okkis</HI> of the North Americans were amulets or charms, which they imagined to be of such virtue, as to preserve the persons who reposed confidence in them from every disastrous event, or they were considered as tutelary spirits, whose aid they might implore in circumstances of distress<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 343, &amp;c. Creuxii Hist. Canad. p. 82, &amp;c.</NOTE>.

P. Martyr, decad. p. 102. &amp;c.</NOTE>. Even among those tribes whose religious system was more enlarged, and who had formed some conception of benevolent beings, which delighted in conferring benefits, as well as of malicious powers prone to inflict evil; superstition still ap∣pears as the offspring of fear, and all its efforts were employed to avert calamities. They were persuaded that their good deities, prompted by the beneficence of their nature, would bestow every blessing in their power, without solicitation or ac∣knowledgment; and their only anxiety was to soothe and deprecate the wrath of the powers whom they regarded as the enemies of mankind<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Tertre, ii. 365.

Were we to trace back the ideas of other nations to that rude state in which history first presents them to our view, we should discover a surprising resemblance in their tenets and practices; and should be convinced, that, in simi∣lar circumstances, the faculties of the human mind hold nearly the same course in their progress, and arrive at almost the same conclusions.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Remarka∣ble diversi∣ty in their religious notions.</NOTE>BUT, among other tribes, which have been longer united, or have made greater progress in improvement, we discern some feeble pointing to∣wards more just and adequate conceptions of the power that presides in nature.

But these ideas are faint and confused, and when they attempt to explain them, it is manifest, that among them the word <HI>spirit</HI> has a meaning very different from that in which we employ it, and that they have no con∣ception of any deity but what is corporeal. They believe their gods to be of the human form, though of a nature more excellent than man, and retail such wild incoherent fables concerning their func∣tions and operations, as are altogether unworthy of

a place in history. Even among these tribes, there is no established form of public worship; there are no temples erected in honour of their deities; and no ministers peculiarly consecrated to their service. They have the knowledge, however, of several su∣perstitious ceremonies and practices handed down to them by tradition, and to these they have re∣course with a childish credulity, when roused by any emergence from their usual insensibility, and excited to acknowledge the power, and to implore the protection of superior beings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev.

<P>THE tribe of the Natchez,<NOTE PLACE="marg">System of the Nat∣chez.</NOTE> and the people of Bogota had advanced beyond the other unculti∣vated nations of America in their ideas of religion, as well as in their political institutions; and it is no less difficult to explain the cause of this distinction than of that which we have already considered. The Sun was the chief object of religious worship among the Natchez. In their temples, which were constructed with some magnificence, and decorated with various ornaments, according to their mode of architecture, they preserved a perpetual fire, as the purest emblem of their divinity. Ministers were appointed to watch and feed this sacred flame. The first function of the great chief of the nation, every morning, was an act of obeisance to the Sun; and festivals returned at stated seasons, which were celebrated by the whole community with solemn but unbloody rites<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Dumont, i. 158, &amp;c. Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 417, &amp;c. 429, Lafitau, i. 67.</NOTE>. This is the most refined species of superstition known in America, and, per∣haps, one of the most natural as well as most se∣ducing. The Sun is the apparent source of the joy, fertility, and life, diffused through nature; and while the human mind, in its early essays to∣wards
<PB N="418" REF="034476_0416_0FFDD86390C847A8"/>
inquiry, contemplates and admires his uni∣versal and animating energy, its admiration is apt to stop short at what is visible, without reaching to the unseen cause; and pays that adoration to the most glorious and beneficial work of God, which is due only to him who formed it. As fire is the purest and most active of the elements, and in some of its qualities and effects resembles the Sun, it was, not improperly, chosen to be the emblem of his powerful operation. The ancient Persians, a people far superior, in every respect, to that rude tribe whose rites I am describing, founded their re∣ligious system on similar principles, and established a form of public worship, less gross and exception∣able than any people destitute of guidance from revelation. This surprising co-incidence in sen∣timent between two nations, in such different states of improvement, is one of the many singular and unaccountable circumstances which occur in the his∣tory of human affairs.</P>
<P>AMONG the people of Bogota, the Sun and Moon were, likewise, the chief objects of venera∣tion. Their system of religion was more regular and complete, though less pure, than that of the Natchez. They had temples, altars, priests, sacri∣fices, and that long train of ceremonies, which su∣perstition introduces wherever she has fully established her dominions over the minds of men. But the rites of their worship were cruel and bloody. They of∣fered human victims to their deities, and many of their practices nearly resembled the barbarous insti∣tutions of the Mexicans, the genius of which we shall have an opportunity of considering more atten∣tively in its proper place<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Piedrahita, Conq. del N.

<P>WITH respect to the other great doctrine of re∣ligion,

This sen∣timent, resulting from a secret consciousness of its own dignity, from an instinctive longing after immor∣tality, is universal, and may be deemed natural. Upon this, are founded the most exalted hopes of man in his highest state of improvement; nor has nature withheld from him this soothing con∣solation, in the most early and rude period of its progress. We can trace this opinion from one extremity of America to the other: in some re∣gions more faint and obscure, in others more per∣fectly developed, but no where unknown. The most uncivilized of its savage tribes do not appre∣hend death as the extinction of being. All enter∣tain hopes of a future and more happy state, where they shall be for ever exempt from the calamities which embitter human life in its present condition. This future state they conceive to be a delightful country, blessed with perpetual spring, whose fo∣rests abound with game, whose rivers swarm with fish, where famine is never felt, and uninterrupted plenty shall be enjoyed without labour or toil. But as men, in forming their first imperfect ideas concerning the invisible world, suppose that there they shall continue to feel the same desires, and to be engaged in the same occupations, as in the pre∣sent world; they naturally ascribe eminence and distinction, in that state, to the same qualities and talents which are here the object of their esteem. The Americans, accordingly, allotted the highest place, in their country of spirits, to the skilful hun∣ter, to the adventrous and successful warrior, and to such as had tortured the greatest number of cap∣tives,

<P><PB N="421" REF="034476_0419_0FFDD86BD379A438"/>AMONG the Americans, as well as other unci∣vilized nations, many of the rites and observances which bear some resemblance to acts of religion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Supersti∣tion con∣nected with devotion.</NOTE> have no connection with devotion, but proceed from a fond desire of prying into futurity. The human mind is most apt to feel, and to discover this vain curiosity, when its own powers are most feeble and uninformed.

Alarmed at events of which it cannot discern the issue or the conse∣quences, it has recourse to other means of discover∣ing them, than the exercise of its own sagacity. Wherever superstition is so established as to form a regular system, this desire of penetrating into the secrets or futurity is connected with it. Divination becomes a religious act. Priests, as the ministers of Heaven, pretend to deliver its oracles to men. They are the only soothsayers, augurs, and magici∣ans, who profess the sacred and important art of dis∣closing what is hid from other eyes.</P>

As the diseases of men in the savage state, are (as have been already observed) like those of the animal creation, few but extremely violent, their impatience under what they suffer, and solicitude for the recovery of health, soon inspired them with extraordinary reverence for such as pretended to understand the nature of their mala∣dies, and to be possessed of knowledge sufficient to preserve or deliver them from their sudden and fatal effects. These ignorant pretenders, however, were such utter strangers to the structure of the hu∣man

frame, as to be equally unacquainted with the causes of its disorders, and the manner in which they will terminate. Superstition, mingled fre∣quently with some portion of craft, supplied what they wanted in science. They imputed the origin of diseases to supernatural influence, and prescribed or performed a variety of mysterious rites, which they gave out to be of such efficacy as to remove the most dangerous and inveterate maladies. The credulity and love of the marvellous, natural to uninformed men, favoured the deception, and pre∣pared them to be the dupes of those impostors. Among savages, their first physicians are a kind of conjurers or wizards, who boast that they know what is past, and can foretel what is to come. In∣cantations, sorcery, and mummeries of diverse kinds, no less strange than frivolous, are the means which they employ to expel the imaginary causes of malignity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P. Melch. Hernandez, Memorial de Chiriqui. Collect. Orig. Pap. i.</NOTE>; and relying upon the efficacy of these, they predict with confidence what will be the fate of their deluded patients. Thus superstition, in its earliest form, flowed from the solicitude of man to be delivered from present distress, not from his dread of evils awaiting him in a future life, and was originally ingrafted on medicine, not on religion. One of the first, and most intelligent historians of America, was struck with this alliance between the art of divination and that of physic, among the people of Hispaniola<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>do, lib. v. c. i.</NOTE>.

As their function led them to apply to the human mind

when enfeebled by sickness, and as they found it, in that season of dejection, prone to be alarmed with imaginary fears, or amused with vain hopes, they easily induced it to rely with implicit confidence in the virtue of their spells, and the certainty of their predictions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. i. lib. iii. c. 4.

<P>WHENEVER men acknowledge the reality of su∣pernatural power and discernment in one instance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gradually extends.</NOTE> they have a propensity to admit it in others. The Americans did not long suppose the efficacy of con∣juration to be confined to one subject. They had recourse to it in every situation of danger or distress. When the events of war were peculiarly disastrous, when they met with unforeseen disap∣pointments in hunting, when inundations or drought threatened their crops with destruction, they called upon their conjurers to begin their incantations, in order to discover the causes of those calamities, or to foretell what would be their issue<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 3. Dumont, i. 173. Fernand. Relac. de los Chiquit. p. 40. Lozano, 84. Margrave, 279.</NOTE>. Their con∣fidence in this delusive art gradually increased, and manifested itself in all the occurrences of life. When involved in any difficulty, or about to enter upon any transaction of moment, every individual regularly consulted the sorcerer, and depended upon his instructions to extricate him from the former, as well as to direct his conduct in the latter. Even among the rudest tribes in America, superstition appears in this form, and divination is an art in high esteem. Long before man had acquired such knowledge of the Deity as inspires reverence, and leads to adoration, we observe him stretching out a presumptuous hand to draw aside that veil with
<PB N="424" REF="034476_0422_0FFDD874C4EFEE68"/>
which Providence kindly conceals its purposes from human knowledge; and we find him labouring, with fruitless anxiety, to penetrate into the myste∣ries of the divine administration. To discern, and to worship a superintending power, is an evidence of the enlargement and maturity of the human understanding; a vain desire of prying into futu∣rity, is the error of is infancy, and a proof of its weakness.</P>
<P>FROM this weakness proceeded likewise the faith of the Americans in dreams, their observation of omens, their attention to the chirping of birds, and the cries of animals, all which they suppose to be indications of future events, and if any one of these prognostics is deemed unfavourable, they in∣stantly abandon the pursuit of those measures on which they are most eagerly bent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Love of dancing.</NOTE>AMONG savages, in every part of the globe, the love of dancing is a favourite passion. As, during a great part of their time, they languish in a state of inactivity and indolence, without any occupation to rouse or interest them, they delight universally in a pastime which calls forth the active powers of their nature into exercise. The Spaniards, when they first visited America, were astonished at the fondness of the natives for dancing, and beheld with wonder a people, cold and unanimated in most

of their other pursuits, kindle into life, and exert themselves with ardour, as often as this favourite amusement recurred. Among them, indeed, danc∣ing ought not to be denominated an amusement. It is a serious and important occupation, which mingles in every occurrence of public or private life. If any intercourse be necessary between two American tribes, the ambassadors of the one ap∣proach in a solemn dance, and present the calumet or emblem of peace; the sachems of the other re∣ceive it with the same ceremony<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De la Potherie Hist. ii. 17, &amp;c.

Gomara, Hist. Gen. c. 196.</NOTE>, they have dances appropriated to each of these situations, and suited to the different sentiments with which they are then animated. If a person is indisposed, a dance is prescribed as the most effectual means of restoring him to health; and if he himself cannot endure the fatigue of such an exercise, the physician or conjurer performs it in his name, as if the virtue of his activity could be transferred to his patient<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Denys Hist. Nat. 189. Brickell, 372. De la Potherie, ii. 36.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ALL their dances are imitations of some action; and though the music by which they are regulated is extremely simple and tiresome to the ear by its dull monotony, some of their dances appear won∣derfully expressive and animated. The war dance is, perhaps the most striking. It is the represent∣ation of a complete American campaign. The
<PB N="426" REF="034476_0424_0FFDD8792C5AC068"/>
departure of the warriors from their village, their march into the enemy's country, the caution with which they encamp, the address with which they station some of their party in ambush, the manner of surprising the enemy, the noise and ferocity of the combat, the scalping of those who are slain, the seizing of prisoners, the triumphant return of the conquerors, and the torture of the victims, are successively exhibited. The performers enter with such enthusiastic ardour into their several parts, their gestures, their countenance, their voice, are so wild and so well adapted to their various situa∣tions, that Europeans can hardly believe it to be a mimic scene, or view it without emotions of fear and horror<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De la Potherie, ii. 116. Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 297. Lafi∣tau, i. 523.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT however expressive some of the American dances may be, there is one circumstance in them remarkable, and connected with the character of the race. The songs, the dances, the amusements of other nations, expressive of the sentiments which animate their hearts, are often adapted to display or excite that sensibility which mutually attaches the sexes. Among some people, such is the ardour of this passion, that love is almost the sole object of festivity and joy; and as rude nations are strangers to delicacy, and unaccustomed to dis∣guise any emotion of their minds, their dances are often extremely wanton and indecent. Such is the Calenda, of which the natives of Africa are so pas∣sionately fond<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Adanson, Voyage to Senegal, p. iii. 287. Labat, Voyages, iv. 463. Sloane, Hist. Nat. of Jam.

But, among the Americans, more cold and indifferent to their females, from
<PB N="427" REF="034476_0425_0FFDD87CCCC3A3A0"/>
causes which I have already explained, the passion of love mingles but little with their festivals and pastimes. Their songs and dances are mostly so∣lemn and martial, they are connected with some of the serious and important affairs of life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Descript. of N. France.

If, on some occasions, the women are permited to join in the festival, the character of the entertainment is still the same, and no movement or gesture is expressive of attachment, or encourages familiarity<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Barrere, Fr. Equin. p. 191.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AN immoderate love of play,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Passion for gaming,</NOTE> especially at games of hazard, which seems to be natural to all people unaccustomed to the occupations of regular indus∣try, is likewise universal among the Americans. The same causes, which so often prompt persons in civilized life, who are at their ease, to have re∣course to this pastime, render it the delight of the savage. The former are independent of labour, the latter do not feel the necessity of it; and as both are unemployed, they run with transport to what∣ever is interesting enough to stir and to agitate their minds. Hence the Americans, who at other times are so indifferent, so phlegmatic, so silent, and animated with so few desires, as soon as they en∣gage in play become rapacious, impatient, noisy, and almost frantic with eagerness. Their furs, their domestic utensils, their clothes, their arms, are staked at the gaming-table, and when all is lost, high as their sense of independence is, in a wild emotion of despair or hope, they will often risk
<PB N="428" REF="034476_0426_0FFDD87F64ECE180"/>
their personal liberty upon a single cast<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 261. 318. Lafitau. ii. 338, &amp;c. Ribas, Triumf. 13. Brickell, 335.</NOTE>. Among several tribes, such gaming parties frequently recur, and become their most acceptable entertainment at every great festival. Superstition, which is apt to take hold of those passions which are most vigorous, frequently lends its aid to confirm and strengthen this favourite inclination. Their conjurers are ac∣customed to prescribe a solemn match at play, as one of the most efficacious methods of appeasing their gods, or of restoring the sick to health<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 262.</NOTE></P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and for drinking.</NOTE>FROM causes similar to those which render them fond of play, the Americans are extremely addicted to drunkenness. It seems to have been one of the first exertions of human ingenuity to discover some composition of an intoxicating quality; and there is hardly any nation so rude, or so destitute of inven∣tion, as not to have succeeded in this fatal research. The most barbarous of the American tribes have been so unfortunate as to attain this art; and even those which are so deficient in knowledge, as to be unacquainted with the method of giving an inebri∣ating strength to liquors by fermentation, can ac∣complish the same end by other means. The people of the islands of North America, and of California, used, for this purpose, the smoke of tobacco, drawn up with a certain instrument into the nostrils, the fumes of which ascending to the brain, they felt all the transports and frenzy of in∣toxication<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Oviedo, Hist. ap Ramus. iii. 113. Venegas, i. 68. Naufrag. de Cabeca de Vaca, cap. 26. See NOTE XCII.</NOTE>. In almost every other part of the New World, the natives possessed the art of ex∣tracting an intoxicating liquor from maize or the manioc root, the same substances which they con∣vert into bread. The operation by which they
<PB N="429" REF="034476_0427_0FFDD8820A1AEA00"/>
effect this, nearly resembles the common one of brewing, but with this difference, that in place of yest, they use a nauseous infusion of a certain quan∣tity of maize or manioc chewed by their women. The saliva excites a vigorous fermentation, and in a few days the liquor becomes fit for drinking. It is not disagreeable to the taste, and when swallowed in large quantities, is of an intoxicating quality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Stadius ap. de Bry, iii. 111. Lery, ibid. 175.</NOTE>. This is the general beverage of the Americans, which they distinguish by various names, and for which they feel such a violent and insatiable desire, as it is not easy either to conceive or describe. Among polished nations, where a succession of va∣rious functions and amusements keeps the mind in continual occupation, the desire for strong drink is regulated, in a great measure, by the climate, and increases or diminishes according to the variations of its temperature. In warm regions, the delicate and sensible frame of the inhabitants does not require the stimulation of fermented liquors. In colder countries, the constitution of the natives, more ro∣bust and more sluggish, stands in need of generous liquors to quicken and animate it. But among sa∣vages, the desire of something that is of power to intoxicate, is in every situation the same. All the people of America, if we except some small tribes near the Straits of Magellan, whether natives of the torrid zone, or inhabitants of its more temperate regions, or placed by a harder fate in the severe cli∣mates towards its northren or southern extremity, appear to be equally under the dominion of this appetite<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gumilla, i. 257.

Such a similarity of taste, among people in such different situations, must be ascribed to the
<PB N="430" REF="034476_0428_0FFDD884A1555EF8"/>
influence of some moral cause, and cannot be con∣sidered as the effect of any physical or constitutional want. While engaged in war or in the chase, the savage is often in the most interesting situations, and all the powers of his nature are roused to the most vigorous exertions. But those animating scenes are succeeded by long intervals of repose, during which the warrior meets with nothing that he deems of sufficient dignity or importance to merit his attention. He languishes and mopes in this sea∣son of indolence. The posture of his body is an emblem of the state of his mind. In one climate, cowering over the fire in his cabin; in another, stretched under the shade of some tree, he doses away his time in sleep, or in an unthinking joyless inactivity, not far removed from it. As strong liquors awake him from this torpid state, give a brisker motion to his spirits, and enliven him more thoroughly than either dancing or gaming, his love of them is excessive. A savage, when not engaged in action, is a pensive melancholy animal; but as soon as he tastes, or has a prospect of tasting, the intoxicating draught, he becomes gay and frolic∣some<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Melendez Tesorez Verd<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d, iii 369.</NOTE>. Whatever be the occasion or pretext on which the Americans assemble, the meeting always terminates in a debauch. Many of their festivals have no other object, and they welcome the return of them with transports of joy. As they are not accustomed to retain any appetite, they set no bounds to this. The riot often continues without intermission several days; and whatever may be the fatal effects of their excess, they never cease from drinking as long as one drop of liquor remains. The persons of greatest eminence, the most dis∣tinguished warriors, and the chiefs most renowned for their wisdom, have no greater command of
<PB N="431" REF="034476_0429_0FFDD88738DC32B8"/>
themselves than the most obscure member of the community. Their eagerness for present enjoy∣ment renders them blind to its fatal consequences; and those very men, who, in other situations, seem to possess a force of mind more than human, are in this instance inferior to children in foresight, as well as consideration, and mere slaves of brutal appetite<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ribas, 9.

<P>BUT, amidst this wild debauch, there is one cir∣cumstance remarkable; the women, in most of the American tribes, are not permitted to partake of it<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XCIII.</NOTE>. Their province is to prepare the liquor, to serve it about to the guests, and to take care of their husbands and friends, when their reason is overpowered. This exclusion of the women from an enjoyment so highly valued by savages, may be justly considered as a mark of their inferiority, and as an additional evidence of that contempt with which they were treated in the New World. The people of North America, when first discovered, were not acquainted with any intoxicating drink; but as the Europeans early found it their interest to supply them with spiritous liquors, drunken∣ness soon became as universal among them as among their countrymen to the south; and their women having acquited this new taste, indulge it with as little decency and moderation as the men<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Hutchinson, Hist. of Massachus. 469. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>tau, ii. 125.

<PB N="432" REF="034476_0430_0FFDD889E6C5D7A0"/>
in America; but I cannot omit one seemingly as singular as any that has been mentioned. When their parents and other relations become old,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Put to death the aged and incurable.</NOTE> or labour under any distemper which their slender knowledge of the healing art cannot remove, the Americans cut short their days with a violent hand, in order to be relieved from the burden of support∣ing and tending them. This practice prevailed among the ruder tribes in every part of the conti∣nent, from Hudson's Bay to the river De la Plata; and however shocking it may be to those sentiments of tenderness and attachment, which, in civilized life, we are apt to consider as congenial with our frame, the condition of man in the savage state leads and reconciles him to it. The same hardships and difficulty of procuring subsistence, which deter savages, in some cases, from rearing their children, prompt them to destroy the aged and infirm. The declining state of the one is as helpless as the in∣fancy of the other. The former are no less unable than the latter to perform the functions that belong to a warrior or hunter, or to endure those various distresses in which savages are so often involved, by their own want of foresight and industry. Their relations feel this, and, incapable of attending to the wants or weaknesses of others, their impatience under an additional burden prompts them to ex∣tinguish that life which they find it difficult to sus∣tain. This is not regarded as a deed of cruelty, but as an act of mercy. An American, broken with years and infirmities, conscious that he can no longer depend on the aid of those around him, places himself contentedly in his grave; and it is by the hands of his children or nearest relations that the thong is pulled, or the blow inflicted, which releases him for ever from the sorrows of life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cassani Histor. de N.

AFTER contemplating the rude American tribes in such various lights, after taking a view of their customs and manners from so many dif∣ferent stations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">General es∣timate of their cha∣racter.</NOTE> nothing remains but to form a ge∣neral estimate of their character, compared with that of more polished nations. A human being, as he comes originally from the hand of nature, is every where the same. At his first appearance in the state of infancy, whether it be among the rudest savages, or in the most civilized nation, we can discern no quality which marks any distinction or superiority. The capacity of improvement seems to be the same; and the talents he may afterwards acquire, as well as the virtues he may be rendered capable of exercising, depend, in a great measure, upon the state of society in which he is placed. To this state his mind naturally accommodates it∣self, and from it receives discipline and culture. In proportion to the wants which it accustoms a human being to feel, and the functions in which these engage him, his intellectual powers are called forth. According to the connections which it esta∣blishes between him and the rest of his species, the affections of his heart are exerted. It is only by attending to this great principle, that we can dis∣cover what is the character of man in every different period of his progress.</P>
<P>IF we apply it to savage life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Intellectual powers.</NOTE> and measure the at∣tainments of the human mind in that state by this standard, we shall find, according to an observation which I have already made, that the intellectual powers of man must be extremely limited in their operations. They are confined within the narrow sphere of what he deems necessary for supplying his own wants. Whatever has not some relation to these, neither attracts his attention, nor is the object of his enquiries. But however narrow the bounds may be within which the knowledge of a
<PB N="434" REF="034476_0432_0FFDD89031001910"/>
savage is circumscribed, he possesses thoroughly that small portion which he has attained. It was not communicated to him by formal instruction; he does not attend to it as a matter of mere specu∣lation and curiosity; it is the result of his own ob∣servation, the fruit of his own experience, and accommodated to his own condition and exigencies. While employed in the active occupations of war or of hunting, he often finds himself in difficult and perilous situations, from which the efforts of his own sagacity must extricate him. He is frequently engaged in measures, where every step depends upon his own ability to decide, where he must rely solely upon his own penetration to discern the dan∣gers to which he is exposed, and upon his own wis∣dom in providing against them. In consequence of this, he feels the knowledge which he possesses, and the efforts which he makes, and either in deli∣beration or action rests on himself alone.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Political talents.</NOTE>AS the talents of individuals are exercised and improved by such exertions, much political wisdom is said to be displayed in conducting the affairs of their small communities. The council of old men in an American tribe, deliberating upon its interests, and determining with respect to peace or war, has been compared to the senate in more polished re∣publics. The proceedings of the former, we are told, are often no less formal and sagacious, than those of the latter. Great political wisdom is exhi∣bited in pondering the various measures proposed, and in balancing their probable advantages, against the evils of which they may be productive. Much address and eloquence are employed by the leaders, who aspire at acquiring such confidence with their countrymen, as to have an ascendant in those assem∣blies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 269, &amp;c.</NOTE>. But, among savage tribes, the field for
<PB N="435" REF="034476_0433_0FFDD891C5041690"/>
displaying political talents cannot be extensive. Where the idea of private property is incomplete, and no criminal jurisdiction is established, there is hardly any function of internal government to exer∣cise. Where there is no commerce, and scarcely any intercourse among separate tribes; where enmity is implacable, and hostilities are carried on almost without intermission, there will be few points of public concern to adjust with their neighbours; and that department of their affairs which may be deno∣minated foreign, cannot be so intricate as to require much refined policy in conducting it. Where in∣dividuals are so thoughtless and improvident as seldom to take effectual precautions for self-pre∣servation, it is vain to expect that public measures and deliberations will be regulated by the contem∣plation of remote events. It is the genius of sa∣vages to act from the impulse of present passion. They have neither foresight nor temper to form complicated arrangements with respect to their future conduct. The consultations of the Ameri∣cans, indeed, are so frequent, and their negociations are so many<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XCIV.</NOTE>, and so long protracted, as to give their proceedings an extraordinary aspect of wis∣dom. But this is not owing so much to the depth of their schemes, as to the coldness and phlegm of their temper, which render them slow in deter∣mining<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 271.</NOTE>. If we accept the celebrated league, that united the Five Nations in Canada into a federal republic, which shall be considered in its proper place, we can discern few such traces of political wisdom, among the rude American tribes, as dis∣cover any great degree of foresight or extent of in∣tellectual abilities. Even among them, we shall find public measures more frequently directed by the impetuous ferocity of their youth, than regu∣lated

by the experience and wisdom of their old men.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Degree of affection.</NOTE>AS the condition of man in the savage state is unfavourable to the progress of the understanding, it has a tendency likewise, in some respects to check the exercise of affection, and to render the heart contracted. The strongest feeling in the mind of a savage is a sense of his own independ∣ence. He has sacrificed so small a portion of his natural liberty by becoming a member of society, that he remains, in a great degree, the sole master of his own actions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fernandez Mission. de los Chiquit. 33.</NOTE>. He often takes his resolu∣tions alone, without consulting, or feeling any con∣nection with the persons around him. In many of his operations, he stands as much detached from the rest of his species, as if he had formed no union with them. Conscious how little he depends upon other men, he is apt to view them with a careless indifference. Even the force of his mind contri∣butes to increase this unconcern, and as he looks not beyond himself in deliberating with respect to the part which he should act, his solicitude about the consequences of it seldom extends farther. He pursues his own career, and indulges his own fancy, without enquiring or regarding whether what he does be agreeable or offensive to others, whether they may derive benefit or receive hurt from it. Hence the ungovernable caprice of savages, their impatience under any species of restraint, their in∣ability to suppress or moderate any inclination, the scorn or neglect with which they receive advice, their high estimation of themselves, and their con∣tempt of other men. Among them, the pride of independence produces almost the same effects with interestedness in a more advanced state of society; it refers every thing to a man himself, it leads him
<PB N="437" REF="034476_0435_0FFDD89705974A28"/>
to be indifferent about the manner in which his actions may affect other men, and renders the gra∣tification of his own wishes the measure and end of conduct.</P>
<P>TO the same cause may be imputed the hardness of heart, and insensibility,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hardness of heart.</NOTE> remarkable in all savage nations. Their minds, roused only by strong emotions, are little susceptible of gentle, delicate, or tender affections<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 309.</NOTE>. Their union is so incom∣plete, that each individual acts as if he retained all his natural rights entire and undiminished. If a favour is conferred upon him, or any beneficial ser∣vice is performed on his account, he receives it with much satisfaction, because it contributes to his enjoyment; but this sentiment extends not beyond himself, it excites no sense of obligation, he neither feels gratitude, nor thinks of making any return<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Oviedo, Hist. lib. xvi. c. 2. See NOTE XCV.</NOTE>. Even among persons the most closely connected, the exchange of those good offices which strengthen attachment, mollify the heart, and sweeten the in∣tercourse of life, is not frequent. The high ideas of independence among the Americans nourish a sullen reserve, which keeps them at a distance from each other. The nearest relations are mutually afraid to make any demand, or to solicit any ser∣vice<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">De la Potherie, iii. 28.</NOTE>, lest it should be considered by the other as imposing a burden, or laying a restraint upon his will.</P>
<P>I HAVE already remarked the influence of this hard unfeeling temper upon domestic life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insensibi∣lity.</NOTE> with re∣spect to the connection between husband and wife, as well as that between parents and children. Its effects are no less conspicuous, in the performance of those mutual offices of tenderness which the in∣firmities

of our nature frequently exact. Among some tribes, when any of their number are seized with any violent disease, they are generally aban∣doned by all around them, who, careless of their recovery, fly in the utmost conste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nation from the supposed danger of infection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lettre de P.

But even where they are not thus deserted, the cold indifference with which they are attended can afford them little consolation. No look of sympathy, no soothing expressions, no officious services, contribute to al∣leviate the distress of the sufferers, or to make them forget what they endure<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gumilla, i. 329. Lozano, 100.</NOTE>. Their nearest re∣lations will often refuse to submit to the smallest inconveniency, or to part with the least trifle, how∣ever much it may tend to their accommodation or relief.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Garcia Origen, &amp;c. 90. Herrera, dec. 4. lib. viii. c. 5.</NOTE> So little is the breast of a savage suscepti∣ble of those sentiments which prompt men to that feeling attention which mitigates the calamities of human life, that, in some provinces of America, the Spaniards have found it necessary to enforce the common duties of humanity by positive laws, and to oblige husbands and wives, parents and children, under severe penalties, to take care of each other during their sickness<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Cogulludo Hist. de Yucatan, p. 300.</NOTE>. The same harshness of temper is still more conspicuous in their treatment of all the animal creation. Prior to their intercourse with the people of Europe, the North Americans had some tame dogs, which accompanied them in their hunting excursions, and served them with all the ardour and fidelity peculiar to the species. But, instead of that fond attachment which the hunter naturally feels towards those useful companions of
<PB N="439" REF="034476_0437_0FFDD8A3614768C0"/>
his toils, they requite their services with neglect, seldom feed, and never caress them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 119, 337.</NOTE>. In other provinces, the Americans have become acquainted with the domestic animals of Europe, and avail themselves of their service; but it is universally observed that they always treat them harshly<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ulloa Notic. American. 312.</NOTE>, and never employ any method, either for breaking or managing them, but force and cruelty. In every part of the deportment of man in his savage state, whether towards his equals of the human species, or towards the animals below him, we recognize the same character, and trace the operations of a mind intent on its own gratifications, and regu∣lated by its own caprice, with little attention or sen∣sibility to the sentiments and feelings of the beings around him.</P>
<P>AFTER explaining how unfavourable the savage state is to the cultivation of the understanding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Taciturnity</NOTE> and to the improvement of the heart, I should not have thought it necessary to mention what may be deemed its lesser defects, if the character of nations, as well as of individuals, were not often more dis∣tinctly marked by circumstances apparently trivial than by those of greater moment. A savage, fre∣quently placed in situations of danger and distress, depending on himself alone, and wrapt up in his own thoughts and schemes, is a serious melancholy animal. His attention to others is small. The range of his own ideas is narrow. Hence that taci∣turnity which is so disgusting to men accustomed to the open intercourse of social conversation. When they are not engaged in action, the Americans often sit whole days in one posture, without open∣ing their lips<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Bouguer, 102.</NOTE>. When they go forth to war, or to
<PB N="440" REF="034476_0438_0FFDD8ABEF13F4C8"/>
the chase, they usually march in a line at some dis∣tance from one another, and without exchanging a word. The same profound silence is observed when they row together in a canoe<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev. iii. 340.</NOTE>. It is only when they are animated by intoxicating liquors, or rouzed by the jollity of the festival and dance, that they become gay and conversible.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Cunning.</NOTE>TO the same causes may be imputed the refined cunning with which they form and execute their schemes. Men, who are not habituated to a liberal communication of their own sentiments and wishes, are apt to be so distrustful, as to place little confi∣dence in others, and to have recourse to an insidi∣ous craft in accomplishing their own purposes. In civilized life, those persons, who, by their situa∣tion, have but a few objects of pursuit on which their minds incessantly dwell, are most remarkable for low artifice in carrying on their little projects. Among savages, whose views are equally confined, and their attention no less persevering, those cir∣cumstances must operate still more powerfully, and gradually accustom them to a disingenuous subtlety in all their transactions. The force of this is in∣creased by habits which they acquire in carrying on the two most interesting operations wherein they are engaged. With them war is a system of craft, in which they trust for success to stratagem more than to open force, and have their invention conti∣nually on the stretch to circumvent and surprise their enemies. As hunters, it is their constant ob∣ject to ensnare, in order that they may destroy. Accordingly, art and cunning have been universally observed as distinguishing characteristics of all sa∣vages. The people of the rude tribes of America are remarkable for their artifice and duplicity. Im∣penetrably secret in forming their measures, they
<PB N="441" REF="034476_0439_0FFDD8B227F337F8"/>
pursue them with a patient undeviating attention, and there is no refinement of dissimulation which they cannot employ, in order to insure success. The natives of Peru were engaged above thirty years, in concerting the plan of that insurrection which took place under the vice-royalty of the marquis de Villa Garcia; and though it was com∣municated to a great number of persons in all dif∣ferent ranks, no indication of it ever transpired during that long period; no man betrayed his trust, or by an unguarded look, or rash word, gave rise to any suspicion of what was intended <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voyage de Ulloa, ii. 309.</NOTE>. The dis∣simulation and craft of individuals is no less remark∣able than that of nations. When set upon deceiv∣ing, they wrap themselves up so artificially, that it is impossible to penetrate into their intentions, or to detect their designs<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gumilla, i. 162. Charlev. iii. 109.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT if there be defects or vices peculiar to the savage state,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Virtues.</NOTE> there are likewise virtues which it in∣spires, and good qualities, to the exercise of which it is friendly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Indepen∣dent spirit.</NOTE> The bonds of society sit so loose upon the members of the more rude American tribes, that they hardly feel any restraint. Hence the spirit of independence, which is the pride of a savage, and which he considers as the unalienable prerogative of man. Incapable of controul, and disdaining to acknowledge any superior, his mind, though limited in its powers, and erring in many of its pursuits, acquires such elevation by the conscious∣ness of its own freedom, that he acts on some occa∣sions with astonishing force, and perseverance, and dignity.</P>
<P>AS independence nourishes this high spirit among savages,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fortitude.</NOTE> the perpetual wars in which they are en∣gaged call it forth into action. Such long intervals of tranquillity as are frequent in polished societies
<PB N="442" REF="034476_0440_0FFDD8B4D53371C8"/>
are unknown in the savage state. Their enmities, as I have observed, are implacable and immortal. The valour of the young men is never allowed to rust in inaction. The hatchet is always in their hand, either for attack or defence. Even in their hunting excursions, they must be on their guard against surprise from the hostile tribes, by which they are surrounded. Accustomed to continual alarms, they grow familiar with danger; courage becomes an habitual virtue, resulting naturally from their situation, and strengthened by constant exer∣tions. The mode of displaying fortitude may not be the same in small and rude communities, as in more powerful and civilized states. Their system of war, and standard of valour, may be formed upon different principles, but in no situation does the human mind rise more superior to the sense of danger, or the dread of death, than in its most sim∣ple and uncultivated state.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attach∣ment t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE>ANOTHER virtue remarkable among savages, is attachment to the community of which they are members. From the nature of their political union, one might expect this tie to be extremely feeble. But there are circumstances which render the influ∣ence, even of their loose mode of association, very powerful. The American tribes are small; com∣bined against their neighbours, in prosecution of ancient enemies, or in avenging recent injuries, their interests and operations are neither numerous nor complex. These are objects, which the un∣cultivated understanding of a savage can compre∣hend. His heart is capable of forming connections, which are so little diffused. He assents with warmth to public measures, dictated by passions similar to those which direct his own conduct. Hence the ardour with which individuals undertake the most perilous service, when the community deems it ne∣cessary. Hence their fierce and deep-rooted anti∣pathy
<PB N="443" REF="034476_0441_0FFDD8B66C042C58"/>
to the public enemies. Hence their zeal for the honour of their tribe, and that love of their country, which prompts them to brave danger that it may triumph, and to endure the most exquisite torments, without a groan, that it may not be disgraced.</P>
<P>THUS,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Satisfaction with their own condi∣tion.</NOTE> in every situation where a human being can be placed, even the most unfavourable, there are virtues which peculiarly belong to it; there are af∣fections which it calls forth; there is a species of hap∣piness which it yields. Nature, with most benefi∣cent intention, conciliates and forms the mind to its condition; the ideas and wishes of man extend not beyond that state of society to which he is habituated. What it presents as objects of contemplation or enjoyment, fills and satisfies his mind, and he can hardly conceive any other mode of life to be plea∣sant, or even tolerable. The Tartar, accustomed to roam over extensive plains, and to subsist on the product of his herds, imprecates upon his enemy, as the greatest of all curses, that he may be con∣demned to reside in one place, and to be nourished with the top of a weed. The rude Americans, fond of their own pursuits, and satisfied with their own lot, are equally unable to comprehend the in∣tention or utility of the various accommodations, which, in more polished society, are deemed essen∣tial to the comfort of life. Far from complaining of their own situation, or viewing that of men in a more improved state with admiration or envy, they regard themselves as the standard of excel∣lence, as beings the best entitled, as well as the most perfectly qualified, to enjoy real happiness. Unaccustomed to any restraint upon their will or their actions, they behold with amazement the in∣equality of rank, and the subordination which take place in civilized life, and consider the voluntary submission of one man to another, as a renunciation,
<PB N="444" REF="034476_0442_0FFDD8BB12F0D0E0"/>
no less base than unaccountable, of the first distinc∣tion of humanity. Void of foresight, as well as free from care themselves, and delighted with that state of indolent security, they wonder at the anxious precautions, the unceasing industry, and compli∣cated arrangements of Europeans, in guarding against distant evils, or providing for future wants; and they often exclaim against their preposterous folly, in thus multiplying the troubles, and in∣creasing the labour of life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 308. Lahontan, ii. 97.</NOTE>. This preference of their own manners is conspicuous on every oc∣casion. Even the names by which the various nations wish to be distinguished, are assumed from this idea of their own pre-eminence. The ap∣pellation which the Iroquois give to themselves is, <HI>the chief of men</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Colden, i. 3.</NOTE>. <HI>Caraibe,</HI> the original name of the fierce inhabitants of the Windward Islands, signifies <HI>the warlike people</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rochefort Hist. des Antilles, 455.</NOTE>. The Chero∣kees, from an idea of their own superiority, call the Europeans <HI>Nothings,</HI> or <HI>the accursed race,</HI> and assume to themselves the name of <HI>the beloved people</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Adair, Hist. of Amer. Indians, p. 32.</NOTE>. The same principle regulated the notions of the other Americans concerning the Europeans; for although, at first, they were filled with astonish∣ment at their arts, and with dread of their power, they soon came to abate their estimation of men, whose maxims of life were so different from their own. Hence they called them the froth of the sea, men without father or mother. They supposed, that either they had no country of their own, and therefore invaded that which belonged to others<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Benzon. Hist. Novi Orbis, lib. iii. c. 21.</NOTE>; or that, being destitute of the necessaries of life at home, they were obliged to roam over the ocean, in order to rob such as were more amply provided.</P>
<P><PB N="445" REF="034476_0443_0FFDD8BCA3AADC00"/>MEN, thus satisfied with their condition, are far from any inclination to relinquish their own habits, or to adopt those of civilized life. The transition is too violent to be suddenly made. Even where endeavours have been used to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>an a savage from his own customs, and to render the accommoda∣tions of polished society familiar to him; even where he has been allowed to taste of those pleasures, and has been honoured with those distinctions, which are the chief objects of our desire, he droops and languishes under the restraint of laws and forms, he seizes the first opportunity of breaking loose from them, and returns with transport to the forest or the wild, where he can enjoy a careless and uncon∣trouled freedom <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Charlev. N. Fr. iii. 322.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS I have finished a laborious delineation of the character and manners of the uncivilized tribes scattered over the vast continent of America. In this, I aspire not at rivalling the great masters who have painted and adorned savage life, either in bold∣ness of design, or in the glow and beauty of their colouring. I am satisfied with the more humble merit of having persisted with patient industry, in viewing my subjects in many various lights, and collecting from the most accurate observers such detached, and often minute features, as might enable me to exhibit a portrait that resembles the original.</P>
<P>BEFORE I close this part of my work,<NOTE PLACE="marg">General caution with respect to this en∣quiry.</NOTE> one ob∣servation more is necessary, in order to justify the conclusions which I have formed, or to prevent the mistakes into which such as examine them may fall. In contemplating the inhabitants of a country so widely extended as America, great attention should be paid to the diversity of climates under which they are placed. The influence of this I
<PB N="446" REF="034476_0444_0FFDD8AF9150A9B8"/>
have pointed out with respect to several important particulars, which have been the object of research; but even where it has not been mentioned, it ought not to be overlooked. The provinces of America are of such different temperament, that this alone is sufficient to constitute a distinction between their inhabitants. In every part of the earth where man exists, the power of climate operates, with decisive influence, upon his condition and character. In those countries which approach near to the extremes of heat or cold, this influence is so conspicuous as to strike every eye. Whether we consider man merely as an animal, or as being endowed with rational powers which fit him for activity and spe∣culation, we shall find that he has uniformly at∣tained the greatest perfection of which his nature is capable, in the temperate regions of the globe. There his constitution is most vigorous, his organs most acute, and his form most beautiful. There, too, he possesses a superior extent of capacity, greater fertility of imagination, more enterprising courage, and a sensibility of heart which gives birth to desires, not only ardent, but persevering. In this favourite situation he has displayed the utmost efforts of his genius, in literature, in policy, in com∣merce, in war, and in all the arts which improve or embellish life <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Ferguson's Essay on the Hist. of Civil Society, part iii. c. 1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS powerful operation of climate, is felt most sensibly by rude nations, and produces greater ef∣fects than in societies more improved. The talents of civilized men are continually exerted in render∣ing their own condition more comfortable; and by their ingenuity and inventions, they can, in a great measure, supply the defects, and guard against the inconveniencies of any climate. But the improvi∣dent
<PB N="447" REF="034476_0445_0FFDD8BE382E9568"/>
savage is affected by every circumstance pe∣culiar to his situation. He takes no precaution ei∣ther to mitigate or to improve it. Like a plant, or an animal, he is formed by the climate under which he is placed, and feels the full force of its influence.</P>
<P>IN surveying the rude nations of America, this natural distinction between the inhabitants of the temperate and torrid zones is very remarkable. They may, accordingly, be divided into two great classes. The one comprehends all the North Americans, from the river St. Laurence to the Gulf of Mexico, together with the people of Chili, and a few small tribes towards the extremity of the southern continent. To the other belong all the inhabitants of the islands, and those settled in the various provinces which extend from the isthmus of Darien almost to the southern confines of Brasil, along the east side of the Andes. In the former, which comprehends all the regions of the tem∣perate zone that in America are inhabited, the human species appears manifestly to be more per∣fect. The natives are more robust, more active, more intelligent, and more courageous. They possess, in the most eminent degree, that force of mind, and love of independence, which I have pointed out as the chief virtues of man in his sa∣vage state. They have defended their liberty with persevering fortitude against the Europeans, who subdued the other rude nations of America with the greatest ease. The natives of the temperate zone are the only people in the New World who are indebted for their freedom to their own valour. The North Americans, though long encompassed by three formidable European powers, still retain part of their original possessions, and continue to exist as independent nations. The people of Chili, though early invaded, still maintain a gallant con∣test
<PB N="448" REF="034476_0446_0FFDD8C0E6FBB0C8"/>
with the Spaniards, and have set bounds to their encroachments; whereas, in the warmer re∣gions, men are more feeble in their frame, less vi∣gorous in the efforts of their mind, of a gentle but dastardly spirit, more enslaved by pleasure, and more sunk in indolence. Accordingly, it is in the torrid zone that the Europeans have most com∣pletely established their dominion over America; the most fertile and desirable provinces in it are subjected to their yoke; and if several tribes there still enjoy independence, it is either because they have never been attacked by an enemy already sa∣tiated with conquest, and possessed of larger terri∣tories than he was able to occupy, or because they have been saved from oppression by their remote and inaccessible situation.</P>
<P>CONSPICUOUS as this distinction may appear be∣tween the inhabitants of those different regions, it is not, however, universal. Moral and political causes, as I have formerly observed, affect the dis∣position and character of individuals as well as nations, still more powerfully than the influence of climate. There are, accordingly, some tribes, in various parts of the torrid zone, possessed of cou∣rage, high spirit, and the love of independence, in a degree hardly inferior to the natives of more temperate climates. We are too little acquainted with the history of those people, to be able to trace the several circumstances in their progress and con∣dition, to which they are indebted for this remark∣able pre-eminence. The fact, nevertheless, is cer∣tain. As early as the first voyage of Columbus, he received information that several of the islands were inhabited by the <HI>Caribbees,</HI> a fierce race of men, no wise resembling their feeble and timid neigh∣bours. In his second expedition to the New World he found his information to be just, and was himself a witness of their intrepid va∣lour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Life of Columbus, c. 47, 48. See NOTE XCVI.</NOTE>.
<PB N="449" REF="034476_0447_0FFDD8C4914572A0"/>
The same character they have maintained invariably in all subsequent contests with the people of Europe<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rochefort Hist. des Antilles, 531.</NOTE>; and, even in our own times, we have seen them make a gallant stand in defence of the last territory which the rapacity of their invaders had left in their possession <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XCVII.</NOTE>. Some nations in Brasil were no less eminent for vigiour of mind, and bra∣very in war<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Lery ap. de Bry, iii. 207, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The people of the isthmus of Da∣rien boldly met the Spaniards in the field, and fre∣quently repelled those formidable invaders<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1. lib. x. c. 15, &amp;c; dec. 2. passim.</NOTE>. Other instances might be produced. It is not attending to any single cause or principle, how powerful and extensive soever its influence may appear, that we can explain the actions, or account for the charac∣ter of men. Even the law of climate, more uni∣versal, perhaps, in its operation than any that affects the human species, cannot be applied, in judging of their conduct, without many exceptions.</P>

<P>THE Periplus Hannonis is the only authentic monument of the Carthaginian skill in naval affairs, and one of the most curious fragments transmitted to us by antiquity. The learned and industrious Mr. Dodwell, in a dissertation prefixed to the Periplus of Hanno, in the edition of the Minor Geographers published at Oxford, endeavours to prove that this is a spurious work, the composition of some Greek, who assumed Hanno's name. But M. de Montesquieu, in his l'Esprit des Loix, liv. xxi. c. 8. and M. de Bougainville, in a dissertation published, tom. xxvi. of the Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions, &amp;c. have established its authenticity by arguments which to me appear unanswerable.

It appears that Hanno, according to the mode of ancient navigation, under∣took this voyage in small vessels, so constructed, that he could keep close in with the coast. He sailed from Gades to the island of Cerne in twelve days. This is probably what is known to the moderns by the name of the isle of Arguim. It became the chief station of the Carthaginians on that coast; and M. de Bouganville contends, that the cisterns found there are monu∣ments of the Carthaginian power and ingenuity. Proceeding from Cerne, and still following the winding of the coast, he ar∣rived, in seventeen days, at a promontory which he called <HI>The West Horn,</HI> probably Cape Palmas. From this he advanced to another promontory, which he named <HI>The South Horn,</HI> and which is manifestly Cape de T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es Puntas, about five degrees north of the line. All the circumstances contained in the short ab∣stract of his journal, which is handed down, to us, concerning the appearance and state of the countries on the coast of Africa, are confirmed and illustrated by a comparison with the accounts of modern navigators. Even those circumstances, which, from their seeming improbability, have been produced to invalidate the credibility of his relation, tend to confirm it. He observes, that in the country to the south of Cerne, a profound silence reigned through the day; but during the night innumerable fires were kindled along the banks of the rivers, and the air resound∣ed with the noise of pipes and drums, and cries of joy. The same thing, as Ramusio observes, still takes place. The exces∣sive heat obliges the negroes to take shelter in the woods, or in their houses, during the day. As soon as the sun sets, they sally out, and by torch-light enjoy the pleasure of music and dancing, in which they spend the night. Ramus. i. 113. F. In another place, he mentions the sea as burning with torrents of fire. What occurred to M Adanson, on the same coast, may ex∣plain this: "As soon," says he, "as the sun dipped beneath the horizon, and night overspread the earth with darkness, the sea lent us its friendly light. While the prow of our vessel ploughed the soaming surges, it seemed to set them all on fire. Thus we sailed in a luminous inclosure, which surrounded us like a large circle of rays, from whence darted in the wake of the ship a long stream of light." Voy. to Senegal, p. 176. This appearance of the sea observed by Hunter, has been mentioned as an argument against the authenticity of the Periplus. It is, however, a phenomenon very common in warm climates. Capt.

<P>LONG after the navigation of the Phenicians and of Eu∣doxus round Africa, Polybius, the most intelligent and best informed historian of antiquity, and particularly distinguished by his attention to geographical researches, affirms, that it was not known, in his time, whether Africa was a continued con∣tinent, stretching to the south, or whether it was encompassed by the sea. Polybii Hist. lib. iii. Pliny the naturalist asserts, that there can be no communication between the southern and northern temperate zones. Plini. Hist. Natur. Edit. in usum Delph. 4to. lib. ii. c. 68. If they had given full credit to the accounts of those voyages, the former could not have entertained such a doubt, the latter could not have delivered such an opinion. Strabo mentions the voyage of Eudoxus, but treats it as a fa∣bulous tale, lib ii. p. 155; and, according to his account of it, no other judgment can be formed with respect to it. Strabo seems not to have known any thing with certainty concerning the form and state of the southern parts of Africa. Geogr. lib. xvii. p. 1180. Ptolemy, the most inquisitive and learned of all the ancient geographers, was equally unacquainted with any part of Africa situated a few degrees beyond the equinoctial line; for he supposes that this great continent was not surrounded by the sea, but that it stretched, without interruption, towards the south pole: and he so far mistakes its true figure, that he describes the continent as becoming broader and broader as it advanced towards the south.

<P>A FACT, recorded by Strabo, affords a very strong and singular proof of the ignorance of the ancients with respect to the situation of the various parts of the earth. When Alex∣ander marched along the banks of the Hydaspes and Acesine, two of the rivers which fall into the Indus, he observed that there were many crocodiles in those rivers, and that the country produced beans of the same species with those which were com∣mon in Egypt. From these circumstances, he concluded that he had discovered the source of the Nile, and prepared a fleet to sail down the Hydaspes to Egypt. Strab. Geogr. lib. xv. p. 1020. This amazing error did not arise from any ignorance of geography peculiar to that monarch; for we are informed by Strabo, that Alexander applied with particular attention in order to acquire the knowledge

<P>IT is probable that the ancients were seldom induced to ad∣vance so far as the mouth of the Ganges, either by motives of curiosity, or views of commercial advantage. In consequence of this, their idea concerning the position of that great river was very erroneous. Ptolemy places that branch of the Ganges which he distinguishes by the name of the Great Mouth, in the hundred and forty-sixth degree of longitude from his first meridian in the Fortunate Islands. But its true longitude, computed from that meridian, is now determined by astronomical observations to be only a hundred and five degrees. A geographer so eminent, must have been betrayed into an error of this magnitude by the imper∣fection of the information which he had received concerning those distant regions; and this affords a striking proof of the intercourse with them being extremely rare. With respect to the countries of India along the Ganges, his intelligence was still more defec∣tive, and his errors more enormous. I shall have occasion to ob∣serve in another place, that he has placed the country of the Seres, or China, no less than sixty degrees farther east than its true po∣sition. M d'Anville, one of the most learned and intelligent of the modern geographers, has set this matter in a clear light, in two dissertations published in Mem. de l'Academ. des Inscript. &amp;c. tom. xxxii. p. 573, 604.</P>

<P>IT is remarkable, that the discoveries of the ancients were made chiefly by land; those of the moderns are carried on chiefly by sea. The progress of conquest led to the former, that of commerce to the latter. It is a judicious observation of Strabo, that the conquests of Alexander the Great made known the East, those of the Romans opened the West, and those of Mithridates

When it is carried on only by sea, its sphere may be more extensive, and its advances more rapid; but it la∣bours under peculiar defects. Though it may make known the position of different countries, and ascertain their boundaries as far as these are determined by the ocean, it leaves us in igno∣rance with respect to their interior state. Above two centuries and a half have elapsed since the Europeans sailed round the southern promontory of Africa, and have traded in most of its ports; but, in a considerable part of that great continent, they have done little more than survey its coasts, and mark its capes and harbours. Its interior regions are in a great measure un∣known. The ancients, who had a very imperfect knowledge of its coasts, except where they are washed by the Mediterranean or Red Sea, were accustomed to penetrate into its inland provin∣ces, and, if we may rely on the testimony of Herodotus and Dio∣dorus Siculus, had explored many parts of it now altogether un∣known. Unless both modes of discovery be united, the geogra∣phical knowledge of the earth must remain incomplete and inac∣curate.</P>

<P>THE notion of the ancients concerning such an excessive degree of heat in the torrid zone, as rendered it uninha∣bitable, and their persisting in this error long after they began to have some commercial intercourse with several parts of India lying within the tropics, must appear so singular and absurd, that it may not be unacceptable to some of my readers to produce evidence of their holding this opinion, and to account for the apparent in∣consistence of their theory with their experience. Cicero, who had bestowed attention upon every part of philosophy known to the ancients, seems to have believed that the torrid zone was un∣inhabitable, and, of consequence, that there could be no inter∣course between the northern and southern temperate zones. He introduces Africanus thus addressing the younger Scipio: "You see this earth encompassed, and as it were, bound in by certain zones, of which, two, at the greatest distance from each other, and sustaining the opposite poles of heaven, are frozen with per∣petual cold; the middle one, and the largest, of all, is burnt with the heat of the sun; two are habitable, the people in the southern one are antipodes to us, with whom we have no con∣nection." <HI>Somnium Scipionis,</HI> c. 6. Geminus, a Greek philo∣sopher, contemporary with Cicero, delivers the same doctrine, not in a popular work, but in his <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, a treatise purely scientific. "When we speak," says he, "of the southern
<PB N="456" REF="034476_0453_0FFDD8A80AABA4C8"/>
temperate zone, and its inhabitants, and concerning those who are called antipodes, it must be always understood, that we have no certain knowledge or information concerning the southern tem∣perate zone, whether it be inhabited or not. But from the spherical figure of the earth, and the course which the sun holds between the tropics, we conclude that there is another zone, situ∣ated to the south, which enjoys the same degree of temperature with the northern one which we inhabit." Cap. xiii. p. 31. ap. Petavii Opus de Doctr. Temper. in quo Uranologium sive Syste∣mata var. Auctorum. Amst. 1705. vol. iii. The opinion of Pliny the naturalist, with respect to both these points, was the same: "There are five divisions of the earth, which are called zones. All that portion which lies near to the two opposite poles is oppressed with vehement cold, and eternal frost. There unblest with the aspect of milder stars, perpetual darkness reigns, or at the ut∣most a feeble light reflected from surrounding snows. The mid∣dle of the earth, in which is the orbit of the sun, is scorched and burnt up with flames and fiery vapour. Between these torrid and frozen districts lie two other portions of the earth, which are temperate; but, on account of the burning region interposed, there can be no communication between them. Thus Heaven has deprived us of three parts of the earth." Lib. ii. c. 68. Strabo delivers his opinion to the same effect, in terms no less explicit: "The portion of the earth which lies near the equator, in the torrid zone, is rendered uninhabitable by heat." Lib. ii. p. 154. To these I might add the authority of many other re∣spectable philosophers and historians of antiquity.</P>
<P>IN order to explain the sense in which this doctrine was gene∣rally received, we may observe, that Parmenides, as we are in∣formed by Strabo, was the first who divided the earth into five zones, and he extended the limits of the zone which he supposed to be uninhabitable on account of heat, beyond the tropics. Aris∣totle, as we learn likewise from Strabo, fixed the boundaries of the different zones in the same manner as they are defined by mo∣dern geographers. But the progress of discovery having gradu∣ally demonstrated that several regions of the earth which lay with∣in the tropics were not only habitable, but populous and fertile, this induced later geographers to circumscribe the limits of the torrid zone. It is not easy to ascertain with precision the boun∣daries which they allotted to it. From a passage in Strabo, who, as far as I know, is the only author of antiquity from whom we receive any hint concerning this subject, I should conjecture, that those who calculated according to the measurement of the earth by Eratosthenes, supposed the torrid zone to comprehend near sixteen degrees, about eight on each side of the equator; whereas such as followed the computation of Posidonius allotted about twenty-four degrees, or somewhat more than twelve degrees on
<PB N="457" REF="034476_0454_0FFDD8A99DE1B050"/>
each side of the equator to the torrid zone. Strabo, lib, ii. p. 151. According to the former opinion, about two-thirds of that por∣tion of the earth which lies between the tropics was considered as habitable; according to the latter, about one half of it. With this restriction, the doctrine of the ancients concerning the torrid zone appears less absurd; and we can conceive the reason of their asserting this zone to be uninhabitable, even after they had opened a communication with several places within the tropics. When men of science spoke of the torrid zone, they considered it as it was limited by the definition of geographers to sixteen, or at the utmost to twenty-four degrees; and as they knew almost nothing of the countries nearer to the equator, they might still suppose them to be uninhabitable. In loose and popu∣lar discourse, the name of the torrid zone continued to be given to all that portion of the earth which lies within the tropics. Cicero seems to have been unacquainted with those ideas of the later geographers, and adhering to the division of Parmenides, describes the torrid zone as the largest of the five. Some of the ancients rejected the notion concerning the intolerable heat of the torrid zone as a popular error. This, we are told by Plu∣tarch, was the sentiment of Pythagoras, and we learn from Strabo, that Eratosthenes and Polybius had adopted the same opinion, lib. ii. 154. Ptolemy seems to have paid no regard to the ancient doctrine and opinions concerning the torrid zone.</P>

<P>THE spherical figure of the earth was known to the ancient geographers. They invented the method, still in use, of computing the longitude and latitude of different places. Accor∣ding to their doctrine, the equator, or imaginary line which en∣compasses the earth, contained three hundred and sixty degrees; these they divided into twenty-four parts, or hours, each equal to fifteen degrees. The country of the <HI>Seres,</HI> or <HI>Sinae,</HI> being the farthest part of India known to the ancients, was supposed, by Marinus Tyrius, the most eminent of the ancient geographers before Ptolemy, to be fifteen hours, or two hundred and twenty-five degrees to the east of the first meridian, passing through the Fortunate Islands. Ptolemaei Geogr. lib. i. c. 11. If this sup∣position was well-founded, the country of the Seres, or China, was only nine hours, or one hundred and thirty-five degrees west from the Fortunate or Canary Islands; and the navigation, in that direction, was much shorter than by the course which the Portu∣guese were pursuing. Marco Polo, in his travels, had described countries, particularly the island of Cipango or Zipangri sup∣posed to be Japan, considerably to the east of any part of Asia known to the ancients. Marcus Paulus de Region. Oriental. lib. ii. c. 70. lib. iii. c. 2. Of course, this country, as it exten∣ded further to the east, was still nearer to the Canary Islands. The conclusions of Columbus, though drawn from inaccurate observa∣tions, were just. If the suppositions of Marinus had been well
<PB N="459" REF="034476_0456_0FFDD8CDF2040038"/>
founded, and if the countries, which Marco Polo visited, had been situated to the east of those whose longitude Marinus had ascertained, the proper and nearest course to the East Indies must have been to steer directly west. Herrera, dec. 1. lib. i. c. 2. A more extensive knowledge of the globe has now discovered the great error of Marinus, in supposing China to be fifteen hours, or two hundred and twenty-five degrees east from the Canary Islands, and that even Ptolemy was mistaken, when he reduced the longitude of China to twelve hours, or one hundred and eighty degrees. The longitude of the western frontier of that vast em∣pire is seven hours, or one hundred and fifteen degrees from the meridian of the Canary Islands. But Columbus followed the light which his age afforded, and relied upon the authority of writers, who were, at that time, regarded as the instructors and guides of mankind in the science of geography.</P>

<P>AS the Portuguese, in making their discoveries, did not de∣part far from the coast of Africa, they concluded that birds, whose flight they observed with great attention, did not venture to any considerable distance from land. In the infancy of navi∣gation, it was not known, that birds often stretched their flight to an immense distance from any shore. In sailing towards the West-Indian islands, birds are often seen at the distance of two hundred leagues from the nearest coast. Sloane's Nat. Hist. of Jamaica, vol. i. p. 30. Catesby saw an owl at sea, when the ship was six hundred leagues distance from land. Nat. Hist. of Carolina, pref. p. 7. Hist. Naturelle de M. Buffon, tom xvi. p. 32. From which it appears, that this indication of land, on which Columbus seems to have relied with some confidence, was ex∣tremely uncertain. This observation is confirmed by Captain Cook, the most extensive and experienced navigator of any age or nation. "No one yet knows (says he) to what distance any of the oceanic birds go to sea; for my own part, I do no believe that there is one in the whole tribe that can be relied on in pointing out the vicinity of land."

<P>THE account which Columbus gives of the humanity and order∣ly behaviour of the natives on this occasion is very striking. "The king (says he, in a letter to Ferdinand and Isabella) having been informed of our misfortune, expressed great grief for our loss, and immediately sent abroad all the people in the place in many large canoes; we soon unloaded the ship of every thing that was upon deck, as the king gave us great assistance: he himself, with his brothers and relations, took all possible care that every thing should be properly done▪ both aboard and on shore. And, from time to time, he sent some of his relations weeping, to beg of me not to be dejected, for he would give me all that he had. I can assure your highnesses, that so much care would not have been taken in securing our effects in any part of Spain, as all our pro∣perty was put together in one place near his palace, until the houses which he wanted to prepare for the custody of it, were emptied. He immediately placed a guard of armed men, who watched during the whole night, and those on shore lamented as if they had been much interested in our loss. The people are so affectionate, so tractable, and so peaceable, that I swear to your highnesses, that there is not a better race of men, nor a better country in the world. They love their neighbour as themselves; their conversation is the sweetest and mildest in the world, cheer∣ful, and always accompanied with a smile. And although it is true that they go naked, yet your highnesses may be assured that they have many very commendable customs; the king is served with great state, and his behaviour is so decent, that it is pleasant to see him, as it is likewise to observe the wonderful memory which these people have, and their desire of knowing every thing,

<P>EVERY monument or such a man as Columbus is valuable. A letter which he wrote to Ferdinand and Isabella, de∣scribing what passed on this occasion, exhibits a most striking pic∣ture of his intrepidity, his humanity, his prudence, his public spirit, and courtly address. "I would have been less concerned for this misfortune, had I alone been in danger, both because my life is a debt that I owe to the Supreme Creator, and because I have at other times been exposed to the most imminent hazard. But what gave me infinite grief and vexation was, that after it had pleased our Lord to give me faith to undertake this enter∣prise, in which I had now been so successful, that my opponents would have been convinced, and the glory of your highnesses, and the extent of your territory increased by me; it should please the Divine Majesty to stop all by my death. All this would have been more tolerable, had it not been attended with the loss of those men whom I had carried with me, upon promise of the greatest prosperity, who seeing themselves in such distress, cursed not only their coming along with me, but that fear and awe of me, which prevented them from returning as they often had re∣solved to have done. But besides all this, my sorrow was greatly increased, by recollecting that I had left my two sons at school at Cordova, destitute of friends, in a foreign country, when it could not in all probability be known that I had done such services as might induce your highnesses to remember them. And though I comforted myself with the faith that our Lord would not permit that, which tended so much to the glory of his church, and which I had brought about with so much trouble, to remain imperfect, yet I considered that on account of my sins, it was his will to deprive me of that glory, which I might have attained in this world. While in this confused state, I thought on the good for∣tune which accompanies your highnesses, and imagined, that al∣though I should perish, and the vessel be lost, it was possible that you might somehow come to the knowledge of my voyage, and the success with which it was attended. For that reason I wrote upon parchment with the brevity which the situation required, that I had disco∣vered the lands which I promised, in how many days I had done it, and what course I had followed. I mentioned the goodness of the country, the character of the inhabitants, and that your
<PB N="462" REF="034476_0459_0FFDD8D5D7FC2AD0"/>
highnesses subjects were left in possession of all that I had disco∣vered. Having sealed this writing, I addressed it to your high∣nesses, and promised a thousand ducats to any person who should deliver it sealed, so that if any foreigners found it, the promised reward might prevail on them not to give the information to ano∣ther. I then caused a great cask to be brought to me, and wrapping up the parchment in an oiled cloth, and afterwards in a cake of wax, I put it into the cask, and having stopped it well, I cast it, into the sea. All the men believed that it was some act of devo∣tion. Imagining that this might never chance to be taken up, as the ships approached nearer to Spain, I made another packet like the first, and placed it at the top of the poop, so that if the ship sunk, the cask remaining above water might be committed to the guidance of fortune."</P>

<P>SOME Spanish authors, with the meanness of national jealousy, have endeavoured to detract from the glory of Co∣lumbus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> insinuating that he was led to the discovery of the New World, not by his own inventive or enterprising genius, but by information which he had received. According to their account, a vessel having been driven from its course by easterly winds, was carried before them far to the west, and landed on the coast of an unknown country, from which it returned with difficulty; the pilot, and three sailors, being the only persons who survived the distresses which the crew suffered, from want of provisions, and fatigue in this long voyage. In a few days after their arrival, all the four died; but the pilot having been received into the house of Columbus, his intimate friend disclosed to him, before his death, the secret of the discovery which he had accidentally made, and left him his papers, containing a journal of the voyage, which served as a guide to Columbus in his undertaking. Gomara, as far as I know, is the first author who published this story, Hist. c. 13. Every circumstance is destitute of evidence to sup∣port it. Neither the name of the vessel nor its destination is known. Some pretend that it belonged to one of the sea-port towns in Andalusia, and was sailing either to the Canaries, or to Madeira; others, that it was a Biscayner in its way to England; others, a Portuguese ship trading on the coast of Guinea. The name of the pilot is alike unknown, as well as that of the port in which he landed on his return. According to some, it was in Portugal; according to others, in Madeira, or the Azores. The year in which this voyage was made is no less uncertain. Mon∣son's Nav. Tracts. Churchill, iii. 371. No mention is made of

this pilot or his discoveries, by And▪ Bernaldes▪ or Pet. Martyr, the contemporaries of Columbus. Herrera, with his usual judg∣ment, passes over it in silence. Oviedo takes notice of this re∣port, but considers it as a tale fit only to amuse the vulgar. Hist. lib. ii. c. 2. As Columbus held his course directly west from the Canaries, and never varied it, some later authors have supposed, that this uniformity is a proof of his being guided by some previous information. But they do not recollect the principles on which he founded all his hopes of success, that by holding a westerly course, he must certainly arrive at those regions of the east de∣scribed by the ancients. His firm belief of his own system led him to take that course, and to pursue it without deviation.</P>
<P>THE Spaniards are not the only people who have called in ques∣tion Columbus's claim to the honour of having discovered Ame∣rica. Some German authors ascribe this honour to Martin Be∣haim, their countryman. He was of the noble family of the Behaims of Schwartzbach, citizens of the first rank in the Im∣perial town of Nuremberg. Having studied under the celebrated John Muller, better known by the name of Regiomontanus, he acquired such knowledge of cosmography, as excited a desire of exploring those regions, the situation and qualities of which he had been accustomed, under that able master, to investigate and describe. Under the patronage of the duchess of Burgundy he repaired to Lisbon, whither the fame of the Portuguese discoveries invited all the adventurous spirits of the age. There, as we learn from Herman Schedel, of whose <HI>Chronicon Mundi</HI> a German translation was printed at Nuremberg, A. D. 1493, his merit as a cosmographer raised him, in conjunction with Diego Cano, to the command of a squadron fitted out for discovery in the year 1483. In that voyage, he is said to have discovered the kingdom of Congo. He settled in the island of Fayal, one of the Azores, and was a particular friend of Columbus. Herrera, dec. 1. lib. i. c. 2. Magellan had a terrestrial globe made by Behaim, on which he demonstrated the course that he purposed to hold in search of the communication with the South Sea, which he af∣terwards discovered. Gomara, Hist. c. 19. Herrera, dec. 11. lib. ii. c. 19. In the year 1492, Behaim visited his relations in Nuremberg, and left with them a map drawn with his own hand, and which is still preserved among the archieves of the family. Thus far the story of Martin Behaim seems to be well authenti∣cated; but the account of his having discovered any part of the New Wo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to be merely conjectural.</P>

D. 1714, by Jo. Frid. Stuvenius▪ I was induced, by the authority of Herrera, to suppose that Behaim was not a native of Germany;
<PB N="464" REF="034476_0461_0FFDD8DC670C0090"/>
but from more full and accurate information, communicated to me by the learned Dr. John Reinold Forster, I am now satisfied that I was mistaken. Dr. Forster has been likewise so good as to favour me with a copy of Behaim's map, as published by Dop∣pelmayer in his account of the Mathematicians and Artists of Nuremberg. From this map, the imperfection of cosmographi∣cal knowledge at that period is manifest. Hardly one place is laid down in its true situation. Nor can I discover from it any reason to suppose that Behaim had the least knowledge of any re∣gion in America. He delineates, indeed, an island to which he gives the name of St. Brandon. This, it is imagined, may be some part of Guiana, supposed at first to be an island. He places it in the same latitude with the Cape Verd isles, and I suspect it to be an imaginary island which has been admitted into some an∣cient maps on no better authority than the legend of the Irish St. Brandon or Brendan, whose story is so childishly fabulous, as to be unworthy of any notice. Girald. Cambriensis ap. Missingham Florilegium Sanctorum, p. 427.</P>
<P>THE pretensions of the Welsh to the discovery of America seem not to rest on a foundation much more solid. In the twelfth century, according to Powell, a dispute having arisen among the sons of Owen Guyneth, king of North-Wales, concerning the succession of his crown, Madoc, one of their number, weary of this contention, betook himself to sea in quest of a more quiet settlement. He steered due west, leaving Ireland to the north, and arrived in an unknown country, which appeared to him so de∣sirable, that he returned to Wales, and carried thither seve∣ral of his adherents and companions. This is said to have happened about the year 1170, and after that, he and his co∣lony were heard of no more. But it is to be observed, that Powell, on whose testimony the authenticity of this story rests, published his history above four centuries from the date of the event which he relates. Among a people as rude and illiterate as the Welsh at that period, the memory of a transaction so remote must have been very imperfectly preserved, and would require to be confirmed by some author of greater credit, and nearer to the aera of Madoc's voyage than Powell. Later antiquaries have indeed appealed to the testimony of Meredith ap Rhees, a Welsh bard, who died A. D. 1477. But he too lived at such a dis∣tance of time from the event, that he cannot be considered as a witness of much more credit than Powell. Besides, his verses, published by Hakluyt, vol. iii. p. 1. convey no information, but that Madoc, dissatisfied with his domestic situation, employed himself in searching the ocean for new possessions. But even if we admit the authenticity of Powell's story, it does not follow that the unknown country which Madoc discovered by steering west, in such a course as to leave Ireland to the north, was any
<PB N="465" REF="034476_0462_0FFDD8DF0861DFC0"/>
part of America. The naval skill of the Welsh in the twelfth century was hardly equal to such a voyage. If he made any dis∣covery at all, it is more probable that it was Madeira, or some other of the western isles. The affinity of the Welsh language with some dialects spoken in America, has been mentioned as a circumstance which confirms the truth of Madoc's voyage. But that affinity has been observed in so few instances, and in some of these is so obscure, or so fanciful, that no conclusion can be drawn from the casual resemblance of a small number of words. There is a bird, which, as far as is yet known, is found only on the coasts of South America, from Port Desire to the Straits of Magellan. It is distinguished by the name of <HI>Penguin.</HI> This word in the Welsh language signifies <HI>White-head.</HI> Almost all the authors who favour the pretensions of the Welsh to the discovery of America, mention this as an irrefragable proof of the affinity of the Welsh language with that spoken in this region of Ame∣rica. But Mr. Pennant, who has given a scientific description of the Penguin, observes, that all the birds of this genus have black heads, "so that we must resign every hope (adds he) founded on this hypothesis of retrieving the Cambrian race in the New World." Philos. Transact. vol. lviii. p. 91, &amp;c. Beside this, if the Welsh, towards the close of the twelfth century, had settled in any part of America, some remains of the Christian doc∣trine and rites must have been found among their descendants, when they were discovered about three hundred years posterior to their migration; a period so short, that, in the course of it, we cannot well suppose that all European ideas and arts would be totally forgotten. Lord Lyttleton, in his notes to the fifth book of his History of Henry II. p. 371, has examined what Powell relates concerning the discoveries made by Madoc, and invalidates the truth of his story by other arguments of great weight.</P>
<P>THE pretensions of the Norwegians to the discovery of Ame∣rica, seem to be better founded than those of the Germans or Welsh. The inhabitants of Scandinavia were remarkable in the middle ages for the boldness and extent of their maritime excur∣sions. In 874, the Norwegians discovered, and planted a co∣lony in Iceland. In 982, they discovered Greenland, and established settlements there. From that, some of their naviga∣tors proceeded towards the west, and discovered a country more in∣viting than those horrid regions with which they were acquainted. According to their representations, this country was sandy on the coasts, but in the interior parts level and covered with wood, on which account they gave it the name of <HI>Helle-land,</HI> and <HI>Mark-land,</HI> and having afterwards found some plants of the vine which bore grapes, they called it <HI>Win-land.</HI> The credit of this story rests, as far as I know, on the authority of the <HI>saga,</HI> or chroni∣cle of king Olaus, composed by Snorro Sturlonides, or <HI>Sturlusons,</HI>
<PB N="466" REF="034476_0463_0FFDD8E10B8EEC60"/>
published by Perinskiold at Stockholm, A. D. 1697. As Snorro was born in the year 1179, his chronicle might be compiled about two centuries after the event which he relates. His ac∣count of the navigation and discoveries of <HI>Biorn,</HI> and his com∣panion <HI>Lief,</HI> is a very rude confused tale, p. 104. 110. 326. It is impossible to discover from him, what part of America it was in which the Norwegians landed. According to his ac∣count of the length of the days and nights, it must have been as far north as the fifty-eighth degree of latitude, on some part of the coast of Labradore, approaching near to the entry of Hud∣son's Straits. Grapes, certainly, are not the production of that country. Torfeus supposes that there is an error in the text, by rectifying of which, the place where the Norwegians landed may be supposed to be situated in latitude 49°. But neither is that the region of the vine in America. From perusing Snorro's tale, I should think the situation of Newfoundland corresponds best with that of the country discovered by the Norwegians. Grapes, however, are not the production of that barren island. Other conjectures are mentioned by M. Mallet, Introd. a l'Hist. de Dennem. 175, &amp;c. I am not sufficiently acquainted with the literature of the north, to examine them. It seems manifest, that if the Norwegians did discover any part of America at that period, their attempts to plant colonies proved unsuccessful, and all knowledge of it was soon lost.</P>

From this he concluded, that if some unknown continent did not obstruct the navigation, there must be a short and easy access, by holding a westerly course, to this ex∣treme region of the East.

<P>COLUMBUS seems to have formed some very singular opini∣ons concerning the countries which he had now discovered. The violent swell and agitation of the waters on the coast of Trinidad led him to conclude this to be the highest part of the

Nor ought we to think it strange that a person of so much sagacity should be influenced by the opinion or reports of such a fabulous author as Mandeville. Columbus and the other discoverers were obliged to follow such guides as they could find; and it appears from several passages in the manuscript of Andr.

<P>IT is remarkable, that neither Gomara nor Oviedo, the most ancient Spanish historians of America, nor Herrera, con∣sider Ojeda, or his companion Vespucci, as the first discoverers of the continent of America. They uniformly ascribe this ho∣nour to Columbus. Some have supposed that national resent∣ment against Vespucci, for deserting the service of Spain, and entering into that of Portugal, may have prompted these writers to conceal the actions which he performed. But Martyr and Benzoni, both Italians, could not be warped by the same preju∣dice. Martyr was a contemporary author; he resided in the court of Spain, and had the best opportunity to be exactly inform∣ed with respect to all public transactions; and yet, neither in his Decads, the first general history published of the New World, nor in his Epistles, which contain an account of all the remark∣able events of his time, does he ascribe to Vespucci the honour of having first discovered the continent. Benzoni went as an adventurer to America in the year 1541, and resided there a con∣siderable time. He appears to have been animated with a warm zeal for the honour of Italy, his native country, and yet does not mention the exploits and discoveries of Vespucci-Herrera, who compiled his general history of America from the most authen∣tic records, not only follows those early writers, but accuses Vespucci of falsifying the dates of both the voyages which he made to the New World, and of confounding the one with the other, in order that he might arrogate to himself the glory of having discovered the continent. Her. dec. lib. iv. c. 2. He asserts, that in a judicial inquiry into this matter by the royal
<PB N="469" REF="034476_0466_0FFDD8EA4B872FE8"/>
fiscal, it was proved by the testimony of Ojeda himself, that he touched at Hispaniola when returning to Spain from his first voyage; whereas Vespucci gave out that they returned directly to Cadiz from the coast of Paria, and touched at Hispaniola only in their second voyage; and that he had finished the voyage in five months; whereas, according to Vespucci's account, he had employed seventeen months in performing it. Viaggio primo de Am. Vespucci, p. 36. Viag secundo, p. 45. Herrera gives a more full account of this inquest in another part of his decads, and to the same effect. Her dec. 1. lib. vii. c. 5. Columbus was in Hispaniola when Ojeda arrived there, and had by that time come to an agreement with Roldan, who opposed Ojeda's at∣tempt to excite a new in surrection, and, of consequence, his voyage must have been posterior to that of the admiral. Life of Columbus, c. 28. According to Vespucci's account, he set out on his first voyage May 10th, 1497. Viag. primo, p. 6. At that time Columbus was in the court of Spain preparing for his voyage, and seems to have enjoyed a considerable degree of fa∣vour. The affairs of the New World were at this juncture under the direction of Antonio Torres, a friend of Columbus. It is not probable, that at that period a commission would be granted to another person, to anticipate the admiral, by undertaking a voyage which he himself intended to perform. Fonseca, who patronized Ojeda, and granted the licence for his voyage, was not recalled to court, and reinstated in the direction of Indian affairs, until the death of prince John, which happened Septem∣ber 1497, P. Martyr, Ep. 182. several months posterior to the time at which Vespucci pretends to have set out upon his voyage. A life of Vespucci was published at Florence by the Abate Ban∣dini, A. D. 1745, 4to. It is a work of no merit, written with little judgment, and less candour. He contends for his country∣man's title to the discovery of the continent with all the blind zeal of national partiality, but produces no new evidence to support it. We learn from him that Vespucci's account of his voyage was published as early as the year 1510, and probably sooner. Vita di Am. Vesp. p. 52.

<P>THE form employed on this occasion, served as a model to the Spaniards in all their subsequent conquests in America. It is so extraordinary in its nature, and gives us such an idea of the proceedings of the Spaniards, and the principles upon which they founded their right to the extensive dominions which they
<PB N="470" REF="034476_0467_0FFDD8EC064A69A0"/>
acquired in the New World, that it well merits the attention of the reader. "I Alonso de Ojeda, servant of the most high and powerful king of Castile and Leon, the conquerors of barbarous nations, their messenger and captain, notify to you and declare, in as ample form as I am capable, that God our Lord, who is one and eternal, created the heaven and the earth, and one man and one woman, of whom you and we, and all the men who have been or shall be in the world, are descended. But as it has come to pass, through the number of generations during more than five thousand years, that they have been dispersed into va∣rious kingdoms and provinces, because one country was not able to contain them, nor could they have found in one the means of subsistence and preservation; therefore God our Lord gave the charge of all those people to one man, named St. Peter, whom he constituted the lord and head of all the human race, that all men, in whatever place they are born, or in whatever faith or place they are educated, might yield obedience unto him. He hath subjected the whole world to his jurisdiction, and command∣ed him to establish his residence in Rome, as the most proper place for the government of the world. He likewise promised and gave him power to establish his authority in every other part of the world, and to judge and govern all Christians, Moors, Jews, Gentiles, and all other people, of whatever sect or faith they may be. To him is given the name of <HI>Pope,</HI> which signi∣fies admirable, great father and guardian, because he is the father and governor of all men. Those who lived in the time of this holy father obeyed and acknowledged him as their lord and king, and the superior of the universe. The same has been observed with respect to them who, since his time, have been chosen to the pontificate. Thus it now continues, and will continue to the end of the world.</P>
<P>"ONE of these pontiffs, as lord of the world, hath made a grant of these islands, and of the Tierra Firme of the ocean sea, to the Catholic kings of Castile, Don Ferdinand and Donna Isabella, of glorious memory, and their successors, our sove∣reigns, with all they contain, as is more fully expressed in certain deeds passed upon that occasion, which you may see, if you de∣sire it. Thus his majesty is king and lord of these islands, and of the continent, in virtue of this donation; and, as king and lord aforesaid, most of the islands to which his title hath been notified, have recognised his majesty, and now yield obedience and subjection to him as their lord, voluntarily and without resist∣ance; and instantly as soon as they received information, they obeyed the religious men sent by the king to preach to them, and to instruct them in our holy faith; and all these, of their own free will, without any recompence or gratuity, became Christians, and continue to be so; and his majesty having received them gra∣ciously
<PB N="471" REF="034476_0468_0FFDD8F0AF321B88"/>
under his protection, has commanded that they should be treated in the same manner as his other subjects and vassals. You are bound and obliged to act in the same manner. Therefore I now entreat and require you to consider attentively what I have declared to you; and that you may more perfectly comprehend it, that you take such times as is reasonable, in order that you may acknowledge the Church <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the superior and guide of the uni∣verse, and likewise the holy father called the Pope, in his own right, and his majesty by his appointment, as king and so∣vereign lord of these islands, and of the Tierra Firme; and that you consent that the aforesaid holy fathers shall declare and preach to you the doctrine above mentioned. If you do this, you act well, and perform that to which you are bound and obliged; and his majesty, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I in his name, will receive you with love and kindness, and will leave you, your wives and children, free and exempt from servitude, and in the enjoyment of all you possess, in the same manner as the inhabitants of the islands. Besides this, his majesty will bestow upon you many privileges, exemptions, and rewards. But if you will not com∣ply, or maliciously delay to obey my injunction, then, with the help of God, I will enter your country by force, I will carry on war against you with the utmost violence, I will subject you to the yoke of obedience to the church and the king, I will take your wives and children, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ike them slaves, and sell or dis∣pose of them according to his majesty's pleasure; I will seize your goods, and do you all the mischief in my power, as rebellious sub∣jects, who will not acknowledge or submit to their lawful sove∣reign.

<P>AS a particular description makes a stronger impression than general assertions, I shall give one of Rio de la Plata by an eye-witness, P. Cattaneo, a Modenese Jesuit, who landed at Buenos Ayres in 1749, and thus represents what he felt when such new objects were first presented to his view. "While I re∣sided in Europe, and read in books of history or geography that the mouth of the river De la Plata was an hundred and fifty miles in breadth, I considered it as an e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ggeration, because in this hemisphere we have no example of such vast rivers. When I approached its mouth, I had the most vehement desire to ascertain the truth with my own eyes; and I have found the matter to be exactly as it was represented. This I deduce particularly from one circumstance: When we took our departure from Monte-Viedo, a fort situated more than a hundred miles from the mouth of the river, and where its breadth is considerably diminished, we sailed a complete day before we discovered the land on the opposite bank of the river; and when we were in the middle of the channel, we could not discern land on either side, and saw nothing but the sky and water, as if we had been in some great ocean. Indeed, we should have taken it to be sea, if the fresh water of the river, which was turbid like the Po, had not satis∣fied us that it was a river. Moreover, at Buenos Ayres, another hundred miles up the river, and where it is still much narrower,
<PB N="474" REF="034476_0471_0FFDD8F6AD6FDDD0"/>
it is not only impossible to discern the opposite coast, which is in∣deed very low and flat; but one cannot perceive the houses or the tops of the steeples in the Portuguese settlement at Colonia on the other side of the river."

M. de Buffon adopts this theory, and has not only improved it by new observa∣tions, but has employed his amazing powers of descriptive elo∣quence in embellishing and placing it in the most striking light. Some remarks may be added, which tend to illustrate more fully a doctrine of much importance in every inquiry concerning the temperature of various climates.</P>
<P>WHEN a cold wind blows over land, it must in its passage rob the surface of some of its heat. By means of this, the coldness of the wind is abated. But if it continue to blow in the same direction, it will come, by degrees, to pass over a surface already cooled, and will suffer no longer any abatement of its own keen∣ness. Thus as it advances over a large tract of land, it brings on all the severity of intense frost.</P>
<P>LET the same wind blow over an extensive and deep sea; the superficial water must be immediately cooled to a certain degree, and the wind proportionally warmed. But the superficial and colder water becoming specifically heavier than the warmer water below it, descends; what is warmer supplies its place, which, as
<PB N="475" REF="034476_0472_0FFDD8FA5D02BE18"/>
it comes to be cooled in its turn, continues to warm the air which passes over it, or to diminish its cold. This change of the super∣ficial water, and successive ascent of that which is warmer, and the consequent successive abatement of coldness in the air, is aided by the agitation caused in the sea by the mechanical action of the wind, and also by the motion of the tides. This will go on, and the rigour of the wind will continue to diminish until the whole water is so far cooled, that the water on the surface is no longer removed from the action of the wind, fast enough to hinder it from being arrested by frost. Whenever the surface freezes, the wind is no longer warmed from the water below, and it goes on with undiminished cold.</P>
<P>FROM those principles, may be explained the severity of winter frosts in extensive continents; their mildness in small islands, and the superior rigour of winter in those parts of North America with which we are best acquainted. In the north-west parts of Europe, the severity of winter is mitigated by the west winds, which usually blow in the months of November, December, and part of January.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, when a warm wind blows over land, it heats the surface, which must therefore cease to abate the fervour of the wind. But the same wind blowing over water, agitates it, brings up the colder water from below, and thus is continually losing somewhat of its own heat.</P>
<P>BUT the great power of the sea to mitigate the heat of the wind or air passing over it, proceeds from the following circumstance: that on account of the transparency of the sea, its surface cannot be heated to a great degree by the sun's rays; whereas the ground, subjected to their influence, very soon acquires great heat. When, therefore, the wind blows over a torrid continent, it is soon raised to a heat almost intolerable; but during its passage over an exten∣sive ocean, it is gradually cooled; so that on its arrival at the far∣thest shore, it is again fit for respiration.</P>
<P>THOSE principles will account for the sultry heats of large continents in the torrid zone; for the mild climate of islands in the same latitude; and for the superior warmth in summer, which large continents, situated in the temperate or colder zones of the earth, enjoy, when compared with that of islands. The heat of a climate depends not only upon the immediate effect of the sun's rays, but on their continued operation, on the effect which they have formerly produced, and which remains for some time in the ground. This is the reason why the day is warmest about two in ths afternoon, the summer warmest about the middle of July, and the winter coldest about the middle of January.</P>
<P>THE forests which cover America, and hinder the sun-beams from heating the ground, are a great cause of the temperate cli∣mate in the equatorial parts. The ground, not being heated,
<PB N="476" REF="034476_0473_0FFDD8FD1D163A60"/>
cannot heat the air; and the leaves, which receive the rays inter∣cepted from the ground, have not a mass of matter sufficient to ab∣sorb heat enough for this purpose. Besides, it is a known fact, that the vegetative power of a plant occasions a perspiration from the leaves in proportion to the heat to which they are exposed; and, from the nature of evaporation, this perspiration produces a cold in the leaf proportional to the perspiration. Thus the effect of the leaf in heating the air in contact with it, is prodigiously diminished. For those observations, which throw much additional light on this curious subject, I am indebted to my ingenious friend, Mr. Robison, professor of natural philosophy in the university of Edinburgh.</P>

<P>THE climate of the Brasil has been described by two eminent naturalists, Piso and Margrave, who observed it with a philosophical accuracy, for which we search in vain in the accounts of many other provinces in America. Both represent it as tem∣perate and mild, when compared with the climate of Africa. They ascribe this chiefly to the refreshing wind which blows con∣tinually from the sea.

with islands of floating ice. Histoire des Navigations aux Terres Australes, tom. ii. 256, &amp;c. Dr. Halley fell in with ice in latitude 59°. Id. tom. i. p. 47. Commodore Byron, when on the coast of Patagonia, latitude 50° 33′ south, on the fifteenth of December, which is midsummer in that part of the globe, the twenty-first of December being the longest day there, compares the climate to that of England in the middle of winter. Voyages by Hawkesworth, i. 25. Mr. Banks having landed on Terra del Fuego, in the Bay of Good Success, latitude 55°, on the sixteenth of January, which corresponds to the month of July in our hemisphere, two of his attendants died in one night of extreme cold, and all the party were in the most imminent danger of perishing. Id. ii. 51, 52. By the fourteenth of March, corresponding to September in our hemisphere, winter was set in with rigour, and the mountains were covered with snow. Ibid. 72. Captain Cook, in his voyage towards the South pole, furnishes new and striking instances of the extraor∣dinary predominance of cold in this region of the globe. "Who would have thought (says he) that an island, of no greater extent than seventy leagues in circuit, situated between the latitude of 54° and 55°, should in the very height of summer be, in a man∣ner, wholly covered, many fathoms deep, with frozen snow; but more especially the S. W. coast? The very summits of the lofty mountains were cased with snow and ice; but the quantity that lay in the valleys is incredible; and at the bottom of the bays, the coast was terminated by a wall of ice of considerable height." Vol. ii. p. 217.</P>
<P>IN some places of the ancient continent, an extraordinary de∣gree of cold prevails in very low latitudes. Mr. Bogle, in his embassy to the court of the Delai Lama, passed the winter of the year 1774 at Chamnenning, in latitude 31° 39′ N. He often found the thermometer in his room twenty-nine degrees un∣der the freezing point by Fahrenheit's scale; and in the middle of April the standing waters were all frozen, and heavy showers of snow frequently fell. The extraordinary elevation of the country seems to be the cause of this excessive cold. In travelling from Indostan to Thibet, the ascent to the summit of the Boutan Mountains is very great, but the descent on the other side is not in equal proportion. The kingdom of Thibet is an elevated re∣gion, extremely bare and desolate. Account of Thibet by Mr. Stewart, read in the Royal Society, p. 7. The extraordinary cold in low latitudes in America cannot be accounted for by the same cause. Those regions are not remarkable for elevation. Some of them are countries depressed and level.</P>
<P>THE most obvious and probable cause of the superior degree of cold, towards the southern extremity of America, seems to be the form of the continent there. Its breadth gradually decreases
<PB N="478" REF="034476_0475_0FFDD902821825E8"/>
as it stretches from St. Antonio southwards, and from the bay of St. Julian to the Straits of Magellan its dimensions are much contracted. On the cast and west sides, it is washed by the At∣lantic and Pacific Oceans. From its southern point it is probable that a great extent of sea, without any considerable tract of land, reaches to the Antarctic pole In whichever of these directions the wind blows, it is cooled before it approaches the Magellanic regions, by passing over a vast body of water, nor is the land there of such extent that it can recover any considerable degree of heat in its progress over it. These circumstances concur in rendering the temperature of the air in this district of America, more similar to that of an insular, than to that of a continental climate, and hinder it from acquiring the same degree of summer heat with places in Europe and Asia, in a corresponding northern latitude. The north wind is the only one that reaches this part of America, after blowing over a great continent. But from an attentive survey of its position, this will be found to have a ten∣dency, rather to diminish than augment the degree of heat. The southern extremity of America is properly the termination of the immense ridge of the Andes, which stretches nearly in a direct line from north to south, through the whole extent of the conti∣nent. The most sultry regions in South America, Guiana, Bra∣sil, Paraguay, and Tucaman, lie many degrees to the east of the Magellanic regions. The level country of Peru, which enjoys the tropical heats, is situated considerably to the west of them. The north wind then, though it blows over land, does not bring to the southern extremity of America, an increase of heat col∣lected in its passage over torrid regions; but before it arrives there, it must have swept along the summits of the Andes, and comes impregnated with the cold of that frozen region.</P>
<P>THOUGH it be now demonstrated that there is no southern continent in that region of the globe which it was supposed to occupy, it appears to be certain from Captain Cook's discoveries, that there is a large tract of land near the south pole, which is the source of most of the ice spread over the vast southern ocean. Vol. ii. p. 230, 239, &amp;c. Whether the influence of this remote frozen continent may reach the southern extremity of America, and affect its climate, is an inquiry not unworthy of attention.</P>

From antlers of the moose-deer which have been found in America, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> appears to have been an animal of great size. Near the banks of the Ohio, a considerable number of bones of an immense magni∣tude have been found.

This spot seems to be accurately laid down by Evans in his map. These bones must, have belonged to animals of enormous bulk; but naturalists being acquainted <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> living creature of such size, were at first inclined to think that they were mineral sub∣stances. Upon receiving a greater number of specimens, and after inspecting them more narrowly, they are now allowed to be the bones of an animal. As the elephant is the largest known quadruped, and the tusks which were found nearly resembled, both in form and quality, the tusks of an elephant, it was con∣cluded that the carcases deposited on the Ohio were of that spe∣cies. But Dr. Hunter, one of the persons of our age best qua∣lified to decide with respect to this point, having accurately exa∣mined several parcels of tusks, and grinders, and jawbones, sent from the Ohio to London, gives it as his opinion, that they did not belong to an elephant, but to some huge carnivorous animal of an unknown species.

<P>THIS degeneracy of the domestic European animals in Ame∣rica, may be imputed to some of these causes. In the Spa∣nish settlements, which are situated either within the torrid zone, or in countries bordering upon it, the increase of heat, and diversity of food, prevent sheep and horned cattle from attaining the same size as in Europe. They seldom become so fat, and their flesh is not so juicy, or of such delicate flavour. In North America, where the climate is more favourable, and simi∣lar to that of Europe, the quality of the grasses which spring up naturally in their pasture-grounds is not good. Mitchell, p. 15<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<P>WERE this the place for entering into a long and intricate geographical disquisition, many curious observations might arise from comparing the accounts of the two Russian voy∣ages, and the charts of their respective navigations. One remark is applicable to both. We cannot rely with absolute certainty on the position which they assign to several of the places which they visited. The weather was so extremely foggy, that they seldom saw the sun or stars, and the position of the islands and supposed continents was commonly determined by reckoning, not by obser∣vation.

Behring and Tschirikow proceeded much farther towards the east than Krenitzin. The land discovered by Behring, which he imagined to be the American continent, is in the 236th degree of longitude from the first meridian in the isle of Ferro, and in 58° 28′ of latitude. Tschirikow came upon the same coast in lon. 241°, lat. 56°. Muller, i. 248, 249. The former must have advanced 60 degrees from the port of Petropawlowski, from which he took his departure, and the latter 65 degrees. But from the chart of Krenitzin's voyage, it appears that he did not sail farther towards the east than the 208th de∣gree, and only 32 degrees from Petropawlowski. In 1741, Behring and Tschirikow, both in going and returning, held a course which was mostly to the south of that chain of islands, which they discovered; and observing the mountainous and rugged aspect of the head-lands which they descried towards the north, they supposed them to be promontories belonging to some part of the American continent, which, as they fancied, stretched as far South. as the latitude 56. In this manner they are laid down in the chart published by Muller, and likewise in a manuscript chart drawn by a mate of Behring's ship, communicated to me by Mr. Professor Robison. But in 1769, Krenitzin, after wintering in the island Alaxa, stood so far towards the north in his return, that his course lay through the middle of what Behring and Tschirikow had sup∣posed to be a continent, which he found to be an open sea, and that they had mistaken rocky isles for the head-lands of a continent. It is probable, that the countries discovered in 1741, towards the east, do not belong to the American continent, but are only a con∣tinuation of the chain of islands. The number of volcanos in this region of the globe is remarkable. There are several in Kamchatka, and not one of the islands, great or small, as far as the Russian navigation extends, is without them. Many are ac∣tually burning, and the mountains in all bear parts of having been once in a state of eruption. Were I disposed to admit such con∣jectures as have found place in other enquiries concerning the peopling of America, I might suppose that this part of the earth, having manifestly suffered violent convulsions from earthquakes and volcanos, an isthmus, which may have formerly united Asia to America, has been broken, and formed into a cluster of islands by the shock.</P>
<P>IT is singular, that at the very time the Russian navigators were attempting to make discoveries in the north-west of America, the Spaniards were prosecuting the same design from another quarter. In 1769, two small vessels sailed from Loretto in California to ex∣plore the coasts of the country to the north of that peninsula. They advanced no farther than the port of Monte-Rey in latitude 36. But, in several successive expeditions fitted out from the port of St. Blas in New Galicia, the Spaniards have advanced as

far as the latitude 58. <HI>Gazeta de Madrid,</HI> March 19, and May 14, 1776. But as the journals of those voyages have not yet been published, I cannot compare their progress with that of the Russians, or shew how near the navigators of the two nations have approached to each other.

<P>OUR knowledge of the vicinity of the two continents of Asia and America, which was very imperfect when I published the history of America in the year 1777, is now complete. Mr. Cox's Account of the Russian discoveries between Asia and Ame∣rica, printed in the year 1780, contains many curious and impor∣tant facts with respect to the various attempts of the Russians to open a communication with the New World. The History of the great Voyage of Discovery, begun by Captain Cook in 1776, and completed by Captains Clerk and Gore, published in the year 1780, communicates all the information that the curiosity of man∣kind could desire with regard to this subject.</P>
<P>AT my request, my friend Mr. Playfair, Professor of Mathe∣maticks in the University of Edinburgh, has compared the narra∣tive and charts of those illustrious navigators, with the more im∣perfect relations and maps of the Russians. The result of this comparison I communicate in his own words, and with much greater confidence in his scientific accuracy, that I could have ventured to place in any observations which I myself might have made upon the subject.</P>
<P>"THE discoveries of Captain Cook in his last voyage, have confirmed the conclusions which Dr. Robertson had drawn, and have connected together the facts from which they were deduced. They have now rendered it certain that Behring and Tschirikow touched on the coast of America in 1741. The former discovered land in lat. 58° 28′, and about 236° east from Ferro. He has given such a description of the Bay in which he anchored, and the high mountain to the westward of it, which he calls St. Elias, that though the account of his voyage is much abridged in the English translation, Captain Cook recog∣nized the place as he sailed along the Western coast of America, in the year 1778. The isle of St. Hermogenes, near the mouth of Cook's river, Schumagins Isles on the coast of Alashka, and Foggy isle, retain in Captain Cook's chart the names which they had received from the Russian navigator. Cook's Voy. vol. ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>17.</P>
<P><PB N="485" REF="034476_0482_0FFDD915030FEF80"/>"TSCHIRIKOW came upon the same coast about 2° 30′ far∣ther south than Behring, near the Mount Edgecumbe of Captain Cook.</P>
<P>"WITH regard to Krenitzin, we learn from Coxe's Account of the Russian Discoveries, that he sailed from the mouth of the Kamtchatka river with two ships in the year 1768. With his own ship he reached the island Oonolashka, in which there had been a Russian settlement since the year 1762, where he wintered probably in the same harbour or bay where Captain Cook afterwards anchored. The other ship wintered at Alashka, which was sup∣posed to be an island, though it be in fact a part of the American continent. Krenitzin, accordingly, returned without knowing that either of his ships had been on the coast of America; and this is the more surprising, because Captain Cook has informed <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that Alashka is understood to be a great continent both by the Russians and the natives at Oonolashka.</P>
<P>"ACCORDING to Krenitzin, the ship which had wintered at Alashka had hardly sailed 32° to the eastward of the harbour of St. Peter and St. Paul in Kamtchatka; but, according to the more accurate charts of Captain Cook, it had sailed no less than 37° 17′ to the eastward of that harbour. There is nearly the same mistake of 5° in the longitude which Krenitzin assigns to Oonolashka. It is remarkable enough, that in the chart of those seas, put into the hands of Captain Cook by the Russians on that island, there was an error of the same kind, and very nearly of the same extent.</P>
<P>"BUT what is of most consequence to be remarked on this subject is, that the discoveries of Captain Cook have fully veri∣fied Dr. Robertson's conjecture, "that it is probable that future navigators in those seas, by steering farther to the north than Beh∣ring and Tschirikow or Krenitzin had done, may find that the continent of America approaches still nearer to that of Asia." Vol. ii. p. 44. It has accordingly been found that these two con∣tinents, which in the parallel of 55°, or that of the southern ex∣tremity of Alashka, are about four hundred leagues asunder, ap∣proach continually to one another as they stretch together toward the north, until, within less than a degree from the polar circle, they are terminated by two capes, only thirteen leagues distant. The east cape of Asia is in latitude 66° 6′, and in longitude 190° 22′ east from Greenwich, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he western extremity of America, or Prince of Wales Cape, is in latitude 65° 46′, and in longitude 191° 45′. Nearly in the middle of the narrow strait (Behring's Strait) which separates these capes, are the two islands of St. Diomede, from which both continents may be seen. Captain King informs us; that as he was sailing through this strait July 5, 1779, the fog having cleared away, he enjoyed the pleasure of seeing from the ship the continents of Asia and America at the same mo∣ment,
<PB N="486" REF="034476_0483_0FFDD916CE3C5D08"/>
together with the islands of St. Diomede lying between them. Cook's Voy. vol. iii. p. 244.</P>
<P>"BEYOND this point the strait opens towards the Arctic Sea, and the coasts of Asia and America diverge so fast from one ano∣ther, that in the parallel of 69° they are more than one hundred leagues asunder. Ib. p. 277. To the south of the strait there are a number of islands, Clerke's Kings, Anderson's, &amp;c. which, as well as those of St. Diomede, may have facilitated the migra∣tions of the natives from the one continent to the other. Captain Cook, however, on the authority of the Russians at Oonolashka, and for other good reasons, has diminished the number of islands which had been inserted in former charts of the northern Archi∣pelago. He has also placed Alashka, or the promontory which stretches from the continent of America S. W. towards Kamt∣chatka, at the distance of five degrees of longitude farther from the coast of Asia than it was reckoned by the Russian naviga∣tors.</P>
<P>"THE geography of the Old and the New World is therefore equally indebted to the discoveries made in this memorable voyage; and as many errors have been corrected, and many deficiencies supplied by means of these discoveries, so the accuracy of some former observations has been established. The basis of the map of the Russian Empire, as far as regarded Kamtchatka, and the country of the Tschutzki, was the position of four places, Yak∣utsh, Ochotz, Bolcheresk, and Petropawlowski, which had been determined by the astronomer Krassilnicow in the year 1744. Nov. Coment. Petrop. vol. iii. p. 465, &amp;c. But the accuracy of his observations was contested by M. Engel, and Mr. Robert de Vaugondy; Coxe Append. i. No. 2. p. 267, 272; and the former of these geographers ventured to take away no less than 28 degrees from the longitude, which, on the faith of Krassilnicow's observations, was assigned to the eastern boundary of the Russian empire. With how little reason this was done, will appear from considering that our British navigators, having determined the po∣sition of Petropawlowski by a great number of very accurate ob∣servations, found the longitude of that port 158° 43′ E. from Greenwich, and its latitude 53° 1′; agreeing, the first to less than seven minutes, and the second to less than half a minute, with the calculations of the Russian astronomer: a coincidence which, in the situation of so remote a place, does not leave an uncertainty of more than four English miles, and which, for the credit of science, deserves to be particularly remarked. The chief error in the Russian maps has been in not extending the boundaries of that empire sufficiently towards the east. For as there was nothing to connect the land of the Tschutzki and north east point of Asia with those places whereof the position had been carefully ascertained, except the imperfect accounts of Beh∣ring's
<PB N="487" REF="034476_0484_0FFDD91A6E870E78"/>
and Synd's voyages, considerable errors could not fail to be introduced, and that point was laid down as not more than 23° 2′ east of the meridian of Petropawlowski. Coxe App. i. No. 2. By the observations of Captain King, the difference of longitude between Petropawloski and the East Cape is 31° 9′; that is 8° 7′ greater than it was supposed to be by the Russian geographers." It appears from Cook's and King's Voy. iii. p. 272. that the con∣tinents of Asia and America are usually joined together by ice during winter. Mr. Samwell confirms this account of his supe∣rior officer. "At this place, viz. near the latitude of 66° N. the two coasts are only thirteen leagues asunder, and about mid∣way between them lie two islands, the distance from which to either shore is short of twenty miles. At this place▪ the natives of Asia could find no difficulty in passing over to the opposite coast. which is in sight of their own. That in a course of years such an event would happen, either through design or accident, cannot ad∣mit of a doubt. The canoes which we saw among the Tschutzski were capable of performing a much longer voyage; and, however rude they may have been at a distant period▪ we can scarcely suppose them unequal to a passage of six or seven leagues. People might have been carried over by accident on floating pieces of ice. They might have also travelled across on sledges or on foot; for we have reason to believe that the strait is entirely frozen over in the winter; so that during that season, the continents, with respect to the communication between them, may be considered as one land." Letter from Mr. Samwell, Scots Magazine for 1788, p. 604. It is probable that this interesting portion of geo∣graphical knowledge will, in the course of a few years, receive farther improvement. Soon after the publication of Capt. Cook's last voyage, the great and enlightened Sovereign of Russia, atten∣tive to every thing that may contribute to extend the bounds of science, or to render it more accurate, formed the plan of a new voyage of discovery, in order to explore those parts of the ocean lying between Asia and America, which Captain Cook did not visit, to examine more accurately the islands which stretch from one continent almost to the other, to survey the north-east coast of the Russian empire, from the mouth of the Kovyma, or Ko∣lyma, to the North Cape, and to settle, by astronomical observa∣tions, the position of each place worth notice. The conduct of this important enterprize is committed to Captain Billings, an English officer in the Russian service, of whose abilities for that station it will be deemed the best evidence, that he accompanied Captain Cook in his last voyage. To render the expedition more extensively useful, an eminent naturalist is appointed to attend Captain Billings. Six years will be requisite for accomplishing the purposes of the voyage.

<P>FEW travellers have had such opportunity of observing the na∣tives of America, in its various districts, as Don Antonio Ulloa. In a work lately published by him, he thus describes the characteristical features of the race:" a very small forehead, co∣vered with hair towards its extremities, as far as the middle of the eye-brows; little eyes, a thin nose, small and bending to∣wards the upper lip; the countenance broad; the ears large; the hair very black, lank, and coarse; the limbs well turned, the feet small, the body of just proportion; and altogether smooth and free from hair, until old age, when they acquire some beard, but never on the cheeks." Noticias Americanas, &amp;c. p. 307. M. le Chevalier de Pinto, who resided several years in a part of America which Ulloa never visited, gives a sketch of the general 2aspect of the Indians there. "They are all of copper colour, with some diversity of shade, not in proportion to their distance from the equator, but according to the degree of elevation of the territory which they inhabit. Those who live in a high country are fairer than those in the marshy low lands on the coast. Their face is round, farther removed, perhaps, than that of any people from an oval shape. Their forehead is small, the extremity of their ears far from the face, their lips thick, their nose flat, their eyes black, or of a chesnut colour. small. but capable of discern∣ing objects at a great distance. Their hair is always thick and sleek, and without any tendency to curl. They have no hair on any part of their body but the head. At the first aspect, a southern American appears to be mild and innocent, but on a more atten∣tive view, one discovers in his countenance something wild, dis∣trustful, and sullen.'

The Indians, in warm climates, such as those on the coasts of the South Sea, on the river of Amazons, and the river Orinoco, are not to be com∣pared for strength with those in cold countries; and yet, says he, boats daily set out from Para, a Portuguese settlement on the river of Amazons, to ascend that river against the rapidity of the stream, and with the same crew they proceed to San Pablo, which is eight hundred leagues distant. No crew of white people, or even of negroes, would be found equal to a task of such persevering fa∣tigue, as the Portuguese have experienced, and yet the Indians, being accustomed to this labour from their infancy, perform it.

Notic. Americanus, p. 308.

<P>THE testimonies of different travellers, concerning the Pata∣gonians, have been collected and stated with a considerable degree of accuracy by the author of Recherches Philosophiques, &amp;c. tom. i. 281, &amp;c. iii. 181, &amp;c. Since the publication of his work, several navigators have visited the Magellanic regions, and, like their predecessors, differ very widely in their accounts of its inhabitants. By Commodore Byron and his crew, who sailed through the Straits in 1764, the common size of the Patagonians was estimated to be eight feet, and many of them much taller. Phil. Transact. vol. lvii. p. 78. By Captains Wallis and Car∣teret, who actually measured them in 1766, they were found to be from six feet to six feet five and seven inches in height. Phil. Tras. vol. lx. p. 22. These, however, seem to have been the very people whose size had been rated so high in the year 1764; for several of them had beads and red baize of the same kind with what had been put aboard Captain Wallis's ship, and he naturally concluded that they had got these from Mr. Bryon. Hawkesw. i. In 1767 they were again measured by M. Bougainville, whose ac∣count differs little from that of Captain Wallis. Voy. 129. To these I shall add a testimony of great weight. In the year 1762, Don Bernardo Ibagnez de Echavrari accompanied the Marquis de Valdelirios to Buenos Ayres, and resided there several years. He is a very intelligent author, and his reputation for veracity unimpeached among his countrymen. In speaking of the country towards the southern extremity of America, "By what Indians,"

says he, "is it possessed? Not certainly by the fabulous Patago∣nians, who are supposed to occupy this district. I have from many eye-witnesses, who have lived among those Indians, and traded much with them, a true and accurate description of their persons. They are of the same stature with Spaniards. I never saw one who rose in height two <HI>varas</HI> and two or three inches," <HI>i. e.</HI> about 80 or 81.332 inches English, if Echavarri makes his com∣putation according to the <HI>vara</HI> of Madrid. This agrees nearly with the measurement of Captain Wallis. Reyno Jesuitico, 238. Mr. Falkner, who resided as a missionary forty years in the south∣ern parts of America, says, that "the Patagonians, or Puel∣ches, are a large-bodied people; but I never heard of that gigan∣tic race which others have mentioned, though I have seen persons of all the different tribes of southern Indians." Introd. p. 26. M. Dobrizhoffer, a Jesuit, who resided eighteen years in Paraguay, and who had seen great numbers of the various tribes which inha∣bit the countries situated upon the Straits of Magellan, confirms, in every point the testimony of his brother missionary Falkner. Do∣brizho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fer enters into a detail with respect to the opinions of several authors concerning the stature of the Patagonians. Having men∣tioned the reports of some early travellers with regard to the ex∣traordinary size of some bones found on that coast, which were supposed to be human; and having endeavoured to shew that these bones belonged to some large marine or land animal, he con∣cludes, "de hisce ossibus crede quicquid libuerit, dummodo, me suasore; Patagones, pro gigantibus desinas habere."

<P>ANTONIO SANCHEZ RIBEIRO, a learned and inge∣nious physician, published a dissertation in the year 1765, in which he endeavours to prove, that this disease was not intro∣duced from America, but took its rise in Europe, and was brought on by an epidemical and malignant disorder. Did I chuse to enter into a disquisition on this subject, which I should not have men∣tioned, if it had not been intimately connected with this part of my inquiries, it would not be difficult to point out some mistakes with respect to the facts upon which he founds, as well as some errors in the consequences which he draws from them. The rapid com∣munication of this disease from Spain over Europe, seems how∣ever to resemble the progress of an epidemic, rather than that of a disease trasmitted by infection. The first mention of it is in the year 1493, and before the year 1497 it had made its appearance in most countries of Europe, with such alarming symptoms as ren∣dered

<P>AS the view which I have given of rude nations is extremely different from that exhibited by very respectable authors, it may be proper to produce some of the many authorities on which I found my description. The manners of the savage tribes in America have never been viewed by persons more capable of ob∣serving them with discernment, than the philosophers employed by France and Spain, in the year 1735, to determine the figure of the earth. M. Bouguer, D. Antonio d'Ulloa, and D. Jorge Juan, resided long among the natives of the least civilized provin∣ces in Peru. M. de la Condamine had not only the same advan∣tages with them for observation, but, in his voyage down the Maragnon, he had an opportunity of inspecting the state of the various nations seated on its banks, in its vast course across the continent of South America. There is a wounderful resemblance in their representation of the character of the Americans. "They are all extremely indolent," says M. Bouguer, "they are stupid, they pass whole days sitting in the same place, without moving, or speaking a single word. It is not easy to describe the degree of their indifference for wealth, and all its advantages. One does not well know what motive to propose to them, when one would persuade them to perform any service. It is vain to offer them money; they answer, that they are not hungry." Voyage au Perou, p. 102. "If one considers them as men, the narrowness of their understanding seems to be incompatible with the excellence of the soul. Their imbecility is so visible, that one can hardly form an idea of them different from what one has of the brutes. Nothing disturbs the tranquillity of their souls equally
<PB N="493" REF="034476_0490_0FFDD92A326A99D8"/>
insensible to disasters and to prosperity. Though half-naked, they are as contented as a monarch in his most splendid array. Riches do not attract them in the smallest degree, and the autho∣rity or dignities to which they may aspire are so little the objects of their ambition, that an Indian will receive with the same in∣difference the office of a judge (Alcade) or that of a hangman, if deprived of the former and appointed to the latter. Nothing can move or change them. Interest has no power over them, and they often refuse to perform a small service, though certain of a great recompence. Fear makes no impression on them, and res∣pect as little. Their disposition is so singular that there is no me∣thod of influencing them, no means of rousing them from that in∣difference, which is proof against all the endeavours of the wisest persons; no expedient which can induce them to abandon that gross ignorance, or lay aside that careless negligence, which dis∣concert the prudence and disappoint the care of such as are atten∣tive to their welfare." Voyage d'Ulloa, tom. i. 335, 356. Of those singular qualities he produces many extraordinary instances, p 336—347. "Insensibility," says M. de la Condamine, "is the basis of the American character. I leave others to determine, whether this should be dignified with the name of apathy, or dis∣graced with that of stupidity. It arises, without doubt, from the small number of their ideas, which do not extend beyond their wants. Gluttons even to voracity, when they have wherewithal to satisfy their appetite. Temperatc, when necessity obliges them to such a degree, that they can endure want without seeming to desire any thing. Pusillanimous and cowardly to excess, unless when they are rendered desperate by drunkenness. Averse to labour, indifferent to motives of glory, honour or gratitude; occupied entirely by the object that is present, and always determi∣ned by it alone, without any solicitude about futurity; incapable of foresight or of reflection; abandoning themselves▪ when under no restraint, to a puerile joy, which they express by frisking about, and immoderate fits of laughter; without object or design, they pass their life without thinking, and grow old without advancing beyond childhood, of which they retain all the defects. If this description were applicable only to the Indians in some provinces of Peru, who are slaves in every respect but the name, one might believe, that this degree of degeneracy was occasioned by the ser∣vile dependence to which they are reduced; the example of the modern Greeks being proof how far servitude may degrade the human species. But the Indians in the missions of the Jesuits, and the savages who still enjoy unimpaired liberty, being as limited in their faculties, not to say as stupid as the other, one cannot ob∣serve▪ without humiliation, that man, when abandoned to simple nature, and deprived of the advantages resulting from education and society, differs but little from the brute creation."

de la Riv. de Amaz. 52, 53. M. de Chanvalon, an intelligent and philosophical observer, who visited Martinico in 1751, and resided there six years, gives the following description of the Ca∣raibs: "It is not the red colour of their complexion▪ it is not the singularity of their features, which constitute the chief difference between them and us. It is their excessive simplicity; it is the li∣mited degree of their faculties. Their reason is not more enlight∣ened or more provident than the instinct of brutes. The reason of the most gross peasants, that of the negroes brought up in the parts of Africa most remote from intercourse with Europeans, is such that we discover appearances of intelligence, which, though imperfect, is capable of increase. But of this the understanding of Caraibs seems to be hardly susceptible. If sound philosophy and religion did not afford us their light, if we were to decide ac∣cording to the first impression which the view of that people makes upon the mind, we should be disposed to believe that they do not belong to the same species with us. Their stupid eyes are the true mirrour of their souls; it appears to be without functions. Their indolence is extreme; they have never the least solicitude about the moment which is to succeed that which is present." Voyage a la Martinique, p. 44, 45, 51. M. de la Borde, Tertre, and Rochefort, confirm this description. "The characteristics of the Californians," says P. Venegas, "as well as of all other In∣dians; are stupidity and insensibility; want of knowledge and re∣flection; inconstancy, impetuosity, and blindness of appetite; an excessive sloth, and abhorrence of labour and fatigue; an excessive love of pleasure and amusement of every kind, however trifling or brutal; pusilanimity, and, in fine, a most wretched want of every thing which constitutes the real man, and renders him ra∣tional, inventive, tractable, and useful to himself and society. It is not easy for Europeans, who never were out of their own coun∣try, to conceive an adequate idea of those people; for, even in the least frequented corners of the globe, there is not a nation so stu∣pid, of such contracted ideas, and so weak both in body and mind, as the unhappy Californians. Their understanding comprehends little more than what they see; abstract ideas, and much less a chain of reasoning, being far beyond their power; so that they scarce ever improve their first ideas, and these are in general false, or at least inadequate. It is in vain to represent to them any future advantages which will result to them from doing or abstaining from this or that particular immediately present; the relation of means and ends being beyond the stretch of their faculties. Nor have they the least notion of pursuing such intentions as will procure themselves some future good, or guard them against future evils. Their will is proportional to their faculties, and all their passions move in a very narrow sphere. Ambition they have none, and are more desirous of being accounted strong than valiant. The
<PB N="495" REF="034476_0492_0FFDD92E67EB92F0"/>
objects of ambition with us honour, same, reputation, titles, posts, and distinctions of superiority, are unknown among them; so that this powerful spring of action, the cause of so much seeming good and real evil in the world, has no power here. This disposition of mind, as it gives them up to an amazing langour and lassitude, their lives fleeting away in a perpetual inactivity and detestation of la∣bour, so it likewise induces them to be attracted by the first object which their own fancy, or the persuasion of another, places before them; and at the same time renders them as prone to alter their resolutions with the same facility. They look with indifference upon any kindness done them; nor is even the bare remembrance of it to be expected from them. In a word, the unhappy mortals may be compared to children, in whom the developement of reason is not completed. They may indeed be called a nation who never arrive at manhood." Hist. of Califor.

<P>REMARKABLE instances occur of the calamities which rude nations suffer by famine. Alvar Nugnez Cabeca de Vaca, one of the most gallant and virtuous of the Spanish adven∣turers, resided almost nine years among the savages of Florida. They were unacquainted with every species of agriculture. Their
<PB N="497" REF="034476_0494_0FFDD934A425F3B8"/>
subsistence was poor and precarious. "They live chiefly (says he) upon roots of different plants, which they procure with great difficulty, wandering from place to place in search of them. Some∣times they kill game, sometimes they catch fish, but in such small quantities, that their hunger is so extreme as compels them to eat spiders, the eggs of ants, worms, lizards, serpents, a kind of unctuous earth, and I am persuaded, that if in this country there were any stones they would swallow these. They preserve the bones of fishes and serpents, which they grind into powder, and eat. The only season when they do not suffer much from famine, is when a certain fruit, which he calls <HI>Tunas,</HI> is ripe. This is the same with the <HI>Opuntia,</HI> or prickly pear, of a reddish and yellow colour, with a sweet insipid taste.

<P>NEW HOLLAND, a country which formerly was only known, has lately been visited by intelligent observers. It lies in a region of the globe where it must enjoy a very favourable climate, as it stretches from the 10th to the 38th degree of nor∣thern latitude. It is of great extent, and from its square form must be much more than equal to all Europe. The people who inhabit the various parts of it appear to be of one race. They are evidently ruder than most of the Americans, and have made still less progress in improvement and the arts of life. There is not the least appearance of cultivation in any part of this vast re∣gion. The inhabitants are extremely few so that the country appears almost desolate. Their tribes are still more inconsiderable than those of America. They depend for subsistence almost en∣tirely on fishing. They do not settle in one place but roam about in quest of food. Both sexes go stark-naked. Their habitations, utensils, &amp;c. are more simple and rude than those of the Ameri∣cans. Voyages, by Hawkesworth, iii. 622, &amp;c. This, perhaps, is the country where man has been discovered in the earliest stage of his progress, and it exhibits a miserable specimen of his condi∣tion and powers in that uncultivated state.

<P>I STRONGLY suspect that a community of goods, and an undivided store, are known only among the rudest tribes of hunters; and that as soon as any species of agriculture or regular industry is known, the idea of an exclusive right of property to the fruits of them is introduced. I am confirmed in this opinion by accounts which I have received concerning the state of proper∣ty among the Indians in very different regions of America. "The idea of the natives of Brasil concerning property is, that if any person cultivate a field, he alone ought to enjoy the produce of it, and no other has a title to pretend to it. If an individual or family go a-hunting or fishing, what is caught belongs to the individual or to the family▪ and they communicate no part of it to any but to their cazique, or to such of their kindred as happen to be indisposed. If any person in the village come to their hut, he may sit down freely, and eat without asking liberty. But this is the consequence of their general principle of hospita∣lity; for I never observed any partition of the increase of their fields, or the produce of the chace, which I could consider as the result of any idea concerning a community of goods.
<PB N="500" REF="034476_0497_0FFDD94EADAF2CD8"/>
On the contrary, they are so much attached to what they deem to be their property, that it would be extremely dangerous to encroach upon it. As far as I have seen, or can learn, there is not one tribe of Indians in South America, among whom that community of goods which has been so highly extolled is known. The circumstance in the go∣vernment of the Jesuits, most irksome to the Indians of Paraguay, was the community of goods which those fathers introduced. This was repugnant to the original ideas of the Indians. They were acquainted with the rights of private exclusive property, and they submitted with impatience to regulations which destroyed them." M. de Cheval. de Pinto, MS. <HI>penes me.</HI> "Actual possession (says a missionary who resided several years among the Indians of the Five Nations) gives a right to the soil, but whenever a pos∣sessor sees fit to quit it, another has as good right to take it as he who left it. This law, or custom, respects not only the particu∣lar spot on which he erects his house, but also his planting-ground. If a man has prepared a particular spot of ground, on which he designs in future to build or plant, no man has a right to incom∣mode him, much less to the fruit of his labours, until it appears that he voluntarily gives up his views. But I never heard of any formal conveyance from one Indian to another in their natural state. The limits of every canton is circumscribed; that is, they are allowed to hunt as far as such a river on this hand, and such a mountain on the other. This area is occupied and improved by individuals and their families. Individuals, not the community, have the use and profit of their own labours, or success in hunting."

It is true, that they acknowledge certain Caziques, who are heads of their families or villages, but their authority appears chiefly in war, and the ex∣peditions against their enemies.

<P>AS the ideas of the North Americans▪ with respect to the mode of carrying on war, are generally known; I have founded my observations chiefly upon the testimony of the authors who describe them. But the same maxims took place among other nations in the New World. A judicious missionary has given a view of the military operations of the people of Gran Chaco, in South America, perfectly similar to those of the Iroquois. "They are much addicted to war (says he) which they carry on frequent∣ly among themselves, but perpetually against the Spaniards. But they may rather be called thieves than soldiers, for they never make head against the Spaniards, unless when they can assault them by stealth, or have guarded against any mischance by spies, who may be called indefatigable; they will watch the settlements of the Spaniards for one, two, or three years. observing by night every thing that passes with the utmost solicitude, whether they may expect resistance or not, and until they are perfectly secure of the event, they will not venture upon an attack; so that when they give the assault, they are certain of success, and free from all danger. These spies▪ in order that they may not be observed, will creep on all-four like cats in the night; but if they are dis∣covered, make their escape with much dexterity. But although they never chuse to face the Spaniards, if they be surrounded in any place, whence they cannot escape, they will fight with despe∣rate valour, and sell their lives very dear."

They make use of a hollow reed, about nine feet long, and an inch thick, which is called a <HI>Sarbacane.</HI> In it they lodge a small arrow, with some unspun cotton wound about its great end; this confines the air, so that they can blow it with astonishing rapidity and a sure aim, to the distance of a above a hundred paces. These small arrows are always poisoned. Fermin Descr. de Surin. i. 55. Bancroft's Hist. of Guiana, p. 281, &amp;c. The Sarbacane is much used in some parts of the East Indies.</P>

<P>I MIGHT produce many instances of this, but shall satisfy myself with one, taken from the Eskimaux. "Their greatest ingenuity (says Mr. Ellis) is shewn in the structure of their bows, made commonly of three pieces of wood, each ma∣king part of the same arch, very nicely and exactly joined toge∣ther. They are commonly of fir or larch: and as this wants strength and elasticity, they supply both by bracing the back of the bow, with a kind of thread, or line made of the sinews of their deer, and the bow-string of the same materials. To make them
<PB N="508" REF="034476_0505_0FFDD94C15CF5408"/>
draw more stiffly, they dip them into water, which causes both the back of the bow and the string to contract, and consequently gives it the greater force; and as they practise from their youth, they shoot with very great dexterity." Voyage to Hudson's Bay, p. 138.</P>

<P>NECESSITY is the great prompter and guide of mankind in their inventions. There is, however, such inequality in some parts of their progress, and some nations get so far the start of others in circumstances nearly similar, that we must as∣cribe this to some events in their story, or to some peculiarity in their situation with which we are unacquainted. The people in the island of Otaheite, lately discovered in the South Sea, far excel most of the Americans in the knowledge and practice of the arts of ingenuity, and yet they had not invented any me∣thod of boiling water; and having no vessel that would bear the fire, they had no more idea that water could be made hot than that it could be made solid.

<P>A Remarkable proof of this is produced by Ulloa. In weav∣ing hammocks, coverlets, and the other coarse cloaths, which they are accustomed to manufacture, their industry has dis∣covered no more expeditious method, than to take up thread after thread, and after counting and sorting them each time, to pass the woof between them, so that in finishing a small piece of those stuffs, they frequently spend more than two years.

<P>BY the account which M.

Some solicited the honour with eagerness; others laboured to avoid their doom, and several saved their lives by fly∣ing to the woods. As the Indian Bramins give an intoxicating draught to the women, who are to be burnt together with the bo∣dies of their husbands, which renders them insensible of their ap∣proaching fate, the Natchez obliged their victims to swallow seve∣ral large pills of tobacco, which produce a similar effect.

At the same time he adds, "that it behoves their envoys or plenipotentiaries to exert their abilities and eloquence, for if the terms which they offer are not accepted of, they had need to stand on their guard. It frequently happens, that a blow with a hatchet is the only return given to their propositions. The envoy is not out of danger even if he is so fortunate as to avoid the stroke, he may expect to be pursued, and if taken, to be burnt." Hist. N. Fr. iii 251. What oc∣curs vol. ii. p. 277. concerning the manner in which the Tlasca∣lans treated the ambassadors from Zempoalla, corresponds with the fact related by Charlevoix. Men capable of such acts of violence, seem to be unacquainted with the first principles upon which the intercourse between nations is founded; and instead of the perpe∣tual negociations which Charlevoix mentions, it seems almost im∣possible that there should be any correspondence whatever among them.</P>

<P>AND, BERNALDES, the contemporary and friend of Co∣lumbus, has preserved some circumstances concerning the bravery of the Caribbees, which are not mentioned by Don Fer∣dinand Columbus, or the other historians of that period, whose works have been published. A Caribbean canoe, with four men, two women, and a boy, fell in unexpectedly with the fleet of Co∣lumbus in his second voyage, as it was steering through their islands. At first they were struck almost stupid with astonish∣ment
<PB N="512" REF="034476_0509_0FFDD956ABCE1898"/>
at such a strange spectacle, and hardly moved from the spot for above an hour. A Spanish bark, with twenty-five men, ad∣vanced towards them, and the fleet gradually surrounded them, so as to cut off their communication with the shore. "When they saw that it was impossible to escape (says the historian), they seized their arms, with undaunted resolution, and began the at∣tack. I use the express<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on <HI>with undaunted resolution,</HI> for they were few, and beheld a vast number ready to assault them. They wounded several of the Spaniards, although they had targets as well as other defensive armour; and even after their canoe was overset, it was with no little difficulty and danger that part of them were taken, as they continued to defend themselves, and to use their bows with great dexterity while swimming in the sea."

<P>A PROBABLE conjecture may be formed with respect to the cause of the distinction in character between the Carib∣bees and the inhabitants of the larger islands. The former appear manifestly to be a separate race. Their language is totally dif∣ferent from that of their neighbours in the large islands. They themselves have a tradition, that their ancestors came originally from some part of the continent, and having conquered and ex∣terminated the ancient inhabitants, took possession of their lands, and of their women. Rochefort, 384. Tertre, 360. Hence they call themselves <HI>Banaree,</HI> which signifies a man come from beyond sea. Labat. vi. 131. Accordingly, the Caribbees still use two distinct languages, one peculiar to the men and the other to the women. Tertre, 361. The language of the men has no∣thing common with that spoken in the large islands. The dialect of the women considerably resembles it. Labat. 129. This strongly confirms the tradition which I have mentioned. The Carribees themselves imagine, that they were a colony from the <HI>Galibis,</HI> a powerful nation of Guiana, in South America. Tertre, 361. Rochefort, 348. But as their fierce manners approach nearer to those of the people in the northern continent, than to those of the natives of South America; and as their language has likewise some affinity to that spoken in Florida, their origin should be deduced rather from the former than from the latter. Labat. 128, &amp;c. Herrera, dec. i. lib. ix. c. 4. In their wars, they still observe their ancient practice of destroying all the males, and preserving the women either for servitude or for breeding.</P>

<P>1518. Prepara∣tions of Velasquez for inva∣ding New Spain.</P></NOTE> he found the armament destined to attempt the con∣quest of that rich country which he had discovered, almost complete. Not only ambition, but avarice, had urged Velasquez to hasten his preparations; and having such a prospect of gratifying both, he had advanced considerable sums out of his private fortune towards defraying the expence of the expe∣dition. At the same time, he exerted his influence as governor, in engaging the most distinguished persons in the colony to undertake the service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE I.</NOTE>. At a time when the spirit of the Spanish nation was adventurous to excess, a number of soldiers, eager to embark in any daring enterprise, soon ap∣peared. But it was not easy to find a person qualified to take the command in an expedition of so much importance; and the character of Ve∣lasquez, who had the right of nomination, greatly increased the difficulty of the choice. Though of most aspiring ambition, and not destitute of talents for government, he possessed neither such courage,
<PB N="4" REF="034476_0512_0FFDD96785D0A5C0"/>
nor such vigour and activity of mind, as to under∣take in person the conduct of the armament which he was preparing. In this embarrassing situation, he formed the chimerical scheme, not only of atchieving great exploits by a deputy, but of se∣curing to himself the glory of conquests which were to be made by another. In the execution of this plan, he fondly aimed at reconciling contra∣dictions. He was solicitous to choose a commander of intrepid resolution, and of superior abilities, because he knew these to be requisite in order to ensure success; but at the same time, from the jealousy natural to little minds, he wished this per∣son to be of a spirit so tame and obsequious, as to be entirely dependant on his will. But when he came to apply those ideas in forming an opinion concerning the several officers who occurred to his thoughts as worthy of being intrusted with the command, he soon perceived that it was impossible to find such incompatible qualities united in one character. Such as were distinguished for courage and talents were too high-spirited to be passive in∣struments in his hands. Those who appeared more gentle and tractable, were destitute of capacity, and unequal to the charge. This augmented his perplexity and his fears. He deliberated long, and with much solicitude, and was still wavering in his choice, when Amador de Lares, the royal trea∣surer in Cuba, and Andres Duero, his own secre∣tary, the two persons in whom he chiefly confided, were encouraged by this irresolution to propose a new candidate, and they supported their recom∣mendation with such assiduity and address, that, no less fatally for Velasquez than happily for their country, it proved successful<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B.

<P><PB N="5" REF="034476_0513_0FFDD96BE499A8D0"/>THE man whom they pointed out to him was Fernando Cortes.

Being originally destined by his pa∣rents to the study of law, as the most likely method of b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttering his condition, he was sent early to the university of Salamanca, where he imbibed some tincture of learning. But he was soon disgusted with an academic life, which did not suit his ardent and restless genius, and re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to Medellin, where he gave himself up entirel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to active sports and martial exercises. At this period of life, he was so impetuous, so overbearing, and so dissipated, that his father was glad to comply with his incli∣nation, and send him abroad as an adventurer in arms. There were in that age two comple<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ous theatres, on which such of the Spanish youth as courted military glory might display their valour; one in Italy, under the command of the Great Captain; the other in the New World. Cortes preferred the former, but was prevented by indis∣position from embarking with a reinfor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ment of troops sent to Naples. Upon this di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>appointment he turned his views towards America, whither he was allured by the prospect of the advantages which he might derive from the patronage of O<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndo<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE II.</NOTE>, the governor of Hispaniola, who was his kinsman. When he landed at St. Domingo in one thousand five hundred and four, his reception was such as equalled his most sanguine hope<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and he was em∣ployed, by the governor in several honourable and l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>crative stations. These, however, did not sa∣tisfy his ambition; and in the year one thousand five hundred and eleven, he obtained permission to
<PB N="6" REF="034476_0514_0FFDD96E8011B340"/>
accompany Diego Velasquez in his expedition to Cuba. In this service he distinguished himself so much, that, notwithstanding some violent contests with Velasquez, occasioned by trivial events, un∣worthy of remembrance, he was at length taken into favour, and received an ample concession of lands and of Indians, the recompence usually bestowed upon adventurers in the New World<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gomara Chron. c. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THOUGH Cortes had not hitherto acted in high command, he had displayed such qualities in seve∣ral scenes of difficulty and danger, as raised uni∣versal expectation, and turned the eyes of his coun∣trymen towards him, as one capable of performing great things. The turbulence of youth, as soon as he found objects and occupations suited to the ardour of his mind, gradually subsided, and settled into a habit of regular indefatigable activity. The impetuosity of his temper, when he came to act with his equals, insensibly abated, by being kept under restraint, and mellowed into a cordial sol∣dierly frankness. These qualities were accompa∣nied with calm prudence in concerting his schemes, with persevering vigour in executing them, and with what is peculiar to superior genius, the art of gaining the confidence and governing the minds of men. To all which were added the inferior accom∣plishments that strike the vulgar, and command their respect; a graceful person, a winning aspect, extraordinary address in martial exercises, and a constitution of such vigour as to be capable of en∣during any fatigue.</P>
<P>AS soon as Cortes was mentioned to Velasquez by his two confidents, he flattered himself that he had at length found what he had hitherto sought in vain, a man with talents for command, but not an object for jealousy. Neither the rank nor the for∣tune
<PB N="7" REF="034476_0515_0FFDD9711B166ED8"/>
of Cortes, as he imagined, were such that he could aspire at independence. He had reason to believe that by his own readiness to bury ancient animosities in oblivion, as well as his liberality in conferring several recent favours, he had already gained the good-will of Cortes, and hoped, by this new and unexpected mark of confidence, that he might attach him for ever to his interest.</P>
<P>CORTES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Soon be∣comes jea∣lous of him.

His utmost influence and activity were exerted in per∣suading many of his friends to engage in the ser∣vice, and in urging forward the preparations for the voyage. All his own funds, together with what money he could raise by mortgaging his lands and Indians, were expended in purchasing military stores and provisions, or in supplying the wants of such of his officers as were unable to equip themselves in a manner suited to their rank<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE III.</NOTE>. Inoffensive, and even laudable as this conduct was, his disappointed competitors were malicious enough to give it a turn to his disadvantage. They repre∣sented him as aiming already, with little disguise, at establishing an independent authority over his troops, and endeavouring to secure their respect or love by his ostentatious and interested liberality. They reminded Velasquez of his former dissensions with the man in whom he now reposed so much confidence, and foretold that Cortes would be more apt to avail himself of the power, which the governor was inconsiderately putting in his hands, to avenge past injuries, than to requite recent obli∣gations. These insinuations made such impression
<PB N="8" REF="034476_0516_0FFDD974C94A18F8"/>
upon the suspicious mind of Velasquez, that Cortes soon observed some symptoms of a growing aliena∣tion and distrust in his behaviour, and was advised by Lares and Duero, to hasten his departure, be∣fore these should become so confirmed, as to break out with open violence. Fully sensible of this danger, he urged forward his preparations with such rapidity, that he set sail from St. Jago de Cuba on the eighteenth of November, Velasquez accompanying him to the shore, and taking leave of him with an appearance of perfect friendship and confidence, though he had secretly given it in charge to some of Cortes's officers, to keep a watchful eye upon every part of their commander's conduct <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gomara Cron. c. 7.

He had hardly left St. Jago, when the jealousy which had been working in the breast of Velasquez, grew so vio∣lent, that it was impossible to suppress it. The ar∣mament was no longer under his own eye and direction; and he felt, that as his power over it ceased, that of Cortes would become more abso∣lute. Imagination now aggravated every circum∣stance, which had formerly excited suspicion: the rivals of Cortes industriously threw in reflections which increased his fears; and with no less art than malice▪ they called superstition to their aid, employing the predictions of an astrologer in order to complete the alarm. All these, by their united operation, produced the desired effect. Velasquez repented bitterly of his own imprudence, in having committed a trust of so much importance to a per∣son
<PB N="9" REF="034476_0517_0FFDD976D424E7F8"/>
whose fidelity appeared so doubtful, and hastily dispatched instructions to Trinidad, empowering Verdugo, the chief magistrate there, to deprive Cortes of his commission. But Cortes had already made such progress in gaining the esteem and con∣fidence of his troops, that finding officers as well as soldiers equally zealous to support his authority, he soothed or intimidated Verdugo, and was permitted to depart from Trinidad without molestation.</P>
<P>FROM Trinidad Cortes sailed for the Havana,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and to lay him under arrest.</NOTE> in order to raise more soldiers, and to complete the victualling of his fleet. There several persons of distinction entered into the service, and engaged to supply what provisions were still wanting; but as it was necessary to allow them some time for performing what they had promised, Velasquez, sensible that he ought no longer to rely on a man of whom he had so openly discovered his distrust, availed himself of the interval, which this un∣avoidable delay afforded, in order to make one attempt more to wrest the command out of the hands of Cortes. He loudly complained of Ver∣dugo's conduct, accusing him either of childish facility, or of manifest treachery, in suffering Cortes to escape from Trinidad. Anxious to guard against a second disappointment, he sent a person of confidence to the Havana, with peremptory in∣junctions to Pedro Barba, his lieutenant-governor in that colony, instantly to arrest Cortes, to send him prisoner to St. Jago under a strong guard, and to countermand the sailing of the armament until he should receive farther orders. He wrote like∣wise to the principal officers, requiring them to assist Barba in executing what he had given him in charge. But before the arrival of his messenger, a Franciscan friar of St. Jaga had secretly conveyed an account of this interesting transaction to Bar∣tholomew

His first step was to find some pretext for removing from the Havana Diego de Ordaz, an officer of great me∣rit, but in whom, on account of his known at∣tachment to Velasquez, he could not confide in this trying and delicate juncture. He gave him the command of a vessel, destined to take on board some provisions, in a small harbour beyond Cape Antonio, and thus made sure of his absence, with∣out seeming to suspect his fidelity. When he was gone, Cortes no longer concealed the intentions of Velasquez from his troops; and as officers and sol∣diers were equally impatient to set out on an expe∣dition, in preparing for which most of them had expended all their fortunes, they expressed their astonishment and indignation at that illiberal jea∣lousy, to which the governor was about to sacri∣fice, not only the honour of their general, but all their sanguine hopes of glory and wealth. With one voice they intreated that he would not aban∣don the important station to which he had such a good title. They conjured him not to deprive them of the leader whom they followed with such well-founded confidence, and offered to shed the last drop of their blood in maintaining his autho∣rity. Cortes was easily induced to comply with what he himself so ardently desired. He swore that he would never desert soldiers who had given him such a signal proof of their attachment, and promised instantly to conduct them to that rich country, which had been so long the object of their thoughts and wishes. This declaration was received with transports of military applause, accompanied with threats and imprecations against all who should presume to call in question the jurisdiction of their

general, or to obstruct the execution of his de∣signs.</P>

The fleet consisted of eleven vessels; the largest of a hundred tons, which was dignified by the name of Admiral; three of seventy or eighty tons, and the rest small open barks. On board of these were six hundred and seventeen men; of which five hundred and eight belonged to the land service, and a hundred and nine were seamen or artificers. The soldiers were divided into eleven companies, according to the number of the ships; to each of which Cortes appointed a captain, and committed to him the command of the vessel while at sea, and of the men when on shore<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE IV.</NOTE>. As the use of fire-arms among the nations of Europe was hitherto confined to a few battalions of regularly disciplined infantry, only thirteen soldiers were armed with muskets, thirty-two were cross-bow men, and the rest had swords and spears. Instead of the usual defensive armour, which must have been cumbersome in a hot climata, the soldiers wore jackets quilted with cotton, which experience had taught the Spaniards to be a sufficient pro∣tection against the weapons of the Americans. They had only sixteen horses, ten small field-pieces, and four falconets<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">B. Diaz. c. 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="034476_0520_0FFDD97FB6FF4CC8"/>WITH this slender and ill-provided train did Cortes set sail, to make war upon a monarch whose dominions were more extensive than all the king∣doms subject to the Spanish crown.<NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>Feb. 10. 1519.</P>

<P>SO powerfully were Cortes and his followers ani∣mated with both these passions, that no less eager to plunder the opulent country whither they were bound, that zealous to propagate the Christian faith among its inhabitants, they set out, not with the solicitude natural to men going upon dangerous services, but with that confidence which arises from security of success, and certainty of the divine protection.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Touches at Cozumel;</NOTE>AS Cortes had determined to touch at every place which Grijalva had visited, he steered di∣rectly towards the island of Cozumel; there he had the good fortune to redeem Jerome de Agui∣lar, a Spaniard, who had been eight years a pri∣soner among the Indians.

After repeated endeavours to conciliate their good-will, he was constrained to have recourse to violence. Though the forces of
<PB N="13" REF="034476_0521_0FFDD9818B138E58"/>
the enemy were numerous, and advanced with ex∣traordinary courage, they were routed, with great slaughter, in several successive actions. The loss which they sustained, and still more the astonish∣ment and terror excited by the destructive effect of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>-arms, and the dreadful appearance of the horses, humbled their fierce spirits, and induced them to sue for peace.

<P>CORTES continued his course to the west ward,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrives at St. Juan de Ulua.</NOTE> keeping as near the shore as possible, in order to observe the country; but could discover no pro∣per place for landing, until he arrived at St. Juan de Ulua<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">B.

They came on board without fear or distrust, and ad∣dressed him in a most respectful manner, but in a language altogether unknown to Aguilar. Cortes was in the utmost perplexity and distress, at an event of which he instantly foresaw all the conse∣quences, and already felt the hesitation and uncer∣tainty with which he should carry on the great schemes which he meditated, if, in his transactions with the natives, he must depend entirely upon such an imperfect, ambiguous, and conjectural mode of communication, as the use of signs. But he did not remain long in his embarrassing situa∣tion: a fortunate accident extricated him, when his own sagacity could have contributed little to∣wards his relief. One of the female slaves, whom
<PB N="14" REF="034476_0522_0FFDD9853958C170"/>
he had received from the cazique of Tabasco, happened to be present at the first interview be∣tween Cortes and his new guests. She perceived his distress, as well as the confusion of Aguilar; and as she perfectly understood the Mexican lan∣guage, she explained what they had said in the Yucatan tongue, with which Aguilar was ac∣quainted. This woman, known afterwards by the name of Donna Marina, and who makes a con∣spicuous figure in the history of the New World, where great revolutions were brought about by small causes and inconsiderable instruments, was born in one of the provinces of the Mexican em∣pire. Having been sold as a slave in the early part of her life, after a variety of adventures she fell into the hands of the Tabascans, and had resided long enough among them to acquire their language, with out losing the use of her own. Though it was both tedious and troublesome to converse by the intervention of two different interpreters, Cortes was so highly pleased with having discovered this method of carrying on some intercourse with the people of a country into which he was determined to penetrate, that in the transports of his joy he considered it as a visible interposition of Providence in his favour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B Diaz. c. 37, 38, 39. Gomara Cron. c. 25, 26. Her∣rera, dec. 2. lib. v. c. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Lands his troops.</NOTE>HE now learned, that the two persons whom he had received on board of his ship were deputies from Teutile and Pilpatoe, two officers entrusted with the government of that province, by a great monarch, whom they called Montezuma; and that they were sent to inquire what his intentions were in visiting their coast, and to offer him what assist∣ance he might need, in order to continue his voyage. Cortes, struck with the appearance of
<PB N="15" REF="034476_0523_0FFDD987D4764800"/>
those people, as well as the tenor of the message, assured them, in respectful terms, that he approach∣ed their country with most friendly sentiments, and came to propose matters of great importance to the welfare of their prince and his kingdom, which he would unfold more fully, in person, to the go∣vernor and the general. Next morning, without waiting for any answer, he landed his troops, his horses, and artillery; and having chosen proper ground, began to erect huts for his men, and to fortify his camp. The natives, instead of op∣posing the entrance of those fatal guests into their country, assisted them in all their operations, with an alacrity of which they had ere long good reason to repent.</P>
<P>NEXT day Teutile and Pilpatoe entered the Spanish camp with a numerous retinue,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His first in∣terview with the Mexicans.</NOTE> and Cortes considering them as the ministers of a great mo∣narch, entitled to a degree of attention very dif∣ferent from that which the Spaniards were ac∣customed to pay to the petty caziques, with whom they had intercourse in the isles, received them with much formal ceremony. He informed them, that he came as ambassador from Don Car∣los of Austria, king of Castile, the greatest mo∣narch of the East, and was intrusted with propo∣sitions of such moment, that he could impart them to none but the emperor Montezuma himself, and therefore required them to conduct him, without loss of time, into the presence of their master. The Mexican officers could not conceal their un∣easiness at a request, which they knew would be disagreeable, and which they foresaw might prove extremely embarrassing to their sovereign, whose mind had been filled with many disquieting appre∣hensions, ever since the former appearance of the Spaniards to his coasts. But before they attempted to dissuade Cortes from insisting on this demand,
<PB N="16" REF="034476_0524_0FFDD98D2CFE91E8"/>
they endeavoured to conciliate his good-will, by entreating him to accept of certain presents, which, as humble slaves of Montezuma, they laid at his feet. They were introduced with great parade, and consisted of fine cotton cloth, of plumes of various colours, and of ornaments of gold and silver, to a considerable value; the workmanship of which appeared to be as curious as the materials were rich. The display of these produced an effect very different from what the Mexicans intended. Instead of satisfying, it increased the avidity of the Spaniards, and rendered them so eager and impa∣tient to become masters of a country which abounded with such precious productions, that Cortes could hardly listen with patience to the ar∣guments which Pilpatoe and Teutile employed to dissuade him from visiting the capital, and in a haughty determined tone he insisted on his demand, of being admitted to a personal audience of their sovereign. During this interview, some painters, in the train of the Mexican chiefs, had been dili∣gently employed in delineating, upon white cotton cloths, figures of the ships, the horses, the artil∣lery, the soldiers, and whatever else attracted their eyes, as singular. When Cortes observed this, and was informed that these pictures were to be sent to Montezuma, in order to convey to him a more lively idea of the strange and wonderful ob∣jects now presented to their view, than any words could communicate, he resolved to render the re∣presentation still more animated and interesting, by exhibiting such a spectacle as might give both them and their monarch an awful impression of the ex∣traordinary prowess of his followers, and the irre∣sistible force of their arms. The trumpets, by his order, sounded an alarm; the troops, in a moment, formed in order of battle, the infantry performed such martial exercises as were best suited to display
<PB N="17" REF="034476_0525_0FFDD98EC0298CB8"/>
the effect of their different weapons; the horse, in various evolutions, give a specimen of their agility and strength; the artillery, pointed towards the thick woods which surrounded the camp, were fired, and made dreadful havoc among the trees. The Mexicans looked on with that silent amaze∣ment which is natural when the mind is struck with objects, which are both awful and above its com∣prehension. But, at the explosion of the cannon, many of them fled, some fell to the ground, and all were so much confounded at the sight of men whose power so nearly resembled that of the gods, that Cortes found it difficult to compose and re∣assure them. The painters had now many new objects on which to exercise their art, and they put their fancy on the stretch in order to invent figures and symbols to represent the extraordinary things which they had seen.</P>
<P>MESSENGERS were immediately dispatched to Montezuma with those pictures,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negocia∣tions with Montesuma</NOTE> and a full account of every thing that had passed since the arrival of the Spaniards, and by them Cortes sent a present of some European curiosities to Montezuma, which though of no great value, he believed would be acceptable on account of their novelty. The Mexican monarchs, in order to obtain early in∣formation of every occurrence in all the corners of their extensive empire, had introduced a refinement in police, unknown, at that time, in Europe. They had couriers posted at proper stations along the principal roads; and as these were trained to agi∣lity by a regular education, and relieved one an∣other at moderate distances, they conveyed intel∣ligence with surprising rapidity. Though the ca∣pital in which Montezuma resided was above a hundred and eight miles from St. Juan de Ulua, Cortes's presents were carried thither, and an an∣swer to his demands was received in few days. The
<PB N="18" REF="034476_0526_0FFDD99261A265B8"/>
same officers who had hitherto treated with the Spaniards, were employed to deliver this answer; but as they knew how repugnant the determination of their master was to all the schemes and wishes of the Spanish commander, they would not venture to make it known until they had previously endea∣voured to sooth and mollify him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His pre∣sents.</NOTE> For this pur∣pose, they renewed their negociation, by introduc∣ing a train of a hundred Indians, loaded with pre∣sents sent to him by Montezuma. The magnifi∣cence of these was such as became a great monarch, and far exceeded any idea which the Spaniards had hitherto formed of his wealth. They were placed on mats spread on the ground, in such order, as shewed them to the greatest advantage. Cortes and his officers viewed, with admiration, the va∣rious manufactures of the country, cotton stuffs so fine, and of such delicate texture, as to resemble silk; pictures of animals, trees, and other natural objects, formed with feathers of different colours, disposed and mingled with such skill and elegance, as to rival the works of the pencil in truth and beauty of imitation. But what chiefly attracted their eyes, were two large plates of a circular form, one of massive gold representing the sun, the other of silver, an emblem of the moon <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE VI.</NOTE>. These were ac∣companied with bracelets, collars, rings, and other trinkets of gold; and that nothing might be wanting which could give the Spaniards a complete idea of what the country afforded, with some boxes filled with pearls, precious stones, and grains of gold un∣wrought, as they had been found in the mines or rivers. Cortes received all these with an appear∣ance of profound veneration for the monarch by whom they were bestowed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Forbids Cortes to approach his capital.</NOTE> But when the Mexi∣cans, presuming upon this, informed him, that their

master, though he desired him to accept of what he had sent as a token of regard for that monarch whom Cortes represented, would not give his con∣sent that foreign troops should approach nearer to his capital, or even to allow them to continue lon∣ger in his dominions, the Spanish general declared, in a manner more resolute and peremptory than formerly, that he must insist on his first demand, as he could not, without dishonour, return to his own country, until he was admitted into the pre∣sence of the prince whom he was appointed to visit in the name of his sovereign. The Mexicans, astonished at seeing any man dare to oppose that will, which they were accustomed to consider as supreme and irresistible, yet afraid of precipitating their country into an open rupture with such for∣midable enemies, prevailed with Cortes to promise, that he would not move from his present camp, until the return of a messenger, whom they sent to Montezuma for farther instructions <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B. Diaz. c. 39. Gomara Cron. c. 27. Herrera, dec 2. lib. v. c. 5, 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE firmness with which Cortes adhered to his original proposal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the Mexi∣can empire at that pe∣riod.</NOTE> should naturally have brought the negociation between him and Montezuma to a speedy issue, as it seemed to leave the Mexican monarch no choice, but either to receive him with confidence as a friend, or to oppose him openly as an enemy. The latter was what might have been expected from a haughty prince in possession of extensive power. The Mexican empire, at this period, was at a pitch of grandeur to which no so∣ciety ever attained in so short a period. Though it had subsisted, according to their own traditions, only a hundred and thirty years, its dominion ex∣tended from the North to the South Sea, over ter∣ritories stretching, with some small interruption,
<PB N="20" REF="034476_0528_0FFDD997711D1AD8"/>
above five hundred leagues from east to west, and more than two hundred from north to south, com∣prehending provinces not inferior in fertility, po∣pulation, and opulence, to any in the torrid zone. The people were warlike and enterprising; the au∣thority of the monarch unbounded, and his reve∣nues considerable. If, with the forces which might have been suddenly assembled in such an empire, Montezuma had fallen upon the Spaniards while encamped on a barren unhealthy coast, unsupported by any ally, without a place of retreat, and desti∣tute of provisions, it seems to be impossible, even with all the advantages of their superior discipline and arms, that they could have stood the shock, and they must either have perished in such an un∣equal contest, or have abandoned the enterprise.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of the mo∣narch.</NOTE>AS the power of Montezuma enabled him to take this spirited part, his own dispositions were such as seemed naturally to prompt him to it. Of all the princes who had swayed the Mexican sceptre, he was the most haughty, the most vio∣lent, and the most impatient of controul. His subjects looked up to him with awe, and his ene∣mies with terror. The former he governed with unexampled rigour, but they were impressed with such an opinion of his capacity, as commanded their respect; and, by many victories over the lat∣ter, he had spread far the dread of his arms, and had added several considerable provinces to his do∣minions. But though his talents might be suited to the transactions of a state so imperfectly polished as the Mexican empire, and sufficient to conduct them while in their accustomed course, they were altogether inadequate to a conjuncture so extraordi∣nary, and did not qualify him either to judge with the discernment, or to act with the decision, requi∣site in such trying emergence.</P>
<P>FROM the moment that the Spaniards appeared on his coast, he discovered symptoms of timidity
<PB N="21" REF="034476_0529_0FFDD99C213D79C8"/>
and embarrassment.

The perplexity and discomposure of Montezuma's mind upon this occasion, as well as the general dismay of his subjects, were not owing wholly to the impression which the Spaniards had made by the novelty of their appearance and the terror of their arms. Its original may be traced up to a more remote source. There was an opinion, if we may believe the earliest and most authentic Spanish historians, almost universal among the Americans, that some dreadful calamity was im∣pending over their heads, from a race of formi∣dable invaders who should come from regions to∣wards the rising sun, to overrun and desolate their country. Whether this disquieting apprehension flowed from the memory of some natural calamity which had afflicted that part of the globe, and im∣pressed the minds of the inhabitants with supersti∣tious fears and forebodings, or whether it was an imagination accidentally suggested by the astonish∣ment which the first sight of a new race of men o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>asioned, it is impossible to determine. But as the Mexicans were more prone to superstition than any people in the New World, they were more deeply affected by the appearance of the Spaniards, whom their cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lity instantly represented as the instrument destined to bring about this fatal revolu∣tion which they dreaded.

The Mexi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> counsellors took no effectual measure for expelling such troublesome intruders, and were satisfied with issuing a more possitive injunction, requiring them to leave the country; but this they preposterously accompanied with a present of such value, as proved fresh inducement to remain there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anxiety and appre∣hensions of the Spani∣ards.</NOTE>MEANWHILE, the Spaniards were not without solicitude or a variety of sentiments, in deliberating concerning their own future conduct. From what they had already seen, many of them formed such extravagant ideas concerning the opulence of the country, that despising danger or hardships, when they had in view treasures which appeared to be in∣exhaustible, they were eager to attempt the con∣quest. Others, estimating the power of the Mexi∣can empire by its wealth, and enumerating the va∣rious proofs which had occurred of its being under a well-regulated administration, contended, that it would be an act of the wildest frenzy to attack such a state with a small body of men, in want of provi∣sions, unconnected with any ally, and already en∣feebled by the diseases peculiar to the climate, and

the loss of several of their number<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B. Diaz. c. 40.</NOTE>. Cortes se∣cretly applauded the advocates for bold measures, and cherished their romantic hopes, as such ideas corresponded with his own, and favoured the exe∣cution of the schemes which he had formed. From the time that the suspicions of Velasquez broke out with open violence in the attempts to deprive him of the command. Cortes saw the necessity of dis∣solving a connection which would obstruct and em∣barrass all his operations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Schemes of Cortes.</NOTE> and watched for a proper opportunity of coming to a final rupture with him. Having this in view, he had laboured by every art to secure the esteem and affection of his soldiers. With his abilities for command, it was easy to gain their esteem; and his followers were quickly satis∣fied that they might rely, with perfect confidence, on the conduct and courage of their leader. Nor was it more difficult to acquire their affection. Among adventurers, nearly of the same rank, and serving at their own expence, the dignity of com∣mand did not elevate a general above mingling with those who acted under him. Cortes availed himself of this freedom of entercourse, to insinuate himself into their favour, and by his affable manners, by well-timed acts of liberality to some, by inspiring all with vast hopes, and by allowing them to trade privately with the natives<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE VII.</NOTE>, he attached the greater part of his soldiers so firmly to himself, that they almost forgot that the armament had been fitted out by the authority, and at the expence, of an∣other.</P>
<P>DURING those intrigues,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His address in carrying them on</NOTE> Teutile arrived with the present from Montezuma, and, together with it, delivered the ultimate order of that monarch to de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t instantly out of his dominions; and when Cortes, instead of complying, renewed his request

of an audience, the Mexican turned from him ab∣ruptly, and quitted the camp with looks and ges∣tures which strongly expressed his surprise and re∣sentment. Next morning, none of the natives, who used to frequent the camp in great numbers, in order to barter with the soldiers, and to bring in provisions, appeared. All friendly correspondence seemed now to be at an end, and it was expected every moment that hostilities would commence. This, though an event that might have been fore∣seen, occasioned a sudden consternation among the Spaniards, which emboldened the adherents of Velasquez not only to murmur and cabal against their general, but to appoint one of their number to remonstrate openly against his imprudence in at∣tempting the conquest of a mighty empire with such inadequate force, and to urge the necessity of returning to Cuba, in order to refit the fleet and augment the army. Diego de Ordaz, one of his principal officers, whom the malecontents charged with this commission, delivered it with a soldierly freedom and bluntness, assuring Cortes that he spoke the sentiments of the whole army. He listened to this remonstrance without any appearance of emo∣tion, and as he well knew the temper and wishes of his soldiers, and foresaw how they would receive a proposition fatal at once to all the splendid hopes and schemes which they had been forming with such complacency, he carried his dissimulation so far as to seem to relinquish his own measures in com∣pliance with the request of Ordaz, and issued orders that the army should be in readiness next day to reimbark for Cuba. As soon as this was known, the disappointed adventurers exclaimed and threat∣ened; the emissaries of Cortes, mingling with them, inflamed their rage; the ferment became general; the whole camp was almost in open mutiny; all demanding with eagerness to see their commander.
<PB N="25" REF="034476_0533_0FFDD9A4CAE31818"/>
Cortes was not slow in appearing; when, with one voice, officers and soldiers expressed their astonish∣ment and indignation at the orders which they had received. It was unworthy, they cried,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1518.</NOTE> of the Cas∣tilian courage, to be daunted at the first aspect of danger, and infamous to sly before any enemy ap∣peared. For their parts, they were determined not to relinquish an enterprise, that had hitherto been successful, and which tended so visibly to spread the knowledge of true religion, and to ad∣vance the glory and interest of their country. Happy under his command, they would follow him with alacrity through every danger, in quest of those settlements and treasures which he had so long held out to their view; but if he chose rather to return to Cuba, and tamely give up all his hopes of distinction and opulence to an envious rival, they would instantly choose another general to conduct them in that path of glory, which he had not spirit to enter.</P>
<P>CORTES, delighted with their ardour, took no offence at the boldness with which it was uttered. The sentiments were what he himself had inspired, and the warmth of expression satisfied him that his followers had imbibed them thoroughly. He af∣fected, however, to be surprised at what he heard, declaring that his orders to prepare for embarking were issued from a persuasion that this was agree∣able to his troops; that, from deference to what he had been informed was their inclination, he had sacrificed his own private opinion, which was firmly bent on establishing immediately a settlement on the sea-coast, and then on endeavouring to pene∣trate into the interior part of the country; that now he was convinced of his error; and as he perceived that they were animated with the generous spirit which breathed in every true Spaniard, he would resume, with fresh ardour, his original plan of ope∣ration,

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Establishes a form of civil go∣vernment.</NOTE>WITHOUT allowing his men time to cool or to reflect, Cortes set about carrying his design into execution. In order to give a beginning to a co∣lony, he assembled the principal persons in his army, and by their suffrage elected a council and magistrates in whom the government was to be vested. As men naturally transplant the institutions and forms of the mother-country into their new settlements, this was framed upon the model of a Spanish corporation. The magistrates were dis∣tinguished by the same names and ensigns of office, and were to exercise a similar jurisdiction. All the persons chosen were most firmly devoted to Cortes, and the instrument of their election was framed in the king's name, without any mention of their de∣pendance on Velasquez. The two principles of avarice and enthusiasm, which prompted the Spa∣niards to all their enterprises in the New World, seem to have concurred in suggesting the name which Cortes bestowed on his infant settlement.

respect, which added dignity to the tribunal, and set an example of reverence for its authority, he began a long harangue, in which, with much art, and in terms extremely flattering to persons just entering upon their new function, he observed, that as the supreme jurisdiction over the colony which they had planted was now vested in this court, he considered them as clothed with the authority, and representing the person of their sovereign; that ac∣cordingly he would communicate to them what he deemed essential to the public safety, with the same dutiful fidelity as if he were addressing his royal master; that the security of a colony settled in a great empire, whose sovereign had already discovered his hostile intentions, depended upon arms, and the efficacy of these upon the subordination and disci∣pline preserved among the troops; that his right to command was derived from a commission granted by the governor of Cuba; and as that had been long since revoked, the lawfulness of his jurisdic∣tion might well be questioned; that he might be thought to act upon a defective, or even a du∣bious title; nor could they trust an army which might dispute the powers of its general, at a junc∣ture when it ought implicity to obey his orders; that, moved by these considerations, he now re∣signed all his authority to them, that they, having both right to choose, and power to confer full ju∣risdiction, might appoint one, in the king's name, to command the army in its future operations; and as for his own part, such was his zeal for the ser∣vice in which they were engaged, that he would most cheerfully take up a pike with the same hand that laid down the general's truncheon, and con∣vince his fellow-soldiers, that though accustomed to command, he had not forgotten how to obey. Having finished his discourse, he laid the commis∣sion from Velasquez upon the table, and after kissing

His resignation was accepted; and as the uninterrupted tenor of their prosperity under his conduct afforded the most satisfying evidence of his abilities for command, they, by their unanimous suffrage, elected him chief justice of the colony, and captain-general of its army, and appointed his com∣mission to be made out in the king's name, with most ample powers, which were to continue in force until the royal pleasure should be farther known. That this deed might not be deemed the machina∣tion of a junto, the council called together the troops, and acquainted them with what had been resolved.

To this he was encouraged by an event no less fortunate than seasonable. Some Indians having approached his camp in a mysterious manner, were introduced into his presence.

great distance; and from their answers to a variety of questions which he put to them, according to his usual practice in every enterview with the peo∣ple of the country, he gathered, that their master, though subject to the Mexican empire, was im∣patient of the yoke, and filled with such dread and hatred of Montezuma, that nothing could be more acceptable to him than any prospect of deliverance from the oppression under which he groaned. On hearing this, a ray of light and hope broke in upon the mind of Cortes. He saw that the great em∣pire which he intended to attack was neither per∣fectly united, nor its sovereign universally beloved. He concluded, that the causes of disaffection could not be confined to one province, but that in other corners there must be malcontents, so weary of subjection, or so desirous of change, as to be rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y to follow the standard of any protector.

From him he learned many particulars with respect to the character of Montezuma, and the circumstances which rendered his dominion odious. He was a tyrant, as the cazique told him with tears, haughty, cruel, and suspicious; who treated his own subjects with arrogance, ruined the con∣quered provinces by excessive exactions, and often tore their sons and daughters from them by violence; the former to be offered as victims to his gods; the latter, to be reserved as concubines for himself or favorites. Cortes, in reply to him, artfully insinuated, that one great object of the Spaniards in visiting a country so remote from their own, was to redress grievances, and to relieve the oppressed; and having encouraged him to hope for this inter∣position in due time, he continued his march to Quiabislan.</P>
<P>THE spot which his officers had recommended as a proper situation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Build<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fort.</NOTE> appeared to him to be so well chosen, that he immediately marked out ground for a town. The houses to be erected were only huts; but these were to be surrounded with fortifi∣cations, of sufficient strength to resist the assaults of an Indian army. As the finishing of those fortifi∣cations was essential to the existence of a colony, and of no less importance in prosecuting the de∣signs which the leader and his followers meditated, both in order to secure a place of retreat, and to preserve their communication with the sea, every man in the army, officers as well as soldiers, put his hand to the work, Cortes himself setting them an example of activity and perseverance in labour.

Some of Mon∣tezuma's officers having appeared to levy the usual tribute, and to demand a certain number of human victims, as an expiation for their guilt in presu∣ming to hold intercourse with those strangers whom the emperor had commanded to leave his domi∣nions, instead of obeying the order, the caziques made them prisoners, treated them with great in∣dignity, and, as their superstition was no less barba∣rous than that of the Mexicans, they prepared to sacrifice them to their gods. From this last dan∣ger they were delivered by the interposition of Cortes, who manifested the utmost horror at the mention of such a deed. The two caziques hav∣ing now been published to an act of such open re∣bellion, as left them no hope of safety but in attach∣ing themselves inviolably to the Spaniards, they soon completed their union with them, by for∣mally acknowledging themselves to be vassals of the same monarch. Their example was followed by the Totonaques, a fierce people who inhabited the mountainous part of the country. They wil∣lingly subjected themselves to the crown of Castile, and offered to accompany Cortes, with all their forces, in his march towards Mexico<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">B. Diaz. c. 47.

By his ad∣dress in conducting his intrigues with his own army, as well as his fagacity in carrying on his negociations with the natives, he had already laid the foundations of his future success. But what∣ever confidence he might place in the plan which he had formed, he could not but perceive, that as his title to command was derived from a doubtful authority, he held it but a precarious tenure. The injuries which Velasquez had received, were such as would naturally prompt him to apply for redress to their common sovereign; and such a representa∣tion, he foresaw, might be given of his conduct, that he had reason to apprehend, not only that he might be degraded from his present rank, but sub∣jected to punishment. Before he began his march, it was necessary to take the most effectual precau∣tions against this impending danger. With this view he persuaded the magistrates of the colony at Vera Cruz to address a letter to the king, the chief object of which was to justify their own conduct in establishing a colony independent on the jurisdic∣tion of Velasquez. In order to accomplish this, they endeavoured to detract from his merit, in fit∣ting out the two former armaments under Cordova and Grijalva, affirming that these had been equipped by the adventurers who engaged in the expedi∣tions, and not by the governor. They contended that the sole object of Velasquez was to trade or barter with the natives, not to attempt the con∣quest of New Spain, or to settle a colony there. They asserted that Cortes and the officers who served under him had defrayed the greater part of the expence in fitting out the armament. On this

account, they humbly requested their sovereign to ratify what they had done in his name, and to con∣firm Cortes in the supreme command by his royal commission. That Charles might be induced to grant more readily what they demanded, they give him a pompous description of the country which they had discovered; of its riches, the number of its inhabitants, their civilization and arts; they re∣late the progress which they had already made in annexing some parts of the country situated on the sea-coast to the crown of Castile; and mention the schemes which they had formed, as well as the hopes which they entertained, of reducing the whole to subjection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In this letter it is asserted, that though a considerable number of Spaniards have been wounded in their various encounters with the people of Tobasco, not one of them died, and all had reco∣vered in a very short time.

<P>WHILE a vessel was preparing for their de∣parture, an unexpected event occasioned a gene∣ral alarm.

This conspiracy, though formed by persons of low rank, was conducted with profound secrecy; but at the moment when every thing was ready for execution, they were betrayed by one of their associates.</P>
<P>THOUGH the good fortune of Cortes interposed so seasonably on this occasion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He destroys his fleet.</NOTE> the detection of this conspiracy filled his mind with most disquieting apprehensions, and prompted him to execute a scheme which he had long revolved. He per∣ceived that the spirit of disaffection still lurked among his troops; that though hitherto checked by the uniform success of his schemes, or sup∣pressed by the hand of authority, various events might occur which would encourage and call it

forth. He observed, that many of his men, weary of the fatigue of service, longed to revisit their set∣tlements in Cuba; and that upon any appearance of extraordinary danger, or any reverse of fortune, it would be impossible to restrain them from return∣ing thither. He was sensible that his forces, al∣ready too feeble, could bear no diminution, and that a very small defection of his followers would oblige him to abandon the enterprise. After ru∣minating often, and with much solicitude, upon those particulars, he saw no hope of success, but in cutting off all possibility of retreat, and in re∣ducing his men to the necessity of adopting the same resolution with which he himself was ani∣mated, either to conquer or to perish. With this view, he determined to destroy his fleet; but as he durst not venture to execute such a bold resolution by his single authority, he laboured to bring his soldiers to adopt his ideas with respect to the pro∣priety of this measure. His address in accomplish∣ing this was not inferior to the arduous occasion in which it was employed. He persuaded some, that the ships had suffered so much by having been long at sea, as to be altogether unfit for service; to others he pointed out what a seasonable reinforce∣ment of strength they would derive from the junc∣tion of an hundred men, now unprofitably employ∣ed as sailors; and to all, he represented the neces∣sity of fixing their eyes and wishes upon what was be∣fore them, without allowing the idea of a retreat once to enter their thoughts. With universal con∣sent the ships were drawn ashore, and after strip∣ing them of their sails, rigging, iron works, and whatever else might be of use, they were broke in pieces. Thus, from an effort of magnanimity, to which there is nothing parallel in history, five hun∣dred men voluntarily consented to be shut up in a hostile country, filled with powerful and unknown

<P>NOTHING now retarded Cortes; the alacrity of his troops and the disposition of his allies were equally favourable. All the advantages, however, derived from the latter, though procured by much assiduity and address, were well nigh lost in a mo∣ment, by an indiscreet sally of religious zeal, which, on many occasions, precipitated Cortes into actions inconsistent with the prudence that distinguishes his character. Though hitherto he had neither time nor opportunity to explain to the natives the errors of their own superstition, or to instruct them in the principles of the Christian faith, he com∣manded his soldiers to overturn the altars and to destroy the idols in the chief temple of Zempoalla, and in their place to erect a crucifix and an image of the Virgin Mary. The people beheld this with astonishment and horror; the priests excited them to arms; but such was the authority of Cortes, and so great the ascendant which the Spaniards had acquired, that the commotion was appeased with∣out bloodshed, and concord perfectly re-esta∣blished<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">B.

<P>CORTES began his march from Zempoalla on the sixteenth of August, with five hundred men,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advances into the country.</NOTE> fifteen horse, and six field-pieces.

The cazique of Zempoalla supplied him with provisions, and with two hundred of those Indians called <HI>Tamemes,</HI> whose office, in a country where

tame animals were unknown, was to carry burdens; and to perform all servile labour. They were a great relief to the Spanish soldiers, who hitherto had been obliged, not only to carry their own bag∣gage, but to drag along the artillery by main force. He offered likewise a considerable body of his troops, but Cortes was satisfied with four hundred; taking care, however, to chuse persons of such note as might prove hostages for the fidelity of their master. Nothing memorable happened in his pro∣gress, until he arrived on the confines of Tlascala. The inhabitants of that province, a warlike people, were implacable enemies of the Mexicans, and had been united in an ancient alliance with the caziques of Zompoalla. Though less civilized than the subjects of Montezuma, they were advanced in improvement far beyond the rude nations of Ame∣rica, whose manners we have described. They had made considerable progress in agriculture; they dwelt in large towns: they were nor strangers to some species of commerce; and in the imperfect accounts of their institutions and laws, transmitted to us by the early Spanish writers, we discern traces both of distributive justice and of criminal jurisdic∣tion, in their interior police. But still, as the de∣gree of their civilization was incomplete, and as they depended for subsistence not on agriculture alone, but trusted for it, in a great measure, to hunting, they retained many of the qualities natu∣ral to men in this state. Like them, they were fierce and revengeful; like them, too, they were high-spirited and independent. In consequence of the former, they were involved in peapetual hostili∣ties, and had but a slender and occasional inter∣course with neighbouring states. The latter inspired them with such detestation of servitude, that they not only refused to stoop to a foreign yoke, and maintained an obstinate and successful contest in de∣fence
<PB N="39" REF="034476_0547_0FFDD9BC3740E9A8"/>
of their liberty against the superior power of the Mexican empire, but they guarded with equal solicitude against domestic tyranny; and disdaining to acknowledge any master, they lived under the mild and limited jurisdiction of a council elected by their several tribes.</P>
<P>CORTES,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His war with the Tlasca∣lans.</NOTE> though he had received information concerning the martial character of this people, flattered himself that his professions of delivering the oppressed from the tyranny of Montezuma, their inveterate enmity to the Mexicans, and the example of their ancient allies the Zempoallans, might induce the Tlascalans to grant him a friendly reception. In order to dispose them to this, four Zempoallans of great eminence were sent ambas∣sadors, to request, in his name, and in that of their cazique, that they would permit the Spaniards to pass through the territories of the republic in their way to Mexico. But instead of the favourable answer which was expected, the Tlascalans seized the ambassadors, and, without any regard to their public character, made preparations for sacrificing them to their gods. At the same time, they assem∣bled their troops, in order to oppose those un∣known invaders, if they should attempt to make their passage good by force of arms. Various mo∣tives concurred in precipitating the Tlascalans into this resolution. A fierce people, shut up within its own narrow precincts, and little accustomed to any intercourse with foreigners, is apt to consider every stranger as an enemy, and is easily excited to arms. They concluded, from Cortes's proposal of visiting Montezuma in his capital, that, not∣withstanding all his professions, he courted the friendship of a monarch whom they both hated and feared. The imprudent zeal of Cortes in violating the temples in Zempoalla, filled the Tlascalans with horror; and as they were no less attached to their
<PB N="40" REF="034476_0548_0FFDD9BED23F0540"/>
superstition than the other nations of New Spain, they were impatient to avenge their injured gods, and to acquire the merit of offering up to them, as victims, those impious men who had dared to pro∣fane their altars; they contemned the small num∣ber of the Spaniards, as they had not yet measured their own strength with that of these new enemies, and had no idea of the superiority which they de∣rived from their arms and discipline.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Aug. 30. Success of it.</NOTE>CORTES, after waiting some days, in vain, for the return of his ambassadors, advanced into the Tlascalan territories. As the resolutions of people who delight in war are executed with no less promptitude than they are formed, he found troops in the field ready to oppose him. They attacked him with great intrepidity, and, in the first encoun∣ter, wounded some of the Spaniards, and killed two horses; a loss, in their situation, of great mo∣ment, because it was irreparable. From this spe∣cimen of their courage, Cortes saw the necessity of proceeding with caution. His army marched in close order; he chose the stations, where he halted, with attention, and fortified every camp with ex∣traordinary care. During fourteen days he was exposed to almost uninterrupted assaults, the Tlas∣calans advancing with numerous armies, and re∣newing the attack in various forms, with a degree of valour and perseverance to which the Spaniards had seen nothing parallel in the New World. The Spanish historians describe those successive battles with great pomp, and enter into a minute detail of particulars, mingling many exaggerated and in∣credible circumstances<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE IX.</NOTE>, with such as are real and marvellous. But no power of words can render the recital of a combat interesting, where there is no equality of danger; and when the narrative
<PB N="41" REF="034476_0549_0FFDD9C182EA75C0"/>
closes with an account of thousands slain on the one side,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1518.</NOTE> while not a single person falls on the other, the most laboured descriptions of the previous disposi∣tion of the troops, or of the various vicissitudes in the engagement, command no attention.</P>
<P>THERE are some circumstances, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Some sin∣gular cir∣cumstances in it.</NOTE> in this war, which are memorable, and merit no∣tice, as they throw light upon the character both of the people of New Spain, and of their con∣querors. Though the Tlascalans brought into the field such numerous armies as appear sufficient to have overwhelmed the Spaniards, they were never able to make any impression upon their small batta∣lion. Singular as this may seem, it is not inexpli∣cable. The Tlascalans, though addicted to war, were, like all unpolished nations, strangers to mi∣litary order and discipline, and lost in a great mea∣sure the advantage which they might have derived from their numbers, and the impetuosity of their attack, by their constant solicitude to carry off the dead and wounded. This point of honour, founded on a sentiment of tenderness natural to the human mind, and strengthened by anxiety to pre∣serve the bodies of their countrymen from being devoured by their enemies, was universal among the people of New Spain. Attention to this pious office occupied them even during the heat of com∣bat<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B. Diaz. c. 65.</NOTE>, broke their union, and diminished the force of the impression which they might have made by a joint effort.</P>
<P>NOT only was their superiority in number of little avail, but the imperfection of their military weapons rendered their valour in a great measure inoffensive. After three battles, and many skir∣mishes and assaults, not one Spaniard was killed in the field. Arrows and spears, headed with flint
<PB N="42" REF="034476_0550_0FFDD9C37AC1E690"/>

The Tlascalans advanced boldly to the charge, and often fought hand to hand. Many of the Spaniards were wounded, though all slightly, which cannot be imputed to any want of courage or strength in their enemies, but to the defect of the arms with which they assailed them.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the fury with which the Tlascalans attacked the Spaniards, they seem to have conducted their hostilities with some degree of barbarous generosity. They gave the Spaniards warning of their hostile intentions, and as they knew that their invaders wanted provisions, and imagined, perhaps, like the other Americans, that they had left their own country because it did not afford them subsistence, they sent to their camp a large supply of poultry and maize, desiring them to eat plentifully, because they scorned to attack an enemy enfeebled by hunger, and it would be an affront to their Gods to offer them famished vic∣tims, as well as disagreeable to themselves to feed on such emaciated prey<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. vi. c. 6.

<P>WHEN they were taught by the first encounter with their new enemies, that it was not easy to exe∣cute this threat; when they perceived, in the sub∣sequent engagements, that notwithstanding all the efforts of their own valour, of which they had a very high opinion, not one of the Spaniards was slain or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aken, they began to conceive them a supe∣rior order of beings, against whom human power could not avail. In this extremity, they had re∣course to their priests, requiring them to reveal the mysterious causes of such extraordinary events,
<PB N="43" REF="034476_0551_0FFDD9A97519CFA0"/>
and to declare what new means they should employ in order to repulse those formidable invaders. The priests, after many sacrifices and incantations, de∣livered this response. That these strangers were the offspring of the sun, procreated by his ani∣mating energy in the regions of the east; that, by day, while cherished with the influence of his pa∣rental beams, they were invincible, but by night, when his reviving heat was withdrawn, their vigour declined and faded like the herbs in the field, and they dwindled down into mortal men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B. Diaz. c. 66.</NOTE>. Theories less plausible have gained credit with more enlightened nations, and have influenced their conduct. In consequence of this, the Tlascalans, with the im∣plicit confidence of men who fancy themselves to be under the guidance of heaven, acted in con∣tradiction to one of their most established maxims in war, and ventured to attack the enemy, with a strong body, in the night-time, in hopes of destroy∣ing them when enfeebled and surprised. But Cortes had greater vigilance and discernment than to be deceived by the rude stratagems of an Indian army. The centinels at his out posts, observing some ex∣traordinary movement among the Tlascalans, gave the alarm. In a moment the troops were under arms, and sallying out, dispersed the party with great slaughter, without allowing it to approach the camp. The Tlascalans, convinced, by sad expe∣rience, that their priests had deluded them, and satisfied that they attempted in vain, either to de∣ceive or to vanquish their enemies, their fierceness abated, and they began to incline seriously to peace.</P>

of a gentle or of a malevolent nature. There were circumstances in their conduct which seemed to fa∣vour each opinion. On the one hand, as the Spa∣niards constantly dismissed the prisoners whom they took, not only without injury, but often with pre∣sents of European toys, and renewed their offers of peace after every victory; this lenity amazed people, who, according to the exterminating system of war known in America, were accustomed to sa∣crifice and devour without mercy all the captives taken in battle, and disposed them to entertain fa∣vourable sentiments of the humanity of their new enemies. But, on the other hand, as Cortes had seized-fifty of their countrymen who brought pro∣visions to his camp, and, supposing them to be spies, had cut off their hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat.

This uncertainty was apparent in the mode of addressing the Spaniards. " If, said they, you are divinities of a cruel and savage nature, we present to you five slaves, that you may drink their blood, and eat their flesh.

They all considered themselves as instruments employed by Heaven to propagate the Christian faith, and the less they were qualified, either by their knowledge or morals, for such a function, they were more eager to discharge it. The pro∣found veneration of the Tlascalans for the Spaniards, having encouraged Cortes to explain to some of their chiefs the doctrines of the Christian religion, and to insist that they should abandon their own superstitions, and embrace the faith of their new friends, they, according to an idea universal among barbarous nations, readily acknowledged the truth and excellence of what he taught; but contended, that the <HI>Teules</HI> of Tlascala were divinities no less than the God in whom the Spaniards believed; and as that Being was entitled to the homage of Euro∣peans, so they were bound to revere the same powers which their ancestors had worshipped. Cortes continued, nevertheless, to urge his de∣mand in a tone of authority, mingling threats with his arguments, until the Tlascalans could bear it no longer, and conjured him never to mention this again, lest the gods should avenge on their heads the guilt of having listened to such a proposition.

He repre∣sented the imprudence of such an attempt in a large city newly reconciled, and filled with people no less superstitious than warlike; he declared, that the proceeding at Zempoalla had always appeared to him precipitate and unjust; that religion was not to be propagated by the sword, or infidels to be con∣verted by violence; that other weapons were to be

The re∣monstrances of an ecclesiastic, no less respectable for wisdom than virtue, had their proper weight with Cortes.

Montezuma seems to have invited the Spaniards thither, either from some superstitious hope that the gods would not suffer this sacred mansion to be de∣filed, without pouring down their wrath upon those impious strangers, who ventured to insult their power in the place of its peculiar residence; or from a belief that he himself might there attempt to cut them off with more certain success, under the immediate protection of his divinities.</P>

He himself, though re∣ceived into the town with much seeming respect and cordiality, observed several circumstances in their conduct which excited suspicion. Two of the Tlascalans, who were encamped at some distance from the town, as the Cholulans refused to admit their ancient enemies within its precincts, having found means to enter in disguise, acquainted Cortes, that they observed the women and children of the principal cities retiring in great hurry every night; and that six children had been sacrificed in the chief temple, a rite which indicated the execution of some warlike enterprise to be approaching. At the same time, Marina the interpreter received in∣formation from an Indian woman of distinction, whose confidence she had gained, that the destruc∣tion of her friends was concerted; that a body of Mexican troops lay concealed near the town; that some of the streets were barricaded, and in others, pits or deep trenches were dug, and slightly co∣vered over, as traps into which the horses might

fall; that stones or missive weapons were collected on the tops of the temples, with which to overwhelm the infantry▪ that the fatal hour was now at hand, and their ruin unavoidable. Cortes, alarmed at this concurring evidence, secretly arrested three of the chief priests, and extorted from them a confes∣sion, that confirmed the intelligence which he had received. As not a moment was to be lost, he in∣stantly resolved to prevent his enemies, and to in∣flict on them such dreadful vengeance as might strike Montezuma and his subjects with terror. For this purpose, the Spaniards and Zempoallans were drawn up in a large court, which had been al∣lotted for their quarters, near the centre of the town; the Tlascalans had orders to advance; the magistrates, and several of the chief citizens were sent for, under various pretexts, and seized. On a signal given, the troops rushed out, and fell upon the multitude, destitute of leaders, and so much astonished, that the weapons dropping from their hands, they stood motionless, and incapable of de∣fence. While the Spaniards pressed them in front, the Tlascalans attacked them in the rear. The streets were filled with bloodshed and death. The temples, which afforded a retreat to the priests and some of the lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing men, were set on fire, and they perished in the flames. This scene of horror con∣tinued two days; during which, the wretched in∣habitants suffered all that the destructive rage of the Spaniards, or the implacable revenge of their Indian allies, could inflict. At length the carnage ceases, after the slaughter of six thousand Cholulans, with∣out the loss of a single Spaniard. Cortes then re∣leased the magistrates, and reproaching them bit∣terly for their intended treachery, declared, that as justice was now appeased, he forgave the offence, but required them to recal the citizens who had fled, and re-establish order in the town. Such was
<PB N="51" REF="034476_0559_0FFDD9D8D7CE2D60"/>
the ascendant which the Spaniards had acquired over this superstitious race of men, and so deeply were they impressed with an opinion of their supe∣rior discernment, as well as power, that, in obedi∣ence to this command, the city was in a few days filled again with people, who, amidst the ruins of their sacred buildings, yielded respectful service to men, whose hands were stained with the blood of their relations and fellow-citizens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat.

<P>FROM Cholula,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 29. Advances towards Mexico.</NOTE> Cortes advanced directly towards Mexico, which was only twenty leagues distant.

When Cortes first ob∣served the seeds of discontent in the remote pro∣vinces of the empire, hope dawned upon his mind; but when he now discovered such symptoms of alienation from their monarch near the seat of go∣vernment, he concluded that the vital parts of the constitution were affected, and conceived the most sanguine expectations of overturning a state, whose natural strength was thus divided and impaired. While those reflections encouraged the general to persist in his arduous undertaking, the soldiers were no less animated by observations more obvious to their capacity. In descending from the mountains of Chalco, across which the road lay, the vast plain of Mexico opened gradually to their view.<NOTE PLACE="marg">First view of it.</NOTE> When they first beheld this prospect, one of the most striking and beautiful on the face of the earth;

As they advanced, their doubts were removed, but their amazement increased. They were now fully satisfied that the country was rich beyond any conception which they had formed of it, and flattered themselves that at length they should obtain an ample recompence for all their services and sufferings.</P>

Many messengers arrived successively from Montezuma, permitting them one day to advance, requiring them on the next to retire, as his hopes or fears alter∣nately prevailed; and so wonderful was this infatu∣ation, which seems to be unaccountable on any sup∣position but that of a superstitious dread of the Spa∣niards, as beings of a superior nature, that Cortes was almost at the gates of the capital, before the monarch had determined whether to receive him as a friend, or to oppose him as an enemy. But as no sign of open hostility appeared, the Spaniards, with∣out regarding the fluctuations of Montezuma's sen∣timents, continued their march along the causeway which led to Mexico through the lake, with great

<P>WHEN they drew near the city,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is first in∣terview with the Spaniards.</NOTE> about a thousand persons, who appeared to be of distinction, came forth to meet them, adorned with plumes, and clad in mantles of fine cotton. Each of these, in his order, passed by Cortes, and saluted him accord∣ing to the mode deemed most respectful and sub∣missive in their country. They announced the ap∣proach of Montezuma himself, and soon after his harbingers came in sight. There appeared first two hundred persons in an uniform dress, with large plumes of feathers, alike in fashion, marching two and two, in deep silence, bare-footed, with their eyes fixed on the ground. These were followed by a company of higher rank, in their most showy apparel, in the midst of whom was Montezuma, in a chair or litter richly ornamented with gold, and feathers of various colours. Four of his principal favourites carried him on their shoulders, others supported a canopy of curious workmanship over his head. Before him marched three officers with rods of gold in their hands, which they lifted up on high at certain intervals, and at that signal all the people bowed their heads, and hid their faces, as unworthv to look on so great a monarch. When he drew near, Cortes dismounted, advancing to∣wards him with officious haste, and in a respectful posture. At the same time Montezuma alighted from his chair, and leaning on the arms of two of his near relations, approached with a slow and stately pace, his attendants covering the street with cotton cloths, that he might not touch the ground. Cortes accosted him with profound reverence, after the European fashion. He returned the salutation, according to the mode of his country, by touching the earth with his hand, and then kissing it. This

ceremony, the customary expression of veneration from inferiors towards those who were above them in rank, appeared such amazing condescension in a proud monarch, who scarcely deigned to con∣sider the rest of mankind as of the same species with himself, that all his subjects firmly believed those persons, before whom he humbled himself in this manner, to be something more than human. Accordingly, as they marched through the crowd, the Spaniards frequently, and with much satisfac∣tion, heard themselves denominated <HI>Toules,</HI> or di∣vinities. Nothing material passed in this first in∣terview. Montezuma conducted Cortes to the quarters which he had prepared for his reception, and immediately took leave of him, with a polite∣ness not unworthy of a court more refined. "You are now," says he, "with your brothers in your own house; refresh yourselves after your fatigue, and be happy until I return<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes. Relat. Ram. iii. 232—235. B.

It. was surrounded by a stone-wall, with towers at proper distances, which served for defence as well as for ornament, and its apartments and courts were so large, as to accommodate both the Spaniards and their Indian allies. The first care of Cortes was to take pre∣cautions for his security, by planting the artillery so as to command the different avenues which led to it, by appointing a large division of his troops to be always on guard, and by posting centinels at proper stations, with injunctions to observe the same vigilant discipline as if they were within sight of an enemy's camp.</P>

to Cortes and to his officers, but even to the pri∣vate men, as proved the liberality of the monarch to be suitable to the opulence of his kingdom. A long conference ensued, in which Cortes learned what was the opinion of Montezuma with respect to the Spaniards. It was an established tradition, he told him, among the Mexicans, that their an∣cestors came originally from a remote region, and conquered the provinces now subject to his domi∣nion; that after they were settled there, the great captain who conducted this colony returned to his own country, promising, that at some future period his descendants should visit them, assume the go∣vernment, and reform their constitution and laws; that, from what he had heard and seen of Cortes and his followers, he was convinced that they were the very persons whose appearance the Mexican traditions and prophecies taught them to expect; that accordingly he had received them, not as strangers, but as relations of the same blood and parentage, and desired that they might consider themselves as masters in his dominions, for both himself and his subjects should be ready to comply with their will, and even to prevent their wishes. Cortes made a reply in his usual style, with respect to the dignity and power of his sovereign, and his intention in sending him into that country; artfully endeavouring so to frame his discourse, that it might coincide as much as possible with the idea which Montezuma had formed concerning the ori∣gin of the Spaniards. Next morning, Cortes and some of his principal attendants were admitted to a public audience of the emperor. The three sub∣sequent days were employed in viewing the city; the appearance of which, so far superior in the order of its buildings and the number of its inhabitants to any place the Spaniards had beheld in America, and
<PB N="56" REF="034476_0564_0FFDD9E7C2D111C0"/>
yet so little resembling the structure of an European city, filled them with surprise and admiration.</P>
<P>MEXICO, or <HI>Tenuchtitlan,</HI> as it was anciently called by the natives, is situated in a large plain, environed by mountains of such height, that, though within the torrid zone, the temperature of its climate is mild and healthful. All the moisture which descends from the high grounds is collected in several lakes, the two largest of which, of about ninety miles in circuit, communicate with each other. The waters of the one are fresh, those of the other brackish. On the banks of the latter, and on some small islands adjoining to them, the capital of Montezuma's empire was built. The access to the city was by artificial causeways or streets formed of stones and earth, about thirty feet in breadth. As the waters of the lake during the rainy season overflowed the flat country, these causeways were of considerable length. That of Tacuba, on the west, extended a mile and a half; that of Tepeaca<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I am indebted to M. Clavigero for correcting an error of importance in my description of Mexico.

In each of these causeways were openings at proper intervals, through which the waters flowed, and over these beams of timber were laid, which being covered with earth, the causeway or street had every where an uniform appearance. As the approaches to the city were singular, its construction was remarkable.

Not only the temples of their gods, but the houses belonging to the monarch, and to persons of dis∣tinction, were of such dimensions, that,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1518.</NOTE> in com∣parison with any other buildings which had been hitherto discovered in America, they might be termed magnificent.

But they were all placed in a re∣gular manner, on the banks of the canals which passed through the city, in some of its districts, or on the sides of the streets which intersected it in other quarters.

In this city, the pride of the New World, and the noblest monument of the industry and art of man, while unacquainted with the use of iron, and destitute of aid from any domestic animal, the Spaniards, who are most moderate in their compu∣tations, reckon that there were at least sixty thou∣sand inhabitants<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat.

But as soon as he en∣tered Mexico, he became sensible, that, from an excess of confidence in the superior valour and dis∣cipline of his troops, as well as from the disad∣vantage of having nothing to guide him in an un∣known country, but the defective intelligence which he had received from people with whom his mode of communication was very imperfect, he had pushed forward into a situation, where it was diffi∣cult to continue, and from which it was dangerous to retire. Disgrace, and perhaps ruin, was the cer∣tain consequence of attempting the latter. The success of his enterprise depended upon supporting the high opinion which the people of New Spain had formed with respect to the irresistible power of his arms. Upon the first symptom of timidity on his part, their veneration would cease, and Mon∣tezuma, whom fear alone restrained at present, would let loose upon him the whole force of his empire. At the same time, he knew that the countenance of his own sovereign was to be ob∣tained only by a series of victories, and that no∣thing but the merit of extraordinary success could screen his conduct from the censure of irregularity. From all these considerations, it was necessary to maintain his station, and to extricate himself out of the difficulties in which one bold step had involved

him, by venturing upon another still bolder. The situation was trying, but his mind was equal to it; and after revolving the matter with deep attention, he fixed upon a plan no less extraordinary than daring.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Resolves to seize Mon∣tezuma</NOTE> He determined to seize Montezuma in his palace, and to carry him as a prisoner to the Spanish quarters. From the superstitious veneration of the Mexicans for the person of their monarch, as well as their implicit submission to his will, he hoped, by having Montezuma in his power, to ac∣quire the supreme direction of their affairs; or, at least, with such a sacred pledge in his hands, he made no doubt of being secure from any effort of their violence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His man∣ner of exe∣cuting this</NOTE>THIS he immediately proposed to his officers. The timid startled at a measure so audacious, and raised objections. The more intelligent and reso∣lute, conscious that it was the only resource in which there appeared any prospect of safety, warmly approved of it, and brought over their companions so cordially to the same opinion, that it was agreed instantly to make the attempt. At his usual hour of visiting Montezuma, Cortes went to the palace, accompanied by Alvarado, Sandoval, Lugo, Velasquez de Leon, and Davila, five of his principal officers, and as many trusty soldiers. Thirty chosen men followed, not in regular order, but sauntering at some distance, as if they had no object but curiosity; small parties were posted at proper intervals, in all the streets leading from the Spanish quarters to the court; and the remainder of his troops, with the Tlascalan allies, were under arms, ready to sally out on the first alarm. Cortes and his attendants were admitted without suspicion; the Mexicans retiring, as usual, out of respect. He addressed the monarch in a tone very different from that which he had employed in former conferences, reproaching him bitterly as the author of the vio∣lent

assault made upon the Spaniards by one of his officers, and demanded public reparation for the loss which they had sustained by the death of some of their companions, as well as for the insult offered to the great prince whose servants they were. Mon∣tezuma, confounded at this unexpected accusation, and changing colour, either from consciousness of guilt, or from feeling the indignity with which he was treated, asserted his own innocence with great earnestness, and, as a proof of it, gave orders in∣stantly to bring Qualpopoca and his accomplices prisoners to Mexico. Cortes replied, with seeming complaisance, that a declaration so respectable left no doubt remaining in his own mind, but that some∣thing more was requisite to satisfy his followers, who would never be convinced that Montezuma did not harbour hostile intentions against them, unless, as an evidence of his confidence and attach∣ment, he removed from his own palace, and took up his residence in the Spanish quarters, where he should be served and honoured as became a great monarch. The first mention of so strange a pro∣posal bereaved Montezuma of speech, and almost of motion. At length, indignation gave him ut∣terance, and he haughtily answered, "That per∣sons of his rank were not accustomed volutarily to give up themselves as prisoners; and were he mean enough to do so, his subjects would not per∣mit such an affront to be offered to their sovereign." Cortes, unwilling to employ force, endeavoured alternately to sooth and to intimidate him. The altercation became warm; and having continued above three hours, Velasquez de Leon, an impe∣tuous and gallant young man, exclaimed with im∣patience, "Why waste more time in vain? Let us either seize him instantly or stab him to the heart." The threatning voice and fierce gestures with which these words were uttered, struck Monte∣zuma.

But as soon as Montezuma appeared with a seem∣ing gaity of countenance, and waved his hand, the tumult was hushed, and upon his declaring it to be of his own choice that he went to reside for some time among his new friends, the multitude, taught to revere every intimation of their sovereign's plea∣sure, quietly dispersed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B.

They were formally tried by a Spanish court-martial; and though they had acted no other part than what became loyal subjects and brave men, in obeying the orders of their lawful sovereign, and in opposing the inva∣ders of their country, they were condemned to be burnt alive. The execution of such atrocious deeds is seldom long suspended. The unhappy victims were instantly led forth. The pile on which they were laid was composed of the weapons collected in the royal magazine for the public defence. An innumerable multitude of Mexicans beheld, in silent astonishment, the double insult offered to the majesty of their empire, an officer of distinction committed to the flames by the authority of stran∣gers, for having done what he owed in duty to his natural sovereign; and the arms provided by the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">1519.</NOTE>BUT these were not the most shocking indigni∣ties which the Mexicans had to bear. The Spa∣niards, convinced that Qualpopoca would not have ventured to attack Escalante without orders from his master, were not satisfied with inflicting venge∣ance on the instrument employed in committing that crime, while the author of it escaped with im∣punity. Just before Qualpopoca was led but to suffer, Cortes entered the apartment of Monte∣zuma, followed by some of his officers, and a soldier carrying a pair of fetters; and approaching the monarch with a stern countenance, told him, that as the persons who were now to undergo the punish∣ment which they merited, had charged him as the cause of the outrage committed, it was neces∣sary that he likewise should make atonement for that guilt; then turning away abruptly, without waiting for a reply, commanded the soldier to clap the fetters on his legs. The orders were instantly executed. The disconsolate monarch, trained up with an idea that his person was sacred and invio∣lable, and considering this profanation of it as the pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ude of immediate death, broke out into loud lamentations and complaints. His attendants, speechless with horror, fell at his feet, bathing them with their tears; and bearing up the fetters in their hands, endeavoured with officious tenderness to lighten their pressure. Nor did their grief and despondency abate, until Cortes returned from the execution, and with a cheerful countenance ordered the fetters to be taken off. As Montezuma's spirits had sunk with unmanly dejection, they now rose into indecent joy; and with an unbecoming tran∣sition, he passed at once from the anguish of despair to transports of gratitude and expressions of fond∣ness towards his deliverer.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="034476_0573_0FFDD9FFB09E7110"/>IN those transactions, as represented by the Spa∣nish historians, we search in vain for the qualities which distinguish other parts of Cortes's conduct.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons of Cortes's conduct.</NOTE> To usurp a jurisdiction which could not belong to a stranger, who assumed no higher character than that of an ambassador from a foreign prince, and, under colour of it, to inflict a capital punishment on men whose conduct intitled them to esteem, appears an act of barbarous cruelty. To put the monarch of a great kingdom in irons, and, after such ignominious treatment, suddenly to release him, seems to be a display of power no less incon∣siderate than wanton. According to the common relation, no account can be given either of the one action or the other, but that Cortes, intoxicated with success, and presuming on the ascendant which he had acquired over the minds of the Mexi∣cans, thought nothing too bold for him to under∣take, or too dangerous to execute. But, in one view, these proceedings, however repugnant to justice and humanity, may have flowed from that artful policy which regulated every part of Cortes's behaviour towards the Mexicans. They had con∣ceived the Spaniards to be an order of beings supe∣rior to men. It was of the utmost consequence to cherish this illusion, and to keep up the veneration which it inspired. Cortes wished that shedding the blood of a Spaniard should be deemed the most heinous of all crimes; and nothing appeared better calculated to establish this opinion, than to con∣demn the first Mexican who had ventured to com∣mit it to a cruel death, and to oblige their monarch himself to submit to a mortifying indignity, as an expiation for being accessary to a deed so atro∣cious<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="034476_0574_0FFDDA02500A1440"/>THE rigour with which Cortes punished the un∣happy persons who first presumed to lay violent hands upon his followers,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1520. The power which Cor∣tes acquir¦ed.</NOTE> seems accordingly to have made all the impression that he desired. The spirit of Montezuma was not only overawed, but subdued. During six months that Cortes remained in Mexico, the monarch continued in the Spanish quarters, with an appearance of as entire satisfac∣tion and tranquillity, as if he had resided there, not from constraint, but through choice. His mini∣sters and officers attended him as usual. He took cognizance of all affairs; every order was issued in his name. The external aspect of government appearing the same, and all its ancient forms being scrupulously observed, the people were so little sen∣sible of any change, that they obeyed the mandates of their monarch with the same submissive reve∣rence as ever. Such was the dread which both Montezuma and his subjects had of the Spaniards, or such the veneration in which they held them, that no attempt was made to deliver their sovereign from confinement; and though Cortes, relying on this ascendant which he had acquired over their minds, permitted him not only to visit his temples, but to make hunting excursions beyond the lake, a guard of a few Spaniards carried with it such a terror as to intimidate the multitude, and secure the captive monarch <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes. Relat. p. 236. E. B. Diaz. c. 97, 98, 99.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS, by the fortunate temerity of Cortes in seizing Montezuma, the Spaniards at once secured to themselves more extensive authority in the Mexi∣can empire than it was possible to have acquired in a long course of time by open force; and they exercised more absolute sway in the name of an∣other than they could have done in their own. The arts of polished nations, in subjecting such as are
<PB N="67" REF="034476_0575_0FFDDA05298906B0"/>
less improved, have been nearly the same in every period. The system of screening a foreign usurpa∣tion, under the sanction of authority derived from the natural rulers of a country, the device of em∣ploying the magistrates and forms already esta∣blished as instruments to introduce a new dominion, of which we are apt to boast as sublime refinements in policy peculiar to the present age, were inven∣tions of a more early period, and had been tried with success in the West, long before they were practised in the East.</P>
<P>CORTES availed himself to the utmost of the power which he possessed by being able to act in the name of Montezuma. He sent some Spaniards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Vse which he makes of it.</NOTE> whom he judged best qualified for such commissions, into different parts of the empire, accompanied by persons of distinction, whom Montezuma appointed to attend them both as guides and protectors. They visited most of the provinces, viewed their soil and pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uctions, surveyed with particular care the dis∣tricts which yielded gold or silver, pitched upon se∣veral places as proper stations for future colonies, and endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people for submitting to the Spanish yoke. While they were thus employed, Cortes, in the name and by the authority of Montezuma, degraded some of the principal officers in the empire, whose abilities or independent spirit excited his jealousy, and substi∣tuted in their place persons less capable or more ob∣sequious.</P>
<P>ONE thing still was wanting to complete his se∣curity. He wished to have such command of the lake as might ensure a retreat, if, either from le∣vity or disgust, the Mexicans should take arms against him, and break down the bridges or cause∣ways. This too, his own address, and the faci∣lity of Montezuma, enabled him to accomplish. Having frequently entertained his prisoner with

pompous accounts of the European marine and ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of navigation, he awakened his curiosity to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> those moving palaces which moved their way through the water without oars. Under pretext of gratifying this desire, Cortes persuaded Mon∣tezuma to appoint some of his subjects to fetch part of the naval stores which the Spaniards had depo∣sited at Vera Cruz to Mexico, and to employ others in cutting down and preparing timber. With their assistance, the Spanish carpenters soon completed two brigantines, which afforded a frivolous amuse∣ment to the monarch, and were considered by Cortes as a certain resource, if he should be obliged to retire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Montezu∣ma ac∣knowledges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a vassal of Spain.</NOTE>ENCOURAGED by so many instances of the mo∣narch's tame submission to his will, Cortes ventured to put it to a proof still more trying. He urged Montezuma to acknowledge himself a vassal of the king of Castile, to hold his crown of him as supe∣rior, aan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to subject his dominions to the payment of an annual tribute. With this requisition, the last and most humbling that can be made to one possessed of sovereign authority, Montezuma was so obsequious as to comply. He called together the chief men of his empire, and in a solemn harangue, reminded them of the traditions and prophe∣cies which led them to expect the arrival of a people sprung from the same stock with themselves, in order to take possession of the supreme power, he declared his belief that the Spaniards were this promised race; that therefore he recognized the right of their monarch to govern the Mexican empire; that he would lay his crown at his feet, and obey him as a tributary. While uttering these words, Montezuma discovered how deeply he was afflicted in making such a sacrifice. Tears and groans frequently interrupted his discourse. Over∣awed and broken as his spirit was, it still retained
<PB N="69" REF="034476_0577_0FFDDA0953FC2A48"/>
such a sense of dignity, as to feel that pang which pierces the heart of princes when constrained to resign independent power. The first mention of such a resolution struck the assembly dumb with astonishment. This was followed by a sullen mur∣mur of sorrow, mingled with indignation, which indicated some violent eruption of rage to be near at hand. This Cortes foresaw, and seasonably in∣terposed to prevent it, by declaring that his master had no intention to deprive Montezuma of the royal dignity, or to make any innovation upon the constitution and laws of the Mexican empire. This assurance, added to their dread of the Spanish power, and to the authority of their monarch's ex∣ample, extorted a reluctant consent from the assem∣bly<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XVI.</NOTE>. The act of submission and homage was exe∣cuted with all the formalities which the Spaniards were pleased to prescribe<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 238. D. B. Diaz, c. 101.

<P>MONTEZUMA, at the desire of Cortes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The a∣mount of the treasure collected by the Spani∣ards.</NOTE> accom∣panied this profession of sealty and homage with a magnificent present to his new sovereign; and, af∣ter his example, his subjects brought in very libe∣ral contributions. The Spaniards now collected all the treasure which had been either voluntarily bestowed upon them at different times by Monte∣zuma, or had been extorted from his people under various pretexts; and having melted the gold and silver, the value of these, without including jewels and ornaments of various kinds, which were pre∣served on account of their curious workmanship, amounted to six hundred thousand <HI>pesos.</HI> The sol∣diers were impatient to have it divided,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Division of it, and the discontent it occasion∣ed.</NOTE> and Cortes complied with their desire. A fifth of the whole was first set apart as the tax due to the king. Ano∣ther
<PB N="70" REF="034476_0578_0FFDDA0CFAB78650"/>
fifth was allotted to Cortes, as commander in chief. The sums advanced by Velasquez, by Cortes, and by some of the officers, towards de∣fraying the expence of fitting out the armament, were then deducted. The remainder was divided among the army, including the garrison of Vera Cruz, in proportion to their different ranks. After so many defalcations, the share of a private man did not exceed a hundred pesos. This sum fell so far below their sanguine expectations, that some soldiers rejected it with scorn, and others murmured so lonely at this cruel disappointment of their hopes, that it required all the address of Cortes, and no small exertion of his liberality, to appease them. The complaints of the army were not altogether destitute of foundation. As the crown had contri∣buted nothing towards the equipment or success of the armament, it was not without regret that the soldiers beheld it sweep away so great a proportion of the treasure purchased by their blood and toil. What fell to the share of the general appeared, ac∣cording to the ideas of wealth in the sixteenth century, an enormous sum. Some of Cortes's fa∣vourites had secretly appropriated to their own use several ornaments of gold, which neither paid the royal fifth, nor were brought into account as part of the common stock. It was, however, so mani∣festly the interest of Cortes at this period to make a large remittance to the king, that it is highly probable those concealments were not of great con∣sequence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Reasons why gold was found in such small quan∣tities.</NOTE>THE total sum amassed by the Spaniards bears no proportion to the ideas which might be formed, either by reflecting on the descriptions given by historians of the ancient splendour of Mexico, or by considering the productions of its mines in mo∣dern times. But, among the ancient Mexicans, gold and silver were not the standards by which the
<PB N="71" REF="034476_0579_0FFDDA0F70DD1FF0"/>
worth of other commodities was estimated; and destitute of the artificial value derived from this circumstance, were no farther in request than as they furnished materials for ornaments and trinkets. These were either consecrated to the gods in their temples, or were worn as marks of distinction by their princes and some of their most eminent chiefs. As the consumption of the precious metals was inconsiderable, the demand for them was not such as to put either the ingenuity or industry of the Mexicans on the stretch, in order to augment their store. They were altogether unacquainted with the art of working the rich mines with which their country abounded. What gold they had was ga∣thered in the beds of rivers, native, and ripened into a pure metallic state <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. p. 236. F. B. Diaz. c. 102, 103. Gomara Cron. c. 90.</NOTE>. The utmost effort of their labour in search of it was to wash the earth carried down by torrents from the mountains, and to pick out the grains of gold which subsided; and even this simple operation, according to the report of the persons whom Cortes appointed to survey the provinces where there was a prospect of finding mines, they performed very unskilfully<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">B. Diaz. c. 103.</NOTE>. From all those causes, the whole mass of gold in posses∣sion of the Mexicans was not great. As silver is rarely found pure, and the Mexican art was too rude to conduct the process for refining it in a pro∣per manner, the quantity of this metal was still less considerable<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ix. c. 4.</NOTE>. Thus, though the Spaniards had exerted all the power which they possessed in Mexico, and often with indecent rapacity, in order to gratify their predominant passion; and though Montezuma had fondly exhausted his treasures, in hopes of satiating their thirst for gold, the product of both, which probably included a great part of
<PB N="72" REF="034476_0580_0FFDDA1336641280"/>
the bullion in the empire, did not rise in value above what has been mentioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT however pliant Montezuma might be in other matters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Montezu∣ma inflexi∣ble with re∣spect to re∣ligion.</NOTE> with respect to one point he was in∣flexible. Though Cortes often urged him, with the importunate zeal of a missionary, to renounce his false gods, and to embrace the Christian faith, he always rejected the proposition with horror. Superstition, among the Mexicans, was formed into such a regular and complete system, that its institutions naturally took fast hold of the mind; and while the rude tribes in other parts of America were easily induced to relinquish a few notions and rites, so loose and arbitrary as hardly to merit the name of a public religion, the Mexicans adhered tenaciously to their mode of worship, which, how∣ever barbarous, was accompanied with such order and solemnity as to render it an object of the highest veneration. Cortes, finding all his attempts inef∣fectual to shake the constancy of Montezuma, was so much enraged at his obstinacy, that in a transport of zeal he led out his soldiers to throw down the idols in the great temple by for<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ But the priests taking arms in defence of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tars, and the people crowding with great ardour to support them, Cortes's prudence overruled his zeal, and induced him to desist from his rash attempt, after dislodging the idols from one of the shrines, and placing in their stead an image of the Virgin Mary<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XVIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Schemes of the Mexi∣cans to de∣stroy the Spaniards.</NOTE>FROM that moment the Mexicans, who had permitted the imprisonment of their sovereign, and suffered the exactions of strangers without a strug∣gle, began to meditate how they might expel or destroy the Spaniards, and thought themselves called upon to avenge their insulted deities. The priests and leading men held frequent consultations
<PB N="73" REF="034476_0581_0FFDDA15D6A35D48"/>
with Montezuma for this purpose. But as it might prove fatal to the captive monarch to attempt either the one or the other by violence, he was willing to try more gentle means. Having called Cortes into his presence, he observed, that now, as all the purposes of his embassy were fully ac∣complished, the gods had declared their will, and the people signified their desire that he and his followers should instantly depart out of the empire. With this he required them to comply, or una∣voidable destruction would fall suddenly on their heads. The tenor of this unexpected requisition, as well as the determined tone in which it was uttered, left Cortes no room to doubt that it was the result of some deep scheme concerted between Montezuma and his subjects. He quickly perceived that he might derive more advantage from a seeming com∣pliance with the monarch's inclination, than from an ill-timed attempt to change or to oppose it; and re∣plied, with great composure, that he had already be∣gun to prepare for returning to his own country; but as he had destroyed the vessels in which he arrived, some time was requisite for building other ships. This appeared seasonable. A number of Mexicans were sent to Vera Cruz to cut down timber, and some Spanish carpenters were appointed to super∣intend the work. Cortes flattered himself, that during this interval he might either find means to avert the threatened danger, or receive such rein∣forcements as would enable him to despise it.</P>
<P>ALMOST nine months were elapsed since Porto∣carrero and Montejo had sailed with his dispatches to Spain;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Anxiety and danger of Cortes.</NOTE> and he daily expected their return with a confirmation of his authority from the king.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The arrival of a new armament,</NOTE>WHILE he remained in this cruel situation, anxi∣ous about what was past, uncertain with respect to the future, and, by the late declaration of Monte∣zuma, oppressed with a new addition of cares, a Mexican courier arrived with an account of some ships having appeared on the coast.

Their joy was not of long continuance.

From the circum∣stances of Cortes's departure, it was impossible not to suspect his intention of throwing off all depend∣ence upon him. His neglecting to transmit any account of his operations to Cuba, strengthened this suspicion, which was at last confirmed beyond doubt, by the indiscretion of the officers whom Cortes sent to Spain.

By this means Valasquez not only learned that Cortes and his followers, after formally renouncing all connection with him, had established an independ∣ent colony in New Spain, and were soliciting the king to confirm their proceedings by his authority; but he obtained particular information concerning the opulence of the country, the valuable presents which Cortes had received, and the inviting prospects of success that opened to his view. Every passion which can agitate an ambitious mind; shame, at having been so grossly overreached; indignation, at being betrayed by the man whom he had selected as the object of his favour and confidence; grief, for hav∣ing wasted his fortune to aggrandize an enemy; and despair of recovering so fair an opportunity of establishing his fame and extending his power, now raged in the bosom of Velasquez. All these, with united force, excited him to make an extraordinary effort in order to be avenged on the author of his wrongs, and to wrest from him his usurped autho∣rity and conquests. Nor did he want the appear∣ance of a good title to justify such an attempt. The agent whom he sent to Spain with an account of Grijalva's voyage, had met with a most favour∣able reception; and from the specimens which he produced, such high expectations were formed concerning the opulence of New Spain, that Velas∣quez was authorised to prosecute the discovery of the country, and appointed governor of it during life, with more extensive power and privileges than had been granted to any adventurer from the time of Columbus<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. iii. c. 11.</NOTE>.

As Velasquez's experience of the fatal con∣sequence of committing to another what he ought to have executed himself, had not rendered him more enterprising, he vested the command of this formidable body, which, in the infancy of the Spa∣nish power in America, merits the appellation of an army, in Pamphilo de Narvaez, with instruc∣tions to seize Cortes and his principal officers, to send them prisoners to him, and then to complete the discovery and conquest of the country in his name.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg"><P>The pro∣ceedings of Narvaez.</P>
<P>April.</P></NOTE>AFTER a prosperous voyage, Narvaez landed his men without opposition near St. Juan de Ullua. Three soldiers, whom Cortes had sent to search for mines in that district, immediately joined him. By this accident, he not only received information concerning the progress and situation of Cortes, but as these soldiers had made some progress in the knowledge of the Mexican language, he acquired interpreters, by whose means he was enabled to hold some intercourse with the people of the coun∣try. But, according to the low cunning of desert∣ers, they framed their intelligence with more at∣tention to what they thought would be agreeable, than to what they knew to be true; and represented
<PB N="77" REF="034476_0585_0FFDDA204D0173D8"/>
the situation of Cortes to be so desperate, and the disaffection of his followers to be so general, as in∣creased the natural confidence and presumption of Narvaez. His first operation, however, might have taught him not to rely on their partial ac∣counts. Having sent to summon the governor of Vera Cruz to surrender, Guevara, a priest whom he employed in that service, made the requisition with such insolence, that Sandoval, an officer of high spirit, and zealously attached to Cortes, instead of complying with his demands, seized him and his attendants, and sent them in chains to Mexico.</P>
<P>CORTES received them not like enemies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cortes deeply alarmed.</NOTE> but as friends, and condemning the severity of Sandoval, set them immediately at liberty. By this well-timed clemency, seconded by caresses and presents, he gained their confidence, and drew from them such particulars concerning the force and intentions of Narvaez, as gave him a view of the impending danger in its full extent. He had not to contend now with half-naked Indians, no match for him in war, and still more inferior in the arts of policy, but to take the field against an army in courage and martial discipline equal to his own, in number far superior, acting under the sanction of royal autho∣rity, and commanded by an officer of known bra∣very. He was informed that Narvaez, more soli∣citous to gratify the resentment of Velasquez, than attentive to the honour or interest of his country, had begun his intercourse with the natives, by re∣presenting him and his followers as fugitives and outlaws, guilty of rebellion against their own sove∣reign, and of injustice in invading the Mexican empire; and had declared that his chief object in visiting the country was to punish the Spaniards who had committed these crimes, and to rescue the Mexicans from oppression. He soon perceived
<PB N="78" REF="034476_0586_0FFDDA22E7E3E618"/>
that the same unfavourable representations of his character and actions had been conveyed to Mon∣tezuma, and that Narvaez had found means to as∣sure him, that as the conduct of those who kept him under restraint was highly displeasing to the king his master, he had it in charge not only to rescue an injured monarch from confinement, but to reinstate him in the possession of his ancient power and independence. Animated with this pros∣pect of being set free from subjection to strangers, the Mexicans in several provinces began openly to revolt from Cortes, and to regard Narvaez as a deliverer no less able than willing to save them. Montezuma himself kept up a secret intercouse with the new commander, and seemed to court him as a person superior in power and dignity to those Spaniards whom he had hitherto revered as the first of men<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XX.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His delibe∣rations con∣cerning his own con∣duct.</NOTE>SUCH were the various aspects of danger and difficulty which presented themselves to the view of Cortes. No situation can be conceived more trying to the capacity and firmness of a general, or where the choice of the plan which ought to be adopted was more difficult. If he should wait the approach of Narvaez in Mexico, destruction seemed to be unavoidable; for while the Spaniards pressed him from without, the inhabitants, whose turbulent spirit he could hardly restrain with all his authority and attention would eagerly lay hold on such a favourable opportunity of avenging all their wrongs. If he should abandon the capital, set the captive monarch at liberty, and march out to meet the enemy; he must at once forego the fruits of all his toils and victories, and relinquish advan∣tages which could not be recovered without ex∣traordinary efforts, and infinite danger. If, in∣stead
<PB N="79" REF="034476_0587_0FFDDA24A3B87478"/>
of employing force, he should have recourse to conciliating measures, and attempt an accom∣modation with Narvaez; the natural haughtiness of that officer, augmented by consciousness of his present superiority, forbad him to cherish any san∣guine hope of success. After revolving every scheme with deep attention, Cortes fixed upon that which in execution was most hazardous, but if successful, would prove most beneficial to him∣self and his country; and with the decisive in∣trepidity suited to desperate situations, determined to make one bold effort for victory under every disadvantage, rather than sacrifice his own con∣quests and the Spanish interest in Mexico.</P>
<P>BUT though he foresaw that the contest must be terminated finally by arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His negoci∣ations with the follow∣ers of Nar∣vaez.</NOTE> it would have been not only indecent, but criminal, to have marched against his countrymen, without attempting to ad∣just matters by an amicable negociation. In this service he employed Olmedo, his chaplain, to whose character the function was well suited, and who possessed, besides, such prudence and address as qualified him to carry on the secret intrigues in which Cortes placed his chief confidence. Narvaez rejected, with scorn, every scheme of accommo∣dation that Olmedo proposed, and was with diffi∣culty restrained from laying violent hands on him and his attendants. He met, however, with a more favorable reception among the followers of Narvaez, to many of whom he delivered letters, either from Cortes or his officers, their ancient friends and companions. Cortes artfully accom∣panied these with presents of rings, chains of gold, and other trinkets of value, which inspired those needy adventurers with high ideas of the wealth that he had acquired, and with envy of their good fortune who were engaged in his service. Some, from hopes of becoming sharers in those rich spoils,
<PB N="80" REF="034476_0588_0FFDDA274695DE08"/>
declared for an immediate accommodation with Cortes. Others, from public spirit, laboured to prevent a civil war, which, whatever party should prevail, must shake, and perhaps subvert the Spa∣nish power, in a country where it was so imper∣fectly established. Narvaez disregarded both, and by a public proclamation denounced Cortes and his adherents rebels and enemies to their country. Cortes, it is probable, was not much surprised at the untractable arrogance of Narvaez; and, after having given such a proof of his own pacific dis∣position as might justify his recourse to other means, he determined to advance towards an enemy whom he had laboured in vain to appease.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Marches against him. May.</NOTE>HE left a hundred and fifty men in the capital, under the command of Pedro de Alvarado, an offi∣cer of distinguished courage, for whom the Mexi∣cans had conceived a singular degree of respect. To the custody of this slender garrison he committed a great city, with all the wealth he had amassed, and, what was still of greater importance, the person of the imprisoned monarch. His utmost art was em∣ployed in concealing from Montezuma the real cause of his march. He laboured to persuade him, that the strangers who had lately arrived were his friends and fellow-subjects; and that, after a short interview with them, they would depart together, and return to their own country. The captive prince, unable to comprehend the designs of the Spaniards, or to reconcile what he now heard with the declarations of Narvaez, and afraid to discover any symptom of suspicion or distrust of Cortes, promised to remain quietly in the Spanish quarters, and to cultivate the same friendship with Alvarado which he had uniformly maintained with him. Cortes, with seeming confidence in this promise, but relying principally upon the injunctions which he had given Alvarado to guard his prisoner

with the most scrupulous vigilance, set out from Mexico.</P>
<P>HIS strength, even after it was reinforced by the junction of Sandoval and the garrison of Vera Cruz, did not exceed two hundred and fifty men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of his troops.</NOTE> As he hoped for success chiefly from the rapidity of his motions, his troops were not incumbered either with baggage or artillery. But as he dreaded extremely the impression which the enemy might make with their cavalry, he had provided against this danger with the foresight and sagacity which distinguish a great commander. Having observed that the Indians in the province of Chinantla used spears of extraordinary length and force, he arm∣ed his soldiers with these, and accustomed them to that deep and compact arrangement which the use of this formidable weapon, the best perhaps that ever was invented for defence, enabled them to assume.</P>
<P>WITH this small but firm battalion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Continues to negociate as he ad∣vanced.</NOTE> Cortes ad∣vanced towards Zempoalla, of which Narvaez had taken possession. During his march, he made re∣peated attempts towards some accommodation with his opponent. But Narvaez requiring that Cortes and his followers should instantly recognize his title to be governor of New Spain, in virtue of the powers which he derived from Velasquez; and Cortes refusing to submit to any authority which was not founded on a commission from the emperor himself, under whose immediate protection he and his adherents had placed their infant colony; all these attempts proved fruitless. The intercourse, however, which this occasioned between the two parties, proved of no small advantage to Cortes, as it afforded him an opportunity of gaining some of Narvaez's officers by liberal presents, of soften∣ing others by a semblance of moderation, and of dazzling all by the appearance of wealth among his
<PB N="82" REF="034476_0590_0FFDDA2D8280CAF8"/>
troops, most of his soldiers having converted their share of the Mexican gold into chains, bracelets, and other ornaments, which they displayed with military ostentation. Narvaez and a little junto of his creatures excepted, all the army leaned towards an accommodation with their countrymen. This discovery of their inclination irritated his violent temper almost to madness. In a transport of rage, he set a price on the head of Cortes, and of his principal officers; and having learned that he was now advanced within a league of Zempoalla with his small body of men, he considered this as an insult which merited immediate chastisement, and marched out with all his troops to offer him battle.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attacks Narvaez in the night.</NOTE>BUT Cortes was a leader of greater abilities and experience than, on equal ground, to fight an enemy so far superior in number, and so much better appointed. Having taken his station on the opposite bank of the river de Canoas, where he knew that he could not be attacked, be beheld the approach of the enemy without concern, and dis∣regarded this vain bravade. It was then the begin∣ning of the wet season<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hackluyt, vol. iii. 467. De Laet. Descr. Ind. Occid. 221.</NOTE>, and the rain had poured down, during a great part of the day, with the violence peculiar to the torrid zone. The follow∣ers of Narvaez, unaccustomed to the hardships of military service, murmured so much at being thus fruitlessly exposed, that, from their unsoldier-like impatience, as well as his own contempt of his adversary, their general permitted them to retire to Zempoalla. The very circumstance which induced them to quit the field, encouraged Cortes to form a scheme, by which he hoped at once to terminate the war. He observed, that his hardy veterans, though standing under the torrents which conti∣nued
<PB N="83" REF="034476_0591_0FFDDA2F65A45270"/>
to fall, without a single tent or any shelter whatsoever to cover them, were so far from re∣pining at hardships which were become familiar to them, that they were still fresh and alert for ser∣vice. He foresaw that the enemy would naturally give themselves up to repose after their fatigue, and that, judging of the conduct of others by their own effeminacy, they would deem themselves per∣fectly secure at a season so unfit for action. He resolved, therefore, to fall upon them in the dead of night, when the surprise and terror of this un∣expected attack might more than compensate the inferiority of his numbers. His soldiers, sensible that no resource remained but in some desperate ef∣fort of courage, approved of the measure with such warmth, that Cortes, in a military oration which he addressed to them before they began their march, was more solicitous to temper than to in∣flame their ardour. He divided them into three parties. At the head of the first he placed Sando∣val; entrusting this gallant officer with the most dangerous and important service, that of seizing the enemy's artillery, which was planted before the principal tower of the temple, where Narvaez had fixed his head-quarters. Christoval de Olid commanded the second, with orders to assault the tower, and lay hold on the general. Cortes him∣self conducted the third and smallest division, which was to act as a body of reserve, and to sup∣port the other two as there should be occasion. Having passed the river de Canoas, which was much swelled with the rains, not without difficulty, the water reaching almost to their chins, they ad∣vanced in profound silence, without beat of drum, or sound of any warlike instrument; each man armed with his sword, his dagger, and his Chinant∣lan spear. Narvaez, remiss in proportion to his se∣curity, had posted only two centinels to watch the
<PB N="84" REF="034476_0592_0FFDDA34126C7228"/>
motions of an enemy whom he had such good cause to dread. One of these was seized by the advanced guard of Cortes's troops, the other made his escape, and hurrying to the town with all the precipitation of fear and zeal, gave such timely notice of the enemy's approach, that there was full leisure to have prepared for their reception. But, through the arrogance and infatuation of Narvaez, this important interval was lost. He imputed this alarm to the cowardice of the centinel, and treated with derision the idea of being attacked by forces so unequal to his own. The shouts of Cortes's soldiers, rushing on to the assault, convinced him at last, that the danger which he despised was real. The rapidity with which they advanced was such, that only one cannon could be fired, before Sando∣val's party closed with the enemy, drove them from their guns, and began to force their way up the steps of the tower. Narvaez, no less brave in action than presumptuous in conduct, armed him∣self in haste, and by his voice and example ani∣mated his men to the combat. Olid advanced to sustain his companions; and Cortes himself, rushing to the front, conducted and added new vigour to the attack. The compact order in which this small body pressed on, and the impenetrable front which they presented with their long spears, bore down all opposition before it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and over∣comes him.</NOTE> They had now reached the gate, and were struggling to burst it open, when a soldier having set fire to the reeds with which the tower was covered, compelled Nar∣vaez to sally out. In the first encounter he was wounded in the eye with a spear, and falling to the ground, was dragged down the steps, and in a mo∣ment clapt in fetters. The cry of victory resound∣ed among the troops of Cortes. Those who had sallied out with their leader now maintained the conflict feebly, and began to surrender. Among
<PB N="85" REF="034476_0593_0FFDDA35A0A0D438"/>
the remainder of his soldiers, stationed in two smaller towers of the temple, terror and confusion prevailed. The darkness was so great, that they could not distinguish between their friends and foes. Their own artillery was pointed against them. Wherever they turned their eyes, they beheld lights gleaming through the obscurity of night, which, though proceeding only from a variety of shining insects, that abound in moist and sultry climates, their affrighted imaginations represented as nume∣rous bands of musketeers advancing with kindled matches to the attack. After a short resistance, the soldiers compelled their officers to capitulate, and before morning all laid down their arms, and submitted quietly to their conquerors.</P>
<P>THIS complete victory proved more acceptable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The effects of this victory.</NOTE> as it was gained almost without bloodshed, only two soldiers being killed on the side of Cortes, and two officers, with fifteen private men, of the ad∣verse faction. Cortes treated the vanquished not like enemies, but as countrymen and friends, and offered either to send them back directly to Cuba, or to take them into his service, as partners in his fortune, on equal terms with his own soldiers. This latter proposition, seconded by a seasonable distribution of some presents from Cortes, and li∣beral promises of more, opened prospects so agree∣able to the romantic expectations which had invited them to engage in this service, that all, a few par∣tizans of Narvaez excepted, closed with it, and vied with each other in professions of fidelity and attachment to a general, whose recent success had given them such a striking proof of his abilities for command. Thus by a series of events no less fortunate than uncommon, Cortes not only escaped from perdition which seemed inevitable, but, when he had least reason to expect it, was placed at the head of a thousand Spaniards, ready to follow
<PB N="86" REF="034476_0594_0FFDDA3873D65ED8"/>
wherever he should lead them. Whoever reflects upon the facility with which this victory was ob∣tained, or considers with what sudden and unani∣mous transition the followers of Narvaez ranged themselves under the standard of his rival, will be apt to ascribe both events as much to the intrigues as to the arms of Cortes, and cannot but suspect that the ruin of Narvaez was occasioned, no less by the treachery of his own followers, than by the valour of his enemy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 242.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Mexi∣cans take arms against the Spa∣niards.</NOTE>BUT, in one point, the prudent conduct and good fortune of Cortes were equally conspicuous. If, by the rapidity of his operations after he began his march, he had not brought matters to such a speedy issue, even this decisive victory would have come too late to have saved his companions whom he left in Mexico. A few days after the discomfi∣ture of Narvaez, a courier arrived with an account that the Mexicans had taken arms, and having seized and destroyed the two brigantines, which Cortes had built in order to secure the command of the lake, and attacked the Spaniards in their quar∣ters, had killed several of them, and wounded more, had reduced to ashes their magazine of pro∣visions, and carried on hostilities with such fury, that, though Alvarado and his men defended themselves with undaunted resolution, they must either be soon cut off by famine, or sink under the multitude of their enemies. This revolt was excited by motives which rendered it still more alarming. On the departure of Cortes for Zempoalla, the Mexicans flattered themselves, that the long-expected oppor∣tunity of restoring their sovereign to liberty, and of vindicating their country from the odious domi∣nion of strangers, was at length arrived; that while
<PB N="87" REF="034476_0595_0FFDDA3B4ED7D1E8"/>
the forces of their oppressors were divided, and the arms of one party turned against the other, they might triumph with greater facility over both. Consultations were held, and schemes formed with this intention. The Spaniards in Mexico, conscious of their own feebleness, suspected and dreaded those machinations. Alvarado, though a gallant officer, possessed neither that extent of capacity, nor dignity of manners, by which Cortes had ac∣quired such an ascendant over the minds of the Mexicans, as never allowed them to form a just estimate of his weakness or of their own strength. Alvarado knew no mode of supporting his au∣thority but force. Instead of employing address to disconcert the plans or to sooth the spirits of the Mexicans, he waited the return of one of their solemn festivals, when the principal persons in the empire were dancing, according to custom, in the court of the great temple; he seized all the avenues which led to it, and, allured partly by the rich or∣naments which they wore in honour of their gods, and partly by the facility of cutting off at once the authors of that conspiracy which he dreaded, he fell upon them, unarmed and unsuspicious of any danger, and massacred a great number, none escap∣ing but such as made their way over the battlements of the temple. An action so cruel and treacherous filled not only the city, but the whole empire, with indignation and rage. All called aloud for ven∣geance; and regardless of the safety of their mo∣narch, whose life was at the mercy of the Spaniards, or of their own danger in assaulting an enemy who had been so long the object of their terror, they committed all those acts of violence of which Cortes received an account.</P>
<P>TO him the danger appeared so imminent,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He marches back to the capital.</NOTE> as to admit neither of deliberation nor delay. He set out instantly with all his forces, and returned from
<PB N="88" REF="034476_0596_0FFDDA3CE3E7F0B8"/>
Zempoalla with no less rapidity than he had ad∣vanced thither. At Tlascala he was joined by two thousand chosen warriors. On entering the Mexi∣can territories he found that disaffection to the Spaniards was not confined to the capital. The principal inhabitants had deserted the towns through which he passed; no person of note appearing to meet him with the usual respect; no provision was made for the subsistence of his troops; and though he was permitted to advance without opposition, the solitude and silence which reigned in every place, and the horror with which the people avoid∣ed all intercourse with him, discovered a deep-rooted antipathy, that excited the most just alarm. But, implacable as the enmity of the Mexicans was, they were so unacquainted with the science of war, that they knew not how to take the proper measures, either for their own safety or the destruc∣tion of the Spaniards. Uninstructed by their for∣mer error in admitting a formidable enemy into their capital, instead of breaking down the cause-ways and bridges, by which they might have in∣closed Alvarado and his party, and have effectually stopt the career <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cortes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 24.</NOTE> they again suffered him to march into the city without molestation, and to take quiet possession of his ancient station.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Improper conduct of Cortes.</NOTE>THE transports of joy with which Alvarado and his soldiers received their companions cannot be expressed. Both parties were so much elated, the one with their seasonable deliverance, and the other with the great exploits which they had atchieved, that this intoxication of success seems to have reached Cortes himself; and he behaved on this occasion neither with his usual sagacity nor atten∣tion. He not only neglected to visit Montezuma, but imbittered the insult by expressions full of con∣tempt for that unfortunate prince and his people. The forces of which he had now the command,
<PB N="89" REF="034476_0597_0FFDDA408C9A16E8"/>
appeared to him so irresistible, that he might assume an higher tone, and lay aside the mask of moderation, under which he had hitherto concealed his designs. Some Mexicans who understood the Spanish lan∣guage, heard the contemptuous words which Cor∣tes uttered, and reporting them to their country∣men, kindled their rage anew. They were now convinced that the intentions of the general were equally bloody with those of Alvarado, and that his original purpose in visiting their country, had not been, as he pretended, to court the alliance of their sovereign, but to attempt the conquest of his dominions. They resumed their arms with the additional fury which this discovery in∣spired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The violent hostility of the Mexi∣cans.</NOTE> attacked a considerable body of Spaniards who were marching towards the great square in which the public market was held, and compelled them to retire with some loss. Emboldened by this success, and delighted to find that their op∣pressors were not invincible, they advanced next day with extraordinary martial pomp to assault the Spaniards in their quarters. Their number was formidable, and their undaunted courage still more so. Though the artillery pointed against their nu∣merous battalions, crowded together in narrow streets, swept off multitudes at every discharge; though every blow of the Spanish weapons fell with mortal effect upon their naked bodies, the impetuosity of the assault did not abate. Fresh men rushed forward to occupy the places of the slain, and meeting with the same fate, were suc∣ceeded by others no less intrepid and eager for vengeance. The utmost effort of Cortes's abilities and experience, seconded by the disciplined valour or his troops, were hardly sufficient to defend the fortifications, that surrounded the post where the Spaniards were stationed, into which the enemy were more than once on the point of forcing their way.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="034476_0598_0FFDDA434AB82018"/>CORTES beheld, with wonder, the implacable ferocity of a people who seemed at first to submit tamely to the yoke, and had continued so long passive under it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distress of the Spa∣niards.</NOTE> The soldiers of Narvaez, who fondly imagined that they followed Cortes to share in the spoils of a conquered empire, were asto∣nished to find that they were involved in a dan∣gerous war, with an enemy whose vigour was still unbroken, and loudly execrated their own weakness, in giving such easy credit to the delusive promises of their new leader<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B.

As soon as the ap∣proach of evening induced the Mexicans to re∣tire, in compliance with their national custom of ceasing from hostilities with the setting sun, Cortes began to prepare for a sally, next day, with such a considerable force, as might either drive the enemy out of the city, or compel them to listen to terms of accommodation.</P>

Every invention known in the European art of war, as well as every pre∣caution, suggested by his long acquaintance with the Indian mode of fighting, were employed to ensure success. But he found an enemy prepared and determined to oppose him. The force of the Mexicans was greatly augmented by fresh troops, which poured in continually from the country, and their animosity was in no degree abated. They were led by their nobles, inflamed by the exhorta∣tions of their priests, and fought in defence of their temples and families, under the eye of their gods, and in presence of their wives and children. Notwithstanding their numbers, and enthusiastic
<PB N="91" REF="034476_0599_0FFDDA4518CCFBD8"/>
contempt of danger and death, wherever the Spa∣niards could close with them, the superiority of their discipline and arms obliged the Mexicans to give way. But in narrow streets, and where many of the bridges of communication were broken down, the Spaniards could seldom come to a fair rencounter with the enemy, and as they advanced, were exposed to showers of arrows and stones from, the tops of houses. After a day of incessant exer∣tion, though vast numbers of the Mexicans fell, and part of the city was burnt, the Spaniards, weary with the slaughter, and harrassed by multi∣tudes which successively relieved each other, were obliged at length to retire, with the mortification of having accomplished nothing so decisive as to compensate the unusual calamity of having twelve soldiers killed, and above sixty wounded. Another sally, made with greater force, was not more effec∣tual, and in it the general himself was wounded in the hand.</P>
<P>CORTES now perceived, too late,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Montezu∣ma slain.</NOTE> the fatal er∣ror into which he had been betrayed by his own contempt of the Mexicans, and was satisfied that he could neither maintain his present station in the centre of an hostile city <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or retire from it without the most imminent danger. One resource still re∣mained, to try what effect the interposition of Montezuma might have to soothe or overawe his subjects.

whom they had long been accustomed to honour, and almost to revere as a god, the weapons dropt from their hands, every tongue was silent, all bowed their heads, and many prostrated themselves on the ground. Montezuma addressed them with every argument that could mitigate their rage, or persuade them to cease from hostilities. When he ended his discourse, a suller murmur of disappro∣bation run through the ranks; to this succeeded reproaches and threats; and the fury of the multi∣tude rising in a moment above every restraint of decency or respect, flights of arrows and volleys of stones poured in so violently upon the ramparts, that before the Spanish soldiers, appointed to cover Montezuma with their bucklers, had time to lift them in his defence, two arrows wounded the un∣happy monarch, and the blow of a stone on his temple struck him to the ground. On seeing him fall, the Mexicans were so much astonished, that, with a transition not uncommon in popular tu∣mults, they passed in a moment from one extreme to the other, remorse succeeded to insult, and they fled with horror, as if the vengeance of Heaven were pursuing the crime which they had com∣mitted. The Spaniards, without molestation, car∣ried Montezuma to his apartments, and Cortes hastened thither to console him under his misfor∣tune. But the unhappy monarch now perceived how low he was sunk, and the haughty spirit which seemed to have been so long extinct, returning, he scorned to survive this last humiliation, and to protract an ignominious life, not only as the pri∣soner and tool of his enemies, but as the object of contempt or detestation among his subjects. In a transport of rage he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore the bandages from his wounds, and refused, with such obstinacy, to take any nourishment, that he soon ended his wretched

days, rejecting with disdain all the solicitations of the Spaniards to embrace the Christian faith.</P>
<P>UPON the death of Montezuma, Cortes having lost all hope of bringing the Mexicans to an ac∣commodation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New con∣flicts.</NOTE> saw no prospect of safety but in at tempting a retreat, and began to prepare for it. But a sudden motion of the Mexicans engaged him in new conflicts. They took possession of a high tower in the great temple which overlooked the Spanish quarters, and placing there a garrison of their principal warriors, not a Spaniard could stir without being exposed to their missile weapons. From this post it was necessary to dislodge them at any risk; and Juan de Escobar, with a nume∣rous detachment of chosen soldiers, was ordered to make the attack. But Escobar, though a gallant officer, and at the head of troops accustomed to conquer, and who now fought under the eyes of their countrymen, was thrice repulsed. Cortes, sensible that not only the reputation, but the safety of his army depended on the success of this assault, ordered a buckler to be tied to his arm, as he could not manage it with his wounded hand, and rushed with his drawn sword into the thickest of the combatants. Encouraged by the presence of their general, the Spaniards returned to the charge with such vigour, that they gradually forced their way up the steps, and drove the Mexicans to the platform at the top of the tower. There a dread∣ful carnage began, when two young Mexicans of high rank, observing Cortes as he animated his soldiers by his voice and example, resolved to sa∣crifice their own lives in order to cut off the author of all the calamities which desolated their country. They approached him in a supplicant posture, as if they had intended to lay down their arms, and seizing him in a moment, hurried him towards the battlements, over which they threw themselves
<PB N="94" REF="034476_0602_0FFDDA4CF451D068"/>
headlong, in hopes of dragging him along to be dashed in pieces by the same fall. But Cortes, by his strength and agility, broke loose from their grasp, and the gallant youths perished in this ge∣nerous though unsuccessful attempt to save their country<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Clavigero has censured me with asperity for relating this gallant action of the two Mexicans, and for supposing that there were battlements round the temple of Mexico.

As soon as the Spaniards became mas∣ters of the tower, they set fire to it, and without farther molestation, continued the preparations for their retreat.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spa∣niards a∣bandon the city.</NOTE>THIS became the more necessary, as the Mexi∣cans were so much astonished at the last effort of the Spanish valour, that they began to change their whole system of hostility, and, instead of incessant attacks, endeavoured, by barricading the streets, and breaking down the causeways, to cut off the communication of the Spaniards with the continent, and thus to starve an enemy whom they could not subdue. The first point to be determined by Cor∣tes and his followers, was, whether they should march out openly in the face of day, when they could discern every danger, and see how to regu∣late their own motions, as well as how to resist the assaults of the enemy; or, whether they should en¦deavour to retire secretly in the night? The latter was preferred, partly from hopes that their national superstition would restrain the Mexicans from ven∣turing to attack them in the night, and partly from their own fond belief in the predictions of a private sol∣dier, who having acquired universal credit by a smattering of learning, and his pretensions to astro∣logy, boldly assured his countrymen of success, if
<PB N="95" REF="034476_0603_0FFDDA4F983B8D60"/>
they made their retreat in this manner. They be∣gan to move, towards midnight, in three divisions. Sandoval led the van; Pedro Alvarado, and Ve∣lasquez de Leon, had the conduct of the rear; and Cortes commanded in the centre, where he placed the prisoners, among whom were a son and two daughters of Montezuma, together with several Mexicans of distinction, the artillery, the baggage, and a portable bridge of timber, intended to be laid over the breaches in the causeway. They marched in profound silence along the causeway which led to Tacuba, because it was shorter than any of the rest, and laying most remote from the road towards Tlascala and the sea-coast, had been left more en∣tire by the Mexicans. They reached the first breach in it without molestation, hoping that their retreat was undiscovered.</P>
<P>BUT the Mexicans, unperceived,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attacked by the Mexicans.</NOTE> had not only watched all their motions with attention, but had made proper dispositions for a most formidable at∣tack. While the Spaniards were intent upon placing their bridge in the breach, and occupied in conducting their horses and artillery along it, they were suddenly alarmed with the tremendous sound of warlike instruments, and a general shout from an innumerable multitude of enemies; the lake was covered with canoes; flights of arrows, and showers of stones poured in upon them from every quarter; the Mexicans rushing forward to the charge with fearless impetuosity, as if they hoped in that moment to be avenged for all their wrongs. Unfortunately the wooden bridge, by the weight of the artillery, was wedged so fast into the stones and mud, that it was impossible to remove it. Dismayed at this accident, the Spaniards advanced <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>h precipitation towards the second breach.

courage, yet crouded together as they were on a narrow causeway, their discipline and military skill were of little avail, nor did the obscurity of the night permit them to derive great advantage from their fire-arms, or the superiority of their other weapons. All Mexico were now in arms, and so eager were the people on the destruction of their oppressors, that they who were not near enough to annoy them in person, impatient of the delay, pressed forward with such ardour, as drove on their countrymen in the front with irresistible violence. Fresh warriors instantly filled the place of such as fell. The Spaniards, weary with slaughter, and unable to sustain the weight of the torrent that poured in upon them, began to give way. In a mo∣ment the confusion was universal; horse and foot, officers and soldiers, friends and enemies, were mingled together; and while all fought, and many fell, they could hardly distinguish from what hand the blow came.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their dis∣asters,</NOTE>CORTES, with about a hundred foot soldiers and a few horse, forced his way over the two remain∣ing breaches in the causeway, the bodies of the dead serving to fill up the chasms, and reached the main land.

<P>IN this fatal retreat many officers of distinction perished<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXII.</NOTE>, and among these Velasquez de Leon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and loss.</NOTE> who having forsaken the party of his kinsman, the governor of Cuba, to follow the fortune of his companions, was, on that account, as well as for his superior merit, respected by them as the second person in the army. All the artillery, ammunition, and baggage, were lost; the greater part of the horses, and above two thousand Tlascalans, were killed, and only a very small portion of the trea∣sure which they had amassed was saved. This, which had been always their chief object, proved a great cause of their calamity; for many of the soldiers having so overloaded themselves with bars of gold as rendered them unfit for action, and re∣tarded their flight, fell, ignominiously, the victims of their own inconsiderate avarice. Amidst so many disasters, it was some consolation to find that Aguilar and Marina, whose functions as interpreters was of such essential importance, had made their escape<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. p. 248.

<P><PB N="98" REF="034476_0606_0FFDDA57A4812378"/>THE first care of Cortes was to find some shelter for his wearied troops; for as the Mexicans infested them on every side, and the people of Tacuba began to take arms,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Difficult retreat of the Spani∣ards.</NOTE> he could not continue in his present station. He directed his march towards the rising ground, and having fortunately disco∣vered a temple situated on an eminence, took pos∣session of it. There he found not only the shelter for which he wished, but, what was no less wanted, some provisions to refresh his men; and though the enemy did not intermit their attacks through∣out the day, they were with less difficulty prevented from making any impression. During this time Cortes was engaged in deep consultation with his officers, concerning the route which they ought to take in their retreat. They were now on the west side of the lake. Tlascala, the only place where they could hope for a friendly reception, lay about sixty-four miles to the east of Mexico<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ville Segnor Teatro Americanos, lib. ii. c. 11.</NOTE>; so that they were obliged to go round the north end of the lake before they could fall into the road which led thither. A Tlascalan soldier undertook to be their guide, and conducted them through a coun∣try, in some places marshy, in other mountainous, in all ill-cultivated and thinly peopled. They marched for six days with little respite, and under continual alarms, numerous bodies of the Mexi∣cans hovering around them, sometimes harassing them at a distance with their missile weapons, and sometimes attacking them closely in front, in rear, in flank, with great boldness, as they now knew that they were not invincible. Nor were the fa∣tigue and danger of those incessant conflicts the worst evils to which they were exposed. As the barren country through which they passed afforded hardly any provisions, they were reduced to feed
<PB N="99" REF="034476_0607_0FFDDA5B8C30FCA8"/>
on berries, roots, and the stalks of green maize; and at the very time that famine was depressing their spirits and wasting their strength, their situa∣tion required the most vigorous and unremitting exertions of courage and activity. Amidst those complicated distresses, one circumstance supported and animated the Spaniards. Their commander sustained this sad reverse of fortune with unshaken magnanimity. His presence of mind never forsook him; his sagacity foresaw every event, and his vi∣gilance provided for it. He was foremost in every danger, and endured every hardship with cheer∣fulness. The difficulties with which he was sur∣rounded seemed to call forth new talents; and his soldiers, though despairing themselves, continued to follow him with encreasing confidence in his abilities.</P>
<P>ON the sixth day they arrived near to Otumba,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Otumba.</NOTE> not far from the road between Mexico and Tlas∣cala. Early next morning they began to advance towards it, flying parties of the enemy still hang∣ing on their rear; and, amidst the insolts with which they accompanied their hostilities, Marina remarked that they often exclaimed with exultation, "Go on, robbers; go to the place where you shall quickly meet the vengeance due to your crimes." The meaning of this threat the Spaniards did not com∣prehend, until they reached the summt of an eminence before them. There a spacious valley opened to their view, covered with a vast army, extending as far as the eye could reach. The Mexicans, while with one body of their troops they harassed the Spaniards in their retreat, had assembled their principal force on the other side of the lake; and marching along the road which led directly to Tlascala, posted it in the plain of Otum∣ba, through which they knew Cortes must pass. At the sight of this incredible multitude, which
<PB N="100" REF="034476_0608_0FFDDB55AFC05998"/>
they could survey at once from the rising ground, the Spaniards were astonished, and even the boldest began to despair. But Cortes, without allowing leisure for their fears to acquire strength by reflec∣tion, after warning them briefly that no alternative now remained but to conquer or to die, led them instantly to the charge. The Mexicans waited their approach with unusual fortitude. Such, how∣ever, was the superiority of the Spanish discipline and arms, that the impression of this small body was irresistible; and whichever way its force was directed, it penetrated and dispersed the most nu∣merous battalions. But while these gave way in one quarter, new combatants advanced from an∣other, and the Spaniards, though successful in every attack, were ready to sink under those re∣peated efforts, without seeing any end of their toil, or any hope of victory. At that time Cortes ob∣served the great standard of the empire, which was carried before the Mexican general, advancing; and fortunately recollecting to have heard, that on the fate of it depended the event of every battle, he assembled a few of his bravest officers, whose horses were still capable of service, and placing himself at their head, pushed forward towards the standard with an impetuosity which bore down every thing before it. A chosen body of nobles, who guarded the standard, made some resistance, but were soon broken. Cortes, with a stroke of his lance, wounded the Mexican general, and threw him to the ground. One of the Spanish officers alighting, put an end to his life, and laid hold of the Imperial standard. The moment that their leader fell, and the standard, towards which all directed their eyes, disappeared, an universal panic struck the Mexicans, and, as if the bond which held them together had been dissolved, every ensign was lowered, each soldier threw away
<PB N="101" REF="034476_0609_0FFDC54E05DCCF08"/>
his weapons, and all fled with precipitation to the mountains. The Spaniards, unable to pursue them far, returned to collect the spoils of the field, which were so valuable, as to be some compensation for the wealth which they had lost in Mexico; for in the enemy's army were most of their principal warriors, dressed out in their richest ornaments, as if they had been marching to assured victory.<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 8.</NOTE> Next day, to their great joy, they entered the Tlascalan territories.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. p. 219.

<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reception of the Spa∣niards in Tlascala.</NOTE> amidst their satisfaction in having got beyond the precincts of an hostile country, they could not look forward without solicitude, as they were still uncertain what reception they might meet with from allies, to whom they returned in a con∣dition very different from that in which they had lately set out from their dominions. Happily for them, the enmity of the Tlascalans to the Mexi∣can name was so inveterate, their desire to avenge the death of their countrymen so vehement, and the ascendant which Cortes had acquired over the chiefs of the republic so complete, that, far from entertaining a thought of taking any advantage of the distressed situation in which they beheld the Spaniards, they received them with a tenderness and cordiality, which quickly dissipated all their suspicions.</P>
<P>SOME interval of tranquillity and indulgence was now absolutely necessary;<NOTE PLACE="marg">New deli∣berations of Cortes.</NOTE> not only that the Spa∣niards might give attention to the cure of their wounds, which had been too long neglected, but in order to recruit their strength, exhausted by such a long succession of fatigue and hardships. During this, Cortes learn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>▪ that he and his com∣panions were not the only Spaniards who had felt
<PB N="102" REF="034476_0610_0FFDDA5D1FF2B600"/>
the effects of the Mexican enmity. A consider∣able detachment, which was marching from Zem∣poalla towards the capital, had been cut off by the people of Tepeaca. A smaller party, returning from Tlascala to Vera Cruz, with the share of the Mexican gold allotted to the garrison, had been surprised and destroyed in the mountains. At a juncture when the life of every Spaniard was of importance, such losses were deeply felt. The schemes which Cortes was meditating rendered them peculiarly afflictive to him. While his ene∣mies, and even many of his own followers, consi∣dered the disasters which had befallen him as fatal to the progress of his arms, and imagined that nothing now remained but speedily to abandon a country which he had invaded with unequal force, his mind, as eminent for perseverance as for enter∣prise, was still bent on accomplishing his original purpose, of subjecting the Mexican empire to the crown of Castile. Severe and unexpected as the check was which he had received, it did not ap∣pear to him a sufficient reason for relinquishing the conquests which he had already made, or against resuming his operations with better hopes of success. The colony at Vera Cruz was not only safe, but had remained unmolested. The people of Zempoalla and the adjacent districts had discovered no symptoms of defection. The Tlas∣calans continued firm to their alliance. On their martial spirit, easily roused to arms, and inflamed with implacable hatred of the Mexicans, Cortes depended for powerful aid. He had still the com∣mand of a body of Spaniards, equal in number to that with which he had opened his way into the centre of the empire, and had taken possession of the capital; so that with the benefit of greater experience, as well as more perfect knowledge of the country, he did not despair of quickly reco∣vering
<PB N="103" REF="034476_0611_0FFDDA61CE8A7D08"/>
all that he had been deprived of by untoward events.</P>
<P>FULL of this idea, he courted the Tlascalan chiefs with such attention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The mea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he takes.</NOTE> and distributed among them so liberally the rich spoils of Otumba, that he was secure of obtaining whatever he should require of the republic. He drew a small supply of am∣munition, and two or three field-pieces, from his stor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s at Vera Cruz. He dispatched an Officer of co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with four ships of Narvaez's fleet to Hispaniol<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Jamaica, to engage adventurers, and to purchase horses, gunpowder, and other military stores. As he knew that it would be vain to attempt the reduction of Mexico, unless he could secure the command of the lake, he gave orders to prepare, in the mountains of Tlascala, mate∣rials for building twelve brigantines, so as they might be carried thither in pieces ready to be put to∣gether, and launched when he stood in need of their service.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. p. 253, E. Gomara Cron. c. 117.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT while, with provident attention,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mutinous spirit of his troops.</NOTE> he was taking those necessary steps towards the execution of his measures, an obstacle arose in a quarter where it was least expected, but most formidable. The spirit of discontent and mutiny broke out in his own army. Many of Narvaez's followers were planters rather than soldiers, and had accompanied him to New Spain with sanguine hopes of obtain∣ing settlements, but with little inclination to en∣gage in the hardships and dangers of war. As the same motives had induced them to enter into their new engagements with Cortes, they no sooner became acquainted with the nature of the service, than they bitterly repented of their choice. Such of them as had the good fortune to survive the perilous adventures in which their
<PB N="104" REF="034476_0612_0FFDDA638A855048"/>
own imprudence had involved them, happy in having made their escape, trembled at the thoughts of being exposed a second time to similar cala∣mities. As soon as they discovered the intention of Cortes, they began secretly to murmur and cabal, and waxing gradually more audacious, they, in a body, offered a remonstrance to their general against the imprudence of attacking a powerful empire with his shattered forces, and formally required him to lead them back directly to Cuba. Though Cortes, long practised in the arts of command, employed arguments, intreaties, and presents, to convince or to soothe them; though his own soldiers animated with the spirit of their leader, warmly seconded his endeavours; he found their f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rs too violent and deep-rooted to be removed, and the utmost he could effect was to prevail with them to defer their departure for some time, on a promise that he would at a more proper juncture, dismiss such as should de∣sire it.</P>

He took the command in person,<NOTE PLACE="marg">August.</NOTE> accompanied by a numerous body of Tlascalans, and in the space of a few weeks, after various encounters, with great slaughter of the Tepeacans, reduced that province to subjection. During several months, while he waited for the supplies of men and ammunition which he expected, and was carrying on his pre∣parations for constructing the brigantines, he kept
<PB N="105" REF="034476_0613_0FFDDA6596172AA8"/>
his troops constantly employed in various expedi∣tions against the adjacent provinces, all of which were conducted with an uniform tenor of success. By these, his men became again accustomed to victory, and resumed their wonted sense of supe∣riority; the Mexican power was weakened; the Tlascalan warriors acquired the habit of acting in conjunction with the Spaniards; and the chiefs of the republic delighted to see their country enriched with the spoils of all the people around them, and astonished every day with fresh discoveries of the irresistible prowess of their allies, they declined no effort requisite to support them.</P>
<P>ALL, those preparatory arrangements, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Strength∣ened by se∣veral rein∣forcements.</NOTE> though the most prudent and efficacious which the situation of Cortes allowed him to make, would have been of little avail, without a reinforcement of Spanish soldiers. Of this he was so deeply sen∣sible, that it was the chief object of his thoughts and wishes; and yet his only prospect of obtaining it from the return of the officer whom he had sent to the isles to solicit aid, was both distant and un∣certain. But what neither his own sagacity nor power could have procured, he owed to a series of fortunate and unforeseen incidents. The governor of Cuba, to whom the success of Narvaez appear∣ed an event of infallible certainty, having sent two small ships after him with new instructions, and a supply of men and military stores, the officer whom Cortes had appointed to command on the coast, artfully decoyed them into the harbour of Vera Cruz, seized the vessels, and easily persuaded the soldiers to follow the standard of a more able leader than him whom they were destined to join <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.

<PB N="106" REF="034476_0614_0FFDDA6942C3D320"/>
to an armament fitted out by Francisco de Garay, governor of Jamaica, who, being possessed with the rage of discovery and conquest which animated every Spaniard settled in America, had long aimed at intruding into some district of New Spain, and dividing with Cortes the glory and gain of annexing that empire to the crown of Castile. They unad∣visedly made their attempt on the northern pro∣vinces, where the country was poor, and the peo∣ple fierce and warlike; and, after a cruel succession of disasters, famine compelled them to venture into Vera Cruz, and cast themselves upon the mercy of their countrymen.<NOTE PLACE="marg">October 28.</NOTE> Their fidelity was not proof against the splendid hopes and promises which had seduced other adventurers, and as if the spirit of revolt had been contagious in New Spain, they likewise abandoned the master whom they were bound to serve, and inlisted under Cortes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes. Relat. 253. F. B. Diaz. c. 133.</NOTE>. Nor was it America alone that furnished such unexpected aid. A ship arrived from Spain, freighted by some private merchants with military stores, in hopes of a profitable market in a country, the fame of whose opulence begun to spread over Europe. Cortes eagerly purchased a cargo which to him was inva∣luable, and the crew following the general exam∣ple, joined him at Tlascala <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. c. 136.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM those various quarters, the army of Cor∣tes was augmented with an hundred and eighty men, and twenty horses, a reinforcement too in∣considerable to produce any consequence which would entitle it to have been mentioned in the history of other parts of the globe. But in that of America, where great revolutions were brought about by causes which seemed to bear no propor∣tion to their effects, such small events rise into im∣portance,
<PB N="107" REF="034476_0615_0FFDDA6BDE926698"/>
because they were sufficient to decide with respect to the fate of kingdoms. Nor is it the least remarkable instance of the singular felicity conspi∣cuous in many passages of Cortes's story, that the two persons chiefly instrumental in furnishing him with those seasonable supplies, should be an avowed enemy who aimed at his destruction, and an envious rival who wished to supplant him.</P>
<P>THE first effect of the junction with his new fol∣lowers was to enable him to dismiss such of Nar∣vaez's soldiers as remained with reluctance in his service. After their departure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of his forces.</NOTE> he still mustered five hundred and fifty infantry, of which fourscore were armed with muskets or cross-bows, forty horsemen, and a train of nine field pieces <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 255, E.</NOTE>. At the head of these, accompanied by ten thousand Tlasca∣lans and other friendly Indians, Cortes began his march towards Mexico, on the twenty-eighth of December, six months after his disastrous retreat from that city<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Relat. 256, A.

<P>NOR did he advance to attack an enemy unpre∣pared to receive him.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepara∣tions of the Mexicans for their defence.</NOTE> Upon the death of Monte∣zuma, the Mexican chiefs, in whom the right of electing the emperor was vested, had instantly raised his brother Quetlavaca to the throne. His avowed and inveterate enmity to the Spaniards would have been sufficient to gain their suffrages, although he had been less distinguished for courage and capacity. He had an immediate opportunity of shewing that he was worthy of their choice, by conducting, in person, those fierce attacks which compelled the Spaniards to abandon his capital; and as soon as their retreat afforded him any respite from action, he took measures for preventing their return to Mexico, with prudence equal to the spirit
<PB N="108" REF="034476_0616_0FFDDA6EB625A9F0"/>
which he had displayed in driving them out of it. As from the vicinity of Tlascala, he could not be unacquainted with the motions and intentions of Cortes, he observed the storm that was gathering, and began early to provide against it. He repaired what the Spaniards had ruined in the city, and strengthened it with such new fortifications as the skill of his subjects was capable of erecting. Beside filling his magazines with the usual weapons of war, he gave directions to make long spears headed with the swords and daggers taken from the Spaniards, in order to annoy the cavalry. He summoned the people in every province of the empire to take arms against their oppressors, and as an encourage∣ment to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ert themselves with vigour, he promised them exemption from all the taxes which his pre∣decessors had imposed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. p. 253, E. 255, A. B. Diaz, c. 140.</NOTE>. But what he laboured with the greatest earnestness was, to deprive the Spaniards of the advantages which they derived from the friendship of the Tlascalans, by endea∣vouring to persuade that people to renounce all con∣nection with men, who were not only avowed ene∣mies of the gods whom they worshipped, but who would not fail at last to subject them to the same yoke, which they were now inconsiderately lending their aid to impose upon others.

that quarter of the globe, until it was introduced by the Europeans, and may be reckoned among the greatest calamities brought upon them by their in∣vaders.

<P>AS soon as Cortes entered the enemy's territo∣ries,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1521. Cortes ad∣vances to∣wards Mex∣ico.</NOTE> he discovered various preparations to obstruct his progress.

Here he determined to establish his head∣quarters, as the most proper station for launching his brigantines, as well as for making his approaches to the capital. In order to render his residence there more secure, he deposed the cazique or chief, who was at the head of that community, under pretext of some defect in his title, and substituted in his place a person whom a faction of the nobles pointed out as the right heir of that dignity. At∣tached to him by this benefit, the new cazique and his adherents served the Spaniards with inviolable fidelity.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 256, &amp;c. B. Diaz. c. 137.

to turn his arms directly against the capital. To have attacked, at this period, a city so popu∣lous, so well prepared for defence, and in a situa∣tion of such peculiar strength, must have exposed his troops to inevitable destruction. Three months elapsed before the materials for the brigantines were finished, and before he heard my thing with respect to the success of the officer whom he had sent to Hispaniola. This, however, was not a season of inaction to Cortes. He attacked succes∣sively several of the towns situated around the lake; and though all the Mexican power was exerted to obstruct his operations, he either compelled them to submit to the Spanish crown, or reduced them to ruins. The inhabitants of other towns he en∣deavoured to conciliate by more gentle means, and though he could not hold any intercourse with them but by the intervention of interpreters, yet, under all the disadvantage of that tedious and imperfect mode of communication, he had acquired such thorough knowledge of the state of the country, as well as of the dispositions of the people, that he conducted his negociations and intrigues with asto∣nishing dexterity and success. Most of the cities adjacent to Mexico were originally the capitals of small independent states; and some of them having been but lately annexed to the Mexican empire, still retained the remembrance of their ancient li∣berty, and bore with impatience the rigorous yoke of their new masters. Cortes having early observed symptoms of their disaffection, availed himself of this knowledge to gain their confidence and friend∣ship. By offering, with confidence, to deliver them from the odious dominion of the Mexicans, and by liberal promises of more indulgent treat∣ment, if they would unite with him against their oppressors, he prevailed on the people of several considerable districts, not only to acknowledge the

king of Castile as their sovereign, but to supply the Spanish camp with provisions, and to strengthen his army with auxiliary troops. Guatimozin, on the first appearance of defection among his sub∣jects, exerted himself with vigour to prevent or to punish their revolt; but in spite of his efforts, the spirit continued to spread. The Spaniards gradually acquired new allies, and with deep concern he be∣held Cortes arming against his empire those very hands which ought to have been active in its defence; and ready to advance against the capi∣tal at the head of a numerous body of his own sub∣jects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 256—260.

<P>WHILE, by those various methods, Cortes was gradually circumscribing the Mexican power in such a manner that his prospect of overturning it seemed neither to be uncertain nor remote, all his schemes were well nigh defeated, by a conspi∣racy no less unexpected than dangerous. The soldiers of Narvaez had never united perfectly with the original companions of Cortes; nor did they enter into his measures with the same cordial zeal. Upon every occasion that required any extraordi∣nary effort of courage or of patience, their spirits were apt to sink; and now, on a near view of what they had to encounter, in attempting to reduce a city so inaccessible as Mexico, and defended by a numerous army, the resolution even of those among them who had adhered to Cortes when he was de∣serted by their associates, began to fail. Their fears led them to presumptuous and unsoldier-like dis∣cussions concerning the propriety of their general's measures, and the improbability of their success. From these they proceeded to censure and invec∣tives, and at last began to deliberate how they
<PB N="112" REF="034476_0620_0FFDDA794EB4D8C8"/>
might provide for their own safety, of which they deemed their commander to be totally negligent. Antonio Villefagna, a private soldier, but bold, intriguing, and strongly attached to Velasquez, art∣fully fomented this growing spirit of disaffection. His quarters became the rendezvous of the mal∣contents, where, after many consultations, they could discover no method of checking Cortes in his career, but by assassinating him and his most considerable officers, and conferring the command upon some person who would relinquish his wild plans, and adopt measures more consistent with the general security. Despair inspired them with cou∣rage. The hour for perpetrating the crime, the persons whom they destined as victims, the officers to succeed them in command, were all named; and the conspirators signed an association, by which they bound themselves with most solemn oaths to mutual fidelity. But on the evening before the appointed day, one of Cortes's ancient followers, who had been seduced into the conspiracy, touched with compunction at the imminent danger of a man whom he had long been accustomed to revere, or struck with horror at his own treachery, went pri∣vately to his general, and revealed to him all that he knew. Cortes, though deeply alarmed, dis∣cerned at once what conduct was proper in a situa∣tion so critical. He repaired instantly to Ville∣fagna's quarters, accompanied by some of his most trusty officers. The astonishment and confusion of the man at this unexpected visit anticipated the confession of his guilt. Cortes, while his attendants seized the traitor, snatched from his bosom a paper containing the association, signed by the conspira∣tors. Impatient to know how far the defection extended, he retired to read it, and found there names which filled him with surprise and sorrow. But, aware how dangerous a strict scrutiny might
<PB N="113" REF="034476_0621_0FFDDA7C0F029338"/>
prove at such a juncture, he confined his judicial in∣quiries to Villefagna alone. As the proofs of his guilt were manifest, he was condemned after a short trial,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1521.</NOTE> and next morning he was seen hanging before the door of the house in which he had lodged. Cortes called his troops together, and having explained to them the atrocious purpose of the conspirators, as well as the justice of the punishment inflicted on Villefagna, he added, with an appearance of satis∣faction, that he was entirely ignorant with respect to all the circumstances of this dark transaction, as the traitor, when arrested, had suddenly torn and swallowed a paper which probably contained an account of it, and under the severest tortures pos∣sessed such constancy as to conceal the names of his accomplices. This artful declaration restored tranquillity to many a breast that was throbbing, while he spoke, with consciousness of guilt and dread of detection; and by this prudent modera∣tion, Cortes had the advantage of having disco∣vered, and of being able to observe such of his followers as were disaffected; while they, flatter∣ing themselves that their past crime was unknown, endeavoured to avert any suspicion of it, by re∣doubling their activity and zeal in his service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 283.

Fortunately, a proper occasion for this occurred without his seeming to court it. He received intelligence that the materials for building the brigantines were at length completely finished, and waited only for a body of Spaniards to conduct them to Tezeuco. The command of this convoy, consisting of two hundred foot sol∣diers,
<PB N="114" REF="034476_0622_0FFDDA7D9FCA61C8"/>
fifteen horsemen, and two field-pieces, he gave to Sandoval, who, by the vigilance, activity, and courage which he manifested on every occa∣sion, was growing daily in his confidence, and in the estimation of his fellow-soldiers. The service was no less singular than important; the beams, the planks, the masts, the cordage, the sails, the iron-work, and all the infinite variety of articles requisite for the construction of thirteen brigantines, were to be carried sixty miles over land, through a mountainous country, by people who were unac∣quainted with the ministry of domestic animals, or the aid of machines to facilitate any work of la∣bour. The Tlascalans furnished eight thousand <HI>Tamenes,</HI> an inferior order of men destined for ser∣vile tasks, to carry the materials on their shoul∣ders, and appointed fifteen thousand warriors to accompany and defend them. Sandoval made the disposition for their progress with great propriety, placing the <HI>Tamenes</HI> in the centre, one body of warriors in the front, another in the rear, with con∣siderable parties to cover the flanks. To each of these he joined some Spaniards, not only to as∣sist them in danger, but to accustom them to re∣gularity and subordination. A body so numerous, and so much encumbered, advanced leisurely, but in excellent order; and in some places, where it was confined by the woods or mountains, the line of march extended above six miles. Parties of Mexicans frequently appeared hovering around them on the high grounds; but perceiving no prospect of success in attacking an enemy conti∣nually on his guard, and prepared to receive them, they did not venture to molest him; and Sandoval had the glory of conducting safely to Tezeuco, a convoy on which all the future operations of his countrymen depended <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 260.

<P><PB N="115" REF="034476_0623_0FFDDA8144A95C00"/>THIS was followed by another event of no less moment.

Elevated with observing that all his preparatory schemes, either for recruiting his own army, or impairing the force of the enemy, had now produced their full effect, Cortes, impatient to begin the siege in form, has∣tened the launching of the brigantines. To fa∣cilitate this, he had employed a vast number of Indians for two months in deepening the small ri∣vulet which runs by Tezeuco into the lake, and in forming it into a canal near two miles in length<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXIII.</NOTE>; and though the Mexicans, aware of his intentions, as well as of the danger which threatened them, endeavoured frequently to interrupt the labourers, or to burn the brigantines, the work was at last completed<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">B.

On the twenty-eighth of April,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The bri∣gantines launche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> all the Spanish troops, together with the auxiliary In∣dians, were drawn up on the banks of the canal; and with extraordinary military pomp, rendered more solemn by the celebration of the most sacred rites of religion, the brigantines were launched. As they fell down the canal in order, Father Ol∣medo blessed them, and gave each its name. Every eye followed them with wonder and hope, until they entered the lake, when they hoisted their sails, and bore away before the wind. A general shout of joy was raised; all admiring that bold in∣ventive genius, which, by means so extraordinary that their success almost exceeded belief, had ac∣quired the command of a fleet, without the aid of which Mexico would have continued to set the Spanish power and arms at defiance<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 266, C.

<P><PB N="117" REF="034476_0625_0FFDDA859FD886E0"/>THE first effort of the Mexicans was to destroy the fleet of brigantines, the fatal effects of whose operations they foresaw and dreaded. Though the brigantines,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mexicans attack the brigantines.</NOTE> after all the labour and merit of Cortes in forming them, were of inconsiderable bulk, rudely constructed, and manned chiefly with land∣men, hardly possessed of skill enough to conduct them, they must have been objects of terror to a people unacquainted with any navigation but that of their lake, and possessed of no vessel larger than a canoe. Necessity, however, urged Guatimozin to hazard the attack; and hoping to supply by numbers what he wanted in force, he assembled such a multitude of canoes as covered the face of the lake. They rowed on boldly to the charge, while the brigantines, retarded by a dead calm, could scarcely advance to meet them. But as the enemy drew near, a breeze suddenly sprung up;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Repulsed.</NOTE> in a moment the sails were spread, the brigantines, with the utmost ease, broke through their feeble opponents, overset many canoes, and dissipated the whole armament with such slaughter, as convinced the Mexicans, that the progress of the Europeans in knowledge and arts rendered their superiority greater on this new element, than they had hitherto found it by land <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 267, C.

Cortes formed the brigantines in three divisions, appointing one to cover each of
<PB N="118" REF="034476_0626_0FFDDA8A4DF0AA20"/>
the stations from which an attack was to be car∣ried on against the city, with orders to second the operations of the officer who commanded there. From all the three stations he pushed on the attack against the city with equal vigour; but in a manner so very different from the conduct of sieges in regu∣lar war, that he himself seems afraid it would appear no less improper than singular, to persons un∣acquainted with his situation<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 270, F.</NOTE>. Each morning his troops assaulted the barricades which the enemy had erected on the causeways, forced their way over the trenches which they had dug, and through the canals where the bridges were broken down, and endeavoured to penetrate into the heart of the city, in hopes of obtaining some decisive advantage, which might force the enemy to surrender, and terminate the war at once; but when the obstinate valour of the Mexicans rendered the efforts of the day ineffectual, the Spaniards retired in the even∣ing to their former quarters. Thus their toil and danger were, in some measure, continually renew∣ed; the Mexicans repairing in the night what the Spaniards had destroyed through the day, and re∣covering the posts from which they had driven them. But necessity prescribed this slow and un∣toward mode of operation. The number of his troops were so small, that Cortes durst not, with a handful of men, attempt to make a lodgment in a city where he might be surrounded and annoyed by such a multitude of enemies. The remem∣brance of what he had already suffered by the ill-judged confidence with which he had ventured into such a dangerous situation, was still fresh in his mind. The Spaniards, exhausted with fatigue, were unable to guard the various posts which they daily gained; and though their camp was filled
<PB N="119" REF="034476_0627_0FFDDA8BDD6C70B0"/>
with Indian auxiliaries, they durst not devolve this charge upon them, because they were so little ac∣customed to discipline, that no confidence could be placed in their vigilance. Besides this, Cortes was extremely solicitous to preserve the city as much as possible from being destroyed, both because he destined it to be the capital of his conquests, and wished that it might remain as a monument of his glory. From all these considerations, he ad∣hered obstinately, for a month after the siege was opened, to the system which he had adopted. The Mexicans, in their own defence, displayed valour which was hardly inferior to that with which the Spaniards attacked them. On land, on water, by night and by day, one furious conflict suc∣ceeded to another. Several Spaniards were killed, more wounded, and all were ready to sink under the toils of unintermitting service, which were rendered more intolerable by the injuries of the season, the periodical rains being now set in with their usual violence<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">B.

<P>ASTONISHED and disconcerted with the length and difficulties of the siege,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Endeavours to take the city by storm.</NOTE> Cortes determined to make one great effort to get possession of the city, before he relinquished the plan which he had hi∣therto followed, and had recourse to any other mode of attack.

Animated by his presence, and the expectation of some decisive event,<NOTE PLACE="marg">July 3.</NOTE> the Spaniards pushed forward with irresistible impetuosity.

<PB N="120" REF="034476_0628_0FFDDA8EB04A2308"/>
spite of the multitude and ferocity of their oppo∣nents. Cortes, though delighted with the rapidity of his progress, did not forget that he might still find it necessary to retreat; and in order to secure it, appointed Julien de Alderete, a captain of chief note in the troops which he had received from Hispaniola, to fill up the canals and gaps in the causeway as the main body advanced. That offi∣cer, deeming it inglorious to be thus employed, while his companions were in the heat of action and the career of victory, neglected the important charge committed to him, and hurried on, incon∣siderately, to mingle with the combatants. The Mexicans, whose military attention and skill were daily improving, no sooner observed this, than they carried an account of it to their monarch.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Repulsed.</NOTE>GUATIMOZIN instantly discerned the conse∣quence of the error which the Spaniards had com∣mitted, and, with admirable presence of mind, prepared to take advantage of it. He commanded the troops posted in the front to slacken their ef∣forts, in order to allure the Spaniards to push for∣ward, while he dispatched a large body of chosen warriors through different streets, some by land, and others by water, towards the great breach in the causeway, which had been left open. On a signal which he gave, the priests in the principal temple struck the great drum consecrated to the god of war. No sooner did the Mexicans hear its doleful solemn sound, calculated to inspire them with contempt of death and enthusiastic ardour, than they rushed upon the enemy with frantic rage. The Spaniards, unable to resist men urged on no less by religious fury than hope of success, began to retire, at first leisurely, and with a good coun∣tenance; but as the enemy pressed on, and their own impatience to escape increased, the terror and confusion became so general, that when they ar∣rived

at the gap in the causeway, Spaniards and Tlascalans, horsemen and infantry, plunged in promiscuously, while the Mexicans rushed upon them fiercely from every side, their light canoes carrying them through shoales which the brigantines could not approach. In vain did Cortes attempt to stop and rally his flying troops; fear rendered them regardless of his entreaties or commands. Finding all his endeavours to renew the combat fruitless, his next care was to save some of those who had thrown themselves into the water; but while thus employed, with more attention to their situation than to his own, six Mexican captains suddenly laid hold of him, and were hurrying him off in triumph; and though two of his officers rescued him at the expence of their own lives, he received several dangerous wounds before he could break loose.<NOTE PLACE="marg">with consi∣derable loss.</NOTE> Above sixty Spaniards perished in the rout; and what rendered the disaster more afflicting, forty of these fell alive into the hands of an enemy never known to shew mercy to a captive<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. p. 273.

calamity similar to that which they still bewailed. As the Spaniards pushed forward, the Indians re∣gularly repaired the causeways behind them. As soon as they got possession of any part of the town, the houses were instantly levelled with the ground. Day by day, the Mexicans, forced to re∣tire as their enemies gained ground, were hemmed in within more narrow limits. Guatimozin, though unable to stop the career of the enemy, continued to defend his capital with obstinate resolution, and disputed every inch of ground. The Spaniards not only varied their mode of attack, but, by or∣der of Cortes, change <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the weapons with which they fought. They were again armed with the long Chinantlan spears, which they had employed with such success against Narvaez; and, by the firm array in which this enabled them to range them∣selves, they repelled, with little danger, the loose assault of the Mexicans: incredible numbers of them fell in the conflicts which they renewed every day<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. p. 275, C. 276, F.

The Spanish brigan∣tines, having the entire command of the lake, ren∣dered it almost impossible to convey to the besieged any supply of provisions by water. The immense number of his Indian auxiliaries enabled Cortes to shut up the avenues to the city by land.

<P>July 27.</P></NOTE> disdain∣ing the idea of submitting to the oppressors of his country, determined not to survive its ruin. The Spaniards continued their progress. At length all the three divisions penetrated into the great square in the centre of the city, and made a secure lodge∣ment there. Three fourths of the city were now reduced, and laid in ruins. The remaining quar∣ter was so closely pressed, that it could not long withstand assailants, who attacked it from their new station with superior advantage, and more assured expectation of success. The Mexican nobles, soli∣citous to save the life of a monarch whom they revered, prevailed on Guatimozin to retire from a place where resistance was now vain, that he might rouse the more distant provinces of the empire to arms, and maintain there a more successful struggle with the public enemy. In order to facilitate the execution of this measure, they endeavoured to amuse Cortes with overtures of submission, that, while his attention was employed in adjusting the articles of pacification, Guatimozin might escape unperceived. But they made this attempt upon a leader of greater sagacity and discernment than to be deceived by their arts. Cortes suspecting their intention, and aware of what moment it was to de∣feat it, appointed Sandoval, the officer on whose vigilance he could most perfectly rely, to take the command of the brigantines, with strict injunctions to watch every motion of the enemy. Sandoval, attentive to the charge, observing some large ca∣noes crowded with people rowing across the lake with extraordinary rapi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, instantly gave the sig∣nal to chace.

and was preparing to fire on the foremost canoe, which seemed to carry some person whom all the rest followed and obeyed. At once the rowers dropt their oars,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is taken prisoner.</NOTE> and all on board, throwing down their arms, conjured him with cries and tears to forbear, as the emperor was there. Holguin eagerly seized his prize, and Guatimozin, with a dignified com∣posure, gave himself up into his hands, requesting only that no insult might be offered to the empress or his children. When conducted to Cortes, he appeared neither with the sullen fierceness of a bar∣barian, nor with the dejection of a supplicant. "I have done," said he, addressing himself to the Spa∣nish general, "what became a monarch. I have defended my people to the last extremity. Nothing now remains but to die. Take this dagger," lay∣ing his hand on one which Cortes wore, "plant it in my breast, and put an end to a life which can no longer be of use<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 279. B.

It conti∣nued seventy-five days, hardly one of which passed without some extraordinary effort of one party in the attack, or of the other in the defence of a city, on the fate of which both knew that the fortune of the empire depended. As the struggle here was more obstinate, it was likewise more equal, than any between the inhabitants of the Old and New Worlds. The great abilities of Guatimozin, the number of his troops, the peculiar situation of his capital, so far counterbalanced the superiority of

the Spaniards in arms and discipline, that they must have relinquished the enterprise, if they had trusted for success to themselves alone. But Mexico was overturned by the jealousy of neighbours who dreaded its power, and by the revolt of subjects impatient to shake off its yoke. By their effectual aid, Cortes was enabled to accomplish what, with∣out such support, he would hardly have ventured to attempt. How much soever this account of the reduction of Mexico may detract, on the one hand, from the marvellous relations of some Spanish wri∣ters, by ascribing that to simple and obvious causes which they attribute to the romantic valour of their countrymen, it adds, on the other, to the merit and abilities of Cortes, who, under every disadvantage, acquired such an ascendant over unknown nations, as to render them instruments towards carrying his schemes into execution<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE exultation of the Spaniards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Smallness of the boo∣ty, and dis∣appoint∣ment of the Spaniards.</NOTE> on accom∣plishing this arduous enterprise, was at first exces∣sive. But this was quickly damped by the cruel disappointment of those sanguine hopes, which had animated them amidst so many hardships and dan∣gers. Instead of the inexhaustible wealth which they expected from becoming masters of Monte∣zuma's treasures, and the ornaments of so many temples, their rapaciousness could collect only an inconsiderable booty amidst ruins and desolation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The gold and silver, according to Cortes, amounted only to 120,000 pesos, Relat. 280, A. a sum much inferior to that which the Spaniards had formerly divided in Mexico.</NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Guatimo∣zin tor∣tured.</NOTE>ARGUMENTS, intreaties, and promises were em∣ployed in order to soothe them, but with so little effect, that Cortes, from solicitude to check this growing spirit of discontent, gave way to a deed which stains the glory of all his great actions.

Guatimozin bore whatever the refined cruelty of his tormentors could inflict, with the invincible fortitude of an American warrior. His fellow-sufferer, overcome by the violence of the anguish, turned a dejected eye towards his master, which seemed to implore his permission to reveal all that he knew. But the high-spirited prince, darting on him a look of authority mingled with scorn, checked his weakness by asking, "Am I now reposing on a bed of flowers?" Overawed by the reproach, the favourite persevered in his dutiful silence, and expired.

But as his general would not grant his suit, and he expected greater justice from his sovereign, whom he knew to be a good judge and a generous rewarder of merit, he quitted India abruptly, and returned to Lisbon. In order to induce Emanuel to listen more favourably to his
<PB N="130" REF="034476_0638_0FFDDAAA751D3E88"/>
claim, he not only stated his past services, but of∣fered to add to them by conducting his countrymen to the Molucca or Spice Island<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, by holding a westerly course; which he contended would be both shorter and less hazardous than that which the Por∣tuguese now followed by the Cape of Good Hope, through the immense extent of the Eastern Ocean. This was the original and favourite project of Co∣lumbus, and Magellan founded his hopes of success on the ideas of that great navigator, confirmed by many observations, the result of his own naval ex∣perience, as well as that of his countrymen in their intercourse with the East. But though the Portu∣guese monarchs had the merit of having first awakened and encouraged the spirit of discovery in that age, it was their destiny, in the course of a few years, to reject two grand schemes for this purpose, the execution of which would have been attended with a great accession of glory to them∣selves, and of power to their kingdom. In conse∣quence of some ill-founded prejudice against Ma∣gellan, or of some dark intrigue which contempo∣rary historians have not explained, Emanuel would neither bestow the recompence which he claimed, nor approve of the scheme which he proposed; and dismissed him with a disdainful coldness intolerable to a man conscious of what he deserved, and ani∣mated with the sanguine hopes of success peculiar to those who are capable of forming or conducting new and great undertakings. In a transport of resentment, Magellan formally renounced his alle∣giance to an ungrateful master,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1517.</NOTE> and fled to the court of Castile, where he expected that his talents would be more justly estimated. He endeavoured to recommend himself by offering to execute, un∣der the patronage of Spain, that scheme, which he had laid before the court of Portugal, the accom∣plishment of which, he knew, would wound the
<PB N="131" REF="034476_0639_0FFDDAAC08CC3280"/>
monarch against whom he was exasperated in the most tender part. In order to establish the justness of his theory, he produced the same arguments which he had employed at Lisbon; acknowledging, at the same time, that the undertaking was both arduous and expensive, as it could not be attempted but with a squadron of considerable force, and vic∣tualled for at least two years. Fortunately, he ap∣plied to a minister who was not apt to be deterred, either by the boldness of a design, or the expence of carrying it into execution. Cardinal Ximenes, who at that time directed the affairs of Spain, dis∣cerning at once what an increase of wealth and glory would accrue to his country by the success of Magellan's proposal, listened to it with a most fa∣vourable ear. Charles V. on his arrival in his Spa∣nish dominions, entered into the measure with no less ardour, and orders were issued for equipping a proper squadron at the public charge, of which the command was given to Magellan, whom the king honoured with the habit of St. Jago and the title of Captain General<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. ii. c. 19. lib. iv. c. 9.

The crews of the whole amounted to two hundred and thirty-four men, among whom were some of the most skilful pilots in Spain, and several Portuguese sailors, in whose experience, as more extensive, Magellan placed still greater confidence. After touching at the Canaries, he stood directly south towards the

On the thirty-first of March he arrive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in the port of St. Julian, about forty-eight degrees south of the line, where he resolved to winter. In this uncomfortable station he lost one of his squad∣ron, and the Spaniards suffered so much from the excessive rigour of the climate, that the crews of three of his ships, headed by their officers, rose in open mutiny, and insisted on relinquishing the visionary project of a desperate adventurer, and returning directly to Spain. This dangerous in∣surrection Magellan suppressed, by an effort of courage no less prompt than intrepid, and inflicted exemplary punishment on the ringleaders. With the remainder of his followers, overawed but not reconciled to his scheme, he continued his voyage towards the south, and at length discovered, near the fifty-third degree of latitude, the mouth of a strait, into which he entered, notwithstanding the murmurs and remonstrances of the people under his command. After sailing twenty days in that winding dangerous channel, to which he gave his own name, and where one of his ships deserted him, the great Southren Ocean opened to his view, and with tears of joy he returned thanks to

<P>BUT he was still at a greater distance than he imagined from the object of his wishes. He sailed during three months and twenty days in an uni∣form direction towards the north-west, without dis∣covering land. In this voyage, the longest that had ever been made in the unbounded ocean, he suffered incredible distress. His stock of provi∣sions was almost exhausted, the water became putrid, the men were reduced to the shorted al∣lowance with which it was possible to sustain life, and the scurvy, the most dreadful of all the mala∣dies with which sea-faring people are afflicted, be∣gan to spread among the crew. One circumstance alone afforded them some consolation; they en∣joyed an uninterrupted course of fair weather, with such favourable winds, that Magellan bestowed on that ocean the name of <HI>Pacific,</HI> which it still retains. When reduced to such extremity that they must have sunk under their sufferings, they fell in with a cluster of small but fertile islands,<NOTE PLACE="marg">March 6.</NOTE> which afforded them refreshments in such abundance, that their health was soon re-established.

<P>THOUGH an untimely fate deprived Magellan of the satisfaction of accomplishing this great un∣dertaking, his contemporaries, just to his memory and talents, ascribed to him not only the honour of having formed the plan, but of having sur∣mounted almost every obstacle to the completion of it; and in the present age his name is still ranked among the highest in the roll of eminent and successful navigators. The naval glory of Spain
<PB N="135" REF="034476_0643_0FFDDAB6D9ADBEE8"/>

<P>THE Spaniards were not satisfied with the glory of having first encompassed the earth; they expected to derive great commercial advantages from this new and boldest effort of their maritime skill. The men of science among them contended, that the spice islands, and several of the richest coun∣tries in the East, were so situated as to belong of right to the crown of Castile, in consequence of the partition made by Alexander VI. The mer∣chants, without attending to this discussion, en∣gaged early in that lucrative and alluring com∣merce, which was now opened to them. The Portuguese, alarmed at the intrusion of such for∣midable rivals, remonstrated and negociated in Europe, while in Asia they obstructed the trade of the Spaniards by force of arms. Charles V. not sufficiently instructed with respect to the import∣ance of this valuable branch of commerce, or distracted by the multiplicity of his schemes and operations, did not afford his subjects proper pro∣tection. At last, the low state of his finances, ex∣hausted by the efforts of his arms in every part of Europe, together with the dread of adding a new war with Portugal to those in which he was already engaged, induced him to make over his claim of the Moluccas to the Portuguese for three hundred and fifty thousand ducats. He reserved, however, to the crown of Castile the right of reviving its pretentions on repayment of that sum; but other objects engrossed his attention and that of his suc∣cessors; and Spain was finally excluded from a

<P>THOUGH the trade with the Moluccas was relin∣quished, the voyage of Magellan was followed by commercial effects of great moment to Spain.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An order to supersede Cortes,</NOTE>AT the time that Cortes was acquiring such ex∣tensive territories for his native country, and pre∣paring the way for future conquests, it was his sin∣gular fate not only to be destitute of any commis∣sion or authority from the sovereign whom he was serving with such successful zeal, but to be regarded as an undutiful and seditious subject. By the in∣fluence of Fonseca, bishop of Burgos, his conduct in assuming the government of New Spain was declared to be an irregular usurpation, in contempt of the royal authority; and Christoval de Tapia received a commission, impowering him to super∣sede Cortes, to seize his person, to confiscate his effects, to make a strict scrutiny into his proceed∣ings, and to transmit the result of all the enquiries carried on in New Spain to the council of the In∣dies, of which the bishop of Burgos was president. A few weeks after the reduction of Mexico, Tapia landed at Vera Cruz with the royal mandate to strip its conqueror of his power, and to treat him as a criminal. But Fonseca had chosen a very improper instrument to wreak his vengeance on Cortes. Tapia had neither the reputation nor the

The juncture in which his deputies reached the court was favourable.

He determined to establish the seat of government in its ancient sta∣tion, and to raise Mexico again from its ruins; and having conceived high ideas concerning the future grandeur of the state of which he was laying the foundation, he began to rebuild its capital on a plan which hath gradually formed the most magni∣ficent city in the New World. At the same time, he employed skilful persons to search for mines in different parts of the country, and opened some which were found to be richer than any which the Spaniards had hitherto discovered in America. He detached his principal officers into the remote pro∣vinces,
<PB N="139" REF="034476_0647_0FFDDAC21FFE23C8"/>
and encouraged them to settle there, not only by bestowing upon them large tracts of land, but by granting them the same dominion over the Indians, and the same right to their service, which the Spaniards had assumed in the islands.</P>
<P>IT was not, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Insurrecti∣ons of the Mexicans, and cruelty of the Spa∣niards.</NOTE> without difficulty that the Mexican empire could be entirely reduced into the form of a Spanish colony. Enraged and ren∣dered desperate by oppression, the natives often forgot the superiority of their enemies, and ran to arms in defence of their liberties. In every con∣test, however, the European valour and discipline prevailed. But fatally for the honour of their country, the Spaniards sullied the glory redound∣ing from these repeated victories by their mode of treating the vanquished people. After taking Guatimozin, and becoming masters of his capital, they supposed that the king of Castile entered on possession of all the rights of the captive monarch, and affected to consider every effort of the Mexicans to assert their own independence, as the rebellion of vassals against their sovereign, or the mutiny of slaves against their master. Under the sanction of those ill-founded maxims, they violated every right that should be held sacred between hostile nations. After each insurrection, they reduced the common people in the provinces which they sub∣dued, to the most humiliating of all conditions, that of personal servitude. Their chiefs, supposed to be more criminal, were punished with greater severity, and put to death in the most ignominious or the most excruciating mode, that the insolence or the cruelty of their conquerors could devise. In almost every district of the Mexican empire, the progress of the Spanish arms is marked with blood, and with deeds so atrocious, as disgrace the enter∣prising valour that conducted them to success. In the country of Panuco, sixty ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iques or leaders,
<PB N="140" REF="034476_0648_0FFDDAC3EAEE43D0"/>
and four hundred nobles, were burnt at one time. Nor was this shocking barbarity perpetrated in any sudden sally of rage, or by a commander of inferior note. It was the act of Sandoval, an officer whose name is entitled to the second rank in the annals of New Spain, and executed after a solemn consultation with Cortes; and to complete the horror of the scene, the children and relations of the wretched victims were assembled, and compelled to be spec∣tators of their dying agonies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. 291, C. Gomara Cron. c. 155.</NOTE>. It seems hardly possible to exceed in horror this dreadful example of severity; but it was followed by another, which affected the Mexicans still more sensibly, as it gave them a most feeling proof of their own degradation, and of the small regard which their haughty masters retained for the ancient dignity and splen∣dour of their state. On a slight suspicion, con∣firmed by very imperfect evidence, that Guati∣mozin had formed a scheme to shake off the yoke, and to excite his former subjects to take arms, Cortes, without the formality of a trial, ordered the unhappy monarch, together with the caziques of Tezeuco and Tacuba, the two persons of greatest eminence in the empire, to be hanged; and the Mexicans, with astonishment and horror, beheld this disgraceful punishment inflicted upon persons, to whom they were accustomed to look up with reverence, hardly inferior to that which they paid to the gods themselves<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gomara Cron. c. 170.

<P>BUT, amidst those external proofs of regard,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the go∣vernment in New Spain.</NOTE> symptoms of remaining distrust appeared. Though Cortes earnestly solicited to be reinstated in the government of New Spain, Charles, too sagacious to commit such an important charge to a man whom he had once suspected, peremptorily refused to invest him again with powers which he might find it imposible to controul. Cortes, though dignified with new titles, returned to Mexico with diminished authority. The military department, with powers to attempt new discoveries, was left in his hands; but the supreme direction of civil affairs was placed in a board, called <HI>The Audience of New Spain.</HI> At a subsequent period, when, upon the increase of the colony, the exertion of authority more united and extensive became necessary, An∣tonio de Mendoza, a nobleman of high rank, was sent thither as <HI>Viceroy,</HI> to take the government into his hands.</P>

He early entertained an idea, that, either by steering through the gulf of Florida along the east coast of North America, some strait would be found that communicated with the west∣ern

The emperor behaved to him with cold civility; his ministers treated him, sometimes with neglect, sometimes with insolence. His grievances received no redress; his claims were urged without effect; and after several years spent in fruitless application to ministers and judges, an occupation the most irksome and mortifying to a man of high spirit, who had moved in a sphere where he was more accustomed to command than to solicit, Cortes ended his days on the second of December one thousand five hundred and forty-seven, in the sixty-second year of his age. His fate was the same with that of all the persons who distinguished themselves in the discovery or con∣quest of the New World.

In an age when the spirit of adventure was so ardent and vigorous, that large fortunes were wasted, and the most alarming dangers braved, in pursuit of discoveries merely possible, the faintest ray of hope was followed with an eager expectation, and the slightest information was sufficient to inspire such perfect confidence, as conducted men to the most arduous undertakings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXIX.</NOTE>.</P>

were unequal to the attempt<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Calancha Coronica, p. 100.</NOTE>. As the excursions of those adventurers did not extend beyond the limits of the province to which the Spaniards have given the name of Tierra Firme, a mountainous region covered with woods, thinly inhabited, and extremely unhealthy, they returned with dismal accounts concerning the distresses to which they had been exposed, and the unpromising aspect of the places which they had visited. Damped by these tidings, the rage for discovery in that direc∣tion abated; and it became the general opinion, that Balboa had founded visionary hopes, on the tale of an ignorant Indian, ill understood, or cal∣culated to deceive.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Undertaken by Pizarro, Almagro, and Luque. 1524.</NOTE>BUT there were three persons settled in Panama, on whom the circumstances which deterred others made so little impression, that at the very moment when all considered Balboa's expectations of disco∣vering a rich country, by steering towards the east, as chimerical, they resolved to attempt the execu∣tion of his scheme. The names of those extraor∣dinary men were Francisco Pizarro, Diego de Almagro, and Hernando Luque. Pizarro was the natural son of a gentleman of an honourable family by a very low woman, and according to the cruel fate which often attends the offspring of unlawful love, had been so totally neglected in his youth by the author of his birth, that he seems to have destined him never to rise beyond the con∣dition of his mother. In consequence of this unge∣nerous idea, he set him, when bordering on man∣hood, to keep hogs. But the aspiring mind of young Pizarro disdaining that ignoble occupation, he abruptly abandoned his charge, enlisted as a sol∣dier, and, after serving some years in Italy, em∣barked for America, which, by opening such a

With a temper of mind no less daring than the constitution of his body was robust, he was foremost in every danger, patient under the greatest hardships, and unsubdued by any fatigue. Though so illiterate that he could not even read, he was soon considered as a man formed to com∣mand. Every operation committed to his conduct proved successful, as, by a happy but rare conjunc∣tion, he united perseverance with ardour, and was as cautious in executing, as he was bold in forming his plans. By engaging early in active life, with∣out any resource but his own talents and industry, and by depending on himself alone in his struggles to emerge from obscurity, he acquired such a thorough knowledge of affairs, and of men, that he was fitted to assume a superior part in conducting the former, and in governing the latter<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 1 &amp; 2, passim. dec. 4. lib. vi. c. 107.

<P>ALMAGRO had as little to boast of his descent as Pizarro. The one was a bastard, the other a found∣ling. Bred, like his companion, in the camp, he yielded not to him in any of the soldierly qualities of intrepid valour, indefatigable activity, or insur∣mountable constancy in enduring the hardships in∣separable from military service in the New World. But in Almagro these virtues were accompanied with the openness, generosity, and candour, natural to men whose profession is arms; in Pizarro, they were united with the address, the craft, and the dissimulation of a politician, with the art of con∣cealing his own purposes, and with sagacity to pene∣trate into those of other men.</P>

Their confederacy for this purpose was authorised by Pedrarias, the governor of Panama. Each en∣gaged to employ his whole fortune in the adven∣ture. Pizarro, the least wealthy of the three, as he could not throw so large a sum as his associates into the common stock, engaged to take the de∣partment of greatest fatigue and danger, and to command in person the armament which was to go first upon discovery. Almagro offered to con∣duct the supplies of provisions and reinforcements of troops, of which Pizzaro might stand in need. Luque was to remain at Panama to negociate with the governor, and superintend whatever was carry∣ing on for the general interest. As the spirit of en∣thusiasm uniformly accompanied that of adventure in the New World, and by that strange union both acquired an increase of force, this confederacy, formed by ambition and avarice, was confirmed by the most solemn act of religion. Luque celebrated mass, divided a consecrated host into three, and reserving one part to himself, gave the other two to his associates, of which they partook; and thus, in the name of the Prince of Peace, ratified a con∣tract of which plunder and bloodshed were the objects<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. vi. c. 13.

were engaged. Pizarro set sail from Panama with a single vessel, of small burden, and a hundred and twelve men. But in that age, so little were the Spaniards acquainted with the peculiarities of cli∣mate in America,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Nov. 14.</NOTE> that the time which Pizarro chose for his departure was the most improper in the whole year; the periodical winds, which were then set in, being directly adverse to the course which he purposed to steer<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 4. lib. ii. c. 8. Xerez, p. 179.</NOTE>. After beating about for seventy days, with much danger and incessant fatigue, Pizarro's progress towards the south-east was not greater than what a skilful navigator will now make in as many hours. He touched at se∣veral places on the coast of Tierra Firme, but found every where the same uninviting country which former adventures had described; the low grounds converted into swamps by an overflowing of rivers; the higher, covered with impervious woods; few inhabitants, and those fierce and hos∣tile. Famine, fatigue, frequent rencounters with the natives, and above all, the distempers of a moist, sultry climate, combined in wasting his slender band of followers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attended with little success.</NOTE> The undaunted reso∣lution of their leader continued, however, for some time, to sustain their spirits, although no sign had yet appeared of discovering those golden regions to which he had promised to conduct them.

But what he and Pizarro had suffered, gave his countrymen such an unfavourable idea of the service, that it was with difficulty he could levy fourscore men<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. i. c. 1.</NOTE>. Feeble as this reinforcement was, Almagro took the command of it, and having joined Pizarro, they did not he∣sitate about resuming their operations. After a long series of disasters and disappointments, not inferior to those which they had already experienced, part of the armament reached the Bay of St. Matthew, on the coast of Quito, and landed at Tacamez, to the south of the river of Emeraulds, they beheld a country more champaign and fertile than any they had yet discovered in the Southern Ocean, the natives clad in garments of woollen or cotton stuff, and adorned with several trinkets of gold and silver.</P>
<P><PB N="155" REF="034476_0662_0FFDDAEB71628078"/>BUT, notwithstanding those favourable appear∣ances, magnified beyond the truth, both by the vanity of the persons who brought the report from Tacamez, and by the fond imagination of those who listened to them, Pizarro and Almagro durst not venture to invade a country so populous with a handful of men enfeebled by fatigue and diseases. They retired to the small island of Gallo, where Pizarro remained with part of the troops, and his associate returned to Panama, in hopes of bringing such a reinforcement as might enable them to take possession of the opulent territories, whose existence seemed to be no longer doubtful <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Xerez, 181. Herrera, dec. 3. lib. viii. c. 13.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT some of the adventurers, less enterprising,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pizarro re∣called by the gover∣nor of Pa∣nama.</NOTE> or less hardy than their leaders, having secretly conveyed lamentable accounts of their sufferings and losses to their friends at Panama, Almagro met with an unfavourable reception from Pedro de los Rios, who had succeeded Pedradrias in the go∣vernment of that settlement. After weighing the matter with that cold oeconomical prudence which appears the first of all virtues to persons whose li∣mited faculties are incapable of conceiving or exe∣cuting great designs, he concluded an expedition, attended with such certain waste of men, to be so detrimental to an infant and feeble colony, that he not only prohibited the raising of new levies, but dispatched a vessel to bring home Pizarro and his companions from the island of Gallo. Almagro and Luque, though deeply affected with those measures, which they could not prevent, and durst not oppose, found means of communicating their sentiments privately to Pizarro, and exhorted him not to relinquish an enterprise that was the founda∣tion of all their hopes, and the only means of re-establishing their reputation and fortune, which
<PB N="156" REF="034476_0663_0FFDDAED03DCB178"/>
were both on the decline. Pizarro's mind, bent with inflexible obstinacy on all its purposes, needed no incentive to persist in the scheme. He pe∣remptorily refused to obey the governor of Pana∣ma's orders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Persists in his design.</NOTE> and employed all his address and elo∣quence in persuading his men not to abandon him. But the incredible calamities to which they had been exposed were still so recent in their memories, and the thoughts of revisiting their families and friends after a long absence, rushed with such joy into their minds, that when Pizarro drew a line upon the sand with his sword, permitting such as wished to return home to pass over it, only thirteen of all the daring veterans in his service had resolution to remain with their commander.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. x. c. 2, 3.

<P>THIS small, but determined band, whose names the Spanish historians record with deserved praise, as the persons to whose persevering fortitude their country is indebted for the most valuable of all its American possessions, fixed their residence in the island of Gorgona. This, as it was farther remo∣ved from the coast than Galloa, and uninhabited, they considered as a more secure retreat, where, un∣molested, they might wait for supplies from Panama, which they trusted that the activity of their associ∣ates would be able to procure. Almagro and Luque were not inattentive or cold solicitors, and their in∣cessant importunity was seconded by the general voice of the colony, which exclaimed loudly against the infamy of exposing brave men, engaged in the public service, and chargeable with no error but what flowed from an excess of zeal and courage, to perish like the most odious criminals in a desert island. Overcome by those entreaties and ex∣postulations, the governor at last consented to send
<PB N="157" REF="034476_0664_0FFDDAEEC87F5AA0"/>
a small vessel to their relief. But that he might not seem to encourage Pizarro to any new enterprise, he would not permit one landman to embark on board of it.</P>
<P>BY this time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hardships he endured.</NOTE> Pizarro and his companions had remained five months in an island, infamous for the most unhealthy climate in that region of Ame∣rica<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXXI.</NOTE>. During all this period, their eyes were turned towards Panama, in hopes of succour from their countrymen; but worn out at length with fruitless expectations, and dispirited with suffering hardships of which they saw no end, they, in de∣spair, came to a resolution of committing them∣selves to the ocean on a float, rather than continue in that detestable abode. But, on the arrival of the vessel from Panama, they were transported with such joy, that all their sufferings were forgotten. Their hopes revived, and, with a rapid transition, not unnatural among men accustomed by their mode of life to sudden vicissitudes of fortune, high confidence succeeding to extreme dejection, Pizarro easily induced not only his own followers, but the crew of the vessel from Panama, to resume his for∣mer scheme with fresh ardour. Instead of return∣ing to Panama, they stood towards the south-east, and more fortunate in this than in any of their past efforts, they, on the twentieth day after their de∣parture from Gorgona, discovered the coast of Peru.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discovers Peru.</NOTE> After touching at several villages near the shore, which they found to be no wise inviting, they landed at Tumbez, a place of some note, about three degrees south of the line, distinguished for its stately temple, and a palace of the <HI>Incas</HI> or sove∣reigns of the country<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Calancha, p. 103.</NOTE>.

<P>NEITHER the splendid relation that Pizarro gave of the incre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ible opulence of the country which he had discovered, nor his bitter complaints on ac∣count of that unseasonable recal of his forces, which had put it out of his power to attempt making any settlement there, could move the governor of Pa∣nama to swerve from his former plan of conduct. He still contended, that the colony was not in a condition to invade such a mighty empire, and re∣fused to authorise an expedition which he foresaw would be so alluring that it might ruin the province in which he presided, by an effort beyond its strength. His coldness, however, did not in any degree abate the ardour of the three associates; but they per∣ceived that they could not carry their scheme into execution without the countenance of superior au∣thority, and must solicit their sovereign to grant that permission which they could not extort from his de∣legate. With this view, after adjusting among themselves that Pizarro should claim the station of governor, Almagro that of lieutenant-governor, and Luque the dignity of bishop in the coun∣try which they purposed to conquer, they sent Pizarro as their agent to Spain, though their fortunes were now so much exhausted by the repeated efforts which they had made, that they found some difficulty in borrowing the small sum requisite towards equip∣ping him for the voyage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 4. lib. iii. c. 1.

By offering vo∣luntarily to relinquish the office of adelantado, and promising to concur in soliciting that title, with an independent government, for Almagro, he gra∣dually mitigated the rage of an open-hearted sol∣dier, which had been violent, but was not im∣placable. Luque, highly satisfied with having been successful in all his own pretensions, cordially se∣conded Pizarro's endeavours.

What they now experienced corresponded so ill with the alluring description of the country given by Pizarro, that many began to reproach him, and every soldier must have become cold to the service, if even in this unfertile region of Peru, they had not met with some appearances of wealth and cultivation, which seemed to justify the report of their leader. At length they reached the province of Coaque; and,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 14.</NOTE> having surprised the principal settlement of the natives, they seized their vessels and ornaments of gold and silver, to the amount of thirty thousand pesos, with other booty of such value, as dispelled all their doubts, and inspired the most desponding with sanguine hopes<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 4. lib. vii. c. 9. lib. ii. c. 1.

Pizarro hardly met with resistance until he attacked the island of Puna in the bay of Guay∣quil.

<P>AS Pizarro continued to advance towards the center of the Peruvian empire, he gradually re∣ceived more full information concerning its extent and policy, as well as the situation of its affairs at that juncture. Without some knowledge of these, he could not have conducted his operations with propriety; and without a suitable attention to them, it is impossible to account for the progress which the Spaniards had already made, or to un∣fold the causes of their subsequent success.</P>
<P>AT the time when the Spaniards invaded Peru,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the Peruvian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> the dominions of its sovereigns extended in length, from north to south above fifteen hundred mile<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> along the Pacific Ocean. Its breadth, from east to west, was much less considerable; being uni∣formly bounded by the vast ridge of the An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es, stretching from its one extremity to the other. Peru, like the rest of the New World, was origi∣nally possessed by small independent tribes, differ∣ing from each other in manners, and in their forms of rude policy. All, however, were so little civi∣lized, that, if the traditions concerning their mode of life, preserved among their descendants, de∣serve credit, they must be classed among the most unimproved savages of America. Strangers to every species of cultivation or regular industry, without any fixed residence, and unacquainted with those sentiments and obligations which form the first bonds of social union, they are said to have roamed about naked in the forests, with which the country was then covered, more like wild beasts than like men. After they had struggled for se∣veral ages with the hardships and calamities which are inevitable in such a state, and when no circum∣stance seemed to indicate the approach of any un∣common effort towards improvement, we are told
<PB N="166" REF="034476_0673_0FFDDB06A55F9C98"/>
that there appeared on the banks of the lake Ti∣tiaca, a man and woman of majestic form, and clothed in decent garments. They declared them∣selves to be children of the Sun, sent by their be∣neficent parent, who beheld with pity the miseries of the human race, to instruct and to reclaim them. At their persuasion, enforced by reverence for the divinity in whose name they were supposed to speak, several of the dispersed savages united together, and receiving their commands as hea∣venly injunctions, followed them to Cuzco, where they settled, and began to lay the foundations of a city.</P>
<P>MANCO CAPAC and Mama Ocollo, for such were the names of those extraordinary personages, having thus collected some wandering tribes, formed that social union, which, by multiplying the desires, and uniting the efforts of the human species, excites industry, and leads to improve∣ment. Manco Capac instructed the men in agri∣culture, and other useful arts. Mama Ocollo taught the women to spin and to weave. By the labour of the one sex, subsistence became less pre∣carious; by that of the other, life was rendered more comfortable. After securing the objects of first necessity in an infant state, by providing food, raiment, and habitations, for the rude people of whom he took charge, Manco Capac turned his attention towards introducing such laws and policy as might perpetuate their happiness. By his insti∣tutions, which shall be more particularly explained hereafter, the various relations in private life were established, and the duties resulting from them prescribed with such propriety, as gradually formed a barbarous people to decency of manners. In public administration, the functions of persons in authority were so precisely defined, and the subordi∣nation of those under their jurisdiction maintained
<PB N="167" REF="034476_0674_0FFDDB0A58EE2FD8"/>
with such a steady hand, that the society in which he presided, soon assumed the aspect of a regular and well-governed state.</P>
<P>THUS, according to the Indian tradition, was founded the empire of the <HI>Incas</HI> or <HI>Lords</HI> of Peru. At first its extent was small. The territory of Manco Capac did not reach above eight leagues from Cuzco. But within its narrow precincts he exercised absolute and uncontrouled authority. His successors, as their dominions extended, arrogated a similar jurisdiction over the new subjects which they acquired: the despotism of Asia was not more complete. The Incas were not only obeyed as monarchs, but revered as divinities. Their blood was held to be sacred, and, by prohibiting inter∣marriages with the people, was never contaminated by mixing with that of any other race. The family, thus separated from the rest of the nation, was distinguished by peculiarities in dress and ornaments, which it was unlawful for others to assume. The monarch himself appeared with ensigns of royalty reserved for him alone; and received from his sub∣jects marks of obsequious homage and respect, which approached almost to adoration.</P>
<P>BUT, among the Peruvians, this unbounded power of their monarchs seems to have been uni∣formly accompanied with attention to the good of their subjects. It was not the rage of conquest, if we may believe the accounts of their countrymen, that prompted the Incas to extend their dominions, but the desire of diffusing the blessings of civiliza∣tion, and the knowledge of the arts which they possessed, among the barbarous people whom they reduced. During a succession of twelve monarchs, it is said that not one deviated from this beneficent character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cieca de Leon, Chron, c. 44. Herrera, dec. 3. lib. x. c. 4. dec. 5. lib. iii. c. 17.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="168" REF="034476_0675_0FFDDB0CF084BB08"/>WHEN the Spaniards first visited the coast of Peru, in the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-six, Huana Capac, the twelfth monarch from the founder of the state, was seated on the throne. He is represented as a prince distinguished not only for the pacific virtues peculiar to the race, but eminent for his martial talents. By his victo∣rious arms the kingdom of Quito was subjected, a conquest of such extent and importance as almost doubled the power of the Peruvian empire. He was fond of residing in the capital of that valuable province, which he had added to his dominions; and notwithstanding the ancient and fundamental law of the monarchy against polluting the royal blood by any foreign alliance, he married the daughter of the vanquished monarch of Quito.— She bore him a son named Atahualpa, whom, on his death at Quito, which seems to have happened about the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-nine, he appointed his successor in that kingdom, leaving the rest of his dominions to Hu∣ascar, his eldest son, by a mother of the royal race. Greatly as the Peruvians revered the memory of a monarch who had reigned with greater reputation and splendour than any of his predecessors, the de∣stination of Huana Capac concerning the succession, appeared so repugnant to a maxim coeval with the empire, and founded on authority deemed sa∣cred, that it was no sooner known at Cuzco than it excited general disgust. Encouraged by those sen∣timents of his subject, Huascar required his brother to renounce the government of Quito, and to ac∣knowledge him as his lawful superior. But it had been the first care of Atahualpa to gain a large body of troops which had accompanied his father to Quito. These were the flower of the Peruvian warriors, to whose valour Huana Capac had been indebted for all his victories. Relying on their
<PB N="169" REF="034476_0676_0FFDDB0F8FE57928"/>
support, Atahualpa first eluded his brother's de∣mand, and then marched against him in hostile array.</P>
<P>THUS the ambition of two young men, the title of the one founded on ancient usage, and that of the other asserted by the veteran troops, involved Peru in civil war, a calamity to which, under a succession of virtuous princes, it had hitherto been a stranger. In such a contest the issue was obvious. The force of arms triumphed over the authority of laws. Atahualpa remained victorious, and made a cruel use of his victory. Conscious of the defect in his own title to the crown, he attempted to ex∣terminate the royal race, by putting to death all the children of the Sun descended from Manco Ca∣pac, whom he could seize either by force or strata∣gem. From a political motive, the life of his un∣fortunate rival Huascar, who had been taken pri∣soner in a battle which decided the fate of the em∣pire, was prolonged for some time, that, by issuing orders in his name, the usurper might more easily establish his own authority<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. i. c. 15.

<P>WHEN Pizarro landed in the bay of St. Mat∣thew,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Favourable to the pro∣gress of Pi∣zarro.</NOTE> this civil war raged between the two bro∣thers in its greatest fury. Had he made any hostile attempt in his former visit to Peru in the year one thousand five hundred and twenty-seven, he must then have encountered the force of a powerful state, united under a monarch, possessed of capa∣city as well as courage, and unembarrassed with any care that could divert him from opposing his progress. But at this time, the two competitors, though they received early accounts of the arrival and violent proceedings of the Spaniards, were so intent upon the operations of a war, which they
<PB N="170" REF="034476_0677_0FFDDB1230C438F0"/>
deemed more interesting, that they paid no attention to the motions of an enemy, too inconsiderable in number to excite any great alarm, and to whom, it would be easy, as they imagined, to give a check when more at leisure.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He avails himself of it, and ad∣vances.</NOTE>BY this fortunate coincidence of events, whereof Pizarro could have no foresight, and of which, from his defective mode of intercourse with the people of the country, he remained long ignorant, he was permitted to carry on his operations un∣molested, and advanced to the centre of a great empire before one effort of its power was exerted to stop his career. During their progress, the Spa∣niards had acquired some imperfect knowledge of this struggle between the two contending factions. The first complete information with respect to it, they received from the messengers whom Huascar sent to Pizarro, in order to solicit his aid against Atahualpa, whom he represented as a rebel and an usurper<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. ii. c. 3.</NOTE>. Pizarro perceived at once the import∣ance of this intelligence, and foresaw so clearly all the advantages which might be derived from this divided state of the kingdom, which he had in∣vaded, that, without waiting for the reinforcement which he expected from Panama, he determined to push forward, while intestine discord put it out of the power of the Peruvians to attack him with their whole force, and while, by taking part, as circumstances should incline him, with one of the competitors, he might be enabled with greater ease to crush both. Enterprising as the Spaniards of that age were in all their operations against Ame∣ricans, and distinguished as Pizarro was among his countrymen for daring courage, we can hardly sup∣pose, that after having proceeded hitherto slowly, and with much caution, he would have changed at

once his system of operation, and have ventured upon a measure so hazardous, without some new motive or prospect to justify it.</P>
<P>AS he was obliged to divide his troops,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of his forces.</NOTE> in order to leave a garrison in St. Michael, sufficient to de∣fend a station of equal importance as a place of retreat in case of any disaster, and as a port for receiving any supplies which should come from Panama, he began his march with a very slender and ill-accoutred train of followers. They con∣sisted of sixty-two horsemen<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXXII.</NOTE>, and a hundred and two foot-soldiers, of whom twenty were armed with cross-bows, and three with muskets. He di∣rected his course towards Caxamalca, a small town at the distance of twelve days march from St. Michael, where Atahualpa was encamped with a considerable body of troops. Before he had pro∣ceeded far, an officer dispatched by the Inca met him with a valuable present from that prince, accompanied with a proffer of his alliance, and assurances of a friendly reception at Caxamalca. Pizarro, according to the usual artifice of his coun∣trymen in America, pretended to come as the am∣bassador of a very powerful monarch, and declared that he was now advancing with an intention to offer Atahualpa his aid against those enemies who disputed his title to the throne<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. i. c. 3.

<P>AS the object of the Spaniards in entering their country was altogether incomprehensible to the Peruvians,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ideas of the Peruvians concerning their de∣signs.</NOTE> they had formed various conjectures concerning it, without being able to decide whe∣ther they should consider their new guests as beings of a superior nature, who had visited them from some beneficient motive, or as formidable avengers of their crimes, and enemies to their repose and

liberty. The continual professions of the Spa∣niards, that they came to enlighten them with the knowledge of truth, and lead them in the way of happiness, favoured the former opinion; the out∣rages which they committed, their rapaciousness and cruelty, were awful confirmations of the latter. While in this state of uncertainty, Pizarro's decla∣ration of his pacific intentions so far removed all the Inca's fears, that he determined to give him a friendly reception. In consequence of this reso∣lution, the Spaniards were allowed to march in tranquillity across <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sandy desart between St. Michael and Motupe, where the most feeble effort of an enemy, added to the unavoidable distresses which they suffered in passing through that com∣fortless region, must have proved fatal to them<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXXIII.</NOTE>. From Motupè they advanced towards the moun∣tains which encompassed the low country of Peru, and passed through a defile so narrow and inac∣cessible, that a few men might have defended it against a numerous army. But here likewise, from the same inconsiderate credulity of the Inca, the Spaniards met with no opposition, and took quiet possession of a fort erected for the security of that important station. As they now approached near to Caxamalca, Atahualpa renewed his professions of friendship; and as an evidence of their since∣rity, sent them presents of greater value than the former.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrives at Caxamalca.</NOTE>ON entering Caxamalca, Pizarro took possession of a large court, on one side of which was a house which the Spanish historians call a palace of the Inca, and on the other a temple of the Sun, the whole surrounded with a strong rampart or wall of earth. When he had posted his troops in this ad∣vantageous station, he dispatched his brother Fer∣dinand
<PB N="173" REF="034476_0680_0FFDDB1A05BF63C8"/>
and Hernando Soto to the camp of Ata∣hua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pa, which was about a league distant from the town.

They were trea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> with all the respectful hospitality usual among the Peruvians in the reception of their most cordial friends, and Atahualpa promised to visit the Spanish commander next day in his quarters. The decent deportment of the Peruvian monarch, the order of his court, and the reverence with which his subjects approached his person and obeyed his commands, astonished those Spaniards, who had never met in America with any thing more digni∣fied than the petty cazique of a barberous tribe. But their eyes were still more powerfully attracted by the vast profusion of wealth which they observed in the Inca's camp. The rich ornaments worn by him and his attendants, the vessels of gold and sil∣ver in which the repast offered to them was served up, the multitude of utensils of every kind formed of those precious metals, opened prospects far ex∣ceeding any idea of opulence that a European of the sixteenth century could form.</P>

From his own observation of American manners during his long service in the New World, as well as from the advantages which Cortes had derived from seizing Montezuma, he knew of what conse∣quence it was to have the Inca in his power. For this purpose, he formed a plan as daring as it was perfidious. Notwithstanding the character that he

had assumed of an ambassador from a powerful mo∣narch, who courted an alliance with the Inca, and in violation of the repeated offers which he had made to him of his own friendship and assistance, he determined to avail himself of the unsuspicious simplicity with which Atahualpa relied on his pro∣fessions, and to seize the person of the Inca during the interview to which he had invited him. He prepared for the execution of his scheme with the same deliberate arrangement, and with as little compunction, as if it had reflected no disgrace on himself or his country. He divided his cavalry into three small squadrons, under the command of his brother Ferdinand, Soto, and Benalcazar; his infantry were formed in one body, except twenty of most tried courage, whom he kept near his own person to support him in the dangerous service which he reserved for himself; the artillery, con∣sisting of two field-pieces<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Xerez, p. 194.</NOTE> and the cross-bowmen, were placed opposite to the avenue by which Ata∣hualpa was to approach.

Even then, lest the order of the procession should be de∣ranged, he moved so slowly, that the Spaniards became impatient, and apprehensive that some sus∣picion of their intention might be the cause of this delay. In order to remove this, Pizarro dispatched one of his officers with fresh assurances of his friendly disposition. At length the Inca approach∣ed.

Some parts in it, of more obvious meaning, filled him with astonishment and indignation. His reply, however, was temperate. He began with observ∣ing, that he was lord of the dominions over which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e reigned by hereditary succession; and added, that he could not conceive how a foreign priest should pretend to dispose of territories which did not belong to him; that if such a preposterous grant had been made, he, who was the rightful possessor, refused to confirm it; that he had no in∣clination to renounce the religious institutions esta∣blished by his ancestors; nor would he forsake the service of the Sun, the immortal divinity whom he and his people revered, in order to worship the God of the Spaniards, who was subject to death, that with respect to other matters contained in his discourse, as he had never heard of them before, he did not now understand their meaning, he de∣sired to know where the priest had learned things so extraordinary. "In this book," answered Val∣verde, reaching out to him his breviary. The Inca opened it eagerly, and turning over the leaves, lifted it to his ear: "This," says he, "is silent; it tells me nothing;" and threw it with disdain to the ground.

Pizarro, afraid of losing all the ad∣vantages which he hoped to derive from the pos∣session of such a prisoner, laboured to console him with professions of kindness and respect, that cor∣responded ill with his actions. By residing among the Spaniards, the Inca quickly discovered their ruling passion, which, indeed, they were no-wise, solicitous to conceal, and by applying to that, made an attempt to recover his liberty.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> He offered as a ransom what astonished the Spaniards, even after all they now knew concerning the opulence of his kingdom. The apartment in which he was con∣fined was twenty-two feet in length and sixteen in breadth; he undertook to fill it with vessels of gold as high as he could reach. Pizarro closed eagerly with this tempting proposal, and a line was drawn upon the walls of the chamber, to mark the stipulated height to which the treasure was to rise.</P>
<P>ATAHUALPA, transported with having obtained some prospect of liberty, took measures instantly for fulfilling his part of the agreement, by sending messengers to Cuzco, Quito, and other places, where gold had been amassed in largest quantities, either for adorning the temples of the gods, or the houses of the Inca, to bring what was necessary for completing his ransom directly to Caxamalca. Though Atahualpa was now in the custody of his enemies, yet so much were the Peruvians accus∣tomed to respect every mandate issued by their so∣vereign,

that his orders were executed with the greatest alacrity. Soothed with hopes of recover∣ing his liberty by this means, the subjects of the Inca were afraid of endangering his life by forming any other scheme for his relief; and though the force of the empire was still entire, no preparations were made, and no army assembled to avenge their own wrongs or those of their monarch<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Xerez, 205.</NOTE>.

beyond that which Atahualpa had engaged to pay for his ransom. If the Spaniards should listen to this proposal, Atahualpa perceived his own destruc∣tion to be inevitable; and suspecting that their in∣satiable thirst for gold would tempt them to lend a favourable ear to it, he determined to sacrifice his brother's life, that he might save his own; and his orders for this purpose were executed, like all his other commands, with scrupulous punctuality<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. ii. c. 6.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Spani∣ards make a division of the spoil.</NOTE>MEANWHILE, Indians daily arrived at Caxa∣malca from different parts of the kingdom, loaded with treasure. A great part of the stipulated quan∣tity was now amassed, and Atahualpa assured the Spaniards, that the only thing which prevented the whole from being brought in, was the remote∣ness of the provinces where it was deposited. But such vast piles of gold presented continually to the view of needy soldiers, had so inflamed their ava∣rice, that it was impossible any longer to restrain their impatience to obtain possession of this rich booty. Orders were given for melting down the whole, except some pieces of curious fabric, re∣served as a present for the emperor. After setting apart the fifth due to the crown, and a hundred thousand pesos as a donative to the soldiers which arrived with Almagro, there remained one million five hundred and twenty-eight thousand five hun∣dred pesos to Pizarro and his followers.

In this division above eight thousand pesos, at that time not inferior in effective value to as many pounds sterling in the present century, fell to the share of each horseman, and half that sum to each foot soldier.

Pizarro, sensible that from such men he could expect neither enterprise in ac∣tion nor fortitude in suffering, and persuaded that wherever they went, the display of their riches would allure adventurers, less opulent but more hardy, to his standard, granted their suit without reluctance, and permitted above sixty of them to accompany his brother Ferdinand, whom he sent to Spain with an account of his success, and the present destined for the emperor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. iii. c. 4.

thoughts. During his long service in the New World, he had imbibed those ideas and maxims of his fellow-soldiers, which led them to consider its inhabitants as an inferior race, neither worthy of the name, nor entitled to the rights, of men. In his compact with Atahualpa, he had no other ob∣ject than to amuse his captive with such a prospect of recovering his liberty, as might induce him to lend all the aid of his authority towards collecting the wealth of his kingdom. Having now accom∣plished this, he no longer regarded his plighted faith; and at the very time when the credulous prince hoped to be replaced on his throne, he had secretly resolved to bereave him of life. Many circumstances seem to have concurred in prompting him to this action, the most criminal and atrocious that stains the Spanish name, amidst all the deeds of violence committed in carrying on the conquest of the New World.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">He and the Spaniards mutually jealous.</NOTE>THOUGH Pizarro had seized the Inca, in imita∣tion of Cortes's conduct towards the Mexican mo∣narch, he did not possess talents for carrying on the same artful plan of policy.

Atahualpa was, indeed, a prince of greater abilities and dis∣cernment than Montezuma, and seems to have pe∣netrated more thoroughly into the character and intentions of the Spaniards. Mutual suspicion and distrust accordingly took place between them. The strict attention with which it was necessary to guard a captive of such importance, greatly increased the fatigue of military duty. The utility of keeping him appeared inconsiderable; and Pizarro felt him as an incumbrance, from which he wished to be delivered<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. iii. c. 4.</NOTE>.</P>

They were apprehensive, that as long as Atahualpa remained a prisoner, Pizarro's soldiers would apply whatever treasure should be acquired, to make up what was wanting of the quantity stipulated for his ransom, and under that pretext exclude them from any part of it. They insisted eagerly on putting the Inca to death, that all the adventurers in Peru might thereafter be on an equal footing<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. ii. c. 7. Vega, P. 2. lib. i. c. 7.

These fears and suspicions were artfully increased by Philippillo, one of the Indians whom Pizarro had carried off from Tumbez in the year one thousand five hun∣dred and twenty-seven, and whom he employed as an interpreter. The function which he performed admitting this man to familiar intercourse with the captive monarch, he presumed, notwithstanding the meanness of his birth, to raise his affections to a <HI>Coya,</HI> or descendent of the Sun, one of Atahualpa's wives; and seeing no prospect of gratifying that passion during the life of the monarch, he endea∣voured to fill the ears of the Spaniards with such accounts of the Inca's secret designs and prepara∣tions, as might awaken their jealousy, and incite them to cut him off.</P>

<PB N="184" REF="034476_0691_0FFDDB37438C2C30"/>
to ruin him by private machinations, that unhappy prince inadvertently contributed to hasten his own fate. During his confinement he had at∣tached himself with peculiar affection to Ferdinand Pizarro and Hernando Soto; who, as they were persons of birth and education superior to the rough adventurers with whom they served, were accus∣tomed to behave with more decency and attention to the captive monarch. Soothed with this respect from persons of such high rank, he delighted in their society. But in the presence of the governor he was always uneasy and overawed. This dread soon came to be mingled with contempt. Among all the European arts, what he admired most was that of reading and writing; and he long delibera∣ted with himself, whether he should regard it as a natural or acquired talent. In order to determine this, he desired one of the soldiers, who guarded him, to write the name of God on the nail of his thumb. This he shewed successively to several Spaniards, asking its meaning; and to his amaze∣ment, they all, without hesitation, returned the same answer. At length Pizarro entered; and on presenting it to him, he blushed, and with some confusion was obliged to acknowledge his igno∣rance. From that moment, Atahualpa considered him as a mean person, less instructed than his own soldiers; and he had not address enough to conceal the sentiments with which this discovery inspired him. To be the object of a barbarian's scorn, not only mortified the pride of Pizarro, but excited such resentment in his breast, as added force to all the other considerations which promped him to put the Inca to death<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. iii. c. 4.

exempted from standing singly responsible for the commission of it, Pizarro, resolved to try the Inca with all the formalities observed in the criminal courts of Spain. Pizarro himself, and Almagro, with two assistants, were appointed judges, with full power to acquit or to condemn; an attorney-general was named to carry on the prosecution in the king's name; counsellors were chosen to assist the prisoner in his defence; and clerks were or∣dained to record the proceedings of court. Before this strange tribunal, a charge was exhibited still more amazing. It consisted of various articles; that Atahualpa, though a bastard, had dispossessed the rightful owner of the throne, and usurped the regal power; that he had put his brother and law∣ful sovereign to death; that he was an idolater, and had not only permitted, but commanded the offer∣ing of human sacrifices; that he had a great num∣ber of concubines; that since his imprisonment he had wasted and embezzled the royal treasures, which now belonged of right to the conquerors; that he had incited his subjects to take arms against the Spaniards. On these heads of accusation, some of which are so ludicrous, others so absurd, that the effrontery of Pizarro, in making them the foun∣dation of a serious procedure, is not less surpri∣sing than his injustice, did this strange court go on to try the sovereign of a great empire, over whom it had no jurisdiction. With respect to each of the articles, witnesses were examined; but as they de∣livered their evidence in their native tongue, Phi∣lippillo had it in his power to give their words whatever turn best suited his malevolent intentions. To judges predetermined in their opinion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He is con∣demned,</NOTE> this evidence appeared sufficient. They pronounced Atahualpa guilty, and condemned him to be burnt alive. Friar Valverde prostituted the authority of his sacred function to confirm this sentence, and by
<PB N="186" REF="034476_0693_0FFDDB3B89857830"/>
his signature warranted it to be just. Astonished at his fate, Atahualpa endeavoured to avert it by tears, by promises, and by entreaties, that he might be sent to Spain, where a monarch would be the ar∣biter of his lot. But pity never touched the un∣feeling heart of Pizarro. He ordered him to be led instantly to execution; and, what added to the bitterness of his last moments, the same monk who had just ratified his doom, offered to console, and attempted to convert him. The most powerful argument Valverde employed to prevail with him to embrace the Christian faith, was a promise of mitigation in his punishment.

In consequence of this state of things, ambitious men in different parts of the empire aspired to in∣dependent authority, and usurped jurisdiction to which they had no title.

he resolved to invade it. The high reputa∣tion of the commander allured volunteers from every quarter. He embarked with five hundred men, of whom above two hundred were of such distinction as to serve on horseback. He landed at Puerto Viejo, and without sufficient knowledge of the country, or proper guides to conduct him, attempted to march directly to Quito, by follow∣ing the course of the river Guayquil, and crossing the ridge of the Andes towards its head. But in this route, one of the most impracticable in all America, his troops endured such fatigue in forcing their way through forests and marshes on the low grounds, and suffered so much from excessive cold when they began to ascend the mountains, that before they reached the plain of Quito, a fifth part of the men and half of their horses died, and the rest were so much dispirited and worn out, as to be almost unfit for service.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XXXVIII.</NOTE> There they met with a body, not of Indians but of Spaniards, drawn up in hostile array against them. Pizarro having re∣ceived an account of Alvarado's armament, had detached Almagro with some troops to oppose this formidable invader of his jurisdiction; and these were joined by Benalcazar and his victorious party. Alvarado, though surprised at the sight of enemies whom he did not expect, advanced boldly to the charge. But, by the interposition of some moderate men in each party, an amicable accommodation took place; and the fatal period, when Spaniards suspended their conquests to em∣brue their hands in the blood of their countrymen, was postponed a few years. Alvarado engaged to return to his government, upon Almagro's paying him a hundred thousand pesos to defray the expence of his armament. Most of his followers remained

of an independent government, than, pretending that Cuzco, the imperial residence of the Incas, lay within its boundaries, he attempted to render himself master of that important station. Juan and Gonzalez Pizarro prepared to oppose him. Each of the contending parties was supported by powerful adherents, and the dispute was on the point of being terminated by the sword, when Francis Pizarro arrived in the capital. The recon∣ciliation between him and Almagro had never been cordial. The treachery of Pizarro in engrossing to himself all the honours and emoluments, which ought to have been divided with his associate, was always present in both their thoughts. The former, conscious of his own perfidy, did not expect for∣giveness; the latter, feeling that he had been de∣ceived, was impatient to be avenged; and though avarice and ambition had induced them not only to dissemble their sentiments, but even to act in concert while in pursuit of wealth and power, no sooner did they obtain possession of these, than the same passions which had formed this temporary union, gave rise to jealousy and discord. To each of them was attached a small band of interested dependents, who, with the malicious art peculiar to such men, heightened their suspicions, and mag∣nified every appearance of offence. But with all those seeds of enmity in their minds, and thus assiduously cherished, each was so thoroughly ac∣quainted with the abilities and courage of his rival, that they equally dreaded the consequences of an open rupture. The fortunate arrival of Pizarro at Cuzco, and the address mingled with firmness which he manifested in his expostulations with Almagro and his partizans, averted that evil for the present. A new reconciliation took place; the chief article of which was, that Almagro should attempt the conquest of Chili; and if he did not

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Regulati∣ons of Pi∣zarro.</NOTE>SOON after he concluded this important trans∣action, Pizarro marched back to the countries on the sea-coast, and as he now enjoyed an interval of tranquillity, undisturbed by any enemy, either Spanish or Indian, he applied himself with that persevering ardour, which distinguishes his cha∣racter, to introduce a form of regular government into the extensive provinces subject to his autho∣rity. Though ill qualified by his education to enter into any disquisition concerning the principles of civil policy, and little accustomed by his former habits of life to attend to its arrangements, his natural sagacity supplied the want both of science and experience. He distributed the country into various districts; he appointed proper magistrates to preside in each; and established regulations con∣cerning the administration of justice, the collection of the royal revenue, the working of the mines, and the treatment of the Indians, extremely simple, but well calculated to promote the public prospe∣rity. But, though, for the present, he adapted his plan to the infant state of the colony, his aspiring mind looked forward to its future grandeur. He considered himself as laying the foundation of a great empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Foundation of Lima.</NOTE> and deliberated long, and with much solicitude, in what place he should fix the seat of government. Cuzco, the imperial city of the Incas, was situated in a corner of the empire, above four hundred miles from the sea, and much farther from Quito, a province of whose value he had
<PB N="195" REF="034476_0702_0FFDC54C62FC7F48"/>
formed an high idea. No other settlement of the Peruvians was so considerable as to merit the name of a town, or to allure the Spaniards to fix their residence in it. But, in marching through the country, Pizarro had been struck with the beauty and fertility of the valley of Rimac, one of the most extensive and best cultivated in Peru. There, on the banks of a small river, of the same name with the vale which it waters and enriches, at the distance of six miles from Callao, the most com∣modious harbour in the Pacific Ocean, he founded a city which he destined to be the capital of his government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1535. January 18.</NOTE> He gave it the name of Ciudad de los Reyes, either from the circumstance of having laid the first stone, at that season when the church celebrates the festival of the Three Kings, or, as is more probable, in honour of Juana and Charles, the joint sovereigns of Castile. This name it still retains among the Spaniards, in all legal and formal deeds; but it is better known to foreigners by that of <HI>Lima,</HI> a corruption of the ancient appellation of the valley in which it is situated.

Peru. From impatience to finish the expedition, or from that contempt of hardship and danger acquired by all the Spaniards who had served long in America, Almagro, instead of advancing along the level country on the coast, chose to march across the mountains by a route that was shorter indeed, but almost impracticable. In this attempt his troops were exposed to every calamity which men can suffer, from fatigue, from famine, and from the rigour of the climate in those elevated regions of the torrid zone, where the degree of cold is hardly inferior to what is felt within the polar circle. Many of them perished; and the survivors, when they descended into the fertile plains of Chili, had new difficulties to encounter. They found there a race of men very different from the people of Peru, intrepid, hardy, independent, and in their bodily constitution, as well as vigour of spirit, nearly resembling the warlike tribes in North America. Though filled with wonder at the first appearance of the Spaniards, and still more astonished at the operations of their cavalry and the effects of their fire-arms, the Chilese soon recovered so far from their surprize, as not only to defend themselves with obstinacy, but to attack their new enemies with more determined fierceness than any American nation had hitherto discovered. The Spaniards, however, continued to penetrate into the country, and collected some considerable quantities of gold; but were so far from thinking of making any settlement amidst such formidable neighbours, that, in spite of all the experience and valour of their leader, the final issue of the expedition still remained extremely dubious, when they were recalled from it by an unexpected revolution in Peru<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib iii. c. 1.

Though strictly watched by the Spaniards, who allowed him to reside in the palace of his ancestors at Cuzco, he found means of communicating his scheme to the persons who were to be entrusted with the execution of it. Among people accus∣tomed to revere their sovereign as a divinity, every hint of his will carries the authority of a command; and they themselves were now con∣vinced, by the daily increase in the number of their invaders, that the fond hopes which they had long entertained of their voluntary departure were altogether vain. All perceived that a vi∣gorous

Under pretext of that solemnity, the great men of the empire were assembled. As soon as the Inca joined them, the standard of war was erected; and in a short time all the fighting men, from the confines of Quito to the frontier of Chili, were in arms. Many Spaniards, living securely on the settlements allotted them, were massacred. Several detachments, as they marched carelessly through a country which seemed to be tamely sub∣missive to their dominion, were cut off to a man. An army amounting (if we may believe the Spa∣nish writers) to two hundred thousand men, at∣tacked Cuzco, which the three brothers endea∣voured to defend with only one hundred and seventy Spaniards. Another formidable body in∣vested Lima, and kept the governor closely shut up. There was no longer any communication be∣tween the two cities; the numerous forces of the Peruvians spreading over the country, intercepted every messenger; and as the parties in Cuzco and Lima were equally unacquainted with the fate of their countrymen, each boded the worst concerning the other, and imagined that they themselves were the only persons who had survived the general extinction of the Spanish name in Peru<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vega, p. 11. lib. ii. c. 28.

They not only observed the advantages which the Spaniards de∣rived from their discipline and their weapons, but they endeavoured to imitate the former, and turn the latter against them. They armed a considera∣ble body of their bravest warriors with the swords, the spears, and bucklers, which they had taken from the Spanish soldiers whom they had cut off in different parts of the country. These they endea∣voured to marshal in that regular compact order, to which experience had taught them that the Spa∣niards were indebted for their irresistible force in action. Some appeared in the field with Spanish muskets, and had acquired skill and resolution enouqh to use them. A few of the boldest, among whom was the Inca himself, were mounted on the horses which they had taken, and advanced briskly to the charge like Spanish cavaliers, with their lances in the rest.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Arrival of Almagro, and motives of his con¦duct.</NOTE>THE accounts transmitted to Almagro concern∣ing the general insurrection of the Peruvians, were such as would have induced him, without hesita∣tion, to relinquish the conquest of Chili, and hasten to the aid of his countrymen. But in this resolution he was confirmed by a motive less gene∣rous, but more interesting. By the same messen∣ger who brought him intelligence of the Inca's revolt, he received the royal patent creating him governor of Chili, and defining the limits of his jurisdiction. Upon considering the tenor of it, he deemed it manifest beyond contradiction, that Cuzco lay within the boundaries of his govern∣ment, and he was equally solicitous to prevent the Peruvians from recovering possession of their capi∣tal, and to wrest it out of the hands of the Pizarros. From impatience to accomplish both, he ventured to return by a new route; and in marching through the sandy plains on the coast, he suffered, from heat and drought, calamities of a new species, hardly inferior to those in which he had been in∣volved by cold and famine on the summits of the Andes.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="034476_0708_0FFDC558D1946D60"/>HIS arrival at Cuzco was in a critical moment. The Spaniards and Peruvians fixed their eyes upon him with equal solicitude. The former,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1537. His opera∣tions.</NOTE> as he did not study to conceal his pretensions, were at a loss whether to welcome him as a deliverer, or to take precautions against him as an enemy. The latter, knowing the points in contest between him and his countrymen, flattered themselves that they had more to hope than to dread from his opera∣tions. Almagro himself, unacquainted with the detail of the events which had happened in his absence, and solicitous to learn the precise posture or affairs, advanced towards the capital slowly, and with great circumspection. Various negocia∣tions with both parties were set on foot. The Inca conducted them on his part with much ad∣dress. At first he endeavoured to gain the friend∣ship of Almagro; and after many fruitless over∣tures, dispairing of any cordial union with a Spa∣niard, he attacked him by surprise with a nume∣rous body of chosen troops. But the Spanish disci∣pline and valour maintained their wonted superiority. The Peruvians were repulsed with such slaughter, that a great part of their army dispersed, and Al∣magro proceeded to the gates of Cuzco without in∣terruption.</P>
<P>THE Pizarros,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Takes pos∣session of Cuzco.</NOTE> as they had no longer to make head against the Peruvians, directed all their at∣tention towards their new enemy, and took mea∣sures to obstruct his entry into the capital. Pru∣dence, however, restrained both parties for some time from turning their arms against one another while surrounded by common enemies, who would rejoice in the mutual slaughter. Different schemes of accommodation were proposed. Each endea∣voured to deceive the other, or to corrupt his followers. The generous, open, affable temper of Almagro gained many adherents of the Pizarros,
<PB N="202" REF="034476_0709_0FFDDB61EF31AA40"/>
who were disgusted with their harsh domineering manners. Encouraged by this defection, he ad∣vanced towards the city by night, surprised the centinels, or was admitted by them, and investing the house where the two brothers resided, com∣pelled them, after an obstinate defence, to sur∣render at discretion.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Civil war, and first success of Almagro,</NOTE>TWO or three persons only were killed in this first act of civil hostility; but it was soon followed by scenes more bloody.

This body, which, at that period of the Spanish power in America, must be deemed a considerable force, advanced near to the capital before they knew that they had any enemy more formidable than Indians to encounter. It was with astonishment that they beheld their countrymen posted on the banks of the river Aban∣cay to oppose their progress. Almagro, however, wished rather to gain than to conquer them, and by bribes and promises endeavoured to seduce their leader. The fidelity of Alvarado remained un∣shaken; but his talents for war were not equal to his virtue.

<P>BY the sudden rout of this body,<NOTE PLACE="marg">but does not improve hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> advantages.</NOTE> the contest between the two rivals must have been decided, if Almagro had known as well how to improve as how to gain a victory. Rodrigo Orgognez, an officer of great abilities, who having served under the constable Bourbon, when he led the Imperial army to Rome, had been accustomed to bold and decisive measures, advised him instantly to issue orders for putting to death Ferdinand and Gon∣zalo Pizarros, Alvarado, and a few other persons whom he could not hope to gain, and to march directly with his victorious troops to Lima, before the governor had time to prepare for his defence. But Almagro, though he discerned at once the utility of the counsel, and though he had courage to have carried it into execution, suffered himself to be influenced by sentiments unlike those of a soldier of fortune grown old in service, and by scruples which suited not the chief of a party who had drawn his sword in civil war. Feelings of huma∣nity restrained him from shedding the blood of his opponents; and the dread of being deemed a rebel, deterred him from entering a province which the king had allotted to another. Though he knew that arms must terminate the dispute between him and Pizarro, and resolved not to shun that mode of decision, yet, with a timid delicacy preposterous at such a juncture, he was so solicitous that his rival should be considered as the aggressor, that he marched quietly back to Cuzco, to wait his ap∣proach<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 6. lib. ii. c. 10, 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="034476_0711_0FFDDB662BBFF380"/>PIZARRO was still unacquainted with all the in∣teresting events which had happened near Cuzco. Accounts of Almagro's return, of the loss of the capital,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distress of Pizarro.</NOTE> of the death of one brother, of the impri∣sonment of the other two, and of the defeat of Alvarado, were brought to him at once. Such a tide of misfortunes almost overwhelmed a spirit which had continued firm and erect under the rudest shocks of adversity. But the necessity of attending to his own safety, as well as the desire of revenge, preserved him from sinking under it. He took measures for both with his wonted saga∣city.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His artful conduct.</NOTE>
As he he had the command of the sea-coast, and expected considerable supplies both of men and military stores, it was no less his interest to gain time, and to avoid action, than it was that of Almagro to precipitate operations, and bring the contest to a speedy issue. He had recourse to arts which he had formerly practised with success, and Almagro was again weak enough to suffer himself to be amused with a prospect of terminating their differences by some amicable accommodation. By varying his overtures, and shifting his ground as often as it suited his purpose, sometimes seeming to yield every thing which his rival could desire, and then retracting all that he had granted, Pizarro dexterously protracted the negociation to such a length, that though every day was precious to Almagro, several months elapsed without coming to any final agreement. While the attention of Almagro, and of the officers with whom he con∣sulted, was occupied in detecting and eluding the fraudulent intentions of the governor, Gonzalo Pizarro and Alvarado found means to corrupt the soldiers to whose custody they were committed, and not only made their escape themselves, but persuaded sixty of the men who formerly guarded

Fortune having thus delivered one of his brothers, the governor scrupled not at one act of perfidy more to procure the release of the other. He proposed, that every point in controversy between Almagro and himself should be submitted to the decision of their sove∣reign; that until his award was known, each should retain undisturbed possession of whatever part of the country he now occupied; that Ferdi∣nand Pizarro should be set at liberty, and return instantly to Spain, together with the officers, whom Almagro purposed to send thither to represent the justice of his claims. Obvious as the design of Pi∣zarro was in those propositions, and familiar as his artifices might now have been to his opponent, Al∣magro with a credulity approaching to infatuation, relied on his sincerity, and concluded an agreement on these terms<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 6. lib. iii. c. 9.

<P>THE moment that Ferdinand Pizarro recovered his liberty, the governor,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His prepa∣rations for war.</NOTE> no longer fettered in his operations by anxiety about his brother's life, threw off every disguise which his concern for it had obliged him to assume. The treaty was forgotten; pacific and conciliating measures were no more mentioned; it was in the field he openly declared, and not in the cabinet; by arms, and not by ne∣gociation; that it must now be determined who should be master of Peru. The rapidity of his preparations suited such a decisive resolution. Seven hundred men were soon ready to march towards Cuzco.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1538.</NOTE> The command of these was given to his two brothers, in whom he could perfectly confide for the execution of his most violent schemes, as they were urged on, not only by the enmity flow∣ing

from the rivalship between their family and Almagro, but animated with the desire of venge∣ance, excited by recollection of their own recent disgrace and sufferings. After an unsuccessful at∣tempt to cross the mountains in the direct road be∣tween Lima and Cuzco, they marched towards the south along the coast as far as Nasca, and then turning to the left, penetrated through the defiles in that branch of the Andes which lay between them and the capital. Almagro, instead of hearken∣ing to some of his officers, who advised him to at∣tempt the defence of those difficult passes, waited the approach of the enemy in the plain of Cuzco. Two reasons seem to have induced him to take this resolution. His followers amounted hardly to five hundred, and he was afraid of weakening such a feeble body by sending any detachment towards the mountains. His cavalry far exceeded that of the adverse party, both in number and discipline, and it was only in an open country that he could avail himself of that advantage.</P>

Unfortunately for the victorious faction, the first intelligence was brought thither by some or Almagro's officers, who left the coun∣try upon the ruin of their cause; and they related what had happened, with every circumstance un∣favourable to Pizarro and his brothers. Their ambition, their breach of the most solemn engage∣ments, their violence and cruelty, were painted with all the malignity and exaggeration of party hatred. Ferdinand Pizarro, who arrived soon af∣ter, and appeared in court with extraordinary splen∣dour, endeavoured to efface the impression which their accusations had made, and to justify his bro∣ther and himself by representing Almagro as the aggressor. The emperor and his ministers, though
<PB N="211" REF="034476_0718_0FFDDB78A151C130"/>
they could not pronounce which of the contending factions was most criminal, clearly discerned the fatal tendency of their dissentions. It was obvious, that while the leader, entrusted with the conduct of two infant colonies, employed the arms which should have been turned against the common ene∣my, in destroying one another, all attention to the public good must cease, and there was reason to dread that the Indians might improve the advan∣tage which the disunion of the Spaniards presented to them, and extirpate both the victors and van∣quished. But the evil was more apparent than the remedy. Where the information which had been received was so defective and suspicious, and the scene of action so remote, it was almost impossible to chalk out the line of conduct that ought to be followed; and before any plan that should be ap∣proved of in Spain could be carried into execution, the situation of the parties, and the circumstances of affairs, might alter so entirely as to render its effects extremely pernicious.</P>

The man selected for this important charge was Christoval Vaca de Castro, a judge in the court of royal audience at Valladolid; and his abilities, integrity, and firmness, justified the choice. His instructions, though ample, were not such as to fetter him in his operations. According to the different aspect of affairs, he had power to take upon him different characters. If he found the

But if Pizarro were dead, he was entrusted with a commission that he might then produce, by which he was appointed his suc∣cessor in the government of Peru. This attention to Pizarro, however, seems to have flowed rather from dread of his power, than from any approba∣tion of his measures; for at the very time that the court seemed so solicitous not to irritate him, his brother Ferdinand was arrested at Madrid, and con∣fined to a prison, where he remained above twenty years <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gomara Hist. c. 142.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pizarro di∣vides Peru among his followers.</NOTE>WHILE Vaca de Castro was preparing for his voyage, events of great moment happened in Peru. The governor, considering himself, upon the death of Almagro, as the unrivalled possessor of that vast empire, proceeded to parcel out its territories among the conquerors; and had this division been made with any degree of impartiality, the extent of country which he had to bestow, was sufficient to have gratified his friends, and to have gained his enemies. But Pizarro conducted this transac∣tion, not with the equity and candour of a judge attentive to discover and to reward merit, but with the illiberal spirit of a party leader. Large districts, in parts of the country most cultivated and populous, were set apart as his own property, or granted to his brother, his adherents and favourites. To others, lots less valuable and inviting were as∣signed. The followers of Almagro, amongst whom were many of the original adventurers to whose valour and perseverance Pizarro was indebted for

Pedro de Valdivia reassumed Almagro's scheme of invading Chili, and notwithstanding the fortitude of the natives in defending their possessions, made such progress in the conquest of the country, that he founded the city of St. Jago, and gave a beginning to the esta∣blishment of the Spanish dominion in that pro∣vince<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. iii. c. 13.

to have resolved that no person in Peru should pos∣sess any station of distinguished eminence or autho∣rity but those of his own family, had deprived Be∣nalcazar, the conqueror of Quito, of his com∣mand in that kingdom, and appointed his brother Gonzalo to take the government of it.

Gonzalo, not inferior to any of his brothers in courage, and no less ambitious of acquiring dis∣tinction, eagerly engaged in this difficult service. He set out from Quito at the head of three hun∣dred and forty soldiers, near one half of whom were horsemen, with four thousand Indians to carry their provisions. In forcing their way through the defiles, or over the ridges of the Andes, ex∣cess of cold and fatigue, to neither of which they were accustomed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Hardships they en∣dure.</NOTE> proved fatal to the greater part of their wretched attendants.

They could not advance a step but as they cut a road through woods, or made it through marshes. Such incessant toil, and continual scarcity of food, seem more than sufficient to have exhausted and dispirited
<PB N="215" REF="034476_0722_0FFDDB84B3088B70"/>
any troops. But the fortitude and perseverance of the Spaniards in the sixteenth century were insu∣perable. Allured by frequent but false accounts of rich countries before them, they persisted in strug∣gling on, until they reached the banks of the Coca or Napo, one of the large rivers whose waters pour into the Maragnon, and contribute to its grandeur. There, with infinite labour, they built a bark, which they expected would prove of great utility, in conveying them over rivers, in procuring provisions, and in exploring the country. This was manned with fifty soldiers, under the command of Francis Orellana, the officer next in rank to Pizarro. The stream carried them down with such rapidity, that they were soon far a-head of their countrymen, who followed slowly and with difficulty by land.</P>
<P>AT this distance from his commander, Orellana,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Deserted by Orellana.</NOTE> a young man of an aspiring mind, began to fancy himself independent, and transported with the pre∣dominant passion of the age, he formed the scheme of distinguishing himself as a discoverer, by fol∣lowing the course of the Maragnon, until it joined the ocean, and by surveying the vast regions through which it slows. This scheme of Orel∣lana's was as bold as it was treacherous. For, if he be chargeable with the guilt of having violated his duty to his commander, and with having aban∣doned his fellow-soldiers in a pathless desert, where they had hardly any hopes of success, or even of safety, but what were founded on the service which they expected from the bark; his crime is, in some measure, balanced by the glory of having ventured upon a navigation of near two thousand leagues, through unknown nations, in a vessel hastily con∣structed with green timber, and by very unskilful hands, without provisions, without a compass, or
<PB N="216" REF="034476_0723_0FFDDB864F151580"/>
a pilot. But his courage and alacrity supplied every defect. Committing himself fearlessly to the guidance of the stream, the Napo bore him along to the south,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sails down the Marag∣non.</NOTE> until he reached the great channel of the Maragnon. Turning with it towards the coast, he held on his course in that direction. He made frequent descents on both sides of the river, some∣times seizing by force of arms the provisions of the fierce savages seated on its banks; and sometimes procuring a supply of food by a friendly intercourse with more gentle tribes. After a long series of dangers which he encountered with amazing for∣titude, and of distresses which he supported with no less magnanimity, he reached the ocean <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLI.</NOTE>, where new perils awaited him. These he likewise sur∣mounted, and got safe to the Spanish settlement in the island Cubagua; from thence he sailed to Spain. The vanity natural to travellers who visit regions unknown to the rest of mankind, and the art of an adventurer, solicitous to magnify his own merit, concurred in prompting him to mingle an extra∣ordinary proportion of the marvellous in the narra∣tive of his voyage. He pretended to have disco∣vered nations so rich, that the roofs of their temples were covered with plates of gold; and de∣scribed a republic of women so warlike and power∣ful, as to have extended their dominion over a con∣siderable tract of the fertile plains which he had visited. Extravagant as those tales were, they gave rise to an opinion, that a region abounding with gold, distinguished by the name of <HI>El Dorado,</HI> and a community of Amazons, were to be found in this part of the New World; and such is the pro∣pensity of mankind to believe what is wonderful, that it has been slowly and with difficulty that rea∣son

and observation have exploded those fables.

<P>NO words can describe the consternation of Pi∣zarro,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Distress of Pizarro.</NOTE> when he did not find the bark at the con∣fluence of the Napo and Maragnon, where he had ordered Orellana to wait for him. He would not allow himself to suspect that a man, whom he had intrusted with such an important command, could be so base and so unfeeling, as to desert him at such a juncture. But imputing his absence from the place of rendezvous to some unknown accident, he advanced above fifty leagues along the banks of the Maragnon, expecting every moment to see the bark appear with a supply of provisions.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1541.</NOTE> At length he came up with an officer whom Orellana had left to perish in the desert, because he had the courage to remonstrate against his perfidy.

The spirit of the stoutest hearted veteran sunk with∣in him, and all demanded to be led back instantly. Pizarro, though he assumed an appearance of tran∣quillity, did not oppose their inclination. But he was now twelve hundred miles from Quito; and in that long march the Spaniards encountered hard∣ships greater than those which they had endured in

Hunger compelled them to feed on roots and berries, to eat all their dogs and horses, to devour the most loathsome reptiles, and even to gnaw the leather of their faddles and sword-belts. Four thousand Indians, and two hundred and ten Spaniards, perished in this wild disastrous ex∣pedition, which continued near two years; and as fifty men were aboard the bark with Orellana, only fourscore got back to Quito.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Number of malcon∣tents in Peru.</NOTE>BUT, instead of returning to enjoy the repose which his condition required, Pizarro, on entering Quito, received accounts of a fatal event that threatened calamities more dreadful to him than those through which he had passed.

Great numbers in despair resorted to Lima, where the house of young Almagro was always open to them, and the slender portion of his father's for∣tune, which the governor allowed him to enjoy, was spent in affording them subsistence. The warm attachment with which every person who had served under the elder Almagro devoted him∣self to his interests, was quickly transferred to his son, who was now grown up to the age of man∣hood,

In this young man the Almagrians found a point of union which they wanted, and looking up to him as their head, were ready to undertake any thing for his advancement. Nor was affection for Al∣magro their only incitement; they were urged on by their own distresses. Many of them, destitute of common necessaries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLII.</NOTE>, and weary of loitering away life, a burthen to their chief, or to such of their associates as had saved some remnant of their fortune from pillage and confiscation, longed im∣patiently for an occasion to exert their activity and courage, and began to deliberate how they might be avenged on me author of all their misery. Their frequent cabals did not pass unobserved;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conspire against the life of Pi∣zarro.</NOTE> and the governor was warned to be on his guard against men who meditated some desperate deed, and had resolution to execute it. But either from the native intrepidity of his mind, or from con∣tempt of persons whose poverty seemed to render their machinations of little consequence, he dis∣regarded the admonitions of his friends. "Be in no pain," said he carelessly, "about my life; it is perfectly safe, as long as every man in Peru knows that I can in a moment cut off any head

This security gave the Almagrians full leisure to digest and ripen every part of their scheme; and Juan de Herra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, an officer of great abilities, who had the charge of Almagro's education, took the direc∣tion of their consultations, with all the zeal which this connection inspired, and with all the authority which the ascendant that he was known to have over the mind of his pupil gave him.</P>
<P>ON Sunday, the twenty-sixth of June, at mid∣day, the season of tranquillity and repose in all sultry climates, Herrada, at the head of eighteen of the most determined conspirators, sallied out of Almagro's house in complete armour; and draw∣ing their swords, as they advanced hastily towards the governor's palace, cried out, "Long live the king, but let the tyrant die!" Their associates, warned of their motions by a signal, were in arms at different stations ready to support them. Though Pizarro was usually surrounded by such a nume∣rous train of attendants as suited the magnificence of the most opulent subject of the age in which he lived, yet as he was just risen from table, and most of his domestics had retired to their own apart∣ments, the conspirators passed through the two outer courts of the palace unobserved. They were at the bottom of the staircase, before a page in waiting could give the alarm to his master, who was conversing with a few friends in a large hall. The governor, whose steady mind no form of dan∣ger could appal, starting up, called for arms, and commanded Francisco de Chaves to make fast the door. But that officer, who did not retain so much presence of mind as to obey this prudent order, running to the top of the stair-case, wildly asked the conspirators what they meant, and whither they were going? Instead of answering, they stab∣bed
<PB N="221" REF="034476_0728_0FFDDB961F5E6D10"/>
him to the heart, and burst into the hall. Some of the persons who were there threw them∣selves from the windows; others attempted to fly; and a few drawing their swords, followed their leader into an inner apartment. The conspirators, animated with having the object of their vengeance now in view, rushed forward after them. Pizarro, with no other arms than his sword and buckler, defended the entry, and supported by his half-brother Alcantara, and his little knot of friends, he maintained the unequal contest with intrepidity worthy of his past exploits, and with the vigour of a youthful combatant, "Courage," cried he, "companions, we are yet enow to make those traitors repent of their audacity." But the armour of the conspirators protected them, while every thrust they made took effect. Alcantara fell dead at his brother's feet; his other defenders were mortally wounded. The governor, so weary that he could hardly wield his sword, and no longer able to parry the many weapons furiously aimed at him, received a deadly thrist full in his throat, sunk to the ground, and expired.</P>
<P>AS soon as he was slain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Almagro acknow∣ledged as his suc∣cessor.</NOTE> the assassins ran out into the streets, and waving their bloody swords, proclaimed the death of the tyrant. Above two hundred of their associates having joined them, they conducted young Almagro in solemn pro∣cession through the city, and assembling the magis∣trates and principal citizens, compelled them to acknowledge him as lawful successor to his father in his government. The palace of Pizarro, toge∣ther with the houses of several of his adherents, were pillaged by the soldiers, who had the satis∣faction at once of being avenged on their enemies, and of enriching themselves by the spoils of those

<P>THE boldness and success of the conspiracy, as well as the name and popular qualities of Alma∣gro,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New ap∣pearances of discord.</NOTE> drew many soldiers to his standard. Every adventurer of desperate fortune, all who were dissatisfied with Pizarro, and from the rapacious∣ness of his government in the latter years of his life, the number of malcontents was considerable, declared without hesitation in favour of Almagro, and he was soon at the head of eight hundred of the most gallant veterans in Peru. As his youth and inexperience disqualified him from taking the command of them himself, he appointed Herrada to act as general. But though Almagro speedily collected such a respectable force, the acquiescence in his government was far from being general. Pizarro had left many friends to whom his memory was dear; the barbarous assassination of a man to whom his country was so highly indebted, filled every impartial person with horror. The ignomi∣nious birth of Almagro, as well as the doubtful title on which he sounded his pretensions, led others to consider him as an usurper. The officers who commanded in some provinces refused to recognize his authority, until it was confirmed by the em∣peror. In others, particularly at Cuzco, the royal standard was erected, and preparations were begun in order to revenge the murder of their ancient leader.</P>

In his way he received accounts of Pizarro's death, and of the events which followed upon it. He immediately produced the royal commission appointing him governor of Peru, with the same privileges and authority;<NOTE PLACE="marg">who as∣sumes the title of go∣vernor.</NOTE> and his jurisdiction was acknowledged without hesitation by Benalcazar, adelantado or lieutenant-general for the emperor in Popayan, and by Pedro de Puelles, who in the absence of Gonzalo Pizarro, had the command of the troops left in Quito. Vaca de Castro not only assumed the supreme authority, but shewed that he pos∣sessed the talents which the exercise of it at that juncture required. By his influence and address he soon assembled such a body of troops, as not only set him above all fear of being exposed to any in∣sult from the adverse party, but enabled him to advance from Quito with the dignity that became his character. By dispatching persons of confi∣dence to the different settlements in Peru, with a formal notification of his arrival and of his com∣mission, he communicated to his countrymen the royal pleasure with respect to the government of the country. By private emissaries, he excited such officers as had discovered their disapprobation of Almagro's proceedings, to manifest their duty to their sovereign by supporting the person ho∣noured with his commission. Those measures were productive of great effects. Encouraged by the approach of the new governor, or prepared by his machinations, the loyal were confirmed in their principles, and avowed them with greater boldness; the timid ventured to declare their sentiments; the

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Consultati∣tions of the emperor concerning his domini¦ons in A∣merica.</NOTE>DURING those violent convulsions in Peru, the emperor and his ministers were intently employed in preparing regulations, by which they hoped not only to re-establish tranquillity there, but to intro∣duce a more perfect system of internal policy into all their settlements in the New World. It is ma∣nifest from all the events recorded in the history of America, that rapid and extensive as the Spanish conquests there had been, they were not carried on by any regular exertion of the national force, but by the occasional efforts of private adventurers. After fitting out a few of the first armaments for discovering new regions, the court of Spain, during the busy reigns of Ferdinand and of Charles V. the former the most intriguing prince of the age, and the latter the most ambitious, was encumbered with such a multiplicity of schemes, and involved in war with so many nations of Europe, that it had not leisure to attend to distant and less interesting objects. The care of prosecuting discovery, or of attempting conquest, was abandoned to individuals; and with such ardour did men push forward in this new career, on which novelty, the spirit of
<PB N="227" REF="034476_0734_0FFDDBA59E614C48"/>
adventure, avarice, ambition, and the hope of meriting heaven, prompted them with combined influence to enter, that in less than half a century almost the whole of that extensive empire which Spain now possesses in the New World, was sub∣jected to its dominion. As the Spanish court con∣tributed nothing towards the various expeditions undertaken in America, it was not entitled to claim much from their success. The sovereignty of the conquered provinces, with the fifth of the gold and silver, was reserved for the crown; every thing else was seized by the associates in each ex∣pedition as their own right. The plunder of the countries which they invaded served to demnify them for what they had expended in equipping themselves for the service, and the conquered ter∣ritory was divided among them, according to rules which custom had introduced, as permanent esta∣blishments which their successful valour merited. In the infancy of those settlements, when their ex∣tent as well as their value were unknown, many irregularities escaped observation, and it was found necessary to connive at many excesses. The con∣quered people were frequently pillaged with destructive rapacity, and their country parcelled out among its new masters in exorbitant shares, far exceeding the highest recompence due to their ser∣vices. The rude conquerors of America, inca∣pable of forming their establishments upon any general or extensive plan of policy, attentive only to private interest, unwilling to forego present gain from the prospect of remote or public benefit, seem to have had no object but to amass sudden wealth, without regarding what might be the consequences of the means by which they acquired it. But when time at length discovered to the Spanish court the importance of its American possessions, the ne∣cessity of new-modelling their whole frame became
<PB N="228" REF="034476_0735_0FFDDBA7B13ADC08"/>
obvious, and in place of the maxims and practices, prevalent among military adventurers, it was found requisite to substitute the institutions of regular government.</P>
<P>ONE evil in particular called for an immediate remedy. The conquerors of Mexico and Peru imitated the fatal example of their countrymen settled in the islands, and employed themselves in searching for gold and silver with the same incon∣siderate eagerness. Similar effects followed. The natives employed in this labour by masters, who in imposing tasks had no regard either to what they felt or to what they were able to perform, pined away and perished so fast, that there was reason to apprehend that Spain, instead of possessing coun∣tries peopled to such a degree as to be susceptible of progressive improvement, would soon remain proprietor only of a vast uninhabited desert.</P>
<P>THE emperor and his ministers were so sensible of this, and so solicitous to prevent the extinction of the Indian race, which threatened to render their acquisitions of no value, that from time to time various laws, which I have mentioned, had been made for securing to that unhappy people more gentle and equitable treatment. But the distance of America from the seat of empire, the feebleness of government in the new colonies, the avarice and audacity of soldiers unaccustomed to restraint, pre∣vented these salutary regulations from operating with any considerable influence. The evil conti∣nued to grow, and at this time the emperor found an interval of leisure from the affairs of Europe to take it into attentive consideration.<NOTE PLACE="marg">The per∣sons with whom he advises.</NOTE> He consulted not only with his ministers and the members of the council of the Indies, but called upon several per∣sons who had resided long in the New World, to aid them with the result of their experience and

observation. Fortunately for the people of Ame∣rica, among these was Bartholomew de las Casas, who happened to be then at Madrid on a mission from a Chapter of his order at Chiapa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Remes. Hist. de Chiapa, p. 146.</NOTE>. Though, since the miscarriage of his former schemes for the relief of the Indians, he had continued shut up in his cloister, or occupied in religious functions, his zeal in behalf of the former objects of his pity was so far from abating, that, from an increased knowledge of their sufferings, its ardour had aug∣mented. He seized eagerly this opportunity of reviving his favourite maxims concerning the treat∣ment of the Indians. With the moving eloquence natural to a man on whose mind the scenes which he had beheld had made a deep impression, he described the irreparable waste of the human spe∣cies in the New World, the Indian race almost to∣tally swept away in the islands in less than fifty years, and hastening to extinction on the continent with the same rapid decay. With the decisive tone of one strongly prepossessed with the truth of his own system, he imputed all this to a single cause, to the exactions and cruelty of his countrymen, and contended that nothing could prevent the de∣population of America, but the declaring of its natives to be freemen, and treating them as sub∣jects, not as slaves. Nor did he confide for the success of this proposal in the powers of his ora∣tory alone. In order to enforce them, he com∣posed his famous treatise concerning the de∣struction of America<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Remes. p. 192, 199.</NOTE>, in which he relates, with many horrid circumstances, but with apparent marks of exaggerated description, the devastation of every province which had been visited by the Spaniards.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="034476_0737_0FFDDBADF78EABE8"/>THE emperor was deeply afflicted with the re∣cital of so many actions shocking to humanity. But as his views extended far beyond those of Las Casas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His solici∣tude to in∣troduce a general re¦formation of govern∣ment.</NOTE> he perceived that relieving the Indians from oppression was but one step towards re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ering his possessions in the New World a valuable acquisi∣tion, and would be of little avail, unless he could circumscribe the power and usurpations of his own subjects there. The conquerors of America, how∣ever great their merit had been towards their coun∣try, were mostly persons of such mean birth, and of such an abject rank in society, as gave no distinc∣tion in the eye of a monarch. The exorbitant wealth with which some of them returned, gave umbrage to an age not accustomed to see men in inferior condition elevated above their level, and rising to emulate or to surpass the ancient nobility in splendour. The territories which their leaders had appropriated to themselves were of such enor∣mous extent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLIII.</NOTE>, that if the country should ever be improved in proportion to the fertility of the soil, they must grow too wealthy and too powerful for subjects. It appeared to Charles that this abuse re∣quired a remedy no less than the other, and that the regulations concerning both must be enforced by a mode of government more vigorous than had yet been introduced into America.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">New regu∣lations for this pur∣pose.</NOTE>WITH this view he framed a body of laws, containing many salutary appointments with re∣spect to the constitution and powers of the supreme council of the Indies; concerning the station and jurisdiction of the royal audiences in different parts of America; the administration of justice; the order of government, both ecclesiastical and civil. These were approved of by all ranks of men. But together with them were issued the following regu∣lations,
<PB N="231" REF="034476_0738_0FFDDBB098589AE0"/>
which excited universal alarm, and occa∣sioned the most violent convulsions: "That as the <HI>repartimientos</HI> or shares of land seized by several persons appeared to be excessive, the royal au∣diences are empowered to reduce them to a moderare extent: That upon the death of any conqueror or planter, the lands and Indians granted to him shall not descend to his widow or children, but return to the crown: That the Indians shall henceforth be exempt from personal service, and shall not be compelled to carry the baggage of travellers, to labour in the mines, or to dive in the pearl fisheries: That the stated tribute due by them to their superior shall be ascertained, and they shall be paid as servants for any work they voluntarily perform: That all persons who are or have been in public offices, all ecclesiastics of every denomination, all hospitals and monasteries, shall be deprived of their lands and Indians allotted to them, and these be annexed to the crown: That every person in Peru, who had any criminal concern in he contests between Pizarro and Almagro, should forfeit his lands and Indians <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 7. lib. vi. c. 5.

<P>ALL the Spanish ministers who had hitherto been entrusted with the direction of American affairs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">His minis∣ters remon∣strate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a∣gainst them.</NOTE> and who were best acquainted with the state of the country, remonstrated against those regula∣tions as ruinous to their in ant colonies. They represented, that the number of Spaniards who had hitherto emigrated to the New World was so extremely small, that nothing could be expected from any effort of theirs towards improving the vast regions over which they were scattered; that the success of every scheme for this purpose must

depend upon the ministry and service of the In∣dians, whose native indolence and aversion to la∣bour, no prospect of benefit or promise of reward could surmount; that the moment the right of im∣posing a task, and exacting the performance of it, was taken from their masters, every work of in∣dustry must cease, and all the sources from which wealth begun to pour in upon Spain must be stopt for ever. But Charles, tenacious at all times of his own opinions, and so much impressed at present with the view of the disorders which reigned in America, that he was willing to hazard the appli∣cation even of a dangerous remedy, persisted in his resolution of publishing the laws. That they might be carried into execution with greater vi∣gour and authority, he authorised Francisco Tello de Sandoval to repair to Mexico as <HI>Visitador</HI> or superintendant of that country, and to co-operate with Antonio de Mendoza, the viceroy, in en∣forcing them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A viceroy appointed for Peru.</NOTE> He appointed Blasco Nugnez Vela to be governor of Peru, with the title of Vice∣roy; and in order to strengthen his administration, he established a court of royal audience▪ in Lima,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1543.</NOTE> in which four lawyers of eminence were to preside as judges<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. iii. c. 24.

But the colony in New Spain had now been so

long accustomed to the restraints of law and autho∣rity under the steady and prudent administration of Mendoza, that how much soever the spirit of the new statutes was derested and dreaded, no at∣tempt was made to obstruct the publication of them by any act of violence unbecoming subjects. The magistrates and principal inhabitants, how∣ever, presented dutiful addresses to the viceroy and superintendent, representing the fatal consequences of enforcing them. Happily for them, Mendoza, by long residence in the country, was so thoroughly acquainted with its state, that he knew what was for its interest as well as what it could bear; and Sandoval, though new in office, displayed a degree of moderation seldom possessed by persons just en∣tering upon the exercise of power. They engaged to suspend, for some time, the execution of what was offensive in the new laws, and not only con∣sented that a deputation of citizens should be sent to Europe to lay before the emperor the appre∣hensions of his subjects in New Spain with respect to their tendency and effects, but they concurred with them in supporting their sentiments. Charles, moved by the opinion of men whose abilities and integrity entitled them to decide concerning what fell immediately under their own view, granted such a relaxation of the rigour of the laws as re-established the colony in its former tranquillity.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fernandez Hist. lib. i. c. 3, 4, 5.

inspection of the parent state, and intoxicated with the sudden acquisition of wealth, carried on all their operations with greater licence and irregula∣rity than any body of adventurers in the New World. Amidst the general subversion of law and order, occasioned by two successive civil wars, when each individual was at liberty to decide for himself, without any guide but his own interest or passions, this turbulent spirit rose above all sense of subordination. To men thus corrupted by anarchy, the introduction of regular government, the power of a viceroy, and the authority of a re∣spectable court of judicature, would of themselves have appeared formidable restraints, to which they would have submitted with reluctance. But they re∣volted with indignation against the idea of comply∣ing with laws, by which they were to be stripped at once of all they had earned so hardly during many years of service and suffering. As the account of the new laws spread successively through the dif∣ferent settlements, the inhabitants ran together, the women in tears, and the men exclaiming against the injustice and ingratitude of their sovereign in depriving them, unheard and unconvicted, of their possessions. "Is this," cried they, "the recom∣pence due to persons, who, without public aid, at their own expence, and by their own valour, have subjected to the crown of Castile territories of such immense extent and opulence?

From this, however, they were diverted by the address of Vaca de Castro, who flattered them with hopes, that, as soon as the viceroy and judges should ar∣rive, and had leisure to examine their petitions and remonstrances, they would concur with them in endeavouring to procure some mitigation in the

rigour of laws which had been framed without due attention either to the state of the country, or to the sentiments of the people. A greater degree of accommodation to these, and even some concessions on the part of government, were now become re∣quisite to compose the present ferment, and to soothe the colonists into submission, by inspiring them with confidence in their superiors.

Amazement and con∣sternation went before him as he approached; and so little solicitous was he to prevent these from aug∣menting, that, on entering the capital, he openly avowed that he came to obey the orders of his sovereign, not to dispense with his laws. This harsh declaration was accompanied with what ren∣dered it still more intolerable, haughtiness in de∣portment, a tone of arrogance and decision in dis∣course,

and an insolence of office grievous to men little accustomed to hold civil authority in high re∣spect. Every attempt to procure a suspension or mitigation of the new laws, the viceroy considered as flowing from a spirit of disaffection that tended to rebellion. Several persons of rank were con∣fined, and some put to death, without any form of trial. Vaca de Castro was arrested, and notwith∣standing the dignity of his former rank, and his merit, in having prevented a general insurrection in the colony, he was loaded with chains, and shut up in the common jail<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. iv. c. 23, 24, 25.

From the time that the purport of the new regulations was known in Peru, every Spaniard there turned his eyes towards Gonzalo Pizarro, as the only person able to avert the ruin with which they threatened the colony. From all quarters, letters and addresses were sent to him, conjuring him to stand forth as their common pro∣tector, and offering to support him in the attempt with their lives and fortunes. Gonzalo, though inferior in talents to his other brothers, was equally ambitious, and of courage no less daring. The behaviour of an ungrateful court towards his bro∣thers and himself, dwelt continually on his mind. Ferdinand a state prisoner in Europe, the children of the governor in custody of the viceroy, and sent aboard his fleet, himself reduced to the condition
<PB N="238" REF="034476_0745_0FFDDBC411E2BC40"/>
of a private citizen in a country, for the discovery and conquest of which Spain was indebted to his family. These thoughts prompted him to seek for vengeance, and to assert the rights of his family, of which he now considered himself as the guar∣dian and the heir. But as no Spaniard can easily surmount that veneration for his sovereign which seems to be interwoven in his frame, the idea of marching in arms against the royal standard filled him with horror. He hesitated long, and still unresolved, when the violence of the viceroy, the universal call of his countrymen, and the certainty of becoming soon a victim himself to the severity of the new laws, moved him to quit his residence at Chuquisaca de la Plata, and repair to Cuzco. All the inhabitants went out to meet him, and received him with transports of joy as the deliverer of the colony. In the fervour of their zeal, they elected him procurator-general of the Spanish nation in Peru, to solicit the repeal of the late regulations. They empowered him to lay their remonstrances before the royal audience in Lima, and upon pre∣text of danger from the Indians, authorised him to march thither in arms.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1544.</NOTE> Under sanction of this nomination Pizarro took possession of the royal treasure, appointed officers, levied soldiers, seized a large train of artillery which Vaca de Castro had deposited in Gumanga, and set out for Lima, as if he had been advancing against a public enemy.

this requisition. It was made, probably, with no such intention, but only to throw a decent veil over their own conduct; for Cepeda, the president of the court of audience, a pragmatical and aspiring lawyer, seems to have held a secret correspondence with Pizarro, and had already formed the plan, which he afterwards executed, of devoting himself to his service. The imprisonment of the viceroy, the usurpation of the judges, together with the universal confusion and anarchy consequent upon events so singular and unexpected, opened new and vast prospects to Pizarro. He now beheld the supreme power within his reach. Nor did he want courage to push on towards the object which for∣tune presented to his view. Carvajal, the promp∣ter of his resolutions, and guide of all his actions, had long fixed his eye upon it as the only end at which Pizarro ought to aim. Instead of the infe∣rior function of procurator for the Spanish settle∣ments in Peru, he openly demanded to be gover∣nor and captain-general of the whole province, and required the court of audience to grant him a com∣mission to that effect. At the head of twelve hun∣dred men, within a mile of Lima, where there was neither leader nor army to oppose him, such a re∣quest carried with it the authority of a command. But the judges, either from unwillingness to relin∣quish power, or from a desire of preserving some attention to appearances, hesitated, or seemed to hesitate, about complying with what he demanded. Carvajal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He assumes the govern∣ment.</NOTE> impatient of delay, and impetuous in all his operations, marched into the city by night, seized several officers of distinction obnoxious to Pizarro, and hanged them without the formality of a trial. Next morning the court of audience issued a commission in the emperor's name, appointing Pizarro governor of Peru, with full powers, civil

Pizarro had scarcely begun to exercise the new powers with which he was invested, when he beheld formidable enemies rise up to oppose him. The viceroy having been put on board a vessel by the judges of the audience, in order that he might be carried to Spain under custody of Juan Alvarez, one of their own number; as soon as they were out at sea, Alvarez, either touched with re∣morse or moved by fear, kneeled down to his pri∣soner, declaring him from that moment to be free, and that he himself, and every person in the ship, would obey him as the legal representative of their sovereign. Nugnez Vela ordered the pilot of the vessel to shape his course towards Tumbez, and as soon as he landed there, erected the royal standard, and resumed his functions of viceroy. Several persons of note, to whom the contagion of the se∣ditious spirit which reigned at Cuzco and Lima had not reached, instantly avowed their resolution to support his authority<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. v. c. 9.

severity, soon augmented the number of the vice∣roy's adherents, as it forced some leading men in the colony to fly to him for refuge. While he was gathering such strength at Tumbez, that his forces began to assume the appearance of what was considered as an army in America, Diego Centeno, a bold and active officer, exasperated by the cruelty and oppression of Pizarro's lieutenant-governor in the province of Charcas, formed a conspiracy against his life, cut him off, and declared for the viceroy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib v. c. 18.

As he was master of the public re∣venues in Peru, and most of the military men were attached to his family, his troops were so nume∣rous, that the viceroy, unable to face them, re∣treated towards Quito.

From the time that Pizarro obtained possession of the government of Peru, he inculcated the same maxim with greater earnestness. Upon receiving
<PB N="245" REF="034476_0752_0FFDDBD7BA69CFC8"/>
an account of the victory at Quito, he remonstrated with him in a tone still more peremptory, "You have usurped (said he, in a letter written to Pizarro on that occasion) the supreme power in this coun∣try, in contempt of the emperor's commission to the viceroy. You have marched, in hostile array, against the royal standard; you have attacked the representative of your sovereign in the field, have defeated him, and cut off his head. Think not that ever a monarch will forgive such insults on his dignity, or that any reconciliation with him can be cordial or sincere. Depend no longer on the pre∣carious favour of another. Assume yourself the sovereignty over a country, to the dominion of which your family has a title founded on the rights both of discovery and conquest. It is in your power to attach every Spaniard in Peru of any consequence inviolably to your interest by liberal grants of lands and of Indians, or by instituting ranks of nobility, and creating titles of honour similar to those which are courted with so much eagerness in Europe. By establishing orders of knighthood, with privileges and distinctions re∣sembling those in Spain, you may bestow a grati∣fication upon the officers in your service, suited to the ideas of military men. Nor is it to your coun∣trymen only that you ought to attend; endeavour to gain the natives. By marrying the Coya, or daugh∣ter of the Sun next in succession to the crown, you will induce the Indians, out of veneration for the blood of their antient princes, to unite with the Spaniards in support of your authority. Thus, at the head of the antient inhabitants of Peru, as well as of the new settlers there, you may set at defi∣ance the power of Spain, and repel with ease any feeble force which it can send at such a distance."

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">But chuses to negociate with the court of Spain.</NOTE>PIZARRO listened attentively to both, and could not conceal the satisfaction with which he contem∣plated the object that they presented to his view.

Instead of aspiring at independent power, he confined his views to the obtaining from the court of Spain a confirmation of the authority which he now pos∣sessed; and for that purpose, he sent an officer of distinction thither, to give such a representation of his conduct, and of the state of the country, as might induce the emperor and his ministers, either from inclination or from necessity, to continue him in his present station.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Consulta∣tions of the Spanish mi∣nisters.</NOTE>WHILE PIZARRO was deliberating with respect to the part which he should take, consultations were held in Spain, with no less solicitude, concerning the measures which ought to be pursued in order to re-establish the emperor's authority in Peru. Though unacquainted with the last excesses of outrage to
<PB N="247" REF="034476_0754_0FFDDBDB0F80DF40"/>
which the malcontents had proceeded in that coun∣try, the court had received an account of the insur∣rection against the viceroy, of his imprisonment, and the usurpation of the government by Pizarro. A revolution so alarming called for an immediate in∣terposition of the emperor's abilities and authority. But as he was fully occupied at that time in Ger∣many, in conducting the war against the famous league of Smalkalde, one of the most interesting and arduous enterprises in his reign, the care of pro∣viding a remedy for the disorders in Peru devolved upon his son Philip, and the counsellors whom Charles had appointed to assist him in the govern∣ment of Spain during his absence. At first view, the actions of Pizarro and his adherents, appeared so repugnant to the duty of subjects towards their sovereign, that the greater part of the ministers in∣sisted on declaring them instantly to be guilty of rebellion, and on proceeding to punish them with exemplary rigour. But when the fervour of their zeal and indignation began to abate, innumerable obstacles to the execution of this measure presented themselves. The veteran bands of infantry, the strength and glory of the Spanish armies, were then employed in Germany. Spain, exhausted of men and money by a long series of wars, in which she had been involved by the restless ambition of two successive monarchs, could not easily equip an armament of sufficient force to reduce Pizarro. To tansport any respectable body of troops to a country so remote as Peru, appeared almost im∣possible. While Pizarro continued master of the South Sea, the direct rout by Nombre de Dios and Panama was impracticable. An attempt to march to Quito by land through the new kingdom of Granada, and the province of Popayan, across regions of prodigious extent, desolate, unhealthy,
<PB N="248" REF="034476_0755_0FFDDBDECD984538"/>
or inhabited by force and hostile tribes, would be attended with unsurmountable danger and hardships. The passage to the South-Sea by the Straits of Magellan was so tedious, so uncertain, and so little known in that age, that no confidence could be placed in any effort carried on in a course of navi∣gation so remote and precarious. Nothing th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> remained but to relinquish the system which the ardour of their loyalty had first suggested, and to attempt by lenient measures what could not be af∣fected by force. It was manifest, from Pizarro's solicitude to represent his conduct in a favourable light to the emperor, that, notwithstanding the excesses of which he had been guilty, he still re∣tained sentiments of veneration for his sovereign. By a proper application to these, together with some such concessions as should discover a spirit of moderation and forbearance in government, there was still room to hope that he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ht be yet re∣claimed, or the ideas of loyalty natural to Spaniards might so far revive among his followers, that they would no longer lend their aid to uphold his usurped authority.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gasca ap∣pointed to repair to Peru as pre∣sident.</NOTE>THE success, however, of this negociation, no less delicate than it was important, depended en∣tirely on the abilities and address of the person to whom it should be committed. After weighing with much attention the comparative merit of va∣rious persons, the Spanish ministers fixed with unanimity of choice upon Pedro de la Gasca, a priest in no higher station than that of counsellor in the Inquisition. Though in no public office, he had been occasionally employed by government in affairs of trust and consequence, and had conduct∣ed them with no less skill than success; displaying a gentle and insinuating temper, accompanied with much firmness; probity, superior to any feeling of
<PB N="249" REF="034476_0756_0FFDDBE166C68F38"/>
private interest; and a cautious circumspection in concerting measures, followed by such vigour in executing them, as is rarely found in alliance with the other. These qualities marked him out for the function to which he was destined. The emperor, to whom Gasca was not unknown, warmly ap∣proved of the choice, and communicated it to him in a letter containing expressions of good-will and confidence, no less honourable to the prince who wrote, than to the subject who received it. Gasca, notwithstanding his advanced age and feeble consti∣tution, and though, from the apprehensions natural to a man, who, during the course of his life, had never been out of his own country, he dreaded the effects of a long voyage, and of an unhealthy cli∣mate<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fernandez, lib. ii. c. 17.</NOTE>, did not hesitate a moment about complying with the will of his sovereign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His mode∣ration.</NOTE> But as a proof that it was from this principle alone he acted, he re∣fused a bishopric which was offered to him, in order that he might appear in Peru with a more dignified character; he would accept of no higher title than that of president of the court of audience in Lima; and declared that he would receive no salary on account of his discharging the duties of that of∣fice. All he required was, that the expence of supporting his family should be defrayed by the public, and as he was to go like a minister of peace with his gown and breviary, and without any reti∣nue but a few domestics, this would not load the revenue with any enormous burden<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. vi. c. 6.

very different tone. He insisted, as he was to be employed in a country so remote from the seat of government, where he could not have recourse to his sovereign for new instructions on every emer∣gence; and as the whole success of his negoci∣ations must depend upon the confidence which the people with whom he had to treat could place in the extent of his powers, that he ought to be invested with unlimited authority; that his juris∣diction must reach to all persons and to all causes; that he must be empowered to pardon, to punish, or to reward, as circumstances and the behaviour of different men might require; that in case of resistance from the malcontents, he might be au∣thorised to reduce them to obedience by force of arms, to levy troops for that purpose, and to call for assistance from the governors of all the Spanish settlements in America. These powers, though manifestly conducive to the great objects of his mission, appeared to the Spanish ministers to be inalienable prerogatives of royalty, which ought not to be delegated to a subject, and they refused to grant them. But the emperor's views were more enlarged. As, from the nature of his employ∣ment, Gasca must be entrusted with discretionary power in several points, and all his efforts might prove ineffectual if he was circumscribed in any one particular, Charles scrupled not to invest him with authority to the full extent that he demanded. Highly satisfied with this fresh proof of his master's confidence, Gasca hastened his departure, and, with∣out either money or troops, set out to quell a for∣midable rebellion<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fernandez, lib. ii. c. 16—18.</NOTE>.</P>

by order of Pizarro, with a considerable body of men to oppose the landing of any hostile forces. But Gasca appeared in such pacific guise, with a train so little formidable, and with a title of no such dignity as to excite terror, that he was re∣ceived with much respect. From Nombre de Dios he advanced to Panama, and met with a similar reception from Hinojosa, whom Pizarro had en∣trusted with the government of that town, and the command of his fleet stationed there. In both places he held the same language, declaring that he was sent by their sovereign as a messenger of peace, not as a minister of vengeance; that he came to redress all their grievances, to revoke the laws which had excited alarm, to pardon past of∣fences, and to re-establish order and justice in the government of Peru. His mild deportment, the simplicity of his manners, the sanctity of his profes∣sion, and a winning appearance of candour, gained credit to his declarations. The veneration due to a person cloathed with legal authority, and acting in virtue of a royal commission, began to revive among men accustomed for some time to nothing more respectable than an usurped jurisdiction. Hinojosa, Mexia, and several other officers of dis∣tinction, to each of whom Gasca applied separately, were gained over to his interest, and waited only for some decent occasion of declaring openly in his favour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fernandez, lib. ii. c. 21, &amp;c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rat, lib. vi. c. 6, 7.

To this desperate resolution he added another highly preposterous. He sent a new deputation to Spain to justify this conduct, and to insist, in name of all the communities in Peru, for a confirmation of the government to himself during life, as the only means of preserving tranquillity there. The persons en∣trusted with this strange commission, intimated the intention of Pizarro to the president, and required him, in his name, to depart from Panama and return to Spain. They carried likewise secret instructions to Hinojosa, directing him to offer Gasca a present of fifty thousand pesos, if he would comply vo∣luntarily with what was demanded of him; and if he should continue obstinate, to cut him off either by assassination or poison<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate. lib. vi. c. 8.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Gasca gains his fleet.</NOTE>MANY circumstances concurred in pushing on Pizarro to those wild measures. Having been once accustomed to supreme command, he could not bear the thoughts of descending to a private station.

But he knew not that a spirit of de∣fection had already begun to spread among those whom he trusted most. Hinojosa, amazed at Pi∣zarro's precipitate resolution of setting himself in opposition to the emperor's commission, and dis∣daining to be his instrument in perpetrating the odious crimes pointed out in his secret instructions, publicly recognized the title of the president to the supreme authority in Peru. The officers under his command did the same. Such was the con∣tagious influence of the example, that it reached even the deputies who had been sent from Peru; and at the time when Pizarro expected to hear either of Gasca's return to Spain, or of his death, he received an account of his being master of the fleet, of Panama, and of the troops stationed there.</P>

Before he got within sight of the enemy at Huarina, near the lake Titiaca, he could not muster more than four hundred soldiers. But these he justly considered as men of tried attach∣ment, on whom he might depend. They were indeed the boldest and most desperate of his fol∣lowers, conscious, like himself, of crimes for which they could hardly expect forgiveness, and without any hope but in the success of their arms. With these he did not hesitate to attack Centeno's troops, though double to his own in number.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oct. 20.</NOTE> The royalists did not decline the combat.

<P>BUT events happened in other parts of Peru, which more than counterbalanced the splendid victory at Huarina. Pizarro had scarcely left Lima, when the citizens, weary of his oppressive domi∣nion, erected the royal standard, and Aldana, with a detachment of soldiers from the fleet, took pos∣session of the town.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Gasca lands at Peru.</NOTE> About the same time<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. vi. c. 17.</NOTE>, Gasca landed at Tumbez with five hundred men. Encouraged by his presence, every settlement in the low country declared for the king. The situ∣ation of the two parties was now perfectly reversed; Cuzco and the adjacent provinces were possessed by Pizarro; all the rest of the empire, from Quito southward, acknowledged the jurisdiction of the president. As his numbers augmented fast, Gasca advanced into the interior part of the coun∣try. His behaviour still continued to be gentle and unassuming; he expressed on every occasion, his ardent wish of terminating the contest without bloodshed. More solicitous to reclaim than to punish, he upbraided no man for past offences, but received them as a father receives penitent children returning to a sense of their duty. Though desirous of peace, he did not slacken his preparations for war. He appointed the general rendezvous of his troops in the fertile valley of Xauxa, on the road to Cuzco<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib vii. c. 9.

attempt towards an accommodation with Pizarro, but that he might train his new soldiers to the use of arms, and accustom them to the discipline of a camp, before he led them against a body of vic∣torious veterans. Pizarro, intoxicated with the success which had hitherto accompanied his arms, and elated with having again near a thousand men under his command, refused to listen to any terms, although Cepeda, together with several of his officers, and even Carvajal himself<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLVI.</NOTE>, gave it as their advice to close with the president's offer of a general indemnity, and the revocation of the ob∣noxious laws<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. vii. c. 6. Vega, p. 11. lib. v. c. 27.</NOTE>. Gasca having tried in vain every expedient to avoid imbruing his hands in the blood of his countrymen, began to move towards Cuzco,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dec. 29.</NOTE> at the head of sixteen hundred men.</P>
<P>PIZARRO, confident of victory,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Both parties prepare for battle</NOTE> suffered the royalists to pass all the rivers which lie between Guamanga and Cuzco without opposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1548.</NOTE> and to advance within four leagues of that capital, flat∣tering himself that a defeat in such a situation as rendered escape impracticable would at once ter∣minate the war. He then marched out to meet the enemy, and Carvajal chose his ground, and made the disposition of the troops with the discern∣ing eye,<NOTE PLACE="marg">April 9.</NOTE> and profound knowledge in the art of war conspicuous in all his operations. As the two armies moved forward slowly to the charge, the appearance of each was singular. In that of Pi∣zarro, composed of men enriched with the spoils of the most opulent country in America, every officer, and almost all the private men were clothed in stuffs of silk, or brocade, embroidered with gold and silver; and their horses, their arms, their standards, were adorned with all the pride of
<PB N="258" REF="034476_0765_0FFDDBF9703E8E30"/>
military pomp<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib vi. c. 11.</NOTE>. That of Gasca, though not so splendid, exhibited what was no less striking. He himself, accompanied by the archbishop of Lima, the Bishops of Quito and Cuzco, and a great num∣ber of ecclesiastics, marching along the lines, bless∣ing the men, and encouraging them to a resolute discharge of their duty.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pizarro de∣serted by his troops,</NOTE>WHEN both armies were just ready to engage, Cepeda set spurs to his horse, galloped off and sur∣rendered himself to the president. Garcilasso de la Vega, and other officers of note, followed his ex∣ample. The revolt of persons in such high rank struck all with amazement. The mutual confidence on which the union and strength of armies depend, ceased at once. Distrust and consternation spread, from rank to rank. Some silently slipped away, others threw down their arms, the greatest number went over to the royalists. Pizarro, Carvajal, and some leaders, employed authority, threats, and entreaties, to stop them, but in vain. In less than half an hour, a body of men, which might have decided the fate of the Peruvian empire, was totally dispersed. Pizarro, seeing all irretrievably lost, cried out in amazement to a few officers who still faithfully adhered to him, "What remains for us to do?" "Let us rush," replied one of them, "upon the enemy's firmest battalion, and die like Romans."

small number of the most distinguished or noto∣rious offenders, were punished capitally. Pizarro was beheaded on the day after he surrendered. He submitted to his fate with a composed dignity, and seemed desirous to atone by repentance for the crimes which he had committed. The end of Car∣vajal was suitable to his life. On his trial he offered no defence. When the sentence adjudging him to be hanged was pronounced, he carelessly re∣plied, "One can die but once." During the in∣terval between the sentence and execution, he dis∣covered no sign either of remorse for the past, or of solicitude about the future; scoffing at all who visited him, in his usual sarcastic vein of mirth, with the same quickness of repartee and gross plea∣santry as at any other period of his life. Cepe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a, more criminal than either, ought to have shared the same fate; but the merit of having deserted his associates at such a critical moment, and with such decisive effect, saved him from immediate punish∣ment.

<P>IN the minute detail which the contemporary historians have given of the civil dissentions that raged in Peru, with little interruption, during ten years, many circumstances occur so striking, and which indicate such an uncommon state of manners, as to merit particular attention.</P>

who contended for superiority, not one man acted as a hired soldier, that follows his standard for pay. Every adventurer in Peru considered himself as a conqueror, entitled, by his services, to an establishment in that country which had been acquired by his valour. In the contests between the rival chiefs, each chose his side as he was di∣rected by his own judgment or affections. He joined his commander as a companion of his for∣tune, and disdained to degrade himself by receiving the wages of a mercenary. It was to their sword, not to pre-eminence in office, or nobility of birth, that most of the leaders whom they followed were indebted for their elevation; and each of their adherents hoped, by the same means, to open a way for himself to the possession of power and wealth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vega, p. 11. lib. iv. c. 38, 41.</NOTE>.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Armies im∣mensely ex∣pensive;</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT though the troops in Peru served without any regular pay, they were raised at immense ex∣pence. Among men accustomed to divide the spoils of an opulent country, the desire of obtain∣ing wealth acquired incredible force. The ardour of pursuit augmented in proportion to the hope of success. Where all were intent on the same object, and under the dominion of the same passion, there was but one mode of gaining men, or of securing their attachment. Officers of name and influence, besides the promise of future establishments, re∣ceived in hand large gratuities from the chief with whom they engaged. Gonzalo Pizarro, in order to raise a thousand men, advanced five hundred thousand pesos<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Fernandez, lib. ii. c. 54.</NOTE>. Gasca expended in levying the troops which he led against Pizarro nine hundred thousand pesos<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. vii. c. 10. Herrera, dec. 8. lib. v. c. 7.</NOTE>. The distribution of property,
<PB N="261" REF="034476_0768_0FFDDC028D146768"/>
bestowed as the reward of services, was still more exorbitant. Cepeda, as the recompence of his perfidy and address, in persuading the court of royal audience to give the sanction of its authority to the usurped jurisdiction of Pizarro,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and im∣mense re∣wards to individuals.</NOTE> received a grant of lands which yielded an annual income of a hundred and fifty thousand pesos<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gomara, c. 164.</NOTE>. Hinojosa, who, by his early defection from Pizarro, and sur∣render of the fleet to Gasca, decided the fate of Peru, obtained a district of country affording two hundred thousand pesos of yearly value<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vega, p. 11. lib. vi. c. 3.</NOTE>. While such rewards were dealt out to the principal offi∣cers, with more than royal munificence, propor∣tional shares were conferred upon those of inferior rank.</P>
<P>SUCH a rapid change of fortune produced its natural effects. It gave birth to new wants,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pro∣fusion and luxury.</NOTE> and new desires. Veterans, long accustomed to hard∣ship and toil, acquired of a sudden a taste for pro∣fuse and inconsiderate dissipation, and indulged in all the excesses of military licentiousness. The riot of low debauchery occupied some; a relish for expensive luxuries spread among others<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. ii. c. 3. dec. 8. lib. viii. c. 10.</NOTE>. The meanest soldier in Peru wrould have thought him∣self degraded by marching on foot; and at a time when the prices of horses in that country were ex∣orbitant, each insisted on being furnished with one before he would take the field. But though less patient under the fatigue and hardships of service, they were ready to face danger and death with as much intrepidity as ever; and animated by the hope of new rewards, they never failed, on the day of bat∣tle, to display all their ancient valour.</P>
<P>TOGETHER with their courage,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ferocity with which their con∣tests were carried on.</NOTE> they retained all the ferocity by which they were originally dis∣tinguished.
<PB N="262" REF="034476_0769_0FFDDC041CE54EF0"/>
Civil discord never raged with a more fell spirit than among the Spaniards in Peru. To all the passions which usually envenom contests among countrymen, avarice was added, and ren∣dered their enmity more rancorous. Eagerness to seize the valuable forfeitures expected upon the death of every opponent, shut the door against mercy. To be wealthy, was of itself sufficient to expose a man to accusation, or to subject him to punishment. On the slightest suspicions, Pizarro condemned many of the most opulent inhabitants in Peru to death. Carvajal, without searching for any pretext to justify his cruelty, cut off many more. The number of those who suffered by the hand of the executioner, was not much inferior to what fell in the field<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLVII.</NOTE>; and the greater part was condemned without the formality of any legal trial.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and want of faith.</NOTE>THE violence with which the contending parties treated their opponents was not accompanied with its usual attendants, attachment and fidelity to those with whom they acted. The ties of honour, which ought to be held sacred among soldiers and the principle of integrity, interwoven as thoroughly in the Spanish character as in that of any nation, seem to have been equally forgotten. Even regard for decency, and the sense of shame, were totally lost. During their dissentions, there was hardly a Spaniard in Peru who did not abandon the party which he had originally espoused, betray the asso∣ciates with whom he had united, and violate the engagements under which he had come. The viceroy Nugnez Vela was ruined by the treachery of Cepeda and the other judges of the royal au∣dience, who were bound by the duties of their
<PB N="263" REF="034476_0770_0FFDDC05E30B7B38"/>
function to have supported his authority. The chief advisers and companions of Gonzalo Pizarro's revolt, were the first to forsake him, and submit to his enemies. His fleet was given up to Gasca, by the man whom he had singled out among his officers to entrust with that important command. On the day that was to decide his fate, an army of veterans, in sight of the enemy, threw down their arms without striking a blow, and deserted a leader who had often conducted them to victory. In∣stances of such general and avowed contempt of the principles and obligations which attach man to man, and bind them together in social union, rarely occur in history. It is only where men are far removed from the seat of government, where the restraints of law and order are little felt, where the prospect of gain is unbounded, and were immense wealth may cover the crimes bv which it is ac∣quired, that we can find any parallel to the levity, the rapaciousness, the perfidy and corruption pre∣valent among the Spaniards in Peru.</P>

But two very interesting objects still remained to occupy the president's attention. The one was to find immediately such employment for a multitude of turbulent and daring adventurers with which the country was filled, as might prevent them from exciting new commotions. The other, to bestow proper gratifications upon those to whose loyalty and valour he had been indebted for his success. The former of these was in some measure accom∣plished, by appointing Pedro de Valdivia to prose∣cute the conquest of Chili; and by empowering Diego Centeno to undertake the discovery of the vast regions bordering on the river De la Plata.
<PB N="264" REF="034476_0771_0FFDDC09A0CC1A58"/>
The reputation of those leaders, together with the hopes of acquiring wealth, and of rising to conse∣quence in some unexplored country, alluring many of the most indigent and desperate soldiers to follow their standards, drained off no inconsiderable por∣tion of that mutinous spirit which Gasca dreaded.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">His divi∣sion of the country among his followers.</NOTE>THE latter was an affair of greater difficulty, and to be adjusted with a more attentive and deli∣cate hand. The <HI>repartimientos,</HI> or allotments of lands and Indians which fell to be distributed, in consequence of the death or forfeiture of the for∣mer possessors, exceeded two millions of pesos of yearly rent<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vega, p. 11. lib. vi. c. 4.</NOTE>. Gasca, when now absolute master of this immense property, retained the same disin∣terested sentiments which he had originally pro∣fessed and refused to reserve the smallest portion of it for himself. But the number of claimants was great; and whilst the vanity or avarice of every, individual fixed the value of his own services, and estimated the recompence which he thought due to him, the pretensions of each were so extravagant, that it was impossible to satisfy all. Gasca listened to them one by one, with the most patient atten∣tion; and that he might have leisure to weigh the comparative merit of their several claims with ac∣curacy, he retired, with the archbishop of Lima and a single secretary, to a village twelve leagues from Cuzco. There he spent several days in allotting to each a district of lands and number of Indians, in proportion to his idea of their past services and fu∣ture importance. But that he might get beyond the reach of the fierce storm of clamour and rage, which he foresaw would burst out on the publica∣tion of his decree, notwithstanding the impartial equity with which he had framed it, he set out for

Among soldiers prompt to action, such seditious discourse would have been soon followed by deeds no less violent, and they already began to turn their eyes towards some discontented leaders, expecting them to stand forth in redress of their wrongs.

But that the public security might rest on a foundation more stable than their good affection, he endeavoured to strengthen the hands of his successors in office, by re-establish∣ing the regular administration of justice in every part of the empire. He introduced order and sim∣plicity into the mode of collecting the royal reve∣nue.
<PB N="266" REF="034476_0773_0FFDDC0DCE3D4F38"/>
He issued regulations concerning the treat∣ment of the Indians, well calculated to protect them from oppression, and to provide for their instruction in the principles of religion, without depriving the Spaniards of the benefit accruing from their labour. Having now accomplished every object of his mis∣sion,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1550.</NOTE> Gasca, longing to return again to a private station,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Feb. 1. and sets out for Spain.</NOTE> committed the government of Peru to the court of audience, and set out for Spain. As, du∣ring the anarchy and turbulence of the four last years, there had been no remittance made of the royal revenue, he carried with him thirteen hundred thousand pesos of public money, which the oeco∣nomy and order of his administration enabled him to save, after paying all the expences of the war.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His recep∣tion there.</NOTE></P>
<P>HE was received in his native country with uni∣versal admiration of his abilities, and of his virtue. Both were, indeed, highly conspicuous. Without army, or fleet, or public funds; with a train so simple, that only three thousand ducats were ex∣pended in equipping him<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fernandez, lib. ii. c. 18.</NOTE>, he set out to oppose a formidable rebellion. By his address and talents he supplied all those defects, and seemed to create instruments for executing his designs. He ac∣quired such a naval force, as gave him the com∣mand of the sea. He raised a body of men able to cope with the veteran bands which gave law to Peru. He vanquished their leader, on whose arms victory had hitherto attended, and in place of anarchy and usurpation, he established the govern∣ment of laws, and the authority of the rightful sovereign. But the praise bestowed on his abili∣ties, was exceeded by that which his virtue merited. After residing in a country where wealth presented allurements which had seduced every person who
<PB N="267" REF="034476_0774_0FFDDC1178C4FD50"/>
had hitherto possessed power there, he returned from that trying station with integrity not only un∣tainted but unsuspected. After distributing among his countrymen possessions of greater extent and value than had ever been in the disposal of a subject of any age or nation, he himself remained in his ori∣ginal state of poverty; and at the very time when he brought such a large recruit to the royal treasury, he was obliged to apply by petition for a small sum to discharge some petty debts which he had con∣tracted during the course of his service<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MS. penes me.</NOTE>. Charles was not insensible to such disinterested merit. Gasca was received by him with the most distinguishing marks of esteem, and being promoted to the bishop∣ric of Palencia, he passed the remainder of his days in the tranquillity of retirement, respected by his country, honoured by his sovereign, and beloved by all.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all Gasca's wise regulati∣ons, the tranquillity of Peru was not of long con∣tinuance. In a country, where the authority of government had been almost forgotten during the long prevalence of anarchy and misrule, where there were disappointed leaders ripe for revolt, and se∣ditious soldiers ready to follow them, it was not difficult to raise combustion. Several successive in∣surrections desolated the country for some years. But as those, though fierce, were only transient storms, excited rather by the ambition and turbu∣lence of particular men, than by general or public motives, the detail of them is not the object of this history. These commotions in Peru, like every thing of extreme violence either in the natural or political body, were not of long duration, and by carrying off the corrupted humours which had given rise to the disorders, they contributed in the
<PB N="268" REF="034476_0775_0FFDDC14160C39E0"/>
end to strengthen the society which at first they threatened to destroy, During their fierce contests, several of the first invaders of Peru, and many of those licentious adventurers whom the same of their success had allured thither, fell by each other's hands. Each of the parties, as they alternately prevailed in the struggle, gradually cleared the country of a number of turbulent spirits, by exe∣cuting, proscribing, or banishing their opponents. Men less enterprising, less desperate, and more ac∣customed to move in the path of sober and peaceable industry, settled in Peru; and the royal authority was gradually established as firmly there as in the other Spanish colonies.</P>

The people of both the great empires in America, like the rude tribes around them, were totally unacquainted with the useful metals, and the progress which they had made in extending their dominion over the animal creation was in∣considerable. The Mexicans had gone no farther than to tame and rear turkeys, ducks, a species of small dogs, and rabbits<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 11. lib. vii. c. 12.</NOTE>. By this feeble essay of ingenuity, the means of subsistence were rendered somewhat more plentiful and secure, than when men depend solely on hunting; but they had no idea of attempting to subdue the more robust ani∣mals, or of deriving any aid from their ministry in carrying on works of labour. The Peruvians seem to have neglected the inferior animals, and had not rendered any of them domestic except the duck; but they were more fortunate in taming the Llama, an animal peculiar to their country, of a form which bears some resemblance to a deer, and some to a camel, and is of a size somewhat larger than a sheep. Under the protection of man, this species multiplied greatly. Its wool furnished the Peruvians with clothing. Its flesh with food. It was even employed as a beast of burden, and carried a moderate load with much patience and

It was never used for draught; and the breed being confined to the mountainous country, its service, if we may judge by incidents which occur in the early Spanish writers, was not very extensive among the Peruvians in their original state.</P>
<P>IN tracing the line by which nations proceed towards civilization, the discovery of the useful metals, and the acquisition of dominion over the animal creation, have been marked as steps of ca∣pital importance in their progress. In our conti∣nent, long after men had attained both, society continued in that state which is denominated bar∣barous. Even with all that command over nature which these confer, many ages elapse, before in∣dustry becomes so regular as to render subsistence secure, before the arts which supply the wants and furnish the accommodations of life, are brought to any considerable degree of perfection, and before any idea is conceived of various institutions requisite in a well-ordered society. The Mexicans and Pe∣ruvians, without knowledge of the useful metals, or the aid of domestic animals, laboured under disad∣vantages which must have greatly retarded their progress, and in their highest state of improvement their power was so limited, and their operations so feeble, that they can hardly be considered as having advanced beyond the infancy of civil life.</P>

But our acquaintance with its laws and manners is not, from that circumstance, more complete. What I have remarked concerning the defective and inaccurate information on which we must rely with respect to the condition and customs of the savage tribes in America, may be applied likewise to our knowledge of the Mexican empire. Cortes, and the rapacious adventurers who accompanied him, had not leisure or capacity to enrich either civil or natural history with new observations. They undertook their expedition in quest of one object, and seemed hardly to have turned their eyes to∣wards any other. Or, if during some short inter∣val of tranquillity, when the occupations of war ceased, and the ardour of plunder was suspended, the institutions and manners of the people whom they had invaded drew their attention, the inquiries of illiterate soldiers were conducted with so little sagacity and precision, that the accounts given by them of the policy and order established in the Mexican monarchy are superficial, confused, and in∣explicable. It is rather from indicents which they relate occasionally, than from their own deductions and remarks, that we are enabled to form some idea of the genius and manners of that people. The obscurity in which the ignorance of its conquerors involved the annals of Mexico, was augmented by the superstition of those who succeeded them. As the memory of past events was preserved among the Mexicans by figures painted on skins, on cotton cloth, on a kind of pasteboard, or on the bark of trees, the early missionaries, unable to comprehend their meaning, and struck with their uncouth forms,
<PB N="273" REF="034476_0780_0FFDDC202CDDA820"/>
conceived them to be monuments of idolatry which ought to be destroyed, in order to facilitate the con∣version of the Indians. In obedience to an edict issued by Juan de Zummaraga, a Franciscan monk, the first bishop of Mexico, as many records of the ancient Mexican story as could be collected were committed to the flames. In consequence of this fanatical zeal of the monks who first visited New Spain (which their successors soon began to la∣ment), whatever knowledge of remote events such rude monuments contained was almost entirely lost, and no information remained concerning the an∣cient revolutions and policy of the empire, but what was derived from tra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ition, or from some frag∣ments of their historical paintings that escaped the barbarous researches of Zummaraga<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acosta, lib. vi. c. 7. Torquem. Proem. lib. ii. lib. iii. c. 6. lib. xiv. c. 6.</NOTE>. From the experience of all nations it is manifest, that the me∣mory of past transactions can neither be long pre∣served, nor be transmitted with any fidelity, by tradition. The Mexican paintings, which are sup∣posed to have served as annals of their empire, are few in number, and of ambiguous meaning. Thus, amidst the uncertainty of the former, and the ob∣scurity of the latter, we must glean what intelligence can be collected from the scanty materials scattered in the Spanish writers<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">In the first edition, I observed that in consequence of the destruction of the ancient Mexican paintings, occasioned by the zeal of Zummaraga, whatever knowledge they might have con∣veyed was <HI>entirely</HI> lost. Every candid reader must have per∣ceived that the expression was inaccurate; as in a few lines afterwards I mention some ancient paintings to be still extant. M. Clavigero, not satisfied with laying hold of this inaccuracy, which I corrected in the subsequent editions, labours to render is more glaring, by the manner in which he quotes the remain∣ing part of the sentence. He reprehends with great asperity the account which I gave of the scanty materials for writing the an∣cient history of Mexico Vol. I Account of Writers, p. xxvi. Vol. II, 380. My words, however, are almost the same with those of Torquemada, who seems to have been better acquaint∣ed with the ancient monuments of the Mexicans than any Spa∣nish author whose works I have seen. Lib. xiv. c. 6. M. Clavigero himself gives a description of the destruction of anci∣ent paintings in almost the same terms that I have used; and mentions, as an additional reason of there being so small a num∣ber of ancient paintings known to the Spaniards, that the natives have become so solicitous to preserve and conceal them, that it is <Q>difficult, if not impossible, to make them part with one of them.</Q> Vol. I. 4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7. II. 194. No point can be more ascertained than that few of the Mexican historical paintings have been preserved. Though several Spaniards have carried on inquiries into the antiquities of the Mexican empire, no engrav∣ings from Mexican paintings have been communicated to the public, except those by Purchas, Gemelli Carreri, and Loren∣zana. It affords me some satisfaction, that in the course of my researches, I have discovered two collections of Mexican paint∣ings which were unknown to former inquirers. The cut which I published is an exact copy of the original, and gives no high idea of the progress which the Mexicans had made in the art of paint∣ing. I cannot conjecture what could induce M. Clavigero to ex∣press some dissatisfaction with me for having published it without the same colours it has in the original painting. p. xxix. He might have recollected, that neither Purchas, nor Gemelli Carreri, nor Lorenzana, thought it necessary to colour the prints which they have published, and they have never been censured on that ac∣count. He may rest assured, that though the colours in the paintings in the Imperial Library are remarkably bright, they are laid on without art, and without <Q>any of that regard to light and shade, or the rules of perspective,</Q> which M. Cla∣vigero requires. V. II. 378. If the public express any desire to have the seven paintings still in my possession engraved, I am ready to communicate them. The print published by Gemelli Carreri, of the route of the ancient Mexicans when they travelled towards the lake on which they built the capital of their empire, Churchill, Vol. IV. p. 481, is the most finished monument of art brought from the New World, and yet a very slight inspection of it will satisfy every one, that the annals of a nation conveyed in this manner must be very meagre and imperfect.</NOTE>.</P>

rather than peopled, by small independent tribes, whose mode of life and manners resembled those of the rudest savages which we have de∣scribed. But about a period correspon<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing to the beginning of the tenth century in the Christian aera, several tribes moved in successive migrations from unknown regions towards the north and north-west, and settled in different provinces of <HI>Anahuac,</HI> the ancient name of New-Spain. These, more civilized than the original inhabitants, began to form them to the arts o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> social life. At length, towards the commencement of the thirteenth cen∣tury, the Mexicans, a people more polished than any of the former, advanced from the border of the Californian gulf, and took possession of the plains adjacent to the great lake near the centre of the country. After residing there about fifty years, they founded a town, since distinguished by the name of <HI>Mexico,</HI> which from humble beginnings soon grew to be the most considerable city in the New World. The Mexicans, long after they were established in their new possessions, continued, like other martial tribes in America, unacquainted with regal dominion, and were governed in peace, and conducted in war, by such as were entitled to pre∣eminence by their wisdom or their valour. But among them, as in other states whose power and territories become extensive, the supreme authority centered at last in a single person; and when the Spaniards under Cortes invaded the country, Mon∣tezuma was the ninth monarch in order who had swayed the Mexican sceptre, not by hereditary right, but by election.</P>

If, on one hand, we suppose the Mexican state to have been of higher antiquity, and to have sub∣sisted during such a length of time as the Spanish accounts of its civilization would naturally lead us to conclude, it is difficult to conceive how, among a people who possessed the art of recording events by pictures, and who considered it as an essential part of their national education, to teach their children to repeat the historical songs which cele∣brated the exploits of their ancestors<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. ii. c. 18.</NOTE>, the know∣ledge of past trans<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ctions should be so slender and limited. If, on the other hand, we adopt their own system with respect to the antiquities of their nation, it is no less difficult to account either for that improved state of society, or for the extensive dominion to which their empire had attained when first visited by the Spaniards. The infancy of na∣tions is so long, and, even when every circumstance is favourable to their progress, they advance so slowly towards any maturity of strength or policy, that the recent origin of the Mexicans seems to be a strong presumption of some exaggeration, in the splendid descriptions which have been given of their government and manners.</P>

collecting those which must regulate our opinion in the present inquiry, some occur that suggest an idea of considerable progress in civilization in the Mexican empire, and others which seem to indi∣cate that it had advanced but little beyond the sa∣vage tribes aroun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it. Both shall be exhibited to the view of the reader, that, from comparing them, he may determine on which side the evidence pre∣ponderates.</P>
<P>IN the Mexican empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The right of property <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lly esta∣blished.</NOTE> the right of private pro∣perty was perfectly understood, and established in its full extent. Among several savage tribes, we have seen, that the idea of a title to the separate and exclusive possession of any object was hardly known; and that among all, it was extremely limited and ill-defined. But in Mexico, where agriculture and industry had made some progress, the distinction be∣tween property in land and property in goods had taken place. Both might be transferred from one person to another by sale or barter; both might de∣scend by inheritance. Every person who could be denominated a freeman had property in land. This, however, they held by various tenures. Some pos∣sessed it in full right, and it descended to their heirs. The title of others to their lands was derived from the office or dignity which they enjoyed; and when deprived of the latter, they lost possession of the former. Both these modes of occupying land were deemed noble, and peculiar to citizens of the highest class. The tenure, by which the great body of the people held their property, was very different. In every district a certain quantity of land was measured out in proportion to the num∣ber of families. This was cultivated by the joint labour of the whole; its produce was deposited in a common storehouse, and divided among them according to their respective exigencies. The
<PB N="278" REF="034476_0785_0FFDDC2FA60D0EF0"/>
members of the <HI>Calpulle,</HI> or associations, could not alienate their share of the common estate; it was an indivisible permanent property, destined for the support of their families<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. iv. c. 15. Torquem. Mon. Ind. lib. xiv. c. 7. Corita, MS.</NOTE>. In consequence of this distribution of the territory of the state, every man had an interest in its welfare, and the happi∣ness of the individual was connected with the pub∣lic security.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The num∣ber and greatness of their cities.</NOTE>ANOTHER striking circumstance, which distin∣guishes the Mexican empire from those nations in America we have already described, is the num∣ber and greatness of its cities. While society con∣tinues in a rude state, the wants of men are so few, and they stand so little in need of mutual as∣sistance, that their inducements to crowd together are extremely feeble. Their in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ustry at the same time is so imperfect, that it cannot secure subsist∣ence for any considerable number of families set∣tled in one spot. They live dispersed, at this pe∣riod, from choice as well as from necessity, or at the utmost assemble in small hamlets on the banks of the river which supplies them with food, or on the border of some plain left open by nature, or cleared by their own labour. The Spaniards, ac∣customed to this mode of habitation among all the savage tribes with which they were hitherto ac∣quainted, were astonished, on entering New Spain, to find the natives residing in towns of such extent as resembled those of Europe. In the first fervour of their admiration, they compared Zempoalla, though a town only of the second or third size, to the ci∣ties of greatest note in their own country. When, afterwards, they visited in succession Tlascala, Cho∣lula, Tacuba, Tezeuco, and Mexico itself, their
<PB N="279" REF="034476_0786_0FFDDC3142CE5A70"/>
amazement increased so much, that it led them to convey i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eas of their magnitude and populousness bordering on what is incredible. Even when there is leisure for observation, and no interest that leads to deceive, conjectural estimates of the num∣ber of people in cities are extremely loose, and usually much exaggerated. It is not surprising, then, that Cortes and his companions, little ac∣customed to such computations, and powerfully tempted to magnify, in order to exalt the merit of their own discoveries and conquests, should have been betrayed into this common error, and have raised their descriptions considerably above truth. For this reason, some considerable abatement ought to be ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e from their calculations of the number of inhabitants in the Mexican cities, and we may fix the standard of their population much lower than they have done; but still they will appear to be cities of such consequence, as are not to be found but among people who have made some considerable progress in the arts of social life<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XLIX.</NOTE>. From their accounts, we can hardly suppose Mexi∣co, the capital of the empire, to have contained few∣er than sixty thousand inhabitants.</P>
<P>THE separation of professions among the Mexi∣cans is a symptom of improvement no less remark∣able. Arts, in the early ages of society,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The sepa∣ration of professions.</NOTE> are so few and so simple, that each man is sufficiently master of them all, to gratify every demand of his own limited desires. The savage can form his bow, point his arrows, rear his hut, and hollow his ca∣noe without calling in the aid of any hand more skilful than his own. Time must have augmented the wants of men, and ripened their ingenuity, be∣fore the productions of art became so complicated

in their structure, or so curious in their fabric, that a particular course of education was requisite to∣wards forming the artificer to expertness in con∣trivance and workmanship. In proportion as re∣finement spreads, the distinction of professions in∣creases, and they branch out into more numerous and minute subdivisions. Among the Mexican<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this separation of the arts necessary in life had take<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> place to a considerable extent. The functions of the mason, the weaver, the goldsmith, the painter, and of several other crafts, were carried on by dif∣ferent persons. Each was regularly instructed in his calling. To it alone his industry was confined; and by assiduous application to one object, together with the persevering patience peculiar to Ameri∣cans, their artizans attained to a degree of neatness and perfection in work, far beyond what could have been expected from the rude tools which they em∣ployed. Their various productions were brought into commerce; and by the exchange of them in the stated markets held in the cities, not only were their mutual wants supplied<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. ap.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The dis∣tinction of ranks.</NOTE>THE distinction of ranks established in the Mexi∣can empire is the next circumstance that merits attention. In surveying the savage tribes of Ame∣rica, we observed, that consciousness of equality, and impatience of subordination, are sentiments na∣tural to man in the infancy of civil life. During peace, the authority of a superior is hardly felt among them, and even in war it is but little ac∣knowledged. Strangers to the idea of property,
<PB N="281" REF="034476_0788_0FFDDC37C4809680"/>
the difference in condition resulting from the ine∣quality of it is unknown. Birth or titles confer no pre-eminence; it is only by personal merit and accomplishments that distinction can be acquired. The form of society was very different among the Mexicans. The great body of the people was in a most humiliating state. A considerable number, known by the name of <HI>Mayeques,</HI> nearly resembling in condition those peasants who, under various de∣nominations, were considered, during the prevalence of the feudal system, as instruments of labour at∣tached to the soil. The <HI>Mayeques</HI> could not change their place of residence without permission of the superior on whom they depended. They were conveyed, together with the lands on which they were settled, from one proprietor to another; and were bound to cultivate the ground, and to per∣form several kinds of servile work<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. iv. c. 17. Corita, MS.</NOTE>. Others were reduced to the lowest form of subjection, that of do∣mestic servitude, and felt the utmost rigour of that wretched state. Their condition was held to be so vile, and their lives deemed to be of so little value, that a person who killed one of these slaves was not subjected to any punishment<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. iv. c. 7.</NOTE>. Even those considered as freemen were treate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by their haughty lords as beings of an inferior species. The nobles, possessed of ample territories, were divided into various classes, to each of which peculiar titles of honour belonged. Some of these titles, like their lands, descended from father to son in perpetual succession. Others were annexed to particular of∣fices, or conferred during life as marks of personal distinction<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3 lib. iv. c. 15. Corita, MS.</NOTE>.

the distinction of ranks were completely established, in a line of regular subordination, reaching from the highest to the lowest member of the commu∣nity. Each of these knew what he could claim, and what he owed. The people, who were not allowed to wear a dress of the same fashion, or to dwell in houses of a form similar to those of the nobles, ac∣costed them with the most submissive reverence. In the presence of their sovereign, they durst not lift their eyes from the ground, or look him in the face<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. ii. c. 14.</NOTE>. The nobles themselves, when admitted to an audience of their sovereign, entered bare-footed, in mean garments, and, as his slaves, paid him ho∣mage approaching to adoration. This respect due from inferiors to those above them in rank, was prescribed with such ceremonious accuracy, that it incorporated with the language, and influenced its genius and idiom. The Mexican tongue abounded in expressions of reverence and courtesy. The stile and appellations, used in the intercourse between equals, would have been so unbecoming in the mouth of one in a lower sphere, when he accosted a person in higher rank, as to be deemed an insult<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE L.</NOTE>.

they represent the monarchs of Mexico as absolute, deciding according to their pleasure, with respect to every operation of the state. On other occasions we discover the traces of established customs and laws, framed in order to circumscribe the power of the crown, and we meet with rights and privileges of the nobles which seem to be op∣posed as barriers against its encroachments. This appearance of inconsistency has arisen from inat∣tention to the innovations of Montezuma upon the Mexican policy. His aspiring ambition subverted the original system of government, and introduced a pure despotism. He disregarded the ancient laws, violated the privileges hel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> most sacred, and reduced his subjects of every order to the level of slaves<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. ii. c. 14. Torquem, lib. ii. c. 69.</NOTE>. The chiefs, or nobles of the first rank, submitted to the yoke with such reluctance, that, from impatience to shake it off, and hope of re∣covering their rights, many of them courted the protection of Cortes, and joined a foreign power against their domestic oppressor<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. v. c. 10, 11.

It is not then under the dominion of Montezuma, but under the government of his predecessors, that we can dis∣cover what was the original form and genius of Mexican policy. From the foundation of the mo∣narchy to the election of Montezuma, it seems to have subsisted with little variation.

what he relates, there were in the Mexican empire thirty of this order, each of whom had in his territories about an hundred thousand peo∣ple, and subordinate to these, there were about three thousand nobles of a lower class<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. viii. c. 12.</NOTE>.

But all followed the stand∣ard of Mexico in war, serving with a number of men in proportion to their domain, and most of them pain tribute to its monarch as their superior lord.</P>
<P>IN tracing those great lines of the Mexican con∣stitution, an image of feudal policy, in its most rigid form, rises to view, and we discern its three distinguishing characteristics, a nobility possessing almost independent authority, a people depressed into the lowest state of subjection, and a king en∣trusted with the executive power of the state. Its spirit and principles seem to have operated in the New World in the same manner as in the ancient. The jurisdiction of the crown as extremely limited. All real and effective authority was retained by the Mexican nobles in their own hands, and the shadow of it only left to the king. Jealous to excess of their own rights, they guarded with the most vigi∣lant anxiety against the encroachments of their so∣vereigns. By a fundamental law of the empire, it was provided that the king should not determine concerning any point of general importance, with∣out the approbation of a council composed of the

Unless he obtained their consent he could not engage the nation in war, nor could he dispose of the most considerable branch of the public revenue at pleasure; it was appropriated to certain purposes from which it could not be di∣verted by the regal authority alone<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. iv. c. 17.</NOTE>. In order to secure full effect to those constitutional restraints, the Mexican nobles did not permit their crown to descend by inheritance, but disposed of it by election. The right of election seems to have been originally vested in the whole body of nobility, but was after∣wards committed to six electors, of whom the Chiefs of Tezeuco and Tacuba were always two. From respect for the family of their monarchs, the choice fell generally upon some person sprung from it. But as the activity and valour of their prince were of greater moment to a people perpetually en∣gaged in war, than a strict adherence to the order of birth, collaterals of mature age or of distin∣guished merit were often preferred to those who were nearer the throne in direct descent<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Acosta, lib. vi. c. 24. Herrera, dec. 3. lib. ii. c. 13. Corita, MS.</NOTE>. To this maxim in their policy, the Mexicans appear to be indebted for such a succession of able and warlike princes, as raised their empire in a short period to that extraordinary height of power which it had attained when Cortes landed in New Spain.</P>
<P>WHILE the jurisdiction of the Mexican monarchs continued to be limited,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Power and splendour of their mo∣narchs.</NOTE> it is probable that it was exercised with little ostentation.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Order of their go∣vernment.</NOTE>BUT it was not in the mere parade of royalty that the Mexican potentates exhibited their power, they manifested it more beneficially in the order and regularity with which they conducted the in∣ternal administration and police of their dominions.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Provision for the support of it.</NOTE>THEIR attention in providing for the support of government was not less sagacious.

As the use of money was unknown, all the taxes were paid in kind, and thus not only the natural productions of all the different pro∣vinces in the empire, but every species of manufac∣ture, and every work of ingenuity and art, were collected in the public store-houses. From those the emperor supplied his numerous train of attend∣ants in peace, and his armies during war, with food, with clothes, and ornaments.

They represented men, animals, and other objects, by such a disposition of various coloured feathers, as is said to have pro∣duced all the effects of light and shade, and to have imitated nature with truth and delicacy. Their ornaments of gold and silver have been described to be of a fabrick no less curious. But in forming any idea, from general descriptions, concerning the state of arts among nations imperfectly polished, we are extremely ready to err. In examining the works of people whose advances in improvement are nearly the same with our own, we view them with a critical, and often with a jealous eye. Whereas, when conscious of our own superiority, we survey the arts of nations comparatively rude, we are astonished at works executed by them un∣der such manifest disadvantages, and, in the warmth of our admiration, are apt to represent them as productions more finished than they really are. To the influence of this allusion, without supposing any intention to deceive, we may impute the exag∣geration of some Spanish authors, in their accounts of Mexican arts.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="034476_0796_0FFDDC4C028781B8"/>IT is not from those descriptions, but from con∣sidering such specimens of their arts as are still pre∣served, that we must decide concerning their de∣gree of merit. As the ship in which Cortes sent to Charles V. the most curious productions of the Mexican artisans, which were collected by the Spaniards when they first pillaged the empire, was taken by a French corsair<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Relat. de Cort. Ramus. iii. 294, F.</NOTE>, the remains of their ingenuity are less numerous than those of the Pe∣ruvians. Whether any of their works with fea∣thers, in imitation of painting, be still extant in Spain, I have not learned; but many of their or∣naments in gold and silver, as well as various utensils employed in common life, are deposited in the magnificent cabinet of natural and artificial productions, lately opened by the king of Spain; and I am informed by persons on whose judgment and taste I can rely, that these boasted efforts of their art are uncouth representations of common ob∣jects, or very coarse images of the human and some other forms, destitute of grace and propriety<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LIII.</NOTE>. The justness of these observations is confirmed by inspecting the wooden prints and copper-plates of their paintings, which have been published by va∣rious authors. In them every figure of men, of quadrupeds, or birds, as well as every representa∣tion of inanimated nature, is extremely rude and awkward<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">As a specimen of the spirit and stile in which M.

My information concerning the Mexican works of art deposited in the King of Spain's cabinet▪ was received from the late Lord Grantham, ambassador extraordinary from the court of London to that of Madrid, and from Mr. Arch∣deacon Waddilove▪ chaplain to the embassy; and it was upon their authority that I pronounced the coat of armour, men∣tioned in the note, to be of Oriental fabric. As they were both at Madrid in their public character when the first edi∣tion of the History of America was published, I thought it improper at that time to mention their names. Did their decision concerning a matter of taste, or their testimony con∣cerning a point of fact stand in need of confirmation, I might produce the evidence of an intelligent traveller, who in de∣scribing the royal cabinet of Madrid, takes notice that it con∣tains "specimens of Mexican and Peruvian utensils, vases, &amp;c. in earthen-ware, wretched both in taste and execution."

As Gage composed his <HI>Survey of New Spain</HI> with all the zeal and acrimony of a new convert, I have paid little regard to his testimony with respect to points relating to religion. But as he resided in several provinces in New Spain, which travellers seldom visit, and as he seems to have observed their manners and laws with an intelligent eye, I have availed myself of his information with respect to mat∣ters where religious opinion could have little influence. Correal I have seldom quoted, and never rested upon his evidence alone. The station in which Ibagnez was employed in America as well as the credit given to his veracity by printing his Regno Jesuitico among the large collection of documents published (as I believe by authority) at Madrid, A. D. 1767, justifies me for appealing to his authority.</NOTE>. The hardest Egyptian style, stiff and

<P><PB N="291" REF="034476_0798_0FFDDC5139C152F8"/>BUT however low the Mexican paintings may be ranked, when viewed merely as works of art, a very different station belongs to them, when con∣sidered as the records of their country, as historical monuments of its policy and transactions; and they become curious as well as interesting objects of attention. The noblest and most beneficial inven∣tion of which human ingenuity can boast, is that of writing. But the first essays of this art, which hath contributed more than all others to the im∣provement of the species were very rude, and it advanced towards perfection slowly, and by a gra∣dual progression. When the warrior, eager for fame, wished to transmit some knowledge of his exploits to succeeding ages; when the gratitude of a people to their sovereign prompted them to hand down an account of his beneficent deeds to poste∣rity; the first method of accomplishing this, which seems to have occurred to them, was to delineate, in the best manner they could, figures representing the action of which they were solicitous to preserve the memory.

<P><PB N="292" REF="034476_0799_0FFDDC52EC342980"/>COMPARED with those awkward essays of their savage countrymen, the paintings of the Mexicans may be considered as works of composition and de∣sign. They were not acquainted, it is true, with any other method of recording transactions, than that of delineating the objects which they wished to represent. But they could exhibit a more com∣plex series of events in progressive order, and de∣scribe, by a proper <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>isposition of figures, the oc∣currences of a king's reign from his accession to his death; the progress of an infant's education from its birth until it attain to the years of ma∣turity; the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ifferent recompences and marks of distinction conferred upon warriors, in proportion to the exploits which they ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> performed. Some singular specimens of this picture-writing have been preserved, which are justly consi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ered as the most curious monuments of art brought from the New World. The most valuable of these was published by Purchas in sixty-six plates. It is di∣vided into three parts. The first contains the history of the Mexican empire under its ten mo∣narchs. The second is a tribute-roll, representing what each conquered town paid into the royal treasury. The third is a code of their institutions, domestic, political, and military. Another speci∣men of Mexican painting has been published in thirty-two plates, by the present archbishop of Toledo. To both are annexed a full explanation of what the figures were intended to represent, which was obtained by the Spaniards from Indians well acquainted with their own arts. The style of painting in all these is the same. They represent <HI>things,</HI> not <HI>words.</HI> They exhibit images to the eye, not ideas to the understanding. They may, therefore, be considered as the earliest and most imperfect essay of men in their progress towards
<PB N="293" REF="034476_0800_0FFDDC54DB33E1E8"/>
discovering the art of writing. The defects in this mode of recording transactions must have been early felt. To paint every occurrence was from its nature, a very te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ious operation; and as affairs became more complicated, and events multiplied in any society, its annals must have swelled to an enormous bulk. Besides this, no objects could be delineated but those of sense; the conceptions of the mind had no corporeal form, and as long as picture-writing could not convey an i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea of these, it must have been a very imperfect art. The ne∣cessity of improving it must have rouzed and sharp∣ened invention, and the human mind holding the same course in the New World as in in the Old, might have advanced by the same successive steps, first, from an actual picture to the plain hierogly∣phic; next, to the allegorical symbol; then to the arbitrary character; until, at length, an alphabet of letters was discovered, capable of expressing all the various combinations of sound employed in speech. In the paintings of the Mexicans we, ac∣cordingly, perceive, that this progress was begun among them. Upon an attentive inspection of the plates, which I have mentioned, we may observe some approach to the plain or simple hieroglyphic, where some principal part or circumstance in the subject is made to stand for the whole. In the an∣nals of their kings, published by Purchas, the towns conquered by each are uniformly represented in the same manner by a rude delineation of a house; but in order to point out the particular towns which submitted to their victorious arms, peculiar emblems, sometimes natural objects, and sometimes artificial figures, are employed. In the tribute-roll published by the archbishop of To∣ledo, the house which was properly the picture of the town, is omitted, and the emblem alone is em∣ployed
<PB N="294" REF="034476_0801_0FFDDC5A9AC71658"/>
to represent it. The Mexicans seem even to have made some advances beyond this, to∣wards the use of the more figurative and fanciful hieroglyphic. In order to describe a monarch, who had enlarged his dominions by force of arms, they painted a target ornamented with arts, and placed it between him and those towns which he subdued. But it is only in one instance, the no∣tation of numbers, that we discern any attempt to exhibit ideas which had no corporeal form. The Mexican painters had invented artificial marks, or <HI>signs of convention,</HI> for this purpose. By means of these, they computed the years of their kings' reigns, as well as the amount of tribute to be paid into the royal treasury. The figure of a circle represented unit, and in small numbers, the computation was made by repeating it. Larger numbers were expressed by a peculiar mark, and they had such as denoted all integral numbers, from twenty to eight thousand. The short dura∣tion of their empire prevented the Mexicans from advancing farther in that long course which con∣ducts men from the labour of delineating real ob∣jects, to the simplicity and ease of alphabetic writing. Their records, notwithstanding some dawn of such ideas as might have led to a more perfect style, can be considered as little more than a species of picture-writing, so far improved as to mark their superiori∣ty over the the savage tribes of America; but still so defective, as to prove that they had not proceed∣ed far beyond the first stage in that progress which must be completed before any people can be ranked among polished nations <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LIV.</NOTE>.</P>

in improvement. They divided their year into eighteen months, each consisting of twenty days, amounting in all to three hundred and sixty. But as they observed that the course of the sun was not completed in that time, they added five days to the year. These, which were properly intercalary days, they termed <HI>supernumerary</HI> or <HI>waste;</HI> and as they did not belong to any month, no work was done, and no sacred rite performed on them; they were devoted wholly to festivity and pastime <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acosta, lib. vi. c. 2.</NOTE>.

They fought, in order to gratify their vengeance, by shedeing the blood of their enemies.

<PB N="296" REF="034476_0803_0FFDDC5DE8C491B8"/>
sacrificed without mercy, and their flesh devoured with the same barbarous joy as among the fiercest savages. On some occasions it rose to even wilder excesses. Their principal warriors covered them∣selves with the skins of the unhappy victims, and danced about the streets, boasting of their own va∣lour, and exulting over their enemies <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. ii. c. 15.

This ferocity of character prevailed among all the nations of New Spain. The Tlas∣calans, the people of Mechoacan, and other states at enmity with the Mexicans, delighted equally in war, and treated their prisoners with the same cruelty. In proportion as mankind combined in social union, and live under the influence of equal laws and regular policy, their manners soften, sen∣timents of humanity arise, and the rights of the species come to be understood. The fierceness of war abates, and even while engaged in hostility, men remember what they owe one to another. The savage fights to destroy, the citizen to conquer. The former neither pities nor spares, the latter has acquired sensibility which tempers his rage. To this sensibility the Mexicans seem to have been per∣fect strangers, and among them war was carried on with so much of its original barbarity, that we can∣not but suspect their degree of civilization to have been very imperfect.</P>

Such a remark could hardly have been made with respect to any people furnished plentifully with the necessaries of life. The difficulty which Cortes found in procuring subsistence for his small body of soldiers, who were often constrained to live on the spontaneous productions of the earth, seems to confirm the remark of the Spanish writers, and gives no high idea of the state of cultivation in the Mexican empire<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Relat. ap.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Doubts concerning the extent of the em∣pire.</NOTE>THE vast extent of the Mexican empire, which has been considered, and with justice, as the most decisive proof of a considerable progress in regular government and police, is one of those facts in the history of the New World which seems to have been admitted without due examination or suffi∣cient evidence. The Spanish historians, in order to magnify the valour of their countrymen, are ac∣customed to represent the dominion of Montezuma as stretching over all the provinces of New Spain from the northern to the Southern Ocean. But a great part of the mountainous country was possessed by the <HI>Otomies,</HI> a fierce uncivilized peo∣ple, who seem to have been the residue of the ori∣ginal inhabitants. The provinces towards the north and west of Mexico were occupied by the <HI>Chiche∣mecas,</HI> and other tribes of hunters. None of these recognized the Mexican monarch as their superior. Even in the interior and more level country, there were several cities and provinces which had never submitted to the Mexican yoke. Tlascala, though only twenty-one leagues from the capital of the empire, was an independent and hostile republic. Cholula, though still nearer, had been subjected only a short time before the arrival of the Spa∣niards. Tepeaca, at the distance of thirty leagues from Mexico, seems to have been a separate state, governed by its own laws<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. x. c. 15.21. B. Diaz, c. 130.</NOTE>. Mechoucan, the fron∣tier of which extended within forty leagues of Mexi∣co, was a powerful kingdom, remarkable for its

implacable enmity to the Mexican name <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. ii. c. 10.</NOTE>. By these hostile powers the Mexican empire was cir∣cumscribed on every quarter, and the high ideas which we are apt to form of it from the description of the Spanish historians, should be considerably moderated.</P>
<P>IN consequence of this independence of several states in New Spain upon the Mexican empire,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little in∣tercourse a∣mong its several pro∣vinces.</NOTE> there was not any considerable intercourse between its various provinces. Even in the interior coun∣try not far distant from the capital, there seem to have been no roads to facilitate the communication of one district with another; and when the Spa∣niards first attempted to penetrate into its several provinces, they had to open their way through forests and marshes<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">B. Diaz, c. 166. c. 176.</NOTE>. Cortes, in his adventurous march from Mexico to Honduras in 1525, met with obstructions, and endured hardships, little inferior to those with which he must have struggled in the most uncivilized regions of America. In some places he could hardly force a passage through impervious woods, and plains overflowed with water. In others he found so little cultivation, that his troops were frequently in danger of perishing by famine. Such facts correspond ill with the pompous description which the Spanish writers give of Mexican police and industry, and convey an idea of a country nearly similar to that possessed by the Indian tribes in North America. Here and there a trading or a war path, as they are called in North America, led from one settlement to another<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 3. lib. vii. c. 8.</NOTE>, but generally there appeared no sign of any established communica∣tion, few marks of industry, and fewer monuments of art.</P>

The discovery of this is among the steps of greatest consequence in the progress of nations. Until it has been made, all their transactions must be so awkward, so ope∣ro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and so limited, that we may boldly pronounce that they have advanced but a little way in their career. The invention of such a commercial standard is of such high antiquity in our hemi∣sphere, and rises so far beyond the aera of authen∣tic history, as to appear almost coeval with the ex∣istence of society. The precious metals seem to have been early employed for this purpose, and from their permanent value, their divisibility, and many other qualities, they are better adapted to serve as a common standard than any other substance of which nature has given us the command. But in the New World, where these metals abound most, this use of them was not known. The exigencies of ru<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e tribes, or of monarchies imperfectly civi∣lized, did not call for it. All their commercial in∣tercourse was carried on by barter, and their igno∣rance of any common standard by which to facili∣tate that exchange of commodities which contri∣butes so much towards the comfort of life, may be justly mentioned as an evidence of the infant state of their policy. But even in the New Word the inconveniance of wanting some general instrument of commerce began to be felt, and some efforts were made towards supplying that defect. The Mexicans, among whom the number and greatness of their c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>s gave rise to a more extende<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> com∣merce than in any other part of America, had began to employ a common standard of value, which ren∣dered smaller transactions much more easy.

chocolate was the favourite drink of persons in every rank of life, the nuts or almonds of cocao, of which it is composed, were of such universal consumption, that, in their stated markets, these were willingly received in return for commodities of small pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>. Thus they came to be considered as the instrument of commence, and the value of what one wished to dispose of was estimated by the number of nuts of the cacao, which he might ex∣pect in exchange for it.

And if the want of it is to be held, on one hand, as a proof of their barbarity, this expedient for supplying that want, should be admitted on the other, as an evidence no less satis∣fying, of some progress which the Mexicans had made in refinement and civilization, beyond the savage tribes around them.</P>
<P>IN such a rude state were many of the Mexican provinces when first visited by their conquerors.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Doubts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ning the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of their cities.</NOTE> Even their cities, extensive and populous as they were, seem more fit to be the habitation of men just emerging from barbarity, than the residence of a polished people.

Its base on each side extended ninety feet, and decreasing gradually as it advanced in height, it terminated in a quadrangle of about thirty feet, where were placed a shrine of the deity, and two altars on which the victims were sacri∣ficed <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 2. lib. vii. c. 17.</NOTE>.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and other public buildings.</NOTE>GREATER skill and ingenuity were displayed, if we may believe the Spanish historians, in the houses of the emperor and in those of the principal no∣bility. There, some elegance of design was vi∣sible, and a commodious arrangement of the apart∣ments was attended to. But if buildings corre∣sponding to such descriptions had ever existed in the Mexican cities, it is probable that some re∣mains of them would still be visible. From the manner in which Cortes conducted the siege of Mexico, we can indeed easily account for the total destruction of whatever had any appearance of splendour in that capital. But as only two centuries
<PB N="303" REF="034476_0810_0FFDDC7A0D5B47F0"/>
and a half have elapsed since the conquest of New Spain, it seems altogether incredible that in a pe∣riod <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o short, every vestige of this boasted elegance and grandeur should have disappeared; and that in the other cities, particularly in those which did not suffer by the destructive hand of the conquerors, there are any ruins, which can be considered as mo∣numents of their ancient magnificence.</P>
<P>EVEN in a village of the rudest Indians, there are buildings of greater extent and elevation than common dwelling-houses. Such as are destined for holding the council of the tribe, and in which all assemble on occasions of public festivity, may be called stately edifices, when compared with the rest. As among the Mexicans the distinction of rank was established, and property was unequally divided, the number of distinguished structures in their towns would of course be greater than in other parts of America. But these seem not to have been either so solid or magnificent as to merit the pompous epithets which some Spanish authors employ in describing them. It is probable that, though more ornamented, and built on a larger scale, they were erected with the same slight mate∣rials which the Indians employed in their common buildings<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LVII.</NOTE>, and time, in a space much less than two hundred and fifty years, may have swept away all re∣them<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LVIII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>FROM this enumeration of facts, it seems, upon the whole, to be evident, that the state of society in Mexico was considerably advanced beyond that of the savage tri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>s which we have delineated.

frequent or a more fertile source of deception in de∣scribing the manners and arts of savage nations, or of such as are imperfectly civilized, than that of ap∣plying to them the names and phrases appropriated to the institutions and refinements of polished life. When the leader of a small tribe, or the head of a rude community, is dignified with the name of king or emperor, the place of his residence can receive no other name but that of his palace; and whatever his attendants may be, they must be called his court. Under such appellations they acquire, in our estimation, an importance and dignity which does not belong to them. The illusion spreads, and giving a false colour to every part of the nar∣rative, the imagination is so much carried away with the resemblance, that it becomes difficult to discern objects as they really are. The Spaniards, when they first touched on the Mexican coast, were so much struck with the appearance of attain∣ments in policy and in the arts of li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, far superior to those of the rude tribes with which they were hitherto acquainted, that they fancied they had at length discovered a civilized people in the New World. This comparison between the people of Mexico and their uncultivated neighbours, they appear to have kept constantly in view, and ob∣serving with admiration many things which marked the pre-eminence of the former, they employ in describing their imperfect policy and infant arts, such terms as are applicable to the institutions of men far beyond them in improvement. Both these circumstances concur in detracting from the credit due to the descriptions of Mexican manners by the early Spanish writers. By drawing a parallel be∣tween them and those of people so much less civi∣lized, they raised their own ideas too high. By their mode of describing them, they conveyed
<PB N="305" REF="034476_0812_0FFDDC7F9030E1D8"/>
ideas to others no less exalted above truth. Later writers have adopted the style of the original histo∣rians, and improved upon it. The colours with which De Solis delineates the character, and de∣scribes the actions of Montezuma, the splendor of his court, the laws and policy of his empire, are the same that he must have employed in exhibiting to view the monarch and institutions of an highly polished people.</P>
<P>BUT though we may admit, that the warm ima∣gination of the Spanish writers has added some em∣bellishment to their descriptions, this will not justify the decisive and peremptory tone, with which se∣veral authors pronounce all their accounts of the Mexican power, policy and laws, to be the fictions of men who wished to deceive, or who delighted in the marvellous. There are few historical facts that can be ascertained by evidence more unex∣ceptionable, than may be produced in support of the material articles, in the description of the Mexican constitution and manners. Eye witnesses relate what they beheld. Men who had resided among the Mexicans, both before and after the conquest, describe institutions and customs which were familiar to them. Persons of professions so different that objects must have presented them∣selves to their view under every various aspect; soldiers, priests, and lawyers, all concur in their testimony. Had Cortes ventured to impose upon his sovereign, by exhibiting to him a picture of imaginary manners, there wanted not enemies and rivals who were qualified to detect his deceit, and who would have rejoiced in exposing it. But ac∣cording to the just remark of an author, whose in∣genuity has illustrated, and whose eloquence has adorned the history of America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. l'Abbe Raynal Hist. philos. &amp; polit. &amp;c. iii. 127.</NOTE>, this supposition
<PB N="306" REF="034476_0813_0FFDDC811F580470"/>
is in itself as improbable, as the attempt would have been audacious. Who among the destroyers of this great empire was so enlightened by science, or so attentive to the progress and operations of men in social life, as to frame a fictitious system of policy so well combined and so consistent, as that which they delineate, in their accounts of the Mexican government? Where could they have borrowed the idea of many institutions in legisla∣tion and police, to which, at that period, there was nothing parallel in the nations with which they were acquainted? There was not, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, a regular establishment of posts for conveying intelligence to the sovereign of any kingdom in Europe. The same observation will apply to what the Spaniards relate, with re∣spect to the structure of the city of Mexico, the regulations concerning its police, and various laws established for the administration of justice, or se∣curing the happiness of the community. Whoever is accustomed to contemplate the progress of na∣tions, will often, at very early stages of it, discover a premature and unexpected dawn of those ideas, which give rise to institutions that are the pride and ornament of its most advanced period. Even in a state as imperfectly polished as the Mexican empire, the happy genius of some sagacious ob∣server, excited or aided by circumstances unknown to us, may have introduced institutions which are seldom found but in societies highly refined. But it is almost impossible that the illiterate conquerors of the New World should have formed in any one instance a conception of customs and laws, beyond the standard of improvement in their own age and country. Or if Cortes had been capable of this, what inducement had those by whom he was superseded to continue the deception? Why should

Corita, or Motolinea, or Acosta, have amused their sovereign or their fellow-citizens with a tale purely fabulous?</P>
<P>IN one particular, however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Religion of the Mexi∣cans.</NOTE> the guides whom we must follow have represented the Mexicans to be more barbarous, perhaps, than they really were. Their religious tenets, and the rites of their wor∣ship, are described by them as wild and cruel in an extreme degree. Religion, which occupies no considerable place in the thoughts of a savage, whose conceptions of any superior power are ob∣scure, and his sacred rites few as well as simple, was formed, among the Mexicans, into a regular system, with its complete train of priests, temples, victims, and festivals. This, of itself, is a clear proof that the state of the Mexicans was very dif∣ferent from that of the ruder American tribes. But from the extravagance of their religious no∣tions, or the barbarity of their rites, no conclusion can be drawn with certainty concerning the degree of their civilization. For nations, long after their ideas begin to enlarge, and their manners to refine, adhere to systems of superstition founded on the crude conceptions of early ages. From the genius of the Mexican religion we may, however, form a most just conclusion with respect to its influence upon the character of the people. The aspect of superstition in Mexico was gloomy and atrocious. Its divinities were clothed with terror, and de∣lighted in vengeance. They were exhibited to the people under detestable forms, which created horror. The figures of serpents, of tygers, and of other destructive animals, decorated their temples. Fear was the only principle that inspired their vo∣taries. Fasts, mortifications, and penances, all ri∣gid, and many of them excruciating to an ex∣treme degree, were the means employed to appease
<PB N="308" REF="034476_0815_0FFDDC877026A518"/>
the wrath of their gods, and the Mexicans never approached their altars without sprinkling them with blood drawn from their own bodies. But, of all offerings, human sacrifices were deemed the most acceptable. This religious belief, mingling with the implacable spirit of vengeance, and adding new force to it, every captive taken in war was brought to the temple, was devoted as a victim to the deity, and sacrificed with rites no less solemn than cruel<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cortes Relat. ap Ramus. iii. 240, &amp;c.

The heart and head were the portion con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecrated to the gods; the warrior, by whose prowess the prisoner had been seized, carried off the body to feast upon it with his friends. Under the impression of ideas so dreary and terrible, and accustomed daily to scenes of bloodshed rendered awful by religion, the heart of man must harden and be steeled to every sentiment of humanity. The spirit of the Mexicans was accordingly un∣feeling, and the genius of their religion so far counterbalanced the influence of policy and arts, that notwithstanding their progress in both, their manners, instead of softening, became more fierce. To what circumstances it was owing that super∣stition assumed such a dreadful form among the Mexicans, we have not sufficient knowledge of their history to determine. But its influence is visible, and produced an effect that is singular in the history of the human species. The manners of the people in the New World who had made the greatest pro∣gress in the arts of policy, were, in several re∣spects, the most ferocious, and the barbarity of some of their customs exceeded even those of the savage state.</P>

account was taken, and a kind of register kept, of the inhabitants in each province, or of the several productions collected there for public use. But as by these knots, however varied or combined, no moral or abstract idea, no operation or quality of the mind could be represented, they contributed little towards preserving the memory of ancient events and institutions. By the Mexican paintings and symbols, rude as they were, more knowledge of remote transactions seems to have been con∣veyed, than the Peruvians could derive from their boasted quipos. Had the latter been even of more extensive use, and better adapted to supply the place of written records, they perished so generally, together with other monuments of Peruvian inge∣nuity, in the wreck occasioned by the Spanish con∣quest, and the civil wars subsequent to it, that no accession of light or knowledge comes from them. All the zeal of Garcilasso de la Vega, for the honour of that race of monarchs from whom he descended, all the industry of his researches, and the superior advantages with which he car∣ried them on, opened no source of information unknown to the Spanish authors who wrote before him.

interwoven in the system of their religion and po∣licy, as preserved the memory of them from being lost; and upon the description of such customs and institutions as continued in force at the time of the conquest, and fell under the immediate observation of the Spaniards. By attending carefully to these, and endeavouring to separate them from what ap∣pears to be fabulous, or of doubtful authority, I have laboured to form an idea of the Peruvian govern∣ment and manners.</P>
<P>THE people of Peru, as I have already observed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i. p. 21, &amp;c.</NOTE>,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Origin of their civil policy.</NOTE> had not advanced beyond the rudest form of savage life, when Manco Capac, and his consort Mama Ocollo, appeared to instruct and civilize them. Who these extraordinary personages were, whether they imported their system of legislation and knowledge of arts from some country more improved, or, if natives of Peru, how they acquired ideas so far su∣perior to those of the people whom they addressed, are circumstances with respect to which the Peru∣vian tradition conveys no information. Manco Capac and his consort, taking advantage of the propensity in the Peruvians to superstition, and par∣ticularly of their veneration for the Sun, pretended to be children of that glorious luminary, and to deliver their instructions in his name, and by au∣thority from him. The multitude listened and be∣lieved. What reformation in policy and manners the Peruvians ascribe to those founders of their empire, and how, from the precepts of the Inca and his consort, their ancestors gradually acquired some knowledge of those arts, and some relish for that industry, which render subsistence secure and life comfortable, hath been formerly related. Those blessings were originally confined within narrow precincts; but in process of time, the successors of
<PB N="312" REF="034476_0819_0FFDDC9228A6AD60"/>
Manco Capac extended their dominion over all the regions that stretch to the west of the Andes from Chili to Quito, establishing in every province their peculiar policy and religious institutions.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Founded in religion.</NOTE>THE most singular and striking circumstance in the Peruvian government, is the influence of reli∣gion upon its genius and laws. Religious ideas make such a feeble impression on the mind of a savage, that their effect upon his sentiments and manners is hardly perceptible. Among the Mexi∣cans, religion, reduced into a regular system, and holding a considerable place in their public insti∣tutions, operated with conspicuous efficacy in form∣ing the peculiar character of that people. But in Peru, the whole system of civil policy was founded on religion. The Inca appeared not only as a le∣gislator, but as the messenger of Heaven. His pre∣cepts were received not merely as the injunctions of a superior, but as the mandates of the Deity. His race was to be held sacred; and in order to preserve it distinct, without being polluted by any mixture of less noble blood, the sons of Manco Capac married their own sisters, and no person was ever admitted to the throne who could not claim it by such a pure descent. To those <HI>Children of the Sun,</HI> for that was the appellation bestowed upon all the offspring of the first Inca, the people looked up with the reverence due to beings of a superior order. They were deemed to be under the im∣mediate protection of the deity from whom they issued, and by his every order of the reigning Inca was supposed to be dictated.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Two re∣markable effects of this.</NOTE>FROM those ideas two consequences resulted. The authority of the Inca was unlimited and abso∣lute, in the most extensive meaning of the words. Whenever the decrees of a prince are considered as the commands of the Divinity, it is not only an act
<PB N="313" REF="034476_0820_0FFDDC9407C59408"/>
of rebellion, but of impiety, to dispute or oppose his will. Obedience becomes a duty of religion; and as it would be prophane to control a monarch who is believed to be under the guidance of Heaven,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> abso∣lute power of the Inca.</NOTE> and presumptuous to advise him, nothing remains but to submit with implicit respect. This must ne∣cessarily be the effect of every government esta∣blished on pretensions of intercourse with superior powers. Such accordingly was the blind submission which the Peruvians yielded to their sovereigns. The persons of highest rank and greatest power in their dominions acknowledged them to be of a more exalted nature; and in testimony of this, when admitted into their presence, they entered with a burden upon their shoulders, as an emblem of their servitude, and willingness to bear whatever the Inca was pleased to impose. Among their subjects, force was not requisite to second their commands. Every officer entrusted with the exe∣cution of them was revered, and, according to the account of an intelligent observer of Peruvian manners<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. i. c. 13.</NOTE>, he might proceed alone from one extre∣mity of the empire to another without meeting op∣position; for, on producing a fringe from the royal <HI>Borla,</HI> an ornament of the head peculiar to the reigning Inca, the lives and fortunes of the people were at his disposal.</P>
<P>ANOTHER consequence of establishing govern∣ment in Peru on the foundation of religion was,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All crimes punished capitally.</NOTE> that all crimes were punished capitally. They were not considered as transgressions of human laws, but as insults offered to the Deity. Each, without any distinction between such as were slight and such as were atrocious, called for vengeance, and could be expiated only by the blood of the offender.
<PB N="314" REF="034476_0821_0FFDDC97B13B9B70"/>
Consonantly to the same ideas, punishment followed the trespass with inevitable certainty, because an offence against Heaven was deemed such an high enormity as could not be pardoned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vega, lib. ii. c. 6.</NOTE>. Among a people of corrupted morals, maxims of jurisprudence so severe and unrelenting, by rendering men fero∣cious and desperate, would be more apt to multiply crimes than to restrain them. But the Peruvians, of simple manners and unsuspicious faith, were held in such awe by this rigid discipline, that the number of offenders was extremely small. Vene∣ration for monarchs, enlightened and directed, as they believed, by the divinity whom they adored, prompted them to their duty; the dread of pu∣nishment, which they were taught to consider as unavoidable vengeance inflicted by offended Hea∣ven, withheld them from evil.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Mild geni∣us of their religion.</NOTE>THE system of superstition on which the Incas ingrafted their pretensions to such high authority, was of a genius very different from that established among the Mexicans. Manco Capac turned the veneration of his followers entirely towards natural objects. The Sun, as the great source of light, of joy, and fertility in the creation, attracted their principal homage. The Moon and Stars, as co∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rating with him, were entitled to secondary ho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>. Wherever the propensity in the human mind <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> acknowledge and to adore some superior power, takes this direction, and is employed in contemplating the order and beneficence that really exist in nature, the spirit of superstition is mild. Wherever imaginary beings, created by the fancy and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ars of men, are supposed to preside in nature, and become the objects of worship, su∣perstition always assumes a more severe and atro∣cious
<PB N="315" REF="034476_0822_0FFDDC9A5000D510"/>
form. Of the latter we have an example among the Mexicans, of the former among the people of Peru. The Peruvians had not, indeed, made such progress in observation or inquiry, as to have attained just conceptions of the deity; nor was there in their language any proper name or appellation of the Supreme Power, which inti∣mated, that they had formed any idea of him as the Creator and Governor of the World<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acosta, lib. v. c. 3.</NOTE>. But by directing their veneration to that glorious luminary, which, by its universal and vivifying energy, is the best emblem of divine beneficence, the ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es and observances which they deemed acceptable to him were innocent and humane. They offered to the Sun a part of those productions which his ge∣nial warmth had called sorth from the bosom of the earth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to maturity. They sacrificed, as an oblation of gratitude, some of the animals which were indebted to his influence for nourishment. They presented to him choice specimens of those works of ingenuity which his light had guided the hand of man in forming. But the Incas never stained his altars with human blood, nor could they conceive that their beneficent father the Sun would be delighted with such horrid victims<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXI.</NOTE>. Thus the Peruvians, unacquainted with those bar∣barous rites which extinguish sensibility, and sup∣press the feelings of nature at the sight of human sufferings, were formed by the spirit of the super∣stition which they had adopted, to a national cha∣racter, more gentle than that of any people in America.</P>
<P>THE influence of this superstition operated in the same manner upon their civil institutions,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> influ∣ence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣vil policy.</NOTE> and tend∣ed to correct in them whatever was adverse to gen∣tleness
<PB N="316" REF="034476_0823_0FFDDC9BE6E6B998"/>
of character. The dominion of the Incas, though the most absolute of all despotisms, was miti∣gated by its alliance with religion. The mind was not humbled and depressed by the idea of a forced subjection to the will of a superior; obedience, paid to one who was believed to be clothed with divine authority, was willingly yielded, and im∣plied no degradation. The sovereign, conscious that the submissive reverence of his people flowed from their belief of his heavenly descent, was con∣tinually reminded of a distinction which prompted him to imitate that beneficent power which he was supposed to represent. In consequence of those impressions, there hardly occurs in the traditional history of Peru, any instance of rebellion against the reigning prince, and among twelve successive monarchs, there was not one tyrant.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">and on their military syste<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></NOTE>EVEN the wars in which the Incas engaged, were carried on with a spirit very different from that of other American nations. They fought not, like savages, to destroy and exterminate; or, like the Mexicans, to glut blood-thirsty divinities with human sacrifices. They conquered, in order to reclaim and civilize the vanquished, and to diffuse the knowledge of their own institutions and arts. Prisoners seem not to have been exposed to the in∣sults and tortures, which were their lot in every other part of the New World. The Incas took the people whom they subdued under their pro∣tection, and admitted them to a participation of all the advantages enjoyed by their original sub∣jects. This practice, so repugnant to American ferocity and resembling the humanity of the most polished <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tions, must be ascribed, like other pe∣culiarities <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ch we have observed in the Peruvian manners, to the genius of their religion. The Incas, considering the homage paid to any other
<PB N="317" REF="034476_0824_0FFDDC9FD590D7F0"/>
object than to the heavenly powers which they adored is impious, were fond of gaining proselytes to their favourite system. The idols of every con∣quered province were carried in trumph to the great temple at Cuzco<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. iv. c. 4. Vega, lib. v. c. 12.</NOTE>, and placed there as tro∣phies of the superior power of the divinity who was the protector of the empire. The people were treated with lenity, and instructed in the religious tenets of their new masters<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. iv. c. 8.</NOTE>, that the conqueror might have the glory of having added to the num∣ber of the votaries of his father the Sun.</P>
<P>THE state of property in Peru was no less sin∣gular than that of religion, and contributed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peculiar state of property.</NOTE> like∣wise, towards giving a mild turn of character to the people. All the lands capable of cultivation were divided into three shares. One was conse∣crated to the Sun, and the product of it was ap∣plied to the erection of temples, and furnishing what was requisite towards celebrating the public rites of religion. The second belonged to the Inca, and was set apart as the provision made by the community for the support of government. The third and largest share was reserved for the maintenance of the people, among whom it was parcelled out. Neither individuals, however, nor communities, had a right of exclusive property in the portion set apart for their use. They possessed it only for a year, at the expiration of which a new division was made in proportion to the rank, the number, and exigencies of each family. All those lands were cultivated by the joint industry of the community. The people, summoned by a proper officer, repaired in a body to the fields, and per∣formed their common task, while songs and musical
<PB N="318" REF="034476_0825_0FFDDCA164CB7EA0"/>
instruments cheered them to their labour<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. iv. c. 2. Vega, lib. v. c. 5.</NOTE>. By this singular distribution of territory, as well as by the mode of cultivating it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Effects of this.</NOTE> the idea of a common in∣terest, and of mutual subserviency, was continually inculcated. Each individual felt his connection with those around him, and knew that he depended on their friendly aid for what increase he was to reap. A state thus constituted may be considered as one great family, in which the union of the members was so complete, and the exchange of good offices so perceptible, as to create stronger attachment, and to bind man to man in closer intercourse, than subsisted under any form of society established in America. From this resulted gentle manners, and mild virtues unknown in the savage state, and with which the Mexicans were little acquainted.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Inequality of ranks.</NOTE>BUT, though the institutions of the Incas were so framed as to strengthen the bonds of affection among their subjects, there was great inequality in their condition. The distinction of ranks was fully established in Peru. A great body of the inhabit∣ants, under the denomination of <HI>Yanaconas,</HI> were held in a state of servitude. Their garb and houses were of a form different from those of free∣men. Like the <HI>Tamemes</HI> of Mexico, they were employed in carrying burdens, and in performing every other work of drudgery<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. iii. c. 4. lib. x. c. 8.</NOTE>. Next to them in rank, were such of the people as were free, but distinguished by no official or hereditary honours. Above them were raised, those whom the Spaniards call <HI>Orejones,</HI> from the ornaments worn in their ears. They formed what may be denominated the order of nobles, and in peace as well as war held every office of power or trust<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. 5. lib. iv. c. 1.</NOTE>. At the head

But the Spaniards having been acquainted with the improved state of various arts in Mexico, several years before they discovered Peru, were not so much struck with what they observed in the latter country, and describe the appearances of ingenuity there with less warmth of admiration. The Peru∣vians, nevertheless, had advanced far beyond the Mexicans, both in the necessary arts of life, and in such as have some title to the name of elegant.</P>
<P>IN Peru, agriculture,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Improved <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a∣griculture.</NOTE> the art of primary neces∣sity in social life, was more extensive, and carried on with greater skill than in any par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of America. The Spaniards, in their progress through the coun∣try, were so fully supplied with provisions of every kind, that in the relation of their adventures we meet with few of those dismal scenes of distress oc∣casioned by famine, in which the conquerors of Mexico were so often involved. The quantity of soil under cultivation was not left to the discretion of individuals, but regulated by public authority in proportion to the exigencies of the community. Even the calamity of an unfruitful season was but little felt, for the product of the lands consecrated to the Sun, as well as those set apart for the Incas, being deposited in the <HI>Tambes,</HI> or public storehouses, it remained there as a stated provision for times of scarcity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. i. c. 14.

to the demands of the state, the invention and in∣dustry of the Peruvians were called forth to ex∣traordinary exertions, by certain defects peculiar to their climate and soil. All the vast rivers that flow from the Andes take their course eastward to the Atlantic Ocean. Peru is watered only by some streams which rush down from the mountains like torrents. A great part of the low country is sandy and barren, and never refreshed with rain. In order to render such an unpromising region fertile, the ingenuity of the Peruvians had recourse to va∣rious expedients.

<P>THE superior ingenuity of the Peruvians is ob∣vious, likewise,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their buildings.</NOTE> in the construction of their houses and public buildings. In the extensive plains which stretch along the Pacific Ocean, where the sky is perpetually serene, and the climate mild, their houses were very properly of a fabric ex∣tremely slight. But in the higher regions, where rain falls, where the vicissitude of seasons is known, and their rigour felt, houses were constructed with greater solidity. They were generally of a square form, the walls about eight feet high, built with bricks hardened in the sun, without any windows, and the door low and strait. Simple as these struc∣tures were, and rude as the materials may seem to be of which they were formed, they were so durable, that many of them still subsist in different parts of Peru, long after every monument that might have conveyed to us any idea of the domestic state of the other American nations has vanished from the face of the earth. But it was in the tem∣ples consecrated to the Sun, and in the buildings destined for the residence of their monarchs, that the Peruvians displayed the utmost extent of their art and contrivance. The descriptions of them by such of the Spanish writers as had an opportunity of contemplating them, while, in some measure, entire, might have appeared highly exaggerated, if the ruins which still remain, did not vouch the truth of their relations. These ruins of sacred or royal buildings are found in every province of the empire, and by their frequency demonstrate that they are monuments of a powerful people, who must have subsisted, during a period of some extent, in
<PB N="322" REF="034476_0829_0FFDDCAF505CB0B0"/>
a state of no inconsiderable improvement. They appear to have been edifices various in their di∣mensions. Some of a moderate size, many of im∣mense extent, all remarkable for solidity, and re∣sembling each other in the stile of architecture. The temple of Pachacamac, together with a pa∣lace of the Inca, and a fortress, were so connected together as to form one great structure, above half a league in circuit. In this prodigious pile, the same singular taste in building is conspicuous, as in other works of the Peruvians. As they were unacquainted with the use of the pulley, and other mechanical powers, and could not elevate the large stones and bricks which they employed in building to any considerable height, the walls of this edi∣fice, in which they seem to have made their greatest effort towards magnificence, did not rise above twelve feet from the ground. Though they had not discovered the use of mortar or of any other cement in building, the bricks or stones were join∣ed with so much nicety, that the seams can hardly be discerned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXIII.</NOTE>. The apartments, as far as the dis∣tribution of them can be traced in the ruins, were ill-disposed, and afforded little accommodation. There was not a single window in any part of the building; and as no light could enter but by the door, all the apartments of largest dimension must either have been perfectly dark, or illuminated by some other means. But with all these, and many other imperfections that might be mentioned in their art of building, the works of the Peruvians which still remain, must be considered as stupen∣dous efforts of a people unacquainted with the use of iron, and convey to us an high idea of the power possessed by their ancient monarchs.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="034476_0830_0FFDDCB0DFC20910"/>THESE, however, were not the noblest or most useful works of the Incas. The two great roads from Cuzco to Quito,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> pub∣lic roads,</NOTE> extending in an uninter∣rupted stretch above fifteen hundred miles, are en∣titled to still higher praise.

From the language of admiration in which some of the early writers express their astonishment when they first viewed those roads, and from the more pomp∣ous descriptions of later writers, who labour to sup∣port some favourite theory concerning America, one might be led to compare this work of the Incas to the famous military ways which remain as monuments of the Roman power: But in a country where there was no tame animal except the Llama, which was never use<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for draught, and but little as a beast of burden, where the high roads were sel∣dom trod by any but a human foot, no great de∣gree of labour or art was requisite in forming them. The Peruvian roads were only fifteen feet in breadth<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cieca, c. 60.</NOTE>, and in many places so slightly formed, that time has effaced every vestige of the course in which they ran. In the low country little more seems to have been done, than to plant trees or to fix posts at certain intervals, in order to mark the proper rout to travellers. To open a path through the mountainous country was a more arduous task. Eminences were levelled, and hollows filled up, and for the preservation of the road it was fenced with a bank of turf. At proper distances, Tambos, or storehouses, were erected for the accommoda∣tion of the Inca and his attendants, in their progress, through his dominions. From the manner in which the road was originally formed in this higher and

Such was the celebrated road of the Incas; and even from this description, divested of every circum∣stance of manifest exaggeration, or of suspicious aspect, it must be considered as a striking proof of an extraordinary progress in improvement and po∣licy. To the savage tribes of America, the idea of facilitating communication with places at a dis∣tance had never occurred. To the Mexicans it was hardly known. Even in the most civilized countries of Europe, men had advanced far in re∣finement, before it became a regular object of na∣tional police to form such roads as render inter∣course commodious. It was a capital object of Roman policy to open a communication with all the provinces of their extensive empire, by means of those roads which are justly considered as one of the noblest monuments both of their wisdom and their power. But during the long reign of barba∣rism, the Roman roads were neglected or destroyed; and at the time when the Spaniards entered Peru, no kingdom in Europe could boast of any work of public utility that could be compared with the great roads formed by the Incas.</P>

Ocean. From the rapidity of their course, as well as from the frequency and violence of their inundation, these were not fordable. Some expe∣dient, however, was to be found for passing them. The Peruvians, from their unacquaintance with the use of arches, and their inability to work in wood, could not construct bridges either of stone or tim∣ber. But necessity, the parent of invention, sug∣gested a device which supplied that defect. They formed cables of great strength, by twisting toge∣ther some of the pliable withs or o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iers, with which their country abounds; six of these cables they stretched across the stream parallel to one another, and made them fast on each side.

had made some progress in arts, which may be called elegant. They possessed the precious metals in greater abundance than any people of America. They obtained gold in the same manner with the Mexicans, by searching in the channels of rivers, or washing the earth in which particles of it were con∣tained. But in order to procure silver, they ex∣erted no inconsiderable degree of skill and inven∣tion. They had not, indeed, attained the art of sinking a shaft into the bowels of the earth, and penetrating to the riches concealed there; but they hollowed deep caverns on the banks of rivers and the sides of mountains, and emptied such veins as did not dip suddenly beyond their reach. In other places, where the vein lay near the surface, they dug pits to such a depth, that the person who worked below could throw out the ore, or hand it up in baskets<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ramusio, iii. 414, A.</NOTE>. They had discovered the art of smelting and refining this, either by the simple ap∣plication of fire, or where the ore was more stub∣born, and impregnated with foreign substances, by placing it in small ovens or furnaces, on high grounds, so artificially constructed, that the draught of air performed the function of a bellows, an en∣gine with which they were totally unacquainted. By this simple device, the purer ores were smelted with facility, and the quantity of silver in Peru was so considerable, that many of the utensils employed in the functions of common life were made of it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Acosta, lib. iv. c. 4, 5. Vega, p. 1. lib. viii. c. 25. Ul∣loa Entreten. 256.</NOTE>. Several of those vessels and trinkets are said to have merited no small degree of estimation, on account of the neatness of the workmanship, as well as the intrinsic value of the materials. But as the con∣querors
<PB N="327" REF="034476_0834_0FFDDCBB87598FB0"/>
of America were well acquainted with the latter, but had scarcely any conception of the former, most of the silver vessels and trinkets were melted down, and rated according to the weight and fineness of the metal in the division of the spoil.</P>
<P>IN other works of mere curiosity or ornament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Works of elegance.</NOTE> their ingenuity has been highly celebrated. Many specimens of those have been dug out of the <HI>Gua∣cas,</HI> or mounds of earth, with which the Peruvians covered the bodies of the dead. Among these are mirrors of various dimensions, of hard shining stones highly polished; vessels of earthen ware of different forms; hatchets, and other instruments, some des∣tined for war, and others for labour. Some were of flint, some of copper, hardened to such a degree by an unknown process, as to supply the place of iron on several occasions. Had the use of those tools formed of copper been general, the progress of the Peruvians in the arts might have been such, as to emulate that of more cultivated nations. But either the metal was so rare, or the operation by which it was hardened so tedious, that their instru∣ments of copper were few, and so extremely small, that they seem to have been employed only in slighter works. But even to such a circumscribed use of this imperfect metal, the Peruvians were in∣debted for their superiority to the other people of America in various arts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ulloa Voy. tom. i. 381, &amp;c. Id. Entreten. p. 369. &amp;c.</NOTE>. The same observation, however, may be applied to them, which I for∣merly made with respect to the arts of the Mexi∣cans. From several specimens of Peruvian utensils and ornaments, which are deposited in the royal ca∣binet of Madrid, and from some preserved in dif∣ferent
<PB N="328" REF="034476_0835_0FFDDCBE22FB71C0"/>
collections in other parts of Europe, I have reason to believe that the workmanship is more to be admired on account of the rude tools with which it was executed, than on account of its intrinsic nearness and elegance; and that the Peruvians, though the most improved of all the Americans, were not advanced beyond the infancy of arts.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">An imper∣fect civili∣zation.</NOTE>BUT notwithstanding so many particulars, which seem to indicate an high degree of improvement in Peru, other circumstances occur that suggest the idea of a society still in the first stages of its transi∣tion from barbarism to civilization. In all the do∣minions of the Incas,<NOTE PLACE="marg">No cities but Cuzco.</NOTE> Cuzco was the only place that had the appearance, or was entitled to the name of a city. Every where else, the people lived mostly in detached habitations, dispersed over the country, or, at the utmost, settled together in small vil∣lages<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zarate, lib. i. c. 9. Herrera, dec. 5. lib. vi. c. 4.</NOTE>. But until men are brought to assemble in numerous bodies, and incorporated in such close union, as to enjoy frequent intercourse, and to feel mutual dependence, they never imbibe perfectly the spirit, or assume the manners of social life. In a country of immense extent, with only one city, the progress of manners, and the improvement either of the necessary or more refined arts, must have been so slow, and carried on under such disad∣vantages, that it is more surprising the Peruvians should have advanced so far in refinement, than that they did not proceed farther.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">No perfect separation of profes∣sions.</NOTE>IN consequence of this state of imperfect union, the separation of professions in Peru was not so complete as among the Mexicans.

become so complex or difficult, as to render it re∣quisite that men should be trained to them by any particular course of education. All the arts ac∣cordingly, which were of daily and dispensable uti∣lity, were exercised by every Peruvian indiscrimin∣ately. None but the artists employed in works of mere curiosity or ornament, constituted a separate order of men, or were distinguished from other citizens<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acosta, lib. vi. c. 15.

<P>FROM the want of cities in Peru,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Little com∣mercial in∣tercourse.</NOTE> another conse∣quence followed. There was little commercial in∣tercourse among the inhabitants of that great em∣pire. The activity of commerce is coeval with the foundation of cities; and from the moment that the members of any community settle in consider∣able numbers in one place, its operations become vigorous. The citizen must depend for subsistence on the labour of those who cultivate the ground. They, in return, must receive some equivalent. Thus mutual intercourse is established, and the productions of art are regularly exchanged for the fruits of agriculture. In the towns of the Mexi∣can empire, stated markets were held, and what∣ever could supply any want or desire of man was an object of commerce. But in Peru, from the singular mode of dividing property, and the man∣ner in which the people were settled, there was hardly any species of commerce carried on between different provinces<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vega, lib. vi. c. 8.</NOTE>, and the community was less acquainted with that active intercourse, which is at once a bond of union, and an incentive to im∣provement.</P>
<P>BUT the unwarlike spirit of the Peruvians was the most remarkable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Unwarlike spirit of the Peruvians.</NOTE> as well as most fatal defect in

their character<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Xeres, 190. Sancho ap. Ramus. iii. 372. Herrera, dec. 5. lib. i. c. 3.</NOTE>. The greater part of the rude nations of America opposed their invaders with undaunted ferocity, though with little conduct or success. The Mexicans maintained the struggle in defence of their liberties, with such persevering fortitude, that it was with difficulty the Spaniards triumphed over them. Peru was subbued at once, and almost without resistance; and the most fa∣vourable opportunities of regaining their freedom, and of crushing their oppressors, were lost through the timidity of the people. Though the traditional history of the Peruvians represents all the Incas as warlike princes, frequently at the head of armies, which they led to victory and conquest; few symp∣toms of such a martial spirit appear in any of their operations subsequent to the invasion of the Spa∣niards. The influence, perhaps, of those institu∣tions which rendered their manners gentle, gave their minds this unmanly softness; perhaps, the constant serenity and mildness of the climate may have enervated the vigour of their frame; perhaps, some principle in their government, unknown to us, was the occasion of this political debility. What∣ever may have been the cause, the fact is certain, and there is not an instance in history of any people <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o little advanced in refinement, so totally des∣titute of military enterprize. This character hath descended to their posterity. The Indians of Peru are now more tame and depressed than any people of America.

<P>BUT, besides those capital defects in the political state of Peru, some detached circumstances and
<PB N="331" REF="034476_0838_0FFDDCC610C941A8"/>
facts occur in the Spanish writers, which discover a considerable remainder of barbarity in their man∣ners. A cruel custom, that prevailed in some of the most savage tribes, subsisted among the Peru∣vians. On the death of the Incas, and of other eminent persons, a considerable number of their at∣tendants was put to death, and interred around their Guacas, that they might appear in the next world with their former dignity, and be served with the same respect. On the death of Huana-Capac, the most powerful of their monarchs, above a thousand victims were doomed to accompany him to the tomb<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acosta, lib. v. c. 7.</NOTE>. In one particular, their manners appear to have been more barbarous than those of most rude tribes. Though acquainted with the use of fire in preparing maize, and other vegetables for food; they devoured both flesh and fish perfectly raw, and astonished the Spaniards, with a practice repugnant to the ideas of all civilized people<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Xerez. p. 190.

They extend through the most delightful part of the tem∣perate zone; their soil is, in general, remarkably fertile, and all their productions, whether animal or vegetable, are most perfect in their kind. They have all a communication either with the Pacific Ocean or with the Gulph of Mexico, and are wa∣tered by rivers which not only enrich them, but may become subservient to commerce. The num∣ber of Spaniards settled in those vast countries, is indeed extremely small. They may be said to have subdued rather than to have occupied them. But

Wherever these are opened, and worked with success, a mul∣titude of people resort. In order to supply them with the necessaries of life, cultivation must be in∣creased, artisans of various kinds must assemble, and industry as well as wealth will be gradually diffused. Many examples of this have occurred in different parts of America since they fell under the dominion of the Spaniards. Populous villages and large towns have suddenly arisen amidst uninhabited wilds and mountains; and the working of mines, though far from being the most proper object to∣wards which the attention of an infant society should be turned, may become the means both of pro∣moting useful activity, and of augmenting the number of people.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A recent and remar∣kable dis∣covery.</NOTE> A recent and singular instance of this has happened, which, as it is but little known in Europe, and may be productive of great effects, merits attention. The Spaniards settled in the provinces of Cinaloe and Sonora, had been long disturbed by the depredations of some fierce tribes of Indians. In the year 1765, the incursions of those savages became so frequent, and so destruc∣tive, that the Spanish inhabitants, in despair, ap∣plied to the Marquis de Croix, viceroy of Mexico, for such a body of troops as might enable them to drive those formidable invaders from their places of retreat in the mountains. But the treasury of Mexico was so much exhausted by the large sums
<PB N="334" REF="034476_0841_0FFDDCCF17728870"/>
drawn from it, in order to support the late war against Great Britain, that the viceroy could afford them no aid. The respect due to his virtues, ac∣complished what his official power could not effect. He prevailed with the merchants of New Spain to advance about two hundred thousand pesos for defraying the expence of the expedition. The war was conducted by an officer of abilities; and after being protracted for three years, chiefly by the dif∣ficulty of pursuing the fugitives over mountains and through defiles which were almost impassable, it terminated, in the year 1771, in the final submis∣sion of the tribes, which had been so long the ob∣ject of terror to the two provinces. In the course of this service, the Spaniards marched through countries into which they seem not to have pene∣trated before that time, and discovered mines of such value, as was astonishing even to men ac∣quainted with the riches contained in the mountains of the New World. At Cineguilla, in the province of Sonora, they entered a plain of fourteen leagues in extent, in which, at the depth of only sixteen inches, they found gold in grains of such a size, that some of them weighed nine marks, and in such quantities, that in a short time with a few labour∣ers, they collected a thousand marks of gold in grains, even without taking time to wash the earth that had been dug, which appeared to be so rich, that persons of skill computed that it might yield what would be equal in value to a million of pesos. Before the end of the year 1771,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Probable effects of this.</NOTE> above two thou∣sand persons were settled in Cineguilla, under the government of proper magistrates, and the inspec∣tion of several ecclesiastics. As several other mines, not inferior in richness to that of Cineguilla, have been discovered, both in Sonora and Cinaloa<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXV.</NOTE>, it is
<PB N="335" REF="034476_0842_0FFDDCD0A716CA48"/>
probable that these neglected and thinly inhabited provinces, may soon become as populous and va∣luable as any part of the Spanish empire in America.</P>
<P>THE peninsula of California,<NOTE PLACE="marg">California, its state,</NOTE> on the other side of the Vermilion sea, seems to have been less known to the ancient Mexicans, than the provinces which I have mentioned. It was discovered by Cortes in the year 1536<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book v. vol. ii. p. 412.</NOTE>. During a long period it continued to be so little frequented, that even its form was unknown, and in most charts it was represented as an island, not as a peninsula<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXVI.</NOTE>. Though the cli∣mate of this country, if we may judge from its situation, must be very desirable; the Spaniards have made small progress in peopling it. Towards the close of the last century, the Jesuits, who had great merit in exploring this neglected province, and in civilizing its rude inhabitants, imperceptibly acquired a dominion over it as complete as that which they possessed in their missions in Paraguay, and they laboured to introduce into it the same po∣licy, and to govern the natives by the same maxims. In order to prevent the court of Spain from con∣ceiving any jealousy of their designs and operations, they seem studiously to have depreciated the coun∣try, by representing the climate as so disagreeable and unwholesome, and the soil as so barren, that nothing but a zealous desire of converting the natives, could have induced them to settle there<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Venegas, Hist. of Califor. i. 26.</NOTE>.

From its vicinity to Cinaloa and So∣nora, it is probable, that if the population of these provinces shall increase in the manner which I have supposed, California may, by degrees, receive from them such a recruit of inhabitants, as to be no longer reckoned among the desolate and useless districts of the Spanish empire.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Yucatan and Hon∣duras.</NOTE>ON the east of Mexico, Yucatan and Honduras are comprehended in the government of New Spain, though anciently they can hardly be said to have formed a part of the Mexican empire.

of the Spanish territories. One of the first objects which tempted the English settled in that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>and, was the great profit arising from the log∣wood trade, and the facility of wresting some por∣tion of it from the Spaniards.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their de∣cline,</NOTE> Some adventurers from Jamaica made the first attempt at Cape Ca∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>che, the south-east promontory of Yucatan, and by cutting logwood there, carried on a gainful traffic. When most of the trees near the coast in that place were felled, they removed to the island of Trist, in the Bay of Campeachy; and in later times, their principal station has been in the Bay of Honduras. The Spaniards, alarmed at this en∣croachment, endeavoured by negociation, remon∣strances, and open force, to prevent the English from obtaining any footing on that part of the A∣merican continent. But after struggling against it for more than a century, the disasters of last war extorted from the Court of Madrid a reluctant consent to tolerate this settlement of foreigners in the heart of its territories<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Treaty of Paris, Art. xviii.</NOTE>. The pain which this humbling concession occasioned, seems to have prompted the Spaniards to devise a method of ren∣dering it of little consequence, more effectual than all the efforts of negociation or violence. The logwood produced on the west coast of Yucatan, where the soil is drier, is in quality far superior to that which grows on the marshy grounds where the English are settled.<NOTE PLACE="marg">and revival.</NOTE> By encouraging the cutting of this, and permitting the importation of it into Spain without paying any duty<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Real Cedula, Campomanes, iii. 145.</NOTE>, such vigour has been given to this branch of commerce, and the logwood which the English bring to market has sunk so much in value, that their trade to the Bay

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Costa Rica and Vera∣gua.</NOTE>STILL farther east than Honduras lie the two provinces of Costa Rica and Veragua, which like∣wise belong to the vice-royalty of New Spain; but both have been so much neglected by the Spaniards, and are apparently of such small value, that they merit no particular attention.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Chili.</NOTE>THE most important province depending on the vice-royalty of Peru, is Chili. The Incas had established their dominion in some of its northern districts; but in the greater part of the country, its gallant and high-spirited inhabitants maintained their independence. The Spaniards, allured by the same of its opulence, early attempted the con∣quest of it under Diego Almagro; and after his death, Pedro de Valdivia resumed the design. Both met with fierce opposition. The former relin∣quished the enterprize in the manner which I have mentioned<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Book vi. c. 60, &amp;c.</NOTE>. The latter, after having given many displays, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th of courage and military skill, was cut off, together with a considerable body of troops under his command. Francisco de Villagra, Val∣divia's lieutenant, by his spirited conduct, checked the natives in their career, and saved the remain∣der of the Spaniards from destruction. By de∣grees, all the champaign country along the coast was subjected to the Spanish dominion. The mountainous country is still possessed by the Puel∣ches, Araucos, and other tribes of its original in∣habitants, formidable neighbours to the Spaniards;
<PB N="339" REF="034476_0846_0FFDDCDB46A90078"/>
with whom, during the course of two centuries, they have been obliged to maintain almost perpe∣tual hostility, suspended only by a few intervals of insecure peace.</P>
<P>THAT part of Chili then,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Excellence of its cli∣mate and soil.</NOTE> which may properly be deemed a Spanish province, is a narrow district, extended along the coast from the desert of Ata∣camas to the island of Chiloe, above nine hundred miles. Its climate is the most delicious in the New World, and is hardly equalled by that of any re∣gion on the face of the earth. Though bordering on the Torrid Zone, it never feels the extremity of heat, being screened on the east by the Andes, and refreshed from the west by cooling sea-breezes. The temperature of the air is so mild and equable, that the Spaniards give it the preference to that of the southern provinces in their native country. The fertility ot the soil corresponds with the benignity of the climate, and is wonderfully accommodated to European productions. The most valuable of these, corn, wine, and oil, abound in Chili, as if they had been native to the country. All the fruits imported from Europe attain to full maturity there. The animals of our hemisphere not only multiply, but improve in this delightful region. The horned cattle are of larger size than those of Spain. Its breed of horses surpasses, both in beauty and in spirit, the famous Andalusian race, from which they sprung. Nor has nature exhausted her bounty on the surface of the earth; she has stored its bowels with riches. Valuable mines of gold, of silver, of copper, and of lead, have been discovered in va∣rious parts of it.</P>
<P>A COUNTRY distinguished by so many blessings,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cause of its being neglected by the Spa∣niards.</NOTE> we may be apt to conclude, would early become a favourite station of the Spaniards, and must have been cultivated with peculiar predilection and care.
<PB N="340" REF="034476_0847_0FFDDCDDE85706C0"/>
Instead of this, a great part of it remains unoccu∣pied. In all this extent of country, there are not above eighty thousand white inhabitants, and about three times that number of negroes and people of a mixed race. The most fertile soil in America lies uncultivated, and some of its most promising mines remain unwrought. Strange as this neglect of the Spaniards to avail themselves of advantages, which seemed to court their acceptance, may ap∣pear, the causes of it can be traced. The only intercourse of Spain with its colonies in the South Sea, was carried on during two centuries by the annual fleet to Porto-bello. All the produce of these colonies was shipped in the ports of Callao, or Arica in Peru, for Panama, and carried from thence across the isthmus. All the commodities which they received from the mother-country, were conveyed from Panama, to the same harbours. Thus both the exports and imports of Chili passed through the hands of merchants settled in Peru. These had of course a profit on each; and in bou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> transactions the Chilese felt their own subordina∣tion; and having no direct intercourse with the parent state, they depended upon another province for the disposal of their productions, as well as for the supply of their wants. Under such discourage∣ments, population could not increase,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prospect of its im∣provement.</NOTE> and industry was destitute of one chief incitement. But now that Spain, from motives which I shall mention hereafter, has adopted a new system, and carries on her commerce with the colonies in the South Sea, by ships which go round Cape Horn, a direct in∣tercourse is opened between Chili and the mother-country. The gold, the silver, and the other com∣modities of the province will be exchanged in its own harbours for the manufactures of Europe, Chili may speedily rise into that importance among
<PB N="341" REF="034476_0848_0FFDDCDFA89534B8"/>
the Spanish settlements to which it is entitled by its natural advantages. It may become the granary of Peru, and the other provinces along the Pacific Occean. It may supply them with wine, with cattle, with horses, with hemp, and many other articles for which they now depend upon Europe. Though the new system has been established only a few years, those effects of it begin already to be observed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Campomanes, ii. 157.</NOTE>. If it shall be adhered to with any steadiness for half a century, one may venture to foretel, that popula∣tion, industry, and opulence will advance in this province with rapid progress.</P>
<P>TO the east of the Andes,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Provinces of Tucu∣man and Rio de la Plata.</NOTE> the provinces of Tu∣cuman and Rio de la Plata border on Chili, and like it were dependent on the vice-royalty of Peru. These regions of immense extent stretch in length from north to south above thirteen hundred miles, and in brea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th more than a thousand.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Northern and south∣ern division.</NOTE> This coun∣try, which is larger than most European kingdoms, naturally forms itself into two great divisions, one on the north, and the other on the south of Rio de la Plata. The former comprehends Paraguay, the famous missions of the Jesuits, and several other districts. But as disputes have long subsisted be∣tween the courts of Spain and Portugal, concern∣ing its boundaries, which, it is probable, will be soon finally ascertained, either amicably, or by the decision of the sword, I chuse to reserve my account of this northern division, until I enter upon the his∣tory of Portuguese America, with which it is in∣timately connected; and, in relating it, I shall be able, from authentic materials, supplied both by Spain and Portugal, to give a full and accurate de∣scription of the operations and views of the jesuits, in rearing that singular fabric of policy in America,
<PB N="342" REF="034476_0849_0FFDDCE8A57B7198"/>
which has drawn so much attention, and has been so imperfectly understood. The latter division of the province contains the governments of Tucuman and Buenos-Ayres, and to these I shall at present con∣fine my observations.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">View of the latter.</NOTE>THE Spaniards entered this part of America by the river De la Plata; and though a succession of cruel disasters besel them in their early attempts to establish their dominion in it, they were encouraged to persist in the design, at first by the hopes of disco∣vering mines in the interior country, and afterwards by the necessity of occupying it, in order to prevent any other nation from settling there, and penetrating by this rout into their rich possessions in Peru. But except at Buenos-Ayres, they have made no settle∣ment of any consequence in all the vast space which I have mentioned. There are, indeed, scattered over it, a few places on which they have bestowed the name of towns, and to which they have endea∣voured to add some dignity, by erecting them into bishoprics; but they are no better than paltry vil∣lages, each with two or three hundred inhabitants. One circumstance, however, which was not ori∣ginally foreseen, has contributed to render this dis∣trict, though thinly peopled, of considerable import∣ance. The province of Tucuman, together with the country to the south of the Plata, instead of being covered with wood like other parts of Ame∣rica, forms one extensive open plain, almost without a tree. The soil is a deep fertile mould, watered by many streams descending from the Andes, and clothed in perpetual verdure. In this rich pasturage, the horses and cattle imported by the Spaniards from Europe have multiplied to a degree which al∣most exceeds belief. This has enabled the inhabit∣ants not only to open a lucrative trade with Peru, by supplying it with cattle, horses, and mules, but
<PB N="343" REF="034476_0850_0FFDDCEDF7FB2188"/>
to carry on a commerce no less beneficial, by the exportation of hides to Europe. From both, the colony has derived great advantages. But its com∣modious situation for carrying on contraband trade, has been the chief source of its prosperity. While the court of Madrid adhered to its ancient system, with respect to its communication with America, the river De la Plata lay so much out of their course of Spanish navigation, that interlopers, almost without any risk of being either observed or obstructed, could pour in European manufactures in such quan∣tities, that they not only supplied the wants of the colony, but were conveyed into all the eastern districts of Peru. When the Portuguese in Brasil extended their settlements to the banks of Rio de la Plata, a new channel was opened, by which pro∣hibited commodities flowed into the Spanish ter∣ritories, with still more facility, and in greater abundance. This illegal traffic, however detri∣mental to the parent state, contributed to the in∣crease of the settlement, which had the immediate benefit of it, and Buenos-Ayres became gradually a populous and opulent town. What may be the effect of the alteration lately made in the govern∣ment of this colony, the nature of which shall be described in the subsequent Book, cannot hitherto be known.</P>
<P>ALL the other territories of Spain in the New World, the islands excepted,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other ter∣ritories of Spain.</NOTE> of whose discovery and reduction I have formerly given an account, are comprehended under two great divisions; the former denominated the kingdom of Tierra Firme, toe provinces of which stretch along the Atlantic, from the eastern frontier of New Spain to the mouth of the Orinoco; the latter, the New King∣dom of Granada, situated in the interior country. With a short view of these I shall close this part of my work.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="034476_0851_0FFDDCF096319C30"/>TO the east of Veragua, the last province sub∣ject to the viceroy of Mexico, lies the isthmus of Darien. Though it was in this part of the con∣tinent that the Spaniards first began to plant co∣lonies, they have made no considerable progress in peopling it. As the country is extremely moun∣tainous, deluged with rain during a good part of the year, remarkably unhealthful, and contains no mines of great value, the Spaniards would pro∣bably have abandoned it altogether, if they had not been allured to continue by the excellence of the harbour of Porto-bello on the one sea, and that of Panama on the other. These have been called the keys to the communication between the north and south sea, between Spain and her most valuable colonies. In consequence of this advantage, Pa∣nama has become a considerable and thriving town. The peculiar noxiousness of its climate has pre∣vented Porto-bello from increasing in the same pro∣portion. As the intercourse with the settlements in the pacific Ocean is now carried on by another channel, it is probable that both Porto-bello and Panama will decline, when no longer nourished and enriched by that commerce▪ to which they were indebted for their prosperity, and even their existence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carthagena and Santa Martha.</NOTE>THE provinces of Carthagena and Santa Martha stretch to the eastward of the isthmus of Darien. The country still continues mountainous, but its vallies begin to expand, are well watered, and extremely fertile. Pedro de Heredia subjected this part of America to the crown of Spain, about the year 1532. It is thinly peopled, and of course ill cultivated. It produces, however, a variety of valuable drugs, and some precious stones, parti∣cularly emeralds. But its chief importance is de∣rived from the harbour of Carthagena, the safest
<PB N="345" REF="034476_0852_0FFDDCF35D6089D0"/>
and best fortified of any in the American dominions of Spain. In a situation so favourable, commerce soon began to flourish. As early as the year 1544, it seems to have been a town of some note. But when Carthagena was chosen as the port in which the galeons should first begin to trade on their ar∣rival from Europe, and to which they were di∣rected to return, in order to prepare for their voyage homeward, the commerce of its inhabitants was so much favoured by this arrangement, that it soon became one of the most populous, opulent, and beautiful cities in America. There is, how∣ever, reason to apprehend, that it has reached its highest point of exaltation, and that it will be so far affected by the change in the Spanish system of trade with America, which has withdrawn from it the desirable visits of the galeons, as to feel at least a temporary decline. But the wealth now collected there, will soon find or create employment for it∣self, and may be turned with advantage into some new channel. Its harbour is so safe, and so con∣veniently situated for receiving commodities from Europe, its merchants have been so long accus∣tomed to convey these into all the adjacent pro∣vinces, that it is probable they will still retain this branch of trade, and Carthagena continue to be a city of great importance.</P>
<P>THE province contiguous to Santa Martha on the east, was first visited by Alonso de Ojeda,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Venezuela.</NOTE> in the year 1499<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book ii. vol. i. p. 212.</NOTE>; and the Spaniards, on their landing there, having observed some huts in an Indian village built upon piles, in order to raise them above the stagnated water which covered the plain, were led to bestow upon it the name of Venezuela, or Little Venice, by their usual propen∣sity
<PB N="346" REF="034476_0853_0FFDDCFA214F9298"/>
to find a resemblance between what they dis∣covered in America, and the objects which were familiar to them in Europe. They made some at∣tempts to settle there, but with little success. The final reduction of the province was accomplished by means very different from those to which Spain was indebted for its other acquisitions in the New World. The ambition of Charles V. often engaged him in operation of such variety and extent, that his revenues were not sufficient to defray the ex∣pence of carrying them into execution. Among other expedients for supplying the deficiency of his funds, he had borrowed large sums from the Velsers of Augsburgh, the most opulent merchants at that time in Europe. By way of retribution for these, or in hopes, perhaps, of obtaining a new loan, he bestowed upon them the province of Venezuela, to be held as an hereditary fief from the crown of Cas∣tile, on condition that within a limited time they should render themselves masters of the country, and establish a colony there. Under the direction of such persons, it might have been expected, that a settlement would have been established on maxims very different from those of the Spaniards, and bet∣ter calculated to encourage such useful industry, as mercantile proprietors might have known to be the most certain source of prosperity and opulence. But unfortunately they committed the execution of their plan to some of those soldiers of fortune with which Germany abounded in the sixteenth century. These adventurers, impatient to amass riches, that they might speedily abandon a station which they soon discovered to be very uncomfortable, instead of planting a colony in order to cultivate and im∣prove the country, wandered from district to dis∣trict in search of mines, plundering the natives with unfeeling rapacity, or oppressing them by the im∣position
<PB N="347" REF="034476_0854_0FFDDCFBB16EF3F8"/>
of intolerable tasks. In the course of a few years, their avarice and exactions, in compari∣son with which those of the Spaniards were mode∣rate, desolated the province so completely, that it could hardly afford them subsistence, and the Vel∣fers relinquished a property from which the incon∣siderate conduct of their agents left them no hope of ever deriving any advantage<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Civedo y Bagnos Hist. de Venezuela, p. 11, &amp;c.</NOTE>. When the wretched remainder of the Germans deserted Vene∣zuela, the Spaniards again took possession of it; but notwithstanding many natural advantages, it is one of their most languishing and unproductive set∣tlements.</P>

<PB N="348" REF="034476_0855_0FFDDD00F8354C28"/>
surmounted all opposition, though not without en∣countering many dangers, and reduced the country into the form of a Spanish province.</P>
<P>THE New Kingdom of Granada is so far ele∣vated above the level of the sea, that though it approaches almost to the equator, the climate is remarkably temperate. The fertility of its vallies is not inferior to that of the richest districts in America, and its higher grounds yield gold and precious stones of various kinds. It is not by digging into the bowels of the earth that this gold is found; it is mingled with the soil near the sur∣face, and separated from it by repeated washing with water. This operation is carried on wholly by negro slaves; for though the chill subterranean air has been discovered, by experience, to be so fatal to them, that they cannot be employed with advantage in the deep silver mines, they are more capable of performing the other species of labour than Indians. As the natives in the New Kingdom of Granada are exempt from that service, which has wasted their race so rapidly in other parts of Ame∣rica, the country is still remarkably populous. Some districts yield gold with a profusion no less wonderful than that in the vale of Cineguilla, which I have formerly mentioned, and it is often found in large <HI>pepitas,</HI> or grains, which manifest the abundance in which it is produced. On a rising ground near Pampalona, single labourers have col∣lected in a day what was equal in value to a thou∣sand pesos<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Piedrahita Hist. del. N. Reyno, p. 481. MS. penes me.</NOTE>. A late governor of Santa Fé brought with him to Spain a lump of pure gold, estimated to be worth seven hundred and forty pounds ster∣ling. This, which is, perhaps, the largest and finest specimen ever found in the New World, is
<PB N="349" REF="034476_0856_0FFDDD0740C334A8"/>
now deposited in the royal cabinet of Madrid. But without founding any calculation on what is rare and extraordinary, the value of the gold usually collected in this country, particularly in the pro∣vinces of Popayan and Choco, is of considerable amount. Its towns are populous and flourishing. The number of inhabitants in almost every part of the country daily increases. Cultivation and in∣dustry of various kinds begin to be encouraged, and to prosper. A considerable trade is carried on with Carthagena, the produce of the mines, and other commodities, being conveyed down the great river of St. Magdalen to that city. On another quarter, the New Kingdom of Granada has a com∣munication with the Atlantic by the river Orinoco; but the country which stretches along its banks to∣wards the east, is little known, and imperfectly oc∣cupied by the Spaniards.</P>

The effect of their set∣tlements upon the countries of which they took possession, the maxims which they adopted in forming their new colonies, the interior structure and policy of these, together with the influence of their progressive improvement upon the parent state, and upon the commercial intercourse of na∣tions, are the objects to which we now turn our attention.</P>
<P>THE first visible consequence of the establish∣ments made by the Spaniards in America,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Depopula∣tion of A∣merica the first effect of them.</NOTE> was the diminution of the ancient inhabitants, to a degree equally astonishing and deplorable. I have already, on different occasions, mentioned the disastrous influence under which the connection of the Ame∣ricans

with the people of our hemisphere com∣menced, both in the islands, and in several parts of the continent, and have touched upon various causes of their rapid consumption. Wherever the inhabitants of America had resolution to take arms in defence of their liberty and rights, many perished in the unequal contest, and were cut off by their fierce invaders. But the greatest desolation fol∣lowed after the sword was sheathed, and the con∣querors were settled in tranquillity.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Causes of this in the islands, and some parts of the con∣tinent.</NOTE> It was in the islands, and in those provinces of the continent which stretch from the Gulf of Trinidad to the confines of Mexico, that the fatal effects of the Spanish dominion were first and most sensibly felt. All these were occupied either by wandering tribes of hunters, or by such as had made but small pro∣gress in cultivation and industry. When they were compelled by their new masters to take up a fixed residence, and to apply to regular labour; when tasks were imposed upon them disproportioned to their strength, and were exacted with unrelenting severity, they possessed not vigour either of mind or of body to sustain this unusual load of oppres∣sion. Dejection and despair drove many to end their lives by violence. Fatigue and famine de∣stroyed more. In all those extensive regions, the original race of inhabitants wasted away; in some it was totally extinguished. In Mexico, where a powerful and martial people distinguished their op∣position to the Spaniards by efforts of courage wor∣thy of a better fate, great numbers fell in the field; and there, as well as in Peru, still greater numbers perished under the hardships of attending the Spa∣nish armies in their various expeditions and civil wars, worn out with the incessant toil of carrying their baggage, provisions, and military stores.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">In New Spain and Peru.</NOTE>BUT neither the rage nor cruelty of the Spa∣niards were so destructive to the people of Mexico
<PB N="353" REF="034476_0859_0FFDDD0E44FFEC28"/>
and Peru, as the inconsiderate policy with which they established their new settlements. The for∣mer were temporary calamities, fatal to individuals; the latter was a permanent evil, which, with gra∣dual consumption, wasted the nation. When the provinces of Mexico and Peru were divided among the conquerors, each was eager to obtain a district, from which he might expect an instantaneous re∣compence for all his services. Soldiers, accustomed to the carelessness and dissipation of a military life, had neither industry to carry on any plan of regu∣lar cultivation, nor patience to wait for its slow but certain returns, Instead of settling in the val∣lies occupied by the natives, where the fertility of the soil would have amply rewarded the diligence of the planter, they chose to fix their stations in some of the mountainous regions, frequent both in New Spain and in Peru. To search for mines of gold and silver, was the chief object of their acti∣vity. The prospects which this opens, and the alluring hopes which it continually presents corre∣spond wonderfully with the spirit of enterprize and adventure that animated the first emigrants to Ame∣rica in every part of their conduct. In order to push forward those favourite projects, so many hands were wanted, that the service of the natives became indispensably requisite. They were ac∣cordingly compelled to abandon their ancient ha∣bitations in the plains, and driven in crowds to the mountains. This sudden transition from the sultry climate of the vallies, to the chill penetrating air peculiar to high lands in the torrid zone; exorbi∣tant labour, scanty or unwholesome nourishment, and the despondency occasioned by a species of op∣pression to which they were not accustomed, and of which they saw no end, affected them nearly as much as their less industrious countrymen in the
<PB N="354" REF="034476_0860_0FFDDD10E0351A18"/>
islands. They sunk under the united pressure of those calamities, and melted away with almost equal rapidity<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Torquemada, i. 613.</NOTE>. In consequence of this, together with the introduction of the small-pox, a malady unknown in America, and extremely fatal to the natives<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">B. Diaz. c. 124.

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Not the re∣sult of any system of policy</NOTE>SUCH are the most considerable events and causes which, by their combined operation, contributed to depopulate America. Without attending to these, many authors, astonished at the suddenness of the desolation, have ascribed this unexampled event to a system of policy no less profound than atrocious. The Spaniards, as they pretend, con∣scious of their own inability to occupy the vast regions which they had discovered, and foreseeing the impossibility of maintaining their authority over a people infinitely superior to themselves in num∣ber, in order to preserve the possession of America, resolved to exterminate the inhabitants, and by con∣verting a great part of the country into a desert, en∣deavoured to secure their own dominion over it<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXIX.</NOTE>. But nations seldom extend their views to objects so remote, or lay their plans so deep; and, for the honour of humanity we may observe, that no na∣tion ever deliberately formed such an execrable scheme. The Spanish monarchs, far from acting upon any such system of destruction, were uniformly solicitous for the preservation of their new subjects. With Isabella, zeal for propagating the Christian
<PB N="355" REF="034476_0861_0FFDDD1381DE9788"/>
faith, together with the desire of communicating the knowledge of truth, and the consolations of religion, to people destitute of spiritual light, were more than ostensible motives for encouraging Co∣lumbus to attempt his discoveries. Upon his suc∣cess, she endeavoured to fulfil her pious purpose, and manifested the most tender concern to secure not only religious instruction, but mild treatment, to that inoffensive race of men subjected to her crown<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXX.</NOTE>. Her successors adopted the same ideas; and, on many occasions, which I have mentioned, their authority was interposed in the most vigorous exertions, to protect the people of America from the oppression of their Spanish subjects. Their re∣gulations for this purpose were numerous, and often repeated. They were framed with wisdom, and dictated by humanity. After their possessions in the New World became so extensive, as might have excited some apprehension of difficulty in retaining their dominion over them, the spirit of their regu∣lations was as mild as when their settlements were confined to the islands alone. Their solicitude to protect the Indians seems rather to have augmented as their acquisitions increased; and from ardour to accomplish this, they enacted, and endeavoured to enforce the execution of laws, which excited a for∣midable rebellion in one of their colonies, and spread alarm and disaffection through all the rest. But the avarice of individuals was too violent to be con∣trouled by the authority of laws. Rapacious and daring adventurers, far removed from the seat of government, little accustomed to the restraints of military discipline while in service, and still less disposed to respect the feeble jurisdiction of civil power in an infant colony, despised or eluded every
<PB N="356" REF="034476_0862_0FFDDD15676CB278"/>
regulation that set bounds to their exactions and tyranny. The parent state, with persevering atten∣tion, issued edicts to prevent the oppression of the Indians, the colonists, regardless of these, or trust∣ing to their distance for impunity, continued to consider and treat them as slaves. The governors themselves, and other officers employed in the co∣lonies, several of whom were as indigent and rapa∣cious as the adventurers over whom they presided, were too apt to adopt their contemptuouts ideas of the conquered people; and instead of checking, en∣couraged or connived at their excesses. The deso∣lation of the New World should not then be charged on the court of Spain, or be considered as the effect of any system of policy adopted there. It ought to be imputed wholly to the indigent and often un∣principled adventurers, whose fortune it was to be the conquerors and first planters of America, who, by measures no less inconsiderate than unjust, coun∣teracted the edicts of their sovereign, and have brought disgrace upon their country.</P>

of the humane and persevering zeal of the Spanish missionaries, in protecting the helpless flock com∣mitted to their charge, they appear in a light which reflects lustre upon their function. They were mi∣nisters of peace, who endeavoured to wrest the rod from the hands of oppressors. To their powerful interposition, the Americans were indebted for every regulation tending to mitigate the rigour of their fate. The clergy in the Spanish settlements, regu∣lar as well as secular, are still considered by the Indians as their natural guardians, to whom they have recourse under the hardships and exactions to which they are too often exposed<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The num∣ber of the Indians still remaining.</NOTE> notwithstanding the rapid depopulation of America, a very considerable number of the native race still remains both in Mexico and Peru, espe∣cially in those parts which were not exposed to the first fury of the Spanish arms, or desolated by the first efforts of their industry, still more ruinous. In Guatimala, Chiapa, Nicaragua, and the other delightful provinces of the Mexican empire, which stretch along the South-sea, the race of Indians is still numerous. Their settlements in some places are so populous, as to merit the name of cities<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXII.</NOTE>.

stations in society. As the inhabitants both of Mexico and Peru were accustomed to a fixed residence, and to a certain degree of regular in∣dustry, less violence was requisite in bringing them to some conformity with the European modes of civil life. But wherever the Spaniards settled among the savage tribes of America, their attempts to incorporate with them have been always fruitless, and often fatal to the natives. Impatient of re∣straint, and disdaining labour as a mark of servility, they either abandoned their original seats, and sought for independence in mountains and forests inacces∣sible to their oppressors, or perished when reduced to a state repugnant to their ancient ideas and ha∣bits. In the districts adjacent to Carthagena, to Panama, and to Buenos-Ayres, the desolation is more general than even in those parts of Mexico and Peru, of which the Spaniards have taken most full possession.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">General ideas of the policy of Spain in its colonies.</NOTE>BUT the establishments of the Spaniards in the New World, though fatal to its ancient inhabit∣ants, were made at a period when that monarchy was capable of forming them to best advantage. By the union of all its petty kingdoms, Spain was become a powerful state, equal to so great an un∣dertaking. Its monarchs, having extended their prerogative far beyond the limits which once cir∣cumscribed the regal power in every kingdom of Europe, were hardly subject to controul, either in concerting or in executing their measures. In every wide extended empire, the form of govern∣ment must be simple, and the sovereign authority such, that its resolutions may be taken with promp∣titude, and may pervade the whole with sufficient force. Such was the power of the Spanish mo∣narchs, when they were called to deliberate concern∣ing the mode of establishing their dominion over
<PB N="359" REF="034476_0865_0FFDDD1E75F66460"/>
the most remote provinces, which had ever been subjected to any European state. In this delibera∣tion, they felt themselves under no constitutional restraint, and that, as independent masters of their own resolves, they might issue the edicts requisite for modelling the government of the new colonies, by a mere act of prerogative.</P>
<P>THIS early interposition of the Spanish crown,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Early inter∣position of the regal authority.</NOTE> in order to regulate the policy and trade of its co∣lonies, is a peculiarity which distinguishes their progress from that of the colonies of any other European nation. When the Portuguese, the Eng∣lish, and French, took possession of the regions in America which they now occupy, the advantages which these promised to yield were so remote and uncertain, that their colonies were suffered to struggle through a hard infancy, almost without guidance or protection from the parent state. But gold and silver, the first productions of the Spanish settlements in the New World, were more alluring, and immediately attracted the attention of their mo∣narchs. Though they had contributed little to the discovery, and almost nothing to the conquest of the New World, they instantly assumed the func∣tion of its legislators; and having acquired a spe∣cies of dominion formerly unknown, they formed a plan for exercising it, to which nothing similar occurs in the history of human affairs.</P>
<P>THE fundamental maxim of Spanish jurispru∣dence with respect to America,<NOTE PLACE="marg">All power and proper∣ty vested in the crown.</NOTE> is to consider what has been acquired there as vested in the crown rather than in the state. By the bull of Alex∣ander VI. on which, as its great charter, Spain founded its right, all the regions that had been, or should be discovered, were bestowed as a free gift upon Ferdinand and Isabella. They and their successors were uniformly held to be the universal
<PB N="360" REF="034476_0866_0FFDDD21181B6300"/>
proprietors of the vast territories, which the arms of their subjects conquered in the New World. From them, all grants of land there flowed, and to them they finally returned. The leaders who conducted the various expeditions, the governors who pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sided over the different colonies, the offi∣cers of justice, and the ministers of religion, were all appointed by their authority, and removable at their pleasure. The people who composed infant settlements were entitled to no privileges inde∣pendent of the sovereign, or that served as a barrier against the power of the crown. It is true, that when towns were built, and formed into bodies corporate, the citizens were permitted to elect their own magistrates, who governed them by laws which the community enacted. Even in the most despotic states, this feeble spark of liberty is not ex∣tinguished. But in the cities of Spanish America, this jurisdiction is merely municipal, and is con∣fined to the regulation of their own interior com∣merce and police. In whatever relates to public government, and the general interest, the will of the sovereign is law. No political power originates from the people. All centers in the crown, and in the officers of its nomination.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">All the new domi∣nions of Spain sub∣jected to two vice toys.</NOTE>WHEN the conquests of the Spaniards in Ame∣rica were completed, their monarchs, in forming the plan of internal policy for their new dominions, divided them into two immense governments, one subject to the viceroy of New Spain, the other to the viceroy of Peru.

when the remote provinces of each vice∣royalty began to improve in industry and popula∣tion. The people complained or their subjection to a superior, whose place of residence was so dis∣tant, or so inaccessible, as almost excluded them from any intercourse with the seat of government. The authority of the viceroy over districts so far removed from his own eye and observation, was unavoidably both feeble and ill directed. As a remedy for those evils, a third viceroyalty has been established in the present century, at Santo Fé de Bogota, the capital of the new kingdom of Gra∣nada, the jurisdiction of which extends over the whole kingdom of Tierra Firmè, and the province of Quito.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. de Ulloa, i. 23, 255.</NOTE> Those viceroys not only represent the person of their sovereign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Their powers.</NOTE> but possess his regal pre∣rogatives within the precincts of their own govern∣ments, in their utmost extent.

They have the sole right of nominating the persons who hold many offices of the highest importance, and the oc∣casional privilege of supplying those which, when they become vacant by death, are in the royal gift, until the successor appointed by the king shall ar∣rive. The external pomp of their government is suited to its real dignity and power. Their courts are formed upon the model of that at Madrid, with horse and foot guards, a household regularly esta∣blished, numerous attendants, and ensigns of com∣mand, displaying such magnificence, as hardly re∣tains the appearance of delegated authority.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ulloa, Voy. i. 432.

But as legal restraints on a person who represents the sovereign, and is clothed with his authority, are little suited to the genius of Spanish policy; the hesitation and reserve with which it confers this power on the courts of Audience are remarkable.

To enumerate the various subordi∣nate boards and officers employed in the administra∣tion of justice, in collecting the public revenue, and in regulating the interior police of the country; to describe their different functions, and to enquire into the mode and effect of their operations; would prove a detail no less intricate than minute, and uninteresting.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">First object to secu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e an exclusive trade.</NOTE>THE first object of the Spanish monarchs was to secure the productions of the colonies to the parent state, by an absolute prohibition of any intercourse with foreign nations. They took possession of America by right of conquest, and conscious not only of the feebleness of their infant settlements, but aware of the difficulty in establishing their do∣minion over regions so extensive, or in retaining so many reluctant nations under the yoke, they dreaded the intrusion of strangers; they even shun∣ned their inspection, and endeavoured to keep them at a distance from their coasts. This spirit of jealousy and exclusion, which at first was natural, and per∣haps necessary, augmented as their possessions in America extended, and the value of them came to be more fully understood. In consequence of it, a system of colonizing was introduced, to which there had hitherto been nothing similar among mankind. In the ancient world, it was not uncom∣mon to send forth colonies. But they were of two kinds only. They were either migrations, which served to disburden a state of its superfluous sub∣jects, when they multiplied too fast for the terri∣tory which they occupied; or they were military detachments, stationed as garrisons in a conquered province. The colonies of some Greek republics, and the swarms of northern barbarians which settled
<PB N="367" REF="034476_0873_0FFDDD32A9C45E18"/>
in different parts of Europe, were of the first species. The Roman colonies were of the second. In the former, the connection with the mother-country quickly ceased, and they became independent states. In the latter, as the disjunction was not complete, the dependence continued. In their American settlements,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Regulati∣ons for that pur∣pose.</NOTE> the Spanish monarchs took what was peculiar to each, and studied to unite them. By sending colonies to regions so remote, by establish∣ing in each a form of interior policy and administra∣tion, under distinct governors, and with peculiar laws, they disjoined them from the mother-country. By retaining in their own hands the rights of legis∣lation, as well as that of imposing taxes, together with the power of nominating the persons who filled every department of executive government, civil or military, they secured their dependence upon the parent state. Happily for Spain, the situ∣ation of her colonies was such, as rendered it possible to reduce this new idea into practice. Almost all the countries which she had discovered and occu∣pied, lay within the tropics. The productions of that large portion of the globe are different from those of Europe, even in its most southern provinces. The qualities of the climate and of the soil natu∣rally turn the industry of such as settle there into new channels. When the Spaniards first took pos∣session of their dominions in America, the precious metals which they yielded, were the only object that attracted their attention. Even when their efforts began to take a better direction, they employed themselves almost wholly in rearing such peculiar productions of the climate, as, from their rarity or value, were of chief demand in the mother-country. Allured by vast prospects of immediate wealth, they disdained to waste their industry on what was less lucrative, but of superior moment.
<PB N="368" REF="034476_0874_0FFDDD366F1B5380"/>
In order to render it impossible to correct this error, and to prevent them from making any efforts in industry which might interfere with those of the mother-country, the establishment of several species of manufactures, and even the culture of the vine, or olive, are prohibited in the Spanish colonies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXV.</NOTE>, under severe penalties<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">B. Ulloa Retab. des Manuf. &amp;c. p. 206.</NOTE>. They must trust entirely to the mother-country for the objects of primary necessity. Their clothes, their furniture, their in∣struments of labour, their luxuries, and even a con∣siderable part of the provisions which they consume, were imported from Spain. During a great part of the sixteenth century, Spain, possessing an ex∣tensive commerce and flourishing manufactures, could supply with ease the growing demands of her colonies, from her own stores. The produce of their mines and plantations was given in exchange for these. But all that the colonies received, as well as all that they gave, was conveyed in Spanish bottoms. No vessel belonging to the colonies was ever permitted to carry the commodities of Ame∣rica to Europe. Even the commercial intercourse of one colony with another, was either absolutely prohibited, or limited by many jealous restrictions. All that America yields flows into the ports of Spain; all that it consumes must issue from them. No foreigner can enter its colonies without express permission; no vessel of any foreign nation is re∣ceived into their harbours; and the pains of death, with confiscation of moveables, are denounced against every inhabitant who presumes to trade with them<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Recopil. lib. ix. tit. xxvii. l. i. 4, 7, &amp;c.</NOTE>. Thus the colonies are kept in a state of perpetual pupillage; and by the introduction of this

commercial dependence, a refinement in policy of which Spain set the first example to the European nations, the supremacy of the parent state hath been maintained over remote colonies during two cen∣turies and a half.</P>
<P>SUCH are the capital maxims to which the Spa∣nish monarchs seem to have attended in forming their new settlements in America.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Slow pro∣gress of po∣pulation from Eu∣rope.</NOTE> But they could not plant with the same rapidity that they had de∣stroyed; and from many concurring causes, their progress has been extremely slow, in filling up the immense void which their devastations had occa∣sioned. As soon as the rage for discovery and ad∣venture began to abate, the Spaniards opened their eyes to dangers and distresses, which at first they did not perceive, or had despised. The numerous hardships with which the members of infant colo∣nies have to struggle, the diseases of unwholesome climates, fatal to the constitution of Europeans; the difficulty of bringing a country, covered with fo∣rests, into culture; the want of hands necessary for labour in some provinces, and the slow reward of industry, in all unless where the accidental discovery of mines enriched a few fortunate adventurers, were evils universally felt and magnified. Discouraged by the view of these, the spirit of migration was so much damped, that sixty years after the discovery of the New World, the number of Spaniards in all its provinces is computed not to have exceeded fifteen thousand<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE mode in which property was distributed in the Spanish colonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Discourag∣ed by the state of property.</NOTE> and the regulations established with respect to the transmission of it, whether by descent or by sale, were extremely unfavourable to population.

of people in any new settlement, property in land ought to be divided into small shares, and the alienation of it should be rendered extremely easy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Smith's Inquiry, ii. 166.</NOTE>. But the rapaciousness of the Spanish conquerors of the New World paid no regard to this fundamental maxim of policy; and as they possessed power, which enabled them to gratify the utmost extrava∣gance of their wishes, many seized districts of great extent, and held them as <HI>encomiendas.</HI> By degrees they obtained the privilege of converting a part of these into <HI>Mayorasges,</HI> a species of fief, introduced into the Spanish system of feudal jurisprudence<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Recop. lib. iv. tit. iii l. 24.</NOTE>, which can neither be divided nor alienated. Thus a great portion of landed property, under this rigid form of entail, is withheld from circulation, and de∣scends from father to son unimproved, and of little value either to the proprietor or to the community. In the account which I have given of the reduction of Peru, various examples occur of enormous tracts of country occupied by some of the conquerors<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Book vi. p. 139.</NOTE>. The excesses in other provinces were similar, for as the value of the lands which the Spaniards ac∣quired, was originally estimated according to the number of Indians which lived upon them, Ame∣rica was in general so thinly peopled, that only dis∣tricts of great extent could afford such a number of labourers as might be employed in the mines with any prospect of considerable gain. The pernicious effects of those radical errors in the distribution and nature of property in the Spanish settlements, are felt through every department of industry, and may be considered as one great cause of a progress in population so much slower than that which has taken place in better constituted colonies<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXVII.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="034476_0877_0FFDDD3E4BD1FC58"/>TO this we may add, that the support of the enormous and expensive fabric of their ecclesiastical establishment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and the na∣ture of their ecclesiasti∣cal policy.</NOTE> has been a burden on the Spanish colonies, which has greatly retarded the progress of population and industry. The payment of tithes is a heavy tax on industry; and if the exaction of them be not regulated and circumscribed by the wisdom of the civil magistrate, it becomes intole∣rable and ruinous. But, instead of any restraint on the claims of ecclesiastics, the inconsiderate zeal of the Spanish legislators admitted them into America in their full extent, and at once imposed on their infant colonies a burden which is in no slight degree oppressive to society, even in its most improved state. As early as the year 1501, the payment of tithes in the colonies was enjoined, and the mode of it regulated by law. Every article of primary necessity, towards which the attention of new set∣tlers must naturally be turned, is subjected to that grievous exaction<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Recop. lib. i. tit xiv. l. 2.</NOTE>. Nor were the demands of the clergy confined to articles of simple and easy cul∣ture. Its more artificial and operose productions, such as sugar, indigo, and cochineal, were soon de∣clared to be tithable<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Recop. lib i. tit. xiv. l. 3 &amp; 4.</NOTE>; and thus the industry of the planter was taxed in every stage of its progress, from its rudest essay to its highest improvement. To the weight of this legal imposition, the bigotry of the American Spaniards has made many volun∣tary additions. From their fond delight in the external pomp and parade of religion, and from superstitious reverence for ecclesiastics of every de∣nomination, they have bestowed profuse donatives on churches and monasteries, and have unprofitably wasted a large proportion of that wealth, which might have nourished and given vigour to pro∣ductive labour in growing colonies.</P>

some of the Creolian race are descended from the conquerors of the New World; though others can trace up their pedigree to the noblest families in Spain; though many are possessed of ample for∣tunes, yet, by the enervating influence of a sultry climate, by the rigour of a jealous government, and by their despair of attaining that distinction to which mankind naturally aspire, the vigour of their minds is so entirely broken, that a great part of them waste life in luxurious indulgencies, mingled with an illiberal superstition still more debasing. Languid and unenterprising, the operations of an active extend∣ed commerce would be to them so cumbersome and oppressive, that in almost every part of America they decline engaging in it. The interior traffic of every colony, as well as any trade which is permit∣ted with the neighbouring provinces, and with Spain itself, are carried on chiefly by the Chapetones<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. de Ulloa, i. 27. 251.

<P>FROM this stated competition for power and wealth between those two orders of citizens,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rivalship between these.</NOTE> and the vari∣ous passions excited by a rivalship so interesting, their hatred is violent and implacable.

Frezier, 226.</NOTE>. The court of Spain, from a refinement of distrustful policy, cherishes those seeds of discord, and foments this mutual jealousy, which not only prevents the two most powerful classes of its subjects in the New World from combining against the parent state, but

But it has been more owing to licentious indulgence, than to compliance with this injunction of their sovereigns, that this mixed breed has multiplied so greatly, as to constitute a considerable part of the population in all the Spanish settlements. The se∣veral stages of descent in this race, and the gradual variations of shade until the African black, or the copper colour of America, brighten into an Euro∣pean complexion, are accurately marked by the Spa∣niards, and each distinguished by a peculiar name. Those of the first and second generations are con∣sidered, and treated as mere Indians and Negroes; but in the third descent, the characteristic hue of the former disappears; and in the fifth, the deeper tint of the latter is so entirely effaced, that they can no longer be distinguished from Europeans, and become entitled to all their privileges<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Voy. de Ulloa, i p. 27.</NOTE>.

In several of their settlements, particularly in New Spain, negroes are mostly employed in do∣mestic service. They form a principal part in the train of luxury, and are cherished and caressed by their superiors, to whose vanity and pleasures they are equally subservient. Their dress and appearance are hardly less splendid than that of their masters, whose manners they imitate, and whose passions they imbibe<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gage, p. 56.

Elevated by this distinction, they have assumed such a tone of superiority over the In∣dians, and treat them with such insolence and scorn, that the antipathy between the two races has become implacable. Even in Peru, where negroes seem to be more numerous, and are employed in field-work as well as domestic service, they maintain their ascendant over the Indians, and the mutual hatred of one to the other subsists with equal violence. The laws have industriously fomented this aversion, to which accident gave rise, and, by most rigorous injunctions, have endeavoured to prevent every in∣tercourse that might form a bond of union between the two races. Thus, by an artful policy, the Spa∣niards derive strength from that circumstance in po∣pulation, which is the weakness of other European

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Indi∣ans form the last or∣der of ci∣tizens.</NOTE>THE Indians form the last, and the most de∣pressed order of men in the country, which be∣longed to their ancestors. I have already traced the progress of the Spanish ideas with respect to the condition and treatment of that people, and have mentioned the most important of their more early regulations, concerning a matter of so much consequence in the administration of their new do∣minions. But since the period to which I have brought down the history of America, the informa∣tion and experience acquired during two centuries, have enabled the court of Spain to make such im∣provements in this part of its American system, that a short view of the present condition of the Indians may prove both curious and interesting.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Their pre∣sent condi∣tion.</NOTE>BY the famous regulations of Charles V. in 1542, which have been so often mentioned, the high pre∣tensions of the conquerors of the New World, who considered its inhabitants as slaves, to whose service they had acquired a full right of property, were finally abrogated. From that period, the Indians have been reputed freemen, and entitled to the privileges of subjects. When admitted into this rank, it was deemed just, that they should contri∣bute towards the support and improvement of the society which had adopted them as members. But as no considerable benefit could be expected from the voluntary efforts of men unacquainted with re∣gular industry, and averse to labour, the court of Spain found it necessary to fix and secure, by proper regulations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Tax im∣posed on them.</NOTE> what it thought reasonable to exact from them. With this view, an annual tax
<PB N="377" REF="034476_0883_0FFDDD4E87342978"/>
was imposed upon every male, from the age of eighteen to fifty; and at the same time, the nature as well as the extent of the services which they might be required to perform, were ascertained with precision. This tribute varies in different provinces; but if we take that paid in New Spain as a medium, its annual amount is nearly four s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>illings a head; no exorbitant sum in countries where, as at the source of wealth, the value of money is extremely low<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXIX. Recopil. lib. vi. tit. v. l. 42. Hack∣luyt, vol. iii. p 461.</NOTE>. The right of levying this tribute likewise varies. In America, every Indian is either an immediate vassal of the crown, or depends upon some subject to whom the district in which he resides has been granted for a limited time, under the denomination of an <HI>encomienda.</HI> In the former case about three-fourths of the tax is paid into the royal treasury; in the latter, the same proportion of it belongs to the holder of the grant. When Spain first took possession of Ame∣rica, the greater part of it was parcelled out among its conquerors, or those who first settled there, and but a small portion reserved for the crown. As those grants which were made for two lives only<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Recopil. lib. vi tit. viii. l. 48.

Those services, however, which can now be legally exacted, are very different from the tasks originally imposed upon the Indians. The nature of the work which they must perform is defined, and an equitable re∣compence is granted for their labour. The stated services demanded of the Indians may be divided into two branches. They are either employed in works of primary necessity, without which society cannot subsist comfortably, or are compelled to labour in the mines, from which the Spanish co∣lonies derive their chief value and importance. In consequence of the former, they are obliged to assist in the culture of maize, and other grain of ne∣cessary consumption; in tending cattle; in erecting edifices of public utility; in building bridges; and in forming high roads<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Recopil lib. vi. tit xiii. l. 19.

<P>THE Indians who live in the principal towns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How go∣verned.</NOTE>
are entirely subject to the Spanish laws and magi∣strates; but in their own villages, they are go∣verned by Caziques, some of whom are the de∣scendants of their ancient lords, others are named by the Spanish viceroys. These regulate the petty affairs of the people under them according to maxims of justice, transmitted to them by tradition from their ancestors. To the Indians, this juris∣diction, lodged in such friendly hands, affords some consolation; and so little formidable is this dignity to their new masters, that they often allow it to de∣scend by hereditary right<NOTE N="**" PLACE="foot">Solorz de Jure Ind. lib. i. c. 26.

<P>SUCH are the leading principles in the jurispru∣dence and policy by which the Indians are now go∣verned in the provinces belonging to Spain. In those regulations of the Spanish monarchs, we dis∣cover no traces of that cruel system of extermina∣tion, which they have been charged with adopting; and if we admit, that the necessity of securing sub∣sistence for their colonies, or the advantages de∣rived from working the mines, give them a right to avail themselves of the labour of the Indians, we must allow, that the attention with which they re∣gulate and recompence that labour, is provident and
<PB N="381" REF="034476_0887_0FFDDD028B5CB8D0"/>
sagacious. In no code of laws is greater solicitude displayed, or precautions multiplied with more pru∣dent concern for the preservation, the security, and the happiness of the subject, than we discover in the collection of the Spanish laws for the Indies. But those later regulations, like the more early edicts which have been already mentioned, have too often proved ineffectual remedies against the evils which they were intended to prevent. In every age, if the same causes continue to operate, the same effects must follow. From the immense distance between the power entrusted with the execution of laws, and that by whose authority they are enacted, the vigour even of the most absolute government must relax, and the dread of a superior, too remote to observe with accuracy, or to punish with dispatch, must in∣sensibly abate. Notwithstanding the numerous in∣junctions of the Spanish monarch, the Indians still suffer on many occasions, both from the avarice of individuals, and from the exactions of the magis∣trates, who ought to have protected them; unrea∣sonable tasks are imposed; the term of their labour is prolonged beyond the period fixed by law, and they groan under many of the insults and wrongs which are the lot of a dependent people<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXXIV.</NOTE>. From some information on which I can depend, such op∣pression abounds more in Peru, than any other co∣lony. But it is not general. According to the ac∣counts, even of those authors who are most dispo∣sed to exaggerate the sufferings of the Indians, they, in several provinces, enjoy not only ease, but afflu∣ence; they possess large farms; they are masters of numerous herds and flocks: and by the knowledge which they have acquired of European arts and in∣dustry, are supplied not only with the necessaries, but with many luxuries of life<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gage's Survey, p. 85, 90, 104, 119, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>

Notwithstanding the superstitious veneration with which the Spaniards are devoted to the Holy See, the vigilant and jealous policy of Ferdinand early prompted him to take precautions against the in∣troduction of the papal dominion into America. With this view,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Restraints on the pa∣pal juris∣diction.</NOTE> he solicited Alexander VI. for a grant to the crown of the tithes in all the newly-discovered countries<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Bulla Alex. vi.

Soon after Julius II. con∣ferred on him, and his successors, the right of pa∣tronage, and the absolute disposal of all ecclesiastical benefices there<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Bulla Julii, ii. 1508, ap Solorz de Jure Ind. ii. 509.</NOTE>. But these pontiffs, unacquainted with the value of what he demanded, bestowed those donations with an inconsiderate liberality, which their successors have often lamented, and wished to recal. In consequence of those grants, the Spanish monarchs have become in effect the heads of the American church. In them the ad∣ministration of its revenues is vested. Their no∣mination of persons to supply vacant benefices is instantly confirmed by the pope. Thus, in all Spanish America, authority of every species centers in the crown. There no collision is known be∣tween spiritual and temporal jurisdiction. The king is the only superior, his name alone is heard of, and no dependence upon any foreign power has been introduced. Papal bulls cannot be admitted into America, nor are they of any force there, until they have been previously examined, and approved

<P>THE hierarchy as established in America in the same form is in Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Form and endow∣ments of the church in the Spa∣nish colo∣nies.</NOTE> with its full train of arch∣bishops, bishops, deans, and other dignitaries. The inferior clergy are divided into three classes, under the denomination of <HI>Curas, Doctrineros,</HI> and <HI>Mis∣sioneros.</HI> The first are parish-priests in those parts of the country where the Spaniards have settled. The second have the charge of such districts as are inhabited by Indians subjected to the Spanish go∣vernment, and living under its protection. The third are employed in instructing and converting those fiercer tribes, which disdain submission to the Spanish yoke, and live in remote or inaccessible regions, to which the Spanish arms have not pe∣netrated. So numerous are the ecclesiastics of all those various orders, and such the profuse liberality with which many of them are endowed, that the revenues of the church in America are immense. The Romish superstition appears with its utmost pomp in the New World. Churches and convents
<PB N="384" REF="034476_0890_0FFDDCEA4D607040"/>
there are magnificent, and richly adorned; and on high festivals, the display of gold and silver, and precious stones, is such as exceeds the conception of an European<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. de Ulloa, i. 430.</NOTE>. An ecclesiastical establishment so splendid and expensive, is unfavourable, as has been formerly observed, to the progress of rising colonies; but in countries where riches abound, and the peo∣ple are so delighted with parade, that religion must assume it, in order to attract their veneration, this propensity to ostentation has been indulged, and becomes less pernicious.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Pernicious effects of monastic institutions.</NOTE>THE early institution of monasteries in the Spa∣nish colonies, and the inconsiderate zeal in multi∣plying them, have been attended with consequences more fatal. In every new settlement, the first ob∣ject should be to encourage population, and to in∣cite every citizen to contribute towards augment∣ing the number and strength of the community. During the youth and vigour of society, while there is room to spread, and sustenance is procured with facility, mankind increase with amazing rapidity. But the Spaniards had hardly taken possession of America, when with a most preposterous policy, they began to erect convents, where persons of both sexes were shut up, under a vow to defeat the pur∣pose of nature, and to counteract the first of her laws. Influenced by a misguided piety, which ascribes transcendant merit to a state of celibacy, or allured by the prospect of that listless ease, which, in sultry climates, is deemed supreme felicity, num∣bers crowded into those mansions of sloth and su∣perstition, and are lost to society. As none but persons of Spanish extract are admitted into the monasteries of the New World, the evil is more sensibly felt, and every monk or nun may be con∣sidered
<PB N="385" REF="034476_0891_0FFDDCE5F5ECEA98"/>
as an active person withdrawn from civil life. The impropriety of such foundations in any situation where the extent of territory requires ad∣ditional hands to improve it, is so obvious, that some catholic states have expressly prohibited any person in their colonies from taking the monastic vows<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. de Ulloa, ii. 124.</NOTE>. Even the Spanish monarchs, on some oc∣casions, seem to have been alarmed with the spread∣ing of a spirit so adverse to the increase and pros∣perity of their colonies, that they have endeavoured to check it<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Herrera, dec. v. lib ix. c. 1, 2. Recop. lib. i. tit. iii. l. 1, 2. tit. iv c ii. Solorz. lib. iii. c. 23.</NOTE>. But the Spaniards in America, more thoroughly under the influence of superstition than their countrymen in Europe, and directed by ec∣clesiastics more bigotted and illiterate, have con∣ceived such an high opinion of monastic sanctity, that no regulations can restrain their zeal; and, by the excess of their ill-judged bounty, religious houses have multiplied to a degree no less amazing than pernicious to society<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXXV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN viewing the state of colonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Character of ecclesi∣astics in Spanish A∣merica,</NOTE> where not only the number but influence of ecclesiastics is so great, the character of this powerful body is an object that merits particular attention. A considerable part of the secular clergy in Mexico and Peru are natives of Spain. As persons long accustomed, by their education, to the retirement and indolence of aca∣demic life, are more incapable of active enterprize, and less disposed to strike into new paths, than any order of men, the ecclesiastical adventurers by whom the American church is recruited, are commonly such as, from merit or rank in life, have little pro∣spect of success in their own country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">of the se∣cula<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</NOTE> According∣ly, the secular priests in the New World, are still
<PB N="386" REF="034476_0892_0FFDDD5A9159ECD0"/>
less distinguished than their brethern in Spain, for literary accomplishments of any species; and though by the ample provision which has been made for the American church, many of its members enjoy the ease and independence which are favourable to the cultivation of science, the body of secular clergy has hardly, during two centuries and a half, pro∣duced one author whose works convey such useful information, or possess such a degree of merit, as to be ranked among those which attract the atten∣tion of enlightened nations.<NOTE PLACE="marg">of the re∣gulars.</NOTE> But the greatest part of the ecclesiastics in the Spanish settlements are regulars. On the discovery of America, a new field opened to the pious zeal of the monastic or∣ders; and, with a becoming alacrity, they imme∣diately sent forth missionaries to labour in it. The first attempt to instruct and convert the Americans, was made by monks; and, as soon as the conquest of any province was completed, and its ecclesiasti∣cal establishment began to assume some form, the popes permitted the missionaries of the four mendi∣cant orders, as a reward for their services, to ac∣cept of parochial charges in America, to perform all spiritual functions, and to receive the tithes, and other emoluments of the benefice, without de∣pending on the jurisdiction of the bishop of the diocese, or being subject to his censures. In con∣sequence of this, a new career of usefulness, as well as new objects of ambition presented themselves. Whenever a call is made for a fresh supply of mis∣sionaries, men of the most ardent and aspiring minds, impatient under the restraint of a cloister, weary of its insipid uniformity, and fatigued with the irksome repetition of its frivolous functions, offer their service with eagerness, and repair to the New World in quest of liberty and distinction. Nor do they pursue distinction without success. The
<PB N="387" REF="034476_0893_0FFDDCE35B621608"/>
highest ecclesiastical honours, as well as the most lucrative preferments in Mexico and Peru, are often in the hands of regulars; and it is chiefly to the monastic orders that the Americans are in∣debted for any portion of science which is culti∣vated among them. They are almost the only Spanish ecclesiastics, from whom we have received any accounts, either of the civil or natural history of the various provinces in America. Some of them, though deeply tinged with the indelible su∣perstition of their profession, have published books which give a favourable idea of their abilities. The natural and moral history of the New World, by the Jesuit Acosta, contains more accurate obser∣vations, perhaps, a more sound science, than are to be found in any description of remote countries published in the sixteenth century.</P>
<P>BUT the same disgust with monastic life,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Dissolute manners of some of them.</NOTE> to which America is indebted for some instructors of worth and abilities, filled it with others of a very different character. The giddy, the profligate, the avari∣cious, to whom the poverty and rigid discipline of a convent are intolerable, consider a mission to America as a release from mortification and bond∣age. There they soon obtain some parochial charge, and far removed, by their situation, from the inspection of their monastic superiors, and ex∣empt, by their character, from the jurisdiction of their diocesan<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Avendano Thes. Indie. ii. 253.</NOTE>, they are hardly subject to any controul. According to the testimony of the most zealous catholics, many of the regular clergy in the Spanish settlements are not only destitute of the virtues becoming their profession, but regard∣less of that external decorum and respect for the opinion of mankind, which preserve a resemblance
<PB N="388" REF="034476_0894_0FFDDC6CB92D3500"/>
of worth where the reality is wanting. Secure of impunity, some regulars, in contempt of their vow of poverty, engage openly in commerce; and are so rapaciously eager in amassing wealth, that they become the most grievous oppressors of the Indians, whom it was their duty to have protected. Others, with no less flagrant violation of their vow of chastity, indulge with little disguise in the most dissolute licentiousness<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXXVI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>VARIOUS schemes have been proposed for re∣dressing enormities so manifest and so offensive. Several persons, no less eminent for piety than dis∣cernment, have contended, that the regulars, in conformity to the canons of the church, ought to be confined within the walls of their cloisters, and should no longer be permitted to encroach on the functions of the secular clergy. Some public-spirited magistrates, from conviction of its being necessary to deprive the regulars of a privilege be∣stowed at first with good intention, but of which time and experience had discovered the pernicious effects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1618.</NOTE> openly countenanced the secular clergy in their attempts to assert their own rights. The prince D'Esquilache, viceroy of Peru under Philip III. took measures so decisive and effectual for circum∣scribing the regulars within their proper sphere, as struck them with general consternation<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE LXXXVII.</NOTE>. They had recourse to their usual arts. They alarmed the superstitious, by representing the proceedings of the viceroy as innovations fatal to religion. They employed all the refinements of intrigue, in order to gain persons in power; and seconded by the powerful influence of the Jesuits, who claimed and enjoyed all the privileges which belonged to the Mendicant orders in America, they made a deep

impression on a bigotted prince, and a weak mi∣nistry. The ancient practice was tolerated. The abuses which it occasioned continued to increase, and the corruption of monks, exempt from the re∣straints of discipline, and the inspection of any su∣perior, became a disgrace to religion. At last, as the veneration of the Spaniards for the monastic orders began to abate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">June 23, 1757.</NOTE> and the power of the Jesuits was on the decline, Ferdinand VI. ventured to apply the only effectual remedy by issuing an edict, prohibiting regulars of every denomination from taking the charge of any parish with the cure of souls; and declaring, that on the demise of the present incumbents, none but secular priests, sub∣ject to the jurisdiction of their diocesans, shall be presented to vacant benefices<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cedula MS. penes me.</NOTE>. If this regulation is carried into execution with steadiness in any de∣gree proportional to the wisdom with which it is framed, a very considerable reformation may take place in the ecclesiastical state of Spanish America, and the secular clergy may gradually become a re∣spectable body of men. The deportment of many ecclesiastics, even at present, seems to be decent and exemplary, otherwise we can hardly suppose that they would be held in such high estimation, and possess such a wonderful ascendant over the minds of their countrymen throughout all the Spanish settlements.</P>

For this, various rea∣sons
<PB N="390" REF="034476_0896_0FFDDD5C1F6D0758"/>
may be assigned. The first missionaries, in their ardour to make proselytes, admitted the peo∣ple of America into the christian church, without previous instruction in the doctrines of religion, and even before they themselves had acquired such knowledge of the Indian language, as to be able to explain to the natives the mysteries of faith, or the precepts of duty. Resting upon a subtle distinction in scholastic theology, between that degree of assent which is founded on a complete knowledge and conviction of duty, and that which may be yielded when both these are imperfect, they adopted this strange practice, no less inconsistent with the spirit of a religion which addresses itself to the under∣standing of men, than repugnant to the dictates of reason. As soon as any body of people over∣awed by dread of the Spanish power, moved by the example of their own chiefs, incited by levity, or yielding from mere ignorance, expressed the slightest desire of embracing the religion of their conquerors, they were instantly baptized. While this rage of convers<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion continued, a single clergy-man, baptized in one day above five thousand Mexicans, and did not desist until he was so exhausted by fatigue, that he was unable to lift his hands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">P.

force, or mingled an attachment to its doctrines and rites with that slender knowledge of Christi∣anity which they had acquired. These sentiments the new converts transmitted to their posterity, into whose minds they have sunk so deep, that the Spa∣nish ecclesiastics, with all their industry, have not been able to eradicate them. The religious insti∣tutions of their ancestors are still remembered, and held in honour by many of the Indians, both in Mexico and Peru; and whenever they think themselves out of reach of inspection by the Spa∣niards, they assemble and celebrate their idolatrous rites<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Voy. de Ulloa, i. 341.

<P>BUT this is not the most unsurmountable obstacle to the progress of Christianity among the Indians. The powers of their uncultivated understandings are so limited, their observations and reflections reach so little beyond the mere objects of sense, that they seem hardly to have the capacity of forming abstract ideas, and possess not language to express them. To such men, the sublime and spiritual doctrines of Christianity must be, in a great measure, incom∣prehensible. The numerous and splendid cere∣monies of the popish worship catch the eye, please and interest them; but when their instructors at∣tempt to explain the articles of faith, with which those external observances are connected, though the Indians may listen with patience, they so little conceive the meaning of what they hear, that their acquiescence does not merit the name of belief. Their indifference is still greater than their incapa∣city. Attentive only to the present moment, and ingrossed by the objects before them, the Indians so seldom reflect upon what is past, or take thought

for what is to come, that neither the promises nor threats of religion, make much impression upon them; and while their foresight rarely extends so far as the next day, it is almost impossible to in∣spire them with solicitude about the concerns of a future world. Astonished equally at their slowness of comprehension, and at their insensibility, some of the early missionaries pronounced them a race of men so brutish, as to be incapable of understanding the first principles of religion. A council held at Lima decreed, that, on account of this incapacity, they ought to be excluded from the sacrament of the Eucharist<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Torquem. lib. xvi. c. 20.</NOTE>. Though Paul III. by his famous bull, issued in the year 1537, declared them to be rational creatures, entitled to all the privileges of Christians<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Torquem lib. xvi. c. 25.

Even after the most perfect in∣struction, their faith is held to be feeble and du∣bious; and though some of them have been taught the learned languages, and have gone through the ordinary course of academic education with ap∣plause, their frailty is still so much suspected, that

<P>FROM this brief survey,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Producti∣ons of the Spanish co∣lonies.</NOTE> some idea may be formed of the interior state of the Spanish colonies. The various productions with which they supply and enrich the mother-country, and the system of com∣mercial intercourse between them, come next in order to be explained. If the dominions of Spain in the New World had been of such moderate ex∣tent, as bore a due proportion to the parent state, the progress of her colonizing might have been attended with the same benefit as that of other na∣tions. But when, in less than half a century, her inconsiderate rapacity had seized on countries larger than all Europe, her inability to fill such vast re∣gions with a number of inhabitants sufficient for the cultivation of them, was so obvious, as to give a wrong direction to all the efforts of the colonists. They did not form compact settlements, where in∣dustry, circumscribed within proper limits, both in its views and operations, is conducted with that sober persevering spirit, which gradually converts what∣ever is in its possession to a proper use, and derives thence the greatest advantage. Instead of this, the Spaniards, seduced by the boundless prospect which opened to them, divided their possessions in Ame∣rica into governments of great extent. As their number was too small to attempt the regular culture of the immense provinces, which they occupied rather than peopled, they bent their attention to a few objects, that allured them with hopes of sudden and exorbitant gain, and turned away with con∣tempt from the humbler paths of industry, which lead more slowly, but with greater certainty, to wealth and increase of national strength.</P>

Accordingly, as soon as the several countries in America were subjected to the dominion of Spain, this was almost the only method of acquiring wealth which occur∣red to the adventurers, by whom they were con∣quered. Such provinces of the continent as did not allure them to settle, by the prospect of their affording gold and silver, were totally neglected. Those in which they met with a disappointment of the sanguine expectations they had formed, were abandoned. Even the value of the islands, the first-fruits of their discoveries, and the first object of their attention, sunk so much in their estimation, when the mines which had been opened in them were exhausted, that they were deserted by many of the planters, and left to be occupied by more in∣dustrious possessors. All crowded to Mexico and Peru, where the quantities of gold and silver found among the natives, who searched for them with little industry and less skill, promised an unex∣hausted store, as the recompence of more intelli∣gent and persevering efforts.</P>

From that time, successive discoveries have been made in both colonies, and silver mines are now so numerous, that the working of them, and of some few mines of gold in the province of Tierra Firmè, and the new kingdom of Granada, has become the capital occupation of the Spaniards, and is reduced into a system no less complicated than interesting. To describe the nature of the various ores, the mode of extracting them from the bowels of the earth, and to explain the several processes by which the metals are separated from the substances with which they are mingled, either by the action of fire, or the attractive powers, of mercury, is the province of the natural philosopher or chymist, rather than of the historian.</P>

Ac∣cording to principles of computation, which appear to be extremely moderate, the quantity of gold and silver that has been regularly entered in the ports of Spain, is equal in value to four millions sterling annually, reckoning from the year 1492, in which America was discovered, to the present time. This, in two hundred and eighty three years, amounts to eleven hundred and thirty-two millions. Immense as this sum is, the Spanish writers con∣tend, that as much more ought to be added to it, in consideration of treasure which has been extracted from the mines, and imported fraudulently into Spain, without paying duty to the king. By this account, Spain has drawn from the New World a

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Spirit to which this gives rise.</NOTE>THE mines, which have yielded this amazing quantity of treasure, are not worked at the expence of the crown, or of the public. In order to en∣courage private adventurers, the person who dis∣covers and works a new vein, is entitled to the property of it. Upon laying his claim to such a discovery before the governor of the province, a certain extent of land is measured off, and a certain number of Indians allotted him, under the obliga∣tion of his opening the mine within a limited time, and of his paying the customary duty to the king, for what it shall produce. Invited by the facility with which such grants are obtained, and encou∣raged by some striking examples of success in this line of adventure; not only the sanguine and the bold, but the timid and diffident enter upon it with astonishing ardour. With vast objects always in view, fed continually with hope, and expecting every moment that fortune will unveil her secret stores, and give up the wealth which they contain to their wishes, they deem every other occupation insipid and uninteresting.

For it is observed, that if any person once enter this seducing path, it is almost impossible to return; his ideas alter, he seems to be possessed with another spirit, visions of imaginary wealth are continually before his eyes, and he thinks, and speaks, and dreams of nothing else<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ulloa Entreten. p. 223.</NOTE>.</P>

No spirit is more adverse to such improvement in agri∣culture and commerce, as render a nation really opulent. If the system of administration in the Spanish colonies had been founded upon principles of sound policy, the power and ingenuity of the legislature would have been exerted with as much ardour, in restraining its subjects from such perni∣cious industry, as is now employed in alluring them towards it. "Projects of mining" (says a good judge of the political conduct of nations), <Q>instead of replacing the capital employed in them, together with the ordinary profit of stock,

Such, in reality, is the absurd confidence which all men have in their own good fortune, that wherever there is the least probability of success, too great a share of it is apt to go to them of its own ac∣cord†.</Q> But in the Spanish colonies, govern∣ment is studious to cherish a spirit which it should have laboured to depress, and, by the sanction of its approbation, augments that inconsiderate cre∣dulity, which has turned the active industry of Mexico and Peru into such an improper channel. To this may be imputed the slender progress which Spanish America has made during two centuries and a half, either in useful manufactures, or in those lucrative branches of cultivation, which furnish the colonies of other nations with their staple commo∣dities. In comparison with the precious metals every bounty of nature is so much despised, that this extravagant idea of their value has mingled with the idiom of language in America, and the Spaniards settled there denominate a country, <HI>rich,</HI> not from the fertility of its soil, the abundance of its crops, or the exuberance of its pastures, but on account of the minerals which its mountains con∣tain.

Spaniards originally took this direction, it is now so difficult to bend them a different way, that al∣though, from various causes, the gain of working mines is much decreased; the fascination continues, and almost every person, who takes any active part in the commerce of New Spain or Peru, is still en∣gaged in some adventure of this kind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XC.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT though mines are the chief object of the Spaniards,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Other com∣modities of the Spanish colonies.</NOTE> and the precious metals which these yield, form the principal article in their commerce with America; the fertile countries which they possess there, abound with other commodities of such value or scarcity, as to attract a considerable degree of attention. Cochineal is a production al∣most peculiar to New Spain, of such demand in commerce, that the sale is always certain, and it yields such profit, as amply rewards the labour and care employed in rearing the curious insects of which this valuable drug is composed, and prepar∣ing it for the market. Quinqina, or Jesuits Bark, the most salutary simple, perhaps, and of most restorative virtue, that Providence, in compassion to human infirmity, has made known unto man, is found only in Peru, to which it affords a lucrative branch of commerce. The Indigo of Guatimala is superior in quality to that of any province in Ame∣rica, and cultivated to a considerable extent. Ca∣coa, though nor peculiar to the Spanish colonies, attains to its highest state of perfection there, and from the great consumption of chocolate in Eu∣rope, as well as in America, is a valuable commo∣dity. The Tobacco of Cuba, of more exquisite flavour than any brought from the New World; the Sugar raised in that island, in Hispaniola, and in New Spain, together with drugs of various kinds, may be mentioned among the natural pro∣ductions

of America, which enrich the Spanish commerce. To these must be added, an article of no inconsiderable account, the exportation of hides; for which, as well as for many of those which I have enumerated, the Spaniards are more indebted to the wonderful fertility of the country than to their own foresight and industry. The domestic animals of Europe, particularly horned cattle, have multiplied in the New World with a rapidity which almost exceeds belief. A few years after the Spaniards settled there, the herds of tame cattle became so numerous that their proprietors reckoned them by thousands<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oviedo ap Ramus iii. 101, B. Hackluyt, iii. 466, 511.</NOTE>. Less attention being paid to them, as they continued to increase, they were suffered to run wild, and spreading over a country of boundless extent, under a mild cli∣mate, and covered with rich pasture, their num∣ber became immense. They range over the vast plains which extend from Buenos Ayres, towards the Andes, in herds of thirty or forty thousand; and the unlucky traveller who once falls in among them, may proceed several days before he can dis∣entangle himself from among the crowd that covers the face of the earth, and seems to have no end. They are hardly less numerous in New Spain, and in several other provinces: they are killed merely for the sake of their hides; and the slaughter at certain seasons is so great, that the stench of their carcases, which are left in the field, would insect the air, if large packs of wild dogs, and vast flocks of <HI>gallinazos,</HI> or American vultures, the most voracious of all the feathered kind, did not instantly devour them. The number of those hides exported in every fleet to Europe is

<P>ALMOST all these may be considered as staple commodities peculiar to America, and different, if we except that last mentioned, from the produc∣tions of the mother-country.</P>
<P>WHEN the importation into Spain of those va∣rious articles from her colonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Advanta∣ges which Spain de∣rives from her colo∣nies.</NOTE> first became active and considerable, her interior industry and manu∣factures were in a state so prosperous, that with the product of these she was able both to purchase the commodities of the New World, and to an∣swer its growing demands. Under the reigns of Ferdinand and Isabella, and Charles V. Spain was one of the most industrious countries in Europe. Her manufactures in wool, and flax, and silk, were so extensive, as not only to furnish what was suffi∣cient for her own consumption, but to afford a sur∣plus for exportation. When a market for them, formerly unknown, and to which she alone had access, opened in America, she had recourse to her domestic store, and found there an abundant sup∣ply<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XCI.</NOTE>. This new employment must naturally have added vivacity to the spirit of industry. Nourished and invigorated by it, the manufactures, the popu∣lation, and wealth of Spain might have gone on in∣creasing in the same proportion with the growth of her colonies. Nor was the state of the Spanish marine at this period less flourishing than that of its manufactures. In the beginning of the sixteenth century, Spain is said to have possessed above a thousand merchant ships<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Campomanes, ii. 140.</NOTE>, a number probably far superior to that of any nation in Europe in that
<PB N="402" REF="034476_0908_0FFDC55D50203C20"/>
age. By the aid which foreign trade and domestic industry give reciprocally to each other in their progress, the augmentation of both must have been rapid and entensive, and Spain might have received the same accession of opulence and vigour from her acquisitions in the New World, that other powers have derived from their colonies there.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Why she does not now derive the same.</NOTE>BUT various causes prevented this. The same thing happens to nations as to individuals. Wealth, which flows in gradually, and with moderate in∣crease, feeds and nourishes that activity which is friendly to commerce, and calls it forth into vigor∣ous and well-conducted exertions; but when opu∣lence pours in suddenly, and with too full a stream, it overturns all sober plans of industry, and brings along with it a taste for what is wild and extrava∣gant, and daring in business or in action. Such was the great and sudden augmentation of power and revenue, that the possession of America brought into Spain, and some symptoms of its pernicious influence upon the political operations of that mo∣narchy soon began to appear. For a considerable time, however, the supply of treasure from the New World was scanty and precarious, and the genius of Charles V. conducted public measures with such prudence, that the effects of this influence were little perceived. But when Philip II. ascended the Spanish throne, with talents far inferior to those of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> her, and remittances from the colonies be∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me a regular and considerable branch of revenue, the fatal operation of this rapid change in the state of the kingdom, both on the monarch and his people, was at once conspicuous. Philip, pos∣sessing that spirit of unceasing affiduity, which often characterises the ambition of men of moderate ta∣lents, entertained such an high opinion of his own resources, that he thought nothing too arduous for
<PB N="403" REF="034476_0909_0FFDDD776C771268"/>
him to undertake. Shut up himself in the solitude of the Escuriel, he troubled and annoyed all the nations around him. He waged open war with the Dutch and English; he encouraged and aided a rebellious faction in France; he conquered Portugal, and maintained armies and garrisons in Italy, Africa, and both the Indies. By such a multiplicity of great and complicated operations, pursued with ar∣dour during the course of a long reign, Spain was drained both of men and money. Under the weak administration of his successor, Philip III. the vi∣gour of the nation continued to decreas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and sunk into the lowest decline,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

Her flourish¦ing manufactures were fallen into decay. Her fleets, which had been the terror of all Europe, were ruined. Her extensive foreign commerce was lost. The trade between different parts of her own dominions was interrupted, and the ships which at∣tempted to carry it on, were taken and plundered by enemies whom she once despised. Even agri∣culture, the primary object of industry in every prosperous state, was neglected, and one of the most fertile countries in Europe hardly raised what was sufficient for the support of its own inhabit∣ants.</P>

like their monarchs, intoxicated with the wealth which poured in annually upon them, deserted the paths of industry, to which they had been accus∣tomed, and repaired with eagerness to those regions from which this opulence issued. By this rage of emigration<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> another drain was opened, and the strength of the colonies augmented by exhausting that of the mother-country. All those emigrants, as well as the adventurers who had at first settled in America, depended absolutely upon Spain for almost every article of necessary consumption. En∣gaged in more alluring and lucrative pursuits, or prevented by restraints which government imposed, they could not turn their own attention towards establishing the manufactures requisite for comfort∣able subsist<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nce. They received (as I have observed in another place) their cloathing, their furniture, whatever ministers to the ease or luxury of life, and even their instruments of labour, from Europe. Spain, thinned of people, and decreasing in indus∣try, was unable to supply their growing demands. She had recourse to her neighbours. The manu∣factures of the Low Countries, of England, of France, and of Italy, which her wants called into existence, or animated with new vivacity, furnished in abundance whatever she required. In vain did the fundamental law, concerning the exclusion of foreigners from trade with America, oppose this innovation. Necessity more powerful than any statute, defeated its operations, and constrained the Spaniards themselves to concur in eluding it. The English, the French, and Dutch, relying on the fidelity and honour of Spanish merchants, who lend their names to cover the deceit, send out their manufactures to America, and receive the exorbitant price for which they are sold there, either in specie, or in the rich commodities of the New

World. Neither the dread of danger, nor the al∣lurement of profit, ever induced a Spanish factor to betray or defraud the person who confided in him <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Zavala Representacion, p 226.</NOTE>. and that probity, which is the pride and distinction of the nation, contributes to its ruin. In a short time, not above a twentieth part of the commodities exported to America was of Spanish growth or fabric<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Campomanes, ii. 138.</NOTE>. All the rest was the property of foreign merchants, though entered in the name of Spaniards. The treasure of the New World may be said henceforward not to have belonged to Spain. Before it reached Europe, it was antici∣pated as the price of goods purchased from fo∣reigners. That wealth which, by an internal cir∣culation, would have spread through each vein of industry, and have conveyed life and movement to every branch of manufacture, flowed out of the kingdom with such a rapid course, as neither en∣riched nor animated it. On the other hand, the artizans of rival nations, encouraged by this quick sale of their commodities, improved so much in skill and industry, as to be able to afford them at a rate so low, that the manufactures of Spain, which could not vie with theirs, either in quality or cheapness of work, were still farther depressed. This destructive commerce drained off the riches of the nation faster and more completely, than even the extravagant schemes of ambition carried on by its monarchs. Spain was so much astonished and distressed, at beholding her American treasures vanish almost as soon as they were imported, that Philip III. unable to supply what was requisite in circulation, issued an edict, by which he endea∣voured to raise copper money to a value in cur∣rency

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Increased by the mode of regulating its inter∣course with America.</NOTE>SUCH has been the internal state of Spain from the close of the sixteenth century, and such her in∣ability to supply the growing wants of her colo∣nies. The fatal effects of this disproportion be∣tween their demands and her capacity of answer∣ing them, have been much increased by the mode in which Spain has endeavoured to regulate the in∣tercourse between the mother-country and the co∣lonies. It is from her idea of monopolizing the trade with America, and debarring her subjects there from any communication with foreigners, that all her jealous and systematic arrangements have arisen. These are so singular in their nature and consequences as to merit a particular explanation. In order to secure the monopoly at which she aimed, Spain did not vest the trade with her colonies in an exclusive company, a plan which has been adopted by nations more commercial, and at a period when
<PB N="407" REF="034476_0913_0FFDDD8265E362F8"/>
mercantile policy was an object of greater atten∣tion, and ought to have been better understood. The Dutch gave up the whole trade with their colonies, both in the East and West Indies, to exclusive companies. The English, the French, the Danes, have imitated their example with respect to the East Indian commerce; and the two former have laid a similar restraint upon some branches of their trade with the New World. The wit of man cannot, perhaps, devise a method for checking the progress of industry and population in a new colony more effectual than this. The interest of the co∣lony, and of the exclusive company, must in every point be diametrically opposite; and as the latter possesses such advantages in this unequal contest, that it can prescribe, at pleasure the terms of inter∣course, the former must not only buy dear and sell cheap, but must suffer the mortification of having the increase of its surplus stock discouraged by those very persons to whom alone it can dispose of its productions<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Smith's Inquiry, ii. 171.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SPAIN, it is probable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">This con∣fined to one part in Spain.</NOTE> was preserved from fall∣ing into this error in policy, by the high ideas which she early formed concerning the riches of the New World. Gold and silver were commo∣dities of too high value to vest a monopoly of them in private hands. The crown wished to retain the direction of a commerce so inviting; and, in order to secure that, ordained the cargo of every ship fitted out for America, to be inspected by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs of the <HI>C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sa de Contra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acion</HI> in Seville, be∣f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re it could receive a licence to make the voyage; and that on its return, a report of the commodities which it brought should be made to the same board, before it could be permitted to land them.

of this regulation, all the trade of Spain, with the New World centered originally in the port of Seville, and was gradually brought into a form, in which it has been conducted, with little varia∣tion, from the middle of the sixteenth century al∣most to our own times. For the greater security of the valuable cargoes sent to America, as well as for the more easy prevention of fraud, the commerce of Spain, with its colonies, is carried on by fleets which sail under strong convoys. These fleets con∣sisting of two squadrons, one distinguished by the name of the <HI>Galeons,</HI> the other by that of the <HI>Flota,</HI> are equipped annually. Formerly they took their departure from Seville; but as the port of Cadiz has been found more commodious, they have sailed from it since the year 1720.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Carried on by the Ga∣leons,</NOTE>THE Galeons destined to supply Tierra Firmé, and the kingdoms of Peru and Chili, with almost every article of luxury, or necessary consumption, that an opulent people can demand, touch first at Carthagena, and then at Porto-bello.

At the season when the Galeons are expected, the product of all the mines in these two kingdoms, together with their other valuable commodities, is transported by sea to Panama. From thence, as soon as the ap∣pearance of the fleet from Europe is announced, they are conveyed across the isthmus, partly on mules, and partly down the river Chagre to Porto-bello.

<P>THE trade of Spain with her colonies,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bad effects of this ar∣rangement.</NOTE> while thus fettered and restricted, came necessarily to be conducted with the same spirit, and upon the same principles, as that of an exclusive company. Be∣ing confined to a single port, it was of course thrown into a few hands, and almost the whole of it was gradually engrossed by a small number of wealthy houses, formerly in Seville, and now in Cadiz. These by combinations, which they can easily form, may altogether prevent that competi∣tion which preserves commodities at their natural price; and by acting in concert, to which they are prompted by their mutual interest, they may raise or lower the value of them at pleasure.

of this, the price of European goods in America, is always high, and often exorbitant.

From the same engrossing spirit it frequently happens, that traders of the second order, whose warehouses do not contain a complete assortment of commodities for the American market, cannot purchase from the more opulent merchants such goods as they want, at a lower price than that for which they are sold in the colonies. With the same vigilant jealousy that an exclusive company guards against the intrusion of the free trader, those overgrown monopolists endeavour to check the progress of every one whose encroachments they dread<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Smith's Inquiry, ii. 171. Campomanes, Educ. Pop<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l. i. 438.</NOTE>. This restraint of the American commerce to one port not only affects its domestic state, but limits its foreign operations. A monopolist may acquire more, and certainly will hazard less, by a confined trade which yields exorbitant profit, than by an extensive commerce in which he receives only a moderate return of gain. It is often his interest not to enlarge, but to circumscribe the sphere of his activity; and, instead of calling forth more vigorous exertions of commercial industry, it may be the object of his attention to check and set bounds to them. By some such maxim, the mer∣cantile policy of Spain seems to have regulated its intercourse with America. Instead of furnishing the colonies with European goods in such quantity as might render both the price and the profit mo∣derate; the merchants of Seville and Cadiz seem to have supplied them with a sparing hand, that

About the middle of the last century, when the exclusive trade to America from Seville was in its most flourishing state, the burden of the two united squadrons of the Galeons and Flota, did not exceed twenty-seven thousand five hundred tons<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Campomanes, Educ.

<P>BESIDES these wild projects, many schemes, bet∣ter digested and more beneficial, were suggested. But under the feeble monarchs, with whom the reign of the Austrian line in Spain closed, inca∣pacity and indecision are conspicuous in every de∣partment of government. Instead of taking for their model the active administration of Charles V. they affected to imitate the cautious procrastinating wisdom of Philip II. and destitute of his talents, they deliberated perpetually, but determined no∣thing. No remedy was applied to the evils under which the national commerce, domestic as well as foreign, languished. These evils continued to in∣crease, and Spain, with dominions more extensive and more opulent than any European state, pos∣sessed neither vigour, nor money<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XCIII.</NOTE>, nor industry. At length, the violence of a great national con∣vulsion roused the slumbering genius of Spain. The efforts of the two contending parties in the civil war, kindled by the dispute concerning the succession of the crown at the beginning of this century, called forth, in some degree, the ancient spirit and vigour of the nation. While men were thus forming, capable of adopting sentiments more liberal than those which had influenced the councils of the monarchy during the course of a century, Spain derived from an unexpected source the means of availing itself of their talents. The various powers who favoured the petensions either of the

Austrian or Bourbon candidate for the Spanish throne, sent formidable fleets and armies to their support; France, England, and Holland remitted immense sums to Spain. These were spent in the provinces which became the theatre of war. Part of the American treasure, of which foreigners had drained the kingdom, flowed back thither. From this aera, one of the most intelligent Spanish au∣thors dates the revival of the monarchy; and, how∣ever humiliating the truth may be, he acknow∣ledges, that it is to her enemies his country is in∣debted for the acquisition of a fund of circulating specie, in some measure adequate to the exigencies of the public<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Campomanes, i. 420.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AS soon as the Bourbons obtained quiet posses∣sion of the throne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Step to∣wards im∣provement by the Bourbon monarchs,</NOTE> they discerned this change in the spirit of the people, and in the state of the na∣tion, and took advantage of it; for although that family has not given monarchs to Spain remark∣able for superiority of genius, they have all been beneficent princes, attentive to the happiness of their subjects, and solicitous to promote it. It was, accordingly, the first object of Philip V. to suppress an innovation which had crept in during the course of the war, and had overturned the whole system of the Spanish commerce with Ame∣rica.

The merchants of

St. Malo, to whom Louis XIV. granted the pri∣vilege of this lucrative commerce, engaged in it with vigour, and carried it on upon principles very different from those of the Spaniards. They sup∣plied Peru with European commodities at a mode∣rate price, and not in stinted quantity. The goods which they imported were conveyed to every pro∣vince of Spanish America, in such abundance as had never been known in any former period. If this intercourse had been continued, the exportation of European commodities from Spain must have ceased, and the dependence of the colonies on the mother-country have been at an end.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1713.</NOTE> The most peremptory injunctions were therefore issued, pro∣hibiting the admission of foreign vessels into any port of Peru or Chili<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Frezier Voy. 256.

In consequence, of this, British factories were esta∣blished at Carthagena, Panama, Vera Cruz, Bue∣nos Ayres, and other Spanish settlements. The
<PB N="415" REF="034476_0921_0FFDDD98CFCC24C8"/>
veil with which Spain had hitherto covered the state and transactions of her colonies was removed. The agents of a rival nation, residing in the towns of most extensive trade, and of chief resort, had the best opportunities of becoming acquainted with the interior condition of the American provinces, of observing their stated and occasional wants, and of knowing what commodities might be imported into them with the greatest advantage. In conse∣quence of information so authentic and expedi∣tious, the merchants of Jamaica and other Eng∣lish colonies who traded to the Spanish main, were enabled to assort and proportion their cargoes so exactly to the demands of the market, that the contraband commerce was carried on with a faci∣lity, and to an extent unknown in any former pe∣riod. This however was not the most fatal conse∣quence of the assiento to the trade of Spain. The agents of the British South-Sea Company, under cover of the importation which they were autho∣rised to make by the ship sent annually to Porto∣bello, poured in their commodities on the Spanish continent, without limitation or restraint. Instead of a ship of five hundred tons, as stipulated in the treaty, they usually employed one which exceeded nine hundred tons in burden. She was accom∣panied by two or three smaller vessels, which, mooring in some neighbouring creek, supplied her clande<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tinely with fresh bales of goods, to replace such as were sold. The inspectors of the fair, and officers of the revenue, gained by exorbitant pre∣sents, connived at the fraud<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XCIV.</NOTE>. Thus, partly by the operations of the company, and partly by the activity of private interlopers, almost the whole trade of Spanish America was engrossed by fo∣reigners. The immense commerce of the Ga∣leons,

Her first expedient was to station ships of force under the appellation of <HI>Guarda Costas,</HI> upon the coasts of those provinces, to which interlopers most frequently resorted. As private interest con∣curred with the duty which they owed to the pub∣lic, in rendering the officers who commanded those vessels vigilant and active, some check was given to the progress of the contraband trade, though in dominions so extensive, and so accessible by sea, hardly any number of cruisers was sufficient to guard against its inroads in every quarter. This interrup∣tion of an intercourse, which had been carried on with so much facility, that the merchants in the British colonies were accustomed to consider it al∣most as an allowed branch of Commerce, excited murmurs and complaints. These authorised, in some measure, and rendered more interesting, by several unjustifiable acts of violence committed by the captains of the Spanish Guarda Costas, pre∣cipitated Great Britain into a war with Spain;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1739.</NOTE> in consequence of which the latter obtained a final release from the Assiento, and was left at liberty to regulate the commerce of her colonies, with∣out being restrained by any engagement with a fo∣reign power.</P>

Spaniards the vast consumption of European goods in their colonies, and taught them the advantage of accommodating their importations to the occa∣sional demand of the various provinces, they per∣ceived the necessity of devising some method of supplying their colonies, different from their an∣cient one, of sending thither periodical fleets. That mode of communication had been found not only to be uncertain, as the departure of the Ga∣leons and Flota was sometimes retarded by various accidents, and often prevented by the wars which raged in Europe; but long experience had shewn it to be ill adapted to afford America a regular and timely supply of what it wanted. The scar∣city of European goods in the Spanish settlements frequently became excessive; their price rose to an enormous height; the vigilant eye of mercantile attention did not fail to observe this favourable opportunity, an ample supply was poured in by interlopers from the English, the French, and Dutch islands; and when the Galeons at length arrived, they found the markets so glutted by this illicit commerce, that there was no demand for the commodities with which they were loaded. In order to remedy this, Spain has permitted a con∣siderable part of her commerce with America, to be carried on by <HI>register ships.</HI> These are fitted out, during the intervals between the stated sea∣sons when the Galeons and Flota sail, by merchants in Seville or Cadiz, upon obtaining a licence from the council of the Indies, for which they pay a very high premium, and are destined for those ports in America where any extraordinary demand is foreseen or expected. By this expedient, such a regular supply of the commodities, for which there is the greatest demand, is conveyed to the A∣merican market, that the interloper is no longer al∣lured
<PB N="418" REF="034476_0924_0FFDDD9CFAB40BB0"/>

<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Gale∣ons abo∣lished.</NOTE>IN proportion as experience manifested the ad∣vantages of carrying on trade in this mode, the number of register ships increased; and at length, in the year 1748, the Galeons after having been employed upwards of two centuries, were finally laid aside. From that period there has been no intercourse with Chili and Peru but by single ships, dispatched from time to time as occasion requires, and when the merchants expect a profitable market will open. These ships sail round Cape Horn, and convey directly to the ports in the South Sea the productions and manufactures of Europe, for which the people settled in those countries were formerly obliged to repair to Porto-bello or Panama. These towns, as has been formerly observed, must gradu∣ally decline, when deprived of that commerce to which they owed their prosperity. This disadvan∣tage however is more than compensated by the bene∣ficial effects of this new arrangement, as the whole continent of South America receives new supplies of European commodities, with so much regularity, and in such abundance, as must not only contri∣bute greatly to the happiness, but increase the po∣pulation of all the colonies settled there. But as all the register ships destined for the South Seas, must still take their departure from Cadiz, and are obliged to return thither<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Campomanes, i. 434.440.</NOTE>, this branch of the Ame∣rican commerce, even in its new and improved form, continues subject to the restraints of a species of monopoly, and feels those pernicious effects of it, which I have already described.</P>

Among the new tastes which the people of Europe have acquired in consequence of importing the productions of those countries which they conquered in America, that for chocolate is one of the most universal. The use of this liquor made with a paste, formed of the nut, or almond of the cacao-tree, compounded with various ingredi∣ents, the Spaniards first learned from the Mexicans; and it has appeared to them, and to the other Euro∣pean nations, so palatable, so nourishing, and so wholesome, that it has become a commercial article of considerable importance. The cacao-tree grows spontaneously in several parts of the torrid zone; but the nuts of the best quality, next to those of Guatimala, and the South Sea, are produced in the rich plains of Caraccas, a province of Tierra Firme. In consequence of this acknowledged superiority in the quality of cacao in that province, and its com∣munication with the Atlantic, which facilitates the conveyance to Europe, the culture of the cacao there is more extensive than in any district of Ame∣rica. But the Dutch, by the vicinity of their set∣tlements in the small islands of Curazoa and Buen-Ayre, to the coast of Caraccas, gradually ingrossed the greatest part of the cacao trade. The traffic with the mother-country for this valuable commo∣dity ceased almost entirely; and such was the su∣pine negligence of the Spaniards, or the defects of their commercial arrangements, that they were ob∣liged to receive from the hands of foreigners this production of their own colonies, at an exorbitant price. In order to remedy an evil no less disgrace∣ful,<NOTE PLACE="marg">by esta∣blishing the company of Caraccas.</NOTE> than pernicious to his subjects, Philip V. in the
<PB N="420" REF="034476_0926_0FFDDDA354179DA0"/>
year 1728, granted to a body of merchants, an exclusive right to the commerce with Garaccas and Cumana, on condition of their employing at their own expence, a sufficient number of armed vessels to clear the coast of interlopers. This so∣ciety, distinguished sometimes by the name of the Company of Guipuscoa, from the province of Spain in which it is established, and sometimes by that of the Company of Caraccas, from the district of Ame∣rica to which it trades, has carried on its operations with such vigour and success, that Spain has reco∣vered an important branch of commerce, which she had suffered to be wrested from her, and is plenti∣fully supplied with an article of extensive consump∣tion at a moderate price. Not only the parent state, but the colony of Caraccas, has derived great advantages from this institution; for although, at the first aspect it may appear to be one of those monopolies, whose tendency is to check the spirit of industry instead of calling it forth to new exer∣tions, it has been prevented from operating in this manner by several salutary regulations, framed upon foresight of such bad effects, and of purpose to obviate them. The planters in the Carraccas are not left to depend entirely on the company, either for the importation of European commodities, or the sale of their own productions. The inhabit∣ants of the Canary islands have the privilege of sending thither annually a register ship of consider∣able burden; and from Vera Cruz in New Spain, a free trade is permitted in every port compre∣hended in the charter of the company. In conse∣quence of this, there is such a competition, that both with respect to what the colonies purchase, and what they sell, the price seems to be fixed at its natural and equitable rate. The company has not the power of raising the former, or of degra∣ding
<PB N="421" REF="034476_0927_0FFDDDA5ECBA93A8"/>
the latter at pleasure; and accordingly, since it was established, the increase of culture, of popu∣lation, and of live stock, in the province of Carac∣cas, has been very considerable<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XCV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT as it is slowly that nations relinquish any system which time has rendered venerable,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Enlarge∣ment of commercial ideas in Spain.</NOTE> and as it is still more slowly that commerce can be diverted from the channel in which it has long been accus∣stomed to flow; Philip V. in his new regulations concerning the American trade, paid such deference to the ancient maxim of Spain, concerning the li∣mitation of all importation from the New World to one harbour, as to oblige both the register ships which returned from Peru, and those of the Gui∣puscan Company from Caraccas, to deliver their cargoes in the port of Cadiz. Since his reign, sen∣timents more liberal and enlarged begin to spread in Spain. The spirit of philosophical inquiry, which it is the glory of the present age to have turned from frivolous or abstruse speculations, to the business and affairs of men, has extended its influence beyond the Pyrenees. In the researches of ingenious authors, concerning the police or commerce of nations, the errors and defects of the Spanish system with respect to both met every eye, and have not only been exposed with severity, but are held up as a warning to other states. The Spa∣niards, stung with the reproaches of these authors, or convinced by their arguments, and admonished by several enlightened writers of their own coun∣try, seem at length to have discovered the destruc∣tive tendency of those narrow maxims, which, by cramping commerce in all its operations, have so long retarded its progress. It is to the monarch now on the throne, that Spain is indebted for the first public regulation formed in consequence of such enlarged ideas.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="034476_0928_0FFDDDA88D233C48"/>WHILE Spain adhered with rigour to her an∣cient maxims concerning her commerce with America,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Establish∣ment of re∣gular pack∣et boats.</NOTE> she was so much afraid of opening any channel, by which an illicit trade might find ad∣mission into the colonies, that she almost shut her∣self out from any intercourse with them, but that which was carried on by her annual fleets. There was no establishment for a regular communication of either public or private intelligence, between the mother-country and its American settlements. From the want of this necessary institution, the operations of the state, as well as the business of individuals, were retarded or conducted unskil∣fully, and Spain often received from foreigners her first information with respect to very interesting events in her own colonies. But though this de∣fect in police was sensibly felt, and the remedy for it was obvious, that jealous spirit with which the Spanish monarchs guarded the exclusive trade, restrained them from applying it. At length Charles III. surmounted those considerations which had deterred his predecessors, and in the year 1764 appointed packet-boats to be dispatched on the first day of each month, from Corugna to the Havanna of Porto-Rico. From thence letters are conveyed in smaller vessels to Vera Cruz and Porto-bello, and transmitted by post through the kingdoms of Tierra Firme, Granada, Peru, and New Spain. With no less regularity packet-boats sail once in two months to Rio de la Plata, for the accommodation of the provinces to the east of the Andes. Thus provision is made for a speedy and certain circulation of intelligence throughout the vast dominions of Spain, from which equal advan∣tages must redound to the political and mercantile interest of the kingdom<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ponz Viage de Espagna, vi Prol. p. 15.</NOTE>.

<PB N="423" REF="034476_0929_0FFDDDAB6B500340"/>
a scheme of extending commerce has been more immediately connected. Each of the packet-boats, which are vessels of some considerable bur∣den, is allowed to take in half a loading of such commodities as are the product of Spain, and most in demand in the ports whither they are bound.

<P>IT was soon followed by one more decisive.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Free trade permitted to several provinces.</NOTE> In the year 1765, Charles III. laid open the trade to the windward islands, Cuba, Hispaniola, Porto. Rico, Margarita, and Trinidad, to his subjects in every province of Spain. He permitted them to sail from certain ports in each province, which are specified in the edict, at any season, and with what∣ever cargo they deemed most proper, without any other warrant than a simple clearance from the custom-house of the place whence they took their departure. He released them from the numerous and oppressive duties imposed on goods exported to America, and in place of the whole, substituted a moderate tax of six in the hundred on the com∣modities sent from Spain. He allowed them to return either to the same port, or to any other where they might hope for a more advantageous market, and there to enter the homeward cargo, on payment of the usual duties. This ample pri∣vilege, which at once broke through all the fences which the jealous policy of Spain had been labour∣ing, for two centuries and a half, to throw round

its commercial intercourse with the New World, was soon after extended to Louisiana, and to the provinces of Yucatan and Campeachy<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Append. ii a la Educ. Pop. 37.54.91.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Beneficial effects of it.</NOTE>THE propriety of this innovation, which may be considered as the most liberal effort of Spanish le∣gislation, has appeared from its effects. Prior to the edict in favour of the free trade, Spain derived hardly any benefit from its neglected colonies in Hispaniola, Porto-Rico, Margarita, and Trinidad. Its commerce with Cuba was inconsiderable, and that of Yucatan and Campeachy was ingrossed al∣most entirely by interlopers. But as soon as a ge∣neral liberty of trade was permitted, the inter∣course with those provinces revived, and has gone on with a rapidity of progression, of which there are few examples in the history of nations. In less than ten years, the trade of Cuba has been more than tripled. Even in those settlements where, from the languishing state of industry, greater ef∣forts were requisite to restore its activity, their commerce has been doubled. It is computed, that such a number of ships is already employed in the free trade, that the tonnage of them far exceeds that of the Galeons and Flota, at the most flourish∣ing aera of their commerce. The benefits of this arrangement are not confined to a few merchants, established in a favourite port. They are diffused through every province of the kingdom; and by opening a new market for their various produc∣tions and manufactures, must encourage and add vivacity to the industry of the farmer and artificer. Nor does the kingdom profit only by what it ex∣ports, it derives advantage likewise from what it receives in return, and has the prospect of being soon able to supply itself with several commodities
<PB N="425" REF="034476_0931_0FFDDDB103BC3128"/>
of extensive consumption, for which it formerly depended on foreigners. The consumption of sugar in Spain is perhaps as great in proportion to the number of its inhabitants, as that of any European kingdom. But though possessed of countries in the New World, whose soil and climate are most proper for rearing the sugar cane; though the domestic culture of that valuable plant in the king∣dom of Granada was once considerable; such has been the fatal tendency of ill judged institutions in America, and such the pressure of improper taxes in Europe, that Spain has lost almost entirely this branch of industry, which has enriched other na∣tions. This commodity, which has now become an article of primary necessity in Europe, the Spa∣niards were obliged to purchase of foreigners, and had the mortification to see their country drained annually of great sums on that account<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Uzt<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>riz, c. 94.</NOTE>. But if that spirit, which the permission of free trade has put in motion, shall persevere in its efforts with the same vigour, the cultivation of sugar in Cuba and Porto-Rico may increase so much, that in a few years, it is probable, that their growth of sugars may be equal to the demand of the king∣dom.</P>
<P>SPAIN has been induced,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Free trade permitted between the colonies.</NOTE> by her experience of the beneficial consequences resulting from having relaxed somewhat of the rigour of her ancient laws with respect to the commerce of the mother-coun∣try with the colonies, to permit a more liberal in∣tercourse of one colony with another. By one of the jealous maxims of the old system, all the pro∣vinces situated on the South Seas were prohibited, under the most severe penalties, from holding any communication with one another. Though each
<PB N="426" REF="034476_0932_0FFDDDB39ED065B0"/>
of these yield peculiar productions, the reciprocal exchange of which might have added to the happi∣ness of their respective inhabitants, or have facili∣tated their progress in industry, so solicitous was the council of the Indies to prevent their receiving any supply of their wants, but by the periodical fleets from Europe, that in order to guard against this, it cruelly debarred the Spaniards in Peru, in the southern provinces of New Spain, in Guatimala and the New Kingdom of Granada, from such a correspondence with their fellow-subjects, as tended manifestly to their mutual prosperity. Of all the numerous restrictions devised by Spain for securing the exclusive trade with her American settlements, none perhaps was more illiberal, none seems to have been more sensibly felt, or to have produced more hurtful effects. This grievance, coeval <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th the settlements of Spain in the countries situated on the Pacific Ocean, is at last redressed. In the year 1774, Charles III. published an edict, granting to the four great provinces which I have mentioned, the privilege of a free trade with each other<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Real Cedula penes me. Pontz Viage de Espagna, vi. Pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oga p. 2. NOTE XCVI.</NOTE>. What may be the effects of opening this communication between countries destined by their situation for reciprocal intercourse, cannot yet be determined by experience. They can hardly fail of being be∣neficial and extensive. The motives for granting this permission are manifestly no less laudable, than the principle on which it is founded is liberal; and both discover the progress of a spirit in Spain, far elevated above the narrow prejudices and maxims on which her system for regulating the trade, and conducting the government of her colonies, was originally founded.</P>
<P>AT the same time that Spain has been intent on
<PB N="427" REF="034476_0933_0FFDDDB67A358CE0"/>
introducing regulations, suggested by more enlarged views of policy, into her system of American commerce, she has not been inattentive to the interior government of her colonies.<NOTE PLACE="marg">New regu∣lation con∣cerning the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of the co∣lonies.</NOTE> Here too there was much room for reformation and im∣provement, and Don Joseph Galvez, who has now the direction of the department for Indian affairs in Spain, has enjoyed the best opportunities, not only of observing the defects and corruption in the political frame or the colonies, but of discovering the sources of those evils. After being employed seven years in the New World on an extraordinary mission, and with very extensive powers, as in∣spector-general of New Spain; after visiting in person the remote provinces of Cinaloa, Sonora, and California, and making several important al∣terations in the state of the police and revenue; he began his ministry with a general reformation of the tribunals of justice in America.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Reforma∣tion of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of justice.</NOTE> In conse∣quence of the progress of population and wealth in the colonies, the business of the Courts of Au∣dience has increased so much, that the number of judges of which they were originally composed, has been found inadequate to the growing labours and duties of the office, and the salaries settled upon them have been deemed inferior to the dignity of the station. As a remedy for both, he obtained a royal edict, establishing an additional number of judges in each court of audience, with higher titles, and more ample appointments <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gazers de Madrid, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th March 1776.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>TO the same intelligent minister Spain is in∣debted for a new distribution of government in its American provinces.<NOTE PLACE="marg">New distri∣bution of govern∣ment.</NOTE> Even since the establishment of a third viceroyalty in the New kingdom of Granada, so great is the extent of the Spanish do∣minions in the New World, that several places

subject to the jurisdiction of each viceroy, were at such an enormous distance from the capitals in which they resided, that neither their attention, nor their authority, could reach so far. Some pro∣vinces subordinate to the viceroy of New Spain, lay above two thousand miles from Mexico. There were countries subject to the viceroy of Peru still farther from Lima. The people in those remote districts could hardly be said to enjoy the benefit of civil government. The oppression and insolence of its inferior ministers they often feel, and rather submit to these in silence, than involve themselves in the expence and trouble of resorting to the dis∣tant capitals, where alone they can find redress. As a remedy for this,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New vice∣royalty. Aug. 1776, on Rio de la Plata.</NOTE> a fourth viceroyalty has been erected, to the jurisdiction of which are subjected the provinces of Rio de la Plata, Buenos-Ayres, Paraguay, Tucuman, Potosi, St<SUP>a</SUP> Cruz de la Sierra, Charcas, and the towns of Mendoza and St. Juan. By this well-judged arrangement, two advantages are gained. All the inconveniencies occasioned by the remote situation of those provinces, which had been long felt, and long complained of, are in a great measure, removed. The countries most distant from Lima are separated from the viceroy∣alty of Peru, and united under a superior, whose seat of government at Buenos-Ayres, will be com∣modious and accessible. The contraband trade with the Portuguese, which was become so exten∣sive, as must have put a final stop to the exportation of commodities from Spain to her southern colonies, may be checked more thoroughly, and with greater facility, when the supreme magistrate, by his vi∣cinity to the places in which it is carried on, can view its progress and effects with his own eyes. Don Pedro Zevallos, who has been raised to this new dignity, with appointments equal to those of
<PB N="429" REF="034476_0935_0FFDDDBACB98A0C0"/>
the other viceroys, is well acquainted both with the state and the interest of the countries over which he is to preside, having served in them long, and with distinction. By this dismemberment, succeeding that which took place at the erection of the viceroyalty of the New Kingdom of Granada, almost two-third parts of the territories, originally subject to the viceroys of Peru, are now lopped off from their jurisdiction.</P>
<P>THE limits of the viceroyalty of New Spain have likewise been <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>derably circumscribed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New go∣ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nora, &amp;c.</NOTE> and with no less propriety and discernment. Four of its most remote provinces. Sonora, Cinaloa, Califor∣nia, and New Navarro, have been formed into a separate government. The Chevalier de Croix, who is intrusted with this command, is not dignified with the title of viceroy, nor does he enjoy the appoint∣ments belonging to that rank, but his jurisdiction is altogether independent on the viceroyalty of New Spain. The erection of this last government seems to have been suggested, not only by the considera∣tion of the remote situation of those provinces from Mexico, but by attention to the late discoveries made there, which I have mentioned<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Book vii p. 229.</NOTE>. Countries con∣taining the richest mines of gold that have hitherto been discovered in the New World, and which pro∣bably may arise into great importance, required the immediate inspection of a governor, to whom they should be specially committed. As every consider∣ation of duty, of interest, and of vanity, must concur in prompting those new governors to encourage such exertions as tend to diffuse opulence and pro∣sperity through the provinces committed to their charge, the beneficial effects of this arrangement may be considerable. Many districts in America, long depressed by the languor and feebleness natural to provinces which compose the extremities of an over∣grown

empire, may be animated with vigour and activity, when brought so near the seat of power as to feel its invigorating influence.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempts to reform domestic policy.</NOTE>SUCH, since the accession of the princes of the House of Bourbon, to the throne of Spain, has been the progress of their regulations, and the gradual expansion of their views with respect to the com∣merce and government of their American colonies. Nor has their attention been so entirely engrossed by what related to the more remote parts of their dominions, as to render them neglectful of what was still more important, the reformation of domestic errors and defects in policy. Fully sensible of the causes to which the declension of Spain, from her former prosperity, ought to be imputed, they have made it a great object of their policy, to revive a spirit of industry among their subjects, and to give such extent and perfection to their manufactures, as may enable them to supply the demands of America from their own stock, and to exclude fo∣reigners from a branch of commerce which has been so fatal to the kingdom. This they have endea∣voured to accomplish, by a variety of edicts issued since the peace of Utrecht. They have granted bounties for the encouragement of some branches of industry; they have lowered the taxes on others; they have either entirely prohibited, or have loaded with additional duties, such foreign manufactures as come in competition with their own; they have instituted societies for the improvement of trade and agriculture; they have planted colonies of hus∣bandmen in some uncultivated districts of Spain, and divided among them the waste fields; they have had recourse to every expedient, devised by com∣mercial wisdom, or commercial jealousy, for reviv∣ing their own industry, and discountenancing that of other nations. These, however, it is not my
<PB N="431" REF="034476_0937_0FFDDDC03125AE28"/>
province to explain, or to enquire into their pro∣priety and effects. There is no effort of legislation more arduous, no experiment in policy more un∣certain, than an attempt to revive the spirit of in∣dustry where it has declined, or to introduce it where it is unknown. Nations already possessed of extensive commerce, enter into competition with such advantages, derived from the large capitals and extensive credit of their merchants, the dexte∣rity of their manufactures, the alertness acquired by habit in every department of business, that the state which aims at rivalling, or supplanting them, must expect to struggle with many difficulties, and be content to advance slowly. If the quantity of productive industry, now in Spain, be compared with that of the kingdom under the last listless mo∣narchs of the Austrian line, its progress must ap∣pear considerable, and is sufficient to alarm the jea∣lousy, and to call forth the most vigorous efforts, of the nations now in possession of the lucrative trade which the Spaniards aim at wresting from them. One circumstance may render those exertions of Spain an object of more serious attention to the other European powers. They are not to be ascribed wholly to the influence of the crown and its mini∣sters. The sentiments and spirit of the people seem to second the provident care of their monarchs, and to give it greater effect. The nation has adopted more liberal ideas, not only with respect to commerce, but domestic policy. In all the later Spanish writers, defects in the arrangements of their country concerning both are acknowledged, and remedies proposed, which ignorance rendered their ancestors incapable of discerning, and pride would not have allowed them to confess<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XCVII.</NOTE>. But after all that the Spaniards have done, much remains to do.
<PB N="432" REF="034476_0938_0FFDDDC41D2BAE90"/>
Many pernicious institutions and abuses, deeply in∣corporated with the system of internal policy and taxation, which has been long established in Spain must be abolished, before industry and manufactures can recover an extensive activity.</P>
<P><NOTE PLACE="marg">Contraband trade.</NOTE>STILL, however the commercial regulations of Spain with respect to her colonies are too rigid and systematical to be carried into complete exe∣cution. The legislature that loads trade with im∣positions too heavy, or fetters it by restrictions too severe, defeats its own intention; and is only mul∣tiplying the inducements to violate its statutes, and proposing an high premium to encourage illicit traffic. The Spaniards, both in Europe and Ame∣rica, being circumscribed in their mutual intercourse by the jealousy of the crown, or oppressed by its exactions, have their invention continually on the stretch how to elude its edicts. The vigilance and ingenuity of private interest discover means of effecting this, which public wisdom cannot foresee, nor public authority prevent. This spirit counter-acting that of the laws, pervades the commerce of Spain with America in all its branches; and from the highest departments in government, descends to the lowest. The very officers appointed to check contraband trade are often employed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> instruments in carrying it on; and the boards instituted to re∣strain and punish it, are the channels through which it flows. The king is supposed, by the most in∣telligent Spanish writers, to be defrauded, by vari∣ous artifices, of more than one half of the revenue which he ought to receive from America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Solorz. de Ind. Jure, ii. lib. v.</NOTE>; and as long as it is the interest of so many persons to screen those artifices from detection, the knowledge of them will never reach the throne. <Q>How many ordinances, says Corita, how many instructions,
<PB N="433" REF="034476_0939_0FFDDDC6B8C6E598"/>
how many letters from our sovereign, are sent in order to correct abuses, and how little are they ob∣served, and what small advantages is derived from them! To me the old observation appears just, that where there are many physicians, and many medicines, there is a want of health; where there are many laws, and many judges, there is want of justice. We have viceroys, pre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ents, go∣vernors, oydors, corrigidors, alcaldes, and thou∣sands of alguazils abound every where; but not∣withstanding all these, public abuses continue to multiply<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">MS. penes me.</NOTE>.</Q> Time has increased the evils which he lamented as early as the reign of Philip II. A spirit of corruption has infected all the colonies of Spain in America. Men far removed from the seat of government; impatient to acquire wealth, that they may return speedily from what they are apt to consider as a state of exile in a remote un∣healthful country; allured by opportunities too tempting to be resisted, and seduced by the ex∣ample of those around them; find their sentiments of honour and of duty gradually relax. In private life, they give themselves up to a dissolute luxury, while in their public conduct they become unmind∣ful of what they owe to their sovereign and to their country.</P>
<P>BEFORE I close this account of the Spanish trade in America, there remains one detached,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trade be∣tween New Spain and the Philip∣pines.</NOTE> but im∣portant branch of it, to be mentioned. Soon after his accession to the throne, Philip II. formed a scheme of planting a colony in the Philippine islands, which had been neglected since the time of their discovery; and he accomplished it by means of an armament fitted out from New Spain<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Torquem. i. lib. v. c. 14.</NOTE>. Manila,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1564.</NOTE>
<PB N="434" REF="034476_0940_0FFDDDC84B075570"/>
in the island of Luconia, was the station chosen for the capital of this new establishment. From it an active commercial intercourse began with the Chi∣nese, and a considerable number of that industrious people, allured by the prospect of gain, settled in the Philippine islands under the Spanish protection. They supplied the colony so amply with all the valuable productions and manufactures of the East, as enabled it to open a trade with America, by a course of navigation, the longest from land to land on our globe. In the infancy of this trade, it was carried on with Callao, on the coast of Peru; but experience having discovered the impropriety of fixing upon that as the port of communication with Manila, the staple of the commerce between the east and west was removed from Callao to Acapul∣co, on the coast of New Spain.</P>
<P>AFTER various arrangements, it has been brought into a regular form. One or two ships depart an∣nually from Acapulco, which are permitted to carry out silver to the amount of five hundred thousand pesos<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Recop. lib. ix. c. 45 l 6.</NOTE>, but they have hardly any thing else of value on board; in return for which, they bring back spices, drugs, china, and japan wares, callicoes, chintz, mu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lins, silks, and every precious article, with which the benignity of the climate, or the in∣genuity of its people, has enabled the East to supply <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rest of the world. For some time the mer∣chants of Peru were admitted to participate in this traine, and might send annually a ship to Acapulco. to wait the arrival of the vessels from Manila, and receive a proportional share of the commodities which they imported. At length, the Peruvians were excluded from this trade by most rigorous
<PB N="435" REF="034476_0941_0FFDDDCC00330E50"/>
edicts, and all the commodities from the East re∣served solely for the consumption of New Spain.</P>
<P>IN consequence of this indulgence, the inhabitants of that country enjoy advantages unknown in the other Spanish colonies. The manufactures of the East are not only more suited to a warm climate, and more showy than those of Europe, but can be sold at a lower price; while, at the same time, the profits upon them are so considerable, as to enrich all those who are employed, either in bringing them from Manila, or vending them in New Spain. As the interest both of the buyer and seller concurred in favouring this branch of commerce, it has continu∣ed to extend in spite of regulations, concerted with the most anxious jealousy to circumscribe it. Un∣der cover of what the laws permit to be imported, great quantities of India goods are poured into the markets of New Spain<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XCVIII.</NOTE>, and when the slota arrives at Vera Cruz from Europe, it often finds the wants of the people already supplied by cheaper and more acceptable commodities.</P>
<P>THERE is not, in the commercial arrangements of Spain, any circumstance more inexplicable than the permission of this trade between New Spain and the Philippines, or more repugnant to its fun∣damental maxim of holding the colonies in perpe∣tual dependence on the mother-country, by pro∣hibiting any commercial intercourse that might suggest to them the idea of receiving a supply of their wants from any other quarter. This permis∣sion must appear still more extraordinary, from considering that Spain herself carries on no direct trade with her settlements in the Philippines, and grants a privilege to one of her American colonies, which she denies to her subjects in Europe. It is
<PB N="436" REF="034476_0942_0FFDDDCE9C4B6880"/>
probable, that the colonists who originally took possession of the Philippines, having been sent out from New Spain, began this intercourse with a country which they considered, in some measure, as their parent state, before the court of Madrid was aware of its consequences, or could establish regulations in order to prevent it. Many remon∣strances have been presented against this trade, as detrimental to Spain, by diverting into another channel a large portion of that treasure which ought to flow into the kingdom, as tending to give rise to a spirit of independence in the colonies, and to encourage innumerable frauds, against which it is impossible to guard, in transactions so far re∣moved from the inspection of government. But as it requires no slight effort of political wisdom and vigour to abolish any practice which numbers are interested in supporting, and to which time has added the sanction of its authority, the commerce between New Spain and Manila seems to be as con∣siderable as ever, and may be considered as one chief cause of the elegance and splendor conspicu∣ous in this part of the Spanish dominions.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding this general corruption in the colonies of Spain,<NOTE PLACE="marg">P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>olic re∣venue from America.</NOTE> and the diminution of the income belonging to the public, occasioned by the illicit importations made by foreigners, as well as by the various frauds of which the colonists them∣selves are guilty in their commerce with the parent state, the Spanish monarchs receive a very consi∣derable revenue from their American dominions. This arises from taxes of various kinds, which may be divided into three capital branches. The first contains what is paid to the king, as sove∣reign, or superior lord of the New World: to this class belongs the duty on the gold and silver raised
<PB N="437" REF="034476_0943_0FFDDDD138BBBE20"/>
from the mines, and the tribute exacted from the Indians; the former is termed by the Spaniards the <HI>right of signiory,</HI> the latter is the <HI>duty of vasulage.</HI> The second branch comprehends the numerous du∣ties upon commerce, which accompany and oppress it in every step of its progress, from the greatest transactions of the wholesale merchant, to the petty traffic of the vendor by retail. The third includes what accrues to the king, as head of the church, and administrator of ecclesiastical funds in the New World. In consequence of this he receives the first fruits, annates, spoils, and other spiritual revenues, levied by the apostolic chamber in Europe; and is entitled, likewise, to the profit arising from the sale of the bull of Cruzado. This bull, which is pub∣lished every two years, contains, an absolution from past offences by the pope, and, among other immu∣nities, a permission to eat several kinds of prohibited food, during Lent, and on m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gre days. The monks employed in dispersing those bulls, extol their vir∣tues with all the fervour of interested eloquence; the people, ignorant and credulous, listen with im∣plicit assent; and every person in the Spanish colo∣nies, of European, Cre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lian, or mixed race, pur∣chases a bull, which is deemed essential to his sal∣vation, at the rate set upon it by government<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE XCIX.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT may be the amount of those various funds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its amount.</NOTE> it is almost impossible to determine with preci∣sion. The extent of the Spanish dominions in America, the jealousy of government, which ren∣ders them inaccessible to foreigners, the mysterious silence which the Spaniards are accustomed to ob∣serve with respect to the interior state of their colo∣nies, combine in covering this subject with a veil, which it is not easy to remove. But an ac∣count,
<PB N="438" REF="034476_0944_0FFDDDD3D8DDBCE8"/>
apparently no less accurate than it is cu∣rious, has lately been published of the royal re∣venue in New Spain, from which we may form some idea with respect to what is collected in the other provinces. According to that account, the crown does not receive from all the departments of taxation in New Spain above a million of our money, from which one half must be deducted as the expence of the provincial establishment<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE C.</NOTE>. Peru, it is probable, yields a sum not inferior to this; and if we suppose that all the other regions of America, including the islands, furnish a third share of equal value, we shall not perhaps be far wide from the truth, if we conclude, that the net public revenue of Spain, raised in America, does not exceed a million and a half sterling. This falls far short of the immense sums to which sup∣positions, founded upon conjecture, have raised the Spanish revenue in America<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE CI.</NOTE>. It is remark∣able, however, upon one account. Spain and Por∣tugal are the only European powers, who derive a direct revenue from their colonies. All the ad∣vantage that accrues to other nations, from their American dominions, arises from the exclusive en∣joyment of their trade; but beside this, Spain has brought her colonies to contribute towards in∣creasing the power of the state; and in return for protection, to bear a proportional share of the com∣mon burden.</P>
<P>ACCORDINGLY, the sum which I have computed to be the amount, of the Spanish revenue from America, arises wholly from the taxes collected there, and is far from being the whole of what accrues to the king from his dominions in the New World. The heavy duties imposed on the commo∣dities
<PB N="439" REF="034476_0945_0FFDDDD56AF12230"/>
exported from Spain to America<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See NOTE CII.</NOTE>, as well as what is paid by those which she sends home in re∣turn; the tax upon the negro-slaves, with which Africa supplies the New World, together with se∣veral smaller branches of finance, bring large sums into the treasury, the precise extent of which I can∣not pretend to ascertain.</P>
<P>BUT if the revenue which Spain draws from America be great,<NOTE PLACE="marg"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> the expence of administration in her colonies bears proportion to it. In every department, even of her domestic police and finances, Spain has adopted a system more com∣plex, and more encumbered with a variety of tri∣bunals, and a multitude of officers, than that of any European nation, in which the sovereign pos∣sesses such extensive power. From the jealous spirit with which Spain watches over her American settle∣ments, and her endeavours to guard against fraud in provinces so remote from inspection; boards and officers have been multiplied there with still more anxious attention. In a country where the expence of living is great, the salaries allotted to every person in public office must be high, and must load the revenue with an immense burden. The parade of government greatly augments the weight of it. The viceroys of Mexico, Peru, and the New Kingdom of Granada, as representatives of the king's person, among people fond of often∣tation, maintain all the state and dignity of royalty. Their courts are formed upon the model of that at Madrid, with horse and foot guards, a house∣hold regularly established numerous attendants, and ensigns of power, displaying such pomp, as hardly retains the appearance of a delegated autho∣rity. All the expence incurred by supporting the
<PB N="440" REF="034476_0946_0FFDDDD94E064178"/>
external and permanent order of government is defrayed by the crown. The viceroys have besides peculiar appointments suited to their exalted sta∣tion. The salaries fixed by law are indeed ex∣tremely moderate; that of the viceroy of Peru is only thirty thousand ducats; and that of the vice∣roy of Mexico, twenty thousand ducats<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Recop. lib. iii. tit. iii. c. 72.</NOTE>. Of late they have been raised to forty thousand.</P>
<P>THESE salaries, however, constitute but a small part of the revenue enjoyed by the viceroys. The exercise of an absolute authority extending to every department or government, and the power of dis∣posing of many lucrative offices, afford them many opportunities of accumulating wealth. To these, which may be considered as legal and allowed emoluments, large sums are often added by ex∣actions, which in countries so far removed from the seat of government, it is not easy to discover, and impossible to restrain. By monopolizing some branches of commerce, by a lucrative concern in others, by conniving at the frauds of merchants, a viceroy may raise such an annual revenue, as no subject of any European monarch enjoys<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See NOTE CIII.</NOTE>. From the single article of presents made to him on the anniversary of his <HI>Name-day</HI> (which is always ob∣served as an high festival), I am informed that a viceroy has been known to receive sixty thousand pesos. According to a Spanish saving, the legal revenues of a viceroy are known, his real profits depend upon his opportunities and his conscience. Sensible of this, the kings of Spain, as I have formerly observed, grant a commission to their viceroys only for a few years. This circumstance, however, renders them often more rapacious, and

adds to the ingenuity and ardour wherewith they labour to improve every moment of power which they know is hastening fast to a period; and short as its duration is, it usually affords sufficient time for repairing a shattered fortune, or for creating a new one. But even in situations so trying to hu∣man frailty, there are instances of virtue that re∣mains unseduced. In the year 1772, the Marquis de Croix finished the term of his viceroyalty in New Spain with unsuspected integrity; and in∣stead of bringing home exorbitant wealth, returned with the admiration and applause of a grateful people, whom his government had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>endered happy.</P>

<HEAD>NOTE I. p. 3.</HEAD>
<P>OUR knowledge of the events which happened in the conquest of New Spain, is derived from sources of infor∣mation more original and authentic than that of any transaction in the history of America. The letters of Cortes to the Emperor Charles V. are an historical monument, not only first in order of time, but of the greatest authenticit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and value. As Cortes earl assumed a command independent of Velasquez, it became necessary to convey such an account of his operations to Madrid, as might procure him the approbation of his sovereign.</P>
<P>THE first of his dispatches has never been made public. It was sent from Vera-Cruz, July 16th, 1519. As I imagined that it might not reach the Emperor until he arrived in Ger∣many, for which he set out early in the year 1520, in order to receive the Imperial crown; I made diligent search for a copy of this dispatch, both in Spain and in Germany, but without success This, however, is of less consequence, as it could not contain any thing very material, being written so soon after Cor∣tes arrived in New Spain. But in searching for the letter from Cortes, a copy of one from the colony of Vera-Cruz to the Em∣peror has been discovered in the Imperial library at Vienna. Of this I have subjoined some account at the close of the Notes to the second volume. The second dispatch, dated October 30th, 1520, was published at Seville, A. D. 1522, and the third and fourth soon after they were received. A Latin translation of them appeared in Germany, A. D. 1532. Ramusio soon after made them more generally known by inserting them in his valuable col∣lection. They contain a regular and minute history of the ex∣pedition,
<PB N="444" REF="034476_0949_0FFDDDE147D9A0D8"/>
with many curious particulars concerning the policy and manners of the Mexicans The work does honour to Cortes; the style is simple and perspicuous; but as it was manifestly his interest to represent his own actions in the fairest light, his victo∣ries are probably exaggerated, his losses diminished, and his acts of rigour and violence softened.</P>
<P>THE next in order is the Cronica de la Nueva Espagna, by Francisco Lopez de Gomara, published A. D. 1554 Gomara's historical merit is considerable His mode of narration is clear, flowing, always agreeable, and sometimes elegant. But he is frequently inaccurate and credulous; and as he was the domestic chaplain of Cortes after his return from New Spain and proba∣bly composed his work at his desire, it is manifest that he labours to magnify the merit of his hero▪ and to conceal or extenuate such transactions as were unfavourable to his character. Of this Herrera accuses him in one instance, Dec. ii. lib. iii. c. 2 and it is not once only that this is conspicuous. He writes, however, with so much freedom concerning several measures of the Spanish court, that the copies both of his Historia de las Indias, and of his Cronica, were called in by a decree of the counci<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Indies, and they were long considered as prohibited books in Spain; it is only of late that licence to print them has been gran∣ted. Pinelo Biblioth 589.</P>
<P>THE Chronicle of Gomara induced Bernal Diaz del Castillo to compose his Historia Verdadera de la Conquista de la Nueva Espagna. He had been an adventurer in each of the expeditions to New Spain, and was the companion of Cortes in all his bat∣tles and perils. When he found that neither he himself, nor many of his fellow-soldiers, were once mentioned by Gomara, but that the fame of all their exploits was ascribed to Cortes; the gallant veteran laid hold of his pen with indignation, and com∣posed his true history. It contains a prolix, minute, confused narrative of all Cortes's operations, in such a rude vu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gar style as might be expected from an illiterate soldier. But as he relates transactions of which he was witness, and in which he performed a considerable part, his account bears al the marks of authenticity, and is accompanied with such a pleasant <HI>naivete,</HI> with such inter∣esting details, with such amusing vanity, and yet so pardonable in an old soldier who had been (as he boasts) in a hundred and nine∣teen battles, as renders his book one of the most singular that is to be found in any language.</P>
<P>PET. Martyr ab Angleria, in a treatise de Insulis nuper in∣ventis, added to his Decades de Rebus Oceanicis and Novo Orbe, gives some account of Cortes's expedition. But he pro∣ceeds no farther than to relate what happened after his first land∣ing. This work, which is brief and slight, seems to contain the
<PB N="445" REF="034476_0950_0FFDDDE3025B9B70"/>
information transmitted by Cortes in his first dispatches, emb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>llish∣ed with several particulars communicated to the author by the officers who brought the letters from Cortes.</P>
<P>BUT the book to which the greater part of modern historians have had recourse for information concerning the conquest of New Spain, is Historia de la Conquista de Mexico, por D. Antonio de So is, first published A D. 1684. I know no author in any language whose literary fame has risen so far beyond his real merit. De Solis is reckoned by his countrymen one of the purest writers in the Castilian tongue; and if a foreigner may venture to give his opinion concerning a matter of which Spaniards alone are quali∣fied to judge, he is entitled to that praise. But, though his lan∣guage be correct, his taste in composition is far from being just. His periods are so much laboured as to be often stiff, and some∣times tumid▪ the figures which he employs by way of ornament, are frequently trite or improper, and his observations superficia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. These blemishes, however, might easil<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be overlooked, if he were not defective with respect to all the great qualities of an historian. Destitute of that patient industry in research, which conducts to the knowledge of truth; a stranger to that impar∣tiality which weighs evidence with cool attention; and ever eager to establish his favourite system of exalting the character of Cortes into that of a perfect hero, exempt from error, and adorned with every virtue; he is less solicitous to discover what was true, than to relate what might appear splendid. When he attempts any critical discussion, his reasonings are sallacious, and founded upon an imperfect view of facts. Though he sometimes quotes the <HI>dispatches</HI> of Cortes, he seems not to have consulted them; and though he sets out with some censure on Gomara, he frequently prefers his authority, the most doubtful of any, to that of the other contemporary historians.</P>
<P>BUT of all the Spanish writers, Herrera furnishes the fullest and most accurate information concerning the conquest of Mexico, as well as every other transaction of America. The industry and attention with which he consulted not only the books, but the original papers and public records, which tended to throw any light upon the subject of his inquiries, were so great, and he usually judges of the evidence before him with so much impar∣tiality and candour, that his decads may be ranked among the most judicious and useful historical collections. If by attempting to relate the various occurrences in the New World in a strict chronological order, the arrangement of events in his work had not been rendered so perplexed, disconnected, and obscure, that it is an unpleasant task to co<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lect from different parts of his book, and piece together the detached shreds of a story, he might justly have been ranked among the most eminent historians of his coun∣try.

<P>IN those different conflicts, the Spaniards lost only two men, but had a considerable number wounded. Though there be no occasion for recourse to any supernatural cause to account either
<PB N="447" REF="034476_0952_0FFDDDE83B5577E8"/>
for the greatness of their victories, or the smallness of their loss; the Spanish historians fail not to ascribe both to the patronage of St. James, the tut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lar Saint of their country, who, as the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> relate, fought <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the head of their countrymen, and by his prowess gave a turn to the fate of the battle. Gomara is the first who mentions this apparition of St. James. It is amusing to observe the embarras∣ment of B. Diaz de Castillo, occasioned by the struggle between his superstition and his veracity. The former disposed him to be∣lieve this miracle, the latter restrained him from attesting it. "I acknowledge says he, that all our exploits and victories are owing to our Lord Jesus Christ and that in this battle there was such a number of Indians to every one of us, that if each had thrown a handful of earth they might have buried us, if by the great mercy of God we had not been protected. It may be that the person whom Gomara mentions as having appeared on a mott<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed grey horse, was the glorious apostle Signor San Jago or Signor San Pedro, and that I, as being a sinner, was not worthy to see him. This I know, that I saw Francisca de Mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a on such a horse, but as an unworthy transgressor, did not deserve to see any of the holy apostles. It may have been the will of God, that it was so as Gomara relates but until I read his Chronicle I never heard among any of the conquerors that such a thing had happened." Cap. 34.</P>

<P>SEVERAL Spanish historians relate this occurrence in such terms, as if they wished it should be believed, that the Indians, loaded with the presents had carried them from the capital in the same short space of time that the couriers performed that journey. This in incredible, and Gomara mentions a circumstance which shews, that nothing extraordinary happened on this occasion. This rich present had been prepared for Grijalva, when he touched at the same place some months before, and was now ready to be delivered, as soon as Montezuma sent orders for that purpose.

<P>THERE is no circumstance in the history of the conquest of America, which is more questionable than the account of the numerous armies brought into the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> against the Spaniards. As the war with the republic of Tlascala, though of short dura∣tion, was one of the most considerable which the Spaniards waged in America, the account given of the Tlascalan armies merits some attention. The only authentic information concerning this is derived from three authors. Cortes in his second dispatch to the emperor, dated at Segura de la Frontera, October 30, 1520, thus estimates the number of their troops; in the first battle 6000; in the second battle 100,000▪ in the third battle 150,000. Re∣lat. ap. Ramus. iii 228. Bernal Diaz del Castillo, who was an eye-witness, and engaged in all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tions of this war, thus reck∣ons their numbers; in the first battle 3000, p. 43; in the second battle 6000, ibid. in the third battle 50,000. p. 45. Gomara, who was Cortes's chaplain after his return to Spain and published his <HI>Cronica</HI> in 1552, follows the computation o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cortes, except in the second battle, where he reckons. the Tlascalans at 80,000. p. 40. It was manifestly the inter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t of Cortes to magnify his own dangers and exploits. For it was only by the merit of extra∣ordinary services, that he could hope to atone for his irregular con∣duct, in assuming an independent command. Bern. Diaz, though abundanly disposed to place his own prowess, and that of his fel∣low conquerors, in the most advantage us point of light, had not the same temptation to exaggerate; and it is probable, that his ac∣count of the numbers approaches nearer to the truth. The assem∣bling of an army of 150,000 m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n requires many previous ar∣rangements,
<PB N="449" REF="034476_0954_0FFDDDEE0B133C50"/>
and such provision for their subsistence as seems to be beyond the foresight of Americans. The degree of cultivation in Tlascala does not seem to have been so great, as to have furnish∣ed such a vast army with provisions. Though this province was so much better cultivated than other regions of New Spain, that it was called the <HI>country of bread;</HI> yet the Spaniards in their march suffered such want, that they were obliged to subsist upon <HI>Tunas,</HI> a species of fruit which gro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> wild in the fields.

<P>THESE unhappy victims are said to be persons of distinction. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t seems improbable that so great a number as fifty should be employed as spies. So many prisoners had been taken and dis∣missed, and the Tlascalans had sent so many messages to the Spa∣nish quarters, that there appears to be no reason for hazarding the lives of so many considerable people, in order to procure informa∣tion about the position and state of their camp. The barbarous manner in which Cortes treated a people unacquainted with the laws of war established among polished nations, appears so shock∣ing to the later Spanish writers, that they diminish the number of those whom h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> punished so cruelly Herrera says, that he cut off the hands of seven, and thumbs of some more.

<P>ACCORDING to Bart, de las Casas, there was no reason for this massacre, and it was an act of wanton cruelty, perpetrated merely to strike terror into the people of New Spain. Relac. de la Destruyc. p. 17, &amp;c. But the zeal of Las Casas often leads him to exaggerate. In opposition to him, Bern. Diaz, c. 83, asserts, that the first missionaries sent into New Spain by the emperor, made a judicial enquiry into this transaction; and having examined the priests and elders of Cholula, found that there was a real conspiracy to cut off the Spaniards, and that the account given by Cortes was exactly true. As it was the object of Cortes at that time, and manifestly his interest, to gain the good-will of Montezuma, it is improbable, that he should have taken a step which tended so visibly to alienate him from the Spaniards, if he had not believed it to be necessary for his own preservation. At the same time, the Spaniards who served in America had such contempt for the natives, and thought them so little entitled to the common rights of men, that Cortes might hold the Cholulans to be guilty upon slight and imperfect evi∣dence. The severity of the punishment was certainly excessive and atrocious.</P>

<P>B. DIAS del Castillo gives us some idea of the fatigue and hardships they underwent in performing this, and other parts of duty. During the nine months that they remained in Mexico, every man, without any distinction between officers and soldiers, slept on his arms in his quilted jacket and gorget. They lay on mats, or straw spread on the floor, and each was obliged to
<PB N="451" REF="034476_0956_0FFDDDF34DFD0248"/>
hold himself as alert as if he had been on guard. "This, adds he, became so habitual to me, that even now in my advanced age, I always sleep in my clothes, and never in any bed. When I visit my <HI>Encomienda,</HI> I reckon it suitable to my rank, to have a bed carried with my other baggage, but I never go into it; but, according to custom, I lie in my clothes, and walk frequently during the night into the open air, to view the stars as I was wont when in service."

<P>CORTES himself, in his second dispatch to the emperor, does not explain the motives which induced him either to condemn Qualpopoca to the flames, or to put Montezuma in irons. Ramus. iii 236. B. Diaz is silent with respect to his reasons for the for∣mer; and the only cause he assigns for the latter was that he might meet with no interruption in executing the sentence pronounced against Qualpopoca, c. xcv. p. 75. But as Montezuma was his prisoner, and absolutely in his power, he had no reason to dread him, and the insult offered to that monarch could have no effect but to irritate him unnecessarily. Gomara supposes, that Cortes had no other object than to occupy Montezuma with his own dis∣tress and sufferings, that he might give less attention to what befel Qualpopoca Cron. c. 89. Herrera adopts the same opinion. Dec. ii. lib. viii. c. 9. But it seems an odd expedient, in order to make a person bear one injury, to load him with another that is greater. De Solis imagines, that Cortes had nothing else in view than to intimidate Montezuma, so that he might make no attempt to rescue the victims from their fate; but the spirit of that mo∣narch was so submissive, and he had so tamely given up the prisoners to the disposal of Cortes, that he had no cause to apprehend any op∣position from him. If the explanation which I have attempted to give of Cortes's proceedings on this occasion be not admitted, it appears to me, that they must be reckoned among the wanton and barbarous acts of oppression which occur too often in the history of the conquest of America.</P>

<P>DE Solis asserts, lib. iv. c. 3. that the proposition of doing ho∣mage to the King of Spain, came from Montezuma him∣self, and was made in order to induce the Spaniards to depart out of his dominions. He describes his conduct on this occasion, as if
<PB N="452" REF="034476_0957_0FFDDDF701225050"/>
it had been founded upon a scheme of profound policy, and exe∣cuted with such a refined address, as to deceive Cortes himself. But there is no hint or circumstance in the contemporary historians, Cortes, Diaz, or Gomara, to justify this theor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Montezuma, on other occasions, discovered no such extent of art and abilities. The anguish which he fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t in performing this humbling ceremony is natural, if we suppose it to have been involuntary. But, ac∣cording to the theory of De Solis, which supposes that Monte∣zuma was executing what he himself had proposed, to have assumed an appearance of sorrow, would have been preposterous and incon∣sistent with his own design of deceiving the Spaniards.</P>

Diaz del Castillo, of Gomara, and of Herrera. They all concur indeed, in mentioning this inconsiderate step which Cortes took; and they had good reason to do so, for Cortes himself relates this exploit in his second dispatch to the Emperor, and seems to glory in it. Cort. Relat. Ramus. iii. 140, D.

<P>HERRERA and de Solis suppose, that Velasquez was en∣couraged to equip this armament against Cortes, by the ac∣counts which he received from Spain concerning the reception of the agents sent by the colony of Vera Cruz, and the warmth with which Fonseca bishop of Burgos had espoused his interest, and condemned the proceedings of Cortes. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. ix. c. 18. De Solis, lib. iv c. 5. But the chronological order of events refutes this supposition. Portocarrero and Montejo sailed from Vera Cruz July 26, 1519. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. v. c. 4. They landed at St. Lucar in October, according to Herrera, ibid. But P Martyr, who attended the court at that time, and communicated every occurrence of moment to his correspondents day by day, mentions the arrival of these agents for the first time, in December, and speaks of it as a recent event. Epist. 650. All the histopians agree, that the agents of Cortes had their first audience of the Emperor at Tordesillas, when he went to that town to visit his mother in his way to St. Jago de Compostella. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. v. c 4. De Solis, lib. iv. c. 5. But the emperor set out from Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ladolid for Tordesillas, on the 11th of March 1520; and P. Martyr mentions his having seen at that time the presents made to Charles, Epist. 1665. The arma∣ment under Narvaez sailed from Cuba in April 1520. It is manifest then, that Velasquez could not receive any account of what passed in this interview at Tordesillas, previous to his hostile preparations against Cortes. His real motives seem to be those which I have mentioned. The patent appointing him <HI>Adelantado</HI> of New Spain, with such extensive powers, bears date November 13, 1519. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. iii. c. 11. He might receive it about the beginning of January. Gomara takes notice, that as soon as this patent was delivered to him, he began to equip a fleet and levy forces, Cron. c. 96.</P>

<P>DE Solis contends, that as Narvaez had no interpreters, he could hold no intercourse with the people of the provinces, nor converse with them in any way but by signs, and that it was equally impossible for him to carry on any communication with Montezuma. Lib. iv. c. 7. But it is upon the authority of Cortes himself that I relate all the particulars of Narvaez's cor∣respondence both with Montezuma and with his subjects in the maritime provinces. Relat. Ramus. iii. 244, A. C. Cortes
<PB N="454" REF="034476_0959_0FFDDDFCD5622AB8"/>
affirms, that there was a mode of intercourse between Narvaez and the Mexicans, but does not explain how it was carried on. Bernal Diaz supplies this defect, and informs us, that the three deserters who joined Narvaez as interpreters, having acquired a competent knowledge of the language, c. 110. With his usual minuteness, he mentions their names and characters, and relates, in chapter 122, how they were punished for their perfidy. The Spaniards had now resided above a year among the Mexicans; and it is not surprising, that several among them should have made some proficiency in speaking their language. This seems to have been the case. Herrera, dec. ii. lib. x. c. 1. Both B. Diaz, who was present, and Herrera, the most accurate and best in∣formed of all the Spanish writers, agree with Cortes in his ac∣count of the secret correspondence carried on with Montezuma. Dec. ii. lib. ix. c. 18, 19. De Solis seems to consider it as a discredit to Cortes, his hero, that Montezuma should have been ready to engage in a correspondence with Narvaez. He sup∣poses that monarch to have contracted such a wonderful affec∣tion for the Spaniards, that he was not solicitous to be delivered from them. After the indignity with which he had been treated, such an affection is incredible; and even De Solis is obliged to acknowledge, that it must be looked upon as one of the miracles which God had wrought to facilitate the conquest, lib. iv. c. 7. The truth is, Montezuma, however much overawed by his dread of the Spaniards, was extremely impatient to recover his li∣berty.</P>

<P>THE contemporary historians differ considerably with respect to the loss of the Spaniards on this occasion. Cortes, in his second dispatch to the emperor, makes the number only 150, Relat. ap. Ramus. iii. p. 249, A. But it was mani∣festly
<PB N="455" REF="034476_0960_0FFDDDFF7291C148"/>
his interest, at that juncture, to conceal from the court of Spain the full extent of the loss which he had sustained. De Solis, always studious to diminish every misfortune that besel his countrymen, rates their loss at about two hundred men. Lib. iv▪ c. 19. B. Diaz affirms, that they lost 870 men, and that only 440 escaped from Mexico, c. 128. p. 108, B. Palafox, bishop of Loss Angeles, who seems to have enquired into the carry transactions of his countrymen in New Spain, with great attention, confirms the account of B. Diaz, with respect to the extent of their loss. Virtudes del Indio, p. 22. Gomara states their loss at 450 men. Cron. c. 109. Some months afterwards, when Cortes had received several re∣inforcements, he mustered his troops, and found them to be only 590. Relat. ap. Ramus. iii. p. 255, E. Now, as Nar∣vaez brought 880 men into New Spain, and about 450 of Cortes's soldiers were then a ive, it is evident, that his loss, in the retreat from Mexico, must have been much more conside∣rable than what he mentions. B. Diaz, solicitous to mag∣nify the dangers and sufferings to which he and his fellow-con∣querors were exposed, may have exaggerated their loss; but, in my opinion, it cannot well be estimated at less than 600 men.</P>

with high spirit. But from that time I never advanced to fight the Mexicans without a secret horror and anxiety; my heart trembled at the thoughts of the death which I had seen them suffer." He takes care to add, that as soon as the combat be∣gan his terror went off; and, indeed, his adventurous bravery on every occasion is full evidence of this. B. Diaz, c. 156. p. 157, a.</P>

<P>ONE circumstance in this siege merits particular no∣tice.—The account which the Spanish writers give of the numerous armies employed in the attack or defence of Mexico, seems to be incredible According to Cortes him∣self, he had at one time 150,000 auxiliary Indians in his ser∣vice. Relat. Ramus, iii. 275. E. Gomara asserts, that they were above 200,000. Cron. c. 136 Herrera, an author of higher authority, says, they were about 200,000. Dec. iii. lib. i. c. 19. None of the contemporary writers ascertain explicitly the number of persons in Mexico during the siege. But Cortes on several occasions mentions the number of Mexi∣cans who were slain, or who perished for want of food; and, if we may rely on those circumstances, it is probable that above two hundred thousand must have been shut up in the town. But the quantity of provisions necessary for the subsistence of such vast multitudes assembled in one place during three months, is so great, and it requires so much foresight and arrangement to col∣lect these, and lay them in magazines, so as to be certain of a regular supply, that one can hardly believe that this could be ac∣complished in a country where agriculture was so imperfect as in the Mexican empire, where there were no t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e animals, and by a people naturally so improvident, and so incapable of executing a complicated plan as the most improved Americans. The Spa∣niards, with all their care and attention, far<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> very poorly, and were often reduced to extreme distress for want of provisions. B. Diaz, p. 142. Cortes Relat. 271, D. Cortes on one occasion mentions slightly the subsistence of his army; and after acknowledging that they were often in great want, adds that they received supplies from the people of the country, of fish, and of some fruit, which he calls the cherries of the country. Ibid. B. Diaz says, that they had cakes of maize, and serasas de la ti∣erra; and when the season of these was over, another <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which he calls <HI>Tu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>as;</HI> but their most comfortable subsistence was a root which the Indians use as food, to which he gives the name of <HI>Q<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>es.</HI> p. 142. The Indian auxiliaries had one
<PB N="457" REF="034476_0962_0FFDDE0415FC8E28"/>
means of subsistence more than the Spaniards. They fed upon the bodies of the Mexicans whom they killed in battle. Cortes Relat. 176, C. B. Diaz confirms his relation, and adds, that when the Indians returned from Mexico to their own country, they carried with them large quantities of the flesh of the Mexi∣cans salted or dried, as a most acceptable present to their friends, that they might have the pleasure of feeding upon the bodies of their enemies in their festivals, p. 157. De Solis, who seems to consider it as an imputation of discredit to his countrymen, that they should act in concert with auxiliaries who fed upon human flesh, is solicitous to prove, that the Spaniards endeavoured to prevent their associates from eating the bodies of the Mexicans, lib. v. c. 24. But he has no authority for this from the original historians. Neither Cortes himself▪ nor B. Diaz, seem to have had any such scruple; and, on many occasions, mentions the In∣dian repasts, which were become familiar to them, without any mark of abhorrence. Even with this additional stock of food for the Indians, it was hardly possible to procure subsistence for ar∣mies amounting to such numbers as we find in the Spanish writers. Perhaps the best solution of the difficulty is, to adopt the opinion of B. Diaz del Castillo, the most artless of all the <HI>Historiadores primitivos.</HI> "When Gomara (says he) on some occasions re∣lates, that there were so many thousand Indians our auxiliaries, and others, that there were so many thousand houses in this or that town, no regard is to be paid to his enumeration, as he has no authority for it, the numbers not being in reality the fifth of what he relates. If we add together the different numbers which he mentions, that country would contain more millions than there are in Castile." C. 129. But though some considerable de∣duction should certainly be made from the Spanish accounts of the Mexican forces, they must have been very numerous; for nothing but an immense superiority in number could have enabled them to withstand a body of nine hundred Spaniards, conducted by a leader of such abilities as Cortes.</P>

terms, c. 162. Herrera, solicitous to extenuate this barbarous action of his countrymen, though he mentions 63 caziques, and 400 men of note, as being condemned to the flames, asserts, that 30 only were burnt, and the rest pardoned. Dec. iii. lib. v. c. 7. But this is contrary to the testimony of the original historians, particularly of Gomara, whom it appears he had consulted, as he adopts several of his expressions in this passage. The punish∣ment of Guatimozin is related by the most authentic of the Spa∣nish writers. Torquemada has extracted from a history of Te∣zeuco, composed in the Mexican tongue, an account of this transaction, more favourable to Guatimozin than that of the Spa∣nish authors. Mon. Indiana, i. 575. According to the Mexi∣can account, Cortes had scarcely a shadow of evidence to justify such a wanton act of cruelty. B. Diaz affirms, that Guatimozin and his fellow-sufferers asserted their innocence with their last breath, and that many of the Spanish soldiers condemned this ac∣tion of Cortes as equally unnecessary and unjust, p. 200, b. 201, a.</P>

<P>THE motive for undertaking this expedition was, to punish Christoval de Olid, one of his officers, who had revolted against him, and aimed at establishing an independent jurisdiction. Cortes regarded this insurrection as of such dangerous example, and dreaded so much the abilities and popularity of its author, that in person he led the body of troops destined to suppress it. He marched, according to Gomara, three thousand miles, through a country abounding with thick forests, rugged mountains, deep rivers, thinly inhabited, and cultivated only in a few places. What he suffered from famine, from the hostility of the natives, from the climate, and from hardships of every species, has no∣thing in history parallel to it, but what occurs in the adventures of the other discoverers and conquerors of the New World. Cortes was employed in this dreadful service above two years, and though it was not distinguished by any splendid event, he exhi∣bited, during the course of it, greater personal courage, more fortitude of mind, more perseverance and patience, than in any other period or scene in his life.

<P>IN tracing the progress of the Spanish arms in New Spain, we have followed Cortes himself as our most certain guide. His dispatches to the emperor contain a minute account of his opera∣tions. But the unlettered conqueror of Peru was incapable of relating his own exploits. Our information with respect to them, and other transactions in Peru, is derived however from contem∣porary and respectable authors.</P>
<P>THE most early account of Pizarro's transactions in Peru, was published by Franciso de Xerez, his secretary. It is a sim∣ple unadorned narrative, carried down no farther than the death of Atahualpa in 1533; for the author returned to Spain in 1534, and soon after he landed, printed at Seville his short History of the Conquest of Peru, addressed to the emperor.</P>
<P>DON PEDRO SANCHO, an officer who served under Pizarro, drew up an account of his expedition, which was translated into Italian by Ramusio, and inserted in his valuable collection, but has never been published in its original language. Sancho re∣turned to Spain at the same time with Xerez. Great credit is
<PB N="460" REF="034476_0965_0FFDDE0C002CD878"/>
due to what both these authors relate concerning the progress and operations of Pizarro; but the residence of the Spaniards in Peru had been so short, at the time w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en they left it, and their inter∣course with the natives so slender, that their knowledge of the Pe∣ruvian manners and customs is very imperfect.</P>
<P>THE next contemporary historian is Pedro Cieza de Leon, who published his Cronica del Peru, at Seville, in 1553. If he had finished all that he proposes in the general division of his work, it would have been the most complete history which had been published of any region in the New World. He was well qualified to execute it, having served during seventeen years in America, and having visited in person most of the provinces concerning which he had occasion to write. But only the first part of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hronicle has been printed. It contains a description of Peru, and several of the adjacent provinces, with an account of the institutions and customs of the natives, and is written with so little art, and such an apparent regard for truth, that one must regret the loss of the other parts of his work.</P>
<P>THIS loss is amply supplied by Don Augustine Zarate, who published, in 1555, his Historia del Descubrimiento y Conquesta de la Provincia del Peru. Zarate was a man of rank and educa∣tion, and employed in Peru as comptroller-general of the public revenue. His history, whether we attend to its matter or com∣position, is a book of considerable merit; as he had an opportu∣nity to be well informed, and seems to have been inquisitive with respect to the manners and transactions of the Peruvians, great credit is due to his testimony.</P>
<P>DON DIEGO FERNANDEZ published his Historia del Peru, in 1571. His sole object is to relate the dissensions and civil wars of the Spaniards in that empire. As he served in a public station in Peru, and was well acquainted both with the country, and with the principal actors in those singular scenes which he describes, as he possessed sound understanding and great impartiality, his work may be ranked among those of the historians most distinguished for their industry in research, or their capacity in judging with respect to the events which they relate.</P>
<P>THE <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast author who can be reckoned among the contempo∣rary historians of the conquest of Peru, is Garcilasso de la Ve∣ga Inca. For though the first part of his work, intitled, <HI>Com∣mentarios Reales del Origen de los Incas Reoies del Peru,</HI> was not published sooner than the year 1609, seventy-six years after the death of Atahualpa the last emperor, yet as he was born in Peru, and was the son of an officer of distinction among the Spanish conquerors, by a <HI>Coya,</HI> or lady of the royal race, on account of which he always took the name of <HI>Inca;</HI> as he was master of the language spoken by the Incas, and acquainted
<PB N="461" REF="034476_0966_0FFDDE0FC20D8340"/>
with the traditions of his countrymen, his authority is rated very high, and often placed above that of all the other histori∣ans. His work, however, is little more than a commentary up∣on the Spanish writers of the Peruvian story, and composed of quotations taken from the authors whom I have mentioned. This is the idea which he himself gives of it, Lib. i. c. 10. Nor is it in the account of facts only that he follows them servilely. Even in explaining the institutions and rites of his ancestors, his information seems not to be more perfect than theirs. His explanation of the Quipos is almost the same with that of Acosta. He produces no specimen of Peruvian poe∣try, but that wretched one which he borrows from Blas Valera, an early missionary, whose memoirs have never been published. Lib. ii. c. 15. As for composition, arrangement, or a capa∣city of distinguishing between what is fabulous, what is proba∣ble, and what is true, one searches for them in vain in the commentaries of the Inca. His work, however notwithstand-its great defects, is not altogether destitute of use. Some tra∣ditions which he received from his countrymen are preserved in it His knowledge of the Peruvian language has enabled him to correct some errors of the Spanish writers, and he has inserted in it some curious facts, taken from authors whose works were never published, and are now lost.</P>

<P>THIS extravagant and unseasonable discourse of Valverde has been censured by all historians, and with justice. But though he seems to have been an illiterate and bigotted monk, no wise resembling the good Olmedo, who accompanied Cortes; the absurdity of his address to Atahualpa, must not be charged wholly upon him. His harangue is evidently a translation or paraphrase of that form, concerted by a junto of Spanish divines and lawyers in the year 1509, for explaining the right of their king to the so∣vereignty of the New World, and for directing the officers em∣ployed in America how they should take possession of any new country. See Vol. i. Note xxiii. The sentiments contained in Valverde's harangue must not then be imputed to the bigotted imbecility of a particular man, but to that of the age. But Go∣mara and Benzoni relate one circumstance concerning Valverde,
<PB N="463" REF="034476_0968_0FFDDE1502BE6480"/>
which, if authentic, renders him an object, not of contempt only, but of horror. They assert, that during the whole action, Val∣verde continued to excite the soldiers to slaughter, calling to them to strike the enemy, not with the edge, but with the points of their swords. Gom.

<P>TWO different systems have been formed concerning the con∣duct of Atahualpa. The Spanish writers, in order to jus∣tify the violence of their countrymen, contend, that all the In∣ca's professions of friendship were feigned; and that his intention in agreeing to an interview with Pizarro at Caxamalca, was to cut off him and his followers at one blow; that for this purpose he advanced with such a numerous body of attendants, who had arms concealed under their garments to execute this scheme. This is the account given by Xeres and Zarate, and adopted by Herrera. But if it had been the plan of the Inca to destroy the Spaniards, one can hardly imagine that he would have permitted them to march unmolested through the desert of Motupe, or have neglected to defend the passes in the mountains, where they might have been attacked with so much advantage. If the Peruvians marched to Caxamalca with an intention to fall upon the Spaniards, it is in∣conceivable, that of so great a body of men, prepared for action, not one should attempt to make resistance, but all tamely suffered themselves to be butchered by an enemy whom they were armed to attack. Atahualpa's mode of advancing to the interview, has the aspect of a peaceable procession, not of a military enterprise. He himself and his followers were, in their habits of ceremony, preceded, as on days of solemnity, by unarmed harbingers. Though rude nations are frequently cunning and false, yet, if a scheme of deception and treachery must be imputed either to a monarch▪ that had no great reason to be alarmed at a visit from strangers who solicited admission into his presence as friends, or to an adventurer so daring, and so little scrupulous as Pizarro, one cannot hesitate in determining where to fix the presumption of guilt. Even amidst the endeavour of the Spanish writers to palli∣ate the proceedings of Pizarro, one plainly perceives, that it was his intention, as well as his interest, to seize the Inca, and that he had taken measures for that purpose previous to any suspicion of that monarch's designs.</P>

He relates, that a man of majestic form, with a long beard, and garments reaching to the ground, having appeared in a vision to Viracocha, the eighth Inca, and declared, that he was a child of the Sun, that monarch built a temple in honour of this person, and erected an image of him, resembling as nearly as possible the singular form in which he had exhibited himself to his view. In this temple, divine honours were paid to him, by the name of Viracocha. P. i. lib. iv. c. 21. lib. v. c. 22. When the Spaniards first appeared in Peru, the length of their beards, and the dress they wore, struck every person so much with their likeness to the image of Viraco∣cha, that they supposed them to be children of the Sun, who had descended from heaven to earth. All concluded, that the fatal period of the Peruvian empire was now approaching, and that the throne would be occupied by new possessors. Atahualpa himself, considering the Spaniards as messengers from heaven, was so far from entertaining any thoughts of resisting them, that he determined to yield implicit obedience to their commands. From those sentiments flowed his professions of love and respect. To those were owing the cordial reception of Soto and Ferdinand Pi∣zarro in his camp, and the submissive reverence with which he himself advanced to visit the Spanish general in his quarters; but from the gross ignorance or Philipillo, the interpreter, the de∣claration of the Spaniards, and his answer to it, were so ill ex∣plained, that by their mutual inability to comprehend each other's intentions, the fatal rencounter at Caxamalca, with all its dread∣ful consequences, was occasioned.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that no traces of this superstitious veneration of the Peruvians for the Spaniards are to be found either in Xe∣res, or Sancho, or Zarate, previous to the interview at Caxamalca; and yet the two former served under Pizarro at that time, and the latter visited Peru soon after the conquest. If either the Inca himself, or his messenger, had addressed the Spaniards in the words which Garci asso puts in their mouths, they must have been struck with such submissive declarations; and they would certainly have availed themselves of them to accomplish their own designs with greater facility. Garcilasso himself, though his narrative of the intercourse between the Inca and Spani∣ards, preceding the rencounter at Caxamalca, is founded on the supposition of his believing them to be Vi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acochas, or di∣vine beings, p. ii. lib. i. c. 17, &amp;c. yet with his usual inat∣tention and inaccuracy he admits, in another place, that the
<PB N="465" REF="034476_0970_0FFDDE1986D8C6F0"/>
Peruvians did not recollect the resemblance between them and the god Viracocha, until the fatal disasters subsequent to the defeat at Caxamalca, and then only began to call them Viracochas. P. i. lib. v. c. 21. This is confirmed by Herrera, dec. 5. lib. ii. c. 12. In many different parts of America, if we may believe the Spa∣nish writers, their countrymen were considered as divine beings who had descended from Heaven. But in this instance, as in many which occur in the intercourse between nations whose pro∣gress in refinement is very unequa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the ideas of those who used the expression were different from the ideas of those who heard it. For such is the idiom of the Indian languages, or such is the simplicity of those who speak them, that when they see any thing with which they were formerly unacquainted, and of which they do not know the origin—they say, that it came down from Hea∣ven. Nugnez. Ram. iii. 327, C.</P>
<P>THE account which I have given of the sentiments and pro∣ceedings of the Peruvians, appears to be more natural and con∣sistent than either of the two preceding, and is better supported by the facts related by the contemporary historians.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to Xerez, p. 200, two thousand Peruvians were killed. Sancho makes the number of the slain six or seven thou∣sand. Ram. iii. 274, D. By Garcilasso's account, five thou∣sand were massacred. P. ii. lib. i. c. 25. The number which I have mentioned, being the medium between the extremes, may probably be nearest the truth.</P>

<P>NOTHING can be a more striking proof of this, than that three Spaniards travelled from Caxamalca to Cuzco. The distance between them is six hundred miles.

<P>THE Peruvians not only imitated the military arts of the Spaniards, but had recourse to devices of their own. As the cavalry were the chief object of their terror, they endeavoured to render them incapable of acting, by means of a long thong with a stone fastened to each end. This when thrown by a skil∣ful hand, twisted about the horse and its rider, and entangled them so as to obstruct their motions, Herrera mentions this as an inven∣tion of their own. Dec. 5. lib. viii. c 4. But as I have obser∣ved, vol. ii. p. 176, this weapon is common among several bar∣barous tribes towards the extremity of South America; and it is more probable, that the Peruvians had observed the dexterity with which they used it in hunting, and on this occasion adopted it themselves The Spaniards were considerably annoyed by it, Herrera, ibid. Another instance of the ingenuity of the Peru∣vians deserves mention. By turning a river out of its channel, they overflowed a valley, in which a body of the enemy was post∣ed, so suddenly, that it was with the utmost difficulty the Spani∣ards made their escape.

<P>IN my inquiries concerning the manners and policy of the Mexicans, I have received much information from a large manuscript of Don Alonso de Corita, one of the judges in the Court of Audience of Mexico. In the year 1553, Philip II. in order to discover the mode of levying tribute from his Indian subjects, that would be most beneficial to the crown, and least oppressive to them, addressed a mandate to all the Courts of Au∣dience in America, enjoining them to answer certain queries which he proposed to them, concerning the ancient form of government established among the various nations of Indians, and the mode in which they had been accustomed to pay taxes to their kings or chiefs. In obedience to this mandate, Corita, who had resided nineteen years in America, fourteen of which he passed in New Spain, composed the work of which I have a copy. He acquaints his sovereign, that he had made it an object during his residence in America, and in all its provinces which he had visited, to inquire diligently into the man∣ners
<PB N="470" REF="034476_0975_0FFDDE2953172948"/>
and customs of the natives, that he had conversed for this pur∣pose with many aged and intelligent Indians, and consulted several of the Spanish ecclesiastics, who understood the Indian languages most perfectly, particularly some of those who landed in New Spain soon after the conquest. Corita appears to be a man of some learning, and to have carried on his inquiries with the diligence and accuracy to which he pretends. Great∣er credit is due to his testimony from one circumstance. His work was not composed with a view to publication, or in sup∣port of any particular theory, but contains simple, though full answers to queries proposed to him officially. Though Her∣rera does not mention him among the authors whom he had followed as guides in his history, I should suppose, from several facts of which he takes notice, as well as from several expres∣sions which he uses, that this memorial of Corita was not un∣known to him.</P>

<P>THE early Spanish writers were so hasty and inaccurate in estimating the numbers of people in the provinces and towns of America, that it is impossible to ascertain that of Mexico itself with any degree of precision. Cortes de∣scribes the extent and populousness of Mexico in general terms, which imply that it was not inferior to the greatest cities in Europe. Gomara is more explicit, and affirms, that there were 60,000 houses or families in Mexico. Cron. c. 78. Herre¦ra adopts his opinion, Dec. 2. lib. vii. c. 13; and the gen¦nerality of writers follow them implicitly without inquity <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> scruple. According to this account, the inhabitants of Mexico must have been about 300,000. Torquemada, with his usual propensity to the marvellous, asserts, that there were a hundred and twenty thousand houses or families in Mexico, and consequently about six hundred thousand inhabitants. Lib. iii. c. 23. But in a very judicious account of the Mexican empire, by one of Cortes's officers, the population is fixed at 60,000 people. Ra∣musio, iii. 309. A.

<P>FROM comparing several passages in Corita and Herrera, we may collect, with some degree of accuracy, the various modes in which the Mexicans contributed towards the support of government. Some persons of the first order seem to have been exempted from the payment of any tribute, and as their only duty to the public, were bound to personal service in war, and to follow the banner of their sovereign with their vassals. 2. The imme∣diate vassals of the crown were bound not only to personal mili∣tary service, but paid a certain proportion of the produce of their lands in kind. 3. Those who held offices of honour or trust, paid a certain share of what they received in consequence of holding these. 4. Each <HI>Capullae,</HI> or association, cultivated some part of the common field allotted to it, for the behoof of the crown, and deposited the produce in the royal granaries. 5. Some part of whatever was brought to the public markets, whe∣ther fruits of the earth, or the various productions of their artists and manufacturers, was demanded for the public use, and the merchants who paid this were exempted from every other tax. 6. The <HI>May ques,</HI> or <HI>adscripti gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bae,</HI> were bound to cultivate cer∣tain districts in every province, which may be considered as <HI>crown lands,</HI> and brought the increase into public storehouses. Thus the sovereign received some part of whatever was useful or valuable in the country, whether it was the natural production of the soil, or acquired by the industry of the people. What each contributed towards the support of government, seems to have been incon∣siderable. Corita, in answer to one of the queries put to the Au∣dience

<P>CORTES, who seems to have been as much astonished with this, as with any instance of Mexican ingenuity, gives a particular description of it. Along one of the causeways, says he, by which they enter the city, are conducted two conduits, composed of clay tempered with mortar, about two paces in breadth, and raised about six feet. In one of them is conveyed a stream of excellent water, as large as the body of a man, into the centre of the city, and it supplies all the inhabitants plenti∣fully. The other is empty, that when it is necessary to clean, or repair the former, the stream of water may be turned into it. As this conduit passes along two of the bridge, where there are breaches in the causeway, through which the salt water of the lake flows, it is conveyed over them in pipes as large as the body of an ox, then carried from the conduit to the remote quarters of the city, in canoes, and sold to the inhabitants.

<P>IN the armoury of the royal palace of Madrid, are shewn suits of armour, which are called Montezuma's. They are composed of thin lacquered copper-plates. In the opinion of very intelligent judges, they are evidently eastern. The forms of the silver ornaments upon them, representing dragons, &amp;c. may be considered as a confirmation of this. They are infinitely su∣perior in point of workmanship to any effort of American art. The Spaniards probably received them from the Philippine islands. The only unquestionable specimen of Mexican art that I know of in Great Britain, is a cup of very fine gold, which is sad to have belonged to Montezuma. It weighs 5 oz. 12 dwt Three drawings of it were exhibited to the Society of Antiquaries, June 10, 1765. A man's head is represented on this cup. On one side the full face, on the other the profile, on the third the back parts of the head. The relievo is said to have been produced by punching the inside of the cup, so as to make the

<P>AS the Mexican paintings are the most curious monuments extant of the earliest made of writing, it will not be improper to give some account of the means by which they were preserved from the general wreck of every work of art in America, and communicated to the Public. For the most early and complete col∣lection of these published by Purchas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we are indebted to the atten∣tion of that curious inquirer, Hakluyt. Don Antonio Men∣doza viceroy of New Spain, having deemed those paintings a proper present for Charles V. the ship in which they were sent to Spain was taken by a French cruizer, and they came into the possession of Thevet, the king's geographer who having travelled himself into the New World, and described one of its provinces, was a curious observer of whatever tended to illustrate the man∣ners of the Americans. On his death, they were purchased by Hak∣layt, at that time chaplain of the English ambassador to the French
<PB N="474" REF="034476_0979_0FFDDE3356690B98"/>
court; and, being left by him to Purchas, were published at the desire of the learned antiquary Sir Henry Spelman. Purchas, iii. 1065. They were translated from English into French by Mel∣chizedeck Thevenot, and published in his collection of voyages, A. D. 1683.</P>
<P>THE second specimen of Mexican picture-writing, was published by Dr. Francis Gemelli Carreri, in two copperplates. The first is a map or representation of the progress of the ancient Mexicans on their first arrival in the country, and of the various stations in which they settled, before they founded the capital of their em∣pire in the lake of Mexico. The second is a Chronological Wheel, or Circle, representing the manner in which they computed and marked their cycle of fifty-two years. He received both from Don Carlos de Siguenza y Congorra, a diligent collector of an∣cient Mexican documents. But as it seems now to be a received opinion (founded, as far as I know on no good evidence) that Car∣reri was never out of Italy, and that his famous <HI>Giro del Mundo</HI> is an account of a fictitious voyage, I have not mentioned these paintings in the text. They have, however, manifestly the appear∣ance of being Mexican productions and are allowed to be so by Boturini, who was well qualified to determine whether they were genuine or suppositious. M. Clavigero, likewise, ad∣mits them to be genuine paintings of the ancient Mexicans. To me they always appeared to be so, though, from my de∣sire to rest no part of my narrative upon questionable autho∣rity, I did not refer to them. The style of painting in the former is considerably more perfect than any other specimen of Mexican design; but as the original is said to have been much defaced by time, I suspect that it has been improved by some touches from the hand of an European artist. Carreri, Churchill, iv. p. 487. The chronological wheel is a just delinea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ion of the Mexican mode of computing time, as described by Acosta, lib. vi. c. 2. It seems to resemble one which that lear∣ned Jesuit had seen; and if it be admitted as a genuine monument, it proves that the Mexicans had artificia or arbitrary characters, which represented several things besides numbers. Each month is there represented by a symbol expressive of some work or rite peculiar to it.</P>
<P>THE third specimen of Mexican painting was discovered by another Italian. In 1736, Lorenzo Boturini Benaduci set out for New Spain, and was<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed by several incidents to study the lan∣guage of the Mexicans, and to collect the remains of their histo∣rical monuments. He persisted nine years in his researches, with the enthusiasm of a projector, and the patience of an antiquary. In 1746, he published at Madrid. <HI>Idea de una Nueva Historia General de la America Septentrianal,</HI> containing an account of the
<PB N="475" REF="034476_0980_0FFDDE3704E0B7E0"/>
result of his inquiries; and he added to it a catalogue of his A∣merican Historical Museum, arranged under thirty six different heads. His idea of a New History appears to me the work of a whimsical credulous man. But his catalogue of Mexican maps, paintings, tributerols, calendars, &amp;c. is much larger than one could have expected. Unfortunately a ship, in which he had sent a considerable part of them to Europe, was taken by an English privateer during the war between Great Britain and Spain which commenced in the year 1739; and it is probable that they perish∣ed by falling into the hands of ignorant captors Boturini himself incurred the displeasure of the Spanish court, and died in an hos∣pital at Madrid. The history, of which the <HI>Idea,</HI> &amp;c. was only a <HI>prospectus,</HI> was never published. The remainder of his Museum seems to have been dispersed. Some part of it came into the possession of the present archbishop of Toledo, when he was pri∣mate of New Spain, and he published from it that curious tribute-roll which I have mentioned.</P>
<P>THE only other collection of Mexican paintings, as far as I can learn, is in the Imperial Library at Vienna. By order of their Imperial Majesties, I have obtained such a specimen of these as I desired, in eight paintings, made with so much fidelity, that I am informed the copies could hardly be distinguished from the ori∣ginals. According to a note in this <HI>Codex Mexicanus,</HI> it appears to have been a present from Emmanuel King of Portugal to Pope Clement VII. who died A. D. 1533. After passing through the hands of several illustrious proprietors, it fell into those of the cardinal of Saxe-Eifenach, who presented it to the emperor Leo∣pold. These paintings are manifestly Mexican, but they are in a style very different from any of the former. An engraving has been made of one of them, in order to gratify such of my readers as may deem this an object worthy their attention. Were it an object of sufficient importance, it might, perhaps, be possible, by recourse to the plates of Purchas, and the archbishop of Toledo, as a key, to form plausible conjectures concerning the meaning of this picture. Many of the figures are evidently similar. A. A. are targets and darts, almost in the same form with those published by Purchas, p. 1070, 1071, &amp;c. B. B. are figures of temples, nearly resembling those in Purchas, p. 1109 and 1113. and in Lorenzana, Plate II. C. is a bale of mantles, or cotton cloths, the figure of which occurs in almost every Plate of Purchas and Lorenzana. E. E. E. seems to be Mexican captains in their war dress, the fantastic ornaments of which resemble the figures in Purchas, p. 1110, 1111, 2113. I should suppose this picture to be a tribute-roll, as their mode of noting numbers occurs fre∣quently. D. D. D. &amp;c. According to Boturini, the mode of computation by the number of knots, was known to the Mexicans
<PB N="476" REF="034476_0981_0FFDDE38BA704FD8"/>
as well as to the Peruvians, p. 85. and the manner in which the number of units is represented in the Mexican paintings in my pos∣session, seems to confirm this opinion. They plainly resemble a string of knots on a cord or slender rope.</P>
<P>SINCE I published the former Edition, Mr. Waddilove, who is still pleased to continue his friendly attention to procure me in∣formation, has discovered, in the Library of the Escurial, a vo∣lume in folio, consisting of forty sheets of a kind of pasteboard, each the size of a common sheet of writing paper, with great va∣riety of uncouth and whimsical figures of Mexican painting, in very fresh colours, and with an explanation in Spanish to most of them. The first twenty-two sheets are the signs of the months, days, &amp;c. About the middle of each sheet are two or more large, figures for the month, surrounded by the signs of the days. The last eighteen sheets are not so filled with figures. They seem to be signs of Deities, and images of various objects. According to this Calendar in the Escurial, the Mexican year contained 286 days, divided into 22 months of 13 days. Each day is repre∣sented by a different sign, taken from some natural object, a ser∣pent, a dog, a lizard, a reed, a house, &amp;c. The signs of the days in the Calendar of the Escurial are precisely the same with those mentioned by Boturini, Idea, &amp;c. p. 45. But, if we may give credit to that Author, the Mexican year contained 360 days, divided into 18 months of 20 days. The order of days in every month was computed, according to him, first by what he calls a <HI>tridecennary</HI> progression of days from one to thirteen, in the same manner as in the Calendar of the Escurial, and then by a <HI>septe∣nary</HI> progression of days from one to seven, making in all twenty. In this Calendar, not only the signs which distinguish each day, but the qualities supposed to be peculiar to each month, are marked. There are certain weaknesses which seem to accompany the human mind through every stage of its progress in observation and science. Slender as was the knowledge of the Mexicans in Astronomy, it appears to have been already connected with judicial Astrology. The fortune and character of persons born in each month, are supposed to be decided by some superior influence predominant at the time of nativity. Hence it is foretold in the Calendar, that all who are born in one month will be rich, in another warlike, in a third luxurious, &amp;c. The pasteboard or whatever substance it may be on which the Calendar in the Escurial is painted, seems, by Mr. Waddilove's description of it, to resemble nearly that in the Imperial Library at Vienna. In several particulars, the figures bear some likeness to those in the plate which I have published. The figures marked D. which induced me to conjecture, that this painting might be a tribute-roll similar to these published by Pur∣chas and the Archbishop of Toledo, Mr. Waddilove supposes to
<PB N="477" REF="034476_0982_0FFDDE3C64D7ABD0"/>
be signs of days; and I have such confidence in the accuracy of his observations, as to conclude his opinion to be well founded. It appears from the characters in which the explanations of the figures are written, that this curious monument of Mexican art has been obtained, soon after the conquest of the empire. It is singular that it should never have been mentioned by any Spanish Author.</P>

<P>I AM informed by a person who resided long in New Spain, and visited almost every province of it, that there is not, in all the extent of that vast empire, any monument, nor vestige of any building more ancient than the conquest, nor of any bridge or highway, except some remains of the causeway from Guada∣loupe to that gate of Mexico by which Cortes entered the city. MS. <HI>penes me.</HI> The author of another account in manuscript observes, "That at this day there does not remain even the smallest vestige of the existence of any ancient Indian building public or private, either in Mexico or in any province of New Spain. I have travelled, says he, through all the countries adja∣cent to them, viz. New Galicia, New Biscay, New Mexico, Sonora, Cinaloa, the New Kingdom of Leon, and New San∣tandero, without having observed any monument worth notice, except some ruins near an ancient village in the valley <HI>de Cas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Grandes,</HI> in lat.

W. from Mexico" He describes these ruins minutely, and they appear to be the remains of a paltry building of turf and stone, plastered over with white earth or lime. A missionary informed that gentleman, that he had dis∣covered the ruins of another edifice similar to the former, about an hundred leagues towards N. W. on the banks of the River St. Pedro. MS. <HI>penes me.</HI></P>
<P>THESE testimonies derive great credit from one circumstance, that they were not given in support of any particular system or theory, but as simple answers to queries which I had proposed It is probable, however, that when these gentlemen assert, that no ruins or monuments of any ancient work whatever are now to be discovered in the Mexican Empire, they meant that there were no such ruins or monuments as conveyed an idea of grandeur or magnificence, in the works of its ancient inhabitants. For it ap∣pears from the testimony of several Spanish authors, that in Otumba, Tlascala, Cholula, &amp;c. some vestiges of ancient build∣ings are still visible. Villa Segnor Theatro Amer. p. 143. 308. 353. D. Fran. Ant. Lorenzana, formerly archbishop of Mexica, and now of Toledo, in his introduction to that edition of the Cartas de Relacion of Cortes, which he pub∣lished at Mexico, mentions some ruins which are still visible in several of the towns through which Cortes passed in his way to the capital, p. 4, &amp;c. But neither of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se authors give any description of them, and they seem to be so very in∣considerable, as to shew only that some buildings had once

been there. The large mount of earth at Cholula, which the Spaniards dignified with the name of temple, still remains, but without any steps by which to ascend, or any facing of stone. It appears now like a natural mount, covered with grass and shrubs, and possibly it was never any thing more. Torquem. lib. iii. c. 19. I have received a minute description of the re∣mains of a temple near Cuernavaca, on the road from Mexi∣co to Acapulco. It is composed of large stones, sitted to each other as nicely as those in the buildings of the Peruvians, which are hereafter mentioned. At the foundation it forms a square of 25 yards; but as it rises in height, it diminishes in ex∣tent, not gradually, but by being contracted suddenly at regu∣lar distances, so that it must have resembled the figure B in the plate. It terminated, it is said, in a spire.</P>

<P>THE exaggeration of the Spanish historians, with respect to the number of human victims sacrificed in Mexico, appears to be very great. According to Gomara, there was no year in which twenty thousand human victims were not offered to the Mexican Divinities, and in some years they amounted to fifty thousand. Cron. c. 229. The skulls of those unhappy persons were ranged in order in a building erected for that purpose, and two of Cortes's officers, who had counted them, informed Gomara that their number was an hundred and thirty-six thou∣sand. Ibid. c. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>2. Herrera's account is still more incredible, that the number of victims was so great, that five thousand have been sacrificed in one day, nay, on some occasions, no less than twenty thousand. Dec. iii. lib. ii. c. 16. Torquemada goes beyond both in extravagance, for he asserts, that twenty thousand children, exclusive of other victims, were slaughtered annually. Mon. Ind. lib. 21, ii. c. 16. The most respectable authority in favour of such high numbers is that of Zumuriaga, the first bishop of Mexico, who in a letter to the chapter general of his order, A. D. 1631, asserts that the Mexicans sacrificed annually twenty thousand victims. Davila Teatro Eccles. 126. In opposition to all these accounts, B. de las Casas observes, that if there had been such an annual waste of the human species, the country could never have arrived at that degree of populousness, for which it was remarkable when the Spaniards first landed there. This reasoning is just. If the number of victims in all the pro∣vinces of New Spain had been so great, not only must population have been prevented from increasing, but the human race must have been exterminated in a short time. For besides the waste
<PB N="480" REF="034476_0985_0FFDDE4452509D28"/>
of the species by such numerous sacrifices, it is observable that wherever the fate of captives taken in war is either certain death or perpetual slavery, as men can gain nothing by submitting speedily to an enemy, they always resist to the uttermost, and war becomes bloody and destructive to the last degree. Las Casas positively asserts, that the Mexicans never sacrificed more than fifty or a hundred persons in a year. See his dispute with Sepulveda, subjoined to his Brevissima Relacion, p. 105. Cor∣tes does not specify what number of victims was sacrificed an∣nually, but B. Diaz del Castello relates, that an inquiry hav∣ing been made, with respect to this, by the Franciscan Monks, who were sent into New Spain immediately after the conquest, it was found that about two thousand five hundred were sacri∣ficed every year in Mexico.

<P>IT is hardly necessary to observe, that the Peruvian Chronology is not only obscure, but repugnant to conclusion deduced from the most accurate and extensive observations, concerning the time that elapses during each reign, in any given succession of princes. The medium has been found not to exceed twenty years. Ac∣cording to Acosta and Garcilasso de la Vega, Huana Capac, who died about the year 1527, was the twelfth Inca. According to this rule of computing, the duration of the Peruvian monarchy ought not to have been reckoned above two hundred and forty years; but they affirm that it had subsisted four hundred years. Acosta lib. vi. c. 19. Vega, lib. i. c. 9. By this account each reign is extended at a medium to thirty-three years, instead of twenty, the number ascertained by Sir Isaac Newton's observa∣tions; but so imperfect were the Peruvian traditions, that though the total is boldly marked, the number of years in each reign is unknown.</P>

<P>THE temple of Cayambo, the palace of the Inca at Callo in the plain of Lacatunga, and that of Atun-Cannar, are described by Ulloa, tom i. 286, &amp;c. who inspected them with great care. M. de Condamine published a curious memoir concer∣ning the ruins of Atun-Cannar. Mem. de l'Academie de Berlin, A. D 1746, p. 435. Acosta describes the ruins of Cuzco, which he had examined. Lib. vi. c. 14. Garcilasso, in his usual stile, gives pompous and confused descriptions of several temples, and other public edifices. Lib. iii c. 1. c. 21. lib. vi. c. 4. Don — Zapata, in a large treatise concerning Peru, which has not hitherto been published, communicates some information with respect to several monuments of the ancient Peruvians, which have not been mentioned by other authors. MS. <HI>penes me,</HI> Ar∣ticulo xx. Ulloa describes some of the ancient Peruvian forti∣fications, which were likewise works of great extent and soli∣dity. Tom. i. 391. Three circumstances struck all those ob∣servers: the vast size of the stones which the Peruvians employed in some of their buildings. Acosta measured one, which was thirty feet long, eighteen broad, and six in thickness; and yet he adds, that in the fortress at Cuzco, there were stones considerably larger. It is difficult to conceive how the Peruvians could move these, and raise them to the height even of twelve feet. The se∣cond
<PB N="482" REF="034476_0987_0FFDDE4B58A1E880"/>
circumstance is, the imperfection of the Peruvian art, when applied to working in timber. By the patience and perseverance natural to Americans, stones may be formed into any shape, merely by rubbing one against another, or by the use of hatchets or other instruments made of stone; but with such rude tools, lit∣tle progress can be made in carpentry. The Peruvians could not mortize two beams together, or give any degree of union or sta∣bility to any work composed of timber. As they could not form a centre, they were totally unacquainted with the use of arches in building, nor can the Spanish authors conceive how they were able to frame a roof for those ample structures which they raised.</P>
<P>THE third circumstance is a striking proof, which all the monu∣ments of the Peruvians furnish, of their want of ingenuity and invention accompanied with patience no less astonishing. None of the stones employed in those works were formed into any par∣ticular or uniform shape, which could render them sit for being compacted together in building. The Indians took them as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ell from the mountains, or were raised out of the quarries. Some were square, some triangular, some convex, s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me concave. Their art and industry were employed in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ining them together, by form∣ing such hollows in the one, as perfectly corresponded to the pro∣jections or risings in the other. This tedious operation, which might have been so easily abridged, by adapting the surface of the stones to each other, either by rubbing, or by their hatchets of copper, would be deemed incred<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ble, if it were not put beyond doubt by inspecting the remains of those buildings. It gives them a very singular appearance to an European eye. There is no regular layer or str<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tum of building, and no one stone resembles another in di∣mensions or form. At the same time, by the persevering, but ill∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> industry of the Indians, they are all joined with that mi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e nicety which I have mentioned. Ulloa made this observa∣tion concerning the form of the stones in the fortress of Atun-Can∣nar. Voy. i. p. 387.

<P>P. Torribio de Benevente, or Motolinea, has enumerated ten causes of the rapid depopulation of Mexico, to which he gives the name of the Ten Plagues. Many of these are not peculiar to that province. 1. The introduction of the small-pox. This d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scase was first brought into New Spain in the year 1520, by a negro slave who attended Narvaez in his expedition against Cortes. Torribio affirms, that one half of the people in the provin∣ces visited with this distemper, died. To this mortality occasioned by the small-pox, Torquemada adds the destructive effects of two contageous distempers which raged in the years 1545 and 1576. In the former 800,000, in the latter above two millions perished, according to an exact account taken by order of the viceroys. Mon. Ind. i. 642. The small-pox was not introduced into Peru for several years after the invasion of the Spaniards, but there too that distemper proved very fatal to the natives. Garcia Origen, p. 88. 2. The number who were killed or died of famine in the war with the Spaniards, particularly during the siege of Mexico. 3. The great famine that followed after the reduction of Mexico, as all the people engaged, either on one side or other, had neglected the cultivation of their lands. Something similar to this happened in all the other countries conquered by the Spaniards. 4. The grievous tasks imposed by the Spaniards upon the people belonging to their Repartimientos. 5. The oppressive burden of taxes which they were unable to pay, and from which they could hope for no exemption. 6. The numbers employed in collecting the gold, carried down by the torrents from the mountains, who were forced from their own habitations, without any provision made for their subsistence, and subjected to all the rigour of cold in those elevated regions. 7. The immense labour of rebuilding Mexico, which Cortes urged on with such precipitate ardour, as destroyed an incredible num∣ber of people. 8. The number of people condemned to servitude, under various pretexts, and employed in working the silver mines. These marked by each proprietor with a hot iron, like his cattle, were driven in herds to the mountains. The na∣ture of the labour to which they were subjected there, the noxi∣ous vapours of the mines, the coldness of the climate, and scarcity of food, were so fatal, that Torribio affirms, the coun∣try
<PB N="485" REF="034476_0990_0FFDDE5277B49AD8"/>
round several of those mines, particularly near Guaxago, was covered with dead bodies, the air corrupted with their stench, and so many vultures, and other voracious birds, ho∣vered about for their prey, that the sun was darkened with their flight. 10. The Spaniards, in the different expeditions which they undertook, and by the civil wars which they carried on, destroyed many of the natives whom they compelled to serve them as <HI>Tamemes,</HI> or carriers of burdens. This last mode of oppression was particulary ruinous to the Peruvians. From the number of Indians who perished in Gonzalo Pizarro's expedi∣tion into the countries to the east of the Andes, one may form some idea of what they suffered in similar services, and how fast they were wasted by them. Torribio, MS. Corrita in his Breve y Summaria Relacion, illustrates and confirms several of Torribio's observations, to which he refers. MS. <HI>penes me.</HI></P>

<P>IT is very difficult to obtain an accurate account of the state of population in those kingdoms of Europe where the police is most perfect, and where science has made the greatest progress. In Spanish America, where knowledge is still in its infancy, and few men have leisure to engage in researches merely speculative, little attention has been paid to this curious inquiry. But in the year 1741, Philip V. enjoined the viceroys and governors of the several provinces in America, to make an actual survey of the people under their jurisdiction, and to transmit a report concerning their number and occupations. In consequence of this order, the Conde de Fuen-Clara, viceroy of New Spain, appointed D. Jos. Antonio de Villa Segnor y Sanchez, to execute that com∣mission in New Spain. From the reports of the magistrates in the several districts, as well as from his own observations, and
<PB N="487" REF="034476_0992_0FFDDE58C7A9CAC0"/>
long acquaintance with most of the provinces, Villa Segnor pub∣lished the result of his inquiries in his <HI>Teatro Americano.</HI> His report, however, is imperfect. Of the nine dioceses, into which the Mexican empire has been divided, he has published an account of five only, viz. the archbishopric of Mexico, the bishoprics of Pu∣ebla de los Angeles, Mechoacan, Oaxaca, and Nova Galicia. The bishoprics of Yucatan, Verapaz, Chiapa, and Guatimala, are entirely omitted, though the two latter comprehend countries in which the Indian race is more numerous than in any part of New Spain. In his survey of the extensive diocese of Nova Galicia, the situation of the different Indian villages is described, but he specifies the number of people only in a small part of it. The Indians of that extensive province, in which the Spanish domi∣nion is imperfectly established, are not registered with the same accuracy as in other parts of New Spain. According to Villa Segnor, the actual state of population in the five dioceses above mentioned is of Spanish negroes, mulattoes, and mestizos, in the dioceses of <TABLE>

We may rely with greater certainty on this computation of the number of Indians, as it is taken from the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ricule,</HI> or register, according to which the tribute paid by them is collected As four dia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ses of nine are totally omitted, and in that of Nova Galicia the numbers are imperfectly recorded, we may conclude, that the number of Indians in the Mexican empire exceeds two millions.</P>
<P>THE account of the number of Spaniards, &amp;c. seems not to be equally complete. Of many places, Villa Segnor observes in general terms, that several Spaniards, negroes, and people of a
<PB N="488" REF="034476_0993_0FFDDE5B66374B70"/>
mixed race, reside there, without specifying their number. If, therefore, we make allowance for these, and for all who reside in the four dioceses omitted, the number of Spaniards, and of those of a mixed race, may probably amount to a million and a half. In some places, Villa Segnor distinguishes between Spaniards and the three inferior races of negroes, mulattoes, and mestizos, and marks their number separately. But he generally blends them to∣gether. But from the proportion observable in those places, where the number ot each is marked, as well as from the account of the state of population in New Spain by other authors, it is manifest that the number of negroes and persons of a mixed race far ex∣ceeds that of Spaniards. Perhaps the latter ought not to be reckoned above 500,000 to a million of the former.</P>
<P>DEFECTIVE as this account may be, I have not been able to procure such intelligence concerning the number of people in Peru, as might enable me to form any con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecture equally satisfying with respect to the degree of its population. I have been in∣formed, that in the year 1761, the protectors of the Indians in the viceroyalty of Peru computed that 612,780 paid tribute to the king. As all females, and persons under age, are exempted from this tax in Peru, the total number of Indians ought by that account, to be 2,449,120. MS. <HI>penes me.</HI></P>
<P>I SHALL mention another mode, by which one may compute, or at least form a guess, concerning the state of population in New Spain and Peru. According to an account which I have reason to consider as accurate, the number or copies of the bull of Cruzada, exported to Peru on each new publication, is 1,171,953; to New Spain 2,649,326. I am informed, that but few Indians purchase bulls, and that they are sold chiefly to the Spanish inhabitants, and those of mixed race, so that the num∣ber of Spaniards, and people of a mixed race, will amount by this mode of computation, to at least three million.</P>
<P>THE number of inhabitants in many of the towns in Spanish America, may give us some idea of the extent of population, and correct the inaccurate, but popular notion entertained in Great Britain, concerning the weak and desolate state of their colo∣nies. The city of Mexico contains at least 150,000 people It is remarkable that Torquemada, who wrote his <HI>Monarquia Indiana</HI> about the year 1612, reckons the inhabitants of Mexico at that time to be only 7000 Spaniards, and 8000 Indians. Lib. iii. c. 26. Pueblade los Angeles contains above 60,000 Spaniards, and people of a mixed race. Villa Segnor, p. 247. Guadalaxara contains above 30,000, exclusive of Indians, Id. ii. 206. Lima con∣tains 54,000. D. Cosme Bueno Deser, de Peru, 1764. Car∣thagena contains 25,000. Potosi contains 25,000. Bueno, 1767. Popayan contains above 20,000. Ulloa, i. 287. Towns
<PB N="489" REF="034476_0994_0FFDDE5E1DE4F058"/>
of a second class are still more numerous. The cities in the most thriving settlements of other European nations in America can∣not be compared with these.</P>
<P>SUCH are the detached accounts of the number of people in several towns, which I found scattered in authors whom I thought worthy of credit. But I have obtained an enumeration of the inhabitants of the towns in the province of Quito, on the ac∣curacy of which I can rely; and I communicate it to the Public, both to gratify curiosity, and to rectify the mistaken notion which I have mentioned. St. Francisco de Quito contains between 50 and 60,000 people of all the different races. Besides the city, there are in the <HI>Corregimiento</HI> 29 <HI>curas</HI> or parishes established in the prin∣cipal villages, each of which has smaller hamlets depending upon it. The inhabitants of these are mostly Indians and Mestizos. St. Juan de Pasto has between 6 and 8000 inhabitants, besides 27 dependent villages. St. Miguel de Ibarra 7000 citizens, and ten villages. The district of Havala between 18 and 20,000 people. The district of Tacunna between 10 and 12,000. The district of Ambato between 8 and 10,000, besides 16 de∣pending villages. The city of Riobamba between 16 and 20,000 inhabitants, and 9 depending villages. The district of Chimbo between 6 and 8000. The city of Guyaquil from 6 to 20,000 inhabitants, and 14 depending villages. The district of Atuasi between 5 and 6000, and 4 depending villages. The city of Cuenza between 25 and 30,000 inhabitants, and 9 populous depending villages. The town of Laxa from 8 to 10,000 inhabi∣tants and 14 depending villages. This degree or population, though slender, if we consider the vast extent of the country, is far beyond what is commonly supposed. I have omitted to mention, in its proper place, that Quito is the only province in Spanish America that can be denominated a manufacturing coun∣try; hats, cotton stuffs, and coarse woollen cloths, are made there in such quantities, as to be sufficient not only for the consump∣tion of the province, but to furnish a considerable article for exportation into other parts of Spanish America. I know not whether the uncommon industry of this province should be consi∣dered as the cause or the effect of its populousness. But among the ostentatious inhabitants of the New World, the passion for every thing Out comes from Europe is so violent, that I am infor∣med the manufactures of Quito are so much undervalued, as to be on the decline.</P>

<P>THERE is no law that excludes Creoles from offices either civil or ecclesiastic.

But notwithstanding such repeated re∣commendations, preferment in almost every line is conferred on native Spaniards. A remarkable proof of this is produced by the author last quoted. From the discovery of America to the year 1637, three hundred and sixty-nine bishops, or archbishops, have been appointed to the different dioceses in that country, and of all that number only twelve were Creoles, p. 40. This predilection for Europeans seems still to continue.

But his opinion con∣cerning the wholesomeness of this occupation is contrary to the ex∣perience of all ages; and wherever men are allured by high wa∣ges, they will engage in any species of labour, however fatiguing or pernicious it may be. D. Hern. Carillo Altemirano relates a curious fact incompatible with this opinion. Wherever mines are wrought, says he, the number of Indians decreases; but in the province of Campeachy, where there are no mines, the num∣ber of Indians has increased more than a third since the conquest of America, though neither the soil nor climate be so favourable as in Peru or Mexico. Colbert Collect. In another memorial, presented to Philip III. in the year 1609, Captain Juan Gonza∣lez de Azevedo asserts, that in every district of Peru, where the Indians are compelled to labour in the mines, their numbers were reduced to the half, and in some places to the third, of what it was under the viceroyalty of Don Fran.

<P>THE strongest proof of this may be deduced from the laws themselves. By the multitude and variety of re∣gulations to prevent abuses, we may form an idea of the number
<PB N="493" REF="034476_0998_0FFDC55A6374B0D0"/>
of abuses that prevail. Though the laws have, wisely, provided that no Indian shall be obliged to serve in any mine at a greater distance from his place of residence than thirty miles; we are in∣formed in a memorial of D. Hernan Carillo Altamirano pre∣sented to the king, that the Indians of Peru are often compelled to serve in mines at the distance of a hundred, a hundred and fifty, and even two hundred leagues from their habitations. Col∣bert Collect. Many mines are situated in parts of the country, so barren, and so distant from the ordinary habitations of the Indi∣ans, that the necessity of procuring labourers to work there, has obliged the Spanish monarchs to dispense with their own regula∣tions in several instances, and to permit the viceroys to compel the people of more remote provinces to resort to those mines. Esca∣lona Gazophyl. Perub. lib. i. c. 16. But in justice to them it should be observed, that they have been studious to alleviate this oppression as much as possible, by enjoining the viceroys to em∣ploy every method, in order to induce the Indians to settle in some part of the country adjacent to the mines.

<P>THIS description of the manners of the Spanish clergy, I should not have ventured to give upon the testimony of protestant authors alone, as they may be suspected of pre∣judice or exaggeration. Gage, in particular, who had a better opportunity than any protestant, to view the interior state of Spanish America, describes the corruption of the church which he had forsaken, with so much of the acrimony of a new con∣vert, that I should have distrusted his evidence, though it com∣municates some very curious and striking facts. But Benzoni mentions the profligacy of ecclesiastics in America at a very early period after their settlement there. Hist. lib. ii. c 19, 20. M. Frezier, an intelligent observer, and zealous for his own religion, paints the dissolute manners of the Spanish ecclesiastics in Peru, particularly the regulars, in stronger colours than I have employed. Voy. p. 51. 215, &amp;c. M. Gentil confirms this account, Voy. i. 34. Correal concurs with both, and adds many remarkable circumstances. Voy. i. 61.155.161. I have good reason to believe, that the manners of the regular clergy, particularly in Peru, are still extremely indecent. Acosta himself acknowledges that great corruption of manners had been the consequence of permitting monks to forsake the retire∣ment and discipline of the cloister, and to mingle again with the world by undertaking the charge of the Indian parishes. De procur. Ind. Salute, lib. iv. c. 13, &amp;c. He mentions parti∣cularly those vices, of which I have taken notice, and consi∣ders
<PB N="495" REF="034476_1000_0FFDDE6F82DD9CB0"/>
the temptations to them as so formidable, that he leans to the opinion of those who hold that the regular clergy should not be em∣ployed as parish priests. Lib. v. c. 20. Even the advocates for the regulars admit, that many and great enormities abounded among the monks of different orders, when set free from the restraint of monastic discipline; and from the tone of their defence, one may conclude that the charge brought against them was not destitute of truth. In the French colonies, the state of the regular clergy is nearly the same as in the Spanish settlements, and the same consequences have followed. M. Biet, superi∣or of the secular priests in Cayenne, inquires with no less appearance of piety than of candour, into the causes of this corruption, and imputes it chiefly to the exemption of regulars from the jurisdiction and censures of their diocesans, to the temp∣tations to which they are exposed; and to their engaging in com∣merce. Voy. p. 320. It is remarkable that all the authors, who censure the licentiousness of the Spanish regulars with the greatest severity, concur in vindicating the conduct of the Jesuits. For∣med under a discipline more perfect than that of the other monastic orders, or animated by that concern for the honour of the society, which takes such full possession of every member of the order, the Jesuits, both in Mexico and Peru, it is allowed, maintained a most irreproachable decency of manners. Frezier, 223. Gentil, i. 34. The same praise is likewise due to the bishops and most of the dignified clergy. Frez. ibid.</P>
<P>A VOLUME of the Gazette de Mexico for the years 1728, 1729 1730, having been communicated to me, I find there a striking confirmation of what I have advanced concerning the spirit of low illiberal superstition prevalent in Spanish America. From the newspapers of any nation, one may learn what are the objects which chiefly engross its attention, and which appear to it most interesting. The Gazette of Mexico is filled almost entirely with accounts of religious functions, with descriptions of proces∣sions, consecrations of churches, beatifications of saints, festivals, autos de fe, &amp;c. Civil or commercial affairs, and even the transac∣tions of Europe occupy but a small corner in this magazine of monthly intelligence. From the titles of new books, which are regularly inserted in this Gazette, it appears that two-thirds of them are treatises of scholastic theology, or of monkish devotion.</P>

<P>NOT only the native Indians, but the <HI>Mestizos,</HI> or chil∣dren of a Spaniard and Indian, were originally ex∣cluded from the priesthood, and refused admission into any religious order. But by a law issued September 28th, 1588, Philip II. required the prelates of America to ordain such mestizos born in lawful wedlock, as they should find to be properly qualified, and to permit them to take the vows in any monastery where they had gone through a regular noviciate.

II. in the year 1697, he is∣sued a new edict enforcing the observation of it, and professing his desire to have all his subjects, Indians and mestizos, is well as Spa∣niards, admitted to the enjoyment of the same privileges. Such however, was the aversion of the Spaniards in America to the Indians, and their race, that this seems to have produced little ef∣fect; for, in the year 1725, Philip V. was obliged to renew the injunction in a more peremptory tone. But so unsummountable are the hatred and contempt of the Indians among the Peruvian Spa∣niards, that the present king has been constrained to enforce the former edicts anew by a law, published September 11, 1774.

<P>M. CLAVIGERO has contradicted what I have related concern∣ing the ecclesiastical state of the Indians, particularly their exclu∣sion from the sacrament of the Eucharist, and from holy orders, either as Seculars or Regulars, in such a manner as cannot fail to make a deep impression. He, from his own knowledge asserts, "that in New Spain not only are Indians permitted to partake of the sacrament of the altar, but that Indian priests are so nume∣rous that they may be counted by hundreds; and among these
<PB N="497" REF="034476_1002_0FFDDE75084F0F58"/>
have been many hundreds of rectors, canons, and doctors, and, as report goes, even a very learned bishop. At present, there are many pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sts, and not a few rectors, among whom there have been three or four our own pupils." Vol. II. 348, &amp;c. I owe it therefore as a duty to the public, as well as to myself, to con∣sider each of these points with care, and to explain the reasons which induced me to adopt the opinion which I have published.</P>
<P>I KNEW that in the Christian church there is no distinction of persons, but that men of every nation who embrace the religion of Jesus, are equally entitled to every Christian privilege which they are qualified to receive. I knew, likewise, that an opinion pre∣vailed, not only among most of the Spanish lairy settled in Ame∣rica, but among "many ecclesiastics, (I use the words of Her∣rera, dec. ii. lib. ii. c. 15.) that the Indians were not perfect or rational men, and were not possessed of such capacity as qualified them to partake of the sacrament of the altar, or of any other be∣nefit of our religion." It was against this opinion that Las Casas contended with the laudable zeal which I have described in Books III. and VI. But as the Bishop of Darien, Doctor Sepulvida, and other respectable ecclesiastics, vigorously supported the common opinion concerning the incapacity of the Indians, it became ne∣cessary, In order to determine the point, that the authority of the Holy See should be interposed; and accordingly Paul III. issued a ball A. D. 1537, in which, after condemning the opinion of those who held that the Indians, as being on a level with brute beasts, should be reduced to servitude, he declares, that they were really men, and as such were capable of embracing the Christian religion, and participating of all its blessings My account of this b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll, notwithstanding the cavils of M. Clavigero, must appear just to every person who takes the trouble of perusing it; and my account is the same with that adopted by Torquemada, lib. xvi. c. 25. and by Garcia, Orig. p. 311. But even after this decision, so low did the Spaniards resid<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ng in America rate the capacity of the natives, that the first council of Lima (I call it by that name on the authority of the best Spanish authors) discoun∣tenanced the admission of Indians to the holy communion. Tor∣quem. lib xvi. c. 20. In New Spain, the exclusion of Indians from the sacrament was still more explicit Ibid. After two centuries have elapsed, and notwithstanding all the improvement that the Indians may be supposed to have derived from their inter∣course with the Spaniards during that period, we are informed by D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>nt. Ulloa, that in Peru, where, as will appear in the sequel of this note, they are supposed to be better instructed than in New Spain, their ignorance is so prodigious that very few are permit∣ted to communicate, as being altogether destitute of the requisite capacity. Voy. I. 341, &amp;c. Solorz. Polit. Ind. I. 203.</P>
<P><PB N="498" REF="034476_1003_0FFDDE769B495618"/>WITH respect to the exclusion of Indians from the priesthood either as Seculars or Regulars, we may observe, that while it continued to be the common opinion that the natives of America, on account of their incapacity, should not be permitted to partake of the holy sacrament, we cannot suppose that they would be clothed with that sacred character which entitled them to conse∣crate and to dispense it. When Torquemada composed his <HI>Mo∣narquia Indiana,</HI> it was almost a century after the conquest of New Spain; and yet in his time, it was still the general practice to exclude Indians from holy orders. Of this we have the most satisfying evidence. Torquemada having celebrated the virtues and graces of the Indians at great length, and with all the com∣placency of a missionary, he starts as an objection to what he had asserted, "If the Indians really possess al<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the excellent qualities which you have described, why are they not permitted to assume the religious habit? Why are they not ordained priests and bishops as the Jewish and Gentile converts were in the primitive church, especially as they might be employed with such superior advantage, to other persons in the instruction of their countrymen?" Lib. xvii. c. 13.</P>
<P>IN answer to this objection, which establishes in the most unequivocal manner, what was the general practice at that period, Torquemada observes, that although by their natural disposition, the Indians are well fitted for a subordinate situation, they are destitute of all the qualities requisite in any station of dignity and authority; and that they are in general so addicted to drunkenness, that, upon the slightest temptation, one cannot promise on their behaving with the decency suitable to the clerical character. The propriety of excluding them from it, on these accounts, was, he observed, so well justified by experience, that when a foreigner of great eru∣dition, who came from Spain, condemned the practice of the Mexican church, he was convinced of his mistake in a public dis∣putation with the learned and most religious Father D. Juan de Gaona, and his retractation is still extant. Torquemada, indeed, acknowledges, as M. Clavigero observes, with a degree of exultation, that, in his time, some Indians had been admitted into monasteries; but, with the art of a disputant, he forgets to mention that Torquemada specifies only two examples of this, and takes notice that in both instances those Indians had been admit∣ted by mistake. Relying upon the authority of Torquemada, with regard to New Spain, and of Ulloa with regard to Peru, and considering the humiliating depression of the Indians in all the Spanish settlements, I concluded that they were not admitted into the ecclesiastical order, which is held in the highest veneration all over the New World.</P>
<P>BUT when M. Clavigero, upon his own knowledge, asserted facts
<PB N="499" REF="034476_1004_0FFDDE7939D688A8"/>
so repugnant to the conclusion I had formed, I began to distrust it, and to wish for further information. In order to obtain this, I applied to a Spanish nobleman, high in office, and eminent for his abilities, who, on different occasions, has permitted me to have the honour and benefit of corresponding with him. I have been favoured with the following answer: "What you have written concerning the admission of Indians into holy orders, or into mo∣nasteries, in Book VIII. especially as it is explained and limited in Note LXXXVIII. of the quarto edition, is in general accurate, and conformable to the authorities which you quote. And al∣though the congregation of the council resolved and declared, Feb. 13, A. D. 1682, that the circumstance or being an Indian, a mulatto, or mestizo, did not disqualify any person from being admitted into holy orders, if he was possessed of what is required by the canons to entitle him to that privilege; this only proves such ordinations to be legal and valid, (of which Solorzano, and the Spanish lawyers and historians quoted by him, Pol. Ind. lib. ii. c. 29, were persuaded) but it neither proves the propriety of admitting Indians into holy orders, nor what was then the com∣mon practice with respect to this; but, on the contrary, it shews that there was some doubt concerning the ordaining of Indians, and some repugnance to it.</P>
<P>"SINCE that time, there have been some examples of admit∣ting Indians into holy orders. We have now at Madrid an aged priest, a native of Tlascala, His name is D. Juan Cerilo de Cstilla Aquihual catehutle, descended of a Cazique converted to Christianity soon after the conquest. He studied the ecclesiasti∣cal sciences in a seminary of Puebla de los Angeles. He was a candidate, nevertheless for ten years, and it required much in∣terest before Bishop Abren would consent to ordain him. This ecclesiastic is a man of unexceptionable character, modest, self-de∣nied, and with a competent knowledge of what relates to his clerical functions. He came to Madrid above thirty-four years ago, with the sole view of soliciting admission for the Indians into the colleges and seminaries in New Spain, that if, after being well instructed and tried, they should find an inclination to enter into the ecclesiastical state, they might embrace it, and perform its functions with the greatest benefit to their countrymen, whom they could address in their native tongue. He has obtained va∣rious regulations favourable to his scheme, particularly that the first college which became vacant in consequence of the exclusion of the Jesuits, should be set apart for this purpose. But neither these regulations, nor any similar ones inserted in the laws of the Indies, has produced any effect, on account of objections and re∣presentations from the greater part of persons of chief considera∣tion employed in New Spain. Whether their opposition be well
<PB N="500" REF="034476_1005_0FFDDEDEB16BE6B8"/>
founded or not, is a problem difficult to resolve, and towards the solution of which, several distinctions and modifications are re∣quisite.</P>
<P>"ACCORDING to the accounts of this ecclesiastic, and the in∣formation of other persons who have resided in the Spanish domi∣nions in America, you may rest assured that in the kingdom of Tierra Firme no such thing is known as either an Indian secular priest or monk; and that in New Spain there are very few ecclesi∣astics of Indian race. In Peru perhaps, the number may be greater, as in that country there are more Indians who possess the means of acquiring such a learned education as is necessary for persons who aspire to the clerical character."</P>

<P>WHEN the mines of Potosi were discovered in the year 1545, the veins were so near the surface, that the ore was easily extracted, and so rich that it was refined with little trou∣ble and at a small expence, merely by the action of fire. This simple mode of refining by fusion alone continued until the year 1574, when the use of mercury in refining silver, as well as gold, was discovered. Those mines having been wrought without in∣terruption for two centuries, the veins are now sunk so deep, that the expence of extracting the ore is greatly increased. Be∣sides this, the richness of the ore, contrary to what happens in most other mines, has become less, as the vein continued to dip. The vein has likewise diminished to such a degree, that one is amaz∣ed that the Spaniards should persist in working it. Other rich mines have been successively discovered, but in general the value of the ores has decreased so much, while the expence of extract∣ing them has augmented, that the court of Spain, in the year 1736,

<P>MANY remarkable proofs occur of the advanced state of industry in Spain, at the beginning of the sixteenth cen∣tury. The number of cities in Spain was considerable, and they were peopled far beyond the proportion that was common in other parts of Europe. The causes of this I have explained, Hist. of Cha. V. i. 158. Wherever cities are populous, that species of industry which is peculiar to them increases, artificers and manu∣facturers abound. The effect of the American trade in giving activity to these is manifest, from a singular fact. In the year 1545, while Spain continued to depend on its own industry, for the supply of its colonies, so much work was bespoke from the manufacturers, that it was supposed they could hardly finish it in less than six years. Campom. i. 406. Such a demand must have put much industry in motion, and have excited extraordinary ef∣forts. Accordingly, we are informed, that in the beginning of Philip II.'s reign, the city of Seville alone, where the trade with America centered, gave employment to no fewer than 16,000 looms in silk or woolen work, and that above 130,000 persons had occupation in carrying on these manufactures. Campom. ii. 472. But so rapid and pernicious was the operation of the causes which I shall enumerate, that before Philip III. ended his reign, the looms in Seville were reduced to 400. Uztariz, c. 7.</P>
<P><PB N="502" REF="034476_1007_0FFDDE7C1B515CC8"/>SINCE the publication of the first edition, I have the satisfac∣tion to find my ideas concerning the early commercial intercourse between Spain and her colonies confirmed and illustrated by D. Bernardo Ward, of the Junta de Comercio at Madrid, in his <HI>Proyecto Economico,</HI> Part. ii. c. i. "Under the reigns of Char∣les V. and Philip II." says he, "the manufactures of Spain and of the Low Countries subject to her dominion, were in a most flourishing state. Those of France and England were in their infancy. The republic of the U. Provinces did not then exist. No European power but Spain, had colonies of any value in the New World. Spain could supply her settlements there with the productions of her own soil, the fabrics wrought by the hands of her own artizans, and all she received in return for these belonged to herself alone. Then the exclusion of foreign manu∣factures was proper, because it might be rendered effectual. Then Spain might lay heavy duties upon goods exported to America, or imported from it, and might impose what restraint she deemed pro∣per upon a commerce entirely in her own hands. But when time and successive revolutions had occasioned an alteration in all those circumstances, when the manufactures of Spain began to decline, and the demands of America were supplied by foreign fabrics, the original maxims and regulations of Spain should have been ac∣commodated to the change in her situation. The policy that was wise at one period, became absurd in the other."</P>

The Spanish mer∣chants, with sentiments suitable to their usual integrity, sustained the whole loss, and indemnified the foreigners by whom they were employed.

<P>THE account of the mode in which the factors of the South Sea company conducted the trade in the fair of Porto-bello, which was opened to them by the Assiento, I have taken from Don Dion. Alcedo y Herrera, president of the court of Au∣dience in Quito, and governor of that province. Don Dionysio was a person of such respectable character for probity and dis∣cernment, that his testimony, in any point would be of much weight; but greater credit is due to it in this case, as he was an eye-witness of the transactions which he relates, and was often employed in detecting and authenticating the frauds which he des∣cribes. It is probable, however, that his representation, being com∣posed at the commencement or the war which broke out between Great Britain and Spain, in the year 1739, may, in some instances, discover a portion of the acrimonious spirit, natural at that junc∣ture. His detail of facts is curious; and even English authors confirm it in some degree, by admitting both that various frauds were practised in the transactions of the annual ship, and that the contraband trade from Jamaica, and other British colonies, was be∣come enormously great. But for the credit of the English na∣tion it may be observed, that those fraudulent operations are not to be considered as deeds of the company, but as the dishonour∣able arts of their factors and agents. The company itself sus∣tained a considerable loss by the Assiento trade. Many of its ser∣vants acquired immense fortunes. Anderson Chronol. deduct, ii. 388.</P>

<P>SEVERAL facts with respect to the institution, the progress, and the effects, of this company, are curious, and but little known to English readers. Though the province of Venezuela,
<PB N="504" REF="034476_1009_0FFDDE819BE6B728"/>
or Caraccas, extends four hundred miles along the coast, and is one of the most fertile in America; it was so much neglected by the Spaniards, that during the twenty years prior to the establish∣ment of the company, only five ships sailed from Spain to that pro∣vince; and during 16 years, from 1706 to 1722, not a single ship arrived from the Caraccas in Spain. Noticias de Real Com∣pania de Caraccas, p. 28. During this period Spain must have been supplied almost entirely with the large quantity of cacao, which it consumes, by foreigners. Before the erection of the company, neither tobacco nor hides were imported from Carac∣cas into Spain. Id. p. 117. Since the commercial operations of the company began in the year 1731, the importation of cacao into Spain has increased amazingly. During thirty years subse∣quent to 1701, the number of <HI>Fanegas</HI> of cacao (each a hundred and ten pounds) imported from Caraccas, was 643,215. Dur∣ing eighteen years subsequent to 1731, the number of <HI>Fanegas</HI> imported was 869,247; and if we suppose the importation to be continued in the same proportion during the remainder of thirty years, it will amount to 1,448,746 <HI>Fanegas,</HI> which is an increase of 805,531 <HI>Fanegas.</HI> Id. p. 148. During eight years subse∣quent to 1756, there has been imported into Spain by the com∣pany, 88,482 <HI>arrolas</HI> (each twenty-five pounds) of tobacco; and hides to the number of 177,354. Id. 161. Since the publica∣tion of the Noticias de Campania, in 1765, its trade seems to be on the increase. During five years subsequent to 1769, it has imported 179,156 <HI>Fanegas</HI> of cacao into Spain, 36,208 arrolas of tobacco, 75,496 hides, and 221,432 pesos in specie. Cam∣pomanes, ii. 162. The last article is a proof of the growing wealth of the colony. It receives cash from Mexico in return for the cacao, with which it supplies that province, and this it remits to Spain, or lays out in purchasing European goods. But, besides this, the most explicit evidence is produced, that the quantity of cacao raised in the province is double to what it yielded in 1731; the number of its live stock is more than treble, and its inhabitants much augmented. The revenue of the bishop, which arises wholly from tithes, has increased from eight to twenty thousand pesos. Notic. p. 69. In consequence of the augmenta∣tion of the quantity of cacao imported into Spain, its price has decreased from eighty pesos for the <HI>Fanega</HI> to forty. Id. 61.

In Porto-Rico, from 1,200 to 7,000. The total value of goods imported from Cuba into Spain, was reckoned, in 1774, to be 1,500,000 pesos. Educ. Popul. i. 450, &amp;c.</P>

Almost every point of importance with respect to interior police, taxation, agriculture, manufactures, and trade, do∣mestic as well as foreign, is examined in the course of these works; and there are not many authors, even in the nations most eminent for commercial knowledge, who have carried on their inquiries with a more thorough knowledge of those various subjects, and a

D. 1746, was accomptant-general in one of the most considerable departments of the royal revenue, and by that means had access to proper information, his testi∣mony with respect to this point merits great credit. No such accurate detail of the Spanish revenues in any part of America has hitherto been published in the English language, and the par∣ticulars of it may appear curious and interesting to some of my readers.</P>

Theat. Mex. vol. i. p. 38, &amp;c. According to Villa Segnor, the total produce of the Mexican mines amounts at a medium to eight millions of pesos in silver annually, and to 5,912 marks of gold. Ib. p. 44. Several branches of the revenue have been explained in the course of the history; some which there was no occasion of mentioning, require a particular illustration. The right to the <HI>rithes</HI> in the New World, is vested in the crown of Spain, by a bull of Alexander VI. Charles V. appointed them to be applied in the following manner: One fourth is allotted to the bishop of the diocese, another fourth to the dean and chapter, and other offi∣cers of the cathedral. The remaining half is divided into nine equal parts. Two of these, under the denomination of <HI>los dos Novenos reales,</HI> are paid to the crown, and constitute a branch of the royal revenue. The other seven parts are applied to the maintenance of the parochial clergy, the building and support of churches, and other pious uses. Recopil. lib. i. tit. xvi. Ley 23, &amp;c Avendano Thesaur.

<P>THE <HI>Averia,</HI> or tax paid on account of convoys to guard the ships sailing to and from America, was first imposed when Sir Francis Drake filled the New World with terror by his expedi∣tion to the South Sea.

<CELL>I HAVE not been able to procure any accurate detail of the se∣veral branches of revenue in Peru, later than the year 1614. From a curious manuscript, containing a state of that viceroyalty in all its departments, presented to the Marquis of Montes-Claros, by Fran. Lopez Caravantes, accomptant-general in the tribunal of Lima, it appears that the public revenue, as nearly as I can com∣pute

<P>BUT several articles appear to be omitted in this computation, such as the duty on stamped paper, leather, ecclesiastical annats, &amp;c. so that the revenue of Peru may be well supposed equal to that of Mexico.</P>
<P>IN computing the expence of government in New Spain, I may take that of Peru as a standard. There the annual establish∣ment for defraying the charge of administration, exceeds one half of the revenue collected, and there is no reason for supposing it to be less in New Spain.</P>
<P>I HAVE obtained a calculation of the total amount of the public revenue of Spain from America and the Philippines, which, as the reader will perceive from the two last articles, is more re∣cent than any of the former.</P>

<P>AN author, long conversant in commercial speculation, has computed, that from the mines of New Spain alone, the king receives annually, as his fifth, the sum of two millions of our money. Harris Collect. of Voy. ii. p. 164. According to this calculation, the total produce of the mines must be ten mil∣lions sterling; a sum so exorbitant, and so little corresponding with all accounts of the annual importation from America, that the information on which it is founded must evidently be errone∣ous. According to Campomanes, the total product of the Ame∣rican mines may be computed at thirty millions of pesos, which, at four shillings and sixpence a peso, amounts to 7,425,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> sterling, the king's fifth of which (if that were regularly paid) would be 1 485,000<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> But from this sum must be deducted what is lost by a fraudulent withholding of the fifth due to the crown, as well as the sum necessary for defraying the expence of administration.

<P>ACCORDING to Bern. de Ulloa, all foreign goods export∣ed from Spain to America pay duties of various kinds, amounting in all to more than 25 per cent. As most of the goods with which Spain supplies her colonies are foreign, such a tax upon a trade so extensive must yield a considerable revenue. Retablis. de Manuf. and du Commerce d'Esp. p. 150.

<P>THE Marquis de Serralvo, according to Gage, by a mono∣poly of salt, and by embarking deeply in the Manila trade as well as in that to Spain, gained annually a million of ducats. In one year he remitted a million of ducats to Spain, in order to purchase from the Conde Olivares, and his creatures, a prolonga∣tion of his government, p. 61. He was successful in his suit, and continued in office from 1624 to 1635, double the usual time.</P>
