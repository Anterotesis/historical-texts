<P>PERHAPS the following little Poem may be considered with the more indulgence by the Public, after it is known, that it was actually writ∣ten, at a period when the Army was in the field, and the Author so far engaged in the duties of his profession, as to have but little leisure for subjects of literature or amusement. And it will not be necessa∣ry to demonstrate to those who have the least know∣ledge of a military life, how unfavourable such a a state is to poetical contemplation. This, it is pre∣sumed, may pertinently be urged in excuse for the slighter errors, and inaccuracies of the performance; and the Design must in some measure atone, for any of a different complexion.</P>
<P>To inspire our Countrymen now in arms, or who may hereafter be called into the field, with perseve∣rance and fortitude, thro' every species of difficulty and danger, to continue their exertions for the de∣fence of their country, and the preservation of its Liberties, is the object of this Address.</P>
<P>For this purpose, it was imagined, no considerati∣ons could be more effectual, than the recollection of the past, and the anticipation of the future. For where is the man to be found, who, after all that has been done and suffered; after such a profusion of blood, and treasure has been expended; and such important advantages have been obtained; would basely relinquish, and leave unfinished the illustrious task of <HI>rearing</HI> an EMPIRE, which from its situation, and circumstances, must surpass all that ever have existed, in magnitude, felicity and duration?</P>
<P>Altho' the Author entertains the most sanguine expectations of the gratitude and liberality, with which the Continent will reward those who have li∣terally
<PB N="6" REF="016801_0004_0F9E79F9405382E8"/>
borne the heat and burden of the day of war; he has not insisted on those pecuniary or slighter considerations: but has attempted, to turn the at∣tention, to the future grandeur, happiness, and glory of the Country, for which we are now contending. —The lands already granted to the Army, first sug∣gested the idea of a military settlement on the Ohio, or in some of those Western regions; whose beauties can never be sufficiently displayed, much less exaggerated by description. The mild tempe∣rature and serenity of the air, the salubrity of the climate, the fertility of the soil, the luxuriance of its products, the extent of territory, and the amaz∣ing inland navigation, which those boundless lakes, and immeasurable rivers will open; cannot fail one day, to equal that garden of the world to the re∣presentation given of it, in the conclusion of the Poem. The possession of such a Country, (rescued from the hand of invasion) in a perfect state of free∣dom and security, will be a glorious compensation for all our toils and sufferings, and a monument of the most unparalell'd bravery and patriotism to the remotest posterity.—Stimulated with the love of glory, allured by these delightful prospects, and animated with the pleasing hope of the speedy fru∣ition of those rapturous scenes; there are thousands who have drawn the sword, with a resolution never to sheath it, until a happy period is put to the con∣test.—For himself, the Writer declares, that hav∣ing already devoted, whatever talents and abilities nature has conferred upon him, to the service of his Country; no efforts that can be made with his voice, his pen, or his sword, shall ever be wanting to confirm its LIBERTIES and INDEPENDENCE.</P>

<HEAD>An Address to the Army, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YE martial bands! Columbia's fairest pride!</L>
<L>To toils inured, in dangers often try'd;</L>
<L>Ye gallant Youths! whose breasts for glory burn,</L>
<L>Each <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> aim, and meaner passion spurn;</L>
<L>Ye who unmov'd, in the dread hour have stood,</L>
<L>And smil'd undaunted in the field of blood;</L>
<L>Who greatly dar'd, at Freedom's rapt'rous call</L>
<L>With her to triumph, or with her to fall:</L>
<L>Now brighter days in prospect swift ascend;</L>
<L>Ye sons of fame, the hallow'd theme attend!</L>
<L>The past review, the future scene explore,</L>
<L>And Heav'ns high King, with grateful hearts adore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What time proud Albion, thund'ring o'er the waves,</L>
<L>Frown'd on her sons, and bade them turn to slaves:</L>
<L>When lost to honor, virtue, glory, shame;</L>
<L>When nought remain'd of Britain, but the name.</L>
<L>The parent State—a parent now no more—</L>
<L>Let loose the hirelings of despotic pow'r,</L>
<L>Urg'd to keen vengeance their relentless ire,</L>
<L>And hop'd submission from their sword and fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As when dark clouds, from Andes' tow'ring head,</L>
<L>Roll down the skies, and round th' horizon spread,</L>
<L>With thunders fraught, the black'ning tempest fails,</L>
<L>And bursts tremendous o'er Peruvian vales:</L>
<L>So broke the storm, on Concord's fatal plain;</L>
<L>There fell our brothers, by fierce ruffians slain.</L>
<L>Inglorious deed! to wild despair then driven,</L>
<L>We suppliant made our great appeal to Heaven.</L>
<L>Then the shrill trumpet, echoed from afar,</L>
<L>And sudden blaz'd the wasting flame of war;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="016801_0006_0F9E79FA77267050"/>
<L>From State to State, swift flew the dire alarms,</L>
<L>And ardent Youths impetuous rush'd to Arms:</L>
<L>To Arms the matrons and the virgins sung,</L>
<L>To Arms their sires, their husbands, brothers sprung,</L>
<L>No dull delay—where'er the sound was heard,</L>
<L>Where the red standards in the air appear'd,</L>
<L>Or where the brazen cannon swell'd the roar,</L>
<L>From bleak Acadia to the Georgian shore.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now join'd the Crowd, from their far-distant farms,</L>
<L>In rustic guise, and unadorn'd in arms.</L>
<L>Not like their foes, in tinsel trappings gay,</L>
<L>And burnish'd arms that glitter'd on the day;</L>
<L>Who now advanc'd, where Charlestown rear'd its height,</L>
<L>In martial pomp, and claim'd the awful fight;</L>
<L>And proudly deem'd, with one decisive blow,</L>
<L>To hurl destruction on the routed foe—</L>
<L>Not so, just Heav'n had fix'd the great decree,</L>
<L>And bade the sons of freemen still be free;</L>
<L>Bade all their souls with patriot ardor burn,</L>
<L>And taught the finer charms of ease to spurn,</L>
<L>The threats of vengeance, and of death to brave,</L>
<L>To purchase freedom, or a glorious grave.</L>
<L>Long rag'd the contest on th' embattled field;</L>
<L>Nor those would fly, nor these would tamely yield;</L>
<L>'Till Warren fell, in all the boast of arms,</L>
<L>The pride of genius, and unrivall'd charms,</L>
<L>His Country's hope!—full soon the gloom was spread,</L>
<L>Oppress'd with numbers, and their leader dead;</L>
<L>Slow from the field the sullen troops retir'd,</L>
<L>Behind, the hostile flame to Heav'n aspir'd.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The imperious Britons, on the well-sought ground,</L>
<L>No cause for joy, or wanton triumph found;</L>
<L>But saw with grief their dreams of conquest vain,</L>
<L>Felt the deep wounds, and mourn'd their vet'rans slain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Nor less our woes—Now darkness gather'd round,</L>
<L>The thunder rumbled, and the tempest frown'd;</L>
<L>When lo! to guide us thro' the storm of war</L>
<L>Beam'd the bright splendor of Virginia's Star.</L>

<L>Oh first of hero's! fav'rite of the skies!</L>
<L>To these dread toils, thy country bade thee rise.</L>
<L>Oh born, beyond the lot of mortals brave!</L>
<L>Thine was the task, a sinking land to save.</L>
<L>For this, from thy lov'd scenes of rural life</L>
<L>Thou boldly plung'd amidst, th' unequal strife:</L>
<L>For this, hast tryed the mountain-weight of care,</L>
<L>The wintry blast, the summer's sultry air;</L>
<L>The autumnal gale, that taints th' infectious breath,</L>
<L>The hour of danger, and the field of death.—</L>
<L>Then the foe trembled, at the well known name,</L>
<L>And raptur'd thousands to his standard came;</L>
<L>His martial skill our rising armies form'd;</L>
<L>His patriot zeal their gen'rous bosoms warm'd,</L>
<L>His voice inspir'd, his god-like presence led,</L>
<L>The Britons saw, and from his presence fled.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But what avails to trace the sate of war,</L>
<L>Thro' iron fields, and point each honor'd scar;</L>
<L>Why should the strain your former woes recall</L>
<L>The tears that wept, a friend or brother's fall,</L>
<L>When by your side, first in the adventrous strife,</L>
<L>He dauntless rush'd, too prodigal of life.</L>
<L>Some future bard shall tempt the untry'd themes,</L>
<L>Sing how you dar'd, in fortune's worst extremes;</L>
<L>What cruel wrongs the indignant patriot bore,</L>
<L>What various ills your feeling bosoms tore,</L>
<L>What boding horrors gloom'd the dark'ning hour,</L>
<L>When British Legions arm'd with death-like pow'r,</L>
<L>Bade desolation mark their crimson'd way,</L>
<L>And lur'd the savage to his destin'd prey;</L>
<L>When fierce Germania her barbarians pour'd,</L>
<L>And rapine's sons with wasting fire and sword,</L>
<L>Spread death around—where'er your eyes ye turn'd,</L>
<L>Fled were the peasants—and the village burn'd—</L>
<L>How did your hearts for others suff'rings melt?</L>
<L>What tort'ring pangs your bleeding country felt?</L>
<L>What! when you fled before superior force,</L>
<L>Each succour lost, and perish'd each resource;</L>
<L><PB N="10" REF="016801_0008_0F9E79FCACDAC9C0"/>When nought was seen around, but prospects drear,</L>
<L>Th' insulting foe hung dreadful on your rear;</L>
<L>And boastful ween'd that day to close the scene,</L>
<L>And quench your name, as tho' it ne'er had been.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why Britain! rag'd thine insolence and scorn?</L>
<L>Why burst thy vengeance on the wretch forlorn?</L>
<L>The cheerless <HI>captive</HI> to slow death consign'd,</L>
<L>Chill'd with keen frost, in prison glooms confin'd;</L>
<L>Of hope bereft, by thy vile minions curs'd,</L>
<L>With hunger famish'd, and consum'd with thirst,</L>
<L>Without one friend,—when death's last horror stung.</L>
<L>Roll'd the wild eye, and gnaw'd the anguish'd tongue!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Why Britain! in thine arrogance and pride,</L>
<L>Didst thou Heav'ns violated laws deride,</L>
<L>Mock human mis'ry with contemptuous sneers,</L>
<L>And fill thy cup of guilt with orphan's tears!</L>
<L>The widows wailing, and the wretch's groan,</L>
<L>Rise in remembrance to th'eternal throne,</L>
<L>While the red flame, thro' the broad concave driv'n,</L>
<L>Calls down the vengeance of the insulted Heav'n.</L>

<L>To damp the ardor of the heav'n-born mind,</L>
<L>With haughty threats, to force the daring train,</L>
<L>To bow unnerv'd in slav'ry's galling chain;</L>
<L>Make countless freemen—then no longer free—</L>
<L>Shrink at thy frown, and bend the prostrate knee,</L>
<L>And couldst thou dream! then wake, dissolve thy charms.</L>
<L>Rous'd by their wrongs, see desp'rate hosts in arms▪</L>
<L>No fear dismays, nor danger's voice appalls,</L>
<L>While kindred blood for sacred vengeance calls;</L>
<L>Their swords shall triumph o'er thy vaunted force.</L>
<L>And curb the Conq'ror in his headlong course.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>What spoils of war thy sons, Columbia! claim'd,</L>
<L>What trophies rose! where thy red ensigns flam'd,</L>
<L>Where the great Chief, o'er Del'ware's icy wave,</L>
<L>Led the small band, in danger doubly brave,</L>
<L>On high designs—and e'er the dawning hour,</L>
<L>Germania's vet'rans own'd the victor's pow'r—</L>

<L>Oh gallant Mercer! deathless laurels bloom.—</L>

<L>The tide of slaughter stain'd the sanguine ground;</L>
<L>When the bold freemen gath'ring from afar</L>
<L>Foil'd the proud foe, and crush'd the savage war.</L>
<L>Nor less illustrious were those glorious names,</L>

<L>And pluck'd the standards from the vanquish'd walls▪</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet now ye Heroes! see what choice remains,</L>
<L>Ignoble bondage, and inglorious chains,</L>
<L>Or all the joys which liberty can give,</L>
<L>For which you dare to die, or wish to live.</L>
<L>On your own arms, your country's fate depends—</L>
<L>Your wives, your children, parents, brothers, friends,</L>

<L>But like the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> our great forefathers <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>red,</L>
<L>By freedom <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rtur'd, and by temp'rance <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed;</L>
<L>Healthful and strong, they turn'd the virg<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> soil,</L>
<L>Th' unta<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d forest bow'd beneath their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il:</L>
<L>At early dawn, they sought the mountain chace</L>
<L>Or <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Indian, from his lurking place;</L>
<L>Curb'd the mad fury, of those barb'rous men,</L>
<L>Or dragg'd the <HI>wild beast</HI> struggling from his den:</L>
<L>To all the vigour of that pristine race,</L>
<L>New charms are added, and superior grace.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then cities rise—and spiry towns increase,</L>
<L>With gilded domes, and every art of peace.</L>
<L>Then cultivation, shall extend his pow'r,</L>
<L>Rear the green blade and nurse the tender flow'r,</L>
<L>Make the fair villa, in full splendors smile,</L>
<L>And robe with verdure all the genial soil.</L>
<L>Then shall rich commerce, court the fav'ring gales,</L>
<L>And wond'ring wilds admire the passing sails.</L>
<L>Where the bold ships, the stormy Huron brave,</L>
<L>Where wild Ontario rolls the whitening wave,</L>
<L>Where fair Ohio, his pure current pours,</L>
<L>And Missisippi laves the extended shores.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then oh blest land! with genius unconfin'd,</L>
<L>With polish'd manners, and the illumin'd mind,</L>
<L>Thy future race, on daring wing shall soar,</L>
<L>Each science trace, and all the arts explore;</L>
<L>'Till bright religion, beck'ning from the skies,</L>
<L>Shall bid thy sons to endless glories rise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>As round thy clime, celestial joy extends,</L>
<L>Thy beauties ripen, and thy pomp ascends,</L>

<L>Where now the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, or tangled thicket grows,</L>
<L>The wilderness all blossom as the rose</L>
<L>Unbounded <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, unknown charms <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssume,</L>

<L>With <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> faith, and morals pure, their name</L>
