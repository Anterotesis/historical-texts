<HEAD>THE YEARLY VERSES Of the PRINTERS Lad, who carrieth a∣bout the <HI>Pennsylva∣nia GAZETTE,</HI> to the Customers thereof. <DATE>JANUARY 1. 1740.</DATE></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>BY annual Services Estates are held,</L>
<L>The Rent unpaid the Tenant is expell'd:</L>
<L>And I, subjected by my Tenure, pay</L>
<L>A new struck List of Rhymes on <HI>New-Year</HI>'s Day.</L>
<L>Sure, if I miss, to have an empty Purse,</L>
<L>And to displease my MASTER'S, which is worse,</L>
<L>But never was I puzzled heretofore,</L>
<L>So much the last Year's News to number o'er:</L>
<L>I'm out of Sorts, and know not what to write;</L>
<L>The War's begun with <HI>Spain.</HI>—but who will fight?</L>
<L>Unfitted for this Task, a Tale I'll tell,</L>
<L>In Hopes the Substitute may do as well.</L>
<L>Two loving Neighbours, but unlike in Sense;</L>
<L>(For one rely'd alone on Providence)</L>
<L>Resolv'd, the first, his Houshold to secure,</L>
<L>By Arms prepar'd, and Locks on ev'ry Door;</L>
<L>Th' other ne'er to be upon his Watch,</L>
<L>But 'gainst Temptations, and his Doors to latch,</L>
<L>To keep out Winds and Rain, or Dogs and Swine;</L>
<L>From Thieves defended by a Fence divine.</L>
<L>Oft' had these Neighbours been in deep Dispute,</L>
<L>But neither could the Other yet confute:</L>
<L>The first then thinking how with honest Guile</L>
<L>He could his Friend to Reason reconcile,</L>
<L>Goes in the Dead of Night, his Pewter takes,</L>
<L>And Prize of all his loose laid Treasure makes.</L>
<L>The Loser in the Morn perceives his Loss,</L>
<L>Reflects full sorely, on so great a Cross;</L>
<L>Refuses Meat, grows thin; his Looks are pale;</L>
<L>And loud he would, but durst not loud bewail:</L>
<L>His Neighbour saw, and pitying did restore</L>
<L>The Goods purloin'd, and bade him bolt his Door.</L>
<L>But he still thinking Providence was near,</L>
<L>That try'd his Faith by such a simple Fear,</L>
<L>Resolv'd more firmly to rely on him,</L>
<L>And more and more to merit his Esteem.</L>
<L>Not long, alas! he liv'd in this Resolve,</L>
<L>Seasons and Things in Motion quick revolve;</L>
<L>Thieves desp'rate, came within the Neighbourhood;</L>
<L>They try'd a House, and there the Bars withstood;</L>
<L>They came to this (and here a Latch was all)</L>
<L>An Entrance gain'd to Kitchen and to Hall;</L>
<L>And rifled ev'ry Place, and left him Poor,</L>
<L>Who thought himself in Providence secure.</L>
<L>Thus miserable grown, he sought his Friend;</L>
<L>Have you said he contriv'd to speed my End;</L>
<L>I'm robb'd of ev'ry useful valu'd Thing,</L>
<L>Except my Bed, which no Repose can bring.</L>
<L>Quoth he, what I can spare I will bestow</L>
<L>To help your Need, but not to make you owe;</L>
<L>To me this dire Misfortune is not due,</L>
<L>I once for Caution kindly cozen'd you;</L>
<L>The Warning miss'd its Aim, yet I'm your Friend,</L>
<L>And would your Thinking with your Living mend:</L>
<L>What Virtue or good Reason can there be</L>
<L>In baiting Hooks for Vice and Robbery?</L>
<L>As Preservation is our eldest Law,</L>
<L>In which the Wise have yet observ'd no Flaw,</L>
<L>It well becomes us to secure our own,</L>
<L>While we thereby do Injury to none.</L>
<L>Can Providence be pleas'd to see us lay</L>
<L>The Fruits of Labour to be stole away?</L>
<L>If at my Face a Rogue should clench his Fist,</L>
<L>Is it Religion if I don't resist?</L>
<L>Believe me Friend 'tis not—nor God we serve,</L>
<L>By feeding Villains while our selves may starve.</L>
<L>An honest Industry becomes a Man,</L>
<L>And to preserve his Freedom if he can;</L>
<L>But if with all his prudent Care he fails</L>
<L>The last Great Day must equipoise the Scales.</L>
