<L>OH, think on my fate! once I freedom enjoy'd,</L>
<L>Was as happy as happy could be,</L>
<L>But pleasure is fled! even hope is destroy'd,</L>
<L>A captive alas! on the sea.</L>
<L>I was ta'en by the foe, 'twas the fiat of fate,</L>
<L>To tear me from her I adore,</L>
<L>When thought brings to mind my once happy estare,</L>
<L>I sigh! while I tug at the oar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Hard, hard, is my fate! Oh how galling my chain!</L>
<L>My life's steer'd by misery's chart;</L>
<L>And though 'gainst my tyrants I scorn to complain,</L>
<L>Tears gush forth to ease my full heart.</L>
<L>I disdain e'en to shrink, tho' I feel the sharp lash;</L>
<L>Yet my heart bleeds for her I adore,</L>
<L>While around me the unfeeling billows will dash,</L>
<L>I sigh! and still tug at the oar.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How fortune deceives; I had pleasure in tow,</L>
<L>The port where she dwelt we'd in view;</L>
<L>But the wish'd nuptial morn was o'er-clouded with woe,</L>
<L>And dear Anna! I hurried from you.</L>
<L>Our shallop was boarded and I borne away,</L>
<L>To behold my dear Anna no more,</L>
<L>But despair wastes my spirits, my form feels decay;</L>
