<HEAD>TO THE Flock of <HI>CHRIST,</HI> UNDER MY <HI>Pastoral Care.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Beloved Brethren, &amp; Neighbours,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I HOPE, and have reason to believe, there have been many among you, of every Age, <HI>Fearing</HI> and <HI>Trembling</HI> before GOD, and <HI>Preparing</HI> to meet Him in the way of His <HI>Judgments;</HI> and therefore you have been such a number of you, so desirous of having the following <HI>Sermon</HI> put into your hands, which if it may any ways contribute to the exciting a holy fear of GOD, and his Terrible Judgments in any, <HI>my Heart shall rejoyce, even mine.</HI></P>
<P>IT was a pleasure to me, to see your ready and general attendance upon the late day of FASTING and PRAYER, and your diligent and affectionate attention to the messages of GOD, then deliver'd to you.</P>
<P>WOULD to GOD, that this <HI>Sermon</HI> together with the seasonable and pungent Discourse you had from my worthy Brother <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Allin</HI> of <HI>Brooklin.</HI></NOTE> on the same day, may in the hands of the Almighty Spirit be instrumental to bring on the <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation,</HI> then earnestly exhorted to, as the call of GOD to us by his <HI>Judg∣ments,</HI> and by the EARTHQUAKE in a more particular manner.</P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="002861_0004_0FE6799FACFA9278"/>I Beseech you Cherish your Convictions; — Were you not almost resolved in that Week of fear and con∣cern, that you would for time to come, be more watch∣ful, prayerful and diligent in getting ready for the <HI>Coming</HI> of the <HI>Lord?</HI></P>
<P>IF the <HI>Spirit</HI> of GOD, has been thus striving with you, <HI>Quench not the Spirit; Work out your own Sal∣vation with fear and trembling:</HI> for GOD will then <HI>work in you, both to will, and to do, of his own good pleasure.</HI></P>
<P>LET the Grace of GOD shewn to others encourage and animate you, especially if any Impressions have been made, to cry earnestly to GOD to set them home.</P>
<P>RESOLVE (by the help of GOD) upon a New Life, cry day and night, for a Heart to Repent and turn from every Sin, and be restless till you are brought to that Resolution, <HI>Wherein I have done iniquity, I will do so no more;</HI> and that, <HI>The Lord our God, will we serve, and his voice will we obey.</HI></P>
<P>LET me be yet more particular: And,</P>
<P N="1">I. As to <HI>Omissions</HI> of Duty.</P>
<P>YOU that have not Pray'd in Secret, and if there be any that do it not in their Families; neglect it no longer, if you would not have the wrath of GOD poured out upon you.</P>
<P>YOU that neglect to Instruct, Restrain, and Govern your Children and Servants, endeavour to do your duty faithfully and effectually in these regards for time to come.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="002861_0005_0FE6799FD511E3F0"/>YOU that have too much neglected the <HI>Publick Worship of GOD,</HI> say now, I will no longer so for∣sake the House of the <HI>Lord:</HI> You that have been Sleepy and Slothful there, be so no more.</P>
<P>YOU that have liv'd without <HI>Baptism,</HI> to this day, <HI>Arise and be Baptized.</HI></P>
<P>YOU that were Baptiz'd in your Infancy; Remem∣ber frequently your early Consecration to GOD, and the Solemn bonds lying on you, to be the Lords. And as you come to Years of <HI>Choice,</HI> Renew the <HI>De∣dication</HI> of your selves unto the <HI>Lord:</HI> And Chuse the GOD of your Fathers to be your <HI>GOD</HI> and Por∣tion: Will you not from this time cry unto Him, to be your GOD and the Guide of your Youth?</P>
<P>YOU that have never done what <HI>Christ</HI> has com∣manded you to <HI>do in Remembrance of Him;</HI> bewail your disobedience, and be not contented while you live in it; be restless until you find those dispositions in you, that shall encorage your humble and penitent approaches to his <HI>Holy Table.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. As to <HI>Commissions</HI> of Evil.</P>
<P>YOU that have been <HI>Profane,</HI> dare not any more to take the Name of the <HI>Lord</HI> in vain. Let him now be your <HI>Fear</HI> and your <HI>Dread.</HI></P>
<P>YOU that have been <HI>Sabbath-breakers,</HI> Sanctify the Lords Sabbaths, and Reverence his Sanctuary. And know, that tho' you may escape Punishment from Men, you shall not escape the righteous Judgments of GOD.</P>
<P>YOU that have been <HI>Disobedient</HI> to <HI>Parents</HI> and <HI>Masters, Obey them in the Lord; and be obedient to your Masters — with fear, and trembling.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="002861_0006_0FE679A580528CD0"/>YOU that have been <HI>Passionate,</HI> and then unguard∣ed as to the words of your mouth; <HI>Set a watch be∣fore your mouth, keep it with a bridle, that you sin not</HI> any more <HI>with your Tongue.</HI></P>
<P>YOU that have <HI>Ly'd,</HI> and <HI>Stole, put away Lying,</HI> and <HI>Steal no more.</HI></P>
<P>IF any have been <HI>Contentious,</HI> let there be no more Contentions, or Divisions among you. <HI>If it be pos∣sible as much as lyeth in you, live peaceably with all Men.</HI></P>
<P>IF any have been keepers of Bad Company, say now to your evil Companions, <HI>Depart from me, for I will keep the Commandments of GOD.</HI></P>
<P>IF any of you have idly and needlesly spent your time at <HI>Taverns,</HI> to the wounding of Soul and Body, Name and Estate, do so no more.</P>
<P>WO, Wo will be to such as tarry long there, for at the last, it will bite like a Serpent, and sting like an Adder.</P>
<P>IF Sinners entice you to <HI>Chambering</HI> &amp; <HI>Wantoness, consent not; walk not thou in the way with them, lest you fall into the pit into which the abhorred of the Lord do fall; and mourn at the last, when your flesh and body are consumed.</HI></P>
<P>YOU that have been Extravagant, in <HI>Dress</HI> and <HI>Apparel,</HI> (another of the crying Sins of this Land and Day) Be so no more; Retrench those <HI>SU∣PERFLUITIES of NAUGHTINESS.</HI></P>
<P>YOU that have been inordinately pursuing the World to the neglect of the <HI>One Thing Needful,</HI> you now see what an uncertain and shaking Foundation you are upon; let not the things of this <HI>Passing</HI> World, any longer swallow up so much of your time and thoughts; <HI>Let your Conversation be without Cove∣tousness, and be content with such things as ye have. And be ready to distribute, and willing to communi∣cate, and withold not more than is meet, for if tendeth to Poverty.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="v" REF="002861_0007_0FE679A5A2926338"/>IN Fine,</P>
<P><HI>LET no Man go beyond, and defraud his Bro∣ther, or bear false witness against his Neighbour.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH Omissions of Duty, and Commissions of Evil, I call on you to bewail and reform, as you would be <HI>found of your Judge in peace.</HI></P>
<P>THIS you have been of late earnestly exhorted to <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">from 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.14.</NOTE> and can any of you think, you shall ever arrive to it, if such Admonitions and Calls of GOD, be not hearkned to? Bless not your selves in your own hearts, saying, I shall have <HI>peace,</HI> tho' I go on to add one Iniquity to another; for the Lord has said, He will not spare such, but his anger and jealousy shall smoke against that Man; <HI>There is no peace saith my God unto such.</HI></P>
<P>YOU can have no <HI>peace</HI> in your own <HI>Consciences,</HI> nor peace in the day of <HI>Death</HI> or <HI>Judgment,</HI> and this is what I would if possible awak'n in you a due concern and sollicitude about, as knowing what man∣ner of persons you must be in all holy <HI>conversation</HI> and <HI>godliness,</HI> if you would be found <HI>blameless</HI> in that Day.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Reformation</HI> urg'd upon you, is to bring you into such a <HI>Conversation,</HI> that you may thereby lay a foundation for peace and comfort in the Day that is approching, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all the things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the <HI>Son of Man.</HI></P>
<P>AND for your Quickning; Suffer me to use with you the three following <HI>Motives.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="002861_0008_0FE679A7C26C3570"/>MOT. I. <HI>THE coming of the Lord is doubtless foretold to excite and quicken us to diligence in get∣ting ready for it.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was written for our admonition and warn∣ing upon whom the <HI>ends of the world are come.</HI> GOD foresaw how carnally secure and stupid a wicked World would be, how ready to put far from them the day of his coming; that they might therefore be rowz'd out of such security, he does by his Prophets and Apostles solemnly warn a secure World to prepare for it, <HI>lest coming suddenly, he finds us sleeping.</HI> Now surely, the Great GOD would not do thus, nor speak so much of his <HI>coming,</HI> were it not to quicken us to a diligent and instant preparing for it. Hence the Prophet <HI>Joel</HI> after he had prophesy'd of the Terrible Day of the Lord approaching, he immediately exhorts to <HI>Repent, and turn to the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Joel</HI> 2.12.</NOTE>. So that it seems evidently to be the great design and end of GOD in denouncing his Judgments and particularly, in the awful predictions of that Great Day of the Lord's coming upon a secure World, to awaken Men to the utmost care and diligence in getting ready for his <HI>Coming.</HI></P>
<P>MOT. II. <HI>OUR Condition will be unutterably distressing if we are not prepar'd for the Lords Com∣ing, if we shall then be found in a Christless Estate.</HI></P>
<P>IF that Great and Terrible Day we look for, should speedily arrive, when <HI>the Heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the Elements shall melt with fervent heat, the Earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be burnt up;</HI> and the Son of Man, the glorious Judge of the World, shall personally and vi∣sibly descend with a glorious retinue of Holy Angels, and that voice, that <HI>Midnight</HI> cry, shall be heard,
<PB N="vii" REF="002861_0009_0FE679A7E5002718"/>
ARISE YE DEAD, AND COME TO JUDGMENT; If this were to be the Day of the glorious descent of the Son of GOD, in which he were to punish with an Everlasting destruction from his presence &amp; the glory of his power, all such as have not obey'd his Gospel: How terrible must his Approach be? Finding our selves among the number of his Enemies, who would not have him to reign over us. We shall in the midst of our confusion with <HI>bitterness of heart, and bitter wailing</HI> reflect on our past refusals of offer'd Grace and Mercy, when we were so often intreated to be reconciled to GOD, to make haste to Christ, as our City of Refuge, that in such a day we might have been hid under the shadow of his wings, and had a blessed time of refreshment from the presence of the LORD:</P>
<P>WE shall think with anguish upon the many war∣nings we had of such a day approaching, and hastning upon us, and yet that we should regard them no more: that we should notwithstanding go on in the ways of our hearts and in the sight of our eyes, ful∣filling the desires of the flesh, &amp; of the mind, without any grief or remorse of Spirit at all therefor: that the calls we had to <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation</HI> one time after another, shou'd be so slighted and disregarded by us; that tho' Christ stood so long at the doors of our Souls, knocking for entrance, desiring to come in, and take possession of us, for himself, that he might rule and reign in us, &amp; conform us to his holy Image and likeness; that we notwithstanding bolted the door fast against him, were so slothful and sluggish that we would not arise to let him in. And alas, We now see, we are miserable and undone without Him, that there's none can save or help us but Christ: Though it will be now in vain to look for Salvation from the Hills, or the Multitude of the Mountains, yet we shall not forbear crying to the rocks &amp; mountains, we see making and trembling about us, to fall upon us, and hide us from the presence of him that sits upon
<PB N="viii" REF="002861_0010_0FE679AF0E7C6790"/>
the Throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb. We shall dread to make our Personal appearance before the Judge of the whole Earth; How glad should we be, we might in a moment be annihilated, and return to our first nothing? But when we see, we must whether we will or no, immediately attend the Sum∣mons, and appear before our Judge, and receive our Doom; Oh with what reluctance, shame and regret, must we be forc'd away to the Bar of GOD, whom we shall behold as a <HI>consuming Fire,</HI> ready to adjudge us to Everlasting Fire with the Devil and his Angels, in this lower World all on Fire ready to devour us; How shall we tremble, and die away with anguish, to think, we must now take up our dwelling in Flames, and though we should lift up our Eyes, and cry for a drop of Water, to cool us while so tormented, there would be no hope of obtaining it.</P>
<P>IF We should beg some of the <HI>Saints</HI> to take pity on us, their bowels will not yern towards us; though they know us, as deform'd and wtetched as we ap∣pear, and it may be were near and dear to us, while together on Earth, and were then willing to have done their utmost for our comfort, they will not at all relent for us, now, they'l be intirely satisfy'd in the final determination of the <HI>Righteous Judge.</HI></P>
<P>NOR will the <HI>Holy Angels</HI> minister to our relief, in that day: They were ever ready before, to do us acts of kindness, and many were the kind and good Offices done by them for us, and glad would they have been to have seen us heirs of Salvation, and to have ministred to us, as such, at such a Day; but since we were not by all the goodness of GOD, engag'd to love, and serve, and live devoted to him, they'l know that our condemnation is just, that we are justly miserable, and deserve no pity or relief from them, no more than from the Saints, and therefore they'l never hearken to any cries or intreaties from us. Which way shall we then turn our selves?—</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="002861_0011_0FE679AF2FDA5DC0"/>SURELY we cant hope, nor in the least expect, any relief from the <HI>Evil Angels;</HI> Though they sooth'd and flatter'd us, while we hearkned to their vile sol∣licitations, as if there was no danger, we might go on securely, and never feel such impressions of the wrath of GOD, we were often threatn'd withal, they'l now its probable be so far from attempting our relief, that they'l with cruel Joy be the executiouers of GOD'S holy vengeance on us; and will upbraid us exceed∣ingly for our inexcusable folly, in regarding their Sollicitations as we did, from one time to another, when even our own Consciences condemn'd us at the same time: They will be doubtless instrumental of increasing, if possible, our everlasting vexation and sorrow, while tormented with them.</P>
<P>BUT cannot the <HI>Multitudes</HI> in torment with us, afford some relief; won't the vast numbers of our <HI>Fellow-Creatures</HI> with us, be some alleviation, or in some Measure abate our Torments? Surely we cant have the least hope of this: the beholding of them in Torment may be an aggravation, or increase of ours: We may perhaps, behold several under the same condemnation, tearing themselves and cursing of us, as having been instrumental of their ruin, by our evil examples, by enticing them into those paths that led down to those Chambers of Death: If they had not hearkn'd to our Sollicitations to evil, and been Companions with us, they might have been rejoy∣cing with Saints and Angels, in the Kingdom of GOD; but such was the pernicious bewitching in∣fluence of our evil Conversation, that they were miserably deluded and led away thereby, and so were never rescued out of the paths of the destroyer: With what indignation and revenge must such behold one another, and how will such Reflections exasperate their angry furious minds, and add to their extreme anguish?</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="002861_0012_0FE679B1CF769E40"/>AND</P>
<P>FINALLY, When they consider, there will be no <HI>Intermission</HI> of their Torment, and no <HI>End</HI> of it, that the Worm shall never Die, nor the Fire be ever Quenched; who can possibly imagine how cutting and tormenting such Reflections must be?</P>
<P>BUT its impossible for me to give you any adaequate Ideas or conceptions thereof; I have now endeavour'd to raise some Ideas in your Minds of the miserable distressing Condition you will be in, if found out of CHRIST at his <HI>Coming.</HI></P>
<P>AND I appeal to your <HI>Conscience,</HI> whether you have not the same Apprehensions as to those, who will be then found in an Unconverted Estate; and if you have, should not the Consideration of it, excite you to the utmost care and diligence, that you may be found of him in Peace?</P>
<P>AND thus I have consider'd something of the an∣guish that must fill the Souls of those who shall be found in a Christless Estate, if the Day of the Lord should immediately come upon us.</P>
<P>I will now go on to consider something of the like distress, of Christless Souls in the day of their Death, when the Lord shall in this way come unto them.</P>
<P>THE Lord may be yet <HI>Long-suffering</HI> towards an evil World, and for wise and holy ends delay his <HI>Coming</HI> to <HI>Judgment;</HI> GOD may have yet more great and glorious things to accomplish before his <HI>Coming,</HI> in this sense. But when it shall be, is re∣served as a secret in his own Eternal Councils: <HI>Of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the Angels in Heaven, nor the Son of Man.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="002861_0013_0FE679B1F236FB00"/>BUT if we should suppose it to be yet a great way off, yet the Day of the Lords coming to us by Death, and so calling us immediately after to <HI>Judg∣ment,</HI> we certainly know, this coming of the Lord, cannot be far off, and that determines our State for Eternity as surely, as if it were the general Day of <HI>Judgment.</HI> And how soon the day of our Death may come upon us, is altogether uncertain to us; our Souls may this <HI>very night</HI> be required of us.</P>
<P>IF the Messenger of Death were to call us out of this World, before the light of another Morning, should we not dread the King of Terrors thus ap∣proaching to us, to behold the <HI>Pale Horse</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> and <HI>Hell</HI> with him, or <HI>following after him;</HI> If we evidently felt our lives drawing nigh to the Grave, that our Immortal Spirits must presently leave these dissolving Bodies, and take their flight into the unseen World of Spirits to take up our Everlasting abode there, if we had the free use and exercise of our Reason and understanding, how distressing would the prospect be to us, finding our selves hastning to a Day we are utterly unprovided for; a day, that notwith∣standing all the Warnings we have had, we have put far from us — and so have left undone many things we should, and thought to have done, and have been doing many things, we had better have left undone, and so have been laying in for a bitter Repentance, against such a day: We shall now find our selves in ill terms with Heaven, see nothing but Frowns in the face of GOD, and find him rebuking us in his anger, and chastning us in his hot displeasure, the terrors of GOD setting themselves in array against us, filling us with terrible impressions of fiery indignation and wrath ready to devour us; We shall with grief of heart reflect on our not being perswaded by those who knowing the terrors of the Lord were often warning and urging us to flee the wrath to come, to make our peace with GOD, and get ready for a dying Day.</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="002861_0014_0FE679B957F94888"/>AND now, finding our selves utterly unfit for the Kingdom of GOD, having hearts full of enmity to GOD, and Christ, and Holiness, and knowing we have never heartily submitted to Christs Kingly power and government, but been trampling his Holy Laws under our feet, and so have dishonor'd his Name, quench'd and vex'd his holy Spirit, and wounded our Souls, and have the guilt of all lying upon us, a burden heavy enough to sink us into the pit of ever∣lasting sorrows; Oh how oppressed and distressed may we well be? We us'd to think light of Sin be∣fore, and could run into the commission of it, with little or no concern; But now we see, they are fools who make a mock at Sin, and that all Sin is infinitely more provoking to GOD, than ever we thought it to be: Beginning now to feel what the wages of Sin are, we may well <HI>fear</HI> and <HI>tremble,</HI> The death of the Body is very awful, to think of being presently turn'd into a lifeless lump of Clay, and hid in the Grave; but this has not such a shocking, terrifying aspect, as the fears of a second Death, the death of the Soul, the everlasting seperation of it from the presence of GOD, to hear from the mouth of our incensed Judge, that Sentence, <HI>Depart from me ye workers of iniquity, I know you not; depart from me ye cursed into everlast∣ing fire prepared for the Devil and his angels.</HI> Oh the direful convulsions &amp; tremblings we may be well put into! But I pass from this Melancholy Head, to one more pleasant and delightful.</P>
<P>MOT. III. <HI>WE shall be inexpressibly and incon∣ceivably blessed, if we are found of our Judge in peace, without spot and blameless.</HI></P>
<P>IF we are of the number who have fled for refuge to <HI>Christ,</HI> have by a true and lively faith laid hold on his <HI>glorious Righteousness,</HI> and thereby obtain'd <HI>Peace,</HI> and <HI>Justification</HI> before GOD; with what calmness and
<PB N="xiii" REF="002861_0015_0FE679B978836C28"/>
serenity of Mind, may we entertain the thoughts of the Lords coming, either as to his <HI>visible</HI> &amp; <HI>personal Coming in the glory of his Father, with the Holy Angels, or his coming</HI> to us in the way of <HI>Mortality;</HI> His coming in both ways is what we have employ'd our thoughts much upon, and have been above all things concerned that we might be ready for; while others have made it their great enquiry, what they should eat and drink and wherewithal they should be clothed, it has been our great Sollicitude what we should do that we might inherit Eternal Life, that we might be entituled to, and made meet for the Inheritance of the Saints in light; our Souls have been therefore following hard after GOD, prizing and earnestly seeking communion with him in the way of Ordinances, according to his Command and direction, and have thereby obtain'd gracious Manifestations of his Love &amp; favour, so that we have comfortable grounds of hope, that a new and saving change has pass'd upon us, that we are born of the Spirit, and born from above, are by a gracious adoption become the Children of GOD, and heirs of the Heavenly inheritance, and are daily pre∣paring &amp; ripening for the employments &amp; enjoyments of the Kingdom of GOD: With what pleasure and satisfaction may such look for the coming of their Sa∣viour in the Clouds of Heaven? When he shall thus appear, it will be to their Eternal joy, for in a moment they shall be changed, this corruptible shall put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality, and so Death shrll be swallowed up in victory, and they shall be caught up in the air, and be together, &amp; for∣ever with the Lord: So that they may now sincerely and chearfully pray, <HI>Come Lord Jesus, come quickly.</HI> And if He should speedily come by Death, he shall be a most welcome messenger to them. Knowing their Saviour has by dying tak'n away the sting of Death, they shall be able to sing that Song of triumph; <HI>O Death where is thy Sting, O Grave where is thy
<PB N="xiv" REF="002861_0016_0FE679BAEE60B228"/>
Victory!</HI> Its refreshing to them to think Christ him∣self descended into the dark and silent Grave, to make it a bed of rest for them, that their Bodies might sleep quietly there, and awake refresh't in the bright and glorious morning of the Resurrection, and then stand up in their lot, &amp; share in the joys &amp; glories of the Resurrection World: And that their <HI>Spirits</HI> guarded by Holy Angels thro' the territories of the Prince of the power of the air, shall go immediately to the Paradise of GOD, to the mansions prepared for them in their heavenly fathers house, to associate with glorious and holy Angels, and the Spirits of just men made perfect, to be led by the Lamb that is in the midst of the Throne to living Fountains of Waters, and have all tears wip'd away from their eyes, &amp; spend an eternity in admiring &amp; adoring riches of redeeming love and grace manifested towards them; And they shall have an inexpressibly satisfying assurance of all this imme∣diately after their Death; for being found cloth'd with the glorious <HI>Robe</HI> of the <HI>Righteousness of Christ,</HI> they shall be presented before the presence of his glory, <HI>with exceeding joy;</HI> and immediately hear that Blessed Sentence, from the mouth of their Saviour and Judge, <HI>Come ye blessed of my Father, Inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the World.</HI> But eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it enter'd into the Heart of Man to conceive of the blessedness of those who shall be found ready and prepared for the <HI>Coming of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>YOU are I trust, (thro' grace) a number of you, (DEARLY BELOVED) Heirs of such blessedness,— and have this evidence of it, that <Q>You are diligent that you may be found of your Judge in peace, with∣out spot and blameless; I am perswaded such things of you, and things that accompany Salvation; for GOD is not unrighteous to forget your work, and labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his

<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM, CXIX. CXX.</HI></BIBL>
<P>MY Flesh Trembleth for fear of Thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>I PERSWADE my self, this <HI>Text</HI> has imployed the thoughts of many of us, since we have felt the awful <HI>Shaking</HI> and <HI>Trembling</HI> of the EARTH under us, that we have been, and are now ready upon it to Cry out, <HI>My Flesh Trembleth for fear of Thee, and I am afraid of thy Judgments.</HI> It is a Day of no little distress, concern and fear, and it may well be so; and what a holy and provoked GOD may be about to do with us, HE only knows. 'Tis certain, our <HI>Trans∣gressions have been multiplyed, and our Iniquities do testify against us.</HI> And the Lord has been in Years past, in various ways awfully testifying his Anger and Displeasure against us, and we may well be afraid of his doing thus yet more awfully and terribly: I believe
<PB N="2" REF="002861_0020_0FE679C195F3F308"/>
and am perswaded that this is <HI>this Day,</HI> the great fear of every one that truly fears the Great GOD; and would to GOD, there were not so much grounds for it, to Fear, That the Lord will yet dispense more terrible things in Righteousness to a Sinful Unreformed People. Sure I am, the Spirits of all Flesh in the midst of us, have reason enough to tremble for fear what GOD may further bring upon us. I shall Improve the Words then, on this Solemn Occasion as applicable not only to particular Persons, but more especially to a back-sliding and sinful People, and accordingly observe this <HI>Doctrine</HI> from them, for our present <HI>Instruction</HI> and <HI>Improvement.</HI></P>

</DIV1>
</BODY>
</TEXT></Q>
<P>IN the Prosecution of this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> I will shew,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>WHAT may be meant by the Judgments of GOD, and what Judgments we are exposed to, and may be afraid of?</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>WHAT may be meant by Trembling for fear of GOD, and being afraid of his Judgments?</HI></P>
<P>AND then,</P>
<P N="3">III. &amp; lastly. <HI>SUCH may be our Condition and Circumstances, that we may have abundant reason to be so.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. I am to shew, <HI>WHAT may be meant by the Judgments of GOD, and what judgments we are exposed to, and may be afraid of?</HI></P>
<P>FOR Answer,</P>
<P><HI>THE Judgments of GOD are those manifestati∣ons of his vindictive or corrective Justice, whereby He lets the World know, what a Sin-hating GOD He is.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002861_0021_0FE679C1B987BCC8"/>THESE Judgments are Temporal, Spiritual and Eternal. GOD can arm the whole Creation against us, and make every thing we enjoy to be destructive to us. GOD does not willingly afflict or greive the Children of Men; but when by their Sins they provoke Him, he sends down his Judgments on them; the Judgments of GOD are the proper Object of a na∣tural Mans fear, for hereby GOD discovers his just displeasure at Sin, Psal. 9.15. <HI>The Lord is known by the Judgments which he executeth:</HI> Yea, Godly Men have been afraid of GOD'S Judgments; thus was the Psalmist in the Text, <HI>I am afraid of thy Judgments;</HI> so was holy Job, 31.23. <HI>Destruction from God was a terror to me.</HI> Various are the Judgments of GOD, and the rebukes of Heaven, we lye exposed unto, and are often suffering and groaning under. The Great GOD who is holy in all his ways and righteous in all his works, is sometimes provok'd to come out in Judgment, and to write bitter things against us in the way of his Providence. It is sometimes the So∣vereign and holy Pleasure of GOD, to lay us under some sore Judgments, and to threaten the infliction of yet more, and greater; There are the Judgments of <HI>Sword, Famine,</HI> and <HI>Sickness,</HI> the Lord often brings upon us. He sometimes sends cleaness of teeth, a great scarcity of the necessaries of Life, sometimes he with∣holds the Rain, which makes the Earth Fruitful, causing the <HI>Heavens over us to be as brass, and the earth under us as iron, and the rain of the land powder and dust:</HI> We have sometimes had sad occa∣sion to say with the Prophet, Joel, <HI>chap.</HI> 1.19, <HI>The fire has devoured the pastures of the Wilderness, the rivers of water are dried up,</HI> &amp;c. So does GOD sometimes visit his People with scorching Droughts, and sometimes with long and excessive Rains, the Fruits of the Earth have been often diminished, the Trees not yeilded their Fruit, nor the Land its usual Increase. Sometimes GOD sends Infectious, Epidem∣ical
<PB N="4" REF="002861_0022_0FE679CA35510858"/>
Sickness, that proves Mortal, and sweeps away Multitudes, the slain of the Lord have been awfully multiplied in one place and another; there is also the Judgment of the <HI>Sword,</HI> when GOD lets loose the enemy upon us, to waste our Substance, and de∣stroy the Lives of many. How dreadfully has a So∣vereign and Righteous GOD punish'd us in Years past, by long and bloody Wars, when we have seen <HI>Gar∣ments roll'd in Blood, our young Men slain,</HI> and many carried into a miserable Captivity, and there poyson'd with the <HI>Romish Religion?</HI> There are also the Judg∣ments of <HI>Storms and Tempests of Wind, Thunder and Lightning,</HI> which we have seen and felt to an un∣common degree, in the Weeks and Months that are past; But a very few Weeks ago, upon the Evening before the Sabbath, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sept.</HI> 16.</NOTE> what a Violent Storm did the Lord bring down upon us, how awful were the Effects of it in our Orchards, and among the <HI>Trees of the Woods,</HI> in one place, and another, and not a little damage thereby sustained; yea some in the City were sorely Wounded, and One Slain. And now, upon the Evening after the Sabbath, the Lord has bro't up∣on us, the unusual and terrible Judgment of the EARTHQUAKE; we have thus seen that awful word fulfill'd, Isa. 29.6. <HI>Thou shall be visited of the Lord of hosts, with thunder, and with Earthquake, and great noise, with storm, and tempest, and flame of devouring fire;</HI> and that in Psal. 18.7. <HI>Then the Earth shook and trembled, the foundations also of the hills moved, and were shaken —.</HI> Among the awful Judgments of GOD, this of the EARTHQUAKE is much spoken of. It is very particularly and most awfully, in the <HI>twenty fourth Chapter of Isaiah,</HI> which you may do well to read this Day with a very great attention; I will single out a few verses, and read them to you now; <HI>Behold the Lord maketh the
<PB N="5" REF="002861_0023_0FE679CA5C532110"/>
Earth empty, and maketh it wast, and turneth it up∣side down, and scattereth abroad the Inhabitants thereof. The Land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled, for the Lord hath spoken this word, the Earth mourneth, and fadeth away, the World languisheth. The haughty People of the Earth do languish; the earth also is defiled under the Inhabi∣tants thereof, because they have transgressed the laws, and broken the everlasting covenant; therefore hath the Curse devoured the earth, and they that dwell therein, are desolate, therefore the Inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left, all the merry hearted do sigh: the noise of them that rejoyce endeth; they shall not drink wine with a song, strong drink shall be bitter to them that drink it; all joy is dark∣ned, the mirth of the land is gone; in the City is left desolation, fear, and the pit, and the snare are upon thee, O Inhabitant of the earth; and it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise of the fear, shall fall into the pit, and he that cometh up out of the midst of the pit, shall be taken in the snare; for the windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the earth do shake: the earth is moved exceedingly, the earth shall reel to and fro like a Drunkard: and the transgression thereof shall be heavy upon it, and it shall fall and not rise again.</HI> In Isaiah, Chap. 2. from the 19 ver. we read, <HI>In that day, they shall go into the holes of the Rocks, and into the caves of the earth for fear of the Lord, and the glory of his Majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the Earth.</HI> In the 13th Chap. at the 13th ver. we also read of the Lords <HI>Shaking the Heavens, and the Earth, removing out of her place;</HI> The Prophet <HI>Ezekiel</HI> also speaks of it, Ezek. 38.19, 20. <HI>In that day, there shall be a great shaking in the Land,</HI> &amp;c. The Prophet <HI>Joel</HI> also; <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Chap. 2. from the begin.</NOTE> <HI>Let all the Inhabitants of the Land
<PB N="6" REF="002861_0024_0FE679CB8DA81418"/>
tremble, for the Day of the Lord cometh, for it is nigh at hand, a day of darkness, and gloominess, a day of clouds, and of thick darkness, there has not been ever the like, nor shall be any more after it, a fire devoureth before them, and behind them a flame burneth, the people shall be much pained, all faces shall gather blackness, the earth shall quake before them, the heavens shall tremble, the sun and moon shall be dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining, and the Lord shall utter his voice before his army; His Camp is very great, for he is strong that executeth his word, for the day of the Lord is great, and very terrible, and who can abide it?</HI> He speaks of it again in the next Chapter, <HI>The day of the Lord is near,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>The Lord also shall rore out of Zion, and the Heavens and the Earth shall shake,</HI> The Prophet Haggai says, Chap. 2 6. <HI>For thus saith the Lord of Hosts, yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens and the earth, and the Sea, and the dry land, and I will shake all nations:</HI> The Prophet <HI>Malachi</HI> also speaks of this day of the Lord; Mal. 4.1. <HI>For behold the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be as stubble, and the day that cometh, shall burn them up, saith the Lord of hosts, that it shall leave them, neither root, nor branch.</HI> In the Gospel we read of <HI>Earth∣quakes,</HI> as forerunners of our <HI>Saviours</HI> coming to Judg∣ment, Math. 24.7, 8. <HI>There shall be Famines and Pestilences, and Earthquakes, all these are the begin∣ning of sorrows:</HI> He speaks here of the <HI>Son of Man's coming in the Clouds of Heaven, with Power and great Glory,</HI> and of the same signs preceeding it, that the Prophets but now mentioned spake of; The Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> also, in the third Chapter of his Second Epistle, speaks remarkably of our hasting unto the coming of this Day of GOD, and of its coming most suddenly and unexpectedly upon a secure unprepared World, <HI>When the Heavens should pass away with a
<PB N="7" REF="002861_0025_0FE679CBB1550B28"/>
great noise, and the Elements melt with fervent heat,</HI> &amp;c. So that, we may well look for such awful shak∣ing dispensations, as we have been this Week under; They are indeed very terrible, and GOD only knows, what will be the issue — It certainly looks as if GOD was very Angry with us, and we ripe for his terrible Judgments; And therefore when GOD threatens to bring them, and this of the <HI>Earthquake</HI> in a particular manner he says, Isa. 13.13. <HI>I will shake the Heavens, and the Earth shall remove out of her place, in the wrath of the Lord of hosts, and in the day of his fierce anger;</HI> And also in Ezek. 38.19. <HI>For in my Jealousy, and in the fire of my wrath, have I spoken, surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land,</HI> &amp;c. Our Flesh therefore trembles for fear of what GOD may be about to do, by this <HI>Judicial Dispensation,</HI> in a more especial manner.</P>
<P>I might Finally, under this Head speak of <HI>Spiritual Plagues and Judgments,</HI> we ly expos'd to, and its to be fear'd, many have dreadfully expos'd themselves to their being inflicted on them, and these are the worst of Judgments, to be given up to blindness of mind, and hardness of heart, to be cast away from the presence of GOD, and to have his holy Spirit cease striving with us, to have the word, and means of grace made a savour of Death unto Death, having a blinding and hardning efficacy on the hearts of Men. Oh Dreadful Judgments! And above all other to be deprecated, for if this Judgment be inflicted on any, they will ripen apace for Eternal Destruction; If they are con∣tinued longer upon the Earth, it will be only <HI>to fill up the measure of their Iniquities, and treasure up to themselves wrath against the day of wrath, and re∣velation of the righteous Judgments of God, which will be reveal'd against them,</HI> and forever inflicted on them in the World they are going into.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002861_0026_0FE679D27812B4B0"/>BUT this may suffice for the First Particular, <HI>viz.</HI> What may be meant by the <HI>Judgments</HI> of GOD, and What the <HI>Judgments</HI> are, we are exposed unto, and may be afraid of?</P>
<P>THEY are outward and Temporal, and also Spiri∣tual and Eternal Plagues and Judgments.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE Second thing propos'd was to shew, <HI>What may be meant by Trembling for fear of GOD, and being afraid of his Judgments?</HI></P>
<P>AND here,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT may mean, or imply in it, our Solemn &amp; Aw∣ful Apprehensions of the Great GOD, who brings such Judgments upon us.</HI> That we adore his Infinite Wisdom, and Almighty Power, adore Him as a GOD <HI>wise in heart, and mighty in strength, against whom none ever hardned themselves and prosper'd, who re∣moveth the mountains, and they know not, who over∣turneth them in his anger, who shaketh the earth out of her place, and at whose presence the pillars thereof tremble:</HI> That we Sanctify the Lord of Hosts himself, and make Him our Fear and our Dread: That we adore his Sovereignty and Righteousness, in his awful dispensations, that we imploy our serious, devout, and solemn thoughts on these, and other glorious Excellencies &amp; Perfections of Almighty GOD display'd in his Judgments; they must be the Subject of our frequent &amp; solemn Meditations, that so we may always maintain on our Hearts suitable Apprehensions of the Great GOD who sends his Judgments upon us.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT may imply in it, and mean our being sensibly touched and affected with the consideration of the Judgments that are, or may be yet brought upon us.</HI> That we so resent them, as that they make deep im∣pressions upon our Hearts, that our Spirits are most sorrowfully affected with the tokens of the Divine
<PB N="9" REF="002861_0027_0FE679D29DBBD100"/>
anger visible therein; and that we weep bitterly in secret places, in the consideration thereof, wishing <HI>our heads were waters, and our eyes a fountain of tears, that we might weep day and night therefor.</HI> Thus griev'd and concern'd should we be continually, which may be very much meant by our <HI>trembling for fear of God, and being afraid of his Judgments.</HI> Our Hearts then being deeply &amp; sorrowfully affected with the Judgments of Heaven inflicted, or threatned, may be meant hereby.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>HEREBY may be meant our humbling our selves exceedingly before GOD who is thus visiting, and threatning of us.</HI> That we lay our hands on our mouths, and our mouths in the dust before Him, and there <HI>repent and abhor our selves;</HI> that we do, while trembling before him, judge and condemn our selves, acknowledging we are guilty before GOD, and that he might justly be angry with us, till he hath consum'd us, so that there should be no remnant, nor escaping. We must humbly acknowledge and declare the Lord to be just, in whatever He is pleased to lay upon us, that he does right, but we have done wickedly, that he punishes us much less than our iniquities have deserv'd, that he shall be therefore justified when he speaketh, and clear when he Judgeth, that we will accept the punishment of our Sins, and bear the indig∣nation of the Lord, because we have sinned against Him. That we continue sighing and crying for the abominations that are committed among us, for the many provoking evils that are to be found in the midst of us, to the infinite dishonor of the Holy GOD, and the wounding of many precious Souls.</P>
<P>Again,</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THIS may imply in it, the greatness of our fear and distress.</HI> It is here spoken, as if the appre∣hensions
<PB N="10" REF="002861_0028_0FE679D3F3EE0588"/>
of GOD'S Judgments did so affright the Psalmist, as nothing else could. It is doubtless thus express'd to set forth the greatness of his fear, how deeply he resented the hand of GOD therein; we see how <HI>Moses</HI> resented the Judgments of GOD, Psal. 90.11. <HI>Who knoweth the power of his Anger, even according to thy fear so is thy wrath.</HI> We must so resent the Judgments of GOD, as to manifest, they are no light and trivial matters to us, as the Psalmist did, and there∣fore prays as in Psal. 6.1. <HI>O Lord Rebuke me not in thine anger, nor chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</HI> When Men are much affrighted, how do their Count∣enances change, and their Bodies tremble, and what can cause this more than the sense of GOD'S Anger, which he manifests in his Judgments, if we are rightly sensible of them; How did <HI>Belshazzars knees shake and tremble</HI> at that Judgment threatned in the <HI>Writing on the Wall;</HI> yea, how did the Holy Pro∣phet <HI>Habakkuk, Tremble</HI> for fear of GOD, Hab. 3.16. <HI>When I heard my belly trembled, my lips quivered at the voice, rotteness enter'd into my bones, and I trembled in my self.</HI> And so the Psalmist does in these words express the greatness of his fear, at the apprehen∣sion of GOD'S displeasure in his Judgments. So then they may imply, our fearing nothing so much as the Lords anger in his judicial dispensations; that the consideration hereof fills us with the greatest fear and concern of Spirit, that GOD has been so provok'd to come out against us in his Anger, and to threaten our utter ruin and desolation.</P>
<P>Once more,</P>
<P N="5">5. &amp; lastly, <HI>THS fear, and trembling may imply in it, a conscientious and diligent care to avoid and forsake every provoking evil, and repair to GOD in Christ, as our only City of Refuge for Safety.</HI> That our fear of GOD excites us <HI>to depart from all
<PB N="11" REF="002861_0029_0FE679D42F8F3390"/>
evil,</HI> to abstain from appearances of it, and approaches towards it, that we therefore <HI>Stand in awe of GOD,</HI> and dread to allow our selves in the commission of any known evils, which are the procuring causes of the Divine Anger; that we do with a holy fear and con∣cern of Soul, in our times of distress and danger, under Judgments inflicted, or fear'd, make haste to Christ and get under the shadow of his wings; that should be our language while we are <HI>Fearing</HI> and <HI>Trembling</HI> before Him, Psal. 57.1. <HI>Be merciful unto me O God, Be merciful unto me, for my Soul trusteth in thee, yea, in the shadow of thy wings, will I make my refuge, until these Calamities be overpast.</HI></P>
<P>SUCH things as these may be imply'd in our <HI>Tremb∣ling for fear of GOD, and being afraid of his Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>I Proceed now to the Third and last Head Propounded.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>THAT such may be our Condition and Circumstances, that we may have abundant reason and occasion thus to Tremble and be Afraid.</HI></P>
<P>A Professing People may be left to fall into sad de∣generacies, to forsake the Lord, the Lord GOD of their Fathers, they <HI>may</HI> be left to depart from the blessed truths of GOD, and may forsake GOD in respect of his holy Institutions, his holy Worship and Ordinances, and forsake him in respect of Conversation, by walk∣ing in the ways of <HI>Pride, Sensuality, and Unright∣eousness,</HI> by being <HI>Unholy and Profane;</HI> the fear of GOD may be evidently wanting in Men, there may be scandalous miscarriages in many, firming against great light, love &amp; grace. Such may be, &amp; are our apostasies from the good ways of the Lord, that He may say to us, as in Jer. 2.21. <HI>I planted thee, a noble vine, wholly
<PB N="12" REF="002861_0030_0FE679DBEC392AC0"/>
a right seed, How art thou turned into the degenerate, plant of a strange vine unto me.</HI> It is recorded con∣cerning the Children of Israel, Judg. 2.17. <HI>They turned quickly out of the ways which their Fathers walked in, obeying the Commandments of the Lord; but they did not so.</HI> Their Fathers did endeavour to uphold Religion in the power of it, but their Children did not so. See how <HI>Moses</HI> once spake to them, Numb. 32.14. <HI>Behold ye are risen up, in your Fathers stead, an increase of sinful men.</HI> Alas! How much is it thus, at this Day; the first Generation of Christians is gone off the Stage, &amp; in a manner the second, and is there not another and a more sinful risen up in their stead? We read in Joel 1.2. <HI>Hear this ye old Men, and give ear all ye Inhabitants of the land, hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your Fathers saith the Lord.</HI> Were there such Judgments formerly, as now there are: You may therefore con∣clude, you have departed from GOD, and by your sins have provok'd him so to punish you. And may it not be thus said, with reference to our state, and circumstances &amp; the late dispensations of GOD towards us, Alas! for us! Had we ever more reason to stand trembling before GOD under fearful apprehensions of impending vengeance; when we consider of the many scandalous provoking evils abounding among us, such as <HI>Oppression, Injustice, Cozning &amp; Deceit, Fals∣hood and Evil Speaking, Pride, and Contention, In∣temperance, Drunkenness, Unchastity, an Excessive In∣ordinate love to the World,</HI> and I may add <HI>the Rude∣ness and Profaneness of Young People?</HI> How is GOD himself and our duty to him evidently neglected and forgotten by many, and a form of Godliness maintain'd and kept up, without the life and power of it? How is the sacred and dreadful Name of GOD dishonored, and blasphem'd, by profane Cursing and Swearing? How are his holy Sabbaths instead of being strictly observ'd and sanctify'd, very much profan'd, by idle,
<PB N="13" REF="002861_0031_0FE679DC10F2DE00"/>
vain, trifling and unsutable Carriages? Do not some <HI>Forsake the House of the Lord,</HI> frequently neglecting, and needlessly staying away from the Publick Worship of GOD? And have not the Lords holy Ordinances and Institutions a manifest contempt put upon them? How many are regardless of coming up to them in a serious and worthy manner? Finally here, Dont mu∣tual Christian love and Charity grow cold, the love of Men to GOD, and their Neighbour, a visible cold∣ness and indifference towards GOD and the power of Godliness? Alas for this People! Are not such and many more iniquities prevailing among us, and testi∣fying against us, that loudly proclame our impiety and great degeneracy, that we are an impenitent in∣corrigible, and unreformed People still, and ripening apace for a destruction without remedy? Surely then if the case be thus with us, we have reason to tremble for fear of GOD, and to be greatly afraid of his Judg∣ments; we may well be afraid of temporal plagues and Judgments, of heavier and sorer, than we have been yet visited withall; for the transgressions of GOD'S Covenant People are evceedingly provoking to Him, and deserve to be severely punish'd, yea, they are the more offensive and provoking for their being a People in Covenant, GOD'S professing People; Amos 3.2. <HI>You only have I known above all the Families of the Earth, therefore will I punish you for your iniquities.</HI> See how GOD once solemnly threatned to punish a professing People, we may well tremble when we read, and be afraid of the Judgments threatn'd in the 26th <HI>Chapter</HI> of <HI>Leviticus,</HI> from the 14th <HI>v.</HI> <Q>But if ye will not hearken unto me, if ye shall despise my Statutes, and break my Covenant, I will do this unto you, I will appoint over you, Terror, Con∣sumption and the burning Ague, that shall cause sorrow of Heart, and I will set my face against you, they that hate you shall reign over you; and if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I
<PB N="14" REF="002861_0032_0FE679DD54930F30"/>
will punish you seven times more for your sins, I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass, the land shall not yield its increase, neither shall the trees of the land yeild their fruits; and if ye will walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me, I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins, I will make you few in number, and your high ways shall be desolate, and if ye will not be reform'd by these things, but will walk contrary unto me, then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins, and will bring a Sword upon you, that shall avenge the quarrel of my Co∣venant, and I will send the Pestilence among you, and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the E∣nemy, and my Soul shall abhor you, and I will make your Cities waste, and bring your Sanctuaries unto Desolation, and I will bring the Land into Desolation, your Land shall be desolate and your Cities waste.</Q> Mayn't we be justly afraid at this Day of the fulfilment of these terrible threatnings; Indeed some of them have been awfully inflicted al∣ready, &amp; when we consider of our many and greivous provocations of the Great GOD, maynt we fear, we shall be laid utterly waste and desolate? Or if the Lord shall yet spare us, maynt we be greatly afraid of having bro't on us that fearful Judgment denounced against Israel after the Lord had sworn He would not forget any of their Sins, and that the Land should tremble for them, see Amos 8. 11, 12. <HI>Behold the days come saith the Lord God, that I will send a Famine in the land, not a Famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord, and they shall wander from Sea to Sea, and from the North, even to the East, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord, and shall not find it.</HI> But if our eyes shall yet see our Teachers, and our ears yet hear the word of Life dispensed to us, have we not

reason to fear, that the Lords Ambassadors shall be sent on that doleful errand the Prophet <HI>Isaiah</HI> was, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> 6.9, 10.</NOTE> <HI>And the Lord said, Go and tell this People, hear ye in∣deed, but understand not, and see ye indeed, but per∣ceive not, make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert, and be healed.</HI> I say, when we reflect on our past unprofitableness and un∣fruitfulness, under the precious means and advantages enjoyed by us, maynt we fear the Lords thus Judicially coming out against us, and causing the means of Grace to have a blinding and hardning efficacy upon us? Mayn't we fear, that some are, and more shall be under such a Judicial dispensation, who have not been, nor are like to be reformed either by Signal Mercies, or Terrible Judgments? May not the Lord say unto this People, as he once did unto <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> when he wept over it, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> 19.42.</NOTE> <HI>Oh that thou hadst known in this thy day, the things that belong to thy peace, but now, they are hid from thine eyes!</HI> What awful Symptoms are there, of blindness, and hardness of heart; Mayn't we fear Men are dreadfully blinded, and hardn'd in their Sins, when there is not so much as an <HI>External Reformation,</HI> by all the <HI>Judgments</HI> of GOD? Are not the very iniquities that have been frequently and so∣lemnly testify'd against by the Lord's Ambassadors, prevailing as much as ever? It was once said, by an Eminent <HI>Divine</HI> of our own, in a <HI>Sermon</HI> on a very Publick and Solemn Occasion.</P>
<P><Q>;THAT there was not a <HI>General Reformation</HI> in respect of so much as any one Evil found amongst us.</Q></P>
<P>IF it be thus still, and we continue going on incor∣rigibly in our evil ways, we may look for a continuance
<PB N="16" REF="002861_0034_0FE679E4BA323D38"/>
of Temporal Judgments, and of shaking dispensations to be trembled at, Amos 8.7, 8. <HI>The Lord hath sworn, surely I will never forget any of their works, shall not the Land tremble for this, and every one mourn that dwelleth therein?</HI> But this may suffice for the confirmation of the <HI>Doctrine,</HI> viz. <HI>That such may be our Condition and Circumstances, that we may have abundant reason to Tremble for fear of GOD, and to be afraid of his Judgments.</HI> And if I am not greatly mistaken, we are in such a Condition, and in such Circumstances <HI>at this day,</HI> as may give us sad Occasion for such Reflections.</P>
<P>I Proceed to make some APPLICATION of these things.</P>
<P>AND here;</P>
<P>USE I. <HI>WE learn from what we have heard, the Astonishing Stupidity, Madness, and Folly of such, as fear not the Lord, nor are afraid of his Judgments.</HI></P>
<P>SINNERS usually mock at GOD'S Judgments, and put the evil day far from them; but did they consider that GOD'S omniscient Eye can find them out, and how his omniscient Arm can punish them, they may justly <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Tremble,</HI> as the Godly <HI>Psalmist</HI> does here. I would fain hope, there's not a Man, Woman, or Child able to reflect upon the Providential dispensa∣tion of GOD towards us, but what have had, and especially since that <HI>lawful Night after the last Sab∣bath,</HI> some concern of Spirit awakned in them, about working out their Salvation with <HI>Fear</HI> and <HI>Trembling,</HI> and thereby preparing for the <HI>coming of the Lord.</HI> Verily, if you cant say that it has been so — you have been exceedingly Stupid, and if you cherish such a frame, you are guilty of the greatest madness &amp; folly, and if you dont fall down before, and give glory to that GOD who has made the Earth to Tremble, and
<PB N="17" REF="002861_0035_0FE679E4DEB05A90"/>
so make Confession of your Sins, and seek earnestly for Peace with him, he may not give you any further Warning, before he executes the fiercness of his Anger upon you. Jer. 5.21, 22. <HI>Hear now this O foolish People; and without understanding, which have eyes, and see not, which have ears, and hear not; Fear ye not me? saith the Lord; will ye not trem∣ble at my presence?</HI></P>
<P>USE II. <HI>WE hence learn, What is the best frame to entertain GOD's Judgments withal.</HI></P>
<P>TO adore the Perfections of the Glorious GOD dis∣play'd in them, to be afraid of them, deeply to resent the Divine displeasure, and humble our selves under his mighty hand, and so stand in awe of him, as to Renounce and Abandon every evil way, and betake our selves to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, as the only City of Refuge; and happy shall they be who do thus <HI>Kiss</HI> the Son of GOD with a kiss of Homage and Sub∣jection, <HI>They shall not perish from the way; when his wrath is kindled, and he is angry, Blessed shall they be who thus put their trust in him</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Psal. 2.12.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>USE III. <HI>LEARN hence, that it is no Cow∣ardize, to be afraid of GOD's Judgments; but very agreable to true Christian Courage.</HI></P>
<P>GOD is no fit match for us to contend withal, <HI>none ever hardn'd themselves against him, and pros∣per'd;</HI> Job 9.3. He is our Creator, we are his Creatures, and are as <HI>Clay in the hand of the Potter;</HI> He is the <HI>King of Kings;</HI> and <HI>Lord of Lords;</HI> GOD cannot miss of his end, as the Princes of this World may, in the execution of their displeasure, thro' im∣potency or want of knowledge; for he is infinite in
<PB N="18" REF="002861_0036_0FE6799B389CB4D0"/>
Knowledge, Wisdom and Power; and there's no com∣parison between Infinite and Finite: It is then no Cowardize to fear GOD: our Saviour <HI>Math.</HI> 10.28. advises us to this <HI>Fear;</HI> and it is agreable to true Christian Courage; this should be express'd in main∣taining a reverential fear of GOD upon our minds, in fighting against the Enemies of our Salvation, in mortifying our lusts, and stedfastly persevering in all the duties of our Holy Religion, and not in disobeying his Commands, and despising his <HI>Judgments,</HI> con∣temning his Rod, and setting our selves in opposition to his Threatnings; this is the most daring and pro∣digious f;olly and madness, and will be found so in the end.</P>
<P>USE IV. WE learn from what we have heard, <HI>The reason of the Lords awful threatning us, as he does at this day.</HI></P>
<P>OUR many provoking Iniquities have been the procuring cause: our evil ways and doings have pro∣cur'd these rebukes from Heaven upon us: We are not humbled even unto this day, neither have we <HI>feared,</HI> nor walked in his Statutes which he set before us, and before our Fathers. Therefore the Lord of Hosts, the GOD of Israel, has set his face against us for evil <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jer.</HI> 44.10, 11.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Wherefore,</P>
<P>V. &amp; lastly. <HI>LET our Flesh now Tremble for fear of GOD, and let us be afraid of his Judgments; and let us once at last hearken to the Exhortation, to Reform and Amend ovr ways and doings, if we would look, or hope to be Sav'd from destroying Judgments.</HI></P>
<P><HI>MY dear Neighbours,</HI> are you <HI>Trembling</HI> this Day <HI>for fear of GOD,</HI> and are you now <HI>afraid of his Judgments?</HI> Are you sensibly touch'd and deeply affected with the Threatning Tokens of the Divine
<PB N="19" REF="002861_0037_0FE679E62DC1CE60"/>
Anger? I am sure, you ought to be so; and if you are not, you are stupid indeed! I hope there are few or none before the Lord now, but are in this Day of fear and concern, serious and thoughtful, what may be the meaning of GOD in this Terrible Dispensation, Surely, the Great GOD is very wroth, and therefore he has been so terribly Shaking the Earth <HI>This Week,</HI> and we may look to feel yet more terrible <HI>Shocks</HI> — if a thorough <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation</HI> prevent not: And this you have been Oh how often exhorted, and urged to, and the Lord who alone knows &amp; searches Hearts, knows how many of You there are, who have never yet comply'd with this <HI>Exhortation,</HI> and have therefore been greatly instrumental of bringing down this unusual Judgment of GOD upon us; and unto such I would now address my self, and with bowels of pity and concern, intreat &amp; beseech them, not to go on any longer in their Sins unrepented of; I would advise such, as they would not be deaf to GOD'S voice this Week unto them, to be <HI>searching their Hearts, and trying their ways;</HI> that you do without any longer delay, take some suitable time, to look within your selves, and to reflect with all possible Seriousness and Solemnity of Spirit, upon all your past evil ways and doings, you are able to bring to your remembrance; and especially mourn for the Carnality, the corruptions and great wickedness of your evil Heart, that <HI>carnal mind</HI> and heart within you, <HI>which is enmity against GOD;</HI> And Oh be perswaded to bring your hard, corrupt, and depraved heart to GOD, for renewing and cleansing, for softning and healing: <HI>to take away your heart of stone, and give you an heart of flesh:</HI> And Oh plead with GOD the gracious promises he has made to do so, unto those who will inquire of, and seek to him for it: And bring unto the Lord, as thy corrupt and wicked Heart, so come to him also with the wickedness of thy Life lying heavy upon thy Heart, by which you
<PB N="20" REF="002861_0038_0FE679EB4C46E220"/>
have dishonour'd GOD, &amp; quenched the Spirit of GOD, and wounded your Soul: Oh let it be with utmost grief, distress and anguish reflected upon; know and see the evil and bitterness of such ways and doings, which your Consciences must tell you, have not been right; abhor your selves before GOD in the remem∣brance of them, judge and condemn your selves be∣fore him, as utterly unworthy of any Mercy or Sal∣vation from him; and having thus mourn'd for your Provocations of GOD, earnestly implore Divine pity and Pardoning Mercy thro' the merits of Christ, for his sake alone; and resolve by the help of Divine grace you will <HI>cast away from you all your transgres∣sions.</HI> Then might you hope to be Sav'd from the Judgments of GOD, or hid under the shadow of his wings untill the heat of his indignation be overpast: By such a <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation,</HI> you may an∣swer the Lords design and end in the <HI>Threatning Dispensation</HI> — you might then have reason to hope that the Lord would <HI>repent him of the evil</HI> which he had tho't yet further to have bro't upon you. Jer. 26.13. <HI>Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the Lord your God, and the Lord will repent him of the evil that he hath pronounced against you.</HI></P>
<P>OH what Encouragement have we then to be humbling our selves before GOD, as we do this day, but what will all our Confessions avail, if we will not forsake as well as confess our Sins: Let each one of us then, from <HI>this day,</HI> set himself to reform and amend every thing that is amiss, every one saying, <HI>What have I done?</HI> And have not I done a great deal, to bring down this new and tremendous Judgment? If we dont with the greatest concern of Soul do so, this will not be an acceptable Day unto the Lord. I trust GOD has a remnant of his reformed and faithful People here, a number of such as tremble at his word, and at his Judgments, Men of a humble &amp; contrite Spirit,
<PB N="21" REF="002861_0039_0FE679EB73648268"/>
Men of Prayer, and of a holy Conversation, who are laying to heart the Sins of the Times, and of the Place in which they live, and who are daily interceeding with GOD for sparing Mercy to a sinful Land: And how many such are there in other Towns &amp; Places doing so, and have been in a very solemn manner this Week <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Day before, all the <HI>Churches</HI> in <HI>Boston</HI> kept a Day of <HI>Fosting</HI> and <HI>Prayer,</HI> and at <HI>Charlestown.</HI></NOTE> and are this Day <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">at <HI>Roxbury</HI> and <HI>Cambridge.</HI></NOTE> Pleading with GOD for Mercy to a sinful People; but whether their in∣tercessions shall prevail, GOD only knows.</P>
<P>OH that this might be a <HI>Day of Attonement</HI> to us, and our Houses, that GOD would hear and answer our Supplications to him, in this time of our distress, while we are trembling before him, and greatly afraid of further terrible manifestations of his holy displeasure. Let us beg of the Lord to shew to us what he would have us to learn &amp; do, by this awful Voice unto us: I hope <HI>(My Neighbours)</HI> this is your great concern this day; I dare not any longer delay Calling You thus together, that we might once more unite in Humbling our selves before GOD, and seeking his face and favour, as not knowing what a Day or a <HI>Night may bring forth:</HI> We are told <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Pet. 3.10.</NOTE> <HI>That the Day of the Lord will come as a Theif in the Night,</HI> which inti∣mates how unexpected it will be, and how surprizing to a secure and wicked World: How frequent and solemn are the exhortations given us in the Gospel to <HI>Watch</HI> and <HI>Pray,</HI> and how awakning are the motives us'd to excite us to do so, see Mark 13.33. <HI>Take ye heed, Watch and Pray, for ye know not when the time is;</HI> and in the 35, &amp; 36. ver. <HI>Watch ye therefore for ye know not when the Master of the House cometh, at evening, or at midnight, or at the Cock crowing, or in the morning, lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping.</HI> What cause have we had to think much upon this <HI>Exhortation</HI> and <HI>Call</HI> of GOD to us since

Well may the People in the <HI>City,</HI> and in the <HI>Country,</HI> be fill'd with the Surprize and Consternation, we see, and hear of; Multitudes seem to be under great Con∣victions, Distress and Concern, about their Souls and Eternity: Oh that the Impressions may abide untill the great work of their saving and thoro' <HI>Conversion</HI> to GOD is accomplish'd!</P>
<P>IT may be, many of us, have not been duly affected with the <HI>Awful Providence</HI> — I trust many of you are now become more thotful about Death, Judgment and Eternity, and the <HI>Speedy coming of the Lord;</HI> And Oh that the Spirit of GOD, might now set home your Convictions, and never leave you, till you are savingly bro't home to GOD.</P>

That we will be now <HI>working out our Sal∣vation with fear and trembling,</HI> make haste to Christ, and so get into good terms with Heaven. Give not sleep to your eyes, nor slumber to your eyelids, till you have sought earnestly a Reconciliation to GOD: GOD may not suffer you to rest quietly if you neglect it.

<P>I will only add, I am greatly afraid, that notwithstand∣ing the Surprize &amp; Consternation many have been and are yet in, because of these <HI>Terrible Earthquakes,</HI> that if they should quickly, wholly cease, many in every place, will Return to their carnal, secure frames again; — What <HI>need</HI> have we then to Cry mightily to GOD, to make the Impressions lasting on the Souls of <HI>Parents,</HI> and <HI>Children, Young</HI> &amp; <HI>Old, Rich</HI> &amp; <HI>Poor, Bond</HI> &amp; <HI>Free!</HI> We have done it already, we will continue to do it, and we hope the Lord will not <HI>turn away our Prayers, nor his Mercy from us.</HI></P>

<P>JUST as the foregoing <HI>Sermon</HI> was committed to the <HI>Press,</HI> I receiv'd the following <HI>Letter</HI> from my worthy Brother, the <HI>Minister</HI> of <HI>Haverhill,</HI> which I cannot but think well worthy of the publick view, and will be a grateful Entertainment to many and to all such especially, who after their sincere <HI>Hu∣miliations</HI> &amp; fervent <HI>Supplications,</HI> are waiting and hoping to see, and hear of gracious answers of <HI>Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>When that GOD with whom is the residue of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> shall pour it out upon the Inhabitants of any place, it is certainly a just cause of great rejoycing.</P>
<P>But while we behold, or hear of such <HI>grace</HI> of GOD, manifested towards such <HI>numbers,</HI> and are <HI>glad,</HI> and are giving to GOD the glory of his free &amp; sovereign grace, in such remarkable effects of it; Let us earnestly pray, that <HI>their goodness may not be as the morning cloud, and early dew that soon goeth away; that they may with purpose of heart cleave unto the Lord: That as they have received Christ Jesus the Lord, so they may walk in Him, and be stablished in the faith: that they may stand fast in the Lord:</HI> That the <HI>Spirit</HI> of GOD may fast'n the convictions, and impressions made upon their hearts, and make them a <HI>People ready and prepared for the Lord:</HI> And that there may be joy in Heaven, and upon Earth, at seeing hopeful <HI>Symptoms</HI> of a <HI>true Re∣pentance,</HI> and <HI>thorough Reformation,</HI> upon yet many more there, and in other places.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="002861_0044_0FE679F7D6E36BB8"/>Would to <HI>GOD</HI> we might have reason to call upon others, as they do on us, to glorify GOD for re∣markable Convictions &amp; deep Impressions— on the hearts of <HI>Parents</HI> &amp; <HI>Children</HI> among us, and in our Neighbourhood; and consequent hereon, a flocking of many to the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> as of <HI>Doves</HI> to their windows <HI>asking the way to Zion with their faces thitherward,</HI> and saying, <HI>come and let us join our selves to the Lord in a perpetual covenant that shall never be forgotten,</HI> and to the Church &amp; People of GOD, and by due approaches to <HI>Christ</HI> at his <HI>Table,</HI> prepare for his <HI>Coming.</HI></P>
<P>Let the grace of GOD shewn to others, encourage even the <HI>chief of Sinners,</HI> under their Convictions, to cry mightily to GOD, that the like free and Sovereign Grace may be glorify'd towards them.</P>
<P>If the Impressions should wear off, and such should return to, and go on in their foolish &amp; hurtful ways again, there will be less hope than ever, of their <HI>Re∣formation</HI> and <HI>Conversion.</HI></P>
<P>If the late terrible EARTHQUAKE dont stir Men up to <HI>amend their ways and doings,</HI> and <HI>Return unto the Lord;</HI></P>

<SALUTE>Rev. and Dear Brother.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Have wanted very much to write to, and hear from you, ever since the first <HI>Earthquakes</HI> but I think, have scarce had time to write. The <HI>Earthquakes</HI> as far as I can hear, were much more terrible hereabouts than with you; I think there has not the space of 24 Hours past, since the <HI>First,</HI> but we have heard them.</P>
<P>As to the Damage done by them, I suppose you may have had a better Account than I can give, they say it has broke the Ground in many places in <HI>Newbury;</HI> in our <HI>Town</HI> I think no such thing has been observ'd, but only shaking down Tops of Chimneys, shattering some Brick Houses, and shaking others so as to throw Pewter off the Shelves, make Andirons jump off the Hearth, throw down Stone Wall, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In our House it stop'd our Clock just half an Hour past 10. P. M.</P>
<P>We were in Bed, and I han't time to tell you how much we were surpriz'd, and indeed almost all the good People, as well as bad in the <HI>Town.</HI></P>
<P>But something of the deep &amp; (I hope) <HI>good</HI> Im∣pressions it has made on us, I think my self concern'd in honour to our SAVIOUR to relate.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002861_0046_0FE679FE3819FBF8"/>The next Day <HI>Oct.</HI> 30. We kept a Publick <HI>Fast,</HI> and had an extraordinary full Meeting, from all parts of the Town, 6 Miles distance, at 2 or 3 Hours warn∣ing; I Preach'd from Isaiah 26.21. <HI>For behold, the Lord cometh out of his place to punish the Inhabitants of the earth for their Iniquity:</HI> We were very earnest and enlarged in Prayer, which seemed to be <HI>a Token for good:</HI> The next <HI>Wednesday,</HI> (the Earthquakes still continuing) we kept another Fast, had 2 Meet∣ings very full, with only giving notice in the Morn∣ing: Mr. <HI>Parsons</HI> of <HI>Bradford,</HI> preach'd in the fore∣noon from Isa. 27.9. <HI>By this therefore shall the in∣iquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit to take away his sin:</HI> which I hope will be fulfill'd. I preach'd in the afternoon from Isa. 26.9. <HI>With my Soul have I desired thee in the night, yea, with my spirit within me will I seek the early: for when thy Judgments are in the earth, the Inhabitants of the World will learn righteousness.</HI> We were again very much assisted, &amp; enlarged, and the Congregation the most affected that ever I saw. On <HI>Thursday,</HI> we met &amp; pray'd at <HI>Bradford:</HI> from thence to Saturday Night, I was fully employ'd in discoursing People about their Souls — by night &amp; day. On the Lord's Day, <HI>Nov.</HI> 5. I preach'd on Hosea 11.8, 9. <HI>How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned with∣in me, my repentings are kindled together. I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger,</HI> &amp;c. Not any further to Alarm, but <HI>melt</HI> our Hearts into Repentance: The same Day, some Persons that stood Propounded to own the Covenant, were now forthwith admitted to <HI>full Communion,</HI> and above 30 Persons more were propounded.</P>
<P>And all the Week before &amp; after <HI>Thanksgiving,</HI> I was still full of Company, <HI>rain</HI> or <HI>shine;</HI> some Days
<PB N="5" REF="002861_0047_0FE679FE5F7FBC68"/>
from Morning till 8 a Clock at Night, without so much as time to take any bodily refreshment. (I had but a few Hours intermission for making my <HI>Thanks∣giving</HI> Sermon, from Psal. 65.1 <HI>Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall the vow be performed.</HI>) The next Sabbath <HI>Nov.</HI> 12. we had pro∣pounded 84 Persons; and again Yesterday <HI>Nov.</HI> 19. (for my hands were full the 3d week) 39. and Peo∣ple are still coming to me. So that now, since the <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> I have admitted and propounded 154 Persons; 87 for the Lords Table, the rest for Baptism, or the Renewing their Baptismal Covenant: The number of Men &amp; Women pretty near equal; mostly younger People, from 15 to 30, some upwards. And they that own the Covenant the bigger part unmarried Persons.</P>
<P>Besides these a great many that have not knowledge enough to make any Profession, yet now gladly come to enquire, <HI>What they shall do to be saved?</HI> And I never saw better Symptoms of <HI>Conversion,</HI>— Persons so deeply affected, and seemingly humbl'd for their Sins; and tho' many of them were thoughtful, &amp; I trust something experienc'd in Piety before, yet I can't but think, some have been immediately converted in this Time of the EARTHQUAKES. Some that were the worst of <HI>Drunkards, Swearers,</HI> often blaspheming GOD, and others the most loose Livers, are bro't to their Knees, humbled to the dust, melted into tears, and seemingly the profoundest resolutions for a new Life. There seems to be in the Town, a <HI>General Re∣formation.</HI> Profaness restrain'd, Family Worship set up even in the most unlikely Houses, the Publick Wor∣ship attended with earnestness; Young Men's Meetings multiply, and increase, Family meetings set up, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and Christians generally awakn'd, and seem to have quite another view of this &amp; the other World.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002861_0048_0FE67A003610A320"/>It has look'd in short, as if we were going into a <HI>New World;</HI> which things have occasion'd in me various thoughts — and been as surprizing as the <HI>Earthquakes.</HI></P>
<P>I've just now on this occasion been looking over the additions made to our Church heretofore; and I find of 109 Persons that have owned the Covenant, since my Ministry, 54 of them have done it since last <HI>May</HI> was twelve-month, and above 20 Young Persons unmarried, in the Summer past. And of 130 Persons admitted to the Lords Table from 1719. till these Earthquakes, 30 of them have been admitted within a Year past, which is 3 times so many as in any one Year before, except the first Year of my Ministry, in which I admitted 32. So that we have for some time past been growing &amp; ripening for this <HI>Harvest.</HI></P>
<P>I need not make any reflections to you, on these things, I want very much to hear what effects the awful visitation has had near, and about you, and what are the thoughts of the most Judicious about the <HI>Signs of the Times.</HI></P>
<P>I beg of you to send me the best accounts, and com∣municate this where you think proper; That they may Glorify GOD for our professed Subjection to the Gospel of <HI>Christ,</HI> and by their Prayers for such a miserable, sinful People, as in general we have been.</P>
<P>The Account I have given is in a degree (propor∣tionably) true, as far as I can learn, of the Towns hereabouts, considering how much less reason they have had, to be Humbled and Reformed than We.</P>
<P>At <HI>Exeter</HI> I heard a Week ago, there had been 40 Persons Baptis'd since the EARTHQUAKE: At <HI>Almsbury</HI> (as one inform'd me,) they seem'd as if they were willing to spend their whole time in the <HI>Wor∣ship</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="002861_0049_0FE67A005C805B30"/>
of GOD. Tho' too remarkably backward and slothful in duty before.</P>
<P>But I have been so busy at home, I've heard but very little from abroad; But after all, among <HI>Us,</HI> the Impression is not so General, but there are some, alas too many, remaining to appearance just where they were, in their former security, a Generation in their declining age, <HI>settled on their Lees,</HI> (a proof of the Sovereign Grace of GOD in effecting these things among us,) <HI>The Lord have Mercy on them.</HI></P>
<P>Begging your Prayers, the Impressions &amp; Convicti∣ons made on so many, may Issue in a <HI>Repentance unto Salvation not to be repented of,</HI> and that we may be Prepared for all future events of <HI>Providence,</HI> yea, and for the <HI>Coming of the Day of GOD:</HI></P>
