<P><HI>[To the tune of Major ANDRE.]</HI></P>
<LG N="1">
<HEAD>1</HEAD>
<L>COME, you redeemed of the Lord,</L>
<L>Give ear to my complaint,</L>
<L>And hear the sorrows of my soul,</L>
<L>Which tongue nor pen can't paint.</L>
<L>You're happy, happy, in the Lord,</L>
<L>Secure from death and hell;</L>
<L>But who can tell, but God alone,</L>
<L>Where my poor soul must dwell?</L>
</LG>

<HEAD>2</HEAD>
<L>Sometimes my heart is prompt to say,</L>
<L>No sorrows like to mine;</L>
<L>Yet reason whispers, peace, be still,</L>
<L>There's sorrows more sublime.</L>
<L>The Lord of Glory suffer'd more</L>
<L>Than human tongue can tell;</L>
<L>But who can tell, but God alone,</L>
<L>Where my poor soul must dwell?</L>

<HEAD>3</HEAD>
<L>Once I could sin, and tempt the Lord,</L>
<L>And feel no dread within;</L>
<L>I thought I almost was secure,</L>
<L>But now and then a sting.</L>
<L>But O! alas! I found myself</L>
<L>Just on the brink of hell,</L>
<L>And then I thought it was decreed,</L>
<L>Where my poor must dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">

<L>O, the sharp pangs my soul did feel,</L>
<L>For crimes which I had done;</L>
<L>I had provok<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d a dreadful God,</L>
<L>My sorrows then begun.</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="036909_0003_100B54F795E74CC0"/>
To Sinai's fiery mount I flew,</L>
<L>My horrid tale to tell,</L>
<L>But God in thunder there proclaim'd</L>
<L>Where my poor <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> I must dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>5</HEAD>
<L>I cried, O Lord, thy law is good,</L>
<L>Thy sentence just and right;</L>
<L>Why have I not been crush'd before,</L>
<L>And doom'd to endless night.</L>
<L>But Lord, I cried, what shall I do?</L>
<L>A victim there I fell,</L>
<L>And left it all with God, to doom</L>
<L>Where my poor soul must dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>6</HEAD>
<L>Stern justice stared me in the face,</L>
<L>While I for mercy cried;</L>
<L>At length on Calvary <HI>I</HI> view'd</L>
<L>A Saviour crucified,</L>
<L>Sweet Jesus whisper'd in my heart,</L>
<L>And this glad news did tell,</L>
<L>Your sins are washed in my blood,</L>
<L>Your soul with me shall dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>7</HEAD>
<L>O matchless love! my soul did cry,</L>
<L>How can this all be true;</L>
<L>Which makes me Abba Father cry,</L>
<L>And bid the world adieu.</L>
<L><HI>I</HI> mounted up toward the sky,</L>
<L>And left all earth and hell,</L>
<L>And saw the glorious resting place,</L>
<L>Where my poor soul must dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="8">
<HEAD>8</HEAD>
<L>I thought <HI>I</HI> heard my Jesus say</L>
<L>Go, tell the world the news;</L>
<L>My soul with raptures then replied,</L>
<L>Yea, Lord, I'll not refuse.</L>
<L>But O, alas! my pride return'd,</L>
<L>I was ashamed to tell,</L>
<L>And then I was in doubt again,</L>
<L>Where my poor soul should dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>9</HEAD>
<L>Thus I went mourning night and day,</L>
<L>To God I sent my cry;</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="036909_0004_100B54FA72B4DD90"/>
That he would let me know his will,</L>
<L>Wishing that I could die:</L>
<L>But all the answer <HI>I</HI> receiv'd,</L>
<L>Was, I've reveal'd my will,</L>
<L>That you go forth, and tell the world,</L>
<L>Where their poor souls must dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>10</HEAD>
<L>You are a witness, saith the Lord,</L>
<L>My counsels to declare;</L>
<L>Gird up your loins and face the field,</L>
<L>You see the harvest near.</L>
<L>Shake off your doubts, the fields are white,</L>
<L>And thus to sinners tell,</L>
<L>Unless they do repent and turn.</L>
<L>Where their poor souls must dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>11</HEAD>
<L>Lord I'm a child, <HI>I</HI> cannot go,</L>
<L>My counsels they'll despise;</L>
<L>Besides my weakness and my fears,</L>
<L>No learning to suffice.</L>
<L>Thus I refus'd to bear the cross,</L>
<L>Resolving to rebel,</L>
<L>'Till I in darkness cried, who knows</L>
<L>Where my poor soul must dwell?</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<HEAD>12</HEAD>
<L>Then <HI>I</HI> a voyage to Tarshish took,</L>
<L>And thus my Lord denied;</L>
<L>And in a dreadful sleep was found</L>
<L>Along by the ships side;</L>
<L>Where dashing waves or'erwhelm'd my soul,</L>
<L>That I should thus rebel;</L>
<L>Ah! who can tell, was all my cry,</L>
<L>Where my poor soul must dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>13</HEAD>
<L>And then like Saul, the son of Kish,</L>
<L>The kingdom <HI>I</HI> had lost;</L>
<L>Like Esau, I had lost my right,</L>
<L>And many a tear it cost,</L>
<L>Then I resolv'd to bear the cross,</L>
<L>No longer to rebel,</L>
<L>And left it all with God alone,</L>
<L>Where my poor soul must dwell.</L>

<HEAD>14</HEAD>
<L>But here's the greatest trial I find,</L>
<L>The worst of all my fear,</L>
<L>That I should run before I'm sent,</L>
<L>Like Balaam son of Beor:</L>
<L>And shall not profit where I go,</L>
<L>Although the truth I tell;</L>
<L>Which makes me cry, ah! who can tell,</L>
<L>Where my poor soul must dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<HEAD>15</HEAD>
<L>Come tell me, you that love the Lord,</L>
<L>Come make your sorrows known;</L>
<L>Have you such trials in your minds,</L>
<L>Or am <HI>I</HI> thus alone?</L>
<L>I long to know how Christians feel;</L>
<L>But if you do not tell,</L>
<L>Yet I will seek a resting place,</L>
<L>Where my poor soul must dwell.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="16">
<HEAD>16</HEAD>
<L>Thus <HI>I</HI> will face a frowning world,</L>
<L>And set my face like flint;</L>
<L>Come you that love a Jesus slain,</L>
<L>We'll join in one consent.</L>
<L>We soon shall see that solemn day,</L>
<L>When death shall end the spell,</L>
<L>Where we shall see as we are seen,</L>
<L>Our souls with Christ shall dwell.</L>
</LG>

<L>Glory to God the Father be,</L>
<L>Glory to God the Son,</L>
<L>And to the Spirit equal praise,</L>
<L>The sacred Three in One.</L>
<L>Let angels praise the triune God,</L>
