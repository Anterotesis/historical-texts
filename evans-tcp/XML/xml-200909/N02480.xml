<P><HI>THe Decree in this Cause contains the Bill of Complaint and the Defendants Answer both at length, the Bill being 173 Sheets, and the Answer 199 Sheets, which was done because the Defendants, by their Council, insisted on having the Answer at length, and therefore the Complainants insisted, in like manner, on having their Bill at length, incerted in the Decree.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Cause depending on the Construction of Deeds, the Court thought it proper that the Deeds should be taken in at length, in order that it might always appear whether the Construction, put upon them by the Court, be just, and that there might be no pretence of Deceit, in taking in Paragraphs which make one way, and leaving out the Paragraphs thereof which make the contrary way.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That part of the</HI> Decree <HI>which contains the material Deeds, and the Construction that the Court put upon them, is in the words following,</HI></P>
<P>ANd this Cause then standing in Court upon <HI>Bill</HI> and <HI>Answer,</HI> the twenty eighth day of <HI>April</HI> last, was appointed by this Court for the Hearing thereof: On which Day the same coming to be heard and debated accordingly, in presence of Council learned on both sides, the substance of the <HI>Complainants</HI> Bill, and the <HI>Defendants</HI> Answer, appeared to be as herein before set forth; and the material Writings confessed, discovered and referred to, by the <HI>Defendants</HI> Answer, appeared to be in these words,</P>

<PB N="12" REF="002940_0012_0FE69B8DE19B93A0"/>and interest, agreed to be paid to the Complainants, that the Consideration on the Complainants part to be done, was, First, <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to make further Proffers for the West-Neck,</HI> and Secondly, <HI>By the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> to write to their Correspondents, to desist;</HI> the performance of both which is ex∣presly averred by the Bill, and no way denyed, but confessed by the Answer. That as to what's alledged on this point, in behalf of the Defendents, viz. <HI>That the Complainants had Circumvented and Surprized them is the Agreement, and had deceived them, by sending the first Letter by</HI> Quinby, Cornwall, <HI>and</HI> Townsend, <HI>under pretence that they had Correspondents, when the Defendents alledge, they had none, by which they were damnified.</HI> It appears, <HI>the Defend∣ents had the Articles in their hands for two days before the Execution thereof,</HI> and the Complainants are but Illiterate, and the Defendants men of Figure and Knowledge, which leaves little room to suspect either Surprize or Circum∣vention on the part of the Complainants. That <HI>its not affirmed by the Answer, That</HI> Quinby, Cornwall <HI>and</HI> Townsend said, <HI>they particuarly had Correspond∣ents,</HI> but by their Letter, <HI>it appears they wrote not to them as such,</HI> but as to <HI>the Correspondents of the</HI> Palmers, <HI>and Company,</HI> and <HI>that they had Correspond∣ents, is admitted,</HI> That by the Second Article of Agreement, in the Defendent, Philips's writing, which was proposed and agreed to, after the first Letter was sent away, it appears, <HI>the Letter agreed to be sent, was then to be sent,</HI> which <HI>Could not be that which had been before Sent;</HI> and <HI>which Letter is acknowleged to have been received by the Defendents,</HI> and <HI>which, with the Desisting to make further Proffers,</HI> is a Performance of what, on the Complainants part was to be Performed; and if any room is left to suppose Surprize or Circumvention, in sending the first Letter, it seemeth not sufficient to make void the Argeement, it not being the Substance of the Matter, but <HI>the desisting further Proffers</HI> with <HI>the Second Letter by the</HI> Palmers, remain sufficient Considerations for Perform∣ance on the part of the Defendents; these being all that appear to be stipulated to be done on the part of the Complainants.</P>
<P>Then as to the <HI>Bounds of the Great or midle Neck,</HI> which is the Chief thing in question, I conceive what appears in the Defendents Answer, and has been urged by them, <HI>as to the meaning of the word Neck,</HI> in the Mortgage of <HI>Richbell</HI> to <HI>Richbell,</HI> under which the Complainants now claim, that it extends no fur∣ther than the flux of the Salt-Water: I conceive it to be an Exposition which will neither agree with the words of the Patent, nor Deeds that are set forth, referred to, and produced either by the Complainants or Defendents, nor with the Intention of the Parties to the Deeds themselves. It has been strongly insisted on by the Defendents Council, that the word <HI>Neck</HI> is a plain familiar English word, and easy to be understood, and that it means not nor can mean any more than <HI>a point of Land, limitted or bounded with Water on three Sides,</HI> and can bear the Name of a <HI>Neck</HI> no further than the Water makes it so, that is, where the Tyde rises; and <HI>that the words in the Patent, and all the Deeds contain two several Grants,</HI> to wit, <HI>One of the Necks,</HI> and <HI>another of the Land, without the Necks, running into the Woods.</HI> Now, whatever there might be in this Ex∣position of the word <HI>Neck,</HI> standing singly by it self, which yet I do not think will hold; for it is well known, that Valleys between two or more Ridges of Higher ground, far beyond where the Neck reaches, in common acceptation, do as frequently fall under the Denomination of <HI>Necks</HI> of Land, as the other: But leaving that, I say, whatever the word <HI>Neck,</HI> singly standing by it self, might signify in the case before me, at present, I conceive, <HI>it must be understood as the Words of the Patent and Deeds of the Grantor describes and intended it.</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="002940_0013_0FE69B8E42D80ED0"/>It will not be denyed, but that Names both of Places and Things are arbitrary, even tho' very false, as <HI>Black and White Acre,</HI> which do not receive thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Names from their <HI>Colour,</HI> and yet when things obtain such a Name, by reputa∣tion, they will pass by these Names. A piece of Painting, taking in that part of the body above the middle, and so in <HI>Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ts,</HI> has obtained the Name of <HI>a Head,</HI> and is so called, <HI>tho' we see it takes in the Neck, shoulders, and a great part of the Body;</HI> so it may well be that the extent or bounds of a Piece of Land, can∣not always be gathered, nor clearly understood by the Name which is given it. It is Evident, that in the original Grant or Patent of this Land it is described to be 

 <Q>A parcel or Tract of Land, contained within three Necks, the Easter-most of which is bounded with a small River, called, <HI>Mamaroneck River,</HI> being the Easter-most Limits or Bounds of this Government, and the Wester-most, by the Gravelly or stony Brook or River, which makes the Ester-most Bounds of Mr. <HI>Pells</HI> Purchase, having to the South the Sound, and running North-ward from the marked Trees upon the said Necks, twen∣ty Miles into the Woods.</Q>

 This <HI>parcel or Tract of Land,</HI> it is plain, is described under the Name of <HI>one Tract only,</HI> having the Sound to the South∣ward, and <HI>running North-ward Twenty Miles into the Woods;</HI> which is the same as to say, <HI>being bounded to the South-ward with the Sound,</HI> and <HI>to the North-ward at the Extent of Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> It is further Ob∣serveable, That in the same Patent, it is granted by the Name of <HI>One parcel or Tract of Land only,</HI> and in the <HI>Habend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m,</HI> there it is called the said <HI>Parcel and Tract of Land in the said Three Necks contained,</HI> and a yearly Quit-Rent of Eight bushel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of Wheat, is reserved upon <HI>the same Tract of Land.</HI> So, I think, by the Patent, there is no doubt but the whole was called and understood to be <HI>One Tract of Land, contained in three Necks.</HI> And who can say, the Grantor had not a right to extend these Necks of Land by the Name of <HI>Necks,</HI> as far back into the Woods as he thought fit. But the Second Deed produced and agreed to by both Parties, is a deed made by the Patentee <HI>John Richbell,</HI> about one year after the Date of the Patent, and is a Grant of the Easter-most of the said three <HI>Necks,</HI> to one <HI>Rider,</HI> in trust for a Joynture, to the Grantor <HI>John Richbell's Wife.</HI> Now by this Deed, it is evident, that as the said Tract of Land <HI>was granted or patented by the name of three necks,</HI> so the Grantee or Patentee, under∣stood it, &amp; so he calls it; for in this Deed of <HI>Riders,</HI> he discribes it by the Name of a certain <HI>tract or parcel of Land upon the Main, containing three necks,</HI> &amp; granted for the uses in the said Deed mention'd, all that <HI>parcel or tract of Land where be now lives, called the East-Neck;</HI> &amp; to leave it without doubt, what he means by <HI>neck,</HI> he says, <HI>the Neck includes all the Lands, as well North into the Woods above</HI> Westchester <HI>Path, Twenty Miles, as the Lands below the Path, South-wards towards the Sound.</HI> And after having so described the <HI>Neck</HI> in the Premisses of the Deed, so in the <HI>Habendum,</HI> he calls it, without the addition of more words, <HI>The said Neck of Land.</HI> And in the Covenant, for further assurance, he calls it by the same Name of <HI>Neck</HI> only. From all which, it is plain, to a Demonstration, that the Grantor, <HI>John Richbell,</HI> meant and understood by the word <HI>Neck</HI> of Land, <HI>all the Land between the Sound on the South-ward, and the Extent of Twenty Miles to the North-ward.</HI> And looking into the Deed of Mortgage, as us Steenwyck, about five years after date of the Patent, under which Mortgage the Defendents claim, and is by them set forth and referred to, in their Answer, we find the said <HI>John Richbell</HI> for the securing the pay∣ment of Two Thousand Four Hundred Guilders, Wampon (which is worth Sixty Pounds <HI>York Money</HI>) did 

 
 <Q>Bind his the said <HI>John Richbell</HI>'s Neck or
 <PB N="14" REF="002940_0014_0FE69B9B979110D8"/>piece of Land lying upon the Main, being the most Westerly Neck of Land of the three, to him the said <HI>John Richbell</HI> belonging, Limitting the Neck of Land aforesaid, to the South, with the Sound, and running from the marked T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es standing on the said Necks, Twenty Miles into the Woods.</Q>

 
 
Here he again tells us what he understood the said <HI>Neck</HI> to be, and which is contained in as certain words as can well be expressed. And so, it appears, he had Granted or Mortgaged <HI>both the East and West Necks,</HI> as they are described in the Patent, <HI>bounded on the Sound to the South-ward, and running Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> But then, as to the Deed or Mortgage of the same, <HI>John Richbell</HI> to his Uncle <HI>Robert Richbell,</HI> made about Seven Years after the Date of the Patent, for securing the payment of Two Hundred and Fifty Pounds, Boston Silver Money, which at that time was equal in Value to Six Shillings and Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Pence <HI>per Ounce,</HI> by which he grants 

 
 <Q>all his Right, Title and Interest in and to One Neck of Land commonly called and known by the Name of the great Neck, bordered or bounded by the Sound on one End, &amp; betwixt his other two small Necks, on each side of the great Neck, To have and To hold <HI>the said great neck.</HI></Q>

 
 
And thus stand the words of this Deed, and upon which the whole Dispute, at present, is. The Defendants say, That here <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o more passeth but what nature makes a Neck, <HI>because the Extent of Twenty Miles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the woods, is not Expressed, therefore it shall not be intended to pass;</HI> &amp; that wherever the grantor, <HI>John Richbell,</HI> intended twenty Miles should pass, he said so, &amp; so ex∣pressed it. And here they urge strongly, That this <HI>Grant of a parcel or tract of Land, contained in three necks having the Sound is the South-ward, &amp; running twenty Miles into the Woods, makes two Different Grants of two several parcels of Land;</HI> and say further, that the words <HI>parcel or Tract of Land,</HI> should be read, <HI>parcel &amp; Tract of Land;</HI> and so by changing the Disjunctive into a Conjunctive, it will then be clear, that <HI>the grant of the Twenty Miles into the Woods, from the marked Trees on the said Necks, is a seperate Tract of Land,</HI> and cannot pass by the word <HI>Neck,</HI> which is a Distinct <HI>parcel of Land,</HI> unless mentioned. And so, by the Mortgage, under which the Complainants claim, nothing can pass but the Land lying between the <HI>Two Creeks,</HI> as high as the Salt-Water flows; And to sup∣port this Exposition, they product a third Mortgage of the said West-Neck, set forth and referred to by them in their Answers, and made by the said <HI>John Richbell</HI> in One Thousand Six Hundred and Seventy Eight, to the same <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck,</HI> for the securing of One Hundred and Twenty Five Pounds. And by this Mortgage Deed, they say, that <HI>John Richbell</HI> granted the same <HI>West-Neck,</HI> and also <HI>Twenty Miles into the Woods;</HI> and from thence urge, That as be intended to grant: <HI>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> so he took care to express it accordingly. The words of the Deed are these, 
 
 <Q>Hath Demised, Granted, &amp;c. to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck</HI> all that his Neck of Land lying upon the Main, being the most Westerly Neck of the three, belong∣ing to the said <HI>John Richbell,</HI> the said Neck of Land bordering on the stoney or gravelly Water or River, which is the East-Limits of Mr. <HI>Pells</HI> Land, and having to the South side, the Sound, and running from the marked Tree, which is on the said Neck, North-ward, Twenty Miles into the Woods.</Q>


 
Now, say they, it is plain, that in the grant of the <HI>East-Neck,</HI> and in both the before-mentioned Grants of the <HI>West-Neck,</HI> as he intended to grant the <HI>Necks</HI> with the <HI>other Tracts of Land Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> so he Expressed it: But, as in the Grant of the <HI>Middle Neck,</HI> Nothing is <HI>Expressed</HI> but the <HI>bare Neck,</HI> so nothing shall be intended to pass, but the <HI>Neck only;</HI> which they say, is an easy and natural Exposition of the word <HI>Neck,</HI> and fully
<PB N="15" REF="002940_0015_0FE69B9BB4E5E2A8"/>Expresses the Intention of Grantor, and crave great Allowances for the Igno∣rance of the times, when there were few or none that understood Clerkship, or the art of Conveyancing. Then, to corroberate this, they set forth in their Answer, that some of the Complainants themselves so understood the word <HI>Neck,</HI> and offered to take a Lease from the Defendent <HI>Philipse,</HI> of part of the Land they now claim. And as a further argument to prove that the Complainants have no Right to any part of the Lands in <HI>John Richbells</HI> Patent, except the Lands in the <HI>great Neck, as far as the Salt-Water flows,</HI> they produce the Deeds of Lease and Release of the said <HI>John Richbells</HI> Heir, to the Com∣plainants, bearing Date the Eighth Day of <HI>Feburary,</HI> 1722. in which Release the Mortgage of the <HI>great Neck,</HI> by <HI>John Richbell</HI> to <HI>Edward Richbell,</HI> made in One Thousand Six Hundred and Seventy Three, is recited, and the great Neck is there exactly described, as it is in the said Mortgage, and so from thence conclude, That the Heir of <HI>John Richbell,</HI> granting only the great Neck, as being "Bounded to the South-ward with the Sound, and lying between <HI>"John Richbells</HI> other two small Necks, "Nothing can pass but what nature makes a Neck. And then, the same Defendents produce their own Deeds of Lease and Release from the same <HI>Edward Richbell,</HI> Heir of <HI>John Richbell,</HI> Dated the Twelfth and Thirteenth Days of <HI>August,</HI> One Thousand Seven Hundred and Twenty Three to these Defendants, for all the residue of <HI>John Richbells</HI> Lands, contained in the before mentioned Patent, except the <HI>great Neck,</HI> before released to the Complainants, or some of them, and by virtue of this, the De∣fendants say, they have a good Right to all the Lands <HI>above the Natural Neck Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> But I can, by no means, be of the Defendents Opinion, as to the meaning of the word <HI>Neck,</HI> nor allow of such a Change of words, where there is not an absolute Necessity, as in this case there is not; Nay, I think such a Change of words cannot be admitted, without making the Patent and the other Deeds contradict themselves; for when the Grantor him∣self takes so much pains, when he goes about to grant one of these <HI>Necks</HI> of Land, to limit, Describe, and in express words, to call it a <HI>Neck of Land,</HI> and so to describe its Bounds and Extent, it would be a very great Violence done to the Intention of the Grantor, to change his words, in order either to Di∣minish or to Enlarge his Grant, without some apparent Necessity or Reason for so doing, upon the bare supposition of his not intending the <HI>great Neck</HI> should extend as far as the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West Necks,</HI> because it is only called <HI>his great Neck lying between his other two small Necks.</HI> I say, this would, in my Opinion, be changeing both the Words and Intent of the Grantor; for by the Second Mortgage of the Reversion of the <HI>great Neck</HI> and <HI>West-Neck</HI> to one <HI>Kellond,</HI> under which the Complainants do also Claim, in One Thousand Six Hundred and Seventy Six, for the security of One Hundred Pounds, Discover∣ed and referred to by the Defendents, in their Answer, It is manifest, that he understood the <HI>West-Neck</HI> and the <HI>great Neck</HI> to be of the same Extent; for having before Mortgaged the <HI>great Neck</HI> to <HI>Robert Richbell,</HI> without adding the words <HI>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> and also to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck,</HI> his <HI>West-Neck, with these words Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> In this Mortgage to <HI>Kellond,</HI> of the Reversion of the <HI>two Necks,</HI> to wit, the <HI>great and West-Necks,</HI> he there recites that 
 
 <Q>Whereas he had granted to <HI>Robert Richbell</HI> his <HI>Neck</HI> of Land, commonly called, his <HI>great Neck,</HI> for Ninety Nine years, for the securing the payment of Two Hundred and Fifty Pounds, and had granted to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck</HI> his <HI>West-Neck</HI> for securing the payment of Two Thousand Four Hundred Guilders,</Q>

 he there grants <HI>the Reversion of the said</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="002940_0016_0FE69B9E96BBFDF8"/><HI>Two necks of Land</HI> to the said <HI>Kellond,</HI> without any addition or Description, but that of the <HI>Necks</HI> only, tho' it is mainfest, that in the Mortgage of the <HI>West-Neck</HI> to <HI>Steenwyck,</HI> here referred to, in this Mortgage, the words <HI>Twenty Miles are contained;</HI> yet when he comes here to mention, that he has formerly Mortga∣ged it, he calls it <HI>only by the Name of his West-Neck,</HI> and thinks this a full De∣scription. And why as much should not be understood here by <HI>great Neck,</HI> as by <HI>West-Neck,</HI> I have not yet heard a Reason. And were I at a loss to find out the mind of the Grantor, there is yet a <HI>Consideration,</HI> which in this Court will always have great weight, and that is, 
 <Q>To make such Construction of Deeds, when the words will bear it, and such Exposition does not break in upon any known Rule of Law, that no party may be hurt by the Construc∣tion.</Q>

 Now it is plain to me, that to confine the word <HI>Neck</HI> in the manner the Defendents would have it; then <HI>Robert Richbell</HI> had not a Security for a fifth part of the Money by him advanced. It is said by the Complainants, and owned by the Defendents, that the Neck, in the sense the Defendents contend for, contains not above <HI>Three hundred &amp; twenty Acres of Land, the Fee-Simple whereof, at the time of the Mortgage, as the Complainants charge, was not worth above Seventy Pounds, Money of</HI> New-York, <HI>it being a New Country,</HI> &amp; <HI>but very few Inhabitants.</HI> Now, shall it be supposed, that when <HI>John Richbell</HI> Mortgaged the Fee-simple of the <HI>west-neck, running Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck</HI> for <HI>Sixty Pounds,</HI> that he intended that a term of <HI>Ninety Nine years, in a fort<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth part of that Quantity of Land,</HI> as a good security for <HI>Two Hundred</HI> and <HI>Fifty Pounds,</HI> it is unreasonable to suppose it; besides, it appears that <HI>John Rich∣bell</HI> wanted more Money, and was Obliged to Mortgage the Reversion of both the <HI>great and west-neck</HI> for a term of Ninety Nine Years, to commence after the first Mortgages upon these two <HI>Necks</HI> were cleared off. Now, can it be easily supposed, if that part of the <HI>great Neck running Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> had not been Mortgaged, that <HI>Kellond</HI> would have left that, and ac∣cepted so mean a security as a term of Ninety Nine Years, in the Reversion of <HI>the great and West-Neck,</HI> after the term of Ninety Nine Years should be ex∣pired, or the Sum of two Hundred and Fifty Pounds, and Two Thousand four Hundred Guilders, and Interest, should be paid, when he well knew, that no Lands at that time in these parts, would let for any annual Rent at all. I say, these are Improbabilities, and may only be possible; but it is the more Rational Conclusion, that <HI>John Richbell</HI> and <HI>Mr. Kellond</HI> well Knowing <HI>both the whole great neck and west-neck to be Mortgaged, and that</HI> John <HI>having settled his East-neck for a Jointure on his Wife, he had then nothing left but to give a Second Mortgage on all that he had,</HI> which was the Reversion of his <HI>great and West-Neck.</HI> Then, as to what was urged by the Complainants, upon reading of the third Mortgage of <HI>Richbell</HI> to <HI>Steenwyck,</HI> under which the Defendents also claim the <HI>West-Neck,</HI> I cannot conclude with them, that be∣cause in this Mortgage neither the Mortgagor, nor the Mortgagee have taken any Notice of any former Mortgage being upon the West-Neck, and that the Mortgagor hath also 

 <Q>Covenanted, That the same shall be peaceably held and enjoyed by the Mortgagee, his Heirs, Executors, Administrators &amp; Assigns, freed and Discharged from all other and former Bargains and Sales, &amp;c.</Q>

 I say, I cannot presume, as the Complainants insist, that the former Mortgage of the West-Neck, to <HI>Steenwyck</HI> the Mortgager, was paid off, and that this last Mortgage for securing the payment of One Hundred and Twenty five Pounds to <HI>Steenwyck,</HI> was for all the Money that was then Due by Bond, or other-wise, Tho' it seems Strange, that <HI>Steenwyck</HI> should advance the Sum of One Hundred
<PB N="17" REF="002940_0017_0FE69B9ED5A0B670"/>and Twenty Pounds upon a New Mortgage of the West-Neck, which was Mortgaged to himself before, and not take any Notice of a former Mortgage or the Money due to him upon that Mortgage, nor include the Money due to him upon the several Bonds set forth in the Defendents Answer; nor must I pre∣sume, that the Obliterations on the back of this Mortgage Deed, as the Com∣plainants alledge, are Receipts for payment of Money due upon that Mort∣gage; for as they cannot be read, I must leave them as they are, and presume, as the Heir of <HI>Richbell</HI> has done (when he sold the Reversion of the West-Neck to the Defendents) that the Money on this and the other Mortgages, was due, and by so doing, I hurt no Person; and the same is not otherwise pro∣perly in Dispute now▪ than that the Complainants would show, that the Defendents have no reason to endeavour to stretch their Claims to the Lands of the great Neck, seeing the Lands of the West-Neck are a far greater satisfaction than they pretend the Defendents had any Right to; but, as the Heir of <HI>Rich∣bell</HI> has Released to the Defendents the Equity of Redemption of the West-Neck, I cannot think the Consideration of his so doing, ought to be Enquired into here, upon this Suit. And the case being stript of all these particular Circum∣stances, charged in the Bill, and set forth, confessed or denyed in the Defendents Answer, It will stand thus.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="case restated">
<HEAD>Case stated by the Court, stript of the before <HI>particular Circumstances.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>JOHN RICHBELL</HI> in One Thousand Six Hundred and Sixty Eight, obtains a Pa∣tent for <HI>a Tract of Land</HI> in this Province, <HI>contain∣ed in three Necks, having to the Southward the Sound, and running from the marked Trees, upon the said necks, Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI></P>
<P><HI>John Richbell</HI> by sundry Deeds or Mortgages, grants away all this <HI>Tract or parcel of Land contained in these three Necks to sundry Persons.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The <HI>East-neck</HI> to one <HI>Rider,</HI> in trust for a Joynture to his Wife, and describes it by the name of his <HI>East Neck of Land, including all the Land, as well North into the Woods above</HI> Westchester-path, <HI>Twenty Miles, as the Lands below the</HI> path, <HI>Southward towards the Sound.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> By his Deed of Mortgage to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck,</HI> for securing the payment of Two Thousand four Hundred Guilders (which is equal in value to Sixty Pounds, Money of this Province) he grants his <HI>West-Neck</HI> by that name, <HI>Limiting it to the South with the Sound, and running from the Mark'd Trees, on the said Neck, Twenty Miles into the Woods;</HI> and under this Mortgage it is, that the Defendants had the first Interest in the <HI>West-Neck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly, John Richbell</HI> having already disposed of <HI>his East-neck,</HI> and Mort∣gaged <HI>his West-neck,</HI> by the Names of <HI>his East, and West, Necks, extending Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> he then by Mortgage, made in One Thousand Six hundred and Seventy five, for Two hundred and Fifty Pounds, grants all his Right and Title to <HI>the Neck of Land, commonly called the great Neck, bordered or bounded by the Sound on one end, and lying between his other two small Necks on each side,</HI> habendum for Ninety nine years. And it is under this Mortgage that the Complainants had the first Interest in the <HI>great Neck.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The same <HI>John Richbell</HI> having occasion to borrow more Money, did by Deed, bearing date the seventh Day of <HI>July,</HI> One Thousand Six hun∣dred and Seventy six, for the securing the payment of One hundred Pounds▪ to <HI>Thomas Kellond,</HI> grant the <HI>Reversion of the great Neck,</HI> and the <HI>Reversion of the West-Neck,</HI> to the said <HI>Thomas Kellond</HI> for the Term of Ninety nine years, to commence after the sum of Two hundred and Fifty Pounds, with Interest,
<PB N="18" REF="002940_0018_0FE69BB00DA1E228"/>should be paid to <HI>Robert Richbell,</HI> for which the <HI>Great neck</HI> was formerly Mort∣gaged to the said <HI>Richbell,</HI> and after the Sum of Two thousand Four hundred Guilders should be paid to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck,</HI> to whom the <HI>West-neck</HI> was formerly Mortgaged, for securing the payment of the said two Thousand four Hundred Guilders, and the Administrator of <HI>Kellond</HI> has assigned <HI>Thomas Kel∣lond</HI>'s Interest in the <HI>West-neck,</HI> by virtue of this Mortgage to the Defendants, or those under whom they claim, and the Administrator of the said <HI>Kellond</HI> has likewise assigned <HI>Thomas Kellond</HI>'s Interest in the <HI>Great neck,</HI> by virtue of this Mortgage, to the Complainants, or some of them.</P>
<P>And <HI>Lastly, Edward Richbell</HI> by his Deeds in One thousand seven hundred &amp; twenty Two, has for the Consideration of Three hundred &amp; Eighty Pounds, Sterling, Released all his Right, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in the <HI>great Neck</HI> to the Complainants or some of them.</P>
<P>After which time <HI>Quinby, Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Townsend,</HI> three of the Complai∣nants, for themselves and the other Complainants, on the Twenty ninth Day of <HI>May,</HI> One Thousand Seven Hundred and Twenty Three, Enter into Articles of agreement with the Defendant, <HI>Courtland,</HI> who then had the sole Right to the <HI>west-neck,</HI> by virtue of the before mentioned two Mortgages to <HI>Steenwyck,</HI> and by these Articles it appears, that the Complainants, or some of them, having before purchased the Reversion and Equity of Redemption of the <HI>great neck,</HI> aforesaid, from the said <HI>Edward Richbell,</HI> Heir of <HI>John Richbell</HI> aforesaid: And that the said Defendent <HI>Courtland</HI> for himself, and the Complainants for themselves, had severally used endeavours, to purchase, the Reversion &amp; Equity of Redemption of the <HI>West-Neck:</HI> It was thereby agreed between the Parties to the said Articles, 
 <Q>That (whereas it did not appear that the Line running into the Woods between the said <HI>great neck,</HI> and <HI>wester-most-neck,</HI> had ever been settled, run or marked out, or even the Course that it ought to run, appoint∣ed or limitted, which might occasion Differences between the Parties, if the said Defendant, <HI>Courtland,</HI> should happen to purchase the same <HI>West Neck</HI>) the Complainants should desist giving any further Directions to their Correspondents in <HI>England,</HI> Directly or indirectly, for Purchasing the Re∣version of the said <HI>West-Neck,</HI> and that by the first Opportunity that should offer, they should write to their Correspondents, to desist making any further Proffers for the Reversion of the same Neck.</Q>

 And it was further agreed by the said Defendant <HI>Courtland,</HI> 
 <Q>That in case he should become Purchaser of the Reversion of the same <HI>West-Neck,</HI> to pay to the Complainants, <HI>Quinby, Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Townsend,</HI> the Sum of One Hundred and Fifty Eight Pounds, in consideration of the Charge the Complainants had been at, in endeavour∣ing the Purchase of the Reversion of the <HI>West-Neck,</HI> with Interest, from the date of the said Articles. And further, "That the Complainants and the Defendant, <HI>Courtland,</HI> should endeavour amicably betwixt themselves, to set∣tle the Line to its Extent into the Woods, betwixt the same <HI>Great Neck &amp; West Neck;</HI> &amp; in case they could not agree how it should be run, then to leave it to the Determination of some indifferent Persons.</Q>

 It is charged in the Bill, and admitted by the Answer, that the Complainants did never make any further Proffers, for the Reversion of the said <HI>West-neck;</HI> and it is owned by the Defen∣dants, that the Complainants wrote a Letter to their Correspondents, to desist making any further Proffers for the same; and that this Letter was delivered to one of the Defendants to forward to <HI>England</HI> for that Purpose: 'Tis true, by the Answer, it appears, that another Letter was wrote by the Defendant <HI>Philipse,</HI> before the signing these Articles, and signed by the Complainants, <HI>Quinby,</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="002940_0019_0FE69BB027D08140"/><HI>Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Townsend,</HI> in behalf of the other Complainants, who were not present, which did prove prejudicial to the Purchase of the Defendants; but as that Letter was no part of that Agreement, and the hurt it did, was partly because Messieurs <HI>Partridge</HI> and <HI>Newberry</HI> (who used to correspond with the <HI>Palmers,</HI> some of these Complainants) did not know the Complainants, <HI>Quinby, Townsend</HI> &amp; <HI>Cornwall</HI>'s names; and partly because, when the Letter was shown to Mr. <HI>Richbell,</HI> who knew it to be the hand writing of Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI>) who had been formerly treating about the Purchase of the said <HI>West-Neck</HI>) and therefore supposed there was some design of imposing upon him. I say, this Letter being antecedent to the Signing of these Articles, and being wrote at the request, or at least by the approbation of the Defendants, cannot any ways affect the Arti∣cles, but they will s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and as if no such Letter had been wrote.</P>
<P>And therefore as to the Hundred and Fifty Eight Pounds, I am of opinion, That the same be Paid by the Defendant, <HI>Courtland,</HI> according to the Agree∣ment, with <HI>interest from the Date of the Articles,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="opinion">
<HEAD>Opinion of the Court upon the Case so stated.</HEAD>
<P>AND <HI>Now upon the whole state of the Case,</HI>
 As to the Land in Question, I think it appears very plain, that the word <HI>Neck</HI> must be understood in the Case before me, in the same sense it is used both in the Patent and Deeds; and in the Patent it appears <HI>the whole Tract of Land is said to be contained in Three Necks, and its South Bounds is the Sound, &amp; its North Bounds is Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> Now, it is plain, there is <HI>not two parcels</HI> of Land, for the very Tract that runs Twenty Miles into the Woods, has the Sound for its Bounds to the Southward, and in this sense the Patentee, <HI>John Richbell,</HI> understood the word <HI>Neck,</HI> as ap∣pears by the first Grant he made of one of these three <HI>Necks,</HI> in about a year after the Date of his Patent, I mean, his Deed to <HI>Rider,</HI> in Trust for a Joyn∣ture to his Wife: In the Premisses of which Deed, he calls it the <HI>East-Neck,</HI> and describes it by these words <HI>including therein betwixt the two Lines, all the Lands, as well North into the Woods above</HI> Westchester <HI>Path Twenty Miles, as the Lands below the Path towards the Sound,</HI> Habendum <HI>the said Neck of Land.</HI> So here we have as particular an account and Description of what the Grantor, <HI>John Richbell</HI> understood to be called a <HI>Neck of Land</HI> as words can express; and in the next Deed he makes, which is the Mortgage of the West Neck to <HI>Steenwyck,</HI> he uses the word <HI>Neck</HI> in the same sense, and Describes it to be his the said <HI>John Richbells Neck or piece of Land,</HI> lying upon the Main, being the most Westerly Neck of the three, limitting <HI>the Neck of Land</HI> afore∣said, upon the gravelly or stoney Water, which is the Easterly Limits of Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and, <HI>having at the South-side the Sound, and running thus from the marked <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> upon the said necks, Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> So here we find the same Description of <HI>a Neck of Land</HI> as before, <HI>the same Neck running Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> And then, as to the Mortgage of <HI>John Richbell</HI> to <HI>Robert Richbell,</HI> concerning the meaning of which, the present Controversie is, I can∣not conceive how the Grantor or Mortgagor, by the word <HI>Neck,</HI> in this Deed, should be understood to mean less than in his other Deeds of Mortgages; for here he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ells all his Right, Title &amp; Interest in &amp; to one <HI>Neck,</HI> commonly called and <HI>known</HI> by the name of <HI>the great Neck,</HI> border'd or <HI>bounded by the Sound on the one end, and between his other two small Necks on each side of the great Neck aforesaid,</HI> Haben∣dum, <HI>all the said great Neck.</HI> Now what occasions the dispute, is, that this <HI>neck</HI> is not said or Described to run <HI>Northward from the marked Trees on the said Neck twenty Miles into the woods;</HI> which words I <HI>conceive,</HI> are not needful in the <HI>description</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="002940_0020_0FE69BB24959A570"/>of this <HI>Neck,</HI> or at least the want of them, cannot be understood to limit or con∣fine this <HI>Great Neck</HI> to any Bounds short of the Extent of <HI>Twenty Miles,</HI> as the others run; for, Can there be a plainer Description of it, than here is, to wit, <HI>Bounded by the Sound on the one End, and between his two small Necks on each side.</HI> The Patent has described <HI>all the Necks to run Twenty Miles northward; John Richbell</HI> has Described both the <HI>other two Necks to run Twenty Miles, north∣ward into the Woods:</HI> And what need could there be, for describing <HI>the North Bounds of the middle Neck,</HI> after he had Described it to lye <HI>between his other two small Necks?</HI> or by what words are we to find out the Extent of the <HI>Great Neck</HI> to the Northward, if it must not run into the Woods as far as the others? Sup∣pose <HI>John Richbell</HI> had said to his Uncle <HI>Robert,</HI> as the truth is, 
 <Q>I have set∣led my <HI>East-Neck</HI> upon my Wife for a Joynture, and my <HI>West-Neck</HI> I have Mortgaged in fee to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck</HI> for Sixty Pounds; I will now give you a Mortgage of Ninety nine Years on my <HI>Great Neck,</HI> lying between my two <HI>small necks</HI> for two Hundred and Fifty Pounds.</Q>

 Now, can any body suppose, without doing Violence to Reason, that because he called it his <HI>great Neck,</HI> and Mortgaged it only for a term of years, and for above double the Sum of Money advanced upon the Fee-simple of the <HI>West-Neck,</HI> that there∣fore he did not intend him a Twentieth or thirtieth part or quantity of the Land for his Security. I think his having first described the <HI>East</HI> and <HI>West-Necks,</HI> as running Twenty Miles into the Woods, it was a full and compleat Description of the <HI>great Neck,</HI> and of its Extending as far as the others, when he bounded it by his two <HI>small Necks,</HI> on each side: And this Opinion is sufficiently sup∣ported by the subsequent Mortgage of <HI>John Richbell</HI> to <HI>Thomas Kellond,</HI> where he recites his having before Mortgaged both his <HI>Middle</HI> and <HI>West-Necks;</HI> for tho' he well knew he had formerly, in express words, Mortgaged the <HI>West-Neck</HI> running Twenty Miles into the Woods, to <HI>Steenwyck;</HI> and his <HI>Great Neck</HI> only by words of being between his other two <HI>small necks:</HI> yet here when he comes to speak of these <HI>Necks,</HI> as being formerly Mortgaged, he shews plainly, that he understood the word <HI>Neck,</HI> when apply'd to the <HI>great Neck,</HI> to mean the same thing as it did, when apply'd to <HI>West-Neck,</HI> for his words are these, 
 <Q>Grant, Bargain and to Farm-Let unto <HI>Thomas Kellond,</HI> &amp;c. the Reversion of one <HI>Neck</HI> of Land, commonly called or known by the Name of the <HI>great Neck,</HI> as also the Reversion of one other <HI>Neck</HI> of Land, being the <HI>most westerly Neck</HI> of Land of the three, which is Mortgaged to <HI>Cornelius Steenwyck.</HI></Q>

 He has not said, as also the Reversion of one other <HI>Neck</HI> of Land, being he most westerly of the three, and running from the marked Trees on the said <HI>Neck</HI> Twenty Miles into the Woods; Here there might have been some room to say he meant one thing by <HI>Neck,</HI> and another thing by <HI>Neck running Twenty Miles into the Woods;</HI> but as he has not said so, but the contrary, it would be hard to put such a Construction on his Intentions, when his words would never warrant, but Contradict such a strained Construction. Now if we come to the Parties themselves, I mean the <HI>Complainants</HI> &amp; <HI>Defendants</HI> in this Cause, it does appear that something more than the Quantity of Land lying between the two Creeks, was meant by their Articles of Agreement before∣mentioned; for there it is said, 
 <Q>That forasmuch that it did not then appear that the <HI>Line</HI> runing into the Woods between <HI>the Great and West-Neck,</HI> had ever been settled, markt out, or even the Course that it ought to run, appointed or limitted; therefore to prevent differences between the Parties to the said Articles, if the Defendent, <HI>Courtland,</HI> should happen to purchase the Reversion of the <HI>West-Neck,</HI> the said Complainants and De∣fendants
<PB N="21" REF="002940_0021_0FE69BB269186A90"/>to view the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>west-necks,</HI> and endeavour amicably to settle <HI>the line to its Extent into the Woods</HI> between the same <HI>Necks.</HI></Q>

 Now, if nothing was understood by the Parties, by the word <HI>Neck,</HI> but the Land lying between the two Creeks, as far as the Tide or Salt Water flows, as the De∣fendents insist: how id<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, nay, how absurd was it to take all this Caution about runing <HI>a Line between the two Necks,</HI> if no more was intended? or, can it be understood, that the words <HI>settling the Line to its Extent into the Woods,</HI> between the <HI>same Necks,</HI> can be satisfied with this Construction? No, it is Contradicting common sense, in my Opinion, to say so; but I do not rely so far upon the Articles, as to alter either the words or Intent of <HI>John Richbell,</HI> in his said se∣veral Grants or Mortgages, but by the Articles it is evident, as well as by the Answer, that the Complainants claimed the <HI>Great Neck,</HI> as Extending <HI>North∣ward Twenty Miles into the Woods.</HI> And tho' the words <HI>Twenty Miles</HI> were struck out, as not being a proper Recital of the words of the Mortgage and Release, under which the Complainants claim, yet it appears they all agreed to run <HI>a Line to its Extent into the Woods, between the two Necks.</HI> And for as much as the Defendants well knew the Claim of the Complainants, and at that time talk'd of purchasing nothing but the Reversion of the <HI>West-Neck,</HI> upon which they had two Mortgages; and tho' some thing was said, as appears by the Answer, of getting the Release from the Heir of <HI>Richbell,</HI> so General as to include a piece of Land formerly Exchanged with Mr. <HI>Pell,</HI> by Mr. <HI>Richbell</HI> bordering upon the <HI>west-neck,</HI> yet it neither appears from the Articles, nor the Answer it self, that ever the Defendants Discovered the least Design of pur∣chasing any part of the <HI>great Neck,</HI> or of <HI>the Lands,</HI> as the Defendants call them, <HI>running from the said Neck Twenty Miles northward into the Woods,</HI> but the Contrary; and it is plain enough, that what the parties seemed apprehensive of differing about, was <HI>the Running of the Line between the two Necks, to its Extent into the Woods,</HI> that is, least the Owners of the <HI>West-Neck</HI> should en∣deavour to run the <HI>Line</HI> too far <HI>Eastward</HI> upon the <HI>Great Neck,</HI> or that the Owners of the <HI>great Neck</HI> should endeavour to run the <HI>Line</HI> too far <HI>Westward</HI> upon the <HI>West-Neck;</HI> and this appears plainly to be the intent of these Articles, as to the Land in Controversie: And that both the <HI>Complainants</HI> &amp; <HI>Defendants,</HI> as well as <HI>John Richbell,</HI> understood more by the word <HI>Neck,</HI> than the Land between the two Creeks, as far as the Tyde flows. So that what appears here to be meant by the word <HI>Neck,</HI> in the Patent, and the several Mortgages that have been produced, &amp; by the Articles themselves, I must be of Opinion, that the Description of the <HI>middle neck</HI> is as Extensive as the <HI>East</HI> &amp; <HI>West,</HI> &amp; if so, the Defendants by their Release of <HI>Ed. Richbells</HI> Right to all the Lands in <HI>J. Richbells</HI> Purchase, will not help them, because the <HI>great Neck</HI> is expresly Excepted in their own Deed which has been produced here. Now if it be enquired, how the Equity of the Case stands upon the part of the Complainants? I think it is plain∣ly with them; for it has been urged by both sides, 
 <Q>That when the words of Deeds are uncertain, they shall receive such a reasonable Construction and Ex∣position, as must be without Injury to the Grantor, &amp; with the greatest advan∣tage to the Grantee.</Q>

 Now, by this Rule, it is plain, that <HI>J. Richbell</HI> having only Mortgaged, &amp; not sold, his <HI>Great Neck</HI> to his uncle <HI>R. Richbell,</HI> if the Neck be understood to Extend <HI>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> &amp; if that were allowed to be too large a security, yet it was no hurt to <HI>John,</HI> because h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> had it in his power to redeem it, when he thought fit; but if the meaning of the word <HI>Neck</HI> be limitted, as the Defendants would have it, then the Mortgagee had little or no security for his Money, and was without any further Relief; for as it appears
<PB N="22" REF="002940_0022_0FE69BC0F5C81CB8"/>by the Mortgage, there was no Covenants for the Payment of the Money to <HI>Robert Richbell:</HI> So that by such an Exposition or Construction of the words of this Mortgage, as the Defendants would make; This Rule of Law would be Inverted, &amp; the greatest Wrong would be done to the Mortgagee. But under∣standing the <HI>Great Neck</HI> to run <HI>to us Extent,</HI> or <HI>to the Extent of the Patent,</HI> which I think is the same thing, that is, <HI>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> the Com∣plainants, who claim under the Mortgage to <HI>Robert Richbell,</HI> will have Justice done them, and the Defendants, who well knew before their own Purchase, that the Complainants had purchased the Equity of Redemption of the <HI>great Neck</HI> of <HI>John Richbells</HI> Heir, and Claimed by that Purchase, <HI>all the Lands to the Extent of the Patent,</HI> cannot be hurt; for in their Answer, it is not so much as suggested that the Lands Released to the Defendants, by the Heir of <HI>Richbell,</HI> is not a full Consideration for their Money, and of a far greater Value than what they paid for them; and were it otherwise, the Defendants being Purchasers of what they own they knew the Complainants claimed, they could not, accord∣ing to the Course of a Court of Equity, expect to be favoured here; 
 <Q>for a Pur∣chaser out of Possession, with notice of a former Claim or Incumbrance (and such as its plain the Defendants are) can never hope to prevail in a Court of Equity.</Q>

</P>
<P><HI>I am therefore of Opinion, that both by the words of the Deeds, the Intent of Parties, and the Equity of this Case, the Great Neck does and ought to Extend as far Northward as the East and West-Neck.</HI> And accordingly, it is this present Day, that is, the Second Day of <HI>May,</HI> in the Thirteenth Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord, <HI>George,</HI> by the Grace of God, of <HI>Great Bri∣tain, France,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ireland,</HI> King, Defender of the Faith, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by his Excellency <HI>William Burnet,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Captain General and Governour in Chief of the Province of <HI>New-York, New-Jersey,</HI> and Territories thereon depending in <HI>America,</HI> and Vice-Admiral of the same, &amp;c. and Keeper of his Majesty's great Seal of the Province of <HI>New-York, Ordered, Adjuaged</HI> and <HI>Decreed,</HI> That the Defendant, <HI>Jacobus van Courtland,</HI> do pay to the Complainants, <HI>Josiah Quinby, Thomas Townsend,</HI> and <HI>Richard Cornwall,</HI> the aforesaid Sum of One Hundred and Fifty Eight Pounds, with the Interest thereof from the Date of the Articles of Agreement aforesaid, for that Purpose made; and that the Defendants and all Claiming under them, be enjoyned to Desist making any further Claim or Pre∣tence to that Part of the Great Neck which is to the Southwards and East∣wards of <HI>Branks</HI>'s <HI>River,</HI> and that they pay the Complainants Costs of Suit; and it is referred to <HI>Robert Walter,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> one of the Masters of this Court, to tax the Complainants Costs of this Suit, and to make Report thereof to this Court, with all Convenient Expedition.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX To the DECREE in the Suit of <HI>Palmers,</HI> &amp; others, COMPLAINANTS Against <HI>Philipse,</HI> and others, DEFENDANTS. In Cancellaria <HI>Nova-Eborac.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<P>THe generality of the People of this Province, are not unacquainted how much Noise the above <HI>Decree</HI> has made; tho' few but the Con∣trivers of the present Clamours, know the secret Arts and Managery that have been made use of to procure them; and the Ends intended by them are not difficult to guess.</P>
<P>Whether the <HI>Court of Chancery</HI> be, or be not, rightly founded; or whether the Expence of Prosecuting a Suit in that Court, be too great, or not, cannot affect the merits of this Cause: But the sole Question is, <HI>Whether Mr.</HI> Philipse <HI>or the Complainants be in the Right? And whether the Decree given by the Go∣vernour be just, or not?</HI></P>
<P>This being the true State (as the Complainants take it) of the Question, it is not to be expected, that to gratifie the Inquisitive and Curious, the Com∣plainants should enter into the Debate, <HI>Whether the Report of the Committee of the House of Representatives concerning the Chancery, that pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cured the Re∣solves, of the then honour able House, was founded upon any just Complaints, made to that Committee, or not? Or whether any such Report ever was? Or the Resolves fairly obtained?</HI> When the Complaints, and the Persons that made them (if any were) shall be assigned, that matter may be sufficiently cleared up Nor shall the Complainants here venture (if they could) to discuss the grand Point, <HI>Whether the House of Representatives can make an Act</HI> (as they say they will do) <HI>or not?</HI> Nor, <HI>Whether the Governour and Council can admit them to do so, and retain, at the same time, their Allegiance?</HI> Neither, <HI>lastly,</HI> shall the Complainants examine, <HI>Whether,</HI> if the Court of Chancery was imagined to be Illegal, Oppressive, or a Grievance, <HI>it was not more Pru∣dent, more decent and becoming, as well as more likely to prove effectual, to have redrest any Grievance occasioned by that Court, to have addrest the Governour at the beginning of the Sessions</HI> (who often publickly had declared his rea∣diness, to assent to any reasonable Establishment, Regulation or Alteration of it) <HI>than to have reserved these Resolves to the very last Moment, till which they were kept a Secret?</HI> Nor, <HI>Whether the declaring all the Proceedings of that Court, Unjust and Illegal, be either just, prudent, or consistent with the publick Peace, at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Reverse so many Decrees, as have been there given, and conse∣quently disturb the Possessions of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se who hold under them, without ever Ex∣amining into the Merus of the Matters there Determined?</HI> The Complainants <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; they shall not give themselves, or their Reader, the trouble of these En∣quiries,
<PB N="24" REF="002940_0024_0FE69BC79C75ACD0"/>tho' perhaps not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> foreign <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> if the Deter∣mination here was just and legal, it would have been, and will be <HI>Unjust</HI> and <HI>Illegal</HI> to have determined otherwise, and also <HI>Unjust, Illegal</HI> and <HI>Unreasonable</HI> to Reverse a <HI>Just</HI> and <HI>Legal Decree.</HI></P>
<P>The sole Question then, being, <HI>Whether Mr.</HI> Philipse <HI>or the</HI> Complainants <HI>be in the Right?</HI> And <HI>Whether the Decree be just, or not?</HI> The best way to enable any body to determine that Question, was to publish the Decree, with the Reasons given for it, which has been done a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ore; and tho' it appears, that the Opinion of the Court was chiefly founded on the Construction of the Deeds of the Parties, yet sundry other Matters were charged in the Bill, and appear by the Defendents Answer; <HI>made upon his Oath</HI> (which the Com∣plainants desire the Reader, once for all, to take Notice of) that the Com∣plainants conceived, entitled them to the Relief given by this Decree; which the Complainants conceive themselves bound in Duty (for Self-defence against Clamours) to Publish to the World, in order to show, how ground∣less these Clamours have been▪ part of which Matters are published under∣neath, and the honest and impartial Reader is left to his own Judgment to determine, which of the Contending Parties is or are in the Right.</P>

<P>Tho' the Considerations for each Party's Title be not a matter in dispute in this Cause, yet its conceived, that with all Men of Reason, they must be of weight to find out the Meaning of Parties. For, <HI>1st.</HI> It cannot be thought that it was <HI>John Richbell</HI>'s Intention to give, or <HI>Robert Richbell</HI>'s to take, that Ninety-nine years Mortgage (before printed in <HI>fol.</HI> 4) of a piece of Land containing only 320 Acres (the Fee-simple of which, at the Rate of 20 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> <HI>per Hundred Acres,</HI> was worth only 64 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR>) as a Security for Repayment of 250 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> If <HI>John Richbell</HI> so intended it, it must have been a Cheat and Imposition; And why should we suppose him guilty of that, when the words of the Mortgage (compared with the Patent, and the other Deeds) can bear, and plainly do bear another Meaning?</P>
<P><HI>2dly,</HI> Again, can it be thought that the <HI>Palmers</HI> should ever intend to ac∣cept of that 320 Acres, in Satisfaction for their Mortgage Moneys and Interest, amounting to above <HI>Twenty Thousand Pounds,</HI> and pay the Heir 385 Pounds <HI>Sterling</HI> besides, at a time when there were no Competitors in the Purchase, and when the Defendants do confess upon Oath, <HI>That were that</HI> 320 <HI>Acres to be Let, it would not bring in so much Rent, as the Interest of the very Moneys that the Palmers had laid out upon the Improvement of the Great Neck,</HI> and at the same time too to give up all their Improvements beyond <HI>Westchester</HI> Path?</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="002940_0027_0FE69BD519826928"/>
<HI>3dly,</HI> Again, Can there a Reason be shown, to believe or suppose, that <HI>Edward Richbell</HI> did not intend to sell as much Land to the Complainants, for their 385 Pounds Sterling, when no Competitors, as he intended after∣wards to s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll to the Defendant for 300<ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Sterling,</HI> when there were Compe∣titors; or to believe or suppose, that he did not intend the <HI>Great Neck</HI> to Extend into the Woods, as many Miles as the <HI>West Neck?</HI></P>

<P><HI>5thly.</HI> Again, Can it be thought to be Fair and Equitable, to make a pretence (if there was room for doubt) to that which others have been peaceably possest of, for so many years; to that which they have laid out so much Money in the Improvement of it; to that which Stands them in above <HI>Twenty Thousand Pounds;</HI> when the Person so pretending, never paid a Farthing for it, (in so much as the Lands Exchanged by <HI>Pell,</HI> and the Reversion of the <HI>West Neck,</HI> are much above the value of the 400 Pounds paid for his Purchase) but solely founds his Pretensions, on a supposed Omission of Words, in <HI>Richbell</HI>'s Mort∣gage to <HI>Richbell,</HI> and when these Pretensions are so palpably absurd, and repug∣nant to the intention of all Parties, as before, in part is showen, and hereafter shall be more fully.</P>

<HEAD>Observations on Charge 3d.</HEAD>
<P>Its to be observed, That as the Complainants entered not upon the Pur∣chase of the West Neck, till they had fairly askt Mr. <HI>Cortland,</HI> Whether he had thoughts of it<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and that he slighted it, as by the Answers to the <HI>second Charge</HI> appears; so, when they found that Mr. <HI>Cortland</HI> became a Compe∣titor in the Purchase, they were willing to desist upon reasonable Terms; and to agree upon such, they had many Meetings with the Defendants, in order, that if the Defendants should happen to become so nigh Neighbours, no Dispute might arise betwixt them and the Complainants, concerning the <HI>Line</HI> betwixt the <HI>Great-Neck</HI> and <HI>West-Neck,</HI> which then remained unsettled, but that it might be settled in an amicable manner. It appears confessed, That during the Treaty, before the Parties began to put their Agreements in writing, <HI>the Line betwixt the Great Neck and West Neck was talkt of,</HI> But the Defendants avoid saying what was talkt of it, and leave that to be guessed at; And to give a right guess, It must reasonably be supposed, that what is con∣tained in the Articles of Agreement (<HI>before printed, fol.</HI> 9, 10 <HI>&amp;</HI> 11.) concern∣ing the <HI>Line,</HI> is the Result of that Talk. It appears also confessed, That during that Treaty, it was talkt, <HI>That the Great Neck extended the length of the Patent,</HI> and that <HI>the Defendant</HI> Philipse, <HI>understood, that to secure the Twenty Miles into the Woods, from all Claims, was the Complainants aim;</HI> and the Articles contain a full Declaration, that so was their Aim, even tho' there had been no Declaration of it before. It appears these Articles were delivered to the Defendants, two days before they were Executed, as the matters that had been treated of, and agreed to in the Treaty; during which two days, the Defendants had them in their keeping to consider of. By the Articles it appears, that the Complainants agreed, to desist further Proffers for the West Neck, which was what was to be done on their Parts; And in Consideration thereof, the Defendant <HI>Courtland</HI> agreed, to pay their former Charges about it, and <HI>that there might be no dispute, about the Line running into the Woods between the Great and West Neck.</HI> —2— So flagrant an act, as the altering an Agreement, after the Consideration performed on one part, without consent of the Parties who had performed, on Faith and Confidence of the Execution of the Articles of Agreement, as they stood at the time of performance, re∣quires some Excuse to be found for it; And the Excuse is, that says Mr. <HI>Philipse,</HI> the Articles were not agreed to so far as were written, <HI>For, that he took Exception to the words</HI> 20 <HI>Miles upon reading the Articles,</HI> and <HI>told the Complainants of it, the first time they came for an Answer.</HI> But whether this
<PB N="34" REF="002940_0034_0FE69BF8CD2BB828"/>Excuse be Genuine, or <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nly bought of after the meeting of the Arbitrators at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> shall be considered under the 4th Charge, No. 8 &amp; 9. But here we shall suppose the Except on to have been made as he says; Then, did the Complainants agree that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se words should not be in the Articles? No, the matters in the first Charge, and that being their very aim by the Treaty, fully <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ugh show the impossibility they should; and its even not so much as pre∣tended by all the Answer, that they did agree to leave these words out, which had they agreed, would not have been forgot. Again, Who made this Ex∣ception? Not Mr. <HI>Courtland</HI> the other party contracting, but Mr. <HI>Philipse,</HI> who was not known by the Complainants to have any concern in the thing, further than as a Scriviner, or as a Friend to Mr. <HI>Courtland;</HI> and from Mr. <HI>Philipses</HI> having once Excepted to th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se words, it will in no ways follow, that Mr. <HI>Courtland</HI> did not agree to them. Again, as Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> confesses, that in the discourse in the Treaty, concerning the Great Necks reaching to the Extent of the Patent, he was on the Reserve, is not there great reason to believe that Re<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erve was also used here? seeing its concerning the same thing, &amp; concern∣ing which, the Complainants had fully, by the words 20 Miles, in the Articles, Expressed their intention? Again, can there be any thing so much as supposed, that could induce the Complainants, to depart from these words <HI>Twenty Miles?</HI> It can hardly be imagined, especially at that time, when they stood as fair as the Defendants, for the Purchase of the Remainder of the Patent, they having then the same Opportunity as the Defendants, to make Proffers for it by the Ship then bound for <HI>London</HI> and tho' the Defendants don't remember the Sight of the Letter, the Complainants put on board of the Ship, yet, as they remember, they told them, they would give such Orders, it amounts to the same thing, seeing undoubtedly it was in their Power to give such Orders. —3— Again, will it follow from such an Exception being once made, <HI>that it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>sisted on, and not waved?</HI> It certainly cannot, but if it was made, its not only <HI>unnatural, to think the Complainants should assent to it,</HI> for the reasons before, but also there's the greatest Probability, <HI>that it was not insisted on, but waved:</HI> For, after the making of it, is confessed the Treaty dropt, and they came to a Treaty again; how consistent the Answer is with it self, and how evasive concerning that, is left to the <HI>Impartial;</HI> when its considered, that its said, before the Treaty dropt, the Sum of 158 Pounds, demanded by the Complainants, was then agreed to; And again, its said, they met afterwards about the Articles, and talked about the Sum; Its a little Strange, that if the Sum was agreed to before, that that should be the thing talkt of, for its of things that are in difference, that one should suppose People would Treat of, and not of things agreed to; And when so Express a Demand as is made by the Bill, <HI>Whether at that further Treaty, any other thing was expressed to be in difference between them, than the Sum?</HI> is considered with the Answer to it, viz. <HI>But the Defendant</HI> Philipse <HI>denys, that the Sum was the only thing talk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of to be in difference;</HI> Then, what else was there talked of to be in difference? If any thing else, it might be reasonably expected, it would have been said what, but its not said what, for the words that follow are, <HI>for that the said words</HI> Twenty Miles <HI>were excepted to, as aforesaid;</HI> how is it said before, that they were Ex∣cepted to? <HI>when he read them, he Excepted to them, and told the Complainants so, during the former Treaty;</HI> But sure that won't be said telling them so, during this last Treaty: and if so, its plain, that nothing is showed to be treated of, as in difference, during this Treaty, but the Sum. And when that other Express Demand in the Bill, <HI>Was it not the intent of all Parties, that when that Sum
<PB N="35" REF="002940_0035_0FE69BF8ED4687C8"/>was agreed to, and filled up in the Articles, the Agreement was Compleat; or had the Defendants then <HI>a secret Reserve,</HI> that they might alter them as they pleased, after they had got the Complainants Letter back from on board:</HI> is also considered with the Answer to it, viz. <HI>The Defendant</HI> Philipse <HI>sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, <HI>he did not secretly Reserve</HI> his Intention, of having that Expression of <HI>Twenty Miles</HI> altered, but declared the same to them, as aforesaid.</HI> How, when, and what did he declare, as aforesaid, to that purpose? <HI>I.e, in a former Treaty, says, he told them that the words <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> should not be there, because they were not in</HI> Richbell<HI>'s Mortgage;</HI> But why did he not tell them so now? seeing if he had told them so before, <HI>the Complainants never agreed it should be so;</HI> and if it was not told them now, upon this last Treaty, (which neither these Words of his, nor any others in the Answer, can import that he did) and if he then had such an Intention, <HI>it must have been secretly Reserved to himself,</HI> he having no way Expressed such Intention, during this Treaty. It can hardly be thought, if a matter of such Moment, had been in difference, during these Treaties, that Mr. <HI>Courtland</HI> should not have taken Notice of what passed about it, but the Complainants verily believe he was no ways privy to Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI>'s Intention, nor does it by the Answer appear he was, or that he ever gave any Order or Consent to it. —4— If any such Exception was made by Mr. <HI>Philipse,</HI> on the former. Treaty (which the Com∣plainants do not admit to have been) from what is before, its conceived plain, that <HI>it was never assented to by the Complainants;</HI> and that <HI>it was not insisted on, but waved by the Defendants:</HI> it being not so much as asserted, that it was more than once mentioned before the Ship went, and that upon a former Treaty; And that such Exception <HI>was not insisted on, but Waved,</HI> will be more apparent, when the mode of Expressing the Exception, in <HI>fol.</HI> 76 <HI>&amp;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Answer, is considered; viz. <HI>This Defendant</HI> Adolph Philipse <HI>was askt his Opinion about the Agreement, Whether by the other Defendant</HI> Courtland, <HI>or the Complainants, or both, he doth not remember; but remembers, that he Answered, in the presence and hearing of the said</HI> Quinby, Cornwall <HI>and</HI> Townsend, <HI>in Substance to this purpose, That as most part of it was made up with Recitals, he believed them to be right, but as to that part which mentioned Twenty Miles into the Woods, it must be altered, because the Mortgage to</HI> Robert Richbell <HI>had no such Words or Expression in it.</HI> From which it seemeth, it was only objected to as a Recital, because <HI>Richbell<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s</HI> Mortgage had no such words in it; but that was no Objection to it in the third Clause of the Agreement, where it stood in the Articles, being there not a Recital, to which only his was a proper Objec∣tion, but as a matter agreed to; and to obtain which, and to prevent disputes about that matter, Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> confesses, he understood to be the Complainants aim, by the Treaty and Agreement; and which aim, was fully expressed and pointed out by that Agreement, and if he really intended such Alteration, he should then, or after, before acceptance of the Consideration from the Complainants, have made it, or insisted upon their consent to make it: neither of which, so much as pretended; and the not doing the one or the other, but accepting the Consideration upon a further Treaty, without once mentioning that Exception, must be conceived, with all Men of reason, <HI>a desisting from, or a waving of such Exception,</HI> especially seeing it was not made, by the Person with whom the Complainants were treating; And to illustrate this; <HI>Suppose one offers to do a thing, if another will pay him so much for doing it: upon the offer, the other excepts, or even objects, in plain terms, to the paying so much for the doing of
<PB N="36" REF="002940_0036_0FE69BFA485992C0"/>the thing; But afterwards desires the Person offering, to do the thing he offered, without desiring, or obtaining any Abatement of what he offered to do <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> Can any other Construction be put upon this, than that the other, by accepting of the thing that was to be done, does undertake to pay what was demanded for doing it? Will it be an excuse to say, that during the Treaty he excepted or objected to paying so much? Surely that can be none; unless the other agreed to the Exception or Objection. And to compare the Case in hand with that; here Suppose there had been even no prior Treaty where matters were agreed or understood to be agreed, as in this case it appears there was, but only the Complainants offered (by the Articles of Agreement) to desist making further Proffers, for the remainder of <HI>Richbell</HI>'s Right (when they had as good a Title, and as good an Opportunity to do it as the Defendents) if the De∣fendants will pay than their past Charges about it, <HI>and agree to settling the</HI> Line <HI>Twenty Miles into the Woods, between the</HI> Great Neck <HI>and</HI> West Neck, <HI>either amicably or by Arbitration;</HI> this offer was given to the Defendants to consider of, they confess they had it two days to consider of; Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> says, he excepted to the words Twenty Miles; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e it so: Did the Complainants agree to quit with them? <HI>No, its not so much as pretended:</HI> Did the Complainants agree, to desist making Proffers, with any thing less than what they offered by the Articles to desist for? <HI>No, its not so much as pretended:</HI> Was not the thing offered to be done by the Complainants, accepted of? <HI>Its plainly confessed it was;</HI> With what reason then, can the Defendant <HI>Philipse,</HI> put them to all the Trouble, of this Suit, to compell him to that, which its apparent was agreed to, by the Acceptance of the Consideration, on the part of the Complainants? <HI>He himself best can tell:</HI> With what reason have all these Clamours been raised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Court, for Decreeing pursuant to that, which was so apparently, and deliberately agreed to; and which (by the matters of the <HI>first Charge,</HI> had there been no such Agreement) its apparently absurd, and Repugnant to common Sense and Reason, and the intention of all Parties, to make any pre∣tence against? <HI>Let the World judge.</HI> —5— By this Article, compared with <HI>Article, No.</HI> 2: of the <HI>2d Charge,</HI> It appears, that had it not been for this Agreement, the Complainants had an equal Chance, at least, with the Defen∣dants, to have purchased these their vast Pretentions, by having their Deeds for all the remainder of <HI>Richbell</HI>'s Right; and by what's before in this Charge, It plainly appears, they would not have parted with that Chance, without believing, that by this Agreement, they were fully secured, from any doubt or dispute that might happen, about the Bounds or Extent of their Lands, which had stood them in above 20000 Pounds, as before, and on which they had bestowed so much Improvements, as that its confessed, were they to be Let, they would not bring the Interest of the Money, so Expended by them, in improvement thereof: Tho' in fact, by the Decree it self, and the <HI>first Charge</HI> before, if there had been no such Agreement, it evidently appears, there was no Reason for such dispute, or for disquieting them in their Ancient Possessions. But were there Ten thousand times more Ground for this vast Pretension of Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI>'s, yet, as its plain, the Complainants might have hindred him of Obtaining it, and did only desist hindering him thereof, on a solemn Agree∣ment, not to turn these Pretensions against them, but to settle their Bouuds ami∣cably, <HI>Its left to the World to judge</HI> HOW CANDID AND HOW GENEROUS <HI>that must be, to turn that Weapon put into his Hands against the Givers thereof, and that directly contrary to so solemn an Agreement, not to do it.</HI></P>

Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> was in the right, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ause it was the Express Agreement of all Parties, that it should be so, <HI>But where was his Right to strike <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the words</HI> TWENTY MILES? words of a Plain and Determinate Sense, and to institute in place of them the words TO ITS EXTENT, words of an Ambiguous and Indeterminate Sense; its not pretended that Mr. <HI>Courtland</HI> ordered any such thing, neither is it pretended, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to be supposed, that the Complainants ever consented to any such thing: As to his pretence for doing it, <HI>viz.

Some People have very bad Memories of what makes against them, and re∣quire a great deal of rubbing up, to make them remember such things; and on the other hand perfectly remember, things which they desire, or what makes for them, whether such things ever were or not: Whether that be Mr. <HI>Philipses</HI> case or not, the Complainants in this place won't say, but will leave the <HI>Impar∣tial Reader</HI> to judge, from what Observations will be made, on the <HI>4th Charge</HI> &amp; on the Answer in general. Tho' Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> swears, he does not remember the Complainants made any Objection to the alteration, yet, that does not say but that they did; and can any man of Reason believe that they did not? To see, That which he confesses he understood to be their aim by the Treaty, That which was plainly by the Articles shown to be their aim, to see that arbitrarly struck out without their Consent, to see themselves Exposed to Dispute with so great a Man, and to a Dispute they had taken so much pains to guard them∣selves against, Could any man of the greatest Patience see that, and not object against it? it can hardly be supposed; But his Answer to the Question, he says they made, fully enough shows an Objection, for, if they had not Objected, there would have been no need of Satisfying them or Convinceing them about it, as he says he did, with his Answer; But what was it that Satisfied them? <HI>He says he told them that the Necks are to the markt Trees, and what's above them is a separate Grant,</HI> a very Comfortable thing to hear indeed! (if he said so) how much it would tend <HI>to satisfy them,</HI> to see themselves exposed to the Dispute they had been guarding against, is lest to the <HI>Reader</HI> to judge; and how much of Verity was in this, to <HI>Convince them,</HI> the Rea∣der is referred to the Patent, Deeds, and Decree it self, to see and judge by. But whether he said so, or not, will be no small Question, when his Conduct, until the Meeting of the Arbitrators at <HI>Mamaroneck</HI> (as will appear in the next <HI>Charge,</HI> in twelve Instances there pointed out) shews, that till that time, he understood, as well as the Complainants, <HI>That a</HI> LINE <HI>was to be run to its Extent into the Woods</HI> BETWEEN <HI>the</HI> TWO NECKs, which will hardly be consistent with this Saying of his, in so far as by the Answers to the <HI>first Charge</HI> it appears, That the Markt Trees are at <HI>West∣chester</HI> Path, where the Water comes up on each side of the Great Neck, to which Place it was impossible to divide the Necks by a <HI>Line,</HI> because, so far they are already Divided by Water, and therefore, the <HI>Line</HI> rhat the Arbitra∣tors were to ascertain, must be beyond the Markt Trees, if any <HI>Line</HI> was to be at all: Is it reasonable to think he told them, what's Tantamount to say∣ing,
<PB N="38" REF="002940_0038_0FE69C071163F338"/><HI>There's to be</HI> NO LINE <HI>at all</HI> BETWEEN <HI>the</HI> GREAT NECK <HI>and</HI> WEST NECK, <HI>and,</HI> yet at the same Time, <HI>agree to the Signing of Articles, so expresly agreeing To settle a</HI> LINE BETWEEN <HI>the</HI> GREAT NECK <HI>and</HI> WEST NECK, which its impossible could be any where, but beyond the Markt Trees; The <HI>Reader</HI> is left to judge, whether he said so, or not, But if he did, he cannot but be of Opinion, (after he has read the Twelve Instances in the next <HI>Charge</HI>) <HI>That the Sayings and Doings, and the Defendant</HI> Philipse<HI>'s whole Actings, till the Meeting of the Arbitrators at</HI> Mamaroneck, <HI>were very Inconsistent with that Saying of his at that time.</HI></P>
<P>The next Thing he said <HI>To Satisfie and Convince them, was, That</HI> IF <HI>their Mortgages, or their Release from the Heir, gave them a Right to the</HI> Twenty Miles <HI>above the Neck, it was to the same Purpose, whether the words</HI> TO ITS EXTENT, <HI>or the Words</HI> TWENTY MILES, <HI>were made use of, or words to that purpose.</HI> A very Satisfactory and Convincing Thing indeed! If the Mortgages, or Deeds, or whatever they are of the Complainants, gave them <HI>Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> they would have had that, whether they agreed with the Defendants, or not; and then, neither the Words <HI>TWENTY MILES</HI> nor <HI>TO ITS EXTENT</HI> signified any thing, taken in that sense; and this might have been as good a Reason for concelling the whole Agree∣ment, by telling them, <HI>Gentlemen, if your Mortgages,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>gives you so much or so much, you'll have it, and there's no need of any Agreement at all:</HI> 'Twas a fit time to tell them so, and one stroke of the Pen could have been as easily and as arbitrarily drawn thro' the whole, as thro' the words <HI>Twenty Miles,</HI> if his gravely telling them so, was a sufficient Reason for doing it; and how could the Complainants have helped themselves, if he had, seeing they had desisted to make the Proffers they might have made by the Ship, in confi∣dence of this Agreement, and seeing by this time the Ship was at Sea, and impossible to be overtaken? Tho' its clear enough, by what's before, that the Complainants had not agreed to the striking out the Words TWENTY MILES; yet, were it doubtful before, this Answer of Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI>'s puts it past all dispute, that they had not so agreed; for, if they had, he would not have been under any necessity of Satisfying them of the Reason of his doing of it at this time, as by this Answer of his, he says, he did —7—</P>

<PB N="39" REF="002940_0039_0FE69C0734C23DA8"/>waited on the Defendants, to appoint further times; and two several times the Winter following, were appoint∣ed, at <HI>New-Rochel,</HI> at which the Complainants attended, but the De∣fendants came not, but sent Letters of Excuse. —3— Afterwards, a third Meeting was appointed at <HI>New Rochel,</HI> to which the Complainants and Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> came, but they came not to an amicable Agreement be∣twixt themselves. —4— Afterwards pursuant to the Articles, <HI>Arbitrators</HI> were appointed on each side, to de∣termine the Line, <HI>viz. Lanc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ster Sy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s, Samuel Bayard</HI> and <HI>John Hamilton</HI> were appointed for the De∣fendants, and <HI>William Willis, Char<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> Doughty</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Symmonds</HI> for the Complainants, to meet at <HI>New-Rochel;</HI> and the Complainants and the Defendant <HI>Philipse</HI> there met with the Arbitrators. —5— When it was proposed by the Complainants to enter into Bonds, to stand to the Award of the Arbitrators, but Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> refused it, —6— saying, <HI>That the Authority he had from Mr.</HI> Courtland, <HI>with his own being pre∣sent, and assenting to what the Arbi∣trators should determine, sufficiently impowered the Arbitrators;</HI> And the Complainants, willing to comply with any thing, rather than be de∣lay'd by so many Meetings to no purpose, gave also such an Autho∣rity and Assent as Mr. <HI>Courtland</HI> and Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> gave, to stand to the Award. —7— Whereupon the Titles of both Parties, and the Articles of Agreement were read to the Arbitrators, and some Arguments used concerning the Titles, and how the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ision-Line should run. —8— And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Defendant <HI>Philipse, then and not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> then,</HI> to the great surprize and admi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tion of the Complainants, <HI>pulle<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the</HI> MASK <HI>of the FRAUD and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>CEIT he intended, when he</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="002940_0040_0FE69C08B4FBE378"/><HI>scratched, as aforesaid, the Words</HI> TWENTY MILES, <HI>out of the said Articles of Agreement, and put in lieu thereof, the Words</HI> TO ITS EXTENT, <HI>and declared them to have the same meaning,</HI> —9— And produced the first Draught of the Articles of Agreement aforesaid, and asserted from it, that he would De∣monstrate, that it was not intended by the Articles of Agreement, <HI>that the</HI> DIVISION LINE <HI>should run</HI> TWENTY MILES <HI>into the Woods;</HI> and inferred, from the Complainants agreeing to the Articles, with the <HI>TWENTT MILES</HI> scratcht out, that they had given up that point. Whereupon the Complainants, re∣peated and showed to the Arbitrators, the Time, the Circumstances, and Manner of making the said Alterati∣on; and how little they Expected, from a Man of his Character, such an use to be made of it; after his Declaration of the meaning thereof, as before is set forth; and how unjust it was, to make that Alteration, after a full Agreement to the Articles, as they stood before that Alteration; And after having received, a full and satisfactory Consideration for them, from the Complainants, <HI>to wit,</HI> their desisting from directing, the makeing further Proffers, for the <HI>West-Neck,</HI> as aforesaid; and taking back their Letter to that purpose, and giving it to the Defendants, as herein before is set forth; And thereby putting it out of their own Power, to give further directions at that time. To which Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> replyed, Denying, that the Alteration was made in the Arti∣cles of Agreement, as asserted by the Complainants, and to prove that it was not, produced a Copy of the Letter herein beforementioned, wrote by Mr. <HI>Philipse,</HI> and signed by said <HI>Quinby, Cornwall</HI> and <HI>Townsend,</HI> and showed, that the Articles of Agreement, were dated two Days
<PB N="41" REF="002940_0041_0FE647E3D43176D0"/>before the Date of that Letter; and of Consequence, they were Executed, and the Alteration made two days before that Letter was sent.</Q>

</P>
<P> <Q>In answer to which, the Complainants allowed the Dates to be such, but alledged, that he the said <HI>Philipse</HI> very well knew, and could not but remem∣ber, the Disagreement about the Quantity of Money that was to be inserted in the Articles, was, after the Articles were drawn and dated; and that it was two Days afterwards, before the Execution thereof, and that, from the Circumstances of the Agreement to the Sum, just as the Ship was going to sail, the haste to get the Complainants Letter back, and the other Circum∣stances before, he could not but recollect soon, if he had forgot, the cause of the Difference of the Dates, and that the Letter wrote by Mr. <HI>Philipse,</HI> was on board at the Narrows before they went into Mr. <HI>Courtlands</HI> to execute the Agreement; at which time the Alteration was made; and this he could not deny upon Oath, and referred it to him. Whereupon the Complainants <HI>thought</HI> (by Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI>'s silence afterwards) <HI>that he was fully convinced</HI> — 10— And then the Arbitrators went by themselves, to consider of the matter, and after some time returned, and said. <HI>They conceived they had not sufficient Power from the Parties, to Determine the Matter; but, whenever they would g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve them sufficient Power, they would be ready to serve them.</HI> —11— The Complainants then again pressed Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> to enter with them into suffi∣cient Bonds or Powers, to compel the Performance of such Award as the Arbitrators should give, but he would not agree to it. —12— That the Complainants had five several Meetings afterwards, at <HI>New-York,</HI> with the Defendants, in hopes of a Determination of this Matter by fair means; at one of which the Complainants proposed to leave the whole Difference to <HI>Ed. Rich</HI> who gave the Deeds to both Parties; which Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> would not do. —13— At all which Meetings the Defendants continued giving the Com∣plainants hopes, and appointing another Time, till <HI>September,</HI> 17<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4 when the Defendants told them, they could give them no further hopes of a De∣termination of this Matter by Agreement or Award.</Q>

<HEAD>Observations on Charge 4th.</HEAD>
<P>ITs to be Observed, That in <HI>fol.</HI> 145. of the <HI>Answer,</HI> the Defendant <HI>Philipse</HI> says, <HI>That Nature makes a</HI> NECK, <HI>and that the same cannot go further than the Water makes it so.</HI> Which, by what appears in the <HI>First Charge,</HI> under the Letters <HI>(b) (i) (k) (l)</HI> and <HI>(m)</HI> confines the <HI>Great Neck</HI> to the Markt Trees at <HI>Westchester</HI>-Path; And in <HI>fol.</HI> 106, he Swears, <HI>He always was, and still is of Opinion, that neither of the Necks extend further than Nature makes them so;</HI> Upon which no small stress has been laid. But, <HI>with all due Deference to that his</HI> OATH, the Complainants will beg leave to assign <HI>a few Instances,</HI> wherein he either understood the <HI>Necks</HI> to go further, or his Actions did not square with his Opinion or Understanding of the <HI>Necks,</HI> or, in plain English, meant one thing, and said, acted and transacted another.</P>
<P><HI>First Instance.</HI> Let the Reader turn back to pag. 10. of the <HI>Decree,</HI> where he will find this Clause in the Articles of Agreement, <HI>Ask whereas it does not appear that the</HI> LINE <HI>running into the Woods, between the said</HI> GREAT NECK <HI>and the said</HI> WESTERMOST NECK, <HI>has ever been settled, run
<PB N="42" REF="002940_0042_0FE69C166072EE38"/>or markt out, or own the Course that it ought to run, appointed or limited, which may occasion Differences between tix Parties aforesaid, if the said</HI> Jacobus van Courtland <HI>should purchase the Reversion of the saide</HI> WESTERMOST NECK. It appears in the <HI>2d Charge, No. 2.</HI> that Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> transacted that Agreement for Mr. <HI>Courtland;</HI> Then, the <HI>Candid Reader,</HI> and all the World besides Mr <HI>Philipse,</HI> will understand by that Clause, <HI>That the</HI> GREAT NECK <HI>and</HI> WEST NECK, <HI>were such things, as were capable of having a</HI> LINE <HI>between them, running into the Woods.</HI> And Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> knows b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t whether he did not understand so too, by the words <HI>GREAT NECK</HI> and <HI>WEST NECK</HI> there, and <HI>LINE</HI> between them; And if he did not, he can best tell what he meant by them there; For sure it is, if the <HI>GREAT NECK</HI> extended no further than where the Water comes up, (as he Swears, he always understood) it could not be divided by a <HI>LINE</HI> from the <HI>WEST NECK,</HI> it being already seperated from it by the Water; and if it was such a thing as was to be seperated by a LINE, from the WEST NECK, Un∣doubtedly, that LINE must begin where the Water ceased to seperate them, and from thence to run into the Woods; and on the one side of that LINE, (by that Clause) was the <HI>GREAT NECK</HI> understood to run, and on the other, the <HI>WEST NECK;</HI> which is further than what the Water, or Nature makes to be a Neck.</P>
<P>The Complainants say, The Almighty made every thing that is upon the face of the Earth, but did not assign Names to them, but left that to Man to do, and that some Men assign one, and others another Name to the same thing; and some by one Name understand one thing, others by the same Name under∣stand another thing. <HI>For Exemple,</HI> The Geographers and the Learned World, understand by <HI>a Neck of Land,</HI> that which joyns a Peninsula (or what's al∣most an Island) to the Continent or Main Land; and the similitude seemeth to be drawn from the human Body; for as the Neck there joyns the Head to the Body, so a Neck of Land joyns a Peninsula to a Continent; and there, neither the Peninsula nor the Continent are understood to be included in the Neck, no more than the Head or Body of a Man are included in his Neck. Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> again, being a little more favourable to the Complainants, than the learned World, in the meaning of a <HI>Neck of Land,</HI> allows it to contain, not only what the Learned World understand by <HI>a Neck of Land,</HI> but also the Peninsula it self, or something in a gross way, allows the <HI>Head</HI> to be part of the <HI>Neck:</HI> This certainly is favourable! seeing the Complainants can show no Title to the Peninsula, more than to the part of the Main Land they claim; and of Consequence, had he dealt with them so hard as the Learned World, (it seems) would do, instead of 320 Acres, that he allows them, the learned World would not have left them, perhaps, the 20 Acres; so the 300 is a piece of meer Favour and Grace.</P>
<P>But others again, (in still a more gross and vulgar way) such as <HI>Governour Lovelace, John Richbell, John Rider, Robert Richbell, Steenwick, Kelland, Edward Richbell,</HI> and the <HI>Complainants,</HI> by the Patent and Deeds before Printed, tell you plainly, that they understand, that a <HI>Neck of Land</HI> con∣tains, not only the <HI>Neck,</HI> (as the Learned World understand it) and the whole <HI>Peninsula,</HI> (as Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> is so favourable to understand it) but also a part of the <HI>Main Land</HI> besides; and even Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> by his Words and Actions, for near one year (as by this and the eleven following <HI>Instances</HI> will appear) had the same way of Thinking of a <HI>Neck</HI> too. The Complainants
<PB N="43" REF="002940_0043_0FE69C16E21985D0"/>don't deny that the Name is gross, and far from being accurate and expressive the thing meant; but its s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Excuse, that the whole Herd of Statuaries and Painters have given as gross and unapt Names from things meant by them; As, By what they call a <HI>Head,</HI> they mean <HI>Head, Neck</HI> and <HI>Shoulders.</HI> Our Fore-Fathers, (whom we ought not to despise) have by a <HI>Yard of Land,</HI> meant often, many Acres, whereas the Learned World, by <HI>A Yard of Land,</HI> don't mean so much as the <HI>Four hundreath part o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> one Acre.</HI> Nay, for one Name that's accurately Expressive, of the thing meant by it, the Complainants will be at no great loss to assign ten Names that are not. But had the Complai∣nants no such Presidents of Vulgar Conceptions to cite, they think its a sufficient Excuse, that its the Liberty and Priviledge of Mankind to assign such Names as they think proper to Things, and also to assign such Meanings as they think proper to Names; and if a Man will call his Land, or any part of it, a <HI>Head,</HI> a <HI>Neck,</HI> a <HI>Shoulder,</HI> a <HI>Hand,</HI> a <HI>Finger,</HI> or a <HI>Toe,</HI> &amp;c. who can hinder him? And if he tells you, that by the Name of <HI>Head, Neck, Shoul∣der,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>of Land,</HI> he means a Tract bounded so and so, what reason can there be to mis-believe him? for he certainly best knows what he means by the Names he uses. What right has the Learned World, or Mr. <HI>Philipse,</HI> to say to the Parties to all the before Deeds, <HI>We understand so and so by the word</HI> NECK, <HI>and you shall not have the Liberty of understanding otherwise?</HI> The Complainants say, the Learn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d World have no such Right, and far le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Mr. <HI>Philipse;</HI> and that neither have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight to impose Names or Meanings on any Body, but as the Liberty of every ones Meaning and Naming for himself, has hitherto existed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y hope that Liberty will continue, notwithstanding all the Efforts of <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI> to the contrary.</P>
<P><HI>Second Instance.</HI> Let the Reader turn to the <HI>3d Clause</HI> of the <HI>Agreement,</HI> in pag. 10 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 11, which has these Words, <HI>And shall proceed from thence to take a View of the said</HI> Great Neck <HI>and the</HI> Westermost Neck, <HI>and after they have so viewed the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, will endeavour amicably, betwixt themselves, to settle the Line <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> into the Woods, betwixt the same Necks.</HI> We shall sup∣pose the Words <HI>Twenty Miles</HI> had not been there, and the Articles always to have been as <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI> has taken upon himself to alter them, as appears in the <HI>3d Charge;</HI> and were they even so, Can any man who reads that Clause, think it was the understanding of the Parties, who transacted that Agreement, that the <HI>GREAT NECK</HI> and <HI>WEST NECK</HI> were such Things as were not capable of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a <HI>LINE</HI> between them? But if what <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI> Swears be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> understood so there: How consistent his understand∣ing will be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Readers, is left to be judged of.</P>
<P><HI>Third <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> Let the Reader turn to the <HI>Additional Agreement</HI> in pag. 11. and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and consider it, which, as appears by <HI>Charge 3d, No. 7.</HI> was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Philipse</HI> himself, with this, That its confessed by the <HI>Answer,</HI> pag. 167 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Great Neck, <HI>so far as the Water makes it a Neck, is much larger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> West-Neck, <HI>so understood.</HI> And in <HI>fol.</HI> 159. its admitted, <HI>That the</HI> Great Neck, <HI>so understood, contains only 320 Acres;</HI> and of Conse∣quence, the <HI>West-Neck</HI> contains much less than 320 Acres: And on the whole, let the Reader judge, VVhether by the word NECK, thrice mentioned in that Agreement, there was not more understood, than what he Swears he always understood of the Necks. To lead the Reader the easier to consider
<PB N="44" REF="002940_0044_0FE69C1C8DCC64F8"/>this, he finds by that Agreement, it was agreed, <HI>That in case the Complainants Agents should <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>tually have finished a Bargain for the aforesaid</HI> Westermost Neck, <HI>then the Complainants were to convey one half thereof to Mr.</HI> Courtland, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing an equal half of the Purchase Money, and bearing likewise a f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll half of all the Incrumbrances, that are upon the said Neck.</HI> Now, Suppose the Complainants had made the Purchase of all the remainder of <HI>Richbell</HI>'s Right, (as appears by <HI>Charge 3d, No. 5.</HI> they were about to have done) and suppose the Defendants then der<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed of the Complainants to perform this Additional Agreement, and to that Demand the Complainants had answered, <HI>Gentlemen, We agreed with you, 'tis true, to let you into the half of the Purchase of the</HI> WEST NECK, <HI>bearing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e half of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ncumbrances upon it, and paying one half of the Purchase Money; but we meant by the</HI> WEST NECK <HI>only so far as the Water makes it a</HI> NECK, <HI>which contains much less than 320 Acres; Now, if you'll discharge one half of the Incumbrances which are upon it</HI> (which by <HI>Charge 1st, No.</HI> 3. is said by the Defendant, to be as much again as the In∣cumbrances on the <HI>Great Neck,</HI> which are <HI>Twenty Thousand Pounds</HI>) <HI>to wit, the half of</HI> 40,000 Pounds, <HI>We will Convey to you for it, the half of the</HI> WEST NECK (which is the half of much less than 320 Acres) <HI>and we will not insist upon the half of the Purchase Money.</HI> Now, according to <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI>'s way of understanding the Necks, this would have been a generous Proffer in the Complainants, to have given this <HI>Less than</HI> 160 <HI>Acres,</HI> for <HI>Twenty Thousand Pounds,</HI> when they might have insisted on the half of the Purchase Money besides. That it was <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI>'s Meaning to accept of this generous Proffer of the Complainants, if this case had happened, who can doubt? seeing <HI>he Swears, He always was of Opinion,</HI> (or, which is the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ame) <HI>understood the</HI> NECKS <HI>to run Only so far as the Water;</HI> and in this Agreement, nothing more than the NECKS is mentioned (Here's none of his NECKS <HI>Running Twenty Miles into the Woods,</HI> which he cleverly Di∣stinguishes from NECKS so often, thro' his Answer) If this was his Mean∣ing, and he thought better to accept than to slight the Proffer of this Agree∣ment, as he says in <HI>fol.</HI> 100. of his Answer, he did; None can deny but that he was then very moderate in his Demands, for half of the Incumbrances on the <HI>West-Neck,</HI> to accept of much less than 160 Acres for them, and that of <HI>Land</HI> too, <HI>whereon no Improvement was,</HI> as appears in <HI>fol.</HI> 167. of the <HI>Answer.</HI> But behold! how variable are Sublunary Things, running from one Extream to its Opposite! The Man who was lately Satisfied, to accept of much less than ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ACRES <HI>of Land, whereon no Improvement was, for</HI> TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS, so great a Change is wrought on him, that for only FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS, for which he has got the Lands Exchanged by <HI>Pell,</HI> to which he had no Pretence before, and the Reversion of the WEST-NECK, which are admitted to be of much more Value than <HI>Four Hundred Pounds,</HI> Now nothing less will serve him, for the same <HI>Four Hundred Pounds,</HI> than to have, over and above that, ONE HUNDRED TIMES ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY ACRES OF SUCH LAND, and that from People too, who, with their Ancestor, have been above Twenty Five Years in Pos∣session of it; People who have Expended a great deal in Improving of it, People who have paid the full Value of it, for it; People whom he had Solemnly agreed with, to have no Difference with them about it. Upon the Whole, the Complainants think, The Candid and Judicious Reader cannot long be at a stand in Determining, That <HI>Either Mr.</HI> Philipse
<PB N="45" REF="002940_0045_0FE69C1CB2BD9020"/><HI>meant more by the Word</HI> NECK, <HI>Thrice mentioned in the Additional Articles, than by his Answer, he Swears he always did;</HI> Or else <HI>He meant to give more than half of the Incumbrances on the</HI> WEST NECK, <HI>for what's much less than</HI> 160 <HI>Acres of Unimproved Land.</HI> If he meant the first, the Complai∣nants think the Reader will be at some Difficulty to reconcile it with his Oath; for the Complainants cannot see how to Reconcile them; And if he meant the last, the Reader will be no less at a L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss to Reconcile his then Moderation, and his now Vast Demands. And the Complainants think, the Man will be of a happy Invention, that can show what else Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> meant, if he meant neither of these, barring that of his Meaning as <HI>Hackerton</HI> did of his Cow, or which is the same, That he meant, that he was to mean by the Word NECK, when the Complainants should Claim; by it, only so far as the Water comes; but when he himself should Claim by it, in that Agreement, then he was to mean all that, and Twenty Miles more. This Third Meaning of <HI>Hackerton</HI>'s the Complainants allow, he might have, and therefore they must barr the Man of Invention from assigning that as another Meaning.</P>
<P>And now the Complainants will come to the Articles of the <HI>4th Charge,</HI> for some <HI>further Instances</HI> of Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI>'s Meaning more by the NECKS than he Swears he ever did. Or, &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Fourth Instance.</HI> —1— Its confessed, <HI>The time appointed by the Articles, for settling the</HI> DIVISION LINE, <HI>between the</HI> GREAT NECK <HI>and</HI> WEST NECK, <HI>was put off by the Defendants.</HI> Will Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> say, he understood here, that the <HI>GREAT NECK</HI> and <HI>WEST NECK,</HI> were not capable of having <HI>ANY LINE</HI> run betwixt them? If what he Swears be true, he then so understood. But these words, or that act, <HI>of putting off the Time for running the</HI> DIVISION LINE, <HI>between the</HI> GREAT NECK <HI>and</HI> WEST NECK, must with all Men of the common way of Thinking, import, That he understood the <HI>GREAT NECK</HI> and <HI>WEST NECK,</HI> were then capable of having <HI>A LINE</HI> run betwixt them. So either he thinks different from the Common way of Thinking, or his Sayings and Actions differ much from his Meaning. Again▪</P>
<P><HI>Fifth Instance.</HI> —2— Let the Reader see again the third Clause of the Agreement, in <HI>page</HI> 10 &amp; 11, for the view that the Parties were to take, in order <HI>amicably betwixt themselves to settle the <HI>Line</HI></HI> (call it as he has made it) <HI>to its Extent <HI>into the Woods, betwixt the Necks;</HI></HI> And in this 2d Article, Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> confesses, he told the Complainants, he designed to come and take a view of the Premisses; the above part of the Articles declares for what pur∣pose; upon this, the same Question may be put as in the last Instance, and the same Resolution must be of it; so that at that time also, it would seem, he un∣derstood differently of the <HI>Necks,</HI> from what he Swears he always did.</P>
<P><HI>Sixth Instance.</HI> —2— <HI>In February,</HI> 1723-4, its confessed, <HI>it was proposed to meet,</HI> viz. for taking a view in order to settling the <HI>Line</HI> amicably. Upon this, the same Question and Answer may be as before, so he then understood, that the <HI>Necks</HI> were capable of having a <HI>Line</HI> between them, or all the Absurdities before must follow.</P>
<P><HI>Seventh Instance.</HI> —2— <HI>But being hindered, he sent them word by Letter he could not go.</HI> From whence, a Man of the common way of Thinking, will
<PB N="46" REF="002940_0046_0FE69C2836854A68"/>understand, that Mr.<HI>Philipse,</HI> when he wrote that Letter, intended (had he not been hindered) to have gone, in order to settle the <HI>Line</HI> amicably, betwixt the <HI>Great Neck</HI> and <HI>West Neck;</HI> And if he so intended, the like Question and Answer may be as before.</P>
<P><HI>Eighth Instance.</HI> —1— He confesses, <HI>He proposed afterwards to meet the letter end of March,</HI> viz. in order to settling the <HI>Line</HI> amicably between the <HI>Great Neck</HI> and <HI>West Neck.</HI> Upon this the like Question and Answer may be, and so a further time, when he understood differently of the <HI>Necks,</HI> or <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ninth Instance.</HI> —2— <HI>But the Arrival of a Vessel hindered him, and therefore he sent another Letter.</HI> The like may be said on this, as on the Seventh Instance.</P>
<P><HI>Tenth Instance.</HI> —3— <HI>Afterwards, he met the Complainants at New-Rochel,</HI> viz. for to endeavour, amicably to settle the <HI>LINE</HI> between the <HI>GREAT NECk</HI> and <HI>WEST NECk,</HI> according to the 3d Clause of the Articles. Upon which still, the like Question &amp; Resolution therof may be.</P>
<P><HI>Eleventh Instance.</HI> —4— <HI>Afterwards,</HI> ARBITRATORS <HI>were appointed, pursuant to the Articles, for determineing, how the</HI> DIVISION LINE <HI>between</HI> THE TWO NECKS, <HI>should run into the Woods.</HI> Did he then, as before, understand that the NECKS were not capable, of having A LINE run betwixt them? other Folks would think, that when People solemnly enter into an Agreement about <HI>A LINE</HI> and appoint <HI>ARBITRATORS,</HI> to settle how the Course of that <HI>LINE</HI> should run, that these People really under∣stood, there was such a thing as <HI>A LINE</HI> to be run, which these <HI>ARBI∣TRATORS</HI> were to determine the Course of; but, if what Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> Swears be true, he had no such meaning, had no thoughts, nor did not understand, that the GREAT NECK and WEST NECK, were capable of ANY LINE betwixt them, at the same time that he appointed <HI>ARBITRATORS</HI> to determine the Course of it.</P>
<P><HI>Twelfth Instance.</HI> —4— <HI>That the</HI> 16th <HI>or</HI> 17th <HI>of</HI> May, 1724. <HI>the</HI> Arbi∣trators, <HI>Mr.</HI> Philipse <HI>and the</HI> Complainants, <HI>came to</HI> New-Rochel, <HI>&amp;c. viz.</HI> For determineing how the LINE OF DIVISION should run into the Woods, between the TWO NECKS pursuant to the Articles, upon which, the like Question and Resolution may be, as in the Eleventh Instance.</P>
<P>Above, the Complainants have assigned a Dozen of Instances, and if a necessity were for it, could assign as many more, wherein, according to the Conception of Men of common Reason, the Defendant <HI>Philipse,</HI> must have understood more by the NECKS, than to where the Water comes up; and that, he understood where the Water ceased to divide THE NECKS, they were to begin to be divided by A LINE, from thence running into the Woods: And if every Man of common Reason, must so interpret his Words and Actions; Why must all these Clamours be against the Court for so under∣standing them? when without understanding them so, the grossest Absurdities and Contradictions must of Course follow. But the reason of his Swearing, he always understood so of the <HI>Necks,</HI> may be guessed at a little; because, if he allows they go beyond the place where the Water divides them, whatever
<PB N="47" REF="002940_0047_0FE69C2859298B28"/>reason will carry them one Foot beyond it, will carry them to the Extent of the Patent; for, let but <HI>A LINE</HI> be, and he well knows there's no st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pping it till it come there. But when he Swore so, he must have either Thought his Antagonists so Blind, as not to see thro' it, or, that if they did, they would not, or durst not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enture to point it out: which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t he conceived not altogether amiss in, for tho' they very well saw that, and many other things herein set forth, before the hearing, yet they were very loath to Touch upon them, and what they did towards it, was in so tender Touches, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ew but Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> himself could gather much from them; and that because, they thought the Deeds themselves, made all clear enough, without dipping into these things; and so the matter should have remained upon that footing only, if so many vile, false and scandalous Reports. Reproaches and Clamours, had not since the Decree, been invented and spread thro this Province, of this Cause, and of the Complainants, and of most who have dared to do their duty in it, (by whose means the Complainants say not, but leave the Reader to guess) that more than sufficiently, give these Complainants cause, to keep the Truth no longer hid.</P>
<P>But to proceed,—5—The Complainants shall agree, that Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> now began a little nearer to square his Actions and Words, with what he Swears, always was his Meaning of the NECKS. And in order to that, it being, by the <HI>3d Clause</HI> of the Articles of Agreement, in the most Express words agreed, <HI>That in case the Parties cannot by themselves agree How the</HI> LINE OF DIVISION <HI>between the</HI> TWO NECKS <HI>shall Run</HI> TO ITS EXTENT (as Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> has made it) <HI>into the Woods, Then they have agreed, to leave the Determination thereof to six Indifferent Persons.</HI> The first Step that's taken, is to break th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat Solemn, Plain and Express Agreement: That this his Declining to enter into Bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ds, was a breaking thro' it, is plain; for when People agree to leave a Thing to the Determination of others, it cer∣tainly must be thereby also tacitly agreed, to do every thing that may be neces∣sary to impower these to Determine, and to compel the Performance of what's determined; and the denying to do these things, (as here to enter into Bonds) is a denying to comply with the Agreement, or in plain terms breaking thro' it.—6—The Sequel shows, how much of verity there was in this; if he thought that Power from Mr <HI>Courtland,</HI> and his verbal assent, impowered the <HI>Arbitrators,</HI> why would not he also give his Bond; Its said <HI>AN HONEST MAN,</HI> will never Scruple his Bond where he gives his Word; for AN HONEST MAN, values his Word as much as his Bond, and should think it a Dishonour to him, for any one to think it of less force; but it seems Mr. <HI>PHILIPSE</HI> here, did not put an equal Value on them.—7—The next step Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> took, to square his Actions and his Words, with what he Swears always was his meaning; was, <HI>that the Defendant</HI> Philipse <HI>then observed, that the</HI> TWENTY MILES INTO THE WOODS, <HI>was</HI> A SEPARATE GRANT, <HI>and that the</HI> NECK, <HI>cannot go further than the Water makes it so.</HI> How much truth was in this Observation, and whether this was not the first time, he had ever opened his <HI>RESERVE,</HI> by telling the Complainants so; the Reader is referred to the Patent, Deeds and Decree it self, which fully discuss that matter; and to the 6th Observation on the <HI>3d Charge,</HI> to judge by. And how <HI>Just, Equitable</HI> and <HI>Conscionable,</HI> his pretension by <HI>Edward Richbell</HI>'s Release is, the Reader is referred, to the <HI>first Charge</HI> and Observations thereon, to judge by.—8—Mr. Philipses <HI>denying, that this was the first time, that he had Expressed his Sentiments about the Boundaries;</HI> must appear very Evasive and Ambigu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>us; when its considered, that a Man may have different
<PB N="48" REF="002940_0048_0FE69C2B17901AC0"/>Sentiments at different Times, and declaring any of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, comes up to all this: and this may as well mean, that he had before declared his Sentiments, that the Boundaries of the <HI>GREAT NECK,</HI> went to the Extent of the Patent, as that they did not; but when its considered, that Mr. <HI>Philipse,</HI> for near a years time, <HI>viz.</HI> From the Executing of the Articles to this time, <HI>had different Sentiments, even at the same times,</HI> viz. a Set of <HI>EXPRESSED SENTI∣MENTS</HI> by his Words and Actions that A LINE was to be run between the GREAT NECK and WEST NECK, as appears from the 12 Instances before, and a Set of <HI>RESERVED SENTIMENTS,</HI> that NO LINE was to be run at all, seeing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Swears, he always understood the NECKS to reach no further than the Wat<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and of Consequence, not capable of being divided by A LINE. Now his <HI>Expressed Sentiments,</HI> its agreed, this was not the first time he declared them, but as to the others, he can hardly show a probability, to induce any Man to believe he did declare them to the Complai∣nants before; seeing, his <HI>Expressed Sentiments,</HI> were so Diametrically opposite thereto. The next Paragraph, <HI>viz. And affirms, that he had long before, and at several times, told some of the Complainants, they had a Right to no more than the <HI>Middle Neck</HI> only; as has been set forth before.</HI> When its considered, will appear equally Ambiguous with the last; for, as to what's before the words, <HI>as has been set forth before,</HI> its agreed he might tell them so, and the Complainants never pretended to any more than the <HI>Middle Neck;</HI> but they always understood the <HI>Middle Neck,</HI> to extend further than what he says he understood it, so that that was just nothing. Then does the words, <HI>as has been set forth before</HI> determine his meaning here, to be theirs or his? No, for the Complainants set forth before, that the <HI>Middle</HI> or <HI>Great Neck,</HI> does extend to the Extent of the Patent, and he otherwise, and which of these is meant, is left Ambiguous. The next Paragraph is, <HI>The alteration of the Articles, was declared at first sight thereof.</HI> The Complainants need not dispute that, seeing, as before, they were not with him at the first sight thereof, as appears by the 2d and 6th Articles, and latter part of the first Article of the 3d Charge, and the Observations thereon; and of Consequence, that declaration was not to them. The next Paragraph is, <HI>And at the time of making the alteration, not objected against by them, as is set forth before.</HI> That the alteration was objected to, the Complainants conceive plain, from what appears under the 6th Article of the 4th Charge, and Observations thereon. But why did not Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> once mention to the Arbitrators, <HI>this (so much insisted on) Argument,</HI> that he objected to the words <HI>TWENTY MILES</HI> before hand; it seems very strange, that what he now conceives, <HI>so weighty an Argument,</HI> should have been intirely forgot by him, and not one word of it thought of, at least Expressed, during all this Arbitration, the Complainants may well say so, seeing thro' all his Answer he does not say he did; but to make up for it, he here introduces in his Answer, concerning the Transactions before the Arbitrators, a repetition of the old Story, in order probably to induce these who read it unwarily, to think that it was a matter insisted on or mentioned before the Arbitrators: but whoever will but read it, with the least Attention, may easily see, its not pretended to be a matter mentioned to the Arbitrators; tho' sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly so introduced, as to make it seem as if it had. And as its Evident from hence, that this mighty new pretence, of having objected to the TWENTY MILES beforehand, and of having told the Complainants thereof, was not so much as once thought on, or mentioned before the Arbitrators, the Reader is left to judge, whether that gives not a great deal of Ground, to Suspect that to be AN AFTER THOUGHT, as is before hinted, under <HI>Charge 3d, No.</HI> 2 and 6; for, had
<PB N="49" REF="002940_0049_0FE69C2BA1FA74B0"/>such a thing ever been, its hardly reasonable to be supposed, it would have been then forgot; seeing that time, was within a year of the Transaction. And to suspect that Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> finding his GRAND ARGUMENT before the Arbitrators (in the next Article) Defeated, by making it so obvious to his memory, that the Facts then asserted by him were untrue: there was a necessity of thinking, or dreaming of some colour or other, to make an excuse, for that flagrant act, of striking out the word<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> TWENTY MILES, after the Con∣sideration for the Agreement had been accepted of; and that without Consent of the Parties, as before in the <HI>3d Charge</HI> fully has appeared. And when the several places in the Answer, where this Exception or Objection is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epeated; <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">77, 95, 110, 112, 113, 115, 118, 147, 148, 149.</NOTE> are carefully consider'd together, these Suspicions will be not a little encreas∣ed. <HI>Truth is always the same, but the Contrary varies.</HI> But these Suspicions, will be much more encreased, when he means that Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> is capable of taking, for to gain his Ends (as in the <HI>2d Charge</HI>) are considered, with his Swearing concerning his Opinion of the <HI>Necks,</HI> (as in the beginning of the Observations on the <HI>4th Charge</HI>) and concerning the power of Attorney (as in the Observations on the Answer in general.)</P>
<P>And now We come to the GRAND ARGUMENT insisted on before the Arbitrators, —9— which the Reader is desired to turn back to, and carefully to peruse. The GRAND ARGUMENT it may be called, for had it been true, there would have been a great deal of weight in it. As for the other ARGUMENT, <HI>That the</HI> NECKS <HI>are to the Markt Trees, and what's above them is a seperate Grant,</HI> it may well be called the LITTLE ARGUMENT, in respect of the Other; in so far, as any Man of very moderate Capacity, by looking over <HI>Lovelace</HI>'s Patent (above, Printed in <HI>fol.</HI> 1 and 2, of the Decree) cannot be long in Determining, that the Facts of that Argument are Untrue; For its plain, there's not <HI>Two Grants,</HI> but <HI>One Grant,</HI> Not <HI>Two Tracts,</HI> but <HI>One Tract,</HI> granted thereby. But this Argu∣ment appearing so fully Refuted in the Decree, there's no need here of fur∣ther showing the <HI>Weakness</HI> and <HI>Littleness</HI> of it. But Unluckily the GRAND ARGUMENT falls to the Ground! That Matter being so lately transacted, as within a year, and in so Unhandsom a manner, (as before, in the <HI>3d Charge</HI> appears) that it could not but leave lively Impressions of the Circumstances thereof, on the Complainants Minds; which being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id before him in so strong a manner, we find it brought the matter too clear in his Memory to deny it. But had this Matter been slowly followed, its submitted to the Reader, Whether, probably, <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI> would not have in time, Sworn these Things to be True, which he now, before the Arbitrators, so gravely Asserted to be True, and which by his Answer on this Point, he con∣fesses, He was Mistaken in. Its also here submitted to the Reader to judge by this, Whether Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> be any way entitled to the Observation con∣cerning Memories, in the <HI>6th Article</HI> of the <HI>3d Charge?</HI> And if he should be of Opinion, That this no ways entitles him to it, then they refer the Rea∣der to the Observations on the Answer in general. Its also submitted to the Reader to judge, Whether at that time, had he been in the Complainants Case, he had not a great deal of reason to believe, he should soon be clear of the Pretensions of Mr. <HI>Philipse,</HI> seeing the ONLY ARGUMENTS he then pretended to use, before the Arbitrators, were so clearly Refuted, as
<PB REF="002940_0050_0FE791D80B18FCF8"/>
<PB N="50" REF="002940_0051_0FE647E3F1410DF8"/>before; His GRAND ARGUMENT by its UNTRUENESS, and His LITTLE ARGUMENT by the same, and its WEAKNESS to∣gether. —10— This Sequel shows, That the Arbitrators were not of Opinion, that the Words of the Parties were sufficient to Impower them <HI>to Determine this Matter,</HI> as Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> asserted; and that they were ready to do it, if the Parties would sufficiently impower them. But notwithstanding that, —11— Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> again declined to enter into Bonds to impower them, tho' pressed to it by the Complainants; which, with his saying, <HI>He must ask Mr.</HI> Courtland <HI>first, before he would stand to the Articles,</HI> was a beginning, <HI>in express Terms,</HI> to declare, he intended to break thro' that solemn Agreement. —12— How Groundless and Unfair must this Pretence of his be, that he would not submit it in a proper manner, to the Arbitrators, who were so willing to Determine? when, <HI>in Conscience,</HI> he ought to have done it, seeing it had been so <HI>Solemnly agreed to be done.</HI> And how vexatious must the Reader think it, to have given the Complainants the Trouble of so many Meetings, to settle this matter amicably, when it would seem, he had no intention of doing it? And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> must Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> have been, of the <HI>Unreasonableness</HI> of his Pretence, that he would not even Refer it to <HI>Mr. Richbell,</HI> who granted the Deeds of both Parties, and who must be sup∣posed to know what he meant by the Deeds he gave to both of them. —13— And who must the Reader think the cause of, and to blame for <HI>This Expensive Suit,</HI> when Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> here tells plainly, He would not stand to the Agreement, nor give the Complainants any hopes of ending the matter by any fair means; but continued to lay claim to, and threatned to take away from the Complainants, their Antient Possessions and Title, which, as before, stood them in above <HI>Twenty Thousand Pounds,</HI> and instead of it would leave them only 320 Acres, which, he confesses, would not bring in the Interest of the Money, that they had laid out in improving of it; which was, in effect, leaving them nothing for their <HI>Twenty Thousand Pounds.</HI> And he must have for his 400 <ABBR><HI>l.</HI></ABBR> <HI>Sterling,</HI> not only all the Lands exchanged by <HI>Pell,</HI> and the Reversion of the whole <HI>West-Neck,</HI> as it extends Twenty Miles into the Woods from <HI>Westchester</HI> Path, which are not denyed, tho' expresly charged to be of much greater Value than Four Hundred Pounds; but he must also have for the same Money, the whole TWENTY MILES into the Woods of the GREAT NECK, which is not denyed, tho' expresly charged to be <HI>Much above Twenty Times the Value of that Four Hundred Pounds.</HI> How Conscionable, Equitable and Agreeable to the Intention of all Parties this Pre∣tence of Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> is, the Matters of the <HI>first Charge</HI> have shown; What handsom Means have been attempted and taken to obtain this Pretence, the Matters of the <HI>2d</HI> and <HI>3d Charge</HI> about <HI>Treating with the Complainants Corre∣spondents,</HI> and <HI>Striking out the Words</HI> TWENTY MILES, are a pretty Specimen: And how clear this Pretence is, of Contradictions and Absurdities, and how agreeable to these express Agreements, printed in <HI>fol.</HI> 9, 10, &amp; 11, and to Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI>'s expressed Sentiments, Actions and Transactions, till the Meeting of the Arbitrators at <HI>Mamaroneck,</HI> by the Matters of the <HI>3d</HI> and <HI>4th Charge,</HI> is something apparent; And how closely he has kept up to Veracity and Truth, with and without Oath, the <HI>Twelve Instances</HI> and his <HI>Arguments</HI> before the <HI>Arbitrators,</HI> give some Information</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, The Complainants doubt not, but that the attentive, honest and impartial Reader will easily and soon Resolve the <HI>sole Question,</HI> in this Case, <HI>viz. Whether Mr.</HI> Philipse <HI>or the Complainants be in the Right?</HI>
<PB N="51" REF="002940_0052_0FE69C38AD8F19E8"/>and will be able already to guess a little whether Justice has been done to the World, in the Clamours Trumpeted about amongst them, and whether Fals∣hoods have not been imposed on the World for Truths? And whether Truth hath not past for Falshood? Whether Honesty has not past for Dishonesty, and Dishonesty past for Honesty, <HI>&amp;c.?</HI> And for more Particulars, the <HI>Reader</HI> is referred to the <HI>Observations</HI> on the <HI>Answer in General,</HI> To which the Com∣plainants will now proceed.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE ANSWER In General.</HEAD>
<P>HItherto the Complainants have kept up close to the Facts appearing from the Answer and Deeds, and have not, to their knowledge, taken any Fact in their Observations, for granted, which does not appear from thence, notwithstanding all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> has taken to scatter, cloud and colour these Facts; so that it has been no <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Labour to gather them together▪ and it requires not a little <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ttention to discern some of them, through the Clouds and Colours used.</P>

<PB N="52" REF="002940_0053_0FE647E52B0A18D0"/><HI>Sterling,</HI> and that in Consequence of that his Treaty, he had given a Power of Attorney to Mr. <HI>Hask<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll,</HI> to dispose of his Claim, wherein the Defendant <HI>Courtland</HI> was to have the Refusal or Preference. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">53, 54.</NOTE> 
 <Q><HI>That the Defendant</HI> Philipse <HI>remembers <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e was informed, the said Power was sent back to Major</HI> Richbell, <HI>and that some of the Complainants at the same time sent Orders to Treat <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">60.</NOTE> <HI>And the Defendant</HI> Philipse <HI>further says, He has been Informed, and thinks by one of the Complainants, and believes it to be Time, That to facilitate the same, means were found out to prevail upon Mr.</HI> <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot">61.</NOTE> Haskoll <HI>to return the same Power, as aforesaid; and saith, That the said Complainant</HI> Quinby, <HI>could not disown but it cost Money, but to Whom, or How much, this Defendant cannot say, n<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r upon what Motives the said Power was so returned,</HI> THO' SURE IT IS THE SAME WAS DONE, <HI>in so Secret and Private a Manner, that this Defendant did not hear on't till some Months after, as herein before set forth.</HI></Q>

</P>
<P><HI>Impartial Reader,</HI> Consider that long Story of 24 pages, and say to what Use can it be of, in this Cause, other than to throw Dirt at the Complainants and others, and to encrease Charges, by swelling the Proceedings to an Ex∣cessive L<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gth; for the Facts pretended to be obviated by it, are not in the least obviated thereby: Is the Complainants Kindness and Candidness, <HI>in tell∣ing the Defendants of the Heir, and enquiring whether Mr.</HI> Courtland <HI>had intentions to purchase,</HI> any thing the less, for the Defendants knowing of the Heir before hand? No surely, for their Kindness and Candidness was the same. And this long Story is so far from answering that purpose of Obvi∣ating these Facts, that on the contrary, it plainly demonstrates a Tract of Unfair Dealing in the Defendants; for <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot">65.</NOTE> the Defendant <HI>Philipse calls it <HI>undermining</HI> in the</HI> Palmers, <HI>for to have Treated for the West-Neck, because Mr.</HI> Courtland <HI>had so great an Interest <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n it by the Incumbrances he had on it;</HI> Tho' the Complainants acted so Candidly, and with Notice, as before. Now if the Complainants Treaty for the <HI>West Neck</HI> deserves that Name, when the Defendants confess, <HI>They had Expended no Money in the Improvement of it,</HI> What must this Treaty of the Defendants, for the whole Right of the Heir, and of consequence for the <HI>Great Neck,</HI> deserve the Name of? when its confessed by the Defendants, <HI>That the Complainants had been so long in quiet Possession of it, and Expended so much in the Improvement of it,</HI> as in the <HI>first Charge</HI> appears, and that without any Notice to the Complainants of such Treaty, or asking them, whether they had thoughts of Purchasing, as in the <HI>Second Charge</HI> appears. Certainly if the Complainants Treaty for the <HI>West-Neck</HI> deserves the Name of UNDERMINING, this Treaty of the Defendants deserves no less.</P>
<P>Again, What is it to this Cause, if all that's said about Sending the Power of Attorney home, were true? No Man of Sense will say that it affects the Cause, but very much affects the Characters of the Complainants and Mr. <HI>Haskoll;</HI> and were it true, shows them to be Vile Men, to be guilty of such Underhand and Unfair Dealing (Whether it has any Affinity with giving Orders to Treat with the Complainants Correspondents, as in the <HI>2d Charge</HI> appears, the Complainants leave the Reader to judge) But will it be a Reason because the Complainants (as Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> asserts) are Vile Men, and have dealt Unfairly by Mr. <HI>Richbell,</HI> that therefore their Estates should be taken from them, and given to Mr. <HI>Philipse?</HI> The Complainants think, it will
<PB N="53" REF="002940_0054_0FE69C38CD1A10A0"/>hardly make a good Title to <HI>Mr. Philipse,</HI> nor had he any thing to do with this Matter in this Cause; but if they had Injured Mr. <HI>Richbell</HI> thereby, Mr. <HI>Richbell</HI> was the Only Person to whom Reparation was due for the Injury. How much the Complainants have Injured Mr. <HI>Richbell,</HI> more than the Defendants would have done, appears (in some measure) by the Defendants dropping it out in this long Story. <HI>That they might have had Mr.</HI> Richbell<HI>'s whole Right for Four Hundred Pounds;</HI> whereas it appears, he has now got for it, by the Complainants means, hear double that Money.</P>
<P>But to consider this Matter a little closer; Should any Candid Man ad∣venture to attack anothers Reputation, upon so slight grounds as the Defen∣dant <HI>Philipse</HI> here sets forth, (viz. <HI>That he has been Informed, and Thinks; by one of the Complainants, that base Means were used to cause this Power of Attorney to be sent Home</HI>) without first making all proper Enquiry about the Matter, which he had the means of doing, the Person impowered being upon the Spot, and might be enquired of, as to the Truth of this Matter, at any time since? Is that Insinuation fair, <HI>That thy Complainant</HI> Quinby <HI>could not disown, but it cost him Money, to get the Power sent home? Mr. Philipse</HI> does not say, that ever <HI>Quinby</HI> said any thing to that purpose; and if (as the truth is) <HI>Quinby</HI> never heard of any such thing, till he found it in this <HI>Answer,</HI> it certainly was impossible for him to disown; what he never heard of, or was Taxed with. How could <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI> say, from any thing he there sets forth, and without enquiry of the Perion having the Power, That SURE IT IS, THE SAME WAS RETURNED? The very nature of the Thing hardly admits of any such Swearing about it; and if ten Thousand People had told him so, it was not sufficient for him to Swear so Positively about this Matter; Nay, if even the Person having the Power had said so, it was not sufficient for him to Swear so.</P>
<P>The <HI>Impartial Reader;</HI> its conceived, cannot well escape being at a stand what to think of this SWEARING, but the Complainants Think he will be still more so, when they do aver, and offer to prove the following Facts to be True
<NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot">50, 51.</NOTE> <HI>viz.</HI> That Mr. <HI>Hask<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> brought that Power of Attorney over with him from <HI>England</HI> to this Place, in the year 1720. <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot">52.</NOTE> That in a few days after his Arrival, he gave it to Mr. <HI>Alexander</HI> to transact, as a Person who was a Council at Law, and had some Knowledge in Land Affairs. <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">52, 53.</NOTE> That <HI>Mr. Alexander</HI> soon after waited on <HI>Mr. Courtland</HI> with the Power, and show'd him it, who declared, <HI>He rather inclined to have the Money due to him, than to Purchase;</HI> but however, said, <HI>he would afterwards Treat further of the Matter, either for to settle what was due to him, or to Purchase.</HI> That no further Treaty was ever between them on either of these Heads: Never any Enquiry whether the Power was still remaining in his Hands. That the Power of Attorney was never sent Home again; nor was any thing ever said by Mr. <HI>Alexander</HI> or Mr. <HI>Haskoll,</HI> to give any reason to any Body, to believe or suggest, that it was; that they never heard of such a Suggestion till it was found to be Sworn in this Answer; But <HI>That very Power of Attorney</HI> has ever since remained in <HI>Mr. Alexander</HI>'s Hands here. That <HI>Mr. Alexander</HI> showed it to <HI>Mr. Murray,</HI> who is of Council for <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI> in this Cause, the first time he had an opportunity, after he had a sight of Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI>'s Answer, with much Surprize, that Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> should have Swore so! Has showed it to many People since; Showed it in Court, in <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI>'s Presence, at the
<PB N="54" REF="002940_0055_0FE69C3A9405BB80"/>Hearing of the Cause, and has it now in his Hands, where it may be seen by any Body who may doubt the Truth of these Facts.</P>
<P>The Complainants allow, that such of these Facts as appear not in the Answer or Deeds confessed, they have not the Liberty of using them as Argu∣ments before a Court of Judicature in this Cause: Yet, as so great Liberties have been taken, in inventing and spreading of Falshoods and Slanders thro' this Province, of the Complainants and their Cause, they claim the Privilege of telling Truth, in Opposition thereto. And if these Truths should be hard to bear, <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI> ought to blame the Inventers of these Falshoods and Clamours, whoever they be, and not the Complainants, for Opposing them with Truth, in Self-defence.</P>
<P>This may serve for a Specimen of the Clouds and Colours with which the Defendants <HI>Answer</HI> is swelled up to <HI>One Hundred and Ninety Nine Sheets,</HI> thro' which he is very Bountiful in bestowing of Epithets to and of the Complainants.

As for the rest of the Epithets, they disown them, leaving them to be bestowed by the Impartial, on those who have the best Right to them. However, so far they must observe here, upon them, That Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> ought not to take it amiss, if the Complainants have used some Epithets in this Publication, seeing he himself has Taught them the way of Using them.</P>

<HEAD>OBSERVATIONS ON THE CLAMOURS,</HEAD>
<P>AS to the Clamours themselves, the Complainants think it would be paying them too much Regard, to set about to answer them one by one, in Print, being well assured, the Propogators of them (if any Modesty they have remaining) must Blush when any Man of Sense puts a few Ques∣tions to them, such as, <HI>How do you know This? Is this sufficient Reasons for you to believe, and Report this again?</HI> But in general, the Complainants say, That they think all of them, that concern the Merits of this Cause, will appear sufficiently answered, by what appears in the Decree, and what's be∣fore in the <HI>Appendix</HI> to it. As to the other Clamours about this Cause, which touch not the Merits of it, they know none of them worth Notice, that have any Truth to support them, except One, and that is about the <HI>Height of the Costs</HI> of this Cause: As to which, it is true, that the <HI>Bill of Costs</HI> offered for Taxation, amounted to <HI>Seven Hundred Pounds,</HI> which Bill was moderated to and Taxed at about <HI>Four Hundred and Fourteen Pounds,</HI> which its also acknowledged is a great deal of Money for the Costs of one Suit; but whether the Complainants had not more reason to clamour for this, than Mr. <HI>Philipse,</HI> the Reader will be able to judge, when he considers what follows.</P>
<P>The Complainants do conceive, That as <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI> did endeavour to weary them out by Numbers of Attendances, in-order for the Settling this Controversie in an Amicable manner, as in the <HI>4th Charge</HI> appears; so likewise his Conduct in this Suit, gives them sufficient reason to believe, his Aim and View was to give Delay, and to swell the Proceedings, as much as in his Power, in order to raise the Charge of this Suit to such a Height, as that either the Complainants should not be able to carry it on, or to give ground for the Clamours now made about the Costs.</P>
<P>For, the Bill of Complaint, in this Cause, was filed on the 24th of <HI>Janu∣ary,</HI> 1725, 6, and the Defendants had even much more Time than, by the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Court is allowed to make Answer in; yet when Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI> was ashamed to ask more Time of the Court, he prevailed upon the Com∣plainants and their Council, to give sundry Months longer Time, as by Letters, <HI>No.</HI> 1, 2 and 3, following, will appear. And yet, after all that, put the Complainants, at last, to the Necessity of taking out the Compulsory Process of the Court; by which means the Complainants were delayed, for want of an Answer, till the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> 1726. and then the Defendants gave in an Answer consisting of <HI>One Hundred and Ninty Nine Sheets,</HI> whereof the greatest part could be of no other Use than to Calumniate the Complainants, as by a Specimen of it in the <HI>Observations in General</HI> on the <HI>Answer,</HI> before, in part, appears; in which Answer there was also a Demurrer, which took
<PB N="56" REF="002940_0057_0FE69C3AB4BC1770"/>long Time to argue, and send for Council for that purpose. And after the Decree was Pronounced, on the <HI>2d</HI> of <HI>May,</HI> 1727. tho' the Defendants Council were often entreated Personally, and by Messengers, to shorten the Answer, in order to take so much of it only into the Decree as was of Mo∣ment, yet they would neither do it, nor give a Positive Denyal, till the <HI>28th</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> when they insisted on having the whole Answer <HI>Verbatim,</HI> in the Decree. Whereupon the Complainants Council, suspecting Mr. <HI>Philipse</HI>'s View of raising a Clamour, from the Height that this would necessarily bring the Costs to, he made that Frotest in Letter <HI>No.</HI> 4.</P>
<P>As to Reducing the Bill of Costs from <HI>Seven Hundred</HI> to <HI>Four Hundred Pounds,</HI> its Notorious that the Complainants employed four Council in, this Cause, whereof Mr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ilton</HI> lives in the Province of <HI>Pennsilvania,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Kinsey</HI> in the Province of <HI>New-Jersey,</HI> and yet no Fees were ta<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed but for two Council, and nothing allowed for these Gentlemens coming here, who cannot be presumed to come from these Provinces for a small matter.</P>
<P>Which Matters being considered, the Complainants think, the <HI>Candid Reader</HI> will come into the same way of Thinking with them, concerning <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI>'s Delays, and swelling of the Proceedings, <HI>to wit,</HI> That they were designed by him either to disable the Complainants from Prosecuting this Suit, at so great a Charge, or to furnish him with a matter for Clamour, at the great∣ness of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>harge.</P>
<P>And it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> considered also, That the Sum Taxed does not amount to the one half of the actual Charges the Complainants have been put to, in the Prosecution of this Suit; and, how little ground <HI>Mr. Philipse</HI> has for his Pre∣tences, which have occasioned this Suit; and, how much Pains the Com∣plainants have taken to Prevent this Suit, by Amicable means, as all through the <HI>3d</HI> and <HI>4th Charges</HI> does appear; No Reasonable Man can but think, that the Hardship is upon the Complainants, and that they had the most reason to Clamour.</P>
<P>Upon the Whole, Let the <HI>Reader</HI> Judge, Try and Speak as he finds the Truth is.</P>
