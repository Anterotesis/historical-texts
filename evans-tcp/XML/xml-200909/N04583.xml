<Q><BIBL><HI>ECCLES. IX. 1, 2, 3.</HI></BIBL>
<P>For all this I considered in my Heart even to declare all this, that the Righteous and the Wise, and their Works are in the Hand of God: No Man knoweth either Love or Hatred, by all that is before them. All things come alike to all, there is one Event to the Righteous and to the Wicked; to the Good and to the Clean, and to the Unclean; to him that sacrific∣eth, and to him that sacrificeth not: As is the Good so is the Sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an Oath. There is an Evil among all Things that are done under the Sun, that there is one Event unto all: Yea also the Heart of the Sons of Men is full of Evil, and mad∣ness is in their Heart while they live.</P></Q>

<P>THERE are two Things in the Course of Divine Providence, which have been Perplexing to good Men, and stumb∣ling to the bad, and they are these, name∣ly, the Calamities of the former, and Pros∣perity
<PB N="4" REF="005695_0003_1026C0DFA72D05B0"/>
of the latter. Of these <HI>Solomon</HI> dis∣courses in the Words that I have read: The wise Man pondered upon this difficult Sub∣ject thoroughly, he weighed the Matter with due Deliberation, and revolv'd it in his pensive Mind, and then came to the following Declaration and Conclusion; namely, that <HI>all Things come alike to all, and that there is one Event to the Righteous and to the Wicked: i. e.</HI> All outward Things whither prosperous or adverse, comfortable or calamitous, are promiscuously dispensed without Distinction upon the Good and Bad, and therefore that God's Love or Hatred towards us, cannot be judged of or known by our outward Condition; <HI>No Man knoweth either Love or Hatred by all that is before him;</HI> he cannot reasonably conclude that he is the Object of God's peculiar Love, because his outward State is honourable, easy and prosperous, or that he is expos'd to the Divine Indignation, because his Name is cover'd with Reproach, his Estate blasted by Adversity, and his Body rack'd by accute Pain.</P>
<P><HI>Solomon</HI> indeed acknowledges, that this
<PB N="5" REF="005695_0004_1026C0E56772B1A0"/>
mix'd Dispensation of Things was perplex∣ing to the Good and ensnaring to the Bad; <HI>this is an Evil</HI> (saith he) <HI>among all Things that are done under the Sun, that there is one Event unto all: i. e.</HI> This seeming Con∣fusion of Events is a great Perplexity to those that are pious. The Psalmist in∣forms us in the lxxiii. <HI>Psalm,</HI> how much he was stumbled at this in the following Words; <HI>But as for me my Feet were almost gone, my Steps had well nigh slipt, for I was envious at the Foolish, when I saw the Prosperity of the Wicked, for there are no Bands in their Death but their Strength is firm, they are not in Trouble as other Men, neither are they plagued like other Men; therefore Pride compasseth them about as a Chain, Violence covereth them as a Garment, their Eyes stand out with Fatness, they have more than Heart could wish, they are cor∣rupt and speak wickedly, they set their Mouth against the Heavens, and their Tongue walk∣eth through the Earth, behold these are the Ungodly who prosper in the World, they increase in Riches, verily I have cleansed my Heart in vain, and washed my Hands
<PB N="6" REF="005695_0005_1026C0E6EE40D200"/>
in Innocency, for all Day long have I been plagued, and chastened every Morning. If I say I will speak thus, behold I should of∣fend against the Generation of thy Children, when I sought to know this it was too pain∣ful for me, until I went into the Sanctuary of God, then understood I their END: Surely thou didst set them in slippery Places, thou castedst them down into Destruction.</HI></P>
<P>What <HI>Solomon</HI> says in the viiith of <HI>Ec∣clesiastes</HI> and 11. serves to explain the latter Part of our Text, <HI>viz. Because Sentence against an evil Work is not speedily execut∣ed, therefore the Heart of the Sons of Men is fully set in them to do Evil; madness is in their Heart while they live:</HI> They harden themselves in their Wickedness and Impenitence, by the Abuse of God's Providence, for thus they foolishly argue: Well if the Case be so, that the Wicked pass unpunish'd (oftentimes) and the pious are afflicted, then I'll be wicked too, its vain to be religious, for God shews no Re∣gard to such, and makes no visible Distinc∣tion between them and others in his Pro∣vidence. But how rediculous is this Rea∣soning,
<PB N="7" REF="005695_0006_1026C0E89D7F50B8"/>
or rather Cavilling? For if God makes a due Distinction after Time, it is enough to excite the considerate Mind to Virtue, and deter from Vice.</P>
<P>In the mean time let us observe the Dif∣ferent Characters that <HI>Solomon</HI> in our Text ascribes to the <HI>Righteous</HI> and to the <HI>Wick∣ed,</HI> and the special regard that the Almighty shews to the former, even in this World.</P>
<P N="1">1st. The <HI>Righteous</HI> are <HI>clean, they have clean Hands and pure Hearts,</HI> they are un∣der the habitual Dominion of no Evil, but <HI>Hunger and Thirst after Righteousness,</HI> and having an Interest in the great and preci∣ous Promises of the <HI>New Covenant,</HI> it is the chief Desire of their Hearts, and the principal labour of their Lives, to <HI>cleanse themselves from all filthiness of the Flesh and Spirit, and perfect Holiness in the fear of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> The <HI>Righteous</HI> are <HI>Good,</HI> not only in respect of their State, but course of Ac∣tion. They are justify'd in the sight of God, thro' the Imputation of CHRIST'S Righteousness received by Faith. The Al∣mighty justifies them, however Men may
<PB N="8" REF="005695_0007_1026C0EC8D0C0AC8"/>
condemn them. And they are <HI>Good</HI> in their Series of Action, not only avoiding all appearance of cruelty and injustice, but abounding in Acts of Kindness and Bene∣ficence towards the Names, Bodies, Estates, and Souls of their Fellow-Creatures; and herein they resemble their heavenly Father, who not only <HI>is Good,</HI> but <HI>does Good unto all, and whose Mercy is over all his other Works.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The <HI>righteous Sacrifice;</HI> that is, they worship God both inwardly and out∣wardly according to his Prescription, they make Conscience of the stated Performance of it, and will not stick at any cost that is requisite for that Purpose. The <HI>Jewish</HI> Sa∣crifices were very costly, and yet they of∣fered them up statedly twice a Day, be∣sides their extraordinary Devotions at par∣ticular Seasons.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The <HI>Righteous fear an Oath.</HI> They have a Reverence for God's Name, and so fear to take an Oath, because it is a Solemn appeal to God as a Witness and Judge, and when they have taken an Oath they fear to break it, least hereby they should incur the Divine Vengeance.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="005695_0008_1026C0F00C51C730"/>But on the Contrary the <HI>Wicked</HI> are <HI>unclean,</HI> except in their own Imagination, their Hearts are unrenew'd, and Sin habi∣tually governs over them.</P>
<P>They are likewise chiefly and generally influenced by selfish Principles and Views, self is the Idol they Worship, to this all their Actions vail: They are careless of the stated Performance of God's Worship, they <HI>Sacrifice not,</HI> but under some Pre∣tence or other habitually neglect the in∣ward or outward Part of Worship or both, they will not be at any pains or Cost about Religion at all.</P>
<P>Again some of them <HI>Swear</HI> rashly and prophanely, and have no Veneration for the holy Name of God.</P>
<P>Now altho' Things come alike to those Persons, of so very contrary Characters, yet their outward Condition comes from a very different Spring, and will have a a different Issue. This <HI>Solomon</HI> gives us a Hint of in the Beginning of this Chapter, in these Words, <HI>For all this I considered in my Heart, even to declare all this, that the Righteous, and the Wise, and their Works
<PB N="10" REF="005695_0009_1026C0F191C531C0"/>
are in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of God. i. e.</HI> They are un∣der his special Conduct and Direction, their Troubles do not come by Accident, but according to the Council of God's Will, and shall surely Work together for their Good, even those Things shall be for them, which seemed to be most against them.</P>
<P>That which I am to speak upon from the Verses I have read is this, <HI>Viz.</HI></P>
<P><HI>That the outward Dispensations of Pro∣vidence are, for the general, the same to the Good and Bad.</HI> There is one good Event to both. Is <HI>David</HI> rich? So is <HI>Nabal:</HI> Is <HI>Joseph</HI> favour'd by his Prince? So is <HI>Ha∣man.</HI> And there is one bad Event to both, is <HI>Ahab</HI> kill'd in the Battle? So is <HI>Josiah:</HI> Are the good Figgs carry'd to <HI>Babylon?</HI> So are the bad, (<HI>Jer.</HI> xxiv. 1) Was <HI>Saul</HI> kil∣led in the Battle? So was pious <HI>Jonathan.</HI> Are not the Righteous generally afflicted in Life? And hence we are told, <HI>thro' ma∣ny Tribulations, we must enter into the King∣dom of God:—That strait is the Gate and narrow is the Way that leads to Life, and few there be that find it:—That</HI> in this World we shall have Tribulation:—<HI>That
<PB N="11" REF="005695_0010_1026C0F532274F48"/>
the Righteous are scarcely <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>:—That they shall mourn and the World rejoice:— That many are the Afflictions of the Righ∣teous:—That while we are in this World, we groan within ourselves waiting for the Redemption of our Bodies:—That we are judged and chastened of the Lord, least we should be condemned with the World,</HI> (1 Cor. xi. 31.) The Church is represented by the prophet Isaiah, as <HI>toss'd with Tempests, and afflicted.</HI> (Isa. liv. 11.)</P>
<P>And have not some righteous Persons been remov'd by Death in a Manner that look'd Judgment like? Thus <HI>Eli,</HI> who was devoutly concern'd for the Ark of GOD, the Glory of <HI>Israel,</HI> and Symbol of the Divine Presence, when he heard that this was taken by the <HI>Philistine</HI> Hosts, be∣ing overcome with a Pressure of Grief upon this Occasion, he fell back, and by the Fall broke his Neck, and died. This look'd very Judgment like, and yet it was no doubt in Mercy to him.</P>
<P>The Case of <HI>Uzza</HI> is likewise very re∣markable, who when he touched the shaking Ark, with a View doubtless to
<PB N="12" REF="005695_0011_1026C0F7C2416868"/>
keep it from falling, was immediately struck dead.</P>
<P>And did not <HI>Samson</HI> also dye a violent Death by the Fall of a House upon him, tho' he was favoured just before with un∣common divine Assistance in Answer to his Prayer?</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Psalmist informs us of some of the Wicked, That <HI>like Sheep they are laid in their Graves,</HI> they are car∣ry'd off the Stage of Time with Calmness and Confidence.</P>
<P>Now the Reasons of this mix'd Dispen∣sation of Things to Good and Bad, are these following, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1st. This World is a State of <HI>Tryal</HI> and <HI>Probation,</HI> and not of <HI>Recompence,</HI> wherein Persons are to be exercis'd and treated as Candidates, in Order to a future Tryal and Reward; and therefore a proper and visible Distinction of Persons in this Life, according to their different Characters is not to be expected; for that would blend two very different States together, and render a future Judgment unnecessary in that Day when God <HI>makes up his Jewels,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="005695_0012_1026C0F9471F4DA0"/>
as the Prophet <HI>Malachi</HI> observes, We may <HI>discern between the Righteous and the Wicked, between him that serveth God, and him that serveth him</HI> not, <HI>but not before.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2dly. GOD hereby glorifies his <HI>Sove∣reignty, he does in Heaven and Earth, ac∣cording to the Council of his Will, and who can say unto GOD, why dost thou so?</HI> The Almighty gives no Account of his Matters to his Creatures, nor can be ar∣raign'd before a human Tribunal: <HI>His Judgments are unsearchable, and his Ways past finding out.</HI> It is reasonable that God in the Dispensations of his Providence, should magnify his <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> as well as his other Perfections. Now this appears in his doing those Things which he might either do or not do consistent with his Ho∣liness and Justice. An Example of which we have in the Man that was born Blind.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The Almighty by this mix'd Dis∣pensation of Events to Good and Bad, promotes the <HI>Benefit</HI> of the former, and renders the latter <HI>inexcusable.</HI></P>
<P>As there are dark Texts in the Holy
<PB N="14" REF="005695_0013_1026C0FBC0195C30"/>
Scriptures, which it is difficult for us to explain, <HI>which the unlearned and unstable wrest to their own Destruction,</HI> so there be obscure Dispensations of Providence which we cannot fully unfold, and which the Wicked ignorantly and inconsiderately mis∣interpret, and abuse to their own Prejudice. <HI>GOD's Paths are in the great Deep, and his Footsteps are not known.</HI> The Al∣mighty sometimes <HI>hides the Face of his Throne, and makes Darkness his Pavilion.</HI> We see but some broken Shreds of the Scene of Providence in this World, and therefore are but Poor Judges of the Wis∣dom, Harmony, and Subserviency thereof to answer the great Design propos'd by God: But at the End of Time, when the whole Piece shall be opened at once to our View, then the Beauty, the Wisdom and Design thereof shall be admir'd, then we shall clearly perceive the close Connecti∣on that subsists between the several Parts of Providence, and their direct Tendency to answer the great End which Almighty GOD had in View from the Beginning, <HI>viz.</HI> His own Glory and his Peoples Ad∣vantage:
<PB N="15" REF="005695_0014_1026C0FD90F070E8"/>
That gracious comprehensive Promise of God to his People shall surely be verify'd in all the Occurrences of Pro∣vidence they meet with, which is express'd in the Epistle of <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Romans,</HI> namely, That <HI>all Things shall work toge∣ther for the Good of those that are the cal∣led according to his purpose.</HI> One Provi∣dence shall assist the Usefulness of another, notwithstanding its contrary appearance; as the several Wheels of a Watch, not∣withstanding of their contrary Motions, se∣cretly promote one Design.</P>
<P>Now the Afflictions that are sent upon the People of God are of three Kinds, namely either <HI>Chastnings</HI> for Sin, or <HI>Pre∣ventives</HI> of Sin, or <HI>Trials</HI> of their Graces.</P>
<P>Sometimes the Almighty <HI>corrects</HI> his People for Sins against Light, as a Father his Children, with a View to their Refor∣mation; and this is indeed agreeable to a gracious Promise of the New-Covenant, that if God's People sin against him, <HI>he will punish their Iniquities with Stripes, and their Transgressions with Rods, yet his Loving-kindness he will not take away, or
<PB N="16" REF="005695_0015_1026C10196CDF788"/>
suffer his Faithfulness to fail.</HI> While the Al∣mighty expresses a holy Displeasure against their Sins, in the Sufferings he inflicts for them, he shews the Love of a Father to their Persons, in making the Affliction a Medicine to cure the Disorder that pro∣cur'd it; by this saith the Prophet, <HI>shall the Iniquity of</HI> Jacob <HI>be purg'd, and this is all the Fruit to take away his Sin.</HI> More∣over the blessed God shews likewise the Love of a Father to the Afflicted, not only in mitigating the Severity of Afflicti∣ons, by <HI>staying his rough Wind in the Day of his East Wind,</HI> but also in comforting those that are under them by his divine Influence; when <HI>Afflictions</HI> abound often∣times <HI>Consolations do superabound:</HI> And truly Brethren Afflictions are so far from being Evidences of God's Hatred, that they are rather Signs of his Love and Care; for as the Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> informs us, <HI>whom the Lord loveth he chast∣neth, and scourgeth every Son whom he re∣ceiveth; but if ye be without Chastisement, then are ye Bastards and not Sons; and tho' no chastning for the present seem to be joy∣ous
<PB N="17" REF="005695_0016_1026C1050AA3E468"/>
but grievous, nevertheless afterwards it yieldeth the peaceable Fruits of Righteous∣ness, unto them that are exercised thereby.</HI></P>
<P>Again, I may observe, that Afflictions are sent sometimes to prevent Sin in time coming, in the People of God, and not as a Chastning for Sin past; this seemed to be the Case of <HI>Paul,</HI> whom a <HI>Messenger of Satan was sent to buffet, least he should be lifted up above Measure:</HI> What the particular Affliction was that Satan inflicted we cannot certainly determine, neither is it material for us to know: But thus far is certain, that it was something painful, and of a humbling Tendency; and that sent with this Design (by the Almighty) <HI>viz.</HI> to prevent the Apostle's being proud of the Abundance of Revelations which he had.</P>
<P>Once more, another Kind of Afflictions sent upon the People of God are <HI>Trials;</HI> this was the Case of <HI>Job,</HI> a Complication of Distresses assailed him in a little Time; the <HI>Sabeans robb'd him of his Oxen and Asses, and slew his Servants. The Fire of God</HI> (by which I believe we are to under∣stand
<PB N="18" REF="005695_0017_1026C106C4C74FF8"/>
the fiery Meteor of Lightning) <HI>fell upon his Sheep, and Servants that attended them, and consum'd them, and one only was left to tell the doleful Tidings.</HI> His Sons and Daughters in the midst of their Merriment were suddenly <HI>struck dead,</HI> by the Fall of the House where they were, occasion'd by a violent Wind. All these Afflictions came in a thick Succession, and trod as it were upon the Heels of each other. Soon after these his whole Body was cover'd with painful Boyls, and his Mind distressed with a Sense of God's Anger, of which <HI>Job</HI> especially complains in the following Language of Agony and bitter Passion; <HI>O that my Grief were thoroughly weighed, and my Calamities laid in the Ballances together; for now it would be heavier than the Sand of the Sea, therefore my Words are swallow∣ed up, for the Arrows of the Almighty are within me, the Poyson whereof drinketh up my Spirits, the Terrors of God do set them∣selves in array against me.</HI></P>
<P>And that which aggravated <HI>Job's</HI> Cala∣mity, was the Conduct of his Friends; who instead of asswaging his Sorrow by
<PB N="19" REF="005695_0018_1026C108617C1138"/>
proper Lenitives, poured Vinegar and Nitre into his Wounds; they try'd by all the Arts of Perswasion, to prove him to be a Hypocrite by his uncommon Sufferings; this <HI>Job</HI> with Justice oppos'd, and assur'd them that <HI>he would not let his Integrity go, neither should his Heart reproach him as long as he liv'd.</HI> And farther informs them, that the wicked are sometimes easy and prosperous, in the following strong Lines; <HI>Wherefore do the Wicked live, become old, yea are mighty in Power? Their Seed is establish'd in their Sight with them, and their Offspring before their Eyes, their Houses are safe from Fear, neither is the Rod of God upon them; their Bull gendreth and failleth not, their Cow calveth and casteth not her Calf, they send forth their little Ones like a Flock, and their Children dance, they take up the Timbrel and Harp, and rejoice at the Sound of the Organ, they spend their Days in Wealth, and in a Moment go down to the Grave.</HI></P>
<P>Surely if any Afflictions on account of their Number, Weight, or sudden Manner of Infliction, deserve the Name of Judg∣ments,
<PB N="20" REF="005695_0019_1026C10CED8ED398"/>
these might be so called that were inflicted upon <HI>Job,</HI> and yet if the Judg∣ment of God himself may be allowed suf∣ficient to determine the Point, they were so far from proving <HI>Job</HI> to be a Hypocrite, as his Friends uncharitably and vainly imagin'd, that they were not sent for any Sin that he had done, but for the Trial of his Graces; <HI>Ye have heard of the Pa∣tience of</HI> Job, says the Apostle <HI>James, and seen the End of the Lord;</HI> that is, the De∣sign of God in sending Afflictions upon him, was to try his Patience. Tho' <HI>Job</HI> shew'd human Weakness in his Troubles, yet he wou'd not reject his God, and re∣nounce his Religion: And his vindicating himself against the false Accusations of his Friends, and shewing that it was for no extraordinary Evil he had committed, that those Calamities were inflicted: I say this Vindication was approv'd of by the Almighty.</P>
<P>I proceed to say, that the Afflictions of the Wicked, are Judgments properly so call'd, because they proceed from Wrath, and being unsanctify'd are often a prelude
<PB N="21" REF="005695_0020_1026C10F804DA6E8"/>
to their Ruin; <HI>they are set in slippery Places, from whence they fall headlong into Destruction.</HI> Yea all that they meet with is in Judgment, especially after they reject God's Calls, and quench his gracious Ope∣rations. When God afflicts them it is in the Quality of a Judge, as a proper Pu∣nishment for Sin; and indeed their Want of Affliction, is one of the sorest Judg∣ments, and hence the Almighty threaten'd the People of <HI>Israel, that he wou'dn't pu∣nish their Sons and Daughters any more, for they would revolt more and more.</HI> And elsewhere Jehovah speaks to the same purpose; <HI>Because I have purg'd them and they were not purged, therefore will I not purge them any more until I cause my Fury to rest upon them.</HI> Ephraim <HI>is joined to Idols, let him alone. Let him that is unjust be unjust still, let him that is filthy, be filthy still.</HI> This is just like a Physicians aban∣doning all Care of a distemper'd Patient, prescribing no more bitter Potions to him, but letting him live according to his Fancy, which is an awful Presage of Death. The Honours Profits and Pleasures of ungodly
<PB N="22" REF="005695_0021_1026C11232D9F990"/>
Men, tho' in themselves they be Blessings, yet to them, being abus'd, they become Judg∣ments; <HI>the Prosperity of Fools,</HI> as <HI>Solomon</HI> observes, <HI>destroys them. And because they have no Changes,</HI> as the Psalmist speaks, <HI>therefore they fear not God.</HI></P>
<P>But on the contrary, the Afflictions of the Righteous, however sudden and great they be, tho' as to the Matter of them, because afflictive to Sense, they be call'd Judgments; and hence <HI>Judgment</HI> is said to <HI>begin at the House of God;</HI> and <HI>David</HI> resolv'd to <HI>sing of Mercy and of Judgment:</HI> Yet in respect of their Principle and Issue, their Spring and Scope, they are Covenant-Mercies; they proceed from the fatherly Love of God and terminate in their real Benefit.</P>
<P>I proceed now to the Improvement of this Subject. And.</P>
<P><HI>First:</HI> If the Case be so <HI>that all Things come alike to all,</HI> then surely the Liberty that some take in censuring Professors of Religion, (under uncommon Calamities) in respect of their State and Actions is ve∣ry unjustifiable and sinful, especially if their Lives be blameless; and yet it is almost
<PB N="23" REF="005695_0022_1026C113C2EE9470"/>
as common as it is uncharitable and un∣reasonable. When <HI>Paul</HI> after a dangerous Voyage, had reach'd the Island of <HI>Melita,</HI> and a Viper had fastened on his Hand, the <HI>Pagan</HI> Inhabitants soon pass'd a severe Censure upon him; they judged him to be a very wicked Man, and that tho' he escap'd the Dangers of the Seas, yet divine Vengeance wou'dn't suffer him to live: But when they saw that he surviv'd, they soon chang'd their Opinion, with as little Judgment, to the contrary Extreme!</P>
<P>It seems by what our Lord observes in the 13th of <HI>Luke,</HI> that some of the <HI>Jews</HI> imagined that those Galileans whom <HI>Pilate</HI> slew, as they were sacrificing, were se∣cretly wicked Men; but our Lord op∣poses their unjust Censure in the following Manner, <HI>And JESUS answering said un∣to them, suppose ye that these</HI> Galileans <HI>were Sinners above all the</HI> Galileans, <HI>because they suffered such Things, I tell you nay, but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish.</HI> Possibly the <HI>Jews</HI> were enduc'd to pass so hard a Cen∣sure upon the violent Death of the <HI>Galileans,</HI> because they were not of their Sect or
<PB N="24" REF="005695_0023_1026C1178DBC4FC8"/>
Party, or had some debate with them. To silence this, our Lord propos'd an Instance of 18 of their own Party, upon whom the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>Siloam fell; think ye,</HI> says Christ, <HI>that they were Sinners above all that dwelt at</HI> Jerusalem? <HI>I tell you nay, but except ye repent ye shall all like∣wise Perish.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Doctor <HI>Lightfoot</HI> thinks, that this Tower, adjoyn'd to the Pool of <HI>Siloam,</HI> which is the same with the Pool of <HI>Be∣thesda,</HI> where the impotent Folk waited for the moving of the Waters, so that those who were kill'd by the Fall of the Tower, were probably some of them, or some who in this Pool purified them∣selves for the Temple Service, it being near the Temple.</Q> Now while they were thus in the Way of their Duty, this sad Accident happened, <HI>As the Birds are caught in a snare, so are the Sons of Men snared in an evil Time, when it comes sudden∣ly upon them,</HI> says <HI>Solomon.</HI> These Instan∣ces sufficiently prove, that we cannot judge of Mens Sins by their Sufferings in this World; for many are thrown into the
<PB N="25" REF="005695_0024_1026C11A0E23E750"/>
Furnace as Gold, to be purify'd, and not as Dross and Chaff to be consumed. This should therefore give check to unreasona∣ble Censures, for hereby we are in Danger of condemning those whom God Justifies, and bringing Guilt upon our own Minds.</P>
<P>Seeing Almighty God sends Afflictions for various Ends, that Charity, which hopes all Things, should incline us to choose the most favourable Side, except we have very evident Reasons to the Contrary.</P>
<P>And yet, in nothing more do many in∣dulge a wild and ungovernable Loose, than in rash judging and severely censuring Persons under Calamities. Hereby they do, as far as in them lies, the unfriendly Office of Persecuting, or adding Affliction to the Afflicted: Hereby they <HI>wound those that God hath smitten.</HI> Such Treatment they would not like in their own Case, which they know not how soon it may be, seeing they have no greater Protection from Accidents than others.</P>
<P>While the Prophane Herd, from an in∣veterate Prejudice against Religion, express such Sarcasms and Censures on the aforesaid
<PB N="26" REF="005695_0025_1026C11BB0001DD0"/>
Occasion, as are inconsistent with the Laws of Humanity and common Decen∣cy, the ignorant Bigots of particular Par∣ties boldly invade the divine Prerogative, and assert that such Calamities are Judg∣ments inflicted upon Persons for their op∣posing their Sect, Opinions, or Humours, as if they were forsooth of God's Council, and knew all the secret Springs of his Providence.</P>
<P>I think it is a just and unexceptionable Maxim, that the less Reason and Argu∣ment any Men or Party have to offer for their Principles and Conduct, the more they are enclin'd to rash judging and se∣vere Censure upon others that differ from them, having nothing that is solid to offer in their own Vindication, they make rail∣ing supply the Room of Argument. And truly, in general, the less Knowledge, Ex∣perience, and true Goodness men have, the more they are dispos'd to rash judging and severe censure: But increase of Know∣ledge and Grace makes Men merciful, as their heavenly Father is Merciful. In short, rash judging and censuring of others is a Satyr upon our selves, it loudly pro∣claims
<PB N="27" REF="005695_0026_1026C11E6F801090"/>
our Ignorance, Weakness in Grace, or total want of it: <HI>The Heart of the Righ∣teous studieth to answer,</HI> (says <HI>Solomon) but the Mouth of the Wicked poureth out evil Things.</HI></P>
<P>But the Folly, the Sinfulness, and Dan∣ger of rash judging and censuring the afflicted, is represented in strong and beau∣tiful Colours in the Book of <HI>Job.</HI> There all that can be said in support of it is offer'd at large, with much Fire and Fine∣ness of Diction, and it is fully and fairly confuted according to the Judgment of God himself, whose wrath was kindled against <HI>Eliphaz</HI> the <HI>Temanite, Bildad</HI> the <HI>Sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>hite,</HI> and <HI>Zophar</HI> the <HI>Namathite</HI> for not speak∣ing of him the Thing that was right, as his Servant <HI>Job</HI> did: They were, therefore, enjoin'd to offer Sacrifices, and get <HI>Job</HI> to Pray for them, least God should deal with them after their Folly. (<HI>See</HI> Job <HI>Chap.</HI> 42.)</P>
<P>It is strange indeed that the Disciples of Christ, who had the Advantage of the Book of <HI>Job</HI> to instruct them, should be at a Loss about the blind Man, as we find they were, (<HI>John</HI> ix.) <HI>And as JESUS passed by, he saw a Man which was blind
<PB N="28" REF="005695_0027_1026C122D6612BF8"/>
from his Birth, and his Disciples ask'd him saying, Who did Sin, this Man or his Pa∣rents that he is born blind? JESUS an∣swered, neither this Man sinned, nor his Parents, but that the Works of God should be manifest in him.</HI></P>
<P>The Disciples it seems took it for grant∣ed that that extraordinary Calamity was the Punishment of some extraordinary Crime, which was very Censorious. This Divinity they had probably learn'd of the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> who told the blind Man, when he spoke ho∣nourably of CHRIST, <HI>Thou wast altogether born in Sin, and dost thou teach us?</HI> But our Lord on the Contrary inform'd them, <HI>that neither this Man had sin'd, nor his Parents,</HI> (that is, in an extraordinary Degree, so as to Occasion the Calamity inflicted,) <HI>but</HI> it was <HI>that the Works of God might be made mani∣fest in him.</HI> That is, that our Lord might have the Opportunity of curing him in a Miraculous Way, and so of confirming the Verity of his divine Mission and Doctrine.</P>
<P>The unsearchable Depths and Difficul∣ties of Divine Providence, may be re∣solv'd into this: That God hereby de∣signs
<PB N="29" REF="005695_0028_1026C1245CA271C0"/>
to manifest his Sovereignty and Glory, while ordinary Events are pass'd over with Silence and Neglect, extraordinary Inci∣dents are sent to summons the Notice of a secure World. Almighty God has such absolute Propriety in, and uncontroul'd Sovereignty over all his Creatures, that he may make them serve his Honour, either by doing or suffering, in such a Way as he thinks fit: And surely if God be glorify'd by us either actively or passively, we are not made in vain.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly: Do all Things come alike to all?</HI> Then let it be observ'd for the Support and Consolation of such as fear God, and Terror of the Impenitent, that Things will not be always thus. It is reasonable it should be so, in this World at least gene∣rally, because it is but a State of Trial; and because Afflictions are many Ways useful to pious Souls; hereby their Pride is humbled and other Corruptions morti∣fy'd; hereby their Faith and Patience and other Graces are exercis'd; hereby they are excited to a more affectionate Per∣formance of religious Duty; hereby they
<PB N="30" REF="005695_0029_1026C1261CF09990"/>
are more weaned from this World, and the Thoughts of Heaven endear'd to them.</P>
<P>Tho' Events are mix'd here, when the next State commences there shall be a wide and visible Difference; very different Re∣wards shall then be dispens'd, according to Mens different States and Actions; the Righteous shall be cloath'd with Honour and Dignity, and admitted into everlasting Rest and Pleasure, while the Wicked shall be rais'd to Shame and Contempt, and rack'd with the accutest Pain!</P>
<P>The believing Expectation of future Blessedness, may make us rejoice with Joy unspeakable and glorious, under all the Calamities of Life; for the Sufferings of it, which are light and but for a Moment, are not worthy to be compar'd, with that exceeding great and eternal Weight of Glory which is reserv'd for us; and there∣fore, as the Author to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> nobly observes, as on the one hand we should not <HI>despise the Chastning of the Lord,</HI> so on the other, <HI>we should not faint under it;</HI> for the same Afflictions we endure, either in kind or Measure, have been fulfill'd in
<PB N="31" REF="005695_0030_1026C129983C8B48"/>
our Brethren that have gone before us to Glory: <HI>We should not therefore think it strange concerning the fiery Trial which is to try us, as tho' some strange Thing hap∣pened unto us, but rejoice in as much as we are partakers of Christ's Sufferings;</HI> that when his Glory shall be reveal'd, we may be glad also with exceeding Joy: <HI>What tho' now for a Season, if need be, we are in heaviness thro' manifold Temptations, that the Tryal of our Faith, being much more precious than of Gold that perisheth, tho' it be try'd with Fire, might be found unto praise, and honour, and Glory, at the Appearing of Jesus Christ.</HI> O it is a calm∣ing comfortable Consideration in every Distress, that every Event is under the Direction and Controul of our heavenly Father, who rules all Things with uner∣ring Wisdom, irresistable Power, unspotted Holiness, inviolable Fidelity, and ineffable Goodness, to the noblest Purposes! O it is sweet to think, that we are in his Hands, who numbers the very Hairs of our Head, and presides not only over the greatest Events, but even the most minute, and
<PB N="32" REF="005695_0031_1026C12CA16E9030"/>
to our Apprehension fortuitous Incidents!</P>
<P>But on the contrary, the fearful Ex∣pectation of future Misery, after this short and transitory Scene expires, may justly allay all the present agreeable Sensations of the Impenitent: What avail such short liv'd Enjoyments, as so soon terminate in Woe and Ruin! Woe to the Wicked it shall be ill with them, for the Reward of their Hands shall be given them! But I proceed,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly: Do all Things come alike to all</HI> in the present State? Then let both Saints and Sinners be excited to prepare for every Event, yea even for the most sudden and shocking Calamities.</P>
<P>Let pious Souls seek and strive for in∣crease of Grace and Holiness, by a right Im∣provement of all the Means of Grace, as well as of the Dealings of God in his Providence; <HI>For ye know not what a Day may bring forth.</HI> Let us therefore <HI>go with our Loyns girt, and with our Lamps burning, for we know not when the Bridegroom comes, at Midnight, Cock-crowing, or in the Morning.</HI> While we behold the great Fathers Rod in his Hand, smiting any of the Family, it should possess
<PB N="33" REF="005695_0032_1026C12F42D8D608"/>
every one of the Houshold with a Fear and Reverence of his Majesty, seeing that all are Sinners, and therefore deserve his Stroaks.</P>
<P>And surely Brethren, those that are in a State of Sin are loudly call'd upon, by the Calamities of others to repent of their Sins, and seek an Interest in the pardoning Mercy of God: And this is indeed the Use that Christ himself made of the Judg∣ments of God recorded in the xiiith. of <HI>Luke,</HI> when he had mentioned the Case of those that were slain by <HI>Pilate,</HI> and by the Fall of the Tower of <HI>Siloam,</HI> he took occasion therefrom to excite all, both Saints and Sinners to Repentance, by assuring them, <HI>that except they repented, they should all likewise perish. If Judgment begins at the House of God, what shall the End be of those that obey not the Gospel of God? If the Righteous are scarcely saved, where shall the Ungodly and Sinner appear?</HI> If a pious Person dies suddenly, he will immediate∣ly pass into a State of Glory and Bless; but if ye unregenerate Sinners die in your present Condition, ye will be unalterably fix'd in a State of unexpressible Misery, beyond all Hopes of Recovery: O dread∣ful
<PB N="34" REF="005695_0033_1026C130D2F950A8"/>
Thought! Sirs, not only Saints but Sin∣ners are expos'd to the awful Artillery of Heaven, the Thunder. Now if ye should be struck dead by it in your Impenitence, which you know not but you may in a little Time, except you improve the pre∣sent gliding Moments to better purpose; consider your selves the rueful Consequen∣ces, which I at present forbear to express. <HI>Behold now is the acceptable Time, behold now is the Day of Salvation!</HI> Therefore Sirs, it will be your Wisdom and Interest, to forbear uncharitable Reflections upon others Sentiments and Conduct, and instead thereof let every one try to know the Plague-Sore of his own Heart, and reform his own Practice.</P>
<P>You are all aware, my Friends and Bre∣thren, that the late Stroak of the Light∣ning which I have sustain'd, has given rise to these Meditations. I may assure you Sirs, that what I have spoken against Censuring in this Discourse, has not arisen from any Fear of it, or Uneasiness oc∣casioned by it, so far as it respects myself; <HI>for to me it is a little Thing, to be judged by you, or by Man's Judgment;</HI> but Con∣science
<PB N="35" REF="005695_0034_1026C13412E39628"/>
of Duty to God and Man, has con∣strain'd me to speak thus.—</P>
<P>Concerning this Dispensation of Provi∣dence, give me leave to say, that I ac∣knowledge to the Glory of God the Righ∣teousness of it: I am a Sinner, and as such, deserve all Manner of Miseries in this Life, and eternal Ruin in that to come. But in the mean time I must declare, that I am not conscious of any extraordinary Evil in my Conduct, for which this was sent. I have a Witness in Heaven, and one upon Earth, that I have been enabled to be up∣right before God in the Course of my Life, aiming at JEHOVAH's Glory, and his Kingdom's Good; and at the very Time when this was inflicted, I enjoy'd Peace of Mind, and Nearness to God; and presently after it, I had a Sense of the Love of God as a Father, and Willing∣ness to resign my Life, and my all into his Hands: My Soul experienc'd a humble Reverence of God's Majesty, and a sweet Complacence in his Dealings with me in general, and particularly in this Providence, and was therefore enclin'd a few Hours after, to bless his Name for it with my
<PB N="36" REF="005695_0035_1026C1378A2050D0"/>
whole Heart; and therefore the various, unreasonable and inconsistent Censures of People upon this Occasion, give me not the least Uneasiness, so far as they concern me, but I am griev'd for their sinful Igno∣rance, and Uncharitableness, as they re∣spect themselves, and pray that a gracious God may forgive them, for they know not what they do.</P>
<P>I hope, my Brethren, you will excuse my saying thus much concerning my self, which if I had not judg'd to be my Duty at this Time, when so many false and foolish Censures are heap'd upon me, on Account of this late awful Dispensation of Providence, I should have wholly wav'd.</P>
<P>And as I do not yet know, what is the particular Voice of this Providence to me, I beg the Help of your Prayers, that I may be enabled to know it, so far as con∣cerns my Duty, and to comply therewith.</P>
<P>So far as I know my Heart, I desire to bow with the most awful Reverence before the Sovereign Majesty of Heaven, and re∣sign myself to his Government and Disposal.</P>
<P>I desire likewise to take thankful Notice of that Mixture of Mercy which appear'd
<PB N="37" REF="005695_0036_1026C13A09A14948"/>
in this Providence in sparing my Life, and preserving my Bones from being bro∣ken, while the Flash of the Lighting was so violent as to tear my shoes to Pieces, twist one of my Buckles, and melt a little of two Corners of the other. Surely the blessed God has according to his gracious Word <HI>stayed his rough Wind in the Day of his East Wind.</HI> That which makes the Mitigation of the Stroak the more agreea∣ble to me, is the Opportunity that is here∣by offered of farther Service to the Church of Christ, and the Prevention of a great∣ter Degree of Reproach, which would in all probability have been, tho' without Ground, cast upon my Character, and thro' that upon the Truths and People of God, had I been struck dead by the Lightning at a Stroak, tho' I trust it would have been the best Day to me that ever I saw, yet the wicked would have taken thence Occasion to triumph and reproach without Cause; the Hearts of many pious People would have been griev'd, and the Weaker amongst them possibly put to a Plunge to answer the Cavils of the Impe∣nitent: It has therefore pleas'd a graci∣ous
<PB N="38" REF="005695_0037_1026C13C8A4764B8"/>
GOD to lengthen out the Thread of my Life a little longer. O may it be im∣prov'd to better Purpose in the Service of his Honour, Truths and Kingdom!</P>
<P>I pray God that all who hear of this uncommon Event, and especially the dear People of my Charge, may be enabled to improve it to God's Honour, and their own Benefit. It seems, my Brethren, as if the Time in which it was inflicted, be∣ing the Hour of your Publick Convention, when I was wont to speak to you in my Masters Name, pointed to you to take suitable Notice of this Providence.</P>
<P>Seeing my dear Brethren it has pleased Almighty God to threaten to remove from you at a Stroak, the Dispenser of the means of Grace among you, I hope it will ex∣cite you to improve with greater Attention and Care, such Opportunities in time com∣ing; forasmuch as they are so exceeding uncertain, and yet of such great Moment.</P>
<P>And Brethren, I think I am bound by the Laws of Gratitude to take this publick Opportunity of expressing my Thankfulness for your uncommon Sympathy with me, and Kindness to me under the gentle touch
<PB N="39" REF="005695_0038_1026C13F5A7715E0"/>
of a Father's Hand. Ye have not treated me with the uncharitable Severity of <HI>Job</HI>'s Friends, but with Lenity and Indulgence, the Law of Kindness has mov'd your Lips; neither have ye been asham'd of my Chain. May it please a good GOD to reward you for all the Expressions of your Respect to me, and keep you from an undue Esteem of me, who am less than the least of all Saints.</P>
<P>In fine Sirs, let us all be excited to listen to and improve the awful Voice of God by Thunder in general. <HI>Give unto the Lord O ye mighty, give unto the Lord Glory and Strength, give unto the Lord the Glory due unto his Name, worship the Lord in the Beauty of Holiness, the Voice of the Lord is upon the Waters, the GOD of Glory thun¦dereth, the Voice of the Lord is powerful, the Voice of the Lord is full of Majesty, the Voice of the Lord breaketh the Cedars, yea the Lord breaketh the Cedars of</HI> Lebanon, <HI>he maketh them also to skip like a Calf,</HI> Le∣banon <HI>and</HI> Syrion <HI>like a young Unicorn; the Voice of the Lord divides the Flames of Fire, shakes the Wilderness of</HI> Kadesh, <HI>makes the Hinds to calve, and discovers the
<PB N="40" REF="005695_0039_1026C141DD181EC0"/>
Forest.</HI> It is but reasonable my Brethren, that we should offer Homage to that great God, who is All-sufficient in himself, and whose Majestick Voice in the Thunder, produces such sudden and amazing Effects and Alterations in the Kingdoms of Nature and Providence, as have been represent∣ed. Who can stand before this Holy Lord God, when once his Anger begins to burn? He is wise in Heart and mighty in Strength: Who has hardned himself a∣gainst God and prospered? But tho' our Hearts should be fill'd with a solemn Awe of God's Majesty while we hear his Voice thundering in the Heavens, yet let the Friends of God beware of a slavish Dread of God's Judgments, and Diffidence in his Word; and let them sweetly resign themselves by Faith into their Father's Hands, humbly adoring and silently sub∣mitting to his unerring Disposals, which are always Wise, and Just, and Good. <HI>Our God is a Rock, his Ways are Perfect, a God of Truth, and without Iniquity, just and right is he.</HI> I add no more, but Glo∣ry and Praise to God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, for ever and ever, to which let Men and Angels say, AMEN.</P>
