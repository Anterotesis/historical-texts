<HEAD>To the HONOURABLE <HI>Samuel Holden,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> of <HI>LONDON:</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE generous Things You have been doing from Year to Year for <HI>my Coun∣try;</HI> for many of the <HI>Churches of Christ</HI> in it, whom You have enrich'd with Means of <HI>sacred Knowledge</HI> and <HI>practi∣cal Religion;</HI> and for the <HI>pious Poor</HI> in it, both <HI>Ministers</HI> and <HI>Others,</HI> who have tasted of your Bounties and their Souls have blessed You; have led me into this open Acknowledgment, to the Glory of God, from whose Hands we would receive what You and Others have sent us from Time to Time, <HI>an Odour of a sweet Smell, a Sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="ii" REF="004002_0004_10037F06D69BAC88"/>
Sir, I hold my Self highly indebted to the Go∣verning Providence of a gracious <HI>God,</HI> which led me in my Youth from my <HI>Native Land</HI> to see That of our <HI>Fathers Sepulchres;</HI> and in my Way thither was pleas'd to <HI>strip</HI> me of the Little I had, that I might be invited by the excellent <HI>Saint</HI> your dear <HI>Mother,</HI> who <HI>took in the Stranger,</HI> and for a Course of Years together regarded him as a <HI>Son,</HI> while her Soul longed after <HI>You</HI> at <HI>Riga.</HI></P>
<P>What the <HI>Holy God</HI> was then doing I could little know at the Time, but He has made me to per∣ceive since, "That He led me into Mr. <HI>Parkhurst</HI>'s House, and from thence to <HI>Bath,</HI> to bring me into a more immediate &amp; extensive Acquaintance with <HI>Persons of Distinction for Learning and Religion,</HI> for my greater <HI>Usefulness</HI> in the Times that have passed over me, and to be <HI>the Hand</HI> thro' which his pur∣posed Benefactions to our <HI>College,</HI> to many of our <HI>Towns</HI> and <HI>Churches,</HI> and to many poor <HI>Members of Christ</HI> in these Parts, should flow.</P>
<P>By the Help of God, I humbly hope that I have willingly done the Part of a <HI>faithful Almoner,</HI> as well in <HI>advising</HI> when I have been writ to as in <HI>observing the Directions</HI> of Those who have intrusted me; which is all the <HI>Honour</HI> I may pretend to in <HI>the Administration of this Service, which is abundant by many Thanksgivings to God;</HI> some of <HI>which</HI> You have seen and read, as from the Hand of worthy <HI>Mini∣sters,</HI> so <HI>One</HI> especially from the <HI>Angelick Pen of a<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mrs. <HI>Gerrish</HI> of <HI>Cambridge.</HI></NOTE> Gentlewoman,</HI> who <HI>in the School of Affliction</HI> made a Proficiency in <HI>Grace</HI> and sacred <HI>Science,</HI> even beyond all that <HI>the School of the Prophets</HI> among us has been able to boast! and as soon almost as <HI>She</HI> had wrote what I sent You, lay down and <HI>died</HI> in perfect Peace.</P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="004002_0005_10037F0DD6408880"/>
I know Sir You are no Stranger to <HI>the Profusion of Bounties</HI> which for a Course of many Years our <HI>College</HI> received from the most pious and munifi∣cent <HI>Thomas Hollis,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> whose worthy <HI>Heir</HI> has soon followed him to the Grave, after he had made a good <HI>Addition</HI> to the Foundations laid by his <HI>Uncle,</HI> and adorn'd us with a rare <HI>Orrery;</HI> and now we have the Tydings of the Death of <HI>John Hollis,</HI> <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> the worthy <HI>Brother</HI> of our great Benefactor, and a <HI>Heir</HI> with him of the same <HI>Grace;</HI> who was also a <HI>Father</HI> to poor <HI>Orphans</HI> here, as well as at Home.</P>
<P>And if it were permitted me, I would now have named <HI>Another,</HI> a younger <HI>Gentleman,</HI> whom God has <HI>inrich'd with all Bountifulness</HI> us-ward; of whose Liberality our <HI>Churches</HI> and our <HI>Poor</HI> have hereto∣fore largely tasted; and this Year brings me the Joy of an <HI>Order</HI> from him for schooling, cloathing, feeding and lodging of <HI>twenty Indian Children</HI> at <HI>Hossatonnoc,</HI> a <HI>Tribe</HI> who have lately received the Gospel with a marvelous Joy, and are now under the <HI>Pastoral Care</HI> of the Reverend and Learned Mr. <HI>John Sargent.</HI></P>
<P>You will easily think, Sir, how placid the <HI>Sur∣prise</HI> of such a Benefaction is, and tho' I see not how the <HI>Donor</HI> of so public a Charity can be kept <HI>secret,</HI> any more than <HI>a City set on a Hill can be hid;</HI> yet the <HI>Thing</HI> ought to be told to the Glory of God, and in this open Manner I would let the <HI>hidden Donor</HI> know the Sense we have of the <HI>Goodness of GOD</HI> to us thro' Him, and our <HI>Prayers</HI> for Him, that <HI>his Father which seeth in secret will reward him openly.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="004002_0006_10035E7943E7C568"/>
I own, Sir, that I mean a <HI>Dedication</HI> of the fol∣lowing <HI>Discourse</HI> to this nameless <HI>Benefactor</HI> also, who would account it an Honour to be nam'd after <HI>You;</HI> Whom God has set in the <HI>Chair</HI> among your Brethren the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> and honoured You before the Greatest Men at <HI>Court</HI> as well as in the <HI>City,</HI> for Wisdom, Modesty and Integrity.</P>
<P>That your <HI>Days</HI> may be multiplied, even cross to your own <HI>Wishes</HI> of a speedy Entrance on a bet∣ter Life; for your greater and longer <HI>Usefulness</HI> in your Generation, and your more abundant <HI>Reward</HI> in the Day of Christ; and that a gracious God may also please to <HI>multiply Grace and Peace</HI> unto our <HI>Other Benefactors,</HI> is the hearty Prayer of,</P>

<HEAD>To the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of the Town of <HI>Boston,</HI> who usually attend the <HI>weekly Lecture,</HI> And to <HI>Those</HI> in particular who attend the <HI>Quarterly Meetings</HI> for <HI>Collections</HI> for the <HI>Poor</HI> in <HI>Cornhill.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN the following <HI>Discourse</HI> was preach'd to <HI>You,</HI> a part of it at the <HI>public Lecture,</HI> and a part in your more <HI>private Meeting,</HI> You were then ad∣dress'd in the <HI>Close</HI> of those <HI>Sermons</HI> in the following <HI>Words,</HI> which I think good <HI>now</HI> to bring to your <HI>Remembrance,</HI> and also to lay before Others.</P>
<Q><P>I speak unto a <HI>Trading Town,</HI> and I thank God unto a <HI>People</HI> us'd to <HI>Charities</HI> and <HI>liberal Things.</HI> Need I provoke you to <HI>Emulation</HI> by what is
<PB N="ii" REF="004002_0008_10037F2263D92F60"/>written of the Men of <HI>Tyre?</HI> And God forbid that <HI>they</HI> should <HI>rise up in Judgment against Us, and condemn us.</HI> Shall not <HI>your</HI> Merchandize and <HI>your</HI> Hire be <HI>Holiness to the Lord,</HI> when <HI>theirs</HI> was so, when the <HI>Gospel</HI> came among them! Surely <HI>we</HI> have carried <HI>our Profession</HI> as high, and <HI>our Ob∣ligations</HI> are at least as great as Those of <HI>Tyre and Sidon.</HI></P>
<P>One <HI>natural Benefit</HI> of Trade and Commerce to any People is, that it <HI>enlarges their Hearts to do generous Things.</HI> God grant that every Thing of that Nature done among us or <HI>by O∣thers for us,</HI> may be so done as to carry in their <HI>Front</HI> the glorious <HI>Inscription</HI> of HOLINESS TO GOD. So let it be in your <HI>secret Gifts</HI> and Dis∣tributions, so in your private and more bounti∣ful <HI>Subscriptions and Collections,</HI> whether they be for God's <HI>Poor</HI> or for his <HI>Worship.</HI> And I wish the <HI>Proposals</HI> which were lately printed for the yearly Gathering a small <HI>Stock</HI> or <HI>Fund</HI> in parti∣cular <HI>Congregations</HI> for pious and charitable Uses, might find <HI>Acceptance</HI> in our Churches, and prove a happy <HI>Means</HI> of fulfilling my <HI>Text</HI> among us.</P>
<P>But there is <HI>one</HI> Thing, the Work and Duty of the present <HI>Day,</HI> which I may not <HI>omit,</HI> if I would be <HI>just</HI> either to my <HI>Text</HI> or to my <HI>Country;</HI> which is — <HI>That your Merchandize and Hire must be for Them which dwell before the Lord, to eat suffi∣ciently and for durable Clothing.</HI> How shall it be called <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI> without this? You must make Conscience of supporting your <HI>Mini∣sters,</HI> who serve in the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> and at the <HI>Altar</HI> of God. Money <HI>falls,</HI> you all <HI>raise</HI> your Mer∣chandise,
<PB N="iii" REF="004002_0009_10037F2AF223D890"/>and you are <HI>unjust to Christ</HI> and <HI>his</HI> Mi∣sters, (that is to say <HI>unholy</HI>) if you do not <HI>raise</HI> their Support. It is impossible that <HI>They</HI> should <HI>eat</HI> sufficiently, or have <HI>Clothing</HI> for their Families, if their Support rise not while all your Trade and Hire <HI>rises</HI> after so prodigious a Manner. This is to your poor <HI>Ministers,</HI> like a <HI>hundred</HI> lit∣tle Streams uniting on <HI>them,</HI> and bearing them away as with a <HI>Flood;</HI> or like <HI>a sweeping Rain</HI> that <HI>leaves no Food.</HI> You must up instantly or it will <HI>wash away</HI> the Field of God, his <HI>Worship</HI> from off the Face of the Land. You must minister more of your rising Hire to the <HI>Temple</HI> of God, or let drop any Pretence to my <HI>Text.</HI></P>
<P>This Matter belongs in the first place to the <HI>Government</HI> over us, who have had it under Con∣sideration in their present <HI>Session</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1725.</NOTE> and piously <HI>resolved,</HI> That it is the <HI>Indispensable Duty</HI> of the several <HI>Towns, Precincts</HI> and <HI>Parishes</HI> of the <HI>Pro∣vince,</HI> to make such <HI>Additions to the Salaries or Maintenance</HI> of their respective <HI>Ministers,</HI> as may honourably support and encourage them in their Work: The <HI>Court</HI> did therefore most earnestly recommend a speedy and chearful Compliance with this their <HI>Judgment,</HI> to the several <HI>Congrega∣tions</HI> and <HI>Religious Assemblies</HI> within the Province.</P>
<P>To <HI>Them</HI> it indeed belongs nextly and more immediately, whose Profession in a <HI>Church-State</HI> is this <HI>Holiness to the Lord;</HI> and it is the Duty of the respective <HI>Members</HI> in every Congregation to see to it that <HI>their Merchandise and Husbandry</HI> be so, and that <HI>their Pastors</HI> have <HI>Meat sufficient</HI> and <HI>durable Clothing.</HI> — For with what Face and
<PB N="iv" REF="004002_0010_10035E8B240C7078"/>Conscience shall every One of you rise a <HI>Penny</HI> or a <HI>Shilling</HI> in your Hire and Merchandise. Year after Year, and not rise also in the Support of your <HI>Ministers?</HI> I leave it to the <HI>Heart</HI> of every <HI>Merchant</HI> and every <HI>Labourer</HI> to judge in this Thing.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Since <HI>that Day</HI> many or most of our <HI>Churches</HI> have made considerable <HI>Additions</HI> to the Support of their <HI>Ministers,</HI> but in very few Places I think in a just <HI>Proportion</HI> to the Fall of <HI>Money,</HI> and the Rise of <HI>Goods.</HI> So that every <HI>New Year</HI> or two calls for a <HI>new Provision;</HI> such is our miserable <HI>sinking Condition;</HI> alas without Prospect of any <HI>Remedy!</HI> May the <HI>Dews of Heaven</HI> come down more abundantly on the <HI>Places</HI> that consider of it!</NOTE></P>
<P>I have but one <HI>Word</HI> more to add in this <HI>public Audience,</HI> and that concerns the <HI>College;</HI> to mind you that the many great and prudent <HI>Benefactions</HI> made of late Years to that <HI>Society,</HI> have (I trust) this <HI>Inscription</HI> of <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI> upon them. The <HI>Bounties</HI> of the pious Mr. <HI>Hollis</HI> in particular, his humble Offerings to <HI>Christ</HI> and his Munifi∣cence to <HI>us,</HI> his <HI>Lectures</HI> and devoted <HI>Students</HI> wear <HI>This</HI> on their Forehead.
<HI>"The LORD raise up of our Sons for Prophets, and of our Young Men for Nazarites. That our Sons may be as Plants of Righ∣teousness; and our Garners full, affording all Manner of Store! Happy the People that are in such a Case, yea happy is that People whose God is the Lord."</HI></P></Q>
<P>The <HI>Address</HI> to <HI>You,</HI> with which the <HI>Sermon clos'd</HI> in your <HI>private Meeting,</HI> was in the following Words,</P>
<Q><P><HI>Finally,</HI> Should our <HI>Merchandise and Hire be Holiness to the Lord?</HI> it gives a special <HI>Countenance</HI> to, and puts great <HI>Honour</HI> on, your <HI>present Meeting.</HI> This <HI>Evening Lecture</HI> is on a <HI>double</HI> Account <HI>holy</HI>
<PB N="v" REF="004002_0011_10037F391854AB10"/>to God; as in Respect of the Religious Exercise of <HI>Worship</HI> so also in Respect of our intended <HI>Col∣lection for the Poor.</HI> The <HI>Design</HI> &amp; <HI>Intention</HI> of our pre∣sent Meeting is entirely sacred to <HI>Christ</HI> &amp; to his <HI>Poor.</HI> We come to cast our <HI>Mites</HI> into the <HI>Lords Trea∣sury</HI> for the Use of the <HI>Widow</HI> &amp; the <HI>Fatherless.</HI> Let us seek the <HI>Divine Grace</HI> that we may so <HI>worship,</HI> and so <HI>give,</HI> as becometh <HI>Holiness;</HI> in holy Man∣ner, with holy Frames, from holy Principles, for holy Ends, to the Increase of holy Fruits in our Hearts &amp; Lives, to the Glory &amp; Praise of God.</P>
<P>Write now, if you please, <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI> on these <HI>Doors</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Deacon <HI>Williams</HI>'s in <HI>Cornhill.</HI></NOTE>, here opened to us for the sake of <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Devotion;</HI> which <HI>two</HI> will never <HI>fail,</HI> no not when <HI>Faith</HI> and <HI>Hope</HI> shall cease, within the <HI>Holy of Holies.</HI> The <HI>Rich</HI> are invited hither, not for their <HI>own</HI> so much as for the <HI>Poors</HI> sake. <HI>The Bowels of the Poor are refreshed by Thee, Brother,</HI> in your <HI>calling the Rich to your House:</HI> It is to <HI>feast the poor, the maimed, the lame and the blind,</HI> and <HI>Thou shalt be recompenced at the Resurrection of the Just.</HI></P>
<P>This <HI>Meeting</HI> is a Witness that our <HI>Widows</HI> and the <HI>Fatherless</HI> are not neglected in the daily Mi∣nistrations.

<PB N="vi" REF="004002_0012_10035E9378F15CB0"/>God has carried us thro' it, and provided for the <HI>Poor.</HI> Yet <HI>they</HI> must needs be left the more <HI>bare</HI> and necessitous, and laden with little <HI>Debts</HI> it may be, which you <HI>Brethren</HI> are now met to <HI>pay,</HI> with a willing Mind; that they may begin a <HI>New Year</HI> with <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> to God on your behalf.— I need not <HI>urge</HI> you to what you are so <HI>ready</HI> of your selves.

<HEAD>OUR <HI>Merchandise and Hire</HI> HOLINESS TO THE LORD.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Isaiah xxiii. 18.</HI></BIBL>
And her Merchandise, and her Hire shall be Holiness to the Lord.</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>YRE</HI> is the <HI>City</HI> here spoken of; and a very good and great <HI>Word</HI> it is that is here spoken of her. It is a <HI>Prophecy</HI> of the <HI>Conversion</HI> of the <HI>Ty∣rians</HI> by the preached <HI>Gos∣pel;</HI> and how they should use their <HI>Wealth</HI> in the Day when God should convert them. And what is here written concern∣ing them is for our learning, being a Direction and Precept to us, that <HI>our</HI> Merchandise and Hire should be <HI>Holiness to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004002_0014_10037F50AC2D3FF8"/>
<HI>Tyre</HI> was a <HI>Gentile City</HI> of great <HI>Antiquity,</HI> and Re∣nown for <HI>Trade</HI> and Wealth, scituate on the <HI>Me∣diterranean Sea,</HI> near to the Lot of the Tribe of <HI>Asher.</HI> It was built by some Colony of the <HI>Zidonians,</HI> and is therefore in our Context called <HI>the Daughter of Zidon.</HI></P>
<P>In <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI>'s time we find the <HI>Tyrians</HI> faithful Allies and Friends of <HI>Israel.</HI> And as one well observes, <Q>Trading Cities seldom prove dan∣gerous Enemies to their Neighbours; for they ac∣quire and maintain their Grandeur, not by the Conquest of others, but by Commerce with them.</Q></P>
<P>The Inhabitants of <HI>Tyre</HI> were now grown the most skilful in <HI>Sea Affairs</HI> of any in the World. A∣bout the ninth Year of <HI>Hezekiah, Salmanezer</HI> the <HI>Assyrian</HI> invaded and besieged them both by Sea and Land. By Sea they beat the <HI>Assyrian and Phaenician Fleet</HI> of sixty Sail, with <HI>twelve</HI> Ships only. This gave 'em a Name for <HI>War</HI> as well as Riches, and made 'em the Terror of the Ocean. The <HI>Assyrian Army</HI> then block'd 'em up by Land; for <HI>Old Tyre</HI> was built upon the <HI>Continent,</HI> and the <HI>new City</HI> after∣ward upon an <HI>Island;</HI> which <HI>Siege</HI> they bare for five Years, and were at last delivered by the Death of <HI>Salmanezer.</HI> Upon this Success they were puff'd up with new Pride, and grew hau'tier than ever, which provoked the <HI>Holy God</HI> to utter the <HI>Burden</HI> and Prophecy against them, in the <HI>Chapter</HI> before us, wherein is foretold, 1. The miserable <HI>Overthrow</HI> of the <HI>Tyrians</HI> by <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> and the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Army; and 2. Their <HI>Restoration,</HI> like their Nei'bours the <HI>Jews,</HI> after <HI>seventy</HI> Years; when they should recover their ancient <HI>Liberty, Trade</HI> &amp; <HI>Riches</HI> again — This is the Danger and Misery of Places of <HI>Commerce,</HI> that as they grow rich and <HI>opulent</HI> they
<PB N="3" REF="004002_0015_10037F5509F335F0"/>also grow <HI>sensual, prophane</HI> and <HI>insolent, unjust</HI> and unrighteous; and so <HI>forfeit</HI> the Blessings of Provi∣dence, and <HI>incur</HI> its dreadful Judgments; as <HI>Tyre</HI> did.</P>
<P><HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> found it a hard peice of Work to conquer <HI>Tyre</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the learned Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI>'s Connection of the <HI>Old and New Testament.</HI></NOTE>. He began its Siege about <HI>two</HI> Years after the Destruction of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and the Captivity of <HI>Judah.</HI> It held him <HI>thirteen</HI> Years be∣fore it was taken, when he took a terrible Revenge and utterly ras'd it. An Account of this is given us by the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> Chap. xxix. <HI>v.</HI> 18. <HI>Son of Man, Nebuchadnezzer King of Babylon caused his Army to serve a great Service against Tyre; every Head was made bald and every Shoulder was peeled; yet had he no Wages nor his Army for Tyre, for the Service that he served against it.</HI> The short Account of this Mat∣ter is, "That the <HI>Tyrians</HI> finding him too hard for them by <HI>Land,</HI> while yet they were Masters by <HI>Sea,</HI> they built themselves <HI>a new City on an Island</HI> about half a Mile distant from the Shore, into which they removed the most and best of their Effects; so that when <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> enter'd the <HI>old City,</HI> after his long Seige and hard Service of <HI>thirteen</HI> Years, he found <HI>no Riches, no Spoil</HI> in the Place, to repay him for his vast Expence or to reward his Soldiers; the Inhabitants having pass'd with their Stores into the <HI>new City,</HI> which was afterwards a most mighty <HI>Maritime Power</HI> and <HI>Mart</HI> of the Nations, still cal∣led TYRE; rising as a <HI>Phaenix</HI> from the Ashes of her <HI>Dam.</HI> — It is probable, says the noble <HI>Histo∣rian,</HI> that after the King of <HI>Babylon</HI> had destroy'd the <HI>Old Town,</HI> those that retir'd into the <HI>new</HI> one came into <HI>Terms</HI> and submitted to him; and so
<PB N="4" REF="004002_0016_10037F61DB441270"/>continued in a state of Restraint and <HI>Servitude</HI> to the <HI>Babylonians</HI> and <HI>Persians</HI> for Seventy Years; al∣tho' they were not captivated and dispersed, were not carried away to <HI>Babylon</HI> and <HI>Chaldea,</HI> as the <HI>Jews</HI> were.</P>
<P>Such was the Accomplishment of the <HI>Burden of Tyre</HI> utter'd by <HI>Isaiah!</HI> So it was <HI>laid waste,</HI> at which all her <HI>Ships</HI> are call'd to <HI>howl.</HI> This was the <HI>End</HI> of the <HI>joyous City,</HI> whose <HI>Antiquity was of ancient Days, her own Feet carry'd her away!</HI> her Pride and <HI>High∣ness</HI> of Spirit, the <HI>Sin</HI> of rich and thriving Places did it! for it presently runs a Place into Irreligion, Sensuality and Unrighteousness. The same <HI>Pride,</HI> that cast down the <HI>Angels;</HI> and destroy'd <HI>Sodom</HI> in her Fulness of Bread, leaving the polluted Cities as the <HI>Image</HI> on Earth of <HI>everlasting Burnings;</HI> laid <HI>Tyre, the crowning City,</HI> desolate; whose <HI>Merchants were Princes, and her Traffickers the honourable of the Earth:</HI> The LORD OF HOSTS <HI>did it to stain the Pride of all Glory.</HI></P>
<P>These things are written <HI>for our Warning;</HI> for a warning to the <HI>Maritime Powers of Europe,</HI> to <HI>Eng∣land</HI> and <HI>Holland</HI> in particular, on whom <HI>the Ends of the World are come.</HI> So criminal is the <HI>Pride of Life</HI> in the Eyes of a <HI>Holy God,</HI> and odious! See it in the Judgment of <HI>Tyre,</HI> as the most eminent In∣stance, <HI>Ezekiel</HI> xxviii. init. "<HI>Son of Man, say to the Prince of Tyre, Thus saith the</HI> LORD GOD, <HI>Because thine Heart is lifted up, and thou hast said, I am a God,</HI> (a kind of <HI>Neptune,</HI> God of the Seas) <HI>I sit in the Seat of God, in the midst of the Seas: Yet thou art a Man and not a God, tho' thou set thine Heart as the Heart of God: Behold thou art wiser than Daniel</HI> (who had it seems such a Name and Fame for <HI>Wisdom,</HI> thro' the King∣doms and Provinces of the <HI>East,</HI> that it might pass
<PB N="5" REF="004002_0017_10037F65728BD5A8"/>for a <HI>Proverb</HI> among them, "<HI>as wise as Daniel) and with thy Wisdom and Understanding thou hast gotten thee Riches, Gold and Silver into thy Treasuries, and thy Heart is lifted up;</HI> (art a <HI>golden God</HI> in thy own Eyes, ma∣king <HI>thy Gold thy Hope,</HI> and saying to it, <HI>"Thou art my Confidence!"</HI>) <HI>Therefore thus saith the Lord God, Be∣hold I will bring Strangers upon thee, the Terrible of the Nations, and they shall draw their Swords against the Beauty of thy Wisdom, and they shall defile thy Bright∣ness; they shall bring thee down to the Pit, and thou shalt die the Deaths of the Slain in the midst of the Seas: thou shalt be a Man and no God in the Hand of him that slayeth thee.</HI></P>
<P>All this God bro't on proud and hau'ty <HI>Tyre</HI> for her Sins. But in the <HI>Close</HI> of the <HI>Chapter,</HI> where my <HI>Text</HI> is found, we have "a <HI>Time</HI> fix'd for the Con∣tinuance of her Judgment, and a <HI>Prophecy</HI> of the Re∣covery of her ancient Glory," v. 15. <HI>Tyre shall be forgotten seventy Years, according to the Days of one King; after the End of seventy Years shall Tyre sing as an Harlot:</HI> By the Days of <HI>one King</HI> we must understand the Succession of <HI>one Family</HI> of the Monarchs of <HI>Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> his <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Grandson;</HI> and by <HI>her singing again as an Harlot,</HI> we must understand, <Q>her Return to her State of former <HI>Prosperity,</HI> Mer∣chandise and Traffic; and her using all <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Means</HI> (as she had done before) to draw Trade and Customers to her: Like as an <HI>Harlot</HI> that has been sometime under Restraint and Correc∣rection for her Leudness, when she is at Liberty again returns with a violent Bent to her old Arts of Temptation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Henry</HI> in loc.</NOTE>;</Q> <HI>Such was Tyre</HI> when at the End of 70 Years she recovered Freedom, Trade and Riches. She did all she could to <HI>allure</HI> the Com∣merce of the Nations to her again; the <HI>Tyrians</HI> were as much set upon worldly Gains, were as in∣ordinate
<PB N="6" REF="004002_0018_10037F6ED682D140"/>in their Desire and Love of Wealth, and in taking all Methods to get it, as they had been before; and <HI>rejoyced</HI> in their Acquisitions as hereto∣fore. This is the <HI>Harlotry</HI> here imputed to her, an <HI>inordinate Lust</HI> after Riches, and Pleasure in it; which in <HI>Scripture</HI> is called spiritual <HI>Fornication.</HI> And accordingly the <HI>Prophet</HI> goes on to brand and expose <HI>Tyre</HI> for her Love of Money, v. 16. "<HI>Take an Harp and go about the City, thou Harlot that hast been forgotten! make sweet Melody, sing many Songs that thou mayst be remembred.</HI> Nothing can be more <HI>elegant</HI> than this predicting" the <HI>various Artifices</HI> and even <HI>dishonest Practices,</HI> whereby the City of <HI>Tyre</HI> regain∣ing her Liberty, would return into her <HI>wonted</HI> Com∣merce with <HI>all</HI> the Nations, and <HI>entice</HI> the <HI>Merchants</HI> of the Earth into their usual Dealings with her. So <HI>she turn'd to her Hire, and committed Fornication with all the Kingdoms of the World upon the Face of the Earth,</HI> v. 17.</P>
<P>But then in the <HI>last Verse</HI> of the Chapter, which is my <HI>Text,</HI> there is <HI>one</HI> Word of <HI>Good</HI> concerning <HI>Tyre; one</HI> Word of <HI>Grace</HI> respecting her; and <HI>that</HI> is — "That having recovered her rich and opulent State, <HI>a Time</HI> would come wherein She should make <HI>a better Use of it</HI> than she had done formerly; she should in Process of Time come to <HI>use it religiously, to the Honour of God and in his Service;</HI> "Her <HI>Mer∣chandise</HI> and her <HI>Hire</HI> would then be <HI>Holiness to the Lord:</HI> And this is <HI>explained</HI> in the following Words, <HI>It shall not be treasured and laid up;</HI> neither as <HI>Misers</HI> hoard up their Bags, nor as the <HI>proud</HI> and <HI>vain</HI> lay out and lay up their Moneys in Fineries &amp; Jewels; but "<HI>her Merchandise shall be for them that dwell be∣fore the Lord,</HI> for the Support and Maintenance of <HI>Religion</HI> and the <HI>Ministers</HI> of it; for them <HI>to eat suf∣ficiently, and for durable Clothing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="004002_0019_10037F78D46D7E00"/>
What more could we hope to hear of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> the Holy City, at any time! or of any other <HI>City</HI> of God in Gospel Times! — What more than <HI>this, "Her Merchandise and her Hire shall be</HI> HOLINESS TO THE LORD? The <HI>High Priest</HI> of God, in his <HI>Attire</HI> of Holiness and Glory, on the <HI>great and solemn Day,</HI> wore no more <HI>sacred Inscription</HI> than this was! yet <HI>this</HI> shall be written on the <HI>Merchandise of Tyre!</HI> marvellous <HI>Word!</HI> written for the Generati∣ons <HI>to come,</HI> and that <HI>the People to be created should praise the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>when</HI> was this to be? and <HI>wherein</HI> should it be so? — Why, In the Day when <HI>Tyre,</HI> and other <HI>Nations,</HI> should come, 1. <HI>Not to treasure up</HI> their Gains, from a Spirit of Covetousness, or of Ambi∣tion and Pride, or of Confidence in their Riches; but 2. when their Gains by Trade should be devo∣ted to <HI>God's Honour</HI> and employ'd in <HI>his Service,</HI> in Works of <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Charity;</HI> for the Establishment and Support of the <HI>House and Worship</HI> of God, and for the Relief of <HI>his Poor:</HI> for sufficient and durable <HI>Food</HI> and <HI>Clothing</HI> for the <HI>Pastors</HI> and the <HI>Poor</HI> of Christ's Flocks.</P>
<P>But, <HI>was there ever</HI> such a Time as this, for <HI>New Tyre?</HI> and <HI>when</HI> was it? — I answer, There were such Times; and <HI>two Periods</HI> may probably be re∣ferr'd to;</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The Time of <HI>Judah's Return out of Babylon,</HI> when tho' the <HI>seventy</HI> Years of <HI>Tyre</HI> were not quite expired, yet <HI>new Tyre</HI> had attained more than <HI>fifty</HI> Years Growth, and was able to furnish the <HI>Jews</HI> toward and assist them in their <HI>rebuilding of the City</HI> and their <HI>second Temple.</HI> The <HI>Tyrians</HI> actually did this, partly <HI>in Obedience to the Edict of Cyrus,</HI> to whom they were subject, and partly from Interest
<PB N="8" REF="004002_0020_10037EEF84BCF3A0"/>and Inclination, having been Fellow-Sufferers with and in the Captivity of <HI>Judah</HI> Accordingly we read in <HI>the Book of Ezra,</HI> of <HI>Meat and Drink, and Oil given to them of Zidon and of Tyre, to bring Cedar-Trees from Lebanon to the Sea of Joppa; according to the Grant by the Hand of Cyrus King of Persia.</HI> Chap iii. 7. So early was the Merchandise of <HI>new Tyre</HI> Holiness to the Lord, for the rebuilding of his <HI>Temple,</HI> and for the furnishing of his <HI>Priests and Worshipers.</HI> And it is greatly to be observed to the Honour of the <HI>Tyrians,</HI> That as the <HI>Fathers</HI> in old <HI>Tyre</HI> had a spe∣cial Hand in Materials for building the <HI>first</HI> Tem∣ple, so had their <HI>Posterity</HI> in the <HI>second.</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>secondly,</HI> The <HI>Prophecy</HI> in my <HI>Text</HI> looks to be sure to some Time <HI>long after</HI> the Return of the <HI>Jews</HI> from <HI>Babylon;</HI> even <HI>to the Days of the Messiah</HI> and the <HI>Conversion</HI> of some in <HI>Tyre</HI> by the <HI>preached Gospel.</HI> The Prophecy plainly supposes that <HI>Tyre</HI> would for a <HI>long</HI> Term of Years return into her <HI>old</HI> Course and Way of living, and continue <HI>Pagan;</HI> tho' in a Way of <HI>Trade</HI> it might be <HI>friendly to the Jews</HI> their Nei'∣bours. In this there was little or <HI>no</HI> Religion; their <HI>Idol</HI> Gain and worldly Wealth was served in it. But in the Day of the <HI>Conversion of the Nations</HI> to the Christian Faith, <HI>Tyre</HI> also received the Gos∣pel. And then it was that her Merchandise and Hire became <HI>Holiness to the Lord,</HI> being used by a Number of Gods chosen and called there in the Services of <HI>true Religion and Godliness,</HI> the Support of his Worship, Ministers and Poor.</P>
<P>In <HI>Nehemiah</HI>'s Time we read of the <HI>Men of Tyre dwelling at Jerusalem,</HI> and we may suppose from that Time to the Day of <HI>Christ</HI> many a Gift and Offering from <HI>Tyre</HI> to the Altar of God at <HI>Jerusa∣lem;</HI> wherein the Words of <HI>David</HI> in the xlv <HI>Psalm</HI> might be fulfilled, as they doubtless were in his <HI>own</HI> Day; "<HI>The Daughter of Tyre shall be there with a Gift.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004002_0021_10037F8C98BCA058"/>
In <HI>Christ</HI>'s Time we find many of <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Zidon</HI> better disposed to have received <HI>Him</HI> and his <HI>Gospel</HI> than the Men of <HI>Israel;</HI> for if <HI>his mighty Works had been done among them they would have repented in Dust and Ashes.</HI></P>
<P>In the Days and <HI>Acts</HI> of the <HI>Apostles</HI> we find <HI>Christians</HI> at <HI>Tyre,</HI> Chap xxi. 3, 5. with whom <HI>Paul tarried seven Days,</HI> and who <HI>thro' the Spirit</HI> warn'd him of his <HI>Danger</HI> and Sufferings if he went up to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and when he departed from them <HI>they bro't him on his Way with their Wives and Children,</HI> so reverend and fervent was their <HI>Love</HI> to him for the Gospels sake, <HI>till he was out of the City,</HI> where <HI>they kneeled down on the Shore and prayed, and took Leave one of another.</HI> After this <HI>Christianity</HI> flourished in this <HI>trading City,</HI> and then her <HI>Merchandise</HI> became <HI>devoted,</HI> in part, to the Worship and Glory of <HI>Christ.</HI></P>
<P>So that we plainly find in my <HI>Text,</HI> 1. A Pro∣phecy of the <HI>Conversion of the Tyrians.</HI> 2. How they should then <HI>use their Wealth;</HI> that it would be <HI>con∣secrated to God</HI> in pious Uses, and <HI>holy</HI> to his Worship. 3. This <HI>Spirit</HI> and Example of the <HI>Tyrians</HI> is for the Learning and <HI>Imitation</HI> of other Places, Cities and Countrys, among the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> Let the Christians of <HI>Tyre</HI> teach us, that where ever the Gospel is re∣ceived, in the <HI>Love and Power</HI> of it, it will bring forth <HI>this good Fruit;</HI> the Merchandise and Hire of the People <HI>will be</HI> Holiness to the Lord. <Q>So <HI>Christians</HI> should use their Estates in the Service of God, and unto <HI>pious Uses,</HI> and count that best laid <HI>up,</HI> which is so laid <HI>out.</HI> Both the Merchan∣dise of the Men in <HI>Trade,</HI> and the Hire of the Men of <HI>Labour,</HI> should be devoted to God. The <HI>Tythe</HI> was so under the <HI>Law,</HI> and there is a <HI>Due</HI> (and surely an <HI>equal</HI> one) under the <HI>Gospel.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>New Tyre</HI> has the Honour of teaching us <HI>this</HI> un∣der the <HI>New Testament;</HI> and in all Places of the
<PB N="10" REF="004002_0022_10035EB1EEA6A850" MS="y"/>World, thro' all Ages, the <HI>Gospel</HI> is to be thus ho∣noured. As it is written, Zech. xiv. 20. <HI>In that Day there shall be upon the Bells of the Horses Holiness unto the Lord; yea every Pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be Holiness to the Lord of Hosts.</HI></P>
<P>And here let me <HI>pause</HI> and observe to you, <HI>The Advantage that trading Places have beyond others by their Merchandise and Commerce;</HI> and the <HI>Obligation</HI> they are under to <HI>improve</HI> their Advantages, <HI>for getting and propagating the saving Knowledge and Worship of God.</HI> This was <HI>Tyre's</HI> Happiness and Benefit by her Situation for <HI>Traffic.</HI> She was much the more known to <HI>Israel,</HI> and knew so much the more of <HI>her God and Worship,</HI> than other Places. Her <HI>Merchandise</HI> put her in the Way hereof. Many a Man of <HI>Tyre</HI> went a trading to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and heard of the <HI>true God,</HI> his Law to and his Works for <HI>Israel,</HI> and saw his <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> the Order and Worship of his House.</P>
<P>Many of the <HI>Jews</HI> also were led to <HI>Tyre</HI> by their Trade, where they accidentally spake of the <HI>Lord God</HI> of their Fathers, his Worship, Laws and Works. Other Places it may be took up strange and odd Notions of that <HI>separate People,</HI> as a singular sort of Folk; but the <HI>Tyrians</HI> saw they were <HI>a wise and un∣derstanding People,</HI> had <HI>Statutes and Judgments most righteous,</HI> and excelled other Places in Sobriety and Justice as well as in Devotion. And who knows what Influence this might have on that Degree of <HI>Union,</HI> which there was between <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Tyre</HI> in the Days of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon?</HI> 1 Kings v. 6. <HI>My Servants shall be with thy Servants.</HI></P>
<P>But this we know, That <HI>Christianity</HI> has been greatly serv'd by Trade and <HI>Merchandise,</HI> by means whereof a great Part of the World has been <HI>gospelised.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="004002_0023_10037F988BE10BD0"/>For the Knowledge of Christ has been <HI>propagated</HI> by Trade far and near. The <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Sea</HI> have thus help'd the <HI>Church,</HI> and as <HI>Daniel</HI> foretold it would be, <HI>Many have run to and fro'</HI> (cross the Ocean) <HI>and Knowledge has been increased.</HI> God has us'd the <HI>Loadstone</HI> and the <HI>Mariners Art</HI> in the Service of Christ, and <HI>the Ends of the Earth have seen his Salva∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>And to add yet one more Benefit of <HI>Commerce;</HI> it <HI>enlarges</HI> Peoples Hearts to do <HI>generous</HI> Things, for the Support of Divine Worship and Relief of the Poor. We always see most of this in Places of Trade. And so it has been from the first Days of <HI>Tyre,</HI> of whom we read, "<HI>The Daughter of Tyre shall be there with a Gift:</HI> She <HI>first</HI> and more <HI>free</HI> of her Gifts than others. This is most natural to Places of <HI>Commerce;</HI> Something to give and a Heart to give. May it be always found so in <HI>trading</HI> Places! but especially we wish them a Heart to make the <HI>best</HI> Gift, <HI>Themselves</HI> with their Estates, and this in the best <HI>Manner;</HI> as the Churches of <HI>Macedonia</HI> are celebrated for ever for doing, 2 Cor. viii. 1,—5. <HI>The Riches of whose Liberality abounded in their deep Poverty,</HI> praying the Apostles <HI>with much Entreaty that they would accept the Gift, and take upon them the Fellow∣ship of ministring to the Saints; first giving their own Selves to the Lord, and then to</HI> the Apostles <HI>by the Will of God.</HI> "When Converts <HI>joyn themselves to the Church</HI> then they come <HI>with a Gift,</HI> devoting their <HI>Seed and Substance</HI> together with their Persons, Gifts and Powers, to his Service and Glory.</P>
<P>It is high Time I now come to the <HI>Doctrine</HI> which my <HI>Text</HI> leads me to enlarge on, which is,</P>
<P>"<HI>That the Merchandise and Hire of a People, their Trade and worldly Business, their Gains and Riches, should be Holiness to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="004002_0024_10037F9B5BE32130"/>
The <HI>Enquiries</HI> under this <HI>Doctrine</HI> must be 1. Into the <HI>Meaning</HI> of the Phrase, <HI>Holiness to the Lord.</HI> 2. When the <HI>Traffic and Wealth</HI> of a People may be so called? 3. <HI>Why</HI> it must be so?</P>
<P N="1">I. The Meaning of this <HI>Phrase, Holiness to the Lord</HI> must be look'd into. And the <HI>first</HI> time that we find it us'd, than <HI>which</HI> there could not have been found any more <HI>eminent,</HI> was the <HI>Divine Order</HI> concern∣ing the <HI>High Priests Vestments,</HI> his <HI>Garments for Glory and Beauty,</HI> wherein <HI>he</HI> was to approach before the <HI>Lord,</HI> and minister unto Him upon the <HI>most solemn Occasions:</HI> Exodus xxviii. 36, 37, 38. <HI>Thou shalt make a Plate of pure Gold, and grave upon it like the Ingravings of a Signet, Holiness to the Lord: And thou shalt put it on a blue Lace, that it may be upon the Mitre, upon the Fore-front thereof; upon Aaron's Forehead, that he may bear the Iniquity of the Holy Things which the Children of Israel shall hallow in all their Holy Gifts; And it shall be always upon his Forehead, that they may be accepted be∣fore the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>Now we may observe in this first Appointment of this <HI>Title</HI> &amp; <HI>Inscription,</HI> that it plainly was meant to signify, 1. The infinite Holiness of the <HI>God of Israel,</HI> and of <HI>Christ</HI> the <HI>great High Priest of our Pro∣fession.</HI> 2. The Holiness of the <HI>Priesthood and Ministerial Office,</HI> their special <HI>Consecration</HI> to holy Ministrati∣ons, and their special <HI>Obligations</HI> to be <HI>Holy</HI> to the Lord. 3. The <HI>Holiness of God's Worship,</HI> and that all his People must take Care to be very <HI>holy</HI> in all their Approaches to Him, in all the <HI>Institutions</HI> of his Worship. Psalm xcix. <HI>The Lord is great in Zion, and high above all People: Let them praise thy great and ter∣rible Name, for it is Holy; Exalt the Lord our God, and worship at his holy Hill; for the Lord our God is Holy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="004002_0025_10035EBC28057FA8"/>
So that in this <HI>Title Holiness to the Lord</HI> we have 1. the Holiness of <HI>God:</HI> 2. a <HI>Consecration</HI> to Him, or the Separation of a Person or Thing to <HI>holy Uses:</HI> 3. <HI>Actual Use</HI> and Imployment therein: and 4. in a special <HI>Relation</HI> to his <HI>Worship.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI> supposes, and in the highest manner declares, as <HI>in shining Capitals of Gold,</HI> the infinite, unutterable, incomparable, inconceivable <HI>Holiness of Jehovah, the only true God;</HI> that He is the <HI>Holy One,</HI> and <HI>alone</HI> Holy, <HI>glorious</HI> in Holiness, the <HI>thrice</HI> Holy; and there is <HI>none</HI> Holy like Him or be∣side Him. This is his <HI>Glory</HI> in both <HI>Testaments</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah vi. 1, 2, 3. Revel. iv. 8, 9.</NOTE>, in his <HI>Temple</HI> above and in that below: "<HI>I saw the Lord sitting upon a Throne, high and lifted up, and his Train filled the Temple: Above it stood the Seraphims, covering their Faces, and One cried unto Another and said, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hosts! the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</HI> And if the blessed <HI>God</HI> were not Himself thus <HI>Holy,</HI> why and how should Persons and Things be called <HI>Holiness</HI> unto <HI>Him.</HI></P>
<P N="1">2. It speaks a <HI>Consecration</HI> of Persons and Things to God, a <HI>separation</HI> of them to his more immediate Service and Glory, to be of holy <HI>Use</HI> according to his Will. So <HI>Aaron</HI> and the <HI>Priesthood</HI> were of old separated and devoted to God, and therefore had <HI>this Name</HI> written on them, <HI>Holiness to the Lord.</HI> So the <HI>Sabbath</HI> is consecrated Time, and in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> called <HI>Holiness to the Lord,</HI> Exod. xxxi. 15. In like manner the very <HI>Fruit of the Trees in the fourth Year were holy to praise the Lord withal:</HI> Levit. xix. 24. The Hebrew Word is <HI>Holiness;</HI> being given to the <HI>Priests</HI> and to the <HI>Poor.</HI> And the same is said of the <HI>Vessels</HI> of Silver and Gold, Brass and Iron, in <HI>Jerioo.</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="004002_0026_10037FA82475C550"/>Josh. vi. 19. Thus <HI>Israel was Holiness to the Lord</HI> (Jer. ii. 3) by the Covenant of <HI>Circumcision,</HI> their Dedication to God therein; and in like Manner do all <HI>Christian People</HI> by their <HI>Baptismal Dedication</HI> to God wear the same Words, as on their <HI>Foreheads.</HI></P>
<P N="3">But moreover, 3. <HI>Holiness to God</HI> imports the <HI>actual Use and Improvement</HI> of Persons and Things in the <HI>Service</HI> of God and to his <HI>Glory.</HI> When <HI>Aaron</HI> put on his <HI>Mitre</HI> it was actually to <HI>officiate</HI> before the Lord. He was then in a more special manner to intend, design and act for, the sanctifying God's Name in holy Ministrations. <HI>De facto</HI> there was <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI> in his right Dispositions, and Discharge of his Office: Else the Priesthood and Worshippers <HI>profaned the Holiness of the Lord which be loved.</HI> Mal. ii. 11. Otherwise, <HI>in their set Office</HI> ("in the Discharge of their Office to which they were <HI>set apart"</HI>) <HI>they sanctified themselves in Holiness.</HI> 2 Chron. xxxi. 18. Then, and <HI>then</HI> only, were they <HI>Holiness</HI> to the Lord, in <HI>Deed</HI> and in <HI>Truth.</HI> And so are we to <HI>Christ,</HI> if we are holy in Heart and Life; if we <HI>live to Him in all holy Conversation,</HI> as in our <HI>Baptism</HI> we have bound our Selves.</P>
<P N="4">4. And lastly, This <HI>Motto, Holiness to the Lord,</HI> has a more particular Regard to the <HI>Worship</HI> of God, his <HI>Ministry</HI> and <HI>Sanctuary,</HI> his <HI>Ordinances</HI> and <HI>Insti∣tutions.</HI> So <HI>Israel</HI> as Worshippers, and <HI>Aaron</HI> as a Priest, and the <HI>Sabbath</HI> as the Day of weekly Wor∣ship, and the <HI>First-fruits</HI> as offered in Worship, were dignified with this <HI>Style</HI> of Holy to the Lord. So when <HI>we</HI> by the Grace of God devote, use and im∣ploy <HI>our</HI> Souls and Bodies, our Gifts and Powers, our Time and Estate, in the Services of Religion, and for promoting his Worship, they become <HI>Holi∣ness to the Lord.</HI> We become in our <HI>Persons</HI> as
<PB N="15" REF="004002_0027_10037FAE8B7BDD78"/><HI>Temples of the living God,</HI> and God is <HI>sanctified in us</HI> as in them <HI>that draw nigh to Him;</HI> and our <HI>Powers</HI> of Mind and Body, with the <HI>Fruit</HI> of our Bodies, our <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Estate,</HI> our <HI>Interest</HI> in the World and our <HI>Influence</HI> among Men, are as so many <HI>Offerings</HI> to God at his <HI>Altar,</HI> which <HI>consecrates</HI> the Gifts.</P>
<P>Having thus enquired into the <HI>Meaning</HI> of the Phrase <HI>Holiness to the Lord,</HI> I come new to enquire,</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>When</HI> the <HI>Traffic and Wealth, Merchandise and Business</HI> of a Person or People may be so called? To which I answer in <HI>three</HI> general Heads,</P>
<P N="1">1. When Men seriously devote, dedicate &amp; con∣secrate, first <HI>Themselves</HI> and then of their <HI>worldly Substance,</HI> a due Part, to the Glory and Service of God. 2. When what is so consecrated to God out of our Estates is <HI>actually used and imployed</HI> in his Ser∣vice, according to his Will, <HI>in Acts of Piety and Cha∣rity.</HI> 3. Always provided that what we so devote and use is <HI>acquired honestly &amp; righteously</HI> in God's Fear and Way, and is <HI>given</HI> by us with a <HI>spiritual Mind and Heart.</HI></P>
<P>I Then is our <HI>Merchandise and Trade,</HI> Wealth and worldly Business, <HI>Holiness to the Lord,</HI> when we se∣riously <HI>devote, dedicate and consecrate,</HI> a due Part of our <HI>Substance,</HI> together with <HI>our Selves,</HI> to the <HI>Glory and Service of God.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I must say <HI>our Selves,</HI> for the <HI>Person</HI> must be sacred and dedicated to God before his <HI>Estate</HI> will be so; the <HI>Person</HI> is first <HI>holy</HI> and then his <HI>Gift.</HI> This is the Order of <HI>Nature</HI> and of <HI>Grace</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. viii. 5. Matth. xxiii. 17.</NOTE>; for which
<PB N="16" REF="004002_0028_10037FB056E63A78"/>is <HI>greater,</HI> the Gift or the Giver! how much <HI>less</HI> is a Mans Estate before God, than the <HI>Man</HI> himself? according to the <HI>Apostles</HI> just Estimation of the <HI>Ma∣cedonians</HI> and their <HI>ministring to the Saints, 'Who first gave their own Selves to the Lord.</HI> God looks to a Mans <HI>Heart</HI> and Soul in all his Offerings to Him, whether of <HI>Praise</HI> or <HI>Alms.</HI> It is the <HI>Person</HI> who wears upon his Forehead the Inscription, <HI>Holiness to the Lord.</HI> If the Person be unholy before Him, <HI>his Sacrifice is an Abomination.</HI> He profanes and pol∣lutes his own Gift; as <HI>Cain</HI> did his Offering, bring∣ing it with a wicked Mind. If we have not given our <HI>Selves,</HI> our <HI>Hearts</HI> to God, we may give <HI>all our Goods</HI> to feed the Poor, or give it to the <HI>Church, (for Them that dwell before the Lord)</HI> and yet there will be nothing of <HI>Holiness</HI> in the one or in the other<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiii. 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Yet the <HI>Estate</HI> must go with the Person, as it is in <HI>Marriage;</HI> and it has pleased God to <HI>espouse</HI> un∣to Himself the Soul that gives it self to him;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Jerem. iii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>I am married to you, saith the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>first Offering</HI> from Man that we read of, ac∣ceptable to God, was the <HI>Person</HI> with a part of his <HI>Estate;</HI> I mean <HI>Abel</HI>'s Offering. <HI>Cain</HI> also bro't of the Fruit of the Ground, but God had <HI>no Respect</HI> to his Offering because he <HI>had not first</HI> given <HI>himself</HI> to Him. <HI>Abraham</HI> having resigned up Himself to the Divine Will and Call, gave his <HI>Tythe of all unto the Priest of the most High God;</HI> the famous <HI>Type</HI> of his <HI>Lord and Saviour,</HI> after whose <HI>Order</HI> Christ is <HI>a Priest for ever;</HI> and he was <HI>blessed</HI> by him. So <HI>Jacob</HI> vowed, first <HI>that the Lord should be his God,</HI> and then a <HI>Tenth</HI> of all that God should give him. So <HI>David</HI> having first render'd his <HI>Heart</HI> to God in Flames of
<PB N="17" REF="004002_0029_10037FB7E62E6230"/>Devotion, then gathered <HI>vast Stores</HI> which he con∣secrated for <HI>a Temple</HI> to the Name of the Lord; and his <HI>Princes</HI> followed his Royal Example, 1 Chron. xxix. 16.17. "<HI>O Lord our God, all this Store that we have prepared cometh of thine Hand, and it is all thine own: I know also my God, that Thou triest the Heart and hast Pleasure in Uprightness: As for me in the Up∣rightness of my Heart have I willingly offer'd all these Things, &amp;c.</HI> Here was the Offering <HI>of the Man af∣ter God's own Heart.</HI> And we find in the Gospel when the <HI>young Man</HI> came and offered <HI>Himself</HI> to Christ, our Lord demanded of him also the Use of all his <HI>Estate,</HI> and he <HI>went away sorrowful.</HI> It is added, <HI>for he had great Possessions</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xix. 22.</NOTE>: He might then, one would think, have been the more ready to have given <HI>freely</HI> to the poor out of it: Or, did he think his <HI>Riches</HI> of more Price than <HI>himself?</HI> poor <HI>Soul!</HI> it seems as if he would not have offer'd himself to Christ, had he tho't himself half so good as his Pos∣sessions! his going away <HI>sorrowful</HI> shew'd that he was not <HI>sincere</HI> in the Offer of Himself. On the contrary <HI>Zacchcus</HI> being a sincere Penitent, gave <HI>half his Goods to the poor,</HI> and Christ accepted of his <HI>Per∣son,</HI> and said to him, "<HI>Salvation is come to thy House</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Luke xix. 9.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>So the <HI>first Christians</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Acts iv. 34, 35. v. 1, 2.</NOTE> when they had given up <HI>Themselves</HI> to Christ in <HI>Baptism,</HI> gave in all their <HI>Goods</HI> into a common Stock. It was on an extraor∣dinary <HI>Occasion,</HI> and under an extraordinary Effusion of the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> The Churches Needs call'd for it, and <HI>the Spirit of God</HI> directed to it. <HI>Ananias</HI> and his <HI>Wife</HI> had only given their <HI>Names,</HI> not their Hearts; and keeping <HI>back</HI> part of the Price <HI>died</HI> for the Sacri∣lege,
<PB N="18" REF="004002_0030_10037FBEE8BC8B08"/>and their <HI>Lying to the Holy Ghost.</HI> On the con∣trary, the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> whose Praise is in all the Churches for Evermore, having given both their <HI>Names and Hearts</HI> to Christ, gave liberally of their <HI>Estates</HI> for the Relief of the <HI>poor Saints,</HI> even <HI>beyond their Ability.</HI> Thus was their <HI>Merchandise</HI> Holiness to the Lord. Neither will the Estate do without the <HI>Person,</HI> all his Heart and all his Soul; nor the Person do (if that could be) without the <HI>Estate,</HI> for it will go with the Heart and Love. — But I prevent my self on the <HI>second</HI> Answer to the En∣quiry I am upon:</P>
<P N="2">II. Our Merchandise and Wealth is <HI>Holiness to the Lord,</HI> when what is consecrated and devoted out of our <HI>Estate,</HI> is actually <HI>used</HI> and imployed in the <HI>Ser∣vice</HI> of God, according to his <HI>Will. "When thou vowest a Vow, defer not to pay; why should God be an∣gry at thy Voice<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. v. 4, 5, 6. Psalm lxxvi. 11,</NOTE>? Vow and pay to the Lord thy God! let all that be round about Him bring Presents unto Him that ought to be feared.</HI> Present <HI>thy Self,</HI> and then remember that thou hast implicitly and virtually, if not most explicitly and expresly, vowed to him <HI>his Dues out of thy Estate.</HI> Bring these <HI>Presents</HI> to Him as long as thou livest, in their returning Sea∣sons, <HI>Better it is that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.</HI></P>
<P>It is to be feared that many <HI>Christians</HI> do not eno' apprehend and consider, that their <HI>worldly Estate</HI> enters into their <HI>general Vow,</HI> and is always a Part of it, in their <HI>Self-Dedication</HI> to God. But God's Part is <HI>holy to Him</HI> whether we consider it or no; and if we render Him his Part, the <HI>whole</HI> is sancti∣fied unto us. There is not <HI>Holiness to God</HI> written
<PB N="19" REF="004002_0031_10037FC4FA63E040"/>on our Persons, Faculties and Powers, nor on our Estate, till both one and the other are <HI>used</HI> to holy Ends and Purposes, in actual Ministrations to the Glory of God. But if we are actually honou∣ring God with our whole Man, Soul and Body, the Powers of the one, and the Endowments of the other, the <HI>Spirit of the Living God</HI> dwells and rules in us, and has <HI>graven on us,</HI> as in Letters of Gold, <HI>Holiness</HI> to Himself. And if we are <HI>honouring the Lord with our Substance, and with the First-fruits of our Increase,</HI> we may <HI>read</HI> with Pleasure the same <HI>Inscrip∣tion</HI> on our <HI>Estates,</HI> &amp; others may <HI>see</HI> it on us. 2 Cor. iii. 2. <HI>Ye are our Epistle written in our Hearts, known and read of all Men: Ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistle of Christ, ministred by us, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God; not in Tables of Stone, but in fleshly Tables of the Heart.</HI></P>
<P>Now if it be ask'd, <HI>Wherein</HI> a Part of our worldly Estate is to be <HI>us'd</HI> to the Glory of God? it is easily answer'd in the <HI>two</HI> general and known <HI>Instances,</HI> Works of <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Charity.</HI> The <HI>first</HI> is the very <HI>Thing</HI> in my Text, and the <HI>other is like unto it,</HI> and never to be separated; the <HI>first</HI> is a more direct Ex∣pression of Love to <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>other</HI> to our <HI>Neibour;</HI> on which <HI>two hang all the Law and the Prophets,</HI> and consequently the whole of <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI> is contained in them.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then, Our <HI>Wealth</HI> and worldly Business is <HI>Holiness</HI> to the Lord, when with a true and right Heart it is used and imployed in <HI>Works of Piety to∣ward God, for the Support of his Worship.</HI> When it is <HI>for them that dwell before the Lord to eat sufficiently, and for durable Clothing.</HI> That is to say, When Men make Conscience of giving unto God a due Pro∣portion out of their Estates for the Support of <HI>Re∣ligion</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="004002_0032_10037FCC5537D6C8"/>and the Maintenance of God's <HI>Ministers,</HI> to feed and clothe them, and that sufficiently and <HI>ho∣nourably;</HI> eno' to eat of plentifully, and to clothe their Families decently, and leave something to them when they die. — The <HI>Tithes</HI> of old were such a Provision for the <HI>Levites.</HI> And as they that served at the <HI>Altar</HI> liv'd of it, so has the Lord ordained <HI>that they who preach the Gospel should live of the Gospel,</HI> 1 Cor. ix. 14. The Bread of <HI>Ministers</HI> is the Bread of <HI>God,</HI> and we must allow Him to be a good <HI>Housholder,</HI> &amp; to keep a good <HI>Table.</HI> He does not feed his Houshold by <HI>Miracles,</HI> but by his reser∣ved <HI>Dues</HI> out of the Estates of his People. He will have it done by <HI>their</HI> Hands, that they may do Him Duty and <HI>Homage,</HI> and pay him <HI>Tribute.</HI> There is always a part of your <HI>Moneys,</HI> whereof he says to you, "<HI>Whose Image and Superscription is this?</HI> and you must answer, <HI>It is Gods.</HI> Then <HI>render to God the Things that are his.</HI> Matth. xxii. 21. Do it by mi∣nistring out of your <HI>Estates</HI> to his House and Wor∣ship, according to the <HI>Ability</HI> which he gives you.</P>
<P>When People expend prudently and piously for the setting up, and carrying on, the <HI>Worship</HI> of God where they live, or in other Places; or in sending the Gospel to People destitute thereof, and perish∣ing for lack of Knowledge; and in making Provi∣sion for a more private Instruction of Children in such Places; their Wealth in this <HI>Use</HI> of it becomes <HI>Holiness to the Lord.</HI> It comes into a <HI>Relation</HI> to di∣vine Worship, even as <HI>Aaron</HI> and the <HI>Holy Things</HI> of old belonging to the <HI>Tabernacle.</HI>—But unto such Works of <HI>Piety</HI> for the Support of God's <HI>Worship,</HI> we must add</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Works of <HI>Charity and Mercy,</HI> which are as much in themselves, and render us as much, <HI>Ho∣liness
<PB N="21" REF="004002_0033_10035ECC429E9FB0"/>to the Lord,</HI> as the other. These belong to the <HI>second Table of the Law,</HI> as those to the <HI>first.</HI> Pity to the poor and needy, in Obedience to God &amp; Con∣formity to Him, is Piety and <HI>Sanctity</HI> in his Sight. They are the Lords <HI>Receivers</HI> as well as his Priests, and we have them <HI>always with us.</HI> And the <HI>pious poor</HI> are among his <HI>spiritual Priests,</HI> rich in Faith, chosen of God and <HI>called.</HI> He that gives to them, for their comfortable Eating and Clothing, with a right and charitable Frame of Spirit, <HI>lends to the Lord, and honours Him with his Substance.</HI> These are spiritual <HI>Sacrifices</HI> with which God is <HI>well pleased.</HI> There is Worship and <HI>Incense,</HI> an <HI>Odour of a sweet Smell</HI> in them, as well as in Offerings at the <HI>Altar</HI> of God. The <HI>Alms</HI> of Believers go up for <HI>a Memo∣rial</HI> before God, with their <HI>Prayers;</HI> as did those of <HI>Cornelius.</HI> The <HI>Great High Priest,</HI> at the <HI>Golden Altar</HI> within the <HI>Vail,</HI> presents the one and the other in the <HI>Cloud of Incense,</HI> his own Merits &amp; Intercession. <HI>He,</HI> the <HI>Holy One</HI> of God, was <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI> above all the Sons of Men; and his Miracles of <HI>Mercy</HI> were like his Prayers and Devotions beyond number, and alike honorary to God. God will have <HI>his poor</HI> fed, as well as his <HI>Ministers.</HI> And why not? are they not together <HI>Heirs of his Kingdom?</HI> and has he not put them together again and again, the <HI>Levite</HI> and the <HI>Poor</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xvi. 11, 14. xxvi. 11.13.</NOTE>, in his Peoples rejoicing before him on his <HI>solemn Feasts?</HI></P>
<P>But give me leave more <HI>particularly</HI> to prove, by three or four <HI>Arguments,</HI> that Works of <HI>Charity to the poor</HI> are proper <HI>Holiness to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. They are <HI>Obedience to the Law of God</HI> which is most holy. The <HI>Word</HI> of God is the Rule of Holi∣ness,
<PB N="22" REF="004002_0034_10035F4AE09F22A0"/>and one of its grand Rules and Laws to us is <HI>Alms-deeds,</HI> and acts of Charity. These are an e∣minent Branch of that <HI>Holiness</HI> which the Lord re∣quires, Zech. vii. 9. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, Shew Mercy every one to his Brother.</HI> Only let what we do be done in Obedience to God, for his Glory, and with a pure Respect to his Will, not <HI>to be seen of Men;</HI> ha∣ving true <HI>Compassion one of another, loving as Brethren, pitiful, courteous, tender-hearted</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Matth. vi. 1. 1 Pet. iii. 8. Ephes. iv. 32.</NOTE>; otherwise there is no <HI>Holiness</HI> to the Lord, nor <HI>Reward</HI> from our <HI>Fa∣ther that is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. To give to the <HI>poor</HI> out of our Estates is <HI>Holi∣ness to the Lord,</HI> because it is <HI>our Conformity to God and Christ in their Bounties and Mercies to the indigent and miserable.</HI> Conformity to the Holy God is <HI>Holiness,</HI> but <HI>Compassion</HI> and Mercy to the poor is Confor∣mity to God; <HI>who maketh his Sun to rise and his Rain to fall on the evil and on the good; Be ye therefore per∣fect as your Father in Heaven is perfect.</HI> Mat. v. 45, 48. So <HI>Christ</HI> approved Himself to be the <HI>Holy One</HI> in the Days of his Flesh, by filling up his Life with Acts of <HI>God-like Charity and Mercy.</HI> They <HI>cried after Him,</HI> laid themselves in his Way, <HI>and he healed them all.</HI> This was <HI>Holiness to his Father,</HI> and in the Sight of Men, and we should lay up in our Hearts his me∣morable Words, Acts xx. 35. <HI>It is more blessed to give than to receive.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. A right and charitable Disposition is <HI>the Fruit of the Holy Spirit</HI> in us, &amp; therefore can be no other than <HI>Holiness to the Lord. "The Fruit of the Spirit is Love</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 22. Phil. ii. 1. Col. iii. 12.</NOTE>. There is much of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God in Bowels of Pity to one another. "<HI>If there be any
<PB N="23" REF="004002_0035_10035ED381569338"/>Fellowship of the Spirit, if any Bowels and Mercies.</HI> The Communion of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and the Communion of <HI>Saints,</HI> is experienced &amp; exhibited in these <HI>Bowels,</HI> which we are therefore exhorted to put on, as the <HI>Elect of God, holy and beloved;</HI> and because this Cha∣rity is <HI>the Bond of Perfectness.</HI> See the Argument and <HI>Demonstration</HI> of the Apostle <HI>James</HI> on this Head, Jam. ii. 15, 16. <HI>If a Brother or Sister be naked, and destitute of daily Food; and one of you say unto them, Depart in Peace, be you warmed &amp; filled: notwithstand∣ing ye give them not those Things which are needful to the Body; what doth it profit?</HI> q. d. What Fruit, what <HI>Evidence</HI> of any true <HI>Holiness</HI> is there, in a <HI>Soul</HI> or <HI>Life</HI> destitute of the Fruits of <HI>Charity.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Is the <HI>Sabbath and its Worship</HI> Holiness to the Lord? So are <HI>Charities and Mercies.</HI> There is such a <HI>Sanctity</HI> in these, that they belong to &amp; are a Part of the <HI>Sanctification of the Sabbath.</HI> Yea such Regard is had by God to an Act of Mercy to our poor Nei'bour, that He has made his own Worship to <HI>vail</HI> and give place thereto for the Time<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. xii. 7. Luke xiv. 5.</NOTE>. "<HI>Go ye and learn this, I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice. Which of you having an Ox or Ass fallen into a Pit, will not straightway pull him out on the Sabbath day?</HI> And if a good and devout Man must show this Mercy to his <HI>Brute-Creature</HI> on the <HI>Sabbath day,</HI> the <HI>Holiness</HI> of God directing him so to do; how much more must not Acts of Compassion and Mercy to our poor and needy <HI>Brethren,</HI> and to the necessitous <HI>Members</HI> of Jesus Christ, be esteemed by <HI>the Lord of the Sabbath</HI> to be <HI>Holiness</HI> to himself? The <HI>Zeal</HI> for God's House and Day <HI>eat up</HI> our Holy <HI>Saviour,</HI> but <HI>more</HI> his Zeal for an Act of <HI>Mercy</HI> to a poor Woman; Luke xiii. 10,—17. <HI>He was teaching in one of the Synagogues on
<PB N="24" REF="004002_0036_10037FCDD87A1148"/>the Sabbath-day, and behold there was a Woman which had a Spirit of Infirmity eighteen Years, and was bowed together, and could in no wise lift up her Self: And when Jesus saw her, be called her to him and said to her, Wo∣man thou art loosed of thine Infirmity! And he laid his Hands on her, and immediately she was made straight, and glorified God.</HI> Tell me now which was most <HI>Holi∣ness to the Lord,</HI> the <HI>Sermon</HI> of Christ on that blessed Sabbath, or this his Act of <HI>Healing</HI> the poor Wo∣man? truly <HI>both</HI> alike.</P>
<P>Moreover, <HI>Offerings</HI> out of our Estates, and <HI>Col∣lections</HI> for the poor, do both belong to the <HI>Temple</HI> of God and to his <HI>Sabbaths.</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> tells us of a <HI>Treasury</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Luke xxi. 1, 2, 3.</NOTE> of God in the <HI>Temple</HI> of old, and that on a Time as <HI>Christ</HI> was looking on the <HI>rich Men</HI> that cast their <HI>Gifts</HI> into the Treasury, he saw also a cer∣tain <HI>poor Widow</HI> who threw in <HI>two Mites,</HI> and said, "<HI>Of a Truth She has cast in more than they all.</HI> So from Heaven the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> still looks with Approbation and Pleasure, on the <HI>free-will-Offerings</HI> of his Wor∣shipers in his House of Prayer, on <HI>Lord's Days</HI> and at other appointed Times; the <HI>poorer</HI> as well as the <HI>richer.</HI> — And so near <HI>a Kin</HI> are God's <HI>Worship</HI> and <HI>Contributions</HI> for the poor, that they are joyned by the <HI>Lord</HI> in <HI>Affinity,</HI> and equally declared to be <HI>Ho∣liness to Him,</HI> in that <HI>Apostolical Constitution</HI> and Di∣rection<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xvi. 1, 2,</NOTE>, "<HI>Now concerning Collections for the Saints, as I have given Order to the Churches of Galatia, so do ye; Upon the first Day of the Week let every one of you lay by him in Store, as God hath prosper'd him,</HI> &amp;c. Your <HI>Prayers</HI> and <HI>Hearing</HI> the Word this <HI>Evening</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">At a <HI>quarter Meeting for Charity, the Lord's day Evening,</HI> March 6. 1726.</NOTE> are not more <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI> than your <HI>Collection</HI> is. The
<PB N="25" REF="004002_0037_10037FD2F29E63A8"/>same God has said to us, "<HI>Remember the Sabbath-day to keep it holy,</HI> and hath also said, '<HI>to do Good and to communicate forget not, for with such Sacrifices God is well pleased.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. And lastly, The <HI>Promises</HI> made by God to those that are merciful and bountiful to the poor, do a∣bundantly declare that there is <HI>Holiness to the Lord</HI> in true Acts of religious Charity and Mercy. <HI>He that is Holy</HI> would not be so well pleased with our <HI>Charities</HI> to the poor and needy, if there were not much <HI>Holiness</HI> in them. He has therefore <HI>blessed</HI> the merciful, and said that they <HI>shall find Merey.</HI> He is <HI>not unrighteous to forget this Work and Labour of Love.</HI> Not that there is any <HI>Merit</HI> or Desert herein, but there is of his own <HI>Holiness</HI> in it. If it were not so, <HI>Alms</HI> would never come up for a <HI>Memorial</HI> before Him. Nor would they be so remembred, mention'd and rewarded in the Day of <HI>Judgment,</HI> as Christ has told us they will be; "<HI>Then shall the King say to them on his right Hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the Foundation of the World; for I was hungry and ye gave me Meat, thirsty and ye gave me Drink, a Stranger and ye took me its, naked and ye clothed me,</HI> &amp;c. These high and ever∣lasting <HI>Rewards</HI> of the <HI>Charities</HI> of Saints, prove them to be <HI>Holiness to the Lord. Blessed and Holy is he that has Part</HI> in these Promises<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 7. Heb. vi. 10. Acts x. 4. Matth. xxv. 35. Rev. xx. 6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>And thus we have seen that the <HI>actual Use</HI> &amp; <HI>Im∣provement</HI> of our Estates in the Service of God, in Works of <HI>Piety and Charity,</HI> renders them Holiness to the Lord. — But there must be something added by way of <HI>Caution</HI> and Limitation, and that is</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="26" REF="004002_0038_10037FD4770C7FB0"/>
III. Always provided that what we so devote and use <HI>is acouired honestly and righteously</HI> in the <HI>Fear</HI> of God and in his <HI>Way;</HI> and is <HI>given</HI> by us <HI>with a spi∣ritual Mind, Heart and Affection.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. What we <HI>have</HI> and <HI>give</HI> must be <HI>gotten</HI> in <HI>God's Way,</HI> which is the Way of <HI>Holiness.</HI> If we go out of <HI>that</HI> we <HI>sin,</HI> and whatever we get in <HI>sinful</HI> Ways is necessarily <HI>unholy</HI> before the Lord, and abominable in his Eyes. Now that what we get may be ac∣quired in God's holy Way,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Our <HI>Dependence</HI> must be on God for his <HI>Blessing</HI> to make our lawful Endeavours prosperous; For it is the Blessing of God <HI>that makes rich,</HI> and it is <HI>He</HI> that <HI>gives us Power to get Wealth;</HI> it is therefore <HI>prophane and unholy</HI> to act in our worldly Business but with a Dependance on the Governing and over∣ruling Providence of a wise and Sovereign God: James iv. 14. <HI>Go to now you that say, To Day or to Morrow we will</HI> be here or there, do this or that, and <HI>make Gain; Whereas ye ought to say, If the Lord will</HI> we shall do so. Let <HI>Jacob</HI> teach us how to begin and go thro' the World: Gen. xxviii. 20. <HI>If God will be with me in the Way I go, and give me Bread to eat and Raiment to put on.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> We must daily commit our worldly Af∣fairs to God in <HI>Prayer,</HI> and more especially at Times our more important Concerns and Interests. Our Lord has taught us to bring these before God in our Prayers: We pray for them in that <HI>Directory</HI> or <HI>Form</HI> for Prayer which he has given us, the <HI>fourth Petition</HI> in it. We pray <Q>that of God's free Gift we may receive a competent Portion of the good Things of this Life, and enjoy his Blessing with them.</Q> It is greatly for the Glory of God, and
<PB N="27" REF="004002_0039_10035ED97655FD08"/>for our temporal Interest and daily Comfort that we daily pray for God's gracious Direction to us in, and for his Blessing on our worldly Business: "<HI>That the Lord thy God may bless Thee in all the Works of thy Hand.</HI> So <HI>Isaac</HI> pray'd for his Son, "<HI>God give Thee of the Dew of Heaven, and the Fulness of the Earth, and Plenty of Corn and Wine.</HI> And so <HI>Jacob</HI> prayed for himself, "<HI>If God will be with me in the Way I go, and give me Bread to eat.</HI> And so <HI>Moses</HI> for the Tribe of <HI>Levi, "Bless, Lord, his Substance:</HI> The <HI>less</HI> it is, the more <HI>need</HI> to pray over it; for the Bles∣sing of God can make a <HI>little</HI> go far. The wise <HI>Agur</HI> has taught us <HI>what</HI> to pray for, "<HI>Feed me with Food convenient for me.</HI> He is <HI>unholy</HI> &amp; prophane whose Prayer is not to God <HI>his Heavenly Father, for these Things</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Deut. xiv. 19. Gen. xxvii. 28. xxviii. 20. Deut. xxxiii. 11. Prov. xxx. 18. Matth. vi. 32. 1 Tim. iv. 5.</NOTE>. And they are <HI>sanctified to us by Prayer,</HI> which makes them <HI>Holiness to the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> We must keep from <HI>every sinful &amp; wicked Way</HI> in our worldly Acquisitions and Enjoyments, and govern our Selves by the holy Laws of <HI>Justice and Righteousness, Sobriety and Temperance,</HI> and uni∣versal <HI>Obedience</HI> to the Divine <HI>Law.</HI> Else all is un∣holy and unclean, and we forfeit God's Blessing and provoke his Curse. It is only sincere, hearty, universal and persevering <HI>Obedience</HI> to the holy Commandments of the Lord our God, that will render us holy and acceptable in his Sight. Deut. xxviii. 1, 2, 3. <Q><HI>If thou shalt bearken diligently to the Voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and do all his Com∣mandments, all these Blessings shall come on thee, — Blessed shalt thou be in the City and blessed in the Field! blessed the Fruit of thy Body and the Fruit of thy Ground! — blessed thy Basket and thy Store! blessed shalt thou
<PB N="28" REF="004002_0040_10037FD64C97EC38"/>be when thou comest in, and blessed when thou goest out.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> In Case a Person have acquired Riches in <HI>any unjust and unrighteous Manner,</HI> by <HI>Deceit and Fraud,</HI> or by <HI>Extortion and Oppression;</HI> he must make <HI>his Peace with God by Repentance,</HI> with deep <HI>Humilia∣tion</HI> before Him for his Wickedness; and if it be in his Power he must make <HI>Restitution;</HI> which if he cannot do to the <HI>Persons wronged</HI> let him do it to the <HI>poor,</HI> beseeching God to <HI>pardon</HI> him for <HI>Christ</HI>'s sake and accept his Offering; and then his <HI>Merchandise</HI> and his <HI>Charities</HI> shall be yet <HI>Holiness to the Lord,</HI> not∣withstanding his past <HI>Unrighteousness</HI> and Sin. See the Case of <HI>Zaccheus,</HI> Luke xix. 8. <HI>And Zaccheus stood and said before the Lord,</HI> <Q><HI>Behold, Lord, the half of my Goods give I to the poor; and if I have taken any Thing from any Man by false Accusation, I restore him four-fold: And Jesus said unto him, This Day is Salvation come to this House.</HI></Q> "When true Faith, Repentance and new Obedience comes to a House, <HI>Salvation</HI> comes to it, however great the Sins of it had been before. <HI>Zaccheus</HI> had been a <HI>Publican</HI> and an Extortioner, exacting more than was his right. "Those <HI>Publicans</HI> had the Ear of the <HI>Roman Gover∣nours,</HI> and by a false Account of Persons and Things could easily be injurious. This <HI>Chief</HI> among the <HI>Publicans</HI> was also answerable (it is to be feared) for many Abuses of Power by those that were under him But he here stood a <HI>Penitent</HI> before Christ, confessing and seeking Mercy. A <HI>Change</HI> of Heart and Way, and <HI>Fruits meet for Repentance,</HI> appear in his Words. <Q>A very large Proportion of these ill-gotten Goods he set apart for Works of Piety and Charity.</Q> He could not refund to the Men in <HI>Trade</HI> and Merchandise, whom he had wrong'd <HI>in the Seat of Custom:</HI> They were gone hither and
<PB N="29" REF="004002_0041_10037FD9CC300A78"/>thither, and he knew 'em not nor was like to see some of 'em any more: to those he could find he restored <HI>four-fold,</HI> the Residue he restored to the <HI>Poor;</HI> and Christ accepted him as a humble <HI>Believer</HI> and true <HI>Penitent, a Son of Abraham.</HI> — Thus what we <HI>get</HI> must be in God's <HI>Way,</HI> the Way of <HI>Holiness.</HI> And then</P>
<P N="2">2. We must <HI>use it with a spiritual Heart and Mind.</HI> As, (to add unto <HI>much</HI> that has been already said) We must daily <HI>praise</HI> and <HI>bless</HI> God for <HI>daily Bread,</HI> for all our Receipts and <HI>Increase;</HI> we must give Him the <HI>Glory</HI> and render Him our <HI>Thanks;</HI> "<HI>O God, I am not worthy of the least of all the Mercies, and of all the Truth, which thou hast showed unto thy Servant! for with my Staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two Bands.</HI> This was <HI>Holiness to the Lord.</HI> — We must earnestly <HI>desire</HI> and seriously <HI>resolve,</HI> by the Grace and Help of God, to <HI>serve</HI> Him in Righteous∣ness and Holiness before him, and with <HI>gladness of Heart,</HI> with all the <HI>Good Things</HI> that a bountiful God shall see fit for us, that <HI>the Lord shall be our God,</HI> and we will live <HI>devoted</HI> to him, and <HI>lay out</HI> our selves to glorify him, and make it our <HI>Meat and Drink to do his Will.</HI> This will be <HI>Holiness</HI> unto Him. — The <HI>Abundance of all Things which</HI> the Lord our God may <HI>give us richly to enjoy</HI> must be so far from <HI>charming</HI> our vain Minds and <HI>chaining</HI> them down to the Things of Earth and Sense, that we must indeed make <HI>Ar∣guments</HI> and <HI>Motives</HI> of them, to <HI>raise</HI> our Hearts un∣to and <HI>fix</HI> them on the Things that are unseen, <HI>spiri∣tual and heavenly.</HI> <Q><HI>From Men of the World which have their Portion in this Life.—As for me, I will behold thy Face in Righteousness! I shall be satisfied when I awake in thy Likeness.</HI></Q>
<Q><HI>Many there be that say, Who will shew us any Good? Lord, lift Thou up the Light of thy Countenance upon us! Thou hast put
<PB N="30" REF="004002_0042_10037FDCAB7CE388"/>Gladness in my Heart more than in the Time that their Corn and their Wine increased</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm lv. 6. xvii. ult. Phil. iv. 11.</NOTE>.</Q> — Again, We must be ready, thro' Grace, to <HI>part with,</HI> and <HI>submit to the Will of God</HI> in the <HI>loss</HI> of all worldly Things; <HI>learning in whatsoever State we are therewith to be con∣tent, both how to be abased and to abound, to be full and to be hungry.</HI> Let this be our Frame and Temper in the Acquisition and Use of our worldly Estate, and God will write <HI>Holiness</HI> unto Himself on us and it.</P>
<P>Only it must be added, to the Glory of <HI>Christ,</HI> That our <HI>Persons</HI> and our <HI>Estate</HI> are <HI>Holiness</HI> to the Lord only <HI>by Faith in his Holiness and Righteousness,</HI> who is our <HI>Great High-Priest</HI> within the <HI>Holy of Holies,</HI> ever living to make <HI>Intercession</HI> for us, in <HI>whom</HI> and for whose <HI>Sake</HI> it is that repenting believing Sin∣ners are accepted as <HI>Holy</HI> in the Sight of God. <HI>Aaron</HI> within the <HI>Vail</HI> was the eminent <HI>Type</HI> of <HI>Jesus entring by his own Blood.</HI> He is <HI>of God made to us</HI> Holiness, and <HI>we the Holiness of God in Him. He,</HI> the <HI>Holy One of God</HI> was made <HI>sin for us,</HI> that we Sinners may by Faith in Him become <HI>Holiness to the Lord.</HI> With the Heart <HI>Man</HI> believeth <HI>in Him</HI> unto Righteous∣ness, and God is <HI>sanctified</HI> therein while his Mercy <HI>abounds unto the Chief of Sinners.</HI> Coming to <HI>Him,</HI> we are built up <HI>a spiritual House, a holy Priesthood.</HI> As He went to the <HI>Cross,</HI> he said, "<HI>For their Sakes I sanctify my Self, that they may be sanctified.</HI> He was <HI>separate from Sin,</HI> that we may <HI>come boldly to the Throne of Grace</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Hebrews x. 19,—22. 2 Cor. v. 21. 1 Pet. ii. 4, 5. Heb. vii. 26. Phil. iii. 9.</NOTE>. Bear <HI>this</HI> in Mind, That no <HI>Saint</HI> is Ho∣liness to the Lord from any <HI>inherent</HI> Holiness in him, nor <HI>for any Works of Righteousness done by him,</HI> but for the perfect and glorious <HI>Holiness of Christ</HI> reckon'd to him.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="004002_0043_10035EDF94309058"/>
And having thus said, <HI>When</HI> the Traffic &amp; Wealth of a People is <HI>Holiness to the Lord,</HI> I come (as was proposed) in the <HI>third</HI> and last place to enquire,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Why</HI> it must be so? Why our <HI>Merchandise and Hire</HI> should be bro't, with <HI>our Selves,</HI> under a holy <HI>Consecration</HI> to God, and <HI>Use</HI> for Him.</P>
<P>I might easily enter into, and enlarge on, many <HI>Reasons</HI> of this Duty, which are also <HI>Motives</HI> to it, and must pray you to give <HI>'em</HI> a just <HI>Consideration,</HI> and so make the <HI>Application</HI> of all that has been said every one to himself.</P>
<P N="1">1. It is the <HI>highest End</HI> &amp; <HI>best Use</HI> of Man and of <HI>all</HI> that belongs to him, his <HI>first</HI> and <HI>last</HI> End, to be <HI>Holy to God. "The Earth is the Lord's, and the Fulness there∣of, the World and they that dwell therein.</HI> The <HI>Hea∣vens,</HI> with all their <HI>bright</HI> Inhabitants, serve to no higher End.

Those <HI>Watchers</HI> and <HI>Holy Ones</HI> on High use and <HI>imploy</HI> all their Powers and <HI>Riches,</HI> in <HI>Boun∣ties</HI> to the poor and needy Children of Men, the <HI>poor Saints</HI> below. And can <HI>we</HI> do better than <HI>They</HI> to serve the Ends of <HI>Holiness,</HI> and the Glory of God? "<HI>Whether they be Thrones, or Dominions or Principalities,</HI> or whether <HI>we</HI> be higher or lower in Rank and E∣state on Earth, <HI>all are created by Him and for Him; to Whom be Glory for ever</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm xxiv. 1. Heb. i. 14. Daniel iv. 13. Col. i. 16.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2">2. This is therefore the <HI>prescribed, commanded Use</HI> of our worldly Riches, that they be <HI>holy to God.</HI> "This is <HI>the Will of God in Christ Jesus concerning</HI> us, and our
<PB N="32" REF="004002_0044_10037FDF63108448"/>Sanctification. God cannot <HI>will better</HI> concerning us, than that <HI>we</HI> and all that belongs to us be <HI>holy</HI> to Him. This is <HI>his good and acceptable,</HI> his <HI>royal and perfect Will.</HI> Let us put our <HI>Amen</HI> to it and say, "<HI>Father, thy Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">1 Thes. v. 18. iv. 3. Rom. xii. 2. Jam. ii. 8. 1 Pet. ii. 9.</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">3. It is <HI>the greatest Honour and Dignity</HI> put on us, and our worldly State, that we and that be <HI>Holiness to the Lord. "This Honour have all the Saints,</HI> and only They; <HI>praise ye the Lord.</HI> The Glory of <HI>God</HI> is his <HI>Holiness.</HI> He is the <HI>High and Lofty One,</HI> whose <HI>Name is Holy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. lvii. 15.

<P N="4">4. Our <HI>worldly Goods</HI> will be vilely <HI>abused</HI> to the <HI>Dishonour</HI> of God, and the <HI>Hurt</HI> of our Selves and o∣thers, if they be not <HI>holy</HI> to God.

<P N="5">5. The Merchandise and Hire of Persons and Places should be Holiness to the Lord, <HI>that the Lord their God may bless them in all the Works of their Hands.</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="004002_0046_10035EE2167FC7E8"/>The Way of <HI>Holiness</HI> is the Way of <HI>Blessing.</HI> God has promised to bless his People in <HI>this</HI> his required Way. It is He that gives us <HI>Power to get Wealth.</HI> Read his <HI>Promises</HI> to an Obedient holy People, Deut. xxviii. "<HI>All these Blessings shall come upon thee, —Blessed shalt thou be in the City and in the Field,</HI> &amp;c. He has <HI>threatned to curse</HI> an unholy People in the same Instances.

<P N="6">6. Our Merchandise and Hire should be holy to God, that so <HI>his spiritual Blessing may come on our Souls.</HI> This lies especially in a spiritual Mind, and hea∣venly Affections, and the Comforts of Grace: These are the <HI>perfect Gifts</HI> from the Father of Spirits, and are more (infinitely more) than all present <HI>Riches.</HI> God gives the Power to <HI>eat</HI> our Bread, and use it <HI>holily.</HI> To him that has this Heart, he will add more Grace. He shall increase with the <HI>Increasings of God.</HI> Thus <HI>the liberal Soul is made fat</HI> in Spirituals, <HI>and he that watereth is watered again.</HI> And well re∣paid is he that <HI>sowes</HI> in worldly Things, and <HI>reaps</HI> in Spiritual: Like the <HI>Woman of Samaria</HI> who gave Christ a little common Water, and received of Him

He has said, <Q><HI>Thy Father which sees in secret will reward thee openly. Thou shalt be recompensed at the Resurrection of the Just.

<P>You must be <HI>just</HI> to God and your Selves, and make these <HI>Reasons</HI> of your Duty so many <HI>Motives</HI> to it.</P>
<P>You see 1. That the <HI>meanest Things</HI> may be of <HI>good and great Use</HI> to the <HI>Glory of God;</HI> and the most <HI>contrary Things</HI> be made to turn to our Salva∣tion. We may so serve God and our Selves of

This <HI>Blessing</HI> is come upon us <HI>Gentiles, thro' Faith</HI> in that <HI>Blessed Seed, in Whom the Families of the Earth are blessed:</HI> and thro' Whom <HI>the Offerings <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Gentiles</HI> are <HI>acceptable to God, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost.</HI> What can a Man give to God in <HI>Ex∣change for his Soul</HI> and the Souls of his House? will he give his <HI>Estate,</HI> and think it will be accepted? I trow not.</P>
<P>God values our <HI>Hearts and Spirits</HI> above all our Silver or Gold, our Herds and Flocks. <HI>If a Man would give all the Substance of his House instead of Love,</HI> the Loves of his Soul and the Souls of his House, <HI>it would be contemned.</HI> Thousands of <HI>Rams</HI> were a <HI>dogs-neck</HI> in lieu of the <HI>Love</HI> of one Soul.</P>
<P>We owe the first and greatest <HI>Piety and Charity</HI> to our <HI>Selves</HI> and at <HI>Home.</HI> We and ours are <HI>made</HI> for ever, if we are <HI>holy</HI> to the Lord: But we are profane and miserable without it.</P>
<P>The <HI>rich</HI> and the <HI>poor</HI> equally <HI>owe Themselves</HI> to God, and are equally <HI>able</HI> to render it. <HI>The Lord is the Maker of them both,</HI> and they are alike acceptable to Him. The <HI>one</HI> must be <HI>rich in good Works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate;</HI> and the <HI>other</HI> must be <HI>rich in Faith, Heirs of the Kingdom.</HI></P>
<P>It is a <HI>holy</HI> Thing to <HI>give</HI> unto <HI>such</HI> as these, <HI>from Faith and Love which is in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>I will read you, the <HI>best Offering</HI> that any Man can make to God! <HI>read</HI> it and <HI>make</HI> it, and I have done: Gen. xviii. 19. <HI>I know Abraham, that he will command his Children and his Houshold after him, and they shall keep the Way of the Lord; — that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which He hath spoken of him.</HI></P>
