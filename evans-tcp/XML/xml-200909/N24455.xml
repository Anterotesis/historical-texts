<P>Louis Le Guen complains of Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble in custody, &amp;c. for that whereas the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble, on the thirteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, were and long before had been, and ever since have been, and now are merchants and fac∣tors (to wit) at the city of New-York at the first ward of the said city and in the county of New-York, and during all that time, have carried on there the business of factors under the firm of Gouverneur and Kemble, and as such factors have been used to receive from divers persons, goods, wares and merchandizes, to be sold and disposed of upon the account of such persons respectively, and the same goods, wares and merchandize, to sell and dispose of upon such account, in consideration of certain rates of commission or factorage to them allowed upon the amounts of the sales by them made of such goods, wares and mer∣chandize, according to the usage and custom of the busi∣ness of factors aforesaid in the city aforesaid. And whereas the said Louis on the said thirteenth day of April in the year aforesaid, at the city, ward, and in the county aforesaid, was possessed of two hundred and fifty-seven thousand, one hundred and twenty-nine pounds of cotton-wool, and twelve thousand nine hundred and ninety-five pounds of indigo, as of his own proper goods and chat∣tels; and he the said Louis so being thereof possessed, it was then and there agreed by and between the said Louis, and the said Isaac Gouverneur and Kemble, that he the said Louis, should deliver the said cotton-wool and indigo to the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble, to be by <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and disposed of upon his account, and that they <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble, should sell and dispose of the same upon his said account, and should <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and pay, or become bound as sureties, for the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, duties and all other lawful and reasonable charges and expences <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and concerning the said cotton-wool and <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for so doing should be allowed a commission <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> upon the amount of the

<PB N="8" REF="032369_0007_0FF1FA48B550CDC0"/>
and undertakings, for and on behalf of the said Louis, as his factors, to wit, at the city, ward, and in the county aforesaid.</P>
<P>And the said Louis doth also aver, that afterwards and before the aforesaid twenty-fifth day of May, in the year aforesaid, that is to say, on the twenty-fourth day of May in the year aforesaid, at the city, ward, and in the county aforesaid, the said cotton-wool and indigo were by the said Abraham R. Rivera, Isaac Gomez, jun. and Moses Lopez, laden on board the ship aforesaid, then being in the port of the said city of New-York, and the said ship with the said cotton-wool and indigo on board, forthwith thereafter set sail from the said port of the said city of New-York, to proceed on her said voyage immediately to the port of Havre de Grace aforesaid; by reason whereof, they the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble were in duty bound to pur∣sue the direction and request of the said Louis as touching the exercise of the right, so as aforesaid reserved, to receive the whole or any part of the amount of the notes aforesaid at Havre de Grace aforesaid, or at any other port in Europe, where the said ship should discharge the said cotton-wool and indigo, together with the said premium thereupon; that is to say, within the limit and to the extent of the sum which would be due to the said Louis, upon the amount of the said notes, after reserving and deducting thereout so much as would be necessary and sufficient to satisfy the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble for the general balance of their account aforesaid, &amp; also to secure them for &amp; con∣cerning such further and other claims and demands, as they might and should be entitled to, and have by reason of their agency and undertakings, for &amp; on behalf of the said Louis, as his factors, and were also in duty bound, upon the re∣quest and direction of the said Louis, to give to the said Louis, power and authority to receive from the said Ab∣raham R. Rivera, Isaac Gomez, jun. and Moses Lopez, the residue of the amount of the said notes, after such de∣duction and reservation as aforesaid, together with the said premium thereupon, at Havre de Grace aforesaid, or at any
<PB N="9" REF="032369_0008_0FF1FA4E72C9D0D8"/>
other port in Europe, where the said ship should discharge the said cotton-wool and indigo, out of the said proceeds of the sales thereof. And in consideration thereof, they the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble afterwards, to wit, the same twenty-fifth day of May, in the year aforesaid, at the city, ward, and in the county aforesaid, undertook, and then and there faithfully promised the said Louis, to exer∣cise the right, so as aforesaid reserved, within the limit and to the extent aforesaid, pursuant to his request and direc∣tion, and to give to him, if by him requested and directed, the power and authority aforesaid; and the said Louis, in fact saith, that afterwards, to wit, the same twenty-fifth day of May, in the year aforesaid, and often afterwards, at the city, ward, and in the county aforesaid, he requested and directed the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble to elect to receive the amount of the said notes, or at their op∣tion, so much thereof as would be due to the said Louis, af∣ter deducting and reserving thereout so much as would be necessary and sufficient to pay and satisfy the said Isaac Gou∣verneur and Peter Kemble, for the general balance of their account aforesaid, and also to secure them for and concerning such further and other claims and demands, as they might and should be entitled to, and have, by reason of their agen∣cy and undertakings, for and on behalf of the said Louis, as his factors, at Havre de Grace aforesaid, or at any other port in Europe, where the said ship should discharge the said cotton-wool and indigo, out of the said proceeds of the sales thereof; and after such deduction and reservation made, to give to the said Louis power and authority, to re∣ceive from the said Abraham R. Rivera, Isaac Gomez, jun. and Moses Lopez, the residue of the amount of the said notes, together with the said premium thereupon, at Havre de Grace aforesaid, or at any other port in Europe, where the said ship should discharge the said cotton-wool and indigo, out of the said proceeds of the sales thereof. And the said Louis, further, in fact saith, that after such de∣duction and reservation as aforesaid made, there would remain due to him the said Louis, as for the residue of the amount of the said notes, a large sum of money, to wit,
<PB N="10" REF="032369_0009_0FF1FA5043E7BD98"/>
the sum of seventy thousand pounds current lawful money, of the state of New-York, of which the said Isaac Gouver∣neur and Peter Kemble then and there had notice. Never∣theless, the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble, not regarding their said promise and undertaking, according to their duty as the factors of the said Louis, so as aforesaid made, but contriving, and fraudulently, intending, craftily and subtilly to deceive and defraud the said Louis in this behalf, although often requested and directed thereunto as aforesaid, have not elected to receive the said amount of the said notes or any part thereof, at Havre de Grace aforesaid, or any other port in Europe, where the said ship should discharge the said cotton-wool and indigo, nor have they given to him, the said Louis, the power and authority so as aforesaid by him requested of them, as they ought to have done, but have wholly refused so to do. And also for that whereas the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble afterwards, to wit, on the first day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety-five, at the city, ward, and in the county aforesaid, were indebted to the said Louis Le Guen, in other seventy thousand pounds, current lawful money of the state of New-York, for monies by them the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble before that time had, and received to the use of him the said Louis, and the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble being so indebted in that behalf, afterwards (to wit) on the day and year last abovesaid, at the city, ward, and in the county aforesaid, in consideration there∣of undertook, and then and there faithfully promised the said Louis, to pay him the said seventy thousand pounds last mentioned, when they the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble should afterwards be thereunto requested. Nevertheless, the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kem∣ble, not regarding this said promise and undertaking last aforesaid, but contriving and fraudulently intending craf∣tily and subtilly to deceive and defraud the said Louis in this respect (although they have been often requested) have not paid the said seventy thousand pounds, or any part thereof to the said Louis, but have wholly refused and
<PB N="11" REF="032369_0010_0FF1FA5217E61290"/>
still do refuse to pay the same to him, to the said Louis his damage of seventy thousand pounds. And thereupon he brings suit, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And the said Isaac and Peter, by Martin S. Wilkins, their attorney, come and defend the force and injury, when, &amp;c. and say, that they did not undertake and pro∣mise in manner and form as the said Louis above com∣plains, and of this they put themselves upon the country, and the said Louis doth the like, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Therefore let a jury thereupon come before the people aforesaid, in their supreme court aforesaid, at the city of New-York, on the third Tuesday in October next, by whom, &amp;c. and who neither, &amp;c. to recognize, &amp;c. be∣cause as well, &amp;c. the same day is given to the parties aforesaid, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I had the honour of waiting upon you this morning, to advise with you respecting the steps to be taken to en∣sure the payment of the sales of cotton and indigo, which you made on my account to Messrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera; that object, so essential to me, ought not to be encumbered with any difficulty. I observe, however, and see it with pain, that we do not agree on the means and precautions to be taken. I presume that it is for want of understanding one another, being unfortunate enough not to speak your langauge, and an interpreter not being able to express the true meaning of a phrase which perhaps he does not understand perfectly. But this business being extremely important to me, and until we can agree upon this point, it is my wish, and I desire, 1st. That you insist on the conditions of the deed of sale, which relate to the insurance being performed, and require that the amount of the sale be entirely covered as well as the premium, that in all cases, the recovery of the insurance be sufficient for the payment of what is due to me. 2d. That you do not give any order for the disposal of the proceeds of this shipment without my knowledge and consent, that I may, if I think proper, avail myself of the fourth article of the contract, to receive the money in France or Ham∣burgh; and that we may come to a determination on this subject, be so obliging as to point out, and let me know the hour and place at which we may meet.

That the said Lou∣is Le Guen, then and there represented to the said Isaac Gouverneur, that the proceeds of the cargo were specially liable for the payment of the money due from the pur∣chasers, that he could not be burthened with the amount of the freight and premium of insurance, and demanded that the purchasers should give security for the payment of these objects, independent of the proceeds of the cotton and indigo, and that the said Isaac Gouverneur thereupon repeated to the said Isaac Gomez, jun. that the cargo was his property, and that he could dispose of it.

<LETTER>

<SALUTE>Messrs. Gouverneur and Kemble, Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I had the honour on the 29th of last month to request of your Isaac Gouverneur, on behalf of your house as my agents, that the Hamburgh vessel the White Fox, capt. Van Berend Edward Haberstrok, might not depart till the insurance to be made, pursuant to the contract with Messrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, was entirely com∣pleted as we had agreed, nor before the requisite disposi∣tions were made to secure the application of the proceeds of the cargo of cotton and indigo sold them on my ac∣count to the payment of what was due to me; having elected as I had a right to do, to receive the amount at one of the ports of discharge. Towards this end, I re∣quested that my account with you might be prepared, in order to be adjusted, and that I might be enabled by the possession of the notes or some competent authorization, and an authenticated copy of the contract of sale, to re∣ceive the sum which was coming to me out of the pro∣ceeds
<PB N="26" REF="032369_0025_0FF1FA8F057B8C98"/>
of the cargo—and informed him that it was my in∣tention, thus provided and enabled to go in person to Eu∣rope, to attend the progress of the affair and receive the payment to which I was entitled, that I had accordingly engaged a fast sailing vessel to carry me, and that the ne∣cessary arrangements being made, I should depart the third or fourth instant, to give my personal attention to the course of an affair of primary importance to me, and thereby perhaps prevent any disastrous consequences which might otherwise arise. These desires, intentions and expecta∣tions were afterwards reiterated by me, but not being met as I could hope, I, on the 30th of May, wrote the letter of which a copy is herewith transmitted, and to which I received no answer. To my surprise, I learnt the next day, that the vessel had sailed, and I am this moment igno∣rant that any adequate means have been attempted to se∣cure the application of the proceeds of the cargo, accord∣ing to the wi<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h which I communicated, and the right re∣served me by the contract, and I remain unfurnished with any documents or means by which I might take the measures that might appear to me adviseable. Even the precaution which I urged of addressing to the house of Le Conteulx and Co. of Rouen, an authen∣ticated copy of the contract of sale, to the end that they might take care of my interest, was at that time refused, and as far as I know, has been omitted. To en∣crease the inconvenience of my situation, I am left with the embarassment of having on my hands the vessel I had hired to convey me to Europe, and may be exposed to loss from that source. In this situation I am sorry to be obli∣ged to think that your house has failed in observing to∣wards me a conduct, corresponding with my rights and in∣tered, and I conclude, that it has made itself responsible for whatever losses may ensue. Desirous of obviating, however, as for as may still be possible, eventual misfor∣<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> to any party, I offer myself to co-operate with you in concerting without loss of time, such measures as may <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> practicable to give effect to the operation according to the true intent, and the rights of each party. To this end,
<PB N="27" REF="032369_0026_0FF1FA90C2210370"/>
we may avail ourselves of such legal or other advice, as the nature of the case may render it useful. But this offer is made upon the express condition, that the proposed co-ope∣ration shall not derogate in the end, from any claim upon your responsibility for consequences which may at this time exist, and that I shall retain the same rights and rem∣edies that I might have if no such co-operation had taken place. With great consideration, I have the honour to be,</P>

<P>We enclose you herewith an, account sales of the goods that were placed in our hands, which render £54,196,11,10 for their net proceeds. We also hand you a statement of our account current, and when we are in the receipt of all the money resulting from the sales of these goods and the drawback of the duties, there will be coming to you a ba∣lance of £ 47544, 15, 6. We further state, there will be coming to us £ 6256, 2, 6, to cover the present advances, &amp;c. besides which we are responsible for the charter of the ship White Fox, in £ 3733, 6, 8. on your account. Under these circumstances we have grounded an objection to give you an authorization to receive the money in France for the sales of the goods, until we are first re-em∣bursed and made secure. We have no objection to co∣operate with you for the ultimate security of the property upon fair principles of justice and equity. And if you
<PB N="28" REF="032369_0027_0FF1FA9440442D20"/>
have separated yourselves from us with a view to entangle or make us in any respect, liable for the sale to Messrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, we trust you will find a disap∣pointment; such an idea is too ridiculous to admit of a moment's serious consideration. In justice to those gen∣tlemen who have become the purchasers of the goods, we think proper to observe, that they are men of property and fair characters, and that we are disposed to treat them with a degree of delicacy throughout this unfortunate transaction, which will evidently end in a considerable loss, and prove a gross deception by their not having a competent knowledge in the article of cotton, it would therefore be with reluctance that we should undertake any thing that might operate to their prejudice or injury. Still we are not unwilling to devote ourselves to your in∣terest, nor do we see any reason for all the difficulties and anxieties your imagination is apparently troubled with, without sustaining any real cause of alarm.</P>

<SALUTE>Messrs. Gouverneur and Kemble, Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I received yesterday your letter of the 6th inst. with the accounts mentioned in it, which to my surprise takes no direct notice of my letter to you of the same date. I pass by the singular insinuation which it contains, and confine myself to the real business in question between us. I observe with regret, that (though you have dropped one of the items which originally composed your claim, the premiums of insurance) you persist in the idea of retain∣ing exclusively in your command and disposition, the whole of my property on the ground of a lien upon it, arising from your agency, which according to your own state∣ment amounts to little more than one fifth of its value, and adhere to your objection, to give me an authorization to receive any part of it. It was ever my intention, and as I conceived imported in my original propositions, to provide for your payment and security to the extent of your just claims, as the condition of the authorization, I demand of you to receive what was rightfully coming to me. This was equally the intention of the co-operation proposed by my letter of the sixth, and I continue disposed to enter into that co-operation upon this principle. It is true there are several items in your account, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> which we differ in opinion; yet I am ready to make suitable re∣servations and arrangements towards a right adjustment of them, but I cannot conceive that this ought to have pre∣vented, or ought now to impede precautions and measures tending to secure a due application of the proceeds of the cargo, and to put me in possession of the funds to which I am indubitably entitled, and according to the election which was reserved for my benefit in the terms of the con∣tract. On this ground of putting me in a situation to pos∣sess without delay, that to which I am indisputably enti∣tled, and of leaving your just and legal claims upon the property, and otherwise, unimpaired, I am still willing
<PB N="34" REF="032369_0033_0FF1FAAD622499C0"/>
to co-operate. But as I conceive there were pretensions and omissions in the first instance, which render you res∣ponsible for consequences, as it may now be too late to re∣pair the deficiency, as every moment's delay increases the risks, I still make the offer of co-operation, on the con∣dition of holding you in the same state of responsibility in which you were prior to that offer. At the same time it will be explicitly understood, that in acceding to the co∣operation on this condition, you do not incur any new or additional responsibility. With this explanation, I urge an immediate and positive answer whether you will con∣cur in an arrangement on this base. Moments are preci∣ous. That which might be useful now, may quickly be∣come useless by procrastination. The nature of the co∣operation will be an after consideration. The terms to be settled between us, according to our mutual opinions, and the advice we may mutually take.</P>

<SALUTE>Louis de Guen, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR favor of yesterday is received. It is not our wish to throw any embarrassments in your way, but the magnitude of our claims, and our engagements in your behalf, render it proper that we proceed with caution. To stop the ship until the insurance was completed, was not in our power. Messrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera stipulated to make insurance, but this might be done, as well after, as before the vessel sailed; and if neglected al∣together, it would amount to a breach of contract only, for which the vessel could not be detained. With respect to the premium for insurance paid by us, although we omitted it in our last account, we do not assent to the force of your objection to the payment of it. The insurance being effected for your benefit and security, it is more reasonable that you should run the hazard of
<PB N="35" REF="032369_0034_0FF1FAB14733C000"/>
recovering back the premium than we, who act only as agents. To remove however every impediment to a settlement, and manifest a spirit of accommodation, this charge has been for the present dropped. We cannot forbear remarking, that notwithstanding your solicitude to obtain the authorization in question, you constantly uphold a claim upon us for certain consequences, without pointing out in what manner we may have rendered our∣selves responsible. Although we are not conscious of any act which can give you this claim, and are therefore easy on this head, yet you cannot but perceive the im∣propriety of our admitting, that we have incurred this responsibility, which we should do, were we to come to a settlement upon the terms proposed by you. As to our lien on the notes, and other documents relating to this transaction, we never had any doubt of our right to with∣hold them, and also to refuse you any authority to act, until the whole of our demand was satisfied, and we sa∣tisfactorily secured against contingent claims. Indeed as the contract is in our name, and we are bound under a penalty of 20,000 dollars to endorse on the notes, which are also in our favor, the payments as they are made, we might insist (were we disposed as you insinuate to create difficulties) upon all the monies passing through our hands, or those of an agent chosen by us, and for that purpose keep possession of every paper until the transaction was finally closed. But we are sincerely anxious to put an end to a controversy, which did not originate with us; for this purpose we beg leave to refer you to our letter of the 6th instant, in which we were so explicit as to the terms upon which we were willing to give you the au∣thority you desire, and to co-operate with you, that no∣thing remains to be added. To give you, however, a further proof of our wish for a speedy and amicable ar∣rangement, we are willing, if these terms are not agree∣able to you, to submit the whole matter to arbitration.</P>

<P>From this exposition, it appears, that all the claims of Messrs. Gouverneur and Kemble ought to be confined to that arising from the bond, they have given at the customs, for the due return of the certificates of the landing of the said goods in a foreign port, amounting to Dol. 12086, 87. Desirous of disposing of my property, and being deter∣mined
<PB N="38" REF="032369_0037_0FF1FABD1FA6E7C0"/>
to make use of the right which has been reserved to me, in the second and fourth articles of the contract of sale made to Messrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, ena∣bling me to receive the whole or any part of their obliga∣tion in France, I decide on making the following pro∣posals to Messrs. Gouverneur and Kemble, which will convince them of my disposition to come to an arrange∣ment.</P>
<P N="1">1st. To give me an authenticated copy of the con∣tract of sale, and authorization to receive out of the pro∣ceeds of the cargo, after the freight will have been paid, and immediately after that payment only, one hundred thousand dollars, in part of the obligations of Messrs. Go∣mez, Lopez and Rivera, enabling me fully to receive that sum.</P>
<P N="2">2d. To keep at their disposal the balance of the above mentioned obligations, amounting to dollars 22415 37 for their bond to the customs, saving to myself the dispo∣sal of this balance when the landing certificates are ar∣rived, and after the final settlement of our account.</P>
<P N="3">3d. To drop for the present all altercations, respecting the responsibility which I have a right to exercise against Messrs. Gouverneur and Kemble, if the delay of the ne∣cessary dispositions in France should be productive of some injury to me in the recovery of the obligations of the purchasers of my goods.</P>
<P>I presume that Messrs. Gouverneur and Kemble will be so much the more disposed to acquiesce to the above proposals, that they have ever intimated the high opinion they had of the honesty and solvability of Messrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, and that the obligations of those pur∣chasers of dollars 22415 37 are only designed to insure in the course of twelve months the arrival of the certifi∣cates of the due landing of the said goods, which certifi∣cates cost them nothing, and which Messrs. Gomez, Lo∣pez and Rivera have engaged to return, by one of the ar∣ticles of the contract.</P>

<P>Desirous as we are of coming to an accommodation with you, we cannot, consistent with a regard to our own security, accede to the propositions which accompanied your favour of this date. We deem ourselves entitled to a re-embursement out of the first proceeds of the cotton and indigo. If therefore we authorize you to receive one hundred thousand dollars, it may exhaust the whole of the proceeds—in which case our security will be con∣siderable diminished, as we could have recourse only to Messrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, on their notes.</P>
<P>The proposals we have already made and repeated, are those to which we must yet adhere, they being such as the nature of the transaction and our own safety point our. We also beg leave to remark to you, that we are desirous of some prompt decision to the business, as it becomes urksome and unpleasant to us to magnify so many words about it under any imaginary pretensions, and as it be∣comes necessary for our I. G's. health (who has the princi∣pal management of it with you) that he should go into the country, we acquaint you that he will remain but a few days more in town, before he will set off on a jaunt that will occupy him some weeks abroad—we are there∣fore desirous of hearing from you immediately, in point, upon this question, to understand finally any determination that is to be made.</P>

<P>I cannot easily express my chagrin at your reply of the 12th to my letter of the 12th instant, I had hoped that my propositions would have appeared to you entirely reasona∣ble,
<PB N="40" REF="032369_0039_0FF1FAC4E959B180"/>
or at least that you would have made me such others in return of a specific nature, as you did yourselves ap∣prove. But instead of this, you merely refer me to your former propositions, of which I know not any except a reference to arbitration—I am obliged therefore to con∣clude still more firmly than heretofore, that it is your de∣termination at all events to retain my whole property in your disposition, till the final winding up of the specula∣tion by Messrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, and the re∣ceipt by you in this country of the proceeds of my car∣go. Thus depriving me of the election which was re∣served by the terms of the contract, to receive the money coming to me in Europe, and disappointing all the mea∣sures I had taken and projected on this basis. I protest once more against this mode of proceeding, and all the consequences of it, and I demand for the last time, that you forthwith furnish me with an authenticated copy of the contract of sale, and with a competent authorization, to receive at the port of discharge, whatever sum shall re∣main of the proceeds of the goods sold on my account to Messrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, after first deducting and reserving at your disposal, such a sum as shall be com∣pletely sufficient to cover you for the general balance of your account, and for all that you have made yourselves accountable for on my account, also for the commissions you claim as well on the receipt as on the sale, and even for damages in case of protest of the bill of exchange to be drawn for the freight or charter money, and for insur∣ance of the money which you claim to cover you for your advances and responsibilities to the United States. This nevertheless is not to be understood as a final admis∣sion of any claims on your part, which may not be ac∣cording to law, and the usage of trade; but as a prelimi∣nary arrangement for your eventual security. I further declare, that any other security you now rightfully possess is to remain unimpaired by your compliance with this de∣mand. As I am not less anxious than you can be, to ter∣minate this discussion, Hope for your immediate answer,

<P>Upon reviewing our late correspondence, we cannot but think that we have manifested every disposition to bring the controversy between us to a speedy and amicable deter∣mination. We have offered, and again repeat the proposal, that we will deliver into your hands, all the papers and notes which regard this transaction without delay, upon your giving us satisfactory security in this country; to pay us in a reasonable time our commission, and such sums as we may have disbursed, or made ourselves responsible for, on your account, and also sufficiently secure us against the payment of such sums as we may eventually be called upon by reason of our interference in this business. When it is considered that we have a right to insist upon immediate payment of the balance of our account, as the condition of our delivering up these papers, you cannot deem this proposition unreasonable. We are certainly not obliged to receive payment in France, especially at a time when so many difficulties attend getting money from that country, and were we to accede to the terms held out by your favour of this date, we should be obliged to wait the event of an application for the money to Mess. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera in France, before we could have recourse to you. Much more has already been said upon this subject than was necessary; to conclude, we conceive ourselves entitled to keep all the securities we have at present, and were we disposed to be litigious, we might, even now, apply to you in a judicial way for payment of our demand. This being our situation, we have no hesitation in rejecting your offers of this day as inadmissible. If you are so solicitous of having authenticated copies of the contract, and an autho∣rization
<PB N="42" REF="032369_0041_0FF1FACA5A4E3508"/>
to receive the money, we are willing to give them upon the terms herein before mentioned, or upon any other which three indifferent Gentlemen shall point out. We hope this proposal will not only be deemed fair, but that it will remove the chagrin occasioned by ours of the twelfth instart.</P>

<P>I have received your letter of yesterday. Well satisfi∣ed that the pretensions which you advance (as far as I re∣collect for the first time) in that letter, as the condition of delivering into my hands the papers and notes which re∣gard the transaction in question between us, are not war∣ranted by the usage of trade, as relative to the course of business; I will only remark to you, that whatever might have been the case, prior to the departure of the cargo, and if you had then been willing to come to a proper adjustment of the affair with me, has been rende∣red impracticable by the change of circumstances. By your not meeting me duly when I demanded of you my account, to the end that it might be adjusted and settled to your entire satisfaction and full discharge, by your re∣fusing to permit any intervention of mine in the affair, by your declaring that you took all upon yourselves, and engaging or encouraging the buyers to depart with the car∣go immediately, you have placed me under the impossibi∣lity of putting into execution any of the dispositions I had meditated, and now that I am deprived of my property as the mean of engaging the aid and interpositions of friends, a demand is made upon me which for its indefiniteness alone is altogether exceptionable. I confine myself therefore to demanding of you without delay, an authenticated and certified copy of the contract of sale made with Mess Go∣mez, Lopez and Rivera, and to declaring to you, that in
<PB N="43" REF="032369_0042_0FF1FAD00CC54980"/>
as much as you have by the circumstances which preceded the departure of the cargo, and in addition thereto by re∣fusing to comply with all the propositions and demands I have made you since, entirely deranged my plans, and de∣prived me of the power of commanding my funds in France, and of all the advantage from the employment of them there, I hold you responsible, and shall insist upon your responsibility for all losses, damages, and disadvanta∣ges which may ensue, including an indemnification for the derangement of the measures I had adopted for proceed∣ing in person to France, to possess myself of my pro∣perty.</P>

<P>We have received a letter from you this day, dated on the first of the month, wherein you make an enquiry respecting a certificate Mr. Barretto presented to us to cancel our bond for some sugars exported in the White Fox. We wanted Mr. Barretto to leave us the certificate to see if it could be made to answer that purpose as it was irregular, but he objected to it before he had seen Mr. Cherriot. Since then we have heard nothing further about it—if it is in your possession, it would be well for you to send it to us, and we will see what may be further needful. We have received from the custom house, the debenture of duties on your goods which we shall ac∣count for—but we must be indemnified for our bonds, or the needful papers must be returned to us to procure them cancelled. Directions were given Mr. Gomez for that purpose respecting the goods under his care, but the su∣gar in question he never had any thing to do with. That unfortunate adventure of Mr. Gomez, as we were well aware of, is like to turn to a ruinous account. After waiting some time at Havre, he has been obliged to ex∣pose it <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> further risks, and expences by proceeding to Ham∣burgh for a market. Under all these disagreeable circum∣stances, attending so respectable a property, we cannot help regretting that you have withdrawn yourself from us, and the steps you have been pursuing, which must ul∣timately operate to your prejudice while it appears to us so needful you should have associated with us, to have concerted all necessary means for its preservation and se∣curity which we have at all times held ourselves open to

<P>I have received the letter you have addressed me on the 17th instant; Mr. Barretto has not explained himself well to me, if he had, I would have sent you the certifi∣cate in question; it is annexed with this letter and you will see that they have drawn it in the name of John Richard, jun. as if he had been the shipper. I wish it could be admitted at the custom house, to cancel your bond. The declaration to recover the drawback has been made either in your name or in that of Mr. Gomez, joint∣ly with the cotton and indigos, as it appears by your hav∣ing received the debentures for the duties paid.</P>
<P>In case that certificate could not answer the purpose, I beg you would send me a copy of the declaration made when the goods were shipped, to enable me to write at Havre accordingly, and have a declaration made in support of the above certificate; you will oblige me to send it as soon as possible, to use the first opportunity to write for that purpose; as to the latter part of your letter, I must refer you to the correspondence heretofore had between us for an answer; with this single observation in addi∣tion, that the suggestion of co-operation at time of day af∣ter the obstacles to it, when it might have been a means of security, appears to me rather out of season.

<P>WE acquainted you a few days since, that the certifi∣cate transmitted us had been found sufficient at the cus∣tom-house to cancel our bond that was given on the sugar shipt to Havre de Grace. Yesterday we received from Mr. Gomez at Hamburgh the certificate relative to the cotton and indigo, which is not made conformable to the directions given him, and consequently won't answer to cancel our bond at the custom-house, as the collector will not accept of it. We herewith inclose it to you, together with copies of a letter from Mr. Gomez to us, and one to Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, for your government, to adopt such stepts as you may think proper, to the end of preserving your property.</P>

<P>I herewith inclose the certificate of the landing of the cargo here, for to enable you to recover the drawback according to your desire. Markets being in a most miserable situation in France, induced me to bring the cotton and indigo here, which proves as bad, as it will not yield the amount of invoice and expences thereon at∣tending, by a loss of at least sixty per cent; of which I have by this opportunity informed my house, who will confer with you on the occasion. In my next I shall advise my house for the payment of insurance, and amount due H. Dorhman on account of charter-party. I have the honor to be,</P>

<P>WITH your favor of the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> inst. I received the cer∣tificate which Mr. Gomez has sent you of the landing at Hamburgh of the cotton and indigo per ship White Fox, which not being drawn conformably to the instruc∣tions you had given him, has been rejected by the col∣lector of the custom-house. Not being myself well ac∣quainted with the forms prescribed, and not knowing the instructions you may have given Mr. Gomez, I cannot judge in what point it is deficient, but I think there is yet time enough to have it corrected; and I return it with this letter, so that you make of it what use you think fit. The same letter covered also copy of a letter from Mr. Gomez to your house, dated at Hamburgh the 12th of August; with another copy of a letter which the same gentleman wrote the same day to his house of Gomez, Lopez and Rivera. I am sorry to see that affair turn out so unfavourably, and the loss which those gentlemen are likely to suffer from it. It is one of those accidents to which every speculation of that kind is exposed; and I am yet in hopes that the result will not be so unfavour∣able as Mr. Gomez seems to apprehend, by the start of the price of cotton in the London market, and a little patience. However the business may turn out, I should hope that you have taken every precaution to insure to yourselves the whole amount of the obligations of Messrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera, and should be sorry if you were to suffer on account of the issue of that operation. For my part, I can do no more than to refer you to what I proposed in my preceding letters, and repeat again to you, that I am yet disposed to co-operate with you, and ready to take the measures which might appear most ad∣visable for the preservation of that property: provided always, that that co-operation shall not in the least im∣pair my claim to your responsibility; reserving to myself at the same time all my rights to it, as it such a co∣operation

<P>YOUR favour of this date has been duly received. While we regret the great loss which Messrs. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera are in danger of sustaining by this un∣fortunate speculation, and that you may eventually be a sufferer, we think it incumbent on us to repeat to you, lest our silence might be misconstrued, that we do not in any event hold ourselves responsible to you for any thing beyond what shall be actually received on the notes of those gentlemen. The sale was concluded under your immediate direction, and you well know that no security was received in payment but the notes of the purchasers; we are at a loss therefore, what you can mean, by hoping that we have taken every precaution to secure the whole amount of this obligation. We know of no measures necessary to pursue for the preservation of the property, having received no intelligence of its being in any other danger than that of not finding a good market. But if you think any thing can be done for your interest, we shall cheerfully pursue such reasonable directions as you may give us as your agents on the subject. We thank you for your expressions of sorrow on our account; but on a review of our conduct, we find no room for charg∣ing ourselves with any neglect or inattention to your concern, and see no occasion therefore, as far as we are personally concerned, to be alarmed at the issue of this business.</P>

<P>As a vessel will sail in a day or two for Hamburgh, we take the liberty to inform you, that we are willing, if it will meet your approbation, to authorize the American consul residing at that port, or any other gentleman we can mutually agree upon, to receive from Messrs. Go∣mez, Lopez and Rivera, payment on account of their notes, agreeable to the fourth article of their contract with us. If you deem any other authority necessary, we shall have no objection to join in it, if the same shall be consistent with our safety and security. As Mr. Gomez is at Hamburgh with the cargo, it is probable such au∣thority will find him there, and that he will be disposed to treat with our agent upon fair and equitable terms. The money we propose to remain in the consul's hands, subject to our draft, or subject to your order; provided you will either pay, or give us good security, for our demands against you. In case of any difficulty in ad∣justing our account, we will submit the same to the month∣ly committee of the chamber of commerce, or to any other indifferent persons.</P>

<P>I have received your two letters of the 7th and 8th instant, the last inclosing one from Mess. Gomez, Lopez and Rivera of the 7th. You are perfectly apprised of the ground on which I conceive myself to stand. I have made a contract upon a definite price, and I have legal advice upon which I rely, that you are my guarantee in case of disastrous consequences, looking to your responsibility, I feel tranquil for the event, and I cannot be expected to abandon or weaken so good a ground. With this saving, which I make once for all, as to what I now add, or may hereafter say upon the subject, I reply, to your first letter, that I think it would be for the interest of all concerned, that the proceeds of the cargo in Hamburg should be paid into the hands of, and deposited with some person, or house of unquestionable responsibility. Not being acquainted with the mercantile standing of the American consul, I can say nothing, but I have entire confidence in either of the houses of Mess. Bernherd and Nootnagal, Lubbert and Dumas, and Matthuson and Silem. To your second let∣ter, that were I in consideration of the probably unfortu∣nate issue of the adventure (rendered so however as, I con∣ceive from ill management) disposed to make a voluntary sacrifice, the proposition of Mess.

<P>We wished for your sake to pursue joint measures with respect to the property sold Mess. Gomez, Lopez and Ri∣vera, as the interest of all parties naturally pointed out, and under this impression addressed you on the 7th and 8th instant. Your answer satisfies us that you have no other object in view, than to induce us to take some steps that may place us in a situation of responsibility, which we do not think proper to incur. As to our having already ren∣dered ourselves answerable for the amount of the sales, we do not believe you sincerely entertain the idea yourself. The only definite terms upon which you ever demanded the authorization, which is made the pretext of a misun∣derstanding between us, and which are contained in your letter of the 12th June, are such as we conceived ourselves warranted in rejecting at that time, and have had no reason to change our opinion. The reasons which influ∣enced us have already been detailed and are too obvious to require repetition. To discuss this point further will nei∣ther be pleasant nor useful. We are prepared to meet the question in any shape you may choose to bring it forward, in full confidence of having discharged our trust with in∣tegrity, and every proper attention to your interest, and a perfect reliance on those tribunals which must ultimately decide between us. Under a conviction however, that it is your wish that we may assume a discretion which may eventually render us liable, we think proper to inform you that we shall not empower any house in Europe to receive any payment on the notes we hold, without an express au∣thority from you in writing for that purpose. Unless we receive explicit directions from you on this <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, we shall think it our duty to wait until the money is remitted to
<PB N="52" REF="032369_0051_0FF1FAF6A0C90930"/>
this country, or until we receive advice that it is placed in Europe, so as to be commanded by us without any risque. Your answer respecting an arbitration, is not less evasive than other parts of your letter, but it is not surprising that such should be your language so long as you "feel tranquil about the event," and while you rely with so much confi∣dence on our guarantee in case of disastrous consequences We have only to add, that although a further correspond∣ence will probably be productive of as salutary consequences, yet we shall ever continue ready until the final settlement of this business, to listen to such instructions as you may have a right to give, and we consistently with our own safety and interest pursue.</P>

<P>I have received your letter of this day. I will only re∣reply to one point of it, you mistate in supposing I wished to draw you into any new responsibility; my only intenti∣on is not to release you from any to which you are now subject. I thought had sufficiently explained myself on the subject of the deposit of the proceeds of the cargo at Hamburgh, but since I have been misunderstood I will add that I entirely approve the idea, that if the deposit be made with <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the houses I have mentioned, or with any other we may agree upon, I will take the risks of it to the extent of the sum deposited, and it shall in no wise be dee∣med to implicate you in any new responsibility. But I <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to this only on the ground, that I cannot obtain from you an authorization to receive the proceeds my∣self, which I should prefer, and if obtained, would imme∣diately depart for Hamburg.

entered into, or responsibilities to which they had exposed themselves in consequence of said agency, with which of∣fers and proposals the plaintiff neglected and refused to comply, but whether by reason of the premises the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble, became liable to the said Louis Le Guin, as is stated in the first count of his declaration, the said jurors are ignorant, and they pray the advice of the court in the premises. And if the court of the people here, shall be of opinion, that the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble by reason of the said pre∣mises, have made themselves liable to pay the plaintiff the amount agreed on by the said contract as the price of the said cotton and indigo, then the said jurors do say, up∣on their said oath, that the said Isaac Gouverneur and Pe∣ter Kemble, did undertake and promise, in manner and form, as the said Louis Le Guen hath, in and by the first count of his said declaration above alledged, and they assess the damages of the said Louis Le Guen, by reason there∣of over and above his costs and charges by him about his suit in that behalf expended, to one hundred and nineteen thousand three hundred and two dollars and sixty-six cents, and for those costs and charges to six cents, but if the said court shall be of opinion, that the said Isaac Gou∣verneur and Peter Kemble, did not, by reason of the pre∣mises, become liable as aforesaid, then the said jurors find that the said Isaac Gouverneur and Peter Kemble, did not undertake and promise in manner and form as the said Louis Le Guen hath in and by the said first count of his said declaration above alledged.</P>
