<HEAD>A Mathematical Question.</HEAD>
<P>AMONGST a variety of pleasing cu∣riosities, which, in the bloom of youth, attracted my attention, I found a pe∣culiar taste to <HI>mathematical studies.</HI> I fancied myself qualified to answer hard questions, solve difficulties, and determine things abstruse; but, in the course of my pursuits, I was accosted by an accomplished mathematician, who confounded all my skill, by propounding to me a question, stated in the following order.</P>
<P>There is a certain large country, formerly a kingdom, so rich and flourishing, that for excel∣lency and dignity, it was the second in the universe; an island, situate in the midst of the temperate zone, and surrounded with the pacific ocean; free from all scorching heat, chilling cold, or molesta∣tion by storms; no barren land, unhealthful wa∣ters, or infectious air, were found therein; no prickling bramble, poisonous herb, or unhwholsome fruit, grew therein; no ravenous bird, voracious beast, or venomous reptile, infested the land: it abounded with all the substantial blessings of life: and was embellished with all the beauties and de∣corations of nature. There was no deficiency of any thing that might conduce to the felicity of the inhabitants, who enjoyed uninterrupted health and peace, liberty and plenty.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="009151_0003_10310C0DB3089728"/>This delightful realm was subject to the grand Monarch of the world, who honoured it with many gracious visits, conferred on it many royal favours, and granted the inhabitants all the privileges that were necessary to constitute them a free and happy people: and, to consummate their glory, a king of their own nation; he dignified in the throne, and crowned with glory had honour, the eldest prince of the blood; a person endued with amplitude of all natural perfections, a noble genius, untainted virtue, and of perfect stature, without blemish; and gave him to wife a royal princess, a perfect virgin, of exquisite beauty, accomplished with all the virtues, and amiable qualities, which adorn the female sex.</P>
<P>And for the safety of the state, because the coasts were not inaccessible, neither were the fortifi∣cations impregnable, and the prince was but young; therefore, the universal Sovereign recommended him, and all his subjects, to the super-intendency of his <HI>grand Geometrician;</HI> by whose infallible di∣rections the universal empire is justly proportioned, and all the affairs thereof accurately regulated; whose representations are all the stated in the exactest manner; his descriptions appear in the most curious figures, and all his rules are models of perfection: his draughts are a compleat system of rectitude and harmony, and his instructions are perfectly refined; so that he is a consummate pattern of absolute infallibility. No cause can miscarry that is directed by his council, nor can any people cease to be happy, so long as they yield ample subjection to his dictates. —This great master of science was appointed guardian, regent, vicegerent, or governor of the whole realm, to preside over, and inspect all the affairs of the prince and the people: to him they were accountable for all their actions; and, to prevent any infraction or confusion
<PB N="3" REF="009151_0004_10310C0F3A469FF8"/>
in the land, every circumstance was subject to his cognizance; and the tenure whereby all the Inha∣bitants held their estates and enjoyments, was, conformity to his most excellent prescriptions. Thus this beatific region was amply accommodated with every enjoyment that was necessary to per∣petuate its felicity.</P>
<P>But a foreigner, of the race of the giants, who, for their rebellion against the King of kings, were ba∣nished from the royal palace, into the unilluminable desert, found means, in disguise, to enter this spa∣cious country; and, by false pretences, and feigned address, obtained access to the princess; until, by subtile arts, and delusive flatteries, he prevailed against her chastity: so she committed adultery with him, and conceived by him. And, while she was advancing in her pregnancy, she prevailed against the virtue of the prince, so that he polluted himself, by committing adultery with her. For, though she was his wife, it was adultery for a per∣son in his station to have conversation with her, since she was so basely deflowered. And so it was, that he conceived by her, and they both became pregnant with the same thing, and brought forth a <HI>monster.</HI> As soon as this monster was born, the prince and princess fell from the throne, and had no more capacity to sway the sceptre, or maintain their dignity; for he poisoned, with his first breath, the man and the woman who brought him forth: all their excellent qualities were corrupted, all their beauties deformed, and all their glory laid in the dust. They died a lingering death, in exile, shame, and sorrow; and their names have been had in execration throughout the world ever since.</P>
<P>The form of this unnatural production was so horrible, as astonished every eye that beheld him; his roaring so hideous, as made every ear tingle <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="4" REF="009151_0005_0F869EC1B38400E8"/>
every one sick where the scent came; and he grew to such an enormous size, that his shadow filled the whole land with darkness; and so invincible in his power, that no army upon earth was able to with∣stand him; and he became so voracious, that he spread death and destruction wherever he came; swallowing up men and women alive, devouring every living creature, and making the whole land a desolate wilderness.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding the horrors that appear in this monster, the mischeif done, and misery intro∣duced by him, which manifestly proves him to be an enemy to nature; yet, he is such a master of enchantments, and has the delusive art of disguising himself, and infatuating the people, that he has drawn all the inhabitants of the land into a conse∣deracy with him, to break all the measures of the governor: and they accordingly have cast off all allegiance to, and despised all the admonitions of, their faithful guardian, and are in open rebellion against him. They, like a distracted banditti, follow their mortal foe, and execute his cursed projects; while he is sporting himself with their wretchedness; distressing them with all kinds of torture, and destroying them by all kinds of death. None escape him, of whatever condition, age, or sex they be; he tyrannizes over all. And every creature, that is subjugated by him, must fall a prey to his rapacious fury, and is destined to ine∣vitable destruction.—And, if he be permitted thus to proceed, there will not be left alive a soul to breathe in the whole land.</P>
<P>Wherefore, the design of the ensuing question is, to discover, whether there be a possibility of any expedient being found, to stop the ravage of this horrible monster, to prevent the direful effects of his tyranny, and save the country from total ruin.</P>

<P>When this master of skill, first laid before me this question. I looked upon it with an air of disdain, as being matter too easy to be made the
<PB N="6" REF="009151_0007_10310C1AC82C6840"/>
subject of serious attention; and thought to solve it, as a diversion only: but, having pondered a while thereon, and finding some difficulties arise, I asked him, whether he himself was the projector?</P>
<P>But (in reply) he asked me what conceptions I formed concerning it?</P>
<P>I told him, I took it to be an enigmatical prob∣lem, proposed to puzzle, or try the skill of the ingenious.</P>
<P>But he gravely replied, that it was not fiction, but reality; that the matter was too serious to be made a <HI>droll of wit;</HI> and that a determinate solution was a concern of the utmost consequence.</P>
<P>I asked him, whether it immediately concerned himself?</P>
<P>He told me, he himself was the rightful gover∣nor of the country, which this monster had so long infested; and that all the damage done, was against his honour; to the injury of his government, and the destruction of subjects, under his jurisdiction.</P>
<P>I asked him (since he was governor) if it was not in his power to resist, and expel the monster out of his dominions?</P>
<P>He told me, it was utterly out of his power to destroy him, to stop his progress, or prevent the effects of his fury; otherwise he would not have suffered him to proceed in his violence, to that outrageous degree as he had done: for, before this monster was born, he took all proper mea∣sures to prevent any such unnatural birth; and, as soon as he was brought forth, he pursued him with the utmost diligence, to seize and destroy him, but unsuccessfully; and, since he grew so formida∣ble, he had still continued to use all possible means, both offensive and defensive, to prevent his de∣structive measures; but the utmost success he had ever been able to obtain against this deadly enemy, was only, at some times, a little to retard his ra∣pidity,
<PB N="7" REF="009151_0008_10310C1C8AD4B480"/>
but never to withstand his force; but, in spite of all his endeavours, the whole land was become a prey to this tyrant; not a creature had escaped, but what either followed him as a willing slave, groaned under thraldom to his merciless cruelty, or had already perished by his insatiable voracity. And since it appeared utterly impos∣sible for the governor to save the life of one of his subjects, he was determined to vindicate his honour, and defend his right some other way; for which reason he presented to me this question, re∣quiring a determinate answer.</P>
<P>Upon this, I began to deliberate on the question with more close attention: but the more I exa∣mined it, the more difficult it appeared; and I be∣gan to be convinced of my mistake, in imagining it a meer <HI>puff of pedantry:</HI> for I found it truly in∣tricate; not only far surpassing my capacity, but astonishing to my Mind whereupon, I offered to return it again to the governor, desiring to be excused.</P>
<P>But he told me, he could not accept any excuse, for he was determined to have justice.</P>
<P>I asked him, how he could expect justice, where a tyrannical and invincible monster reigned.</P>
<P>But, with a fire in his countenance, which made my heart tremble, he replied, that altho' he had not power to withstand the ravenous destroyer, he had power to deal with his own subjects, who had re∣belled against him, in giving succour to, and form∣ing alliance with, such an enemy; and inasmuch as I was one, that did of right belong to his juris∣diction, but had been found in those treasonable practices, I might expect condign punishment, if I did not give a definitive answer to the question.</P>
<P>At this sentence I began to be seized with an uncommon horror; for I was aware that I was conversing with a person, not of a common cha∣racter;
<PB N="8" REF="009151_0009_10310C1FCA1D8210"/>
and tho' I could not form any just concep∣tion of his meaning, yet my heart smote me, upon the remembrance of some past transactions; so that I was convinced, it was something more than fiction; and I set myself to ponder the mat∣ters laid before me, with the utmost seriousness: but, in ruminating on this deep question, I found the more I attempted to find a solution, the more I was embarrassed; the more expedients I tried to discover the mystery, the more I began to despair of a possibility. My heart fainted, my flesh trem∣bled, and my countenance was turned to paleness; I was filled with a multitude of strange conjectures, all which turned to my confusion, but none to my relief. The sublimity, and tremedousness of the subject, over-powered my mind, so that I was obliged (for while) to quit the study, endeavour∣ing to relax, and compose my mind as well as I could, but the impression it had made upon me, prevented me from having much repose.</P>
<P>In this distress, I began to reflect on my former vanity, in imagining myself able to number the sand, to weigh the mountains, to sound the depth of the seas, and to measure the heavens; to describe the magnitudes, distances, and revolutions of the planets; and to solve the most abstruse problems, relating to terrestrial operations, or celestial signs; which was (now) an extreme mortification. But the most piercing, was the levity and contempt with which I first looked on the question before me; by which I found my understanding confounded, and my pride laid in the dust.</P>
<P>Bye and bye, I made another essay, to work out a solution, but finding myself at the greatest non∣plus, my mind began to be filled with resentment, and I complained of the governor's severity, to in∣sist on my performing a task impracticable.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="009151_0010_10310C24A462A2E0"/>Then the governor turning upon me, with lightening in his his eyes, challenged me to prove my charge against him: telling me, that tyranny was not in his nature, but justice was his <HI>element;</HI> and he would convince me, that his demand was just and reasonable; and, if I failed in the preformance, I had nothing to expect but death, by a most righ∣teous and unalterable determination.</P>
<P>Upon this I trembled and fell at his feet, con∣fessing the injustice of my complaint; intreating him to allow me time, promising the utmost ap∣plication. I also earnestly requested his assistance, for my better information into the nature of these things, hoping I should be able to satisfy his de∣mand.</P>
<P>But, concerning the time, he gave me no an∣swer at all; concerning the state of the question, he told me, the two last branches could never be solved, unless the two first were duly understood; notwithstanding, the solving of the former would not be of any benefit, unless the latter could be fully demonstrated; that, as to the first two parts, he was perfectly acquainted with them, in every punctilio; nor was it possible for any thing relating thereto, to escape his cognizance. And according to the best rules of calculation, he had stated the whole account, in the most accurate order, in his <HI>book of records,</HI> and <HI>tables of proportion;</HI> which, for my better information, I was at fully liberty to peruse. But as to the last two parts, (tho' it would be greatly to his honour and satisfaction, to have them solved) they were utterly beyond his line. He had never been able to penetrate into the least, branch thereof, or to discover whether a solution was possible, or not; nor could he give me the least assistance therein.</P>
<P>This answer was so pathetic and circumstantial, that, in deliberating thereon, it made my heart
<PB N="10" REF="009151_0011_10310C27D38A3E38"/>
faint, my blood chill, and all my bones to shiver. Howbeit, I pretended great submission to the go∣vernor, (for tho' I loved him not, I dreaded his resent∣ment) and feignedly set myself upon a very diligent search into all the rules he gave me; but I was pre∣possessed with such despairing thoughts, that I made very little proficiency; even in those things which were stated in a very intelligible light.</P>
<P>But a conceit came into my head, (which, for a while, yielded some relief to my imagination,) <HI>viz.</HI> that he was only a subordinate governor, with a limited power, and that his threatenings might exceed his authority, and that by appealing to superior authority I might find redress, so as to escape his severity, altho' I did not answer his de∣mand; whereupon, I began to make such enqui∣ries as these, concerning him: <HI>viz.</HI> Who is this governor? Whence did he receive his authority? How far doth his power extend? <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To which I was answered, that he was the king's vice-gerent, once of his houshold, and inseparable from his fa∣mily; that he had full power of life and death, and from him there was <HI>no appeal.</HI></P>
<P>Then the governor, with all the serenity of a judge, and with such majesty as seemed to spread death thro' all my powers, told me, I should know his authority; then calling for his secretary, I felt a shock like that of an earthquake; and imme∣diately the door of a certain apartment was burst open, from whence a certain person sprang forth and made obeisance to his highness, who familiarly received him. This person was my domestick companion, whom I had formerly treated with much insolence, using him as a slave to bear my burdens: and when he protested against my pro∣ceedings, I would not suffer him to speak, but often attempted to strangle him; and, at last, found means to confine him in a dark vault, having
<PB N="11" REF="009151_0012_10310C295C112A58"/>
fastened the door with bars of iron. It is not to be expressed, nor scarcely to be conceived, how surprising this shock was! But much more so, when I observed how his mien was altered, and perceived that he was the governor's secretary.—Then he bid him produce his accounts, and he laid open a train of accusations against me, conceived in terms so strong, and delivered in expressions so emphatical, that it was like so many arrows of fire piercing my heart. Likewise, the burden which I formerly obliged him to bear, he now fixed unmoveable upon me, which I found an in∣supportable weight; I trembled under it, and was not able to stand, and to remove it I found impossible. — The governor also called his execu∣tioner, who took and bound me with chains, beat me with many stripes, and cast me into a horrible dungeon: during these proceedings, I cried for mercy, but in vain; for the governor assured me, that as his authority did not admit of any appeal, so neither did his severity admit of any <HI>mitigation:</HI> therefore, I was committed to the vigilant inspec∣tion of the secretary, and the unrelenting rigour of the executioner; confined in a dark prison, bound in strong chains, and crushed under the weight of an insupportable burden, which did not admit me to move any way, to get a little ease. And if I made any complaint, the secretary, would silence me, by reminding me of my former con∣duct; upbraiding me in the most piercing manner, and galling me with such grinding accusations, as even to tear my heart to pieces: and then I was sure to feel most dreadful lashes from the execu∣tioner, so stinging as none can describe, but those that have felt his stripes.</P>
<P>In this deplorable condition I sustained a variety of inexpressible tortures; sometimes wrecked with anxious thoughts concerning the question proposed,
<PB N="12" REF="009151_0013_10310C2C8C87E6A8"/>
debating in my mind whether there was any hope, or possibility of finding an answer, thereby to ob∣tain my liberty; sometimes sinking down in di∣stress, weariness, and despair; sometimes swelling with rancour against the governor, and sometimes restlessly desiring to abandon my mind to an in∣sensibility, thereby to forget my wretchedness: but the most distracting thought, was an appre∣hension of the governor's return, to call me before him, concerning which I was in perpetual suspence, as I could not obtain the least hint of certainty re∣lating to the time; nor had I any room to expect any further respite; but that the indictment exhi∣bited against me by the secretary being fully proved in open court, I should receive the sentence of the governor, be cut asunder by the executioner, and my carcass cast out to be devoured by the monster; for that is the <HI>law of the country.</HI></P>
<P>In these circumstances I continued, till my spirit was exhausted with anguish and distraction, and my heart was hardened through vexation and hor∣ror: and I began to conceive hopes of obtaining relief by the assistance of the monster, inasmuch as the governor had not power to destroy him. And as I had formerly been strongly attached to his in∣terest, and had never violated my allegiance to him, he was ready to give me all the aid in his power; but it was thought expedient to be done without noise; therefore he sent me his apothecary with some mollifying ointments, hoping thereby to enable me to slip my chains. And by these I found some present ease, so that I began to fancy I should outwit my keepers, and creep away; but, after all endeavours, I found my chains <HI>inextricable.</HI></P>
<P>Thus disappointed, he sent me a cunning pick∣lock, with some instruments very artfully con∣trived, to loose my chains; when I saw the sub∣tilties of these inventions, I thought the right ex∣pedient
<PB N="13" REF="009151_0014_10310C316FE66F98"/>
was found imagining the device sufficient to unravel the most intricate gordian knot; but, upon trial, I found my expectations disappointed, for my chains were cemented <HI>beyond the reach of art.</HI></P>
<P>Then I began to be in deep despair, but my master encouraged me once more to try another stratagem; so he prepared me an anvil, and chose some of his own servants (who appeared best qua∣lified for such an enterprise) to attend me in dis∣guise, as often as possible, with files, and some∣times with hammers, or other instruments, as op∣portunity should serve, hoping to wear off my chains in time: but all means were ineffectual, for my chains proved <HI>infrangible.</HI> Neither could this work be done so silently, as to escape the vigilant observation of the secretary, whose accusations were like the stinging of an adder, and his rebukes like the biting of a serpent: and whensoever I awaked his resentment, he awaked the executioner, whose strokes were like the torments of a scorpion.</P>
<P>At last, finding all stratagems vain, and being quite tired out with pains and disappointments, I began to grow desperate; and the monster, flaming with malice against the governor, hoping (by open force) to vanquish my keepers, break the prison, and carry me away in triumph, resolved to appear in person, with all his might; which he did, and approached in the most formidable manner, and proceeded to the attack with the utmost fury, and with great success; for the cast up such banks that the secretary was buried under them, and made such a terrible fire, that I imagined the foundations of the prison gave way, and the smoak darkened the air, so that the executioner was obscured from my sight, and I thought he had been fled: I also fancied my chains had been broken, and was ready to shout for victory. But on a sudden the governor
<PB N="14" REF="009151_0015_10310C34E33127C0"/>
appeared with a glittering sword in his hand, and with a voice like thunder, called the secretary, who straight arose out of the rubbish, and the ex∣ecutioner appearing close by me, struck me such a blow, as made me lie like one dead, expecting instantaneous destruction: then the monster ap∣pearing disconcerted, marched off; but I remained in the most invincible fetters, under the most pun∣gent torture, encompassed with the most amazing horrors.</P>
<P>I now gave up all hope; all thoughts of finding an answer to the governor's question ceased, and all expectation of deliverance vanished; nothing but apprehensions of inevitable ruin possessed my breast. But, after some time, my old master pro∣posed another expedient for my relief, by sending his orator, in disguise, as an ambassador, to in∣treat, or negotiate with the governor, for my de∣liverance. This orator interceded for me like an accomplished rhetorician, with all the alluring terms of sophistry, with many specious promises and proposals to make, or comply with any con∣ditions that should be required; and delivered himself with so much eloquence, good temper, and pompous appearance, as seemed to attract the attention of the secretary; and I fancied he began to look favourable upon me, which I took for an indication, that the governor inclined to accept of terms. I likewise imagined, that the executioner began to treat me with more gentleness, which I conceived must proceed from some milder orders from the governor. Thus I sunk into a fond dream; for being brought so low by the fatigues I had suffered, a little relaxation easily composed me to sleep: but upon my awaking, I heard the governor reply to the ambassador, that all propo∣sals were vain; for justice was his province, and he should for ever be found inexorable. But this
<PB N="15" REF="009151_0016_10310C367827EE48"/>
ambassador (with all elegance of stile, and softness of address) continuing to urge for further audience; the governor stepping to him, plucked off his gar∣ment, whereby his nakedness was discovered, and he appeared such an ugly deformed creature, as fully betrayed him to be a limb of the monster: when finding himself exposed, he sculked behind a thicket, like a dog that had done some mischief.</P>
<P>Upon this sight I fainted away, being fully con∣vinced of the <HI>justice, penetration</HI> and <HI>inflexibility</HI> of the governor; knowing, that to escape from him is impracticable, and to answer his demand is, to me, impossible; and unless some deliverer, or deliverance, should appear, which to me is yet unknown, I have no resource left, but am in∣evitably bound over to destruction; inextricable bondage, exquisite pains, and insupportable terrors, are now my fixed portion, where I lie <HI>comfortless, friendless, helpless,</HI> and <HI>hopeless.</HI></P>
<P>Now, my confinement was more severe than ever; I was deprived of all liberty or power to act or move, only to gnash my teeth, gnaw my tongue, and torture my own mind: I saw nothing but darkness and dismal spectres; I heard nothing but roarings, thunders, and doleful groans; I felt nothing but chains, bars, sickness, and pain; I smelled nothing but stench and nauseousness; I tasted nothing but gall and wormwood: in this condition, without relaxation, I languished many days, perpetually expecting my final execution. At last I was alarmed with something, which I apprehended like musick, at a great distance, which attracted my attention, and awaked some sensation of pleasure; though I could not under∣stand the sound distinctly; but as I listened to hear it, it seemed to draw nearer, and I plainly perceived it was the sound of a trumpet. The meaning of it I could not conceive, but I found
<PB N="16" REF="009151_0017_10310C39AEB32B70"/>
the nearer it approached, the more my passion was excited into an ardent desire to know whence it came, and what it might portend. While my soul was thus alert in attending, the found conti∣nued advancing, and raising some faint joy in my heart, rather from the sweetness of the melody, than any reason I could render for my taking com∣fort; until it approached so near, that I heard three blasts distinctly sounded, and in the sounds I heard these words pronounced, GOOD-WILL, PEACE, PARDON: these words seemed to give some reviving to my soul, I lifted up myself to hearken if any thing further would be expressed; when the trumpet seeming still nearer, I heard three blasts more, pronouncing these words, LOVE, WISDOM, POWER. Upon this I found a sweetness of joy seize my heart, though I understood not the meaning, but still gladly attended to hear the sound repeated: bye-and-bye I heard the trumpet exceeding loud, as it were, just before the prison-gate, sounding three alarms expressing these words, REDEMPTION, RECONCILIATION, SALVATION.</P>
<P>These words came with so much power, that they spread new life through all my faculties; I felt the foundation of the prison shake, and a win∣dow (which before was close shut up) burst open, whereby light shined into the prison; for I per∣ceived a strong wind joined with the voice, which made way wherever it touched, though I knew not whence it came, nor whither it went; but by this means I enjoyed some light, and found opportu∣nity to look about, to see whence the joyful sound proceeded; and seeing a man standing before the gate, with a banner displayed in one hand, and a trumpet in the other; I asked him who he was, and what his design?</P>
<P>He told me, he was the king's messenger, sent to proclaim good tidings.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="009151_0018_10310C4042802EB8"/>I asked, What king?</P>
<P>He answered, King SHILOH,</P>
<P>I did not know any king of that name; there∣fore I desired to be informed who he was, of what line or family, in what realm was his dominion.</P>
<P>He told me, that he was the only son of the uni∣versal sovereign; a prince of such excellent dignity and merit, that he was made lord-chancellor in his father's court, and intrusted with the direction of all the affairs of the empire; and his mother being a native of that (once happy, though now mi∣serable) country, he had a natural indubitable right to the sovereignty of the realm; which, since the other prince had lost, and the governor was not able to recover, his father had appointed him, to take into <HI>his own hand.</HI></P>
<P>Then I enquired what good news he brought?</P>
<P>He answered, healing to the broken hearted, liberty to the captives, opening of the prison to those that are bound, relief to them that are ready to perish, comfort to all that mourn, and to pro∣claim the joyful year.</P>
<P>The balsamick influence which these words had upon my soul none can know, but such as have been in the like condition, and favoured with some∣thing of the like kind!</P>
<P>I asked him, if he had authority to perform such great things?</P>
<P>He answered, that he was the king's herald sent to publish the glad tidings of his good pleasure, in those places where his majesty designed himself to come, in whose hand alone the power was re∣served.</P>
<P>I asked, if the king was come that way?</P>
<P>He told me, it was the king's delightful em∣ploy, to visit the most desolate places, to seek out such as were in distress, and to deliver them; and for that purpose had sent his royal proclamation,
<PB N="18" REF="009151_0019_10310C41CB4D18D0"/>
that every poor wretched prisoner that should hear the news, and wait for his salvation, might be de∣livered from all bondage or misery whatsoever.</P>
<P>Then I asked, if the king did not insist on some conditions, to be performed by the persons to whom he would grant such favours? for I knew it was not in my power to do any thing, but must perish.</P>
<P>But the messenger told me, the redemption was <HI>free</HI> to such as have no power, wisdom, riches, or any thing to recommend them; it being beneath the honour of his majesty to make terms with poor miserable slaves, but to deliver them freely, of his own royal beneficence.</P>
<P>I further enquired, if his royal bounty was not confined to some particular favourites, so as that many may wait for it and not be disappointed?</P>
<P>He replied, that such blessings as the king be∣stowed might well be esteemed <HI>peculiar favours;</HI> but that none was ever rejected who gladly accepted his bounty: and if there were any who were not favoured with it, they were such (only) as did not seek it. But that it was reasonable to suppose, his majesty's wisdom would bestow his favours where they would be received with gratitude, and upon such persons whose circumstances rendered the be∣nefit necessary and acceptable; as gifts, not to the rich, but to the poor; deliverance, not to persons at liberty, but to those that were bound; healing, not to the whole, but the sick; provisions, not to the full, but to the hungry; and there was no other restriction in the king's bounty. That is, though it is not given to such as never saw their need, and consequently do not desire, but despise it; it is richly extended to every one, who (through his majesty's goodness) is made willing to wait for, and thankfully receive, such bounty; so that none ever was denied, who earnestly desired the blessing.</P>
<P>—Therefore, as no person ever had reason to com∣plain
<PB N="19" REF="009151_0020_10310C43A0609EB8"/>
of <HI>injustice</HI> in the governor; neither had any person the least reason to complain of the <HI>want of generosity</HI> in the king.</P>
<P>I gave audience to this word with all my exter∣nal and internal powers; and as I found the words, I eat them; for they were as cold water to a thirsty soul: but when I heard mention made of the go∣vernor, I made a pause, and asked him, if there was any intimacy between the governor and the king his master?</P>
<P>He told me, there was an inviolable friendship between them inasmuch as that the one never did any thing in opposition to the other. But the king ratified all the acts of the governor, and the go∣vernor approved all the edicts of the king.</P>
<P>I replied, how then can the king set any one at liberty from his bondage?</P>
<P>The herald answered tho' the king is an invin∣cible warrior against his enemies, he never uses hostilities against the governor of this country; but all things are done by means so amicable, as to issue in their mutual honour and satisfaction.</P>
<P>I then enquired whether the king had so much influence, or interest in the governor, to bring his inexorable disposition to become flexible? or had the governor a right to resign his commission into his majesty's hand during his stay.</P>
<P>He replied, that the governor's authority was <HI>perpetual;</HI> nor would the king ever offer him such an indignity as to recall his commission for a <HI>mo∣ment;</HI> neither would he ever attempt to obtain the least mitigation of justice from his hand, which would be a dishonour to the king himself, since all the rules and decrees of the governor are according to the king's own heart; and whatsoever is done by either of them, is for the reciprocal honour of them both.</P>
<P>I asked him, how this could be, and yet that
<PB N="20" REF="009151_0021_10310C4529DE1420"/>
the king should deliver a condemned wretch out of such a deplorable condition as mine was?</P>
<P>He answered, by making ample satisfaction to all, and every individual, of the governor's de∣mands; so as that the governor himself should ac∣quit, and honourably discharge, the criminal from all his offences, and fully cancel every indictment exhibited against him, and at the same time secure his own prerogitive, his honour, and his justice, <HI>inviolate.</HI></P>
<P>In this declaration I apprehended such a beauty, that it was like the most salutary cordial to me; and I began to enquire when the king would ar∣rive?</P>
<P>He answered, that the precise time was in his majesty's own breast; but that he was well ac∣quainted with my condition, and never made any delay in time of necessity, or ever suffered any one to perish that waited for his salvation.</P>
<P>I told him my case was so desperate, that if I had not speedy relief, I could not live.</P>
<P>He encouraged me not to fear, but wait for the arrival of his majesty, who perhaps, might be nearer than I conceived; and, probably, I might observe something to my consolation, if I pleased to take a deliberate view through a perspective, which he presented to me.</P>
<P>With eager joy, and intense application, I en∣deavoured to look, according to his direction. I found the telescope exceeding clear, and curiously fixed; and though it was too extensive for my hand to guide, it was directed to my eye with sur∣prizing exactness, by an invisible hand, (which af∣terwards was matter of much contemplation and admiration, though at the time it almost escaped my observation through the amazing prospect which saluted my eyes, and the delightful enter∣tainment I found therein;) and, upon a very de∣lectable
<PB N="21" REF="009151_0022_10310C4D63652840"/>
mountain I saw a person of a most splen∣ded appearance and exquisite beauty: such a sight my eyes never beheld before; nor is it possible for any to describe it, except such as can speak with <HI>new tongues;</HI> and such a transport of joy was raised in my soul as I never felt before; nor is it possible for any to feel the same, but those that have seen the same sight! and such a flame of love arose in my breast towards the person, as I had never felt; nor can any soul feel the same love, unless it be to the same <HI>object.</HI></P>
<P>When I had beheld this sight, and feasted my eyes and all my passions, with the effulgent glories and inestable beauties of this shining one, and had considered the amity between the governor and this glorious prince, all my old enmity against the governor vanished away: for as the flame of love kindled more and more in my heart towards the king of glory, it also produced sincere regard, and high veneration towards the governor. I thought of him with delight, and fully convinced, that all was equal just, and good, that he had done to me; yea, I was satisfied, that if was to die by his hand I must justify him and love him; for I could not <HI>desire</HI> to live at the <HI>expence of his glory.</HI></P>
<P>Then I laid before the messenger all my case, how I had been embarrassed with that intricate four-fold question, and the misery which had en∣sued; increating the best advice in my present cir∣cumstance.</P>
<P>To which he replied, that as to the two last parts of the problem, none in heaven or earth could touch upon them, save that king of glory. But respecting the first parts, the governor had rules to illustrate them, which I might have had opportunity to have seen already; though none were able to form such just conceptions of those rules, or understand them in a such a perspicuous
<PB N="22" REF="009151_0023_10310C4F3AAEA8C8"/>
light, as those who had their intellectuals enlarged, through acquaintance with the glorious prince.</P>
<P>I told him I had seen those rules, and wearied myself with poring on them, but could make very little of them, only what quite puzzled my under∣standing.</P>
<P>He told me, that it was my <HI>enmity to the governor</HI> that prevented success in my searches; but that he could appeal to myself if I did not find much pride, enmity, murmuring, and reluctance, and that I wanted a good-will in my enquities.</P>
<P>I confessed, what he said was true, but that I now found a real <HI>change in my disposition.</HI></P>
<P>He told me, that since I found my mind well affected to the governor, the study of his records would become pleasant; and that while I waited for the king's approach, it would be necessary for me to inform myself the best I could, in those things wherein I had opportunity to be instructed; for the more I was acquainted with those two first branches, the better I might understand, and with more pleasure take in, the solution of the other parts, whensoever it should be the king's pleasure to favour me with it.</P>
<P>I was fully persuaded of the seasonableness of this advice, and I set myself (in earnest) to examine the rules given me by the governor; and when I began to attend to it with affection, approbation, and chearfulness, I found the paradoxes open, with an <HI>intelligible consistency,</HI> through the whole system.</P>
<P>But when I entered into a close perusal of these records, and began to form just conceptions of the things therein contained, to view them in a true light, and deliberate thereon with understanding; I found it not only the deepest study, but attended with the most <HI>awful considerations,</HI> that ever my thoughts had been employed in. All the anguish and terror which had distressed me heretofore, did
<PB N="23" REF="009151_0024_10310C50CAA94B38"/>
scarce bear any comparison with the tremendous aspect now before me; the hideousness of the mon∣ster! the devastation made by him! the majesty and justice of the governor! and the inexpressible misery of my own condition! appeared so amaz∣ing as no heart can conceive, save those who have had a distinct view of these things: and had it not been for the comfort I had received from the king's messenger, the light which was opened into my dark situation, and the prospect I had of the king's person, it had been impossible for me to have survived, without falling into distraction or desperation.—And frequently, when my very soul was overwhelmed with deep enquiries and shocking discoveries, I should be roused up by the melodious sound of the trumpet, which would transport my mind, and relieve my weary spirits: for the herald continued often to pass that way, with whom I had frequent conferences concerning the king, his person, grace, glory and expected approach. And sometimes I had the prospect of his beauties and excellencies repeated to me, which afforded comfortable meditations in my weary hours. Thus I was refreshed and supported, while searching into the profound <HI>rules of justice,</HI> and dark <HI>abyss of misery.</HI></P>
<P>I found the questions and solutions stated with the utmost accuracy and coherence, but so deep and extensive, that all my powers were absorbed in the discoveries; for my faculties had never been ex∣panded to a capacity for receiving things so <HI>sublime.</HI> And I was convinced, that the most profound pro∣blems I had ever exercised myself upon were mere childish toys, in comparison of this: yet, by dili∣gent application I arrived at a considerable degree of distinct understanding, both in the description of the monster, and the effects of his outrages: but a perfect knowledge I could not obtain; for I
<PB N="24" REF="009151_0025_10310C525672A888"/>
continually found, the more discoveries I made, the more <HI>profound</HI> and <HI>unsearchable</HI> the mystery ap∣peared.</P>
<P>In this condition I continued for a season, some∣times close engaged in this necessary study, and sometimes seized with fear, and crushed down with dark apprehensions: for tho' I had received much comfort. I was still in bondages, and I began to think the time very long, insomuch, that I was of∣ten ready to give up all hope. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the manifest tokens of <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which I would not forget, yet, I was frequently much <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with suspicion of its being a deception especially, when my mind was fatigued, and my <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> low; or when I had continued some <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> re∣petition of my former comforts; than I should be ready to draw the most uncomfortable conclusions; for my mind was too weak, to retain the satisfac∣tion which I received at one time, so as to be a support to me at another.—At some seasons, all my fears would be dissipated, and my mind ele∣vated with great joy; both upon the remembrance of the first joyful discoveries, fresh soundings of the trumpet, and fresh views of the king's majesty. And as the sound grew more clear, and the pro∣spect still more distinct and glorious, I judged the king was making some nearer advances; so that my joy would be unspeakable, until some dusky cloud would overspread my mind, and cast a gloom upon all my conceptions; or, some fresh discovery of the monster's horrible aspects, would arise before me; which would chill my very heart, and strike a piercing shock through all my powers Thus my soul would be filled with fears, doubts, and questionings; but when I could enjoy a fresh ma∣nifestation of the king's beauty, grace, and near approach, all my fears would vanish away.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="009151_0026_10310C5A860BCE48"/>The reason of these waverings and hesitations, I conceive to proceed, both from the weakness of my judgment, and the instability, or imbecility of my inward powers.—As to the former, the discove∣ries I had of the king, and his designs, carried such demonstration of love, mercy, faithfulness, and sufficiency, that there was not the least to distrust the accomplishment of all that the herald declared; but the darkness, and contractedness of my understanding, prevented me from forming clear and distinct conceptions, or digesting those things in due order. —As to the latter, my mind was so weak, that when I was favoured with those manifestations, I found myself filled with such exstatick joy, that at these seasons, I had not the least suspicion of a delusion: therefore, I did not employ my understanding, (as I ought to have done) in scrutinizing into the nature of what I heard and saw; whereby, I might have been better esta∣blished; but taking all for undeniable fact, (nor apprehending any need of close enquiry, concern∣ing the reality, or fictitiousness thereof) while I found myself in the enjoyment; I should find my∣self quite at a loss at other times, when those en∣joyments were withdrawn: and some horri∣ble appearance presented itself; and I was fainting with weariness and impatience; I was not able to form any just conceptions, nor make any proper reflections upon those things which had formerly given me comfort, but were not present before my eyes. For then I should be filled with a mul∣titude of thoughts, of the possibility, and probabi∣lity of a deception; and of the miserable mistakes which many have fallen into, by taking fancies for realities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And I should fall into doubts and questionings, concerning the propriety, or ambi∣guity of the things which I had seen and heard; as, whether the blessing I had hoped for, were only
<PB N="26" REF="009151_0027_10310C5C10845138"/>
for others, and not for me; whether the good news brought by the herald, were to be confided in; whether my miserable state and earnest desire of deliverance, had not induced me to impose upon myself, by construing things in my own favour, contrary to their natural intentions; whether the real favours which I did enjoy, ever since the light was opened into my apartment, were granted by the king's order, as a preparative to my full deli∣verance, or only a relaxaction granted by the goaler, before my final sentence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And amidst these mutual debates, all my faculties would be so in∣veloped, that I could not come to any fixed deter∣mination, nor reason conclusively upon any thing, relating to my present circumstances; nay, some∣times my spirits would be so far exhausted, that I was ready to doubt, whether all that I had seen and heard, from whence I had conceived hope or comfort, was any more than a fond dream.—Thus for want of clearness in judgment, and forti∣tude in mind, I should be in the greatest suspence, even, after receiving the fullest demonstrations, and after enjoying the richest consolations.</P>
<P>But, in all my doubts and waverings, I never wavered in this one thing, that if ever I must find relief, it must be by the <HI>king alone;</HI> and that there was no possibility of help in any other. Therefore, whether my hope was stronger or weaker, or my comfort more or less, it was only according to the encouragement I received, or the discourage∣ment I formed to myself, concerning his majesty's sufficiency, good-will, near approach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> For I neither expected, sought, nor desired deliverance from any other. Yea, I found such a flame of love, and soul so powerfully drawn towards him, that I should sooner have chose to perish at his feet, than that any other should claim the glory of my deliverance; and in my most joyful hours,
<PB N="27" REF="009151_0028_10310C5DDA7AD2E8"/>
the height of my ambition, was to wait on his majesty all the days of my life; for I thought, if I was at full liberty, and must not enjoy the fa∣vour to attend on the king, it would be as great a distress to me, as any thing I ever underwent, for he had truly conquered my heart with his love; and if I did not enjoy comfort and satisfaction in him, I enjoyed it no where at all: for though my spirits would sometimes grow flat, and exceeding low, thro' drowsiness, weariness, and discourage∣ment; whensoever I received any fresh consolation, it was from him alone: and whensoever I enjoyed any good degree of vivacity, I still found my mind intensely fixed upon the glorious prince, waiting for the happy hour of his arrival, to see his beauty, and enjoy his salvation.</P>
<P>At last the trumpet sounded exceeding loud and distinct, as it had been talking to the intellectual powers of my soul; and light shined around me exceeding clear; as it had been the beams of the sun in the meredian altitude; my soul became ex∣ceeding alert, all my faculties were expanded, and all my passions took fire! and I saw the king him∣self approaching the prison-gate.—The appearance was superlatively glorious, that I melted away, and there remained no spirit in me: I was not able to sustain such a conjunction of joy and glory, and I fell at his feet as dead. But he laid his right-hand upon me, and said, <HI>I am the first and the last.—I have the key of</HI> David, <HI>I open and no man shutteth, I shut and no man openeth.—I say to the pri∣soners, go forth; to them that are in darkness, shew yourselves.</HI></P>
<P>Then I was strengthened and arose and stood upon my feet, but I was not able to behold his glory; for his beauty, and the majesty of his coun∣tenance were so overcoming, that I was obliged to turn away my eyes.—But there was a person along
<PB N="28" REF="009151_0029_10310C5F636CD518"/>
with him, (whom for quality, was equal with his majesty, but not clothed in the same garments,) whose office is, to attend the king in all his enter∣prizes; to attest and seal all his edicts, to dispense all his royal bounties, to illustrate the glory of his majesty, and his kingdom, and to interpret all mysteries belonging to the state; whose dignity and authority, I cannot find words to express: but, be∣cause all the counsels of the court, all the circum∣stances of the subject, and all transactions in the state, came under his recognizance; I shall call him the <HI>king's secretary.</HI> This is the person who di∣rected the king's trumpet to my dismal cell, and di∣rected my eyes to take a prospect of his majesty; with many other kind offices, which I have been fa∣voured with, tho' I know not whence they came. He now anointed my eyes and my ears, and gave me a strengthening cordial; whereby my eyes were enabled to <HI>behold the king in his beauty,</HI> my ears to hear tremendous voices, and my heart to meditate terror. And, I lift up my face and looked sted∣fastly upon the king.</P>
<P>Then the king asked, what was my request?</P>
<P>I answered, that it might please his majesty, to consider my condition, and deliver me from my bondage.</P>
<P>He asked me, whether I understood my own condition?</P>
<P>Then I laid before him my distress, as far as I was capable of describing it, and told him I had no expectation from any, but himself; being sen∣sible, that I must either be saved by his goodness, or inevitably perish. And, therefore, I earnestly implored his compassion, in case he did not find my condition too hopeless to admit of relief; but, if that should be the case, I was willing to die at his feet.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="009151_0030_10310C679670A4E8"/>To which he replied, <HI>Is there any thing too hard for me?</HI></P>
<P>From this word I took courage, drew near, and took hold of his girdle; and falling down at his feet, besought him, to get himself honour in my deliverance.</P>
<P>Then he asked me, which way I expected to be set at liberty?</P>
<P>I told him, I was very sensible of the justice of my confinement, and the direful sentence past up∣on me, and did not desire liberty upon any other terms, but what might be to the honour of the go∣vernor, and of his majesty; but that I was in∣formed by his own messenger, that he undertook to satisfy all the demands of the governor, on be∣half of such helpless wretches as I was.</P>
<P>He asked, what were those demands, which his excellency the governor made upon me?</P>
<P>Upon this, I produced all the accounts which I had gathered from the tables and records laid before me.</P>
<P>Then the king's herald told me, my calcula∣tions were very just in many particulars, but in many things deficient. That it was well for me to have a competent understanding in those things, that I might know the necessity, the nature, and the greatness of the king'salvation; but, that it was not sufficient, that his majesty should answer the question according to my accompts; but ac∣cording to the governor's perfect description, which was already compleatly done betwixt the king and the governor, and therefore the king had a right to demand my liberty when he pleased. And that as I had been embarrassed with those hard questions, and had borne the distress of seeing my own cala∣mity; it was his majesty's will, that I should enjoy the pleasure of beholding the whole transaction, wherein all things had been adjusted between the
<PB N="30" REF="009151_0031_10310C6968B36F00"/>
king and the governor; and that I might peruse all his majesty's solutions to my full contentment, and ample satisfaction.</P>
<P>I heard these words with earnest attention, and drank them in with eagerness; and being strength∣ened by what the king's secretary had done to me, I was able to understand in a distinct light, and ruminate upon what was spoken with such sere∣nity of mind, as I never felt before; and it was attended with such attactive power, as if my very soul had gone out of myself, into the bosom of the king; or, as if I had ceased to be, and I had found myself become a member of his body; or, as if my life had expired, and I had been inspired with new life from his breath. Therefore, I fur∣ther enquired, if there were any hopes that I might enjoy such a blessing, when set at liberty, as to dwell in his dominion, or become one of his atten∣dants; for to be wholly denied in this, I thought would be a grief equal to my present confine∣ment.</P>
<P>He told me, all that the king redeemed were his own property, and he would take care to have them duly qualified for, and securely fixed in the station for which he designed them; which was to attend his person and continue his domesticks for ever.</P>
<P>This declaration was adequate to my ultimate wishes and spread tranquility thro' my faculties; and I found my soul filled with such composure, satisfaction, and delight in the king, as if every thing in the universe had been dead but himself; or as if every excellency in the creation had disap∣peared, and all their glories centered in him alone. Then I had such a view of the beauties, and per∣fections of his majesty, as my eyes had never seen; for tho' the former discoveries were transcendently striking and glorious, so as to raise the highest rap∣tures
<PB N="31" REF="009151_0032_10310C6AF3608AC8"/>
in my soul, yet I was too weak to view his glory in a distinct light; but now I had strength to make deliberate observations, and form just con∣ceptions of what my eyes beheld; but the perfec∣tion of his person, the light of his countenance, the lustre of his garments, the splendor of his throne, the glory of his crown, the rectitude of his sceptre, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> were such, as nothing but the new strength I had received could have enabled me to behold; nor shall I ever be able fully to de∣scribe them.</P>
<P>After my eyes were feasted, and my soul sa∣tiated with this incomparable vision, the king took a key in his hand, which the herald very amply described to me; and the secretary directed my eyes to behold the curious make of it, that I might understand the form and powers thereof. And with this key he opened every lock belonging to the prison, and to my chains; and did it in such an open, deliberate manner, as gave me opportu∣nity to observe by what power he removed every bar, disengaged every ward, and turned every spring. Thus I was brought out of prison, set at full liberty, and found myself made free indeed. I now rejoiced with joy unspeakable and full of glory to see my long expected deliverance con∣summate in such a perfect, undeniable manner: I can scarcely say, whether I was more delighted with my ever memorable, and unspeakably happy <HI>deliverance,</HI> or with the mysterious excellency of his majesty's <HI>performance.</HI> But I confess, that till this time, I had never so clearly understood, as now I did, how inexplicable the depth and nature of my misery, and how absolutely inextricable my bondage were, to any but him that understood all mysteries, and possessed invicible power; for an operation so <HI>masterly</HI> and <HI>curious</HI> I had never seen before.</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="009151_0033_10310C716F0C53A8"/>Then the herald informed me, it was the king's pleasure that I should have a satisfactory demonstra∣tion, how compleat and honourable my deliverance was; and therefore, I should be admitted to take a deliberate view of the transactions relative to my acquittance, and the <HI>decisive stroke</HI> whereby all the demands of the governor were undeniably satisfied by the king's majesty: whereupon he led me to a spacious plain where I saw the governor walk∣ing in a garment <HI>white as snow,</HI> and his secretary familiarly walking by his side; and when he came to a certain place, he put upon his white raiment a vesture of <HI>flaming scarlet,</HI> and called his executioner, who immediately came with a glittering sword in his hand. Thus he stood with a countenance full of terrible majesty, having his secretary on his right-hand, and his executioner on his left; and immediately I saw the king upon the distant mountains riding in a glorious chariot, <HI>swift as lightning;</HI> and when he came near, he alighted and made very low obeisance to the governor, but the governor did not move, or made any obeisance to the king. Then the king placed himself over against the governor, having his secretary on his right-hand, and his herald on his left; and here I had an opportunity to behold the majesty of <HI>two courts,</HI> disposed in the most regular order. So awful was the appearance! so grave the mien! it spread silence and had serenity through the whole plan; there was neither voice nor motion to be heard or seen, till the court was opened; nor during, the whole process did the wind blow, or a leaf shake; but all the elements appeared in a <HI>total stagnation.</HI> So I saw, and heard the whole <HI>procedure.</HI></P>
<P>The governor first sounded a trumpet exceeding loud, which made the earth tremble; then he pro∣claimed his great authority, the extensiveness of his commission, and the justice of his govern∣ment,

which the king acknowledged by a very low bow, and all the king's court made their pro∣per signals of respect; and audience was given while he distinctly opened the two first branches of the question, and gave a very accurate description of the monster in all his unbounded enormities; and an ample definition of the mischief done, and damage sustained, by him; with a just representa∣tion of the heinous and aggravated crimes of those who had entered into alliance with such an enemy. When he spake of these things, his voice was like thunder, his breath was flames of fire, and a cloud of smoke darkened the air round about him; from his breath, the executioner's sword took fire, and burnt with a vehement flame; and when he had ended every paragraph, his secretary attested the truth thereof, and signed it with a <HI>pen of brass;</HI> then his executioner brandished his flaming sword over the whole plain.—And all the king's court kept silence, and gave audience, till the governor had finished all his declarations.—And when he had made an end, having demonstrated every thing in a distinct and obvious light, he again sounded a trumpet, and made proclamation; <Q>That if any one had any objection against the light in which these things were represented; or any reason to render, why vengeance should not be taken on all those rebellious subjects, who had committed treason against their rightful governor, and joined with the destroyer of their country, <HI>Let him draw near.</HI></Q>—But no answer was made.—Then he commanded his executioner to go forth and slay, without mercy or distinction, every creature that was found in rebellion, or had deserted his allegiance to his serene highness.—Then the exe∣cutioner rendezvoused a formidable host, mounted a pale horse, lifted up a black flag, and began his march, with all the ensigns and terrors of death;
<PB N="34" REF="009151_0035_10310C74C85DB940"/>
and his fiery sword shot darts of lightning <HI>through all the land.</HI></P>
<P>Upon this, the king's herald sounded his trumpet so loud, that it not only made the earth shake, but the heavens also, and proclaimed his majesty <HI>umpire.</HI> And there was profound silence.</P>
<P>Then his majesty spake, with a serene voice, to the governor, and bid him stay his hand; for he had undertaken to save those offenders, and they should be saved; and on them no vengeance should be taken.</P>
<P>The governor replied, that vengeance against rebels was <HI>inevitable.</HI></P>
<P>The king told him, he was not come to offer violence to his honour, nor intrench upon his autho∣rity, neither to intreat any favour, nor yet to abett, or excuse offences; but to be the representative of those miserable offenders; having engaged in their behalf, and made their case his own, he would stand in <HI>their place;</HI> therefore, whatsoever his highness found against them, lay it to his charge, impute all their transgressions to him, and deal with him as the <HI>very criminal;</HI> spare him not, but let all the deserved vengeance fall <HI>upon him.</HI></P>
<P>This declaration of his majesty, struck a total silence, and stagnation, through all the plain; there was neither voice nor motion; the heaven and the earth stood in astonishment, and amazement ap∣peared in every countenance, for about an hour; during which period, the two potentates stood unmoveable, having their eyes fixed upon one an∣other, without the least change of countenance in either.</P>
<P>Then the governor made a signal to the execu∣tioner to bend all his force against the <HI>king's person,</HI> which he accordingly did; whereupon all the king's guards, and attendants, opened to the right and left, leaving his majesty exposed; and the executioner
<PB N="35" REF="009151_0036_10310C77F777B118"/>
marched against him, with such tremendous fury, as I never beheld before, nor was ever the like seen under heaven. The sun closed his eyes, the world shook, the rocks burst asunder, and the whole frame of nature was distorted; and he came upon his majesty like a torrent, and (without ceremony, or resistance) pierced him <HI>through the heart,</HI> with his <HI>flaming sword.</HI></P>
<P>This was the most awful sight that my eyes ever saw; nor did I ever hear of any that had seen the like. The blood gushed out; his countenance turned to paleness; all his powers trembled; he fainted away, and resigned his life.—Thus fell the prince of perfect glory and merit; and the most valuable of all lives was taken away?</P>
<P>But what tongue can declare? What pen can describe? What heart can conceive? the effects of this stupendous stroke! the world was in astonish∣ment; the heavens stood amazed; celestial angels came down to behold the wonder; infernal angels felt the tremor, thro' all the coasts of hell; living men trembled, and became as dead; and dead men came out of their graves to see what was done! None can express the love, compassion, humility, patience, justice, goodness, veracity, fortitude, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which this meritorious prince manifested in this action! Nor can all the annals of time furnish us with an instance, worthy to be named in comparison with this!</P>
<P>By this surprizing sight my soul was absorbed, all my mental powers were exhausted, and there re∣mained no more spirit in me; I was fainting away; but the king's secretary sustained me; and, directing my eyes to behold this dreadful <HI>catastrophe,</HI> he gave me a distinct view of the most surpassing glorious and indelible trophy, arising from thence.</P>
<P>The blood that issued from the prince's wound, quenched the flame of the sword; and the execu∣tioner
<PB N="36" REF="009151_0037_10310C7B45C4EDC0"/>
(without any violence offered to him) expired upon the spot; the moment he struck his majesty the last stroke, all his army vanished away, all ap∣pearance of hostility ceased; and what remained was a most shocking aspect like unto a field of bat∣tle, where two armies had destroyed one another, 'till nothing remained alive. Thus all things con∣tinued in a total stagnation for a certain space; but quickly a troop of guards arrived from the palace, and placed themselves in order about their prince's dead body; and his secretary embraced him, and he revived, and appeared alive, in his full vigour.—This stupendous victory inspired all nature with exstatick joy; the heavens rejoiced; the morning stars sang together; the earth was full of gladness; the mountains dropped new wine; the trees clapped their hands; the flowers appeared all in bloom; the birds warbid all around; the sea roared with joyful murmurs; and shouts of triumph ran thro' all the host.—I was attentive to this unparalleled transac∣tion, till my soul was swallowed up in exstacy, and lost in wonder; I was transported into such raptures of joy, that it had almost overcome all my intel∣lectual powers, and elevated my mind into a stupe∣faction; but my comforting sustainer strengthened my heart with a vivifying cordial, whereby I was enabled to retain the use of my faculties; and my mind was much alert, to attend to the whole scene.—The king, seeing the executioner dead at his feet, asked the governor, if he had any more hosts to send forth; and he answered, no. He asked again, if he had any more vengeance, or any thing to lay to the charge of those persons whose cause the king had espoused; and the governor answered, no. Again he asked, if what had been done was sufficient satisfaction to his justice, and adequate to his honour; and he answered, yes.</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="009151_0038_10310C81C911EA28"/>Then the king and the governor saluted one another, with all the tokens of friendship; and all the nobles and attendants, in each court, kissed and embraced one another; there appeared such perfect amity, and every thing so harmonious, as far ex∣ceeded any thing I had ever seen; the two courts <HI>became one:</HI> the governor acknowledged the king's supremacy, gave him his right-hand, and the pre-eminence in all things, yet abated nothing of his own dignity; likewise the governor's secretary, and all his retinue (only his executioner who was dead) kept every one his proper station; and without compulsion or reluctance, were entirely subservient to his majesty's pleasure.—Now I saw the splendor of a <HI>king's court indeed!</HI> The majesty, the unani∣mity, the similarity, the regularity, and the har∣mony of this court! with the refulgent rays of glory, shining in the king's person, and reflecting lustre upon every face! did excel all the glorious appearances that ever my eyes beheld; nor had I ever heard, or read, of the like, or ever conceived in my heart, any thing equal to what I now saw!—For, tho' the glory proceeded from the king alone, yet it had such an extensive influence, that it poured an incomparable brilliancy upon all around him; every object took the reflection, and every face shone with peculiar beauty; and, among the rest, I found myself illucidated within and without: my vital parts were in a flame, illuminating my whole body; and my garments glittered like beams of light; my heart was abundantly enlarged, and the faculties of my soul strengthened, more than ever I had found them before; and I was inspired with such vivacity and agility, that I became as sprightly as a roe, or a young hart.—Here my soul regaled itself in unspeakable pleasure, bathed in fountains of inexpressible delight, and floated in the midst of an ocean of inconceivable joy; for the king's secre∣tary
<PB N="38" REF="009151_0039_10310C8353D60C78"/>
anointed my eyes to make my sight clear and strong; and directed me to behold such a variety of splendid objects, in such harmonious contexture, and exquisite order; all shining in the radiancy of the supreme <HI>origin of glory;</HI> until my soul was so expanded, that I scarcely knew whether I was on earth, or in heaven.</P>
<P>But when my soul was largely satiated with these extatic delights, and my mind returned to a settled composure, I still found incessant desires to hear the king's solution to the governor's propositions.</P>
<P>Then the king's herald sounded his trumpet so loud, that it echoed through all the celestial orbs: the mountains trembled and melted away; the val∣lies arose, and were exalted; springs dried up, and dry land flowed with waters; fruitful ground wi∣thered, and barren desarts appeared in bloom; the sea dried up, and the heavens opened; all the glory of man totally subsided; and there was profound silence.</P>
<P>And he proclaimed the glory of the king's ma∣jesty, the rectitude of his kingdom, his ample per∣fections, and his immense riches; whereby he is sufficient to subdue every enemy, to compleat every work he pleases to undertake, to bless all his subjects with every enjoyment which their hearts can desire, and to maintain their happy state for ever.</P>
<P>Then he distinctly answered to all the particulars, which were contained in the governor's question. He fully demonstrated the qualifications of his ma∣jesty to be far superior to all the formidable ap∣pearances of the hideous monster; sufficient to de∣stroy his reign, and extirpate his being; and also to make ample reparation of all the damage done by him; so as that the governor should neither suf∣fer loss or dishonour, nor his subjects suffer distress or disgrace, no more than if the monster had <HI>never been born.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="009151_0040_10310C85172C05A8"/>But in the opening of these things, there was such a display of wisdom, love, and power; such excellency, glory, and majesty; that it frequently exhilarated my soul into rapturous agitation; but the secretary stayed my passions, and would not suffer me to give way to too much extacy, because the importance, and sublimity of the subject, re∣quired the most <HI>fixed attention.</HI> So I was favoured with a full, distinct, and accurate manifestation, of that which had filled my mind with so much anxiety; and which I had so long, and so earnestly desired to see. But the comfort, satisfaction, en∣largedness, establishment, solid peace, and serenity of mind, which I enjoyed, in seeing and hearing the explication of those deep mysteries, did excell all that ever I had experienced before, or what I shall ever be <HI>able to describe.</HI></P>
<P>Now when the herald had spoken every particu∣lar paragraph, relating to the excellencies, or won∣derful performances of the king; his secretary at∣tested the truth thereof; inscribed it upon <HI>living tables,</HI> and sealed it with the king's <HI>immutable sig∣net.</HI> And when he had made an end, his majesty stood up, and made proclamation, that if any per∣son in heaven, or in earth, or under the earth, would contend with him, undertake to accuse him in any thing, or found any thing to object against his proceedings in any punctilio; <HI>let him draw near.</HI>—But no answer was made. Then the trum∣pet sounded, and all the harps answered in chorus; and the harmonious noise resounded through all the heavenly domes; triumphal acclamations ran thro' all the court; and all the kingdom was filled with shouts of joy; which made the earth and the hea∣vens ring: the royal standard was erected; and all the ensigns of majesty, victory, peace, and glory, were displayed; the mountains and forests broke forth into singing, the lower parts of the earth
<PB N="40" REF="009151_0041_10310C8B961DC228"/>
shouted; and the morning stars sang together; the light of the moon became as the light of the sun; and the light of the sun was seven-fold, as the light of seven days; and rays of stupendous glory shined through the whole creation.—Now my soul was absorbed with wonder; lost in admiration; I was obliged to give way to the overcoming rap∣ture, and indulge my exstatick passions; for I could not refrain from songs of gladness, shouts of joy, and all the demonstrations of delight, that my soul was able to express. And still, whenso∣ever I recollect the magnificence of this triumph, I cannot refrain being transported with pleasure, and crying out with unspeakable joy; HOW GLO∣RIOUS LOOKED THE KING OF ISRAEL THAT DAY!</P>
<P>Then the king called me unto him, and told me, he accepted me as his son; that he had pre∣pared all things necessary to give me a princely education; and as soon as I had attained to the due qualifications, he would take me to his royal palace; where I should abide in his presence for ever; and enjoy all the delights that my heart could desire. And in the mean time, I should have free access to him, in every thing that might be needful to call upon him for.—The king's secre∣tary told me, he would always continue present with me, to assist, instruct, and comfort me; to introduce me into the king's presence, and com∣municate to me his bounties; and to improve me in every thing that might be conducive to my feli∣city.—The king's herald assured me, he would be ready at all seasons, to inform me in all matters that could be necessary for my instruction relating to the king, his excellencies, his riches, his go∣vernment, the orders of his house, my relation to him, and interest in him.—Also the governor told me, he should no more exercise jurisdiction over
<PB N="41" REF="009151_0042_10310C8D1E614478"/>
me; but, as it would be for my benefit to receive his instructions, he would always attend me in quality of a counsellor; and I should always find an equal pleasure and profit in all his admonitions.—Also the governor's secretary told me, he should no more act toward me in the same character as he did before; since I now belonged to another prince; but seeing I still might be liable to many inconve∣niences, through my own instability, or want of presence of mind; to prevent which, his assistance might be very useful; he should continue my con∣stant companion, under the king's direction, in the capacity of a monitor.—Then all the king's guards, and nobles of the court, saluted me in the quality of a prince. And the herald further in∣formed me, that I was to remain at his majesty's country-seat, (with others of the king's children) where I should enjoy all accommodations fit for a prince; and might expect frequent visits from his majesty; having princes for my companions, and the royal guards for my attendants; till the king should come, and carry me in triumph, and state, to his royal city.</P>
<P>Then the king wrote me a discharge from all offences, past, present, and to come; with an ac∣quittance from all servitude, or allegiance, to any lord, or governor, but himself: he also bestowed on me an instrument of adoption; whereby he ac∣knowledged, and declared me to be his own son, and to have a right to all the enjoyments in his kingdom. And also promised me every necessary accommodation, during my stay at his lower house; and that he would be expeditious in returning to fetch me to himself, in his serene palace.—These things he signed, sealed, and delivered to me, in the presence of three faithful witnesses; assuring me they were enrolled in the council-chamber, by three infallible recorders.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="009151_0043_10310C8EA9983D38"/>And when his majesty had regularly stationed me in his inferior palace, and given proper directions for my education, and noble accomplishment; he mounted his triumphal chariot, and hasted with all his train, to the imperial city; where he was re∣ceived with all the demonstrations of joy, and tri∣umph; and where he reigns supreme <HI>King of kings, and Lord of lords;</HI> to whom every creature yields subjection, every knee bows, and every tongue ascribes praise and glory.</P>
<P>I find this country-palace is the king's acade∣my; where the royal sciences are taught; which are not to be learned in any school in the universe beside; nor can be taught by any but the king's instructors; who are his herald, and his secretary. For notwithstanding the governor and his secretary remain with us, and are of special use among us, in their own province (being well skilled in other sciences) they are entire strangers to the sciences peculiar to the palace. Nor can any man learn, or is it possible for them to be taught these things, so long as they dwell in any part of universe, save in the king's own country. All other climates are incompatible with these sciences; the air they breathe in, and the food they live upon, render them incapable of receiving the instructions; yea, the very nature, and complexion of the inhabitants of all other realms, are foreign, and indocible to any of these things.</P>
<P>The sciences taught in this school, and learned by all the royal princes, are chiefly four, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The nature, extensiveness, and perfection of his majesty's answers, to the governor's problems; for though we had heard them published, we were far from apprehending them in their fullest ex∣tent; they being of so sublime a nature, as require the closest application, and deepest penetration, to conceive of them in a <HI>distinct light.</HI> These are
<PB N="43" REF="009151_0044_10310C91DBE73428"/>
much deeper studies than the tables of the gover∣nor (notwithstanding the intricacy, and amazing depths thereof;) for the perfections, and perfor∣mances of the king, do far out-vie all descrip∣tions of the monster, and the mischief done by him; and do abound beyond all that ever was re∣quired, or mentioned by the governor: and not∣withstanding we have opportunity to peruse all the herald's curious descriptions, drawn in the most lively figures, and apt representations, as well as hearing his excellent lectures, upon the great qua∣lities, undertakings, performances, and victories, of his majesty; they so far transcend any thing that ever was presented to our eyes, or ears, or that ever our minds were exercised in before; that our capacities could never conceive of the dephs thereof, were it not that the king's secretary opens, interprets, and guides our understandings into these mysteries. He not only leads to the true chain, di∣recting us to compare one thing with another, so as to see the consistency, and perfection of the whole system; but also anoints our eyes and ears, with an <HI>unction peculiar to his excellency;</HI> and refreshes us with vivifying cordials, to keep our minds, and senses alert. Thus the study becomes delightful; both as it is most excellent in its own nature, and as our∣selves are so much interested therein: and we make a comfortable proficiency; notwithstanding the knowledge is unattainable by any creature that is not instructed the same way.</P>
<P N="2">2. To understand the foundation, constitution, oeconomy, and privileges of the kingdom; the re∣lation between the king and his subjects; the royal grant whereby they hold their title to all the rich blessings of the kingdom; with the glory and dig∣nity wherein they stand, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is study more sublime than the former. But as it bears some re∣lation
<PB N="44" REF="009151_0045_10310C985BDC4360"/>
to it, it becomes more easy, when the other is well understood; especially as they both depend upon the perfections of the king. And we have the same instructors, and the same advantages in this, as in the former branch; but the stupendous depths, and glories, that do herein appear, are suf∣ficient to astonish the most enlarged and most esta∣blished mind; nor is it possible for any one to form just conceptions thereof, without such <HI>preparations</HI> as we are favoured with, through the bounty of the secretary, our grand tutor.</P>
<P N="3">3. To learn the court-language. As this is the most elegant of all languages, so the study of it is most excellent and curious. It is a language which no person was ever able to learn, who lived under the governor's jurisdiction, or in any other realm, but in the king's proper dominions only; conse∣quently, this language never could be carried into any foreign country. It has no affinity with any other language in the universe; nor is it (like all other languages) subject to any mutations; but continues one pure language through all ages. The grounds of it are amply laid down by the king's herald, with all necessary instructions therein; but the <HI>pronunciation</HI> can never be attained but by the most refined and immediate crudition received from the king's secretary, in which he is always ready to assist us.</P>
<P N="4">4. To learn the behaviour of the court. This science (like the rest) is what none can learn in any other school. The herald lays down proper direc∣tions for this branch of learning; but the secretary alone can inspire us with the <HI>princely mein,</HI> to adorn our behaviour with a becoming grace.—Some per∣sons confound the demeanour of the king's court, with that of the governor's court; but it is a gross mistake: for, though all the excellency of the go∣vernor's court is common to the king's court, there
<PB N="45" REF="009151_0046_10310C99E2D64238"/>
is a peculiarity attending the palace, both in lan∣guage and mein, which none of the proper subjects of the governor were ever able to learn: for, when his court was in its utmost splendor, these peculiar excellencies were utterly unknown in his dominion; and, since the glory of his court was ruined, by the inroads of the monster, he has not a loyal subject in the universe, properly belonging to himself. For those that are in league with the monster, are rebel∣lious subjects, whatever pretences they make of loyalty: and those that have been brought back to give due honour to his excellency the governor, (as it was not his, but the king's power and good∣ness, whereby they were reclaimed) they are not properly his, but the king's subjects. And though many of those pretendedly loyal, but really rebelli∣ous subjects of the governor (confounding the two courts, one with the other, through there being real strangers to both) have imagined, they had attained to the accomplishments of the palace; and could mimick the king's subjects, so far as to impose up∣on the ignorant; yet, in reality, they were as far from attaining to the truth thereof, as parrots, monkeys, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are from attaining to the proper actions of men.—But the king's sons (and they only) being endowed with privileges peculiar to themselves, are capable of learning the royal sciences, which are peculiar to their dignity. For, the air they breathe in; the waters they drink, and bathe in; the food they live upon; the clothing they wear; the clear and large prospects they view; the ground they walk upon; with the society they con∣verse with, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> are so many preparatives to qualify them for receiving those sublime instructions. And thus they become proficients to those profound sciences, which remain impenetrable secrets to the most learned, wise, and ingenious of all other na∣tions.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="009151_0047_10310C9B77402658"/>But we differ much from some celebrated bands, who have been much gazed at by the world, and much valued by themselves, on account of their keeping some branches of knowledge secret from the vulgar; for we never use art to conceal our learning and knowledge, nor amuse persons by eva∣sions; but, in a sincere open manner, are ready to give an answer to any one that asketh us a reason, of any thing that we profess; yea, we are glad to inform any person as far as we can; and rejoice to find any desirous or capable of receiving instruction. Therefore, it is not want to public spirit, in them that are initiated into these mysteries, that they are kept secret from all other people; (for all the grounds, and rules, belonging to each of these sciences, are made public, to be seen by all) but it is owing to the rudeness of their capacities, the grossness of their taste, and indocibleness of their natures, that things so refined are too sublime for their conceptions. And all the nations upon earth are strangers to the king's secretary; (who alone can inspire persons with an apt genius for learning the royal sciences) except those in his majesty's own realm. Some are insensible, and unconcerned; some despise and contemn him; and others give him nominal honours, but esteem him as a being meerly <HI>ideal.</HI> And while it is thus with them, they must remain strangers to the excellencies of the kingdom; for the knowledge thereof, is, to them, impossible.</P>
<P>In this college we remain students, and become true mathematicians; our studies being all upon substantial things, and all our solutions grounded upon facts. We practise no chimera nor exercise ourselves in empty flights of fancy, only those things which are useful and durable, and admit of just demonstration, are objects of our re-searches. Our pursuits are not follies of speculation, but true
<PB N="47" REF="009151_0048_10310C9EA96BC668"/>
wisdom and reality; so that however useful other sciences, and the instructions given in other schools, may be, in their proper place; there is not any learning in the world that is worthy to be esteemed any more than chaff or dung, when compared with the profound wisdom, taught by the great <HI>master of our assembly</HI>—And we pursue the study of these things with great delight, not only as they yield us much pleasure and profit, in our present situation; but as they inspire our hearts with future hopes of solid and everlasting felicity. For we are assured, that when we are arrived to such a degree of learn∣ing, and accomplished with those qualifications, which the king designs for us, he will come in the glory of his majesty, and carry us home in triumph, and make us fellows of the royal society, at his imperial court, where we shall be blessed with the knowledge of such mysteries, as never yet <HI>entered into the heart of man.</HI></P>

<P>But as the main thing in view is an answer to the proposed question, it is necessary to be a little more particular concerning the production of the <HI>monster.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="009151_0053_10310CB0EB381258"/>This monster, being the natural off-spring of the devil, can be no other than that <HI>evil genius</HI> which is in the fallen race; or that fatal degeneracy into which mankind is sunk; or that enmity against God's holy law, which is in every unregenerate soul.</P>
<P>And the nature of the infection, or the thing brought forth, must be according to the seed of which it is engendered; which appears in these three things:</P>
<LIST>
<HEAD><HI>First,</HI> The seed injected.</HEAD>
<ITEM>1. Atheism, in denying the truth of God; <HI>Ye shall not surely die.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Ingratitude, charging God with unkindness, or taxing him with prohibiting some good thing; <HI>For God doth know, that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened.</HI></ITEM>

<ITEM>4. Vain wandering; <HI>Knowing good and evil.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>

<HEAD><HI>Secondly.</HI> The conception formed.</HEAD>
<ITEM>1. Depravity, taking evil for good; <HI>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Corruption, taking pleasure in the evil; <HI>And that it was pleasant to the eyes.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. Alienating from God, in placing the desire contrary to his will; <HI>And a tree to be desired to make one wise.</HI></ITEM>

<P><PB N="53" REF="009151_0054_10310CB5CD6E3B80"/>By these, as so many letters, we may spell out the monster's name; and it will stand thus:</P>

<P>Depravity, Corruption, Alienation.—<HI>Lust.</HI></P>

<P>Revolt, Transgression, Rebellion.—<HI>Sin.</HI></P>
<P>This is that abominable <HI>name,</HI> whose accursed <HI>na∣ture</HI> estranged our first parents from God, and po∣luted all their internal faculties; as appears by their hiding themselves from the face of their Creator, and the prevaricating excuses they made for their crime. And the contagion hath so diffused itself through all their posterity, that the same seed hath been received, the same conceptions formed, and the same produc∣tions brought forth, in every individual of the human species, ever since; and has been the bane of man∣kind, the cause of all the mischief that ever was in the world; having utterly ruined all the virtues, all the beauties, all the enjoyments, and all the comforts of all the sons and daughters of <HI>Adam,</HI> internal, and external, for time and for eternity.</P>
<P>This is that horrible unnatural production, whereby souls, bodies, cities, armies, nations, yea, the whole world, have been filled with all kinds of misery and destruction.</P>
<P>Yet, so far as means, or moral suasion were pra∣ticable, God has not been wanting in instructions, warnings, counsel, admonitions, mercies, threat∣nings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if by any means the evil might have been prevented, or the malady healed; but all has proved <HI>ineffectual.</HI></P>
<P>Therefore, the intrinsick evil of sin, and its dreadful
<PB N="54" REF="009151_0055_10310CB799656760"/>
effects, the perfection that is in Christ, and his great salvation, are the subjects of all our <HI>enquiries.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>The first part of the question answered; or a description of sin.</HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> Where is the dwelling-place of sin?</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> Nothing can operate where it is not, or has no existence; consequently sin can have no influence where it has no residence; therefore, where∣ever its effects appear, there is its <HI>dwelling-place.</HI>—In heaven it has no place at all.—In hell it has an an unbounded habitation.—In earth sin virtually dwells in all inanimate and irrational beings; for every thing pernicious in the creation, is the effect of the curse, which is universal, (excepting so far, and so long, as God in mercy is pleased to restrain its effects; preserving the natural virtues of the creatures for the use of man) and shall issue in the final destruction of the whole.—In mankind it dwells essentially with unlimited extension, (excepting so far as God's uni∣versal goodness is pleased to restrain it, to preserve the world from utter confusion) and its strong hold, and fixed residence, is in the heart; from whence it diffuseth itself through every faculty of soul and body; the hands, the feet, the mouth, the eyes, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the understanding, the will, the affections, the con∣science, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yea, every thought, word, and action, are tainted with sin; whereby total ruin is become inevitable to the whole man.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> What form doth sin bear?</P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Wheresoever sin prevails, it communicates its own likeness; therefore, whatever image is impressed upon any creature thereby, that is its <HI>resemblance.</HI>—By sin, angels became devils; therefore, whatever is horrible in the devil (his nature, his works, or his condition) is the manifestation, or real appearance of
<PB N="55" REF="009151_0056_10310CB921DA59F0"/>
sin, in that abandoned creature; for the devil is the most finished image of sin.—The curse introduced by sin, caused all the antipathy that appears in the irra∣tional part of the creation; therefore, whatever is frightful in beasts, detestable in reptiles, irksome in vegetables, or inclement in any of the elements, is the similitude of sin.—Sin produced all the evil that is in mankind: therefore, all internal wickedness, whether spiritual; as atheism, hypocrisy, murmur∣ing, hatred against God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or natural; as pride, envy, malice, deceit, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and all external wicked∣ness, whether verbal; as prophaning the name of God, blasphemy, cursing, threatning, defaming, ly∣ing, filthy communication, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or actual; as murder, adultery, theft, drunkenness, and all abominations, are the image of sin.—Likewise, sin is its own punish∣ment; or all punishment is its natural production: therefore, all internal grief, distraction, and horror of mind; all external pain, sickness, sorrow, anguish, and misery; all the ghastly appearances of death, and all the dark horrors of hell and damnation, do bear the very image and true representation of sin.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>What number of limbs, and members, pertain to sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> They are called a <HI>multitude.</HI>—But to form a judgment of their number, we must consider their <HI>modifications</HI> and <HI>operations.</HI> The former appears in the numbers of sinful actions; which actions are multiplied by the number of sinful words attending every action; which words are again multiplied by the number of sinful thoughts from whence those words proceed; which thoughts are also multiplied by the number of sinful principles, from whence they are produced. For instance, <HI>Jeroboam</HI>'s wicked thought sprang from a number of sinful principles; as, contempt of the pure worship of God, despising his commandment, distrusting his faithfulness, ingrati∣tude
<PB N="56" REF="009151_0057_10310CBFAB1FF678"/>
to his great benefactor, covetousness, pride, slavish fear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And, as it was supported by so many roots, it diffused itself into as great a number of sinful branches. Thus sin is multiplied into itself.—The latter appears in the opposition which sin makes a∣gainst God. For sin causes a disregard of all the rich discoveries which God gives of himself; an abuse of the multitude of his mercies; a breach of all his commandments; a despising of all his counsels; a misimprovement of all gracious opportunities; and a corruption of all the powers of nature, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Thus, the numbers of sins are encreased, by the multiplication of all these, one into another. For every command of God which we break, is attended with so many ag∣gravations, as we had been favoured with discoveries of the will of God, to inform us; mercies to engage us; counsels to guide us; powers and opportunities to prevent the evil; <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And all these are enrolled in the books, which shall be opened at the last day</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>What is the measure of sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is said of sin, that is reaches to <HI>heaven.</HI>—But to find the true dimension of its stature, we must en∣quire how high it has prevailed: for no effect can be greater than its cause; and all defection, misery, and destruction, are the effects of sin; therefore, wheresoever any of these effects have prevailed, so high sin hath ascended.—In the creation it has pre∣vailed, over the ground, in bringing a curse; over the mountains, in bringing a deluge; over the vege∣tables, in destroying their beauty and virtue; over the animals, in causing them pain and sorrow; over the clouds, in causing restraint; over the sun, moon, heavens, and stars, in bringing darkness upon them; over angels, in casting them down to hell; over all the excellencies of human nature, in bringing cor∣ruption, misery, and death; yea (so far as he is a creature) over the son of God himself, in subjecting
<PB N="57" REF="009151_0058_10310CC1332BA3D0"/>
him to death.—Also the height of sin appears in its <HI>attempts</HI> and <HI>designs.</HI> For, whether they be carried into execution, or not, the malignity, the guilt, and just desert of sin, are equal to the design; and the heinousness is aggravated, according to the excellency of the being, against whom the design is formed—Against the eternal perfections of God; against his omniscience; against his omnipotence; against his holiness; against his righteousness; against his good∣ness; against his faithfulness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—Likewise the extent of sin appears in the depth of the misery which ensues; for so low as any creature is cast down there∣by, so deep doth sin extend:—to the lowest hell, beneath all the rays of light; beneath all comfort; beneath all mercy; beneath all hope, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>As to the breadth of sin; it is as the <HI>thick cloud.</HI>—But the extent is best understood, by the distance it separates one being from another, wheresoever it comes between. It separates creatures from God; it has fixed such ignorance, alienation, and enmity in all mankind, that they can neither know, desire, nor seek after God: it has filled the consciences of men with guilt, so that they cannot enjoy peace with God, nor have courage to approach his presence; but find themselves held in exile, by an unpassable gulph.—It separates man from his original purity: he was made upright, in the image of God, but by sin is be∣come altogether vanity; made very good, but by sin degenerated, to be only evil. The heart is become as adamant; and the whole constitution of nature is corrupted. Thus, so far as the east is from the west, sin hath separate man from God; and, so far as the south is from the north, sin hath separated man from his original purity.—Sin is not infinite in his existence, for it resides in finite beings; nor in its prevalency, for God restrains it. But as it is against the infinite perfections of God, as it tends to an infinite separa∣tion
<PB N="58" REF="009151_0059_10310CC2FA493038"/>
from God, and so to the creature's infinite loss and misery; it contains infinite hatefulness, and de∣serves infinite punishment.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>What is the weight of sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This appears in its <HI>insupportableness.</HI>—The earth is not able to bear it; the pillars of heaven tremble, and cannot sustain it; the angels that sinned, are eternally sunk under it; the corporeal constitu∣tion of man cannot sustain, but is consumed and crushed to dust by it; the soul of man is not able to support itself under sin, but is utterly overwhelmed; the human nature of Christ was not able to sustain the load of sin, but alone through the power of the God-head.</P>
<P>Again, it appears in its <HI>unmoveableness.</HI>—The law being the strength of sin, it is easier to remove heaven and earth: all the improvements that can possibly be made of earthly riches are of no avail; no legal sa∣crifices can take away sin; all moral obedience can∣not justify a soul from it; no prayers, or religious performances, can procure remission of it; the great∣est abundance of oblations, or event the fruit of a man's body, cannot atone for the sin of his soul: therefore, it is heavier than the whole creation, since all the creation shall be crushed to pieces by it. <HI>Je∣sus Christ</HI> sustains the whole creation by his word; but could not remove sin, without pouring out his soul unto death.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>What is, and wherein lies, the strength of sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This may be understood by its number, weight and measure: <HI>for, as the man is, so is his strength.</HI>—But, in particular, its power appears in its <HI>opera∣tions.</HI>—Every creature that enters the paths of sin, is made captive thereby, and held in perpetual bondage. Nor was it ever known that any created being (when once ensnared) was able (in the least degree) to ex∣tricate
<PB N="59" REF="009151_0060_10310CC6310433D8"/>
himself out of the chains of sin. They may shift hands, and by changing the forms of sin, may impose upon themselves, to fancy they obtain liberty; but they that think themselves most at liberty, are frequently most in bondage. Likewise, sin hath power to fill the soul with distress and anguish; to kill and destroy all its hope and comfort; to bring natural death upon all mankind universally; and to torment both soul and body in hell, to all <HI>eternity.</HI></P>
<P>And the strength of sin centers in carnality of mind; whereby all the powers are held in bondage: in guilt and horror of conscience, whereby the soul is filled with anguish and distress; and in alienation from God, whereby all blessings are abdicated, life, and all en∣joyments forfeited, and death and misery become in∣evitable.—Also the damnatory power of sin, is the <HI>law.</HI> And the power of damnation, or misery of the damned, lies in a restless desire after self-suffi∣ciency, or seeking satisfaction in something that is not God; which is that gnawing worm that never dies.—In enmity against God; which is an un∣quenchable fire in the soul. And in rebellion against God; which provokes the burning wrath of God; and brings it down upon the soul, unquenchable and eternal. Therefore, sin is <HI>invincible</HI> in its power, to every created being.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>What is the loudness of the voice of sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This is to be conceived of, by the distance at which it may be heard; which is from earth to hea∣ven. And it hath been found by many, that neither distance of place, or time, nor change of company, or circumstances, could silence or allay the <HI>dreadful sound,</HI> which sin causeth in the ears.—Also by the piercing shocks it gives where the sound comes; causing every ear to <HI>tingle;</HI> and every heart to trem∣ble.—It was sin that caused all the camp of <HI>Israel</HI> to tremble at mount <HI>Sinai.</HI> The law could not have
<PB N="60" REF="009151_0061_10310CC9641D5C80"/>
caused terror, had it not been joined by the echo of sin in their consciences. For there is nothing terri∣ble to any creature, but where there is antipathy; and there is no antipathy between the law of God, and the creatures of God, only so far as sin has pre∣vailed in them. No terror attended the giving of the law, when man was in sinless state. And every voice that proceeds from God, or manifestation of God, that raises terror in men's hearts, it is sin alone that is that <HI>cause.</HI>—It is impossible there should be fear, sorrow, or shame, where there is no guilt; or guilt where there is no sin. Though guilt in the conscience, frequently brings fear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> concerning things which have no real existence,—And the strength of the voice of sin may be judged of, from the obstacles it pierceth through: through the shade of the trees of <HI>Eden:</HI> through the courage of ar∣mies; through the grandeur of monarchs; through the religion of the strictest <HI>Pharisees,</HI> &amp;c.—Thus, the voice of sin appears to be so loud as to alarm and shake the whole <HI>creation.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>How poisonous is the nature of sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This is manifest in four things:—The <HI>spread∣ing contagion.</HI> The woman caught it from the ser∣pent, and the man from the woman, by conversation; and it descended to all posterity, by generation. And where sin prevails, in any particular form, it will com∣municate itself in the same form, if there be a con∣versation, or so much as an inspection.—The <HI>depth of the infection.</HI> It hath penetrated through all the powers of nature, the head, heart, mind, conscience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yea, it hath overspread all the faculties of the soul, and all the members of the body; so that no part is free from the most mortal disease.—That <HI>rank∣ling inflammation.</HI> It continually burns with restless torture, raging, and distraction.—The <HI>irrevokeable∣ness of the plague thereof.</HI> No antidote in nature
<PB N="61" REF="009151_0062_10310CCFF3667A50"/>
can eradicate, no medicine in the creation of God can remove it; the hurt is utterly incurable; so that all the balm in <HI>Gilead</HI> (that is, all the excellency in man) is not sufficient to yield the least <HI>relief.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>How deep are the deceits and subtilties of sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This is to be learned by the persons which are beguiled thereby, which, in general, are the <HI>whole world;</HI> and in particular the <HI>innocent,</HI> the <HI>wise,</HI> and the <HI>religious.</HI>—The means whereby sin deceives souls: imaginary pleasure, which infatuates the mind; imaginary hopes, which encourage them to persist; pride of heart, which makes despise submission to the most high; and vain-glory, which fills them with imaginations of self-sufficiency.—The things wherein they are deceived; the most excel∣lent things appear in a base light: they imagine God to be like themselves; Christ a vile person; the Holy Ghost a daemon; the law of God unjust; the gospel a delusion; the worship of God contemptible; and his people a reproach, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And the basest things appear in a commendable light; evil like good; darkness like light; sinners like saints; and devils like angels of light, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—The effects of the these deceptions: hardening men's hearts; stupifying their minds; s;ettling them in a form of godliness, without the power; deluding them with imaginary peace, and safety, till eternal destruction come upon them.—Be∣sides, the deceit that dwells in the servants of sin. Their heart is replete with hypocrisy; their practices are with all <HI>deceivableness of unrighteousness;</HI> and their subtil devices, artful inventions, and delusive schemes, are contrived with design (if it were possible) to <HI>deceive the very elect.</HI>—Therefore, sin is mystery of iniquity, too deep for any to fathom, but he alone who searches the hearts, and tries the reins.</P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>With what weapons, and in what manner, doth sin fight?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="009151_0063_10310CD1C011F990"/><HI>A.</HI> The weapons of sin, are, <HI>first,</HI> Offensive; whereby iniquity prevails, souls are overcome, and satan's kingdom is enlarged: which, when he attacks in front, to carry souls headlong from God, to de∣stroy all virtue and morality, are <HI>the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life.</HI> But when he charges in flank, or fights in ambuscade, to break the lines of reason, or surprize the guards of con∣science; then his weapons are a <HI>corrupt mind, self∣will,</HI> and <HI>unbelief.—Secondly,</HI> Defensive weapons; whereby sinners are held in bondage, and defended against repentance or conviction: which are, hardness of heart, blindness of mind, stupefaction, pride, car∣nal-reasoning, self-righteousness, hypocrisy, enmity against God, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> By these, sin maintains his resi∣dence in the soul; they being the <HI>armour wherein he trusteth.</HI> But when the soul is so closely besieged with light and conviction, that any of these ramparts give way, then sin prepares a murdering-piece [despair] by which he rends all to pieces. For the mind be∣ing distracted with despair, is frequently thrown into a stagnation; which terminates in a kind of lethargy, and so all remorse ceases. Or else the person gets the storm allayed by a form of religion, and settles there; and purposely avoids any further searches into his state, lest it should cast him into despair again.—And as to his way of fighting, sin hath two engines, with which he manages all his weapons, in every en∣gagement, <HI>[deceit and violence]</HI> and by these, the soul is drawn away, and entangled in the snare; or driven, with rapid force, into excess and misery; so that the wisest man cannot escape, nor is the strongest able to withstand.</P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>What are the victories and dominions of sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Respecting his <HI>victories;</HI> sin has triumphed over all the fallen angels; over every individual of the human race; over every power, passion, and member of
<PB N="63" REF="009151_0064_10310CD348572D78"/>
of soul and body; and has reduced all mankind to the utmost degree of slavery, so as to be taken captive by satan at his will, brought into subjection to every particular sinful thought, word and action, whensoever it becomes suitable to their taste and constitution. Having divested them of every thing that is sub∣stantially good; and brought them into the most ex∣treme poverty and wrethchedness, and deprived them of all solid consolation; and reduced them to the ut∣most depth of anguish and misery; having introduced death unavoidable, upon every creature in this world, and damnation in the world to come.—And according to his victories, so are his <HI>dominions.</HI> The whole world, and every creature therein, with every mem∣ber and faculty of those creatures, are held in total subjection to his tyranny; and in them he reigns with despotick power, proclaiming himself, <HI>The invincible universal monarch.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>What is the age and duration of sin?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> Sin hath had an existence from the beginning; ever since creatures chose their own ways: for it entered into the world by the <HI>first man.</HI>—Sin must have a duration of absolute necessity, wheresoever it has once had a being; until the Son of God shall be pleased to take to him his great power, and reign, to the destruction of his enemies. For sin is not a <HI>creature:</HI> if it was, it must be dependent on God to sustain it in being; or otherwise it must naturally and unavoidably cease to be. But it is the <HI>privation,</HI> or ruin, of the creature's excellency; and, there∣fore, cannot possibly come to a period, any other way, than by the restoration of the creature to its primi∣tive rectitude. Therefore, wheresoever Christ doth not assert his authority, to rescue the captive soul, and destroy sin, it will survive the earth the heavens, and retain its full strength to all <HI>eternity.</HI> For sin, is a <HI>fire,</HI> which none but Jesus can quench; and the
<PB N="64" REF="009151_0065_10310CD676B474A0"/>
soul is <HI>fuel,</HI> on which it will feed, as long as the creature hath any existence.—The provocation can never be forgotten; the infection can never cease; the worm of guilt can never die; nor the fire of en∣mity be quenched.—The wrath of God is un∣quenchable, and eternal; the gulph of misery is im∣passable; and the torments due to sin, <HI>can have no end.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>The second part if the question answered; or a description of the damage done by sin.</HEAD>
<P>In order to a discovery of the damage done, it is necessary to understand, who are the <HI>sufferers,</HI> and wherein they have <HI>suffered</HI> by sin. The sufferers are, <HI>the holy law of God,</HI> and <HI>the creature, man.</HI> And the things wherein they have suffered, will ap∣pear by comparing their <HI>original station,</HI> with their present <HI>position.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning the law of God, it is undeniably ma∣nifest, that the whole world is under it; and every son and daughter of <HI>Adam,</HI> is indispensably bound to live in subjection, and perpetual conformity to it. And that the law is absolutely inviolable, appears from a two fold consideration.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> The natural and necessary obligation, which all creatures are under to God, as their creator, sustainer, and benefactor. This is founded in the na∣ture and fitness of things. For as we have received our being, and every degree of well-being, from him alone; we are under a natural, and indispensible obligation, in point of gratitude, to live to his glory, and to devote all the powers of soul and body, to the will of him, in whom we live, move, and exist. All just laws are originally founded upon <HI>natural obliga∣tions;</HI> and all reasonable obedience to superiors, is no other than <HI>strict gratitude;</HI> which becomes their proper due, in consequence of favour received from them. This is the true ground of the moral law, and so long as God is God, and creatures continue
<PB N="65" REF="009151_0066_10310CDD0A2D6090"/>
to be intelligent beings, the obligation can <HI>never cease;</HI> nor is it possible for any circumstance to make it <HI>void.</HI>—The angels of glory are debtors to JEHOVAH, for all their excellencies; consequently they are bound in duty to shew forth his praise. The devil is a creature, and every creature of God is <HI>good;</HI> there∣fore (notwithstanding the evil he has contracted) so long as he has a being, he enjoys some good from God; and consequently continues under an obligation, or law of gratitude. <HI>The devil sinneth from the be∣ginning;</HI> but if he were not under a law, he could not sin; for, <HI>Where there is no law, there is no transgression.</HI>—Likewise, among the sons of men, eve∣ry creature is under obligations to God, according to the favours he enjoys: the greater the favours, the greater the obligations. So that saints in glory will eternally remain under the highest obligations of <HI>gratitude;</HI> that is, under the law of God, considered simply as a law, not as a covenant.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The divine authority stamped upon the simple law of nature, gives sanction to this obligation. And this authority consists in three things:—1. Doctrine whereby God has revealed to mankind his will, con∣cerning the way in which they are to shew their gratitude to him; having taught and instructed them, how they might obey him in an acceptable manner.—2. The commandment whereby God requires from the creature that obedience, submission, and confor∣mity to his will, which his goodness to that creature justly deserved; which, therefore, that creature is under a native obligation to perform; and God has a native right to demand.—3. A covenant, stipulating the conditions of obedience, and disobedience, to the holy precept; with promises and threatnings, bles∣sings and curses, annexed thereto.</P>
<P>From these two fountains, the law of God re∣ceives sovereign power over all creatures. For all

that God enjoins, is purely natural; as, <HI>To love God and our neighbour,</HI> is an obligation inseparable from our being, our relation to God, and to our fellow-creatures. And whatsoever is a concomitant of the natural obligation, is included in the injunction, <HI>With all thy heart,—soul,—strength,—mind,</HI>—and <HI>as thyself.</HI> So that a natural obligation, <HI>founded on our very being,</HI> and inforced by the <HI>divine sanction,</HI> must be superlatively, universally, and eternally binding, to every intelligent being in the creation. Therefore, the authoritative power of the holy law, extends to every creature, in every capacity; whilst innocent, to command, to promise and to threaten; and when sinful, to convince, to condemn, and to curse; but is not invested with any influential power, either to prevent, or remove sin. Notwith∣standing, the law is not deficient in all suasive means, warnings, instructions, admonitions, reproofs, threat∣enings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But inasmuch as its power is only <HI>mandatory,</HI> not <HI>physical; judicial</HI> not <HI>operative;</HI> all its measures to prevent the evil, to heal the plague, or repair the damage, have proved abortive. There∣fore, the law has no other way to do itself justice, or vindicate its honour, but by the destruction of the sin∣ner; for it cannot possibly recover what it has lost by sin. Which is,</P>
<P N="1">1. All mankind have revolted from under the ju∣risdiction of the holy law, and become the servants of sin; and hereby the law is spoiled in its dominion; its authority is wrongfully taken away; its govern∣ment wrested from it; and it is deprived of its right and property in its <HI>subjects.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Perfect and perpetual obedience is due to God's law; but all the children of <HI>Adam,</HI> are become <HI>children of disobedience:</HI> being the servants of sin, and yielding obedience thereto, whereby the law of God is injuriously deprived of all its just <HI>revenue.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="67" REF="009151_0068_10310CE0348A2648"/>3. The heart is the proper residence, or dwelling-place, of God's law. But by sin it has been violently ejected, and every apartment in its palace, possessed by its implacable enemy: the will, the understand∣ing, the affections, the conscience, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> inhabited with rebellion, darkness, enmity, and pollution; so that the holy law is banished from its indubitable right, and from its native <HI>habitation.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. The holy law of God is worthy of the highest honour, profound reverence, sacred regard, and hum∣ble obedience, from every rational being; but, thro' the prevalence of sin, is esteemed a stranger, stub∣bornly rejected, violently treated, and contemptuously despised; insomuch that all its honour and dignity are taken away, and <HI>trampled in the dust.</HI></P>
<P>Concerning mankind, it is certain, that his primi∣tive state was perfection, unblemished beauty, excel∣lent dignity, and princely glory; which, compared with the wretched depravity, in which his whole na∣ture is now involved, discovers the damage it hath sustained by sin.</P>
<P N="1">1. Man was made upright. As he came out of the hands of his Maker, <HI>very good,</HI> he must be per∣fect in purity; but, by sin, he is become altogether <HI>filthy, only evil continually, no part clean;</HI> nor can any clean thing be produced from him; for all his original purity is <HI>perished.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Man was made in the image of God: there∣fore he was <HI>crowned with glory and honour;</HI> being the most excellent piece of God's handy-work, be∣neath the stars; but, by sin, he is degraded to a level with the beasts and worms; and all his dignity is <HI>pe∣rished in the dust.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Man was placed in the imperial throne, having sovereign dominion over all the works of God, in this world; but, by sin, this dominion is lost: the
<PB N="68" REF="009151_0069_10310CE364CE0EE0"/>
creatures now yield obedience no farther than they are tamed by force, to fear and dread; or soothed by art, to become gentle. And by turns they rebel, and put mankind in the greatest fear. Yea man has lost the dominion over himself, and is enslaved to a brutish appetite; and captivated under subjection to the devil himself, who has usurped the throne, which man abdicated, and is become the prince of this world.</P>
<P N="4">4. Man was perfectly free from evil: but, by sin, he is subjected to all manner of evil. His body is subject to every sickness, and every sore; to every painful, and every loathsome disease. His soul is subject to every wicked conception; and to every mi∣serable distraction. So that all he is, all he does, and all he enjoys, is perpetually attended with some plague, or annoyance.</P>
<P N="5">5. Man was blessed with compleat enjoyment of all good things which the earth could produce, or whereby his nature might be made happy. But, by sin, all things in the world are become subject to corruption. Every blessing beneath the sun is alto∣gether uncertain, and mixed with bitterness; so that in all terrestrial excellencies, nothing remains but the <HI>shadow;</HI> the real substantial enjoyment is <HI>vanished away.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Man was free from all guilt, fear, or shame, be∣fore God. But, by sin, all his powers are filled with guilt, horror, and confusion. For a sinful man is not able to endure the majesty of the Lord. They cannot bear the signs of heaven, or meditate on the omniscience of God; nor think of his approach in death, in judgment, but it fills their hearts with a∣mazement.</P>
<P N="7">7. Man in his primitive state, had frequent visits from God, and enjoyed communion with his <HI>Maker.</HI> But, thro' sin, he was banished from God's presence,
<PB N="69" REF="009151_0070_10310CEA1C26AE28"/>
and is become an alien and stranger to God; being <HI>far off, without hope, and without God in the world.</HI></P>
<P>For, by sin, the greatness of God, as creator, has been contemned; his power, as sustainer, has been despised; his goodness, as benefactor, has been un∣gratefully disregarded; his majesty, as governor, has been insulted; his holiness, as law-giver, has been prophaned; his justice, as judge, has been provoked; and his wrath, as executioner, incensed. So that man hath intirely cut himself off from all property in God. He has no right to any favour or blessing whatsoever; nor has he any way to escape divine vengeance; nor is it possible for a sinner to approach the holy God; or to form any just conceptions of the eternal Jehovah, but as <HI>a consuming fire.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="3" TYPE="answer">
<HEAD>The third part of the question answered; or a de∣scription of Christ, and his sufficiency.</HEAD>
<P>The only glimpse of hope that remains for man∣kind, is in the revelation which God has made of himself, in his sacred word; or in the gospel of his son <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> Wherein he has revealed himself under a different character from any thing that could be discovered by the law, or with which the law could have any concern; and wherein he is manifestly declared to stand in a different capacity, and relati∣on; that is, a FATHER. This is a peculiar name; expressing the nearness of the relation, between God and his only begotten son, <HI>Jesus Christ;</HI> and also the nearness of the relation betwixt him and his pe∣culiar people, as they stand adopted in Christ; as well as the riches of his love and grace, freely flow∣ing thro' his beloved Son, to all the heirs of God. This appellation is never used in scripture, to express God's relation to mankind, as the creator, or God of nature; nor does God ever give the appellation of sons, or children, to any, but in consideration of their being the peculiar objects of his love, in Christ <HI>Jesus;</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="009151_0071_10310CEBA5864708"/>
or at least, professors, associating with his people, and externally separated from the world; to such (if hy∣pocrites) the term may be used ironically. In the same peculiar sense, his name GOD is always to be understood, when used with terms of appropriation; as, <HI>thy God, my God,</HI> &amp;c. This is that inseparable relation, which no power in heaven, earth, or hell, can break; nor can time, or eternity, wear it away; neither can sin, or death, or guilt, or enmity, or dark∣ness, or wrath, or misery, penetrate between God and the objects of his love in Christ <HI>Jesus.</HI> This is the alone foundation of hope to sinners; and the alone source of grace and mercy.</P>
<P>The love of God the Father, to his elect, did not cease, when the obedience of the creature ceased; and therefore he undertook to provide deliverance for sinners; <HI>he laid help upon one that is mighty;</HI> and promised, that he should not fail, nor be discour∣aged;—that he should <HI>make an end of sin;</HI> and should be the <HI>salvation of God;</HI> in whom his people should be eternally saved.</P>
<P>This great deliverer proceeded forth, and came from God. He, therefore, is God, equal with the Father, having in himself all the divine perfections: or all the glorious attributes of deity.</P>
<P>He is infinite, eternal, immortal, immutable, self-existent, independent, incomprehensible, invisible, om∣nipotent, omniscient, omnipresent, all-sufficient, holy, just, good, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This divine <HI>Word was made flesh.</HI> Conceived in the virgin's womb; <HI>made of a woman; took on him the seed of</HI> Abraham; <HI>was made of the seed of</HI> David <HI>according to the flesh; and is declared to be the son of God.</HI>—Therefore, his name is JEHOVAH THE MAN; <HI>Emmanuel,</HI> or <HI>God manifest in the flesh.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="009151_0072_10310CED2E9C6750"/>With God, he is <HI>the brightness of</HI> the Father's <HI>glory,</HI> and <HI>the express of his person.</HI> And is called, THE HOLY ONE.—Between God and man, he is the <HI>center of amity;</HI> having, in his divine na∣ture, all incommunicable perfections; and, in his human nature, (through its consummate union with the divine) a perfect fulness of all communicable grace. That is, he is replete with all the excellen∣cies, glories, and perfections, wherewith it is possible for any being to abound; whereby God can be pleased, or man can be blessed; and is called the ME∣DIATOR.—To his people he is <HI>wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption;</HI> and is called THE SAVIOUR.—And when he is beheld in an extensive light; in the relation in which he stands to God; in all his counsels, purposes, promises, works, and ma∣nifestations of himself; and in the relation in which he stands to his church; in all the blessings of nature, grace, and glory: his name stands thus:</P>
<P>His specific name is — LORD.</P>
<P>His sir-name is — CHRIST.</P>
<P>His proper name is — JESUS.</P>
<P>Or it may stand thus:</P>
<P>Essential name — I AM.</P>
<P>Relative name — ALL IN ALL.</P>
<P>Dispensatory name — ALPHA AND OMEGA.</P>
<P>This is he, whom God, <HI>the Father, sanctified, and sent into the world,</HI> to save his people from their sins; which leads to the particular enquiries, whether he be sufficient to undertake and accomplished such a <HI>work.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Where is Christ's dwelling-place?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He dwells in God the Father; in his essence; in his will; in his love; in his counsels and pur∣poses;
<PB N="72" REF="009151_0073_10310CEEB76ECBC0"/>
in all his perfections; and all the perfections of God dwell in him. Therefore, as Christ is God, he dwells in all created beings; and all created be∣ings dwell in him. Yea, he fills infinite space, and eternal duration.</P>
<P>His presence is universally manifest, by his sustain∣ing power, in every creature, time, and place: in heaven; where sin is not, he appears in his glory; in earth, where sin is permitted, so far as he pleases, and restrained when he pleases, he appears in his goodness; in hell, where sin rages without controul, he appears in his terror. His presence is manifest in all inanimate creatures, as they possess virtues; in all animals, as they are endued with usefulness; in the devil, as he is possessed with intelligence and activity; in the angels of God, in holiness, power, wisdom, and vivacity in obeying his will; in wicked men, by intelligence in their souls, and power of action in their bodies; in his saints, in quickening, transforming, and comforting grace; and will dwell in them, by communications of his glory, to all eternity.</P>
<P>Now be it observed, That all that has an existence, is of <HI>God,</HI> the creator of all things; to whom infinity of space, and eternity of duration, are absolutely ne∣cessary.—<HI>Creatures</HI> are the work of his hands.—<HI>Sin</HI> is the corruption or privation of the creature's purity.—And it is impossible that Christ should dwell in sin, or sin in him; but he dwells in every other being.—He dwells in God, where sin never did, or ever can exist; he inhabits eternal duration, and fills infinite space; but sin cannot possibly subsist, either in dura∣tion or space, only so far as it possesses some creature. And in those creatures, where sin has no residence, there Christ dwells in his uprightness, and in those creatures, where sin prevails, Christ must reside in his sustaining power; otherwise the creature could not subsist, and consequently sin could have no being. Therefore, he is sufficient to dispossess sin.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="73" REF="009151_0074_10310CF6E5A47D68"/>2. <HI>What form doth Christ bear?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He is the <HI>express image,</HI> and <HI>form of God.</HI>—Therefore, all the glories, beauties, and excellencies, that ever were beheld by men or angels, shine in him. For all that is precious, or desirable, must either be in God, or in some part of the creation; but there never was any discovery of the glory of God, but as it shined in the face of Jesus Christ; nor was there ever any beauty, or excellency in any creature, but what was received from him. Therefore, Christ is the perfection of beauty; the glorious mirrour of all perfection, created and uncreated; the glory-sun, in whom meet, and center, all the refulgent rays of <HI>light and glory.</HI></P>
<P>Wherefore, those bright beams of holiness, which proceed from Christ, are sufficient to swallow up all the horrible appearances of sin; the glory of his grace is able to dispel every terrible aspect of wrath and damnation; his perfection of rectitude (from whom every creature received its original beauty) is sufficient to restore the native excellency of any crea∣ture, how far soever it has been ruined; or to com∣municate an excellency, equal, or superior, to what was lost by sin. And the rays of divine glory, that shine in the Son of God, are sufficient to transform, into his own likeness, every creature on whom he is pleased to reflect the lustre of his perfections; so that Christ is able to dissipate all the deformity bro't by sin.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>What number is contained in Christ?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> His number is <HI>One,</HI> without division; his number contains <HI>Three,</HI> without multiplication.—And, in this number are contained all that is in God, and all that is in the creation of God.</P>
<P>All the divine perfections, all the wise counsels, all the immuteable purposes, yea, all the thoughts,
<PB N="74" REF="009151_0075_10310CF86DB4E1C8"/>
words, and works of God, are in Christ. In him are opened all the testimonies relating to the nature and will of God; by him are performed all the com∣mandments of God; in him are fulfilled all the pro∣mises of God.—Christ gives being, every creature in heaven, earth, and hell. And every thought, word, and action, of every crea∣ture (whether they be <HI>innocent</HI> and <HI>holy,</HI> or whether they be <HI>sinful</HI>) are performed by power and wis∣dom, or permitted from the Son of God. There∣fore, suppose the number of his divine <HI>dispensations,</HI> multiplied into the number of creature-<HI>operations,</HI> it must infinitely exceed all the numbers of sin.—And further, to prove that Jesus is more than a match, to cope with all the numbers of sin; there has been a general rendezvous of all the infernal host; and the captain of salvation has been attacked, and close∣ly encountered by every warriour, both in the right and left wing; that is, every <HI>temptation</HI> to sin, and every <HI>punishment</HI> merited by sin.—And having spoi∣led all principalities and powers, and led captivity captive, he now abounds with all rich mercies, and all spiritual blessings, for his people.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>What is the measure of Christ?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He cannot be described by any <HI>measure.</HI> For he is incomprehensible, infinite, and eternal. And as his nature is divine, and his glory cannot possibly be circumscribed, nor does his perfection come with∣in the reach of any dimension, so is his love and grace, passing all the knowledge of men and angels.</P>
<P>In height, he is <HI>far above all heavens,</HI> and above every <HI>creature, thing,</HI> or <HI>name;</HI> he reigns invincible, above all the attempts or designs of sin, in the midst of the throne, where sin never was, or ever shall be, able to ascend.—In depth, below all the <HI>deeps</HI> of <HI>sin</HI> and <HI>misery;</HI> below all the <HI>deeps</HI> of <HI>death</HI> and <HI>hell.</HI> Therefore, is able to sustain his people in the utmost
<PB N="75" REF="009151_0076_10310CFA33E47C20"/>
distress; to raise them up from the utmost depths of darkness; and to save them from sin's lowest abyss.—In length, from everlasting to everlasting. The new covenant, of which he is mediator, and all the blessing thereof, are everlasting; therefore, it is not possible that sin should ever extend itself beyond the limits of his grace; because his grace is boundless, without beginning and without end: or that it should find a vacancy in his goodness; because that is per∣petual and immutable.—In breath, beyond all the <HI>aboundings of sin.</HI> And therefore, how far soever sin has separated any creature from God, from their primitive excellency, or from the enjoyment of any blessing; Christ is all-sufficient to bring them near, and to remove sin as far off.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>What weight doth Christ bear?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He is not to be described by any <HI>balance.</HI>—Nothing can ponderate against him, to whom all crea∣tures are lighter than vanity, or like the small dust, whose weight is imperceptible; at whose approach the earth and the heavens <HI>fly away.</HI></P>
<P>And as for the weight of sin, it has been laid upon Christ, in all its heinous nature, aggravations, guilt, condemning power, just deservings, and dreadful effects; with whatsoever is ponderous, piercing, or of∣fensive in it; it came upon him in all its force, like <HI>thick clouds,</HI> with <HI>hailstones,</HI> and <HI>coals of fire;</HI> and he did actually bear it, in his soul, and in his body. He sustained the curse due to sin, like an impregnable rock. His dying for sin, did not shew any want of power, (but depth of love) since he had <HI>power</HI> to lay down his life, and <HI>power</HI> to take it again.</P>
<P>And Christ hath removed sin: he had taken away and extinguished it; yea, he hath so far vanquished, and extirpated it, that the curse, and condemnation thereof, can no more be found; the aggravation, and
<PB N="76" REF="009151_0077_10310D00B7E4E238"/>
guilt thereof, can no more be remembered.—And he is purging out, and will effectually eradicate, from his people, all the pollution, and all the concomitants of sin, so as nothing of the nature, nor any remains of the effect, nor any consequence, or production of it, shall have a being any more.</P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>What is (and wherein lies) the power of Christ?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He hath all power in heaven and in earth; which nothing can destroy, repel, or withstand. He is the creator, sustainer, benefactor, and sovereign dis∣poser of every creature that has a being.—He hath power over all his enemies, to destroy their being; to reduce them to subjection, though against their wills; to punish them with everlasting destruction from his presence; or to convert them from their rebellions, and make them willing subjects.—And he hath power to extirpate sin out of the souls of his people; to deliver from every malady that it has brought; to secure from all the evils, from all the dangers, and from all the fears of it, <HI>to all eternity.</HI>—Yea, has power to enrich his saints with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places; to dignify their natures, and raise them to the highest degree of perfection; and to communicate to them the brightest rays of heavenly glory, <HI>in immortality.</HI></P>
<P>The power of Christ consists in his divine omni∣potence, or being God over all, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All things are in his hands, hence he hath a <HI>despotick</HI> power; he is mediator of the better covenant, hence he hath a <HI>saving</HI> power; he is head over all things to his church, hence he hath a <HI>communicative</HI> power, to bless his elect with grace and glory.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>What is the loudness of the voice of Christ?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> This is known by its <HI>effects.</HI>—1. The pow∣erful voice of Christ moves all the powers of nature;
<PB N="77" REF="009151_0078_10310D02439AE1D0"/>
the heavens shake, and the earth melts.—2. It brings vengeance and destruction upon all his enemies.—3. It sounds to the uttermost bounds of the creation; none of his chosen people can be so far off, but his voice can reach them.—4. His voice pierces through every intervening obstacle; no depth of misery, no grave of sin, no hardness of heart, no blindness of mind, no enmity against God, no hellish tumult in the soul, no worldly temptation, no vanity of mind, no plague of the heart, nor any terrors of wrath, or any thing that can possibly interpose, are able to hinder the joyful sound of grace from the soul, when Jesus speaks, and the Lord opens the heart.—5. The effects, or operations, wrought by the voice of Christ, are many; it is so powerful, as to raise dead souls out of their sins, and dead bodies out of their graves; so clear and distinct, as to be understood by all his peo∣ple; and so sweet and pleasant, as to ravish their hearts, and spread joy through all their powers.—6. His voice is so loud, that it entereth into the ears, and into the bosom of his Father; so as it is always heard, and always answered.—7. So loud is the voice of his <HI>redeeming blood,</HI> and his <HI>prevailing intercession,</HI> and the peace that resounds from it, that the cla∣mours of sin cannot be heard, either before the <HI>throne of God,</HI> or in the <HI>conscience.</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. <HI>What is the nature of Jesus Christ?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> It is perfect <HI>abstracted holiness;</HI> or superla∣tive purity, and excellency; such as no creature in heaven or earth can claim, or pretend to vie with. The brightest luminaries are dark before him; the most exalted intelligences are conscious of imper∣fection, and vail their faces in his presence, with pro∣found reverence, crying, <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy.</HI>—So holy is his nature, that no poison or impurity can possibly touch him; nor any uncleanness abide in his pre∣sence. He cannot look upon an unclean thing; nor
<PB N="78" REF="009151_0079_10310D03CB65FBE8"/>
can any unclean thing look upon him.—The holiness of his nature sanctifies every <HI>person, place,</HI> or <HI>thing,</HI> where he pleases to manifest his presence.—And his purifying virtue cannot fail to be a sufficient antidote against all the poison of sin, to heal every disease, and remove every plague thereof; since his grace is so diffusive, and it is his delight, and constant employ, to <HI>save his people from their sins.</HI>—His healing and cleansing grace, is so influential, that a touch (even of the hem of his garment) produces a cure; so pe∣netrating, as to reach the deepest retreats of the soul; so balsamick, as to cool every inflammation, and re∣move every torture of sin; and so efficacious in its operation, as no malignant humour, nor mortal potion, can prevent its effect. This is that infallible medi∣cine, which suceeds, when all other things fail.</P>
<P N="9">9. <HI>What is the depth of the wisdom of Christ?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> He is <HI>God only wise,</HI> the true wisdom of God; to whom all the craft and subtilty of creatures is mere folly.—Christ is omniscient, to know all things <HI>that are:</HI> His Father's whole will; all that has any ex∣istence in every creature; and all the deep machina∣tions, delusive forms, and dark haunts of sin, with all the progress and effects thereof.—He is wise, to search out, and unravel all the subtilties and deceits of sin; to disconcert all its measures; and to deliver his people from all its inchantments: by pure light to expel the darkness, and by truth to expose falshood; to distinguish between truth and error; and separate the precious from the vile.—He <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> prudent to deter∣mine, and dispose all things that <HI>shall be;</HI> to bring his people out of darkness, and illuminate them with the light of life; to cause them to know themselves, and their miseries by sin; to bless them with the knowledge of the only true God, and the blessings freely given them in him; to prevent the deceptions of sin from seducing their minds, or bringing them
<PB N="79" REF="009151_0080_10310D07001F1CD8"/>
any more under its dominion; to direct the commu∣nications of his grace in season; to answer their ne∣cessities; to order his providential dispensations to work together for good; and to conduct all his little ones with honour and safety to his eternal kingdom.—His wisdom is unsearchable; no design can be formed to frustrate any of his purposes; for his <HI>coun∣sel shall stand.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. <HI>What are Christ's weapons; and in what manner doth he fight?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> The alone weapon with which he makes war, is his <HI>word.</HI>—Christ is represented on horse-back, to shew his swiftness and warlike appearance; with a bow, to shew his strength; with arrows, to shew how exactly he hits the mark, striking the heart; and with a sword, to shew how sharp he cuts, dividing one thing from another: but all these are but emblems of that one irresistible weapon, <HI>The word of God.</HI></P>
<P>By his quick and powerful word he vanquishes all enemies; and, by the same word, he will judge all creatures, and consume all that dare rebel against him. This word endureth for ever; and no adverse power can destroy or wear it out; nor is any creature able to withstand it: for, by this <HI>sword of the Spirit,</HI> Christ breaks through all the opposition, and destroys all the power of sin; drives it out of its close quar∣ters, and delivers his children from its tyranny. And the same word, being full of grace, is a preservative from all the attacks of horror and despair; and a de∣fence against all the fiery darts of satan.</P>
<P>The way of Christ's making war, is in <HI>righteousness and judgment.</HI>—And herein his prowess, con∣duct, and dexterity; for when he comes to rescue his people, he finds them coupled with sin, cemented as closed as the flesh and bone, joints and marrow, or soul and spirit; yet, he manages his weapons with
<PB N="80" REF="009151_0081_10310D0A720EE160"/>
that <HI>masterly skill,</HI> as never to strike a stroke in vain; or by an inadvertant shot to annoy any of his friends, while he wounds his enemies. He never fails to save the soul, and destroy the sin. No obstacle can be so difficult as to baffle him; nor so intricate as to con∣found him; nor any enemy so powerful as to with∣stand him, nor so subtile as to escape him.—They that experience the power of his word in their hearts, can witness the convincing, humbling, quickening, attracting, transforming, comforting, and establishing <HI>power thereof.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. <HI>What are the victories, and dominions of Christ?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A. His right-hand his holy arm hath gotten him the victory.—He hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of iron in sunder.—He hath tri∣umphed gloriously.</HI>—Every thing within the creation of God is subjected (or in subjection) to his sovereign disposal; <HI>for he must reign, till he hath put all ene∣mies under his feet.</HI>—He hath bruised the serpent's head; he hath spoiled principalities and powers; he hath swallowed up death in victory; he hath trampled on all the power of the enemy; he hath destroyed all the works of the devil; he hath taken away the dominion of sin; he hath <HI>led captivity captive.</HI></P>
<P>And now he proclaims liberty to the captives, free∣dom to the prisoners, and deliverance to them that are bound. And all the powers of earth and sin, death and hell, are not able to detain them; for <HI>Je∣sus</HI> hath gained the victory, and he gives the victory to all his chosen; and causeth them to triumph over all enemies, infernal, external, internal, and eternal. And henceforth all his children wear this motto, <HI>More than conquerors, through him that loved us.</HI></P>
<P>And as for his dominion, God the Father hath (without reserve) <HI>given all things into his hands;</HI> and he rules with despotick power over every thing in

heaven, earth, and hell. He holds all his elect in his hand, as jewels in his crown; and all other parts of the creation he holds at his command, in actual readiness to serve his church; and the subjects of sin (who are not willing that he should reign over them) he holds in chains, and makes them his footstool.—Therefore, there is no inchantment against Christ, or against his children; nor can the gates of hell pre∣vail against his church, or against any individual soul that flies to the Son of God for <HI>refuge.</HI> For he is absolute sovereign in all the creation of God, and his elect are his <HI>peculiar treasure.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>What is the age, or duration of Christ?</HI></P>
<P><HI>A.</HI> In his divine nature he is <HI>absolutely eternal;</HI> for <HI>the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost—are one. Whose name alone is</HI> JEHOVAH, <HI>the ever∣lasting God, who only hath immortality.</HI>—And the essential living God, who is self-existent, independent of all beings, the life and being of all creatures, and in himself unchangeable, must be without beginning, eternally enjoying himself, when neither sin had a be∣ing, nor any creature did <HI>exist.</HI></P>
<P>And in his human nature he is <HI>the first-born of every creature, set up from everlasting, possessed of God in the beginning of his way; the beginning of the creation of God.</HI>—These things cannot be spoken of his divine nature; whose essential perfection ad∣mits of no advancement or progression; nor can be <HI>set up,</HI> or <HI>born.</HI> Neither of the open, and actual existence of his human nature; which, so considered, is really a work of God; whereas Jehovah possessed him <HI>before his works of old.</HI> But the mystery of his will, the fellowship between the divine and human natures, or the dignity of his human nature, in union with the divine, are here intended. In which capaci∣ty he was conceived, brought forth, and set up, in the infinite mind, and eternal counsel of God; wherein
<PB N="82" REF="009151_0083_10310D1292F31300"/>
he was beheld in the perfect view of his Father, as his everlasting delight; being the very original in Jeho∣vah's grand design, and the foundation of all his works; whose purposes being unchangeable, and his decrees unfrustrable; he beholds all things imme∣diately present with himself; therefore, in the infi∣nite perfection of the divine mind, Christ stood, prior to all sin and misery.—From which unconceivable period or rather eternal duration, he was (in the same mysterious design) the head of his church; the dwel∣ling-place of his people; the inexhaustible treasury of grace; the vital fountain thro' whom all blessings flow to God's elect; who, being the image and de∣light of the Godhead, is the center of love; through whom the love of God proceeds; and in whom the Father delights in his children: for it is to be ob∣served, that the human nature of the Son of God ne∣ver was alone, but always stands in the eternal word; and all the fulness of the Godhead dwelling in him: neither is his divine nature manifested to us alone; but all his <HI>goings forth</HI> are in the woman's seed. He, therefore, was the life and glory of his people; and they were his portion and delight; the objects of his unchanging love before they became objects of wrath by sin.—And forasmuch as God, in his eternal om∣niscience, foresaw the introduction, progress, and dreadful effects of sin, he did verily foreordain before the foundation of the world, that his beloved Son should stand as mediator between God and men; that he should (according to the tenor of his suretiship) bear and iniquities of his people; that he should be their redeemer, their righteousness, and their eternal salvation; <HI>That whosoever believeth on him, should not perish, but have everlasting life.</HI> Therefore, the salvation of God's elect was secure, in Christ, be∣fore sin had so much as a <HI>conception.</HI>—And as to his continuance, in his mediatorial office, it is for-ever, unchangeable; or, 'till time shall be no more; when
<PB N="83" REF="009151_0084_10310D141BCA9020"/>
sin shall be extinct; and his whole church shall be presented, in the perfection of the Son of God, com∣pleat, without blemish, in the presence of the Fa∣ther's glory: and, from thenceforth, he shall shine in his <HI>essential glory;</HI> and his church, shall shine in his <HI>communicated glory;</HI> and he shall reign with his saints, and they with him, <HI>world without end.</HI> Amen.</P>

<HEAD>The fourth part of the question answered; or the reparation made by Christ, for the damage done by sin.</HEAD>
<P>It appears undeniable, in every description given of the monster, sin, that Christ is superior to it; and, consequently, he must be able to destroy it. And as he is the author and maintainer of the holy law (of which sin is the transgression) he is sufficient to restore the honour of his own law. And as he is not only superior to sin, but to every created being; and the essence of every creature subsists in himself; he cer∣tainly is able to distinguish, and divide, between the nature, and the putrefaction of the creature. There∣fore, he is undeniably sufficient, with respect to his own perfection, to extinguish all the mischief done by sin. The only remaining enquiry is, <HI>Whether he has done, or certainly undertaken to do it?</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Christ hath done the greatest honour to the ho∣ly law, in regard to its authority; in that he, who is the Holy One of God, became subject to it: he re∣cognized the law in all its holy commandments; and he himself is become guarantee, to see due honour done to all the precepts of it.—And he hath engaged to bring to all his people in proper subjection to it. For, tho' the word says, to believers, <HI>Ye are not under the law;</HI> the meaning cannot be, <HI>Ye are not under the obligation of it;</HI> but, <HI>Ye are not under it as a legal covenant.</HI> For all the children of God are under the law, as creatures, but not under it, as believers; be∣cause Christ has made atonement for their sin. So
<PB N="84" REF="009151_0085_10310D174C1AE468"/>
long as they remain creatures of God; they must be under his law, considered <HI>simply as a law</HI> but <HI>not as a broken law,</HI> since Christ has fulfilled it for them. They are under the <HI>commandment,</HI> but not under the <HI>curse;</HI> for Christ has redeemed them from it. They are under its <HI>direction,</HI> but not under a <HI>spirit of bondage;</HI> for Christ has made them free. So then, it is only those concomitants of the law, rela∣tive to sin, which the saints are not under; nor it is possible they should be under them, considered as be∣lievers in Jesus; for sin being taken away by Christ, there is nothing for the condemnatory part to take place upon. But, whatsoever is <HI>essential</HI> to the law itself, the heaven-born soul is under; and it is his delight so to be.</P>
<P N="2">2. Christ hath rendered ample obedience to the whole law: his whole life was perfectly conformable to every command and precept of it; he also yield∣ed obedience unto death, subjected himself to the curse, and suffered all the penalties that the sins of his people did deserve, or the just law did require.—And he hath likewise undertaken to bring all his peo∣ple to a practical obedience to the holy law.</P>
<P N="3">3. Christ hath always retained the righteousness of the law in his heart; his mind did never deviate from it; nor did any pollution ever enter his soul; but his whole nature perpetually remains an unmolested ha∣bitation of God's holy law.—And he hath engaged to put it in the hearts of his children, and to write it in their minds; and so to impress it upon their souls, that it shall abide forever. And it is the experience of God's chosen, that, by his grace, their wills are wrought into a holy conformity to the will of God.</P>
<P N="4">4. Christ hath honoured and magnified the law to the highest degree that is possible for its glory to be advance: for, whatsoever was its proper due, from creatures, has been fully rendered unto it, by him
<PB N="85" REF="009151_0086_10310D1DCC7D8E38"/>
that made all creatures.—His nature is a lively re∣presentation of the perfection of its holiness; or ra∣ther, the law is a representation of the holiness of his nature. His life was one continued course of ample conformity to all its requirements; his death was a compleat surrender of himself to its just severity; his exalted station, before the throne of God, as advocate for his people, is a continued vindication of the ho∣nour and glory of the law; inasmuch as it is his own perfect satisfaction, made to the law, which he there pleads as the justifying righteousness of his people. And, when he comes in his glory, at the great day, it will be to display the ensigns of the glory of the righteous law, by which he will judge the world.—And, in honour of this righteous Governor of the creation, Christ (by his special grace in the hearts of his children) renews and purifies them, and makes them love, desire, and rejoice in the holy law, with all their souls; and to delight in the excellencies thereof, more than in any thing they can enjoy, be∣hold, or desire, below the sun: and they shall con∣tinue to delight therein, for ever and ever.</P>
<P>Thus the honour, glory, and dignity, of this per∣fect system of rectitude, the divine law, does, and will shine much more conspicuous, through Christ, than if it had never been violated by sin.</P>
<P>And concerning the loss sustained, and ruin bro't upon mankind by sin,</P>
<P N="1">1. Christ restores, to his elect, perfect purity, and uprightness; and will perform his work in them, un∣til he has compleatly made them free from all filthi∣ness, pollution, irregularity, or depravity whatsoever; and will so perfectly <HI>finish his work,</HI> that they shall stand compleat in holiness; adequate to the ultimate perfection of the holy law, and <HI>without fault</HI> before God.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="86" REF="009151_0087_10310D1F786C03F8"/>2. Christ shall bring all his children to bear his own image; not only his image of moral rectitude, but his image of heavenly glory; and crown them with glory and honour; not only in setting them over the works of his hands, in this lower world, but in making them kings, and priests, unto God: and shall make them the most excellent of all beings; not only to exceed all things in this world, but sur∣passing all the glory of the angelick hosts, and all the dignities in the regions of light.—Thus the saints shall be raised to a dignity, far more excellent than what man possessed <HI>before his fall.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Christ is set at God's right-hand, supreme Lord and Governor of all things; not only in this world, but in the world to come. And whatsoever has an existence in the creation of God, is made subject to him. And the glory which Christ himself is possessed of, he gives to his church; and they shall reign toge∣ther with him. For he makes them victorious over all their enemies; and every thing whereby they have been led captive, shall be led captive by them: through <HI>his Spirit,</HI> they mortify their corrupt passions; through <HI>the faith of Jesus,</HI> they overcome the world; and, by <HI>the blood of the Lamb,</HI> they vanguish the prince of darkness. And, when the Captain of sal∣vation, shall have compleated his conquests, for them, and in them, they shall sit with him, as joint-heirs in his throne, and his crown shall flourish on their heads for ever.</P>
<P N="4">4. Christ is the great deliverer, who sets his chil∣dren free from every evil, and every plague: for he took upon himself their sins, and their sorrows; and in his own soul, and body, he finally bare them away from all his people. The effect whereof, will issue in their perfect freedom, from every grief, bondage, or incommodity whatsoever; and the salvation shall be eternal. Their souls shall be perfect in light;
<PB N="87" REF="009151_0088_10310D2107904B68"/>
their bodies shall be incorruptible; and whatsoever they are, do, or enjoy, shall be <HI>perpetual delight.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Christ is the alone center, and repository of all good, not only natural, but spiritual, and eternal; and all the plenitude of blessedness dwells in him, in the highest perfection; and through vital union with him, and spiritual communications from him, his chil∣dren are enriched with more exalted natures, and more enlarged capacities, than what the human nature was possessed of, before the fall. And for their ac∣commodation, he will appoint to them a kingdom, replete with all rich blessings, and abundantly stored with every good thing; which their more elevated natures can possibly enjoy, or desire. And these new enjoyments shall be free from all corruption; and all his saints shall regale themselves therein, to the <HI>days of eternity.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. Christ has already removed sin, in its condem∣ning power, from all his elect, by the blood of his cross; and, from all his called he has taken away sin, in its reinging power, by regeneration; and, in all the regenerate, he ceases not to pursue the destruc∣tion of sin, in its defiling power, by the sanctification of the Spirit; and, in all the sanctified, he will put a final period to sin, in all its appearances and conse∣quences, at his second coming.—All guilt, fear, and shame, are the effects of sin; and must necessarily cease, when the cause is taken away: therefore, the disciples of the Lord have boldness now, before the throne of grace; they have courage to confess his name, before all adversaries; and shall boldly stand before God, in the day of judgment: nothing in hea∣ven, earth, or hell, can confound their countenances, nor dismay their hearts, for <HI>Jesus is their confidence.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. Christ is the man of God's right-hand, his fel∣low, his delight, his equal, and his counsellor. He also is head over all things to this church; the husband,
<PB N="88" REF="009151_0089_103109E9884B8518"/>
the portion, the life, and glory of his chosen. The union between him and his Father, is so absolute, and indivisible, that he must inherit all his Father's per∣fections and glories; and the relation between him and his people, is so close, and inseparable, that they must partake of all his fulness and enjoyments. Therefore, in the Lord Jesus, they are made nigh to God; he dwells among them, and they dwell in his presence; all distances are removed; all interposing clouds are dispersed; and they enjoy sweet commu∣nion with JEHOVAH. Yea, he is their God, and their Father; and nothing can be able to seperate them from his love; but they shall dwell in his bo∣som for evermore.</P>
<P>Thus, through the infinite fulness of divine grace, and the mediatorial performances of EMMANUEL, there is a total extirpation of sin. Wrath is no more; death is vanguished; misery hath no place; for there is no more curse.—The honour of the divine law is amply restored, and abundantly magnified, and established, in all its rights; with the utmost excel∣lency, glory, dignity, and authority.—All that believe in Jesus, shall possess a far richer inheritance, than <HI>Adam</HI> did in Paradise: their relation to God is more near; their natures more dignified; their faculties more enlarged; their knowledge more extensive; their view of God's glory more clear; their enjoy∣ment of God more abundant; and their standing more secure.—And they shall breathe in the pure air of divine love; regale themselves in the glories of everlasting light; and bathe in the uninterrupted streams of immortality, which proceed <HI>out of the throne of God, and of the Lamb.</HI>—And songs of adoration, joy, and triumph, shall sound from all the church, and resound through all the celestial domes, to the INFINITIE, ETERNAL, THREE-ONE, <HI>world without end.</HI> Amen.</P>
