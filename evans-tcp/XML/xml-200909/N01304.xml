<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>HEBREWS XIII. 22.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Suffer the Word of Exhortation, —in a <HI>FEW WORDS.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Publick <HI>Exhortation</HI> must be at this Time, confined unto a <HI>Few words:</HI> The Time of the <HI>Year</HI> will have it so! And since I am to Discourse IN a <HI>few words,</HI> why should it be Thought Improper or Indecent, if I do it also OF a <HI>few words,</HI> and make that the <HI>Subject</HI> of my Discourse?</P>
<P>Tho' I shall not use more than a <HI>Few words</HI> be∣fore I come to my <HI>Doctrine;</HI> yet I will be guilty of so much Anticipation, as to tell you afore hand, it will be of this Importance; <HI>That a <HI>Few words</HI> may have more than Few or Small Things comprized in them.</HI></P>
<P>Ere I come to a more <HI>direct proof</HI> of that. I will first observe, an Intimation in the Text before us; That a Good <HI>Exhortation</HI> will sometimes go down the better, because there are but a <HI>Few words</HI> Employ'd upon it. <HI>Suffer the Exhortation,</HI> says the Apostle. One would think, it might have been said, <HI>Rejoyce</HI> in the <HI>Exhortation; Rejoyce</HI> that you Enjoy such an <HI>Exhortation.</HI> It seems, Peo∣ple
<PB N="2" REF="001552_0003_0FB3A311041C2F60"/>
are most unreasonably indisposed unto what would be for their <HI>Good. Exhortations</HI> that have a Tendency to make them <HI>Good,</HI> and bring them to Eternal <HI>Good,</HI> such <HI>Exhortations</HI> are a <HI>Bur∣den</HI> and a <HI>Grievance</HI> to them. Oh! the Folly, and Mischief of <HI>Sin! Original Sin,</HI> What a Depravati∣on hast thou brought upon us! Our Apostle finds out an <HI>Argument</HI> why his <HI>Exhortation</HI> should be tolerable. But there seems to be a <HI>Satyr</HI> upon Sin∣ful Mankind in the <HI>Argument.</HI> Sayes he; <HI>Tis but in Few words;</HI> Men begrutch the <HI>Time</HI> for long Exercises and Entertainments of <HI>Religion.</HI> Brave Husbands of their <HI>Time!</HI> Of their <HI>Time,</HI> Two or Three Hours at a Time, can go well enough to meer Impertinencies; but <HI>One Hour</HI> in the <HI>Service</HI> of God; This is a <HI>Suffering.</HI> How many <HI>Hours</HI> of <HI>Ʋseless Conversation</HI> with a Friend are well e∣nough! But <HI>One Hour</HI> to converse with GOD; This is to <HI>Suffer</HI> Egregiously. An Hour or Two at the <HI>Table</HI> is well enough; A <HI>Quarter of an Hour</HI> in the <HI>Closet,</HI> This is an Hardship, and hardly to be <HI>Suffered.</HI> Rather <HI>a Thousand Dayes Elsewhere,</HI> than One in the <HI>Courts of the Lord;</HI> Notable Re∣deemers of <HI>Time</HI> indeed! Well, The affairs of Re∣ligion, are, it seems, to be Recommended unto the Children of Men, because they may be dis∣patched in a <HI>Few words</HI> in a very Little Time. I confess, I do not think, this is much for the <HI>Honour</HI> of the <HI>World!</HI></P>
<P>But then, I see Something that may be for the <HI>Honour</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> and of them that handle the affairs of it. It was alwayes thought an <HI>Honourable</HI>
<PB N="3" REF="001552_0004_0FB3A3128266CEA0"/>
Thing. <HI>To say much in a Little,</HI> I need not quote <HI>Euripides</HI> or <HI>Menander</HI> for it. You shall find, They that write the <HI>Maxims of Prudence,</HI> will all tell you, <HI>There is no greater sign of Wit, and Sense, than to say much in a Little.</HI></P>
<P>So did our Apostle. His <HI>Epistle to the Hebrews,</HI> is but a <HI>Short</HI> Epistle; it has but a <HI>Few words.</HI> But there is a <HI>Great Deal</HI> in it. It is full of <HI>Mysteries.</HI> It is an admirable <HI>System of the Christian Religion.</HI> There never was a <HI>Richer Composure</HI> seen upon the Face of the Earth. When <HI>Four Excellent Volumns in Folio,</HI> coming after a Library of other Exposi∣tors, have search'd out the Truths contained in it, there is work yet left for more than as many more. <HI>More Treasures</HI> are still behind; unspeakably more▪ So that I can obtain this <HI>Doctrine</HI> for you;</P>
<P><HI>That much may be said in a <HI>Few words.</HI></HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Few words</HI> may have abundance of <HI>matter</HI> in them. A <HI>Few Drops</HI> of Expression, may have an <HI>Ocean</HI> of matter in them.</P>
<P>We will in a <HI>Few words</HI> proceed unto the De∣monstration of it.</P>
<P N="1">I. The Great God has in a <HI>Few words</HI> com∣prized all the <HI>Duty,</HI> that He has required of us. The <HI>Duty</HI> that we Owe to our God, it is very sure, as there is <HI>much</HI> depends on it; <HI>Eternity</HI> depends on it! So, there is very <HI>much</HI> belongs to it. Well, But as <HI>much</HI> as our <HI>Duty</HI> is, I can carry you, where you shall see a <HI>Few words</HI> containing of it.</P>
<P>In the first Place; <HI>Ten Words</HI> are a <HI>Few Words.</HI> Now All our <HI>Duty</HI> is compriz<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d in <HI>Ten Words;</HI> You know what I mean; The
<PB N="4" REF="001552_0005_0FB3A31400B175B0"/>
Law of the <HI>Ten Commandments.</HI> The old <HI>Romans</HI> had a famous Instrument among them, called, <HI>The Law of the Twelve Tribes.</HI> They sent Embassadors unto foreign Countrys, to bring home an Account, and a Copy of their <HI>Wisest Laws.</HI> Then they Employ'd a Number of their <HI>Wisest Men,</HI> to Digest and Compile a <HI>Body of Laws</HI> out of these. The Extract, which was a long while in making, was called, <HI>The Twelve Tables.</HI> When it was done, their Orators admired it for its Excellencies; but especially for the, <HI>Mira Verborum concinnitas;</HI> its admirable Expressiveness; its Expressing in a <HI>Few Words,</HI> the Greatest and Bravest Things that ever were uttered. And yet, we have reco∣vered about an Hundred Laws that were in it; Many of them <HI>Foolish▪</HI> many <HI>Trifling,</HI> many <HI>Wick∣ed</HI> Ones! Our <HI>Law of the Two Tables,</HI> does as much Exceed their <HI>Law of the Twelve Tables,</HI> as the <HI>Sun</HI> does Exceed a <HI>Gloworm.</HI> In these <HI>Few Words,</HI> Oh, how much is contained! Well might the Man of God say, Psal. CXIX. 96 <HI>Thy Commandment is Exceeding Broad</HI> Mind the <HI>Rules of Explication</HI> for these <HI>Few Words,</HI> and you will presently be sensible of it</P>
<P>Remember▪ first; That <HI>the Law is Spiritual;</HI> It reaches to the <HI>Spirit;</HI> it calls for the Obedience of the <HI>Inward Man,</HI> as well as of the <HI>Outward Man.</HI></P>
<P>Remember secondly; That when a <HI>Duty</HI> is Commanded▪ the contrary <HI>Sin</HI> is Forbidden; and when a <HI>Sin</HI> is Forbidden, the contrary <HI>Duty</HI> is commanded.</P>
<P>Remember, thirdly, That when any <HI>One Duty</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="001552_0006_0FB3A315726C3400"/>
is Commanded, and when any <HI>One Sin</HI> is Forbid∣den, all others of the <HI>Same kind</HI> are also Command∣ed and Forbidden.</P>
<P>Remember, fourthly; That when any <HI>Duty</HI> is Commanded, all the <HI>Helps</HI> and all the <HI>Signs</HI> of such a Duty are also Commanded: And when any <HI>Sin</HI> is Forbidden, all the <HI>Causes,</HI> and all the <HI>Occa∣sions,</HI> and all the <HI>Appearances</HI> of such a Sin are also forbidden.</P>
<P>Remember, lastly; Tis Exacted &amp; Expected, that we are not only to keep the Law <HI>our selves,</HI> but also do all we can, and use all <HI>Good Means, that others</HI> may keep it.</P>
<P>Now say, Is not this <HI>Commandment Exceeding Bread?</HI> And have not a <HI>Few Words</HI> Excee∣ding much Comprized in them? Truly, <HI>Brevius nihil est, nec Plenius istis.</HI> —</P>
<P>Here we ought to make a Pause; and in a <HI>Few Words</HI> describe a <HI>Confession,</HI> which we must all now be necessarily obliged unto.</P>
<P><HI>Confess,</HI> That your have not kept this <HI>Law;</HI> You are daily breaking of it: <HI>In many things we offend all. Confess,</HI> That your Transgressions of this Law cannot be Numbred; <HI>Who can understand his Errors? Confess,</HI> That your <HI>Justification</HI> by your <HI>own Righteousness,</HI> is for ever to be despaired of. But then, <HI>Pitty.</HI> Pitty those Deluded Creatures, who have not <HI>Seen an End of all Perfection;</HI>— but Imagine themselves arrived unto a <HI>Sinless Perfecti∣on.</HI> Unto their Proud <HI>Assembly,</HI> my Soul, <HI>Be not thou Ʋnited!</HI></P>
<P>I have shown you a <HI>World</HI> of <HI>Duty,</HI> yea, the
<PB N="6" REF="001552_0007_0FB3A318F71DECA0"/>
<HI>whole</HI> of our <HI>Duty,</HI> comprized in <HI>Ten Words.</HI> Well, but I will show it you in <HI>Three Words. <HI>Three</HI></HI> are not <HI>Many. Tribus Verbis,</HI> was an ancient Proverb for the greatest <HI>Brevity</HI> imaginable In so <HI>Few Words</HI> you have it; Mic. VI 8. <HI>He hath shewed thee, O Man, the Good Thing. And what doth the Lord require of thee, but to Do Justice, and to Love Mercy, and to Walk Humbly with thy God?</HI></P>
<P>More Briefly yet▪ I will show it you in <HI>Two Words. <HI>Two Words</HI></HI> are but <HI>Few Words.</HI> But now, what think you of those <HI>Two Words?</HI> Matt. XXII 37.— 40 <HI>Thou shalt Love the Lord thy God, with all thy Heart, and with all thy Soul, and with all thy Mind. This is the First and Great Command∣ment. And the Second is like unto it; Thou shalt Love thy Neighbour as thy self. On these two Com∣mandments hang all the Law, and the Prophets.</HI> How much, how much do these <HI>Two Words</HI> carry in them! The very same, and it is a very <HI>In∣structive Hint</HI> that I give you, when I tell you, tis the <HI>very same!</HI> — You have, 1 Joh III. 23 <HI>This is His Commandment, That we should Believe on the Name of His Son</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>and Love One another, as He gave us Commandment.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, What if I should show you, where tis all comprised in <HI>One Word?</HI> I can do <HI>that!</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> have a saying That there are <HI>Six hundred and thirteen</HI> precepts in the <HI>Law;</HI> but that they are all reduced into that one Sentence; <HI>Heb.</HI> II. 4. <HI>The Just by his Faith shall live.</HI> There is a World of <HI>Christianity</HI> in that saying of theirs. There is much, much of the <HI>Gospel</HI> in it!</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001552_0008_0FB3A31A9B3AF280"/>I can give another Instance of such an <HI>Compre∣hensive Sentence.</HI> Tis that <HI>Golden Rule</HI> of our Savi∣our; Matth. VII. 12. <HI>All things whatsoever ye would, that men should do unto you, Do ye even so un∣to them.</HI> A <HI>Rule</HI> acknowledged among the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> have it in their <HI>Talmuds.</HI> Tis also in the <HI>Apocrypha.</HI> Among the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> the Moral Writers cry it up, an Army of them. One of the <HI>Emperors</HI> had it in his mouth continu∣ally; and made the Officers of the Empire put it into publick Proclamations. But, Oh; how <HI>Ex∣tensive</HI> in this Glorious <HI>Rule!</HI> First; All the <HI>Duty</HI> we owe to one another, is comprised in these <HI>Few Words.</HI> In all our <HI>Business,</HI> these <HI>Few Words,</HI> will Suggest <HI>All</HI> that we have to do. And in the <HI>Relations</HI> that we sustain, do but mind these <HI>Few Words,</HI> and our carriage will be marvellously Regulated, you will find it marvellously applica∣ble to the Government of all your <HI>Actions,</HI> and all your <HI>Passions.</HI> Yea, Upon further Thoughts, I find this <HI>Rule of Reason</HI> Extendible beyond what I at first imagined Our <HI>Duty</HI> towards our <HI>Creator</HI> may from this very <HI>Rule,</HI> receive some Direction, For if <HI>we</HI> had power to <HI>Create,</HI> we should certain∣ly demand from <HI>our Creatures,</HI> all the Love, all the Honour, all the Service imaginable.</P>
<P>I will only add, You all know, our Lord gave his Disciples a <HI>Platform of Prayer,</HI> which in a <HI>Few Words</HI> does contain the whole matter of all our <HI>Prayers.</HI> Our <HI>Prayers</HI> may ask nothing of <HI>Our Fa∣ther who is in the Heavens,</HI> (for so the first clause ought to be translated,) but what this Exquisite
<PB N="8" REF="001552_0009_0FB3A31B92572508"/>
<HI>Platform</HI> allowes and contains. It contains be∣yond <HI>all that we can ask or think!</HI></P>
<P>I will in a <HI>Few Words,</HI> yea, in <HI>One Word,</HI> give you the <HI>Reason</HI> for this <HI>Abbreviation of our Duty.</HI> Our Gracious God, has had <HI>Compassion</HI> on our Frail and Weak Faculties in this <HI>Abbreviation:</HI> Particularly, on the <HI>Frailty</HI> and <HI>Weakness</HI> of our <HI>Memories.</HI> We can't <HI>Remember</HI> more than a <HI>Few Words.</HI> Our <HI>Duty</HI> must be given us in a <HI>Few Words,</HI> that it may be the more Easily <HI>Remembred</HI> with us. If it be not <HI>Remembred</HI> it will not be <HI>Practised.</HI> I Remember a notable Word; Rom. IX. 28. <HI>The work, He will cut it short in Righteous∣ness.</HI> Some understand it of, <HI>The Gospel. The Gos∣pel</HI> is that <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, that <HI>Abbreviated word.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> was Tedious: It had a <HI>Multipli∣city</HI> of observances. But our Lord JESUS CHRIST comes, with a more <HI>Compendious work,</HI> and requires none of those <HI>Long Ʋndertakings.</HI> One of the Ancients tells us, By the <HI>Short Word</HI> here, is meant, that <HI>Short word of Faith;</HI> Act. XVI. 31. <HI>Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be Saved.</HI> God has thus in <HI>Righteousness,</HI> and with a sweet <HI>Kindness</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> considered our Ca∣pacities.</P>
<P>Having offered you this Intimation, I will offer you a very <HI>Short</HI> Inference and <HI>Instruction</HI> from it.</P>
<P>Certainly, we may in Like manner <HI>Consider the Capacities</HI> of those that are under <HI>our Instruction.</HI></P>
<P>It is possible, we have poor Stupid Abject <HI>Ne∣gro's</HI> under our Charge. Oh! Remember the <HI>Ac∣count</HI> you must give to the Glorious Lord, about
<PB N="9" REF="001552_0010_0FB3A31D87539C40"/>
the <HI>Souls</HI> of those poor <HI>Negro's</HI> You complain, you can't make them Learn. Well, But in three short Questions well answered, you may have al∣most the whole <HI>Body of Divinity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Who Made you and all the World?</HI></P>
<P><HI>The Great</HI> GOD <HI>Made me to Serve Him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Who Saves the Children of Men from all their Miseries?</HI></P>
<P>JESUS CHRIST, <HI>who is both God and Man, Saves them that Look unto Him</HI></P>
<P><HI>What will become of you when you Dye?</HI></P>
<P><HI>If I Obey</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>my Soul will go to the Heavenly Paradise; and He will afterwards Raise me from the Dead. If I continue Wicked, I shall be cast among the Devils.</HI></P>
<P>It must be an extraordinary <HI>Sottishness</HI> indeed, if the Learning of these <HI>Three Short Questions</HI> can't be infused into them.</P>
<P>And thus, our <HI>Children.</HI> We may betimes get a whole <HI>Body of Divinity</HI> into their Little Souls. We are furnished with <HI>Abridgments</HI> of it. The <HI>A∣brigments</HI> we have in our <HI>Hands,</HI> may be soon get into their <HI>Minds.</HI> Yea, Sometimes <HI>one Text</HI> in the Bible, has <HI>All</HI> in it. Such an <HI>Epitome</HI> of Christi∣anity, we have in the <HI>Sixteenth Verse,</HI> of the III
<PB N="10" REF="001552_0011_0FB3A31E8924ED58"/>
Chapter of <HI>John.</HI> You have it again <HI>Epitomized</HI> in the <HI>Eleventh, Twelfth, Thirteenth, &amp; Fourteenth Verses,</HI> of the II Chapter to <HI>Titus.</HI> To teach them these would admirably Fortify them all their Dayes, against the <HI>Error of the Wicked. Plutarch</HI> ingeniously compares this <HI>brief way</HI> of Teaching our Children, unto the Mothers fastening with a <HI>Girdle</HI> about them, the Fruits wherewith she fur¦nishes them. I Leave the matter with your Con∣sideration.</P>
<P N="2">II. I have yet a <HI>Few Words</HI> more to say There are <HI>Mysteries</HI> uttered in the <HI>Oracles</HI> of God; vast <HI>Mysteries,</HI> contained in a <HI>Few Words</HI> very <HI>Concisely</HI> uttered. The Great Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> having Written the Two Short Chapters that be∣gin his Epistle to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> then sayes, Eph. III. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 4. <HI>I have wrote a few words, whereby when ye read, you may understand my Knowledge in the Mystery of Christ.</HI> In a <HI>Few Words,</HI> you shall have a <HI>Mystery</HI> given you, which you shall spend all your Dayes upon, before you comprehend all that is in it; nay it will afford you fresh Matter of contemplation to Eternal Ages. There is <HI>one Text</HI> in our Book of Life; 'tis in the <HI>Beginning</HI> of the Book of God; and a very <HI>Short</HI> one it is. Tis that, Gen. III. 15. <HI>I will put Enmity between thee and the Woman, and between thy Seed, and her Seed; It shall bruise thy Head, and thou shalt bruise His Heel.</HI> But a <HI>Few Words!</HI> And yet, all the <HI>Bible</HI> is but a commentary on those <HI>Few Words.</HI> That rich Ingot of <HI>Gold,</HI> is beaten out, so as to make all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the Bible. Yea, it would
<PB N="11" REF="001552_0012_0FB3A320DE03F5C0"/>
bear a <HI>Beating out,</HI> into more Volumns, than there are in a <HI>Vatican,</HI> or a <HI>Bodleian</HI> Library. It is a wondrous Thing, that we find out by our <HI>mi∣croscopes.</HI> In a little Body, more than a thousand times smaller than a Grain of Sand, there lye folded up, all the parts of a <HI>Plant,</HI> or of an <HI>Ani∣mal,</HI> which are afterwards Evolved and Extended, unto mighty Dimensions. Methinks, That Illustrious Text in <HI>Genesis,</HI> may be compared unto such a little Body. It may be drawn forth into Thousands of admirable Sermons The <HI>Fa∣thers</HI> of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> were always Preaching on it, for Four Thousand years together. But the Subject is not Exhausted; we their Children are to this Day still upon it: still hanging on, still drawing at, that <HI>Breast of Consolation.</HI></P>
<P>There is that <HI>Mystery;</HI> 1 Joh V 7 <HI>There are Three who testify in Heaven, The Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit; and these Three are One.</HI> It is comprised in a <HI>Few Words.</HI></P>
<P>There is that <HI>Mystery;</HI> 1 Tim. III. 16 <HI>Great is the Mystery of Godliness, God manifest in Flesh.</HI> It is comprised in a <HI>Few Words.</HI></P>
<P>But verily, There is more in these <HI>Few Words,</HI> than all the Men on Earth can grasp; Yea, more than can be grasped by all the Angels in Heaven; Yea, tho' they Study Millions of Ages upon it.</P>
<P>There is the <HI>Baptismal Covenant,</HI> which we are generally brought into. [Matth. XXVIII 19▪] To take the Great <HI>God,</HI> who is the <HI>Father,</HI> and the <HI>Son,</HI> and the <HI>Spirit,</HI> for our <HI>God,</HI> and <HI>Portion;</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="001552_0013_0FB3A322FB0B3430"/>
Wonderful, Wonderful Things are comprehend∣ed it. O <HI>Baptised</HI> Ones, Think what you are obliged unto; Think what will be done for you, if you are mindful of your Obligations! O you that lay Hold on the <HI>Covenant,</HI> Think what you do, when these <HI>Few Words</HI> are offer'd you!</P>
<P>There are the <HI>Benefits</HI> of our Great Saviour Proposed unto us in a <HI>Few Words;</HI> 1 Cor. I. 30. <HI>Ye are in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Holiness, and Re∣demption.</HI> Christian, Meditate all thy Dayes on those <HI>Few Words;</HI> Thou wilt never fetch out all the <HI>Sweetness,</HI> all the <HI>Goodness,</HI> all the <HI>Glory</HI> of those <HI>Few Words.</HI> All the Dayes of <HI>Methu∣selah,</HI> would not suffice to do it in.</P>
<P>Tis only a <HI>Scriptural Demonstration,</HI> which I have hitherto given you, That <HI>much</HI> may be said in a <HI>Few Words.</HI> And such is the most <HI>Suitable Demonstration;</HI> for a <HI>Preacher</HI> who would <HI>Seek out Acceptable Words.</HI> But then, for a more <HI>General Demonstration,</HI> I need only refer you to the <HI>Rules of Implication</HI> One Thing will <HI>Imply</HI> many Things. A <HI>Few Words</HI> will have many, many <HI>Things</HI> in them, if the <HI>Rules of Implication</HI> be duely attended unto; And <HI>Wise Men</HI> will use to attend unto them. The words of <HI>Wise Men</HI> have sometimes been called.<HI>Golden Words.</HI> In <HI>Gold,</HI> much lies in a <HI>Little Room. Gold</HI> may be so drawn out, that on Guilded Wire of Silver the hundred thousandth part of a Grain of it, shall be visible to the Naked Eye. Such <HI>Golden Words</HI> may be Spoken, that when they
<PB N="13" REF="001552_0014_0FB3A32472E73830"/>
are drawn out by the <HI>Rules of Implications,</HI> they may reach further than could have been ima∣gined. There was a sort of <HI>Sentences,</HI> that of old were called <HI>Laconisms.</HI> The Wise men of the Time and Place chose to Speak <HI>Laconically.</HI> They were very <HI>Sententious.</HI> They gave a De∣monstration, <HI>That much may be Spoken in a <HI>Few Words.</HI></HI> I do not know, why this may not be Practised among other People, as well as the <HI>Lacedaemonians.</HI> You Know, <HI>Vir Sapit;</HI> A <HI>Wise</HI> man will <HI>Speak Little;</HI> but still much more <HI>Wise</HI> he that will <HI>Speak much in a Little.</HI></P>
<P>But in a <HI>Few Words,</HI> Let a Two-fold <HI>Ex∣hortation</HI> arrive unto us.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> The <HI>Art</HI> and <HI>Skill</HI> of Expressing our selves in a <HI>Few Words,</HI> especially on Some Occasi∣ons; Let this be more Studied; The <HI>Folly</HI> of using <HI>too many Words,</HI> Let this be Disliked, be Avoided.</P>
<P>It is first, in our <HI>Devotions,</HI> that such a Study must be maintained. In our <HI>Prayers,</HI> there is especially One sort of Words, which we should beware of having too many of them. <HI>Vowes</HI> are such Words. Take heed, Sirs, of having too many such. Thus we are advised, Eccl V. 2. <HI>Let not thy Heart be hasty to utter any Word be∣fore God; Let thy Words be Few.</HI></P>
<P>Our Saviour has also left another Caution with us; That we should not think, our <HI>Prayers</HI> will find the more Acceptance with Hea∣ven, because of <HI>Many Words</HI> used in them.
<PB N="14" REF="001552_0015_0FB3A3260EBADFC0"/>
He has cautioned us; Matth. VI. 7. <HI>When ye Pray, use not Vain Repetitions, as the Heathen do; for they think, they shall be heard for their much Speaking.</HI></P>
<P>I will add; Tho' there may be Occasion for us to be <HI>Long at Prayer;</HI> yet for a man to use <HI>Tautologies</HI> in his Prayer; to use <HI>many Words,</HI> and come with one thing over and over, on purpose to Spin out the Prayer; This is <HI>to take the Name of the Lord thy God in Vain!</HI></P>
<P>One thing more; We should not Slubber and Hurry over our <HI>Family-Prayers.</HI> They should be made, as by Men, who do not know, but that <HI>this is the Last Prayer that over they shall make in this World!</HI> Think so, my Friend, when Kneeling down with thy <HI>Family.</HI> Yet it is for the most part an Inconvenient Thing, to make those <HI>Prayers</HI> very <HI>Long</HI> ones. It may be no Service to the Interests of Piety in the Family. In a word, <HI>Chrysostom</HI> observes it unto us, That CHRIST and <HI>Paul,</HI> commands us, to make our Prayers, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Short and Frequent. Cassianus</HI> mentions it, as the U∣niversal consent of the Antients; <HI>Ʋtilius cen∣sent, Breves Orationes, sed Creberrimas fieri:</HI> They thought it best, to <HI>Pray Briefly;</HI> but <HI>Very Often, Very Often,</HI> to be Engaged in it.</P>
<P>But then, We are to Watch against the <HI>Folly</HI> of <HI>Talking too much</HI> in all our <HI>Conversation.</HI> Especially, when the <HI>Errors</HI> of other People, are to be taxed, or when we are to Express our <HI>Displeasure,</HI> and <HI>Resentment</HI> of their Miscarriages
<PB N="15" REF="001552_0016_0FB3A327ABFDC7A0"/>
towards our selves; You are not ignorant of a common Aphorism, <HI>The least said is soonest mended.</HI> And thus, to Talk of ones <HI>own Self,</HI> or <HI>Family,</HI> here, a <HI>Nimietas in dicendo,</HI> the Fault which <HI>Epictetus</HI> decried; if we go beyond a very <HI>Few Words,</HI> a Fault is fallen into. But at all times, <HI>Talkative</HI> People, or People of <HI>many Words,</HI> do very much Expose themselves. They proclame their own <HI>Folly,</HI> to those, who if they had <HI>held their Peace,</HI> might have thought them <HI>Wise. In multiloquio Stultiloquium.</HI> Those Foolish and Wordy and Windy People, often impose upon the Company. They are guilty of <HI>Ill Manners;</HI> They do what will not be done <HI>by a Sober Guest</HI> It is true, <HI>From the A∣bundance of the Heart, the Mouth Speaketh.</HI> But if there be <HI>Abundance</HI> of <HI>Speech</HI> in the <HI>Mouth,</HI> it often showes, that there is not <HI>Abundance</HI> of <HI>Sense</HI> in the <HI>Heart:</HI> No, but that <HI>Folly</HI> is <HI>bound up</HI> there; <HI>Abundance</HI> of that! But where shall I find a <HI>Bridle</HI> for these <HI>Impertinencies?</HI> The Stores of <HI>Solomon</HI> will afford us One; Prov. X. 19. <HI>In the Multitude of Words, there wanteth not Sin; but he that refraineth his Lips, is Wise.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> What remains, is to bespeak your <HI>Me∣ditation,</HI> Your Serious, and Frequent <HI>Meditati∣on,</HI> on those Passages, especially of the <HI>Sacred Scripture,</HI> which will in a <HI>Few Words</HI> lay Many and Weighty Things before you Oh! Bestow more than a <HI>Few Thoughts</HI> upon them!</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="001552_0017_0FB3A3292188AFB0"/>The <HI>Stewards</HI> in the House of God, will Endeavour, not out of <HI>Slothfulness,</HI> but out of <HI>Discretion,</HI> at all times to <HI>Limit</HI> their Dispen∣sations, and at some times very Sensibly to <HI>Shorten</HI> them T'wil be discretely done of them, so to Measure their Sermons, that no Wise Hearer shall say, <HI>What a weariness is it? When shall it be over?</HI> But rather, that it shall be said of them, as it was of the famous Orator, <HI>Pertimescebamus ne desineret;</HI> Or, <HI>T'were to have been wish'd he had not done so soon!</HI> Indeed <HI>Long Sermons</HI> have sometimes been so full, and so warm, that the Hearer sayes, <HI>He could glad∣ly have Sat an Hour Longer!</HI> And, <HI>Non sunt Longa quibus nihil est quod demere posses.</HI> But <HI>short Sermons</HI> are sometimes needful for the <HI>Preachers,</HI> that will not over-do. The Rule for us is, <HI>Quiquid Praecipies esto Brevis.</HI> They will call to mind what <HI>Elihu</HI> said, <HI>Suffer me a Little, and I will shew what I have to speak on God's behalf.</HI> They will not make the Mes∣sages of Heaven <HI>Tedious</HI> and <HI>Irksome.</HI> They will Stand but a <HI>Little while</HI> in delivering of them, when either Severe <HI>Cold,</HI> or Extreme <HI>Heat,</HI> shall render it uneasy to attend upon them. They will be of <HI>Paulinus</HI>'s Opinion; <HI>Brevis Sermo, Dulcedinem simul et Vigorem verbi <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>estis tenet;</HI> That is to say, <HI>Short and Sweet.</HI></P>
<P>In conformity to this Maxim, I will now address the Auditory with a most <HI>Various Applica∣tion,</HI> but in as <HI>Few Words</HI> as can be imagined.</P>
<Q><PB N="17" REF="001552_0018_0FB3A32A7253CA00"/>Sensus Divitias Verbi Brevitate Coarctans.</Q>
<P>First; O Unregenerates, The <HI>Misery</HI> of your <HI>Ʋnregenerate State</HI> is to be set before you. It shall be done in a <HI>Few Words.</HI> Ah, Mise∣rables, Take those <HI>Few Words</HI> into your Meditation; Eph. II. 1, 2 3. <HI>Dead in Trespasses and Sins; Walking according to the Course of this World, and according to the Spirit which works in the Children of Disobedience: fulfilling the Desires of the Flesh and of the Mind; and by Nature Children of Wrath.</HI> Oh! What a <HI>Black Sea of Death,</HI> have these <HI>Few Words</HI> thrown you into! Think of them; or Think of these <HI>Few Words; <HI>What am I doing?</HI></HI> And, <HI>Where am I going?</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; We must now in a <HI>Few Words</HI> tell these Poor <HI>Slaves</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Hell,</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Death,</HI> What they shall do to be <HI>Saved.</HI> O Take into your Meditation those <HI>Few Words,</HI> Mark XVI. 16 <HI>He that believeth shall be Saved.</HI> The meaning of those <HI>Few Words</HI> is This. Feel your selves <HI>Wretched;</HI> See your selves <HI>Ʋnable</HI> to get out of your fearful Wretchedness. Own your selves <HI>Ʋn∣worthy</HI> that God should help you to get out. Behold a <HI>Saviour</HI> provided for you. Cry to God for <HI>Help</HI> to Embrace that <HI>Only Saviour.</HI> Plead the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> of your Saviour, that your Sin may be Pardoned. Plead the <HI>Righteousness</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="001552_0019_0FB3A32C376BED60"/>
of your Saviour, that you may have a Title to Life. Resign your selves up to the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> of your Saviour, that He may Enlighten you, and Purify you, and Rectify you, and fit you for, and bring you to, the Heavenly World. In these <HI>Few Words</HI> You have <HI>All!</HI> That <HI>One Word,</HI> REPENTANCE, has a great deal, Oh! a great deal intended in it. Sinners, Tis more than a meer Crying out, <HI>Lord, Have Mercy upon me.</HI> But this <HI>One Word,</HI> and all that is in it, must be complied withal, by all that would find Mercy with God.</P>
<P>But then, Thirdly; In a <HI>Few Words</HI> we are to show the Believer, What <HI>Life</HI> he is to Lead; How he is to <HI>Live,</HI> that he may <HI>Dye</HI> with Safety and Comfort. Oh! Let your Me∣ditation be much on those <HI>Few Words;</HI> Eccl. XII. 13.14 <HI>Let us hear the Conclusion</HI> [and so, the Contraction] <HI>of the whole Matter; Fear God, and Keep His Commandments; For God shall bring every work into Judgment.</HI> Or, Take it in <HI>Other Words;</HI> and those not very <HI>many</HI> nei∣ther. Spend your <HI>Time</HI> now, as those that must give an <HI>Account</HI> unto God how you have Spent it. <HI>Now</HI> do nothing, that you may justly ap∣prehend will be Condemned in the <HI>Day of Judg∣ment. Now</HI> do every thing, that you may be justly apprehensive will in the <HI>Day of Judgment</HI> be Rewarded. <HI>Now</HI> employ all your <HI>Talents,</HI> as Knowing, that in the <HI>Day of Judgment,</HI> You
<PB N="19" REF="001552_0020_0FB3A32DD45CAD50"/>
must be Accountable for them. Or, if you would have all the <HI>Rules of Holy Living</HI> in <HI>One Word.</HI> Even <HI>So</HI> you shall have them; and that <HI>One Word</HI> shall be this; <HI>Live always as in the Presence of God;</HI> and, <HI>Act as having the Eye of God always upon you.</HI></P>
<P>Fourthly. Many People are under <HI>Discourage∣ments,</HI> about the Guilt of their Sins; Discou∣raged with Fears that the <HI>Day of Grace</HI> is over with them; Or, perhaps, that they have <HI>Sinn'd Ʋnpardonably.</HI> I will take away all their Dis∣couragements, with a <HI>Few Words.</HI> They shall be those; Joh. VI. 37. <HI>Him that cometh to me, I will in no wise cast out.</HI> Ah, Discouraged Souls; These <HI>Few Words</HI> from the Mouth of a Lovely JESUS; They are Enough to Si∣lence all your Objections. A SAVIOUR: An Able and a Willing <HI>Saviour;</HI> O all <HI>Flesh,</HI> be Silent before Him.</P>
<P>Fifthly. There are many <HI>Afflictions</HI> which our Neighbours Encounter withal. I will direct them in a <HI>Few Words,</HI> how to Behave them∣selves. They are those, Heb. XII 5 <HI>My Son, Despise not thou the Chastning of the Lord; nor Faint when Rebuked of Him.</HI> Or, in <HI>Other Words</HI> of the like Importance; <HI>Think whom thy Afflictions come from; Think what thy Afflictions come for; And be more Studious to Get Good by thy Afflictions, than to get out of thy Afflictions.</HI> The famous Two Words of <HI>Epictetus,</HI> which were <HI>Sustine
<PB N="20" REF="001552_0021_0FB3A32F4899D7E0"/>
ot Abstine;</HI> that is, <HI>Bear,</HI> and, <HI>Forbear;</HI> were not more important ones.</P>
<P>Finally; My Hearers; If you Sleight the <HI>Few Words</HI> in which you have the Holy Counsils of God, Let a <HI>Few Words</HI> tell you the Issue of it. Those words; Phil. III. 19. <HI>Their End is Destruction, who Mind Earthly Things.</HI> But if you Entertain these <HI>Few Words</HI> with a due Affection and Obedience, a <HI>Few Words</HI> will tell you the Issue of that also. Those words; Jam. I 25. <HI>A Door of the work, this man shall be Blessed in his Deed.</HI> SALVATION, is but <HI>One Word;</HI> Yet, my Friend, it contains all that an Immortal Soul can wish for And it is all Thine, if thou hearken to the <HI>Few Words</HI> in the <HI>Glorious Gospel of God.</HI></P>
<P>I know, You Expect I should observe a <HI>Decorum,</HI> and not at this Time use <HI>Many words.</HI> These <HI>Few Words</HI> may be sufficient, for the present Exercise, May the Grace of God ac∣company them!</P>
