<HEAD>An <HI>ACT</HI> for the better Ordering and Regulating such as are willing and de∣sirous to be united for military Purposes within this Province.</HEAD>
<P><HI><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>hereas</HI> this Province was first settled by, and a Majority of the Assemblies have ever since been of, the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> who, though they do not, as the World is now circumstanced, condemn the Use of Arms in others, yet are principled against bearing Arms themselves; and to make any Law to compel them thereto, against their Consciences, would not only be to violate a Fundamental in our Constitution, and be a direct Breach of our Charter of Privileges, but would also, in Effect, be to commence Persecution against all that Part of the Inhabitants of the Province; and for them, by any Law, to compel others to bear Arms, and exempt themselves, would be inconsistent and partial; yet, foras∣much as by the general Toleration, and Equity of our Laws, great Numbers of People of other religious Denominations are come among us, who are under no such Restraint, some of whom have been disciplined in the Art of War, and conscientiously think it their Duty to fight in Defence of their Country, their Wives, their Families, and Estates; and such have an equal Right to Liberty of Conscience with others;</P>
<P><HI>And whereas</HI> a great Number of Petitions from the several Counties of this Pro∣vince have been presented to this House, setting forth, That the Petitioners are very willing to defend themselves and their Country, and desirous of being formed into regular Bodies for that Purpose, instructed and disciplined under proper Officers with suitable and legal Authority; representing withal, that unless Measures of this kind are taken, so as to unite them together, subject them to due Command, and thereby give them Confidence in each other, they cannot assemble to oppose the Enemy, without the utmost Danger of exposing themselves to Confusion and Destruction:</P>
<P><HI>And whereas</HI> the voluntary assembling of great Bodies of armed Men, from dif∣ferent Parts of this Province, on any occasional Alarm, whether true or false, as of
<PB N="2" REF="040861_0002_101910F596C19790"/>late hath happened, without Call or Authority from the Government, and without due Order and Direction among themselves, may be attended with Danger to our neighbouring <HI>Indian</HI> Friends and Allies, as well as to the internal Peace of the Province:</P>
<P><HI>And whereas</HI> the Governor hath frequently recommended it to the Assembly, that, in preparing and passing a Law for such Purposes, they should have a due Re∣gard to scrupulous and tender Consciences; which cannot be done where compulsive Means are used to force Men into military Service:</P>
<P><HI>Therefore,</HI> as we represent all the People of the Province, and are composed of Mem∣bers of different religious Persuasions, we do not think it reasonable that any should, thro' a Want of legal Powers, be in the least restrained from doing what they judge it their Duty to do for their own Security, and the Publick Good; We, in Compliance with the said Petitions and Recommendations, do offer it to the Governor to be <HI>Enacted; And be it Enacted</HI> by the Honourable <HI>Robert Hunter Morris,</HI> Esquire, with the KING's Royal Approbation, Lieutenant-Governor under the Honourable <HI>Thomas Penn</HI> and <HI>Richard Penn,</HI> Esquires, true and absolute Proprietors of the Province of <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> and of the Counties of <HI>Newcastle, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Sussex,</HI> upon <HI>Delaware,</HI> by and with the Advice and Consent of the Representatives of the Freemen of the said Province, in General Assembly met, and by the Authority of the same, That, from and after the Publica∣tion of this Act, it shall and may be lawful for the Freemen of this Province to form themselves into Companies, as heretofore they have used in Time of War without Law; and for each Company, by Majority of Votes, in the Way of Ballot, to chuse its own Officers; to wit, a Captain, Lieutenant, and Ensign, and present them to the Governor or Commander in Chief, for the Time being, for his Approbation; which Officers so chosen, if approved and commissioned by him, shall be the Captain, Lieutenant, and Ensign, of each Company respectively, according to their Commis∣sions; and the said Companies being divided into Regiments by the Governor or Commander in Chief, it shall and may be lawful for the Officers so chosen and com∣missioned for the several Companies of each Regiment to meet together, and, by Majority of Votes, in the Way of Ballot, to chuse a Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, and Major, for the Regiment, and present them to the Governor or Commander in Chief, for his Approbation; which Officers so chosen, if approved and commissioned by him, shall be the Colonel, Lieutenant-Colonel, and Major, of the Regiment, according to their Commissions, during the Continuance of this Act.</P>
<P><HI>Provided always,</HI> That if the Governor or Commander in Chief shall not think fit to grant his Commission to any Officer so first chosen and presented, it shall and may be lawful for the Electors of such Officer to chuse Two other Persons in his stead, and present them to the Governor or Commander in Chief; One of whom, at his Pleasure, shall receive his Commission, and be the Officer, as aforesaid.</P>
<P><HI>And be it further Enacted,</HI> by the Authority aforesaid, That, as soon as the said Companies and Regiments are formed, and their Officers commissioned, as afore∣said, it shall and may be lawful to and for the Governor or Commander in Chief, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Colonels, Lieutenant-Colonels, and Majors, of all the Regiments, being for that Purpose by him called and convened, or by and with the Advice and Consent of a Majority of the said Officers that shall be met and present together on such Call, to form, make, and establish, Articles of War, for the better Government of the Forces that shall be under their Command, and for bringing Offenders against the same to Justice; and to erect and constitute Courts-Martial, with Power to hear, try, and determine, any Crimes or Offences by such Articles of War, and inflict Penalties, by Sentence or Judgment of the same, on those who shall be subject thereto, in any Place within this Province: Which Articles of War, when made, as aforesaid, shall be printed and distributed to the Captains of the several Companies, and by them distinctly read to their respective Companies; and all and every Captain, Lieutenant, Ensign, or other Freeman, who shall, after at least Three
<PB N="3" REF="040861_0003_101910F71B628F20"/>Days Consideration of the said Articles, voluntarily sign the same, in Presence of some One Justice of the Peace, acknowleging his having perused, or heard the same di∣stinctly read; and that he has well considered thereof, and is willing to be bound and governed thereby; and promises Obedience thereto, and to his Officers accordingly; shall thenceforth be deemed well and duly bound to the Observance of the said Articles, and to the Duties thereby required, and subject to the Pains, Penalties, Punishments, and Forfeitures, that may therein be appointed for Disobedience, and other Offences.</P>
<P><HI>Provided always,</HI> That the Articles, so to be made and established, shall con∣tain nothing repugnant, but be as near as possible conformable, to the military Laws of <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and to the Articles of War made and established by His Majesty, in pursuance of the last Act of Parliament for punishing Mutiny and Desertion; the different Circumstances of this Province compared with <HI>Great Britain,</HI> and of a vo∣luntary Militia of Freemen compared with mercenary standing Troops, being duly weighed, and maturely considered.</P>
<P><HI>Provided also,</HI> That nothing in this Act shall be understood, or construed, to give any Power or Authority to the Governor or Commander in Chief, and the said Officers, to make any Articles or Rules that shall in the least affect those of the In∣habitants of the Province, who are conscientiously scrupulous of bearing Arms, either in their Liberties, Persons, or Estates; nor any other Persons, of what Persuasion or Denomination soever, who have not first voluntarily and freely signed the said Articles, after due Consideration, as aforesaid.</P>
<P><HI>Provided also,</HI> That no Youth under the Age of Twenty-one Years, nor any bought Servant, or indented Apprentice, shall be admitted to inroll himself, or be capable of being inrolled in the said Companies or Regiments, without the Consent of his or their Parents or Guardians, Masters or Mistresses, in Writing under their Hands, first had and obtained.</P>
<P><HI>Provided also,</HI> That no Inlistment or Inrolment of any Person, in any of the Companies or Regiments to be formed and raised as aforesaid, shall protect such Person in any Suit or civil Action brought against him by his Creditors or others, except during his being in actual Service in Field or Garison; nor from a Prosecution for any Offence committed against the Laws of this Province.</P>
<P><HI>Provided also,</HI> That no Regiment, Company, or Party, of Volunteers shall, by virtue of this Act, be compelled or led more than Three Days March beyond the inhabited Parts of the Province; nor detained longer than Three Weeks in any Ga∣rison, without an express Engagement for that Purpose first voluntarily entered into, and subscribed, by every Man so to march or remain in Garison.</P>
<P>This Act to continue in Force until the Thirtieth Day of <HI>October</HI> next, and no longer.</P>
