<HEAD>To Mr. ISRAEL HOLLY.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOUR piece which was printed last fall, at <HI>New-London,</HI> entitled <Q>The New-Testa∣ment interpretation of the Old, relative to in∣fant baptism,—written letter-wise to Mr. <HI>Isaac Backus,</HI> occasioned by his late answer to Mr. F—'s<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Eheuezer Frothingham, <HI>of</HI> Middletown <HI>in</HI> Connecticut.</NOTE> letter,</Q> has further confirmed me in a sentiment which I adopted many years ago, viz. That a very great part of the controver∣sies, among good men, are caused by their mis∣taking each others ideas. But there are so ma∣ny things in our dark world still to keep them in these mistakes, that nature is ready to say, 'tis in vain to make any further attempts to rectify them. Yet other considerations have induced me to make another short trial, to shew you wherein you have mistaken the scriptures, as well as the ideas of your friend, concerning bap∣tism,</P>
<P>You tell me, that the thing which moved you to write against me, was my holding forth, <Q>That in order to maintain infant baptism, you con∣strue and interpret the New-Testament by the Old, and not the Old by the New,</Q> p. 4. Which you think is contrary to fact with regard to your∣self,
<PB N="4" REF="012317_0003_0F8A206BF199E810"/>and you suppose that if we were willing to receive the New-Testament interpretation of the Old, we also should see warrant for that practice; and you close with giving public notice to me and others, that if we should pretend to answer you and not attend directly to your <HI>ground-work,</HI> you should probably look upon it so impertinent as not to be worthy of a reply, P. 71. I rea∣dily join issue with you here, and desire that all impertinences may be dismissed from this dispute.</P>
<P>Let then the New-Testament interpretation of the Old be the ground-work of all our pro∣ceedings; and how do you take that? Why, in general you say, <Q>There was a spiritual glory then in being, although veiled with a type. there was then the same spiritual good under the type, that there is now without the type. And all who did not stick in the letter, saw that spiritual glory, and embraced that spiritual good,</Q> P. 7, 8. I say the same with all my heart. You observe that the covenant of legal services and ceremonies, considered in themselves, were weak and insufficient to justify and save those who attended them, unless they by faith looked to the end of those things which were to be abolished; and that the carnal Jews, who had no true faith to apprehend Christ in Abraham's Covenant, nor Christ as the substance of those shadows, they terminated in the shadow instead of the substance, to their own destruction, P. 23.
<PB N="5" REF="012317_0004_0F8A206C752FB130"/>And you illustrate the difference between the right use of those things, and the Jews abuse of them, by Paul's familiar <HI>allegory</HI> of the <HI>bond-woman</HI> and the <HI>free,</HI> P. 31,—34, This was the subject of my sermon, which, in its second edition, stands pre∣fixed to what I wrote to Mr. F. and which I ex∣pressly refer to, as what I designed should be part of my answer to him, P. 80. And how came you, Sir, to write above seventy pages in his be∣half, and never take any notice of that sermon, nor let the reader know that I agree with you in all these sentiments? Indeed I am as far as you are from supposing that a man, who writes against another, is obliged to take notice of every thing the other hath said; yet for him to commence a dispute, and then recite a great number of truths, which his opponent holds as much as he does, without letting the reader know but that he de∣nies them all; this you and all men must know is not fair dealing.</P>
<P>And now to come to the point in hand, you observe that in Gen. 17. <Q>Circumcision was insti∣tuted, and directions given for forming Abra∣ham's family into a church-state.—Certain du∣ties and privileges were annexed,—which were thankfully to be acknowleged and punctually complied with, until God should please to add thereto more rites and ceremonies, or take them all away, which were meerly positive, and appoint new ones at his pleasure,</Q> P. 9.10.
<PB N="6" REF="012317_0005_0F8A206CFA4FF698"/>These have long been the sentiments of my heart.</P>
<P>And you allow that if the words in Heb. 8.9. 10. had run in opposition to Abraham's cove∣nant, you would freely give up the point to me, P. 21. Why then do you stand still to dispute? Because you say, <Q>The words of inspiration run quite another way, even to Egypt and Mount Sinai, therefore take notice of them again. I will make a new covenant, <HI>not according to the covenant I made with</HI> their fathers. But when? <HI>In the</HI> DAY <HI>I took them by the band to lead them out of the land of Egypt,</HI></Q> p. 22.</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> I have often taken notice of this, and I desire you to do it once more. That was the DAY in which God added <HI>more</HI> rites and cere∣monies to Abraham's covenant. He instituted the passover, with its various rules, and said <HI>every man servant that is bought for money,</HI> WHEN <HI>thou bast circumcised him,</HI> THEN <HI>shall be cat thereof. All the Congregation of Israel shall keep it.</HI> Also on <HI>that day,</HI> and not till then, he gave orders for bringing <HI>strangers,</HI> and <HI>all their males,</HI> both to circumcision and the passover, <HI>Exod.</HI> xii, 43—48. And when the whole system of ordinances and ceremonies were completed for that church in the wilderness, and the cove∣nant was renewed with the whole nation, (many of whom had not <HI>eyes to see, nor ears to hear</HI>) just before they entered <HI>Canaan,</HI> it was to establish them for a people unto himself, and that he might
<PB N="7" REF="012317_0006_0F8A206DB51FAF88"/>be unto them a God, AS he had sworn unto their <HI>father Abraham,</HI> Deut. xxix, 4—13. So that what was done when they came out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> at <HI>Sinai,</HI> and in the plains of <HI>Moah,</HI> was but the completing of that constitution which first be∣gan in <HI>Gen.</HI> xvii; and a literal fulfilment of that promise to Abraham, <HI>I will be a God to thee, and to thy seed after thee.</HI> And since the Holy Ghost says, the new covenant is <HI>not according</HI> to that covenant made with their fathers, how do you dare to say, <Q>The gentile church is grafted into the <HI>same</HI> covenant—as the Jewish church once stood in!</Q> p. 50.</P>
<P>I am sensible that this is the root of the con∣troversy, and you observe truly, that one blow at the root of a tree of vile fruit, would do as much good as many against the branches, p. 52. But if instead of a vile root you should be found striking against the rock, you will find it much worse than lost labour. You know that infant baptism is not expressed in the Bible, but you suppose that when the head of a family believed, and was baptized, that he afterwards brought his houshold upon his faith, and this is the root your cause stands upon; but the plainest precept for a new professor of religion, to bring his houshold into the church upon his faith, that we have in all the sacred oracles, was given on <HI>the day</HI> that <HI>Israel</HI> came out of <HI>Egypt;</HI> and since the Lord says, his new covenant is <HI>not according</HI> to that
<PB N="8" REF="012317_0007_0F8A206E8E6BA680"/>covenant, and the main point of difference which he describes is, that <HI>all</HI> who are in the new co∣venant shall <HI>know him,</HI> from the <HI>least to the great∣est,</HI> is it not surprising that you stand where you do?</P>
<P>However, since you are so kind as to tell us what you think causes our mistake, I have a no∣tion of making a little attempt to requite my friend in the same way.</P>
<P N="1">1. You suppose that we had taken our prin∣ciples upon <HI>tradition,</HI> and when we came serious∣ly to search the scriptures, we never took the <HI>ideas</HI> belonging to the <HI>words</HI> there used, p. 5. I return the compliment; for, as the <HI>philosophy</HI> and <HI>vain deceit,</HI> after the <HI>traditions of men,</HI> which the Colossians were warned against, were attempts to subject them to <HI>ordinances,</HI> which by those means were drawn from the <HI>handwriting</HI> which Christ had <HI>blotted out,</HI> and <HI>taken out of the way:</HI> Col. 2, 8, 14—22. So I think it is evident that you have not got so clear of those traditions as you imagine you have. My attempt to explain those ambiguous terms, which that deceitful philoso∣phy invented, and which tradition and not scrip∣ture has handed down to us, viz. of Abraham's covenant being the covenant of Grace, and that believers now are in the same covenant, has car∣ried your mind away into such treatment of your brethren, as would shock you in other affairs. Mr. F. had laid those ambiguous terms as the
<PB N="9" REF="012317_0008_0F8A206F3B889DA8"/>foundation of his discourse; and I observed, that in order to settle this matter it was needful to <HI>explain</HI> what we meant by them, and said, <Q>I fully concur with Mr. <HI>F.</HI></Q> that <Q>since <HI>Adam,</HI> our first natural head fell from the covenant which he was placed in, the tenor of which was, <HI>do and live; transgress and die;</HI> the Most High has never come to commune with any of the race of <HI>Adam,</HI> nor to offer good to them, but only in the second head, the Lord Jesus Christ.</Q> <Q>And if by covenant of grace, we mean the glorious plan of salvation, which was laid in the divine mind from eternity, and was discovered at <HI>sundry times,</HI> and in <HI>divers manners</HI> to the <HI>fathers</HI> in the Old-Testament, and is brought in clear light in the New; and that one of those <HI>divers manners</HI> was by <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>'s covenant: In this we have no difference. But if by covenant of grace, he means the <HI>con∣stitution</HI> and limits of the Jewish church, which descended in the line of <HI>natural generation,</HI> tak∣ing in with the parents all their natural off-spring, which is evidently his meaning; in this I cannot concur with him for these reasons.</Q> One of which is, because, <Q>The tenor of <HI>Abra∣ham</HI>'s covenant enjoined conditions, and works to be performed by men; the neglect of which exposed them to be <HI>cut off from their people,</HI> because they had <HI>broken</HI> that <HI>covenant,</HI> Gen. 17.14.</Q> therefore the <HI>letter</HI> of it was, <Q><HI>do
<PB N="10" REF="012317_0009_0F8A207055AD58D0"/>and live;</HI> and the reason here given for setting of it aside is, <HI>because they continued not in it, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.</HI> But the tenor of the new covenant is, <HI>I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people,</HI> Heb. 8.9.10." P. 52—54. of my book these are my words; but you pick out a few of them, without either of these texts of scrip∣ture, and then say; "I don't know what you really think <HI>Abraham</HI>'s covenant was. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> said it was <HI>the covenant of grace,</HI> but you op∣pose him in that, and mean to contradict him,</Q> p. 11. And so because I oppose that's being called <HI>The covenant of Grace,</HI> which per∣sons come into by <HI>natural generation</HI> (for in no other sense did I oppose him) I say, because I oppose that language of tradition, you go on to declare me, and my brethren through me, to be so hetredox as to pretend, <Q>That the <HI>Sinai</HI> dis∣pensation was given of God, as the covenant of works, and that the Jewish church was formed by God upon the covenant of works, and circumcision instituted of God as the seal<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here note that in my 53. page, it was by mistake print∣ed <HI>seal,</HI> where I wrote <HI>seat.</HI></NOTE> of the covenant of works,</Q> P. 35. And you go so far as to say that, <Q>according to the bap∣tists, the true church never had existence un∣til the gospel day,</Q> p. 45. with a great deal
<PB N="11" REF="012317_0010_0F8A207225FC3670"/>more of like nature; which are as real breach∣es of the ninth commandment, as were ever ut∣tered by man; and which appears more surpris∣ing from you, since you own that the apostle, in the Hebrews, <Q>uses the words <HI>covenant</HI> and <HI>tes∣tament,</HI> as terms synonimous; and therefore is not there distinguishing so directly between the covenant of works and the covenant of grace, as he is between the Old and New-Testament dispensations, P. 23.</Q> If so, then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> came you to abuse your brethren as you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> done, only because they oppose the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, that both the Old and New <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are in the <HI>same</HI> covenant! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> my heart, to see you thus <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with tradition, to violate divine rule!</P>
<P N="2">2. You suppose we mistake in not distinguish∣ing between the external administration of the covenant, and its internal efficacy, P. 41. But how do you prove it? You make much of <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.11. but say of us that we <Q>seem to be as much afraid to have this text held up before us, as we would be of a loaded cannon; and say, I never yet was able to obtain a rational an∣swer,</Q> p. 37. To which I shall say, that nei∣ther my courage nor reason have at all fled at the sight of this text, so but that I shall come so near as to take your own dialect, since you can't understand ours. I take it that <HI>Paul</HI> there speaks of the internal efficacy of the covenant on <HI>Abra∣ham's</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="012317_0011_0F8A2072477600F0"/>heart. You agree with me that circum∣cision was a type of Christ's death, and of an inward change, p. 38.39. Well, <HI>Abraham</HI> had experienced the internal efficacy of these things before circumcision was appointed; therefore it was a <HI>seal</HI> to him of <HI>the faith which he bad, yet be∣ing uncircumcised,</HI> that he might be the <HI>father of all them that believe,</HI> whether circumcised or not: From whence the apostle argues against the con∣tinuance of those types, now the antitype is come. But what a poor figure does his argu∣ment make, in the dress men would now put it into? To say, <Q>The covenant of which circum∣cision was a <HI>sign,</HI> is the <HI>same</HI> to all <HI>Abraham</HI>'s <HI>spiritual</HI> seed, as it was to his <HI>natural</HI> posterity:</Q> What argument could be stronger to prove that all his spiritual seed ought to circumcise their children! The very principle which the Apostle was there opposing with all his might!</P>
<P>Circumcision was a <HI>sign</HI> or <HI>token</HI> of the cove∣nant which constituted the Jewish church, and it is never called a <HI>seal</HI> to them in all the bible; but it was a seal to <HI>Abraham</HI> of the faith, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> had in the promise of Christ, and of salvation through him, both to Jews and Gen∣tiles; which promise was given him in <HI>Gen.</HI> 12.3. and 15.5.6. to which places all the apostle's arguments in <HI>Rom.</HI> 4. and <HI>Gal.</HI> 3. expressly re∣fer, and not to <HI>Gen.</HI> 17. as you imagine. And if you search chronology, you will find it general∣ly,
<PB N="13" REF="012317_0012_0F8A207300BB0300"/>if not universally, agreed to by the learned, that the 430 years, which the apostle mentions, is to be reckoned from <HI>Abraham</HI>'s first call out of his own country, when the promise was given him of being <HI>heir of the world,</HI> which promise was not through the law, but through Christ and his righteousness, <HI>Rom.</HI> 4.13. <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.14— 17. Now after his justification by faith in this promise, he went and took the <HI>bond-woman,</HI> and had a son by her, who was 13 years old when circumcision was instituted, and he was the first of <HI>Abraham</HI>'s seed that partook of it, which we have seen was an allegory of the jewish covenant, in distinction from that which the gospel-church is in, <HI>Gal.</HI> 4.24.</P>
<P N="3">3. You say, <Q>The baptists don't distinguish between the true nature, and right improve∣ment of the ceremonial institutions, and how the Jews in general did improve them,</Q> p. 41. But thou that teachest others, teachest thou not thyself? The constitution and ordinances of the Jewish church were shadows of good things to come, and <HI>Abraham</HI>'s first son that was circum∣cised, being born only by ordinary generation, and the other by supernatural power, of parents <HI>as good as dead,</HI> according to <HI>promise,</HI> were types of the difference between the children of his <HI>flesh,</HI> and the <HI>elect;</HI> and it is expressly among the <HI>election of grace</HI> that believing gentiles are <HI>grafted in,</HI> Rom. 9.8. and 11.5.17. and this grafting,
<PB N="14" REF="012317_0013_0F8A2074A5321840"/>if we compare it with <HI>John</HI> 15.1—6. is into Christ by faith, and into his church by a perso∣nal profession of it; for, <HI>with the heart man be∣lieveth unto righteousness, and with the mouth con∣fession is made unto salvation,</HI> Rom. 10.10. But if any who are received into the church prove fruitless, they will be <HI>broken off,</HI> and <HI>taken away,</HI> while living branches are <HI>purged,</HI> that they may bring forth <HI>more fruit.</HI> This appears to be the true nature, and right improvement of the sha∣dow and the substance, and the true distinction between <HI>Jews by nature,</HI> and <HI>sinners of the Gen∣tiles,</HI> and its influence was so pernicious as to carry both <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> away with <HI>dissi∣mulation,</HI> Gal. 2.11—15. which moved <HI>Paul</HI> to withstand them to the face. And he proceeds to shew that all are under the <HI>curse</HI> of the broken law, till they are <HI>redeemed</HI> by Christ, and re∣ceive the <HI>promise of the Spirit through faith,</HI> which are the <HI>blessings of Abraham,</HI> that were to <HI>come on the Gentiles.</HI> And he says, "The scripture hath concluded <HI>all</HI> under sin, that the <HI>promise</HI> by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to <HI>them that believe;</HI> and IF ye be Christ, THEN are ye Abra∣ham's seed, and heirs <HI>according to the promise,</HI> Gal. 3, 10,—14.22.29.</P>
<P>Promise of what? Of <HI>remission of sins,</HI> and the <HI>gist of the Holy Ghost;</HI> and <HI>as many</HI> of the Jews
<PB N="15" REF="012317_0014_0F8A207536EEB2C8"/>and their <HI>children</HI> as were <HI>called,</HI> so as <HI>gladly to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> this <HI>word,</HI> were <HI>baptized</HI> and <HI>added</HI> to the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. 2.38—41. This is the <HI>gospel</HI> which was preached unto Abraham, <HI>before</HI> cir∣cumcision or other rites of the law were institut∣ed; and was now freely preached both to Jews and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> after those rites were abolished; and I find not a word of any of them being bap∣tized, till they prosessed faith in that promise: Yet you must needs go back to the jewish con∣stitution, and from thence frame a plea for bringing your houshold upon your faith. You, Sir, go back to the "federal holiness" of the Old-Testament, to interpret the word <HI>holy</HI> by, in 1 Cor. 7.14, p. 50. Though that Old-Tes∣tament holiness is expressly given as a reason why they should make <HI>no marriages</HI> with other nati∣ons, Deut. 7.3.6. And the same reason is given against eating <HI>unclean meats,</HI> Deut. 14.3—21; neither is there a whit more of consis∣tency or of justice, in going back to that church, for the meaning of the word <HI>holy</HI> in this text, than there is for the meaning of the word <HI>sanctified</HI> in this, and also in 1 Tim. 4.3.—5. which both prove that sort of holiness to be out of date. And by the way, I would not have you forget, that the reason why Abraham's seed might not be circumcised till eight days old, was because their mothers were <HI>unclean</HI> seven days, Levit. 12.2.3. And as all their males were to be circumcised as
<PB N="16" REF="012317_0015_0F8A207B5758BAF8"/>soon as they were clean; so, if any man of them was <HI>clean</HI> and not in a journey at the appointed season of the passover, and <HI>forbore</HI> to keep it, e∣ven the same soul should be cut off from his people, Numb. 9.10.13. So that though natural birth or purchase for money brought per∣sons into that church, yet it is your mistake in supposing they were circumcised only upon a <HI>relative</HI> right, p. 54. Personal qualifications were required for both ordinances; and a ne∣glect of either of them exposed them to be cut off from that church; but to have circumcised a child before he was eight days old would have been a transgression; and so it would to have offered a calf, lamb or kid, before that age, be∣cause God would have no <HI>unclean</HI> thing offered to him, Exod. 22.30. Levit. 22.27. As to the spi∣ritual things which these were types of, in them I suppose we agree: And so we do about the manner of eating the passover; but for you to blend type and antitype together as you do, p. 56. is not just. Neither is it so for you to say, we se∣cretly take it for granted, that it is not a person's sin to remain in unbelief, p. 58. I hold as ful∣ly as you do, that it was a damning sin in every jew, if he did not truly believe in the Messiah to come, who is the substance of those types; and then it must surely be an aggravated sin not to believe in him that is come. But how short-sighted are we! While you attempt to discover
<PB N="17" REF="012317_0016_0F8A207C2B96AD18"/>my secret mistake, you beg the whole question between us. You say, <Q>The baptized child of a true believer is, <HI>by God's appointment</HI> and the parent's act, brought under the bond and seal of the covenant,</Q> p. 61. This is all the ques∣tion between us; only prove that it is <HI>God's ap∣pointment,</HI> and I will give up the dispute in a mi∣nute. Here the point turns.</P>
<P>I fully agree with you, that there is an essential difference between moral duties and positive in∣stitutions. Morality in all ages is in its nature as immutable as the perfections of the deity; but institutions of worship depend intirely upon his sovereign will, and positive appointment; and I like well your description of God's first forming <HI>Abraham</HI>'s family into church-state, with cer∣tain duties and privileges annexed, which were to be thankfully received, and punctually ob∣served, <Q>until God should please to add there∣to more rites and ceremonies, or take them all away,—and appoint new ones at pleasure.</Q> Now the single point between us is, whether he has <HI>taken away</HI> that <HI>covenant</HI> which constituted that church, and appointed a <HI>better covenant, which is established upon better promises;</HI> or whe∣ther the covenant is the <HI>same,</HI> and only changed into different hands, with the appointment of different ordinances. The apostle observes that the <HI>first covenant had ordinances of divine service;</HI> but he does not confound ordinances and cove∣nant
<PB N="18" REF="012317_0017_0F8A207CB62AC688"/>together as you seem to do, p. 23. No, he keeps them distinct; and since he so often dis∣stinguisheth the covenants as well as ordinances, by calling one <HI>Old,</HI> the other <HI>New;</HI> the one <HI>first,</HI> the other <HI>second,</HI> and says Christ <HI>taketh away the first, that he may establish the second,</HI> Heb. 9.1. and 10.9. I should think your evidence was hardly sufficient to prove that a man <Q><HI>boasts</HI> as being by way of <HI>eminence</HI> in the cause of God,</Q> if he did use some "peremptory airs," p. 67. in asserting that, <HI>old</HI> and <HI>new, first</HI> and <HI>second</HI> are not the <HI>same!</HI> Especially when the <HI>first</HI> must be <HI>taken away</HI> in order to <HI>establish the second!</HI></P>
<P>You allow some of the babtists to be <Q>very judicious Christians in other respects, yet think that in this particular (about children's being in covenant) one and all of them may justly be termed near-sighted people,</Q> p. 67. If so, then I am sorry that you happened to be so much troubled with the same calamity, as not to see, that though I supposed the principle of hold∣ing children to be born in the covenant of grace tended to a crying <HI>peace, peace, when there was no peace;</HI> yet that I expressly said in my 66. page, that I was satisfied Mr. <HI>F.</HI> did not commonly teach persons in such a way: Had you but seen that, it might have prevented your complaining of me, as though I charged such language upon <HI>all</HI> parents, who practise infant baptism without <HI>distinction,</HI> p. 64. But it seems a little remark∣able,
<PB N="19" REF="012317_0018_0F8A207DB9E87680"/>that, while you are trying to clear the prin∣ciple of that language, by saying, <Q>When we act up to our principles, we are so far from crying peace, peace, to our baptized children, that we cry, wrath! wrath!—if they go on in sin,</Q> p. 65. Yet you can't get but three pages forward before you call them <Q>the little children of God's <HI>gracious</HI> covenant.</Q> And how near was your sight when you said, <Q>although there is <HI>no mention</HI> made of <HI>infants,</HI> yet housholds include infants, and that is <HI>sufficient</HI> for our purpose?</Q> p. 51. What! did you never see a houshold without an infant in it? If you have, your argument is like that of the minister of <HI>Harwinton,</HI> which you justly observe in your let∣ter to him, p. 23. was no more conclusive, than to argue, that if a man has got <HI>money,</HI> he has cer∣tainly got <HI>gold,</HI> tho' it is well known that the word includes <HI>copper</HI> as really as gold; and you truly tell him that he "was not over-sharp," if he did not see this to be the nature of his argu∣ment.</P>
<P>And, my friend, how sharp was you, to sup∣pose you could read infants in <HI>Lydia</HI>'s house? When by the book she appears to be the head of the family, and there is not the least mention of her over having either husband or child. Again how near was your sight, that you could not see that there is just the fame proof that <HI>all</HI> the gaol∣ers house were taught and believed, as there is
<PB N="20" REF="012317_0019_0F8A207F8C78E2E8"/>that <HI>all</HI> were baptized? <HI>Acts</HI> 16.15.32—34, 40. And how sharp was you at reckoning <HI>figures,</HI> when you concluded that the 8 souls in 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.21. amounted to a proof for a <Q>housholder to <HI>bring</HI> his children to baptismal <HI>sprinkling?</HI></Q> p. 51. as if <HI>Noah</HI> had <HI>brought</HI> his wife, and his sons and their wives, in his <HI>arms</HI> to be sprinkled with rain! Whereas the sacred record informs us, that they all <HI>went into the ark, as God had com∣manded</HI> Noah, <HI>and the Lord shut him in;</HI> where they were <HI>covered</HI> from the rain, and <HI>saved</HI> thro' the <HI>flood,</HI> Gen. 7.7—16.</P>
<P>Once more, how careful was you to see that your words and ideas went together, in your at∣tempt to pull down my pride? As I had wrote three or four times on this controversy without being answered, you represent me as conceiting I <Q>had struck all with such intimidating fear, that there was no one stripling left who dare en∣counter with this great <HI>Goliah,</HI> that has been these several times defying one branch of the army of the living God, viz. the little child∣ren of his gracious covenant,</Q> p. 68. I have been deeply sensible these many years that pride is as bad an enemy as any I have to conflict with and would gladly improve your help as well as others to keep him down; but have I been defy∣ing infants! I had no such thought. The first piece I wrote on this subject was the sermo which you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> now passed over without any
<PB N="21" REF="012317_0020_0F8A207FB5290DF8"/>corrections; and at different times since I have attempted to point out the mistakes of three ministers; and is this defying infants? And as to pride, I can freely leave the impartial public to judge between this supposed <HI>Goliah,</HI> and the <HI>stripling</HI> who has ventured out against him, but has failed so much as to the skill he <HI>conceited</HI> he had, that instead of a real person, all his artillery is discharged at a man of straw of his own making. For I solemnly declare, I know of no man on earth who holds, <Q>That the jewish church was formed by God upon the covenant of works.</Q> Yet your whole book is directed against such an one, which therefore must be only a creature of your own brain.</P>
<P>But, my friend, it is too late in the day to make a jest of these matters. I must come to deal yet more seriously with you. You begin and end your letter, with expressions of respect to me, and tell me, you <Q>trust you say it truly, without nauseous fawning, or criminal flattery;</Q> yet, in the space between, you have covered my sentiments with a false dress, without attending to my explanation of them, and then you have not only compared me to proud <HI>Goliah,</HI> but have also accused me with great ambiguity, which you say to you is very probable I 'use with <HI>design,</HI>' p. 66. If this be not what the scripture calls a <HI>speaking wickedly for God,</HI> I know not what is; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the baptists has been
<PB N="22" REF="012317_0021_0F8A20807A1C6760"/>handed down by tradition ever since <HI>Luther</HI>'s day. Tho' while I deal thus plainly with you for your faults, I would by no means forget to give you credit, for your guarding against an∣other branch of <HI>deceitful</HI> philosophy, that has been practised as long as the other: Which is the bringing up the characters of men, as a test to decide what is the truth of God. This has moved many to violate the rule of truth and equity, in order to keep up a bad character of the baptists, and a good one of their opponents, and many of our baptists fathers in this land, have neglected to do justice to themselves, and to posterity, by detecting those evils; and the sore trials and <HI>siftings</HI> that I endured by such means, with the authority of that command, <HI>When thou art converted strengthen thy brethren,</HI> have, if I know my heart, been the chief mo∣tives to all I have written on this subject. I say, I would not forget this cautiousness that you have shewn, p. 64. which your friend <HI>F.</HI> did not.</P>
<P>And tho' you suppose my mind is <Q>narrow∣ed up with rigid superstition,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Superstition is the having our <HI>fear</HI> toward God influ∣enced by the <HI>precepts of men,</HI> instead of his commands; and as baptism is the duty of every believer, have you not re∣flected upon him in saying, <Q>His word has revealed this point more <HI>darkly</HI> than some others?</Q> p. 7. When in reality the scriptures are so light, that all the power of su∣perstitution has never been able to <HI>darken</HI> them, so but that you and all are forced to allow, that <HI>dipping</HI> is <HI>baptism;</HI> yet now you call me rigid and superstitious, only because I cannot allow <HI>sprinkling</HI> to be baptism, when I cannot find one text in the bible to support such a meaning of the word. And as to the danger of injuring our health, which some plead; a noted physician in our nation, speaking of <HI>cold-bathing,</HI> says, <Q>I cannot sufficiently admire, how it should ever have come into such disufe, especially among <HI>chris∣tians,</HI> when commanded by the greatest Law-giver that ever was, under the direction of God's holy spirit, to his chosen people, and perpetuated to us, in the <HI>immersion</HI> at <HI>baptism,</HI> by the same spirit, who, with infinite wisdom in this, as in every thing else that regards the <HI>temporal</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> felicity of his creatures, combined their <HI>duty</HI> with their eternal <HI>happiness.</HI></Q> Dr. Cheyne's essay of <HI>health</HI> and <HI>long life,</HI> p. 100.101.</NOTE></Q> because I hold that Christ has not only appointed the ordinance of baptism; but also the <HI>manner</HI> of its admini∣stration,
<PB N="23" REF="012317_0022_0F8A2081335A02E8"/>so that when men have done something else under that name, it is not the thing which he commanded; yet I am fully sensible that I never enjoyed so much freedom from a narrow rigid temper, as I have since my present estab∣lishment; and never was more fully persuaded than I am now, of the real piety and eminent usefulness of many pedobaptists, both in former and latter times; whom therefore I would ever respect and honor; but I hope never to give up the truth for any man.</P>
<P>One thing more I must beg your attention to, and I shall conclude, which is this; we are none of us willing to be thought fond of controversy;
<PB N="24" REF="012317_0023_0F8A2081F1FEE3A0"/>you say, 'I am far from desiring to continue it? But how shall we prevent its continuance? You own you have not <Q>attended directly to my plan, and the ground-work thereof,</Q> yet tell me that if I don't <HI>attend directly</HI> to yours, you shall look upon it impertinent, p. 71. and who discovers most pride here? The want of attending to my plan has caused you to abuse your brethren as you have done; and if I write again, I shall, accord∣ing to your notion, give another proof of being a proud, contentious person; yet if I do not, even honest people, who have no better means of information than your writings, will be apt to think the people called baptists are such absurd creatures as to hold, that there was only the sha∣dow of a church in the Old-Testament, and that 'the true church never had existence till the gospel day.' I say, they will be apt to think so of the whole denomination; for your reproach, as <HI>Esther</HI> said of <HI>Haman</HI>'s decree, is laid against <HI>all my people;</HI> to which you add an insinuation of 'designed ambiguity,' in my defence of this cause: Than which, what could you have said worse of an honest man? And which a due <HI>at∣tention</HI> to what I have wrote would doubtless have prevented. And must this sword devour for∣ever? It will surely be bitterness in the latter end.</P>
<P>One method however occurs to my mind, which I think to take, to try to draw you out of your entrenchment under the language of tradition,
<PB N="25" REF="012317_0024_0F8A2082B4B32660"/>and to prevent any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> was born <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and that the <HI>gospel</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>which is Christ,</HI> was <HI>preached</HI> to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>believed</HI> therein to his justification <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which was the <HI>covenant confirmed of God <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> that the <HI>law could not disannul,</HI> Gal. 3.8.16.17. But I declare boldly, that neither his first nor his second birth gave him any right to circumcise either himself or his seed. All the right he had to do that, was by a positive institution many years after, by a covenant which formed his <HI>houshold</HI> in∣to a church, with circumcision for the token of their membership, from whence the Holy Ghost calls it <HI>The Covenant of Circumcision,</HI> Act. 7.8. but never the covenant of grace. I believe that the choice of that nation, for God's only visible church in the world, was a type of the <HI>holy na∣tion,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pet. 2.9.</NOTE> of his elect among all who were, either by birth or purchase, incorporated into that church, was a type of Christ's shedding his blood to purchase his chosen, and of their regeneration, by his grace.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Rom. 2.29. Phil. 3.3. Col. 2.11.</NOTE> And when Christ by his death abolished circumcision, he also <HI>took away</HI> the <HI>co∣venant</HI> which it was a token of, and made a <HI>new covenant</HI> with Abraham's believing children, <HI>not according to the covenant</HI> he made with their <HI>father.</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="012317_0025_0F8A208491218F20"/>He did not <HI>cast away his people which he foreknew;</HI> no, they were before in his covenant, but now he made a <HI>new covenant</HI> with them, which <HI>broke off</HI> all Abraham's unbelieving poste∣rity, and <HI>grafted</HI> in the believing gentiles among the elect Jews.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rom. 11.2.5.17.</NOTE> Thus he instituted a new church-state of the <HI>houshold of God,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. 2.19—22.</NOTE> and ap∣pointed the ordinance of baptism as a token of membership therein, and ordered his ministers to administer the same to such, and only such, as made a credible profession of the new-birth, and of saving faith in Jesus Christ.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mat. 28.19.20. Mar. 16.15.16. Acts 8.37. Rom. 10.10.</NOTE> And as natural generation brought persons into Abra∣ham's covenant, which is called <HI>everlasting,</HI> so the natural posterity of Aaron, and none but they, were appointed by a like <HI>everlasting covenant</HI> to minister at God's altar in that church,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Numb. 25.13.</NOTE> both of which were types of the <HI>lively stones,</HI> the <HI>holy priesthood,</HI> of which Christ's <HI>spiritual house</HI> is built. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.5. Therefore I challenge you and all men upon earth, to shew, if you can, any evidence from the divine oracles, to entitle the natural offspring of believers to baptism, before they personally profess faith in Chirst, any more than
<PB N="27" REF="012317_0026_0F8A20851E8C1568"/>there is to confine the gospel ministry to the chil∣dren of ministers.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">I find the apostle makes use of this very argument, to prove to the Hebrews, that Jesus has <HI>disannulled</HI> the cere∣monial law, of which circumcision was a part, and has in∣troduced a <HI>better testament, a better covenant</HI> than that which the Jewish church stood in, Heb. 7.18.22. and 8.6.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>This is the plan I am upon, and this is my testimony, and if you or any other can shew any part of it to be contrary to truth, do it by all means; but if any accuse me of knowingly hold∣ing any thing contrary hereto, they in that respect join with the old accuser of the brethren, let them otherwise be ever so pious: And (though most unworthily) I hope to overcome them by the blood of the lamb, and by a close adhe∣rence to the testimony of truth, even unto the death. If you call this boasting, you have com∣pelled me; and it is only a hope of putting some stop to the fire of contention, which abounds more in your part of the country than ours, con∣cerning the covenant and a right to ordinances; or at least a stop to my concern therein, that has brought me to this length.</P>
<P>Some would lay the blame of these contentions to those called new-lights, some to the separates, and others to baptists; but my opinion is, that the power of the gospel was the first means of breaking up the carnal peace which our land was settled into, by which great members were
<PB N="28" REF="012317_0027_0F8A2085C39F6228"/>cut off from nature's stock, and grafted into Christ. Yet many of them flocked into church∣es which were very much blenced with the world. And those who knew what they were doing in the separation, came out to have the church a distinct body from the world, and I sup∣pose they all, to a man, testified against what is called the half way covenant; though most of them did not see that they only struck at the branches, and not at the root of that evil, while they still applied the token of the gospel cove∣nant to intants, which had no other birth than that which brings us all into this world. And when some of us were convinced of this, and act∣ed accordingly, Mr. F's letter, and yours, will shew how we have been treated by our brethren: And lately this controverly has appeared, and is carried to a great height, among those called standing ministers.</P>
<P>Dr. Bellamy has written a number of times against the half-way covenant, and has taken much pains to shew that the covenant which is publicly owned, implies a profession of saving grace; and therefore, that if the person who makes the profession has no grace, his profession is a lie. But many have tried to avoid this con∣sequence. At length Mr. Moses Mather pub∣lished a pamphlet, to prove that the visible church is in covenant with God, according to Abraham's convenant, and consequently that all
<PB N="29" REF="012317_0028_0F8A2086756D0080"/>who are in covenant ought to be in the use of all the means and ordinances of it, in order to obtain grace and salvation. Against this the Dr. wrote 80 pages, and because Mr. M. left the word <HI>grace</HI> out of his description of the external co∣venant, he charges him with <Q>giving up the grounds,</Q> on which Messieurs <HI>Dickinson, Clark</HI> and <HI>Bostwick,</HI> vindicated infant baptism.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Dr. Bellamy's first piece against Mr. Mather, page. 9.</NOTE> And the Dr. represents Mr. M's covenant to be so void of any privilege that he says,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Page 75.</NOTE> <Q>He has no right, upon his scheme, to the apostles answer in Rom. 3.1.2. For, as to <HI>the oracles of God,</HI> which he claims for one of the chief privileges of his external covenant, he will grant, that they are common to the unbap∣tized, i. e. the unbaptized have as good a right to read and hear the word of God, as the baptized have; and as good a right to believe and embrace the gospel. For, by Christ's last commission, <HI>the gospel is to be preached to all nations;</HI> yea, to <HI>every creature:</HI> And that, previous to, and in order to prepare men for baptism, Mar. 16.15.16. So that, there is not the least need of being in his external co∣venant, in order to have as good a right to hear and believe, and be justified by the gospel, as any man on earth has: <HI>For there is no dif∣ference,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="012317_0029_0F8A20876DFDF0E8"/>Rom. 3.22. compare Mat. 10.5, 6. and 28.19.</Q></P>
<P>Well done doctor! here you talk reason and scripture too. But if a stranger might be so bold as to ask, whether natural generation conveys grace to your child or not? 'Tis likely the answer would be, no, by no means: And if it might be farther asked, whether you hold to the popish doctrine, of the sacraments, conferring grace by the <HI>operation of work done?</HI> Would you not resent the suggestion with abhorrence?— If neither natural generation, nor what parents and ministers have <HI>done,</HI> in baptizing children, confer grace upon them, where are they before God gives it to them but in Mr. Mather's <HI>external</HI> covenant? And to imagine that they have a better claim to the spirit's influence to make the means of grace effectual, than other sinners; this the Dr. truly observes is inconsistent with God's <HI>having mercy on whom he will have mercy.</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 76. As to your saying, <Q>The question is not whether baptism secures the salvation of the child of a believer, nor whether it enables the child to believe; but whether the child is not hereby brought under an additional obligation to believe and repent?</Q> Which you assert he is, p. 61. I answer, that all God's appointments add to our obligation; but the question between us is, whether infant baptism be his appointment or not? And to beg the question and then argue from it is poor business. As to God's precious promises to his saints, of the out-pouring of his spirit on their children, I trust I prize them as much as you do: But observe their order, particularly that you mention, p. 26. First the spirit is poured on their offspring, which gives life and causes them to <HI>spring up,</HI> and then they profess his name, and <HI>subscribe with their hand unto the Lord,</HI> Isa. 44.3—5. The Dr. knows, by the two last texts he quotes, that the apostles were limited in their first commission, to preach to none but such as were in Abraham's covenant; but by their last, they were commanded to teach all nations; and how great a difference between the covenants does this discover!</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="012317_0030_0F8A2087F792CA98"/>
Mr. M. has published a reply, in which he says, <Q>It is evident, that it is not from the covenant of grace, strictly taken, but from a <HI>particular positive institution,</HI> that the visible churh derives its being. It is the covenant of grace that composeth, and unites the several members of Christ's spiritual body, but the vi∣sibe body of Christ is composed, and united by a particular institution.</Q> And he charges the doctor with "using the argument of the <HI>Anabaptists,</HI>" because he does not regard this distinction.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Mr. Mather's second piece on the covenant, printed at New-Haven, 1770, p. 77. 78.</NOTE> Thus a frightful name that super∣stition has imposed upon us, serves each party in their turn, in the room of argument, though of∣ten to the injury of truth: For it is not truth to say, we do not observe this distinction. And while they both try to support their sentiments by Abraham's covenant, yet neither of them dare act up to it. For Mr. M. who goes the far∣thest,
<PB N="32" REF="012317_0031_0F8A2089C6ED6448"/>observes, that Abraham's covenant, as it was renewed in Deut. 29. took in all that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> whether <HI>present</HI> or <HI>absent,</HI> and was extended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <Q>even to such whose <HI>consent</HI> to it was not to as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Page 72.</NOTE></Q> Yet as to our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> says, <Q>It is allowed on all hands, that it is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> outward profession, confirmed with the ap∣pointed seal by which a man <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> a mem∣ber of the visible church.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Page 77. What this profession is, he leaves in the dark, and dwells chiefly on the negative, that it cannot be a profession of saving grace; and asserts that the <HI>only possible method</HI> of erecting a visible church in that way, must be by covenanting upon an <HI>absolute certainty,</HI> p. 82. This is a plea they dwell much upon; though you truly observe to the minister of Harwinton, that 'tis full as much against them as us; for 'tis as much the divine preroga∣tive to know certainly that a man has moral sincerity, and speculative faith, when he professes it, as it is to know one has gracious sincerity, and saving faith when he professes that. And as to a certainty of our own state, Mr. Edwards against Mr. Williams, goes much further; for he proves it to be a maxim with Mr. Stoddard, and with protestants in general, that <HI>absolute certainty</HI> of the scriptures being true, is attained only by their saving power on our hearts. And if so, then 'tis self-evident that <HI>absolute certainty</HI> of our hav∣ing a right to a scripture-ordinance, cannot be had, with∣out saving faith. So that this argument from certainty, would only exclude the doubting Christian, till he attained assurance; while it lays a <HI>certain</HI> bar against every unrege∣nerate person under heaven, till he is savingly enlightned.</NOTE></Q> Thus he appears to know, that the covenant now is not the same that the Jewish church stood in, and yet you all will plead that 'tis the same. We know as well as that gentleman, that the
<PB N="33" REF="012317_0032_0F8A208A318AC510" MS="y"/>were added in being under the former dispensa∣tion; yet for him to say as he does, that <Q>There is not the least hint in all the apostles writings, that it was a <HI>new church,</HI></Q> is directly against the other text that he brings, which says, Christ has <HI>abolished</HI> those Jewish laws and ordinances, for to make <HI>in himself</HI> of twain one <HI>new man.</HI> Eph. 2.13—15. and 3.6. The body is the same that existed under the types; but a <HI>new covenant,</HI> a new positive institution of a church-state, is made with them <HI>not according</HI> to that made with their fathers. And I have no hope of their ever bringing this controversy to an end, till they will come to allow, that the apostles knew as well how to express their own meaning, as any now do how to express it for them.</P>
<P>And as I have already proved, that both the house of Abraham, and of Aaron, were types of the <HI>houshold of God,</HI> whereof the gospel-church is constituted; and as none might minister at, or partake with the altar, but Aaron's posterity, and the apostle says of gospel-believers, we have an altar whereof they have <HI>no right to eat,</HI> who serve the tabernacle, Heb. 13.10. I leave you to consider what you are doing, while you claim a <HI>right</HI> to bring your children to a gospel-ordinance upon Abraham's covenant, and yet pay no re∣gard
<PB N="34" REF="012317_0033_0F8A208D25BA4788"/>to Aaron's covenant, which was equally <HI>everlasting,</HI> and much more strict; for one ad∣mitted of proselytes, while the other did not. And if those who served the tabernacle, and kept to the type, when the antitype was come, had <HI>no right</HI> to gospel privileges, what are those do∣ing who will blend type and antitype together, even to this day? I never yet could obtain a direct answer to this question, either from learn∣ed or unlearned, and if you, sir, can give a satisfy∣ing one, you will much oblige your hearty friend.</P>
