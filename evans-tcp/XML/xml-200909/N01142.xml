<HEAD>An Historical Introduction.</HEAD>
<P>DUTY to the Merit and Memory of my De∣parted MASTER, is now in its Operation. The <HI>Fifth Commandment</HI> well considered will demand such a Duty. When <HI>Quirin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> made a Marble Monument for his <HI>Master,</HI> there was this Effect of it, <HI>Invisunt Locum Studiosi Juve∣nes frequenter, ut hoc Exemplo Edoc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i, quantum Discipu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> praeceptoribus suis debeant, perpetuo meminisse velint. Scholars</HI> that saw it, Learnt from the Sight what Ac∣knowledgments were due from <HI>Scholars</HI> to their <HI>Masters.</HI> I wish my little feeble <HI>Essay</HI> for <HI>Mine,</HI> may in any mea∣sure animate the Gratitude of any <HI>Scholars</HI> to their Well-deserving <HI>Tutors.</HI></P>
<P>A due Care about a <HI>Funeral</HI> for the Dead, among the <HI>Jews</HI> had that Phrase for it: <HI>A Bestowing of Mercy.</HI> But the <HI>Sermon</HI> which I have Employ'd on the <HI>Funeral</HI> of my <HI>Master,</HI> must be called; <HI>A Doing of Justice.</HI> And I am very much misinformed, if this were not the <HI>Gene∣ral Voice</HI> of all the Auditory.</P>
<P><HI>Perfection</HI> in this Life, is to be <HI>Despaired</HI> of, must not be <HI>pretended</HI> to.</P>
<P>I am not insensible, that the Criticks find <HI>Gross Faults</HI> even in those <HI>Classick Authors,</HI> to whom, if our Exercises be not conformed, our <HI>Masters</HI> will <HI>mark</HI> what we do. <HI>Tully</HI> himself himself will be hardly allow'd by <HI>Va<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>la</HI> and <HI>Erasmus,</HI> to have written <HI>True Latin,</HI> in his; <HI>Diuti∣us Commora<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Athenis erat Animus ad te Scribere:</HI> And, <HI>Quum in animo haber<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m navigandi.</HI> Yea, in his own Time, his Friend <HI>Attieus</HI> charged him with <HI>False Latin,</HI> and he was put upon pleading the Authority of <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ren<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> in his own Defence. <HI>Linacer,</HI> one of our Greatest Cri∣ticks

for the Latin Tongue, never could endure the <HI>Cice∣ronian</HI> Style; <HI>Ciceronis dictionem, nunquam probare potuit, nec si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Fastidi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> audire.</HI> These Critical Folks, Employ their <HI>Satyrs,</HI> [And, by the way, this very word may be also criticised upon; for it should be writ, <HI>Saetir,</HI> or, <HI>Satur,</HI> and originally signified nothing but, <HI>A well-fil'd Writing:</HI>] upon <HI>Ovid.</HI> They say they find him for e∣ver stumbling at the Threshold, and blundring in his first Verse. To mention only our <HI>Two</HI> School-books. The one begins, <HI>Parve, nec invideo;</HI> Which they say is not Good Sense; for it should have been, <HI>Parve sed in∣video.</HI> The other begins, <HI>In Nova <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ert animus mutatas dicere forma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Corpora,</HI> which, except you'l help it off, with calling it a Figure, they say is very Nonsense. I am sensible that Ingenious Men do take his part, a∣gainst these <HI>Hypercritical</HI> Objectors. Nor would I make my self a Party to Objections that seem to have no better Foundations. I only show how ready some Folks are at Fishing for Carps. And indeed, Though his <HI>Metamorphosis</HI> has fewer Faults, than the rest of his Works, yet it is not without them; Among which, I must my self confess, his confounding the <HI>Suns</HI> Diur∣nal and Annual Motion, in <HI>Phaetons</HI> business, is hardly Excusable. Nor can <HI>Virgil</HI> himself altogether escape the Lash; even <HI>Virgil,</HI> of whom 'tis mentioned by <HI>Macro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> as his Praerogative, <HI>ut nullus Laudibus crescat, nullius vituneratione minuatur.</HI> The Learned not only tax the Modesty, of his Hero, who when he comes to Speech-ma∣king, begins with <HI>S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pius Aeneas,</HI> but find many odd mistakes in him: and now and then such For∣getfulness; as, <HI>Al terram Hesperiam venies,</HI> and anon, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>certi quo <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erunt.</HI> But if the <HI>Aen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>domasti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of the Envious <HI>Carbilius,</HI> or <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnius</HI>'s Collections of the Faults in <HI>Virgil,</HI> were in our hands, we should say, Who can <HI>stand before Envy?</HI> In our Age, none was re∣puted a more Excellent Latinist than <HI>Milton:</HI> and yet there are those who find passages in him, which are so

far from <HI>Elegant,</HI> that they are not <HI>Proper Latin;</HI> they offend against the <HI>Rules of Grammar.</HI> There was not a more Elegant Writer of the <HI>Latin Tongue</HI> in these Later Ages than <HI>Strada;</HI> and yet how severely exposed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a famous, but waspish Grammarian, in a Book Entitled, <HI>Infamia Famiani Stradae?</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Grammarians</HI> have Escaped as little as their Authors. <HI>Futschius</HI> who publishes them, yet is forced sometimes to Disparage them. And <HI>Priscian</HI> himself, of whose <HI>Head</HI> we are so tender, yet in his very first Lines, hardly keeps out of <HI>Barbarisms.</HI> When <HI>Valla</HI> and <HI>Erasmus,</HI> and <HI>Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er</HI> have done their best, <HI>Sanctius</HI> comes, and then <HI>Schioppius,</HI> and will have us know, they have scarce done any thing at all.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grammar</HI> now taught in our Schools goes under the Name of <HI>Lillies;</HI> tho' in his own time, he modestly decli∣ned the honour of it; and it is well known, that the <HI>Eng∣lish Rudiments</HI> were done by <HI>Colet,</HI> the <HI>Syntaxis</HI> was done by <HI>Erasmus,</HI> and other parts by other hands. Even this <HI>Gram∣mar</HI> is not without its <HI>Faults;</HI> and besides other <HI>just Excep∣tions</HI> against persisting in the use of it, and thereby prolong∣ing the Reign of the <HI>Ferula,</HI> which <HI>cannot be heard;</HI> (<HI>Inex∣orable Custome</HI> will not hear them!) there are those who find it not free from <HI>Solaecisms.</HI></P>
<P>We must not wonder at it then, if the <HI>Best</HI> of our <HI>Masters,</HI> be thought attended with their <HI>Imperfections.</HI> Whatever mine might have, they are <HI>buried.</HI> And we generally con∣cur in acknowledging, <HI>That</HI> New-England <HI>has never known a better.</HI> I am sure, I have as much Reason to appear for him, as ever <HI>Crito</HI> for his Master <HI>Socrates,</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Short History</HI> of his <HI>Long Usefulness,</HI> is to be com∣prized in the Ensuing Articles.</P>
<P>He was Born in <HI>London,</HI> many years before the Birth of <HI>New-England.</HI> It was <HI>Jan.</HI> 25. 1614.</P>
<P>He arrived into this Country, in <HI>June</HI> 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7. with the rest of those Good men, who sought a peaceable Secession in an <HI>American</HI> Wilderness, for the pure Evangelical, and In∣stituted Worship of our Great Redeemer; to which he kept a strict Adherence all his Days. He then Sojourned first a little while, part of a Year, at <HI>Boston;</HI> so that at <HI>Boston,</HI> he
<PB REF="001361_0005_0FB292341C176030"/>
both Commenced and Concluded his <HI>American</HI> Race. His <HI>Holy</HI> Life, was a <HI>Married</HI> Life.</P>
<P>He began the Laborious Work of a <HI>School-master,</HI> at <HI>New-haven;</HI> where he continued for <HI>Twelve</HI> Years.</P>
<P>From <HI>New-haven,</HI> he removed unto <HI>Ipswich,</HI> in <HI>December,</HI> 1650. where he Laboured Eleven Years.</P>
<P>From <HI>Ipswich,</HI> he removed unto <HI>Charlstown,</HI> in <HI>November,</HI> 1661. where he Laboured Nine Years.</P>
<P>From <HI>Charlstown,</HI> he came over to <HI>Boston, Jan.</HI> 6. 1670. where his Labours were continued for Eight &amp; Thirty Years.</P>
<P>He Died, on Saturday morning, <HI>Aug.</HI> 21. 1798. In the Ninety Fourth Year of his Age▪ After he had been a Skil∣ful, Painful, Faithful <HI>School-master,</HI> for <HI>Seventy</HI> Years; And had the Singular Favour of Heaven, that tho' he had Use∣fully spent his Life among <HI>Children,</HI> yet he was not become <HI>Twice a Child;</HI> but held his Abilities, with his Usefulness, in an unusual Degree, to the very last.</P>
<P>It is a Common Adage in the <HI>Schools</HI> of the <HI>Jewes; A Just man never dies, till there be born in his room, one that is like him.</HI> So Crown a Town as <HI>Boston,</HI> is capa∣ble of honourably Supporting more than one <HI>Grammar-School.</HI> And it were to be wished, That several as Able as our <HI>CHEEVER,</HI> might arise in his room, to carry on an Excellent Education in them. Our Glorious LORD can <HI>make</HI> such <HI>men.</HI></P>
<P>But, Oh! That SCHOOLS were more Encouraged, throughout the Country!</P>
<P>I remember, the Jewish Masters have a Dispute about the Reasons of the Destruction of <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> And among the rest the Judgment of R. <HI>Menona,</HI> was; <HI>It had not been de∣stroy'd, but for their not minding to bring up their Chil∣dren in the School.</HI> Verily, There cannot be a more Threatning Symptom of <HI>Destruction</HI> upon us, than there would be in this thing; If we should fall into the Folly of, <HI>Not minding to bring up our Children in the School.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Pastors</HI> of the Churches must more bestir themselves. O Men of God, Awake; And let the Cares of our ELIOT for his <HI>Roxbury,</HI> be a Pattern for you▪</P>

<HEAD>An ESSAY upon Well-Taught <HI>Children;</HI> And upon an Able and Faithful TEACHER of Them.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>2 Tim. III. 15.</HI></BIBL>
<P>From a CHILD, thou hast known the HOLY SCRIP∣TURES, which are able to make thee WISE UNTO SALVATION.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT was a Great CASE, which the Parents to a Son of Great Hope, once put unto a Messenger of Heaven; Judg. 13.12. <HI>How shall we order the Child, and what shall we do unto him?</HI> The <HI>Education of our Chil∣dren</HI> is a point of inexpressible Consequence; of un∣parallelled Importance. Unworthy to be <HI>Parents,</HI> most worthy to be Esteemed rather <HI>Monsters</HI> than <HI>Parents,</HI> are they, who are not sollicitous to give their <HI>Children</HI> an <HI>Agreeable Education.</HI> There is no Serious <HI>Religion</HI> in those <HI>Parents,</HI> who are not sollicitous, that their <HI>Children</HI> should have a <HI>Religious Education.</HI> Our <HI>Children</HI> are so Numerous; The <HI>Temptations</HI> which Endanger the Ruine of our Children are so Innumerable; that we ought frequently, and earnestly to insist on this point, <HI>Their Agreeable and Religious Educa∣tion.</HI> We will now therefore Enquire; <HI>How shall we order the Children; and that shall we do unto them?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="001361_0007_0FB29238F487F7B0"/>I will answer in one word; Let the <HI>Children</HI> have such an <HI>Education</HI> as <HI>Timothy</HI> had. We have before us a Descrip∣tion of that <HI>Education;</HI> and a Direction to give you this.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE.</HI> That Saving Wisdom is to be fetch'd from the Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures; and the Early Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures, is the way to be Betimes made Wise unto Salva∣tion.</HEAD>
<P>That we may more intelligibly prosecute this <HI>Doctrine,</HI> we will first a little Entertain our selves with the History of, <HI>A Child made Wise unto Salvation, by the Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.</HI> A TIMOTHY, and the <HI>Education</HI> of a Lovely <HI>Timothy,</HI> shall be first a little set before us.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Timothy</HI> is now Address'd by the Aged Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> at this time a Prisoner at <HI>Rome;</HI> with an Epistle written by him, a little before his Martyrdom: An Epistle, which <HI>Chrysostom</HI> ingeniously calls, <HI>Our Apostles Last Will and Testa∣ment.</HI> In this Epistle, Our Apostle Exhorts his Excellent and Beloved <HI>Son Timothy;</HI> [a <HI>Son,</HI> he might well call him, having so many ways both <HI>Adopted</HI> him, and Instructed him:] He Exhorts him to Stedfastness in the Faith and Work of His Glorious LORD. One Argument, with which he inculcates this Exhortation, is his <HI>Education.</HI> For one Educated in the <HI>Way of Truth,</HI> and in the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures,</HI> to forsake the <HI>Way of God,</HI> is worse than for another to do so. From such as are <HI>Well</HI> Educated, there are <HI>Better Things</HI> expected than from others. Consider this, O Apostates from a <HI>New-English</HI> Education; <HI>Consider</HI> it, you that <HI>Forget</HI> how you have been <HI>Educated,</HI> lest the <HI>Wrath</HI> of Heaven <HI>tear you to pieces, and there who none to deliver you.</HI> When the Son and Grandson perhaps, of those that have been Faithful Servants of God shall first Go off to an Ob∣servable Degree of Bigotry, for the <HI>Superstition,</HI> against which his Progenitors had born glorious <HI>Testimonies;</HI> and then go on to a <HI>Malignity</HI> against the People of God among which, he has had his <HI>Education;</HI> and publish his <HI>Malignity</HI> with abhorred strains of <HI>Profaness,</HI> and <HI>Atheism:</HI> 'Tis not enough
<PB N="3" REF="001361_0008_0FB2923A7B0AB730"/>
to call upon such an one, with the old Jewish Rebuke, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Thou Vinegar, the Son of Good Wine!</HI> It must be said, he is a <HI>dreadful Spectacle.</HI> He has made himself so; And one may tremble to think, What the Holy God will e'er long make of him. <HI>Friend,</HI> When the <HI>Goodness</HI> of a Young man, like the <HI>Morning Cloud,</HI> and the <HI>Early Dew,</HI> soon <HI>passes away,</HI> the Justice of God is not long upon the Deliberation, <HI>What shall I do unto thee! What shall I do unto thee!</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Timothy</HI> was very happy in his <HI>Education.</HI> It may be Edifying for us, a little to Reflect on the <HI>Occasion</HI> of this Education, and the <HI>Influence</HI> of it.</P>
<P>Our <HI>Timothy</HI> had a Godly <HI>Mother,</HI> and a Godly <HI>Grandmo∣ther.</HI> He might suck in Knowledge and Goodness <HI>with his Mothers Milk.</HI> He might be Taught the Right Wayes of the Lord, while his Grandmother had him by his Leading-st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ings. Both of them were <HI>Jews;</HI> And probably they were Early Converts to <HI>Christianity.</HI> His Father was a <HI>Gentile!</HI> Whether a <HI>Proselyte</HI> or no, we are not informed. But he al∣so was Converted unto <HI>Christianity</HI> at the same time with his desirable Consort. They had before this, betimes begun to give their little Son, the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.</HI> An Early Tincture of <HI>Scriptural Piety</HI> thus took the Mind of the <HI>Child.</HI> But when the Parents were brought home to the Blessed JESUS, they wholly committed, as it seems, their Little <HI>Son,</HI> unto the Care of that Venerable Minister, who had been their <HI>Spiritual Father.</HI> Having themselves got good by a Minister of God, they must have their Child, in the way of getting the same Good. They begg'd <HI>Paul,</HI> to take the Tuition of him; Oh! happy Child, in the Hands of such a Tutor!</P>
<P>Well; And what was the <HI>Effect</HI> of this <HI>Education?</HI> Our <HI>Timothy</HI> did himself prove a Christian of the <HI>First Race;</HI> yea, and an admirable <HI>Minister,</HI> His Labours in the <HI>Harvest</HI> of the Lord, were Extraordinary; Every one wondred, how any one man, could ever <HI>Labour so abundantly.</HI> He was of a <HI>Feeble</HI> Constitution; and of such an Abstemious <HI>Tempe∣rance,</HI> that he was even blamed for it; but one of an <HI>Active Soul,</HI> One of a <HI>Flaming Zeal.</HI> The Great <HI>Paul</HI> could give this Testimony of him, That he did not know another man in the world, who so <HI>Naturally</HI> took to the doing of Good;
<PB N="4" REF="001361_0009_0FB2923C48CA7530"/>
Who so Readily and Chearfully Laid Hold on all Opportu∣nities to be <HI>Serviceable</HI> An <HI>Angelical</HI> sort of a man; One highly Esteemed by <HI>John,</HI> as well as by <HI>Paul;</HI> Those <HI>Angels in Flesh</HI> Loved him dearly. He was an <HI>Angel</HI> in the Church of <HI>Ephesus;</HI> The Ancients agree to call him. <HI>An Admirable Young man.</HI> At last, he became an <HI>Old man.</HI> And then, One Day the Votaries of <HI>Diana</HI> carrying their Images about the Town, and with <HI>Masks</HI> and <HI>Clubs,</HI> and <HI>Dances,</HI> commit∣ting a thousand Insolencies, this brave man Step'd out into the Street, and would have perswaded them, to leave off their <HI>Idolatries</HI> and <HI>Impieties:</HI> Whereat the Enraged <HI>Mob,</HI> fell upon him, and Murdered him. He had the <HI>Crown</HI> of <HI>Martyrdom.</HI> He obtained a claim to a part in that <HI>Resurrec∣tion,</HI> which his Tutor once declared himself sollicitous, <HI>By any means,</HI> to <HI>attain</HI> unto. What? And will the <HI>Early Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> make such a man?</P>
<P>I now with some Enforcement, can tell my Hearers over again.</P>
<P><HI>That they who would be wise unto Salvation, must know the Holy Scriptures: And that for Children to know the Holy Scrip∣tures, is Early Wisdom, and Saving Wisdom.</HI></P>
<P>I can demand their Attention to several <HI>Propositions;</HI> And such too, as it were to be wished, all our Children were well acquainted with.</P>
<P N="1">I. To yield <HI>Obedience</HI> unto God, in the <HI>Wayes</HI> and <HI>Rules</HI> of His Holy Religion; This is to be, WISE UNTO SAL∣VATION.</P>
<P>There is an <HI>Holy Religion,</HI> wherewith we are to <HI>Glorify</HI> GOD in this World. By doing so, we secure our Title to an Eternal <HI>Glory</HI> with God in another and a better World. Now there never was a Truer Assertion, than that; Psal. 111.10. <HI>The Beginning of Wisdom, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Fear of the Lord. All they that give themselves to it, have a good Understanding.</HI> It must needs be our truest <HI>Wisdom,</HI> to <HI>Glorify</HI> the GOD that made us; For by doing so, we Answer the <HI>End</HI> for which He made us. There is nothing so <HI>Reasonable</HI> as to be <HI>Religious.</HI> It must needs be our Truest <HI>Wisdom,</HI> to make sure of <HI>Eternal Glory</HI> in another and better World; For we can be sure of nothing in <HI>this World;</HI> We are sure, that we
<PB N="5" REF="001361_0010_0FB2923E0B906F18"/>
shall shortly be strip't of everything in <HI>this World.</HI> There is nothing so <HI>Profitable,</HI> nothing so <HI>Necessary,</HI> as to be <HI>Reli∣gions.</HI> The <HI>Rules of Religion</HI> are prescribed by the <HI>Only Wise</HI> GOD; The GOD of whom we are assured, Psal. 145.5. <HI>His Understanding is Infinite.</HI> They must needs be <HI>Wise Rules;</HI> It must needs be our <HI>Wisdom</HI> to adhere unto them.</P>
<P>One main stroke in Religion is, FAITH towards our Lord Jesus Christ. <HI>Faith</HI> is in the Bible often called by the Name of, <HI>Wisdom.</HI> 'Tis most Justly called so. It Beholds, It Re∣ceives, It Enjoyes, that Glorious CHRIST, in whom there is, <HI>The Wisdom of God.</HI> And, The <HI>End of our Faith</HI> will be the <HI>Salvation of the Soul.</HI></P>
<P>Another main stroke in Religion is, REPENTANCE towards God. <HI>Repentance</HI> is a <HI>Resipiscence,</HI> of <HI>Growing Wise</HI> again. It must be <HI>Wisdom,</HI> to Abhor <HI>Sin,</HI> to Avoid Sin; <HI>Sin</HI> is always <HI>Folly;</HI> To <HI>Sin,</HI> is to <HI>Do very Foolishly.</HI> And, <HI>Repentance,</HI> This will <HI>be unto Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>There is no man, but what will own, 'Tis the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of every man, to <HI>Save his own Soul:</HI> For, <HI>What is a man profited, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own Soul?</HI> Now the Issue of conformity to the <HI>Rules of Religion,</HI> will be the <HI>Salvation of the Soul.</HI> We read, Heb. 5.9. CHRIST, is <HI>the Author of Eternal Salvation, unto all them that obey Him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. Our KNOWLEDGE OF THE HOLY SCRIPTURES, is that by which we come to know the <HI>Rules of Religion,</HI> and be Religiously <HI>wise unto Salvation.</HI> The <HI>Rules</HI> of our Holy <HI>Religion,</HI> are all of them delivered in those Oracles of God, which we call, <HI>The Holy Scriptures.</HI> If ever we come unto <HI>Salvation,</HI> it must be by conversing with the <HI>Holy Scrip∣tures.</HI> We are so called upon; Joh. 5.39. <HI>Search the Holy Scriptures, for in them ye think, ye have Eternal Life: and they are they who testifie of me.</HI> It was very Fit, that the Will of God, giving us the <HI>Rules</HI> of Living unto Him, should be contain'd in some <HI>Writings</HI> or other. These <HI>Inspi∣red Writings</HI> which we have in our Old and <HI>New Testament,</HI> are the only Ones, that can pretend unto this Dignity. In these <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> we have the <HI>Rules of Religion,</HI> and the <HI>Rules</HI> by the Observation whereof we shall be <HI>wise unto Sal∣vation.</HI> Here, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Gospel,</HI> whereof we are told;
<PB N="6" REF="001361_0011_0FB2C65227C4FFF0"/>
Eph. 1.13. <HI>It is the Gospel of your Salvation.</HI> If we lack the Knowledge of this <HI>Gospel,</HI> we shall miss of <HI>Salvation,</HI> and be <HI>Destroy'd for the lack of Knowledge.</HI> If we do not know the Gospel, we shall be a <HI>people of no understanding;</HI> Of such a people, how terribly it Thunders! <HI>He that made them will not have mercy on them; He that formed them, will show them no Favour.</HI> What is all the Learning in the World, with∣out the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures!</HI> There were (they say) two hundred thousand Books, in the Library which <HI>Ptolomy</HI> Erected at <HI>Alexandria;</HI> but it was the Addition of the <HI>Hoi Scriptures,</HI> which made it a <HI>truly Learned Library.</HI> And whatever we have Learnt from all our <HI>Books,</HI> 'tis the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures,</HI> that will bring us to the Truest, and indeed the only <HI>Learning.</HI> A Dying <HI>Grotius,</HI> or <HI>Selden</HI> will tell you so?</P>
<P>But what sort of <HI>Knowledge</HI> is requisite?</P>
<P>Be sure, A <HI>Doctrinal Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> is requisite, that we may be <HI>VVise unto Salvation.</HI> We read, 2 Cor. 4.3. <HI>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid unto them that be Lost.</HI> We must know <HI>Doctrinally</HI> the main Things that are communicated unto us in the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> The <HI>Creati∣on</HI> of Man by GOD; The <HI>Confusion</HI> of Man by SIN; The <HI>Redemption</HI> of Man by CHRIST. These are the main Things in the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> If we are <HI>Ignorant</HI> of these Things our <HI>Ignorance</HI> will plunge us into Everlasting <HI>Dark∣ness:</HI> Verily, It lays us in <HI>Chains of Darkness?</HI></P>
<P>But then, a <HI>Practical Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> is also requisite, We <HI>know</HI> to little purpose, except we <HI>Do</HI> according to what we <HI>know.</HI> We read, Joh. 13.17. <HI>Since ye know these things, Happy are ye, if you do them. Knowledge</HI> must be as <HI>John Baptist</HI> was to our Saviour, only a <HI>praecursor</HI> to <HI>Goodness;</HI> and we must say, <HI>That which comes after it is preferred before it.</HI> We must <HI>know</HI> the Truth and <HI>VValk <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Truth.</HI> We must <HI>Know</HI> God, and <HI>Serve</HI> Him. We must <HI>Know</HI> Christ, and <HI>Grow in Grace.</HI> The <HI>Lamp</HI> is without <HI>Oyl;</HI> it will go out in Everlasting <HI>Darkness,</HI> if the <HI>Know∣ledge</HI> be not soak'd and dip'd in <HI>Love.</HI> It was the saying of <HI>Maximus Tyrius</HI> long ago; <HI>Scientiae quis usus esse potest, nisi ea agamus?</HI> We must <HI>Know</HI> and <HI>Hear</HI> our Duty, and we must be <HI>Doers</HI> of the Word, and not <HI>Hearers</HI> only. Else we are
<PB N="7" REF="001361_0012_0FB2C65344087C68"/>
not <HI>VVise unto Salvation.</HI> We <HI>foolishly Deceive our selves,</HI> in our Hope of <HI>Salvation,</HI> If we do not <HI>Know practically,</HI> our Knowledge will not render us <HI>VVise unto Salvation.</HI> It will but Aggravate our <HI>Damnation;</HI> and there can be no <HI>Wisdom</HI> in <HI>That.</HI> If we <HI>Rebel against our Light,</HI> it will not be <HI>saving wisdom.</HI> No, It will be a <HI>Folly</HI> that will <HI>Damn</HI> the <HI>Rebellious.</HI> We read, Mat. 7.26. T'is the part of, <HI>A Foolish man, who builds his House on the Sand, and Great is the Fall of it.</HI> It has been well enough sometimes thus expressed, One Apple of the <HI>Tree of Life,</HI> in practice, is of more ac∣count than Ten of the <HI>Tree of Knowledge.</HI> Thus <HI>Homer</HI> makes <HI>Phaenix,</HI> the Tutor of <HI>Achilles,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. It is the <HI>sweet Conjunction</HI> of the <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> that will <HI>gain our point.</HI> A <HI>Conjunction</HI> that infallibly foretells a <HI>Salvation to the ut∣termost.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The Inference from hence is; That the EARLY KNOWLEDGE of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> is the way to be BETIMES <HI>made wise unto Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>And now there is a Twofold APPLICATION to be made of this Observation. We will discourse on this Ob∣servation, by Applying it unto two sorts of persons.</P>
<P N="1">I. It is the Interest of all TEACHERS to <HI>Begin Betimes,</HI> in Teaching of <HI>Children,</HI> the <HI>Early Knowledge</HI> of the HOLY SCRIPTURES, that so they may be WISE UNTO SAL∣VATION. It is to <HI>You,</HI> O TEACHERS; unto You first, there must now come the Word of the Lord. It must come, with an Answer to Divers <HI>Enquiries.</HI></P>
<P>We will, <HI>First,</HI> Enquire, and Declare, WHEN should we <HI>Begin</HI> to <HI>Teach our Children,</HI> the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scrip∣tures?</HI></P>
<P>BETIMES! BETIMES! Let the Children have the <HI>Early Knowledge</HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> That Princely Preacher, the Prince of <HI>Anbalt,</HI> would say; <HI>The Holy Scrip∣tures, what are they but the swadling Clothes of the Holy Child Jesus?</HI> HE is to be found in every Chapter. I will then say, Let us Teach our Children the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> as soon as we can after they come out of their <HI>Swadling Cloaths.</HI> This is the Direction of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> Deut. 6.7. <HI>Thou shall
<PB N="8" REF="001361_0013_0FB2C65603E519D0"/>
teach them diligently unto thy Children.</HI> And Eph. 6.4. <HI>Your Children, Bring them up in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord.</HI> But the HOLY SCRIPTURES have not Expresly said, <HI>How Early,</HI> we shall <HI>Begin to Teach</HI> our Children, the KNOWLEDGE of them. However, we may easily De∣termine it.</P>
<P>First; <HI>How Early</HI> do the Children begin to be <HI>capable</HI> of <HI>Knowing</HI> &amp; <HI>Minding</HI> what is in the HOLY SCRIPTURES? Most certainly we should <HI>Begin as soon as we can. As soon</HI> as the Children can <HI>know, so soon</HI> should we <HI>Teach</HI> them, what they should <HI>know. So much</HI> there is to be Learnt, it is pity any <HI>Time</HI> should be Lost. No doubt, they Began so soon with <HI>Solomon;</HI> Else he would not have said, Prov. 4.3, 4. <HI>I was any Fathers Son, a Tender and only one in the sight of my Mother,</HI> Then <HI>he Taught me.</HI></P>
<P>Again; <HI>How Early</HI> do the Children begin to Know <HI>Other Matters?</HI> Why should we not begin to Teach them some∣thing from the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> that may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them. <HI>[Lae∣ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it hic Infans,] as Early</HI> as we Teach them things <HI>Less</HI> Worthy, <HI>Less</HI> Useful! Can we Teach them, what they have to <HI>us?</HI> Methinks, we may then Teach them, what they owe to the LORD, who made both us and Them? Their Little Souls are precious <HI>Cabinets.</HI> Why should not the <HI>Best</HI> Things be <HI>First</HI> put into them? We are so called upon; Matth. 6.31. <HI>Seek first the Kingdom of God.</HI> Even so, with the <HI>First,</HI> Let them Learn the Things that Concern the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>Once more; <HI>How Early</HI> do the Children Begin to <HI>Know,</HI> and to <HI>Do,</HI> what may be <HI>Hurtful</HI> to them? 'Tis very <HI>Early,</HI> that they Learn the Things <HI>Condemned</HI> in the HOLY SCRIPTURES. Why should they not as EARLY Learn the HOLY SCRIPTURES, which do condemn those per∣nicious and provoking Evils? Why should they not <HI>know</HI> the <HI>Precepts</HI> of God, as EARLY as they know how to <HI>Break</HI> the Precepts? Why should they not be Taught, that they must Fear God, and Love Christ, and Hate Sin, as EARLY as they can Learn to <HI>Sin?</HI> Especially since this would be the way to <HI>preserve</HI> them from <HI>Sin.</HI> A Child no sooner begins to do any thing <HI>Rational,</HI> but <HI>Satan</HI> begins to show it, how to do something that is <HI>Criminal.</HI> Me∣thinks;
<PB N="9" REF="001361_0014_0FB2C657B7C344C0"/>
I see the Image of it; Rev. 12.4. <HI>The Dragon stood to devour the Child as soon as it was born,</HI> Then say I; It becomes us to be <HI>Aforehand</HI> with the <HI>Dragon,</HI> if it be possi∣ble: To stand Ready with the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scrip∣tures,</HI> to rescue the <HI>Children</HI> from the Venomous Designs of the <HI>Dragon</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>There is a plausible Objection, against this <HI>Early Essay,</HI> to give our <HI>Children</HI> the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>Will not this be to make the Children, <HI>Take the Name of the Lord in vain?</HI> Would it not be more <HI>Discretion,</HI> to stay till the <HI>Children</HI> are themselves come to some <HI>Years of Dis∣cretion?</HI></P>
<P>It is Easily Answered. Will you never <HI>Teach</HI> the Chil∣dren, till you see them have the <HI>Grace,</HI> that will keep them from <HI>Taking the Name of the Lord in vain?</HI> Rather <HI>Teach</HI> them, to <HI>Keep</HI> them from it. And let our <HI>Discretion</HI> Teach us to manage the matter <HI>wisely,</HI> in <HI>Teaching</HI> our Children. Teach them with all possible <HI>Gravity;</HI> And Teach them to be <HI>Gra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e,</HI> in every thing, that relates to God, and their Souls. Consider also the <HI>Capacity</HI> of the Children: Teach them, what shall be <HI>Good</HI> for <HI>Them;</HI> And forbear the Rest, until they shall be more <HI>Able to Bear it:</HI></P>
<P>We will, <HI>Secondly,</HI> Enquire, and Declare, WHAT is that <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures,</HI> which we are to <HI>Teach our Children?</HI></P>
<P>Truly, AS MUCH as ever WE CAN help them to; <HI>All</HI> the <HI>Knowledge,</HI> that they can Take in, still as we find them <HI>Able</HI> to Take it in. More particularly▪</P>
<P>First; The HISTORIES of the <HI>Holy Scriptures;</HI> We are to Teach <HI>Them</HI> unto our Children. <HI>Children</HI> are naturally taken with <HI>Histories.</HI> Now, instead of <HI>Corrupt Stories,</HI> and <HI>Idle-Fables,</HI> Why should we not single out the <HI>Histories</HI> in the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> for them? Only, It would be adviseable always to clench the <HI>Histories,</HI> with some <HI>Admonitions of Piety,</HI> which are to be gathered from them. There are none of those <HI>Histories,</HI> but it may be said upon them; Psal. 19.11. <HI>Thy Servant is warned by them.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; We are to Teach our Children the <HI>PRINCI∣PLES</HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> Tell the Children, What the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> have Taught us to Believe thou GOD, and
<PB N="10" REF="001361_0015_0FB2C6595E12A778"/>
His <HI>Perfections,</HI> and His <HI>Works:</HI> About the <HI>Fall</HI> of <HI>Man,</HI> and the Method of his <HI>Recovery</HI> out of that miserable Fall; About the Lord Jesus Christ, <HI>Who</HI> He <HI>is,</HI> &amp; what He <HI>has done,</HI> and what He <HI>will do,</HI> for His Chosen Peo∣ple. We read, That the <HI>Principles of the Doctrine of Christ;</HI> are the <HI>Milk for Babes.</HI> That these things may be the better taught, an Orthodox CATECHISM, is to be Em∣ploy'd. They should say their <HI>Catechism,</HI> and be <HI>Reward∣ed</HI> when they can say it. But then, we should put <HI>Les∣ser Questions</HI> unto them; unto which, their YES, or NO, will give us to perceive, Whether they <HI>understand</HI> what they say. <HI>Canvas<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> the matter with them. Ask them <HI>several things</HI> about it. Cause them to take <HI>much Notice</HI> of it. See whether they have tak'n a <HI>Right No∣tion</HI> of it. We read, 2 Tim. 1.13. There is a <HI>Form of sound words,</HI> which they must hear from us.</P>
<P>Thirdly; We are to Teach our Children the COM∣MANDMENTS of the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> There are the TEN <HI>Commandments.</HI> The Children should be made to know, What is Implied in them, What is <HI>Forbidden,</HI> What is <HI>Required.</HI> How, as it has been of old noted, the <HI>First</HI> Table of the <HI>Commandments,</HI> is a <HI>Loadstone</HI> of the <HI>Second;</HI> the <HI>Second</HI> is a <HI>Touchstone</HI> for the <HI>First.</HI> There are many LESSONS, which are to be inculcated on them; <HI>Lessons</HI> by which their <HI>Manners</HI> are to be regulated▪ GOOD LESSONS FOR CHILDREN may be the Title for them.</P>
<P>But there is one very Great Article, which is often to be insisted on. The <HI>Children</HI> have, mostly, been <HI>Baptised.</HI> O make 'em know the Intent and Meaning of their BAP∣TISM. As soon as ever you can, inform them, that they have been <HI>Baptised!</HI> and beget in them an awful Sense of their <HI>Baptismal Obligations▪</HI> Tell them, <HI>Now, my Child, you must be a Servant of a Glorious CHRIST, and be afraid of Defiling your self with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sin, since you have been wasted in the Name, of the most Holy Lord.</HI> Say to them; as he, 1 Chron. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.9. <HI>My Child, Know thou the God of thy Father, and serve Him with a perfect Heart, and a willing Mind; If thou seek Him, He will be found of thee; but if thou Forsake Him, He will cast thee off for ever.</HI> You cannot imagine, how much Efficacy this <HI>Teaching</HI> may have upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="001361_0016_0FB2C65A8A0C24C0"/>Fourthly; The <HI>Children</HI> should LEARN TO READ the <HI>Holy Scriptures;</HI> and this, as <HI>Early</HI> as may be. To <HI>School</HI> therefore with them. Let them not be Loitering <HI>at home,</HI> or playing <HI>abroad,</HI> when they should be at <HI>School.</HI> Be more concerned for their <HI>Schooling,</HI> than for their <HI>Cloathing.</HI> If there be <HI>any,</HI> as I suppose there cannot be <HI>many,</HI> so necessi∣tous, as to call for it, let us in this Town go on with our CHARITY-SCHOOLS. When the Children can <HI>Read,</HI> the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> charge them, and cause them, <HI>every day</HI> to <HI>Read</HI> that <HI>Book of Life. Hire</HI> them to <HI>Remember</HI> what they Read; To get <HI>Select Sentences</HI> of the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> into their <HI>Memories.</HI> And then; Show them, how to make PRAYERS out of what they <HI>Read.</HI> Help them to turn all into <HI>Prayers,</HI> That they may be <HI>Wise unto Salvation,</HI> Oh, <HI>Teach them to Pray!</HI> When once it comes to be said, <HI>Behold they Pray!</HI> t'is likely, that it may quickly be said, <HI>They are wise unto Salvation.</HI> The Bible was well called, by one of the Ancients, <HI>Epistola Omnipoten<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is Dei ad Creaturam suam.</HI> A <HI>Letter</HI> from the Almighty GOD, unto His Creatures, It should be considered as a <HI>Letter</HI> from the Almighty God unto our <HI>Children.</HI> They should be taught accordingly to <HI>Read</HI> it, and <HI>Reverence</HI> it, and <HI>Answer</HI> it.</P>
<P>This it will be, for the Children to <HI>know the Holy Scrip∣tures.</HI></P>
<P>We will, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Enquire and Declare, WHO it is, that it to <HI>Teach the Children, the knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.</HI> Come ALL HANDS to the Work.</P>
<P>In particular; The PASTORS of the Flock; They must not neglect the <HI>Children</HI> of the Flock. The Charge of our Lord unto them, is that; Joh. 21.15. <HI>Feed my Lambs.</HI> It seems proposed, as if it were, at least, one <HI>Third part</HI> of the <HI>Pastoral Charge.</HI> O men of God, How many ways may you <HI>Devise Good,</HI> in this Great Affair; to make the <HI>Children</HI> under your Charge, <HI>Wise unto Salvation!</HI> In the midst of many such <HI>Devices,</HI> I will mention one, which the Excel∣lent Mr. <HI>White,</HI> in his <HI>Manual for Parents,</HI> has proposed; <Q>That <HI>Ministers</HI> would sometimes <HI>Preach at the Schools,</HI> as well as <HI>Catechise;</HI> Because as he says, <HI>The Preaching of the Word, is the Converting Ordinance.</HI> And when <HI>Sermons</HI> are brought unto the <HI>Schools,</HI> the Children must needs hear
<PB N="12" REF="001361_0017_0FB2C65BF9E165E8"/>
with more Attention, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of such Things as do more <HI>immediately concern</HI> them, which, in the Publick Assem∣blies, are not so much medled withal; and the Ministers should condescend unto such <HI>Expressions</HI> as might work most with them, which would not be so fit for a larger Congregation.</Q></P>
<P>The MASTER and MISTRESS, in the SCHOOL, may do much in this Noble Work. We read, <HI>The Little Ones have their Angels.</HI> Truly, to Teach the <HI>Little Ones,</HI> the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures,</HI> and make them <HI>Wise unto Salvation,</HI> it is a stately work; I had almost call'd it; <HI>A Work for Angels.</HI> It is an <HI>Hard Work</HI> to keep a <HI>School:</HI> and hardly ever duly Recompensed. I suppose, It is easier to be at the <HI>Plough</HI> all day than in the <HI>School.</HI> But it is a <HI>Good Work:</HI> It is <HI>Gods Plough;</HI> and <HI>God speed it!</HI> I would not have you weary of it. <HI>Melchior Adam</HI> did well to call it; <HI>Molestissimam, sed Deo longe gratissimam Functionem;</HI> A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> work, tho' very Tiresome, and Troublesome to the Flesh, yet most highly <HI>Acceptable</HI> to God. Go on with it Chear∣fully; And often Teach the Children something of the <HI>Ho∣ly Scriptures;</HI> often drop some <HI>Honey out of that Rock</HI> upon them. Who can tell, but you may Teach them the Things that shall save their Souls, and they shall bless God for you and with you, throughout Eternal Ages? Every time a New <HI>Child</HI> comes to the <HI>School,</HI> Oh! why should you not think! <HI>Here my Glorious LORD sends me another Object, on which I may do something, to advance His Kingdom in the World!</HI></P>
<P>No, nor will we Excuse the very SERVANTS in the Family, from this Blessed Work; Even the <HI>Handmaids</HI> in the Family, as they are <HI>Dressing</HI> and <HI>Feeding</HI> the <HI>Children,</HI> O Handmaids of the Lord How much may you do, to instlil the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures</HI> into the <HI>Children!</HI> If our <HI>Servants</HI> would once come to take pleasure in such a thing, to keep Teaching the <HI>Children</HI> something from the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> O my <HI>Children,</HI> [for such <HI>Servants</HI> are worthy to be called, <HI>Children!</HI>] How much would you <HI>Adorn the Doctrine of God your Saviour!</HI> It was certainly a good Speech, which I find written by a Person of Quality. <Q>It is certainly, the <HI>Highest Dignity,</HI> if not the <HI>Greatest Hap∣piness,</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001361_0018_0FB2C65E073CE3D8"/>
that Humane Nature is capable of, here in this Vale below, to have a Soul so far Enlightened, as to be∣come the <HI>Mirror,</HI> or <HI>Conduit</HI> or Conveyer of <HI>Gods Truth</HI> to others.</Q> Now, even a Domestick <HI>Servant,</HI> may arrive to this <HI>Dignity,</HI> this <HI>Happiness.</HI> Yea, Let all Ranks of men aspire of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> it.</P>
<P>But; <HI>Lastly,</HI> and yet <HI>First of all,</HI> O PARENTS <HI>Arise; This matter chiefly belongs unto you; we also will be with you.</HI> None, I say, None are so much concerned, as <HI>Parents</HI> to look after it, that their <HI>Children</HI> be taught the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.</HI> Our famous King <HI>Elfred,</HI> procured a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, That every man who had but as much as <HI>Two Hides of La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d;</HI> should bring up his Children to Learning, till Fifteen-Years of Age at least; that so they might <HI>Know Christ, and Live Happily;</HI> Else he said, <HI>They were but Beasts and</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> press it, That <HI>Parents</HI> give their <HI>Children</HI> all the Learning they can; especially that which will bring them to <HI>Know Christ and Live Happily.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Parents,</HI> What <HI>Motive</HI> can you desire more than this? 'Tis the way to make the Children <HI>Wise unto Salvation.</HI> Certainly you Desire the <HI>Salvation</HI> of your <HI>Children.</HI> You have had your share among the Causes of it, that they are <HI>by N<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Children of Wrath.</HI> And would you not see them <HI>Saved</HI> from that <HI>Wrath?</HI> Did you duly Teach your Children the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures,</HI> there would be a like∣lihood of their being those Children; 1 Joh. 2.13. <HI>Little Children ye have known the Father.</HI> And, Oh! what would be the Fruit of this <HI>Knowledge?</HI> Truly, <HI>This is Life Eter∣nal.</HI> You Lodge in the little Souls of your Children, the Seeds of <HI>Life Eternal;</HI> if God please to make them so. What a charming word is that? Gen. 18.19. <HI>He will com∣mand his Children, and they shall keep the way of the Lord.</HI> But if the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures</HI> be withheld from the Children, they perish, they perish dreadfully. If the <HI>Understandings</HI> of the Children be <HI>Darkened,</HI> they will be <HI>Alienated from the Life of God;</HI> They will be <HI>Slaves</HI> to the <HI>Power of Darkness;</HI> They are in the <HI>Broad Way</HI> to E∣ternal <HI>Darkness:</HI> if they <HI>Know not God</HI> &amp; the Lord Jesus Christ, their Doom from the Lord will be, <HI>Depart from me, I know your not.</HI> Oh, Look upon the <HI>Children,</HI> which you

He says, Here, Take this <HI>Child;</HI> Let it be taught the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures.</HI> I will <HI>Reward</HI> all thy pains. Thy well-instructed Child, shall be thy <HI>Comfort,</HI> thy <HI>Credit,</HI> a Bles∣sing to <HI>Others</HI> in the World. If it miss of <HI>Salvation,</HI> yet thou shalt have peace in thy mind, that thou didst thy Endeavour to make it <HI>Wise unto Salvation.</HI> But if it want <HI>Knowledge,</HI> and <HI>Saving Wisdom</HI> thro' any gross Negligence of thine, thy punishment shall be terrible, in the Day of the Lords pleading with thee.</P>
<P><HI>Consider what I say, and the Lord give you understand∣ing,</HI> to do your part, that your <HI>Children</HI> may not want <HI>Understanding,</HI> or <HI>Die without Instruction.</HI> 'Tis the wish of Heaven ever you; Deut. 32.29, <HI>O that they were wise,

that they understood this, that</HI> [so some render it] <HI>they would consider their Posterity.</HI></P>
<P>But then, it is the Interest of all CHILDREN, to Learn the <HI>Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures Betimes,</HI> that so they may be <HI>Wise unto Salvation.</HI> We have many <HI>Children</HI> in the Auditory. I wish the <HI>Little Ones</HI> would now give a great Attention.</P>
<P>This Country once had a Brave man in it, whose Name was Mr▪ <HI>Giles Firmin.</HI> That man was pious, from his Early Childhood. And that which brought him to his Piety was this. When he was a <HI>School-Boy,</HI> he with other Lads went unto the Lectures of the famous <HI>Rogert;</HI> where they could not get into the Thronged Auditory. The Zea∣lous Preacher saw them in the Porch, and lifting up his voice, he call'd unto them. <HI>Children, I hope you are come hither for a Christ; Remember what I say unto you; If you will have a Christ for your Saviour, you shall have him.</HI> This word struck little <HI>Firmin</HI> to the Heart; By this Word, God <HI>Quickened</HI> him; he became a Godly Child, and he dyed not long since, a very <HI>Old man,</HI> and one of the <HI>best</HI> men in the World.</P>
<P>I will now say, <HI>Children,</HI> I hope you are come hither that you may be <HI>made wise unto Salvation.</HI> And if any of <HI>them,</HI> are not Attentive, I hope you that are their <HI>Tutors,</HI> will afterwards Repeat unto them the Admonitions which are now provided for them.</P>
<P><HI>Come, ye Children, Hearken to me, I will teach you,</HI> what you ought to do.</P>
<P>You ought, <HI>First,</HI> To be <HI>Willing</HI> to be <HI>Taught the Fear of the Lord.</HI> When your <HI>Teachers</HI> would Learn you something of the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> be <HI>willing to Learn.</HI> Be not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e to wait upon their Teaching. Do not strive to get away from their Teaching. Be not so set upon your Childish &amp; Foolish <HI>Play,</HI> as to count every <HI>minute</HI> a weary Hour under their Teaching. Rather come to your Teachers, and beg it of them, <HI>I pray, Teach me something.</HI> Oh! Count it a <HI>Pri∣viledge,</HI> to be Taught any thing of the <HI>Holy Scriptures.</HI> Prize, Prize the <HI>Sincere Milk of the Word.</HI> Prize, Prize the Word of God, as being <HI>Sweeter than the Honey and the Ho∣ney-comb.</HI> Count the <HI>Knowledge</HI> of GOD, and CHRIST▪

<P>Yea, <HI>Secondly;</HI> You ought never to be <HI>Satisfied.</HI> Know as much of the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> as ever <HI>you can,</HI> and never count that you know <HI>enough.</HI> Get your <HI>Catechism</HI> exactly by Heart.

<P>But, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> Be sure to <HI>Do</HI> what you <HI>Know</HI> from the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> that you ought to do. As now; Do not you <HI>know</HI> from the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> that you ought to <HI>Keep Holy the Lords Day,</HI> and to <HI>Honour your Parents,</HI> and rather suffer any thing that tell a <HI>Lye:</HI> Do not you <HI>know</HI> from the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> That you ought to <HI>Pray <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Secret</HI> every day, and <HI>Pray without Ceasing?</HI> Oh! <HI>Do</HI> these Things, my Chil∣dren. Be sure to <HI>Do<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> such Things. What have the <HI>Holy Scriptures</HI> told you, concerning <HI>Early Religion?</HI> In them you have heard your Saviour say, Prov. 8.<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>7. <HI>They that seek me early, shall find me.</HI> There the voice of your Saviour in, Matth. 19.14. <HI>Suffer little Children to come unto me, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> Well then, Betimes, now in your <HI>Childhood,</HI> Oh!

<P>Remember; <HI>Children;</HI> There have been many <HI>Children</HI> in the World, who have in their <HI>Early Childhood,</HI> by the <HI>Know∣ledge of the Holy Scriptures,</HI> been <HI>Wise unto Salvation.</HI> You have in your Hands, the <HI>Narratives</HI> of many such, that have been in our Days.

And while he was yet a <HI>Child,</HI> he had so much of GOD in him, that as he lay asleep, his Venerable Father would lay his hand on the Breast of the Child▪ and say with unspeakable Joy; <HI>Here's a Little Temple of God!</HI> And

there was a late Child at <HI>Antioch;</HI> One little more than seven years old; The Lad was Examined about what was in the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> by bloody Persecutors, who stood ready to Murder him; He notably told them, <HI>There can be but One God, and our Christ is the True God;</HI> They ask'd him where he Learn't this; He reply'd, <HI>I Learn't it of my Mother, It was with my Mothers Milk that I suck't it in.</HI> On this, they horribly scourg'd the Lad, and then butch∣ered him with hideous Torments: He smiled under his Torments, and he dyed a Martyr of the Lord. Oh! That our <HI>Children</HI> were so Disposed!</P>
<P>The <HI>Infant-Children</HI> of the Faithful, are the <HI>Children of God.</HI> God calls them; Ezek. 16.21. <HI>My Children.</HI> God forbid, That our <HI>Children</HI> as soon as they come to Act <HI>Rea∣sonably,</HI> should be so <HI>Unreasonable,</HI> as to make themselves, the <HI>Children of Satan.</HI> Children, If you <HI>Hate</HI> that which is Good, if you <HI>Disobey</HI> your Parents, if you Speak <HI>Wicked words,</HI> and call <HI>Wicked Names,</HI> and <HI>Lye,</HI> and <HI>Curse,</HI> if you <HI>Steal,</HI> and if you play on the <HI>Lords-Day;</HI> Whose <HI>Children</HI> are you?

<P>It was the Speech of one that was <HI>Wise Betimes;</HI> Psal. 119.147. <HI>I prevented the Dawning of the morning, and I cried; I hoped in thy Word.</HI> While you are yet <HI>Children,</HI> you must have Piety Rectifying, Sanctifying, Purifying of your <HI>Childhood.</HI> While <HI>Reason</HI> is but upon the <HI>Dawning</HI> with you, there is <HI>Reason</HI> that you should mind <HI>Religion.</HI> There was once an incomparable <HI>Child,</HI> of whom we read, 1 Sam. 3.1. <HI>The Child Samuel ministred unto the Lord.</HI> A <HI>Child,</HI> which was Visited &amp; Possessed by the <HI>Spirit</HI> of God; A <HI>Child,</HI> which quickly answered the Calls of the Holy One; A <HI>Child,</HI> that would leave his Sleep, to hold Com∣munion with the Lord. O most amiable <HI>Child!</HI></P>
<P><HI>Children,</HI> 'Tis your <HI>Dawning</HI> Time. It may be your <HI>Dying</HI> Time. A <HI>Child</HI> once grew very Solid, and was more for his <HI>Book</HI> than for his <HI>Play,</HI> and Pray'd unto God more

than once every day. Being asked the cause, the Child said, <HI>Why, I was in the Burying-place a while ago, and there I saw a Grave shorter than my self! Children,</HI> Go unto the <HI>Burying-place;</HI> There you will see many a <HI>Grave</HI> shorter than your selves. 'Tis now upon Computation found, <HI>That more than half the Children of men Dy before they come to be Seventeen Years of Age.</HI> And what needs any more be said, for your Awakening, to Learn the <HI>Holy Scriptures!</HI></P>
<P>We read of such a thing as that; Isa. 65.20. <HI>The Child shall dy an hundred years old.</HI> You may <HI>Dy</HI> in your <HI>Child∣hood:</HI> But you should be ambitious, that if it should be so, you may <HI>dy an hundred years old;</HI> have as much <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Vertue,</HI> as many men of an <HI>hundred years old.</HI> It was a brave stroke in an Epitaph, on a <HI>Child; Praeterquam aetatem nil puerile fuit.</HI> Some of you can Construe it.

<P><PB N="19" REF="001361_0024_0FB2C66A4B0C7DC0"/>If they don't mind these things, in this more publick Dispensation of them, will you that are their <HI>Teachers,</HI> more privately inculcate such Things upon them?

<P>¶ You shall give me leave to conclude with a very Rea∣sonable COROLLARY.</P>
<P>Worthy of Honour are the TEACHERS that Convey <HI>Wisdom</HI> unto our <HI>Children; Worthy of Double Honour</HI> the Happy Instruments that Convey <HI>Saving Wisdom</HI> to them! There are some whose peculiar <HI>Profession</HI> it is, to assist the <HI>Education of our Children;</HI> and it is therefore their Endea∣vour to give them a <HI>Religious Education.</HI> Their <HI>Employment</HI> is to bestow Useful and Various <HI>Learning</HI> on our Children; but they make their Employment, a precious Advantage to Learn them the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> and make them <HI>Wise</HI> for Eternity.</P>
<P>These our SCHOOL-MASTERS, deserve a great Encou∣ragement. We are not <HI>Wise for our Children,</HI> if we do not greatly Encourage them.</P>
<P>The PARTICULAR PERSONS, who have their <HI>Chil∣dren,</HI> in the Tutelage of Skilful and Careful <HI>School-Masters,</HI> ought to make them suitable <HI>Recompences.</HI> Their <HI>Stipends</HI> are generally far short of their <HI>Deserts.</HI> They deserve <HI>Ad∣ditional Compensations.</HI> Their <HI>pains</HI> are not small. What they <HI>Do</HI> is very Great. And surely our Children are very dear to us, I need not quote <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ripides</HI> to tell you, That they are as the very <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Soul,</HI> unto all Mankind. I can't but observe it with a just Indignation; To <HI>Feed</HI> our Children, To <HI>Cloath</HI> our Children, To do any thing for the <HI>Bodies</HI> of our Children; or perhaps to Teach them some <HI>Trifle</HI> at a <HI>Dancing School,</HI> scarcely worth their Learning, we count no Expence too much; At the same time to have the <HI>Minds</HI> of our Children Enriched with the most valuable <HI>Knowledge,</HI> here, <HI>To what purpose?</HI> is the cry: a <HI>little Expence,</HI> how heavily it goes off! <HI>My Brethren, These things ought not so to be. Well-taught Children</HI> are certainly very much to be accounted of.

When the Mother of the <HI>Graechi</HI> was ask'd for the sight of her <HI>Ornaments,</HI> how instructively did she present her <HI>Two Sons</HI> brought up in Learning and Vertue, as the brightest of all her <HI>Ornaments!</HI> If we were duly sensible, how vast a com∣fort it is, how vast a Concern, to have <HI>Well-taught Chil∣dren,</HI> we should study all the ways imaginable, to express our <HI>Thankfulness</HI> unto the <HI>Teachers</HI> of them. And it will not be complain'd, That a <HI>Mecanai</HI> is to be no where found, but in <HI>Horace's</HI> Poetry. The Christian Emperour <HI>Gratian,</HI> One of the Best men, that ever Sway'd the <HI>Roman Scepter,</HI> conferr'd Riches and Honours on his Master <HI>Ausonius,</HI> and he sent him that agreeable Compliment with them; <HI>Sir,</HI> I <HI>have paid what I Ow'd, and I still Owe, what I have paid.</HI> Language agreeable to the Spirit of <HI>Christianity!</HI> Yea, a <HI>Zeno,</HI> that was a Stranger to it, yet has this recorded in his Commendation, That <HI>he would give his Master, as much again, as the wages he ask'd of him.</HI> I hope, he won't be the only One, that shall have such a thing spoken of him!</P>
<P>And the more <HI>Liberal Provision</HI> the PUBLICK does make for Industrious, Well-accomplished, Well-disposed <HI>School-masters,</HI> the more is the <HI>Publick Wisdom</HI> Testified &amp; Propagated! <HI>Ammi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nus Marcellinus,</HI> the Historian, tho' a great Admirer of <HI>Julian</HI> &amp; of Paganism, yet condemns his prohibition of <HI>School-masters</HI> unto the <HI>Christians: Illud autem inclemens obruen∣dum perenni silentio, quod arcebat docere, Magistros Rhetori∣cos et Grammaticos, Ritus Christiani Cultores.</HI> But, Syr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, If you do not <HI>Encourage</HI> your <HI>School-masters,</HI> you do a part of <HI>Julianism,</HI> and as bad as <HI>Prohibit</HI> them.

<P>I shall not presume to Dictate, upon this matter, or to Enquire, Why <HI>Castalio's Dialogues,</HI> be not Look'd upon as one of the best <HI>School-Books,</HI> for the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue, in all the World? Or, Why for the <HI>Greek,</HI> there is no more Ac∣count made of <HI>Posselius?</HI> Or, indeed why (to express my
<PB N="24" REF="001361_0029_0FB2C6734396D6A8"/>
self in the Terms of a Modern Writer) <Q>there should not be <HI>North-west Passage</HI> found, for the Attaining of the <HI>Latin Tongue;</HI> that instead of a Journey, which may be dispatch'd in a few Day, they may not wander like the Chil∣dren of <HI>Israel,</HI> Forty years in the Wilderness. And why they should so much converse with the Poets, at that Age, when they read them, with so much Difficulty, and so little Relish.</Q> But I will venture upon it, as neither a Tedious Parenthesis, nor a needless Digression, to single out only Two passages of many this way which in my small Reading I have met withal.</P>
<P>The first is this; I have seen this Experiment among o∣thers recorded of one that had a Number of Little Folks under his Charge.</P>
<P><Q>Moreover, He made it his Custome, that in every <HI>Reci∣tation,</HI> he would, from something or other occurring in it, <HI>make an occasion,</HI> to let fall some <HI>Sentence,</HI> which had a Tendency to promote the <HI>Fear of God</HI> in their Hearts; which thing sometimes did indeed put him to more than a little study; but the Good Effect sufficiently Recompen∣ced it.</Q></P>
<P>Another is this. A late Writer ha's these words; <Q>Ma∣ny Children are sooner taught what <HI>Jupiter, Mars,</HI> &amp; such Pagan Gods were, then what, <HI>Father, Son, and Spirit</HI> is. <HI>Augustine</HI> of old complain'd of this; of Learni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g in the Schools, <HI>Joves</HI> Adulteries; and for giving an Account of such things, saith he, <HI>ob hoc bonae spei puer appellabar. Luther</HI> also complained, That our Schools were more <HI>Pa∣gan</HI> than <HI>Christian.</HI> I refer the unsatisfied Reader, to <HI>Pa∣sors</HI> Preface to his <HI>Lexicon.</HI> I knew an aged and famous School-master; that after he had kept School about Fifty years, said, with a very sad countenance, That it was a great Trouble to him, that he had spent so much time in Reading Pagan Authors to his Scholars, and wish'd it were customary to read such a Book as <HI>Duports</HI> Verses up∣on <HI>Job,</HI> rather than <HI>Homer,</HI> and such Books. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> God, put it in the Heart of a Wise Parliament, to <HI>Purge our Schools;</HI> that instead of Learning vain Fictions, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>il∣thy Stories, they may be acquainted with the Word of God, and with Books containing Grave Sayings, and
<PB N="25" REF="001361_0030_0FB2C67899B70200"/>
things that may make them truly Wise and Useful in the World.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Ye have heard,</HI> what MY MASTER was, <HI>In the School.</HI> Sir <HI>Walter Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leign</HI> commends it as a piece of wisdom, to use great <HI>moderation</HI> when we are treating men with <HI>Com∣mendation.</HI> I will not forget the Rule, in carrying on my Commendation of <HI>my Master.</HI> But I will say very <HI>much in a Little.</HI> Out of the <HI>School,</HI> he was One, <HI>Antiqua <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>;</HI> A Christian of the <HI>Old Fashion:</HI> An OLD NEW-ENGLISH CHRISTIAN: And I may tell you. That was as Venerable a Sight, as the World; since the Dayes of <HI>Primitive Christianity,</HI> has ever look'd upon.</P>
<P>He was well Studied in the <HI>Body of Divinity:</HI> An Able Defender of the <HI>Faith and Order of the Gospel;</HI> Notably Conversant and Acquainted with the <HI>Scriptural Prophecies;</HI> And, by Consequence, <HI>A Sober Chiliast.</HI></P>
<P>He Lived as a <HI>Master,</HI> the Term, which has been for a∣bove three thousand years, assign'd for the Life of a <HI>Man;</HI> he continued unto the <HI>Ninety Fourth</HI> year of his Age, an unusual Instance of <HI>Liveliness.</HI> His <HI>Intellectual Force,</HI> as little abated as his <HI>Natural.</HI> He Exemplified the Fulfil∣ment of that word, <HI>As thy Days, so shall thy Strength be;</HI> in the Gloss which the <HI>Jerusalem Targum</HI> has put upon it; <HI>As thou wast in the Dayes of thy Youth, such thou shalt be in thy Old Age.</HI> The Reward of his <HI>Fruitfulness!</HI> For, <HI>Fructus Liberat Arborem!</HI> The product of his <HI>Temperance;</HI> Rather than what my Lord <HI>Verulam</HI> assigns, as a Reason for <HI>Viva∣cious Scholars.</HI></P>
<P>DEATH must now do its part. <HI>He Dy'd,</HI> Longing for <HI>Death.</HI> Our old SIMEON waited for it, that he might get nearer to the <HI>Consolation of Israel. He Dyed</HI> Leaning like Old <HI>Jacob,</HI> upon a <HI>Staff;</HI> the <HI>Sacrifice</HI> and the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of a Glorious CHRIST, he let us know, was the <HI>Golden Staff,</HI> which he Lean'd upon. <HI>He Dyed</HI> mourning for the Quick <HI>Apostasie,</HI> which he saw breaking in upon us; very easie about his own Eternal Happiness, but full of Distress for a poor People here under the Displeasure of Heaven, for <HI>Former Iniquities,</HI> he thought, as well as <HI>Later,</HI> Ones. To say no more:
<PB N="26" REF="001361_0031_0FB2C67ACA8EF8F0"/>
He Dyed, A CANDIDATE FOR THE FIRST RESUR∣RECTION. And Verily, our Land is Weakened, when those Fly away, at whose Flight me may cry out, <HI>My Father, My Father, the Chariots of</HI> New-England, <HI>and the Horsemen thereof.</HI></P>
