<L>COME listen awhile, and I'll sing you a ditty,</L>

<L>As what I'm beginning to tell by and by;</L>
<L>It's all about Blunder O'Whack of Kilkenny,</L>

<L>So set off and walk'd all the way in a ship.</L>

<L>Who died in the morning one night t'other day,</L>
<L>And he very civily left me all his money,</L>
<L>Because, why, he could'nt well take it away;</L>
<L>So when I had money I rode it in chaises,</L>
<L>And look'd very big upon those who had none,</L>
<L>For he that has no cash may walk if he pleases,</L>
<L>Or if that don't please him, why then he must run.</L>
</LG>
<P>With my whack, &amp;c.</P>
<LG>
<L>So to London I came, and I thought it so pretty,</L>
<L>To see the folks crowding along in the street,</L>

Where a body may walk from the strand to the city,</L>
<L>And run up against ev'ry soul that you meet;</L>
<L>And then there's the gentry so nate and so nimble,</L>
<L>As if to the business they born were and bred,</L>
<L>Who can slip off a watch, or a purse, or a thimble,</L>
<L>Or your pockets can pick of the hat off your head.</L>
</LG>
<P>With my whack, &amp;c.</P>
<LG>
<L>Then there's Hugh's and Astley's odd whimseys and capers,</L>
<L>Where horses have every perfection but speech,</L>
<L>And the jockies all ride as you read in the papers,</L>
<L>On three horses at once with a leg upon each;</L>
<L>And then there's your sieges <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> battles so clever,</L>
<L>Where wooden battalions all join in the strife,</L>
<L>And soldiers of pasteboard each other dissever,</L>
<L>And all the dead men look as natural as life.</L>
</LG>
<P>With my whack, &amp;c.</P>
<LG>
<L>Then for Dublin I travell'd all night and all day,</L>
<L>While the ship in the water was led such a dance,</L>
<L>That somehow we found she'd mistaken her way,</L>
<L>And instead of dear Dublin we landed in France;</L>
<L>Where if a man dare his opinion to mention,</L>
