<P>The libel of Josiah Basden commander of the private sloop of war called the Favorite, on be∣half of himself and all others interested, against a certain ship called the Two Friends, her cargo and lading,</P>

<P>THAT his most sacred majesty, George the Third, king of Great Britain, and so forth, by

his commission under the seal of this honoura∣ble court, bearing date the twelfth day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety five, di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> grant, com∣mission to, licence and authorised the said Jo∣siah Basden to set forth, in a warlike manner, the said sloop under his own command, and by force of arms to apprehend, seize and take by and with the said sloop and the crew of the same, the men of war, ships, goods and effects belonging to France or others inhabiting within their countries, territories or dominions of France, and to bring the same into such port as shall be most convenient, in order to have them legally adjudged in such Admiralty court as should be lawfully authorized within the British dominions, and the same ships, vessels and goods so finally adjudged and condemned in such sort and man∣ner as by the course of the admiralty has been accustomed, to sell and dispose of as by the said commission may more fully appear. And the libellant sheweth, that pursuant to his said com∣mission, the said Josiah Basden in and with the said sloop and the crew of the same, on the high seas and within the jurisdiction of this ho∣norable court, on or about the first day of Au∣gust, in the year of our Lord one thousand se∣ven hundred and ninety five, in the latitude of thirty eight degrees north, and longitude of six∣ty three degrees west from the meridian of London, did meet with, seize and take a cer∣tain ship, called the Two Friends, of the bur∣then of three hundred and seventy tons, com∣manded by one Samuel Williams, and laden with wine, brandy, and sundry other articles of merchandize, and hath brought the same in∣to this port for legal adjudication and condem∣nation
<PB N="6" REF="029667_0006_0FE215C4A9489A80"/>
as prize; for that the said ship Two Friends, together with the cargo and lading thereof at the time of capture, did wholly or in part belong to subjects of France, or others in∣habiting within their countries, territories or dominions, and that the said ship was bound on a voyage from Nantz, in France, a port in the possession of the French, enemies of our sove∣reign lord the king, to some port on the conti∣nent of the United States of America—And the libellant sheweth, that the cargo of the said ship is of the growth, produce and manufacture of France—And also, that the said ship Two Friends, at the time of her capture, was found without and actually had not all such necessary true and genuine papers and documents as trad∣ing vessels are required to be furnished with in time of war, for the more certain substantiating the true and undoubted property of and in the said vessel and cargo, but also, that the papers so found on board are false and colourable:—Whereby and by reason of all and singular the said premises, and by virtue of the said commis∣sion so granted as aforesaid to the said Josiah Basden, and of his majesty's instructions accom∣panying the same, the said ship Two Friends, together with her tackle, apparel, furniture, boats and lading and every thing else on board are became forfeited, and being first adjudged and condemned as lawful prize, are to be dis∣posed of agreeable to the law and powers in the said commission granted the same as if they were the vessel and effects of open enemies. Where∣fore the said libellant humbly prays, that by the sentence and decree of this honorable court the said ship Two Friends, with her cargo and lading and every thing else on board at the time
<PB N="7" REF="029667_0007_0FE215CB73323F38"/>
of capture, may be adjudged and condemned as lawful prize to the use of the said Josiah Basden and the owners, officers and crew of the said private sloop of war, called the Favorite, ac∣cording to the laws of nations, the right of arms, and the said commission.</P>

<SALUTE>Honored Sir,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE ship Two Friends being at last re∣paired and ready for sea, I have now the hon∣our to enclose you herein invoice and bill of lading of sundry merchandizes, shipped on your account and risque, amounting to livres assignats 404056 3. As also, invoice and bill of lading of sundry goods shipped on account of the un∣derwriters of the cargo of the Two Friends, amounting to livres, assigs. 250895 18 with ac∣count sales and necessary papers for your prompt recovery from them.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="029667_0038_0FE21625717289F0"/>
I further enclose you a bill on my brother for 1000 dollars.—As also a receipt from Capt. Williams for 900 dollars, which he will deliver you immediately after his arrival.</P>
<P>Your ships delay here has been unfortunately very long, but taking into consideration the ma∣ny difficulties under which the laboured it is not too long a time. Mr. S. cannot well form an idea to himself of the tedious manner of doing business here, who is accustomed to so much ac∣tivity. In order to get a single permit for goods it requires two or three days at least, and the number of holidays which at present are kept in France makes mercantile business very difficult to be transacted.—On Sunday the people do not any business and on Decade-days all public offi∣ces are shut.</P>
<P>I am extremely sorry it is impossible for me to return in the ship Two Friends, as there still remains about sixty hogsheads of tobacco unsold; and I should not wish to leave France without having the accounts of the voyage completed. From appearances tobacco will raise considera∣bly in value and is in demand.</P>
<P>I dare say should the Two Friends arrive safe in port, the merchandize which I have shipped on your account will answer very well, as goods of the same kind are seventy or eighty per cent dearer now than they were at the time of pur∣chase. I hope Capt. Mc. C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, of the ship Iris, may have arrived safe at New-York with the goods shipped on your account.</P>
<P>My apprehensions respecting war with Great-Britain are very considerable, notwithstanding (as is reported here) a treaty has been ratified in England by Mr. Jay. The British cruizers take all American vessels bound to France load∣ed
<PB N="39" REF="029667_0039_0FE2162C806D7B58"/>
with provisions. A brig belonging to Mr. Meade of Philadelphia, and cleared out for Nantz, was boarded by an English frigate in the bay; who put a prize-master and several men on board to carry her into Portsmouth: But the captain and American seamen who were left in the brig found means to make drunk the prize-master and his men—In which time they retook possession of the vessel and brought her safe in here.</P>
<P>The late Dauphin of France is dead and Lux∣embourg is taken by the French:—The death of the son of Capet will occasion some altera∣tion with respect to some of the powers at war with France.—The Spanish government de∣manded as one of their terms on which it would agree to a peace, the delivery of the dauphin up to them—some suspicions are at this time form∣ed of his not dying a natural death.</P>
<P>A serious fire took place a few days ago, at Paimboeuf, by which six fine ships were burnt, as you will see by the account given in the Nantz papers. I wished much for a few lines from you, but I suppose you expected my de∣parture from this before the arrival of the ves∣sels which sailed not long since from Philadel∣phia. Please accept the inclosed papers from</P>

<PB N="62" REF="029667_0062_0FE2166ED91B69F8"/>
twenty five silk shawls, one dozen silk handker∣chiefs, fourteen dozen and an half of men's and women's kid skin gloves, between three and four hundred dollars in specie, three silk umbrellas, one fowling piece, one hanger, and one new ma∣hogany desk; he knoweth not in particular what the mate has, an apprentice of this respon∣dant's has as his adventure two dozen of silk umbrellas; the respondant was the master of the said ship taken, he first saw the said vessel at P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>i∣ladelphia, where she was built in the month of May, one thousand seven hundred and ninety four.</P>
<P>To 7th interrogatory, The name of the said ship taken is the Two Friends, and has been cal∣led by that name ever since she was built—the said ship had a (sea brief) or sea letter on board which was obtained at Philadelphia.

<P>To 8th interrogatory, At the time the said vessel sailed from her last clearing port as afore∣said, she had on board wine, dry goods, cur∣rants, raisins, prunes, he cannot ascertain the particular quantity of either of the said articles, as his books and bills of lading are all delivered out of his possession; there was also on board nine hundred dollars in specie, nineteen gold watches, and twenty silver ditto, which goods and articles were on board at the time the ves∣sel
<PB N="63" REF="029667_0063_0FE2167743919AD0"/>

<P>To 10th interrogatory, There was a bill of sale made from James Doughty, the builder of the said ship, to the aforesaid Mr. Swanwick and Alexander Forster, the said Mr. Forster after∣wards sold his part of the said ship to the said Mr. Swanwick.</P>
<P>To 11th interrogatory, The cargo was all brought on board of the said ship, in lighters from Nantz while lying in the river.</P>
<P>To 12th interrogatory, The lading on board of the said ship at the time she was seized and taken, was shipped by John K. Helmuth, he is an American, but was then at Nantz, and went out supercargo of the said ship from Philadelphia, the lading was to have been delivered at Phila∣delphia, for and on the account, risk, and bene∣fit of the aforesaid Mr. John Swanwick, and the underwriters of the ships outward cargo from America, some part of which being damaged in the voyage to France was there sold for the ac∣count of the underwriters, and the proceeds re∣mitted on their account, the whole of which was consigned to the said Mr. Swanwick. The respondant does take upon himself to swear that he believeth that at the time of the lading the cargo and at this present time, and also if the said goods shall be restored and unladen at the
<PB N="64" REF="029667_0064_0FE2167914A92B58"/>
destined port, the goods, did, do and will belong to the persons now asserted to be the owners and to none others.</P>
<P>To 13th interrogatory, The respondant sign∣ed three or four bills of lading, he is not certain which, for the goods shipped on Mr. Swanwick's account, and believeth the same were signed for the goods on the account of the underwriters of the outward cargo brought out in the said ship; neither of which were false or colourable, nor were there any differing in any respect from, those found on board at the time the vessel was taken, he does not recollect whether he signed any bill of lading for the nine hundred dollars in specie on board, but they were deli∣vered to him by the aforesaid John K. Helmuth to be delivered to Mr. Swanwick at Philadel∣phia, as his the said Mr. Swanwick's property.</P>
<P>To 14th interrogatory, There are not in Great Britain any bills of lading, invoices or in∣struments, relating to the said ship or goods, to his knowledge.</P>
<P>To 15th interrogatory, There was not any charter party signed for the voyage.</P>
<P>To 16th interrogatory, At the time the said vessel sailed from her last clearing port, she had on board a register and other usual ships papers, and letters he supposes containing invoices of the cargo, and many other letters and news pa∣pers, no papers were burnt, torn, thrown over∣board, destroyed or cancelled, concealed or at∣tempted to be concealed.</P>
<P>To 17th interrogatory, The said ship has ne∣ver been seized as prize before her present cap∣ture.</P>
<P>To 18th interrogatory, The respondant has not as yet sustained any loss himself, but the ship
<PB N="65" REF="029667_0065_0FE2167AA053D930"/>
has sustained damage by the capture and detenti∣on, but he cannot now ascertain what he has or may suffer by the capture and detention of the said ship and her lading, he has not received or been promised any indemnity or satisfaction for any damage he has or may sustain by the said capture and detention.</P>
<P>To 19th interrogatory, He believeth the ves∣sel was insured out and home, and further know∣eth not.</P>
<P>To 20th interrogatory, In case the vessel had arrived at her destined port, and the cargo there unladen, it would have become the property of the aforesaid Mr. Swanwick, and the underwri∣ters as beforementioned.</P>
<P>To 21st interrogatory, Some part of the wine on board of the said ship is of the growth and produce of France, the other wine and the other goods he knoweth not of what country they are the growth or produce of.</P>
<P>To 22d interrogatory, The lading was all brought on board of the vessel in lighters from Nantz at different times.</P>
<P>To 23d interrogatory, Bills <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ding for the goods shipped on board of the said vessel were to have been forwarded from France to Phila∣delphia.</P>

<P>To 27th interrogatory, The ships papers, bills of lading, and other papers, were true and fair, to the best of his knowledge, as he knew of none being false or colourable, or of any matter to affect their credit;—the sea brief (or sea letter) was obtained from the custom house at Phila∣delphia by this respondant, and was obtained for this vessel only, and oath was made to the same by this respondant, as is therein described, and was not delivered in fact without his having made such oath, he does not recollect what see was paid for the same.</P>
<P>To 28th interrogatory, Answered in the an∣swers to the 14th and 23d interrogatories.</P>
<P>To 29th interrogatory, At the time the said ship was pursued and taken, she was steering a course for Philadelphia—the course was not al∣tered
<PB N="67" REF="029667_0067_0FE216848E8846A0"/>
upon the appearance of the vessel, by which they were taken; the course was at all times as the wind and weather permitted, direct∣ed for Philadelphia, for which place the vessel was destined.</P>
<P>To 30th interrogatory, There was a transfer made from Mr. Forster, who formerly owned one half of the said ship to Mr. Swanwick, for his part of her, but for what sum or considerati∣on he knoweth not; which transfer was truly and fairly made, and not for the purpose of co∣vering or concealing the real property, and that if the said ship shall he restored she will belong to the said Mr. Swanwick, and to no other person.</P>
<P>To 31st interrogatory, No guns were mounted on board of the said vessel or any arms or am∣munition belonging to her, or any on board, ex∣cept a fowling piece, and an hanger, which be∣longs to this respondant, nor were there any mi∣litary or naval stores on board.</P>
<P>To 32d interrogatory, What this respondant has declared is all that he knoweth or believeth according to the best of his knowledge and be∣lief, regarding the real and true property and destination of the said vessel and cargo, concern∣ing which he has now been examined to the time of the capture.</P>

<P>THE ship Two Friends whereof you are mas∣ter, being now loaden and ready for sea, you will proceed with her with all possible dispatch, for the port of Nantz or Bourdeaux, in France, which ever you can most conveniently attain, and on your arrival there deliver your cargo a∣greeably to bills of lading, to Mr. J.

<PB N="71" REF="029667_0071_0FE216915C742248"/>
to sell and take in a back cargo there, in which case you must even go on to such other port as Mr. Helmuth may direct, and as may be most for my interest; so soon as your outward cargo is unloaded you will with all possible dis∣patch take on my account, a return cargo of salt, brandy, wine, oil, soap, prunes, and any other articles Mr. Helmuth may furnish, and proceed back here with such freight, goods or passengers as may offer, and you can take with∣out endangering my property on board—in all things write me constantly of your proceedings, take good care of your vessel and stores, and make every dispatch in your power, the suc∣cess of the voyage depends greatly on this.</P>
<P>Should any accident happen to Mr. Helmuth you must open my letters for him, and act as he would have done; but this I hope will not oc∣cur, and in that case you must consult with him, and in all things act together for the best of my interest, and in case of accident take care to leave your papers regularly made out to recover from the underwriters.</P>

<P>Having perused and duly considered the libel of Jo∣siah Basden, commander of the private sloop of war called the Favorite, as well in name of himself as on the part of the owners, officers and crew of, and belonging to the said sloop, against a certain ship or vessel called the Two Friends, and her cargo, where∣of one Samuel Williams, was late master, and the claim of the said Samuel Williams, for the same; and having attentively examined the an∣swers of the said Samuel Williams, and others, taken on the standing interrogatories, together with the several papers and documents captured with and on board the said ship Two Friends, and exhibited in this cause. And having ob∣served all and singular the matters and things that by law in this behalf ought to be observed, according to the style, manner and practice of this court, it appears to me that the cargo aforesaid is liable to forfeiture, although I am not so fully satisfied respecting the arguments urged against the ship—I do therefore ac∣quit the said ship, with her boats, tackle, apparel and furniture, together with the pri∣vate adventure and money of the said mas∣ter, also the private adventures of the mari∣ners belonging to the said ship; and I do here∣by sentence and decree that the said ship so cal∣led the Two Friends, with her boats, tackle, apparel and furniture, and the adventures and money aforesaid, be restored to the said claim∣ant,
<PB N="87" REF="029667_0087_0FE1BE655A74A4E0"/>
to and for the use and behoof of himself and all others therein severally interested—and, I do further sentence and decree, that all the cargo and lading of the said ship Two Friends, (except as before excepted) be, and the same are hereby adjudged and condemned as lawful prize to and for the use of the said libellant, the own∣ers, officers and crew of the said sloop Favorite; and that the said cargo and lading be delivered to the said captors, or to their agent or agents, he or they paying to the said claimant from the whole of the said condemned cargo, a reasona∣ble freight for the same, on account of the own∣ers of the said ship Two Friends—and I do or∣der that the costs of suit be paid by the claim∣ant.</P>

ship may be sold by the court—Whereupon the court ordered that the Messrs. Perot's, originally offered, should be admitted on the part of the claimant, to prevent the ship's being sold for much less than her real value, which as appear∣ed, might be the case in the present instance, if the court should issue an order for the sale of said ship.</P>

<P>By his excellency James Craufurd, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Captain Ge∣neral, Governor, Command∣er in Chief, and Vice Ad∣miral of these islands.</P>
<P>To all to whom this pre∣sent writing or instrument of protest shall come, greet∣ing:</P>
<P><HI>James Craufurd.</HI> L.S.</P>
<P>KNOW YE, that this third day of November, one thousand seven hundred and ninety five, before me the governor, personally appeared Capt. Samuel Williams, master of the ship Two Friends, who being duly sworn on the Holy Evangelists of Almighty God, deposeth and saith, that he sailed from Nantz, in France, on the twenty first day of June last past, (as master of the said ship) bound for Philadelphia, in the United States of America, with a cargo consisting of wine, fruit, dry goods, some gold and silver watches, nine hundred dollars in spe∣cie, and sundry other articles of merchandize, (all belonging to citizens of the said United States) and having also on board fourteen passen∣gers. That after such his departure, nothing of moment occurred till the second day of August, when in latitude 38, 40, and in longitude 72,0, West from London, he was boarded by a Ber∣mudian privateer sloop, called the Favorite, and commanded by Capt. Josiah Basden, who de∣manded the appearer's papers and afterwards took out the greatest part of the appearer's crew, putting on board a prizemaster and crew of his
<PB N="101" REF="029667_0101_0FE216E7B54EB698"/>
own, and ordering them to proceed with the ship Two Friends for Bermuda, where she ar∣rived on the 15th of the same month.—And the appearer saith that the captors proceeded the next day to search the trunks and baggage of the passengers, but found nothing except their apparel and bedding—That on the seventeenth the Two Friends was libelled in the court of vice admiralty for these islands, with her cargo, as French property, and her hatches sealed up —That on the twenty first, the marshal of the said court, with the captain and agent of the said privateer, visited the said ship and carried ashore the watches and money before mention∣ed, and also examined the appearer's trunks, but took nothing out of them—And the appearer further saith, that on the seventh and eighth of September the before named persons, with seve∣ral others, came on board the Two Friends and overhauled the trunks and casks of dry goods and hoisted up some of the casks of wine, after which they stowed away the wine and dry goods, and sealed up the hatches again—And the appearer further deposeth and saith, that having thought it necessary to employ a proctor, the said proctor did on the third of September (at the request and in behalf of the appearer) interpose a claim for the said ship and cargo, as neutral property, belonging to certain citizens of the United States of America, as afore∣said —That on the eleventh of the said month the cause was argued before the honora∣ble John Green Esquire, judge of the said court, who on the sixteenth promulged his decree, thereby ordering restoration of the said ship Two Friends to the claimant, together with the pri∣vate adventures belonging to the appearer and his crew, but condemning the cargo of the said ship, as lawful prize to the captors, subject to the
<PB N="102" REF="029667_0102_0FE216E94A423498"/>
payment of freight, and burthening the claim∣ant with costs of suit—That the appearer con∣ceiving the said decree to be highly oppressive and unjust (inasmuch as the whole of the pro∣perty ought, in his opinion, to have been ac∣quitted and the captors condemned in costs and damages for the illegal capture thereof,) thought fit to appeal therefrom to the high court of ap∣peals in Great-Britain, whereupon the captors, with a professed design of harrassing and embar∣rassing the appearer, and of deterring him, if possible, from perfecting such appeal, entered a cross-appeal for the said ship and freight, in con∣sequence of which a warrant was issued, autho∣rizing certain persons to appraise the said ship and cargo—That the said appraisers having made their return to the court of their valuation of the said ship (but not of the cargo) the appearer attended the said judge Green on the twenty ninth of September (when Samuel Ewing was also present) for the purpose of sti∣pulating for the said ship at her appraised value, and offered Messrs. James and William Perot, one of the most respectable houses in these islands, as the appearer has been informed, for his secu∣rities; the said James Perot attending at the same time with the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r; but the appearer saith, that the competency of the said James and William Perot, was nevertheless object∣ed to, on the part of the captors, and their security rejected by the court—That the said captors, at the same time, offered to take the said ship at her valuation, and to give good and sufficient security for the same, and actual∣ly named the persons they should produce as their security, whom the court agreed to accept, but that after a delay of several days on the
<PB N="103" REF="029667_0103_0FE216EAD87BFD78"/>
part of the captors, the appearer's proctor press∣ed the court, either to oblige the said captors to stipulate with security, for the value of the said ship, as they had undertaken to do, or to dis∣miss their appeal, they having neglected to com∣ply with their engagement and insisting to have the vessel sold under the direction of the court, for the most she would yield, but that the judge of the said court refused to grant such motion, declaring however, that he would accept the ap∣pearer's security—That the appearer according∣ly again produced his security on the twentieth of October, by which means he got possession of his ship, which the captors, as the appearer chargeth, strove all in their power to prevent. —And the appearer complaineth and saith, that when he, the appearer, attended the said judge of the court of vice-admiralty the first time, with his security, for the value of the said ship, his proctor and counsel, Benjamin Dickinson Harvey, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> in order to keep the court within the strict rules of fair practice, and that no un∣due advantage may be taken by the captors, par∣ticularly cautioned the court, by no means to suffer any proceeding to be had relative to the cargo of the said ship, (the appraisement of which was not finished at that time, or return∣ed) without his being duly notified thereof, to the end that he may have an opportunity of making all just exceptions either as to the insuf∣ficiency of the security, which might be prof∣fered therefore by the captors, or otherwise, which the said judge promised should be done, but that the said judge nevertheless admitted the security for the said cargo (which the ap∣pearer avers was valued very much below its real value) without the consent or privity of the
<PB N="104" REF="029667_0104_0FE216ED4B1D8CF0"/>
appearer or his said proctor, who would certain∣ly have objected to such security upon the ground of its insufficiency, as the persons of whom it consisted, were, as the appearer has been informed, and verily believes to be true, interested in the said privateer, and of course, not such security as the law requires.—That when the appearer's said proctor, heard of this transaction, which was not till several days af∣ter it had taken place, he remonstrated with great warmth to the said judge against the im∣propriety and injustice of the measure, which the said judge never once attempted to justify or defend, but declared that he would act differ∣ently in future—And the appearer further saith, that when his said proctor obtained a sight of the appraisement of the said cargo, he insisted that more particularity ought to have been ob∣served with respect to the dry goods, and also pointed out the great deficiency in the cargo, and in an especial manner, that a certain quan∣tity of staves (part of the outward cargo) which the agent of the privateer had actually taken out of the Two Friends, and converted to his own use, were in no wise accounted for, whereupon the said judge promised to attend to these seve∣ral exceptions, but has failed so to do, save on∣ly that he has caused some of the said staves to be since added to the appraisement of the said cargo—And the appearer moreover saith, that according to the best of his belief, he can, and does aver, that at the time of the capture of the said ship Two Friends, by the said sloop Fa∣vorite, her cargo, and particularly her wine and fruit were in prime order, the appearer having taken care to afford all the air in the hold that he possibly could, and that such was also the
<PB N="105" REF="029667_0105_0FE216F4763C3F30"/>
case, when the said ship arrived in these islands, but that from the length of time the said ship has lain in port in this warm climate, with her hatches sealed up, the said wine and fruit have received very material injury, which has great∣ly reduced the value of each. And in like manner also appeared John Harper, mate, and William Knight, a mariner of, and belonging to the said ship Two Friends, who solemnly made oath, that what the before named Samuel Wil∣liams has herein before declared, is strictly true. —Wherefore the said Samuel Williams, com∣plaining of the several matters and things here∣in set forth, protests against the same, and more especially he protests formally, publicly and so∣lemnly, against the captain, officers, owners, a∣gents and crew of the said privateer, and also against the judge of the said court of vice-ad∣miralty, for all costs, delays, detentions, detri∣ments, damages, demurrages, losses, charges, expences, vexations, spoliations, wastes and in∣juries, of what nature or kind soever, which have already been occasioned, or shall, or may hereafter be occasioned, or sustained by reason of the premises, the appearer hereby ex∣pressly reserving to himself the privilige of am∣plifying his present protest, or of making any o∣ther protest or protests, which he may be ad∣vised to make, or which the nature of his case may require—And persevering in the said pro∣test, the appearers aforesaid, have hereunto set their hands.</P>

<P>In this place the Citizen Dobree, said that there was yet forty seven hogsheads of tobacco belonging to the same cargo, which he thought ought not to be put together with the damaged ones, because he was of opinion, that by picking up the rotten part out of the good, and defalca∣ting accordingly, he can sell them as merchant and good; but however, he would take nothing on his own account, that he thinks that it is the interest of the owners and insurers to have them visited by juries, in order to have their advices, and which he requested, as well as the Citizen Goyau, that we would appoint immediately ju∣ries, to visit the said tobacco, and to have from them their proceeding, stating the quality of the said tobacco, and has signed with us the said Goyau. Signed to the minute. P. F. Dobree, and Goyau.</P>
<P>Of which said requisitions and declarations we above said judge have given act, according∣ly we have appointed and impanelled the Ci∣tizens Brulard and Sauwervald, juries, and in∣vited them to repair to the place assigned them by their commission, have appeared and sworn to
<PB N="125" REF="029667_0125_0FE2172EB2769C10"/>
discharge with faithfulness, the duty imposed on them by their said commission, and proceeded to it immediately.</P>
<P>From their examination, they caused us to see, and we have seen, forty seven hogsheads of to∣bacco, marked J. S. after a new disquisition they declared to us that they were of opinion that the rotten tobacco should be separated; ac∣cordingly we have ordained the said separation should be made by workmen; and the rotten tobacco being weighed produces three thou∣sand one hundred and twenty three pounds, which was estimated by the juries of being of no value.</P>
<P>As for the remnant of the hogsheads, they de∣clared that they could be sold as merchant and good, provided thirty pounds should be deduct∣ed out of every hogshead, on account of the rot∣ten tobacco, which they could not entirely take out; which amounted for the forty seven hogs∣heads, to fourteen hundred and ten pounds weight.</P>
<P>Such is the report of the juries, which they have affirmed, sincere and true, and have de∣clared to insist in it, and have signed. Signed to the minute. I. C. Sauwervald, and Brulard, Sen.</P>
<P>Of all that we have given act, as well as of all protestations and reserves of the Citizen Do∣bree, in behalf and against all whom it may con∣cern, We declare also, that all the hogsheads sold, are marked with the letters J. S. but that several had no counter-marks nor numbers, whether they were rubbed away, or that they had not been marked before their shipping.</P>

JOHN K. HELMUTH.
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE diligent attention and care, in what concerns me, which you have uniformly displayed during your residence with me, and the recent instances which I have observed, of an attachment in your family, which will always endear them to me, have determined me to confide to your care, during the present voyage, my ship Two Friends, and her cargo of Rice and Tobacco, agreeably to invoice and bills of loading inclosed herein—with which you will please to proceed to the port of Nantz or Bour∣deaux in France, and on your arrival there, make the best possible sale of the whole, for my interest—Investing the proceeds in a cargo of Salt, Brandy, Claret, Oil, Soap, Dry Goods, Prunes, &amp;c, as you shall find best for my advan∣tage, taking care to assort it, as nearly as possi∣ble, on the footing of the note at the bottom of this letter, and to have the one cargo put on board, immediately on discharging the other, making the conditions of the sales accordingly —The moment the property is on board your vessel, it is under the in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rance I have here made; whereas, when once on shore, it is out of all security as for me—I have given you ma∣ny letters of introduction, to serve you among my friends in France: You must; select such as∣sistance as you in prudence shall find most ad∣viseable, and I shall allow you five per cent on sales, and five per cent on the returns, out of which, you must pay all charges to those who
<PB N="139" REF="029667_0139_0FE21758D2D9A348"/>
assist you, and conduct the whole business in your own name only, as a citizen of the United States, no foreigner whatever having any con∣cerns in this ship or cargo, as you will see by my qualifications annexed to the ship's clearance.</P>
<P>In making your sales and delivery, attend yourself to the weights, and see that you are not imposed on in that matter; examine also the qualities of Tobacco most suitable for the mar∣ket you go to, to govern ourselves by in future —see also the quality of the goods in return, that they be the best of their kind—If after taking in my goods, you have any room left for passengers or freight, you must do the best pos∣sible, for my interest in taking them in—and ob∣serve to do it, so as not to commit my property, with respect to any of the belligerent powers; as it would be better for me to forego any ad∣vantage of this kind, than to have my proper∣ty endangered by that means—If on your ar∣rival at Nantz or Bourdeaux, you find any other market in Europe better, you may proceed to it under the insurance I have made, paying 1 per cent additional premium, and in case of acci∣dent or damage, take great care to have your papers of surveys, protests, &amp;c. put in proper order, to secure my prompt recovery of the un∣derwriters.</P>
<P>You have taken the names of my different correspondents, so as to know who to value on in case of any unforeseen interruption of your voyage, which I mention by way of precaution, not expecting any thing of this kind will hap∣pen—You know my ship Active is gone to Ham∣burgh—write by post direct on your arrival, to Captn. Blair, to the care of Messrs. Parish and Co. advise him of your proceedings, and tell him
<PB N="140" REF="029667_0140_0FE2175A5F4FDA98"/>
what freights or advantage may offer at the port you are at, for his government, should he see fit to go that way; and in case he stands in need of your assistance give him it, wherever he may claim it—If on your arrival in France, from a∣ny troubles there may be, or any impediment in getting returns, you can't sell your cargo, so as to bring me back the certain proceeds—You must only leave that port, and proceed to Ham∣burgh, or such other market as you may see best for my interest—acting as you would for yourself in such a case—You have a power of Attorney, to act for me in France, and I give you herewith an account of my claims, as to the sale of ship Baring, on Fenwick, Mason and Co. pray attend to it—as also to get my account closed by Gasper Meyer of Bourdeaux, and King, Watson and Co. of Dunkirk, by corres∣ponding accordingly on your arrival, as I shall be glad in that way to get these matters settled —Write me by all conveyances, and observe, that Brandy cannot be shipped but in large casks here, I shall add in another letter what may oc∣cur further, and am mean while truly,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your obedient servant, J. SWANWICK.</SIGNED></CLOSER>

<HEAD>CARGO BACK AS FOLLOWS.</HEAD>
<P>Salt enough to ballast in proportion to what may be necessary—attention paid to the whole of the ship's cargo—Brandy the chief article, of good taste and proof, in large casks—Wines, the best you can get—Claret, as you know I buy them here—not so sure however to sell always as Brandy, therefore but few of these in pro∣portion.</P>
<P>Clarets in bottles and cases, a few prime qua∣lity—
<PB N="141" REF="029667_0141_0FE2175CCD12A630"/>
4 or 500 boxes good fresh Prunes, if you can get them good—An assortment of best fine sallad Oil, in cases.</P>
<P>Of Castile Soap and any other articles of this kind, you may think saleable here.</P>
<P>Some boxes human Hair and perfumer's arti∣cles, hair-powder and pomatum, would proba∣bly answer well—Furniture, such as tables, glasses, chairs, desks, &amp;c. if cheap and fashion∣able, such as you have seen sell well at Odier's.</P>
<P>Any of the articles in the list herein, that may answer, such as millenery, fans, silks, silk hose, gloves, umbrellas, &amp;c.</P>

<SALUTE>HONOR'D SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE ship Two Friends, being at last repaired and ready for sea, I have now the ho∣nor to enclose you herein, invoice and bill of loading, of sundry merchandizes, shipped on your account and risque, amounting to livres, assignats, 404056 3—As also invoice and bill of loading of sundry goods shipped on account of the underwriters, of the cargo of the ship Two Friends, amounting to £250895 18 assignats, with account, sales, and necessary papers for your prompt recovery from them—I further en∣close you a bill on my brother for 1000 dollars, as also a receipt from Capt. Williams, for 900 dollars, which he will deliver you immediately after his arrival.</P>
<P>Your ship's delay here, has been unfortunate∣ly very long, but taking into consideration the
<PB N="142" REF="029667_0142_0FE21761F6EAAB88"/>
many difficulties under which she laboured, it is not too long a time—Mr. S. cannot well form an idea to himself of the way of doing business here, who is so much accustomed to activity. In order to get a single permit for goods it re∣quires 2 or 3 days at least, and the number of holidays which at present are kept in France make mercantile business very difficult to be transacted. On Sundays the people do not any business, and on decade days all public offices are shut.</P>
<P>I am extremely sorry it is impossible for me to return in the ship Two Friends, as there still remains about 60 hogsheads of tobacco un∣sold, and I should not wish to leave France with∣out having the accounts of the voyage com∣pleated: From present appearances tobacco will raise considerably in value, and is in de∣mand here—I dare say should the Two Friends arrive safe in port, the merchandizes which I have shipped will answer very well, as goods of the same kind are 70 or 80 per cent dearer now than they were at the time of the purchase. I hope captain M Call, may have arrived safe at New York, with the goods snipped on your ac∣count. My apprehensions respecting a war with G. Britain are very considerable, notwithstand∣ing (as is reported here) a treaty has been ratified in England, by Mr. Jay—The British cruizers take all American vessels bound to France, load∣ed with provision?. A brig belonging to Mr. Meade, of Philadelphia, and cleared out for Nantz, was boarded by an English frigate in the bay, who put a prize master and several men on board, to carry her into Portsmouth; but the master and American seamen who were left on board of the brig, found means to make drunk

the prize master, and his men; in which time they retook possession of the vessel and brought her safe in here.</P>
<P>The late dauphin of France is dead, and Lux∣embourg is taken by the French. The death of the son of Capet, will occasion some alterati∣on with respect to some of the powers at war with France. The Spanish government de∣manded as one of their terms on which it would agree to a peace, the delivery of the dauphin up to them, some suspicions at this time are formed of his not dying a natural death.</P>
<P>A serious fire took place a few days past at Paimboeuf, by which 6 fine ships were consumed, as you will see by the account given in the Nantz paper.</P>
<P>I wished much for a few lines from you, but I suppose you expected my departure from this before the arrival of the vessels which sailed not long since from Philadelphia. Please accept the enclosed news papers, from</P>

<P>BY this public instrument of protest, be it known and made manifest unto all whom these presents shall come, or may in any ways concern, That, on this eighth day of February, in the year one thousand seven hundred ninety five; before me Peter Frederick Dobree, vice consul of the United States, for the port of Nantz, &amp;c. personnally came and appeared, Sa∣muel Williams, master of the ship Two Friends, of Philadelphia, of about three hundred and fif∣ty tons burden, who being duly sworn, did so∣lemnly declare in manner and form following; that he left Philadelphia the fourth of Decem∣ber, bound to Nantz in France, with a cargo of four hundred and seventy six hogsheads of tobac∣co, one hundred tierces of rice, and twelve thou∣sand staves, on freight, the wind at north, with a fine fresh breeze—that the eighth of the said month, his vessel begun to leak, which obliged him to pump ship every two hours—that the twenty first the wind shifted to south east, and blew very strong, the sea extremely heavy, and the leak encreasing, they were forced to pump every half hour—that this bad weather had last∣ed during fifteen days; that the twenty eighth of January, five o'clock A. M the wind being west north west, and very thick weather, he has seen the land and hoisted his jack, to call a pilot: that none coming, at five o'clock P. M. his vessel struck the rocks, called Les Char∣pentiers, and leaked two feet of water an hour; that he steered at once to get in the river, and got an anchor under sort Maindin, and hoisted lights for assistance; but perceiving that his crew could no longer suffice to pump, and hav∣ing seven to eight feet of water in the hold, he her seen himself sacred (to save the cargo) to

cut his cable and run ashore on the coast of Bre∣vin—that the next day at seven o'clock in the morning, he has sent his boat with Mr. John K. Helmuth, supercargo, to seek succours on shore. That an inhabitant of said Brevin got him eight men, who came on board; that the said day, said Mr. Helmuth, went to Paimboeuf, and wait∣ed on Mr. Boudet, sworn interpreter and broker, with whom he made his declaration at the cus∣tom house, to Mr. Louvet, maritime agent, and to Mr. Lucas, officer of the port, who immedi∣ately gave him every assistance in their power, in getting boats and men; that the thirty first of the same month, at about one o'clock in the morning, he succeeded to get his ship afloat, having still seven to eight feet of water in the hold, although he had constantly kept men at the pump, and that about one in the afternoon he got on the mud between Point Ville Le Martin and Port S. Nazaire, when he got about forty hands at the pump, and seven large boats from from Paimboeuf, which he at once got loaded with rice and tobacco. That having perceived the first of February, the present month, that his ship had done leaking, and the wind coming the next day at the north west, he has sailed for Paimboeuf, and got on the mud there the third instant, at four o'clock in the morning; and from these accidents and the length of his pas∣sage, said Williams, declares that, both his ship and cargo, must be greatly damaged, and there∣fore doth solemnly protest against wind and weather, as he has already done, before the offi∣cers of the customs, at Paimboeuf, and now signs the present protest and instrument, with John Harper, his mate, and Joseph Henry, and An∣drew
