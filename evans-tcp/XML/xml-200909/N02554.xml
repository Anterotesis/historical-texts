<HEAD>To the People of my Charge.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Dearly Beloved in our Lord Jesus Christ,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IT was very pleasing unto me, to observe so ge∣neral a Desire amongst you, that a Monthly-Lecture might be preached in this Town: I was glad when ye said unto me, let us go into the house of the Lord. And your Attendence of such a religious Exercise, hath been hitherto un∣common and exemplary. I hope that you find God∣liness to be profitable for all things, having the pro∣mise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. It is at the Request of many of you, and with an aim at the Good of all your Souls, that these Discourses are made so public. I am very sen∣sible, that they are far below the dignity of the Sub∣jects treated of; and if they shou'd (as most probably they will in this critical Age) be censured as weak and mean, I shall not blame any for being of my Opi∣nion: But I trust that you, to whom these Sermons were acceptable when preached, will read them with Candor, and a suitable concern that ye may be edi∣fied thereby. I send them abroad in a plain Country-Dress, it being such as I could afford them, and which will be most agreable to those on whom I de∣pend to give them Entertainment. You receive them from the Press, in the same words that you had them from the Pulpit. — The seasonableness of these Discourses, cannot (I think) be justly excepted against. The Contempt of the glorious Gospel is doubtless the most provoking Evil of the Times, and is comprehen∣sive of all those Sins, for which the righteous GOD hath a Controversy with our Land: An Essay there∣fore to raise in us due Tho'ts of the Excellency of the Gospel, will not be judged needless. While we are contemplating &amp; adoring the Glory of GOD, which he hath discover'd in his late remarkable &amp; amazing works of Providence, we shou'd not over-look, nor be unaffected with that brighter Display of it, which there is in the Gospel. GOD's saving manifestation of himself, is not to be expected in his providential
<PB REF="003029_0003_0FEFAE966AAE48E8"/>
Dispensations, ordinary or extraordinary, nor in the Terrors of the Law, but in the Glass of his Gospel. The Lord was not in the wind, nor in the earthquake, nor in the fire, but in the still small voice, 1 <HI>Kin.</HI> 19.11, 12.</P>
<P>THE Voice of GOD, which is full of majesty, from the deep places of the Earth, hath awaken'd many to give the more earnest Heed to his sweet &amp; gracious Voice, speaking from Heaven in the Gospel of CHRIST; and by the latter more than the former, is their Con∣version (which we hope is real) effected. There are many excellent Sermons lately publish'd, to teach &amp; ex∣cite us rightly to consider &amp; improve the terrible Works of GOD: and a Discourse concerning the Glory of the Gospel, may also, by the divine Blessing, serve to promote the Reformation, which is so earnestly prayed &amp; la∣bour'd for.—Altho', to our shame &amp; sorrow it must be said, there hath not been that noise &amp; shaking among the dry bones here, which there hath been in other places under the late awful Dispensations, yet some (I hope) have been awakened to flee from wrath: and that they might continue to run well, and not look back, I have put them in remembrance of <HI>Lot's</HI> Wife.</P>
<P>THESE Sermons I dedicate unto you, my beloved People, and wish they might be profitable to your Souls, for which I will very gladly spend, and be spent.</P>
<P>I rejoyce in the Lord, that your Care of me hath flourished, in the provision ye have made for my out∣ward Support, ever since I have been in the work of the Ministry amongst you. And I speak it to your praise, that I have not been necessitated to ask for any mainte∣nance; but what ye have done towards it, ye have done of your own accord, as sensible that a Minister is not to live on the Alms of his People, but that the La∣bourer is worthy of his Hire. —There is one thing I need, and do now ask of you, <HI>to wit,</HI> Your more fer∣vent Prayers unto GOD for me, that he would make me an able and faithful Minister of the New Testa∣ment; and that after I have preached to you in Christ's Name, I may not (as there is great danger that I shall) perish eternally in his wrath. — Brethren pray for me, that the Word of the Lord may have free Course amongst us, and be glorified.</P>

<HEAD>THE <HI>Transcendent Glory</HI> OF THE GOSPEL Displayed.</HEAD>

<P>FOR even that which was made Glorious, had no Glory in this respect, by reason of the Glory that excelleth.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THE Sovereignty and Power of divine Grace were marvellously display'd in the Conversion of <HI>Paul,</HI> who before was a furious Persecutor of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Christ. And the Grace of God which was bestowed on him, was not in vain;</HI> for He <HI>laboured more abundantly than all his Fellow-workers unto the Kingdom.</HI> And GOD highly honoured Him, in propagating &amp; promoting <HI>Christianity</HI> in the World, more by his Ministry than any other Man's. The shining Gifts &amp; extraordinary Success of this great <HI>Apo∣stle,</HI> drew upon him the envious Hatred of <HI>false Teach∣ers;</HI> who maliciously endeavour'd to blast his Repu∣tation, and obstruct his Usefulness. This oblig'd him to speak much in his own vindication: which He did,
<PB N="2" REF="003029_0005_0FEFAE9A682D89A8"/>
not out of Arrogance and Ostentation, but a sincere respect to the Glory of GOD, and the Good of the Church. <HI>Do we begin again</HI> (saith he in the first verse of this Chapter) <HI>to commend our selves? or need we as some others, Epistles of commendation to you, or Letters of commendation from you.</HI> The <HI>Apostle</HI> speaks in the plural Number, because He wrote not only in his own, but also in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Name to the <HI>Corinthians.</HI> He had begun again in the preceding Chapter to commend himself, by declaring his faith∣fulness, as he had done in his <HI>first Epistle</HI> to them. But here he seems to Check himself for it; and tells them, that he needed, not as <HI>others</HI> (meaning <HI>false Apostles</HI> &amp; <HI>Teachers</HI>) commendatory Letters to them or from them: For they themselves, in regard of the Success of his Ministry amongst them, were a <HI>living Epistle,</HI> that might sufficiently recommend him to them, and to all other Churches. <HI>Ye are our Epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men.</HI> As if he had said, You that have been Converted by my preaching, are a commendatory Epistle, which I carry about in my heart, having always a thankful and dear Remembrance of you, and which may satisfy all that have heard of your Faith and Obedience, that I am a true Apostle and faithful Minister of JESUS CHRIST. And he thus strongly proves that they were such an Epistle. <HI>Forasmuch as ye are manifestly de∣clared to be the Epistle of Christ ministred by us, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the living GOD, not in Tables of stone, but in fleshly Tables of the heart.</HI> Their holy Conversation declar'd them to be the Epistle of CHRIST. By them CHRIST sig∣nified his Mind and Will to others, as a Man doth his by a Letter. They were a living Rule, shewing by their Actions how all ought to walk. JESUS CHRIST with his Spirit, that accompanied the Apostle's Mini∣stry, did make saving Impressions on their Hearts; wrote his Law, not on Tables of Stone, but fleshly Tables, the Hearts of Believers. <HI>And such Trust have we through Christ to God-ward.</HI> The Apostle was humbly confident, that GOD had thus blessed
<PB N="3" REF="003029_0006_0FEFAE9C51F88278"/>
his Ministry to them. <HI>Not that we are sufficient of our selves to think any thing as of our selves: but our sufficiency is of God. Paul</HI> acknowledgeth that He was so far from being the Author of the good Work in the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Christians, that He could not of himself so much as <HI>think.</HI> A Man cannot think any thing without the Influence of divine Providence, and he cannot think a good Thought without the Influ∣ence of divine Grace. Every Act is from GOD, as he is the <HI>GOD of Nature,</HI> and the Goodness of any Act is from Him, as He is the <HI>GOD of all Grace.</HI> The Apostle was very careful not to exalt himself, when he was <HI>magnifying his Office. Our sufficiency</HI> (saith he) <HI>is of GOD: who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament.</HI> i. e. The Gospel, called a Testament, because it is a free &amp; firm Dis∣position of the Mediator's good things unto the Heirs of Salvation, to be possessed by them according to his <HI>Will;</HI> and the <HI>New Testament,</HI> in regard of the an∣cient Promises of those good things under the <HI>Law.</HI> The <HI>Apostle</HI> having thus ascribed unto GOD, the Praise of all his Ability for and Success in the <HI>Work of the Ministry,</HI> He proves the Dignity of his Office by drawing a Comparison between the <HI>Law</HI> and the <HI>Gospel,</HI> and shewing how the latter did exceed the former in <HI>Glory.</HI> By several Arguments he de∣monstrates the surpassing Excellency of the Gospel; and in our <HI>Text</HI> declares that the Law, altho' glori∣ous in it self, and the manner of it's delivery, yet compar'd with the Gospel, hath no Glory at all: like as the Glory of the Stars disappears at the rising of the Sun. <HI>For even that which was made glo∣rious, had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excelleth.</HI></P>
<P>THE DOCTRINE from the Words is this, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD><HI>DOCTRINE,</HI> THAT the <HI>Gospel</HI> is incomparably more glo∣rious than the <HI>Law.</HI></HEAD>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003029_0007_0FEFAEA0E8A136F0"/>BY the <HI>Law,</HI> we may understand the <HI>Revelation</HI> which GOD made of himself, his Mind &amp; Will before the coming of CHRIST in the flesh; and by the <HI>Gospel,</HI> the <HI>Revelation</HI> which GOD hath granted since that Time: The <HI>former</HI> is contain'd in the Scriptures usually stiled the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> the <HI>latter</HI> in those of the <HI>New.</HI> By the <HI>Law</HI> is sometimes meant the <HI>De∣calogue</HI> only, or ten Commandments, called the <HI>moral Law;</HI> sometimes the <HI>Ceremonial Institutions, the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances;</HI> sometimes <HI>all the Scriptures of the Old Testament,</HI> the Writings of <HI>Moses</HI> and the Prophets. The <HI>Law,</HI> taken in either of these Senses, hath comparatively <HI>no Glory, in respect of the Glory of the Gospel that excel∣leth.</HI> The Law is in our Context, said to be <HI>glorious,</HI> and the Gospel is stiled the <HI>glorious Gospel,</HI> 2 Cor. 4.4. The Law is in the verse preceding our Text, called <HI>Glory</HI> it self and the Gospel is so termed, 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 2.12. But altho' the <HI>Law</HI> be very excellent and glorious, yet the <HI>Gospel far exceedeth it in Glory.</HI> Compar'd with the Glory of the Gospel, the Law hath none.</P>
<P>WHEREIN, and how far <HI>the Gospel exceeds the Law in Glory,</HI> is now to be consider'd by us.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>THE Gospel is more Glorious than the Law, in regard of the</HI> first Publisher <HI>of it.</HI></P>
<P>THE Law is, in our Text, said to be that, <HI>which was made Glorious:</HI> Besides it's intrinsick Glory, there was some additional Glory made to it, by GOD'S sending of it to his People, by the hand of so <HI>excellent a Person,</HI> as He did: But the Glory which the Gos∣pel hath in respect of the <HI>transcendent Dignity</HI> of the <HI>Lord's Messenger,</HI> who first published it, far exceedeth <HI>that. The Law was given by</HI> Moses, <HI>but Grace and Truth</HI> (i. e. the Gospel, called Grace in opposition to the Severity of the Law, and Truth in opposition to the Types and Shadows of the legal Dispensation) <HI>came by Jesus Christ,</HI> Joh. 1.17. <HI>Moses,</HI> whom GOD employed to deliver the <HI>Law</HI> to his an∣cient People, was a glorious Saint and extraordinary
<PB N="5" REF="003029_0008_0FEFAEA271CB21A0"/>
Prophet: but <HI>the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> by <HI>whom the Gos∣pel at first began to be spoken,</HI> did infinitely excel Him. The <HI>Messiah</HI> was promised of old, as a <HI>Pro∣phet like unto Moses,</HI> Deut. 18.15. He did in many respects signally resemble <HI>Moses:</HI> but this don't im∣ply that <HI>he</HI> was not in all superior to him. CHRIST was not only like to <HI>Moses</HI> in <HI>Moses</HI>'s chiefest Excel∣lencies, but He also infinitely surpassed him. Heb. 3.3. <HI>This Man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses. Moses</HI> was but a <HI>Man, Christ</HI> was GOD as well as <HI>Man: Moses</HI> was not without Sin, but <HI>Christ</HI> was <HI>holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from Sinners: Moses</HI> was only a Servant, <HI>Christ</HI> was also <HI>the Son of GOD.</HI> When <HI>Moses</HI> came down from Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> bringing the <HI>two Tables of Testimony,</HI> his Face shone with a dazling Glory, Exod. 34.30. <HI>When Aaron and all the Children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his Face shone, and they were afraid to come nigh him.</HI> This is mention'd in our Context, <HI>v.</HI> 7. as one thing which made the Law glorious; <HI>The mi∣nistration of Death written and ingraven in stones, was glorious, so that the Children of Israel could not stedfastly behold the Face of Moses, for the Glory of his Countenance.</HI> The Lustre spread on the Face of <HI>Moses,</HI> was an evidence to the Jews, of the <HI>GOD of Glory's</HI> sending him to publish the <HI>Law</HI> unto them. But <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> far excel'd <HI>Moses</HI> in the visible Glory wherewith his Face did shine, when GOD, by a voice from Heaven, declar'd him to be his Son, by whom he would speak, and unto whom Men shou'd hearken. <HI>Moses</HI> in all his Glory, was not arrayed with such Splendor as <HI>Christ</HI> was, at his solemn Investiture into his Office. <HI>When Jesus was baptized, Heaven was opened</HI> to pour down it's Glory on him: <HI>and the holy Ghost descended in a bodily shape, like a Dove upon him,</HI> Luk. 3.21, 22. The holy Ghost is incor∣poreal, but he then assumed a bodily visible Shape, and doubtless one that was very bright and glorious. Some think, that it cannot be concluded from what the Scripture saith concerning the holy Ghost's De∣scent on <HI>Christ,</HI> that he appeared in the form of a Dove:
<PB N="6" REF="003029_0009_0FEFAEA6DC9477A0"/>
But suppose that he assum'd a Body of Light, or Fire, and therein came down, in such like manner as a <HI>Dove,</HI> with it's Wings spread forth, and gathering about our SAVIOUR'S Head cover'd and crown'd it with a visibly Glory. But why may we not, according to the Letter of the Scripture, conceive that the bodily Shape in which the <HI>holy Ghost</HI> descended on <HI>Christ,</HI> was that of a Dove, intimating the Dove-like Dispo∣sition of the <HI>harmless</HI> JESUS? And yet, we have reason to believe that it was in some luminous form, some extraordinary appearance of Light, that the holy Ghost came down on our Saviour. <HI>Justin Martyr</HI> speaking of <HI>Christ</HI>'s Baptism saith, that there was a Fire lighted in the River <HI>Jordan.</HI> "By which it appears, that it was an early Tradition in the Church, that the Water, immediately after <HI>Christ</HI> was baptized in it, seem'd to be all on Fire by the Reflection of that bright and flaming appearance, in which the holy Ghost descended upon him". And at his Trans∣figuration on Mount <HI>Tabor, His Face did shine as the Sun, and his Raiment was white as the Light,</HI> Mat. 27.2. His Face did shine as the Sun in it's meridian Brightness, and his Raiment was like the whitness of a flash of Lightning. The three Disciples that were with <HI>Christ</HI> on the Mount, were afraid and astonished at the sight, as <HI>Aaron</HI> and the Israelites were at the sight of the Glory on <HI>Moses's</HI> Face. The <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> which <HI>Christ received from GOD the Father,</HI> at his Baptism and Transfiguration, was too great to be communicated to any but the <HI>Son of GOD;</HI> It was therefore the Sign, by which <HI>John</HI> the Baptist knew him to be the true <HI>Messiah;</HI> and upon which he groun∣ded his Testimony concerning him, Joh. 1.33, 34. <HI>I know him not: but he that sent me to baptize with water; the same said unto me, upon whom thou shalt see he Spirit descending and remaining on him, the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which baptizeth with the holy Ghost. And I sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> record that this is the Son of God.</HI> The visible Splendor with which <HI>Christ</HI> was invested at his Baptism and Transfiguration, was so great, that all who beheld it might rationally conclude that he was
<PB N="7" REF="003029_0010_0FEFAEA96269D080"/>
the <HI>Son of GOD:</HI> Such Glory wou'd not be imparted to any other. <HI>John</HI> the Evangelist, who was an Eye∣witness of the Glory shed on <HI>Christ</HI> at his Transfigu∣ration, and probably of that at his Baptism also, doth partly with reference thereunto say, Joh. 1.14. <HI>We beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father.</HI> The Glory was such as became him, who was the only begotten Son of GOD: It was questionless therefore a Glory far surpassing that on the Face of <HI>Moses,</HI> when he brought down the Law from <HI>Sinai. Jesus Christ</HI> must be infinitely more glorious than <HI>Moses,</HI> being the <HI>Brightness of God's glory, and the express Image of his Person,</HI> Heb. 1.3. <HI>In him dwelt all the fulness of the</HI> infinite <HI>Godhead bodily,</HI> and from him did it shine forth <HI>in the Days of his Flesh,</HI> he being the Effulgence of his <HI>Father's Glory. Moses</HI> was not <HI>more than a Prophet, John</HI> the Bap∣tist was, and among them that are born of Women, there arose not a greater than <HI>John;</HI> yet he counted himself not worthy to do the meannest Office for CHRIST, to be the least and lowest of his Attendants, Luke 3.16. —<HI>One mightier than I cometh, the latchet of whose Shoes I am not worthy to unloose.</HI></P>
<P>THUS, in respect of the Glory which the Law and Gospel receive from the shining Excellencies of the first Publishers thereof, the latter doth abundantly exceed the former in Glory.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>THE Gospel is more glorious than the Law in regard of the</HI> Circumstances <HI>which attended the Promulgation of it.</HI></P>
<P>THE Law was made glorious by the manner of it's delivery. When the LORD came down on Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> holy Angels were the Chariots of his Glory, He rode upon Cherubims, and there was an illustri∣ous Appearance of Myriads of them, Psal. 68.17. <HI>The Chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thou∣sands of Angels: the Lord is among them as in Sinai, in the holy place.</HI> The Mount was altogether on a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in Fire: and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a Fur∣nace,
<PB N="8" REF="003029_0011_0FEFAEAAF5F80270"/>
and the whole Mount quaked greatly: <HI>Sinai</HI> was moved at the Presence of the GOD of Israel. There was the sound of a Trumpet, long and loud; the noise of Thunders, and the voice of Words, very ter∣rifying. The glorious manner in which GOD gave the Law on <HI>Sinai,</HI> is elegantly set forth by the Pro∣phet, Hab. 3.3, 4. <HI>GOD came from Teman, and the holy One from Mount Paran, Selah. His Glory covered the Heavens, and the Earth was full of his Praise,</HI> or Splendor. <HI>And his brightness was as the light, he had horns,</HI> or bright Beams, <HI>coming out of his hand:</HI> "Rays of Glory were darted forth around Him" With such Tokens of Majesty was the Pro∣mulgation of the Law attended. But, altho' there was less Terror, yet there was not less Glory in the Circumstances which accompanied the first Publication of the Gospel. It was usher'd in, by Angel's decla∣ring and celebrating the Birth of JESUS, that Horn of Salvation which GOD promis'd to raise up unto his People, in the House of his Servant <HI>David.</HI> The poor <HI>Shepherds</HI> at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> saw as great <HI>Glory</HI> there, and as bright an Apparition of Angels, as the Israelites did at <HI>Sinai,</HI> and heard more glorious Words, Luke 2.9, 10, 11. <HI>Lo, the Angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them; and they were sore afraid. And the Angel said unto them, fear not, for behold, I bring you good tydings of great Joy, which shall be to all people, for unto you is born this day in the city of David, a Saviour; which is Christ the Lord.</HI> ver. 13, 14. <HI>And suddenly there was with the Angel, a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God, and saying, Glory to God in the highest, and on Earth peace, good will towards Men.</HI> — A glorious Lamp was lighted in the aetherial Heaven, an extraordinary Star appeared, to give notice to the World of the Ap∣proach of the <HI>Sun of Righteousness,</HI> Matth. 2.1, 2. <HI>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king: behold, there came wise men from the East to Jerusalem, saying, where is He that is born king of the Jews? for we have seen his Star in the East, and are come to worship
<PB N="9" REF="003029_0012_0FEFAEADAA74C640"/>
him.</HI> — Was there not more Glory deriv'd on the Gospel, from what was done and said at <HI>Christ</HI>'s Baptism and Transfiguration, than there was on the Law, from all that Majesty and awful Pomp that Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> was cover'd with? What a glorious Scene was it, for Heaven to open, and the holy Ghost visibly to descend on <HI>Christ</HI> to array Him with a daz∣ling Splendor, and such a voice to come from the <HI>excellent Glory, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased, hear ye Him?</HI> Was there any Brightness at <HI>Sinai,</HI> comparable to that on Mount <HI>Tabor?</HI> or any Voice so glorious? — And in order to the more full and extensive Publication of the Gos∣pel, by the Apostles of <HI>Christ,</HI> the Descent of the holy Ghost upon them, at the Feast of Pentecost (the same time of the Year, that the Law was given at <HI>Sinai)</HI> was a thing which equal'd, if not exceeded in glory, any Circumstance which attended the Pro∣mulgation of the Law. There was indeed no Trum∣pet, nor terrifying Voice, no Thunder, Darkness nor Tempest, but <HI>a sound from Heaven, as of a rushing mighty Wind, and it filled all the House where the Apostles were sitting;</HI> and there was the Appearance of bright flames of Fire, cleaving asunder; and in the form of Tongues resting on the Heads of the Disci∣ples, and they spake all Languages to the astonish∣ment of multitudes who were then present, <HI>Act.</HI> 2. So that the publication of the Gospel was graced with as remarkable and glorious Circumstances, as that of the Law. It might also, under this Head, be shown, How the Miracles which attended the publication of the Gospel, thro' <HI>Christ</HI>'s and his Apostle's time on Earth, did, both in number and greatness, far exceed those which accompanied the Promulgation of the Law. <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets</HI> did not, all of them do, so many, nor such mighty Works, as <HI>JESUS of Nazareth</HI> did. How <HI>great</HI> must that <HI>Salvation</HI> be, how glorious that Gospel, <HI>which at first began to be spoken,</HI> and was thus proved by the Lord, <HI>and was</HI> afterwards <HI>confirmed</HI> likewise <HI>by them that heard him; GOD bearing them witness, both with Signs and Wonders,
<PB N="10" REF="003029_0013_0FEFAEB0E7E64778"/>
and with diverse Miracles, and gifts of the holy Ghost, according to his will?</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>THE Gospel is more glorious than the Law, in respect of its revealing the Glory of GOD so much more clearly and fully, than the Law doth.</HI></P>
<P>THE Gospel exceeds the Law, not only in an acci∣dental or adventitious, but also an intrinsick Glory. The Law was not only made glorious in the Eyes of the Children of Israel, by the dignity of the Person and lustre on the face of Moses, by whom it came, and the manner of its delivery, but it was glorious in it self; being a <HI>Revelation</HI> from GOD of his Ex∣cellencies to his Creatures, and his Will concerning them: But the Gospel is more glorious in it self, being a clearer, and more compleat <HI>Revelation</HI> of GOD'S Glory. This is hinted by the Apostle in our Context, where he is shewing how the Gospel exceeds the Law in Glory, v. 18. <HI>But we all with open face, beholding as in a Glass the Glory of the Lord. Moses</HI> put a Vail over his Face, when he came down from the Mount, that so all the Glory of his Countenance might not be seen, might not this represent GOD'S concealing from the Jewish People much of his Glory, which was afterwards to be manifested? v. 13. <HI>Moses put a Vail over his face, that the Children of Israel could not stedfastly look to the end of that which is abolished.</HI> They had but an obscure View of the Mystery of CHRIST, which was vailed under the Types and Shadows of the Ceremonial Law; like as the Glory on the face of Moses was vailed. v. 14 <HI>But their Minds were blinded: for until this day re∣maineth the same vail untaken away, in the reading of the Old Testament: which vail is done away in Christ.</HI> The vail of outward Shadows and Types was removed, by <HI>Christ's</HI> coming into the World: for then the Prefigurations, Prophesies and Promises of the <HI>Messiah</HI> were fulfilled, and the Glory of GOD in our Redemption by <HI>Christ</HI> was to be clearly seen: But the vail of spiritual Blindness on the Minds and Hearts of the Jews, which was also mystically
<PB N="11" REF="003029_0014_0FEFAEB45FB22E78"/>
signified by the Vail upon the face of <HI>Moses,</HI> remains to this day in their reading the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> which hinders them from discovering the <HI>Messiah</HI> to be already come, and that the Types and Prophesies are accomplished in him. <HI>But we all with open face,</HI> all we who believe have the Vail removed from us, so that <HI>with open face</HI> we <HI>behold the Glory of the Lord as in a Glass, i. e.</HI> in the Gospel, which is as a Glass, not a Perspective thro' which things afar off are darkly seen, but a Looking-glass fully representing the face as near. <HI>The Glory of the Lord,</HI> which was vail'd and cover'd under the Types and Shadows of the <HI>Law,</HI> is now by the <HI>Gospel</HI> clearly revealed. And how Chris∣tians do in the Gospel, as it is a Glass, see the <HI>Glory of GOD,</HI> the Apostle telleth us, 2 Cor. 4.6. <HI>For GOD who Commanded the light to shine out of dark∣ness, hath shined in our <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of GOD, in face of Jesus Christ.</HI> By the face of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> in which the Glory of GOD is seen, the Apostle seems to allude to that divine Lustre with which the Face of <HI>Moses</HI> shone, when he came down from Mount <HI>Sinai:</HI> So that his meaning may be this, That as the Children of Israel with their bodily Eyes saw something of GOD'S Glory shining in the Face of <HI>Moses;</HI> so they the Disciples of our Saviour, did more clearly with the Eyes of their enlightned Understandings behold the divine Glory in <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> whose Face the Glass of the Gospel represented to them. <HI>Christ</HI> is the <HI>brightness of God's Glory, and the express Image of his Person.</HI> There is no Perfection in GOD, which is not in <HI>Christ,</HI> for <HI>Christ</HI> is GOD. And in that Glass wherein we see the Face of <HI>Christ</HI> who is thus the Image of GOD, we behold the Glory of GOD; and in the Gospel of Jesus Christ is more clearly revealed. By the Law Men might discern, as it were GOD'S <HI>Back-parts.</HI> As He said unto <HI>Moses,</HI> who beseeched the LORD to shew him his Glory, Exod. 33.23. <HI>Thou shalt see my back-parts: but my Face shall not be seen:</HI> But in the Gospel we may see the <HI>Face of Jesus Christ,</HI> and so the <HI>Face of</HI> GOD;
<PB N="12" REF="003029_0015_0FEFAEB71B958218"/>
for CHRIST is the adequate and essential <HI>Image</HI> of GOD. The knowledge of <HI>Christ,</HI> and so of GOD'S Glory, which could be obtain'd by the Writings of <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets,</HI> was small, compar'd with that which the <HI>Gospel</HI> affords; and did not the <HI>New Testament</HI> expound the <HI>Old,</HI> wou'd not the <HI>Vail on the face of Moses,</HI> as to us, <HI>remain untaken away.</HI></P>
<P>Particularly,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Glory of divine</HI> Mercy <HI>shining in the Face of Jesus Christ, it clearly displayed by the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>GOD'S Goodness is his Glory; and this is most clearly and fully revealed in the <HI>Gospel;</HI> the sum of which is, <HI>that God is in Christ, reconciling the World unto himself, not imputing their Trespasses unto them.</HI> The <HI>moral Law</HI> discovers nothing of GOD'S Mercy toward sinful Creatures: and the <HI>ceremonial Law</HI> had only a <HI>shadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the things:</HI> It contain'd a dark and imperfect, not a lively and full Representation of those <HI>good things,</HI> which the <HI>Mercy</HI> of GOD designed for miserable Sinners. The Mystery of <HI>Christ,</HI> which the Gospel reveals, was under the legal Dispensa∣tion wrapped up in Types, Ceremonies, and obscure Prophesies and Promises. The Gospel, the <HI>Preaching of Jesus Christ is the revelation of the mystery, which was kept secret since the world began,</HI> Rom. 16.25. The Riches of Grace, the unsearchable Riches of <HI>Christ</HI> were, in a great measure hid, before the Gospel open'd them; so that as the Prophet, and after him, the Apostle said concerning the same, <HI>Eye had not seen, nor Ear heard, neither had entred into the Heart of Man, the things which God hath prepared for them that Love him.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Glory of divine</HI> Wisdom, <HI>shining in the face of Jesus Christ is eminently displayed in the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Bowels of GOD'S Mercy were troubled for us, the Mouth of his Justice was opened against us miserable Sinners. Justice demanded the ever∣lasting
<PB N="13" REF="003029_0016_0FEFAEBA66C212C8"/>
Destruction of Guilty, and therefore defer∣vedly accursed Creatures; and back'd it's Demand with powerful Arguments, taken from the Holiness of GOD, and his Veracity in his Threatnings: And <HI>Mercy</HI>'s Pleas for the Salvation of the miserable Chil∣dren of Men, were so importunate, that GOD would not reject them. Therefore he employ'd his infinite <HI>Wisdom</HI> in the Counsel of Peace between the Father and the Son, to contrive a Method of Redemption, in which these Attributes shou'd harmonize, Justice and Mercy kiss each other, and be glorified together. And this adorable <HI>Wisdom</HI> the Gospel reveals; <HI>Wisdom,</HI> which was before <HI>hidden,</HI> 1 Cor. 2.7. Wis∣dom, which the blessed Angels discover'd nothing of by their immediate Views of the divine Glory in Heaven; They always <HI>behold the Face of GOD,</HI> yet they saw not this Wisdom till the Gospel exhibited the Face of <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI> Eph. 3.10. <HI>To the intent that now unto the Principalities &amp; Powers in heavenly places, might be known by the church the manifold Wisdom of God.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the Glory of GOD, especially the Glory of his <HI>Mercy</HI> &amp; <HI>Wisdom</HI> is most clearly discover'd in the Gospel, Joh. 1.18. <HI>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father; he hath declared him.</HI> The Bosom is the Seat of Love, and Repository of Secrets: <HI>Jesus Christ who is in the bosom of God the Father,</HI> hath by the Gospel made known his tender Compassions and my∣sterious Counsels. The Gospel being such a <HI>Reve∣lation,</HI> the Glory of it far surpasseth that of the Law</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>THE Gospel exceeds the Law in glory, in∣asmuch as it is a</HI> general Revelation, <HI>designed for the use and benefit of mankind.</HI></P>
<P>AS it is a clearer and more compleat <HI>Revelation</HI> of GOD, his Mind and Will, so it is intended and granted for the Instruction and Advantage of more than the <HI>Law</HI> was. The Law was a Revelation directed to the <HI>Jews</HI> peculiarly, and not vouchsafed to other
<PB N="14" REF="003029_0017_0FEFAEBF13B98F80"/>
Nations, Psal. 147.19, 20. <HI>He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his Judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any Nation: and as for his Judgments, they have not known them.</HI> The Legal Despensation was restrained to that People, whom the LORD Chose to be a special People unto himself, above all that were upon the face of the Earth. <HI>To the Israelites pertained the Adoption, and the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the service of GOD, and the 'Promises,</HI> Rom. 9.4. The Law <HI>of Commandments contained in Ordi∣nances</HI> was a <HI>Wall of Partition,</HI> that fenced the Jewish Nation, and sever'd, them from others, making them GOD'S Sacred Inclosure, into which the Gentiles should not come, to partake of the Privileges of the <HI>Church.</HI> The Ceremonial Law is stiled the <HI>Enmity,</HI> being the cause and sign of Enmity between <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> keeping them at a distance from one another. Thus the <HI>Law</HI> was confined within nar∣row Bounds; was directed and restrained to the Use of one Nation, and that the <HI>fewest of all People.</HI> But the <HI>Gospel</HI> is a Dispensation, in it's Nature, and in it's Author's Design, general: or such as respects Mankind, without any distinction of Nation. There is no Monopoly of it's Privileges. It is proportion'd to the need, and ordain'd for the benefit of Men of all Nations and Conditions. The Gospel is (as the angelical Preacher said) <HI>Good tydings of great Joy, which shall be to all people,</HI> Luke 2.10. <HI>The Grace of God,</HI> i.e. The Gospel <HI>that bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all Men,</HI> Tit. 2.11. Christ <HI>hath broken down the middle wall of partition between</HI> Jews and Gentiles; <HI>Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances: and came and preached Peace,</HI> i. e. The Gospel of Peace, <HI>to them which were afar off, and to them that were nigh.</HI> The Gentiles <HI>therefore are no more Strangers and Foreigners, but fellow Citizens with the Saints and of the houshold of God,</HI> Eph. 2. Now a general Revelation intended and granted for the benefit of all, is more glorious than that which was particular, or restrained to one People.
<PB N="15" REF="003029_0018_0FEFAEC19F91ECA8"/>
That Glory excelleth, which is not only in it self brighter, but also in it's extent spread further, than another Glory; and such is the Glory of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> compar'd with that of the <HI>Law.</HI> The <HI>Law</HI> was as a <HI>Lamp</HI> which illuminates one Room: The <HI>Gospel</HI> is as the <HI>Sun, whose going forth is from one end of the Heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it,</HI> diffu∣sing a universal Light. And surely the glory of the <HI>Sun,</HI> in this respect, far surpasseth that of a burning Lamp, and as much doth the Glory of the Gospel that of the Law.</P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>THE Gospel is more glorious than the Law, because it is the</HI> ministration of the Spirit.</P>
<P>THE Gospel is in opposition to the Law, called the <HI>Spirit,</HI> and the <HI>ministration of the Spirit,</HI> Con∣text, <HI>ver.</HI> 6.8. Because the Spirit of GOD accompanies the Dispensation of it, much more than it did that of the Law. By means of the Gospel Persons receive the <HI>holy Spirit;</HI> Gal. 3.2. <HI>This only would I learn of you, received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the hearing of Faith?</HI> By the <HI>works of the Law,</HI> we are here to understand the doctrine of Justification by the Works of the Law, which the <HI>Judazing Teachers</HI> preached: and by the <HI>hearing</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> is meant the Doctrine of the Gospel; hearing being put for the thing heard, and Faith for the Doctrine believed: By the hearing of Faith, and not by the Works of the Law is the Spirit received. It is true, that under the Law GOD bestowed his Spirit on his Servants, Neh. 9.20. <HI>Thou gavest also thy good Spi∣rit, to instruct them.</HI> But the holy Spirit is more plentifully granted under the <HI>Evangelical,</HI> than it was under the <HI>Legal</HI> Dispensation. The gift of the Spirit, in the largest measures of it, was reserv'd for the Glory of Gospel-times. GOD often promised, that in the Day of Gospel-light he wou'd <HI>pour out his Spirit:</HI> This Phrase imports his bestowing of it plen∣tifully. It is with an eye to Gospel-times, that GOD'S giving his <HI>Spirit</HI> is express'd by his <HI>pouring of it forth.</HI> The Spirit was more sparingly given under the <HI>Law,</HI> than it is under the <HI>Gospel;</HI> It then came
<PB N="16" REF="003029_0019_0FEFAEC5985F8080"/>
down from Heaven, at it were, in a few drops, but now, as it were, in a full Stream. Under the Gos∣pel, that Promise, <HI>I will pour out my Spirit on all Flesh,</HI> is fulfill'd, Acts 2.16, 17. "There were some sprinklings of it under the law, and confin'd to a se∣parate Nation, but now showers are poured down upon all Nations, to make them fruitful in good Works". On this account the Gospel is far more glorious than the Law, as the Apostle argueth in our Context, Ver. 7, 8. <HI>If the ministration of death</HI> (i. e. the Law) <HI>written and ingraven in stones was glori∣ous — How shall not the ministration of the Spirit be rather glorious?</HI></P>
<P N="6">VI. <HI>THE Gospel is far more glorious than the Law, in regard of the</HI> wonderful Effects <HI>produced by it.</HI></P>
<P>THE glorious Things which have been, and still are effected by the <HI>Gospel,</HI> accompanied with the <HI>Spirit of</HI> GOD, declare it's surpassing Glory.— I might here Instance in those great and marvellous things which were done by it in the World at the first Preach∣ing thereof, and in those also which it still per∣formeth in the Souls of Men; equal to which, in number, or Glory, were never accomplished by the Law.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Effects produced by the Gospel in the World, at the</HI> first <HI>Preaching of it, were admirable and glorious.</HI></P>
<P>THE Blow that was given to <HI>Satan</HI>'s visible King∣dom on Earth, by no other Weapon than the Gos∣pel, sheweth the Excellency of it; and may well make us to say concerning it, as <HI>David</HI> of the <HI>Sword</HI> with which he slew <HI>Goliah, There is none like it.</HI> The <HI>Rulers of the darkness of this World</HI> never had a more extensive Dominion, nor exercis'd a more Ty∣ranical Power over the miserable Children of Men, than about the time that the Gospel began to be preached. The <HI>Devil</HI> was then seated and strength∣ned in the Government of the Nations; was wor∣shipped as a God: He almost every where had his
<PB N="17" REF="003029_0020_0FEFAEC8AD985530"/>
Temples, Altars and Oracles, that were much fre∣quented and consulted. The People brought their Offerings unto him; he did <HI>eat the fat of Sacrifices, and drink the blood of drink-Offerings;</HI> yea the Blood of his cruel Votaries Sons &amp; Daughters, whom they bar∣barously sacrificed unto him. Idolatry &amp; Superstition every where prevailed. But by the Preaching of the Gospel, the <HI>Devil's</HI> Kingdom was shaken, and he lost that great Power which he before had in the World. Luke 10.17, 18. <HI>The seventy returned again with joy, saying, Lord, even the Devils are subject unto us, thro' thy name. And he said unto them, I be∣held Satan as Lightning fall from Heaven.</HI> Our Saviour in this Expression, might allude unto Satan's first Fall from Heaven; when of an Angel of Light he became a Spirit of Darkness, and was in a mo∣ment cast down from his glorious Seat in Heaven: So by the Preaching of the Gospel he shou'd be turn∣ed out of the Throne which he had usurped on Earth, and fall from his great Power in the World, as Light∣ning flasheth &amp; vanisheth away suddenly &amp; irrecovera∣bly. When the Gospel was first published by <HI>Christ,</HI> and Those sent by him immediately to preach it, the King∣dom of darkness was soon weakned, and did appa∣rently go to wreck. The <HI>Devil</HI> was beaten out of his Territories, his Temples were demolished, his Altars thrown down, and his Oracles silenced. With that <HI>Rod of his Strength</HI> which <HI>Christ</HI> sent out of <HI>Zion,</HI> he destroyed the <HI>Works of the Devil,</HI> 2 Cor. 10.4. <HI>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty thro' God, to the pulling down of strong Holds.</HI> The <HI>Apostles</HI> Warfare against <HI>Principalities</HI> and <HI>Powers</HI> was spiritual, the Weapons they used were not carnal, yet mighty thro' GOD: They atchie∣ved glorious Conquests, but not by the edge of the Sword, or stratagems of War: The Gospel was, thro' GOD the mighty and effectual Weapon, with which they batter'd the Devil's Fortresses, and over-turn'd his Dominion. The Gospel prevail'd against the Learning of Philosophers, and Power of Earthly Kings, and gloriously triumph'd over all the Opposition
<PB N="18" REF="003029_0021_0FEFAECB29E34FF8"/>
which it met with from the Gates of Hell. <HI>Dagon</HI> fell before the <HI>Ark</HI> of GOD; and the <HI>Magicians</HI> Ser∣pents were devoured by <HI>Aaron's</HI> Rod; so the Gospel was too hard for all the Strength and Wisdom of the World. The Walls of <HI>Jericho</HI> fell down at the Priests blowing of the <HI>Rams Horns;</HI> so when the Trumpet of the Gospel was sounded by the Ministers thereof, down went the Images, Idolatries and Superstitions of the Gentiles, and the Religion of <HI>Christ</HI> took place, and his Kingdom was set up on the Ruin of Satan's. In a few Years the Gospel <HI>(like Leaven which soon leaveneth the whole Lump)</HI> spread into almost all parts of the known World. Col. 1.6. <HI>The Gospel is come unto you, as it is in all the World.</HI> The great Change wrought in the World, by means of the Gospel, at the first Preaching of it, speaks it glorious.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Effects which the Gospel still produceth in the Souls of Men are great ana glorious.</HI></P>
<P>IN regard of those things especially, which the Gospel, accompanied with the holy Spirit, effecteth in the Souls of Believers, the Apostle doth in our Text and Context so magnify it above the Law.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE Gospel worketh effectually to the Con∣version of Souls.</HI></P>
<P>NOT only was <HI>Satan's</HI> visible Kingdom in the World marvellously destroy'd by the Gospel, at the first Preaching of it, but also his invisible Empire in the Hearts of Sinners is continually broken by this <HI>Rod of Christ's strength, which he hath sent out of Zion.</HI> This dasheth in pieces the <HI>Works of the De∣vil</HI> within Men, as powerfully as it did those with∣out them. The <HI>strong Holds</HI> which he hath erected in the Souls of Men, blindness of Mind, hardness of Heart, stubbornness of Will, and the like, are demo∣lished by the Gospel, as gloriously as were the false Religions, Idolatries and Superstitions, which he had set up in the World. Luke 11.21, 22. <HI>When a strong man armed keepeth his palace, his goods are in peace. But when a stronger than he shall come upon him, and
<PB N="19" REF="003029_0022_0FEFAECEB39F2DF0"/>
overcome him, he taketh from him all his armour wherein he trusted, and divideth his spoil. Satan</HI> is the strong Man armed, the Heart of every uncon∣verted Sinner is his Garrison which he keeps shut up, and barred again CHRIST, by unreasonable Pre∣judices, carnal Inclinations and worldly Interests; but the <HI>King of Glory,</HI> by his Spirit in the Gospel, comes upon, and casts out the strong Man armed, storms and takes his Fort, and converteth it into a <HI>holy Temple.</HI> Upon the <HI>white Horse</HI> of the pure Word of Truth, the mighty Redeemer still <HI>rideth forth conquering, and to conquer,</HI> Rev. 6.2. By means of the Gospel Persons are <HI>turned from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</HI> The Gos∣pel, and not the Law, is the Instrumental Cause of saving Conversion, Cont. ver. 8. <HI>The Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.</HI> The moral Law revealing Man's Duty, and denouncing GOD'S Wrath against Him for not performing it, <HI>killeth:</HI> It makes Sin to revive in the Conscience, and the guilty to dye. It only sheweth Sinners that they are <HI>dead Men,</HI> being condemned already; and discovers to them no possible way of escaping the Curse, and offers no Grace, no supernatural Strength unto them to enable them to get out of the State of Nature. <HI>But the Spirit giveth Life:</HI> The Gospel which is called the <HI>Spirit quickeneth</HI> those who are <HI>dead in Trespasses and Sins.</HI> Spiritual Life is infused by means of the Gospel: The holy Ghost useth it as his Instrument in quick∣ning of dead Souls, Converting of sinful Men, Joh. 5.25. <HI>Verily, verily I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.</HI> CHRIST'S voice in the Gospel raiseth the spiritually dead. The beginning and progress of Conversion is by means of the Gospel; the whole conformity of the Soul unto <HI>Christ</HI> is wrought thereby; as the Apostle sheweth in our Context, Ver. 18. <HI>We all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same Image; from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.</HI> The fight of the
<PB N="20" REF="003029_0023_0FEFAED039B46E30"/>
LORD'S Glory in the Glass of the Gospel, is trans∣forming; Changeth the Soul into the Image and like∣ness of CHRIST. The Spirit of GOD worketh a sa∣ving Change in the Heart of a Sinner, by giving him a clear view of CHRIST'S Glory, as the Gospel repre∣sents it. And the holy Ghost carries on the work of Sanctification in Believers, by enabling them to see more and more of the LORD'S Glory in that Glass: They are changed into his Image, <HI>from Glory to Glory;</HI> that is, from one degree of Grace to another, until they arrive to the perfection of Holiness. All the De∣grees of our conformity to CHRIST are stiled Glory; the first and lowest degree of Grace is Glory begun, and the highest is Glory perfected. Believers see the Glory of the Lord in the Gospel, and are changed into the same Image, <HI>from Glory to Glory;</HI> that is, (as one conceiveth from the allusion to a Glass) "The Glory of the Lord shining upon the Gospel, and from the Gospel shining upon our Hearts, doth Change them into the Image of the same Glory; even as the Glory of the Sun shining upon a Glass, and from that Glass reflecting on a Wall, doth therein produce an Image of it's own light." Thus it is by the Gospel that a saving Change is wrought in the Soul. This Glory is peculiar to the Gos∣pel. It is said indeed, that <HI>the Law of the Lord is perfect, converting the Soul,</HI> Psal. 19.7. But by the <HI>Law</HI> here, as in many other Texts of Scrip∣ture, is meant the whole Word of GOD, compre∣hending the Promises of Salvation by <HI>Christ.</HI> The <HI>mo∣ral Law</HI> is not the Instrumental Cause of Conversion. It prepares a Soul for Conversion, inasmuch as by it is the <HI>knowledge of Sin:</HI> It convinceth the Sinner of Guilt, and deserved Damnation, but leaves him shut up under the fearful Curse, without the least hope of escape. Did not the Gospel reveal that <HI>God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself,</HI> the awa∣ken'd Sinner wou'd pine away in his Iniquities. It is not the Terror of the LORD, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Law, but his Glory shining in the Gospel, that pro∣duceth a saving Change in the Heart.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="21" REF="003029_0024_0FEFAED2AC234D18"/>2. PEACE of Conscience <HI>is an excellent Effect of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>BY Peace of Conscience, I mean that rest and com∣fort which the believing Soul enjoyeth in the expecta∣tion and perswasion of GOD'S Mercy thro' CHRIST, to pardon and save it. This is the product of the Gos∣pel of Peace. The Law is in our Context stiled the <HI>ministration of Condemnation,</HI> because it passeth the Sentence of Death upon the Transgressor of it, and gives Conscience it's Authority to condemn the Sinner: But the <HI>Gospel</HI> is called the <HI>ministration of Righteous∣ness,</HI> because it exhibits and offers a Righteousness suf∣ficient for our Justification: <HI>Therein is the Righte∣ousness of God revealed from faith to faith,</HI> Rom. 1.17. The Gospel revealing that perfect Righteousness, which GOD graciously imputeth without the Works of the Law, to those who believe in <HI>Christ,</HI> is the means of setling an happy Peace in the Conscience. Now, as the Apostle saith in the verse immediately preceding our Text, <HI>If the ministration of Condemna∣tion be glory, much more doth the ministration of Righteousness exceed in Glory.</HI> The Gospel far excels the Law in that it is the ministration of Righteousness, and so of Peace. It is true, there is some mention made of this Righteousness in the Writings of <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets;</HI> hence it is said, Rom. 3.21, 22. <HI>Now the Righteousness of God without the Law is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Pro∣phets; even the Righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ, unto all, and upon all them that believe.</HI> But by the <HI>Law</HI> here the Apostle doth not intend the <HI>moral Law,</HI> for that is wholly silent con∣cerning an imputed Righteousness: But he means the Law of Commandments contained in Ordinances, the <HI>ceremonial Law;</HI> and it is certain, that the Sacrifices under the Law did typify the Death of CHRIST, by which we have now received the Atonement; and there were also many Prophesies and Promises of <HI>Christ,</HI> as the <HI>Lord our Righteousness;</HI> and yet the glorious Mystery of Justification by Faith in <HI>Christ,</HI> was in a great measure kept secret until the Gospel mani∣fested
<PB N="22" REF="003029_0025_0FEFAED4701A7FB8"/>
it. <HI>In the Tabernacle were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience,</HI> Heb. 9.9. They indeed prefigur'd a Sacrifice sufficient to pacify Wrath, and quiet Conscience, yet those Sacri∣fices, and also the Promises and Prophesies which the <HI>Old Testament</HI> Church enjoyed, were but an obscure exhibition of that Righteousness which is the founda∣tion of Pardon and Peace, Heb. 10.1. <HI>For the Law having a shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with those sacri∣fices, which they offered year by year continually, make the comers thereunto perfect.</HI> "The Jewish Ordinances were rather a Bond acknowledging the Debt, than an Acquittance shewing the Discharge; therefore called, <HI>The Hand-writing of Ordinances against us.</HI>" But the Gospel clearly revealing the Righteousness of CHRIST for our Justification, ma∣keth those who receive it <HI>perfect as pertaining to the Conscience.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>A</HI> glorious Liberty <HI>is another Effect of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>THE glorious Liberty of the Children of GOD is spoken of, <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.21. It is by the Gospel that Men are made Partakers of it. <HI>Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Liberty,</HI> Cont. v. 17. By the <HI>Liberty</HI> of the Children of GOD, we may understand such an ingenuous Disposition as that Men do look upon, and act towards GOD as a gracious Father, in and thro' JESUS CHRIST. The <HI>Law,</HI> the <HI>Covenant from Mount Sinai gendreth to Bondage,</HI> Gal. 4.24. Those who are under it, are in the Condition of Slaves, not of Sons. It produceth such a Temper and Spirit towards GOD, as Slaves usually have toward their Masters; being influenced to their Duty only by Fear, or an apprehension of the Severity of their Masters, and the smart of the Rod. But the Gospel produceth a Child-like Temper in the Souls of Be∣lievers. By it they receive, not the <HI>Spirit of bon∣dage again to fear, but the spirit of adoption, where∣by they cry, Abba, Father,</HI> Rom. 8.15.

at all times, as Children to a Father: They may come to the <HI>Throne of Grace,</HI> in every <HI>time of need,</HI> with greater <HI>boldness,</HI> than the <HI>High-Priest</HI> under the Law could once a Year enter into the <HI>Holiest of all.</HI></P>
<P>THUS the <HI>Gospel</HI> in regard of the <HI>Effects</HI> produced by it, is more glorious than the <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P N="7">VII. <HI>THE Gospel is far more glorious than the Law in respect of the</HI> Duration <HI>of it.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THERE is verily a disannulling of the command∣ment going before, for the weakness and unprofitable∣ness thereof,</HI> Heb. 7.18. An end is put to the Legal Dispensation, but the Evangelical shall continue to the End of the World, Matth. 28.19, 20. <HI>Go ye there∣fore and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name, of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost: Teaching them to observe all things whatso∣ever I have commanded you: and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the End of the World.</HI> Had there been no defect in the Legal, GOD would not have introduc'd the Evangelical Dispensation: The Change is to the better: GOD will not alter or abrogate the present Dispensation, because there is not a better to succeed in the room of it, Heb. 12.26, 27. <HI>Whose voice then shook the Earth, but now he hath pro∣mised, saying, yet once more I shake not the Earth only, but also Heaven. And this word, yet once more, signifieth the removing of those things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those things which cannot be shaken may remain.</HI> The LORD'S voice shook the Earth, when he deliver'd the Law at <HI>Sinai;</HI> the whole Mount quaked greatly: but he shook not the Earth only, but also Heaven, the Jewish Church-State, at the bringing in of the <HI>Gospel.</HI> And he removed the Types and Ordinances of the Law, as things never designed by him the Appointer and Founder of them, to continue always; and so made way for the Introduction &amp; Establishment of the <HI>Gos∣pel</HI> and the Ordinances thereof, which are things that cannot be shaken, but shall remain to the End of the
<PB N="24" REF="003029_0027_0FEFAEDBDD6F6298"/>
World. The Gospel-state is that <HI>Kingdom which cannot be moved.</HI> The Angel which <HI>John</HI> saw fly∣ing in the midst of Heaven, (which might denote the speed and diligence of <HI>Christ</HI>'s faithful Ambassa∣dors) <HI>had the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the Earth,</HI> Rev. 14.6. This proves the transcendent Excellency of the <HI>Gospel. For</HI> (as the Apostle saith in the verse following our Text) <HI>if that which was done away was glorious, much more that which remaineth is glorious.</HI></P>
<P>IN these respects the <HI>Gospel</HI> exceedeth the <HI>Law</HI> in Glory, and so far that even that which was made glo∣rious, had no Glory, in comparison of the Glory that excelleth.</P>
<P>HAVING thus Illustrated and Confirmed the Truth, I proceed to Apply it.</P>
<P N="1">1. IS the Gospel so much more glorious than the Law? We may hence infer <HI>the great Dignity of the Evangelical Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>IT is consistent with the Humility that shou'd cloath the Ministers of the <HI>lowly JESUS,</HI> to assert the Dig∣nity of their sacred Employment. The holy Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> who counted himself less than the least of all Saints, is, in the Chapter wherein our Text is, mag∣nifying his Office; and he strongly proves it honou∣rable from the transcendent Glory of the Gospel. His genuine Inference from his large Discourse concerning the Excellency of the Gospel is that in Ver. 12, 13. Cont. <HI>Seeing then that we have such hope, we use great plainness of speech, and not as Moses, who put a vail over his face.</HI> As if he had said, The Gospel being in so many respects more glorious than the Law, and especially since, according to our certain Expecta∣tion, it shall continue to the End of the World, I am not ashamed of my ministration, but do thus boldly vindicate my Apostleship, and do not, as <HI>Moses</HI> vail the Glory which the LORD hath put upon me. The more excellent a divine Revelation is, the more noble
<PB N="25" REF="003029_0028_0FEFAEDE49D60160"/>
is their Office, who are sent with it to the Children of Men. It was glorious to be a Minister of the Law, it is much more so to be a Minister of the <HI>Gospel. John</HI> the Baptist, CHRIST'S Harbinger and Herald, was more than a Minister of the <HI>Law, more than a Prophet: The Law and the Prophets were until John:</HI> But in his Time <HI>Christ</HI> was actually exhibited, and he declar'd the <HI>Messiah</HI> to be already come, pointing him out, as it were with the Finger, saying, <HI>Behold the Lamb of GOD.</HI> So that <HI>John</HI>'s Mini∣stry excel'd any that was before; yet when our <HI>Sa∣viour</HI> was speaking of <HI>John</HI>'s greatness, he show'd that under the Evangelical Dispensation, when the Gospel shou'd be fully preached, the least Minister thereof wou'd, in respect of his Office, be greater than <HI>John,</HI> be a more honourable Officer than he, Matth. 11.11. <HI>Verily I say unto you, among them that are born of women, there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist: notwithstanding, he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven, is greater than he.</HI> The more glorious a Kingdom is, the more honourable is an Office in it: The Gospel Kingdom is termed the Kingdom of Heaven; the Glory of it exceeds that of all the Kingdoms of this World: To be a Mini∣ster therefore of CHRIST'S spiritual Kingdom on Earth, is no mean Preferment. No <HI>Man taketh this Honour unto himself,</HI> without horrid Usurpation, <HI>but he that is called of GOD</HI> to this high and holy Office, shou'd be very humble and thankful; saying with the great Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> Eph. 3.8. <HI>Unto me, who am less than the least of all Saints, is this Grace given, that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable Riches of Christ:</HI> And, 1 Tim. 1.12. <HI>I thank Christ Jesus our Lord who hath enabled me, for that he counted me faithful, putting me into the Ministry.</HI>— And they unto whose Trust the glorious Gospel of the blessed GOD is committed, should be careful to support the Dignity of their Office, which they can do in no such effectual way, as by discharging faith∣fully the Duties belonging to it— And let <HI>every Man so account of them, as the Ministers of Christ,
<PB N="26" REF="003029_0029_0FEFAEE164F34638"/>
and Stewards of the mysteries of God:</HI> and this is to count them <HI>worthy of double honour,</HI> and to <HI>esteem them very highly in Love for their work's sake.</HI> That is spoken of, and in the New-Testament is directly ap∣ply'd to the Ministers of the glorious Gospel, which we read in Isa. 52.7. <HI>How beautiful upon the moun∣tains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace, that bringeth good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith unto Zion, thy God reigneth.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. DOTH the Gospel exceed the Law in Glory? then <HI>the Sin of Despising it is very great.</HI></P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the Gospel is so incomparably glorious, yet there are multitudes that despise it. When it was first published to the World, the generality of Men look'd upon it as a very mean or ridiculous Doctrine, and not worthy to be regarded by Ratio∣nal Beings: They called the Preaching of it <HI>foolishness.</HI> And the most of Men do not entertain a better Opinion of it, at this Day: Some despise it so as to reject the Knowledge of it; they have no desire and take no pains to understand the glorious Truths contained in it. Some are <HI>ashamed of the Gospel of CHRIST,</HI> asham'd to profess it; and how light do Sinners com∣monly make of the Overtures of Grace therein? All who believe not in CHRIST, and walk not accor∣ding to the Rules of the Gospel, are guilty of despi∣sing it. He that breaks the Law despiseth it, 2 Sam. 12.9. <HI>Wherefore hast thou despised the Commandment of the Lord, to do evil in his sight?</HI> So all who dis∣obey the Gospel despise it; and the greatness of their Sin and Folly appears from the Glory of the Gospel. The more excellent any thing is, the more vile is the Contempt of it. As much as the Gospel exceeds the Law in Glory, so much worse is it for Men to despise the Gospel than the Law, and exposeth them to so much heavier Punishments. Heb. 10.28, 29. <HI>He that despised Moses Law, died without mercy, under two or three witnesses: of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy, who hath
<PB N="27" REF="003029_0030_0FEFAEE4C2131120"/>
trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sancti∣fied, and unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the Spirit of Grace?</HI> Contempt of the Gospel is treading the Son of GOD underfoot, as if he were really a <HI>Worm</HI> and <HI>no Man,</HI> much less GOD: It is <HI>setting of him at nought,</HI> as truly as <HI>Herod</HI> with his Men of War did, when they made a mock-King of him: It is trampling the Redeemer's Grace, as if it were nothing worth: And it is counting his pre∣cious Blood, which is <HI>the Blood of the Covenant,</HI> an unholy, a common thing; such as pollutes rather than purifies the Soul. Despising the Gospel is <HI>doing De∣spite unto the Spirit of Grace,</HI> the holy Ghost, which accompanies the Gospel to perswade Men of the Truth and Excellency of it, and to make it of saving Efficacy to them. So great is the Sin of Gospel-Contempt that <HI>Christ</HI> said concerning those who were guilty of despi∣sing the Law and the Prophets, Joh. 16.22 — 24. <HI>If I had not come, and spoken unto them, they had not had Sin: but now they have no cloke for their Sin — If I had not done among them the works which none other man did, they had not had Sin: but now they have both seen, and hated both me and my father.</HI> The righteous GOD punisheth this Sin with the greatest Judgments, temporal, spiritual and eternal. Wrath came not upon the Jews <HI>to the uttermost,</HI> un∣til they despised and persecuted the Gospel, Mat. 22.7. <HI>When the King heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent forth his Armies,</HI> (the Romans) <HI>and destroyed those murderers, and burnt up their City.</HI> The sorest outward Calamities are brought on a People, who en∣joy the Gospel, for their Contempt of it. GOD is provoked by Men's despising the Gospel, to smite them with Judicial Blindness, so that they never shall see the Glory of it, <HI>Joh.</HI> 12.40, 41. They who con∣temptuously shut their Eyes against the light of the Gospel, GOD often Judicially closeth their Eyes, and delivers them to the Power of Satan to blind them, 2 Cor. 4.3, 4. <HI>If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them
<PB N="28" REF="003029_0031_0FEFAEE739014EB8"/>
that are lost: In whom the God of this world hath blinded the eyes of those that believe not, lest the light of the glorious Gospel of Christ, who is the Image of God, should shine unto them.</HI> The Despisers of the Gospel shall be punished with everlasting Destruction: And it will be <HI>more tolerable,</HI> not only for <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> but also for the Despisers of <HI>Moses</HI> Law in the Day of Judgment, than for them, 2 Thes. 1.7, 8. <HI>The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from Heaven, with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI> — Now consider this, ye that contemn the glorious Gospel, and <HI>beware lest that come upon you which is spoken of in the Pro∣phets: Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. LET what hath been said, <HI>raise our Esteem of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>THAT which is glorious ought to be valu'd by us, and according to the degree of it's Excellence. The Display of the transcendent Glory of the Gospel shou'd excite and confirm in us a due Esteem of it. — What hath been said concerning the Glory of the Gospel, disparageth not the Law, and will not justify the Con∣tempt of it. The Law is glorious, and deserveth esteem. It was a most suitable Revelation for the People to whom, and the Time wherein it was gran∣ted. Infinite Wisdom judg'd it fit that the discovery of GOD'S Mind &amp; Will concerning the Salvation of fallen Man, shou'd be like the dawning <HI>Light, which shineth more and more unto the perfect day.</HI> A meri∣dian Brightness was not proper for the Morning of the Church Times. Under the Law the Church was, as it were, in her non-age; and the Instructions GOD gave were suited to her Capacity. Believers were then Children, and the Law was their School-master, to teach them the Elements, the Rudiments, the first Principles of divine Knowledge: Gal. 3.24. <HI>The Law was our School-master to bring us unto Christ:</HI> It was to prepare the Church for the <HI>University</HI> of the Gos∣pel,
<PB N="29" REF="003029_0032_0FEFAEE8DF64BE40"/>
in which the Knowledge of <HI>Christ</HI> is more fully taught. GOD vouchsafed further light to his People by extraordinary Prophets which he sent unto them: He at <HI>sundry Times, and in diverse manners, spake unto the Fathers by the Prophets,</HI> who predicted what the Law prefigur'd, and gave many Promises of the <HI>Messiah.</HI> Yet it was not perfect day-light until the <HI>Sun of Righteousness</HI> arose; then the shadows fled away, "and the whole Horizon of heavenly Truth was disclos'd." So that altho' the Law was glorious the divine Revelation before the fulness of Time came was excellent, and to be greatly esteemed, yet the Gos∣pel is far more glorious, and to be more highly va∣lued. The Instructions of the Law were <HI>beggarly Ele∣ments,</HI> mean Rudiments, in comparison of the deeper and more full Instructions of the Gospel. That is a notable Prophecy concerning the Evangelical Dispen∣sation, Jer. 3.14, 15, 16. <HI>I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion. And I will give you Pastors according to mine heart, which shall feed you with knowledge &amp; under∣standing. And it shall come to pass when ye be mul∣tiplied and increased in the Land; In those days, saith the Lord, they shall say no more, The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord: neither shall it come to mind, neither shall they remember it, neither shall they visit it, neither shall that be done any more.</HI> The days of the Messiah are here intended, in which GOD'S People should be fed with Wisdom and Understanding, by faithful evangelical Pastors, in a way different from the Jewish Institution. And their prizing the Gospel Dispensation above the former, is express'd by their not remembring, mentioning, nor visiting the <HI>Ark of the Covenant.</HI> The Ark was called, <HI>The Glory;</HI> it was very much the Glory of <HI>Israel:</HI> It was an eminent Type of <HI>Christ,</HI> (the Glory of his People;) and a Symbol of GOD'S Presence with his ancient Church. The Old-Testament Saints had it in high account; nothing was more precious unto them: yet it is here foretold, that when <HI>Christ,</HI> the Antitype of the
<PB N="30" REF="003029_0033_0FEFAEEA98E5B7E0"/>
Ark, should he come, and a more spiritual Worship erected, then there should be no mention made of the <HI>Ark,</HI> it should not be remembred, nor come into mind, <HI>neither shall that be done any more in it,</HI> or, as the Margin renders this, <HI>It shall not be magnified any more,</HI> It shall not be had in honour or respect, or be made much of. The whole <HI>ceremonial Law</HI> is not to be valued in comparison of the glorious <HI>Gospel;</HI> nor the <HI>carnal</HI> Ordinances of the former, to be men∣tioned in the same day with the <HI>spiritual</HI> Ordinances of the latter. The <HI>moral Law</HI> is to be highly esteem'd. GOD will <HI>magnify this Law, and make it honourable.</HI> It is truly excellent and honourable in it self; and the things of it are <HI>great things,</HI> and shou'd be so in our account. But the moral Law is only a Revelation of GOD'S Will concerning Man's Duty, not of his Good-Will concerning Man's Sal∣vation. It sheweth us what we ought to do, and con∣demns us for not doing it, and leaves us without hope of escaping it's dreadful Curse. It is a perfect Rule of Obedience, but affords no strength unto impotent Man to walk according to it. Now the Gospel doth not make void the Law, as it is a perfect Rule of Life and Manners, but re-inforceth it, and farther shews how the Sinner may be freed from the Curse, revealing a Righteousness that answers the Demands of the Law, and offers Strength to enable us sincerely &amp; acceptably to keep the divine Precepts. All the intrinsic Glory which the <HI>moral Law</HI> hath, the <HI>Gospel</HI> hath, and much more: We should therefore give the <HI>Gospel</HI> the preference to the <HI>Law</HI> in our esteem. GOD'S Law was more desired by his Saints than <HI>Gold, yea than much fine Gold,</HI> It was better to them than <HI>Thousands of Gold &amp; Silver.</HI> How then ought we to prize the glorious Gospel? It is an inestirnable Pearl we shou'd be willing to part with all things rather than to be with∣out it, Matth. 13.4<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 46. <HI>The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a merchant-man, seeking goodly Pearls: who when he had found one Pearl of great price, he went and sold all that he had, and bought it.</HI> How
<PB N="31" REF="003029_0034_0FEFAEEDD3794A60"/>
were the ancient Promises valued by those who looked for Redemption? Heb. 11.1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>These all died in Faith, not having received <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Promises</HI> (<HI>i. e.</HI> The Accomplishment of them in the actual Exhibition of the <HI>Messiah) but having seen them afar off, and were perswaded of them, and imbraced them.</HI> As good old <HI>Simeon</HI> took up CHRIST in his Arms, so the Patriarchs by Faith imbraced the Promises, "salu∣ted and hugged them," as the original word imports. When they meditated on the Promises, did they not cry out, <HI>Oh dear precious Promises that will in time yield the</HI> Messiah! How then ought we to value the Gospel, which is the completion of those Promises? Shall we not embrace the <HI>glorious</HI> Gospel: count it <HI>worthy of all acceptation?</HI> worthy to be receiv'd with all readiness of Mind, and strength of Affec∣tion.</P>
<P N="4">4. LET us all be solicitous that <HI>the Gospel may produce it's glorious Effects in our Souls.</HI></P>
<P>WE have seen that the Gospel is far more glorious than the Law in regard of those wonderful Effects produced by it in the Souls of Men: We should be anxiously concern'd that this Glory of the Gospel be manifested and magnified in our Conversion &amp; Salva∣tion. There must indeed be first a Work of the Law on our Hearts, convincing us of Sin and Wrath, to prepare us for a Work of the Gospel, in Changing our Hearts, and encouraging us to believe in <HI>Christ</HI> We must seek, that the <HI>Commandment</HI> may come with power on our Souls, to revive the sense of our Guilt and Misery, and to slay us; to make us see that we are condemned Malefactors, dead in Trespasses and Sins: and then that the Gospel may come unto us in <HI>Power, &amp; in the holy Ghost,</HI> to give us life. We must look for a saving Change to be wro't in us by the Gospel, as a fit Instrument in the Hand of GOD'S <HI>Spi∣rit.</HI> The <HI>moral Law</HI> was never design'd for this use. If ever we be spiritually <HI>begotten,</HI> it must be <HI>thro' the Gospel.</HI> The Children of Promise the Heirs
<PB N="32" REF="003029_0035_0FEFAEF13804C648"/>
of Salvation are not born of the <HI>Bond-woman,</HI> Gal. 4.22, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> All the Terrors on Mount <HI>Sinai</HI> will not drive a Sinner out of his natural Estate, home unto <HI>Christ.</HI> There must be a <HI>Hope</HI> set before him, or he will not <HI>fly for Refuge.</HI> It is not the sight of GOD'S Glory in the Glass of the Law, but of the Gospel that is transforming. The Glory on the Face of <HI>Moses,</HI> which was such that the Israelites could not stedfastly behold him, is not sufficient; there must be a discovery of the <HI>Glory of GOD in the Face of JESUS CHRIST,</HI> in order to a saving Illumi∣nation. The Glory of divine Mercy &amp; Wisdom in our Redemption by CHRIST, must be seen by him that believes in CHRIST, and is transformed into his Image. Let us therefore give <HI>earnest heed</HI> to the Gospel, as the Instituted ordinary Means of thorow Conversion. Let it be our great Care, vehement De∣sire and constant Prayer, that the Gospel may <HI>work effectually in us, as it doth in all them that believe</HI>—May be <HI>the Power of God unto our Salvation.</HI> How sad is it, if we who now speak, and hear so much of the Glory of the Gospel, experience nothing of it's Power on our Hearts, changing of them, and carrying on a Work of Grace in them! How dreadful is it, to have the glorious Gospel prove a <HI>savour of Death unto Death!</HI> Let us pray that it may <HI>come to us, not in Word only,</HI> (for then it will eventually be a <HI>killing Letter,</HI> as well as the Law) <HI>but also in power, and in the holy Ghost;</HI> that so it's Glory may be exem∣plify'd and display'd in our Salvation.</P>
<P N="5">5. FROM what has been said, Let us be incited to <HI>a more diligent Study of the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>THE Glory of GOD is more fully and clearly re∣veal'd in the Gospel, than it is in the Law: But we cannot see it, nor be affected with it, unless we apply our Minds to the study of the Gospel. The Mysteries of the Gospel afford the most delightful Entertainment to inquisitive Minds. The ancient <HI>Prophets,</HI> who foretold something of the Glory of the Gospel, us'd
<PB N="33" REF="003029_0036_0FEFAEF2D2A49540"/>
to study their own Prophecies concerning it, 1 Pet. 1.10, 11, 12. <HI>Of which Salvation the Prophets have enquired, and searched diligently, who prophesied of the Grace that should come unto you: searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify, when it testified before∣hand the sufferings of Christ, and the Glory that should follow: Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto us they did minister the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the Gospel, with the holy Ghost coming down from Heaven, which things the Angels desire to look into.</HI> The holy Prophets with great diligence and delight searched into those unfathomable Myste∣ries of Grace, that were in dark Expressions spoken of by themselves, as moved by the Spirit of GOD, and which are more fully and clearly declared in the Gos∣pel: <HI>Which Things</HI> (saith the Apostle) <HI>the Angels desire to look into.</HI> This Expression is allusive to the <HI>Cherubims</HI> which were over the Ark, a Type of <HI>Christ,</HI> looking down earnestly upon it, as if they would pry into it. The blessed <HI>Angels, who behold the Face of GOD in Heaven,</HI> do as it were turn their Eyes from viewing his Glory in the upper World, and bend down their sacred Heads to look into the glorious Mysteries of the Gospel. The manifold Wisdom of GOD made known to the Principalities and Powers in heavenly Places, by the Dispensation of his Grace toward the Church, is wonderful and ravishing to them. And shall not we study those things, which the glorious Angels think so worthy their Contemplations? Let us faithfully improve all Means, that are proper and appointed for our Information in the great and impor∣tant Truths of the Gospel. Let us, with the very learned Apostle <HI>Paul, Count all things but loss for the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jesus, our Lord.</HI> — And as <HI>David</HI> prayed unto GOD, saying, <HI>Open thou mine Eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy Law;</HI> so let us pray that GOD
<PB N="34" REF="003029_0037_0FEFAEF54E086458"/>
would open our Eyes, that we may behold more won∣drous things out of his Gospel.</P>
<P N="6">6. LET Christians be Exhorted to <HI>adorn the glori∣ous Gospel, the Doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</HI></P>
<P>WE cannot add to the intrinsick Glory of the Gos∣pel, but we should testify and declare it's Excellency by having our Conversation in the World <HI>as becometh the Gospel of Christ.</HI> It is a Reproach to the glori∣ous Gospel, and brings it into Contempt, when those who profess it walk not according to the holy and ex∣cellent Rules of it, Rom. 2.23, 24. <HI>Thou that ma∣kest thy boast of the Law, thro' breaking the Law dishonourest thou God? For the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles thro' you.</HI> So when Professors of Christianity disobey the Precepts of it, they darken the Glory of the Gospel, and dishonour the Name of <HI>Christ.</HI> We <HI>receive the Grace of GOD</HI> the Gospel <HI>in vain,</HI> as to our own Souls, unless we conform our Lives to it: as it is shown they had as good have been without the Law, who did not keep it, Jer. 8.8. <HI>How do ye say, we are wise, and the Law of the Lord is with us? Lo, certainly in vain made he it, the Pen of the Scribes is in vain.</HI> And we render the Gospel unprofitable to others also by our unsuitable Lives: We increase and confirm their Prejudices, which hinder their seeing the Glory of the Gospel.— But the Lustre of a godly Conversation is an Ornament to the glorious Gospel, which we profess. The regular Practice of all the duties which the Gospel requires, sets forth the Glory of the Gospel to best Advantage, and recommends it to those, before whom our Light shineth, and may convince even Infidels that the Gospel came from the <HI>GOD of Glory.</HI> Christians of the lowest Rank are obliged thus to adorn the Gospel, Tit. 2.9, 10 <HI>Let our Conversation</HI> therefore <HI>be as it becometh the Gospel of Christ,</HI> Phil. 1.27. 1 Thes. 2.11, 12. <HI>As ye know how we exhorted, and comforted, and
<PB N="35" REF="003029_0038_0FEFAEF931FFB2A8"/>
charged every one of you, as a father doth his chil∣dren; That ye would walk worthy of God, who hath called you unto his Kingdom &amp; Glory.</HI></P>
<P N="7">7. LET us be very <HI>Thankful to GOD</HI> for the Gos∣pel.</P>
<P>WHAT hath been said concerning the Glory of the Gospel (tho' <HI>one half hath not been told</HI>) may well excite our thankful Praises unto GOD for it. <HI>What Advantage had the Jews</HI> above the Gentiles? <HI>Much every way, chiefly because that unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</HI> And Christians have a vast advantage above the Jews, in that the <HI>glori∣ous Gospel of the Blessed GOD</HI> is committed unto them. <HI>GOD hath provided some better thing for us, that they without us should not be made perfect.</HI> The Gospel is a greater Glory unto a People, among whom it is dispensed in the Power &amp; Purity of it, than the Ark was to Israel; and more Glory is due therefor unto GOD from those who enjoy it. How glad would the <HI>Patriarchs</HI> and <HI>Prophets</HI> of old have been, to have seen and heard what we do under the Evangelical Dispensation? Matth. 13.16, 17. <HI>But blessed are your Eyes, for they see; and your Ears, for they hear: for verily I say unto you, that many Prophets and righteous Men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have not seen them: and to hear those things, which ye hear; and have not heard them.</HI> They indeed by the Per∣spective of Faith saw the promised Blessings; but they saw them <HI>afar off,</HI> had but an obscure View of them to what is now granted. With the Eagle-Eye of Faith <HI>Abraham</HI> saw the Day of Gospel-light at a great distance, and the remote Prospect which he had of it, made him to rejoice greatly, Joh. 8.56. <HI>Your Father Abraham rejoyced to see my day: and he saw it, and was glad.</HI> Should not those who live in that day, much more rejoyce in, and be thankful for the Light and Glory of it?

He hath not dealt so with any nation: And as for his judgments they have not known them. Praise ye the Lord.</HI> Should not we much more praise him for sending the <HI>glo∣rious Gospel</HI> unto us, when so many Nations in the World are as yet destitute of it? Luke 10.21. <HI>In that hour Jesus rejoyced in spirit, and said, I thank thee, O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, that thou hast hid these things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.</HI></P>

</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OUR Blessed SAVIOUR speaking to his Disciples of the calamitous Destruction which shou'd be brought on <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> warn'd them to flee out of it, when they shou'd see the <HI>Abomination of Desolation standing in the holy Place: i. e.</HI> The Roman Ar∣my besieging the City. In the verse immediately pre∣ceding our Text he said, <HI>In that day, he which shall be in the house-top, and his staff in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not turn back:</HI> As if he had said, Let every one of my Servants make all possi∣ble haste to get out of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> when the Judg∣ments of GOD shall be irresistibly breaking in upon it. And to press this Advice, and excite them to flee with the greatest speed, He added these words, <HI>Re∣member Lot's Wife.</HI> — And what he said to them, he now saith to us all, whom he is warning to flee from Wrath, <HI>Remember Lot's Wife.</HI> We should remem∣ber her, not for our Imitation, but for our Admonition and Awakning. — We should remember her Sin, and her Punishment, and may receive much Instruc∣tion and spiritual Profit therefrom.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="40" REF="003029_0042_0FEFAF030EDF3870"/>I. <HI>WE shou'd remember the</HI> SIN <HI>of Lot's Wife.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is recorded, Gen. 19.26. <HI>His Wife looked back from behind him.</HI> In her flight from <HI>Sodom</HI> she looked back. But how was this a Sin? Wherein consisted the sinfulness of her so doing? What fault was it for a poor distressed Woman to look back upon the City where she had dwelt, and where her Friends &amp; Acquaintance were, and from whence she was taking her final Departure? Might she not without offence turn her Eyes upon <HI>Sodom</HI> as she was escaping from it? Might she not see it once more before it was utterly consumed? Might she not cast an Eye of Pity towards, and Weep for her miserable Neighbours in flames of Brimstone?</P>
<P>HER looking back was sinful,</P>
<P N="1">1. BECAUSE it was contrary to a <HI>divine Prohibition.</HI></P>
<P><HI>SIN is a Transgression of the Law. Lot's</HI> Wive's looking back on <HI>Sodom</HI> was the Transgression of a particular Law, the breach of an express Order given them, Gen. 19.17. <HI>It came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad, that he said, Escape for thy Life, look not behind thee. Lot</HI>'s Wife, as well as he, was solemnly Charged not to <HI>look behind;</HI> so that she did that which was expresly and plainly forbidden her. And to act contrary to the least Commandment, or Prohibition of the great GOD, is no small offence, no petty fault. <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wive's Diso∣bedience may be illustrated by that of <HI>Saul</HI>'s, in spa∣ring the best of the <HI>Amalekites</HI> Sheep and Oxen for Sacrifice; This was very offensive to GOD, because contrary to an express Order given him to slay them all: The Prophet thus set his Sin before him, 1 Sam. 15, 22, 23. <HI>Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt-offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of Rams. For rebellion is as the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of witchcraft, and stubbornness it is as iniquity and idolatry. Saul</HI>'s rebellion in that matter, which was in it self small, was as really a Sin, &amp; Provocation
<PB N="41" REF="003029_0043_0FEFAF04A9D96100"/>
of GOD'S Wrath as Witchcraft or Idolatry. It was a Contempt of the great Lawgiver's Authority. And so was <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wive's looking back. <HI>Abraham</HI> the same Morning looked toward <HI>Sodom,</HI> and saw the smoke of it's Torments ascending, <HI>Gen.</HI> 19.27, 28. This was no Sin in <HI>Abraham,</HI> for he was not for∣bidden to look toward <HI>Sodom:</HI> But it was a great Sin in <HI>Lot's Wife</HI> to look back upon it, for the Lord had said to her, <HI>Look not behind thee.</HI></P>
<P>THIS teacheth us, to measure Sin by the Command∣ment; and so it will appear <HI>exceeding sinful.</HI> Persons are ready to make light of many evil Actions, and to stroke them with a gentle Censure, because they are not so gross &amp; crying as others. But the matter in which we Sin is not so much to be regarded, as the Authority which is thereby despised. What is in it self small &amp; inconsi∣derable is a great offence, if the Lord hath forbidden it. The first Woman took of the fruit of a certain Tree in <HI>Eden,</HI> and eat it. Could so small a thing as the eat∣ing an Apple be very offensive to GOD? Yet <HI>the Lord God said unto the Woman, What is this thou hast done?</HI> Gen. 3.13. What an heinous Crime hast thou committed? Because GOD had expresly said, <HI>Of that Tree thou shalt not eat.</HI> GOD'S Authority is con∣temned, his Will resisted by our doing the least thing which he hath forbidden; therefore no such Act must be accounted by us a small offence. We should not say of it, as <HI>Lot</HI> did of <HI>Zoar,</HI> which he desir'd might be spared to be the City of his Refuge, <HI>Is it not a little One?</HI> Sometimes the smaller the matter is in which we transgress, the greater is the Offence; as when the Prohibition of it is very plain &amp; peremp∣tory, the Temptation unto it slight, and it be a thing which might easily be left undone. Whatsoever we do contrary to the declared Will of GOD, is a horrid In∣dignity offer'd to his Majesty &amp; Authority: It is Re∣bellion, which in every case is as the Sin of Witchcraft and Idolatry.</P>
<P N="2">2. IN <HI>Lot's Wive's</HI> looking back upon <HI>Sodom</HI> there was a <HI>Contempt of GOD's Omniscience.</HI></P>
<P>SHE not only despis'd the Authority &amp; Com∣mandment
<PB N="42" REF="003029_0044_0FEFAF07E1BAA4C0"/>
of GOD, but also practically deny'd his Omniscience: for it is said, that she <HI>locked back from behind Lot.</HI> She committed this Sin secretly. She was behind her Husband; and since his Eye was not upon her, she ventur'd to look back; thereby expres∣sing a Contempt of GOD'S all-seeing Eye. She was afraid that if <HI>righteous Lot</HI> saw her he wou'd be angry with her for disobeying the Lord; but not afraid that a <HI>Righteous GOD</HI> would see her, and be displea∣sed at her Sin. This is an aggravation of secret Sins, that the Omniscience of GOD is especially contemned thereby; as if the Eye of GOD was not to be so much regarded &amp; reverenc'd as the Eye of Man.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>LOT</HI>'s <HI>Wive's</HI> looking back on <HI>Sodom</HI> procee∣ded from an <HI>evil Heart of Unbelief.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Angels</HI> which came to <HI>Lot</HI>'s House, told him, and his Wife, that swift Destruction was coming upon <HI>Sodom: Lot</HI> inform'd his Sons in-law of it, and said unto them, <HI>Up, get ye out of this place, for the Lord will destroy this city: but he seemed unto them as one that mocked.</HI> Altho' his <HI>Wife</HI> did not reject the Warning with such scorn, as they did, yet it seems, that she question'd the Truth of the Threatning, and therefore look'd back to see whether it would be Executed or not. It was said to her, <HI>Look not behind thee, lest thou be consumed.</HI> But she did not believe she shou'd be consumed for looking back. It is said in the Book of the <HI>Wisdom of Solomon,</HI> chap. 10. v. 7. <HI>That a standing Pillar of Salt, is a Monument of an unbelieving Soul.</HI>—Not to believe GOD, is to make him a Liar: It is a great Sin, to doubt of his Veracity in his Menaces, as well as Promises. Such Unbelief is the Root of Disobedience. Men despise the Com∣mandments of GOD, because they do not believe his Threatnings, Heb. 3.12. <HI>Take heed, Brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief, in de∣parting from the living God.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THERE was the <HI>Lust of the Eye</HI> in <HI>Lot's Wive's</HI> looking back upon <HI>Sodom.</HI></P>
<P>"IT was a look of Covetousness". <HI>Sodom</HI> was a rich and pleasant place: It was even <HI>as the Garden of
<PB N="43" REF="003029_0045_0FEFAF09F4D227E0"/>
the Lord,</HI> Gen. 13.10. <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife was very loth to go out of it; she lingered in it, (as indeed <HI>Lot</HI> himself did) after she was warned to flee; the An∣gels laid hold on her hand, and brought her forth, and set her without the City, <HI>plucking her as a Brand out of the Fire:</HI> and she went not far from <HI>Sodom</HI> before her Love to her worldly accommodations there, made her look back, with uneasy Desires to return to it, there to enjoy the Wealth, Pleasures &amp; Friends which she had left. So that her Sin was great: her Rebellion was as the Sin of Idolatry, for <HI>Covetousness is Idolatry:</HI> It is loving and serving the Crea∣ture more than the Creator. We cannot obey GOD, so long as this Lust remains unmortified: We may seem to hearken to his Call for a time, and to flee from Wrath; but if we love the World, and the things of it, we shall look, and draw back unto Perdition, 2 Tim. 4.10. <HI>Demas hath forsaken me, having lo∣ved this present World.</HI> We should remember <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, that we may <HI>take heed and beware of Cove∣tousness.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>LOT</HI>'s Wive's looking back on <HI>Sodom</HI> imply'd a <HI>Contempt of the Mercy of GOD</HI> in delivering her out of it.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Lord</HI> was about to rain "Hell out of Heaven" upon <HI>Sodom,</HI> and the Neighbouring Cities, he sent his Angels (and one of them was the blessed Angel of the Covenant, for he is stiled <HI>Jehovah,</HI> Gen. 19.24.) GOD sent them to bring out <HI>Lot,</HI> and his Wife and Children, that they might not be consumed in the Iniquity &amp; Overthrow of <HI>Sodom.</HI> The <HI>Lord</HI> being <HI>merciful</HI> did this: <HI>Lot</HI> spake of it with Admiration, say∣ing, <HI>Behold now, thy Servant hath found Grace in thy sight, and thou hast magnified thy mercy which thou hast shewed unto me in saving my Life.</HI> But his Wife despised so great a Mercy; she had low Thot's of it: she did not accept the miraculous Deliverance with Thankfulness: she was so unsuitably affected with the Kindness GOD had shown her in saving her Life, that she look'd back on <HI>Sodom</HI> with a discontented Eye, be∣cause she was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> from her worldly Enjoyments there.
<PB N="44" REF="003029_0046_0FEFAF0D4EB70B48"/>
This vile Ingratitude made her Sin so heinous in GOD'S sight. When Mercy is despised, Wrath is ex∣asperated: Sins committed after signal Deliverances, are exceedingly aggravated. Ezra 9.13, 14.— <HI>Seeing that thou our God hast given us such Deliverance as this, should we again break thy Commandments?</HI> The gracious GOD hath sent the chief of those Angels which he sent to <HI>Sodom,</HI> the glorious increated Angel, the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> into the World, to deliver us from the everlasting Burnings of Hell: Let us not imi∣tate <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife in despising this great Mercy.</P>
<P>THUS we should remember and improve the <HI>Sin</HI> of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>WE shou'd remember the</HI> PUNISHMENT <HI>of</HI> Lot's <HI>Wife:</HI> the terrible Judgment which GOD inflicted upon her.</P>
<P>THIS is recorded for our Admonition, Gen. 19.26. <HI>She became a Pillar of Salt.</HI> When she looked back, she was struck dead upon the spot, and was turned into a <HI>Pillar of Salt.</HI> By her becoming a Pillar of Salt, some I think, understand no more than her being made a lasting Monument of GOD'S severe Justice; as a perpe∣tual Covenant is stiled a <HI>Covenant of Salt,</HI> Num. 18.19. But why the literal Sense of the words should be rejec∣ted, I can see no Reason; but do believe that she was really turned into a <HI>Pillar,</HI> a Statue <HI>of Salt,</HI> a kind of rocky, mineral Salt, which will endure all Weathers and not waste away. <HI>Naturalists</HI> write of Salt which is hard enough for Buildings.— <HI>Josephus,</HI> who lived since <HI>Christ</HI> was on Earth, saith that the Pillar of Salt was standing in his Time, and that He himself had seen it. And the like is affirmed by others since his time. — We are now call'd to look upon it with the Eyes of our Minds.</P>
<P N="1">1. WE shou'd remember the Punishment of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, because it represents to us the <HI>evil Nature,</HI> and <HI>infinite Demerit</HI> of Sin.</P>
<P><HI>LOT</HI>'s Wives Punishment was severe &amp; dreadful, yet it did not exceed the desert of her Crime, for look∣ing back upon <HI>Sodom,</HI> she was turned into a <HI>Pillar of Salt.</HI>—By this we may learn, That there is more Evil
<PB N="45" REF="003029_0047_0FEFAF106F400220"/>
in every Sin, than Men are aware of: It is more dis∣pleasing to the <HI>holy GOD</HI> than we can imagine it to be: GOD'S Thot's of Sin are not as Man's; his ac∣count of it and Man's are very different. The Infi∣nite Being against whom Sin is committed, and who only knows the Malignity &amp; Demerit of it, does not make light of the smallest Sin. <HI>The Wages of</HI> every <HI>Sin is Death.</HI> And the righteous GOD, to shew his Hatred of Sin, and what a heavy Punishment it de∣serves, sometimes in this World remarkably executes Vengeance upon Men, for those Faults, which to a common Eye appear small &amp; inconsiderable. He that turned <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife into a Pillar of Salt, for looking back on <HI>Sodom,</HI> struck <HI>Uzzah</HI> dead, for touching the Ark; and smote the Men of <HI>Bethshemesh</HI> Fifty Thou∣sand, threescore and ten, for looking into it. <HI>Behold therefore the severity of God: on them which fell severity,</HI> Rom. 11.22.— Jer. 2.19. <HI>Know therefore and see, that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of hosts.</HI>— On the <HI>Pillar of Salt</HI> is engraven the Desert &amp; Doom of every Sinner amongst us, and <HI>He that runs may read it. Lot</HI>'s Wife is thus set forth for an Example, shewing to us what we deserve for our Rebellion, Atheism, Unbelief, Covetousness, and Contempt of GOD'S Mercy. Was <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife a greater Sinner than You, or I? They are not always the greatest offenders, on whom GOD inflicts the most visible Judgments in this World, See <HI>Luk.</HI> 13.1, 2, 3, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We shou'd look upon the Pillar of Salt, that our Flesh may tremble for fear of GOD, and that we may be afraid of his Judg∣ments. The Desert of Sin is still the same, and GOD is immutably and impartially Just; what he hath done to others, he may do to us. It is certain, that unless our Repentance prevent, GOD'S Wrath will fall upon us, if not in such a manner, yet as terribly as it did upon <HI>Lot's</HI> Wife: and as it will be more tolerable for <HI>Sodom</HI> &amp; <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> so it will for <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife in the Day of Judgment, than for us, if we continue to neg∣lect &amp; despise the great Mercy of GOD in sending his
<PB N="46" REF="003029_0048_0FEFAF1201DF85D0"/>
Angel, the Lord JESUS, to deliver us from the Lake that burns with Fire &amp; Brimstone.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE shou'd remember the Punishment of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, and be convinced of the <HI>Folly and Danger of sinning in Secret.</HI></P>
<P>SHE looked back from behind <HI>Lot,</HI> so that he could not observe and reprove her; but she was before GOD, did that Evil in His sight, and He rebuk'd her in His Anger. GOD'S Judgments will sooner or later find Men out in their most secret Sins, Zeph. 1.12. <HI>I will search Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on their lees; that say in their heart, the Lord will not do good, neither will he do evil.</HI> There is no darkness, nor shadow of Death, in which the workers of Iniquity can hide themselves from his Eyes, which are as a flame of Fire. If we are Religious &amp; Pray in Secret, our gracious Father in Hea∣ven will reward us openly: But if we are Wicked, and Sin in Secret, our righteous Judge will punish us openly; if not in this World, yet sadly in that which is to come. Wo unto their Soul, who declare their Sin as <HI>Sodom,</HI> and hide it not: Wo also unto theirs, who conceal their Sin as <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, for GOD will reveal it, and reckon with them for it.</P>
<P N="3">3. WE shou'd remember <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wive's Punishment, and not desire, nor delight in the <HI>forbidden Society of vicious Persons, lest we be involved in their Ruin.</HI></P>
<P><HI>LOT</HI>'s Wife lingered in, and look'd back upon <HI>Sodom,</HI> wishing (most probably) that she might en∣joy the Company of her Friends &amp; Acquaintance there; and therefore she suffer'd with them. GOD's exemplary Vengeance was poured down on her at the same time, that it was on them; and it is probable in the same manner. Fire &amp; Brimstone might be rained on her, as well as on them. A judicious Divine thus expounds that Text, Gen. 19.24. <HI>The Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah, brimstone &amp; fire;</HI> that is, He consumed them by Thunder &amp; Lightning. Which (saith he) some of the Pagans had notice of, for <HI>Taci∣tus</HI> tells us, that those Cities were set on fire and burnt up by the stroke of Thunder. <HI>He adds,</HI> The
<PB N="47" REF="003029_0049_0FEFAF163392E180"/>
Saline Pillar which <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife was turned into, was probably the Effect of this wonderful Meteor; for from several Examples it appears, that Persons struck with Thunder have continued in the same Posture wherein they were when they were alive, and their dead Bodies are stiffned by the sulphurious Va∣pours penetrating them. But whether <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife was struck dead with a flash of that Fire which burned <HI>Sodom</HI> or not, yet she was destroyed with that wicked People; and as <HI>Sodom</HI> was turned into a Lake, Heaps and Pits of Salt <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gen.</HI> 14.3. <HI>Deut</HI> 29.23. <HI>Zeph.</HI> 2.9.</NOTE>, so <HI>Lot</HI>'s, Wife was turned into a <HI>Pillar of Salt.</HI> She partook of the same Curse. This is a Warning to us, not to hanker after the forbidden Society of lewd &amp; wicked Persons, lest we be destroyed with them. If we have fellowship with the unfruitful Works of Darkness, we shall be led forth with the Workers of Iniquity. If our Life be now among the Unclean, we may expect soon to have our part with them in the Lake which burneth with Fire &amp; Brim∣stone, Rev. 18.4. <HI>I heard another voice from Heaven, saying, Come out of her, my People, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. WE shou'd remember the Punishment of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, that sudden Destruction from <HI>GOD</HI> may be a <HI>Terror</HI> to us.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife looked back, she immediately became a <HI>Pillar of Salt:</HI> She was struck dead in a moment. This instance of GOD'S Wrath shou'd make us sensible how obnoxious we are to sudden Destructi∣on. The Long-suffering of GOD waited upon <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, while she lingred in <HI>Sodom;</HI> but when she looked back, his Wrath made quick work. GOD hath exer∣cis'd great Patience toward us, yet he may bring swift Destruction upon us, Isa. 42.13, 14. <HI>The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall pre∣vail against his Enemies. I have a long time held my peace, I have been still &amp; refrained my self, now will
<PB N="48" REF="003029_0050_0FEFAF18C1C34B40"/>
I cry like a travailing woman, I will destroy and devour at once.</HI> While we are in our Sins, we have no Security, no, not for one moment, from the destroy∣ing Judgments of GOD. Vengeance which hath been hitherto delayed, may overtake and surprize us in the next Act of Sin. If we proceed a step further in an evil Course, our feet may stumble, and we fall head-long into Perdition. We shou'd remember <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, and other Examples of sudden Destruction, and <HI>stand on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and nor sin.</HI> Let Unclean Persons remember <HI>Zimri</HI> &amp; <HI>Cozbi,</HI> on whom vengeance was executed in the very Act of their Uncleanness, <HI>Numb.</HI> 25.8. When any one is tempted to that wickedness, let him think of the Dart that striketh thro' the Liver, <HI>Prov.</HI> 7.23. Let proud &amp; arrogant Sinners remember <HI>Herod, whom the Angel of the Lord smote immediately,</HI> Acts 12.23. Let Riotous &amp; Profane Persons remember <HI>Belshazzar,</HI> who was slain in that Night, when his Heart was merry with Wine, and no Vessels but those of the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> wou'd serve him for a drunken Fro∣lick, Dan. 5. — Luk. 21.34. <HI>Take heed to your selves, lest at any time your hearts be over-charged with surfeiting and drunkenness, and the cares of this Life, and so that day come upon you unawares.</HI> Let all careless, sensual and worldly Wretches remember the Sinners of the old World, and of <HI>Sodom,</HI> who gave up themselves wholly to their secular Business and car¦nal Delights, till the Flood and the fiery Storm came and destroyed them all. Let us not put the evil Day far from us. "The Prophet gives us the Alarm like one that awakens a Family with the cry of <HI>Fire, Fire,</HI>" Zeph. 1.14. <HI>The great day of the Lord is near, it is near, and hasteth greatly.</HI> Peals of Warning are now sounded in our Ears both from the Word and the Pro∣vidence of GOD, and if our stupid Hearts are not moved with fear, and we do not flee from Wrath, we may look for sudden &amp; inevitable Destruction, Prov. 29.1. <HI>He that being often reproved, hardneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without re∣medy.</HI></P>
<P N="5"><PB N="49" REF="003029_0051_0FEFAF1BE0B5C398"/>5. WE shou'd remember the Judgment inflicted on <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, and fear lest we bring on our selves a <HI>strange Punishment.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was a strange Punishment, a Woman turned into a <HI>Pillar of Salt.</HI> Not only the suddenness, but also the strangeness of a Punishment is to be dreaded. The common Calamities of Mankind are apt to be look'd upon by too many, as the Effects of natural Causes only, or to be ascrib'd to <HI>Fortune:</HI> GOD there∣fore sometimes goes out of the beaten Road of his Ju∣dicial Dispensations, and inflicts some rare, extraordi∣nary Judgment, to awaken the drowsy World to take notice of his Hand. Numb. 16.29, 30, 31. <HI>If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men, then the Lord hath not sent me. But if the Lord make a new thing, and the Earth open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down quick into the Pit: then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the Lord. And it came to pass as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them: and the Earth opened her mouth &amp; swallowed them up.</HI> We should fear and tremble, lest GOD should visit us with some such unusual Judgment, Job 31.3. <HI>Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punish∣ment to the workers of iniquity?</HI> Destruction will certainly be their Portion, unless they Repent, and it may be brought upon them in some extraordinary and dreadful manner, Isa. 28.21. <HI>The Lord shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be wroth as in the val∣ley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his strange work; and bring to pass his act his strange act.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. WE shou'd remember the Punishment of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, and be <HI>deterred from Sin</HI> by the <HI>Shame</HI> which is the Fruit of it.</P>
<P>IT was a <HI>disgraceful</HI> Punishment that <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife suffered. The Pillar of Salt into which she was turned was a lasting Memorial of her Sin &amp; Folly, and perpe∣tuates her Shame. Men always dishonour GOD by sinning against him; and sometimes in punishing of
<PB N="50" REF="003029_0052_0FEFAF1D69773818"/>
them in this World he sets a mark of peculiar Infamy upon them, and causeth their Sins to be remembred to their Disgrace in after-Ages. His Judgments in∣flicted upon them are <HI>monumental Pillars,</HI> on which their Sins are written to their great reproach and perpetual shame. Some Punishments are like <HI>Pillars of Salt,</HI> not to keep Sinners Names from stinking in the nostrils of Posterity, but to preserve the Memory of them to their everlasting Disgrace. In some Exe∣cutions of divine Justice, GOD doth, as it were hang up Malefactors in Chains, and make them "Specta∣cles of public Shame". Ezek. 5.14, 15. <HI>I will make thee a reproach among the Nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all that pass by. So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment unto the Nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute Judgments in thee in anger, and in fury, and in furious rebukes.</HI></P>
<P>THUS in the Judgment inflicted on <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, there is much Instruction &amp; Warning given unto us. It may therefore be very profitable for us to remember her <HI>Punishment.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING spoken thus distinctly, <HI>first,</HI> Of the Sin, and <HI>secondly,</HI> Of the Punishment of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, and shown how we should remember &amp; improve each of them,— I would under a <HI>third</HI> general Head,</P>
<P N="3">III. CONSIDER them TOGETHER, and show what the Instruction &amp; Warning is, which they <HI>jointly</HI> afford us: and it is this, viz. <HI>That in our flight from</HI> mystical Sodom, <HI>we should not look back.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the chief &amp; comprehensive Benefit design'd us by the great Lover of our Souls, in calling upon us to <HI>remember Lot's Wife,</HI> namely, That we might be deter'd from looking back, when we are flying from Wrath. CHRIST said to his Disciples, <HI>In that Day</HI> (meaning the day of GOD'S vengeance against <HI>Jerusa∣lem) let not him that is in the field turn back. Re∣member Lot's Wife. As if he had said,</HI> You must
<PB N="51" REF="003029_0053_0FEFAF1EF7AC9040"/>
flee out of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with all possible speed, and beware lest you imitate <HI>Lot's</HI> Wife, who as she was escaping from <HI>Sodom</HI> looked back upon it, and for so doing was immediately turned into a <HI>Pillar of Salt.</HI> And what CHRIST said to them is applicable, and is now directed to us all in this solemn <HI>Memento</HI> and Caution,</P>
<P><HI>REMEMBER</HI> Lot's <HI>Wife, and in your flight from</HI> spiritual Sodom <HI>take heed that ye look not back, lest ye also be Consumed.</HI></P>
<P>THAT this Admonition may be set in a clear Light before our Understandings, and come with power on our Hearts and Consciences, and have a good Influ∣ence into our Behaviour, I wou'd observe to you,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>THAT while Men are in the Corrupt</HI> State of Nature, <HI>they are mystically in</HI> Sodom.</P>
<P>THEY are in such a Condition as <HI>Sodom</HI> was an Emblem of. They are so both in respect of the gross Pollution which they are wallowing in, and the dread∣ful Destruction which they are exposed to. <HI>Sodom</HI> was a very polluted and dangerous Place; the State of Na∣ture is such a State: All that are in it, are in as deep Pollution and great Danger, as those who dwelt in <HI>Sodom.</HI> — Let this two-fold Resemblance betwixt <HI>Sodom</HI> and a State of Nature be consider'd by us,</P>
<P N="1">1. UNCONVERTED Sinners may be fitly said to be in <HI>Sodom,</HI> in regard of that <HI>Pollution</HI> which they wallow in</P>
<P><HI>SODOM</HI> was a <HI>Sink</HI> of moral Pollution, in which the People like Swine did wallow: and so it repre∣sented the Corrupt State of Nature, in which the Children of Men are altogether filthy.</P>
<P>IT is said, Gen. 13.13. That <HI>the Men of</HI> Sodom <HI>were wicked, and sinners before the Lord exceedingly.</HI> And this may be truly said of all that are in the State of Nature: Tho' they are not all in respect of actual Sins, so wicked as the Men of <HI>Sodom</HI> were, yet they are in respect of the habitual <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and Perverseness of their Nature. Original Sin is greater than all the
<PB N="52" REF="003029_0054_0FEFAF2227AB3660"/>
actual Abominations that were committed in <HI>Sodom. Sodom</HI> was a <HI>Sink,</HI> but corrupt Nature is a <HI>Foun∣tain</HI> of moral Defilements: And there is more filthy Water in this Fountain, than ever issued forth in the impure streams of <HI>Sodom.</HI> The Fountain did not cast out all it's dirty Waters, even in that so defiled Land. Altho' that People did <HI>draw iniquity with cords of vanity and sin as it were with a rope,</HI> yet they did not draw the Fountain dry. But as the Streams discover what the Fountain is, so the abomi∣nable Wickedness in <HI>Sodom,</HI> sheweth to us what the Corruption of our fallen Nature is. And those who are in the State of Polluted Nature, are in respect thereof more filthy &amp; desperately wicked, than the People of <HI>Sodom,</HI> were in respect of the actual Abominations which prevailed in it. They dwell amidst greater Impurities, than those which were visible, and did openly abound in <HI>Sodom.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is this remarkable difference between <HI>Sodom</HI> and a State of Nature; It was possible for a Man to be Righteous in the former, but it is not so in the latter. Indeed, there were not ten righteous Persons to be found in <HI>Sodom,</HI> when the LORD came down to see whether the People had done altogether according to the Cry that went up to him; yet there was One good Man that lived in it at that time; <HI>Just Lot, vexed,</HI> and so not corrupted, <HI>with the filthy conversation of the wicked there: For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and hearing, vexed his righte∣ous soul from day to day with their unlawful deeds,</HI> 2 Pet. 2.7, 8. It was possible, tho' very difficult for one to live in <HI>Sodom,</HI> and not be infected with the Sins of that Place; but it is impossible for one to abide in the State of Nature, and to be free from the Pol∣lutions of it, Job 15.14. <HI>What is man that he should be clean? and he which is born of a woman, that he should be righteous?</HI> It is impossible for him to be so, till he is born of GOD, and there be a Change of his Heart and State.</P>
<P>IT is true, that many who remain in their natural Condition, do appear righteous in the eye of the World;
<PB N="53" REF="003029_0055_0FEFAF2558D617E0"/>
but they are not so in the sight of GOD: They may be outwardly clean; may wash the out-side of the Cup and Platter, and garnish the Sepulchre with spe∣cious shews of Devotion; but are inwardly defiled, full of all Uncleanness, spiritual Putrefaction, Hypo∣crisy and Iniquity, Luke 16.15. <HI>He said unto them, Ye are they which justifie your selves before men; but God knoweth your hearts: for that which is highly esteemed amongst men, is abomintion in the sight of God.</HI> Further, As all unconverted Sinners are, in respect of the Pollution of their Nature, in spiritual <HI>Sodom,</HI> so many of them may be fitly said to be so, in regard of the actual Defilements which they wal∣low in. The Soil of corrupt Nature yieldeth the Fruits of <HI>Sodom,</HI> Deut. 32.32. <HI>Their vine is of the vine of</HI> Sodom, <HI>and of the fields of</HI> Gomorrah: <HI>their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter.</HI> Such are addressed as Inhabitants of <HI>Sodom</HI> &amp; <HI>Gomor∣rah,</HI> who practis'd the Sins which abounded there, Isa. 1.10. <HI>Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of</HI> Sodom; <HI>give ear unto the law of our God, ye peo∣ple of</HI> Gomorrah. The Rulers and People of <HI>Israel</HI> had made themselves in respect of Sin, like those of <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> therefore the faithful Prophet gave them this Title: They deserved no better. <HI>Rome</HI> is called <HI>Sodom</HI> for it's resembling it in Whordom, and all filthiness both of Flesh and Spirit, Rev. 11.8. <HI>Their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which spiritually is called</HI> Sodom. What Multitudes are there who live in the Practice of the abominable Sins of <HI>Sodom,</HI> Pride, fulness of Bread, (<HI>i. e.</HI> Excess in Meats and Drinks,) abundance of Idleness, Uncharitableness and Oppression? How many, like the People of <HI>Sodom,</HI> give themselves over unto Laciviousness, to work all Uncleanness with greediness? How many declare their Sin as <HI>Sodom,</HI> and hide it not? Their Foreheads are steel'd with Impudence, they boast of their Wickedness, and glory in their Shame. How wretchedly secure are the most in the State of Nature, as the People were in <HI>Sodom?</HI> They are setled on their filthy Lees, quiet &amp; undisturb'd
<PB N="54" REF="003029_0056_0FEFAF26F3176050"/>
in their Sins, giving themselves up wholly to secular Business, and sensual Delights. <HI>As it was in the days of Lot; they did eat, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they builded,</HI> not fearing Destructi∣on till it was brought upon them: <HI>Even so it is also in the days of the Son of Man.</HI></P>
<P>THUS in respect of original Corruption, and actual Abominations, Sinners, wherever they dwell on the face of the Earth, are the people of <HI>Sodom.</HI> In a spiritual sense they live in <HI>Sodom.</HI> GOD may justly say concerning all who are in the State of polluted Na∣ture, as in Jer. 23.14. <HI>They are all of them unto me as</HI> Sodom, <HI>and the Inhabitants thereof as</HI> Gomorrah.</P>
<P N="2">2. ALL unconverted Sinners may be fitly said to be in <HI>Sodom,</HI> in respect of that <HI>Destruction</HI> to which, they are expos'd.</P>
<P>THE State of Nature is like <HI>Sodom,</HI> not only in re∣gard of the <HI>Pollution</HI> but also of the <HI>Punishment</HI> of those who continue in it. GOD'S exemplary Venge∣ance on <HI>Sodom</HI> is mentioned in our Context, ver. 29. <HI>The same day that</HI> Lot <HI>went out of</HI> Sodom, <HI>it rained fire and brimstone from Heaven, and destroyed them all.</HI> Agreable to the Account given of it, Gen. 19. 24, 25. <HI>The Lord rained upon</HI> Sodom <HI>and upon</HI> Go∣morrah, <HI>brimstone and fire from the Lord out of Hea∣ven. And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the inhabitants of the cities.</HI> Now this was Emblematical of the utter Destruction of all those who finally remain in the State of Nature; so the Scriptures inform us, 2 Pet. 2.6. <HI>Turning the cities of</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah <HI>into ashes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto those that after should live ungodly.</HI> The Ruin of the People of <HI>Sodom</HI> sheweth to all who live ungodly, what they must expect, and what their End will cer∣tainly be, if they remain in a State of Nature, <HI>viz. to be burned.</HI> The Fire which consumed the Inhabitants of Sodom, was a Type of Hell-fire, which shall consume all the Adversaries of GOD, Jude v. 7. <HI>Even as</HI> Sodom <HI>and</HI> Gomorrah, <HI>and the cities about them in like man∣ner
<PB N="55" REF="003029_0057_0FEFAF2A8E3ABEF8"/>
giving themselves over to fornication, and going after strange flesh are set forth as an example, suffer∣ing the vengeance of eternal fire.</HI> The Fire which destroyed them is said to be <HI>Eternal,</HI> either because of the still continuing Effects of it, or rather, because it was a Type or Representation of the Fire of Hell, and to those miserable Sodomites the very beginning of it, they being brought by those temporal Flames into everlasting Burnings <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pool</HI>'s Annot.</NOTE>. The terrible Destruction of the Sinners in <HI>Sodom,</HI> by Fire and Brimstone, was a lively Representation of the sad and eternal Ruin of all impenitent Sinners. <HI>Upon the wicked God shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tem∣pest: this shall be the portion 'of their cup. The Heavens and the Earth which are now, by the same Word</HI> which created them, <HI>are kept in store, reser∣ved unto fire, against the day of Judgment, and perdition of ungodly men. — Then shall the King, the righteous Judge, say unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye Cursed, into everlasting fire. And they shall be cast into a lake of fire, burning with brimstone.</HI> Thus, as the Inhabitants of Sodom were all destroyed by Fire and Brimstone, so the Scriptures speak of the final Destruction of all impe∣nitent Sinners, as that which shall be by Fire &amp; Brim∣stone, whether properly or metaphorically, I shall not dispute: But only say, that if we take these Scrip∣tures in a figurative sense, they represent the Pains of the Damned to be at least as exquisite &amp; intolerable, as those which Fire and Brimstone can produce. How did the poor tormented Wretches in <HI>Sodom</HI> run scream∣ing about, when showers of flaming Brimstone came down upon them, and their Bodies were so many blazing Torches! Alas, How then will miserable Sinners roar out, gnash their Teeth, and gnaw their Tongues for Pain and Anguish, when they shall be thrown into the Lake that burns with Fire and Brim∣stone, which is the second Death, far worse than the first! — Now let Sinners in Zion (who are also
<PB N="56" REF="003029_0058_0FEFAF2D02983710"/>
in spiritual Sodom) be afraid, let <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take hold on Hypocrites; for who among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall dwell with the devouring Fire? Who amongst us shall dwell with everlasting Burnings?</P>
<P>THUS we see in what respects the State of Nature may be spiritually called <HI>Sodom.</HI></P>
<P>Obs. II. <HI>THAT the Children of Men are warned to</HI> Flee <HI>out of spiritual</HI> Sodom.</P>
<P><HI>LOT's</HI> Wife, and others in <HI>Sodom,</HI> were fore-warned of the burning Tempest which GOD would rain upon it, and were compassionately advis'd &amp; urg'd to get out of <HI>Sodom,</HI> that they might not be involv'd in it's overthrow. GOD sent Angels from Heaven, to give them notice of the approaching Ruin: yea, the <HI>Messenger of the Covenant</HI> was sent on this Errand. Those Ministers of GOD called upon <HI>Lot,</HI> his Wife and Daughters, to make haste, and get out of the accursed City; And while they lingered in <HI>Sodom,</HI> being; loth to leave their commodious Dwelling, rich Estate, and worldly Conveniencies, the Angels laid hold on their hands, and brought them forth, and set them without the City and charged them to escape for their Lives, and not to stay in all the Plain, but to escape to the Mountain, <HI>Gen.</HI> 19. In like manner the gracious GOD deals with the Children of Men, who are in <HI>spiritual</HI> Sodom. He warns them to get out of the polluted, dangerous Estate of Nature: He sends his Ministers, the <HI>Angels of the Churches,</HI> who cry aloud, and shew unto Sinners their Danger, Duty and In∣terest; calling earnestly upon them to forsake their Sins, and part with all which is inconsistent with the Safety and Salvation of their Souls: yea, the glorious increated Angel doth by the Ministry of the Word come, and warn Sinners to escape out of <HI>mystical Sodom.</HI> 2 Cor. 5.20. <HI>Now then we are Ambassa∣dors for Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray you in Christ's stead, Be ye reconciled to God▪</HI>— By awakning Dispensations of his <HI>Providence,</HI> and strong Convictions of his Spirit, the LORD doth, as it were, lay hold on the hands of lingring Sinners,
<PB N="57" REF="003029_0059_0FEFAF2F4BC8B558"/>
and pull them out of <HI>Sodom;</HI> making them leave off the practice of their gross Abominations, and to use some Endeavours to reform their Lives, and save their Soul.— Thus graciously is the Long-suffering GOD pleas'd to warn those who are in <HI>spiritual</HI> Sodom, to hasten out of it, and flee to the City of Refuge, which he hath appointed and prepared for them, lest they be consumed with his fiery Indignation, which he will pour out on all who remain in the corrupt and ac∣cursed State of Nature. Matth. 3.7. <HI>O Generation of vipers, who hath <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you to flee from the wrath to come?</HI>— When the GOD of Hosts is coming forth in his Judgments against his Enemies, he observes that Law of Arms which he gave the Israelites; which was, to offer Terms of Peace to a City before they assaulted it, Deut. 20.10. <HI>When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then proclaim peace unto it.</HI> So the LORD, who is a <HI>Man of War,</HI> sounds a Parly with the Trumpet of his Word, and monitory Pro∣vidences, before he dischargeth the Cannons of his de∣stroying Judgments: He Summons his Enemies to a Treaty of Peace, <HI>[Prepare to meet thy God O Israel]</HI> before he falls on them with the Artillery of his Ven∣geance. He gives Notice to Sinners of their approach∣ing Ruin, that so by their Repentance they might prevent it, Jer. 18.11. <HI>Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways, and your doings good — Hear now the word of the Lord, ye men of</HI> Sodom; <HI>Give ear, Ye people of</HI> Gomorrah, all that are in the pollu∣ted dangerous Estate of Nature: — <HI>Wash ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, cease to do evil, learn to do well— Come now and let us reason together, saith the Lord: Tho' your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; tho' they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land: But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured — O Earth, Earth, Earth, hear the word of the Lord:</HI> O <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>less, stupid Sinners,
<PB N="58" REF="003029_0060_0FEFAF30DE82A758"/>
who mind earthly things, ye are again and again warned and intreated, to get out of <HI>spiritual</HI> Sodom, lest Fire and Brimstone be rained upon you. Zech. 2.6. <HI>Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the North, saith the Lord.</HI> Ye are now earnestly called upon, to come forth, and flee from the Land of the South, as well as from the Land of the North — from mystical <HI>Sodom,</HI> as well as <HI>Babylon.</HI> Will you still linger, when the Clouds of GOD'S Displeasure are visibly hanging over our Heads, ready to burst with Thunder and Lightning; and the Earth under us is sensibly heaving to vomit out Fire and Brim∣stone, to consume us? O Sinners, make haste, delay no longer to get out of the State of Nature, and to keep GOD'S Commandments.—Escape for your Lives, — the Lives of your precious Souls.— Escape to the Mountain, the Mountain of the LORD'S House:— Flee to CHRIST for Refuge.— Flee as Men pursued with the greatest Danger.— Flee with all possible speed — Yea, <HI>Flee like as they fled from before the Earthquake, in the days of</HI> Uzziah <HI>King of Judah.</HI></P>
<P>LET me not seem to any of you, as <HI>Lot</HI> did to his <HI>Sons in Law,</HI> even <HI>as one that mocked.</HI></P>
<P>Obs. III. <HI>THAT in their flight from spiritual</HI> Sodom, <HI>Persons are apt to</HI> look back.</P>
<P><HI>LOT's</HI> Wife was brought without the City, and she fled with him and her Daughters a while toward <HI>Zoar,</HI> and was in a fair way to escape the Ruin, which was then coming on the People of <HI>Sodom;</HI> But she slacken'd her Pace, linger'd behind, and looked back. This Sin of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife is imitated by many in their flight from <HI>spiritual</HI> Sodom: They are so far awaken'd and wro't upon, that they abandon their vicious Practices, and seem to be brought out of the State of polluted Nature; they turn their backs upon <HI>Sodom,</HI> and set their faces towards <HI>Zion,</HI> and are in a fair way to escape the wrath of GOD: they run well for a time; take considerable Pains in Religion, strive to enter in at the strait Gate of Repentance &amp; Faith, labour to get
<PB N="59" REF="003029_0061_0FEF96F8714BDB98"/>
into CHRIST: perform holy Duties with much serious∣ness, and apply themselves to the Work of their Sal∣vation with fear and trembling; and they are <HI>not far from the Kingdom of GOD:</HI> But they do not <HI>hold on,</HI> their Heat is soon spent, and they flag: Their dread of GOD'S Wrath, and concern for their Souls abate; good Impressions wear off; and they meeting with Difficulties in the way of Salvation, grow weary of the Christian Race, stand still, and <HI>look back</HI> —. They are tempted to think, there is no need of so much Care about their Souls, that they were in no such Danger as they apprehended them to be; that the Fire &amp; Brimstone which they were told of, and affrighted with, will not be rained upon them: The Love of the World and the things of it, revives in them; and they fancy it was never better with them, than when they were quiet and undisturb'd in the Enjoyment of their outward Comforts, and sensual Delights; and so thro' Unbelief, and Love of this World, they (as <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife did) <HI>look back</HI> with De∣sires of returning to their former Pleasures. The State of spiritual Pollution and Bondage appears not so bad to them, as when they were first awaken'd to get out of it; nay, better than that of Holiness, which they have been striving to get into: As the <HI>Israelites,</HI> in their Journey to <HI>Canaan,</HI> thought that it was better with them in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and <HI>said one to another; let us make us a captain, and let us return into Egypt,</HI> Numb. 14.4. — They who seem to have escaped out of <HI>spiritual</HI> Sodom, and to have made considerable Progress toward <HI>Zion,</HI> do not ordinarily go back at once, but by degrees. They first <HI>look back;</HI> they grow weary of Prayer, and other Duties, are less fre∣quent and fervent therein: <HI>They say, Behold, what a weariness is it? and they bring the torn, the lame and sick for an offering to the Lord;</HI> Their Minds hanker after their former Company and Delights: Temptations increase upon them daily, and they are more and more inclin'd to resume their abandon'd Lusts, and to renew their fellowship with the unfruitful Works of darkness. Having thus <HI>looked back,</HI> they
<PB N="60" REF="003029_0062_0FEFAF3663E3CE20"/>
commonly (unless prevented by sudden Destruction) go back to <HI>Sodom;</HI> revert to their old Abominations. Prov. 26.11. <HI>As a Dog returneth to his vomit, so a Fool returneth to his folly.</HI> This is cited by the <HI>Apostle,</HI> and apply'd to the Apostates in his time, [O that it were not verified in many of us!] 2 Pet. 2.22. <HI>It is happened unto them according to the true Proverb, The Dog is turned to his own vomit, and the Sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire.</HI></P>
<P>Obs. IV. <HI>AWAKNED Sinners, in their flight from spiritual</HI> Sodom, <HI>should</HI> remember Lot's Wife, <HI>that so they may be deter'd from</HI> looking back.</P>
<P>PERSONS may imitate the Sin, and incur the Punish∣ment of <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife, tho' they do not attempt an Escape out of mystical <HI>Sodom:</HI> may be guilty of Disobedience, Contempt of GOD'S All-seeing Eye, of Unbelief, Covetousness and Ingratitude for the Mercy of GOD in offering to save them from the flames of Hell; and thereby may expose themselves to sudden and shame∣ful Destruction: But such as have begun their flight from <HI>spiritual</HI> Sodom, (as I hope, some here present have,) if they look back, they especially do imitate <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wives Sin, and may expect as terrible a Punish∣ment as Her's: It is therefore peculiarly seasonable, and may be very profitable for those who are endea∣vouring to get out of <HI>spiritual</HI> Sodom, are sollicitously <HI>asking the way to Zion, with their faces thitherwards,</HI> and are flying from Wrath to come, to <HI>remember Lot's Wife. Look not behind</HI> you, lest ye be consumed— Will it not be as great a Sin in you, to <HI>look back,</HI> as it was in <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife? And may you not well be afraid of as great a Judgment, as that inflicted on her? If you <HI>look back,</HI> ye may become <HI>Pillars of Salt,</HI> Mo∣numents of GOD'S severe Justice, Spectacles of Shame and everlasting Reproach. If GOD doth not immedi∣ately consume you, he may righteously smite you with Judicial Hardness; seal you up to Ruin by final Ob∣duration, letting you stand a few Years more in this World, only as occasions to glorify his Power &amp; Wrath
<PB N="61" REF="003029_0063_0FEFAF3AD906E7F8"/>
upon you in the next. <HI>Theophilact</HI> saith, <HI>Lot</HI>'s Wife remain'd obstinate and impenitent, and her Heatt was hardned, and that this is the meaning of her being turned into a Pillar of Salt: Altho' his Interpretation of the Text is not to be embrac'd, yet it may be im∣prov'd by those who are in their flight from <HI>spiritual</HI> Sodom, to deter them from looking back, lest in his sense they become Pillars of hardned Salt.</P>
<P>Zeph. 1.6. <HI>I will stretch out my hand, and cut off them that are turned back.</HI> In the days of <HI>Josiah,</HI> wherein this Threatning was denounced, the sinful People of <HI>Judah</HI> were greatly awaken'd, &amp; outwardly Reformed: But they soon revolted: Many that began well, set out with Zeal in the good ways of the Lord, <HI>turned and looked back:</HI> GOD threatned them parti∣cularly, that he would stretch out his hand, and cut them off, wou'd be quick and severe upon them. — Remember the words of CHRIST, Luk. 9.62. <HI>No man having put his hand to the plough, and looking back, is fit for the Kingdom of God.</HI> Go through with the work that ye have begun, or ye shall never enter into the <HI>Kingdom of God.</HI> Oh! Consider the Dan∣ger and Mischief of <HI>looking back.</HI> If ye return to your former Abominations, the unclean Spirit will have a stronger Possession of you, than he had before, Matth. 12.43, 44, 45. <HI>When the unclean Spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh thro' dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none. Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out, and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished. Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other Spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last State of that man is worse than the first.</HI> This is well Expounded by the Apostle, 2 Pet. 2.20, 21. <HI>For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world, thro' the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again in∣tangled therein, and overcome; the latter end is worse with them than the beginning. For it had been bet∣ter for them not to have known the way of Righteous∣ness,
<PB N="62" REF="003029_0064_0FEFAF3E9640AF90"/>
than after they have known it, to turn from the holy Commandment delivered unto them.</HI></P>
<P>IF ye should be intangled again in your Lusts, and return to the Mire of your Sinful Pollutions, your Escape, if ever it be attempted by you, will be far more difficult than it was at first; your Deliverance out of Spiritual <HI>Sodom,</HI> will be almost despaired of.— Ye having begun in the Spirit, be not so foolish as to end in the flesh. — If any of you have slacken'd your pace, and are turning and drawing back, be convinc'd of your folly and danger, and quickned in your flight to CHRIST, by what ye now hear, — Gal. 5.7. <HI>Ye did run well, who did hinder you, that you should not obey the truth?</HI> — Renew your Resolutions against Sin, and for Holiness and Heaven: Lay aside every weight, and the Sin that doth so easily beset you, and run with patience and perseve∣rence the Race set before you: — and as ye run, <HI>Remember Lot's Wife.</HI></P>
<P><HI>IN fine,</HI></P>
<P>LET such as are really brought forth out of spiri∣tual <HI>Sodom,</HI> and <HI>have fled for Refuge to lay hold on the Hope set before them, Remember Lot's Wife,</HI> to deter them also from looking back. Indeed, those who are escaped out of mystical <HI>Sodom,</HI> ought to look back thereon, with an admiring Eye at the infinite Mercy of GOD, in plucking them as <HI>Brands out of the Fire.</HI> They shou'd reflect on their former polluted and miserable Estate, to excite their Thank∣fulness unto GOD for delivering them out of it; laying hold on their hearts by his omnipotent Grace, when they lingred in spiritual <HI>Sodom,</HI> and effectually bringing them out of it. There is a looking back, which may serve to abase them, and exalt divine Grace, Isai. 51.1. <HI>Hearken to me, ye that follow af∣ter Righteousness, ye that seek the Lord: look unto the Rock whence ye are hewen, and to the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.</HI> But they must not

look back on spiritual Sodom with any Regret for their leaving it, nor desire of returning to it. — They are not, it's true, of <HI>them who draw back unto Per∣dition,</HI> Heb. 10.39. GOD'S electing Love, Cove∣nant-faithfulness, almighty Power, and CHRIST'S continual Intercession shall prevent the total Defection of the Saints. But they are prone to look back, and to go back also a considerable way toward <HI>Sodom.</HI> Declensions are very common among the sincere People of GOD. They frequently slacken their Pace in the good ways of the LORD; grow Cold in Re∣ligion, remiss in holy Duties, do abate much of their Zeal for GOD, and back-slide into many Sins. Altho' they shall not draw back unto eternal Perdition; yet they may to their spiritual Loss, and temporal De∣struction: They may provoke GOD to inflict such Judgments on them, as to make them Monuments of his righteous displeasure against the Sin of <HI>looking back.</HI> Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> saith, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Theol. ref. v. <HI>1.</HI> p. <HI>257.</HI></NOTE> That it is not improba∣ble that <HI>Lot's</HI> Wife, who was turn'd into a Pillar of Salt, was saved notwithstanding this Judgment sent upon her by GOD. We have (saith he) no ill Cha∣racter of this Woman in the Scripture: [he might as truly have said, that we have no good one:] we cannot (saith he) gather from any thing that is said in the sacred History that she had been a wicked Per∣son: [neither can we that she had been a righteous Person:] But this we know, saith he, that she was the Consort of a pious Saint, and beloved of GOD: [we also know that a wicked Woman is sometimes the Wife of a godly Man:] And we know, saith he, that she was mercifully deliver'd out of <HI>Sodom,</HI> as well as her Husband: [so might <HI>Lot's</HI> Sons in Law have been, had they not laugh'd at the warning gi∣ven them.] Tho' I perceive not the strength of those Reasons which the <HI>Doctor</HI> gives, why it is not improbable that <HI>Lot's</HI> Wife was a good Woman, yet I am dispos'd to be of the most Charitable Opinion, if there are as probable Grounds to support it as the

contrary. And if she was a good Woman, the Pun∣ishment inflicted on her may the more deter the Saints from looking back: for it sheweth how the Jealous GOD resents this Sin in his own Children.— Let them remember <HI>Lot's</HI> Wife, and not imitate her Sin, but <HI>Paul's</HI> Example; Phil. 3.13, 14. <HI>Brethren, I count not my self to have apprehended, but this one thing I do, forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are be∣fore; I press toward the mark, for the Prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</HI> — Let them remember <HI>Lot's</HI> Wife, that so they may resist and vanquish all Temptations to Apostacy: and if they do so, they shall become glorious <HI>Pillars</HI> in the hea∣venly Temple, bearing the most honourable Inscrip∣tion; Rev. 3.12, 13. <HI>Him that overcometh, will I make a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of Heaven from my God; and I will write upon him my new Name.</HI></P>
<P>HE THAT HATH AN EAR, LET HIM HEAR WHAT THE SPIRIT SAITH UNTO THE CHURCHES.</P>
<P>THUS I thought it meet to stir you up, by putting you in Remembrance of <HI>Lot's</HI> Wife. And if you are Careful to improve what hath been said, You shall find that <HI>that Pillar of Salt</HI> hath not to this day lost it's Savour; but that your Hearts are seasoned thereby with such Caution, and holy fear, as will be of un∣speakable &amp; eternal Advantage to you: Wherefore, Be not forgetful Hearers, but Remember <HI>Lot's</HI> Wife.</P>
