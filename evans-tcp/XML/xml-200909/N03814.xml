<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>PSALM CIV. 31.</HI></BIBL>
<P>THE Glory of the <HI>LORD</HI> shall endure forever, the <HI>LORD</HI> shall rejoice in his Works.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Glory of the LORD in his Works of Creation and Provi∣dence, but more especially the latter, is the Subject of this high and lofty <HI>Psalm.</HI> The <HI>Style</HI> and Strain of it perfectly agrees to the stately Subject. "It is a noble <HI>Poem,</HI> esteem'd by very competent Judges, far to excel all that the Wit and Devotion of Man has ever wrote upon the <HI>Dominion</HI> of GOD manifest in the Works of Nature;
<PB N="6" REF="004695_0005_100DBADBD2AC6540"/>
if we only consider it in the Brightness of Ideas and Ornaments of Diction."
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">HENRY's <HI>Expos.</HI></NOTE> It begins with giving <HI>Glory</HI> in the highest; <HI>O</HI> LORD <HI>my</HI> GOD, <HI>thou art very Great, thou art clothed with Honour and Majesty; who coverest thy self with Light as with a Garment!</HI> And it draws to a close with my Text, "<HI>The Glory of the</HI> LORD <HI>shall endure forever, the</HI> LORD <HI>shall rejoice in his Works.</HI></P>
<P>Or it may be read as a <HI>Prayer,</HI> the <HI>Hebrew</HI> being in the Imperative <HI>Mood, Let</HI> the Glory of the LORD endure forever; <HI>Let the Lord rejoice in his Works.</HI> q. d. "<HI>Amen,</HI> O LORD most great and gracious! It <HI>is</HI> so, it <HI>will</HI> be so, and ever <HI>may</HI> it be! <HI>Let</HI> the whole Earth ever give thee Glory.</P>
<P>Every way the Words breathe a most fervent <HI>Dox∣ology,</HI> upon the Contemplation and Recitation of the glorious Work of GOD thro' the <HI>Universe,</HI> and express a raptrous <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> to Him thereon; "O may the LORD have <HI>Glory</HI> from us, and <HI>Joy</HI> in all his Creatures; and never more be <HI>grieved,</HI> as He once was, that he had <HI>made Man upon the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>But the Words are <HI>more</HI> than a Prayer: They are an <HI>Affirmation</HI> of what ever was, is and shall be: "Thy <HI>Glory</HI> shall endure to Eternity, and thy <HI>Joy</HI> in all thy Works, in thy <HI>own</HI> unchangeable <HI>Complacency</HI> in them, which is infinitely more than all the <HI>Ado∣rations</HI> of Angels and Saints on the Account of 'em, for ever and ever.</P>
<P>It is only the latter Part of the <HI>Text</HI> I shall dis∣course of, and to be sure in a poor and <HI>low</HI> manner, on so <HI>high</HI> a Subject, <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>shall rejoice in his Works.</HI></P>
<P>The Blessedness and Glory here ascrib'd to GOD, is <HI>Joy.</HI> Glory and Blessedness, cannot be without Joy. They are essential to and inseparable from each other:
<PB N="7" REF="004695_0006_100DBADD5A959290"/>And GOD is the <HI>blessed and only Potentate</HI> in this, be∣cause his <HI>Joy</HI> is perfect in <HI>all</HI> his Works. Never did King or Saint come near to this, no not <HI>Solomon</HI> in all his Glory. He wrote <HI>Vanity</HI> of Vanities on his great Works, for he err'd and sinn'd in his doing and using them. GOD's Works are all perfect; <HI>"They are Verity and Judgment, and are done in Truth and Uprightness";</HI> and the King of Glory has a perfect <HI>Joy</HI> in the Perfection of them all; his Works of <HI>Creation, Providence</HI> and <HI>Grace.</HI> A perfect Wisdom, Holiness, Goodness, Munificence, Benediction shines forth in them; so that ineffable, perfect, infinite <HI>Joy</HI> must be the constant Result. It can be no otherwise for ever and ever. It must be <HI>without Variableness or Shadow of Change.</HI> The invariable Cause and Reason must have an invariable Effect. Perfectness is the Cause, Blessedness and Fulness of Joy is the Re∣sult. There can be neither Addition or Diminution.</P>
<P>Altho' my <HI>Text</HI> leads me more particularly to the Consideration of GOD's Works of <HI>Providence,</HI> yet I will say something also of the Work of <HI>Creation</HI> and <HI>Redemption.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. GOD ever had, hath and will have a Divine ineffable <HI>Joy</HI> in his Work of <HI>Creation;</HI> in all and every Part of it.</P>
<P>How <HI>manifold</HI> these are, we may see thro' the <HI>Psalm,</HI> which instances in GOD's making the <HI>Angels,</HI> stretching forth the <HI>Heavens,</HI> laying the Foundation of the <HI>Earth,</HI> covering it with the <HI>Deep,</HI> filling it with <HI>Springs</HI> of Water, clothing it with <HI>Grass</HI> and <HI>Trees,</HI> the Food of the <HI>Cattle,</HI> and the Dwelling of the <HI>Fowl.</HI></P>
<P>At the <HI>Creation</HI> of all these, <HI>Moses</HI> tells us how GOD expressed his divine Joyes; He saw 'em all to be <HI>very good,</HI> perfect in their Kind, and he <HI>blessed</HI> them, rested and instituted the weekly <HI>Sabbath;</HI> a holy perpetual <HI>Rest</HI> to Man: —How could <HI>Compla∣cency</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="004695_0007_100DBAE1058E2268"/>and <HI>Joy</HI> be more expressed? No wonder that all his <HI>Angels sang together,</HI> and all the <HI>Sons of GOD</HI> in one World and other <HI>shouted for Joy.</HI> Job. xxxviii. 7. They saw the <HI>Joy</HI> of GOD in every Thing that was made, and <HI>far</HI> into the Reasons of it. But GOD only comprehends his own Work, and <HI>his</HI> Joy transcends theirs infinitely, as does his Knowledge and Goodness.</P>
<P><HI>Man</HI> was the Joy of his GOD, in the Day of his Creation: <HI>Let us make Man in our Image, after our Likeness, and let him have Dominion.</HI> GOD made an <HI>Eden</HI> for him, put him into the <HI>Garden</HI> of Pleasure, and fill'd him with <HI>Joys</HI> in his holy and happy State. To give <HI>such</HI> a Being, must be an unknown <HI>Joy</HI> to to him that gave it.</P>
<P>When we see but a little into the Works of GOD, O what a <HI>Joy</HI> does it give us? When we consider his <HI>Heavens, the Work of his Fingers, the Moon and Stars which He has created!</HI> When we look down on the springing <HI>Wegetables</HI> in our Fields and Gardens, — "<HI>If GOD so clothe the Grass!</HI> When we <HI>soar</HI> after the Fowl of Heaven, as on the strong Wings of <HI>Eagles,</HI> or view the <HI>goodly Wings of the Peacock</HI> at our Door! When we go down to the <HI>Sea</HI> in Ships, and the <HI>Dol∣phin</HI> or the <HI>Whale</HI> play about us; — <HI>There is that Leviathan!</HI> Or be it the more terrible <HI>Crocodile</HI> near the Shore, with the <HI>Things creeping innumerable both small and great Beasts,</HI> whereof our <HI>Context</HI> sings: How do the Silver <HI>Shoals</HI> glitter on the Hook or in the Net as we draw them up!</P>
<P>When we survey the <HI>Animals</HI> upon the dry <HI>Land,</HI> both tame and wild, meek and fierce, from the <HI>Horse</HI> and <HI>Elephant,</HI> to the <HI>Mouse</HI> and <HI>Worm;</HI> what surprising Pleasures do the Varieties of wondrous Use and Beauty give to our Contemplative and devout Minds!—But yet when we raise our Eye upon <HI>our selves,</HI> and look in one another's <HI>Faces,</HI> and see each others <HI>Souls</HI> in our Eyes and Speech; how GOD has made the <HI>Dust</HI> into Organs of <HI>Sight</HI> and Hearing, our Hands to work,
<PB N="9" REF="004695_0008_100DBAE322D396A0"/>and Tongues <HI>our Glory!</HI> How he has made our Minds and <HI>Souls</HI> to think and know, to admire, love and joy! to <HI>pray</HI> and praise and serve and be happy! to give <HI>Glory</HI> and Honour and Thanks to the Fountain of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, Perfection and Blessedness! — Above all, when we find our Selves <HI>capable</HI> of a Spiritual and Divine <HI>Joy,</HI> in casting our selves before the <HI>Throne,</HI> and uttering the <HI>Songs</HI> of Heaven, from which the <HI>Coelestial</HI> Spirits never rest; <HI>Revel.</HI> iv. 8, 9. <Q>Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty, which was and is and is to come! — Thou art worthy, to receive Glory and Honour and Power; for Thou hast created all Things, and for thy Pleasure they are and were created.</Q></P>
<P>I say, when <HI>we</HI> may at any time feel within our selves, any part of <HI>their</HI> Pleasure and Delight, in <HI>our</HI> Meditations on, and searching into the Things that GOD has made; what must we then conceive of the <HI>Joy of GOD</HI> in his creating them?</P>
<P N="2">II. I proceed to contemplate, in a like, low and brief manner, the infinite and incessant <HI>Joy of GOD</HI> in his <HI>upholding, preserving, supplying</HI> and <HI>governing</HI> all his Creatures. The Joy must be the <HI>same</HI> in GOD's Work of <HI>Providence,</HI> as of Creation; for the same Wisdom, Power and Goodness is glorious for ever in the one and other; and therefore the like Blessedness and Joy results from both.</P>
<P>Has a <HI>Father</HI> Joy (O low Comparison) in <HI>feeding,</HI> instructing, cloathing and ruling his <HI>Family,</HI> with Prudence and Tenderness? Or to rise higher, Has a a <HI>good King</HI> Joy in blessing, and protecting his <HI>King∣dom?</HI> in being as the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Rain</HI> to them, and as the <HI>Breath of their Nostrils:</HI> which are the high and most elegant Representation of the <HI>Oracles</HI> of GOD to us! Yea, has every earthly <HI>Benefactor,</HI> even in the <HI>lowest</HI> Rank of Life, a <HI>superiour</HI> Joy, akin to that of benevolent <HI>Angels,</HI> in shewing the Kindnesses of GOD to their <HI>Fellow Worms;</HI> in distributing to their Wants and Needs, and <HI>making their Hearts to
<PB N="10" REF="004695_0009_100DBAE4C0B0B260"/>sing?</HI> — Then think of the <HI>Immense Joyes</HI> of GOD in his vast <HI>Benefits</HI> to all his Creatures thro' every Moment of their Existance! To fill them with Good and Happiness, according to their various Capacities of receiving from Him! As the <HI>Psalmist</HI> sings of the <HI>Blessedness</HI> of GOD a few Verses before my <HI>Text; 'These all wait upon Thee, that thou mayest give them their Meat in due Season; that thou givest them they gather; thou openest thy Hand, they are filled with Good.</HI></P>
<P>I might go into particulars, if there were any End of them, and speak of the perpetual <HI>Joyes</HI> which the LORD <HI>most High</HI> must necessarily have in the daily and annual Course of the <HI>Sun,</HI> or of the Planets in their Revolutions and Circles about it; whereby Heat and Life, Light, Food and <HI>Joy,</HI> is preserved in them all; and all our <HI>precious Things are put forth,</HI> Grass for the <HI>Cattel,</HI> and Herbs for the service of <HI>Man,</HI> and <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> and <HI>Oil</HI> to make <HI>glad</HI> his Heart and his Face to shine. Nor does the LORD <HI>of all</HI> overlook the <HI>Life</HI> that is most <HI>below ours: "He knows all the Beasts of the Mountains, and the Cattel upon a thousand Hills,</HI> are His! and almost all for <HI>Us,</HI> O <HI>we</HI> of little Observation and Gratitude! — But how <HI>vast</HI> must <HI>His</HI> Satisfaction be, in his vast Provisions for us Daily? "<HI>His Thoughts are very deep,</HI> while the <HI>brutish Man knows not, nor the Fool understands</HI> any of them. It's very well there is here and there found a <HI>Soul</HI> of high Devotion, "<HI>made glad thro' His Work,</HI> and <HI>tri∣umphing</HI> in them; as in <HI>Psalm</HI> xcii; <HI>"Upon an In∣strument of ten Strings, upon the Harp with a solemn Sound; to shew forth his Loving-kindness in the Morn∣ing, and his Faithfulness every Night.</HI> — But whether <HI>we</HI> will call on our <HI>Souls</HI> or no, or <HI>awake up our Glory to sing and give Praise;</HI> yet <HI>GOD has his Joyes</HI> every Moment of Time, as our <HI>Context</HI> teaches us, <Q>while He makes the Clouds <HI>his Chariot</HI> and walks upon the <HI>Wings of the Wind!</HI> while He appoints the <HI>Moon</HI> for Seasons, and the <HI>Sun</HI> knows its going down; while He sets a Bound to the <HI>Deep,</HI> and sends his <HI>Springs</HI> into the Valleys, to give <HI>Drink
<PB N="11" REF="004695_0010_100DBAE65CA52CF8"/>to every Beast;</HI></Q> — He sees 'em <HI>quench their Thirst</HI> with the Pleasure of a common <HI>Owner</HI> of 'em all! He feeds alike the <HI>mute Fish</HI> of the <HI>Sea,</HI> and the <HI>Birds that sing among the Branches,</HI> as joyful as Creatures of the <HI>Air</HI> can be.—If <HI>we</HI> have no religious <HI>Joy</HI> in con∣templating these common Works of Providence; yet <HI>GOD has a Fulness of Joyes</HI> for ever in them. Earth and Sea are <HI>full of his Riches</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neque enim hic vulgaris est Honor, quod DEUS Mundum tam splendido Ornatu in Gratiam nostram instruxit; ut non solum pulchri hujus Theatri simus Spectatores, sed multiplici Bonorum Copia et Varietate, quae in co nobis sunt exposita, fruamur. Cal. <HI>in loc.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>But what then in the <HI>Joy</HI> of GOD in the <HI>Nations of Men!</HI> ver. 23. "<HI>Man goeth forth to his Work, and to his Labour until the Evening.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Man</HI> is his great <HI>Family,</HI> whom the LORD daily feeds; and the <HI>Nations</HI> and their <HI>Food</HI> is but as the <HI>Drop of a Bucket, and the small Dust of the Ballance.</HI></P>
<P>His <HI>Delights</HI> were from <HI>everlasting</HI> in the <HI>Sons</HI> of Men; and he makes his <HI>Sun</HI> to shine and his <HI>Rain</HI> to fall upon the Just and Unjust; and under such <HI>Feet</HI> he yet puts "all Sheep and Oxen, the Beasts of the "Field, the Fowl of the Air, and the Fish of the Sea. For out of the <HI>Inhabitants</HI> of this our Globe He has an <HI>Election</HI> of his Grace, <HI>foreknown</HI> and predestinated to be <HI>His Joy</HI> to eternal Ages. <HI>These</HI> HE has given to his <HI>only-begotten</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> SON, before all Worlds, to be by <HI>Him</HI> brought out of a State of <HI>Sin</HI> and Misery, the woful Fruit of their wicked <HI>Fall</HI> from Him, to hea∣venly Holiness and everlasting Blessedness. — These therefore He seeds and keeps on Earth, with a <HI>peculiar</HI> Love and Delight, as he did his <HI>Enoch, Noah, Abra∣ham, Isaac, Jacob, Job</HI> and others, preserving them to his heavenly Kingdom.</P>

<P><PB N="13" REF="004695_0012_100DBAEB1C1A7540"/>
But this <HI>special Joy</HI> of the LORD in <HI>some of His Works</HI> above others, and in <HI>some</HI> of the Children of Men above others, naturally leads me into the Con∣templation of the LORDs <HI>rejoicing in his Work of Re∣demption.</HI> I come therefore</P>
<P N="3">III. To speak of GOD's <HI>Joy</HI> in our <HI>Redemption,</HI> his wondrous Work of <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Mercy,</HI> relating to our precious and immortal <HI>Souls,</HI> their present Sanctifica∣tion and eternal Glorification. The most distinguish∣ing <HI>Blessings</HI> of Providence do only minister unto <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of Grace, and hereby become <HI>spiritual</HI> and sav∣ing to us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Joy</HI> of GOD is in recovering sinful Man to his original Holiness and Blessedness: "<HI>Have I any Plea∣sure at all that the Sinner should die? saith the Lord GOD: And not that be turn and live.</HI> GOD and his <HI>Angels</HI> rejoice in this; for <HI>there is Joy among the Angels over one Sinner that repenteth:</HI> But the Joy of the immense <HI>Father of Spirits</HI> must of necessity excel in∣finitely the Joys of all his holy Angels on this Ac∣count: Even to <HI>them</HI> also it might be said, altho' these <HI>elder Brethren</HI> know <HI>no</HI> Displicency and Envy, as we read in the Parable, Luke xv. <HI>Son thou art ever with me, and all I have is thine; but this thy Brother was dead and is alive again, he was lost and is found: It is meet that we make merry and be glad.</HI></P>
<P>Known unto GOD are all his Works from Eternity, before the Being of any <HI>Angel</HI> or Spirit! <HI>Conscious</HI> to his own everlasting <HI>Love</HI> to some who should never Sin, and to others whom He would bring to Repen∣tance, he had the Joy of it before all Worlds.

All Things <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> existed in the Eternal Mind, and were seen and enjoyed by Him in his perfect <HI>Idea.</HI> The Eternal FATHER possessed all Things in his Eter∣nal SON; the <HI>Heir</HI> of all, by <HI>whom</HI> He made the Worlds: <Q>was, says he (Prov. viii. 1.) set up from everlasting, from the Beginning, or ever the Earth was; I was daily his Delight, rejoycing always before Him; re∣joicing in the habitable Parts of the Earth, and my Delights were with the Sons of Men.</Q> Whom the FATHER then <HI>foresaw,</HI> he also did <HI>predestinate to be conformed to the Image of his</HI> SON, that he might be the <HI>Firstborn among many Brethren,</HI> Rom viii. 29.

<P>It is in his <HI>Office</HI> of a Redeemer to us, that the <HI>Father</HI> teaches us to behold the <HI>Glory of the Son,</HI> and speaks <HI>his Joy</HI> in Him, Psal. ii. 6. <Q>I have set <HI>my King</HI> upon my holy Hill of <HI>Sion;</HI> I will declare the <HI>Decree,</HI> the LORD said unto <HI>Me,</HI> thou art my Son, this Day have I be∣gotten thee: Ask of me and I will give the <HI>Heathen</HI> for thy Inheritance; and the uttermost Parts of the Earth for thy Possession.</Q> <HI>Isa.</HI> xlii. 1, <Q>Behold my Servant whom I uphold, mine Elect in whom my Heart delighteth; I have put my Spirit upon Him, he shall bring forth Judgment to the Gentiles.</Q> <HI>Matth.</HI> iii. 17.

Look thro' the whole Revelation of JESUS to us, from the Beginning of the <HI>Bible</HI> to the End of it, and see if the <HI>Joy of</HI> GOD in the REDEEMER be not the <HI>Harmony</HI> of Scripture. So the Revelation begins to <HI>Adam</HI> after his Sin and Condemnation: A blessed <HI>Seed of the Woman to break the Serpent's Head.</HI> A SEED the Joy of GOD and of Souls, the Terror and Judge of Devils. <HI>Enoch</HI> prophesied of Him with Joy and Terror; <HI>Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousand of his Saints to execute Judgment upon all;</HI> first in a Flood of <HI>Water</HI> and then of <HI>Fire. Abraham</HI> heard of his Day with <HI>Joy,</HI> and great Reason had he for it in the <HI>Promise</HI> made to him, "<HI>In thy Seed shall all the Na∣tions of the Earth be blessed.</HI> In the Blessing of <HI>Ju∣dah,</HI> CHRIST is declared to be the <HI>Joy</HI> of GOD and of his <HI>Israel; "Judah,</HI> Thou <HI>art he whom thy Bre∣thren shall praise.</HI> So the GOD of <HI>Israel</HI> spake of his CHRIST to <HI>Moses</HI> as his highest <HI>Joy, "A Prophet will I raise up like unto thee, unto</HI> HIM <HI>they shall hearken.</HI> And so to <HI>David</HI> at large, in the lxxxix <HI>Psalm, "I have laid Help upon One that is Mighty, with my holy Oyl have I anointed Him.</HI></P>
<P>In his <HI>Incarnation</HI> he was the <HI>Joy</HI> of Heaven and Earth: Isai. ix. 6. <Q>Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given, and the Government shall be upon his Shoulder; and his Name shall be called Wonderful, Counseller, the mighty God, the ever∣lasting Father, the Prince of Peace. <HI>Luke</HI> ii. 10. I bring you good Tydings of great Joy, which shall be to all People; for unto you is born this Day a SAVIOUR which is CHRIST the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>The REDEEMER in all his <HI>Offices</HI> is the Joy of GOD and Man; "Thou art a PRIEST forever, after the Order of <HI>Melchisedec:</HI> In his <HI>Ministry,</HI> "He shall bring forth Judgment to the Gentiles: In his <HI>Miracles,</HI> "The Lame shall leap as a Hart, and the Tongue of the Dumb shall sing: In his <HI>Sufferings,</HI> "I have glori∣fied thee; and will glorify: In his <HI>Resurrection,</HI> "O Death I will be thy Plague, O Grave I will be thy De∣struction! In his <HI>Ascension,</HI> "GOD is gone up with a
<PB N="16" REF="004695_0015_100DBAF1D15A2B50"/>Shout, the LORD with the Voice of a Trumpet; sing Praises to our King, sing Praises: In his <HI>Exaltation,</HI> "Sit thou at my right Hand until I make thy Ene∣mies thy Footstool: In his <HI>Intercession,</HI> "I know that thou hearest me always: And finally, GOD's Joy in CHRIST is at his Second Coming in Glory; "For the Father loveth the Son, and hath <HI>committed all Judgment</HI> to Him; that all Men should honour the Son even as they honour the Father.—Such is the Joy of GOD in the <HI>Person</HI> of the REDEEMER, thro' his Accomplishment of the <HI>whole</HI> and every Part of our Redemption and Salvation.</P>
<P N="2">2. I have only to add, the Joy of GOD in <HI>his Re∣deemed</HI> and <HI>saved,</HI> for CHRIST's <HI>sake.</HI></P>
<P>They are his <HI>Elect</HI> and therefore his <HI>Joy:</HI> He <HI>chose</HI> 'em before the Foundation of the World, to be made <HI>holy,</HI> having loved them with an <HI>everlasting Love,</HI> and he draws them with <HI>Loving-Kindness.</HI> He has <HI>espoused</HI> them, and <HI>joyes</HI> over them as a <HI>Bridegroom.</HI> GOD has adopted them in CHRIST, put his <HI>Spirit</HI> into them, his <HI>Image</HI> on 'em.— He joyes in his <HI>Grace</HI> in them; in all the Exercise and Fruit of it to his own Glory. His Gifts and <HI>Calling</HI> are without Repentance.— He joyes in their Prayers and Praises, their spiritual Sacrifices, they are a <HI>sweet Savour of Rest</HI> to him. He joyes in their <HI>Pardon</HI> and Justification; "I —, even I am He, that <HI>blotteth out</HI> thy Sins for my own sake. He joyes in their <HI>Access</HI> to Him, <HI>Communion</HI> with him, and <HI>Joy</HI> in him, "Let me <HI>hear</HI> thy Voice, for <HI>sweet</HI> is thy Voice and thy Countenance is comely. He joyes in their <HI>Obedience</HI> to Him, of every <HI>kind,</HI> active and passive, as in <HI>Abel</HI> and <HI>Job,</HI> the <HI>First-Fruit</HI> and the <HI>none-such</HI> from the Earth. He joyes in all his <HI>Dispensations</HI> to his san∣ctified, in all their Comforts and Crosses, when they re∣ceive <HI>Good,</HI> and when <HI>Evil;</HI> his Love and Joy is the <HI>same</HI> in all, and <HI>theirs</HI> ought to be so; "I will chasten him, with the Rod of Men, but my Loving-kindness will I not take away, nor suffer my Faithfulness to fail —. He sends out his <HI>black Horses,</HI> his <HI>dark</HI> Dispensations, and they <HI>quiet his Spirit,</HI> Zech, vi. 8. <HI>He purifies</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="004695_0016_100DBAF48A39FF08"/>his People in the <HI>Furnace,</HI> and sees 'em with Joy come forth as <HI>Gold:</HI> He burns up the Wicked as <HI>Dross, "Ah! I will ease me of my Enemies! Pharaoh</HI> and <HI>Antichrist</HI> are alike <HI>rais'd</HI> up for his own and his Churches <HI>Triumph.</HI> The <HI>Song of Moses</HI> and the <HI>Lamb</HI> are one: "<HI>Great and marvellous are thy Works, Lord God Almighty! just and true thy Wayes, O King of Saints! who shall not glorify Thee!</HI> — And to con∣clude, The <HI>Consummation</HI> of all Things, when the <HI>Mystery of GOD is finished,</HI> will be <HI>consummate Joy.</HI> both on the part of the FATHER and of CHRIST and of the <HI>Church:</HI> Revel. xvi. 2. <HI>And I saw the New Jerusalem coming down from GOD out of Heaven, as a Bride adorned for her Husband.</HI></P>
<P>So I have meditated in the easiest, plainest, most Scriptural and <HI>Evangelical</HI> manner, and in the most general and comprehensive I could, "<HI>The LORD's rejoicing in his Works.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Use</HI> remains, and <HI>first,</HI> See the <HI>Blessedness, Per∣fection,</HI> and <HI>Glory</HI> of the LORD OUR GOD, and how He is to be <HI>admir'd, blessed</HI> and <HI>magnified</HI> by us, for what He is <HI>in Himself.</HI> He is the <HI>Blessed GOD!</HI> how Grand and glorious is <HI>this</HI> Ascription! His JOY in all his Works is <HI>infinite.</HI> This is worthy of the CREATOR and <HI>Governour</HI> of all Worlds, and the Re∣deemer and Sanctifier of the Saved out of ours. How <HI>happy</HI> must HE be, who is the Fountain of Be∣ing and Felicity in all Worlds! Psal. lxxii. 19. <HI>And blessed be his glorious Name for ever, and let the whole Earth be filled with his Glory! Amen and Amen.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Perfection</HI> of all the <HI>Works</HI> of GOD is a necessary <HI>Inference</HI> from his <HI>rejoicing</HI> in them. If his whole Work were not perfect, how should HE that is perfect rejoice in it? They must be all done in perfect Truth, Wisdom, Goodness, Holiness. They must be as He <HI>Himself</HI> is. If He were not <HI>absolutely perfect,</HI> he could have <HI>no Joy</HI> in Himself; if his Works were not all <HI>so,</HI> he could have <HI>none</HI> in them. "<HI>He covers himself with Light as with a Garment,
<PB N="18" REF="004695_0017_100DBAF759549E80"/>and layes the Beams</HI> of his mighty Building,—and a <HI>Universe</HI> appears. "<HI>His Work is honourable and glo∣rious, and his Righteousness endureth for ever. They are Verity and Judgment and stand fast for ever and ever.</HI> He has made 'em to be <HI>remember'd,</HI> he has ordained e∣verlasting <HI>Memorials</HI> of them to us, in his <HI>Sabbath</HI> and the <HI>Holy Supper. He sent Redemption to his Peo∣ple, he has commanded his Covenant for ever; holy and reverend is his Name.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Let us learn our <HI>Duty,</HI> in Conformity to the Blessed GOD, and for his Glory from us, and for our <HI>own</HI> Joy and Blessedness here and for ever; to <HI>rejoice</HI> in GOD and in the Knowledge we have of his <HI>Works</HI> of Nature, Providence and Grace.</P>
<P>We have Minds and Eyes to observe 'em, and Memories to retain 'em. "<HI>Sought out they are by all that have Pleasure in them;</HI> and he that has it <HI>not,</HI> is worse than blind and brutish "<HI>Understand ye brutish among the People, and ye Fools when will ye be wise?</HI> To whom shall I send them for Instruction and Cor∣rection! let it be to a <HI>holy Woman,</HI> an inspired <HI>Mo∣ther</HI> in <HI>Israel,</HI> to <HI>Hannah</HI> the Mother of <HI>Samuel,</HI> 1. Sam. ii, r. <HI>And Hannah prayed and said, "My Heart rejoiceth in the</HI> LORD, <HI>my Horn is exalted in the</HI> LORD. <HI>I rejoice in his Salvation; there is none holy as the</HI> LORD, <HI>there is none beside him.</HI></P>
<P>A religious Joy in GOD is a most <HI>high</HI> and important Thing in his holy <HI>Law</HI> to us, but how hard is it to attain this Divine Life. Phil. iv. 4. <HI>Rejoice in the</HI> LORD <HI>always, and again I say rejoice.</HI> Man was made for this Joy and in it, and had he preserv'd his Innocence and Holiness, this had been the Light and Life of his Spirit: As it is the Image of GOD on the Spirits in Glory, that they are <HI>holy</HI> and <HI>joyful</HI> like him. It is the most natural <HI>Resolve</HI> in the World, that the <HI>Psalmist</HI> comes into, upon uttering the Words of my Text; "<HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>shall rejoice in his Works;</HI> and <Q>I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live; I will sing Praise unto my GOD while I have my Being; my Me∣ditation
<PB N="19" REF="004695_0018_100DBAF919392358"/>of him shall be sweet;</Q> I will be glad in the LORD

<P>But as the <HI>Joy of GOD</HI> is more especially in the great Work of our <HI>Redemption</HI> and in <HI>his</HI> Redeemed; so let our Joy be in CHRIST JESUS, the Joy of <HI>his</HI> Redee∣med; and in <HI>them</HI> that are so, the <HI>excellent Ones of the Earth, in whom should be all our Delight.</HI> Let us rejoice in his holy <HI>Law</HI> and holy <HI>Worship</HI> and Worshippers; in holy Devotedness and Obedience to Him who has <HI>died for us and rose again;</HI> in the Exercise of Faith and Love, Repentance, Prayer and Praise. Let CHRIST be our <HI>Glory</HI> and <HI>Joy;</HI> He and his <HI>Righteousness,</HI> He and his <HI>People,</HI> He and his <HI>Cross,</HI> He and <HI>his Salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Let the <HI>Use</HI> be of <HI>Shame</HI> and Confusion to us, of <HI>Humiliation,</HI> Repentance and holy Mourning, that we know no more of this <HI>sacred Pleasure,</HI> a holy <HI>Joy</HI> in GOD and his <HI>Works;</HI> that we have no more contem∣plated and <HI>seen</HI> GOD in 'em! that GOD and his <HI>Works</HI> are <HI>not in all our Thoughts!</HI> that we are so <HI>lost</HI> in Sense, and tho'tless of GOD in every Thing we see and feel and hear and taste! that our <HI>Phyloso∣phy</HI> and <HI>Theology</HI> are so poor and low! that we are sunk so much below <HI>Men</HI> as well as <HI>Christians!</HI> stupid and <HI>mindless</HI> of these Works of <HI>Providence</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> which should exceedingly <HI>affect</HI> us and excite our <HI>Gratitude</HI> and Praise! and again at times (it may be) <HI>grieved</HI> at his Works, discontented, offended and <HI>fretful</HI> at them, like <HI>Jonah!</HI> or <HI>envious</HI> as <HI>Asaph, "I was as a Beast before Thee!</HI> and <HI>worse,</HI> for the Beasts <HI>envy not.</HI></P>
<P>Let us remember our <HI>Faults</HI> this Day;—that un∣der some of GOD's holy and righteous Works Us∣ward we have been <HI>dejected,</HI> cast down and ready to despond! that we have been unresigned and <HI>impatient,</HI> or no more <HI>submissive</HI> to the Will of our <HI>Heavenly
<PB N="20" REF="004695_0019_100DBAFB0655E708"/>Father!</HI> or that we have been no more <HI>obedient</HI> and <HI>fruitful</HI> under Divine <HI>Corrections</HI> and Rebukes! that we have <HI>despised</HI> the LORD's Chastning, or <HI>fainted!</HI> that we have been no more <HI>humbled,</HI> purged, purified and <HI>refined</HI> by them! — So GOD has not the <HI>Joy</HI> of his Work, but has been grieved and justly pro∣voked by us! as he was by the <HI>Sinners of the old World,</HI> and it <HI>repented him that he had made Man upon the Earth, and it grieved him at the Heart, and he destroyed the Work of his Hand.</HI> Gen. vi. 6.</P>
<P>But to <HI>close</HI> with a more <HI>pleasurable Direction</HI> and <HI>Exhortation,</HI> which yet may seem somewhat <HI>strange</HI> too; that we should <HI>need</HI> to be so <HI>exhorted.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Let GOD have Joy in Us among his other Works.</HI> He will have <HI>none</HI> in us without our own Consent and Will, he will <HI>joy</HI> in the Triumphs of his <HI>Justice</HI> on us, if we <HI>will not</HI> be to the Triumph of his <HI>Grace</HI> and Mercy. <HI>If thou be righteous what givest thou to Him? And if thou sinnest what dost thou against him?</HI> — We are a Part of the Work of his Hands, and he <HI>expects</HI> Joy from us, and has made us for a <HI>voluntary</HI> yielding it to him. This is the <HI>Prerogative of Man</HI> above the inseriour Creatures; He must joy in GOD, that GOD may joy in Him.— With Joy also has GOD <HI>redeemed</HI> us, that he might <HI>rejoice</HI> in us, as renewed, sanctified, justified and glorified. O let him have <HI>this Joy</HI> in our Rege∣neration, Adoption, Justification and eternal Salvati∣on. Let Him have <HI>Joy</HI> in our Love, Adoration, Ser∣vice and Obedience; in our Submissions, Prayers and Thanksgivings for ever and ever. — Let us <HI>devote</HI> our selves to Him as <HI>living Sacrifices, holy and accep∣table thro'</HI> JESUS CHRIST <HI>our</HI> LORD. Let us <HI>walk</HI> be∣fore Him in all holy <HI>Obedience,</HI> that He may dwell with us and in us, and be our GOD. Let his <HI>Name</HI> be hallow'd by us, and his <HI>Kingdom</HI> come in us, and his <HI>Will</HI> be done by us, as it is done in Heaven. <HI>Why</HI> should not GOD have Joy in <HI>Us,</HI> as he has in his <HI>holy Ones</HI> above, thro' the Ages of <HI>Eternity!</HI> Let us yield Him the Obedience of <HI>Faith</HI> here, and of <HI>Love and Joy</HI> for ever. The <HI>Kingdom</HI> of GOD here <HI>in us,</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="004695_0020_100DBAFDF5C73A28"/>and that to come hereafter, is <HI>Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the</HI> HOLY GHOST. This is approved of GOD and accepted by him; this is the <HI>Joy of the</HI> LORD — But then we must <HI>deprecate Sinners</HI> and their Ways, and <HI>imprecate</HI> against them, for GOD can have <HI>no Joy</HI> in them, nor in his <HI>Earth</HI> because of them. So there∣fore the <HI>Psalm</HI> concludes; "<HI>Let the Sinners be con∣sumed out of the Earth, and let the Wicked be no more; bless thou the</HI> LORD <HI>O my Soul, praise ye the</HI> LORD. The Meaning is, The holy GOD can never rejoice in <HI>Us,</HI> nor in his <HI>Works</HI> on Earth, while <HI>we</HI> and <HI>they</HI> are involv'd in <HI>Sin;</HI> but were <HI>Sin</HI> once <HI>consumed</HI> out of the Earth which is the very <HI>End</HI> and Effect of our <HI>Re∣demption</HI> by CHRIST; then GOD has Pleasure in be∣holding this his Earth and dwelling in it, and then we with holy Joyes and Exultation can <HI>laud</HI> and praise and bless him. Else "<HI>He looks on the Earth, and it trembles, he touches the Hills and they smoke:</HI> His fiery Presence sets it in a <HI>Flame;</HI> which are the very Words following my <HI>Text</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ostendit statum Mundi in illu DEI Laetitia fundatum esse, quia nisi Terram vegetet sereno paterno que affectu, simul ac eam severo oculo adspexerit, tremefaciet, Montes{que} ipsos ex uret.</NOTE></P>
<P>Let this therefore be our holy <HI>Ambition,</HI> our humble <HI>Prayer</HI> and sollicitous <HI>Care,</HI> that GOD and his <HI>Earth</HI> may have Joy in us and from us in our respective Places.</P>
<P>Let MAGISTRATES therefore <HI>rule for GOD,</HI> as they do by Him and under Him; and <HI>say unto the Fools, deal not so foolishly, and unto the Wicked, lift not up the Horn on high, speak not with a stiff Neck.</HI> Let 'em resolve by the Grace of GOD and say with <HI>David,</HI> <Q>I will behave my self wisely in a perfect Way, I will walk in my House with a perfect Heart; I will set no evil Thing before my Eyes, a froward Heart shall depart from me, I will not know a wicked Per∣son; my Eyes shall be upon the Faithful in the Land, that they may serve me.</Q></P>

Then if the <HI>Vine be advanced to rule over the Trees,</HI> it shall be so far from <HI>losing it's Sweetness,</HI> that it will but the more abundantly <HI>diffuse</HI> it's generous Spirit, and <HI>chear the Heart both of GOD and Man:</HI> As <HI>Jotham</HI> spake in his <HI>Parable</HI> by the Wisdom of GOD. But <HI>wise</HI> was the <HI>Vine</HI> to <HI>refuse</HI> the Rule, if it must thereby <HI>lose</HI> it's Sweetness, turn <HI>sour</HI> and <HI>grieve</HI> both GOD and Man; as <HI>Saul</HI> did, and the LORD said to <HI>Samuel, "It repenteth me that I made him King.</HI></P>
<P>But as this Matter pertaineth to <HI>Rulers,</HI> that the LORD <HI>may rejoice in his Work;</HI> so also does it to the <HI>whole Body</HI> of a People, <HI>Ministers</HI> and private <HI>Christians,</HI> in a reverend and delightful <HI>Concurrence</HI> with Them; as <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Hur</HI> held up the Hands of <HI>Moses</HI> in the Mount; and as <HI>Shechaniah</HI> answer'd and said unto <HI>Ezra; — "We also will be with Thee; be of good Courage and do it.</HI></P>
<P>How beauteous, healthy and <HI>Athletic</HI> then is the <HI>Body?</HI> the <HI>Head</HI> and all the Members together having the same Regard to GOD and Care one for another; that the LORD (whose we are, and whom we serve to∣gether) may take <HI>Pleasure</HI> in us all and <HI>beautify the Meek with Salvation,</HI> his <HI>Israel rejoicing in Him that made him, and the Children of Zion being joyful in their King.</HI></P>
<P>I will give you here an <HI>Instance,</HI> the most <HI>general</HI> and comprehensive, <HI>singular</HI> and proper, in the religious <HI>Ob∣servation of the</HI> LORD's-DAY among a People; it being the <HI>One</HI> primitive and perpetual <HI>Memorial</HI> of the LORD's <HI>rejoicing</HI> in his whole Work of Creation, Providence and Redemption; and the <HI>weekly</HI> sacred Season of <HI>our</HI> joyful remembring GOD in his Works, to give Him the <HI>enduring Glory</HI> of them.</P>
<P>Let <HI>Rulers</HI> and People only unite in the <HI>Sanctifica∣tion of the</HI> SABBATH, <HI>Ministers</HI> leading in the holy pub∣lick Solemnities of <HI>Worship,</HI> and <HI>People</HI> assembling with <HI>Reverence</HI> and godly Fear; <HI>Parents</HI> and Heads of Families commanding their <HI>Children</HI> and Housholds to

<P><HI>Men, Brethren</HI> &amp; <HI>Fathers</HI> hearken! If <HI>we</HI> in our re∣spective Places religiously consult the <HI>Glory of GOD</HI> and it's <HI>enduring</HI> among us, there is no <HI>doubt</HI> at all to be made of GOD's <HI>rejoicing over us to do us good:</HI> <Q>And they that be of Thee shall build the old <HI>waste</HI> Places; Thou shalt raise up the Foundations of past Generations; and be called the <HI>Repairer</HI> of the Breach, the <HI>Restorer</HI> of Paths to dwell in.</Q></P>
<P>But while we are zealous for the <HI>Ordinances</HI> of our GOD, relating to his <HI>Worship,</HI> shall we forget or neg∣lect the <HI>Duties</HI> that respect our <HI>civil</HI> Life and <HI>moral</HI> Conduct one toward another; a sober, a righteous and peaceable Life, <HI>in all Godliness and Honesty?</HI> GOD for∣bid! — Shall we not willingly and <HI>gladly</HI> <Q><HI>submit</HI> to every Ordinance of Man for the LORD's sake? whether it be to the KING in supreme, or unto GOVERNOURS as sent by <HI>Him,</HI> for the Punishment of Evil-doers, and for the Praise of them that do well? — For so it is the Will of GOD that with <HI>well-doing</HI> you put to silence the Ignorance of foolish Men; as <HI>free</HI> and not using your Liberty as a Cloke of Maliciousness, but as the Servants of GOD: Ho∣nour all Men, love the Brotherhood, fear GOD, honour the KING,</Q></P>
<P>So we are taught of GOD, and commanded by Him to <HI>teach</HI> you, <Q>To be subject to <HI>Principalities</HI> and Powers, to obey Magistrates and to be ready unto every good Work.— Let every Soul therefore be
<PB N="24" REF="004695_0023_100DBB05F4F2BBB8"/>to the HIGHER POWERS; for there is no <HI>Power</HI> but of GOD: the POWERS that be are ordained of Him; whosoever therefore resisteth the Power (in it's <HI>law∣ful</HI> Commands) resisteth the <HI>Ordinance</HI> of GOD, and they that resist shall receive to themselves <HI>Damna∣tion:</HI></Q> But be not terrified by <HI>this</HI> Word, as if on Pain of <HI>Damnation</HI> you were obliged to obey <HI>evil</HI> and unlawful Commands; <HI>No;</HI> the righteous and <HI>holy</HI> GOD can never require this of us, nor may his VICEGE∣RENTS on Earth demand it: <Q>For <HI>Rulers</HI> are not a <HI>Terror</HI> to good Works, but to the evil: Wilt thou then be <HI>afraid</HI> of the Power? Do that which is <HI>good</HI> and thou shalt have <HI>Praise</HI> of the same;</Q> (you may most justly expect and demand it.) <Q>For He is the <HI>Minister</HI> of GOD to thee <HI>for Good:</HI> But if thou do that which is <HI>evil</HI> be <HI>afraid;</HI> for He beareth not the <HI>Sword</HI> in vain; He is the Minister of GOD, <HI>a Revenger,</HI> to execute <HI>Wrath</HI> upon him that doeth Evil; (and upon <HI>no</HI> other) wherefore you must needs be <HI>subject,</HI> not only for Wrath but for <HI>Conscience-sake.</HI> For, for this Cause pay you <HI>Tribute</HI> also; for They are GOD's Ministers, <HI>attending</HI> continually upon this very Thing: Render therefore unto all their <HI>Dues,</HI> Tribute to whom Tribute is due; Custom to whom Custom, Fear to whom Fear, Honour to whom Honour: Owe no Man any Thing but to <HI>love one another;</HI> for he that loveth another hath <HI>fulfilled the Law;</HI></Q> scil. of the <HI>second Table,</HI> in all that it pre∣scribes to us in our various <HI>Relations,</HI> in Family, School, Church and State.</P>
<P>So let the <HI>Beauty</HI> of the LORD our GOD be <HI>upon us!</HI> So may He <HI>establish the Work of our Hands!</HI> So may He <HI>satisfy us early with his Mercy,</HI> that we may <HI>rejoice all our Days!</HI> So may He make us <HI>glad,</HI> ac∣cording to the <HI>Days wherein He has afflicted us, and the Years wherein we have seen evil.</HI></P>
<P>So may Your EXCELLENCY, and <HI>We</HI> together, have Reason to <HI>rejoice</HI> for ever in the particular <HI>Work of GOD,</HI> which has bro't you to <HI>worship</HI> with us at this Time; Your Accession to the GOVERNMENT over us.</P>

<P>May <HI>David's</HI> humble Resolution be this Day taken up by your EXCELLENCY, and strictly kept to; "<HI>When I receive the Congregation, I will judge uprightly.</HI> So "<HI>Wisdom and Knowledge shall be the Stability of</HI> your <HI>Times, and Strength of Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>And so the <HI>Glory of the</HI> LORD <HI>shall endure with us,</HI> in the flourishing of pure Religion, and of a righte∣ous <HI>Commerce,</HI> and of <HI>holy Sabbaths,</HI> under your <HI>wise</HI> Counsels and Influence.</P>
<P><HI>Happy</HI> the RULER and <HI>People</HI> together in such a <HI>Case,</HI> for the LORD will be their GOD. And tho' the <HI>Ruler</HI> must <HI>die</HI> like other <HI>Men,</HI> accountable to <HI>his</HI> GOD and ours; yet will be living and dying be justly <HI>own'd</HI> an earthly kind of <HI>God</HI> in this, "That like the GREAT LORD his <HI>Righteous</HI> SOVEREIGN, he shall <HI>rejoice</HI> in hill own <HI>Works</HI> of Righteousness and Goodness, for ever and <HI>ever.</HI></P>

Which GOD of his infinite Mercy grant to YOUR EXCELLENCY, and to all our <HI>Honourable</HI> RULERS, both in the Legislative and Executive Trust; thro' JESUS CHRIST, <HI>to whom be Glory, for ever and ever.</HI> AMEN.</P>
