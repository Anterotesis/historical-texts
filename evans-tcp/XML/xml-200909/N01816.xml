<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P>IT is known to those few in the World, who have any knowledge of so obscure &amp; incon∣siderable a Person as I am, that in my Judg∣ment I am for the <HI>Congregational Church-Dis∣cipline,</HI> as it is in the <HI>New-England Platform</HI> declared. Which is no Abatement unto my great Esteem &amp; Honour, for our Brethren of the <HI>Pres∣byterian</HI> Peswasion; among whom <HI>I</HI> know, there have been as Pious and Learned Persons, not only in <HI>England</HI> &amp; <HI>Scotland,</HI> but also in <HI>Hol∣land, France, Geneva, &amp; Switzerland,</HI> &amp; else∣where, as any whom the World hath known. When the Divine Providence ordered my Residing at <HI>London</HI> for about Four Years, I did my utmost to promote an <HI>UNION</HI> between those of the <HI>Pres∣byterian</HI> &amp; <HI>Congregational</HI> Perswasion; and have received Thanks from the most Eminent of them, for those my Endeavours, which thro' the Blessing of GOD, were not without Success. They have been since known by the Name of, <HI>United Brethren.</HI> But I am far from Approving <HI>Morellianism,</HI> or <HI>Brownism,</HI> or <HI>Independency,</HI> which is disclaimed, not only by our Renowned <HI>Hooker,</HI> but also in our <HI>Platform of Church-Discipline.</HI> My declaring for the <HI>Decisive Power</HI> of <HI>Councils,</HI> is not upon a Notion lately Espoused by me; my Learned Tutor Mr. <HI>Norton,</HI> from whom I received Principles of Truth in my Youth, not to be forgotten in Old Age, has Judi∣ciously handled that Question in his Answer to
<PB REF="002149_0003_0FBCBDDD45C825F8"/><HI>Apollonius,</HI> a Dutch Presbyterian. Dr. <HI>Horn∣beck,</HI> sometimes a famous Professor in <HI>Leyden,</HI> gives the preference to that Book, unto any that he had seen Written in Defence of the <HI>Congre∣gational Discipline.</HI></P>
<P>I advance nothing in the following Papers, but what I have asserted many Years ago; particu∣larly, in, <HI>The First Principles of New-Eng∣land,</HI> Written Fifty Years since; And in my, <HI>Or∣der of the Gospel,</HI> Printed, both in <HI>Boston</HI> and at <HI>London,</HI> Twenty Years since, I handled that Question, <HI>Whether there ought not to be an Agreement, that Matters of Importance,</HI> Par∣ticularly, the <HI>Ordaining,</HI> the <HI>Deposing,</HI> and the <HI>Translating</HI> of a <HI>Pastor,</HI> should be with a <HI>common Consent?</HI> I there shew, that it was so, in the Next Age to the Apostles, and that <HI>Cyprian</HI> assures us, it was so in the Churches of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>It was at the Desire of <HI>My Brethren,</HI> several Ministers in <HI>Boston,</HI> that I set my Name alone to this <HI>Testimony;</HI> in the Composing &amp; Approving whereof, there were more hands than mine. I say, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> and not, <HI>My Sons,</HI> tho' I am the Natural Father to the Eldest of them; and in some Sense a Father to the Two Next Eldest of them, who were my Academical Children, when Students at the College Thirty Years ago. I rejoyce that I have such <HI>Brethren,</HI> and that when I am just going out of the World, I shall Leave Mini∣sters in <HI>Boston,</HI> who, I trust, will defend the Churches, when I shall Sleep with my Fathers.</P>
<P>May our Lord <HI>JESUS CHRIST</HI> walk still in the midst of His Golden Candlesticks, and hold the Stars in His Right Hand, and cause us to Remember whence we are fallen, and to do the First Works.</P>

<HEAD>A Seasonable TESTIMONY To Good Order in the CHURCHES of the Faithful.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>Given by Several Ministers of the Gospel in BOSTON.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT appears a Duty incumbent on us, whom the Hand of the Glorious LORD that is the <HI>King of Zion,</HI> hath Placed as <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Watchmen</HI> of Churches in a <HI>City set upon an Hill,</HI> to Publish unto the World, and leave with the Churches throughout the Country, a <HI>Testimony,</HI> relating to the <HI>Order of the Gospel:</HI> And Expressing; (that so they whom we address, may the more suitably <HI>Receive the Testimony</HI>) the Sentiments of our <HI>Synods,</HI> and of such <HI>Divines</HI> as have been in some Sort <HI>Master-builders</HI> among those by whom our Churches have been <HI>Edified:</HI> whose Thoughts cannot but Challenge a
<PB N="2" REF="002149_0005_0FBCBDDFEB91BF60"/>Great Attention, from those to whom GOD has made them the Instruments of so much Illumination. The Design of our present Action being partly to do a Justice unto the Reputation of Churches, the <HI>Managements</HI> as well as <HI>Ministers</HI> whereof should be <HI>the Glory of CHRIST,</HI> and partly, to make an offer of what may be of some use, to direct their Steps on <HI>recurring Occasions</HI> that may arise of no little Consequence to their Tran∣quillity; we may Comfortably Ask and Hope for the Blessing of Heaven upon it.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> THE first Case that at this Time calls for our Consideration, is, <HI>The Release of a Pastor from the Solemn Charge of a Congrega∣tion, which he has taken upon him.</HI> Upon this there have been once and again Published, some <HI>Determinations,</HI> which have been En∣tertained without Exception in our Chur∣ches; From whence, (without Repeating the Causes of a <HI>Removal</HI> there allowed of) we transcribe these words, as Expressive of what we would have ever to be thought upon. [<HI>Thirty Cases.</HI>]
<Q>A <HI>Pastor</HI> settled in the Service of a <HI>People,</HI> is to be so sensi∣ble of his <HI>Designation</HI> by the Spirit &amp; Pro∣vidence of the Lord JESUS CHRIST for that Service, and of the <HI>Account</HI> that he
<PB N="3" REF="002149_0006_0FBCBDE158562210"/>must give unto GOD about his Behaviour in it, that his <HI>Removal</HI> must not be rashly attempted, but with much Consideration, Consultation, Supplication, and Sincere Desire to follow the Conduct of Heaven in it. The Frowns of GOD use to follow <HI>Re∣moves,</HI> that have not so been Regulated.</Q> <HI>Again</HI>
<Q>That the <HI>will</HI> of our Lord about the <HI>Removal</HI> of any <HI>Pastor</HI> from his <HI>People</HI> may be understood, it is requisite, that the Mi∣nister do not entirely <HI>Assume to himself,</HI> the Judgment of his own Call to Remove, but a Great Regard must be had unto the Di∣rection of the Churches of our Lord, in the Neighbourhood. <HI>Once more.</HI> If much of <HI>Scandal</HI> will certainly ensue upon the <HI>Re∣moval</HI> of a <HI>Pastor</HI> from his People, <HI>That</HI> should weigh down many Circumstances that would rather invite it. <HI>And,</HI> It becomes not any Minister, to <HI>Seek his own Transla∣tion,</HI> by first offering himself unto it.</Q> It is accordingly our Apprehension, that such a <HI>Removal</HI> ought still to be attended, at least with Two Qualifications to Legitimate it, and render it Inoffensive unto the Chur∣ches of GOD.</P>
<P N="1">First. IT is requisite, that the <HI>Reasons</HI> of the <HI>Removal</HI> be laid before <HI>Authentick Judges;</HI> even such as may be most likely to pass an
<PB N="4" REF="002149_0007_0FBCBDE55016A318"/><HI>Impartial Judgment</HI> upon them; and by these be pronounced such, that the <HI>Removal</HI> there∣upon may be Justly &amp; Wisely proceeded in. And, where it can be obtained, we think, that nothing less than a <HI>Council</HI> of Churches in the Neighbourhood, should have the Mat∣ter laid before them. For, if such a <HI>Council,</HI> be according to the <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Practice,</HI> of these Churches, always Convened, for the <HI>Ordaining</HI> of a <HI>Pastor,</HI> it stands to Reason, that there should as much be requisite for his <HI>Removing;</HI> it being, as it was by a very con∣fiderable Number of Eminent Divines on a Great Occasion in these Churches once pro∣nounced, <HI>A very considerable Act of the Kingly Government Exercised by our Lord JESUS CHRIST, in His Churches.</HI> Accordingly, a General <HI>Synod,</HI> in the Year 1662. have de∣termined, That the <HI>Translation of a Pastor,</HI> is a Point, wherein the <HI>Communion of Churches</HI> is to be Exercised; and the chief way of <HI>Communion</HI> there Propounded, is Expressly that of <HI>Councils.</HI> And certainly so Important an Affair will demand such a <HI>Cognisance.</HI> Wherefore, If a Minister be upon a Removal from his Flook, especially when there are no sufficient Causes Evident for it, and the Flock Earnestly Propound and Request, that the thing may be laid before a <HI>Council</HI> of the
<PB N="5" REF="002149_0008_0FBCBDE83128E278"/>Neighbour-Churches, but he refuse it, it may be feared, that it is an <HI>Hour of Tempta∣tion</HI> with him, and that his <HI>Way is not Right</HI> before the LORD.</P>
<P>Secondly. IT is requisite, that the <HI>Rea∣sons</HI> be found such as are Consistent with the <HI>Solemn Vow,</HI> which a Person who receives the <HI>Pastoral Charge</HI> of a Church, makes unto our Glorious LORD, for the <HI>saithful Discharge</HI> of his Ministry, and the <HI>Labour &amp; Patience</HI> of One that must <HI>give up an Account</HI> unto Him; and Consistent with the fervent <HI>Love,</HI> which One that has the <HI>Pastoral Charge</HI> of a Church, ought to bear unto his Flock; <HI>having them in his Heart,</HI> as the Servant of GOD speaks. <HI>To Die and to Live with them.</HI> Very Plain are the Directions of that Word, which they Preach unto others; [Act. XX. 28.] <HI>To have regard unto all the Flock, unto which the Holy Spirit has made them Overseers, &amp; <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> of GOD, which He has purchsed with His own Blood.</HI> And [1 Pet. V. 2.] <HI>To feed the flock of GOD, taking the Oversight thereof, not by Constraint, but willingly, and with a Ready Mind.</HI> And according hereunto, there can be nothing more suitable for them, then that Language; [1 Thes II. 8.] <HI>Being affectio∣nately desirous of you, we were <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>. Imparted unto you, not the Gospel <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="6" REF="002149_0009_0FBCBDE99CE54B08"/>ly, but also our own Souls, because ye were dear unto us.</HI> And, [2 Cor.XII. 5.] <HI>I will very gladly spend, and be spent for you, tho' the more abundantly I love you the less I am loved of you.</HI> Most certainly, No Views that are of a meer <HI>Carnal Tendency,</HI> may operate in such a con∣cern as this, where the flaming Eyes of an Heart-searching LORD, who walks in the Midst of His Churches, will with an Holy Displeasure observe them. Nor may the Churches have <HI>Stumbling-blocks</HI> laid before them, to tempt them unto Hard or Mean Thoughts of the Ministry from whence they Expect the <HI>Word of Truth,</HI> and the <HI>Gospel of their Salvation.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> ANOTHER Case that calls for our Consideration, is; <HI>How the Right of a Particu∣lar Church to Chuse their own Pastor, is to be Exercised.</HI> Now herein we for ever adhere to the Sentiments, which we have some Years ago, declared in these Terms.
<Q>A Body of Christians <HI>Associated</HI> for all the Ordinances of the Gospel, are a CHURCH of our Glo∣rious LORD, which have among other precious Privileges, a <HI>Right</HI> from HIM, <HI>To Chuse their own Pastors.</HI> The Churches which have Recovered this <HI>Right</HI> from <HI>the Oppression of Man,</HI> under which many Chur∣ches
<PB N="7" REF="002149_0010_0FBCBDEDB42A3F80"/>of the Reformation are to this day groaning, ought to <HI>keep the Precepts</HI> and the <HI>Favours</HI> of the Lord, and not easily part with what He has <HI>given them.</HI> NEVER∣THELESS, A Church in the Exercise of this <HI>Right,</HI> ought in all possible ways con∣sistent therewithal, to consult the Edifica∣tion and Satisfaction of their <HI>Neighbours;</HI> Especially those, on whose Assistance to carry on their Affairs, they may have much Dependence. The Church ought so to Manage their <HI>Choice,</HI> that if the Neigh∣bours have any just Dissatisfaction, all the Respect required by <HI>Scripture</HI> and <HI>Reason,</HI> and <HI>Gratitude,</HI> may be paid unto it.</Q></P>
<P>And long before this Instrument, which was given some Years ago, it was declared in the well-known, <HI>Thirty Cases;</HI>
<Q>That a <HI>Particular Church</HI> owing a Great Regard unto the <HI>Church Catholick,</HI> in the using of its own <HI>Right,</HI> is bound to Consult the Sa∣tisfaction and Edification of <HI>Others,</HI> in their <HI>Election</HI> of a <HI>Pastor. And,</HI> That Churches in their <HI>Election</HI> of a <HI>Pastor,</HI> are to consider the Benefit of <HI>All</HI> that are to be his <HI>Hear∣ers,</HI> and more particularly the Concurrence of such, as are by the <HI>Covenant</HI> and Ap∣pointment of GOD, under the <HI>Church-Watch</HI> among them. <HI>And,</HI> That <HI>Churches</HI> may
<PB N="8" REF="002149_0011_0FBCBDF0DCDFF7C0"/>suffer their <HI>Elections</HI> to be <HI>Directed,</HI> yea, and be <HI>Diverted,</HI> by Considerations, which they <HI>owe</HI> to others in the <HI>Vicinity,</HI> without Surrendring their <HI>Liberties</HI> to be Smothe∣red by any that would unjustly Impose thereupon.</Q></P>
<P>UNTO this, we now add our further De∣claration, That a Church may be guilty of doing what is very <HI>Wrong,</HI> if they use the <HI>Right</HI> which they claim, in such a way, as to forget those Indispensable Maxims of our SAVIOUR. [Rom.XIV. 19.] <HI>Let us follow the things that make for Peace, &amp; things wherewith one may edify another.</HI> And, [2 Cor.XII. 26.] <HI>Let all Things be done to Edifying.</HI> And, [1 Pet. V. 5.] <HI>All of you be subject one to another.</HI> And, [Phil. II. 3.] <HI>Let nothing be <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> through strife; but in lowliness of Mind, let <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> other better than themselves.</HI> And therefore, if they be a <HI>Minor</HI> part of the Church, which are earnestly set against the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which a <HI>Major</HI> part shall make of a <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>; but this <HI>Minor</HI> part are considerable by Number, and behave themselves as <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christians,</HI> willing to have their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> determin'd by proper Judges, and have <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a Plea of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> for their <HI>Dissent,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> appears they cannot without Sin, un∣der
<PB N="9" REF="002149_0012_0FBCBDF1E53B47D0"/>their present Apprehensions, Acquiesce in the Choice, and the Consequences of it, the Church ought now to <HI>do nothing Rashly,</HI> but with convenient <HI>Pauses,</HI> and with all due Methods for Satisfaction, <HI>Wait</HI> until it shall please GOD, that the <HI>Dissatisfyed Bre∣thren</HI> shall have no cause to Complain of an <HI>Oppression</HI> upon them; Especially, when the condition of a Church, may be such, that their <HI>Immediate Proceeding</HI> unto a Settlement shall not be absolutely Necessary.</P>
<P N="3">III. A Third Case calling for our Con∣sideration, is, <HI>The Power of Councils, and the Respect which particular Churches and Persons owe unto them.</HI> Now our <HI>Platform</HI> does in Express Terms assert, That <HI>Synods orderly assembled,</HI> are an <HI>Ordinance of CHRIST, and many times necessary to the well-being of Chur∣ches, for the Establishment of Truth and Peace therein.</HI> [ch. 6. §. 1.] And, <HI>That when any Church wants Light or Peace among themselves, Churches ought to meet together by their El∣ders and other Messengers, in a Synod, to con∣sider the Point in Doubt or Difference, and ha∣ving found out the way of Truth and Peace, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> commend the same unto the Churches whom <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may concern.</HI> [ch. 15. §. 2.] And more particularly, <HI>That Neighbour-Churches are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="10" REF="002149_0013_0FBCBDF39C7070F8"/>be advised withal, and their Help used, when</HI> Pastors are <HI>to be tried and chosen.</HI> [ch. 8. §. 8.] And a General Synod of our Chur∣ches, 1662. has directed, <HI>That Churches do seek and accept Help from, and give Help to, each other, in Matters of more than ordinary Importance, as Ordination, Translation, and Deposition of Elders, and such like.</HI> Agreeably to which, the Law of the Colony once re∣quired, the <HI>Approbation of Three or Four Chur∣ches,</HI> to every <HI>Ordination.</HI> And those Di∣vines who have <HI>Seemed to be Pillars</HI> in the Revived <HI>Congregational Discipline</HI> espoused by our Churches, have generally expressed the same concern, that the Usage &amp; Honour of Ecclesiastical <HI>Councils,</HI> might be Maintai∣ned. The Synod at the <HI>Savoy,</HI> Earnestly asserts, <HI>That it is according to the Mind of CHRIST that Churches holding Communion together, do by their Messengers Meet in a Sy∣nod, or Council, to consider and give Advice,</HI>— [Thes. 26.] On such occasions as the Churches in this Country have also thought proper to come under such a Cognisance. The famous <HI>Apologists,</HI> (Dr. <HI>T. Goodwyn,</HI> Mr. <HI>Nye,</HI> Mr. <HI>Simpson,</HI> Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> Mr. <HI>Bridge,</HI>) p. 16. &amp;c. assert an Obligation hereunto, in the <HI>Common Law of Communion of Churches.</HI> Yea they profess, they look upon it as the
<PB N="11" REF="002149_0014_0FBCBDF84B403BD8"/><HI>most to be abhorred Maxim, and the most Contra∣dictory and Dishonourable to Christianity that a Single and Particular Society of Men Profes∣sing the Name of Christ, and pretending to be Endowed with power from Christ, should arrogate unto themselves an Exemption from giving an Account, or being censurable by Neighbour-Churches about them. So far</HI> (say these Su∣pereminent Divines of the Congregational way) <HI>were our Judgments from that</HI> INDE∣PENDENT <HI>Liberty, which has been impu∣ted to us.</HI> Dr. <HI>Ames</HI> Maintains That as the <HI>Right of calling an Ordinary Minister,</HI> is in <HI>the Church, which he is to serve,</HI> so, that Mat∣ters of <HI>Great Weight</HI> should be managed as much as may be, with the <HI>Consent</HI> of <HI>Parti∣cular Churches, confederated in Synods.</HI> [Med. l. 1. c. 39. §. 27, 30, 32, 36.] And, The Elders of <HI>New-England,</HI> in their Answer to the XXXII. Questions, <HI>p.</HI> 64. profess their Entire Consent with Dr. <HI>Ames.</HI> 27. Mr. <HI>Burroughs,</HI> in his <HI>Irenicum,</HI> says, [<HI>p.</HI> 43.]
<Q>Those in the <HI>Congregational Way</HI> ac∣knowledge, that they are bound in Con∣science, to give Account of their Ways, to Churches about them: And that <HI>Synods</HI> are an Ordinance of Jesus Christ, for the helping of the Church against Errors, Schisms, and Scandals. And that these
<PB N="12" REF="002149_0015_0FBCBDF95A923730"/><HI>Synods</HI> may, by the Power they have from Christ, Admonish Men or Churches in His Name, when they see Evils continuing in, or growing upon the Church. Yea They may by a Solemn Act in the Name of Jesus Christ, refuse any further <HI>Communion</HI> with them until they Repent.</Q> Mr. <HI>Cottons</HI> Book of, <HI>The Keys</HI> has all along been of high Account in the Churches of this Country; And in that Book, (as well as in the Preface to it Writ∣ten by Dr. <HI>Goodwin,</HI>) there is a full Testi∣mony born, to the Interest which <HI>Councils</HI> ought to have in ordering the Affairs of <HI>Con∣sociated Churches.</HI> It is more particularly said,
<Q>That it is an <HI>holy Ordinance of CHRIST,</HI> for <HI>Particular Churches</HI> to joyn together, in a Consociation among themselves, to ad∣minister their Church-affairs, which are of <HI>Weighty &amp; Difficult &amp; common concernment,</HI> not without common consultation, and con∣sent, of other Churches about them. Now Church-affairs of Weighty and Difficult, and common concernment, we account to be, the <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Ordination of Elders, Excommunication</HI> of an <HI>Elder,</HI> or any <HI>person of Publick Note,</HI>—and Employment; the <HI>Translation of an Elder</HI> from one Church to another.</Q> Mr. <HI>Hooker</HI>'s Survey, (Preface, <HI>p.</HI> 11.) observes.
<Q><HI>Consociation</HI> of Churches
<PB N="13" REF="002149_0016_0FBCBDFB1DEF6038"/>is not only lawful, but in some cases neces∣cessary. When causes are difficult &amp; parti∣cular Churches want light and help, they should crave the assistance of such a conso∣ciation. Churches so meeting, have right to counsel, rebuke, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as the case doth re∣quire. In case any particular Church shall walk pertinaciously, either in the profession of Error, or sinful practice, and will not hear their counsel, they may and should re∣nounce the right hand of fellowship with them.</Q> Dr. <HI>Owen,</HI> in several of his Treatises does advance Positions of the same Aspect on the Necessity &amp; Authority of Regular <HI>Coun∣cils,</HI> for the welfare of particular Churches. In one of his former, [Catech. p. 224.] he says,
<Q><HI>Churches</HI> ought to preserve a Mutual Holy communion, and Exercise it in making use of the Advice of one another. And in case any Church give offence to other Chur∣ches, other Churches may require an Ac∣count from them. Admenish them of their Faults, &amp; withold Communion from them, in case they persist in the Error of their way; and that because in their Difficulties, and before their Miscarriages, they were bound to have desired the Advice of other Chur∣ches; which being neglected by them, the other are to recover the End of it unto the
<PB N="14" REF="002149_0017_0FBCBE014D8833F0"/>utmost of their Ability.</Q> Thus Dr. <HI>Owen.</HI> And in one of his last, he has these Memorable words. [Nat. of Church. part 2. p. 251.]
<Q>No Church is so <HI>Independent,</HI> as that it can always, and in all cases observe the Duties it owes unto the Lord CHRIST, and the <HI>Church Catholick</HI> by all those Powers, which it is able to act in it self distinctly, without Conjunction with others. And the Church that confines its Duty unto the <HI>Acts of its own Assemblies,</HI> cuts it self off from the Ex∣ternal Communion of the <HI>Church Catholick:</HI> nor will it be safe for any Man to commit the conduct of his Soul to such a Church.— Every <HI>Particular Church</HI> which Extends not its Duty, beyond its own Assemblies and Members, is fallen off from the principal End of its Institution. And every Principle, Opinion, or Perswasion, that inclines any Church to confine its Care &amp; Duty unto its own Edification only;</Q> — is <HI>Schismatical.</HI> But <HI>Great has been the Army of them that have Published</HI> such Truths as these, whereof some∣thing may be further seen in, <HI>The first Prin∣ciples</HI> of <HI>New-England,</HI> Printed in the Year 1675. Unto all which we may add, what our celebrated <HI>Norton,</HI> has in his <HI>Last Sermons;</HI> Particularly, that passage,
<Q>Let us acknow∣ledge the Order of the Eldership in out
<PB N="15" REF="002149_0018_0FBCBE0265716B30"/>Churches, in their Way, and the Order of <HI>Councils</HI> in their Way, duely back'd &amp; En∣couraged; without which, Experience will witness that these Churches cannot long consist.</Q> Nor are the words of the worthy Mr. <HI>Samuel Danforth,</HI> (once Pastor of <HI>Roxbu∣ry,</HI>) in his Election-Sermon, in the Year 1670. unworthy to be recited.
<Q>In our First and Best Times, what Pious Cate was there of Sister Churches, — that in those that wanted Peace, their Dissensions might be healed? What Readiness was there in those Days to call for the Help of Neigh∣bour Elders &amp; Brethren in case of any Dif∣ference or Division that could not be healed at home? What Reverence was there then of the Sentence of a <HI>Council,</HI> as being <HI>Deci∣cive,</HI> and issuing the Controversy? Accor∣ding to that Ancient Proverbial saying, <HI>They shall surely ask Counsel at Abel, and so they Ended the Matter.</HI></Q></P>
<P>FROM whence, it will follow That if any of our Churches presume to Transact their more <HI>Weighty Affairs,</HI> and such as are of a <HI>Common Concern</HI> to the Churches in their Neighbourhood, with a <HI>Contempt</HI> of such <HI>Councils</HI> of them as ought to be advised with∣al; or, if they shall upon grievous Differences arisen among them, refuse the Advice of
<PB N="16" REF="002149_0019_0FBCBE084118A3C0"/>those who urge them to make use of the Re∣medy, which the want of <HI>Light</HI> &amp; <HI>Peace</HI> a∣mong them calleth for: and much more, if they shall proceed in Matters after the Neighbouring Churches have signified, that they cannot countenance their proceedings; those Churches will be far from Expressing the <HI>Wisdom</HI> which is <HI>with the well-advised;</HI> and will greatly Sin against the Second and Third Commandment; and will practically go too far towards Excluding themselves from Communion with the Churches of the Faithful. Indeed, the more <HI>Councils</HI> &amp; <HI>Sy∣nods</HI> are disregarded &amp; slighted, so much the more disorder and confusion will (we fear) grow &amp; prevail in all the Churches in the Country; which GOD of His Infinite Mercy prevent.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> CONCERNING the Case of <HI>Reinstal∣ling a Translated Pastor,</HI> which may also call for some Consideration; we need only Re∣port, what has been the <HI>Practice,</HI> of our Chur∣ches, in those very <HI>Few Examples,</HI> that have been <HI>most generally approved</HI> of. The <HI>Pastor</HI> having been (with the Advice of a <HI>Council</HI>) Regularly <HI>Released,</HI> and then <HI>Dismissed,</HI> from the Church where to he has been Related, the Church, whereto he has been upon a Trans∣lation,
<PB N="17" REF="002149_0020_0FBCBE0B60190E68"/>have sent unto the Neighbour Chur∣ches, to come and countenance his <HI>Instal∣ment,</HI> as they do for an ordinary <HI>Ordination.</HI> The Instalment has been with all the Cir∣cumstances &amp; Solemnities of an <HI>Ordination.</HI> Only, the <HI>Imposition of Hands,</HI> (which for∣merly was Renewed on such Occasions; Not as a <HI>Re-Ordination</HI> to the <HI>Ministry,</HI> but as a <HI>Disignation</HI> to the Charge of the <HI>Particular Flock:</HI>) has been laid aside of Latter time, in a Compliance with the <HI>Conscientious In∣disposition</HI> to it, in some worthy Ministers ar∣riving from Foreign Parts among us, and in∣vited into the <HI>Pastoral Care</HI> of our Churches. But yet a <HI>Charge</HI> has been used to be given by the Moderator, for the faithful Discharge of his Ministry, <HI>in this Place;</HI> and <HI>suitable Prayers</HI> accompany'd it; unto which has been added, <HI>The Right Hand of Fellowship,</HI> from the Churches. And indeed, All such Things ought for ever to be done <HI>Decently and in Order.</HI> And as we hear, Unbiassed Strangers coming among us, have sometimes confessed, <HI>That the most Solemn Actions they have ever seen in their Lives, have been the Ordinations in the Churches of</HI> New-England; so we cannot but wish, that they may never lose any thing of their Solemnity.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="002149_0021_0FBCBE0D2BA8A2C0"/>
To which end we find reason also to add our <HI>Testimony</HI> against all Indecency and Ir∣regularity in the Management of a Publick <HI>Dissent</HI> from and <HI>Opposition</HI> unto the Ordina∣tion or Instalment of a Pastor over a Flock, whensoever there may be Occasion for so Melancholly an Action, which rarely hap∣pens. We acknowledge the <HI>Right</HI> that every Christian has, and much more, that any <HI>Num∣ber</HI> of aggreived Brethren have, in an order∣ly Manner to object and declare against the Ordination of a Minister, or his Induction into the Pastoral Office over a Particular Flock, when they apprehend Sufficient Rea∣sons for doing so. But then Christianity requires that this be done, when it becomes necessary, with much Modesty &amp; Calmness, Meekness and Gravity, Wisdom and Serious∣ness; and not with a Noise, Wrath &amp; Bit∣terness, Disagreeable to such a Solemnity. Wherefore also, every Church ought very Carefully to avoid all Provocations, that may have a Tendency to drive things unto such Extremities; and therefore Seasonably to hear, and duely to Consider, what the Dissatisfied may have to offer.</P>
<P>FINALLY; We know not what <HI>Irregu∣larities</HI> may come to be committed in any
<PB N="19" REF="002149_0022_0FBCBE11241BE198"/>of our Churches, as <HI>Days of Temptation,</HI> and of <HI>Defection,</HI> may grow upon us. The Case may so happen, [with <HI>Sad Reflection</HI> may we say so!] that Churches may with much Temerity, Reject the Advice of Other Chur∣ches, and carry on their Affairs with so much Disorder and Confusion, as may open the Floodgates for a Torrent of Strife and Sin to break in, and much Damage arise to the Kingdom of GOD. In this Deplorable Case, there is an awful Proceedure directed in our <HI>Platform.</HI> [ch 15. §. 2.] <HI>If a Church be Rent with Divisions among themselves, or ly under any Open Scandal, and yet refuse to Consult with other Churches, for healing or re∣moving of the same, it is Matter of just Offence, both to the Lord JESUS, and to other Chur∣ches. — And therefore the State of such a Church calleth aloud upon other Churches, to Exercise a fuller Act of Brotherly Communion; to wit, By way of Admonition.</HI>—And, <HI>If still the Offending Church continue in Obstinacy and Impenitency, — and if they hear not the Sy∣nod. — the Synod having declared them to be Obstinate, Particular Churches, — are to de∣clare the Sentence of Non-Communion re∣spectively concerning them.</HI> And tho' for some special Reasons, in such a Day, it may
<PB N="20" REF="002149_0023_0FBCBE13451135F0"/>so fall out, that the Churches may not hasten unto such an <HI>Awful Proceedure,</HI> Yet it becomes those concerned, seriously to Con∣sider what is their Duty, least the Holy LORD, who <HI>Walks in the midst of His Chur∣ches,</HI> and is a <HI>GOD that will not be mocked,</HI> may testify His Displeasure in ways that are greatly to be trembled at: For, <HI>Our GOD is a consuming Fire:</HI> And, <HI>He is Ter∣rible in His Holy Places.</HI></P>
