<HEAD>The Watchman's Answer, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>ISAIAH xxi. 11, 12.</HI></BIBL>
<P>The Burden of <HI>DUMAH.</HI> He calleth to me out of <HI>SEIR,</HI> Watchman, What of the Night? Watch∣man, What of the Night? The Watchman said, The Morning cometh, and also the Night: if ye will enquire; enquire, ye; return; come.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IT may doubtless, at first View, appear strange to my Brethren, that I have chosen this <HI>obscure Pas∣sage</HI> of sacred Writ for your Entertainment; when it might be expected, that the <HI>Dignity</HI> &amp; <HI>Duties;</HI> the <HI>Comforts</HI> &amp; <HI>Trials</HI> of the ministerial Office should be explained, or the best Method of securing good Disci∣pline and sound Doctrine in the Church, laid open. These Subjects, I confess, are highly proper to be insisted on, and should generally be the Topics of our Discourse, on such Occasions as these. But, some dark Apprehensions, as to the <HI>Times</HI> into which we are fallen, turned my Mind to this Subject: And as it will lead our Thoughts to the present <HI>Dangers</HI> &amp; <HI>Trials;</HI> to the farther <HI>Prospects</HI> and <HI>Hopes</HI> relating to the Church of CHRIST, it will, I ima∣gine, when properly explained and applied, be tho't not unsuitable for those, who are assembled to consult its Wel∣fare and Prosperity.</P>
<P>WHAT I shall attempt, is,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="007863_0003_102DEAEA71472C60"/>I. <HI>To explain the Words, and illustrate the Prophesy, by such historical Events, as seem to point out the Fulfil∣ment of it, in its primary View.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Apply it to the State of the Church in general, and to the Times into which we are fallen, in particular▪</HI></P>
<P>THIS <HI>enigmatical Prophesy,</HI> seems in its primary View, to denote some further Calamity on the <HI>Idumeans,</HI> after the <HI>Jews</HI> should be delivered from the <HI>Darkness</HI> they were then under; that while the <HI>Morning</HI> arose to the one, the <HI>Night</HI> should be continued to the other. It is called the <HI>Burden</HI> of <HI>Dumah,</HI> because it brings sad and dark Tidings, what would prove an heavy Burden, hard to be born. <HI>Dumah</HI> here, by a Contraction not unusual in the sacred Writings, seems evidently to be put for <HI>E∣dom;</HI> and so for the Country <HI>Idumea,</HI> where the <HI>Edomites</HI> dwelt. This appears plain, by <HI>Seir's</HI> being mentioned as the Place from whence the <HI>Voice</HI> came, which was that mountainous Part of <HI>Idumea,</HI> that lay next to the Land of <HI>Canaan.</HI> The <HI>Septuagint</HI> therefore well translate it, <HI>To' Horamatees Idumais,</HI> i.e. the Vision of <HI>Idumea.</HI> In this <HI>prophetic Scene,</HI> there is one from that Country in∣troduced, as addressing the Prophet in great Earnestness, about the State of the <HI>Night,</HI> or that State of Affliction and Oppression, which both the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Idumeans</HI> were under. <HI>He calleth</HI> (or there is one that calleth, or crieth) <HI>to me out of</HI> Seir. The Word must be taken <HI>collectively,</HI> not denoting a particular Person, q.d. <HI>there is a Cry,</HI> or <HI>the Voice of those that cry from that Country;</HI> this ap∣pears from the Answer of the Prophet, <HI>If ye will enquire, &amp;c.</HI> 'Tis observed that the original Word <HI>Karah,</HI> has an <HI>Emphasis</HI> in it, &amp; denotes the <HI>Cry</HI> of Men in Anguish and Distress, impatiently waiting to see the End of their <HI>Cala∣mity,</HI> and the <HI>Dawn</HI> of the Morning of their Deliverance. This shews a Beauty in the <HI>scenical Representation;</HI> as the Prophet is on the Watch-Tower among the <HI>Jews,</HI> at a great Distance from <HI>Mount Seir,</HI> the Voice must be loud, in order to be heard. The Question follows, <Q><HI>Watchman,
<PB N="5" REF="007863_0004_102DEAECB37F51B0"/>
What of the Night,</HI> or from, or concerning the <HI>Night?</HI></Q> The Conjecture of <HI>Cocceius,</HI> and some other <HI>learned Com∣mentators,</HI> that the <HI>Voice</HI> is directed to GOD the Father, under the Character of <HI>a Watchman,</HI> because he is stiled the <HI>Keeper of</HI> Israel; or to the SON, who is represented as the <HI>Shepard of his People,</HI> I think groundless. It is not supposable, that the <HI>Idumeans</HI> had any such distinct Notion of the <HI>Father</HI> or the <HI>Son,</HI> as to address <HI>one</HI> or the <HI>other</HI> by this Title.—To apply it to the <HI>Prophet himself,</HI> seems much more natural; the Prophets being well known by the Character of <HI>Watchmen,</HI> as pointing out the <HI>Design</HI> and <HI>Duties</HI> of their Office: And thus they are frequent∣ly stiled in <HI>sacred Writ,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. lxii, 6.</NOTE> <HI>I have set Watchmen on thy Walls, O</HI> Jerusalem, "<HI>I have made thee,</HI> says GOD to <HI>Ezekiel, a Watchman to the House of</HI> Israel." <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ezek. iii, 17.</NOTE> The <HI>Character</HI> is taken from those that are set to <HI>guard a City,</HI> or on a <HI>Watch-Tower</HI> to descry approaching Dan∣ger, and give the Signal: And they ought to be Men of <HI>Courage,</HI> that will not be frighted at the Shaking of a Leaf; <HI>faithful,</HI> who will not betray their Trust; <HI>vigilant,</HI> that will not suffer the Enemy to come by Surprize while they are asleep; <HI>quick sighted,</HI> to spy the Danger; <HI>con∣stant</HI> and <HI>unwearied</HI> in their Attendance on the <HI>Duties</HI> of their Station; and being continually awake, it might be expected could readily give the <HI>Hour</HI> of the <HI>Night.</HI> 'Tis easy to see how applicable this is, not only to the <HI>Prophets,</HI> but to all the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel, who are set as <HI>Watchmen, on the Walls of GOD's Jerusalem;</HI> whose <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Business</HI> it is, to watch over the Heritage of the Lord; to give seasonable, plain &amp; faithful Warning to Saints &amp; Sinners. The various remarkable <HI>Dispensati∣ons</HI> of GOD to his <HI>Church,</HI> were revealed to the <HI>Pro∣phets;</HI> they foretold the <HI>desolating Judgments</HI> that were bro't not only on the <HI>Jews,</HI> but the neighbouring <HI>Nati∣ons;</HI> knew something of the Time, Manner &amp; Duration of the <HI>dark Night</HI> they had to pass thro'; and so might
<PB N="6" REF="007863_0005_102DEAEF0D654A70"/>
properly be inquired of as to this Matter—<HI>Watchman, What of the Night?</HI> What have you discovered as to the State of the <HI>Night?</HI> How far is it advanced? What remains? Do you discern any Signs of the <HI>Morning?</HI> Any Signs that the present Scene of <HI>Darkness</HI> will soon be over? The Question is undoubtedly not about a <HI>natural</HI> but <HI>metaphisical</HI> Night,—that State of <HI>Calamity</HI> &amp; <HI>Distress</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> &amp; <HI>Idumeans</HI> were under by the <HI>Assyrians</HI> or <HI>Babylonians;</HI> or, that <HI>dark Dispensation</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> the End of which was then expected, and earnestly desired. The <HI>Repetition</HI> of it, represents the <HI>Panic</HI> they were in; their <HI>Distress,</HI> or rather their <HI>Impatience,</HI> for an Answer.</P>
<P>IT may perhaps seem strange at <HI>first View,</HI> that the <HI>Idu∣means</HI> should make this Inquiry. What had they to do with the <HI>Prophets</HI> or the <HI>divine Oracles?</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii, 12.</NOTE> Who were <HI>Aliens from the Common-Wealth of</HI> Israel, <HI>&amp; Strangers from the Covenant of Promise.</HI>—But, the Difficulty will vanish, if we consider that the Scheme of this Prophesy is <HI>emblematical</HI> and <HI>figurative.</HI> The <HI>Idumeans</HI> are in∣troduced here by the <HI>Prophet,</HI> as breathing after Deli∣verance under their <HI>Calamities,</HI> and making such anxious Inquiries as it is natural to suppose a People in their <HI>Situ∣ation</HI> would; and hearing that Deliverance was expected by the <HI>Jewish Nation,</HI> it was natural for them to desire to know the <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of it, in Hopes they also might Share in its Favour.—To this may be added— That the eastern Nations had a Veneration for the <HI>Pro∣phets of the</HI> GOD <HI>of</HI> Israel, whose Fame was spread a∣mong them. And if we apply it to the then <HI>dark State</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> an Enquiry respecting a more glorious Dispensation, in which themselves, &amp; all the <HI>Gentile World</HI> were concerned, comes from them with singular Propriety. Some suppose the Question put by way of <HI>Derision,</HI> but I think without Foundation; had that been the Case, the <HI>Prophet</HI> would have given them a very different Answer. They seem to have a Degree of <HI>Earnestness</HI> about the
<PB N="7" REF="007863_0006_102DEAF1D25D2048"/>
Matter, and yet do not enquire with that <HI>Faith,</HI> and such <HI>religious Views</HI> as they ought. This is evident from the <HI>Prophets</HI> reply. <HI>The Morning cometh, and also the Night, if ye will enquire; enquire ye; return; come.</HI> i.e. The <HI>Morning</HI> will be as dangerous as the <HI>Night,</HI> say some. Others translate it, the <HI>Morning</HI> cometh, &amp; yet it is <HI>Night.</HI> i.e. Tho' there be a Deliverance from present Calamities, yet it will be but <HI>partial; Light</HI> comes, but <HI>Darkness</HI> will be intermixed with it; or according to our Transla∣tion, <HI>The Morning cometh, but the Night will soon succeed.</HI> It may mean, That tho' the <HI>Morning</HI> is coming to the <HI>People of GOD,</HI> it would still be <HI>Night</HI> with the <HI>Idumeans.</HI> 'Tis easy to see, that as <HI>Night</HI> is put for a State of <HI>Affliction, Day</HI> is a proper Emblem of <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Comfort. If ye will enquire; enquire, ye; return; come.</HI> The old <HI>English</HI> Translation under <HI>Henry the</HI> VIIIth, has it thus, <Q>If ye will enquire indeed, and ask Questions in Earnest, enquire of <HI>GOD;</HI> first ask his Mercy, and then come again, and you shall have a more favourable Answer:</Q> which seems not far from the true Meaning.</P>
<P>AS the Question, tho' not put with that Seriousness and Sincerity as it ought, implied a Desire to know the Pur∣pose of GOD relating to their <HI>present</HI> dark &amp; dismal Situ∣ation; the Answer seems to be to this Purpose, <HI>viz.</HI> Since you <HI>Idumeans,</HI> in your distressed Condition, seem to come to your selves, express a Desire of returning to GOD, and knowing his <HI>Will</HI> concerning you, be in earnest in the Matter, enquire with Hearts suitably affected, with the <HI>Dispensations</HI> of divine Providence, with sincere Desires to <HI>know</HI> and <HI>comply</HI> with your Duty. Return to the <HI>God of Israel,</HI> come into the <HI>Bosom</HI> &amp; <HI>Communion</HI> of the Church; since you are descended from <HI>Abraham,</HI> shew your selves to be his <HI>Children</HI> indeed; come with <HI>Sincerity</HI> &amp; <HI>Faith,</HI> to me and the other <HI>Prophets,</HI> to know the Mind &amp; Will of GOD, and be suitably prepared to meet him, when he shall come forth against you. The Sum of what I have said is this: The <HI>neighbouring Nations,</HI> groaning under
<PB N="8" REF="007863_0007_102DEAF384230948"/>
the same Oppression from the <HI>Assyrian</HI> and <HI>Babylonish Princes,</HI> as the <HI>Jews</HI> were, tho' the <HI>peculiar People</HI> of GOD, and favoured with his true <HI>Prophets;</HI> the <HI>Idumeans</HI> are introduced, enquiring after the <HI>Duration,</HI> and End of this common Calamity in too careless a Manner, with too little Reverence or religious Sense of the Divine Dispensation. They have for Answer, That the <HI>Morn∣ing</HI> was coming, i. e. <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Liberty</HI> to the <HI>Jews;</HI> but that the <HI>Night</HI> still awaited them; i.e. their present Afflictions and spiritual Darkness, would continue, while they maintain'd their <HI>present Temper</HI> of Mind towards GOD, and remained <HI>Strangers to the Common-Wealth of Israel.</HI> He therefore exhorts them to return to GOD, and enquire with a religious Disposition, and right <HI>Views</HI> about this Matter.</P>
<P>THIS Interpretation may be illustrated by <HI>historical Events;</HI> either by referring it to the common Calamities that befel the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Idumeans,</HI> with other <HI>neighbour∣ing Nations,</HI> under <HI>Senacherib</HI> King of <HI>Assyria;</HI> or to that which afterwards befel them under the Kings of <HI>Ba∣bylon.</HI> If to the <HI>former,</HI> the <HI>Morning</HI> that arose to the <HI>Jews,</HI> must be the <HI>miraculous Deliverance</HI> granted them, by the terrible Destruction of the <HI>Assyrian Army</HI> by an Angel.<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">2 Kin, xix. 35.</NOTE> The like Deliverance not being granted to the <HI>Idumeans,</HI> with them it remained <HI>Night.</HI> But, I rather suppose it may refer to the <HI>Babylonish Captivity,</HI> which involved the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Idumeans</HI> in one common <HI>Night</HI> of Calamity and Distress, after which <HI>long Night,</HI> where∣in the Church seemed as it were buried, a <HI>glorious Morn∣ing</HI> arose to the <HI>Jews,</HI> from the Deliverance granted by <HI>Cyrus;</HI> while the <HI>Idumeans</HI> continued in Darkness; as appears by <HI>Malachi,</HI> who lived after the Return of the <HI>Jews</HI> from the <HI>Babylonish Captivity;</HI> and describes the <HI>Idumeans</HI> as impoverished, unable to return and rebuild their waste Places; being under the peculiar Displeasure of Heaven. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. i. 1, 2, 3, 4.</NOTE> <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> We come now,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="9" REF="007863_0008_102DEAF594A0B360"/>II. <HI>To another View in which this prophetic Descrip∣tion may be taken, and with Propriety applied to some remarkable Periods in the Church.</HI></P>
<P>AS the <HI>Prophets</HI> were set as <HI>Watchmen,</HI> on the <HI>Walls of God's Jerusalem,</HI> to publish his Designs of Mercy and Judgment to the <HI>Church</HI> and the <HI>World;</HI> such as were concerned to know the <HI>Times</HI> &amp; <HI>Seasons</HI> of God's favour∣ing his <HI>Zion,</HI> would naturally enquire at <HI>their Mouths,</HI> and as the <HI>Idumeans</HI> sprang originally from the <HI>same Family</HI> with the <HI>Jews,</HI> and bordered upon them, they had doubt∣less some Acquaintance with their <HI>sacred Writings.</HI> Some <HI>Prophecies</HI> had a particular Reference to them. It was foretold, that Edom <HI>should be a Possession, and</HI> Seir a <HI>Pos∣session of their Enemies.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Numb xxiv. 18.</NOTE> It is natural therefore to sup∣pose, that the more tho'tful among them, were looking for this Period, and being oppressed with Difficulties, were excited to enquire after the <HI>Time</HI> when they should be delivered from their <HI>spiritual Darkness,</HI> and united to the <HI>People of God.</HI> This Prophesy of <HI>Edom's being a Possession of their Enemies,</HI> was in Part accomplished under the <HI>As∣monean Family,</HI> when the <HI>Edomites</HI> were subdued by the <HI>Jews,</HI> many of them bro't to embrace their <HI>Religion,</HI> and their Country became their <HI>Possession.</HI> To this <HI>Time,</HI> the <HI>Prophet</HI> may have a View, when 'tis supposed they would not neglect the <HI>sacred Writings,</HI> but get some Acquaintance with those Prophesies, wherein <HI>grorious Things</HI> were spoken of <HI>Zion,</HI> when the present dark and gloomy Dispensation should be at an <HI>end,</HI> and the <HI>Gentiles</HI> partake of the <HI>same Privileges</HI> with the <HI>Jews.</HI> This must excite in all who had any due Esteem for <HI>spiri∣tual Blessings,</HI> a Desire to be informed when the happy <HI>Aera</HI> would arrive. In this View, the <HI>Question,</HI> the <HI>Answer</HI> of the <HI>Watchman,</HI> his <HI>Admonition,</HI> to return and continue their Enquirers with more Seriousness and better Views, all appear <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>proper.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="007863_0009_102DEAF736850FD0"/>BY the <HI>Night,</HI> we may understand the obscure Dis∣pensation they were then under, which was ushered in with <HI>Blackness, Darkness, and a thick Tempest.</HI> It is therefore called a <HI>Ministration of Death, and Condem∣nation,</HI> and proved so to the carnal <HI>Jews,</HI> who rested in the <HI>Law graven on Stones,</HI> not looking to <HI>him</HI> who was the <HI>End of it for Righteousness to all that believe.</HI></P>
<P>THAT <HI>Ministration</HI> was indeed <HI>glorious,</HI> as it refered to, and pointed out the <HI>Glories</HI> of the <HI>Gospel;</HI> but how divinely glorious soever it was in itself, yet in Respect to the transcending Glory of that Dispensation of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Grace,</HI> which it shadowed forth, it might be said to have <HI>no Glory;</HI> the Lustre of it was swallowed up by the surpassing Glory of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> as the dim Light of the <HI>Moon</HI> and <HI>twinkling Stars,</HI> vanishes before the <HI>rising Sun.</HI> This Dispensation was not only <HI>gloomy</HI> and <HI>dark,</HI> when compared to the <HI>superior Light</HI> of the <HI>Christian Revelation,</HI> but was in a peculiar Manner so, by Reason of the <HI>Blindness, Prejudices</HI> and <HI>Unbelief,</HI> of those to whom it was given; which is fitly represented by the <HI>Vail Moses</HI> put on his Face while he delivered them the Law, to cover its <HI>dazzling Brightness,</HI> which they could not behold. This <HI>Vail</HI> the Apostle expresly tell us, was on their <HI>Hearts,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii. 13, 14.</NOTE> <HI>so that they could not look to the End of that which was to be abolished.</HI> They were as un∣able to behold the <HI>Mind of Moses</HI> in that <HI>Oeconomy,</HI> as they were his <HI>Face;</HI> when he turned to the Lord he took off the <HI>Vail;</HI> which implies, that <HI>that Dispensa∣tion,</HI> as it came from God, and was revealed to him, was full of <HI>Grace,</HI> and shone with a divine Lustre; but when he conversed with the People he had it on, for the internal Glories of his Ministration which were delivered in <HI>Types</HI> and <HI>Figures of good Things to come,</HI> were ren∣der'd obscure and dark, by the <HI>Blindness</HI> &amp; <HI>Prejudices</HI> of their carnal Hearts When they shall turn to the Lord, at the <HI>blessed Period</HI> of their general Conversion, this <HI>Vail</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="007863_0010_102DEAF8E1F9DC58"/>
shall be taken away, and they shall clearly see how the <HI>glorious Grace</HI> of the <HI>Gospel</HI> was revealed under all the <HI>Types</HI> and <HI>Shadows</HI> of the <HI>Law.</HI> But, by Reason of the <HI>Darkness</HI> of their Minds, and the <HI>obscure Manner</HI> in which Christ, and the Blessings of his Kingdom, were then tipified, the <HI>Church</HI> continued in a dark &amp; benighted State. There was indeed a Mixture of Light with that Darkness; the <HI>Prophets</HI> were like so many <HI>shining Stars</HI> in the <HI>Church,</HI> and they had many <HI>sure Words of Prophesy, to which they might give Heed;</HI> but it was only as to a <HI>Light shining in a dark Place, till the Day-star appeared,</HI> and <HI>the glorious Sun of Righteousness arose.</HI></P>
<P>AND 'tis worthy Observation, that the <HI>Night</HI> was pe∣culiarly <HI>gloomy,</HI> towards the Close of this Dispensation, when the Darkness was much increased, by almost con∣tinual <HI>Persecutions</HI> and <HI>Oppressions,</HI> from the <HI>Kings</HI> of <HI>Syria</HI> without; while the <HI>internal Glories</HI> of it were greatly obscured, and almost wholly lost, by those dange∣rous Corruptions in <HI>Doctrine, Discipline and Worship,</HI> which then over-spread the <HI>Jewish Church,</HI> and those scandalous Divisions into which it fell.</P>
<P>IT was also eminently <HI>Night,</HI> with the <HI>Gentile World,</HI> who being sunk into deplorable Darkness, were given up to the most abominable Idolatry and vile Affections. But as an Expectation of the Coming of the <HI>Messiah,</HI> the pro∣mised Deliverer, began now to prevail and become gene∣ral, 'tis not strange, that some among the <HI>Gentles,</HI> as well as the <HI>Jews,</HI> are represented, crying to the <HI>Watch∣man, What of the Night?</HI> When will the <HI>Darkness</HI> of the present Dispensation be over, and a <HI>Deliverer come out of</HI> Zion, <HI>to turn away Iniquity from</HI> Jacob? When will those Times of Ignorance which God has hitherto winked at in the <HI>Gentile World,</HI> be at an End, and Light arise to those that now <HI>sit in the Region of the Shadow of Death?</HI> How much of this dark Season is past? What yet remains? When will the Day break by the Appea∣rance of that <HI>glorious Person, who is to be a Light to the
<PB N="12" REF="007863_0011_102DEAFBC6CE62C8"/>
Gentiles, and a Glory to God's People</HI> Israel? It might be supposed, that the <HI>Watchmen</HI> who were <HI>enquiring and searching diligently, what Manner of Time the Spirit in them did signify, when it testified before Hand, the Sufferings of Christ, and the Glory that should follow,</HI> could give an Answer to such a Question, as the <HI>Time</HI> and <HI>Manner</HI> of his Appaarance were so clearly pointed out. They might see, that the <HI>Scepter</HI> was a∣bout to depart from <HI>Judah,</HI> according to <HI>Jacob's Pro∣phesy</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xlix. 10.</NOTE>. That <HI>Daniel's</HI> 70 <HI>Weeks,</HI> or 490 Years, were near expiring. And as it must be during the Standing of the <HI>second Temple,</HI> to which he was suddenly to come, and fill with his Glory, according to <HI>Malachi</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mal. iii. 1.</NOTE>, it could not be long delayed. By these Hints, the <HI>Watchmen</HI> might know the <HI>Night was far spent,</HI> and answer as in the Text, <HI>The Morning cometh,</HI> the long expected Day is at Hand. In this View of the Words, the <HI>Watchman's</HI> Answer, that <HI>the Morning cometh,</HI> may point out the <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Joy</HI> brought to the World by the Appearance of the <HI>Son of God.</HI> The Day began to dawn under the Ministry of <HI>John the Baptist.</HI> He was indeed <HI>a burn∣ing and a shining Light,</HI> compared with the other <HI>Pro∣phets;</HI> but was not the <HI>true Light,</HI> tho' like the Morning Star he ushered in the <HI>Day.</HI> But when the <HI>Sun of Righteousness arose with Healing under his Wings,</HI> he diffused <HI>Light, Life,</HI> and <HI>Joy,</HI> thro' a dark, dead, and chearless World. The Shadows of the former Dispen∣sation, and the thick Clouds of <HI>heathenish Ignorance</HI> and <HI>Superstition,</HI> fled before him, as the Darkness of the Night before the rising Sun. It was prophesied of him, that his <HI>going forth, should be prepared as the Morning.</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Hos. vi. 3. Luke ii. 11.</NOTE> As the natural Sun in the Morning spreads <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Gladness,</HI> thro' the wide Creation, so did CHRIST thro' a lost and ruined World. The Angel brings the News of his Birth, as Tidings of <HI>great Joy to all People.</HI> The Gospel preached in his Name was a ravishing Sound to all that

heard and received it: Like the Morning Light, it spread far and wide; grew brighter and brighter, towards a <HI>per∣fect Day.</HI> It had <HI>free Course and was glorified;</HI> tri∣umphing over all the Opposition of <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Hell.</HI></P>
<P>WITH what divine Lustre and Beauty did the <HI>Church</HI> shine, in this <HI>Morning</HI> of her Days, when the pure <HI>Doct∣rines</HI> of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> were taught without that corrupt Mixture, which the Pride &amp; Ignorance of Men have since introduced. She was as a <HI>City set on a Hill,</HI> and Mul∣titudes both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> rejoyced in her Light. She seemed to answer the Description given of her by <HI>St. John,</HI> in his prophetic Vision; <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rev. xii. 1.</NOTE> where she is represented as <HI>clothed with the Sun, having the Moon under her Feet, and a Crown of twelve Stars on her Head;</HI> a beautiful Image, expressing, in a lively Manner, the <HI>Glory, Honour,</HI> and <HI>Dignity</HI> of the <HI>Church.</HI> There appeared in her Members, in this <HI>early Age,</HI> such genuine <HI>Piety,</HI> and fervent <HI>Devotion;</HI> such lively <HI>Hope,</HI> &amp; strong <HI>Faith;</HI> such warm and unfeigned <HI>Love</HI> to one another; such <HI>Meekness,</HI> and undissembled <HI>Humility;</HI> such <HI>Hea∣venly-mindedness</HI> and <HI>Deadness</HI> to the World; such uni∣versal <HI>Holiness,</HI> and <HI>Purity</HI> of Life; and made them <HI>shine like Lights in the World.</HI> Religion then appear'd <HI>amiable</HI> and <HI>alluring,</HI> as exemplified in the Lives of Pro∣fessors; which tended greatly to the propagating the Gospel. The Brightness of this Morning was soon ob∣scured. Many Errors of pernicious Influence crept into the <HI>Church,</HI> even while under the Conduct of inspired Men: But after the <HI>Apostles</HI> Decease, <HI>Men of corrupt Minds,</HI> began with more Freedom, to propagate their dangerous Doctrines, and licentious Practices, <HI>bringing swift Destruction on themselves,</HI> and their Followers. Towards the Close of the <HI>first,</HI> and during the <HI>second</HI> and <HI>third Centuries,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> was greatly infested with Persons, who advanced the most absurd and dange∣rous Opinions, tending to the Destruction of all <HI>natural</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="007863_0013_102DEB004CB2DEA8"/>
and <HI>revealed</HI> Religion;— the <HI>Nicolaitans,</HI> various Sects of the <HI>Gnostics, Corinthians, Valentinians, Marcionites,</HI> and <HI>Manichaeans,</HI> with a Train of other <HI>Heretics,</HI> who appeared in the <HI>early Ages</HI> of the Church; venting many impious Notions about <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Christ; the Origin of Good and Evil;</HI> the <HI>sacred Writings;</HI> and <HI>the Way of Salvation by Christ;</HI> to the great Reproach and Hin∣drance of the Gospel.—Some making GOD the <HI>Author</HI> of Sin; others denying the <HI>Unity</HI> of the <HI>Godhead;</HI> some the <HI>Divinity,</HI> and many the <HI>Humanity</HI> of CHRIST; while others even blasphemously pretended to be the <HI>Sa∣viour</HI> of the World themselves. What added to the Scandal of their Errors, the vilest <HI>Debaucheries,</HI> — the most abominable <HI>Crimes</HI> were countenanced &amp; practised, under the <HI>Cloke</HI> of Religion; which the <HI>Enemies</HI> of Christianity, were malicious enough to impute, however unjustly, to all its Professors. While the Church was thus darkened, corrupted, and exceedingly scandalised by Heresies <HI>within;</HI> she was almost continually harrassed with violent Oppressions and cruel Persecutions, under the <HI>heathen Emperors</HI> from <HI>without;</HI> which continued with but little Intervals of <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Rest,</HI> during the three first Centuries. Tho' there was, in those <HI>early Ages</HI> of Christianity, much spiritual Light, and plentiful Commu∣nications of Divine Grace; yet during the ten <HI>general Persecutions,</HI> which so quickly succeeded one another, it might well be called <HI>Night;</HI> when compared to that State of <HI>external Peace</HI> &amp; <HI>Prosperity,</HI> which the Church shall enjoy in the <HI>latter Days,</HI> &amp;c. with Respect to the glorious Diffusion of <HI>Gospel Light,</HI> which may then be expected.</P>
<P>AT the Close of the <HI>third,</HI> &amp; Beginning of the <HI>fourth Century,</HI> the <HI>Church</HI> was reduced to the last <HI>Extremity,</HI> by a Number of cruel Persecutors, who seemed to com∣bine together, for the utter Destruction of the Christian <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Cause. Galerius, Diocletian, Maximin,</HI> and <HI>Maxentius,</HI> acted as if they vied with one another, in the
<PB N="15" REF="007863_0014_102DEB01EF8D62B8"/>
unheard of <HI>Cruelties,</HI> and monstrous <HI>Barbarities,</HI> exer∣cised towards the <HI>innocent Disciples</HI> of CHRIST: But the Churches <HI>Extremity,</HI> is GOD'S <HI>Opportunity;</HI> He begins to make <HI>bare his Arm;</HI> visibly to espouse the <HI>Cause</HI> of his distressed People; and to <HI>recompence Vengeance to those that afflicted them. Galerius,</HI> being seized with an incurable and intolerable Disease, expires in the Midst of most bitter Anguish and Torment. <HI>Diocletian,</HI> forced to resign his Authority, oppressed with a <HI>Load of Guilt,</HI> groans and sighs away his miserable Life. <HI>Maximin,</HI> after being defeated by <HI>Licinius,</HI> attempts to put an End to his own Life; but dies a lingering Death, amidst the most amazing Torments, acknowledging his <HI>Guilt,</HI> in having persecuted the <HI>Chirstians.</HI> In this <HI>dark Period,</HI> GOD also raises up that great <HI>Deliverer</HI> and <HI>Defender</HI> of his Church, <HI>Constantine;</HI> who, <HI>A. D.</HI> 312, gains a compleat Victory over that cruel <HI>Tyrant</HI> and grand <HI>Per∣secutor, Maxentius;</HI> which gave rest to the Church in the <HI>West:</HI> And the Death of <HI>Licinius,</HI> which happened soon after, who was first a <HI>Favourer,</HI> but afterwards a cruel <HI>Persecutor</HI> of the Christians, seemed to put an End to all their Troubles: They enjoyed free Liberty every where. <HI>Constantine</HI> ascribes the Glory of all his Victories, to the <HI>God and Father of our Lord,</HI> JESUS CHRIST. And as a Token of Gratitude, gives public Countenance to the <HI>Christian Religion;</HI> secures it by <HI>Edicts</HI> and <HI>Laws;</HI> erects <HI>Schools;</HI> builds and endows <HI>Churches;</HI> bestows many <HI>Immunities</HI> and <HI>Privileges</HI> on the Clergy, and dis∣tinguishes them with many public <HI>Marks</HI> of Honour and Respect. Thus the Darkness which had overspread the <HI>Church,</HI> began to scatter, and the <HI>Morning</HI> to appear. The Gospel had <HI>free Course</HI> and was <HI>glorified;</HI> there was opened an <HI>effectual Door,</HI> which no Man was al∣lowed to shut. A delightful Scene seemed now to open on the <HI>Church,</HI> and looked like the Beginning of a bright and glorious <HI>Day.</HI> Many had raised Expectations, that the happy Period was now come, when the <HI>Kingdoms of
<PB N="16" REF="007863_0015_102DEB0395F7B3F8"/>
this World, would become the Kingdoms of our Lord, and his Christ:</HI> But alas! how different did the Event prove. This <HI>Morning</HI> was soon overcast, &amp; succeeded by a dark and dismal <HI>Night.</HI> The Honours, Dignities and Riches conferred on the <HI>Clergy,</HI> and the <HI>Church,</HI> introduced Luxury, Pride and Ignorance, with a long Train of dan∣gerous Consequences. About this Time, the <HI>Arian He∣resy</HI> sprung up, and spreading itself over a great Part of the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> proved destructive to the <HI>Faith once delivered to the Saints;</HI> threw the <HI>Church</HI> into great Confusions, and produced very sore Persecutions: The <HI>Emperors</HI> favouring sometimes the <HI>Arian;</HI> &amp; some∣times the <HI>orthodox</HI> Party; which brought infinite Scandal on the Christian Name, &amp; caused the Enemy to blaspheme.</P>
<P>SOON after Christianity had spread over a great Part of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> under Protection of the Govern∣ment; the most terrible Desolation, was brought on the <HI>Western Empire,</HI> by the northern barbarous Nations, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Goths, Vandals, Almains, Sarmatians, Picts</HI> and <HI>Scots;</HI> who seemed to conspire together for its utter Ruin, and for a long Time continued wasting, burning, &amp; de∣stroying all before them. About <HI>A. D.</HI> 410, <HI>Alaricus</HI> the <HI>Goth,</HI> sacked and plundered <HI>Rome;</HI> about Fifty-five Years after which, it was again plundered, and burnt by <HI>Gensericus,</HI> the <HI>Vandal.</HI> Soon after, it met with the same Fate from <HI>Richomerus</HI> 472; twice by <HI>Totila;</HI> and again by <HI>Attila,</HI> King of the <HI>Huns,</HI> who was above all the Rest, a sore <HI>Scourge,</HI> in the Hand of Providence, to the degenerate Christians of that Day.</P>
<P>WHILE the <HI>Empire</HI> was in this dreadful Confusion, by those <HI>barbarous Nations,</HI> gross Ignorance began to overspread the <HI>Christian World;</HI> for, by the Ravages they committed, <HI>Schools</HI> were dissipated, <HI>Ministers</HI> ba∣nished, and <HI>Learning</HI> buried. Those who were then on the <HI>Stage,</HI> being soon wasted with the <HI>Sword</HI> and <HI>Age;</HI> the rising Generation grew up in lamentable Ignorance. The most indeed of the Rulers of those <HI>barbarous Na∣tions</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="007863_0016_102DEB05C60296E8"/>
embraced Christianity; but being very Ignorant, became an easy Prey to the <HI>Pride</HI> &amp; <HI>Policy</HI> of the cor∣rupt and degenerate <HI>Clergy</HI> of the Day. This Oppor∣tunity the <HI>Bishop of Rome</HI> improved, to set himself up as the <HI>Head</HI> of the <HI>Church;</HI> the <HI>Successor</HI> of ST. PE∣TER; CHRIST'S <HI>Vicar on Earth;</HI> and found it but too easy a Matter to impose on those weak <HI>Princes,</HI> and an ignorant <HI>People,</HI> and thus to introduce those gross <HI>Corruptions, Superstitions,</HI> and false <HI>Doctrines,</HI> which have since proved so fatal to the Church: Thus <HI>Anti-christ</HI> began to be revealed, and gradually grew up to that <HI>Height</HI> of Wickedness, which he afterwards dis∣covered; <HI>exalting himself above all that is called God.</HI> The Darkness of this <HI>Night,</HI> brought on the Church, by Ignorance, Superstition, and the abominable Corruptions of <HI>Popery,</HI> were greatly increased by the <HI>Rise</HI> of that false Prophet and great Impostor <HI>Mahomet,</HI> who made his Appearance, <HI>A. D.</HI> 606; and notwithstanding the People of <HI>Mecca,</HI> attempted to crush the <HI>Impostor</HI> in the Bud, yet, <HI>A. D.</HI> 615, it began to spread; for hav∣ing by an apostate <HI>Jew,</HI> and <HI>Nestorian Monk,</HI> composed his <HI>Alcoran,</HI> and deluded his Followers, with a Notion of his being raised up by God, to institute a <HI>new Re∣ligion;</HI> he teaches them, that it is to be propagated by the Sword, and that it is meritorious to die for it.—By this Means, he soon brought all <HI>Arabia</HI> into his Power; and his Followers (who, from their pretended Descent from <HI>Sarah, Abraham</HI>'s Wife, were called <HI>Saracens</HI>) soon over-run the greatest Part of <HI>Asia,</HI> and began to spread themselves exceeding fast in <HI>Europe,</HI> till their memorable Defeat by <HI>Charles Martel, A. D.</HI> 734.</P>
<P>THE Miseries brought on the Christian Church, by the Spread of this Impostor, were exceeding great. The glorious Light of the Gospel, which began to be obscured, with the <HI>Errors</HI> and <HI>Corruptions</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> seemed as if it would have been wholly extinguished. By <HI>this</HI> they brought such Ignorance &amp; Error, Deceit, Vio∣lence
<PB N="18" REF="007863_0017_102DEB07F03310C8"/>
and Slavery, where ever they came, that it seemed as if the bottomless Pit had been opened, and <HI>Satan</HI> at the <HI>Head</HI> of the Powers of Darkness, come forth, accor∣ding to the prophetic Description of the <HI>Rise</HI> of this <HI>Im∣postor, Rev.</HI> ix. 2. <HI>And he opened the bottomless Pit, and there arose a Smoke out of the Pit, as the Smoke of a great Furnace, and the Sun and Air were darkened by Reason of the Smoke of the Pit, and out of the Smoke Locusts came,</HI> which fitly enough describes the Misery and Woe, stupid Ignorance and Superstition, which every where attended the Progress of the <HI>Mahometan Religion.</HI> The coming up of the <HI>Locusts,</HI> and Destruction they make where ever they go, <HI>emphatically represents</HI> the amazing and destructive Progress of the <HI>Saracens.</HI></P>
<P>THIS dark and dismal <HI>Night,</HI> brought on the Church by the Rise of <HI>Popery,</HI> on the one Hand, and the <HI>Ma∣hometan Impostor</HI> on the other, continued for a long Time with but a little glimmering of Gospel Light, a∣mong a few that kept the Faith: Religion and Learning seemed likely to be banished from the World. But at the Close of the 15th, and Beginning of the 16th Cen∣turies, the Day began to dawn, by a glorious <HI>Reforma∣tion,</HI> which had been attempted, and struggled for, by <HI>Wickliff,</HI> in <HI>England;</HI> the <HI>Waldenses</HI> and <HI>Albigenses,</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> and <HI>John Huss,</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> long before: But was now carried on by <HI>Luther,</HI> under the Protection of the <HI>Elector</HI> of <HI>Saxony,</HI> with surprizing Success, in many Parts of <HI>Germany;</HI> who was joined by <HI>Melancton,</HI> and other noble <HI>Reformers;</HI> whilst <HI>Calvin,</HI> at <HI>Geveva, Zwing∣lius</HI> and <HI>Farellus,</HI> with a Train of faithful Witnesses for the Truth who appeared about this Time, were strenu∣ously supporting, and vigorously carrying on, (tho' with some small Difference, in lesser Matters) the same glo∣rious Cause. The Light of the Gospel seemed for a Season to shine brighter and brighter, spread far &amp; wide in Spite of all the Methods the <HI>Popish Party</HI> made use of, by <HI>Bulls, Decrees of Councils,</HI> and the most unheard
<PB N="19" REF="007863_0018_102DEB0AEF835C50"/>
of <HI>Cruelties,</HI> to stop and suppress it. The <HI>Pope</HI>'s Au∣thority began very fast to decline. The Nations of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> &amp; <HI>Ireland,</HI> the northern Kingdoms of <HI>Denmark</HI> and <HI>Sweden,</HI> with great Numbers in <HI>France, Hungary</HI> &amp; <HI>Bohemia,</HI> all received the <HI>Reformation,</HI> and disclaimed any Subjection to the <HI>Kingdom of the Beast.</HI></P>
<P>THESE Things appeared like the Beginning of a joy∣ful <HI>Day,</HI> and many were ready to think, the glorious Things spoken <HI>Zion,</HI> in the <HI>latter Days,</HI> were now at Hand. There appeared in many of the first <HI>Reformers,</HI> such a Love to the Truth, and Zeal for practical Godliness, as gave a fair Prospect of a thorough <HI>Reformation;</HI> from all the Corruptions in <HI>Doctrine, Discipline</HI> and <HI>Worship,</HI> which had crept into the <HI>Church:</HI> But the Event fell far short of the raised Hopes of <HI>Zion</HI>'s Friends. In many Places it was carried on chiefly by the civil Magistrate, who went no farther than to answer their <HI>political Schemes,</HI> and in most it was too much a <HI>formal, nominal</HI> Thing, conducted by the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of this <HI>World.</HI> So that it soon came to a Stand, and has been for many Years past on the Decline, as to the Principles and Practice of <HI>real Re∣ligion,</HI> and this sad Declension is growing fast on the pre∣sent Generation.</P>
<P>SOME may be ready perhaps by this Time, to put to Me the Question in the Text, <HI>Watchman, what of the Night?</HI> Whereabouts are Wo? Is it <HI>Night,</HI> or <HI>Day?</HI> What are the Signs of the <HI>Times,</HI> in which we are fallen? What may we look for? To which I answer, I am very far from pretending to a Spirit of Prophesy, or any such Insight into the prophetic Writings, as precisely to fix the Dates of those <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Seasons,</HI> about which learned and pious Men have so widely differed; I may venture however, to affirm, some Things that appear <HI>evident</HI> and <HI>plain,</HI> and modestly offer my Thoughts about others, more <HI>doubtful</HI> and <HI>uncertain.</HI></P>
<P>IT is, I think, every evident, that the <HI>Night</HI> brought on the Church, by the Delusions and Superstitiom of
<PB N="20" REF="007863_0019_102DEB0CA02727C8"/>
<HI>Mahomet,</HI> and the <HI>Pope</HI> still continues. Notwithstand∣ing the frequent Appearances of the <HI>Morning,</HI> the <HI>Dark∣ness</HI> still remains, and at present seems to increase. <HI>Po∣pery</HI> did indeed receive a great Wound at the <HI>Refor∣mation,</HI> and the <HI>Pope</HI> considered as a temporal Prince, has, as to his <HI>secular Power,</HI> been ever since, very much on the Decline, very little Regard being paid him to what former∣ly was; but this in many, arises more from Contempt of the <HI>Gospel,</HI> &amp; all <HI>revealed Religion,</HI> than a Dislike to the Cor∣ruptions of <HI>Popery,</HI> or Regard to the Truth; and however, he be declined in secular Power, the <HI>Popish Religion,</HI> still greatly prevails. The greatest Part of <HI>Christendom</HI> are <HI>professedly</HI> of that Communion, and <HI>acknowledge</HI> Subjec∣tion to the <HI>Pope,</HI> as their spiritual Head; and the corrupt Doctrines of <HI>that</HI> Church, have of late Years very much prevailed in Protestant Countries.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Turks,</HI> who when they defeated the <HI>Saracens,</HI> adopted their <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Manners,</HI> which they have ever since been propagating, by their victorious Arms, (tho' they have been something weakened by their late Wars with the <HI>Germans</HI>) are yet in Possession of a conside∣rable Part of <HI>Asia, Europe,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> where the Christian Religion formerly flourished. The <HI>Mahometans</HI> have ever been professed Enemies to Christianity, and endeavour to root it out wherever they come, and are at present, the greatest <HI>Obstacle</HI> in the Way of spreading the <HI>Gospel.</HI> And how great a Part of the World is yet involved in <HI>heathenish Darkness</HI> and <HI>Idolatry?</HI> When with these Things, we consider the sad Declensions, Corruptions and Divisions of the <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> we are constrained to pronounce it <HI>Night.</HI> The Light of the Gospel does indeed shine, but tis like twinkling Stars in the Midst of <HI>Darkness,</HI> and <HI>Error.</HI></P>
<P>SHOULD it now be enquired, What of this <HI>Night?</HI> How far is it advanced? And how much is yet to come? I answer, it appears to me, that we are in the <HI>Close</HI> of this dark <HI>Night,</HI> &amp; that the <HI>Morning</HI> cometh. Could we de∣termine
<PB N="21" REF="007863_0020_102DEB0EB5939768"/>
when this <HI>Night</HI> began, it would be easy to fix on the Time of it's <HI>End;</HI> the <HI>Duration</HI> of it being plainly pointed out in prophetic Writings. The <HI>Beast</HI> to whom the <HI>Dragon</HI> (the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor) gave his <HI>Seat, Authority,</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> was to continue <HI>speaking great Things &amp; Blasphemies,</HI> 42 <HI>Months,</HI> Rev. xiii. 2. &amp; 5; which is just equal to the <HI>Time, Times and half Time▪</HI> while the <HI>Woman,</HI> i. e. the <HI>Chruch is drove into the Wilderness, and there nourished,</HI> Rev. xii 14. Dur∣ing this <HI>Period,</HI> the <HI>Witnesses are to prophesy in Sack-cloth,</HI> or the faithful Messengers of CHRIST, are to Labour under Discouragements and Opposition, which was to continue 1260 <HI>Days,</HI> Rev. xi. 3. These several Numbers in prophetic Stile, taking a <HI>Day</HI> for a <HI>Year,</HI> make the same Period 1260 Years. So long the per∣secuting Power of the <HI>Beast</HI> will continue; and while it does, the <HI>Church</HI> will be in a <HI>Wilderness State,</HI> and the faithful Ministers of CHRIST will Prophesy in Sack-cloth. This persecuted, oppressed, benighted State of the <HI>Church,</HI> will be succeeded by those glorious Times, when <HI>Satan</HI> will be confined to the <HI>bottomless Pit, that he may no longer deceive the Nations, and when there shall be nothing to offend in all God's holy Mount.</HI> But when this <HI>dark State</HI> of the Church shall End, or where to fix it's Beginning, is a Matter of Uncertainty, as it seems to have come gradually on. ST. PAUL, indeed tells us, <HI>That the wicked one, whose coming was to be after the Workings of Satan, with all Power, Signs, and lying Wonders, should be revealed, when he that then let or hindered, was taken out of the Way.</HI> By him, that <HI>Let,</HI> the ancient, as well as modern Expositors, un∣derstand, the <HI>Romam Emperor,</HI> who, as long as he held his <HI>Seat</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> prevented the <HI>Pope</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> from deceiving the Nations, with his <HI>lying Wonders.</HI> The ancient <HI>Christians,</HI> therefore used to pray for the Con∣tinuance of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> that the coming of <HI>An∣tichrist</HI> might be delayed. If the Downfal of the <HI>Roman
<PB N="22" REF="007863_0021_102DEB110FE4B5D8"/>
Empire,</HI> may be reckoned from <HI>Rome</HI>'s being sacked, and taken by the Irruptions of the <HI>Northern Nations,</HI> when almost the whole <HI>Empire,</HI> was over-run and divided a∣mong them; when the <HI>ten Horns,</HI> or Kingdoms arose, and gave their Power and Strength to the <HI>Beast;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvii. 12, 13.</NOTE> the Destruction of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> and the End or this <HI>Night</HI> of <HI>Popish</HI> Darkness, is near at Hand; <HI>when he shall be de∣stroyed, by the Breath of</HI> CHIRST'S <HI>Mouth, and the Brightness of his Coming.</HI> But, tho' this <HI>Night</HI> is evi∣dently far spent, and the <HI>Day</HI> draws nigh, yet it appears to me not improbable, that the darkest Part of the <HI>Night</HI> yet remains, and that the <HI>glorious Times,</HI> the Church will enjoy in the <HI>latter Day,</HI> will be preceded with a Sea∣son of the sorest Calamity &amp; Distress. It is the Opinion of many learned Divines, that there will be a general Slaughter of the <HI>Witnesses,</HI> who have thro' all the dark Ages of <HI>Popery,</HI> born a faithful Testimony to the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Ways of Christ,</HI> a little before the <HI>seventh Angel</HI> sounds his Trumpet, for the utter Destruction of <HI>Anti∣christ</HI>'s Kingdom, just when they are about finishing their Testimony, and consequently that this Event is future. But as some eminent Divines, and <HI>One,</HI> for whose Judg∣ment I have the highest Veneration, are of a defferent Opinion, and think it is already past, I shall offer what I have to say on this Head, with all <HI>Humility,</HI> &amp; much <HI>Diffidence</HI> on my own Sentiments, about so dark an E∣vent: The Account we have of it is, <HI>Rev.</HI> xi. 7—13. <HI>And when they shall have finished their Testimony, the Beast that ascends out of the bottomless Pit, shall make War against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them; and their dead Bodies shall lie in the Street of the great City, which spiritually is called</HI> Sodom <HI>&amp;</HI> Egypt, <HI>where also our Lord was crucified. And they of the People, and Kindreds &amp; Tongues, and Nations, shall see their dead Bodies three Days and an Half, and shall not suffer their dead Bodies to be put in Graves. And they
<PB N="23" REF="007863_0022_102DEB1382A85028"/>
that dwell upon the Earth, shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and shall send Gifts one to another; be∣cause these two Prophets tormented them that dwelt on the Earth. And after three Days and an Half, the Spirit of Life from God entered into them: And they stood upon their Feet, and great Fear fell upon them, which saw them. And they heard a great Voice from Heaven, saying unto them, "Come up hither": And they ascended up to Heaven in a Cloud, and their Ene∣mies beheld them.</HI></P>
<P>THE Sum of which Passage seems to be this, <HI>viz.</HI> That when these faithful Witnesses who have so long prophesied in <HI>Sackcloth,</HI> are about concluding their <HI>Testi∣mony,</HI> there will be a severe Persecution raised by the <HI>antichristian</HI> Party; whereby all the faithful Ministers of the Gospel, will appear to be <HI>silenced</HI> or <HI>slain,</HI> and that in the most <HI>public, open,</HI> and <HI>ignominious</HI> Manner, so that their Enemies shall triumph as tho' the Day were their own; but this will continue only for a short Time, <HI>three Days and an Half;</HI> which, if it does not mean <HI>three Years</HI> and an <HI>Half,</HI> taking according to prophetic Stile, a <HI>Day</HI> for a <HI>Year;</HI> yet it doubtless means, that this Time of their Suffering will be but short, compared to the Time of their <HI>prophesying</HI> in <HI>Sackcloth;</HI> it will be but as a Day to a Year, as that is a <HI>Time, Times</HI> &amp; <HI>half a Time,</HI> 1260 <HI>Years.</HI> After this they shall not only be restored to their former Liberty, but exalted to such a State of <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Security,</HI> as they never before en∣joyed, and that in the Presence, and to the Confusion of their Enemies; and the Reasons which have made it ap∣pear to me not improbable that the Church has this dis∣tressing Scene yet to pass thro', are such as these:</P>
<P N="1">1st. IT is to be at the Conclusion of their prophesying in Sackcloth, when they have just finished their Testi∣mony. <HI>When they shall have finished their Testimony.</HI> Thus we translate it, which indeed seems the most natural, genuine Construction of <HI>hotan teles si, cum perfecerint,</HI>
<PB N="24" REF="007863_0023_102DEB15CDC4C3D8"/>
when they have about <HI>compleated</HI> or <HI>finished off their</HI> Testimony, as the original Word properly signifies; at the Close of 1260 Days, when the Period of <HI>Antichrist's Reign</HI> will be just at an End. But, as yet, this Period evidently continues, the faithful Ministers of Christ may, on many Accounts, be said, still to <HI>prophesy</HI> in <HI>Sackcloth,</HI> as the <HI>Mahometan</HI> and <HI>Antichristian</HI> Darkness yet re∣mains, and they are carrying on their Work under great Discouragements.</P>
<P N="2">2d. HISTORY affords no past Events to which the <HI>slaying</HI> and <HI>Resurrection</HI> of the Witnesses, can well be applied. Some learned Men have, I know, endeavoured to find the Accomplishment of it, in sundry <HI>Persecutions,</HI> bro't on the faithful Witnesses for the Truth, none of which seem fully to answer the <HI>prophetic</HI> Description giv∣en of that Event. The <HI>Waldenses</HI> (Followers of <HI>Peter Waldo</HI> a Merchant of <HI>Lyons,</HI> in <HI>France</HI>) <HI>A. D.</HI> 1160, were persecuted with great Severity: 'Tis computed, that not less than 80,000 sealed their Testimony to the <HI>Truths of God</HI> with their Blood. Above a Million of the <HI>Albigenses</HI> (so called from their native Country in <HI>Languedoc</HI>) fell a Sacrifice in the same glorious Cause; but these were of too early a Date to answer the De∣scription; of too long Continuance, and confined to a particular Country; whereas the <HI>slaying of the Witnesses</HI> will be a general Thing; and it is worthy of Remark, that this was in a Country where the Witnesses have al∣most ever since, prophesied in <HI>Sackcloth,</HI> as all acquainted with the <HI>Hostory</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> well know. If they were slain in that Place, it is hard to say, when they rose, or were exalted. Much less can we find this Event accom∣plished, in the short Persecutions by <HI>Queen</HI> MARY, in <HI>England,</HI> or under the <HI>Duke of Savoy,</HI> in <HI>Piedmont,</HI> which were confined to so small a Part of the Church, however exactly they may seem to answer as to the Du∣ration. Many severe Persecutions have been carried on by the <HI>Papists,</HI> against the <HI>Protestants,</HI> in <HI>Hungary,
<PB N="25" REF="007863_0024_102DEB176EDBC9E0"/>
Bohemia,</HI> many Parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> and repeatedly in <HI>France;</HI> but all these were only partial <HI>slaying of the Witnesses.</HI> They were never so universally cut off, as the Prophesy seems to represent.</P>
<P N="3">3d. IT would be difficult to show, that there ever has been that <HI>Resurrection,</HI> and glorious <HI>Exaltation</HI> of the Witnesses, which is to follow immediately after their <HI>lying dead three Days and an Half.</HI> What like this has happened upon any of the Persecutions that have yet been on the Protestant Churches? They are not only to be restored to <HI>Life,</HI> but <HI>to ascend up into Heaven.</HI> i. e. to be exalted to an higher State of <HI>Dignity</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> than they have ever yet enjoyed; and this is to be in a public, open Manner, in the Presence, and to the Con∣fusion of their Enemies. They are to put off their <HI>Sack-cloth,</HI> &amp; put it on no more. The Reproach of their former suffering State, will be wiped away: But the faithful Witnesses of Christ don't seem ever yet to have enjoyed any such State of <HI>Honour, Power, Influence</HI> and <HI>Secu∣rity,</HI> as is here represented. Something indeed, like this, seemed to have happened at the <HI>Reformation,</HI> when many of the first <HI>Reformers</HI> were protected and encouraged in their Work, against the Attempts of their <HI>Popish</HI> Adver∣saries; but when we consider the Opposition they met with, the frequent Persecutions in many Parts of the <HI>Protestant Countries,</HI> the great Discouragements one Way or another, under which the faithful Witnesses of Christ have laboured; we cannot but conclude, that the Time of their <HI>prophesying in Sackcloth yet continues.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4th. THE <HI>second Woe,</HI> does not appear yet to have passed away, nor any such Destruction and Consternation to be brought on the <HI>Seat</HI> of the <HI>Beast,</HI> as is to be at the same Time with the <HI>Slaughter</HI> and Resurrection of the <HI>Witnesses.</HI></P>
<P>IF the <HI>second Woe,</HI> or <HI>Plague</HI> of the Sixth Trumpet, was brought on the Church, by the pouring out of the <HI>fifth Vial, when a Way was prepared for the Kings of

the East;</HI> or, the <HI>Turks</HI> suffered to over-run a con∣siderable Part of <HI>Europe;</HI> or, if it be referred to the Destruction and Darkness brought on many Parts of Christendom, by the <HI>Saracens;</HI> I say, to which soever of these <HI>Events</HI> it is referred, 'tis evident, this Woe bro't by the <HI>Mahometan Imposture,</HI> is not yet passed away, great Part of the World still groaning under it; and it is probable, this Woe is to End with the total Destruction and Abolition of the <HI>Turkish Empire.</HI> Neither does there appear to have been any such <HI>Destruction</HI> and <HI>Revolu∣tion</HI> in the <HI>Antichristian</HI> Dominions, as is represented by the <HI>great Earthquake;</HI> the Destruction of the <HI>Tenth Part of the City,</HI> and <HI>Slaughter of</HI> 7000 <HI>Men of Name;</HI> especially the Time never has yet been, when the Rest were <HI>affrighted, and gave Glory to God.</HI> They have been grieved, vexed and tormented, at the Progress of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> the Liberty granted to the faithful Witnesses; but so far have they been from <HI>repenting, and giving Glory to God,</HI> that, on the Contrary, they have been continually venting their Spite and Malice a∣gainst the <HI>Reformed Churches,</HI> and labouring, by all their hellish Arts, and <HI>popish</HI> Rage, to ruin and destroy them.</P>
<P N="5">5th, IT has been God's usual Method to prepare his Church and People for <HI>extraordinary Favours,</HI> by <HI>ex∣traordinary Trials,</HI> and in the present corrupt State of Things, it seems highly proper that it should be so.</P>
<P>THE Affairs of <HI>Jacob's Family,</HI> are in the most di∣stressed Situation, before he hears that <HI>Joseph</HI> was yet alive, and that by him a Door was open for their Relief. The Children of <HI>Israel</HI> were reduced to the last Ex∣tremity, in their <HI>Egyptian Bondage,</HI> just before their re∣markable Deliverance. When was <HI>David</HI> in a greater Strait than at the Burning of <HI>Ziklag,</HI> a little before he was exalted to the Throne of <HI>Israel?</HI> The Persecution of the Church under the <HI>Emperors of Rome,</HI> was by far the most <HI>extreme</HI> and <HI>dangerous</HI> under <HI>Dioclesian,</HI> when her Deliverance drew nigh, and she was ready to
<PB N="27" REF="007863_0026_102DEB1C2B291E38"/>
be exalted under <HI>Constantine.</HI> The Experience of many Christians can testify, that those <HI>Seasons</HI> in which they have been most highly favoured, with special Commu∣nications of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> have been preceded by re∣markable <HI>Darkness</HI> and <HI>Perplexity.</HI> That he should therefore prepare his Church, for those <HI>glorious Things</HI> spoken of it in the latter Days, by some <HI>extraordinary Trials,</HI> is no improbable Supposition. This Observation will be much strengthened, by considering the present de∣generate State of the <HI>Protestant Churches,</HI> which is such, that it can hardly be expected God should pass by, with∣out some <HI>special Tokens</HI> of his Displeasure.</P>
<P>AND if the <HI>Slaying of the Witnesses</HI> is not yet past, it is probable it may be near at Hand. But however it may be as to that particular <HI>Event,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">The Reasons for supposing this Event already past, are set in a strong and clear Light, in that excellent Treatise. <HI>An humble Attempt to promote extraordinary Prayer for the Revival of Religion;</HI> which I had not by me when I wrote this Dis∣course, but on a Review of it since, find that such a Season of Trials, as I suppose the present degenerate State of the Church requires, may be expected on the Author's Scheme that the Witnesses are slain; for he says, Pag. 125, <Q>'Tis true there is abundant Evidence in Scripture, that there is yet remaining a mighty Conflict between the Church and her Enemies, the most violent Struggle of <HI>Satan</HI> and his Adherents, in Opposition to true Religion, &amp;c. And some Parts of the Church may suffer hard Things in this Conflict.</Q></NOTE> about which I would be far from making any positive Conclusions; many Things may make us expect that <HI>difficult</HI> and <HI>trying</HI> Times are coming on the <HI>Church</HI> and the <HI>World.</HI> The dark Cloud that gathers so fast over our <HI>Nation</HI> and <HI>Land,</HI> seems to forebode Distress and Calamity, to the <HI>Protestant Churches</HI> in general. The <HI>British Nation</HI> has been for a long Time the great <HI>Bulwark</HI> of the <HI>Re∣formation,</HI> and should it be subdued, the other <HI>Protestant Powers in Europe</HI> could, by no Means, be a Match for their <HI>antichristian Enemies,</HI> when united together; and
<PB N="28" REF="007863_0027_102DEB1E58D519F8"/>
a Door would open for a distressing Scene of Persecu∣tion, throughout all the <HI>reformed Churches:</HI> It gives me no Pleasure to be a Messenger of evil Tidings, nor would I make positive Assertions about <HI>future Events;</HI> yet I must say, our publick Affairs wear a dark Aspect. The Nation we are engaged with in War, is numerous, powerful and politic. <HI>France</HI> abounds with Men, and the <HI>King</HI> commands as many as he pleases into the Field; on every Occasion shows himself superior to our Expectations; and his being an absolute Monarch gives great Advantage in Point of Secrecy and Dispatch.</P>
<P>OUR old Friend and Ally, the <HI>Queen</HI> of <HI>Hungary,</HI> has joined the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>France,</HI> and so far as we can judge from her Conduct, designs to forsake us, whatever plausible Pretences, she may make to the Contra∣ry. No other Construction can be put on her joining our <HI>sworn Enemy,</HI> when at open War with us, in the Manner she has done; No Power in <HI>Europe,</HI> under greater Obligations to the <HI>British</HI> Nation; almost all the Wars we have been engaged in, since the Accession of King <HI>William,</HI> have been undertaken in Favour of the <HI>House</HI> of <HI>Austria. Louishourg,</HI> that important <HI>Fortress,</HI> was given up, that the Places the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>France</HI> had taken from her in <HI>Flanders,</HI> might be restored; yet now she has forsaken us at a critical Juncture; and what may we then expect from other <HI>Popish</HI> Powers. <HI>Spain</HI> ap∣pears waiting for nothing but a favourable Opportunity of declaring against us. The <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Poland,</HI> (Elector of Saxony) by a strange Turn of <HI>Politics,</HI> seems in∣clined to espouse the Interest of <HI>France.</HI> The Connec∣tions of the <HI>King</HI> of the <HI>two Sicilies</HI> are such, that he will readily join their Confederacy: And perhaps the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Sardinia,</HI> will be obliged to <HI>join</HI> or stand <HI>neuter,</HI> in his own Defence. When to this, we add the <HI>Coldness,</HI> to say no worse with which we are treated by some of our <HI>Protestant Allies;</HI> it gives the Situation of our publick Affairs a <HI>dangerous and threatning</HI> Aspect.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="007863_0028_102DEB200120C5C8"/>And if we cast our Eyes on the <HI>British Colonies</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> Things look still darker. All our Schemes hitherto prove unsuccessful; our <HI>Enemies,</HI> small and contemptible as their Numbers appeared to us, every where get the Advantage. <HI>Braddock's</HI> mournful De∣feat last Year, has been attended with a <HI>Train</HI> of destructive Consequences. 'Tis not easy to conceive, what we have suffered from the <HI>barbarous Natives,</HI> under the <HI>Influence,</HI> and by the Assistance of the <HI>French;</HI> scarce a Paper from the <HI>Southward</HI> but brings Accounts of new <HI>Depredations</HI> &amp; <HI>Murders.</HI> What ruinous Consequen∣ces may we expect from the <HI>Loss</HI> of <HI>Oswego?</HI> What an Advantage is hereby put into the Enemy's Hand; the Lake wholly at their Command, where we have expend∣ed such Sums. Our <HI>Shipping, Artillery,</HI> with the other Warlike <HI>Stores</HI> and <HI>Provisions,</HI> which we had conveyed there with great Cost and Labour; all fallen into the <HI>Hands</HI> of the Enemy, to be employed against us. All the <HI>fine Country</HI> adjacent, lost; and the few <HI>Indians,</HI> that have hitherto continued in our <HI>Friendship,</HI> will probably forsake us; and those that have remained neuter, join in with the Enemy; for now seems verified the Observa∣tion they made in a late Treaty at <HI>Albany,</HI> <Q>The <HI>French</HI> act like <HI>Men,</HI> build Forts and defend them; but the <HI>English</HI> act like <HI>Women.</HI></Q></P>
<P>DARK Tidings of late, like <HI>Job</HI>'s Messengers, come in thick Succession, one after another. In the Midst of our Lamentations for the sad Fate of <HI>Oswego,</HI> comes the melancholly News, of <HI>Port-Mahon</HI>'s being taken: The Loss of a <HI>Fortress</HI> so important, of such Consequence to the <HI>British Trade,</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and which gives so much Advantage to the Enemy, must be exceeding great, highly aggravated by the disgraceful Circumstan∣ces which attended it; the Ferment into which it has thrown the Nation, and the lasting Dishonour done to the <HI>British Flag.</HI> I shall leave it to the <HI>Politicians</HI> of the Day, to point out the Cause of those sore Calami∣ties,
<PB N="30" REF="007863_0029_102DEB21A75BF550"/>
and make but one Remark, which must be obvious to all serious and thinking Persons.</P>
<P>THAT our Misfortunes have come upon us, in such a Manner, as plainly to point out the <HI>Hand of God</HI> there∣in; and shows us, that our Dependance on our own <HI>Wis∣dom</HI> &amp; <HI>Strength,</HI> while by our Sins, we engage Heaven against us, is as <HI>vain</HI> as it is <HI>sinful</HI> — We have been great∣ly disposed to boast of our superior Strength by <HI>Sea,</HI> and glory in our <HI>Fleets,</HI> as a sure <HI>Refuge</HI> in a Time of Danger; but even <HI>they</HI> have failed us, and at a Sea∣son, when we most needed their Help, and seemed to have the highest Reason of Dependance upon them. This might serve to cure us of our <HI>Infidelity</HI> and vain <HI>Confi∣dence,</HI> and teach us our entire <HI>Dependence</HI> on <HI>God,</HI> and how great our Danger is, while his <HI>Hand</HI> is so evidently stretched forth against us. Our Expedition to <HI>Crown Point,</HI> will probably again, like the Rest of our Schemes, prove abortive. These Things, together with our <HI>di∣vided Councils,</HI> and <HI>dilatory Methods</HI> of Proceeding, make the Situation of public Affairs, look exceeding dan∣gerous, and may well alarm our Fears, as to what is com∣ing on our <HI>Nation,</HI> and <HI>Country.</HI>—And if we consider the present State of the <HI>Protestant Churches,</HI> will it not tend to increase our dark Apprehensions on this Head? What mournful Declensions, as to <HI>Doctrine, Dis∣cipline,</HI> and <HI>practical Godliness!</HI> God has evidently withdrawn his Spirit;—a sad Decay, as to <HI>vital Piety,</HI> is almost every where lamentably visible;—A Midnight Security seems to have fallen on the Churches;— Both Ministers and People, Saints and Sinners, <HI>slumber</HI> and <HI>sleep. Iniquity abounds; the Love of many waxes cold.</HI>—Lukewarmness and Indifference, in spiritual and divine Things; Want of Affection to <HI>God</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> to the <HI>Truths</HI> and <HI>Ordinances</HI> of the Gospel, are growing fast on the Professors of this <HI>Age. The Things that remain are just ready to die, and our Works are not found perfect before God.—The</HI> Gospel, and
<PB N="31" REF="007863_0030_102DEB2409FC3E70"/>
all its Glories, grow more and more contemptible in the Eyes of <HI>Sinners</HI> and less precious in the Eyes of <HI>Saints.</HI>— The Lord's-Day, public Worship, and Ordi∣nances of his House, disregarded and slighted;—The Ministers of the Gospel treated with Contempt by many, with too much Neglect and Disregard by all; their <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Families</HI> poorly supported, their <HI>Character</HI> and <HI>Office</HI> little reverenced, and the <HI>important Messages</HI> they bring, undervalued and rejected. How widely different are Things in this Respect, from what they were in the Memory of many now alive! How little of that Re∣verence and Esteem for the <HI>ministerial Character,</HI> which was so remarkable among our <HI>Fore-fathers,</HI> is to be seen in our Day; and these Things are waxing worse and worse. Whether this arises from Declensions among <HI>Ministers</HI> or <HI>People,</HI> or both, it must be esteem∣ed a <HI>dark Symptom</HI> on the Church. Time would fail me, to speak of the mournful Growth of Infidelity, Profaneness, and all kind of abominable Immoralities: And when we consider these Things, have we not Reason to fear, that God will purify his <HI>Churches</HI> in the <HI>Furnace,</HI> that they may come forth as <HI>Gold tried</HI> and <HI>refined?</HI> Can we expect, that so much <HI>Dross</HI> and <HI>Corruption,</HI> as is now found among us, will be purg∣ed off any other Way? The <HI>Popish</HI> Powers may be suffered to unite their Strength, to prevail, and carry all before them for a <HI>Season;</HI> to <HI>slay,</HI> or <HI>silence</HI> the faithful <HI>Witnesses</HI> of Christ; to <HI>rejoyce,</HI> and <HI>send Gifts,</HI> as if the Day was their own, and to imagine they have Nothing to fear from them, who used <HI>to torment them Day and Night.</HI> This, as it will be the last Effort of the <HI>Man</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> and his Adherents, may, probably, be one of the most <HI>desperate Attacks,</HI> he has ever made on the <HI>Re∣formed Churches. Satan</HI> will seem to be loosed from the <HI>bottomless Pit,</HI> and will come in great Wrath, because his Time is short. But, blessed be God, tho' this will be a Time of <HI>great Darkness &amp; Distress,</HI> yet it will soon be

over. The triumphing of the Enemies of Christ, will be short. When they think themselves most secure, and that there are none to oppose their Designs, <HI>sudden Destruction shall come upon them, as on a Woman in Travail, and they shall not escape.</HI> When the <HI>Whore</HI> of <HI>Babylon,</HI> or <HI>mystical Rome,</HI> shall say, <HI>I sit as a Queen, am no Widow,</HI> and <HI>shall see no Sorrow;</HI> then her Doom draws nigh; <HI>her Plagues shall come in one Day; Death, Mourning &amp; Famine; and she shall be utterly burnt with Fire</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. xviii, 7, 8.</NOTE>. Happy shall they then be, <HI>who have come out from her, and are not Partakers of her Sin, that they may not receive of her Plagues.</HI> The Destruction of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> will not be at once; yet on the <HI>Resurrection</HI> and <HI>Exaltation</HI> of the Witnesses, he shall receive a <HI>deadly Wound,</HI> of which he shall never be healed, but consume away by the <HI>Breath of Christ's Mouth, and Brightness of his Coming.</HI> Such sudden and awful Judgments will then be brought upon <HI>him,</HI> as shall affrighten the <HI>Rest</HI> of the World, and cause them to <HI>give Glory to God.</HI> This, with the passing away of the <HI>second Woe,</HI> in the Over∣throw of the <HI>Turkish Empire,</HI> will open a Door for that <HI>glorious Spread</HI> of the Gospel promised in the <HI>latter Days.</HI> The <HI>third Woe</HI> under the sounding of the seventh Angel, which cometh quickly, will issue in the final and complete <HI>Destruction</HI> of <HI>Antichrist,</HI> and <HI>Confusion</HI> of all the implacable Enemies of the Church.

<P>CHRISTIANS, in general, will be favoured with un∣usual Communications of divine Grace, and <HI>shine as Lights in the World.</HI> There will be something con∣vincing and alluring in their <HI>Example:</HI> That mean, low, sordid <HI>Temper,</HI> that contentious, jangling, quarrel∣some Spirit, which now appears in most <HI>Professors,</HI> ob∣scures the Beauty of our <HI>holy Religion</HI> in the Eyes of Strangers, and is one of the greatest <HI>Obstacles</HI> to the Spread of the <HI>Gospel.</HI> But when <HI>true Religion</HI> comes to be properly exemplified in the Lives of <HI>Christians,</HI> there will appear such a Charm, and <HI>Excellency</HI> in it, as will strike and allure the <HI>Beholders,</HI> and have a peculiar Tendency to propagate it throughout the <HI>World.</HI></P>
<P>FAMILIES will then, 'tis probable, be as remarkable for being <HI>Nurseries of Piety,</HI> as they now are for being Scenes of <HI>Disorder, Corruption,</HI> and <HI>Vice;</HI> when <HI>Chil∣dren</HI> will indeed be <HI>trained up for God,</HI> and come on the Stange of Action with Hearts animated with Love to <HI>him,</HI> and to all <HI>Mankind,</HI> and glowing Desires of be∣ing distinguished Blessings in their Day.</P>
<P>PUBLICK SCHOOLS, and <HI>Seminaries of Learning,</HI> will probably become Seats remarkable for <HI>Virtue,</HI> and <HI>true Religion;</HI> where it shall shine with divine <HI>Lustre,</HI> and diffuse its benign <HI>Influence</HI> far and wide: From those <HI>Fountains</HI> thus purified, will issue <HI>Streams</HI> that shall make <HI>glad the City of our God.</HI> I hint at these Things, as probable <HI>Means</HI> whereby the glorious De∣signs of God's Grace will be carried on, in the <HI>latter Day,</HI> that with our fervent <HI>Prayer,</HI> we may untite our earnest Endeavours for their Accomplishment.</P>
<P>WHAT a <HI>glorious Change</HI> will soon be produced, when God shall visit these dark Abodes, with such plen∣tiful

Effusions of his Spirit! What a new Face of Things must then appear in the <HI>moral World. Behold I cre∣ate a new Heaven, and a new Earth; be ye glad, and rejoice, for ever, in what I create, for I create Jerusalem a Rejoicing, and her People a Joy</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. lv. 17, 18.</NOTE>. My Heart is inlarged on this delightful Subject, but having greatly transgressed my Bounds, I must conclude with a very brief Address, to <HI>My Reverend and dear Brethren,</HI> in the Gospel, who are convened on the present Occasion.</P>
<P N="1">1st. LET us prepare for <HI>dark</HI> and <HI>distressing Times,</HI> if God should see fit to bring them on the <HI>Church</HI> in our Day.</P>
<P>THO' it be not for us to know the <HI>Times</HI> and <HI>Sea∣sons</HI> which <HI>God</HI> has reserved in his own <HI>Power;</HI> yet when he is both by his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Providence,</HI> giving Intimations of approaching Judgments, we ought, like <HI>Noah,</HI> to be <HI>moved with Fear,</HI> and prepare to meet them. This may especially be expected of us, who are appointed as <HI>Watchmen,</HI> to give warning to others. Tho' we can't pretend to penetrate into the <HI>Council of Heaven,</HI> as to future Events, yet <HI>he that runs, may read</HI> the present threatning <HI>Aspect</HI> of divine Providence; the <HI>loud Calls</HI> God is giving to the <HI>World,</HI> and to his <HI>Churches,</HI> to prepare to meet him: He speaks once; yea, twice; and that in a most solemn &amp; moving Man∣ner; tho' few regard him. The <HI>Cloud</HI> gathers thick and dark upon us; our <HI>Nation</HI> and <HI>Land,</HI> filled with Sin against the <HI>holy one of Israel;</HI> challenging God to vindicate the Honour of his Majesty;—engaged in War with an <HI>ambitious, politic</HI> &amp; <HI>warlike</HI> Nation, strengthned by a powerful Confederacy,—a Nation that has long been <HI>drunk with the Blood of the Saints;</HI>—our <HI>Coun∣cils</HI> and divided Schemes, turned into <HI>Foolishness;</HI> our vain Boastings and groundless Expectations, repeatedly disappointed. Have we not then Reason to tremble, for Fear of those Things that are coming upon us?
<PB N="38" REF="007863_0037_102DEB3353E5E710"/>
Should our <HI>Enemies,</HI> enraged as they have been, and flush'd with <HI>Victory</HI> as they now are, be suffered to prevail, and put in Execution their wicked Designs, to fill with <HI>Desolation</HI> and <HI>Woe,</HI> with the direful Effects of <HI>popish Bigotry,</HI> &amp; <HI>lawless Tyranny,</HI> this once happy <HI>Land,</HI> which has so long been distinguished with <HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Plenty,</HI> with Gospel <HI>Light and Liberty;</HI> what a <HI>lamentable Scene</HI> would it open! and what can we ex∣pect, but that <HI>Judgment will begin at the House of God.</HI> The <HI>Watchmen</HI> will doubtless first be attacked;—the <HI>Shepherd smiteen, that the Sheep may be scattered.</HI> What are we better than our Fathers? than the glorious Train of <HI>Martyrs,</HI> who have <HI>sealed their Testimony with their Blood;</HI> and why should we expect to die quietly in our Nests? And are we, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> pre∣pared for such <HI>trying Times</HI> as may soon come upon us? Is <HI>Christ,</HI> his <HI>Truths,</HI> and <HI>Ways,</HI> dearer to us, than our <HI>Lives?</HI> And can we freely sacrifice the <HI>latter</HI> in De∣fence of the <HI>former?</HI> Should we who are <HI>Leaders</HI> in Christ's Army, give back, and cowardly <HI>desert</HI> the <HI>glo∣rious Cause</HI> wherewith we are entrusted, our Guilt and Condemnation would be exceeding great. This would be to <HI>crucify the Lord afresh, and put him to open Shame,</HI> and for such there <HI>remains no more Sacrifice for Sin, but a certain looking for of Judgment, and fiery Indignation.</HI></P>
<P>WE may, perhaps, in a warm Mood, like <HI>Peter</HI> say, <HI>Tho' all Men forsake thee, yet will not we.</HI> But have we that <HI>Self-denial, Faith</HI> and <HI>Love,</HI> that would carry us thro' the <HI>fiery Trial,</HI> bear us up under all the Variety of <HI>Tortures,</HI> which the Wit and Malice of our Enemies may invent? It must be <HI>Love, stronger than Death,</HI> such as <HI>many Waters cannot quench.</HI> We are loudly called in this Day, to <HI>stand with our Loins girt,</HI> and <HI>Lamps burning;</HI> to have, all our Graces, in a lively vigorous Exercise; our Evidences for Heaven clear, that we may be ready, if the <HI>Lord</HI> should come as a

<HI>Refiner's Fire,</HI> and <HI>Fuller's Soap, to purify the Sons of Levi</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. iii. 2, 3.</NOTE>. Let us continually <HI>look to the Author &amp; Fi∣nisher of our Faith,</HI> and be animated cheerfully to <HI>suffer</HI> with him here, under the glorious Prospect that we shall <HI>reign</HI> with him for ever.</P>
<P N="2">2d. WITH what Pleasure should we look forward to the joyful Period, when <HI>the Kingdoms of this World shall become the Kingdoms of our Lord, &amp; of his Christ;</HI> and how ardently should we long and pray, for the Ap∣proach of it?</P>
<P>THO' many <HI>Trials</HI> may yet await us, and we should be call'd off from the Stage, before the <HI>Darkness</HI> of the present <HI>Night</HI> be past; yet it must be a delightful Tho't, that the <HI>Morning cometh,</HI> and will usher in a <HI>glorious Day</HI> to the Church, when the <HI>Cause</HI> of Truth and Ho∣liness, Peace and Purity, shall universally prevail, in Opposition to all the Heresy and Wickedness, Tumults and Corruptions, which have hitherto overspread the Earth; when the Prayers of the Saints in all Ages, for the <HI>Prosperity</HI> of Zion, shall be answered, and the <HI>glo∣rious Things</HI> spoken of her in the sacred Oracles, be fully accomplished.</P>
<P>WE, indeed, may be laid in the silent Dust, before this <HI>blessed Day</HI> appears; but we can now behold it, as <HI>Abraham</HI> saw the <HI>Day</HI> of Christ; and if we are pos∣sessed of the same <HI>excellent Spirit,</HI> shall rejoice and be exceeding glad. An Heart touched with a dutiful Sense of God's Honour and Interest, can't but be pleased, that he will be highly glorified in this <HI>apostate World,</HI> where he has been insolently affronted, and provoked, for so long a Time: Such must feel some peculiar E∣motions of Joy. While some say with the <HI>Psalmist,</HI> in Faith, <HI>be thou exalted, O! God, above the Hea∣vens, and thy Glory above all the Earth</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Psalm cviii. 5.</NOTE>. To a Soul animated with unfeigned Love to, and zealous Concern for, the <HI>Cause</HI> and <HI>Kingdom</HI> of the dear Re∣deemer,
<PB N="40" REF="007863_0039_102DEB379596D718"/>
how delightful the Prospect!—that he will <HI>one Day,</HI> have the greatest Interest in the Hearts of Men; <HI>take to himself Power, and Reign from</HI> Land to Land, and Sea to Sea; that his <HI>blessed Gospel,</HI> which is now treated with Scorn and Contempt, by lost and perishing Sinners, shall triumph over all the Opposition of Earth and Hell, have free <HI>Course and be glorified, throughout the World.</HI></P>
<P>O! WHAT a refreshing, what a reviving Thought! that these <HI>Regions</HI> of Darkness, Guilt and Misery, shall be filled with spiritual Light, Life and Joy. The pre∣sent <HI>languishing State</HI> of true Religion, is, indeed, dis∣tressing; and the more so, when we consider, that it may possibly continue to the End of our Lives: But how pleasing the Contemplation, that it will certainly be <HI>revived,</HI> and <HI>flourish,</HI> tho' among future Generati∣ons; that God shall be served and glorified, by our <HI>Posterity,</HI> in a far better Manner than he has ever been by us. And <HI>that a People which shall be created, shall praise the Lord</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm cii. 18.</NOTE>. This may solace us, under the <HI>near Views</HI> of approaching Death, if, with good old <HI>Jacob,</HI> we can say to our Children, <HI>We die, but the Lord will be with you</HI> <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Gen, xlviii. 21,</NOTE>. As a believing View of <HI>Zion</HI>'s further <HI>Prosperity</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> should support and comfort us, under our present <HI>Labours</HI> and <HI>Trials;</HI> so it should enlarge our Hearts, in constant, fervent Supplications to the Throne of Grace, that it may be accomplished. The Representation I have given, of the <HI>exceeding</HI> cor∣rupt and degenerate State of the Church, with other dark Prospects in the <HI>present Day,</HI> should be so far from discouraging, that it should greatly enliven and animate our Prayers; partly, as it tends to give us an affecting <HI>Sense</HI> of our entire <HI>Dependance</HI> on God, for so great a Mercy; and the utter <HI>Insufficiency</HI> of all Means for the Revival, and general Spread of <HI>true Religion</HI> in the World, without a plentiful Effusion of the divine Spirit:
<PB N="41" REF="007863_0040_102DEB3A550D2518"/>
And, partly, because Infidelity and Wickedness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> arrived to so great an <HI>Height,</HI> and Religion is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to so low an Ebb, that it seems as if <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> come to the <HI>last Extremity,</HI> and that it was a fit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> God to appear, and display the Greatness of his Power, Love and Faithfulness, to his Church, to convince the World, that the <HI>Gates of Hell shall not prevail against her.</HI> In∣stead therefore of desponding, under the present <HI>gloomy Appearance</HI> of Things, let us be awakned to greater <HI>Fervency</HI> in Prayer, and look forward with more <HI>earnest</HI> Expectations, for the <HI>Dawn</HI> of that <HI>glorious Day,</HI> when <HI>the whole Earth shall be filled with the Knowledge of the Lord.</HI> And tho' he should come <HI>as a Refiner's Fire,</HI> to purge and purify his Churches, in the Furnace of Af∣fliction, yet let us, with united Hearts, say, <HI>Come Lord Jesus; come quickly.</HI></P>
<P>FINALLY, Let us be <HI>awakned</HI> in this dark and difficult Day, to a faithful zealous <HI>Discharge</HI> of the Duties of our Stations. It would be sad indeed, if, at such a time, we should <HI>do the Work of the Lord carelesly and deceitfully;</HI> if by our <HI>Sloth</HI> and <HI>Negligence,</HI> we should increase the deplorable <HI>Darkness</HI> and <HI>Dead∣ness,</HI> which is already on the <HI>Churches,</HI> and suffer the Cause of God to <HI>die</HI> in our Hands. We have every Motive to awaken our <HI>Zeal,</HI> and quicken our <HI>Dili∣gence,</HI> in our great Work. What we find to do for <HI>God,</HI> the <HI>Souls</HI> of our Hearers, and our bleeding <HI>Coun∣try,</HI> we should, in such a Day as this, <HI>do with al our Might.</HI> Allow me in Particular, to press the <HI>Necessity</HI> and <HI>Importance</HI> of uniting our most vigorous Attempts for a thorough and general <HI>Reformation.</HI> This is what we proposed in our <HI>Judicatory,</HI> and to which we <HI>unani∣mously agreed,</HI> viz. That we would not only <HI>explain, and warmly press in our public Discourses, the Neces∣sity of a Reformation, but exert ourselves in our several Spheres of Influence, to bring it about.</HI> This is what God is most evidently and loudly <HI>calling</HI> us to, in the
<PB N="42" REF="007863_0041_102DEB3C91F71348"/>
present Day. He has of late been giving extraordinary <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> of impending Judgments, by mighty <HI>Winds,</HI> praeter<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <HI>Inundations,</HI> and terrible <HI>Earthquakes in divers places.</HI> The Frame of Nature seems to have been cast into a trembling Disorder, at the Approach of an <HI>angry God,</HI> and as it were in Astonishment, solemnly to call on the Inhabitants of a guilty World, to <HI>repent,</HI> and <HI>return,</HI> before his Wrath comes upon them to the utmost. The Displeasure of Heaven has been once and again testified against our <HI>Nation</HI> and <HI>Land.</HI> We have felt the <HI>Rebukes</HI> of an incensed Deity. The <HI>Cause</HI> of all which Calamities, is notorious and evident to all, who have any due <HI>Sense</HI> of God on their Minds, or be∣lieve that he <HI>rules among the Children of Men.</HI> God is openly and publickly <HI>affronted;</HI>—his <HI>Name</HI> used and prophaned, in the most <HI>atheistical</HI> Manner;—his <HI>Laws</HI> vi∣olated;—his <HI>Authority</HI> despised; —the loud <HI>Calls</HI> of his <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Providence</HI> disregarded;—and all the Riches of his <HI>Grace,</HI> in the Gospel, slighted;—while <HI>Profanity</HI> and <HI>Infidelity, Luxury</HI> &amp; <HI>Debauchery, Pride</HI> and <HI>Oppression,</HI> reign without Controul, among those that make no Pretensions to Religion. <HI>Decays</HI> in Faith, Love and Zeal, a <HI>Conformity</HI> to the World, and <HI>Dead∣ness</HI> to spiritual and divine Things, are visible, and la∣mentable, among its <HI>Professors.</HI> These Things have kindled the <HI>Anger</HI> of Heaven against us, and it is <HI>not turned away;</HI> but his avenging <HI>Hand is stretched out still. And shall not God punish for these Things? Will he not be avenged on such a People as this?</HI> Can we expect, that all the <HI>public Contempt</HI> thrown on his Authority and Government, will be passed by without Tokens of his <HI>angry Resentment,</HI> unless Repentance and Reformation prevent.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that I have not been backward in using the little Influence I have, in animating my <HI>Coun∣try-men,</HI> to a vigorous Defence of their <HI>Lives</HI> and <HI>Liber∣ties,</HI> in the use of all proper Means; and I wish it were
<PB N="43" REF="007863_0042_102DEB3E35A35E78"/>
in my Power, to awake in them a greater <HI>Sense</HI> of the Necessity of being alive, and thoroughly engaged in this <HI>Matter.</HI> But I must freely declare, I have no Expec∣tations of Safety to the <HI>Nation</HI> or <HI>Land,</HI> from any of our <HI>Preparations,</HI> till a Sense of our <HI>Dependance</HI> on God, and a Disposition to return to him by <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation,</HI> prevails. The <HI>Judgments</HI> of Hea∣ven are manifestly on us; but who lays it to <HI>Heart?</HI> Who suitably <HI>regards the Works of the Lord, and the Operations of his Hand?</HI> We can discern, or imagine we discern, the Cause of our <HI>Calamities,</HI> in the <HI>Weak∣ness of one,</HI> the <HI>Cowardice</HI> of another, and the <HI>Treachery</HI> of a third, whilst the <HI>procuring Cause</HI> of all is <HI>overlooked</HI> and <HI>forgot.</HI> That our Danger is <HI>great,</HI> and <HI>near,</HI> is acknowledged by all; but where do we look for Deliverance? Is it not to our victorious <HI>Fleets?</HI>— the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of our Commanders?—the <HI>Number</HI> and <HI>Bravery</HI> of our Men? Our mournful Disappointments, instead of <HI>curing,</HI> do but <HI>increase</HI> our Infidelity and Folly. We can see the Error or our <HI>last Scheme,</HI> and determine to rectify it in the next; almost every one imagines, he could conduct Matters better, and point out a Way of Safety, if he was at the Head of Affairs; but forgets, that <HI>the Race is not to the Swift, nor the Battle to the Strong.</HI> The <HI>Hand of God</HI> is disregar∣ded;—no suitable Pains taken, to remove the Cause of his awful Displeasure against us. But till there be some public, visible <HI>Humiliation</HI> for, and <HI>Reformation</HI> of, those open Abominations, which cry to Heaven for Vengeance; we need not think it strange, if God should send such a <HI>Spirit of Confusion</HI> into all our Councils; — suffer such cross <HI>Interests,</HI> mutual <HI>Jealousies</HI> &amp; <HI>Distrust;</HI> such <HI>Divisions</HI> &amp; <HI>Perplexities,</HI> to prevail in our Schemes, as naturally tend to <HI>defeat</HI> all our Attempts, and bring about our <HI>Ruin.</HI> Should this, I say, befal us, it would be no strange Thing; 'tis no more than what has fre∣quently
<PB N="44" REF="007863_0043_102DEB406C041CB8"/>
happened to <HI>sinful, impenitent</HI> People;—no more than what we have Reason to expect, if <HI>Repen∣tance</HI> prevent not <NOTE N="§." PLACE="foot">Isai. lx. 12.</NOTE>. We, <HI>My Brethren,</HI> who are set on the <HI>Walls of God's Jerusalem,</HI> to give <HI>Warning</HI> of approaching Danger, can't but see the Necessity of <HI>Re∣pentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation,</HI> to avert impending Judg∣ments; and surely it concerns us, to join in with the <HI>alarming Calls</HI> of divine Providence, and endeavour to awaken in all around us, a Sense of these Things. The Eyes of <HI>God, Angels</HI> and <HI>Men,</HI> are upon us, to ob∣serve our Conduct in this <HI>Day</HI> of publick Calamity and Distress. From <HI>us,</HI> the beginning and carrying on, this so <HI>necessary a Work,</HI> is justly expected, whose Obliga∣tions to, and Advantages for it, are great and distingush∣ing.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Glory</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> the <HI>Interest</HI> of Religion; the <HI>Welfare</HI> of our bleeding Country, and the <HI>solemn Ac∣count</HI> we must soon give to our <HI>Judge,</HI> call for our diligent <HI>Activity</HI> &amp; <HI>Zeal,</HI> in this Matter, as well as our own <HI>public voluntary Agreement,</HI> that we would unite our <HI>Endea∣vours,</HI> &amp; exert our <HI>Influence</HI> in our several Stations, for this Purpose; in which we humbly hope, &amp; earnestly desire, that we may be joined by our <HI>Brethren</HI> of every Deno∣mination throughout the <HI>Land.</HI> The Example and Advice of those of the <HI>sacred Character,</HI> we might rea∣sonably expect, would animate <HI>Magistrates,</HI> and <HI>Heads of Families,</HI> to engage in the same <HI>laudable Design,</HI> prove the Means of bringing about the so much needed, and wish'd for <HI>Reformation,</HI> and so of saving a sinning <HI>Land,</HI> from deserved impending <HI>Ruin.</HI> Let our At∣tempts for this Purpose, according to <HI>our Proposal</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Synod agreed to recommend it to their Congre∣gations, to spend a Part of the last Thursday of every Month, in extraordinary Prayer to God, on Account of the distressed Situation of our public Affairs.</NOTE>, be accompanied with extraordinary <HI>Prayer</HI> to God, who

has the <HI>Hearts</HI> of all Men in his Hand; and to this we may be excited and encouraged, by a Variety of Mo∣tives; and in particular, from a Prospect of being join∣ed by many in several Parts of the Land. Our <HI>Bre∣thren,</HI> in some Parts of <HI>New-England,</HI> have set us a laudable Example, in this Respect, and I hope their <HI>Zeal</HI> and <HI>Forwardness,</HI> will provoke very many; aad now God begins to pour out a <HI>Spirit of Prayer</HI> and <HI>Supplication,</HI> of <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation,</HI> on Mi∣nisters and People <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">While I was transcribing this Part of my Discourse, received some encouraging Accounts of this Kind.</NOTE>, we ought to esteem it a <HI>Token for Good;</HI>—it should animate our Prayers;—<HI>envigorate</HI> our Hopes;—and <HI>enliven</HI> all our Attempts for the Safety and Deliverance of our <HI>Country.</HI> And while we are opening to our People a <HI>dark Scene,</HI> from the crying <HI>Sins,</HI> and distressing <HI>Calamities</HI> of the Day, to alarm and arouse them from their Security and vain Confi∣dence; I trust we shall not fail to animate them to a <HI>vigorous Defence</HI> of their Lives and Properties, by set∣ting before them all the Horrors of <HI>Popery, Slavery</HI> and <HI>Death,</HI> which may follow the <HI>victorious Arms</HI> of our antichristian Foes, on the <HI>one Hand;</HI> and on <HI>the other,</HI> all the invaluable <HI>Priviledges</HI> of unadulterated <HI>Christi∣anity; British Liberty</HI> and <HI>Property,</HI> in a delightful and fruitful <HI>Country,</HI> which may be the happy Conse∣quences of our <HI>vigorously exerting</HI> our selves to bring them to <HI>honourable Terms of Peace.—Priviledges</HI> of infinite Value! for which we should bravely resolve, to spend our last <HI>Breath,</HI> in Prayer; the last <HI>Penny</HI> of our Estates, and the last <HI>Drop</HI> of our Blood.

that illustrious Family, which has so long been distinguish∣ed for their warm Attachment <HI>to,</HI> and Zeal <HI>for,</HI> the <HI>Re∣ligion</HI> and <HI>Liberties</HI> of their Country.

<P>ADN should the several <HI>Colonies</HI> harmoniously unite, to strengthen his Hands, and nobly exert themselves in the <HI>common Cause,</HI> he might be, <HI>under God,</HI> a happy <HI>Instrument</HI> of retrieving our shameful <HI>Losses,</HI> of hum∣bling our ambitious triumphing <HI>Foes,</HI> and restoring Peace and Tranquility to this bleeding <HI>Land.</HI> Which, may GOD, of his infinite Mercy, grant, thro' JESUS CHRIST, our LORD, <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
