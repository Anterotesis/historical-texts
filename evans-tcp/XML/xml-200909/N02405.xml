<HEAD><HI>TO THE</HI> Loyal Protestant READER.</HEAD>
<P>IF I had not been perswaded that the <HI>Text,</HI> and and this short <HI>Discourse</HI> upon it here presented to thee, breaths the heart and soul of the <HI>Churches in New-England,</HI> both <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>People,</HI> I should not have bro't the <HI>one</HI> into the <HI>pulpit</HI> upon the present <HI>occasion,</HI> nor have permitted the <HI>other</HI> to go into the <HI>press</HI> at the <HI>desire</HI> of those who heard it. But as I am <HI>conscious</HI> of no motive in the choice of the Subject, but I trust a sincere and fervent zeal for the Religion of <HI>Christ</HI> and the <HI>Protestant Succession</HI> in the Royal Family; so I am <HI>confident</HI> that the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> who have asked this <HI>copy</HI> of what they heard, did it on no other <HI>mo∣tive.</HI> And if it may in any measure help to con∣firm and increase a dutiful and loyal affection to CHRIST, his truths and spiritual worship; and to our rightful <HI>King</HI> as the <HI>Defender</HI> of them; I shall not repent the making so <HI>minute</HI> an offering at the <HI>Temple</HI> on so <HI>great</HI> an Occasion.</P>
<P>The Name of the great <HI>King William</HI> was ever dear to these his loyal <HI>New-English Colonies,</HI> and that beyond expression; but there is no <HI>one</HI> thing
<PB N="ii" REF="002852_0004_0FE677ACE6618020"/>by which his Immortal Memory is more endear'd to us, than the wise and just <HI>provision</HI> by Him made for the <HI>Succession of the Crown in the Pro∣testant Line.</HI></P>
<P>When we saw it take place in a manner so <HI>peaceful,</HI> after so much reason to fear the contrary, <HI>our mouths were-filled with laughter and our tongues with singing.</HI> Our Churches rang with the high <HI>praises</HI> of God, and with continued <HI>prayers for the life of the King and of his Son.</HI> We trusted in God that he was building a <HI>sure House</HI> for the Prote∣stant cause, and <HI>speaking of it for a great while to come</HI> in the Person of His ROYAL HIGHNESS and his numerous <HI>Illustrious Offspring;</HI> as <HI>the Lord gave to David a Lamp in Jerusalem, to set up his Son after him and to establish his people.</HI></P>
<P>But we were soon struck with <HI>horror</HI> and just detestation at the hellish plots and <HI>rebel∣lions,</HI> formed by a restless <HI>party</HI> in the Nation, whom no oaths could bind, nor clemency conquer, nor the rebukes of a righteous Pro∣vidence deter: Nor were we from time to time less affected wiah a sincere and dutiful <HI>joy,</HI> to hear how God brought their wicked de∣vices to light, and cover'd the abetters of them with infamy; while at the same time the <HI>fame</HI> of the felicity of the Nation under the <HI>Kings</HI> wise administration reached us, and of the vast influence of his <HI>Majesty's</HI> Coun∣sels and power upon the grand affairs of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="002852_0005_0FE677C483CFC4E0"/>
When some of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> doubly sworn to the <HI>King</HI> and the <HI>Faith</HI> he defended, appear'd to head the vile attenpts to disturb a <HI>Protestant Reign,</HI> we readily took the Occasion given us to declare our astonishment at and abhor∣rence of the perfidy and impiety. For what were those <HI>Englishmen</HI> and <HI>Protestants,</HI> falsly so called, plotting to introduce, but the two transcendent plagues of <HI>popery</HI> and <HI>slavery</HI> upon the Nations? With amazement and disdain the <HI>protestant Dissenters</HI> beheld the <HI>villany,</HI> and cry'd to the God of Heaven against the men, his enemies more than ours. The mean while it was their humble <HI>trust</HI> in the mercy of God, that while his <HI>Majesty</HI> was asserting the rights of <HI>Conscience,</HI> and restoring to God his Throne in the <HI>Soul</HI> of man, God would not fail to defend his Servant on the <HI>British Throne.</HI> God answer'd the faith and prayer of his peo∣ple, and return'd the wickedness of the <HI>Kings</HI> enemies on their own head.</P>
<P>This was the language of the <HI>Addresses</HI> from the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the <HI>Province</HI> at their annual <HI>Conventions;</HI> and I have presum'd to transcribe a <HI>paragraph</HI> or two of them, for an abiding <HI>Testimony</HI> of their servent <HI>loyalty to Christ and the Protestant Royal Family.</HI></P>
<P>Thanks be to God the Protestant Succession lives in his present <HI>Majesty</HI> King <HI>GEOROE the Second;</HI> and accordingly the tyde of Joy has run as high among us in the happy Succession
<PB N="iv" REF="002852_0006_0FE677AE0D43B4C8"/>of the <HI>Son,</HI> as it did on the Accession of the great King his <HI>Father.</HI></P>
<P>May the Clemencies of his <HI>Majesty's</HI> Govern∣ment extend always to these <HI>American Churches,</HI> which know not of <HI>one</HI> single person in their <HI>Communion</HI> that is not loyally affected to <HI>Him</HI> and to his <HI>House.</HI> May he shine long at the head of the <HI>Protestant Interest,</HI> its powerful Friend and Protector; and reign always in the hearts of all his <HI>protestant Subjects,</HI> being ever to them <HI>as the light of the Morning, and as the breath of their Nostrils.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Fidelity to <HI>Christ</HI> And to the <HI>Protestant Succession.</HI></HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>1 Chron. XII. 18.</HI></BIBL>
<P>Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the Captains, and he said,</P>
<P>Thine are we David, and on thy side thou Son of Jesse: Peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>OUR faithful <HI>zeal</HI> for and adherence to the <HI>Protestant Succession</HI> in the House of <HI>Hannover,</HI> is our <HI>fidelity</HI> to <HI>CHRIST</HI> and his holy Religion. Upon the <HI>death</HI> of the first Protestant <HI>King</HI> of that illustrious <HI>House,</HI> and the <HI>succession</HI> of his <HI>Son</HI> to the <HI>Throne</HI> over us, my Tho'ts have fix'd upon the <HI>words</HI> read as proper to direct and excite our <HI>Allegiance,</HI> first to <HI>Christ</HI> and our holy Religion, and then to the
<PB N="2" REF="002852_0008_0FE677AE31E139E0"/><HI>Royal Protestant Family,</HI> which is to us as the House of <HI>David</HI> was under God to <HI>Israel,</HI> the bulwark and defence of the <HI>Word,</HI> worship and truth of God. And if it may be pleasant to us as <HI>Britons</HI> and <HI>Protestants</HI> to make before God our solemn <HI>protestations,</HI> thro' Grace, of an inviolate <HI>Loyalty</HI> to the House of our <HI>King,</HI> and to pour out our <HI>prayers</HI> to God for his long and peaceful <HI>Reign</HI> over us; How much more ought it to please and delight us as <HI>Christians</HI> to have an higher Application of the words in our view? I mean a cordial and fer∣vent profession of our duty to <HI>Christ,</HI> who is <HI>Da∣vid our King;</HI> by whom Kings reign, and to whom in coming up to worship we do in effect always say, <HI>Thine are we, thou Son of David! and on thy side thou root of Jesse! Peace, peace be to thy Church and kingdom, cause and interest among men, and unto all its helpers, for thy God hath helped it and will do so.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>form</HI> therefore into which I shall cast the present <HI>Discourse,</HI> is this;
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I will consider the <HI>words</HI> a little as they stand here spoken by <HI>Amasai</HI> to <HI>David.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I will apply them to <HI>our selves</HI> in the House of our <HI>Protestant King,</HI> And then</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. I shall apply them to our <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> and that bond and profession of Fidelity to <HI>Him,</HI> which we are all under by our <HI>Baptism.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. I will consider the words as they were spo∣ken by <HI>Amasai</HI> unto <HI>David.</HI> And so I shall con∣sider <HI>Who</HI> this <HI>Amasai</HI> was? the <HI>Occasion</HI> on which he spake; the <HI>Spirit</HI> by which he spake, and the <HI>Words</HI> themselves.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002852_0009_0FE677C67A5ADBA8"/>
As to the <HI>first</HI> we can only say with certainty, that <HI>he was of the children of Benjamin or Judah,</HI> and one of the <HI>chief Captains,</HI> a Collonel or Gene∣ral Officer that had Captains under him. But I judge he was not that <HI>Amasa</HI> who afterward sided with <HI>Absalom,</HI> and was made the General of his Army.</P>
<P>AS to the <HI>Occasion</HI> of his coming to <HI>David</HI> and speaking as he did, the <HI>Chapter</HI> gives this plain account of it: "That before and after the death of <HI>Saul</HI> many Persons of distinction, and men of war fit for the battel, appeared openly for <HI>David</HI> and went over to him; to assert his right to the <HI>Crown,</HI> and to bring about a <HI>Revolution</HI> in God's time. Among these were some of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Benjamin</HI> with this <HI>Amasai</HI> at the head of them. Upon the notice of their approach <HI>David went out to meet them;</HI> either to shew them the more re∣spect and do 'em honour, or rather in some fear and jealousy of their design: For he had lately met with many <HI>treacheries</HI> from his own <HI>Tribe,</HI> and his caution now was wise and just. Wherefore he met them on his guard, and said to 'em, <HI>If ye be come peaceably to me to help me, my heart shall be knit to you; but if ye be come to betray me to my ene∣mies, seeing there is no wrong in my hands, the God of our Fathers look thereon and rebuke it.</HI> What could be said with more piety, probity and prudence on such an occasion? The wisdom and honesty of the <HI>man</HI> equally shine forth in this <HI>divine sentence,</HI> worthy the mouth of a <HI>King.</HI> My <HI>text</HI> is the an∣swer of <HI>Amasai</HI> unto these words of <HI>David;</HI> a no∣ble and heroic Answer.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="002852_0010_0FE677B4844D3240"/>
WHEREFORE in the next place let us note the <HI>Spirit,</HI> wisdom and fortitude with which he spake: <HI>The spirit came upon Amasai and he said.</HI> <Q>The <HI>Spirit of God</HI> came upon him: not the spi∣rit of <HI>Prophecy</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mr.</HI> Henry.</NOTE>, but a spirit of wisdom and re∣solution suitable to the present occasion. Words were put into his mouth most proper to satisfy <HI>David,</HI> and to animate himself and company.</Q> Nothing could be said more fine and great on a sudden. His words breathe <HI>the spirit of love, and power and of a sound mind.</HI> The man spake as one <HI>inspir'd</HI> on the occasion. He was carried away in the Spirit, and spake above himself, to the sur∣prize of all that heard him. Here was the spirit of wisdom and might, the spirit of courage and of the fear of the Lord. The sincerity and zeal, the vehemence and eloquence are equal; and so the loyalty to <HI>David</HI> and the devotion towards God. It was <HI>spiritus audaciae et fortitudinis,</HI> a spirit of fortitude and boldness, as became a religious <HI>Soldier</HI> and a <HI>chief Captain. David</HI>'s words to him and his company were very moving and en∣gaging; and no doubt but <HI>Amasai</HI>'s heart was full before, what and how to speak when he came into <HI>David</HI>'s presence; but he seems to drop all that he had premeditated, and answers under a sudden impulse of Spirit, and as in an extasie of love and joy; <HI>Thine are we David, and on thy side, thou Son of Jesse!</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>AND so I come to the <HI>Words</HI> themselves, where∣in we have
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. A <HI>profession</HI> of Allegiance to <HI>David.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="5" REF="002852_0011_0FE677C6A41D48F8"/>
2. A <HI>Prayer</HI> to God for him and his.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. An <HI>assu∣rance</HI> to him of <HI>help</HI> from God.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. HERE is a cordial and open <HI>profession</HI> of true faith and allegiance to <HI>David; Thine are we David, and on thy side thou Son of Jesse.</HI></P>
<P>THE heart manifestly went with the mouth in these words. Here is nothing of meer com∣pliment, flattery and daubing; but an honest and zealous heart laid naked and open. A thousand words artfully put together would not have ex∣pressed so much of the Soul. <HI>Tecum sumus: A par∣tibus tuis stamus et stabimus.</HI> We are with thee, and will stand by thee.</P>
<P>THEY <HI>chuse</HI> him for their <HI>Prince</HI> and <HI>King; own</HI> his <HI>right</HI> to be over them, and voluntarily <HI>sub∣ject</HI> themselves to him as their ruler and leader. <HI>Thine</HI> are we to <HI>command</HI> us, thine to serve and <HI>obey</HI> thee: Thine to be <HI>protected</HI> and defended by thee; and thine to <HI>assist</HI> and serve thee, wherein we are able, in all thy rights and interests; thine in a particular manner to <HI>fight</HI> for thee, against all thine enemies. <HI>Thine</HI> upon the <HI>terms</HI> and cove∣nant now proposed, which were— that they came <HI>peaceably to help him,</HI> and that <HI>his heart should be knit</HI> to them. <HI>Thine are we David.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. HERE is a <HI>prayer</HI> to God for <HI>David</HI> and for all <HI>his; Peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to thy helpers.</HI> A familiar prayer and form of salutation among the <HI>Jews; Peace be to thee.</HI> A comprehen∣sive prayer for all manner of prosperity and hap∣piness. <HI>Peace</HI> comprehends every thing, temporal or spiritual, from God and with men. All the blessings of goodness for body and soul, for time and eternity, are contained in this single and short word, <HI>Peace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="002852_0012_0FE677B4D1C79708"/>
PEACE to <HI>David</HI> in the text was to wish him all safety, defence and security from <HI>Saul</HI> and all his enemies; the protection of God upon his per∣son, the presence of God with him in his coun∣cils and all his enterprises, and that success and victory might ever attend him. They wish him a peaceable accession to and enjoyment of the Throne of <HI>Israel</HI> in God's time.</P>
<P>THE wish is doubled <HI>peace, peace!</HI> twice <HI>peace;</HI> to express the <HI>ardency</HI> of their desire, and to assure him the more of their <HI>sincerity.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AND Peace be to thy helpers,</HI> to all thy friends and followers, to all who are on thy side, and favour thy righteous cause; to all that wish thee well, and are the helpers of thy peace, secretly or openly; to all that seek the peace of <HI>Jerusa∣lem</HI> in thy <HI>Accession</HI> to the Crown: For the peace of the Church and people of God was bound up in <HI>David</HI>'s peace.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>AMASAI</HI> gives him a very good <HI>reason</HI> both for the profession and prayer made by him, and a happy <HI>assurance</HI> of peace to him and his: <HI>for thy God helpeth thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THINE are we, and on thy side,</HI> for we see that <HI>God</HI> is with thee and for thee; and shall not we be on <HI>his</HI> (the <HI>Lord</HI>'s) side? Nay, but <HI>whom</HI> the <HI>Lord God of Israel</HI> is with and for, we will be with and for <HI>him</HI> also. <HI>Abimelech</HI> for this reason visited <HI>Isaac,</HI> and took his <HI>chief Captain</HI> with him, to make a league of amity; and he did wifely, Gen. 26.28. <HI>We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee, and we said— let us make a covenant with thee,</HI> for <HI>thou art the blessed of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002852_0013_0FE677CC19989108"/>
Again, <HI>THY God helps thee,</HI> therefore <HI>peace</HI> be to thee and thine, <HI>peace</HI> must and shall be to thee: For <HI>if God be for us who shall be against us?</HI> They whom <HI>He</HI> helps are helped indeed: <HI>Great peace have they and nothing shall offend them.</HI></P>
<P>WE may understand <HI>Amasai</HI> here,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That he remembers and owns how God had chosen <HI>David,</HI> and sent <HI>Samuel</HI> to anoint him in his Fathers house.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. How he and others had observed <HI>Gods being with him</HI> and helping him from that day.</ITEM>
</LIST>
Before he came to <HI>Court</HI> or <HI>Camp,</HI> it was observ'd of him, that he was valorous and <HI>prudent and the Lord was with him.</HI> 1 Sam. 16.18. When he first came to the field of <HI>Battle,</HI> they had seen God won∣drously with him in the slaughter of <HI>Goliah.</HI> Af∣terward he <HI>went out and came in</HI> wearing the royal Commission, and his conduct, courage and success was the envy of <HI>Saul</HI> and the talk of all the King∣dom. God <HI>prospered him in all his ways.</HI> 1 Sam. 18.14. In his <HI>Exile</HI> God marvellously led and guided him, <HI>cover'd</HI> and protected him, and twice deli∣ver'd <HI>Saul</HI> himself into his hand. All that ob∣serv'd him saw the justice and prudence of his <HI>Councils,</HI> and the <HI>generous</HI> part he acted from time to time; and they could not but own and say— <HI>Thy God helpeth thee.</HI> They did well therefore to go over <HI>to his help against the mighty,</HI> and to pre∣dict and wish <HI>peace</HI> to him and to all his <HI>helpers.</HI></P>
<P>FOR <HI>Amasai</HI> seems to <HI>prophesie</HI> as well as <HI>pray;</HI> to predict, foretel, promise and assure <HI>peace</HI> to <HI>Da∣vid</HI> and his helpers. He strengthens his hands and encourages his heart in the Lord his God: Thy God <HI>helpeth</HI> thee, and <HI>will</HI> still <HI>help;</HI> he has
<PB N="8" REF="002852_0014_0FE677B6134211A8"/>hitherto delivered thee, and <HI>will deliver</HI> thee from all thy enemies: He hath thus far assisted thee toward the <HI>Crown</HI> before thee, and he will bring thee to the <HI>Kingdom,</HI> and establish thee on the <HI>Throne of Israel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THY God helpeth thee,</HI> we come to be helpers under Him, <HI>workers together with him;</HI> in the hand of his Providence, Spirit and Grace. <HI>His peace</HI> be to thee, and in <HI>thy peace we</HI> shall have peace.</P>
<P>THEY do but pray for <HI>themselves,</HI> in their good wishes to <HI>David</HI> and his cause. They come in for a <HI>share</HI> in the peace they wish him, putting themselves among his helpers.</P>
<P>Finally, THEY pray <HI>believingly,</HI> Thy God <HI>will help</HI> thee; peace <HI>will</HI> be to thee: They be∣lieve upon <HI>experience,</HI> Thy God <HI>has</HI> helped thee, and <HI>doth</HI> help <HI>thee.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this for the <HI>first</HI> thing proposed, which was to <HI>open</HI> the words, as they are here spoken by <HI>Amasai</HI> to <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I come now to <HI>apply them unto our selves in the House of our King, the Protestant royal Family.</HI></P>
<P>AND thanks be to GOD that we can apply them thus. Thanks be to God that there is the <HI>Protestant House of Hannover</HI> on the Throne over us, who are unto us as the <HI>House of David;</HI> the cause interest and kingdom of God among us de∣pending so much on the peace and establishment thereof.</P>
<P>AND thanks be to God none is more ready than the <HI>Governour,</HI> the <HI>chief Captain</HI> over us, to make this profession and prayer of <HI>Amasai;</HI> and none more heartily inclined than the people of
<PB N="9" REF="002852_0015_0FE677CC3B7782C0"/>God in this land to accompany him in it. How ardently, God knows! there not being a disloyal heart known to us, nor suspected in our Churches. We can <HI>all</HI> say to our <HI>King</HI> and to his <HI>House, Thine are we, and on thy side:</HI> We can <HI>all</HI> freely and heartily pray for <HI>Him</HI> and <HI>His, Peace, peace be to thee and to thy helpers.</HI> We also can look back on the late years, and say with thanksgiving to God, <HI>Thy God hath helped thee.</HI> And let us humbly hope and trust that He will yet help.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE House of our <HI>King</HI> is unto us as the House of <HI>David,</HI> chosen and raised by the God of Heaven as the present bulwark against <HI>Popery,</HI> and for the security of the true knowledge and worship of God among us. And may he be as <HI>David</HI> a man after <HI>Gods own heart,</HI> ever on the side of true Religion and zealous for it, a lover of God's house and worship, a true defender of the faith, the high <HI>Patron</HI> of Godliness, and valiant in the cause of God to <HI>fight the Lord's Battles.</HI> May He like <HI>David</HI> be endow'd and spirited for the day and time wherein Providence has cast his Reign, and have a great Name and Influence a∣mong the Nations. May he be <HI>wise as an Angel of God,</HI> and ever brave and open in a good Cause. May he be <HI>just, ruling in the fear of God,</HI> and so be to his people as <HI>the light of the morning,</HI> and as the <HI>showers upon the grass:</HI> Yea as <HI>the breath of our No∣strils.</HI> May he enjoy and reign in the <HI>hearts</HI> of his People, as <HI>David</HI> did in the hearts of all <HI>Israel.</HI> May he inherit and exhibit the more than royal Virtues and graces of <HI>David,</HI> and fall into none of his <HI>Sins.</HI> May he be own'd, protected, prosper'd and establish'd by the <HI>Lord God of Israel</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="002852_0016_0FE677B639BBF3F8"/>as <HI>David</HI> was, and his <HI>name</HI> be terrible to his ene∣mies, and his <HI>arms</HI> victorious over them as <HI>David</HI>'s were; and both be always comfortable to the Church and people of God. And after a long and happy reign like <HI>David</HI>'s, may he be help'd by Grace to finish his course and <HI>die</HI> like him; leaving his earthly Dominions in <HI>peace,</HI> and a <HI>Son</HI> to build up the House of God for future genera∣tions, while He shall go to <HI>reign in life by Jesus Christ.</HI> So may the <HI>King</HI> and <HI>royal Family</HI> be to us as the House of <HI>David.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. SO let our <HI>Israel</HI> be to Him; loyal, faithful, dutiful and obedient; and those that shall rise a∣gainst him, be as <HI>Absalom, Shimei</HI> and <HI>Sheba the son of Bichri.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HIS</HI> we are in the relation and bonds of <HI>Sub∣jects.</HI> We profess it and <HI>swear</HI> to it. And we are <HI>his</HI> by inclination and choice as well as <HI>Oath.</HI> We are <HI>his</HI> and on the <HI>side</HI> of true and pure religion.</P>
<P>WE wish and pray <HI>peace, peace</HI> to Him and his serene House. We can do little but <HI>pray</HI> for him and his: Let us do <HI>that</HI> servently and uprightly, and none shall do <HI>more</HI> or better than we.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Day</HI> calls for <HI>this</HI> prayer, and hitherto it has done so, and it has been graciously answered. Let this excite us to pray on; and we must be ready to add our united small endeavours, in our respective places, and be among the <HI>peaceable in Israel.</HI></P>
<P>AND to move, animate, confirm and strength∣en us in these our dutiful resolutions, professions, prayers and endeavours, let us consider how God has appeared hitherto for the <HI>help</HI> of the <HI>Protestant Succession.</HI> We must set up our <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> our <HI>Stone
<PB N="11" REF="002852_0017_0FE677CEB9EAF720"/>of help,</HI> and say, <HI>Hitherto the Lord hath helped.</HI></P>
<P>LET us give all the glory to God, and thank∣fully remember to his praise the marvellous Ope∣rations of his <HI>Spirit</HI> and Providence, <HI>first</HI> in the <HI>Act of Parliament</HI> which <HI>limits</HI> the <HI>Succession</HI> to the <HI>Imperial Crown</HI> of <HI>Great Britain</HI> to the <HI>Protestant Branches</HI> of the <HI>Royal Family;</HI> And <HI>then</HI> in the <HI>re∣straints</HI> that have been upon the <HI>Enemies</HI> of that Succession, confounding them in their counsels, and defeating all their conspiracies and enterpri∣zes, turning them all <HI>into foolishness.</HI></P>
<P>AND then let us implore always the continued <HI>help</HI> of God, and the <HI>watch</HI> of his merciful and tender Providence ovr the Person and Family of our King; beseeching God to <HI>establish his throne,</HI> and to <HI>build him a sure house;</HI> to bless all his <HI>helpers</HI> and blast all his enemies; to <HI>sling out</HI> their <HI>Souls,</HI> while <HI>the life of the King shall be bound up in the bun∣dle of life with the Lord his God.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I hasten in the <HI>third</HI> and last place,</P>
<P N="3">III. TO consider and improve the <HI>Text</HI> in an Application of it to CHRIST, who is <HI>David our King;</HI> and to that <HI>bond</HI> and <HI>profession</HI> of fidelity and love to <HI>Christ</HI> which we are under by our <HI>Baptism. "Thine are we, and on thy side thou Son of David: Peace, peace be to Thee and thine; for thy God helpeth thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>DAVID</HI> and his kingdom were but <HI>Types</HI> of the Kingdom of <HI>Christ,</HI> the <HI>Son and Lord of David.</HI> HE is <HI>God's King</HI> upon his holy hill of <HI>Zion;</HI> the King of the Church and of the World; <HI>our Lawgiver, our Judge, and our Saviour.</HI> We have <HI>no King but</HI> JESUS; that is to say, none but in Subordination
<PB N="12" REF="002852_0018_0FE677BB56EFCBB0"/>to and under <HI>Him</HI> the <HI>supream</HI> King of the Earth and of the Church. By Him <HI>kings</HI> reign, and to Him every <HI>knee</HI> must bow: <HI>All kings must fall down before him, all nations must serve him.</HI> We must cry before him <HI>Hozanna, blessed be thy kingdom.</HI> We must pray for the <HI>peace</HI> of his people, and bless God for all the <HI>help</HI> and protection granted to it. God has <HI>helped</HI> it, and will help it for ever. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
<P>IN <HI>us,</HI> in our worship and obedience is fulfilled that word of the Prophet <HI>Hosea,</HI> 3 Chap. 5 v. <HI>They shall seek the Lord their God and David their king, and shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the latter days.</HI> Jerem. 30.9. <HI>They shall serve the Lord their God and David their king, whom I will raise up untto them.</HI> Our Allegiance to <HI>Christ</HI> must be our first and chief care; on this our eternal Salvation depends. It is our first duty and interest. Our reverence and loyalty and fidelity to our earthly Prince is of little price in the sight of God, and will turn to little advantage to us, if we do not first come into a religious subjection to the Son of God, as <HI>Prince and Saviour.</HI> In obedience to <HI>Him</HI> we obey <HI>Caesar.</HI> It is <HI>Christ</HI>'s Law, <HI>Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.</HI> In all the duty we render to <HI>Men</HI> we serve the <HI>Lord Christ,</HI> and must do it as <HI>his</HI> Subjects and Servants; in obedience to his Pre∣cept, in submission to his Providence, and for the sake of his people, cause and kingdom in the World.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then, let us say to Christ, and say it hear∣tily, <HI>Thine are we, Thou Son of David.</HI> We have said so in our <HI>Baptism,</HI> we say so in our open <HI>Pro∣fession.</HI> We have said so in our solemn <HI>Self-dedica∣tions</HI> to the Lord that died for us, whether in se∣cret
<PB N="13" REF="002852_0019_0FE677CEE6BC5608"/>or in publick: We say so in all our <HI>prayers,</HI> in every act of <HI>worship,</HI> and in a special manner every time we go to the <HI>Table</HI> of Christ. Our professions and declarations are those, O <HI>my Soul, thou hast said to the Lord, thou art my Lord! I am thine, save me! The Lord, whose I am and whom I serve.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THINE are we,</HI> O <HI>thou Son of David!</HI> Thine by absolute <HI>propriety</HI> and unalienable right, <HI>made</HI> by thee and for thee, and having our <HI>being</HI> in thee; for thou art <HI>One with the Father!</HI> Thine by <HI>purchase,</HI> for thou hast <HI>bought us with thy blood:</HI> 1 Cor. 6.20. <HI>Ye are nor your own, for ye are bought with a price.</HI> Thine by <HI>Covenant,</HI> by sacred pro∣mises and religious vows; thine by choice and thine by contract! Thine by <HI>conquest,</HI> for <HI>thou hast saved us from our enemies and from the hand of them that hate us, that we should serve thee without fear in holiness and righteousness before thee all the days of our life.</HI> Thine truly and indeed if subdued by thee, and made <HI>thy willing people in the day of thy power!</HI> For then we may know also that we are Thine by the <HI>donation</HI> of the Father; <HI>for all whom the Father hath given thee shall come unto thee!</HI> And whosoever does so is thine to be <HI>saved</HI> by thee; eternally and unchangeably <HI>Thine,</HI> to be <HI>blessed</HI> in thee for ever and ever, and that thou mayest be <HI>magnified</HI> and admired in them thro' the ages of Eternity.</P>
<P>THIS is the Covenant of Grace made with us in <HI>Christ Jesus;</HI> Ezek. 34.23, 24. <HI>I will set up one shepherd over them, and he shall feed them; even my servant David, He shall feed them and shall be their shepherd: And I the Lord will be their God, and my
<PB N="14" REF="002852_0020_0FE677BB7939C7C0"/>servant David a prince among them; I the Lord have spoken it, and I will make with them a Covenant of peace.</HI></P>
<P>THUS every way, and by all possible bonds, we are <HI>Christ</HI>'s: His to serve him, his to enjoy him; his to glorify him on earth, and his to be glorified by him and with him for ever: His and <HI>on his side;</HI> his People our People and his God our God. We are <HI>his</HI> and for none else; none in comparison of him, none in competition with him; We <HI>call no Man Master on Earth</HI> but in sub∣ordination to him; <HI>for one is your Master, even Christ.</HI> Mat 23.10.</P>
<P>AND as this is our <HI>Christian Profession,</HI> Thine are we <HI>David!</HI> so <HI>secondly</HI> this is our <HI>prayer</HI> for his Church and people, kingdom and interest, <HI>Peace, peace be to it</HI> and to its <HI>helpers.</HI> So has God sent forth the <HI>Spirit of his Son</HI> into the hearts of the true members of his Church, the <HI>Spirit of grace and supplication,</HI> teaching and inspiring them to <HI>pray for the peace</HI> of it. Every devout Soul, man woman and child can do this, and are ready to do it; they abundantly <HI>owe</HI> it to the <HI>House of the Lord their God;</HI> to <HI>Him</HI> whose the House is, and to <HI>them</HI> that belong to it; and for the sake of <HI>both</HI> they are heartily inclined to pray always <HI>this</HI> pray∣er. Psalm. 122. <HI>Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: They shall prosper that love thee: Peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces: For my bre∣thren and companions sake I will now say, Peace be within thee: Because of the House of the Lord our God I will seek thy good.</HI></P>
<P>What <HI>less</HI> can we wish and ask for <HI>the whole Israel of God</HI> than this? <HI>Grace be with all them that love
<PB N="15" REF="002852_0021_0FE677D3F082C708"/>our Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity! Peace be to the Brethren, and love with faith from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ! The Lord of peace bless his peo∣ple with it; give them peace always by all means.</HI></P>
<P>THE reign of <HI>Solomon</HI> was a type of the king∣dom of <HI>Christ,</HI> his spiritual reign in and over elect Souls. Peace was the blessing of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s reign, and this is the blessing of Christ's kingdom, who is <HI>the Prince of peace,</HI> who is <HI>our peace,</HI> whose <HI>king∣dom is righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>WELL then may we wish and cry <HI>peace, peace</HI> to this Kingdom of <HI>the Son of David,</HI> in whom <HI>righteousness and peace have met and kissed each other; that glory may dwell in our land.</HI></P>
<P>GOD has <HI>spoken</HI> peace to the Church and kingdom of his <HI>Son,</HI> and therein directed us to pray for it. Isa. 66.12. <HI>I will extend peace to her as a river, and the glory of the Gentiles as a flowing stream.</HI> Psal. 72.3, 7. <HI>The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hill, by righteous∣ness; in his days the righteous shall flourish, and abundance of peaee so long as the moon endureth.</HI> These <HI>promises</HI> of a gracious God we must turn into <HI>prayers,</HI> and make <HI>pleas</HI> of them in our prayers. Gal. 6.16. <HI>Peace be on them and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</HI> 1. Pet. 5. ult. <HI>Peace be with all that are in Christ Jesus, Amen.</HI></P>
<P>AND now in the <HI>third</HI> and last place, let us consider the <HI>assurance</HI> we have of being heard in this <HI>prayer,</HI> and put our <HI>Amen</HI> to it, — It <HI>is so</HI> and it <HI>shall be</HI> so; <HI>Peace</HI> will and must be to the Church and kingdom of <HI>Christ,</HI> — <HI>for his God helpeth him.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="002852_0022_0FE677A8ABD2BC18"/>
HE who establish'd the Throne of <HI>David,</HI> will much more build up and establish the Kingdom of <HI>his dear Son.</HI> The <HI>promises to David</HI> and his kingdom were but <HI>typical and prophetical</HI> of the glo∣ry and perpetuity of the Kingdom of <HI>Christ,</HI> and in him they are fulfilled in their utmost extent. I need only turn you to that famous place, Psalm. 89.20,—29. <HI>I have found DAVID my servant, with my holy oil have I anointed him: with whom my hand shall be established, my arm also shall strength∣en him; I will beat down his foes before him, and plague them that hate him; My faithfulness and mer∣cy shall be with him, and in my name shall his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be exalted: I will set his hand in the sea, and his right hand in the rivers: He shall cry unto me, Thou art my Father, my God and the rock of my salvation; Also I will make him my first-born, higher than the kings of the earth: My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant shall stand fast with him; His seed will I make to endure for ever, and his throne as the days of heaven.</HI></P>
<P>MANY like promises of <HI>peace</HI> and success to <HI>Christs</HI> kingdom, under the type of <HI>David,</HI> we find in the <HI>Book</HI> of God. And <HI>he must reign till all his enemies are put under his feet. Nebuchadnezzar</HI> saw this in his dream: He saw <HI>a stone that smote the Image</HI> of jealousie, Idolatry and and all false wor∣ship and impiety, <HI>and the stone became a great moun∣tain and filled the whole earth:</HI> As <HI>Daniel</HI> interpre∣ted the matter, so we have seen it, <HI>The God of heaven hath in these latter days set up a Kingdom ne∣ver to be destroyed, which shall break in pieces and consume all these, and it shall stand for ever.</HI> Dan. 2.35, 44.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="002852_0023_0FE677D41750A4A8"/>
THE Churches <HI>help</HI> stands in the <HI>Name</HI> of the Lord; and if He help, the Church must stand and prevail. Our Lord <HI>Jesus</HI> bids his weak and timerous <HI>Flock</HI> not fear, for it is <HI>the Father's good pleasure to give them the kingdom.</HI> If he <HI>help</HI> who shall withstand and oppose? On this <HI>rock</HI> he has built his Church, <HI>God shall help her and that right early; God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved: The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved; he uttered his voice, the earth melted.</HI> Psal. 46 5, 6.</P>
<P>NOW this is a sufficient <HI>reason</HI> 1. for the <HI>pro∣fession</HI> we make to <HI>Christ, Thine are we, for thy God helpeth thee:</HI> And 2. for the <HI>prayer, Peace, peace</HI> be to thee and thine, <HI>for thy God helpeth thee.</HI> This assures <HI>peace</HI> to the Church, this the rock of salvation to it; <HI>thy God helpeth thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THE Lord liveth, and blessed be my rock, and let the God of my Salvation be exalted.</HI> He <HI>creates peace, peace. Faithful is He that has promised, who also will do it. The Lord sitteth upon the floods, the Lord sitteth King for ever: The Lord will give strength to his People, the Lord will bless his people with peace.</HI></P>
<P><HI>AMEN!</HI> blessed God and <HI>Saviour!</HI> It <HI>is so,</HI> it <HI>has been</HI> so, and so it <HI>shall be!</HI> We <HI>wish</HI> it, we <HI>believe</HI> it, we <HI>pray</HI> for it, and <HI>do as thou hast said; And let the house of David</HI> (which is the Church of the living God) be established for ever.</P>
<P>We would join the <HI>multitudes</HI> that attended <HI>Christ</HI> with their joyful <HI>Acclamations,</HI> on his descent from
<PB N="18" REF="002852_0024_0FE677D66959BD38"/>the mount of <HI>Olives:</HI> Luke 19.38. <HI>Blessed be the king that cometh in the name of the Lord! peace in heaven and glory in the highest.</HI></P>
<P>WE would join in the loud voice of <HI>those</HI> out of <HI>all nations and kindreds, and people and tongues;</HI> Rev. 7.10.12. <HI>Salvation be unto Him that sitteth upon the throne, and to the Lamb! Amen: Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honour and power and might be unto our God for ever and ever. Amen.</HI></P>
