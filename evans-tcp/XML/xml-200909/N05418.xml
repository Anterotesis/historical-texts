<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>AS I am of the Opinion, that little Manuals of the Sciences, if they could be well done, would be of good Use to young Beginners; what I aim at in this little Tract, is to be as useful to them as I can, in the Studies of <HI>Metaphysicks</HI> and <HI>Lo∣gicks,</HI> and this in order to the more particular Stu∣dies of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Morals,</HI> by giving as clear Definitions as I am able in few Words, of the principal Matters and Terms whereof those Studies consist; which I have endeavoured to do, in an Order of Thoughts, gradually arising one after ano∣ther, in a Manner as instructive as could well be, in so short a Compass. I have also proposed to shew how these Studies, taking their Rise from the first Beginnings of Sense, proceed on through the other Studies, to raise the Mind gradually to its highest Perfection and Happiness.</P>
<P>THO' I would not be too much attached to any one Author or System, exclusive of any others; yet whoever is versed in the Writings of Bishop <HI>Berkeley,</HI> will be sensible that I am in a particular Manner beholden to that excellent Philosopher for several Thoughts that occur in the following Tract. And I cannot but recommend it to any one that would think with Exactness on these Subjects, to peruse all the Works of that great and good Gentle∣man (as well as those of <HI>Locke, Norris,</HI> or <HI>Mal∣branch</HI> and <HI>Cambray</HI>) if it were for no other Rea∣son, at least for this, that they will, in the best Manner lead him to think closely, and to think for himself. And I was the rather willing to publish this <HI>Logick,</HI> because I think <HI>Metaphysicks</HI> a ne∣cessary Part of that Science, and that I apprehend it a great Damage to the Sciences that the old <HI>Me∣taphysicks</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="006859_0006_102A867873A8DE68"/>
are so much neglected, and that they might be rendered the more pleasant and useful by joining with them some Improvements of the Moderns.</P>
<P>THIS little Tract I have introduced with a short <HI>General View</HI> of the whole <HI>System</HI> of <HI>Learn∣ing,</HI> wherein young Students may at once behold, as it were in Miniature, the Objects, Boundaries, Ends and Uses of each of the Sciences; their Foundation in the Nature of Things; the natural Order wherein they lie, and their several Relations and Connections, both with Respect to one another, and to the general End, viz. <HI>our Happiness,</HI> pursued thro' them all.</P>
<P>THIS seems to me as useful in the Instruction of young Beginners in the Sciences, as it is in teach∣ing <HI>Geography</HI> to exhibit, first of all, a general Map of the whole terraqueous Globe, in order to a more particular Description of the several Countries and Kingdoms in the following Maps; or in teach∣ing <HI>Astronomy,</HI> to give first a general Delineation of the whole System of the World, in order to ac∣count for the <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in the several particular Planets in the following Schemes. For, as in the <HI>natural World,</HI> one cannot have a just Notion of any particular Country, without considering its Si∣tuation in relation to the whole Globe, nor of any particular Globe, without considering its Situa∣tion with respect to the whole System; so in the <HI>intellectual World</HI> (if I may so call it) neither can one have a just Notion of any particular Science, without considering it as it stands related to the whole <HI>Circle of Learning,</HI> and the general End pursued through the Whole. And such a short Draught may also be of some Use to Students, to di∣rect and methodize their Thoughts, and enlarge their Minds, and at the same time engage their Applica∣tion and Industry in the Pursuit of their Studies.</P>

<HEAD>AN INTRODUCTION TO THE STUDY of PHILOSOPHY. Exhibiting a general View of all the Parts of LEARNING.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><P>Quod si cuique scientiae provincia sua tribuatur, limites assignentur, principia &amp; objecta accurate distinguantur, quae ad singulas pertinent, tractare licuerit, majore, tum facilitate, tum perspicui∣tate.</P>
<BIBL><HI>D. BERK. DE MOT.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P N="1">1. LEARNING implies the Know∣ledge of every Thing useful to our Well-being and true Happiness in this Life, or our supreme Happiness in the Life to come. And as our <HI>Happiness</HI> con∣sists in the Enjoyment of <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> by the right Exercise of our Understandings, Affections, Wills and active Powers, it must take in every Thing that relates both to <HI>Theory</HI> and <HI>Practice, i. e.</HI> both to <HI>Science</HI> and <HI>Art;</HI> for <HI>Science</HI> is the Knowledge of Truth considered speculatively, and <HI>Art</HI> is the Knowledge of Truth considered as directive of our Practice for the attaining our true Good or Happiness. And all the various
<PB N="x" REF="006859_0009_102A867F3B28A358" MS="y"/>
Parts of Learning may be reduced to these two, <HI>Philology,</HI> or the Study of <HI>Words</HI> and other Signs, and <HI>Philosophy,</HI> or the Study of the <HI>Things</HI> signifi∣ed by them. And,</P>
<P N="2">2. (I.) AS the Understandings of young Per∣sons, for the first fifteen or sixteen Years of their Life, are not ripe enough to enter into the sublimer Studies of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> it is necessary that during this Stage they should be chiefly employ'd in the Study of <HI>Philology,</HI> or the Languages, to which should be added the first Things in the <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> both which are most level to their juvenile Capacities, as they chiefly depend on the Imagination and Memory, which in Youth are most vigorous and tenacious.</P>
<P N="3">3. (1.) WITH regard to Language, they must be early initiated in the Rudiments of <HI>Grammar,</HI> or the Rules of <HI>Speech,</HI> relating both to the Ac∣cidents and Connection of Words, and this both in their Mother Tongue, and other Languages, especially the <HI>French, Latin, Greek</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> in which let them go as far as may be in this first Stage of Life.</P>
<P N="4">4. (2.) AS soon as they have got a good No∣tion of <HI>pure Speech</HI> by the Study of <HI>Grammar,</HI> let them learn the Nature of <HI>figurative Speech</HI> in <HI>Rhetorick:</HI> And from thence, as they go on to read the Classicks, let them learn the Use of the various Tropes and Figures in <HI>Oratory,</HI> which is the Art of true Eloquence, and explains the Topicks of Invention, the Rules of Disposition or Order, and of Elocution or Delivery. And,</P>
<P N="5">5. (3.) AS they go on to read the ancient Historians, let them apply themselves to the Stu∣dy of <HI>History,</HI> considered as the Art of an ele∣gant and just Narration of true Matters of Fact
<PB N="xi" REF="006859_0010_102A8680D2CBD808"/>
for the Benefit of Posterity. And that they may understand the Ancients the better, they should read the best modern Writers of History, which that they may read with Advantage, they ought to have some easy Instruction in <HI>Geography</HI> and <HI>Chronology,</HI> and make use of the best ancient and modern Maps of those Places, and Tables of those Times, to which their Books relate, which will render what they read the more intelligible, and take the deeper Impression on their Memo∣ries. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide</HI> Magazine for <HI>October,</HI> 1748.</NOTE> "History is a large Field, in which they will see the wonderful Series of Providence; strange Turns of Fortune, surprizing Occurrences, and an amazing Variety of Accidents; foolish Mortals labouring for Trifles, contending eagerly for Things they would be much happier without; some cursed in having their Wishes, raised to the utmost Height of Power and Grandeur, only to be thrown down thence with the greater Obloquy and Contempt; others pleasing themselves with their Obscurity, and laughing at the Noise and Bustle that surrounds them." All which tend to give the Youth a good Insight into human Na∣ture, and lead them to true Wisdom in their own Conduct.</P>
<P N="6">6. (4.) AS they go on to read the Poets, they should get some Knowledge of <HI>Poetry,</HI> consider∣ed as an Art, being a just and lively Description of Things or Persons, either real or imaginary, with an Elevation and Dignity of Thought, and with the Advantages of Numbers and Harmony, and every Kind of Ornament that Language is capable of, which will qualify them the better to entertain themselves with those great Masters of Wit and Eloquence. "There is something
<PB N="xii" REF="006859_0011_102A86834681F078"/>
charming in Verse; something that strikes the Ear, moves the Soul, rouses the Passions, and engages the Affections," while it fills the Soul with the most useful Instructions, attended with the most exquisite Delight. "It seems to have been the first Way of Writing, and in some Countries even older than Letters, and conse∣quently to have been the Voice of infant Nature in her early Bloom and native Sweetness. In it the Ancients explained their Sentiments, convey∣ed their Laws, and delivered their Precepts of Morality in Fable; the People liked the Instruc∣tions which came to them attended with Delight; and as they heard them with Pleasure, so they retained them with Ease." To this Head of Language belongs the <HI>Art of Criticism,</HI> which teaches the true Force of Words and Phrases, the Nature of Stile, and a true Taste, so as to make a right Judgment of the Beauties and Ex∣cellencies of any Performance in either of these Kinds of Writings.</P>
<P N="7">7. WHILE Youth are acquainting themselves with the Rudiments of <HI>Eloquence, History</HI> and <HI>Poetry,</HI> they should also be learning the first and easiest Things in the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> (which indeed, as well as Words, do in some Measure belong to the Doctrine of Signs) especially Things that re∣late to Practice, both in <HI>Arithmetick</HI> and <HI>Geome∣try,</HI> which will very much tend to engage and strengthen their Attention, enlarge their Capaci∣ties, and ripen their Minds. And something of <HI>natural History,</HI> with the Arts of <HI>Drawing</HI> and <HI>Musick,</HI> if they have a Taste for it, will be very pleasant and useful Amusements. And these Stu∣dies which they have begun in this first Period, and (it is to be hoped) made a considerable Pro∣gress
<PB N="xiii" REF="006859_0012_102A868646396DF8"/>
in, must be afterwards continued and carried to further Perfection, and made their Diversion at Turns, while they</P>
<P N="8">8. (II.) PROCEED, <HI>secondly,</HI> to the further Im∣provement of their Understandings and active Powers, in the sublimer Studies of <HI>Philosophy,</HI> which is the Study of Truth and Wisdom, or the Knowledge of <HI>Things,</HI> as being what they really are, together with a Conduct correspon∣dent thereunto, in the Pursuit of true Happiness; to which they must go on when they are sixteen or seventeen Years old. "And what concerns us in these more exalted Studies is, that we be very exact and careful to attend more to Things than Words, and endeavour to make such Things our own as will prove real Accomplishments to our Minds, and duly regulate both our Tempers and Manners; and such are the Knowledge of GOD and <HI>ourselves,</HI> for <HI>Philosophia est Rerum Divinarum Humanarumque Scientia,</HI> as <HI>Tully</HI> de∣fines it, and comprehendeth every Thing, both speculative and practical, upon these large and comprehensive Subjects.</P>
<P N="9">9. THE first, which relates to GOD, takes in the whole Creation; the full Extent of Being; for by the Contemplation of the Effects we arise to the Cause. "And as by considering that wonderful and amazing Power, that All-compre∣hending Wisdom, that inimitable Beauty, that surprizing Harmony, that immutable Order, which abundantly discover themselves in the For∣mation and Government of the Universe, we are led to their divine Original, who is the inex∣hausted Source, the glorious Fountain of all Per∣fection;" so by making due Reflections on the Operations of our own Minds, and the large Ex∣tent
<PB N="xiv" REF="006859_0013_102A8687D35EE0A8"/>
of our intellectual Faculties and their Ob∣jects; their several distinct Exertions, and their Subserviency to each other; the free Activity of our Souls, and the various Passions that put them on Action for attaining our several Ends; and the various Ways wherein they exert themselves, and exercise their Dominion over our Bodies; we may attain, in some good Measure, the Know∣ledge of ourselves, as well as of GOD, our chief Good, and the certain Means we must use, and the Method we must take to secure our true Happiness in the Enjoyment of Him, our∣selves, and one another. In order to the raising our Minds to these sublime Speculations, and to regulate our Actions in these noble Pursuits, it is necessary that we be able to form to ourselves clear Ideas and Conceptions of those <HI>Beings</HI> or Things on which we contemplate, whether <HI>Bo∣dies</HI> or <HI>Spirits:</HI> To the Attainment of which,</P>
<P N="10">10. (1.) <HI>LOGICK,</HI> or the Art of Reasoning, is very requisite, the Foundation of which is <HI>Me∣taphysicks,</HI> or the <HI>Philosophia prima,</HI> which, by some, hath been called <HI>Ontology,</HI> and is the noblest and most elevated Part of Science. It begins with sensi∣ble Objects, and from them takes its Rise to Things purely intellectual, and treats of <HI>Being</HI> abstracted from every particular Nature, whether <HI>Body</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> and of all the general Distinctions, Connections and Relations of Things, whether sensible or intellectual, and so lays a Foundation for clear and just Reasoning, while we proceed upon stable and unerring Principles. Which Foundation being laid, <HI>Logick</HI> teacheth us the Rules of thinking regularly, and <HI>reasoning</HI> justly, whereby we learn to distinguish <HI>Truth</HI> from <HI>Fal∣shood,</HI> and proceed from Things <HI>simple</HI> to Things
<PB N="xv" REF="006859_0014_102A8689C8126030"/>
<HI>compound,</HI> and from Things precarious and <HI>con∣tingent</HI> to Things <HI>necessary,</HI> stable and eternal, which therefore will result in the clearest and just∣est Views, both of all other Things, and of the adorable Excellencies of the divine Nature, that our little Minds are capable of.</P>
<P N="11">11. (2.) FROM these general Principles and Laws of Reasoning, we proceed to the Applica∣tion of them, first in the Study of <HI>Quantity</HI> in general, whether <HI>Number</HI> or <HI>Magnitude,</HI> in the sublimer <HI>Mathematicks,</HI> or the Arts of Compu∣tation. And here again opens a noble Scene of eternal Truth, in the Demonstration of a vast Number of Theorems and Problems, both <HI>Arith∣metical</HI> and <HI>Geometrical,</HI> to which <HI>Algebra</HI> is wonderfully subservient, in the Contemplation both of <HI>Lines, Surfaces</HI> and <HI>Solids,</HI> in all their endless Varieties and Proportions; which will en∣able us to proceed with the greater Advantage in the Study of Nature, and without which we cannot read with Understanding the best Things that have been written on that Subject. This Sort of Study hath likewise a direct Tendency to lead us to an admiring Sense of the Deity, in whose infinite Treasures of eternal Truth, we be∣hold these Connections and Demonstrations, who hath made all Things in Number, Measure and Weight. To this Head belong, <HI>Trigonometry, Geodaesia, Stereometry,</HI> the Doctrine of the <HI>Sphere</HI> and <HI>Cylinder,</HI> and of <HI>Conic Sections</HI> and <HI>Fluxions.</HI></P>
<P N="12">12. (3.) FROM the Contemplation of Quan∣tity in the <HI>Abstract,</HI> we go on next to the Con∣sideration of it in <HI>Concrete,</HI> or in the Objects of Sense, <HI>i. e.</HI> as blended with the other sensible Qualities, in the endlesly various Bodies that compose this mighty Frame of Heaven and
<PB N="xvi" REF="006859_0015_102A868E5F5D1168"/>
Earth, and the Principles and Laws of Motion, on which their Phaenomena depend, which are the Subjects of <HI>Physicks</HI> or <HI>natural Philosophy:</HI> The Foundation of which is <HI>Mechanicks,</HI> which explain the Nature of <HI>Bodies</HI> in <HI>general,</HI> and the <HI>Forces</HI> by which they move; and demonstrate the various Laws of their <HI>Motion.</HI> To which belong <HI>Staticks, Hydrostaticks</HI> and <HI>Pneumaticks.</HI> Upon which we proceed in <HI>Geology,</HI> or <HI>Physicks,</HI> strictly so called, to contemplate this <HI>Globe of Earth,</HI> in all its Parts and Furniture; the Ele∣ments, Fire, Air, Water and Earth; the Stones, Mines, Minerals, Meteors, Plants, and Ani∣mals, and particularly the wonderful Structure of our own Bodies. Here therefore belong, <HI>Opticks, is Musick, Geography, Navigation</HI> and <HI>Commerce; Lithology, Metallology</HI> and <HI>Meteorolo∣gy, Agriculture, Chemistry</HI> and <HI>Botanics, Anatomy, Surgery</HI> and <HI>Medici<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> and every Thing useful in Life. And, lastly, from the Earth we launch forth into the vast and unmeasurable Aether, and in <HI>Astronomy</HI> we contemplate the <HI>Heavens</HI> and <HI>Stars,</HI> both fixed and erratick; and particularly our <HI>Sun,</HI> with his splendid Chorus of <HI>Planets</HI> and <HI>Comets,</HI> with their Orbits, Magnitudes and Densities, and the Laws of their Motions in the Tides of their Fluids, and their diurnal and annual Revolutions: To which belong <HI>Chronolo∣gy</HI> and <HI>Dialling.</HI> And the <HI>Facts</HI> in all <HI>Nature</HI> are related in <HI>Natural History.</HI> "All which open upon us an amazing Scene, in which Nature dis∣plays her surprizing <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> and invites us heedfully to consider her wonderful Productions, and trace out infinite Wisdom, Power and Good∣ness, thro' the immense Spaces, from the Heights above to the Depths below, from the glorious
<PB N="xvii" REF="006859_0016_102A86924BA20318"/>
Orbs which roll over our Heads, to the minutest Insects that crawl under our Feet, and even Things either vastly minute or distant that escape the Ken of our naked Eye. From all which we are led to behold, acknowledge, admire and adore the great Author of all Things." And this pre∣pares us,</P>
<P N="13">13. (4.) TO proceed a Step higher, and from the <HI>Sensible</HI> or <HI>Natural World,</HI> to go on to the Contemplation of the <HI>Intelligent</HI> or <HI>Moral World;</HI> from the World of <HI>Bodies,</HI> to the World of <HI>Spirits,</HI> which, as such, being intelligent and moral Agents, are the great Subject of <HI>Ethics,</HI> or <HI>moral Philosophy.</HI> The Foundation of which is <HI>Pneumatology,</HI> or the Doctrine of <HI>Spirits;</HI> in which, we begin with our own Souls, their Pow∣ers and Operations, both perceptive and active; and thence proceed to other Orders of Intelli∣gences, and so gradually rise to the more particu∣lar Contemplation of the DEITY, the great Father of Spirits, and the supreme Lord and Go∣vernor of the whole Creation, which is called <HI>Theology.</HI> And when we have learn'd just No∣tions of Him and ourselves, we from thence de∣monstratively deduce the great Principles of that Duty which we owe to Him, ourselves and one another (which opens another glorious Scene of eternal Truth) the Performance of which, doth, in the Nature of it, tend to our highest Perfecti∣on and Happiness. All which great Branches of Duty are the Subject of <HI>Ethics</HI> (strictly so called) which is the Art of living happily by the univer∣sal Practice of Virtue. But these Things will be best learn'd from the <HI>Sacred Volumes,</HI> the Design and Business of which is to explain and inforce the great Principles of <HI>Theology</HI> and <HI>Morality</HI> by
<PB N="xviii" REF="006859_0017_102A869629F4F398"/>
<HI>Divine Revelation;</HI> particularly "our blessed Sa∣viour hath exalted <HI>Ethics</HI> to the sublimest Pitch, and his admirable Sermon in the Mount is the noblest and exactest Model of Perfection."</P>
<P N="14">14. (5.) <HI>Ethics</HI> explain the Laws of our Duty as we are Men in general, and which indeed are the eternal and immutable Laws of Right that equally bind all intelligent Creatures. But as we cannot well subsist without being combined into particular <HI>Societies:</HI> And as Societies are of two Kinds; the one founded in Nature, <HI>viz. Fami∣lies,</HI> the other in Compact, <HI>viz. Civil Govern∣ments:</HI> Hence spring two other Branches of <HI>Mo∣ral Philosophy,</HI> viz. <HI>Oeconomics,</HI> which relate to the Regulation of <HI>Families;</HI> and <HI>Politicks,</HI> which treat of the Constitution and good Government of <HI>Cities, Kingdoms</HI> and <HI>Republicks.</HI> And as good <HI>Policy</HI> provides for every Thing that may contribute to the publick Good and Happiness of Mankind, it does, in Effect, comprehend and sum up the whole of <HI>Philosophy.</HI> And, lastly, as it provides for the Happiness of Men, both <HI>Temporal</HI> and <HI>Spiritual,</HI> both with Regard to this Life, and that which is to come, it must con∣sist of two great Branches, <HI>viz. Civil</HI> and <HI>Eccle∣siastical Polity.</HI> And the Facts in the <HI>Moral World</HI> are related in <HI>Biography,</HI> and in <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiastical History.</HI> The whole may be seen in one View in the following Table.</P>

<HEAD><HI>NOETICA:</HI> OR The first PRINCIPLES of METAPHYSICS <HI>and</HI> LOGIC. Together with The <HI>Progress</HI> of the <HI>Human Mind</HI> towards its <HI>Perfection.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the</HI> Mind in general, <HI>its</HI> Objects <HI>and</HI> Operations.</HEAD>
<P N="1">§ 1. IT is my Design in the following Essay, to trace out,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Design.</NOTE> in as short a Compass as I can, the se∣veral Steps of the Mind of Man, from the first Impressions of Sense, through the seve∣ral Improvements it gradually makes, till it ar∣rives to that Perfection and Enjoyment of itself, which is the great End of its Being.—In order to which, it will first be expedient to define what we mean by the <HI>Human Mind,</HI> and to give some Account of its various Objects, Powers and Ope∣rations, and the Principles and Rules by which they are to be conducted in attaining to the Know∣ledge
<PB N="2" REF="006859_0025_102A86D10D7C4540"/>
of Truth, which is the Business of that Science which is called <HI>LOGIC,</HI> or <HI>The Art of Thinking</HI> or <HI>Reasoning;</HI> the Foundation of which is the <HI>Philosophia prima,</HI> which is also called <HI>Me∣taphysics</HI> and <HI>Ontology,</HI> or <HI>the Doctrine of the ge∣neral Notion of Being, with its various Properties and Affections,</HI> and <HI>those applied in general both to Body and Spirit.</HI> And as <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> are nearly allied, being in effect but the same Thing under different Considerations; this will pave the Way towards the Attainment of that supreme Good, in the Choice and Enjoyment of which consists our highest Happiness; the particular Consideration of which is the Business of <HI>Ethics,</HI> or <HI>Moral Philosophy,</HI> which is <HI>the Art of pursuing our highest Happiness by the universal Practice of Virtue.</HI></P>
<P N="2">§ 2. THE Word <HI>Mind</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> in general, signifies any <HI>intelligent active Being;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">The Defini∣tion of Mind.</NOTE> which Notion we take from what we are conscious of in ourselves, who know that we have within us a Prin∣ciple of conscious Perception, Intelligence, Acti∣vity and Self-exertion; or rather, that each of us is a conscious, perceptive, intelligent, active and Self-exerting Being: And by Reasoning and Ana∣logy from ourselves we apply it to all other Minds or Intelligences besides, or superior to us; and (removing all Limitations and Imperfections) we apply it even to that <HI>Great Supreme Intelligence,</HI> who is the universal Parent of all created Spirits, and (as far as our Words and Conceptions can go) may be defined, <HI>an infinite Mind</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> or <HI>a Being infinitely intelligent and active.</HI> But by the <HI>Human Mind,</HI> we mean that Principle of Sense, Intelligence and free Activity, which we feel with∣in
<PB N="3" REF="006859_0026_102A86D4E50470C0"/>
ourselves, or rather feel ourselves to be, fur¦nished with those Objects and Powers, and under those Confinements and Limitations, under which it hath pleased our great Creator to place us in this present State.</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. WE are, at present, <HI>Spirits</HI> or <HI>Minds</HI> connected with gross, <HI>tangible Bodies,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Uni∣on of Body and Mind.</NOTE> in such a Manner, that as our Bodies, can perceive and act nothing but by our Minds, so, on the other Hand, our Minds perceive and act by Means of our bo∣dily Organs. Such is the present Law of our Nature, which I conceive to be no other than a meer arbitrary Constitution or Establishment of Him that hath made us to be what we are.—And accordingly I apprehend that the Union between our Souls and Bodies, during our present State, consists in nothing else but this Law of our Na∣ture, which is the Will and perpetual <HI>Fiat</HI> of that infinite Parent Mind, who made, and <HI>holds our Souls in Life,</HI> and <HI>in whom we live, and move, and have our Being,</HI> viz. That our Bodies should be thus acted by our Minds, and that our Minds should thus perceive and act by the Organs of our Bodies, and under such Limitations as in fact we find ourselves to be attended with.</P>
<P N="4">§ 4. THE immediate Object of these our Per∣ceptions and Actions we call <HI>Ideas;</HI> as this Word has been commonly de∣fined and used by the Moderns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Definition of Idea, Notion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> with whom it signifies any immediate Ob∣ject of the Mind in Thinking, whe∣ther sensible or intellectual, and so is, in Effect, synonymous with the Word <HI>Thought,</HI> which com∣prehends both.—<HI>Plato,</HI> indeed, by the Word <HI>Idea,</HI> understood the original Exemplar of Things,
<PB N="4" REF="006859_0027_102A86D953BF30E8"/>
whether sensible or intellectual, in the eternal Mind, conformable to which all Things exist; or the abstract Essences of Things, as being Origi∣nals or <HI>Archetypes</HI> in that infinite Intellect, of which our Ideas or Conceptions are a Kind of Copies.—But perhaps, for the more distinct un∣derstanding ourselves upon this Subject, it may be best to confine the Word <HI>Idea</HI> to the immedi∣ate Objects of Sense and Imagination, which was the original Meaning of it; and to use the Word <HI>Notion</HI> or <HI>Conception,</HI> to signify the Objects of Consciousness and pure Intellect, tho' both of them may be expressed by the general Term <HI>Thought;</HI> for these are so entirely, and <HI>toto Coelo</HI> different and distinct one from the other, that it may be apt to breed Confusion in our Thoughts and Language, to use the same Word promiscu∣ously for them both; tho' we are indeed general∣ly obliged to substitute sensible Images and the Words annexed to them, to represent Things purely intellectual; such, for Instance, are the Words, <HI>Spirit, Reflect, Conceive, Discourse,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. OUR Minds may be said to be created meer <HI>Tabulae rasae;</HI> i. e. They have no Notices of any Objects of any Kind properly created in them,<NOTE PLACE="marg">The Origi∣nal of our Ideas.</NOTE> or concre∣ated with them: Yet I apprehend, that in all the Notices they have of any Kind of Objects, they have an immediate Dependance upon the Deity, as really as they depend upon Him for their Existence; <HI>i. e.</HI> They are no more Authors to themselves of the Objects of their Perceptions, or the Light by which they perceive them, than of the Power of Perceiving itself; but that they perceive them by a perpetual Inter∣course
<PB N="5" REF="006859_0028_102A86E2DB950130"/>
with that great Parent Mind, to whose incessant Agency they are entirely passive, both in all the Perceptions of Sense, and in all that in∣tellectual Light by which they perceive the Ob∣jects of the pure Intellect.—Notwithstanding which, it is plain from Experience, that in Con∣sequence of these Perceptions they are entirely at Liberty to act, or not to act, and all their Actions flow from a Principle of Self-exertion.—But in order the better to understand these Things, I must more particularly define these Terms.— And, as all the Notices we have in our Minds derive to them originally from (or rather by Means of) these two Fountains, <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>Con∣sciousness,</HI> it is necessary to begin with them.</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. BY <HI>Sense,</HI> we mean, those Perceptions we have of Objects <HI>ab extra,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Sen∣ses;</NOTE> or by Means of the several Organs of our Bodies.—Thus, by <HI>Feeling</HI> or Touch, we perceive an endless Variety of <HI>tangible Ob∣jects, Resistance, Extension, Figure, Motion, Hard, Soft, Heat, Cold,</HI> &amp;c. By <HI>Sight</HI> we perceive <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Colours,</HI> with all their endlesly various Modifications, <HI>Red, Blue, Green,</HI> &amp;c.—By <HI>Hear∣ing,</HI> we perceive <HI>Sounds:</HI>—By <HI>Tasting, Sapors:</HI>— By <HI>Smelling, Odours,</HI> &amp;c.—These are called <HI>Sim∣ple Ideas.</HI>—And of these, sorted out into a vast Variety of fixed Combinations, or <HI>Compound Ideas,</HI> distinct from each other, and in which they are always found to co-exist, consists every Sort and individual <HI>Body</HI> in Nature, such as we call <HI>Man, Horse, Tree, Stone, Apple, Cherry,</HI> &amp;c.—And of all these various distinct Combinations or Com∣pounds, connected together in such a Manner as to constitute one most beautiful, useful and har∣monious Whole, consists what we call <HI>Universal Nature,</HI> or the intire <HI>sensible</HI> or <HI>natural World.</HI></P>
<P N="7"><PB N="6" REF="006859_0029_102A86E99B2F3698"/>§ 7. IN the Perception of these Ideas or Objects of Sense,<NOTE PLACE="marg">In which we are pas∣sive.</NOTE> we find our Minds are meerly passive, it not being in our Power (supposing our Organs rightly disposed and situated) whether we will see Light and Colours, hear Sounds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> We are not Causes to ourselves of these Perceptions, nor can they be produced in our Minds without a Cause; or (which is the same Thing) by any imagined unintelligent, inert, or unactive Cause (which indeed is a Contradiction in Terms) from whence it is Demonstration that they must derive to us from an Almighty, intelligent active Cause, exhibiting them to us, impressing our Minds with them, or producing them in us; and consequent∣ly (as I intimated) it must be by a perpetual In∣tercourse of our Minds with the DEITY, the great Author of our Beings, or by His perpetual Influence or Activity upon them, that they are possessed of all these Objects of Sense, and the Light by which we perceive them.</P>
<P N="8">§ 8. THESE Ideas or Objects of Sense are commonly supposed to be Pictures or Representations of Things without us,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Ideas of Sense not Pictures, but the real Things.</NOTE> and indeed external to any Mind, e∣ven that of the Deity himself, and the Truth or Reality of them is con∣ceived to consist in their being exact Pictures of Things or Objects without us, which are supposed to be the real Things.—But as it is impossible for us to know what is without our Minds, and consequently, what those supposed Originals are, and whether these Ideas of ours are just Resemblances of them or not; I am afraid this Notion of them will lead us into an inextrica∣ble Scepticism. I am therefore apt to think that
<PB N="7" REF="006859_0030_102A86F3605ADA28"/>
these Ideas, or immediate Objects of Sense, are the real Things, at least all that we are concern∣ed with, I mean, of the sensible Kind; and that the Reality of them consists in their Stability and Consistence, or their being, in a stable Manner, exhibited to our Minds, or produced in them, and in a steady Connection with each other, con∣formable to certain fixed Laws of Nature, which the great <HI>Father of Spirits</HI> hath established to Himself, according to which He constantly ope∣rates and affects our Minds, and from which He will not vary, unless upon extraordinary Oc∣casions, as in the Case of Miracles.</P>
<P N="9">§ 9. THUS, for Instance, there is a fixed sta∣ble Connection between <HI>Things tangible</HI> and <HI>Things visible,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Instanced in Things visible and tangible.</NOTE> or the immediate Objects of <HI>Touch</HI> and <HI>Sight,</HI> depend∣ing, as I conceive, immediately upon the permanent, most wise and Al∣mighty Will and <HI>Fiat</HI> of the great Creator and Preserver of the World. By which, neither can it be meant, that visible Objects are Pictures of tangible Objects (which yet is all the Sense that can be made of our Ideas of Sense being Images of real Things without us) for they are entirely different and distinct Things; as different as the sound <HI>Triangle,</HI> and the Figure signified by it; so different, that a Man born blind, and made to see, could have no more Notion that a visible Globe hath any Connection with a tangible Globe, by meer Sight, without being taught, than a <HI>French∣man</HI> that should come into <HI>England,</HI> and hear the Word <HI>Man,</HI> could imagine, without being taught, that it signified the same Thing with the Word <HI>Homme,</HI> in his Language.—All that can be meant by it, therefore, is, That, as <HI>tangible Things</HI> are
<PB N="8" REF="006859_0031_102A86F82DDCB900"/>
the Things immediately capable of producing (or rather, being attended with) sensible Pleasure or Pain in us, according to the present Laws of our Nature, on Account of which they are conceived of as being properly the <HI>real Things;</HI> so the im∣mediate <HI>Objects of Sight</HI> or <HI>visible Things,</HI> are al∣ways, by the same stable Law of our Nature, connected with them, as Signs of them, and ever correspondent and proportioned to them; <HI>Visible Extension, Figure, Motion,</HI> &amp;c. with those of the <HI>tangible Kind,</HI> which go by the same Names; and so in the Compounds or Combinations of them; the visible <HI>Man, Horse, Tree, Stone,</HI> &amp;c. with those of the tangible Kind, signified by the same Names.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Bp.</HI> Berkeley's Theories of Vision, Principles of Hu∣man Knowledge, <HI>and</HI> Three Dialogues.</NOTE></P>
<P N="10">§ 10. NOT that it is to be doubted but that there are <HI>Archetypes</HI> of these sensible I∣deas existing,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Arche∣types.</NOTE> external to our Minds; but then they must exist in some other Mind, and be Ideas also as well as ours; because an Idea can resemble nothing but an Idea; and an Idea ever implies in the very Nature of it, Re∣lation to a Mind perceiving it, or in which it ex∣ists. But then those Archetypes or Originals, and the Manner of their Existence in that eternal Mind, must be intirely different from that of their Exi∣stence in our Minds; as different, as the Manner of His Existence is from that of ours: In Him they must exist, as in original Intellect; in us, only by Way of Sense and Imagination; and in Him, as Originals; in us, only as faint Copies; such as he thinks fit to communicate to us, ac∣cording to such Laws and Limitations as he hath established, and such as are sufficient to all the
<PB N="9" REF="006859_0032_102A86FE9B0D3778"/>
Purposes relating to our Well-being, in which on∣ly we are concerned. Our Ideas, therefore, can no otherwise be said to be Images or Copies of the Archetypes in the eternal Mind, than as our Souls are said to be Images of Him, or as we are said to be <HI>made after his Image.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See on this Head, <HI>Norris's Ideal World.</HI> Part 1.</NOTE></P>

Thus I am conscious that I perceive <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Colours, Sounds, Odours, Sapors,</HI> and <HI>tangible Qualities,</HI> with all the various Combinations of them; and that of these, some give me, or rather are attended with <HI>Pain</HI> or Uneasiness, others with <HI>Pleasure</HI> or Ease, and the comfortable Enjoyment of myself. I find, moreover, that when I have had any Per∣ception or Impression of Sense, I retain a faint <HI>Image</HI> of it in my Mind afterwards, or have a Kind of internal Sense or Remembrance of it; as having seen the <HI>Sun,</HI> a <HI>Flower,</HI> a <HI>Horse,</HI> or a <HI>Man,</HI> I retain the Image of their Figure, Shape, Colour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> afterwards. Thus I have now a faint Idea of the <HI>Sun</HI> at Midnight, and of a <HI>Rose</HI> in Winter: I know how such a <HI>Tree,</HI> such a <HI>Horse,</HI> or such a <HI>Man</HI> looks, tho' I have neither of them before my Eyes. This Power of the Mind is cal∣led <HI>Imagination</HI> and <HI>Memory,</HI> which implies a Con∣sciousness of the original Impression (tho' indeed

the Word <HI>Memory</HI> may imply the Recollection of intellectual as well as sensible Objects, but chiefly those by Means of these, which is also called <HI>Reminiscence</HI>) and these Ideas of the Imagination may be truly said to be Images or Pictures of the Ideas or immediate Objects of Sense. We are moreover conscious of a Power whereby we can, not only imagine Things as being what they real∣ly are in Nature, but can also join such Parts and Properties of Things together, as never co-existed in Nature, but are meer Creatures of our Minds, or Chimeras; as the Head of a Man with the Body of an Horse, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which must also be referred to the Imagination, but as influ∣enced by the Will.</P>
<P N="12">§ 12. BUT besides these Powers of <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>Imagination,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the pure Intellect, and its Acts.</NOTE> we are conscious of what is called the <HI>pure Intellect,</HI> or the Pow∣er of conceiving of abstracted or <HI>spi∣ritual Objects,</HI> and the <HI>Relations</HI> be∣tween our several Ideas and Concepti∣ons, and the various Dispositions, Exertions and Actions of our Minds, and the complex Notions resulting from all these; of all which we cannot be properly said to have <HI>Ideas,</HI> they being in∣tirely of a different Kind from the Objects of Sense and Imagination, on which Account I would rather call them <HI>Notions</HI> or <HI>Conceptions.</HI> And they are either <HI>simple,</HI> such as <HI>Perception, Consciousness, Volition, Affection, Action,</HI> &amp;c. or <HI>complex,</HI> as <HI>Spirit, Soul, God, Cause, Effect, Proportion, Ju∣stice, Charity,</HI> &amp;c.

<PB N="11" REF="006859_0034_102A8707EE3FCC48"/>
active Powers, whereof we are conscious within ourselves; such as, 1. The <HI>simple Apprehension</HI> of Objects, and their several Relations, Conecti∣ons and Dependencies, arising from our compar∣ing our Ideas and Conceptions one with another. 2. <HI>Judging</HI> of <HI>true</HI> or <HI>false,</HI> according as Things appear to agree or disagree, to be connected or not connected one with another; and 3. <HI>Reasoning</HI> or inferring one Thing from another, and methodiz∣ing them according to their Connections and Or∣der: All which are the Subject of <HI>Logics.</HI> To which succeed, 1. <HI>Affecting</HI> or <HI>Disaffecting</HI> them according as they appear <HI>good</HI> or <HI>bad,</HI> agreeable or disagreeable to us, <HI>i. e.</HI> attended with Plea∣sure or Uneasiness. 2. <HI>Willing</HI> or <HI>Nilling, Chusing</HI> or <HI>Refusing</HI> according as we affect or disaffect them. 3. <HI>Liberty</HI> of <HI>Acting,</HI> or forbearing to act in Consequence of the Judgment and Choice we have made of them: All which are the Sub∣ject of <HI>Ethics.</HI> It is necessary to define all these Terms, and give some Account of these several Acts and Exertions of our Minds (which, as well as those of Sense, Consciousness, Imagination and Memory above-mentioned, are only so many Modifications of them) in order to what is next to follow.</P>

or is received in our Imagination, or apprehended by our Understand∣ing, but we are immediately conscious of a Kind of <HI>intellectual Light</HI> within us (if I may so call it) whereby we not only know that we perceive the Object, but directly apply ourselves to the Consideration of it, both in itself, its Pro∣perties
<PB N="12" REF="006859_0035_102A870BD6CE45A8"/>
and Powers, and as it stands related to all other Things. And we find that as we are ena∣bled by this <HI>intellectual Light</HI> to perceive these Objects and their various Relations, in like Man∣ner as by <HI>sensible Light</HI> we are enabled to per∣ceive the Objects of Sense and their various Si∣tuations;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Plato's</HI>'s Doctrine, in his <HI>Epinomis,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>
so our Minds are as passive to this <HI>in∣tellectual Light,</HI> as they are to <HI>sensible Light,</HI> and can no more withstand the Evidence of it, than they can withstand the Evidence of Sense. Thus I am under the same Necessity to assent to this, That <HI>I am</HI> or have a Being, and that I <HI>perceive</HI> and <HI>freely exert myself,</HI> as I am of assenting to this, That I <HI>see Colours</HI> or <HI>hear Sounds.</HI> I am as perfectly sure that 2+2=4, or that the <HI>Whole is equal to all its Parts,</HI> as that I <HI>feel Heat</HI> or <HI>Cold,</HI> or that I <HI>see the Sun</HI> when I look full on it in the Meridian in a clear Day; <HI>i. e.</HI> I am intuitively certain of both.—This intellectual Light I con∣ceive of as it were a <HI>Medium</HI> of Knowledge, as sensible Light is of Sight:—In both there is the <HI>Power</HI> of perceiving, and the <HI>Object</HI> per∣ceived; and this is the <HI>Medium</HI> by which I am enabled to know it.—And this <HI>Light</HI> is one, and common to all intelligent Beings, and <HI>enlighteneth</HI> alike, <HI>every Man that cometh into the World,</HI> a <HI>Chinese,</HI> or <HI>Japonese,</HI> as well as an <HI>European</HI> or <HI>American,</HI> and an <HI>Angel</HI> as well as a <HI>Man:</HI> By which they all at once see the same Thing to be true or right in all Places at the same Time, and alike invariably in all Times, past, present, and to come.</P>
<P N="14">§ 14. NOW if it be asked, Whence does this Light derive, whereby all created Minds at once perceive, as by a common Standard, the same
<PB N="13" REF="006859_0036_102A871089FE1EE8"/>
Things alike to be true and right?—I answer, I have no other Way to conceive how I come to be affected with this intui∣tive intellectual Light,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whence it is derived.</NOTE> whereof I am conscious, than by deriving it from the universal Presence and Action of the DEITY, or a per∣petual Communication with the great <HI>Father of Lights,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Archbishop</HI> of <HI>Cambray,</HI> on this Subject, in his Demonstration of the Existence of God. And <HI>Norris</HI> or <HI>Malbranch.</HI></NOTE> or rather his eternal <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Spirit.</HI>— For I know I am not the Author of it to myself, being passive and not active with regard to it, tho' I am active in Consequence of it.—There∣fore, tho' I cannot explain the Manner how I am impressed with it (as neither can I that of Sense) I do humbly conceive that God does as truly and immediately enlighten my Mind inter∣nally to know these intellectual Objects, as he does by the Light of the <HI>Sun</HI> (his sensible Repre∣sentative) enable me to perceive sensible Objects. So that those Expressions are indeed no less Phi∣losophical than Devout, that GOD <HI>is Light, and in his Light we see Light.</HI>—And this intuitive Knowledge, as far as it goes, must be the <HI>first Principles,</HI> from which the Mind takes its Rise, and upon which it proceeds in all its subsequent Improvements in Reasoning, and discovering both Truth in Speculation, and Right in Action; so that this intellectual Light must be primarily and carefully attended to, if we would avoid and be secure from either Error or Vice.—Nor must this Manner of Thinking be suspected to savour of <HI>Enthusiasm,</HI> it being the settled Course or Law of Nature, according to which the great Parent Mind enlighteneth us; and that in Things, in
<PB N="14" REF="006859_0037_102A8712D8F2F680"/>
their own Nature capable of clear Evidence; whereas <HI>Enthusiasm</HI> implies an <HI>imaginary,</HI> as <HI>Re∣velation</HI> is a real and well-attested adventitious Light, above and beyond the settled Law or Course of Nature, discovering Truths not other∣wise knowable, and giving Directions, or enjoin∣ing Rules of Action in Things arbitrary, or Mat∣ters of meer Institution.—And from this intuitive intellectual Light it is (as I conceive) that we de∣rive what we call <HI>Taste</HI> and <HI>Judgment,</HI> and, with respect to Morals, what some call the moral Sense or the Conscience, which are only a Sort of quick intuitive Sense or Apprehension of the Decent and Amiable, of Beauty and Deformity, of True and False, and of Right and Wrong, or Duty and Sin: And it is the chief Business of Culture, Art and Instruction, to awaken and turn our Attention to it, and assist us in making Deducti∣ons from it.</P>

<PB N="15" REF="006859_0038_102A87181A955FC8"/>
and <HI>Infinite, Possible</HI> and <HI>Impossible, Perfect</HI> and <HI>Imperfect, Truth</HI> and <HI>Good, Beauty</HI> and <HI>Harmony, Substances</HI> and <HI>Accidents, Subjects</HI> and <HI>Adjuncts, Time</HI> and <HI>Place, Whole</HI> and <HI>Parts, Unity</HI> and <HI>Multiplicity, Number</HI> and <HI>Order, Identity</HI> and <HI>Di∣versity,</HI> Things <HI>Agreeing</HI> and <HI>Opposite, Equal</HI> and <HI>Unequal, Like</HI> and <HI>Unlike, Denomination</HI> and <HI>De∣finition, Individuals</HI> and <HI>Abstraction, Kinds</HI> and <HI>Sorts, Bodies</HI> and <HI>Spirits;</HI> and lastly, of <HI>Metaphor</HI> and <HI>Analogy</HI> from Things sensible to Things spi∣ritual, and from Things human to Things di∣vine.—Of all which I shall treat in the Order as they are here enumerated.</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. AS soon as the Mind is possessed of any Variety of Objects,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Being in general.</NOTE> being assisted with that inward intellectual Light above∣mentioned, deriving, and, as it were, perpetually beaming forth from the great Foun∣tain of all Light, both sensible and intellectual, it immediately falls to contemplating its Ideas and Conceptions, and comparing them one with another.—And here, the first Thing it is en∣lightened to know or be conscious of, is, its own Existence from the Existence of its Perceptions and Exertions and their Objects, which it conceives of as real <HI>Beings</HI> or <HI>Things,</HI> whence it gets the No∣tion of <HI>Being</HI> in general.—But even this first Ob∣ject of its Knowledge it is made to know from that first Principle of intellectual Light, flowing from the Parent Mind, <HI>That Perception and Ac∣tion, and being perceived or acted upon, implies Ex∣istence,</HI> of which Principle it has an inward intuitive Sense and Certainty. Hence it immediately infers, <HI>I perceive and act, therefore I am: I perceive such an Object, therefore it is,</HI> &amp;c. Not that its Exi∣stence depends on my Mind, but on that Mind
<PB N="16" REF="006859_0039_102A871D86B58F50"/>
by whom I am enabled to perceive it. And as per∣ceiving and acting, and being perceived and acted upon, implies Existence or <HI>Being,</HI> so it <HI>is a Contra∣diction for the same Thing to be and not to be at the same Time,</HI> for that would be to perceive and not perceive, to act and not to act, and to be per∣ceived and not perceived, and acted upon and not acted upon, at one and the same Time: And from these Definitions arise that first great Di∣stinction of <HI>Being</HI> into <HI>Spirit</HI> and <HI>Body,</HI> whereof the Existence of the first consists in perceiving and acting, and that of the other in being passive∣ly perceived and acted.—And here, to perceive or to act is called the <HI>Power,</HI> and what is per∣ceived or acted upon, is called the <HI>Object.</HI>—So that by <HI>Being,</HI> is meant, what really IS or exists, in Opposition to what is merely fictitious or ima∣ginary; a Creature of our own Minds, and not of him that made and enables us to perceive and act.</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. NOW of every Thing that <HI>IS,</HI> it must be said,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the first Being and eternal Truth.</NOTE> either, That it <HI>always was,</HI> or, that it <HI>began to be.</HI>—If it always was, or never derived from the Pow∣er of any other Being, it must be in∣dependent of every other Being what∣soever, and consequently must exist absolutely by the intrinsic Necessity of its own Nature, or be a necessarily existent Being, and all other Beings must depend on its Will and Power, otherwise they could never have been, or continue to be; and Itself, being derived from no other Being, and dependent on none, it must be out of the Power of any other Being to limit or controul it, and consequently it must be <HI>infinite</HI> and <HI>eter∣nal; i. e.</HI> must have all Reality, Perfection and
<PB N="17" REF="006859_0040_102A8722B75D6E70" MS="y"/>
Fulness of Being, without any regard to Time or Place: For that must be <HI>infinite,</HI> that has, and can have no possible Bounds or Limitations; and that must be <HI>eternal,</HI> that is, and always was, and will be, and can't but be; and such a Being must be <HI>All in All;</HI> all Reality and Excellency.—Nor can there be more than <HI>One</HI> such Being, who is Being itself, because it is a manifest Contradiction that two or more Beings should, each have in it, or consist of, all possible Reality and Perfection. He must therefore be a perfect <HI>Unity,</HI> the ΤΟ Ε''Ν, and the ΤΟ 'ΩΝ, and the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, as the Ancients called Him, which is the true Import of the ori∣ginal sacred Names <HI>JAH</HI> and <HI>JEHOVAH.</HI> And He is also called <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good:</HI>—<HI>Truth</HI> itself, as He is all Reality; and <HI>Good</HI> itself, as He is all Perfection and Excellency.—And He is <HI>Truth</HI> as He is infinitely intelligible, and <HI>Good</HI> as He is infinitely eligible, containing within and of Himself, all that can contribute to render Himself happy, as well as all other perceptive, conscious, active Beings, dependent on Him.—In this necessarily existent and eternal Being or Mind must originally exist all those necessary and eternal Truths with which our Minds are furnished, ei∣ther by Intuition or Demonstration; such as these, That <HI>Perception and Action imply Existence:</HI>—That <HI>what begins to be, must have a Cause:</HI>—That <HI>the Whole is equal to all its Parts:</HI>—That <HI>all the Rays of a Circle are equal:</HI>—That <HI>what is right or wrong in another towards me, must be equally right or wrong in me towards him,</HI> &amp;c.—We know that these and the like eternal Truths do not de∣pend on our Minds, or the actual Existence of Things, but must have an eternal and necessary Existence, antecedent to our Knowledge of them,
<PB N="18" REF="006859_0041_102A87285ADC28E0"/>
and independent of it, or of any particular Exi∣stence.—And as we can have no Notion of Truth without a Mind perceiving it, their necessary and eternal Existence must infer the necessary Existence of an eternal Mind; and consequently, it must be in that eternal Mind that we behold them, or rather by our Communication with Him that we are enlightened with the Knowledge of them.— In Him they must exist as one archetypal and eternal Light of Truth; but as they are from Him reflected on the various Objects in our finite Minds, they appear various and manifold, as sen∣sible Light is one in the Sun, tho' it becomes va∣rious Colours and other sensible Qualities in diffe∣rent Objects.</P>
<P N="4">§ 4. ON the contrary, Whatever Being <HI>be∣gan to be,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Causes &amp; Effects.</NOTE> must have had a <HI>Cause,</HI> and depend on some other Being for its Existence.—By the Word <HI>Cause,</HI> we mean, that Being by whose Design and Activity, Force or Exertion, another Being exists: And that Being which exists by the Design, Force, Action, or Exertion of another, is called an <HI>Ef∣fect;</HI> what is called an Effect therefore must be supposed not to have existed, and consequently to have had a Beginning of Existence, or at least a dependent Existence, and must therefore have had a Cause, by the Force or Activity of which it came into Existence, and without which it would not have been.—And this must be the Case of every Thing that is, till you come to a <HI>first Cause, i. e.</HI> to a Being that never had a Be∣ginning, or any dependent Existence, but exists by the absolute Necessity of its own Nature, having an original perfect Fulness of Being in and of itself, without depending on any other Being, and deals out Being and Perfection to all
<PB N="19" REF="006859_0042_102A872C9A330418"/>
other Beings, in various Measures and Degrees as pleaseth him.—And such a Being there must be, otherwise nothing could ever have been, unless you suppose a Thing to be its own Cause, <HI>i. e. To act before it is, which is impossible;</HI> or unless you suppose an infinite Succession of Causes and Effects, which in effect would be an infinite Ef∣fect without any Cause at all: <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Wollaston's Rel. of Nat.</HI> p. 65, &amp;c.</NOTE> But <HI>an Effect without a Cause, is a Contradiction in Terms;</HI> for, by the Definition, to every Thing that is pro∣duced, there must be a correspondent Power ade∣quate to the Production of it, or an active Force, sufficient to produce it.—And here, the Thing existing is said to be a Thing <HI>in Act;</HI> and as the Force producing adequate to the Effect, is called the Power, so the Effect not yet produced, is said to be in Power, or <HI>in fieri,</HI> and the Being which exerts that Power, we call an <HI>Agent</HI> and <HI>Active,</HI> and that on or in which the Force termi∣nates, we call a <HI>Patient</HI> and <HI>Passive.</HI></P>
<P N="5">§ 5. THERE are indeed many Things that occur to our Senses and Thoughts,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of real and apparent Causes.</NOTE>
that appear at first Sight to be Agents or Causes, which, strictly speaking, are not so, as we find upon a more exact Scrutiny, though they are vulgarly so cal∣led. Thus we say, <HI>The Sun moves, rises and sets,</HI> when yet upon a more thorough Enquiry we find, it is not the Action of the Sun, but these Appear∣ances are occasioned by the Motion of the Earth, and that they are only meer passive Appearances in our Minds. So we say, the <HI>Fire burns;</HI> the <HI>Sun warms, enlivens, ripens the Fruits,</HI> &amp;c. and we call <HI>the Parent the Cause of his Offspring;</HI> where∣as, upon a more strict Enquiry, we find that he is by no Means the adequate Cause; and that the
<PB N="20" REF="006859_0043_102A87328677F9B0"/>
<HI>Sun,</HI> and (what we call) other natural Causes, are in themselves but meer passive inert Beings, con∣nected one with another, according to the esta∣blished Laws of Nature; so that being Things meerly passive and inert, they cannot, properly speaking, be the Causes of the Effects vulgarly ascribed to them; they must therefore be called only <HI>Signs, Occasions, Means,</HI> or <HI>Instruments,</HI> and we must look for some other Being in whom re∣sides, and by whom must be exerted, that ade∣quate Power or Force by which the Effect is tru∣ly produced, which therefore is the true and <HI>real Cause;</HI> and the other can only be called the <HI>appa∣rent</HI> Causes, having no real Efficiency or Activity in the Production of the Effect.</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. MOREOVER we find from what we ex∣perience in ourselves,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of necessa∣ry and vo∣luntary Causes.</NOTE> that we breathe and our Blood circulates without any Design or Activity of ours; and the Course of Nature without us, goes on whether we will or not, and even tho' we should exert our utmost Force to with∣stand it. These, with regard to us, may be called <HI>necessary Effects,</HI> as not depending on our Will and Power; tho' with regard to the true Author of Nature, they are free and <HI>voluntary Effects.</HI>—On the other Hand, we walk, speak, write, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> from a Principle of conscious designed Self-exertion, and voluntary Activity; these there∣fore are called free or voluntary Effects with re∣gard to us, which we produce or not, as we please; in doing which we are voluntary Causes. Hence we learn to make the Distinction between <HI>necessary</HI> and <HI>voluntary,</HI> or <HI>free Causes</HI> and <HI>Effects.</HI> So that by voluntary Effects, we mean, such as are produced by a free voluntary Cause acting
<PB N="21" REF="006859_0044_102A8734161EC7E0"/>
from a Principle of conscious Design and Self-exertion, exciting a Force of its own, or from within itself, which it chuseth to exert, and might do otherwise; and this is properly called a <HI>Cause,</HI> an efficient Cause or <HI>Agent.</HI> And as to those <HI>natu∣ral Effects</HI> abovementioned, of which the appa∣rent is not the real Cause, having neither Design nor Force in itself (as the Water in turning a Mill) but is rather acted than acts; however necessary they are with regard to us, yet from the most wise Design and Contrivance manifestly appearing in the Effects themselves, we evidently discern that the Being who is their true and adequate Cause, must be furnished with Wisdom and Power equal or sufficient for the Production of them, and must act from a Principle of free Self-exertion, and with a Design or View at some certain End proposed to himself in acting, and therefore be a free intelligent and <HI>voluntary</HI> Cause, for <HI>nothing can give what it hath not.</HI></P>
<P N="7">§ 7. WHENCE it appears, that only <HI>intelligent active</HI> Beings or Spirits,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of final Causes.</NOTE> can be truly <HI>efficient Causes,</HI> which alone are pro∣perly called <HI>Causes,</HI> and that when we speak of <HI>natural Causes,</HI> it is only in Accommo∣dation to vulgar Apprehensions, since they are meerly passive, and act, or rather are acted, with∣out any Design or Exertion of their own.—And as to what are commonly called <HI>final Causes,</HI> they are only the Views or Motives, determining the Design or Purpose of the efficient Cause, but have properly no Causality or Activity in themselves. We are conscious, when we produce any Effect, that we act with some End, View, or Design, which determineth us, or rather, properly speak∣ing, upon the View of which we determine our∣selves,
<PB N="22" REF="006859_0045_102A87405A2DA900"/>
to act so rather than otherwise, and to chuse and make use of such and such Means, ra∣ther than others, as being most fit and useful in order to accomplish our End; and therefore we say, <HI>He that wills the End, must will the Means conducing to the Attainment of it;</HI> the Effect to be produced being the <HI>ultimate</HI> End, and the Means the <HI>subordinate</HI> Ends which we have in View. — And herein consists the proper Notion of <HI>Wis∣dom,</HI> viz. In <HI>the right Judgment and Choice of Ends and Means; the best Ends and the fittest Means; and in a vigorous Activity in the Appli∣cation of the Means in order to attain the End.</HI>— Thus it is in human Affairs; and from what we observe in the Course of Nature, in which there is an evident Subordination of Ends and Means, we unavoidably infer that there must be something analogous to this in the Author of it, not because He needs Means for Himself, but that He may make the Series or Course of Na∣ture the more intelligible and instructive to us.— Hence the best Part of the Study of Nature must consist in the Discovery, as far as we are able, of what are called <HI>final Causes; i. e.</HI> of the plain Signatures of Design and Contrivance, and the Dependance and Connection of Ends and Means.</P>
<P N="8">§ 8. IN <HI>artificial Effects,</HI> or those produced by Man,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Matter and Form.</NOTE> as in Building, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by reason of our Impotence we need <HI>Matter</HI> to work upon, and a <HI>Form</HI> or Model to work by, according to which the Effect, being framed or formed out of the pre-existent Mate∣rials, is said to consist of Matter and Form, which have also been reckoned among the Causes, and they may each be called <HI>Causa fine quâ non,</HI> as the Schoolmen used to speak; but they cannot
<PB N="23" REF="006859_0046_102A87446E8B7F30"/>
be properly called Causes, as having no Force or Design in producing the Effect; we may, how∣ever, from hence, by Analogy, in speaking of o∣ther Things, advantageously make use of what is called, the <HI>Ratio Materialis,</HI> and <HI>Formalis</HI> of Things in Nature, and even of Things purely intellectual.—And because we need <HI>Matter</HI> and <HI>Form</HI> in producing <HI>artificial Effects,</HI> we are apt to think, or at least to speak as tho' we thought, this the Method of the Almighty in producing <HI>na∣tural Effects,</HI> but this is owing to our Weakness, whereby we are apt to measure Him by ourselves. Indeed he may be said to have a Form, Idea, or <HI>Archetype</HI> in his infinite, all-comprehending Mind, conformable to which he acts; but this can mean no more than that all Things which he produceth are always present with Him, and perfectly known to Him, with all their Relations and Connections, antecedent to their Production, and that He pro∣duceth them conformable to His own Know∣ledge, Design and Contrivance, being the Plan which he hath formed.—And that Existence of Things in the divine eternal Mind (if it may be so called) as being perfectly known to Him, an∣tecedent to their Production, is called their <HI>Arche∣typal State;</HI> and their Existence in <HI>Rerum Natu∣ra,</HI> as being actually produced by His Will and Power, and thereby perceived and known to us, is called their <HI>Ectypal State.</HI></P>

in the Mind of an intelligent Being, or existing in <HI>Rerum Natura.</HI> Thus the Essence of <HI>Gold</HI> consists in its Colour, Weight, Fixedness, Ductility, Solubility in <HI>Aqua Regia,</HI> or whatever Properties are always found to co-exist in that Sort of Body which we call <HI>Gold,</HI> and no other: So the Essence of a <HI>Rose</HI> consists in such a parti∣cular Figure, Odour, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—of a <HI>Man,</HI> in an intelligent active Power, joined with an animal Body, of such a particular Shape, and Configu∣ration of Parts:—of a <HI>Triangle,</HI> in three Sides, joining at three Angles:—of <HI>Justice,</HI> in rendering to every one his Due, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—In short, whatsoever goes to the <HI>Definition</HI> of a Thing, so as to give it a clear and necessary Discrimination from all other Things, we call the <HI>Essence</HI> of it, whether in fact it exist or not. Thus we have as clear an Idea of a <HI>Rose</HI> in Winter, as in <HI>June,</HI> when it is before our Eyes, and under our Noses; and as fixed and stable a Notion of a <HI>Triangle, Circle, Justice,</HI> or <HI>Charity,</HI> even upon Supposition that the Figures and Actions which go by those Names, do not exist in Nature or Fact, as if they did.

—By Things <HI>contingent,</HI> we mean, such as depend on the free Exertion of the Wills and Powers of intelligent active Beings, and which therefore might not have been, had they so plea∣sed, and consequently their Existence is precari∣ous and dependent.—Thus, That I sit here, and whether I shall sit here an Hour longer, or not, is contingent, as depending on the Freedom of my own Will to do so, or not, as I please: Whe∣ther the Sun will rise To-morrow, is contingent, as depending on the free Exertion of the Will of the Deity, who may, if he pleaseth, this Mo∣ment put an End to the whole Course of Nature. And thus the Existence of the whole Creation is contingent and precarious, as deriving from, and dependent on, the meer Will and Power of GOD, who if He pleased, might not have commanded Things into Being, and may cease to Will their Continuance when He pleaseth. Whereas by Things <HI>necessary,</HI> we mean such as can't but be, which must be understood either with regard to our Power, or that of the Deity. Thus, with re∣gard to our Power, it can't but be that Things are as they are, and as He hath made them, and that the Course of Nature proceeds as it does, and as He hath ordered it, which therefore, tho' not so in itself, to us is necessary and <HI>Fate.</HI> But that only is absolutely necessary in itself, the Non-existence of which would imply an Absurdity and Contradiction; and nothing else is thus absolute∣ly necessary besides the Deity Himself, the ne∣cessarily existent Being, without whom nothing could ever have existed; and eternal Truths which are founded in the Perfection of his Na∣ture, independent of any other Mind whatsoever; as, that the <HI>Whole</HI> is <HI>bigger</HI> than either <HI>of its Parts:</HI> That <HI>all the Rays of every Circle are equal:</HI>

or Thing is <HI>perfect,</HI> when it hath all the Parts, Properties or Powers, that a Thing of that Na∣ture ought to have in order to constitute it in that Kind of Being, and to render it capable of an∣swering the End of its being: As a Man is said to be perfect, that has all the Parts and Powers that a Man, as such, ought to have, so as to an∣swer the general End of his Being; <HI>i. e.</HI> some good Degree of Happiness:—He is then said to be perfect in his Kind, tho' some of the same Kind may have their Properties and Powers in a greater Degree of Perfection than others, and so be perfecter in <HI>Degree,</HI> tho' not in <HI>Kind,</HI> and con∣sequently capable of answering some nobler Ends, with regard both to themselves and others, as enjoying or communicating certain higher De∣grees of Happiness.

And as the Plan is formed with a View at the End to be answered, they are in effect only the same Thing under diverse Consi∣derations; and a Thing is <HI>True,</HI> considered as intelligible, and <HI>Good</HI> as eligible. Thus a <HI>House</HI> is said to be <HI>True,</HI> as it answers its Archetype or Model, as conceiv'd or understood in the Mind of the Architect; and <HI>Good,</HI> as it is fitted to an∣swer the End he designed in it, <HI>viz.</HI> the Conve∣nience and Pleasure of its Inhabitant, on which it is delightful or eligible. So the <HI>Truth</HI> of each <HI>Creature,</HI> and of the whole <HI>World,</HI> consists in its Conformity to its original Design, Archetype or Standard, conceived in the infinite Mind of the great divine Architect, and as such, intelligible to Him, and in some Measure to any other Mind; and its <HI>Goodness</HI> consists in its Fitness to answer His Ends in giving it Being, and particulary the Happiness of His rational Creatures, on account of which, it is pleasing and eligible to Him, or any other intelligent Being, that feels or discerns that Fitness.

<P N="16">§ 16.

Sense of the Mind? And if it be duly considered, it will be always found that it is Fit∣ness and Proportion, either real or apparent, in relation to some End or Use, in those Objects that please and charm us. Thus in <HI>Beauty;</HI> an Assemblage of various Ideas, all fitted and pro∣portioned to each other, and, in the Whole, to one uniform Design and End, subservient to the Advantage and Pleasure of an intelligent Mind, or of a social System of intelligent Beings; this is what pleases and charms under the Notion of Beauty, as might be exemplified in the Beauty of a Person, an Animal, or a Building, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And from sensible Things it is figuratively and by Ana∣logy transferred to Affections, Actions and Behavi∣our; the Beauty whereof consisteth in their uniform Fitness and Tendency to the Order, Peace and Happiness of each individual Mind, and, in the Whole, of any social System: So as to <HI>Harmo∣ny;</HI> it is an Assemblage of various Sounds, all fitted and proportioned to each other, and in the whole Composition, to an uniform Design and End, expressive of what may please and delight the Mind: And from Music it is transferred to signify Things fitted and proportioned to each other, and to the whole System, and thence pleasing and delightful, whether it be in the na∣tural or moral World. Hence we speak of the Harmony and Order of all Nature, and of the Harmony and Order of Society. So that both in <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Harmony,</HI> the Fitness and Propor∣tion of Things, Affections and Actions to each other, and in the Whole, to the Pleasure, Peace and Happiness of intelligent Beings, is always understood.

This is our original and proper Notion of <HI>Substance</HI> in <HI>Bodies,</HI> and from thence we analogically apply it to

Minds or Spirits, tho' they are Beings of an in∣tirely different Kind, and have nothing common to them but meer <HI>Being</HI> or Existence, so that great Care must be taken that we do not imagine any Thing like a solid <HI>Substratum</HI> in Spirits as such. But if we must apply the Word <HI>Substance</HI> indifferently to both, it may be defined to mean any distinct <HI>Being</HI> considered as consisting of its <HI>essential Properties.</HI> Thus a <HI>Body</HI> we call a <HI>Sub∣stance,</HI> as consisting of <HI>solid Length, Breadth</HI> and <HI>Thickness,</HI> or solid Extension, which are its essen∣tial Properties, without which it cannot be con∣ceived as being what it is: So we call a <HI>Spirit</HI> or <HI>Mind,</HI> a Substance, as being a <HI>Power</HI> or <HI>Princi∣ple</HI> of <HI>conscious Perception</HI> and <HI>Activity,</HI> which are Properties essential to it as being what it is.

usually meant, that Portion of <HI>Duration;</HI> and by its <HI>Place</HI> is meant, that Portion of <HI>Space,</HI> in which it exists. But then by <HI>Space,</HI> we must mean the whole Extent of sensible Things, the <HI>Place</HI> of each par∣ticular Thing, being that Part of the whole Ex∣tent which it occupies, in its proper Situation re∣lative to the rest: And by <HI>Duration,</HI> must be meant, the whole Continuance of the Existence of the entire sensible World, measured out by the Revolutions of the Sun; and the <HI>Time</HI> of any particular sensible Thing, means, its continuing to exist during so many Parts, or such a Number of his Revolutions. But <HI>Time,</HI> considered as a Conception in the Mind, is nothing else but the Succession of its Ideas, of which the Succession of some principal Ones, as the Revolution of <HI>Years, Days,</HI> &amp;c. being settled and stable ac∣cording to the established Course of Nature, are considered as Standards or Measures to the rest. Such are Time and Place, Space and Duration, literally with regard to the sensible World, to which they properly belong, and they are only figuratively, and by Analogy, ascribed to Spirits or intelligent active Beings, concerning which the Term <HI>Ubi, where,</HI> and <HI>when,</HI> by some have been preferred.

from existing in infinite Space and Duration that He comprehendeth all Space and Duration, and every Thing that is, within His boundless Intellect, and is present to all Times and Places, not after the Manner of being co-extended with them, but as an infinitely active, all-comprehending In∣tellect, to whom all Things, all Times and Pla∣ces, are at once present, without Succession or Li∣mitation; <HI>i. e.</HI> they are at once known to His in∣finite Mind, and subjected to, and dependent upon, His unlimited Will and Power.</P>

On the other Hand, we call that a <HI>Part,</HI> which is considered as being not an entire Thing of itself, but as it goes, in Conjunction with other Parts, to the Constitution of a <HI>Whole</HI> or entire Being, as a <HI>Leg</HI> or an <HI>Arm,</HI> with respect to the <HI>Human Bo∣dy:</HI> Such is any individual Thing with respect to the Parts whereof it consists, which therefore may be called an <HI>Individual Whole,</HI> as not being divi∣sible into more of the same Kind, or Quantity, and the Parts of which are not of themselves intire Beings. But besides this, there is, what is called an <HI>aggregate Whole,</HI> the Parts of which, are each a distinct intire Being, tho' it has a Relation to other distinct Beings, with which it is connected as Parts of another Whole; and the Parts are ei∣ther of the <HI>same,</HI> or of <HI>different Kinds:</HI> Such, of the first Sort, is an <HI>Army,</HI> consisting of the many

Now from the <HI>Multiplicity</HI> of Individuals with regard to an aggregate Whole, and of Parts with Regard to each individual Whole, we have the Conception of <HI>Number,</HI> the Parts being numerous or consist∣ing of a Number of Units, as <HI>many Members</HI> in the same Body, <HI>many Men, many Beasts, many Trees,</HI> &amp;c. to which in Computation, we give the Denominations of <HI>One, Two, Three, Four,</HI> &amp;c. And these Parts we consider as subsisting in some <HI>Order,</HI> according to their several Relations and Situations, with regard to each other, and to the Whole: Of which we say, one is <HI>prior,</HI> the other <HI>posterior</HI> to the other, either in <HI>Nature, Time, Place, Dignity</HI> or <HI>Knowledge,</HI> as a <HI>Father</HI> to his <HI>Son,</HI> &amp;c. And this Order of Things which we express by the Terms, <HI>first, second, third, fourth,</HI> &amp;c. we find to be founded in some Establishment which we observe to be made in the Course of Nature, which therefore, in all our Divisions and Sub-divisions, Conceptions and Reasonings, we should make our Standard, and endeavour to follow it as exactly as ever we can.</P>
<P N="21">§ 21. MOREOVER, to this Head of Unity and Multiplicity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Identity and Diver∣sity.</NOTE> belong the Notions of <HI>Identity</HI> and <HI>Diversity.</HI> A Thing is said to be one and the <HI>same,</HI> when it appears to have all the essential indi∣viduating

Properties at one Time that it had at another, tho' it may differ in some Things acci∣dental or circumstantial, as a Man at 5 and at 50: But if Things differ in any Thing essential, we say, they are <HI>Diverse,</HI> being not the same, but the one a different and distinct Being from the other; as an <HI>Apple</HI> and an <HI>Oyster.</HI> But <HI>Iden∣tity</HI> is of very different Consideration in <HI>Bodies</HI> and in <HI>Spirits,</HI> as they are Beings of an entirely different Kind. In <HI>Bodies,</HI> we call that <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same,</HI> which, however it may differ in some Things not essential to it, yet in Things peculiar to it, it affects our Senses in the same Manner at one Time as at another, or consists of the same sensible Qualities, <HI>Figure, Colour,</HI> &amp;c. essential to it; as a <HI>Mountain</HI> now, and twenty Years ago: And those are <HI>diverse</HI> or distinct Bodies one from another, that consist of different sensible Quali∣ties essential to each, as <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>Lead;</HI> or that in Bodies is the same or different, which appears to consist of the same or different individuating sensible Qualities. But as by a <HI>Spirit,</HI> which is also called a <HI>Person,</HI> we mean a distinct, conscious, intelligent Agent, so his Identity consists in being conscious of a Series of Perceptions and Actions that he knows to be his own and not another's, by which therefore he knows he is the same Per∣son now with himself twenty or fifty Years ago, which continued Consciousness is his distinct in∣dividuating Property. Whereas <HI>Peter</HI> is not the same with <HI>Paul,</HI> but another Person, each having distinct individuating Properties, the one being conscious of a different and distinct Series of Per∣ceptions and Actions from the other: And ano∣ther appears to me the same with himself at dif∣ferent Times, or to be a different Person, ac∣cording
<PB N="40" REF="006859_0063_102A8786B9603B80" MS="y"/>
as from his Words and Actions, he ap∣pears to be conscious or not conscious of the same Perceptions and Actions. This is the usual and common Sense of the Word <HI>Person,</HI> which, however, is sometimes used to signify not a di∣stinct Being, but a distinct Capacity: In which Sense the same Intelligence may sustain diverse Persons, by acting in so many different Characters or Capacities. I need say nothing here of the Sense of this Word, as used <HI>in Divinis.</HI></P>

<PB N="41" REF="006859_0064_102A878B4942A6B8"/>
as 2+2=4 and any two <HI>Right Angles</HI> are equal to each other, having the same, or an equal Number of Parts or Degrees. On the contrary, we say Things are <HI>Unequal,</HI> when one is <HI>Greater,</HI> and the other <HI>Less,</HI> as 3 is more than 2, a <HI>Right Angle</HI> is <HI>greater</HI> than an <HI>Acute,</HI> and <HI>less</HI> than an <HI>Obtuse,</HI> &amp;c. And here the Mathematicians have several Maxims which are the Foundations of their Demonstrations; as, <HI>Equals added to Equals, make the Whole equal;</HI> and <HI>Equals taken from E∣quals, leave the Remainder equal:</HI> So of <HI>Unequals,</HI> &amp;c. And from <HI>Bodies</HI> and their Dimensions, this is by Analogy transferred to <HI>Spirits</HI> or Minds, which are compared in their Powers and Facul∣ties, as Bodies, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in their Quantities: Thus we say, one <HI>Man</HI> or <HI>Angel</HI> has an equal, greater or less Degree of Understanding, Force or Acti∣vity, than another, and those of the Deity are infinite, and beyond all Comparison. To this Head belong the Arguments, <HI>a majore ad minus affirmando,</HI> and <HI>a minore ad majus negando;</HI> as, if one Man can lift such a Weight, much more two; and if two cannot lift it, much less one.</P>

is to <HI>Nature,</HI> as the one preserves Order and Harmony in the natural World; so the other preserves Peace and Happiness in the moral World. This is what is called <HI>Analogy</HI> or <HI>Pro∣portion;</HI> and is either <HI>continued</HI> or <HI>disjunct.</HI>—<HI>Con∣tinued</HI> when the <HI>first</HI> Term is to the <HI>second,</HI> as the <HI>second</HI> is to the <HI>third,</HI> as, The <HI>Parent</HI> is to the <HI>Child,</HI> as the <HI>Child</HI> is to the <HI>Grandchild.

Hence that reciprocal Pro∣portion expressing the grand Foundation Principle of Morals, That such Affections and Actions as are right or wrong in another towards me, as tend∣ing to promote my Happiness or Misery in the Whole, must for the same Reason be right or wrong in me towards him, supposing an, Ex∣change of Characters.—Thus of <HI>Similitude.</HI> On the other Hand, we say, Things are <HI>Unlike,</HI> when they have different Qualities and Powers; as <HI>John</HI> is not like <HI>Thomas,</HI> the one being a good Genius, the other a Dunce.</P>

WHATEVER Being or Thing, or what∣ever Power,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Deno∣mination &amp; Definition.</NOTE> Effect, Property, Ad∣junct or Part, Quantity or Quality of any Thing be the Object of our Con∣sideration; in order the better to think of it by ourselves, and especially in order to converse with one another about it, it is ne∣cessary to give it a <HI>Name,</HI> or annex some Sound
<PB N="43" REF="006859_0066_102A879A4D10A678"/>
or other Sign, agreed upon to be steadily signi∣ficative of it, whether it be an Object of the Sense and Imagination, or of the pure Intellect and Reason; and that Sound or Sign so esta∣blished, becomes a Kind of Vehicle to the Idea or Conception, whether Simple, Compound or Complex. Thus we give the Names <HI>White, Black, Red,</HI> &amp;c. to the Colours so called, <HI>Hard, Soft, Hot, Cold,</HI> &amp;c. to the tangible Qualities so called; and <HI>Consciousness, Perception, Self-exertion,</HI> &amp;c. to the simple Conceptions so called.—Thus to instance in the Compounds; we give the Name <HI>Gold</HI> to a certain yellow Metal that is the heavi∣est and most ductile of all others, and the Name <HI>Cherry</HI> to the Fruit of such a Tree, and of such a particular Figure, Consistence and Taste; and so the Name <HI>Justice,</HI> to an Action of an intelligent Agent, designing to render to every one what he apprehends to be his Due, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This is called <HI>Denomination,</HI> or giving Names to Things: And the great Rule to be observed in this Affair, is, That we constantly annex such an Idea or Con∣ception or such a precise Collection or Combina∣tion of either sensible Ideas or intellectual No∣tions, to such a Name or Word, and always use it in the same Sense. And the true Notion of a <HI>Definition,</HI> whether in Things sensible or intellectual, consists in explaining what are the precise Ideas or Conceptions, which are combined and annexed to such a Name. Thus the Word <HI>Gold</HI> means a yellow fusible Body, of the greatest Weight and Ductility of any other, and soluble in <HI>Aqua Regia.</HI> So the Word <HI>Spirit,</HI> means a conscious, intelligent, active, self-exerting Being. Thus we define compound Ideas, or complex Conceptions; but as for those that are simple,
<PB N="44" REF="006859_0067_102A87A34C5E0400"/>
they cannot be defined otherwise than by some synonymous Term, because they can be known only by Experience.</P>
<P N="26">§ 26. ANY one intire Being that cannot be divided into more of the same Kind,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Abstrac∣tion, and of Indivi∣duals, Sorts and Kinds.</NOTE>
we call an <HI>Individual,</HI> whether it be a <HI>Body,</HI> or a <HI>Spirit,</HI> and in order the better to think and speak of it, we give it a proper Name, as, to this <HI>Man</HI> the Name of <HI>John,</HI> to that, <HI>Pe∣ter;</HI> to this <HI>Horse,</HI> the Name <HI>Bucephalus,</HI> to that <HI>Dog,</HI> the Name <HI>Argus,</HI> &amp;c. And if there be no Occasion for a proper Name, we say <HI>this Tree, that Stone,</HI> that <HI>Piece of Gold,</HI> &amp;c. And observing that there are a great Number of <HI>In∣dividuals</HI> that agree in certain essential Properties that discriminate them from all other Things, we call all the Beings of that Sort, a <HI>Species,</HI> and a∣gree upon a common Name that shall indifferent∣ly stand for every Individual of that Sort: This is what is meant by <HI>Abstraction.</HI> Thus observing all the Individuals of <HI>Men</HI> to agree in a certain Figure, Shape and Structure, and in certain Pow∣ers of Reason, Speech and Activity, we call the whole Species by the general Name, <HI>Man,</HI> in which we do, in effect, substitute some indivi∣dual Idea to represent the whole Species, and an∣nex to it a general Name common to all the In∣dividuals. And comparing this Sett of Beings, which we call <HI>Mankind,</HI> with another Sett which we call <HI>Beasts,</HI> we find there are some Proper∣ties in which they all agree, as Life, Sense and spontaneous Motion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> to these we give a more general Name or <HI>Genus,</HI> that shall stand for them all, as the Word <HI>Animal.</HI> And ascending higher, we observe that each Tribe of <HI>Animals</HI>
<PB N="45" REF="006859_0068_102A87A7EF472640"/>
agree with another Sett of Beings called <HI>Plants,</HI> in vegetable Life, and so constitute a yet more general Name to stand for them all, as the Word <HI>Animate.</HI> And finding all these agree still with a vastly greater Number of other Things, <HI>Elements, Stones, Metals,</HI> &amp;c. in the three Dimen∣sions, Length, Breadth and Thickness, we agree on the yet more general Name <HI>Body</HI> to compre∣hend them all. And lastly, <HI>Spirits</HI> are yet ano∣ther Sett of Beings, intirely and <HI>toto Coelo</HI> diffe∣rent from <HI>Bodies</HI> of any Sort, whose Essence con∣sists in conscious Perception and Activity, and have nothing common with them but bare Exi∣stence; so that we comprehend them all, both <HI>Bodies</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> both Things perceiving, and Things perceived, Things active, and Things passive, under the most general Name <HI>Being,</HI> or <HI>Thing; i. e.</HI> what is, or exists. This is the high∣est <HI>Genus</HI> of all, which, with the subordinate <HI>Genera</HI> or Kinds, have been considered as another Kind of <HI>Whole,</HI> called <HI>Totum Genericum</HI> (to di∣stinguish it from the other <HI>Whole,</HI> explained above, § 19. which is properly so called, but for Di∣stinction-sake is also termed <HI>Totum Integrale</HI>) and its Parts are called <HI>Species</HI> (the Parts of the other being called its Members.)—And the <HI>Division</HI> of the <HI>Genus</HI> into its Species may more fitly be cal∣led <HI>Distribution,</HI> and that of the <HI>Integrum</HI> into its <HI>Members, Partition.</HI> Thus in the Instance before us, we distribute <HI>Beings</HI> into <HI>Bodies</HI> and <HI>Spirits; Bodies</HI> into <HI>Inanimate</HI> and <HI>Animate; Animate</HI> into <HI>Plants</HI> and <HI>Animals;</HI> and <HI>Animals</HI> into <HI>Men</HI> and <HI>Beasts.</HI> And lastly, these lowest <HI>Species</HI> can be distributed only into the several <HI>Individuals:</HI> But the <HI>Individuals,</HI> tho' they cannot be <HI>distributed</HI> into <HI>Sorts,</HI> they may be <HI>distinguished</HI> by their

<P N="27">§ 27. IT is of great Importance, in order to think clearly and justly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Particu∣larly of Bo∣dies and Spirits.</NOTE> to take Care that we have as exact a Notion as possible of all those Properties in eve∣ry Kind of Being, that do essentially distinguish one from another, that we may make our <HI>Definitions</HI> and <HI>Divisions</HI> just, and avoid as far as possible, that Perplexity of Thought and Expression which ariseth from con∣founding one Thing with another. But this is more especially necessary in that first great Divi∣sion of <HI>Beings</HI> into <HI>Bodies</HI> and <HI>Spirits;</HI> because we take our first Rise to Knowledge from sensi∣ble Things or Bodies, and by that Means are so prepossessed with a Notion of their Reality and Importance, that it is with much Difficulty that we rise to the Notion of Spirits and what relates to them; or, when we do, to have any strong Apprehension of their Reality and Importance, or to conceive of them but under corporeal Ima∣ges. We should therefore labour much in the Business of Reflexion, and Abstraction from sen∣sible to intellectual Things, and disengage our∣selves from Sense and Imagination as much as possible; and consider, that tho' our Notion of Spirits is intirely of a different Nature and Ori∣ginal, from that of Bodies, it is neither less real and substantial, nor indeed less clear and certain. These we have from Sense and Imagination, and those from Consciousness and Reasoning; but as these are Faculties of as much Reality and Cer∣tainty, as those (nay more) we are not less cer∣tain
<PB N="47" REF="006859_0070_102A87B1A1460930"/>
of the Existence of Spirits than of Bodies, nor have we a less clear Notion of the one than the other. I am as intuitively certain of my own Existence by Consciousness, as of the Existence of Bodies by Sense, and am as demonstratively sure of the Existence of other Spirits, and espe∣cially of the eternal Parent Mind, as I am of any Thing imaginable, whatsoever: Nay (as I said) upon due Consideration, it will appear that the Evidence and Reality here hath much the Advantage. And I do as clearly and perfectly know what I mean, when I say <HI>I</HI> or <HI>myself,</HI> as when I say <HI>my Body;</HI> and have as clear a Notion of the Meaning or Conceptions annexed to the Words, <HI>Sense, Imagination, Consciousness, Under∣standing, Reason, Pleasure, Aversion, Activity, Self-exertion,</HI> &amp;c. as of the Meaning or Ideas annexed to the Words, <HI>Extension, Figure, Soli∣dity, Motion, Colour, Sound, Heat, Cold, Sweet, Bitter,</HI> &amp;c. I as perfectly know the one as the other. So that I must consider <HI>Spirits,</HI> as being as much real and intelligible Beings as <HI>Bodies,</HI> tho' of entirely a different Kind; and indeed as much more real, as they are a more perfect Kind of Be∣ings; as Perception and Action are Things of great∣er Reality and Perfection, than being perceived and acted; Activity than Passivity: And they must be of as much more Importance, as one's <HI>Self</HI> and the Enjoyment of one's Self is of more Im∣portance to us, than any outward sensible Ob∣jects.</P>

those as a Means and Step to these, using sensi∣ble <HI>Signs, Metaphors</HI> and <HI>Analogies,</HI> to represent and shadow forth those more noble, abstract Ob∣jects of Intellect, Reason and Faith: For (to use the Words of the great Author of the <HI>Minute Philosopher,</HI> Dial. VII. § 16.) <Q>As the Mind is better acquainted with some Sort of Objects which are earlier suggested to it, strike it more sensibly, or are more easily comprehended than others, it is naturally led to substitute these Objects for such as are more subtil, fleeting or difficult to conceive. Nothing, I say, is more natural than to make the Things we know, a Step to those we do not know; and to represent and explain Things less familiar, by others that are more so. Now it is certain we imagine before we reflect, and we perceive by Sense before we imagine, and of all our Senses, the Sight is the most clear, distinct, various, agreeable and comprehensive. Hence it is natural to assist the Intellect by Imagina∣tion, the Imagination by Sense, and the other Senses by Sight. Hence Figures, Metaphors and Types. We illustrate spiritual Things by corporeal; we substitute Sounds for Thoughts, and written Letters for Sounds; Emblems, Symbols and Hieroglyphics, for Things too obscure to strike, and too various or too fleet∣ing to be retained: We substitute Things ima∣ginable for Things intelligible; sensible Things for imaginable; smaller Things for those too great to comprehend easily, and greater Things for such as are too small to be discerned di∣stinctly; present Things for absent; perma∣nent for perishing; and visible for invisible. Hence the Use of Diagrams: Hence Right
<PB N="49" REF="006859_0072_102A87C11BEB5AA8"/>
Lines are substituted for Time, Velocity and other Things of very different Natures. Hence we speak of Spirits in a figurative Stile, ex∣pressing the Operations of the Mind by Allu∣sions and Terms borrowed from sensible Things, such as, <HI>apprehend, conceive, reflect, discourse,</HI> and the like. And hence those Al∣legories which illustrate Things intellectual by Visions exhibited to the Fancy.</Q>—Hence also it is that we conceive and speak of God Almigh∣ty by <HI>Analogy</HI> from the greatest Perfections in ourselves, such as <HI>Knowledge, Wisdom, Power, Justice, Goodness,</HI> &amp;c. which we substitute to re∣present his infinite Perfections, removing all Li∣mitation and Imperfection.—And hence it is that in the Revelation which God hath made of him∣self, and his Dispensations towards Mankind, he cloaths himself with human Parts and Passions, in order to render himself in some Measure intelligi∣ble to us, and moreover, teacheth us, what (to all practical Purposes, which are chiefly aimed at) it concerneth us to know of him and his Deal∣ings with us, by Things and Relations familiar among our selves, such as, the Sun, Light and Life, <HI>Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Spirit, Mediator, Redeemer, Priest, Propitiation, King, Kingdom,</HI> &amp;c. All which gracious Accommodations to our low Capacities, we must always so understand and explain as to imply nothing contradictious or unworthy of his infinite Excellency, implied in either his natural or moral Perfections.—Thus much of the Mind's <HI>simple Apprehension</HI> of its Objects, and their Rela∣tions, arising from our comparing them one with another, and the Manner of our conceiving and expressing them.</P>

<P N="1">§ 1. I PROCEED now in the <HI>second</HI> Place to the Consideration of that Act of the Mind, which is called Judgment, <HI>i. e.</HI> which af∣firms or denies one Thing of another,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Judg∣ments and Propositi∣ons.</NOTE> and judges of True and False.—Ac∣cordingly I observe further: That no sooner hath the Mind compared its Ideas or Conceptions one with ano∣ther, but, perceiving, or apprehending that it perceives their Connections and Repugnances, or the Agreement or Disagreement between them, it passeth some Judgment affirming or denying the one of the other, according as it apprehends the one is or is not included or implied in the o∣ther or connected with it. Thus observing the Ideas we call <HI>Roundness</HI> or <HI>Brightness</HI> agree with, or are included in the Idea to which we give the Name <HI>Sun,</HI> we affirm the <HI>Sun</HI> is <HI>Round</HI> or <HI>Bright.</HI>—And finding the Idea we call a <HI>Square</HI> is not comprehended in that of the <HI>Sun,</HI> we deny that <HI>the Sun is Square.</HI>—So with Regard to intel∣lectual Notions; we affirm <HI>Virtue is preferable to Gold,</HI> and deny that <HI>Riches are of so much Worth as Learning;</HI> where <HI>Excellency</HI> beyond that of Gold is included in the Notion of <HI>Virtue,</HI> and an <HI>Ex∣cellency</HI> equal to that of <HI>Learning</HI> is not included in that of <HI>Riches.</HI>—These <HI>Judgments</HI> of the Mind expressed in Words, we call <HI>Propositions:</HI> And the Idea or Conception of which we affirm or de∣ny

<P N="4"><PB N="53" REF="006859_0076_102A87DEF090DC80"/>§ 4. BUT the most important Distinction of Propositions is, into such as are <HI>True</HI> or <HI>False.</HI>—If we join or separate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Pro∣positions True and False.</NOTE> <HI>i. e.</HI> af∣firm or deny Things as being what they really are, the Proposition is <HI>True;</HI> as, <HI>Gold is heavier than Silver,</HI> or <HI>Silver is not so ductile as Gold.</HI>—But if we affirm or deny Things otherwise than they really are, the Pro∣position is <HI>False;</HI> as, <HI>Money is better than Virtue,</HI> or <HI>Learning is not so good as Riches.</HI>—And here it may be remarked, that the proper original Notion of <HI>Truth</HI> (as was above observed, Chap. II. § 15.) is, that it consists in the <HI>Agreement of any Thing with its Standard.</HI>—GOD's infinite Intellect, comprehending all that is, is the original Stand∣ard. He himself is said to be infinite Truth, or the Truth itself, as being infinitely intelligible and perfectly known to his own infinite Intellect, and conformable to it in all that he is and does; and all Things that exist, are what they are originally in his eternal archetypal Idea, or as they are known to him, whether they be Things necessary or contingent.—And the Truth of Things creat∣ed consists in their Conformity to their Arche∣type, as they actually exist in Nature and Fact, partaking of so much Truth and Reality as the great Author of them thought fit to assign them. This is, what is called, <HI>Metaphysical Truth,</HI> as above explained.—And now, this <HI>Existence of Things</HI> as they really are, whether in the eternal Mind, if they are <HI>Things necessary,</HI> or in the Na∣ture and Fact, if they are <HI>Things contingent,</HI> must be the Standard to our Minds, and our <HI>Know∣ledge</HI> or <HI>Judgment</HI> of them is then <HI>Truth,</HI> when we conceive and affirm of them as being what they really are.—This is called <HI>Logical</HI> or <HI>Mental Truth.</HI>
<PB N="54" REF="006859_0077_102A87E6725C5968"/>
—And, lastly, our Thoughts and Judgments of Things must be the Standard to our Words and Expressions concerning them; which are then <HI>Truth,</HI> when they agree with the real Sense and Apprehension of our Minds.—This is called <HI>Verbal Truth;</HI> and when we design nothing but to speak as we think, it is called <HI>Moral Truth.</HI>— Since therefore Truth is inflexible, and Things are what they are whatever we think of them, and no Imagination or Opinion of ours can, in the least, alter them; it concerns us above all Things to think and speak of them, as well as to affect and act with regard to them, exactly as being what they really are.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. AS all Things are in their own Nature either <HI>necessary</HI> or <HI>contingent</HI> (as was shewn above,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Pro∣positions necessary and con∣tingent.</NOTE> Chap. II. § 11.) so are the Propositions expressive of them.— Here therefore it is needful to explain this Distinction of Propositions.—Ac∣cordingly, those <HI>Propositions</HI> we call <HI>ne∣cessary,</HI> which assert Things or Relations which are in their own Nature necessary, immutable and eternal, and which (as was above explained) being founded in the infinite Perfection of the divine Nature, are independent on the divine Will, and therefore cannot be altered by the Power of God himself, because it would involve some Absurdity or Contradiction; as, <HI>Some Be∣ing must have always existed;—no Being can begin to be without a Cause;—Triangles of the same Base and Height are equal;—Benefits deserve Gratitude,</HI> &amp;c.—And those necessary Propositions, whose Evidence is intuitive, are called <HI>Axioms</HI> or <HI>Maxims.</HI> These Truths, with all their necessary Consequen∣ces, are, as it were, so many Rays of that divine

intellectual Light above asserted (Chap. I. § 13. 4. and Chap. II. § 3.) which incessantly flow from the great Fountain of Light, and shine a∣like into all created Minds.—Of this Kind are a Multitude of <HI>metaphysical, mathematical</HI> and <HI>mo∣ral</HI> Truths, which, it is evident, must be of a di∣vine Original, since, like the Deity, they are eve∣ry where present to all Minds, immutable and eternal, and cannot derive from any created Light, or the actual Existence of the Creatures, which is evidently precarious and contingent, tho' they are subservient to lead us up to those Truths that are necessary and eternal.—On the other Hand, those <HI>Propositions</HI> are <HI>contingent,</HI> which assert Things and Relations that are con∣tingent, as depending on the Wills and Powers of free Agents, and consequently might not have been had they so pleased, and the non-existence of them implies no Absurdity, as, <HI>The Sun shines;— John runs.</HI>—And of this Kind are all <HI>physical</HI> Truths which relate to created Natures, and which depend on the free arbitrary Will of the Deity, and Matters of meer Institution; and all <HI>political</HI> and <HI>historical</HI> Truths, which depend on the free Exertion of human Wills.</P>
<P N="6">§ 6.

<PB N="56" REF="006859_0079_102A87F348242AE0"/>
with it.—But if the Connexion between the Subject and Attribute doth not appear at first Sight, the Terms being duly explained, we must make use of a third Idea or Notion called a <HI>Reason</HI> or <HI>Argument,</HI> which may serve as a com∣mon Measure or Standard whereby to judge of the Connexion between them; which, if it evi∣dently appears to agree with each of the Terms of the Proposition, it demonstrates their Agree∣ment between themselves, and if with but one of them, it demonstrates their Disagreement; as, since I know <HI>I began to be, and nothing can begin to be without a Cause,</HI> this demonstratively proves that <HI>I must have had a Cause of my Existence.</HI>— And as <HI>Knowledge</HI> implies a clear Perception of the Agreement or Disagreement between the Subject and Predicate, we are said in both these Cases to have <HI>Knowledge, Certainty</HI> and <HI>Evidence:</HI> In the former, to have <HI>intuitive Certainty,</HI> or <HI>Knowledge by Intuition;</HI> and in the latter to have <HI>demonstrative Certainty,</HI> or <HI>Knowledge by Demon∣stration;</HI> and the Certainty of <HI>Demonstration</HI> is always ultimately resolved into the Certainty of <HI>Intuition.</HI>—And in all Cases, the <HI>Criterion</HI> or Test of Evidence and Certainty, is, that it is not in our Power to with-hold our Assent or Acquies∣cence.—This is called <HI>Science,</HI> which Term is however, by some, restrained to those Truths which are necessary and immutable.</P>
<P N="7">§ 7. On the other Hand, we find it, many Times,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Propo∣sitions doubtful and proba∣ble.</NOTE> in our Power, and even that, in some Cases, we are obliged to with∣hold our Assent for want of perfect Evidence, or a high Probability, there being some good Reasons to <HI>doubt.</HI>— Now if the Reasons against the Truth
<PB N="57" REF="006859_0080_102A87F9310D3C58"/>
of any Proposition rather preponderate when du∣ly compared with the Reasons for it, it is called <HI>doubtful.</HI>—On the contrary, if the Reasons for it manifestly appear to prevail over those against it, it is said to be <HI>probable:</HI> Thus we say, it is <HI>doubtful, whether the Comets are inhabited,</HI> because they seem to be in an irregular chaotic State: But it is <HI>probable</HI> that <HI>the Planets are inhabited,</HI> be∣cause they appear to be vast Globes in a settled re∣gular Condition, analogous to our Earth, and no other good End can be assigned them. Yet it is only <HI>probable,</HI> because we do not know enough of them to be perfectly sure that no other good End can be answered by them, and it is possible to be otherwise.—And of these Doubts and Pro∣babilities there are endlessly various Degrees, ac∣cording to the various Numbers and Weight of the Reasons for or against them; and they also variously appear more or less probable or doubtful to different Persons, according as they have more or less Capacity or Opportunity to examine them, and according as they give their Attention more or less to the Consideration of them. And when any Proposition is supported with all the Reasons it is, in the Nature of it, capable of, and there remains no sufficient Reason to doubt of the Truth of it, we are then said to have a <HI>moral Cer∣tainty,</HI> and our Assent to it is called a <HI>Persuasion,</HI> which implies a settled Acquiescence of the Mind in the Truth of it.</P>
<P N="8">§ 8.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Opi∣nion and Faith, and Rules of Assent.</NOTE> If the Reasons for the Proba∣bility or moral Certainty of any Propo∣sition are taken from the Nature of the Things considered in themselves, our Assent to it is called <HI>Opinion;</HI> as when I say, <HI>I am of Opinion that the Pla∣nets

are inhabited,</HI> from the Reasons that are ta∣ken from the Nature of them, so far as we can come to the Knowledge of it; which Term also is, by some, used to signify our Assent to all con∣tingent Propositions, however so certain.—But if the Reasons of our Assent are taken only or chief∣ly from the Testimony of others (as suppose we were told by credible Persons that came from the Planets, that they are inhabited) it is called <HI>Faith,</HI> which will be stronger or weaker accord∣ing to the Credibility of the Thing in itself, and the Number and Credibility of the Persons at∣testing it;—who, if they be Men, one or more, it is called <HI>Human Faith;</HI> such as that whereby I believe there is such a Place as <HI>Constantinople,</HI> and that there were such Men as <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Julius Caesar,</HI> &amp;c. And when any Fact of our Times is asserted by the concurrent Testimony of all Men, or any ancient Fact is attested by the uni∣versal Suffrage of all Antiquity, uninterruptedly handed down to us from Age to Age, we have the highest <HI>moral Certainty,</HI> which scarce leaves Room for possible Doubt.—But if any Proposi∣tion be attested by God himself, our Assent, or Acquiescence in the Truth of it, is called <HI>divine Faith,</HI> such as that whereby I believe there will be a <HI>Resurrection,</HI> and a <HI>future Judgment,</HI> &amp;c.— And this Faith must intirely exclude all Doubt, if we are morally sure that the Proposition comes from God, and that we rightly understand it, be∣cause we are demonstratively certain, that he can neither deceive nor be deceived, so that <HI>Faith</HI> is at the Bottom grounded upon <HI>Reason.</HI>—And in all Cases, if the Subject be not capable of clear Evi∣dence, we must be content with such Proof as the Nature of it will admit of; having also a due

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV. Of the Mind</HI> reasoning and methodizing its Thoughts.—</HEAD>
<P N="1">§ 1. NOW, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> that Act of the Mind which seeks Reasons or Arguments to prove the Truth or Falshood of any Proposition,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Reason in general.</NOTE> and makes use of them to that Purpose is called Reason.—In order to the right Exercise of which, it is neces∣sary,—<HI>First,</HI> That we carefully consider the Words of the <HI>Proposition</HI> to be proved or inquir∣ed into, which is now called the <HI>Question,</HI> and all the Words and Terms we make use of in our Argumentations upon it; and mark well what Ideas or Conceptions we annex to them, and al∣ways use the same Word in the same Sense, that we may industriously avoid all Ambiguity.— And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> That we consider exactly the Ideas or Notions themselves signified by them, as much as possible, divested of the Words, and re∣count and consider the Parts and Properties whereof they consist, that we may see how far our intuitive Knowledge goes, <HI>i. e.</HI> what Attri∣butes do, at first Sight, appear to be included in the Subject, or related to it, and what kind of Relation they bear; that, by this Means, care∣fully sifting and canvassing the Matter, and sepa∣rating
<PB N="60" REF="006859_0083_102A88199BED0088"/>
what is clear from what is doubtful, we may first be sure where the Doubt lies, and wherein the Merits of the Cause do really consist.</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. THESE Things being first duly observed, the right Exercise of Reason proper∣ly consists,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the right Ex∣ercise of Reason.</NOTE>—<HI>First,</HI> In taking a care∣ful Survey of all the Relations which the Subject or Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>icate of the Que∣stion, or disputed Proposition, bear to any other Ideas or Notions, and thereby searching out and discovering some third Idea or Concepti∣on related to one or other, or both of them, which is called the Reason or Argument, and, as I said, may be considered as a common Measure by which to judge of the Relation between them; the Foundation of which is that grand Maxim above mentioned (Chap. II. § 22.) That <HI>those Things which agree or differ in a Third, must agree or dif∣fer between themselves;</HI> this is called <HI>Sagacity.</HI>— To which Purpose it is necessary that we endea∣vour to consider the Whole of Things, and as far as we can, make ourselves Masters of our Sub∣ject; and in many Cases it may be of good Use to have Recourse to the several Topicks above ex∣plained in the second Chapter, Causes, Effects, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—And as all our Reasoning takes its Rise from self-evident Propositions, we must see to it, that the Connexion between them and those we would prove, be made as clear and evident as possible before we proceed to a Conclusion. And, <HI>Secondly,</HI> When we have found an Argument, and duly considered its Relation to the Terms of the Question, the Act of Reason consists in inferring, from the Agreement or Disagreement of the Sub∣ject and Attribute of the Question with this inter∣mediate Idea or Conception, their Agreement or
<PB N="61" REF="006859_0084_102A881BD821B048"/>
Repugnancy between themselves: This is called <HI>Illation.</HI>—Thus, suppose the Question were, <HI>Whether Virtue be more valuable than Riches?</HI>—I first consider the Nature of <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Riches</HI> in all their Properties and Relations; I compare them with each other, and particularly with regard to our <HI>Happiness,</HI> which alone can render any Thing more or less valuable to us; and then, from that general self-evident Proposition, That, <HI>what most contributes to our Happiness is most valuable,</HI> I in∣fer, That, <HI>since Virtue conduceth vastly more to our Happiness than Riches,</HI> it must upon that Ac∣count, <HI>be vastly more valuable.</HI></P>
<P N="3">§ 3. THE Method of Reasoning in the Schools is called <HI>Syllogism,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Nature of Syllogism.</NOTE> which consists in comparing the intermediate Idea or Ar∣gument, <HI>First,</HI> With the <HI>Predicate</HI> of the Question, which is called the <HI>Ma∣jor Term,</HI> as being generally the most extensive; for which Reason the first Proposition is called the <HI>Major; Secondly,</HI> With the Subject of it, which is called the <HI>Minor Term,</HI> and therefore this se∣cond Proposition is called the <HI>Minor,</HI> and these two are called the Premises: And then, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> In making the Conclusion according as it is found to agree or disagree with both, or either of them. If it is found to agree with both, it is affirmative; if with but one, it is negative.—As, suppose the Question were, <HI>Whether Justice ought always to be practised?</HI>—The Argument shall be the <HI>Advan∣tageousness</HI> of it.—Then the <HI>Major</HI> Proposition will be, <HI>What is advantageous in the whole is al∣ways to be practised:</HI> The <HI>Minor,</HI> That <HI>Justice is ever advantageous in the whole:</HI>—Then the <HI>Conclusion</HI> will be, That <HI>Justice is always to be practised.</HI>—Or, <HI>what is mischievous to Society ought not to be practised; Lying is mischievous to So∣ciety;</HI>
<PB N="62" REF="006859_0085_102A88240C815EC8"/>
—therefore <HI>Lying ought not to be practised.</HI> —The Ground of which Method of Reasoning is this Maxim: That <HI>whatever can truly be uni∣versally affirmed or denied of any Subject, may truly be affirmed or denied of all or any of the Particu∣lars or Individuals comprehended under that Sub∣ject.</HI>—And if either of the Premises be yet doubt∣ful, being denied, it must be proved after the same Manner as before, till we arrive at two Premises, neither of which can reasonably admit of any Doubt.</P>
<P N="4">§ 4. SYLLOGISMS of this Kind are called the <HI>Categorick</HI> Forms, as being expressed absolutely,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the three Fi∣gures of Categorick Syllogisms.</NOTE> and always consist of only simple Propositions.—In which the most usual and useful are those, where∣in the intermediate Idea or Argument precedes, as being the Subject in the Major Proposition, which is always universal, and follows, being the Predicate in the Minor, which is always affirmative: and this is called the <HI>first Figure:</HI> As, <HI>An infinitely wise and good Being cannot delight in the Misery of his Creatures:— God is an infinitely wise and good Being;</HI>—there∣fore, <HI>God cannot delight in the Misery of his Crea∣tures.</HI> But in some Cases it may be most conve∣nient to make the middle Term the Predicate of both the Premises, one of which is always nega∣tive, and the Major universal; this is called the <HI>second Figure,</HI> as <HI>All Virtue is amiable; Avarice is not amiable;</HI> therefore, <HI>Avarice is not a Virtue.</HI> And lastly, sometimes it may be most conveni∣ent to make the middle Term the Subject of both the Premises; which is called the third Figure; in which the Minor must be affirmative, and the Conclusion is always particular; as, Solomon <HI>did
<PB N="63" REF="006859_0086_102A88259D0C66C0"/>
not always act wisely:</HI> But Solomon <HI>was a wise Man;</HI> therefore, <HI>some wise Man doth not always act wisely,</HI> or, which is the same, <HI>All wise Men do not always act wisely.</HI> Much is here said by Logici∣ans of the <HI>Modes</HI> of Syllogisms under each of these Figures, which is rather Matter of Curiosity than Use; but if any one desires to gratify his Curiosity, he may see a most complete and ac∣curate Account of them in the <HI>Port-Royal Art of Thinking.</HI></P>
<P N="5">§ 5. BUT the same Arguments may be dis∣posed more familiarly in what is called the <HI>Hypothetick Form,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Hypothe∣tick Syllo∣gism.</NOTE> the <HI>Major</HI> of which is a conditional Proposition, as in the former Example: <HI>If virtue is, in the whole, more conducive to our Hap∣piness than Riches, it is more valuable: But it is in the whole more conducive to our Happiness: Therefore it is more valuable.</HI> So in a later In∣stance: <HI>If Lying be mischievous to Society, it ought not to be practised: But it is mischievous,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>therefore ought not to be practised.</HI> Here the ma∣jor Proposition consists of two Parts, which are called the Antecedent and the Consequent, and the Argument proceeds from the affirming or Position of the Antecedent to the Position of the Consequent. But there is another Form of it which proceeds from taking away of the Conse∣quent to taking away of the Antecedent, as, <HI>If I had said such a Thing, I should have thought of it; But I never thought of it, therefore I never said it.</HI></P>
<P N="6">§ 6.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Disjunc∣tive Syl∣logism.</NOTE> THERE is likewise another Form of Syllogism which is called the <HI>Disjunctive Form,</HI> in which the Parts must be Opposites, so that the Position of the first must infer the taking away of
<PB N="64" REF="006859_0087_102A882A0810E160"/>
the other, or of all the rest, if there be more than two; or the taking away of the latter, or all the rest, if more than two, must infer the Po∣sition of the former; as, <HI>Every Man serves ei∣ther God or Mammon:</HI> Peter <HI>serves God, there∣fore he cannot serve Mammon:</HI> or, Judas <HI>serves Mammon, therefore cannot be a Servant of God.</HI> And to give an Instance where there are more than two, <HI>Every Action is either good, bad or indiffe∣rent; but to relieve a poor Man is a good Action;</HI> therefore it is <HI>neither bad nor indifferent;</HI> or, it is <HI>neither bad nor indifferent;</HI> therefore <HI>it is a good Action.</HI></P>
<P N="7">§ 7. These are the chief Forms of Reasoning to which all others, that are of any Consequence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of irregu∣lar Syllo∣gisms.</NOTE> may be reduced. It may not however be amiss to say something of those which are called <HI>irregular Syl∣logisms.</HI> Of which, some are <HI>redundant,</HI> as con∣sisting of more than three Propositions, of which Number only regular Syllogisms consist: In which Case, a Reason is added to support either the Major or Minor, or both, before we proceed to the Conclusion. Others are <HI>deficient,</HI> as when the <HI>Major</HI> is left out or suppressed in the Mind, be∣ing understood, tho' not expressed; as, <HI>Virtue conduces more to our Happiness than Riches, there∣fore it is more excellent;</HI> such are called <HI>Enthymems.</HI> But the most noted of these irregular Syllogisms are the <HI>Dilemma</HI> and the <HI>Sorites.</HI> In a <HI>Dilemma,</HI> the major Proposition is a Conditional, whose Con∣sequent contains all the several Suppositions upon which the Antecedent can take Place, which be∣ing removed in the Minor, it is apparent the An∣tecedent must also be taken away; as, <HI>If God did not create the World, it must either have been
<PB N="65" REF="006859_0088_102A882F54964380"/>
self-existent, or have derived from meer Chance; but it could neither be self-existent nor derive from Chance; therefore it must have been created by God. Sorites</HI> is a Method of arguing in a Series of Proposi∣tions, so connected together, that the Predicate of the first becomes the Subject of the second, and so on, till we come to a Conclusion, in which the Predicate of the last Proposition appears from those intermediate Propositions to be connected with the Subject of the first. For an Example of the <HI>Sorites,</HI> we may set down the following Way of Reasoning, to prove the natural Immor∣tality of the Soul.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Soul is a conscious, intelligent, active, self-exerting Being.</P>
<P N="2">2. A conscious, intelligent, active, self-exert∣ing Being, as such, is intirely of an opposite and different Nature and Kind from that of Bodies, and therefore can have nothing common with them but bare Existence.</P>
<P N="3">3. A Being that, as such, is intirely of a different Nature from Bodies, and hath nothing besides Existence common with them, can have no corporeal Properties and Affections, such as solid Extension, Continuity of Parts, and Divisi∣bility or Discerpibility.</P>
<P N="4">4. A Being that, having no corporeal Pro∣perties, and so does not consist of solid extended Parts, divisible or discerpible, cannot be naturally liable to a Dissolution.</P>
<P N="5">5. What is not, in the Nature of it, liable to a Dissolution, must be naturally immortal. <HI>Ergo,</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. The Soul is naturally immortal. And here these intermediate Propositions may be re∣duced to so many categorick Syllogisms, begin∣ning with the last, and ending with the first.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="66" REF="006859_0089_102A88318D22DE88"/>§ 8. THOUGH the Rules given above, if du∣ly attended to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of So∣phisms.</NOTE> would effectually pre∣vent all sophistical Reasoning; yet it may not be amiss to add a few Words concerning what are called <HI>Sophisms</HI> or false Rea∣sonings; among which, the chief are, 1. That which is called <HI>Ignoratio Elenchi,</HI> which is, when the Dispute proceeds upon a Mistake, occasioned by not attending to the true Meaning or State of the Question. 2. <HI>Petitio principii,</HI> which is, when in pretending to argue, the Thing is ta∣ken for granted which was to be proved; this we call Begging the Question. 3. <HI>Fallacia qua∣tuor terminorum,</HI> which is, when the intermediate Term bears a different Sense in the Minor, from the Sense in which it was used in the Major. 4. <HI>Non Causa pro Causa,</HI> which is, when that is, by Mistake, taken for a Cause, which was not the Cause; as, when a Person receives his Health consequent to the using such a Medicine, and a∣scribes it to that, when perhaps it might really be owing to a Medicine which he had used before. And 5thly, the last I shall mention, is that which ariseth from what is called the <HI>Association of Ideas,</HI> where because such Ideas are connected meerly by Custom, we are apt to conceit they are connected in Nature, as Terrors with Dark∣ness. On which Account it is of great Import∣ance in Education, to take Care that no Ideas be∣come associated by Habit or Custom but those that are connected in Nature; and on the other Hand, that those Ideas that are really connected in Nature be associated by Habit or Custom, that a Sense of their Connection may operate with the greater Force in the Conduct of Life. And thus much for <HI>Syllogism.</HI></P>
<P N="9"><PB N="67" REF="006859_0090_102A88349378B9D8"/>§ 9. THE last Thing in Logick, is that Course of Reasoning which is called <HI>Method,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Me∣thod.</NOTE> which is only a regular Pro∣ceeding in connecting a large Series of Reasonings or Instructions on any Subject, and therefore truly belongs to this Part of Logick which treats of Reasoning. For in delineating a whole Science, or treating on any large Subject, it is necessary to pursue it thro' a long Chain of Reasoning, or a whole Series of Propositions mu∣tually related; in which it is of great Import∣ance, both for the clearer understanding it, and the better remembering it, that we carefully ob∣serve the Order that Nature itself points out to us; so as to begin with what is plain and simple, and thence to proceed gradually to what is more compounded and obscure; so ordering and rang∣ing Things through the whole Process, that what goes before may continually reflect Light upon what is to follow, and pave the Way to it; and taking the utmost Care to preserve Evidence, or at least the highest possible Degree of Probability in every Step, till we arrive at the highest Truth and Good, or the Conclusion we aim at.—In order to which, the best Thing we can do, is to observe diligently the Manner in which the best Writers proceed, in treating on any Subject they propose to handle, and particularly, the Mathe∣maticians, and Moralists.—Now, I say, such a Series of Reasonings we call <HI>Method;</HI> which, if it begin with Effects, and ariseth to the Discove∣ry of Causes, or with particular Facts, Parts or Properties, and ariseth gradually to the Whole, and to general Principles, and Conclusions, it is called the <HI>Analytical Method.</HI>—But if it begin with Causes already discovered, and descend to
<PB N="68" REF="006859_0091_102A883629491398"/>
Effects, or with general Principles, and descend, by the Application of them, to the Illustration or Proof of Particulars or Facts, it is called the <HI>Synthetical Method.</HI>—The first is used in searching and discovering Truth; the second chiefly in teaching it in the most compendious Manner, when it is discovered.</P>
<P N="10">§ 10. BUT in order to succeed well in the right Use of our Reason,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the dis∣interested Love of Truth.</NOTE> be the Form or Method what it will, whether in Thinking or Reasoning by ourselves, or in a joint Searching after Truth, in our Conversation with others, which should be our only View in what is called Dis∣putation, it is of the greatest Importance that we observe some such Rules as these; 1. That we habitually consider the Knowledge of <HI>Truth,</HI> as being the highest Perfection and Happiness of our Minds, which therefore should be our grand Pursuit, separate from every other Consideration. 2. That accordingly we possess ourselves of an ardent and disinterested Love of Truth, for its own intrinsic Excellency; and of the utmost Aversion to all Falshood and Deceit, or being any ways misled or imposed upon by false Co∣lours, and delusive Appearances. 3. That in order to this, we honestly endeavour as much as possible to divest ourselves of all sinister Views and Prejudices, in favour of any vulgar Opini∣ons, pre-conceived Schemes, or worldly Interests, and guard ourselves against every untoward Ap∣petite or Passion, that may darken or byass our Minds, and so keep them as calm as possible, and open and ready to the Impressions of the naked Truth. 4. In order the better to come at Truth, we must endeavour to consider, with the utmost
<PB N="69" REF="006859_0092_102A883866C01EC8"/>
Attention, the Things themselves, with all their various Relations and Connections, divested of the Delusions and Ambiguities of Words, which are many times apt to mislead us. 5. And lastly, we must enlarge our Views as much as possible, so as to take the Whole of Things into our Conside∣ration, without which we cannot make any tolera∣ble Judgment of what relates to Particulars. If we would faithfully observe these and the like Rules for the Conduct of our Understandings, and at the same time, be, above all Things, concerned to do our Duty, and to know the Truth, with this honest View, to be governed by it in Heart and Life, with all Humility, and <HI>without Par∣tiality or Hypocrisy,</HI> we should not be in Danger of being misled into any great or dangerous Mistakes, but should attain to know the Truth, <HI>and the Truth would make us free.</HI>—And thus much for the several Objects and Operations of the Understanding, which are the Subject of <HI>Logicks.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V. Of the Mind</HI> affecting, willing <HI>and</HI> acting.</HEAD>
<P N="1">§ 1. HAVING thus given some Account of the Subject of <HI>Logicks,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Passions in general.</NOTE>
which relate to the Conduct of the In∣tellect, in its various Exertions, I now go on to give a short Sketch of the Subject of <HI>Ethics,</HI> which relate to the Conduct of our Affections and Behaviour; of which no more is here intended, than what is just necessary, in order to the Business of the next Chapter.—Here there∣fore,
<PB N="70" REF="006859_0093_102A8839FAA11C08"/>
according to what was observed above (Chap. I. § 12.) we are to treat, 1. Of our <HI>af∣fecting</HI> or <HI>disaffecting</HI> Things, according as they appear good or bad. 2. Of our <HI>chusing</HI> or <HI>re∣fusing,</HI> willing, or nilling them, according as we affect or disaffect them. And, 3. Of our freely <HI>acting,</HI> or <HI>forbearing</HI> to act, according to the Judg∣ment and Choice we have made. <HI>First</HI> then, we are to consider the <HI>Affections</HI> or <HI>Passions,</HI> of which we are conscious, and which next occur to be ob∣served in the Frame of our rational Nature, the Doctrine or Explication of which is called <HI>Pa∣thology;</HI> for no sooner doth any Object come under the Mind's Consideration, but it appears agreeable or disagreeable, according as it is, by the established Law of our Nature, attended with Pleasure or Pain, or, at least, with some Degree of Satisfaction or Uneasiness, or the Apprehen∣sion of it.—Now, by the <HI>Passions,</HI> we mean in general, such Affections or Disaffections, Inclina∣tions or Aversions, as we experience in ourselves, upon feeling or expecting that Pleasure or Unea∣siness with which any Object is attended.—And such is the Law of Union between our Souls and Bodies, that upon our being affected or disaffect∣ed towards any-Object, we are sensible of cer∣tain Commotions and Perturbations in our Blood and Spirits, corresponding and in Proportion to those pleasing or displeasing Apprehensions.</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. NOW the leading Passion, and which seems in some Degree to be at the Bottom in all our Passions,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Pas∣sions more particular∣ly.</NOTE> is what we call <HI>Admiration</HI> or <HI>Wonder,</HI> which, in a high Degree, is called <HI>Astonish∣ment,</HI> and is that Sentiment which we feel on the Perception of any Thing that is new,
<PB N="71" REF="006859_0094_102A883CC0340C38"/>
or great, or what we are unaccustomed to, or from which we have strong Apprehensions of Pleasure or Uneasiness.—And more particularly, when we are delighted in any Thing, as being at∣tended with Pleasure, we are said to <HI>love</HI> it; and if we actually possess the Pleasure, it is attended with <HI>Joy.</HI>—If the Object of our Affection be a Person, our Love may be called <HI>Esteem;</HI> and if the Person be in Misery, it is called <HI>Pity</HI> or <HI>Com∣passion:</HI> And if the Object be absent or future, it hath the Name of <HI>Desire</HI> or <HI>Hope.</HI>—On the other Hand, when we are disaffected towards any Object, apprehending it to be attended with Pain or Uneasiness, we are said to <HI>hate</HI> it; and the ac∣tual Sufferance of that Pain or Uneasiness is cal∣led <HI>Grief;</HI> and <HI>Shame,</HI> if it arise from the Con∣sciousness of our own Misconduct; and if the Object be a mean and despicable Character, the Passion is called <HI>Contempt;</HI> and if the Evil be future and impending, it is Terror, or <HI>Fear.</HI>— If the Object from which we feel or apprehend Pleasure, be procured, or occur to us by Means of any Person or free Agent, designing Good to us, we call our Sentiment on that Occasion, <HI>Be∣nevolence, Complacence</HI> and <HI>Gratitude,</HI> attended with a Desire to reward it; and with Joy at any Good, or Grief at any Ill that occurs to our Friend or Benefactor: And this Temper, if it arise to a settled Habit of mutual Good-will and good Offices, we call <HI>Friendship.</HI> But, on the other Hand, if the Object from whence we feel or apprehend Pain or Uneasiness be procured or occur to us by Means of any free Agent, de∣signing any Evil or Mischief to us, we call our Sentiment on that Occasion, <HI>Malevolence, Anger,</HI> or <HI>Resentment,</HI> which is apt to be attended with a
<PB N="72" REF="006859_0095_102AABA9D3DF3FF0"/>
Desire to revenge it; and with Joy at any Evil that befals our Enemy, or Grief at any Good that may occur to him, which is called <HI>Envy.</HI> And if this Temper groweth to a settled Habit of Ill-will towards the supposed injurious Person, it acquireth the Name of <HI>Malice.</HI></P>
<P N="3">§ 3. THESE <HI>Passions</HI> are natural to us, and, as such,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the End and Use of them.</NOTE> must be considered as Part of the Frame of our Natures, and consequently as being implanted in us by the Author of our Nature, for answering very wise and good Ends, relating to our Happiness; and therefore are so far from being evil in themselves, that they have the Na∣ture of Good, as well as all our other Faculties, and so, like the rest, become morally Good or Evil, according to the good or ill Use we make of them. Now as God hath so framed us, that our Happiness should depend on a vigorous Ac∣tivity in the Use of the Powers and Faculties he hath given us, his Design in planting these Pas∣sions in us, was, that they might be, as it were, Spurs and Incentives in us, to put us upon such a vigorous Activity, in avoiding those Things that are mischievous either to ourselves or others, and pursuing those Things in which our Happi∣ness or that of others consists. For the Passions are, as it were, the Wings of the Soul, by which it is carried on with Vehemence and Impetuosity in its several Pursuits; and, as it were, its Springs, by which it is animated and invigorated in all its Exertions. Thus <HI>Love, Desire</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> vigo∣rously animate and spur us on to the Pursuit of those Things that we love, desire and hope for, as being connected with our Well-being and Happiness; and <HI>Hatred, Abhorrence</HI> and <HI>Fear,</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="006859_0096_102AABAB9E221C80"/>
engage us with the utmost Vehemence to fly from, and guard against, those Things that we abhor and dread, as tending to our Misery. And as <HI>Benevolence, Compassion</HI> and <HI>Gratitude,</HI> in∣spire us with a Delight in all those good Offices in which both our personal and social Happiness consists; so <HI>Malevolence, Aversion</HI> and <HI>Anger,</HI> are useful to inspire us with Indignation and Zeal, in opposing all those impious and injurious Practices that tend to the Mischief and Misery of Society in general, as well as each particular Person.</P>
<P N="4">§ 4. SO that the <HI>Passions</HI> are designed to be, and are, in their Nature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the due Govern∣ment of them.</NOTE> capable of being subservient to a Multitude of excellent Purposes; and all that is ne∣cessary to render them so, is, that there be a right Judgment made, what Objects we ought to affect or disaffect, as being really connected with our Happiness or Misery, either personal or social; and that they be duly ballanced one with another, and rightly governed and moderated in Proportion to the real Value and Importance of their respective Objects. And for this Purpose were we furnished with the Pow∣ers of <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Conscience,</HI> that they might preside oyer our Passions, and make a right Judgment of their several Objects, and thence prescribe Laws to them, and restrain them from all Exorbitancies and Irregularities; that we might know what we ought to <HI>love</HI> or <HI>hate,</HI> to <HI>hope</HI> for or <HI>fear,</HI> to be <HI>pleased</HI> or <HI>displeased</HI> with, and in what Proportion, and not to suffer them to ex∣ceed the real Value and Importance of Things with regard to our true Happiness. Since, there∣fore, the great Author of our Nature aims at our Happiness, and hath given us our Passions
<PB N="74" REF="006859_0097_102AABAD2A2FF510"/>
to be subservient to it, and furnished us with Reason, to govern and regulate them in such a Manner as to render them useful to that End, it must be his Will and Law, and the Law of our Nature, that we should duly exercise our Reason in the right Government of them, so as not to suffer them to hurry us on into such Actions as our Reason and Conscience disallow, as being contrary to the eternal Laws of Justice and Be∣nevolence: And one of the chief Concerns in Culture and Education is, to discipline and mo∣derate the Passions, and to inure them to a ready Submission to the Dictates of Reason and Con∣science.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. AND <HI>lastly,</HI> in consequence of any Ob∣ject's appearing agreeable or disagree∣able to our Minds,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Will, Activity and Liber∣ty.</NOTE> as tending to our Pleasure or Uneasiness, and being ac∣cordingly affected or disaffected, the last Things I mentioned, of which we are conscious in ourselves, and which I shall here briefly take together, are the Powers of <HI>chusing</HI> the one, and <HI>refusing</HI> the other, and our <HI>Wills</HI> to act, or not to act, with a Power of <HI>free Activity,</HI> whereby we are able spontaneously to ex∣ert ourselves for obtaining the one, and avoiding the other. Now, as our true Happiness consists in being secure from all Pain or Uneasiness, which is called <HI>natural Evil,</HI> and in being possessed of such Pleasures and Satisfactions as are suitable to our Nature in the Whole of it, which are called <HI>na∣tural Good;</HI> so our highest <HI>natural Perfection</HI> con∣sists in being capable of rightly judging and chu∣sing for ourselves, and of a free and vigorous Activity, conformable to our best Judgment and Choice, for avoiding the one, and attaining the
<PB N="75" REF="006859_0098_102AABB057C56B30"/>
other. And as our <HI>Reason</HI> was plainly given us, to enable us to make a right Judgment what we ought to chuse and avoid, and to do and forbear, in order to our true Happiness, in the Whole of our Nature and Duration; and our <HI>Will</HI> consists in freely resolving and determining ourselves to the one or the other, as they shall appear to our Judgment; so our highest <HI>moral Perfection</HI> con∣sists in actually making a right Judgment, what we ought to affect or disaffect, and to do and forbear; and in <HI>freely</HI> and habitually exerting our∣selves in chusing and doing the one, and rejecting and forbearing the other, conformable thereunto. I say <HI>freely;</HI> for Freedom or <HI>Liberty</HI> consisteth in having a Power to act, or not to act, as we please, and consequently to suspend judging or acting, till we have taken Opportunity to make as deli∣berate and exact a Judgment as ever we can, what is best for us in the Whole, to do or for∣bear; as <HI>Necessity,</HI> on the other Hand, consider∣ed as opposed to Liberty, implieth, that it is out of our Power to suspend acting, or to do other∣wise than we do, in which Case there can be nei∣ther Praise nor Blame.</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. I SAY our highest <HI>moral Perfection</HI> con∣sists in freely doing what we know tends to make us intirely happy in the Whole of our Nature and Duration:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the right go∣verning our Activity &amp; our highest moral Per∣fection.</NOTE> But then it must be considered, that, as GOD is our chief Good, our great Creator, Preserver and Governor, on whom we do intirely depend for our Being, and for all our Happiness, and all our Hopes; and as he wills our Happiness, as his End in giving and continuing our Beings, and consequently every Thing as a Means, that
<PB N="76" REF="006859_0099_102AABB212A4E360"/>
is conducive to it; so it must be supposed to be implied in our highest moral Perfection, that we be intirely devoted to Him, and do every Thing conducive to our Happiness, in Relation to <HI>Him, ourselves,</HI> and <HI>one another,</HI> in a designed Con∣formity to Him as our great Original and Pat∣tern, and in Compliance with his Will, and from a Sense of Duty to Him as our supreme moral Governor. And consequently, that, as by Rea∣son of our great Ignorance and Weakness, we stand in much Need of his Instruction and As∣sistance, in order to judge what is truly condu∣cive to our Happiness, and to put it in Practice; it must imply a most grateful and ready Sub∣mission to his Instructions and Injunctions, and Dependance upon his Aids and Assistances to ren∣der all our Endeavours successful, in the Pursuit of our true and everlasting Happiness. But the more particular Prosecution of these Subjects will be the Business of <HI>Ethics</HI> or <HI>Moral Philoso∣phy,</HI> especially as it is improved by <HI>Christianity.</HI></P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. VI. Of the</HI> Progress of the Mind, from its first Notices, towards its utmost Perfection.</HEAD>
<P N="1">§ 1. MEAN time, I would, in Pursu∣ance of my first Design, make a few Observations,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Mind's Progress, from its first No∣tices.</NOTE> agreeable to the Sketch here laid down, on the gradual Pro∣gress of the human Mind, from the first Notices of <HI>Sense</HI> and <HI>Intellect,</HI> to its highest Perfection and Happiness. And as to its first Notices, they are doubtless those of <HI>Sense,</HI> but directly
<PB N="77" REF="006859_0100_102AABB46B5790D8"/>
joined with a <HI>Consciousness</HI> of its Perceptions.— Warmth and Hunger, and probably some Pains, are, perhaps, all the Sensations it hath before its Birth; and when it comes into the Light of this World, it is directly impressed with the Sense of Light and Colours, as well as Sounds, Tastes, Odours, and frequent uneasy and painful Sensa∣tions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> all which still more and more awaken its Consciousness; and every fresh Notice of Sense and Consciousness, still goes on to excite its Ad∣miration, and engage its Attention. And being a perfect Stranger to every Thing about it, it hath every Thing to learn; to which it diligently applies itself, as its Consciousness more and more awakens, upon the Repetition, every Moment, of fresh Impressions of Sense; till, by Degrees, having a great Number of Feelings, Tastes, Odours, Sounds, and visible Objects, frequently repeating their several Impressions, its conscious Memory still enlarging, it begins, by Means of the intellectual Light, with which it finds its Consciousness attended, gradually to collect and recollect the several Relations and Connections it observes to obtain among its various Ideas: And at length, when it is in Ease, it discovereth a won∣derful Curiosity and Delight in observing these Connections, as well as being impressed with new Ideas.</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. IT hath been made very evident both by Reasoning and Experiment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of its Learning, Connexions and Lan∣guages.</NOTE> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">By Bishop <HI>Berkley</HI> in his <HI>Theory of Vision;</HI> and <HI>Philoso∣phical Transactions,</HI> No. 402.</NOTE> "That the Objects of Sight and Touch are in∣tirely different and distinct Things; that there is no necessary Connection be∣tween them; that Things visible are only arbitrary Signs of Things tangible;
<PB N="78" REF="006859_0101_102AABB6B0032B10"/>
that the one hath the Nature of a Language with Regard to the other, and that the Connec∣tion between them is to be learned only by Expe∣rience, as that between Words and the Things signified by them:" And particularly, that as all visible Objects or Ideas are only in the Mind; so a Man born blind, and made to see, which must also be the Case of Infants, can have at first no Notion of Distance, nor of any Connec∣tion between Things visible and tangible, and con∣sequently, that both Distance and that Connec∣tion must be learn'd by long Trial and Experi∣ence. It must, therefore, be a Matter of great Exercise of Thought in an infant Mind to learn this Connection, and particularly, to learn the Notion of the various Distances and Situations of Things tangible, by its Observations on the various Degrees of Strength or Weakness, of Vividness or Faintness of the Light reflected from them, in the Things visible constantly connected with them. And, at the same time that it hath these Things to learn, which must be a laborious Work, as being the same Thing with learning a Language, it is also learning the Names of Things, and the Connection and Use of Words, which is another Language. And, as if all these were not Task enough, it hath all this While, to be learning how to use its Limbs; its Hands in handling, its Tongue, and other Organs of Speech, in making and imitating Sounds, and its whole Body in all its Exertions, and particularly, at length, the Poize of its Center of Gravity, and the Use of its Feet in walking.</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. ALL these Things require a great deal of earnest Application, and the Exercise of much Thought and Experience: So that it seems evi∣dent
<PB N="79" REF="006859_0102_102AABBA25562AA0"/>
that those little Creatures, from the Begin∣ning, do consider, reflect and think a prodigious deal more than we are commonly apt to imagine;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of the Ca∣pacity of Children, and the Re∣gard due to them.</NOTE> and I do not see how we can avoid admitting that the Soul's Capacity is as great from the first Moment as ever it is. For it is plain, from what hath been said, that they learn two distinct Languages within the two first Years of their Life to a good Degree of Perfection; I mean the Connection between tangi∣ble and visible Objects, and between both of them and Words, and besides this, a considera∣ble Degree of Dexterity in the Use of their Limbs, which is, doubtless, a great deal more than they ever learn in so much Time afterwards. And consequently the Reason why there appear so many little, low, weak and childish Things in them, which we are apt to despise and think them beneath our Notice, is not for want of good Sense and Capacity, but meerly for want of Ex∣perience and Opportunity for intellectual Im∣provements. Hence also it appears, that we ought to think little Children to be Persons of much more Importance than we usually appre∣hend them to be; and how indulgent we should be to their inquisitive Curiosity as being Strangers; with how much Candour, Patience and Care, we ought to bear with them and instruct them; with how much Decency, Honour and Integrity, we ought to treat them; and how careful it concerns us to be, not to say or do any Thing to them, or before them, that savours of Falshood or Deceit, or that is in any Kind indecent or vitious. <HI>Pueris maxima debetur Reverentia,</HI> is a good trite old Saying.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="80" REF="006859_0103_102AABBC8CF127F8"/>§ 4. FOR it is to be observed, in the next Place,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Knowledge of Persons, Relations and Duties.</NOTE> that while Children are acquir∣ing a general Knowledge of the sensible World about them, they are at the same time learning the Knowledge of the Persons with whom they converse; their Dependence on them, and the Re∣lations they stand in to them; and a Notion of <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum,</HI> and thence a very quick Sense of Justice and Injury, as well as of good Usage, Be∣nevolence and Gratitude; all which appear obvi∣ous to them from Consciousness and Reflection, and Attention to that inward, intuitive, intellectu∣al Light, which as I have observed (Chap. I. § 13. 14.) perpetually shines in upon their little Minds, from the DEITY, <HI>the Father of Lights,</HI> and <HI>the Father of their Spirits.</HI> Hence they soon apprehend the Relations of <HI>Causes</HI> and <HI>Effects,</HI> of <HI>Whole</HI> and <HI>Parts,</HI> of Things <HI>equal, greater</HI> or <HI>less,</HI> of Things <HI>like</HI> and <HI>unlike,</HI> of the <HI>same</HI> and Things <HI>different</HI> and <HI>contrary,</HI> of <HI>general Names</HI> and <HI>Notions,</HI> and Analogies from Things sensible to Things spiritual and moral, of Actions <HI>necessary</HI> and <HI>voluntary,</HI> and of Things done with <HI>Design</HI> and by <HI>Accident,</HI> &amp;c. And by Reflection and Observation they judge of others by them∣selves: So that in three or four Years, they do, with a litttle Teaching, begin to have a Notion of Persons, as being an intirely different and distinct Sort of Beings from meer Objects of Sense. They soon know that a Stone in falling, the Wa∣ter in running, the Wind in blowing, and the Fire in burning, &amp;c. knows not what it does, and neither acts voluntarily, nor with Design: Where∣as a Man or a Boy, they apprehend, if he does what is either pleasing or displeasing, beneficial
<PB N="81" REF="006859_0104_102AABBE4F1B5AF8"/>
or injurious to them, he knows what he does, and designs to do it, and might, if he would, do otherwise. From whence, as I said, they have a quick Sense of good or ill Usage, and consequently, of Right and Wrong, and of Gra∣titude or Resentment, according as they take themselves to be well, or ill treated.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. HENCE, with regard to what they do themselves, they, by Reflection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of their Notions of Praise and Blame, Shame and Guilt, &amp;c.</NOTE> soon acquire the Notions of Free-Agency, and of <HI>Praise</HI> or <HI>Blame,</HI> according as they are conscious of their doing well or ill; <HI>i. e.</HI> according as they are sensi∣ble they act a fit and a reasonable Part on the one Hand, or an unreasonable and injurious Part on the other. Thence they soon learn to have a Sense of <HI>Shame</HI> and <HI>Guilt</HI> upon their Consciousness of having done amiss, and of <HI>Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>Self-applause,</HI> when they think they have done well. And hence they quickly learn the Notions of <HI>Law, Conscience, Sin</HI> and <HI>Duty,</HI> especially if they have had the Rules explained, and been duly chastized or ap∣plauded when they have done ill or well, by those on whom they know they have a Dependance, and to whom they find themselves accountable; and to whom to account, as being both their Be∣nefactors and Governors, they are conscious it is fit and reasonable, as they know they stand in much Need of their Help and Conduct in order to their own Well-being. All these Things are obvious in Children of four, five and six Years old, and manifestly derive from that intellectual Light, of which I have often been speaking: And the great Concern of Culture, and a right Education, is to awaken their Attention to this
<PB N="82" REF="006859_0105_102AABC25C8F33F8"/>
inward intuitive Sense of True and False, Good and Bad, Right and Wrong; and to fix their Attachment to the one, and their Aversion to the other, by steadily affecting them with Applause or Blame, Pleasure or Pain, Joy or Grief, according as they affect or do the one or the other.</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. AND as the Intellect and Reason of Children thus manifestly appears to dawn and improve,<NOTE PLACE="marg">How they should be treated, &amp; taught the Notion of the Deity, and their Duty to him.</NOTE> it ought to be continually <HI>encouraged</HI> and <HI>assisted</HI> by those that are about them, and especi∣ally those that have the Conduct of them. As they are got into a World wherein every Thing is new and strange to them, and for want of Knowledge and Experience, they are liable to many Mistakes in their Ap∣prehensions, and to make a thousand Blunders in their Actions and Conduct; and yet in their original Simplicity and Well-meaning, are ordi∣narily very inquisitive, and willing to be taught and conducted; it is mightily incumbent on those to whose Care they are by Providence commit∣ted, whether Parents, Nurses, Guardians, Ma∣sters or Tutors, to consider them, with great Candor, as Strangers that need to be conducted and assisted; to be ready to answer their little Questions, and to teach them to reason by can∣didly reasoning with them; and to apply them∣selves with great Tenderness, Patience and As∣siduity, to guide and instruct them. And as they grow capable of considering the Connections of <HI>Causes</HI> and <HI>Effects,</HI> &amp;c. they should open their Minds, and turn their Attention to the Survey of all Nature, and lead them to observe the Contrivance, Beauty and Usefulness of every

and Well-being depends on the Esteem, Love and good Offices of others, and that these de∣pend on their own good Conduct, and good Of∣fices towards them; they should have it incul∣cated upon them, that as they would be secure from all Injuries, and the ill Treatment of others, so they must avoid every Thing that is injurious and abusive towards them; and as they would expect the Benevolence and good Offices of others, they must be full of Good-will, and ready to every good Office towards them; and conse∣quently, delight in every honest, faithful, kind and obliging Thing, whereby they may recom∣mend themselves to the Confidence, Esteem and Good-will of all Mankind with whom they have to do. And as they go on to enlarge their Ac∣quaintance with the World about them, and to have a Notion of their Connections with the Town in which they live, and the Government and Kingdom to which they belong, and, in ge∣neral, with the whole Species; they should be led on to a Sense of Order and publick Virtue, and the Love of their Country, and finally of the whole human Kind, and to look for their own Weal in that of the whole Community, and even of the whole moral System, and to a Con∣duct corresponding thereunto.</P>

In order to which, the widely different Natures and Interests of Soul and Body, and of Time and Eternity, should be explained to them, with the Evidences of a future State; and consequently, of how much Importance it is to them to be, in a good Mea∣sure, disengaged from the Body and Time, so short and uncertain; and to cultivate the Soul, and improve it in Knowledge and Virtue, of which they can never be dispossessed, not even by Death itself, they being Treasures which they can carry with them into another State, and that will last for ever.

But Care should be taken that these Exercises do not consist of meer Abstractions, and barren and useless Speculations, but be turn∣ed as much as possible to Facts, and Things practical and useful in Life.

general Survey of the mighty Works of God, both in Heaven and Earth; to which, as they further ripen, their Attention should be now more strongly turned by a Variety of Experiments.

and Understandings, and, at the same time, lead them to the most grand and august Apprehen∣sions of the DEITY, and of his most exten∣sive Benevolence to all <HI>his whole Family, in Hea∣ven and Earth.</HI> And from a Sense of the Beau∣ty, Harmony, Order and Usefulness appearing in the whole <HI>System of Nature,</HI> they are led to a Sense of the like Beauty, Harmony and Order, which ought to obtain in the <HI>moral System,</HI> and the Hap∣piness resulting from it, which now should be the Subject of their most intense Study, accord∣ing to that excellent Saying of <HI>Tully; Homo or∣tus est ad mundum contemplandum &amp; imitandum.</HI></P>
<P N="15">§ 15. FOR as the Mind, from the first Dawn∣ing of Intellect and Reason, hath been supposed, from the Contemplation of it∣self,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Theo∣logy and Morals.</NOTE> and the sensible World surrounding it, and the Instruction of those about it, to be convinced of the Existence of the DEITY, the Author of all Things, and gradually attain∣ing just Notions of Him who is the great <HI>Fa∣ther of Spirits;</HI> so now it must be led on further, in <HI>Moral Philosophy, Theology, Ethics,</HI> &amp;c. to the Contemplation of Him, and that World of Spirits derived from Him, dependent on Him, and subjected to his supreme Dominion and Go∣vernment, in which he seeks to lead them gra∣dually on thro' a Course of Discipline, to their highest Perfection and Happiness in their Know∣ledge of Him, Conformity to Him, and Enjoy∣ment of Him, their sovereign Good, as the great End of their Existence, and all his Dispensations towards them. Here then opens another vast Scene of necessary and eternal Truths. In order to which, the first Study is to gain a right Know∣ledge of ourselves, our own intellectual and ac∣tive
<PB N="92" REF="006859_0115_102AABDBB8A77E88"/>
Powers, our various Affections and Exer∣tions, by Conciousness and Reflection; and thence to form a Notion, not only of other created Spi∣rits, but especially of GOD the great Parent Spirit, by substituting the greatest both natural and moral Perfections we find in ourselves where∣with to conceive of Him and his Dispensa∣tions towards us, removing from them all Limi∣tation and Imperfection. And by the intellectual Light wherewith he perpetually irradiateth our Minds, we not only see his absolute Independance and necessary Existence, but also our own intire Dependance on Him, and our Relation and Obli∣gations to Him; from whence evidently resulteth the Fitness, Decency and Duty of all those Affec∣tions, and that Behaviour which we manifestly owe to <HI>Him,</HI> and are comprehended under the general Names of <HI>Piety</HI> and <HI>Adoration.</HI> And by the same Light attending our looking inward on ourselves, and considering our own Nature, and our Relations and Connections one with another, we, in like Manner, evidently discern what Affections and Behaviour are fit, decent and due from us to <HI>ourselves,</HI> and to <HI>each other,</HI> implied in the Terms <HI>Moderation, Probity</HI> and <HI>Benevolence;</HI> and also that Happiness and Self-enjoyment which result∣eth from being conscious of our affecting and be∣having accordingly, as well as the Remorse and Misery arising from our affecting and acting other∣wise. Thus our Perception of eternal Truth, and Love of Order, in Conformity to it, leadeth the Mind to its Union with the eternal God, and the Happiness of his everlasting Kingdom, in the Conduct and Government of the World, which consisteth in the universal Order, Harmony and

BUT as we are by the Condition of our Natures or Circumstances,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Oecono∣my and Po∣liticks.</NOTE> especi∣ally the human Species, cantoned out into various particular Societies, it is necessary, in order to our Perfection, that we be trained up to act a good Part, under the Discipline of these Societies in our Progress towards it.

Hence ariseth <HI>Polity,</HI> or the Art of good Government, both <HI>Civil</HI> and <HI>Ecclesiasti∣cal;</HI> which consisteth in the Communities agree∣ing on certain Rules and Laws founded in the common Interest, and enforced by proper Sanc∣tions, in Conformity to which, every Individual is to resign to the publick or prevailing Sense (at least as far as his Duty to God will permit) as being the safest and most rational Method he can take, in order to secure his own best Interest and Happiness. To which, therefore, it will much conduce, that every one be trained up in this Spirit of Resignation to the publick Sense, as far as possible, and in an ardent Love of the pub∣lick

<HEAD><HI>A BEAUTIFUL SUMMARY DESCRIPTION OF UNIVERSAL NATURE,</HI> By Bishop <HI>BERKELEY,</HI> in reasoning against the Sceptics, near the Beginning of the <HI>Second</HI> of his <HI>Three Dialogues.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LOOK! Are not the Fields covered with a delightful Verdure? Is there not something in the Woods and Groves, in the Rivers and clear Springs, that sooths, that softens, that trans∣ports the Soul? At the Prospect of the wide and deep Ocean, or some huge Mountain, whose Top is lost in the Clouds, or of an old gloomy Forest, are not our Minds filled with a pleasing Horror? Even in the Rocks and Desarts, is there not an agreeable Wildness? How sincere a Plea∣sure is it to behold the natural Beauties of the Earth! To preserve and renew our Relish for them, is not the Veil of Night alternately drawn over her Face, and doth she not change her Dress with the Seasons? How aptly are the Elements disposed? What Variety and Use in Stones and Metals, and even in the meanest Productions of Nature? What Delicacy, what Beauty, what Contrivance in vegetable and animal Bodies? How exquisitely are all Things suited as well to their
<PB N="98" REF="006859_0121_102AABED3AC808E0"/>
particular Ends, as to constitute apposite Parts of the Whole? And while they mutually aid and support, do they not also set off and illustrate each other? Raise now your Thoughts from this Ball of Earth, to all those wondrous Lumina∣ries that adorn the high Arch of Heaven. What an insupportably splendid and glorious Body is the Sun, the Center of this our System, and the inexhaustible Fountain of that vast aetherial Fluid, which is the Light and Life of this whole Crea∣tion? The Motion and Situation of the Planets, are they not admirable for Use and Order? Were those (miscalled <HI>Erratic</HI>) Globes e'er known to stray in their repeated Journeys through the path∣less Void? Do they not measure Areas round the Sun, ever proportioned to the Times? So fixed, so immutable are the Laws by which the unseen Author of Nature actuates the Universe! How vivid and radiant is the Lustre of the fixed Stars? How magnificent and rich that negligent Profu∣sion, with which they appear to be scattered throughout the whole azure Vault? Yet if you take the Telescope, it brings into your Sight a new Host of Stars that escape the naked Eye. Here they seem contiguous and minute, but to a nearer View, immense Orbs of Light, at various Distances, far sunk in the Abyss of Space! Now you must call Imagination to your Aid. The feeble narrow Sense cannot descry innumerable Worlds revolving round the central Fires; and in those Worlds the Energy of an All-perfect Mind display'd in endless Forms! But neither Sense nor Imagination are big enough to comprehend the boundless Extent, with all its glittering Furni∣ture! Though the labouring Mind exert and strain each Power to its utmost Reach, there still
<PB N="99" REF="006859_0122_102AABEF91FEA0E0"/>
stands out ungrasped a Surplusage immeasura∣ble! Yet all the vast Bodies that compose this mighty Frame, how distant and remote soever, are by some secret Mechanism, some divine Art and Force, linked in a mutual Dependance and Intercourse with each other; even with this Earth, which was almost slipt from my Thoughts, and lost in the Croud of Worlds! Is not the whole System immense, beautiful, glorious, be∣yond Expression, and beyond Thought? What Treatment then do those Philosophers deserve, who would deprive these noble and delightful Scenes of all Reality? How should those Prin∣ciples be entertained, that lead us to think all the visible Beauty of the Creation a false imaginary Glare?</P>

<P>O My GOD, if the greater Number of Mankind do not discover Thee in that glo∣rious Show of Nature which thou hast placed before our Eyes, it is not because thou art far from every one of us, for it is <HI>in Thee that we live, and move, and have our Being:</HI> Thou art pre∣sent to us more than any Object which we touch with our Hands, but our Senses and the Passions which they produce in us, turn our Attention from Thee. Thy Light <HI>shines in the midst of Darkness, but the Darkness comprehendeth it not.</HI> Thou, O Lord, dost every where display thyself: Thou shinest forth in all thy Works, but art not regarded by heedless and unthinking Man. The
<PB N="101" REF="006859_0124_102AABF3DCDE26E8"/>
whole Creation talks aloud of Thee, and echoes with the Repetition of Thy holy Name: But such is our Insensibility, that we are deaf to the great and universal Voice of Nature. Thou art every where about us, and within us, but we wander from ourselves, become Strangers to our own Souls, and do not apprehend Thy Presence. O Thou, who art the eternal Fountain of Light and Beauty; who art the Ancient of Days, with∣out Beginning, and without End: O Thou, who art the Life of all that truly live, those can never fail to find Thee who seek for Thee within them∣selves. But alas! the very Gifts which Thou be∣stowest upon us do so employ our Thoughts, that they divert us from perceiving the Hand that conveys them to us. We live in Thee, and by Thee, and yet we live without thinking of Thee: But, O Lord, what is Life in the Ignorance of Thee? A dead inactive Piece of Matter, a Flower that withers, a River that glides away, a Palace that hastens to its Ruin, a Picture made up of fading Colours, a Mass of shining Ore; these, and such Things as these, strike our Imagina∣tions, and make us sensible of their Existence, we regard them as Objects capable of giving us Pleasure, not considering that <HI>Thou</HI> conveyest to us, <HI>through</HI> them, all the Pleasure which we imagine <HI>they</HI> give us. Such empty Objects of Sense as are only the Shadows of Being, take up and engage our low and groveling Thoughts, while that Beauty which Thou hast poured out on Thy Creation is as a Veil that hides Thee from our Eyes. As Thou art a Being too pure and exalted to pass thro' our Senses, Thou art not regarded by Men who have debased their Nature, and made
<PB N="102" REF="006859_0125_102AABF71D603BB0"/>
themselves like the Beasts that perish. So infatu∣ated are they, that notwithstanding they know what is Truth and Good, Wisdom and Virtue, Law and Order, which (tho' the most real and stable Things) have neither Figure, nor Colour, nor Sound, nor Taste, nor Smell, nor any other sensible Quality, yet they can doubt of Thy Ex∣istence, because Thou art not apprehended by the grosser Organs of Sense. Wretches that we are! we consider Shadows as Realities, and Truth as a Phantom: That which is nothing is all to us, and that which is all appears to us as nothing. But what do we see in all Nature but Thee, O my God? Thou and only Thou appearest in every Thing. When I consider Thee, O Lord, I am swallowed up, and lost in the Contemplation of Thee. Every Thing besides Thee, even my own Existence, vanishes and disappears in Con∣templation of Thee: I am astonished and fall in∣to nothing when I think of Thee! The Man who does not see Thee has beheld nothing: He who does not taste Thee has a Relish of nothing; his Being is vain, and his Life but a Dream. How unhappy is that Soul who without the Sense of Thee has no God, no Hope, no Comfort to support him? On the contrary, how happy is the Man that searches, sighs and thirsts after Thee? But he only is fully happy, on whom thou liftest up the Light of Thy Countenance, and who, being conformed to Thee, enjoys in Thy loving Kindness the Completion of all his Desires. Thou therefore, O my God, art the God of my Life, my Joy and my Hope: <HI>Thou wilt guide me with Thy Counsel, and afterward re∣ceive me to Glory: Thou wilt shew me the Path
<PB N="103" REF="006859_0126_102AABF8A5329158"/>
of Life; in thy Presence is Fulness of Joy, and at thy right Hand there are Pleasures for evermore. Whom then have I in Heaven but Thee? And there is nothing in Earth that I will desire in Comparison of thee. My Flesh and my Heart faileth: But Thou, O my GOD, art the Strength of my Heart, and my Portion for ever.</HI></P>

<P>WHAT is here attempted, is a short System of <HI>Ethics</HI> or <HI>Morals</HI> (chiefly for the Use of young Beginners) which have, of late, been called <HI>The Religion of Nature;</HI> by which I would not be understood to mean a System of Truths and Du∣ties which meer <HI>natural Reason</HI> would ever, of it∣self, have discovered, in the present Condition of Mankind, without the Assistance of <HI>Revelation</HI> or Instruction; for it is but a very little of GOD and Religion, or of Truth and Duty, that Man, in his present State, utterly uninstructed, is able to discover by his meer natural Powers, as the Fact hath abundantly demonstrated, where the ancient Instructions were lost. Nor can it, indeed, be ima∣gined, from the Goodness of GOD, that when he first brought Man into Being, a Stranger to every Thing about him, that he would leave him to grope out every Thing that was necessary, or even expedient, in order to answer the End of his Being, his true Happiness, without Instruction, even in Language and Nature, as well as Religion and Morals; or, that when he had been surprized by a Temptation, and fallen into Sin, that he would leave him to pe∣rish without giving him further Instructions, to be handed down to his Posterity, how he and they should return to their Duty, and regain His Fa∣vour. And that the Fact was accordingly, we are assured from the most ancient Accounts of the first Condition of Mankind. What I would therefore be understood to mean by <HI>Ethics,</HI> or <HI>the Religion of Nature,</HI> is, That System of Truths and Duties, which, tho' they are not obvious to our weak Rea∣son,
<PB N="vi" REF="006859_0131_102AAC072F091788"/>
without Revelation or Instruction, yet when discovered, whether by the one or the other, do evi∣dently appear, upon due Consideration, to be founded in the first Principles of Reason and Nature; in the Nature of GOD and Man, and the various Relations that subsist between them; and from thence to be capable even of strict Demonstration.</P>
<P>WE know there are a great Number of Truths in <HI>Mathematicks</HI> and <HI>Natural Philosophy,</HI> which not One in Ten Thousand of the Bulk of Mankind would ever have thought of, if it had not been for such great Men as <HI>Euclid, Apollonius, Archimedes</HI> and Sir <HI>Isaac Newton,</HI> &amp;c. which yet may, safely, and with great Advantage, be received upon, their Authority, and be accordingly practised upon, by those who have not Leisure or Ability to attend to the Reasons of them: And now they have led the Way, it is not very difficult for those, who are capa∣ble of thinking closely, to enter into the Demonstra∣tions of them: The Case is much the same as to mo∣ral Truths and Duties, with regard to the Autho∣rity of Prophets and Law-givers. It is the Part of the Prophet or Law-giver, as such, to discover Truths, and enjoin Laws, as Rules of Behaviour to the People, who are to receive them upon their Authority, as having but little Leisure or Capacity to exercise their Reason about them, and therefore act rationally in so doing; And it is the Part of the <HI>Philosopher,</HI> as such, as far as it is practicable, to enter into the Reasons and Demonstrations, on which those Truths and Duties are originally founded.</P>
<P>SUCH a short Delineation of <HI>Morals,</HI> may, per∣haps, be of some Use, especially in these Times, wherein there is a Sect arisen, or rather revived, that is continually decrying <HI>Morality,</HI> as tho' it were only carnal Reason, and no Part of <HI>Christiani∣ty,</HI>
<PB N="vii" REF="006859_0132_102AAC099C513CB0"/>
nor scarce consistent with it: This, it may be presumed, they would scarcely do, if they duly con∣sidered what <HI>Morality</HI> truly is. And, on the other Hand, as one Extreme is apt to beget another, it is to be feared there may be another Sect arising, or gaining Ground, who from too just an Indignation at those absurd Notions of <HI>Christianity,</HI> are in Dan∣ger, for want of due Consideration, of not only set∣ting light by <HI>that,</HI> but even of losing all serious Sense of the true Extent and Obligations of <HI>Mora∣lity</HI> itself. It is therefore the Design of the follow∣ing Pages, to endeavour to give a just Notion of it, and the Reasons on which it is founded, and to shew its Extent and vast Importance, and what Con∣nection there is between <HI>it</HI> and <HI>Christianity.</HI></P>
<P>I would only advertise this one Thing further; That no Speculation or Demonstration whatsoever, is of any further real Use to us, than so far forth as it directs or engages us in Life and Practice, on which our Happiness all depends. And, as our Rea∣son in these Things, is, at best, but very dark and weak, it is of the greatest Importance to us, that we diligently study the holy Oracles, in which we have the sublimest and most advantageous Instructions and Incentives to Practice, with regard to these Mat∣ters, which are of the utmost Importance to our true and everlasting Happiness. However, as we are reasonable Creatures, and obliged, as such, to yield unto GOD, the Author of our Beings, a <HI>reasona∣ble Service,</HI> it may be of very good Use for us, as far as it will go, with an implicit Submission to Him for the rest, to exercise our Reason upon these great and important Subjects.</P>

<HEAD><HI>ETHICS:</HI> OR Moral Philosophy.</HEAD>
<DIV2 TYPE="introduction">
<HEAD>THE INTRODUCTION. Of the Nature of <HI>Ethics,</HI> or <HI>Moral Philo∣sophy,</HI> in general.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. AS <HI>Natural Philosophy</HI> is the Know∣ledge of the natural World, or the World of Bodies, and the general Laws of the corporeal Nature, to∣gether with all those practical Matters thereon depending, that promote our comfortable Sub∣sistence and Well-being in this present State; so <HI>Moral Philosophy</HI> is the Knowledge of the moral World; the World of Spirits, or intelligent free Agents, and the general Laws of the moral Na∣ture; together with all that practical Conduct and Behaviour thereon depending, that is necessary to promote our true Happiness, both in our present and future State. And as the <HI>NOETICA</HI> imply all those Instructions and Means, that re∣late to the Improvement and Conduct of our
<PB N="2" REF="006859_0135_102AAC10F6CD9A20"/>
Understandings in Pursuit of the Knowledge of Truth: So the <HI>ETHICA</HI> imply all those In∣structions and Means that relate to the Regula∣tion and Conduct of our Affections, Actions and Behaviour, in Pursuit of the Enjoyment of our true and chief Good.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE World of intelligent free Agents, in∣deed, comprehends the whole System of created Spirits, both Angels and Men, and whatever other Species there may be, considered as being derived from, and under the Conduct and Go∣vernment of Almighty GOD, the Author, the Father and Lord of all. But what I mean chiefly to insist upon, is, the <HI>Knowledge of ourselves,</HI> as we are <HI>Men,</HI> or a moral System of rational Ani∣mals, in all the Relations wherein we stand, both with regard to GOD, ourselves, and one ano∣ther, with a Behaviour suitable thereunto (without considering us particularly either in our <HI>oeconomical</HI> or <HI>political</HI> Capacities) which is the Foundation of all the rest, and is usually termed <HI>Ethics.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>ETHICS</HI> is the Art of living happily, by the right Knowledge of ourselves, and the Practice of Virtue: Our <HI>Happiness</HI> being the End, and <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> the Means to that End.</P>
<P N="4">4. WE are said to live happily when we en∣joy ourselves, and all that is really good for us, in the whole of our Nature and Duration; <HI>i. e.</HI> considered, not only as sensitive, but as reasona∣ble, free, active, social and immortal Creatures. For <HI>Happiness</HI> means that Pleasure which ariseth in us from our Enjoyment of ourselves, and all that is really good for us, or suitable to our Natures, and conducive to our Happiness in the whole.</P>
<P N="5"><PB N="3" REF="006859_0136_102AAC1562391BC0"/>5. THE Enjoyment of ourselves, and all that is truly good, depends on a good Habit, or State of the Soul, united with, and delighting in its proper Objects, which are <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good;</HI> the first being the Object of the Understanding, and the other of the Will and Affections: And this good Habit is the same Thing with <HI>Virtue.</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. <HI>VIRTUE</HI> consists in that Integrity, Firmness and Stability of the Soul, whereby we do honestly and stedfastly persist, in spite of all Temptations to the contrary, in the Love and Practice of <HI>moral Good,</HI> and the Hatred and For∣bearance of <HI>moral Evil: Vice</HI> is the contrary.</P>
<P N="7">7. <HI>MORAL Good</HI> consists in freely chusing and doing whatsoever Truth and right Reason dictate as necessary to be chosen and done, in order to our true Happiness: <HI>Moral Evil</HI> the contrary; for moral Good must mean, the Good of a moral Agent; <HI>i. e.</HI> of rational, conscious, free, self-exerting and self-determining Agent.</P>
<P N="8">8. THERE are two Things necessary to be con∣sidered, with respect to the Nature of <HI>moral Good: viz.</HI> The <HI>Criterion,</HI> or Test, by which, in the right Use of our Reason, we determine what we ought to do, or forbear; and the <HI>Obli∣gations</HI> we thereupon find ourselves under to the Practice of it.</P>
<P N="9">9. (I.) THE <HI>Criterion</HI> or Test, whereby we determine what we ought to do or forbear, or what those Actions and Forbearances are, which are to be chosen and done, is the <HI>natural Good</HI> of them, or that Pleasure and Happiness in the whole of our Nature and Duration, which natu∣rally attends them: For we find by Experience, that some Things, Affections and Actions, are, in the very Nature of them, attended with Pleasure
<PB N="4" REF="006859_0137_102AAC17CCF6DCE8"/>
or Happiness, either to the Mind, as perceptive of Truth, or to the Will and Affections, as de∣sirous of Good; and others with Pain or Misery, in respect to the one or the other. In some we have a quick Sense of the Decent and Amiable, which delight the Mind; and in others, of the Deformed and Odious, which displease it: In some we perceive the Advantage, in others the Mischief attending them, to ourselves or others; and accordingly, the former are attended with inward Tranquility, Acquiescence, and Self-ap∣probation, and the latter with Anxiety, Remorse, and Self-reproach. And as Ease, Pleasure or <HI>Happiness,</HI> is what we call <HI>natural Good;</HI> so Un∣easiness, Pain or <HI>Misery,</HI> we call <HI>natural Evil.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. BUT in order to make a right Judgment of <HI>natural Good</HI> and <HI>Evil,</HI> as being the Test of <HI>moral,</HI> we must (as I said) take into the Account, the <HI>whole of our Nature and Duration,</HI> as being <HI>sensitive</HI> and <HI>rational, social</HI> and <HI>immortal</HI> Creatures. It must therefore be the Good and Happiness of the <HI>whole human Nature,</HI> and the <HI>whole moral System,</HI> in <HI>Time,</HI> and to all <HI>Eternity.</HI> Hence the Good of the <HI>animal Body,</HI> or the <HI>Pleasure of Sense,</HI> is but imaginary, and ceaseth to be <HI>Good,</HI> and hath even the Nature of <HI>Evil,</HI> so far forth as it is inconsistent with the Good and Happiness of the <HI>Soul:</HI> Which is also the Case of <HI>private Good,</HI> so far forth as it is inconsistent with the <HI>Good</HI> of the <HI>Publick;</HI> and <HI>temporal Good,</HI> so far forth as it is inconsistent with that which is <HI>eter∣nal.</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. AND this our <HI>Good</HI> and Happiness in the whole, does necessarily coincide with, and even result from, the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of Things, or Things, Affections and Actions, considered as
<PB N="5" REF="006859_0138_102AAC1954083450"/>
being what they really are;<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Clarke,</HI> and <HI>Wollaston.</HI></NOTE> for thus to consider them, is the same Thing with considering them as being <HI>fit,</HI> and tending, in the <HI>Nature</HI> of them, to render our rational, social and immortal <HI>Na∣ture,</HI> in the whole ultimately happy: And such Affections and Actions, correspondent to such Natures and Characters, must be necessarily and eternally fit; it being impossible to conceive of such Natures and Relations, but such moral Af∣fections and Actions will result as <HI>fit</HI> and <HI>right,</HI> and the contrary, as <HI>unfit</HI> and <HI>wrong.</HI> So that the <HI>general Good</HI> of the whole, the <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Fitness</HI> of Things, and <HI>the Truth</HI> of Things, or Things considered as being what they are, are, as I apprehend, really coincident, and do, in Effect, come to the same Thing, in settling the Criterion of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong,</HI> or the Test whereby we must determine what we are to chuse or avoid, and to do or forbear.</P>
<P N="12">12. <HI>MORAL Good</HI> must therefore consist in freely chusing and acting conformable to the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Things;</HI> or to Things, Af∣fections and Actions, considered as being what <HI>they</HI> really are, <HI>i. e.</HI> as tending, or not tending to our true Happiness, as being what <HI>we</HI> really are: Or (which is the same Thing) in chusing and acting according to the <HI>Fitness of Things,</HI> or to Things, Affections and Actions, considered as fit or subservient, in their own Nature, to pro∣mote our best <HI>Good</HI> and Happiness <HI>in the whole.</HI> And this again is the same Thing with acting ac∣cording to <HI>right Reason</HI> (which has been some∣times called the <HI>Criterion</HI>) it being by the right Use of our Reason that we apprehend. Things
<PB N="6" REF="006859_0139_102AAC1BD5477E98"/>
as being what they really are, and discover which those Things, Affections and Actions are, that do, in the Nature of them, tend to our true Happiness in the whole; and thereby judge what we must do and avoid, and form Rules by which we must act in all our Conduct and Behaviour, so as to be truly happy.</P>
<P N="13">13. (II.) THE <HI>Obligation</HI> we are under, as moral Agents, to practise accordingly, implieth some <HI>Law,</HI> binding us, under certain Penalties, to such Actions as are morally Good, and to forbear the contrary; and this constitutes the Notions of <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Sin,</HI> and is two-fold, <HI>Natural</HI> and <HI>Inter∣nal,</HI> or <HI>External</HI> and <HI>Moral.</HI></P>
<P N="14">14. (I.) THE <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>internal</HI> Obligation to the Practice of moral Virtue ariseth from the <HI>Law</HI> of our <HI>Nature,</HI> or that Law which GOD hath established within our own Breasts, and in the Frame of our Nature. And this is the Law of <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Conscience,</HI> together with the Law of <HI>Self-love,</HI> and <HI>Self-preservation,</HI> and the Law of <HI>Benevolence.</HI></P>
<P N="15">15. (1.) THE Law of <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>Conscience</HI> is, I think, the same Thing which some have called the <HI>moral Sense,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Shaftsbury, Hutch<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on,</HI> and <HI>Preceptor▪</HI> or <HI>Turnbull.</HI></NOTE> being a kind of quick and almost intuitive Sense of Right and Wrong, deriving, as I conceive, from the perpetual Pre∣sence and Irradiation of the Deity in our Minds, and dictating with a strong and commanding Force what is reasonable, fair and decent, and so fit and right to be done, and giving us Applause and Satisfaction when we conform to it, and blaming and reproaching us, and filling us with Uneasiness and Remorse, when we act contrary
<PB N="7" REF="006859_0140_102AAC1D5C699710"/>
to its Dictates: It being the Law of our Nature, that we should always affect and act conformable to the inward Sense of our own Minds and Con∣sciences. And those consequent pleasing or un∣easy Sentiments, considering it as a Law, are its Sanctions.</P>
<P N="16">16. (2.) THE Law of <HI>Self-love</HI> and <HI>Self-pre∣servation,</HI> which makes us solicitous for the Con∣tinuance of our Existence, and the Enjoyment of ourselves, and ariseth from the Consciousness of our Existence, and of Pleasure or Pain, natural∣ly attending, certain Conditions in which we are, or maybe, or the contrary; which therefore are its Sanctions. For it is manifest that we are, by the Author of our Nature, laid under a Necessity of valuing ourselves and our own <HI>In∣terest,</HI> and of seeking and pursuing our own <HI>Pre∣servation</HI> and <HI>Well-being</HI> or Happiness, and what∣ever we find tends to it, or is connected with it; and consequently that of the Society to which we belong, with which we find our own is, in the Nature of Things, necessarily connected.</P>
<P N="17">17. FROM whence ariseth (thirdly) the Law of <HI>Benevolence,</HI> or that Disposition we find also implanted in us towards the Good of others, a∣rising from Reflection, whereby we are led to put ourselves in each other's Stead, and to have a secret Pleasure or Uneasiness in the good or ill Condition of others, from a Consciousness of our own, in the like Situation; which Sentiments therefore are its Sanctions. This Principle makes us desirous of each other's Esteem and Good-will, and puts us upon doing what we know may be pleasing and advantageous to each other, and to the whole; so that <HI>self</HI> and <HI>social Good</HI> can∣not
<PB N="8" REF="006859_0141_102AAC1FADDD2E30" MS="y"/>
be considered in themselves, as at all interfer∣ing, but as being intirely coincident and subser∣vient to each other.</P>
<P N="18">18. BUT while we rest here, and act upon no other Views or Motives than these <HI>Laws of our Nature</HI> suggest, without considering them as being the Laws or the GOD (or the Author) of Nature; though what we do, may be said, according to the common Acceptation, to be meerly <HI>morally good</HI> or <HI>evil,</HI> and <HI>virtuous</HI> or <HI>vicious;</HI> yet there will be nothing in it (however firm and stable our Con∣duct be) that can properly be called <HI>Religion,</HI> which must ever enter into the just and complete Notion of <HI>Morality;</HI> for this must be understood to comprehend every Thing that can either direct or influence our moral Behaviour, and conse∣quently must consider us in all the Relations wherein we stand, not only to ourselves and one another, but, above all, to the great Author of our Being, on whom we do intirely depend, and to whom we are therefore, in all Reason, ac∣countable.</P>
<P N="19">19. (II.) The <HI>external</HI> and <HI>moral Obligation</HI> we are under to those Actions and Forbearances above-mentioned, ariseth from <HI>moral Government,</HI> or the Consideration that they are the Will and Law of a Superior who aims at our Happiness in enjoying them, to whom we are therefore ac∣countable for our Behaviour, and by whom we shall be rewarded or punished; <HI>i. e.</HI> made to feel Pleasure or Pain, according as we behave well or ill (which are its Sanctions:) So that this Obli∣gation takes its Force from the former, and this is two-fold, <HI>political</HI> and <HI>religious.</HI></P>
<P N="20">20. (1.) THE <HI>political Obligation</HI> to the Prac∣tice
<PB N="9" REF="006859_0142_102AAC2205A92478" MS="y"/>
of these moral Actions and Forbearances, is the Consideration that they are the publick Will, or the Will and <HI>Law of the Society</HI> or Govern∣ment we live under, and to which we are ac∣countable (whether indeed it be a <HI>Family</HI> or a <HI>State</HI>) enforced by the Sanctions of temporal Re∣wards and Punishments. In this View <HI>moral Laws</HI> become <HI>political Laws,</HI> and <HI>moral Good, po∣litical Good,</HI> to which many others might be add∣ed, for promoting of the publick Weal.</P>
<P N="21">21. BUT here again, tho' GOD is the Founder of Government, both oeconomical and political, yet while we rest on this Foot, and act meerly under these political Views, and with a Regard only to our Interest in this World, tho' we may be said to be meer <HI>moral Men</HI> (as that Expression is commonly used) or <HI>good Citizens,</HI> and <HI>good Common-wealthsmen,</HI> we cannot be said to be <HI>religious,</HI> no, not even in those Actions that relate to GOD himself. But,</P>
<P N="22">22. (2.) THE <HI>religious Obligation</HI> we are un∣der to those Actions and Forbearances that are necessary to our Happiness in the whole, is the Consideration that they are the Will and <HI>Law of GOD,</HI> our Creator, Preserver, and supreme mo∣ral Governor, the great Author, Head and Lord of the whole social System, enforced by the Sanctions of <HI>eternal Rewards</HI> and <HI>Punishments,</HI> to whom we are justly accountable for all our Be∣haviour, and by whom we must expect to be treated well or ill, according as that shall be found to be good or bad.</P>
<P N="23">23. FOR it will appear hereafter, that they must be the Will and Law of GOD concerning us, because He being perfectly happy, and Self-suffi∣cient
<PB N="10" REF="006859_0143_102AAC2596C34540"/>
to his own Happiness, cannot aim at any Advantage to himself, in giving us Being, or in a∣ny of his Dispensations towards us; and consequent∣ly, that his great End must be our Happiness; and that this he will consider as <HI>his</HI> Interest, his De∣light and Glory, that his rational Creatures be in the whole, a happy System, by doing what is fit and right upon all Occasions. It being there∣fore his Aim that we be happy, whatsoever does, in the Nature of it, and according to the Con∣stitution which he hath made, tend to his Ho∣nour and our true Happiness, as being therefore fit and right, must be his <HI>Will</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> concern∣ing us, and consequently our <HI>Duty,</HI> and what is contrary thereto, must be <HI>Sin.</HI></P>
<P N="24">24. THAT, therefore, which constitutes the Nature of <HI>Religion,</HI> and denominates our Actions and Behaviour <HI>religious,</HI> and makes <HI>Religion</HI> and <HI>Morality,</HI> in the complete Notion of it, coinci∣dent, is, That we forbear whatsoever tends to our Misery, and do every Thing that tends to our Happiness in the whole, in Obedience to the Will of GOD, and from a Sense of Duty to Him, and in View of his All-seeing Eye, and the Account we are to give of ourselves to Him.</P>
<P N="25">25. SO that upon the whole it appears, That <HI>Morality,</HI> in the just Extent of it, is the same Thing with the <HI>Religion of Nature,</HI> or that <HI>Re∣ligion</HI> which is founded in the <HI>Nature</HI> of Things; and that it may be defined, <HI>the Pursuit of our true Happiness by Thinking, Affecting and Acting, according to the Laws of Truth and right Reason, under a Sense of the Duty that we owe to Almighty GOD, and the Account we must expect to give of ourselves to Him.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Crousaz</HI>'s <HI>Art of Thinking,</HI> Page 60.

<PB N="11" REF="006859_0144_102AAC283B8D25D0"/>
<HI>Duty</HI> are thus necessarily connected, it must be our Business in this Essay, to search out all the <HI>Truths</HI> that relate both to <HI>ourselves,</HI> to <HI>GOD,</HI> and our <HI>Fellow Creatures,</HI> and thence to deduce the several <HI>Duties</HI> that do necessarily result from them.</P>
<P N="26">26. NOW these may be all reduced to that grand ancient Principle of true Wisdom, <HI>Know thyself;</HI> which must imply, not meerly the Knowledge of ourselves, singly considered, but also in all the Relations wherein we stand; for this is the Knowledge of ourselves in the whole: And because we are <HI>active</HI> as well as <HI>intelligent</HI> Creatures, and our Happiness depends on <HI>Action</HI> as well as <HI>Thinking,</HI> it must therefore be understood to mean a <HI>practical Knowledge.</HI> I shall accord∣ingly explain this Enquiry under these <HI>six</HI> follow∣ing Heads, which, in order the better to bring them down into Life and Action, I chuse to ex∣press them generally in the first Person, or in the Manner of a Conversation with ourselves; which Method may, perhaps, be most useful, in order to teach young People how to reason with them∣selves upon these great and important Subjects to the best Advantage.</P>
<P N="27">27. LET therefore every one, in order to the right Knowledge of <HI>himself,</HI> and his <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Happiness,</HI> and that he may the more effectually be engaged in Practice, thus seriously reflect and enquire concerning himself.

<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP I. <HI>Of the</HI> Nature of Man, <HI>his</HI> Excellencies <HI>and</HI> Imperfections.</HEAD>
<P N="1">§ 1. (I.) IT is <HI>first</HI> necessary that we consi∣der the <HI>Truths</HI> contained in the <HI>Spe∣culative</HI> Part of this Science, relat∣ing to <HI>GOD</HI> and <HI>ourselves:</HI> And as we take our Rise to the Knowledge of GOD and his Conduct towards us, from the Know∣ledge of ourselves, and our Intercourse one with another; we must therefore begin with this, and in order hereunto, let every one seriously ask him∣self this Question; I. <HI>What am I?</HI> A Question that I doubt few seriously think of, or much con∣cern themselves about, and so live and die great Strangers to themselves, however near and dear that <HI>Self</HI> of ours is to us! And that he may duly answer this Enquiry, let him thus consider and reason with himself.</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. AS I am certain from the Perceptions and Operations of my own Mind, that <HI>I am,</HI> or have a Being; so I know that I am not a <HI>Stock,</HI> a
<PB N="14" REF="006859_0147_102A7B3A04AAC748"/>
<HI>Stone,</HI> or a <HI>Tree;</HI> for they have manifestly no Sense or Activity: Whereas I am conscious that I can <HI>see, hear, taste, smell</HI> and <HI>feel,</HI> and enjoy <HI>Pleasure,</HI> and suffer <HI>Pain,</HI> and can spontaneously <HI>exert</HI> myself, and <HI>act</HI> and move from Place to Place, in Pursuance of the one, which I <HI>love</HI> and <HI>delight</HI> in, and for avoiding of the other, which I <HI>hate</HI> and <HI>dread.</HI> All which are much nobler Powers and Faculties than those inanimate Beings are furnished with.</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. NOR yet am I a <HI>Beast,</HI> a <HI>Horse,</HI> a <HI>Dog,</HI> or an <HI>Ox,</HI> &amp;c. for tho' they appear to see, hear, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and to feel Pleasure and Pain as I do, and can move themselves spontaneously from Place to Place; yet they have but low, groveling Sensa∣tions, Exertions and Enjoyments. They appear to have no Notion of any Thing but the Objects of Sense, can conceive nothing of Duty and Sin, and seem capable of no Enjoyment of any Thing but Meat and Drink, and the Means of continu∣ing their Species, and defending themselves; and these only are the Things to which their Exertions and Activity tend.</P>
<P N="4">§ 4. WITH Regard to these, they have, in∣deed, a wonderful Sagacity, and what looks like Reasoning, Design and Contrivance, and a social Tendency; but these do not seem to be any Thing of their own, because they have them ori∣ginally, and do not acquire them by Teaching, Trial and Industry. This Sagacity therefore seems to be what we call an <HI>Instinct;</HI> by which Word, nothing else can be meant, but that they are rather passively acted and conducted by some other Being; some governing Mind on whom they depend, according to certain Laws of Na∣ture which He hath established, than that they act
<PB N="15" REF="006859_0148_102AAC302AB50390"/>
from any Principle of Deliberation and Design within themselves.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. THESE Sensations, Appetites and Exer∣tions, indeed, I find I have in common with them; but then I am conscious of vastly nobler Powers and Faculties than these. For I find I can <HI>reflect</HI> and look into my own Mind, and consider my∣self and my own Powers and Actions, and their Objects: I can attend to the Light of the <HI>pure Intellect,</HI> and <HI>compare</HI> one Thing with another, and observe their several <HI>Relations,</HI> and abstract and give general Names. I can <HI>judge</HI> of True and False, and of Right and Wrong, and deli∣berate and weigh Things, and <HI>reason</HI> and infer one Thing from another, and reduce them into <HI>Me∣thod</HI> and Order, according to their various Con∣nections and Dependences. I can <HI>excite</HI> Imagi∣nations and Conceptions of Things past or absent, and recollect them in my Mind at Pleasure, and reject or <HI>keep</HI> them under my Consideration as I please, at least in a good Measure, and am at <HI>Liberty</HI> to suspend judging till I have carefully ex∣amined them, and to <HI>act,</HI> or not to act, in Conse∣quence of my Deliberations, as I think fit. In the Impressions of Sense indeed, and the Perceptions of Evidence, I am passive, but in all these I am evidently active, and can chuse or refuse, will or nill, act or forbear, from a Principle of Self-ex∣ertion; which are all truly great and noble Pow∣ers.</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. I CAN, moreover, in Consequence of these Abilities, contrive and project <HI>Ends</HI> and <HI>Means,</HI> and Reasons of acting, and <HI>Rules</HI> to act by, and foresee much of the Events of my Con∣duct. I can give <HI>Laws,</HI> and propose Motives to myself or others, and exact an Account of
<PB N="16" REF="006859_0149_102AAC32A21F88E0"/>
myself or them, and give an Account to myself or others, whether I or they do, or do not act according to those Laws. And I find, that as I <HI>love</HI> or <HI>hate</HI> Things according as they are agreea∣ble or disagreeable to me; so I have <HI>Hopes</HI> or <HI>Fears, Joys</HI> or <HI>Griefs,</HI> according as I feel, or have in View, Pleasures or Pains, and am <HI>conscious</HI> of having done well or ill, and that my own <HI>Con∣science</HI> will not fail to <HI>justify</HI> and <HI>applaud,</HI> or <HI>ac∣cuse</HI> and <HI>condemn</HI> me accordingly; and as I feel great <HI>Joy</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI> in having done what I apprehend to be right, so I feel no less <HI>Shame, Horror,</HI> and <HI>Remorse,</HI> when I have done what is wrong.</P>
<P N="7">§ 7. FROM hence I not only know that I have a Being, but also that when I am in tole∣rable Circumstances, and do well, I have a great Enjoyment of that Being; that it is very dear to me, and that I am, above all Things, concerned to preserve and continue it, and to make it as com∣fortable and happy as ever I can; and am there∣fore desirous to acquire and enjoy all the Means and Accommodations, the Goods of the Mind, Body or Fortune, that are necessary and conve∣nient for that Purpose; which I have also a great Value for, in Proportion to their Subserviency to that End, and am very <HI>fearful</HI> of being deprived, and very apt to be <HI>displeased</HI> or feel Resentment at any One that would deprive me of them, and <HI>grateful</HI> to any One that does any Thing towards furnishing me with them, or securing them to me. And all these Desires and Affections of the <HI>private Kind,</HI> are evidently planted in our Na∣ture to be subservient to our personal Subsistence and Well-being.</P>
<P N="8"><PB N="17" REF="006859_0150_102AAC35B3A177E0" MS="y"/>§ 8. AND as I can look back and remem∣ber what I have been knowing to in my Time; so I can imagine a Time when I was not, and con∣ceive a Notion of a great Number of Ages and Transactions before me, and of an endless Suc∣cession of Ages and Transactions to come. And I cannot only conceive that I may, but cannot refrain from being earnestly desirous, in some Condition or other, to bear a Part in them, and to enjoy myself happily through all imaginable Periods of Duration: So that though I know there must have been a Time when I began to be, yet I am solicitous that I may never cease to be, and to enjoy myself; and cannot avoid having Hopes of this, even after Death, since this Life turns to but little Account. All these are so many Facts, and I am conscious and intuitively certain of them, if I look carefully within my∣self. And such are the Properties of my <HI>Soul</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI> which is properly <HI>myself,</HI> my reasonable and active Nature.</P>
<P N="9">§ 9. BUT besides these Things which relate to my <HI>Soul (myself,</HI> or <HI>spiritual Nature</HI>) I find that I have a wonderfully contrived, and admira∣bly useful Engine, <HI>my Body,</HI> which I constantly carry about me, and animate throughout (being tied and confined to it by the present Laws of my Nature) consisting of a vast Number and Variety of Parts and Organs, exquisitely framed and fit∣ted to each other, and to all the Functions, Pow∣ers and Operations of my Soul; my Eyes to see, my Ears to hear, my Tongue to speak, my Hands to handle, and my Feet to walk, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> not to mention a thousand Instances of the most wise Design and Contrivance, in all the inward Parts throughout, for all the Purposes of the
<PB N="18" REF="006859_0151_102AAC38349FC570" MS="y"/>
Animal Oeconomy, which are not immediately subject to my own Will and Activity.) Upon the Account of which, as well as the abovementioned Powers of my Soul, I must confess that, howe∣ver I came to be, I am indeed <HI>fearfully and won∣derfully made.</HI></P>
<P N="10">§ 10. I also find, upon looking about me, an endless Variety of sensible Objects; a glorious Heaven above me, and a spacious Earth beneath me, furnished with a surprizing Variety of Inha∣bitants, all connected (together with my own Body, one of the most curious Machines of them all) in a most wonderful Manner one with ano∣ther. So that it is manifest from their Depend∣ence and Subserviency, that they are contrived and designed to constitute, as in Fact they do, one harmonious, beautiful and useful System; one complete and intire Whole; in which I find every Thing fitted, in the best Manner, to my own Conveniencies and Pleasures, both for the com∣fortable Subsistence of my Body, and the En∣tertainment and Delight of my Soul; but so, that it was, at the same time, the manifest De∣sign of them to excite, engage, direct and em∣ploy my Activity, without which I find I cannot comfortably enjoy either myself or them.</P>
<P N="11">§ 11. I CAN moreover carry my Thoughts and Imaginations throughout the vast Spaces of Heaven and Earth, and have a mighty Curiosity to pry and search out the Secrets and Laws of Na∣ture, and discover and conceive, as much as I can, of the great Author of it, and what Sort of Behaviour and Conduct is suitable to my Na∣ture, and the Relation I stand in to Him and my Fellow Creatures, as tending to make me and them happy, and as such, must be amiable, and
<PB N="19" REF="006859_0152_102AAC3A0179FDA0"/>
cannot fail of approving itself, not only to my own Reason and Conscience, but also to Him and all reasonable Beings, whose Esteem and good Will I am, from a Tendency founded in Nature itself, very solicitous to obtain. (<HI>Introd.</HI> 15. 16. 17.)</P>
<P N="12">§ 12. Of which, as I know there are a great Number of my own Kind, so I cannot reasona∣bly doubt but there are others of various Orders above me, which may probably have other and nobler Senses than those five narrow Inlets that I am acquainted with, and confined to, and far greater and nobler Abilities, both of Understand∣ing and Activity, than I am furnished with. Such I can easily conceive to be possible; and, from the various Gradations in Perfection of Being, in the several Tribes below me, it is very probable there may be the like Gradations in several Tribes of Beings above me.</P>
<P N="13">§ 13. As to those of my own Species (from which by Analogy I may form some Notion of them) I find we were evidently made for Society, being furnished with the Power of <HI>Speech</HI> as well as <HI>Reason,</HI> whereby we are capable of entering into the Understanding of each other's Minds and Sentiments, and of holding mutual Inter∣course and Conversation one with another, and jointly conspiring to promote our common Well-being; to which we are naturally led by a Prin∣ciple of <HI>Benevolence,</HI> and <HI>social Dispositions</HI> and <HI>Affections,</HI> sounded in the Frame and Condition of our Nature, which not only placeth us in the various Relations of <HI>Husbands</HI> and <HI>Wives, Parents</HI> and <HI>Children,</HI> and other <HI>Relatives;</HI> but also lays us under a Necessity of mutual Dependence one upon another, which obligeth us to enter into Compacts
<PB N="20" REF="006859_0153_102AAC3C7B897C50"/>
for our Defence and Safety, and for maintaining both private Right and publick Order, and pro∣moting the common Good of our Species, in the several Communities to which we belong. And as I have a quick Sense of what is right in others towards me as being what I am, and of my own Ease and Comfort, so I cannot divest myself of a Sense of what must, for the same Reason, be right in me towards others, and a Sense of Ten∣derness and Compassion for those that are in Mi∣sery, whereby I am strongly prompted to relieve them: And these Tendencies and Affections of <HI>the social Kind,</HI> are evidently planted in us for pro∣moting our social Happiness. And finally; as I cannot long enjoy myself in a State of Solitude, and have a strong Passion for Society; so I find, in Fact, that my true Interest and Enjoyment of myself, depends on the general Interest and good Order of the Community, and this, in Addition to those social Dispositions, strongly prompts me to the Love of my Country, and to be forward and active in whatever may promote the publick Weal. Such are my Abilities and Advantages, and such my Condition, Circumstances and Ten∣dencies, and those of the Kind to which I stand related.</P>
<P N="14">§ 14. But then, if I consider myself a little further, I find, after all, that at best I am attend∣ed with very great Limitations and Imperfections. I cannot subsist myself a Moment in Ease or Ex∣istence, nor add one Power or Faculty to those I have: And there are certain Bounds (small compared with what I can easily imagine) be∣yond which I cannot at all extend or exert them. My Sight and Hearing are very scanty; my Un∣derstanding is but small; my Conceptions are
<PB N="21" REF="006859_0154_102AAC408AE53EE0"/>
very feeble; my Memory is very brittle; my At∣tention is very weak; my Knowledge is very confused; my Will is very irresolute; my Power is very infirm, and my Activity can extend but to a very small Compass.</P>
<P N="15">§ 15. BUT, which is worse, I find (which is the general Complaint of every one more or less) that we are troubled with some unhappy Tendency or other, which seems to be founded in the Frame of our Nature; some idle, sensual Disposition; some importunate Appetite, or some untoward Pas∣sion, which it is very difficult to keep within rea∣sonable Bounds, and in Indulgence to which, it is much if we have not contracted some ill Ha∣bit or other, or, at least, been guilty of many grievous Miscarriages, for which our Reason and Consciences have sadly reproached us, and given us very great Uneasiness, and sometimes terrible Apprehensions and Forebodings of Vengeance to come, unless we repent and reform. And Multitudes, I observe, are miserable Slaves to these perverse Dispositions and Habits: Hence the sad Complaints of the Prevalence of Lust, Passion, Prejudice, Pride, Deceit, Oppression, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> much obtaining in the World, corrupting and byassing the Minds, perverting the Judg∣ments and Resolutions of Mankind, and leading them into many Errors and Vices, to the great Mischief and Confusion of Society, as well as the Ruin of particular Persons.</P>
<P N="16">§ 16. AT the same time we find, by sad Experience, that we are daily liable to many In∣firmities and Diseases, Pains and Miseries, Los∣ses and Disappointments, and perpetual Uncer∣tainty, with respect to Life and Health, and every Thing about us, and must expect, in a lit∣tle
<PB N="22" REF="006859_0155_102AAC4215275438"/>
Time to quit our present State of Being, and resign to the common Fate of a Dissolution, which is called <HI>Death,</HI> that King of Terrors, who is incessantly making his Approaches towards us in one Shape or other. Such a strange Mixture is human Nature! Such a various Creature is Man! Such his noble Abilities and Excellencies on the one Hand, and such his Imperfections and Wretchedness on the other.</P>

<P N="1">§ 1. (II.) I PROCEED now to the next Enquiry. Let every One then, in the <HI>second</HI> Place, seriously ask himself this Que∣stion, <HI>How came I to be, and to be such an imper∣fect and sinful Being as I am?</HI> For we cannot have a right Knowledge of ourselves, without considering, not only what we are in ourselves, but also how we stand variously related, and par∣ticularly, without looking to the Cause of our present Being and Limitations (<HI>Introd.</HI> 26.) and in order to answer this Question, let us consider and reason with ourselves in the following Manner.</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. I KNOW that I have a Being, because I perceive and act, and that I must have had a Beginning of Existence, because there must have been a Time when I did not perceive or act, and
<PB N="23" REF="006859_0156_102AAC43A8CE78E0"/>
I can have no Notion of the Existence of an intel∣ligent active Being, without conscious Perception and Activity. And if I began to be, I must have been made. It is certain I could not come into Being by meer <HI>Chance,</HI> for that is nothing but an empty Name, which we vulgarly use only as a Cover to our Ignorance or Inadvertence. I also know I did not make myself, for that is im∣possible, and would imply, to be, and not to be, at the same Time; nor have I Power to con∣tinue myself in Being so much as one Moment; nor can I a Moment secure my Health, or any of my Enjoyments (Part I. Chap. I. § 14.) so that I find I am wholly a limited and dependent Being.</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. IT is therefore certain, that I must have had a Cause; for an Effect, or Thing made, with∣out a Cause, is a Contradiction, and can have no Meaning: There must then be some other Being on whom I depend. And since <HI>there cannot be an Effect without a Cause,</HI> it is evident that the Cause of my Being must have Powers capable of pro∣ducing such an Effect; otherwise there would still be an Effect without a Cause, than which nothing can be more absurd. It is evident that my Pa∣rents could not be the adequate Causes; they could, at most, be only the Occasions or Instru∣ments of my Being; for it never was in their Power that I should be at all, or being, that I should be such as I am; nor could they continue me a Moment in Being, Health or Ease. It is therefore plain that I must look higher for an adequate Cause, both of my Existence and Sub∣sistence.</P>
<P N="4">§ 4. IT is moreover manifest, that <HI>no Cause can give what it hath not,</HI> or, which is the same Thing, produce an Effect more noble, or of
<PB N="24" REF="006859_0157_102AAC46213918B0"/>
greater Powers or Perfections than itself; for then again, there would be an Effect without a Cause, or Something produced by Nothing, which is impossible. Hence, therefore, it is plain, that what is destitute of Perception, Consciousness and Intelligence, cannot produce a perceptive, con∣scious, intelligent Being: What is void of any Principle of Deliberation, Liberty and Activity, cannot produce a considerate, free, active Being, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It is consequently evident, that the Being who brought me into Being, must himself be possessed of Powers or Perfections analogous to those I experience in myself.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. SINCE, therefore, I know I have some considerable Degrees of Understanding, Know∣ledge, Will, Force and Activity, with Freedom of Deliberation, Choice and Design, and the Powers of Self-exertion, and Self-determination, together with some Sense of Benevolence, and of Right and Wrong, or Equity and Iniquity, and some Disposition to do the one, and avoid the other (Chap. I. § 5, 6.) It is from hence evident, that the Almighty Being, who made me, and whom I call GOD, being the genuine and ade∣quate Cause, from whom I derived, and on whom I depend, must Himself have <HI>Understand∣ing, Knowledge, Will, Force,</HI> and <HI>Activity;</HI> must have <HI>Liberty, Choice, Deliberation, Self-exertion,</HI> and <HI>Self-determination;</HI> and must be a Being of <HI>Equity, Justice</HI> and <HI>Goodness,</HI> and all other moral Perfections, which are implied in these, and which are comprehended under the Terms <HI>Holiness</HI> and <HI>Rectitude.</HI> And as I am thus truly made by Him, and in some Measure to resemble Him, He must therefore be strictly and properly my <HI>Pa∣rent,</HI> or the <HI>Father of my Spirit.</HI></P>

NOW what I thus argue from myself to the Cause of my Existence, must be equally true of every other intelligent active Being, that knows he must have had a Beginning of Ex∣istence, and is limited and dependent, however so perfect, as well as of me. From whence it is evident, that this universal Cause must be possessed of the highest Perfections and Powers that are conceivable, or do at all obtain, and that he must hold them entirely independent of any other Being whatsoever: And, being independent of any other Being, it is evident, that He cannot be under the Power of any other Being to limit or controul Him, and that all other Beings must be entirely dependent upon Him, and consequently must have derived from his Will and Power, and there∣fore be limited to various Degrees of Being and Perfection, as pleaseth Him. So that He must hold, possess and enjoy <HI>all possible Perfection</HI> in and of Himself, without any possible <HI>Limitation</HI> or <HI>Im∣perfection,</HI> and must be the universal <HI>Father of Spirits,</HI> and was accordingly by the wisest of the Ancients, stiled, <HI>The Father of the Universe.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Clarke</HI>'s and <HI>Burnet</HI>'s <HI>Boyle</HI>'s <HI>Lectures.</HI></NOTE> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>&amp;c.

<P N="7">§ 7. SINCE, therefore, he thus exists, inde∣pendent of all other Beings, and they, by the Necessity of their Nature, derive from Him, and depend on Him, it is plain that he must exist originally by the absolute Necessity of his Nature without any Cause, and consequently be <HI>All in All,</HI> All that truly <HI>is,</HI> All Perfection and Fulness of Being, or <HI>Being</HI> and Perfection, by way of Eminency, and so He alone must be the <HI>necessa∣rily existent Being,</HI> or that Being, to whom it is
<PB N="26" REF="006859_0159_102AAC4C6C65B518"/>
peculiar that <HI>Existence</HI> is necessarily implied in his very <HI>Essence.</HI> Hence He was, by the wisest of the Ancients, called the ΤΟ ΟΝ, and the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, or <HI>the Being who truly exists;</HI> and hence the Name <HI>JEHOVAH,</HI> by which He thought fit, from the Beginning, to be called, in Contradi∣stinction to all precarious and dependent Beings, signifies, <HI>The Essence existing,</HI> or the Being whose Essence implieth Existence, and whose Existence is ever present, without any Limitation to Time or Place.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Hutchinson</HI>'s <HI>Moses Sine Principio.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="8">§ 8. NOR can there be more than <HI>One</HI> such Being, because it is thus evident that He alone can <HI>necessarily exist,</HI> and that <HI>all possible Perfections</HI> are united in Him, or <HI>One</HI> in Him; it being a Contradiction, that two or more Beings should each have all possible Perfection. And since He must thus have such an absolute Fulness of Being, He is on that Account said to be <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Good,</HI> by way of Eminency: He is <HI>Truth,</HI> as in Him there is all Reality, and <HI>Good,</HI> as in Him there is all Excellency, even every Thing that can contri∣bute to render both Himself and all His Creatures entirely happy; and He is called <HI>Truth,</HI> as He is intelligible; and <HI>Good,</HI> as He is eligible. He must therefore be the Source of all <HI>Happiness,</HI> both with regard to the <HI>Intellect, Will, Affections</HI> and <HI>Activity.</HI></P>
<P N="9">§ 9. IN this Method of Reasoning it is evi∣dent, that the great Cause or Author of my Being and Powers, and those of all other Spirits, or intelligent active Beings, must necessarily be <HI>Infinite, Eternal</HI> and <HI>Unchangeable.</HI> For if He be out of the Power of every other Being to li∣mit or controul Him, his Knowledge, Power and Activity, cannot be confined to any particular
<PB N="27" REF="006859_0160_102AAC4DF391F720"/>
Object, in any Point of Space or Duration, since all Being, Time and Place, depend on Him, nor can He be liable to any Change from any Power whatsoever, since all Powers derive from Him. So that, as there never was a Time when He could have begun to be, so it is impossible he should ever cease to be, or be altered from what he is. And for the same Reason that he cannot but be present here or there, or to every particu∣lar Person or Thing, in any assignable Place or Point of Space, he cannot but be every where else, or <HI>Omnipresent,</HI> since all Existence perpetu∣ally depends on Him. And hence it is plain, that all Things past, present, or to come, in all Parts of the Universe, must at once be present to Him, as being perfectly known to Him, and subject to Him, as being intirely dependent on his Almighty Will and Power.</P>
<P N="10">§ 10. NOR can I doubt of the Existence of such a <HI>necessary and eternal</HI> Being, from the Ex∣istence of <HI>necessary and eternal Truth.</HI> There are a great Number of evident Truths that come within our Reach, which I find exist necessarily and eternally independent of my Mind, or any other created Mind whatsoever, by the Light and Evidence of many of which (to which I find my Mind is passive) I am enabled to judge of True and False, and of Right and Wrong, in every particular Case: Such as these, <HI>Action implies Ex∣istence; an Effect must suppose a Cause;</HI> the Whole <HI>is bigger than either of its Parts; Things equal to another are equal among themselves; what is Right or Wrong in another towards me, must be equally Right or Wrong in me towards him,</HI> &amp;c. Now, these and the like Truths imply the necessary Ha∣bitudes of certain Essences that do not depend on any particular Existences in Nature, and must
<PB N="28" REF="006859_0161_102AAC5084565618"/>
therefore have an antecedent mental or intel∣lectual Existence; and there can be no Concep∣tion of Truth without a Mind perceiving it, or in which it exists. Since, therefore, there are eter∣nal Truths necessarily existing, independent of any created Mind, or any Thing existing in Na∣ture, it is evident there must be an eternal, neces∣sarily existing, independent Mind, in which they originally exist, as one eternal Light of Truth, and by whom they are exhibited to all other Minds in various Measures, according to their several Capacities and Application, enabling them to judge of every particular Thing that comes within their Notice. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Norris</HI>'s Ideal World and Miscellanies, and <HI>Cam∣bray</HI>'s Demonstration.</NOTE> He is therefore the great <HI>Parent Mind,</HI> from whom derives all Light and Knowledge to every created Intelligence, being, as it were, the intellectual Sun enlightening our Minds, as the sensible Sun, by his incessant Acti∣vity, enlighteneth our Eyes.</P>
<P N="11">§ 11. WHAT I have thus argued from my own Existence, Powers and Faculties, and those of every other intelligent and active Creature, and from the Existence of eternal Truth, may be also demonstrated from the Existence of every sensible Thing that I see, hear and feel, from without me. I know that I am not the Cause of any of those Impressions that are made upon my Senses; Light, Colours, Sounds, tan∣gible Qualities, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I am sure they do not de∣pend upon my Will and Activity; for I am in∣tirely passive in the Reception of them. Nor can they be without a Cause, nor yet from any senseless, inert or unactive Cause, for that is a Contradiction in Terms. They must therefore
<PB N="29" REF="006859_0162_102AAC52EB85D498"/>
be the constant Effects of an intelligent Cause, in∣timately present with me, and incessantly active upon me, who continually produceth all these Sensations in my Mind, correspondent to the Archetypes in his all-comprehending Intellect, ac∣cording to certain stable Laws, or fixed Rules, which He hath established to Himself, and which are commonly called the Laws of Nature. When therefore I consider the whole System of these sensible, as well as the intelligible, Objects that surround me, and under the Impression of which I continually live, I must conclude, that <HI>I live, and move, and have my Being,</HI> in Him, who is the perpetual and <HI>Almighty</HI> Author of them. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Bishop <HI>Berkeley</HI>'s Dialogues, Pages 78, 79, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P N="12">§ 12. I FIND these sensible Objects are all firmly connected together, Things visible with Things tangible, and all the various Combina∣tions of them one with another, so as to consti∣tute one most beautiful and useful Whole, which we call the <HI>natural World;</HI> in all which I do manifestly discern the most wise Design, and the most exquisite Contrivance and Adjustment of Ends and Means (Chap. I. § 10.) from whence I gather, that they must be the Effects of a most wise and designing Cause. And I do evidently experience that they are all contrived in the best Manner to render them subservient to all the Pur∣poses of my Subsistence and Well-being, and that of the whole rational and moral System, which we call the <HI>Moral World;</HI> from whence I must conclude the glorious Author of them to be, not only an infinitely <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>powerful,</HI> but moreover an infinitely <HI>kind</HI> and <HI>benevolent</HI> Being.</P>
<P N="13">§ 13. I DO not, indeed, find, upon a close Examination, that there is any necessary Connec∣tion

between them; for Instance, between the Objects of <HI>Sight</HI> and <HI>Feeling;</HI> the one appears to have only the Nature of a Sign with Regard to the other, being all alike, meer passive Percep∣tions in our Minds, between which there can be no Relation of Causality: So that the Connection between them, tho' stable, is entirely arbitrary; as is that between the Sound, <HI>Man,</HI> and the Thing signified by it: From whence I gather, that I must unavoidably consider the one with regard to the other, to have the Nature of a wonderful Language, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Minute Philosopher,</HI> Dial. 4.</NOTE> whereby the great Author of Na∣ture appears to be continually present with me, discovering his Mind and Will to me (and that in a stable and invariable Manner, which I find I can always depend upon) and, as it were, speaking to me, and directing me how to act, and conduct myself in all the Affairs of Life; whereby he manifestly discovereth a constant watchful <HI>Providence</HI> over me in all my Ways. From whence it is evident, not only that He is, but that He must be, both a Being of infinite <HI>Goodness, Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> and of the most stable <HI>Truth,</HI> and invariable <HI>Integrity.</HI></P>
<P N="14">§ 14. I DO moreover see and feel a vast Variety of <HI>Motions,</HI> on the Laws of which, most wisely contrived, dependeth the whole Order, Harmo∣ny and Usefulness of the natural World.

<PB N="31" REF="006859_0164_102AAC58CAC62208"/>
of Nature, as well as all other Objects of Sense, both in the Heavens above, and in the Earth be∣low, we constantly see and feel the universal Pre∣sence of that most <HI>wisely designing,</HI> and most <HI>powerfully active, all-comprehending Mind,</HI> who both begins and continues Motion, and is there∣fore the <HI>Almighty Author</HI> and <HI>Preserver</HI> of all Things.</P>

Not the Spirit or Soul, which is properly the Person, and which, in the Nature of it, cannot be an Object of Sense; I see only the Shape and Colour of a Man, cloathed with gorgeous Robes. In like Manner, I cannot see GOD, as He is a Spirit, and, as such, is invi∣sible; but I as truly see Him, as I see a Man like myself; nay, indeed, more manifestly than I can behold any mortal Man; for I see Him in every visible Shape and Form in all Nature; I be∣hold Him in all the infinitely various Modifications of <HI>Light</HI> and Colours throughout the whole Crea∣tion; in ail which, He is every where present, being, as it were, <HI>cloathed with Light, as with a Garment;</HI> which Expression is rightly observed to be of like Import with that Saying of the ancient Eastern Sages, That <HI>GOD hath Light for his Body, and Truth for his Soul.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Minute Philosopher,</HI> Dial. 4. § 5, and 15.</NOTE> In the same Manner, I may truly say, I feel Him in the <HI>Heat</HI> and Wind, and in every tangible Figure and Mo∣tion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I hear Him in every Sound, and taste Him in every Morsel, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> In a Word, I must again say, it is He who is <HI>All in All.</HI></P>
<P N="16"><PB N="32" REF="006859_0165_102AAC5C6CCFA248"/>§ 16. FURTHERMORE (not to descend to that infinite World of minute Creatures, which the Microscope opens to our View, and which gives us surprising Apprehensions of the DEITY) as I observe all these sensible Objects about me, are connected together, in a wonderful Manner, in∣to one most beautiful and useful System, and made subservient to my Subsistence and Well-being, and those of my Species, in this Mansion allotted to us; so I observe this Globe, on which we live, to be no less wonderfully connected with the <HI>Sun</HI> and other <HI>Planets,</HI> with us surrounding and de∣pending on him, so that they all make one entire System; the other Globes being probably design'd for Uses analagous to this of ours. And as the pro∣digious Number of <HI>fixed Stars</HI> seem to be of the same Nature, so it is probable they are designed for the like Purposes with those for which I find our <HI>Sun,</HI> the great Source of <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> to us, is manifestly fitted and designed, and consequently may have Globes like ours, depending on them. If so, as this gives me a stupendous Idea of the vast Extent and Variety of the mighty Works of GOD, so it must give me astonishing Ap∣prehensions of His excellent <HI>Greatness, Majesty</HI> and <HI>Glory,</HI> who must be equally present with them all, and does alike display his infinite <HI>Wisdom, Power</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> in them, to all the admiring Beholders; having His whole vast <HI>Family of Hea∣ven and Earth,</HI> alike depending upon Him, and deriving their All from Him, <HI>in all Places of His Dominion.</HI></P>
<P N="17">§ 17. WHAT is thus evident to me from the <HI>Frame and Constitution</HI> of the <HI>natural World,</HI> is no less evident from the <HI>Constitution</HI> of the <HI>moral World.</HI> For, as I see all the <HI>Order, Harmony</HI> and
<PB N="33" REF="006859_0166_102AAC5DF40B45D0"/>
<HI>Usefulness</HI> of Nature depends on the Laws of (what is called) <HI>Attraction,</HI> by which the vast Globes keep their Situations, and proceed inces∣santly in their perpetual Rounds, and all the Parts and Appendages of each Globe are firmly kept together; and also on the surprizing <HI>Instincts</HI> by which the several Tribes of Animals are led to provide for their Subsistence, and the Continu∣ance of their Species, which can no otherwise be accounted for, than from the meer passive Im∣pressions of the great Almighty Mind, that sub∣sists and governs the World in the best and wisest Manner: So I observe all the Order, Harmony and Happiness of the <HI>moral World,</HI> depends on the Laws of <HI>Benevolence</HI> (Chap. I. § 13.) which taking its Rise in the natural Affection between the Sexes, Parents, Children, and other Relatives, spreads through the whole Species, strongly at∣taching them to social Life; which strong Ten∣dency of <HI>Benevolence</HI> in the <HI>moral World,</HI> is plainly analogous to <HI>Attraction</HI> and <HI>Instincts</HI> in the <HI>natu∣ral,</HI> and must accordingly be a like passive Im∣pression of the same great Parent-governing Mind, who plainly designs hereby to keep the moral World together, and in order; and by Him also it is manifest, that all created Minds are passively enlightened, to have a quick Sense, and intuitive Evidence of the Fit, the Fair, and Decent in Beha∣viour (<HI>Introd.</HI> 15. And Chap. II. § 10.) and thence, the Laws by which this Principle of Bene∣volence must be regulated, in order to their uni∣versal Harmony and Happiness. From hence, therefore, also evidently appears, not only His <HI>Existence, Onmipresence,</HI> and infinite <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Power,</HI> but also his infinite <HI>Benevolence</HI> and <HI>Equity.</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="006859_0167_102AAC6110503560"/>
befitting the Character of Him, who is the great <HI>Father</HI> and <HI>Lord of the Universe.</HI></P>
<P N="18">§ 18. NOW it being evident from all that hath been said, that this glorious Being, whom I call my GOD, must be a Being of all possible Per∣fection; it is plain that He must have an intire and absolute <HI>Sufficiency</HI> in and of Himself to His own Happiness, and therefore cannot need any of His Creatures, or any Thing they can do to make Him happy, nor can any Thing they can do, make Him otherwise. And from His abso∣lute <HI>Independency,</HI> and their continual and intire Dependence upon His Will and Power (§ 6.) I must conclude, that He is not only the <HI>Al∣mighty Creator</HI> and <HI>most high Possessor</HI> of <HI>Heaven and Earth,</HI> and of every Creature therein; but, moreover, that He is the continual <HI>Preserver</HI> of all His Creatures, and consequently, that the Moment He should cease to will the Continuance of their Existence, they must unavoidably cease, and drop into nothing.</P>
<P N="19">§ 19. NOR can it, I think, be conceived, that the infinitely wise, powerful, just and good Author of my Being, and of all other intelligent active Creatures, would neglect us, and take no further Care of us. I cannot imagine, from His Attributes above demonstrated, but that He must look after each of His Creatures, and see what use we make of the Being, Powers and Advan∣tages He hath given us, and take Care to instruct and conduct us to the End He designed, and that in a Manner suitable to the Nature and Pow∣ers which He hath given us (Chap. I. § 2, 5.) It cannot therefore be, but that, as he evidently governs the <HI>natural World,</HI> in a passive Manner, suitable to its passive Nature, by the Laws which
<PB N="35" REF="006859_0168_102AAC6299EDF468"/>
He hath established to Himself (being Himself, properly speaking, the sole Agent) so He must much more govern the <HI>moral World</HI> (as being in itself of vastly the greatest Worth, and the End of the other) in a Manner suitable to its rational and moral Nature, to whom He hath given to be a System of intelligent, conscious, free Agents, and consequently capable of <HI>moral Government,</HI> by Laws and Motives, suggested to their Reason and Consciences, and to their Hopes and Fears: And consequently I cannot doubt but I am sub∣ject to His Conduct and Government, and that he will thus govern me as a reasonable and mo∣ral Agent; and that, in Consequence of this, He will call me to an Account, and see how I shall have conducted myself in this State of Probation, in the Use of the Abilities and Talents which he hath committed to my Trust, and judge whe∣ther I have endeavoured to answer the End of my Being, in Conformity to the Laws of that reasonable and Self-active Nature, which he hath given me, and make me fare well or ill, accord∣ing as my Behaviour shall be found to have been good or bad. That this is fit and reasonable to be expected, my own Conscience strongly suggests (Chap. I. § 11, 15.) and that Happiness or Mise∣ry, will be the Effect of Virtue or Vice, the Na∣ture of the Things themselves loudly proclaims (it being a no less evident Law of Nature in Morals, than in Naturals, That <HI>whatsoever a Man soweth, that shall he also reap.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Turnbull,</HI> Vol. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>) Nor can it be doubted but that He, who is Holiness and Righteousness it∣self, cannot but love those Qualities wherever He beholds them, and must therefore be engaged to make them happy; nor can His Justice fail to
<PB N="36" REF="006859_0169_102AAC64282A8C08"/>
make the contrary miserable. So that as sure as He is <HI>just</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> so sure He will <HI>reward</HI> the one, and <HI>punish</HI> the other. And what is thus reasonable to think with regard to myself, must be equally true with regard to all other intelligent Creatures. GOD must therefore be, not only the <HI>Almighty Creator</HI> and <HI>Preserver,</HI> but also the <HI>supreme Ruler,</HI> and <HI>moral Governor</HI> of the World; the great <HI>King, Lord</HI> and <HI>Judge</HI> of the whole Universe, which therefore is His <HI>Kingdom,</HI> in which He most wisely and uncontroulably pre∣sides, and orders all Things for the Good of the Whole, in a Manner suitable to the best Interest of each Nature. I cannot therefore doubt but that He will in the Whole and Result of Things, bring Good out of Evil, and make Evil itself subservient to Good, and even over-rule the Sins and Follies of His Creatures, so as finally to an∣swer the best Ends.</P>
<P N="20">§ 20. IF now it be enquired, <HI>How I came to be such an imperfect, frail, sinful Being, as I am?</HI> Or how it could be, that the wise and good GOD that made me, who is Himself the most perfect and best of Beings, should make me such an im∣perfect, sinful and miserable Creature, as I find myself to be? (Chap. I. § 15.) To this I must answer in the following Manner: That GOD should make me such an imperfect (or less per∣fect) Creature as I am, compared with others, or with what I can easily imagine, I see no Reason to doubt; inasmuch as my Being itself, and eve∣ry Perfection of it, and Advantage attending it, must be His sovereign free Gift, and what He was in no wise obliged to bestow. He is the sovereign Lord of His Favours, and must there∣fore be intirely at Liberty to bestow such De∣grees
<PB N="37" REF="006859_0170_102AAC685FB35370"/>
of Being and Perfection, and such Advan∣tages, greater or less, as He thinks fit; and it appears that He hath delighted in a boundless Variety in all His Works.</P>
<P N="21">§ 21. INDEED that He should, without any known voluntary Fault of mine, put me into a Condition that is, in the Whole, worse than not to be; or that He should, in giving me my Be∣ing, lay me under an absolute Necessity of being finally sinful and miserable; this would be a very hard Case indeed: But this I must think utterly impossible, as being what I cannot think con∣sistent with His Wisdom, Holiness, Justice and Goodness, above demonstrated. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Wollast. R. N.</HI> Page 200.</NOTE> But so long as I have such a Being as is desirable, tho' attended with great Frailties, Limitations and Imperfec∣tions, and am put into such a Condition as ren∣ders me capable of further Improvements, and of attaining to some good Degree of Happiness, if I am not wanting to myself, and since I shall not be obliged to account for any more than I have re∣ceived; I cannot reasonably complain, but ought to be very thankful for it, tho' I see others have much greater Advantages than I, from whom, in all Reason, a proportionably greater Account will be expected.</P>
<P N="22">§ 22. AND as to my being so <HI>sinful</HI> a Crea∣ture as I must confess I am, this I cannot a∣scribe to GOD; for since the formal Notion of <HI>Sin</HI> consists in the voluntary Opposition of our Wills to the known Will of GOD, or the Con∣stitution which He hath made, it must be the Fault of my Will, and not of His; and accord∣ingly my own Conscience tells me, whenever I do amiss, that I myself (and not He) am the
<PB N="38" REF="006859_0171_102AAC6AB16631C8"/>
Cause, and true Author of all the Wickedness I commit. If, therefore, instead of being obedient to the Author of my Being, and making a good Use of my Liberty, and of the Powers and Ad∣vantages He hath given me, and thereby further improving them, and qualifying myself for the Happiness He designs for me in so doing, I make a bad Use of them, by voluntarily acting con∣trary to His known Will, and thereby sink my∣self into a worse Condition; nay, tho' it were into a worse Condition than not to be, it is wholly owing to myself, and not to Him that made me.</P>
<P N="23">§ 23. IF now I should ask, Why hath GOD made me at all peccable, or capable of Sin? This would be the same as to ask, Why hath He made me capable of Duty? Or, why hath He made me a free Agent? But this would be a strange Question; for without Liberty I should be destitute of one of the chief Excellencies of my rational Nature, and should not be capable of either Duty or Sin, properly speaking; for as Sin consists in a free and voluntary Disobedience, so Duty consists in a free and willing Obedience to the known Will of GOD. So that without a Power of Liberty or free Agency, there could have been no such Thing as either Virtue or Vice, Praise or Blame; nor can either the one or the other obtain, but in Proportion to the Know∣ledge we have, or may have, of what we ought to do, and the Powers we are furnished with, either to do or forbear. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Wollast. R. N.</HI> Page 62.</NOTE></P>
<P N="24">§ 24. AND, lastly, as to the many Pains, Ca∣lamities and Dissolution, to which I am liable (Chap. I. § 16.) I must think, that as I am a Sinner, I need a Course of Discipline: That it is
<PB N="39" REF="006859_0172_102AAC6E32388588"/>
fit natural Evil should attend moral Evil, as the best Means for the Cure of it: And that there∣fore GOD, having it in View that we would abuse our Liberty, not only justly, but wisely and kindly ordered these Calamities, as being the fit∣test Means that could have been used to bring us to Repentance and Reformation, and to discipline us to Virtue, by mortifying our Lusts, and dis∣engaging us from those Objects that are most apt to ensnare and mislead us; and, at the same time, they give us Occasion and Opportunity for the Exercise of several Virtues of very great Use to∣wards the perfecting our reasonable and active Nature, which otherwise could have had no Place; and since we cannot, as Things now are, be com∣pletely happy here, they lead us to the Hopes of a better State hereafter.</P>
<P N="25">§ 25. THUS it appears to me, that, without any Imputation upon either the Wisdom, Power, Justice or Goodness of GOD, we may sufficient∣ly account for all the Sin and Calamity that ob∣tain in the World. But if, after all, there should be some untoward Appearances in the Conduct of Providence that we cannot clearly account for, they ought not to be admitted as any just Objec∣tions against what hath been antecedently demon∣strated; especially since we should be very vain in∣deed, to think ourselves qualified to be compe∣tent Judges of <HI>the deep Things of GOD.</HI> We see but a small Part, a very short Scene of the vast <HI>Drama,</HI> and therefore are not able to make any tolerable Judgment of the Whole: So that what to us may have the Appearance of Evil, may, in the whole, have the Nature of Good; and it becometh us, for that Reason, to have an implicit Faith in the infinite Wisdom, Power,
<PB N="40" REF="006859_0173_102AAC70B74F5510"/>
Justice and Goodness of the Deity, above de∣monstrated, that it will prove so in the Whole and Result of Things. And that this Expectation may appear the more reasonable, I proceed now to the next Enquiry.</P>

<P N="2">§ 2. THAT I was not made at all Adventures, without any Contrivance and Design, but must have been made for some End or other, I cannot doubt, since I have evidently found, that He who gave me my Being, must Himself be a Being of all possible Perfections, and consequently must be a most kind, wise and designing Cause; especially since I do also evidently find in Fact, so many, and such manifest Tokens of the wisest and most benevolent Design and Contrivance in my whole Frame, and in every Thing about me (Chap. I. § 2, 9, 10.)</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. BEING therefore made by a most wise and good Cause, I must necessarily have been made for some wise and good End. And having demonstrated that the Being who made me, hath
<PB N="41" REF="006859_0174_102AAC740859B200"/>
an infinite Sufficiency within Himself for His own Happiness, independent of any other Being (Chap. II. § 18.) it is manifest that whatever good End He had in giving me my Being, it could not be to serve Himself of me, or to promote any Ad∣vantage to Himself by me: This were a Thought infinitely too mean to entertain of Him, who is <HI>GOD, All-sufficient,</HI> that it could be possible for Him to stand in need of me, or of any Thing I could do or suffer, in order to His own Hap∣piness.</P>
<P N="4">§ 4. MOREOVER, since it hath been evidently discovered that the Author of my Being is infi∣nitely perfect, and consequently perfectly just and good; perfectly equitable and benevolent (Chap. II. § 6, 17.) it is evident that He could not give me my Being with any malevolent Design, or with a Design that I should be absolutely and un∣avoidably miserable in the Whole; nor could He (as I humbly conceive) design Misery for me, or any of His Creatures, but in Consequence of their personal, voluntary Demerit, by persisting in wilful Rebellion against Him, or the general Interest of the Constitution which He hath made; for this would be so far from consisting with E∣quity and Benevolence, that it would imply the very Notion of Cruelty. A Thought which we should remove at an infinite Distance from that most perfect and best of Beings.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. INDEED, in case of wilful Rebellion, fi∣nally persisted in, it is fit and right, and even ne∣cessary for the Good of the Whole (being the most effectual Means to cure Rebellion, and secure the Obedience of GOD's Creatures, which is ne∣cessary for their general Good and Happiness) that Punishment should be inflicted upon those
<PB N="42" REF="006859_0175_102AAC7642C94990"/>
that rebel, and obstinately oppose their Wills to the Constitution He hath made, and the Ends of His Government, in Proportion to their several Crimes and Misdemeanors (Chap. II. § 19.) And indeed Mischief and Misery do, in the Nature of Things, necessarily result from Sin and Vice. But it can∣not be therefore supposed that their Misery could be His primary Design, or that He should intend their Rebellion, or lay them under a Necessity of Sinning, that they might be finally miserable; for this would, in Effect, be absolutely to design their Misery, and delight in it as such, which to Him must be infinitely impossible.</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. ON the contrary, since GOD is evi∣dently a most kind and benevolent Being, and could therefore have no other than kind and benevolent Ends, in giving Being to His rational Creatures, it is plain that His primary Intention must have been so far from that of making them to be miserable, that He did undoubtedly make them with a Design that they might be, in some good Degree, happy, in the Participation and Enjoyment of His Goodness, in Proportion to their several Capacities and Qualifications. And that this was, in Fact, His End, is also manifest from the Frame and Structure of the Nature which He hath given them; for He hath given them Consciousness, whereby they are capable of Self-enjoyment; Intelligence, whereby they are able to consider and judge of what is fit and needful to the Enjoyment of themselves; Passions, whereby they are prompted to desire and endea∣vour what contributes to their Well-being, and to guard and defend themselves against what may be hurtful to them; and a Principle of Activity, to procure the one, and avoid the other; and of Liberty, whereby they are able to suspend Judg∣ing
<PB N="43" REF="006859_0176_102AAC77F34CC830"/>
and Acting, till they can duly ballance their Passions, and act with Advantage. And besides these Powers, which are Means to their personal Happiness, He hath also inspired them with so∣cial Affections, which render them capable of so∣cial Happiness: Having therefore given them the Means, it is plain He must have designed the End. (Chap. I. § 5, 7, 13.)</P>
<P N="7">§ 7. THIS then being the Frame of that Na∣ture, which GOD hath given us, it must plainly be His Design that we should seek our Happiness, in affecting and acting conformable to it; other∣wise, if we act inconsistent with ourselves, and so do a Violence to our own Nature; in this Case, we can neither enjoy ourselves, nor any Thing else, and so must be unavoidably miserable. In∣asmuch therefore as GOD hath made us to be intelligent, free, active Creatures; and since our Happiness must immediately depend upon the right Use of these Powers, and must consist in the free and vigorous Exertion of them, in Con∣formity to the great Law of our Nature, which is the inward Sense of our own Reason and Con∣sciences; it must accordingly be His Design, not only that we should be happy, but that we should be so by Means of our own Activity, and by our always freely acting reasonably, and consequently that we should cultivate and improve our Reason in the best Manner we can, under the Circumstances in which He hath placed us, in order to make a right Judgment how we ought to affect and act, and conduct ourselves to the best Advantage for our own Happiness.</P>
<P N="8">§ 8. IT may, indeed, be truly said, that <HI>GOD made all Things for His own Glory,</HI> if it be rightly understood. But wherein then doth His Glory consist? It is plain, it cannot consist in the Disor∣der,
<PB N="44" REF="006859_0177_102AAC7A1F94B780"/>
Confusion and Misery, of His Creatures; nor can it consist meerly in being applauded by them. It is, indeed, fit and right in itself, and for our Good, as well as His Honour, and there∣fore He requireth it, that we should daily ac∣knowledge Him to be what He is, our Creator, Preserver and Benefactor; and all that is fit and right, fair and decent, true and good, must, as such, be His Glory, as being in itself conforma∣ble to His infinitely perfect Intellect and Will, as well as beatifying to His Creatures▪ and accord∣ingly nothing can be of greater Use and Advan∣tage to us, than that we live under a deep and habitual Sense of this. But it would be a most un∣worthy Thought of Him, to imagine that he made us for the Sake of being applauded, or that He requireth even these just Acknowledgments for His own Sake, as though we, or our Services, could be any Advantage to Him. This would be to make Him a most selfish Being indeed; especially if we should imagine that He could aim at Applause or Glory, at the Expence of our unavoidable and endless Misery: This would be a most dishonourable and shocking Thought.</P>
<P N="9">§ 9. SO far from this, that I must conceive it to be the Glory of GOD to communicate His Perfections in various Degrees, so far as they are communicable, and to display His Goodness to His Creatures, and make them happy in the Par∣ticipation of it, in Proportion to their several Capacities, and this in Consequence of their act∣ing in Obedience to Him, and in Conformity to His Law, which is the Law of their Natures. For since He was pleased to give them their Be∣ing, it cannot be but that, as the tender Father of His own Off-spring, He will account it His In∣terest
<PB N="45" REF="006859_0178_102AAC7CE7641758"/>
and Glory to see them as happy as may be, consistent with the Interest of the whole Family (to which it is fit every Individual should resign) and take Pleasure in every Thing that contri∣butes to their Happiness, and abhor whatsoever is destructive to it, and inconsistent with it, as His greatest Dishonour.</P>
<P N="10">§ 10. FOR since He that wills the End, must will the Means necessary to that End, it is plain that since GOD wills our Happiness in the Whole, as our End, and his Glory, it must be his Will and Law concerning us, that we avoid every Thing that doth, in the Nature of it, tend to make us miserable, and that we do every Thing that doth, in the Nature of it, tend to make us happy (<HI>Introd.</HI> 23.) So that the Glo∣ry of GOD, and our Happiness, with the Means necessary to it, and his Dishonour, and our Misery, with the Means which tend to that, must necessarily be coincident, and come in Ef∣fect to one and the same Thing.</P>
<P N="11">§ 11. AND since it is evident, from Experi∣ence, that Sin and Vice doth, in the Nature of it, tend to make us miserable; being contrary to to all that is reasonable and right; contrary to the Attributes and Will of GOD; contrary to the clear Sense of our own Minds, and to all the Interests of Society; and must therefore do a perpetual Violence to our reasonable and social Nature; and consequently be most odious in the Sight of GOD, and all intelligent Beings, as being unavoidably attended with Horror and Confusion, both personal and social: And since, on the other Hand, it is no less evident, that a virtuous and dutiful Temper and Behaviour, doth, in the Nature of it, tend to our Happi∣ness,
<PB N="46" REF="006859_0179_102AAC7E6EA87158"/>
because it consisteth in doing all that is reasonable and right, all that is agreeable to the Attributes and Will of GOD, to the Sense of our own Minds, and to all the Interests of So∣ciety, and therefore must necessarily approve it∣self, as most beautiful and amiable in the Sight of GOD, and all reasonable Beings, as being at∣tended with universal Harmony, Peace and Joy, both within and without, with regard both to GOD and Man; it is hence evident, that GOD's Glory must consist in our pursuing our own Hap∣piness, by avoiding the one, and doing the other.</P>
<P N="12">§ 12. BUT now to return: Since I am con∣vinced, from the above Method of Reasoning, that my Well-being and Happiness must have been GOD's End in giving me my Being, and that it must be a Happiness suitable to that Na∣ture which He hath given me, in the Whole of it; I must be persuaded, that since, besides an animal and sensitive, He hath moreover given me a rational, active and social Nature, as my superior and peculiar Character (Chap. I. § 5.) it is plain He must have designed men not meerly for a sensual and animal, but chiefly for a rational, ac∣tive and social Happiness.</P>
<P N="13">§ 13. IT cannot therefore be supposed an End worthy of GOD, and agreeable to the Na∣ture He hath given me, in the Whole of it, that I should have been brought into Being, only to eat and drink, and sleep, and enjoy the empty Gratifications of the animal Life, and that my Reason, and other superior Powers, should be designed only to be subservient to these inferior Pleasures (and in Effect only to render me more a Beast than I should have been without them) and that after a few Days spent in these low, grovelling Pursuits and Enjoyments, I should
<PB N="47" REF="006859_0180_102AAC809EC968A0"/>
then be utterly extinct, cease, and be no more. These short lived animal Enjoyments are indeed Ends suitable to the Nature of a meer Beast, and for which he is better qualified than I am: But if these could be supposed all the Ends that I was made for, the noble Powers of Reason, Reflec∣tion, Self-exertion and Self-determination, must have been given me in vain; nay, indeed to the worst Purposes, as they only serve to make me more exquisitely sensual, and, at the same time, sensible of my Wretchedness.</P>
<P N="14">§ 14. AT least this is certain, that these no∣ble Powers render me capable of a vastly high∣er End, and nobler Happiness, and which cannot attain to its Perfection here: For when I consi∣der the wretched Circumstances of my Condi∣tion in this Life, it is plain that such a Happiness can be but a little While, and but very imperfectly enjoyed, in this present, short, uncertain and uneasy State, amidst so many Sins and Follies, Embarrasments and Perplexities, as I am, at best, unavoidably attended with, while in this Body. Since therefore I am evidently made for such an Happiness, and that it cannot attain to any tole∣rable Degree of Perfection here, I must con∣clude that my Existence shall undoubtedly reach beyond this short and uncertain Life, and extend forward to endless Ages. Without this Conclu∣sion, I cannot see how I shall ever attain to any End worthy of the Wisdom and Goodness of the GOD that made me, and suitable to the superi∣or Nature and Powers which he hath given me, and the superior Happiness I am evidently capa∣ble of.</P>
<P N="15">§ 15. AND that I may live on, notwithstand∣ing what is vulgarly called <HI>Death,</HI> and am of a
<PB N="48" REF="006859_0181_102AAC82318F9770"/>
Nature capable of proceeding on to a nobler and more perfect Kind of Life, I cannot doubt, when I consider the vastly different Natures of Spirit and Body, of which I consist (the one in itself perceptive, conscious and Self-active, the other of itself meerly senseless, inert and passive) so in∣tirely different, that I cannot conceive of any Thing common to them, besides bare Existence, or of any natural or necessary Connection between them: I can conceive of no other than a meer arbitrary Connection, depending only on the Laws of their Union, which, in Natures so different, can, I think, be no other than the meer arbitrary Will of the Deity, and His perpetual <HI>Fiat.</HI> The Soul, therefore, being of a Nature intirely diffe∣rent from that of the Body, cannot be capable of any corporeal Laws and Affections, and conse∣quently cannot be liable to any such Change or Dissolution as Bodies are; <HI>i. e.</HI> being a perceptive, active, simple, unextended, indivisible Substance, it must be naturally indiscerpible, and consequent∣ly incorruptible. I cannot therefore imagine how the Dissolution of the Body should affect the Existence of the Soul, any more than the putting off an old Garment, to put on a new One, should affect the Existence of the Body. So that I cannot consider my Body as being <HI>my∣self,</HI> or, indeed, as being properly any Part of <HI>myself;</HI> my Soul or Mind, that intelligent active Principle, and that only, being properly <HI>myself;</HI> and my Body I can only consider as a Machine to which I am at present confined, and an Engine or Organ which I am obliged to make use of, in my various Perceptions and Exertions, <HI>ad extra.</HI> (Chap.

INASMUCH, therefore, as I am a Spi∣rit of an incorruptible Nature, and know that I have Powers capable of the sublime and noble Pleasures of Contemplation and Virtue, which yet cannot, in any Measure, attain to their Perfec∣tion here, I must believe, that, if I am not want∣ing to myself, they shall attain to it hereafter. I can, indeed, with much Labour and Struggle, make some little Proficiency in them in my pre∣sent State: But when I have done so, and am capable and earnestly desirous of proceeding fur∣ther, must I cease, and be no more? Can it be thought that the tender <HI>Father of my Spirit,</HI> would, after all my Pains, drop me into No∣thing, and at once fustrate all my Hopes and Labours? Can there, in this Case, any wise and good Reasons be conceived for putting an End to my Being and my Hopes together?

<P N="17">§ 17. I DO moreover find within myself a Fore-boding of something to come after this Life, which I cannot get rid of, and an eager Appetite and earnest Aspiration after Immortali∣ty, that I may be capable of an endless Enjoy∣ment of those noble and immortal Pleasures, which I cannot disengage myself from; nor can I think any One, capable of serious Consideration, can be disengaged from these Views, at least till he has contracted so much Guilt as to wish he may go out of Being, and is so immersed in Sen∣suality, as to have lost Sight of them, and be to∣tally disaffected to them, so as to become a meer

Brute of the worst Sort, a Kind of rational Brute, and so a Monster. Now I do not find any na∣tural Appetite, as this evidently is (Chap. I. § 8.) no, not of the meanest Kind, nor in the most despicable Creature, but that GOD hath pro∣vided a suitable Object correspondent to it; can it then be imagined that he would create such a noble Appetite in so noble a Creature as Man, and have provided no Object suitable and cor∣respondent to that? It cannot be.</P>
<P N="18">§ 18. THIS Reasoning is abundantly confirm∣ed to be right, when I consider further, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See this Argument finished in the best Manner by Mr. <HI>Wollaston,</HI> in <HI>Rel. N.</HI> Pages 200, 210.</NOTE> that in my present Situation, a long and laborious Course of stedfast Persisting in the Cause of Truth and Virtue, in spite of the strongest Solicitations to the contrary, is in this World many Times con∣temned, disregarded, derided, and even bar∣barously treated and oppressed, without any Re∣dress, and persecuted even to Death itself, and sometimes to the most barbarous Deaths; and that as long a Course of unrestrained Indulgence to the vilest and most mischievous Vices, is fre∣quently attended with uninterrupted Prosperity to the very last; I cannot therefore doubt, from the Wisdom, Power, Holiness, Justice and Good∣ness of GOD, but that the Time must come, when He will bring Good out of all this Evil, and these <HI>crooked Things shall be made straight;</HI> and that He who cannot but love Virtue, as being His own Likeness, will reward it, and make it, in the Whole, eventually happy, even above and beyond its natural Tendency: And that He who cannot but hate Vice, as being contrary to His Nature, will eventually punish it with due

Severity, and make it very miserable; which in∣deed it cannot but be in the Nature of the Thing itself. (Chap. II. § 19.)</P>
<P>§ 19. THE chief Difficulty that lies in the Way of this Persuasion of a future State, is the Inconceivableness of it: But this, I think, can be no reasonable Objection against it: For who, that had never seen any Thing but the universal Desolation and Death of a severe Winter, could conceive any Thing of the exquisite Beauties and admirable Productions of a fine Spring and Sum∣mer? Indeed I can no more conceive how my Soul is now united to my Body, and perceives and acts by Means of it, and by a meer Thought can move its unweildy Limbs at Pleasure, than I can conceive how it can exist, perceive and act, after what we call Death, without this gross tangible Machine, to which it is at present con∣fined. I can, however, a little assist my Imagi∣nation in forming some glimmering Notion of that future State, from this easy Supposition of a Man born blind and deaf, who, at the same time, hath the Senses of Feeling, Tasting and Smelling.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Guardian,</HI> No. 27.</NOTE> Now, to this Man, the tangible World, with the various Objects of Taste and Smell, is all the World that he can have any No∣tion of, any more than I can conceive of those <HI>Things which Eye hath not seen, nor Ear heard, nor have they enter'd into the Heart of Man to conceive.</HI> I, who have the visible World about me, and the Perception of various Sounds, am to this Man, what I may suppose Angels and other Spirits are to me: He can no more conceive of the visible World that I converse with, than I can conceive of the spiritual World, or the fu∣ture
<PB N="52" REF="006859_0185_102AAC8AE1D197C0"/>
State of my Being. Now, let me only con∣ceive this Man to be deprived of the Senses of Feeling, Tasting and Smelling, and he is dead, intirely dead, to all the World that he had ever any Notion of. But then imagine his Eyes and Ears to be opened, and to have this glorious Show of visible Objects, Light and Colours, with all their various Modifications, set before him, with a no less wonderful Variety of harmo∣nious Sounds; I must conceive him to have in∣tirely a new World open upon him, to which he was before an utter Stranger. He is indeed dead to the dark tangible World, but he hath exchanged it for a new visible World. Such a Change is very conceiveable; but it cannot be imagined that what we call Death can be a greater; nor can I believe it will be so great a Change, it be∣ing highly probable that Seeing, Hearing, and some necessary Instances of Feeling, are com∣mon to both our present and future State, and a Fund to begin with (together with our intellec∣tual and moral Accomplishments) when we enter upon that new Condition, wherein I can con∣ceive that other and more exquisite Senses may be added to these, and not only these Senses, but also our Understandings, Memory and Activity, may be advanced to a much greater Perfection than they had before. And inasmuch as our Happiness must imply Society and Intercourse with each other, and with the external World a∣bout us, it cannot be imagined but that we shall go off, and be always attended and connected with fine sensible Vehicles,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Wollaston, R.

<P>§ 20. FURTHERMORE, to add another Re∣semblance: I see here a Multitude of despicable Worms, confined to a slow Motion, and to a few low grovelling Sensations and Enjoyments, which, after a short Period of seeming Death, by a wonderful Transformation, turn into beautiful winged Animals, and waft themselves at Pleasure through the Air, and enjoy Pleasures they were before incapable of. Now may it not be reasonably thought, that these Creatures were designed to be Emblems of my own Case? I am here, like them, confined to a little Compass of Ground, and a few slow Motions, feeble Exertions, and low, and comparatively mean Enjoyments.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">For other Analogies, see Bishop <HI>Butler.</HI></NOTE> But if I shall have acted my Part well, in Pro∣portion to what Powers and Advantages I now enjoy, may I not reasonably hope, after my seeming Death, to pass into a new and glorious State, compared with which, my present Enjoy∣ments are, in a Manner, contemptible, and my present Life little better than a Dream? May I not hope, that when I am freed from this gross unweildy Body, and from my present Limitations and Confinements, and from all my Diseases, Sins and Temptations, to have my Powers greatly enlarged, and to be furnished with a pure aetherial Vehicle; and in that Capacity to shift the Scene at pleasure, and traverse through the vast Fields of <HI>Aether,</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Parte tamen meliore mei super alta perennis</L>

of GOD, and all His wondrous Works of Nature, Providence and Grace, in∣tirely devoted to the Obedience of His most righteous and reasonable Laws, and unspeakably happy in His Image and Favour.</P>
<P>§ 21. UPON the Whole, therefore, as I can∣not conceive how the true End of my Being, especially of that superior Nature, which is the peculiar Character of our Species, can be answer∣ed meerly by living this wretched, short and un∣certain Life, that is allotted to me here; so I must be persuaded, that I am designed for some other and nobler Condition of Being hereafter, and cannot avoid having <HI>Hopes full of Immortality.</HI> So that the only consistent Notion I can frame of this Life must be this, That as it is the first Stage of my Being, so it is designed only for a State of Childhood, Discipline and <HI>Probation,</HI> in order to another, and a better State, hereafter, which, in the Result, is to be a State of perfect Manhood and <HI>Retribution.</HI> And consequently, that in or∣der to qualify myself for that happy Condition, it must be my greatest Care, and the most im∣portant Business of my Life, while I continue here, to acquire, and improve myself in, all those Accomplishments, both of <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Virtue,</HI> and that both <HI>personal</HI> and <HI>social,</HI> wherein the Perfection and Happiness of my superior ra∣tional and immortal Nature consists; which alone I can carry with me into that <HI>future State;</HI> and which alone can enable me to enjoy myself, and my Friends, and, above all, my GOD, who is my supreme and sovereign Good, in whose Favour, with these Accomplishments, I cannot fail of being, in some good Degree, happy even here, and finally secure from all Evil, and in the Enjoyment of a
<PB N="55" REF="006859_0188_102AAC923ADB13E0"/>
vast, an unspeakable, and an endless Felicity! Thus it appears, that the true and ultimate End of my Being, can be nothing short of this; that I may be as happy as my Condition will admit of here, and eternally and completely happy in the future State of my Existence, in the Enjoyment of GOD, and all that is good, and in the Per∣fection of Knowledge and Virtue, which alone can render me capable thereof.</P>

that glorious Being, who is the Author and Pre∣server of them, to be freely engaged and active myself, in endeavouring to answer His End in the Bestowment of them, which, from the Na∣ture of my Being, I find is to be accomplished by Means of my own Activity (Part I.

And since I am ac∣countable to Him, for all the Powers and Ta∣lents He hath bestowed upon me, and must ex∣pect He will call me to Account for them, and see what Regard I have had to His End, in the Bestowment of them; it is necessary that I be, above all Things, concerned to act and conduct myself in such a Manner, as to be able to give a good Account of myself to Him.

And for the Resolution of this Enquiry, it will be needful to consider a little more parti∣cularly the End itself, which is GOD's End, and, for the same Reason, must be mine; for, from the Nature of the End, we may, in some good Measure, discover what are those Means, whether more immediate or remote, that do naturally tend to the Attainment of it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Quoties quid, fugiendum fit, aut quid petendum voles scire, ad summum bonum &amp; propositum totius vitae respice. <HI>Sen.

Therefore GOD Himself, with all the Truth and Good that is contained or implied in Him, and derived from Him, so far forth as I can attain to the practical Knowledge of it, must necessarily be the proper Object of my rational and active Powers, or the Powers of my reasonable and im∣mortal Nature; and consequently He must be my chief Good, objectively considered. And accordingly, in Correspondence to the Object, my <HI>Duty</HI> and <HI>Happiness</HI> (which is my chief Good <HI>formally</HI> considered) must consist in knowing, chu∣sing, loving, and acquiescing in Him, and in re∣sembling or being like Him, as far as ever I am able: In a Word, in the Contemplation and Love of Him, and all that Truth and Good which flows from Him; and in forming the Tem∣per of my Heart, and the Conduct of my Life, conformable thereunto. And this being my true Perfection and Happiness, must most certainly be His Will and Law, who wills my Happiness as
<PB N="59" REF="006859_0192_102AAC9BE30D9A30"/>
His End in giving me my Being, and in all His Dispensations towards me. (Part I. Chap III. § 6, 7, 10.)</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. FROM hence it followeth, that my Duty and Happiness must, in general, consist in the Union of my Will with His; in sincerely chusing what He chuseth, and delighting in whatsoever He delights in; in submitting to whatever <HI>In∣structions</HI> He shall think fit to give, or whatever <HI>Laws</HI> He shall think fit to enjoin, either by <HI>Na∣ture</HI> or <HI>Revelation;</HI> and in resigning to the whole System or <HI>Constitution</HI> which He hath established, both <HI>natural</HI> and <HI>moral:</HI> And consequently, in patiently bearing whatever He is pleased to allot, and in conducting towards every Person and Thing, as being what it really is, and what He hath made it, as He Himself doth, and in go∣verning myself in my whole Temper and Beha∣viour, by all those Rules which promote the ge∣neral Weal of the whole System, as GOD doth Himself; always avoiding what is wrong or hurtful, as being contrary thereunto; and doing what is right or beneficial, as being agreeable to it, on all Occasions as they offer. And all this I must do with a hearty Well-meaning, in a designed Compliance with His Will, and from a Sense of Duty and Gratitude to Him, as the great Crea∣tor and Governor of the World, and the Father and Friend of Mankind (Part I. Chap. II. § 19.) and stedfastly persevere in such a Conduct, in spite of all Temptations to the contrary (<HI>Introd.</HI> 6.) This is what is implied in the general Du∣ties of <HI>Sincerity</HI> and <HI>Integrity.</HI></P>
<P N="7">§ 7. I MUST, therefore, in order hereunto, duly exercise my Understanding, in acquainting myself with the whole Constitution of Things,
<PB N="60" REF="006859_0193_102AAC9E20FC8CB0"/>
and in making from thence a just Estimate a∣mong the several Kinds and Degrees of <HI>Good</HI> and <HI>Evil;</HI> and always prefer a <HI>greater</HI> Good be∣fore a <HI>less,</HI> and a <HI>lesser</HI> Evil before a <HI>greater.</HI> And, because the <HI>Soul</HI> is by far more excellent than the <HI>Body;</HI> the Interest of the <HI>whole Community</HI> much greater than that of any one <HI>Individual;</HI> and <HI>Eternity</HI> of vastly more importance than <HI>Time;</HI> I must, therefore, willingly suffer <HI>bodily Evils,</HI> to avoid <HI>spiritual; private,</HI> to prevent <HI>publick;</HI> and <HI>temporal,</HI> in order to secure against those that are <HI>Eternal.</HI> And I must resign the Goods of the <HI>Body,</HI> or the animal Nature, to those of the <HI>Soul; private</HI> Goods, to those of the <HI>Publick;</HI> and the Goods of <HI>Time,</HI> to those of <HI>Eternity. (Introd.</HI> 10.)</P>
<P N="8">§ 8. THE <HI>Divine Law,</HI> which is immutable Truth, is, in itself, the Rule or Standard, con∣formable to which we are to form our Judgments, and to chuse and act with regard to these several Goods: But the immediate Rule as to us, can be no other than the inward Sense of our own Reason and <HI>Conscience</HI> duly informed, which is that Judgment we make of our Tempers and Actions, according to what Sense or Apprehen∣sion we have of Right and Wrong, or what we take to be conformable or contrary to that Law. And this Judgment must antecedently determine what we ought to do and avoid, and will conse∣quently give Sentence, whether we have done well or ill. (<HI>Introd.</HI> 15, 22. And Part I. Chap. I. § 6.) Hence ariseth the Distinction of our Ac∣tions, into such as are either <HI>materially</HI> or <HI>formally</HI> good or evil. If our Actions are such as are really agreeable to the Rule, and productive of Happiness, they are said to be <HI>materially</HI> good, even tho' we have no Sense of Duty, or good
<PB N="61" REF="006859_0194_102AACA0F9509B80"/>
Intention in what we do: But in order that an Action be <HI>formally Good,</HI> it is necessary, not only that it be conformable to the Rule, but that it be done from a Sense of Duty, and with an In∣tention to do what is right and well pleasing to GOD; <HI>Evil</HI> the contrary. It is therefore a Matter of the highest Importance, that I faith∣fully endeavour to inform my Conscience, what it is my Duty to do and avoid, as being agreea∣ble or contrary to the divine Law; that in <HI>doubt∣ful</HI> Cases, I suspend Acting till I have used all the Means in my Power, and duly endeavoured to inform myself; and that having so done, I do religiously and stedfastly endeavour to act up to the Dictates of my own Conscience thus inform∣ed, and this from a Sense of Duty to that GOD on whom I depend, and to whom I am account∣able (Part I. Chap. II. § 19.) If after all my best Care, in the Circumstances in which He has placed me, I have made a Mistake, I may hope in His Goodness, that He will excuse me, and accept of my Sincerity; but this I can in no wise expect, if my Mistake was occasioned either by supine Negligence, or any criminal Pas∣sion.</P>
<P N="9">§ 9. AND that my Conscience may be thoroughly and universally informed in all the Branches of my Duty; and in as much as my Happiness depends on my conducting right in the Whole, as I stand variously situated and re∣lated, I must descend to Particulars, and duly consider myself in all the Relations wherein I stand, that I may affect and behave myself sui∣tably to them, and so be happy in each of them. And they may all be reduced to these three ge∣neral Heads, <HI>viz.</HI> To <HI>myself, my GOD,</HI> and <HI>my

Neighbour;</HI> correspondent to which are the gene∣ral Duties of <HI>Temperance, Piety</HI> and <HI>Benevo∣lence.</HI> Particularly, I. My <HI>first</HI> Relation is to <HI>myself,</HI> which obligeth me, in Faithfulness to myself, to behave suitably to that rational, active and immortal Nature, which GOD hath given me, that I may be happy in that; and this is called <HI>Human Virtue,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Dr. <HI>Scott,</HI> Part I.</NOTE> or Virtue due to that <HI>Human Nature</HI> whereof I consist, and may be expressed by the general Term <HI>Temperance.</HI> II. My <HI>second</HI> Relation is to GOD, my Maker, Preserver and Governor, which obligeth me, in Faithfulness to Him, as well as to myself, to be∣have myself suitably to the Character of such a glorious Being as He is on whom I depend, that I may be happy in Him: And this is <HI>Divine Vir∣tue,</HI> or Virtue due to the <HI>DEITY,</HI> and may be expressed by the general Term <HI>Piety.</HI> III. My <HI>third</HI> Relation is to my Fellow Creatures, and e∣specially those of my own Species, of the same rational, social and immortal Nature with my∣self, which obligeth me, both in Faithfulness to myself and others, to behave suitably to the so∣cial Character, or in such a Manner as is fit, de∣cent and right, towards such a System of Beings as they are, that I may be happy in them, and they in me; and this is called <HI>Social Virtue,</HI> or Virtue due to <HI>Society,</HI> and may be expressed by the general Term <HI>Benevolence.</HI> So that every Branch of Virtue is, in Effect, an Instance of <HI>Justice</HI> or Righteousness, which implieth, in the general Notion of it, rendering what is due, or treating every Person and Thing as being what it really is.</P>
<P N="10">§ 10. THESE <HI>Relations,</HI> and the <HI>Duties</HI> corre∣spondent to them, are said to be, in the general
<PB N="63" REF="006859_0196_102AACA615F73AE0"/>
Nature of them, of eternal and immutable Obli∣gation; because if I or other Creatures had ne∣ver existed, or should be no more, and so the Fact should cease; yet it is, and always was, and ever will be, impossible to conceive of such a Being as I am, and so situated, to myself, my Maker, and my Fellow Creatures, but that these Obligations will immutably take hold of me; it being necessarily implied in the very Notion of such a Creature in such a Situation, that he should be obliged to such a Conduct (<HI>Introd.</HI> 11.) And as the general Notion of <HI>Sincerity</HI> or <HI>Pro∣bity</HI> implieth the Performance of these Duties, as well in the inward Temper and Disposition of our Hearts, as in the outward Actions or Behaviour of our Lives, I must accordingly consider it as my first Care, to lay a good Foundation within, and to aim at nothing but the Truth and Right of the Case upon all Occasions, in Opposition to all Hypocrisy, since, in the right Performance of these Duties, consists the highest Perfection and Happiness of my rational, social and immortal Nature.

<P N="1">§ 1. (I.) IT is therefore necessary, in order to answer the End of my Being, <HI>by be∣ing what I ought to be,</HI> that I first begin at home, and consider seriously what the Duties are that I owe to myself, which are called <HI>Human Virtues,</HI> and may be comprehended under the general Term,
<PB N="64" REF="006859_0197_102AACA79EC7C6A8"/>
<HI>Temperance,</HI> or a right Government of all my Powers, Appetites and Passions, being due to that human, active and immortal Nature, which GOD hath given me, as being necessary to its Happiness within itself. And I the rather begin with these, as being necessary in order to both the other Branches. And,</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. (1.) FROM what hath been said, it is plain, That the <HI>first</HI> Duty incumbent upon me, as a reasonable active Creature, in order to an∣swer the End of my Being, is, to cultivate and improve the <HI>Reason</HI> and Understanding which GOD hath given me, to be the governing Prin∣ciple and great Law of my Nature (Part I. Chap. III. § 7.) to search and know the <HI>Truth,</HI> and find out wherein my true Happiness con∣sists, and the Means necessary to it, and from thence the Measures of <HI>Right</HI> and <HI>Wrong,</HI> and to discipline and regulate my Will, Affections, Appetites and Passions, according to Reason and Truth, that I may freely and readily embrace the one, and reject the other, in order that I may be truly happy. This general Virtue is called <HI>Mo∣ral Wisdom</HI> or <HI>Prudence,</HI> and stands in Opposition to <HI>Indiscretion</HI> and <HI>Incogitancy.</HI> And, to descend to Particulars,</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. (2.) Because <HI>Pride</HI> consisteth in a mise∣rable Delusion, in thinking of Things otherwise than as being what they really are, and particu∣larly in having too great an Opinion of ourselves, which is a Temper utterly destructive of all Im∣provement and Proficiency either in Knowledge or Virtue, and odious in the Sight both of GOD and Man; and since I am nothing of myself, and am intirely dependent on GOD for all that I am, and have, and hope for; and am at the
<PB N="65" REF="006859_0198_102AACAB16995EB0"/>
same time conscious of so many Sins and Infirmi∣ties, and other humbling Considerations, with re∣spect both to my Body and Mind, and every Thing about me (Part I. Chap. I. § 14, 15, 16.) It is in the next Place incumbent upon me, to consider seriously and <HI>know myself,</HI> and <HI>not to think of my∣self more highly than I ought to think, but to think soberly,</HI> according to what I really am. And this Virtue is called <HI>Humility,</HI> which is the true Foun∣dation of all others, as it makes us very cautious of our own Conduct, and lays us prostrate before the DEITY, and disposeth us to treat others with great Temper, Tenderness and Affability; and stands in Opposition to every Degree of <HI>Pride, Arrogance,</HI> and <HI>Self-sufficiency.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="4">§ 4 (3.) AS our <HI>Reason</HI> and Consideration is manifestly given us to make a just Estimate of Things, and to preside over our inferior Powers, and to proportion our several <HI>Appetites</HI> and <HI>Pas∣sions,</HI> to the real Nature, and intrinsic Value of their respective Objects (Part I. Chap. III. § 7.) so as not to <HI>love</HI> or <HI>hate, hope</HI> or <HI>fear, joy</HI> or <HI>grieve,</HI> be <HI>pleased</HI> or <HI>displeased</HI> at any Thing, be∣yond the real Importance of it to our Happi∣ness or Misery, in the Whole of our Nature and Duration; it must therefore be my Duty to keep a due Ballance among them, to keep them with∣in their proper Bounds, and to take Care that they do not exceed or fall short of the real Na∣ture and Measure of their several Objects; and especially so as not to suffer them to tempt or hurry me on to trespass upon any of the Duties that I owe either to GOD or Man. This is the Office of that Virtue which is called <HI>Modera∣tion</HI> or <HI>Equanimity,</HI> and stands in Opposition to
<PB N="66" REF="006859_0199_102AACAD5E7B5C28"/>
all <HI>ungoverned Lusts</HI> and <HI>Passions.</HI> More particu∣larly,</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. (4.) BECAUSE <HI>animal Appetites,</HI> and <HI>flesh∣ly Lusts</HI> (I mean the Appetites to Meat and Drink, and other carnal Pleasures, and whatsoever else is of the <HI>concupiscible</HI> Kind) <HI>do war against the Soul,</HI> and an immoderate Indulgence to them doth sen∣sualize and enervate, and, by Consequence, mise∣rably debase and weaken its superior and noble Powers, and alienate them from their proper Ob∣jects, and at the same time extremely hurt the Temperature and Health of the Body, and may be very mischievous to others as well as myself, and utterly disqualify me for the Service, Enjoy∣ment and Favour of GOD (Part I. Chap. I. § 15.) it must therefore be my Duty to maintain a perpetual War with them, to curb and restrain them, <HI>to keep them under, and bring them into Sub∣jection,</HI> and regulate them by the Ends designed by GOD and Nature, in planting them in us; which is the Office of the Virtues called <HI>Tempe∣rance</HI> (strictly so called) or <HI>Sobriety</HI> and <HI>Chastity,</HI> which stand in Opposition to all <HI>Intemperance</HI> and <HI>Debauchery.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. (5.) WHEREAS the turbulent Passions of <HI>Anger, Grief</HI> and <HI>Fear (i. e.</HI> Displeasure and Un∣easiness at what we already feel or imagine, and anxious Apprehensions of what may seem im∣pending, or whatever else is of the <HI>Irascible</HI> Kind) are apt to warp and byass our Minds, and disable us for a right Judgment and Conduct; to destroy the Peace and Tranquility of our Minds, and create a wretched Tumult within our own Breasts, and frequently prompt us to inju∣rious Words and Actions on the one Hand, or mean Compliances on the other <HI>(Ibid.)</HI> it must
<PB N="67" REF="006859_0200_102AACAEF8DE4DC8"/>
therefore be my Duty to keep them also, as far as may be, under the due Government of my Reason, and not to suffer them much to ruffle and discompose me, much less to tyrannize over me, or any ways disable me for any Duty I owe either to GOD or Man, or tempt me to any Thing injurious to others, or mischievous to So∣ciety: Which is the Office of those Virtues that are called <HI>Meekness, Patience</HI> and <HI>Fortitude,</HI> which stand in Opposition to <HI>Wrath, Hatred, Impa∣tience</HI> and <HI>Pusillanimity.</HI></P>
<P N="7">§ 7. (6.) FORASMUCH as I am placed by GOD in the Station I am in, whatever it be, and He expects I should faithfully discharge the Duties of it, in Proportion to the Powers and Abilities He hath given me; and hath made my own Diligence and Activity in the Use of them, the natural Means of my Well-being and Usefulness, exclusive of immoderate Cares and Desires (Part I. Chap. I. § 10. And Chap. II. § 19, 20.) it must there∣fore be my Duty to resign to His Dispositions, and to acquiesce in His Allotments, to keep my Station, and rest satisfied with the Condition in which He hath placed me, and contentedly and chearfully discharge the Duties of it; and be active and industrious in the Use of the Powers and Talents He hath furnished me with, both for my own Advantage, and the Good of others; for the Benefit of the Publick as well as myself; for my comfortable Subsistence in this Life, and my everlasting Happiness in the Life to come; all which are the Business of those Virtues which are called <HI>Contentment, Frugality</HI> and <HI>Industry,</HI> in Opposition to <HI>Discontent, Envy, Avarice, Ambi∣tion</HI> and <HI>Idleness.</HI></P>

Chap. II. § 19. And Chap. III. § 21.) it must therefore be the most impor∣tant Duty of my Life, while I continue in this present Condition, to be, in a good Measure, disengaged from this World, and from my Body and Time, and to provide in the best Manner I can, for the endless State which is before me; and, in order hereunto, to be daily improving my Soul in Knowledge and Virtue (especially the following Virtues, both <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>social</HI>) and to be disciplining and training up myself in all those Accomplishments and Qualifications, which alone can be of any Use to me when I am called off this present Stage, and which will prepare me to be inconceivably and everlastingly happy in the Life to come.

<P N="1">§ 1. (II.) I PROCEED now, in the <HI>second</HI> Place, to the Consideration of the Relation we stand in to Almighty GOD. In Pursuance of which, it is necessary that I seri∣ously consider what is due to the Character of such a glorious Being, as resulting from that Relation I stand in to Him, in order that I may be happy in Him; or what those Duties are which I owe to that All-wise, Almighty and most just and benevolent Being, from whom I derive, and on whom I depend; which are called the <HI>Divine Virtues,</HI> and are comprehended under the general Name <HI>Piety;</HI> without the faithful Perfor∣mance of which, I shall rob Him of His just Due, in not conducting towards Him, as being what He is, and at the same time rob myself of the greatest Happiness, as He is my chief Good. And,</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. (1.) INASMUCH as GOD is a Being of all possible Perfection and Excellency, the great Creator, Preserver and Governor of the World, on whom I do intirely depend for my Being, and all my Enjoyments here, and all my Hopes to all Eternity, and to whom I am accountable for all that I think, speak and do (Part I. Chap. II. § 19.) it is therefore my indispensible Duty in general, to own and <HI>acknowledge</HI> Him, and to live under a deep, serious and habitual Sense of Him as such, and to <HI>believe</HI> in Him, and <HI>faith∣fully</HI> endeavour to <HI>obey</HI> and please Him in all my

Behaviour. This Duty is called the <HI>Knowledge</HI> or <HI>Acknowledgment</HI> of GOD, and <HI>Faith</HI> or <HI>Faith∣fulness</HI> to Him; and stands in Opposition to the <HI>Ignorance</HI> of Him, and <HI>Atheism</HI> and <HI>Unbelief,</HI> and to a <HI>Neglect</HI> of Him, and <HI>Disregard</HI> to His Au∣thority and Government. And,</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. (2.) BECAUSE GOD is a Being of in∣finite Perfection and Excellency, and therefore infinitely amiable in Himself, and is also the great Parent Mind, and universal Father of Spirits, and the Source of all Beauty, Order and Happi∣ness, and is accordingly, as a tender Parent, un∣speakably kind and benevolent to me, and to all the World, and continually doing Good, and providing every Thing needful for my Subsistence and Well being; and by what He is, and has done for me hitherto, hath given me all the Rea∣son imaginable to believe, that if I faithfully en∣deavour to resemble and please Him, He will not fail to make me for ever as happy as my Ca∣pacity will admit of (<HI>Ibid.</HI> And Chap.

under all Difficulties, to keep me from whatsoever may hinder or interrupt my Well-being, and to secure to me every Thing that is requisite to my Happiness <HI>(Ibid.)</HI> it must therefore be my Duty to <HI>confide</HI> in Him intirely, in the Way of <HI>Well-doing,</HI> with a secure <HI>Acquiescence</HI> in His All-wise and All-powerful Goodness, which, in one Word, is His <HI>All-sufficiency.</HI> This Duty is called <HI>Trust,</HI> or <HI>Confidence</HI> in GOD, in Opposition to all <HI>Di∣strust</HI> and <HI>Diffidence.</HI> And,</P>

not but expect the severest Punishments, if I live in Opposition to His Will, who is constantly pre∣sent with me, and sees all the Tempers of my Heart, and Actions of my Life, and will, in a little Time, call me to Account for them (Part I. Chap.

I must therefore think it my Duty to be as <HI>like</HI> Him as ever I can, in all my Tempers and Deportment; <HI>Holy</HI> as He is <HI>Holy, Righteous</HI> as He is <HI>Righteous, True</HI> and <HI>Faithful, Kind</HI> and <HI>Merciful</HI> as He is.

<P N="8">§ 8. (7.) AND <HI>lastly,</HI> since GOD is that Being from whom we receive all that we enjoy, and on whom we depend for all that we want both for Time and Eternity (Part I. Chap. II. § 6. and Chap. III. § 16.) and since it is fit and

right in itself that we own him to be what he is, and of great Advantage to us that we live under a deep and habitual Sense of this our Dependence upon him, and our Obligations to him; and that Gratitude requireth our just Acknowledgments; it must therefore be our bounden Duty, to all these good Purposes, and for the improving in us every Kind of Virtue, that we do, every Day that we live, most gratefully <HI>praise</HI> him for every Thing we receive, and <HI>pray</HI> to him for all that we want; and we live a most unnatural and brutish Life, if we neglect so to do. And be∣cause we cannot do this with any Meaning, with∣out that Love, Trust, Resignation, Reverence and Imitation, which I have demonstrated to be our Duties towards him; therefore these Tem∣pers and Dispositions must ever be supposed to at∣tend all our Prayers and Praises, which are com∣prehended under the general Name of <HI>Devotion,</HI> or the <HI>Worship</HI> of GOD, in Opposition to all <HI>Profaneness, Irreligion, Superstition</HI> and <HI>Idolatry.</HI></P>

AND inasmuch as Mankind do thus de∣pend upon GOD, and receive innumerable Fa∣vours from Him, not only in their single, but al∣so in their social Capacity; and as there is a pe∣culiar Fitness in it, as we are all Children of the same common Parent, the great <HI>Father of Spirits,</HI> that we should, not only severally, but jointly, as Brethren, pay our common Homage, and testify our grateful Sense of our common De∣pendence and Obligations; and as our joint Per∣formance of this Duty does open Honour to Him in the World, and hath, at the same time, a natural Tendency, the more ardently to affect our Hearts with Devotion to Him, as well as to unite us the more strongly in mutual
<PB N="74" REF="006859_0207_102A7B866466C960"/>
Benevolence one towards another: It is therefore <HI>fit, right, and our bounden Duty,</HI> to worship GOD, not only severally, but also jointly, in our <HI>Fa∣milies,</HI> and in publick <HI>Communities,</HI> upon such stated Seasons, and in such Forms, Gestures and other Circumstances, as are generally agreed up∣on to be most expressive of Reverence, Duty and Devotion to him. This is the great Duty of <HI>publick Worship;</HI> to the honourable Support of which, we ought, therefore, both for GOD's Sake and our own, jointly and liberally to con∣tribute. And thus much for our Duty towards GOD.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. IV.</HI> Of the Duties which we owe to our <HI>Fellow Creatures,</HI> or to those of our own <HI>Species</HI> and <HI>Society</HI> in general, and to our <HI>Rela∣tives</HI> in particular.</HEAD>
<P N="1">§ 1. (III.) I PROCEED now, in the <HI>third</HI> Place, to the Consideration of the Relation we stand in one to another: In Pursuance of which, it is neces∣sary that I seriously consider what is due to the social Character as resulting from that Relation; or what those Duties are which I owe to my Fellow Creatures, especially those of my own Species, which are called <HI>Social Virtues,</HI> and are comprehended under the general Term, <HI>Benevo∣lence,</HI> of which they are so many Branches; and they consist in general, in treating or behaving towards them as being what they and I are, that
<PB N="75" REF="006859_0208_102AACBC857AF058"/>
I may be happy in them, and they in me. And as to these,</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. (1.) SINCE, as I have above observed, being furnished with Reason and Speech, and so∣cial Affections, we are evidently made for So∣ciety (Part I. Chap. I. §. 13.) and since we are placed, by the Condition of our Nature, not only in a State of Dependence on Almighty GOD, our common Heavenly Parent, but also in a State of mutual Dependence on each other for our Well-being and Happiness (for that in many Cases we cannot well subsist without each others Help, and by the good or ill Use of our Powers, we are capable of being either very useful, or very mischievous to each other) and since, by the Powers of Reflection and Reason∣ing, we are enabled to place ourselves in each other's Stead, and to make a Judgment from what we feel in ourselves, how we should wish to be used by others, and to discover what is best in the Whole, for our common Safety and mutual Advantage (<HI>Introd.</HI> 17.) it is from these Consi∣derations manifest, that, in general, it must be our Duty to consider ourselves as such, and so situated and related, as in Fact we are, and to cul∣tivate a hearty good Will one towards another as Brethren; to do nothing hurtful, and all that is beneficial to each other, as far as we may or can, and to enter into Combinations and Compacts for promoting our common Interest and Safety; to resign every one his own private Advantage to that of the Community, in which his own is best secured, and to make the common Good the Standard by which to judge of his own Duty and Interest, and be inflexibly governed by it. Such, in general, is the Disposition of <HI>Benevolence,</HI> which,
<PB N="76" REF="006859_0209_102AACBEB45A63B8"/>
taking its Rise in the first Connections of the In∣dividuals, spreads thro' the whole social System, and issues in, and strongly prompts to <HI>publick Virtue,</HI> and the <HI>Love</HI> of our <HI>Country,</HI> and our <HI>Species,</HI> in Opposition to every Thing that implies <HI>Malevolence, Selfishness</HI> and <HI>private Spiritedness.</HI> But to be particular in its several Branches rising from the lowest to the highest:</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. (2.) INASMUCH as I have several Things which I call <HI>my own,</HI> to which I have a <HI>Right,</HI> being possessed of them either by the free Gift of God, or by my own Activity and Industry, with his Blessing, and find they are greatly useful to my Comfort and Well-being, and feel a great Plea∣sure in the unmolested Enjoyment of them, and Trouble in being deprived of them: And when I am molested or deprived by any One, without having justly forfeited them by my own Miscon∣duct, I feel a strong Sense of Injury, and must therefore by Reflection conclude, that every other Person hath the same Sense of Injury in the like Case as I have; it must therefore be my Duty, and the first Dictate of <HI>Benevolence,</HI> not to do Injury to others in any Respect, whether it re∣lates to their Souls, Bodies, Names or Estates, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and the rather, as I would wish to suffer no Injury from them in any of these Respects. (Part I. Chap. I. § 7.) This Disposition is called <HI>Innocence</HI> and <HI>Inoffensiveness,</HI> in Opposition to <HI>Injuriousness</HI> and <HI>Mischievousness.</HI></P>
<P N="4">§ 4. (3.) PARTICULARLY; since I know that I cannot endure to be hurt in my Person, either in Soul or Body; to be robbed of my Liberty, Estate, Wife or Children; to be belied or misre∣presented in my Name or Reputation, and to be deceived and imposed upon, or any wise oppres∣sed
<PB N="77" REF="006859_0210_102AACC19F9F5640"/>
in my Dealings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as I must conclude it to be wrong to treat others ill in any of these, or the like Instances; so, on the other Hand, for the same Reason that I think it right, that, in Sub∣ordination to the publick Sense and Interest (<HI>i. e.</HI> supposing no Forfeiture) every One should allow me the quiet and peaceable Enjoyment of my own, my Innocence, Life, Limbs, Liberty, Estate, Wife, Children, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and speak nothing but the Truth to me, and of me, and deal equi∣taby, fairly and faithfully with me, and in every Thing treat me as being what I am and have, <HI>(Ibid.)</HI> I must think it right, and my Duty ac∣cordingly, from the same Principle, to treat others with Equity in all these Respects, as I would wish to be treated by them in the like Cir∣cumstances. And this Duty is called <HI>Justice,</HI> in the strict Sense of it, which comprehends <HI>Exam∣plariness, Equity, Truth</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> in Op∣position to all Instances of <HI>Injustice;</HI> such as, <HI>tempting</HI> to Sin, <HI>Murther, Maiming, Adultery, Fornication, Stealth, Robbery, Oppression, Lying, Defamation, Unfaithfulness</HI> to Engagements, <HI>Cheating,</HI> and all <HI>Deceitfulness.</HI></P>
<P N="5">§ 5. (4.) FOR the like Reasons; since I feel a great Delight in being well respected, duly esteem'd, well spoken of, and kindly treated by others (Part I. Chap. I. § 13.) I must think it my Duty, from the same benevolent Princi∣ple, to treat others with all such Disposi∣tions, Acts and Instances of Kindness and good Usage, as I should, in my Turn, reasonably ex∣pect, and take Pleasure in receiving; to be rea∣dy to all good Offices in my Power to others, whether Neighbours or Strangers, whether to their Souls or Bodies; to say the best of them,
<PB N="78" REF="006859_0211_102AACC36B3E9E20"/>
and put the kindest and most favourable Con∣struction I can upon what they say or do; and to conduct towards them with Humanity, Can∣dour, Affability and Courtesy. And as I find a great Solace under Pain and Distress in the Pity and Assistance of others; so I must think it my Duty to have the like Sentiments of Compassion and Tenderness towards them in the like Cir∣cumstances, whether of Mind, Body or Estate, and should think I acted unnaturally, if I did not contribute all I could, consistent with other Obli∣gations, to their Comfort and Relief. Thus by reflecting and conceiving ourselves in each other's Circumstances (Part I. Chap. I. § 5.) our Love to ourselves becomes the Foundation of our Love to others, and causeth us to take Pleasure in their Enjoyments, and in communicating Pleasure to them; to delight in good Offices, and in speak∣ing kindly to them, and of them; and to sym∣pathize with them in their Calamities, and be ready to relieve them. All which are implied in the general Duty of <HI>Charity,</HI> which therefore comprehends <HI>Candour, Affability, Hospitality, Mercy, Tenderness</HI> and <HI>Beneficence,</HI> in Opposition to all Instances of <HI>Uncharitableness,</HI> such as <HI>Cen∣soriousness, Moroseness, Envy, Ill-nature, Cruelty</HI> and <HI>Hardheartedness.</HI></P>
<P N="6">§ 6. (5.) INASMUCH as it is manifest, from what was observed above, under the first general Head of the Duty we owe to Society, that it is incumbent upon us to do all we can to promote the Weal of our Fellow-Creatures, and to have a principal Zeal for the general Good, on which our own Welfare does very much depend (Part I. Chap. I. § 13. And Part II. Chap. I. § 6.) and since there may be several Things in our
<PB N="79" REF="006859_0212_102AACC6EBE44460"/>
Power, above and beyond what meer Justice and Humanity require, wherein we may be useful to others, and to the Publick; I must think it my Duty, from the same Principle, to be of a free and generous Spirit as far as I am able; to be forward and ready to every good Work, and to delight in doing Good, as GOD himself does, whereinsoever I may be useful in promoting his Honour, and the Good of Mankind; and this from a Sense of Gratitude to him for all I enjoy. This Virtue is called <HI>Liberality, Generosity</HI> and <HI>Magnificence,</HI> in Opposition to <HI>Covetousness</HI> and <HI>Niggardliness,</HI> or a <HI>grudging, narrow</HI> and <HI>con∣tracted Spirit.</HI> And for any Benefits received ei∣ther of GOD or Man, <HI>Gratitude</HI> is due to the Benefactor, in Opposition to a stupid <HI>ungrateful Spirit,</HI> which is extremely base and odious.</P>
<P N="7">§ 7. (6.) SINCE the Peace and Quietness of Society, which are indispensably necessary to its Happiness, depend not only on our avoiding eve∣ry Thing that is injurious, and doing all that is just, kind and generous, but also upon every One's being contented in his own Station, and faithfully endeavouring to discharge the Duties of it, without intermeddling in Affairs that do not belong to his Province; and upon every One's being of a Peace-making and forgiving Spirit, (Part II. Chap. II. § 6.) I must therefore think it my Duty to keep within my own Sphere, and mind my own Business, and do the Duty that be∣longs to my own Station; and if I have done any Wrong, to repair the Injury, and make Restitu∣tion, and ask Forgiveness, as well as to be of a forgiving Spirit towards others, as I would hope GOD to be so towards me; and in a Word, to do all that is in my Power for promoting and pre∣serving
<PB N="80" REF="006859_0213_102AACC90EC8D210"/>
Friendship, good Neighbourhood, and the Publick Tranquility. These Duties are cal∣led <HI>Quietness, Peaceableness, Friendliness,</HI> and <HI>For∣giveness,</HI> in Opposition to <HI>Ambition, Contention, Unfriendliness,</HI> and <HI>Irreconcileableness.</HI></P>
<P N="8">§ 8. (7.) AND <HI>lastly,</HI> since, according to the present Condition of our Nature, it cannot be but various Relations and Connections must ob∣tain, as being necessary for the Subsistence and Well-being of our Species, both in Mind, Body and Estate; such as Husband and Wife, Parents and Children, Masters and Servants, Magistrates and Subjects, Teachers and Learners, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (Part I. Chap. I. § 13.) it must be my Duty, which soever of these Conditions I am placed in, to behave myself suitably to it. If I am a <HI>Husband</HI> or <HI>Wife,</HI> I must be tenderly loving, faithful and helpful: If I am a <HI>Parent.</HI> I must be tender of my helpless Off-spring, and do all I can to instruct and form both their Minds and Manners to the best Advantage, and provide for them in the best Manner I am able, consistent with every other Duty: And if I am a <HI>Child,</HI> I must be grateful, and tenderly helpful, dutiful and obe∣dient to my Parents, from whom I derived, and on whom I do or have depended, when unable to help myself; and have a peculiar Tenderness and Friendship for my Brethren and Sisters, and other Relatives: If I am a <HI>Master,</HI> I must be just and kind to my Servant; and if I am a <HI>Servant,</HI> I must be dutiful, obedient and faithful to my Master: If I am a <HI>Magistrate,</HI> I must be zealous for the publick Good, and upright, faith∣ful and impartial in my Administration: And if I am <HI>Subject,</HI> I must be submissive and orderly, in Obedience to Law and Authority: If I am a
<PB N="81" REF="006859_0214_102AACCB360909D0"/>
<HI>Teacher,</HI> I must be ready and faithful to guide and instruct: And if I am a <HI>Learner,</HI> I must be willing to be guided, and ready to follow the In∣structions that are given me, and to reward the Labours of such as have the Care of me. In a Word, if I am in any <HI>superior</HI> Station of Life, I must be treatable and condescending; and if in an <HI>inferior</HI> Condition, I must be modest, respect∣ful and decent in all my Deportment; and what∣soever Situation of Life it is, wherein I am placed, I must take Care to act up to my Character, whatever it be; both in those lesser Societies founded in <HI>Nature,</HI> which are called <HI>Families,</HI> and those larger Societies founded in <HI>Compact,</HI> whe∣ther tacit or explicit, called <HI>Civil Governments;</HI> to which all <HI>Honour, Submission</HI> and <HI>Obedience,</HI> is due in all Things lawful and honest, in Opposi∣tion to all Instances of <HI>Turbulence, Faction</HI> and <HI>Rebellion.</HI> All which relative Duties, in Con∣junction with the rest, are indispensibly necessary to the moral Order, and the publick Peace and Happiness of Mankind, and terminate in that noblest of all social Passions, the <HI>Love of our Country,</HI> joined with an ardent Zeal for every Thing that concerns its Weal. And thus much for our Duties towards Society.</P>

<HEAD><HI>CHAP. V.</HI> Of the <HI>Subordinate Duties,</HI> or <HI>Means</HI> for the more ready and faithful Discharge of the Duties above explained.</HEAD>
<P N="1">§ 1. HAVING thus deduced, from the great Principles of Truth above de∣monstrated, the principal Branches of moral Du∣ty
<PB N="82" REF="006859_0215_102AACCDEF450F18"/>
founded on them, both towards GOD, <HI>our∣selves,</HI> and our <HI>Neighbours;</HI> I proceed now to enumerate the chief of those <HI>subordinate Duties,</HI> which are to be performed as Means of <HI>Culture,</HI> for begetting, improving and perfecting in us those <HI>moral Virtues.</HI> And this will be done in answer to the two last of those great Enquiries (<HI>Introd.</HI> 27.) <HI>viz.</HI> V. <HI>Whether I am what I ought to be?</HI> And if not, VI. <HI>What I ought to do, as a Means in order to be and do what I ought, and so in order finally to answer the End of my Being?</HI></P>
<P N="2">§ 2. THE <HI>first</HI> of those two last Enquiries will put us upon the great Duty of <HI>Self-examination,</HI> which is a Duty of very great Importance to us; for if we do not examine and truly <HI>know ourselves,</HI> and what is our real State, how shall we be able to rectify what is amiss, that we may be in a Condi∣tion to give a good Account of ourselves at last? And as <HI>Seneca</HI> says, <HI>Illi mors gravis incubat,— qui nimis notus omnibus,—ignotus moritur sibi.</HI> He dies a grievous Death indeed,—who too much known to others, dies—a Stranger to himself!</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. (1.) LET this then be the <HI>first</HI> Rule in order to answer the Demands of these last Questions, and the first Means in order to become what I ought to be, <HI>viz.</HI> To inure myself to a Habit of <HI>serious Consideration;</HI> to suspend Acting, till I have well weighed the Importance of Things (Part I. Chap. I. § 5.) that I may be under Ad∣vantage to make a wise Choice; and, according to <HI>Pythagoras</HI>'s Advice to his Disciples <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carm. Aur. <HI>Vide</HI> Hierocles.</NOTE>, to enter frequently into my own Heart, and take a daily and exact Survey of my Life and Conduct; to deal faithfully with myself, and to endeavour to think of my Temper and Behaviour, as being
<PB N="83" REF="006859_0216_102AACD012660D70"/>
what it really is, <HI>without Partiality, and without Hypocrisy.</HI></P>
<P N="4">§ 4. (2.) AND as the Knowledge of myself is of so great Importance, let it be the next Rule, that I entertain and cultivate within myself a due Sense of the <HI>Dignity</HI> of my reasonable, active and immortal Nature, as exhibiting a small Image of the Divinity (Part I. Chap. I. § 6, 7, 8. And Chap. II. § 5.) and have a great <HI>Reverence</HI> for it as such: This would make me always careful to do nothing unworthy, indecent or misbecoming it; on the contrary, I should be concerned, on all Occasions, to act the decent Part in Life, or what duly becomes it in all its Relations. Let me especially have a great Reverence for the Sense of my own Conscience, as being the Divine Light irradiating me within, and the Voice of the Deity Himself, that I may take the utmost Care, not to live in any Course whatsoever for which my own Reason and Conscience shall re∣proach me; for as One's Conscience is properly One's Self, it is the greatest Madness in the World, for a Man to live at a perpetual Variance with himself, and the first Point of Wisdom, always to keep Friends with himself.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. (3.) SINCE I depend wholly on GOD, and He is ever present with me, a constant Spec∣tator of all my Behaviour, in the inward Tem∣per and Thoughts of my Heart, as well as in all the outward Actions of my Life, and since I must expect to give an Account of myself to Him (Part I. Chap. II. § 9. and 19.) it must be my next Rule, by the frequent Practice of Meditation and Devotion, to possess myself habi∣tually of a most great and <HI>reverend Sense</HI> of His <HI>universal Presence,</HI> All-sufficiency and Purity, as
<PB N="84" REF="006859_0217_102AACD2E5159B48"/>
well as a most abasing Sense of my own Depen∣dence, Guilt and Impotence, that I may be aw∣fully careful to do nothing unworthy of His Presence and Inspection, and the Relation I stand in to Him, and seriously endeavour, in a humble Dependence upon His gracious Assistance, so to guard and discipline my Thoughts and Affections, as well as my Words and Actions, that they may not be displeasing to His All-seeing Eye, but may obtain His Favour and Approbation, in whose moral Character is contained all that is perfectly right and amiable in itself, and on whose Appro∣bation and Friendship my Happiness all depends.</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. (4.) IT will also be of very good Use to promote in me every Sort of Virtue, and espe∣cially those of the social Kind, to entertain a <HI>great Sense</HI> and <HI>Value</HI> of the <HI>Opinion</HI> and <HI>Estima∣tion</HI> of <HI>Mankind,</HI> who, even the most corrupt of them, and much more the best (whose Esteem is highly to be valued) cannot but entertain a high Opinion of Virtue, and a Reverence and Esteem for the virtuous Character, as well as a Contempt of the Vicious (Part I. Chap. I. § 11.) so that if I have any Desire of either doing any Good to them, or enjoying any Good from them, it must deeply concern me to endeavour to recommend myself to their good Opinion, and this can no otherwise be done, than by always acting the sober, honest, faithful, generous and benevolent Part, in all my Intercourse with them, which cannot fail of en∣gaging an Interest in their Good-will, Esteem and Confidence, and must therefore be the wisest Course I can take to answer all my most impor∣tant Purposes, with Regard to my comfortable Subsistence in this present Life, as well as to qua∣lify me for a better.</P>
<P N="7"><PB N="85" REF="006859_0218_102AACD46CB66D28"/>§ 7. (5.) IF upon a due Survey of my Tem∣per and Behaviour, I find I have acted an unrea∣sonable and vicious Part, as my own Conscience will not fail to reproach me for it, so I cannot avoid feeling a great Deal of Uneasiness and Re∣morse upon reflecting on my Misconduct (Part I. Chap. I. § 6. And Chap. III. § 11.) Now when∣ever I feel any Remorse or Misgivings, I should do wisely to be so far from stifling, that I should rather indulge those Sentiments, and let them have their Course, and improve them into a truly con∣trite Grief. And if I am sorry for what is amiss in my Conduct, as I ought to be, I shall utterly hate and abhor every Vice, as being contrary to GOD, and all that is right and reasonable, and never be easy till I reform and return to my Du∣ty, and be governed by my Reason and Con∣science, and a Sense of Duty to GOD, and eve∣ry wise and good Consideration, for the Time to come. And herein consists the Nature of true <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Reformation.</HI> And,</P>
<P N="8">§ 8. (6.) IF I truly repent of my past Mis∣conduct, I shall be very <HI>watchful</HI> against all those <HI>Temptations</HI> that I find myself exposed to, either from my own Lusts and Passions within, or from the Solicitations of a corrupt and degenerate World without me (Part I. Chap. I. § 15.) As I must consider Virtue to be my greatest Interest, being my true Perfection and Happiness, I shall therefore avoid all ill Places and <HI>bad Company,</HI> where I am most liable to Danger, and consider every Person and Thing as an Enemy that hath a Tendency to rob me of my Innocence, and mis∣lead me from a stedfast Course of virtuous Beha∣viour; and, by Consequence, I shall account those my best Friends that most promote Virtue by
<PB N="86" REF="006859_0219_102AACD6117F4F20"/>
their good Advice, Example, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and there∣fore shall be ambitious of keeping the <HI>best Com∣pany,</HI> and following the best Examples.</P>
<P N="9">§ 9. (7.) I SHALL carefully observe what is my <HI>ruling Passion,</HI> and endeavour to make an Ad∣vantage of it to promote the Interest of Virtue, and against all the Tendencies of Vice, and be more especially upon my Guard against those par∣ticular <HI>Failings,</HI> that I find my own <HI>Constitution</HI> is peculiarly incident to, whether of the concupis∣cible or irascible Kind; whether those of Self-conceit, Lust, Covetousness, Intemperance, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> on the one Hand, or those of Resentment, An∣ger, Impatience, Envy, Revenge, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> on the other; there being, perhaps, scarce a Person to be found, but hath some particular Tendency towards some one Vice more than another, founded in the very Frame of his Nature, which administers Matter and Occasion for particular Humiliation and con∣tinual Discipline. (Part I. Chap. I. § 15.)</P>
<P N="10">§ 10. (8.) IF I find I have any such particular Tendency, and have contracted any vicious Ha∣bit by my Indulgence to it, I must inure myself to <HI>Self-denial</HI> and <HI>Mortification,</HI> till I have got the Ascendant of it! I must consider Slavery as a most wretched and abject Condition, and therefore ne∣ver content myself, till I have gained and maintain the Mastery of myself, so as to be at Liberty rea∣dily to follow the Dictates of my Reason and Conscience, and act up to the Dignity of my ra∣tional active Nature, and the several Connections founded in my Relation to GOD and my Fel∣low Creatures, and so become <HI>what I ought to be.</HI> (Part I. Chap. III. § 11.)</P>
<P N="11">§ 11. (9.) IN order that I may <HI>discipline</HI> my∣self to a Readiness in denying myself in Things
<PB N="87" REF="006859_0220_102AACD9BA2A1360"/>
unlawful, and the more effectually tame and sub∣due my untoward Lusts and Passions, and keep them under a due Regimen; it may be very fit and useful that I frequently practise Self-denial in Things lawful and indifferent; for if I always accustom myself to go to the utmost Bounds of my lawful Liberty, it is a Million to One but I shall be frequently trespassing upon them; for which Reason I should do well, by frequent <HI>Fasting,</HI> to deny myself such Measures or Kinds of Food and Drink, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as might otherwise be lawfully indulged; and particularly such as have a peculiar Tendency to inflame my Lusts and Passions (Part II. Chap. II. § 4.)</P>
<P N="12">§ 12. (10.) I MUST, from a Sense both of the Glory and Dignity of Virtue, and my Duty to Almighty GOD, <HI>resolutely</HI> go into every virtu∣ous Practice, however so much against the Grain, in which I shall act the truly heroic and manly Part; nor must I content myself in any certain Pitch of Virtue to which I imagine myself to have attained, but must <HI>press forward,</HI> and <HI>per∣severe</HI> in a continual Struggle, and perpetual Warfare, throughout my whole Life, and be daily endeavouring to make all possible Profici∣ency in Virtue, till I gain the utmost Facility and Readiness in every virtuous Practice that the Frailty of my Nature will admit of (Part I, Chap. III. § 21.)</P>
<P N="13">§ 13. (11.) IN order to this, I should do well to consider seriously the vast Importance of that inestimable Talent, <HI>Time,</HI> of which I must expect to give an Account to the Author and Preserver of my Being, as well as of all my other Talents. Let therefore an habitual Sense of the Shortness, at the utmost, and of the ex∣treme
<PB N="88" REF="006859_0221_102AACDBFB5D6728" MS="y"/>
Uncertainty of my Life, be ever present and uppermost in my Thoughts, that I may husband every Moment to the best Advantage for the doing what good I can, and acquiring of true Wisdom and Virtue, which are Treasures of the most inestimable Value, as being those on∣ly which can make me truly useful and happy here, and which alone I can carry with me into the future State of my Existence, and which will make me for ever and compleatly happy, when Time shall be no more (Part I. Chap. III. § 21.)</P>
<P N="14">§ 14. (12.) AND, <HI>lastly,</HI> in order to my be∣ing the more effectually engaged to the faithful Discharge of my Duty, in conforming to all the Laws of Virtue, I must endeavour to keep up in my Mind an habitual Sense of their most weighty <HI>Sanctions, viz.</HI> The Happiness or Mise∣ry unavoidably attending my Obedience or Dis∣obedience, both in this and the future State. In this present Life there is the truest Enjoyment of all reasonable Pleasures, without that Remorse and Terror which attends those that are unreaso∣nable and vicious; Health of Body, and Peace of Mind; the Love, Esteem and Confidence of Men, and the Approbation, Favour and Bles∣sing of GOD; true Joy and Satisfaction in Pro∣sperity, and solid Comfort and Calmness in Ad∣versity; the most reasonable Prospect of Success in our Affairs here, and a most comfortable Pro∣spect of Happiness hereafter; so that if there was to be no Life after this, a Course of Virtue would be infinitely preferable to that of Vice, which is unavoidably attended with endless Mischiefs and Perplexities: The Wicked are like the <HI>troubled Sea,</HI> and seldom <HI>live out Half their Days;</HI> where∣as, the Ways of Wisdom and Virtue <HI>are Ways
<PB N="89" REF="006859_0222_102AACDDA7533ED8"/>
of Pleasantness, and all her Paths are Peace; Length of Days is in her Right-hand, and in her Left-hand Riches and Honour.</HI> Sup. 6, and Part I. Chap. III. § 11.</P>
<P N="15">§ 15. BUT then if we look forward to the Life to come, there opens a most glorious Pro∣spect for eternal Ages. As on the one Hand there are most tremendous Punishments attending our Disobedience, there being unavoidable Pain and exquisite Misery necessarily connected with every Vice, arising from the Remorse and Re∣proaches of our own Minds, and the fearful Apprehensions and dismal Effects of the divine Displeasure: So, on the other Hand, there are as certain and most glorious Rewards attending a Course of Obedience, there being unspeakable Pleasure and exquisite Happiness necessarily con∣nected with the Practice of every Virtue, arising both from the natural Fruits and Effects thereof, and from the Approbation and Applauses of our own Minds; from all the Delights of a happy Society, and from the Favour and Friendship of Almighty GOD, to the endless Ages of Eter∣nity (Part I.

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Of the Connection between the</HI> Law <HI>or</HI> Reli∣gion <HI>of</HI> Nature <HI>and</HI> Christianity.</HEAD>
<P N="1">§ 1. HAVING thus given a short Sketch of the first great Principles of <HI>Moral Philosophy,</HI> or what is called the <HI>Religion</HI> or Law of <HI>Nature,</HI> as being founded in the Nature of GOD and Man, and the Relation between Him and us, and our Relation one to another, in Conformity to which consisteth the highest Perfection and Happiness of human Nature, and may therefore be called the <HI>Religion</HI> of the <HI>End</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. <HI>Scott,</HI> P. I.</NOTE>, and also the Chief of those subordinate Duties subservient thereunto, which may be called the <HI>Religion</HI> of <HI>the Means:</HI> I shall now conclude, by giving a very short Summary of <HI>revealed Religi∣on,</HI> and shew the Connection between them and CHRISTIANITY, or the Religion of the <HI>Mediator,</HI> which is to be considered as the great infallible Means of our Instruction and Refor∣mation, for begetting, improving and perfecting in us all the Virtues of an honest Heart, and a
<PB N="91" REF="006859_0224_102AACE1C7761090"/>
good Life, and for ascertaining to us the Favour of GOD, and a blessed Immortality; to which it is so admirably subservient, that it should seem the greatest Inconsistency imaginable for a Man to be a real Friend to what is called Natural Re∣ligion or Morality, and at the same time not to adhere firmly to the Christian System.</P>
<P N="2">§ 2. FOR altho' these great Truths and Du∣ties, appear thus evident and demonstrable, in the Nature of Things, to any serious, thinking and considerate Person, who hath had Means of In∣formation, and Leisure to give a proper Atten∣tion to them; and many wise Men in the Hea∣then World (doubtless much assisted in these En∣quiries, by Instructions handed down to them by Tradition, from the first Parents and intermediate Ancestors of Mankind) have made very great Proficiency in these Speculations; yet it must be allowed, that so many are the Cares and Busi∣nesses, and the Pleasures and Amusements of this Life, which do unavoidably engage the Attention of the general Rate and Bulk of Mankind, that it cannot be expected they should ever attain to the distinct practical Knowledge of them, in their present Condition, without Instruction from a∣bove. So that an express Revelation is highly ex∣pedient, and indeed extremely necessary, as a Means in order to render Men in any tolerable Measure capable of answering the End of their Being; especially if it be considered, that no Phi∣losopher or Teacher, without a sufficiently attest∣ed Commission from GOD, even if he could discover all these <HI>Laws of Nature,</HI> could have Authority to enjoin them, as being what indeed they are, the <HI>Laws of GOD,</HI> without which they would make but a small Impression on them;
<PB N="92" REF="006859_0225_102AACE5402F8BE0"/>
and that this would be the most direct and com∣pendious Method of answering this Purpose<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Lactant.</HI> L. III. C. 26, 27.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="3">§ 3. AND indeed, considering that the Wis∣dom, Power and Goodness of the DEITY are such, as could not fail to enable and dispose Him to do all that was fit and necessary to con∣duct the Creatures which He had made (and would not desert) to that Happiness which was the End of their Being; I cannot doubt but that even the first Parents of Mankind, upon their first coming into Being, and in their State of In∣nocence, being then perfect Strangers to every Thing about them, and having every Thing to learn that related to their Well-being, must, in some Manner or other, have been taught by GOD himself, many Things relating to Food, Language, the Origin of Things, Philosophy and Religion, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (at least so much as was ne∣cessary for them to begin with) in order to their Well-being and Happiness. And when they had sinned against him, and fallen into a State of Mortality and Misery, it is natural to conclude, from the same Goodness and Compassion of the <HI>Father of Mercies,</HI> that he would take Pity of them, and teach, them (what they could no otherwise know) in what Method, and upon what Terms, they should be pardoned and re∣stored to his Favour, and how they should con∣duct for the Future, so as to be accepted with him, and restored to that Immortality which they had lost. All this is also very agreeable to the most ancient authentick Account we have of the Origin of Mankind.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="93" REF="006859_0226_102AACE79C945C48"/>§ 4. FROM which Account rightly under∣stood<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Mr. <HI>Hutchinson</HI>'s Works, or Lord Chief Justice <HI>Forbes</HI>'s Thoughts concerning Religion, which deserve to be well considered.</NOTE>, it appears, that as GOD had, very probably before the Fall, made the Garden of <HI>Eden</HI> an Emblem and Means of Instruction, both in Philosophy and Religion, and explained his <HI>necessary Existence</HI> and Personality in a <HI>coessential Trinity,</HI> signified by the divine Names, and re∣presented by the <HI>Sun</HI> as an Emblem, in his three∣fold Condition of <HI>Fire, Light</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> (He being to the intellectual World analogous to what the Sun is to the Sensible) so it is no less probable that he set up the <HI>Cherubims</HI> with the <HI>Flame</HI> and <HI>Sword</HI> as Hieroglyphics or Emblems of the Gospel, to teach Man, after the Fall, how to obtain Pardon, and regain the Immortality he had lost, which was represented by the Tree of Life; by instructing Him, not only in the Knowledge of the <HI>Trinity, Father, Son</HI> and <HI>Ho∣ly Ghost,</HI> but also of the <HI>Incarnation, Sacrifice, Satisfaction</HI> and <HI>Intercession</HI> of the <HI>Son</HI> of GOD, in the Fulness of Time to appear as the <HI>Instruc∣tor, Redeemer, Lord</HI> and <HI>Judge</HI> of Mankind, and of the Presence and Assistance of the <HI>Spirit</HI> of GOD for our Renovation and Sanctification. At least this is certain, that <HI>Sacrifice</HI> must have been then instituted as an emblematical Means of Reconciliation, and Hopes were given of a glorious Person, who should recover them from the Mischief into which the Tempter had sedu∣ced them <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vide Bishop <HI>Sherlock</HI> on Prophecy, and <HI>Shuckford</HI>'s Connection.</NOTE>; all which were doubtless much more particularly explained to them, than is accounted
<PB N="94" REF="006859_0227_102AACE9525632D8"/>
for in the very short History of the Fall; and no Account can be given how human Sacrifices, Polytheism and Idolatry could have obtained a∣mong Mankind, but upon Supposition of their being so many Corruptions of these original Em∣blems and Instructions, as Popery is of Christi∣anity. And as the Law of <HI>Moses</HI> was▪ doubt∣less, a Revival of these original Symbols and In∣structions, with Laws to guard against those Cor∣ruptions; so GOD, by the Spirit of Prophecy, explained more and more in the following Ages the spiritual Meaning of those Types, and the great Design He had in View, and had in some Measure discovered: And there manifestly ap∣pears, in the Whole, to have been one uniform consistent Scheme carried on, from the Beginning downward, aiming all along at one End, <HI>viz.</HI> The Instruction and Reformation of Mankind; their Restoration to the divine Favour, and a sincere and persevering Obedience to the original Law of their Nature, finally to issue in their in∣tire Perfection and Happiness <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vide Bishop <HI>Butler</HI>'s Analogy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="5">§ 5. ACCORDINGLY (1.) we have abundant Evi∣dence, both from Prophecy and Miracles, and undoubted Tradition ever since, That GOD (after such a Series of introductory Instructions, Revelations and Institutions from the Beginning) did at length send a glorious Person into our Nature, whom He declared to be His own SON, and who, being <HI>truly GOD of GOD,</HI> had in∣expressible Glory with Him, even from Eternity, before the World was, being <HI>the Brightness of His Glory, and the express Image of His Person,</HI> and by whom He visibly displayed and exerted <HI>His Almighty Wisdom and Authority,</HI> in the Crea∣tion
<PB N="95" REF="006859_0228_102AACEB7853E048" MS="y"/>
and Government of the World, and <HI>in whom dwelt the Fulness of the Godhead</HI> bodily in His in∣carnate State: This glorious Person GOD sent among us, to act as a <HI>Mediator</HI> between Him and us: For as we are Sinners, it was very fit He should treat with us by a Mediator; and as we are Men, it was no less proper, that He should do it by one that should appear in our own Na∣ture, and converse familiarly among us, that he might the better instruct us by his Example as well as his Precepts.</P>
<P N="6">§ 6. AND (2.) as this was fit in itself, so ac∣cordingly the Fact was, That in His incarnate State, He abundantly proved by his Miracles, that He was indeed <HI>a Teacher come from GOD;</HI> and, being cloathed with divine Authority, He taught us all the great Principles of moral Truth and Duty, above demonstrated, much more clear∣ly than they had been generally known before, together with others meerly depending on Reve∣lation and Institution, relating to His Mediation and the New Covenant; and that in a Manner and Language, admirably suited to make the strongest Impressions upon the Minds of Men, not only of the more thinking, but even of the general Rate and lower Sort of the human Kind; and enjoined them upon us, under the most weighty Sanctions, and affecting Considerations, as the Will and Law of GOD concerning us; and at the same time set us a most amiable Ex∣ample, that <HI>we should follow His Steps.</HI></P>
<P N="7">§ 7. AND (3.) as it was very necessary, that we should be strongly affected with a Sense of the Heinousness of Sin, as the most effectual Means to bring us to Repentance, and at the same time have sufficient Security for Pardon, upon our Re∣pentance,
<PB N="96" REF="006859_0229_102AACEF6ACD69A8"/>
it pleased GOD to appoint that His blessed SON incarnate (freely submitting to it) should die for both these Purposes; that He should die for us, a <HI>Sacrifice</HI> for the Atone∣ment of our Sins, and to set before us an Em∣blem of the Greatness of our Guilt, and the Hei∣nousness of our Sins, in order the more effectually to induce us to repent of them, and forsake them; and to purchase and ascertain to us Pardon and Acceptance, upon our Repentance and Re∣formation; which merciful Purpose and Intention He had exhibited from the Beginning by the In∣stitution of Sacrifices. Accordingly the blessed JESUS was graciously pleased to submit to a most painful and ignominious Death for our Sakes, <HI>making His Soul an Offering for our Sins,</HI> as the true Antitype of all the ancient Sacrifices (in which He had been exhibited, as the <HI>Lamb slain from the Foundation of the World.</HI>) And thereupon, in Virtue of the Right thereby ac∣quired, He did, in GOD's Name, promise and ascertain, thro' His Merits and Mediation, <HI>Par∣don</HI> to our sincere <HI>Repentance</HI> and <HI>Faith</HI> in Him, and the <HI>Acceptance</HI> of our faithful, tho' very weak Endeavours, to yield a constant and perse∣vering Obedience to all His holy Laws for the Time to come.</P>
<P N="8">§ 8. AND (4.) because of our great Weak∣ness and Inability to repent, believe and obey, without GOD's Help, amid so many Temp∣tations to the contrary; He hath also, for CHRIST's Sake, sent His <HI>Holy</HI> SPIRIT (by whom He hath always immediately exerted His <HI>Almighty Will and Power,</HI> in the Creation, Pre∣servation and Government of the World) and promised His gracious <HI>Assistance</HI> to our ear∣nest
<PB N="97" REF="006859_0230_102AACF0F5E42098"/>
Prayers and Endeavours, to enable us to withstand the Temptations that lie in our Way, to mortify our Lusts and vicious Habits, and to comply with all the Duties incumbent upon us: Who, accordingly, is ever ready to assist us in all our honest and faithful Endeavours, and to ren∣der them effectual for the Renovation of our Souls, and to enable us to <HI>bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance,</HI> even all the Fruits of a sincere, universal and persevering Obedience to the Gospel.</P>
<P N="9">§ 9. And (5.) SINCE as Things now stand, we cannot have much else in View here, besides a short and uncertain Life, attended with many Calamities, and issuing in the <HI>Death</HI> or Dissoluti∣on of our Bodies; and should otherwise have been generally attended with much Darkness and Uncertainty about a future Life; CHRIST hath moreover, by his Sufferings and <HI>Death</HI> in our Behalf, taken away the Curse and Sting of our Calamities and Dissolution, and turned them into a Blessing, and made them a Means of pro∣moting our greatest Good; and hath by his triumphant <HI>Resurrection</HI> and <HI>Ascension,</HI> opened to us the glorious Views of a blessed <HI>Immortality</HI> both in Body and Soul, and ascertained to us an <HI>eternal Life</HI> of unspeakable Happiness to be be∣stowed upon us, in Consequence of our final Perseverance in Well-doing conformable to his Instructions.</P>
<P N="10">§ 10. AND (6.) in the mean Time, and in order to qualify us therefor; as we could not, without Instruction from above, be well assured what <HI>Worship</HI> and Service would be acceptable to GOD, it was very needful that CHRIST should teach us how to <HI>worship</HI> and adore him ac∣ceptably,
<PB N="98" REF="006859_0231_102AACF33772F628"/>
even <HI>in Spirit and in Truth.</HI> For as GOD hath been pleased to derive down all his Blessings and Favours to us thro' the Mediation of his <HI>blessed Son,</HI> and by the Influence of his <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> so (as these Relations demand cor∣respondent Duties) it is fit, as he hath taught us, that all our Worship and Service, our Prayers and Praises, and all our Hopes of Acceptance, should be offered up to Him, in Dependence on the Influence and Assistance of his Holy Spirit, and through the Merits and Mediation of his dear Son, who is the very <HI>Truth (the Way, the Truth and the Life)</HI> as the Condition of their ob∣taining Favour and Acceptance with him.</P>
<P N="11">§ 11. AND (7, and <HI>lustly</HI>) as every Thing that concerneth the Weal of Mankind is best pro∣moted by social Combinations; so GOD hath by his Son JESUS CHRIST, the great <HI>Messenger of his Covenant,</HI> appointed that we should jointly combine and unite together in promoting our Happiness, which is the great End of our Being, and particularly that we should live in the con∣stant Exercise of <HI>social Religion</HI> for that Purpose. He hath therefore instituted <HI>Baptism,</HI> as a Rite of our Admission into this Society, to represent and oblige us to all Purity and Holiness in Heart and Life, and to seal to us the <HI>great and precious Pro∣mises</HI> of the Covenant of Grace, and the <HI>holy Eucharist,</HI> as a further Means to ratify and con∣firm them, and to keep up in our Minds a lively Sense of His Sufferings and Death, and of the mighty Obligations we are under, from His dy∣ing Love to us, to be faithful to Him who <HI>died for us,</HI> and <HI>arose again,</HI> and who is the great <HI>Au∣thor and Finisher of our Faith;</HI> and moreover to persevere in Love and Unity, as Brethren and
<PB N="99" REF="006859_0232_102AACF6C3895D70"/>
Fellow Members of that holy Community of all good Men and Angels, whereof he is the Head and Lord. And as he would have us live in the constant Use of these Means for the promoting in us all the Virtues of a holy Life, which con∣tribute to our final Happiness, he hath appointed an <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Men</HI> to administer these sacred Rites, and to preside in the Exercise of this social Reli∣gion and Worship, and to explain and inculcate the <HI>Divine Philosophy</HI> which he hath taught us, in order to qualify and prepare us for that eternal Happiness which he hath provided and ascertained to us; so that we are to consider the Church and publick Worship as the School of CHRIST, wherein immortal Spirits cloath'd with Flesh, are to be trained and bred up as Candidates for eter∣nal Glory.</P>
<P N="12">§ 12. NOW therefore, all those who do firmly believe all the great Truths of this <HI>holy Religion,</HI> whether <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>revealed, i. e.</HI> whether found∣ed in Nature, or meerly depending on Revelation; and who under the Influence of them, do by <HI>Faith</HI> look for Assistance and Acceptance, only through his Mediation, and in the Method which he hath prescribed; and who, conformable to this holy Discipline of Christianity, do heartily <HI>repent</HI> and forsake their Sins, and return to their Duty, and faithfully live and act in all their Be∣haviour, both towards GOD and Man, from a Sense of Duty and Gratitude to GOD, their great Creator and Benefactor, and to JESUS CHRIST, their great Mediator, Law-giver and Judge, and persevere in their Obedience, <HI>faith∣ful to the Death.</HI> All these are said to be true <HI>Christians;</HI> and, even while they continue here,
<PB N="100" REF="006859_0233_102AACF849B63C90"/>
they belong to that heavenly Community which is called His <HI>Kingdom,</HI> whereof He is the Head, Lord and <HI>King,</HI> the great Vice-gerent of <HI>GOD the Father,</HI> and shall, through His Merits and Mediation, be accepted in Him, and be incon∣ceivably happy with Him, in His glorious King∣dom in the Life to come.</P>

O THOU Almighty BEING, on whom dependeth the Existence of the World, and every Creature therein, and by whom all Things are governed and conducted to the several Ends of their Being, according to the various Natures which Thou hast given them: By whose good Providence I have been brought into Being, and most kindly preserved and pro∣vided for, from the Beginning of my Life to this Moment, and enjoyed many undeserved Advan∣tages and Favours, with regard both to my Well-being in this Life, and my everlasting Happiness in the Life to come; and especially the inestimable Advantages of Thy Holy Gospel, made known to us in Thy Name, by Thy blessed Son JESUS CHRIST, and all that He hath taught, and done, and suffered for us; I beseech Thee graciously to accept of my most grateful Sense and Acknow∣ledgment of all Thy Bounty and Beneficence towards me. <HI>Bless</HI> JEHOVAH, <HI>O my Soul, and all that is within me, bless His holy Name: Bless</HI> JEHOVAH, <HI>O my Soul, and forget not all His Be∣nefits: Who forgiveth all thine Iniquities, and healeth all thine Infirmities: Who redeemeth thy Life from Destruction, and crowneth thee with lov∣ing Kindness and tender Mercies!

And I do most earnestly beg the Forgiveness of my many Offences, through Thy infinite Mercies in Thy Son JESUS CHRIST, and that Thou wilt for His Sake, deliver me from the evil Consequences of all my Transgres∣sions and Follies. And I humbly beseech the Assistance of Thy Holy Spirit, to endue me with such Dispositions and Powers, as may carry me innocently and safely through all future Trials; and to enable me upon all Occasions, from a Sense of Duty to Thee, my GOD, to behave myself conformable to Thy most holy Laws, which are indeed the Laws of Reason and Na∣ture, in all Wisdom, Probity and Virtue, and in the faithful Discharge of all the Duties of Tem∣perance, Piety and Benevolence, with a humble Dependence upon thy infinite Wisdom, Power and Goodness, and under a lively and habitual Sense of thy All-seeing Eye, and the Account I am to give of myself to Thee.</P>
