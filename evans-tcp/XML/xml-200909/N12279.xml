<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><L>"What's in the name of <HI>LORD</HI> that I should fear,</L>
<L>"To bring my grievance to the public ear.</L>
<BIBL><HI>CHURCHILL.</HI></BIBL></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>UNIVERSAL empire is the prerogative of a writer. His concerns are with all mankind, and though he cannot command their obedience, he can assign them their duty. The Republic of Letters is more ancient than monarchy, and of far higher character in the world than the vassal court of Britain; he that re∣bels against reason is a real rebel, but he that in defence of reason, rebels against tyranny, has a better title to "DE∣FENDER OF THE FAITH" than George the Third.</P>
<P>AS a military man your Lordship may hold out the sword of war, and call it the "ULTIMA RATIO RE∣GUM:" <HI>The last Reason of Kings;</HI> we in return can show you the sword of justice, and call it, <Q>The best Scourge of Tyrants.</Q> The first of these two may threaten, or even frighten, for a while, and cast a sickly languor over an insulted people, but reason will soon recover the de∣bauch, and restore them again to tranquil fortitude. Your Lordship, I find, has now commenced author and pub∣lished a proclamation; I too have published a crisis; as they stand, they are the antipodes of each other; both can∣not rise at once, and one of them must descend: And so quick is the revolution of things, that your Lordship's performance, I see, has already fallen many degrees from its first place, and is now just visible on the edge of the political horizon.</P>
<P>IT is surprising to what pitch of infatuation blind folly and obstinacy will carry mankind, and your Lordship's drowsy proclamation is a proof that it does not even quit them in their sleep. Perhaps you thought America too was taking a nap, and therefore, chose, like satan to Eve, to whisper the delusion softly, lest you should awaken her.
<PB N="11" REF="015493_0003_0F998654A01AC3E8"/>
This Continent, Sir, is too extensive to sleep all at once, and too watchful, even in its slumbers, not to startle at the unhallowed foot of an invader. You may issue your proclamations, and welcome, for we have learned to <HI>"re∣verence ourselves"</HI> and scorn the insulting ruffian that em∣ploys you. America for your deceased brother's sake would gladly have shown you respect, and it is a new aggravation to her feelings that <HI>Howe</HI> should be forgetful, and raise his sword against those, who at their own charge raised a mo∣nument to his brother. But your master has commanded, and you have not enough of nature left to refuse. Surely! there must be something strangely degenerating in the love of monarchy, that can so completely wear a man down to an ingrate, and make him proud to lick the dust that kings have trod upon. A few more years, should you survive them, will bestow on you the title of an old man, and in some hour of future reflection you may probably find the fitness of Woolsey's despairing penitence, <Q>Had I served my God as faithfully as I have served my king, he would not thus have forsaken me in my old age.</Q></P>
<P>THE character you appear to us in is truly ridiculous. Your friends, the Tories, announced your coming with high descriptions of your unlimited powers; but your pro∣clamation has given them the lie, by shewing you to be a Commissioner without authority. Had your powers been ever so great, they were nothing to us, farther than we pleased; because we had the same right which other na∣tions had, to do what we thought was best. "THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA," will sound as pompously in the world or in history as <HI>"The Kingdom of Great-Britain;"</HI> The character of <HI>General Washington</HI> will fill a page with as much lustre as that of <HI>Lord Howe;</HI> and the <HI>Congress</HI> have as much right to command the <HI>King and Parliament</HI> of London, to desist from legislation, as <HI>they</HI> or <HI>you</HI> have to command the Congress. Only suppose how laughable such an edict would appear from us, and then, in that merry mood, do but turn the tables upon yourself, and you will see how your proclamation is received here. Having thus placed you in a proper position in which you may have a full view of folly and learn to despise it, I hold up to you, for that purpose, the following quotation from your own lunarian proclamation "And We (Lord Howe and General Howe) "do command, (and in his Ma∣jesty's
<PB N="12" REF="015493_0004_0F998657390BF930"/>
name forsooth) <Q>all such persons as are assembled to∣gether under the name of general or provincial Con∣gresses, Committees, Conventions, or other Associa∣tions, by whatever name or names known or distin∣guished, to desist and cease from all such treasonable actings and doings.</Q></P>
<P>YOU introduce your proclamation by referring to your declarations of the 14th of July and 19th of September. In the last of these, you sunk yourself below the character of a private gentleman. That I may not seem to accuse you unjustly I shall state the circumstance: By a verbal invita∣tion of yours communicated to Congress by General Sul∣livan, then a prisoner on his parole, you signified your desire of conferring with some members of that body as private gentlemen. It was beneath the dignity of the Ame∣rican Congress to pay any regard to a message that at best was but a genteel affront, and had too much of the ministerial complexion of tampering with private per∣sons; and which might probably have been the case, had the gentlemen who were deputed on that business, possessed that easy kind of virtue which an English courtier is so truly distinguished by. Your request however was com∣plied with, for honest men are naturally more tender of their civil than their political fame. The interview ended as every sensible man thought it would; for your Lordship knows, as well as the writer of the Crisis, that it is im∣possible for the king of England to promise the repeal, or even the revisal, of any acts of parliament; wherefore, on your part, you had nothing to say, more than to request, in the room of demanding, the entire surrender of the Conti∣nent; and then, if that was complied with, to promise that the inhabitants should escape with their lives. This was the upshot of the conference. You informed the conferees that you were two months in soliciting these powers. We ask, what powers? for as Commissioner you have none. If you mean the power of pardoning, it is an oblique proof that your master was determined to sacrifice all before him; and that you were two months in dissuading him from his purpose. Another evidence of his savage obstinacy! From your own account of the matter we may justly draw these two conclusions; first, that you serve a monster; and se∣condly, that never was a commissioner sent on a more foolish errand than yourself. This plain language may per∣haps
<PB N="13" REF="015493_0005_0F99865824C86990"/>
sound uncoothly to an ear viciated by courtly refine∣ments; but words were made for use, and the fault lies in deserving them, or the abuse in applying them unfairly.</P>
<P>SOON after your return to New-York you published a very illiberal and unmanly hand bill against the Congress; for it was certainly stepping out of the line of common ci∣vility, first to screen your national pride by soliciting an interview with them as private gentlemen, and in the con∣clusion to endeavour to deceive the multitude by making an hand bill attack on the whole body of the Congress; you got them together under one name, and abused them under another. But the king you serve and the cause you sup∣port afford you so few instances of acting the gentleman, that out of pity to your situation the Congress pardoned the insult by taking no notice of it.</P>
<P>YOU say in that hand bill, <Q>that they, the Congress, disavowed every purpose for reconciliation not consonant with their extravagant and inadmissible claim of Inde∣pendence.</Q> Why, God bless me! what have you to do with our Independence? we ask no leave of yours to set it up; we ask no money of yours to support it; we can do better without your fleets and armies than with them; you may soon have enough to do to protect yourselves without being burthened with us. We are very willing to be at peace with you, to buy of you and sell to you, and, like young beginners in the world, to work for our own living; therefore, why do you put yourselves out of cash, when we know you cannot spare it, and we do not desire you to run into debt? I am willing, Sir, you should see your fol∣ly in every view I can place it, and for that reason descend sometimes to tell you in jest what I wish you to see in ear∣nest. But to be more serious with you, why do you say "their" Independence? To set you right, Sir, we tell you, that the Independency is <HI>ours</HI> not <HI>theirs.</HI> The Con∣gress were authorised by every State on the Continent to publish it to all the world, and in so doing are not to be considered as the inventors, but only as the heralds that proclaimed it, or the office from which the sense of the peo∣ple received a legal form; and it was as much as any or all their heads were worth, to have treated with you on the subject of submission under any name whatever. But we know the men in whom we have trusted; can England say the same of her parliament?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="015493_0006_0F99865882FCA218"/>I come now more particularly to your proclamation of the 30th of November last. Had you gained an entire con∣quest over all the armies of America, and then put forth a proclamation, offering (what you call) mercy, your conduct would have had some specious show of humanity; but to creep by surprise into a province, and there endeavour to terrify and seduce the inhabitants from their just al∣legiance to the rest by promises, which you neither meant nor were able to fulfil, is both cruel and unmanly: Cruel in its effects; because, unless you can keep all the ground you have marched over, how are you, in the words of your proclamation, to secure to your proselytes "the en∣joyment of their property?" What are to become either of your new adopted subjects, or your old friends the To∣ries, in Burlington, Bordentown, Trenton, Mountholly, and many other places, where you proudly lorded it for a few days, and then fled with the precipitation of a pursued thief? What, I say, are to become of those wretches? What are to become of those who went over to you from this city and State? What more can you say to them than <HI>"Shift for yourselves?"</HI> Or what more can they hope for than to wander like vagabonds over the face of the earth? You may now tell them to take their leave of America and all that once was theirs. Recommend them, for consolation, to your master's court; there perhaps they may make a shift to live on the scraps of some dangling parasite, and choose companions among thousands like themselves. A traitor is the foulest fiend on earth!</P>
<P>IN a political sense we ought to thank you for thus be∣queathing estates to the Continent; we shall soon, at this rate, be able to carry on a war without expence, and grow rich by the ill policy of Lord Howe and the generous de∣fection of the Tories. Had you set your foot into this city you would have bestowed estates upon us which we never thought of, by bringing forth traitors we were unwilling to suspect. But these men, you'll say, <HI>"are his majesty's most faithful subjects;"</HI> let that honour then be all their fortune, and let his majesty take them to himself.</P>
<P>I am now thoroughly disgusted with them; they live in un∣grateful case and bend their whole minds to mischief. It seems as if GOD had given them over to a spirit of infidelity, and that they are open to conviction in no other line but that of punishment. It is time to have done with tarring, feathering,
<PB N="15" REF="015493_0007_0F99865934881308"/>
carting, and taking securities for their future good behaviour; every sensible man must feel a conscious shame at seeing a poor fellow hawked for a show about the streets, when it is known that he is only the tool of some principal villain, biased into his offence by the force of false reasoning, or bribed thereto through sad necessity. We dishonour our∣selves by attacking such trifling characters, while greater ones are suffered to escape; 'tis our duty to find <HI>them</HI> out, and their proper punishment would be to exile them from the Continent for ever. The circle of them is not so great as some imagine; the influence of a few have tainted many who are not naturally corrupt. A continual circulation of lies among those who are not much in the way of hearing them contradicted, will in time pass for truth; and the crime lies not in the believer but the inventor. I am not for declaring war against every man that appears not so warm as myself: Difference of constitution, temper, habit of speaking and many other things will go a great way in fixing the outward character of a man, yet simple honesty may remain at bottom. Some men have naturally a military turn, and can brave hardships and the risk of life with a chearful face; others have not, no slavery appears to them so great as the fatigue of arms, and no terror so powerful as that of personal danger: What can we say? We cannot alter nature, neither ought we to punish the son because the father begot him in a cowardly mood. However, I believe most men have more courage than they know of, and that a little at first is enough to begin with. I knew the time when I thought that the whistling of a cannon ball would have frightened me almost to death; but I have since tried it, and find I can stand it with as little discomposure, and (I believe) with a much easier conscience than your Lord∣ship. The same dread would return to me again were I in your situation, for my solemn belief of your cause is, that it is hellish and damnable, and under that conviction every thinking man's heart <HI>must</HI> fail him.</P>
<P>FROM a concern that a good cause should be dishonoured by the least disunion among us, I said in my former paper, No. 1. <Q>That should the enemy now be expelled, I wish, with all the sincerity of a Christian, that the names of Whig and Tory might never more be mentioned;</Q> but there is a knot of men among us of such a venomous cast that they will not admit even one's good wishes to act in
<PB N="16" REF="015493_0008_0F998659EB25A398"/>
their favour. Instead of rejoicing that Heaven had, as it were, providentially preserved this city from plunder and destruction, by delivering so great a part of the enemy into our hands with so little effusion of blood, they stubbornly affected to disbelieve it till within an hour, nay half an hour, of the prisoners arriving: And the Quakers put forth a testimony, dated the 20th of December, signed <HI>"John Pem∣berton,"</HI> declaring their attachment to the British govern∣ment.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I have ever been careful of charging offences upon whole societies of men, but as the paper referred to is put forth by an unknown set of men, who claim to themselves the right of re∣presenting the whole; and while the whole society of Quakers admit its validity by a silent acknowledgment, it is impossible that any distinction can be made by the public; and the more so because the New-York paper, of the 30th of December, printed by permission of our enemies, says that <Q>the Quakers begin to speak openly of their attachment to the British constitution.</Q> We are certain that we have many friends among them, and wish to know them.</NOTE> These men are continually harping on the great sin of <HI>our</HI> bearing arms, but the king of Britain may lay waste the world in blood and famine, and they, poor fallen souls, have nothing to say.</P>
<P>IN some future paper I intend to distinguish between the different kind of persons who have been denominated <HI>Tories;</HI> for this I am clear in, that all are not so who have been called so, nor all men Whigs who were once thought so; and as I mean not to conceal the name of any true friend when there shall be occasion to mention him, neither will I that of an enemy who ought to be known, let his rank, station or religion be what it may. Much pains have been taken by some to set your Lordship's private character in an amiable light, but as it has chiefly been done by men who know nothing about you, and who are no ways remarkable for their attachment to us, we have no just authority for be∣lieving it. George the Third was imposed upon us by the same arts, but TIME, at length, has done him justice, and the same fate may probably attend your Lordship. Your avowed purpose here, is to kill, conquer, plunder, pardon and enslave; and the ravages of your army through the Jersies have been marked with as much barbarism as if you had openly professed yourself the prince of ruffians; not even the appearance of humanity has been preserved either on the march or the retreat of your troops; no general or∣der,
<PB N="17" REF="015493_0009_0F99865AA7A4D1A8"/>
that I could ever learn, has ever been issued to prevent or even forbid your troops from robbery wherever they came, and the only instance of justice, if it can be called such, which has distinguished you for impartiality, is, that you treated and plundered all alike; what could not be carried away have been destroyed, and mohogony furniture have been deliberately laid on the fire for fuel, rather than the men should be fatigued with cutting wood.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">As some people may doubt the truth of such wanton de∣struction, I think it necessary to inform, that one of the people called Quakers, who lives at Trenton, gave me this information at the house of Mr. Michael Hutchinson (one of the same pro∣fession) who lives near to Trenton ferry, on the Pennsylvania side; Mr. Hutchinson being present.</NOTE> There was a time when the Whigs confided much in your supposed can∣dour, and the Tories rested themselves on your favour; the experiments have now been made, and failed; and every town, nay every cottage, in the Jersies, where your arms have been, is a testimony against you. How you may rest under this sacrifice of character I know not, but this I know, that you sleep and rise with the daily curses of thousands upon you; perhaps the misery which the Tories have suf∣fered by your proffered mercy may give them some claim to their country's pity, and be in the end the best favour you could show them.</P>
<P>IN a folio general order book belonging to Colonel Rohl's battalion, taken at Trenton, and now in the possession of the Council of Safety for this State, the following barbarous order is frequently repeated, <Q>His Excellency the <HI>COM∣MANDER IN CHIEF</HI> orders, that all inhabitants which shall be found with arms, not having an officer with them, shall be immediately taken and hung up.</Q> How many you may thus have privately sacrificed we know not, and the account can only be settled in another world. Your treatment of pri∣soners, in order to distress them to enlist into your infernal service, is not to be equalled by any instance in Europe. Yet this is the humane Lord Howe and his brother, whom the Tories and their three quarter kindred the Quakers, or some of them at least, have been holding up for patterns of justice and mercy!</P>
<P>A bad cause will ever be supported by bad means and bad men, and whoever will be at the pains of examining strictly into things, will find that one and the same spirit
<PB N="18" REF="015493_0010_0F99865B65ACAB28"/>
of oppression and impiety, more or less, governs through your whole party in both countries: Not many days ago I accidently fell in company with a person of this city, noted for espousing your cause, and on my remarking to him, "that it appeared clear to me, by the late providential turn of affairs, that GOD Almighty was visibly on our side," he replied, "We care nothing for that, you may have HIM, and welcome; if we have but enough of the devil on our side we shall do." However carelessly this might be spoken matters not, 'tis still the insensible principle that directs all your conduct, and will at last most assuredly deceive and ruin you.</P>
<P>IF ever a nation was mad and foolish, blind to its own interest and bent on its own destruction, it is Britain. There are such things as national sins, and though the punishment of individuals may be reserved to <HI>another</HI> world, national pu∣nishment can only be inflicted in <HI>this</HI> world. Britain, as a nation, is in my inmost belief the greatest and most un∣grateful offender against GOD on the face of the whole earth: Bless'd with all the commerce she could wish for, and furnished by a vast extension of dominion with the means of civilizing both the eastern and western world, she has made no other use of both than proudly to idolize her own "Thunder," and rip up the bowels of whole countries for what she could get;—like Alexander she has made war her sport, and inflicted misery for prodagality sake. The blood of India is not yet repaid, nor the wretchedness of Africa yet requitted. Of late she has enlarged her list of national cruelties by her butcherly destruction of the Ca∣ribbs of St. Vincents, and in returning an answer by the sword to the meek prayer for <HI>"Peace, Liberty and Safety."</HI> These are serious things; and whatever a foolish tyrant, a debauched court, a trafficing legislature or a blinded people may think, the national account with Heaven must some day or other be settled: All countries have sooner or later been called to their reckoning; the proudest empires have sunk when the balance was struck; and Britain, like an in∣dividual penitent, must undergo her day of sorrow, and the sooner it happens to her the better. As I wish it over, I wish it to come, but withal wish that it may be as light as possible.</P>
<P>PERHAPS your Lordship has no taste for serious things; by your connexions in England I should suppose not:
<PB N="19" REF="015493_0011_0F99865C3AD81A28"/>
Therefore I shall drop this part of the subject, and take it up in a line in which you will better understand me.</P>
<P>BY what means, may I ask, do you expect to conquer America? If you could not effect it in the summer when our army was less than yours, nor in the winter when we had none, how are you to do it? In point of generalship you have been outwitted, and in point of fortitude outdone; your advantages turn out to your loss, and show us that it is in our power to ruin you by gifts: Like a game of drafts we can move out of <HI>one</HI> square to let you come in, in order that we may afterwards take two or three for one; and as we can always keep a double corner for ourselves, we can always prevent a total defeat. You cannot be so insensible as not to see that we have two to one the advantage of you, because we conquer by a drawn game, and you lose by it. Burgoyne might have taught your Lordship this knowledge; he has been long a student in the doctrine of chances.</P>
<P>I have no other idea of conquering countries than by subduing the armies which defend them: Have you done this, or can you do this? If you have not, it would be civil in you to let your proclamations alone for the present; other∣wise, you will ruin more Tories by your grace and favour than you will Whigs by your arms.</P>
<P>WERE you to obtain possession of this city, you would not know what to do with it more than to plunder it. To hold it, in the manner you hold New-York, would be an additional dead weight upon your hands; and if a general conquest is your object, you had better be without the city than with it. When you have defeated all our armies, the cities will fall into your hands of themselves; but to creep into them in the manner you got into Princetown, Tren∣ton, &amp;c. is like robbing an orchard in the night before the fruit be ripe, and running away in the morning. Your ex∣periment in the Jersies is sufficient to teach you that you have something more to do than barely to get into other people's houses; and your new converts, to whom you pro∣mised all manner of protection, and seduced into new guilt by pardoning them from their former virtues, must begin to have a very contemptible opinion both of your power and your policy. Your authority in the Jersies is now reduced to the small circle which your army occupies, and your pro∣clamation is no where else seen unless it be to be laughed at. The mighty subduers of the Continent are retreated in∣to
<PB N="20" REF="015493_0012_0F99865CE38F9B70"/>
a nutshell, and the proud forgivers of our sins are fled from those they came to pardon; and all this at a time when they were dispatching vessel after vessel to England with the great news of every day. In short, you have managed your Jersey expedition so very dexterously that the dead only are conquerors, because none will dispute the ground with them.</P>
<P>IN all the wars you have formerly been concerned in, you had only armies to contend with; in this case you have both an army and a country to combat with. In former wars, the countries followed the fate of their capitals; Ca∣nada fell with Quebec, and Minorca with Port Mahon or St. Philips; by subduing those, the conquerors opened a way into, and became masters of the country: here it is otherwise; if you get possession of a city here, you are obliged to shut yourselves up in it, and can make no other use of it, than to spend your country's money in. This is all the advantage you have drawn from New-York; and you would draw less from Philadelphia, because it requires more force to keep it, and is much farther from the sea. A pret∣ty figure you and the Tories would cut in this city, with a river full of ice, and a town full of fire; for the immediate consequence of your getting here would be, that you would be cannonaded out again and the Tories be obliged to make good the damage; and this, sooner or later, will be the fate of New-York.</P>
<P>I wish to see the city saved, not so much from military as from natural motives. 'Tis the hiding-place of women and children, and Lord Howe's proper business is with our armies. When I put all the circumstances together which ought to be taken, I laugh at your notion of conquering America. Because you lived in a little country where an army might run over the whole in a few days, and where a single company of soldiers might put a multitude to the route, you expected to find it the same here. It is plain that you brought over with you all the narrow notions you were bred up with, and imagined that a proclamation in the king's name was to do great things; but Englishmen always travel for knowledge, and your Lordship, I hope, will re∣turn, if you return at all, much wiser than you came.</P>
<P>WE may be surprised by events we did not expect, and in that interval of recollection you may gain some tempora∣ry advantage: Such was the case a few weeks ago, but we soon ripen again into reason, collect our strength, and while
<PB N="21" REF="015493_0013_0F99865DA949EE58"/>
you are preparing for a triumph we came upon you with a defeat. Such it has been, and such it would be were you to try it an hundred times over. Were you to garrison the places you might march over, in order to secure their sub∣jection, (for remember you can do it by no other means) your army would be like a stream of water running to nothing. By the time you reached from New-York to Virginia you would be reduced to a string of drops not capable of hang∣ing together; while we, by retreating from State to State, like a river turning back upon itself, would acquire strength in the same proportion as you lost it, and in the end be ca∣pable of overwhelming you. The country in the mean time would suffer, but 'tis a day of suffering, and we ought to expect it. What we contend for is worthy the affliction we may go through. If we get but bread to eat, and any kind of rayment to put on, we ought, not only to be contented, but thankful. More than <HI>that</HI> we ought not to look for, and less than <HI>that</HI> Heaven has not yet suffered us to want. He that would sell his Birthright for a little <HI>salt,</HI> is as worthless as he who sold it for <HI>porridge</HI> without salt. And he that would part with it for a gay coat, or a <HI>plain</HI> coat, ought for ever to be a slave in buff. What are salt, su∣gar and finery to the inestimable blessings of "Liberty and Safety?" Or what are the inconveniencies of a few months to the tributary bondage of ages? The meanest peasant in America, bless'd with these sentiments, is a happy man com∣pared with a New-York Tory; he can eat his morsel with∣out repining, and when he has done, can sweeten it with a re∣past of wholesome air; he can take his child by the hand and bless it, without feeling the conscious shame of neglecting a parent's duty.</P>
<P>IN publishing these remarks I have several objects in view: On your part they are, to expose the folly of your pretended authority as a Commissioner; the wickedness of your cause in general; and the impossibility of your conquer∣ing us at any rate. On the part of the public my meaning is, to show them their true and solid interest; to encourage them to their own good, to remove the fears and falsities which bad men had spread and weak men had encouraged; and to ex∣cite in all men a love for union, and a chearfulness for duty.</P>
<P>I shall submit one more case to you respecting your con∣quest of this country, and then proceed to new observations:</P>

immediately to disperse, every man to his home, or where else he might be safe, and engage to re-assemble again on a certain future day; it is clear that you would then have no army to contend with, yet you would be as much at a loss in that case as you are now; you would be afraid to send your troops in parties over the Continent, either to disarm, or prevent us from assembling, lest they should not return; and while you kept them together, having no army of ours to dispute with, you could not call it a conquest; you might furnish out a pompous page in the London Gazette or the New-York paper, but when we returned at the appointed time, you would have the same work to do you had at first.</P>
<P>IT has been the folly of Britain to suppose herself more powerful than she really is, and by that means have arro∣gated to herself a rank in the world she is not entitled to; for more than this century past she has not been able to carry on a war without foreign assistance. In Marlborough's campaigns, and from that day to this, the number of Ger∣man troops and officers assisting her have been about equal with her own; ten thousand Hessians were sent to England last war to protect her from a French invasion; and she would have cut but a poor figure in her Canadian and West-Indian expeditions, had not America been lavish both of her money and men to help her along. The only instance in which she was engaged singly, that I can recollect, was against the rebellion in Scotland in forty-five and forty-six, and in that, out of three battles, she was twice beaten, till by thus reducing their numbers (as we shall yours) and taking a supply ship that was coming to Scotland with cloaths, arms and money (as we have often done) she was at last enabled to defeat them. England was never famous by land; her officers have generally been suspected of cowardice, have more of the air of a dancing-master than a soldier, and by the sample we have taken prisoners we be∣gin to give the preference to ourselves. Her strength of late has laid in her extravagance; but as her finances and her credit are now low, her sinews in that line begin to fail fast. As a nation she is the poorest in Europe; for were the whole kingdom, and all that is in it, to be put up to sale like the estate of a bankrupt, it would not fetch as much as she owes: Yet this thoughtless wretch must go to war, and with the avowed design too of making us beasts of burthen, to support her in riot and debauchery, and to assist her

afterwards in distressing those nations who are now our best friends. This ingratitude may suit a Tory, or the unchristian peevishness of a fallen Quaker, but none else.</P>
<P>'TIS the unhappy temper of the English to be pleased with any war, right or wrong, be it but successful; but they soon grow discontented with ill fortune, and it is an even chance that they are as clamorous for peace next summer, as the king and his mi∣nisters were for war last winter. In this natural view of things, your Lordship stands in a very ugly critical situation: Your whole character is staked upon your laurels; if they wither, you wither with them; if they flourish, you cannot live long to look at them; and at any rate, the black account hereafter is not far off. What lately appeared to us misfortunes, were only blessings in disguise; and the seeming advantages on your side have turned out to our profit. Even our loss of this city, as far as we can see, might be a principal gain to us: The more surface you spread over, the thinner you will be, and the easier wiped away; and our consolation under that apparent disaster would be, that the estates of the Tories would become securities for the repairs. In short, there is no old ground we can fail upon, but some new foundation rises again to support us. <Q>We have put, <HI>Sir,</HI> our hands to the plough, and cursed be he that looketh back.</Q></P>
<P>YOUR king, in his speech to parliament last spring, declared to them, <Q>That he had no doubt but the great force they had en∣abled him to send to America, would effectually reduce the rebelli∣ous Colonies.</Q> It has not, neither can it; but it has done just enough to lay the foundation of its own next year's ruin. You are sensible that you left England in a divided distracted state of politics, and, by the command you had here, you became a prin∣cipal prop in the court party; their fortunes rest on yours; by a single express you can fix their value with the public, and the degree to which their spirits shall rise or fall; they are in your hands as stock, and you have the secret of the ally with you. Thus situated and connected, you become the unintentional me∣chanical instrument of your own and their overthrow. The king and his ministers put conquest out of doubt, and the credit of both depended on the proof. To support them in the interim, it was necessary you should make the most of every thing; and we can tell by Hugh Gaine's New-York paper what the complexion of the London Gazette is. With such a list of victories the na∣tion cannot expect you will ask new supplies; and to confess your want of them, would give the lie to your triumphs, and im∣peach the king and his ministers of treasonable deception. If you make the necessary demand at home, your party sinks; if you make it not, you sink yourself; to ask it now is too late, and to ask it before was too soon, and unless it arrive quickly will be of no use. In short, the part you have to act, cannot be acted; and I am fully persuaded that all you have to trust to, is to do
<PB N="24" REF="015493_0016_0F99865FE4A64F18" MS="y"/>
the best you can with what force you have got, or little more. Though we have greatly excelled you in point of generalship and bravery of men, yet, as a people, we have not entered into the full soul of enterprize; for I, who know England and the dispo∣sition of the people well; am confident that it is easier for us to effect a revolution there, than you a conquest here: A few thou∣sand men landed in England with the declared design of de∣posing the present king, bringing his ministers to trial, and set∣ting up the duke of Gloucester in his stead, would assuredly carry their point, while you were groveling here ignorant of the mat∣ter. As I send all my papers to England, this, like COMMON SENSE, will find its way there; and though it may put one party on their guard, it will inform the other and the nation in gene∣ral of our design to help them.</P>
<P>THUS far, Sir, I have endeavoured to give you a picture of present affairs: You may draw from it what conclusions you please. I wish as well to the true prosperity of England as you can, but I consider <HI>Independence as America's natural Right and Interest,</HI> and never could see any real disservice it would be to Britain. If an English merchant receives an order and is paid for it, it signifies nothing to him who governs the country—This is my creed of politics. If I have any where expressed myself overwarmly, 'tis from a fixt immovable hatred I have, and ever had, to cruel men and cruel measures. I have likewise an aver∣sion to monarchy, as being too debasing to the dignity of man; but I never troubled others with my notions till very lately, nor ever published a syllable in England in my life. What I write is pure nature, and my pen and my soul have ever gone together. My writings I have always given away, reserving only the ex∣pence of printing and paper, and sometimes not even that. I never courted either fame or interest, and my manner of life, to those who know it, will justify what I say. My study is to be useful, and if your Lordship love mankind as well I do, you would, seeing you cannot conquer us, cast about and lend your hand towards accomplishing a peace. Our Independence, with GOD's blessing, we will maintain against all the world; but as we wish to avoid evil ourselves, we wish not to inflict it on others. I am never over-inquisitive into the secrets of the Cabinet, but I have some notion, that if you neglect the present opportunity, that it will not be in our power to make a seperate peace with you afterwards; for whatever treaties or alliances we form, we shall most faithfully abide by; wherefore you may be deceived if you think you can make it with us at any time. A lasting inde∣pendent peace is my wish, end and aim; and to accomplish that <HI>"I pray God the"</HI> Americans <Q>may never be defeated, and I trust while they have good officers, and are well commanded,</Q> and willing to be commanded, "<HI>that they</HI> NEVER WILL."</P>
