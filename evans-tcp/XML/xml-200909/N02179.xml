<HEAD><HI>Sober REMARKS</HI> On a BOOK, Entituled, <HI>A Modest Proof of the Order &amp; Government settled by Christ &amp; His Apostles in the Church;</HI> In a Letter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG> HAVE receiv'd and read the Book you lately sent me, entituled, <HI>A Modest Proof,</HI> &amp;c; in which the Au∣thor's profess'd Design is, <HI>to represent to the World what was the Primitive Model or Form of Church-Government; what was settled by our Saviour and his Apostles, in this point, and that from what is re∣corded of the Matter in the Books of the New-Testament.</HI> Pag. 1.</P>
<P>I observe the Book is said to be <HI>Re printed</HI> at <HI>Boston,</HI> &amp;c. I don't remember, that I ever saw any former Edition, nor had I opportunity to peruse this, till you were pleased to put your Book into my hands, desiring my Thoughts upon it. And in return to you, I must say, after an impartial unprejudic'd Perusal, I am far from thinking, that the Gentleman hath made a just Representation of the <HI>Form of Church-Government settled by our Saviour and his Apostles;</HI> or, that he hath been able in any measure to prove <HI>his own Model</HI>
<PB N="2" REF="002594_0005_0FDB7DE4B5581508"/>
from <HI>what is recorded in the Books of the New Testament.</HI> I can by no means joyn with the <HI>Publisher,</HI> who in his Preface is pleas'd to call the Author's Arguments <HI>convincing;</HI> and yet I am sensible the Book is, for the most part, plausibly written, and seems likely enough to draw unwary Persons into the same unhappy Mistakes, that the Author himself labours of. I should therefore have thought it a piece of good Service, if upon the Book's first coming forth, any Body had presently follow'd it with a suitable Answer. And I suppose, an Answer would have been given to it, with convenient speed, if it had not happen'd in <HI>this,</HI> as it often does in other cases of the <HI>like</HI> nature, that even those who wish the Work done, are loath to be themselves the doers of it, and wait and hope that some other Person of better Capacity, or more Leisure, will undertake it.—But now since the Book hath been suf∣fered (whether for this or for any other Reasons) to pass for several Months without any Answer, perhaps some may be dispos'd to question whether it be expedient to take no∣tice of it, at this distance of Time, and at such a Juncture.</P>
<P>However, Since (I observe) the Book is <HI>recommended as proper to be put into the hands of the Laity;</HI> since (you tell me) Numbers of Copies have been industriously dispers'd through the Town and Country; and this Author (I hear) is glory'd in as unanswerable; and some unwary Readers (as I said) it's probable enough, may be captivated with the specious shew of <HI>Scripture</HI>-Argument he brings: Upon these Conside∣rations, I cannot but incline to agree with you in thinking it convenient, and not yet out of season, to defend our selves, and <HI>put into the hands of the Laity</HI> some just and proper Re∣marks on the Treatise lately recommended to them. For, it's better to run the hazard of a few severe Censures, than by a criminal silence to betray so important an Interest as we are engag'd in, and tamely suffer any of our too un∣thinking Children or Neighbours to be seduced from what we look upon to be <HI>the Order of the Gospel.</HI> Therefore, altho' I might very well excuse my self from the Task you urge me to, by pleading the better ability of others to undertake it, and the pressure of my own Affairs, which require my utmost Diligence and Application; yet being sensible that others will be ready to make the same Excuses, I am not willing that the consideration of any private Inconveniencies shou'd discourage me from attempting to do a publick Service.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="002594_0006_0FDB7DE861049360"/>In compliance then with your repeated Desires, I shall endeavour now (in the fear of GOD and by His Help) to point out, and confute the most considerable Errors in the Book you sent me: I say the most considerable, because I don't intend to wast my own Time, or exercise your Patience with Remarks upon every thing of smaller Consquence, that is liable to exception in our Author; but shall only take notice of such Passages as seem most likely to lead his Rea∣ders into wrong Notions, in matters of importance: of which sort I shall mention four or five, before I come to that, which is the great Design of the Book.</P>
<P>THE <HI>First</HI> is in <HI>Page</HI> 2d. Where he says, <HI>That the Church, however</HI> otherwise <HI>disquieted, — yet heard little or no noise made for above</HI> 1400 <HI>Years about this point of Church-Government,</HI> save that <HI>one</HI> AERIUS <HI>started a Debate, but had so few to second him, that it died with himself and left his Name on Record among</HI> HERETICKS.— Here it's worth while to enquire, <HI>WHO</HI> it was that rank'd him among <HI>Hereticks</HI> for his o∣pinion about Church Government? Why truly <HI>Epiphanius</HI> was the first; who is generally observ'd to have been too warm in his Temper, and rash in his Censures, tho' otherwise a worthy good Man.— And then was it <HI>only</HI> for this opinion, that he condemn'd <HI>Aerius?</HI> No indeed; but he charg'd him with <HI>Heresy</HI> in another Point (which may well render that Father's Judgment suspected.) It was his asserting the <HI>Unlawfulness</HI> of <HI>praying</HI> for the <HI>Dead. Aerius</HI> appear'd <HI>against</HI> this Superstition; and <HI>Epiphanius</HI> (a Defender of it) <HI>therefore</HI> call'd him a <HI>Heretick.</HI>— The Truth is (as one <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tong</HI>'s Defence, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Pag. 30, 31.</NOTE> observes) these two <HI>Heresies</HI> of <HI>Aerius</HI> concerning the <HI>Parity of Bishops and Pressbyters,</HI> and the <HI>Unlawfulness of praying for the Dead,</HI> are much of the <HI>same Nature;</HI> and <HI>Epiphanius</HI>'s Confutation of them both, equally <HI>Learned</HI> and <HI>Satisfactory:</HI> for it is obser∣vable, that in the same place where he condemns that <HI>mon∣strous Heresy</HI> of the <HI>Identity of Order,</HI> He fairly confesses, <Q>That by the two Orders of <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> all Ecclesiastical Offices might be performed</Q>— What need then of the <HI>Prelate,</HI> so fiercely contended for? To this I shall only add the Words of Learned Bishop <HI>Stilling fleet,</HI> who says, If <HI>Aerius</HI> was a <HI>Heretick</HI> for holding the <HI>Identity of Order,</HI> it is strange that <HI>Epiphanius</HI> should be the first Man that should charge
<PB N="4" REF="002594_0007_0FDB7DEB73AFE348"/>
him with it; and that neither <HI>Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret,</HI> nor <HI>Evagrius,</HI> before whose time he liv'd, should <HI>censure</HI> him for it And why shou'd not <HI>Jerom</HI> have been equally animad∣verted upon, who is as express in this, as any Man in the World? — "As to the matter it self (says the Bishop) I believe upon the strictest Inquiry, <HI>Medina</HI>'s Judg∣ment will prove true, that <HI>Jerom, Austin, Ambrose, Sedulius, Primasius, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact,</HI> were all of <HI>Aerius</HI>'s Judgment, as to the <HI>Identity</HI> of both <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Order</HI> of <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> in the Primitive Church <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Iren.</HI> pag. 276, 277.</NOTE> — To these, it is certain, the Bishop might truly have prefixed the Names of <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Polycarp,</HI> two of the most ancient and venerable among the <HI>Fathers.</HI> But at this rate so many of the <HI>Fathers</HI> (and those too of the highest esteem and note) will be branded with <HI>Heresy,</HI> that we shall never know hereafter, when we may lay any Stress upon the Judg∣ment and Authority of <HI>Fathers.</HI> It was therefore honestly &amp; wisely done by our <HI>Author,</HI> not to meddle with <HI>them</HI> in the present <HI>Controversy,</HI> but to found his <HI>supposed Proof</HI> wholly upon the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> of whose <HI>Authority</HI> there can be no suspi∣cion. <HI>Scripture Evidence</HI> besure is sufficient; and will be con∣vincing to us for ever. And if our <HI>Author</HI>'s ill Success in this Attempt, don't prove too great a <HI>Discouragement,</HI> I hope that others of his own Church will (for the time to come) imitate the good Example he hath set them, in keeping close to the <HI>Scriptures;</HI> and not make the <HI>Fathers</HI> their Refuge on all occasions and place their confidence in them; who can by no means be allowed to be a certain foundation to build upon, <HI>Since</HI> (as Dr. <HI>Sherlock,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preserv. against Popery.</NOTE> justly observes) <HI>they many times contradict themselves and one another;</HI> So that (he tells us) it has often made him smile, with a mixture of Pity and In∣dignation, to see what a great noise <HI>Roman</HI> Disputants make among <HI>Women</HI> and <HI>Children</HI> and the <HI>meanest</HI> sort of People, with <HI>Quotations</HI> out of <HI>Fathers</HI> &amp; <HI>Councils;</HI> whom they pre∣tend to be all on their side".— But were the <HI>Authority</HI> of <HI>Fathers</HI> of ten times greater weight than it is, yet but very few, even among the <HI>Learned,</HI> (especially in this remote part of the Earth) ever had any opportunity fully to inform themselves, what <HI>their</HI> Judgment was. And I can never think it wise or safe to put a <HI>Controversy</HI> of any importance, on such a Foot, as that a few <HI>Learned Men</HI> may contradict
<PB N="5" REF="002594_0008_0FDB7DECF900ED10"/>
one another at pleasure, and all the World beside want either <HI>Learning, Books</HI> or <HI>Leisure,</HI> to examine thereby who speaks the <HI>Truth,</HI> and who denies it</P>
<P>I shall only add, with respect to the foregoing Passage, that as all the <HI>Fathers</HI> abovementioned were plainly of opi∣nion, that <HI>Bishops</HI> &amp; <HI>Presbyters</HI> were not two distinct <HI>Orders,</HI> nor invested with any different <HI>Powers,</HI> by Divine Institution; and as many other <HI>Fathers</HI> might have the same Senti∣ments, who have not lest their Opinions upon Record about it; and as scarce any Body of great Antiquity (except such whose <HI>Writings</HI> are known to have been shamefully cor∣rupted) so much as <HI>seems</HI> to be otherwise minded; so it is very certain, that almost the whole <HI>Christian Church,</HI> both <HI>Pro∣testant</HI> &amp; <HI>Popish,</HI> were of the same opinion, about the time of the <HI>Reformation.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT the Mind of the <HI>Romanists</HI> then was, may be learn'd from Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI>'s <HI>History of the Reformation,</HI> which tells us <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vol.</HI> 1. pag. 366.</NOTE>, <HI>That it was the common Style of the Age,</HI> to reckon Priests <HI>and Bishops as the same Office:</HI> —and from Dr. <HI>Willet</HI>'s <HI>Synopsis Papismi</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pag. 269, 272, 281. <HI>Edit. Anno</HI> 1630.</NOTE>, where he proves from the <HI>Papal Decrees,</HI> that the Romanists held <HI>all Ministers indifferently to be the Apostles Successors.</HI></P>
<P>Again, THAT the <HI>Protestants,</HI> whether of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> or of <HI>Foreign Churches,</HI> were all agreed in the same Opinion, is no less certain, whatsoever our <HI>Author</HI> may sug∣gest to the contrary.</P>
<P>AS for the <HI>Church of England,</HI> the Generality of it's Bishops and Divines, from the beginning of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> for a long while ('tis well known) expresly <HI>disclaimed</HI> the Necessity and Divine Right of Diocesan Episcopacy; and own'd the <HI>Foreign Churches,</HI> who were without it, to be <HI>true Churches</HI> of CHRIST.</P>
<P>IN the Days of King <HI>Henry</HI> the 8th, when Things were tending to a <HI>Reformation,</HI> The Book entituled, <HI>The Institution of the Christian Man</HI> (which was compiled by the Body of the Clergy, approved by both Houses of Parliament, and Pub∣lish'd by the King's Command) expresly says, <HI>In Novo Testa∣mento nulla mentio facta est aliorum Graduum aut Distinctimum in Ordinibus, sed Diaconorum vel Ministrorum, et Presbyterorum sive Episcoporum:</HI> That is, <Q>In the New-Testament, theres no mention of any other Degrees or Distinctions in <HI>Orders,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="002594_0009_0FDB7DEE7929A2F0"/>
but of <HI>Deacons</HI> or Ministers, and <HI>Presbyters</HI> or Bishops.</Q>— In the Reign of King <HI>Edward</HI> the 6th, Arch-Bishop <HI>Cranmer,</HI> in his Answer to the King's Questions (approved by the other Bishops) hath these Words, <HI>The Bishops and Priests were at one time, and were not two Things, but both one Office, in the be∣ginning of Christ's Religion</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Stillingf. Iren.</HI> pag 392.</NOTE>. — Upon the Revival of the <HI>Re∣formation,</HI> at Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI>'s coming to the Crown, the learned Bishop <HI>Jewel</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Apol.</HI> part 2. ch. 3 div. 5.</NOTE> delivers the like Acknowledgement; not as his own private opinion, but as the Sense of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> In St. <HI>Jerom</HI>'s time (saith he) there were <HI>Metropolitans, Arch-Bishops, Arch-Deacons,</HI> and others: but <HI>Christ</HI> appointed not these Distinctions of <HI>Orders</HI> from the Beginning. These Names are not found in all the <HI>Scriptures. This is the Thing we defend.</HI> St. <HI>Jerom</HI> saith <HI>Sciant Episcopi,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Let Bishops understand, that they are in Authority over Priests more by</HI> Custom, <HI>than</HI> BY ORDER OF GOD'S TRUTH: <HI>and that they ought to govern the Church in common.</HI> Again, <HI>Jerom</HI> saith, <HI>Idem est,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>A Priest is the same with a Bishop;</HI> they are both one thing; <HI>and the Churches were at first govern'd by the common Advice of the Priests.</HI>— The Bishop cites <HI>Erasmus,</HI> saying, <HI>Id Temporis idem erat Episcopus, Sacerdos, &amp; Presbyter: These three Names</HI> (Bishop, Priest &amp; Presbyter) <HI>were at that time</HI> (Jerom's) <HI>all one.</HI>—He also alledges that of <HI>Austin, Secundum honorum vocabula, quae jam Ecclesiae usus obtinuit, Episcopatus Presbyterio major est.</HI> <Q>The Office of a Bishop is above the office of a Priest <HI>(not by Authority of Scriptures, but)</HI> after the Names of Honour, which the Custom of the Church hath now ob∣tained</Q>—Thus Bp. <HI>Jewel.</HI></P>
<P>YEA Archbishop <HI>Whitgift</HI> himself, speaking of the Go∣vernment of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> by Bishops in his Time, says <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tract.</HI> 17. ch. 2. Vid. <HI>Lett. Adv.</HI> p. 13.</NOTE>, <Q>It is well known, that the manner and form of Government used in the <HI>Apostles</HI> time, and expressed in the <HI>Scripture,</HI> is <HI>not now</HI> observed; but hath — been altered: — <HI>neither do I know</HI> (saith he) <HI>any learned Man of a contrary Judgment.</HI></Q></P>
<P>AND indeed at the <HI>Reformation,</HI> Prelacy was establish'd in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> on a very different Foot from that of Scripture Institution. For not only in King <HI>Henry</HI> the VIII's Reign, but likewise in King <HI>Edward</HI> the VI's, the Bishops took out Commissions from the <HI>Crown,</HI> by which they
<PB N="7" REF="002594_0010_0FDB7DF361C0BF40"/>
were to hold their Bishopricks only during the <HI>King</HI>'s pleasure, and were impowered in the King's name, <HI>as his Delegates,</HI> to perform all the parts of the Episcopal Function: and Arch-Bishop <HI>Cranmer,</HI> (that excellent and pious Martyr) set an Example to the Rest in taking out one of them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Burnet</HI>'s <HI>Hist. Reform Abridg.</HI> Edit. 4 pag. 274.</NOTE>. So that in those Days, they made them no other than the <HI>King</HI>'s <HI>Ministers,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Heylen</HI> himself confesseth <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hist. Edw.</HI> VI.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I think these Things are sufficient to satisfy any Man, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> never pretended Diocesan Episcopacy to be of Divine Institution, before the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the First. And even in that Reign, matters were not car∣ried so high, as to deny the Validity of Ordination by Pres∣byters. <Q>For when some that had been ordain'd by mere Presbyters, offer'd themselves (in King <HI>James</HI>'s time) to be consecrated Bishops in the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> Dr. <HI>Andrews</HI> (Bishop of <HI>Ely</HI>) moved this Question, <HI>Whether they should not first be Episcopally Ordain'd Presbyters, that they might be capable of being admitted into the Order of Bishops?</HI> But Archbishop <HI>Bancroft</HI> (a most rigid Assertor of Episcopacy) answered, <HI>There was no need of it, since Ordination by Presbyters was Valid.</HI> The Bishop of <HI>Ely</HI> yielded; and immediately without repeating their Ordination as Presbyters, they were consecrated Bishops <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Hickman</HI>'s <HI>Apol.</HI> pag. 38. cited by Mr. <HI>Pierce, Vind.</HI> part 1. pag. 167.</NOTE>.</Q> — Thus we have seen what was the Judgment of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> from the very beginning of the <HI>Reformation,</HI> down to the Reign of King <HI>James</HI> the First, and during that Reign also. — The Claim of Apostolical Institution, or of Divine Right, was what King <HI>James</HI> himself (whether out of Policy, which he call'd his <HI>King Craft,</HI> or out of his insight into the Scripture) wou'd not suffer them to pretend in his time; as our famous Mr. <HI>Davenport</HI> observes <NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot"><HI>Church's Charter.</HI> pag. 79.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I shall only add here; I cannot learn whether there has been even in <HI>England,</HI> to this very Day, properly any publick and express <HI>Assertion</HI> of the <HI>Divine</HI> Right of Prelacy, either by Parliament or Convocation. I think no such thing can be found either in the Thirty nine <HI>Articles,</HI> or in the <HI>Homilies,</HI> or in the <HI>Form of Ordination,</HI> or in the <HI>Common Prayer Book,</HI> &amp;c.— And 'tis memorable, that the lower House of Convocation took occasion (<HI>Decemb.</HI> 11. 1702) to send to
<PB N="8" REF="002594_0011_0FDB7DF48633DC30"/>
the upper House a <HI>Declaration</HI> for the Divine Right: but it gave <HI>Offence.</HI> They were accus'd of ascribing <HI>too much</HI> to Episcopacy: and many of their own Body Dissented, upon this ground, that, however true the Doctrine might be, yet they questioned the LEGALITY of <HI>asserting</HI> it, being apprehensive of the <HI>danger</HI> of making any <HI>Declaration</HI> of that Nature, in Convocation, without a <HI>Royal Licence.</HI>— Upon this the Asser∣tors beg'd the Bishops to take the Doctrine into their mature Consideration, and to support it, and discourage the contrary. But such was their Lordship; wise Caution, that they wou'd not comply with their Desire, and even <HI>refus'd to satisfy them, that they did not dissent from them in this point.</HI>—And I know not whether since that time there has been any publick and legal Establishment of the foresaid Doctrine.</P>
<P>AND now, as to the Judgment of the Protestants of <HI>Foreign Churches,</HI> Dr. <HI>John Reynolds</HI> (the Oracle of the University in his Day) shall be my Voucher, who tells us in his Answer to <HI>Sir Francis Knowles,</HI> <Q>That they who for this <HI>Five Hundred</HI> Years have been industrious in Reforming the Church, have tho't <HI>that all Pastors (whether call'd Bishops or Presbyters)</HI> have, according to the Word of GOD, like Power and Authority.

And yet our Author is pleased to say (Page 3d) That at the Reformation <HI>the greatest and most considerable part of the Re∣formed Church, retained the ancient Order &amp; Government:</HI> which indeed is very true, it rightly understood; but if he means (as, if he intends any thing to his purpose by it, he must mean) to perswade his Readers, that the greatest part of the Reformed Churches retained <HI>Bishops,</HI> as an Order of Men by <HI>Divine Institution</HI> distinct from and superior to Presbyters. This I think is a great Mistake, as hath been already (I suppose) sufficiently proved.— However it is a Mistake which I have observed (with some surprize) several of the Episcopal Wri∣ters boldly running into; the reason of which, I presume is.
<PB N="9" REF="002594_0012_0FDB7DF65C3C0ED0"/>
That in some of the Foreign Protestant Churches <HI>Titular Bi∣shops</HI> were, and still are retained. I hope therefore, if not to hinder this Misrepresentation from being obtruded on the World any more, yet to prevent its being a Snare to some, by proving from their <HI>own Authentick</HI> Writings, that those Fo∣reign Churches (tho' they keep up the Name; yet) look upon a Bishop as nothing more than <HI>Primus inter Pares,</HI> a sort of <HI>standing Moderator</HI> among his Brethren; and that they allow no Power to a Bishop (as of Divine Institution) which they deny to Presbyters.</P>
<P>THE Truth of this will be as clear as the Sun to any Body, that will be at the pains to consult <HI>the Harmony of their Confessions.</HI> It would be tedious to cite Passages from them all. I shall therefore only mention the Words of the Confessi∣on <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m. Conf. Sect. <HI>11.</HI> Ex Helv.</NOTE> set foremost, (with which all that retained a nominal Episcopacy do agree) which are full to my purpose, and run thus; —<HI>Data est omnibus in Ecclesia Ministris</HI> una &amp; aequalis <HI>Potestas sive Functio. Cerre ab Initio Episcopi &amp; Presbyteri Eccle∣siam communi opera gubernarunt: nullus alteri se prae<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ulit,</HI> &amp;c. <Q>The Power or Office given to the Ministers of the Church, is <HI>the same</HI> and <HI>equal in all.</HI> Certainly in the beginning the Bishops and Presbyters did with a common Consent and Labour govern the Church. One did not lift up himself a∣bove another, nor usurp a greater Power or Authority:— Notwithstanding for Order's sake, some one of the Mi∣nisters called the Assembly together, propounded the matters to be consulted upon in the Meeting, also ga∣thered the Sentences <HI>(or Judgments)</HI> of the Rest: and final∣ly took Care, as much as in him lay, that there might a∣rise no Disorder</Q>— So that it appears very plainly, that those Churches abroad, which retained the Name of Bishops after their Reformation, yet acknowledged no Superiority, or Distinction of Powers and Orders, among the Ministers of CHRIST.</P>
<P>I shall only subjoyn here a Testimony or two. Dr. <HI>Stil∣lingfleet</HI> in his <HI>Iremcum</HI> (Pag. 411.) having enumerated many Protestant Cities and Places, whose Church Government is in the hands of <HI>Superintendents,</HI> adds upon it, — <Q>All these acknowlege no such thing as a Divine Right of Episco∣pacy but stifly maintain <HI>Jerom</HI>'s opinion of the primitive Equality of Gospel-Ministers.</Q>— And in the Account of
<PB N="10" REF="002594_0013_0FDB15C06DE77700"/>
<HI>Denmark</HI> for the Year 1692 (said to be written by the Lord <HI>Molesworth</HI>) I find these Passages; There are (says he) Six <Q>Superintendents in <HI>Denmark,</HI> who take it very kindly to be call'd <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>my Lord.</HI>— There are (he adds) also Four in <HI>Norway.</HI> These (he observes) have no Tempo∣ralities; keep no Ecclesiastical Courts; have no Cathedrals, with Prebends, Canons, Deans, Subdeans, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But are only <HI>Primi inter Pares;</HI> having the Rank above the inferior Clergy, and the Inspection into their Doctrine &amp; Manners.</Q>
And the Bishops in <HI>Sweden</HI> are in the like Condition. Writers speak very diminutively of their Power. The Author of <HI>the Present State of Europe</HI> for the Year 1705. observes, They retain little more than the Name, and a bare primary sort of Superiority over the other Superintendents; the Establish∣ing of the <HI>Lutheran</HI> Religion having deprived them of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, which they exercised before the Reformation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vid. Anderson</HI>'s <HI>Def.</HI> page 189, 190.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN fine, Let me add a Hint relating to the Church of <HI>Scot∣land,</HI> which is too excellent a Branch of the Reformation to be omitted. Great Pains have been taken by some to make the first Reformation there look as if it had been <HI>Episcopal;</HI> be∣cause for a while there were <HI>Bishops;</HI> and because there were <HI>Superintendents</HI> appointed for the Direction of the <HI>Church-Affairs.</HI> But if we look into the <HI>History</HI> of those Times, we shall find that the Bishops were <HI>obtruded</HI> upon the Church, by the <HI>Court;</HI> and the Superintendents were only a <HI>temporary Expedient,</HI> for the necessity of the Day, appointed by such too as were most Anti-Episcopal in their Judgment. And (what is worth ob∣serving) the Superintendants and Bishops were both in sub∣jection to the <HI>Assembly</HI> of Ministers. — So that notwith∣standing <HI>them,</HI> it appears that at the Reformation the Church of <HI>Scotland</HI> was <HI>Anti-Prelatical.</HI> They that would see this matter argu'd, may consult the Learned Mr. <HI>Jameson</HI>'s <HI>Nazi∣anzeni Querela</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Part 1. Sect. 8.</NOTE>; with a late Book entituled <HI>Memoirs of the Church of Scotland</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pag. 46.—81.</NOTE>, where it is particularly debated, and set in the clearest Light.</P>
<P>I have now said enough (I suppose) to refute our Author's Mistake, when he insinuates. That the greatest Part of the <HI>Reformed Church</HI> retained <HI>Prelacy.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002594_0014_0FDB7DF7880888A8"/>THE next Passage I shall take notice of, is in the 5th <HI>Page,</HI> where our Author says, <HI>Perhaps at the bottom 'tis none of the least Prejudices against Episcopacy, that they of that Perswa∣sion have generally asserted the</HI> JUST RIGHTS <HI>and</HI> PRERO∣GATIVES <HI>of</HI> PRINCES.— <HI>and accordingly have maintained the Doctrines of</HI> NON-RESISTANCE <HI>and</HI> PASSIVE OBEDI∣ENCE <HI>&amp;c.</HI>—Now, This is a Conjecture, I believe, the Gen∣tleman had much better have let sleep in his own Bosom; for, as he had no occasion to expose it, so I think it will be far from doing him or his Cause any Service. In short, I know of no judicious Dissenters, that plead for the Doctrine of <HI>Resistence,</HI> any further than it must be asserted by all, who can <HI>heartily</HI> thank God for <HI>our glorious Deliverance from Popery, and arbitrary Power by the late King</HI> WILLIAM <HI>of blessed Memory; as well</HI> as for <HI>the present happy Settlement of the British Crown in the illustrious House of</HI> HANOVER: and thus far I am sure the <HI>Church of England</HI> hath, and <HI>still does</HI> generally concur with us in asserting it; unless OCCASIONAL PERJURY, is much more practised by some sort of Persons, than ever Occasional <HI>Conformity</HI> was by others. If therefore our Author strains his beloved Doctrines of <HI>Non-Resistance</HI> and <HI>Passive Obedience,</HI> so far as to strike at the <HI>Revolution</HI> and <HI>present Settlement,</HI> I suppose the <HI>Church of England</HI> will boast little of such a Defender, and her <HI>Rival-Government</HI> (as He is pleas'd to call it) will less envy her such a Champion. But if the Gentleman holds these Doctrines in such a <HI>limited</HI> Sense, as is consistent with his being a <HI>Loyal</HI> Subject to his present Majesty, King <HI>GEORGE;</HI> then the Dissenters and He are much better agreed in the Point of <HI>Civil Government,</HI> than He seems willing to have the World imagin; and there appears no just Foundation for the above-mention'd Censure. Tho' I must confess, I cannot but close with another <HI>Remark,</HI> that follows it, viz. <HI>It's certain, there is too much of a</HI> CARNAL <HI>and</HI> WORLDLY <HI>Spirit, that keeps this Debate</HI> (about Church-Government) <HI>so long alive: and there is little hope it will die, till Christians be more animated with the true Spirit and Temper of the Gospel.</HI>— But on which Side the <HI>Fault</HI> lies chiefly, GOD knows. I would humbly say, in this Case, as <HI>David</HI> to his Father <HI>Saul, Let the LORD be Judge; and judge between Me and Thee!</HI></P>
<P>I shall take Notice of one thing more (tho' it comes in here a little out of Place) before I proceed to that which is the <HI>great Point</HI> in Controversy; because I would not be in∣terrupted
<PB N="12" REF="002594_0015_0FDB7DFC6A1A6588"/>
in the consideration of that, by turning aside to examin any incidental Passages foreign to it. The Thing I refer to is what our <HI>Author</HI> tells us, Page 12. "<HI>That the</HI> DEA∣CONS, whose <HI>Ordination</HI> we have an Account of in the 6th Chapter of the <HI>Acts, were invested with some share of the Apostolic Office▪ particularly of Preaching &amp; Baptising, as well as managing the Publick Stock of the Church.</HI> Now I might here observe the <HI>Limitation</HI> of this Episcopal Deacon to <HI>Preaching &amp; Baptizing;</HI> and might ask the Reason, Why he mayn't likewise be allow'd to administer the <HI>Lord's Supper?</HI> For it shou'd seem, They whose business it is to dispense one Seal of the Covenant, must certainly have Authority to dispense the other too. If not; where's the Rule or Reason, for the Division of them? — But not to insist on this.— One wou'd a little wonder how <HI>our Author</HI> shou'd fall into this unaccountable Notion, since he himself tells us (in the foregoing Page) "<HI>That the</HI> OC∣CASION, DESIGN and MANNER <HI>of Instituting this New Order is</HI> FULLY <HI>set down</HI> in the same <HI>Chapter;</HI> and there is nothing there concerning either of <HI>these,</HI> that can give a Man the least Suspicion of such a Thing. What then he founds his opinion in this matter upon, seems to be what he mentions presently; That he soon after finds <HI>Philip preaching &amp; bapti∣sing at Samaria,</HI> and <HI>Stephen disputing</HI> and <HI>doing great Wonders and Miracles among the People.</HI> And because he finds one Deacon <HI>disputing,</HI> and another <HI>preaching &amp; baptising,</HI> He thence unadvisedly concludes, <HI>it cannot be doubted,</HI> but that <HI>they and all the Rest, of whom we have nothing upon Record,</HI> were invested (by virtue of their <HI>Ordination</HI> to the Office of Dea∣con) with Authority to preach &amp; baptise; notwithstanding that, from the <HI>full Account</HI> we have of the <HI>occasion, design</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of their <HI>Institution,</HI> nothing more evidently appears, than that the <HI>whole</HI> and <HI>only</HI> Business, they were ordained for, was to <HI>serve Tables</HI> — Now, if this Reasoning will serve the Turn, it would be the easiest thing in the World, by an <HI>Argu∣ment</HI> exactly parallel to destroy the foundation of <HI>our Author's</HI> Distinction between Bishops and Presbyters, and all he hath built upon it, together with it; and so dispatch all the Re∣mainder of his Book in two or three Sentences</P>
<P>FOR if we may trust him, page 46, he finds <HI>James the Just, who</HI> (some <HI>suppose) might be one of the</HI> 70, <HI>advanced to the</HI> APOS∣TOLIC <HI>Order.</HI> From whence (to imitate <HI>his</HI> way of arguing) it cannot be doubted but that this <HI>James,</HI> &amp; all the Rest of the 70, were by virtue of their Commission (Luk. 10) invested with
<PB N="13" REF="002594_0016_0FDB7DFE36A41538"/>
the Apostolic Power and Authority; notwithstanding that from that Chapter in which we have a <HI>full account</HI> of the <HI>oc∣casion, design,</HI> and <HI>manner</HI> of sending forth the 70. nothing more appears, but that the whole Business they were commission'd to, was only to <HI>preach the Gospel, heal the Sick,</HI> and <HI>cast out Devils.</HI> And so, by our Author's own method of reasoning, the 70 will be of the same Office &amp; Order with the Apostles; and the whole Design of his Treatise will be superseded. — But not to insist on the Destructiveness of this Argument of our Author's to his whole Book besides: the plain Truth of the Case is this; That, after the Ordination of <HI>Philip</HI> to the Office of a <HI>Deacon,</HI> it pleased GOD to <HI>advance</HI> him (and he might do so by others of his Brethren likewise, for ought we know) to an Office of greater Usefulness and Honour, and send him to <HI>preach the Word and Baptise;</HI> for which he had the <HI>Warrant</HI> of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> which enabled him to <HI>cast out Devils</HI> and <HI>heal Diseases,</HI> in testimony of his Mission from GOD (Act. 8.6, 7.) But surely this is no Warrant to <HI>Deacons in our days,</HI> (who are not under the immediate direction of the same Spirit) to presume to do the same things.</P>
<P>THE Office, which <HI>Philip</HI> was promoted to, was that of an <HI>Evangelist</HI> We read (Act. 21.8.) <HI>of Philip the Evangelist, which was one of the seven,</HI> that is, one of the seven that were appointed to <HI>serve Tables,</HI> Act. 6. <HI>Philip,</HI> who was <HI>originally</HI> a Deacon in process of time, and it's like pretty soon became an <HI>Evangelist.</HI> Having for some time <HI>used the Office of a Deacon well, He purchased to himself a good Degree,</HI> and merited a higher Station in the Church. Our Author owns the <HI>Deacons</HI> to be inferior to Presbyters; to the <HI>seventy and others of their Order</HI> (as he speaks) who he says go by the name of <HI>Prophets</HI> in a Gos∣pel sense, <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Word: <HI>Pastors,</HI> &amp; <HI>Teachers,</HI> and <HI>Evan∣gelists</HI> — All these he makes to be but various Appellations of the <HI>same</HI> Order of Men, that is, <HI>Presbyters;</HI> as will appear to every one that reads his 13th and 14th Pages, however inconsistently he may afterwards express himself. He makes these <HI>Teachers &amp; Evangelists</HI> to be a <HI>distinct</HI> Office and Order from the <HI>Apostles</HI> and from the <HI>Deacons: inferior</HI> to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and <HI>superior</HI> to the <HI>Deacons,</HI> as in the Pages refer'd to. Now this Gentleman lays it down for an indisputable Maxim else∣where (pag 13, &amp; 56) That altho' all <HI>Apostles</HI> were <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> and <HI>Deacons;</HI> the superior Office or Order <HI>including</HI> the inferior; yet not <HI>vice versa.</HI> Every Teacher (he tells us)
<PB N="14" REF="002594_0017_0FDB7DFFB6D7EEA8"/>
was not an Apostle: We may add; Nor was every Deacon a Teacher, by the same Rule, the inferior Order or Office not including the superior. According to his own Principles then, at the time when <HI>Philip</HI> is styl'd an <HI>Evangelist,</HI> he must be a <HI>Presbyter</HI> (or of the Order of the seventy; and so <HI>superior</HI> to a Deacon. And it is more that probable, that <HI>Philip</HI> received his preferment <HI>before</HI> his going abroad, and dispensing the Word and Sacraments in <HI>Samaria.</HI> What tho' there's no mention made of any <HI>second Ordination</HI> he had for this End? Yet since he is expresly <HI>call'd</HI> an <HI>Evangelist,</HI> and did the <HI>Work</HI> of an Evangelist; our <HI>Author</HI>'s own Principles will oblige him to suppose, that the <HI>Deacon</HI> did not <HI>of his own Head,</HI> take upon him to execute the higher Office of an <HI>Evangelist</HI> or Prophet; but was impower'd by some <HI>new</HI> Commission from the <HI>Apostles,</HI> (who had before ordain'd him a Deacon) or else that he had an <HI>extraordinary</HI> and im∣mediate Call from GOD. And let him chuse which of these he will, it is equally destructive to the Pretences of his <HI>Epis∣copal Deacon,</HI> who (by virtue of an Ordination to this inferior Office only) presumes to <HI>Baptise</HI> &amp; <HI>Preach:</HI> Works, no ways belonging to his Office, and what truly a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Deacon (However despis'd by the Adversary, and however they should scoff at him for any such Pretences) might perform as <HI>war∣rantably</HI> as the <HI>Church of England</HI> Deacon. I have some where met with this Saying of a High-flying Worthy, That a <HI>preach∣ing Bishop</HI> is a <HI>prating Coxcomb.</HI> Methinks this might with much more propriety be apply'd to the preaching <HI>Deacon;</HI> a thing which the Scriptures know nothing of. I am sure there's no Countenance for it from the Case of <HI>Philip.</HI> Much less from the Case of <HI>Stephen,</HI> the Proto-Martyr; for, suppose <HI>him</HI> to have done all that <HI>Philip</HI> did, we must conclude then he had the like Preferment, and did not act in the Capacity of a <HI>Deacon</HI> (or an Officer inferior to a Presbyter) but of a <HI>Minister of the Word,</HI> as well as <HI>Philip.</HI>— Yet since <HI>Stephen</HI> did nothing but what (considering the extraordinary Gifts and Graces which many other Believers besides Ministers, had in those Days; I say, since he did nothing but what) a common Christian, in the like case, might have done, the Ar∣gument from him appears so much the weaker and more groundless.</P>
<P>I'm sure the <HI>History</HI> of the Primitive <HI>Institution</HI> of Deacons, in the 6th Chap. of <HI>Acts,</HI> makes very clearly <HI>against</HI> the <HI>preach∣ing</HI> Deacon. The Evidence there against him shines so bright
<PB N="15" REF="002594_0018_0FDB7E01380D1B18"/>
at the very first View, that it is a wonder how any who are not Slaves to an Hypothesis, can ever lisp a Word in his Favour. It is very obvious, The Apostles (who had hitherto sustained that Care chiefly) judged the <HI>serving of Tables</HI> an intolerable Burden to them, and what they cou'd not attend without neg∣lecting too much their better and more proper Work, the Ministry of the Word. <HI>It is not Reason</HI> (say they) <HI>that we should leave the Word of GOD, and serve Tables.</HI> And therefore they instituted an inferior Order of Men, to attend THIS BUSINESS (of serving Tables) that so the Preachers of the Gospel (being discharged from this heavy incumbrance) might <HI>give themselves continually to Prayer and to the Ministry of the Word;</HI> which being essential parts of the Ministerial Of∣fice, they durst not delegate these (however difficult) unto others to perform for them. From whence we may very reasonably conclude, when <HI>Philip</HI> was <HI>sent by the Spirit to preach &amp; baptise,</HI> that he was unloaded of his former cares and labours as a <HI>Deacon,</HI> in order to his more closely attending to his new Work: and <HI>some other</HI> Person, doubtless was ordained (if there were occasion for it) to <HI>serve Tables</HI> in his stead.</P>
<P>AND yet further to confirm my point, we may observe, that the Apostolical <HI>Directions</HI> concerning Deacons, exactly <HI>Harmonize</HI> with the Tenour of the Institution. In 1 Epist. to <HI>Tim.</HI> 3 Chap. the Apostle gives some Rules about Deacons, and states their necessary Qualifications (<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>ing with <HI>Acts</HI> 6.3.) none of which have any special or immediate Reference to the Work of <HI>Preaching:</HI> altho' in the same Chapter where the Apostle is describing the other Order of Men, the <HI>Bishops</HI> or Presbyters, he sets it down as one essential stroke in their Character, that they be <HI>apt to teach (able to teach others, and by sound Doctrine both to exhort and convince the Gainsavers,</HI> as he elsewhere explains himself) which we may well assure our selves, wou'd have been prescribed as a necessary qualification of a <HI>Deacon</HI> likewise, if it had been the Will of GOD, that <HI>Deacons</HI> should ordinarily be <HI>Preachers</HI> of the Word. But in stead of that, He only requires that those of this Order should be Men of Piety, Prudence, Gravity, Temperance, Generosity and the like.— I hope therefore none of our <HI>Deacons,</HI> that are Ordained (as I wish they all were when they have <HI>first been proved</HI>) will be drawn to doubt, whether they be of <HI>A∣postolical Institution,</HI> only because they are not called upon to Preach; since 'tis plain it never was the Will of GOD they
<PB N="16" REF="002594_0019_0FDB7E055EE20568"/>
should, but that they give themselves to the <HI>Ministry of Tables,</HI> the <HI>Lord's</HI> Table and the <HI>Poor</HI>'s; as the Church of <HI>England</HI> in her Ordination, having reference to this special Office, explains it; declaring there, <HI>That it appertains to the Deacon</HI>'s <HI>Office to assist the Presbyter in distribution of the Elements, gladly &amp; willingly to search for the Poor the Sick &amp; Impotent, that they may be relieved:</HI> Praying <HI>that they may be modest, humble, and constant in their Ministration</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Contin.</HI> of <HI>Pool</HI>'s Annotat. on Phil. 1.1.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>But thus much for the <HI>Deacons.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed now to consider with <HI>our Author,</HI> the <HI>Order and Government setled by CHRIST and his Apostles in the Church.</HI> In which the Gentleman's principal design is to prove, that there were two distinct Orders of Gospel-Ministers instituted by CHRIST himself; a <HI>Superior Order</HI> now commonly called <HI>Bishops,</HI> invested with <HI>Authority</HI> to <HI>govern</HI> the Church, and <HI>or∣dain</HI> proper Officers in it, as well as to preach the <HI>Word</HI> and administer the <HI>Sacraments:</HI> and an <HI>inferior Order,</HI> commonly called <HI>Presbyters,</HI> who are instituted only to preach the <HI>Word,</HI> and administer the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> and had no power of <HI>Ordination</HI> or <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> committed to them I say this is his principal design; for as to the <HI>Order of Deacons,</HI> which was instituted by the <HI>Apostles,</HI> he well observes, pag. 13 <HI>That there is no debate about them;</HI> save in the point that hath already been considered; <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the <HI>Deacons</HI> were by their Ordination invested with Authority to preach and baptise, which (I suppose) I have sufficiently proved they have not.</P>
<P>IN prosecution of what I have said to be our Author's great Design, he refers us to the <HI>Mission,</HI> first of the <HI>Twelve,</HI> Luke 9. and afterwards of the <HI>Seventy,</HI> Luke 10. Upon which he truly observes pag. 10. <HI>That they were both sent forth with the</HI> SAME <HI>Commission, and the</HI> SAME <HI>Power to preach the Gospel, to cast out Devils, to heal Diseases, and almost in all things with the same Instructions concerning their Conduct.</HI> And yet he tells us, pag. 11. <HI>That it is most certain they were two distinct Orders of Gospel Ministers.</HI></P>
<P>BUT upon what, the pretended Difference of Order between them can be founded, I must confess it is not easy to me to con∣ceive. Yet to confirm this Point by Testimony, he tells us, page 10. That <HI>Calvin</HI> scruples not to call the 70, <HI>in Dignity less than the Apostles, next in Office to them,</HI> &amp;c. But it must be observed
<PB N="17" REF="002594_0020_0FDB7E07F7609AF0"/>
here that in this he <HI>imposes</HI> on his Readers; for <HI>Calvin</HI> is there describing <HI>Evangelists;</HI> of whom he affirms roundly that they were inferior to the Apostles; but he mentions the 70 only <HI>transiently</HI> and speaks <HI>doubtfully</HI> of then subordination to the Twelve. Per <HI>Evangelistas,</HI> eos intelligo, qui quum dig∣nitate essent Apostolis minores, &amp;c. Quales fuerunt <HI>Lucas, Timotheur,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>ac</HI> FORTASSIS <HI>etiam septuaginta Discipuli, quos secundo ah Apostolis loco Christus designavit.</HI> He only says of the 70 Disciples, that they were appointed <HI>after</HI> the Apo∣stles, (referring to the <HI>time</HI> of their <HI>Mission,</HI> not the <HI>degree</HI> of their <HI>Dignity;</HI> as seems evident from the scope of the place) and that <HI>perhaps</HI> they were <HI>inferiour</HI> to them.</P>
<P>AND whereas our <HI>Author</HI> mentions two Instances of a difference in the Mission of the 12 from that of the 70, <HI>viz.</HI> Their more solemn <HI>Inauguration</HI> to their Office, and their being particularly called <HI>Apostles,</HI> &amp;c. I would observe, as to the first Article, that it does not appear to me, but that the <HI>Inauguration</HI> of both was <HI>equally solemn.</HI> What tho' we do not read of our Saviour's <HI>praying</HI> in so solemn a manner be∣fore his sending out the 70, as before the Mission of the 12, yet that argues little; for there were many things that <HI>Jesus</HI> did (as the Evangelist <HI>John</HI> remarks) which are <HI>not written.</HI> And then having sent our the 70, as our <HI>Author</HI> owns, upon the <HI>same Errand,</HI> and with the <HI>like Powers,</HI> 'tis <HI>highly probable</HI> the <HI>manner</HI> of their Mission was <HI>equally solemn.</HI> But then sup∣pose there was <HI>no</HI> such solemn Prayer before the Mission of the 70, as we read preceded the Mission of the 12, that makes no difference; since we cannot be <HI>sure</HI> that our Savi∣our's <HI>Prayer</HI> on the night before did <HI>immediately</HI> and <HI>peculiarly</HI> refer to <HI>their</HI> Mission; because, I suppose we sometimes read of our Saviour's making like <HI>solemn Prayer,</HI> when <HI>no</HI> remarka∣ble Events followed, nor <HI>any</HI> known extraordinary occasion was the Ground thereof.</P>
<P>AND now as to his other Instance, that the 12 were par∣ticularly honored with the Title of APOSTLES, in Distinc∣tion from the 70, this may possibly be a mistake; for when we are told, <HI>Luk.</HI> 10.1. <HI>After these things the Lord appointed</HI> OTHER 70 ALSO <HI>and sent</HI> them out, (with the same In∣structions and Powers) it may be very well read, <HI>other</HI> 70 <HI>Apostles,</HI> altho' it is not so expressed. And indeed our <HI>Author</HI> is pleased (in <HI>pag.</HI> 19.) to say of the 70, that they were CHRIST's <HI>Messengers and Ambassadors, so far as their Commission
<PB N="18" REF="002594_0021_0FDB7E0977CE50E0"/>
extended.</HI> Now he over and over confesses their Commission was the <HI>same</HI> with that of the 12; and therefore (according to his own Rule) the honorary Title of <HI>Apostles</HI> belong'd <HI>equally</HI> to them. And here it's worth while to observe, That how∣ever diminutive he may make the name of <HI>Disciples</HI> to be, 'tis no other than what the <HI>Eleven</HI> were distinguished by, when they received their Commission. <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.16. They are called, <HI>The Eleven Disciples.</HI></P>
<P>HE offers <HI>two Arguments</HI> further to show that the 12 &amp; the 70 were two distinct orders of Gospel-Ministers. <HI>First,</HI> That <HI>they are never numbered together, but in two distinct Classes</HI>—.How often (pray) are they numbered so? We don't find the 70, spoken of above twice, that is, at their <HI>Mission,</HI> and upon their <HI>Return:</HI> and this <HI>separately</HI> or by <HI>themselves;</HI> the 12 not being mentioned in the Story. We don't any where (that I re¦member) find the 12 and the 70. mentioned in the same-place, and numbered in two distinct Classes. And as for the <HI>Apostles being still called</HI> 12 <HI>and not</HI> 82; that is easily accounted for: inasmuch as the Mission of the 70 was a <HI>temporary</HI> and <HI>occasional</HI> thing; and we never read of any <HI>second</HI> Mission, or further imployment of them, as <HI>Apostles</HI> or <HI>Preachers,</HI> after their <HI>Return</HI> from the Mission we have an Account of. Whereas the other 12 were <HI>still</HI> employed on every occasion, and <HI>gene∣rally</HI> were with their Master, as his <HI>special Attendants.</HI></P>
<P>AND now for his <HI>second</HI> Argument, (which he boasts will put the matter out of all dispute) <HI>What a solemn Work</HI> (says he) <HI>was there, at the translation of one from the number of Disciples, that he might be reckoned with the Eleven, and succeed to</HI> Judas <HI>his Apostleship?</HI> And again, <HI>pa.</HI> 41. he bids us remember, <HI>that the</HI> WHOLE SEVENTY <HI>could not fill up the Chair of</HI> ONE APOSTLE, &amp;c. But there is no weight in this, if we consider what were the <HI>necessary qualifications</HI> of an <HI>Apostle,</HI> viz. an Im∣mediate Call, extraordinary Gifts, having been an Eye witness to the Life, Sufferings and Resurrection of CHRIST, &amp;c. and that CHRIST at his Ascension left <HI>none other</HI> Ministers in Commission but the <HI>Eleven.</HI> For as to the 70, they were not in Being then, as <HI>Ministers of the Word;</HI> their Commission having <HI>expired</HI> long before, and <HI>not</HI> being <HI>renewed</HI> as was that of the <HI>Eleven.</HI> And then, I suppose, it is uncertain, whether <HI>Matthias</HI> was of that number, were they still in Commission. So that, putting these things together, it appears, that <HI>Matthias's</HI> succession to <HI>Judas</HI> in the Apostleship (however solemn Work
<PB N="19" REF="002594_0022_0FDB7E0D283B1E38"/>
there was about it) affords no manner of Argument for a <HI>Difference of Order</HI> between the 70 and the 12.</P>
<P>AND truely whatever <HI>Distinction</HI> between them may be pretended, sure I am, it could not be <HI>that</HI> which our Author would fain prove between <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters.</HI> For neither the 70, nor yet the 12, had any power given them at their first <HI>Mission</HI> to <HI>ordain Officers,</HI> or to govern the Church; nor indeed could they: for at this time there was no <HI>Gospel Church</HI> to be <HI>governed,</HI> or to have <HI>Officers settled</HI> in it.</P>
<P>TO this purpose Mr. <HI>Sage</HI> (a considerable Writer, of the Church of <HI>England</HI>) saith, <Q>It is most obviously observable, in the Evangelical Records, that the Christian Church was not (could not be) founded, till our Lord was risen, seeing it was to be founded upon his Resurrection. (He goes on) Our Martyr <HI>Cyprian</HI> (as appears from his Reasonings on diverse occasions) seems very well to have known, and very distinctly to have observed, that <HI>the Apostles themselves got not their Commission to be Governours of the Christian Church, till</HI> after <HI>the Resurrection.</HI> And no wonder, for this their Com∣mission is most observably recorded.</Q> <HI>Joh.</HI> 20.21, &amp;c. <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vindic. of the Princ. of the <HI>Cypr.</HI> age. Ch. 6. Sect. 5. Vid. <HI>Anders</HI> Def pag. 78.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>NOR doth it appear that the Commission of the 70 (<HI>Luk.</HI> 10) was any thing more than <HI>temporary;</HI> for tho' our Author is pleased to speak of <HI>them</HI> once and again, in such a manner as seems to intimate, that they are often mentioned in the New Testament: yet I don't remember, nor can I find that we ever read any thing of them, after their <HI>Return</HI> from this Mission; as I hinted before.</P>
<P>AND indeed, I cannot tell whether the <HI>Twelve</HI> would, by virtue of their Commission <HI>at this time,</HI> have had any Autho∣rity either to <HI>baptise</HI> or <HI>preach,</HI> after our Lord's Ascension, if their <HI>Commission</HI> for these things had not been renewed. For CHRIST himself thought it needful, to give them a <HI>new Charge</HI> to <HI>teach</HI> &amp; <HI>baptise,</HI> at the same time that he committed to them the <HI>Powers</HI> of <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>Ordination,</HI> just before his Ascension. To this purpose Mr. <HI>Sage</HI> adds to what he says above, <Q>No such thing is any where recorded of the <HI>Seventy</HI> (as the Renewal of their Commission;) nothing more certain than that their Commission which is recorded, <HI>Luk.</HI> 10. did constitute them only temporary Missionarys and that for an Errand which could not possibly be more
<PB N="20" REF="002594_0023_0FDB7E0FB1AA6AA0"/>
than temporary. That Commission contains in its own bosom, clear evidences, that it did not install them in any standing Office in the Christian Church, <HI>which was not yet in being,</HI> when they got it. Could than Commission which is <HI>Luk.</HI> 10. any more constitute the 70 standing Officers of the Christian Church, than the like Commission recorded <HI>Math.</HI> 10. cou'd constitute the <HI>Twelve</HI> such standing Offi∣cers? But it is manifest that this Commission did not constitute the <HI>Twelve</HI> Governours of the Christian, Church; otherwise what need of a <HI>new Commission</HI> to that purpose after the Resurrection? Presumable therefore it is that S. <HI>Cyprian</HI> did not <HI>at all</HI> believe that the 70 had any Successors, Office-bearers in the Christian Church, seeing it is so observable, that <HI>they themselves</HI> received no Com∣mission to be such Office-bearers.</Q> Thus Mr. <HI>Sage.</HI></P>
<P>AT least thus much is certain, that without <HI>further Powers</HI> given them after our Saviour's Resurrection, the Apostles themselves must never have gone to <HI>the Gentiles.</HI> For in our Lord's Commission to them <HI>Matth.</HI> 10, they are expresly charged <HI>not to go into the way of the Gentiles, but only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</HI> From whence it will follow either that the 70 had a <HI>larger</HI> and <HI>more honorable</HI> Commission than the <HI>Apostles</HI> had <HI>at first</HI> and so were superior to them; or that the Commission of the 70 was but <HI>temporary;</HI> or if it were perpetual, yet that it never was extended by CHRIST <HI>beyond the Circumcision</HI> I think no <HI>fourth</HI> supposition can be made; so that <HI>one</HI> or <HI>other</HI> of those <HI>three</HI> must be allowed. And which ever our Author thinks fit to grant, it will be the confusion of his Scheme Besure he won't be willing to grant the <HI>first,</HI> that the <HI>seventy</HI> had a larger and more honorable Commission, and were superior to the <HI>Apostles.</HI> And I think no body ever yet supposed it. Nor will the <HI>second</HI> please him better; for if the Commission of the <HI>seventy</HI> was but <HI>temporary,</HI> and expired upon their return to their Master, then it will follow, that CHRIST left not <HI>two</HI> but <HI>only one Order of Officers</HI> in his Church, at his Ascension If therefore he should chose the <HI>third</HI> sup∣posal (which at first view seems most favorable to his cause) that the <HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>seventy</HI> did not <HI>expire,</HI> but that it was <HI>confined</HI> to the <HI>Circumcision,</HI> yet neither will this serve his Turn. For if the <HI>Commission</HI> of the 70 was not extended by CHRIST to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> then we have no concern at all with it, nor did CHRIST leave any other <HI>Officers in Commission</HI> at his Ascension, that had any thing to do with the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> besides
<PB N="21" REF="002594_0024_0FDB7E1106D54480"/>
his <HI>Eleven Apostles;</HI> but to <HI>them</HI> he committed the whole Care of <HI>discipling all Nations, preaching</HI> the <HI>Word, administring</HI> the <HI>Sacraments, governing</HI> the <HI>Church,</HI> and <HI>ordaining</HI> others to <HI>assist</HI> and <HI>succeed</HI> them in this important Charge; and <HI>promised</HI> for their encouragement, to be with <HI>them,</HI> and their <HI>Successors</HI> in it always, even to the end of the World. Now if CHRIST, at his Ascension, left <HI>no other Officers in Commission</HI> besides his <HI>Eleven Apostles,</HI> or <HI>no others in Commission that extended unto the Gentiles,</HI> then all that our Author <HI>advances,</HI> under his <HI>first head,</HI> concerning the <HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>seventy</HI> comes to nothing. For whether that <HI>Commission</HI> was <HI>temporary,</HI> on whether it was <HI>re∣strained</HI> to the <HI>lost sheep of the house of Israel,</HI> we are alike uncon∣cerned with it. And so likewise all the pains he takes under his <HI>second head,</HI> to show how the Office of the <HI>Apostles</HI> and the Office of the <HI>seventy,</HI> were distinguished from each other, will be found to be labour spent to no purpose. For since we never read that CHRIST extended the <HI>Commission</HI> of the <HI>seventy</HI> to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> it will thence follow, either that he suffered their <HI>Commission</HI> to expire, or that he left it <HI>confined</HI> to the <HI>Jews:</HI> And take it which way you will, you can find still but <HI>one Order of Officers instituted by CHRIST himself,</HI> with whom the <HI>Gentile Churches</HI> have any thing to do.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>the most</HI> of what the Gentleman says besides under his <HI>second general head,</HI> I have no controversy at all with him. For I readily, acknowledge what he asserts <HI>pa.</HI> 17, That the <HI>Commission</HI> given by our Saviour to the <HI>Apostles</HI> after his <HI>Resur∣rection</HI> was <HI>unlimited and universal, not only in respect of</HI> power <HI>to discharge all acts of Religion, relating either to</HI> ministry <HI>or</HI> go∣vernment; <HI>but also in respect of</HI> place, <HI>not being confined to any particular</HI> Province, <HI>but sent to the whole</HI> World.</P>
<P>AND (tho' some of the Instances he gives, won't bear scanning, yet) I firmly believe as he sayes, <HI>pa.</HI> 22, 23. <HI>That it appears the Apostles had</HI> (some sort of) <HI>Authority over other Pastors and Teachers in the Church, from several Instances of their exercising of it, in several respects and ways, recorded in the sacred History.</HI> And I will venture to say further, that during the <HI>Infant-State</HI> of the Christian Church, before the Canon of the <HI>New-Testament</HI> was compleated, (without which the uninspired <HI>man of GOD</HI> could not be <HI>thoroughly furnished unto every good work</HI>) it was absolutely necessary, that some kind of <HI>Jurisdiction,</HI> over the <HI>uninspired Pastors</HI> of the Churches, should be committed to such men as the <HI>Apostles,</HI> who being under the immediate Conduct of an <HI>infallible Spirit,</HI> might be able as often as occa∣sion
<PB N="22" REF="002594_0025_0FDB7E129CF9E090"/>
required, with all <HI>Authority</HI> to <HI>charge</HI> &amp; <HI>direct</HI> the other <HI>Pastors how to behave themselves in the house of GOD.</HI> A notable Instance we have of this, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.14, 15. where notwithstand∣ing the singular advantages <HI>Timothy</HI> had had to inform himself about the <HI>Work of an Evangelist,</HI> by his intimate acquaintance with the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> and frequent attendance upon him; yet the <HI>Apostle</HI> is afraid, that if he should be hindered from coming to him as soon as he desired, <HI>Timothy</HI> might be at a loss how to discharge the Trust reposed in him; and therefore he writes unto him the solemn Charges, Exhortations and In∣structions of that Epistle, that <HI>he might know how he ought to behave himself in the Church of the living GOD.</HI> And not satis∣fyed with this, he followed it with a <HI>second Epistle</HI> on the same Design afterwards.</P>
<P>NOW, if it be evident that the Apostles had some sort of Jurisdiction over other Pastors; and if it be also evident that there was an absolute necessity, <HI>at that day,</HI> that some such men as they should have such Jurisdiction; it may very na∣turally be inquired, <HI>Whether there is the same necessity since, that some of the Ministers of the Gospel should have a like Authority over others throughout all Ages?</HI> And, <HI>Whether the Scriptures teach us that this is the Will of GOD?</HI></P>
<P>AS to the <HI>first</HI> of these <HI>Inquiries;</HI> it is very obvious on two Accounts, <HI>That the same Reason does not hold in the nature of the thing it self, for a superior power in some Ministers over others now.</HI> For <HI>first,</HI> there are no Officers in the Church in these later Ages, under the Conduct of an <HI>Infallible Spirit,</HI> to issue out di∣rections and commands to others on emergent occasions. Nor indeed is there any body on this side <HI>Rome</HI> that pretends to it. Now it's thought by some of great name and judgment, That the higher Degree of Authority &amp; Sway, which the Apostles had above others, was owing very much to their extraordi∣nary Gifts of Infallibility, of discerning Spirits, and the like, which were peculiar to them. And indeed there's the greatest difficulty (as Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> observes) to discern how much of their power over Presbyters or Bishops was <HI>merely</HI> from the Excellency of their Gifts and Privileges, and how much might be (if any was) from their Supremacy of Office and Imperial Authority. Nor, <HI>secondly,</HI> is there the same <HI>Need</HI> that there should be any such <HI>infallible Rulers</HI> in the Church now, that there was in the <HI>Apostles</HI> dayes; because the <HI>Canon of Scripture</HI> being now completed, every Minister of the Gospel hath
<PB N="23" REF="002594_0026_0FDB7E140BF2BF10"/>
an infallible and perfect Rule to direct him in his Administra∣tions. To this purpose our <HI>Author (pag.</HI> 33, 34) acknowlegeth, as that <HI>the Gospel-Doctrine being once sufficiently attested &amp; con∣firmed by miraculous operations, there was no further need of continuing them; So, that some Things peculiar to the Apostles, such as, their being</HI> infallible Guides in delivering the Doctrine of the Gospel, their unlimited Commission, <HI>&amp;c. had a particular Respect to the</HI> first planting <HI>of the Gospel, and the erecting and constituting of the Christian Church in the World: which when performed, these extraor∣dinary Powers ceased.</HI>—Since therefore the same Reasons don't hold good <HI>now</HI> for a superiority of some Ministers over others, we have no ground to believe that such a superiority ought to continue still, <HI>unless the Scriptures teach us notwithstanding, that it is the Will of GOD that this superiority should be standing and perpetual in the Church.</HI> And this is what our <HI>Author</HI> en∣deavours to prove under his third Head.</P>
<P>BUT before the Examination of his Argument here, I must premise, that he and I are agreed, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> were in∣vested with <HI>some Powers that were extraordinary &amp; temporary, and expired with their Persons;</HI> and that therefore in <HI>these</HI> they could have no Successors.</P>
<P>Again, WE are agreed, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> were invested with other <HI>powers that were ordinary &amp; designed to be perpetual,</HI> in which they were to have <HI>Successors,</HI> who should possess them through∣out all Ages. And with an eye to their <HI>Successors</HI> it was that their Lord <HI>promised</HI> to <HI>be with them always to the end of the World.</HI></P>
<P>NOW since we are both agreed in these two things, (and have (I think) the concurrence of all the World both <HI>Con∣formists</HI> &amp; <HI>Non-conformists</HI> with us in them,) the only thing that remains to be disputed is, Whether <HI>that Jurisdiction</HI> which was exercised by the <HI>Apostles</HI> over <HI>other Pastors,</HI> was <HI>one of their</HI> ORDINARY POWERS, <HI>in which they were to have</HI> SUC∣CESSORS? Or, <HI>Whether it was a power only</HI> EXTRORDI∣NARY <HI>and</HI> TEMPORARY, <HI>in which they were to have no Successors, and to expire with their Persons?</HI></P>
<P>NOW here the force of truth hath constrained our <HI>Author</HI> to make an acknowledgement, which is in effect at once to give up his whole cause. For he himself in his 33d <HI>page,</HI> reckons <HI>the Jurisdiction the Apostles had over all Churches</HI> (and by consequence over the Pastors of them also) among <HI>those Powers that were extraordinary &amp; temporary, and expired with their Persons:</HI> By doing which, he hath (I say) in effect at once
<PB N="24" REF="002594_0027_0FDB7E1577F2D870"/>
given up his whole cause; for hereby he hath cut himself off from all possibility of proving, by the Instances he gives, <HI>any ordinary power of Jurisdiction in the Apostles over other Pastors.</HI> For supposing he had given ten thousand Instances, in which the <HI>Apostles</HI> exercised an <HI>Authority</HI> over other <HI>Pastors▪</HI> yet all these might be, for ought he or any man else can tell, not by virtue of any <HI>ordinary power,</HI> they were intrusted with, in which they were to have successors; but only by virtue of <HI>that extraordinary Power in which they were to have no Successors,</HI> by which he acknowleges it was, that <HI>they had a Jurisdiction over all other Churches.</HI> So that here I might very fairly with∣draw my hand from the Table; for the Gentleman hath him∣self put it out of his own power to prove any thing by the Argument he makes use of. And yet I suppose it was not <HI>want of thought</HI> but <HI>force of truth,</HI> and <HI>unavoidable necessity,</HI> that drew him into this Acknowlegement so fatal to his own Ar∣gument. For any man that will be at the pains to examin the Instances he hath given of the <HI>Apostles Authority</HI> over other Pastors, and will then carefully look over the Epistles to the <HI>Corinthians, Philippians, Timothy</HI> and <HI>Titus</HI> (to mention no more) will presently find many Instances just like the most of those given by our Author, (nay some of <HI>his</HI> may be taken into the number also) in which the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> exercised an <HI>Authority</HI> over <HI>Timothy, Titus, Epaphroditus,</HI> and others, whom <HI>Episcopal Divines</HI> account <HI>Bishops.</HI> Now this observation being so very easy, forced our Author upon this unhappy <HI>Dilemma,</HI> either to affirm that the Apostle exercised an <HI>Authority</HI> over such as <HI>Episcopal Divines</HI> account <HI>Bishops,</HI> by virtue of his <HI>ordinary Power</HI> [for no man is able to give me any tolerable Reason, why his Government over <HI>Bishops</HI> should be grounded on an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Power, and yet his Government over <HI>Pastors</HI> be by virtue of his ordinary Power] <HI>that was to be perpetuated in the Church;</HI> which would be to set up <HI>an ordinary Officer in the Church by divine Institution superior to Bishops;</HI> a thing contrary to the declared sense of our Author and his Brethren: or else, to avoid the ill consequence of this, he must say, that this <HI>Au∣thority of the Apostles over all Churches &amp; Pastors was one of their Extraordinary Powers;</HI> which sort of powers he elsewhere ac∣knowledges <HI>expired with their persons</HI> and <HI>that they had no succes∣sors in them.</HI> And this latter inconvenience he hath thought fit to choose, though it be no less destructive to his own Ar∣gument, than the former, as I have shown above.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="002594_0028_0FDB7E1946647980"/>I have now said enough (I suppose) to satisfy every in∣telligent unprejudiced Person of the weakness and Inconsist∣ency of our <HI>Author</HI>'s Proofs of his own Scheme. However I am content to follow him still longer, with Remarks upon some further Passages, in which he more and more weakens and perplexes the Cause he pleads for.</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 35. he says, <HI>That no part of the Apostolick Office is more necessary to be of perpetual duration in the Church, than their authoritative In∣spection over the ordinary Pastors.</HI> That he hath as yet proved no necessity of this from the <HI>Scriptures,</HI> hath been I suppose con∣vincingly shown. And that there is no necessity of it <HI>in the nature of the thing it self</HI> (to omit what hath been said already) any man may satisfy himself, if he will but impartially inquire, whether the <HI>Ends of Government</HI> are not as well answered, the Interests of <HI>Religion</HI> as effectually promoted, and the <HI>Church</HI> as well guarded against Errors, Schisms and Corruptions, in those <HI>Countries,</HI> which acknowlege no <HI>Superiority</HI> in Pastors one over another, as in those <HI>two Kingdoms,</HI> that are the only <HI>Protestant</HI> ones, in which such a Superiority is held to be of Divine Institution?</P>
<P>OUR <HI>Author</HI> now attempts to produce some <HI>further</HI> Proofs of his Scheme from the holy-Scriptures. Several Texts he brings to prove that the <HI>Apostolic Office</HI> (he must here especi∣ally point at the power of <HI>universal Inspection</HI> over Churches and Pastors, or else he says nothing to the purpose) <HI>was not extraordinary and temporary,</HI> but design'd to be standing and perpetual.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>first</HI> Place, He draws an Argument from the <HI>Com∣mission</HI> in <HI>Matth.</HI> 28.19, 20. Where <HI>CHRIST enjoyns the Apostles to teach all Nations, whom they should disciple, to observe all things whatsoever he had commanded them,</HI> and <HI>gives them a Promise to be with them to the end of the World.</HI> This he calls their <HI>full</HI> &amp; <HI>last Commission:</HI> by this therefore they must stand or fall, and the Gentleman must despair of his Cause, if this will not sup∣port it.</P>
<P>NOW there's nothing contained in this, but what is the work of <HI>ordinary Ministers</HI> or <HI>Pastors.</HI> Teaching and baptizing, which are the undoubted work of Presbyters, are here <HI>ex∣presly</HI> mention'd: but indeed we must interpret this Text, in the utmost Latitude, so as to take in all ministerial Powers, of Ordination, Discipline, and Government, as being neces∣sarily imply'd. Here's the grand <HI>Charter</HI> for our Office, and all the Power that any can justly claim, must be here included.
<PB N="26" REF="002594_0029_0FDB7E1B745650C0"/>
And the <HI>whole</HI> of the Power here imply'd, belongs to all those, unto whom the Commission extends. Now it was given (our Author owns) not merely to the Apostles, but also to their <HI>Successors:</HI> and so the <HI>Promise</HI> annexed, is to their <HI>Office,</HI> not to their <HI>Persons</HI> only. And the <HI>Office</HI> they were authoriz'd to, by this Commission, was not to expire with them, but to <HI>continue</HI> unto the <HI>end of the world.</HI></P>
<P>WE must note, The <HI>Apostles</HI> may be considered under a <HI>double</HI> notion, as having either <HI>ordinary</HI> or <HI>extraordinary</HI> Powers. This Commission was given them, in one or other, or both, of these Capacities. So far as it cou'd relate to them in their <HI>extraordinary</HI> Capacity, it must be only <HI>Personal,</HI> and a Patent for Life, expiring with themselves; or at most continuing only through the Age of Inspiration and Miracles. But so far as it related to them in their <HI>ordinary</HI> Character, it was design'd to be <HI>perpetual,</HI> and the Promise belongs to their Successors in common with them.—That it relates to them under the <HI>latter</HI> Consideration more especially, is evident from the Tenor of the Commission, which prescribes only Work that is ordinary; and from the Tenor of the Promise, which looks to all future Ages, and therefore supposes their perpetual Duration. But in these things the Author and I are agreed.</P>
<P>ALL the <HI>Dispute</HI> here is, Who are the true <HI>Successor,</HI> of the Apostles; and so, who may lay Claim to this Divine Com∣mission and Promise? Now there are two things which may suffice to decide the Case: <HI>viz.</HI> The nature of the <HI>Work</HI> laid out in the Commission, and the <HI>Character</HI> of the Apostles in their <HI>ordinary</HI> Capacity. And by both of these Rules (I presume) it must be concluded that <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>ordinary Pastors</HI> are the Apostles <HI>true Successors.</HI> For the <HI>Work</HI> here assign'd is what (as I before observ'd) properly belongs to <HI>Them;</HI> who have ever therefore repair'd to this Commission, to vindicate them∣selves, in the ministerial Acts of <HI>preaching, baptising,</HI> &amp;c.—And then if we consider the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their <HI>ordinary Capacity,</HI> it will appear they were most properly <HI>Presbyters,</HI> or <HI>Ministers of the Word,</HI> and could be <HI>Bishops</HI> only in the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Sense Be sure they were not Bishops after the <HI>English Form,</HI> nor in∣tended so to be: for according to this, our Lord must have assign'd to each of the Apostles his <HI>distinct Province,</HI> his parti∣cular Post, or Charge, to act and rule in, with a mutual In∣dependency; seeing they are the approved Principles of that Model, <HI>That all Bishops are</HI> equal, <HI>and have no Eminency of Power one above another:</HI> So likewise <HI>that every Church must have its
<PB N="27" REF="002594_0030_0FDB7E1D01813D18"/>
particular Bishop, and that there can be in a Church but</HI> one <HI>Prelate at a time.</HI> Whereas if we reflect, we shall find, that a <HI>Plorality</HI> (even no less than 11 or 12) presided together over the Church in <HI>Jerusalem</HI> at the beginning; and that the Apostles tarry'd there a <HI>considerable Time,</HI> (as the sacred Story assures us, and if some ancient Church-Histories may be credited, it was no less than the space of several <HI>Years) taking Care of that Church</HI> (which called for peculiar Regards from them) in it's <HI>Infant</HI> State: at least it may be believed they ordinarily resided in and about <HI>Jerusalem</HI> for a while; perhaps only when there was uncommon occasion, issuing out upon particular Missions, and then returning to <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> as seems very probable from the Instance we have, <HI>Acts</HI> 8.14 — 25 And now in ma∣naging the <HI>Affairs</HI> of <HI>that Church,</HI> the <HI>Apostles</HI> acted, either with an equal or an unequal Authority. And take it which way you please, they could not be <HI>Bishops</HI> after the Diocesan notion. For if they all acted with an <HI>equal</HI> Authority; then they could not be <HI>Bishops,</HI> for this very <HI>pertinent</HI> Reason, because there can be but <HI>one</HI> Bishop in a Church Neither again cou'd they be Bishops, suppose 'em to have an <HI>unequal</HI> Autho∣rity, because <HI>all</HI> Bishops are <HI>equal,</HI> and none subordinate to others. Now they must be either Bishops or Presbyters. And since they were not the <HI>former,</HI> What must we conclude?</P>
<P>SO then it appears by the Character they must bear, while ru∣ling in the Church at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> that the Apostles were <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in their ordinary Capacity—In the Root &amp; Principle, they were only <HI>Presbyters:</HI> the other parts of their Character were only additional, or occasional and circumstantial. Our <HI>Author</HI> himself makes no Exception here, save as to their power of <HI>Superintendency,</HI> which he makes to be one of the <HI>essential</HI> and <HI>perpetual</HI> or ordinary Powers of an Apostle: but since he hath not as yet been able to prove this, we may safely adhere to our Opinion, That the <HI>Apostles,</HI> consider'd in their ordinary Capacity, were but <HI>Presbyters:</HI> and so consequently all that truly sustain the Character of <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Gospel-Ministers,</HI> are the Apostles <HI>true Successors;</HI> and hence, by an easy Inference, appear entitul'd to the Commission and the Promise given of old to the Eleven Disciples, by our blessed Lord.</P>
<P>Briefly; WE may set the matter in this Light: Either this Commission <HI>does</HI> belong to <HI>Presbyters,</HI> or it does <HI>not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="002594_0031_0FDB7E1EB74AC518"/>IF you assume in the <HI>Negative,</HI> or say, it does <HI>not:</HI> then it can't easily be made out, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> have <HI>any Divine Mission at all,</HI> or any Warrant to minister in holy things. I have be∣fore prov'd there is but <HI>one</HI> Commission for the <HI>sacred Minister,</HI> standing or in force; which is that same we are speaking of▪ and that CHRIST at his Ascension left no other Officers in power, but his Eleven Apostles. Hence then such as have no Interest in this Commission, can have no Claim to any part of the Office instituted therein, nor may pretend to <HI>Preach</HI> any more than to exercise the powers of Discipline and Orders.</P>
<P>BUT if you assume in the <HI>Affirmative,</HI> and say that Presby∣ters <HI>are</HI> concern'd in this Commission; then I inquire, <HI>How far?</HI> Do's it belong to them in <HI>whole,</HI> or in <HI>part?</HI></P>
<P>IF you say in the <HI>whole;</HI> then it follows there can be no <HI>ordinary</HI> ecclesiastical Officer superior to <HI>Presbyters:</HI> since they are invested with the <HI>highest</HI> Commission in the Church, and with the <HI>one only</HI> Commission for the Ministry. The preten∣ded <HI>Prelates</HI> can act only by virtue of this Commission, and they that act by one and the same Commission, must certainly have equal and the same Powers Different Powers, or various Degrees of Power, must be founded in distinct Commissions.</P>
<P>IF any say, in <HI>part</HI> only; then I inquire in what parts and degrees, and who are sharers with them? Our <HI>Author</HI> resolves the Question, by giving <HI>Presbyters</HI> the power of <HI>Doc∣trine,</HI> and putting into the hands of <HI>Bishops</HI> the powers of <HI>Or∣dination</HI> &amp; <HI>Jurisdiction.</HI> But then I demand a Rule for dividing what GOD has united, and distributing the several parts of this Office into different Hands. Why should not <HI>Presbyters</HI> (if they succeed to the Apostles, in any proper sense or degree) have one part of their ministerial Power as well as another? What is the Reason or Ground for any Discrimination in the matter? Nay, Is it not contrary to the very nature of a proper Succession, that two distinct Officers shou'd share the <HI>ministerial Powers</HI> of the Apostles between them, and that in <HI>unequal Degrees</HI> too? <HI>Division</HI> here makes an <HI>essential Alteration.</HI> Whatever Office is made up out of some other Office, and partakes only of a part of the essential Powers belonging to it, must needs be different from it, and must be call'd a <HI>new</HI> Office. And this is the very Case we have before us. The <HI>Presbyter</HI> (stript of any of the <HI>essential</HI> &amp; <HI>ordinary Powers</HI> of the Aposto∣lic Office) is a Creature of <HI>another</HI> Order, and quite a <HI>new Species;</HI> as much as the <HI>Deacon</HI> was tho' the Former has not (as
<PB N="29" REF="002594_0032_0FDB7E2421F47588"/>
the Latter hath) any <HI>Divine Institution</HI> to support and counte∣nance him, and therefore is to be rejected as an <HI>Unscriptural Officer,</HI> having no proper Title to the Commission and Promise made to the Apostles; however he may pretend to be deriva∣tive from them.</P>
<P>INDEED, Supposing our blessed <HI>Lord</HI> had instituted the several powers which the Apostles had, as 'twere by <HI>halves,</HI> (the power of <HI>Government</HI> separately, and the power of <HI>Doctrine</HI> by it self) in distinct Commissions, both whereof were to be standing; then we might perhaps have reasonably argu'd those Powers capable of existing separately in distinct Subjects: and at this Door, the mere <HI>preaching Presbyter</HI> might come in, and be look'd upon as a <HI>regular Officer;</HI> and not <HI>simply</HI> new, altho' he had differ'd from his Predecessors, the Apostles; looking at their Office <HI>in Complexo,</HI> &amp; taking their Powers all together. Or again, Supposing the <HI>Apostles</HI> (in the name of their ascended Lord) had instituted this new Officer, the mere <HI>preaching Presbyter,</HI> (assigning him out of their Office, only the power of <HI>Doctrine;</HI> as they appointed a distinct Office of <HI>Deacons,</HI> devolving on them the Ministry of <HI>Tables</HI> only) there would (in this case too) have been sufficient Founda∣tion for the simple <HI>Presbyter</HI> or <HI>Preacher,</HI> and we might have lookt upon his Credentials as very authentic.</P>
<P>BUT now I cannot learn that this mere <HI>preaching Presbyter</HI> has any manner of Warrant, upon either of these Hypotheses.</P>
<P>IN short then, If there be any such Officer of CHRIST, as a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> or <HI>Minister of the Word,</HI> he must stand upon that (single) Commission given the Apostles at the Ascension of CHRIST; and so by good Consequence must succeed them in all the ordinary and continuing parts of their Office. I ask then, By what Rule do any distinguish the Power of <HI>Doctrine</HI> and the Power of <HI>Government</HI> from one another, and deny the latter to the Order of <HI>Presbyters?</HI>—To bring this matter to a point, I wou'd argue thus. The power of <HI>Government</HI> be∣long'd to the Apostles either in their <HI>ordinary</HI> or <HI>extraordinary</HI> Capacity. If only in their <HI>Extraordinary,</HI> then no Body a∣mong their Successors has any just Pretences to it. If in their <HI>Ordinary,</HI> then they who succeed them in the power of <HI>Doctrine,</HI> are the Order, to whom alone that <HI>other</HI> Power also of Right belongs: since they who are in any degree properly Successors to the Apostles, must succeed them in the whole of their standing Character, as I have proved before. <HI>Moreover,</HI> I would add here, the Key of Discipline and Rule must needs
<PB N="30" REF="002594_0033_0FDB7E2544C7E080"/>
belong to such as have the Key of Doctrine, for this very significant Reason, Because the <HI>Latter</HI> is the <HI>greater Honour,</HI> and more worthy Badge, of the Two; I don't say in mine and my Brethren's Opinion, but in the Judgment of no less a Person than the inspired <HI>Apostle,</HI> as you may see, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. Now why shou'd the <HI>less</HI> honorable Power be denied them? Here then I demand again, What <HI>Warrant</HI> (or Colour of Rea∣son) have any to deny <HI>Presbyters</HI> the Power of <HI>Government?</HI> Where is the <HI>Scripture</HI> that runs a Line of Distinction between <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters?</HI> Where shall we in all our Bible find the place, that assigns different Successors to the Apostles, and disperseth the ministerial Powers, united in them; committing to one this, and to another that, as distinct Officers in the Church?</P>
<P>BUT now before I pass to our <HI>Authors</HI> other Proofs, I think it proper here a little to anticipate him, and bestow a Reflection or two, upon one declamatory and very harsh Pas∣sage of his, referring to this matter; which we have, in <HI>pag.</HI> 44. <HI>Either</HI> (quoth he) <HI>Bishops</HI> (Diocesan, that is) <HI>must be</HI> THE TRUE <HI>Successors of the Apostles, or else they have no Succes∣sors</HI> AT ALL, <HI>and the Apostolic Order &amp; Office is</HI> QUITE <HI>ex∣tinct; and the Church is</HI> TOTALLY <HI>deprived of the prime and chiefest Office instituted by CHRIST for its Edification, good Or∣der, and Government; and finally, There is now no such Order of Men extant in the World, to whom that</HI> LARGE <HI>and</HI> AMPLE <HI>Commission which CHRIST gave only to his</HI> APOSTLES, <HI>does belong: and with this, the Promise falls too.</HI>—Who now can for∣bear admiring the <HI>Zeal</HI> of this Gentleman, and his wonderful <HI>Reasoning</HI> here! But suffer me to expostulate a little with him upon it.—What! Is there no <HI>possible</HI> way for the <HI>Apostolic Order</HI> to continue, but in the Persons of Diocesan <HI>Bishops!</HI> Must the Apostles be deny'd any <HI>Successors at all,</HI> if his idoliz'd <HI>Prelacy</HI> be deny'd! Has he not taught us to distinguish between <HI>ordinary</HI> and <HI>extraordinary</HI> Powers in the <HI>Apostolate!</HI> And if <HI>presbyters</HI> do succeed to the Apostles in their <HI>ordinary</HI> ministerial Powers (as he hath not proved they do not) are these <HI>no Successors at all!</HI> While the Gospel is preached, and there are those in the world, whom himself (<HI>pag.</HI> 19.) calls <HI>Christ's Ambassadors,</HI> can he say the <HI>Office</HI> is <HI>quite</HI> extinct! And how can he say, The Church is <HI>totally</HI> depriv'd of the chief Office instituted by CHRIST for its Edification, so long as we have the benefit of the <HI>Apostolic Writings,</HI> by which <HI>(being dead) they yet speak.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="002594_0034_0FDB7E2700883330"/>AND finally, Does he complain, That except <HI>Bishops</HI> be allow'd to succeed the Apostles, <HI>There is now no such Order of Men extant in the World, to whom that</HI> LARGE <HI>&amp;</HI> AMPLE <HI>Commission, which CHRIST gave</HI> ONLY <HI>to his Apostles, does belong!</HI> What means the Gentleman by this?</P>
<P>IF he wou'd bear the world in hand, that the Commission, which the Apostles receiv'd, was given to them <HI>only,</HI> and in distinction from <HI>Presbyters;</HI> this is as <HI>gratis dictum;</HI> a Point that needs proof, after all that he hath said upon it.</P>
<P>AND if he wou'd insinuate here, that the Commission gi∣ven the Apostles, doth in its <HI>large</HI> &amp; <HI>ample</HI> Extent descend to their <HI>Successors;</HI> then surely he design'd only to <HI>amuse</HI> his Readers, and he <HI>contradicts</HI> himself t'boot, having forgotten what he had before conceded, (in <HI>pag.</HI> 33.) That <HI>the unlimit∣ted Commission</HI> was a thing <HI>peculiar</HI> to the <HI>first Apostles, extraor∣dinary &amp; temporary:</HI> in saying which, He in effect confesses himself, that <HI>there is no Order of Men extant in the World,</HI> (and therefore not his <HI>Bishops</HI>) <HI>to whom that</HI> AMPLE <HI>&amp;</HI> LARGE <HI>Commission</HI> doth belong: and since he contends, notwithstanding, that <HI>Bishops</HI> are <HI>true</HI> Successors of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> how evidently doth it appear, He allows there may be true Successors to the Apostles, (empower'd by the same Commission with them) who yet are not vested with the same Plenitude of Power that they exercised, or an Authority of the same <HI>am∣ple Extent</HI> with theirs!—And now if the Power of <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> granted in the Apostolical Commission, may come under any Limitations, or be confin'd to a particular Charge; since our <HI>Author</HI> presumes to shrink it up within the narrow Bounds of a <HI>Diocess,</HI> (He says not, whether great or <HI>small</HI>) I may as safely and warrantably contract it a little <HI>more</HI> &amp; reduce it within the Compass of a <HI>single Church</HI> or Congregation. And in this, I have to bear me out, many <HI>Divines</HI> of Name in the <HI>Church of England</HI> it self, who maintain, that <HI>Extent</HI> of Power over <HI>several</HI> Churches, nay, and having <HI>Presbyters</HI> in subordi∣nation too, are not (one nor other) of the <HI>Essence of Episcopacy.</HI> This was the opinion particularly of Dr. <HI>Maurice</HI> (a stre∣nuous Defender of Prelacy) who upon this head observes to us, <Q>That <HI>Milles</HI> the martyr was a <HI>Bishop,</HI> tho' he had <HI>not so much as one</HI> Christian in his Diocese: and he acknowleges, He never yet heard of any men, who made it essential to a Bishop, to have a plurality of Congregations under him <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Tong</HI>'s Def. <HI>pag.</HI> 115.</NOTE>.</Q>
<PB N="32" REF="002594_0035_0FDB7E284754A5E0"/>
So <HI>Saravia</HI> (a prime Leader in the notion of the Divine Right of Prelacy) professeth, <Q>We measure not a <HI>Bishoprick</HI> by the number of the <HI>Clergy,</HI> or by the amplitude of the <HI>Diocess;</HI> for the <HI>Bishoprick</HI> may be included in <HI>one small Parish alone</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See <HI>James. Naz. qu.</HI> pa. 218.</NOTE>.</Q> And it's well known how Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> (a very learned prelatist) maintains, <Q>That all the <HI>Presbyters</HI> we read of in the New Testament were <HI>Bishops,</HI> and that there was <HI>no inferiour Order</HI> of Ministers instituted by CHRIST or his Apostles; but that this was afterwards brought into the Church.</Q></P>
<P>HENCE then, according to these Principles, <HI>Episcopacy</HI> and <HI>Presbyterian Parity</HI> are very well reconcilable: for I know no difference between a Congregational <HI>Bishop,</HI> and an Inde∣pendent <HI>Pastor;</HI> save that the latter may want the <HI>Episcopal Consecration,</HI> which they speak of, and make necessary to the <HI>Authority of the Episcopal Degree.</HI> But surely <HI>that</HI> can afford no plea for the Distinction between Bishops and Presbyters; because there's no solid proof of any Rule in the <HI>sacred Scrip∣tures,</HI> for this Consecration of Bishops, as different from the Ordination of Presbyters. I will boldly affirm, They may turn over all the Leaves of their Bible, as long as they have Eyes to see, and not be able to produce a Scripture-Canon for any thing more than <HI>Ministerial</HI> Ordination. Nay in the, Very <HI>Directory</HI> for Ordination, (<HI>Tit.</HI> 1.) the Apostle makes no Distinction in the least between <HI>Presbyters</HI> &amp; <HI>Bishops,</HI> but rather makes them the very <HI>same,</HI> as I shall show by'n'by.— However we will not quarrel and part <HI>here:</HI> Nay, and more∣over I will for once grant them, That <HI>Bishops are the true Suc∣cessors of the Apostles; deriving from them the power of Ordination &amp; Jurisdiction;</HI> this, I say I will grant them, if they will but hold to those two Principles, (which we find them sometimes allowing us,) <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>every Congregation may have its own partieular Bishop; and then that all Bishops are upon the Level, having equal &amp; independent Authority.</HI></P>
<P>YEA, If they'll allow these two things, I will grant them further, That the <HI>Promise,</HI> annexed to the Apostles Com∣mission, <HI>does belong to Bishops;</HI> and so the <HI>horrid consequences</HI> we may hope will be prevented, which our <HI>Author</HI> conceives would follow, if Bishops be not the true Successors of the Apostles.</P>
<P><PB N="33" REF="002594_0036_0FDB7E29C830AE00"/>THUS at last, I think, we are led into a way, to per¦petuate <HI>the prime Office instituted by CHRIST for the Church Edification, good Order &amp; Government,</HI> and to secure the great <HI>Promise</HI> made to the <HI>Apostolical Order,</HI> by a regular Succession of <HI>Bishops</HI> too: and yet consistent enough with the <HI>Presbyterial</HI> Model.</P>
<P>AND so it appears, the <HI>first</HI> Text, that our <HI>Author</HI> brings to support the prelatical scheme, proves of no subserviency at all to his purpose, but much the contrary.</P>
<P>I have been drawn to a greater length in the consideration of this Text, because I perceive the <HI>Gentleman</HI> lays pecu∣liar Stress upon it; referring us frequently and with great assurance to the <HI>Commission</HI> there: and because I think as to this he is in the Right; for I believe, we have <HI>here</HI> (to use some of <HI>his</HI> words) <HI>the Hinge, on which the whole Contro∣versy in this matter depends</HI> And verily, if <HI>Presbyters</HI> are absolutely shut out of <HI>this</HI> Commission, I shall despair of finding any other Establishment for them, in the whole Bible. Or if <HI>Bishops</HI> have by virtue of this Commission a Right of Juris∣diction over Presbyters, or any Power but what <HI>Presbyters</HI> have as well as they a Title to, this wou'd decide the Case with me: and I shou'd think it almost needless to take the pains to examin any <HI>other</HI> Scripture-Proofs he has to bring. But being, after the most impartial search into the matter, strongly convinced of the <HI>contrary,</HI> I shall proceed to the other Texts he brings, and see whether they can afford any <HI>new Light</HI> to the Argument.</P>
<P>THO' I wou'd premise here one Thing, as a <HI>Principle,</HI> not to be disputed; <HI>viz.</HI> That this <HI>first Text,</HI> as containing the <HI>Gospel-Charter</HI> or Commission for the Ministry, must therefore be admitted the grand <HI>RULE</HI> to us in interpreting other Texts, relating to the <HI>Controversy.</HI> All must be reduced to <HI>this</HI> Standard; and no Construction of any Scripture be al∣low'd, that makes it <HI>militate</HI> with this first and grand Text. We must note; All <HI>Corporations</HI> are to model their Go∣vernment by their <HI>Charter,</HI> and by the Instructions of their original Founder: no Laws are to be enacted <HI>repugnant</HI> to these; and all Laws already made, are to be <HI>interpreted</HI> in a sense plainly <HI>consistent</HI> therewith—. As then we may justly reject any Decrees or Ordinances of <HI>Men,</HI> that pretend to alter, limit, or add to the standing Powers of the Divine Commission aforesaid: So we may reasonably suspect that <HI>Exposition</HI> of any
<PB N="34" REF="002594_0037_0FDB7E2C08347AA8"/>
<HI>Text,</HI> which makes it to <HI>interfere</HI> with this. And hence, tho' some particular Texts cou'd be produced, that might by a witty Turn be made to look favourably towards the <HI>Distinction</HI> between Bishops and Presbyters: yet if this Distinction cannot consist with the Royal CHARTER, or cannot be deduced from it by any rational Inferences, we must necessarily look out for some other sense of those Texts, and reject the for∣mer Construction as certainly erroneous.</P>
<P>I shall only add here what one well observes; This being <Q>a Question concerning a very great Power, extending to a great Number of Persons, and producing great Effects, a matter of great Distinction, and Dependencies, ought to have clear and positive Warrant from the Word of GOD, and be very plainly legible in the Commission there. Meer <HI>Names, Titles, Suppositions,</HI> and fine <HI>Probabilities,</HI> will not all make a Foundation strong enough, to bear the weight of a structure so high and towering, as our English Prelacy.</Q></P>
<P>WELL, we will now examin our <HI>Author</HI>'s other Scripture-Proofs, and see what weight they will bear to have laid upon them.</P>
<P>HIS <HI>second</HI> Text is, 1 Cor. 12.28. <HI>Where the Apostle</HI> Paul <HI>tells us, GOD hath set some in the Church, first</HI> APOSTLES, <HI>secondly</HI> PROPHETS, <HI>thirdly</HI> TEACHERS.— Here, by the way he inserts in a Parenthesis this observation, That <HI>what follow, are not distinct Offices from these, but extraordinary Gifts conferred upon them.</HI> But I believe his Observation will not hold good, as to all the Articles in the following Enumera∣tion; For what will he make of the <HI>Helps</HI> and <HI>Governments,</HI> mention'd there? Do not these mean <HI>distinct Officers?</HI> I am sure many learned Interpreters judge so: and among others, some of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> Particularly, Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> (from Dr. <HI>Lightfoot</HI>) says on the place, That the <HI>Helps</HI> here were <HI>Deacons,</HI> or such Officers as took Care of the Poor: and by <HI>Governments,</HI> he tells us, <HI>are almost generally understood the</HI> Rulers <HI>of the churches planted by the Apostles.</HI></P>
<P>HOWEVER, Supposing them to be (what he calls them, <HI>pag.</HI> 14.) <HI>only various Powers &amp; Gifts, wherewith the Gospel-Officers were endu'd;</HI> how will this serve his Cause! Nay, it will very much hurt it. For, to <HI>whom</HI> shall we refer these <HI>Powers?</HI> Surely not the <HI>Apostles</HI> only, but as well to the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> joyned with them. Whence it will necessarily fol∣low, That <HI>Teachers</HI> have the powers of <HI>Government</HI> belonging
<PB N="35" REF="002594_0038_0FDB7E304227F8B0"/>
to them; and therefore the power of <HI>Ordination</HI> also, since these two are inseperably united, in the Episcopal Scheme. And accordingly Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> on the place (agreeing with our <HI>Author</HI> in his Interpretation of <HI>Governments</HI>) do's expresly ascribe and appropriate these <HI>ruling Powers</HI> (as his Phrase is) to the <HI>Teachers</HI> spoken of, whom he makes to be the <HI>Pastors of particular Churches planted by the Apostles.</HI>— We will not dis∣pute then with our Author, whether the <HI>Apostolic Degree be per∣petual,</HI> or not; but let him enjoy his opinion about it, and make as much of it as he can: <HI>provided</HI> he will but concur with those his Brethren, (and let <HI>us</HI> quietly enjoy <HI>our</HI> opinion) <HI>That the</HI> Teachers or Pastors <HI>of particular Congregations have these</HI> ruling <HI>Powers belonging to them.</HI></P>
<P>YET, it would make one smile to see how he lays stress upon the word SET, and to read his Descant on it; when if we consider the <HI>place</HI> this monosyllable bears in the Text, it must needs be of little weight in the present Argument, as referring indifferently to <HI>all</HI> that follows; and consequently taking in (not only the <HI>Apostles,</HI> &amp;c. but likewise) the <HI>extraordinary Gifts &amp; Powers</HI> there enumerated, as <HI>set in the Church,</HI> and so (according to him) <HI>immoveably fixed</HI> as the Ordinances of Heaven: which, how <HI>ridiculous</HI> wou'd it be to pretend! In short, This <HI>Gentleman</HI> must allow the power of working <HI>Mi∣racles,</HI> the <HI>Gift of Interpreting,</HI> and the <HI>Diversities of Tongues,</HI> to be but <HI>temporary,</HI> even altho' they are said to be SET in the Church: and now the <HI>Apostolic</HI> power of universal Inspection might be but in the <HI>same sense</HI> set in the Church, and have <HI>a respect</HI> (like the rest of those extraordinary Powers) <HI>only to the first planting of the Gospel,</HI> as himself expresly owns, <HI>Pag.</HI> 33, 34.</P>
<P>SO that it is egregious <HI>Trifling</HI> to use this Scripture, as a proof of his Scheme: and his <HI>Distinction</HI> here between <HI>Offices</HI> and <HI>Gifts,</HI> is nothing to his purpose, tho' (as you've heard) it's much to <HI>mine.</HI> And as for his <HI>Admonition</HI> (under this head) to such as <HI>presume to mutilate &amp; deform the</HI> mystical <HI>Body of CHRIST, by depriving the Church of any of the sacred Offices set in it by GOD;</HI> we humbly trust on <HI>our</HI> part no such Censure is due, however it was pointed at <HI>us;</HI> and therefore let the <HI>Bestower</HI> of it, and his Brethren, take it among them∣selves, who presume to robb the <HI>Presbyters</HI> in the Church of a great part of their Ministerial Powers, &amp; commit them to other Officers uninstituted by CHRIST, to the no small damage of his Church in its <HI>Beauty, Integrity</HI> and <HI>Purity.</HI>— But I
<PB N="36" REF="002594_0039_0FDB7E3140B824A0"/>
forbear; as supposing <HI>Re-criminations</HI> however just, will do but little Service to my Cause.</P>
<P>TO <HI>go on</HI> with our <HI>Author:</HI> In the <HI>third</HI> place, He argues from the 4th Chap. to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> where we are told, That our Lord <HI>gave some Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, some Pastors &amp; Teachers, — for the edifying the Body of Christ; till we all come— unto a perfect Man,</HI>— That we henceforth <HI>be no more Children tossed to &amp; fro,</HI> &amp;c.— Now he boasts he has here an <HI>uncontestible Testimony,</HI> in favor of his Scheme, <HI>taken from the Ends for which these Offices were instituted; with an ex∣press Declaration how long they were to continue,</HI> that is, <HI>to the End of the world.</HI>— But this is very easily answered. 'Tis granted, That the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and others must certainly <HI>accomplish</HI> the Ends they were given for, some way or other. And there are two ways, agreable to the twofold Capacity they sustain'd, Ordinary and Extraordinary.</P>
<P>IF you consider the <HI>Apostles</HI> here, in their <HI>Ordinary</HI> Capacity, the Case is very plain: their Order doth <HI>actually continue;</HI> and they do properly in their <HI>Successors,</HI> serve to the Edification, good Order &amp; Government of the Church, and will do so to the End of Time. Which <HI>Successors</HI> are <HI>Gospel-Teachers</HI> or <HI>Elders.</HI> For since our <HI>Author</HI> has not yet been able to prove, That a <HI>Superiority over other Pastors</HI> was one of the <HI>ordinary</HI> and stand∣ing Parts of the Apostolic Office, it thence follows, that <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> may well enough be look'd upon, as <HI>Successors</HI> to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and we have no Reason to think any <HI>superior Order to them</HI> was to continue in the Church. For, as he truly observes, <HI>pag.</HI> 42. The Question between us is only concerning the <HI>Or∣dinary</HI> Powers of the Apostles, in which <HI>alone</HI> they cou'd have <HI>Successors.</HI> And he <HI>himself</HI> (as I took notice before) acknow∣leges, That a <HI>Jurisdiction over all Churches &amp; Pastors</HI> was one of those <HI>Extraordinary</HI> Powers, of which he says (as expresly as I can) at the foot of <HI>pag.</HI> 41. That <HI>they expired with themselves, and that they have no Successors in them.</HI></P>
<P>IF then, on the other hand, you consider the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their <HI>Extraordinary</HI> Capacity, you have our <HI>Author</HI>'s own Confession, that in <HI>this</HI> they had <HI>no</HI> Successors; nor <HI>were to have</HI> any: and so their Superintendent Power being extraordinary, was not to continue in <HI>after Ages,</HI> nor is it obligatory to <HI>us. For</HI> (he says, <HI>pag</HI> 32.) <HI>if the Institution</HI> of the Apostles <HI>was ex∣traordinary &amp; temporary in any part, it is so far as it was of this nature, no Rule or Standard now.</HI> Nevertheless (I would add)

After a sort and in an improper sense, even the <HI>first Apostles</HI> may be said to continue, that is, In the blessed <HI>Effects</HI> of their Ministry; and to be still serving the Church of CHRIST, by the <HI>Apostolical Doctrine,</HI> and the standing Rule of Faith deli∣ver'd to us in the New Testament; which, as Men infallibly inspired for that End, they wrote, and publish'd, to be han∣ded down to Posterity, and spread through the world, for the common benefit of mankind. And these Apostolical <HI>Writings</HI> have been preserved to this day, and will (I trust) be to the world's End continu'd, the great Instrument of the Conversion and Edification of Souls, under the Conduct of the Spirit of GOD, and of his Ministers, as in subordination to him, Workers together with GOD, and building upon the Foundation, which those <HI>Master-builders</HI> have laid. So that, in this qualify'd sense, the <HI>Apostles</HI> may be said, even in their <HI>extraordinary</HI> Capacity, yea, and by their <HI>Superintendent</HI> Power too, in the lasting Effects and Influences of it, to continue, <HI>for the work of the Ministry, till we all come,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>BUT here I have <HI>two Remarks</HI> further to make; one on the Author's <HI>way</HI> of <HI>Reasoning</HI> upon this Text; and a second, Upon the <HI>Objection</HI> he raises, with his <HI>Answer</HI> to it.</P>
<P>HERE then I cannot but take notice, How remarkably this <HI>Gentleman,</HI> in his manner of arguing from this Place (for his pretended Bishop) agrees with the <HI>Popish</HI> Doctors; who from the very same Text (as Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> observes) do argue for an <HI>infallible</HI> Guide <HI>thus;— CHRIST</HI> (say they) <HI>gave Apostles, Pastors, &amp; Teachers, that Christians might not be</HI> tossed to and fro <HI>with every wind of Doctrine; which End cou'd not be compassed but by</HI> infallible <HI>Guides.</HI> Moreover, <HI>GOD gave such Pastors to serve to these Ends,</HI> till we all come <HI>to the unity of the Faith, which will not be till the</HI> last <HI>days of all. Where∣fore, till</HI> the End <HI>of the World, the Church must be provided of them, and by them be secured from being Children tossed to and fro.</HI> Thus the <HI>Papists</HI> argue. And perhaps <HI>They</HI> have as much <HI>Truth</HI> on their side, as our <HI>Author.</HI> Besure their Argument seems to be as well founded and as plausible, for a perpetual Succession of <HI>infallible Guides</HI> in the Church▪ as his for a perpetual Suc∣cession of Apostolical <HI>Superintendents.</HI> But since the INFAL∣LIBLE CHAIR is expresly renounced by this <HI>Gentleman</HI> him∣self, and that consistently with the Text we are upon; Me∣thinks, it's pity he did not proceed (as he might have done, upon equally just Grounds) to reject the EPISCOPAL
<PB N="38" REF="002594_0041_0FDB7E3456EF3740"/>
THRONE together with it. However, <HI>we</HI> will do it, tho' he hasn't; as firmly believing, that <HI>Infallibility</HI> &amp; <HI>Superintendency</HI> were both alike <HI>peculiar</HI> to the <HI>first</HI> Apostles (to speak in his own Dialect) and being equally design'd only to serve the <HI>Infancy</HI> and first Constitution of the Church, they were not to continue.</P>
<P>THE <HI>other Thing</HI> I mention'd, may now be consider'd. He is aware, it might be <HI>objected</HI> to him, <HI>That in this Text</HI> (viz. Eph. 4.11.) <HI>more Officers are mention'd than he pleads for;</HI> and therefore, to keep clear of the opinion of many Dissenters, That the <HI>Apostles, Prophets</HI> and <HI>Evangelists</HI> here spoken of, were <HI>extraordinary</HI> Officers, He is forced to say, That <HI>these different Designations do not import different</HI> Offices, <HI>but different</HI> Exercises <HI>of the same Office,</HI> (pag. 38.) — But here, how obvious and natural is the Reflection, That by this Principle there is but ONE SINGLE Order in the <HI>Gospel-Ministry;</HI> which is the Thing I am pleading for, and to allow which, is for him intirely to give up the Argument. If <HI>Apostles, Prophets, Evan∣gelists, Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> do all import only <HI>one</HI> and <HI>the same Officer,</HI> under various Denominations, as our <HI>Author</HI> seems positively to assert, then I say there's an <HI>End</HI> of the Contro∣versy, and what need we stay any longer upon it!— How∣ever, let us see how he illustrates the matter by an <HI>Example,</HI> saying, That <HI>an Apostle, Presbyter, or Deacon, might be a Prophet, Evangelist, Doctor or Teacher:</HI>— In which, I doubt he still more and more involves himself, and disparages his Cause.</P>
<P>For observe,</P>
<P N="1">1. THERE's a <HI>Fallacy</HI> in this Instance, in that one thing which should be in the <HI>Predicate,</HI> He puts into the place of the <HI>Subject,</HI> namely, an <HI>Apostle.</HI> If he wou'd speak consistently with the Account he gives before, of these <HI>different Designations,</HI> and give a <HI>parallel</HI> Instance, It must run thus, A <HI>Presbyter</HI> or <HI>Deacon,</HI> (or a <HI>third</HI> Person, if he could find out such an one; let him say, a <HI>Bishop,</HI> if he will) might be an <HI>Apostle, Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor</HI> or <HI>Teacher.</HI> For <HI>Apostle</HI> is one of those <HI>Desig∣nations</HI> in the Text; all which just now he said, imported only <HI>different Exercises</HI> of the same Office.</P>
<P>BUT if any will attempt to excuse him from the Charge of a Fallacy, by saying, He meant to <HI>except</HI> the <HI>Apostles</HI> out of that Number, and spoke only of the <HI>other</HI> Designations that follow; tho' it happens not to be so cautiously worded: then let me argue upon the matter thus,— <HI>Either all the Designa∣tions here do import distinct</HI> Offices, <HI>or they all of them do not.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="39" REF="002594_0042_0FDB7E35B30D0010"/>IF <HI>all</HI> do imply distinct <HI>Offices;</HI> then these are all either ordinary or extraordinary, and take them in which sense he will, he must distort his own Scheme. Nay further, if any shou'd say for him, <HI>They are</HI> BOTH (some being Ordinary, and others Extraordinary) and to be taken <HI>in sensu diviso;</HI> I doubt this Distinction would not help him neither: for I be∣lieve, by the same Rules that <HI>any</HI> of them can be prov'd <HI>Ex∣traordinary,</HI> we must conclude the <HI>Apostles</HI> particularly to be so. And then what becomes of the <HI>Bishop,</HI> our <HI>Author</HI>'s pre∣tended <HI>Successor</HI> to the Apostles!</P>
<P>BUT, If all these Designations do <HI>not</HI> imply so many dif∣ferent <HI>Offices,</HI> then I argue thus,— Either they are <HI>some</HI> of them proper Offices, and <HI>others</HI> only different <HI>Exercises;</HI> or else they are all but <HI>Exercises</HI> of one Office.</P>
<P>IF he chuse to say the <HI>Former;</HI> then I ask, <HI>How many,</HI> and <HI>which</HI> of them are <HI>Offices?</HI> He'll doubtless say particularly <HI>Apostles,</HI> and <HI>Prophets,</HI> which (<HI>pag.</HI> 14.) he says, <HI>is the name that the order of the</HI> 70 <HI>go by.</HI> But then I demand, By what Laws of Interpretation, he can support this Construction? Where is there any Colour of <HI>Distinction</HI> in the Text, between These and the Rest that follow? Does not the Enumeration run thus, <HI>some</HI> Apostles, <HI>and some</HI> Prophets, <HI>and some</HI> Evangelists, <HI>and some</HI> Pastors and Teachers! So that there's no <HI>mark</HI> of Distinction between the two First, and the Rest: and more∣over, by the same Rule, that the two First, viz. <HI>Apostles</HI> and <HI>Prophets,</HI> may be distinguish'd one from the other, may also the two next, <HI>Evangelists</HI> &amp; <HI>Pastors,</HI> be distinguish'd, and call'd different Offices. Yea, and by parity of Reason, If he calls <HI>Evangelists</HI> &amp; <HI>Pastors</HI> one and the same Officer, I may as well call <HI>Apostles</HI> and Pastors the same. According to him, a <HI>Pres∣byter</HI> might be a <HI>Prophet, Evangelist, Pastor</HI> or <HI>Teacher:</HI> and I will add upon as good Grounds, <HI>That he might be an</HI> Apostle <HI>too,</HI> as far as the <HI>ordinary</HI> Power of an Apostle extended; which was only to <HI>govern</HI> the Church, <HI>ordain</HI> Officers, <HI>preach</HI> the <HI>Word,</HI> &amp; <HI>administer</HI> the <HI>Sacraments:</HI> for (I say again) he hath not yet proved, That a <HI>Superiority</HI> over other Pastors was one of the <HI>ordinary</HI> powers of an Apostle.— And by the way, This would have served as well for an Answer to one of his former Texts, that is, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12 28. For there is as much Rea∣son to suppose the <HI>different Designations</HI> in <HI>that,</HI> as in this, to <HI>import only different Exercises of the same Office.</HI>— But thus much for the first Thing I observ'd in our <HI>Author</HI>'s Instance.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="40" REF="002594_0043_0FDB7E3B38CDBB98"/>2. OBSERVE a very palpable <HI>Self-Contradiction</HI> (if not also another <HI>Fallacy</HI>) in what he affirms here of the <HI>Deacon,</HI> viz. <HI>That He</HI> (as well as a Presbyter or an Apostle) <HI>might be a Prophet, Evangelist, Doctor, or Teacher.</HI></P>
<P>HERE's a plain <HI>Contradiction</HI> to what he says elsewhere. For, those several <HI>Designations,</HI> he expresly tells us (<HI>pag.</HI> 14. and again, <HI>pa.</HI> 21.) belong to the <HI>second Order</HI> of Ministers, viz. <HI>Presbyters.</HI> And then, in <HI>pag.</HI> 58. he says, <HI>The Apostles instituted a</HI> 3d <HI>Order, of Deacons, who 'tis certain was</HI> inferior <HI>to Presbyters, as these were to the Apostles.</HI>— Yet here, <HI>pag.</HI> 38. He affirms, That a <HI>Deacon</HI> might be a <HI>Prophet, Evangelist, Doctor,</HI> or <HI>Teacher.</HI>—Now let any one reconcile these Things, that can. If <HI>Deacons</HI> may wear all the distinguishing <HI>Titles,</HI> and do all the peculiar <HI>Works</HI> of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> I cannot imagine how any <HI>Distinction</HI> of <HI>Order</HI> can be supposed between them. At least, if so, it can't be apprehended that <HI>Deacons</HI> are the <HI>Inferior</HI> Or∣der of the two. For, tho' some particular <HI>Names</HI> &amp; <HI>Works</HI> may be <HI>common</HI> (as our <HI>Author</HI> observes, <HI>pag.</HI> 55.) <HI>where Offices are acknowleged to be distinct:</HI> Yet it is ever the <HI>Superior Office includes the inferior,</HI> (as, all <HI>Apostles</HI> were Presbyters and Dea∣cons,) but not <HI>vice versa;</HI> to use his own words in <HI>pag.</HI> 56. According to which Principle of our <HI>Author</HI>'s, a <HI>Deacon</HI> can't be <HI>inferior</HI> to a Presbyter, if he may be a <HI>Prophet, Evangelist,</HI> &amp;c. for what more can we suppose a <HI>Presbyter</HI> to be? What <HI>de∣stinctive</HI> Character doth a Presbyter sustain? What <HI>Superior</HI> to these? Unless he will grant that a Presbyter might be an <HI>Apostle.</HI></P>
<P>IN Fine, There appears to be another <HI>Fallacy,</HI> in our <HI>Author</HI>'s <HI>varying</HI> from the Enumeration in the Text, by saying DOCTOR <HI>or Teacher,</HI> instead of PASTOR <HI>or Teacher.</HI> It seems plainly to be a <HI>design'd</HI> Alteration. For, <HI>first,</HI> He knew well enough, that <HI>Doctor</HI> here was a <HI>superfluous</HI> word, since it is synonimous with <HI>Teacher:</HI> However, because of the Gingle of the word, he suppos'd the changing of <HI>Pastor</HI> for <HI>Doctor,</HI> wou'd not be readily minded. And <HI>then,</HI> He knew, if he had asserted, A <HI>Deacon,</HI> or an <HI>Apostle,</HI> (both which he was speaking of) might be a <HI>Pastor;</HI> [that is, <HI>A Minister of the Word &amp; Sacra∣ments, setled in a particular Church, or Place that had receiv'd the Gospel;</HI> for so he defines a <HI>Pastor; pag.</HI> 14. &amp; 25. compar'd] all the World would have derided the Absurdity, and every one seen the notorious <HI>Opposition,</HI> that this wou'd have carry'd in it, to his <HI>own Scheme:</HI> according to which, as the <HI>Apostles</HI> had an <HI>unlimited</HI> Commission, and a <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> over
<PB N="41" REF="002594_0044_0FDB7E3C7380C0E0"/>
Pastors; So the <HI>Deacon</HI> is confin'd to <HI>Preaching</HI> &amp; <HI>Baptising,</HI> not being authorized to administer the <HI>Lord's Supper;</HI> which every <HI>Pastor</HI> has certainly power to do: and hence neither an <HI>Apostle</HI> nor <HI>Deacon</HI> cou'd be a <HI>Pastor.</HI> It was then wittily done of him to <HI>change</HI> the Phrase of his Text, and put <HI>Doctor</HI> in∣stead of Pastor. However, The <HI>Wit</HI> (I believe) will hardly <HI>atone</HI> for the <HI>Fallacy.</HI></P>
<P>THUS I have fully and impartially consider'd the <HI>Three</HI> great Scripture-Arguments he brings.</P>
<P>AND now upon the whole, Who can forbear pitying his <HI>Cause</HI> as desperate, that needs the help of such little <HI>Tricks</HI> and <HI>Windings</HI> and <HI>Double-Dealings</HI> to maintain it; and the <HI>Man,</HI> as very forgetful at least, and not a Master of his own Scheme, that commits such egregious <HI>Blunders</HI> &amp; <HI>Self Contradictions!</HI></P>
<P>WELL; Our Author having (as he thinks) establish't his Point, viz <HI>That Authoritative Inspection over Churches &amp; Pastors, was one of the ordinary &amp; continuing parts of the Apostolick Office, in which they were to have Successors;</HI> He comes now in the 4th &amp; <HI>last</HI> place, to shew, that BISHOPS are the true <HI>Successors</HI> of the Apostles, and that in <HI>Them</HI> is the <HI>Apostolical Government</HI> over Pastors &amp; Teachers <HI>continu'd</HI> in the Church. Now to illustrate and confirm this, he observes to us, <HI>Pag.</HI> 43. That the <HI>Apostle∣ship</HI> is (in <HI>Acts</HI> 1.20.) expresly call'd an <HI>Episcopacy;</HI> and hence <HI>the Apostles were properly and actually Bishops.</HI>— Says he so? Why then, at the same Rate of arguing, We may infer that <HI>Presbyters</HI> are <HI>Bishops</HI> too; because in another Chapter of the same Book, (viz. Act. 20.) <HI>The Elders</HI> of <HI>Ephesus</HI> are expresly call'd <HI>Overseers</HI> or <HI>Bishops.</HI> Yea, by the same Rule, we may argue that the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves were properly and actually <HI>Presbyters;</HI> inasmuch as two of them, <HI>Peter</HI> &amp; <HI>John,</HI> expresly call themselves so. The Apostle <HI>John</HI> in two of his Epistles, salutes his Friends, under no other Name, than that chosen one, <HI>The Elder</HI> —. Possibly he was the oldest Apostle now living, or the only one surviving, of that extraordinary Cha∣racter: and this aged Servant of the Lord, willing to counte∣nance the <HI>continu'd</HI> &amp; <HI>standing</HI> Ministry, assumed only the more ordinary and common Title of <HI>Elder:</HI> though, being now the first and most eminent Minister in the Church, he styles himself emphatically, <HI>THE Elder.</HI> — And then the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> exhorting the <HI>Presbyters</HI> (1 Epist 5 1.) styles himself <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Consenior,</HI> or FELLOW <HI>Presbyter;</HI> as if he claimed no Superiority over them and stood upon a Level with them.— But where now do we find these or any other
<PB N="42" REF="002594_0045_0FDB7E3E194C9FA0"/>
Apostles calling themselves <HI>Bishops?</HI> Doubtless we shou'd have been told of it, if they had done so. Besure if the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> had call'd himself a <HI>Fellow-Bishop,</HI> in writing to <HI>Timothy</HI> or <HI>Titus,</HI> there had been Noise &amp; Rattle enough about it.— But what does the Gentleman intend, when he affirms, <HI>That the Apostles were</HI> actually <HI>and properly Bishops?</HI> If he means, that they were actually <HI>Diocesan</HI> Bishops, and had particular Charges or Provinces to rule in; this will <HI>contradict</HI> what he says elsewhere, when he assigns them an <HI>unlimited Commission.</HI> Or if he means that the <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> they (every one in com∣mon) exercised over <HI>all</HI> Churches &amp; Pastors, was a <HI>proper Episcopacy,</HI> as his Phrase is; then I inquire, whether his <HI>limited</HI> Prelate be not <HI>improperly</HI> styled a <HI>Bishop;</HI> and how he can be call'd a <HI>true Successor</HI> of the <HI>Apostles!</HI>— But it may be he only meant in <HI>general,</HI> That they were <HI>Bishops,</HI> as being a <HI>superior Order</HI> to Presbyters and exerting <HI>Authority</HI> over them. If so; then he trifles strangely, and abuses his Reader with the <HI>Ambiguity</HI> of a word, which <HI>He</HI> puts one Construction up∣on, and the Presbyterians another. <HI>He</HI> uses the word. <HI>Bishop,</HI> in the modern <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Sense, as importing an Officer <HI>superior</HI> to a Presbyter: but <HI>We</HI> affirm, this is not the ancient <HI>scriptural</HI> Sense. Let them, who say it is, produce any place in the Bible, where the word is so used, if they can. It is to be found 6 or 7 times in the New Testament: but it every where makes so evidently against the <HI>Prelatical</HI> Sense, that the wiser &amp; more sober Prelatists generally <HI>shun</HI> all Places where the Word is used, as being nothing to their purpose, but rather tending to the Confusion of their Cause. And when they come to answer our Arguments from such Places, they will not fix on any positive Sense contrary to our's, but only study <HI>Evasions;</HI> and act like cowardly Soldiers flying from a powerful Enemy, who trust to their <HI>Heels,</HI> not to their <HI>Weapons:</HI> or if any have more Courage, and resolve at all Ad∣ventures to stand it out, how often do they charge upon one another, and fly in each other's Face!— To Instance in one Text, <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.1. Where <HI>Paul</HI> salutes the Saints at <HI>Philippi, with the Bishops &amp; Deacons.</HI> One Party of them says, Those were <HI>Diocesan</HI> Bishops; and here they take quite different paths: One says, <HI>They were the Bishops of the</HI> neighboring <HI>Citys, met for some Consultation at</HI> Philippi: Another says, <HI>No; They were not at</HI> Philippi, <HI>but with</HI> Paul. Again, One says, These Bishops were <HI>Pastors</HI> and Rulers of Churches, and had <HI>no Presbyters</HI> under them; no such inferior Order being instituted
<PB N="43" REF="002594_0046_0FDB7E3F74065430"/>
by the Apostles: but then another says, There <HI>was</HI> such an <HI>Inferior</HI> Order, and would have it denoted here by the <HI>Deacons.</HI> Yet further, There's another Party, who say, These Bishops were <HI>nothing</HI> but Presbyters; <HI>simple</HI> Presbyters, not having power of Jurisdiction; which the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their times reserved to Themselves; and so there was no such Officer as a <HI>Prelate</HI> between the Apostles, and the Presbyters, Finally, There are some of them, who hold, That by <HI>Bishops</HI> here are to be understood <HI>both</HI> the <HI>Bishop</HI> and his <HI>Presbyters;</HI> for that the Name was then common to both Orders, and the higher Rank includes the lower.— What Contention and Confusion is here among the learned Advocates for <HI>Prelacy!</HI> You see this <HI>one</HI> Text has so gravel'd 'em, that they know not which way to turn themselves, nor how to come off: they can't agree among themselves upon any tolerable Evasion, and they seem asham'd of one another's sophistical Attempts.</P>
<P>BUT I now return to our <HI>Author;</HI> who to confirm the Point he is upon, viz. <HI>That</HI> Bishops <HI>are Successors to the Apostles in their power &amp; Authority over Pastors,</HI> proceeds (<HI>pag.</HI> 45.) to offer another Argument, taken from the <HI>Apostles conferring upon</HI> others <HI>the Apostolick Power, in their own Time, which</HI> (says he) <HI>they would never have done, if they had not concluded it was to be</HI> transmitted <HI>from them to others in a continual Succession, to the</HI> End <HI>of the World.</HI> I might make several <HI>Remarks</HI> on this Pas∣sage; but I shall confine my self to the main Thing, that is, to inquire into the Truth of his <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> That <HI>Apostles</HI> did <HI>actually confer</HI> Apostolic <HI>Power</HI> on <HI>others.</HI> — It is not enough to say there were <HI>other</HI> Apostles, besides those <HI>Eleven,</HI> which CHRIST left in Office at his Ascension. For <HI>our Lord</HI> might afterwards raise up as many as he pleased: but if their <HI>Call</HI> was <HI>immediate,</HI> their Mission from CHRIST alone, without the Intervention of Men, or their Qualifications <HI>extraordinary</HI> And <HI>peculiar,</HI> it affords no Argument at all of his designing a perpetual <HI>Succession</HI> of an Order of Gospel-Ministers, <HI>superior</HI> to ordinary Teachers. Hence then our <HI>Author</HI> must instance in such as receiv'd the <HI>Apostolate</HI> in an <HI>ordinary</HI> manner, by a <HI>human</HI> Call and Ordination: or else his instances are foreign to the purpose, and prove nothing.</P>
<P>NOW in <HI>Pag.</HI> 45 &amp; 46. He offers several Instances; but such as will hardly bear an Examination He first instances in <HI>Matthias:</HI> But will he say this Apostle was called in an <HI>ordinary</HI> manner? Nay, Does he not own himself, It was <HI>by the</HI>
<PB N="44" REF="002594_0047_0FDB7E43F67037E0"/>
DIRECTION <HI>of GOD, that</HI> Matthias <HI>was received into the Num∣ber of the Apostles?</HI> And were not the <HI>Circumstances</HI> and the <HI>Requisites,</HI> that are mention'd (<HI>Act.</HI> 1.21, 22.) as necessary to qualify him to be joyned with the Eleven Apostles; I say, were not these things <HI>extraordinary?</HI> It would then astonish one to think, any Man in his Wits shou'd offer such an In∣stance as this in Plea for <HI>Bishops</HI> being the true Successors of the Apostles!— The Instance of <HI>James,</HI> is exceeding imperti∣nent; since it appears very plainly the <HI>Author</HI> himself believ'd <HI>him</HI> to be one of the <HI>Twelve;</HI> and therefore to have his Call <HI>immediately</HI> from <HI>CHRIST.</HI> And as for what he insinuates about this Apostle's being <HI>Bishop</HI> of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> nothing that he refers us to for proof, will bear him out in this fond Conceit. The next Instance he brings is <HI>Paul;</HI> but with what propriety I can't imagin; especially since he himself confesses, that he was <HI>immediately</HI> called by CHRIST.— His last Instance is <HI>Barnabas,</HI> who (he tells us) was called in the ORDINARY <HI>manner;</HI> that is, He had not an <HI>immediate</HI> Divine Call, but the <HI>Apostles</HI> conferred his Apostolical Power upon him. But how does that appear? Sure I am, we read of no such Thing in the place he refers us to, <HI>Act.</HI> 4.36. Nay, we have very sufficient Grounds to conclude, that <HI>Barnabas,</HI> when he received this new Name from the Apostles, was no more than a <HI>Teacher</HI> or <HI>Evangelist.</HI> We don't hear of his doing any thing more than <HI>preaching the Word,</HI> for a considerable Time after this. Nay, not till after (what we read of, <HI>Acts</HI> 13.) his <HI>Seperation</HI> (together with <HI>Paul</HI>) to a special Ministry, by the hands of <HI>certain Teachers,</HI> at the Direction of the <HI>Holy Ghost:</HI> After which indeed we find him call'd an <HI>Apostle,</HI> ordaining <HI>Elders,</HI> &amp;c. Here then, There are two Things our <HI>Author</HI> must grant. 1. If <HI>Barnabas</HI> was an Apostle really, and seperated to his Apostleship in an <HI>ordinary</HI> manner, it must be at <HI>this</HI> Time: whence it will follow (contrary to his darling Principle) That the Power of <HI>Ordination</HI> is not the <HI>peculiar</HI> Privilege of an Officer <HI>superior</HI> to Presbyters or ordinary Teachers; but that Teachers may ordain Teachers, yea Bishops and Apostles too. Or else 2. He must own <HI>Barnabas</HI>'s Call to be <HI>immediate</HI> &amp; not in the <HI>ordinary</HI> manner: so consequently the Instance not at all to his purpose. — The <HI>matter of Fact,</HI> which our <HI>Author</HI> brought these Instances to prove, was, That the APOSTLES <HI>themselves conferred Apostolical Power on others.</HI> But I be∣lieve every unbyass'd Reader will be of opinion, that all his Instances are impertinent, and will vote the <HI>Gentleman</HI> wholly
<PB N="45" REF="002594_0048_0FDB7E465647B470"/>
beside his Cushion.—And now having thus sap't the Foun∣dation, hence the Argument he builds upon it in favor of his beloved Prelacy, by natural Consequence falls to the Ground, and turns to nothing.</P>
<P>BUT moreover, to enforce what he had said relating to these Apostles, our <HI>Author</HI> proceeds to instance in some <HI>others,</HI> who were <HI>raised from among the ordinary Pastors, to the</HI> Apostolical <HI>or</HI> Episcopal <HI>Order; and endu'd with Authority over Churches and their Pastors.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 47. HE instances in <HI>Timothy,</HI> and endeavours to prove, <HI>That He was Bishop of the Church of</HI> Ephesus.— But how does he prove it? Why, because he had committed to him the se∣veral <HI>Powers of Ordination &amp; Jurisdiction.</HI> But this is of little weight; unless he can further prove, that <HI>Timothy</HI> had a PAR∣TICULAR and fixed RELATION to that Church; at least that he had the SOLE Power in himself; that he was com∣mission'd to ordain &amp; govern ALONE, and the <HI>Presbyters</HI> there absolutely excluded: Since otherwise, by the same Rule, and way of Reasoning, we may as well conclude that <HI>Timothy</HI> was to be <HI>sole</HI> TEACHER at <HI>Ephesus,</HI> and none to <HI>preach</HI> but he; because he is exhorted to <HI>give himself to Reading, to Exhortation &amp; Doctrine; to preach the Word, to he instant in season, out of season.</HI> 'Tis not enough to say, <HI>Timothy</HI> had these &amp; those Powers, and was to do this and t'other Thing: but it must be prov'd that the <HI>Elders of Ephesus</HI> had not the same Powers, and cou'd not do the same Things, (even tho' they had the same Qua∣lifications) that they might not <HI>lay on Hands,</HI> might not <HI>reprove one another,</HI> as there was occasion, and the like. And then, It must be proved that <HI>Timothy</HI> had those Powers, and exercised them, in the Capacity of a <HI>Bishop;</HI> not as one having <HI>extraordi∣nary</HI> Authority, and by virtue of extraordinary Gifts; much less as being an <HI>Elder:</HI> and that he had not the <HI>Assistence</HI> of the other Elders.— Particularly it must be proved, That he had the <HI>sole</HI> Power of <HI>Ordination,</HI> and acted <HI>singly</HI> herein, if ever the Prelatists wou'd gain their point. But now how improbable is this? Seeing all the <HI>Ordinations</HI> we read of were performed by a <HI>Plurality</HI> of Ordainers: and especially seeing, if <HI>Paul</HI> was concern'd in the Ordination of <HI>Timothy,</HI> he took the hands of the <HI>Presbytery</HI> with his own: for we cannot suppose but that <HI>Timothy</HI> wou'd follow the Pattern of <HI>his own</HI> Ordination, and not assume more Power than the <HI>A∣postle</HI> himself claimed.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="002594_0049_0FDB7E47B5F585B8"/>MOREOVER, It is observable, by the same way of Reason∣ing that our <HI>Author</HI> makes use of here, to prove <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Episcopacy, the <HI>Papists</HI> do infer <HI>Peter</HI>'s Supremacy from other places of Scripture (as <HI>Mat.</HI> 16.19 <HI>Joh.</HI> 21.15.) Where <HI>CHRIST</HI> gave Instructions, Charges and Powers to the <HI>A∣postles;</HI> using the <HI>singular</HI> number, and directing his Speech to <HI>Peter</HI> in <HI>particular,</HI> even when the <HI>other</HI> Apostles were by. And indeed, I think, if the mere Form of Expression is any thing to be built upon, the <HI>Papists</HI> may as well pretend, that what <HI>CHRIST</HI> here said to <HI>Peter,</HI> was <HI>personal</HI> and peculiar to him, as the <HI>Prelatists</HI> appropriate to <HI>Timothy</HI> what <HI>Paul</HI> says in his Epistles to him about Government &amp; Ordination. For perhaps <HI>Timothy</HI> might differ little more (if any thing) from the Rest of the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> than <HI>Peter</HI> did from the Rest of the <HI>Apostles.</HI> Now the Apostles acted among themselves in a con∣stant <HI>Parity;</HI> notwithstanding the seeming <HI>peculiar</HI> Powers given to <HI>Peter.</HI> And the Case at <HI>Ephesus</HI> might be the very same.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, I wou'd observe; If what our <HI>Author</HI> affirms be true, that <HI>Timothy</HI> had a Power over the <HI>Presbyters</HI> of the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> it is a Truth, that will rather <HI>hurt</HI> than help his Cause. For it is a plain Case, that the <HI>Presbyters</HI> of the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> were of the <HI>Episcopal Order.</HI> These are they to whom the Apostle said, Act 20.28. <HI>The Holy Ghost hath made you</HI> Bishops, or, (as in our Translation) <HI>Overseers.</HI> And in the 1st Epist. to <HI>Timothy,</HI> 3d Chap. <HI>Paul</HI> very evidently ascribes to these Elders <HI>the power of Government.</HI> They were to be <HI>such as ruled well their own Houses, having their Children in subjection with all Gravity,</HI>— for this remarkable Reason, because <HI>if a Man know not bow to rule his own House, how shall he take Care of the Church of GOD?</HI> Which passage, the learned Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> (whose <HI>Authority</HI> perhaps may go as far with some, as our <HI>Author</HI> supposes Mr. <HI>Calvin</HI>'s will with others) para∣phrases thus; <Q>For sure he that cannot rule so much a less Province, will be unfit to be made a <HI>Governour</HI> of the Church of GOD.</Q> Now the <HI>Episcoparians</HI> agree with the <HI>Presbyte∣rians,</HI> that the Powers of <HI>Government</HI> &amp; <HI>Ordination</HI> go together. Since therefore these Presbyters had the <HI>Former,</HI> they must of necessity have had the <HI>Latter</HI> also. Hence if <HI>Timothy</HI> had a Power over these <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as our <HI>Author</HI> affirms, he must be forced to grant one of these three Things, (neither of which will please him nor serve his Cause) <HI>Viz. Either,</HI></P>
<P N="1"><PB N="47" REF="002594_0050_0FDB7E4941761D70"/>(1.) THAT that Power in <HI>Timothy</HI> was only <HI>temporary</HI> &amp; <HI>extraordinary;</HI> and he (so far) an extraordinary Officer, as the <HI>Presbyterians</HI> generally say he was.— <HI>Or,</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) THAT there is an <HI>ordinary</HI> Officer in the Church <HI>Juperior</HI> to <HI>Bishops;</HI> since the <HI>Episcoparians</HI> reckon all that have the powers of <HI>Government</HI> and <HI>Ordination</HI> to be Bishops. For which Reason, Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> puts that Construction upon 2 Tim. 2.2. <HI>Appoint them as Bishops in the several Churches</HI> UNDER THEE.— Or else,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) HE must allow such Officers, as he thinks <HI>inferior to Bishops,</HI> to have the Powers of <HI>Government</HI> &amp; <HI>Ordination;</HI> which is one of the main Things <HI>Presbyterians</HI> contend for.</P>
<P>BUT now in the last place, I wou'd observe; Our <HI>Author</HI> makes some <HI>Acknowlegements</HI> elsewhere that evidently subvert the Doctrine of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Episcopacy. <HI>Pag.</HI> 25. He confesses <HI>Paul</HI>'s Jurisdiction over <HI>Timothy,</HI> when he mentions what <HI>Paul</HI> said of him, That <HI>He served with him, as a</HI> Son <HI>with his</HI> Father, <HI>in the work of the Gospel;</HI> being <HI>obsequious to Apostolical Orders; going whither</HI> he <HI>was sent, and coming when called,</HI> &amp;c. And else∣where our <HI>Author</HI> observes, That the <HI>Apostles</HI> had <HI>Jurisdiction over all Churches;</HI> whence it follows that <HI>Timothy</HI> an Officer in the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> must be in some Subjection to <HI>Paul.</HI> And if he was subject or subordinate to another, then certainly he cou'd not be a <HI>Diocesan Bishop;</HI> since such a Bishop must have a <HI>Fulness of Power</HI> in his particular Province, and be exempt from the Jurisdiction of any Ecclesiastical Superiors: Much less cou'd he have <HI>Apostolic Power,</HI> as our <HI>Author</HI> pretends; because (as he justly observes, <HI>pag.</HI> 17) <HI>All Apostles by their Commission had equal Power, and there was no Superiority of one Apostle to another.</HI></P>
<P>IN a word, If (after all) this Gentleman will maintain that <HI>Timothy</HI> had and exercised <HI>Episcopal Power</HI> over the Pres∣byters of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> (tho' he dare not venture to say, <HI>under what Designation,</HI> as his Phrase is) then he must necessarily grant one of these Things — <HI>Either,</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) THAT <HI>Timothy</HI> had an <HI>absolute independent</HI> Power, and was not under the <HI>Apostles</HI> Jurisdiction.— <HI>Or,</HI></P>
<P N="2">(2.) THAT the Power, which the <HI>Apostle</HI> exercised over him, was <HI>extraordinary;</HI> and so the Apostles only <HI>temporary</HI> Officers.— <HI>Or,</HI></P>
<P N="3">(3.) THAT the <HI>Apostolical</HI> Power was not properly and simply <HI>Episcopal,</HI> but of a different Kind: and so the Apostles an Order <HI>distinct</HI> from Bishops.— <HI>Or else,</HI></P>
<P N="4"><PB N="48" REF="002594_0051_0FDB7E4ACF4E1F10"/>(4.) THAT <HI>all</HI> Bishops have not by Divine Right an <HI>Equality</HI> of Power, but may be in Subordination to one ano∣ther.</P>
<P>LET him chuse which he will of these <HI>Postulata,</HI> he must needs commit <HI>violence</HI> upon one part or other of his Scheme; and what he has built up with one hand, pull down with his other.</P>
<P>I know not of any way now left our <HI>Author</HI> to take in de∣fense of his Doctrine, but to say, That <HI>Timothy was the Apostle's</HI> Substitute, <HI>or Delegate; not acting properly in his</HI> own, <HI>but in</HI> Paul's <HI>Name, governed by Apostolical Instructions and executing Apostolical Orders.</HI>— And indeed, if we compare what our <HI>Author</HI> says of <HI>Timothy</HI> in his 25th <HI>pag.</HI> with what he says in his 49th <HI>pag.</HI> he will appear to be of <HI>this Opinion.</HI>—But neither will this help his Argument at all. No Plea can be gather'd from it, for Bishops being Successors of the Apostles, though we suppose the Delegation to <HI>Timothy</HI> to be matter of Fact: because it can't be prov'd, but that <HI>Timothy</HI> was an <HI>itinerant</HI> Missionary, having no particular Relation to the Church of <HI>Ephesus:</HI> because it can't be proved, but that the supposed <HI>Trust</HI> committed to him was a <HI>temporary</HI> and transient Assigna∣tion; one of those <HI>extraordinary Expedients,</HI> which the peculiar Occasions &amp; Necessities of that Day called for; having a <HI>particular Respect to the first planting of the Gospel, and the erecting and setling the Christian Church in the world:</HI> the Powers relating to which our <HI>Author</HI> himself, (<HI>pag.</HI> 33.) owns were <HI>temporary</HI> and <HI>extraordinary.</HI>— Furthermore, As I have had occasion once and again to observe, He confesses that the Apostles <HI>Jurisdiction over all Churches</HI> was but temporary, and needful only for the primitive Times; and if so, I can't see how a <HI>limitted</HI> Jurisdiction of that nature should be necessary in after-times. If <HI>Paul</HI>'s Jurisdiction over <HI>all Churches</HI> was extraordi∣nary, then it seems to me that the Jurisdiction he is said to exercise over the Church &amp; Pastors of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> in particular, by the mediation of <HI>Timothy</HI> (which was specifically the same with that) must be likewise extraordinary <HI>Timothy</HI>'s pretended E∣piscopacy cou'd be no other than the Exercise of Apostolical universal Jurisdiction, under a particular Application: and this particular Trust must cease together with the extraordi∣nary Power that was the Foundation &amp; Source of it.— Moreover, It is not unworthy of Consideration, That in the exercise of this supposed Episcopal Government, <HI>Timothy</HI> had an <HI>inspired Apostle</HI> to direct him: And now will any imagin
<PB N="49" REF="002594_0052_0FDB7E5037141900"/>
that the <HI>Bishops, Timothy</HI>'s pretended Successors, do not want some <HI>Higher Authority</HI> to supervise them, as well? Or are <HI>Presbyters</HI> the only Persons that need to be under the Conduct and Regulation of Superiors! Methinks, our <HI>Timothies</HI> as much need a <HI>Paul</HI> to inspect them, as the <HI>Presbyters</HI> want a <HI>Timothy</HI> to govern them. And since there's no more any <HI>Paul</HI> with his extraordinary Powers, we may safely conclude that <HI>Timothy</HI> his supposed <HI>Delegate,</HI> has long ago taken his final Leave of the World.</P>
<P>BUT now to proceed with our <HI>Author.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 48. HE instanceth in <HI>Titus,</HI> and says, That <HI>the like Power &amp; Authority</HI> (with that of <HI>Timothy) was conferred on him, over the Churches in Crete.</HI> But here the like Difficulties arise too: and if the Case of Both was the same, the same Answer may serve for both.— I shall only observe, that <HI>the Elders</HI> to <HI>be ordained by</HI> Titus <HI>in every City,</HI> were to be blameless as the <HI>Stewards of God,</HI> that is (saith Dr. <HI>Hammond)</HI> as <HI>those that had the</HI> Government <HI>of GOD's Family intrusted to them.</HI> Now since the <HI>Elders</HI> or Presbyters, were to have the power of <HI>Govern∣ment,</HI> they were to have that of <HI>Ordination</HI> likewise; and so were to be <HI>Bishops,</HI> according to the opinion of the Episcopa∣rians. Hence if our <HI>Author</HI> assert <HI>Titus</HI>'s Episcopal Power over them, He will entangle himself in all the inextricable Diffi∣culties, which I have cast in his way, under the former head.</P>
<P>THUS you see the two Instances of <HI>Timothy</HI> &amp; <HI>Titus,</HI> which our <HI>Author</HI> thought wou'd afford convincing Arguments for a settled <HI>Prelacy</HI> in the Church, do conclude nothing at all in favour of it. It was therefore ingenuously done of Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> to desert his Brethren, by making those Concessions, which we find in the <HI>Preface</HI> to his Commentary upon <HI>Titus.</HI> "As to the great Controversy (saith he) whether <HI>Timothy</HI> &amp; <HI>Titus</HI> were indeed made <HI>Bishops,</HI> the one of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> the other of <HI>Crete;</HI> I confess I can find nothing of this matter in any Writer of the <HI>first three</HI> Centuries, nor any Intimation that they bore that Name —. (He adds afterwards) I confess, that these two Instances, absolutely taken, afford us no con∣vincing Arguments for a settled <HI>Diocesan Episcopacy.</HI>"</P>
<P>I come now to our <HI>Author</HI>'s last Instance, viz. <HI>The</HI> Angels <HI>of the seven Churches of Asia, which</HI> (he tells us) <HI>were Persons of the</HI> Apostolical <HI>&amp;</HI> Episcopal <HI>Order.</HI> But his Argument here,
<PB N="50" REF="002594_0053_0FDB7E5237269378"/>
is as weak and unconcluding as any of the Former. For there is no Evidence at all, nor any Shadow of Reason to sup∣pose, that those <HI>Angels</HI> were <HI>Diocesan Bishops,</HI> or such as had Authority over Presbyters. There is nothing in the Word <HI>Angel,</HI> that will yield any Demonstration of it. Whether you consider the Etymology of the <HI>Name,</HI> or the Style of the <HI>Apoca∣lypse,</HI> there's nothing to forbid our taking it in a <HI>Collective</HI> Sense, for the Body of the <HI>Clergy</HI> or <HI>Presbyters.</HI> And if we look into the <HI>Epistles</HI> to those Churches, we shall find many Expressions that favour this Construction: but not a word (that I can see) countenancing the Episcopal Opinion. Nay, if we shou'd allow every Angel to be a <HI>single</HI> Person; the ut∣most you can suppose him to be, is a <HI>Senior Pastor</HI> in a Church; or the <HI>Moderator</HI> of a Presbytery, approved by some who are in their Judgment &amp; Practice very Anti-prelatical. There is not the least Hint given, as if these <HI>Angels</HI> had Jurisdiction over any inferior Ministers; much less the <HI>sole</HI> power of Govern∣ment, and a <HI>Negative</HI> upon Pastors and Churches: without which Things, there can be no rational Inference (from those Angels) in favour of <HI>Diocesan Bishops.</HI> 'Tis indeed one of the most <HI>noisy</HI> &amp; blustering Arguments made use of on the Episcopal side, but perhaps equally <HI>shallow,</HI> and senseless.</P>
<P>THUS I have faithfully examin'd all the <HI>Instances,</HI> our <HI>Au∣thor</HI> has thought fit to mention, for the proof of his Point, <HI>That the Apostolic Power over</HI> Pastors <HI>is continu'd in the Church, in the hands of</HI> Bishops. And I am apt to flatter my self, that I have <HI>disarm'd</HI> him of all his supposed <HI>Precedents,</HI> have <HI>beaten him off from his strong Holds,</HI> and turn'd most of his <HI>own</HI> Weapons upon himself.</P>
<P>NOW it remains to consider the <HI>Replies</HI> he has made to the Scripture-Proofs, which <HI>Presbyterians</HI> bring: but before I pass to that, let me look back a little, and consider an incidental Passage or two of our <HI>Author</HI>'s, under the former head.</P>
<P>AT the bottom of <HI>pag.</HI> 48. (speaking of <HI>Timothy</HI> &amp; <HI>Titus</HI>) he says, <HI>I will not contend but that in the</HI> EXERCISE OF THIS POWER, <HI>they might have taken the Advice &amp;</HI> CONCUR∣RENCE <HI>of the faithful Pastors in these Churches, &amp; concerted Af∣fairs with them: and not done things in an arbitrary &amp; despotic manner.</HI> To this I cannot answer better than in the words of Mr. <HI>Pierce</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vind. part. <HI>3.</HI> ch. <HI>1.</HI> pa. <HI>39.</HI></NOTE>. <Q>As to our part, we do not condemn all manner
<PB N="51" REF="002594_0054_0FDB7E53CBB3ED08"/>
of precedence or pre-eminence. If the Episcoparians had only asserted it to be both lawful &amp; useful, that among Presbyters who are, by the first Institution, all equal, there should be one for Order's sake, placed above the rest, and called the Bishop; we should not upon that account have contended with them, or separated from them. Who knows not that the foreign Churches, that are under Presbyterian Government, have, in their Synods &amp; Classes, <HI>Moderators, Prolocutors,</HI> &amp;c which are by Experience found necessary? And if men had been entrusted with those Offices in our Churches, not barely upon occasion, but <HI>for life,</HI> or <HI>as long as they behav'd themselves well in them,</HI> I hardly think any Quarrel would have risen upon this head. Nay, so earnestly did our Ministers desire Peace, that if our Bishops had been obliged to govern their Churches, with the Consent and Assistance of their Presbyters, they would have born with it, rather than have been deprived of the <HI>Publick ex∣ercise</HI> of their <HI>Ministry.</HI> For they thus considered with them∣selves; that it was enough for them, if they preserved entire the power they received from GOD, and left the Consecration whereby the Presbyters are made Bishops, as a useless thing, to those who were satisfied with the Law∣fulness &amp; Expediency of it. This then is our Judgment, that the distinction our Adversaries make between Presbyter and Bishop is groundless, being no where made in the Scripture; and that CHRIST is alone a Monarch in His Church; and that He hath never appointed a Monarchical Form of Government to be practised in it;</Q> since we no where find any such thing taught, either by <HI>CHRIST himself,</HI> or by his <HI>holy Apostles, to whom he gave special Commission and Power to plant, and settle, and govern his Church, in his name. Con∣cerning whom therefore,</HI> (to borrow our <HI>Author</HI>'s words, <HI>pag.</HI> 50, 51.) <HI>we cannot entertain the least doubt in our minds but that they would be most faithful &amp; exact, in settling that Order, and Instituting those Officers in all fully constituted Churches, which their Lord had appointed; and would be careful to leave the Church, at their Death under the same Order &amp; Government, furnished with the same Offi∣ces &amp; Ministers, which CHRIST himself her Lord, had instituted &amp; appointed for her Edification.</HI></P>
<P>AND now, since our <HI>Author</HI> is fully persuaded as well as I, that the <HI>Apostles</HI> were faithful, exact, and careful in model∣ling the Church according to <HI>Christ</HI>'s own appointment; I can't see, that it would have been any great <HI>Confirmation</HI> of

his Cause, if he had brought forth the <HI>Records of the Ancient Church,</HI> and <HI>Catalogues</HI> of its <HI>Bishops,</HI> which he speaks of, <HI>pa.</HI> 51. [Nay, altho' the Bishops may be there (<HI>as</HI> pa. 43. <HI>he tells us they are</HI>) frequently called <HI>Apostles;</HI> and again, the Apostles stiled <HI>Bishops;</HI> nay, further, altho' he cou'd make it appear, as evident, as himself supposes it is, that many of the <HI>Ancients</HI> were of opinion, <HI>That in the Apostles was instituted the Episcopal Office, and that in the Bishops the Apostolic Office was continu'd;</HI> This (neither) cou'd not serve him much.] For if they speak <HI>not</HI> according to the <HI>Institution of Christ,</HI> and his <HI>Apostles,</HI> we may safely venture to say, That so far as they are <HI>inconsistent</HI> with it, <HI>there is no light in them.</HI> Whereas, on the other hand, if we find them <HI>conformable</HI> to it, however they may deserve Com∣mendation, yet they will add no weight or force at all to our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s or his <HI>Apostles</HI> Institution.—Much might be said to this matter, but since our <HI>Author</HI> only gives a transient <HI>Hint</HI> upon it, and seems presently to retract it, by ingenuously confes∣sing he has taken a step out of the Line he had set himself, I shall add nothing further in Reply to it, but the following Passages from a Learned <HI>Dissenter.</HI> "We deny not (saith he) that many of the Fathers seem to make a great difference betwixt <HI>Bishops</HI> &amp; <HI>Presbyters:</HI> but this doth not overthrow out Hypothesis. For if they are the same in <HI>Scripture,</HI> the sayings of the <HI>Fathers</HI> cannot make them otherwise: and yet (he adds) few or none of the Ancients say they are <HI>distinct Orders;</HI> much less that they are so by. <HI>Divine Right:</HI> but some of them acknowlege the contrary It is not therefore their using the name of <HI>Bishop</HI> in a sense <HI>distinct</HI> from that of Presbyter, no, nor requiring Presbyters to be <HI>obedient</HI> to their Bishop, that will prove a Superiority of Order <HI>Jure Divino;</HI> for we grant that it was the early Practice of the Church to choose one of the <HI>gravest</HI> &amp; wisest of the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> and constitute him a sort of <HI>President</HI> over the Rest; and that where there were <HI>many</HI> Presbyters in a particular Church, commonly the <HI>Eldest</HI> or <HI>Worthiest</HI> was as <HI>Pastor,</HI> and the other his Assistants: but still we know, thas the <HI>Parson</HI> of a Parish and the <HI>Curates</HI> are of the same Order; and every Bishop in <HI>England</HI> is equal in <HI>Order</HI> to the Arch-Bishop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> altho' they take an oath of <HI>Canonical Obedience</HI> to him.

<P>THE first text mentioned is in <HI>Act.</HI> 20. where the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> having <HI>sent from Miletus to Ephesus,</HI> ver. 17. <HI>and called the Elders of the Church,</HI> so charges them, ver. 28. <HI>Take heed therefore unto your selves, and unto all the Flock over which the Holy Ghost hath made you</HI> OVERSEERS (or, <HI>Bishops,</HI> as the same word is else∣where translated) <HI>to feed the Church of God,</HI> &amp;c.—Here it is as plain as any thing can be, that the <HI>same</HI> persons who are cal∣led <HI>Elders</HI> or <HI>Presbyters</HI> ver. 17. are called also <HI>Bishops</HI> ver. 28 and were <HI>such Officers</HI> as there were <HI>more than one of in a Church;</HI> and therefore could not be <HI>Bishops properly so called</HI> in our <HI>Au∣thor</HI>'s sense. To this our <HI>Author</HI> answers that <HI>They say</HI> (it must be only by guess; for there is no foundation for it in the Text) <HI>that the Apostle called both Bishops &amp; Presbyters unto him. and that the Clergy of all the Cities thereabout were there; so that what he says,</HI> ver. 28. <HI>was principally directed to the</HI> Bishops, <HI>and by way of reflection to the</HI> Presbyters. If we should grant this were true, yet still their <HI>Names</HI> are used <HI>promiscuously.</HI> But it is so far from being true, that it is directly contrary both to the letter of the text and the circumstances of the Apostle.</P>
<P>For,</P>
<P N="1">1. IF the Clergy of all the neighbouring Cities had been there, the Apostle (we may conclude) would have said <HI>Flocks</HI> and Churches, and not <HI>Flock</HI> and Church. And</P>
<P N="2">2. THE Apostle was now <HI>hastening, if possible, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost,</HI> ver. 16. and therefore would not call at <HI>Ephesus</HI> himself, lest he should be detained too long; but sent for the <HI>Elders</HI> of the Church to come to him at <HI>Miletus:</HI> which makes it the most unlikely thing in the world, that he would tarry there till the Clergy of <HI>all</HI> the Cities about <HI>Ephesus</HI> could be called together. So that it ap∣pears plainly both from the manner of the Apostle's Expres∣sion, and from the great haste he was then in, that none but the <HI>Elders</HI> of the Church of <HI>Ephesus</HI> were there present; whom the Apostle calls <HI>Bishops of the Holy Ghost's making.</HI> To all this our <HI>Author</HI> hath nothing to oppose, but a mere Guess, which
<PB N="55" REF="002594_0058_0FDB7E5CB7A45E98"/>
he seems not willing to take the Credit of to himself; and which if allowed, won't serve the turn he uses it for. Before I dismiss this Text, I would observe further, that the Apostle charges these <HI>Elders</HI> to <HI>feed the Church.</HI> &amp;c. Now <HI>feeding</HI> being a metaphor taken from the business of a <HI>Shepherd,</HI> implies go∣vernment as well as instruction. So that from this Text it appears,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT <HI>the same Persons were called</HI> ELDERS <HI>&amp;</HI> BISHOPS.</P>
<P>And</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT <HI>in one Church there were several</HI> ELDERS <HI>all</HI> ALIKE <HI>concerned in the Government of it;</HI> And therefore ac∣cording to the Episcoparian Scheme, invested with the power of <HI>Ordination</HI> also, &amp; all other Powers that belong to the highest Office in the Church. So that this Text proves an <HI>Identity</HI> of <HI>Office</HI> as well as <HI>name:</HI> To which I will add,</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT in all probability this charge was given to <HI>those Elders,</HI> in the presence of <HI>Timothy,</HI> who appears from <HI>ver.</HI> 4. to have been one of the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s attendants in this Voyage. And if so, had the <HI>Apostle</HI> been of our <HI>Author</HI>'s opinion, that he was the Bishop of that Church, it is very strange he should take no notice at all of <HI>him,</HI> as concerned with it; nor give any charge to the Presbyters to pay due respect unto their <HI>Bishop</HI> (whose <HI>Youth</HI> might tempt them to <HI>despise him)</HI> as well as <HI>to take heed to all the Flock.</HI></P>
<P>THE next Passage mentioned is that in <HI>Titus,</HI> Chap 1. where after the Apostle hath laid down some of the qualifi∣cations of the <HI>Elders whom he left Titus to ordain in every City,</HI> he gives this reason <HI>ver.</HI> 7. for insisting on those qualifications: <HI>For a</HI> Bishop <HI>must be blameless as the Steward of God,</HI> &amp;c. which wou'd be no reason at all, unless the Apostle intended the <HI>same Officer</HI> by the Bishop in the 7th <HI>ver.</HI> which he did by the <HI>Elders</HI> before. To this, I can't find that our <HI>Author</HI> says any thing, which hath so much as the least tendency to take off the force of it. But he says one thing to perplex himself and his Cause, viz. <HI>That there were Presbyters before at</HI> Crete, <HI>and</HI> Ti∣tus <HI>was to ordain some of them Bishops;</HI> whereas he had said before <HI>pa</HI> 48. <HI>That an Episcopal Power &amp; Authority was con∣ferred on</HI> Titus <HI>over the Churches in</HI> Crete. From which two passages laid together one would think, that <HI>Titus</HI> was to ordain <HI>Bishops,</HI> in some of the Cities in <HI>Crete, inferiour</HI> to him∣self; whereas the Scheme of our <HI>Author</HI> and his Brethren is, <HI>That there is no superiority or power of one Bishop over another.</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="002594_0059_0FDB7E5F029938E0"/>
Besides, as Critics observe, the original word here rendred to <HI>ordain,</HI> will not bear such a sense: it signifies plainly to <HI>con∣stitute</HI> &amp; <HI>appoint.</HI> And so here it must needs mean the <HI>Ordi∣nation</HI> of persons to the <HI>office</HI> of <HI>Presbyters;</HI> and not the <HI>advance∣ment</HI> of <HI>Presbyters</HI> to be <HI>Bishops. Presbyter</HI> or <HI>Elder</HI> here is the <HI>Capacity, to which</HI> persons were to be <HI>ordained;</HI> and not <HI>from which</HI> they were to be <HI>promoted.</HI></P>
<P>IN the next place he tells us that 1 Tim. 3.2,—7. <HI>is to be understood of Bishops properly so called, that were to be ordained to preside over other Cities, as Timothy did over Ephesus.</HI> But this won't serve his turn; for <HI>Timothy</HI> was <HI>to abide at Ephesus,</HI> ch 1. ver. 3. and not to travel from City to City to <HI>ordain Bishops.</HI> Besides, if the Apostle had known any middle sort of Officer, called a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> between the <HI>Bishop</HI> here mentioned, and the <HI>Deacon</HI> described afterwards, in the same Chapter, it is very strange he should give <HI>no character</HI> of <HI>him,</HI> when he is so carefully instructing <HI>Timothy, how to behave himself in the House of God,</HI> that he might know what manner of person to put into this Office also, if there should be occasion for it. And therefore we cannot but conclude, that a <HI>Bishop</HI> and a <HI>Presbyter</HI> were the same thing in the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s account, and that he knew no other <HI>ordinary Officers</HI> in the Church, but <HI>Bishops</HI> or <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> and <HI>Deacons.</HI></P>
<P>THE last Text he mentions is Phil. 1.1. <HI>Paul &amp; Timothy the Servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus, which are at Philippi, with the Bishops &amp; Deacons.</HI> From this text we gather that the <HI>Government</HI> of the Church at <HI>Philippi</HI> was not lodged in the hands of a <HI>single Person,</HI> or a <HI>Bishop, properly so called,</HI> in our <HI>Author</HI>'s sense; but in the hands of a <HI>plurality</HI> or <HI>Presbytery;</HI> and that there was no <HI>middle Order</HI> in the Church of <HI>Philippi,</HI> between the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> here mentioned.</P>
<P>TO this our <HI>Author</HI> answers, first. <HI>That these words may be understood of the Bishops of</HI> Philippi, <HI>and other neighbouring Cities, who were wont to convene and meet together.</HI></P>
<P>MY reply is, 1. That this Epistle is written to a <HI>Church;</HI> that therefore when it says <HI>to the saints which are at</HI> Philippi, it is to be understood of the Saints that dwelt there and con∣stituted that Church. And in like manner ought the <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Deacons</HI> to be understood of those that did belong to <HI>that</HI> Church; unless there were some apparent reason to the contrary.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="57" REF="002594_0060_0FDB7E60BAD82DB0"/>2. THAT there is no Intimation in this Epistle, that it was to be delivered to an <HI>Assembly of Bishops</HI> convened at <HI>Phi∣lippi;</HI> that therefore there is no Ground for such a Supposi∣tion, but it is a <HI>mere Guess</HI> to serve a Cause that needs such Helps.</P>
<P N="3">3. THAT it is a <HI>Guess</HI> not only without Foundation, but against the express words of the Epistle it self. For the A∣postle calls those whom he wrote it to, <HI>Philippians.</HI> Chap. 4.15. <HI>Ye Philippians know also,</HI> &amp;c. Now it would be very absurd to call an <HI>Assembly of Bishops,</HI> met together from the neighbouring Cities, <HI>Philippians,</HI> only because they happened to hold a meeting at <HI>Philippi.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4 OUR <HI>Author</HI>'s Guess cannot be right, nor yet the Hypo∣thesis which it is designed to serve, because the Apostle takes no notice of any <HI>middle Order</HI> in his <HI>Salutations.</HI> For had there at that day been <HI>three Orders of Officers</HI> in the Church, and had there been such a convention of <HI>Bishops</HI> of the neighbouring Cities at <HI>Philippi,</HI> it can't be supposed, that the Deacons who are the <HI>lowest Order</HI> would have been present, and the <HI>Presbyters</HI> who are <HI>superior</HI> to them, not so. And if the Presbyters had been present, certainly the Apostle would not have <HI>saluted</HI> their <HI>Inferiors,</HI> without taking any notice at all of <HI>them.</HI></P>
<P>WELL, If a bad <HI>Guess</HI> won't destroy the Argument foun∣ded on this Text, perhaps a forced Construction may do the business better; for our <HI>Author</HI> says, secondly, <HI>That this Text may mean that</HI> Paul, <HI>and the</HI> Bishops <HI>&amp;</HI> Deacons <HI>that were with him, salute the saints that are at</HI> Philippi. As if it had run thus. <HI>Paul &amp; Timothy the servants of Jesus Christ, with the Bishops and Deacons, to all the saints in Christ Jesus, which are at Philippi.</HI></P>
<P>I readily agree with our <HI>Author,</HI> that this Answer is <HI>not obvious to every one.</HI> For it is a wonder to me, that <HI>any man,</HI> that hath re'd the two Epistles of the same Apostle to the <HI>Corin∣thians,</HI> should ever make it. In both those Epistles, the <HI>form of Expression</HI> used in the <HI>Salutation,</HI> is exactly Parallel both in the <HI>Original,</HI> and in <HI>our Translation,</HI> to the <HI>form of Expression</HI> used here. And yet I believe the greatest Zealot for our <HI>Author</HI>'s cause (when he is not out of temper) will hardly be able to perswade himself, that the <HI>Salutation,</HI> in the <HI>first</HI> of those E∣pistles, ought to run thus; <HI>Paul an Apostle of Jesus Christ, thro' the will of God, and Sosthenes our Brother, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord both theirs and ours, unto the Church of God which is at Corinth,</HI> &amp;c. Or that the <HI>true Construction</HI> of the <HI>Salutation</HI> in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Epistle is, <HI>Paul
<PB N="58" REF="002594_0061_0FDB7E64EB1A58F8"/>
an Apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our bro∣ther, with all the saints that are in all A<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>haia; unto the Church of God which is at Corinth,</HI> &amp;c. I think, I need not mention the reasons why I suppose no Body will be ambitious of the Credit of finding out such a new way of reading the two last mentioned Salutations. And why the <HI>order</HI> of the <HI>Salu∣tation</HI> in the Epistle to the <HI>Philippians</HI> should be so <HI>inverted,</HI> as it is manifest, the <HI>same form of Expression</HI> ought not to be, in any other place, where it is used by the <HI>same Apostle</HI> I believe no reason can be given, but such an one, as it will be tho't prudence not to expose.</P>
<P>OUR <HI>Author</HI> hath now done with the Texts of Scripture, from which, he says, <HI>we allege that the Names of Bishop &amp; Pres∣byter are used promiscuously.</HI> And upon the whole concludes, that if he should <HI>grant an Identity of names, yet it will not follow, that there was an Identity of</HI> Offices; <HI>because names are common in Scripture, where Offices are acknowleged to be distinct.</HI> But he should have remembred, that <HI>something more</HI> than a bare <HI>Iden∣tity of Names</HI> is argued from diverse of these Texts. And since he hath been no better able to prove, <HI>that in all these places we are to understand Bishops properly so called, and not Presbyters;</HI> he might have tho't it worth his while, to have endeavoured an answer to what we argue from the Texts, besides a <HI>promiscu∣ous use of Names.</HI> For from <HI>Acts</HI> 20 27, 28. we not only prove, that the names of <HI>Bishop</HI> &amp; <HI>Presbyter</HI> are used promiscuously; but also that the <HI>Government</HI> of the Church at <HI>Ephesus</HI> was committed to a <HI>Plurality,</HI> and not to a <HI>single Person;</HI> and that therefore all these <HI>Presbyters</HI> had a power of <HI>Ordination</HI> also; (since the Powers of Government and Ordination go together, our Adversaries themselves being Judges) from whence it follows that <HI>Presbyters</HI> properly so called have a Right by <HI>Scripture</HI> to all those <HI>Powers,</HI> which <HI>Bishops</HI> now claim as pecu∣liar to themselves.</P>
<P>AGAIN; From 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 3.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 3.4. &amp;c. We argue that the Apostle knew of but <HI>two Orders of Officers</HI> in the Church. For it would be <HI>very strange,</HI> when he is so sollicitous, that <HI>Timothy might know how he ought to behave himself in the House of God;</HI> that yet he should not give him any account of the <HI>Qualifica∣tions</HI> necessary for <HI>one Order of Officers</HI> that belonged to it. And it would be <HI>much stranger still,</HI> that he should be so <HI>very particular,</HI> in setting down the <HI>Qualifications</HI> of one sit for the <HI>Office</HI> of a <HI>Deacon,</HI> which is on all hands, allowed to be the <HI>lowest Order</HI> and yet <HI>omit</HI> all mention of an <HI>Officer</HI> of <HI>higher Degree and more importance.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="002594_0062_0FDB7E661130F488"/>SO again, (to mention no more,) we say, it appears from <HI>Phil.</HI> 1.1. that there were but but <HI>two orders of Officers</HI> in <HI>that Church.</HI> For it would be no way consistent with the <HI>De∣cency</HI> observed on all occasions by the <HI>Apostle,</HI> to have saluted the <HI>Deacons</HI> by name, and to have taken <HI>no notice</HI> at all of one of the <HI>Orders superior to them,</HI> if there had been <HI>more than one</HI> that were so. And we say moreover, that it farther appears from this Text, that the <HI>highest Order</HI> here mentioned was <HI>such</HI> as there might be <HI>more than one of,</HI> at the same time, in the same Church; and that therefore they could <HI>not</HI> be <HI>Bishops,</HI> in the sense of our Adversaries; for of them there can be <HI>but one</HI> in a Church at once.</P>
<P>THESE things lie <HI>plain</HI> &amp; <HI>obvious</HI> to every Eye in these Texts, and are much more than a <HI>bare Identity</HI> of <HI>Names;</HI> which is also demonstrable from some of them, as hath been shewn above. And though our <HI>Author</HI> is pleased to make light of the <HI>Argument</HI> from the <HI>Identity of Names</HI> to <HI>Identity of Offices,</HI> and many of his brethren have treated it with a great deal of <HI>contempt</HI> and <HI>insult:</HI> yet, I suppose, if the matter be <HI>duely weighed,</HI> it will be sound much easier to <HI>laugh at</HI> it, than to <HI>answer</HI> it</P>
<P>INDEED it must be acknowledged, that <HI>all▪</HI> the <HI>Names</HI> of the <HI>Offices</HI> of the <HI>Christian Church,</HI> admit of a <HI>twofold acceptation:</HI> being sometimes used in a <HI>common,</HI> and sometimes in an <HI>ap∣propriate sense,</HI> by the sacred Writers. Thus for instance; <HI>Apostle</HI> sometimes signifies <HI>any Messenger,</HI> and sometimes it is more strictly taken for <HI>one of the Twelve,</HI> immediately sent forth by our Lord. So <HI>Bishop,</HI> in its <HI>common</HI> acceptation, signifies an <HI>Overseer,</HI> and <HI>Presbyter</HI> signifies an <HI>old man;</HI> but they are both of them often used in a more <HI>appropriate sense,</HI> to denote those <HI>Officers,</HI> to whom the <HI>Instruction</HI> &amp; <HI>Government</HI> of the Churches were committed. So again, <HI>Deacon,</HI> in its <HI>common sense</HI> intends any <HI>servant</HI> or <HI>minister:</HI> but in its <HI>stricter use</HI> is <HI>appropriated</HI> to <HI>that Officer,</HI> whose business it was to <HI>serve Tables.</HI> And it is generally easy enough to discern from the sense, when these words are to be taken for the <HI>proper Names</HI> of the Offi∣cers sometimes denoted by them; and when they are to be taken in the <HI>common sense,</HI> only to intend <HI>something</HI> that may be <HI>as well</HI> expressed by <HI>them,</HI> as by any <HI>other words</HI> of the like signification.</P>
<P>NOW this Observation easily accounts for the <HI>difficulty,</HI> objected by our <HI>Author, that the</HI> Apostle <HI>&amp;</HI> Pastors <HI>are fre∣quently called</HI> Deacons; Upon which he truly says, <HI>That it
<PB N="60" REF="002594_0063_0FDB7E676A5802F8"/>
cannot thence be argued, that the</HI> Apostles <HI>&amp;</HI> Presbyter's <HI>Office was one and the same with the</HI> Deacon's. The reason of which is, that the word <HI>Deacon</HI> in those Places is used in its <HI>common sense,</HI> according to the <HI>original signification</HI> of it, before it was appropriated, as a <HI>name of distinction,</HI> to any <HI>particular Order of Officers</HI> in the Church. And this our Translators were a∣ware of; and accordingly, as the sense directed them, have very well rendred it <HI>Minister,</HI> in those places.</P>
<P>BUT notwithstanding this, it is certain (as hath already been observed) that <HI>this,</HI> and the <HI>other names</HI> of the <HI>Offices</HI> in the Christian Church, are often used in the New Testament, in a more <HI>strict</HI> &amp; <HI>appropriate</HI> sense, to denote certain Offices, which by these names were distinguished from each other. For common sense will teach us that there must be (at least) as many <HI>distinguishing names,</HI> as there were <HI>distinct Offices</HI> in the Church; and that <HI>distinction</HI> of <HI>names</HI> must be <HI>as early</HI> as the <HI>dis∣tinction of Offices:</HI> otherwise Christians must have been unable for some time, to express themselves in some Cases, either in Conversation, or in Writing, without an unintelligible Am∣biguity. Unless therefore our <HI>Author</HI> can prove, that the <HI>Scripture Offices</HI> were not distinguished in the <HI>Apostles days,</HI> by the <HI>names</HI> given them in <HI>Scripture;</HI> but by some <HI>other names,</HI> best known to himself, and not to be met with <HI>there;</HI> he must allow us to conclude, that wherever we meet with these <HI>names,</HI> evidently used in a <HI>strict appropriate sense,</HI> there we are to understand <HI>certain Officers,</HI> distinguished by these <HI>names</HI> from <HI>Officers</HI> of <HI>any other Order,</HI> and that could <HI>not</HI> be <HI>distinguished</HI> from <HI>other Orders,</HI> either in <HI>speaking</HI> or <HI>writing,</HI> without these <HI>distinguishing names,</HI> which custom had <HI>appropriated</HI> to them.</P>
<P>AND still further, where we find two of these names (tho' evidently used in a <HI>strict sense,</HI> yet) <HI>indifferently</HI> applied to the <HI>same Office,</HI> and <HI>never</HI> find them applied to <HI>any other Office,</HI> or <HI>any other names</HI> applied to <HI>that Office</HI> in an <HI>appropriate sense;</HI> there we must be allowed to conclude, that <HI>both</HI> these were <HI>names,</HI> which custom had given to <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same Office;</HI> and that it was well enough known at <HI>that time</HI> from all <HI>other Of∣fices</HI> by <HI>either</HI> of these <HI>names.</HI></P>
<P>NOW this is exactly the Case, with respect to the <HI>names, Presbyter</HI> &amp; <HI>Bishop.</HI> For where they are used in the most <HI>strict appropriate sense</HI> that can be, we find them <HI>both</HI> applied <HI>indif∣ferently</HI> to the <HI>Order of Officers,</HI> unto whom the <HI>Instruction</HI> &amp; <HI>Go∣vernment</HI> of the Church was committed. And we <HI>never</HI> find <HI>either</HI> of them applied, in a <HI>strict &amp; proper sense,</HI> to any <HI>other
<PB N="61" REF="002594_0064_0FDB7E68B88E64C0"/>
Order.</HI> Nor do we find the <HI>name Deacon,</HI> ever applied to <HI>this Order,</HI> but where it is <HI>manifestly</HI> used in the <HI>common,</HI> and not in the <HI>appropriate sense</HI> of the word. And therefore we very justly conclude, that not <HI>two,</HI> but <HI>one</HI> and <HI>the same</HI> Office, is intended by <HI>both</HI> these <HI>names;</HI> and that <HI>this Office</HI> was suffi∣ciently distinguished in the <HI>Apostles time,</HI> by <HI>either</HI> of them.</P>
<P>FOR it would be the most unreasonable thing in the world, to imagine, that there could be <HI>two distinct Offices,</HI> to which these <HI>names</HI> belonged, and yet the <HI>names</HI> be certainly used <HI>pro∣miscuously;</HI> and never <HI>so</HI> used, as that any <HI>distinction</HI> of <HI>Offices</HI> can be collected from them; nor <HI>any other names</HI> given us by the sacred writers, to <HI>distinguish these Offices</HI> by▪ not the <HI>names</HI> of <HI>any other Office</HI> given in an <HI>appropriate sense,</HI> to the <HI>Office,</HI> to which <HI>these two names</HI> are, in <HI>such a sense</HI> promiscu∣ously applyed; nor lastly, either of <HI>these names</HI> ever given, in an <HI>appropriate sense,</HI> to any <HI>other Office,</HI> but that of <HI>instructing</HI> &amp; <HI>governing</HI> the Church.</P>
<P>BUT if we should let all this go for nothing, and take our <HI>Author</HI>'s own Account of the matter, it will be found to make <HI>strongly for our Opinion.</HI> For after he hath told us, <HI>that the Apostles &amp; Pastors are frequently called</HI> Deacons; and yet that <HI>it cannot thence be argued, that the Apostle</HI>'s <HI>&amp; Presbyter's Office was one &amp; the same with the Deacon</HI>'s: the reason he gives for it is, <HI>That the name of the</HI> Genus <HI>is usually given to the species; the superior Office including the inferior. All</HI> Apostles <HI>were</HI> Pres∣byters &amp; Deacons: <HI>tho' not</HI> vice versa; that is, tho' all <HI>Presbyters</HI> &amp; <HI>Deacons</HI> were not <HI>Apostles.</HI> So that according to him a <HI>superior Office</HI> might be called by the name of an <HI>inferior:</HI> but an <HI>inferior Office</HI> might not be called by the name of a <HI>superior,</HI> If therefore we can find the same persons, that are called <HI>Presbyters</HI> (and that <HI>certainly</HI> were <HI>Presbyters</HI> in <HI>fact</HI> as well as <HI>name</HI>) immediately after called <HI>Bishops,</HI> it will fol∣low, from our <HI>Author</HI>'s own way of reasoning, that <HI>Bishops</HI> were not an <HI>order superior</HI> to <HI>Presbyters.</HI> Now for an Instance of this, I will only refer him to the above mentioned, <HI>Acts</HI> 20. where those that are called <HI>Elders</HI> or <HI>Presbyters</HI> of the Church of <HI>Ephesus,</HI> ver. 17. (and who were certainly <HI>Presbyters pro∣perly so called,</HI> because there were more than one of them in the same Church) are called also <HI>Bishops,</HI> ver. 28. as hath been before observed.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="002594_0065_0FDB7E6A41334428"/>NOW, In the <HI>next</HI> place our <HI>Author</HI> comes to answer the Ar∣guments bro't by us for <HI>Presbyterian Parity,</HI> from several Texts; such as Matth. 20.25 <HI>The Lords of the Gentiles</HI> &amp;c. and the parallel places. Tho' 'tis to be observed; he grossly mis∣represents us, when he insinuates, that we plead <HI>this Text,</HI> or any of the others mention'd by him, as <HI>condemning all Imparity among Church.</HI> Officers, <HI>or a superiority of one</HI> Order <HI>above another</HI> or the like. For, we allow of the Distinction betwixt Offi∣cers of an <HI>ordinary</HI> Character, and Others invested with <HI>ex∣traordinary</HI> Powers: So likewise we distinguish between one ordinary Officer and another, and assert a difference of Order between <HI>Bishops</HI> &amp; <HI>Deacons.</HI> But what we make use of this Text for, is to prove a <HI>Parity</HI> of the <HI>Apostles</HI> among themselves, and so of <HI>Presbyters</HI> or Bishops among them∣selves.</P>
<P>I cannot give into his opinion, That this Text forbids <HI>only that</HI> Power &amp; Jurisdiction, <HI>which is exercised with imperious Bit∣terness &amp; Domination:</HI> but must beg leave to think (till I can obtain better Light) that it condemns and inhibits <HI>all manner</HI> of Superiority &amp; Dominion whatsoever, <HI>in the Case it relates to.</HI> And when our <HI>Author</HI> is pleas'd to say, <HI>It is not in∣terpreted to any such purpose, by any judicious Person of either Per∣swasion;</HI> he commits a grand <HI>Mistake,</HI> and betrays his want of Reading or Memory. For <HI>Some,</HI> I am sure, and I suppose <HI>Most,</HI> of the best <HI>Expositors,</HI> and other Writers, on the <HI>Anti-Episcopal</HI> Side, do maintain, That not only <HI>Tyranny,</HI> but <HI>Domi∣nion</HI> it self is here spoken of and forbidden Nay and there are Divines of note in the Church of <HI>England</HI> too, that agree to this Exposition. Dr. <HI>Whitaker</HI> saith, <HI>It is not Humility in the Domination, that is required; but the very Domination it self is forbidden</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Le Pontif. Ques.</HI> 1. <HI>Cop.</HI> 3.</NOTE>. Dr <HI>Willet</HI> says, <HI>Our Saviour here forbiddeth, that there shou'd be any Prince-like &amp; pompous Pre-eminence among Ecclesiastical Persons</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Synops.</HI> p. 270.</NOTE>. So Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> in his Notes on the Place, expresseth himself thus; <HI>I do not think</HI> Christ <HI>only for∣biddeth here such Dominion as is attended with Tyranny</HI>—: And he adds several weighty Reasons to enforce his Opinion; As (1.) <HI>Because St.</HI> Luke (in repeating this Passage) <HI>uses Words which will bear no such ill sense.</HI> (2.) <HI>Because Governors (whether among</HI> Jews <HI>or</HI> Gentiles) <HI>were not always guilty of this Male-Administration.</HI> And (3) <HI>Because Christ does not oppose to their Government, a</HI> just <HI>Dominion, but a</HI> Ministry <HI>only,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="002594_0066_0FDB7E6BB46E87F8"/>UNTO these, may be added two Arguments further. As (1.) It is not likely that our blessed Lord (who always paid and taught such a Reverence to the Civil Magistrate, shou'd at once brand all the <HI>Kings</HI> &amp; <HI>Governors</HI> in the Gentile World, as a Crew of <HI>Tyrants</HI> &amp; <HI>Oppressors,</HI> without any Exception or Distinction. For (as one <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anderson</HI>'s Def.</NOTE> observes) what cou'd have been the Effect of this, but to produce in his Followers an utter Aversion to <HI>Monarchy,</HI> and to turn 'em all into <HI>Republicans?</HI> I wonder then how our <HI>Author</HI> came to hit upon such an un∣happy Construction of our Saviour's Words. Had he been of the Principles of Those, <HI>who</HI> (he says) <HI>are for curbing the power of Princes,</HI> it would not have been so great a Surprize, to see him stumble into such a Mistake in his Zeal &amp; Precipitation: But for a Gentleman, who professes himself of the Persuasion of Those, that <HI>assert the just Rights &amp; Prerogatives of Princes, as the surest Foundation of a Kingdom</HI>'s <HI>Tranquility &amp; Happiness;</HI> for him, to put such a sense upon our Savior's Words, as must have a tendency to inflame the minds of Christians with very strong Prejudices against the Government of <HI>Kings</HI> &amp; <HI>Princes,</HI> seems to be a very unaccountable peece of Forgetfulness and Mistake.— But further, (2) I may argue from the <HI>occasion,</HI> upon which the Words were spoken by our Savior. 'Twas briefly this; The Mother of <HI>Zebedee</HI>'s Children came with her Sons to our <HI>Lord,</HI> worshipping him, and desiring a certain Favour of him, viz. That <HI>her two Sons might sit, the one on his right hand, and the other on his left hand in his Kingdom</HI> Now We cannot reasonably suppose, This Woman had any thing in View but a <HI>just Dominion;</HI> not Tyranny &amp; Oppression; but barely Power &amp; Authority: which, no doubt, she hop'd her Sons wou'd manage worthily — However, our Lord sees fit to reject her Desire; and takes occasion not only to forbid his Apostles the tyrannical and corrupt exercise of Au∣thority, but even all <HI>Principality</HI> &amp; <HI>Dominion</HI> it self, among themselves. And as <HI>Junius</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tom.</HI> 2. <HI>Contra</HI> Bellarm.</NOTE> observes, <HI>Instead of the Dominion desired, he enjoyne them a humble Ministry &amp; Service.</HI> And whereas it had been objected by <HI>Bellarmine,</HI> That <HI>Bishops</HI> are not here forbidden to exercise a Dominion like that of <HI>godly</HI> Kings, but only like that of <HI>tyrannical</HI> Kings, who know not GOD: <HI>Junius</HI> replies, <HI>We deny that there is any such Restriction, neither can it be proved.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="002594_0067_0FDB7E7285DF4BC0"/>THIS might suffice: but since our <HI>Author</HI> has taken a pretty deal of pains in making critical Remarks on the Text, to expound it out of our Service, if possible; I shall do him the Justice, particularly to examine all he has said.</P>
<P N="1">1st then, HE observes, <HI>That it</HI>'s <HI>only a</HI> Secular <HI>Dominion, that our Lord forbids,</HI> &amp;c. Where, by the way, He seems to <HI>retract</HI> what he had said just before, when he <HI>deny'd</HI> any other Dominion to be condemned, but <HI>only that which is exercised with imperious Bitterness.</HI> He has done well to correct himself, as he seems to do, when he here interprets it of <HI>secular</HI> Domi∣nion; which being mention'd without any Limitation or Qualification, we must suppose him to allow it forbidden to the Apostles <HI>intirely,</HI> whether <HI>exercised with Bitterness</HI> or not. Now this, methinks, is a good Advance towards the <HI>Condemna∣tion</HI> of his <HI>own</HI> Bishops, who so much affect <HI>State.</HI> Dignities, and sometimes sustain <HI>Civil</HI> Offices; therein approving themselves <HI>true Successors</HI> of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> while dreaming of an <HI>Earthly</HI> King∣dom. It was what so offended good old <HI>Latimer,</HI> that he is said in a Sermon to have advised King <HI>Edward</HI> VI. to <HI>unlord</HI> all the <HI>Lordly Bishops,</HI> and remove them from all their <HI>temporal Offices &amp; Employments, that they might follow their spiritual Plough. Tail.</HI>— Wise &amp; just Advice, it shou'd seem! For their frequenting the <HI>Court,</HI> attending the <HI>Council Table,</HI> sitting in <HI>Parliament,</HI> being sometimes <HI>Regents</HI> of the Kingdom, or <HI>Ambassadors</HI> abroad, and the like, must needs take them very much off from their more <HI>proper</HI> Work, as well as very little sute with their <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Character. Hence the Wisdom of a <HI>Church of England Parliament</HI> saw fit once to pass a Vote, That <HI>no Bishop should sit in Parliament, nor bear any sway in Temporal Affairs; and that no Clergyman shou'd be in the Com∣mission for the Peace.</HI> The Apostle observes upon this head; <HI>No man that warreth, entangleth himself with the Affairs of this Life;</HI> requiring <HI>Timothy,</HI> as a good Soldier, and <HI>Bishop</HI> of the Church of CHRIST, not to engage himself in any secular Negotiations: So Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> notes on the Place; and moreover observes to us, That the <HI>Apostolical Canons</HI> (so cal∣led) declare, Those <HI>Bishops</HI> ought to be <HI>deposed,</HI> who immerse themselves in <HI>worldly</HI> Affairs. — But I seem to have forgot∣ten, that our <HI>Author</HI> &amp; I have no Dispute about these Things; since he fairly confesses, that our Savior forbids his Apostles and Ministers to exercise <HI>Secular</HI> Authority.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="002594_0068_0FDB7E741871EB58"/>HOWEVER, I don't agree with him, that <HI>this</HI> was <HI>all.</HI> I presume this do'sn't reach the <HI>utmost meaning</HI> of our Saviour's. For, tho' he might have some View (as our <HI>Author</HI> observes) to the <HI>Jewish</HI> opinion of a <HI>Temporal Kingdom,</HI> and design partly to remove that Mistake; yet the Generality of the most ap∣prov'd Interpreters that I have seen, do suppose our Savior's Words also to have a Reference to their <HI>Ecclesiastical Capacity,</HI> and to forbid their Affectation of Pre-eminence &amp; Authority one over another in the <HI>Church.</HI>— And 'tis very observable that our Lord used often, in his Replies unto others, to have a meaning <HI>beyond</HI> the Drift of the Question put to him, and different from it.</P>
<P N="2">2. OUR <HI>Author</HI> observes; <HI>That Dominion, which the Lord, of the</HI> Gentiles <HI>exercised, was over their Subjects; not one over another.</HI> But how weak an Insinuation is this! Who knows not, How the Kings of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> have exercised <HI>Lordship,</HI> not only over their <HI>Subjects,</HI> but ever &amp; anon also over other <HI>Princes</HI> round about them! What mean Imperial Dignities, and petty Sovereignties!— I think our Text may be so turned, and perhaps not unfairly; <HI>The Princes of the</HI> Gentiles <HI>exercise Dominion over them,</HI> i. e. The People: <HI>and they that are Great,</HI> (such as Emperors) <HI>do exercise Authority upon them,</HI> that is, upon inferior Princes. <HI>But</HI> (says our Lord to his Apostles) <HI>it shall not be so among you.</HI> It is the Dominion of one <HI>Apostle</HI> over <HI>another,</HI> that is here forbidden: as seems evident from what is added, <HI>Whosoever will be chief</HI> among you, <HI>let him be your servant.</HI> And this is but agreeable to the Scope of the <HI>Woman's</HI> Request to our Lord, <HI>That her Sons</HI> (two of the A∣postles) <HI>might have the two</HI> highest <HI>Posts in his Kingdom,</HI> and sit above the other Ten; who are therefore said to be <HI>moved with indignation against the two Brethren, when they heard it.</HI> More∣over, it will be clearer still, if we consult the <HI>parallel Texts</HI> mention'd by our <HI>Author, (Luk.</HI> 9.47. &amp; <HI>Chap.</HI> 22.24.) where we find the <HI>occasion</HI> of our Lord's giving these hum∣bling Rules to his Apostles is said to be the <HI>Rising of a Strife &amp; Reasoning among them,</HI> which of them <HI>should be accounted the greatest.</HI>— Nothing then can be more evident, whatever the Superiority condemned here by our Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> might be, than that it was such an one, as was to be exercised by the <HI>Apostles</HI> over others of their <HI>own</HI> Number, and hath no respect to a Superi∣ority over any <HI>other</HI> Order: and therefore must necessarily be understood in a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Sense; unless our <HI>Author</HI> will
<PB N="66" REF="002594_0069_0FDB7E75B6737400"/>
joyn the <HI>Papists,</HI> and maintain <HI>Peter</HI>'s <HI>Supremacy:</HI> but then he will have the whole <HI>Protestant</HI> world against him, even his own Episcopal <HI>Brethren,</HI> who constantly make use of these very Texts in writing against the <HI>Bishop of Rome,</HI> who pretends to be St. <HI>Peter</HI>'s Successor, and claims to be <HI>oecumenical Primate!</HI> Now if the <HI>Romish Primacy</HI> is unlawful by virtue of these Texts, I believe any man will be hard put to't to give me a tolerable Reason, why the <HI>English Prelacy</HI> shou'd not be as well accoun∣ted unlawful too; for I think it has been sufficiently prov'd, that <HI>Presbyters,</HI> or Pastors, are the true <HI>Successors</HI> of the Apostles: and therefore, since there was a perfect <HI>Equality</HI> among the <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves, it follows there shou'd be the like among ordinary <HI>Ministers,</HI> who succeed them, and a Superiority of one Pastor over another must be esteem'd forbidden by our Savi∣our in these Texts we are considering.</P>
<P>VERY groundless are the <HI>Consequences</HI> that our <HI>Author</HI> draws from the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Interpretation of our Saviour's Words. This will not (as he insinuates) <HI>destroy the power of Ministers over their Flocks:</HI> for, it is only the Dominion of one <HI>Minister</HI> over <HI>another,</HI> that we suppose forbidden. Neither will it <HI>de∣stroy the power of Synods &amp; Councils,</HI> if they keep within their proper Limits, and assume not, what the inspired Apostle disclaim'd, <HI>A Dominion over the Faith of others.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. HE observes, That Phrase in Luke, <HI>He that is greatest a∣mong you,</HI> plainly implies a Superiority of Power:— But I pray, why not rather an <HI>Eminency</HI> of <HI>Gifts</HI> &amp; <HI>Personal worth,</HI> as is attributed to those Apostles, of whom we read <HI>They seemed to be Pillars.</HI> And how will he reconcile such a Construction, with what he asserts elsewhere, viz. <HI>That all the Apostles were equal!</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, He argues from the <HI>Example</HI> of CHRIST ministring to his Disciples, which he proposeth to their Imita∣tion, That <HI>the Command of ministring takes not away the Superio∣rity &amp; Power, since none will doubt, that Christ was Lord &amp; Supe∣rior.</HI> But there's <HI>no weight</HI> in this, if we consider the <HI>nature</HI> of the Argument from CHRIST's <HI>Example;</HI> it being taken <HI>a Majori.</HI> When he urges his own Example, in taking upon him the <HI>form of a Servant,</HI> and <HI>humbling</HI> himself to the <HI>meanest Offices</HI> for his <HI>Disciples,</HI> in order to shame them out of their <HI>foolish Ambition</HI> to appear in the <HI>Form of Princes,</HI> and to <HI>Lord it over</HI> one another; I say, in thus urging his own Example. He only argues from the <HI>greater</HI> to the <HI>less:</HI> As if he had said, If <HI>I,</HI> who am your <HI>supreme Lord,</HI> have stoop'd to minister unto <HI>you,</HI>
<PB N="67" REF="002594_0070_0FDB7E7748D65058"/>
How <HI>much more</HI> shou'd you my Disciples, who are <HI>Fellow-Servants</HI> under one Master, <HI>submit</HI> your selves one to another, and be <HI>ashamed</HI> any of you to strive after <HI>Superiority</HI> &amp; <HI>Pre-eminene</HI> over one another! — We may illustrate and confirm this Para∣phrase, by our Savior's own words elsewhere, (Joh. 13.14, 16.) <HI>If I then your Lord &amp; Master have washed your Feet, ye also ought to wash one anothers feet.—The servant is not greater than his Lord.</HI>—</P>
<P>BUT further,</P>
<P N="4">4. HE argues from <HI>our Saviour's Instituting Ministers of different Offices &amp; Degrees; first, Apostles, then the</HI> 70, &amp;c. that it can't be tho't he condemn'd a <HI>Disparity</HI> among <HI>Gospel-Ministers.</HI>— To this I answer, That here's either a <HI>Fallacy,</HI> or a mean <HI>begging of the Question.</HI></P>
<P>NO Body disputes an <HI>Imparity</HI> or <HI>Distinction</HI> of Order among Gospel-<HI>Officers;</HI> tho' we deny it among Officers of the <HI>same Kind,</HI> and particularly among <HI>Bishops, Pastors</HI> or Teachers.</P>
<P>HE argues from the 70, who have been long ago <HI>discharg'd;</HI> and Evidence brought, that CHRIST left them not in Com∣mission at his Ascension: or however, that they were not a <HI>distinct</HI> Order from the Apostles.</P>
<P>BUT if none of the former <HI>Objections</HI> will bear, He has another in Store—</P>
<P N="5">5. HE adds, <HI>If our Lord had design'd to forbid</HI> all Disparity <HI>among the Ministers of the Gospel;</HI> 'Tis like, he wou'd <HI>rather</HI> have stated the <HI>Opposition</HI> between Them, and the <HI>Ministers</HI> of Religion under the <HI>Mosaic</HI> Dispensation, and not the <HI>Lords</HI> of the <HI>Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to this the Answer is easy. Our Savior chose this Comparison to <HI>meet more fully</HI> with the carnal Notion, our <HI>Author</HI> just now mention'd, of an <HI>Earthly Kingdom</HI> &amp; <HI>Civil Do∣minion,</HI> which the Disciples (with the Jews) dreamt of; as well as at the same time to <HI>reprove</HI> their <HI>Ambition</HI> of Superi∣ority to one another.</P>
<P>IT might be added, (as I find a Learned Man <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Anders.</HI> Def. pa. 84.</NOTE> observing) that our Lord did <HI>not</HI> state the opposition 'twixt Them, and the <HI>Jewish</HI> Priests, because the Disciples did not as yet think of any other Church-Government than what at present obtain∣ed among the <HI>Jews,</HI> and CHRIST did not find them ripe for receiving any Intimation thereof; but tho't it enough to give
<PB N="68" REF="002594_0071_0FDB7E7888B00F60"/>
them a <HI>general Rule</HI> to be observed by them afterwards, which (when it was to be put in practice) they wou'd easily con∣ceive the meaning of, after <HI>their Understandings were opened,</HI> and <HI>all Things brought to their Remembrance</HI> by the Holy Ghost. This Thought is suggested to us by Mr. <HI>Dodwel</HI> (that celebrated Champion of the Church of <HI>England) The Apostles themselves</HI> (saith he) <HI>do not seem to have known any thing concerning the Government of the Church, till their Separation from the</HI> Synagogues: <HI>They were by Birth</HI> JEWS, <HI>and zealous of the Law &amp; Customs of their Fathers, and if our Lord (before that) had ravealed any thing to them which looked that way, that is, a</HI> Change <HI>of Govern∣ment, they had been in hazard of revolting from him, instead of obey∣ing him. And therefore our Lord dealt cautiously with them, and wou'd not put new wine into old Bottles, nor while their Minds were yet alienated, bear in new Revelations upon them concerning Facts, from which They wou'd have had an Aversion.</HI>—</P>
<P>THUS I have (I hope) remov'd all that our <HI>Author</HI> has offer'd to invalidate our Objection against <HI>Prelacy</HI> from our Savior's Rule in <HI>Mat.</HI> 20.25, 26.— And have vindicated the <HI>Parallel Places</HI> therewith.</P>
<P>YET I wou'd take particular Notice of the last Text our <HI>Author</HI> mentions, that is, 1 Pet. 5.2, 3. <HI>Feed the Flock of God, which is among you, taking the oversight thereof</HI> (or acting as Bishops over it,) <HI>not by constraint, but willingly, not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready mind: neither as being Lords over God's Heritage, but being Ensamples to the Flock.</HI> He brings in this, as a <HI>parallel place,</HI> but I do not remember at present, that I have known it to be improv'd by any of our Persuation, to the same purpose with the other Texts: So that it seems <HI>not fair &amp; ingenuous Dealing in him</HI> to mention it as so alledged. However since it falls in my way, I will observe upon it, with our <HI>Author,</HI> That <HI>Lording over GOD's Heritage</HI> is here expresly discharg'd or forbidden. From this Text it is plain that Gospel-Bishops are not to be <HI>Lording</HI> Bishops; are not to exercise <HI>Princelike</HI> or <HI>Masterly</HI> Dominion over their Flocks. CHRIST will have no such Government, either of Ministers over Ministers, or of Ministers over their Flocks: The A∣postle disclaim'd it, 2 Cor. 1.24. <HI>Not for that we have Dominion over your Faith, but are Helpers of your Joy.</HI> So, 1 Cor. 3 5. <HI>Who is</HI> Paul? <HI>And Who</HI> is Apollos? <HI>But</HI> Ministers, <HI>by whom ye believed!</HI> 2 Cor. 4.5. <HI>We preach not our selves, but Christ Jesus the</HI> LORD, <HI>and our selves your</HI> SERVANTS <HI>for Jesus sake.</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="002594_0072_0FDB15BEAAAE6FF8"/>
<Q>Hence (as Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> observes <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Notes on <HI>Mat.</HI> 20.25.</NOTE>) are they so often stiled <HI>Ministers,</HI> and their Work a <HI>Ministry</HI> to the Saints: And therefore, saith he, All the Office any man can have in the Kingdom of CHRIST, can only be a larger <HI>Ministry</HI> to others. The Office of Ministers is to reveal the <HI>Will of</HI> CHRIST. He will allow them no such Power over others, as to rule them by their <HI>own Will,</HI></Q> in an arbitrary way; to set up themselves for <HI>Lawgivers</HI> or <HI>Dictators,</HI> expecting that the People should entertain all their Doctrines with an implicit Faith, and yield a blind Obedience to all their Decrees &amp; Canons.— This is indeed <HI>Lording</HI> over GOD's Heritage. And wou'd to GOD there had been less of this <HI>Domineering</HI> Spirit in the Christian World! I am sure there ought not to be (to use Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI>'s <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Notes on <HI>Eph</HI> 4.4.</NOTE> phrase) any such <HI>Magisterial Guides</HI> in the Church.</P>
<P>OUR <HI>Author</HI> consents to the Discharging of this <HI>Domineering</HI> in Ministers over their Flocks; yet he well observes, The <HI>Pastor's Power &amp; Authority over them, is expresly asserted</HI> (Heb. 13.7, 17.) <HI>where they are called Rulers, and the People comman∣ded to obey them.</HI> Yea, He might have observed, That the same is asserted in <HI>our Text,</HI> 1 Pet. 5.2. where the Presbyters are exhorted to <HI>feed the Flock of God, taking the oversight thereof,</HI> &amp;c. Here's a plain Text for the spiritual Jurisdiction and ruling Power of <HI>Presbyters.</HI> 'Tis couched in two Words. FEED <HI>the Flock;</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>; a word, <Q>which (as one <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Tong</HI>'s Def. pa. 21.</NOTE> observes) the Defenders of the Hierarchy contend, does not signify barely to <HI>Feed,</HI> but to provide Food as the <HI>Governor</HI> of a Fa∣mily, and 'tis often used for Goverment, and sometimes for that of <HI>Princes:</HI> but however, it certainly signifies the Of∣fice of a Pastor and is a good Argument that the Pastoral Power is vested in <HI>Presbyters.</HI> The other word is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Taking the Oversight,</HI> Performing the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Office, or doing the work of <HI>Bishops.</HI> So then Episcopal Jurisdiction belongs to Presbyters. If this Text does not prove it, I despair of of ever understanding the Meaning of Words. — The Power of <HI>Orders</HI> is with the like Clearness attributed to Presbyters in other places of Scripture; notwithstanding what our <HI>Author</HI> has said to the contrary.</Q></P>
<P>IN the 3d and last place, He comes to consider a Text brought for <HI>Presbyterian Ordination,</HI> viz. That of the Apostle,
<PB N="70" REF="002594_0073_0FDB7E7DFAF579B0"/>
1 Tim. 4.14. <HI>Neglect not the Gift— which was given Thee — with the Laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery.</HI> We judge it evident from this Place, That <HI>Presbyters have a Right &amp; Power to ordain Presbyters.</HI> And I think, nothing he has said do's at all disprove it. As for <HI>Jerom</HI>'s acknowlegement, that Ordination belongs, if not <HI>solely,</HI> yet <HI>chiefly,</HI> to <HI>Bishops;</HI> this don't at all move me: because it is well known, that what∣ever <HI>Jerom</HI> thought peculiar to <HI>Bishops,</HI> he thought to be so, <HI>rather by the Custom of the Church, than by Divine Appointment</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Magis Consuetudine, quam dispositionis Dominicae Veritate, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> <BIBL><HI>Hieron. in Epis. ad Tit. cap. 6.</HI></BIBL></Q></NOTE>. And what tho' <HI>Jerom,</HI> and several of the <HI>Latins,</HI> interpreted the <HI>Presbytery</HI> in our Text, to be the <HI>Office</HI> of Presbyters, as <HI>Calvin</HI> has done since; yet <HI>Chrysostom</HI> and other of the <HI>Greek</HI> Fathers (who must be supposed to understand <HI>their own</HI> Lan∣guage at least as well) do interpret it of the <HI>Consistory;</HI> not of the Office of Presbyters. And so the word is always used <HI>elsewhere</HI> in the New Testament. Instances of which you may find, <HI>Luk.</HI> 22.66. <HI>Acts</HI> 22.5 &amp;c. Where the word <HI>cannot</HI> be understood of <HI>Office,</HI> but must intend the <HI>Consistory</HI> or Commu∣nity of Presbyters. And in the <HI>latter</HI> Text, it is render'd, <HI>The Estate of the Elders,</HI> Ordo Seniorum, <HI>The Council of Presbyters.</HI> And indeed Criticks tell us, that the <HI>Presbyterate</HI> or Office of Presbyter is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, and not <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the word used here, which they say always signifies the <HI>Consistory.</HI></P>
<P>BUT our <HI>Author</HI> objects, that <HI>if we</HI> should <HI>grant that the Presbytery is to be understood here, of the</HI> Meeting <HI>of Presbyters, yet it will not prove, that they had full power &amp; authority to ordain; for here</HI> (says he) <HI>at the most they did but concur &amp; assist in the ordination of</HI> Timothy, <HI>as is evident from</HI> 2 Tim. 1.6. <HI>Where the Apostle calling on him to stir up that Gift,</HI> says of it, <HI>which is in Thee, by the Putting on of</HI> MY <HI>Hands.</HI></P>
<P>TO which I answer; If we take this to refer to <HI>Timothy</HI>'s <HI>Or∣dination</HI> (which is questioned by many) altho' it appears from hence, that the Apostle <HI>laid on hands,</HI> as well as the Assembly or Council of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> in the Ordination of <HI>Timothy:</HI> yet that gives us no more grounds to suspect, That <HI>the Presbyters had not full power &amp; authority to ordain by themselves,</HI> than it does to suspect whether the <HI>Apostle had power to ordain by himself.</HI> For the Apostle plainly attributes as much to <HI>the laying on of the hands of the Presbytery,</HI> in the <HI>first</HI> Epistle, as he does to <HI>the putting on of his own hands,</HI> in the <HI>other;</HI> which it would

be very unreasonable for him to do, if the <HI>Presbytery</HI> had not had the <HI>same power</HI> with <HI>himself</HI> in <HI>that</HI> Case. And if instead of the hands of the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> in the <HI>first</HI> Epistle, it had been said, that <HI>Timothy</HI> was ordained by the <HI>laying on of the hands of the</HI> BISHOP, (notwithstanding the mention of the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s hands also in the <HI>second</HI> Epistle,) I question not, but our <HI>Author</HI> wou'd have triumphed in it, and tho't the Text <HI>decisive.</HI> Whereas now he tells us, <HI>it is certain that Apostles did ordain without the Concurrence of Presbyters; but he reads not that ever Presbyters or∣dained without an Apostle or Bishop:</HI> And <HI>without a warrant or precedent to be found for it in Scripture, he knows not how any can be fully persuaded in his own mind.</HI> I can't tell whether it will help our <HI>Author</HI> under his doubts, or perplex him still more, to mention what some have observed, <HI>that the Scriptures are wholly silent about ordination by a Bishop; that indeed they sometimes speak of ordination by the Apostles, and the Apostles sometimes call them∣selves Elders or Presbyters; but they read not that the Apostles are ever called Bishops in the New Testament; or that the laying on of hands, either without an Apostle, or with one, is any where ascribed to any person that is called a Bishop in the word of GOD.</HI> This Observation may perhaps draw some weak persons into doubts about the validity of <HI>Episcopal Ordination.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the truth of the Case is, (as hath been, I hope, abun∣dantly proved, in the preceding pages) that <HI>Bishops</HI> &amp; <HI>Presby∣ters</HI> are one and the same <HI>Order</HI> by <HI>Divine Institution;</HI> and that they succeed the <HI>Apostles</HI> in all their <HI>ordinary</HI> Powers, of which that of <HI>Ordination</HI> is one; which is warrant enough for <HI>Ordination</HI> by Presbyters, and the very same warrant which <HI>those</HI> have for it, who are now, by <HI>Custom,</HI> and <HI>humane Consti∣tutions,</HI> dignified and distinguished with the Title of <HI>Bishops.</HI> But if our <HI>Author</HI> must have a <HI>precedent</HI> as well as a <HI>warrant</HI> for Ordination by Presbyters, and such a <HI>Praecedent</HI> too as no <HI>Apostle</HI> was concerned in; I might with as good reason in∣sist upon his giving an <HI>Instance</HI> of such an <HI>Ordination,</HI> by any person, or persons that are any where called <HI>Bishops.</HI> How∣ever, if he will please to read <HI>Acts</HI> 13. <HI>begin▪</HI> and then con∣sider what he himself understands by <HI>Prophets &amp; Teachers,</HI> (pag. 36, 38.) and what he takes to be the design of <HI>prayer &amp; Imposition of hands</HI> (pa. 12.) I hope he will find a <HI>Praecedent</HI> to his heart's desire, in which no <HI>Apostle,</HI> (nor <HI>Diocesan Bishop)</HI> was otherwise than <HI>passively</HI> concerned.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="002594_0075_0FDB7E81A121C020"/>I thought now to have drawn to a Close; but I must beg leave to take Notice here of a Passage or two in our <HI>Author</HI>'s CONCLUSION; wherein he seems to intend something <HI>New</HI> of Argument.</P>
<P>Pag. 61. HE observes, <HI>We cannot find in all the New Testament the least Insinuation, that after a short Time</HI> the Apostolical Power over ordinary Pastors <HI>was to cease:</HI> which is the same Argument that Dr. <HI>Scot</HI> brings &amp; builds much upon; who speaking of the Apostolick Office says, <Q>Men must prove it's repealed by the same Authority that establisht it, before they presume to renounce it; for (says he) The Obliga∣tion of Divine Commands is dissolvable only by Divine Countermands: so that tho' GOD had not declared he instituted it for Perpetuity; yet till he declare the contrary, the Institution must bind &amp; prescribe to all Ages &amp; Nations.</Q>
But methinks, this admits of an easy Answer. For what need is there of an express Repeal or formal Inhibition, where the Reason of the Thing ceaseth, as is apparently the Case before us! I think it has been sufficiently prov'd, That the Aposto∣lic Power spoken of, was founded in <HI>peculiar</HI> &amp; <HI>extraordinary</HI> Ends and Designs, respecting the Infancy of the Gospel-Dispensation; That there's nothing in the <HI>Nature</HI> &amp; Reason of things requiring the Continuance of it, nor the least Inti∣mation given in <HI>Scripture,</HI> to move us to think it any other than Temporary. But after all I have said, I don't know whether our <HI>Author</HI> and his Brethren will be convinced. If not, I wish they would go to School to an eminent Divine of their own Church, and a great Ornament of it, tho' he was not in Communion with them in these Notions; I mean the Lear∣ned Dr. <HI>Barrow,</HI> who freely declares his Judgment, <Q>That the Apostleship, as such <HI>(strictly speaking)</HI> was personal and temporary, and in all respects extraordinary; conferred in a special manner, design'd for special purposes, discharged by special aids, endowed with special privileges, as was needful for the propagation of Christianity &amp; founding of Churches: That the Apostles did not pretend to commu∣nicate it: That they did indeed appoint standing Pastors and Teachers in each Church, but not constitute Apostles: and that (as saith <HI>Bellarmine</HI>) Bishops have no true Apostolical Authority: That this in its Nature &amp; Design was not communicable to others, &amp;c.</Q> Thus Dr. <HI>Barrow</HI> in his Treatise of the <HI>Pope's Supremacy,</HI> pag. 73, &amp;c. whose works are publish'd by Arch-Bishop <HI>Tillotson;</HI> and so perhaps we
<PB N="73" REF="002594_0076_0FDB7E83112A5D08"/>
have the Sentiments of this eminent Doctor also here expressed.</P>
<P>Now further,</P>
<P><HI>Pag.</HI> 62. OUR <HI>Author</HI> argues against the Presbyterian Principle, from <HI>its dangerous Consequence to Religion,</HI> as if it <HI>open'd a Gap to all Errors,</HI> and led to the Subversion of the whole Gospel-Ministry.— This, I suppose, he might think wou'd give us an alarm, and make us look to our selves, and beware how we attempt to shake Episcopacy, lest <HI>Presbytery</HI> shou'd unhappily fall with it. But I see no Cause for such a Fear. Besure I can see no ground to appre∣hend any <HI>more</HI> danger in <HI>our</HI> affirming the Apostles Au∣thority over Pastors to be <HI>wholly</HI> &amp; absolutely extraordinary, than in our <HI>Author</HI>'s affirming their <HI>unlimited Commission</HI> was so. Neither am I able to discern how it may any more, or on any better grounds, be <HI>improv'd against the Office of a Presbyter:</HI> Nor indeed how it can <HI>at all</HI> be so improv'd, with any shew of Reason. For the <HI>Necessity</HI> of a Gospel-Ministry may be evinced by many Arguments of a <HI>moral</HI> Nature: The Ends &amp; Grounds of it being manifestly such as agree to all Ages of the Church to the End of the World. And then there is the clearest <HI>Scrip∣ture-Proof</HI> imaginable that it was <HI>design'd</HI> to be perpetual. <HI>We have the same Evidence for the perpetual Duration of</HI> the Pastoral Office, <HI>as we have for its first Institution:</HI> whereas no solid Arguments have as yet been brought to support the <HI>Episcopal</HI> Claim, either from Reason or Scripture. So that the Presbyterians Renoun∣cing of this, cannot in the least tend to serve the Design of those that are for intirely casting off a standing Ministry: and if such have nothing better to say in Defense of their Princi∣ple, than what our <HI>Author</HI> hath suggested in their behalf, we see no occasion for much Fear from this Quarter.</P>
<P><HI>AND now having finish'd what I design'd,</HI> that is, having shown the Weakness of our <HI>Author</HI>'s supposed <HI>Demonstrations,</HI> and the Inconsistency of <HI>his</HI> Account with the <HI>Scripture-account of these matters; I shall only add, by way of Conclusion,</HI> some of his own <HI>Expostulations</HI> (with a little alteration, turned upon himself and those of his persuasion) <HI>in the Spirit of meekness &amp; Love; and calmly inquire</HI> (with him) <HI>what is the ground of all that Noise &amp; Clamour, Hatred &amp; Prejudice, raised against them who are of the principles, as to the Point of Church-Government, which</HI> I have been defending?</P>
<P><HI>'TIS evident we own</HI> CHRIST JESUS <HI>to be</HI> sole <HI>Lord &amp; Law∣giver to his Church; that he hath Power to establish Order &amp; Govern∣ment therein, and to institute what Offices he pleaseth in his spiritual
<PB N="74" REF="002594_0077_0FDB7E8499BAC2F0"/>
Kingdom.</HI> These are the Things we earnestly contend for.</P>
<P><HI>WE are fully persuaded, that He, who is of infinite Wisdom &amp; Goodness, hath disposed all Affairs relating to the Government of his Church, in the most excellent Method, to promote the Edification &amp; Salvation of his People.</HI> And therefore we cannot consent, that the Foolishness of Men should intermeddle and alter the Constitutions of Divine Wisdom.</P>
<P><HI>WE plainly find</HI> but one Order of <HI>Officers,</HI> the Eleven <HI>Apostles,</HI> left in the Church by CHRIST himself at his Ascension into Heaven: and one Order more, <HI>the seven Deacons,</HI> instituted afterwards by the Apostles under the Conduct of the Spirit of GOD. <HI>These</HI> two <HI>Orders are unquestionably of Divine Institu∣tion;</HI> but more we cannot find to be so. We desire to pre∣serve to each of these, all the <HI>ordinary Powers</HI> they were en∣trusted with by Divine Appointment; and not to thrust either of them into Employments, which the wisdom of GOD never allotted to them. We are far from saying that either of these Offices was <HI>temporary.</HI> We only affirm, that the for∣mer of them had some Powers at the beginning, which were <HI>extraordinary</HI> &amp; <HI>temporary,</HI> and expired with the Persons they were committed to: but that as to their ordinary Powers, they have been, and shall be succeeded, to the <HI>end of the World,</HI> by <HI>Presbyters</HI> or <HI>Bishops,</HI> whom we every where find in Scrip∣ture to be one and the same Order.</P>
<P><HI>AND now let any impartially judge, who do most truly assert Christ's Kingly Office, and the Prerogatives of his Crown: WE, who plead for his Institution, and closely adhere thereunto, and to the Offices which he hath appointed in his Church;</HI> without increa∣sing their Number, or adding to, or taking any thing away from, the <HI>ordinary Powers,</HI> he committed to either of them. <HI>Or</HI> THEY, <HI>who make bold with his Institution,</HI> to alter it as they please: who have set up more Offices in the Church, than were appointed by CHRIST and his Apostles; who call upon those to preach &amp; baptise, whose only Business, by Divine Appointment, is to serve Tables: and who have <HI>cashier'd</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Auth.</HI> pag. 40.</NOTE> in a great measure <HI>CHRIST</HI>'s <HI>prime Officers &amp; Representatives, and the Churches principal Guides, and have depriv'd the Church</HI> very much of the Benefit of these <HI>Pledges of her Lord's Care and Kindness,</HI> the Pastors &amp; Teachers, <HI>which he gave her, when he ascen∣ded up to Heaven:</HI> who have intirely wrested the Power of Go∣vernment, and wou'd take that of Ordination also, out of the
<PB N="75" REF="002594_0078_0FDB7E8613A8BAE8"/>
Hands of perhaps Ninety nine in an Hundred of Those to whom CHRIST himself by his Commission gave them; <HI>and this only upon a false &amp; groundless Supposition,</HI> that the Apostles Authority over Pastors was one of their ordinary Powers, and inherited by Bishops, as an Order of Men by Divine Right superior to Presbyters, and succeeding to the Apostles. <HI>The Falseness of which I have already shewed; and shall now represent briefly of what dangerous Consequence it is to Religion.</HI> — To deny <HI>Presbyters</HI> the power of <HI>Ordination,</HI> is in effect to deny the <HI>validity</HI> of all the Administrations of Those, who are not under the Episcopal Form of Government; or who, if under it now, yet derive the Succession of their <HI>Bishops</HI> from such as were ordain'd by <HI>Presbyters:</HI> which is to number far the biggest part of the Protestant Churches, and in all probabi∣lity the Church of <HI>England</HI> it self, among <HI>Aliens</HI> from the Common-Wealth of <HI>Israel,</HI> and <HI>Strangers</HI> from the Covenants of Promise, who have no hope, &amp; are without CHRIST, and without GOD in the World! — To alledge <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Auth.</HI> pag. 39.</NOTE> that <HI>Bishops are the true Successors to the Apostles, or else they have no Successors at all;</HI> and that <HI>Presbyters succeed only to the Seventy, having no Claim to the Commission given to the Apostles at our Lord's Ascension, or to the Promise annexed;</HI> This surely <HI>is to make the Rule and Standard of our Religion uncertain &amp; unfixed, and opens a Gap to all Errors</HI> and Confusions. To put Ecclesiastical Government into Lay-Hands, and <HI>To set up new Offices paramount to those that CHRIST has appointed, and to alter any of his holy Institutions, What intolerable Presumption is it?—At this Rate &amp; upon the like Pretences,</HI> Papists set up several more Officers, particu∣larly Cardinals, and paramount to all, the POPE, claiming Apostolical Power &amp; Infallibility, pretending to be CHRIST's Vicar, the great Monarch &amp; visible Head of the Church Ca∣tholick; from whom all other Ecclesiastical Ministers de∣rive their Authority; <HI>Necessary</HI> (say they) for the deciding of Controversies, for preserving the Unity of the Church, and rendering the <HI>New-Testament</HI> Church, conformable to the Church of the <HI>Old Testament,</HI> which had a <HI>High Priest</HI> above all.</P>
<P>NOW <HI>if any thus principled cou'd but gain such an Ascendent over the Populace, as to inspire them with this</HI> unhappy <HI>Notion, and thereby influence them as much</HI> in favour of the Romish Papacy, <HI>as they have been</HI> for the English Prelacy; <HI>what shou'd then become of Order in the Church?</HI> GOD
<PB N="76" REF="002594_0079_0FDB7E8912A2FB18"/>
<HI>forbid! That any such wild Caprice should ever sieze on a</HI> Protestant People! <HI>But I make the Supposition to represent thereby the dan∣gerous Consequence of that Principle,</HI> That there are by Divine Appointment <HI>Bishops</HI> of a distinct &amp; superior Order to <HI>Pastors</HI> and Teachers; always <HI>necessary</HI> for the Good of the Church, and without which the Apostles have no Successors <HI>at all,</HI> nor is any Church rightly constituted. <HI>For it may be improv'd</HI> very <HI>much</HI> in favour of Popery; and I think can be defended by no Arguments, but what unhappily make against the Pro∣testant Reformation—. <HI>And there may come an unhappy Juncture when</HI> the Papacy <HI>may come to be thought as</HI> needful as Prelacy. <HI>For alas! If the Truth may be told, 'tis greatly to be fear'd, that</HI> the power of Pastors, and the strict Discipline commonly used in Presbyterial Churches, <HI>is become intolerable to too many carnal Libertines,</HI> whose Language is that, <HI>Come, let us break their Bonds asunder, and cast away their Cords from us:</HI> and that not a few, who with an uncharitable &amp; bitter Zeal contend for the E∣piscopal Pre eminence, have too much of the Roman Leaven in them; are too sincere Friends to the Papal Supremacy, <HI>and only want a favorable Opportunity to vent their Minds,</HI> and throw off the Mask: Or at least they may be suppos'd in no little danger of contracting a Reverence &amp; Affection to it; since this furious Zeal for a difference of Order among Gospel-<HI>Ministers,</HI> seems to tend by a natural Efficacy to beget favora∣ble Thoughts of a Distinction <HI>&amp;</HI> Subordination among <HI>Bishops</HI> likewise, and to prepare the Mind to embrace the Notion of a <HI>supreme</HI> Bishop; and so to pave the way for their Return to a humble Submission to the Pontificate of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HOW will they be able to answer to GOD and their own Con∣sciences for it? Who have combined together</HI> to propagate <HI>Doctrines</HI> so <HI>unscriptural</HI> in themselves; so uncharitable &amp; unmerciful in their Consequences, and in their tendency, so fatal to <HI>that Order settled by</HI> CHRIST <HI>in his Church; and who have left no Stone unturned in their restless Endeavours, to bring the sacred</HI> Mi∣nistry of Presbyterian <HI>Bishops &amp; Pastors into perpetual Contempt, and have industriously set themselves to oppose &amp; frustrate all their Gospel Administrations; and not only to alienate the minds of poor simple People from</HI> those <HI>their</HI> Rightful <HI>Governors and Pastors; but with Noise &amp; Clamour, and bitter Invectives</HI> have too often endeavoured <HI>to inspire them with the highest Rage &amp; Fury to com∣mit the most horrid Outrages on their sacred Persons, as good Service

done to GOD; and all upon no other account, but their firm adhe∣rence unto the Institutions of</HI> JESUS CHRIST.</P>
<P>I will now only add my sincere wishes, in the very <HI>Terms</HI> of our <HI>Author</HI>'s own concluding Collect:— <HI>Father, forgive them; they know not what they do: Lord, lay not this Sin to their Charge; But mercifully open their Eyes: that they may see the Evil of their Ways, and may be converted to the Way of Truth and Godliness, Peace &amp; Charity, Unity &amp; Order; and be eternally, saved, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</HI></P>
<P>THUS, Sir, I have in some measure perform'd what I undertook at your Request; have made my Remarks upon the most material Passages in the Book you sent me; and I suppose nothing that might be likely to lead unwary Readers into any considerable Mistakes, hath escap'd a sufficient Notice. The Discourse hath swell'd a great deal beyond my Expectations: and yet I have wav'd much of what might have been said under several Heads: and have past over divers Things in our <HI>Author,</HI> not unexceptionable, as being of lesser Consequence. Tho' I must confess, I have been now and then almost insen∣sibly drawn to debate some more <HI>minute Particulars,</HI> than I tho't at first to trouble you with any Reflections upon; and have set too great a Task to your Patience; but I trust your <HI>Candour</HI> will overlook &amp; excuse <HI>this,</HI> and all <HI>other Imperfections</HI> of my <HI>Performance.</HI> I have almost wholly confin'd my self to the <HI>Defensive part,</HI> or at least not meddl'd with any thing (that I remember) but what our <HI>Author</HI> has unavoidably led me into; because I was not willing to give any <HI>unnecessary Pro∣vocation.</HI> For which Reason also, I have hardly at all allow'd my self to address the <HI>Passions,</HI> or to write in the <HI>declamatory Strain</HI> at least not so much as <HI>some</HI> might perhaps reasonably have expected on this occasion; especially since our <HI>Author</HI> had set me an <HI>Example,</HI> by mixing so much of <HI>Harangue</HI> with his <HI>Arguings:</HI> for I am sensible it is no easy matter to write in this Method, without saying such Things as some wou'd think, however true &amp; just, yet <HI>grievous to be born,</HI> and touching too near. I have study'd to preserve a due <HI>Moderation,</HI> and <HI>Temper;</HI> which the Laws of Civility &amp; Christianity oblige to: and endeavored that nothing might fall from me, that could give offence to any, but such as will be offended at whatever thwarts their own Opinion; of which <HI>Sort of Persons</HI> there are
<PB N="78" REF="002594_0081_0FDB7E8BF557A3C0"/>
(it may be) too many in all Parties. It had been easy to have been <HI>tart</HI> &amp; <HI>severe</HI> in several places, where it may be there was sufficient <HI>provocation</HI> given: but I am none of those that love to be always dealing in <HI>Satyr.</HI> And if any Expressions have happen'd to slip from me, that may seem a little too <HI>warm</HI> or <HI>harsh,</HI> I shall be sorry for it.</P>
<P>WHAT Occasion there may be for making any thing of this Nature publick, you are in better Circumstances to judge than I. For, as I have written at <HI>your Desire;</HI> so my Reasons for it are owing very much to your Information. I therefore leave the Matter wholly to your <HI>Prudence:</HI> assuring you, that as I had rather my self suffer, than that the <HI>Truth</HI> shou'd for want of a sutable Defense: So on the other hand, I am unwilling to expose my self needlesly to the Ill-Will and Abuses, that may possibly arise, if you publish to the World these Papers, which come from,</P>
