<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THE yearly-meeting in 1783, having a concern for the revisal of our discipline, committed the important work to the meeting for sufferings, who, after waiting for a right qualification, proceeded on the business; and having the revisal of the London discipline of 1782, with those of our neigh∣bouring yearly-meetings as well as our own to compare, have with much labour and close attention, in the ability afforded, performed the same, which being laid before the last yearly-meeting, a large committee, consisting of friends from each quarter, were appointed to join the meeting for sufferings in examining the same, who being met accordingly, were favoured after se∣veral sittings to go through the work; and the whole, as contained in the fol∣lowing pages, was agreed to; and the yearly-meeting having committed to the meeting for sufferings the further care of communicating the same to the seve∣ral quarterly and monthly-meetings, they have thought fit to direct a suit∣able number of copies to be printed for that purpose, in order,</P>
<P N="1">1st. That every quarterly and monthly-meeting may be furnished with a fair and correct collection of the minutes and advices which have been agreed to, for regulating the affairs of the society.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. "That these minutes and advices being more generally received, may be more uniformly observed and put in practice, that order, unity, peace and harmony, may be preserved throughout the churches."</P>
<P N="3">3dly. "That in an especial manner the youth of the present and succeed∣ing generations may not only be early and more fully instructed in our reli∣gious principles, but in the nature and design of our Christian discipline; and through divine assistance be enabled to adorn our holy profession, by a con∣sistent conduct and circumspect conversation in all godliness and honesty,
<PB N="iv" REF="019014_0003_0FA958C3C43E78B8"/>thereby avoiding the reproach which many, through a defection in principle, or a degeneracy in practice, have brought upon themselves, and the body of which they profess to be members."</P>
<P N="4">4thly. "That the unfaithful, the immoral, and the libertine professors, may be seasonably reminded of their danger and of their duty, as well as of the great labour, which, in much gospel love, hath been from time to time bestowed for their help and recovery; and that such as continue to despise and reject the convictions of truth, and the counsel of their brethren, and refuse to be reclaimed, may be made sensible that they themselves are the cause of their separation from our religious fellowship and communion: For when any, by their inconsistent and disorderly conduct, or by imbibing and adopting principles or practices contrary to the doctrine which we have receiv∣ed, have first manifested their disunity with the society, it is but just and requisite, that, after endeavouring and waiting to restore them without effect, the body should testify its disunity with such erring and refractory members; at the same time earnestly desiring that they may be convinced of the error of their ways, and that through unfeigned repentance, and a consistent orderly conduct in future, they may be re-united to the body. This being the utmost extent of our discipline respecting offenders, it is very evident, that, from the right exercise thereof, no degree of persecution or imposition can be justly in∣ferred; for the imposition rests entirely on the part of those who insist on being retained as members, whilst at open variance with the body, either in principle or practice."</P>
<P>We are not however without a clear sense that this publication will prove insufficient to produce the desired effect, unless we are very careful to move and act under the immediate influence of the Spirit of Christ, in the pure love of the Gospel.</P>
<P>"And whilst we are earnestly recommending this work to the notice and regard of friends, we cannot omit to press upon them a diligent reading of the Holy Scriptures, as superior to all other writing for instruction; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="v" REF="019014_0004_0FA958C58A7CC0E0"/>must yield great satisfaction to observe how consonant these advices are to the doctrine and precepts of Christ and his apostles."</P>
<P>Although this collection is printed solely for the use of our own society, yet, should it get abroad and meet the public eye, it is not doubted but every serious and candid reader will observe, throughout the whole, the constant and earnest endeavours of the society for the promotion of virtue and religion.</P>

<HEAD>ARBITRATION.</HEAD>
<P>AGREED, that the choosing of arbitrators is proper in cases of differ∣ence about a man's property. 1684.</P>
<P>Whereas it sometimes happeneth, to the hurt of truth, and grief of many friends, that differences do arise amongst some professing truth, about outward things; it is therefore by this meeting thought convenient, and advised, that when any friend or friends shall hear of any such difference betwixt any friends in that meeting to which they do belong, that they forthwith speak to, and tenderly advise, the persons between whom the difference is, to make a speedy end thereof; and if that friend or those friends do not comply with their advice, that then they take to them one or two friends more, and again exhort them to end their difference; and if they or either of them refuse, then to let them know, that it is the advice and counsel of friends, that they should each choose an equal number of indifferent, impartial and judicious friends, to hear and speedily determine the same; and that they do bind themselves to stand to their award and determination, or the award and deter∣mination of the major part of them, that shall be made and signed by the arbitrators.</P>
<P>Also this meeting doth advise, that if any person professing the truth among us, and esteemed a friend, shall refuse speedily to end the difference, or refer it as before advised, complaint be made of that person or persons, unto the monthly-meeting to which he doth belong; and if after admonition he shall refuse so to refer his case, that then the meeting do testify against such person, and disown him to be of our society, until he shall comply with the equal methods and agreements of our society, and by such his compliance
<PB N="4" REF="019014_0013_0FA958D0B68D5500"/>doth declare that he is for peace, and doth seek and desire it: And when any person so refusing is testified against by the meeting, and disowned, the other person may have his liberty to seek his remedy against him at law. 1697.</P>
<P>Advised, that in all cases of controversy and difference, the persons con∣cerned therein either speedily compose the difference between themselves, or make choice of some faithful friends to determine the same; or otherwise, if they cannot agree upon the choice, to submit to the monthly-meeting's choice of certain persons meet to inspect and determine the controversy, and to stand to their award and final determination thereof; that such controver∣sies may not be continued, to cause a reproach. 1692.</P>
<P>And it is the advice of this meeting, that persons differing about outward things do, as little as may be, trouble public ministering friends with being arbitrators in such cases. 1697.</P>
<P>And that all persons differing be exhorted by the monthly-meeting to which they belong, when their cases are referred, and judgment and award made, signed and given thereupon, as aforesaid, to stand to and perform the said award, which they have bound themselves to perform: And if any shall refuse so to do, that then the monthly-meeting to which such person doth belong, upon notice thereof to them given, shall appoint a suitable committee to labour with him, and if he do not make it evident, that there is manifest error or injustice, they admonish him thereunto; and if after admonition he persist to refuse, then the meeting to testify against him as before; but if such error or injustice be made to appear, then the matter be reconsidered by the same or other arbitrators, as in the judgment of the monthly-meeting may appear best, and such correcting judgment be final. And the bonds of arbi∣tration are not to be considered binding and final, where evident error or injustice is made to appear, and it is advised that bonds be written accordingly; but where this is not manifest, such bonds be conclusive and final.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="019014_0014_0FA958D245FE7068"/>
It is the sense and judgment of this meeting, that if any person professing truth with us shall arrest, sue, or implead at law, any other of our members, before he hath proceeded in the methods herein before recommended, that such person doth therein depart from the principle of truth, and the known way thereof, and acts contrary thereunto, and ought to be dealt with by the meeting he belongs to for the same; and if he shall not give satisfaction to the meeting for such his disorderly proceeding, by condemning it, and him∣self therein, that then he be disowned by the meeting. 1697. 1692.</P>
<P>And if the party so sued or arrested taking with him, or if under confine∣ment, sending one or two friends to the person who goes to law, shall com∣plain thereof, the said person shall be required immediately to stay proceed∣ings; and if he does not comply with such requisition, the monthly-meeting to which he belongs shall disown him, if the case require it. 1782.</P>
<P>So much of the minute as doth relate simply to the entering into bonds, and so far as arbitrations may be refused on account of disputes and questions in law, relating to executors or trustees, where the property is not their own, in both these cases, that there be a particular and special regard had to the nature and circumstances of things, it not being either now, nor at the time of making the said minute, the intent of this meeting, in the above described or other cases, to lay any unwarrantable burthen upon any brother, nor up∣on the church of God. 1720.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="019014_0015_0FA958D28A889820"/>
The following Method is to be observed in proceeding in Arbitrations.</P>
<P N="1">1. Each party having chosen one or two indifferent, impartial and judi∣cious friends, those so chosen are to agree upon a third or a fifth friend, unless the parties first agree in the nomination, whose name shall be inserted with the others in the bonds of arbitration, or other written agreement.</P>
<P N="2">2. The arbitrators should not consider themselves as advocates for the party by whom they were chosen, but men, whose incumbent duty it is to judge righteously, fearing the Lord. They should shun all previous infor∣mation respecting the case, that they may not become biassed in their judg∣ments before they hear both parties together.</P>
<P N="3">3. The parties to enter into written engagements or bonds, if either of them require it, to abide by the award of the arbitrators, or a majority of them, to be made in a limited time.</P>
<P N="4">4. Every meeting of the arbitrators must be made known to the parties concerned, until they have been fully heard, nor shall there be any separate private meetings between some of the arbitrators, or with one party separate from the other, on the business referred to them; and no representation of the case of one party, either by writing or otherwise, be admitted, without its being fully made known to the other, and, if required, a copy to be de∣livered to the other party.</P>
<P N="5">5. The arbitrators are to hear both parties fully, in the presence of each other, whilst either hath any fresh matter to offer, until a certain time, to be limited by mutual agreement. Let no evidence or witness be withheld or rejected.</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="7" REF="019014_0016_0FA958D3604BE608"/>
6. If there should appear to the arbitrators, or any of them, to be any doubtful point of law, they are jointly to agree upon a case, and consult council thereupon.</P>
<P>The arbitrators are not required to express in the award their reasons for their decision. One writing of the award is to be delivered to each party.</P>
<P>It is recommended to arbitrators to propose to the parties, that they should give an acknowledgment in writing, before the award be made, that they have been candidly and fully heard.</P>
<P>Matters of defamation are not subjects to be arbitrated, until the defa∣mation is proved, and that some injury is sustained by the defamed in his trade, calling or property; and in that case the damage should be submitted to arbit<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> 1782.

<P>AGREED that the meeting for sufferings take care to the inspecting, ordering and regulating the press, and printing of books; and that no manuscripts be printed without their approbation.</P>
<P>Recommended that each monthly-meeting take off two books of a sort newly printed, if under the price of six shillings; and one book to each meet∣ing, if the value is more; and that one book of a sort be kept in each quar∣terly-meeting. 1695.</P>
<P>That friends be diligent in spreading friends books, which are answers to adversaries, and to ger them exposed to sale, where the adversaries books are sold; and this to be done in due time, and not delayed till the service may be partly over. 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</P>
<P>It is agreed that th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> meeting for sufferings do distribute friends books in such manner, and to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch parts of the world, as they think proper. 1732.</P>
<P>The families of poor friends to be provided with friends books, particu∣larly such as are adapted to the instruction and edification of their children. 1754.</P>
<P>This meeting considering that some in the present age do endeavour, as well by certain books, as a licentious conversation, to lessen and decry the true faith in our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, even that precious faith once delivered to his faints, which by the mercy of God is also bestowed upon us, do therefore earnestly advise and exhort all parents, masters and mistresses of families, and guardians of minors, that they prevent, as much as in them lies, their children, servants, and youth, under their respective care and tuition, from the having or reading books or papers that have any ten∣dency
<PB N="10" REF="019014_0018_0FA958D785D1E610"/>to prejudice the profession of the Christian religion, to create in them the least doubt or question concerning the truth of the Holy Scriptures, or those necessary and saving truths declared in them; lest their infant and feeble minds should be poisoned thereby, and a foundation laid for the greatest evils. 1723.</P>
<P>Under a consideration of the hurtful tendency of reading plays, romances, novels, and other pernicious books, it is earnestly recommended to every member of our society to discourage and suppress the same. And friends are desired to be careful of the choice of all books, in which their children read, seeing there are many under the specious titles of religion and morality, containing sentiments repugnant to the truth, as it is in Christ Jesus. 1764.</P>

<P>It is advised that in answering our eleventh query, where there appear any come to or gone from any monthly-meeting, the name of the meeting such came from, or are gone to, be mentioned in the answer; and in order for an early care to send forward certificates, all friends who may be acquainted with any such case or cases, are desired to give notice thereof, to the first monthly-meeting to which they belong, after such knowledge; and the meeting are desired to pay a careful attention to their duty in such cases, either by sending certificates, or labouring with their members as our disci∣pline requires.</P>

<HEAD>CHILDREN.</HEAD>
<P>INASMUCH as we have a large body of youth growing up, the off∣spring of friends, these call for our special care and concern, that they may be preserved in the way of truth, in which our forefathers walked; and in order thereto, we tenderly recommend to all parents and guardians, first, that they take heed to themselves, that their own spirits be rightly seasoned and directed, for the help and good government of their children; and then, that they have a constant watchful eye in love over them for their good, and keep them as much as possible within their notice and observation; for this we are sensible of, that the miscarriages of youth have very much proceeded from their being imprudently indulged or left to themselves, by which means they become exposed to the danger of evil examples on the one hand, and vicious corrupt principles on the other, with which the world too much abounds; and therefore we earnestly and tenderly advise all parents and guardians to be watchfully concerned in this respect, and that they take all proper occa∣sions, both by example and instruction, to help their children; and that mothers of children as well as fathers, as they have frequently the best op∣portunities, would take particular care to instruct them in the knowledge of religion, and the Holy Scriptures; because it has been found by experience that good impressions early made on the tender minds of children, have proved lasting means of preserving them in a religious life and conversation. This practice was enjoined strongly upon the people of Israel by Moses and Joshua, the servants of the Lord, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> required them to read or repeat the law to their children; and the apostle Paul takes notice of Timothy's being well instructed in the Holy Scriptures from a child, and of the unfeigned faith
<PB N="14" REF="019014_0021_0FA958DAE5C207E8"/>which dwelt in his grand-mother Lois, and his mother Eunice, 2 Tim. i. 5, who no doubt had a religious care of his education.</P>
<P>But when parents or guardians are deficient in such their care, we recom∣mend to monthly-meetings, that they stir them up thereto, either by visiting them in their families, or in such manner as in the wisdom of God they may see meet; that so the doctrines of the gospel, and a conversation agreeable thereunto, may be maintained unto all generations. 1732.</P>
<P>It is the sense and judgment of this meeting, that children of such parents as are married among friends shall be looked upon as members, and the children of such parents as become members by request, and are born after∣wards, shall likewise be looked upon as members, as also their children born before, if their parents apply on their behalf, and the monthly-meeting think they are suitable; and that where but one of the parents is a member, either father or mother, become so by application or otherwise, their children shall not be looked upon as members, unless their father or mother professing with us make application to the monthly-meeting on account of their children; and then the monthly-meeting judge whether such children be suitable to be admitted as members or not.</P>
<P>And it is advised that where but one of the parents are members of our society, that they endeavour to bring up their children agreeable to truth as far as is in their power, and when they think it suitable for them to be mem∣bers, not to neglect asking the care of friends in their behalf. 1774.</P>

<HEAD>CIVIL GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>IT is our principle, and hath ever been our practice, to be subject to what∣soever government is set over us, either by doing or suffering. 1660, renewed in 1782.</P>
<P>This is our principle, and hath ever been our practice, to obey authority by doing or suffering, not disputing whether the authority in itself be absolutely of God or not, yet being an authority over us, we are to obey it either by doing or suffering, because it is an authority. 1661, renewed 1782.</P>
<P>Advised to walk wisely and circumspectly towards all men, in the peace∣able spirit of Christ Jesus, giving no offence or occasions to those in outward government, nor way to any controversies, heats, and distractions of this world, about the kingdoms of it; but to pray for the good of all, and submit all to that divine power and wisdom, which rule over the kingdoms of men. 1689.</P>
<P>This meeting was well satisfied, and very glad of the sense they had of the innocency and peaceableness of the body of friends in general towards the civil government under which we live, and enjoy our present liberty in the peaceable exercise of our tender consciences towards Almighty God, to whom we are humbly thankful for the same, being obliged to demean our∣selves not only as grateful people, but as a Christian society, to live peaceably and innoffensively under the present government, as we have always done under the various revolutions of government, ever since we were a people, according to our ancient Christian principle and practice; in which we hope we shall ever persevere, according as we are enjoined by our peaceable Saviour Jesus Christ, and the Christian advice of his faithful servants and ministers among us: We being a people clear, in the sight of God, from all evil de∣signs,
<PB N="16" REF="019014_0023_0FA958DC7A96CB68"/>plots, and conspiracies whatsoever, and hope we shall continue a people always quiet in the land, having nothing but love and good-will to all men.</P>
<P>Persuaded this our ancient Christian testimony, publicl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> owned among us, none can gainsay, nor any faithful friends can ever decline, being assured, that the Lord will, in his own due time, remove all offences and causeless jealousies and reproaches, tending to cloud our innocency, and will set his own power and the peaceable kingdom of his dear Son over all. 1692.</P>
<P>We cannot for conscience sake actively comply with some things enjoined by human laws, yet the principles we profess, as well as the Holy Scriptures, require that we should "render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's," and be punctual in the payment of every tribute, which we can justly do, with∣out acting in opposition to that sacred illumination bestowed upon us by the Father of Lights, not only to teach, but also to enable us to perform every duty with uprightness and integrity, both to God, and to those who, in the course of his providence, are placed in authority. 1757.</P>
<P>For the preservation of our fellow members, it appears necessary for this meeting to issue forth the following advices, viz.</P>
<P>That they strictly adhere to our long professed and invariable principle, against being concerned in pulling down and setting up, or bringing about revolutions in outward government, by outward force, human policy or con∣trivance; and also that they be not deceived with the flattering prospect of being cloathed with secular authority, either legislative, judicial or executive, knowing these things have a tendency rather to brace the mind with pride, and expose to various temptations, than to humble the creature; therefore shun temptation, seek humility, the way to be cloathed with authority in the truth, and be contented with the honour and dignity thereof. 1782.</P>
<P>It is our sense and judgment that no friend can, consistent with our Christian testimony, run, or make, or countenance on his behalf to be made, any short entries of goods, wares or merchandize, imported, on which the government have laid any impost, duties or excise; but that a true and honest manifest thereof be exhibited to the proper office for receiving the same; and if there
<PB N="17" REF="019014_0024_0FA958DD32D588D8"/>should be any who have a conscientious scruple against the payment of such impost, duties or excise, which may now or hereafter be required, they acquaint the officer or he government therewith, who we doubt not will be tender in that respect; as we, as a people, mean to be subject to the laws passively, where our consciences restrain from active compliance therewith.</P>
<P>And if any of our members should act inconsistently herewith, or should buy or vend any goods, knowing them to be run or short entered, that monthly-meetings deal with such as disorderly walkers.</P>

<HEAD>CONDUCT and CONVERSATION.</HEAD>
<P>WE earnestly beseech all friends, and the youth especially, to avoid all such conversation as tends to draw out their minds into the foolish and wicked pastimes with which this age abounds; particularly balls, gam∣ing-places, horse-races and play-houses, those nurseries of debauchery and wickedness, the burthen and grief of the sober part of other societies, as well as of our own, practices wholly unbecoming a people under the Christian profession, &amp;c.</P>
<P>And where any professing with us are found transgressing this advice, or are in the practice of any immoralities, or other reproachful conduct, that the monthly-meeting where such transgressors belong deal with them.</P>
<P>It is earnestly recommended to all friends, resorting to our annual or other public assemblies, to be very careful at their inns, or other places where they may lodge or converse, to be prudent in all manner of behaviour, both in public and private; avoiding all intemperance in eating and drinking, and likewise foolish jesting, or any undue liberty whatsoever; that our conversa∣tion, seasoned with the fear of God, may appear correspondent to our pro∣fession, and answer the witness of God in others. 1739.</P>
<P>It is the sense of this meeting, that chewing tobacco, and taking of snuff, unnecessary going out of our religious meetings, laughing and other indecent behaviour therein, and frequent or unnecessary conversation at the breaking up thereof, are practices inconsistent with Christian gravity, and unbecoming the solemnity of the occasion; and friends are desired to labour to suppress the same, and where any, contrary to the Christian advices of their brethren or sisters, continue therein, it i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> recommended to the meetings they belong to, to deal with them as with those who refuse the advice of their friends.</P>

<P>WE esteem it very necessary and requisite, that young convinced and well inclined persons be early visited in the love of God, by faithful friends, for their encouragement, help, and furtherance in truth. 1710.</P>
<P>We earnestly entreat that an holy care may rest upon all professors of truth, to walk circumspectly as good examples; that in a particular manner the ministers and elders may carefully watch that their conduct may be to the edification and strength of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, though sometimes weak, enquirers. 1753.</P>
<P>Agreed, for initiating convinced persons into membership amongst friends, That they first apply to a preparative-meeting, and in person request to come under the care of friends: If the preparative-meeting approve the same, that they acquaint the monthly-meeting thereof, and the person so requesting to attend at that time, and signify his or her desire to be taken under their care; whereupon the monthly-meeting shall appoint some suitable friends to enquire into the person's life and conversation, and also to take a solid opportunity of conference with the petitioner, in order the better to under∣stand whether their motives for such request be sincere, and from the bottom of true conviction, and make report of their suitableness to become members accordingly; which, if satisfactory to the meeting, that a minute be then made thereon, signifying their accepting such a person into membership with us.</P>

<HEAD>COVETOUSNESS.</HEAD>
<P>LET none strive nor covet to be rich in this world, in these changeable things that will pass away; but let your faith stand in the Lord God, who changes not, that created all, and gives the increase of all. 1676.</P>
<P>We do, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, warn and charge all that profess the truth amongst us, to take heed and beware of covetousness, over∣reaching, oppressing and defrauding of any, from whence strife, contention and law-suits, do often arise; and if any difference about these things do happen among you, to stop and suppress it. 1697.</P>
<P>As our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ exhorted and warned to take heed and beware of covetousness, which is idolatry, we are concerned that all professing Christianity among us may take heed of pride, covetousness, and hastening to be rich in the world, which are pernicious and growing evils; let them be watched against, resisted and suppressed, in the fear and dread of Almighty God, and have no place or countenance in his camp. O ye grave elders, both men and women! be careful and watchful against these evils, and over the youth in these cases. 1720.</P>
<P>We beseech you to stand upon your guard against the allurements and temptation of this evil world; and beware of an ambitious and covetous spirit, by which many are ensnared in too eager a pursuit of earthly enjoy∣ments; the danger of which is thus described by the apostle Paul: "They that will be rich, fall into temptation and a snare; and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in destruction and perdition: For the love of money is the root of all evil, which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows."</P>
<P>Beware therefore, dearly beloved, lest you also, being led aside by the love of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, fall from your own sted∣fastness. 1740.</P>

<HEAD>DAYS and TIMES.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED that friends keep to their wonted example and testimony, against the superstitious observation of days. 1691.</P>
<P>That all friends be careful, on occasion of general fast-days, feast-days, (called thanksgivings) and also on occasion of fast-days (pretended humilia∣tions) not to imitate the common custom of refraining from their labour, in husbandry or otherwise, but proceed with their business as it falls in course, as if it were another day, and not in contempt, or only in opposition, but in humility; and that friends do no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shut their shop-doors or windows, or any part of them, but endeavour as much as possible with conveniency, accord∣ing to the ancient testimony of friends, to keep them open upon such occa∣sions; and also in all other things wherein truth's testimony is or may be concerned, that friends come up clearly, and not flinch or baulk their testi∣mony. 1709.</P>
<P>That all friends keep to the simplicity of truth, and our ancient testimony, in calling and writing the months and days by scripture names (that is nume∣rical) and not by heathen. 1697.</P>
<P>And that you may the more clearly discern the importance of that Christian testimony borne by our predecessors in this case, we recommend what follows to your serious consideration, viz.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="missing" EXTENT="1 page" DISP="〈1 page missing〉"/>
<PB N="29" REF="019014_0030_0FA958E65F6B5D90"/>bable, that the method of distinguishing the months by their numerical order only was the most ancient as it is the most plain, simple and rational.</P>
<P>As the idolatrous Romans thus gave names to several of the months in honour of their pretended deitics; so the like idolatry prevailing among our Saxon ancestors, induced them to call the days of the week by the name of the idol which on that day they peculiarly worshipped. Hence the First day of the week was by them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> led Sunday, from their accustom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y adoration of the sun upon that day.</P>
<P>The Second day of the we<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> they called Monday, from their usual custom of worshipping the moon on that day.</P>
<P>The Third day of the week they named Tuesday, in honour of one of their idols called Tuisco.</P>
<P>The Fourth day of the week they called Wednesday, from the appellation of Woden, another of their idols.</P>
<P>The Fifth day of the week was called Thursday, from the name of an idol called Thor, to whom they paid their devotions on that day.</P>
<P>The Sixth day of the week was termed Friday, from the name of Friga, an imaginary goddess by them worshipped.</P>
<P>The Seventh day of the week they stiled Saturday, as is supposed from Saturn, or Seater, by them then worshipped<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Verstegan and Sheringham.</NOTE></P>
<P>In the ages of Popish superstition, not only the use of such heathenish names and customs was indulged, but also other unsound and unscriptural practices in religion were invented and introduced. For when the profession of the Christian religion became national, multitudes of the heathen priests, whose interest lay in the performance of rites, ceremonies, and sacrifices, em∣braced prevailing Christianity with selfish views, and laboured early, with too much success, to find employment for themselves, by imposing on the peo∣ple a new set of ceremonies and sacrifices, bearing some resemblance to those, which in their former state of heathenism they had been accustomed to. From this corrupt source sprang the Popish sacrifice of the mass, the celebration of which, at particular times, and on particular occasion <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> rise to the vulgar names of Michaelmas, Martinmas, Christmas, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ik.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="019014_0031_0FA958E6D0B315E0"/>
Seeing therefore that these appellations and names of days, months, and times, are of an idolatrous or superstitious original, contrary to the divine command, the practice of good and holy men in former ages, and repugnant to the Christian testimony borne by our faithful friends and predecessors in the truth, for the sake of which they patiently endured many revillings; let neither the reproach of singularity, nor the specious reasonings of such as would evade the cross of Christ, turn you aside from the simplicity of the gospel, nor discourage you from keeping to the language of truth, in denominating the months and days according to the plain and scriptural way of expression, thereby following the example of our worthy elders, and com∣ing up in a noble and honourable testimony against these, and all other remains of idolatry and superstition.</P>

<HEAD>DEFAMATION and DETRACTION.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED to watch against all tale-bearing and defaming friends or others, or evil-speaking tending thereunto; and shut out all occasions of offences, contentions and divisions, and to put a speedy stop thereto, passing righteous judgment upon all, who appear instruments of divisions and offences, contrary to that peaceable truth and gospel we profess to be guided by. Be kind and tender-hearted one to another, earnestly labouring for universal love, union, and peace in our religious society.</P>
<P>But when any hath received offence from another; let him first speak privately to the party offending, and endeavour reconciliation between themselves, and not to whispher, or aggravate matters against one another, behind their backs, to the making parties, and the breach wider. 1692.</P>
<P>Let those just and ancient commands of God be observed, Levit. xix. 16, "Thou shalt not go up and down as a tale-bearer among thy people;" and Exodus xxiii. 1, "Thou shalt not raise a false report." In the fear of the Lord stand against all whisperers, backbiters, tale-bearers, defamers and slanderers, and against all whisperings, backbitings, tale-bearing, reproaching, and slander∣ing, and put a speedy stop thereto as much as in you lies, for such works of dark∣ness and envy tend to division and discord, and the righteous law of God goes against both the authors, fomenters, receivers and encouragers thereof. 1695.</P>
<P>Be careful to avoid all backbitings, whisperings, and tale-bearings; for "The words of a tale-bearer," says the wise man, "are as wounds," Prov. xviii. 8, tending to the defamation and lessening the characters one of ano∣ther. Be not therefore like those of whom the prophet complains, "Report, say they, and we will report;" but when you hear a thing tending to the defamation of any, enquire of the reporter, whether he has acquainted the
<PB N="32" REF="019014_0033_0FA958E85C90AAF8"/>person affected thereby with such a report; if not, caution him to forbear spreading the same, lest the reputation of the innocent be injured thereby. Endeavour to put a speedy stop to all such wicked practices, and works of dark∣ness, justly condemnable, not only in the authors, but the encouragers thereof. "He that worketh deceit," says the Royal Psalmist, <Q>shall not dwell within my house; he that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight,</Q> Psal. ci. 5, 7. 1738.</P>
<P>We remind you to stand upon your guard against all whispering, backbiting and detracting spirits, who busy themselves in spreading evil surmisings one of another, and to discourage every practice of that nature, observing the ad∣vice of the apostle, <Q>Let all bitterness, wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil-speaking, be put away from you, with all malice; be ye kind one to another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you,</Q> Eph. iv. 31, 32. Always mindful of the precept of our Lord, <Q>Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them,</Q> Mat. viii. 12. 1748.</P>
<P>And in order to put a stop to all tale-bearing and slandering, friends would do well to manifest their aversion to such a practice. <Q>The north wind, says Solomon, driveth away rain; so doth an angry countenance a backbiting tongue,</Q> Prov. xxv. 23. 1733.</P>
<P>It is the advice of this meeting, that any person charged with defamation or scandal, ought to be proceeded against in the manner and by the several steps following: First, the person defamed, or supposed to be defamed, in his own person, or any other to whom the knowledge of the case shall come, to go to the accused and tell him his fault, or supposed fault, between them alone, and by the best method he is capable of to labour to convince him of it, in order to his acknowledgment of the truth and repentance, if he appears to be guilty. But if the accused shall appear, either through ignorance not to apprehend the validity of the proof, or through wilfulness not to yield to it, or being convinced, shall refuse to make such satisfaction as the nature of case
<PB N="33" REF="019014_0034_0FA958E9D2105808"/>requires (that being the consequence of true repentance) in such case the accuser to take with him one or two more of the monthly-meeting the accused belongs to, if it may be conveniently done, and if the accused thinks fit, he may bring with him one or two friends also of the same monthly-meeting, if it may be conveniently done; and they together, in the wisdom of God, to endeavour to obtain the true knowledge of the case, by hearing witnesses, if there be occasion. And if they all judge him guilty, and he doth not make satisfaction; or if they do not all agree that he is innocent; in either of these cases happening, the person charging is at liberty to bring the matter before the church, who are the only judges now remaining, both of the nature of the fact, and the validity of the proof of it; and they, in the wisdom of God, which we hope will not be wanting to his church, as they humbly wait on him for it, to deal with him for the good ends before mentioned, and as they see cause, upon a mature and deliberate consideration, to justify or condemn him. And if the church shall see meet to commit the consideration of a case of this nature, for better dispatch, to certain persons of their own body, we recom∣mend it as our tender advice, in case the accused shall object against one or more of the friends so chosen, that the church have a due regard to such objection, and set aside the person or persons so objected against, and substi∣tute another or others in his or their room, provided such objection doth not extend to the major part of the friends so chosen; and in general we desire all tenderness and regard may be had to a person under such circumstances; and that friends, in a spirit of love and condescension, should be ready to make him as easy as they can, provided they keep up the authority of their meetings.</P>
<P>Nameless books, pamphlets, and papers, reflecting darkly on friends, are testified against; and it is desired that no such book, pamphlet or paper, be written, printed, published, or privately handed about, by any under our profession, for the time to come. 1718.</P>
<P>If you hear a report of a friend (to his disadvantage) be careful not to report it again, but go to the person of whom the report is, and enquire if it
<PB N="34" REF="019014_0035_0FA958EA8A9CFAE0"/>be true; then deal with such a person for it, according to the doctrine of Christ, Mat. xviii. 16, 17; but if false, then endeavour as much as in you lies to stop such report: For, as Solomon says, <Q>A good name is rather to be chosen than great riches,</Q> Prov. xxii. 1. 1719.</P>
<P>Whereas it may happen, that some friends may suffer much in their repu∣tation and character, by a detracting spirit, which too much prevails among some bearing our name, who shelter themselves under a pretence that they say no more than they have heard from others, but will not discover who they are; wherefore, to prevent this evil of reporting and tale-bearing, it is agreed, that such reporters or tale-bearers shall either discover their authors, or be dealt with, and testified against, as the authors thereof. 1744.</P>

<HEAD>DIFFERENCES and DISPUTES.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED that friends be tender to the principle of God in all, and shun the occasion of vain disputes and janglings, both amongst them∣selves and others; for this many times is like a blustering wind, that hurts and bruises the tender buds of plants. 1676.</P>
<P>Seeing our comfort, as a people, depends upon our care to maintain peace and fellowship amongst brethren, in all our services, we earnestly recommend an humble and condescending frame of spirit unto all; that with godly fear, wisdom and meekness, we may be so ordered in all our respective services, that every high and rough thing may be laid low, that all occasions of striving may be prevented, and the peace of the church of Christ preserved and increased amongst us.</P>
<P>And to this purpose it is tenderly advised, that we diligently and carefully observe the comely and blessed gospel order, so long known and in practice amongst us, in the spirit of meekness and of a sound mind, which is the way to crush all differences in their infancy, and suppress the rise as well as stop the progress of every thing that is unseemly, and inconsistent with the testi∣mony of the precious truth. 1699.</P>
<P>Advised that a spirit of love and humility may more and more diffuse itself among us, and influence the hearts of all, so that every one may come to seek peace and pursue it; and that none be apt to take offence; but each, in his own particular, be more careful to rectify his own failings and imper∣fections, than curious in observing, censuring and aggravating, those of others. This will lead to the exercise of mutual forbearance and forgiveness one of another, by which the occasions of contention will be avoided, and the church preserved in a state of peace and tranquility. 1736.</P>

<HEAD>DISCIPLINE, AND MEETINGS for DISCIPLINE.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED that the church's testimony and judgments against disorderly and scandalous walkers, as also the repentance and condemnation of the parties restored, be recorded in a distinct book in the respective monthly and quarterly-meetings, for the clearing of truth, friends, and our holy profes∣sion; to be produced and published by friends for that end and purpose, so far only as in God's heavenly wisdom they shall see needful.</P>
<P>And it is also our advice in the love of God, that after any friend's repent∣ance and restoration, he abiding faithful in the truth that condemns the evil, none among you so remember his transgression, as to cast it at him, or upbraid him with it; for that is not according to the mercies of God. 1675.</P>
<P>Earnestly recommended, whatever your places and stations in the church may be, that in the most weighty and serious manner you often call to remembrance, in all humility of mind, what it was that brought us to be a people; and what is and will be that which will preserve us such: That the foundation on which a true Christian is built, is the spirit of Christ; let this therefore direct you in all things, both respecting your private conversation, and whatever you do for God in his church: This is the only true means to preserve you holy and blameless in the one, as well as serviceable and useful in the other; in this every one will have a single regard to the service that comes before him, in monthly and quarterly-meetings, without partiality or respect of persons.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="019014_0038_0FA958F04DF41CF0"/>
<Q>Hear the causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him: Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but you shall hear the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l, as well as the great: You shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's,</Q> Deut. i. 16, 17. And in the management of such affairs, they will find their own spirits rightly seasoned and prepared for every work and service to which they may be called; and all disorderly proceedings, arising from the heat of our own spirits, will thereby be shut out; and thus the church will be preserved, on her ancient, solid, and permanent foundation, to the glory of God, and her own quiet and comfort. 1726.</P>
<P>And in order for the regular and easy proceeding in the service and dis∣cipline of the church, meetings have been by divine assistance, as above hint∣ed, set up and established, serviceable and subordinate one unto another as preparative, consisting of friends belonging to one or more meetings particu∣lar for worship: Monthly, consisting of as many preparatives as may most usefully compose the same: Quarterly, to consist of as many monthly-meetings as are thought useful to constitute the same, to meet together once in three months: Yearly, consisting of all the quarterly-meetings in New-England, to meet annually the fifth day before the second sixth day, in the sixth month, on Rhode-Island, for a great and weighty oversight and Christian care of the affairs of the churches, pertaining to our holy profession and Christian communion; that good order, true love, unity and concord, may be faithfully followed and maintained among all of us as a peculiar people, called and chosen out of the world, and the errors and corruptions thereof. And as it hath been experienced, that in those meetings great comfort and satisfaction have been received and enjoyed, when the members have attended them in awe, humility and love, with no other views but the service of God, and the help and assistance one of another; this meeting doth therefore, in brotherly love, exhort all friends carefully to gather in uprightness and single∣ness of heart, suitable to our calling, and the dignity of that power, that as we behave wisely and meekly, will preside and govern in all our meetings:
<PB N="39" REF="019014_0039_0FA958F08CB99D38"/>This will divest us of partiality and stiffness of opinion, and all high thoughts of ourselves, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in us patience and condescension, according to that excellent admonition of our blessed Lord, that he that is greatest amongst you be your servant.</P>
<P>Agreed that no quarterly-meeting be set up divided into two, or discon∣tinued, but by the yearly-meeting; no monthly-meeting, but by the quar∣terly; no preparative or meeting of worship, but by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> monthly-meeting, which is the lowest meeting that has the right of disowning members. These meetings are to continue subordinate and accountable thus: The preparative to the monthly, the monthy to the quarterly, and the quarterly to the yearly-meeting; so that if at any time the yearly-meeting be dissatisfied with the proceedings of any of the said meetings, or the quarterly-meeting with the proceedings of any of the monthly-meetings, or the monthly-meeting with the proceedings of any of the preparative-meetings within its limits, such meet∣ings ought with readiness and meekness to render a satisfactory account ac∣cordingly; and that our records be open to any of our meetings, particular members, and to such others as the respective monthly-meetings may think necessary, for the ascertaining of marriages, births or other rights.</P>
<P>That each monthly-meeting choose two or more sober and judicious men friends, and two or more women friends, to be overseers in each preparative-meeting, which overseers are to render account of their service to the month∣ly-meeting at least once a quarter, and to be annually appointed or re-chosen.</P>

<P>Let a necessary enquiry be raised in the minds of all members of the church, who have had any part of the Lord's work upon them, how they have acquitted themselves therein, and discharged themselves in the sight of God; forasmuch as a day comes on apace, in which an account of our stew∣ardship will be required at our hands. The discipline of the society, in some places at a low ebb, would again be revived and strengthened, if this awful sense of rendering an account of our trust, and the importance of being clear from the blood of all men, were enough impressed upon all minds. And, dear friends, as it is the Lord's work, let it be done as in his sight. Let all our answers to the queries be plain and explicit. Let a due sense of the state of the church prevail on your minds, rather than an unwillingness to appear deficient among your brethren. May a suitable engagement of mind prevail on all the active members of the church to acquit themselves with faithfulness, that they may at last receive the crown of righteousness, which will never fade away. 1760.</P>

<HEAD>EDUCATION.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED that friends who are of ability, and have the prosperity of truth at heart, would in the education of their children take care, as suitable opportunities and occasions may offer, to let them be instructed in some modern tongues, as French, High and Low Dutch, Danish, &amp;c. that so when they are grown up, as it shall please the Lord to dispose and incline them, they may be of service to the church. 1737.</P>
<P>As the right education of children, and the nurture of youth, is of very great consequence to them, and to the succeeding generation, we pressingly exhort all parents, and heads of families, to procure such useful learning for their children, as their abilities will admit; and to encourage them, as well by example as precept, to the frequent reading of the Holy Scriptures; and that they begin, as early as possible, to instil into their tender minds the prin∣ciples of truth and virtue; and instruct them in the nature and necessity of being born from above, without which, our Lord declared, no man shall see the kingdom of God; and, in order hereunto, that they labour to bring them acquainted with the holy seed, which is sown by the divine hand in every heart for that gracious end; that they may, through the Lord's blessing of such pious and paternal endeavours, be induced to place their affections upon it, and cleaving thereto in faithful obedience, come to experience it to be unto them Christ within the hope of their glory.</P>
<P>The importance of an early instruction in the law of God, is set forth with peculiar strength, clearness, and solemnity, in Deut. vi. 4, &amp;c. <Q>Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart,
<PB N="44" REF="019014_0043_0FA958F44FFDD388"/>and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.</Q> It is requisite also that restraint be added to instruction, it being much easier, as well as more prudent, to be exercised upon the first appearances of an inclination to danger∣ous or hurtful liberties, than afterwards; for where children, through the prevalence of fond affection, have been accustomed to improper indulgences, when they are grown to such a dangerous degree of ripeness, that the exertion of authority hath become absolutely necessary, the strength of their passions so habituated hath often proved unconquerable, or very difficult to overcome, to the great hurt of the unhappy youth, and the unspeakable grief of the im∣prudently indulgent parents. 1760.</P>

<HEAD>FAMILIES.</HEAD>
<P>FORASMUCH as a godly care is growing among friends in many places, that all things which are unsavoury and hurtful may be removed, so that all who profess the precious truth with us, may come up together in the good order of the gospel, for the furthering of which, and encouraging thereto, it is recommended that weighty and sensible friends, of unblameable conversations, be chosen in the wisdom of God to visit the families of friends in his love; and they are desired to advise and admonish, in the peaceable spirit of truth, as occasion may offer. 1708.</P>
<P>And we beseech you, brethren, let the tender advice of such as shall under∣take so brotherly an office, meet with a kind and open reception, that in the mutual giving and receiving of wholesome counsel and advice, you may co∣operate to the help and furtherance of each other's faith, and the reviving our ancient Christian testimony. 1752.</P>
<P>Let the Christian duty of visiting the sick be timely remembered and prac∣tised, it having often left comfort, ease and sweetness, upon the spirits of many to their very end. 1710.</P>
<P>A weighty concern being livingly impressed on our minds in this meet∣ing, that good service may arise from visiting the families of our brethren, by rightly concerned friends, we are engaged to recommend it to the sensi∣ble members of the body, and to monthly and quarterly-meetings, to feel deeply after the pointings of truth; and that as this divine principle opens their way, they may promote this useful service in their respective meetings, by appointing suitable friends, of either or both sexes, who are desired to proceed therein in the love of the gospel, and under the tendering influence thereof; which we have good cause to hope may thus be attended with beneficial effects to the visited, and with solid satisfaction, and additional experience in the work of truth, to those who may be engaged therein. 1773.</P>

<HEAD>GRAVE-STONES.</HEAD>
<P>THIS meeting being informed, that friends in some places have gone into the vain and empty custom of erecting monuments over the dead bodies of friends, by stones, inscriptions, tomb-stones, &amp;c. and being very desirous friends should keep a commendable plainness and simplicity in this, as well as other respects; it is therefore the advice of this meeting, that all such monuments as are already in being over dead bodies of friends, should be removed, as much as may be with discretion and conveniency; and that none be any where made or set up, near or over the dead bodies of friends or others, in friends burying-places, for time to come. 1717.</P>
<P>And whereas at some burials, when people come from far, there may be occasion of some refreshment, yet it is advised that it be done with modera∣tion, avoiding that indecent and unbecoming practice of using spirituous liquors; and that the behaviour of all friends be with such gravity and sobriety as becomes the occasion; and if any appear otherwise, let such be reproved and dealt with as the case may require.</P>
<P>And it is advised that friends carefully keep to the time appointed for burials, and not wait for such as may come unseasonably. And that none erect grave nor tomb-stones. But it is recommended to friends, as much as may be, to get into the practice of burying our dead in rows; grown people by themselves, and children by themselves, without any distinction of families or relatives.</P>
<P>And in order that burials be commendably and decently accomplished, agreeable to the above directions, as well as for the assistance of those imme∣diately concerned, monthly-meetings are advised to appoint some solid friends to attend thereat.</P>

<HEAD>LAW.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS some persons, professing with us, have proved so base and unworthy, as when they have run themselves into debt, to remove themselves, or their effects, to prevent justice; whereby those creditors, who are friends, have been deprived of an opportunity of the common method of friends, specified in the minute of 1697, respecting arbitrations; it is hereby declared, that the last paragraph of said minute, which prohibits friends to sue or arrest one another, is not intended to prevent such evil persons in those practices from being dealt with by a legal process, as the nature of the case may require: Of which circumstance the monthly and quarterly-meet∣ings are the proper judges; so it is not doubted but they will do justice to the parties concerned therein. And this meeting doth request every monthly-meeting to appoint and depute proper persons out of their several meetings, for such friends as have occasion to advise with, in the intervals of monthly-meetings, and, if they see cause, to give liberty to recover as above. 1720.</P>
<P>And as it may happen, that by sudden losses, or unforeseen accidents, or otherwise, a friend may be reduced, and unable to pay all just debts, and his creditors falling suddenly upon him by suits or attachments, foreclose a due proportion of a just debt due to a friend, if the advice specified in the minute of 1697 respecting arbitrations be strictly attended to; it is there∣fore to be understood, that, in all such sudden or extraordinary occasions, friends are left to their liberty to secure their just debts in a legal manner; provided they, in all cases, submit the attachment to come into a general average, upon a just settlement with all the other equitable demands, and to receive their dividends, according to their demands, with all the rest.</P>

<P>It is desired that such among friends as are endowed with plenty of outward substance, be timely and tenderly advised to do good therewith, in their day and generation, especially with regard to the poor; that the tokens of your charity may commend your memorial, and be good precedents to gene∣rations to come. 1696.</P>
<P>We find ourselves at this time engaged to request, that where provisions and the necessaries of life are dear and scarce, or sickness doth remarkably afflict, friends would in proportion to such scarcity and affliction exert their chari∣table assistance to the poor, which is our Christian duty, as stewards of the mercies wherewith the Lord has intrusted us. 1729.</P>
<P>"Let your moderation be known unto all men."

<HEAD>LOVE and UNITY.</HEAD>
<P>IT is our earnest desire, that, above all, friends hold fervent charity in the body; that will keep the members together in a blessed concord and communion, which is esteemed by the apostle the more excellent way, excel∣ling other gifts, which pass away; but charity, that is the love of God (from which our Christian and brotherly affection springs) shall endure forever: <Q>This envieth not, vaunteth not, boasteth not itself, and seeketh not its own; but is patient, beareth all things, suffereth all things, and watcheth not with an evil eye, no, nor thinketh ill, but is kind;</Q> in which blessed love, dear friends, hold your fellowship one with another, which was the character of the primitive Christians. 1705.</P>
<P>Among the gospel precepts, we find not any thing more strongly and frequently recommended by our Lord Jesus Christ and his apostles, to the primitive believers, than that they should love one another: And as we are sensible that nothing will contribute more to the peace and prosperity of the church than a due regard to this advice, so we earnestly desire that it may be the care and concern of all friends every where to dwell therein, and, in the unity of the Holy Spirit, to maintain love, concord and peace, in and among all the churches of Christ. 1730.</P>
<P>By accounts received, it appears that, in general, love and concord are maintained, and that friends in divers places are under an earnest concern for the promotion of peace, and for the suppressing and guarding against every occasion of strife and discord, tending to divide and scatter the flock of Christ: For strengthening this concern, and promoting this Christian disposition of love wheresoever it appears, we remind you of the benefits thereof, expressed in Psalm cxxxiii. <Q>Behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren
<PB N="60" REF="019014_0052_0FA9590049120968"/>to dwell together in unity! As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the mountains of Zion; for there the Lord commanded the blessing, even life for evermore.</Q> Be ye also mindful of the saying of our blessed Lord himself, John xiii. 35, <Q>By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.</Q> 1752.</P>

<HEAD>MARRIAGE.</HEAD>
<P>WE do exhort friends every where, that in the great concern of mar∣riage, whereon much of the comfort and happiness of life depend, they be mindful to proceed in the fear of the Lord, and have an eye to him for counsel and instruction in their choice; the neglect of which has been the ruin of many. 1734.</P>
<P>Parents, who have children to dispose of in marriage, are tenderly advised not to make it their first or chief care to obtain for them large portions or settlements of marriage; but rather be careful that their children be joined in marriage with persons of religious inclinations, suitable dispositions, temper, sobriety of manners, and diligence in business (which are things essentially necessary to a comfortable life in a married state) and carefully to guard against all mixt marriages, and unequal yoking of their children therein. 1722.</P>
<P>We being sensible of the hurt that may happen by persons under our pro∣fession drawing out the affections of one another, without the knowledge or con∣sent of parents or guardians, do, for preventing such mischief, deliver it as our sense and judgment, that in case any member of our society shall make application to any woman, being also a member, with intention or endeavours to entangle her affections, or make suit in order to marriage, without the privity and consent of her parents or guardians first had and obtained, or shall countenance or admit of such suit or application, whether such parents or guardians be friends or not; such persons ought not to be allowed or permit∣ted to proceed in any meeting of friends, in order to the accomplishing such intended marriage, until they shall have removed the offence, and given satis∣faction both to such parents or guardians, and to the meeting of friends where they belong, by an open and due acknowledgment of the offence, and con∣demnation
<PB N="64" REF="019014_0055_0FA959028A6C4238"/>of themselves therefor, and shall have obtained the consent of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> parents or guardians; unless it shall appear to the satisfaction of the month¦ly-meeting to which they belong, that such parents or guardians have not sufficient reason for withholding his, her or their consent, in which case the meeting, having due regard to the rights of parents and children, is to pro∣ceed therein as best wisdom may direct.</P>
<P>And it is further advised, that after parents and guardians have suffered their children to engage one another in affections, they do not break off up∣on any worldly account, but that they wait upon and seek the Lord for their children in proposals of marriage, before they give any encouragement there∣unto. 1707.</P>
<P>It is our sense and judgment, that it is inconsistent with the leadings of truth, for brothers children, sisters children, half brothers children, or half sisters children, to marry together, and for any to marry a first cousin's child, or any person nearer than a second cousin; and if any notwithstanding should proceed in marriage together, nearer than a second cousin, being previously cautioned and advised against it, that the monthly-meeting where such may belong give forth a public testimony against them, and not receive such into unity again, until such meetings are well assured that they have found a place of sincere repentance, and are received in the truth. 1772.</P>
<P>It is our sense and judgment, that no friend be allowed to marry with a deceased wife's sister, or deceased husband's brother: That friends be careful to give timely advice and admonition against such proceedings; and if any should be reluctant thereto, and proceed in marriage, that they be without delay testified against, and be not admitted to membership again in society, until friends be well assured that they are received in the truth. 1773.</P>
<P>And we do also, in the name of the Lord, advise and exhort all young and unmarried people among friends, that they do not make or admit any motion or procedure one with another, upon the account of marriage, without first acquainting their parents or guardians therewith, and duly waiting upon them for their consent and agreement therein. And we also advise, that, in the first
<PB N="65" REF="019014_0056_0FA959035FB9B828"/>place, all young persons concerned seriously wait upon the Lord for counsel and clearness in this weighty concern, before they make or admit any motion or procedure with any, in order to marriage; that the Lord may be in their eye, so as they may not be led by any forward, brittle, or uncertain affections, in this great concern, to their own hurt, grief of their friends, and dishonour of truth; and let it be the godly concern of both monthly and quarterly-meet∣ings to be careful and mindful of the preservation and good of children in this matter, as here proposed and signified, and not to omit giving due and faithful warnings and admonitions in this great and weighty concern. 1690.</P>
<P>We having considered what time shall be held to be too early for proposals of marriage, after the decease of former husband or wife; it is our sense and judgment, that it is not adviseable for any friend to make or admit of pro∣posals of marriage in less than twelve months. 1778.</P>
<P>The prudent and Christian care that has been maintained amongst us, in relation to marriage, ever since we were a people, having obtained a good report, it is become afresh the concern of this meeting, that the reputation of our religious society, and the cause of truth herein, may still be kept up; and that not only the several weighty advices of this meeting, in respect to the proceedings of the parties concerned, and the conduct of their parents and guardians, may be observed, but likewise that as little diversity as may be may appear amongst us in regard to the form and manner of solemnization.</P>
<P>In order therefore that the general practice of the society in respect to mar∣riage may be uniform, it is agreed, that the following directions be sent to the several quarterly-meetings, to be by them communicated to the monthly-meetings, as the rule of their proceedings, viz.</P>
<P N="1">1. The parties intending to join in marriage, having first notified their in∣tentions to the preparative-meeting, who are to notice the same to the succeed∣ing monthly-meeting as business, are to declare their intention to the month∣ly-meeting whereof they are members (when the business comes in course, both meetings of men and women appointing two suitable friends to attend the parties to each meeting, at which time orderly persons, not members, may be admitted to attend that part of the business by the consent of the meeting) in terms of the following import, viz.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="019014_0057_0FA9590432C62B40"/>
The man; <HI>That be intends to take</HI> A. B. <HI>to be his wife, if the Lord permit.</HI> The woman; <HI>That she intends to take</HI> B. C. <HI>to be her husband, if the Lord per∣mit.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. These declarations are to be made, first before the womens meeting, and then before the mens meeting. If they have parents or guardians pre∣sent, they are to declare their consent; if absent, a certificate or certificates are to be produced, signifying, <HI>that it is with their consent the parties do proceed to accomplish their intended marriage,</HI> previous to the declaration of the parties.</P>
<P>After which declaration, no objection appearing, the meeting is to acquaint them, that notice will be taken thereof, and that they may come to the next monthly-meeting for an answer. An entry is then to be made in both the mens and womens meeting, and two friends out of each to be appointed to enquire into the conversation and clearness of the parties; and if there are chil∣dren by a former marriage or marriages, to see that their rights are duly and legally secured, and to make report to the next monthly-meeting.</P>
<P>When, if no objection has appeared, the parties are to declare before the womens and mens meeting the <HI>continuance of their intention of marriage;</HI> and if nothing yet appears to obstruct, liberty is then to be granted them to solemnize the same, according to the good order used among us.</P>
<P>But if the parties are of different monthly-meetings, the man is first to propose the matter to the monthly-meeting to which he belongs, desiring their certificate, signifying his clearness to proceed in marriage with <HI>A. B.</HI> a member of monthly-meeting; whereupon the meeting are to appoint two friends to make enquiry therein, and to report to the next monthly-meeting; when, if nothing appears to prevent his having such certificate, he is to be recommended to the meeting to which the woman belongs, by a certificate, signifying his right of membership, clearness as aforesaid, and consent of parents or guardians, to be produced at the first monthly-meeting where he lays his intentions.</P>
<P>For solemnizing the marriage, a meeting may be appointed on some con∣venient week-day, as the elders and overseers of the marriage may think pro∣per,
<PB N="67" REF="019014_0058_0FA95904C93E0338"/>of which due notice is to be given; but unless some special circumstan∣ces make it necessary, it is advised to solemnize our marriages at the usual week-day meeting, at the meeting-house to which the woman belongs, unless leave hath been obtained of the monthly-meeting to solemnize the marriage in some other meeting-house, and the consent of that meeting likewise pro∣cured.</P>
<P>And it is earnestly recommended, that the consummation be performed decently, gravely and weightily; and in order thereto, and for the assistance of the parties immediately concerned, the monthly-meeting where the marriage is allowed is to appoint two judicious, grave and weighty men, and two such women friends, to attend the same, and to sit with the parties in the meeting for worship, and in a proper time, towards the conclusion of the meet∣ing, speak to the parties to proceed, who are then to stand up, and taking each other by the hand, declare in an audible and solemn manner to the fol∣lowing effect; the man first, viz. <HI>Friends, I take this my friend</HI> A. B. <HI>to be my wife, promising through divine assistance to be unto her a loving and faithful husband, until it shall please the Lord by death to separate us.</HI> And then the woman in like manner: <HI>Friends, I take this my friend</HI> C. D. <HI>to be my husband, pro∣mising through divine assistance to be unto him a loving and faithful wife, until it shall please the Lord by death to separate us.</HI></P>
<P>A certificate, in the following form of words, is then to be audibly read by some proper person, the express names and description of the parties being first inserted: They are then to sign the same the man first, the woman assuming the name of her husband; and such others present at the solemnity as are thought proper.</P>

<P>Agreed that it be recommended to the quarterly-meetings, that according to the ancient decent practices among friends, they take care that such men
<PB N="69" REF="019014_0060_0FA95907936C32D0"/>and women friends, as do make suit or concern themselves in proposals of marriage, one to the other, do not dwell in the same house, from the time they begin to be concerned, until their marriage is consummated. 1714.</P>
<P>In order to put a stop to an undue liberty in contracting marriages with such as are not of our society, it is advised, that all parents and guardians of children do take especial care, as much as in them lies, to prevent their children from running into such marriages; and that the friends of each particular meeting, as also of the monthly-meeting to which such persons belong, do in the wisdom and power of truth use their endeavours to put a stop to the said evil, by admonishing such as may attempt to marry as aforesaid to desist from accomplishing the same; but if they refuse to take counsel, or privately go to marry as aforesaid, that then such persons be dealt with according to the good order of truth, and judgment fixed upon all who take such undue liberty. 1719.</P>
<P>This meeting having deliberately considered the great exercise brought upon our society, by divers in profession with us, who contrary to our known principles, and the wholesome discipline established among us, are joined in marriage by the priest, with persons either of our own or other persuasions, do earnestly advise, that all friends use their utmost endeavours to prevent such marriages, whensoever the parties inclinations may come to their know∣ledge.</P>
<P>And it is the sense and judgment of this meeting, that where any do marry by the priest, or in any other manner, contrary to the established rules of the society, they shall be dealt with in a spirit of Christian love and tenderness, agreeable to our known discipline; and that, after the commission of such offence, their collection shall not be received, nor shall they be relieved in the manner of poor friends, nor be admitted to sit in meetings of discipline, until they are restored into unity with the monthly-meeting to which they belong.</P>
<P>And we earnestly advise all friends, that you watch diligently over one another for good, and that you deal in due time with such offenders, and all
<PB N="70" REF="019014_0061_0FA95907CBED2578"/>others that walk disorderly, endeavouring to reclaim and restore them by brotherly admonition and counsel; but where, after patient waiting, you find that your continued labour of love hath not its desired effect, that you neglect not to testify against and disown such persons; thereby preventing the reproach and dishonour which might be brought on our holy profession through their misconduct, and that the end and design of friends in settling a wholesome discipline among us may be answered. 1744, 1783. But as express direc∣tions cannot be given for each particular case that may arise, the several monthly-meetings are at liberty to judge how often such offenders are to be visited and dealt with, and in what manner they are to be proceeded against. Likewise monthly-meetings are to judge of the sincerity of such acknowledg∣ments as may be offered to them, and to accept or reject, as in true wisdom may seem meet. 1768.</P>
<P>This meeting being sorrowfully affected, under the consideration of the great exercise brought on friends by divers in our society entering into marriage with such as are not of our society, or, being in profession with us, are mar∣ried contrary to our established rules; to prevent which, many minutes directing dealing with such offenders have from time to time been made, but it doth not appear that said minutes extend to parents and guardians, that may be consenting to or encouraging such marriages; it is therefore the direction of this meeting, when that appears to be the case, that such parents or guardians, so offending, be dealt with in a spirit of Christian love and meek∣ness; and unless satisfaction be given to the monthly-meeting in which such circumstance may fall out, that a testimony do go forth for the clearing of truth against such offenders. 1752.</P>
<P>We also recommend the good order of friends relating to marriage, that it be carefully preserved and daily maintained in the first and earliest proceed∣ings leading thereunto, as well as the orderly solemnization thereof; and if any persons, contrary to the repeated advice and established order of friends, shall, under any pretence whatsoever, presume to take one another in any meeting for worship, without the consent of the monthly-meeting to which
<PB N="71" REF="019014_0062_0FA9590B2B159250" MS="y"/>they belong, such proceeding being of a clandestine nature, tending to make void the just care of friends in that case, we advise that the monthly-meeting do not fail to testify against the practice, as well as against the persons con∣cerned therein. 1730.</P>
<P>And as we have great cause to believe, that remissness in dealing, and weakness in some monthly-meetings in accepting superficial and insincere acknowledgments, have had a great tendency to promote such marriages, we earnestly advise, that monthly-meetings be very careful not to accept acknow∣ledgments without full satisfaction of the sincere repentance of such trans∣gressors, manifested by a conduct circumspect and consistent with our religious profession. 1783.</P>

<HEAD>Masters, Mistresses, and Servants.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED that servants professing the truth behave themselves in due subjection, humility and plainness, as becomes their profession and places: And likewise, that masters and mistresses behave themselves toward their servants according to the apostle's direction, Eph. vi. 5, 6, 9. Col. iv. 1. 1 Tim. vi. 1, 2. Titus ii. 9, 10. 1 Pet. ii. 18, 19, 20. 1703.</P>
<P>A religious care is recommended toward our servants, that all appearance of pride, idleness and vain conversation, in them may be discouraged; and that they may be exhorted to attend first and week-day meetings, and have a sense of God's love upon their spirits, and therein partake with us of the sweetness of truth; and in the discharge of their duty to God, and to their masters and mistresses, know peace in themselves. 1718.</P>
<P>And it is further advised, that all parents and masters of families do use their utmost care and endeavours to keep their youth duly to meetings, and to prevent the indecent straggling abroad of their children and servants, es∣pecially on the first days, and other times allowed them to attend meetings, and to keep them out of all tumultuous crouds or gatherings of rude people. 1726.</P>

<P>THIS meeting being under a weighty concern for friends who are or may be under sufferings and difficulties, on account of our religious testimony, do appoint a meeting for sufferings, consisting of twenty-five members, who are desired, with diligence, caution and due care, to proceed in such weighty matters as may come before them, humbly waiting for the influence of divine wisdom to direct their minds from time to time, so that their results may tend to their own peace, and welfare of our religious socie∣ty. They are desired to take cognizance of all grievances arising amongst us, wherein any friend or friends may be affected in his person or property, or in regard to our Christian testimony, to advise, counsel and assist, as best wisdom may direct; and any aggrieved friend or friends may apply to them, either in a collective or separate capacity, as the circumstance of the case may require.</P>

<HEAD>MEETINGS for WORSHIP.</HEAD>
<P>AS it hath been our care and practice from the beginning, that an open testimony for the Lord should be borne, and a public standard for truth and righteousness upheld in the power and spirit of God, by our open and known meetings, against the spirit of persecution, that in all ages hath sought to lay waste God's heritage; and as only through faithfulness, constancy and patience, victory hath been and is obtained; so it is our advice and judgment, that all friends gathered in the name of Jesus, keep up these public testimo∣nies in their respective places, and not decline, forsake or remove their public assemblies, because of times of sufferings, as worldly fearful and politic pro∣fessors have done, because of informers and the like persecutors; for such practices are not consistent with the nobility of the truth, and therefore not to be owned in the church of Christ. 1675.</P>
<P>Let every one be watchful against an earthly spirit, for that w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he good seed, and bring forth a slighting or neglecting your testimony in your first-day and week-day meetings, and bring a decay of your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>trength and zeal for God, and his truth, and bring a weakness upon you, by reason where∣of you will not be able to stand in an hour of temptation. 1689.</P>
<P>Agreed that frends, that live distant from meetings, be reminded to keep meetings in their families, to wait upon God, that their children and families may come to be seasoned in their spirits by the truth and the Lord's power, and that they may have his blessing upon their families. 1696.</P>
<P>Advised that all friends be careful to attend meetings for worship and business at the times and hours appointed, and not to detain meetings out of season. 1715.</P>
<P>Advised that friends keep their children to a constant, seasonable and or∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ly frequenting, as well of week day as of first-day meetings, instructing
<PB N="80" REF="019014_0067_0FA95D85C2CA5718"/>them to have their minds stayed in the divine gift, to wait upon the Lord therein, to receive a portion of his spiritual favour; that they, from the tender∣ing virtue of the Holy Spirit, may be engaged in heart and mind to walk worthy of so great grace, and in a holy zeal to honour God, submit to bear the cross, endure the shame, and become public witnesses for him amongst the sons of men. 1723.</P>
<P>And we earnestly exhort that you hold fast the profession of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, without wavering, both in respect to his outward coming in the flesh, his sufferings, death, resurrection, ascension, mediation and in∣tercession at the right hand of the Father; and to the inward manifestation of his grace and Holy Spirit in our hearts, powerfully working in the soul of man, to the subduing of every evil affection and lust, and to the purifying of our consciences from dead works, to serve the living God; that through the virtue and efficacy of this most holy faith, ye may become strong in the Lord, and in the power of his might, which will enable you to worship God in spirit with acceptance, and preserve you in a lively frame of mind, from a drowsy and lukewarm spirit, which in all our religious assemblies ought to be guarded against with the utmost care and circumspection. In this lively faith and pure life of Christ you will have victory over the world, over your desires after the grandeur and perishing things thereof, and over all corrupt customs and fashions, which are contrary to the purity of the gospel, and our ancient Christian testimony. 1736.</P>
<P>In all your religious meetings for the worship of Almighty God, let your minds be seasoned with an awful sense of real and true devotion, and be ye exemplary to the flock of Christ. Let the solemn gravity of your deport∣ment be such as may demonstrate to others, that you are in earnest in the great duty of waiting upon and worshipping God in spirit; that serious and tender-hearted enquirers may be encouraged to come and partake in your assemblies of that inward and spiritual consolation and refreshment, which the Lord is graciously pleased to impart to the souls of such as are humbled in his sight, and approach his holy presence with reverence and fear.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="019014_0068_0FA95D864B647D18"/>
Take care, we beseech you, in this day of ease and liberty, lest a spirit of lukewarmness and indifferency prevail over you, to the stopping up the streams of the water of life, and rendering you like the barren heath in the desert, which knoweth not when good comes. We entreat you to be especially watchful in this behalf, that an indolent and sluggish disposition appear not among you, to the stumbling of such serious enquirers as may attend our meetings, in expectation of that life and power, which the observation of your indifference and unconcernedness may give them too just cause to suspect that ye yourselves are strangers to. 1741.</P>
<P>Let not the smallness of your numbers discourage you from constantly attending those meetings, inasmuch as the words of Christ remain unchange∣ably true and stedfast, <Q>Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them,</Q> Mat. xviii. 20. But it hath been justly observed, that where remissness and neglect of attending meetings for worship have prevailed, it hath been too often an inlet to further declension, and such other undue liberties as truth and its guidance do by no means admit of. 1754.</P>
<P>We therefore tenderly exhort such as, through fear of neglecting their temporal concerns, or other considerations, are kept from a due attendance of these meetings, seriously to consider that gracious promise left upon record; <Q>Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and all these things shall be added unto you.</Q> Some of us have to testify, by blessed experience, that our outward affairs have not suffered, by giving up our time, the few hours set apart for religious worship; but, on the contrary, our minds have been thereby greatly strengthened to come up with propriety in the duties we owe to God, to our families, and to all mankind. 1758.</P>
<P>As it hath pleased divine goodness clearly to manifest amongst us the way of life and salvation, and to instruct us where and how to wait for him, prize, we beseech you, these precious privileges; keep all your meetings in the name of the Lord, and let your minds be established in an humble waiting upon him with reverence and fear; so shall strength be added to strength,
<PB N="82" REF="019014_0069_0FA95D870AE087D8"/>and being more closely united to him, you will experience the indwelling of his blessed Spirit. 1761.</P>
<P>When gathered in your religious assemblies, be truly concerned to retire to the divine and heavenly gift, which will minister to every state and condi∣tion, though you may have no outward teaching, and will direct you to wait, without being restless or uneasy, till it be a proper time to break up your meeting with that decency and solemnity which should attend our minds in such service; for want of which some forward spirits, who have been destitute of the right and true feeling of that spirit, in which such service should be performed, have broke up meetings in an unbecoming manner, to the sorrow and pain of mind of such as have been truly concerned for the good and prosperity of Zion [1755]: And be not apt, as the manner of some is, at the close of your meetings, hastily to enter into discourses about the affairs of this life, much less the vain amusements thereof; a practice inconsistent with the Christian gravity which at such time ought, in an especial manner, to season the minds of persons so lately assembled for the worship of God, in spirit and in truth. 1748.</P>
<P>Persons professing with us, who absent themselves from our religious meet∣ing, either on first or other days of the week, and disregard the repeated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ndeavours of friends to stir them up to this necessary duty, are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with by the monthly-meeting to which they belong, even to dif∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> requires it. 1770.</P>

<HEAD>Ministers and Elders, and Meeting of Ministers and Elders.</HEAD>
<P>IT is recommended that one or more faithful friend or friends, of either or both sexes, be appointed out of each particular meeting as standing elders by the monthly-meeting, whose duty is to help young ministers, and give advice to all others as occasion may require; to encourage our youth and others in virtue, and in a reverent and early attention to and belief in the divine appearance and operation of the spirit of Christ in their own hearts, and in a venerable esteem of the Holy Scriptures, and a frequent reading and meditating therein; and to that plainness, moderation and simplicity, which is becoming our holy profession; to stir up those who are or may be deficient in the due attendance of our meetings, and in general to watch over the flock of Christ; being themselves examples in faith, meekness and cha∣rity. 1709, 1728, 1760.</P>
<P>As these are officers of the church at large, let the monthly-meeting, after they have approved such as they adjudge duly anointed and qualified for that service, acquaint the quarterly-meeting therewith, who after solidly waiting for their concurring unity, and finding nothing to hinder, are to minute the same, and acquaint the select-meeting thereof; who are also to enter the appointment and concurrence on their minutes, and the friend so appointed may then sit in any of our meetings of ministers and elders. And informa∣tion of such appointments is to be given by the quarterly and select-meetings to their respective yearly-meetings, and their names when approved to be also entered on the yearly-meeting's record. And where any friend appearing in public ministry, whose conversation be clean and blameless, and the elders of the monthly-meeting he or she belongs to are convinced that the Lord hath
<PB N="84" REF="019014_0071_0FA95D89B72F9040" MS="y"/>called them to that weighty work, after duly waiting for due proof thereof, they signify their unity with his or her gift in the ministry to the monthly-meeting, who after weightily feeling after the mind of truth therein, and being united in approving him or her as a minister in the church, the same be enter∣ed and sent forward in like manner as in the case of elders.</P>
<P>The ministers and elders so approved, within the compass of each monthly-meeting (or where the quarterly-meeting should think best to unite the mem∣bers of two or more meetings in one) meet by themselves once in three months, and after solidly waiting to feel their minds seasoned with the virtue of truth, are to proceed to read and consider the queries, and how their pur∣port is answered by their members; tenderly advising and assisting one ano∣ther as the nature of the case may require; and form such answers to the queries as are agreeable to their states, which are to be signed by their clerk, and two or more friends are to be appointed as representatives, who are to take the answers, and assembling together previous to and at the place of hold∣ing the quarterly-meeting, do, with the assistance of other select members with∣in the compass of each quarter, compose a select quarterly-meeting, where the queries are again to be read, and the state of the meeting enquired into, and such advice and assistance afforded the lower meetings thereto belonging, by advice or committees, as occasion may require. And once a year preceding the yearly-meeting, general answers in writing to be drawn up and transmitted to the yearly select-meeting, by representatives to be appointed to attend the same; where the state of all the several quarters and their members are to be attended to, and such help afforded, and in such way and manner, as they in the wisdom of truth may think proper, in subordination to our Christian discipline; preserving records of their proceedings, and annually choosing or re-appointing a clerk, which the quarterly and monthly select-meetings are all advised to do.</P>
<P>And it is agreed that the quarterly select-meeting be held the day before each quarterly-meeting, at the same place, at the eleventh hour; and that the yearly select-meeting begin at Portsmouth the eleventh hour, on the day before the yearly-meeting.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="019014_0072_0FA95D8A4801CA18"/>
This meeting desires that you, whom the Lord hath gifted with a public testimony for his name and truth, may be careful to attend to the motions of truth, and in it be diligent to visit the heritage of God in their meetings, and especially those least frequented. 1695.</P>
<P>We farther entreat you, that in all your religious meetings, appointed for the worship of Almighty God, you wait in humble reverence for the influence of the word of life; be cautious not to move, in acts of devotion, in your own will; set not forward self to work, but patiently attend and wait for the gift and enlivening power of the Divine Spirit, without which your perform∣ances will be unacceptable, and like those of old, of which it was said, "Who hath required this at your hand?" Isaiah i. 12. 1742.</P>
<P>As we are fully persuaded, that the ministry of the gospel is not received of man, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ, according to that apostolical direction, <Q>As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God; if any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God giveth, that God in all things may be glorified:</Q> And as this ministry is divine, the motives and inducements thereunto are perfectly disinterested, and no way mercenary and lucrative, but concurrent to the precept Christ gave to his apostles, and immediate fol∣lowers, "Freely ye have received, freely give." 1771.</P>
<P>Friends, in their respective counties and meetings, are earnestly desired and advised to use prudence and caution, so as not to be imposed upon by cheats, or impostors, pretending to ministry or otherwise; and where there is a doubt or question concerning the ministry of any persons, in that case let such be called upon to shew what certificate they have; and in general it is recom∣mended to the monthly and quarterly-meetings, to see that friends who travel in the work of the ministry do go in the unity of the meetings to which they belong, and with certificates therefrom; and further, that it may become the tender care of the said meetings to watch over such as may be young in the ministry, to see that they walk humbly and wisely: That as on the one hand,
<PB N="86" REF="019014_0073_0FA95D8BFB10B658"/>nothing truly tending to the glory of God, and the edification of his church and people, may be discouraged, so on the other, where any thing appears which may make advice necessary, that the elders of the church, both ministers and others, do, in the wisdom of God, give their advice thereupon, with due regard to the state of weakness and childhood that such may be in. 1720.</P>
<P>And we do in much love caution those friends who are rightly concerned in the work of the ministry, to watch over their own spirits, and not to be over hasty or censorious in passing judgment respecting the state of thos w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> hear them; but to manifest that, in the exercise of their ministry, they are led by the love of God; and that their principal aim is, that they may be in∣strumental to administer spiritual consolation and strength to the churches where they come.</P>
<P>Farther we earnestly exhort, that none would offer to impose themselves as preachers, in any meeting of friends, who are not themselves faithful against the payment of priests wages, and in observing the other branches of our Christian testimony. 1745.</P>
<P>We tenderly and with earnestness advise all friends, who travel in the work of the ministry, as well as others, that they not only shut their ears against all private informations of persons and things, tending to the defamation of particular persons or families, and to stir up disputes and contentions in meet∣ings for discipline; but also to rebuke and reprove the person or persons, who shall attempt to prejudice their minds with any private informations of that nature. 1752.</P>
<P>The spirit of God being be foundation of all true knowledge and expe∣rience, both in ministers and hearers, we earnestly exhort that all would dili∣gently wait upon, and mind it: Ministers, in their public services especially, ought always to attend closely to their several and peculiar gifts, and minister the word faithfully as it is manifested and revealed to them; observing a decent and modest behaviour in the exercise of their ministry, and not entan∣gling themselves with the affairs of this life, that they may the better answer the holy warfare in which they are engaged. And let the hearers be watchful
<PB N="87" REF="019014_0074_0FA95D8C4A343690"/>over their own spirits, and not forwardly judge or censure the testimonies which may be delivered amongst them; for if they be not very careful and diligent in attending upon the Lord in meetings, they are liable to mistake in the judgment they may pass on the ministry.</P>
<P>Now this being a matter of great moment, for the preservation of love and concord in the churches; and knowing the danger and ill consequences which attend an hasty and censorious judging of the ministry, we think it necessary to caution friends not to let their own spirits sway them, but let the Spirit of God rule and reign in their hearts; for this will preserve all in sweet∣ness and tenderness one towards another: The due observance of which will be a great help to ministers in the discharge of their duty, and the service to which they are called.</P>
<P>And we earnestly request, that the elders in monthly and quarterly-meet∣ings would be ready to help and inform the weak, when suitable opportunities present; and that both ministers and hearers, pursuing one and the same end, namely, the glory of God, and the good and welfare one of another, the church may be edified, increase and flourish, to the consolation of the faithful.</P>
<P>On the other hand, we advise ministers to have it very much at heart, to maintain a perfect harmony and good understanding with the monthly-meet∣ings to which they belong; that as the said meetings may sometimes find themselves concerned to advise them, respecting their conduct in meetings, or otherwise, they shew themselves ready to hear and receive advice, as well as to teach and instruct.</P>
<P>We further advise all monthly-meetings, to take great care in giving cer∣tificates to those who travel, to prevent the uneasiness which sometimes falls on the church, from a weak and unskilful ministry; and let the elders, when they see occasion, advise ministers to be very prudent in their conduct, not as busy bodies, nor meddling with family or personal affairs, in which they are not concerned, or required to be assisting; that they be very tender of one another's reputation, and of that of friends among whom they travel; neither giving ear to nor spreading reports, tending to raise in the minds of others a
<PB N="88" REF="019014_0075_0FA95E32CD9084D8"/>lessening or disesteem of any of the brotherhood; and as soon as their service in the ministry is over, that they return to their habitations, and there take a reasonable and prudent care of their own business, houshold and family. 1731.</P>
<P>Our blessed Lord, just before his ascension, commanded his disciples to wait at Jerusalem, till they were endued with power from on high; knowing their inability, without the sensible feeling of that power, to speak in his name for the conversion of the nations. It was this power that enabled them to speak boldly in the name of Jesus: This alone that made them able mini∣sters of Christ; whose preaching was not with enticing words of man's wis∣dom, but in the demonstration of the Spirit, and with power.</P>
<P>And seeing many of us have experienced much spiritual consolation, by waiting in silence and humbly depending upon the Lord alone, we exhort friends, that when met together for religious worship, they labour to feel their minds abstracted from visible objects, into a true stillness and nothing∣ness of self; wherein the teachings of the Holy Spirit are witnessed by humble and contrite souls.</P>
<P>In such a waiting state, you will have a true relish and savour of the mini∣stry of those who are rightly concerned by the same spirit, to labour in word and doctrine among you. 1738.</P>
<P>We earnestly caution and intreat all such among you, as find themselves concerned in Christian love to exhort and admonish others, that they be especially careful of their own conduct; that by circumspect walking in all holiness of life and conversation, they may become living examples of the puri∣ty and excellence of the advices they recommend. 1748.</P>
<P>You that are elders and overseers in the church, and concerned in the maintenance of good order and preservation of discipline, keep your own hands clean, and garments unspotted, that you may rebuke with authority, and being cloathed with the meekness and gentleness of the Lamb, may stedfastly per∣severe in the support of that testimony committed to you, that when the Great Shepherd shall appear, you may come before him with reverent assurance,

<P>As to the elders among you, and such whom God, having endued with knowledge and experience of the cleansing operations of his Spirit, hath concerned to minister to others, let them adorn the doctrine of the gospel, by shewing, out of a good conversation, their works with meekness of wisdom: Such as these, being cloathed with humility, and exemplary to the flock whom the feed; not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; are worthy of double honour, and to be highly esteemed in the church of Christ. 1751.</P>
<P>As the Lord is graciously pleased effectually to touch the hearts of many of the youth, and prepare them for the reception of his heavenly gifts, where∣by many are called to the work of the ministry; and well knowing it is a due attention to the gift, and waiting for the heavenly power and life to dis∣charge themselves therein, which has ever proved a blessing to the particular, and the churches in general; we earnestly recommend, that the elders and sensible solid friends do watch over such in an holy concern for their and the churches good; that the weak and tender may be encouraged in a faithful discharge of their duty, and where a forward spirit appears, that would lead into many words out of the power and life, such may be properly admonished in the meekness of wisdom, that each may speak the language of truth, by the ability which the Lord only gives; and that the monthly-meetings do not indulge any to travel and appoint meetings too soon, for many have been hurt thereby. 1753.</P>
<P>We recommend the apostolic advice, "Lay hands on no man suddenly," for we have cause to believe that injudicious encouragement hath tended to promote an unsound ministry in some places. It is therefore recommended, that the approved ministers and elders, in the several monthly-meetings, would tenderly advise those who come forth in public testimony, to wait patiently under a deep consideration of their state of infancy and childhood, without desiring to be introduced into the meeting of ministers and elders, until their
<PB N="90" REF="019014_0077_0FA95E358EF27638"/>fruits afford sufficient evidence of their qualifications for so important a ser∣vice, and they approved of by the monthly and quarterly-meetings to which they belong; that such young ministers be reported to their monthly and quarterly-meetings; which, upon solid and deliberate consideration, may, as in the wisdom of truth shall seem meet, recommend them to the select-meeting of ministers and elders, in order to their becoming regular members of those meetings. 1773.</P>
<P>Looking into the state of this part of the society, which stands in a more conspicuous point of view than the more private members, the necessity of their being ensamples to the flock appears exceeding great, particularly in a diligent attendance of all our meetings for solemn worship and the discipline of the church, and therein to be very deep and weighty in spirit, labouring with an ardour of soul suited to the occasion, for the arising of the ancient spring of life; which of a truth is the crown of our assemblies, and the ground of our joy and rejoicing in him, and one in another: It being this alone which preserves living, fresh and active members in the church of Christ, who are enabled to communicate a degree of warmth to the rising youth, and those of less experience in this most necessary exercise; not only in word and doctrine, but also in silent, humble waiting on God, for the renewings of help day by day.</P>
<P>That where it shall appear, upon due inspection made, that any member shall or do neglect or omit the due attendance of their meetings for worship and discipline, through sloth, indolence, love of the world, lukewarmness in religion or other insufficient cause, that each monthly-meeting take care, that all such be timely visited in love, and acquainted with the desire and mind of friends in that case, and admonished to faithfulness therein. And if, not∣withstanding the due Christian labour and admonition, he, she or they, shall continue in the said neglect or omission; if a minister, his or her public testi∣mony be denied; and if an elder, he or she be dismissed from that station. 1770.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="019014_0078_0FA95E35CB730F90"/>
Advised to have a godly care of judging or contradicting one another in pub∣lic meetings, or shewing any marks or signs of division therein, among ministers or others; it being of a very pernicious consequence to bring blame or contempt upon the ministry, and a great hurt to our youth and others. 1716.</P>
<P>This meeting taking under their serious consideration the beauty and credit of keeping decency and good order in our meetings for worship, advises friends every where to avoid public opposition to a minister not disowned by the monthly or quarterly-meeting to which he or she shall belong, by keeping on their hats in time of prayer, or any other tokens of disunion.</P>
<P>But if any person, pretending to be a minister, shall give cause of uneasi∣ness or dissatisfaction to friends, in doctrine, behaviour or conversation, the person so offending is to be dealt with privately in a gospel spirit and manner: If this shall not take effect, then let complaint be made of such person to the monthly-meeting which he or she may belong to; that proceeding thereon be had accordingly, and the affair settled with all possible expedition. 1723.</P>
<P>Where friends in any monthly-meeting are really dissatisfied, or burthened with any that take upon them to preach among them, let them first be duly admonished in their own monthly-meeting, with the assistance of the faithful approved ministers and elders of the same meeting, and adjacent meetings, if need be; and if afterwards they will persist to impose upon and burthen friends, then to be publicly testified against, where they so impose.</P>
<P>If any one who has been a public minister or elder shall be guilty of such practices as may justly deserve public censure, and shall be disowned, and afterwards, upon tokens of repentance, be again admitted into membership; such readmission is not to be interpreted so as to give him or her the liberty of appearing as a public minister, or exercising the office of an elder, until the monthly-meeting he or she belongs to shall judge the scandal given by such person is so far removed, as that such public appearance, or exercising the office of an elder, may not administer occasion of reproach, either from friends or others; and in case they should shew themselves too forward in so appearing, the meeting to which they belong are desired to give them such advice as they shall see suitable to their circumstance. 1737.</P>

A MEMORIAL of some necessary advices recommended to ministers, and, in the love of the gospel, to be communicated to the several meetings of ministers and elders in the yearly-meeting, as caution and counsel.</P>
<P N="1">1. Against undue and restless behaviour, under the ministry of any friend, whilst in the unity of the body.</P>
<P N="2">2. That all be cautious of using unnecessary preambles, and laying too great stress on their testimony, by too positively asserting a divine motion, and frequently repeating the fame; seeing no such pretensions will obtain credit, when it is not manifestly so; and where it is, the baptizing power of truth, accompanying the words, is the best evidence.</P>
<P N="3">3. Against misquoting and misapplying the Holy Scriptures; and it is desired that all those concerned be frequent in reading them.</P>
<P N="4">4. To be careful how they fall on disputed points in their testimony, and making such objections as they do not clearly answer; and also against giving repeated expectations of coming to a conclusion, recommending the people, &amp;c.</P>
<P N="5">5. Against hurting meetings, towards the conclusion, by unnecessary addi∣tions, when the meeting was left well before.</P>
<P N="6">6. Against unbecoming tones, sounds, gestures, and all affectation; which are not agreeable to Christian gravity.</P>
<P N="7">7. Against undertaking or running into employments they have no know∣ledge or experience of, without the concurrence and advice of friends, as some have done, to their own hurt, the injury of others, and the reproach of their religious profession; but to employ themselves in business that they are acquainted with, to avoid an idle life.</P>
<P N="8">8. Not to speak against persons, or report things on hearsay; but to treat with the parties concerned, and thereby prevent sowing discord.</P>
<P N="9">9. That their apparel, and the furniture of their houses, their tables, and way of living, may be with decency, moderation and temperance; that they be good examples to others.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="93" REF="019014_0080_0FA95E3906B8C788"/>
10. Against men and women travelling together, as companions in service, to avoid all occasions of offence thereby.</P>
<P N="11">11. To beware of too much familiarity, tending to draw out the affections one of another, to their hurt.</P>
<P N="12">12. That ministering friends be careful not to hurt one another's service in public meetings, but every one have a tender regard for others; that nothing be offered with a view to popularity, but in humility and the fear of the Lord.</P>
<P N="13">13. Against running, in their own wills, to disturb or interrupt any people in their worship; or presuming to prophecy, in their own spirits, against any nation, city, town, people, or person.</P>
<P N="14">14. That ministers, when they travel in the service of truth, be careful not to make their visits burthensome, or the gospel chargeable.</P>
<P N="15">15. That none shew or expose manuscripts, so as to give expectations of their being printed, before they are approved by the meeting for sufferings.</P>
<P N="16">16. That ministers and elders be careful to keep their whole conversation unspotted, being examples of meekness, temperance, patience and charity.</P>
<P>And lastly, as prayer and supplication to God is an especial part of his worship, it must be performed in spirit and in truth, with a right understand∣ing seasoned with grace. Therefore let ministers be careful how and what they offer in prayer, avoiding many words and repetitions, and not to run from supplication into declaration, as though the Lord wanted information: And let all be cautious of too often repeating the High and Holy Name, or his attributes, by a long conclusion; neither let prayer be in a formal and customary way, to conclude a meeting, without an awful sense of divine assistance attending the mind. 1703, 1755.</P>
<P>Agreed that when public friends have a concern to travel on a religious visit, and appoint meetings out of the quarterly-meeting they belong to, or to attend the sittings of neighbouring yearly-meetings, or quarterly-meeting belonging thereunto, they seasonably communicate the same to the elders of their respective meetings for their advice and concurrence, before they move it to the monthly-meeting, in order for a certificate.</P>
<P><PB N="94" REF="019014_0081_0FA95E3993645718"/>
And when their concern extends to visiting the churches, within any other of the yearly-meetings on this continent, they proceed in like manner. And when the monthly-meeting have given their certificate, they acquaint the quarterly-meeting therewith for their concurrence, which is to be first had before the friend proceed. And when the concern extends to Europe, or beyond sea, as the most weighty, clear and deliberate evidence should be obtained in so important a service, in which the reputation of society may be more immediately concerned; it is therefore recommended, that unless such considerations should prevent, which the quarterly and monthly-meeting may judge sufficient, the approbation of the yearly-meeting of ministers and elders should be likewise obtained.</P>
<P>QUERIES of the Yearly-Meeting of Ministers and Elders.</P>
<P N="1">1. Are ministers and elders careful duly to attend all their meetings for worship and dicipline, bringing with them as many of their families as they can? And are they good examples in humble waiting therein, not giving way to drowsiness?</P>
<P N="2">2. Are ministers sound in word and doctrine, careful to minister in the ability God gives and thereby kept from burthening the living?</P>
<P N="3">3. Are the lives and conversations of ministers and elders clean and blameless amongst men? Are they in unity one with another, and with the meeting they belong to, harmoniously labouring together for truth's honour, and careful to give no just occasion of offence to any?</P>
<P N="4">4. Do they rule their own houses well, bringing up their families in plain∣ness which truth requires, in dress, language and true moderation? And are they good examples in those respects themselves?</P>
<P N="5">5. Are they peace-makers in families and in the church, not concerned in raising or spreading evil reports, nor busy bodies where they have no pro∣per business?</P>
<P N="6"><PB N="95" REF="019014_0082_0FA95E3A54449170"/>
6. Are they careful to maintain the discipline in every part thereof, not even to hide their own families from truth's judgment, if occasion be given, but impartially to administer justice as faithful servants?</P>
<P N="7">7. Do any travel abroad as ministers, without being first recommended to and accepted by the quarterly-meeting as such? And do any appoint meet∣ings out of the limits of the quarterly-meeting they belong to, without a cer∣tificate from the monthly-meeting of business, or the concurrence thereof?</P>
<P>It is further earnestly and affectionately recommended that ministers and elders watch over one another for good, to help those who are young in the ministry in the right line, discouraging forward spirits that run into words without life and power, advising against affectation of tones and gestures, and every thing that would hurt their service; yet encouraging the humble, care∣ful traveller, speaking a word in season to them that are weary. And let all dwell in that which gives ability to labour successfully in the church of Christ, adorning the doctrine they deliver to others, being examples of the believers in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, and in purity.</P>

<HEAD>MONTHLY-MEETINGS.</HEAD>
<P>IN the love of Christ we earnestly exhort you to watch diligently over the flock of God, and deal in due time, and in a spirit of Christian love and tenderness, with all such as walk disorderly amongst you, in order to reclaim and restore them by brotherly counsel and admonition; and when, after patient waiting, you find that your Christian labour of love hath not its desired effect, you neglect not to testify against and disown such persons, and thereby prevent the reproach and dishonour which may be brought upon our holy profession through their means, that the end and design of our wholesome discipline may be answered.</P>
<P>We think it both unseasonable and dishonourable, when persons apply to monthly-meetings on account of marriage, or for relief in case of necessity or any similar occasion, then to object to them such offences as the meeting, through neglect of their own duty, have suffered long to pass by them unre∣proved and unnoticed. 1743.</P>
<P>It is the ancient and constant sense of friends, that any person denied by a monthly-meeting, is adjudged as disowned by friends, and to stand and re∣main in that state, till by his repentance, or by the reversal of such denial by a superior meeting, he is reconciled to friends, or reinstated in member∣ship among them, with which this meeting hath unity, and therefore confirms the same. 1727.</P>
<P>When a person commits an offence, as soon as it comes to the knowledge of the meeting wherein he resides, he not being a member thereof, that meet∣ing shall acquaint the meeting of which he is a member therewith.</P>
<P>The meeting of which he is a member shall then proceed to visit and deal with him, unless by reason of distance it be not convenient; in which
<PB N="97" REF="019014_0084_0FA95E3BCE98C548"/>case they shall apply to the monthly-meeting in which the offender resides, to act for them and visit him; and they shall report their proceedings to the meeting of which he is a member, which meeting shall receive his acknow∣ledgment, or disown him, as in their judgment the case shall require.</P>
<P>If a testimony of denial be issued, a copy thereof shall be sent to the meet∣ing in the compass of which the offender resides, who shall acquaint him therewith, and read it in a public meeting, if they see meet, and acknowledge the receipt thereof to the meeting that sent it.</P>
<P>If the offender remove after dealing be commenced, the meeting that had him under their care shall continue the same, if he be equally within their reach, or otherwise write to the meeting into the compass of which he is removed, which meeting shall proceed therein, and report to the meeting of which he is a member, who shall receive his acknowledgment, or proceed to deny him as aforesaid. But if the monthly-meeting where the offence is committed judge the case to be of such a nature as to require their more speedy dealing, and even disowning the offender, for the clearing of truth according to our ancient care and practice; they are at liberty so to do, giving the meeting the offender did belong to as early notice thereof as they can. 1747, 1782.</P>
<P>In case offenders shall remove to places not within the acknowledged limits of any monthly-meeting, it is agreed that they shall be under the care of the meeting to which they are the nearest situated.</P>
<P>If the offender cannot be found after reasonable enquiry, the meeting to which he belongs, on notice thereof, shall issue a testimony against him, if the nature of the case require it, and acquaint the other meeting or meetings thereof.</P>
<P>When a person is disowned by a monthly-meeting of which he was a pro∣per member, and afterwards removes into, and resides within, the compass of another meeting, he having come to repentance, and being desirous to be restored into unity, the necessary acknowledgment should be made to the monthly-meeting by which he was disowned; which acknowledgment being
<PB N="98" REF="019014_0085_0FA95E3CB4D131C8"/>received and accepted, he shall be deemed a member of the said meeting 1763.</P>
<P>We recommend to friends in their several monthly-meetings, to take espe∣cial care to appoint proper, prudent and judicious friends, to visit their brethren in their families, to inform, advise or admonish, pursuant to former advices; and that such friends labour faithfully in a spirit of love, and in the meekness of wisdom, to convince the judgments of their respective members of the necessity of their coming up with their brethren in practice, agreeable to our Christian principle, that so the several branches of the testimony, which truth hath given our ancients and us to bear, may be maintained in∣violate. 1733, 1751.</P>
<P>It is recommended, that the book of discipline be present in all our month∣ly, quarterly and yearly-meetings, that the same may be consulted as occasion requires; and as opportunity offers, such portions thereof be read in each monthly-meeting, the women being present, as the elders, overseers or other concerned friends, may from time to time think proper, for the instruction, help and furtherance of the young and rising generation, and such as may not otherwise be conversant or acquainted therewith.</P>

<HEAD>NEGROES and SLAVES.</HEAD>
<P N="1">1. IT is the sense of this meeting, that the importation of Negroes from their native country and relations<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This intended as slaves, or against their consent.</NOTE> is not a commendable nor allow∣able practice, and that practice is censured by this meeting. 1727.</P>
<P N="2">2. We fervently warn all in profession with us, that they be careful to avoid being any way concerned in reaping the unrighteous profits of that iniquitous practice of dealing in Negroes, and other slaves; whereby, in the original purchase, one man selleth another as he does the beast that perishes, without any better pretension to a property in him than that of superior force, in direct violation of the gospel rule, which teaches every one to do as they would be done by, and to do good unto all; being the reverse of that covet∣ous disposition, which furnishes encouragement to those poor ignorant people to perpetuate their savage wars, in order to supply the demands of this most unnatural traffic, whereby great numbers of mankind, free by nature, are subjected to inextricable bondage; and which hath often been observed to fill their possessors with haughtiness and tyranny, luxury and barbarity; cor∣rupting the minds and debasing the morals of their children, to the unspeak∣able prejudice of religion and virtue, and the exclusion of that holy spirit of universal love, meekness and charity, which is the unchangeable nature and the glory of true Christianity: We therefore can do no less than with the greatest earnestness impress it upon friends every where, that they endeavour to keep their hands clear of this unrighteous gain of oppression. 1760.</P>
<P N="3">3. It is recommended to friends, who have slaves in possession, to treat them with tend<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> impress God's fear in their minds, promote their

<P N="4">4. It is our sense and judgment, that truth not only requires that the young, of capacity and ability, but likewise the aged and impotent, and also all in a state of infancy and non-age among friends, be discharged and set free from a state of slavery; that we do no more claim property in the human race, as we do in the brutes that perish; and it is to be understood, that the aged and impotent, and also infants and those in their non-age, be provided for, brought up and instructed, as required by our tenth query. 1773.</P>
<P>Agreed that no friend import, or any ways purchase, dispose of or hold man∣kind as slaves; but that all those who have been held in a state of slavery be discharged therefrom; that all those be used well who are under friends care, and are not in circumstances, through non-age or incapacity, to minister to their own necessities; and that they give those that are young such an education as become Christians, and encourage others in a religious and virtuous life. 1773, 1780.</P>

<HEAD>OATHS.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED that our Christian testimony be faithfully maintained against the burthen and imposition of oaths, according to the express prohibition of Christ, and also of the apostle James, viz. <Q>Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt not forswear thy∣self, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: But I say unto you, Swear not at all: Neither by heaven; for it is God's throne: Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: Neither by Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one hair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil,</Q> Mat. v. 33—37.</P>
<P><Q>But above all things, my brethren, swear not; neither by heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: But let your yea, be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into condemnation,</Q> James v. 12. 1693.</P>
<P>Agreed that oaths administered by judges, justices, select-men, town-councils or other officers, who are under the care of friends, is a violation of our ancient testimony; and that such persons ought to be dealt with as offenders. Nor are such officers clear, who admit of clerks or others to administer oaths before them, when sitting in their office, unless there be a number of others present, not of our society, sufficient to authorize the same. 1733.</P>

<HEAD>ORPHANS, WILLS, EXECUTORS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>KNOWING how quickly many are removed by death, it is weightily recommended that care be taken, in each monthly-meeting, that friends who have estates to dispose of, by will or otherwise, be advised to make their wills in time of health, and strength of judgment, and to dispose of their substance as in justice and wisdom may be to their satisfaction; to prevent the inconveniences, loss and trouble, that may fall upon their relations and friends, through their dying intestate. Making such wills, in due time, can shorten no man's days; but the omission or delay thereof has proved very injurious to many. 1691.</P>
<P>Advised that friends, in making their wills, have a strict regard to justice and equity, and be not actuated by caprice and prejudice, to the injury of those who may have a reasonable expectation from their kindred and near connexions; nor carry any resentment, though occasion may have been given or taken, to the grave, remembering we all stand in need of mercy and forgiveness. Also that none postpone making their wills to a sick bed; an improper season to settle our outward affairs, in the painful struggles of nature, even if we should be favoured with a clear understanding, which ought not to be diverted from a solemn consideration of the approaching awful period of life.</P>
<P>Friends are earnestly recommended to employ persons capable, and of good repute, to write their wills; as great inconvenience and loss, and some∣times the ruin of families, hath happened through the unskilfulness of some who have taken upon them to write wills, being unqualified to act in an affair of such importance. And all friends, who may become executors or administrators, are advised to make a full, clear and proper inventory of the
<PB N="106" REF="019014_0091_0FA95E4416055058"/>estate and effects of the deceased, as soon as may be after the interment; as many difficulties and disputes have arisen for want of it, where it has been deferred. 1782.</P>
<P>Recommended that friends, who have young children, do in their wills appoint faithful friends to be guardians to them, till they arrive to lawful age: That monthly-meetings take care that such guardians do discharge their trust with justice and uprightness; and that orphans be admonished to be subject to the wills of their deceased parents, as the said meetings shall see cause. 1706.</P>
<P>Executors and trustees, concerned in wills and settlements, are advised to take especial care that they faithfully discharge their respective trusts, accord∣ing to the intent of the donors and testators; and that all charitable gifts, lega∣cies, bequests, and settlement of estates, by will or deed, intended and given for the use of the poor, the aged, the impotent, or putting poor friends children to education or apprenticeships, may not be appropriated or converted to any other uses than such as the donors and testators have directed and enjoined by legal settlement, will, or testament. 1715.</P>

<HEAD>PARENTS and GUARDIANS.</HEAD>
<P>WE do intreat and desire all parents and governors of families, that ye diligently lay to heart your work and calling in your generation, for the Lord, and the charge committed to you; not only in being good examples to the younger sort, but also to use your power in your own families in edu∣cating your children and servants in modesty, sobriety, and in the fear of God, curbing the extravagant humour in the young ones, when it doth appear; and not to indulge or allow of it: For you are set in your families as judges for God, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> you that must give an account of the power committed to you. And w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> you see a libertine and wanton spirit appear in your children and servants, that lusteth after the vain customs and fashions of the world, either in habit, or outward adorning, and craves your assistance and allowance, with∣out which it cannot get forward while they are under your government; Oh! then look to yourselves, and discharge your trust for God, and for the good of their souls, exhorting in meekness, and commanding in wisdom; that so you may minister and reach to the witness, and help them over their temptations in the authority of God's power; and when they feel themselves helped and delivered, their souls will bless God for you, and you will reap the comfort of your labour. 1688.</P>
<P>We advise and exhort, that all masters of families, parents, guardians, and tutors of children, would frequently put in practice the calling together of their children and houshold, to wait upon the Lord in their families; that receiving wisdom and counsel from him, they may be enabled seasonably to exhort and encourage them to walk in the way of the Lord; to exercise themselves in reading the Holy Scriptures, and in observing the duties and precepts of holy living therein recommended; admonishing them to keep
<PB N="108" REF="019014_0093_0FA95E468CBA50E8"/>to that plainness and simplicity in apparel, speech and behaviour, which the spirit of truth led our forefathers into, and which becomes the humble, self-denying followers of holy Jesus. 1748.</P>
<P>It is our Christian and earnest advice and counsel to all friends concerned, (so far as they are able, or may be capable) to provide schoolmasters and mistresses, who are faithful friends, to teach and instruct their children; and not to send them to such schools, where they are taught the corrupt ways, manners, fashions and language of the world, and of the heathen in their authors, and names of the heathenish gods and goddesses, tending greatly to corrupt and alienate the minds of children into an averseness or opposition to the truth, and the simplicity of it: But to take care that you train up your children in the good nurture, admonition and fear of the Lord, in that plain∣ness and language which become truth. And parents and masters, &amp;c. to be good examples to them, in a sober and godly conversation, and plainness of speech; and not to use the word you, or ye, to a child or servant, &amp;c. nor suffer your substance to be bestowed on your children, to furnish them with such things as tend to pride, and to lift them up in vanity, or affect them with the vain fashions of the world. 1690.</P>
<P>It being under consideration how friends children might be disposed of, that are trained up in the way of truth, and fit to be put forth apprentices; it is the advice and counsel of friends, that special care be taken to p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t them apprentices to honest friends, that they may be preserved in the way of truth. 1697.</P>

<P>And it is agreed that none be placed out to any not of our society, unless some special circumstance may induce the monthly-meeting to think it best; and when any parent or guardian thinks any such special circumstance do attend, they may lay the same before the monthly-meeting where they be∣long,

<HEAD>PLAINNESS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is also our concern to exhort all friends, both men and women, to watch against the growing sin of pride, and beware of adorning them∣selves in a manner disagreeable to the plainness and simplicity of the truth we make profession of. Oh! that they would duly consider that severe re∣proof which the Lord, by the mouth of his prophet, pronounced against the haughty daughters of Zion, Isaiah iii. where it describes even the particularities of their dressings and ornaments, so displeasing to the Lord, and drawing down his judgments upon them. If those things in that time were so offensive in the eyes of the Lord, how much more so are they now, in a people professing the plainness and simplicity which the gospel of Christ recommends?</P>
<P>"I will," saith the apostle Paul, <Q>that women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shamefacedness and sobriety; not with broidered hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly array; but, which becometh women professing godliness, with good works,</Q> 1 Tim. ii. 9, 10; where he plainly sheweth that such adornings are contrary to the profession of godliness. The apostle Peter also is very full in his exhortations on this subject, "Whose adorning," says he, <Q>let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting the hair, and of wearing of gold, and of putting on of apparel; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of God of great price; for after this manner, in the old time, the holy women also, who trusted in God, adorned them∣selves.</Q> 1 Pet. iii. 3, 4, 5; plainly intimating, that those who of old were holy, and did trust in God, placed not their delight in such ornaments. Oh, that ye would weigh and consider these things! <Q>Let your moderation be known unto all men, and grieve not the Holy Spirit of God; but be ye
<PB N="112" REF="019014_0096_0FA95E4B95DC15A8"/>followers of him, as dear children, walking circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</Q> 1739.</P>
<P>Let not any such as degenerate, in these respects, excuse their own weak∣ness, under a pretence of the misconduct of some, who have appeared outwardly plain; an objection of very little weight: For did they rightly consider, they would clearly see, that the very reason why deceivers sometimes put on plain apparel, is, because true men have been accustomed to wear it.</P>
<P>We also tenderly advise, that friends take heed, especially those who should be exemplary to others under their care, that they exercise plainness of speech, without respect of persons, in all their converse among men; and not baulk their testimony by a cowardly compliance, varying their language according to their company: A practice of very ill example to our observing youth, and rendering those who use it contemptible, and looked upon as a kind of hypocrites, even by those with whom they so comply: Such a mean-spirited practice seems to be cautioned against by the apostle, when he advises, 1 Tim. "That the deacons be grave, not double-tongued;" a caution plainly import∣ing, that it is inconsistent with the gravity of the gospel. 1743.</P>
<P>Where any do not keep themselves, or their children, in moderation and plainness, in gesture, speech, apparel, and furniture of their houses; or accus∣tom themselves, or suffer their children, to use the corrupt and unscriptural language of (you) to a single person; or to call the days or months by the names given them by the heathen, in honour to their idols, contrary to the ancient advices of friends, to which we refer: It is desired and advised, that friends from time to time, as such things appear, be stirred up in the wisdom of truth, to take due and prudent care therein; and if any, by continuing in such practices, reject the advice and labour of their friends, then let such cases be brought forward to the monthly-meeting, for further care and deal∣ing, as may appear necessary, for the support of our Christian testimony.</P>

<HEAD>POOR.</HEAD>
<P>WITH respect to the poor amongst us, it ought to be considered, that the poor, both parents and children, are of our family, and ought not to be turned off to any others for their support or education; and although some may think the poor a burthen, yet be it remembered, when our poor are well provided for, and walk orderly, they are an ornament to our society; and the rich should consider it is more blessed to give than to receive, and that he who giveth to the poor, lendeth to the Lord, who will repay. 1718.</P>
<P>As mercy, compassion and charity, are eminently required in this new-covenant dispensation we are under; so, respecting the poor and indigent among us, and to see there be no beggar in our Israel, it is the advice of this meeting that all poor friends be taken due care of, and none of them sent to the town or parish to be relieved; and that nothing be wanting for their necessary supply; which has been according to our ancient practice and testi∣mony. And it has long been of good report, that we have not only main∣tained our own poor, but also contributed our share to the poor of the respec∣tive towns and parishes wherein we dwell. 1720.</P>
<P>Advised that where friends want ability in the world, their monthly and quarterly-meetings assist them, that the children of the poor may have due help of education, instruction, and necessary learning; and that the children both of the rich and the poor may early be provided with useful employments, that they may not grow up in idleness, looseness and vice; but that being seasoned with the truth, taught our holy self-denying way, and sanctified of God, they may become a reputation to our holy profession, the comfort of their honest parents, instrumental to the glory of God, and the good of the succeeding generations. 1709.</P>
<P><PB N="114" REF="019014_0098_0FA95E4D185EA1D8"/>
And as one of the first and great causes which engaged our ancient friends to the orderly establishing our Christian discipline, was the care of the poor; and as expences must necessarily arise for their support and education, it is re∣commended to each monthly-meeting, of men and women friends, that they be open-hearted and liberal in their subscriptions for the supply of the poor; and that a treasurer be appointed to receive the same, and open to each meeting of men and women; and two or more suitable friends, men and women, be annually appointed as overseers of the poor, whose business and duty it should be to visit, inspect and relieve them, as becometh the followers of Christ, and that two or more friends be appointed as an audit to settle the treasurers and overseers accounts.</P>

<P>WHEN a quarterly-meeting hath come to a judgment respecting any difference, relative to any monthly-meeting belonging to them, and notified the same in writing to such monthly-meeting, the said monthly-meeting ought to submit to the judgment of the quarterly-meeting; but if such monthly-meeting shall not be satisfied therewith, then the monthly-meet∣ing may appeal to the yearly-meeting, against the judgment and determination of the quarterly-meeting.</P>

<P>And if any of the monthly-meetings, to which the quarterly-meeting shall join the whole or a part of the late monthly-meeting, do think themselves aggrieved, they shall be at liberty to appeal against the quarterly-meeting to the yearly-meeting; and until such appeal is heard and determined, the

<P>It is recommended that all contention and personal reflexions be kept out of our meetings: That all friends be careful to keep out of heats and pas∣sions, and doubtful disputations; and that we suffer no turbulent, contentious person amongst us, in ordering and managing the affairs of truth; but that the same be managed in the peaceable spirit and wisdom of Jesus, with decency, forbearance and love, to each other.</P>
<P N="1">1. Are all meetings for religious worship and discipline duly attended, the hour observed; and are friends preserved from sleeping, or any other unbecoming behaviour therein?</P>
<P N="2">2. Is love and unity maintained amongst you, as becomes the followers of Christ? Are tale-bearing, back-biting, and evil reports, discouraged? And where any differences arise, are endeavours used speedily to end them?</P>

<P N="4">4. Are friends careful to avoid the use of spirituous liquors, except for medicine, or upon extraordinary and necessary occasions? The unnecessary frequenting of taverns, and places of public resort? And to keep in true

<P N="5">5. Are the circumstances of the poor, and such as appear likely to need assistance, duly inspected; and their necessities relieved, or they assisted in such business as they are capable of? Do their children freely partake of learning, to fit them for business? And are they, and other friends children, placed among friends?</P>
<P N="6">6. Do parents and guardians discountenance those under their care accom∣panying on account of marriage, without their consent? And do none unmar∣ried make or admit proposals, or accompany with each other on that account, without the consent of their parents or guardians first obtained? Or with those not of our society, on that account? And do all friends discounte∣nance disorderly marriages?</P>
<P N="7">7. Do you maintain a faithful testimony against the payment of priests wages, bearing of arms, training, or other military matters? Against being concerned in property taken in war, buying or vending goods suspected to be run, and against making of false entries, to evade the payment of duties?</P>
<P N="8">8. Are friends careful frequently to inspect their affairs, settle their ac∣counts, and make their wills whilst in health; and take friends advice therein, when necessary? And are public gifts and legacies applied to the use in∣tended by the donor?</P>
<P N="9">9. Are friends careful to maintain our testimony faithfully against slavery? And do they educate and encourage in virtue those under their care who have been held therein?</P>
<P N="10">10. Are there any friends deficient in performing their promises, or pay∣ing their just debts, or that launch into business beyond their ability to manage in the truth?

<P N="12">12. Do you take due care regularly to deal with all offenders, in the spirit of meekness and wisdom, without partiality or unnecessary delay? And is judgment placed where it appears necessary, in the authority of truth, accord∣ing to our discipline?</P>

Agreed, when any friend removes without applying for a certificate, the monthly-meeting from whence he removed should, as speedily as they can, ac∣quaint the monthly-meeting within whose limits he or she resides, of the cir∣cumstances in which they left them, in order for their knowledge and care in dealing with them for such neglect; and if, after their discharging a Christian duty towards them, they cannot be brought to a proper sense of their irregu∣larity, so as to comply with what is directed in such cases, that they, upon information thereof being received by the meeting from whence they re∣moved, said meeting should have liberty to make a record on their minutes, setting forth their disapprobation of such conduct; and that the said person having disregarded the good order of our religious society, has thereby rendered him or herself unworthy of membership among us; a copy of which minute should be sent to the monthly-meeting where they reside, to be deliver∣ed to them, after which, if a husband or a father, a certificate should be sent for the wife and children of such person, if any there be; or, if a mother, for the children; nevertheless it is not hereby intended to lessen the authority given to monthly-meetings, within whose limits any person may so remove and afterwards misbehave, from dealing with and testifying against them, if they should see cause.</P>

<P>ADVISED that school-masters and mistresses, who are faithful friends, and well qualified, be encouraged in all places where there may be need; and that care be taken, that poor friends children may freely partake of such education, as may tend to their benefit and advantage, in order to apprenticeship. 1695.</P>
<P>Quarterly and monthly-meetings are desired to take care, that in all places where schools are set up for teaching of friends children, the masters be dili∣gent to improve and forward their scholars in learning, and to keep them out of every thing that would corrupt good manners. 1697.</P>
<P>It is the renewed concern of this meeting, to recommend a care for the off∣spring of such parents, whose earnings or income are so small, as to render them incapable of giving their children a suitable and guarded education, and that especially from home, by which they may be prevented from mixing with others not of our religious persuasion, which so often leads into hurtful habits, from which they are not afterwards easily reclaimed; and as some of our members may incautiously permit their offspring to suffer this great loss, rather than apply for assistance from their monthly-meetings, it is recommend∣ed to friends in every monthly-meeting to seek out such of their members as may be thus straightened, and administer to their help; and it is desired that such will receive the salutary aid with a willing mind, and thankfulness to the great Author of all good. 1777.</P>
<P>It is advised that each monthly meeting appoint a solid, judicious com∣mittee, whose care should be to meet as often as occasion requires, and con∣sult together, and assist friends in procuring friends to teach schools, and to advise and assist them in the regulation thereof; and encourage friends to send their children to the same.</P>

<HEAD>SCRIPTURES.</HEAD>
<P>RECOMMENDED as an incumbent duty on friends, to cause their children to be frequent in reading the Holy Scriptures, and in observ∣ing to them the examples of such children, as in Scripture are recorded to have early learned the fear of the Lord, and hearkened to his counsel: Instruct∣ing them in the fear and dread of the Lord; planting upon their spirits impressions of reverence towards God, from whom they have their daily support; shewing them they ought not to offend him; but love, serve, and honour him, in whose hand all blessings are. 1709.</P>
<P>It is also seriously advised, that no friends suffer romances, play-books, or other vain and idle pamphlets, in their houses or families, which tend to cor∣rupt the minds of youth; but, instead thereof, that they excite them to the reading the Holy Scriptures, and other religious books. Let the Holy Scriptures be early taught our youth, diligently searched, and seriously read by friends, with due regard to the Holy Spirit from whence they came, and by which they are truly opened: For they contain excellent doctrine, rules and precepts, divine and moral. 1720.</P>
<P>And, dear friends, inasmuch as the Holy Scriptures are the external means of conveying and preserving to us an account of the things most surely to be believed concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ in the flesh, and the fulfilling the prophesies relating thereto; we therefore recommend to all friends, especially elders in the church, and masters of families <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> they would, both by example and advice, impress on the minds of the younger <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> reverent esteem of those sacred writings, and advise them to a frequen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and meditating therein; and that you would, at proper times and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, when you find your minds rightly disposed thereunto, give the youth to under∣stand,
<PB N="130" REF="019014_0111_0FA95E59CBE72A38"/>that the same good experience of the work of sanctification, through the operations of the Spirit of God, which the Holy Scriptures plentifully bear testimony to, is to be witnessed by believers in all generations, as well as by those in the first ages of Christianity; in which case some account of our own experience will be helpful to them; and this we recommend as the most ef∣fectual means of begetting and establishing in their minds a firm belief of the Christian doctrine in general, as well as the necessity of the aid and help of the operations of the Holy Spirit of God in the hearts of men in particular, con∣tained in that most excellent book the Bible; and for the preserving them from being defiled with the many pernicious notions and principles, contrary to such sound doctrine, which are at this time industriously dispersed in this country, to the reproach of the Christian profession in general. 1728.</P>
<P>And in order to render these advices more effectual, we further tenderly recommend to all heads of families, that they do frequently call their chil∣dren and servants together; and, in a solemn way, audibly read, or cause to be read, the Holy Scriptures; and in so doing that they humbly wait upon God with their families, for instruction and counsel to them respecting Christian faith and practice, according to the former advices of this meeting.</P>

<P>FORASMUCH as our religious meetings are to be attended for the honour and worship of our Almighty Creator, the promotion and en∣largement of our own peace, and good example to others; it is an incumbent duty of every member of our society reverently to attend them; waiting for and obeying the measure of grace and light received; such therefore who so far neglect their duty herein as to sleep, or by nodding or bowing the head, or other apparent signs of sleep, reproach themselves, bring a burthen on the faithful, and dishonour the truth, are to be treated tenderly with for their recovery; and if, after due waiting and admonition in meekness and wis∣dom, any shall continue in so disreputable and dishonourable a practice, they be not employed nor active in any calling, business or appointment of society, until an overcoming be witnessed, to the satisfaction of the brethren: And if he or she be such as have usually sat facing the meeting, whether minister, elders or others, they withdraw from such seats, that their ill example and re∣proach may be lessened, and take their seats with the members at large, un∣til they and friends are sensible of an overcoming the sin that thus easily besets them.

<HEAD>SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS.</HEAD>
<P>THE excessive use of spirituous liquors, of all kinds, having for a long time been seen by our society to be a practice tending to lead from calmness and innocency, to the many evils which are the consequences of intemperance; and a concern having arose for the spreading of this testimony, not only to the disuse of distilled spirituous liquors among us, except as medicine, but that others also may by our example be encouraged to restrain its use within the limits of truth: We recommend to all friends every where, carefully to look at the motives of being concerned therewith, not only of using but distilling, importing, trading in or handing out to others, who from habit may have acquired a thirst and inclination after it, tending to their hurt. We tenderly advise all such as are concerned therein, to center down to the principle leading to universal righteousness; and as we appre∣hend a continuance in such practices will, in this day of light, weaken the hands not only of those individuals concerned to further the reformation, but tend greatly to obstruct society from holding up a standard to this important testimony, as becometh our holy profession.</P>
<P>We entreat therefore those who have began well, and made advances in the way towards their own peace, that as soon as may be they forbear the said practices, that a line may in due time be drawn, and the standard raised and spread to the nations. 1784.</P>

<HEAD>SPORTS and GAMING.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED that such be dealt with as run races, either on horseback or on foot; or otherwise lay wagers, or use any kind of gaming, or needless and vain sports or pastime: For our time swiftly passeth away; and our pleasure and delight ought to be in the law of the Lord. 1719.</P>
<P>And friends are advised against attending such places, on any account.</P>

<P>AGREED that a collection be occasionally made for defraying the expences of society, and that it be lodged in the hands of a treasurer to be annually appointed, and subject to be drawn out for the service of truth, by the meeting for sufferings, who are to account for the same; the treasurer's accounts to be audited annually by a committee, to be from time to time appointed for that purpose.</P>
<P>The sums which may be thought necessary to be raised, is agreed to be proportioned to each quarter by their representatives present, from time to time; and each quarterly-meeting is desired to be punctual in sending up the same accordingly.</P>

<HEAD>SUFFERINGS.</HEAD>
<P>UPON consideration of sufferings in general, it is advised that in cases of difficulty, and where friends who are sufferers stand in need of advice in any particular case, they send up their respective cases to the meet∣ing for sufferings. 1682.</P>
<P>That friends be careful of entangling themselves in law, because of some small irregularity in the proceeding; but if the law be materially transgressed, and the severity of it exceeded by the persecutor, that friends use their free∣dom, upon serious and good advice among themselves, so as the testimony of truth may be kept clear over all. 1676.</P>

<HEAD>TESTIMONIES and MEMORIALS.</HEAD>
<P>IT is recommended to the quarterly and monthly-meetings, to appoint suitable friends to collect memorials of the living services and dying say∣ings of ministers, elders and other friends, whose lives are remarkable for true piety and faithfulness; with the time of their birth and death as near as may be, with a distinction between ministers, elders and others, and where they lived; and that such collections be inspected by each quarterly and monthly-meeting, and from thence send them up to this meeting, to be again inspected by a committee, and when approved by this meeting to be here recorded. 1760.</P>
<P>It is the judgment of this meeting, that it may be best to read all testimo∣nies of denial in a public meeting, except monthly-meetings consider the person or persons disowned to have lived such lives that they have not been deemed members among friends, by people not of our society; or unless it shall appear, to the satisfaction of the monthly-meeting, such publication may be injurious to the cause of truth: That acknowledgments from persons restor∣ed be published, so far as in best wisdom the monthly-meetings may judge proper.</P>

<HEAD>TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>ADVISED that none launch into trading, and worldly business, beyond what they can manage honourably and with reputation; so that they may keep their words with all men, that their yea may prove yea indeed, and their nay, nay; for whatsoever is otherwise cometh of evil; and that they use few words in their dealings, lest they bring dishonour to God through their forwardness; and such as make themselves guilty, by thus dishonouring God, and the holy profession of his name and truth, are for judgment, and the judgment of truth ought to be set over them, that those who walk and abide in the truth may be clear of their iniquities. 1675, 1688.</P>
<P>It is advised, and earnestly desired, that the payment of just debts be not delayed by any professing truth, beyond the time promised and agreed upon; nor occasion given of complaint to those they deal with, by their backward∣ness of payment, where no time is limited; nor any to overcharge themselves with too much trading, or with business beyond their capacities and abilities to manage in the truth.</P>
<P>It is the advice of this meeting, to the several quarterly-meetings, that care may be taken, that substantial friends be appointed to visit every family amongst us, where they think there is occasion to suspect they are going backwards in their worldly estate, in a manner that may be to the ill example of others, or prejudice of creditors; and to enquire and see how things are with them, advise them in tenderness according to our discipline; and if they do not manifest a disposition to take such advice, and comply with it, then to give them gospel order, and proceed therein against them.</P>
<P>And, dear friends, this meeting being under an holy care and deep concern, for the glory of God, the honour of our holy profession, and safety and
<PB N="144" REF="019014_0119_0FA95E6220101588"/>growth of every member of the body; do advise and counsel all friends, for their own good, that they keep to such lawful and honest employments as they well understand, and are able to manage, for a necessary support of themselves and families; and not to launch out beyond their abilities, espe∣cially upon such credit as truth may have given them with their brethren or others, and more at their hazard who trust them than their own, which is not only a dishonour to truth, but dishonest as men, and such cannot be owned in such things to have place in the body. 1710.</P>
<P>Advised that such be dealt with as trade by sea or land, or buy, bargain or contract, beyond their abilities; and such as keep not their words, pro∣mises or engagements, in their dealings; and do not pay or satisfy their just debts, according to time agreed on. These being a reproach to truth, and a manifest injury and injustice, advice to all such should be speedily given, and if they do not reclaim, amend and duly answer, they are to be further proceeded against. 1719.</P>
<P>It is earnestly desired, that all friends every where be very careful to avoid all inordinate pursuits after the things of this world, by such ways and means as depend too much upon the uncertain probabilities of hazardous enter∣prizes; but rather labour to content themselves with such a plain way and manner of living, as is most agreeable to the self-denying principle of truth which we profess, and which is most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ducive to that tranquility of mind that is requisite to a religious conduct through this troublesome world. 1724.</P>
<P>Advised that a conscientious care dwell on all our minds, not only to be just in our trade and dealing, neither deceiving the buyer in what we sell, or falsifying the balances; but that we keep to our promises, and pay our debts in due time; not exceeding our circumstances or reasonable expectations in our way of living, nor engaging in hazardous things more out of vanity than necessity. And it is our advice, when any professing truth finds himself not able to comply with his contracts, that he call his creditors, and declare his condition in time, and by shewing the honesty of his intentions may clear the
<PB N="145" REF="019014_0120_0FA95E62CC9BF378"/>society from any scandalous imputations; and where any so circumstanced refuses to do so, let him be duly censured. And, on the other hand, we are to remind you to take heed and beware of covetousness; this grand enemy of the love and faith of Jesus being too apt to prevail in this time and place of outward tranquility, wherein we are a people signally blessed of God. 1737.</P>
<P>It is the sense and judgment of this meeting, that no persons who shall fail of paying their just debts ought to be admitted to act in meetings for business, or join with friends in collecting for the poor and the service of the church, until they have made satisfaction to the monthly-meeting they belong to, and done what is in their power to take off the reproach they have, by their imprudent conduct, brought on our Christian principle. 1737.</P>
<P>We are also engaged to caution every individual against imprudently enter∣ing into joint securities with others; for, by these practices, many innocent wives and children have been inevitably and unexpectedly involved in ruinous and deplorable circumstances. We therefore earnestly desire friends to keep strictly on their guard, that none, through any specious pretences of rendering acts of friendship to others with safety to themselves, may risque their own peace and reputation, and the security of their families: In order hereunto, we recommend this salutary advice of the wise man to their especial notice and regard: <Q>Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are sureties for debts. If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed from under thee?</Q> Prov. xxii. 26, 27. 1771.</P>
<P>It is earnestly recommended, that friends frequently inspect the state of their affairs, and frequently settle their accounts; and when any find them∣selves unable or have not more than sufficient to pay their just debts, that they immediately disclose their circumstances to some judicious friends, or principal creditors, and take their advice how to act, and be particularly careful not to pay one creditor in preference to another. 1782.</P>

<HEAD>WAR.</HEAD>
<P>WE have as a people looked upon ourselves, as well as the primitive Christians, to be included in the notable prophecy, Isai. ii. 4, <Q>They shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into prun∣ing-hooks, and learn war no more;</Q> agreeable to the doctrine of our blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ and his apostles (to which our ancient friends abundantly bore testimony, both in doctrine and practice, and suffered deeply for, confirmed and ratified by several of our yearly-meetings, particu∣larly in the years 1693 and 1730, by their express declarations and testimo∣nies against carrying guns, for defending our ships, persons, and goods) and being under many strong engagements to observe the same, from the particu∣lar care of Providence over such as have been faithful to this our testimony, particularly those of our friends in Pennsylvania; nevertheless some, profes∣sing to be of our society, have slighted and neglected this our ancient and Christian testimony, to that degree as to be concerned in privateering, or as owners of ships going as letters of marque, which is a flagrant and lamenta∣ble departure from our peaceable principle, which hath always been to con∣fide in the protection and Providence of Almighty God, and not in weapons of war; which practice of theirs may be attended with injustice, barbarity and bloodshed.</P>
<P>This meeting having taken this sorrowful and afflicting case, and breach of our ancient testimony, into our serious consideration, have thought it our in∣cumbent duty to bear our testimony against such practices; and it is the unani∣mous sense of this meeting, that all quarterly and monthly-meetings ought speedily to deal with every person found in the practice of such things, in the spirit of truth and love, in order to bring them to a sense of their error, and
<PB N="148" REF="019014_0122_0FA95E66E8B50158"/>to reclaim them from it; which if they cannot do, then to testify against them, and let them know we have no unity or fellowship with them. 1744.</P>
<P>We are sorrowfully affected, by the answers to the Queries, that some friends have failed in the maintenance of our Christian testimony against wars and fighting, by joining with others to hire substitutes, and by the payment of money to exempt themselves from personal service, in the militia; a practice inconsistent with the testimony to the reign of the Prince of Peace our ancients received, and were concerned to maintain through cruel sufferings, and which the faithful in this day dare not shrink from: Which defection from our Christian testimony and general practice having been matter of sorrow to this meeting, we are concerned strongly to advise against, and that friends every where stand faithful and single in their dependence on the Lord for preser∣vation, who alone is forever able to keep in perfect safety. And if suffering be the lot which doth result from such obedience to the divine requiring, such will, as they abide in the simplicity and innocence of truth, reap the fruits of peace in their own bosom. Let therefore the care of friends, in their several monthly-meetings, be exerted to prevent any contributions for hiring substitutes, or other methods of exempting themselves from the militia, in∣con<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>istent with our well-known testimony. 1760.</P>
<P>It is our sense and judgment, that we cannot, consistent with our well-known principles, actively pay any rate or assessment on any town or class of men which may be imposed, for not raising the quotas or number assigned them to raise for any military purpose; whether it be as a fine for neglect, or an equivalent for such quotas or detachment; nor any rates or assessments made for the advancing of the hire or inlisting-money of volunteers, or which may be expressly therein ordered to be given or paid to military men. 1762.</P>
<P>We advise that all friends carefully avoid censuring or judging each other, in respect to the payment or non-payment of such taxes, a part whereof goes to the support of war, and a part for civil government.</P>
<P>And it is recommended to friends every where, to take into their serious consideration the inconsistency of any under our profession suffering their
<PB N="149" REF="019014_0123_0FA95E6890D9EF30"/>temporal interest to induce them in any manner to contribute to the purposes of war.</P>
<P>It is the concern of this meeting to recommend to the several monthly-meetings, that they, consistent with our ancient testimony, refuse the pay∣ment of all taxes, expressly or specially for the support of war, whether called for in money, provisions or otherwise; and that accounts of distraints for such taxes be sent up; and that such friends as do actively pay such taxes be dealt with as disorderly walkers. We also desire, that all friends carefully avoid discouraging a tender scruple which may arise in the minds of our brethren respecting the payment of such taxes, a part whereof is evidently for the support of war; and that all be careful to manifest, by a steady consistent conduct, that they singly aim to experience an advancement in the truth. 1781.</P>

<HEAD>WOMENS MEETINGS.</HEAD>
<P>OUR womens meetings being set up and approved in the love of God, and by his wisdom and power; and being of manifest service, and helpful in the church; it is the earnest desire and advice of this meeting, that they may be upheld and encouraged. 1707.</P>
<P>And in order that the service of womens meetings may be the more exten∣sive, it is recommended that each monthly-meeting of women friends depute representatives to attend the service of their quarterly-meetings; and each quarterly-meeting depute representatives to the yearly-meeting.</P>
<P>That they proceed in answering the queries, appointing all the proper offi∣cers, and conducting the business necessary to their meetings, as the mens meetings are advised under queries, monthly-meetings, quarterly-meetings and yearly-meetings.</P>
<P>In regard to the matter of men and womens meetings being united in disowning and receiving members, it is agreed, when any person requests the care of friends, and when any friend is taken under dealing in any monthly-meeting, such meeting, whether mens or womens, acquaint the other thereof, in order for their uniting their sympathy, and help, if they think it best; and when the meeting to whom application is made, or by whom the friend may be under dealing, are about to receive, restore or dis∣own the person under care, that both meetings be acquainted therewith, and their concurrence or unity manifested before the conclusion be entered; and when the approbation of both men and women be obtained, the same be entered on the minutes of each meeting.</P>
<P>And it is advised, that men and women be attentive and ready in their monthly and quarterly-meetings to unite their assistance to each other, when it appears useful and best, whether expressly desired or not; and that testimo∣nies of denial be read, approved and minuted, in both meetings, and then be signed by the clerk of the mens meeting, if respecting a man, and if a woman, by the clerk of the womens meeting.</P>

<HEAD>YEARLY-MEETING.</HEAD>
<P>THE good and blessed intent and end of this and all our assemblies is, with the Lord's assistance, for his honour, in the promoting and main∣taining of our Christian society and religion, in life and practice, in all the parts and branches thereof. 1695.</P>
<P>It is the fervent desire of this meeting, that the business and concerns there∣of be solidly, in the fear of God, managed and carried on, without contention or striving; and with as few words, and in as pertinent expressions to the matter in hand, as may be, for expediting the affairs thereof without loss of time, or any ways disordering the meeting; but one at a time speaking, and standing up, that all things may be done decently, and in good order. 1710.</P>
<P>That the quarterly-meetings be careful annually to depute such friends to attend the service of the yearly-meeting, as are men fearing God, of good conversation, weighty spirits, prudent and sincere, well acquainted with the affairs of truth, and diligent attenders of meetings for discipline at home; whose practice and conversation is answerable to the testimony they profess to bear; men known to be faithful and conscientious. 1714, 1733.</P>
<P>Advised that no representatives withdraw from the meeting before it ends, without leave first requested and granted, that the service of the meeting may not be neglected. 1709.</P>
<P>It behoveth us, in all such our assemblies, to have our minds seasoned with a sense of the weight of the work we are engaged in, and to exert ourselves with an holy zeal for the cause of God, and the promotion of his truth; care∣fully watching against an exalted spirit, which would strive for mastery and dominion, labouring in love and meekness of wisdom to be helpful one unto another, that <Q>Nothing may be done through strife, or vain-glory; but, in
<PB N="154" REF="019014_0126_0FA95E6A5FA4B928"/>lowliness of mind, let each esteem other better than themselves.</Q> Phil. ii. 3. 1747.</P>
<P>Agreed that at the close of the yearly-meeting for worship all the repre∣sentatives retire, and agree upon a clerk for the present year; and when the meeting of business is entered by the former clerk, or in his absence the clerk of the meeting for sufferings, the clerk named by the representatives being approved is to be entered, and then to take his seat at the table, and proceed on the business before the meeting.</P>
<P>Agreed that all papers that come before this meeting, as well as quarterly and monthly-meetings, except such as are from immediate correspondents, be first examined by a committee, to be from time to time appointed, before they be read up in our meetings.</P>

<HEAD>YOUTH.</HEAD>
<P>WE earnestly beseech our friends, and especially the youth among us, to avoid all such couversation as may tend to draw out their minds into the foolish and wicked pastimes with which this age aboundeth (par∣ticularly balls, gaming-places, horse-races, and play-houses) those nurseries of debauchery and wickedness, the burthen and grief of the sober part of other societies, as well as of our own; practices wholly unbecoming a people under the Christian profession, contrary to the tenor of the doctrine of the gospel, and the examples of the best men in the earliest ages of the church. For as "Evil communications corrupt good manners," so it is the duty of men professing religion, who live in this world in order to obtain a better, not only to <Q>Shake their hands from holding of bribes, and stop their ears from hearing of blood,</Q> but also "to shut their eyes from seeing of evil." Isai. xxxiii. 15. 1739.</P>
<P>And dearly beloved youth, in an humble sense of the continued visitations of the Father's love, and experience of their blessed effects, we entreat you, by the mercies of God receive its holy impressions, submit to its discipline; this will preserve you from the deplorable effect of Satan's transformations, inspire you with holy resolutions, and enable you to maintain them in all godly conversation, and purity of life and faith, adorning the doctrine of the gospel by a blameless demeanour. True peace will then flow as a river in your own minds; and the fruits of the tree of righteousness be brought forth to your inexpressible consolation in Christ, the revival of Zion's beauty, the rebuilding of her desolations; so that, by and through you, she may yet appear beautiful to the sincere-hearted, but to her enemies terrible as an army with banners. 1751.</P>
