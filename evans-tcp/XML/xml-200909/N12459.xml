<HEAD>SOME NECESSARY REMARKS ON THE EDUCATION OF THE YOUTH <HI>in the</HI> COUNTRY-PARTS <HI>of this, and the neighbouring</HI> GOVERNMENTS.</HEAD>
<P>THAT the religious and civil education of our young people is an affair of the great∣est importance, as it not only concerns the hap∣piness of individuals, but the welfare and pro∣sperity of Society, all are ready to acknowledge; but when we cast our eyes over the country and consider the little attention and pains employed therein, we must allow that people either do
<PB N="2" REF="015739_0002_0F9A2346EF5B3AE0"/>
not speak as they think, or that what they mean by education, is something else than to qualify their children to be useful and service∣able in life; and to fit them for eternal happi∣ness. If the boy be designed for any of the learned professions, inquiry is made for a ma∣ster to teach him Latin; but if he be only de∣signed for the common offices of life, it is thought sufficient that he be taught to read and write, with a little arithmetick, and that often but very imperfectly; no matter by whom, but the cheaper the better. Thus it happens that persons, every way, unqualified, both in learning and morals, are, for the sake of hav∣ing it done cheaper, entrusted with the educa∣tion of children; by which means, the youth are deprived of learning, and instead of im∣proving in virtue, which ought to be the main design of instruction, rather become proficients in vice. For, it is an undoubted truth, con∣firmed by fatal experience, that children catch the vices of those with whom they converse, and that impressions made on their tender minds are deep and lasting. The love we owe to God our great and good Creator, good will to men, a strict regard to truth; a government of their appetites and passions, should be, as much as possible, enforced on the youth <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The chief aim of instruction pointed out by the Gospel and enforced by the wise men of every age and nation was the amendment of the heart: The Lacedemonians and Persians accounted ingratitude a crime, whoever was ever capable of forgetting a benefit was looked upon as the enemy of mankind.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="015739_0003_0F9A2347AD78ABB8"/>If we really wish to see our children grow up in virtue and knowledge, and qualified to be useful members of Society, the means must be procured, to which it is to be hoped, that those who have not, as well as those who have children, would cheerfully contribute, without regard to any immediate advantage, they are to reap; virtuous persons qualified for so weigh∣ty an employment must be sought for: And in order that this may be done upon a lasting bottom, where the establishment of a School is necessary, a fund should be raised, which thro' the divine blessing, by donations, legacies, &amp;c. may become a lasting settlement; a lot of ground should be provided, sufficient for a garden, orch∣ard, grass for a cow, &amp;c. a house, stables, &amp;c. erected thereon: There are few neighbour∣hoods, but may, in money from the rich, and materials and labour from others, contribute so much as will answer this charge; such a settle∣ment, with a reasonable Salary, will be an en∣couragement to a sober person, with a family, who will be likely to spend his life in the ser∣vice; such an one, from the experience he will gain, will be much more likely to answer the good end proposed, than such transient persons as are often employed. Indeed the illjudged custom which has generally prevailed with the country people, of hiring a single person, on account of cheapness, and for the sake of board∣ing him, amongst themselves, is attended with many inconveniences. These are frequently persons of no stability, and little principle, who engage in that service, for a present mainten∣ance,
<PB N="4" REF="015739_0004_0F9A23486EDF7B30"/>
which they are ready to quit, when ever something more agreeable to their interest or humour offers; so that, they have as little desire as opportunity, of gaining that necessary ex∣perience, which, nothing will so effectually give, as a serious and steady practice.</P>
<P>It is a most absurd piece of thrift, for the sake of adding 40, or 50 pounds to a child's fortune, to deprive him of the benefit of a pro∣per education, for only to consider it in the light of prudence, the child, if well instructed, will readily save or gain that much more; and, if taught wherein true happiness consists, he will never repine at the want of that small sum; but to a person unprincipled in virtue, or cor∣rupted with evil habits, what is 40 or 50 pounds more or less? Nay, does not daily experience shew us that the greatest wealth often answers little or no other purpose, than to adminster to folly, luxury, and debauchery; to inflame the passions of the youth, and give a wider range to their licentiousness.</P>
<P>And, in order that this necessary service should be managed to the best advantage, a number of persons the best qualified, and able to attend the service, should be chosen, to take upon them the care and oversight of the School; to advise and assist the master; and to be especially careful, that the children of the poor be encouraged to attend, and be admitted, free of cost. And the masters and overseers are exhorted, and en∣treated, not to repine or grudge any labour they may bestow in this good service, beyond what has been usual; but remember, they are promoting the purposes of our good Creator, whose will is the happiness of his creatures, who is able and willing to repay even a cup of cold water given in his name; and the comfort it will
<PB N="5" REF="015739_0005_0F9A23492FCD3690"/>
in future afford them to reflect, that they have in some measure, been the happy instruments in laying the foun∣dation for making the youth serviceable and happy here, and of promoting their eternal happiness hereafter.</P>
<P>The following advices are submitted to the considera∣tion of those overseers and Tutors who may be ap∣pointed to the care of such Schools.</P>
<P N="1">1st. That in teaching English, particular care should be taken to make children spell correctly, by exercis∣ing them, frequently, in that necessary branch of their learning.</P>
<P N="2">2d. That endeavours be used to make the Scholars read with proper emphasis and punctuation, to which purpose it will be also necessary, besides the Bible to make use of Historical and Religious Authors, of which the School ought to be furnished with proper setts.</P>
<P N="3">3d. That such parts of Grammer as are applicable to the English tongue, be taught those boys who are fit for it, in order to make them write properly, but that they be as little as possible, perplexed with such nice distinctions, as have no foundation in the nature of our language.</P>
<P N="4">4th. That the Master as often as is convenient make a practice of dictating, to such Scholars who write tolerably well, some sentence out of some good Author which they are to write after him; then the Master carefully correct it, making such Grammatick and Orthographic remarks as are necessary: This the Scholar must write over in his Book, which being again reviewed by the Master and the remaining omis∣sions noted, may be copied in the neatest manner on the opposite page. Some modern Grammarians also pro∣pose, that the Tutors give their scholars some portion of History, &amp;c. expressed in false Orthography, Gram∣mar, &amp;c. which they with the help of a Dictionary and some general Grammatic Rules must make out as cor∣rect as they can, which after being submitted to the Tutor's Remarks and Correction, should be neatly copied over in their writing Books. These methods if carefully pursued will much help their diction; improve
<PB N="6" REF="015739_0006_0F9A2349EDAC0C10"/>
their spelling; teach them to copy correctly; and in some measure supply the want of Classical Learning</P>
<P N="5">5th. That in writing care be taken to promote a strong free hand, which will be of most common use, and from which all other hands may be easily formed. And that the Master be particularly careful to make the pu∣pils sit in right positions at their writing and that they hold their pen properly, on this their perfection in writing very much depends.</P>
<P N="6">6th. That in teaching Arithmetick it be recommend∣ed to the master to give in the first place the most plain and practical rules; leaving those that are abstruce and not generally necessary, to boys of the brightest genius, or leisure.</P>
<P N="7">7th. That a small, but very plain set of Merchants Accompt Books, <HI>viz.</HI> a Day Book, or Journal and Ledger be provided, just sufficient to make the Scholars acquainted with the nature of the most plain entries of Debtor and Creditor; that they not only be made to copy these, in a neat and correct manner, but that the master use his best endeavours that they be made to un∣derstand the reason of what they are doing.</P>
<P N="8">8th. That no latin be attempted to be taught, unless a School should be erected solety for that purpose: The teaching that language, in an English School, infallibly consuming more of the masters time, than can be spared from his other business; and the few Latin-Scholars must be very indifferently attended</P>
<P N="9">9th. That some method be thought of for limiting the number of scholars, so that the master be not over-prest, in some seasons of the year; and that the poor be properly considered.</P>
<P>That such Rules, or Orders as may be thought ne∣cessary, be provided and set up in some public place in the School; and that the master be enjoined to require strict obedience to every one of them.</P>
<P>The following Rules of conduct to scholars extracted, from those used in some of the schools in Philadelphia, are proposed to the consideration of overseers, and tu∣tors, to be improved and added to, as their experience and situation may make necessary.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="7" REF="015739_0007_0F9A234C07198910"/>1st. Fail not to be at school precisely at the time appointed; unless good reason can be assigned to the master.</P>
<P N="2">2d. Be always silent at your studies, so that your voices be not heard, unless when saying your lessons, or speaking to your master: Hold no discourse with your school-fellows, during the time of study, unless to ask something relating to your learning and then in a low voice.</P>
<P N="3">3d. Make all your speeches to your master with due respect; observing cheerfully his directions, according to your abilities.</P>
<P N="4">4th. Behave yourselves always in a gentle, obliging manner, to your school-fellows; tenderly affectionate, never provoking one another; contending nor complain∣ing about frivolous matters; but courteously use kind expressions one towards the other; observing to make some grateful return for any little kindness received.</P>
<P N="5">5th. Be not forward to divulge any thing passed in school, nor to mock, or jeer your school fellows for being corrected; it is unkind, and may happen to be your own case.</P>
<P N="6">6th. Never tell a lie, or use artful evasions, nor de∣fraud any person, by word or deed: Swear not at all; nor use the name of God irreverently, or in vain: Mock not the aged, the lame, deformed or insane. Throw no sticks, stones, dirt, snowballs, or any other thing at any person, or creature: Revile no person; nor utter any indecent expressions: Never return any injury or affront; but forgive, agreeable to the posi∣tive injunction given us in the Lord's prayer, To for∣give as we desire to be forgiven, and the Apostle's ad∣vice. <HI>That we forgive one another, even as God, for Christ's sake, has forgiven us;</HI> but in all things to the best of your power, behave in a modest, civil, and complai∣sant manner to all.</P>
<P>At Home. Before you rise from your beds, observe to look up to your Creator, offering a mental petition to Him for help and protection, during the course of the day.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="015739_0008_0F9A234C2DC47228"/>Observe, cheerfully, and readily, to comply with your parent's commands; always addressing them with ho∣nour and respect, remembering the blessing annexed, in the third commandment, to the duty of honouring your Parents.</P>
<P>Treat your Brothers and Sisters with affection and good manners; and, in like manner, behave to the mea∣nest Servant; with kindness using the word <HI>please,</HI> &amp;c. where proper; that your good example may induce them so to behave to you: Join not in their idle talk or jesting; but choose the company of persons, whose con∣versation is most improving in the best things.</P>
<P>Be not forward to sit down at table before your elders; when seated be not eager to fall to your victuals, like the brute beast; but first make a solemn pause, en∣deavouring to retire in your minds, in thankfulness to the supreme giver of them. Dont offer to carve or ask for yourselves, but wait till you are served; find no fault with your food; but having eaten moderately, rise from table, without noise, unless desired to stay.</P>
<P>At places of Worship, Observe to be present at the times appointed, entering the place soberly, so as not to disturb the meditations of those that are met: Sit in a decent composure of body and mind, putting up your petitions to your heavenly Father, with an humble re∣verend disposition; requesting to be enabled to offer him spiritual and acceptable worship. When worship is over rise not up in a hurry, nor be impatient to be gone, but respectfully pass along without pressing, and return decently home.</P>
