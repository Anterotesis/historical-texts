<P>THESE are some of the <HI>Voices of the Prophets</HI> concerning the Messiah, which the <HI>Jews</HI> were then looking for: And why did not they re∣ceive him, when he so exactly answered these Descriptions? The Answer is plain in the Text; therefore we proceed:</P>
<P N="2">II. To consider the Reason why they did not receive him, though they had so often heard these plain Predictions; which was, <HI>Because they knew him not, nor the Voices of the Prophets;</HI> 'twas their Ignorance of GOD and his Word.</P>
<P>BUT were they really ignorant? Why it seems that they knew so much about the Time of the Messiah's coming, that they were in great Ex∣pectation of him about that Season: They knew that he was to be the Son of <HI>David;</HI> and could tell <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d</HI> that he was to be born in <HI>Bethlehem</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> iii. 15. <HI>Mat.</HI> ii. 5, and xxii. 42.</NOTE>. And they expected that he would be a great Deliverer and Saviour of their People: But their Misery was that they were ignorant of the <HI>spi∣ritual Nature</HI> of these great Things. <HI>They knew him not;</HI> were ignorant of the Nature and Per∣fections of the Deity. They had not learnt
<PB N="9" REF="009330_0008_1030EDB4666AE660"/>
what <HI>Joshua</HI> taught their Fathers, <HI>viz. Ye can∣not serve the Lord<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for he is an holy God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Josh.</HI> xxiv. 19.</NOTE>. Nor had such a View of his Holiness as <HI>Isaiah,</HI> which made him cry out, <HI>Wo is me, for I am undone, because I am a Man of unclean Lips, and I dwell in the midst of a People of unclean Lips: For mine Eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts.</HI> And he had a living Application from off GOD'S Altar, to <HI>purge away his Sin,</HI> in order to his going forth on GOD'S Errand<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Isa.</HI> vi.</NOTE>. No, they did not think their standing to be such before GOD, but that if they had good Instructions, and good Motives, they might obtain Salvation, without supernatural Help: Hence one of them that discovered a high Esteem of <HI>Christ,</HI> and came kneeling to him; his Inquiry was, <HI>What shall I</HI> DO <HI>that I may inherit eternal Life?</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> x. 17.</NOTE> The <HI>Jews</HI> had such an Opinion of their Doings, that they did not believe that they needed an Almighty Helper, and therefore stumbled at his asserting his Godhead: And I have often thought that one ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Reason why any in these Times deny <HI>Christ</HI>'s Divinity, is because they don't see their Case to be so wretched as to want an infinite Saviour.</P>
<P>FURTHER, they knew not the <HI>Voices of the Prophets;</HI> though they read much in the Pro∣phets Writings, they did not understand their Meaning; but formed earthly Conceptions of heavenly Things. Thus, for Instance, when they read of <HI>Christ</HI>'s coming as the King of
<PB N="10" REF="009330_0009_1030EDB797FDA5B8"/>
<HI>Israel▪</HI> they looked for one that would deliver them from their outward Enemies, and raise their Nation above all the Kingdoms round about: Hence the <HI>Pharisees</HI> demanded of <HI>Jesus, When the Kingdom of God should come?</HI> But he replied, <HI>The Kingdom of God cometh not with Ob∣servation; neither shall they say lo here, or lo there</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> xvii. 20, 21.</NOTE>. i. e. GOD'S Kingdom comes not with outward Show, like earthly one's, that Observers might say, Lo here comes our King with his Retinue, or there he appears in his Glory. No says our Saviour, <HI>For behold the Kingdom of God is within you.</HI> His Kingdom is of an inward and spiritual Nature.</P>
<P>THE Evangelist <HI>John</HI> sets the Case in a very clear Light; he shews that when <HI>Jesus</HI> came to his own People, they received him not: But those which did receive him, were those, <HI>Which were born not of Blood, nor of the Will of the Flesh, nor of the Will of Man, but of God.</HI> They being divinely enlightened, <HI>beheld his Glory, the Glory as of the only-begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Truth</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Joh.</HI> i. 11, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>14.</NOTE>. While others who were trust∣ing in their <HI>Blood</HI> Relation to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and in their <HI>free Will</HI> Power, saw no Form nor Comli∣ness in him. Thus it appears, that their Igno∣rance of the Nature and Perfections of the Di∣vine Being, and consequently of their own un∣likeness to him, and wretched Condition before him; and so not being sensible of what a Sal∣vation they needed, was the great Cause of their
<PB N="11" REF="009330_0010_1030EDBC687ABF48"/>
rejecting, and crucifying the Lord of Glory. Now in these Things, they were willingly, nay, many of them wilfully ignorant, by which they brought upon themselves dreadful Guilt and amazing Ruin: Which shocking Example was justly set forth by the Apostle, as a Warning to the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Antioch,</HI> not to do the like; and it ought likewise seriously to be regarded by each of our Souls: Which may lead us to some par∣ticular Improvement of the Hints that have been given. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. How should these Things teach us to prize and regard the holy Scriptures? In them alone is clearly discovered how we have de∣stroyed ourselves, and where our Help is found. The Author, the Nature, and the Glory of our Salvation is there revealed, as the Light of Na∣ture, and all the Wisdom of this World could never have found it out. And as these good News are glorious in themselves; so they are to be depended upon by us. Nothing confirms Prophecy like the exact Accomplishment of the Things predicted. This was the ancient Rule which GOD gave to <HI>Israel,</HI> to know his Prophets by<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> xviii. 22.</NOTE>. O, how convincing then are the Evidences that we have of the Verity of the Bible! None but Men divinely inspired could tell Hundreds, or Thousands of Years before Hand, so many great Things; yea, and minute Circumstances too, concerning the Birth, Life and Death of our Saviour, as were written by

Such Behaviour is like running upon the Point of a Sword, to which GOD'S Word is frequently compared.

<P>THE Necessity and Importance of the Help of the Divine Spirit, may further appear from two Considerations.</P>
<P>FIRST. From the Imperfection of the Ideas which we form concerning Things that we are
<PB N="14" REF="009330_0013_1030EDC66C08DB90"/>
not acquainted with. How rarely do any Per∣son<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ad Places, Persons or Things to agree with the Conceptions which they have formed of them from verbal or written Descriptions! And if our Apprehensions are so dull about <HI>earthly</HI> Things, that are out of the Circle of our particular Acquaintance; how confused and false will our Notions be of <HI>heavenly</HI> Things, without the Teachings of the <HI>Holy Ghost!</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 11.</NOTE> The Reason why the natural Man cannot know them, is, because they are <HI>spiritually discerned:</HI> The Apostle uses a very striking Similitude to il∣lustrate this Case, <HI>For,</HI> says he, <HI>what Man know∣eth the Things of a Man, save the Spirit of Man which is in him? even so the Things of God knoweth</HI> NO <HI>Men, but the Spirit of God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 11.</NOTE>. Which shews that his Teachings are as needful for the true Knowledge of the Things of GOD, as the Use of our intellectual Powers are in order to be con∣scious of Things within us.</P>
<P>SECONDLY. The Wise give wrong Judgment when their Minds are byased. <HI>A Gift doth blind the Eyes of the Wise, and pervert the Words of the Righteous</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> xvi. 19.</NOTE>. Now Pride, Self Love, Self-Inte∣rest, the Frowns or Favors of the World, and Abundance of other Things, like Fogs, arise often in the Mind to prevent a just View of Things: Nay, says the Apostle <HI>James, Do ye think that the Scripture saith in vain, the Spirit that dwelleth in us lusteth to Envy?</HI> What then is the Remedy against this great Evil? Why,

<P N="3">3. IF the Influences and In-dwelling of the holy Spirit is so needful for all, how essentially necessary must it be for a Gospel Minister? The Teachers of the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church were (at least some of them) Men of no small Capacities and Acquirements: CHRIST calls them the <HI>Wise and prudent</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xi. 23.</NOTE>. But their Hearts not being right with GOD, the greater their Gifts, the more Mischief they did; and so it generally proves to be with such Men, in all Generations.— Among many Things that might be named to illustrate this Point, I shall fix upon this, <HI>viz.</HI> Ministers are <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Ambassadors,</HI> to treat with Souls in his Name about being reconciled to GOD<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 20.</NOTE>. Well, should any Person now, when a Treaty is proposed, to labor for to reconcile the Powers at War, advance this as a Rule, that in making choice of Ambassadors to act for our King and Nation in these great Affairs, that if any Persons can be found who have large Gifts, and are well versed in the Languages, History, and political Affairs of the Nations concerned, then 'tis no essential Thing, whether in Heart they are Friends to our Nation or to its Enemies<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Here note, that I speak nothing against human Learning in itself, but only of the Place some give it; and to use the Comparison that Mr. <HI>Keach</HI> did, eighty Years ago: Human Learning may be a good Hand-maid to Religion; but if like <HI>Hagar,</HI> she must needs be Mistress, then cast her out.</NOTE>. How would such a one be
<PB N="16" REF="009330_0015_1030EDCEA82340D8"/>
looked upon, and treated? I believe I need not answer; others would do it fast enough. And what Reason can be given why supreme Love to <HI>Christ</HI> and his Cause, is not as necessary in his Ambassador as in King <HI>George</HI>'s?</P>
<P>SHOULD it be said that a Person may have a good moral Character, and a Desire to promote others' Salvation, though he be not regenerated himself. I reply, that our Lord declares, that <HI>He that is not with me, is against me; and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat.</HI> xii. 30.</NOTE>. All are either real Friends or Enemies to <HI>Christ,</HI> and those who don't view the Case to be so, have not true Ideas of the Controversy which subsists be∣tween GOD and Man; and therefore are very unfit Persons to have the Ministry of Reconci∣liation committed to them.—But say many, "we can't know who are converted, and who not; for GOD only searcheth the Heart." AN∣SWER. He only sees what the inward Dispositi∣ons of Mens Minds are towards our King and Nation, as well as towards Heaven; but will any argue from thence that we can't know who are our Friends, and who not?—It will likely be reply'd, that indeed we may form a Judg∣ment sufficient to act upon; yet possibly we may be mistaken after all. Well, when that is allowed, still how is it improved? Why, in civil
<PB N="17" REF="009330_0016_1030EDD037EF7928"/>
and political Concerns, the Danger of being imposed upon, makes Men more careful; so that if there are Counterfeits abroad, they don't conclude that they'll take no mo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Money; nor on the other Hand, that they'll take all that comes: No; but they look more critically after the distinguishing Marks of the true Coin: And why will not Men be as wise about Things spi∣ritual and heavenly? I know no better Reason for it than this, <HI>viz.</HI> That Things below have more Place and deeper Influence, generally, on Men's Minds, than Things above. And I wish there was no Reason to complain, even in this Land of Gospel Light, that some who claim the Power of introducing Men into the Mini∣stry; yet neglect even to examine their Candi∣dates whether they are regenerated or no; as though that was so small a Part of their Quali∣fications, that it was not worth inquiring after. <HI>Be astonished O ye Heavens at this!</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. HENCE see something of the Cause why <HI>Jesus</HI> in his spiritual coming, is often treated by many Professors of Christianity, much as his Person was by the <HI>Jews;</HI> namely, because their Eyes are blinded as to the Nature of spiritual Things, so that when GOD appears to work effectually for the Salvation of Souls, they make strange of it, or boldly fight against it; and yet think that they would not appear against a good Work, no more than the <HI>Jews</HI> thought they would in <HI>Christ</HI>'s Time. <HI>Joh.</HI> x. 33.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="009330_0017_1030EDD38BAFED98"/>MANY when they read, that <HI>God hath chosen the foolish Things of the World to confound the Wise,</HI> yea, and the <HI>weak, base</HI> and <HI>despised</HI> Things of the World, hath he chosen to the End, <HI>That no Flesh should g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y in his Presence</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 27, -29.</NOTE>: They readily allow that 'twas right for him to deal thus in those Times, because that the <HI>Jewish</HI> Leaders, and <HI>Gentile</HI> Philosophers, had a very false Con∣ceit of their own Wisdom and Goodness: But they do not suppose any other but that their Opinion of themselves is just, and can't think that <HI>Christ</HI> will make Use of Instruments and Means, now to promote his Cause, which look <HI>foolish, weak</HI> and <HI>despicable</HI> in their Eyes. Just so the <HI>Pharisees</HI> of old looked upon the Conduct of their Fathers. <HI>Mat.</HI> xxiii. 29, -31. Which should be a Warning to us all to beware of Self-Conceit.</P>
<P>PRESIDENT <HI>Edwards</HI> observed twenty Years ago, in his Thoughts which he published, of the Work of GOD then in <HI>New-England,</HI> that the Error of those that opposed the Work (where their Error lay in the Understanding, and not in the Disposition) consisted chiefly in these three Things, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>In their judging of the Work, by the Means and Manner of its being introduced, and not by the Nature of the Work itself.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. <HI>In their not making the Scriptures their only Rule to try it by.</HI> And,</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="19" REF="009330_0018_1030F34D52DB5CB0"/>3. <HI>Their not distinguishing between the Good and the Bad; but condemning All, because they found some Things wrong.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>AND he observes that many make use of History, old Customs, if not their own Expe∣riences too, as Rules to judge of the Work by, instead of the divine Oracles.</P>
<P>THESE Observations I think are undeniable in themselves, and are also as worthy of Notice now, as then; which was one Cause of my setting of them down here; and another was, because of what I have heard and seen of late.</P>
<P>AFTER great Declensions and Stupidity, and the awful prevailing of Iniquity in our Land, the Lord has been pleased in infinite Mercy to revive his Work in various Places<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Particularly in <HI>Middleborough,</HI> and the Borders of some Towns adjoining; where the Work began last <HI>May,</HI> and has prevailed so far, that not less than Threescore have been thought to be converted since then. I am not so un∣acquainted with Mankind as to be insensible how ready many are to say, "You don't know who are converted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>" But, I shall beg Leave to reply, in the Words of the late President <HI>Davies,</HI> when speaking of the Work in, <HI>Virginia, viz.</HI> <Q>I claim no <HI>Infallibility;</HI> but I must, not under the modest Pretence of renouncing it, scruple a Matter attested with all possible Evidences, and so rush into <HI>Scepticism.</HI> If I could form no Judgment of so public a Work, I would renounce my Function this Moment, for with what Face can I pretend to promote a divine Work in the Conversion of Men, if I cannot have any <HI>satisfying</HI> Knowledge of it, when it appears.</Q>
—State of Dissenters in <HI>Virginia,</HI> p. 28, printed at <HI>Boston,</HI> 1751. Something of the same Work that has been among us, has appeared lately in <HI>R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>obeth, Attl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>borough, Coventry, Norwich, Lyme, Brimfield, Enfield, Saffe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> and some other Places. <HI>January</HI> 7, 1763.</NOTE>: And yet great Numbers both of Ministers and People, treat it either with Disregard, or Opposition; notwithstanding the Evidences of its being a divine Work are such as these: Namely, Many that formerly scarce shewed any Regard to Re∣ligion, and rarely attended public Worship,
<PB N="20" REF="009330_0019_10303213F0F4B700"/>
now rarely neglect any stated or occasional Op∣portunity to hear the Gospel preached; great Numbers of young People who were before bent upon V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ity, now shew more Engagement and Delight in religious Exercises, public and private, than ever they did in their <HI>merry Meet∣ings:</HI>—Some intemperate Persons are become sober and regular in their Conduct; many that were inordinately bent after the World, are brought to lament their Folly in pursuing earthly Things in neglect of heavenly; Numbers which had old Grudges are reconciled, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THOSE who are looked upon to be converted, though many Circumstances of their Change are very various; yet all agree in acknowledging the Purity and Strictness of the divine Law, and that their Hearts as well as Lives have been filled with Sin, and from thence give in to the Justice of GOD in their Condemnation: And hold their Justification to be intirely by <HI>Christ</HI>'s Righteousness, received by Faith: Yet a View of that is so far from making them careless in
<PB N="21" REF="009330_0020_10303216C1F0FE78"/>
their Behaviour, that they discover an earnest Desire to know and conform to all <HI>Christ</HI>'s Com∣mands and Ordinances; they shew much Love to God's People, earnest Concern for the Sal∣vation of Souls, and the like. Indeed I am far from thinking that there has been no Intermix∣ture of Things that are not good; though from the most careful Observations that I have been able to make, I really believe that this Work has been more clear from such Things than the Work was twenty-one Years ago: Particularly, the Impressions that have been made, either of a sor∣rowful or joyful Nature, have been more upon the Understanding, and less on the Imagination, now than then: Hence, I have heard of no <HI>Trances</HI> among us; also, Christians have been more solemn in their Joys, and less bitter in their Zeal, than in the former Work. Nay, the Case is so clear, that I should not be affraid to defy all Men to shew fuller Proofs of that's being the Work of God's Spirit which pre∣vailed then in the Land, than have appeared among us in the Year past; unless they think this to be so, <HI>to wit.</HI> That the Instruments and Subjects of that Work were more accounted of in the World than these now; and if that be the Case, then I would only desire such to look back again upon the <HI>Jews'</HI> Conduct towards CHRIST, and take Warning.</P>
<P>SOME, I know are ready to say, "Don't go so fast, but wait and see how Things will turn out." As if when, <HI>The Day-spring from on high

The <HI>Jews</HI> waited to see how Things would turn out, and what did they find: Why, they see many that followed <HI>Christ</HI> for a While, forsake him? They saw one betray him, and others deny him, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And then they were confirmed that it was all a Delusion; and, O Soul! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ost thou covet their Lot?

O, there∣fore embrace the first Calls without Delay!</P>
<P>ONCE more▪</P>
<P N="5">5. OUR Subject may inform us of one main Reason why Mens Practice often contradicts their Profession; namely, because they are ig∣norant of the Nature of the Principles they profess, or at least don't duly view them in their Conduct. And alas! how full is the World of such Things? I shall name a few Instances.</P>
<P>PROTESTANTS in general, profess that the Scriptures are the only perfect Rule to decide all Controversies; and yet we often find,
<PB N="23" REF="009330_0022_1030EDD8A416F3E0"/>
that when any Principle or old Custom is brought into Dispute, Recourse is pre∣sently had to the old Fathers, and if a Number of good Men on one Side, and bad ones on the other can be reckoned up▪ the Scale is presently turned, and the Point decided. Indeed, I am far from slighting pious Predecessors, but would follow them as far as they did <HI>Christ;</HI> yet to make use of them as Authorities sufficient to shut off any clear Light from the divine Oracles, which they did not see, is really to injure their Characters, as well as our own Souls.</P>
<P>AGAIN, 'tis generally held that all Saints are imperfect in this Life; and yet, if a Person who has profest to have the In-dwelling of the Holy Spirit, happens to have his Judgment altered afterwards in any Point in Religion, I have heard that Promise, <HI>The Spirit of Truth will guide you into all Truth</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xvi. 13.</NOTE>, improved as an Evidence that either they had not the Spirit then, or else were in an Error now; which is as much as to say, that when a Person is under the Operation of the Divine Spirit, his Judgment is then perfect; yea, and that he must never have any more Reformation in Principles. All that the Spirit teaches, is Truth; but he does not teach us all Truth at once; for the Just walk in that Path that <HI>shines more and more unto the perfect Day</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> iv. 18.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HOW often have we seen Persons that would cry out at others assuming GOD'S Prerogative in searching the Heart, when perhaps they had
<PB N="24" REF="009330_0023_1030EDDBCCDE7EA0"/>
no better Ground for their Charge, than only the Person's dealing plainly with others for Evil that they discovered; and yet they very soo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> would not stick to declare that those which they complained of were deluded by the Devil!</P>
<P>PRIDE is generally condemned in Word, and if any who were not introduced into the Mini∣stry in the common Way of the Land, attempt to preach the Gospel, many are ready to say to them as <HI>Elieb</HI> did to <HI>David, I know thy Pride, and the Naughtiness of thine Heart</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xvii. 28.</NOTE>; but they don't seem to suspect that Pride moves them to claim the Prerogative of introducing whom they think proper, and of forbiding all that follow not them, though it was that Principle which made <HI>Christ</HI>'s Disciples attempt such a Practice formerly<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mar.</HI> ix. 33▪ <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE>. Nay, according to the Behaviour of many in these Things, it looks as though they thought that Youths being pampered up at <HI>Col∣lege,</HI> and then being set over large Congregati∣ons, and to live in a great Deal of worldly Gran∣deur, secured them from being <HI>lifted up with Pride;</HI> and then falling <HI>into the Condemnation of the Devil,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 6.</NOTE> more than other Men. The ancient Exhortation to every Man, was <HI>Not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think; but to think soberly, according as</HI> GOD <HI>hath dealt to every Man the Measure of Faith</HI><NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><HI>Rom.</HI> xii. 3.</NOTE>. But now let a Man have never so much Knowledge of the Doctrines of Faith, or Experience of the Grace of Faith, and preach never so clearly; yea,
<PB N="25" REF="009330_0024_1030EDDD5D6E87D8"/>
and with never so much Success too; yet if he is not introduced in the Way mentioned above, how many are there that think they have suffi∣cient Warrant to reject him?</P>
<P>WHILE I am writing of these Things, I can (as it were) hear some say, "Take Care, you will bring the Ministry into Contempt?" I answer no, I would fain secure them from it, by labouring for a Reformation; for I believe each one will find that Saying true, sooner or later, <HI>Whosoever ex<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lteth himself shall be abased; and he that humbleth himself shall be exalted</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Luke</HI> xiv. 11.</NOTE>. And GOD'S Dealings towards his People in <HI>New-England</HI> for twenty Years back, have been won∣derfully calculated, like his Dispensations to∣wards <HI>Israel</HI> in the Wilderness, <HI>To humble them, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o prove them, to know what was in their Heart, whether they would keep his Commandments or no</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Deut.</HI> viii <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THEREFORE to proceed,</P>
<P>HOW many have there been among us, who have profest to have such Love to <HI>Christ</HI> and his Cause, that they would die for him, rather than deny him; who yet have acted quite other∣wise when Trials came on? But there is no End to enumerate Particulars, no Sect, nor Order of Men, are free of this dreadful Evil, of say∣ing one Thing and doing another; though some are much more guilty of it than others: And the Consideration hereof, is enough to <HI>abase</HI> all Flesh before GOD.

this Head, let me observe, that there is one Sort of People who strangely think themselves free of this Charge, of saying one Thing and prac∣tising another, because they don't profess Reli∣gion at all. They will exclaim at a high Rate against the Hypocrisy of Professors, and declare that they would not be guilty of mocking GOD as they do, upon no Account. Now here seems to be an Acknowledgment of the Divine Om∣niscience, and a Regard to Uprightness before him; and yet, at the same Time, they don't so much as pretend to regard his Authority, nor submit to his Government. Thus a pro∣fessed Regard to GOD, makes them disregard him; and while they explode Deceit and Self-Righteousness, sadly discover Marks of both: For while the <HI>Pharisee</HI> tells of his Fastings and Performances, these boast of their honest Hearts, and I believe many of them depend as much upon their <HI>Honesty,</HI> as others do upon their <HI>Duties.</HI> But are they really honest? They say they abhor Self-Righteousness, and it seems that they would not pretend to pray to GOD, because their Prayers would not be acceptable; that is, they will not come to him, because they find no Good in themselves to bring. What amazing Things are here! Here are Men that would not mock GOD, and yet live in open Contempt of his Service; they say they have honest Hearts, but will not so much as confess their Iniquities to him, whom they have provoked, nor seek his Mercy. O Heaven-daring Madness!</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="009330_0026_1030EDE241656FE8"/>THUS it appears, that Men are so far from avoiding Inconsistences, by disregarding Re∣ligion, that they involve themselves the deeper in Confusion and Guilt, and run in the high Road to eternal Ruin; while Professors are far from being excusable, in not practising agree∣able to their Profession. But one Way of Peace and Happiness therefore remains, which is to fly to the Blood of <HI>Christ,</HI> to <HI>purge our Consciences from dead Works,</HI> that we may <HI>serve the living God</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Heb.</HI> ix. 14.</NOTE>; and so to abide in him as the Branch does in the Vine, that we may bring forth much Fruit<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>John</HI> xv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BEFORE I conclude, I would set down a few Words of Advice, to my own Soul as well as others, which if rightly regarded, will afford much Help against the Evils mainly spoken of in this Discourse.</P>
<P N="1">1st. LET us meditate much upon the Per∣fections of GOD, especially his Omniscience and Omnipresence; that he fills all Places, and sees all Things. A realizing View hereof, will won∣derfully guard the Soul against all Deceit, as well as other Vices. When <HI>David</HI> had been devoutly contemplating upon these Things, it led him to renounce the Ways of wicked Men, and to cry to GOD to <HI>search</HI> his Heart and Thoughts, and see if there was any Way of Wickedness in him, <HI>and lead him in the Way everlasting</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psa.</HI> cxxxix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="28" REF="009330_0027_1030EDE9448D15B8"/>2d. LET us often review our Ways, and compare our Profession and Practice together; and endeavour to set ourselves as Spectators, critically to observe how our Conduct may ap∣pear to others. But because Self is so apt to blind us; therefore,</P>
<P N="3">3d. LET us prize and improve the faithful Reproofs of our Fellow-Christians. When the Man after GOD'S own Heart, had been crying to the Lord, that his Lips and Heart might be kept from wicked Works, as believing Prayer engages the Soul to wait for an Answer, in the Way of using the best Means to obtain the Thing requested; so he names this as a great Help in the Case, <HI>viz. Let the Righteous smite me, it shall be a Kindness; and let him reprove me, it shall be an excellent Oil which shall not break my Head</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Psal.</HI> cxli. 3, -5.</NOTE>. <HI>Solomon</HI> tells us, that <HI>open Rebuke is bet∣ter than secret Love;</HI> while he that hates Reproof is <HI>brutish,</HI> and <HI>shall die</HI><NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot"><HI>Prov.</HI> xxvii. 5; and xii. 1; and xv. 10.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>UPON the Whole, since the <HI>Jews</HI> trusted upon their outward Privileges, and rested in their out∣ward Forms, and thought, because of them, that their Case was safe, though their Hearts and Lives were contrary thereto; but were so far mistaken, that for these Things, and their rejecting the Saviour, they brought upon them∣selves and Posterity, such Woes as never befel any other People: May our Souls take effectual

Warning, not to rest in any Thing short of a Union with, and Conformity to <HI>Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>AND by all Means let us take Heed, that we do not treat this heavenly Friend as the <HI>Jews</HI> did heretofore. His coming is always contrary to Nature: The Prophet puts the Question in old Time thus, <HI>Who may abide the Day of his coming? and who shall stand when he appeareth? for he is like a Refiner's Fire, and like Fullers Soap</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mal.</HI> iii. 2.</NOTE>. But shall we regard our Dross and Filth, more than his Presence and Blessings? No, but may all set open Doors that the KING OF GLORY may come in. <HI>AMEN.</HI></P>
