<L>THO' SLANDER follows wheresoe'er I go,</L>
<L>To villisy the Art she does not know,</L>
<L>Undaunted (Guilt alone has cause to fear)</L>
<L>Cloath'd with this honour'd badge, I now appear,</L>
<L>Owning myself a MASON;—at the name,</L>
<L>No guilty redness dyes my cheek with shame:</L>
<L>Let Slander follow;—I her darts defy,</L>
<L>And laugh at sncering Folly's oft-told lye.</L>
<L>But what our Order teaches I will show;</L>
<L>The lessons you <HI>must</HI> love—when once you know.</L>
<L>It always bids us, humbly to ad ore</L>
<L>Th' <HI>Almighty Architect;</HI>—by whose great pow'r</L>
<L>The universe was built;—to his decree,</L>
<L>Which Wisdom ever guides, resign'd to be.</L>
<L>It makes us zealous in our country's cause,</L>
<L>True to its prince, and faithful to its laws;</L>
<L>Forever bids us with the strictest care,</L>
<L>To act with all the world upon the Square;</L>
<L>Never to publish a frail neighbour's shame;</L>
<L>Or filch away a brother's honest name;</L>
<L>To be sincere;—his secrets ne'er reveal,</L>
<L>And him to serve with fervency and zeal.</L>
<L>With true <HI>Philanthropy</HI> it warms our breast,</L>
<L>With useful zeal to succour the distrest;</L>
<L>Bids us show Mercy when we have the pow'r,</L>
<L>And to the houseless stranger ope the door;</L>
<L>The naked with warm vestments to infold,</L>
<L>And guard the shiv'ring wand'rers from the cold:</L>
<L>To feed the hungry—bid them <HI>eat</HI> and live,</L>
<L>And to the thirsty lip the cup to give;</L>
<L>To visit wretches torior'd by disease,</L>
<L>Make smooth their bed, and pour the balm of case.</L>
<L>The widow's tale, the orphan's cry to hear,</L>
<L>And from their eyes wive off Affliction's tear;</L>
<L>"To know each office, each endearing tye,</L>
<L>"Of soft-ey'd, heav'n-descended <HI>Charity."</HI></L>
<L>Upright it bids us walk;—to put a rein</L>
<L>On sensual appetites,—and Pride restrain.</L>
<L>It roots out narrow notions from the mind,</L>

<L>Be not offended, lovely, BEAUTEOUS FAIR,</L>
<L>That you from MASON'S RITES excluded are;</L>
<L>'Tis not because we think you would reveal,</L>
<L>What we as MASONS wish you to conceal,</L>

<L>Were you admited, LOVE would enter too;</L>
<L>That Jealousy might then our hearts inflame,</L>

<L>Whom the Church, and the Bar, and the Settate exclude?"</L>
<L>Struck dumb at this insult, with mortification,</L>
<L>Strait hither I shew to give vent to my passion;</L>
<L>But <HI>here</HI> each mild Brother wears such a <HI>kind</HI> face,</L>
<L>That I feel more inclin'd in the Epilogue's place,</L>
<L>Thus cooly and fairly to argue the case.</L>
<L>To those you aver <HI>we</HI> have no right of common—</L>
<L>Like the Crown of the French, fruit forbidden to Woman:</L>
<L>For the <HI>Church</HI> you object, with (be sure) deep discerning,</L>
<L>That <HI>we</HI> fail of your meekness, your grace, and your learning;</L>
<L>At the <HI>Bar</HI>—it perhaps may be urg'd that our clack</L>
<L>Would confound right with wrong, or turn white into black.</L>
<L>You might question <HI>our conscience</HI> to either fee pliant,</L>
<L>Or doubt <HI>our</HI> concern for the wrongs of a client.—</L>
<L>In the <HI>Senate</HI>—when women sit <HI>there</HI> (you will say)</L>
<L>Poor ruin'd Old England may rue the sad day:</L>
<L>For<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> title, the <HI>Sex</HI> MAGNA CHARTA may barter,</L>
<L>Or the great BILL OF RIGHTS, for a ribbon or garter;</L>
<L>But whilst <HI>Man,</HI> mighty <HI>Man,</HI> at the Bar shall preside,</L>
<L>Guard the fold of the <HI>Church,</HI> or the state-rudder guide,</L>
<L>In security (doubtless) Religion shall smile,</L>
<L>And <HI>Law</HI> and sweet <HI>Liberty</HI> brighten our isle;</L>
<L>Yet, O ye select ones, who boast of your feeling,</L>
<L>Your charity, candour, and fair open dealing;</L>
<L>Ye MASONS! come now for your reasons, and tell us</L>
<L>Why you from your order for ever expel us!</L>
<L>Is it some treas'nous plot that you wickedly dive in?</L>
<L>No—a plot would have call'd for fine <HI>Female</HI> contriving.</L>
<L>Or is it for fear we should <HI>blab</HI> all we know?</L>
<L>No—you'll own we <HI>con</HI> keep <HI>some</HI> few secrets from you.</L>
<L><PB N="163" REF="023128_0167_0FBC6B3A9E99ADE0"/>
Or is it—but hold—I've a tale in my head,</L>
<L>('Tis a story mayhap you have formerly read)</L>
<L>How Sampson was wheedled and teiz'd by his <HI>wise,</HI></L>
<L>'Till he gave up his <HI>secret,</HI> his <HI>strength,</HI> and his life.</L>
<L>Alas! if like Dalilah, thus we should court ye,</L>
<L>'Till our PIANO at last charm you out of your FORTE;</L>
<L>Who knows, (and I fairly acknowledge my fears)</L>
<L>But like her we may bring an old house o'er our ears?</L>
<L>Then be warn'd, O ye Fair! curiosity cease,</L>
<L>Let us leave them their myst'ries and secrets in peace;</L>
<L>And with candour confess the Men most to our mind.</L>
<L>Whom Secrecy, Truth, and Fidelity bind.—</L>
<L>The fruits of their UNION our blessing shall prove,</L>
<L>For the heart that buds Friendship <HI>must</HI> blossom with Love.</L>

<HEAD>EPILOGUE II.</HEAD>
<L>IN days of yore, 'tis said the merry Greek,</L>
<L>Old Aesop,—held, that birds and beasts could speak;</L>
<L>Owls moraliz'd,—Jack daws could reason finely,</L>
<L>Horses neigh'd sense,—Apcs chatter'd most divinely.</L>
<L>Lucky it is for you this gift is lost,</L>
<L>A Rat might else have lurk'd beneath a post;</L>
<L>Tho' you expel us Women from your house,</L>
<L>You could not banish each insidious Mouse:</L>
<L>A Fly might then have whisper<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d to the gale;</L>
<L>A tiny Cricket might have told the tale;</L>
<L>Happy the Women! happy were the Men!</L>
<L>You could have kept no secrets from us then.</L>
<L>Yet can <HI>our</HI> days some prodigies afford,</L>
<L>The Cock-lane ghost scratch'd on the vocal board;</L>
<L>Fanny <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>visited the upper air,</L>
<L>And ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>t all London by the list'ning ear.</L>
<L>The Stockwell conj'rer his enchantments brew'd,</L>
<L>Saucers and cups, with motive powers endu'd;</L>
<L>The active glasses nimbly danc'd the hays;</L>
<L>Th' unwieldy dresser, and the wooden trays</L>
<L>Jump'd rigadoons!—the pudding piping hot</L>
<L>Came tumbling, rolling, bouncing from the pot.</L>
<L>Now, my good sirs, if all these facts <HI>have</HI> been;</L>
<L>Why may not greater miracles be seen?</L>
<L>Things that can <HI>move</HI> against the course of Nature,</L>
<L>May likewise <HI>speak.</HI>—you grant it,—<HI>ergo datur.</HI></L>
<L>O! should I learn the secret from <HI>your</HI> bowl,</L>
<L>Would it not vex you to the very soul?</L>
<L>What say st thou, honest bowl—when met together,</L>
<L>What's the chief subject of discourse?—the weather!—</L>
<L><PB N="164" REF="023128_0168_0FBC6B3D78363A70"/>
True Englishmen's discourse—'tis cold to-night—</L>
<L>'Tis very cold indeed; you're right, sir, right.</L>
<L>Or is it scandal, honest bowl?—Ah me!</L>
<L>I ask your pardon, that's the vice of tea.</L>
<L>Or is it polities? the Boston boys</L>
<L>Tarring and feathering, rioting and noise!</L>
<L>But, serious now,—all raillery apart;</L>
<L>I honour and esteem you from my heart;</L>
<L>Knowing yourselves, you scorn the dead-born jest;</L>
<L>Yours is the feeling mind, the virtuous breast.</L>
<L>Should the laugh echo from the weak and vain,</L>
<L>The laugh of <HI>Folly</HI> cannot fix a stain.</L>
<L>Your souls attend to Pity's voice sincere;</L>
<L>Friendship and mild Affection harbour there.</L>
<L>Your wives, your children, will approve the lay;</L>
<L>And conscious own the truth of what I say.</L>
<L>On you the Fair with safety may rely;</L>
<L>Masons exist but by Fidelity.</L>
<L>Accept this Eulogy upon your Art,</L>
<L>The humble tribute of a grateful heart.</L>
