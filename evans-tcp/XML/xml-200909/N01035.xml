<HEAD>AN EPISTLE TO THE READER.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Christian Reader;</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Direct this my Book to thee, without any regard to one Sect more than ano∣ther, for the Unity and Fellowship of Gods People is Love, and this Love is the Bond of Perfectness, and by this Love shall all men know that we are Christs Disciples; and if this Love be with us and dwell in us, by it we shall know that we are translated from Death unto Life; for that Faith which purifies the Soul works by this Love, and by this Faith which works by Love, we come to have the Victory over the World.</P>
<P><HI>Beloved Brethred,</HI> Since that great Apo∣stacy <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ath been, which the holy Apost <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB REF="001232_0002_0FB135C39D420550"/>did in their day fore-tell of, which hath spread over Nations and Kingdoms, so that the very Names of things in Scripture hath been, and in many things yet are wrongly applyed, and generally believed to be that which they are not; &amp; those false Customs which this great Apostacy hath brought in, hath been received, and yet is in many things for Truths; but God hath in these latter Age<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> raised up such Lights in the World at several times, as hath discovered much of the great Mystery of Iniquity; but they have alwayes been accounted (at their first appearing) as Deceivers and Se∣ducers and the like, by the dark World in general, and met with great opposition from the Powers of this World, even from the Powers of Darkness; but the God with whom all Power is, hath so born them up, through their Faith, so that the Gates of Hell were not able to with-stand them, nor all the Powers of Darkness able to gain-say them, so that Satan hath been forced to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>it up a new Form of pretended Holiness to deceive the World with, at several times, yea, even at every such appearance of the Light of the Gospel; for so often as the Lord hath been pleased to reveal unto his Church the Life and Light of the Gospel, by shining into the hearts of his Children, so often hath there
<PB REF="001232_0003_0FB135C7D342AA00"/>been a falling away, and that old Serpent, called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole World, hath at such times en∣deavoured to work in the hearts of Gover∣nours and great Men of the Earth, to set up that which they imagin to be the Wor∣ship of God, and to maintain the same; &amp; this hath ever been a Snare and Net where∣by Gods Children have been ensnared, and Hypocrites set up; for the true worship of God is in Righteousness and true Holiness in the inner man, and none can thus wor∣ship God till he sets them free from the <HI>Egypt</HI> of sin, and works this Righteousness in their hearts by his own Spirit; and such as these cannot conform to any prescribed from set up by the Powers of Darkness of this World, without procuring the great displeasure of God; for they are to be Gods Witnesses of that Worship, which God hath set up in the hearts of his own Children, who alone can worship God in Spirit and in Truth, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Light of the World, and yet are but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gers and Pilgrims in the World; for their Kingdom is not of this World. But those that fall away from the Spirit of Truth into the Spirit of the World, are the false Pro∣phets and Anti-christs, and these are they whom the world doth follow &amp; close in with,
<PB REF="001232_0004_0FB135C99F88BD18"/>according to Scripture Testimony; for saith the Scripture, They are of the World, and the World heareth them; he that is not of God heareth not us; by this we know the Spirit of Truth and the Spirit of Error. Here is a plain Description laid down for us to know the false Prophets by, to wit, For the World heareth them; by this we know they are always the greatest Number, be∣cause the Body of the People will hear and speak well of them; but the World will not hear nor speak well of the true, saith the Scripture; and this is the Description the Scripture gives us to know them by, 1 <HI>John</HI> 4.5, 6. <HI>Luke</HI> 6.26. <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.11, 12.</P>
<P>What I have written in this Book to the Churches of Christ, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> I did present to the Ministry of the said People in the time of a General Meeting at <HI>Rhode-Island,</HI> desiring of them it might be read to the Congregation at the said Meeting, and so handed among them till it came to <HI>Will. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> and the rest of their Ministry. But after the Ministry had perused it, some of them told me, <HI>That I knew they did look at Water-Baptism useless after a Person came to be b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tized with the Spirit.</HI> To which I reply'd, Your argument is just contrary to the Scrip∣ture, for said <HI>Peter, Can any Man forb<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Wa∣ter,
<PB REF="001232_0005_0FB135CB1FBF4608"/>that these should not be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, which have received the holy Ghost, as well as we? And <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e commanded them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> in the Name of the Lord,</HI> Acts 10.47, 48. Another re∣plyed, saying, <HI>Thou holds forth the Light con∣trary to what we have done, both in our publick Testimonies and printed Books.</HI> To which I answered, if you can shew me wherein I have held it forth contrary to the holy Scrip∣tures, it shall be rectified: But I heard no further reply to that. I then told them, That if they would be pleased to publish it among themselves, I should be satisfied, and proceed no further in it, otherwise my purpose was to print it. Whereupon some of them asked me, whether I would be sa∣tisfied if they read it in their private Mee∣ting? I told them, yes; for I directed it to them, and not to the World. Upon which they appointed me to come to the same place the next Morning as seven of the clock for an answer: accordingly I did, where my Book was returned to me again, some say∣ing, it holds forth things contrary to what we have done, both in our publick Testimo∣nies and printed Books, and may make a Division amongst us To which I answer'd, I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Truth make a Division among you, it is such a Division as Christ came to make. But they thus refusing to publish it among
<PB REF="001232_0006_0FB135CCB4FF69D0"/>themselves, I have thought it my Duty to put it to publick view, believing there is yet a Remnant among them which have not defiled their Garments.</P>
<P>I have also added something more at the end of that Epistle which I presented to them, to show the difference between the <HI>Ministration of the Moral Law,</HI> (written in the hearts of all the Children of <HI>Adam</HI>) and of the <HI>Ministration of the Gospel of Jesus Christ</HI> (written on the heart of Gods Children by the Spirit of the living God) the one being the <HI>Light of Condemnation,</HI> the other being the <HI>Light of Life,</HI> or the <HI>Light of our Justi∣fication,</HI> through Faith in the Blood of Jesus Christ, and both proceeding from one and the self-same God.</P>
<P>And as to what I have written to the <HI>Observers of the Seventh-Day Sabbath,</HI> These may certifie thee, that after it pleased God, through his rich Grace in Christ Jesus, to take away the Guilt of my Sins from my Conscience, and to send the Spirit of his Son into my heart, whereby he did reveal unto me his love, and his acceptance of me in Jesus Christ; this unspeakable Mercy did greatly engage my heart to love God, &amp; dili∣gently to search the Scriptures, that there by I might know how to serve God acceptably,
<PB REF="001232_0007_0FB135CE8ED24020"/>for then I soon became a seeker how to worship God, tho' more zealous of the Tra∣ditions of my Fathers, till I saw them to be Traditions, and no Scripture-Pr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>epts. I thus upon diligent search of the Scrip∣tures found that the First-Day Sabbath was no where commanded by any Law of God, and the Scripture telling me, Where no Law is there can be no Transgression, and that it is but vain to worship God by mens Traditions, <HI>Mat.</HI> 15.9. and also finding by Scripture, that there was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Commandment for the keeping of the seventh Day, I the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> openly labour'd on the first Day of the Week, in faithfulness to God and my fellow Crea∣ture, and strictly kept the 4th Command∣ment, which commanded labour on the first Day of the Week, and required rest on the 7th. But I continuing a diligent searcher of the holy Scriptures, and begging at the Throne of Grace for direction in the way of Truth, it pleased God to open my Under∣standing, to understand the Scriptures, and to see that the 7th Day Sabbath was but a Sign (under the Law) of a Gospel Rest that Christ gives the Soul, and that the shadow∣ing part of the Law was nailed to the Cross of Christ: I could then no longer observe the 7th Day Sabbath without defiling my Conscience; for faith Christ, <HI>Mat.</HI> 10.27.
<PB REF="001232_0008_0FB135CF991A9ED8"/>What I tell you in Darkness, that speak ye in the light, and what ye hear in the Ear, that preach ye upon the House tops. I then wrot to those my Brethren that kept the 7th Day Sabbath, showing them how it was but a Sign or shadow of a better thing that was to come by Jesus Christ, and since have writ this following Epistle to them, wherein is opened the Covenant of the Law, and the Covenant of Grace, the first Covenant be∣ing a figure of the second; which Covenant, with all the Rites and Ceremonies of it, con∣tinued until the establishment of the New Testament by the Blood of Jesus Christ; in which Testament contains the substance of all those things shadowed out in the first Co∣venant; and tho' the shadowing part of the Law was nailed to the Cross of Christ, and so ceased, as they were signs and shadows, yet it is as easie for Heaven and Earth to pass as it is for one Tittle (of what was shadowed out by the Law) to escape of be∣ing fulfilled by Christ in the substance of it; for what God had before determined should be fulfilled by Christ, was prophesied of by the Law, as well as by the Prophets, as is to be seen, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.13. But <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Baptist</HI> came so near to him, that he point∣ed thim, saying, <HI>Behold, the Lamb of God that taket<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> away the sin of the World,</HI> John 1.29.</P>
<P><PB REF="001232_0009_0FB135D11C4C4728"/>
I have thought it my Duty to put these things to publick view, being sensible of the Wiles of Satan, who is wont to work in the Darkness of Men, to mis-lead them, to make Idols of such things which God commanded to be observed as signs of In∣structions to his Church, as is to be seen, <HI>Numb.</HI> 21 9. compared with 2 <HI>Kings</HI> 18 4. and what it was a sign of, is to be seen, <HI>John</HI> 3.14, 15.</P>

<HEAD>An Epistle to the Churches of Christ, call'd <HI>Quakers.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>JOhn Rogers,</HI> a Servant of Jesus Christ, To <HI>William Penn</HI> and the rest of the Elders and Churches of Christ, called, <HI>Quakers,</HI> Grace and Peace be unto you, from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P><HI>Beloved in the Lord,</HI> When I consider the Blessed day of the Lords appearing unto you, when he first illuminated you, it greatly affects my heart, considering how ye endu∣red a great fight of Affliction, and not only took joyfully the spoiling of your Goods, but also your souls were seen to lie under the Altar, being slain for the Word of God, and for the Testimony you held in that day, and loved not your Lives unto the Death; for you had washed your Garments in the Blood of the Lamb, and made them white, and did live under this great blessing, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.11. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssed are ye when men shall Revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsly for my Names sak<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Then did there flow out of your Bellies Rivers of
<PB N="2" REF="001232_0011_0FB135D5A5ADFB18"/>living Waters, which did proceed from the Throne of God and of the Lamb; for you was then adorned as a Bride prepared to meet her Husband, and many of you did run to and fro, and know edge was encrea∣sed in that Day; for your Earthen Vessels were fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed with heavenly Treasure, by him that commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness, who then shined into your hearts by his divine Light, and filled your Vessels with the Oyl of gladness; and in that Day this was your Victory over the world, even your Faith, and it did work by a pure love, which was shed abroad in your hearts, by the holy Ghost sent down from Heaven; for then was your Bodies purely cleansed, and so became a Habitation for God to dwe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in by his holy Spirit, who was then the Object of your Hope, and the ground of your Faith, to believe things not seen, and so, through Hope, patiently to wait for them.</P>
<P><HI>Beloved in the Lord,</HI> Consider the Mar∣riage Covenant that was in that Day be∣tween him and you, who had espoused you to himself; you were then joyned to him by one Spirit, and served him then in that Spirit, in the newness thereof, even him whom God raised <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the dead. When <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> consider that love that was then in that
<PB N="3" REF="001232_0012_0FB135D741B74CF0"/>day between him and you, my-very heart melts within me! O how did Christ, your loving Husband imbrace you in the Arms of his Love! for he knew that you were no Harlot, but true to him. O how great was your love to him in that day! many waters could not quench it, neither could the floods drown it; it utterly contemned all the glo∣ry and pleasures of this World, and im∣bracea him alone; Tribulation could not seperate you, nor Distress, nor Persecution, nor Famine, nor Nakedness, nor Peril, not Sword; yea, in all things you were Con∣quorers in that day, through him that loved you and espoused you to himself.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Brethren,</HI> your Eyes see, and your Ears hear that it is your Brother that speaks to you by a spiritual and divine Un∣derstanding, which is given me by the Spirit of Truth, for the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned, yea, it is impossible that the Na∣tural man should know Christ after a spi∣ritual manner, for carnal men know Christ no other way but after the flesh, they know not any man as he is a New Creature, but so many of you as are Spiritual, can discern this Voice from whence it is.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001232_0013_0FB135D9006DF858"/>
And now, <HI>Brethren,</HI> I have further to de∣clare unto you concerning the two Trees in the mist of the Garden of God, the one cal∣led, <HI>The Tree of Life,</HI> the other, called, <HI>The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil.</HI> The Tree of Life, with its Branches, represents the state of Christ, with his Members: The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, with its Fruit and Branches, represents the state of the first <HI>Adam</HI> and his Posterity. It was the purpose of God before these two <HI>Adams</HI> were brought forth, that the Elder should serve the Younger, and that the first should be a figure of him that was to come, that so Gods choice might stand, not of Works, but of him that calleth, having before de∣termined, that the Elder should serve the Younger, which accordingly after appeared, for the first <HI>Adam,</HI> for the sake of one mor∣sel of the forbidden Fruit, sold his Birth∣right, and so lost the Blessing, and was dis∣inherited. For it was the purpose of God to take our Nature, and so to have the glory of all his Works himself; and therefore he made the first <HI>Adam</HI> in his own Image, and after his own likeness, in respect that he made him upright, and to be immortal, and gave him dominion over the fish of the Sea, and over the Fowl of the Air, and the Beasts of the Field, yea, and over all the Earth;
<PB N="5" REF="001232_0014_0FB135DA40B9F960"/>and thus he bore the Image of God, but was not God; but the second <HI>Adam</HI> is the Lord from Heaven a quickening Spirit, in his divine Nature, who made all things for the honour of himself.</P>
<P>When the first <HI>Adam</HI> had eaten of the for∣bidden F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>uit, his Eyes were opened, and not before, and a divine Light of the righteous Law of God did manifest to him both good and evil, and let him see his just condem∣nation for his Transgression; for the Sword of Gods Justice stopt the way to the Tree of Life, and sentenced him to dye, so that <HI>A∣dam</HI> might see and know nothing by it but Death; it left him without any ground of hope of Mercy, yea, it read to him this doleful Sentence, <HI>T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> shalt surely dye,</HI> and so left him. So that he could not come at the Tree of Life to eat of that, but by the free gift of God, who promised, <HI>That the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpents Head;</HI> for he that had the power of Death was the Devil, who was now become the god of this world, ruling in their hearts, so that now there was no recovery of man, but by a Resurrection from the dead; for there could be no Redemption from Gods Sen∣tence against <HI>Adams</HI> sin, in eating of the forbidden Fruit, but immediately his Eves were opened, and a divine Light shined in
<PB N="6" REF="001232_0015_0FB135DB9FE0D3E0"/>him, to give him the knowledge of good &amp; evil, that by it the second <HI>Adam</HI> might judge the World at the Resurrection of the Body. And tho' this Light in all men be the true Light of Condemnation, and lighteth every one that cometh into the World, and pro∣ceedeth from the Life of God, yet it gives us no life, but condemns us to death; for it was not the gift of God to <HI>Adam</HI> and his Posterity for Justification, but upon their own perfect Obedience to it; but it was for a Light to <HI>Adam</HI> and to his Posterity, that by it they might see their own Nakedness, upon their Disobedience, and fear Gods Wrath and Justice for the same; for the Righteousness of this Light is not to be found in the first <HI>Adam,</HI> not in his Posterity, there∣fore it is their Condemnation; but it is the free gift of Righteousness, through Faith in the second <HI>Adam,</HI> who hath received the Promise of the Spirit, and sent it into our hearts, and so we come to have our Naked∣ness covered with a Garment that God cloathes us withal, and not of our own making; for it is not works of Righteous∣ness that we can do, that is acceptable to God, but it is his own work, in creating us a new, through Faith in the second <HI>Adam,</HI> the Seed of the Woman, that God did then promise should bruise the Serpents head, &amp;
<PB N="7" REF="001232_0016_0FB135DD133FCF88"/>so come to obtain the Kingdom himself, who is the Tree of Life, and gives to them that believe on him, to eat of it, that they may live forever; for he hath power to raise the dead, and hath overcome him that hath the Power of Death, in that he was raised from the dead, as it is written, <HI>This is he that liveth, and was dead, and behold be liveth for evermore, and hath the Keys of Hell and Death,</HI> and will at the last day open the Graves that the dead may come forth, and doth now quicken whom he will, being the Tree of Life which is in the midst of the Garden. And thus we come to be living Branches of it, and come to receive the Righteousness of this Light, by the free gift of God, through Faith in Christ; for the natural man is sensual, not having the Spirit of Christ; and the Spirit of Christ is the Righteousness of the Law, or of this divino Light, so that no man can by anyendea∣vouring to perform the Righteousness which this Lighs requires, ever be able to perform it. So that the second <HI>Adam</HI> was not sent to be a Saviour to such as this Light doth justifie, but to be a Saviour to such as see all their endeavours to live up to it, to be in vain; for it is the true Light that makes all men see what dwells in them, and that the Law of Sin, that dwells in their
<PB N="9" REF="001232_0017_0FB135DE90E18880"/>Members, hath Dominion over them, and compels them to rebel against this Light of Righteousness, which shines in them; so that they are in a state of Death and Dark∣ness, as to Righteousness, and by it see all hope in themselves to fail, and to prize the rich Mercy of God, which comes by the Death &amp; Resurrection of Jesus Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself a Sacrifice for sin, so that through Faith in his Blood we receive the gift of the Righteous∣ness of this Light, by his Spirit sent into our heatrs, which Righteousness this light justifies, and no other; and when we have received this Righteousness into our hearts, through faith in the Blood of Christ, this Light discovers to our certain knowledge, that we are made partakers of Gods Righ∣teoushess, which Righteousness was with God before the World was made, but Man being in a state of sin, doth not comprehend that this Light proceeds from the Life of God, or divine Nature of Christ, and that Gods Wrath cannot be pacified but by a per∣fect Obedience to it; for the Righteousness of Christ, and this Light, is both of one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ture; for this Light proceeds from that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nal Life that was with God, and was God, and it lays the sinful World naked either to Gods Judgment or Mercy, so that his Mercy
<PB N="10" REF="001232_0018_0FB135E2AC202C50"/>and Justice may both be seen by this Light that shineth in Darkness, but the Darkness doth not comprehend it; and by it that Man whom God hath appointed will judge the World.</P>
<P>Now we receive the Spirit of Adoption by the hearing of Faith preached by the Gospel, and thereby believing in the God that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead; for it is he that hath received of the Father the promise of the holy Ghost, and only through Faith in his Name we receive it; for him hath God the Father sealed, and given him a Name above every Name, and hath made him Heir of all things that the first <HI>Adam</HI> did possess, as a figure for a time; and all that believe in this second <HI>Adam,</HI> do receive the Spirit of Adoption, which witnesseth with their Spirits that they are the Children of God, and if Children then Heirs of God, and jo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nt Heirs with Christ; for he hath given us his Spirit in earnest, until we come to inherit the purchased Pos∣session, which will be when all things come to be restored from the bondage of Corrup∣tion (for it is subjected under hope of Re∣covery, tho lost by the first <HI>Adam</HI>) then shall God reign as visible as the first <HI>Adam</HI> did, in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erson or Manhood of the second <HI>Adam,</HI> over all the Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s of his glorious
<PB N="11" REF="001232_0019_0FB135E3D7AA5D68"/>Creation, and all the Saints with him, whose Kingdom is an uncorruptible Kingdom, and therefore corruptible flesh and blood cannot inherit it.</P>
<P>Now since the fall of the first <HI>Adam,</HI> and promise of the second, God (under the Law) did appoint shadows and figures of the Birth and Sufferings, Death and Resurrection of the second <HI>Adam,</HI> which were as a School-Master or Instructor to his Church, that they might see a Resurrection from the dead by the second <HI>Adam,</HI> so that his People might hope to come to enjoy the Garden of Happiness by the second <HI>Adam,</HI> tho' lost by the first And tho' we have eat of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, in the first <HI>Adam,</HI> and so come to receive the Light of Condemnation to Death thereby; so also, we that believe have eaten of the Tree of Life, through Faith in the second <HI>Adam,</HI> and thereby is Life and Immortality brought to light by his Resurrection from the dea.</P>
<P>And as the Law and Prophets did prophecy of the coming of the second <HI>Adam,</HI> to wit, of his Birth, of his Death, and of his Re∣surrection that is to say, of God becoming Man, and so laying down his Life, and ta∣king it up again, and thereby to give assur∣ance to his Children of a Resurrection; so we have the Testimony of his Apostles in Scripture, that the second <HI>Adam</HI> is come, &amp;
<PB N="12" REF="001232_0020_0FB135E55471A868"/>that he did dye, and that God hath raised him from the Dead, and that he is the Son of God, and Heir of his Fathers Inheritance, which Inheritance the first <HI>Adam</HI> lost by Dis∣obedience; and that God did confirm their Testimony of his Resurrection, by many Signs and Wonders, and Miracles and Gifts of the holy Ghost, which Signs &amp; Wonders God wrought by their hands, <HI>Heb</HI> 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>4. <HI>Joh.</HI> 20.27.28, 29. compared with 31 <HI>vers.</HI> and <HI>Acts</HI> 3 15. compared with <HI>Acts</HI> 5.30 32. And also the Scripture testifieth, That the holy Ghost is a Witness of his Resurrection to all them that obey him, yea, God hath raised us up, together with him, to newness of Life, that is to say, so many as have re∣ceived him by Faith, he having taken away from us the guilt of sin, and free'd us from the fear of Wrath to come, so that we can boldly say, <HI>O Death, where is thy string! O Grave, where is thy Victory!</HI> So that every one that believes hath the witness of God in himself, to confirm the Truth of the holy Scriptures, and thereby can set to their Seals that the Scripture is true.</P>
<P>Also, we have the Testimony of Scrip∣ture, That Jesus baptized with Water by the hands of his Apostles, in that he com∣manded them to do it, it is said he did it, <HI>John</HI> 3.22, and <HI>v<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.</HI> 20. compared with the

And his A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stles did practise it after his Resurrecti∣on and Ascention, as a visible sign of his Death and Resurrection, in burying the baptized into the likeness of his Death, and raising them up in the likeness of his Resur∣rection; for as the God-head of Christ did raise his Man-hood from the Dead, so doth his God-head witness it in every one that believes and obeys him, by condemning and mortifying sin in them, which is an imme∣diate Witness of God, that the oftering of the Body or Man-hood of Christ is an ac∣ceptable Sacrifice for sin, and that the guile is really taken from the Conscience, where R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mission is, and the Def<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ement of it really purged away: This is all done through Gods acceptance of his Death for sin. And as to the power of his Resurrection, God gives an immediate Witness to that also; for as the God-head of Christ hath raised him from the Dead, so also doth his God-head quicken us, and raises us up together with him, who were before dead in sin, and will also raise up our Bodies at the last Day.</P>
<P>And as God hath taken our Nature, even the seed of the Woman, and so consequently the Seed of the first <HI>Adam</HI> (for the Woman was taken out of the Man) I say, as God hath taken of our flesh and blood, so also
<PB N="14" REF="001232_0022_0FB135EB5ED05228"/>hath he made us partakers of his divine Na∣ture or holy Spirit, which is the gift of Righ∣teousness by Jesus Christ.

<P>And as to the <HI>Supper of the Lord,</HI> it ought to be attended by his Church, as it is delivered to his Church by the Scripture, <HI>How that the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Bread</HI> (when they were at Supper with him) <HI>and brake it, and said, Take, eat, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> my Body which is broken for you, This do in<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mbrance of m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</HI> This bread is to sign sie that it is he that gives us to eat of the Tree <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> which is in the midst of the Gar∣den, that we may eat and live forever, in

<P>As also, the Wine after Supper, which he gave them to drink, is to be attended by his Church, as a visible sign that this second <HI>Adam,</HI> as he was flesh and blood as we are (sin only excepted) did through his God∣head or eternal Spirit, offer up himself as a Lamb without spot for us. And thus by the shedding of his Blood we have obtained the Remission of sins, witnessed to us by his divine Nature, in taking away the guilt of sin from our Conscience, and sanctifying us by his Spirit, through Faith in his Blood, so that we know this is he that came by Water and Blood, even Jesus Christ, not only by that divine Water that sanctifies us, but by Blood also, <HI>for without shedding of Blood there could be no Remission of sins.</HI></P>

<P>WHen <HI>Adam</HI> stood nakedly innocent before God, he was not ashamed, but when he had disobeyed, by eating of the forbidden Fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, there was an Eye opened in him to see himself nakedly guilty, and therefore hid himself from the presence of God.

<P>And whereas God did promise, <HI>That the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpents Head,</HI> This Victory comes by a Resurrection from the Dead, for that Jesus Christ is now alive, that was once dead, and liveth for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er-more, and hath the Keys of Hell and of Death, and will open the Graves that the Dead may come forth to Judgment, and doth now quicken whom he will, who were before dead in sin; for he is that Tree of Life, and hath overcome him that hath the Power of Death, and hath brought to light Life and Immortality; for in him we come to eat of the Tree of Life, being before dead in our sins; and thus we come to have the

<PB N="23" REF="001232_0031_0FB17C7D83DF5D10"/>Repentance hath still Remission, through the Blood of Jesus Christ; and thus the Righteousness of the Law is fulfilled in us, by the gift of Gods Spirit; for no man is justified in his sin, but in his Justification is freed from his sin, being <HI>purified</HI> by the Spirit or Truth which is given to him, not because he hath been obedient to the Light, but to enable him to be obedient to the Light with∣in; neither is any man just<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fied by the Righ∣teousness which Christ hath fulfilled in his own Person, till Christ works the same Righteousness in us, by his own Spirit; so that we are not justified in Gods sight till the Righteousness of the Law be fulfilled in us, by Christs Spirit working it in us, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit, which is given to us to lead &amp; guide us into all Truth. But those that are under only the first Ministration of the Knowledge of good and evil, are under the Condemnation of it, if ever they have rebelled against it, and it is their Condemnation because of their sin, and will never justifie them from their sin, which they have once committed, and therefore can never come to Salvation by following it, after one Transgression committed, but always see before their Eyes Gods Cherubims standing with a flam∣ing Sword to keep the way of the Tree of
<PB N="24" REF="001232_0032_0FB17C7EECD73B98"/>Life, that by this Light within them they may see nothing but Death for their Sin, and are never afterable to come to Salvation by their endeavouring to live up to this Light, tho' they could do it, by a perfect Obedience, ever after one sin committed; and therefore Christ came to save only such as are sinners against it, by ministring to them that Life that the Tree of Life was a figure of; and when they come under this second or Gospel Ministration, they eat of the Tree of Life, and then come to see Life in themselves, even the Life of God that quickens them, who were before dead in their Sins and Trespasses, but now are come to see Life and Righteousness in themselves, not by their endeavouring to follow the Light within, for to obtain Salvation by their so doing, but they are now come to see that the Gift of Life and Righteousness is given to them through Faith in the Blood of Jesus Christ, tho' they had not done that good, the knowledge of which God had placed in them, nor avoided the doing of that evil, of which God had placed the knowledge in them, but had thus sinned against the Light within, which was sent into the World to condemn the World for sin, for it was the first Ministra∣tion, but God sent not his Son into the
<PB N="25" REF="001232_0033_0FB17C806929C010"/>World to condemn the world for sin, but that the sinful world by him might be saved. And this Son of God is the Word of Life, in his divine Nature, and quickens the dead sinner; which Word of Life is the second or Gospel Ministration; so that ex∣cept a man be born again he cannot see the Kingdom of God or second Ministration, nor understand any thing of it by this Light within or Knowledge of good and evil, till it be revealed by Faith in the Blood of Jesus Christ; and this Word of Life is very God revealed in us, not as a Judge, but as a Sa∣viour; and this Li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is the Light of the World, and doth as far excell the first Mi∣nistration, as the light of the Sun doth ex∣cell the light of the Moon and Stars; for the one is the light of Condemnation, but the other is the light of Justification; in the first there is an eye opened in us to see our just Condemnation for our sin; in the second, there is an eye opened to see our Justification from our sins.</P>

<P><HI>Beloved Brethren in Jesus Christ,</HI> Grace and Peace be unto you from God the Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ the Son of the Father.</P>
<P>Since it hath pleased God of his much mercy and rich grace in Christ Jesus, who commanded the light to shine out of dark∣ness, who hath also shined into my heart, and thereby hath given me the sight and knowledg of those things which the natural man cannot understand, I have been under
<PB N="38" REF="001232_0046_0FB17C9876EEF530"/>a great conff<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ct concerning my Brethren, that they also might come to be made par∣takers of the same Light and Grace, without which we cannot discern those Mysteries contained in the holy Scriptures. I am greatly sensible that many, since their fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st illumination, might have been Teachers of others, had they not been unfruitful Branches in Christ, and they thus continuing in this carnal state, their understanding is much darkned, and they cannot see afar off, nor understand the Mystries of the Kingdom of God, by reason of which I am sensible that I cannot speak to such, as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal, even as unto Babes in Christ.</P>
<P>I can truly say with the Apostle, That I have many things to say concerning the Priesthood of our Lord Jesus Christ, but it is hard to be uttered, because ye are dull of hearing divine and spiritual things; when indeed the heart and mind of <HI>Christians</HI> are fixt on spiritual things, it is both life and peace to them, but when their hearts and minds are set upon the observation of some outward Rudiments or shadowing figures of the law, it brings death upon the soul, be∣cause the mind is set upon the shadows of heavenly things &amp; not upon Christ himself, who is the substance and head of all Princi∣pality
<PB N="39" REF="001232_0047_0FB17C9A093C49D0"/>and Power whatsoever.</P>
<P>I am greatly sensible that the Man-hood of Christ is preached up and generaly con∣fest and belived on, with a dead faith, from the report of the holy Scriptures; and in a carnal way rejoyced in, believing he is the Saviour of the World; but as to his divine nature, many Professors are strangers to it, and know nothing of the power and vertue of it; for it is his divine nature that imputes the Righteousness of God to us; it is his divine nature that quickens us, and streng∣theneth us against the power of sin; it is his divine nature that reveals to us our Jus∣tification, and that sanctifies us, and is our life, and light, and wisdom, yea, the divine nature of Christ applies to us all the virtues of the Sufferings of his Man-hood, and there∣by reveals to us, the truth of the history of the Scriptures about his Sufferings, so that we can set to our seal that the Scripture is true.</P>
<P>I have written unto you, <HI>beloved Brethren,</HI> concerning the two Covenants, and do desire you in a Christian love to search the Scrip∣tures, and to see whether these things be so or no.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>What are we to understand by the first; Covenant; or o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Testament?</HI></P>

And he declared unto you his Cove∣nant, which he commanded you to perform, even Ten Commandments, and he wrote them upon two Tables of Stone.

<PB N="41" REF="001232_0049_0FB17C9F2EF2E3F0"/>hundrerd and thirty years after. From hence we may note, that the Apostle speaks of this Law of the ten Commandments given after they came out of <HI>Egyst,</HI> which was four hundred and thirty years after that Covenant which God made with <HI>Abraham</HI> in Christ, and was after they came out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as appears <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>12th</HI> of <HI>Exodus</HI> 41. And it came to pass, at the end of four hundred and thirty years, even the self same day, all the Hosts of the Lord went out of the Land of <HI>Egypt.</HI> Again, it is written, <HI>Rom.</HI> 5.13. For until the Law, sin was in the world; for whereas he saith, <HI>Ʋntil the Lam,</HI> he hath reference until this Law was given at <HI>Mount Sinai</HI> by <HI>Moses,</HI> his Argument is to prove, That sin was in the world before the giving of this Law; for, saith he, sin is not im∣puted when there is no Law; and in the following <HI>Verse,</HI> saith, Nevertheless Death reigned from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> even over them that had not sinned after the simili∣tude of <HI>Adams</HI> Transgression. So that it is evident sin was in the world from <HI>Adam</HI> till <HI>Moses,</HI> or rather until the Law was given by <HI>Moses.</HI> Again, he saith, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.14. For when the <HI>Gentiles</HI> which have not the Law, it is evident he points at this Law or Cove∣nant made with <HI>Israel</HI> (which the <HI>Gentiles</HI> had not) to shew, tho' they had it not, yet
<PB N="42" REF="001232_0050_0FB17CA1786D5BB8"/>they were not without a Law written in their hearts, by which Law God would judge them; for <HI>Adam</HI> had no sooner sinned but his eyes were opened, and a divine Light of the knowledge of good and evil shined in him, which is the moral Law, for that Law was spiritual and not litteral, tho' he was carnal, sold-under sin; and this is the true Light of Condemnation, that lighteth every man that cometh into the World; so that by this Law cometh the knowledge of sin, and makes all the World guilty before God, for all have sinned against this moral or so ri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ual Law which is written in their hearts.</P>

<PB N="44" REF="001232_0052_0FB17CA471D2E9D0"/>temporal Sabbath, of the same nature; which sign was to be observed throughout their Generations, to signifie that great Temporal Deliverance that they had by the hand of God, and thereby to remember, that they were Gods sanctified or chosen People, when they were come into the Land of Rest, out of the Furnace of Af∣fliction and hard Labour. So that this <HI>Weekly Seventh-Day Sabbath</HI> was to be a sign to <HI>Israel</HI> (in the Land of Rest) of their for∣mer Deliverance, and that while they kept Gods Law and Statutes they should rest quietly in the Land with all Plenty and Prosperity, and none should make them afraid</P>
<P>Now when they broke the Covenant of the Law, which was their Marriage Covenant with God, and went a whoring from him, it was then no sign of their quiet Rest in the Land, as appears by the Testimony of God by his Prophet <HI>Ezekiel, chap.</HI> 20. <HI>v.</HI> 5, 6.

<PB N="45" REF="001232_0053_0FB17CA5EC10F9B0"/>only upon Condition of Obedience in keep∣ing his Covenant, and so not pollute the Land of their Rest, after so great Deliver∣ance out of <HI>Egypt;</HI> but when they had pol∣luted the Land, then the Lord said unto them, <HI>Mic.</HI> 2.10. <HI>Arise ye and depart, for this is not your Rest, because it is polluted.</HI></P>
<P>Qu. <HI>What are we to understand by a Sign?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> We are to understand that a Sign is not the Substance; so the Seventh-Day Rest given to <HI>Israel,</HI> after that Deliverance out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> was to be a sign to them, that while they did not defile their Sanctification, they should no more go into such Bondage, but rest quietly in the Land from the fear of evil. So that the seventh Day Rest was a sign to them of a perpetual Rest in their Land, from the Oppression of their Enemies, till that Prophet should come, which <HI>Moses</HI> told them of, <HI>Acts</HI> 3.22. whom they were to hear in all things, who was appointed of God to be a Saviour and a Delivered out of a spiritual Bondage, <HI>John</HI> 8.36. and to give a spiritual and eternal Rest to his People, <HI>Mat.</HI> 11.28, 29. which is the Substance of those things shadowed out in the first Te∣stament or Covenant.</P>
<P>Qu. <HI>Do you not think that</HI> Adam <HI>in his state of Innocency, kept a weekly Seventh-Day Sabbath?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="001232_0054_0FB17CA831BB4320"/>
<HI>Answ.</HI> No; for he had no need of a sign or shadow of a better thing, while in the state of perfect Happiness; and besides that, it speaks only of Gods resting from his Works of Creation, which was finished in six days, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2 2 <HI>Heb.</HI> 4 4. and <HI>A am</HI> was the last Work that was made on the sixth Day and the seventh Day of Gods Rest, was his perpetual Cessation from all his Works, and not to be understood a Day of Evening and Morning, and so when that was ended, for God to begin another Work.</P>
<P>And as to the <HI>Seventh Day, Adam</HI> enter'd upon it in his first Creation, so that it was not a 7th Day Rest to him from any Labour, for he had done none.</P>
<P>Qu <HI>Why <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> mention <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Works of Crea∣tion, and his resting from it in the fourth Com∣mandment?</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Because <HI>Israel,</HI> his chosen People, whom he had delivered out of that hard Labour in <HI>Egypt,</HI> might look on that happy state of man in his first Creation, and con∣sider; how that through his Disobedience he brought this Labour and Sorrow upon him∣self and that they might (by that tempo∣ral Deliverance out of <HI>Egypt</HI> by the hand of <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ses</HI>) hope for a second <HI>Adam</HI> who should do the Will of God by a perfect Obedience, and then suffer under that Law or Covenant,

<P>To which <HI>I Answer;</HI> It is very true, the Wife is bound (by the Law) to her Husband so long as he liveth, but if the Husband be dead, she is no Adulteress tho' she be mar∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to another man; but if while her Hus∣band

<PB N="51" REF="001232_0059_0FB17CB02E685B18"/>that we might become dead to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Righteousness; for they that are Christ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> indeed have crucified the flesh with the af∣fections and lusts; so that we are made fre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> from sin by Jesus Christ: Let us therefore stand fast in that liberty where-with Christ hath made us free; for the Law hath Do∣minion only over the Body of sin; so then if the body of sin be crucified, dead and buried with Christ, and We be risen with him, We are not under the Law but under Grace; shall We then continue in sin, because We are not under the law, but under grace? God forbid; fo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> how can We that are dead to sin, live any longer in sin?</P>
<P>Now the first Covenant commanded <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> temporal Sabbath to be kept, which Sabbath was a sign; but in the New Covenant is con∣tained the Sabbath it self, which remains to the People of God. The first Covenant gave an Earthly Inheritance, but if we be Christs, then are we Heirs of God, yea, joynt Heirs with Christ of a better Inheri∣tance, which is contained in the New Cove∣nant. So that Christ is the Mediator of a better Covenant, established upon better Promises; for if the first Covenant had been without fault, there had been no place for a second; for God finds fault with them, saying, My
<PB N="52" REF="001232_0060_0FB17CB129BB22D0"/>Covenant they brake, altho' I was an hus∣band unto them. So that fault was found both with the Covenant, and Church or Wife; with the Church for the Breach of it, and with the Covenant, because there was no remission of sins in that Covenant of the Law; <HI>Deut.</HI> 27.26. Cursed be he that continueth not in all the Words of this Law to do them; therefore, saith the Lord, I will make a New Covenant with the House of <HI>Israel</HI> and with the House of <HI>Judah,</HI> not according to the Covenant that I made with their Fathers in the Day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> because they continued not in my Covenant, and I regarded them not, saith the Lord; for this is the Covenant that I will make with the House of <HI>Israel,</HI> After those days, saith the Lord, I will put my Laws into their Mind, and Write them on their Hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a People; and they shall not teach every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, saying, Know the Lord, for all shall know me from the least to the greatest; for I will be merciful to their Unrighteousness, and their Sins and Iniquities will I remember no more. In that he saith a New Covenant, he hath made the first Old. Now that which decayeth
<PB N="53" REF="001232_0061_0FB17CB2F5FEE428"/>and wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth old is ready to vanish away, saith the Apostle; Which plainly imports, the first is vanished away, that the second may be established.</P>
<P>Now the first Covenant did contain the Will of the Husband, in giving an Inheri∣tance to his Children, and withal giving them a charge to Obedience, saying, <HI>Hor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> thy Father and thy Mother, that thy Days may be long in the Land which the Lord thy God giveth thee.</HI> Here was an Inheritance given by a Will or Testament, but this was not the Saints Inheritance, but a figure of it, tho' this Covenant was not dedicated without the Blood of Beasts, as a figure; for a mans Testament or Will is of no force while the Testator is alive; but the New Testament of Jesus Christ was dedicated with his own Blood, who through the eternal Spirit of∣fered himself without spot to God; This Sacrifice doth purge our Conscience from dead Works of the Law, to serve the living God; and for this cause he is a Mediator of the New Testament; so that by the means of his Death, for the Redemption of the Transgressions that were under the first Te∣stament, they which are called might re∣ceive the Promise of an eternal Inheritance, which eternal Inheritance is the substance of that Inheritance contained in the first
<PB N="54" REF="001232_0062_0FB17CB55D2D1DC0"/>Testament given at <HI>Mount Sinai.</HI> And it is easier for Heaven and Earth to pass, than one Tittle of the <HI>Levitical Law</HI> to fail; for Christ came not to destroy it, but to fullfil it in every jot and tittle of it, and also to fullfil in us the Righteousness of that Law Written on the Tables of Stone, called, the Old Testament or Covenant, and to bring us into that Rest which <HI>Adam</HI> by Transgres∣sion lost. So that in the first Covenant there was only contained a Temporal Sab∣bath, which was but a sign or shadow; and there was Will'd an Inheritant, but it was but the earthly <HI>Canaan;</HI> there was a Law of Obedience, but it allowed no Mercy to the Transgressor, neither did it afford any strength to the sinner, in that it was Weak, neither did it minister Righteousness to the Soul, so that it was altogether helpless.</P>
<P>But in the New Covenant is contained the Substance of those things; for in it We have the Remission of sins by the Blood of Christ, figured out under the first Covenant by the Blood of Beasts, and the gift of that Righteousness required in the <HI>Law;</HI> it gives us strength against sin; for by it We have the gift of the Spirit of God, by which we mortifie the Deeds of the Body, and without which we can no ways serve God acceptably, Which Spirit Witne<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>leth with our spirits;
<PB N="55" REF="001232_0063_0FB17CB72C1B7160"/>that We are the Children of God; for by it We are adopted and made Heirs of the heavenly <HI>Canaan,</HI> typi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>led in the First Cove∣nant, Which Inheritance was before pro∣mised to <HI>Abraham's</HI> fleshly Seed, and it commanded a typical Sabbath, or a Sabbath that was a Sign, but the New Testament gives us the Substance of these things, even the Everlasting Sabbath, there signified by a sign in the Covenant of the <HI>Law.</HI></P>
<P>Upon the consideration of these things. We ought to give the more earnest heed; for if the Word spoke by Angels and Writ upon Stone, was stedfast, and every Trans∣gression of Disobedience received a just Re∣compence of Reward, how then shall We escape, if We neglect so great Salvation by Jesus Christ! Seeing he that despised <HI>Moses</HI> Law, dyed without Mercy, how much greater Punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought worthy of, that sets light by the Covenant of Grace, by which Covenant We are sanctified, and the Rule of our Obedi∣ence therein contained, is Written by the Spirit of God on the fleshly Tables of our hearts, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.3. so that We have no need to be taught but as this anointing of the Spirit teacheth Us; for it is written (speak∣ing of the New Covenant) <HI>They shall be all taught of God</HI> (<HI>John</HI> 6.45. <HI>Heb.</HI> 8, 11.1 <HI>Joh.</HI>
<PB N="56" REF="001232_0064_0FB17CB8A8DA6790"/>2.26, 27.) <HI>from the least of them to the greatest;</HI> for in this Covenant is free Remis∣sion of sins by the Blood of Jesus Christ, and Sanctification by the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who hath received of the Father the Promise of the Spirit, and sent it into our hearts, that it may be our Leader &amp; Guide, and through the gift of this Treasure which we have in our earthen Vessels, he hath made us Ministers of the New Testament or Covenant, not of the Letter, written and engraven on Stone, but of the Spirit; for the Letter, written on the Tables of the first Covenant, ministred only Death, but the Spirit ministreth Life and Peace; so that the Ministration of Jesus Christ, in the New Covenant, ministring Righteous∣ness to the sinner, and so justifying the Un∣godly through Faith, is more glorious than the Ministration of Condemnation in the old Covenant, which ministred only Death and Condemnation to the sinner, so that Gods Justice was therein to be seen; but in the New Covenant his rich Mercy and infi∣nite Grace in Christ Jesus is seen.</P>
<P><HI>Beloved Brethren,</HI> I am sensible that the Minds of many are blinded, and there is a Vail of Darkness upon their hearts, in the reading of the Old Covenant so that they
<PB N="57" REF="001232_0065_0FB17CBA2CE940E0"/>cannot see what is abolished; but when their heart shall turn to the Lord, that Vail of Darkness shall be taken away, and then they will come to behold the Glory of the Lord in the New Covenant; for where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is Light and Liberty to behold his Glory; for the Lord is that Spirit in his Divine Nature, and the Saints Bodies are his Temple and Sanctuary where he dwells; for there the <HI>pure in heart shall s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e him;</HI> for as the Tables of the Old Co∣venant were Stone, so the Tables of the New Covenant are the <HI>fleshly</HI> hearts of Gods Chil∣dren; and as the Law was engraven on those Tables, and put into an Ark, so the Righteousness of the Law is no where to be found but in Christ, and as our fleshly hearts are the Tables of the New Covenant, so Christ hath written the Law of our Obe∣dience to him there, and he in us is the Ark of Gods strength, and causeth our spi∣ritual Enemies to flee before him: And as the Ark of the first Covenant did contain the Doctrine of the Law, so the Ark of the New Testament contains the Doctrine of Christ; he that hath this Doctrine, and abideth in it, he hath both the Father and the Son dwelling in him; for the Saints Bodies are the Temple of the the New Te∣stament, where God dwells. Now the first
<PB N="58" REF="001232_0066_0FB17CBCD9F25968"/>Covenant had Ceremonies of divine Service, and a worldly Sanctuary (for there was a Tabernacle made with hands, which the <HI>Le∣vitical Priest-hood</HI> ministred in) but Christ is our great High-Priest, a Minister of the holy things and true Tabernacle, which God hath pitched, and not man, which Taber∣nacle is the Saints Bodies.</P>

<P>I Desire that these following things may be well considered.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> When God delivered the two Ta∣bles of Stone into the hand of <HI>Moses,</HI> he gave him a particular account about the Sabbath, how it was a Sign, as is to be seen <HI>Exod.</HI> 31. beginning at <HI>vers.</HI> 12. to the end of the <HI>Chapt.</HI> yea, it was a covenanted Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to that People, as is to be seen, <HI>vers.</HI> 16, 17, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 20.12, 20.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Moses</HI> testifieth it to <HI>Israel,</HI> that it was commanded to be kept upon the ac∣count of that Deliverance out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s to be seen <HI>Deut.</HI> 5. comparing the 12, 13,

<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Christ testifieth, That the Priests prophaned the Sabbath in the Temple, and yet were blameless, <HI>Mat.</HI> 12.5. compared with <HI>Numb.</HI> 28.9, 10. so that we may well conclude, those Sacrifices by which they prophaned the Sabbath with, tho' they were but signs themselves, yet the Sabbath, which was of less value, was to give place, that the greater might not be omitted.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The man that bore a burden on the Sabbath Day (to wit, his Bed, <HI>Joh</HI> 5.10.) prophaned it in so doing, and was as blame∣less as the Priests; for that Sign under the Law was not the Sabbath, any more than that Circumcision, commanded to <HI>Abraham,</HI> was the Circumcision, and therefore, saith the Apostle, That is not Circumcision that is outward in the flesh, <HI>Rom.</HI> 2.28. And again, saith he, <HI>Abraham</HI> received the sign of Circumcision, <HI>Rom</HI> 8 11. Thus we see he calls it the <HI>Sign</HI> of Circumcision, tho' the Scripture did no where call it a <HI>sign,</HI> but cal∣led
<PB N="60" REF="001232_0068_0FB17CC030648CC0"/>it Circumcision; but the <HI>7th Day Sabbath</HI> God declared it to be Sign, yea, a covenanted Sign with that People, as Circumcision was, as is to be seen, by comparing these two places of Scripture together, <HI>Exod.</HI> 31.16, 17. <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.</HI> 17.10, 13 &amp; 14 <HI>Verses.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> Seeing that God testi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ieth, that the Weekly 7th Day Sabbath is a Sign, and gave no such plain demonstration of any other of the Sabbaths under the Law, We have good and better reason to judge, that <HI>Pau<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'s</HI> words, <HI>Col.</HI> 2.16, 17. <HI>Let no man there∣fore judge you in Meat, or in Drink, or in respect of an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly Day, or of the New Moon, or of the Sabbath Days, which are a shodow of things to come, but the Body is of Christ</HI> comprehends the 7th Day Sabbath in a special manner, seeing it agrees with Gods Testimony to <HI>Israel,</HI> that it was a Sign to them, and a sign is not the Substance; for a shadow is but the sign of the Substance.</P>
<P>And <HI>lastly,</HI> Seeing that God testifieth to <HI>Israel,</HI> That the Weekly 7th-Day Sabbath was a sign, it was no more the Sabbath, than the seven stars which <HI>John</HI> saw in the right hand of Christ, was the Angel of the seven Churches, nor no more the Sabbath than the seven Golden Candlesticks was the seven Churches, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1.20. nor no more the Sab∣bath than those fat Kine that <HI>Pharoah</HI> saw,
<PB N="61" REF="001232_0069_0FB17CC1E3C8BC70"/><HI>Gen.</HI> 41.26. was the seven plentiful Years; which sort of Creature (we after read) they made an Image of and worshipped; nor no more the Sabbath than the sign of Circum∣cision was the <HI>Circumcision, Rom.</HI> 2.28 and <HI>ch.</HI> p. 4.11. nor no more the Sabbath (under the first Covenant) than the Wine that Christ gave his Disciples to drink, was the Blood of the New Testament or Covenant, <HI>Mat.</HI> 26.27, 28 nor no more the Sabbath, (under the first Testament) than the Bread that Christ gave to his Disciples, was his Body under the second or new Covenant, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.23, 24.</P>
<P>Thus We see that <HI>Signs</HI> (in the Scripture) bear the compleat Name of the Substance or Thing they signifie; so the <HI>7th-Day Sabbath</HI> was a Sign under the first Covenant, and so continued till the establishment of the se∣cond, and then both the Covenant and Signs under it ceased; for they were signs of Instruction to the Church, that they might impose their Faith on the things they signi∣fied, which were to be fulfilled by Christ, who was the substance of them all; and so at his coming they were all nailed to his Cross, and so ceased, <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hes.</HI> 2.15, 16. <HI>Col.</HI> 2.14.

<HEAD>An Exposition upon several Places of Scripture, which the unlearned and un∣stable wrest (is they do also other places of Scripture) to their own Destruction.</HEAD>
<P>LAY not wait, O Wicked Man, against the Dwelling of the Righteous, neither spoil thou his resting place; for a righteous Man all∣eth seven Times, and riseth again; but the Wick∣ed shall fall into Mischief, <HI>Prov. 24.15, 16.</HI></P>
<P>It is a common saying, that the Scripture saith, A righteous Man falleth into sin seven times a day, which false Report seems to be raised from this Text of Scripture, tho' it intends quite another thing, and not a falling into sin, as the Consequents of it make it appear; for, saith the Text, <HI>Lay not wait, O Wicked Man, against the Dwelling of the Righteous, neither spoil th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u his resting Place;</HI> It is evident that the dwelling of the Righteous is in God, who Pro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ects him, &amp; the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e is his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> place, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> sal.</HI> 91.1. From
<PB N="63" REF="001232_0071_0FB17CC4B08DD328"/>hence we may observe, that the holy Ghost cautions and forbids the Wicked man laving wait against the Dwelling of the Righteous, thinking thereby to spoil his resting place, which resting place is in God, upon this consideration, For a righteous man falleth seven times, and riseth up again; which implyes as much as if it should say, Tho' he should f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll before thee seven times, yet shall he rise up again; for his state is not like the Wicked, for the Wicked when they come to fall, it is into Mischief. so that this place of Scripture doth not at all intend falling into sin, but into Perils, through the means of the Wicked, but they shall rise up again; for it is written, <HI>Micah</HI> 7.8. <HI>Re∣joyce not against me, O mine Enemy; when I fall I shall arise,</HI> Isa. 54.17. <HI>No Weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper.</HI></P>
<P>Another place of Scripture, which is grosly wrested, is 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.9, 10. where the Lord saith to <HI>Paul, My strength is made perfect in weakness;</HI> they say, <HI>Paul</HI>'s weakeness and infirmities (there mentioned) is meant, sin, which in so saving they make <HI>Paul</HI> seem very abominable; for he saith most gladly, <HI>Therefore will I rather glory in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y I firmitie.</HI> What! did <HI>Paul</HI> take pleasure in Wickedness, and most gladly glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="64" REF="001232_0072_0FB17CC657EB3EC8"/>it? Surely Nay. And after this manner do they wrest the Scripture to their own De∣struction.</P>
<P>Whenas this place of Scripture doth plainly shew, that the faithful Children of God, who are perfected in the Doctrine of Christ, do come to obtain a perfect strength against the Power of sin, as appeareth by comparing <HI>vers.</HI> 7. with the 8 &amp; 9 <HI>verses;</HI> for faith <HI>Paul, And lest I should be exalted above measure, through the abundance of Reve∣lation, there was given me a Thorn in the flesh, the Messenger of Satan to buffer me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</HI> From hence we may observe, That <HI>Paul</HI> had abundance of Revelations, and left he should be exalted above measure, through them, there was given him a Thorn in the flesh, which was the Messenger of Satan, to buffet him, which was some evil Motions working in his fleshly Body, which he compareth to a Thorn in the flesh, which will terrifie a man till he can get rid of it; and the end of God in exercising <HI>Paul</HI> under these Temptations, was, that he might not be exalted in him∣self, but might learn by them the Doctrine of Humility; These Temptations or evil Motions that did work in <HI>Paul</HI>'s flesh, he found to be too strong for him to with∣stand, and therefore besought the Lord,
<PB N="65" REF="001232_0073_0FB17CC90F345198"/>that it might depart from him; the answer of the Lord to him, was, <HI>My Grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.</HI> Thus we may see how God was pleased to exercise <HI>Paul,</HI> to humble and abase him, under the fence of his own weak∣ness and infirmities, and then in shewing him most graciously his All-sufficiency, in making his own strength appear perfectly in <HI>Paul,</HI> and thereby giving him the Victory. From hence we may Note, That when Pride was in <HI>Paul</HI> he was under the buffeting War∣fare, but when he was humbled under it, ann by it had learned Humility, then God revealed his perfect strength in him, and gave him the Victory over the power of sin; and when <HI>Paul</HI> came thus to see his own weakness, not being able to with-stand the power of sin, he was greatly abased and humbled, and did glory in the sight that he had obtained of himself: And thus he comes not to glory in himself, any otherwise than in the sight that he had obtained of his own weakness and infirmities, that the power of Christ might rest on him, by gi∣ving him Gods perfect strength, against the Motions of sin; and when <HI>Paul</HI> had attain∣ed to this Learning, rightly to know his own weakness and infirmities, so as to glory in them, being abased in himself, lowly and
<PB N="66" REF="001232_0074_0FB17CC9E876D360"/>humble, and to know the Almighty Power of God, and his readiness to help the humble and lowly in time of need; then did he come (as in the <HI>10th verse</HI>) to take pleasure in Infirmities, in Reproaches, in Necessi∣ties, in Persecutions, and in Distresses for Christs sake; for when I am weak (saith he) then am I strong, that is, because he sees his own Weakness, and is humble and lowly in himself, but is strong by Faith in God, whom he knows will give him the Victory; so that when he is thus Weak in himself, then is he strong in God by Faith.</P>
<P>From this recorded Experience of <HI>Paul,</HI> it is our Wisdom to learn of Christ, who was meek and lowly in heart, and then we shall find Rest, as <HI>Paul</HI> did, by Gods perfect strength that did appear in him, against the strength and powerful Motions of Sin, un∣der which Warfair he could not rest quietly, for it was like a pricking Bryar or grieving Thom in the flesh, which was suffered of God so to be, to teach him Humility, in see∣ing his own Weakness and Gods Strength made perfect in him; and thus he comes to glory in those two fore-mentioned things. And this is the Saints Perfection in this Life, even when Gods strength is made perfect in us, against the power of sin. And this is the Perfection that I have born Wit∣ness
<PB N="67" REF="001232_0075_0FB17CCB69FCBBC8"/>to, for which I have suffered Repreach from such as never saw Gods strength at any time made perfect in them against the <HI>power</HI> of sin, neither will they believe the Truth of it, because the God of this World hath blinded their Eyes.</P>
<P>Another place greatly wrested, is in <HI>James</HI> 3, 2 <HI>For in many things we Offend all.</HI></P>
<P>Here ariseth a Question from this Text, <HI>What we are to understand by Offending all? Whether all the Church is here meant to Offend, or whether some particular Persons is here in∣tended to Offend all the Church?</HI></P>
<P>To which <HI>I Answer;</HI> The following words do answer the Question, being compared with <HI>Vers.</HI> 1. <HI>If any man Offend not in word, the same is a perfect Man, and able also to bridle the whole Body.</HI> From hence we may Note, that he speaks of Offending with the Tongue; for saith he, <HI>If any Man Offend not in word, the same is a perfect Man;</HI> com∣pare this with <HI>vers</HI> 1. which faith, <HI>My Bre∣thren, be not many Masters, knowing that we shall receive the greater Condemnation;</HI> which imports, Be not of a Domineering or Ma∣sterly Spirit, for such are apt to Offend all the Church of Christ in many things, with their ungovern'd Tongue; and whereas he faith, <HI>We shall receive the greater Damnation</HI>
<PB N="68" REF="001232_0076_0FB17CCCEA485358"/>that is to be understood, so many of us as are of an exalted Masterly Spirit, for it is such of us as Offend all, by not bridling our Tongue; for this Offending all is with an unbridled Tongue, as is to be seen in the 3d &amp; <HI>4th verses,</HI> compared with the 5 &amp; 6 <HI>verses,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>They mention also <HI>James</HI> 4.5. say they, the Apostle saith, That the Scripture saith, the Spirit that dwelleth in us, lusteth to envy; whenas the Apostle is speaking to Adulterers and Adulteresses, as in the fore∣going verse and is shewing to them what the Scripture saith of the Spirit that was in the adulterated old world, <HI>Gen.</HI> 6, 5. and is in all of us, that are gone out of Gods Spi∣rit, and got into the Spirit of the World, and so have gone a whoring from God.</P>
<P>They greatly wrest many passages of the Apostle <HI>Pauls</HI> words in the <HI>7th</HI> of the <HI>Romans,</HI> to their own destruction; for the Apostle is setting forth the miserable state of man, as he is in the flesh, and not in Christ, and he makes use of himself to set it forth, which is most proper and decent for a man rather to nominate hinself, to set forth the wretched, misrable and sinfull state of man, then to reflect it upon another
<PB N="69" REF="001232_0077_0FB17CCE8D292018"/>or upon them that are not yet delivered from that state.</P>
<P>But it will be objected, <HI>That</HI> Paul <HI>was a converted man when he wrot the said Chapter.</HI></P>
<P>To which <HI>I Answer;</HI> It is very true, for he was not in a <HI>wretched state,</HI> then wanting deliverance, or a carnal man sold under sin; as he there makes use of himself (as he was in his unconverted state) to open the miserable state of the unconverted man, sold under sin, beind in a wretched and undeli∣vered states as he there sets it forth, under the denomination of himself. Now when he hath ended the <HI>7th Chapter,</HI> having set forth the carnal, unconverted state of man, who is sold under sin, being in a wretched captivated state of Death, while he is in the flesh and not in Christ, so that tho' he willeth that which is good, yet he is so under the power of Satan, that he finds no ability to perform that which is good, by reason that there is the law of fin in his Membes, which law of fin proceeds from the Kingdom of Satan, and warreth against the law of his mind, and bringeth him into Captivity to the law of sin, which is in his Members, and make him cry out against his wretchedness, and state of Death that he is in, desiring deliverance, which can come only and alone by Jesus Christ, I say he
<PB REF="001232_0078_0FB17CD0CE742E18"/>having thus set forth the miserable state of man out of Christ, in the next place he sets forth the happy state of man in Christ, as throughout the 8 <HI>chap.</HI> which begins thus, There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit. But in the <HI>7th Chap.</HI> (faith he) for when we were in the flesh, the motions of sin which were by the law, did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death, <HI>v.</HI> 5. But in the <HI>8th Chap. v.</HI> 9. he saith to them that are in Christ, But ye are not in the flesh. In the <HI>7th Chap.</HI> 23.24 <HI>verses,</HI> he saith of the Unconverted, <HI>But I see another Law in my Members, waring against the Law of my Mind, and bringing me into Captivity to the Law of sin, which is in my Members, O wretched Man that I am! who shall deliver me from this Body of Death.</HI> In <HI>Chap.</HI> 8. <HI>v.</HI> 2. speak∣ing of a Converted state, he saith, The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the Law of sin and Death. In <HI>Chap.</HI> 7. <HI>v.</HI> 14. speaking of the Unconverted state of Man, he saith, For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin. In <HI>Chap.</HI> 8. <HI>vers.</HI> 6, 7. to set forth the miserable state of the carnal Man, he saith, To be carnally mind∣ed is Death, because the carnal Mind is
<PB REF="001232_0079_0FB17CD2945DE5D0"/>Enmity against God, for it is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. In <HI>Chap.</HI> 7. <HI>v.</HI> 15. he sheweth, That an un∣converted state is a state of Bondage and Slavery, for a man doth that which he al∣lows not, and what he would do, that he doth not; and what he hateth, that he doth; all which sheweth, he is under the power of sin; this state cannot but be at∣tended with a Spirit of Bondage, to fear Gods Wrath. But in <HI>Chap.</HI> 8.15, 16, &amp; 17 <HI>Verses,</HI> he sheweth, That the Converted hath not the Spirit of Fear, but hath the Spirit of Adoption, and can call God Father, by the Witness of Gods own spirit, which reveals to the soul Gods Love, and gives the Soul a certain knowledge, that it is an Heir of eternal Life, by the immediate Witness and Revelation of God and every one that believes hath this Witness of God in himself, 1 <HI>John</HI> 5.9, 10. <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.16. Thus it appears, according to the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI>'s Testimony, That there be some that wrest <HI>Paul's</HI> Writings to their own De∣struction, as they do also other Scriptures, 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.15, 16.</P>
<P>Another Scripture which they wrest, to maintain a sinning Life, is <HI>Gal.</HI> 5.17. <HI>For the Flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit
<PB REF="001232_0080_0FB17CD3ACF7DB28"/>against the Flesh, and these are contrary the one to the other, so that ye cannot do the things that ye would.</HI></P>
<P>Look but into the fore-going Verse, and it will shew the reason why these could not do the things they would, and why this Battle did arise in them, to wit, the flesh against the spirit, for the Spirit of God in them did not want strength to overcome and to mor∣tifie the deeds of the Body, and to have given them the Victory through Faith in God, but they were Disobedient Children, and did not walk in the Spirit, but did bite and devour one another, as in the 15 <HI>vers.</HI> which Contention did arise through Pride, contending about the Works of the Law; for it is written, <HI>Only through Pride cometh Contention;</HI> had they been sowing to the Spirit, they would have reaped the fruit of Peace, as in the <HI>22th vers.</HI> and not of War in themselves, but they sowing to the flesh, did cause a War in themselves, and one against another; for as in <HI>vers.</HI> 24. They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts. Now when the flesh is crucified, dead and buried how can it make war against the Spirit, any more than a dead man can make war against a living man? <HI>Rom.</HI> 6.6, 7, 8. compared with <HI>v.</HI> 11.1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 4.1, 2, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.20,
<PB N="73" REF="001232_0081_0FB17CD532781310"/>but while Humility is wanting, that Soul cannot expect a perfect Rest and Peace; for if it should enjoy that, Pride would encrease, and therefore God doth not reveal in such a one his perfect strength, but lets them labour to humble them, that they may not glory in themselves, but in him who gives them strength.</P>
<P>Another Scripture which they wrest, to defend the power and authority of sin, is 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.8 <HI>If we say that me have no sin, we deceive our selves, and the Truth is not in us.</HI></P>
<P>It will appear plainly that this Scripture is spoken to the unconverted, yea, this whole Chapter is written, not to the Belie∣ver, but to the Unbeliever, as thus appears in the <HI>3d vers</HI> saith he, <HI>That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with Ʋs;</HI> This [<HI>Ʋs</HI>] is the Saints, which were come into fellowship al∣ready with the Father and with h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Son J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sus Christ; but he writes to such as yet had not fellowship with [<HI>Ʋs</HI>] that is to say, the Saints; for, saith he, that which we have seen and heard, declare We unto You, that Ye [<HI>also</HI>] may have fellowship with Us; The Word [<HI>also</HI>] imports, as We are come into fellowship with God, so We desire, that Ye [<HI>also</HI>] may come into this fellow∣ship
<PB N="74" REF="001232_0082_0FB17CD6D1702068"/>with us. So that it appears plainly, that he writes to such as were not yet come into fellowship with the Saints. The truth of this also appears in the <HI>9th Vers.</HI> If We confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all Unrighteousness. From whence it ap∣pears, that these to whom he writes, had not yet made confession of their sins, neither were cleansed from all Unrighteousness; but it is evident that <HI>John</HI> had confessed his sins, and that God had been faithful and just to forgive him his sins, and had cleans∣ed him from all unrighteousness. It is also evident, that all those that are cleansed from all unrighteousness, walk in a clear Light, and therefore have a perfect sight that they are Gods Children; for it is the ingrafted Spirit of Truth in their hearts that sanctifies them; so that it is evident, whosoever con∣ceits that they have fellowship with God, and are not in this Light, they do but de∣ceive themselves, as appeareth in the 5, 6 &amp; 7 <HI>Verses,</HI> and are not cleansed from their sins by the Blood or Jesus Christ; and for such to say they have no sin, do but deceive themselves, and the Truth is not in them, or say, they have not sinned, they make him a lyar, and his Word is not in them; for they being in a state of Darkness, it is
<PB N="75" REF="001232_0083_0FB17CD848CB1940"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> evidence, that they are alienated from the Life of God, and that his living Word is not in them</P>
<P>This Apostle <HI>John</HI> doth not in this first Chap∣ter use the Word [<HI>Ʋs</HI>] only to his Brethren in Christ, but also to his Brethren after the flesh, as being his fellow Creatures which he writes to. And in the beginning of the se∣cond Chapter he writes to Babes in Christ, and after to Fathers and Young Men, yea, to all sorts and degrees of <HI>Christians,</HI> thro'∣out the rest of his Epistle, but in this Chap∣ter only to Unbelievers.</P>
<P>Another place of Scripture which they wrest, to uphold a continuance in sin, or at least to confirm it to be a truth, that none <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an live free from sin, while in the Land of the living, which place is <HI>Eccles. 7.20. For there is not a just Man upon Earth, that doth good, and sinneth not.</HI></P>
<P>To which <HI>I Answer;</HI> If there were a just man upon Earth, that doth good, &amp; sinneth not, that man stands in no need of a Saviour, for Christ did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to Repentance; for boasting could not be excluded from this man, be∣cause his Salvation would not be of Grace, but of Debt, for he would have no need to be beholding to God for the forgive∣ness
<PB N="76" REF="001232_0084_0FB17CDB33AC4D50"/>of sin, because he never had sinned; but as <HI>Solemen</HI> faith, There was never such a man since the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll of <HI>Adam,</HI> save Jesus Christ only. Look upon the <HI>15th verse</HI> of this <HI>Chap.</HI> and thou mayst see what just Man this is he speaks of: <HI>There is a just Man</HI> (saith he) <HI>that perisheth in his Righteousness.</HI> So that it is evident, that this just Mans Righteous∣ness, which he speaks of, is not the Righ∣teousness of Christ, which is by Faith, but a Self-Righteousness; but this doth not confute the Apostle <HI>John</HI>'s Testimony, who saith, If we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all Unrighteousness, 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.9. Neither doth it confute what he further saith, Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin, for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God, 1 <HI>John</HI> 3.9.</P>
<P><HI>Jer. 10.25.</HI> Pour out thy sury upon the <HI>Heathen</HI> that know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name, for they have eaten up <HI>Jacob,</HI> and devoured him, and consu∣med him, and have made his Habitation desolate.</P>
<P>Here are several observable things in this Text. <HI>First,</HI> The Prophet seems to interceed against these <HI>Heathen</HI> and Families, saying, Pour out thy fury upon the <HI>Heathen</HI> that
<PB N="77" REF="001232_0085_0FB17CDCAB0D7818"/>know thee not, and upon the families that call not on thy name: <HI>Secondly,</HI> He gives the reason why, because (saith he) they have eaten up <HI>Jacob,</HI> &amp; devoured him</P>
<P>Here ariseth a question or two, first, What Families were those that eat up <HI>Jacob,</HI> and devoured him, and consumed him, and made his habitation desolate, and yet called not upon the Name of the Lord?</P>
<P>To which <HI>I A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swer;</HI> These families were the Kingdoms of the Earth, as appeareth by these Scriptures, <HI>Jer.</HI> 1 15. For <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o I will call all the Families of the Kingdoms of the North, faith the Lord, and they shallcome, &amp; they shall set every one his Throne at the c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tring of the gates of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> against all the Walls thereof round about, &amp; against all the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of <HI>Judah, Amos</HI> 3.1.2. hear this Word which the Lord hath spoken against you, O Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> against the whole Family which I brought up from the land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> saying, you only have I known of all the Families of the Earth, therefore will I punish you for all your Iniquities. Here the whole Nation of <HI>Israel</HI> is called a Family, in opposition to all the kingdoms or Families of the Earth. Again, in <HI>Zach.</HI> 14.18. <HI>Egypt</HI> is called a Family; but this Prophet <HI>Jere∣miah</HI> in this place speaketh after the manner of <HI>Asaph,</HI> Psal. 79.6.7. Pour out thy Wrath
<PB N="78" REF="001232_0086_0FB17CDE2FC460D8"/>upon the <HI>Heathen</HI> that have not known thee, and upon the Kingdoms that have not called upon thy Name; for they have devoured <HI>Jacob,</HI> and laid waste his dwelling place. From hence we may see these Families were the Kingdoms of the Earth, that devoured <HI>Jacob,</HI> and laid waste his dwelling place, and yet called not upon the Name of the Lord; for had they known God, and called upon his Name, as <HI>Israel</HI> did, only with the mouth and lips, then they would have been as bad Hypocrites as they were, but they knew him not, and therefore called not upon his Name at all; for it is better of the two, not to call upon the Name of God at all, then to call upon his name with the mouth and lips only, without any amend∣ment of Life, for this is high Hypocrisie, and abominable deceit in the sight of God; for it is adding hypocrisie to sin; for it is like a disobedient servant that goes about to curry favour with his Master by flattery, which is a double Provocation.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Why did God suffer these Fa∣milies or Kingdoms of the Earth to devour <HI>Jacob,</HI> and lay waste his dwelling-place?</P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> Because <HI>Israel</HI> lived in their sins, and did not endeavour to Repent or amend their ways, but were in such a state of blindness that they thought it was pleasing
<PB N="79" REF="001232_0087_0FB17CDFB4AC3CD8"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God, for them to approach before God at their set times of Prayer, with their Mouthes and Lips, while they lived in their sins, and they seemed to themselves more holy than others, by reason of these hypocritical Prayers which they thought was their Duty, tho' living in their sins, whenas it was but adding sin to sin, and doing only by the sug∣gestions of Satan, to flatter God while they served sin. <HI>Amos</HI> 4.4. Come to <HI>Bethel,</HI> and transgress at <HI>Gilgall,</HI> multiply Transgres∣sions, and bring your Sacrifices every morn∣ing; compare this with <HI>v. 6. &amp;c.</HI> And I also have given you cleanness of Teeth in all your Cities, and want of Bread in all your Palaces, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> As much as if the Lord should say, As you have dealt with me, so have I dealt with you; you lived in your sins, and yet attend your praying Custom every morning. <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.11, 12. To what purpose is the Multitude of your Sacrifices, to me (faith the Lord) when <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e come to appear before me? who hath required this at your hand? As much as if God should say, It is not that which I require at your hand; but, saith he, (<HI>vers.</HI> 16.) Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from be∣fore mine Eyes: As much as if he should say, It is Truth and Righteousness in the inner man that I require of you, and not
<PB N="80" REF="001232_0088_0FB17CE12E8A3AF8"/>your flattering by pocritical Prayers. <HI>Hos.</HI> 6.6. For I desired Mercy and not Sacrifice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt Offerings. <HI>Jer.</HI> 7.21, 22. Thus faith the Lord of Hosts the God of <HI>Israel,</HI> Put your burnt Offerings to your Sacrifices, and eat flesh, for I spake not onto your Fathers, nor commanded them, in the day that I brought them out of the Land of <HI>Egypt,</HI> con∣cerning burnt Offerings or Sacrifices, but this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my Voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my People, and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you. Thus we see Prayer is of no use without a Conversation answer∣able thereunto; for the Prayer of the wick∣ed is an Abomination to the Lord, <HI>Prov.</HI> 15.8. <HI>chap.</HI> 21.27. and saith <HI>David,</HI> If I regard Iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me, <HI>Psal.</HI> 66.18. and such a wicked praying People as these who offer abomina∣tion to the Lord, for their Prayers are so faith the Scripture, and therefore, faith the Lord, these are a smoke in my Nose, a fire that burneth all the day; so that Gods anger was very hot against this sinful praying People; so that he made use of the <HI>Heathen</HI> that knew him not, and the Kingdoms or Families that call'd not upon his Name, to
<PB N="81" REF="001232_0089_0FB17CE3B5BFD3A0"/>eat them up and devour them, and make their Habitation desolate, according to what God had before threatned them with, <HI>Isa.</HI> 10.5. O Affyrian, <HI>the Rod of mine Anger, and the Staff in their hand is mine Indignation, I will send him against an hypocritical Nation, and against the People of my Wrath; I will give him a charge to take the Spoil, and to take the Prey, and to tread them down like the Mire in the Streets.</HI> Isa. 33.14 <HI>The sinners in Zion are afraid, Fearfulness hath surprized the Hy∣pocrites.</HI> Thus did God threaten this pray∣ing People with sore Destruction, and that it should come upon them by the <HI>Heathen</HI> that knew him not, and therefore call'd not upon his Name; and this Prophet <HI>Jeremiah</HI> saw their destruction with his Eyes; for this hypocritical Nation drew near to God with their Mouth, and with their Lips did ho∣nour him at their set times of Prayer, and therefore Destruction came upon them by a People that knew not God, and therefore called not upon his Name; and when the Prophet saw this, that <HI>Jacob</HI> was eaten up and devoured, and consumed, and his Habi∣tation made desolate, he interceeds against them, That God would be pleased to pour out his Wrath upon them also; for they were sinners, tho' not such hypocritical sinners as the other was, for these knew not God.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="001232_0090_0FB17CE5BA5EDB18"/>
From hence we may note, That a smsti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hypocritical praying People, of all People are in the greatest danger of destruction from the hand of God, by some Calamity or other, before other sinners, that call not upon the Name of God at all, for they do not add hypocrisie to their sin, as these do, and these shall have their portion with the Hypocrites, there shall be weeping &amp; gnash∣ing of Teeth; for these are they which Christ distinguisheth his Disciples from, <HI>Mat. 6.5, 6. And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the Hypocrites are, for they love to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ray standing in the S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>agognes</HI> (that is, in a publick Assembly) <HI>to be seen of Men, verily, I say unto you, they have their Reward;</HI> but saith Christ to his Disciples (singling them out from these Hypocrite,) <HI>But thou shalt not be as the Hypocrite, but thou, when thou <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rayest enter into thy Closet, and when thou hast shut the door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father which seeth in secret shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eward thee openly.</HI> Thus Gods Children loose the Hypocrites Reward.</P>
<P>But it will be objected, <HI>That this is spoke of private Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>To which <HI>I Answer;</HI> It is true, if it be intended private from the ears of the world, but if it be intended, private from him that sees in secret, then it is false; for Christs
<PB N="83" REF="001232_0091_0FB17CE73099F0B8"/>Exhortation is, that it should be private from the ears of the world.</P>
<P>But it will be objected, <HI>That Christ says</HI> [Thou] <HI>which is in the singular Number.</HI></P>
<P>To which <HI>I Answer;</HI> That is true also, for Christ singles out his Disciples from Hypo∣crites, as he did <HI>Israel</HI> from other Nations, saying, <HI>I am the Lord Thy God which brought Thee out of the Land of</HI> Egypt; and yet it was to all his Church that he spoke, as he doth here to all his Disciples, to distinguish them out from Hypocrites.</P>

<P>THe taking away my lawful Wife, and other mens Wives, in this Colony of <HI>Connecticut</HI> in <HI>New-England,</HI> con∣trary to the Rule of Gods Word, is the reason of my publishing this Treatise of <HI>Marriage</HI> and <HI>Divorce.</HI></P>
<P>GEn. 1.27. <HI>So God created Man in his own Image, in the Image of God created he
<PB N="84" REF="001232_0092_0FB17CE8B00C6E28"/>him; Man and Female created by them.</HI> Thus was the Woman created in the Man, as ap∣pears in the <HI>5th Chap. v.</HI> 2. <HI>Male and Female created he them, and blessed them, and called their Name</HI> Adam. <HI>in the day when they were created.</HI> So that it appears they were cre∣ated in one Body, and were one flesh and bone, <HI>Mal.</HI> 2.15. And did not he make one? yet had he the residue of the Spirit. Thus we see God created the Man &amp; the Woman in one Body, yet had he the residue of the Spirit, and could have created him singly and distinct in two Bodies; Upon the con∣sideration of this, saith the Prophet, to the Husband, Therefore take heed to your Spirit, and let none deal treacherously with the Wife of his Youth; for the Lord, the God of <HI>Israel</HI> saith, that he hateth p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ting away. Which doth import, forasmuch as God created the Man and Woman in one Body; so that he made them one in their first Creation, and therefore hateth a Sepe∣ration, after they are united and become one flesh, by the Union of Marriage. <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.21, 22, 23. <HI>And the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon</HI> Adam, <HI>and he slept; and he took one of his Ribs, &amp; closed up the flesh instead thereof; and the Rib which the Lord God had taken from Man, builded he a Woman, and brought her unto the Man; and</HI> Adam <HI>said, This is now
<PB N="85" REF="001232_0093_0FB17CEA2C4DCC00"/>Bone of my Bones, and Flesh of my Flesh, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall be called</HI> Woman, <HI>because she was taken out of Man.</HI> Thus was the Woman taken taken out of the side of the Man, near his heart, and then brought to him by God, to be joyn'd to him again by a Marriage Union; and when <HI>Adam</HI> saw her, he said. This is now bone of my bones, &amp; flesh of my flesh, because she was of him, even taken out of him, and now brought to him again by God, to be joyned to him, and therefore (saith the Lord in the <HI>24th Verse</HI>) shall, a Man leave his Father and Mother, and cleave to his Wife, and they shall be one flesh: Thus hath God joyned them together, shewing, that a man shall leave his Father that begot him, and his Mother that brought him forth, and shall cleave to his Wife: So that God ordain'd a seperation from Father and Mo∣ther, but a perpetual Union between a Man and his Wife; they are to pass their days together by Gods decree, and none can se∣perate them, without high Contempt against Gods Authority, by violating his Ordinance of Marriage, for God hath thus joyn'd them together, and hath decree'd that a Man shall thus cleave to his Wife, and that she shall be subject to him, and not to another Man, and that her Husband shall rule over her; so that the Wife (by this Law of God) is
<PB N="86" REF="001232_0094_0FB17CEC255C3198"/>bound to her Husband so long as he liveth, (<HI>Rom.</HI> 7.2 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 7.39.) and by no means can be loosed from this Bond of Union and Subjection to her Husband, without the breach of Wedlock, which in Scripture, the Punishment is equall'd with the punishment of Murder, <HI>Ezek.</HI> 16.38. <HI>And I will judge thee as Women that break Wedlock and shed Blood are judged.</HI></P>
<P>But may there not be such Marriages as are not of God, and therefore may lawfully be separated? Yes, there may, but the se∣peration must be only granted by the Man, and upon no other cause than Fornication, because God made Man in his own Image, so that he is the image and glory of God, but the Woman is the glory of the Man; for the Man was not created for the Woman, but the Woman for the Man, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.7, 9. So that God brought the Woman and gave her to the Man, that he might be her Lord and Governour, <HI>Gen.</HI> 2.22, <HI>Chap.</HI> 3.12, 16. So that she was given to him to be a glory to him, as the Church is given to Christ, <HI>John</HI> 10.29. <HI>chap.</HI> 17.6. she is his peculiar Treasure in this Life; for she is given to him by God himself, and is his only peculiar Treasure, next to his Heart, and none can take that from him which God hath given to him, without the greatest Unjustice in

<P>Neither can a man lawfully himself put away his Wife, but only upon a Marriage not made by God; for when God brought <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> to <HI>Adam</HI> she was a chaste Virgin, Un∣defiled, without any guile or deceit, and so <HI>Adam</HI> received her from the hand of God; for God puts no Harlot upon a man, instead of a Virgin or chaste Woman, to be his covenanted Wife: for it doth signifie the Mystical Union between Christ and his Church, who is presented to him as a chaste Virgin, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.2 as <HI>Eve</HI> was to <HI>Adam;</HI> but if a Man take a Woman to be his Wife, taking her for a Virgin or Chaste Woman, and when he hath taken her, finds that he is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heated, and that she hath committed For∣nication,
<PB N="88" REF="001232_0096_0FB17CEF11F81CE8"/>and is defiled, this Marriage is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God; for he is not the Author of dece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>; and therefore it is in the power of her Hus∣band to give her a Bill of Divorce, except <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> take her after he bath the knowledge of her Defilement, if so, then he may not put her away all his days; so that nothing is accepted by which a man may put away his Wife, save Fornication only; and this Do∣ctrine Christ taught to his Disciples, in h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Sermon upon the Mount, limiting a Divorce only upon this one thing, <HI>Mat.</HI> 5.31, 32: <HI>It hath been said, Whosoever putteth away his Wife, let him give her a Writing of Divorce∣ment; but I say unto you, that whosoever shall put away his Wife, saving for the cause of For∣nication, causeth her to commit Adultery.</HI> Here Christ condemns all manner of Seperation▪ where the Marriage is of God, and plainly testifieth, That he that puteth away his Wife, causeth her to commit Adultery<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and be that marrys her commits Adultery also.</P>
<P>The Lord in his Doctrine to his Disciples thus makes void that liberty of Divorce that <HI>Moses</HI> gave under the Covenant of the Law to <HI>Israel;</HI> after this the Pharisees came also to him, tempting him, <HI>Mat.</HI> 19.3. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and saying unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his Wife for every cause?
