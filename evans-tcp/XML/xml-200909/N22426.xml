<HEAD>TO THE PUBLIC, ALIAS <HI>THE "SWINISH MULTITUDE."</HI></HEAD>
<P>OYE factious, seditious, and discontented crew! will you never believe that you are <HI>happy,</HI> when no more than a <HI>bare belief</HI> is requisite to make you so?— Infatuated mortals! are you determined, like Love∣gold, to "<HI>feel, feel, feel,</HI> and <HI>touch, touch, touch,"</HI> before you will allow your happiness to be real? Dreadful obstinacy! how unacquainted are you with the won∣der-working powers of <HI>imagination!</HI>—Can you not be∣lieve that your hunger and thirst are gratified, unless you <HI>eat</HI> and <HI>drink?</HI> Can you not believe that you are cloathed and warm, unless you are covered from the inclemency of the season?—O what political unbelief is this?—To what then must your wise legislators have recourse? they have bawled to you till their lungs are jaded; they have written to you till words are ex∣hausted, and ye still obstinately continue to be <HI>unhappy.</HI> What! will you not believe the King himself, and all the Royal Family? Not believe the Prime Minister,
<PB N="vi" REF="029629_0004_0FE20BF0F0CF50C8"/>the <HI>Privy</HI>-Council, and all the Bishops! the Judges, Counsellors, and Lawyers! the Borough-Mongers, the Placemen, and all the Pensioners! the Dukes and the Earls, and Marquisses, the Barons, the Knights, the Lords in Waiting of the Bed-chamber, of the Stole, and, of the Golden Stick! the Commanders by Sea, and Land; the Commissioners and Officers of all the great Houses! the Magistrates and Justices, the Lord-Mayor of London, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Mrs. Jordan, the Duke of Brunswick, the Duke of Rich∣mond, and all the Vestrymen, and Parish Officers!! —Deluded multitude! here is a collection of the <HI>happiest</HI> creatures in the world, united together to pur∣suade you that you are extremely <HI>happy,</HI> and yet you give no credit to what they may either <HI>say</HI> or <HI>swear!</HI> O shocking stupidity! they will then cure you of your Malady, by a different process; the Tower shall be furnished with solid argument, a Military system of Animal Magnetism shall be adopted—you shall be thrown into a <HI>Crisis,</HI> and kept there till you confess you are exceedingly <HI>happy!</HI>—Think, besotted creatures! how much money is now expending to pursuade you that you are happy! on <HI>Fortifications,</HI> on <HI>Proclamations,</HI> on <HI>Newspapers,</HI> at <HI>Taverns</HI> and <HI>Committees,</HI> as much as would liberate all the Insolvent Debtors in the four counties! Think, think, I say, and be persuaded you <HI>are happy,</HI> for you must pay all the Reckoning!</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="029629_0005_0FE20BF40E5D6DE0"/>
Again, how will you be able to resist the irrefutable logic of <HI>Musquetry</HI> and <HI>Artillery?</HI> or how will you be able to deny you are HAPPY, when the <HI>sword</HI> is pointed to your breast? recollect how successfully Mahomet ar∣gued this way, and believe you are happy in this world, lest they silence your murmurs, by sending you into another, to search for happiness! but alas you are a banditti of incorrigible Heretics: I know you will not believe you are <HI>happy,</HI> although the Holiest Man in Canterbury were to declare it to you on his marrow∣bones!</P>
<P>But let me, for a few moments, direct your attention to the great scource of all your happiness; to the most <HI>glorious</HI> and <HI>happy Constitution!</HI>—Take a view of each well con∣structed system in each department of government; and you <HI>may</HI> be astonished at the scence thrown open before you! The whole is a Paradise of Delights!</P>
<P>Look into the STATE!—'Tis true it has <HI>corrup∣tions</HI> and <HI>defects,</HI> as <HI>poor Edmund</HI> says, and you must peep at them with <HI>due caution</HI>—But see your <HI>Liberties</HI> de∣fended, your property protected, by men of the most <HI>unsullied virtue.</HI> The great Treasury of the Nation, which is accumulated from <HI>your</HI> hard labour and indus∣try, is entrusted to <HI>integrity</HI> itself; and distributed with the most scrupulous exactness, on the pure principles of the RIGHTS OF MAN. The most favourite <HI>Pensionors</HI> cannot finger a guinea till he has <HI>earnt it;</HI> nor has the most exalted man in office a single <HI>shilling more</HI> than his <HI>merit</HI> entitles him to. What is £ 4000.
<PB N="viii" REF="029629_0006_0FE20BF5A0DB9B18"/>per annum to one <HI>great man,</HI> for introducing another great man to kiss a <HI>Third Great Man's Hand?</HI>—'tis cheap as dirt. Nay it is worth half the money to see them at work!—in time of war you pay double taxes, and is it not necessary the expences of war should be defrayed?—In time of peace you also pay double taxes, to <HI>defray the expences of Peace.</HI> Ye senseless ideots! These, and such like things, <HI>constitute</HI> the chief <HI>glory</HI> of the <HI>State!!</HI></P>
<P>Look again into the Law; the scene still brightens before you! <HI>Englishmen!</HI> you have the <HI>cheapest merket for Justice</HI> in the whole universe! how happily adjusted are the laws between <HI>debtor</HI> and <HI>creditor!</HI> no unnecessary delay attends the action; no anxiety of mind between the contending parties; no <HI>neglect</HI> of business; no <HI>extrava∣gant</HI> expences;—O! what a glorious purchase of <HI>parch∣ment</HI> and <HI>stamps</HI> do you make here! with what com∣posure do you look forward from term to term! in the hands of Mercy and Justice, what can you fear! noth∣ing in the final decision of the court, to ruffle your spi∣rits, or brake the repose of your family! like fat oysters ye are gently opened and separated, that the <HI>happy stuff,</HI> which lies between, may be applied to enrich the <HI>glorious Constitution.</HI></P>
<P>And now take a view of the Church! and see the angelical life of the Holy Priesthood; here is Paradise Regained!—by divine permission, here is heaven it∣self let down upon earth! an assemblage of all the
<PB N="ix" REF="029629_0007_0FE20BF82413FE10"/><HI>races</HI> and <HI>virtues</HI> which dignify and adorn human na∣ture —how equally proportioned is the hire to the la∣bourer! No lazy Bishops, no fine cure places, no dissipa∣ted Priests, no <HI>starving Curates</HI>—O no, no!—Justice, temperance, truth, and brotherly love, animate and pervades the whole; here is a <HI>scourge</HI> for the wickedness of men in high life, and a consolation for the miseries of the poor—here is religion taught by the <HI>best masters</HI> with able assistants, on the most <HI>reasonable terms!</HI> a lit∣tle entrance money only is required; marrying, christ∣ening, confirming, visiting, and burying, almost for an old song; and tythes exactly according to circum∣stances! Thrice <HI>happy,</HI> and <HI>glorious Constitution!!!</HI> we are lost in the contemplation of thy <HI>manifold</HI> blessings.</P>
<P>Hear then, ye "SWINISH MULTITUDE!" the Statesmen at Whitehall, the Judges on the Bench, all the Parish Officers in the nation, their dependants and expectants, proclaim aloud that ye are HAPPY! and who so competent to judge of your <HI>happiness?</HI> Beware of that fatal error of judging for yourselves. What! think for yourselves! O let me intreat, nay let me insist up∣on it, that you never think of <HI>thinking for yourselves;</HI> for the more you <HI>think,</HI> the more you will differ from these <HI>wise</HI> and <HI>happy</HI> men in your way of thinking: Think also, how many mild, happy and glorious Constitutions have been ruined by men thinking <HI>for themselves!</HI> Let your betters, therefore think for you; because it stands to reason, they must think <HI>best;</HI> and if the phantom should again seize your brain; and tempt you to con∣ceive
<PB N="x" REF="029629_0008_0FE20BFE94EA7E00"/>you are not <HI>happy,</HI> you must petition the <HI>happy Constitution</HI> to furnish you with some <HI>pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nt engines, pul∣lies</HI> and <HI>screws,</HI> whereby you may at any time wind up your imagination to their pitch, dance to their music, and be as happy as themselves.</P>
<P><HI>Crede quod habes, et habet,</HI> said Erasmus; with this word of advice I take my leave; without shattering you, courting your patronage, or saying a single word about the merit of the Songs.</P>

<LG>
<L>YE vile SWINISH herd, in the sty of taxation,</L>
<L>What would ye be after—disturbing the nation?</L>
<L>Give over your grunting—be off—to your sty!</L>

<L>Do you know what a king is? By <HI>Patrick</HI> I'll tell ye;</L>
<L>He has power in his pocket to buy you and sell you;</L>
<L>To make you his soldiers, or keep you at work;</L>
<L>To hang you, and cure you, for ham or salt pork!</L>
<L>Get ye down!</L>

<LG>
<L>Do you think that a KING is no more than a man?</L>
<L>Ye brutish, ye swinish, irrational clan!</L>
<L>I swear by his office, his right is divine,</L>
<L>To slog you, and feed you, and treat you like swine!</L>
<L>Get ye down!</L>

<L>To be sure, I have said—but I spoke it abrupt—</L>

<P><Q>SURELY (says he, speaking of the <HI>last</HI> Queen of France) never LIGHTED ON THIS ORB, which she hardly seemed to TOUCH, a more delightful VISION! I saw her JUST ABOVE THE HORISON, decorating and chearing the elevated sphere she just began to move in—glittering like the MORN∣ING STAR! full of life and splendor, and joy. I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from their scabbards to avenge <HI>(What?)</HI> even a LOOK that threatened her with an insult!!!—But the Age of Chivalry is gone!—The GLORY of Europe is extinguished forever!!!</Q>—<BIBL>BURKE on the French Revolution, page 112.</BIBL></P>

SURELY, Reader, if you possess one grain of common sense, you will say that either this passage is not quoted from BURKE'S celebrated Defence of Roy∣alty, or that the author took leave of his senses when he wrote it.—I have looked into his book three times, that I might not mistake, and I am willing to make affidavit before our sovereign lord the king, that you may find it in page 112.</P>

<L>He thought we were asleep,</L>

<L>He leaves the dissipated crew,</L>

<L>The law he next surveys, and sees</L>

<L>Where Freedom the light of her countenance gives,</L>

<L>You know, my dear cr'ature, your brother's your FOE,</L>
<L>And his throat you must cut, if your king tells you so,</L>

<HEAD>THE ORIGIN OF KINGS. <HI>A FRAGMENT.</HI></HEAD>
<L>—WHEN Time was young,</L>
<L>And Earth was clad in Nature's rudest garb,</L>
<L>Dark tangled forests, desarts vast and drear,</L>
<L>Wild heaths, and reedy lakes, and rushy fens;</L>
<L>When fresh and vig'rous from th' Eternal hand,</L>
<L>Man trode the rough domain; himself as rough;</L>
<L>The bus'ness of bis life to propagate,</L>
<L>To draw nutrition, and to keep at bay</L>
<L>Instinct's ferocious swarms; then the wide world</L>
<L>Was but a huge estate, Heav'n the prime Lord,</L>
<L>And all mankind his equal tenantry.</L>
<L>No power was known, save that which Nature owns—</L>
<L>Paternal sway—Clad in the spoils of brutes,</L>
<L>And unrestrain'd as is the mountain's blast,</L>
<L>Dauntless and firm the sturdy savage roam'd,</L>
<L>His family a state, himself a chief.</L>
<L>Water, wild fruits and animal repasts,</L>
<L><PB N="85" REF="029629_0083_0FE20CEB2489F930"/>
Compos'd his worldly good; with these in view,</L>
<L>On the rough margin of some stream or lake,</L>
<L>Begirt with matted brakes and forests tall,</L>
<L>He rear'd, with unskill'd hand, his wattled shed.</L>
<L>Around him nimble as the bounding roe,</L>
<L>His naked offspring play'd. Time brought desires,</L>
<L>And from desires, which to repress, was sin,</L>
<L>Full many a progeny soon frolick'd round—</L>
<L>Affection filial, fondness for the seat</L>
<L>Of all their youthful gambols, and the dread</L>
<L>Of climes less bounteous, fix'd him to the soil.</L>
<L>The patriot fire now glimmer'd; smaller tribes,</L>
<L>Lur'd by the hopes of plenty, or induc'd</L>
<L>By love of social intercourse, pour'd in;</L>
<L>And by their ardent youth were soon made one.</L>
<L>Thus congregated man, and thus wild wastes,</L>
<L>The haunts of shaggy tribes, were sprinkled o'er</L>
<L>With many a human dwelling. Settled now,</L>
<L>Man's wond'rous faculties began to shoot.</L>
<L>For heav'n who plac'd him midst this warring scene,</L>
<L>Unarm'd and void of cov'ring, gave him pow'rs</L>
<L>Superior far to all that brutes possess;</L>
<L>Gave him by his own efforts to improve:</L>
<L>Hence came the jav'lin, and the furry garb,</L>
<L>And all that polish'd regions now enjoy.</L>
<L>Each sire was still the sov'reign of his shed,</L>
<L>And all internal bick'rings might compose.</L>
<L>But when contention 'mongst these very sires,</L>
<L>Uncheck'd by pow'r superior, rear'd his head,</L>
<L>All then was wild confusion. Hence 'twas found,</L>
<L><PB N="86" REF="029629_0084_0FE20CF0726D9F48"/>
That man i'th' social state lack'd more controul,</L>
<L>Than could from patriarchal rule proceed.</L>
<L>But who might say what this controul should be?</L>
<L>At this grand, yet simple point t' adjust,</L>

<L>And with bold action metaphoric speech,</L>

<L>'Twas genuine Nature all. A few strong laws</L>
<L>The infant senate fabricated soon,</L>
<L>Which shew'd the sires, all emulous of good;</L>
<L>For each strong law, however rude, was fram'd</L>
<L>As laws should e'er be fram'd, like yon bright orb</L>
<L>To shed no PARTIAL influence. All were bound—</L>
<L>All by the ties which they themselves had made,</L>
<L>Were bound alike, and therefore all enjoy'd</L>
<L>Man's dearest, noblest blessing—LIBERTY.—</L>
<L>As ev'ry family its chief possess'd,</L>
<L>And as their various families might now</L>
<L>Be deem'd but one; at the same time, perchance,</L>
<L>To be their common Father, Guardian, Friend,</L>
<L>And to enforce their EQUAL laws, some sire,</L>
<L>For wisdom and manly prowess fam'd,</L>
<L>Was rais'd by free election 'bove the rest,</L>
<L>And cloth'd, whilst those who rais'd him should think mete,</L>
<L>With the fair robe of delegated power.</L>
<L>Such was the Origin of Kings. At first</L>

<L>Will bribe 'em, and feed 'em, to <HI>fight</HI> for <HI>their own.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Devil burn 'em, to say such a Heathenish thing</L>
<L>Of a wise, decent, generous, church-going King!</L>
<L>To fill foreign mouths, will he pinch from the Poor's?</L>
<L>And tax their <HI>last scrap</HI> for <HI>Croats and Pandours?</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh John! these connections with Goths and with Huns,</L>
<L>Was ever the curse of your Isle, and her sons!</L>
<L>If you knew when you're well, you'd stand fast on your ground,</L>
<L>And, at any one end on't, you'd <HI>face</HI> the world round.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But to set out a tilting, and shake your weak lance</L>
<L>Against millions of men, arm'd for <HI>freedom</HI> in France,</L>
<L>Was a twist in your head, Master Bull, d'ye see—</L>
<L>Mighty strange <HI>in your Nation, that made it self free.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But your foes, my dear John, say your brains are of lead,</L>
<L>That the fog of your Island's ne'er out of your head;</L>
<L>That alike you misjudge of good measures or bad,</L>
<L>And are <HI>stupidly drowsy</HI>—or <HI>wilfully mad!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By my soul, John, I've study'd your nature awhile;</L>
<L>And I think, when they say so, they don't miss a mile:</L>
<L>The world's wide, to be sure; but as <HI>intellects</HI> go,</L>
<L>You'r as <HI>clumsy and bother'd a beast</HI> as I know.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="93" REF="029629_0091_0FE20D05033AEB68"/>
<L>Don't you think it's a pretty, political touch—</L>
<L>To keep shooting your gold in the <HI>dams of the Dutch?</HI></L>
<L>Sending troops to be <HI>swamp'd,</HI> where they can't <HI>draw their</HI> breath;</L>
<L>And buying a load of fresh taxes with death?</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then your <HI>friends,</HI> who've been sucking the <HI>sap of your skull,</HI></L>
<L>Now choose to be fed on your <HI>fat</HI> Master Bull!</L>
<L>Oh! your wisker mouth Prussia's a <HI>Hell of a Bite—</HI></L>
<L>And your Eagle of Austria's a <HI>damnable Kite!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Like the Jay in the Fable, all pluck you, good John:</L>
<L>But the whole mean to <HI>shew you their tails,</HI> when they've done.</L>
<L>Oh! 'twill please you to see, when they <HI>all have a feather,</HI></L>
<L>How they'll <HI>push forth their wings</HI> and <HI>go off all together.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Then comes the account, John: and faith, to be frank,</L>
<L>The cost is unbounded; the credit—a blank!</L>
<L>It's a right <HI>Flemish</HI> bargain, where all you can claim,</L>
<L>Is a plentiful balance of—<HI>taxes and shame.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But, when substance is gone, John, one blessing remains—</L>
<L>We prize little things, and we count little gains:</L>
<L>Thus, tho' broke down by burthens, to <HI>lighten</HI> mishap,</L>
<L>You've a <HI>feather or two, John, to stick in your cap.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yes; Laurels you have, John, to <HI>tickle your ear—</HI></L>
<L>For you've conquer'd a Corsican mountain, I hear;</L>
<L>And the Carribbe Laurels—Oh fortunate lot!</L>
<L>You've reap'd, and a fine <HI>yellow</HI> harvest you've got.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="94" REF="029629_0092_0FE20D0B3232A988"/>
<L>Then, a <HI>wond'rous magnanimous</HI> boast, too, is yours:</L>
<L>With no reason on earth, to bring War to your doors,</L>
<L>You, regardless of <HI>policy, safety,</HI> or <HI>pelf,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Have paid all the world's damages,</HI> and <HI>beggar'd yourself.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Faith, your tax-burthen'd sons, John, will <HI>bless the dark hour,</HI></L>
<L>When the <HI>war-whoop of Kings,</HI> and the <HI>squeakings of Pow'r,</HI></L>
<L>Made a nation of <HI>Freemen</HI> the clamor applaud—</L>
<L><HI>And load their own necks, to chain monsters abroad.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Oh! to what will it come, John—this <HI>guilty affair?</HI></L>
<L>For all acts of your state are, <HI>now, acts of despair!</HI></L>
<L>Like Spendthrifts undone, ever <HI>frantic</HI> they seem;</L>
<L><HI>And widen that ruin they cannot redeem!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Big curses by day, ay, and bigger by night,</L>
<L>On the Jenky-nurs'd Jackall that brought on this plight!</L>
<L>Who has <HI>stalk'd on Court stills</HI> to that ruinous brink,</L>
<L>Where it's hopeless to move—and more hopeless to think.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L><HI>A while</HI> your brave <HI>tars,</HI> the great <HI>prop of your State,</HI></L>
<L>Have, by glory and conquest, John, put <HI>off</HI> your fate;</L>
<L>But, if e'er on <HI>French decks,</HI> shouts of <HI>victory roar,</HI></L>
<L><HI>The Crown's a Red Night-cap—and Britain's no more!</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Troth, the <HI>Cur</HI> was well warn'd of War's <HI>desperate</HI> sin,</L>
<L>Then, with head-long presumption, he <HI>hurry'd</HI> you in.</L>
<L>The voice of sound wisdom cry'd loud on the curse:</L>
<L>But wisdom was <HI>wind,</HI> to the <HI>voice of the nurse!</HI></L>

<L>But the slave will soon see on what <HI>sand he was built;</HI></L>
<L>For the <HI>virtues of Freemen,</HI> NOW wake on his guilt;</L>
<L><HI>They at length see the storm,</HI> and with horror refuse</L>
<L>To <HI>cut up the Country</HI>—for <HI>Cabinet views.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Too long, John, I've told you, the helm would break down,</L>
<L>With this <HI>foul-going Pilot,</HI> that <HI>steers for the Crown.</HI></L>
<L>But I've done; for, <HI>now</HI> ruin hangs over the elf:</L>
<L><HI>So, good luck to your King—and long life to yourself!</HI></L>
