<EPIGRAPH>
<BIBL>Epistle to the GALATIANS, Chap. iv. Ver. 18.</BIBL>
<Q>It is good to be zealously affected al∣ways in a good Thing.—</Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HERE is no Duty more needful to be strenuously and universally inculcated, than what any Text concisely, but em∣phatically, recommends; nor any Op∣portunity, wherein I may hope to do it with more Advantage, than what now solemnly offers itself.—</P>
<P>In discoursing on these memorable Words, I shall, <HI>First,</HI> explain the true Purport of them; showing under what Limitations the glorious Virtue, here en∣join'd, is to be understood; and at the same Time proving that the Practice of it, as it springs from laudable Principles, and is manag'd by a right Con∣duct, is truly a religious, as well as civil Duty.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I shall demonstrate from some Instances, of <HI>Jewish</HI> History chiefly, that in Proportion as this Queen of Virtues was more or less asserted, cherish'd, and epidemically diffus'd, the Rise and Progress, or the Fall and Declension, of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> State, and indeed
<PB N="10" REF="007574_0007_102D7BDF1914BEF0"/>of the most potent Empires and Common-Wealths, and consequently of Arts and Sciences, may be trac'd and ascertain'd.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I shall, as cogently as I can, enfore the Doctrine of this divine Precept, with a particular Appli∣cation to my respectable Auditors, not only to each In∣dividual, interested as a Member of the Society in the Welfare and Preservation of his Country; but, with all Humility and Deference, to the <HI>Three Branches</HI> of it's Legislature; most of whom, I was, at a short Warn∣ing, inform'd, wou'd previously convene at this sacred Place, to implore the Blessing of Almighty GOD on their Consultations, for taking the most speedy, effec∣tual, and salutary Measures to secure the public Peace, Honour, and Emolument, in this critical Juncture: And this I shall dutifully and conscientiously endea∣vour to perform, by urging to you some of the princi∣pal Motives, that ought to influence a Christian, in∣stigate a Commonwealthsman, and animate a true <HI>Briton.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> I am to set forth the true Purport of the Words of my Text; showing what the glorious Vir∣tue is, and under what Circumscriptions it is here en∣join'd; and proving, as it springs from laudable Prin∣ciples, and is manag'd by a well-temper'd Conduct, that the Practice of it is truly a religious, as well as civil Duty.</P>
<P><HI>It is good to be zealously affected always in a good Thing.</HI>—Which is as much as to say in Paraphrase, —It is an indispensable Duty, universally, and, in
<PB N="11" REF="007574_0008_102D7BE0E7041D08"/>course, obligatory on Christian Converts under the Light of the Gospel, as it was before on all Nations under the mere moral Guidance of Nature, (since it is absurd and impious to maintain, that the Laws of the Former cou'd ever supersede or contradict the genuine Dictates of the Latter, which they were intended to strengthen, and give a higher Sanction to) on all, without Exception, obligatory; and that too, at all Times,—<Q>To be cordially affected with a good Thing, in Proportion to the Object exciting this Affection, or the Exigence requiring it.</Q>—Or, in other Words,—<Q>To apply the Faculties of our Minds, and the Powers of our Bodies, with the prudential Influence of our respective Stations and Fortunes, for the Advancement of a good Cause, for obtaining, by honest Means, honest Ends, whether they regard a local and less general Welfare in an inferior De∣gree, or the Utility of the whole Community in the <HI>highest.</HI></Q></P>
<P>So, you see, Zeal, in general, is the grand Virtue here recommended by the eminent Apostle, not only to the Churches of <HI>Galatia,</HI> to whom he particularly addresses this Epistle, but to all Disciples of CHRIST, wheresoever disperst, to whom he design'd his sacred Writings shou'd be duly and impartially communica∣ted, in order to be transcrib'd, and publicly read in their Assemblies of Worship, for the Benefit of all Ranks of People. Nor did the mighty <HI>Saint Paul</HI> think it sufficient barely to act as the Scribe of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> but he most remarkably distinguish'd himself in being on all proper Occasions the practical and fore∣most
<PB N="12" REF="007574_0009_102D7BE2AC86BA38"/>Example of the noble Precept he delivers. No Difficulties discourag'd; no Dangers deterr'd; no pri∣vate Avocations diverted him (as with a generous Conscionsness, but modest Declaration, he informs us), from the arduous Work of his Ministry; from serving the Cause of his GOD, his Countrymen, and Mankind. Hence it is, that he so strenuously insists on the full Exertion of all the adequate Ardour, which a good Cause calls for in Execution: All the Heroism, which Virtue glowingly suggests, or Christianity inspires. As the Practice of his Master's Dispensation was very pro∣perly stil'd a Warfare; what forceful Images, what bold Figures, does he borrow from the military Art and <HI>Roman</HI> Discipline, to train up his Pupils by the holy Exercise for glorious Exploits in the Combats they were destin'd to; for the various Lists they were to wrestle in; <Q>for fighting against Principalities and Powers; and the Rulers of the Darkness of this World; against spiritual Wickedness in high Places? They are commanded to put on the whole Armour of GOD: To gird their Loins with Truth: To assume the Breast-plate of Righteousness: To stand firm in the Post of Honour: To invest their Heads with the Helmet of Salvation: To wield the Sword of the Spirit: And, above all, to defend themselves with the Shield of Faith, whereby they might quench, or repel, all the fiery Darts of the Wick∣ed.</Q>—</P>
<P>Again, in being obliged to propose himself, as a Pattern to them of Patience and Fortitude, while he industriously guards against Imputations of Vanity,
<PB N="13" REF="007574_0010_102D7BE497D9C620"/>with what persuasive, what resistless Eloquence, does this consummate Orator (scarce less humanly learned, than divinely inspir'd) insinuate himself into the Hearts of his Readers, and captivate their Passions, while he convinces their Understandings? Such was this Instru∣ment of Providence for accomplishing the most impor∣tant Enterprizes; this <HI>Elect of GOD:</HI>—Not ar∣bitrarily so, but becoming his <HI>chosen Vessel</HI> from the previous Disposition of a good Heart to engage in a good Cause at all Adventures: And that he vitally and in∣timately felt, what he wou'd proselyte others to, we cannot doubt, when he thus expresses himself to his Countrymen, proverbially proud of the Origin of their Nation! "Are you <HI>Hebrews?</HI> So am I!—(And, by anticipating the Application of the subsequent Part of this Sermon, let me too somewhat abruptly say,—Are you <HI>Englishmen?</HI> Are you, my Hearers, <HI>Britons?</HI>—You are: All are: So am I!— And therefore, independent of my sacred Function, I have a natural Claim to your Attention.) But, to proceed, <Q>Are you <HI>Israelites,</HI> or of the Seed of <HI>Abra∣bam?</HI> So am I! In Labours more abundant: In Stripes above Measure: In Prisons frequent: In Deaths oft: Of the <HI>Jews</HI> five Times receiv'd I forty Stripes, save one: Thrice was I beaten with Rods: Once was I ston'd: Thrice I suffer'd Shipwreck: A Night and a Day have I been in the Deep: In Journeying often: In Perils of Water: In Perils of Robbers: In Perils of mine own Countrymen: In Perils by the Heathen: In Perils in the City: In Perils in the Wilderness: In Perils in the Sea: In Perils among false Brethren: In Weariness and
<PB N="14" REF="007574_0011_102D7BE6A8BAAA90"/>Painfulness: In Watchings often: In Hunger and Thirst: In Fastings often: In Cold and Nakedness: And (besides those numberless Things, that are without) that, which cometh upon me daily, the Care of all the Churches.</Q></P>
<P>Thus equally from the Doctrine and Example of Saint <HI>Paul</HI> (without insisting on many other Scriptural Instances, no less pertinent) we may be sufficiently assur'd, that Zeal, rightly understood and well-regula∣ted, is truly a Christian and Social Virtue; not only speculatively to be assented to by Reason, but incum∣bent on the Votaries of CHRIST, to be carry'd into Act with Alacrity and Assiduity, as best may serve the meritorious Purposes, which are only attainable by its Assistance.—The Phrase indeed, <HI>to be zealously af∣fected,</HI> however obvious to all candid and ordinary Understandings, is often liable to be abus'd, and gross∣ly misapply'd by rash and precipitate Men. It means no more than an intense Bent of Mind and vigorous Attachment to whatever we are engag'd in, or con∣cern'd about; and, like all other Passions, such as Love, Anger, and the like, may be laudable or culpa∣ble; equally productive of the noblest Ends, or most ruinous Consequences, according as it is kept within due Bounds, or permitted to swell to Excess; and its intrinsic Goodness or Badness must be determin'd by its Motive, Object, and Degree. Thus the Violence of this very <HI>Saint Paul</HI> for persecuting the Church of CHRIST, before his Conversion, is call'd Zeal: The same Word which he uses, for the Virtue he so highly commends in my Text; where he takes Care (as the
<PB N="15" REF="007574_0012_102D7BE876DE91E0"/>Mark and Criterion of Distinction) to direct the Regu∣lation of our Zeal, by confining it to be employ'd always in a good Thing; for then only itself can be always good. It nearly behoves us then, that our Zeal be occupy'd rightly; otherwise it degenerates into wild Folly, Madness and Sin; and the more we are transported by it, the more Guilt we shall contract. To be zealous for the Honour of GOD, for the In∣terest and Propagation of our holy Religion; for the Benefit of our Species, or the Prosperity of our Country, is no Doubt, of all other Things, most praise-worthy; though even in these Cases our Zeal may be misguided and sadly perverted, and so lose all its Value and Re∣ward.—But, on the other Hand, Luke-warmness and Indifference therein, is certainly most base and unmanly in the Sense of Nature, and, from various Authorities in the Word of GOD, most degrading and sinful. <Q>Thou shalt love the Lord, thy GOD, with thine Heart, with all thy Mind, with all thy Soul, and with all thy Strength: And thy Neighbour (in which general Word our Country is mainly included) as thy self,</Q> is declar'd by our Saviour to be the Essence and Sum of Religion, and to comprehend the whole of the Law and the Prophets.—That is,—All divine, social, and moral Duties, perfective of our Na∣tures, and preparative to our Happiness. And here it is remarkable, how emphatically, and with what repe∣titious Enforcements our Lord urges a well-grounded Zeal; excluding from it, lest his Meaning should be convey'd in too feeble a manner, all Coldness, Listless∣ness and vile Mediocrity. Indeed in all his Actions, in all his private Documents, and public Sermons, in
<PB N="16" REF="007574_0013_102D7BEA978F24A8"/>his Life, and in his Death, he displays, with an Ener∣gy becoming the Captain of our Salvation, his Appro∣bation, beyond all others, of this Virtue, soaring to all the warrantable and rational Degrees, to which it may be exalted. Nay, he exhibits it as the Test and Characteristic of his faithful Militants, his noble Army of veteran Martyrs and Confessors; and, we know, a Diffusion of this generous Principle among them, ren∣der'd them more than Conquerers in the midst of Flames; till, triumphant over ten bloody Persecutions of merciless Tyrants, they subdu'd all the Rage and Fury of Fiends and Men; of spiritual and incarnate Demons, associated against them.</P>
<P>Again, says our Redeemer, deterring us from an Abatement of true Zeal: <Q>He, that loves Father or Mother, Brother or Sister, Wife or Children, more than me, is not worthy to be my Disciple:</Q> And we may easily conceive, by attending to the true Im∣port of these Words, that he means not hereby to de∣stroy the Ties of these sacred Relationships, or in the least to relax, or weaken them, when he elsewhere takes all Occasions tenderly to strengthen them, both as natural and positive Duties; but that, when any Concernments of an inferior Kind happen to come in Competition with those of a superior Importance, so as that an absolute Adherence to the former cannot be maintain'd, without Renouncing the latter, then the higher Obligation must take Place, and indispensably claims our Preserence. Thus a well-regulated Zeal, without more ado, will dictate to us, that the Glory of our universal Father, <HI>who is in Heaven,</HI> must be
<PB N="17" REF="007574_0014_102D7BECCB03D300"/>nearer our Hearts, than our Affections to our earthly Parents, who are but his Instruments, and secondary Agents for our Being. Thus all, who enjoy the va∣rious Benefits and Protection of the Laws of a Society are strictly and fundamentally bound to a primary Re∣gard for its Health and Safety beyond lesser Considera∣tions, personal Views, smaller Alliances, and the like: And if we wou'd deserve for our Zeal to be stil'd, like <HI>David,</HI> Men after GOD's own Heart, our Love to the Community must surmount these, even as much as the Whole is greater than a small Quantity of its Parts, or a Species of People more numerous than a few of its Individuals.</P>
<P>Thus then the Flame of our Incense is never pure and acceptable, or sends forth a sweet Savour, but when it burns brightly, and unadulterated with smouldering Smoke; which a faint Heat, or Lukewarmness, chiefly Occasions. Its Fewel too must be lasting and perma∣nent; not apt to blaze out too fiercely, and after a transient Violence expire, <HI>like Thorns under a Pot,</HI> as the Psalmist expresses it. In short, we must use the most prudential Caution to steer in the golden Medium between the Extremes of intemperate Fury, in a good Cause, and an almost creeping, grovelling, and sordid Insensibility, on the other. While a Bigot in every light is odious; a meer moderate Lover of his Country (especially when Danger threatens it ever so remotely, and much more when it nearly approaches), is a most detestable and ridiculous Monster. If we wou'd escape the Imputation of the former, we shou'd meditate on the Words of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in his Epistle to the <HI>Romans:
<PB N="18" REF="007574_0015_102D7BEE9AFF31A0"/>I hear them Record, that they have a Zeal for GOD, but not according to Knowlege.</HI> Or if we wou'd not be stigmatiz'd for being as despicable as the latter, let us animadvert on what the Angel in the Revelations commands <HI>St. John</HI> to write to the Churches of <HI>Laodi∣cea.—I know thy Works, that thou art neither cold, nor hot: I wou'd that thou wert either cold, or hot: So then because thou art lakewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>We live, alas! in an Age, when true public Spirit (by which I understand the most elevated Species of the Zeal here prov'd a Christian Duty), is very languid and defective; where too often, a Spirit of Faction, the very Reverse of it, usurps its Place, and arrogates with loud and awkward Insolence its sacred Form; but the specious Mask may be easily stripp'd off, and its native Deformity detected by a little more than ordinary In∣spection into its blustering Pretences and Ends of Ac∣tion; which will be all found in a little Time to spring from, or center in, some low, mercenary, and contract∣ed View. We too frequently observe it invidiously ob∣structing the Wheels of Government, and embroiling a State, where it is not admitted to an immediate Parti∣cipation of Power: Industriously watchful to detect and aggravate little Errors in an Administration, for the Gratification of private Spleen and Revenge; employ∣ing its clamourous Rhetoric to render itself of Conse∣quence; and pertinaciously maintaining its Importance, by instilling Jealousies, somenting Discontents, and at∣tracting popular Applause from the giddy <HI>Vulgar,</HI> great and small, with strong Passions and weak Brains. But
<PB N="19" REF="007574_0016_102D7BF06A37ADA0"/>all this argues a Disingenuity, and Infirmity of Mind, and is no more to be compar'd to public Spirit, than the unnatural Tumours in a dropsical Person, to the just Proportions of a sound and healthful Body.</P>
<P>In fine, while I really think there is more Danger to be apprehended from a shameful Deficiency in this all-animating Principle, than from its Excels and Re∣dundancy, I won'd have every true Patriot fix its pro∣per Boundaries in Reason and Conscience, and distin∣guish the sierce, unbridled, bloody, and enthusiastical Zeal of a thorough-pac'd Republican and desperate Re∣gicide; of an <HI>Ireton</HI> and a <HI>Bradshaw,</HI> from the inflexi∣bly honest, wise, and disciplin'd Ardour of a <HI>Hamden;</HI> equally employing his Tongue in the Senate, and his Sword in the Field, in Defence of his Country's unalien∣able Rights: Of Liberty invaded:—Social Liberty! Mankind's original and universal Charter from Hea∣ven!—<HI>Hamden,</HI>—I say; almost singly at first stem∣ming the Torrent of Royal Incroachments and Ministe∣rial Oppression; who, living, stood the Bulwark of the State; and, dying, fell the Emulation of Heroes! An Example, alone sufficient to rouse undegenerated <HI>Britons</HI> in any Time of public Distress (whether foreign or civil) into somewhat <HI>more</HI> than ancient <HI>Romans;</HI> as much <HI>more,</HI> as our Constitution in State is preferable in all Respects to their boasted Republic; and our Pro∣testant Christianity to the (almost-similar) Idolatry of old, or modern <HI>Rome!</HI></P>
<P>Though much remains to be still spoken to on this Head, yet left an intelligent Audience might think
<PB N="20" REF="007574_0017_102D7BF2E5650368"/>a farther Enlargement too great an Invasion of their Time, I shall proceed to the next:</P>
<P>And show, in the <HI>second Place,</HI> from some glaring Instances of ancient <HI>Jewish</HI> History chiefly, that in Proportion, as this Sovereign of social Virtues, public Spirit, or in other Words, the Love of our Country, was more or less asserted, cherish'd, and epidemically diffus'd, the Rise and Progress, or the Fall and Declen∣sion of the <HI>Hebrew</HI> State, and indeed of the most po∣tent Commonwealths and Empires, <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman,</HI> and consequently of Arts and Sciences, may be trac'd and ascertain'd.</P>
<P>After the Expulsion of the impious and idolatrous Nations, and the Settlement of the <HI>Jews</HI> in the pro∣mis'd Land, purchas'd by a memorable Series of glorious Victories under their mighty Leader <HI>Joshua;</HI> how soon did they sink into torpid Indolence, and were lull'd into a base Security and false Confidence, by the bewitching Charms of the <HI>Syrens,</HI> Peace and Plenty; supporting themselves rather by the Terror of their Name, than by any intrinsic Principle of national Stength, or ex∣ternal Preparation? How soon did they forget the last, the dying, Instructions of their great Lawgiver under GOD, <HI>Moses,</HI> manfully to defend the Country, which they ow'd to the Indulgence of Providence; that goodly Country, <HI>flowing with Milk and Honey;</HI> yet, take Notice, inferior in Situation and Fertility, (and, all Things consider'd, in Climate too), to that, which we, of this delightful Province, from the same all bountiful Hand, now possess? How were they prepar'd to be
<PB N="21" REF="007574_0018_102D7BF4D3731870"/>sent back to their <HI>Egyptian</HI> Taskmasters; to servile Drudgery; to be <HI>Hewers of Wood, and Drawers of Water,</HI> to groan out their beastial Lives under the Ty∣ranny of a <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> (the true Antitype of the <HI>most Christian</HI> King, the most despotical, persecuting <HI>French Grand Monarch)</HI> to be driven, by their Overseers, like our restive Negro-Slaves, <HI>to make Brick without Straw,</HI> to erect a Pyramid, or a <HI>Versailles,</HI> an eter∣nal Monument of their own Subjection, and their Ty∣rant's Vain-Glory?—How quickly did their brutal Appetites yearn after their precarious Meals of sodden Fleshpots; for the edible Gods of their Masters; and the Gods of their own Bellies; even Lentils, Leeks and Onions; which despicably and ingratefully they murmur'd for, in Preference to Manna or Quails; to Liberty and <HI>the Bread of Heaven!</HI> How soon by de∣viating from the Maxims, on which only their condi∣tional Establishment was to be confirm'd, did they fall under the galling and alternate Yoke of every neigh∣bouring Heathen Nation, adopting the Manners, and in Part the Religion of their corrupted and corrupting Conquerors; as we read in the <HI>Book of Judges;</HI> all the Chapters of which are only brief Annals of their Infatuation and Subjection; or of their Repentance and miraculous Deliverance under Heaven-rais'd Gene∣rals, or occasionally-selected Chieftains, according to their several Emergencies and Distresses.—Every now and then, such a Leader was indeed requisite! <HI>Such,</HI> as the Inhabitants of this Province have Reason to felicitate themselves upon, in his gracious Majesty's paternal Choice, or Approbation of our Governor, to conduct, either singly, or in Conjunction with other
<PB N="22" REF="007574_0019_102D7BF6A1678F38"/>Commanders, our <HI>own,</HI> and the Forces of the conti∣guous Colonies, in Association, on a concerted Expedi∣tion in our present Exigency, against the enterprising Foes of <HI>Europe's, America's,</HI> and the World's Repose; if he be enabled by the present (I hope and believe Patriot) <HI>Assembly</HI> to prosecute the Royal Orders, and his own generous Purpose.—A Gentleman, who (without a vain Compliment in the awful House of GOD) has a real Right to a high Esteem from you, both on Account of his Station and personal Merit; and whom it is the Duty of us all to regard, as not deriving his Preferments from Court-Interest, but as thus distinguish'd for known Loyalty, and military Ex∣perience, which we cannot doubt, but he will now ex∣ert to the utmost, if an ill-tim'd Parsimony does not starve his Cause, and petty Dissentions and Avocations from the grand Concernment, do not interpose to check his Designs, and prevent what his cool Deliberation, and natural Ardour, give us most rational Hopes he will have a main Hand in accomplishing: The principal Merit and Glory of which, will redound to this Province, and more and more recommend its important Interests to the Mother-Nation, so intimately blended with her own; if our Contributions for the common Service be more chearfully given, or more speedily rais'd, than those of our Neighbouring Governments.—</P>
<P>But, again, if we consider the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation under their Kings, (whose Government they perversely preser'd to an Hierarchy under the <HI>King</HI> of Kings) to what can we impute the Train and Vicissitude of Cala∣mities, they by Intervals groan'd under, but to a
<PB N="23" REF="007574_0020_102D7BF8B30E8A98"/>stupid Dormancy, or Decay of this virtuous Zeal in themselves, or their Monarchs? To this dire Source their Prophets unanimously ascribe the Decadence of their State, and the various Judgments of GOD. Whenever any Degree of public Spirit reviv'd, as in the Reigns of <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon</HI> most remarkably, and afterwards in those of <HI>Asa, Hezekiah, Josiah,</HI> and a few Others; how did they attract the divine Favour, to the Confusion of their haughty Enemies? How did the Almighty Arm interpose to save them in the Crisis of complicated Perils? The Almighty Arm, indeed; though not without their own Efforts! (For, they have a wrong Notion of the usual Conduct of Pro∣vidence in sublunary Affairs, who absurdly suppose, that it never uses, or concurs with human Abilities, Dispositions, and Improvements, as Instruments to work it's Purposes!) How prodigiously did useful Arts then flourish: Witness that stupendous Structure, their glori∣ous Temple, so magnificent, so richly ornamented, as wou'd tire Description? How must smiling Commerce have been extended, not only by the numerous Cara∣vans that pass'd by them to <HI>Egypt, Mesopotamia, Assyria, Persia,</HI> and the farthest <HI>Arabia,</HI> but by Means of the much envy'd Ports of <HI>Eloth</HI> and <HI>Eziongeber</HI> on the Red Sea, the great Marts for the Treasures of <HI>Ophir,</HI> and all the rich Commodities of the <HI>East-Indies;</HI> which drew such a Mass of Wealth on this People, while industrious and ancorrupted, (that is, while in∣fluenc'd by public Spirit) that Silver once abounded so as to be accounted but <HI>as the Stones of the Street for it's Plenty;</HI> and Gold, Jewels, Spices, Balsams, Per∣fumes, and invaluable medical Druggs, were transmit∣ted
<PB N="24" REF="007574_0021_102D7BFA45AEB258"/>either by themselves from their principal Sea-Town <HI>Joppa,</HI> or more probably in the Bottomry of <HI>Pheni∣cian</HI> Merchants, through all the Coast of the <HI>Mediter∣ranean,</HI> to the Straits of <HI>Gades,</HI> and the Western Ocean; and we have good Grounds to conjecture that this ori∣ginally open'd, or vastly assisted that immense Trade, by which the <HI>Sidonians</HI> and <HI>Tyrians</HI> were so early en∣rich'd and renown'd; and by which their ever-famous Colony of <HI>Carthage</HI> rose from the meanest Beginnings to the sublimest Pitch of earthly Grandeur, so as to contend for a long Time, and in the most bloody and consumptive Wars, with the <HI>Romans</HI> themselves, their only Rivals for the Empire of the then known World. By listening to the noble Dictates of this vitally active Principle, how did all temporal Blessings, as it were in course, accrue to <HI>Judea;</HI> and how did that minute Spot of the Globe, not half so large as <HI>Maryland,</HI> nor attended, as I hinted, with so many natural Advan∣tages, raise and support such countless Myriads of People, as scarce any History, without the Sanction of Inspiration, cou'd persuade our Belief of? Wonderful as this seems, it is to be accounted for from what I have laid down, as it's Foundation; even, from selfish Attachments to public Interests; (for <HI>self</HI> and <HI>social,</HI> if justly stated, will be found to be but the same Thing in the End, or concentering in one Point) by strictly adhering to their Laws; by loving their civil and ec∣clesiastical Polity; by a firm Union among themselves; by a due Submission to executive Authority; by an honest and vigilant Jealousy of the ambitious Designs of turbulent Neighbours to disturb their Property, or dis∣tress their Trade; by a firm Resolution to repel violent
<PB N="25" REF="007574_0022_102D7BFC19B9FBB8"/>Invasions, and retaliate national Injuries; by manu∣ring and cultivating every Inch of their narrow Terri∣tory, even the most barren Parts, Hills, stoney Val∣lies and sandy Plains, to the last Possibility of Perfecti∣ca; (the apparent Vestigies of which Industry cannot escape a curious Traveller, as Doctor <HI>Maundrel</HI> assures us at this Day, in it's desolate and miserable Condi∣tion) by judicionsly considering the Genius of each particular Soil; and by planting, or sowing therein, whatever was most adapted to it's natural, or reclaim'd State; by encouraging Artificers of all Sorts, and employing their laborious Poor in various Manufac∣tures; and by opening their Hearts and Purses libe∣rally, and by lending their Hands readily and without murmuring, to aid the Community on all Occasi∣ons, to chastise the incursive Heathen, and fight the <HI>Battles of the Lard.</HI></P>
<P>If you shou'd want further Conviction of this; mo∣dern <HI>Holland</HI> will show you, how by pursuing such Measures, (confider'd only in a political Light) their seven diminutive Provinces, not much bigger than seven of our Counties, withstood the whole Monarchy of <HI>Spain,</HI> (then in her Altitude of Power, and assisted with the Wealth of both <HI>Indies</HI> by the Conquest of <HI>Portugal</HI>) dissipating her Land-Forces, and Sea-Ar∣madas, and rendering itself independent of Inquisitions and Tyrants, by incredible Efforts in Trade and Arms at the same Time; till from being the most <HI>Distressed States</HI> (as they call'd themselves in our renown'd Queen <HI>Elisabeth</HI>'s Days) they rose almost instantaneously, like Meteors in Clouds and Storms, to the pompous Deno∣mination
<PB N="26" REF="007574_0023_102D7BFDEC40B470"/>of <HI>High and Mighty;</HI> the Monopolizers of Commerce; the Controullers of Kings; and the Arbiters of <HI>Europe.</HI></P>
<P>A free and mercantile People, who hear all this, must be cover'd with Blushes, or glow with Emulation at the first Recital!</P>
<P>On the other Hand, what caus'd the general Con∣tempt, frequent Captivities, and almost utter Excision of this devoted People, the <HI>Jews,</HI> but being deaf to the reiterated Advice, Threats, and Warnings of their several Prophets: In stupidly dividing the incommu∣nicable Honours and Worship of <HI>Jebovah</HI> with the Calves of <HI>Jeroboam</HI> (who seduc'd ten whole Tribes to a final Revolt at once;) in bowing the Knee alter∣nately to <HI>Baal,</HI> or <HI>Rimnon,</HI> or <HI>Dagon,</HI> or <HI>Ashtoroth,</HI> or <HI>Isis;</HI> and the Rabble of Gods and Goddesses of their Ethnic Neighbours; perhaps as numerous, and as much ador'd, as those we find Sainted, and more than Half-Deisy'd, in the long Muster-Roll of a Popish Calendar; in letting Zeal stagnate by Inaction; or sink into enervate Languer by relaxing the only Sinews of Power and Greatness; by a total Depravation of Manners: And in adopting Schemes diametrically opposite to general Felicity; while they ridiculously imagin'd, that the particular Prosperity of Families, or a narrow∣ly-divided and partial Happiness might continue in a weak and tottering Kingdom.</P>
<P>'Tis true that after the Return of a Remnant of them from their Seventy-Year's Thraldom in <HI>Babylon,</HI> they cannot be justly chargeable with a similar ill Conduct;
<PB N="27" REF="007574_0024_102D7BFFBB0688E0"/>and by smarting so long and so severely for their Apos∣tacy, they can be no more accus'd of the least Prone∣ness to Idolatry; and the brave and memorable Strug∣gles they made under the heroic Race of the <HI>Maccabees</HI> against the <HI>Syro-Macedonian</HI> Tyrants, in Vindication of their Religion and Liberty, are highly commend∣able; and they were accordingly rewarded for it; for, by this Means only their Temple and civil Polity were fully restor'd: They emerg'd for a while, and had some Appearance again of being GOD's select People.— But how soon did they grow wanton, like the stall-fed Ox fit for Slaughter, by battening in Peace, Opulence and Luxury? How soon did they relapse, though not into the same, yet into the other equally destructive extreme of popular Folly? Read but their own <HI>Histo∣rian</HI> well-conversant with those Times, and you will be abundantly confirm'd by what swift Gradations, they pav'd the Way for Extirpation, or total Dispersion when they began to change a true Zeal into a false; when, by admitting Cabals and Faction, into their <HI>Sanhedrin</HI> and Councils, they split into various Sects, and exas∣perated the divided Rabble into fanatical Phrensy by the magical Nicknames (Sounds, without Ideas) of <HI>Pharisee, Sadducee, Herodian,</HI> and the like: For, as to the Meaning and Distinction of the Terms, the Ma∣jority knew no more of them, than many of our Fel∣low-Subjects lately did what <HI>Whig</HI> and <HI>Jory, High-Church</HI> and <HI>Low-Church</HI> signisy'd. Their crafty De∣mogogues and Ringleaders blew the Coals: The in∣flam'd Populace were set together by the Ears with a Jargon of hard words: The <HI>Church</HI> forsooth was in Jeopardy: The Court and Country were alternately in
<PB N="28" REF="007574_0025_102D7C01943E6F20"/>Fault, as the Tide ebb'd or flow'd: All Men were alarm'd, (Few knew why,) at intestine Danger, and laugh'd at foreign; being too eagerly occupy'd in domestic Discords to be sufficiently watchful against formidable and surrounding Enemies, who were too wise to neglect the Opportunity these Dissentions gave them of properly availing themselves thereby.</P>
<P>Thus either by Defect and Omission, or by Abuse and Transgression in Degree of their Zeal or public Spirit, this Heaven-abandon'd People fill'd up the Measare of their Iniquity; and were permitted in their last atrocious Act to crucify their <HI>Messiah.</HI> And thus, in the Nature of Things, and without any absolute Decree of GOD, they were self-doom'd to all the Horrors of civil Butchery, and <HI>Roman</HI> Vengeance, with such terrible, and accumulated Circumstances of Fire, Sword, Pestilence and Famine, as never before afflicted any other Nation, and does too much Violence on Humanity to hear, or relate.—This Good however may be educ'd from their Ill, that a vagabond Residue of them are still preserv'd in all Parts of the World to warn those, they live among, if they wou'd escape their Fate, to avoid those Stages of different Guilt, into which they desperately plung'd themselves at par∣ticular Seasons.</P>
<P>It wou'd require a Volume rather than a Sermon, shou'd I make Extracts for further enforcing the mo∣mentous Truth of this Head from profane Records, since such can be but little necessary, after what I have advanc'd from the sacred Oracles.</P>

Let me therefore only cursorily glance at what the greatest Sages of the two wisest and most renown'd Nations, that ever aw'd and enlighten'd Mankind, have deliver'd as to these Points, <HI>Demosthenes</HI> and <HI>Cicero; Thucidides</HI> and <HI>Tacitus, Aristotle</HI> and <HI>Pliny:</HI> In short, the most famous Orators, Historians, Philo∣sophers and Patriots have evinc'd that the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> ow'd all their Glory in Arts and Arms, not so much to other salutary Institutions of their original Lawgivers, <HI>Lycurgus, Solos,</HI> or <HI>Numa,</HI> as to this one simple Principle of Public Spirit, or a virtuous and well-temper'd Zeal for the Honour and Welfare of their Country, being infus'd into and propagated among, all Ranks of their Subjects, with the utmost Care even from their earliest Insancy.—This (not∣withstanding some temporary Commotions, which ne∣cessarily and frequent, will arise in free States, as the Excrescencies of Liberty, or from the Want of absolute Perfection in human Societies) I say,—Notwithstanding these,—This sole Principle render'd them invincible, conser'd on them the two last of the four great Mo∣narchies foretold by <HI>Daniel,</HI> and immortaliz'd their Name.—Hence the liberal Sciences triumph'd, and the <HI>Muses</HI> exultingly sung: Hence <HI>Apelies</HI> touch'd the Canvas into mimic Life, and Marble seem'd to breathe from the forming Hand of <HI>Praxiteles.</HI> Hence the Works of <HI>Homer,</HI> by exquisitely celebrating the Heroes of Antiquity, in Effect daily created new Ones, while a Transfusion of their Virtues was felt in the Breast of every Reader, capable of being warm'd by his Sentiments and Numbers. Hence a <HI>Curtius</HI> leap'd into the opening Gulph; and the <HI>Decii</HI> devoted them∣selves.—Hence
<PB N="30" REF="007574_0027_102D7C0536D189F0"/>a First <HI>Brutus,</HI> with an Heart as bright and impervious too, as a Rock of polish'd Ada∣mant, asserted the impartial Tribunal of Liberty re∣stor'd; pass'd Sentence of Death on his own Rebel-Sons, and sat with an awful Serenity, till he saw it executed on the two degenerate Youths.—A Godlike Act! Nor is an <HI>English</HI> Christian Clergyman asham'd to give it from the Pulpit that high Epithet, though perform'd by a Heathen.—A Godlike Act; to show amaz'd Posterity, how much the <HI>Consul</HI> shou'd transcend the <HI>Parent;</HI> and the Father of his Country rise above the Father of the Children of his Bowels!—Thus too the second <HI>Brutus,</HI> with a Zeal worthy of the First, bath'd his Dagger in the Heart's Blood of a proud Usurper: A perfidious and overgrown Robber—A Robber, in spite of the false Glare and tinsel Splendor that Adulation deck'd him in; in spite of all those fine Qualities and happy Endowments of Art and Nature, by which he excell'd the Sons of Men; and which but render'd him more eminently culpable, when they were perverted into Instruments of overthrowing the Liberties of his Country, and not made subservient only for it's Preservation and Glory!—Yes,—On this Principle he was justly stabb'd in the midst of his servile, and venal Senate; when no other Resource was left to reinstate the Common-Wealth in it's former Lustre of Independency and Freedom. Hence too,— Lastly,—the venerable <HI>Elders</HI> of a former Senate, but of another Stamp, display'd an Example of truly <HI>Ro∣man</HI> Fortitude, that shou'd engage the Attention of the <HI>Representatives</HI> of a brave <HI>British</HI> People, I mean, that of those <HI>Conscript Fathers;</HI> who, when their
<PB N="31" REF="007574_0028_102D7C078F3E67A0"/>Counsels cou'd no longer assist their bleeding Country, and their Hands were too feeble through the Infirmi∣ties of Age to draw a Sword in its Defence, resolv'd to bury themselves in its Ruins rather than survive it, and with a patient Dignity suffer'd their Throats to be cut by the inhuman <HI>Gauls</HI> (the Predecessors of the present invading, burning, scalping, persecuting, all∣massacreing <HI>French</HI>) who, like a rushing Torrent un∣der <HI>Brennus,</HI> broke into <HI>Italy;</HI> still, as they advanc'd, swelling their Numbers with fresh Accessions of rapaci∣ous Barbarians, in every savage Country, through which they march'd.—</P>
<P>But how did these <HI>sovereign Republics</HI> suffer the Ensigns of Dominion to be snatch'd from their Hands, and all their Laurels to be wither'd? Whence is it, that they declin'd so fast from their Meridian Glory; from their Zenith of boasted Liberty, and set so soon in Obscurity? Why, their own best Authors will unani∣mously acknowlege, it was by starting from the Principle, on which they were founded, and grew into Greatness. 'Twas this pav'd the Way for <HI>Philip</HI>'s dangerous In∣trigues, and <HI>Caesar</HI>'s Ambition. <HI>Athenians, Spartans, Thebans</HI> and <HI>Romans</HI> were gradually prepar'd for Sla∣very, and by abandoning public Spirit, they became an easy Prey to the nearest Invader at Hand, who had Power and Address enough to snatch at, and seramble for it. By warping their Passions from generous Pur∣suits to ignoble Objects, they became ripe for Shackles; such as the rampantly mad <HI>Macedonian Boy,</HI> or a more crasty <HI>Roman Triumvir</HI> thought fit to impose upon them: To whose infamous <HI>Manes</HI> (pardon me, ye

<P>But, 'tis Time; more than Time, to close this Head; and come, as my main Scope, to the Applica∣tion of the Whole:</P>
<P><HI>Is it not now and always, good to be zealonsly affected in a good Thing, or Cause?</HI>—And what Cause can so sensibly affect us, as that of our Country? And to whom shall we have Recourse for Relief, when it is menac'd by hostile Attempts, as at present, but to the <HI>Delegates</HI> of the Community and the <HI>Executive Power,</HI> with whom the Means of raising the Support, and the Methods of carrying it into Action are in∣trusted?</P>
<P>I now address myself with a faithful Boldness, but with duteous Humility and Respect, to each <HI>Brauch</HI> of our Provincial <HI>Legislature;</HI> whom in a private Capa∣city, as Gentlemen, Friends, <HI>Englishmen,</HI> and Fellow-Subjects
<PB N="33" REF="007574_0030_102D7C0B06D786A0"/>under the best of Kings (and <HI>Best</HI> is Greatest in my Opinion) I sincerely love; and whom I cordially honour, as invested with the supreme Power here over a fine and flourishing Country, endear'd to me by the strongest Gratitude, and every warm, and tender Mo∣tive, that can flow from the conscious Heart of Man.</P>
<P>An important Cause indeed renders the convening of the <HI>new Assembly,</HI> even at this rigorous Season of the Year necessary; and its first Session is open'd by a Speech, worthy of his <HI>Excellency</HI> (whom we are here to consider as the immediate Substitute of the <HI>Throne)</HI> for a legal and competent Supply from them adequate to the urgent Occasion, and the Abilities of their Con∣stituents; in Order that he may immediately fulfil the expected Purposes (as I said) of the late Honour∣able Commission from his Majesty; and uniting our proportion'd <HI>Quota</HI> of brave Volunteers with those of other Colonies, propitiously begin his March to repel Force by Force; to punish a flagrant Infringement of the Law of Nations; to secure the exterior Settle∣ments, as a firm Barrier behind us; and to vindicate the just and ample Claims of the <HI>British</HI> Empire; now, on all Parts, Northward and Westward in our Continent, as well as in our Southern Islands, nay, in <HI>Africa,</HI> and in the <HI>East-Indies</HI> too, manifestly insult∣ed, or audaciously invaded.</P>
<P>It were a Presumption deserving your Indignation and Censure, to dare to point out to your Wisdoms the Ways and Means, or any expedient needful to be us'd for raising the Supply in this pressing Extremity.
<PB N="34" REF="007574_0031_102D7C0C944BD8B8"/>But surely I keep within my proper Sphere, while in general Terms I only urge what my sacred Function exacts from me, as a bounden Duty. I wou'd not found forth an Alarm for romantic Expeditions in chi∣merical Perils; but, I confess, I wou'd <HI>blew the Trum∣pet in Zion</HI> rather with some Degree of honest Enthu∣siasm, than with a feeble Blast, for kindling public Spirit in real Danger, and prevent, as a Priest of the sacred Altar, that pure, Guardian, <HI>Vestal,</HI> Fire from ever being extinguish'd among us.</P>
<P>Let me then conjure von to weigh the high Conse∣quence of these noble Colonies, for your own Sakes, as well as on Account of your Mother Country; who, having been the powerful Protectress, and careful Nurse of your Insancy, has not remitted her parental Care, even when you are grown to a State of juvenile Vigour; and it would be equally ingrateful and shameful not to act in Conjunction with her other Offspring in your common Defence, but still with childish Cries call upon her for further Aid, when you are at an Age, more than qualify'd to defend yourselves; especially as she is loaded with an Eighty Million Debt, (besides the vast annual Expences she is at in maintaining, for <HI>So∣vereignty</HI> at Sea, a naval Force; and in supporting her other military and civil Lists) a Debt, contracted for the Protection of her Laws, Liberties, and Religion, against a Succession of <HI>Popish Pretenders</HI> to our Crown; and against their chief Patrons; those very Foes, im∣placable and inveterate, who now menace yourselves; and who are pursuing her with their Malice in the re∣motest Parts of her Dominions; never letting the Sun
<PB N="35" REF="007574_0032_102D7C0EE74A1B00"/>set on their Depredations; and wounding her most sensibly through your Sides.</P>
<P>The first Principle of Nature calls on you, on the one Part, and Gratitude and Justice on the other, to distinguish yourselves on this Occasion, and rather to set an Example than to wait for one from your Neigh∣bours, by paying back chearfully, in a Mutuality of good Offices, and a generous Retribution, a small Por∣tion, a Pittance, of what you owe her for your present Subsistence, as well as your original Existence. Let me tell you, my worthy Countrymen, the Eyes of your Constituents are now upon you, who as far as my Sphere of Observation extends, will searce applaud you at your Return to your several Counties for being un∣seasonably frugal, or too indulgent to their Pockets against their Inclinations. They are <HI>Britons,</HI> and, when not misled by the Tales of designing Men, <HI>such,</HI> as will not grudge a Day or two of extraordinary La∣bour in the Field to support this Overture for national Benefit. The Eyes of your Sister-Colonies are upon you, who will be agitated by Shame or Rivalship to take their Measures from your Pattern. Assume then, the Glory of making your Pattern the Master-Spring of their Motion!—The Eyes of your venerable Mother-Nation will be upon you, who requires and expects, that in Proportion, as her own inviolable Products, and your Staples of Trade and Intercourse are recipro∣cally lucrative, you wou'd imitate her Parliaments in a suitable Conduct, when <HI>French</HI> Invasions are threaten'd; and no longer be amus'd, like our Commissaries in <HI>Paris,</HI> by the futile, and time-spinning Wrangles, or
<PB N="36" REF="007574_0033_102D7C10F8BBF4D0"/>by all the stale Chicanery of a Treaty-making and Treaty-breaking <HI>Race;</HI> but crush at a Blow the <HI>Cro∣cadile</HI> in the Egg-Shell.—Nay, Gentlemen, the <HI>Argus'</HI> Eyes of the very <HI>French</HI> are upon you, who, by their various and conceal'd Emissaries, undisguis'd Jesuits, pardon'd Rebels, and traiterous Malecontents, will have dispatch'd to them at <HI>Quebec,</HI> or even <HI>Paris,</HI> the Accounts of your Proceedings, with more Speed, than they can be transmitted home. You shou'd con∣sider, How well acquainted they are with the defence∣less Condition of our various Colonies, and that they are hence embolden'd to undertake these destructive Projects; that, while they are carrying on a Chain of Forts of incredible Length behind us, almost from the <HI>Tropic</HI> to the Polar Circle, from new <HI>Orleans</HI> and the Bay of <HI>Mexico</HI> to beyond that of <HI>St. Laurence</HI> North∣ward, and within a trifling Distance of our chief Places for the Fur-Trade at the Bottom of <HI>James</HI>'s Bay; that while they are ever and anon edging on us from the West, and striving to confine us to a comparatively∣narrow Slip of Land by hemming us in between the <HI>Apalachean</HI> Hills and the Ocean; that while they are laying the Foundations of a Monarchy, greater than the four ancient Ones together, and extend their enor∣mous <HI>Louisiana</HI> in their impudent Maps and hot Ima∣ginations to the very South-Seas, and perhaps to <HI>Japan;</HI> that while they are doing, or contriving to do all this, we lie expos'd to their Insults and Depredations, with∣out Fortifications, Magazines, and warlike Stores, or even a disciplin'd <HI>Militia</HI> to defend us against any sud∣den Hostility; so that if they were to take it into their Heads (which they are very capable of doing, even
<PB N="37" REF="007574_0034_102D7C12C49D2AE8"/>without waiting for a Proclamation of Was) to make a quick March upon this, or either of the two bordering Colonies, with but Two Thousand Men of the regular Troops of <HI>France,</HI> attended with as many of their Woodrangers and <HI>Indian</HI> Allies, they wou'd find no∣thing to obstruct their Course till the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Ocean stopp'd them; but won'd over run us at once, and with the same Rapidity and Violence that the back Forests sometimes suffer, when at a general Hunting the Woods are set on Fire by the Natives. You shou'd consider, that though <HI>the Zeal of their House may often eat them up;</HI>—That though their Zeal, I say, may be too volatile frequently, yet our's for that very Reason ought never to be too Phlegmatic; that though they now and then overshoot the Mark by too sanguine Hopes and hasty Aims, yet generally their Projects are the Result of long and deep Thinking, and laid far in Futurity, whereas many of us scarce consider even the present Time; in short, that they first deliberate cooly, and then execute speedily.—You shou'd consider how much it is your Duty to have a watchful Eye on all known, and suspected Enemies of the Government; to prevent the Poison of their salfe Rumours and secret Caballing from spreading among his Majesty's good Sub∣jects; and to obstruct as much as possible, by empower∣ing the Magistrates to act with Vigilance and Vigor, that Intelligence, which the Enemy hourly have of our Designs, and We rarely of theirs:—For it is melan∣choly to think of what I am well-affur'd, as I am of all other Facts here set down, that they have a high Way of Information, often travell'd through from <HI>Al∣bany,</HI> and other Places of ours, to <HI>Montreal</HI> and
<PB N="38" REF="007574_0035_102D7C1494C012A0"/>the Parts adjacent. Every one of our Governments shou'd therefore offer Rewards for intercepting and de∣tecting through all their Shapes and Disguises, those <HI>Pretenses</HI> that annually stroll down among us from <HI>Georges</HI> to <HI>Neca-Scotia;</HI> for, (to use <HI>Joseph</HI>'s Words to his Brethren in <HI>Egypt) These Men are surely Spies; and by the Life of</HI> Pharoah, <HI>to pry into the Nakedness of the Land de they come.</HI>—You shou'd maturely consider, what Advantages, by your omitting this Op∣portunity they will have over you next Summer, when they unite their Forces to oppose you and maintain their Usurpations; that it is high Time to raise a suf∣ficient Force to give an immediate and decisive Blow; and that to receive another Defeat, or feebly to at∣tempt and fail again, wou'd be more fatal, than to sit still and make no Effort at all. You shou'd consider indeed what their grand Schemes really are; no less, than to unite, by seizing on the vast interjacent Regions, their Northern with their Southern Colonies, their <HI>Ca∣nada</HI> with their <HI>Missisippi;</HI> to six Garrisons on all the navigable Straits of the mighty Expanse of Mediterra∣nean fresh-water Seas, <HI>Ontario, Erie, Huron, Illinois,</HI> and the <HI>Superieur</HI> Lake; behind which there are others, that probably communicate both with <HI>Hudson</HI>'s Bay and the Pacific Ocean; as these do with one another. You shou'd consider that the great Object of their im∣mediate Ambition is, to obtain a commodious Port on the <HI>Atlantic</HI> Main; (which their Engineers wou'd soon take Care to render stronger, as more important, than <HI>Louisburg</HI> is now by additional Works, and new Bat∣teries) that, cou'd this be done, it wou'd be the first step to compleat their unbounded Hopes, and that the
<PB N="39" REF="007574_0036_102D7C16D2D4B978"/>Places, which present themselves principally to their Ambition are the River of <HI>Hudson,</HI> and the Bay of <HI>Chesapeak;</HI> that their Designs were only providenti∣ally frustrated on the former by the Dissipation of their formidable Fleet under Duke <HI>D'Anville;</HI> by which they intended to have taken and fortify'd for them∣selves, our defenceless Town of <HI>New-York,</HI> at the Mouth of it; while at the same Time a Land-Army, rendevouzing then near <HI>Montreal,</HI> was ready to move down by the Lake of <HI>Champlain</HI> to surprize our naked <HI>Albany</HI> towards the Forks of it; and thus all Commu∣nication had been cut off between our Southern and Nothern Colonies for mutual Defence, and an Asylum open'd for Swarms of Papists, Jacobites, Desperadoes, Convicts, and fugitive Negroes, to have join'd them, at the very Time, when an unnatural Rebellion at home, promoted chiefly by the <HI>French,</HI> was gnawing our Vitals, and an expensive War abroad was externally wasting us.—Had this Hell-concerted and Heaven∣disappointed Armament succeeded, and a <HI>Popish Pre∣tender</HI> been proclaim'd as our King, you may better conceive, than I describe, what direful Scenes of Blood and Horror, Protestants and loyal <HI>Britons</HI> had been in∣volv'd in; nor wou'd any of our Settlements have escap'd some Part of the Storm, though they are ex∣tended in Length for full Fifteen Hundred Miles on the Coast, and contain, by the best Information I can receive, at least One Million of Inhabitants: I Which, by the Bye, however, doubles the Number of the <HI>French</HI> on this Continent, even from their own exag∣gerating Accounts, though we reckon in all the <HI>Indians</HI> nationally blended with them, and their promiscuous
<PB N="40" REF="007574_0037_102D7C1864256B00"/>Posterity; now as good <HI>Frenchmen</HI> and Papists, as themselves, by their wise Methods of Adoption and Incorporation, which from the Beginning they never neglected, and we always shamefully despis'd!]—You will hence likewise please to consider, that the Supe∣riority of the <HI>French</HI> does not consist in a Continuity of Settlements, like ours: (Being more disperst in the vast Wilderness, and corresponding chiefly by Means of Blockhouses, Forts, and Trading-Places, at stated Dis∣tances on the <HI>Missisippi, Ohio,</HI> and Straits of the Lakes.) Nor does it consist in Numbers of Men, or Courage; in neither of which, we know, they are yet comparable to us: But in dextrons Cunning, Ambuscading, poli∣tical Intriguing, ready Obedience to civil or military Command, and in a natural Vivacity and Alertness in Action, they certainly excel us; as they fatally do in a Knewlege of the Use of Arms; being all from their Boyhood train'd up to it, muster'd and disciplin'd by Veteran and <HI>European</HI> Officers; and, above all, in a Consolidation of Interests and Councils, being firmly united, though so widely scatter'd, under one Chief in supreme Command, the <HI>Governor-General</HI> in <HI>Canada:</HI> Whereas our Provinces, though so happily located, are disseminated in Mind; and seldom can be brought to act with Unanimity.—You are therefore to supply this Defect, by which only despotic Governments have the Advantage of free States, with all possible Prudence, in your Negociations and Conjunctions with contiguous Colonies, that we may firmly associate, without tedious Adjustments of trifling Punctilios, for common Preservation: But most especially it is now necessary, that a mutual Confidence be settled with
<PB N="41" REF="007574_0038_102D7C1A68063740"/>the Cement of fraternal Affection between the Legis∣lative Powers of this Province; for where this Corner-Stone is wanting, we build in vain; and a manifest Tendency to Anarchy and Confusion ensues.—If this is preserv'd in your Debates, and those of your neigh∣bouring Assemblies, no reasonable Man (humanly speaking) can any more doubt of a happy Issue to our glorious Undertaking, than of its Expediency and Ne∣cessity:—We are not only invited, but compell'd into it: The Enemy are at our Doors: They are in∣trenching, and fortressing in our Borders: They have slaughter'd our <HI>Virginian</HI> Forces; and driven from their Habitations great Numbers of distrest, outlying Families, and industrious Adventurers, who might o∣therwise, by rapid Progress, advance the <HI>British</HI> Fron∣tiers and the Christian Religion. They have intercept∣ed our beneficial Southern Fur-Trade, and by the vilest Artifices render'd us cheap and suspectable in the Eyes of our ally'd <HI>Indians;</HI> particularly the <HI>Five Nations,</HI> some Tribes of whom have seceded from their League, and migrated to themselves; as, if not more powerful Protectors; yet to be rely'd on, as more sted∣fast Friends. They have perverted Multitudes of honest heathen Clans into <HI>christen'd</HI> Demons. Their <HI>Rome-imp'd</HI> Priests have refin'd simple Savages into human Tygers, and to enlarge their Creed have totally corrupted whatever they knew of Morals before.— They wou'd now by Preoccupation, in Order to ground a Right to future, and still-growing Claims, engross that charming Country, from the Sources of the <HI>Ohio</HI> to its Conflux with the <HI>Ouabach,</HI> which is truly worth fighting for in a righteous Cause, and is compar'd for
<PB N="42" REF="007574_0039_102D7C1C39786ED0"/>delicious Prospect and Fertility, to the Plains of <HI>Milan,</HI> the Garden of <HI>Italy,</HI> surrounded, and interspers'd with celebrated Lakes and Rivers; if indeed great Things, without being too much degraded, may admit a Com∣parison with small; a widely-expanded Landscape with a Pocket-Picture in Miniature; such a Brook as the <HI>Po</HI> with the <HI>Missisippi;</HI> or such little Fishponds as <HI>Garda,</HI> and <HI>Maggiore</HI> with such <HI>E<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>xines</HI> and <HI>Cas∣pians,</HI> as the Waters of the <HI>Erie</HI> and <HI>Huron.</HI></P>
<P>Gentlemen of both <HI>Houses,</HI> As you are Guardians of the present Race, and Trustees of Posterity, stop in Time their Progress, since none know where it will otherwise End. O stop it in Time! Secure those blissful Regions, as a Jewel of the greatest Magnitude and Splendor in the <HI>British</HI> Crown, to be worn for ever by <HI>illustrious Descendants</HI> from King <HI>George;</HI> and to be exhaustless Reservations for your own Children, when these multiplying Provinces are overstock'd with People, as they will soon be from their natural Increase only. Remember the brave Atchievements of your Brethren of <HI>New-England</HI> in the late War: Think, how an Handful of undisciplin'd Farmers, fresh from the Plow, took the Bull by the Horns, possess'd them∣selves of their <HI>impregnable Cape-Breton,</HI> and, in its Rendition, as an Equivalent for all <HI>Flanders,</HI> purchas'd a Peace for <HI>Europe.</HI> Think on the native Bravery of your own Inmates; who, among the other <HI>Americans</HI> eminently and lately distinguish'd themselves at <HI>Car∣thagesa;</HI> and convinc'd the World, that <HI>Maryland</HI> produc'd a Race of Heroes from her Forests, whose Lion-like Fierceness, in the Front of Fire and Death,
<PB N="43" REF="007574_0040_102D7C1DCC0ABBB0"/>was only censurable for its generous Excess.—Think, that your Troops (if a <HI>General</HI> of Seniority is not sent hither from <HI>Europe)</HI> will have a <HI>Chief</HI> of their own to lead them to Conquest; a <HI>Father,</HI> by his Employment and Inclination; who, by the previous Measures he has taken, the unwonted Intelligence he has obtain'd of the Country and Enemy, and his unweary'd Appli∣cation to the Grand-Concernment in every Particular, has given us encouraging Omens of Success, and that in his intended March and Attacks, he will obviate all former Difficulties, prevent future Miscarriages, and revenge the Blood of our Countrymen, unprofitably shed!—O think of all this, and think (I repeat it again) that much Frugality may be sometimes a Crime, as, in a good Cause, Lukewarmness is always one. Think, that a moderate Taxation now will be most certainly the greatest Oeconomy, and the Means of saving very heavy future Expences, if the Foe by our Neglect shou'd grow too potent in our Frontiers to be soon or easily ejected!—I remember the Time (not many Years ago) when, in this Town, those few Per∣sons, (among whom, it is known, I was one) who ex∣press'd their Apprehensions of <HI>French</HI> Attempts to make Settlements, where they since have done it to our Cost, found their Predictions receiv'd with but slender Impressions by many Men in popular Esteem for Sagacity. An Increase of Arms and Ammunition were then thought burthensome and useless and Inva∣sions from <HI>Utopia,</HI> or the Moon, wou'd have been as soon dreaded; as from the Quarters, whence we are now molested! But let us avoid all Retrospections in a Matter, that requires universal Amity and Concord.
<PB N="44" REF="007574_0041_102D7C21F5011F50"/>Let us acquaint ourselves better with <HI>French</HI> Politics and <HI>French</HI> Ambition. The History of every Nation in <HI>Eu∣rope</HI> will show ye, that their Monarchy has been grasping at supream Dominion there for near two Centuries; even at all, their <HI>Charlemagne</HI> once possess'd. <HI>Papery,</HI> too gross, too affrontive to common Sense, to be believ'd by their wise Men, is submitted to as their main Engine of State; and so wou'd <HI>Mabometism,</HI> if equally and essentially subservient to their grand Scheme; as we may well conjecture from their close Connexions with their best Allies, the <HI>Turks;</HI> having enter'd into an Agreement, as it shon'd seem, to keep the <HI>Grand Saignor</HI> on the Throne of <HI>Constantine,</HI> in Order to share with him, some Time or other, the best Part of <HI>Chris∣tendom.</HI> Their Perfidy in solemn Treaties is a trite Proverb; and among themselves they laugh at all those, as incorrigible Dupes, who still continue to trust or believe them. Their Arrogance carries them so far as to boast that they can easily make up any Misfor∣tune in War by their skill in the Cabinet, or at a Con∣gress. The <HI>Reason of their Kings</HI> is publish'd from the Mouths of their Cannons; and where their Clergy sail, Dragoons more powerfully convert. What they are capable of doing this Way, let the terrible Massa∣cre of <HI>Paris;</HI> and, if possible, the more horrid Revo∣cation of the Edict of <HI>Nantz,</HI> inform ye: Not to dwell on what you know from every Gazette, their present Barbarities to their own Countrymen and Fellow-Sub∣jects in <HI>Languedoc;</HI> nor on their hellish <HI>Crusadoes</HI> of Yore against the miserable <HI>Albigenses,</HI> chiefly for not believing, that a Bit of Bread, to be chew'd, devour'd, and digested by a Rat or a Mouse, as well as them∣selves
<PB N="45" REF="007574_0042_102D7C23C89EA270"/>cou'd not be transubstantiated by the mumbled Words of a priestly Conjuror into the <HI>Flesh</HI> of GOD!— Yes, these are they, who, being setter'd themselves, wou'd bring you under the same Yoke, and like the Rival of their Pride and Ambition, the Devil, envy you that Happiness, (a standing Reproach to Fiends and Slaves!) from which they are for ever excluded! These, Gentle∣men, are the Foes you are to engage with; the emi∣grant Successors of those, whom your heroic Predeces∣sors so often vanquish'd, plucking the Plume of Tri∣umph from their Crests; and whose Capital Kingdom they more than once over run from <HI>Dan</HI> to <HI>Beersheba!</HI> Turn over the Pages of your shining Annals, and while you read of what has been done in the Fields of <HI>Cressy, Poictiers, Agencourt</HI> and <HI>Blenheim,</HI> tell your bound∣ing Hearts the same Blood enriches your own Veins, and ensures approaching Victory! Ye Sons of the <HI>Refor∣mation,</HI> confirm'd by the Death of so many bright Mar∣tyrs, guard your holy Religion from <HI>Papal</HI> Persecution, Idolatry, <HI>Irish</HI> Massacres, Gun-Powder-Treasons, and worse than <HI>Smithfield</HI> Fires!—Protect your Estates, your Laws, your Liberties, Ye Assertors of the glorious <HI>Revolution,</HI> from foreign Tyranny, though menac'd only at the greatest Distance.—Yet,—GOD forbid, that you shou'd use any Unchristian Methods even for com∣passing these good Ends; or shou'd conceive those ne∣farious Means warrantable in the Service of the best Cause, which our subtle Adversaries make no Scruple <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Maintenance of the worst! Whatever <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> their Conduct, especially in their <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> us not disdain to imitate. Let <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <HI>Serpents,</HI> but innocent as
<PB N="46" REF="007574_0043_102D7C25552354C8"/>real Doves. Let the very Sounds of <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> swell your Indignation, but not diminish your Charity! —Internal Sisters! That stalk Hand in Hand to∣gether, blasting alike the moral and natural Creation; spreading a twofold Pestilence around! Detestable Reli∣gion; which only the most outrageous Tyranny can sustain!—Abominable Tyranny; which can only be mutually supported by Doctrines, shocking even to un∣prejudic'd Canibals!</P>
<P>Under the public Provocations, which some virulent <HI>Papists,</HI> perhaps encourag'd by the Proximity of the <HI>French,</HI> have lately given, though condemn'd by their less sanguine, and more discreet Partizans, I do not wonder that we are <HI>generally,</HI> because <HI>justly</HI> alarm'd: But I cou'd wish, that the sole Object of the present short Session shou'd be the necessary Supply for hastening the Expedition, which ought not to be retarded by any other Avocation; for what is truly expedient may be sometimes unseasonable, if it may be safely postpon'd to a succeeding Opportunity of more deliberate Enquiry. Then without Cruelty to their Persons, or overstraining the Laws, let us muzzle the <HI>Bear,</HI> or out off the <HI>Tyger</HI>'s Fangs, and take all speedy, Parliamentary, and Christian Methods for Self-Security. I am satisfy'd there are some <HI>Roman</HI> Catholic Gentlemen of Fortune and Family, both here and in <HI>England,</HI> who do not swallow implicitly all the Impo∣sitions of that Church, though they hold external Com∣munion with it; and the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> with whom the Mission of these Parts is solely entrusted, are too wisely indulgent not to come to a Sort of Composition with
<PB N="47" REF="007574_0044_102D7C2727054200"/>Men of Sense in those Points, which they know how to slur over; and are asham'd to defend, what they cannot believe themselves, except to the Vulgar. Such Persons, though they might in general relish an esta∣blish'd <HI>French</HI> Religion, are not so far gone in Madness as to wish to live under a <HI>French</HI> Government.— However this be, it is an Article of my Creed as firmly believ'd as any other, that all Men have a natural Right to remain unmolested for Opinions, meerly con∣scientious, however absurd in themselves, or discordant with mine; but when these apparently tend to the Destruction of the State, and their Toleration becomes incompatible with it's Safety; then it is incumbent on the civil Establishment, by the same Sanction of Nature, either totally to suppress them, or keep them under such Restrictions of penal or preventive Statutes, as may be judg'd sufficient for our present and suture Security.</P>
<P>But lest I exhaust that Patience, I have, I sear, too long try'd, I shall conclude all, with once more im∣ploring you most pathetically to reflect, that you are <HI>Britons!</HI> A Term, that shou'd comprehend, in it's true Desinition, every Social, every Christian Virtue; and exclude from it's Idea all narrow Notions, meerly local Views, and mean-spirited Images.—All, who live under the Umbrage of old <HI>England</HI>'s Laws: All, who are ready to the last Gasp, and to the last Far∣thing to defend the Acquisitions of their Ancestors In∣dustry and Virtue in the <HI>European</HI> and <HI>American</HI> Em∣pires of our common King; with their Lives and For∣tunes, I say: These, all these, give the only intallible Proof of their Right of Denizenship, and are true Bre∣thren,
<PB N="48" REF="007574_0045_102D7C28DB9101C0"/>and the legal Sons and Coheirs of their General Mother; while all they, who wou'd unhinge her ex∣cellent Appointments in Church or State, betray her Rights, or even supinely behold her Dangers, are not only Parricides, but <HI>Aliens</HI> too, though born in the Midst of her great Metropolis.</P>
<P>O then, as you wou'd deserve that glorious Appel∣lation; as you are intimately concern'd in the Conse∣quences of the momentous Event, that has summon'd you now extraordinarily; as you are under the more peculiar Obligations of Honour, Trust, and Conscience, to promote the Happiness of the Community; of which you are not bare Members, but Rulers and Patrons: As you will answer it to your GOD; your King; your Young and Noble Proprietary; and your own Constituents: O permit not the Zeal of a true Public Spirit to cool in your Breasts; but on this, and all other, worthy Occasions, improve it in yourselves; kin∣dle, encrease it in others; and transmit the hallow'd Principle to your Children's Children; to latest Posteri∣ty; till only the Day of Judgment and the Kingdom of CHRIST put a Period to the <HI>British</HI> Dominion in our <HI>New World;</HI> or till Time shall be lost in Eter∣nity! And, For this you will be attended with public Prayers and Blessings upon Earth, as Universal Bene∣factors; and shine in distinguishable Glory hereafter, even as <HI>the Stars of Light in the Firmament of Hea∣ven, for ever and ever!</HI>—Amen!—</P>
