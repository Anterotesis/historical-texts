<P>Unto me, who am less than the least of all Saints is this Grace given; that I should preach among the Gentiles the unsearchable Riches of Christ.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">I</SEG>N these humble and lofty Words the <HI>Apostle</HI> lays <HI>himself</HI> low, while he mag∣nifies his <HI>Office,</HI> and exalts the free <HI>Grace</HI> of God that call'd him into it, qualify'd him for it and assisted him in it.</P>
<P N="1">1. HE magnifies his <HI>Office</HI> as the <HI>Apostle of the Gen∣tiles.</HI> It was a great Honour and special Dignity in the Kingdom of Christ and of Grace. With this the <HI>Chap∣ter</HI> begins, <Q>I Paul, the Prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles! If ye have heard of the Dispensation of the Grace of God, which is given me to you ward.</Q> The Gospel of the <HI>Uncircumcision</HI> was given to <HI>Paul,</HI> as that of the <HI>Circumcision</HI> was unto <HI>Peter.</HI> Not but that they both preached occasionally to <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gen∣tiles,</HI> but <HI>Peter's</HI> Mission was more especially to the
<PB N="2" REF="003520_0004_0FF855D145F2F6E8"/>One, and <HI>Paul's</HI> to the Other. When the LORD appeared to him in the Light from Heaven on the Way, he then declar'd him to be <HI>a chosen Vessel to bear his Name before the Gentiles.</HI> This was his <HI>Mitre</HI> and e∣steemed Crown, this the mighty <HI>See</HI> into which he was chosen. 1 Tim. ii. 7. <HI>I am ordained a Teacher of the Gentiles in Faith and Verity.</HI> It is strange that the <HI>Gentiles</HI> should not magnify their <HI>own</HI> Apostle; that the <HI>Roman Church</HI> should give the <HI>Primacy</HI> to <HI>Peter.</HI> In this <HI>Paul</HI> came not a whit behind the very <HI>Chief</HI> of the Apostles, yet he was <HI>Metropolitan of the Gentiles,</HI> but not <HI>of Man,</HI> neither <HI>by Man,</HI> but by <HI>Jesus Christ and God the Father,</HI> Gal. i. 1.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Gentiles</HI> were alike <HI>Souls</HI> and <HI>Sinners,</HI> that need∣ed a Saviour, as the <HI>Jews.</HI> The Jews indeed call'd them <HI>uncircumcised and unclean,</HI> and they had lost the Knowledge of God, and were defiled with abominable Idolatries and Impurities. Yet <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets</HI> had spoken abundantly of their Conversion; that CHRIST should be <HI>a Light to lighten the Gentiles, and for Salvation to the Ends of the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Gentiles</HI> were vastly <HI>more</HI> for Numbers, Power, Riches, Literature, worldly Name and Glory, than the <HI>few and feeble Jews</HI> were. They were mighty Nations, potent Kingdoms, populous Cities and vast Empires; while <HI>Judea</HI> was sunk into a tributary Province, or de∣pendant Kingdom on proud <HI>Rome.</HI> The Gentiles were <HI>Rome, Athens, Corinth</HI> and the <HI>Schools of Greece,</HI> who then divided the Learning of the World among them. To convert <HI>These</HI> to the Faith of Christ was <HI>Paul</HI> called and sent from Heaven, and well might he say, — <HI>That to me this Grace is given!</HI> Wherefore</P>
<P N="2">2. HE lays <HI>Himself very low,</HI> "To me, who am <HI>less than the least</HI> of all Saints is this Grace given, that <HI>I</HI> should preach among the Gentiles &amp;c.</P>
<P><Q>HERE is a double <HI>Diminutive,</HI> says One; He was as little as <HI>could be</HI> in his own Eyes, and therefore writes himself so little as could <HI>not</HI> be; <HI>less than the least.</HI></Q> <HI>Longe minimus;</HI> by far the least, <HI>Minimissimo;</HI> He was a <HI>Minim,</HI> an Animalcule in his own Eyes, after all that Heaven had done to aggrandize him. So <HI>before Honour
<PB N="3" REF="003520_0005_0FF855D2C9EC3110"/>is Humility,</HI> and true Humility increases with Worth and Excellency, and the Honours of Providence. The <HI>Apostle</HI> always look'd back on what he <HI>had been</HI> before his Calling into the Apostleship of Christ: 1 Cor. xv. 9. <HI>I am not meet to be called an Apostle because I persecuted the Church of God</HI> 1 Tim. 1.13. <HI>Who was before a Blas∣phemer, a Persecutor and Injurious; but I obtained Mercy.</HI> He therefore speaks <HI>highly</HI> of himself in the Text, where he calls himself the <HI>least of Saints;</HI> if compar'd with what he says elsewhere, "<HI>I am the chief of Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>YET in the <HI>Text,</HI> 1. He acknowledges himself thro' Grace among the <HI>Saints.</HI> And 2. Most <HI>highly</HI> honour∣ed and dignified among them: 1. In his <HI>Mission</HI> to the <HI>Gentiles.</HI> 2. In his <HI>Ministry,</HI> to preach <HI>Christ</HI> and his <HI>Riches</HI> to them.</P>
<P>Now in all this the blessed <HI>Apostle</HI> is a shining <HI>Ex∣ample</HI> and <HI>Monitor</HI> to all of us, both Ministers and Peo∣ple; 1. That we should be <HI>Saints.</HI> 2. Yet always in our own Eyes the <HI>least</HI> of them, and <HI>less</HI> than the least. And 3. That we should be exceeding <HI>affected</HI> with the singular <HI>Grace</HI> of God to us, that <HI>we</HI> should be called into his Kingdom, whether to <HI>preach</HI> the unsearchable Riches of Christ to others, or to have the same <HI>preached</HI> to us.</P>
<P>LET the <HI>Doctrines</HI> then be,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. WE are all called to be <HI>Saints,</HI> both Ministers and People; and the <HI>Ministers</HI> of Christ are more especially bound to be so.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. THE <HI>best</HI> of Ministers and the best of Saints should be and will be in their own Eyes <HI>less</HI> than the least of 'em.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. HUMBLE <HI>Saints,</HI> whoever they be, whither Mini∣sters or People, will be <HI>greatly affected</HI> with the <HI>Grace</HI> of God to them, that <HI>they</HI> should have Christ and his unsearchable Riches <HI>preached</HI> to them, or be called of God to <HI>preach</HI> Him unto others:</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I can speak but <HI>little</HI> to these great Truths, within the Limits allowed me; I will endeavour to fill up that Little with the more <HI>Light and Heat;</HI> and crave the more <HI>diligent</HI> Attention from you.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="4" REF="003520_0006_0FF855D50F2211B8"/>
I. DOCT. <HI>WE are all called to be Saints, both Mini∣sters and People, and the Ministers of Christ are more especially bound to be so.</HI> To <HI>me</HI> the least of <HI>Saints;</HI> says the <HI>Apostle.</HI> He puts <HI>himself</HI> into this blessed Number; but he speaks of all the <HI>Congregations</HI> and <HI>Churches</HI> of Saints. The <HI>Minister</HI> to be sure implies the <HI>Christian,</HI> and if the <HI>Members</HI> of the Churches wear the Name of <HI>Saints,</HI> the <HI>Pastors</HI> of them should be nothing less.</P>
<P>MINISTERS should be <HI>holy Men of God,</HI> like the Prophet <HI>Elisha,</HI> in the Spirit of <HI>Elias;</HI> and like <HI>Aaron the Saint of the Lord,</HI> on the Front of whose <HI>Mitre</HI> was written, <HI>Holiness to the Lord.</HI> When <HI>Moses</HI> pray'd for the Tribe of <HI>Levi,</HI> his <HI>own</HI> Tribe, and for the House of his <HI>Brother</HI> chosen to the Priesthood; to the Mini∣stry at the Sanctuary, and to teach <HI>Jacob</HI> God's Judg∣ments and <HI>Israel</HI> his Laws; "LORD, said he, <HI>let thy Urim be with thy Holy Ones.</HI> Their <HI>Separation</HI> to holy Ministrations put the Name of <HI>Sanctity</HI> and Holiness upon them, was a <HI>Profession</HI> of it and strong <HI>Obligation</HI> to it. It could not indeed <HI>make</HI> them holy in Heart and Life, but it was a <HI>Bond</HI> upon their Soul. As <HI>Aaron</HI> was told in the Presence of all <HI>Israel,</HI> on a solemn Day and upon a most awful Dispensation; Lev. v. 3. <HI>I will be sanctified in Them that draw nigh Me.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GOD</HI> is Holy, infinitely <HI>holy.</HI> A <HI>Man</HI> in special Re∣lation to God, solemnly devoted to Him and imployed for Him, to serve in his House and Worship, and to mi∣nister under his Grace to the Sanctification and Salva∣tion of Souls; is laid under the highest Engagements to be Himself holy. Ezek. xx. 41. <HI>I will accept you with your sweet Savour, and will be sanctified in You.</HI></P>
<P>WELL therefore did the <HI>Apostle</HI> name Himself One among the <HI>Saints</HI> of God, the <HI>sanctified in Jesus Christ.</HI> Had he not been one of that <HI>Noble Order,</HI> he had not been meet to have been named an <HI>Apostle.</HI> The End and Scope of his Ministry was to make Men <HI>Saints,</HI> by the Power and Blessing of the <HI>Holy Ghost.</HI> He durst not deny what he was by the Grace of God. The Churches were Witnesses how <HI>holily &amp; unblameably</HI> he behav'd before them. He would not be reputed unsanctified, unholy or profane. If he had not been sanctified from the <HI>Womb,</HI> like <HI>Jeremiah,</HI> and ordain'd a Prophet to the
<PB N="5" REF="003520_0007_0FF855D6D48D3B00"/>Nations; yet on the Day that the <HI>Heavenly Light</HI> struck him to the Ground, his Eyes were opened and his Heart was changed. Christ sent him qualified and spirit∣ed as he had done the other Apostles; over whom and for whom He had prayed. Joh. xvii. 19. <HI>For their sakes I sanctify my self, that they may be sanctified.</HI> The un∣clean Spirits therefore confess'd his Ministry &amp; Saintship; "<HI>Jesus I know, and Paul I know.</HI></P>
<P>AND if <HI>Ministers</HI> should be Saints, so ought <HI>Christian People</HI> also. They are <HI>called to be Saints,</HI> even <HI>all that in every place call upon the Name of Christ,</HI> 1 Cor. i. 2. <HI>All</HI> the Lord's Congregation should be <HI>Holy.</HI> They are under the Sign and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>nd of <HI>Holy Baptism</HI> The LORD has loved the Church, and given Himself for it, <HI>to sancti∣fy and cleanse it</HI> with the washing of Water, by the Word. These are the outward Sign &amp; Means of Regeneration and inward Holiness. <HI>There is one Body and one Spirit, even as ye are called in one Hope; One Lord, one Faith, one Baptism:</HI> And if the ascended <HI>Jesus</HI> has received <HI>Gifts</HI> for Men, some <HI>Apostles,</HI> some <HI>Pastors</HI> &amp; <HI>Teachers;</HI> and pour'd out his Sanctifying <HI>Spirit</HI> on them; It is for the Edifying of <HI>his Body,</HI> and to present unto Himself <HI>a glorious Church, not have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> spot or wrinkle.</HI> This there∣fore we wish (pray and preach for) your <HI>Sanctification!</HI> That <HI>the Offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost;</HI> That <HI>the God of Peace may sanctify you wholly, in Body Soul and Spirit; and preserve you blameless to the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P>As soon as the LORD had formed a <HI>visible</HI> Church and Ministry, this was the <HI>Message</HI> to 'em and by 'em; Lev. xix. 2. <HI>Speak unto all the Congregation, and say to them, ye shall be Holy, for I the Lord your God am Holy.</HI> And again, xx. 7. <HI>Sanctify your selves,—for I am the Lord that sanctifieth you.</HI> And to the End of Scripture this is the Character of Christians. Heb. iii. 1. <HI>Holy Brethren, Par∣takers of the Heavenly Calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our Profession, Jesus Christ.</HI> 1 Pet. i. 15. <HI>As He which has called you is holy, so be ye holy.</HI></P>
<P>LET what has been said be an awful ADMONITION and constraining <HI>Motive</HI> to us all, both Ministers &amp; People, to see to our <HI>Conversion</HI> to God; that a saving <HI>Change</HI> be passed on us; that we be regenerated and born again;
<PB N="6" REF="003520_0008_0FF855D912961E20"/>that the good Work of God be indeed begun and going on in our Souls; that when the Lord our GOD shall come and <HI>all his Saints</HI> with Him, <HI>we</HI> may not be missed among them: after our visible Relation to him, &amp; Pro∣fession of his Name; and after we have so often heard and preached that Word of his Grace, <HI>which is able to build us up, and to give us an Inheritance among all them that are sanctified.</HI></P>
<P>LET us lie in the Dust before the <HI>Holy One,</HI> and in the Presence of all his Saints, for all our <HI>Unholiness</HI> in Heart and Life, under our special Obligations, Advantages and Professions; and let us be abhorring our selves and re∣penting in Dust &amp; Ashes. Yea let us tremble as <HI>Isaiah</HI> did, when he saw the <HI>Holy Ones</HI> covering their Faces be∣fore the Throne of <HI>Christ,</HI> and heard them cry before Him, <HI>Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hosts!</HI> Isai. vi. 5. <HI>Then said I, Wo is me, for I am undone! because I am a Man of unclean Lips, and I dwell among a People of un∣clean Lips.</HI></P>
<P>MORE particularly, I must take the Opportunity now given me of God to admonish those that are <HI>Candidates for the Ministry:</HI> Before and above all their preparatory Studies, and Amassment (by the Will of God) of proper Science and Literature; that they do in the first place seek of God <HI>this</HI> more necessary Foundation for a Gos∣pel Minister, and more abundant Qualification for One; namely, <HI>a blessed Regeneration,</HI> and a <HI>sound Conversion</HI> to God; That you may be indeed Sanctified by the <HI>Spirit</HI> before you be Ordained to the Work of the Lord; And that you have an inward Call of God within your own Soul to His holy Ministry, before you accept of any Call from the People of God, <HI>to watch for their Souls as One that must give an Account.</HI> We pray <HI>Christ Jesus the Lord</HI> thus <HI>to enable you, counting you faithful, and putting you into the Ministry.</HI></P>
<P>AND as for the <HI>People of God,</HI> here is a plain but most important <HI>Direction</HI> to them, in their <HI>Choice of a Pastor;</HI> Chuse One whom you have Reason to esteem a <HI>Saint,</HI> a converted and sanctified Person, who will follow after <HI>Holiness,</HI> and labour for <HI>your Conversion</HI> and Salvation; naturally caring for his own and your Souls, <HI>to save him∣self and them that hear him</HI> — And so I dismiss the <HI>first Doctrine,</HI> "We are all called to be <HI>Saints,</HI> both Mini∣sters and People.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="7" REF="003520_0009_0FF855DB40433708"/>
II. DOCT. <HI>THE best of Ministers and of Saints, will be and should be in their own Eyes the least of all Saints.</HI> This becomes, adorns and exalts Those that most excel in Grace; "<HI>That to me who am less than the least of all Saints!</HI> This Humility and <HI>Lowliness</HI> of the great A∣postle, <HI>magnify</HI> him for ever in the Eyes of all Saints, and leave him an Illustrious <HI>Example</HI> to them. <HI>Paul</HI> learn'd it of <HI>Christ,</HI> who has said to us all, "<HI>Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly of Heart.</HI> When <HI>He</HI> saw the Begin∣nings of <HI>Pride</HI> and Emulation among the <HI>Twelve,</HI> he took a <HI>little Child</HI> and set him in the midst of them, and said, "<HI>He that shall humble himself as this little Child, the same is greatest in my Kingdom.</HI> The <HI>Apostles</HI> never for∣got this Teaching Action and mild Reproof, but three of the <HI>Evangelists</HI> have put it on Record. Truly the Signs of a <HI>Minister</HI> of Christ are <HI>these: "Serving the Lord with all Humility;</HI> <Q><HI>Gentle among You &amp; toward all Men; In Meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; Yea all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> be subject one to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> with Humility;</HI></Q> "<HI>For the Servant of the Lord must not strive.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>contrary</HI> to this is the special Character of the <HI>Devil</HI> and of <HI>Antichrist. Pride</HI> cast <HI>Satan</HI> down from his high Seat among the Angels of Light; And He that is entring on the Ministry of Christ is in particular warn'd of <HI>this</HI> Sin and Danger; "That he be <HI>not a "Novice</HI> (a conceited vain aspiring Youth, aiming at Prehemi∣nence and Applause) <HI>lest he fall into the Condemnation of the Devil,</HI> 1 Tim. iii. 6. — You see the Danger that <HI>High Intelligences</HI> are in of this Sin. So <HI>Angels</HI> fell, and so <HI>Adam</HI> after them. Let our <HI>learned Youth</HI> beware of this early Sin, that easily besets 'em, betrays 'em and casts 'em down. Let the <HI>Angels of the Churches</HI> see their Danger in their high Station.</P>
<P><HI>POOR and proud</HI> is a common and mean thing in a miserable World; too common in the <HI>Schools</HI> and in the <HI>Churches</HI> of our LORD JESUS. Such were the <HI>false Pro∣phets</HI> of old, and he that struck <HI>Micaiah</HI> on the Mouth, seduced by a lying insolent Spirit. And such were the <HI>false Apostles,</HI> boasting of a false Gift, and thinking them∣selves Something when they were Nothing; <HI>puff'd up with a fleshly Mind.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003520_0010_0FF855DDB1E1A740"/>
THE special Mark and Bloat of <HI>Antichrist</HI> is <HI>spiritual and worldly Pride</HI> blended together. This mixture forms the <HI>Beast,</HI> after which the World wonders. He wears the <HI>Name</HI> of Christ; and shows the <HI>Pride</HI> of Satan. You have his odious Face and monstrous Shape, 2 Thes ii. 3, 5. <HI>That Man of Sin and Son of Perdition, who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that He as God fitteth in the Temple of God, shewing Himself that he is God.</HI> This is plainly the <HI>Romish Hierarchy,</HI> that pretended <HI>Spiritual Dominion</HI> of Christ's erecting here on Earth, whereof the <HI>Pope</HI> is Head; calling himself the <HI>Servant of Servants,</HI> and yet claiming Lordship and Authority over the <HI>Minds</HI> and Consciences of Men, and also over the <HI>Kings</HI> &amp; Poten∣tates of the Earth. Such a <HI>Medley</HI> &amp; Affectation of the Humility and Lowliness of Christ, and yet of worldly Power and Pomp, Riches and Glory, Dignities &amp; Titles, Revenues and Temporalities; from the <HI>Cardinal's</HI> Cap to the <HI>Capuchin's</HI> Rope and Hair-cloth; could never have been shapen but in the <HI>Conclave of Hell.</HI> This is a <HI>Depth of Satan,</HI> and from <HI>Him</HI> this <HI>Mother of Abomi∣nations</HI> had her Birth. It is of the bottomless <HI>Pit</HI> and going to it.</P>
<P>BUT thou, <HI>O Man of God,</HI> flee these things! Yea hate the <HI>Whore,</HI> and burn the Attire of the Harlot. <HI>Follow after Righteousness, Godliness, Faith, Love, Patience, Meek∣ness.</HI> Study the true Example and Law of <HI>Jesus,</HI> and imitate it, obey it. <HI>He humbled Himself, and took the Form of a Servant.</HI> Be we not called <HI>Masters,</HI> for <HI>one</HI> is our Master in Heaven, even <HI>Christ,</HI> and we are Brethren. Let us not preach <HI>our Selves,</HI> but Christ Jesus the Lord, and our Selves the Servants of all for Jesus sake. Let us remember, that <HI>the Angels of Christ's Little Ones do behold the Face of their Heavenly Father;</HI> And let us de∣sire to be like <HI>those Angels</HI> in our Ministrations to the <HI>least</HI> Soul within our Flocks. Let us <HI>feed Christ's Lambs,</HI> and be ready to <HI>wash one anothers Feet.</HI></P>
<P>LET the <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Evangelical Ministry lay this low and deep and strong Foundation for it, in great Humiliation <HI>before God</HI> for Sin, and in a lowly Heart and Life toward and before <HI>all Men;</HI> That God who resists the Proud and giveth Grace to the Humble, <HI>may count you worthy of his Calling,</HI> and use &amp; honour you among his People.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="003520_0011_0FF855E1111F1E20"/>
YEA-let all of us, who have the Honour to be among the <HI>humble Pastors</HI> of the Flocks of Christ in these Ends of the Earth, fall down before the Lord and his People, and say with the highest Gratitude as <HI>David</HI> did, when God took him from the Sheep-folds to feed Israel his People; <HI>"Who am I O Lord God, and what is my Fa∣thers House! that thou hast brought me hitherto!</HI> It is not because we were better born, nor because we were Sons of brighter Parts, nor because we had better Hearts than Others the Companions of our Childhood, that <HI>we</HI> were selected by Providence, and enter'd into <HI>Collegiate Schools,</HI> and preferr'd to sit at the Feet of some Men of God, <HI>to hold Water to 'em while they wash'd their Hands;</HI> if so be we might receive a Portion of their Spirit and come into their Place. No; how many of us may ra∣ther say in the humble Words of <HI>Amos, "I was no Pro∣phets Son,</HI> but a Trades-man's or <HI>Herds-man</HI>'s; and yet <HI>the Lord took me and said to me, "Go, prophecy to my People.</HI></P>
<P>BUT this on the <HI>Second Doctrine,</HI> That the <HI>best</HI> of Saints and the best of Ministers will be and should be in their own Eyes <HI>less</HI> than the least of all.</P>
<P>SEE then what a glorious Grace this of true <HI>Christian Humility</HI> is, and of what a <HI>sweet Odour</HI> in the House of God. It is <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Aarons</HI> priestly <HI>Garment</HI> for Glory and Beauty, and as the precious <HI>Ointment</HI> for Fragrancy, that ran down to the <HI>Hem</HI> of it. But it is <HI>far</HI> from the Sign and Spirit of a Minister of Christ, to be elated with a Conceit of his own Gifts or Sanctity, and to say unto Others, <HI>"Come not near me, I am holier than thou.</HI></P>
<P>LET the Grace of <HI>Humility,</HI> among other Requisites and Ornaments, recommend a Person to a <HI>People's Choice</HI> into the Pastoral Office over them; that they may find a <HI>Moses</HI> or a <HI>Jeremiah</HI> in the Person called, who <HI>both</HI> an∣swer'd the Divine Call with the most humble &amp; sincere <HI>Excuses, "Lord, who am I? slow of Speech and of a slow Tongue!</HI> and <HI>Lord, I cannot speak for I am a Child!</HI></P>
<P>BUT I come to the <HI>third and last Doctrine,</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. DOCT. <HI>THAT humble Saints, whoever they be, whether Ministers or People, will be greatly affected with the Grace of God to them, That they should have Christ and his unsearchable Riches preached to 'em, or be called them∣selves to</HI> PREACH <HI>Him unto others.</HI> "That to <HI>me</HI> the least of all Saints is <HI>this Grace given.</HI></P>

First then, IT is a great Grace given to the <HI>Ministers</HI> of Christ, that <HI>they</HI> should be called to <HI>preach</HI> Christ and his unsearchable Riches unto <HI>others.</HI> And Secondly, It is in like manner the great Grace and Favour of God to <HI>People</HI> to have Christ and his unsearchable Riches <HI>preached to them.</HI></P>
<P>BY <HI>Grace</HI> here we may understand, 1. The <HI>outward Favour</HI> of God on Spiritual Accounts, and in point of distinguishing Priviledges. And by Grace <HI>given</HI> is meant granted or <HI>shown</HI> to one more than to others who are in as much need of, and as much deserve the same Favour of God. But 2. <HI>Saving Grace</HI> is more especially here meant; for the Grace given to the <HI>Apostle</HI> was special and saving, and so it is to all <HI>Saints;</HI> and <HI>this</HI> it is that makes the <HI>Dispensation of the Gospel,</HI> committed to us, <HI>great and rich Grace</HI> indeed, both to <HI>Ministers &amp; People.</HI></P>
<P>To begin then with the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel, as my <HI>Text</HI> leads me,</P>
<P N="1">I. IT is great Grace given to the <HI>Ministers of the Word,</HI> that <HI>they</HI> should be singled out and called to preach Christ and his unsearchable Riches unto others.</P>
<P>WE need the Heart of an <HI>Apostle</HI> to conceive, and the Tongue of one to speak of this <HI>Grace</HI> of God to sinful Man; and the Tongues of <HI>Angels</HI> would fall short of it.

What Honour and Grace is <HI>this</HI> to some among the sinful Sons of Men.</P>
<P N="1">1. To <HI>preach.</HI> To speak in God's Name, his Words; to declare and publish his Will, his Good-will to Men! To be made His Mouth, as tho' <HI>He</HI> spake! How great a thing is it for One formed out of the <HI>Clay,</HI> and born in <HI>Sin!</HI> Well might a <HI>Moses</HI> plead his Unfitness for such a Work; and his Unworthiness of such a Mission! that he had neither Soul nor Tongue, Head or Heart for such a Ministry. When <HI>Paul</HI> was furnished for it with Gifts, and fortified by Grace, yet he needed a Thorn in the flesh to keep him from being exalted. Nay the <HI>Son of God</HI> himself, the Lord of Glory, speaks of the Fathers Grace to Him, even <HI>to Him,</HI> in his <HI>Anointing him to preach good Tydings to the Meek,</HI> Isai. lxi. 1.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="003520_0013_0FF855E5A4D19150"/>
ONLY let us speak <HI>as the Oracles of God,</HI> the Truth as it is in Jesus, the Doctrine which is according to God∣liness. Let us not preach our Selves, our own Parts and Powers, natural or acquired; Our own Reason or Wit, our Philosophic or Poetic Genius, our own Fancies and Conceits, our Piques and Passions, Spleen and Wraths. But let us consecrate all our Talents and Abilities to the Service of Truth and Grace, to the Honour of Christ and the Good of Souls; preaching the pure Word of God with Plainess and Simplicity, Gravity and Authori∣ty, feeding the Babes with Milk, and the Adult with strong Meat; keeping back nothing that is profitable to Souls, and being earnest and zealous in our Addresses to the Hearts and Consciences of Men.</P>
<P N="2">2. To preach <HI>Christ.</HI> He is the <HI>Subject</HI> of Gospel Preaching, and how great a Grace it is to be accounted, that we may preach <HI>Him?</HI> CHRIST, in his Person, Na∣tures, Offices, Benefits! Christ, in his Eternal God-head, in the Covenant of Redemption and Grace; in the Pro∣mises, Prophecies and Types of Him! In his Birth, Life, Doctrines, Laws, Miracles, Sufferings and Death! In his Resurrection, Ascention to and Session at the right Hand of God; his Intercession and Second Coming to judge the World! In short, <HI>The Covenant of Salvation thro' Him.</HI> — This is a copious and wide Field for Gospel Preaching; and every Doctrine or Law of Natural Re∣ligion with a direct Reference unto <HI>Him;</HI> as revealed "and enjoyned by Him, as performed only by his Grace, and acceptable only for his Sake, <HI>who is the End of the Law for Righteousness;</HI> that as inforc'd upon us by his Promises and Threatnings; yet <HI>He</HI> in all may be glori∣fied, and the Grace of God thro' Him. —So it is noted in the Life of Mr. <HI>Philip Henry,</HI> that whenever he preached of Moral Duties, he would always bring <HI>Christ</HI> into his Sermon, his <HI>Life</HI> as the Pattern of the Duty, his <HI>Love</HI> as the grand Motive to it, his Merits as the great <HI>Atonement</HI> for our Defects in it.— This is primitive and Apostolic Preaching, and may it always be the Manner of our Preaching to You the Gospel of the Grace of God. We wou'd wear this as our <HI>Crown,</HI> and make it our <HI>Tri∣umph:</HI> Rom. i. 15, 16. <HI>For I am not ashamed of the Gos∣pel of Christ; for it is the Power of God to Salvation unto every one that believeth, to the Jew first and also to the Greek: For therein is the Righteousness of God re∣vealed
<PB N="12" REF="003520_0014_0FF855E92FE52F48"/>from Faith to Faith; As it is written, The Just shall live by Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. To preach the <HI>Riches,</HI> the <HI>unsearchable</HI> Riches of Christ! In Him are hid <HI>all the Treasures of Wisdom and Knowledge;</HI> He is the <HI>Pearl of great Price,</HI> and the <HI>Treasure hid in the Field,</HI> for the gaining of which a Man may well sell all that he has. His Fruit is better than <HI>Gold</HI> and his Revenue than choice <HI>Silver;</HI> He makes those that love him to inherit <HI>Substance,</HI> and he will fill their <HI>Treasuries.</HI> We read of the exceeding Riches of his <HI>Grace,</HI> and of the Riches in <HI>Glory</HI> by Jesus Christ. What a <HI>Treasure</HI> is this, put into <HI>earthen Vessels!</HI> for a mortal Man to minister for the inriching Souls in the saving Knowledge of Christ!</P>
<P>WHO can <HI>by Searching</HI> find out the <HI>Mystery of the Fa∣ther and of the Son!</HI> Or what Eye has seen, or Ear heard, or what Tongue can speak the Things which Grace has prepared for those that believe! The SPIRIT <HI>Himself,</HI> who searches the <HI>deep</HI> things of God, seems to <HI>labour</HI> in the speaking of them: Ephes. ii. 18. "<HI>And what is the Riches of the Glory of his Inheritance in the Saints! and what the exceeding Greatness of his Power to us ward that believe! according to the working of his mighty Power, which He wro't in Christ, when he raised Him from the dead,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>ALL the Works of God are <HI>unsearchable,</HI> but most of all that of our Redemption and Salvation. <HI>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wisdom and Knowledge of God,</HI> his Holiness and Grace. Justice and Mercy glorified to∣gether in this Work! <HI>Which thing the Angels of Heaven desire to look into!</HI> They have looked long, with great Desire; intently look'd and learned much; but never have search'd it out, nor ever can; but are still bowing their Faces, with fixed Eyes, upon the <HI>Mercy-Seat.</HI> Unto <HI>Them,</HI> within the Vail, is made known by the Church the <HI>manifold Wisdom of God.</HI><GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, <HI>Multi∣formis Sapientia:</HI> As in the Work of <HI>Creation</HI> there were a <HI>Multitude of Forms,</HI> and all unsearchable; so are there in the Mystery of Grace. Our <HI>Context</HI> calls it <HI>the Mystery,</HI> which <HI>passes Knowledge.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="003520_0015_0FF855EB4ACBA818"/>
To speak only of that which is most <HI>plain</HI> and level to us, The <HI>Benefits</HI> of Christ are his <HI>Riches,</HI> and these are <HI>unsearchable.</HI> O what is the <HI>Price;</HI> what are the <HI>Riches</HI> of Pardon, Grace &amp; Glory, to guilty condemned perishing Souls! Who can search out the immense Ri∣ches of an <HI>Infinite Saviour!</HI> of an <HI>Eternal Salvation!</HI> of <HI>Salvation with Eternal Glory!</HI> It is high as <HI>Heaven,</HI> what canst thou do? and deep as <HI>Hell</HI> what canst thou know? the Knowledge thereof is immeasurable and incompre∣hensible as Eternity, and Infinity!</P>
<P N="4">4. O then the <HI>Grace!</HI> the <HI>great</HI> Grace shewn to <HI>some of us,</HI> the least and sinfullest among the Sons of Men, that <HI>we</HI> should be called to preach <HI>these Riches</HI> of Christ to Immortal, perishing <HI>Souls</HI> for their Salvation! <HI>That I should preach among the Gentiles,</HI> says the <HI>Apostle.</HI> And again, Rom. i. 5 <HI>By whom we have received Grace and Apostleship, for Obedience to the Faith among all Nations. for his Name.</HI></P>
<P>BUT who are <HI>we,</HI> to have any like Honour put on us? Any like Heart and Inclination, Gifts and Graces, from the same <HI>Spirit of Promise,</HI> that came in Tongues of Fire from the Ascended Saviour on the Day of <HI>Pentecost!</HI> That we should be as Successors to <HI>Aaron</HI> and his Sons, to <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias,</HI> to <HI>Apostles, Prophets</HI> &amp; <HI>Evangelists;</HI> not in their Inipiration, and immediate Mission and En∣duing from on High, but in their common Spiritual Mi∣nistry. For it is <HI>the self same Spirit,</HI> in his common Gifts and Operations, <HI>dividing to every Man severally as He will;</HI> and saying to us in his glorious Providence, "<HI>Soparate me this and the other unto the Work whereto I have called them. He</HI> gives us our Dispositions for Study, Promptness to learn, Invention and Judgment, and <HI>the Tongue of the Learned to speak a Word in Season;</HI> to speak with Art and Authority, to inform and affect, to give Light and Heat, to move the Affections and ad∣dress the Conscience, and make Men's Hearts <HI>burn with∣in them.</HI> He gives the holy, humble, serious, fervent Ministerial Spirit, that naturally cares for Souls, and is acted from pure and single Aims at the Glory of God, in our own and their Salvation.</P>
<P>Now that any of <HI>Us</HI> should be among these <HI>Gifts</HI> of God to Men, what a rich and free Act of <HI>Grace</HI> is it?
<PB N="14" REF="003520_0016_0FF855ED80FEB320"/>As <HI>Daniel</HI> said after all his Preparations to stand before the <HI>King,</HI> and that he might be meet for <HI>God</HI> to use and honour him; "<HI>I thank thee and praise thee, O thou God of my Fathers! that hast given me Wisdom.</HI> With like religious Gratitude let us bow down at the Word of God, and run with <HI>Cushi,</HI> to carry good Tydings: If so be we may be made to Souls <HI>Ministers by whom they believe; Workers together with Christ,</HI> active Instruments in the Hand of the <HI>Spirit, Stewards of the Mysteries of God, faithful and wise Servants to give the Houshold their Meat in due season.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT a distinguishing Grace will this be found <HI>in the Day of Christ,</HI> When <HI>they that are wise shall shine as the Firmament, and they that turn many to Righteousness, as the Stars for ever and ever.</HI></P>
<P>O if our Souls were duly affected with the Grace of God to us as <HI>Paul</HI> was, it wou'd bring us into the holy Mini∣stry, and carry us on in it with his gracious Spirit; where∣of we read, Col. i. 25,—29. <HI>Whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God, which is given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God: Even the mystery which hath been hid from ages, and from generations, but now is made manisest to his saints. To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory. Whom we preach, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. Whereunto I also labour, striving accord∣ing to his working, which worketh in me mightily.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I come to say <HI>Secondly,</HI> and so draw to a <HI>Close,</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. IT is in like manner the great <HI>Grace</HI> and Favour of God <HI>to any People,</HI> to have Christ and his unsearcha∣ble Riches <HI>preached to Them.</HI> Ministers and People are at last <HI>One,</HI> and equal in this Grace. <HI>I Paul</HI> the Mini∣ster of Christ <HI>for You</HI> Gentiles. What were <HI>Apostles,</HI> and what are <HI>Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> but <HI>Gifts for Men,</HI> that the LORD GOD may dwell among them. They are or∣dained <HI>for Men,</HI> in things pertaining to God Are they <HI>Ambassadors</HI> from Christ? it is <HI>to beseech You</HI> in his Stead to be reconciled to God. Are they <HI>Servants of the most High God?</HI> it is to <HI>show You</HI> the Way of Salva∣tion.
<PB N="15" REF="003520_0017_0FF855F08C77D948"/>Are they <HI>Workers</HI> together with God? You are God's <HI>Husbandry</HI> and his <HI>Building.</HI> Are they <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gels</HI> of the Churches? it is to minister unto the <HI>Heirs</HI> of Sal∣vation. Are they <HI>Watchman?</HI> it is to watch for <HI>Souls</HI> as those that must give an Account. Is there any <HI>Dispen∣sation</HI> of Grace granted 'em? it is to <HI>You-ward;</HI> to save themselves &amp; those that hear them. Are they <HI>Stewards?</HI> it is for the <HI>Houshold.</HI> And are they <HI>Shepherds,</HI> it is for the <HI>Flock.</HI></P>
<P>THE Grace and Favour in the preached Gospel is therefore the <HI>same</HI> to People and to Ministers. Ministers are given <HI>for the People</HI> and <HI>to</HI> the People; Not <HI>they</HI> formed into Congregations and Churches for the sake of Ministers, 1 Cor. ii. 7. <HI>We preach the Wisdom ordained before the World unto</HI> YOUR <HI>Glory.</HI> 3.5. <HI>Who then is Paul? and who is Apollos? but Ministers by whom</HI> YOU <HI>believe; even as God gives to every Man.</HI> 2 Tim. 2.10. <HI>I endure all things for the Elects sake, that they may ob∣tain the Salvation which is in Jesus Christ, with Eternal Glory.</HI> 2 Cor. vi. 11. <HI>Our Mouth is open to</HI> YOU, <HI>our Heart is enlarged; Be</HI> YE <HI>also enlarged.</HI></P>
<P>THUS Ministers and People are <HI>One</HI> in the Grace of the preached Gospel. The <HI>Hearers</HI> of the Word are therefore to be now invited &amp; admonished to say with∣in Themselves, "That <HI>to us</HI> this Grace is given, to have Christ and his Riches preached <HI>to us!</HI></P>
<P>IT is a <HI>distinguishing Priviledge,</HI> and it should be a <HI>saving Mercy.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. IT is a <HI>distinguishing Grace</HI> of God to any People, and to Persons of whatever Rank &amp; Degree, and they should be greatly <HI>affected</HI> with it. Few, very <HI>few</HI> are so distin∣guished. The Line of <HI>Election</HI> is as it were drawn down to us, in the Mission of the Gospel to us. As God gave to <HI>Abraham</HI> the Promise of the glorious <HI>Seed,</HI> in Whom <HI>all the Families</HI> of the Earth should be blessed; So to <HI>us</HI> he has fulfilled the Promise &amp; revealed the blessed Seed. and set all Spiritual and Eternal Blessings before us thro' Him. The <HI>Covenant</HI> He gave to Abraham, &amp; his <HI>Blessing</HI> is come <HI>to us Gentiles</HI> thro' Faith. We have <HI>Moses</HI> and the <HI>Prophets</HI> read &amp; preached to us every Sabbath-day. We have Moses <HI>unveil'd,</HI> and can look upon the <HI>Lustre</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="003520_0018_0FF812B0597CC7C0"/>of his Face, and see the Glory of <HI>Christ</HI> shining in all the <HI>Types</HI> &amp; Shadows of the Law. We have <HI>Life</HI> &amp; <HI>Death,</HI> the Blessing and the Curse set before us in the clearest Light. We have a <HI>Tribe,</HI> like that of <HI>Levi,</HI> separated to teach us God's Judgments. We have the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> of God in the midst of us, his <HI>Altar</HI> and his <HI>Court.</HI> We have his <HI>Sabbaths</HI> and <HI>Sacraments</HI> We have his more <HI>spiritual</HI> Worship, Statutes and Ordinances. The righ∣teous Men of old desir'd to <HI>see</HI> the Things which <HI>we</HI> see, and to hear the Things which <HI>we</HI> hear They prophe∣sied of the Grace that is come to <HI>us.</HI> God has provided the <HI>better</HI> Things for us, that They without Us should not be made perfect. Unto <HI>us</HI> they did minister the things that are now reported to You, by them that preach the Gospel. Wherefore <HI>gird up</HI> the Loyns of your Mind, and <HI>lift up</HI> your Hearts and Hands in the Sanctu∣ary, for the <HI>Grace</HI> that is brought to You at the Reve∣lation of Jesus Christ.— The Church of old saw <HI>Moses</HI> come down <HI>shining</HI> from the Mount, with the <HI>Tables</HI> in his Hands: But <HI>blessed</HI> are your Eyes and Ears that see and hear <HI>Jesus</HI> as it were preaching to the Multitudes on the Mountain, and <HI>transfigured</HI> in the Mount, with <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Elias</HI> in their Glory waiting on Him.— When <HI>Balaam</HI> prophesied of <HI>Him that should come out of Jacob,</HI> to have the <HI>Dominion,</HI> he concluded thus, "<HI>Who shall live when God doth this?</HI> We can tell him who shall: <HI>We live</HI> when God has done it! And O that it may be <HI>Life Eternal</HI> to us! — But in order to this</P>
<P N="2">2. THIS very distinguishing Grace of God to us <HI>must become saving.</HI> And <HI>wo</HI> to us, if Christ and his unsear∣chable Riches be <HI>preached</HI> to us, and preached by us, and we are <HI>not saved</HI> by it. If we come to plead in Vain, <HI>Lord we have prophesied in thy Name, and thou hast taught in our Streets.</HI> Where and what will the <HI>Grace</HI> and Favour then be to us? It is received in vain, &amp; will but turn to our greater Wretchedness, Misery &amp; Curse. As it is written, <HI>You only have I known of all the Fami∣lies of the Earth, therefore will I punish you from your Iniquities. And thou Capernaum, which art exalted to Hea∣ven shall be bro't down to Hell; For if the mighty Works done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would have repent∣ed and remained. Wherefore it shall be more tolerable in the 'Day of Judgment for Tire and Sidon than for You.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="003520_0019_0FF855F52BCD41C0"/>
LET it be therefore our earnest Care and Prayer that the Word preached be <HI>savingly profitable</HI> to our Souls; that we receive that <HI>special Grace</HI> which the Lord means us from his preached Gospel. It were <HI>below His Grace</HI> to give a revealed <HI>Word,</HI> to institute a <HI>Sabbath,</HI> to ordain a <HI>Ministry,</HI> to appoint <HI>Ordinances,</HI> for any <HI>less</HI> End. He would have us come to the Knowledge of the Truth <HI>and be saved.</HI> He sends his <HI>Ministers</HI> now, as He will his <HI>Angels</HI> hereafter, to <HI>gather in his Elect</HI> from the four Quarters of the Earth. The <HI>Election</HI> will receive his Grace, <HI>ob∣tain</HI> his Mercy, while the rest are <HI>blinded;</HI> blindly re∣ject it. Give your Ministers the <HI>Joy</HI> of saying to You, in the Words of the <HI>Apostle</HI> to the <HI>Thessalonians; "Know∣ing, Brethren beloved, your Election of God! For our Gos∣pel came not to You in Word only, but in the Power of the</HI> HOLY GHOST.</P>
<P>THIS, <HI>this</HI> is <HI>saving</HI> Grace and Mercy! what <HI>Sinners</HI> should seek, and what <HI>Saints</HI> may triumph in! what <HI>Mi∣nisters</HI> should preach, and <HI>People</HI> hear for. Else <HI>what go ye forth to see? A Reed shaken with the Wind!</HI> Or what go ye forth to <HI>hear? The Songs of Children in the Market,</HI> in their idle Plays! For can any thing answer to the Incarnation, Dying and Resurrection of the <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> but the <HI>Eternal Salvation of your precious Souls</HI> from Sin and Death and Hell? Or can the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> be given from on High, but for the <HI>piercing</HI> Sinners to the Heart, and to set them a crying out, <HI>Sirs, What must we do to be saved!</HI> For what a <HI>Farce</HI> is this Solemnity of a preach∣ed <HI>Christ</HI> and his unsearchable <HI>Riches</HI> turned into, if it have <HI>no Effect</HI> upon the Hearts &amp; Lives of Men? if it effect no change of Souls here, nor turn to their Salva∣tion in the Life to come? Let us throw up our <HI>Sabbaths,</HI> and cast away our <HI>Bibles,</HI> and lay aside the Order and Work of a <HI>Ministry;</HI> if they be not for the <HI>Conversion of Souls.</HI> But if <HI>this</HI> be the End and Fruit of a preached JESUS, how glorious is it and worthy of his blessed Name! whose Glory is infinite &amp; eternal in our Salvation.</P>
<P>READ then <HI>the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ</HI> to us in his preached Gospel, and let it animate both Ministers and People, as it inspired holy <HI>Paul; "If by any Means I may save some! "I please all Men in all things, seck∣ing their spiritual Profit that they may be saved! "Whe∣ther we be afflicted or comforted, it is for your Consolation
<PB N="18" REF="003520_0020_0FF855F8C0B267E0"/>and Salvation! "Men &amp; Brethren, Unto You is this Word of Salvation sent! "to You is preached the Forgiveness of Sins! "judge not your Selves unworthy of eternal Life! "For there is Salvation in no other.</HI></P>
<P>I have thus endeavoured in as few &amp; strong Words as I could to represent to You, the <HI>Grace given us</HI> in the Gospel preached to us. And what are <HI>we</HI> in this wide and wild World, that to <HI>Us</HI> this <HI>distinguishing,</HI> and (if it be not our own Fault) this <HI>saving</HI> Grace of God should be given and not to Others! or to <HI>Us</HI> more and in a better Manner than to many Others!</P>
<P>LET <HI>Ministers</HI> Examine and judge themselves before the Lord and his People: "How are <HI>we affected</HI> with the Grace of God to us, in his All-disposing Providence respecting Us, putting us into the Ministry! chusing for us our Lot &amp; Station! giving us an early serious &amp; humble Mind for the great Work it self, and furnishing us in any measure for our Places! granting us any Tokens of his Presence with us in our Ministrations to the Souls of our respective Flocks! any Seals of our Ministry, and Hopes of Glory with them at the Appearance of JESUS CHRIST! How do we, and how have we preached CHRIST &amp; his Riches to our People! and to what Effect on our own and their Souls together!</P>
<P>LET <HI>Candidates</HI> for the Ministry learn with what Tem∣per &amp; Exercise of Soul, with what kind of Affections, they should prepare for &amp; enter on it: beginning as they pur∣pose (by the Grace of God) to hold on, <HI>preaching Christ and his unsearchable Riches</HI> unto Souls ready to perish; that the <HI>Spirit</HI> of Christ and his <HI>Glory</HI> may rest on 'em and shine in 'em, and be the <HI>Alpha &amp; Omega, the first and the last</HI> with them, in their holy Studies and public Per∣formances.</P>
<P>LET them learn of <HI>blessed Paul</HI> how &amp; what to <HI>preach,</HI> and with what Aims at the Conversion and Salvation of Souls: And therefore let them look unto their <HI>own</HI> Souls first, &amp; give Diligence to make their own Effectual Cal∣ling sure: That they may be able to use such Words as these, <HI>"When it pleased God to call me by his Grace, and reveal his Son in me; that I should preach Him unto Others.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="003520_0021_0FF855FA461B4738"/>
LET 'em give no Occasion to the Ministers &amp; Churches from their public Discourses to fear or say, That they are going off to <HI>another</HI> Kind &amp; Way of Preaching, and that the serious humble and earnest Preaching of <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>his Riches,</HI> for the Salvation of lost Souls, is not the plain Aim and Scope of their Ministry. And if it be not let 'em know, that the End of the Ministry is not like to be reach'd by Them, either as to Themselves or those that hear them.</P>
<P>I turn me now to the <HI>Honoured Congregation and Flock of Christ,</HI> who have called us this Day to <HI>pray</HI> with Them and <HI>preach</HI> to 'em, that God may graciously <HI>direct</HI> Them in their <HI>Election</HI> of Another into the <HI>Pastoral Office</HI> over Them.</P>
<P>WE would have You <HI>greatly affected</HI> (you see) with <HI>the Grace of God</HI> to You, in that You have had <HI>Christ and his Riches</HI> preached to You, from your Beginning unto this Day.

<P>YOU will doubtless desire <HI>the same Kind and Way of Preaching</HI> to be continued among You, &amp; to your Chil∣dren after You. And may it ever be so. Therefore |take this general Direction in the Choice before You, "Chuse <HI>Him,</HI> of Whom (after serious Seeking to God) You in your Consciences think, will most and best labour, with Affection and Joy, to preach <HI>Christ and his unsearchable Riches</HI> to You.</P>
<P>AND the Lord direct Your Hearts into such a Choice, of a <HI>Pastor after his Own Heart!</HI></P>

I conclude with those Words, from which your <HI>Aged venerable Pastor</HI> preached to the Church and Congrega∣tion to Whom I minister, <HI>two and thirty Years ago,</HI> Heb. xii. 14. <HI>Follow Peace with all Men, and Holiness with∣out which no Man shall see the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>I think that <HI>Truth, Peace</HI> &amp; <HI>Holiness</HI> have flourished together in <HI>this Church</HI> &amp; Congregation from their Be∣ginning. A most distinguishing Grace and Favour to it. May <HI>they</HI> still flourish among You! They hang one up∣on another as Links in a <HI>Chain</HI> of Gold. Let not the Chain be broken, but still worn on your Hearts &amp; about your Necks. I trust it is like to be so, however Provi∣dence shall direct your Choice. And consequently that You must see it to be your Duty (every One of You) to acquiesce &amp; unite in its Determination, and to continue together, waiting on God, under the Ministry of the Person that shall be chosen, till You see <HI>these Great Ends of the Gospel</HI> failing among You thro' his Deficiency: Which God forbid.</P>
<P>I conclude with that <HI>Apostolical Benediction,</HI> Ephes. vi. 23. <HI>Peace be to the Brethren, &amp; Love with Faith from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
