<L>'Twas early day, as poets say,</L>

<LG>
<L>As in a maze, he stood to gaze,</L>
<L>The truth can't be denied, sir,</L>

<HEAD>LIBERTY TREE.</HEAD>
<P>Written at the commencement of the American war.</P>
<LG>
<L>IN a chariot of light, from the regions of day,</L>
<L>The Goddess of Liberty came,</L>
<L>Ten thousand celestials directed her way,</L>
<L>And hither conducted the dame:</L>
<L>The fair budding branch from the gardens above,</L>
<L>Where millions with millions agree,</L>
<L>She brought in her hand, as a pledge of her love,</L>
<L>And the plant she nam'd Liberty Tree.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The celelestial exotic sunk deep in the ground,</L>
<L>Like a native he flourish'd and bore,</L>
<L>The fame of its fruit drew the nations around</L>
<L>For to seek out this peaceable shore.</L>
<L>Unmindful of name or distinction they came,</L>
<L>Like freemen and brothers agree,</L>
<L>With one spirit endu'd they one friendship pursu'd,</L>
<L>And their temple was Liberty Tree.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Beneath this fair branch, like the patriots of old,</L>
<L>Our bread in contentment we eat,</L>
<L>Unperplex'd with thots of silver or gold,</L>
<L>The cares of the wealthy or great.</L>
<L>With timber and tar we old England supply'd,</L>
<L>Supported her pow'r on the sea;</L>
<L>Her battles we fought without gaining a groat,</L>
<L>For the safety of Liberty Tree.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But list, O ye swains! tis a tale most profane,</L>
<L>That all these tyranical pow'rs,</L>
<L>Kings, Commons, and Lords, all unite in a name,</L>
<L>To cut down this garden of ours.</L>

<L>Cease, cease, thou cruel ocean,</L>

<L>All melancholy lying,</L>

<L>Repaid each blast with sighing,</L>
<L>Each billow with a tear:</L>

<HEAD>THE DEATH OF GENERAL WOLFE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>IN a mouldring cave, where the wretched retreat,</L>
<L>Britannia sat wested with care;</L>
<L>She wept for her WOLFE, then exclaim'd against fate;</L>
<L>And gave herself up to dispair,</L>
<L>The walls of her cell were insculptur'd around</L>
<L>With the exploits of her favorite sun;</L>
<L>And even the dust as it lay on the ground,</L>
<L>Was engrav'd with the deeds he had done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The Sire of the gods, from his chrystiline throne,</L>
<L>Beheld this disconsolate dame;</L>
<L>And mov'd with her fate he sent Mercury down,</L>
<L>And these were the tidings that came.</L>
<L>Britannia forbear, not a sigh, nor a tear,</L>
<L>For thy Wolfe so deser vedly lov'd,</L>
<L>Your grief shall be chang'd into triumph of joy,</L>
<L>For thy Wolfe is not dead, but remov'd.</L>
</LG>

<L>The sons of the earth, the proud giants of old</L>
<L>Have broke from their darksome abodes.</L>

And such is the news as in heaven it is told,</L>
<L>They are marching to war with the gods;</L>
<L>A council was held in the chamber of Jove,</L>
<L>Where they came to this final decree,</L>
<L>That Wolfe should be call'd to the armies above.</L>
<L>And the charge was intrusted to me.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To the plains of Quebec with these orders I flew,</L>
<L>He beg'd for a moment's delay,</L>
<L>He cry'd, Oh! forbear, let me victory hear,</L>
<L>And then thy commands I'll obey;</L>
<L>With a dark'ning film I encompass'd his eyes,</L>
<L>And convey'd him away in an urn;</L>
<L>Lest the fondness he bore for his own native shore</L>
<L>Should persuade him again to return.</L>
