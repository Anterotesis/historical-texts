<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WHEN MAN came first out of the Hands of the great CREATOR, cloath'd in Bod<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as well as in Soul, with Immortality and Inco<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ruption, there was no Place for Physick, or t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Art of Healing. As he knew no Sin, so h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> knew no Pain, no Sickness, Weakness, or bodily Disorder. The Habitation wherein the angelick Mind, the <HI>Divinae Particula Aurae</HI> abode, altho' originally formed out of the Dust of the Earth, was liable to no Decay. It had no Seeds of Cor∣ruption or Dissolution within itself. And there was nothing without to injure it: Heaven and Earth, and all the Hosts of them, were mild, benign and friendly to human Nature. The en∣tire Creation was at Peace with Man, so long as Man was at Peace with his Creator. So that well might the Morning Stars sing together, and all the Sons of GOD shout for Joy.</P>
<P N="2">2. But since Man rebell'd against the Sove∣reign of Heaven and Earth, how entirely is the Scene changed? The incorruptible Frame hath put on Corruption, the Immortal has put on Mor∣tality. The Seeds of Weakness and Pain, of Sickness and Death, are now lodged in our in∣most Substance: Whence a thousand Disorders
<PB N="iv" REF="009867_0004_0F7B33110C3CB0C0"/>
continually spring, even without the Aid of ex∣ternal Violence. And how is the Number of these increased, by every Thing round about us? The Heavens, the Earth, and all Things con∣tained therein, conspire to punish the Rebels a∣gainst their Creator. The Sun and Moon shed unwholsome Influences from above; the Earth exhales poisonous Damps from beneath: The Beasts of the Field, the Birds of the Air, the Fishes of the Sea, are in a State of Hostility: The Air itself, that surrounds us on every Side, is replete with the Shafts of Death: Yea, the Food we eat, daily saps the Foundation of the Life, which cannot be sustained without it. So has the LORD of All secured the Execution of his Decree, <Q>Dust thou art, and unto Dust shalt thou return.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. But can there Nothing be found to lessen those Inconveniencies, which cannot be wholly removed? To soften the Evils of Life, and pre∣vent in Part the Sickness and Pain to which we are continually exposed? Without Question there may. One grand Preventive of Pain and Sick∣ness of various Kinds, seems intimated by the great Author of Nature, in the very Sentence that intails Death upon us: <HI>"In the Sweat of thy Face shalt thou eat Bread, 'til thou return to the Ground."</HI> The Power of Exercise, both to preserve and restore Health, is greater than can well be conceived: Especially in those who add Tempe∣rance thereto; who, if they do not confine them∣selves altogether to eat either <Q>Bread, or the
<PB N="v" REF="009867_0005_0F7B3312308FCEF8"/>
Herb of the Field,</Q> (which GOD does not re∣quire them to do) yet steadily observe both that Kind and Measure of Food. which Experience shews to be most friendly to Health and Strength.</P>
<P N="4">4. 'Tis probable PHYSICK, as well as RELIGI∣ON, was in the first Ages chiefly traditional: Every Father delivering down to his Sons, what he had himself in like Manner received, concerning the Manner of healing both outward Hurts, and the Diseases incident to each Climate, and the Me∣dicines which were of the greatest Efficacy for the Cure of each Disorder. 'Tis certain, this is the Method wherein the Art of Healing is preserved among the <HI>Americans,</HI> to this Day. Their Dis∣eases, indeed, are exceeding few; nor do they often occur, by Reason of their continual Exer∣cise, and ('til of late, universal) Temperance. But if any is sick, or bit by a Serpent, or torn by a wild Beast, the Fathers immediately tell their Children what Remedy to apply. And 'tis rare, that the Patient suffers long; those Medicines be∣ing quick, as well as generally infaliible.</P>
<P N="5">5. Hence perhaps it was that the Antients, not only of <HI>Greece</HI> and <HI>Rome,</HI> but even of barba∣rous Nations, usually assign'd Physick a Divine Original. And indeed it was a natural Thought, That He who had taught it to the very Beasts and Birds, the <HI>Cretan</HI> Stag, the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Ibis, could not be wanting to teach Man;
<Q>Sanctius his Animal, mentisque capacius altae:</Q>
Yea, sometimes, even by those meaner Crea∣tures:
<PB N="vi" REF="009867_0006_0F7B33129C384DE0"/>
For it was easy to infer, "If this will heal that Creature, whose Flesh is nearly of the same Texture with mine, then in a parallel Case it will heal me." The Trial was made. The Cure was wrought. And Experience and Phy∣sick grew up together.</P>
<P N="6">6. And has not the Author of Nature taught us the Use of many other Medicines, but what is vulgarly term'd Accident? Thus one walking some Years since in a Grove of Pines, at a Time when many in the neighbouring Town were af∣flicted with a Kind of new Distemper, little Sores in the Inside of the Mouth, a Drop of na∣tural Gum fell from one of the Trees on the Book which he was reading. This he took up, and thoughtlesly applied to one of those sore Pla∣ces. Finding the Pain immediately cease, he applied it to another, which was also presently healed. The same Remedy he afterwards im∣parted to others, and it did not fail to heal any that applied it. And doubtless numberless Re∣medies have been thus casually discovered in eve∣ry Age and Nation.</P>
<P N="7">7. Thus far Physick was wholly founded on Experiment. The <HI>European,</HI> as well as the <HI>Ame∣rican,</HI> said to his Neighbour, Are you sick? Drink the Juice of this Herb, and your Sickness will be at an End. Are you in a burning Heat? Leap into that River, and then sweat 'til you are well. Has the Snake bitten you? Chew, and apply that Root, and the Poison will not hurt you. Thus antient Men, having a little Expe∣rience,
<PB N="vii" REF="009867_0007_0F7B33157B251918"/>
joined with common Sense, and common Humanity, cured both themselves and their Neighbours, of most of the Distempers to which every Nation was subject.</P>
<P N="8">8. But in Process of Time, Men of a philo∣sophical Turn were not satisfied with this. They began to enquire, How they might account for these Things? How such Medicines wrought such Effects? They examined the human Body, and all its Parts; the Nature of the Flesh, Veins, Arteries, Nerves; the Structure of the Brain, Heart, Lungs, Stomach, Bowels; with the Springs of the several Animal Functions. They explored the several Kinds of Animal and Mine∣ral, as well as Vegetable Substances. And hence the whole Order of Physick which had obtained to that Time, came gradually to be inverted. Men of Learning began to set Experience aside; to build Physick upon Hypothesis; to form Theories of Diseases and their Cure, and to sub∣stitute these in the Place of Experiments.</P>
<P N="9">9. As Theories increased, simple Medicines were more and more disregarded and disused: 'til, in a Course of Years, the greater Part of them were forgotten, at least in the politer Na∣tions. In the Room of these, Abundance of new Ones were introduced, by reasoning, speculative Men; and those more and more difficult to be applied, as being more remote from common Observation. Hence Rules for the Application of these, and Medical Books, were immensely mul∣tiplied; 'til at length Physick became an abstruse Science, quite out of the Reach of ordinary Men.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="viii" REF="009867_0008_0F7B331611AB8388"/>10. Physicians now began to be had in Admi∣ration, as Persons who were something more than human. And Profit attended their Em∣ploy, as well as Honour; so that they had now two weighty Reasons for keeping the Bulk of Mankind at a Distance, that they might not pry into the Mysteries of the Profession. To this End they increased those Difficulties by Design, which began in a Manner by Accident. They filled their Writings with Abundance of Technical Terms, utterly unintelligible to plain Men. They affected to deliver their Rules, and to rea∣son upon them, in an abstruse and philosophical Manner. They represented the critical Know∣ledge of Anatomy, Natural Philosophy, (and what not? Some of them insisting on that of A∣stronomy and Astrology too) as necessarily pre∣vious to the understanding the Art of Healing. Those who understood only, How to restore the Sick to Health, they branded with the Name of Empiricks. They introduced into Practice, A∣bundance of compound Medicines, consisting of so many Ingredients, that it was scarce possible for common People to know which it was that wrought a Cure: Abundance of Exoticks, nei∣ther the Nature nor Names of which their own Countrymen understood: Of Chymicals, such as they neither had Skill, nor Fortune, nor Time, to prepare: Yea, and of dangerous Ones, such as they could not use without hazarding Life, but by the Advice of a Physician. And thus both their Honour and Gain were secured; a vast
<PB N="ix" REF="009867_0009_0F7B33171B9F9820"/>
Majority of Mankind being utterly cut off from helping either themselves or their Neighbours, or once daring to attempt it.</P>
<P N="11">11. Yet there have not been wanting from Time to Time, some Lovers of Mankind, who have endeavoured (even contrary to their own Interest) to reduce Physick to its antient Stand∣dard: Who have laboured to explode out of it all Hypotheses, and fine-spun Theories, and to make it a plain intelligible Thing, as it was in the Beginning; having no more Mystery in it than this, "Such a Medicine removes such a Pain." These have demonstrably shewn, That neither the Knowledge of Astrology, Astronomy, Natural Philosophy, nor even Anatomy itself, is absolutely necessary to the quick and effectual Cure of most Diseases incident to human Bodies: Nor yet any Chymical, or Exotick, or Compound Medicine, but a single Plant or Fruit duly appli∣ed. So that every Man of common Sense (unless in some rare Cases) may prescribe either to him∣self or his Neighbour; and may be very secure from doing Harm, even where he can do no Good.</P>
<P N="12">12. Even to the last Age there was something of this Kind done, particularly by the great and good Dr. <HI>Sydenham:</HI> And in the present, by his Pupil Dr. <HI>Dover,</HI> who has pointed out simple Medicines for many Diseases. And some such may be found in the Writings of the learned and ingenious Dr. <HI>Cheyne:</HI> Who doubtless would have communicated many more to the World,
<PB N="x" REF="009867_0010_0F7B3317D2BA99F8"/>
but for the melancholy Reason he gave one of his Friends, that prest him with some Passages in his Works, which too much countenanced the modern Practice, "O Sir, We must do some∣thing to oblige the Faculty, or they will tear us in Pieces."</P>
<P N="13">13. Without any Regard to this, without any Concern about the obliging or disobliging any Man living, a mean Hand has made here some little Attempt toward a plain and easy Way of curing most Diseases. I have only consulted herein, Experience, common Sense, and the common Interest of Mankind. And supposing they can be cured this easy Way, who would de∣sire to use any other? Who would not wish to have a Physician always in his House, and one that attends without Fee or Reward? To be able (unless in some few complicated Cases) to pre∣scribe to his Family, as well as himself?</P>
<P N="14">14. If it be said, But what Need is there of such an Attempt? I answer, The greatest that can possibly be conceived. Is it not needful in the highest Degree, to rescue Men from the Jaws of Destruction? From wasting their For∣tunes, as Thousands have done, and continue to do daily▪ From pining away in Sickness and Pain, either through the Ignorance or Knavery of Physicians? Yea, and many Times throwing away their Lives, after their Health, and Time, and Substance?</P>
<P>Is it enquired, But are there not Books enough already, on every Part of the Art of Medicine?
<PB N="xi" REF="009867_0011_0F7B331887B81AD0"/>
Yes, too many, ten Times over, considering how little to the Purpose the far greater Part of them speak. But beside this, they are too dear for poor Men to buy, and too hard for plain Men to understand. Do you say, But there are e∣nough of these Collections of Receipts. Where? I have not seen One yet, either in our own or a∣ny other Tongue, which contains only safe and cheap and easy Medicines. In all that have yet fallen into my Hands, I find many dear and ma∣ny far-fetch'd Medicines; many of of so dange∣rous a Kind, as a prudent Man would never meddle with. And against the greater Part of those Medicines there is a further Objection: They consist of too many Ingredients. The com∣mon Method of compounding and decompoun∣ding Medicines, can never be reconciled to com∣mon Sense. Experience shews, That one Thing will cure most Disorders, at least as well as twen∣ty put together. Then why do you add the other nineteen? Only to swell the Apothecary's Bill: Nay, possible, on purpose to prolong the Dis∣temper, that the Doctor and he may divide the Spoil</P>
<P>But admitting there is some Quality in the Medicine proposed, which has Need to be cor∣rected: Will not one Thing correct it, as well as twenty? It is probable, much better. And if not, there is Sufficiency of other. Medicines, which need no such Correction.</P>
<P>How often, by thus compounding Medicines of opposite Qualities, is the Virtue of both utter∣ly
<PB N="xii" REF="009867_0012_0F7B331948B8F4B8"/>
destroyed? Nay, how often do those joined to∣gether destroy Life, which single might have preserved it? This occasioned that Caution of the great <HI>Boerhaave,</HI> against mixing Things without evident Necessity, and without full Proof of the Effect they will produce when joined together, as well as of that they produced when asunder: See∣ing (as he observes) several Things, which sepa∣rately taken, are safe and powerful Medicines, when compounded not only lose their former Pow¦ers, but commence a strong and deadly Poison.</P>
<P N="15">15. As to the Manner of using the Medicines here set down, I should advise as soon as you know your Distemper, (which is very easy, unless in a Complication of Disorders, and then you would do well to apply to a Physician that fears GOD) First, use the first of the Remedies for that Dis∣ease which occurs in the ensuing Collection; un∣less some other of them be easier to be had, and then it may do just as well.) Secondly, After a competent Time, if it takes no Effect, use the se∣cond, the third, and so on. I have purposely set down (in most Cases) several Remedies for each Disorder; not only because All are not equally easy to be procured at all Times and in all Places: But likewise because the Medicine which cures one Man, will not always cure ano∣ther of the same Distemper. Nor will it cure the same Man at all Times. Therefore it was neces∣sary to have a Variety. However, I have sub∣join'd the Letter <HI>I</HI> to those Medicines, which are said to be infallible.—Thirdly, Observe all the
<PB N="xiii" REF="009867_0013_0F7B331AF90AC0B0"/>
Time the greatest Exactness in your Regimen, or manner of Living. Abstain from all mixt, or all high season'd Food. Use plain Diet, easy of Digestion: And this as sparingly as you can, con∣sistent with Ease and Strength. Drink only Wa∣ter, if it agrees with your Stomach; if not, good clear Small-beer. Use as much Exercise daily, in the open Air, as you can without Weariness. Sup at Six or Seven on the lightest Food: Go to Bed early, and rise betimes, To persevere with Steadiness in this Course, is often more than half the Cure. Above all, add to the rest, (for it is not Labour lost) that old, unfashionable Medi∣cine, PRAYER. And have Faith in GOD, who <HI>"killeth and maketh alive, who bringeth down to the Grave and bringeth up."</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. For the Sake of those who desire, through the Blessing of GOD, to retain the Health which they have recovered, I have added a few plain easy Rules, chiefly transcribed from Dr. <HI>Cheyne.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. 1. The Air we breathe is of great Conse∣quence to our Health. Those who have been long abroad in Easterly or Northerly Winds, should drink some thin and warm Liquor going to Bed: or a Draught of Toast and Water.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tender People should have those who lie with them or are much about them, sound, sweet and healthy.</P>
<P N="3">3. Every one that would preserve Health, should be as clean and sweet as possible in their Houses, Cloaths, and Furniture.</P>
<P N="2">II. 1. The great Rule of Eating and Drinking is,
<PB N="xiv" REF="009867_0014_0F7B331B878483C8"/>
To suit the Quality and Quantity of Food to the Strength of our Degestion; to take always such a Sort and such a Measure of Food, as sits light and easy on the Stomach.</P>
<P N="2">2. All pickled, or smoaked, or salted Food, and all high-season'd is unwholsome.</P>
<P N="3">3. Nothing conduces more to Health, than Abstinence and plain Food, with due Labour.</P>
<P N="4">4. For studious Persons, about eight Ounces of Animal Food, and twelve of Vegetable in twenty-four Hours is sufficient.</P>
<P N="5">5. Water is the wholsomest of all Drinks; quickens the Appetite and strengthens the Di∣gestion most.</P>
<P N="6">6. Strong, and more especially spirituous Li∣quors, are a certain though slow Poison.</P>
<P N="7">7. Experience shews, there is no Manner of Danger, in leaving them off all at once.</P>
<P N="8">8. Strong Liquors do not prevent the Mis∣chiefs of a Surfeit, nor carry it off so safely as Water.</P>
<P N="9">9. Malt Liquors (except clear Small bear of a due Age) are exceeding hurtful to tender Persons.</P>
<P N="10">10. Coffee and Tea are extremely hurtful to Persons who have weak Nerves.</P>
<P N="3">III. 1. Tender Persons should eat very light Suppers; and that two or three Hours before going to Bed.</P>
<P N="2">2. They ought constantly to go to Bed a∣bout Nine, and rise at Four or Five.</P>
<P N="4">IV. 1. A due Degree of Exercise is indis∣pensably
<PB N="xv" REF="009867_0015_0F7B331E948C5488"/>
necessary to Health and long Life.</P>
<P N="2">2. Walking is the best Exercise for those who are able to bear it. Riding for those who are not. The open Air, when the Weather is fair, contributes much to the Benefit of Exercise.</P>
<P N="3">3. We may strengthen any weak Part of the Body by constant Exercise. Thus the Lungs may be strengthened by loud speaking, or wal∣king up an easy Ascent. The Arms or Hams by strongly rubbing them daily.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Studious ought to have stated Times for Exercise, at least two or three Hours a Day: The one half of this before Dinner, the other before going to Bed.</P>
<P N="5">5. They should frequently shave, and fre∣quently wash their Feet.</P>
<P N="6">6. Those who read or write much, should learn to do it standing; otherwise it will impare their Health.</P>
<P N="7">7. The fewer Cloaths any one uses, by Day or Night, the hardier he will be.</P>
<P N="8">8. Exercise, first, should be always on an emp∣ty Stomach; secondly, should never be continu∣ed to Weariness; thirdly, after it, we should take Care to cool by Degrees. Otherwise we shall catch Cold.</P>
<P N="9">9. The Flesh-brush is a most useful Exercise especially to strengthen any Part that is weak.</P>
<P N="10">10. Cold-bathings is a great Advantage to Health. It prevents Abundance of Diseases. It promotes Perspiration, helps the Circulation of the Blood, and prevents the Danger of catch∣ing
<PB N="xvi" REF="009867_0016_0F7B331F5FFF73B8"/>
Cold. Tender People should pour Water upon the Head before they go in, and walk in, swiftly. To jump in with the Head foremost, is too great a Shock to Nature.</P>
<P N="5">V. 1. Costiveness cannot long consist with Health. Therefore Care should be taken to re∣move it at the Begining; and when it is remo∣ved, to prevent its Return, by soft, cool, open∣ing Diet.</P>
<P N="2">2. Obstructed Perspiration (vulgarly called catching Cold) is one great Source of Diseases. Whenever there appears the least Sign of this let it be removed by gentle Sweats.</P>
<P N="6">VI. 1. The Passions have a greater Influence on Health than most People are aware of.</P>
<P N="2">2. All violent and sudden Passions dispose to, or actually throw People into acute Diseases.</P>
<P N="3">3. The slow and lasting Passions, such as Grief and hopeless Love, bring on chronical Diseases.</P>
<P N="4">4. 'Till the Passion which caused the Disease is calm'd, Medicine is applied in vain.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Love of GOD, as it is the sovereign Remedy of all Miseries, so in particular it effec∣tually prevents all the bodily Disorders the Pas∣sions introduce, by keeping the Passions them∣selves within due Bounds. And by the unspea∣kable Joy and perfect Calm, Serenity and Tran∣quillity it gives the Mind, it becomes the most powerful of all the Means of Health and long Life.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<P N="1"><HI>1.</HI> IT was a great Surprise to the Editor of the following Collection, that there was so swift and large a Demand for it; that nine Impressions were called for in four or five Years; and that it was not only republished by the Booksellers in a neighbouring Nation, but also inserted by Parts in their public Papers, and so propagated through the whole Kingdom. This encouraged him carefully to revise the whole, and to publish it again, with several Alterations, which it is hoped may make it of greater Use to those who love common Sense and common Honesty.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>2.</HI> Those Alterations are still in Pursuance of my first Design, To set down cheap, and safe, and easy Medicines; easy to be known, easy to be procured, and easy to be applied by plain unlettered Men. Ac∣cordingly, I have ommitted a considerable Number which, tho' cheap and safe, were not so common or well known; and have added almost an equal Num∣ber, to which that Objection cannot be made: which are not only of small Price, and extreamly safe, but likewise easily to be found, if not in every House or Yard, yet in every Town, and almost every Village throughout the Kingdom.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>3.</HI> It is because they are not safe, but extremely dangerous, that I have omitted (together with An∣timony) the four <HI>Herculean</HI> Medicines, Opium, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Except in One Instance.</NOTE> the Bark,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Except in One Instance.</NOTE> Steel, and the various Preparations of

Quicksilver. <HI>Herculean</HI> indeed! Far too strong for common Men to grapple with. How many fatal Effects have these produced, even in the Hands of no ordinary Physicians? With regard to four of these, the Instances are glaring and undeniable. And where∣as Quicksilver, the fifth, is in its native Form, as innocent as Bread or Water, has not the Art been discov<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>'d, so to <HI>prepare</HI> it, as to make it the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>dly of all Poisons? These Physicians have just∣ly termed <HI>edged</HI> Tools. But they have not yet taught them to wound at a Distance: And honest Men are under no Necessity of touching them, or coming within their Reach.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>4.</HI> Instead of these, I have once more ventured to recommend to Men of plain unbiassed Reason, such Remedies as Air, Water, Milk, Whey, Ho∣ney, Treacle, Salt, Vinegar, and common <HI>English</HI> Herbs, with a few foreign Medicines, almost equal∣ly cheap, safe and common. And this I have done on that Principle, whereby I desire to be governed in all my Actions, <HI>"Whatsoever ye would that Men should do unto you the same do unto them."</HI></P>
<P N="5"><HI>5.</HI> At the Request of many Persons, I have like∣wise added plain Definitions of most Distempers; not indeed accurate or philosophical Difinitions, but such as are suited to Men of ordinary Capacities, and as may just enable them, in common, simple Cases, to distinguish one Disease from another. In uncommon or complicated Diseases, or where Life is more im∣mediately in Danger I again advise every Man, with out Delay, to apply to a Physician that fears <HI>GOD▪</HI></P>

<P N="482">482. Are of two Kinds; 1. Those which proceed from the Nerves being compress'd by the Swelling of the muscular Flesh: Or, 2. When the Nerves themselves are disorder'd In the former Case, Temperance and Abstemiousness will generally cure: In the latter, when the Nerves perform their Office too languidly, a GOOD AIR is the first requisite. The Patient also should rise early, and as soon as the Dew is off the Ground, walk: Let his Breakfast be <HI>Mother of Thyme-Tea,</HI> gather'd in <HI>June,</HI> using half as much as we do of com∣mon Tea. It should be drunk with the finest Sugar; and Cream may be added if he please: Coffee must be avoided. When the Nerves are too sensible, let the Person breathe a proper Air. Let him eat Veal, Chickens, or Mutton. Ve∣getables should be eat sparingly; the most innocent is the French Bean whilst young, and the best Root the Turnip. Wine should be avoided carefully: So should all Sauces. Sometimes he may breakfast upon a Quarter of an Ounce of the Powder of <HI>Valerian-root</HI> infus'd in hot Water, to which he may add Cream and Sugar. Tea is not proper. When the Person finds an uncommon Oppression, let him take a large Spoonful of the Tincture of <HI>Valerian-root.</HI></P>
<P>The Tincture should be made thus. Cut to Pieces six Ounces of wild <HI>Valerian-root</HI> gather'd in <HI>June,</HI> and fresh dried. Bruise it by a few strokes in a Mortar, that the Pieces may be split, but it should not be beat into a Powder: Put this into a Quart of strong white Wine; cork the Bottle and let it stand three Weeks, shaking it every Day; then press it out and filtre the Tincture thro' Paper.</P>
<P N="483">483. Take also as much as will lie on a Shilling of the Powder of <HI>Misleto,</HI> twice a Day, when the Stomach is most empty, fasting two Hours after it; then once a Day, and afterwards every other, or every third Day, 'till there is no more Need of Medicines.</P>
