<HEAD>A VINDICATION OF THE <HI>Appendix</HI> to the <HI>Sober Remarks.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU cannot easily imagine what a grateful En∣tertainment I always have, when any Lines come to me from <HI>your</HI> obliging Hand. I am particularly bound to thank you for your <HI>last</HI> very acceptable Letter; which was the more welcome, for the kind <HI>Presents</HI> that accompany'd it. The <HI>Defence of the Modest Proof,</HI> which you sent me, appears in <HI>my</HI> Eyes, as you say it does in yours, A Peece of so singular a Complexion and Make (surely perfect in its kind) that I know not how to model my Countenance when I read it, whether for Laughter, for Indignation, or Com∣passion. An extraordinary BOOK it is, as well for the Stile and Method, as for the peculiar Vein of Argument running through the Body of the Work; and must needs therefore make a very admirable Appearance on the Stage of Literature. Undoubtedly the <HI>Author</HI> is some mighty Chief; some great Master at the Art of Wrangling, and us'd to throw the Ball of Contention; a Man fit to be the <HI>Champion</HI> of so distinguish'd a Party, and doubtless the most accomplish'd Hand they could pick out to under∣take
<PB N="2" REF="002636_0004_0FE5D74E6520BED8"/>
the Rescue of their <HI>baffl'd Cause.</HI> Pity indeed but that such rare Talents should be display'd, and not lie rusting in a Corner. Tho' equally a Pity 'tis, they had not been employ'd on a more worthy and defensible Sub∣ject. For I doubt he will shrink in his Figure, and come off with Shame: Since we often see the greatest <HI>Wits</HI> miscarry in a bold Dispute for want of a good Cause, as well as others of less Skill, for want of a good Con∣duct. However it seems He was resolv'd for once to venture, and comes into the Field with an unequal'd Zeal and Courage; perhaps <HI>trusting in his Armour</HI> more than in his Cause. He bravely enters the Lifts with <HI>several</HI> Adversaries together: And upon a view of them, taking 'em to be little impotent Animals, capable only to <HI>biss</HI> and <HI>spit their Venom,</HI> he despises and derides them, as <HI>Goliah</HI> (the famous Philistine of <HI>Gath,</HI> that proud Giant, who desy'd the Armies of <HI>Israel</HI>) disdain'd his Antagonist, <HI>David,</HI> as a puny STRIPLING; by no meant an equal Match for such a valiant, experienc'd Warrior as He. This Hero <HI>finds a strong Reluctance in encountring</HI> them; and scorns to be in Earnest, to put out his Strength, or shew his Skill: but only makes a few insignificant Flou∣rishes, and harmless undesigning Passes. He appears con∣tinually, like a Man in <HI>Jest,</HI> only to sport and play with them as <HI>Children:</HI> thinking perhaps, that it would be too a great an <HI>Honour</HI> put upon <HI>Them,</HI> and too much an <HI>Abuse</HI> of his <HI>own</HI> Intellectual Powers and Learning, to go to rea∣son and debate with Them in Earnest.— Or else He sus∣pected, that a <HI>Rational</HI> Defense of the <HI>Mod. Proof</HI> and <HI>the Discourse</HI> might possibly prove a <HI>laborious Task,</HI> that wou'd cost him a great Deal of Time, and be too long a Diversion from his better Employments. There∣fore he generally contents himself with peremptory Asser∣tions, warm Harangues, and witty Descants: summing up all (O the happiness he must needs feel▪) in glorious and triumphant Conclusions; tho' (alas) supported by little other Evidence, than the Assurance wherewith he lays them down.</P>
<P>INDEED, in that part of his Performance, which con∣cerns <HI>me</HI> more particularly, and which the following
<PB N="3" REF="002636_0005_0FE5D771E5D9C9F0"/>
Sheets are pointed against, (I mean the <HI>six last</HI> pages of his <HI>Appendix</HI>) He here <HI>varies</HI> his Mine and Shape very wonderfully; puts on some Features both of the <HI>Gentleman</HI> &amp; the <HI>Scholar;</HI> and not only regales me with unusual Airs of Civility, but also makes some Efforts to state &amp; argue matters like a <HI>Disputant.</HI> For when a Man's Passion, or his Humour of Jesting, has talkt it self out of breath, many times his Reason re∣covers, and takes its turn to speak.— Now therefore, to retaliate his Kindness, I shall study, thro' the whole of my Reply to him, to preserve a due <HI>Temper;</HI> and shall do him the Justice to represent his Arguments fairly, allow 'em their utmost Force, and give 'em a sober Consideration, a distinct Examination, and more large and particular than is really needful: because I'm willing to spare no pains in searching out the Truth in this disputed Subject; and that (if possible) I may help cast such a Light on the Controversy, as to satisfy im∣partial Inquirers. Therefore I shall make use of the <HI>Hints</HI> in my Antagonist, as occasions to speak <HI>largely</HI> to things. Indeed, were the Dispute between us al∣ready drawn out to any considerable Length, I shou'd pass over his brief <HI>Animadversions</HI> with general &amp; short Glances. For I suppose all that is necessary in a way of <HI>Reply</HI> to <HI>Them,</HI> might be compris'd in a very few Pages; as few, I presume, as those he has bestow'd on me. 'Tis but a small part of the <HI>Appendix,</HI> that's affect∣ed by what he has advanc'd against it; and what he has offer'd, seems to have so little Strength in it, that some have thought a labour'd Answer would be too great a Complement to him. However, for the Reasons hinted, I shall <HI>take occasion</HI> from his Animadversions, to handle the Points, that may fall in my way, somewhat <HI>largely.</HI> This must be remembred, or else I fear you'l censure me in many places, as laboriously &amp; vainly skirmishing with a Shadow. Which being premis'd, let me now without any further Ceremony or Apology come to the Remarks I have to offer.</P>
<P>I can easily forgive him the Blunder he begins with, in saying, <HI>The Author often varies Shapes &amp; Cha∣racters,
<PB N="4" REF="002636_0006_0FE5D77387299E40"/>
for now he personates an Independent, and anon a Ruling Elder:</HI> — as if there were no Ruling Elders among the Independents.</P>
<P>I will also pass over his next Reflection, which carries in it a Random-Shot at the <HI>Sectaries,</HI> who (he says) <HI>do all militate under the same common Standard of Schism and Rebellion:</HI> — for I am no more concern'd in this Observation than himself. Dismissing it then as wholly foreign; I come to his three <HI>Preliminaries,</HI> which are design'd to <HI>give a just Turn of Thought to those that have been under an unhappy Biass in the Controversy.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. AND here I concur with him, in the Substance of his <HI>first</HI> Preliminary, touching <HI>the Nature of the Apos∣tolical Commission,</HI> where he observes, <HI>That it is on all hands agreed to be the Grand Charter for the Evangeli∣cal Ministry;</HI> That <HI>it contains more in its Nature than is expressed;</HI> and that <HI>the Intent and Purport of it must be gathered from the Practice of the Apostles, as they understood and explained it in their acting by and upon it.</HI> Here, I confess, is <HI>a just Turn of Thought,</HI> but such a one as gives an unhappy Blow to his own Cause.</P>
<P>OBSERVE, He allows the <HI>Apostolical Commission</HI> to be the <HI>grand Charter</HI> for the <HI>Evangelical Ministry.</HI> By which, if I understand him right, he means, That this is the <HI>Diploma Regium,</HI> the Royal Warrant, License, or Patent, by which every true Gospel-Minister claims, or is authoriz'd and impower'd. I suppose He will consent to the Words of his Friend (and perhaps Countryman) <HI>Barclay,</HI> who thus expresseth his Sense of the Matter, (in his <HI>Persuasive,</HI> pag. 91.) <HI>It is by virtue of the Commission given to the</HI> Apostles <HI>by our Saviour, that any Man is an authorized Minister: And if it is not by virtue of this Commission, that</HI> ALL <HI>Gospel-Ministers are autho∣riz'd, I desire any one to shew what Authority they have and where it is founded.</HI> — Here is a good Comment on that Concession of my Animadverter. But perhaps it may be better to compare it with another Passage of his own elsewhere, which sufficiently explains his Sense.
<PB N="5" REF="002636_0007_0FE5D735866271F8"/>
It is in his <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">N.B. I call it <HI>His,</HI> (and shall go upon this Presumption in some further Observations afterwards) because of the near <HI>Affinity</HI> betwixt the strain of <HI>Reasoning</HI> in the <HI>Def.</HI> and in the <HI>Animadv,</HI> and because there are some very <HI>peculiar</HI> Turns of <HI>Language</HI> common to them both, &amp;c. which speaks them to be hammer'd on the same Anvil.</NOTE> <HI>Defence</HI> of <HI>Mod. Proof,</HI> (pag. 61.) where speaking of the Apostolical Commission, he affirms, <HI>That there are several Things contained in it, and several Offices warranted by it, as the Powers of Preaching, ad∣ministring the Sacraments, Ordination, and Government by proper Officers, and that</HI> ALL <HI>that discharge</HI> ANY <HI>of those Functions, act by virtue of</HI> THIS <HI>Commission.</HI> — Now I do assert, He has by these Concessions given a fatal wound to the Cause of Prelacy; and must think so, till he shall refute my Remarks on the like Expressions of Mr. <HI>Barclay</HI>'s, (See the <HI>Appendix,</HI> pag. 31,— 38.) where I have shewn, That hereby he hath disarm'd himself of his Herculean Argument, from the <HI>Seventy,</HI> and has put it intirely out of his power, by any other Medium what∣soever, to prove the Divine Right of Prelacy. I desire my Animadverter wou'd consult the Pages cited, and let us have his Animadversions upon them, as he wou'd do Justice to his Cause.</P>
<P>I agree with him, in the Remainder of his first Prelimi∣nary, viz. <HI>That the Apostles Commission contains more in its nature than is expressed, and that the Purport of it must be gather'd from their Practice upon it</HI> —. But then we must carefully observe the allow'd Distinction between their <HI>ordinary</HI> and their <HI>extraordinary</HI> Powers and actions. It is acreed on all sides, That the <HI>Apostles</HI> had some <HI>peculiar</HI> Powers, that were <HI>extraordinary,</HI> and <HI>temporary,</HI> and expir'd with their Persons: by virtue whereof they did this &amp; t'other extraordinary <HI>Action,</HI> that can't be drawn into a President for After-Ages, which af∣ford only such Officers, as succeed them in their <HI>ordinary Powers.</HI>— Under this head, the Author of <HI>Mod. Proof</HI> (pag, 33.) enumerates their <HI>Jurisdiction over all Churches and Pastors, their backing their Censures with
<PB N="6" REF="002636_0008_0FE5D7CE46E409C0"/>
Corporal Punishments, and perhaps their instituting new Gospel Officer, &amp;c.</HI> These Things we find in Fact they did: but that they did them <HI>by virtue</HI> of their Commission (in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28) <HI>as acting</HI> immediately <HI>by and upon it,</HI> I scarce believe my Animadverter will assert; because it is plain they were extraordinary Actions, and cou'd be done only by virtue of their extraordinary Powers. Whereas that <HI>Commission</HI> contains nothing beyond the <HI>ordinary</HI> Du∣ties and Powers, not peculiar to the Apostles, but common to all their Brethren and Successors in the Ministry. A∣greeably Bishop <HI>Hall,</HI> speaking of the Promise annexed, observes, <Q>Christ was with them, not in the Infalli∣bleness of their Judgment, nor in the Universality of their Charge; but in the effectual Execution of those Offices, which should be perpetuated to His Church for the Salvation of Mankind. Such were the Preaching of the Gospel, and the Administration of the Sacraments, the Ordaining Church-Officers, the ordering of Church affairs, the Infliction of Censures and the Power of the K<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</Q>— As to any Inspection and I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fluence over the <HI>Presbyters</HI> and constituted <HI>Churches,</HI> that the <HI>Apostles</HI> might have, and if they be supposed to exercise a <HI>Juris∣diction</HI> over them, this must be founded in the <HI>extraordi∣nary Powers,</HI> which were peculiar to themselves, and tempo∣rary; as I have argu'd elsewhere (<HI>Append.</HI> to Sob. Rem. p. 26, 27.) unto which I can't find the <HI>Animadverter</HI> has said any thing, to take off the force of my Reasoning there: I shall think it stands good then, till I hear fur∣ther from him; and upon a review, perhaps it may ap∣pear to him not unworthy of some serious Reflections.</P>
<P>AND now I shall hint three or four things to set the <HI>Nature of this Commission</HI> in a true Light, from the <HI>Practice of the Apostles by and upon it;</HI> which I doubt not will make the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Hypothesis as clear as plain Fact can make a thing.</P>
<P>IN the first place, we may observe, While the Apostles remain'd at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> after Christ's Ascension, (which <HI>Eusebius</HI> reports, was for <HI>several Years</HI>) they acted in a complete <HI>Parity:</HI> and even <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> (who seemed to be <HI>Pillars,</HI> as much as <HI>James,</HI> pretended to be
<PB N="7" REF="002636_0009_0FE5D77670C98850"/>
Bishop of Jerusalem) were <HI>sent out</HI> by their Brethren, upon a particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rrand to <HI>Samaria.</HI> (<HI>Act.</HI> 8 14) And afterwards we find this Equality continu'd among the Bishops and Pastors in the Church at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> Hence it is said, <HI>Act.</HI> 11.22. THEY <HI>sent forth Barnabas.</HI> The Act passeth not in the name of a Prelate, nor of the A∣postles. So in <HI>Act.</HI> 15. we read of a matter of Contro∣versy refer'd to the Decision o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the <HI>Apostles &amp; Elders</HI> at <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> and it is said. <HI>The</HI> Apostles and Elders <HI>came together to consider of this matter: and there</HI> was <HI>much Disputing:</HI> and when they were come to a Determination, the Result passed in the Names of them all without Distinction. [The <HI>Decrees</HI> are said to be <HI>ordained of the Apostles &amp; Elders.]</HI> Then they <HI>all agreed</HI> to send chosen Men or their own Company, with <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> to carry their Letters to <HI>Anticch.</HI> So that in all the managements in the Church at <HI>Jeru∣salem</HI> hitherto, there appears not the least sign or shadow of a Prelacy. And doubtless all other Churches were form'd after the same Model with that.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, observe, when the Apostles planted a Church in any Place, they settled a <HI>Plurality</HI> of Pres∣byters in it. Thus we read, <HI>Act.</HI> 14.23. <HI>Paul &amp; Barna∣bas ordained them Elders in every Church.</HI> A number of Elders; and no mention of a Bishop <HI>set over</HI> them.</P>
<P>THESE Elders were themselves <HI>Bishops,</HI> and <HI>Church-Rulers.</HI> My <HI>Animadverter</HI> himself shall be my Voucher for this; who tells us, that the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> which the <HI>A∣postles settled in the Churches,</HI> and particularly <HI>those at Corinth, had the Powers both of Sacraments &amp; Cen∣sures:</HI> and for proof he alledges 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 5.5, 7, 12, 13. and 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2 6. If we consult these places, we shall find the Apostle speaks to the Corinthian Elders as <HI>Church-Rulers,</HI> vested with the Power of the Keys. We shall find they passed the highest Church-Censure on the In∣cestuous Person; and then absolv'd him again upon his Repentance. So that they exercis'd the power of the Keys both in <HI>Binding</HI> and in <HI>Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sing.</HI> My Animadver∣ter therefore well ascribes unto them <HI>the Powers both of Sacraments &amp; Censures.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="002636_0010_0FE5D77E5C6BDD18"/>AND indeed this is but agreeable to the Doctrine of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> as it may be gather'd out of the <HI>Public Offices;</HI> where we find <HI>Presbyters</HI> receiving a pretty advanc'd Character, as <HI>Rulers</HI> and Pastors. Thus, They seem to have Authority over the <HI>Deacons,</HI> as ap∣pears by the <HI>Deacons</HI> Ordination-Vow, wherein They promise <HI>Reverently to obey Their Ordinary</HI> [the Bishop's Suffragan, who is at best but a Presbyter] <HI>and other chief Ministers of the Church</HI> [Presbyters still] AND <HI>Them to whom the Charge &amp; Government over them is com∣mitted:</HI> By whom, I suppose, was originally intended the <HI>Pastors</HI> of the respective Congregations, to which those Deacons were imploy'd to minister. As seems very probable, if we compare the Promise here, with that of the <HI>Priests;</HI> which runs in a different strain: The Priest promising to obey his <HI>Ordinary, and other chief Ministers, unto whom is committed</HI> &amp;c. Where the Form of Expression is alter'd. Here it is—<HI>Chief Mi∣nisters, unto whom—.</HI> Whereas in the former Office, it is—<HI>Chief Ministers,</HI> AND <HI>Them to whom—.</HI> Which material Variation of the Form seems plainly to speak the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> who are a superior order unto <HI>Deacons,</HI> to have committed to them a Government over Those of this <HI>inferior Office,</HI> who minister in their Congrega∣tions.—But however it be in that Case, be sure the <HI>Presbyters</HI> have (according to the English Model) a go∣verning Power over the <HI>Flock.</HI> If we look into the <HI>Form of ordering Priests,</HI> we shall find a great deal to countenance this Assertion. Thus in the Charge that is given them the Figures of <HI>Shepherds, Watchmen, Messen∣gers,</HI> and <HI>Stewards</HI> of the Lord, are pursued, and the Places of Scripture, relating to These are applied to them. And then in the Ordination-Vow, the Bishop takes a Promise of them, <HI>That they will give their faith∣ful Diligence so to minister the Doctrine and Sacra∣ments, and the</HI> Discipline <HI>of Christ, as the Lord hath commanded,—unto the People committed to their</HI> Cure <HI>and</HI> Charge: — <HI>and that they will be ready with all faithful Diligence to</HI> Banish <HI>and</HI> DRIVE away <HI>all er∣roneous and strange Doctrines,</HI> &amp;c. And then, it is re∣markable, at the Imposition of Hands, the <HI>Bishop</HI> says to
<PB N="9" REF="002636_0011_0FE5D77F3B4FE620"/>
the <HI>Priest</HI> ordained, — <HI>Whose Sins</HI> Thou <HI>dost forgive, they are forgiven; and whose Sins</HI> thou <HI>dost retain, they are retained.</HI> Which are the express Words of the <HI>Apostolical</HI> Commission, <HI>John</HI> 20 — And tho' these words are order'd to be read for the <HI>Gospel,</HI> at the Conse∣cration of a <HI>Bishop,</HI> yet they are not <HI>repeated</HI> in the Form of Ordination, or at the Imposition of Hands: for which I cannot think of a more natural <HI>Reason</HI> than this, <HI>viz.</HI> Because the Office of <HI>Presbyter</HI> still subsists in the <HI>Bishop,</HI> unto which <HI>all</HI> the Power imply'd in <HI>those Words</HI> do properly belong; and the Presbyter receives no <HI>new</HI> or superadded Power, as of <HI>Divine Right,</HI> at his Con∣secration to the Episcopate, but only is advanced to a Degree of Dignity and Authority, that has arisen out of some <HI>prudential Constitutions</HI> Ecclesiastical and Civil: and therefore the Repetition or Delivery of the <HI>Apostoli∣cal</HI> Commission to him, upon this Preferment, is tho't un∣necessary. So that (as I hinted in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> pag. 24.) it should seem that the Church of <HI>England</HI> supposes her <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Presbyters</HI> to be equally vested with the Power of <HI>Discipline, according to the Word of GOD;</HI> and what <HI>Difference</HI> there is in the Exercise of it, must be grounded on <HI>Human</HI> Constitutions. And indeed this Distinction is hinted to us, when the <HI>Bishop,</HI> at his Conse∣cration, promises — <HI>to correct and punish the Crimi∣nous within his Diocess, according to such Authority as be</HI> hath <HI>by God's</HI> Word, &amp; <HI>as to him shall be committed by the ordinance of</HI> this Realm. — Upon the whole it appears that my <HI>Animadverter</HI> has spoken the original Sense of his own Church, as well as confessed to a Scrip∣ture-Doctrine, in asserting the <HI>Presbyters</HI> having <HI>the Powers both of Sacraments and Censures.</HI> — But if I mistake not, this Concession, which the force of Teach (more perhaps than the want of Thought) has extorted from him, will prove the utter <HI>Subversion</HI> of his <HI>Cause,</HI> For it is one of the first Principles in his Scheme, <HI>That the Powers of Government and Ordination are annexed, alia<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> connected. This is a Maxim the Gentleman oft inculcates, and is what Episcopalians generally maintain. Now they that have <HI>the Powers both of Sacraments and Censures,</HI> must be own'd to have the governing Power in
<PB N="10" REF="002636_0012_0FE5D780098BE0D0"/>
their Hands. He that denies this, must certainly have a very odd Turn of Thought; and my Animadverter must needs be <HI>under an unhappy Biass</HI> (indeed) <HI>in the Con∣troversy,</HI> if he denies Presbyters the power of <HI>Ordination,</HI> after he has thus asserted their governing Power, and proclaim'd them Parochial Bishops.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps he may <HI>object:</HI> This Arguing is vain; for there must this necessary Distinction be observ'd, <HI>That the Government,</HI> with which <HI>Ordination</HI> is connected, <HI>is not that of meer</HI> Presbyters <HI>over their single Flocks, but that of</HI> Diocesan Bishops <HI>over a Plurality of Churches and their Pastors. The Government of</HI> Prelates, <HI>and that of</HI> Presbyters, <HI>are two different sorts of Govern∣ment; and the Government which the Power of</HI> Ordina∣tion <HI>was annexed to, is that of</HI> Prelates <HI>taken in its proper present Ecclesiastical Sense, and not that that meer</HI> Pres∣byters <HI>have over their single Congregations.</HI> So he dis∣tinguishes in his <HI>Def. of Mod. Proof,</HI> p. 21.</P>
<P>TO which I answer, That this Distinction appears to be <HI>without any just Foundation.</HI> For there are not two such different Species of Church-Governours, as he speaks of. Either <HI>Presbyters</HI> have the <HI>complete</HI> Power of Ec∣clesiastical Rule, or they have <HI>none</HI> at all. The latter is contrary to the declared Sense of my Animadverter: He expresly allows them a <HI>Government over their Flocks,</HI> even <HI>the Powers both of Sacraments and Censures;</HI> which implies, I think, no small Degree of Authority vested in them: But how fatal to his Argument, is this Acknow∣legement! He here lashes his own Error; and turns Traitor to his own Cause.— For I ask the Gentleman, how he supposes the <HI>Presbyters</HI> came by so much ruling Power? What <HI>Commission</HI> is it founded in? For, if it doth not result from some Divine Commission, that they are invested with, <HI>it is a very criminal Presumption and an unsufferable Insolence in Them</HI> to lay claim to it: <HI>a daring Offence</HI> it must needs be, equal at least to what They are guilty of, who <HI>approach before God's Altar without the appointed Rites of Consecration.</HI> I ask then, What Commission it is founded in? Is it the
<PB N="11" REF="002636_0013_0FE5D73793072B88"/>
Commission of the <HI>Seventy?</HI> No surely; for that doth not contain <HI>the Powers both of Sacraments and Censures.</HI> Where then shall we look to find the original of this their governing Power? Shall we repair to <HI>Matth.</HI> 28. and refer it to the <HI>Apostolical</HI> Commission? <HI>Yes;</HI> for if it be not imply'd <HI>there,</HI> it is no where in the Bible. And besides the Gentleman himself, (in his <HI>Def. of Mod. Proof,</HI> p. 61.) vouches this for their Warrant, and expresly affirms, <HI>That it is</HI> by vertue <HI>of this Commission,</HI> that Pres∣byters <HI>discharge the Function of Preaching and Admi∣nistring the Sacraments, and exercise the Powers of Absolution and Censures.</HI> Well but if that Com∣mission belongs to them, which is the <HI>highest</HI> in the Church, how can there be any suppos'd of a <HI>superior</HI> Order to Them? And how come the <HI>Presbyters</HI> to have any Title or Relation at all to <HI>that</HI> Com∣mission; which was given immediately to the twelve <HI>Apostles,</HI> and <HI>not</HI> to the <HI>Seventy Disciples?</HI> Why truly here is the Difficulty, and the <HI>Self-repugnance,</HI> in our Animadverter's Scheme. For it is a Paradox to me, That <HI>Presbyters</HI> should have a <HI>governing Power</HI> in the Church, by <HI>vertue</HI> of the Commission given to the <HI>Apostles;</HI> and yet really be no more than Successors to the <HI>Seventy Dis∣ciples,</HI> whose Commission contain'd <HI>nothing</HI> of such an Ecclesiastical Authority. I wonder by what new Logick the Gentleman will be able to accommodate these two jarring Principles of his. He has cast his Cause upon a palpable Contradiction; and while he essays to gore us with <HI>both Horns</HI> at once, we may hope to escape without Harm from either.</P>
<P>FURTHERMORE, As to these governing Presbyters it may be observed, we find none of them claiming a <HI>Su∣periority over their Brethren;</HI> nay, the very <HI>Apostles</HI> themselves made no pretensions to any <HI>Supremacy,</HI> or Prelatical Power over them, as Officers of another and higher Order. We do not find that the Apostles claim'd a <HI>Negative</HI> upon the ordinary Pastors, and the Churches, in matters of Government, nor so much as a Right of Precedency, as superior Officers. They own'd <HI>Presbyters</HI> (as in the forementioned case of the <HI>Corinthian</HI> Elders)
<PB N="12" REF="002636_0014_0FE5D7831FC8F298"/>
to have the <HI>Power of the Keys,</HI> and seem to know no∣thing of their being limited to exercise them by <HI>Aposto∣lical</HI> Direction and Consent. — And in the case of <HI>Missions,</HI> the Apostles used no coercive Power over the Presbyters, but took their <HI>free Consent;</HI> without which they went not. Thus the Apostle Paul told the <HI>Corin∣thians</HI> (1 Epis. 16.12) <HI>As touching our Brother</HI> Apollos, <HI>I greatly desired him to come unto you with the Bre∣thren, but his Will was not at all to come at this Time; but he will come, when he shall have convenient Time.</HI> Now, according to the Author of <HI>Mod. Proof,</HI> (pag. 30.) <HI>Apollos</HI> was but a <HI>Presbyter;</HI> and yet you see he acted his own Inclinations, in opposition to Apostolical Intrea∣ties: which betokens but little Sense of any Subjection to the Apostle, as his Superior and Ruler.</P>
<P>BUT, in a word; whatsoever <HI>clear Indication</HI> may be pretended <HI>of a Distinction &amp; Subordination between the Presbyters and the Apostles,</HI> the same is equally clear with respect to some others that are supposed to be <HI>Prelates;</HI> who appear to be as much in Subjection to the Apostles, as the Presbyters. For Instance, <HI>Timothy</HI> is said to <HI>minister</HI> unto <HI>Paul,</HI> to be <HI>sent</HI> by him hither and thither, to receive <HI>Commandment</HI> from him <HI>&amp;c:</HI> Which carries as plain Signatures of <HI>Paul</HI>'s Jurisdiction over this supposed <HI>Prelate,</HI> as are any where to be seen of his Jurisdiction over Presbyters. Now, (supposing that to be in fact a proper Exercise of <HI>Authority</HI>) I put it to my Animadverter, — Whether he looks on the Apostle as therein acting by an <HI>ordinary</HI> Power, or by an <HI>extra∣ordinary?</HI> Or, in other words, Whether or no He looks on this <HI>Apostolic Practice</HI> as giving us any <HI>Explanation</HI> of the <HI>Commission?</HI> And take it which way he will, I ask how he can reconcile it with <HI>his</HI> Scheme of Things. For, if he supposes the Apostle to act herein by and up∣on his Apostolical Commission, and so explaining it, and leaving a Precedent; then it seems (according to the Animadverter's way of arguing) we must not only have Prelates in the Church, but also <HI>another</HI> order <HI>superior</HI> to Them: and thus there will be more than <HI>three</HI> orders; which is contrary to his own Scheme. — But if he de∣termines
<PB N="13" REF="002636_0015_0FE5D7872DD84078"/>
the Apostle's Practice, in regard of his Juris∣diction over <HI>Timothy, not</HI> to be an Explanation of the Apostolic Commission, then say I, no more is the Juris∣diction, that the Apostles are supposed to have exercised over <HI>Presbyters.</HI> For (to borrow here a short Parenthesis from the <HI>Remarker</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sob. Rem.</HI> p. 38. Edit. 2.</NOTE>) <Q>No man is able to give me a∣ny tolerable reason, why their Government over <HI>Bi∣shops</HI> shou'd be grounded on an <HI>extraordinary</HI> Power, and yet their Government over <HI>Pastors</HI> be by virtue of their <HI>ordinary</HI> Power.</Q> Whatever Authority over them the Apostles may be suppos'd to have had, it did not result from their ordinary Commission: and so af∣fords no Pattern to succeeding Ages, nor gives the least Countenance to Prelatical Usurpations.</P>
<P>SO then, upon the Whole, I may very justly draw up this Conclusion (the Reverse of my <HI>Animadverter's) That if following the Explanations given of this Commission by Apostolick Practice be warrantable, the Assertors of</HI> Presbyterian Parity <HI>are undoubtedly in the Right.</HI>—</P>
<P>BEFORE I pass to his next general head, I might take No∣tice of what he insinuates here (1) concerning the <HI>Deacons, That we find in Fact, that the Apostles ordained them; besides some lower Offices, to preach and baptise.</HI> — By this he must mean, Either that <HI>we find they in fact or∣dain'd</HI> the Deacons to the works of <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Bapti∣sing;</HI> which is directly <HI>contrary</HI> to the Account we have of their Institution, <HI>Act.</HI> 6. <HI>begin.</HI> — Or else that <HI>we find in Fact</HI> the Deacons <HI>did</HI> preach and baptise, &amp; from thence must <HI>infer</HI> they were <HI>ordain'd</HI> to these Offices. Now if this be his Meaning, let him consult the <HI>Appen∣dix</HI> (pag. 38, &amp;c.) and he will find I have sufficiently ex∣pos'd the Vanity of such Pretences, in a way of Arguing too somewhat different from the <HI>Remarker;</HI> so that the An∣swer to <HI>him</HI> will not suffice for a Reply to <HI>Me:</HI> and yet the <HI>Animadverter</HI> silently passes over my Observations on this Head, as he has done in many other Instances — And now, as to what he affirms in the next Place, concern∣ing <HI>Presbyters, That those which the Apostles settled in
<PB N="14" REF="002636_0016_0FE5D75BC8C16CB0"/>
the Churches (as at</HI> Corinth) <HI>had the Powers both of Sa∣craments and Censures;</HI> — I shall add nothing to the Remarks made upon it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>: save, that <HI>Here is an im∣plicit Condemnation of His own Church;</HI> which (what∣ever are it's Principles &amp; Doctrine, <HI>before hinted;</HI> yet) does i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>fact</HI> and practice not only strip the Presbyters of those P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ral Powers, but reduces them to a degree of <HI>Subjecti∣on</HI> and <HI>Servility,</HI> scarce fit to be mention'd. For, as to Ecclesiastical <HI>Censures,</HI> these (it is said) are intirely manag'd in the <HI>Bishops</HI> Court, without the <HI>Concurrence,</HI> or so much as <HI>Knowlege</HI> many times, of the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver those more immediately concern'd in the Case. The <HI>Bishop</HI> do's not ordinarily so much as <HI>consult</HI> with <HI>them</HI> about the matter. Nay, he turns it over to a <HI>Lay Chancellor,</HI> and other <HI>Officials</HI> of that Court, who have not any inherent and proper Ecclesiastical Authority, but are <HI>deputed</HI> by the Bishop; and whose Acts, tho' they always run in the Bishop's <HI>Name,</HI> yet are not always pass<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d with the Bishop's <HI>Consent:</HI> but however <HI>must</HI> be submitted to, and comply'd with by the <HI>Clergy,</HI> who are in a manner only the Bishop's <HI>Curates,</HI> and divested of all their share in the Government.— And then as to the <HI>Sacraments,</HI> the Power of these is not so lodg'd with the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> as that they may administer them to those <HI>Subjects,</HI> and in that <HI>Manner,</HI> which their own Judgment directs 'em to; but if they go to pursue this, they expose themselves many times to great Inconvenien∣cies, as the History of SIXTY-TWO very loudly testifies.— Hence, when my <HI>Animadverter</HI> affirms, <HI>Presbyters</HI> had ori∣ginally <HI>the Powers both of Sacraments and Censures,</HI> He asserts a Truth, that casts no little Reproach on the Practice of his own Church, as well as gives an oblique Stroke, fatal to his Cause.— And now as to what he ob∣serves, in the last place. <HI>That Diocesan</HI> Bishops, <HI>in whom the Powers of Ordination &amp; Jurisdiction over a Plura∣lity of</HI> Presbyters <HI>&amp; Churches were annexed, were set∣tled by the Apostles, in their respective Sees;</HI> for Evi∣dence of which he alleges the Instances of <HI>Timothy,</HI> and <HI>Titus,</HI> and the <HI>Apocalyptical Angels,</HI> and refers us to his <HI>Defence</HI> of the <HI>Modest Proof:</HI> I shall make no Ob∣servations upon it, but leave the <HI>Remarker</HI> to say <HI>how fully he has made this to appear.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="002636_0017_0FE5D7888CCC0040"/>II. HAVING thus <HI>adjusted</HI> the first Preliminary, I pass now to the <HI>Second,</HI> which concerns <HI>the Nature of the Gift conferred in Ordination;</HI> where he affirms that <HI>thereby is unquestionably meant the Office &amp; the Power whereby to discharge it, and not the Holy Ghost.</HI> Upon which I shall not enter into any Controversy with Him, but taking him in his own way, will pass it over, with only two or three Reflections.</P>
<P>IN the first place, I think, the Gentleman delivers his Opinion with too great an Air of Assurance, as if it were <HI>unquestionable;</HI> when he does or may know, that some of the greatest <HI>Doctors</HI> of his own Church are <HI>against</HI> Him. Thus <HI>Dr. Hammond</HI> paraphrases on 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.14. <HI>Neglect not the Gift that is in Thee</HI> &amp;c. i. e. Make use of those Gifts, which <HI>in order to</HI> thy Func∣tion were given thee at thy Ordination —. And Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> calls the <HI>Charisma</HI> here mentioned, a <HI>Spiritual</HI> Gift, the Gift of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> an <HI>ex∣traordinary</HI> Gift, conferred only in those Times, by the Hands of an <HI>Apostle,</HI> and now wholly ceased. [<HI>See his Notes on</HI> 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.14. &amp; 2. <HI>Tim</HI> 1.6] <Q>Not∣withstanding (as he observes, on <HI>Act.</HI> 8.15.) This may well be deem'd a fit Pattern for <HI>Bishops</HI> to follow in the Apostolical Rite of Confirmation &amp; Ordination by laying on of Hands; by which THEY, as <HI>Successors</HI> of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> CONFER the <HI>ordinary</HI> Gifts of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> as the <HI>Apostles</HI> did the <HI>extraordinary</HI> Gifts of the same Spirit</Q>. Thus you see both these learned Expositors thwart my <HI>Animadverter;</HI> and yet he lays down his Opinion as <HI>unquestionably</HI> certain.</P>
<P>BUT in the second place, I would observe, As he is too sanguine and dogmatical in his Assertions, so he is too <HI>loose</HI> and <HI>careless</HI> in his Language upon this Point. What crude and uncouth (not to say, criminal and profane) Expressions are those; when, speaking of the HOLY GHOST (a Divin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Person) he says, <HI>Its Influences are conveyed by its glorious AUTHOR,</HI> — and — <HI>Its self must flow from the Fountain of it!</HI> — These, I suppose, are <HI>Errata,</HI> that can't be charg'd to the Account
<PB N="16" REF="002636_0018_0FE59B5852B67760"/>
of the <HI>Printer:</HI> or, I admire they should escape the criti∣cal <HI>Corrector</HI>'s Eye.</P>
<P>IN the last place, we may observe the <HI>Impertinence</HI> of the <HI>Reason</HI> He here assi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ns for his Opinio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, That by the <HI>Gift</HI> mentioned is not meant the <HI>Holy Ghost;</HI> viz. Because <HI>This never was, nor is it possible to be, in the Power of Man to bestow.</HI> For He had no manner of <HI>Occasion,</HI> from my Discourse on this Head, to make any such Remark, since I never asserted such a Power <HI>(in his Sense)</HI> to be in the Apostles, or any others: neither do I believe <HI>it ever was, or is possible to be, in the</HI> Heart <HI>of any Man,</HI> to imagine such a Thing; unless <HI>Simon Magu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> may go for an Instance of such Whimsy and Distraction.— And then, It is a Reason that may be easily <HI>turn'd upon Himself,</HI> and will be as valid an Ob∣jection against <HI>his</HI> Interpretation of the <HI>Gift</HI> mentioned, i. e. <HI>The Office &amp; the Power whereby to discharge it.</HI> So that here in effect he do's but c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ff his own Ears.— To set this in its just Light, let us for once admit the Hypothesis of the <HI>Divine Right</HI> of Prelacy; and apply what the Gentleman says, to the Office of <HI>Bishops,</HI> (which I the rather chuse to do, because <HI>Timothy</HI> the Person receiving the Gift mentioned, is voted a <HI>Prelate</HI>) and by his own way of arguing, it will appear, that every authorized <HI>Bishop</HI> derives his <HI>Office</HI> and Power from our blessed <HI>Lord</HI> Himself, and not from his <HI>Ordainers. For tho' indeed in the Conveying of it, Means &amp; In∣struments are made use of,</HI> and He is solemnly consecra∣ted to it by Fasting &amp; Prayer, with <HI>Imposition of Hands; yet no Creature, in a proper sense, can be said to con∣fer it.</HI> And therefore when any speak of the Bishops <HI>con∣ferring Orders,</HI> or of their consecrating any to the <HI>Epis∣copate,</HI> it must not be understood as if they did actually <HI>bestow</HI> it: <HI>their Action indeed is the Conduit of its Conveyance, but its self must flow from the Fountain of it.</HI>— I cannot but think our Animadverter is of opinion, That <HI>Bishops</HI> are commissionated immediately by their great <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Master;</HI> or, that it is <HI>He</HI> who gives the Power by <HI>His Commission</HI> (the same that was given to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> the first Bishops) and that no <HI>Creature</HI> on
<PB N="17" REF="002636_0019_0FE59B4A00F2E3B0"/>
Earth is nor can be a Principal Cause, or authoritative Donor, and Efficient in that Case: but that the Electors only determin the Person or Recipient, and the Ordainers only <HI>invest</HI> him, and solem<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ize his Entrance into his Office. The <HI>Apostolical Commission</HI> is what this Gen∣tleman himself calls the <HI>Original Charter,</HI> and so allows to be the <HI>Fundamentum Juris,</HI> the Scource and Mea∣sure of the Bishop's Right &amp; Power: who claims by this, and acts upon it. And hence they that consecrate Him, are but <HI>Ministerial Deliverers of Possession;</HI> are but the <HI>Channels of Conveyance,</HI> and not the immediate <HI>Fountains</HI> of the Power vested in Him. He derives this from a higher Original, from the <HI>Magna Charta,</HI> the grand <HI>Charter</HI> of CHRIST; as the <HI>Mayor</HI> of a Town-Corporate derives all his Authority from the <HI>King's Charter,</HI> which upon his Election <HI>authorises</HI> and obliges him to the Execution of his Office, instituted and describ'd in the Charter; Tho' this directs also to a public and solemn <HI>Instalment</HI> of Him; before which he is not to ex∣ercise Authority, nor claim Obedience: and yet the <HI>Mayor</HI>'s Power originates <HI>wholly</HI> from the <HI>Royal Charter.</HI> Even so the <HI>Bishop</HI>'s Power must draw it's Origin whol∣ly from <HI>Christ's Charter:</HI> and if they that consecrate him to his Office, do pretend to <HI>confer</HI> it upon Him, it is as if the <HI>Recorder,</HI> who installs my Lord <HI>Mayor,</HI> shou'd feign himself the Fountain or Donor of the Majoral Power; which wou'd be unpardonable Arro∣gance in him, equal to the intolerable Ignorance, which any one wou'd betray, that should credit him.— These Thoughts, I'm persuaded, cannot but be very agreeable to one of my <HI>Animadverter</HI>'s Genius; so warm an Assertor of <HI>Episcopal Dignity!</HI> For, as our Lord said to the <HI>Pharisees,</HI> Ye Fools and Blind! <HI>Whether is greater, the</HI> Gift, <HI>or the</HI> Altar <HI>that sanctifieth the Gift?</HI> So say I, Whether is greater, Human Ordination, or Christ's Commission, that alone enforces it? And, which reflects most Lustre on our <HI>Bishops,</HI> to say, Their Au∣thority is of <HI>Men,</HI> or that it is of <HI>God;</HI> from <HI>their</HI> Imposition of Hands, or from the Charter of CHRIST; <HI>Judge ye.</HI>— However, if any one will insist upon <HI>an external visible Commission</HI> given by the <HI>Ordainers,</HI> is the
<PB N="18" REF="002636_0020_0FE5D78951669ED0"/>
immediate Principle &amp; Support of <HI>Prelatical Power,</HI> He shall not have <HI>me</HI> at present for his <HI>Adversary.</HI> For, as the Apostle said to the Corinthians, <HI>These Things, Brethren, I have in a figure transferred to my Self &amp; Apollo;</HI> Even so I have used such a Scheme o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Speech, in arguing with my Animadverter, to gild over the Pill, that it might go down with more ease, and work with efficacy. And I hope I have said enough to make him sensible, that he has built his Opinion (about the <HI>Gift</HI> mention'd) on a <HI>weak</HI> and <HI>sandy Foundation.</HI>— Tho' as to the Opinion it self, I suspend; and it shall be no matter of Contest between us at present. But I'll now dismiss the Second Preliminary, and come to the <HI>Third</HI> and Last.</P>
<P N="3">III. AND here I fully agree with him, <HI>That the</HI> Apos∣tles <HI>were not meer Presbyters</HI> [in the modern Sense] but <HI>were vested with proper Episcopal Powers,</HI> even the Power of Ordination and Jurisdiction. And I further grant, that they had some sort of Influence and Inspection <HI>over the Presbyters and the Churches too;</HI> yea, and over his supposed <HI>Prelates</HI> likewise.</P>
<P>BUT then <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o <HI>adjust this Preliminary,</HI> I must add an Observation or two. As,</P>
<P N="1">(1.) THAT the <HI>Episcopal Powers</HI> mentioned, were not <HI>peculiar</HI> to the Apostles, but common to all <HI>Pastors</HI> or Presbyters: As plainly appears from what I have said above, &amp; have further to offer. And then it must be observ'd, —</P>
<P N="2">(2.) AS to the <HI>Superiority</HI> over <HI>Presbyters,</HI> ascri∣bed to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> it is granted by me only in a <HI>re∣strain'd</HI> and <HI>qualify'd</HI> Sense. Here,</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> I wou'd not be understood to assert a Superio∣rity of proper imperative <HI>Prelatical Power,</HI> founded in a∣ny peculiar Office or Commission held by Them; but a <HI>directive</HI> or <HI>declarative</HI> Power; Whereby they had a Right to instruct Presbyters in the reveal'd Truths and Laws of the Gospel, and inculcate their Duty upon them, to rebuke the Scandalous and Heretical, to pronounce 'em (if impenitent) unworthy of their Office, and warn the People to avoid them &amp;c. But as to any proper <HI>Imperi∣al, Judicial,</HI> and <HI>Coercive</HI> Power over Them, I cannot
<PB N="19" REF="002636_0021_0FE5D79302ECD720"/>
find any Footsteps of it, either in the <HI>Acts</HI> or <HI>Letters</HI> of the Apostles; nor any Foundation for it, either in their Commission, or in any Rules of Reason. So that I can∣not at present but conceive of the <HI>Apostles</HI> as being in relation to the <HI>Christian</HI> Church, and the Pastors of it, very much what the inspired <HI>Prophets</HI> in former times were to the <HI>Jewish</HI> Church and its ordinary Teachers. But however,—</P>
<P><HI>Secondly.</HI> I wou'd have it observ'd, that whatever go∣verning Power the Apostles might have over <HI>Presbyters</HI> or ordinary Pastors and the Churches. (Yea admit, if you will, it amounted even to a proper <HI>Legislative</HI> and <HI>Com∣pulsive</HI> Power) yet I do not suppose it to be <HI>Successive,</HI> or deriv'd to Those who succeed the Apostles; and that for this <HI>Reason,</HI>— Because Such a Power must be found∣ed in their <HI>extraordinary Mission</HI> &amp; <HI>Inspiration,</HI> and cou'd not be any part of their <HI>ordinary</HI> and <HI>standing Character,</HI> or belong to them in <HI>that Capacity,</HI> wherein only they are allow'd to have <HI>Successors.</HI>— I have had occasion to say something before, that might suffice for the Proof of This. But I will add, for the further Clearing of it, this Obser∣vation, <HI>That the Apostles ordinary Capacity was</HI> SINGLE, <HI>and but one;</HI> or such as wherein they cou'd represent but <HI>one Kind</HI> of <HI>Church-Ruler,</HI> and that is a <HI>Parish Rector</HI> or <HI>Pastor</HI> of a particular Congregation, and not the <HI>Diocesan</HI> Bishop. Which I shall essay to prove, in such a Gradati∣on of Thought, as will make it Mathematically evident: and for the better Distinction, I will make use of Ordinal Numbers, in laying down my <HI>Propositions,</HI> which are these.</P>
<P N="1">1. THE <HI>Apostolical</HI> Commission is the grand <HI>Charter</HI> for the Evangelical Ministry. This we have heard our A∣nimadverter already confessing. Therefore,</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>whole Complex</HI> of Apostolical Power, in the <HI>ordinary</HI> and permanent Branches of it, was included in that one Commission. And,</P>
<P N="3">3. THE Ministerial Powers, contained in that Com∣mission, were by the Apostles preserv'd <HI>undivided,</HI> and de∣liver'd
<PB N="20" REF="002636_0022_0FE5D793CEF27250"/>
without any <HI>Limitations,</HI> to all the Recipients of it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As I've prov'd in <HI>Appendix</HI> to <HI>Sob. Rem.</HI> (Vid. p 32—36.) which my <HI>Respondent</HI> having not taken notice of, nor brought any thing to invalidate the Argu∣ments there offer'd, this Conclusion appears to me still very well grafted on solid Reasons.</NOTE> Hence,</P>
<P N="4">4. THEY to whom this Commission truly belongs, are actually invested with <HI>all</HI> the Powers given in it. Now,</P>
<P N="5">5. THOSE who are invested with <HI>one Commission,</HI> in all the Powers of it, must be of one and the same <HI>Order</HI> or Kind. Therefore,</P>
<P N="6">6 AS the <HI>Apostles</HI> Commission was but one, so their ordinary Capacity was but one, and such as in which they cou'd represent but one kind of <HI>Church-Ruler. Q. E. D.</HI></P>
<P>And now—</P>
<P N="7">7. THIS Church-Ruler is not the <HI>Diocesan</HI> Bishop, but the <HI>Congregational</HI> Bishop, or Presbyter: As will ap∣pear, if we duly weigh things. For consider, in the next place,</P>
<P N="8">8. THE Government of <HI>Prelates</HI> and that of <HI>Presby∣ters</HI> are <HI>two Sorts</HI> of Government. This the Defender of the <HI>Mod. Proof</HI> takes notice of, <HI>pag.</HI> 21. Hence, in the</P>
<P N="9">9th place, THE <HI>Prelatical</HI> Bishop, and the <HI>Parochial,</HI> are two distinct Species of Officers. And consequently, in the</P>
<P N="10">10th place, THEY <HI>cannot both</HI> subsist on <HI>one</HI> and the <HI>same</HI> Commission, nor cou'd the Apostles represent them <HI>both</HI> in their ordinary Capacity: but one or t'other must necessarily be <HI>excluded.</HI> But now, in the</P>
<P N="11">11th place, WE are agreed on all sides, that <HI>Congre∣gational</HI> Bishops, or <HI>Presbyters,</HI> do act in the discharge of their Office, <HI>by virtue</HI> of the <HI>Apostolical Commission,</HI> and by it are vested with <HI>the Powers of Preaching, and of Sacraments and Censures.</HI> To this we have a repeat∣ed full Confession from the <HI>Animadverter.</HI> And hence, in the</P>
<P N="12">12th place, <HI>PRESBYTERS</HI> have a just Claim to <HI>all</HI> the Powers contain'd in that Commission, (according to
<PB N="21" REF="002636_0023_0FE5D794EB14E288"/>
<HI>Prop.</HI> 3 &amp; 4) and must be voted Successors to the A∣postles in the <HI>whole</HI> of their ordinary Capacity. Which, by an unavoidable Consequence, infers, (agreeable to <HI>Prop.</HI> 8.9. &amp; 10th.) in the—</P>
<P><HI>LAST</HI> place, That <HI>Praelatical</HI> Powers were <HI>not</HI> com∣prehended in the <HI>Apostles</HI> ordinary Capacity, nor the Episcopal Throne erected upon the Apostolic Commissi∣on: and so the Diocesan Claim must fall to the ground. For <HI>tho'</HI> Praelates <HI>are not excluded by Name</HI> (to allude to an Observation of our Answerer's — <HI>Def.</HI> pag. 65) <HI>Yet they are, by the Nature of Commissions; all Commissions being exclusive of all but those to whom They are grant∣ed.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have impartially weigh'd the Gentleman's <HI>three Preliminaries, adjusted</HI> 'em, and corrected the undue <HI>Turn of Tho't,</HI> which his Discourse upon them might tend to give such as are looking into <HI>this Controversy:</HI> and hope I have left him no Room to raise any more Dust, on these Topicks, to cloud and darken them.</P>
<P>¶ I proceed now to consider what he has advanc'd on two or three <HI>Texts,</HI> which he wou'd have the World be∣lieve <HI>I have mistaken &amp; misapplied:</HI> and <HI>by setting of which in their true Light,</HI> he says, <HI>all that I have offered, will be fully reply'd to.</HI> He resolves <HI>now to take bold on the Impartial Hand, if it is not too nim∣ble or ill-natured to be taken in its own way.</HI> Well, let him take <HI>what Hold</HI> he pleases, (where &amp; how he will) I hope the <HI>Impartial Hand</HI> will be <HI>nimble</HI> enough to manage him; and that without being so <HI>ill-natur'd</HI> as to offer any foul Play. Let unprejudic'd Standers-by judge between us. To begin then,</P>
<P>§ 1. THE first Text he mentions, is 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1 6. (which speaks of <HI>the putting on of</HI> Paul<HI>'s Hands</HI>) But is the wrong Text: it should have been 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 4.14. which speaks of <HI>the Laying on of the Hands of the</HI> Presbytery.</P>
<P>AND here the Gentleman, in an Excess of good Na∣ture, (shall I say? or through the force of Conviction)
<PB N="22" REF="002636_0024_0FE5D795AE9A1978"/>
is willing to <HI>take me in my own way, by condemning</HI> Calvin<HI>'s Institutes</HI> [tho' in so doing, as it unhappily falls out, he condemns his own <HI>Defense</HI> of <HI>Mod. Proof,</HI> (pag. 28.) which interprets the word <HI>Presbytery,</HI> of the <HI>Office transferred on</HI> Timothy, <HI>at his Ordination by St.</HI> Paul's own Hands,] and <HI>admitting</HI> my <HI>Comment on the Text,</HI> viz. <HI>That</HI> Timothy <HI>was ordain'd by a College of Presby∣ters. But then,</HI> he tells me <HI>I must grant also, that those</HI> Presbyters <HI>were either</HI> Apostles, <HI>or meer single</HI> Presbyters, <HI>and</HI> Paul <HI>presiding among them in either case.</HI></P>
<P><HI>IF the First,</HI> then he concludes, <HI>his Point is gained; for</HI> (says he) <HI>the Apostles were not only</HI> Presbyters, <HI>but</HI> Bishops <HI>also in the full and strictest Sense of the word, by the third Preliminary; and this will save the Credit and the Evidence of the first Epistle to</HI> Timothy <HI>for Episcopacy, and be exactly agreeable to the practice of the Church of</HI> England.</P>
<P>To which I answer,</P>
<P N="1">1. THAT, by <HI>Presbytery</HI> here, to understand a number of <HI>Apostles,</HI> joyning with <HI>Paul,</HI> in the Ordination of <HI>Timothy,</HI> is very <HI>irrational.</HI> 'Tis an Exposition intirely Conjectural, and carries not the least shadow of <HI>Probabi∣lity</HI> with it.</P>
<P>FOR (besides other Reasons) it is extreme unlikely that <HI>Paul</HI> should bestow on a College of <HI>Apostles</HI> no higher Denomination than this of <HI>a Presbytery:</HI> and then (agreeably to what I observ'd in <HI>Append.</HI> to <HI>Sob. Rem.</HI> pag. 18. — tho' my <HI>Animadverter</HI> has made no Re∣turn to me upon it) 'tis equally improbable, that <HI>Paul</HI> (so humble an Apostle) should have the Vanity to <HI>dis∣tinguish</HI> himself from his Brethren, and <HI>exalt</HI> himself above them, in the manner our Opponents make him to do, by the Sense they put upon 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> 1.6. where they suppose him to affirm, <HI>That</HI> Timothy <HI>was</HI> ordained <HI>by the Laying on of</HI> His <HI>Hands;</HI> as if it were his <HI>Sole Act,</HI> and the whole Virtue and Efficacy flow'd from <HI>his</HI> Hand. Which if it be true, I cannot imagine Them to be <HI>Apostles,</HI> that are meant by <HI>the Presbytery:</HI> For the Apostles were all <HI>equally</HI> vested with ordaining Power:
<PB N="23" REF="002636_0025_0FE5D738597B1240"/>
And it would not be consistent with the usual <HI>Modesty</HI> and <HI>Humility</HI> of this Apostle's Language, in all other Cases, when speaking of Himself, for him to use such a Speech in this Case, as excludes the Rest of his Brethren from any share in the Ordination of <HI>Timothy;</HI> which must be judg'd very vain, as well as false.</P>
<P>However,</P>
<P N="2">2. ADMIT that by <HI>the Presbytery</HI> is meant a College of <HI>Apostles,</HI> yet my <HI>Animadverter</HI> is very short in his Reasoning, and labours of a grand Mistake, when he con∣cludes <HI>his Point to be gain'd thereby:</HI> nor will that Con∣cession at all hurt the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Claim and Argument from the Text under Consideration.</P>
<P>FOR thus I argue upon the present Hypothesis: These Apostles acted in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination, either in their ordinary or extraordinary Capacity. <HI>Not</HI> in their <HI>extra-ordinary;</HI> for then it affords no Example or Argument for Ordination by <HI>ordinary</HI> Officers. Whereas, on all sides it is allow'd and pleaded as a <HI>sufficient Warrant</HI> for Ordination by ordinary Officers: — therefore it was their <HI>ordinary Capacity</HI> in which they ordained. And hence they who <HI>succeed</HI> the Apostles in their whole <HI>ordi∣nary Capacity,</HI> must be entituled to the Power of Ordi∣nation.</P>
<P>NOW here lies the Difficulty, to know <HI>who</HI> are their proper Successors: which can be determin'd only by in∣quiring <HI>what</HI> the <HI>Apostles</HI> in their ordinary Capacity were; what Powers they had, and what Acts they did. And for our Information here we must look into their <HI>Commission,</HI> and into their <HI>History:</HI> both whereof have been already consulted; and it appears from them, That the Apostles, considered in their ordinary Capacity, were only <HI>Presbyters.</HI> This has been made evident from the Ac∣counts of <HI>Fact</HI> and the Practice of the Apostles: And it is a most genuine Deduction from the <HI>original Charter,</HI> given them by our Lord, that describes their <HI>Work,</HI> in the <HI>superior</HI> and <HI>main</HI> permanent branches of it, and pre∣scribes nothing expresly but what is the allow'd &amp; undoubt∣ed Duty of ordinary <HI>Ministers</HI> or <HI>Pastors:</HI> which affords
<PB N="24" REF="002636_0026_0FE5D75DD13CCFB0"/>
a strong presumptive Argument, that the <HI>Apostles,</HI> in their ordinary and abiding Character, were really but <HI>Presbyters.</HI> Therefore all those who are truly ordain'd to the Office of <HI>Presbyters,</HI> do succeed to the <HI>Apostles</HI> in the <HI>full Extent</HI> of their ordinary Capacity, and are to be look'd upon as invested with the Plenitude of their ministerial and continuing Powers: One of which being <HI>Ordination,</HI> this necessary <HI>Inference</HI> plainly arises, and forceably urges our Assent, <HI>That Presbyters have the Ordaining Power committed to them,</HI> and lodg'd in their Hands, as <HI>their Peculiar,</HI> exclusively (in common Cases at least) of all others not rightly ordain'd to the Office of Presbyters, and so not truly sustaining the ordinary Character of the Apostles.— Upon the whole then it appears, We offer no <HI>Injury</HI> at all to the Plea for <HI>Pres∣byterian</HI> Ordination, taken from <HI>the Laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery,</HI> although we allow this to refer to a Company of <HI>Apostles:</HI> Because it must be granted, if they were Apostles, They ordain'd by virtue of their <HI>ordinary Power,</HI> which I've prov'd amounted to no more than that of <HI>Presbyters.</HI></P>
<P>INDEED my <HI>Animadverter</HI> tells us, <HI>The Apostles were not only Presbyters, but</HI> Bishops <HI>also in the full &amp; strictest Sense of the Word.</HI> To which I reply; If he intends here the <HI>sound</HI> Sense of the Word, as us'd in <HI>Scripture,</HI> I have nothing to object. But, I think, invincible Objecti∣ons lie in the way, if he intends the modern <HI>Ecclesiastical</HI> Sense of the Word. For, <HI>thus</HI> taken, it is applicable to none but <HI>Diocesan Prelates;</HI> whom the Animadverter describes (<HI>pag.</HI> 10.) as those that have in them <HI>the Power of Ordination, and Jurisdiction over a Plurality of Presbyters, and Churches, annexed,</HI> and <HI>are</HI> settled <HI>in their respective</HI> SEES. Now I desire to know whether He will apply <HI>this</HI> Definition to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and so make them <HI>Bishops</HI> in the <HI>full</HI> and <HI>strictest</HI> Sense of the Word, as us'd by the <HI>Moderns.</HI> And after he has resolv'd us on this head, I must give him the further Trouble of producing some good Evidence, that the <HI>modern Ecclesi∣astical Use</HI> of the Word is agreeable to the <HI>Scripture-Sense</HI> of it: Because for my own part, after my best In∣quiries
<PB N="25" REF="002636_0027_0FE5D7A2F602BC88"/>
I cannot light of any one place in all the <HI>New Testament,</HI> where the word is us'd in the <HI>modern Prelati∣cal</HI> Sense, to mean a Church-Officer vested with <HI>Jurisdic∣tion over a Plurality of Churches and their Pastors:</HI> but find it every where necessarily to be understood in the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Sense, as convertible with the word <HI>Pastor, Teacher, Elder</HI> &amp;c. Yea, the Names of <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter</HI> are <HI>promiscuously</HI> apply'd to the <HI>same Persons,</HI> in several places: <HI>which</HI> Persons do, by the De∣scription of their Essential <HI>Qualifications,</HI> and by the <HI>Works</HI> and <HI>Offices</HI> assign'd 'em, in those places, evidently appear to be the <HI>Pastors</HI> and Overseers of <HI>particular</HI> Congregations: As the <HI>Remarker</HI> has excellently argu'd; whose Reasonings on these Heads are (I think) the most clear and strong that I ever met with, and do make the <HI>Inference</HI> from a Community of <HI>Names</HI> (in this case) to an Identity of <HI>Office,</HI> and from the <HI>undistinguish'd</HI> Appli∣cations of the same <HI>Character</HI> and <HI>indifferent</HI> Injunctions of the same <HI>Work,</HI> unto the <HI>Sameness</HI> of <HI>Order,</HI> appear very good and genuine. And I presume, neither the Light of his Arguings is obscur'd, nor the Force of his Consequences at all enervated, by any thing the <HI>Defender</HI> of the <HI>Mod. Proof</HI> has been able to offer.</P>
<P>WE may then allow the <HI>Apostles</HI> to be <HI>Bishops,</HI> in the <HI>full</HI> and <HI>strictest</HI> Sense of the Word, as us'd in <HI>Scrip∣ture,</HI> and yet our <HI>Animadverter</HI> gain no Advantage by it; because that is but to allow 'em to be <HI>Presbyters:</HI> seeing <HI>Bishop</HI> and <HI>Presbyter</HI> are in Scripture-Use <HI>Synoni∣mous.</HI></P>
<P>YEA, we may call 'em Bishops in the <HI>modern Ecclesi∣astical</HI> Sense, as having <HI>Jurisdiction</HI> over <HI>Presbyters</HI> and <HI>Churches;</HI> and yet the <HI>Gentleman</HI> will gain nothing by it, to serve the Cause of <HI>Prelacy:</HI> because such a superin∣tending Power cou'd not belong to Them, in their <HI>ordi∣nary</HI> Capacity, <HI>merely</HI> as <HI>stated Commission-Officers;</HI> but must be exercised by <HI>them</HI> in their <HI>extraordinary</HI> Capaci∣ty, as <HI>Divinely inspir'd</HI> Ministers, under an <HI>infallible</HI> Conduct of the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> and endow'd with <HI>Superna∣tural Powers.</HI> [Which I have said enough to prove, both in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> and in this <HI>Vindication.</HI>] Therefore al∣tho'

And indeed the Ordaining Power of <HI>Presbyters</HI> re∣ceives a great deal of Countenance from the Style of our Text, where this supposed College of Apostles are deno∣minated a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> which plainly hints their acting (in <HI>Timothy's</HI> Ordination) under the Character and Quality of <HI>Presbyters.</HI> And however light any may make of an <HI>Inference,</HI> from the Use of that <HI>Phrase,</HI> in favour of Or∣dination by <HI>Presbyters;</HI> yet (as I observ'd in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> pag. 19.) at least there is so good <HI>Colour</HI> for such an In∣ference, that if it had been said, <HI>By the Laying on of the Hands of the Assembly of</HI> Bishops, I doubt not, our <HI>Oppo∣nents</HI> would have made great Improvement of it, would have deem'd the Text <HI>Conclusive,</HI> and a full Confutation of the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Hypothesis. — But however that be, it is clear from the Premises, that our <HI>Animadverter</HI> must <HI>lose his Point,</HI> even tho' we <HI>take him in his own way, by admitting his Comment on the Text, That</HI> Timothy <HI>was ordain'd by a College of Apostles:</HI> And if <HI>the Credit and the Evidence of the first Epistle to</HI> Tim. <HI>for Episcopacy,</HI> depends on this Text, <HI>that</HI> is lost too.</P>
<P>IN short, let him consider the Text in what Light he pleases; whether as referring to Apostles, or to ordinary Ministers, he will never be able, by the most finish'd Ar∣tifice in Logick he is Master of, to wrest it to his pur∣pose; but either way it will be the Confusion of his Cause.
<PB N="27" REF="002636_0029_0FE5D7A7B34D8B80"/>
Let him torture the Text ever so much, I am persuad∣ed, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e'll never make it confess to his Notions. As for the First Sense, enough has been said.</P>
<P>LET us now hear what he offers, with respect to the <HI>other</HI> Construction.</P>
<P><HI>IF the Second,</HI> says he, (that is, if the word <HI>Presbyte∣ry</HI> be taken for a number of <HI>Pastors</HI> or Parish-Presbyters, then <HI>It is plain, that</HI> Paul <HI>alone conferred the Gift, that is, the Office and the Power of executing it, —and that the</HI> Presbyters <HI>only gave their Assent, it being impossible in the nature of the thing, that the</HI> Presby∣ters <HI>could have any other Influence on the Act.</HI></P>
<P>BUT let it be observ'd here: The Gentleman has for∣got (what I intimated in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> and what many learned Men do agree to, <HI>viz.</HI>) That it's probable, <HI>Paul</HI>'s putting on of his Hands was not in <HI>Conjunction</HI> with the <HI>Presbytery,</HI> but at a <HI>distinct Time,</HI> and upon a different Design; his Imposition of Hands being in order to the Gift of the Holy Ghost, and theirs for Ordination, and so might be at <HI>several</HI> Times. Or, as I hinted in the <HI>Appendix</HI> (p. 9.) They might both respect <HI>Ordination,</HI> and yet not be at the same Time; if our Opponents be in the Right on't about <HI>Re-ordination.</HI> For so, <HI>Timothy</HI> might be ordained first a <HI>Presbyter</HI> by the <HI>Presbytery</HI> alone, and afterwards a <HI>Bishop</HI> by <HI>Paul.</HI> And if my Animad∣verter had given us his Thoughts on this, He would have much oblig'd us.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, I will take the Gentleman in his <HI>own way,</HI> and will suppose them to be at the <HI>same Juncture,</HI> and upon the <HI>same Occasion.</HI> Yet, I trust, this will not any whit d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sserve my Cause.</P>
<P>AS to <HI>Paul's</HI> presiding in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination, if this must be affirmed <HI>in either Case,</HI> as the Animadverter observes; I wou'd observe further, It must be own'd o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>equal</HI> weight in <HI>both Cases,</HI> and so may as well be made use of in Objection to Ordination by <HI>Bishops</HI> (the <HI>Apostles</HI> pretended Successors) <HI>without a Superior,</HI> as a∣gainst Ordination, by <HI>Presbyters,</HI> without a <HI>Superior.</HI> —
<PB N="28" REF="002636_0030_0FE59B59E629A740"/>
But, I think, <HI>Paul</HI>'s Presidency in <HI>either</HI> Case, imported no more than the Power and Province of a <HI>Moderator,</HI> appointed for Order's sake. In the <HI>first</HI> Case, or upon Supposition They were <HI>Apostles,</HI> who joyned in Lay∣ing on of Hands, I am prone to believe my <HI>Animadver∣ter</HI> will ascribe nothing more to Him, seeing They <HI>all</HI> had an inherent Power of ordaining as well as he. And why <HI>any more</HI> should be ascribed to him in the <HI>other</HI> Case, or supposing them to be <HI>Presbyters,</HI> I cannot divine. For, that <HI>Paul</HI> lay'd on Hands (under his <HI>common</HI> No∣tion) as a <HI>Presbyter,</HI> and not under any <HI>distinctive</HI> Charac∣ter, as a <HI>superior</HI> Officer, or <HI>Head,</HI> is a Consequence very fairly deducible from the chosen <HI>Style</HI> of the Text; where he speaks of the whole Consistory of Ordainers, as a <HI>Presbytery,</HI> taking in <HI>Himself</HI> among the Rest, without any mark of <HI>Distinction:</HI> which, as it carries with it an Intimation, that <HI>all</HI> the Members of the Body had a pro∣per <HI>Agency</HI> in the Ordination; So it naturally leads us to infer, That <HI>Paul</HI> exerted no more <HI>ordaining</HI> Power than any common Member, and had not the Influence of a supreme <HI>Head,</HI> as some vainly dream. And indeed, if I mistake not, the fix'd notion of a <HI>President</HI> (the Name, my Animadverter applies to the Apostle in this Case) can carry his Power to no higher a pitch than that of a <HI>Moderator,</HI> who (as I hinted before) is constituted only for <HI>order's</HI> sake, and has no more intrinsick Power than any others belonging to the Society.</P>
<P>I might illustrate this to our Animadverter, by the <HI>Consecration</HI> of a <HI>Bishop</HI> in his own Church: in which the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> presides, but yet is only the <HI>Mouth</HI> of the Assembly, and has no more authoritative Influence into the Ordination (by any superior Degree of ordaining Power inherent in him) than the Rest of his <HI>Fellow-Bishops,</HI> that joyn with him in the Action; as appears by the <HI>Form</HI> of Consecration of Bishops, and in that the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> claims no Superiority of <HI>order</HI> to other Pre∣lates, nor indeed any superior <HI>Degree</HI> of Power, as of <HI>Divine Right,</HI> but as arising only out of Ecclesiastical and Civil Laws and Customs. And hence, in <HI>that Case,</HI> the Practice of the Church of <HI>England</HI> is exactly agreeable to the Practice of the Churches of <HI>New England,</HI> in the or∣dination
<PB N="29" REF="002636_0031_0FE5D7A87B91F060"/>
of a Minister; in which we have a <HI>Moderator</HI> to preside, who is of the same Class with the other Pastors.</P>
<P>SO that <HI>Paul</HI>'s Presidency in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination, can afford our Opponents nothing of an Argument to plead against <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Ordinations. And truly (to borrow a Hint from the <HI>Remarker</HI>) <Q>That gives us no more grounds to suspect that the <HI>Presbyters</HI> had not full power and authority to ordain <HI>by themselves,</HI> than it does to suspect whether the <HI>Apostle</HI> had power to or∣dain by himself.</Q> At least it can be no more an ob∣jection against Ordination by <HI>Presbyters</HI> alone (without Bishops) than by <HI>Bishops</HI> alone, without Presbyters. And yet how constantly is this practiced in the Church of <HI>Eng∣land,</HI> in all Consecrations to the <HI>Episcopate!</HI> Here only the <HI>Arch-Bishop,</HI> and <HI>Bishops present,</HI> are concern'd▪ no meer <HI>Presbyters</HI> are admitted to joyn. But how dis∣agr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eable this, to <HI>Scripture Example,</HI> in the Consecration of <HI>Timothy,</HI> the supposed Bishop of <HI>Ephesus?</HI> Indeed my Animadverter observes, if they were <HI>Apostles,</HI> who laid their hands with <HI>Paul</HI>'s on <HI>Timothy,</HI> this <HI>will be ex∣actly agreeable to the Church of</HI> England.— But then, he has been so uncautious, as nor to offer one single word in proof, that they were <HI>Apostles;</HI> nor indeed has he so much as asserted it: but seems willing to allow, they were only <HI>Presbyters;</HI> as I had argu'd, and I think, prov'd. Hence he has left the way open for one or other of those <HI>Consequences</HI> to take place, that I have pursu'd his Friend with (in my <HI>Appendix,</HI> p. 10, 11) either of which, I think, grate hard enough on him. Tho' I imagin he judges the last to be the most harmless, <HI>viz.</HI> That the Church of <HI>England</HI> has departed from <HI>Scripture-Pattern,</HI> in excluding <HI>Presbyters</HI> from laying on hands in the Ordination of <HI>Bishops;</HI> whence her Prelates must be own'd not <HI>Regularly</HI> consecrated; and so far at least She must look <HI>uncanonical</HI> &amp; <HI>unprimitive,</HI> notwithstand∣ing her boasted Apostolic Constitution.</P>
<P>BUT now to proceed; the great <HI>Objection,</HI> bro't by my Animadverter (and pompously set forth, as what he lays peculiar Stress upon) is taken from <HI>its being im∣possible in the Nature of the thing, that</HI> Presbyters
<PB N="30" REF="002636_0032_0FE5D74F2A2805D0"/>
<HI>shou'd have any other Influence on the Act, than only to give their Assent.</HI>— This, I must confess, has two Circumstances to recommend it, — <HI>Novelty</HI> and <HI>Singu∣larity.</HI> 'Tis of a very fresh Date, a perfectly new Thought, a <HI>Proprium</HI> (too) of our Animadverter's; and he shall be allow'd the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> it.

I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eel but repeat his own Words, <HI>mutato nomine,</HI> c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>anging <HI>Presbyters</HI> into <HI>Apostles</HI> or Bi∣shops; and he must be an <HI>Ign<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ramus</HI> indeed, who does not see, or intolerably <HI>wilful</HI> who won't own, that the Objection carries as much Force in the one Case, as in the other; tho' indeed in both Cases, it is manifestly big with Absurdity, and must needs sink and perish under its heavy Burden — Well, with that Alteration, the Argu∣ment runs thus:</P>
<P><HI>IF the Gift conferred was the</HI> Holy Ghost, (<HI>which by the way I do not grant,</HI> says my Animadverter; and which by the way, <HI>say I,</HI> was never asserted by me, con∣cerning the Gift spoken of in 1 <HI>Tim</HI> 4.14. as conferred <HI>with the Laying on of the Hands of the Presbytery:</HI> So that the Gentleman is very much <HI>out</HI> for once, when he pretends <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ere <HI>to take me in my own way.) and if</HI> Paul <HI>alone did not confer it, then every single</HI> Apostle or bishop <HI>did that as well He: and hence it will follow, that the more ordaining</HI> Apostles <HI>or</HI> Bishops <HI>there were, the more of the Holy Ghost did the ordained receive. And in that Case, who would not have coveted to be or∣dain'd by an</HI> oecumenical Council <HI>of them, and with such vast Collations of it such a Person might be fitted also to be</HI> Pastor <HI>of the</HI> oecumenical Church; <HI>and in proporti∣on, those who had fewer Ordainers, had fewer shares in this Gift of the Holy Ghost, and proportionably would be of less use to the Church.</HI></P>
<P><HI>OR, if by Gift be understood the</HI> Office <HI>and the Powers for its Execution, as seems most evident, then if</HI> Paul <HI>did not alone cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> it, it will follow that each ordain∣ing</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="002636_0033_0FE5D7A96D95FBA0"/>
Apostle or Bishop <HI>conferred a Part, or the Whole of this Gift. If a Part, it would gratify the Publick to condescend upon</HI> (alias, instance in) <HI>what Part, or</HI> (say) <HI>how many there must be to make up the Whole. If each Ordaine<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> conferred the whole Gift, then in proportion to their Number, must the Offices be multiply'd; and then instead of one, there might be a Dozen or more Offices conferred, according to the member of Ordainers.</HI></P>
<P>THUS you see the <HI>Animadverter</HI>'s Argument most unluckily recoils in his Face, and turns its Sting into his own Bosom For nothing can be more evident than, if any <HI>Absurdities flow f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>m</HI> my Construction of the Word <HI>Presbytery,</HI> that the <HI>very some</HI> absurd Consequences must inevitably be charg'd on <HI>his</HI> too. And how <HI>extremely silly</HI> (it I may retort his own decent Language) must <HI>He</HI> be, who makes use of such a Way of Arguing to put by <HI>another</HI>'s Comment on a Text, (as if there he any force at all in it) may with equal force be made use of in oppo∣sition to <HI>his own.</HI></P>
<P>BUT that there is <HI>no</HI> Force at all in his Reasoning here, affix what Sense you please to the controverted Word, (take it either for <HI>Apostles,</HI> or for ordinary <HI>Presbyters</HI>) will very plainly appear, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we consider <HI>the Nature of the Action.</HI> Now if my Animadverter will take the Opini∣on of the Author of the <HI>M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d. Proof</HI> (which, methinks, ought to carry some Authority with him, since he has undertaken to be his Defender) be may find that <HI>modest Gentleman</HI> expressing <HI>his</HI> Sense of the Matter, in terms very agreeable, in the 12th <HI>page</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his Book; where he observes that this Ceremony of Prayer and Imposition of Hands was usual in <HI>designing and appointing</HI> Persons to any sacred Office, in <HI>separating,</HI> in <HI>setting apart,</HI> and <HI>investing them</HI>—; all which Phrases he makes use of. Whereas there's nothing here about <HI>conferring the Office and the Powers for its Execution</HI> (according to the Animadverter's Notion) but only the <HI>Designation and Investiture of the Person;</HI> which gives us the <HI>true Na∣ture</HI> of the Action. For that <HI>Power,</HI> which the <HI>Ordain∣ed</HI> receive, is not the <HI>Gift</HI> of their <HI>Ordainers,</HI> but de∣rives

wholly from the <HI>Institution</HI> and <HI>Commission</HI> of CHRIST.

Papism.</HI> p. 199.</NOTE>, <Q>The Apostles laid on their Hands in the ordaining of Bishops or Pastors, but their Office they received of God: That external Rite was only an out∣ward Testimony of the Church, That such Men were marked and sealed of God, for that Office. — This was the outward Sign that God's Spirit had set such Men apart. — This is the outward Approbation and Consent of the Church, which giveth them not their Office, but only corfirmeth it outwardly unto Them.

this Matter, as we have it declared in the <HI>Bock of Ordi∣nation.</HI> The whole Tenor of the <HI>Preface</HI> speaks it very plainly: which makes use of <HI>Consecration,</HI> and <HI>Ordinati∣on,</HI> as convertible and univocal Terms; and describes an authoriz'd Minister, to be such an one as has been <HI>first Called, Tried, Examined, and Known to have such Qualities as are requisite; and also</HI> BY <HI>publick Prayer,</HI> w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <HI>Imp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sition of Hands,</HI> approved <HI>and</HI> admitted <HI>to his Office by some lawful Authority.</HI> And if we look into the <HI>Forms</HI> themselves, we shall find them all speaking the same Language. Thus particularly in <HI>the ordering of Priests,</HI> the Bishop over and over <HI>recognizes</HI> the Person's <HI>Divine Call</HI> to the Ministry, before he imposes Hands on him: And <HI>Ordination</HI> is there continually spoken of in such Terms as only imply an <HI>Allowance</HI> of his preceeding Call, and solemn <HI>Admission</HI> of him to the public <HI>Exer∣cise</HI> of the <HI>Office,</HI> which he has already a <HI>Right</HI> unto, by his Divine <HI>Call.</HI> Indeed, at the Imposition of Hands, our <HI>Saviour's Words</HI> are repeated, <HI>Receive the Holy Ghost</HI> &amp;c. But (if Bishop <HI>Burnet</HI>'s Account of the Matter may be accepted <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vid. <HI>Pastor. Care.</HI> p. 95. Edit. 4.</NOTE>) The Church, by making our <HI>Saviour's</HI> <Q><HI>Words</HI> the Form of Ordination, must be construed to intend, that it is <HI>Christ only</HI> that sends, and that the <HI>Bishops</HI> are only his <HI>Ministers</HI> to pronounce <HI>his</HI> Mis∣sion; otherwise it is not easy to justify the use of this Form, <HI>Receive the Holy Ghost:</HI> which as it was not used in the Primitive Church, nor by the <HI>Roman,</HI> till within these 500 Years, so in that Church it is not the Form of Ordination, but a Benediction given by the <HI>Bishop</HI> singly, after the Orders are given by the <HI>Bishop</HI> and the other <HI>Priests</HI> joyning with him: For this is done by him alone, as the final Consummation of the Action. But <HI>our</HI> using this as the Form of Ordination, shews that we consider ourselves only as the <HI>Instru∣ments</HI> that speak in <HI>Christ's</HI> Name and Words; in si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u∣ating that <HI>He</HI> only ordains. Pursuant to this, in the ordaining of <HI>Priests,</HI> the Questions are put <HI>in the Name of God and of his Church,</HI> which makes the Answers to them to be of the Nature of <HI>Vows</HI> and <HI>Oaths.—

Orders</HI> are of the Nature of a <HI>Covenant</HI> between <HI>Christ</HI> and the <HI>Clerks;</HI> in which so many Privileges and Pow∣ers are granted on the one part, and so many Duties and Offices are promised on the other<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Pag. 103.</NOTE>. <HI>Ordination</HI> is the Consummation of this <HI>Compact</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Pag. 106.</NOTE>.</Q> — And from the same learned Hand, we have it; That the <Q>Forms of Ordination in the <HI>Greek</HI> Church, which we have Reason to believe are less changed, and more con∣form to the Primitive Patterns, than those used by the <HI>Latins,</HI> do plainly import, that the Church only <HI>declared</HI> the Divine Vocation: — <HI>The Grace of God that perfects the Feeble, and heals the Weak, promot∣eth this Man to be a Deacon, a Priest, or a Bishop.</HI> Where nothing is express'd as <HI>conferred,</HI> but only as <HI>declared</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pag. 95.</NOTE>. So our Church (saith the Bishop) by making our Saviour's Words the Form of Ordination, must be construed to intend —.</Q> Now as He ob∣serves <NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot">Pag. 91.</NOTE>, <Q>The truest Indication of the Sense of a Church, is to be taken from her Language in her <HI>publick Offi∣ces.</HI></Q> And therefore I have made use of this way of Reasoning, on this Occasion, and I hope it will appear with great Advantage, and minister Conviction.</P>
<P>IT is plain, the <HI>Ordainers</HI> do not <HI>confer</HI> the Power, but only <HI>confirm,</HI> approve, invest, and the like. They are at most but Instruments of Conveyance, or rather of <HI>Con∣firmation</HI> and publick Installment. As in Civil Cases, when the <HI>Arch-Bishop</HI> performs the Ceremony of <HI>Coro∣nation▪</HI> the <HI>King</HI> does not derive the <HI>Regal Authority</HI> from <HI>Him</HI> in the least. So when my Lord <HI>Chancellor</HI> seals a <HI>Patent, he</HI> gives no Power at all. So the <HI>Mayor</HI> of a City derives all his Power from the <HI>Prince</HI>'s Charter, and not at all from the <HI>Recorder</HI> or <HI>Steward,</HI> who performs the Ceremony of Inauguration. Which Things may very, much help to adjust and settle our Notions of Ecclesiastical <HI>Ordination:</HI> And we may call it a public <HI>Recognition,</HI> and Attestation, or solemn Inauguration and Investiture.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="002636_0037_0FE5D7B91E7954A0"/>THUS I have given you a rational Account of the Na∣ture of <HI>Ordination,</HI> from some of the Writers, and Pub∣lick Formula's of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and illustrated the Matter by various Similitudes. I've insisted on this Point the longer, because my <HI>Animadverter</HI>'s mistake about the <HI>Nature of the Action</HI> [as if it were the <HI>Con∣ferring an Office, and Giving the Powers for its Execu∣tion</HI>] is what I apprehend to be the <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>, the grand Fallacy in his Scheme. Do but rectify this, and matters will come to Rights. Let him get this Notion once out of his Head, and entertain those <HI>just Idea's</HI> that his own Church and his Brethren have formed for him; and it must needs go a great way towards convincing him, that <HI>Presbyters</HI> are capable and very proper Persons to perform the business of Ordination: at least I'm persuaded, He'll never more imagine it <HI>impossible</HI> for a <HI>Plurality</HI> to ordain together, nor ever again attempt to <HI>demonstrate it to be so from the Nature of the Thing.</HI> For, what is there in the <HI>Nature of the Action,</HI> as it has now been describ'd, that should speak it <HI>impossible</HI> to be perform'd by a Number of Persons in Conjunction? Where is the Difficulty? Whence the Absurdity? Is it impossible for a <HI>Society</HI> to make <HI>one Prayer, and one De∣claration,</HI> and the like, <HI>together?</HI> I pray, why may not a <HI>Community</HI> of Pastors separate and ordain a <HI>Minister,</HI> as well as a <HI>College of Physicians</HI> approbate and licence one of <HI>their</HI> Profession, as the known Custom is!</P>
<P>BUT now for once I am willing to drop the Notion I have bee<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> contending for, and allow that the Ordainers do not merely <HI>recognize</HI> the Authority given by Christ's Charter, but really <HI>confer</HI> the Office and the Powers for its Execution, (as my Animadverter words himself) yet I can't see but that <HI>This</HI> is very reconcilable with a <HI>Plu∣rality</HI> of Ordainers, It's observable, When the <HI>Deacons</HI> Office was instituted, and a Number of Persons <HI>appointed over this Business,</HI> (as we read <HI>Act.</HI> 6.) all the <HI>Twelve</HI> Apostles concurred in it. And among all the <HI>Ordinati∣ons</HI> we have an Account of, in the <HI>Acts</HI> of the <HI>Apostles,</HI> I don't remember any Instance of Ordination but by a <HI>Plurality</HI> of Hands: which is pretty wonderful, if it be so impossible for more than <HI>one</HI> particular H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd to con∣vey

the Power. — But what a So oecism is this! How ridiculous the Notion, if we apply it to other Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es! I fancy, the <HI>Roman Senate</HI> could grant a single Commission as well as the <HI>Roman Emperor.</HI> And I pray, Could <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot King <HI>William</HI> and Queen <HI>Mary</HI> (or immortal Memo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y) give <HI>one</HI> Royal Charter <HI>in Conjunction<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l</HI> Or, our Natio∣nal <HI>Laws,</HI> are they not the Result of a numerous and <HI>mix'd</HI> Legislature, <HI>King, Lords,</HI> and <HI>Commons,</HI> being <HI>joyntly</HI> the Enacting Power of the Nation! This is the <HI>English</HI> Constitution: And is there any <HI>Absurdity</HI> in it! Is it <HI>impossible</HI> in the Nature of the Thing, that such a Constitution should be acted upon! Or will Mr. Animad∣verter say, the Supreme Power must necessarily be vested in the <HI>sole</HI> Person of the <HI>Prince,</HI> and that there can be no proper Government but an <HI>absolute Monarchy!</HI> I hope no <HI>Englishman</HI> among us, and at this time o' day especially, will advance a Principle, which if carry'd into it's just Consequences, will appear so swell'd with Reproach to the happy <HI>Revolution,</HI> as well as a glaring Affront to the Wisdom of our Nation, and to the common Reason of Mankind. — Indeed I should not be much surpris'd, if my <HI>Animadverter</HI> shou'd espouse that Highflown No∣tion; since on the head of Ecclesiastical <HI>Ordination.</HI> He is so very Chimerical in his Talk: pretending as not were <HI>demonstrable even from the Nature of the Action, that if they were</HI> Presbyters, <HI>who laid their Hands with</HI> Paul's <HI>on</HI> Timothy they could not do it as Ordainers, but <HI>it could be only to express their Consent</HI> to the Action. Truly it's all over a Visionary Flight, mere Amusement! You have seen, that there's nothing at all in the Nature of the Action (take it in what View you will) to render it impossible for a Plurality to ordain together: And con∣sequently nothing to exclude the <HI>Presbytery</HI> from having a Hand in <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Ordination, as well as <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>BUT since the Gentleman is for an Argument from <HI>the Nature of the Action,</HI> I must observe to him, that <HI>Imposition of Hands</HI> has always been look'd upon as an <HI>ordaining Act,</HI> and importing an ordaining Power, in the Person perform∣ing it. Insomuch that it is commonly thought the Apostle expresses the whole Business o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Ordination by this sacred Rite, 1 Tim. 5.22. <HI>Lay Hands suddenly
<PB N="37" REF="002636_0039_0FE5D7B9F36610D8"/>
on no Men.</HI> And hence our Opponents urge this Text, in favour of <HI>Timothy</HI>'s Episcopacy. Which they would not do, if the <HI>Laying on of Hands</HI> were not judg'd an invariable <HI>Rite of Consecration.</HI> And has not Dr. <HI>Cave</HI> (a learned Antiquary, whose Authority with the true Sons of the Church, is become almost indisputable) told us, <HI>That Imposition of Hands has been constantly us'd as the Rite of conferring</HI> Ordination <HI>upon the Mi∣nisters of Christ!</HI> — When, I pray, was this Ceremony ever us'd <HI>only to express Assent</HI> to an Ordination? And would our Animadverter allow mere <HI>Laymen</HI> to use this Ceremony, for that end! Which perhaps they might inno∣cently enough do, it it may be used at all for that end. Methinks, had the Presbyters been mere <HI>Consenters,</HI> an audible <HI>Amen</HI> at the close of the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s Prayer, or <HI>giving the Right Hand</HI> to <HI>Timothy,</HI> after his Ordination, would have sufficiently answer'd the End, without their <HI>Laying on Hands</HI> with <HI>Paul,</HI> which (besides the needless Trouble to them) would be likely to prove a Snare in future times, by leading <HI>Presbyters</HI> into bold Pretences under Colour of a primitive Example. Hence we may well think the <HI>Apostle</HI> (that wise Master-Builder) would not have allow'd the <HI>Presbyters</HI> to join with him in Imposition of Hands, unless they had been really vested with the Power of Ordination, as well as he:—Agreeable to what I sug∣gested in the <HI>Appendix,</HI> (pag. 11, 12.) tho' my <HI>Respon∣dent</HI> has not thought it worth his Notice. Neither has he made any Remarks on my 13th <HI>page,</HI> where I have ar∣gued upon his own Hypothesis of <HI>Paul</HI>'s being the <HI>sole Ordainer</HI> (in Exclusion of the <HI>Presbytery</HI>) That never∣theless this Text will not serve the Cause of <HI>Prelacy:</HI> Because that from an <HI>Apostle</HI>'s, to a <HI>Bishop</HI>'s, assuming the whole Power in Ordination (exclusive of the <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> imposing Hands with him) there is no rational Inference, not so much as the face of one; Since Bishops pretend not to succeed the Apostles in any other than their <HI>ordinary</HI> Capacity (in which also Presbyters do equal∣ly succeed them) and <HI>Paul</HI> cannot reasonably be supposed to have ordain'd in <HI>that</HI> Capacity, if the whole Virtue of the Act lay in the Touch of <HI>his</HI> Hand.—I must not enlarge

here. Please to turn to the <HI>Appendix</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pag.</HI> 13, 22, 23, 25, 29 &amp;c.</NOTE>, and I doubt not you may gather up very convincing Proofs, to support this Argument.</P>
<P>BUT to bring the Dispute to an Issue; if we should let all the foregoing Arguments pass for nothing, yet one thing I have to add, that must needs silence my Animid∣verter: I mean the <HI>declared Sense</HI> of his <HI>own Church,</HI> which we shall find to be full <HI>against</HI> Him, if we consult the <HI>Form of Ordination of Priests.</HI> For thus run the Words at the laying on of the Hands of the <HI>Bishop,</HI> and the <HI>Priests</HI> present — <HI>Receive the Holy Ghost for the Office and Work of a Priest in the Church of God, new committed unto Thee by the Imposition of</HI> OUR <HI>Hands.</HI> — You see there is a <HI>Plurality</HI> of Ordainers, and the <HI>Presbyters</HI> are associated with the <HI>Bishop</HI> in the Action, as laying on their Hands for the <HI>same End,</HI> without any Distinction. So that the <HI>Church of England</HI> her self looks on the <HI>Presbyters,</HI> joyning with the Bishop in laying on of Hands, as being active or influential in the sacred <HI>Investiture;</HI> owns their ordaining Power, and doth not make their Concurrence with the Bishop such an insignificant <HI>Cypher,</HI> such an impertinent Ceremony, as our <HI>Animadverter</HI>'s Principles infer it to be. I can∣not then but look upon this Gentleman as flying in the face of his <HI>Mother</HI> the Church of <HI>England,</HI> when he de∣nys the ordaining Power of Presbyters; and as loading his <HI>Fathers,</HI> the Bishops, with the Imputation of a grand Absurdity, in their saying to the Priest ordained, —<HI>Receive the Holy Ghost for the Work now committed to Thee by the Imposition of</HI> OUR <HI>Hands;</HI> — when he asserts it to be <HI>impossible,</HI> in the Nature of the Thing, for a <HI>Plurality</HI> to have a joynt Interest or Instrumentality in the ministerial Conveyance of the Priests Office. And how his <HI>Episcopal</HI> Brethren will relish it, I do not know: but this I know, That they have <HI>just Grounds</HI> to resent it, as a very gross affront offer'd 'em by him, in thus put∣ting such a contemptuous Interpretation upon their Con∣currence with the Bishop, as if it were a needless and
<PB N="39" REF="002636_0041_0FE5D7414C5FBD68"/>
empty <HI>Formality,</HI> and of no real Significancy, as to the matter of Ordination, any more than if a number of <HI>Dea∣cons</HI> joyn'd, or than it so many mere <HI>Laymen</HI> put on their unhallow'd Hands. — And now I leave him to the <HI>Cor∣rection</HI> of his Brethren; who, if they should take him to Task, would perhaps use him with greater <HI>Soverity</HI> than I care at present to do. — But here let my Defense of the <HI>first Text</HI> conclude: which, tho' it may have been longer than was <HI>necessary;</HI> yet, I hope, not longer than will be <HI>profitable.</HI> What remains, shall be studiously drawn into a narrower Compass.</P>
<P>§ 2. I proceed now to the Vindication of the <HI>second Text,</HI> viz. <HI>Acts</HI> 13. <HI>begin.</HI> Where we find <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> separated to their Ministry among the <HI>Gen∣tiles,</HI> by the Hands of certain <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> at <HI>Antioch.</HI></P>
<P>NOW I took these Men to be <HI>Presbyters;</HI> and laid it down, That <HI>we have h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>re an Instance of Ordination by such as were neither Apostles nor Diocesans.</HI> But I did not stand to <HI>prove</HI> their Character, because I thought there was enough observ'd in the <HI>Sob. Remarks</HI> (pag. 116. <HI>Edit.</HI> 2.) to which my Performance was design'd as an <HI>Appendix;</HI> Enough, I say, to prevent all Cavils upon that head, from any one that should undertake a proper Defense of the <HI>Mod. Proof.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Animadverter</HI> blows upon my Notion, and won't allow me the Supposition. He tells us, <HI>The Asser∣tion appears plainly false:</HI> While yet he has been able to bring no better Evidence, than a bare Conjecture [pure∣ly his own too] which at best can only conclude it <HI>possible</HI> to be so. And he says <HI>he cannot believe us, when the Assertion appears plainly false.</HI> Truly he must be one of a very <HI>odd</HI> Make, if he <HI>cou'd:</HI> very few in the World have attained to <HI>believe</HI> what <HI>appears</HI> to 'em <HI>plainly false.</HI> All that <HI>we</HI> desire, is, that he would believe us, when the Assertion appears plainly <HI>true:</HI> As I hope it will <HI>in the present Case,</HI> after I have consider'd the Proof he
<PB N="40" REF="002636_0042_0FE5D7C3392787E0"/>
brings to make it appear false. Which we have in these Words▪ — <HI>For in that Text we find Persons there of a superiour Character to meer</HI> Presbyters, <HI>and yet only there said to be</HI> Prophets <HI>and</HI> Teachers; <HI>for it's certain</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Barnabas <HI>were</HI> Apostles, <HI>and as such of a superi∣our Character to meer</HI> Presbyters, <HI>and no Reason can be given to question it in the others, for</HI> Bishops <HI>not being always mention'd under the Title of their highest Office and Order, it will not follow, that tho' sometimes named under the Character of their lowest Order, that they have no higher; and therefore it will follow, that if</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Barnabas <HI>were (notwithstanding their being called there</HI> Prophets <HI>and</HI> Teachers) <HI>really</HI> Apostles <HI>or</HI> Bishops, <HI>that the others were also really such, tho' with them also mentioned under inferiour Characters.</HI></P>
<P>I have set down his Argument here at length, that you may see the whole Force it carrys in Bar to my Charac∣ter of those Ordainers: And I must confess, if he had not put his Conclusion in such <HI>strong</HI> Terms (but instead of <HI>really were,</HI> had said, <HI>might be</HI>) it would have been the most handsom <HI>Evasion</HI> that I ever met with on this head. But that it is <HI>only</HI> an Evasion, a thin Sophism, and con∣tains nothing of solid Reason, I hope will (upon a cool debate of the Matter) appear, even to <HI>his own</HI> impartial Reflections. Here then to put it in it's genuine Light,</P>
<P N="1">1. LET us try how <HI>this way</HI> of Reasoning will hold in <HI>other Cases</HI> of the <HI>like Nature.</HI></P>
<P>FOR Instance; Suppose the Government of the Colo∣ny of <HI>Rhode-Island</HI> (which I particularly mention, for a good Reason) were spoken of, and their Names set down in some public Records; — but all under the common Style of <HI>Magistrates</HI> and <HI>Rulers:</HI> Would our Animad∣verter now, because he finds a <HI>Governour</HI> and <HI>Deputy-Governour</HI> among Them, hence conclude them <HI>all</HI> to be of such superior Characters? How absurd! How ridi∣culous!</P>
<P>BUT a Scripture-Instance may perhaps be more agree∣able. We have one in 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.5. Where we find <HI>Paul</HI>
<PB N="41" REF="002636_0043_0FE5D7420FB61840"/>
and <HI>Apollos</HI> spoken of together under the general Name of <HI>Ministers.</HI> Now <HI>it is certain,</HI> Paul <HI>was an</HI> Apostle, <HI>and as such of a superior Character to a meer</HI> Presbyter; <HI>and yet is only said there to be a</HI> Minister. But will my Animadverter add in this Case. — <HI>and no Reason can be given to question it in the other Person, though with him also mentioned under an inferior Character!</HI> I hope he won't. For <HI>so</HI> he'll dash against the <HI>Modest Proof,</HI> which calls <HI>Apollo</HI> but a <HI>Pastor,</HI> and ranks him among those of the <HI>inferior Order</HI> (Pag. 29, 30.) Unless then he will contend here with that <HI>Modest Gentleman</HI> (as he calls him) he must own I've brought a parallel Case, in which his way of arguing is very lame and in∣consequential. — But I may mention another Instance we have in <HI>Acts</HI> 15, which is still more clear &amp; parallel, if it be possible. We there read, that <HI>Paul,</HI> and <HI>Barna∣bas,</HI> and <HI>Judas,</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> were at <HI>Antioch</HI> together; and they are all called <HI>Prophets.</HI> Compare <HI>ver.</HI> 30. &amp; 32. —This new comes up full to our Text. But will the <HI>Ani∣madverter</HI>'s way of Reasoning bea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in this Case? No ve∣rily<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> For altho' <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> were Apostles; yet the <HI>other two</HI> were not so. For, in the first place, ob∣serve the Character they have <HI>ver.</HI> 22. <HI>Then pleased it the Apostles and Elders, with the whole Church, to send chosen Men of</HI> their own Company, — Judas <HI>and</HI> Silas, <HI>chief Men among the Brethren.</HI> They belong'd to the Eldership at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and were only <HI>Presbyters,</HI> tho' of chief Note there. But if this doth not satisfy, I hope the Opinion of the Author of <HI>Modest Proof</HI> will: Where we find <HI>Judas</HI> and <HI>Silas,</HI> by Name, spoken of as <HI>Two Presbyters,</HI> and called merely <HI>Ministers of the Word and Sacraments,</HI> and rank'd in <HI>the Order of the Seventy;</HI> said to be <HI>of a distinct Office and Order, and inferior to that of the Apostles.</HI> (Page 14. &amp; 38.)</P>
<P>THESE Instances may suffice to shew how <HI>precarious,</HI> how <HI>ambiguous,</HI> and <HI>illogical,</HI> the Animadverter's way of arguing is; since it will by no means hold, when ap∣ply'd to other Cases of the like Nature. But we must excuse him; for he has used the <HI>best Shift</HI> he cou'd fine

out: and oblig'd he was to invent some very cunning and plausible Elusion, or else to give up his Cause!</P>
<P>AND now I might very fai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly withdraw my Hand, and give over the Consideration of this Text. For, the Business of <HI>Proof</HI> here is incumbent on my <HI>Animadver∣ter,</HI> he being upon the <HI>Affirmative</HI> Side, And since he has not been able to prove his <HI>Assertion,</HI> my <HI>Negative</HI> stands good, and he can't reasonably expect I should labor in the Proof of it. However left my Silence here should be misinterpreted, I will not decline the Task: for I don't despair of Success.</P>
<P N="2">2. THEN, let us see if we can't <HI>make it out,</HI> by some clear and pregnant Proofs, that the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teach∣ers,</HI> who separated <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> were not <HI>Apostles</HI> nor <HI>Diocesans.</HI> This, I think, will appear very plain, and we shall find enough to convince every impar∣tial Inquirer, if we consider the Style of the <HI>Text,</HI> or if we look into the <HI>Context.</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) LET us consider the Language of the <HI>Text,</HI> which runs thus,—<HI>Now there were in the Church that was at Antioch, certain Prophets &amp; Teachers.</HI> In the Original it is— <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>: —which is capable of various Translations, &amp; all accommodable to my purpose. I shall not trouble you with all the different Readings, but will single out two eminent Expositors among the <HI>Animadverter's</HI> own Brethren, to give us the Critical Lection, I mean, Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Whitby.</HI></P>
<P>Dr. <HI>H.</HI> so renders it,— <HI>Now there were Some in An∣tioch.</HI> BELONGING <HI>to the Church that then was, Prophets and Doctors.</HI> — That is, <HI>that then was at Antioch,</HI> as I think the Rules of Construction do oblige us to explain it: altho' the <HI>Doctor</HI> in his Paraphrase stretches the Sense, and takes in <HI>the Churches of</HI> Syria <HI>of that Age,</HI> of which he supposes those Prophets and Teachers to be <HI>Bishops.</HI> Which is a Construction I can't devise what shou'd lead him into, but an odd Notion he was so fond of, as if <HI>Every City had a Bishop, and cou'd have no
<PB N="43" REF="002636_0045_0FE5D7C4DDA1FBB8"/>
more than one.</HI> But I think, <HI>His critical Note,</HI> as I have explain'd it, is preferrable to <HI>his Paraphrase,</HI> and car∣ries abundantly more rational Probability with it. For observe, among those Prophets and Teachers we find <HI>Paul</HI> &amp; <HI>Barnabas,</HI> who cannot with any colour of Rea∣son be called <HI>Bishops</HI> of <HI>Syria.</HI> And then the phrase of the Text is such as speaks it to be a <HI>particular Church,</HI> that those Persons are said to belong unto. For it is, <HI>the Church,</HI> in the singular number; a particular Church; and must (by the most easy &amp; natural Interpretation) mean the Church at <HI>Antioch,</HI> which is mentioned immediately before. Whereas, when <HI>Provinces</HI> and <HI>Countries</HI> are referr'd to, the <HI>Plural</HI> Number is us'd. So we read of <HI>the Churches of</HI> Judea, <HI>the Churches of</HI> Asia, <HI>the Chur∣ches of</HI> Galatia <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And therefore it is very unlikely that the Apostle should refer to the <HI>Churches</HI> of <HI>Syria,</HI> in our Text. But by comparing this with other places of the like Importance, the Case will appear plainer. Thus, 1 Cor. 1.2. <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>—. So in 2 Cor. 1.1 we have the same Words repeated. Which are by the Doctor without any difficulty translated. <HI>To the Church which is at Corinth.</HI> And why by <HI>the Church</HI> in our Text we should not understand, <HI>The Church which is at Antioch,</HI> (notwithstanding a little Trans∣position of the words in our Text) I know of no signifi∣cant Reason. For ought I can see, the Text may very well be read thus.— <HI>Now there were certain Prophets and Teachers belonging to the Church, that was in An∣tioch;</HI> or, <HI>There were Teachers in</HI> Antioch, <HI>belonging to the Church then being,</HI> in that City. I may here allude to some of my Animadverter's Expressions (in another place <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Def.</HI> p. 35.</NOTE>) and say;—<HI>The Sense will not suffer at all by this Translation; There is nothing in the Original that hinders its being exactly so rendered; unless it be the Cause of Episcopacy.</HI></P>
<P>AND correspondent to my Reading is that of Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> who so translates it,—<HI>There were some Pro∣phets and Teachers in Antioch belonging to that Church.</HI> And he vouch<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the learned <HI>Grotius</HI> for it.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="002636_0046_0FE5D7C5A2F50D08"/>IT appears then, in the Judgment of these great Men, that the <HI>Church</HI> spoken of was that at <HI>Antioch;</HI> and it is agreed to by Dr. <HI>Hammond,</HI> that (whatever the Church was) <HI>These Prophets &amp; Teachers did</HI> BELONG <HI>unto it.</HI></P>
<P>NOW it is a fix'd and invariable Maxim, in our Oppo∣nents Scheme,— <HI>But one Bishop in a Church.</HI>—Whereas, here is a <HI>Number</HI> of Teachers, belonging to <HI>one</HI> and the same Church. Therefore they could not be Dio∣cesan <HI>Bishops.</HI> And that they were not in the strict Sense <HI>Apostles,</HI> or of equal Figure with <HI>Paul,</HI> the inspired Doctor of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> I believe my Animadverter him∣self (upon his recollected Thoughts) will readily allow me. Surely he can have no Temptation to suppose them <HI>Apostles</HI> or <HI>Prelates,</HI> save that he finds them <HI>laying on of Hands:</HI> but this carries no Print at all of either Cha∣racter; because it is an Action we find performed by <HI>Presbyters</HI> (as I have shewn before) in the Ordination of <HI>Timothy,</HI> &amp; in the Ordinations of his own Church.</P>
<P>BUT here enters in upon me an Objection, that seems to lie against the Construction of our Text, given above, making those <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> to <HI>belong</HI> unto the Church at <HI>Antioch:</HI> And we may imagin our Animad∣verter to be laying it down thus,—</P>
<P>Obj. <HI>WELL but</HI> Paul <HI>and</HI> Barnabas <HI>were among those</HI> Prophets <HI>and</HI> Teachers. <HI>And they cannot be said to</HI> be∣long <HI>to that Church, because</HI> Apostles: <HI>And therefore it will follow that no more did the others.</HI></P>
<P>To which I answer,</P>
<P>THAT, since the <HI>greater Part</HI> belong'd to that Church, it makes no such Alteration, as to hurt my Ar∣gument, altho' we should allow an <HI>Exception</HI> of <HI>one</HI> or <HI>two</HI> out of the Number. <HI>Paul</HI> was an Apostle, and was so at that time, I confess. But that <HI>Barnabas</HI> was an Apostle <HI>before</HI> his going with <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> upon the Mission our Text relates to, I never yet could see any sufficient Evidence. My Animadverter's Party indeed affirm it: <HI>but has he, or they, prov'd it? No,</HI> (if I may borrow some of his own pretty Turns here) <HI>That is an
<PB N="45" REF="002636_0047_0FE5D742D3F77B10"/>
unusual method with the Writers on that Side; however, we cannot believe them, when the Assertion appears plainly false as it does in this Case.</HI> For before that Mission, we don't hear of <HI>Barnabas</HI>'s doing any thing more than the common Work of a <HI>Preacher.</HI> In the last Account we have of him, before that in our Text, we find the CHURCH <HI>at Jerusalem</HI> SENDING <HI>him forth, that he should go as fat as Antioch: who when he came there,</HI> exported <HI>them all; — for he was a good Man</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Then,</HI> after he had preached to them awhile with good Success, <HI>he departed to Tarsus for to seek</HI> Saul; <HI>and when he had found him, he brought him unto</HI> Antioch. (<HI>Acts</HI> 11.22 <HI>&amp;c.</HI>) Now for the <HI>Reason</HI> and <HI>End</HI> of this, I will refer my Animadverter to one of his own Bre∣thren (Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI>) whose Paraphrase on the place runs thus, — <Q><HI>Then departed Barnabas</HI> (from Antioch) <HI>to Tarsus, to seek</HI> Saul, (perhaps that he being an <HI>Apostle</HI> might lay his Hands on some of them, that they might receive the <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> Acts 8.17.) <HI>And when he had found him</HI> &amp;c.</Q> — Here we have this learned Prelatist hinting his Opinion, that <HI>Barnabas</HI> at that time was <HI>not</HI> an <HI>Apostle.</HI> And if so, then only <HI>Saul</HI> is left, appearing to be of that Character: and he is mention'd last. <HI>Barnabas</HI> begins the Catalogue: and <HI>Saul</HI> finishes it, who might be placed <HI>after</HI> all, because (<HI>He</HI> being an <HI>Apostle,</HI> and <HI>They</HI> only <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI>) they did more strictly and properly <HI>belong</HI> to the Church at <HI>Antioch,</HI> than He. However, I am willing for the present to humour the matter, &amp; take my Antagonist in his own way, by admitting <HI>Barnabas</HI> to be an <HI>Apostle,</HI> before the Mission our Text relates to: which will make two of the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers</HI> spoken of, <HI>Apostles.</HI> Nevertheless the <HI>greater</HI> Number still remains, who in a strict Sense belong'd to that Church, as the ordinary Teachers of it. And on <HI>that</HI> Account, <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI> might be mention'd under the Character they sus∣tain'd in <HI>common</HI> with Them: according to the known and allow'd Practice of Men, in the like Cases, who use to denominate the <HI>whole,</HI> from the <HI>Majority.</HI></P>
<P>AND then, if we reflect a little, we shall find occasion to think it no such Absurdity, tho' we reckon
<PB N="46" REF="002636_0048_0FE5D7CC8CC98B58"/>
<HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI> among the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> AS belonging then to the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Antioch.</HI> Let us hear Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI>'s Thoughts upon the Propriety of it, who thus vindicates his Reading of the Place, (which, as I told you before, is) —<HI>There were some Prophets and Teachers in Antioch, belonging to that Church.</HI> He notes, — <Q>And indeed <HI>Barnabas</HI> &amp; <HI>Paul</HI> might well be reckon'd such; <HI>Barnabas</HI> being sent thither by the Church of <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> (Chap. 11.22.) and <HI>He</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> preaching there a <HI>whole Year</HI> (ver. 26▪) and be∣ing sent by <HI>that Church</HI> to Jerusalem, with their Alms. (<HI>ver.</HI> 30.) — And it is to be observed, when they had compleated their temporary Mission to preach to the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> (that being the Work to which they were called, <HI>ver.</HI> 2.) they then return'd to <HI>Antioch,</HI> and gave an Account of it to the Church there, decla∣ring what they had done in Prosecution of it, <HI>Chap.</HI> 14.26, 27.</Q></P>
<P>THESE Considerations, the learned <HI>Doctor</HI> judg'd to be a full Vindication of <HI>his Reading;</HI> and do sufficiently show us, that it carries in it <HI>no such Impropriety</HI> of Speech (as at first view one might be apt to imagine) altho' according to it, <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> be reckon'd among the <HI>Prophets</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> said to <HI>belong</HI> to the Church of <HI>Antioch.</HI></P>
<P><HI>NOW to sum up the Evidence:</HI> since the Whole might be <HI>denominated</HI> from the <HI>Major</HI> Part, and especially since <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> might well enough be said (in a man∣ner) to belong to the Church of <HI>Antioch</HI> at that time; it follows that <HI>their</HI> being <HI>Apostles</HI> can be no forceable Plea in Bar to the <HI>Doctor</HI>'s Reading, nor to my Argument grounded upon it. And thus we see, by a little Attenti∣on to the Words of the <HI>Text,</HI> that those who separated <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> were neither <HI>Di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cesans</HI> nor <HI>Apostles.</HI> But further to strengthen the Argument,</P>
<P N="2">(2.) LET us take a View of the <HI>Context;</HI> and see if we can't trace their Original, and fix their Character, by <HI>comparing</HI> Things a little.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="002636_0049_0FE5D7CD765DEC48"/>IF we look back to <HI>Act.</HI> 8.1. we shall read of <HI>a great Persecution</HI> of the Church at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> by which They were all scattered abroad, <HI>except the Apostles.</HI> And then in <HI>Chap.</HI> 11.19. we have this account, That <HI>they which were scattered abroad, travelled as far as</HI> — Ant<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>och, <HI>preaching the Word</HI>—. Now, if we throw together a few Circumstances, it will appear highly pro∣bable, that the <HI>Ministers,</HI> who separated <HI>Paul &amp; Barna∣bas,</HI> were some of these dispersed Disciples. For we find, by <HI>Act.</HI> 11.20. That <HI>Some of them which came down to</HI> Antioch, <HI>were Men</HI> originally <HI>of Cyrene.</HI> And in our Text, <HI>Lucius</HI> (one of the Ordainers) is expresly said to be a <HI>Cyrenean.</HI> Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> therefore, by a very just &amp; easy Consequence, positively concludes <HI>him</HI> to be one of those <HI>that then came down to Antioch.</HI> And as to <HI>Ni∣ger,</HI> he vouches <HI>Epiphanius</HI> for <HI>his</HI> being one of the <HI>Seven∣ty;</HI> and so probably one of the <HI>Dispersed</HI> from <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> who are said to travel as far as <HI>Antioch,</HI> preaching the Word; some of whom were Men of <HI>Cyprus:</HI> and accordingly Dr. <HI>Lightfoot</HI> conceives this <HI>Niger</HI> to be a <HI>Cypriot.</HI> Finally, as to <HI>Manaen,</HI> our Text tells us, <HI>he was brought up with</HI> Herod <HI>the Tetrarch,</HI> bred at Court: but turning Christian, he was persecuted with the Rest; and it's likely was one of those that were <HI>scatter'd abroad</HI> by the Persecution.— Thus I have reduced it to a mo∣ral Certainty, or rational Probability, that the <HI>three Or∣dainers</HI> were some of the <HI>Dispersion:</HI> and I think it needs no further Scrutiny, to discover, that they were neither <HI>Prelates</HI> nor <HI>Apostles,</HI> but Pastors &amp; Ministers of the Word. — This may suffice for the Confirmation of my Point: and let not my <HI>Animadverter</HI> complain again, for want of <HI>Proof</HI> on our side; until he is able to produce as probable Evidence in favour of his <HI>own</HI> Assertion.</P>
<P>BUT perhaps he may start an Objection here &amp; say,</P>
<P><HI>WHAT tho' it be granted they were of those that were dispersed, and at that time were but Presbyters! Yet this argues nothing; because they might afterwards be advanced to the Episcopate.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="002636_0050_0FE59B486BD40438"/>TO which I reply; —</P>
<P>THAT they could not <HI>all</HI> be Diocesan Bishops, I have prov'd before, when I observ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, that They all <HI>belong'd</HI> to the Church of <HI>Antioch,</HI> and that our Opponents Scheme allows of but <HI>one Bishop in a Church</HI> at the same time, And now,—</P>
<P>THAT <HI>not so much as one</HI> of them was a Bishop (of such a Stamp) I hope will appear to every one's Satis∣faction, upon a considerate View of two things. Let us,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Reflect on the forecited Story <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Acts</HI> 11.22 &amp;c.</NOTE> of <HI>Barna∣bas.</HI> We are told, <HI>the Church which was in</HI> Jerusalem <HI>sent forth</HI> Barnabas, <HI>that he should go as far as</HI> Antioch: <HI>who when he came,— exhorted them all</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Then departed</HI> Barnabas <HI>to</HI> Tarsus <HI>for to seek</HI> Saul: <HI>and when he had found him, he brought him unto</HI> An∣tioch.—But now what <HI>Need</HI> of this, if there were al∣ready at <HI>Antioch,</HI> either Apostles, or a Prelate? Observe it, I have before produced such Considerations, as carry in them a good force of Argument, that <HI>They</HI> who sepa∣rated <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> were of the Number of those who were scattered abroad by the Persection at <HI>Jerusa∣lem,</HI> and who then went down to <HI>Antioch;</HI> preaching the Word there: and that therefore at that time they were but <HI>Presbyters.</HI> And now that they were not any of them advanced to the <HI>Apostolate</HI> or the <HI>Episcopate,</HI> when <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> went to <HI>Antioch,</HI> seems a rational Conclusion; for that otherwise <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI>'s going thither must have been needless, as to any thing that peculiarly concern'd the Work of an <HI>Apostle,</HI> or the Office of a <HI>Bishop.</HI> But whatever may be the Strength of this Plea, in Objection to my <HI>Animadverter</HI>'s precari∣ous Hypothesis: let me add,</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> I am sure, In the whole Affair of <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI>'s Mission, there is not the least Intimation of any thing that carrys even the Shadow of <HI>Prelacy;</HI> no Hint of any one that had the Supremacy over the Rest. The Direction runs in the <HI>Plural</HI> Num∣ber:
<PB N="49" REF="002636_0051_0FE59B5B7636C4D8"/>
<HI>The Holy Ghost said, Separate</HI> YE [<GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>] The Address is to a collective Body of Presbyters, and not to a single Prelate, — And the Transaction was manag'd by a <HI>Plurality,</HI> a Triumvirate. THEY <HI>fasted and prayed and laid on Hands:</HI> And THEY <HI>sent them away.</HI> And it is observable, when <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> returned to <HI>Antioch</HI> (from whence they had been recommended to the Grace of God, for the Work which they had fulfilled; as we have the Report, <HI>Acts.</HI> 14.26, 27.) <HI>They gather∣ed the Church together,</HI> and <HI>rehearsed all that God had done with them</HI> — They gave this Account, not to the <HI>Bishop,</HI> (as it might have been expected, had there been one there) nor to the <HI>Apostles,</HI> (as <HI>Barnabas</HI> had done at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> in another Case before. <HI>Acts</HI> 9.27.) but to the <HI>Church,</HI> comprehending both Officers, and Members. — So that there is not the least Ink∣ling of a <HI>Prelatical</HI> or <HI>Apostolical</HI> Character upon any of those that separated <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the whole then it may very rationally be infer'd, <HI>We have here an Instance of</HI> Presbyters <HI>ordain∣ing; and that without the Presidency of any</HI> Superiour, <HI>whether Apostle, or Diocesan Bishop:</HI> which was the Proposition my Animadverter charg'd with want of Proof. But I believe he'l find no Grounds to complain again on this head. For I suppose my point now pretty well prov'd. And if so, then of Consequence, that <HI>great Question</HI> is decided, in favour of <HI>my</HI> Cause, <HI>viz.</HI> Whether the Power of Ordination was originally annexed to the Government of <HI>Prelates,</HI> in opposition to that of <HI>Pres∣byters?</HI> The <HI>Discussion whereof</HI> (our Answerer ob∣serves <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Def.</HI> 21—.</NOTE>) <HI>determines the Controversy.</HI> I can't see then but that the Controversy must now be finally shut up. For I dare appeal to any one, who is not bias'd by a de∣sign to serve an <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> whether I have not sufficient∣ly prov'd my Point, and set it in a very unexceptionable Light. My Antagonist himself, I think, must needs own he was under a mistake, at least, in saying, That if Paul <HI>and</HI> Barnabas <HI>were (notwithstanding their being called
<PB N="50" REF="002636_0052_0FE5D7CFA071DCC8"/>
there</HI> Prophets <HI>and</HI> Teachers) <HI>really</HI> Apostles <HI>or</HI> Bishops, NO <HI>Reason can be given to question it, that the</HI> others <HI>were also really such.</HI> — You see I've brought to view some very strong Reasons for <HI>Suspicion</HI> (at least) that they were neither <HI>Apostles</HI> nor <HI>Diocesans.</HI> — But now if he shall turn me off (as in another Case, he has done the <HI>Remarker</HI>) with bluntly saying, <HI>We deny all these groundless Surmises;</HI> I may then presume to tell him (in his own Words <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Def. of Mod. Pr. pag. 25, 27.</NOTE> which perhaps will found as well in my Mouth as his) That it was <HI>most unjust &amp; against all the Laws of Reasoning, to put</HI> me <HI>upon the proof of a</HI> Negative; <HI>The</HI> (bringing of) <HI>Proof belongs to himself, the positive Affirmer; which, because there is no ground to go upon, we are assured can never be done. In Points of so great Consequence, we must go upon certain Facts, and not upon mere Conjecture, supported by no Reason</HI> or Evidence. <HI>And when nothing of this Nature appears, it is intolerable Boldness to conclude confidently.</HI> — Very just Observations! Wou'd he had acted always up∣on his own Rules! But happy and rare is the Man that condemneth not himself, one way or other, in that thing which he alloweth. I hope he will take Care, the next time he writes, to bring some positive Proofs of his As∣sertion; or else my negative Arguments (at least without a solid Refutation) must needs, in the Judgment of the impartial World, remain of Force against him: and so he will lie open to a too just Imputation of what he calls the <HI>Remarker's</HI> Iniquity, <HI>Adding to the Scripture, and creating Apostles at his pleasure.</HI> I shall securely wait his Answer: and hasten now in the last place to consider —</P>
<P>§. 3. THE <HI>other Text</HI> he has attempted to set in a <HI>true Light,</HI> viz. 1 Tim. 5.17. <HI>Let the Elders that rule well, be counted worthy of double Honour;</HI> Especially <HI>they who labour in the Word and Doctrine.</HI></P>
<P>A large Stride, you may observe it is, my Animadver∣ter here takes; there being above a <HI>dozen</HI> pages, between the other Text and this, which have entirely escap'd his

Remarks: altho' some things are there said, which bear pretty hard upon the Author, and the Cause, he has un∣dertaken to defend, and nothing he has offer'd any where (either in his <HI>Defence,</HI> or in his <HI>Animadversions</HI>) that I can discern, will possibly serve for a Reply. However the Gentleman skips over all (for what Reason, I can't tell; unless it were, because he saw such Difficulties thrown in his way, as he despair'd of ever being able to grapple with) and by one great and sudden Leap, comes to a <HI>Text,</HI> which, though I laid some Stress upon it, yet belong'd not to the main Argument, but was brought in only <HI>occasionally,</HI> in arguing upon an <HI>Hypothesis,</HI> that I did not actually <HI>grant</HI> my Author, though I was willing for once to take him in his own way.</P>
<P>THE Design, upon which I used this Text, was to prove, that <HI>Teaching</HI> is a more honorable Office than <HI>Ruling:</HI> and that therefore, admitting <HI>Bishops</HI> and <HI>Pres∣byters</HI> to be two distinct Orders, yet <HI>Bishops</HI> are not <HI>Su∣perior</HI> to them. And here after several Hints pre∣mised, I came to argue from the <HI>Distinction</HI> which the Apostle (in 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17.) puts upon the <HI>Elders</HI> that <HI>labour in the Word;</HI> requiring pecu∣liar <HI>Honours</HI> to be paid <HI>Them,</HI> above the Elders that la∣bour in <HI>Rule:</HI> which I presum'd, He would not have done, if the Elders that <HI>rule</HI> (yea and rule <HI>well</HI>) had been more honourable than their Brethren.— Now the <HI>Animadverter</HI> singles out <HI>this Text,</HI> and makes his Exceptions against my Remarks upon it. I had observ'd, Either there must be but <HI>one</HI> Sort of Elder here spoken of; or there are <HI>two</HI> Kinds intended, one <HI>ruling,</HI> and the other <HI>teaching:</HI> (Which is but agreeable to Bishop <HI>Burnet's</HI> <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pastoral Care.</HI> Pag. 6.</NOTE> Remark on the Place, who seems to speak with the like Uncertainty as I did, saying, <HI>St.</HI> Paul <HI>divides this Title of</HI> Elder, <HI>either into two different Performan∣ces of the Duties of the same Rank, or into two diffe∣rent Ranks; those that rule well, and those that labour in word:</HI>) and taken either way, it makes against the pre∣tended Superiority of Bishops unto Presbyters. — Now the Animadverter tells us, <HI>He is ready to think I am so
<PB N="52" REF="002636_0054_0FE5D74996F8F758"/>
far in the Right as to be for the former Exposition, &amp; that I allow,</HI> 1 Thes. 5.12. <HI>to be a good Comment on that Text.</HI> Indeed I did not declare positively which of the Exposi∣tions I was for; and on that Account he is pleas'd to tax me with <HI>acting the disingenuous Part here.</HI> (By the way, suppose I have; yet it's no worse than <HI>he himself</HI> has done (upon <HI>Act.</HI> 13.1.) <HI>in not saying positive∣ly whether he took</HI> the Antiochian <HI>Teachers</HI> for <HI>Apostles,</HI> or for <HI>Bishops.</HI>) But I can't see the Justice of this Accu∣sation; for it was sufficient to my purpose, if the Text cou'd <HI>neither way</HI> be reconciled to the Prelatical Scheme, particularly as exhibited in the <HI>Modest Proof,</HI> &amp; M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Barclay's <HI>Short Proof.</HI> However, since he has suppos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me to be for the <HI>former</HI> Construction, and to be <HI>so far in the Right,</HI> I am willing to take him in his own way (without disputing whether that be right, or wrong) and hope to make good my <HI>Argument</HI> from it against <HI>Pre∣lacy:</HI> which runs after this manner,—<HI>If these Elders are one and the same, then here's a Comparison be∣tween the several Parts of their Office,</HI> Ruling <HI>and</HI> Teaching; <HI>and the Preference is given to the Latter:</HI> or to allude to my Animadverter's Construction of this Passage, <HI>That Part of their Office which is Doctrinal, is more honourable than that which is Ruling;</HI> &amp; tho' <HI>as Ru∣lers,</HI> They are to be accounted worthy of double Honour, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is an egregious Blunder in my <HI>Antagonist,</HI> to make the Sense of the Text according to me, to be, That <HI>You are</HI> [He meant, <HI>He is,</HI> i. e. an Elder is) <HI>to be honoured as a Ruler, but with half the Honour of a Teacher.</HI></NOTE> yet more especially <HI>as Teachers. Now this Exposition</HI> (however <HI>silly</HI> my Animadverter may imagine it) is capa∣ble of <HI>one</HI> very good <HI>Consequence</HI> at least, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>they who are vested with the Powers of Preaching,</HI> [suppo∣sing there to be a distinct Order of mere preaching Pres∣byters] are instated in that Office which is of the greatest Dignity, and hence by good Rights ought to go shares with others of the Clergy (<HI>vested with the Powers of Ruling</HI> too) in the highest Honours due unto them. So that, altho' I shou'd not be able to <HI>prove our Bishops to have renounced the Powers of Preaching, when They were
<PB N="53" REF="002636_0055_0FE5D7D9E7C15670"/>
vested with the Powers of Ruling,</HI> (but should allow it to be <HI>false in Fact</HI>) Yet, since <HI>They</HI> are CHIEFLY to be honor'd for <HI>that</HI> Office, which they sustain in <HI>com∣mon</HI> with other Clergymen, <HI>it will follow that they are to be honor'd with</HI> no greater <HI>Honors</HI> than what <HI>are due</HI> to mere Presbyters, vested only with that single Office. For the additional <HI>Powers of Ruling</HI> cause no new Ac∣cession of <HI>Dignity</HI> to the Bishop; and so can challenge no higher measures of Respect to him, than are owing to his Fellow-Presbyters. <HI>The Complication of the Offices</HI> (whatever my Animadverter may pretend) <HI>can have no Consequence,</HI> to his Purpose, <HI>unless he can prove our Bishops to have</HI> receiv'd some superior Office (<HI>when they were vested with the Powers of Ruling</HI>) to which <HI>are annexed Honours</HI> superior to Those, decreed by the Apostle, unto the Office of <HI>Labouring in the Word.</HI> And here I may illustrate this by a familiar Comparison: We'l suppose (what is known Fact among us) that there are two Gentlemen of the <HI>Civil Order;</HI> agreeing in this, that both of them belong to his <HI>Majesty's Council,</HI> but differ∣ing in another Circumstance, <HI>viz.</HI> That one of them is also in the <HI>Commission of the Peace,</HI> and the other not. Now, I pray, Is this Complication of Offices in the <HI>Justice</HI> cumulative to his Dignity? Does it intitule him to greater Honors than are due to his <HI>Brother-Counsillour?</HI> I trow not. But why not? The Reason is obvious,— Because the <HI>super added</HI> Office, which he holds, is <HI>inferior</HI> to that which is <HI>common</HI> to them both. Now, if it be∣speaks no Accretion of Dignity, how can it give him a just Pretence to any superior Respects! — 'Tis easy to apply this to the Case in Hand.</P>
<P>I have now said enough, I suppose, to satisfy every unbias'd Person of the Weakness of my <HI>Animadverter</HI>'s Reasonings upon 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5.17. and that he has by no means been able to reconcile the Apostolical Canon here, with the Prelatical Scheme of Things. So that I find as much ground still to say it, as before. That <HI>if any Man will do this, and make Sense of the Text, He must have a better Knack at solving Paradoxes than I can pretend to.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="002636_0056_0FE5D7DAAA5EDCE0"/>I fear I have by this time tired you, as well as myself. Nevertheless, I must beg your Patience, while I add a few auxiliary Hints upon the Argument: which will leave my Antagonist without any Reserves of Object<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on; and I think, effectually preclude all ways of Escape: and then I'll draw to a C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ose.</P>
<P>IT may be observ'd that when the <HI>Elders</HI> spoken of in our Text are call'd <HI>the same,</HI> this admits of a double Mean∣ing, and may be understood as referring either to the <HI>Spe∣cies</HI> or to <HI>Individuals.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First</HI> IF it refers to <HI>Individuals</HI> or Singulars, and the Elders in both parts of the Text are understood to be <HI>numerically</HI> the same; Then we may suppose the Sense to run thus (as I am ready to think my Animadverter wou'd have it carry'd) <HI>Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double Honour; especially They labouring in the Word and Doctrine.</HI> And so we may understand the Apostle here to <HI>state the Dignity of the Clergy in this</HI> (as Bp <HI>Burnet</HI> observes <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pastoral Care.</HI> Pag. 72.</NOTE> on another Text) <HI>That they ought to be accounted of as the Ministers of Christ, and Stew∣ards of the Mysteries of God:</HI> and he sets down <HI>this part</HI> of their Character, as the more special <HI>Foundation</HI> of that Law, which provides for the Maintenance of the Cler∣gy, <HI>That the Lord hath ordain'd that They which</HI> preach <HI>the Gospel, shou'd live of the Gospel.</HI> The two compre∣hensive Branches of the Episcopal Function are <HI>Preaching</HI> and <HI>Governing:</HI> and as that excellent <HI>Prelate</HI> elsewhere <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">112.</NOTE> observes, The constant Sense of all Churches, in all Ages, has been, that <HI>Preaching is the Bishops</HI> GREAT <HI>Duty.</HI> This is truly the <HI>primary</HI> Business of their Calling, and the most shining part of their Character. They shou'd <HI>give themselves continually to the Ministry of the Word and Prayer,</HI> as the more special Design of their Order. The <HI>Apostles</HI> thought this to be Their grand Duty, and made it their chief Employment. (<HI>Act.</HI> 6.4.) <HI>Government,</HI> and <HI>Discipline,</HI> and <HI>Ordination,</HI> are but <HI>subordinate</HI> and more <HI>occasional</HI> or incidental Businesses, and design'd to be <HI>sub∣servient</HI> to the <HI>great</HI> and <HI>more stated</HI> Work, the Ministra∣tion
<PB N="55" REF="002636_0057_0FE5D7DC0D1B4920"/>
of the <HI>Word.</HI> Here therefore our Text places the <HI>Accent,</HI> and states the <HI>Dignity</HI> of the Clergy in this; de∣manding a double Honour for them <HI>especially</HI> as conside∣red under the Not on of <HI>Teachers of the Word. Bishop</HI> B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> son [<HI>Perpet. Gov</HI> &amp;c. p. 132.] tells us, This is the Inte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pretation, that <HI>Chrysostom</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Greek Writers embr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce. Now, if this be the Scope of the Apostle in the Words under Consideration, it then very strongly infers several important Consequences; <HI>viz</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THAT, by <HI>the Elders</HI> spoken of, we are not to understand any Office<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s <HI>superior</HI> to the (supposed mere) <HI>Teachers of the Word:</HI> because this is the <HI>highest</HI> and <HI>most worthy</HI> Character, that any can sustain. And then,</P>
<P N="2">2. THAT there are no s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd Grounds so the <HI>Hypo∣thesis</HI> (we are arguing upon) of <HI>stated mere teaching Presbyters,</HI> distinct from <HI>Bishops</HI> voited with the Powers both of Preaching &amp; Ruling. For, it the Office of <HI>Teach∣ing</HI> be the principal and <HI>most noble</HI> Part of the Ministry, it affords us a strong presumptive Argument, That all who are invested with <HI>this,</HI> have also the Powers of <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> and <HI>Ordination</HI> belonging to them; because no sub∣stancial Reason can be assigned (in this Case) <HI>Why</HI> they who have the <HI>Greater,</HI> should be deny'd the <HI>Lesser.</HI></P>
<P>But thus much for the first Thing.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> WHEN the <HI>Elders</HI> in our Text are said to be the <HI>same,</HI> it may only mean They are <HI>specifically</HI> the same, and belong to one and the same Order.</P>
<P>NOW these Elders, tho' in this general-View the same, yet may in regard of some particular Circumstances differ.</P>
<P>And accordingly, — Either,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE may understand by <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. or <HI>Elders that rule,</HI> Fixed Pastors, or Prefects of Churches already con∣stituted, (such as we suppose the Elders of <HI>Ephesus</HI> to be) having the oversight of the Flock: and by <HI>Elders that labour in Word and Doctrine,</HI> Itinerant Preach∣ers, or <HI>Evang<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lists,</HI> (which according to the Author of <HI>Mod. Proof</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Pag. 14.</NOTE> are at the most but <HI>Presbyters</HI>) such as <HI>Apollos, Judas, Silas, Mark</HI> and others; and thus some learned Men (Dr. <HI>Hammond</HI> <NOTE N="{inverted †}" PLACE="foot"><HI>Annot.</HI> on <HI>Act.</HI> 11. <HI>Lett.</HI> b.</NOTE>, Bp. <HI>Bilson,</HI> &amp;c.) do in∣terpret
<PB N="56" REF="002636_0058_0FE5D7E6F8B8A140"/>
the Phrase, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> — i. e. <HI>Travel∣ling</HI> in preaching the Gospel to such a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not heard it before. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Or,</P>
<P N="2">2. WE may understand by Elders, in <HI>both</HI> parts of the Text, the <HI>settled Pastors</HI> of particular Churches; tho' spoken of as distinguishable from one another, and to be estimated, by their <HI>Gifts and Labours in Preaching.</HI> So Bp. <HI>Stillingfleet</HI> in his Ordination-Sermon, carries it.</P>
<P>AND take the Text in either Sense, I can't see how it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ally be apply'd to serve the Cause of Prelacy.</P>
<P>FOR, if the <HI>first</HI> Sense be admitted, then it follows there have been <HI>Presbyters</HI> (not <HI>taking the Oversight</HI> of any particular Charges, but chiefly employed in preach∣ing the Gospel in one place and another, who yet were accounted by the Apostle) worthy of Honours <HI>superior</HI> to those due to the <HI>Bishops</HI> of the Flock. From whence we may fairly argue that such as are vested with the Pow∣ers of <HI>Preaching,</HI> have a just Title to Honours, equal to what are owing to <HI>Bishops,</HI> whose governing Powers can give them no Claim to any peculiar Respects.</P>
<P>OR, if the <HI>second,</HI> then by the Apostle's Rule here, a special Regard is to be paid unto <HI>those Pastors,</HI> that ex∣cel in the <HI>best Gifts,</HI> and most <HI>useful Labours;</HI> which be determines to be those of <HI>Preaching.</HI> Ministers are to be honour'd <HI>for their Work sake;</HI> which comprehends those two great Lines of Duty, <HI>Governing</HI> and <HI>Preach∣ing.</HI> But <HI>Preaching</HI> is the <HI>main</HI> and <HI>more eminent</HI> part of their Work. — Now some excel in one of those, and others in t'other. And <HI>All</HI> are to be accounted worthy of double Honour; but <HI>especially</HI> they who excel (as to Skill, Fidelity, and Application) in <HI>Preaching,</HI> which is the Work that carries in its Nature, the greatest <HI>Dignity,</HI> and gives any the <HI>more exalted Character.</HI> And accord∣ingly our <HI>Animadverter</HI> does elsewhere (<HI>Def. of Mod. Proof,</HI> p. 24.) interpret the Text, as a <HI>Rule</HI> not only to the <HI>People,</HI> for the Direction of <HI>their</HI> Conduct towards their <HI>Ministers,</HI> but also as a Rule to <HI>Timothy,</HI> for the Direction of <HI>his</HI> Conduct towards Them, <HI>To prefer the deseruing.</HI> And at the same time, it is observable, the <HI>Apostle</HI> declares those to be the <HI>most deserving,</HI> who ap∣prove themselves the most skilful, faithful, and laborious
<PB N="57" REF="002636_0059_0FE5D74D7981D8F8"/>
<HI>Preachers.</HI> He singles out These for the first <HI>Prefer∣ments,</HI> and recommends them to <HI>Timothy,</HI> to receive the special Marks of his Favour.</P>
<P>IT remains now only to shew (if the <HI>Elders</HI> spoken of, be of the same Order) that one or t'other of those <HI>Senses</HI> must be admitted; by proving that the Sense my <HI>Animadverter</HI> is for, who (by a strong Effort of Imagination) supposes them to be <HI>Diocesan Bishops,</HI> is intirely wrong, and must be rejected. And to prove they were not <HI>Diocesan Bishops,</HI> I will chuse out three Argu∣ments, which the Gentleman himself has furnished me withal; enough to plunge him into inextricable La∣byrinths.</P>
<P N="1">1. THIS Notion is superseded by his own <HI>Gloss</HI> upon our Text, but now mention'd, making it a <HI>Rule to Bishop Timothy,</HI> for his Direction in the <HI>Government</HI> of his Presbyters, <HI>To prefer the Deseruing.</HI> — Which may at least have the Force of an <HI>Argumentum ad Hominem.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE Gentleman has effectually dismounted that Hy∣pothesis, by a <HI>Concession</HI> He hath made elsewhere <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Def.</HI> p. 21. <HI>Append.</HI> p. 10.</NOTE>, viz. That Presbyters <HI>have a Government over their single Congregations,</HI> and are vested with <HI>the Powers both of Sacraments and Censures.</HI> By allowing of which, he has thrown a fatal Block in his own way, and put it out of his Power to prove, That by the <HI>Elders that rule well,</HI> are necessarily to be understood <HI>Diocesan Bishops,</HI> and not Con∣gregational Pastors.</P>
<P N="3">3. IT must be conclusive in this Dispute, to observe, He himself tells us here, That <HI>he thinks I am so far in the</HI> RIGHT, <HI>as to</HI> grant that the Elders in both parts of our Text, <HI>are the same, and that I allow</HI> 1 Thes. 5.12. <HI>to be a good Comment on the Text.</HI> — For, if I am so far in the Right, then I'm sure I shall be in the Right also, if I af∣firm the Elders in 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 5. are of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me Species with those i 4 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5. — And I am equally sure then they could not be <HI>Diocesan</HI> Prelates: Because the <HI>Thessaloni∣an</HI> Elders were but <HI>Parishional</HI> or <HI>Congregational</HI> Bishops; as will plainly appear to every one, upon the sedate Con∣sideration of a few Things. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> As,</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="58" REF="002636_0060_0FE5D76934236980"/>(1.) THERE was a <HI>Plurality</HI> of these Presidents or Overseers in that one Church. Therefore they could not be <HI>Diocesan</HI> Bishops.</P>
<P N="2">(2.) THERE is no special Mark put upon any <HI>single Person</HI> among them, as having a Prerogative above the Rest: but they are all spoken of under one common De∣nomination of <HI>Presidents.</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> It de∣notes Superintendency, or Episcopacy. Which being at∣tributed to them all, without distinction, it argues they were a Company of <HI>Congregational Bishops,</HI> acting in an Equality: no one Man being <HI>Head</HI> of the Presbytery; unless it were under the notion of a <HI>Moderator,</HI> for Or∣der's sake. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> And then,</P>
<P N="3">(3.) THEY are described, not only as being over the Flock, but as <HI>labouring</HI> AMONG <HI>them, and admonish∣ing them:</HI> which imports a Personal Communica, and immediate Watch, in execution of the <HI>Pastoral</HI> Charge.</P>
<P N="4">(4) THE <HI>Church</HI> is requir'd to <HI>know Them,</HI> and to esteem, and love Them, for their <HI>Work's sake:</HI> which ne∣cessarily presupposes their <HI>Residence</HI> in the City, and ar∣gues them to be Parochial Bishops. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Add to this,</P>
<P N="5">(5.) THE Church is requir'd to love them <HI>in the high∣est Degree,</HI> <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/>. The Word carries an Emphasis, that can't well be express'd in English. The same Phrase is us'd in <HI>Eph.</HI> 3.20. and translated <HI>Exceeding abundant∣ly.</HI> So then They are required to <HI>abound,</HI> yea to <HI>super∣abound,</HI> in the Expressions of their Esteem &amp; Love to their Teachers; Which surely cannot imply any thing less than the <HI>Double Honour,</HI> demanded in our Text. As then it must needs result, that the Elders in <HI>both</HI> Texts are of the <HI>same</HI> Species, and mean <HI>Congregational</HI> Bishops: So like∣wise the Consequence is clear to a Demonstration, that there are <HI>no other</HI> Bishops of a <HI>superior</HI> Rank; inasmuch as the <HI>highest</HI> Honours and Respects of the Church are by an express Apostolic Decree (and by my Animad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erter's own implicit Concession) due unto <HI>that</HI> sort of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>shops.</P>
<P>THUS, I have rescu'd my last Text out of our Oppo∣nent's hands; and made it appear, that by allowing 1 <HI>Thes.</HI> 5.12. to be a <HI>good Comment</HI> upon it, he has push'd hard at his own Breast, and given himself a mortal Wound,
<PB N="59" REF="002636_0061_0FE5D7E9007445A0"/>
while he thought of nothing but a fatal Thrust at <HI>me.</HI> O amazing, dreadful Mistake! While he dreamt of cast∣ing up a mighty <HI>Trench</HI> for his Security, in the Defense of an expiring Cause, he was really digging a profound <HI>Grave,</HI> to bury it in. And now he will surely pardon me, if I have been, doing a faithful Part, to ease his Task, and facilitate the Funeral. — However, I know (my Friend) that <HI>you</HI> will put the kindest Meaning upon any good Offices I may have done to that End. <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> To conclude,</P>
<P>I think I have now dissipated all the Exceptions, that our Answerer has brought against my <HI>Appendix;</HI> and ful∣ly vindicated as many of my Arguments, as he was pleas'd to attack. I'm sensible I have been too diffusive on seve∣ral heads, and in general transgress'd the Rules of Propor∣tion; but hope I've every where kept within the Bounds of <HI>Truth</HI> &amp; <HI>Soberness.</HI> I trust I have not broken over the Laws of fair Disputation, nor made a forfeiture of the <HI>Gentle∣manly</HI> Treatment, with which my Animadverter has be∣gun to distinguish me. I may justly therefore expect, if he sees fit to reply, that he will return me the <HI>same Measure:</HI> And if he advances any thing <HI>new,</HI> I shall (if I have Op∣portunity) give him my Thoughts upon it. But if he on∣ly repeats the old Story, or <HI>falls from solid Reasoning</HI> (to use an Expression of his own) I shall suppose <HI>Enough</HI> is already said on both sides, and shall hardly think it worth while to write a third time. For I am not at all fond of giving the <HI>last Word.</HI></P>
<P>PARDON me now (my Friend) this long Interruption, and let me once more feel the Influences of that Goodness and Candour, which endears you to all your Acquaintants, tho' to none more than</P>
