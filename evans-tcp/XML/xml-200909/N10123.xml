<HEAD>To the GENTLEMAN, who expressed his desire, that some Account might be given of the know∣ledge, which <HI>the Ancients</HI> had, concerning <HI>America.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE last Time You favoured me with a Vi∣sit at my House, You modestly discovered an Inclination and expressed a Desire; I suppose from some Specimens, which I might give of some small Acquaintance with Antiquity; that I would shew, <HI>whether the</HI> Ancients <HI>had any know∣ledge of</HI> America, and <HI>how they might come to an Acquaintance with it.</HI></P>
<P>Now, in Compliance with your Desire, and to gratify your Curiosity; I have employed myself for a few Hours in collecting, and putting toge∣ther, such Testimonies, both sacred and profane, as will render it most highly probable, if not cer∣tain, that <HI>America</HI> must be known before the mo∣dern Discoveries of it, and even in very ancient times.</P>
<P>If this Essay should prove grateful and satisfac∣tory to You, and afford Improvement and Plea∣sure to any of Your more knowing and learned, and hence more candid, Friends and Acquaint∣ance; I shall not be sorry for my Care and La∣bour in compiling it.</P>
<P>I wish You, Sir, continual Advances in Know∣ledge, Virtue, Piety and Usefulness; and am,</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Your respectful Friend, and most obedient, humble Servant. <HI>S. MATHER.</HI></SIGNED>

<HEAD>An Attempt to shew, That <HI>the Ancients</HI> must have the Know∣ledge of <HI>the Western World,</HI> or <HI>America.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is well known, that, in the Year of our Lord 1492, <HI>Christopher Columbus,</HI> of <HI>Genoa,</HI> discovered the Islands of <HI>Hispaniola, Cuba</HI> and <HI>Jamaica;</HI> and that <HI>Americus Vesputius</HI> of <HI>Florence,</HI> under the Direction and Encouragement of <HI>Emanuel,</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> in the Year 1497, discovered the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> which has been so called from that Time after his Name.</P>
<P>Now many have imagined, and even some of the Learned among them, that this <HI>Western World</HI> was never known before these Discoveries of the <HI>Genoese</HI> and <HI>Florentine</HI> Commanders.—Thus the learned <HI>Pan∣ciroll</HI> in particular sees fit to reckon the <HI>New World,</HI> or <HI>America,</HI> among the Things, which were <HI>unknown to</HI> the Ancients. <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">Parcirollus, De Novo Orbe. Lib. 2. Tit. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Americus Vesputius</HI> too, in his Epistle to <HI>Renatus,</HI> King of <HI>Jerusalem</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> and Duke of <HI>Lorrain</HI> and <HI>Barre,</HI> writes, as follows, <HI>We believe, that, as our Ancestors make no mention of the Islands and firm Lands of</HI> America; <HI>so the</HI> Ancients themselves <HI>had no know∣ledge of them.</HI>—And the Publisher of this Epistle, to∣gether with a Number of Tracts wrote by ancient
<PB N="6" REF="012861_0005_0F8B94423AC618C8"/>
Voyagers, <HI>Sebastian Munster,</HI> observes, that <HI>Christopher Columbus</HI> and <HI>Albericus</HI> [for so he writes it] <HI>Vesputius</HI> were the first of Mortals, who found out <HI>America,</HI> and other unknown Lands.</P>
<P>However, the learned <HI>Keckerman,</HI> having well con∣sidered, whether <HI>America</HI> was known to the Ancients or no, and weighed the most probable Arguments on both Sides of this Question, has plainly given his Judg∣ment in Favour of <HI>it's being known to</HI> them.</P>
<P>But, if this Matter be examined with Judgment, and with proper Care and Accuracy, we shall find Reason to believe, that this <HI>large Part of the World was really known to</HI> the Ancients; and perhaps we shall see much more Reason to believe it, than most Men imagine, and even many of the Learned themselves can pro∣duce in opposition to it.</P>
<P>We shall take Leave to relate here; though we shall not lay any great Stress on the Relation, as it may be called a too modern one; That, in the Reign of <HI>Henry the Second,</HI> and in the Year 1170, which was 300 Years before <HI>Columbus,</HI> One <HI>Madoc ap Owen Gwineth,</HI> not only discovered <HI>South America,</HI> but set∣tled in some Part of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and left Monuments <HI>there</HI> both of <HI>the British Language and British Usages:</HI> Of which <HI>the Spaniards</HI> have taken Notice; and several <HI>Welsh</HI> Writers, and other <HI>British</HI> Authors besides, have credited and confirmed the Relation.—How this honest <HI>Madoc</HI> came to take it into his Head to visit <HI>South America,</HI> we know not. However we think it not ir∣rational to suppose, that, previously to his going <HI>there,</HI> he might have had some Account of the Country, and the Way of getting at it.</P>
<P>There is also another still more modern Account, than that of honest <HI>Madoc</HI>'s, concerning the Discovery of <HI>America;</HI> which, although it be a little more mo∣dern,
<PB N="7" REF="012861_0006_0F8B944360411098"/>
it may not be amiss to offer. This may be found in <HI>Ortelius</HI>'s <HI>Theatre,</HI> as follows: <HI>The Northem Part of</HI> the New World, <HI>which is especially extended towards</HI> Europe, Groenland, Iseland and Friesland; <HI>and is named</HI> Estotiland <HI>by some Fishermen of the Island of</HI> Friesland, <HI>who were driven by a Tempest to these Shores: This,</HI> being of old viewed and observed, <HI>about this Year, that is the Year of our LORD</HI> 1340, Nic∣olas and Antony Zenus, <HI>Brethren, noble</HI> Venetians, <HI>under the Auspices of</HI> Zichmi, <HI>called King of</HI> Friesland, <HI>again recognized and brought to Knowledge.</HI> And <HI>John Skoluo,</HI> a Polonian, in 1456, sailed to this Country. If any should ask, what Place this <HI>Estotiland</HI> is? I can only answer, that some Geographers take it to be <HI>New-foundland,</HI> or <HI>Cape Breton:</HI> But others think it to be <HI>New Britain,</HI> and the Land of <HI>Labrador.</HI> However it is agreed by all, that it was a Part of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>But, instead of taking up Time about these or any more modern Relations, we shall go back to <HI>more ancient Times and Things,</HI> which have Relation to <HI>this Western World.</HI></P>
<P>It is remarked by a learned Spanish Writer, <HI>Villal∣pandus,</HI> that his Fellow-Citizen of <HI>Corduba, L. Annaeus Seneca,</HI> who was Nephew to that famous <HI>Seneca,</HI> the Tutor of the Brute <HI>Nero; when the Form of the World did not yet appear to be known, yet foretold, that another World should be found out:</HI> <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Villalpand.</HI> De Magin Divinatrice, Lib. 1. cap. 4. p. 7.</NOTE> It is true this <HI>L. Annaeus Seneca,</HI> in one of his <HI>Dramatic</HI> Pieces, says, that <HI>in late Years Ages shall come, in which Ocean shall loose the Bonds of Things,</HI> and <HI>the mighty Earth shall be laid open, and</HI> Thyphis <HI>shall discover</HI> new Worlds. <NOTE N="(c)" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—Venient Annis</L>
<L>Secula seris; quibus Oceanus</L>
<L>Vincula rerum laxet, &amp; ingeus</L>
<L>Patent Tellus; <HI>Thyphisque novos</HI></L>
<L>Deteget Orbes—Senica <HI>Medes.</HI></L></Q></NOTE>
<PB N="8" REF="012861_0007_0F8B9443D8AFF240"/>
But although <HI>Seneca</HI>'s Townsman hence affirms, that he <HI>foretold another World should be found out;</HI> we need not be so unreasonably credulous as to believe, that, when he wrote in this Manner, he was <HI>inspired with the Spirit of Prophecy:</HI> No! For nothing of this Sort appears. It is much more likely, that, either from some faint Apprehension of the Structure of the <HI>Terraqueous Globe,</HI> or from some <HI>traditional Accounts of the Greatness of the Earth,</HI> and <HI>of another World</HI> besides their old one, he might write after this <HI>seem∣ingly Prophetical</HI> Manner.—But, if any think, that what he has thus written should be taken only for <HI>Poetical Fiction,</HI> or fanciful Prophecy, we shall be con∣tented: For we do not build much upon it.</P>
<P>But there is an <HI>Historical</HI> Passage handed to us by <HI>Pomponius Mela,</HI> who lived in the Emperour <HI>Clau∣dius</HI>'s Time, about the Year of our Lord 93; which, as it is remarkable, is deserving both of a particular Recital and an attentive Consideration: It is as fol∣lows;—When <HI>Metellus Celer,</HI> who by the Way was called <HI>Celer</HI> for his Quickness in preparing to celebrate the <HI>Funeral Obsequies</HI> of his Father, was <HI>Proconsul</HI> a∣mong <HI>the Gauls,</HI> he received as a Present <HI>certain In∣dians</HI> <NOTE N="(d)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pompon. Mela.</HI> Lib. 3.</NOTE> from the King of the <HI>Suevians;</HI> who, being snatched away by the Force of Storms from <HI>the Indian Shores, at length came out</HI> to the Shores of <HI>Germany.</HI>— These are the Words of the Historian: And this History, as <HI>Vadianus</HI> the Commentator on <HI>Pomponius</HI> observes, fairly <HI>indicates, that there is a Sea which may be navigated in the most distant Tracts.</HI> <NOTE N="(e)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vadian.</HI> Note in <HI>Pompon.</HI> p. 13:</NOTE></P>
<P>Now, from this Historical Account, it seems proba∣ble, that <HI>these Indians</HI> might be carried away from the Coast of <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> or <HI>Labrador,</HI> or some other Place to the Northward, by a violent Gale of Wind of long Continuance with them, until at length they
<PB N="9" REF="012861_0008_0F8B9448F1F8A9E0"/>
arrived on <HI>the German Coast,</HI> and got a Shore there.— And the coming of these Indians might very well con∣vince and satisfie both the King of <HI>the Suevians</HI> with his People; and the <HI>Roman Proconsul,</HI> and from him the <HI>whole Roman Empire,</HI> that there was <HI>another World,</HI> besides <HI>That</HI> inhabited by themselves.</P>
<P>There was also in most ancient Times repeated Mention made of two Islands called <HI>Atlantides,</HI> which were said to have been about 10,000 Stadia distant from <HI>Libya: There</HI> were <HI>the Elysian Fields and the Dwellings of the Blessed,</HI> mentioned by <HI>Homer, Horace,</HI> and other Poets. These Islands seem to be called by <HI>Pliny</HI> the <HI>Hesperides:</HI> For he reckons two in the <HI>At∣lantic</HI> Sea: and <HI>these,</HI> as he says, beyond <HI>the Gorgons</HI> in a Navigation for 40 Days beyond <HI>the Atlantis.</HI>— Now the learned Geographer <HI>Ortelius</HI> supposes it pro∣bable, that <HI>these</HI> might be the Islands of <HI>Hispaniola</HI> and <HI>Cuba.</HI>—But <HI>Diodorus Siculus</HI> tells us, that <HI>the Atlan∣tides,</HI> or the People of those Islands, <HI>as we have re∣ceived, are inhabiting Places near to the Ocean, and very happy indeed.</HI> <NOTE N="(f)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Diodor. Sicul.</HI> De fabulosis Antiquorum <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. p. 261.</NOTE> And in Truth, if we suppose, with <HI>Ortelius,</HI> these Islands to be the same with <HI>Hispa∣niola</HI> and <HI>Cuba,</HI> they must be <HI>near the Ocean</HI> indeed, as <HI>Diodorus</HI> says: For they are surrounded with it.</P>
<P>But <HI>Plato,</HI> who lived about 400 Years before our Saviour's Time, has given us the most particular and full Account of <HI>the Atlantic Island,</HI> as it is called by him, in one and another of his Compositions: And we shall endeavour, in as clear and concise a Manner as we can, to give his Account from the Edition of his Works published by <HI>Serranus.</HI>—In one of his Di∣alogues, he says, that <HI>Neptune</HI> had by Lot <HI>the At∣lantic Island,</HI> and placed the Children he had by a mortal Woman in a certain Place of that Island.—It received, he says, its Name from its first King and
<PB N="10" REF="012861_0009_0F8B944B2D1AE3E8"/>
Lord, even from <HI>Atlas;</HI> and further adds, that the extreme Part of <HI>this Island,</HI> which he had for his Lot, was at <HI>Hercules</HI>'s <HI>Pillars.</HI> <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Platonis</HI> Critias.</NOTE>—And, in another of his Writings, <NOTE N="(g)" PLACE="foot">In Timaeo.</NOTE> the following Passages may be found: In those first Times <HI>the Atlantic was a most broad Island;</HI> and there were extant most powerful Kings in it; who, with joint Forces, appointed to occupy <HI>Asia and Europe:</HI> And so a most grievous War was carried on: In which <HI>the Athenians,</HI> with the common Consent of <HI>the Greeks,</HI> opposed themselves; and they became the Conquerors.—But <HI>that Atlantic Island</HI> by a Flood and Earthquake was indeed suddenly destroy∣ed; and so that Sort of warlike Men was absorped. N. B. These Things seem to be related with Historical Truth.—And he writes further plainly and expresly, that <HI>That Atlantic Island, being in Truth overwhelmed with the Waves of the Sea, altogether disappeared:</HI> And <HI>hence that Sea is difficult to be passed; inasmuch as copious Clay yet remained from the Reliques of</HI> that Island.—Moreover, he says, that—<HI>an Island, in the Mouth of the Sea, and in the Passage to those Straits called the Pillars of</HI> Hercules, <HI>did exist; and that Island was greater and larger than</HI> Lybia and Asia; <HI>from which there was an easy Passage over to other Islands; and from those Islands also to</HI> that Continent, <HI>which is situated out of that Region,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Plato</HI> is not singular in this Narration: For both <HI>Strabo</HI> <NOTE N="(h)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabo.</HI> Lib. 2.</NOTE> and <HI>Pliny</HI> <NOTE N="(i)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Plin.</HI> Lib. 2. Cap. 32.</NOTE> have mentioned this <HI>Atlantic Island;</HI> and say, that <HI>it was of old in the</HI> Atlantic Sea.</P>
<P>But as <HI>Plato</HI> says, that this <HI>greatest Island of the Western Ocean</HI> was lost; it is probably conjectured, that it was situated between the <HI>Azores and Canaries,</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="012861_0010_0F8B944B598A77A8"/>
as they are called: And, that <HI>These</HI> were form'd, and remain, out of the Reliques of it, <HI>Becman</HI> thought; and he believed, as he says, that it might be lengthily demonstrated.<NOTE N="(k)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Becman.</HI> Hist. Insul. c. 5.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>Hoffman</HI> has truly observed, that the <HI>Atlantis</HI> of <HI>Plato</HI> is to many <HI>America:</HI> And the learned <HI>Bochart</HI><NOTE N="(l)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Bochart.</HI> Geograph. Sacr. p. 716.</NOTE>
appears to have been of the same Mind. And indeed, if this Island was larger than <HI>Libya and Asia,</HI> as <HI>Plato</HI> has acquainted us, it looks as if it were really <HI>America,</HI> or reaching so far as to be closely connected with it.</P>
<P>There seems also Reason to think, that there must have been in ancient Times some Knowlege of the <HI>American</HI> Regions: Because we have credible Accounts of the Passages of Vessels through <HI>the Atlantis Ocean</HI> both one Way and the other:—We shall not insist on <HI>Pomponius Mela</HI>'s Account of one <HI>Endoxus;</HI> who says, <HI>in the Days of our Grandfathers,</HI> [and, as we noted before, he lived in the Time of the Emperor <HI>Claudius] when he fled from the King of Alexandria, Latyrus, he went forth from the</HI> Arabic Gulph <HI>thro' this Sea,</HI> as <HI>Nepos</HI> affirms, <HI>Gades usque pervectus est,</HI> and was carried even to <HI>Cales.</HI> <NOTE N="(m)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Pempon. Mela.</HI> Lib. 3. p. 191, cum Notis <HI>Vadiani.</HI></NOTE> Nor shall we urge the Probability of it, that he might see, if not the <HI>American Continent,</HI> at least some of <HI>the Islands</HI> be∣longing to Western World.</P>
<P>But we ought to take some respectful Notice of <HI>Hanno,</HI> the famous <HI>Cathaginian,</HI> who wrote <HI>Periplum;</HI> in which we have a Relation of the Voyage prosecu∣ted by him around the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> and the Lands found by him in the <HI>Atlantic Ocean:</HI> This Relation was written by him in the <HI>Punic,</HI> or <HI>Phoenician,</HI> Tongue: But it was afterwards translated into <HI>Greek,</HI> and it is still extant, as <HI>Hoffman</HI> gives us to understand in his
<PB N="12" REF="012861_0011_0F8B944C1CA50DB8"/>
Lexicon at the Word <HI>Annon.</HI>—It has not been the Lot of the present Writer to meet with this <HI>Periplum</HI> yet; and therefore he can make none of his own Observa∣tions upon it.—But <HI>Coelius Rhodiginus</HI> has given us this more express and particular Information of the <HI>Carthaginian's</HI> Voyage; that <HI>Hanno,</HI> <NOTE N="(n)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Cael. Rhodigini</HI> Lectiones antiquae.</NOTE> departing from <HI>Hercules</HI>'s <HI>Pillars,</HI> that is, from the Streights of <HI>Gibraltar,</HI> into the Ocean, leaving <HI>Libya</HI> to the left, <HI>sailed out</HI> 30 <HI>Days, seeking the Western Parts: But afterwards, turning to the South, he met with many Impediments.</HI>—Now, if <HI>Hanno,</HI> leaving <HI>Libya,</HI> or <HI>Africa, to the left, sailed seeking for</HI> 30 <HI>Days the Western Parts;</HI> it is most probable, that he found some of the <HI>American islands,</HI> if not some Part of the <HI>Western Continent</HI> it∣self. <HI>Columbus,</HI> as appears from his own Account, sailed with his Squadron but <HI>thirty Days to the West,</HI> when he beheld <HI>certain Islands:</HI> And, coming nearer to them, he found the Number of them to be <HI>six,</HI> whereof <HI>two</HI> were larger ones: But <HI>Americus,</HI> after sarling <HI>nineteen Days</HI> from the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> Islands, found a certain new Land, which he thought to be <HI>firm:</HI> But it proved <HI>an Island.</HI> But we may add, to this Account of <HI>Hanno,</HI> the Testimony of <HI>Diodorus Siculus,</HI> who lets us know, that <HI>certain Phoenictans were cast on a most fertile Island</HI> opposite to <HI>Africa:</HI>—We may note here, that, if it was opposite to <HI>Africa,</HI> it must be <HI>an American Island.</HI>—And he further tells us, that the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> left no Stone unturned, that <HI>this Region might remain unknown to the</HI> Europeans. <NOTE N="(o)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Diodor. Sicul.</HI> Lib. 5.</NOTE>
Here therefore we see one Reason, why <HI>the Western World</HI> was kept secret from <HI>the Europeans</HI> by the <HI>Phoenicians:</HI> It was Regard to their <HI>own Commerce and Interest,</HI> that led them without Doubt to conceal the new Places, at which they traded.</P>
<P>Moreover; we may recite from <HI>Aelian,</HI> who lived and wrote after the Emperor <HI>Adrian's</HI> Time, about
<PB N="13" REF="012861_0012_0F8B944CBB9A3D60"/>
the Year of our Lord 136, the Account, which he gives of a Colloquy between <HI>Midas of Phrygia and Silenus:</HI> In which Colloquy, among other Things, <HI>Silenus</HI> gave Information to <HI>Midas,</HI> that <HI>Europe, Asia and Libya</HI> are Islands, and surrounded with the Ocean; and that <HI>one Continent exists without this World;</HI> and he affirmed, that its Magnitude was immense and in∣finite. <NOTE N="(p)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Aelian.</HI> Variar. Historiar. Lib. 3. Cap. 8.</NOTE> Now if <HI>this one Continent</HI> existing away from the old World, and of such an <HI>immense and infi∣nite Magnitude,</HI> was not intended and meant of <HI>this Western World;</HI> we should be glad, that any one would be so kind as to let us know, what Place or Country is intended and meant by it.</P>
<P>We have thus produced <HI>Authorities,</HI> and offered <HI>Reasons</HI> sufficient to render it most highly probable, that <HI>this Western World must be known to</HI> the Ancients.</P>
<P>But here it may be demanded, if this Continent was known in ancient Times, was it inhabited in those Times; and <HI>when was it first inhabited, and by whom?</HI> And we shall endeavour to give some suitable Answer to the proper Enquiries.</P>
<P>Now it ought in all Reason to be thought, that, as <HI>America,</HI> upon the more modern Discoveries of it and Acquaintance with it, was found to be well peopled, and even stocked with Inhabitants, probably as much as <HI>Asia, Africa and Europe;</HI> surely it must have been inhabited, not merely above <HI>five hundred</HI> years; but a∣bove <HI>one, two, three and even four thousand years ago:</HI> And indeed it was probably inhabited not long after <HI>the Dispersion of those numerous Families,</HI> who were se∣parated in Consequence of the unhappy Affair at Babel.</P>
<P>The learned <HI>Grotius</HI> conceived, that <HI>the Americans</HI> came out of <HI>Europe,</HI> passing from <HI>Norway</HI> into <HI>Iceland;</HI> thence by <HI>Friesland</HI> into <HI>Greenland;</HI> and so into <HI>Esto∣tiland,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="012861_0013_0F8B944DB7D7F1B8"/>
which is probably a Part of the <HI>Western Conti∣nent.</HI> <NOTE N="(q)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Grotius</HI> De Origine Gent. Americanar.</NOTE> And we most acknowlege, that the passing out of <HI>Europe</HI> into <HI>America</HI> by this Routte is possible and not unnatural: However it does not appear so likely, that <HI>America</HI> was, first of all, settled in this Manner.</P>
<P>But we are rather most inclined to think, that <HI>the primary Americans</HI> were the Descendants of <HI>Magog</HI> from <HI>Japhet.</HI> And, when we say <HI>the primary Ameri∣cans,</HI> we mean <HI>after the Flood:</HI> For there is Reason to believe, that the People, who resided in the <HI>Western World,</HI> as well as the other Continent, were swept a∣way from the Face of the Earth; because <HI>all Flesh had corrupted their Way.</HI> Both <HI>Joseph Acosta</HI> and <HI>Antony Herrera</HI> acquaint us, that they found <HI>the Me∣mory of the Flood</HI> preserved among the Indians of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Mechoachan</HI> and <HI>Nicaragua:</HI> And <HI>Coraca</HI> tells us, that, among <HI>the Peruvians,</HI> there was a Tra∣dition, that <HI>all their Lands were plunged and laid hid in the Waters.</HI>—And if we mistake not, all the Evi∣dences <HI>in the natural World,</HI> which are commonly brought on the other Side of the Water to prove the <HI>general Inundation</HI> over that Continent, may be fairly produced to prove the general Prevalence of it over this Continent.</P>
<P>But, as we are now treating of the <HI>primary Inhabi∣tants of America</HI> after the Flood; so we say, that <HI>These</HI> appear to have descended from <HI>Japhet.</HI> As GOD, or ELONIM, as it is in the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Text, i. e. the <HI>Covenanting Ones,</HI> or <HI>the Interposers by Oath,</HI> had pro∣mised <HI>to enlarge Japhet;</HI> in which Promise there is a plain Allusion to his Name, as indeed there is a like Allusion to <HI>Names</HI> very frequently to be found in the Holy Scriptures; so this Promise was most remarkably fulfilled: For there fell to <HI>Japhet</HI>'s Share, not only all <HI>Europe,</HI> so full of People, and <HI>Asia the less</HI> and <HI>Media</HI>

and Part of <HI>Armenia</HI> and <HI>Iberia</HI> and <HI>Albania;</HI> but also all those <HI>vast Northern Regions,</HI> inhabited once by the <HI>Scythians,</HI> who descended from <HI>Magog,</HI> one of the Sons of <HI>Japhet,</HI> as he is said to be in Gen. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 2. And pro∣bably <HI>this Western World,</HI> and that to a considerable Degree, came to his Share: For it is most likely, that <HI>This</HI> was at first much peopled by the <HI>Scythians: These,</HI> originally from <HI>Magog,</HI> were afterwards called <HI>Tartars;</HI> and so called, as some suppose, from the Name of the River <HI>Tartar</HI> or <HI>Tatar.</HI></P>
<P>As We find that <HI>the Earth was divided in the Days of</HI> Peleg; so we read, in Gen. ix. 19, that as there were <HI>three Sons of</HI> Noah; so <HI>of</HI> or <HI>from them the whole Earth was overspread or scattered.</HI> Nor is there any Reason to doubt, but that this Scattering was according to the direction of <HI>Noah,</HI> and from a Divine Warrant given him for this purpose: So then the Posterity of <HI>Japhet,</HI> by <HI>Magog,</HI> according to the Will of Heaven, took the primary Possession of this <HI>new World:</HI> And <HI>how great∣ly,</HI> how amazingly, was <HI>Japhet enlarged</HI> by this vast Acquisition?</P>
<P>But, after <HI>this first dispersion</HI> to the <HI>Western World,</HI> we readily grant, that there might be <HI>various Removals</HI> to it from various Nations: For after the <HI>Scythians</HI> or <HI>Tartars,</HI> were settled here; the <HI>Norwegians</HI> and <HI>Ice∣landers</HI> might come; and so might some of the <HI>Sinen∣sians</HI> from the East.</P>
<P>But some perhaps may say here, <HI>And how came they to this separate World?</HI> To which we answer, that there was no need at all of <HI>any Navigation</HI> for it: For it is apprehended by many, that the <HI>northern Part of</HI> Asia <HI>may be joined to</HI> America; or if they be divided at all, it must be by a very narrow Channel, which may be passed over easily in Boats or Canoes; or perhaps, as it is frozen over for a great Part of the Year, they might have a Passage across on Foot. <HI>Laet</HI> judged it
<PB N="16" REF="012861_0015_0F8B945243F559F8"/>
most probable, that it was by the <HI>Straits of</HI> Anian, that <HI>the Tartars</HI> in ancient Times passed out of <HI>Asia</HI> into <HI>America.</HI> But it is beyond all doubt, that, from the <HI>northern Parts of</HI> Europe, there might be an easy pas∣sing to America for at least three Quarters of a Year on a Bridge of substantial Ice.</P>
<P>Thus it looks as if the <HI>Northern Parts</HI> of America were <HI>first</HI> of all occupied and improved; and the In∣habitants of <HI>These</HI> might probably remove both to the <HI>Westward</HI> and to the <HI>Southward,</HI> as Occasion required.</P>
<P><HI>Herrera</HI> says, as quoted by <HI>Laet,</HI> <NOTE N="(r)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Laet.</HI> Descript. <HI>Americ.</HI></NOTE> that the Inhabi∣tants of the <HI>West Indies</HI> came hither <HI>by Land:</HI> Which may be true, if they be supposed to come from <HI>the Northern Parts of</HI> America. But, if he supposed them to come directly from <HI>Europe,</HI> it will be difficult to make it out. Nor can we find any Way for This, but by supposing <HI>the Atlantic Land,</HI> which <HI>Plato</HI> repre∣sents to be bigger than <HI>Asia and Libya</HI> together, might fill the <HI>Atlantic Ocean,</HI> even to the <HI>American</HI> Islands, if not beyond them: And, with this Allowance, <HI>Her∣rera</HI>'s observation might be true.</P>
<P>Besides what has been already observed about the <HI>peopling of the Western World,</HI> it may be remarked, for the prevention or removal of Mistakes, that, as <HI>Strabo</HI> has justly noted, there are many Places which were for∣merly Sea, that are now dry Land; <NOTE N="(s)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Strabon.</HI> Geograph. Lib. 1.</NOTE> so we may just∣ly note also, that there are now Seas, or Parts of Seas, where were dry Lands in former Times. <NOTE N="(t)" PLACE="foot"><L>Vidi ego quod quondam fuerat solidissima Tellus</L>
<L>Esse Freiam: Vidi factas ex oequore Terras.</L>
<BIBL><HI>Ovid. Metamorph. Lib. 15.</HI></BIBL></NOTE> Thus it has been thought by considerate and Judicious Persons, that <HI>Great Britain</HI> was formerly united to <HI>France,</HI> and the Island of <HI>Sicily</HI> to <HI>Italy.</HI> But all know, that they are not united now: For there are Parts of Seas be∣tween
<PB N="17" REF="012861_0016_0F8B9453178047F8"/>
them.—And it seems not at all improbable, that <HI>America</HI> might formerly be conjoined with <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Asia,</HI> if not to <HI>India,</HI> by vast Tracts of Land; which, from the Prevalence of <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> have sunk into the mighty Abyss: And thus has this <HI>Western World</HI> been disunited and separated from them.—Nor is it at all improbable, but that the great <HI>Atlantic Island</HI> of <HI>Plato;</HI> whereof <HI>one extreme Part was at Hercules</HI>'s <HI>Pillars,</HI> and bordering on <HI>Spain;</HI> and the <HI>other</HI> extend∣ed near to the <HI>American Continent,</HI> might in general sink; and <HI>the American Islands,</HI> if not those on the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> might remain out of the Ruins of it.</P>
<P>We have no Reason to think, that, in ancient Times, there were any Removes from <HI>Africa</HI> to <HI>America:</HI> For it is said, according to the ingenious Dr. <HI>Grew,</HI> that <HI>all over</HI> America <HI>there are no Blacks, but only</HI> at <HI>Qua∣veca.</HI>—And, if indeed there are any <HI>there;</HI> perhaps they are not originally from <HI>Africa;</HI> but from some Country in <HI>China</HI> under the <HI>Torrid Zone,</HI> where the People are of <HI>a black Complexion.</HI></P>
<P>Some have thought and suggested, but we think in∣judiciously, as <HI>John Lerius</HI> and others, that the <HI>Ame∣ricans</HI> were originally <HI>Canaanites,</HI> descended from <HI>Ham,</HI> the Son of <HI>Noah;</HI> and the Descendants of those, whom <HI>Joshua</HI> drove from their Seats in <HI>Canaan;</HI> who, being constrained to seek out new Regions, at length came and sat down on this Continent.</P>
<P>Here we shall readily allow, that the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> who were originally <HI>Canaanites,</HI> in the Days not much later than <HI>Moses</HI>'s, did sail into <HI>Spain:</HI> And as Part of these dispossessed <HI>Canaanites</HI> fled thither, so a Part of them went into <HI>Baeotia,</HI> and another Part into <HI>Af∣rica:</HI> And <HI>Procopius</HI> informs us of the Pillar to be seen about <HI>Tangier,</HI> which had inscribed on it, that they were <HI>of the Posterity of those, who fled from the Face of</HI> Joshua the Son of Nun, <HI>the Robber.</HI> And it is not
<PB N="18" REF="012861_0017_0F8B945377431458"/>
at all improbable, that, as these <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> or <HI>Canaan∣ites,</HI> might mingle with <HI>Japhet</HI>'s Posterity in <HI>Europe;</HI> so some of them might in Process of Time come to <HI>America</HI> by the Way of the Sea and settle here: For they were mightily for <HI>Navigation and Trade and Commerce.</HI></P>
<P>But some may ask; <HI>Where learned They the Art of Navigation?</HI> And how came they to understand <HI>the Use and Application of the Magnet?—Panormitan</HI> in∣deed would have it, that <HI>Amalphis</HI> first discovered the <HI>Use of the Loadstone</HI> to Mariners: And there is a Latin Line made to record the Discoverer, <HI>Prima dedit Nautis usum Magnetis</HI> Amalphis:—By which we are to understand an <HI>Italian City,</HI> where one <HI>John Goa,</HI> it is said, found out the Use of <HI>the Mariner's Compass,</HI> a∣bout the Year of our Lord 1302.—But the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> were generally thought to be <HI>the Inventers of the Ma∣riner's Art;</HI> and, from <HI>These,</HI> the <HI>Greeks</HI> received it; and, of <HI>these,</HI> the <HI>Cretans</HI> first of all, as <HI>Pliny</HI> acquaints us. But as the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> first tried the Seas among the Nations at Hand, and then afar off; so <HI>Thucydides</HI> tells us, that the <HI>Corinthians</HI> were the first among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> who performed Voyages:—</P>
<Q><L>—Primique per aequora vecti</L>
<L>Lustravere Salum; primum docuere, Carinis</L>
<L>Ferre cavis, orbis Commercia.</L></Q>
<P>The Voyage of <HI>Hanno,</HI> the <HI>Carthaginian,</HI> round the Coast of <HI>Africa,</HI> has already been mention'd: And surely <HI>This</HI> must discover <HI>no small Skill</HI> in Navigation. Nor have we any Doubt, that many of <HI>the Phoenicians</HI> were well skilled in <HI>the Mariner's Art:</HI> Nor yet is it any unreasonable Supposition, that they might sail to <HI>America,</HI> and make Settlements here.</P>
<P>Thus it appears with sufficient Probability, that <HI>Ame∣rica</HI> not very long after the Flood was settled; and that, after the first Settlement of it, there were successive
<PB N="19" REF="012861_0018_0F8B9454550F9230"/>
Removals to it, especially from the <HI>Northern Parts of Europe and Asia:</HI> And then, after some Ages had re∣volved, the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> might arrive and trade and settle here. And, by these various Ways, <HI>America</HI> became very well settled; and vast Numbers of Peo∣ple were found in this <HI>Western World,</HI> when <HI>Columbus, Americus and</HI> succeeding Voyagers came to it: And perhaps the Inhabitants here might, for their Numbers, vie with those of the other Continent.</P>
<P>But some may be ready to enquire, <HI>Whether we have any Proofs from the</HI> sacred Writings, <HI>that this Western World was known to</HI> the Ancients? And <HI>what Evi∣dences can be offered from them,</HI> to shew that it was so?</P>
<P>Now we do not presume to declare, that there is <HI>a clear, full and express Discovery of this Western Conti∣nent</HI> in the holy Writings.—But we may safely venture to affirm, that there are various Passages to be found in them, from which attentive and considerate Minds might form a Judgment, that <HI>there were Regions and great ones</HI> beyond those, that were known to them in <HI>Asia, Africa and Europe.</HI></P>
<P>Not to mention again the ancient Prophecy concern∣ing <HI>the Enlargement of</HI> Japhet; nor to recite the Prophe∣cy concerning <HI>Abraham,</HI> that <HI>in his Seed,</HI> the Messiah, <HI>all the Nations of the Earth,</HI> and hence the most remote Posterity of <HI>Magog, should be blessed;</HI> nor the positive and peremptory Engagement to the Messiah Himself, in Psal. xi. 8. that <HI>the uttermost Parts;</HI> or, as it is in the <HI>Hebrew, the Ends of the Earth, should be his Possession;</HI>—It is absolutely promised to the Messiah, that, after his Humiliation, as in Psal. xxii. 27, <HI>All the Ends of the World shall remember and turn to the Lord! and all the Kindreds of the Nations shall wor∣ship before Thee;</HI> or, as we may give the Verse more exactly according to the <HI>Hebrew, All the Ends of the Earth shall remember and be converted to</HI> Jehovah;
<PB N="20" REF="012861_0019_0F8B945690910EF0"/>
<HI>and all the Families of the Nations shall incline,</HI> or bow down, <HI>themselves to</HI> thy Face, i. e. <HI>to the Messiah,</HI> ex∣hibiting the Face of Jehovah.—Should any one here suggest, that <HI>This</HI> may mean, that not only the <HI>Hebrews,</HI> but <HI>the Nations</HI> around them, <HI>should believe and turn to the Lord and worship Him</HI> in and by the Messiah: We reply, that, although <HI>This</HI> may be Part of the Prophetical Meaning; yet the Sense of the Prophecy seems to be much more extensive:—<HI>All the Ends of the World and all the Families of the Nations:</HI>—These Expressions must certainly signifie the human Race wherever dispersed, and even to <HI>the remotest Parts of the Terraqueous Globe:</HI> And, to <HI>These,</HI> sensible and devout Minds might well stretched; when this Pro∣phecy was read by them with religious Care, Atten∣tion and Consideration.—And it is engaged, in Psalm lxvii. 2.5.7. <HI>To know thy Way in the Earth and thy Salvation, or</HI> thy Jesus, <HI>in all Nations;</HI> i. e. not only known, but unknown.—<HI>Let the People,</HI> or the People shall, <HI>confess to Thee,</HI> Elohim; <HI>to Thee let,</HI> or shall, <HI>all the People themselves confess — And all the Ends of the Earth shall fear Him</HI> —Surely neither <HI>the utmost Extent of Judea,</HI> nor <HI>the Extremities of the three</HI> great Divisions of the old World, <HI>and the People</HI> thereon will comprehend in them <HI>all the People</HI> of the World, <HI>and all the Ends of the Earth.</HI>—It is foretold, as if it were already accomplished, in Psalm xcviii. 3. <HI>All the Ends of the Earth have seen the Salvation,</HI> or thy Jesus, <HI>our Elobi.</HI>—So it is predicted, in Psalm cxiii. 3. <HI>From the Rising of the Sun to the</HI> going down <HI>of the same the LORD's Name is to be praised.</HI>—Again, there is a Prophetical Call, in Isa. xlii. 10. <HI>To sing a new Song to</HI> Jehovah; <HI>his Praise from the Extremity of the Earth; ye, that go down to</HI> to the Sea and all that is therein; the Isles and the Inhabitants thereof:—And it is the Call or Prophecy, in Isa. xlv. 22. <HI>Look ye to me, and be saved,</HI> all the Ends of the Earth, &amp;c.—So it is fore∣told, at the <HI>forsaking and punishing</HI> the Jews for their
<PB N="21" REF="012861_0020_0F8B94573B4E8690"/>
Iniquities, in Isa. lix. 19. <HI>They shall fear</HI> from the West <HI>the Name Jehovah, and</HI> from the East of the Sun <HI>his Glory:</HI>—Which is a Prophecy, that not only from <HI>the extremest Part of the East,</HI> but <HI>from the Western World,</HI> Jehovah, or the Messiah, should be acknow∣leged and glorified in a religious Manner.—But, that we may not be too tedious; we shall only add further the Prophecy of <HI>Malachi;</HI> in which, after <HI>the GOD of Israel</HI> had shewed his Dislike of the <HI>Israelitish Na∣tion</HI>
for their irreligious and profane Conduct, and his Purpose to cast them off for another and larger Peo∣ple; He says, as in Malach. i. 11. <HI>For, from the ri∣sing of the Sun even to his setting, great shall be my Name among the Nations,</HI> &amp;c. Could any of the <HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>jewish Proselytes,</HI> who lived, or conversed for a Season, on the <HI>Western</HI> Borders of <HI>Arabia</HI> or <HI>Africa,</HI> and <HI>saw the setting Sun,</HI> help imagining, from this Prophecy, that there were <HI>at the setting Sun, Nations</HI> to be brought to right Worship and Religion; Na∣tions, that lived vastly beyond the old World, of which they were the Inhabitants.</P>
<P>Upon the whole; If these Passages, as well as many others amounting to the same Purpose, be duly con∣sidered, it will in some Measure appear, that the <HI>Na∣tions, People and Families of this Western World</HI> are concerned in them.—But, if any think otherwise, it shall be owned as a Favour, if they will tell us, <HI>in what more full and expressive Words the Spirit of Prophecy could well discover</HI> the divine Intention and Purpose, <HI>that these Western Regions of the Earth,</HI> as well as the other Parts of the World, <HI>should be brought to the Knowlege, Worship and Service</HI> of the true GOD, ma∣nifesting Himself in and by the Messiah.—And we have no Doubt, that the more penetrating and judicious, if not among <HI>the Jews,</HI> who were of more narrow and contracted Minds, yet among the <HI>jewish Proselytes,</HI> understood the Meaning of these Prophecies to <HI>reach
<PB N="22" REF="012861_0021_0F8B945B7A2642D0"/>
beyond the old World,</HI> which they inhabited, <HI>to the World then not generally known,</HI> and the Nations and People inhabiting the same.</P>
<P>But at length the <HI>great Light of the World came to visit it; to give Light to them, that sit <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and the Shadow of Death, and guide their Feet in the Way of Peace:</HI> And, when He had been <HI>obedient to Death, even the Death of the Cross;</HI> and had <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> been <HI>delivered for our Offences,</HI> but <HI>raised again for our Justification;</HI> He then declared to his Apostles, that <HI>all Power in Heaven and Earth was committed</HI> to Him: And hence, in Virtue of his <HI>Divine Power and Authority,</HI> He commission his Apostles to <HI>go into all the World, and preach the Gospel to every</HI> human <HI>Creature:</HI> And, without <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Commission according to the Intent and Meaning of it.</P>
<P>It is very difficult for us, at this Time, to shew <HI>the Progress of the Apostles.</HI> But there is Reason to think, that, according to the Mind and Will of their Lord made known to them, they agreed among themselves, <HI>to which Parts of the Earth each of them should go;</HI> and how they should each of then, <HI>employ themselves within the Line,</HI> that was laid out for them.</P>
<P>Some have told us, that <HI>Philip</HI> went away to the <HI>upper Asia,</HI> and even to <HI>Scythia:</HI> And <HI>Nicephores</HI> re∣lates, that the Apostle <HI>Andrew</HI> is believed by some to have been sent to <HI>Coppadocia, Galatia, Bithynia, and the Western Parts.</HI> <NOTE N="(u)" PLACE="foot">Nicephor. Hist. Lib. 8. Cap. 6.</NOTE> But we place but very little Dependance on any such Accounts as these:—Although we a low, that there are some Evidences, that <HI>Thomas</HI> carried the Gospel to <HI>Eastern-India.</HI></P>
<P>Some of the ancient Fathers appear to be full and strong in Favour of it, that <HI>the Gospel was carried throughout the World</HI> by the Apostles of our blessed
<PB N="23" REF="012861_0022_0F8B945C44E2B798"/>
Lord.—<HI>Ignatius,</HI> in his Epistle to the <HI>Philadelphians,</HI> says, that <HI>it was so.—Tertullian</HI> observes, that <HI>the Places of</HI> Britain, <HI>which were inaccessible by the</HI> Romans, <HI>lay open to CHRIST.</HI>—And we may well ask, why might not other distant Places and even these remote Regions do so too?—<HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> shews us his Opinion, that <HI>the Doctrine of Salvation was by the divine Power and Co-operation carried into all the World. Julius Firmi∣cus Maturnus, who lived above</HI> 1400 <HI>Years ago,</HI> af∣firms, had <HI>there was no Nation under Heaven,</HI> East, West, North or South, <HI>unto whom the Sun of the Gospel had not shined.</HI> And <HI>Gregory Nyssen</HI> says, that the Gospel <HI>had been spread not only in the whole Continent, but in every Island also.</HI> And, in later Times, several Writers have asserted to the same Purpose. Thus <HI>Osiander,</HI> writing of <HI>Vilagagno,</HI> and his planting at <HI>Brasil,</HI> writes positively and confidently, <HI>without Doubt these Peo∣ple received the Gospel of CHRIST by the Preaching of the Apostles</HI> 1500 <HI>Years since.</HI></P>
<P>But, when we have better Proofs than merely human ones, it must certainly be fit and right to give <HI>These</HI> the Preference.</P>
<P>Now the Evangelist <HI>Mark</HI> informs us, in Chap. xvi. 20. that <HI>They,</HI> the Apostles, <HI>went forth and preached</HI> every where, <HI>the LORD working with</HI> them, &amp;c. i. e. They went, and performed, according to the Divine Direction. And the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> assures us, in Colos. i. 23. <HI>The Gospel ye have heard, which was preached to</HI> every Creature, which is under Heaven, &amp;c. And as He lets us know, in Rom. i. 8. that <HI>the Faith of the</HI> Romans <HI>was published in</HI> all the World; so He tells <HI>the Colossians</HI> most plainly and expresly, as in Col. i. 6. that <HI>the Word of Truth, the Gospel, was come not only to them, but</HI> in all the World, <HI>and bringeth forth Fruit,</HI> &amp;c. And our Apostle tells us, in Rom. x. 18. that, according to the ancient Prophecy of them, i. e. the Apostles, <HI>their Sound went into</HI> all the Earth, <HI>and
<PB N="24" REF="012861_0023_0F8B945C7ABEB240"/>
their Words to</HI> the Ends of the World. And indeed, if one Apostle <HI>from</HI> Jerusalem <HI>and round about even to</HI> Illyricum, <HI>fully preached the Gospel of CHRIST,</HI> or <HI>filled up the Gospel of CHRIST;</HI> so that all the Places between <HI>Jerusalem and Illyricum,</HI> and round about them, were <HI>fully gospelized by Him,</HI> as in Rom. xv. 19; we may reasonably think, that <HI>the rest of the Apostles</HI> with the <HI>Seventy Disciples, being alike indust∣rious and faithful</HI> in the Work of the Lord, must <HI>fully preach the Gospel</HI> even throughout the whole World.</P>
<P>But, if we think further with <HI>Eusebius,</HI> that, besides the <HI>Twelve Apostles, and the Seventy Disciples; there were more Apostles and Disciples:</HI> Which he gathers from that Passage of the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> in 1 Corinth. xv. 6. <HI>After that, he was seen of</HI> above five hund∣red Brethren <HI>at once; of whom</HI> the greater Part <HI>re∣main unto this present; but some are fallen asleep:</HI> <NOTE N="(w)" PLACE="foot"><HI>Euseb.</HI> Eccles. Hist. Lib. 1. Cap. 13.</NOTE>
Then there must be above <HI>two hundred and fifty Bre∣thren,</HI> besides the <HI>twelve Apostles</HI> and <HI>the Seventy Dis∣ciples,</HI> who had <HI>seen CHRIST,</HI> and could attest to the <HI>Truth and Certainty of his Resurrection,</HI> and so to the Divinity of his Religion: And a considerable Number of <HI>these</HI> might come to our <HI>Western World.</HI> And so <HI>America</HI> must have been filled up with the Gospel, according to our Apostle's Expression.</P>
<P>Some indeed have insisted on it, that the Passages con∣cerning the <HI>Gospel's coming in all the World, and going into all the Earth,</HI> and the like, only intend and mean the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> But if they will wrest <HI>these Passages</HI> to this Sense; it seems hard to force that Passage in the Epistle to the <HI>Colossians,</HI> above-cited, to that Meaning that <HI>the Gospel was preached to every Creature,</HI> that is, to every Man <HI>under Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>We do not now therefore concern ourselves so much <HI>Who were the bringers of the Gospel to this</HI> American
<PB N="25" REF="012861_0024_0F8B945DAB49E4D8"/>
World: But we think, that there is Reason to affirm from Divine Authority, that it <HI>was brought here by</HI> one or more of the Apostles and Disciples and many Brethren, <HI>and produced Fruit.</HI> And therefore this Con∣tinent must be certainly known to these <HI>first Preachers of the Gospel</HI> in it: And from them, without Doubt the Faith of the <HI>Americans</HI> was published in all the other World.</P>
<P>There is then, alas! too much Reason to believe, that this <HI>Western World</HI> sinned away the Gospel: And why should this be thought strange and incredible with us; when <HI>Africa,</HI> which for several Hundreds of Years after our <HI>Saviour</HI>'s Time, was enlightned with the Gospel and filled with Christian Societies, is now involved gen∣erally in Mahometan Glooms or Pagan Darknesses.</P>
<P>But however we have good Grounds for hoping, that <HI>the Gospel and Religion of Jesus</HI> will recover their lost Possession, and gain a more wide and extensive Spreading, than has yet been known in the later Ages and Generations: For it is foretold by the Spirit of Prophecy, in Habak. ii. 14. which we thus read ac∣cording to the <HI>Original Hebrew, The Earth shall be filled to know the Glory, JEHOVAH, as the Waters shall cover upon the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Now the LORD GOD ALMIGHTY grant, that <HI>this whole Continent,</HI> as well as the <HI>Old World,</HI> may find the fullest and most perfect Accomplishment of this <HI>good Word, on which He</HI> causes the Hearts of his People <HI>to hope</HI> and rest: And may <HI>all the People</HI> of the World unite in saying, AMEN.</P>

<P>IT may be proper and adviseable to add a few Things here, by Way of <HI>Appendix,</HI> which could not be so properly and conveniently introduced in the foregoing <HI>Essay.</HI> And indeed, as <HI>Divine Pro∣vidence,</HI> without my seeking for it, has furnished an <HI>Oc∣casion</HI> for mentioning some fit and right Things, with regard to these <HI>American Colonies, and some late Trans∣actions</HI> to their Disadvantage and Wrong; I cannot but think it my Duty to <HI>improve it;</HI> hoping, that none will be troubled or offended with me for so doing.

And the mentioning of <HI>This</HI> brings to Memory a Remark, that was made by the worthy Mr. <HI>Jeremy White</HI> but a little while before he made his Ex∣it out of the World. When he was asked, <HI>What he thought of these</HI> American Regions? After a little Pause he asked the Enquirer, <HI>Whence the wise Men came, who repaired to</HI> Judea, <HI>in order to shew their Respect and pay their Homage to</HI> the glorious King of the World? To which Question it was answered by the Gentleman, at whose House he then was, <HI>Why, Sir, from the East:</HI> Whereupon Mr. <HI>White</HI> remarked, <HI>And let me tell You, Sir, They have been travelling</HI> Westward <HI>ever since:</HI> And then he went on and gave it as his Judgment, that this Part of the World <HI>seemed to him to be reserved in Providence for the</HI> great Seat of Empire and Religi∣on and the Theatre of considerable Events before the End of the World.</P>
<P>In the published Account, concerning <HI>the Life</HI> of this learned and pious Gentleman, it is related, that, al∣though he lived to be near 80 Years of Age, <HI>He nei∣ther survived his Reason, his Chearfulness, his Memory, nor his Honour:</HI> And we may fitly add here, that the Remark above-mentioned, made by him towards the Close of his Life, shewed not only <HI>the Penetration of his Mind,</HI> but <HI>the Soundness of his Judgment also:</HI> And, as <HI>Cicero</HI> says, <HI>Dies—Naturae Judicia confirmat;</HI> which we may render, <HI>Time confirms the Judgments of Nature,</HI> or the Judgments formed from the Observation of Nature.</P>
<P>And now Things are tending apace towards the Completion of Mr. <HI>White</HI>'s Sentiments and Expectati∣ons; and, as we apprehend, to the Fulfilment of sun∣dry Predictions in <HI>the more sure Word of Prophecy</HI> con∣cerning the Prevalence of the Redeemer's Kingdom <HI>in the West and to the Goings down of the Sun,</HI> and <HI>the filling of the Whole Earth with his Glory.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="012861_0027_0F8B9462D7B73E48"/>These Parts of the World seem to have been designed of Heaven for an <HI>Asylum,</HI> a Place of Rest and Refresh∣ment, to those, who have been oppressed and groaning under the Tyranny of <HI>Political and Ecclesiastical Power:</HI> And as Thousands and Thousands of <HI>These,</HI> have al∣ready escaped out of the Clutches of their merciless and cruel Oppressors; and found Respite, Ease and Com∣fort in these fertile and wholesome Regions; so it may be reasonably expected, that <HI>many Thousands more</HI> will voluntarily and chearfully resort here with the same Views and Intentions and to good Effect; notwith∣standing all the Lets and Impediments, which may be thrown in their Way by oppressive, and therefore weak and foolish, <HI>Politicians and Priests.</HI></P>
<P>But there have been some Methods used, not only of <HI>low Art,</HI> but of <HI>rash Force and Violence</HI> in later Times, to <HI>abridge the Freedoms,</HI> and cramp the Im∣provements of these Colonies: So that, was the Old Latin Poet <HI>Ennius</HI> now living, he would write as he did in his own Day,
<Q>Tollitur e medio <HI>Sapientia: Vi</HI> geritur Res:</Q></P>
<P>Which may be thus translated for the English Reader,
<Q><L>Wisdom is taken from it's usual Course:</L>
<L>Things now are manag'd by <HI>ungrateful</HI> Force.</L></Q></P>
<P>The <HI>Contriv<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs and Prosecutors</HI> of these Methods of treating <HI>free People,</HI> who are entitled to <HI>all the Privi∣ledges of Britons,</HI> as much as <HI>Britons themselves;</HI> and who, if I know them, will, at all Hazards, surely recover and retain these, maugre all the Counsels and Attempts against them; the <HI>Contrivers and Prosecu∣tors</HI> of these Methods, we say, discover most egregi∣ous <HI>Ignorance</HI> of their <HI>American Brethren and their Rights:</HI> And, if <HI>This</HI> were all, it might easily be piti∣ed and overlooked. But there seems at the same Time
<PB N="29" REF="012861_0028_0F8B9465146B8DE8"/>
to be so much <HI>Malevolence and Enmity</HI> manifested to∣wards the <HI>natural and constitutional Rights and Liber∣ties</HI> of the <HI>Americans,</HI> as cannot well admit of any just Apology, or fair Excuse.</P>
<P>We have no Inclination to concern ourselves so far as to treat largely concerning <HI>the Legislative Authority of</HI> Great Britain. Let This be called <HI>Supreme</HI> by its Favourers; and let it be magnified in all other Re∣gards and to the uttermost Degree by them, if they please: But, with their Leave, <HI>it is not extended, nor can it</HI> constitutionally <HI>be,</HI> to the Affair of <HI>Taxation,</HI> as all <HI>Britons</HI> know, or might know if they would: For <HI>the Commons</HI> of Great Britain have <HI>the sole Right of taxing the People,</HI> whom they represent: <HI>This Right</HI> was recovered upon the <HI>Revolution:</HI> And, ever since that Time, <HI>the Commons</HI> have steadily exercised it. It is allowed, that, as <HI>Tax Bills</HI> are sent up to <HI>the Lords and Crown, They accept of them,</HI> just as they are brought to them, according to the Formality of Law: For otherwise the Monies granted cannot be had, and ap∣plied to the public Use and Service.—But, after all, <HI>the Taxation itself, and the Gift of the Monies,</HI> is by <HI>the Commons,</HI> in the Name and Behalf of the People of <HI>Britain.</HI></P>
<P>Now <HI>the Americans,</HI> and <HI>their Commons,</HI> as Judge <HI>Blackstone</HI> calls our <HI>General Assemblies,</HI> cannot see, <HI>what Right the</HI> Commons <HI>of</HI> Britain <HI>have to take their Mo∣nies</HI> from them, and apply them to such Uses as they judge proper. Nay they have over and over again unanswerably proved, that they <HI>have not the Right to</HI> do so: For indeed, if they have it, certainly we poor <HI>Americans</HI> must be <HI>destitute of the Rights and Privi∣leges of</HI> Englishmen, to which we are fully entitled: And, if <HI>This</HI> be our Case, it must be disreputable and ignominious both <HI>to them and their American Brethren: To them,</HI> that they deprive us of the Rights and Liber∣ties justly belonging to us; and to their <HI>American Bre∣thren,</HI>
<PB N="30" REF="012861_0029_0F8B9465980DB318"/>
who have dearly purchased them, and never have yet forfeited them; but have rather deserved an Addition to them by our Exertions.</P>
<P>And yet <HI>the Majority</HI> of a certain great Assembly have peremptorily resolved, that <HI>They have Authority to make Laws binding on the Colonies</HI> in all Cases what∣soever: So then They thus assert their Authority, a∣mong other Things, <HI>to tax us when, and how, and as often and as much as they please.</HI></P>
<P>Upon which, if it should be enquired, <HI>By what Au∣thority they</HI> thus <HI>resolved? And who gave them that Authority?</HI> It is probable, that they could give no sufficient and satisfactory Answer. Certainly the <HI>Ame∣ricans</HI> never gave them such Authority; and the Peo∣ple of <HI>Britain</HI> never could give them such Authority: For they never had it to give.</P>
<P>But it deserves some particular Notice here, that they were so cautious and reserved as not to say, that <HI>they had the Right,</HI> or <HI>rightful Authority, to make such Laws:</HI> And hence it may very fitly be presumed, that they <HI>knew in their own Souls, that they had no such Right, or rightful Authority;</HI> and therefore they would not declare, that it belonged to them.</P>
<P>Many judicious Persons here are of the Mind, and have often expressed it, that it would have been better if the Majority had not boasted of their <HI>absolute Au∣thority, nor indeed resolved any Thing at all about</HI> it: For, in Truth, <HI>the Saying and Resolving,</HI> that <HI>they have such Authority, is no Proof at all</HI> of their being in the rightful Possession of it.—And <HI>the Methods,</HI> which have been taken for supporting their <HI>asserted Authority,</HI> have no Tendency to produce <HI>any Approbation of it, or real Regard to it.</HI> But, as <HI>the Claim</HI> of such an Authority by a <HI>British Senate</HI> must be deemed absurd and wrong by the most understanding <HI>Britons them∣selves;</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="012861_0030_0F8B94665E9187F0"/>
so <HI>the rough Managements</HI> to support and e∣stablish <HI>it</HI> are judged, by <HI>the Americans</HI> in general, to be contrary to Reason, Right and Equity.—And <HI>all the Military Force,</HI> which can be sent for its Support, will only serve to confirm and establish these Colonies in their real Apprehensions, that <HI>wrong and unrighte∣ous,</HI> as well <HI>as weak and foolish, Measures</HI> are used with them; and <HI>These,</HI> as they think, from such <HI>illiberal Motives,</HI> as wise Men will find it very difficult to justi∣fie, or even to palliate.</P>
<P>Although it has been readily and cheerfully granted, that <HI>the British House of Commons have the undoubted Right and sole Power and Authority of</HI> taxing the Peo∣ple, their Brethren, at Home; yet we conceive it to be a most <HI>unreasonable and unrighteous Stretch of the Authority,</HI> which is claimed by them, <HI>to exercise it in taxing the People of</HI> America:—For it is most sure and certain, that <HI>the Americans</HI> have never <HI>chosen</HI> them for their Representatives; and it is reasonable to think, that they <HI>never will chuse</HI> them as such: Because they cannot well be accountable to them for their public Conduct and Managements; nor can they well be treated by them according to their good or evil De∣servings from them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Americans</HI> consider it as <HI>very disingenuous</HI> to treat them in such an unfit and severe Manner, by <HI>ini∣quitous Laws and rigorous Executions</HI> of them; when They, especially of <HI>New England,</HI> have at their own Expence settled <HI>a great Continent,</HI> so much to the Advantage of <HI>Britain,</HI> and to our Loss, in the Way of <HI>Trade and Commerce;</HI> and by means of which <HI>Great Britain</HI> is made so wealthy at Home, and so much re∣spected and esteemed by her sorrounding Neighbours.— Nor have they only <HI>settled</HI> this vast Continent to a con∣siderable Degree; but, by the Expence of <HI>much Trea∣sure and much Blood,</HI> they have maintained the Pos∣session to the Emolument of <HI>Britons:</HI> And why? It
<PB N="32" REF="012861_0031_0F8B946A839995C8"/>
was all for the sake of <HI>enjoying those Rights and Privileges,</HI> which are now scandalously begrutched to them, and insidiously and wrongfully wrested from them.</P>
<P>The <HI>Colonists</HI> also think, that the Managements a∣gainst them are <HI>impolitic and imprudent,</HI> as well as <HI>dis∣ingenuous and unfair:</HI> For, it <HI>New England alone,</HI> by Divine Providence favouring their Expedition against <HI>Louisburgh</HI> in the Year 1745, <HI>gave Protection to</HI> Great Britain <HI>and Peace to</HI> Europe; is it not highly proba∣ble, that <HI>they,</HI> with the <HI>other Colonies,</HI> both may and will be greatly serviceable in future to their <HI>Mother Country,</HI> unless they be discouraged and hindred from being so by unkind and injurious Treatment? And must it not therefore be for <HI>the Interest</HI> of <HI>Great Bri∣tain</HI> to lighten them of the heavy Burdens put upon them, and not to leave so much as one on them?— Certainly then it must be <HI>their Wisdom</HI> to do this for them.</P>
<P>Besides, The <HI>Americans</HI> sincerely think, that <HI>the Im∣position and Continuance of such Burdens</HI> on them is a direct and continued <HI>Breach of the public Faith:</HI> For the <HI>Americans,</HI> especially of <HI>the Charter Governments, were solemnly promised, that they and their Posterity forever should enjoy all the Rights and Privileges of Englishmen;</HI> upon Condition, that, at their own Ex∣pence, they would settle and improve such and such Territories, as should be purchased by them in <HI>America.</HI> Now it is beyond all Dispute, that the <HI>Americans</HI> have fulfilled their Part of the Contract: And therefore <HI>the depriving of them</HI> of the stipulated Rights and Liberties, and even the <HI>Abridgment of these,</HI> should not be me∣ditated, and much less resolved on and executed, <HI>by Christianized Britons:</HI> For even <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Pagans</HI> would be ashamed to perpetrate such a shameful <HI>Breach of public Faith:</HI> And therefore it may be well and reasonably expected, that, wherein there has been <HI>any
<PB N="33" REF="012861_0032_0F8B946B363E5658"/>
such Thing,</HI> or <HI>an Appearance of it,</HI> there should be an honest and manly Resolution not to abide by it: For such a Resolution, instead of dishonouring any Body of Men, would render them more amiable, excellent and illustrious in the Estimation of the whole World.</P>
<P>Moreover; The Colonists judge, that <HI>the British Commons</HI> have dealt with them, in their modern Ma∣nagements, not according to the <HI>golden Rule of Equity:</HI> For certainly <HI>the British Commons,</HI> were <HI>They in</HI> our <HI>Situation and Circumstances,</HI> and We in theirs, <HI>would not think it just and right for themselves to receive such Treatment</HI> from us, as they judge proper to give unto us.</P>
<P>The <HI>Americans</HI> therefore, upon such Considerations as have been mentioned, are ready to exclaim with regard to the unfit, unkind and injurious Dealings to∣wards them by their Brethren: <HI>Oh! the Times! Oh! the Manners!</HI> For they think it wrong, that any Men should exert, if they have it, such an undue Influence as <HI>to remove the ancient Landmarks</HI> of English Freedom, as well as of Truth and Righteousness: And they look on it as unaccountable and astonishing, that any such Things should be <HI>acted,</HI> or <HI>tamely suffered,</HI> by <HI>Great Britain.</HI> Yea the <HI>Colonists</HI> scruple not to speak out the Language of the <HI>Tragic Poet</HI> in the <HI>Christian Hero:</HI></P>
<Q><L>O! Is it not, that <HI>Tyranny prevails,</HI></L>
<L>And the true <HI>End of Government</HI> is lost!</L>
<L>That those, who should defend each in his Right,</L>
<L>Betray their Trust, and seize upon the Whole!</L>
<L>This, this is to rebel against that Power,</L>
<L>By which Kings reign; and turns the Arms of Heaven</L>
<L>Against itself.</L></Q>
<P>Thus a few Things, of no small Importance, have been offered by Way of <HI>Apology</HI> for <HI>the Americans:</HI>
<PB N="34" REF="012861_0033_0F8B946BC228CF88"/>
And where is the Hurt, or Impropriety, of my offer∣ing <HI>this Apology</HI> for their Rights and Liberties; any more than in <HI>Justin Marty</HI>'s, <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s, <HI>Athenago∣ras</HI>'s, and other Writers in the primitive Church, ten∣dering <HI>their Apologies</HI> for their Christian Brethren to the <HI>Roman Emperors and Senates?</HI> And, if <HI>this At∣tempt,</HI> in Conjunction with those of <HI>others,</HI> should meet with Acceptance; and my Country, with the other Colonies, should fare in any Measure the better for it, it will be a great Comfort to me at the <HI>Setting of my Life,</HI> and cause me to quit the Stage with more Com∣posure and Satisfaction; because <HI>due Freedom is re∣stored to</HI> America, <HI>and there is a comfortable Prospect of its descending</HI> to our latest Posterity.</P>
<P>But, if notwithstanding all, that has been so clearly and fully, so rationally and judiciously argued against the late Innovations, by <HI>particular Persons</HI> of various Orders, and by such respectable Bodies of Men as <HI>Councils and Representatives, Might</HI> must be still ex∣ercised for subverting and <HI>overpowering American Right;</HI> We think, and are fully persuaded, that the generous and brave <HI>Americans</HI> will be <HI>disposed and re∣solved to defend</HI> themselves and their Rights, and <HI>pre∣pare</HI> in the best Manner they can for doing so: And, if Things, from unadvised and rash Measures still used, must be brought to a desperate Crisis, the <HI>Colonists</HI> will make their Appeal to HIM, who is <HI>higher than the Highest,</HI> or supremest, on the Earth; who, as He <HI>always judges righteously,</HI> always <HI>loveth Righteousness and hateth Oppression</HI> and all Manner of Iniquity: And they will <HI>hope and trust in HIM, as their Cause is just and right, to own and succeed it: For JUST &amp; RIGHT is HE.</HI></P>
<P>In the mean while may an <HI>English American,</HI> suita∣bly to his Profession and public Business, be allowed to call upon all his <HI>American Brethren,</HI> while endeavouring <HI>to do their Duty to their GOD and their King,</HI> as well
<PB N="35" REF="012861_0034_0F8B946C3AB893D8"/>
as <HI>themselves and their Country,</HI> in all Respects and In∣stances, <HI>to pray constantly and most humbly and earnest∣ly</HI> to the gracious <HI>Parent and glorious Lord of the Uni∣verse!</HI></P>
<P><HI>O Thou most supreme Lover and eternal Doer of Right, and Avenger of Wrongs: Shine forth, and arise, and stir up thy Strength, and come &amp; save us: Maintain our Cause against them, that would strive with us: Take hold of Shield and Buckler, and stand up for our Help: For our Help is in the Name of the LORD, who made Heaven and Earth: Wherefore help us, O our GOD, and save us according to thy Mercy; and say unto us,</HI> I am thy Salvation: <HI>For we trust in thy Power and Mercy through the only Mediator, our Strength and Re∣deemer: To whom be Glory throughout all Ages:</HI> AMEN.</P>
