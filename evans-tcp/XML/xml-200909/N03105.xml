<PB N="8" REF="003744_0008_100254F5D6946928"/>drawn forth into a convenient Method of <HI>Propositions,</HI> by observing the Laws of <HI>Proportion</HI> taken from <HI>Me∣chanism:</HI> So that as the <HI>Mechanical Arts</HI> gave Occasion to the Learned to reduce the Elements of <HI>Geometry</HI> into Method, this noble Science thus reduc'd, is the Foundation of all those Arts, (particularly of <HI>Masonry</HI> and <HI>Architecture</HI>) and the Rule by which they are con∣ducted and perform'd.</P>
<P>No doubt <HI>Adam</HI> taught his Sons <HI>Geometry,</HI> and the use of it, in the serveral <HI>Arts</HI> and <HI>Crafts</HI> convenient, at least for those early Times; for CAIN, we find, built a City, which he call'd CONSECRATED, or DEDICATED, after the Name of his eldest Son ENOCH; and becoming the Prince of the one Half of Mankind, his Posterity would imitate his royal Ex∣ample in improving both the noble Science and the useful Art.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As other Arts were also improved by them, <HI>viz.</HI> working in Metal by <HI>TUBAL CAIN, Music</HI> by <HI>JUBAL, Pastorage</HI> and <HI>Tent-Making</HI> by <HI>JABAL;</HI> which last is good <HI>Architecture.</HI></NOTE></P>
<P>Nor can we suppose that SETH was less instructed, who being the Prince of the other Half of Mankind, and also the prime Cultivator of <HI>Astronomy,</HI> would take equal care to teach <HI>Geometry</HI> and <HI>Masonry</HI> to his Offspring, who had also the mighty Advantage of <HI>Adam's</HI> living among them.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">For by some Vestices of Antiquity c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> fird one of 'em, godly <HI>ENOCH</HI> (who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot, bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was translated alive to Heaven, proph<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of the <HI>final Conflagration</HI> at the Day of Judgment as <HI>St</HI> Jude <HI>tells us</HI>) and likewise of the <HI>General De∣luge</HI> for the Punishment of the World: Upon which he erected his two large Pillars, the some es<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ribe them to <HI>Seth</HI>) the one of <HI>Stone,</HI> and the other of <HI>Brick,</HI> whereon were engraven the Liberal Sciences, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that the <HI>Stone Pillar</HI> remain'd in S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>la until the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Vespasian</HI> the Emperor.</NOTE></P>

But without regarding uncertain Accounts, we may safely conclude the <HI>old World,</HI> that lasted 1656 Years, could not be ignorant of <HI>Masonry;</HI> and that both the Familles of <HI>Seth</HI> and <HI>Cain</HI> erected many curious Works, until at length NOAH, the ninth from <HI>Seth,</HI> was com∣manded and directed of God to build the <HI>great Ark,</HI> which, tho' of Wood, was certainly fabricated by <HI>Geometry,</HI> and according to the Rules of <HI>Masonry.</HI></P>
<P>NOAH, and his three Sons, JAPHET, SHEM, and HAM, all <HI>Masons true,</HI> brought with them over the <HI>Flood</HI> the Traditions and Arts of the <HI>Ante-deluvians,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">Anno Mundi 1757. 2247.

And tho' they carry'd on the Work to a monstrous Height, and by their Va∣nity provok'd God to confound their Devices, by con∣founding their Speech, which occasion'd their Disper∣sion;<NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M 1810. 2194. Ante Chr.</NOTE> yet their Skill in <HI>Masonry</HI> is not the less to be celebrated, having spent above 53 Years in that pro∣digious Work, and upon their Dispersion carry'd the mighty Knowledge with them into distant Parts, where they sound the good Use of it in the Settlement of their <HI>Kingdoms, Commonwealths,</HI> and <HI>Dynasties.</HI> And tho' afterwards it was lost in most Parts of the Earth, it was especially preserv'd in <HI>Shinar</HI> and <HI>Assyria,</HI> where
<PB N="10" REF="003744_0010_100254FB43FBCA68"/>NIMROD,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>NIMROD,</HI> which signifies a <HI>Rebel,</HI> was the Name given him by the holy Family<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and by <HI>Moses;</HI> but among his Friends in <HI>Chaldea,</HI> his proper Name was <HI>BELUS,</HI> which signifies <HI>LORD;</HI> and afterwards was worshipped as a God by many Nations, under the Name of <HI>Bel</HI> or <HI>Baal,</HI> and became the <HI>Bacchus</HI> of the Ancients, or <HI>Bar Chus,</HI> the Son of <HI>CHUS.</HI></NOTE> the Founder of that Monarchy, after the Dispersion, built many splendid Cities, as <HI>Ereck, Accad,</HI> and <HI>Calneh,</HI> in SHINAR; from whence afterwards he went forth into ASSYRIA, and built <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iniveh, Reho∣both, Caleh,</HI> and <HI>Rhesin.</HI></P>
<P>In these Parts, upon the <HI>Tygris</HI> and <HI>Euphrates,</HI> after∣wards flourish'd many learned <HI>Priests</HI> and <HI>Mathematicians,</HI> known by the Names of CHALDEES and MAGI, who preserv'd the good Science, <HI>Geometry,</HI> as the KINGS and <HI>great Men</HI> encourag'd the <HI>Royal Art.</HI> But it is not expe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ent to speak more plain of the Premises, except in a <HI>formed Lodge.</HI></P>
<P>From hence, therefore, the <HI>Science</HI> and <HI>Art</HI> were both transmitted to latter Ages and distant Climes, notwith∣standing the Consusion of Languages or Dialects, which tho' it might help to give Rise to the Masons Faculty and ancient universal Practice of conversing without speaking, and of knowing each other at a Distance, yet hinder'd not the Improvement of <HI>Masonry</HI> in each Colony and their <HI>Communication</HI> in their distinct Nati∣onal Dialect.</P>
<P>And, no doubt, the Royal Art was brought down to <HI>Egypt</HI> by MITZRAIM, the second Son of <HI>Ham,</HI> about six Years after the Confusion at <HI>Babel,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A. M. 1816. 2188. Ante Chr.</NOTE> and after the <HI>Flood</HI> 160 Years, when he led thither his Colony; (for <HI>Egypt</HI> is <HI>Mitzraim</HI> in <HI>Hebrew</HI>) because we find the
<PB N="11" REF="003744_0011_100254FCDC244CC8"/>River <HI>Nile</HI>'s overflowing its Banks, soon caus'd an Im∣provement in <HI>Geometry,</HI> which consequently brought <HI>Masonry</HI> much in request: For the ancient noble Cities, with the other magnificent Edifices of that Country, and particularly the <HI>famous</HI> PYRAMIDS, demonstrate the early Taste and Genius of that ancient Kingdom. Nay, one of those <HI>Egyptian</HI> PYRAMIDS<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Marble Stones, brought a vast way from the Quarries of <HI>Arabia,</HI> were most of 'em <HI>30</HI> Foot long; and its Foundation cover'd the Ground <HI>700</HI> Foot on each Side, or <HI>2800</HI> Foot in Compass, and <HI>481</HI> in perpendecular Height. And in porjecting it were employ'd every Day, for <HI>20</HI> whole Years, <HI>360,000</HI> Men, by some ancient <HI>Egyptian King</HI> long before the <HI>Israelites</HI> were a People, for the Honour of his Em∣pire, and at last to become his <HI>Tomb.</HI></NOTE> is reckon'd the <HI>First</HI> of the <HI>Seven Wonders</HI> of the World, the Ac∣count of which, by Historians and Travellers, is almost incredible.</P>
<P>The Sacred Records inform us well that the eleven <HI>great Sons</HI> of CANAAN (the youngest Son of <HI>Ham</HI>) soon fortified themselves in strong Holds, and stately walled Cities, and erecred most beautiful Temples and Mansions; for when the <HI>Israetites,</HI> under the great <HI>Joshua,</HI> invaded their Country, they found it so regu∣larly fenc'd, that without the immediate Intervention of God in behalf of his peculiar People, the <HI>Canaanites</HI> were impregnable and invincible. Nor can we suppose less of the other Sons of <HI>Ham, viz. Cush,</HI> his eldest, in <HI>South Arabia,</HI> and <HI>Phut,</HI> or <HI>Phuts,</HI> (now called <HI>Fez</HI>) in <HI>West Africa.</HI></P>
<P>And surely the fair and gallant Posterity of JA∣PHET, (the eldest Son of <HI>Noah</HI>) even such as travell'd into the Isles of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> must have been equally skill'd in <HI>Geometry</HI> and <HI>Masonry;</HI> tho' we know little
<PB N="12" REF="003744_0012_100254FEB5A53720"/>of their Transactions and mighty Works, until their original Knowledge was almost lost by the Havock of War, and by not maintaining a due Correspondence with the polite and learned Nations; for when that Correspondence was open'd in After-Ages, we find they began to be most curious Architects.</P>
<P>The Posterity of SHEM had also equal Opportuni∣ties of cultivating the useful <HI>Art,</HI> even those of 'em that planted their Colonies in the South and East of <HI>Asia;</HI> much more those of 'em, that in the great <HI>Assyrian</HI> Empire, liv'd in a separate State, or were blended with other Families: Nay, that <HI>holy Branch</HI> of SHEM (of whom, as concerning the Flesh, CHRIST came) could not be unskilful in the learned Arts of <HI>Assyria;</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

<P>Indeed the select Family long used <HI>Military Archi∣tecture</HI> only, as they were Sojourners among Strangers; out before the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>30 Years of their <HI>Peregrination</HI> were expired,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

<PB N="13" REF="003744_0013_1002550127F16338"/>make them good <HI>Masons</HI> before they possess'd the promis'd Land, then famous for most curious <HI>Ma∣sonry.</HI></P>
<P>And while marching to <HI>Canaan</HI> thro' <HI>Arabia,</HI> un∣der <HI>Moses,</HI> God was pleased to inspire BEZALEEL, of the Tribe of <HI>Judah,</HI> and AHOLIAB, of the Tribe of <HI>Dan,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

<P>So that the <HI>Israelites,</HI> at their leaving <HI>Egypt,</HI> were a whole Kingdom of <HI>Masons,</HI> well instructed, under the Conduct of their GRAND MASTER MOSES, who often marshall'd them into a regular and <HI>general Lodge,</HI> while in the Wilderness, and gave them wise <HI>Charges, Orders, &amp;c</HI> had they been well observ'd! But no more of the Premises must be mention'd.</P>
<P>And after they were possess'd of <HI>Canaan,</HI> the <HI>Israe∣lites</HI> came not short of the old Inhabitants in <HI>Masonry,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">A.

<HEAD>I. <HI>Concerning</HI> GOD <HI>and</HI> RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Mason</HI> is oblig'd, by his Tenure, to obey the mo∣ral Law; and if he rightly understands the Art, he will never be a stupid <HI>Atheist,</HI> nor an irreligious <HI>Liber∣tine.</HI> But though in ancient Times Masons were charg'd in every Country to be of the Religion of that Country or Nation, whatever it was, yet 'tis now thought more expedient only to oblige them to that Religion in which all Men agree, leaving their parti∣cular Opinions to themselves; that is, to be <HI>good Men and true,</HI> or Men of Honour and Honesty, by whatever Denominations or Persuasions they may distinguish'd; whereby Masonry becomes the <HI>Center</HI> of <HI>Union,</HI> and the Means of conciliating true Friendship among Persons that must else have remain'd at a perpetual Distance.</P>

<HEAD><HI>II.</HI> Of the <HI>CIVIL MAGISTRATE</HI> supreme and Jubordinate.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Mason</HI> is a peaceable Subject to the Civil Powers, wherever he resides or works, and is never to be con∣cern'd in Plots and Conspiracies against the Peace and Welfare of the Nation, nor to behave himself undu∣tiful to inferior Magistrates: for as Masonry hath been always injured by War, Bloodshed, and Confusion,
<PB N="49" REF="003744_0049_1002555D48B589B8"/>so ancient Kings and Princes have been much dis∣pos'd to encourage the Craftsmen, because of their Peaceableness and <HI>Loyalty,</HI> whereby they practically answer'd the Cavils of their Adversaries, and promo∣ted the Honour of the Fraternity, who ever flourish'd in Times of Peace. So that if a Brother should be a Rebel against the State, he is not to be countenanc'd in his Rebellion, however he may be pitied as an un∣happy Man; and if convicted of no other Crime, though the loyal Brotherhood must and ought to dis∣own his Rebellion, and give no Umbrage or Ground of political Jealousy to the Government for the time being; they cannot expel him from the <HI>Lodge,</HI> and his Relation to it remains indeseasible.</P>

<HEAD>III. <HI>Of</HI> LODGES.</HEAD>
<P>A LODGE is a Place where <HI>Masons</HI> assemble and work: Hence that Assembly, or duly organiz'd So∣ciety of Masons, is call'd a LODGE, and every Bro∣ther ought to belong to one, and to be subject to its <HI>By-Laws</HI> and the GENERAL REGULATIONS. It is either <HI>particular</HI> or <HI>general,</HI> and will be best un∣destood by attending it, and by the Regulations of the <HI>General</HI> or <HI>Grand Lodge</HI> hereunto annex'd. In ancient Times no <HI>Master</HI> or <HI>Fellow</HI> could be absent from it, especially when warn'd to appear at it, without in∣curring a severe Censure, until it appear to the <HI>Ma∣ster</HI> and <HI>Wardens,</HI> that pure Necessity hinder'd him.</P>
<P>The Persons admitted Members of a <HI>Lodge</HI> must be good and true Men, free-born, and of mature and

<P>The most expert of the <HI>Fellow-Craftsmen</HI> shall be chosen or appointed the <HI>Master,</HI> or Overseer of the <HI>Lord's</HI> Work; who is to be call'd MASTER by those that work under him. The <HI>Craftsmen</HI> are to avoid all ill Language, and to call each other by no diso∣bliging

<P>When a <HI>Fellow-Craftsman</HI> is chosen <HI>Warden</HI> of the Work under the <HI>Master,</HI> he shall be true both to <HI>Ma∣ster</HI> and <HI>Fellows,</HI> shall carefully oversee the Work in the <HI>Master</HI>'s Absence to the <HI>Lord</HI>'s Profit; and his Brethren shall obey him.</P>

<P>You may enjoy yourselves with innocent Mirth, treating one another according to Ability, but avoid∣ing all Excess, or forcing any Brother to eat or drink beyond his Inclination, or hindering him from going when his Occasions call him, or doing or saying any thing offensive, or that may forbid an <HI>easy</HI> and <HI>free</HI> Conversation; for that would blast our Harmony, and defeat our laudable Purposes. Therefore no pri∣vate Piques or Quarrels must be brought within the Door of the <HI>Lodge,</HI> far less any Quarrels about <HI>Religi∣on,</HI> or <HI>Nations,</HI> or <HI>State-Policy,</HI> we being only, as <HI>Ma∣sons,</HI> of the <HI>Catholick Religion</HI> above-mention'd; we are also of all <HI>Nations, Tongues, Kindreds,</HI> and <HI>Languages,</HI> and are resolv'd against all <HI>Politicks,</HI> as what never yet conduc'd to the Welfare of the <HI>Lodge,</HI> nor ever will.

<P>But if you discover him to be a true and genuine <HI>Brother,</HI> you are to respect him accordingly; and if he is in want, you must relieve him if you can, or else direct him how he may be reliev'd: You must employ him some Days, or else recommend him to be employ'd.

<PB N="60" REF="003744_0060_10025577580E3400"/>his <HI>Grand-Wardens</HI> to attend him, who are not to act in particular <HI>Lodges</HI> as <HI>Wardens,</HI> but in his Presence, and at his Command; because there the GRAND-MASTER may command the <HI>Wardens</HI> of that <HI>Lodge,</HI> or any other Brethren he pleaseth, to attend and act as his <HI>Wardens pro tempore.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. The MASTER of a particular <HI>Lodge</HI> has the Right and Authority of congregating the Members of his <HI>Lodge</HI> into a <HI>Chapter</HI> at pleasure, upon any Emergency or Occurrence, as well as to appoint the time and place of their usual forming: And in case of Sickness, Death, or necessary Absence of the <HI>Master,</HI> the senior <HI>War∣den</HI> shall act as <HI>Master pro tempore,</HI> if no Brother is present who has been <HI>Master</HI> of that <HI>Lodge</HI> before; for in that Case the <HI>absent Master</HI>'s Authority reverts to the last <HI>Master</HI> then present; though he cannot act until the said <HI>senior Warden</HI> has once congregated the <HI>Lodge,</HI> or in his Absence the <HI>junior Warden.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. The <HI>Master</HI> of each particular <HI>Lodge,</HI> or one of the <HI>Wardens,</HI> or some other Brother by his Order, shall <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ep a Book containing their <HI>By-Laws,</HI> the Names of their Members, with a List of all the <HI>Lodges</HI> in Town, and the usual Times and Places of their form∣ing, and all their Transactions that are proper to be written.</P>
<P N="4">IV. No <HI>Lodge</HI> shall make more than FIVE <HI>new Bre∣thren</HI> as one Time, nor any Man under the Age of <HI>Twenty-five,</HI> who must be also his own Master; unless by a Dispensation from the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> or his <HI>Deputy.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. No Man can be made or admitted a Member of a particular <HI>Lodge,</HI> without previous notice <HI>one
<PB N="61" REF="003744_0061_100255791219AAC0"/>Month before</HI> given to the said <HI>Lodge,</HI> in order to make due Enquiry into the Reputation and Capacity of the <HI>Candidate;</HI> unless by the Dispensation aforesaid.</P>
<P N="6">VI. But no Man can be enter'd a Brother in any particular <HI>Lodge,</HI> or admitted to be a Member there∣of, without the <HI>unonimous Consent of all the Members of that Lodge</HI> then present when the <HI>Candidate</HI> is pro∣pos'd, and their Coment is formally ask'd by the <HI>Ma∣ster;</HI> and they are to signify their <HI>Consent</HI> or <HI>Dissent</HI> in their own prudent way, either virtually or in form, but with Unanimity: Nor is this inherent Privilege subject to a Dispensation; because the <HI>Members</HI> of a particular <HI>Lodge</HI> are the best Judges of it; and if a fractious Member should be impos'd on them, it might spoil their Harmony, or hinder their Freedom; or even break and disperse the <HI>Lodge;</HI> which ought to be avoided by all good and true Brethren.</P>
<P N="7">VII. Every <HI>new Brother</HI> at his making is decently to cloath the <HI>Lodge,</HI> that is, all the Brethren present, and to deposite something for the Relief of indigent and decay'd Brethren, as the <HI>Candidate</HI> shall think fit to bestow, over and above the small Allowance sta∣ted by the <HI>By-Laws</HI> of that particular <HI>Lodge;</HI> which <HI>Charity</HI> shall be lodg'd with the <HI>Master</HI> or <HI>Wardens,</HI> or the <HI>Cashier,</HI> if the Members think fit to chuse one.</P>
<P>And the <HI>Candidate</HI> shall also solemnly promise to submit to the <HI>Constitutions,</HI> the <HI>Charges,</HI> and <HI>Regulati∣ons,</HI> and to such other good <HI>Usages</HI> as shall be intima∣ted to them in Time and Place convenient.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. No Set or Number of Brethren shall with∣draw or separate themselves from the <HI>Lodge</HI> in which
<PB N="62" REF="003744_0062_1002557C68332B10"/>they were made <HI>Brethren,</HI> or were afterwards admitted <HI>Members,</HI> unless the <HI>Lodge</HI> becomes too numerous; nor even then, without a Dispensation from the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> or his <HI>Deputy:</HI> And when they are thus separa∣ted, they must either immediately join themselves to such other Lodge as they shall like best, with the un∣animous Consent of that other Lodge to which they go <HI>(as above regulated)</HI> or else they must obtain the Grand-Master's Warrant to join in sorming a new Lodge.</P>
<P>If any Set or Number of Masons shall take upon themselves to form a Lodge without the <HI>Grand-Master's</HI> Warrant, the <HI>regular Lodges</HI> are not to coun∣tenance them, nor own them as <HI>fair Brethren</HI> and du∣ly form'd, nor approve of their Acts and Deeds; but must treat them as <HI>Rebels,</HI> until they humble them∣selves, as the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> shall in his Prudence di∣rect, and until he approve of them by his <HI>Warrant,</HI> which must be signify'd to the <HI>other Lodges,</HI> as the Custom is when a <HI>new Lodge</HI> is to be register'd in the <HI>List</HI> of <HI>Lodges.</HI></P>
<P N="9">IX. But if any Brother so far misbehave himself as to render his <HI>Lodge</HI> uneasy, he shall be twice duly ad∣monish'd by the <HI>Master</HI> or <HI>Wardens</HI> in a <HI>form'd Lodge;</HI> and if he will not refrain his Imprudence, and obedi∣ently submit to the Advice of the Brethren, and re∣form what gives them Offence, he shall be dealt with according to the <HI>By-Laws</HI> of that particular <HI>Lodge,</HI> or else in such a manner as the <HI>Quarterly Communication</HI> shall in their great Prudence think fit; for which a <HI>new Regulation</HI> may be afterwards made.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="63" REF="003744_0063_1002557DED5A61D0"/>
X. The <HI>Majority</HI> of every particular <HI>Lodge,</HI> when congregated, shall have the Privilege of giving <HI>Instructi∣ons</HI> to their <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Wardens,</HI> before the assembling of the <HI>Grand Chapter,</HI> or <HI>Lodge</HI> at the three <HI>Quarterly Communications</HI> hereafter mention'd, and of the <HI>Annual Grand Lodge</HI> too; because their <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Wardens</HI> are their Representatives, and are supposed to speak their Mind.</P>
<P N="11">XI. All <HI>particular Lodges</HI> are to observe the same <HI>Usages</HI> as much as possible; in order to which, and for cultivating a good Understanding among <HI>Free-Masons,</HI> some Members out of <HI>every Lodge</HI> shall be de∣puted to visit the <HI>other Lodges</HI> as often as shall be thought convenient.</P>
<P N="12">XII. <HI>The GRAND-Lodge</HI> consists of, and is form'd by the <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Wardens</HI> of all the regular particu∣lar <HI>Lodges</HI> upon Record, with the GRAND-MA∣STER at their Head, and his <HI>Deputy</HI> on his Left-hand, and the <HI>Grand-Wardens</HI> in their proper Places; and must have a QUARTERLY COMMUNICA∣TION about <HI>Michaelmas, Christmas,</HI> and <HI>Lady-Day,</HI> in some convenient Place, as the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> shall appoint, where no Brother shall, be present, who is not at that time a Member thereof, without a Dis∣pensation; and while he stays, he shall not be al∣low'd to vote, nor even give his Opinion, without Leave of the <HI>Grand-Lodge</HI> ask'd and given, or unless it be duly ask'd by the said Lodge.</P>
<P>All Matters are to be determin'd in the <HI>Grand-Lodge</HI> by a Majority of Votes, each Member having one Vote, and the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> having two Votes, un∣less
<PB N="64" REF="003744_0064_1002558096103950"/>the said <HI>Lodge</HI> leave any particular thing to the Determination of the <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> for the sake of Expedition.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. At the said <HI>Quarterly Communication,</HI> all Matters that concern the <HI>Fraternity</HI> in general, or particular <HI>Lodges,</HI> or single Brethren, are quietly, se∣dately, and maturely to be discours'd of and transact∣ed: <HI>Apprentices</HI> must be admitted <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Fellow-Craft</HI> only here, unless by a Dispensation. Here al∣so all Differences, that cannot be made up and ac∣commodated privately, nor by a particular <HI>Lodge,</HI> are to be seriously considered and decided: And if any <HI>Brother</HI> thinks himself aggrieved by the Decision of this Board, he may appeal to the <HI>annual Grand-Lodge</HI> next ensuing, and leave his Appeal in Writing, with the <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> or his <HI>Deputy,</HI> or the <HI>Grand-War∣dens.</HI></P>
<P>Here also the <HI>Master</HI> or the <HI>Wardens</HI> of each parti∣cular Lodge shall bring and produce a List of such Members as have been made, or even admitted in their particular <HI>Lodges</HI> since the last <HI>Communication</HI> of the <HI>Grand-Lodge:</HI> And there shall be a Book kept by the <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> or his <HI>Deputy,</HI> or rather by some Brother whom the <HI>Grand-Lodge</HI> shall appoint for SE∣CRETARY, wherein shall be recorded all the <HI>Lodges,</HI> with their usual Times and Places of forming, and the Names of all the Members of each <HI>Lodge;</HI> and all the Affairs of the <HI>Grand-Lodge</HI> that are proper to be written.</P>
<P>They shall also consider of the most prudent and effectual Methods of collecting and disposing of what
<PB N="65" REF="003744_0065_10025583090641C8"/>Money shall be given to, or lodged with them in <HI>Charity,</HI> towards the Relief only of any true Brother fallen into Poverty or Decay, but of none else: But every particular <HI>Lodge</HI> shall dispose of their own <HI>Cha∣rity</HI> for poor Brethren, according to their own <HI>By-Laws,</HI> until ir be agreed by all the <HI>Lodges (in a new Regulation)</HI> to carry in the <HI>Charity</HI> collected by them to the GRAND-LODGE, at the <HI>Quarterly</HI> or <HI>Annual Communication,</HI> in order to make a common Stock of it, for the more handsome Relief of <HI>poor Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>They shall also appoint a <HI>Treasurer,</HI> a Brother of good worldly Substance, who shall be a Member of the <HI>Grand-Lodge</HI> by virtue of his Office, and shall be always present, and have Power to move to the <HI>Grand-Lodge</HI> any thing, especially what concerns his Office. To him shall be committed all Money rais'd for <HI>Charity,</HI> or for any other Use of the <HI>Grand-Lodge,</HI> which he shall write down in a Book, with the re∣spective Ends and Uses for which the several Sums are intended; and shall expend or disburse the same by such a <HI>certain Order</HI> sign'd, as the <HI>Grand-Lodge</HI> shall af∣terwards agree to in a <HI>new Regulation:</HI> But he shall not vote in chusing a <HI>Grand-Master</HI> or <HI>Wardens,</HI> though in every other Transaction. As in like manner the <HI>Secretary</HI> shall be a Member of the <HI>Grand-Lodge</HI> by virtue of his Office, and vote in every thing except in chusing a <HI>Grand-Master</HI> or <HI>Wardens.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Treasurer</HI> and <HI>Secretary</HI> shall have each a <HI>Clerk,</HI> who must be a Brother and <HI>Fellow-Craft,</HI> but never must be a Member of the <HI>Grand-Lodge,</HI> nor speak without being allow'd or desir'd.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="003744_0066_100255849281EA40"/>
The <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> or his <HI>Deputy,</HI> shall always com∣mand the <HI>Treasurer</HI> and <HI>Secretary,</HI> with their <HI>Clerks</HI> and <HI>Books,</HI> in order to see how Matters go on, and to know what is expedient to be done upon any emer∣gent Occasion.</P>
<P>Another Brother (who must be a <HI>Fellow-Craft</HI>) should be appointed to look after the Door of the <HI>Grand-Lodge;</HI> but shall be no Member of it.</P>
<P>But these Offices may be farther explain'd by a <HI>new Regulation,</HI> when the Necessity and Expediency of them may more appear than at present to the <HI>Fra∣ternity.</HI></P>
<P N="14">XIV. If at any GRAND-LODGE, stated or oc∣casional, quarterly or annual, the <HI>GRAND-MASTER</HI> and his <HI>Deputy</HI> should be both absent, then the pre∣sent <HI>Master</HI> of a <HI>Lodge,</HI> that has been the longest a <HI>Free-Mason,</HI> shall take the Chair, and preside as <HI>Grand-Master pro tempore;</HI> and shall be vested with all his Power and Honour for the time; provided there is no Brother present that has been <HI>Grand-Master</HI> former∣ly, or <HI>Deputy Grand-Master;</HI> for the last <HI>Grand-Master</HI> present, or else the last <HI>Deputy</HI> present, should always of right take place in the Absence of the present <HI>Grand-Master</HI> and his <HI>Deputy.</HI></P>
<P N="15">XV. In the GRAND-LODGE none can act as <HI>Wardens</HI> but the <HI>Grand-Wardens</HI> themselves, if present; and if absent, the <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> or the Person who presides in his Place, shall order <HI>private Wardens</HI> to act as <HI>Grand-Wardens pro tempore,</HI> whose Places are to be supply'd by two <HI>Fellow-Craft</HI> of the same <HI>Lodge,</HI> call'd forth to act, or sent thither by the particular
<PB N="67" REF="003744_0067_10025588089E1DA0"/>Master thereof; or if by him omitted, then they shall be call'd by the <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> that so the <HI>Grand-Lodge</HI> may be always compleat.</P>
<P N="16">XVI. The GRAND-WARDENS, or any others, are first to advise with the <HI>Deputy</HI> about the Affairs of the <HI>Lodge</HI> or of the Brethren, and not to apply to the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> without the Knowledge of the <HI>De∣puty,</HI> unless he refuse his Concurrence in any certain necessary Affair; in which Case, or in case of any Difference between the <HI>Deputy,</HI> an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he <HI>Grand-War∣dens,</HI> or other Brethren, both Parties are to go by Concert to the <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> who can easily decide the Controversy and make up the Difference by virtue of his great Authority.</P>
<P>The <HI>Grand-Master</HI> should receive no Intimation of Business concerning <HI>Masonry,</HI> but from his <HI>Deputy</HI> first, except in such certain Cases as his Worship can well judge of; for if the Application to the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> be irregular, he can easily order the <HI>Grand-Wardens,</HI> or any other Brethren thus applying, to wait upon his <HI>Deputy,</HI> who is to prepare the Business speedily, and to lay it orderly before his <HI>Worship.</HI></P>
<P N="17">XVII. No <HI>GRAND-MASTER, Deputy</HI> Grand-Ma∣ster, <HI>Grand-Wardens, Treasurer, Secretary,</HI> or whoever acts for them, or in their stead <HI>pro tempore,</HI> can at the same time be the <HI>Master</HI> or <HI>Warden</HI> of a particular <HI>Lodge;</HI> but as soon as any of them has honourably discharg'd his <HI>Grand Office,</HI> he returns to that Post or Station in his particular <HI>Lodge,</HI> from which he was call'd to officiate above.</P>
<P N="18"><PB N="68" REF="003744_0068_10025589F03199C8"/>
XVIII. If the DEPUTY GRAND-MASTER be sick, or necessarily absent, the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> may chuse any <HI>Fellow-Craft</HI> he pleases to be his <HI>Deputy pro tem∣pore:</HI> But he that is chosen <HI>Deputy</HI> at the <HI>Grand-Lodge,</HI> and the <HI>Grand-Wardens</HI> too, cannot be dis∣charg'd without the Cause fairly appear to the <HI>Majo∣rity</HI> of the <HI>Grand-Lodge;</HI> and the <HI>GRAND-MAS∣TER,</HI> if he is uneasy, may call a GRAND-LODGE on purpose to lay the Cause before them, and to have their Advice and Concurrence: In which case, the <HI>Majority</HI> of the <HI>Grand-Lodge,</HI> if they cannot reconcile the <HI>MASTER</HI> and his <HI>Deputy</HI> or his <HI>Wardens,</HI> are to concur in allowing the <HI>MASTER</HI> to discharge his said <HI>Deputy</HI> or his said <HI>Wardens,</HI> and to chuse another <HI>De∣puty</HI> immediately; and the said <HI>Grand-Lodge</HI> shall chuse other <HI>Wardens</HI> in that Case, that Harmony and Peace may be preserv'd.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. If the <HI>GRAND-MASTER</HI> should abuse his Power, and render himself unworthy of the Obedience and Subjection of the <HI>Lodges,</HI> he shall be treated in a way and manner to be agreed upon in a <HI>new Regulati∣on;</HI> because hitherto the ancient <HI>Fraternity</HI> have had no occasion for it, their former GRAND-MASTERS having all behaved themselves worthy of that honou∣rable Office.</P>
<P N="20">XX. The <HI>GRAND-MASTER,</HI> with his <HI>Deputy</HI> and <HI>Wardens,</HI> shall (at least once) go round and visit all the <HI>Lodges</HI> about Town during his <HI>Mastership.</HI></P>
<P N="21">XXI. If the <HI>GRAND-MASTER</HI> die during his <HI>Mastership,</HI> or by Sickness, or by being beyond Sea, or any other way should be render'd uncapable of
<PB N="69" REF="003744_0069_1002558C841760E8"/>discharging his Office, the DEPUTY, or in his Ab∣sence, the <HI>Senior</HI> GRAND-WARDEN, or in his Absence the <HI>Junior,</HI> or in his Absence any three present <HI>Masters</HI> of <HI>Lodges,</HI> shall join to congregate the GRAND-LODGE immediately, to advise together upon that Emergency, and to send two of their Number to invite the <HI>last</HI> GRAND-MASTER to resume his Office, which now in course reverts to him; or if he refuse, then the <HI>next last,</HI> and so back∣ward: But if no former <HI>Grand-Master</HI> can be found, then the <HI>Deputy</HI> shall act as <HI>Principal,</HI> until another is chosen; or if there be no <HI>Deputy,</HI> then the old∣est <HI>Master.</HI></P>
<P N="22">XXII. The <HI>BRETHREN</HI> of all the <HI>Lodges</HI> in and about <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Westminster,</HI> shall meet at an ANNUAL COMMUNICATION and <HI>Feast,</HI> in some convenient Place, on <HI>St.</HI> JOHN <HI>Baptist</HI>'s Day, or else on <HI>St.</HI> JOHN <HI>Evangelist</HI>'s Day, as the <HI>Grand-Lodge</HI> shall think fit by a <HI>new Regulation,</HI> having of late Years met on <HI>St. John Baptist</HI>'s Day: Provided,</P>
<P>The <HI>Majority</HI> of the <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Wardens,</HI> with the <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> his <HI>Deputy</HI> and <HI>Wardens,</HI> agree at their <HI>Quarterly Communication,</HI> three Months before, that there shall be a <HI>Feast,</HI> and a <HI>General Communication</HI> of all the Brethren: For if either the <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> or the <HI>Majority</HI> of the particular <HI>Masters,</HI> are against it, it must be dropt for that Time.</P>
<P>But whether there shall be a <HI>Feast</HI> for all the <HI>Bre∣thren,</HI> or not, yet the <HI>GRAND-LODGE</HI> must meet in some convenient Place <HI>annually</HI> on <HI>St.</HI> JOHN's Day; or if it be <HI>Sunday,</HI> then on the next Day, in order to
<PB N="70" REF="003744_0070_1002558EF2C905B8"/>chuse every Year a <HI>new</HI> GRAND-MASTER, <HI>Deputy,</HI> and <HI>Wardens.</HI></P>
<P N="23">XXIII. If it be thought expedient, and the GRAND-MASTER, with the <HI>Majority</HI> of the <HI>Ma∣sters</HI> and <HI>Wardens,</HI> agree to hold a GRAND FEAST, according to the ancient laudable Custom of <HI>Masons,</HI> then the <HI>GRAND-WARDENS</HI> shall have the Care of preparing the <HI>Tickets,</HI> seal'd with the <HI>Grand-Master's</HI> Seal, of disposing of the Tickets, of receiving the Money for the Tickets, of baying the Materials on the <HI>Feast,</HI> of finding out a proper and convenient Place to feast in; and of every other Thing that concerns the Entertainment.</P>
<P>But that the Work may not be too burthensome to the two <HI>Grand-Wardens,</HI> and that all Matters may be expeditiously and safely managed, the <HI>Grand-Mas∣ter,</HI> or his <HI>Deputy,</HI> shall have Power to nominate and appoint a certain Number of Stewards, as his Wor∣ship shall think fit, to act in Concert with the two Grand-Wardens; all Things relating to the Feast be∣ing decided amongst them by a Majority of Voices; except the Grand-Master or his Deputy interpose by a particular Direction of Appointment.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. The Wardens and Stewards shall, in due time, wait upon the <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> or his Deputy, for Directions and Orders about the Premisses; but if his <HI>Worship</HI> and his Deputy are sick, or necessarily absent, they shall call together the Masters and Wardens of Lodgea to meet on purpose for their Advice and Or∣ders; or else they may take the Matter wholly upon themselves, and do the best they can.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="003744_0071_1002559077975A90"/>
The Grand-Wardens and the Stewards are to ac∣count for all the Money they receive, or expend, to the <HI>Grand-Lodge,</HI> after Dinner, or when the Grand-Lodge shall think fit to receive their Accounts.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> pleases, he may in due time summon all the Masters and Wardens of Lodges to consult with them about ordering the Grand-Feast, and about any Emergency or accidental Thing rela∣ting thereunto, that may require Advice; or else to take it upon himself altogether.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. The Masters of Lodges shall each appoint one experienc'd and discreet Fellow-Crast of his Lodge, to compose a <HI>Committee,</HI> consisting of one from every Lodge, who shall meet to receive, in a convenient A pactment, every Person that brings a Ticket, and shall have Power to discourse him, if they think fit, in orde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to admit him, or debar him, as they shall see cause: <HI>Provided</HI> they send no Man away before they have acquainted all the Brethren within Doors with the Reasons thereof, to avoid Mistakes; that so no true B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>other may be debarr'd, nor a false Brother or meer Pretender, admitted. This <HI>Committee</HI> must meet very early on St. <HI>John's Day,</HI> at the Place, even be∣fore any Persons come with Tickets.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. The <HI>Grand-Master</HI> shall appoint two or more trusty Brethren to be Porters, or Door-keepers, who are also to be early at the Place for some good Reasons; and who a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> to be at the Command of the Committee.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. The Grand-Wardens, or the Stewards, shall appoint before-hand such a Number of Brethren to
<PB N="72" REF="003744_0072_1002559365EA7778"/>serve at Table as they think fit and proper for that Work; and they may advise with the Masters and Wardens of Lodges about the most proper Persons, if they please, or may take in such by their Recom∣mendation; for none are to serve that Day; but <HI>free</HI> and <HI>accepted Masons,</HI> that the Communication may be free and harmonious.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. All the Members of the <HI>Grand-Lodge</HI> must be at the Place long before Dinner, with the <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> or his <HI>Deputy</HI> at their Head, who shall retire, and form themselves. And this is done in or∣der,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To receive any <HI>Appeals</HI> duly lodg'd, as above regulated, that the <HI>Appellant</HI> may be heard, and the Affair may be amicably decided before Dinner, if possible; but if it cannot, it must be delay'd till af∣ter the <HI>new Grand-Master</HI> is elected; and if it cannot be decided after Dinner, it may be delay'd, and re∣ferr'd to a <HI>particular Committee,</HI> that shall quietly ad∣just it, and make Report to the next <HI>Quarterly Com∣munication,</HI> that Brotherly-Love may be preserv'd.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To prevent any Difference or Disgust which may be fear'd to arise that Day; that no Interruption may be given to the Harmony and Pleasure of the GRAND FEAST.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To consult about whatever concerns the Decen∣cy and Decorum of the <HI>Grand-Assembly,</HI> and to pre∣vent all Indecency and ill Manners, the Assembly being promiscuous.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. To receive and consider of any good Motion or any momentous and important Affair, that shall
<PB N="73" REF="003744_0073_1002559602BA0368"/>be brought from the particular <HI>Lodges,</HI> by their Re∣presentatives, the several <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Wardens.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="29">XXIX. After these things are discuss'd, the <HI>GRAND-MASTER</HI> and his <HI>Deputy,</HI> the <HI>Grand-Wardens,</HI> or the <HI>Stewards,</HI> the <HI>Secretary,</HI> the <HI>Treasurer,</HI> the <HI>Clerks,</HI> and every other Person, shall withdraw, and leave the <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Wardens</HI> of the particular <HI>Lodges</HI> alone, in order to consult amicably about electing a NEW GRAND-MASTER, or continuing the <HI>present,</HI> if they have not done it the Day before; and if they are unanimous for continuing the <HI>present</HI> Grand-Ma∣ster, his <HI>Worship</HI> shall be call'd in, and humbly de∣sir'd to do the <HI>Fraternity</HI> the Honour of ruling them for the Year ensuing: And after Dinner it will be known whether he accepts of it or not; For it should not be discover'd but by the Election it self.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. Then the Masters and Wardens, and all the Brethren, may converse promiscuously, or as they please to sort together, until the Dinner is coming in, when every Brother takes his Seat at Table.</P>
<P N="31">XXXI. Some time after Dinner the GRAND-LODGE is form'd, not in Retirement, but in the Presence of all the Brethren, who yet are not Mem∣bers of it, and must not therefore speak until they are desired and allow'd.</P>
<P N="32">XXXII. If the GRAND-MASTER of last Year has consented with the <HI>Masters</HI> and <HI>Wardens</HI> in private, before Dinner, to continue for the Year ensuing; then one of the Grand-Lodge, deputed for that purpose, <HI>shall represent to all the Brethren his</HI> Worship's <HI>good Go∣vernment, &amp;c.</HI> And turning to him, shall, in the name
<PB N="74" REF="003744_0074_100255986F474D50"/>of the <HI>Grand Lodge,</HI> humbly request him to do the FRATERNITY <HI>the great Honour</HI> (if nobly born, if not, <HI>the great Kindness</HI>) of continuing to be their <HI>Grand Master</HI> for the Year ensuing. And his <HI>Worship</HI> decla∣ring his Consent by a Bow or a Speech, as he pleases, the said deputed Member of the Grand-Lodge shall proclaim him GRAND-MASTER, and all the Mem∣bers of the Lodge shall salute him in due Form. And all the Brethren shall for a few Minutes have leave to declare their Satisfaction, Pleasure and Congratulation.</P>
<P N="33">XXXIII. But if either the Master and Wardens have not in private, this Day before Dinner, nor the Day before, desir'd the last Grand-Master to continue in the Mastership another Year; or if he, when de∣sir'd, has not consented: Then, The last Grand-Master shall nominate his Successor for the Year ensuing, who if unanimously approv'd by the Grand-Lodge, and if there present, shall be proclaim'd, saluted, and congratulated the <HI>New Grand Master</HI> as above hinted, and immediately install'd by the last Grand-Master, according to Usage.</P>
<P N="34">XXXIV. But if that Nomination is not unani∣mously approv'd, the new Grand-Master shall be cho∣sen immediately by <HI>Ballot,</HI> every Master and Warden writing his Man's Name, and the last Grand-Master writing his Man's Name too; and the Man, whose Name the last Grand Master shall first take out, casu∣ally or by chance, shall be GRAND-MASTER for the Year ensuing; and if present, he shall be proclai∣med, saluted, and congratulated, as above hinted, and

<P N="35">XXXV. The last Grand-Master thus continued, or the new Grand-Master thus install'd, shall next nomi∣nate and appoint his <HI>Deputy</HI> Grand-Master, either the last or a new one, who shall be also declar'd, saluted and congratulated, as above hinted.</P>
<P>The <HI>GRAND-MASTER</HI> shall also nominate the <HI>new GRAND-WARDENS,</HI> and if unanimously ap∣prov'd by the <HI>Grand-Lodge,</HI> shall be declar'd, saluted, and congratulated as above hinted; but if not, they shall be chosen by <HI>Ballot,</HI> in the same way as the <HI>Grand-Master:</HI> As the <HI>Wardens</HI> of private <HI>Lodges</HI> are also to be chosen by <HI>Ballot</HI> in each <HI>Lodge,</HI> if the Members thereof do not agree to their <HI>Master</HI>'s Nomination.</P>
<P N="36">XXXVI.

<P N="37">XXXVII. Then the <HI>GRAND-MASTER</HI> shall al∣low any <HI>Brother, Fellow-Craft,</HI> or <HI>Apprentice</HI> to speak,
<PB N="76" REF="003744_0076_1002559AE2162E58"/>directing his Discourse to his <HI>Worship;</HI> or to make any Motion for the good of the Fraternity, which shall be either immediately consider'd and finish'd, or else referr'd to the Consideration of the <HI>GRAND-LODGE</HI> at their next <HI>Communication,</HI> stated or occasional. When that is over,</P>
<P N="38">XXXVIII. The GRAND-MASTER or his <HI>De∣puty,</HI> or some Brother appointed by him, shall ha∣rangue all the Brethren, and give them good Advice: And lastly, after some other Transactions, that can∣not be written in any Language, the Brethren may go away or stay longer, as they please.</P>
<P N="39">XXXIX. Every <HI>Annual</HI> GRAND-LODGE has an inherent Power and Authority to make <HI>new Regulati∣ons,</HI> or to alter these, for the real Benefit of this <HI>an∣cient Fraternity:</HI> Provided always that <HI>the old</HI> LAND∣MARKS <HI>be carefully preserv'd,</HI> and that such Alter∣ations and <HI>new Regulations</HI> be proposed and agreed to at the third <HI>Quarterly Communication</HI> preceding the <HI>Annual Grand Feast;</HI> and that they be offered also to the Perusal of all the Brethren before Dinner, in wri∣ting, even of the youngest <HI>Apprentice;</HI> the Appro∣bation and Consent of the <HI>Majority</HI> of all the Brethren present being absolutely necessary to make the same binding and obligatory; which must, after Dinner, and after the <HI>new GRAND-MASTER</HI> is install'd, be solemnly desir'd; as it was desir'd and obtain'd for these REGULATIONS, when propos'd by the GRAND-LODGE, to about 150 Brethren, on <HI>St, John Baptist's Day,</HI> 1721.</P>

<HEAD>POSTSCRIPT.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Here follows the Manner of constituting a <HI>NEW LODGE,</HI> as practis'd by his <HI>Grace</HI> the DUKE of WHARTON, the present <HI>Right Worshipful</HI> GRAND-MASTER, according to the ancient Usages of <HI>MASONS.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A <HI>NEW LODGE,</HI> for avoiding many irregularities, should be solemnly constituted by the <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> with his <HI>Deputy</HI> and <HI>Wardens;</HI> or in the <HI>Grand-Master</HI>'s Absence, the <HI>Deputy</HI> shall act for his <HI>Worship,</HI> and shall chuse some <HI>Master</HI> of a <HI>Lodge</HI> to assist him; or in case the <HI>Deputy</HI> is absent, the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> shall call forth some <HI>Master</HI> of a <HI>Lodge</HI> to act as <HI>Deputy pro tempore.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Candidates,</HI> or the new Master and Wardens, being yet among the <HI>Fellow-Craft,</HI> the GRAND-MASTER shall ask his <HI>Deputy</HI> if he has examin'd them, and finds the Candidate <HI>Master</HI> well skill'd in the <HI>noble Science</HI> and the <HI>royal Art,</HI> and duly instructed in our <HI>Mysteries, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And the <HI>Deputy</HI> answering in the affirmative, he shall (by the <HI>Grand-Master's</HI> Order) take the <HI>Candidate</HI> from among his Fellows, and present him to the <HI>Grand-Master;</HI> saying, <HI>Right worshipful</HI> Grand-Master, <HI>the Brethren here desire to be form'd into a</HI> new Lodge; <HI>and I present this my worthy</HI> Brother <HI>to be their</HI> Master, <HI>whom I know to be of good Morals and great Skill, true
<PB N="78" REF="003744_0078_100255A1832E50D8"/>and trusty, and a Lover of the whole</HI> Fraternity, <HI>where∣soever dispers'd over the Face of the</HI> Earth.</P>
<P>Then the GRAND-MASTER, placing the <HI>Candi∣date</HI> on his lest Hand, having ask'd and obtain'd the unanimous Consent of all the Brethren, shail say, <HI>I constitute and form these good Brethren into a</HI> new Lodge, <HI>and appoint you the</HI> Master <HI>of it, not doubting of your Capacity and Care to preserve the</HI> Cement <HI>of the Lodge,</HI> &amp;c. with some other Expressions that are proper and usual on that Occasion, but not proper to be written.</P>
<P>Upon this the <HI>Deputy</HI> shall rehearse the <HI>Charges</HI> of a <HI>Master,</HI> and the <HI>GRAND-MASTER</HI> shall ask the <HI>Can∣didate,</HI> saying, <HI>Do you submit to these</HI> Charges <HI>as</HI> Masters <HI>have done in all Ages?</HI> And the Candidate signifying his cordial Submission thereunto, the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> shall, by certain significant Ceremonies and ancient Usages, install him, and present him with the <HI>Consti∣tutions,</HI> the <HI>Lodge-Book,</HI> and the <HI>Instruments</HI> of his Of∣fice, not all together, but one after another; and after each of them, the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> or his <HI>Deputy,</HI> shall rehearse the short and pithy <HI>Charge</HI> that is suitable to the Thing presented.</P>
<P>After this, the Members of this <HI>new Lodge,</HI> bowing all together to the <HI>Grand-Master,</HI> shall return his <HI>Wor∣ship</HI> Thanks, and immediately do their <HI>Homage</HI> to their <HI>new Master,</HI> and signify their Promise of Subjection and Obedience to him by the usual <HI>Congratulation.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Deputy</HI> and the <HI>Grand-Wardens,</HI> and any other Brethren present, that are not Members of this new Lodge, shall next congratulate the <HI>new Master;</HI> and
<PB N="79" REF="003744_0079_100255A307F32FD0"/>he shall return his becoming Acknowledgements to the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> first, and to the rest in their Order.</P>
<P>Then the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> desires the new Master to enter immediately upon the Exercise of his Office, in chusing his <HI>Wardens:</HI> And the <HI>new Master,</HI> calling forth two <HI>Fellow-Craft,</HI> presents them to the <HI>Grand-Master</HI> for his Approbation, and to the <HI>new Lodge</HI> for their Consent. And that being granted,</P>
<P>The senior or junior <HI>Grand-Warden,</HI> or some other Brother for him, shall rehearse the <HI>Charges</HI> of <HI>Wardens;</HI> and the <HI>Candidates</HI> being solemnly ask'd by the <HI>new Master,</HI> shall signify their Submission thereunto.</P>
<P>Upon which the <HI>new Master,</HI> presenting them with the <HI>Instruments</HI> of their Office, shall in due Form, in∣stall them in their proper Places; and the Brethren of that <HI>new Lodge</HI> shall signify their Obedience to the <HI>new Wardens</HI> by the usual <HI>Congratulation.</HI></P>
<P>And this LODGE being thus compleatly con∣stituted, shall be register'd in the <HI>Grand-Master</HI>'s Book, and by his Order notified to the <HI>other Lodges.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPROBATION.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS by the Confusions occasioned in the Saxon, Danish, and Norman Wars, the <HI>Records</HI> of Masons have been much vitiated, the Free-Masons of Eng∣land twice thought it necessary to correct their <HI>Constitutions, Charges,</HI> and <HI>Regulations;</HI> first in the Reign of king Athel∣stan the Saxon, and long after in the Reign of King Ed∣ward IV. the Norman: And whereas the old <HI>Constitutions</HI> in England have been much interpolated, mangled, and miserably corrupted, not only with false Spelling, but even with many false Facts and gross Errors in History and Chronology, through Length of Time, and the Ignorance of Transcribers, in the dark illiterate Ages, before the Revival of Geometry and ancient Architecture, to the great Offence of all the learned and judicious Brethren, whereby also the Ignorant have been deceiv'd.</P>
<P>And our late worthy Grand-Master, his Grace the Duke of MONTAGU, having order'd the Author to peruse, cor∣rect, and digest into a new and better Method, the Histo∣ry, Charges, and Regulations of the ancient Fraternity; He has accordingly examin'd several Copies from Italy and Scotland, and sundry Parts of England, and from thence, (tho' in many things erroneous) and from several other an∣cient Records of Masons, he has drawn forth the above-written <HI>new Constitutions,</HI> with the Charges and General Regulations. And the Author having submitted the whole to the Perusal and Corrections of the late and present De∣puty Grand-Masters, and of other learned Brethren; and also of the Masters and Wardens of particular Lodges at their Quarterly Communication; he did regularly deliver them to the late Grand-Master himself, the said DUKE of MONTAGU<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> for his Examination, Correction, and Ap∣probation; and his Grace, by the Advice of several Bre∣thren, order'd the same to be handsomely printed for the
<PB N="81" REF="003744_0081_100255A955D52838"/>use of the Lodges, tho' they were not quite ready for the Press during his Mastership.</P>
<P>THEREFORE We, the present <HI>Graud-Master</HI> of the Right Worshipful and most ancient Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons, the Deputy Grand-Master, the Grand-Wardens, the Masters and Wardens of parti∣cular Lodges (with the Consent of the Brethren and Fel∣lows in and about the Cities of London and West minster) having also perused this Performance, Do join our lauda∣ble Predecessors in our solemn <HI>Approbation</HI> thereof, as what We believe will fully answer the End proposed; all the valuable Things of the old Records being retain'd, the Errors in History and Chronology corrected, the false Facts and the improper Words omitted, and the whole digested in a new and better Method.</P>
<P>And we ordain that these be received in every particu∣lar Lodge under our Cognizance, as the <HI>ONLY CONSTI∣TUTIONS</HI> of Free and Accepted Masons amongst us, to be read at the making of new Brethren, or when the Ma∣ster shall think fit; and which the new Brethren should pe∣ruse before they are made.</P>

The</HI> Company <HI>of</HI> Masons, <HI>being otherwise termed</HI> Free Masons, <HI>of an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ent Staunding and cood Reckoning, by means of affable and kind Meetings diverse Tym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, and as a</HI> loving Brotherhood <HI>should use to doe, did frequent this</HI> mutual Assembly <HI>in the Tym<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of King</HI> Henry V. <HI>the 12th Year of his most gracious Reign</HI> And the said Record descri∣bing a <HI>Cont of Arms,</HI> much the same with <HI>That</HI> of the <HI>LONDON COMPANY</HI> of <HI>Free∣men</HI> Masons, it is generally believ'd that the said <HI>Company</HI> is descended of the ancient <HI>Fraternity;</HI> and that in former Times no Man was made free of that <HI>Company</HI> until he was install'd in some <HI>Lodge</HI> of <HI>Free</HI> and <HI>Accepted Masons,</HI> as a necessary Qualification. But that laudable Practiss seems to have been long in Dissuetude. The Brethren in foreign Parts have also dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>over'd that several noble and ancient <HI>Societies</HI> and <HI>Orders</HI> of Men have derived their <HI>Charges</HI> and <HI>Regulations</HI> from the <HI>Free-Masons,</HI> (which are now the most ancient <HI>Order</HI> upon Earth) and perhaps were originally all Members too of the said ancient and worshipful <HI>Fraternity.</HI> But this will more fully appear in due Time.</P>
