<HEAD>To the READER.</HEAD>
<P><HI>THE following</HI> Discourse <HI>pretends to no more than to give a few</HI> Hints <HI>on the</HI> serious Truths <HI>therein propounded to the Consideration both of</HI> Magistrates <HI>and</HI> People <HI>on the</HI> present Occasion. <HI>It is left to the</HI> Judicious Reader <HI>to clothe the</HI> Ske∣leton <HI>with flesh and skin, and to give it a proper</HI> Complexion <HI>in his own more Enlar∣ged Meditation. But if it may be of any Use to</HI> teach Transgressors GOD's ways <HI>and to minister unto their</HI> Conversion; <HI>or if it may so far be Accounted of as a</HI> Concio ad Magistratum, <HI>as to put</HI> MAGISTRATES <HI>in mind of their Duty, to propound more than ever with an</HI> Actual Intention <HI>the Glory of GOD and the</HI> Good of Souls <HI>in their Ad∣ministring Justice; and indeed excite Them to get some happy</HI> Experience of their own
<PB REF="001804_0004_0FB84424C5AE0678"/>Conversion <HI>to GOD; it will then answer a very</HI> noble End <HI>and have a most</HI> happy Effect.</P>
<P>Magistrates <HI>and</HI> Ministers <HI>can do nothing more Laudable than to</HI> Unite <HI>their pious Endeavours, with Zeal and Prudence, to serve the Interests of</HI> Piety and Vertue <HI>a∣mong their People. And it is the least Ex∣pression of</HI> Loyalty <HI>to GOD and to the</HI> King, <HI>readily and heartily to Obey the Commands we have from the</HI> Throne <HI>to do so. Let us return our</HI> Dutiful Prayers <HI>for the</HI> Life <HI>of the KING and of his SON; that like the</HI> Reign <HI>of</HI> Solomon <HI>so His present MA∣JESTY</HI>'s <HI>may bear some</HI> Image <HI>of the</HI> Holiness <HI>and</HI> Happiness <HI>of the</HI> Kingdom <HI>of CHRIST:</HI> that the Mountains may bring peace to the People, and the little Hills by Righteousness: that in His days the righteous may flourish, <HI>and a Founda∣tion be laid for</HI> abundance of peace so long as the Moon endureth.</P>

<HEAD>A SERMON For the <HI>Reformation of Manners,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Psalm LI. 13.</HI></BIBL>
<P><HI>Then</HI> will I teach Transgressors thy Ways, and Sinners shall be Converted unto Thee.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN these Words <HI>David</HI> speaks not only as became a <HI>Penitent</HI> and a Convert, a <HI>Pro∣phet</HI> and a Preacher, but also as became his <HI>Royal Dignity</HI> and State, the <HI>King of Israel.</HI> Not only is it the part of the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> but it belongs also to the <HI>Prince</HI> and the <HI>Civil Ruler,</HI> to endeavour the <HI>Reclaiming</HI> of <HI>Trans∣gressors,</HI> and the <HI>Conversion</HI> of their People from Sin unto GOD.</P>
<P>IT being therefore <HI>Recommended</HI> to me to day by the <HI>Honourable</HI> the GOVERNMENT over us, to <HI>read</HI> publicly unto You the ROYAL PROCLAMATION Emitted by our <HI>Sove∣raign
<PB N="2" REF="001804_0006_0FB844294C1DF978"/>Lord</HI> the KING, for the Encouragment of Vertue and Piety, and for the preventing and punishing of Vice Prophaness and Immo∣rality, and to <HI>Enforce</HI> the same with a <HI>sutable Exhortation</HI> to you; I have chosen <HI>these Words</HI> of the Royal Prophet, King <HI>DAVID,</HI> to usher in the most pious <HI>Resolution</HI> and <HI>Decla∣ration</HI> of our <HI>Protestant King;</HI> in which like <HI>David</HI> He would <HI>teach Transgressors GOD</HI>'s <HI>ways, and would have Sinners converted unto Him.</HI></P>
<P>YOU are therefore preach'd to rather from the <HI>Throne</HI> to day than from the <HI>Pulpit:</HI> But indeed from the <HI>Throne</HI> of GOD (by whom Kings reign, and by whose Laws they are to govern) from his <HI>High</HI> Throne you are al∣ways <HI>taught.</HI></P>
<P>IN these <HI>Words</HI> of Holy <HI>David</HI> you may <HI>Observe,</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>A gracious Purpose and holy Resolution: I will teach Transgressors thy Ways.</HI> It is no ways below a <HI>Prince</HI> to do this; but it is the special Duty and Office of a <HI>Prophet</HI> always to be do∣ing it. Who would not hearken to, learn of and obey such a <HI>Teacher? Where the Word of a King is there is Power.</HI> He speaks from GOD, a Greater KING, <HI>whose Name is dreadful.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001804_0007_0FB8442BA9BD5938"/>
BUT <HI>whom</HI> would the <HI>King of Israel</HI> teach? the <HI>Sinner</HI> and the <HI>Transgressor?</HI> the <HI>Profane</HI> and <HI>Impious?</HI> Yes: for the <HI>King</HI> is also the <HI>Law∣giver</HI> and the <HI>Judge.</HI></P>
<P>AND <HI>what</HI> would He teach them? <HI>GOD</HI>'s <HI>ways.</HI> The Ways of Religion and Holiness: GOD's Laws and Commandments: the way of Life and of Salvation.</P>
<P>TRULY a most <HI>pious and Princely</HI> Care for the Good and Welfare of his People, and a most <HI>devout</HI> and worthy Regard to the Will and Honour of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>TRANSGRESSORS</HI> might fear the <HI>Wrath</HI> of such a Religious King, and look to be pu∣nished with Severity; but He would first have them <HI>Instructed</HI> carefully and <HI>taught their Duty,</HI> and then if they still go on to transgress he would see the <HI>Laws</HI> in force against them du∣ly <HI>Executed.</HI> This was <HI>David's Purpose and Re∣solution.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>OBSERVE the End which He proposes,</HI> and the good <HI>Effect which He promises to Him∣self,</HI> in teaching Transgressors GOD's ways: And that is <HI>their Conversion unto GOD.</HI> The most <HI>kind,</HI> the most <HI>noble</HI> and <HI>generous</HI> Inten∣tion that one could possibly have. And a most <HI>natural</HI> Effect of Divine teaching. For why are we taught GOD's ways, but to <HI>turn our feet into His Testimonies?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001804_0008_0FB8442CEBCA05A0"/>
HAPPY the <HI>People</HI> whose Prince labours their Conversion from Sin into the Holy ways of Religion and true Godliness. Such a Prince is indeed the <HI>Father</HI> of his People, and in <HI>GOD's stead.</HI> He rules <HI>for</HI> GOD and <HI>in his Fear.</HI></P>
<P>BUT as the <HI>Conversion</HI> of Transgressors from their evil ways, was <HI>David's</HI> aim and desire, so he <HI>persuades himself of Success,</HI> and ex∣presses a humble <HI>Confidence</HI> thro' Grace that it would be so: <HI>Sinners shall be converted unto Thee.</HI></P>
<P>MAN <HI>proposes</HI> well very often, but GOD only knows the <HI>Event.</HI> Especially is it thus in <HI>persuading</HI> men, whose <HI>hearts are only in God's hand.</HI> How often are we ready to promise our selves great Success, but how vain are our Expectations for the most part! Howe∣ver, it is nobly proposed, and GOD is to be Confided in that Sinners shall be converted while they are taught GOD's ways. <HI>For the Conversion of Sinners is the very End of Teaching.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. IN the <HI>Text</HI> we may observe <HI>Something referr'd to and supposed,</HI> on the <HI>Supposition</HI> where∣of it is that <HI>David</HI> forms his present holy Re∣solution and Expectation: <HI>Then</HI> will I teach—says He. <HI>When</HI> should it be? what doth this <HI>Then</HI> refer to?</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="001804_0009_0FB8442EAC8F4D88"/>
IF you look into the <HI>Psalm</HI> you find it to be the <HI>most Eminent of his Penitentials.</HI> He had been himself a <HI>Great Transgressor</HI> in the matter of <HI>Uriah:</HI> this he confesses and bewails and implores the forgivness of and to be cleansed from the pollution of: He was now a happy <HI>Penitent</HI> and <HI>pardoned,</HI> but not ready to con∣clude so of himself <HI>suddenly:</HI> He begs there∣fore in the <HI>Verses</HI> before my <HI>Text</HI> that GOD would <HI>clear up</HI> to him the <HI>Truth</HI> of his own Repentance and pardoned state, his own <HI>Re∣novation</HI> and GOD's <HI>Reconciliation,</HI> and so <HI>re∣store</HI> unto him the <HI>Joy of his Salvation,</HI> and <HI>then</HI> (says he) <HI>will I teach Transgressors thy ways, and Sinners shall be Converted unto thee.</HI></P>
<P><HI>PENITENTS</HI> have been some of the best <HI>Teachers.</HI> They can speak <HI>feelingly,</HI> by a sad and by a happy <HI>Experience.</HI> In <HI>Gratitude</HI> to God who has forgiven them they will teach others, and who will teach with more <HI>pathos,</HI> pertinence, tenderness and power? <HI>This</HI> is the Teaching which we might trust will <HI>convert Transgressors.</HI></P>
<P>Here then we learn these <HI>three Truths.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>I. <HI>Transgressors must be taught GOD's ways.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>II. <HI>In teaching them GOD's ways we must pro∣pose and aim at their Conversion to Him.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="6" REF="001804_0010_0FB84431D9536218"/>
III. <HI>We had need get some happy Experience of our own Conversion, and GOD's free Forgivness of our own Sins, in order to our teaching others the ways of GOD, with any hope of being Instrumental to convert them.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>I do not propose any <HI>full Discourse</HI> on either of these great and copious Truths, but only a <HI>general Reflection</HI> or two on one and other of them.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>TRANSGRESSORS must be taught GOD's ways.</HI> But who are <HI>Transgressors?</HI> and what are <HI>GOD's ways?</HI> and who <HI>must teach</HI> them? and <HI>why</HI> must they needs be taught? and <HI>how</HI> must it be done? <GAP DESC="blank" EXTENT="1 word" DISP=" _____ "/> Very briefly.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WHO are Transgressors?</HI> A general and full <HI>Answer</HI> to this the Apostle <HI>John</HI> gives us 1 Joh. 3.4. <HI>Whosoever committeth Sin transgres∣seth the Law, for Sin is the Transgression of the Law.</HI> So that whoever lives in any sinful way, in any known and allowed course of Disobe∣dience to the Will and Word of GOD, he is a Transgressor. We are called <HI>Transgressors from the womb,</HI> and that most truly, being born in Sin and by Nature under the Power and Rule of it. Every Act of sin, and any <HI>one Act</HI> of it, makes a Man a Transgressor in the sight of <HI>GOD</HI> and of his own <HI>Conscience.</HI> The best man that lives is a hainous Transgressor in the
<PB N="7" REF="001804_0011_0FB84435F0B40C50"/>impartial Judgment of his own Heart: for <HI>in many things we offend all, and he that offends in one point is guilty of all.</HI> Job 13.23. <HI>How many are my Iniquities? make me to know my Trans∣gression and my Sin.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to be sure the <HI>Text</HI> means at least <HI>Impenitent and Unconverted</HI> Sinners; and it may be more especially the <HI>openly Irreligious, leud and profane.</HI> In this gross sense our <HI>Saviour</HI> was numbred with <HI>Transgressors.</HI> And for such the <HI>Law is made; for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and pro∣phane.</HI> 1 Tim. 1.9. <HI>i.e.</HI> to <HI>restrain</HI> from such Ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, by revealing the wrath of GOD from Heaven a gainst it; or to <HI>doom</HI> them unto Everlasting Destruction in case of final Impenitence therein.</P>
<P>LET us then understand here by <HI>Transgres∣sors</HI> all Impenitent and ungodly Sinners, both <HI>secret</HI> and <HI>open:</HI> the <HI>last</HI> are Transgressors in the sight of men, the <HI>first</HI> before GOD.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>WHAT are GOD's ways?</HI> which must be taught to Transgressors, and which they need to learn. I answer</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> GOD's ways are the holy <HI>Precepts, Rules and Directions of his written Word,</HI> his re∣vealed Will; wherein the Indispensible <HI>Duty</HI> of sinful Man is laid down, what he must <HI>be</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="001804_0012_0FB84437A98CC3B8"/>and <HI>do</HI> to be saved. In these are contained the whole <HI>Way</HI> of Holiness, the way of life, the way to Heaven Luk. 10.25, 26. Or</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> GOD's ways may here in parti∣cular mean <HI>the Manner of his dealing with Souls in bringing them to Repentance, and graciously pardoning them upon their Repentance;</HI> together with the <HI>Necessity of instant Repentance,</HI> and the <HI>dreadfulness of His Wrath in case of final Impeni∣tence.</HI> The penitent and pardoned <HI>David</HI> had well learn'd these <HI>Holy Lessons,</HI> and was well able to Instruct Transgressors both in the way of GOD's <HI>convincing a Soul of Sin, renewing him to Repentance, and sealing to him his pardon.</HI> He wou'd now teach to Sinners <HI>their way unto GOD</HI> by Repentance, and <HI>GOD's ways of Mer∣cy and Grace</HI> toward them that repent. Psal. 66.16. <HI>Come all you—and I will declare what GOD hath done for my Soul: I cried unto him with my Mouth</HI> (say, under the pains of Guilt) <HI>and he was extolled with my Tongue,</HI> (under the Joyful sense of his pardoning Mercy.)</P>
<P>TRANSGRESSORS need to be taught these things, that they may "neither <HI>fear∣lesly persist</HI> in their ungodly Courses, nor un∣der the Conviction of the Evil of them <HI>despair</HI> of finding Mercy. Transgressors must be taught how <HI>evil and bitter</HI> a thing it is to transgress GOD's Laws; and how CHRIST
<PB N="9" REF="001804_0013_0FB84438E4543390"/><HI>hath finished Transgression, and made an End of Sin, and made Reconciliation for Iniquity.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>WHO must teach</HI> Transgressors GOD's Ways? <HI>I will,</HI> said <HI>David.</HI> Let us <HI>every one</HI> answer like him for our <HI>selves,</HI> and say—<HI>So will I,</HI> and <HI>so will I.</HI> We all <HI>may</HI> do it, and <HI>ought</HI> to do it, each one in his <HI>own place.</HI> Every man in his own <HI>line</HI> is his <HI>Brothers Keeper,</HI> Mo∣nitor and Teacher. But more particularly,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> IT is the Immediate Office of the <HI>Ministers of Religion</HI> to teach Transgressors GOD's ways. <HI>They</HI> are Called and Separated unto this very Work. GOD has ordained that there be an <HI>Order</HI> of men Devoted to <HI>Instruct</HI> others in his Will, to <HI>admonish</HI> them not to dare to offend against it, to <HI>require</HI> them to Observe it, to declare his <HI>Wrath</HI> against the Disobedient, and his <HI>Mercy</HI> to them that obey him. Necessity is therefore laid upon <HI>Us,</HI> and wo unto us if we preach not the Gospel; which is a <HI>Doctrine</HI> of Repentance and the Re∣mission of Sin, as CHRIST Himself <HI>came to call Sinners to Repentance.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly, Magistrates</HI> are also ordained of GOD to be His <HI>Ministers in the Gates,</HI> there to teach Transgressors his ways. So <HI>Moses, Joshua,</HI> and the <HI>Judges of Israel, Samuel, David</HI> and <HI>Solomon; Asa, Jehoshaphat</HI> and <HI>Hezekiah; Josiah, Nehemiah,</HI> &amp;c. taught their People the
<PB N="10" REF="001804_0014_0FB8443A752773D0"/>way of the LORD. And the same is Incum∣bent on the <HI>Christian Magistrate,</HI> even to re∣quire of their <HI>Subjects</HI> Obedience to the Divine Laws, and to punish the open Contempt and Violation of them. The <HI>Legislature</HI> teach GOD's ways in the <HI>Good Laws they Enact</HI> for the promoting his Worship and true Religion, Morality and Vertue among their People, and for the punishing of Irreligion and Pro∣phaness, vice and wickedness. And while They do <HI>this</HI> and rule according to <HI>Godliness,</HI> it is as much <HI>Irreligion</HI> and as sure <HI>Damnation</HI> to disobey Them, as it is not to comply with the <HI>Word</HI> which we preach. And this seems the real <HI>Scope</HI> of what the <HI>Apostle</HI> teaches us in that <HI>famous place,</HI> Rom. 13.1,—5. <HI>Let every Soul be subject to the Higher Powers. For there is no Power but of GOD: The Powers that be are ordained of GOD. Whosoever therefore resisteth the Power, resisteth the Ordinance of GOD; and they that resist shall receive to themselves Damnation. For Rulers are not a Terror to good Works but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the Power? do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same: For he is the Minister of GOD to thee for Good. But if thou do that which is evil be afraid; for he beareth not the Sword in vain: for he is the Minister of GOD, a Revenger to</HI> execute <HI>wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye
<PB N="11" REF="001804_0015_0FB8443BEF211040"/>must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for Conscience sake.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> I might go on and say, <HI>Christians must teach every one his Nei'bour, and every one his Brother,</HI> saying, <HI>Know the LORD, and let us walk in his ways.</HI> You are a <HI>People of Religion,</HI> and are to watch over one another in love, as <HI>Brethren in Christ:</HI> You must love your Bro∣ther <HI>in your heart,</HI> and not <HI>suffer Sin upon him,</HI> but must <HI>in any wise rebuke</HI> thy Nei'bour. We must be <HI>Exhorting one another daily while it is called to day, lest any be hardned thro' the Deceit∣fulness of Sin.</HI> 1 Thes. 5.14. <HI>Now we exhort you Brethren, warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble-minded, support the weak,</HI>—and <HI>ever follow that what is good both among your selves and toward all men.</HI></P>
<P>IN particular, <HI>Relatives</HI> should teach one another GOD's ways: Parents their Children, Husbands their Wives, Masters their Servants; every One his Houshold as <HI>Abraham</HI> and <HI>Da∣vid</HI> did theirs, <HI>to keep the way of the LORD.</HI></P>
<P>THUS we may be all of us <HI>Teachers</HI> to one another, being our selves taught of GOD <HI>naturally to care</HI> for each others Souls. And if any one be a <HI>Transgressor</HI> and he come in our way, let us wisely tell him the <HI>Evil of his way</HI> and the <HI>Misery</HI> therein; the <HI>Excellency</HI> of GOD's ways, and the <HI>Necessity</HI> of his Conversion into them. But</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="12" REF="001804_0016_0FB84442ABF090D0"/>
4. <HI>WHY must Transgressors needs be taught?</HI> The <HI>Reasons</HI> are too <HI>many</HI> to give them all, and too <HI>obvious</HI> to need almost to name them. For is not the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD written, and the <HI>Preaching</HI> thereof ordained, for this very End? The Law is <HI>nigh</HI> thee, even in thy hand and heart and mouth; and is to <HI>dwell richly in us, teaching and admonishing one another;</HI> being <HI>pro∣fitable for Doctrine, for reproof, for Correction and Instruction in Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, The <HI>Relations</HI> wherein GOD has set us one toward another cannot be otherwise answered, or the <HI>Duties</HI> of them discharg'd according to his Will and unto his Glory. He has made us of <HI>one Blood,</HI> made us together his <HI>Covenant People,</HI> set us in our <HI>Offi∣ces</HI> and in a Christian <HI>Brotherbood,</HI> told us how we must carry it one to another and <HI>fulfil the Law of love, please</HI> and honour him, <HI>do good</HI> and be Blessings in the World, and be <HI>blessed</HI> our selves for Evermore.</P>
<P>TRANSGRESSORS are so <HI>hard to learn, dull of hearing</HI> and <HI>slow of heart, to believe,</HI> that therefore they should the rather be taught. And <HI>Compassion to their Immortal Souls</HI> should be instead of a thousand Arguments with us, to be <HI>at any pains</HI> to teach them. How do we <HI>hate 'em in our hearts</HI> if we suffer them to perish in the ways of Sin? It were more <HI>Inhumane</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="001804_0017_0FB84444EEA19770"/>and barbarous than to let a <HI>blind man</HI> go over a Precipice, and not tell him his danger or set him in his way: or to see a <HI>Mad-man</HI> stab∣bing himself and not hold his hand.</P>
<P>Finally, The <HI>good Order of the World,</HI> the peace and welfare of Mankind, require that Transgressors be taught GOD's ways. The <HI>Foundations</HI> of the World are else <HI>out of course,</HI> and the Earth and all its Inhabitants must <HI>dis∣solve.</HI> This <HI>bears up the Pillars of it,—I said unto the Fools deal not foolishly, and to the wicked lift not up the born.</HI></P>
<P>THERE wou'd be <HI>no living</HI> here on Earth, if it were not for the <HI>Instruction</HI> and <HI>Govern∣ment</HI> which GOD has set up among men. Our Sabbaths and the Preaching of GOD's Word are an <HI>unknown Good</HI> to a wicked World tho' so few are converted; and so is the <HI>Re∣straint</HI> that lies on Mankind for fear of the <HI>Sword of the Magistrate</HI> and the <HI>lash of humane Laws.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the last and chief <HI>Reason</HI> why Trans∣gressors must be taught GOD's ways is their <HI>Conversion and Salvation:</HI> of which hereafter.</P>
<P N="5">5. And lastly, <HI>HOW must we teach them?</HI> I answer</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>AUTHORITATIVLY.</HI> For it is in GOD's cause, and in his stead, and we may be bold, as an Inferior Officer may command in the
<PB N="14" REF="001804_0018_0FB84446AFD83EC8"/>King's Name. <HI>Magistrates</HI> may not fear a <HI>Mul∣titude,</HI> nor <HI>Ministers</HI> the <HI>Faces</HI> of any. Our Lord taught <HI>as one having Authority,</HI> and he has vested his Ministers in his own Authori∣ty: Tit. 2.15. <HI>These things speak and exhort, and rebuke with all Authority, let no man despise thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>THE Great and powerful Motives of Reli∣gion must be taught together with the Doctrines and Rules of it:</HI> the <HI>Penalty</HI> with the <HI>Precept,</HI> the Promises and Threatnings together with the Commandments. <HI>Life and Death, the Bles∣sing and the Curse</HI> must be set before men, to∣gether with the Statutes and Judgments. So <HI>Mo∣ses denounced unto Israel</HI> that they should surely <HI>perish quickly</HI> in case of Disobedience and Im∣penitence: and so said the <HI>Apostle, Knowing the Terrors of the LORD we persuade men.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. WE must teach Transgressors with <HI>Meek∣ness and Love, Affection and Entreaty. What will ye,</HI> saith the <HI>Apostle</HI> to the <HI>Corinthians, shall I come unto you with a Rod? or in love and in the Spirit of Meekness?</HI> He had <HI>Authority</HI> to do the one, in case of Contumacy; and <HI>Goodness</HI> eno' to chuse the <HI>other</HI> in case there were any hopes of prevailing on them by kindness and Gentleness. Read the Character of the LORD's <HI>Servant,</HI> 2 Tim. 2.24. <HI>The Servant of the LORD must not strive, but be gentle to all
<PB N="15" REF="001804_0019_0FB84447E2F04A48"/>men, apt to teach, patient, in meekness Instructing them that oppose themselves, if GOD peradventure will give them Repentance.</HI> And accordingly the <HI>Apostles</HI> of our <HI>Lord</HI> JESUS have left us this <HI>Example: I beseech you by the meekness and Gentleness of CHRIST: As tho' GOD did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ's stead: Wherefore tho' I might be much bold in Christ to Injoyn thee that which is Convenient, yet for Love-sake 1 ra∣ther Entreat thee.</HI> So Gentle is the <HI>Gospel</HI> to∣ward Sinners and Saints, amidst all its Autho∣rity and Terrors.</P>
<P N="4">4. TRANSGRESSORS must be taught with <HI>all Long-suffering:</HI> patience as well as leni∣ty. 2 Tim. 4.2. God bears long with the perversness and Obstinacy of men, and still waits on them to be gracious. Num. 14.11. <HI>How long will this People provoke me? how long shall it be e'er ye believe me?</HI> We continue there∣fore in our Work, from Sabbath to Sabbath, and Year after Year, <HI>in Season and out of Sea∣son, and line must be upon line, and precept upon a precept, here a little and there a little:</HI> It may be they will yet hearken and receive Instru∣ction! <HI>When shall it once be?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. And lastly, IF Transgressors will not learn GOD's ways, but <HI>openly defy</HI> and violate his Commandments, <HI>They must then be taught as Gideon taught the men of Succoth, with the
<PB N="16" REF="001804_0020_0FB8444AD89D21D8"/>briars and thorns of the Wilderness.</HI> I mean, That open Transgressors fall under public <HI>Church-Censures,</HI> and under the <HI>lash of the Civil Law;</HI> both which are ordained by GOD for the opening mens Ears to <HI>Discipline,</HI> and to com∣mand them to return from Iniquity. So the censur'd <HI>Corinthian</HI> was humbled and restored: and so <HI>Hymeneus</HI> was delivered to Satan that he <HI>learn</HI> not to blaspheme. And so has the LORD commanded, <HI>Them that Sin rebuke be∣fore all, that others may fear.</HI> And for the same Reason is the Civil Magistrate <HI>the Minister of GOD,</HI> and the Penalties of the Civil Law are GOD's <HI>Ordinance,—that all Israel may hear and fear and do no more so wickedly.</HI></P>
<P>AND thus have I briefly said, <HI>who are Trans∣gressors?</HI> and what are <HI>GOD's ways?</HI> and <HI>who</HI> must teach them? and <HI>why</HI> they must needs be taught? and <HI>how</HI> it must be done?</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>two last</HI> of these <HI>Enquiries</HI> may re∣ceive a farther <HI>Answer</HI> in the next <HI>Observa∣tion.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>IN teaching Transgressors GOD's way we must propose and aim at their CONVERSION unto GOD.</HI> This is the <HI>End of Divine Teaching:</HI> to turn men from darkness to light, and from the power of Sin and Satan unto GOD. The <HI>Ministry of the Word</HI> serves unto this glorious <HI>End,</HI> and this we must propose in all other
<PB N="17" REF="001804_0021_0FB8444BA1B5B708"/><HI>Occasional Instructions</HI> unto any. This is instead of a thousand <HI>Reasons</HI> why we should <HI>teach,</HI> and why sinners should hear and <HI>learn:</HI> And this gives us a <HI>Rule</HI> and <HI>Direction</HI> how to teach, namely, so as may <HI>best tend to the Conversion</HI> of men from the ways of Sin. How <HI>seriously</HI> therefore, and with what <HI>Earnestness</HI> and <HI>Im∣portunity, Affectionatness and Solemnity,</HI> should we teach you GOD's <HI>Ways?</HI></P>
<P>INDEED our <HI>Solemn Assemblies</HI> were a ridi∣culous <HI>Pageantry</HI> if it were not that the Con∣version of Sinners is the thing propounded in them. And for want of this Actual Intention it is that the Worship of so many is a <HI>Mockery.</HI> Moreover, The <HI>Severity</HI> of a Godly and strict <HI>Discipline</HI> in the Church, and those of <HI>Humane Laws</HI> in the punishment of Transgressors a∣gainst the State, were a <HI>vain thing</HI> if it were not to reclaim men from their evil ways, and reform them.</P>
<P>WHETHER therefore it be that we teach Sinners from the <HI>Pulpit,</HI> or whether it be the <HI>Lawgiver</HI> who does it, or the <HI>Judge;</HI> or whe∣ther it be that Christians <HI>privatly instruct</HI> and admonish them that transgress against GOD; both one and other ought to propose and act for this <HI>one End, to Convert a Sinner from the Error of his way, and to save a Soul from death,</HI> And this very thing should make Instructions
<PB N="18" REF="001804_0022_0FB844520A5101A8"/>and Reproofs <HI>welcome</HI> unto Sinners, whereon in public or in private: <HI>Let the righteous smite me it shall be a kindness, let him reprove me it shall be an excellent Oil,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>I wish truly that Teachers and Reprovers of every sort, as well as those that are Admo∣nished and corrected by them, wou'd propose and act for this one End, <HI>the spiritual and Ever∣lasting Good of Souls.</HI> It is to be own'd that <HI>Ministers</HI> themselves are too often <HI>Defective</HI> in this Actual Intention, tho' it be the very End of their Ministry. And more is it to be Ap∣prehended, that the Generality of those who come to <HI>hear</HI> have not at all their own Con∣version and Salvation at heart. <HI>The Law of the LORD is perfect, converting the Soul; i. e.</HI> per∣fectly fitted to this End: yet how rarely is it effectual upon the Souls of Sinners? Truly <HI>Brethren,</HI> the fault lies either on <HI>Us</HI> who preach, or on <HI>You</HI> that <HI>hear,</HI> or on <HI>both</HI> toge∣ther. Either <HI>we</HI> don't eno' propose and act for your Conversion to GOD, or You <HI>your</HI> selves don't do it.</P>
<P>BUT then, Is it <HI>our</HI> Care alone to minister to the Conversion of Souls? by no means. You that are <HI>Parents,</HI> when you teach your Children the way of the Lord, is it not to <HI>be∣get</HI> them again unto God? And let <HI>Children</HI> hearken to their Father that begat them and
<PB N="19" REF="001804_0023_0FB84454955E9C90"/>unto the Law of their Mother that bare them, that by the Blessing of GOD on their good Instructions and Charges they may betimes be <HI>born again.</HI> Take heed that all this pious and tender Care of your Parents for your Souls be not lost, and turn at last to your greater Condemnation, and <HI>you mourn at the last, How have I hated Instruction, and my heart despised reproof, and I have not obeyed the voice of my Teachers, nor inclined my Ear to them that instructed me.</HI></P>
<P>BUT then there is the other great <HI>Instance,</HI> wherein it is to be fear'd that least of all have the world of Mankind any Apprehension <HI>of any pious Intention for the Conversion of Sinners: soil.</HI> the <HI>legal Conviction</HI> and <HI>Judicial punishment</HI> of Transgressors, by the Civil Magistrate and Judge. Never the less it is certain that <HI>Christi∣anity</HI> obliges those in the Magistracy to pro∣pose even the Conversion of Criminals and Malefactors from their vile ways unto those of Vertue and true Godliness: And convicted Sinners ought to accept of their public Pun∣ishments and Shames as so meant: Which tho' it may seem <HI>strange Doctrine</HI> and a <HI>ridicu∣lous Expectation</HI> in a corrupt World, yet is in it self the most <HI>Just and Reasonable thing</HI> in the world; and renders Magistracy so much the more <HI>wirthy</HI> of the Ordination of a Holy
<PB N="20" REF="001804_0024_0FB8445565B050C0"/>GOD, and the <HI>Benefit</HI> of it so much the more Apparent in a <HI>Christian State.</HI> For if the Civil Powers are ordained of God not only for the present peace and good Order of the world, but also in some measure for the Eternal Wel∣fare of men; so much the more <HI>Venerable</HI> are they to a people of Religion. Nor is here any <HI>Clash∣ing of Orders;</HI> for as the <HI>Ministry of the Word</HI> tho' it directly serve to the bringing Souls to a better Life, yet abundantly serves to the peace and good Order of the World at the same time, so tho' the direct and Immediate End of Civil Government be the outward peace, tranquility and Felicity of the People, yet it has also really a further Aim, Influence and Effect, even in the Religion and spiritual Good of its Subjects.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>Humane Laws</HI> serve under the <HI>Di∣vine,</HI> and by <HI>That</HI> these are to be fram'd, and to <HI>It</HI> to be subordinated. So <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron</HI> are <HI>Brethren,</HI> and <HI>join</HI> in bringing the Israel of GOD on toward <HI>Canaan;</HI> tho' it is JESUS only that gives 'em <HI>Rest.</HI> And therefore the <HI>Subjection</HI> of the LORD's People must be <HI>Re∣ligious</HI> and <HI>Conscientious:</HI> for the <HI>Law</HI> of GOD is <HI>one and the same</HI> in the mouth of the LORD's <HI>Prophet,</HI> or His <HI>Judge:</HI> Do People then reve∣rence their <HI>Ministers</HI> and the <HI>Word of GOD,</HI> in their Mouth? and shall they not pay a higher
<PB N="21" REF="001804_0025_0FB84456E836A5B0"/>Reverence to their pious <HI>Rulers,</HI> &amp; to a <HI>Divine Sentence</HI> in the Mouth of their KING? 1 Tim. 2.1, 2, 3, 4. <HI>I exhort therefore that first of all Supplications, Prayers, Intercessions, and giving of Thanks be made for all men: for Kings and for all that are in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all Godliness and Honesty: For this is good and acceptable in the sight of GOD our Saviour; Who will have all men to be saved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI> 1 Pet. 2. 13, 14, 15. <HI>Submit your selves to every Ordinance of Man for the LORD's sake, whether it be to the King as supream, or unto Governours as unto them that are sent by Him, for the punishment of evil doers and for the praise of them that do well: For so is the Will of GOD that with well doing ye should put to Silence the Ignorance of foolishment.</HI></P>
<P>ONE more <HI>Observation</HI> lies before us from the Text, and a very <HI>Serious</HI> one it is, and with it I shall shut up my <HI>Discourse.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>THAT they whose Office it is to teach unto others GOD's ways, and who are to minister to the Conversion of Transgressors unto GOD, had need to get some comfortable Experience of their own Conversion, and of GOD's free Forgivness of their own Sins. Then</HI> will I teach Transgressors thy ways, says <HI>David</HI> in the <HI>Text;</HI> soil, <HI>When</HI> thou LORD hast renewed and forgiven me; <HI>when</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="001804_0026_0FB84459E11BC0F8"/>thou shalt graciously give to me the happy Sense of my Pardon and Cleansing.</P>
<P>TRULY my <HI>Brethren,</HI> how shall we take upon us to <HI>teach</HI> others, with any prospect of <HI>Success,</HI> if we are not our selves taught of GOD! with what face or decency can we expect that GOD should <HI>own</HI> us in this <HI>great Service,</HI> or Men regard us, if we our selves are the servants of Sin! Not but that GOD <HI>sometimes uses</HI> them that are wicked to do good unto the Souls of others. But what <HI>Comfort</HI> can there be in this? <HI>if after I have preached unto others I my self should be a Castaway,</HI> 1 Cor. 9.27. to be Instrumental to the bringing o∣thers to that Salvation, which we are never like to come unto our selves! how can one bear to think of it? Wherefore <HI>take heed to thy self, and unto thy Doctrine</HI> (as the <HI>Apostle</HI> writes to <HI>Timothy</HI>) that thou mayst both <HI>save thy self and them that hear thee.</HI> 1 Tim. 4.16.</P>
<P>IT can never be expected that we shall be <HI>hearty, earnest and vigilant</HI> in seeking the Con∣version of others, if we have never <HI>felt</HI> our own misery and perishing state without the saving and free Grace of GOD, nor had any <HI>Experience</HI> of the Work of Conversion in our own Souls. If we have not <HI>car'd</HI> for our own Souls, how shall we for the Souls of others! If we have never been apprehensive of our
<PB N="23" REF="001804_0027_0FB8445911EDE3B8"/>own <HI>Danger</HI> in an unconverted State, how shall we be zealous for another's <HI>Deliverance</HI> from wrath? Or how shall we speak aright of the <HI>Grace</HI> of GOD to others, if we know nothing of it <HI>experimentally</HI> our selves? How shall we <HI>Encourage</HI> others to go unto a SAVI∣OUR whom we have never <HI>sought</HI> unto for Mercy our selves? nor receiv'd any <HI>Mercy</HI> from? Yea, <HI>to the wicked GOD saith, What hast thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou shouldst take my Covenant into thy Mouth? seeing thou hatest Instruction and castest my words behind thee.</HI> Psal. 50.16, 17. And again, <HI>Thou there∣fore which teachest another, teachest thou not thy self?</HI> Rom. 2.21. Apply this to every <HI>sort</HI> of Teacher, for the <HI>Preacher of the Word</HI> is not the only Teacher whom the <HI>Reproach</HI> bears upon: It falls as hard on others. <HI>Parents,</HI> who command your Children to know and keep the way of the LORD, are you Irre∣ligious? <HI>Man</HI> that tellest thy Nei'bour of the <HI>Blemish</HI> in his Eye, hast thou a <HI>Beam</HI> in thy own? You that by <HI>Commission</HI> search out and punish Immoralities in others, are you vici∣ous, leud or unjust your selves? <HI>Sittest thou like Ananias to judge others according to Law, and breakest thou the Law thy self?</HI> Thus the <HI>Rule</HI> holds universally among <HI>Christians,</HI> and obliges in the <HI>Civil</HI> Order as well as in the
<PB N="24" REF="001804_0028_0FB8445F245C4DC8"/><HI>Sacred. Thou, when thou art Converted strengthen thy Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if we have <HI>found Grace and Mercy</HI> from GOD to turn to Him from our own Sins, then may we in our places with <HI>good Assurance</HI> and Confidence teach the way of GOD to others. For <HI>how can we but speak</HI> the things whereof we know the Certainty, Necessity and Excellency by a happy Experiance and deep Conviction in our own Souls? The things that have been <HI>freely given to us</HI> of GOD, and <HI>wro't in us</HI> by his <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> we shall be <HI>ready</HI> to declare unto others. We shall speak <HI>feelingly</HI> of them and so <HI>affectingly; out of the Abundance</HI> of our own hearts <HI>into the hearts</HI> of others.</P>
<P>HENCE <HI>Penitents</HI> have been ever some of the <HI>best Preachers</HI> to Sinners: So were <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Solomon, Peter</HI> and <HI>Paul;</HI> who had both felt the <HI>Guilt</HI> and <HI>bitterness</HI> of Sin, and known the <HI>Freeness</HI> and <HI>Riches</HI> of the Grace of GOD; and how to direct others in the way wherein the <HI>Spirit</HI> of GOD had led them, and to <HI>com∣fort</HI> them with the Comforts <HI>wherewith they themselves had been comforted of GOD.</HI> 1 Tim. 1.16. <HI>For this cause I obtained Mercy, that in me first Jesus Christ might shew forth all Long-suffering for a pattern to them that should hereafter believe on him to Life Everlasting.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="001804_0029_0FB8446137C373A0"/>
LET us then <HI>make sure</HI> first of our own Conversion to GOD, and then <HI>lay out</HI> our selves for the Conversion of others.</P>
