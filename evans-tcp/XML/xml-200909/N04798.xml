<HEAD>TO THE INGENIOUS AUTHOR OF THE POEM ENTITLED. <HI>Philosophic Solitude,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>WHILE in your verse with transport and surprize</L>
<L>We see the rural scene sublimely rise;</L>
<L>While country pleasures innocently gay</L>
<L>Smile in your song, and steal our souls away;</L>
<L>With joy the varied landskip we pursue,</L>
<L>And all <HI>Arcadia</HI> opens to our view.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>List'ning we hear the soft melodious strains,</L>
<L>O'er <HI>lofty mountains, and subjacent plains;</HI></L>
<L>While bending forests echoing back the sound,</L>
<L>And <HI>groves responfive</HI> send the music round:</L>
<L>Intranc'd we hang suspended on your tongue,</L>
<L>And every pulse beats concert to your song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="iv" REF="005986_0004_1027200642FE8A60"/>
<L>Wrapt into ages past, and future times,</L>
<L>To distant regions, and to happier climes;</L>
<L>When native innocence adorn'd mankind,</L>
<L>E'er fraud and lux'ry had debauch'd the mind,—</L>
<L>Ev'n in the golden age, (as poets feign)</L>
<L>When peace attended <HI>Saturn</HI>'s gentler reign,</L>
<L>In patriarchal bow'rs, our fancy roves</L>
<L>Thro' sylvan scenes, gay lawns, and shady groves;</L>
<L>Fir'd by your lays, we long to taste the sweets</L>
<L>That breathe in vernal groves, and green retreats.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While warm'd with gen'rous scorn and manly rage,</L>
<L>You form the taste of a degenerate age,</L>
<L>Nobly disdaining the renown'd resorts</L>
<L>Of pompous palaces, and glittering courts;</L>
<L>(The pride of fools!—) we feel th' inchanting strains,</L>
<L>And covet kingdoms, less than groves or plains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When to <HI>sequester'd scenes</HI> our view you guide,</L>
<L>And paint out <HI>nature in her virgin-pride,</HI></L>
<L>We see the <HI>mossy banks, and op'ning flowers,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Th' elysian fields, and amaranthin bowers;</HI></L>
<L>And list'ning hear the <HI>sleep-inspiring rills</HI></L>
<L>Flow in your verse, and murmur down the hills.</L>
<L>Still as we trace you thro' th' harmonious theme,</L>
<L>New beauties flourish, and fresh glories beam;</L>
<L><PB N="v" REF="005986_0005_1027200CA9E01F90"/>
Pleasures on pleasures, scenes on scenes arise,</L>
<L><HI>And varied prospects glad our wandring eyes.</HI></L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When wak'd by <HI>Phoebus,</HI> and the vocal choir,</L>
<L>To nature's God you tune the warbling lyre;</L>
<L>The sacred transport every power controuls,</L>
<L>And warm devotion swells our raptur'd souls:</L>
<L>Nor less we wonder while you range the mead,</L>
<L><HI>Converse with angels, and the mighty dead:</HI></L>
<L>Or from the learned throng selected choose</L>
<L>Or authors to instruct or to amuse;</L>
<L>With wisest art and judgment drawn, we trace</L>
<L>Each different genius,—each peculiar grace.</L>
<L>There <HI>Virgil, Milton, Pope</HI> and <HI>Dryden</HI> shine,</L>
<L>And gentlest <HI>Watts,</HI> harmonious and divine;</L>
<L><HI>Newton</HI> and <HI>Lock,</HI> and more of deathless name,</L>
<L>There live distinguish'd in the rolls of fame:</L>
<L>The <HI>Trojan</HI> hero, who with glory shines,</L>
<L>Drawn in the <HI>Mantuan</HI> and the <HI>Laureat</HI>'s lines,</L>
<L>Warm'd by your quick'ning touch to life returns,</L>
<L>Glitters in arms, and for the combat burns.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>When in your verse <HI>o'er heav'ns crystalline road,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Thunders the chariot of the Filial-God,</HI></L>
<L>We hear the rattling wheels and axils bound,</L>
<L>And all heav'n's pavement trembling with the sound:</L>
<L><PB N="vi" REF="005986_0006_1027200F649A0A78"/>
Then gentler strains the flowing notes prolong,</L>
<L>And <HI>Windsor-plains</HI> reflourish in your song.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when you celebrate the nuptial ties,</L>
<L>Connubial sweets, and matrimonial joys,</L>
<L>And paint the beauties of a vertuous wife,</L>
<L>To soothe the cares, and share the joys of life;</L>
<L>The radiant charms our am'rous passions move,</L>
<L>Subdue our breasts, and bend our souls to love.</L>
<L>We pant to prove what <HI>Hymen</HI>'s rites contain,</L>
<L>To taste the bliss, and rush into the chain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But why shou'd we on single features dwell,</L>
<L>Since all the parts of the fair piece excell?</L>
<L>Thro' out the whole with wonder and surprize,</L>
<L>We view dispers'd unnumber'd beauties rise!</L>
<L>Smooth, yet sublime, and regularly strong,</L>
<L>The shining incidents the theme prolong;</L>
<L>Ravish'd we gaze, in admiration lost,</L>
<L>And know not where to praise or wonder most.</L>
<L>YALENSIS smiles the finish'd piece to view,</L>
<L>And fondly glories in a son like YOU.</L>

<L><HI>Pope</HI>'s nervous phrase, and <HI>Homer</HI>'s sacred fire,</L>

<LG>
<L>When e'er you sing in tuneful rural strains</L>
<L>The shady forests, and the flow'ry plains,</L>
<L>A second <HI>Windsor</HI> starts in every line,</L>
<L>The plains and forests in full glory shine:</L>
<L>Fir'd with the song, thro' all the painted mead,</L>
<L>Well-pleas'd I wander where by numbers lead:</L>
<L>What varying scenes in every page appear!</L>
<L>What varying scenes my busy fancy chear!</L>
<L><PB N="viii" REF="005986_0008_10272013F90CCC20"/>
Rapt by your Notes, from maze to maze I rove,</L>
<L>And hear soft music eccho thro' the grove;</L>
<L>Now thoughtful wander thro' the waving wood;</L>
<L>Now hear the murmur of the falling flood;</L>
<L>Here branching trees crowd to a living shade,</L>
<L>There breathing Zephyrs fan the op'ning glade:</L>
<L>Where e'er I tread the purple flow'rs appear,</L>
<L>The rich profusion of the smiling year!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But when your lofty numbers reach the skies,</L>
<L>Th' excursive soul thro' every region flies;</L>
<L>Reads nature's volume with supreme delight,</L>
<L>And joyous roams the boundless fields of light.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To raise the genius, and exalt the thought,</L>
<L>What the learn'd sons of <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Albion</HI> wrote,</L>
<L>You travel o'er, — and taught by heav'n you sing</L>
<L>Each author's merit on the sounding string.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Or if the fair one's charms you wou'd rehearse,</L>
<L>How smooth the numbers, and how soft the verse!</L>
<L>My fancy forms her of Angelic-race,</L>
<L>And more than human sparkles in her face:</L>
<L>In her a thousand beauties we survey.</L>
<L>A thousand charms her lovely form display;</L>
<L>While virtue's beams serene around her shine,</L>
<L>Dart from her soul and speak her all divine.</L>

<L>Far from th' eternal hurries of the great,</L>
<L>The din of cities and the farce of state:</L>
<L>There let me pass the golden hours away,</L>
<L>While books and walks prolong the silent day.</L>
<L>Stranger to civil and religious strife,</L>
<L>There sail serene along the stream of life,</L>
<L>Dye unlamented, as I liv'd unknown:</L>
<L>Nor ask, to note my grave, the monumental stone.</L>

<L>While the thick town obscures my clouded eyes;</L>
<L>No blooming hills here rise in distant views,</L>
<L>No stream or op'ning glades invite the muse;</L>
<L>In one short space, subjected to my eye,</L>
<L>Chairs, carts, drays, coaches, dirty-pavements lie;</L>
<L>Here when I strive to tune the sounding lyre</L>
<L>The same dull prospect damps the rising fire:</L>
<L>Thrice happy bard! who in some lone abode</L>

<L>LET ardent heroes seek renown in arms,</L>
