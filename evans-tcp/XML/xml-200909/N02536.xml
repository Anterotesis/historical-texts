<HEAD>An <HI>Argument</HI> for AND <HI>Persuasive</HI> unto the great and important Duty OF <HI>FAMILY WORSHIP.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT having been no small part of the Honour and Glory of my <HI>Country,</HI> from the beginning of it, that it has been famous for the practice of FAMILY WORSHIP, to which under the Grace and Blessing of GOD the <HI>Virtue, Religion</HI> and <HI>Prosperity</HI> of it must be (if I judge right) very much attribut∣ed; I am therefore moved and inclined to look over the <HI>Arguments</HI> &amp; <HI>Motives</HI> unto, and the <HI>Reasons</HI> for this great and important <HI>Duty,</HI> and leave them (as they have occurr'd to me) with the Children of my People, that this GLORY <HI>may still dwell in our Land.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Method,</HI> in which I shall dispose my Tho'ts on this <HI>Argument,</HI> shall be this:
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. To say what I mean by FAMILY WORSHIP:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. To prove it to be a Duty, and show our <HI>Obligations</HI> to observe it.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. To
<PB N="2" REF="003008_0003_0FEF9C89024C3608"/>lay down <HI>Rules</HI> for the due Performance of it. And</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. To urge the Duty with some proper <HI>Motives.</HI></ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. By FAMILY WORSHIP I mean, That standing re∣ligious <HI>Order,</HI> and Usage in a <HI>Houshold,</HI> wherein the <HI>Head</HI> of the House doth ordinarily every Day, at stated and appointed Times, call the <HI>Family</HI> together for the performance of such <HI>holy Exercises,</HI> as are proper to them in their worshipping GOD together.</P>
<P>This is a distinct kind of Worship from <HI>solitary</HI> and <HI>secret,</HI> which is a Persons retiring by himself a∣lone (into his <HI>Closet,</HI> Matth. vi. 6.) to meditate, read, pray to and praise GOD. It is also a distinct thing from <HI>public</HI> Worship, in Church Assemblies and Congregations, for the Administration of Instituted Ordinances. So likewise it is diverse from the <HI>private Meetings</HI> of religious People at one anothers Houses, occasionally to pray together and hear the Word.</P>
<P>There are parts of <HI>Instituted</HI> Worship, that do by no means belong to Family Worship. GOD never meant the <HI>Sacraments of the New Testament</HI> to be ad∣ministred by Masters of Families in their houses. These belong to the public Ministry of Religion in the Churches of CHRIST. And excepting Cases of <HI>necessity,</HI> or in times of <HI>persecution,</HI> there can be no pretence for the Administration of <HI>Baptism</HI> or the <HI>Lords Supper,</HI> in private Houses. And then the Ad∣ministration should be by a <HI>Minister</HI> of CHRIST, and to more than a private houshold. Wherefore Sacra∣mental Administrations are no part of <HI>Family Worship.</HI> — Nor is there any Argument from the Sacraments of the <HI>Old Testament</HI> to those of the <HI>New. Circumci∣sion</HI> and the <HI>Passover</HI> were in their Institution a kind of Family Ordinances; but so were not the <HI>Baptism</HI> of CHRIST and his <HI>Supper.</HI></P>
<P>Only the Exercises and Duties of <HI>natural Worship</HI> are proper to Families, as such. Natural Worship is
<PB N="3" REF="003008_0004_0FEF9C8E8DD9A398"/>that which the Consideration of the Being and Per∣fections of GOD dictate to the Reason and Conscience of Man. <HI>This</HI> also belongs both to public and secret Worship.</P>
<P><HI>Prayer and Praise;</HI> Adoration and Thanksgiving; Confession, Supplications and Intercession; are pro∣per and necessary parts of Family Worship. So is <HI>reading the Word</HI> of GOD to our Housholds<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Deut. vi. 6, 7. 1 Tim. iv. 5.</NOTE>. Also the <HI>singing of Psalms</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ephes. v. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9. Col. iii. 10.</NOTE>: <HI>Catechising</HI> the Children; and a religious asking GODS Blessing on our daily <HI>Food,</HI> with hearty Thanksgiving for it<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Tim. iv. 4, 5.</NOTE>. These are the principal religious <HI>Exercises,</HI> that do properly belong to the Worship of GOD in our Houses.</P>
<P N="2">II. Now to shew our <HI>Obligation</HI> thus to worship GOD with our Housholds, I shall argue
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. from the light of <HI>Reason,</HI> and natural Conscience,</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. from <HI>Scripture</HI> Revelations.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">1. As to the light of <HI>Reason,</HI> and natural Consci∣ence, it is indeed very <HI>hard,</HI> for us who enjoy the <HI>Gospel</HI> to say, What the bare light of Nature and Reason, in this our <HI>fallen</HI> state would teach us. We are so <HI>alienated from the Life of God thro' the Ignorance that is in us, by reason of the Blindness of our hearts,</HI> that probably no one of us would have had a tho't of worshiping GOD with our Families, had we been born and bred <HI>Pagans</HI> and <HI>Salvages.</HI> But yet I am confident, that <HI>Reason</HI> duely exercised, and natural <HI>Conscience</HI> hearkned to thereupon, would soon lead and bring Men to worship GOD both in secret and with their Families. At least <HI>our</HI> Reason under the common Illuminations of <HI>Scripture,</HI> is fruitful of Ar∣guments for so plain a Duty.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="003008_0005_0FEF9C90505E8188"/>
The light of <HI>Nature</HI> teaches us that there is a GOD, and that he ought to be <HI>worship'd</HI> by us, and if sing∣ly and <HI>apart</HI> by our selves, why not <HI>socially</HI> and to∣gether? And if socially, why not in <HI>Families,</HI> which are distinct Societies? And why not <HI>firstly</HI> in Fami∣lies, which are the <HI>first</HI> Societies that Mankind came and comes into? For Families are the <HI>Original</HI> of all Societies, and consequently the first social Worship was of necessity in a Family. This is plain and easy Reasoning, level to the Capacity of every Child: But how strongly and irresistibly doth it conclude for the Worship of GOD in <HI>Families?</HI></P>
<P>To let in a gleam of <HI>Revelation</HI> here: Who but GOD is the <HI>Institutor</HI> and Founder of Families? He made at first but <HI>one Pair;</HI> He put them together and blessed them. He could have made <HI>many</HI> Fami∣lies at once, plac'd them together, and ordain'd the first Act of Worship to have been from an <HI>Assembly</HI> of men. But it pleased <HI>the</HI> GOD <HI>of the Spirits of all Flesh</HI> to make at first <HI>one</HI> only Family out of which all the Families of the Earth have sprang. And why did He this? seeing <HI>He had the residue of the Spirit,</HI> and could as easily have made a million Families at once? Why may I not be allow'd to say — <HI>That He might seek</HI> a godly Family, a religious Houshold! that this might be his <HI>First-fruits</HI> from the Earth, a∣mong men! that Families might be <HI>sanctified</HI> unto Him for ever, by the rendring of the <HI>first</HI> social Wor∣ship in them; and that this sacred <HI>Dignity</HI> might be put and entail'd upon Housholds, that for the first <HI>Ages</HI> of the World the <HI>whole</HI> Worship of GOD was in them. And should not his solemn Worship continue in them to the <HI>End</HI> of the World?</P>
<P>All the Nations of the Earth own that Families are <HI>distinct Societies,</HI> and that they have a <HI>Government</HI> of their own; Laws and Rules proper and peculiar to themselves, for their own weal and good Order.
<PB N="5" REF="003008_0006_0FEF9C93C7F46468"/>Witness the famous LAW of King <HI>Ahasuerus,</HI> directed <HI>to every People after their Language,</HI> both to <HI>great and small, That every Man shall bear Rule in his own House.</HI> Esther i. ult. Say then, shall he not rule for GOD? and acknowledge HIM in his House with constant dai∣ly Devotions? Shall these primary, necessary, uni∣versal, perpetual Societies of Men be without the Adoration, Confession and Praises of GOD in them? Has the great GOD nothing to do with these Societies, nor they with Him? No? tho' He be the Author, Preserver, Feeder and daily Benefactor of the Fami∣ly? the <HI>Health</HI> of it, and its GOD? Is not the Family what it is by his Providence? can it subsist a day without Him? And yet no Worship of GOD in it from day to day! no <HI>Prayer?</HI> as if it had no De∣pendance on Him! Does it indeed <HI>want</HI> no Benefit or Blessing from Him? nor <HI>expect</HI> any? that it craves none! And does it <HI>receive</HI> none from day to day? that there are no daily Offerings of <HI>Praise</HI> in the House! Or does GOD indeed keep and feed the Fa∣mily from year to year; and has He no <HI>Altar,</HI> no <HI>Sacrifices</HI> in it? but the doors of the House are shut against Him! He shut <HI>out</HI> of it! This profaness, this <HI>Atheism</HI> is implied in the want of Family Worship; in defiance to Reason and Conscience.</P>
<P>At the same time, Can a Society be more <HI>adapted</HI> and <HI>engaged</HI> to worship together daily, than a Family is? Is any other Society framed and <HI>formed</HI> like <HI>this</HI> for daily worship? living together under one <HI>Roof,</HI> and united in mutual and near <HI>Relations</HI> to each o∣ther! and tied together by those bonds of Love and Endearment, which should bind them to GOD, whose <HI>all Souls are,</HI> the Souls of Parents and Children, Masters and Servants! — O with what a sacred <HI>Pleasure</HI> should a Man call the Family of his Love together, to worship GOD? Can he own a GOD, and love his Fa∣mily, and not love to pray with them and for them?
<PB N="6" REF="003008_0007_0FEF9C99DC582A20"/>Doth not even <HI>Nature</HI> teach this? — Methinks he must be willingly ignorant, who questions it, <HI>not lik∣ing to retain</HI> GOD <HI>in his knowledge;</HI> his Disaffection to his MAKER (horrible to speak) overthrowing even his natural Affection to his <HI>Family!</HI></P>
<P>Again, Let Nature and Reason judge of the spe∣cial <HI>Need</HI> and <HI>Occasion</HI> of Worship in our Families. Are there no Family <HI>Mercies</HI> daily wanted, which GOD only can give? nor any received from Him e∣very Morning and Evening, for which Thanksgiv∣ing ought openly to be render'd? And are there not sometimes Family <HI>Sins,</HI> for which the Houshold have reason to <HI>humble</HI> themselves together before GOD? And are there not at times Family <HI>Afflictions,</HI> the Rod of GOD upon our House, which call the Hous∣hold to <HI>mourn</HI> together, under the mighty Hand of GOD? — Surely there is the <HI>same</HI> Reason why <HI>Fa∣milies</HI> should pray and give Thanks together, in the case of Family Mercies needed and received; as there is why <HI>single Persons</HI> should do so in the case of personal Needs and Receipts. And there is the <HI>like</HI> Reason for Family Humiliation and Supplication in case of Family Sins and Corrections, as why a Per∣son or People should humble themselves and pray un∣der personal and public Sins and Judgments.</P>
<P>I will close this <HI>Argument</HI> from the light of Reason, by remembring You of the <HI>Houshold Gods,</HI> and Fa∣mily Religion (if I may so call it) of the <HI>Heathen;</HI> however brutish and abominable it sometimes was. The <HI>Learned</HI> know well that they had their <HI>Penates,</HI> which were plac'd (we are told<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the History of the <HI>Heathen Gods.</HI></NOTE>) <HI>in penetralibus Domi,</HI> in the innermost places of the House, as the Guardians and Protectors of it, and its sacred Trea∣sure. They had also their <HI>Lares</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lar</HI> is in our Dictionaries D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> <HI>familiaris.</HI> &amp; <HI>Lararium</HI> was the private <HI>Chapel</HI> for the Houshold Deity <HI>Labans Teraphim</HI> seem to have been <HI>Images</HI> for a religious Use, and consulted <HI>as Oracles</HI></NOTE>, another kind of
<PB N="7" REF="003008_0008_0FEF9C9F0969E1B0"/><HI>Domestic Gods,</HI> on which they bestow'd the figure of a <HI>dog,</HI> to express Watchfulness and care of the House.</P>
<P>Now however they prostituted their Reason, and debas'd Religion, vilely acting like fools and beasts in these <HI>Idolatries;</HI> yet we may piously and justly reason thus with our selves therefrom; That the <HI>Remains</HI> of natural light, and <HI>Tradition,</HI> taught these miserable Families of Men, that there ought to be religious Worship in their Housholds. For tho' they <HI>chang'd the Truth of</HI> GOD <HI>into a lye,</HI> yet their Consciences <HI>bare a Witness</HI> to the Truth before us, and shew'd the <HI>Work of the Law written in their Hearts.</HI> How <HI>vain</HI> soever these their <HI>Imaginations</HI> were, and how grossly soever <HI>their foolish heart was darkned;</HI> yet their <HI>Houshold Idolatries</HI> may rise up in Judg∣ment against the more profane <HI>Christians</HI> and con∣demn them.</P>
<P N="2">2. But I come to argue from <HI>Scripture</HI> and reveal'd Religion. Only let me <HI>premise,</HI> 'That there are some things, and those some of the most important in Religion, both of Doctrine and of Practice, which are so plain from the light of Nature, and such evi∣dent Deductions from the first and more general Principles of Religion; that the <HI>Scripture</HI> rather sup∣poses them and takes 'em for granted, than particu∣larly teaches or requires them. And such a Doctrine and Duty I take <HI>this</HI> of FAMILY WORSHIP to be.</P>
<P><HI>Revelation</HI> would not suppose Mankind so ignorant or profane, as to need a direct and positive <HI>Law</HI> for <HI>Family Worship.</HI> A GOD, a <HI>Family,</HI> and <HI>Law</HI> for Worship, must imply and infer Family Worship. — And bear this in mind, That right <HI>Deductions</HI> and true <HI>Consequences</HI> from the Scripture, are just and pro∣per Scripture proofs. Witness our SAVIOURS <HI>Argu∣ment</HI> for the Resurrection of the Body. Luke xx. 47.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="003008_0009_0FEF9CA0AE9C7EC0"/>
This being promis'd, I shall now gather up some of the <HI>Notices</HI> and Intimations of the Mind of GOD from his <HI>Word</HI> about Family Worship; amounting to a plain <HI>Revelation</HI> of his Will in the matter; and then go over some Scripture <HI>Examples</HI> for the Duty: In both of which I shall keep to the <HI>Order</HI> of Scripture.</P>
<P>The <HI>first Family</HI> was sanctified to GOD in the day wherein it was form'd and constituted. When the LORD GOD bro't <HI>Eve</HI> to <HI>Adam</HI> he blessed them toge∣ther, and thereby set them apart for Himself to be a holy Pair, a religious devoted Family. And the first thing we read of in <HI>Adam</HI>'s Family is his <HI>Sons</HI> wor∣shiping the LORD in his appointed Way. And tho' it be true, that this was their open worshiping apart, yet it leads us into the certain knowledge of <HI>Adam</HI>'s worshiping with them, and of his instituting them as well by <HI>Example</HI> as by <HI>Instruction</HI> and <HI>Precept</HI> in the appointed Worship of GOD.</P>
<P>When <HI>Noah</HI> and his <HI>Sons</HI> came out of the <HI>Ark</HI> the preserved Family made their solemn <HI>Thank-Offering</HI> of every kind. This was indeed as much an Act of <HI>public</HI> Worship as could then be render'd to GOD, yet it is as true that it was, and could be, no other than a <HI>Family</HI> Worship.</P>
<P>Afterward the pure Worship of GOD was preserved in the Houshold and Family of <HI>Abraham,</HI> who as he journeyed from place to place <HI>built Altars unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>and called on his Name</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Gen. xii. 7, 8.</NOTE>. His praise and ho∣nour in the sight of GOD was the religious Order of his <HI>Houshold</HI><NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">xviii. 19.</NOTE>. <HI>I know him that he will command his Children and his Houshold after him, and they shall keep the Way of the</HI> LORD. GOD gave him the Cove∣nant of <HI>Circumcision,</HI> which was a <HI>Family Ordinance,</HI> for the <HI>Consecration</HI> of the Houshold to GOD; and indeed of all the <HI>Heads</HI> of all the Families that should
<PB N="9" REF="003008_0010_0FEF9CA47A13A918"/>descend from him. Doubtless express and solemn Worship accompanied the Act of Circumcision, that <HI>Seal of the Righteousness of Faith.</HI> Every Family therefore from the loyns of <HI>Abraham</HI> were hereby put in the way of Family Worship. For were <HI>the Children holy?</HI> And must not the <HI>Parent</HI> see the mark and sign of GOD'S Covenant put upon them? And yet afterward might he bring up the <HI>devoted Seed</HI> without praying with them?</P>
<P>But to pass to the <HI>Law of Moses:</HI> The <HI>Passover</HI> was the other Seal of GOD'S Covenant from <HI>his</HI> time, and it was a <HI>Family</HI> Ordinance. The <HI>Master</HI> of the House had this Care laid upon him. Exod. xii. 3. There was a <HI>Lamb</HI> for a House: They eat it as <HI>holy Societies,</HI> in religious manner; it was <HI>a Feast to the</HI> LORD thro'out their Generations. The Family re∣new'd their Covenant with GOD, and were anew sanctified to him, in their celebrating this Ordinance of Worship.</P>
<P>Or let us look into the Law of the <HI>Holy Sabbath,</HI> and it seems to cast a special eye on the Religion and Worship of the <HI>Houshold,</HI> laying the Head of the Family under the Charge of GOD in that matter; <HI>Thou, thy Son and thy Daughter, thy Man-servant and thy Maid-servant.</HI> — Look also into the Laws for the <HI>Feast of Weeks and of Tabernacles,</HI> and they are given in like manner; Deut. xvi. 10, 14. <HI>Thou shalt rejoice before the</HI> LORD <HI>thy</HI> GOD, <HI>thou and thy Son and thy Daughter,</HI> &amp;c. Or look into the Rule for solemn <HI>Mourning,</HI> as on the day of <HI>Fasting</HI> and Supplication, and it runs thus, Zech. xii. 10. <HI>Every Family apart,</HI> and Person <HI>apart.</HI> Truly it is the Will of GOD that on the Sabbath-day, and upon all days of public Fasting or Thanksgiving, there be special Exercises of Religion performed with our Families, as well as in our Closets or in public Assemblies.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="003008_0011_0FEF9CA96BB777A0"/>
Pass we now to the Scriptures of the <HI>New Testa∣ment,</HI> and we find there many Precepts and Directi∣ons of GOD our SAVIOUR, which do more plainly im∣ply and infer the Duty of Family Worship. Such are those Words of the <HI>Apostle,</HI> Ephes. vi. 18. <HI>Praying</HI> ALWAYS <HI>with</HI> ALL <HI>Prayer, and watching thereunto with all perseverance. "All Prayer</HI> must mean all <HI>kinds</HI> of Prayer; public, private, secret; solitary and social. But Family prayer is <HI>one</HI> kind of Prayer, and there∣fore to be attended <HI>always,</HI> and watch'd unto with all perseverance.</P>
<P>Another Text that seems to look to Family Prayer is that, Philip. iv. 6. <HI>Be careful for nothing, but in e∣very thing by Prayer and Supplication let your Requests be made known to</HI> GOD. Men are in a special manner apt to be <HI>careful</HI> and anxious how to provide for their Housholds, how to feed and clothe their Fami∣lies; But let Family <HI>Prayer</HI> and secret Prayer be the Antidote and sovereign Remedy against this sick∣ly and painful disorder of our Minds. Carry the care of your Families to GOD in daily Prayers. But shall this be only in Secret? Why not also in Pray∣ers with them?</P>
<P>Another place that has a fair Aspect on Family Worship is Col. iii. 17. <HI>And whatsoever ye do in word or deed do all in the Name of the</HI> LORD JESUS, <HI>giving Thanks unto</HI> GOD <HI>and the</HI> FATHER <HI>by Him.</HI> In the verse before the Exhortation is, <HI>Let the Word of</HI> CHRIST <HI>dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in Psalms</HI> &amp;c. And in the verse after <HI>Wives</HI> are exhorted <HI>to submit themselves unto their own Husbands as is fit in the</HI> LORD. Whatsoever there∣fore is done <HI>in the Houshold,</HI> in word or deed, is di∣rected to be done <HI>in the Name of</HI> CHRIST, with conti∣nual Thanksgiving to GOD. — And then in the be∣ginning of the next <HI>Chapter, Masters</HI> of Families are required to <HI>continue in prayer, and to watch in the
<PB N="11" REF="003008_0012_0FEF9CAB0AB53DD0"/>same with Thanksgiving.</HI> These Precepts are directed to <HI>Housholders</HI> by name, to continue in daily Prayers and Praises <HI>with their Families.</HI> This seems the most fair and easy, natural and genuine <HI>sense</HI> of the Pre∣cept in this place.</P>
<P>Again we are taught and commanded, I. Thess. v. 17, 18. to <HI>pray without ceasing, and in every thing to give Thanks.</HI> If <HI>in every thing,</HI> then surely in our Families, for all Family Mercies. — A like Precept we have I. Tim. ii. 8. <HI>I will that Men pray every where, lifting up holy Hands without Wrath.</HI> If <HI>every where,</HI> then surely in our <HI>Houses,</HI> and with our <HI>Housholds.</HI> This is one of the <HI>first</HI> places that occur to us. And the <HI>Caution</HI> of holy Hands, without Wrath, is pecu∣liarly proper to <HI>Housholds,</HI> where Angers and Wraths do especially unfit for holy Prayers. — It follows, <HI>Let the Women adorn themselves with Sobriety and good Works,</HI> and <HI>let the Woman learn in Silence with all Sub∣jection; for Adam was first formed and then Eve.</HI> Which seems to determine the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s meaning in foregoing <HI>Discourse</HI> to Family Prayer.</P>
<P>Moreover, That our <HI>Houses</HI> should be places for Prayer, and that there should be occasional Prayers with the <HI>Houshold,</HI> is plain from the Commandment and Direction of the Apostle <HI>James,</HI> v. 14, 15. <HI>Is any sick among you? let him call for the Elders of the Church, and let them pray over him —.</HI> But is <HI>this</HI> the only Occasion that there is for social Prayer in Families? Should there be Prayer on <HI>this</HI> Occasion with the Houshold, and on no other? Or if the <HI>Eld∣ers of the Church</HI> must be called on this, or the like Occasion, is not the <HI>Master of the Family</HI> to pray and give Thanks with it on many other Occasions? And are not such Occasions frequently and daily return∣ing on us? And if on <HI>greater</HI> Occasions there should be more <HI>solemn</HI> and formal Supplications in the House and for it, should there be no prayers in it and for
<PB N="12" REF="003008_0013_0FEF9CAD399D5FD8"/>it on <HI>lesser</HI> and more ordinary Occasions, returning every day? Or if <HI>one</HI> of the Family be taken dan∣gerously <HI>Sick</HI> once in the year, or in several years, and this be a loud Call for the <HI>Prayers</HI> of the Hous∣hold; Is not the continued <HI>Health</HI> of <HI>all</HI> the Family from day to day, and it may be from year to year, as loud a Call for the united daily <HI>Thanksgivings</HI> of the Houshold?</P>
<P>But to look into the Epistles of <HI>Peter</HI> and close with him. How applicable to Families and Family Worship are his Words, I. Epist. ii. 5. <HI>A spiritual House, an holy Priesthood, to offer up spiritual Sacrifi∣ces, acceptable to</HI> GOD, <HI>thro'</HI> JESUS CHRIST. The <HI>Church</HI> of GOD is a <HI>spiritual House,</HI> and so should our <HI>Families</HI> be also. <HI>Believers</HI> in CHRIST are a <HI>holy Priesthood,</HI> but in a special manner to their <HI>Housholds;</HI> to offer up <HI>with them</HI> (as well as by themselves in secret) the spiritual <HI>Sacrifices</HI> of Praise and Prayer. — See also I. Peter iii. 7. <HI>Let the Husbands dwell with them according to knowledge, giving honour to the Wife as to the weaker Vessel,</HI> and as being <HI>Heirs to∣gether of the Grace of Life, that your</HI> PRAYERS <HI>be not hindred.</HI> The several <HI>Relatives</HI> in a Family should live together as Heirs of the Grace of Life; there∣fore they should pray, both together and apart, for one another: But especially the Care about the Prayers of the Houshold lies on the Head of the Family. It is supposed that there be Prayers <HI>in</HI> the Family; that the Husband pray for and with the Wife; and why not the latter as well as the former? And the Husband is wisely directed to treat the Wife with Tenderness, to bear with her Infirmities, and by governing himself well toward her to keep up love and peace in the Family; That so <HI>their Prayers,</HI> and those of the Houshold, whether together or apart, <HI>be not hindred.</HI></P>
<P>These are some of the <HI>Notices</HI> and Intimations of the Mind of GOD in his <HI>Word</HI> about <HI>Family Worship;</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="003008_0014_0FEF9CB239A16EE8"/>amounting (as I judge) to a plain Revelation of his Will in the matter, and so to a Precept and Injunc∣tion concerning it.</P>
<P>I conclude this Head with the Words of the vene∣rable Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI> on this Argument; "Let me tell you (says he) that it is <HI>Ignorance</HI> to call for <HI>particu∣lar</HI> and express <HI>Scriptures</HI> that require praying in Families, as if we tho't the <HI>general Commands</HI> were not sufficient, and did not comprehend this parti∣cular.</P>
<P>I come now to consider the <HI>Scripture Examples</HI> for Family Worship: By which I mean what we find related and recorded concerning one Person and a∣nother, bearing a favourable Aspect on this Practice.</P>
<P>I might name <HI>Adam, Noah</HI> and <HI>Abraham,</HI> but for∣bear, having hinted at them before. <HI>Iacob</HI> was a like godly Worshiper with his Houshold, having learn'd it of his pious <HI>Ancestors,</HI> and inheriting the Spirit with the Blessing of <HI>Abraham.</HI> He died, as he liv'd, worshiping with his Sons around him, pouring out Prayers for them, and blessing them, one by one, in the Name of the LORD.</P>
<P><HI>Job</HI> was a like devout Worshiper of GOD with his Family. GOD gave him <HI>seven Sons and three Daugh∣ters,</HI> and as in their <HI>Childhood</HI> he had daily worship'd with them, so when they were <HI>adult,</HI> and setled in Houses of their own, he frequently call'd them toge∣ther to worship with him: <HI>He sent for them and sanc∣tified them, offering Burnt-Offerings, according to the number of them all: Thus did Job continually.</HI> These were his Family Sacrifices, and he was very constant and solemn in them.</P>
<P><HI>Joshua</HI> gave his sense of Family Religion, the De∣votion and Worship of the Houshold, in that famous and noble <HI>Resolve,</HI> Josh. xxiv. 15. <HI>As for me and my House, we will serve the</HI> LORD. He resolv'd for him∣self and his Houshold, those that were his immediate
<PB N="14" REF="003008_0015_0FEF9CB5BAEDA9B0"/>Charge and Care, living under his roof. Himself and his house he joyns in the Worship, for they daily joyn'd in it. <HI>"I and my Domestics,</HI> I with them and they with me; I and they together and apart. He spake as the Master and Head of a Family.</P>
<P><HI>Jesse,</HI> the Father of <HI>David,</HI> was a religious <HI>Hous∣holder</HI> and worship'd GOD with his Family. <HI>David</HI> speaks of occasional <HI>Sacrifices</HI> in his Fathers house. 1. Sam. xx. 6. They had their <HI>annual</HI> or <HI>monthly</HI> Sacrifices, and why not the daily?</P>
<P><HI>David</HI> had learn'd of his pious Father, and was taught of GOD <HI>to bless his Houshold;</HI> i. e. to pray and give thanks with them, to GOD, for his Blessing on them. This became so great a <HI>King,</HI> and so illustrious a <HI>Saint,</HI> the <HI>Man after</HI> GOD's <HI>own Heart.</HI> Who would wish for a better Pattern or Teacher? Would to GOD that all <HI>Kings</HI> would learn of him, all <HI>Rulers</HI> imitate him, in the Devotions of their Hous∣holds. To be sure all <HI>Saints</HI> will gladly follow his more than <HI>royal</HI> Example. The least and <HI>lowest</HI> a∣mong us may have a Houshold to rule and <HI>bless,</HI> and has this Authority in his own House, as much as the Prince hath in his. II. Sam. vi. 20. <HI>Then David returned to bless his Houshold.</HI> From an extraordina∣ry Act of solemn <HI>public</HI> Devotion, from blessing the Congregation of <HI>Israel,</HI> both as a Prophet and their Prince, he came <HI>home</HI> and bless'd his <HI>Family</HI> in the Name of the LORD. He bless'd and prais'd GOD with <HI>them</HI> that day, and implor'd his Blessing on them. Every Man is a <HI>King</HI> and a <HI>Priest</HI> in his own House, to <HI>rule</HI> for GOD and to lead in his Worship. <HI>He returned</HI> to bless his House: It seems to speak his Custom and <HI>Use</HI> to bless it. Was this the <HI>only</HI> time? or the first or last time that <HI>David</HI> returned from GOD's House to bless his own? No, it seems to have been no <HI>new</HI> thing to Him or them. He was wont to do so on <HI>Sabbaths</HI> and other <HI>Festivals.</HI> His Hous∣hold
<PB N="15" REF="003008_0016_0FEF9CB8F28BF100"/>no doubt expected Him; and were in waiting to receive his Blessing. <HI>Michal</HI> alone was out of frame, but not so the <HI>Maids of Honour</HI> attending her.</P>
<P>I will name but one more <HI>Example</HI> from the <HI>Old</HI> Testament: It is <HI>Daniel. Three times a day</HI> he wor∣ship'd GOD openly and solemnly in his House. How else should his <HI>Enemies</HI> have known his Practice, or been able to have convicted him as they did? Had it been the Worship of his <HI>Closet,</HI> the Rule ever was and is <HI>to shut the window and the door, and pray to Him that sees in Secret.</HI> But <HI>Daniel</HI>'s daily Prayers were open in the sight and hearing of his Enemies. Doubtless it was the Worship in his <HI>Chapel,</HI> or of his Houshold together.. Dan. vi. 10, 11. <HI>Now when Da∣niel knew that the Writing was signed, he went into his House, and his windows being open in his Chamber to∣ward Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed and gave Thanks before his</HI> GOD, <HI>as he did aforetime: Then these Men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making Supplication before his</HI> GOD. Judge if this be not meant of <HI>Daniel</HI>'s Worship with his Houshold, rather than his retired Devotions by him∣self. Neither Morning nor Evening prayer were wanting in <HI>Daniel</HI>'s house. They that pleas'd might make themselves <HI>Witnesses</HI> of the Worship of his House, nor would he change the <HI>Order</HI> of it for the Kings Decree. The door of his <HI>Chapel</HI> stood open for his <HI>Brethren</HI> of the Dispersion and others. He chose to <HI>die</HI> rather than cease his Family Worship for <HI>thirty days.</HI></P>
<P>From the Scriptures of the <HI>New Testament</HI> I shall only name our LORD Himself, and <HI>Cornelius</HI> the first-fruit of the Gentiles.</P>
<P>JESUS is the great <HI>Pattern</HI> to his Church; the pat∣tern of <HI>Prayer</HI> and Devotion, <HI>alone</HI> by Himself and <HI>with</HI> his Disciples. The Families of the Earth are
<PB N="16" REF="003008_0017_0FEF9CBDCDF3BF30"/><HI>blessed</HI> in Him, with respect to his <HI>Example</HI> in this point. He has taught them to pray both together and apart. JESUS had a <HI>Family.</HI> He chose and or∣dained the <HI>Twelve</HI> to be with him. Mark iii. 14. They attended him wherever He went, as his pro∣per <HI>Domestics.</HI> Tho' He had not where to lay his Head, yet there was a Family Relation between <HI>Him</HI> and the <HI>Twelve,</HI> of Master and Servants, Teach∣er and Scholars. <HI>They left all and followed Him.</HI> He called them his <HI>Houshold,</HI> and Himself the <HI>Master of the House.</HI> Matth. x. 25. And as such he <HI>fed</HI> them from day to day, and eat the <HI>Passover</HI> with them. Mark xiv. 14. He often <HI>taught</HI> them in private, and <HI>pray'd</HI> with them in private, as his Domestics. Luke ix. 18. <HI>As he was alone praying, his Disciples were with him</HI> i. e. He was praying with them, by them∣selves only. He was not alone by Himself, for the Disciples were with him. It was a Family Prayer. It was neither public nor secret Prayer, but private with his Houshold. And such we may call his wondrous Prayer just before his Passion, John. xvii. What a famous and glorious Instance was this of Fa∣mily Worship, on an extraordinary Occasion? where∣in therefore our LORD was the more inlarged and af∣fectionate. Thus JESUS is the Pattern for Family Worship to all Worshipers.</P>
<P>And <HI>whom</HI> shall we name after Him? Which of the <HI>Houshold? Peter,</HI> or <HI>James,</HI> or <HI>John?</HI> Neither of the <HI>Twelve,</HI> tho' doubtless they followed the Ex∣ample of JESUS in this Duty; But let CORNELIUS (a Gentile Worshiper, <HI>a Centurion of the Italian Band</HI>) have this Honour; as <HI>a good Soldier of</HI> JESUS CHRIST. We have his excellent Character, Acts x. 2. <HI>A de∣vout Man, and one that feared</HI> GOD <HI>with all his House, and prayed to</HI> GOD <HI>always. As he was praying in his House, he had a Vision of an Angel of</HI> GOD; <HI>behold a Man stood before him in bright clothing.</HI> The best
<PB N="17" REF="003008_0018_0FEF9CC0B6E81B48"/><HI>Expositors</HI> take it for a pregnant Instance of Houshold Worship. And if so, it was a good Beginning, a good and leading Example, among the <HI>Gentile</HI> Con∣verts. He prayed <HI>always,</HI> with <HI>all his House.</HI> It was at the <HI>ninth Hour,</HI> the time of the <HI>Evening</HI> Sacrifice. If it was a Family Prayer, GOD put a double honour on it; By <HI>one</HI> Vision he directed <HI>Cornelius</HI> to send for <HI>Peter,</HI> and by <HI>another</HI> he prepar'd <HI>Peter</HI> to go. But above all, He pour'd out the HOLY GHOST upon these Gentile Worshipers, while <HI>Peter</HI> preach'd to to them. Thus did the HOLY ONE own and honour the Prayers of <HI>Cornelius</HI> and his <HI>Houshold.</HI> Let it encourage and confirm all believing Housholders in the practice of Family-prayer.</P>
<P>Methinks the <HI>elect Lady and her Children</HI> were such a Family of Devotion; and <HI>Lydia</HI> and her House; and so <HI>Priscilla</HI> and <HI>Aquila, Nymphas</HI> and <HI>Philemon, with the Church in their House.</HI> Probably their Chris∣tian Neighbours might meet for Worship at these Houses on <HI>Lord's days</HI> and at other times. But doubt∣less the Families were <HI>as little Churches,</HI> and worthy to be so called because of the good <HI>Order</HI> and daily <HI>Worship</HI> of GOD in them. "It is fit (says <HI>Calvin</HI>) that all the Families of the Faithful should be so or∣der'd as to deserve <HI>this Honour.</HI> "It rests upon e∣very Head of a Family (says Bp. <HI>Davenant</HI>) so to exercise his Houshold in the true Religion, that it may d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>rvedly obtain the Name of a <HI>Church</HI>". A reli<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/> Family is a holy Community; like the House of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>aham</HI> and <HI>Jacob;</HI> or as the House of <HI>Obed-edom,</HI> wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the <HI>Ark</HI> rested in it. "Religion in the pow∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> of it, reigning in a Family, turns a House into <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hurch". — Such a <HI>Family</HI> had an <HI>Epistle</HI> direc∣ted to them; namely that to <HI>Philemon: To Philemon, our dearly beloved and Fellow-labourer, and to the Church in thy House.</HI> Other <HI>Epistles</HI> were written to the Churches in such a <HI>City</HI> or <HI>Province;</HI> but this to
<PB N="18" REF="003008_0019_0FEF9CC24AA99570"/>a godly <HI>Person</HI> and his religious Houshold: Like one of the Epistles of <HI>John,</HI> to <HI>the elect Lady and her Children.</HI> "It was the Aggravation of the Fault of <HI>Onesimus</HI> (as One observes) that he left such a Family, and ran away from such a Master, where he had been well taught both by Word and Exam∣ple. <Q>All Families should be Nurseries of Religion, as <HI>Philemons</HI> was; i. e. Societies in which GOD is daily call'd upon, where he is daily praised, where his Word is daily read, and the Sabbaths of GOD are rested on, and kept religiously in the private and public Duties of them:</Q> Where GOD's <HI>Law is in the Heart</HI> of Parents, Masters and Mistresses, and is <HI>diligently taught unto the Children.</HI> Such Families are Nurseries for the Church and <HI>Table</HI> of CHRIST, to fill them with worthy <HI>Communicants. Onesimus</HI> upon his Repentance was restored in this Family, as a sinning Member is in the Churches of CHRIST, <HI>above a Servant, a Brother beloved.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have gather'd up the Voice and Sense of <HI>Scripture,</HI> as truly and briefly as I could, on this important point of Family Worship; and have kept very much to the <HI>Order</HI> of Scripture in doing it. From hence have the <HI>Godly</HI> in all Places and Ages of the Church, gone into the practice of this Duty. And all that uprightly practice it have the pleasure, comfort and profit of it. None ever repented of it, or are like to repent of it. These are <HI>the footsteps of the Flocks,</HI> and thus <HI>the Sheep feed,</HI> and their Lambs with them, <HI>besides the Shepherds Tents.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. I come now to give <HI>Rules</HI> and <HI>Directions</HI> a∣bout the Duty of Family Worship.</P>
<P N="1">1. We must be <HI>frequent</HI> and <HI>constant</HI> in the Duty. Let no day pass without secret and family Prayer, reading GOD'S Word, and solemn Thanksgiving to Him for personal and relative Mercies. Let GOD
<PB N="19" REF="003008_0020_0FEF9CC50E8BA9D0"/>have his Dues in thy House, his morning and even∣ing Sacrifices. Psalm xcii. 1 <HI>It is a good thing to give Thanks unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>and to sing Praises to thy Name,</HI> O MOST HIGH! <HI>to shew forth thy Loving kindness in the Morning, and thy Faithfulness every Night.</HI> Psalm v. 2. <HI>My voice shalt thou hear in the Morning, O</HI> LORD! <HI>in the Morning will I direct my Prayer unto Thee, and will look up.</HI> Psalm cxli. 2. <HI>Let my Prayer be set forth before Thee as Incense, and the lifting up of my hands as the Evening Sacrifice.</HI> These stated Exercises should never be omitted, without a plain Necessity constrain to it; but in extraordinary Cases, as those of great Affliction and Sorrow, the Family may need to be pray'd with three and four times a day: And <HI>Days</HI> of Prayer may be call'd for in them.</P>
<P>It was Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s declared Judgment, That the Master of a Family ought rather to omit secret Pray∣er in his Closet, than private Prayer with his Hous∣hold. <Q>Family Prayer (says he) is of greatest Ne∣cessity, because each Person is concerned in it. You must rather take up with Family prayer alone, than with secret alone.</Q> — Let us not on any little pretence, or small occasion, omit this Duty. Let us walk before GOD in our houses in this daily Course. Let us be constant and steddy in it, like the <HI>Sun</HI> in its Circuit, as Day and Night in their return. As the Sun <HI>ariseth</HI> let us get up to worship and serve GOD, <HI>the Father of Light;</HI> And as it <HI>knows its going down,</HI> so let us know and keep our Hour of Evening Prayer.</P>
<P N="2">2. Let us be <HI>seasonable</HI> in Family Worship. It is doubly <HI>beautiful,</HI> pleasant and profitable in its <HI>Season.</HI> Out of season it very much loses its beauty, pleasure and profit. Yet the <HI>Occasions</HI> of Families may cause some <HI>Variety</HI> here. One and the same <HI>Time</HI> will not sure all Families, nor always the same Family. The <HI>Rule</HI> in general is, When the Houshold can be best
<PB N="20" REF="003008_0021_0FEF9CC877A554B0"/>and most <HI>together.</HI> Another is Not too late in the Morning, nor in the Evening.</P>
<P>The <HI>first</HI> looks too slothful, and often comes by drowsing too long in Bed. But let GOD and our <HI>Souls</HI> have the first and fresh Tho'ts of the Morning. Let us not stay to do a good part of the Mornings Work before we wait upon GOD. Fresh and fasting may be a good Rule; healthful to the Soul and ho∣norary to GOD. First let us serve GOD with our Houshold, and then serve our <HI>selves</HI> of them. So let all the Work of the Day be sanctified <HI>early,</HI> by the Word and Prayer. Let GOD'S Work be done before our own. Psalm cviii. <HI>Awake up my Glory, awake early.</HI> The <HI>Letter</HI> here agrees to a <HI>Morning</HI> Song, from an <HI>early</HI> Riser. Such have a great Ad∣vantage both for secret and private Worship.</P>
<P>But more especially let not the <HI>Evening</HI> Prayers be <HI>late</HI> and drowsie, dream'd over half asleep. It is best for Families to be early in bed, and much more to be early in the Evening Worship. Late <HI>Visits</HI> neces∣sarily cause late Prayers in our own and others Fami∣lies. Staying late at the <HI>Tavern</HI> is yet a worse Disor∣der, where the Heads of Families too often keep one another till the Season is past for the Evening Wor∣ship, and they are unfit for either private or secret Prayer. But if we loiter and <HI>trifle</HI> away the Even∣ing in our own Houses, till it grow late and the Hous∣hold are half asleep, it comes near to the same thing. — It is therefore a special <HI>Rule</HI> in the Case before us, that we keep Time and Season in praying with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Families. And truly it might have been even better sometimes to have omitted the holy Service, than to have attended it in the disorders of Sleepiness and Yauning. The <HI>Oblation is vain,</HI> and the <HI>Incense</HI> becomes <HI>an Abomination.</HI> Both GOD and Man is <HI>weary to bear them.</HI></P>
<P N="3"><PB N="21" REF="003008_0022_0FEF9CCC142DAA28"/>
3. We should neither be too <HI>long,</HI> nor too <HI>short,</HI> in Family worship. An Error on either hand is hurtful. <HI>Prolixity</HI> should be carefully avoided; much less should it be affected. It makes the Duty <HI>tedious,</HI> and is the way to b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ak in upon the commanded <HI>La∣bours</HI> of the Day, or necessary <HI>Rest</HI> of the Night. — On the other hand, T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> be <HI>cursory</HI> and slighty in Family Worship is to make <HI>nothing</HI> of it, or <HI>worse</HI> than nothing. Let us not grudge to GOD the Time and Pains of a sutable Supplication and Thanksgiving.</P>
<P><HI>Family prayer</HI> should be rather short than long. But let it be long eno' to answer the Intention and design of it. It is neither to be crouded into a single Peti∣tion or two, nor should it be drawn out into a great length. In all social Prayer the Rule and Caution to us is that, Mat. vi. 7. <HI>Use not vain Repetitions, nor think to be heard for your much speaking.</HI> Yet at some times we are called by Providence, and directed by the SPIRIT of Grace, to be <HI>longer</HI> than other. Wis∣dom is profitable to observe and direct. At times again we may and should <HI>shorten</HI> our Prayers. But see (says Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>) that formal <HI>Affectation</HI> be not the lengthener of your Prayers at any Time, nor carnal <HI>Weariness</HI> the shortner of them.</P>
<P>There are times of Family trials and afflictions, es∣pecially when Sickness and Death come into our Houses, which call us to inlarge our Supplications, with Confessions to GOD, and Humiliations before Him: Again there are times of Family mercies, which call us to abound in Praises and Thanksgivings to GOD: Let Providence lead us, and a Spirit of sin∣cere Devotion act us, and let the Glory of GOD and the Edification of our Houshold direct and govern us.</P>
<P N="4">4. Let us be sure that we be <HI>serious</HI> and <HI>sincere,</HI> and also <HI>reverend solemn and fervent</HI> in the Exercises of Family worship. Let us take heed that we be not
<PB N="22" REF="003008_0023_0FEF9CD09B9D9C50"/>formal and customary, cold and careless, dull and lifeless in the Duty. Let it not be a meer Form and round of Worship. This can't be too earnestly warn'd or watch'd against. GOD looks to the Heart and Spirit in all our Worship. The same Exercise of Grace he requires from us, in the Closet, in the Family, or in the Church. We have to do with the same GOD in all places and at all times, and unto Him we must <HI>lift up</HI> our Souls, and call upon him <HI>in Truth.</HI> The Precept and Rule to us is, Heb. xii. 28. <HI>Let us have Grace whereby we may serve</HI> GOD <HI>accepta∣bly, with Reverence and godly Fear.</HI> He is greatly to be feared in a <HI>Family</HI> of Worshipers, as well as in the Assembly and <HI>Congregation.</HI></P>
<P>And as we must <HI>sanctify the</HI> LORD <HI>in our Hearts,</HI> so we should be grave, reverend and solemn in our Voice, Gesture, Deportment and Behaviour, while we worship GOD in our Families. Indeed we should beware of being noisie and ostentatious in it, not af∣fecting Show or the Observation of Men; but yet neither let us be afraid of being observed, seen or heard by others, but desire to have our <HI>Light shine before</HI> them; if they may be excited hereby <HI>to glori∣fy our</HI> FATHER <HI>which is in Heaven.</HI> Aim at the pleas∣ing and honouring GOD, and the Salvation of thy Self and Family; and by thy <HI>reverend</HI> Example con∣strain the Reverence of thy Houshold; and by thy Earnestness and <HI>Affection</HI> endeavour to move their Affections, and make them in earnest: And by thy Authority command all in thy House to show Seri∣ousness and Reverence. Humility and godly Fear, Faith Love and earnest Desire, with holy Pleasure and Satisfaction, is the Life and Soul of Worship; all in all in it; whether it be in secret, in private or in public.</P>
<P N="5">5. Tye not your Self to a <HI>Form,</HI> nor yet indulge too much <HI>Liberty</HI> of Speech, in Family Worship. A
<PB N="23" REF="003008_0024_0FEF9CD22D5FE7E0"/>good <HI>Form</HI> may be useful and needful for some, but it is not to be advised or chosen without Necessity. The modesty and bashfulness of some understanding Christians is not Reason eno' for such an Indulgence. It were rather fit for some more bold and conceited Persons. A small Gift may suffice for sutable &amp; pertinent Family Prayer. Let us covet the best Gift in it, and do our best; and then the least will be accepted of GOD. But if any use a Form, let him not be <HI>formal</HI> in it, but still <HI>pray with the Spirit and with Understand∣ing.</HI> To such I would recommend the <HI>Forms</HI> prepa∣red by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Henry</HI> in his Book called, <HI>A Method of Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>Some by taking too great <HI>Freedom</HI> in Family pray∣er, have but spoilt the Devotion of the Houshold, and expos'd the Duty to contempt. It had been much better if such had used some <HI>good Form of sound Words.</HI> The wise Housholder must think so∣berly, what will most honour GOD and edify the Family.</P>
<P>Both <HI>Ministers</HI> in public, and Housholders in pri∣vate, should take heed what Liberties they allow themselves in Prayer. And yet, both Families and Congregations must make Allowances, at Times more especially, for Infirmity and Weaknesses in those that lead in Prayer. <HI>Solomon</HI>'s warning and caution is needful to be kept in mind, Eccless. v. 2. <HI>Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thy heart be hasty, to utter any thing before</HI> GOD: <HI>For</HI> GOD <HI>is in Heaven and thou upon Earth; therefore let thy Words be few:</HI> "well considered and digested. That wise <HI>Proverb</HI> of <HI>Solomon</HI> is of great Use, as well in the religious as common Use of Speech; <HI>In the multitude of Words there wanteth not Sin, but he that refraineth his lips is wise.</HI> "It is not eno' (says Mr. <HI>Henry</HI>) that what we speak comes from the <HI>Heart,</HI> but it must come from a <HI>composed</HI> Heart. As the Mouth must not be
<PB N="24" REF="003008_0025_0FEF9CD5A328FDE8"/><HI>rash,</HI> so the Heart must not be <HI>hasty.</HI> We must think <HI>twice</HI> before we speak, either from GOD in <HI>Preaching,</HI> or to GOD in <HI>Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>Let us be careful and reverend in our coming <HI>boldly to the Throne of Grace.</HI> Let us take with us <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Words and Frame, <HI>Behold I have taken up∣on me to speak unto the</HI> LORD, <HI>who am but dust and ashes!</HI></P>
<P N="6">6. On the LORD'S-<HI>day</HI> we should ordinarily be more inlarged in Duties of Worship, both in the Clo∣set and in the Family. <HI>The Day is holy</HI> for this End and Use, that we should spend it in the "public and private Exercises of GOD'S Worship. As we must needs attend the public <HI>Assemblies,</HI> on the LORD'S-day, for <HI>it is a holy Convocation;</HI> So <HI>it is the Sabbath of the</HI> LORD <HI>in our Dwellings.</HI> This is no <HI>Judaizing,</HI> but as it was from the Beginning, is and ever shall be. So we <HI>call the Sabbath our Delight</HI> in the best manner, and <HI>find not our own Pleasure</HI> on it; <HI>think not our own Tho'ts, nor speak our own Words.</HI> As the <HI>Sacrifices</HI> under the <HI>Law</HI> were doubled on the <HI>Sabbath-day,</HI> so it is fitting under the <HI>Gospel</HI> that our Family Sacrifices of Praise and Prayer be inlarg'd and doubled on the LORD'S-<HI>day.</HI> If on other days the <HI>Word</HI> of GOD should be read in our Houses, on <HI>this</HI> more. If Prayer and Praise be requisite every day, surely they are more on the holy Sabbath. Then especially we should remember <HI>the</HI> LORD <HI>our Sanciti∣fier,</HI> and be found in all the Means of our Sanctifica∣tion, whether more private or public. And what is the fruit of the <HI>neglect</HI> of Family worship on the LORD'S-days, but <HI>sports</HI> and <HI>pastimes</HI> on them, and o∣pen profaness and debauchery. Hence comes the loss of all serious Religion, and the growth of all manner of Irreligion. Let us therefore be the more abundant and solemn in Family Worship on the LORD'S <HI>day.</HI> Secret and private Worship thereon
<PB N="25" REF="003008_0026_0FEF9CDB46B8FA50"/>prepares for the public, and that again should inlarge us for the other: As <HI>David</HI> returned from the most solemn Exercises of <HI>public</HI> Devotion, <HI>to bless his own Houshold.</HI> These had not tir'd and unfitted him, but the more prepar'd him for his Family Thanksgiving in the Evening.</P>
<P N="7">7. In our Family prayers let it be a <HI>Rule</HI> with us, that there be much of <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> and <HI>Praise</HI> in the Duty. Indeed GOD sometimes puts our Fa∣milies into Mourning, and calls them to solemn Hu∣miliations, Confessions and Supplications; as hath been said before. Nor ought Confession of Sin, with Supplications for Grace and Mercy, to be ever missing in Family prayers. But we are too apt to be want∣ing in the part of Thanksgiving and Praise, in our daily Devotions, by our Selves or with Others; which is a very ill and ungrateful thing</P>
<P>Our personal and Family <HI>Mercies</HI> are many and great from day to day, and they call for a religious notice every day. In the days of our Afflictions and Mournings, the darkest days that pass over our Houses, our Mercies are <HI>new</HI> every morning and e∣vening, &amp; ought never to be forgotten or overlook'd. How much less in the <HI>Months that</HI> GOD <HI>preserves us,</HI> and while <HI>his Candle is shining on our Tabernacles:</HI> Then should the <HI>Voice of Rejoicing and Thanksgiving</HI> be loud in them, every Morning and Night. — This likewise makes the daily Service <HI>pleasant</HI> to the Hous∣hold, and tends to raise and fix the hearts of the Fa∣mily in the holy Duty; <HI>Praise</HI> being <HI>comely for the Upright,</HI> and the joyful Work of Heaven &amp; Eternity. We should never be weary in it now, as we hope ne∣ver to cease from it hereafter. Psalm civ. ult. <HI>I will sing unto the</HI> LORD <HI>as long as I live, I will sing Praises to my</HI> GOD <HI>while I have my Being. My Meditation of Him shall be sweet, I will be glad in the</HI> LORD.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="003008_0027_0FEF9CDCE2C79C38"/>
The <HI>first</HI> Petition in the LORD'S-<HI>prayer</HI> is, <HI>Thy Name be hallowed,</HI> and Doxology closes it, <HI>For thine is the Kingdom, Power and Glory:</HI> So let us be evermore <HI>awaking up our Glory, to give Praises and not be Silent.</HI></P>
<P>Let no Family <HI>afflictions</HI> unfit us and put us out of Tune for this; no Bereavement or Death in our Houses: But in this Case let us learn of the excellent Example of <HI>Job,</HI> who when his Family and Estate were destroy'd together, fell down in his House and worship'd, saying, <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>gave, and the</HI> LORD <HI>has taken; blessed be the Name of the</HI> LORD! <HI>Shall we receive Good at the Hand of the</HI> LORD, <HI>and shall we not receive Evil?</HI></P>
<P N="8">8. Let <HI>no leven of Wickedness</HI> be found in our Dwel∣lings. This is a necessary and special Direction for the effectual and fervent Worship of GOD in our Families. For <HI>if we regard Iniquity in our hearts, the</HI> LORD <HI>will not hear our Prayers,</HI> Psalm lxvi. 18. Sin spoils all our Worship, of every sort; mental or oral, solitary or social. <HI>The Sacrifice of the wicked is Abo∣mination.</HI> Most wise and necessary is <HI>Zophar</HI>'s Ad∣monition to us, Job xi. 13, 14, 15. <HI>If thou prepare thy Heart, and stretch out thy Hands to</HI> GOD; <HI>if ini∣quity be in thy hand put it away, and let not Wickedness dwell in thy Tabernacle; for then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot.</HI> It is the Rule and Law in <HI>all</HI> Prayer, and at all Times, James iv. 8. <HI>Cleanse your hands ye sinners, and purify your hearts ye double-minded! draw nigh to</HI> GOD <HI>and he will draw nigh to you.</HI> The Man that had been <HI>blind from his birth</HI> knew this, <HI>that</HI> GOD <HI>heareth not Sinners; but if any Man be a Worshiper of</HI> GOD <HI>and doth his Will, him He heareth.</HI> Spoken like <HI>a Child of Light.</HI> As therefore the <HI>Jews</HI> were to <HI>search</HI> their Houses and purge them from <HI>Leven,</HI> in their Preparation for the Solemnity of the <HI>Passover;</HI> so we must <HI>wash our Hearts from wickedness</HI> when we go to pray to our FATHER in
<PB N="27" REF="003008_0028_0FEF9CDF8E560370"/>secret, and <HI>cleanse our Houses</HI> from it, when we go to <HI>bless</HI> them in the Name of the LORD; who will not else bless them at our Prayer. Prov. iii. 33. <HI>The Curse of the</HI> LORD <HI>is in the House of the wicked, but he blesseth the Habitation of the Just.</HI></P>
<P N="9">9. In a particular manner watch against <HI>Anger, Strife &amp; Wrath</HI> in thy Family, that the Worship of GOD in it be not hindred. This <HI>old Leven</HI> spoils the Prayers of Housholds, and makes them become Sin. There is no greater hindrance either of secret or fa∣mily Prayer. It takes away the heart and face for the Duty. The Law to us is, I. Tim. ii. 8. <HI>I will that Men pray every where, lifting up holy Hands, without Wrath.</HI> A wrathful Mind can't lift up a ho∣ly Hand to GOD. The disorder of the Heart pollutes the Prayer. The GOD of Peace and Love can ne∣ver endure the Prayers of a House where there is <HI>Anger and Strife, Confusion and every evil Work.</HI> The hearts of such a Houshold cannot <HI>joyn</HI> in Prayer, and how should GOD accept it? The <HI>Rule</HI> is, <HI>Live in Love, and the</HI> GOD <HI>of Love and Peace shall be with you.</HI> Only such <HI>Relatives</HI> can pray <HI>as Heirs together of the Grace of Life,</HI> I. Pet. iii. 7. GOD would not hear <HI>Job</HI> and his <HI>Friends</HI> pray together, or for one another, after their angry and quarrelling Disputes, till they were reconciled: Job xlii. 8. <HI>Take with you seven Bullocks and seven Rams, and go to my Servant Job; he shall pray for you: And the</HI> LORD <HI>turned away the Captivity of Job, when he prayed for his Friends.</HI> Near Relations are most of all bound to love and pray for one another; but if they fall in the <HI>Love,</HI> they will also in the <HI>Prayers</HI> which they owe to one ano∣ther. Families should be <HI>of one Heart and Soul,</HI> as they are of one <HI>Blood;</HI> and then there is Harmony and Power in their Prayers when they make one Voice to GOD. <HI>If two of you agree on Earth</HI> (said our LORD) <HI>it shall be done for you of my</HI> FATHER
<PB N="28" REF="003008_0029_0FEF9CE553935658"/><HI>which is in Heaven.</HI> When we stand praying we are requir'd to <HI>forgive</HI> our very Enemies, and to <HI>bless them that curse us.</HI> How then can <HI>Families,</HI> which are Societies more especially under the Law and Bonds of mutual Love, unite in Prayers, if <HI>Love</HI> be wanting in them? This is <HI>my</HI> Commandment (said our LORD JESUS) that ye <HI>love</HI> one another: How then can two or three be together <HI>in his Name,</HI> if it be not in the Spirit of Love? There is neither <HI>Church</HI> Communion, nor <HI>Family</HI> Communion, without the <HI>Law of Kindness</HI> and Love ruling in the Hearts of the Members. I. John iv. 7. <HI>Beloved, Let us love one another; for Love is of.</HI> GOD, <HI>and every one that loveth is born of</HI> GOD, <HI>and knoweth</HI> GOD: <HI>He that loveth not knoweth not</HI> GOD, <HI>for</HI> GOD <HI>is Love.</HI></P>
<P N="10">10. "Watch your <HI>worldly Business,</HI> that it do not eat out the Life and Seriousness of daily Worship". This is one of Mr. <HI>Baxter</HI>'s Rules and a very good one. For as <HI>the Friendship of the World is Enmity to</HI> GOD, so nothing is more Inimical to vital Piety, to secret or family Religion, than the Spirit of this World; <HI>the Cares of it and the Deceitfulness of Riches.</HI> These <HI>choke the Word, and it becomes unfruitful;</HI> and these choke and drive away the Spirit of Prayer.</P>
<P>— Some are so taken up with their worldly Cares and Businesses, that they can find no Time or Lei∣sure for Family Prayer. They <HI>rise early, sit up late,</HI> and <HI>eat the Bread of Carefulness;</HI> but neither seek to GOD for it, nor thank him for it, as they ought in their Families, while he daily feeds 'em. <HI>One goes to his Farm, and another to his Merchandize,</HI> but they desire to be <HI>excused</HI> from the Prayers of the Closet and the Family, day by day. They are <HI>cumber'd with many things,</HI> and neglect the <HI>One thing needful;</HI> which is to <HI>sit at</HI> JESUS <HI>feet, and hear his Word,</HI> and come in his Name to the Throne of Grace. — Fami∣ly prayer is not of the World, <HI>even as</HI> CHRIST <HI>is not
<PB N="29" REF="003008_0030_0FEF9CE8C1157358"/>of the World.</HI> It is of the FATHER, and spiritual, and <HI>the World hates it.</HI> — Let the Object and Manner of Worship be wrong and <HI>false,</HI> and the <HI>World goes after the Beast:</HI> Let it be an <HI>Idol</HI> that is worship'd, in a corrupt and carnal manner, only with bodily Ado∣ration, and every Family shall have its <HI>Houshold-God,</HI> of Wood or of Gold; but go to set up the spi∣ritual and pure Worship of GOD in a Family, and the Spirit of this World rises against it, and can't endure it, can't admit of it; but finds a thousand Objections against it and Excuses from it: Then Time can't be found for it, or Inability for it shall be pleaded, or the Necessity of the thing shall be questioned; whereas all the while it is only the Spirit of <HI>Demas</HI> possessing the Person, even <HI>the Love of the present World.</HI> So necessary is the <HI>Apostle</HI>'s Prohibition and Dehortation, I. John ii. 16. <HI>Love not the World, nor the things of the World; if any Man love the World the Love of the</HI> FATHER <HI>is not in him.</HI> A spiritual Mind, abstracted from this World and the things of it, is absolutely necessary to a Life of daily spiritual Worship. <HI>This is the Victory that overcometh the World, even our Faith.</HI> It is true, that <HI>Diligence</HI> in our worldly Callings must accompany our daily Pray∣ers in our Families; else we tempt GOD and put our selves out of the way of his <HI>Blessing.</HI> That gives us our daily Bread, and we must ask it of GOD. And the <HI>Rule</HI> to us is that, Philip. iv. 5, 6. <HI>Let your Mode∣ration be known unto all men, for the</HI> LORD <HI>is at hand; Be careful for nothing, but in every thing by Prayer and Supplication, with Thanksgiving let your Requests be made known unto</HI> GOD.</P>
<P N="11">11. In the choice of your worldly <HI>Callings,</HI> in put∣ting out your <HI>Children,</HI> and in making <HI>Marriages</HI> for your Selves and Them; have a due Respect unto this Duty and Priviledge of <HI>Family Worship.</HI> Chuse not to settle in such a Way as will not well consist
<PB N="30" REF="003008_0031_0FEF9CEA63E68570"/>with this Duty. Prefer that Business, and way of Living, which will best agree with the Religion of the Closet and of the Houshold. For this Advan∣tage think it worth while to abate something of worldly Gains. Chuse not to put your Children in∣to such Families where the Worship of GOD is not upheld; and much less be willing to marry them to such Persons who are like to be disinclin'd thereunto. So let us endeavour to preserve and propagate Fa∣mily Religion from Generation to Generation.</P>
<P N="12">12. And lastly, Let all our Family Sacrifices be presented to GOD in the Name of JESUS, <HI>in Whom all the Families of the Earth are blessed.</HI> Carry thy Houshold daily, and all thy Family Worship, to the Blood of the great Sacrifice, CHRIST <HI>our Passover.</HI> Get all the Souls of thy House, and all thy Prayers for them, <HI>sprinkled</HI> with the blood of the LAMB. That shall secure thy House from deserved Wrath, and procure for it all the Blessings it needs. By Faith in a sacrificed <HI>Saviour,</HI> the <HI>Lamb slain,</HI> we may plead, and <HI>wrestle,</HI> and <HI>prevail</HI> for our Selves and Ours, as <HI>Iacob</HI> did. He wrestled with the <HI>Angel of the Cove∣nant</HI> for his Houshold, and was named <HI>Israel.</HI> Go thou, in the Name and Strength of CHRIST and <HI>do likewise.</HI> He is <HI>a merciful and faithful High-Priest,</HI> to pray for thee, to breathe in thee, and to <HI>bear away the Iniquity of thy holy Things.</HI> If He <HI>wash not</HI> Us, our Offspring, and our Offerings, how shall we be accepted by the <HI>Holy</HI> GOD? If he put the <HI>Incense</HI> of his Merits to thy Prayers, they shall come up be∣fore GOD <HI>a sweet Odour.</HI></P>
<P>And thus I have given <HI>Rules and Directions</HI> about the Duty of Family Worship.</P>
<P N="4">IV. An <HI>Exhortation,</HI> with <HI>Motives</HI> to the Duty, do yet remain. Let us be <HI>exhorted</HI> to the Practice of this Duty, in that wise and religious <HI>Manner</HI> which
<PB N="31" REF="003008_0032_0FEF9CEC1A8D0EE0"/>has been directed to. Let such as are in this holy Practice in their Houses, be exhorted to continue therein, in the Fear of GOD. And let those that are Strangers to the Practice be admonished and warned in the Fear of GOD to come into it. And to move both the one and the other, let me plead with them, for GOD'S <HI>sake,</HI> for the sake of their <HI>Families,</HI> for their <HI>own</HI> sake, and for the sake of the <HI>Public,</HI> both in Church and State. — These are plain <HI>Motives</HI> and powerful <HI>Arguments,</HI> and should sink down into our Hearts; both to <HI>convince</HI> those that do not daily read the Word of GOD to their Houshold, and pray with them, of their Sin in this Omission and Neglect; and to <HI>encourage</HI> and confirm Others to persevere in this Duty by the Grace of GOD.</P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then, <HI>For</HI> GOD'S <HI>sake,</HI> for the Glory of his Name; from <HI>Love</HI> to Him and from <HI>Fear</HI> of Him; to please Him, to obtain his Favour, and to avoid his Wrath; let us all come into and continue in this religious Practice of Family Worship. The <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD should be ever uppermost in our Hearts, and ly with weight there; it being <HI>the chief End of Man:</HI> And all our Endowments, with all the Advantages which GOD puts into our. hands, should be made to subserve thereunto. In like manner, Nothing should come with more force and power on us, to deter us from living in the Allowance of any Evil, or in the Neglect of any commanded Duty, than the <HI>Disho∣nour</HI> we bring thereby to the Name of GOD.</P>
<P>Now what doth the <HI>Glory of</HI> GOD call for from us in our Families? Let us put it to our own <HI>Consci∣ences,</HI> and let our Reason and Understanding impar∣tially answer. Is it not for the <HI>Honour of</HI> GOD, and for our glorifying Him together, that we daily and devoutly worship Him with our Houshold? And is it no <HI>Dishonour</HI> to the Great GOD if he is not so wor∣ship'd, day by day? tho' He be the Founder of
<PB N="32" REF="003008_0033_0FEF9CEEF73F2C58"/>the Family, its Preserver and dully Benefactor! tho' It is HE has formed the <HI>Head</HI> and every <HI>Member</HI> of the Family; has brought them together and <HI>built</HI> them up into a Houshold? His <HI>Secret</HI> has been on the <HI>Tabernacle;</HI> his <HI>Candle</HI> shining on it, his <HI>Eyes</HI> watch∣ing over it, his <HI>Hands</HI> supplying it plentifully; tho' it is HE that has <HI>girt</HI> it with strength, bless'd the small <HI>Beginning</HI> of it, and increased the latter <HI>End</HI> of it. Or if it be <HI>afflicted,</HI> its <HI>Afflictions</HI> come not out of the <HI>Dust,</HI> nor does its <HI>Troubles</HI> spring out of the <HI>Ground;</HI> but it is the <HI>Rod of</HI> GOD upon it, which he only can <HI>remove;</HI> or <HI>sanctify,</HI> which is far the better. How then can GOD be glorified in the <HI>House,</HI> if in every Case he be not religiously regard∣ed in all his <HI>Ways</HI> toward it; and that by all the Houshold together, as well as every Member apart? — As our Father <HI>Jacob</HI> in all his Family <HI>Mercies,</HI> and in all his Family <HI>Afflictions,</HI> gave the same Glory to GOD; in all his <HI>Fears</HI> concerning them, and in all his <HI>Joys</HI> in them. When he look'd upon his <HI>Sub∣stance,</HI> his Word was, The LORD <HI>has given me</HI> these Flocks: When he look'd upon his <HI>Houshold,</HI> he said, <HI>I pass'd this Jordan with my Staff, and</HI> GOD <HI>has made me two Bands:</HI> When he <HI>fear'd</HI> for his Family he carried them to GOD and wrestled in Prayer for them; <HI>O</HI> GOD <HI>of my Father! deliver me I pray thee from the hand of my Brother; for I fear him, lest he come and sinite the Mother with the Children.</HI></P>
<P>This is to give <HI>Glory</HI> unto GOD as the GOD of our Families. And thus we teach our <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Ser∣vants</HI> to glorify GOD with us; to know Him, to love him, and to fear him, to pray unto and praise Him by themselves alone. This is better done by Exam∣ple and Practice before them every day, than any other way we can think of. Not that other ways should be omitted, but this to be sure observed. So <HI>Eleazar,</HI> the Servant of <HI>Abraham,</HI> learn'd to acknow∣ledge
<PB N="33" REF="003008_0034_0FEF9CF1B2B9EA88"/>the LORD GOD of his Master in all his ways; to depend on Him, to seek him and give him Glory, in every Affair and Concern of the Family; and more especially in the greater and more important ones: When therefore he stood by the <HI>Well</HI> he pray'd, Gen. xxiv. 12. <HI>O</HI> LORD GOD <HI>of my Master Abraham! I pray thee send me good speed this day, and show kind∣ness to my Master Abraham: Behold I stand by the Well &amp;c.</HI> And when GOD had given him the Token of his Favour which he had pray'd for, <HI>the Man won∣dring at the Thing bowed down his Head and worshiped,</HI> and said, <HI>Blessed be the</HI> LORD GOD <HI>of my Master Abraham, who has not left my Master destitute of his Mercy and Truth; I being in the Way, the</HI> LORD <HI>hath led me to the House of my Masters Brethren.</HI></P>
<P>Thus Children and Servants learn to honour and reverence GOD by living in Worshiping Families. And so GOD has Glory not only from the <HI>Head</HI> of the House, but from many a <HI>Branch</HI> of it; the high∣er &amp; lower Members of it. So it seems to have been in the happy House of <HI>Cornelius, who feared</HI> GOD <HI>with all his House, and prayed unto</HI> GOD <HI>always.</HI> — In a word, By <HI>Family</HI> Worship we train up our Families for the Worship both of the <HI>Closet</HI> and of the <HI>Tem∣ple;</HI> and teach our Housholds to pray both in secret and in public. And so the <HI>Glory</HI> given by Ours un∣to GOD in <HI>both,</HI> may be very much owing to the Worship in the <HI>Family.</HI></P>
<P>For GOD'S <HI>sake</HI> therefore, and for the <HI>Glory</HI> of his Name, let us be found in the holy Practice of Fa∣mily Worship: which is the <HI>first</HI> Motive.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> For our <HI>Family and Houshold's sake,</HI> for our Children and Servants sake, let us not live with∣out Family Worship; but in the daily and devout practice of it. Let me plead with such as neglect this Duty, for the precious <HI>Souls</HI> committed to their Care by GOD the Father of Spirits; which ought to
<PB N="34" REF="003008_0035_0FEF9CF50EA033A0"/>dear to them and for whom they must give Account to GOD. Be prevailed on by the natural, strong and tender Love which you bear to your <HI>Offspring;</HI> and by that Care and Concern which you are bound to have for the <HI>Servants</HI> in your House, to keep up the Worship of GOD therein.</P>
<P>The <HI>Apostle</HI> tells us, That <HI>if any man provide not for those of his own House</HI> (meaning their <HI>Bodies</HI>) <HI>he hath denied the Faith, and is worse than an Infidel.</HI> I. Tim. v. 8. What an <HI>infidel</HI> House then is that, wherein the <HI>Souls</HI> of the Houshold are utterly neg∣lected; and the Children and Servants are train'd up in Ignorance of GOD, in Irreligion and Profaness; without reading GOD'S Word to them, and without Prayer to Him for them, from day to day? How should such Children learn the Fear of the LORD, without which they perish? <HI>O destroy</HI> not those <HI>Souls for which</HI> CHRIST <HI>died;</HI> and which should be to thee as thy own <HI>Bowels,</HI> and more than so. While you are far from hating their <HI>Flesh,</HI> why should you not tenderly care for their better and immortal Part, their living <HI>Spirits?</HI> Can you pretend that you love your Family, without a religious and godly Care for their Souls?</P>
<P>How did <HI>Abraham</HI>'s Love work toward his Hous∣hold? GOD tells us how he lov'd his GOD and his Family; Gen xviii. 19. <HI>For I know Abraham, that he will command his Children and his Houshold after him to keep the Way of the</HI> LORD. So <HI>Job</HI>'s Love to his <HI>Sons</HI> and <HI>Daughters</HI> wro't by his fearing for them, lest they should sin against GOD, and by his calling them to his solemn Sacrifices, which he offered for them. So <HI>David</HI>'s Love wro't, to his Houshold; even in his <HI>blessing them</HI> from time to time in the Name of the LORD; and also in teaching and charg∣ing them, I. Chron. xxviii. 9. <HI>And thou S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>mon, my Son, Know thou the GOD of thy Father, and serve him
<PB N="35" REF="003008_0036_0FEF9CF6A682DB30"/>with a perfect Heart &amp;c.</HI> Every religious <HI>Parent</HI> feels within himself the moving Words of the great <HI>Apostle</HI> to the <HI>Elect Lady</HI> concerning her <HI>Children; I have no greater Joy than to hear of thy Children walking in the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>In a word, How can <HI>Masters</HI> be just to their Ser∣vants, as knowing that they have a MASTER in Hea∣ven? or how can <HI>Parents</HI> train up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the LORD; if they do not lead them into the Fear and Worship of GOD from day to day? But indeed they wickedly neglect the <HI>private Means</HI> of their saving Illumination and effec∣tual Calling, Conversion and spiritual Edification. For surely, Parents and Heads of Families are <HI>the Ministers of</HI> GOD for this within their own Walls, and are to <HI>attend continually on this very thing.</HI></P>
<P>But does <HI>this</HI> seem to be so much as aim'd at, while <HI>Worship,</HI> the Means of Grace, is neglected in thy House? <HI>How knowest thou, O Man, but that thou may'st save</HI> thy Houshold, by the reverend Worship of GOD among them? Have you never heard of any that have dated their <HI>Conversion</HI> from such a <HI>Prayer</HI> in a Family? The excellent <HI>Lady</HI> ASHURST (of whose Piety and great Devotion I was once a Witness for many Weeks together) was an Instance of this Mer∣cy<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Fryday</HI> Evening Lectures in <HI>Eastcheap</HI> on the Duty of PRAYER. p. 303.</NOTE>. And thousands there are and thousands, both living and deceased, who are blessing GOD, and will bless Him for ever, that his Providence disposed of them into such Families of Religion. — On the o∣ther Hand, How knowest thou, O Man, but the want of Family Worship in thy House may turn to the loss and eternal perdition of thy Soul, and of the Souls of thy Houshold! And then, How will they and thy own inraged Conscience rise against thee in
<PB N="36" REF="003008_0037_0FEF95FF8C36F7E8"/>the Day of Judgment, and condemn thee? Which leads me to the <HI>third</HI> Motive,</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> For <HI>thy own sake,</HI> for the sake of thy <HI>own Soul;</HI> for thy Comfort and Peace in Life and Death, and for thy Safety in the Day of Judgment; main∣tain the Worship of GOD in thy Family. On thy doing thy Duty to GOD, and to thy Family, depends thy <HI>own</HI> eternal Salvation. If thou dost not consult the glorifying GOD in thy. House, and the Saving thy Houshold, thou destroyest thy own Soul.</P>
<P>You must <HI>watch</HI> for the Souls of your Family, as one that must give an <HI>Account</HI> for them to GOD: But what Account can you give of the Neglect of Family Worship, and therein of the Neglect of the Souls committed to thy Care? Will not GOD require them of thee another Day? And say to thee as in I. Kings xxvi. 39. <HI>Thy Soul shall go for</HI> these Souls if they perish: Or as it is in Ezek xvi. 20. <HI>Thou hast taken my Sons and my Daughters,</HI> and hast sacrificed them to Satan, to the World and thy Lusts. And thus you and yours may perish together.</P>
<P>Not that Family Worship will <HI>save</HI> a Man or his House; but it is a Means of Salvation that is by no means to be neglected. Nor that all must necessari∣ly <HI>perish,</HI> who are so unhappy as to live in prayer∣less Families; but the loss of eternal Salvation is en∣danger'd hereby. And if a prayerless Housholder, and some of his Houshold, perish hereby, his Con∣demnation will be the greater, because of his pro∣fane Ingratitude to GOD, and his unnatural Neglect of his Family. He shall be judged as a profane Wretch toward GOD, and an unnatural Father to his immortal Offspring, and <HI>a despiser of his own Soul and Ways.</HI> His Offspring and Servants will rise up in Judgment against him, and accuse him, that he never instructed them by Word and Example in the Worship and Fear of GOD, nor in the Care of their
<PB N="37" REF="003008_0038_0FEF9CFDB44E84A8"/>own Souls. And how will he ever look them in the face? and much less GOD who put them under his Care? His Guilt will fly in his face, and his own Heart rise and condemn him. The blood of <HI>Souls,</HI> even of his Wife and Children, may <HI>cry</HI> a∣gainst him from the Earth before he die, as the blood of <HI>Abel</HI>'s body did against wretched <HI>Cain.</HI> This punishment will be <HI>greater than he will be able to bear,</HI> nor will he be able to say, <HI>Was I their Keeper? Abel</HI>'s Soul was not destroyed with his Life; but ve∣rily a murder'd <HI>Soul</HI> (whether thy own or anothers) will be found a more horrid and hideous Guilt, than any meer murder of the Body, and to deserve eter∣nal Death.</P>
<P>And if the Guilt of prayerless Housholders may be found such in the Day of Judgment, what Pain and Terror may their Sin give them in the day of sore Affliction, or in the day of Death? Suppose this Man upon his <HI>Death-bed,</HI> and his Houshold gathering about him in that dark hour; how will he take <HI>leave</HI> of them whom he has never <HI>pray'd</HI> with? How will he do then to <HI>bless</HI> them, or they him? How shall his dying lips pray for them, as <HI>Jacob</HI> pour'd out Blessings on his Sons, sitting up in his Bed? O it must be a melancholly <HI>parting,</HI> from a Family that you have never pray'd with! Pray consider it, and let not another Evening or Morning pass without a Family Prayer For they or you may <HI>die</HI> before to Morrow: This Night may their or your Soul be required or called away: And can you think of dy∣ing and going into Eternity, without having pray'd together as a Family? How do you think to meet in <HI>Heaven,</HI> and live praising and blessing GOD together for ever and ever? Or how can you think of being cast together into <HI>Hell,</HI> &amp; for never blessing GOD toge∣ther in this Life, come to blaspheme him for ever, and curse one another eternally, in the World to come?</P>

But before Death comes, how miserable are such Families, such Relatives, in all their <HI>Afflictions?</HI> What Comfort can they find from one another under them, who have never been us'd to worship and pray together? What <HI>miserable Comforters</HI> are such like to be to each other? How can they pray for one another or speak of the Consolations of GOD to one another, in the days of their Trouble &amp; Distress?</P>
<P>On every Account therefore, present or future, <HI>for the sake of thy own Soul</HI> pray with thy Houshold dai∣ly; for thy happy and holy Living here, and for the eternal Well-being and Happiness (if it please GOD) both of thy <HI>Self</HI> and <HI>Family.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI> and lastly, The last <HI>Motive</HI> may be taken from our Duty to the <HI>Public,</HI> both in the <HI>State</HI> and in the <HI>Church.</HI> No Man is born for <HI>Himself</HI> alone, nor yet for his own <HI>House.</HI> We have our Nei'bours Good, the good of our <HI>Nei'bourhood,</HI> of the <HI>Place</HI> wherein we dwell, of the <HI>Country</HI> we belong to, and of the <HI>World</HI> wherein we sojourn, to act for. The Good of all <HI>these</HI> we may promote or hurt, by hav∣ing or not having the <HI>Worship of</HI> GOD upheld in our Families. Yea the Good is <HI>unknown,</HI> and so the Evil, that comes to the Public, by Peoples doing or not doing their Duty in their <HI>private</HI> Relations. Family Worship and Government make Places happy, and the want of it makes them miserable.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Good</HI> is unknown that the <HI>Public</HI> receives; unknown is the <HI>Benefit</HI> to a People both in Church and State, by the serious <HI>Worship</HI> of GOD in Families. There we may ordinarily suppose the best Family Watch and <HI>Government.</HI> The Housholder that re∣solves by GOD'S Grace <HI>to sing of Mercy and Judgment</HI> in his House, is most like to proceed and (like <HI>Da∣vid,</HI> Psalm ci.) <HI>walk within his House with a perfect Heart, setting no evil Work before his Eyes,</HI> nor suffer∣ing <HI>Pride</HI> or <HI>Frowardness</HI> to dwell with him, nor him
<PB N="39" REF="003008_0040_0FEF9D0343C88D38"/><HI>that telleth lies to tarry in his Sight.</HI> And it is from Families so taught and rul'd that the State, and Church is most like to be supplied with worthy Persons, from one Generation to another. Religious Families are the <HI>Nurseries</HI> for the <HI>Churches of</HI> CHRIST, to supply them with worthy Members and <HI>Communicants.</HI> These may be most look'd for from praying Houses. And it is happy for a People when the <HI>State</HI> also is sup∣plied with <HI>Judges</HI> and <HI>Counsellors</HI> from such Hous∣holds; who will be like to be <HI>Patrons</HI> of Religion and <HI>Examples</HI> of it in their Generation. Without THESE <HI>the Earth and all its Inhabitants dissolve,</HI> but these <HI>bear up the Pillars of it.</HI> Religion and Virtue, Piety and Devotion, Temperance and Honesty, Fru∣gality and Diligence, Justice and Righteousness, Hu∣mility and Charity, and every thing of good Report, are like to be propagated from such Families. And the <HI>Blessing of</HI> GOD, which makes a People prosper∣ous, is like to attend a Place for the sake of such Housholds. We may bless them in the Name of the LORD and say, <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>bless thee, O Habitation of Righteousness!</HI> As <HI>Godliness</HI> has the Promise of the Life that now is, so the <HI>Remains</HI> of it in a wicked World are very much owing to the Re∣ligion and Government and good Order of Families. There is the Rice and Foundation of Rule and Sub∣jection in the <HI>State,</HI> and so of the public Peace and Tranquility.</P>
<P N="2">2. Unknown is the <HI>Mischief</HI> and <HI>Woe</HI> to the World, to Church and State, from the <HI>Want</HI> of Family Wor∣ship and Government. The profaness and corruption that fills the Earth is very much owing to the Neg∣lect and ill Education of Children. It would be ve∣ry much more than it is, if there were not many re∣ligious Housholds, here and there. Family Worship is a mighty Restraint upon the Lusts of many, and prevents abundance of Sin. But where Family Re∣ligion
<PB N="40" REF="003008_0041_0FEF9D07167680E8"/>ceases, the <HI>fountains of the great Deep break</HI> open, and Wickedness comes on as a <HI>Flood.</HI> Surely <HI>the fear of</HI> GOD <HI>is not in that Place,</HI> and they live as <HI>without</HI> GOD <HI>and</HI> CHRIST <HI>in the World.</HI> Salvation, in the Means of it, is far from those Houses, and they count themselves unworthy of CHRIST'S coming un∣der their Roof. They say to the <HI>Almighty, depart from us;</HI> and Wo unto them if He depart from them.</P>
<P>Irreligion is propagated from such Houses, and their <HI>Posterity</HI> (that come of them) are like to be prayerless and graceless like their <HI>Ancestors.</HI> So they become a <HI>Curse</HI> to the World, and bring down the Wrath of GOD upon the Places where they live. As it is written, <HI>Pour out thy Fury upon the Heathen that know thee not, and upon the Families that call not up∣on thy Name.</HI> Wo to the World for this <HI>Offence</HI> a∣gainst GOD, which if it were <HI>universal</HI> would soon bring on the <HI>Violence</HI> that filled the Earth before the <HI>Flood,</HI> and the Corruption of <HI>Sodom</HI> after it; and so the Wrath and <HI>Vengeance</HI> of GOD to the uttermost; as it was in both <HI>those</HI> Cases.</P>
<P>If therefore we have any Regard to GOD, to our <HI>own Souls,</HI> to the Souls of our <HI>Housholds,</HI> and to the Good of the <HI>Places</HI> where we live; to the Weal of <HI>Mankind</HI> and to the Welfare of the <HI>Church of</HI> CHRIST; let us earnestly come into and be stedfast, immove∣able and abounding in this great and important Duty of <HI>Family Worship.</HI></P>
<P>Consider how much you owe it to GOD, to <HI>your Selves,</HI> to your <HI>Families,</HI> and to the <HI>World.</HI> Let the Love of GOD, and of your <HI>Nei'bour,</HI> of your <HI>Hous∣holds,</HI> and of your <HI>own Souls,</HI> constrain you to this necessary and reasonable Service: Wherein the <HI>Ho∣nour</HI> of GOD, the temporal and spiritual <HI>Advantage</HI> of those that are <HI>your own Bowels,</HI> and your good <HI>Account</HI> in the Day of CHRIST, as well as the Good of your <HI>Country</HI> &amp; <HI>Posterity,</HI> are all so nearly interested.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="003008_0042_0FEF9D0998625328"/>
How can you say that you love, honour or fear GOD if you do not worship Him in your Housholds? Or how can you say that you love your <HI>Families,</HI> while you neglect this? At least, How can you say that you love and care for their precious &amp; immortal <HI>Souls,</HI> which should have your first Love &amp; chief Care?</P>
<P>But let those that are found in this religious Course and Practice be greatly encouraged and confirmed in it, by what has been said. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>increase You more and more, You and your Children. This is the Generation of them that seek Him; that seek thy Face, O</HI> GOD <HI>of Jacob!</HI> This <HI>godly Seed</HI> the LORD <HI>seeks;</HI> He seeks, and forms and finds them in <HI>this</HI> Way. The LORD <HI>loves</HI> these <HI>Dwellings of Jacob,</HI> loves to dwell in them. These are his <HI>Bethels,</HI> Houses of <HI>Prayer.</HI> As the <HI>Ark</HI> in the house of <HI>Obed-edom</HI> bro't down the Blessing of GOD on it, so let the <HI>Worship of</HI> GOD in thy House do on thee and thine. <HI>The</HI> LORD <HI>bless thee and keep thee, make thee fruitful and multiply thee.</HI> GOD has given you <HI>the Heritage of those that fear his Name;</HI> the LORD <HI>is your In∣heritance.</HI> Your Houses shall be called <HI>his Houses of Prayer, among all People.</HI> The Churches of CHRIST and his Ministers <HI>salute you much in the</HI> LORD. The LORD, <HI>the Keeper of Israel</HI> watch over your <HI>sprinkled</HI> Houses; for <HI>the bunch of Hyssop</HI> with the <HI>atoning Blood</HI> on it hangs at your door: May he ever cleanse and water you with the heavenly Influences of his SPIRIT and Grace! And may <HI>the Voice of Re∣joicing and Salvation</HI> be ever with you, <HI>as in the Ta∣bernacles of the Righteous..</HI></P>
<P>We <HI>thank</HI> GOD that there are so many <HI>praying Fa∣milies</HI> in the <HI>Town,</HI> and thro' the <HI>Land;</HI> and so ma∣ny Families of <HI>Distinction</HI> among us that are Exem∣plary for this Duty. We are sorry that there are any, so many Houses, in the <HI>Town,</HI> or in any part of the <HI>Land,</HI> where GOD is not daily worship'd. If
<PB N="42" REF="003008_0043_0FEF9D0DA7ED1990"/>there were not a prayerless Houshold known among us, this would be our Glory and Safety.</P>
<P>Yet to Those that keep up the solemn Worship of GOD in their Houses, let me say, — <HI>Rest not</HI> in such a Course of holy Duty <HI>as your Righteousness;</HI> that be far from you. Neither look on the Person or Family of thy prayerless Nei'bour with any Eye of spiritual <HI>Pride,</HI> as if thou wert <HI>holier</HI> than he or his; but walk humbly with GOD and lowly before Men. <HI>Live</HI> every day agreeably to thy Family De∣votions, and <HI>daily perform thy Vows. Be thou in the Fear of the</HI> LORD <HI>all the day long;</HI> that <HI>thy Prayers may not become Sin,</HI> and be cast back <HI>as dung in thy Face.</HI> — Walk daily with GOD in <HI>Secret:</HI> It may be some pray with their Families, who do not pray in their <HI>Closets:</HI> But GOD has strictly requir'd secret and <HI>retir'd</HI> Prayer, by our selves alone. — Neither content thy Self with <HI>secret</HI> and <HI>family</HI> Worship, but walk thou and thy House <HI>in all the Commandments and Ordinances of the</HI> LORD <HI>blameless,</HI> in all his Insti∣tuted public Worship. <HI>For the</HI> LORD <HI>loveth the Gates of Zion more than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Dwellings of Jacob.</HI> He loves the Worship of the Houshold <HI>well,</HI> but that of his Temple <HI>more.</HI> — <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> an especial manner let the <HI>Sab∣baths</HI> of the LORD be sanctified in thy Dwelling, by the Word of God and Prayer. — And finally, To Worship add <HI>Family Instruction and Government.</HI> When you have <HI>pray'd</HI> with your Houshold, then <HI>watch over them in the</HI> LORD. So be unto CHRIST a <HI>King,</HI> as well as a <HI>Priest,</HI> in thy House: to <HI>rule</HI> for Him, as well as to offer up <HI>Spiritual Sacrifices.</HI></P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX. From the <HI>Whole Duty of Man:</HI> CHAP. V. SECT. xii.</HEAD>
<P>A Second sort of <HI>public Prayer</HI> is that in a <HI>Family,</HI> where all that are <HI>Members</HI> of it joyn in their common Supplications: And this ought to be very carefully attended to, first by the <HI>Master</HI> of the Family, who is to look that there be <HI>such</HI> Prayers; it being as much his part to provide for the <HI>Souls</HI> of his Chil∣dren and Servants, as to provide <HI>food</HI> for their Bo∣dies. Therefore there is none, even the meanest Housholder, but ought to take this care. — What choice soever they make of <HI>Prayers</HI> let them be sure to have some; and let no Man that professeth him∣self to be a <HI>Christian</HI> keep so <HI>heathenish</HI> a Family, as not to see GOD be daily worshiped in it. But when the Master of the Family hath done his Duty in this providing, it is the duty of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Member</HI> of it to make use of that Provision, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> constant and diligent at those FAMILY PRAYERS.</P>
