<HEAD>To the READER:</HEAD>
<P>I Desire to premise a few things con∣cerning the following <HI>Dialogues,</HI> and the Occasion of their Publication. As to the <HI>Dialogues</HI> themselves they con∣tain a rich and precious store of spiritual Knowledge and godly Comfort. They speak to the Hearts of Men in a very easie and familiar manner, so that the meanest <HI>Plough-man,</HI> the very meanest of God's People may understand them. They treat of that deep but comfortable Doctrin, (that <HI>Soul-pierceing</HI> Doctrin to the wicked and unregenerate, but <HI>Soul-refreshing</HI> and <HI>Heart-comforting</HI> Doctrin to the Saints, to all righteous and godly Folk;) I mean the Doctrin of <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Predestination.</HI></P>
<P>And now as to the Occasion of the Pub∣lication of these <HI>Dialogues.</HI> Alas <HI>Christians!</HI> I fear there is too, too great Occasion for them. The many pernicious (and I fear (Alas!) <HI>Soul-destroying</HI>) Books that have been handed up and down in the <HI>Country</HI> as well as <HI>City,</HI> to poison and debauch Men's
<PB N="ii" REF="002100_0003_0FBB815FCA1AF5B8"/>
Minds, call aloud for these <HI>Dialogues</HI> (or other such like Discourses) to rectifie Men's Opinions in these Matters. There have been many wicked Books written (by the instigation of the <HI>Old Serpent</HI> who goes about to deceive) which put false Com∣ments, &amp; horrid <HI>Anti-christian</HI> Glosses upon <HI>the best of Books,</HI> the Fountain of all true and divine Wisdom, I mean our holy and <HI>precious Bible.</HI> These <HI>Dialogues</HI> will rightly instruct Men concerning the true <HI>Scrip∣ture Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Predestination.</HI> These, these plain but <HI>Heart-enlightening Dialogues</HI> will shew Thee (<HI>Christian Reader</HI>) what was the Opinion of the holy <HI>Martyrs</HI> of the Church in the first and purest Ages of <HI>Christianity</HI> concerning these Doctrines; &amp; oh! I am sure we ought to follow them, them I say who were taught the <HI>Faith</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> from the Mouthes of the <HI>Apostles</HI> or <HI>apostolick</HI> Men, and dyed glorious <HI>Martyrs</HI> to the Truth: I say we ought to mind what these say, rather than harken to the delus∣ions of the <HI>great Whore,</HI> the <HI>Scarlet Whore,</HI> the <HI>Whore</HI> of <HI>Babylon,</HI> that great <HI>Anti-Christ,</HI> &amp; others who in later Ages have new-vampt her wicked and <HI>Soul-murthering</HI> Maxims, and have sent them abroad to bewitch the Na∣tions. Oh <HI>Christians! Fellow-Christians</HI> and
<PB N="iii" REF="002100_0004_0FBB8161C6FD8530"/>
<HI>Protestants!</HI> These are direful Things, ah, these are <HI>Heart-afflicting Matters!</HI> that we shou'd ever hear of them in a <HI>Land</HI> of <HI>Light!</HI> No, let us not follow these <HI>blind Guides;</HI> who (if we do) will certainly lead us into the Ditch, but as I said before, let us follow the Example of the <HI>primitive Church,</HI> and give Ear to those <HI>pious</HI> and <HI>godly Fathers</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> who will teach us the Truth in Sincerity. Here I cannot but take notice of the sad and deplorable Degeneracy of Mankind, who are grown (many of them) to that Height of <HI>malicious scorning</HI> of others who happen (tho' <HI>conscientiously</HI>) to dissent from them, that they will neither read the Books publish'd by such Men, <HI>nor suffer others to read them, if they can help it:</HI> This, this is an <HI>unchristian-like Practice.</HI> This is so unlike the <HI>kind Dealing</HI> which <HI>Christiani∣ty</HI> always makes use of, and so like the hor∣rid Practice of the <HI>Synagogue</HI> of <HI>Rome,</HI> that we <HI>Christians</HI> ought to abhor it. For the <HI>Papishes</HI> will Suffer no Books of the <HI>Protest∣ants</HI> (whom they call <HI>Hereticks</HI>) <HI>to be Print∣ed in their Countries,</HI> neither will they suffer their <HI>Disciples</HI> (or rather <HI>Slaves) to read them:</HI> I say <HI>Slaves,</HI> because those <HI>Masters</HI> who will not suffer their <HI>Proselytes</HI> to make En∣quiry whether the Doctrines they teach
<PB N="iv" REF="002100_0005_0FBB8162B7C6DEA0"/>
them be true or false, They I say, whom they thus teach, are so far from being <HI>Dis∣ciples,</HI> that they are <HI>mean,</HI> they are <HI>servile</HI> &amp; <HI>abject Slaves;</HI> and utterly <HI>un-like</HI> the <HI>ratio∣nal Bereans,</HI> who are called <HI>noble</HI> in <HI>Scripture, for examining whether those Things were so or not.</HI> The <HI>Scripture</HI> bids us examine <HI>all Things,</HI> and hold fast that which is <HI>best.</HI> But the Meaning of this Exhortation is not, that we shou'd be <HI>for ever reading, reading</HI> all Books that are publish'd, for indeed many of them <HI>are not worth the Reading.</HI> Indeed I have hear'd People say that there is scarce one in twenty of the Books written by <HI>Dissenters</HI> that have <HI>common sence</HI> in them. Whether this be true or not, <HI>let the World iudge.</HI> But if it be true, <HI>I hope they will take more heed for the future.</HI> But be it true or not true, this I am sure is a true saying <HI>viz. Wisdom is <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Children.</HI> I must say one Word more concerning this Matter, (by way of Apology for their <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Notions</HI> (that if the Writings of the <HI>Noncon∣formists</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> be not quite so <HI>Polite</HI> as the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> some others, it may be, <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Writing so much;</HI> for when Men write Books <HI>faster than People can</HI> read them, their Method of reasoning too <HI>being perfectly <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>,</HI> and their Motion be∣ing
<PB N="v" REF="002100_0006_0FBB816449449AB8"/>
so <HI>exceeding quick, (Po<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r Men!</HI>) they can't help being <HI>a little giddy.</HI> But their is another Reason, and a charitable one too. There is a vast Deal of Paper made in that <HI>most christian Country</HI> (in some Men's Esteem) <HI>Holland,</HI> so much, that they scarce know what to do with it all; and some Men think it an Act of Charity, not to let any Thingly upon the Hands of our good <HI>Allies,</HI> and <HI>true Protestant Brethren</HI> the <HI>Dutch.</HI> There∣fore their Charity, with their <HI>Lust after Writing,</HI> forces them to buy it up, and then cramm it full of <HI>painfull</HI> and <HI>Laborious Searches</HI> and <HI>Re-searches</HI> after the <HI>Truth,</HI> and in <HI>Soul-Cherishing</HI> and <HI>Heart-helping Works</HI> of <HI>Edifi∣cation, Recumbency</HI> and <HI>Regeneration, Mis∣terious Tractates all!</HI> If what has been said concerning the Writings of <HI>Dissenters</HI> be true, (as some Men say they can make it appear) I hope the <HI>rising Generation</HI> will mend the Matter. And to let Thee see what Hopes thou may'st have of their so doing; I will give Thee some Account of the Parts of some of the <HI>Rising Generation,</HI> who tho' (it must be confest) they are but <HI>Striplings</HI>) yet they are (some of them) <HI>wonderful, wonderful Striplings!</HI> It has been remark'd by some of their <HI>Hearers,</HI> that (<HI>oh dear!) they can say what they please; that
<PB N="vi" REF="002100_0007_0FBB8165B9669868"/>
even in publick Prayer to God they can say even what they please;</HI> (and there are some People who think indeed that <HI>they do say what they please</HI>) there be others who can <HI>preach</HI> a long <HI>Sermon</HI> without using any <HI>Notes,</HI> nay and <HI>preach</HI> three such <HI>Sermons</HI> in one Day. There be others in this <HI>Country</HI> likewise, (but from whence they came, or how they came hither we know not; but no Matter for that, we have them, &amp; <HI>able Men they are</HI>) there be <HI>others</HI> who I say are very extraordi∣nary; whose Zeal for <HI>Preaching</HI> (if we may believe common Fame) was so great, that they (poor Hearts half starv'd) left their <HI>dear Country,</HI> and <HI>all that they had in the World,</HI> (that is their Packs) to come into <HI>Foreign Parts</HI> to <HI>Preach.</HI> But there are some (to their Praise be it spoken) who are of an higher <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Abilities</HI> than these; concerning one <HI>of whom,</HI> one of the <HI>Rising Generation,</HI> there has been lately pro∣nounc'd, by a <HI>celebrated Writer,</HI> a very ex∣traordinary Speech, so extraordinary, that I beg leave to transcribe part of it, (the <HI>Quintessence</HI>) it is this, <HI>viz.</HI> <Q><HI>Highly favoured of God,</HI> are the <HI>Churches</HI> enriched with <HI>Pastors</HI> of bright <HI>Abilities,</HI> for the build∣ing and serving of his <HI>Temple: Able</HI> to understand the <HI>Sacred Oracles</HI> even in the
<PB N="vi" REF="002100_0008_0FBB8167701789E8"/>
<HI>Languages</HI> wherein they are given us, and illustrate them from an intimate Ac∣quaintance with <HI>Antiquity:—Able</HI> to maintain the Truth with <HI>Armour</HI> fetch'd from the <HI>Tower</HI> of <HI>David,</HI> and convince or confound <HI>Gainsayers,</HI> that go to perplex us with their <HI>Controversies:</HI></Q> — Here (I be∣seech ye) let me advise <HI>Gainsayers</HI> to take heed how they oppose them, for here's no∣thing but <HI>convince</HI> or <HI>Confound,</HI> stand clear, for here's no Quarter to be given. If any thing should be objected against the follow∣ing Papers, (as I expect there will, for there are many who call themselves <HI>Church of England-Men,</HI> who won't like what these Papers contain) I say if any Thing shou'd be said against the Doctrins laid down herein, it is expected that some of these <HI>Gentlemen</HI> (who are so able to <HI>convince</HI> or <HI>Confound</HI>) will let the world know, whether what the following Pages contain is the <HI>true Scripture Doctrine</HI> of these Matters or not. And in∣deed I will help the <HI>Gentlemen</HI> (because they are young) to an unanswerable Argument, and such as the meanest plough-man may apprehend; and 'tis this, <HI>viz.</HI> (if any Man in answer to these Papers, shou'd argue up∣on their old <HI>Hypothesis</HI> of <HI>Secret Decrees</HI>) I would have them make use of this Argu∣ment;
<PB N="viii" REF="002100_0009_0FBB816ACADBD0D0"/>
<HI>That two absolute Contradictions canno both be true, but the Will of the true God re∣veal'd to us in holy Scripture is an absolute Con∣tradiction to those stoical and fatal Schemes; Therefore it is impossible that those Schemes can be true.</HI> The <HI>Minor</HI> is prov'd to a De∣monstration in the following Sheets.</P>
<P>Before I conclude this <HI>Preface,</HI> I beg leave to give a little Advice to those Persons into whose hands these Papers may fall, that they wou'd not, if they happen to find any Thing <HI>displeasing to them,</HI> immediately throw them out of their Hands; it may be they may take Offence without Reason; but I entreat them to read them quite thro', lest they be guilty of <HI>Injustice,</HI> by giving Sentence <HI>before the Trial of the Matter.</HI> I conclude with an hearty Desire that these Papers may be at∣tentively read over, <HI>and for this Reason,</HI> because they will rightly instruct Thee con∣cerning some of those Things in <HI>Paul's</HI> Epis∣tles▪ which <HI>Peter</HI> says are hard to be under∣stood, which they that are unlearned &amp; unsta∣ble wrest, as <HI>they</HI> do also the other Scriptures unto their own Destruction. <HI>Ye therefore, belo∣ved, seeing ye know</HI> these Things <HI>before, beware lest ye also being led away with the Error of the wicked, fall from your own Stedfastness. But grow in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ: To whom <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> both now and forever.</HI> Amen.</P>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have heard that some Men, par∣ticularly one Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> has been endea∣vouring to bring into our <HI>excellent</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the <HI>Scotch</HI> and <HI>Dutch Presbyterian</HI> Notions concerning <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Predestination.</HI> Now Sir, if I have been rightly inform'd concern¦ing these <HI>rigid Doctrines,</HI> I shou'd be very sorry they shou'd take place any further in the Minds of Men; because they will take
<PB N="2" REF="002100_0011_0FBB816E0466D0D8"/>
away our <HI>Free-will,</HI> and transform us into something worse than <HI>Brutes,</HI> for the <HI>Brutes</HI> plainly discover a Freedom of <HI>Election</HI> in their <HI>Actions.</HI> They will make <HI>God</HI> the <HI>Author</HI> of <HI>Sin.</HI> And his Punishment of the wicked to be meerly <HI>arbitrary,</HI> to condemn Men to eternal <HI>Flames,</HI> for those <HI>Sins</HI> which he had put out of their <HI>Power</HI> to <HI>avoid!</HI> Nay to <HI>create</HI> them on <HI>purpose</HI> to make them thus <HI>miserable!</HI> the repeating of it <HI>frights</HI> me! It seems all <HI>Blasphemy</HI> to me; to represent the infinit <HI>Goodness</HI> and <HI>Father</HI> of <HI>Mercies,</HI> in the Colours of <HI>Cruelty</HI> it self, that you cou'd not exceed it in the Description of the <HI>Devil!</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Therefore the <HI>Lutherans</HI> have charg'd the <HI>Calvinists</HI> with Worshipping the <HI>Devil.</HI> For, say they, we see not the <HI>Person</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> or of the <HI>Devil.</HI> Therefore we describe them by their <HI>Qualities.</HI> And if we make <HI>God</HI> more cruel than the <HI>Devil,</HI> we make Him worse than the <HI>Devil.</HI> And we Wor∣ship the <HI>Devil</HI> under the Name of <HI>God.</HI> For it is not the Word GOD that we <HI>Wor∣ship,</HI> but what we <HI>mean</HI> by it. The Hea∣thens did <HI>Sacrifice</HI> to <HI>Devils,</HI> &amp; not to <HI>God,</HI> yet they call'd those <HI>Devils</HI> by the Name of <HI>Gods.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>But <HI>God</HI> is call'd a <HI>Consuming Fire,</HI> and a <HI>terrible God.</HI> Is there not something of <HI>Cruelty</HI> in this?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="002100_0012_0FBB816F791FAC28"/>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>You easily apprehend the Difference betwixt <HI>Justice</HI> and <HI>Cruelty. God</HI> is <HI>Justice,</HI> but ther is nothing of <HI>Cruelty</HI> in his Na∣ture. <HI>Cruelty</HI> is delighting in the Misery of another, without any regard to a Fault committed. As Envy is repining at the <HI>Prosperity</HI> of another, let him deserve it ne∣ver so well; for an <HI>envious</HI> Man cannot en∣dure to see any other in a better Conditi∣on than Himself. But none of these can be in <HI>God.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now I understand. <HI>God</HI> punishes in <HI>Justice,</HI> as He is the Supream <HI>Judge</HI> of the World. But if He made <HI>Creatures</HI> on pur∣pose to <HI>damn</HI> them, this has all the Notion we can have of <HI>Cruelty.</HI> And if He put it out of their Power not to <HI>sin,</HI> and left them no <HI>Free-will</HI> to <HI>chuse</HI> whether they would <HI>sin</HI> or not, see not how this can be recon∣cil'd to <HI>Justice.</HI> Therefor I think no Crea∣ture is capable of <HI>sinning</HI> but what has <HI>free-will. Sin</HI> being the <HI>Inclining</HI> of the <HI>Will</HI> to <HI>Evil,</HI> and not to <HI>Good.</HI> Which if I have no Power to do, I can neither do <HI>Good</HI> nor <HI>Evil.</HI> I have no Title to <HI>Reward,</HI> nor am I lyable to <HI>Punishment.</HI> And what a <HI>Jest</HI> wou'd it be in you, if you shou'd pretend to <HI>argue</HI> with me, to <HI>promise</HI> or <HI>threaten,</HI> to perswade me to do such a Thing, if you
<PB N="4" REF="002100_0013_0FBB817105FDD040"/>
knew before-hand that it was <HI>impossible</HI> for me to do it? Suppose you shou'd tye me Hand &amp; Foot, throw me into a <HI>Prison, bolt</HI> and <HI>fetter</HI> me down to the Floor, lock the Doors fast upon me, and then <HI>set-fire</HI> to it,—then <HI>preach</HI> to me in at the Window, and use most <HI>pathetical</HI> Exhortations to me to come out, and why wou'd I stay there to be <HI>burn'd?</HI> And shou'd <HI>Swear</HI> to me, <HI>as I live I don't desire your Death, nor have any Pleasure in it;</HI> and shou'd <HI>promise</HI> me great <HI>Rewards</HI> if I wou'd come out; wou'd not this be <HI>insulting</HI> my <HI>Misery,</HI> and the great∣est Aggravation of <HI>Cruelty</HI> that is possible to be imagin'd? Yet this is the <HI>Notion</HI> those rigid <HI>Calvinists</HI> wou'd have us entertain of the <HI>Goodness</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> of all his gracious <HI>Pro∣mises,</HI> and of his <HI>Threatnings</HI> to us, if we forsake not our <HI>Iniquities,</HI> and deliver our selves out of that <HI>Prison</HI> and <HI>Bondage</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> into which we had cast our selves, by our habitual wicked Courses. This is the Case, as they put it. And I have made it easie to my self to apprehend it, by this familiar Example I have given, that I see it before my Eyes, and <HI>detest</HI> and <HI>abhor</HI> it! But still I have a Question to ask upon this Point. We say in the <HI>Collect</HI> for the <HI>Second Sunday</HI> in <HI>Lent,</HI> That <HI>we have no power of our selves
<PB N="5" REF="002100_0014_0FBB81742A68F2E8"/>
to help our selves.</HI> Is not this the Case I put of the <HI>Prison?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, fully. If we consider our <HI>Help</HI> as only from <HI>our selves.</HI> When Man had fal∣len by his <HI>Rebellion</HI> against <HI>God;</HI> he was no ways able to deliver himself either from the <HI>Dominion</HI> of <HI>Sin,</HI> or from the <HI>Prison</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> to which it was <HI>doom'd.</HI> But <HI>Christ</HI> our blessed <HI>Saviour</HI> enter'd into that <HI>Prison</HI> in our <HI>Nature,</HI> and in our <HI>Stead,</HI> and made full <HI>Satisfaction</HI> for all the <HI>Sins</HI> of that <HI>Na∣ture,</HI> to be apply'd to all who laid hold up∣on it, by a <HI>true</HI> and <HI>lively Faith,</HI> and a sincere <HI>Repentance</HI> for their <HI>Sins.</HI> He open'd the <HI>Prison-Doors,</HI> and preach'd Deliverance to all who wou'd accept of his <HI>Salvation.</HI> And to those who are <HI>willing,</HI> he gives the As∣sistance of his <HI>Grace,</HI> to help their <HI>Infir∣mities.</HI> And this is necessary to all the Actions of our Life. Without this, we can neither do a good <HI>Deed,</HI> nor think a good <HI>Thought.</HI> So that all the <HI>Glory</HI> is still to <HI>Him.</HI> Yet <HI>something</HI> is still lest for <HI>us</HI> to do. We must <HI>work</HI> with <HI>Him,</HI> because He <HI>works</HI> in <HI>us</HI> both to <HI>will,</HI> and to <HI>do.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Thus then I take it. If I <HI>manure</HI> my Ground never so well, yet without the <HI>Sun</HI> it will not bear. On the other
<PB N="6" REF="002100_0015_0FBB817595971598"/>
Hand, if I do not <HI>prepare</HI> my Ground, the <HI>Sun</HI> will not bring a <HI>Crop</HI> I did not <HI>sow.</HI> Nay it is the <HI>Sun</HI> too which, with my <HI>Labour,</HI> do's prepare the Ground, and <HI>fit</HI> it to receive the <HI>Seed.</HI> So that in Effect all is from the <HI>Sun,</HI> both to prepare the <HI>Earth,</HI> and enable it to bring forth the <HI>Seed.</HI> Yet our <HI>Labour</HI> is ne∣cessary, not as what <HI>produces</HI> any Thing, but only to <HI>remove</HI> what hinders the <HI>Production.</HI> Now I compare the <HI>Sun</HI> to the <HI>Grace</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> without which we can do nothing. And our <HI>Working,</HI> tho' it can <HI>produce</HI> nothing of it self, yet it prepares the <HI>Heart</HI> to receive the <HI>Influence</HI> of the <HI>Sun</HI> of <HI>Righteousness.</HI> So that, as St. <HI>Paul</HI> saith, he that <HI>planteth</HI> is no∣thing, nor he that <HI>watereth,</HI> but <HI>God</HI> who giveth the Encrease.

<P>I have been attack'd, Sir, for the last words, I spoke last Time, saying that the <HI>Predestinarians</HI> did <HI>banter</HI> and <HI>blaspheme</HI> the great <HI>God.</HI> They say that <HI>Predestination</HI> is a <HI>Scripture-word,</HI> and therefore no Man ought to speak against it. And I must have some of your Help to rid me out of this; for I wou'd by no Means say any Thing to the Derogation of the <HI>holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>The <HI>holy Scriptures</HI> often speak to
<PB N="8" REF="002100_0017_0FBB8179B68B39F0"/>
us, <HI>after the Manner of Men,</HI> which in the <HI>Schools</HI> is call'd, <HI>ad Captum,</HI> that is to our <HI>Capacities.</HI> For otherwise we cou'd not <HI>un∣derstand</HI> them. We have no words that can <HI>properly</HI> express the <HI>infinit Nature</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> He is <HI>eternal</HI> and dwells in <HI>Eternity,</HI> but we have no words but of <HI>Time.</HI> We cannot conceive a <HI>Duration</HI> without <HI>past, present,</HI> and <HI>to come,</HI> yet these cannot be in <HI>God.</HI> For then He must have a <HI>Beginning,</HI> and wou'd <HI>gain</HI> or <HI>lose</HI> in Process of Time, as we do. All Things are <HI>present</HI> to Him. Therefor wherever <HI>Fore</HI> or <HI>After</HI> is attri∣buted to <HI>God</HI> in <HI>holy Scripture,</HI> we must take that Word <HI>ad Captum,</HI> because ther is no <HI>Fore</HI> or <HI>After</HI> in <HI>God.</HI> Such is the Word <HI>Pre-Destination,</HI> or <HI>Fore-Ordaining,</HI> or <HI>Fore-Knowing.</HI> God <HI>knows</HI> all Things. But He <HI>fore-knows</HI> nothing, because all Things are <HI>Present</HI> to Him. So He <HI>ordains,</HI> but He do's not <HI>fore-ordain.</HI> Yet we must use these Words, because they are according to our <HI>Capacities.</HI> But if we argue <HI>strictly</HI> and <HI>properly</HI> from them, we shall fall not only into many <HI>Absurdities,</HI> but even <HI>Blasphemies.</HI> And so it is as to other Words <HI>ad Captum. God</HI> is said in <HI>Scripture</HI> to <HI>repent,</HI> to be <HI>grie∣ved,</HI> to be <HI>angry,</HI> &amp;c. Yet we all know <HI>God</HI> is not subiect to any of these <HI>Passions.</HI> And
<PB N="9" REF="002100_0018_0FBB817AE2CC5728"/>
if we should <HI>argue strictly</HI> and <HI>properly</HI> from such Expressions, we must deny the <HI>Being</HI> of a <HI>God,</HI> for such <HI>Passions</HI> are totally <HI>incon∣sistent</HI> with the <HI>Being</HI> of a <HI>God.</HI> Now if I shou'd argue from God's being said to <HI>re∣pent,</HI> that He is <HI>changeable,</HI> and 20 other Consequences might be drawn from thence, What wou'd Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> say to me? Wou'd He not tell me, that I was <HI>totally</HI> out of the Way, and ought not to draw a∣ny such Consequences from a Word that was only <HI>ad Captum.</HI> The same I say to Him as to <HI>Predestination,</HI> which is only <HI>ad Captum,</HI> and no more a <HI>Scripture-Word,</HI> than God's <HI>repenting,</HI> &amp;c. And if He will not give me leave to draw <HI>Consequences</HI> from the <HI>one,</HI> neither will I give him leave to draw <HI>Consequences</HI> from the <HI>other,</HI> both being equally <HI>absurd.</HI> And let Him shew me a reason more for the <HI>one</HI> than the <HI>other,</HI> if He can. Now these Words <HI>ad Captum</HI> are to be understood <HI>comparatively,</HI> with an <HI>as if.</HI> Thus when it is said <HI>God repented</HI> He had made Man, and it <HI>grieved</HI> Him at the <HI>Heart,</HI> it is to express the high <HI>Displeasure</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> and the terrible <HI>Punishment</HI> of the <HI>Flood</HI> that follow'd, AS IF God had <HI>repented,</HI> &amp; been <HI>grieved</HI> at the <HI>Heart, &amp;c.</HI> And thus when God was willing to express the ex∣ceeding
<PB N="10" REF="002100_0019_0FBB817C575A2640"/>
<HI>Greatness</HI> of his <HI>Love</HI> to us, and the full <HI>Assurance</HI> we may have in his <HI>Promises,</HI> He do's it with an <HI>as if</HI> ther were a <HI>Yester∣day</HI> in <HI>God,</HI> and that He had then chosen us by Name, and past an <HI>ir-reversible Decree</HI> for our <HI>Salvation,</HI> which no <HI>Time</HI> or <HI>Accident</HI> shou'd ever alter. In which <HI>Scripture-sense,</HI> of <HI>Predestination</HI> it is a Doctrin full of <HI>Comfort</HI> and <HI>Assurance</HI> to all good <HI>Christians.</HI> And ther is nothing hard to be understood in it. But the <HI>Perplexities</HI> of this Dispute have a∣risen from taking the Word in the <HI>strict</HI> and <HI>literal</HI> Sense, without any <HI>as if,</HI> or <HI>Comparison</HI> in the Case, or any <HI>Allowance</HI> for a Word <HI>ad Captum:</HI> But down-right suppo∣sing a Time <HI>past</HI> in <HI>God,</HI> and the <HI>Decree</HI> al∣ready <HI>past,</HI> concerning Things <HI>to Come</HI> with <HI>God.</HI> Which <HI>Absurdity</HI> being granted, o∣thers follow <HI>in-extricable</HI> on both sides. For Example, such <HI>Decree</HI> being suppos'd to be <HI>past,</HI> it takes away <HI>Free-will;</HI> else the <HI>Will</HI> of <HI>Man</HI> might disappoint the <HI>Decree</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> On the other Hand, without <HI>Free-will</HI> sup∣pos'd, it will be impossible to give an Ac∣count for all the <HI>Promises</HI> and <HI>Threatnings</HI> in the <HI>Holy Scriptures,</HI> and the <HI>Protestations</HI> of God that he delighteth not in the <HI>Death</HI> of a <HI>Sinner,</HI> and his earnest <HI>Invitations</HI> to <HI>Repentance.</HI> And as this is the <HI>Perplexity</HI> of
<PB N="11" REF="002100_0020_0FBB817DB70F65E0"/>
the Dispute, so remove the first <HI>Absurdity,</HI> and all clears up on both sides. Let us understand God's <HI>Predestination</HI> (as his <HI>re∣penting</HI>) to be a Word <HI>ad Captum,</HI> not to be <HI>strictly</HI> and <HI>Philosophically</HI> inquir'd into, and Consequences drawn from it; but to look to the general <HI>Import</HI> and <HI>Meaning</HI> of it, &amp; there we understand the Firmness of God's <HI>Promises,</HI> and of his <HI>Covenant</HI> made with us in <HI>Christ,</HI> impossible to be frustrated, <HI>AS IF</HI> decreed in <HI>Time past,</HI> even from <HI>Eterni∣ty.</HI> But the <HI>Decree</HI> of <HI>God</HI> being only <HI>Pre∣sent,</HI> for that ther is no <HI>past</HI> or <HI>future</HI> in Him, we take the Expression only <HI>ad Captum,</HI> and see no <HI>future Infraction</HI> upon our <HI>Free-will</HI> from the <HI>Pre-Destination</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> The whole Difficulty being as to Time of <HI>'fore</HI> and <HI>after,</HI> which we are sure <HI>are</HI> not, nor <HI>can</HI> be in God.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I understand. And if others wou'd take notice of what you have said, it would stop our arguing and wrangling a∣bout it, while it is plain we set out upon a wrong Foundation, in applying <HI>past</HI> and <HI>future</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> which is only as to us. And it is of <HI>God only</HI> we speak, when we speak of his eternal <HI>Decrees</HI> before <HI>Man</HI> was made. For <HI>Man</HI> was not then in the Case, other∣wise than as all <HI>future</HI> Things are <HI>present</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="002100_0021_0FBB8181B74DE5E0"/>
with <HI>God.</HI> But if we will apply this to our∣selves, then it will follow, that I was <HI>born</HI> before I was <HI>born,</HI> even from <HI>Eternity,</HI> be∣cause my <HI>Birth</HI> was then <HI>present</HI> with <HI>God.</HI> And my <HI>Death</HI> is now <HI>present</HI> with <HI>Him,</HI> therefor I am now <HI>Dead!</HI> And when I am <HI>dead,</HI> I am not <HI>dead,</HI> because all live to Him! Thus we apply to our selves what we call his <HI>Fore-Decrees,</HI> and say that the <HI>Freedom</HI> of our <HI>Will</HI> is now ty'd up by them. Therefor let me make this Experiment. Let us leave the Word <HI>Fore</HI> out of the Dispute, and say only, that God <HI>ordains</HI> the <HI>Punishment</HI> of <HI>Wickedness,</HI> and the <HI>Reward</HI> of <HI>Vertue;</HI> and ther is no <HI>Difficulty</HI> at all in this. But when we say (in the rigid <HI>Cal∣vinistical</HI> Sense) that <HI>God Fore-ordains,</HI> there comes in all the Confusion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>And Dr. <HI>Edwards,</HI> or any <HI>Predesti∣narian</HI> cannot refuse this, since they all al∣low that ther is no <HI>Fore</HI> or <HI>After</HI> in <HI>God.</HI> Therefor if they will speak <HI>properly</HI> of Him, they must use Words <HI>only</HI> of the <HI>present.</HI> And will they perplex the World, and make Men run <HI>mad,</HI> only because they will not speak <HI>properly</HI> of God? If they pretend to argue <HI>Philosophically,</HI> and draw just <HI>Conse∣quences,</HI> they must use proper Words, &amp; not dispute from Words that are <HI>only ad Captum.</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>The Account you gave me last Time, Sir, of <HI>Predestination</HI> has satisfy'd me, that in the <HI>Scripture-sense</HI> of the Word, and ta∣ken only <HI>ad Captum,</HI> as you express it, it is a most <HI>comfortable Doctrin,</HI> and full of Assu∣rance to all good <HI>Christians.</HI> But that the rigid <HI>Calvinistical</HI> Notion of it, and the In∣ferences they draw from it, are not only most <HI>absurd,</HI> but likewise <HI>blasphemous</HI> against <HI>God.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>And the <HI>Effects</HI> of it (some of which I have seen) among the common <HI>Presbyte∣rians</HI> are terrible. For their <HI>Heads</HI> being perpetually fill'd with the abstruse Notions of <HI>Predestination, Election, Reprobation,</HI> and <HI>Secret Decrees</HI> of <HI>God;</HI> and that they have no <HI>Free-will</HI> or <HI>Choice</HI> what to do, but must go on as it is <HI>secretly Decreed.</HI> This, as it of common Consequence makes Men careless; (for why shou'd they <HI>struggle</HI> when ther is no <HI>remedy,</HI> and their <HI>Sentence</HI> is alrea∣dy past, and that <HI>ir-revocably?</HI>) So it is observable, that more of THESE dye in <HI>Despair,</HI> than of any other sort of People. I have seen them cry out on their <HI>Death-Beds</HI> for <HI>Assurance! Assurance! Oh!</HI> What
<PB N="14" REF="002100_0023_0FBB818559DC6C20"/>
shall I do for <HI>Assurance!</HI> And when the <HI>Merits</HI> and <HI>Satisfaction</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> has been <HI>preach'd</HI> to them, they wou'd say, <HI>alas!</HI> What is that to me, if I be not one of the <HI>Elect?</HI> For <HI>Christ</HI> dy'd <HI>only</HI> for the <HI>Elect.</HI> (This is another of their <HI>Doctrines,</HI> pursu∣ant to their <HI>Notion</HI> of <HI>Predestination,</HI> that the <HI>Decrees</HI> of <HI>God</HI> may not be frustrated.) And when they were ask'd, why they did doubt of their <HI>Election?</HI> And bid look into their <HI>Lives,</HI> which bating <HI>humane Infirmi∣ties,</HI> were <HI>good</HI> and <HI>vertuous,</HI> in the common Size of Mankind; and therefor that they might take this as a <HI>Mark</HI> of their <HI>Electi∣on:</HI> They wou'd answer, that the <HI>good Works</HI> of the <HI>Reprobate</HI> were <HI>hateful</HI> to <HI>God,</HI> (for so they had been taught) and there∣for that this was no <HI>sure Mark.</HI> Nothing but <HI>Election! Election!</HI> was in their Minds. The Condition of these poor People is most <HI>lamentable. Election</HI> is with them a <HI>secret Decree,</HI> without any respect to our Works. And they can have no other <HI>Assurance</HI> of it, but that of their own <HI>Imagination.</HI> They cannot, as the <HI>Apostle</HI> requires, be always ready to render a <HI>Reason</HI> of the Hope that is in them.

<P>I thank God my <HI>Faith</HI> (which I have learn'd in the Church of <HI>England</HI>) is this, That <HI>Christ</HI> dy'd for all Mankind, and con∣sequently for <HI>me</HI> in particular. And I have his <HI>Promise,</HI> which is an <HI>infallible Assurance;</HI> that if I <HI>believe</HI> and <HI>trust</HI> in that compleat <HI>Satisfaction</HI> he has made for all my <HI>Sins,</HI> and truly <HI>repent</HI> of them, I shall be <HI>Sav'd.</HI> And tho' my <HI>Faith</HI> be weak, that I say, <HI>Lord I believe, help mine unbelief;</HI> and my <HI>Repen∣tance</HI> is unworthy, and fit to be <HI>repented</HI> of, and all my <HI>Righteousness</HI> is as <HI>filthy rags,</HI> yet I <HI>despair</HI> not, because the <HI>Satisfaction</HI> made for my <HI>Sins</HI> was perform'd by <HI>Christ</HI> in his own Person, wholly without me, in which I have no <HI>Share</HI> or <HI>Part</HI> at all; I paid not, nor cou'd pay one <HI>Penny</HI> of my <HI>Debt,</HI> or make any Satisfaction to <HI>infinit</HI> offended <HI>Justice;</HI> but my whole <HI>Debt</HI> was paid by my <HI>Surety,</HI> and by <HI>Him alone</HI> full <HI>Satisfacti∣on</HI> was made, who <HI>only</HI> cou'd make it. And my <HI>Faith</HI> is the <HI>Hand</HI> that <HI>reaches</HI> this <HI>Me∣dicin</HI> to me, and <HI>applys</HI> it. The Vertue is not in the Hand, but in the <HI>Medicin.</HI> But the stronger the <HI>Faith,</HI> the greater the <HI>Com∣fort.</HI> Therefor, <HI>Lord increase my Faith,</HI> and I pray, that <HI>my Faith fail not.</HI> They who <HI>look'd</HI> upon the <HI>brasen Serpent</HI> were healed, yet some had <HI>better Sight</HI> than others.

<PB N="16" REF="002100_0025_0FBB81883976B568"/>
<HI>so was the Son of Man lifted up, that who∣soever believeth in Him should have eternal Life.</HI> Thus my <HI>Faith</HI> is in <HI>Christ,</HI> but not in my <HI>Faith</HI> it self. And if I have but a Grain of it, as big as a <HI>Mustard-seed,</HI> the <HI>Mountain</HI> of my Sins will be remov'd &amp; cast into the <HI>Sea.</HI> If my Faith be well grounded, tho <HI>weak,</HI> and my <HI>Repentance</HI> be sincere, tho' <HI>unworthy,</HI> I am upon <HI>Jacob's</HI> Ladder, and tho' upon the <HI>lowest Step,</HI> yet in the <HI>Road</HI> to <HI>Heaven.</HI> Some are upon an <HI>higher</HI> Step, and some upon a <HI>lower,</HI> but all are <HI>safe.</HI> This is my <HI>Faith,</HI> and my <HI>Assu∣rance,</HI> and this is the <HI>Reason</HI> and the <HI>Rock</HI> upon which it is built. But what <HI>Reason</HI> can any Man give for his being <HI>elected</HI> by a <HI>secret Decree,</HI> which He knows not? He <HI>fancies</HI> himself <HI>elected!</HI> Ther can be no more in it. For, as You have said before, ther can be no sure <HI>Mark</HI> of it, even by the Principles of the <HI>Predestinarians.</HI> And what then cou'd the <HI>Apostle</HI> mean (in their Sense) by bidding us <HI>Make our Cal∣ling and Election sure?</HI> What! Is not the <HI>Decree</HI> of <HI>God</HI> sure without us?</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I am pleas'd with the Account you have given of your <HI>Faith.</HI> And you ought to bless <HI>God</HI> that you have been educated in the Church of <HI>England,</HI> where you have
<PB N="17" REF="002100_0026_0FBB8189C1496C08"/>
been instructed in the true <HI>Foundations</HI> of <HI>Christianity,</HI> which give all the <HI>Assurance</HI> that the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Promise</HI> of <HI>God</HI> can give. And this is the highest <HI>Reason.</HI> But the <HI>Assurance</HI> of the <HI>Predestinarians</HI> is all <HI>Imagination,</HI> being built upon <HI>Decrees</HI> which they confess to be <HI>secret</HI> and <HI>hid∣den</HI> from us. Therefor it is no Wonder they shou'd cry out for <HI>Assurance</HI> in their Extremity. And when they <HI>say</HI> or may <HI>think</HI> they have it, and <HI>boast</HI> in it, yet they can give no Reason for it, and therefor it is but <HI>Imagination</HI> still. Im∣pressions upon the <HI>Imagination</HI> may give great <HI>Pleasure</HI> and even <HI>Raptures</HI> of <HI>Joy.</HI> And if these are built upon the true <HI>Foundation,</HI> they are <HI>Gold</HI> and <HI>precious Stones;</HI> otherwise they are but <HI>Hay</HI> and <HI>Stubble,</HI> and will not endure the <HI>Fire.</HI> They are often the <HI>Delusion</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> who thus transforms himself into an <HI>Angel</HI> of <HI>Light,</HI> and deceives many an <HI>unstable</HI> Soul. But they must be try'd by the <HI>Foundation.</HI> Upon which they are not built, if we can give no <HI>Reason</HI> for them, but are <HI>Flashes</HI> and <HI>Meteors,</HI> and give a <HI>false Light.</HI> We may know them likewise by their Effects. If such <HI>Transports</HI> leave us more <HI>humble</HI> in our selves, and with more <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Cha∣rity</HI>
<PB N="18" REF="002100_0027_0FBB818B74A4FD60"/>
to others, they come from <HI>God.</HI> But if they fill us with <HI>spiritual Pride,</HI> and make us look down upon others as beneath us, they come, no Doubt, from the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Pride,</HI> and tempt us to <HI>Pride;</HI> tho' some∣times without our Knowing it, and while we act <HI>Humility.</HI> Ther is none so <HI>proud</HI> as the <HI>proud-humble man,</HI> who is <HI>proud</HI> of his <HI>Humility!</HI> So subtile is our <HI>Adversary,</HI> that we must watch even over our <HI>Vertues.</HI> He mixes <HI>Poyson</HI> with our <HI>Meat.</HI> So that we often put <HI>Darkness</HI> for <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> for <HI>Darkness.</HI> And if the <HI>Light</HI> that is in us be <HI>Darkness,</HI> how great is the <HI>Darkness!</HI> And this must be known by <HI>Reason.</HI> My <HI>Reason</HI> tells me, that I can build no <HI>Assurance</HI> upon <HI>Decrees</HI> which are <HI>hidden</HI> and kept <HI>secret</HI> from me. But whatever those <HI>Decrees</HI> are, my <HI>Reason</HI> assures me they cannot be <HI>con∣trary</HI> or <HI>against</HI> the <HI>revea'ld Will</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> which is given us in the <HI>holy Scriptures;</HI> be∣cause that wou'd be for <HI>God</HI> to <HI>contradict</HI> Himself.

<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>I Hope Sir, that what you have said of <HI>Predestination</HI> will satisfie others as well as it has me. <HI>First,</HI> that the whole Dispute, as manag'd by the <HI>Calvinists,</HI> is all built upon a wrong <HI>Foundation,</HI> even by their own <HI>Confession,</HI> in arguing <HI>strictly</HI> from Words <HI>ad Captum,</HI> and which they confess to be so; and will not suffer the like to be done in any other Case. Therefor that they ought to stop their Disputes upon this Point, till they can find <HI>proper</HI> Words to speak by, if they will speak <HI>properly</HI> of <HI>God.</HI> And these Disputes ought to cease for a second Reason you have given, which is, that they are <HI>useless,</HI> because whatever the <HI>secret Decrees</HI> of <HI>God</HI> may be suppos'd to be, yet that they cannot <HI>go against</HI> or <HI>invalidate</HI> his Will declar'd openly in the <HI>holy Scriptures,</HI> for that wou'd be to <HI>contradict</HI> Himself. Therefor that we may work in <HI>Hope,</HI> and chear∣fully apply our selves to the <HI>performing</HI> of what He has <HI>commanded</HI> us; with full <HI>Trust</HI> and <HI>Assurance</HI> in what He has <HI>pro∣mis'd,</HI> without <HI>perplexing</HI> and <HI>intangling</HI> our selves in these <HI>Disputes</HI> about his <HI>secret
<PB N="20" REF="002100_0029_0FBB8191E38BCEC8"/>
Decrees;</HI> for they must go according to his <HI>reveal'd Will.</HI> In this we are <HI>sure,</HI> and therefor these <HI>Disputes</HI> are at the best <HI>useless</HI> to us; but of most pernicious <HI>Consequence</HI> when taken by the wrong Handle, as you have fully shew'd. But ther is one Thing wherein Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> and the <HI>Predestinari∣ans</HI> do very much boast, they say that their Doctrin is agreeable to our 39 <HI>Articles;</HI> and therefor that our <HI>Clergy</HI> have <HI>apostatiz'd</HI> (as Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> words it) from the Do∣ctrin of the Church of <HI>England:</HI> and that the <HI>Dissenters</HI> are the true <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>En∣gland,</HI> because they hold <HI>Predestination,</HI> and are against <HI>Free-will,</HI> as they say our <HI>Arti∣cles</HI> likewise speak. Now tho' this be no Argument as to the Doctrin it self, yet to those of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> it is of very great <HI>Consequence,</HI> as well to vindicate the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> as to stop the Mouths of <HI>Dissenters,</HI> which are all open upon us on this Account.</P>

<P>The tenth <HI>Article</HI> is of <HI>Free-will.</HI> Which is not at all there deny'd, but ra∣ther suppos'd and asserted. But it suppo∣ses the Concurrence of the <HI>Grace</HI> of <HI>God</HI> by <HI>Christ</HI> to be necessary to <HI>incline</HI> and <HI>guide</HI> our <HI>Will,</HI> and to <HI>work</HI> with us, <HI>When we have that good Will.</HI> Which is exactly agreeable
<PB N="21" REF="002100_0030_0FBB8192DB60CDE8"/>
to what I have said before of <HI>Grace</HI> and our <HI>working</HI> with it, page 6.</P>
<P>The 17th <HI>Article</HI> is of <HI>Predestination.</HI> And keeps to the <HI>Scripture-Phrase</HI> of God's <HI>ordaining before the World began,</HI> of <HI>calling</HI> whom he <HI>fore-knew, justifying, sanctifying</HI> them, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Which is to be understood in the <HI>same</HI> and no <HI>other</HI> sense than as these Words are us'd in <HI>holy Scripture,</HI> which all agree to be <HI>ad Captum,</HI> as we have dis∣cours'd it before. And these Expressions of <HI>Scripture</HI> are, according to our Capacities and Manner of speaking, as this <HI>Article</HI> says, <HI>full of sweet, pleasant and unspeakable Comfort to godly Persons.</HI> But then this <HI>Article</HI> checks the <HI>Curiosities</HI> of this Dis∣pute (which is what I have been bla∣ming) and says, <HI>For curious and carnal Per∣sons lacking the Spirit of Christ, to have con∣tinually before their Eyes the Sentence of God's Predestination, is a most dangerous Down∣fal, whereby the Devil doth thrust them ei∣ther into Desperation, or into Wretchlesness of most unclean Living, no less Pernicious than Desperation.</HI></P>

<P>Then the <HI>Article</HI> ends thus, <HI>Fur∣thermore,
<PB N="22" REF="002100_0031_0FBB819452407470"/>
We must receive God's Promises in such wise as they be generally set forth to us in holy Scripture: And in our Doings, that Will of God is to be follow'd, which we have expresly declared unto us in the Word of God.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>This is just as you have concluded, That we may safely trust in <HI>God's Pro∣mises,</HI> and perform our Duty chearfully which He has commanded in <HI>holy Scrip∣ture,</HI> without perplexing our selves about his <HI>Secret Decrees.</HI> Therefore instead of these <HI>Articles</HI> being against you, or you a∣gainst them, you have perfectly follow'd them in your Arguments, and explained them.</P>

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Observe further, that ther is not a Word of <HI>Reprobation</HI> in all this 17th <HI>Arti∣cle</HI> of <HI>Predestination,</HI> nothing of God's ha∣ving <HI>Fore-decree'd</HI> any to <HI>Misery,</HI> but it speaks only of those whom He has elect∣ed to <HI>Salvation.</HI> So that the rigid <HI>Calvinists</HI> against whom we have been disputing can find no Colour of Umbrage in their Fa∣vour from this <HI>Article.</HI> Therefore whate∣ver the Opinion of particular Men might have been, this cannot be charg'd upon the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>There was a Time when some of our <HI>Divines</HI> ran in too much with the <HI>Calvinists.</HI>
<PB N="23" REF="002100_0032_0FBB8195B7FD2528"/>
In the <HI>Marian</HI> Persecution many fled to <HI>Geneva</HI> and those Parts. And the joint Cause against <HI>Popery,</HI> together with the <HI>Smart</HI> of their own <HI>Persecution,</HI> inclin'd 'em to all the favourable Opinion they cou'd have of their <HI>Friends,</HI> who gave them <HI>Shel∣ter.</HI> By this Mean some were tinctur'd with these <HI>rigid Notions</HI> of <HI>Predestination.</HI> And when they return'd to <HI>England</HI> in the Reign of Queen <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> their Reputation made this Doctrin go down more easily with some People.</P>
<P>But our <HI>English Cyprian,</HI> and holy <HI>Mar∣tyr,</HI> the great Arch-Bishop LAUD, set himself to stop the Torrent of this <HI>Infecti∣on,</HI> and when he was <HI>Chancellor</HI> of <HI>Oxford,</HI> He turn'd the Bent of their Studies from these modern <HI>Polemicks,</HI> and Reading the <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>German Systems</HI> of <HI>Divinity,</HI> to learn downwards, and from the first Begin∣ning of <HI>Christianity,</HI> to acquaint themselves with the <HI>Fathers</HI> in the several Ages to our Times: Whereby they wou'd be better a∣ble to judge of the novel Disputes of the <HI>Remonstrants, Anti-Remonstrants, Supra</HI> and <HI>Sub-Lapsarians,</HI> &amp;c. which then tormented the <HI>Reformation</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>Holland;</HI> and wherein WE likewise took part. And that famous <HI>Ʋniversity</HI> (together with her
<PB N="24" REF="002100_0033_0FBB819738C3C4D0"/>
Sister of <HI>Cambridge,</HI> which took the same Method) reap to this Day the Benefit of those pious Instructions of her learned <HI>Chancellor,</HI> which has given them that de∣served Reputation all over <HI>Europe</HI> for their great <HI>Knowledge</HI> and <HI>Exactness</HI> in <HI>Antiqui∣ty;</HI> and the primitive <HI>Doctrin</HI> and <HI>Disci∣plin</HI> of the <HI>Church;</HI> and teaching us to derive our <HI>Faith</HI> from its <HI>Fountain</HI> and <HI>Ori∣ginal,</HI> and to go higher up than either <HI>Lu∣ther</HI> or <HI>Calvin.</HI> For want of which the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>Rome</HI> has gain'd great Advantage against her less learned <HI>Opposers.</HI> For this Cause Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> has thought fit to fall foul upon Arch-Bishop <HI>Laud,</HI> as the <HI>Corrup∣ter</HI> of our <HI>Doctrin.</HI> But WE bless his Me∣mory as the <HI>Restorer</HI> of it. The <HI>Doctor</HI> charges Him and us for bringing in what he calls <HI>Pelagianism,</HI> and <HI>Arminianism.</HI> But He is too learned not to know this to be a Mistake. For tho' we assert <HI>Free-will,</HI> yet we teach the <HI>Concurrence</HI> and even <HI>Necessity</HI> of <HI>Grace,</HI> to enable us to bring forth Fruit unto <HI>God,</HI> as is before explain'd, page 6.</P>

<P>You have made it plain even to me. And now I am frighted to think, that any <HI>Divine</HI> of the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England</HI> shou'd make such an Use of the <HI>Ʋnion</HI> of the two <HI>Kingdoms,</HI> &amp; to propose it in <HI>Print,</HI> as to

joyn with the rigid <HI>Calvinists</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and our own <HI>Dissenters</HI> at Home, against the <HI>Church</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> which he (good Man) calls <HI>Apostate;</HI> and hopes, with this <HI>foreign</HI> and <HI>domestick</HI> Aid, to bring us all back again to the rigid and most abhorrent <HI>Calvinism</HI> of <HI>Predestination;</HI> to throw Men into <HI>Despair,</HI> and <HI>Wretchless∣ness of most unclean Living,</HI> as our <HI>Article</HI> of <HI>Predestination</HI> speaks.

<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>THer is one Point remaining that follows from that of <HI>Predestina∣tion</HI> we have been upon; in which I wou'd have you, <HI>Country-man,</HI> to be well ground∣ed, and therefor must examin you a little upon it. These <HI>Predestinarians</HI> placing all upon the eternal <HI>Decrees</HI> of <HI>Election</HI> and <HI>Reprobation,</HI> allow not of <HI>Ʋniversal Redemp∣tion,</HI> or that <HI>Christ</HI> dy'd for <HI>All.</HI> Because, say they, if <HI>Christ</HI> dy'd for the <HI>Reprobate,</HI> it was totally in vain, and the End of his
<PB N="26" REF="002100_0035_0FBB819BDD030850"/>
<HI>Sufferings</HI> must be frustrated as to them. Besides that he cou'd not intend or design to <HI>Save</HI> those whom <HI>God</HI> had <HI>Reprobated</HI> by an <HI>eternal Decree.</HI></P>
<P>Now let me see what you have to say to this.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>As to <HI>eternal Decrees,</HI> enough has been said to that already, that ther is no arguing from it, being only Words <HI>ad Cap∣tum,</HI> and therefor not to be <HI>strictly</HI> and <HI>pro∣perly</HI> taken. So I dismiss that Point. But now as to <HI>universal Redemption,</HI> the <HI>Scripture</HI> is plain, which says, That <HI>Christ dy'd for all.</HI> And <HI>wou'd have none to perish, but all to come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</HI> And <HI>as in Adam all dye, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</HI> And many other such like Texts.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>But all are not made <HI>alive,</HI> that is, in <HI>Christ,</HI> so as to be <HI>Saved,</HI> for many <HI>perish.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet <HI>Christ</HI> dy'd even for those who <HI>perish.</HI> As it is said 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.11. in the Case of giving <HI>Scandal</HI> to a weak Brother. <HI>And thro' thy Knowledge shall the weak Brother pe∣rish, for whom Christ died?</HI></P>
<P>Now I help my self to understand this, by a familiar Example. Suppose you came to a <HI>Prison,</HI> and taking a List of all the <HI>Debtors,</HI> shou'd pay all their <HI>Debts, Costs,
<PB N="27" REF="002100_0036_0FBB819F82307490"/>
Charges</HI> and all. And opening the <HI>Prison-Doors,</HI> shou'd tell them, they were all at LI∣BERTY who wou'd <HI>accept</HI> of it, and <HI>come out</HI> in such a Time. After which the <HI>Pri∣son-Doors</HI> shou'd be <HI>lock'd</HI> again, and they shou'd be kept there, 'till they had paid the <HI>uttermost Farthing.</HI> Upon this, some thank∣fully accept of your Goodness, and <HI>come out.</HI> But ther are others, who despise your <HI>Mercy,</HI> or will not <HI>believe</HI> you, or understand not the <HI>pleasure</HI> of <HI>Liberty,</HI> but prefer the sordid Life of a <HI>Prison,</HI> the <HI>Pot</HI> and the <HI>Pipe,</HI> and will not <HI>come out.</HI> Which is the very <HI>Condemnation</HI> our <HI>Saviour</HI> spoke of when He said, that <HI>Light was come into the World, but Men loved Darkness rather than Light, because their Deeds were evil.</HI> The <HI>Light</HI> was offer'd to all. But some lov'd <HI>Darkness</HI> better. It is said that <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Death</HI> are set before us, yet some chuse <HI>Death.</HI> An <HI>Habit</HI> of <HI>Sinning</HI> contracts a Love to it, that we are loth to leave it.</P>
<P>The Application is this. The <HI>Debt</HI> of those <HI>Prisoners</HI> who Stay'd in the <HI>Prison</HI> was pay'd as well as of those who came out. And as the <HI>Release</HI> of the one is wholly owing to Him who pay'd the <HI>Debt;</HI> so the <HI>Condemnation</HI> of the other, lies wholly at his own Door, because, He wou'd not ac∣cept
<PB N="28" REF="002100_0037_0FBB81A10BF94308"/>
of his <HI>Liberty. Something</HI> was left to the <HI>Prisoners</HI> to do, <HI>to chuse whether they wou'd come out, or stay in.</HI> God (tho' a God of infinit Mercy) will not save us a∣gainst our Will. This shews <HI>Free-will.</HI> But ther is no <HI>Merit</HI> in us, when we ac∣cept of his <HI>Salvation.</HI> We pay not a <HI>Pen∣ny</HI> of the <HI>Debt,</HI> He pays it all. And all the <HI>Thanks</HI> and the <HI>Glory</HI> is to Him. But if He did not pay my <HI>Debt,</HI> how cou'd I be blam'd for staying in the <HI>Prison,</HI> when my <HI>Debt</HI> lay still upon me, that I cou'd not get out? How cou'd I be call'd <HI>un∣grateful</HI> to Him who <HI>pay'd</HI> nothing for me, nor ever did <HI>design</HI> it? And how can wicked Men be blam'd for <HI>trampling</HI> un∣der Foot the Blood of the <HI>Son</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> for <HI>despising</HI> and <HI>resisting</HI> his <HI>Grace,</HI> if He Shed <HI>no Blood</HI> for them, nor ever gave them any <HI>saving Grace?</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>I desire Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> (or any One of his Opinion) to answer this. But this brings me to another Point which follows in the Train of <HI>Consequences</HI> of these Mens Notion of <HI>Predestination.</HI> For from the <HI>eternal Decrees,</HI> as they put it, they infer that ther can be no failing from <HI>Grace,</HI> because this might defeat the <HI>Decree.</HI> And therefor that Men cannot
<PB N="29" REF="002100_0038_0FBB81A2785BDF28"/>
finally <HI>resist</HI> his <HI>Grace,</HI> or fall from it. This minds me of a remarkable Passage told by Dr. <HI>Bates,</HI> who wrote the <HI>Elen∣chus Motuum nuperorum in Anglia.</HI> He as a Physician was call'd upon to assist that Night that <HI>Oliver</HI> (that Christian Heroe in some Mens Esteem) prov'd a true <HI>De∣liverer</HI> of his Country. The <HI>Ʋsurper</HI> was in great <HI>Agonies</HI> of <HI>Mind,</HI> often <HI>start∣ed,</HI> and ask'd them if they saw any Thing? At length He calls for his <HI>Chaplains.</HI> And the first Question He ask'd them was, <HI>If there was any falling from Grace?</HI> To which being answered, NO,—<HI>then,</HI> said he, <HI>I am safe.</HI> For He suppos'd that some Time or other in his Life he might have had a little <HI>Grace.</HI> And then his <HI>Ʋsurpation,</HI> with the <HI>Murder</HI> of the <HI>King</HI> his <HI>Royal</HI> and <HI>Religious Master,</HI> and <HI>Devastation</HI> of <HI>three Kingdoms,</HI> besides much <HI>Blood-shed</HI> abroad, and the <HI>Overthrow</HI> of the <HI>establish'd Church,</HI> cou'd do him no Hurt! This is a short Way of quieting <HI>Conscience!</HI> and to lull Men asleep in their <HI>Sins!</HI> Thus poor <HI>Souls</HI> are deluded by these <HI>Doctrins</HI> of <HI>Decrees!</HI></P>
<P>In Consequence of which it is a <HI>Max∣im</HI> with them, that <HI>God sees no Sin in his Elect.</HI> Which is indeed, that the <HI>Elect</HI> cannot <HI>sin.</HI> They say that <HI>David</HI> was nothing out of
<PB N="30" REF="002100_0039_0FBB81A41DBCD6B8"/>
God's Favour while he continued in his Sin, more than before he <HI>committed</HI> it, or than after he <HI>repented.</HI> Nay some of them have wrote expresly against <HI>Repentance,</HI> as being a <HI>Derogation</HI> from the <HI>Decrees</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> &amp; supposing 'em to be <HI>conditional.</HI> Whence others have likewise spoke against <HI>Good-Works.</HI> What! Do we think that any Thing we can do, can reverse or alter the <HI>Decrees</HI> of <HI>God?</HI></P>
<P>And as they think the <HI>Elect</HI> cannot <HI>sin,</HI> so they say that others can do nothing else but <HI>sin.</HI> Thus the same Actions are <HI>Sin</HI> in <HI>One,</HI> and <HI>Piety</HI> in the <HI>other.</HI> As the <HI>Poet</HI> said,
<Q><L>The <HI>Saints</HI> may do the same Things by</L>
<L>The <HI>Spirit</HI> in <HI>Sincerity,</HI></L>
<L>Which other: Men are <HI>tempted</HI> to,</L>
<L>And at the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Instance do:</L>
<L>All <HI>Piety</HI> consists therein</L>
<L>In them, in other Men all <HI>Sin.</HI></L></Q></P>
<P>I have read in a Book of one of their celebrated <HI>Preacher's,</HI> a long Comparison betwixt <HI>Esau</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> wherein <HI>Esau</HI> was set forth with all the Advantages of <HI>Worth</HI> and <HI>Honour,</HI> and <HI>Jacob</HI> represented as the <HI>wickedest</HI> Fellow upon Earth; and this Use was made of it, that <HI>God</HI> chose <HI>Jacob</HI> before <HI>Esau,</HI> to shew that his <HI>Decrees</HI> were <HI>absolute,</HI>
<PB N="31" REF="002100_0040_0FBB81A66E719E30"/>
and had no respect to the <HI>Goodness</HI> or <HI>Wick∣edness</HI> of the <HI>Persons.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Then it is all one whether we are good or wicked! Nay <HI>Wickedness</HI> has the Advantage in many Cases, as in this of <HI>E∣sau</HI> and <HI>Jacob!</HI> Sir, these are monstrous <HI>Principles!</HI> And make me now no longer wonder at what one of their eminent <HI>Prea∣chers</HI> in <HI>London</HI> said since the <HI>Revolution,</HI> who being ask'd by some of his <HI>Brethren,</HI> what progress he had made, He said he had made many <HI>Proselytes,</HI> and had a full <HI>Congregation;</HI> but, added he, all the Effect I have found is, That I have preach'd a <HI>Congregation</HI> of <HI>Christians</HI> into a <HI>Congregation</HI> of <HI>Devils.</HI> Per∣haps not knowing the <HI>Cause,</HI> and that this was the natural <HI>Consequence</HI> of those <HI>Do∣ctrines</HI> he had <HI>preach'd</HI> to them.</P>
<P>And are these the <HI>Principles</HI> to which Dr. <HI>Edwards</HI> wou'd have us <HI>reform'd</HI> backwards over, by the <HI>Kirk</HI> in <HI>Scotland</HI> and in <HI>Hol∣land</HI> coming into the Aid of our <HI>Dissenters</HI> at Home? A Blessed <HI>Confederacy!</HI></P>

<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>REverend Sir, before I take my leave of you, I wou'd willingly be infor∣med whether what I have heard of the <HI>Dissenters</HI> be true or not. I have heard that many of them are turn'd <HI>Arians</HI> and <HI>So∣cinians.</HI> I pray now, is it true?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes <HI>Country-man,</HI> it is too true! Ma∣ny of the <HI>dissenting Ministers</HI> themselves have publickly profess'd themselves <HI>Socini∣ans;</HI> that is, they deny <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> to be <HI>God.</HI> These are some of those of whom the <HI>Scripture</HI> speaks, that in the latter Times Men wou'd arise who wou'd deny the <HI>God</HI> that bought them. Their woful <HI>Apostacy, Country-man,</HI> may easily be accounted for. Unhappy Men! They have thrown off the <HI>Succession</HI> of the <HI>Priesthood,</HI> by <HI>which only</HI> the <HI>Ministers</HI> of <HI>Jesus Christ</HI> can demonstrate that they are sent by Him. They have likewise thrown off the sacred <HI>Festivals</HI> &amp; <HI>Fasts</HI> of the <HI>Church,</HI> and the comely and decent Ceremonies which have been practi∣sed in the <HI>Church:</HI> Which tho' they are (simply) no Parts of <HI>Worship,</HI> yet without them, the true Fear of God and his true Worship cannot long be preserved. For these <HI>Festivals, &amp;c.</HI> are like the <HI>Cask</HI> to the <HI>Wine;</HI> The Cask is no Part of the <HI>Wine,</HI> but if
<PB N="33" REF="002100_0042_0FBB81A953615D60"/>
thou breakest the <HI>Cask,</HI> thou inevitably wilt lose the <HI>Wine.</HI></P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>C.</SPEAKER>
<P>Sir, I make no Wonder now, that those Men who so much incline to this wic∣ked <HI>Heresie</HI> shou'd make such a Noise a∣gainst the decent <HI>Ceremonies,</HI> &amp;c. of our excellent Church.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>M.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your Remark is just, Country-man. This was the chief Reason, that made that <HI>Arch-Heretick,</HI> that <HI>uncircumcis'd Philistine,</HI> their infamous Mr. <HI>James Peirce,</HI> who is one of the chief of these <HI>Infidels,</HI> I say it was chiefly his Inclination to this <HI>Heresie</HI> that made him so loudly exclaim against the <HI>Festivals</HI> and <HI>Ceremonies</HI> of our excellent <HI>Church;</HI> particularly against our <HI>Bowing,</HI> in the <HI>publick Assemblies,</HI> at the most <HI>solemn.</HI> and <HI>devout</HI> Mention of the <HI>Name</HI> of the e∣ver blessed JESUS.</P>
<P>This made him say, in his <HI>Vindication</HI> of the <HI>Dissenters,</HI> page 531. <Q>But we can see no Reason why we shou'd rather bow at the Name of <HI>Jesus,</HI> than at the Name <HI>God, Je∣hovah, Christ, or Saviour,</HI> which is the same with <HI>Jesus.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Therefor in Answer to this arrogant and <HI>insulting Infidel,</HI> and to all other Enemies of our holy <HI>Christian Faith,</HI> I will instruct Thee my <HI>Christian Friend</HI> concerning the true
<PB N="34" REF="002100_0043_0FBB81AC8F0DBAB0"/>
Reason of that <HI>laudable</HI> and truly <HI>Pious</HI> Custom, I mean <HI>that</HI> of <HI>reverently Bowing</HI> in the publick Assemblies of <HI>Christians,</HI> at the <HI>solemn</HI> Mention of the Sacred <HI>Name</HI> of the <HI>holy,</HI> the <HI>ever-blessed</HI> and always to be adored JESUS,</P>
<P>The Word JESUS signifies a <HI>Saviour,</HI> and is the <HI>proper</HI> Name of OUR <HI>blessed Saviour,</HI> who had this Name given Him by the <HI>Angel,</HI> before He was conceiv'd in the <HI>Womb.</HI> So that this is his <HI>Personal</HI> Name. The Word <HI>Christ</HI> denotes <HI>only</HI> his <HI>Office,</HI> as He was the <HI>anointed</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> which that <HI>Word</HI> signifies.</P>
<P>Now, there was in the <HI>Apostles</HI> Time, a Set of <HI>Hereticks,</HI> as <HI>Cerinthus</HI> and his <HI>Followers,</HI> who deny'd <HI>This Jesus</HI> to be the <HI>Christ.</HI> They said that <HI>Christ,</HI> or the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> (for they made no Distincti∣on) dwelt in <HI>Jesus,</HI> as in other holy Men. That it descended upon Him at his <HI>Baptism,</HI> but left Him on the <HI>Cross,</HI> which made Him cry, <HI>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</HI> Against these the <HI>Apostles</HI> wrote. And the Burden of their Arguments was to prove that THIS <HI>Jesus</HI> is the <HI>Christ.</HI> As St. <HI>Peter</HI> said, (<HI>Act.</HI> 2.36.) <HI>Therefore let all the House of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made
<PB N="35" REF="002100_0044_0FBB81ADEAA8EDD0"/>
that same Jesus whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.</HI> And St. <HI>John</HI> says, (<HI>Joh.</HI> 20.31.) <HI>These Things are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.</HI> And 1 <HI>Joh.</HI> 2.22.) <HI>Who is a Liar, but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ?</HI> Wherefore St. <HI>Paul</HI> says, (<HI>Phil.</HI> 2.10.) <HI>That at the Name of</HI> JESUS <HI>every Knee should bow.</HI> This was owning HIM to be the <HI>Christ.</HI> Which is truly to be a <HI>Christian.</HI> And the <HI>Bowing</HI> at any <HI>other Name,</HI> do's not shew this. To bow at the <HI>Name</HI> of <HI>God</HI> do's not distinguish me from a <HI>Jew,</HI> a <HI>Mahometan,</HI> or an <HI>Heathen,</HI> who all acknowledge a <HI>God.</HI> And to bow at the Name of <HI>Christ</HI> or the <HI>Messiah,</HI> do's not shew but that I may be a <HI>Jew,</HI> for they own a <HI>Christ,</HI> and expect him yet to come. But they expresly deny that <HI>this</HI> JESUS is the Christ. And (alas!) we have the same Cause of distinguishing our selves at this Day, where many that shelter them∣selves under the Name of <HI>Christians,</HI> (ay, and good <HI>Protestants</HI> too) are profess'd <HI>Deists,</HI> and <HI>blaspheme</HI> that worthy <HI>Name</HI> by which we are called, saying, <Q>The old Romans did him Justice to punish Him with the Death of a Slave.</Q> — (Oh! cursed Blasphemy!) This is taken out of a Pam∣phlet
<PB N="36" REF="002100_0045_0FBB81AF5F5C80E0"/>
entit'led, <HI>The Growth of Deism,</HI> ap∣prov'd and recommended by the infamous and execrable <HI>Tyndal</HI> in his blasphemous Book of the <HI>Rights;</HI> (which Book of the <HI>Rights</HI> is highly valued by many of the <HI>Dissenters.</HI> — Unhappy Men!) And we shall not distinguish our selves from these by <HI>Bowing</HI> at the Name of <HI>God.</HI> Then a∣gain, the <HI>Quakers</HI> do expresly deny the Man <HI>Jesus</HI> to be the <HI>Christ,</HI> they run in directly with the <HI>Heresie</HI> of <HI>Cerinthus,</HI> and say that <HI>Christ</HI> or the <HI>Light</HI> dwelt in <HI>Jesus,</HI> they make <HI>Christ</HI> and <HI>Jesus</HI> to be <HI>two.</HI> There∣for <HI>Bowing</HI> at the Name of <HI>Christ</HI> will not distinguish us from these. But <HI>Bowing</HI> at the Sacred Name of <HI>Jesus,</HI> is owning THAT <HI>Person,</HI> THAT Man <HI>Jesus</HI> to be the <HI>Christ.</HI> And nothing less than this (owning <HI>Christ</HI>) can denominate a Man to be a <HI>Christian.</HI></P>
<P>I don't say it is <HI>necessary</HI> or an <HI>Arti∣cle</HI> of <HI>Faith</HI> always to <HI>bow</HI> at the Name of <HI>Jesus.</HI> But I hope I may say from the <HI>Authorities</HI> and <HI>Reasons</HI> I have offer'd, that ther can be no <HI>Harm</HI> in it, far less a∣ny <HI>Superstition.</HI> That it is highly <HI>decent</HI> and a <HI>Profession</HI> of our <HI>Christianity.</HI> And that THOSE who refrain from it out of a <HI>Principle,</HI> give Grounds of <HI>Suspicion, that
<PB N="37" REF="002100_0046_0FBB81B100730D20"/>
they are not sound in the Faith,</HI> and lean more to the <HI>Deists, Socinians</HI> or <HI>Principles</HI> of the <HI>Quakers,</HI> than to the <HI>Christian Church.</HI> At least they give Countenance to these <HI>Ene∣mies of Christianity,</HI> while they joyn with them in refusing this <HI>Publick Attestation</HI> which the Church gives of her <HI>Faith</HI> in the <HI>crucify'd</HI> JESUS. We <HI>bow</HI> or <HI>uncover</HI> our selves at the Name of an <HI>Earthly King,</HI> when his <HI>Grants</HI> or <HI>Patents</HI> are read. And may we not <HI>bow</HI> at the Name of the <HI>King</HI> of <HI>Kings,</HI> and <HI>Lord of Lords!</HI></P>

<P>Reverend Sir, I thank Thee for these pious <HI>Instructions</HI> and <HI>Exhortations.</HI> And I thank my good God, that I have not so learned <HI>Christ,</HI> as like these <HI>Infi∣dels</HI> to be asham'd of the <HI>crucify'd Je∣sus.</HI> No, as for me and my House, we will serve the Lord CHRIST. And while the <HI>infidel</HI> World, and <HI>Luke-warm Christians</HI> are asham'd to own their God and their Redeemer, I will excite my <HI>Christian</HI> Neighbours (by my Example) in the <HI>Assemblies</HI> of <HI>Christians</HI> for Pub∣lick Worship, humbly to <HI>bow down,</HI> and with godly Reverence adore, at the so∣lemn Mention of the <HI>Name</HI> of our great God, and our holy Redeemer, the Cap∣tain

of our Salvation; the holy, the a∣dorable, and ever blessed JESUS.</P>
<P>Reverend Sir, before I take my leave, I entreat that I may join with Thee in offering up this <HI>Hymn</HI> to the <HI>ever-blessed Trinity,</HI> which I have learned by frequent∣ing our most excellent Church, the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>

<HEAD>THE EPISTLE OF St <HI>IGNATIƲS</HI> TO THE <HI>MAGNESIANS.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>IGNATIUS</HI> who is also called <HI>THEOPHO∣RUS;</HI> to the Blessed [Church] by the Grace of God the Father in Jesus Christ our Saviour: In whom I salute the Church which is at <HI>MAGNESIA</HI> near the <HI>MAEANDER;</HI> and wish it all Joy, in God the Father, and in Jesus Christ.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P N="1">I. WHEN I heard of your well order'd Love and Charity in God, being full of joy I desired much to speak unto you in the Faith of Jesus Christ. For hav∣ing been thought worthy to obtain a most Excellent Name, in the Bonds which I carry about, I salute the Churches; wish∣ing in them a Union both of the Body &amp; Spirit of Jesus Christ, our Eternal Life: <HI>As also</HI> of Faith and Charity, to which nothing is preferred: But especially of Jesus and the
<PB N="40" REF="002100_0049_0FBB81B5F9CBBB08"/>
Father; in whom if we undergo all the In∣juries of the Prince of this present World, and escape, we shall enjoy God.</P>
<P N="2">II. SEEING then I have been judged worthy to see you, by DAMAS your most Excellent Bishop; and by your <HI>very</HI> worthy Presbyters BASSUS, and APOLLONIUS; and by my Fellow Servant SOTIO the Dea∣con; in whom I rejoyce, forasmuch as He is subject unto <HI>his</HI> Bishop as to the Grace of God, and to the Presbytery as to the Law of Jesus Christ; <HI>I determined to Write unto you.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. WHEREFORE it will become you also not to use your Bishop too familiarly upon the account of his Youth; but to yield all Reverence to Him according to the Pow∣er of God the Father: As also I perceive that your Holy Presbyters do; not consider∣ing his Age, which indeed to appearance is Young; but as becomes those who are Prudent in God, submitting to Him, or rather not to Him, but to the Father of <HI>our Lord</HI> Jesus Christ the Bishop of us All. It will there∣fore behove you, with all Sincerity, to obey your <HI>Bishop;</HI> in Honour of Him whose pleasure it is <HI>that you should do so.</HI> Because he that <HI>does not do so,</HI> deceives not the Bishop whom he sees, but affronts him that is In∣visible.
<PB N="41" REF="002100_0050_0FBB81B797335C90"/>
For whatsoever of this kind <HI>is done,</HI> it reflects not upon Man, but upon God, who knows the Secrets of <HI>our Hearts.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. IT is therefore fitting, that we should not only be called Christians, but be so. As some call <HI>indeed their Governour,</HI> Bishop; but yet do all things without Him. But I can never think that such as these have a good Conscience, seeing they are not gather'd to∣gether throughly according to <HI>God's Com∣mandment.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. SEEING then <HI>all</HI> things have an End, there are these two indifferently set before Us, Death and Life: And every one shall depart unto his proper place. For as there are two sorts of Coins, the one of God, the other of the World; and each of these has its proper Inscription engraven upon it; <HI>So also is it Here.</HI> The Unbelievers are of this World; but the Faithful, through Charity, have the Character of God the Father by Je∣sus Christ: By whom if we are not readily disposed to Die after the likeness of his Pas∣sion, His Life is not in Us.</P>
<P N="6">VI. FORASMUCH therefore as I have in the Persons before-mentioned, seen all of you in Faith and Charity; I exhort you that ye study to do all things in a Divine Concord: Your Bishop presiding in the place of God;
<PB N="42" REF="002100_0051_0FBB81BA55C6CC70"/>
your Presbyters in the place of the Council of the Apostles; and your Deacons most dear to Me, being intrusted with the Ministry of Jesus Christ; who was with the Father be∣fore all Ages, and appeared in the End <HI>to us.</HI> Wherefore taking the same Holy Course, <HI>see that</HI> ye all Reverence one another: And let no one look upon his Neighbour after the Flesh; but do ye all mutually love each other in Je∣sus Christ. Let there be nothing that may be able to make a Division among you; but be ye united to your Bishop, and those who Preside over you, to be your Pattern and Direction <HI>in the way</HI> to Immortality.</P>
<P N="7">VII. AS therefore the LORD did nothing without the Father, being united to Him; neither by Himself nor <HI>yet</HI> by his Apostles; So neither do ye do any thing without your Bishop &amp; Presbyters: Neither endeavour to let any thing appear rational to your selves apart; but being come together into the same place, have one <HI>Common</HI> Prayer; One Sup∣plication; One Mind; One Hope; in Char∣ity, and in Joy undefiled. There is One Lord Jesus Christ, than whom nothing is Better. Wherefore come ye all together as unto one Temple of God; as to one Altar, as to one Jesus Christ; who proceeded from one Father, and exists in One, and is re∣turn'd <HI>to One.</HI></P>
<P N="8"><PB N="43" REF="002100_0052_0FBB81BD02A7A448"/>VIII. BE not Deceived with Strange Do∣ctrins; nor with Old Fables which are un∣profitable. For if we still continue to live ac∣cording to the Jewish Law, we do confess <HI>our selves</HI> not to have received Grace. For even the most Holy Prophets lived according to Christ Jesus. <HI>And</HI> for this cause were they persecuted, being inspired by his Grace, to convince the Unbelievers and Disobedient that there is one God who has manifested Himself by Jesus Christ his Son; who is his Eternal Word, not coming forth from Si∣lence, who in all things pleased Him that sent Him.</P>
<P N="9">IX. WHEREFORE if they who were brought up in <HI>these</HI> antient Laws came <HI>never∣theless</HI> to the Newness of Hope; no longer observing Sabbaths, but keeping the Lord's Day, in which also our Life is sprung up by Him, and through his Death, whom <HI>yet</HI> some deny: (By which Mystery we have been brought to Believe, and therefore wait that we may be found the Disciples of Jesus Christ, our only Master:) How shall we be able to live Different from Him; whose Disciples the very Prophets themselves be∣ing, did by the Spirit expect Him as their Master. And therefore He whom they justly waited for, being come, raised them up from the Dead.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="44" REF="002100_0053_0FBB81BE6A0412B0"/>X. LET us not then be Insensible of his Goodness; for should he have dealt with us according to our Works, we had not now had a Being. Wherefore being become his Disciples, let us learn to live according to the <HI>Rules</HI> of Christianity: For whosoever is called by any other name besides this, He is not of God. Lay aside therefore the Old, and Sour, and Evil Leaven; and be ye changed into the New Leaven, which is Jesus Christ. Be ye salted in Him, lest any one among you should be Corrupted; for by your Savour ye shall be Judged. It is Ab∣surd to <HI>Name</HI> Jesus Christ, and to Judaize. For the Christian Religion did not imbrace the Jewish, but the Jewish the Christian; that so every Tongue that Believed might be gathered together unto God.</P>
<P N="11">XI. THESE things, my Beloved, <HI>I write unto you;</HI> not that I know of any among you that lye under this Error: But as one of the least amongst you I am desirous to fore∣warn you that ye fall not into the Snares of Vain Doctrine: But that ye be fully instructed in the Birth, and Suffering, and Resurrection of Jesus Christ, our Hope; which was accomplished in the Time of the Government of <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> and that most truly and certainly; and from which God
<PB N="45" REF="002100_0054_0FBB81C07A7879B0"/>
forbid that any among you should be turn'd aside.</P>
<P N="12">XII. MAY I <HI>therefore</HI> have Joy of you in all things, if I shall be worthy of it. For tho' I am Bound, yet I am not worthy to be compared to one of you that are at Liberty. I know that ye are not puffed up; for ye have Jesus Christ in your Hearts. And es∣pecially when I commend you, I know that ye are Ashamed, as it is written, <HI>The Just Man condemneth himself.</HI></P>
<P N="13">XIII. STUDY therefore to be confirm'd in the Doctrine of our LORD, and of <HI>his</HI> Apostles; that so whatsoever ye do, ye may prosper both in Body and Spirit; in Faith and Charity; in the Son, and in the Father, &amp; in the <HI>Holy</HI> Spirit; in the Beginning, &amp; in the End: Together with your most worthy Bishop, and the well-wrought Spiritual Crown of your Presbytery, and your Deacons <HI>which are</HI> according to God. Be subject to your Bishop, and to one another, as Jesus Christ to the Father according to the Flesh; and the Apostles both to Christ, and to the Father, and to the <HI>Holy</HI> Ghost; that so ye may be united both in Body and Spirit.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. KNOWING you to be full of God, I have the more briefly exhorted you. Be mindful of me in your Prayers, that I may
<PB N="46" REF="002100_0055_0FBB81C22A6C0028"/>
attain unto God; and of the Church that is in <HI>Syria,</HI> from which I am not worthy to be called. For I stand in need of your joint-Prayers in God, and of your Charity, that the Church which is in <HI>Syria</HI> may be thought worthy to be nourish'd by your Church.</P>
<P N="15">XV. THE <HI>Ephesians</HI> from <HI>Smyrna</HI> salute you; from which place I write unto you; (being present <HI>here</HI> to the Glory of God, in like manner as you are,) who have in all things refresh'd me; together with <HI>Polycarp</HI> the Bishop of the <HI>Smyrnaeans.</HI> The rest of the Churches, in the Honour of Jesus Christ, salute you. Farewell, <HI>and be ye strengthned</HI> in the Concord of God; enjoying his Inse∣parable Spirit, which is Jesus Christ.</P>
