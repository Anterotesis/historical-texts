<P>—If any Man worship the Beast and his Image, and receive his mark in his Fore∣head, or in his Hand. The same shall drink of the Wine of the wrath of GOD, which is poured out without Mixture, into the Cup, of his Indig∣nation, and he shall be tormented with Fire, and Brimstone in the presence of the holy Angels, and the presence of the Lamb: And the smoke of their Torment ascendeth up for ever, &amp; ever.—</P></Q>

<HEAD>TO THE General COURT AT BOSTON, <HI>May</HI> 29<SUP>th</SUP> 1754.</HEAD>
<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HESE Lines are to Signify, that I have Ex∣amined your <HI>Confession of Faith,</HI> and have Quoted out of said Confession four Articles; and by the Scriptures have proved them to be Er∣roneous, being Contrary, and against plain Scripture, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Your first Day Sabbath:</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. And concerning Swearing:</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. And Baptism:</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. As also the Civil Government:</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="007622_0004_102BAB7017205578"/>
And these I have Quoted, not because they were easier Confuted than others; but because to keep a good Conscience in the Opposing of these said Articles, has proved a more direct Leading into Persecution: As a also in the Proving of the said Articles to be Contrary to Scripture and against plain Scripture proves your Confession to be Erroneous, or an Image made to the Beast, see, <HI>Rev.</HI> 13. <HI>v.</HI> 14, and as by the following <HI>Treatise</HI> will ap∣pear and your Established Ministers to be Antichristian Ministers, and your Churches Consequently Antichristian Churches, or Synagogues of Satan, <HI>Rev.</HI> 3.9. And you Rulers of the Common-Wealth, whilst you use the Sword that GOD hath put into your Hands to Rule in the Common-Wealth, only to do Justice, and Equity between Man, and Man, are the Ordinance of GOD, and Ministers of GOD, <HI>Rom.</HI> 13.1, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.13, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But as you presume to Judge in Cases of Conscience, and that, that Concerns the Worship of GOD, you become the Ministers of Satan, and Act under the Power, and Authority of the Dra∣gon, as is fully Declared, <HI>Rev.</HI> Chap. 13, and is described in divers other Places
<PB N="vii" REF="007622_0005_102BAB4DB560F678"/>
in said <HI>Rev.</HI> By Worshipping the Beast, and his Image. By the Beast, is to be understood the worldly Powers; and by his Image, that form of Worship they Establish, and Defend.</P>
<P>And now let us take a View of the Conduct of our Ancestors, briefly touching the Sufferings of the Anabaptists, and Quakers: as also the Evils that befel <HI>New-England</HI> afterwards, as they have left them on Record in the Book of their Confession, Pag. 94 in two Ques∣tions.</P>
<P>Question 1st. <HI>What are the Evils that have provoked the LORD to bring His Judgments on</HI> New-England?</P>
<P>As for the Sufferings of the Anabaptists it was for Separating from the Establish∣ed Churches in the Country, under a scruple of Baptism; accounting their Baptism no Baptism, and the Baptizing Infants Unlawful, this Occasioned the Civil Magistrates to put forth their Au∣thority by Fining, Whipping and Im∣prisoning the said Anabaptists, as may be seen more at Large in <HI>Daniel Neals
<PB N="viii" REF="007622_0006_102BAB71D7BF5498"/>
History of New-England.</HI> Vol. 1. Page 278, to 291.</P>
<P>Soon after the Anabaptists, came the Quakers into <HI>Boston</HI> Colony, and were proceeded against in like Manner, by Fining, Imprisoning, and Whipping: but these Punishments proving Ineffectual to keep them out of their Government, they proceeded to make many Laws, annex∣ing many, and grievous Punishments, as may be seen at Large in <HI>Bishops History of New-England.</HI> Judged also (said <HI>Neals</HI> History, Vol. 1 pag. 291. to last) till it came to cutting off Ears, and Banishment, upon pain of Death, and putting to Death; so that by said Quakers was Fulfilled that in Rev. 12.11. <HI>And they Overcame him by the Blood of the LAMB, and by the Word of their Testimony, and they loved not their Lives unto the Death.</HI> So that they have undeniably purchased to themselves the title of worthy Martyrs, and they that Persecuted them, shewed no better Spirit than they that Persecuted, and put the Martyrs to Death in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, as they that Read the History of both may see.</P>
<P><PB N="ix" REF="007622_0007_102BAB50DCD662A0"/>
Difference in Perswasions, and so to Defend differing Principles alters nothing. There is but two Spirits Manifest in the World, that is the Spirit of GOD, and the Spirit of the Devil, and these were always at Variance: <HI>Cain</HI> Persecuted his Brother <HI>Abel; Ishmael</HI> Persecuted <HI>Isaac;</HI> the <HI>Egyptians, Israel;</HI> backslidden <HI>Israel</HI> the Prophets: Matth. 23.37. <HI>O Jeru∣salem, Jerusalem, Thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, &amp;c. Herod</HI> and the <HI>Jews</HI> Persecuted CHRIST and His <HI>Apostles:</HI> And so down to this day, under the name of Christians, and a shew of Ho∣liness by outward Observations; these Persecute the true Worshippers of GOD, that Worship Him in Spirit, and in Truth. But, (saith CHRIST) <HI>all their Works they do for to be seen of Men,</HI> Matth. 23.5. That is by their out∣ward shew of Holiness; And now to return to said <HI>Question,</HI></P>
<P N="1">(1.) <HI>What are the Evils that have provoked the LORD to send His Judg∣ments on</HI> New-England?</P>
<P>In Answer to this <HI>Question;</HI> I Quote something from their Answer, and some∣thing
<PB N="x" REF="007622_0008_102BAB73D2313A00"/>
out of the Scriptures, but very Briefly, first in p. 105, they say, <HI>GOD by a continued Series of Providence for many Years one after another, hath been Blasting the fruits of the Earth in a great Measure, and this Year more abun∣dantly,</HI> &amp;c. Now let us Compare their own Confession with Gen. 4.11, 12. <HI>And now art thou Cursed from the Earth which hath opened her Mouth to receive thy Brothers Blood from thy hand, when thou Tillest the Ground it shall not henceforth Yield unto thee her strength, a Fugitive and a Vagabond shalt thou be in the Earth.</HI> I do not see we need make any further Enquiry into the cause of GOD's cutting us short of the Fruits of the Earth, than this one Sen∣tence from GOD's own Mouth, which was not limited to <HI>Cain</HI> only: But as he was the first Persecutor, so all Per∣secutors expose themselves to the same Curse with him to the end of the World, John 8.44. <HI>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the lusts of your Fa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will do, he was a Murderer from the Beginning,</HI> &amp;c. I say, make no further Enquiry 'till there be due Satisfaction made by Confession and Re∣pentance
<PB N="xi" REF="007622_0009_102BAB525EC8FF28"/>
for the aforesaid Sin of Perse∣cution; they also Enumerate abundance of Evils as the procuring Causes of GOD's Judgments on <HI>New-England,</HI> which had they hearkened to the war∣nings of GOD by His Messengers, the said Quakers, it might have pre∣vented them, and not their own Mouths made to cry out under them: But instead of hearkening, they Persecuted His Messengers, as hath been Declared, and so become fighters against GOD, so as to provoke GOD to Punish them by his Judgments; for when a People are come to that blindness, and hardness of Heart, as not to hearken to GOD's Messengers that He sends, to warn them to turn them from their evil ways, but Persecute them, and put them to Death: What can such a People expect but the Severity of GOD's Judgments? Rev. 16.5, 6. <HI>And I heard the Angel of the Waters say, thou art Righteous, O LORD, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast judged thus, for they have shed the Blood of Saints, and Prophets, and thou hast given them Blood to Drink for they are Worthy.</HI> This is Written for the Encouragement of
<PB N="xii" REF="007622_0010_102BAB7555BD1FE0"/>
GOD's suffering People, who will not suffer their Enemies to exalt themselves over them more than is for his Glory, and their Good, Psal. 76.10. <HI>Surely the wrath of Man shall Praise thee: the remainder of wrath shalt thou restrain</HI> Rom. 15.4. <HI>For whatsoever things were written aforetime, were writ∣ten for our Learning, that we through Patience and Comfort of the Scriptures might have Hope.</HI> But on the other hand, <HI>New-England</HI> has Laboured under Troubles in a general way, of one sort or another since the aforesaid Persecu∣tions; but especially by the hand of the <HI>Heathen,</HI> who have Killed, and carried into Captivity a multitude of People, and wasted the Country in a great Degree.</P>
<P>But in all the Enquiry what are the Evils that have provoked the LORD to bring his Judgments on <HI>New-En∣gland?</HI> Not a word is said, calling in Question the aforesaid Persecutions, but say, page 98, <HI>Quakers are false Wor∣shippers:</HI> Surely this is an Evidence that the Blood of Persecution rests upon them. Rev. 17.4, 5, 6. <HI>And the Woman was
<PB N="xiii" REF="007622_0011_102BAB54865EB108"/>
arrayed in Purple, and Scarlet colour, and decked with Gold, and precious Stone, and Pearls; having a Golden Cup in her hand, full of Abominations, and Fil∣thiness of her Fornication: and upon her Forehead was a Name Written, MYSTERY, BABYLON, THE GREAT, THE MO∣THER OF HARLOTS, AND ABOMI∣NATIONS OF THE EARTH: And I saw the Woman Drunken with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of JESUS,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now <HI>New-England,</HI> bring forth thy Robes of Righteousness, and see if they are not here rightly Described, and that they bare a true Resemblance of this Wo∣mans Attire called the Mother of Har<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and whether our Ancestors did not make themselves drunken with the Blood of the Saints, and Martyrs of Jesus, and in this Drunkenness agreed upon a Confession of Faith; it is Time to examine into these Things, for Judgment is before us both Temporal and Eternal.</P>
<P>As to their second Question, pag. 107, <HI>What is to be done that so these Evils may be Reformed?</HI></P>
<P>To this I Answer, <HI>first,</HI> a Reforma∣tion out of all <HI>Antichristianism,</HI> which

Administration of Church Government here∣with Emitted were presented unto, and Approved and Established by the said General Assembly at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> on the <HI>14th of October, 1708.</HI> This Confession of Faith we offer as our firm Perswasion, well and fully Grounded upon the Holy Scripture, and commend the same unto all, and particularly to the People of our Colony, to be Examined, Accepted and constantly Maintained; we do not Assume to our Selves that any thing be taken upon Trust from us; but commend to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> People these following Counsels.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That you be immoveably and unchangeably Agreed in the only sufficient and unvariable Rule of Religion, which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Holy Scripture, the fixed Cannon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>pable of Addition or Diminution, you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ight to account nothing Ancient that will not stand by this Rule, nor any thing New that will. Do not hold your selves bound to unscriptural Rights in Religion wherein Custom it self doth many times Misguide: Believe it to be the honour of Religion to Resign and Captivate our Wisdom and Faith, to divine Revelation.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="007622_0017_102BAB5BD4A7EEF0"/>
<HI>Secondly,</HI> That you be Determined by this Rule in the whole of Religion. That your Faith be Right and Divine, the Word of God must be the Foundation of it, and the Authority of the Word the Reason of it. You may believe the most Important Articles of Faith, with no more than an Humane Faith; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> this is evermore the cause, when the Pri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ple Faith is resolved into, is any other than the Holy Scripture. For an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christian to resolve his Faith, into Education, Instruction, and the pers;wasion of others is not an higher Reason, than a <HI>Papist Mahometan,</HI> or <HI>Pagan</HI> can produce for his Religion.</P>
<P>Pay also unto God the Worship, that will bear the Tryal of, and receive Esta∣blishment by this Rule. Have alway<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Readiness a Divine Warrant for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> Worship you Perform <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God. Believe that Worship is accepted and that only, which is directed unto, and Commanded, and hath the promise of a Bissing from the Word of God. Believe that Worship not Divinely Commanded is in vain, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> will answer the Necessities and expectations of a Christian, and is a Wor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hip∣ping,
<PB N="20" REF="007622_0018_102BAB7DA2B77F38"/>
you know not what. Believe in all Divine Worship, it is not enough that this or that Act of Worship is not for∣bidden in the World of God; if it be not Commanded, and you perform it, you may fear, you will be found Guilty and exposed to Divine Displeasure. <HI>Nadab,</HI> and <HI>Abihu</HI> paid dear for Offering in Di∣vine Worship that which the Lord Com∣manded them not. It is an honor done unto Christ, when you account that only Decent, Orderly and Convenient in His House, which depends upon the Institution and Appointment of himself, who is the only Head and Law-giver of his Church, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Having taken the above Quoted out of their Preface to said Confession; we may safely join with their advice in the general, and Examine their Articles, and according as we find them to agree, or disagree with the Holy Scriptures to bear Witness boldly.</HI></P>

<P><HI>In the Preface of the form of Church Government, Page 4 they say,</HI> That we might Stand Perfect, and Compleat in all the Will of GOD, and we trust it is our sincere Desire that His Will, all His Will, and nothing else but His Will, might be done among us to the Law, and to the Testimony we do wholly refer our selves, and if any thing in the following Conclusion be Indeed found not to Speak according thereunto let it be Rejected: <HI>These Words to the Law,
<PB N="22" REF="007622_0020_102BAB7F46DBFB40"/>
and to the Testimony, are in Isa. 8 20, The Words in the Verse are,</HI> To the Law, and to the Testimony, if they Speak not according to this Word, it is because there is no Light in them.</P>
<P>Thus far I have Quoted out of each Confession of Faith, and they both re∣fer us to the holy Scriptures, and not barely to take upon trust from their Word; and I have compared both said Con∣fessions together, and they are both one, being Chapter for Chapter, Paragraph for Paragraph, Word for Word, (mistakes in Printing excepted.) But in as much as in <HI>Boston</HI> Confession, they have not brought one Text to prove one Article, throughout their whole Confession. I have therefore made use of some Scrip∣ture Proof's out of <HI>Connecticut</HI> Con∣fession to Confute both, they being both one, as is said Word, for Word; and they are Approved, and Establish∣ed by the General Courts in each Colony.</P>
<P>First, the Elders, and Messengers of each Colony have Recommended them to the civil Government; and the civil
<PB N="23" REF="007622_0021_102BAB6006D2CBB0"/>
Governments have taken them under their Protection to Defend them, that both Elders, and Messengers, and said General Courts, and civil Governments as they own and defend them, they all stand equally charged with an Answer.</P>
<P>Now let us take their Advice as was before Quoted; as also their Ad∣vice in said Preface, Page 8. <HI>And com∣mend the same to your diligent Perusal that you be Established in the Truth, and your Faith rest upon it's proper Bases, the Word of GOD. Follow the example of the Noble Bereans, Search the Scriptures,</HI> &amp;c. Acts 17, 11. <HI>These were more Noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the Word with all rea∣diness of Mind, and searched the Scriptures daily whether those things were so,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And now under the Consideration, that I have Written to all the Associa∣tions in this Colony of <HI>Connecticut;</HI> and have Journeyed from County, to Coun∣ty, and delivered in Writing to one of the Elders in each County, to be delivered to their several Associations, as followeth.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="007622_0022_102BAB80F4EC2438"/>
For as much as I have perused said Confession, and to me it appears, that there are many dangerous, and hurtful Principles, some of which I have Quo∣ted, and presented before said Elders, to be delivered to their several Associ∣ations desiring their further perusal, and if they appear not to have Scripture Foundation, that they would Rectify them, but they disregarded my Request.</P>
<P>I therefore went to the General Court, to desire Them, under the Consideration of the danger of being seated upon, and contending for unsound Principles, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To put said Elders forward, to Answer my Request, which was as little Re∣garded as the other. And this is now near <HI>thirty Years</HI> past; and each Go∣vernment goes on still in approving and defending each Confession.</P>
<P>And now GOD hath put it into my Heart, to reprove both Governments, by your own Confessions; by Rehearsing sundry of your Articles, and proving them to contradict the Scriptures; and some to wrest the Scriptures, and to teach another Doctrine than what was originally Given, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="007622_0023_102BAB62AA5203D0"/>
But before I go any further, I think it not amiss to give some Account of my own Life from my Infancy, and of GOD's Dealing towards me; as <HI>David</HI> saith, Psal. 66.16. <HI>Come and hear all ye that fear GOD, and I will tell you what He hath done for my Soul.</HI> That was his Experiences of GOD's Goodness towards him. And as to my self, my Father lived about a Mile out of <HI>New-London</HI> Town; and my Mother was at home with only three little Children, I being the Youngest (about 10 Months old) she with the other two were Mur∣dered by a youth about 16 years of Age, who was afterwards Executed at <HI>Hartford;</HI> and I was found (as was said) at my dead Mothers Breast.</P>
<P>And since in the course of my Life GOD hath preserved me out of many eminent Dangers, when there was but a Hairs breadth between Me and Death, which I have a particular Remembrance of to this Day; and the most of them by Water. And I was brought up in the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> way till I was about thirty Years old, and had four or five Children, but Baptised none; for reading the Scriptures, and as my Age gave me
<PB N="26" REF="007622_0024_102BAB855780EC08"/>
understanding to consider what I Read. It appeared to me by the Scriptures, that we must first Believe, before we were Baptised, and in our Baptism we must be Buried in Water. And now living to this Age in the neglect of Baptism, my Conscience accused me, so that I read the Scriptures that I might be fully Informed what was for me to do. And the more I read them, I was confirmed in my first Belief, and accor∣dingly was Baptised by <HI>John Rogers,</HI> a Baptist Teacher.</P>
<P>And now as I had made a Profession thus far, and going on in my Christian Progress, I found no command in Scrip∣ture for the first day Sabbath; and therefore began to Work upon it, not thinking that the civil Authority would rise up against me. For though I was Baptised by said <HI>Rogers,</HI> and joined in Fellowship with that People that had suffered much for Conscience sake, by Whipping, Imprisoning and setting in the Stocks, and loss of Goods, and particularly, for Working on the first Day of the Week; yet of late, they had not been Molested as at the first, though they Work't as freely, and
<PB N="27" REF="007622_0025_102BAB65E5BFE508"/>
openly: but I was soon Presented, and brought before the Authority, and Fined, and then they would let me alone till after three first Day and then send for me, and Fine me, for three Days together; and now as the Battle grew hotter GOD gave me more Courage, and I grew stronger, and stronger, that what was said of Israel under the Oppression of Pharaoh, and the Egyptians was very lively with me, Exod. 1, 12. <HI>But the more they Afflicted them the more they Multiplied, and Grew;</HI> as also that of the House of Saul, and David, 2 Sam. 3, 1. <HI>Now there was long War between the House of Saul, and the House of David, but David waxed stronger, and stronger, and the House of Saul weaker, and weaker;</HI> and so it has proved be∣tween me, and the Authority, for the Consolation that I injoyed, set me over the loss of my Goods, and herein I could Witness with the Apostle, 2 Cor; 1, 5. <HI>For as the Sufferings of CHRIST Abound in us, so our Consolation also A∣boundeth by CHRIST;</HI> for GOD gave me such a chearful Spirit in this Warfare, that when I had not the Knowlege that the Grand-Jury man saw me at Work,
<PB N="28" REF="007622_0026_102BAB86DB99B838"/>
on said Day, I would Inform against my self before Witness, till they gave out, and let me Plow, and Cart, and do whatsoever I have occasion to this Day, and to this my Brethren can Witness, according to their Faith, as saith the Apostle, 1 John 5, 4 <HI>What∣soever is Born of GOD overcometh the World, and this is the Victory that over∣cometh the World; even our Faith,</HI> and in this are we GOD's Wit∣nesses, Isaiah 44, 8. <HI>Ye are even my Witnesses. Is there any God besides ME? yea there is no God, I know not any.</HI> And herein have we had GOD's Testimony, on our behalf, through the Answer of a good Conscience, and Gift of the Holy Ghost, in bearing Witness against your Scriptureless Sabbath. And now we Call for your Witness, as in Chap. 43, 9. <HI>Let them bring forth their Witnesses, that they may be Justified, or let them hear, and say it is Truth;</HI> or else be Convicted by the Prophet, Chap. 44, 9. <HI>They are their own Wit∣nesses, they see not nor know that they may be Ashamed.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Concerning the Sabbath, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>In your Confessions Chapter 22. 7 Paragraph, you say,—<HI>So by His Word in a positive moral, and perpetual Commandment, binding all Men in all Ages, He hath particularly appointed one day in seven for a Sabbath to be kept Holy unto Him, which from the begin∣ning of the World to the Resurrection of</HI> CHRIST, (you say) <HI>was the last day of the Week, and from the Resurrection of</HI> CHRIST (you say) <HI>was changed into the first day of the Week, which in Scripture</HI> (you also say) <HI>is called the Lord's-Day.</HI></P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>Whereas you say, <HI>So by His Word in a positive, moral and perpetual Command∣ment, binding all Men, in all Ages, He hath particularly appointed one day in seven for a Sabbath to be kept Holy unto Him,</HI> &amp;c. This is making GOD's Com∣mandment of none Effect, which saith Expresly, Exod. 20.9, 10. <HI>Six Days shalt thou Labour, and do all thy Work, but the seventh Day is the Sabbath of the LORD thy GOD, in it thou
<PB N="30" REF="007622_0028_102BAB88D81E1668"/>
shalt not do any Work,</HI> &amp;c. But you open a Door of Liberty for every Man to Chuse which Day of the Se∣ven he will keep for a Sabbath, and then set up your own Choice for the first Day of the Week, without the least word in Scripture for it, and Require all Men to Conform to it.</P>
<P>Secondly, you say,—<HI>Which from the beginning of the World, to the Re∣surrection of</HI> CHRIST was the last Day of the Week.</P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>There is Evening and Morning a∣scribed to all the six Days in which GOD Created all Things, Gen. 1. But to the seventh Day when GOD had finished all His Works, there is no Evening nor Morning ascribed to it, which shews it was not reckoned with the other six Days; and as the Scriptures inform us, Man was the last thing GOD Made, or His finishing Work: so that, that Mom<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>t that GOD Breathed into his Nostrils the Breath of Life, by which he became a living Soul, he immediately
<PB N="31" REF="007622_0029_102BABC13117E6D0"/>
entered into GOD's Rest, or Sabbath, that had no Evening, or Morning as∣cribed to it, even a perpetual Rest; it was no Rest to Adam from any Work that he had done, for he had done no Work to Rest from; but it was GOD's Rest, or Sabbath, that GOD put Adam in possession of, when he was first Cre∣ated, even the Day he Blessed, and Sanctified, Chap. 2. ver. 3. <HI>And GOD Blessed the seventh Day, and Sanctified it, because that in it He had Rested from all His Work, which GOD Created and Made.</HI> And as to the length of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that Adam continued in GOD's Rest or Sabbath; the Scripture is silent, neither is it needful for us to know but to know this, that GOD Created Adam in a state of Innocency, and set him in his own Rest, and through his Disobedience was turned out of it, to Eat his Bread by the Sweat of his Face; and we Read of no weekly, or seven Day Sabbath required of Man to be Kept, till in <HI>Exod.</HI> 16. When GOD first gave Israel Manna, then he set a part the seventh Day for a Sabbath, see ver. 26. <HI>Six Days ye shall gather it, but on the seventh Day which is the Sabbath,
<PB N="32" REF="007622_0030_102BAB8BE3320E38"/>
in it there shall be none.</HI> And it is good Evidence to us, that they had not lived in the practice of keeping a seventh Day Sabbath, nor that they had any knowlege of it till now, by their Averseness to it, as in Ver. 27. <HI>And it came to pass that there went out some of the People on the seventh Day for to gather, and they found none.</HI> Ver. 28, 29. <HI>And the Lord said unto Moses, how long refuse ye to keep my Command∣ments and my Laws: See for that the Lord hath given you the Sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth Day, the Bread of two Days; abide ye every Man in his place, let no Man go out of his place on the seventh Day.</HI> And for a final Confirmation, let us take <HI>Moses</HI>'s Testimony, Deut. 5.2, 3. <HI>The Lord our God made a Covenant with us in Horeb, the Lord made not this Cove∣nant with our Fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this Day.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is sufficiently Proved that GOD's Church had no six Days Labour, and seventh Day Sabbath given them to be observed, till it was given by
<PB N="33" REF="007622_0031_102BABC3B38894C8"/>
<HI>Moses,</HI> which by Scripture Date was 2513 Years after the beginning of the World.</P>
<P>And as to your Scripture Proof, Exod. 20, 8, to 11. <HI>Remember the Sabbath-Day, to keep it Holy, six Days shalt thou La∣bour, and do all thy Work, but the se∣venth Day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou shalt not do any Work, Thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, thy Man-Servant, nor thy Maid-Servant, nor thy Cattle, nor thy Stranger that is within thy Gates, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In the 16th Chap. we read only of their being forbidden to gather <HI>Manna</HI> on the seventh Day, or Sabbath; but now in this Text all manner of Labour is expresly forbidden; and the Reason is given, in Ver, 11. <HI>For in six Days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the Sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh Day, wherefore the Lord Bles∣sed the Sabbath Day and hallowed it.</HI></P>
<P>Here we see <HI>Moses</HI> in Establishing the seventh Day Sabbath to <HI>Israel,</HI> puts them in mind how that in six Days the Lord made Heaven and Earth, the
<PB N="34" REF="007622_0032_102BAB8D64F00248"/>
Sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh Day; wherefore (saith he) the Lord Blessed the Sabbath Day and Hallowed it.</P>
<P>And in this Blessed and Sanctified Day of GOD's Rest it was, that <HI>Adam</HI>'s Happiness consisted, so long as he con∣tinued in Innocency, but he for his Transgression was turned out of it, to eat his Bread by the Sweat of his Face: and this Blessed Day of Pleasure and Delight, was turned into a Cursed Day of Labour and Sorrow, not to <HI>Adam</HI> only, but to all his Posterity descending by natural Generation. And in this state of Labour and Sorrow it was that <HI>Israel</HI> underwent their Bondage in <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us consider the Reason given here for observing the Sabbath, with that in Deut. 5.15. <HI>And Remember that thou wast a Servant in the Land of</HI> Egypt, <HI>and that the Lord thy God brought thee out thence, through a mighty Hand, and by a stretched out Arm; therefore the Lord thy God Commanded thee to keep the Sabbath Day.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="007622_0033_102BABC6691019A8"/>
Thus we see the seventh Day Sabbath was Commanded to <HI>Israel;</HI> not only in Remembrance of the happy State that <HI>Adam</HI> stood in whilst in Innocency, before his Transgression; but also in Remem∣brance of their Servitude in Egypt, and of GOD's Delivering them by His Mighty Hand, and Stretched out Arm, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And in Exod. 31.12, 13. <HI>And the Lord spake unto Moses saying, speak thou unto the Children of Israel, saying, verily my Sabbaths ye shall keep, for it is a Sign between me, and you, throughout your Generations; that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth Sanctify you.</HI> Also, Ezek. 20.12. <HI>Moreover also I gave them my Sabbaths to be a Sign between me, and them, that they might know that I am the</HI> LORD <HI>that Sanctify them.</HI> Here we may see, by comparing these Texts that <HI>Moses</HI> first puts <HI>Israel</HI> in mind of the Day of GOD's Rest from His Works of Creation, which He Blessed and Sanctified, which <HI>Adams</HI> Happiness consisted in, so long as he continued in Innocency.</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="007622_0034_102BAB90B2594840"/>
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Of <HI>Israels</HI> Bondage in Egypt, and of GOD's Delivering them, as afore∣said.—</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That the LORD gave them the seventh Day Sabbath to keep as a Sign of GOD's bringing His Church and People into His seventh Day Rest, or Sabbath again, which had no Evening, or Morning ascribed to it; or into His everlasting Rest, which <HI>Adam</HI> for his Transgression was dispossessed of: and of this Rest or Sabbath, all the Faithful were Witnesses, from <HI>Adam</HI> till <HI>Moses;</HI> as CHRIST Testifieth, John 8.56. <HI>Your Father Abraham Rejoiced to see my Day, and he saw it and was glad:</HI> That was through Faith he believed in the Promises as really as if he had seen them Fulfilled, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.17, 18, 19. And this is the Sabbath or Rest, that every Child of GOD has to Labour to En∣ter into; as saith the Apostle, Chap. 4.11. <HI>Let us Labour therefore to enter into that Rest, lest any Man Fail after the same example of unbelief:</HI> That is as <HI>Israel</HI> who through unbelief, <HI>Numb.</HI> 14. Entered not into the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> but perished in the Wilderness. Here the
<PB N="37" REF="007622_0035_102BABC7EBBB2508"/>
Apostle warns us by their Example, as also, 1 Cor. 10, 11. <HI>Now all these Things happened unto them,</HI> saith he, <HI>for Ensam∣ples, and they are written for our Admo∣nition upon whom the ends of the World are come.</HI> And as the observing those Signs and Shadows under the Law were no Instruction to <HI>Israel;</HI> but as they saw the Mystery they held forth, so to us they are useless, because we are come to the Substance of what they Contained, Gal. 3.24, 25, 26. <HI>Wherefore</HI> (saith the Apostle,) <HI>the Law was our School-Master to bring us unto Christ, that we might be justified by Faith, but after that Faith is come we are no longer under a School-Master, for ye are all the Children of God by Faith in Christ Jesus.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> You say, and from the Re∣surrection of CHRIST was changed into the first Day of the Week, and for Proof quote Acts 20.7. <HI>And upon the first day of the Week when the Disciples came together to break Bread, Paul Preached unto them ready to depart on the Morrow, and continued his Speech until Midnight.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="007622_0036_102BAB926FC537B0"/>
Now let us take your Advice, as in your Confessions; Chap. 1. 9 Para∣graph, you say; <HI>The infallible Rule of Interpretation of Scripture, is the Scrip∣ture it Self,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now in as much as there is no Pre-eminence given to the Day; but called the first Day of the Week, not Sabbath Day; and that their coming together was to break Bread: <HI>Paul Preached unto them,</HI> &amp;c. I see no further Interpretation of this text of Scripture, than that their coming toge∣ther to break Bread, was in a Christian Fellowship of Love; except it might be a more general Thing at this Time, <HI>Paul</HI> being there, and ready to depart on the Morrow, and to this it Agrees with other texts of Scripture, as in Chap. 2. 42. <HI>And they continued Sted∣fast in the Apostles Doctrine, and in Fellowship, and in breaking of Bread, and in Prayers,</HI> ver. 46. <HI>And they con∣tinuing Daily with one Accord in the Temple, and in breaking Bread from House to House, did eat their Meat with gladness, and singleness of Heart;</HI> as also Jude 12. <HI>These are spots, in your feasts
<PB N="39" REF="007622_0037_102BABCB2DBC2140"/>
of Charity, when they Feast with You,</HI> &amp;c. So that from this text ot Scripture you have no proof of the Sabbath, being Changed from the seventh Day, to the first Day of the Week; in as much as there is not the Word Sabbath used, nor any thing leading thereunto, neither now, nor before this Time; and as to your other proof Gen. 2 2. <HI>And on the seventh Day</HI> GOD <HI>ended all His Work, which He had Made, and Rested on the seventh Day, from all His Work, which He had Made,</HI> &amp;c. This Text only speaks of GOD's Resting on the seventh Day from all His Work, that is to say, from His Work of Creation; and is there∣fore no Proof for your first Days Sabbath; you also Quote, 1 Cor. 6.1, 2. <HI>Dare any of you having a Matter against another go to Law before the Unjust, and not before the Saints; do ye not know that the Saints shall Judge the World? and if the World shall be Judged by You, are ye unworthy to Judge the smallest Matters?</HI> &amp;c. Here the Apostle is not speaking any thing concerning a Sabbath; but blames the Church for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eir Contentions, and going to Law before the unjust or worldly Judges,
<PB N="40" REF="007622_0038_102BAB93F1F1BC70"/>
compar'd with ver. 6. <HI>But Brother goeth to Law with Brother, and that before the Unbelievers.</HI></P>
<P>Now, whereas you Quote, <HI>Rev.</HI> 1, 10. And say upon it, which in Scripture is called the Lord's-Day, and apply it to prove your first Day Sabbath. I desire to know from what text of Scripture, you prove that the Title Lord's-Day is given to the first Day of the Week, more than any other Day; or that any particular Day of the Week is intended by it? Psal. 74.16. We read, <HI>The Day is Thine, the Night also is Thine.</HI> Jer 5.2. Saith, <HI>And tho' they say the Lord liveth, surely they Sware falsely.</HI> Now they had Scripture enough to prove that the LORD lived, but they had not the Witness in themselves; and therefore their Witness was not True. And for you to set up the first Day of the Week for a Sabbath; and then say which in Scripture is called the LORD's Day, without any Proof from the Text, or any other Place of Scrip∣ture, is a false Assertion of your own; and wresting the Scriptures to your own Destruction. 2 <HI>Pet.</HI> 3.16. Yea it is
<PB N="41" REF="007622_0039_102BABCDAC3BD658"/>
a Secret that doth not belong to us to know, till GOD reveals it: Deut. 29.29. <HI>The secret Things belong unto the Lord our God; but those Things that are Revealed belong unto us, and to our Children for Ever, that we may do all the Words of this Law.</HI> Yea, it is adding to the Text, which we are for∣bidden, Chap. 4.2. <HI>Ye shall not add unto the Word which I Command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it.</HI> Also Chap. 12.32. And saith the A∣postle, Rev. Chap. 22.18. <HI>For I Tes∣tifie unto every Man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this Book; if any Man shall add unto these Things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this Book,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The words in the Text are these; <HI>I was in the Spirit on the LORD's Day,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>In the Explanation of any Text of Scripture, it is safe first to consider the Occasion of its being Spoken, so to inform our Understanding, and to deliver it in as plain Words as we can, without the least Inclination either to Add, or to Diminish. And so with
<PB N="42" REF="007622_0040_102BAB97C82FB400"/>
your Advice, <HI>That the infallible Rule of In∣terpretation of Scripture, is the Scripture it self.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed to prove, that the word Day, in Scripture, is not always to be limited to any particular Day in the Week, but the present Time: As in Psal. 95.7. <HI>To day if you will hear his voice, &amp;c.</HI> Ver. 8. <HI>Harden not your hearts, as in the provoca∣tion; and as in the day of temptation in the wilderness;</HI> compar'd with ver. 10. <HI>Forty years long was I grieved with this genera∣tion, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>This Text informs us, that the Day here spoken of, contained the Children of <HI>Israel</HI>'s Forty Years Travel in the Wilderness: Also Psal. 118.22, 23, 24. <HI>The Stone which the Builders refused is become the head stone of the Corner; this is the LORD'S Doing, it is mar∣vellous in our Eyes: This is the Day which the</HI> LORD <HI>hath made, we will rejoice, and be glad in it.</HI></P>
<P>Here is the word Day used, to set forth GOD'S great Goodness to <HI>David,</HI> and to his Church, in destroying their Enemies, and establishing him on the Throne of his Kingdom. A Day which cannot be ascri∣bed to one single Day, or to any particular
<PB N="43" REF="007622_0041_102BABCFF0DA8010"/>
Day of the Week; but to that present Time wherein they enjoyed the Mercy there spoken of. As also 2 Cor. 6.2. <HI>For I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of salvation have I succoured thee: Behold, now is the accepted time, behold now is the day of salvation.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we see, the Text has no reference to any particular Day of the Week; but the present Time.</P>
<P>To conclude with the words of the Text, <HI>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, &amp;c.</HI> is as much as if the Apostle had said, I was in the Spirit, or Spiritualized in the day of the LORD'S Appearing to me, and requiring me to write the Prophesies of this Book; which to our acceptation may be under∣stood, Time of the Lord's Appearing, compared with the fore cited Scriptures.</P>
<P>Thus you single out only these words of the Apostle, <HI>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's Day, &amp;c.</HI> for the proof of your First-Day Sabbath; and add to the Text, and say, <HI>Which in Scripture is called the Lord's-Day,</HI> without proof either from this Text, or any other Scripture, that the First Day of the Week was ever so intitled.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="007622_0042_102BAB994B305970"/>
You also Quote <HI>Exod.</HI> 20.8.10, to prove said Sabbath, and leave out the ninth Verse, that says, <HI>Six days shalt thou Labour, and do all thy Work:</HI> For that would have been in right Opposition to your First Day Sabbath. But your proof in the tenth Verse, is, <HI>But the seventh day is the sab∣bath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shalt not do any Work, thou, nor thy Son, nor thy Daughter, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Thus you bring the express Command For the Seventh Day Sabbath, to prove your First Day Sabbath; and in so doing break God's Commandment in a Two∣fold Sense.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> You command Rest on the Day that He commanded Labour.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> You Labour on the Day that He commanded Rest.</P>
<P>And herein you also go contrary to the command of the Angel of the Lord, and of Christ himself, <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.7.10. who both commanded the Disciples to Labour, by Travelling on the First Day of the Week, being the Day of Christ's Resurrection. And for us to do the like, would be more Exemplary, than to command, and do contrary.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="007622_0043_102BABD1F85F7908"/>
There remains more of your proofs that I have not spoken to; but they are so far from proving any Command for your First Day Sabbath, that they inform us of no Example, Name, nor the least Breath lead∣ing thereunto. And the Apostle saith, Rom. 4.15. <HI>Where no law is there is no transgression,</HI> Also Chap. 5. 13. <HI>Sin is not imputed where there is no Law.</HI></P>
<P>And now <HI>Connecticut,</HI> I turn your own Words back upon your selves. Page 7, of your Preface you say, <HI>Believe in all divine Worship, it is not enough that this or that Act of Worship is not forbidden in the Word of God, if it be not Commanded, and you perform it, you may fear you will be found guilty, and exposed to divine Dis∣pleasure, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And also you of <HI>Boston</HI> in your pre∣face, page 4 say, <HI>To the Law, and to the Testimony, we do wholly refer our selves; and if any thing in the follow∣ing Conclusion be indeed found not to speak according thereunto let it be Rejected.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Boston Confession,</HI> by its Date, has been Printed more than seventy Years, what
<PB N="46" REF="007622_0044_102BAB9B56ADD110"/>
Witness has been borne against it, I know not; but the length of Time has been sufficient for them to have Peru∣sed it, and Corrected it, or Condemned it.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Connecticut Confession,</HI> it has been Printed more than forty Years, and there has been public Witness borne against it, both before the Ministers, and also be∣fore the Rulers of the common Wealth, but it was not regarded.</P>
<P>And now I speak to the Elders, and Messengers, and General Courts of both said Governments, the former as you have recommended the abovesaid Con∣fessions, the latter as you have establish∣ed them, and caused them to be Print∣ed, and use the carnal Sword to defend them, what have you to say for your selves? For as much, as you have Veri∣fied it over, and over so many times in your Confessions, that we should make the Scriptures, or the Word of GOD our rule of Life, and to that Effect, and not to take any thing upon trust as from you, and say, in Chap. 21. 1, 2, Paragraph, <HI>GOD alone is LORD of the Conscience, and hath left it free from
<PB N="47" REF="007622_0045_102BABD45410C3B8"/>
the Doctrines, and Commandments of Men, which are in any thing contrary to His Word, or not contained in it, so that to believe such Doctrines, or to obey such Commands out of Conscience, is to betray true liberty of Conscience, and the re∣quiring of an implicit Faith, and an absolute, and blind Obedience, is to de∣stroy liberty of Conscience, and Reason al∣so.</HI></P>
<P>I say, what have you to say for your selves in Defence of your first day Sab∣bath? that has neither command, nor example, nor name, nor the least breath, or title in Scripture for it; but express Commands to the contrary, both in the old, and new Testament.</P>
<P>And whereas you say, <HI>GOD alone is LORD of the Conscience, &amp;c.</HI> How do you Prove it? where are your Wit∣nesses? you only give Him the Title of LORD, but take the ruling power of Lordship to your selves, to rule over Conscience; and so with your carnal Weapons, as Stocks, Whips, Fines, and Imprisonments, and the like, to Persecute CHRIST in His Members, that for

Conscience sake cannot conform to your institutions of Worship; they are so contrary to Scripture, that they cannot both be obeyed: As CHRIST saith, <HI>No Man can serve two Masters, &amp;c.</HI> Matth. 6, 24. Yet you presumptuously require Obedience to your own Institu∣tions, against Scripture, against Consci∣ence, and against your own Counsels, page 5. 6. in <HI>Connecticut Preface;</HI> and why is all this? it is for the sake of a little honour, and friendship of this World, as saith CHRIST, John 5, 44. <HI>How can ye believe which receive honour one of another, and seek not the honour that cometh from</HI> God <HI>only?</HI> Thus CHRIST sets it forth as a thing imposlible to be∣lieve in GOD, whilst we are seeking Honour one of another; and James 4.4. saith, <HI>Ye adulterers, and adulteresses, know ye not that the friendship of the World, if enmity with</HI> GOD? <HI>whosoever there∣fore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of</HI> GOD; that is, to be in friend∣ship with the spirit of the World, makes us enemies to God: And most cer∣tainly, you are twisted together in the honour, and friendship of the World, un∣der a shew of Godliness: But by your

I will raise them up a Prophet from among their Brethren like unto thee, and I will put my Words in his Mouth, and he shall speak unto them, all that I shall Com∣mand him, and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my Words, which he shall speak in my Name, I will require it of him.</HI> Matth. 17, 5. <HI>While He yet spake behold a bright Cloud over∣shadowed them, and behold a Voice out of
<PB N="50" REF="007622_0048_102BABA08BD27570"/>
the Cloud, which said, This is my be∣loved Son in whom I am well pleased, hear ye Him.</HI></P>
<P>So now let us hear your New Tes∣tament Proofs, Matth. 5.34, 35, 36, <HI>But I say unto you, Swear not at all, neither by Heaven for it is</HI> GOD<HI>'s Throne; nor by the Earth for it is His Foot-stool; neither by Jerusalem, for it is the City of the Great King; neither shalt thou Swear by thy Head, because thou canst not make one Hair white or black.</HI> Jam. 5.12. <HI>But above all things, my Bre∣thren, swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth, neither by any other Oath, but let your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay, lest you full into Condemnation.</HI></P>
<P>Here is full, and express Commands from CHRIST, and His Apostle, that forbids us all manner of Swearing whatsoever: But you say, <HI>A lawful Oath is a part of religious Worship, &amp;c. And to refuse an Oath is Sin,</HI> in your 3d Paragraph.</P>
<P>Now who shall we obey, Christ or you? we cannot Obey both; because CHRIST forbids us doing that, that you say, is a part of religious Worship, and Sin if we refuse it, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And to bring Scrip∣tures to confute you, that go so directly
<PB N="51" REF="007622_0049_102BABD886DA16E0"/>
against the express Commandments of GOD, and of CHRIST in the Scrip∣tures, is altogether superfluous, and would be but as casting Pearls before Swine, which CHRIST hath Forbidden us. I shall therefore conclude, with this Arti∣cle as sufficiently Confuted, by your own Scripture Proofs, and so leave it to the Judgment of the Reader.</P>

<HEAD>Concerning Baptism.</HEAD>
<P>Chap. 29. 3d Paragraph, you say, <HI>Dipping of the Person into the Water is not necessary, but Baptism is rightly ad∣ministred by pouring, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> sprinkling Water upon the Person.</HI> For which you Quote divers Scriptures, but they are nothing to the purpose.</P>
<P>I shall therefore omit them, and Prove the contrary, both as it was Administred in the Figure in the Time of the old Testament; and also as it was practiced in the New. Exod. 14.22. <HI>And the Children of Israel went into the midst of the Sea, upon the dry Ground, and the Waters were a wall unto them on the right hand, and on the left;</HI> Compared with 1 Cor. 10.1, 2. <HI>Moreover, brethren,
<PB N="52" REF="007622_0050_102BABA20D064A20"/>
I would not that ye should be ignorant, how that all our Fathers were under the Cloud, and all passed through the Sea, and were all Baptized unto Moses in the Cloud, and in the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>Here we see, as all Israel were under the Cloud, and passed through the Sea, that was a Wall on their right Hand, and on their left; the Apostle calls it Baptism, or being Baptized unto <HI>Moses,</HI> saith he, <HI>in the Cloud and in the Sea;</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doth not apply Baptism, to the Water only, as it was a Wall on their right Hand, and on their left, but to the Cloud also, as it was over them, which shews forth a Burying; and Matth. 3.13, we Read, <HI>Then cometh</HI> JESUS <HI>from Galilee to Jordan, unto John to be Bap∣tised of him.</HI> ver. 16. <HI>And</HI> JESUS <HI>when He was Baptized, went up straitway out of the Water.</HI> Mark 1.9, 10. <HI>And it came to pass in those Days, that</HI> JESUS <HI>came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was Baptized of John in Jordan, and straight∣ly coming up out of the Water,</HI> &amp;c. Here is two Scripture Records, that in∣form us that CHRIST was Baptized in <HI>Jordan,</HI> and that He came up out of the Water. What did He go down
<PB N="53" REF="007622_0051_102BABDC84E0B010"/>
into the Water for, but to be buried in Baptism? and do you say, this manner of Administration of Baptism is not ne∣cessary, which CHRIST Himself hath given us a Pattern by His own Exam∣ple, and saith thus, <HI>It becometh us to fulfill all Righteousness:</HI> And in stead hereof set up a Tradition of your own, and say, <HI>Baptism is rightly administred by pouring, or sprinkling Water upon the Person.</HI> Thus you make void CHRIST'S Pattern, and Example, and establish your own Tradition. Read also, Acts 8.38, 39. <HI>And they went down both into the Water, both Philip, and the Eunuch, and he Baptized him, and when they were come up out of the Water, &amp;c.</HI> It had no need to be said, that they went both down into the Water, and when they were come up out of the Water, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> It <HI>Philip</HI> by taking a little Water in his Hand and administring it by pouring, or sprinkling it on the Eunuch, would have been accepted for Baptism.</P>
<P>Rom. 6, 3. <HI>Know ye not, that so many of us as were Baptized into</HI> JESUS CHRIST, <HI>were Baptized into His Death.</HI> ver. 4. <HI>Therefore we are Buried with Him by Baptism unto Death,</HI> saith the
<PB N="54" REF="007622_0052_102BABA4CB35A100"/>
Apostle, that is, <HI>into the likeness of His Death, and Burial,</HI> to shew forth the death, and burial of the body of Sin in us; and further saith he, <HI>That like as</HI> CHRIST <HI>was raised up from the Dead, by the Glory of the Father, even so also, we should walk in newness of Life;</HI> that is, as we are quickned by the power of His Resurrection; ver. 5. <HI>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of His Death, we shall be also in the likeness of His Resurrection.</HI> Col. 2.12. <HI>Buried with Him in Baptism, where∣in also you are risen with Him through the Faith of the operation of</HI> God, <HI>who hath raised Him from the Dead.</HI> By this Text the Apostle shews that as we are Buried with CHRIST in Baptism, so we are also Risen with Him to newness of Life; and not only this, but we bare an open Testimony to the World, of our Faith in His Death, and Resurrection. But pouring, or sprinkling Water upon the Person, bares no name in Scripture re∣lating to Baptism, and is a Worshipping you know not what: Or as CHRIST saith, Matth 15.9. <HI>But in vain do they Worship me, teaching for Doctrines the Com∣mandments of Men.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="007622_0053_102BABDA0A1010A8"/>
Neither have you any Scripture for the Baptizing Infants, as you call it, but it is an Invention of your own, to pretend to Baptize those that have no Knowlege, neither of Good, or Evil. Deut. 1, 39. <HI>Moreover your little ones which ye said should be a prey, and your Chil∣dren which in that day had no knowlege between good and Evil,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that your Baptism is made up with Contradictions of Scrip∣ture: And in the Administring it you say, <HI>I Baptize thee in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost;</HI> which is a Lie both to GOD and Man: Neither do I see it to be less than Blasphemy; for the Spirit of GOD and the Scriptures agree in one: For saith the Apostle, 2 Pet. 1.21. <HI>The Prophecy came not in old Time by the will of Man, but holy Men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.</HI> 1 Cor. 12.3. <HI>No man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>And for you to take God's Name to Witness to that is so contrary to the Scriptures, we may safely believe it to be by the spirit of Antichrist; and therefore a lie, as to what you pretend.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="007622_0054_102BABA6BA674B40"/>
Here I conclude with your own Words, Chap. 22. Paragraph 1. <HI>But the acceptable way of Worshipping the true God is Institu∣ted by Himself, and so limited by his own Revealed Will, that he may not be Wor∣shipped according to the Imaginations, and Devices of Men, or the suggestions of Satan, under any visible Representations, or any other way not prescribed in the Holy Scrip∣tures.</HI></P>

<HEAD>Concerning the Civil Government,</HEAD>
<P>As it is the Ordinance of GOD, Rom. 13.1, 2 <HI>Let every soul be subject unto the higher Powers, for there is no Power but of God: the Powers that be are Ordained of God; whosoever therefore resisteth the Pow∣er, resisteth the Ordinance of God, and they that resist, shall receive to themselves damna∣tion,</HI> &amp;c. Ver. 5, 6. <HI>Wherefore, ye must needs be subject, not only for Wrath, but also for Conscience sake: for, for this Cause pay <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Tribute also; for they are God's Mi∣nisters,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And herein we have Christ's Example, who paid Tribute, rather than to offend them, <HI>Matth.</HI> 17.25, 26, 27. And from this Example of CHRIST, the Apostle
<PB N="57" REF="007622_0055_102BABDE8AAA87A0"/>
seems to Exhort the Church, 1 Pet. 2.13, 14 <HI>Submit your selves,</HI> saith he, <HI>to every Ordi∣nance of Man for the Lord's sake; whether it be to the King as supreme, or unto Go∣vernors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evil doers, and for the praise of them that do well; for so is the Will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men: as free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of Maliciousness, but as the servants of God.</HI></P>
<P>The Apostle seems to speak in the same manner with CHRIST, who said, <HI>Lest we should Offend them;</HI> that is, as Sojourners in their Kingdom, to do it for Peace sake, rather than to Offend them; and not as a due Debt.</P>
<P>And whereas the Apostle saith, <HI>As free, and not using your Liberty for a Cloke of Maliciousness; but as the Servants of God:</HI> that is, to do it Chearfully, not Grudg∣ingly; but in a free Spirit. Read Tit. 3.1. <HI>Put them in mind to be subject to Principalities and Powers, to obey Ma∣gistrates, to be ready to every good Work, &amp;c.</HI> That is, necessary Works for the public Good, but nothing relating to Conscience or Godliness: For the civil Government then had not received the
<PB N="58" REF="007622_0056_102BABA9969D7978"/>
Christian Faith; but were Idolaters, and Worshipped Idols.</P>
<P>And under this same Government, being the Roman Government, the Church suf∣fered Persecution the first Three Hundred Years after Christ, in the Time of the Ten Persecutions, as we are informed by <HI>Church History.</HI> Yea, the Apostles them∣selves were put to Death, and an innu∣merable multitude of Christians in this Time, for Conscience, or Christ's sake; which is sufficient F<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>idenee, that the A∣postle's Exhortations to Christians, to be subject to the higher Powers, was only in Temporal Things, and nothing con∣cerning Conscience.</P>
<P>So that from these Texts, there is no Inlargement for any Rulers of the Com∣mon Wealth to Exercise any Authority over any man's Conscience; neither have we the least Word in all the New Testa∣ment, to encourage Christians for Help that way: but all on the contrary. As in Mat. 10.18. saith Christ, <HI>And ye shall be brought before Governors and Kings for my sake for a Testimony against them, and the Gentiles.</HI></P>
<P>And it is the run of the New Testa∣ment, that a Suffering Life is marked out
<PB N="59" REF="007622_0057_102BABE0901E86A0"/>
for a Christian's Life. And as the Chil∣dren of GOD are said to be Strangers, and Pilgrims in the World, so it is the Will of GOD, that they should live a Peace∣able and Quiet Life, in all Places where GOD is pleased to call them. But in the case of Conscience, we must Obey GOD rather than Man. And we are Exhorted to Contend Earnestly for the Faith, and not to Fear them that Kill the Body, <HI>&amp;c. Mat.</HI> 10.28.</P>
<P>But civil Rulers, not being contented in the Place that God hath set them in through the Pride of their own Hearts, and Malice of Satan, usurp Authority to Rule in Church Affairs also; and to Ex∣ercise Lordship over Men's Consciences: Whereas the Prophet Isaiah, Chap. 33.22. saith, <HI>The LORD is our Judge, the LORD is our Lawgiver, the LORD is our King,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But if we sit in his Seat of Judgment, to Judge, how is He a Judge? And if we Exercise our selves in His Place of Lordship, how is He a Lord? And if we set up our Authority to Rule over His Church, which is His Kingdom, how then is He a King? For saith Christ, Luk. 17.20, 21. <HI>The Kingdom of GOD cometh
<PB N="60" REF="007622_0058_102BABAB928B21A0"/>
not with Observation,&amp;c.</HI> Or as we may say, not by observing outward Rules. For behold saith he, <HI>The Kingdom of God is within you.</HI> That is by the Re∣velation of GOD's Spirit in our Hearts, which is out of Man's Sight to Judge of.</P>
<P>Thus it is sufficiently Proved that GOD hath set up the civil Government to Rule in the common Wealth, in Temporal things; and as well Proved that he hath not committed unto them the Government of His Church; and His Revealed Will in Men's Consci∣ences, which is a Secret, know only by GOD, and to him to whom GOD is pleased to Reveal it, Rev. 2.17. <HI>He that hath an ear let him hear, what the Spirit saith unto the Churches; to him that over cometh will I give to eat of the hidden Manna; and I will give him a white Stone, and in the Stone, a new Name written which no Man know∣eth saving he that receiveth it.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have Proved that the civil Government as they exercise their Au∣thority to Rule only in Temporal things
<PB N="61" REF="007622_0059_102B86D8C64F3430"/>
are the Ministers of GOD, and that GOD hath not committed to them the Government of His Church, or to med∣dle in cases of Conscience.</P>
<P>And now I speak to you Elders, and Messengers; as you have Recom∣mended your Confessions of Faith; and to you Rulers of the common Wealth, as you have acknowleged them, and published them, and established them by Law, and defend them by the carnal Sword, I speak I say to both Parties as One, as you are in Fellowship with each other in these Things, and so proceed to prove that your exercising your Selves in the affairs of Conscience, and matters of Faith towards GOD, you do it under the authority of the Dragon, or spirit of Antichrist. Rev. 13.1, 2, 3. <HI>And I stood upon the sand of the Sea, and saw a Beast rise up out of the Sea having seven Heads, and ten Horns; and upon his Horns ten Crowns, and upon his Heads the name of Blasphemy: And the Beast which I saw was like unto a Leopard, and his Feet were as the Feet of a Bear, and his Mouth as the Mouth of
<PB N="62" REF="007622_0060_102BABAD153922D0"/>
a Lion: And the Dragon gave him his Power, and his Seat, and great Authority.</HI></P>
<P>Now as hath been said, the power, and authority of the civil Government is of GOD, to execute justice, and equi∣ty among Men; and the civil Govern∣ment as it was Represented to <HI>John</HI> by a Beast rising up out of the Sea, or multitude of People, as in Chap. 17. 15. had this power, and authority given them of GOD, before that of the Dragon's, as it is set forth by the Beast, having <HI>seven Heads, and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten Crowns:</HI> So that it is very clear, and evident that the power, seat, and authority given by the Dragon was an additional power, not from GOD, but of his own Nature, a persecuting Power, readily imbraced by the Rulers of the common Wealth, for the sake of the glory, honor, and friendship of this World; and this power, and glory he offered to CHRIST, Luke 4, 5, 6, but CHRIST did not accept of it, but we see the Beast, or worldly Pow∣ers did accept of it, in that they put it in Practice. <HI>And I saw one of his
<PB N="63" REF="007622_0061_102BABE5DDA79168"/>
Heads as it were wounded to Death, and his deadly Wound was healed.</HI> By the Beast the Apostle here saw rise up out of the Sea, having <HI>seven Heads, and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten Crowns,</HI> &amp;c. We are to understand the worldly Pow∣ers, or Rulers that GOD hath set up to Govern the World, or common Wealth, whether Kings, Governors, or those of lower Degrees, compared with the following part of Rev. 13, and more Particularly the 7 ver. <HI>And it was given unto him to make War with the Saints, and to over-come them, and power was given him over all Kindreds, and Tongues and Nations.</HI> And by the Dragon is to be understood the Devil, or Satan, as in Chap. 12, 9. <HI>And the great Dragon was cast out, that old Ser∣pent called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole World,</HI> &amp;c. And whereas it is said the <HI>Dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and great Au∣thority;</HI> this is to be understood by stirring up the powers of this World, by the spirit of Persecution, to turn the Sword that GOD had put into their Hands to execute justice among Men, to persecute the Saints, as in Chap. 12, 7.
<PB N="64" REF="007622_0062_102BABAF5A596068"/>
<HI>And there was war in Heaven, Michael and his Angels fought against the Dragon, and the Dragon fought and his Angels.</HI> Now though the Devil be said, to be a Murderer from the beginning, as in John 8, 44. <HI>Y<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are of your father the Devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do; he was a Murderer from the begining.</HI> Yet I understand the War here spoken of, between <HI>Michael</HI> and his Angels; and the <HI>Dragon</HI> and his Angels, to intend more particularly the time of the ten Persecutions, under the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors in defence of their <HI>Heathenish</HI> Idolatrous Worship, which said War by the Saints was not carried on by carnal Weapons; as we may see Chap. 12.11. <HI>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their Testimony; and they loved not their lives unto the Death:</HI> But in the End, the prevailing of the light of the Gospel, and the Sword of <HI>Con∣stantine,</HI> became the Overthrow of that persecuting Power, and the wounding that head, or power of the Beast, re∣ceived from the Dragon, by which he became a persecuting Power; and by the spreading of the Gospel among the
<PB N="65" REF="007622_0063_102BABE7DF4D0020"/>
Gentiles, according to what is spoken, Isa. 11.9. <HI>They shall not hurt nor de∣stroy in all my holy Mountain; for the Earth shall be full of the knowlege of the LORD as the Waters cover the Sea.</HI></P>
<P>This was a prophecy of the Gentiles receiving the knowlege of GOD by preaching the Gospel unto them: For we receive the knowlege of GOD, and of the mysteries or Godliness no other way but by the Gospel, and by our know∣lege of GOD, and of the mysteries of Godliness in and by the Gospel; the mystery of Iniquity is also discovered, and the discovering the mystery of Ini∣quity in the time of <HI>Heathenism,</HI> and their worshipping of Idols, to be a de∣lusion or a work of Satan, was the wounding as unto Death, as the Apostle saith, that head or power given to the Beast, by the Dragon and by the Sword in the hand of <HI>Constantine,</HI> GOD executed His Judgments upon the <HI>Roman</HI> Pers;e∣cuting Power to their utter overthrow, and deliverance of His Church out of their persecuting Hands.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="007622_0064_102BABB295FD6118"/>
Thus we are come to the end of Persecution, under <HI>Heathenism,</HI> or the <HI>Gentiles</HI> opposing the Christian Faith, and the wounding the Beasts Head, or persecuting Power given him by the Dragon.</P>
<P>The next thing to understand is, how his wounded Head was healed; which will appear by reading and comparing the following part of Rev. 13. ver. 11, 12, &amp;c. <HI>And I beheld another Beast Coming up out of the Earth, and he had two Horns like a Lamb, and he spake as a Dragon, and he exerciseth all the power of the firs;t Beast before him, and causeth the Earth and them which dwell therein, to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed.</HI> The Apostle calls this another Beast to distinguish it from the Beast mentioned in ver. first, that rose up out of the Sea, <HI>having seven Heads, and ten Horns, and upon his Horns ten Crowns,</HI> &amp;c. Which shews the perfection of the Power that GOD had given him to govern the common Wealth; as in Chap. 12. 3. The Dragon is described to have seven Heads and ten Horns, and seven Crowns upon his Heads: This is also to shew
<PB N="67" REF="007622_0065_102BABE9DEEBD908"/>
the perfection of his Power; and the Dragon giving the said Beast his Power and his Seat, and great Authority; and the said Beast or worldly Powers repre∣sented by it, exercising the Power given him by the Dragon, becomes a persecu∣ting Power, not only to Rule in the common Wealth, but also in the Church, in things that relate to the worship of GOD, bringing both the common Wealth and Church under one Government, and the Beast mentioned in ver. 11 12. <HI>Coming up out of the Earth,</HI> which shews his Earthly nature that is said to have <HI>two horns like a Lamb, and to speak as a Dragon, and to exercise all the power of the first Beast before him, and to cause the Earth and them that dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed.</HI> Why this Beast was repre∣sented to <HI>John</HI> in the appearance of a Lamb, was in imitation to CHRIST, as CHRIST is set forth by the similitude of a Lamb, John 1.29. <HI>Behold the Lamb of GOD, which taketh away the Sin of the World.</HI> Rev. 5.12. <HI>Worthy is the Lamb that was Slain,</HI> &amp;c. And Abundantly in this Book CHRIST is Represented by the similitude of a Lamb;
<PB N="68" REF="007622_0066_102BABB4926993C8"/>
so that it was in Imitation to CHRIST, and His Ministers, as being sent by CHRIST, and coming in His Name: But He is said to <HI>speak as a Dragon,</HI> which shews He was a Counterfeit, or Antichrist, and did not come in a real Lamb-like Spirit, but in the Spirit of Antichrist, or false Prophets; as CHRIST foretold, Matth. 7 15. <HI>Beware of false Prophets, which come to you in Sheeps Cloathing but inwardly they are raven∣ing Wolves,</HI> And in the following Verses shews, that we shall <HI>know them by their Fruits.</HI> And why he is said to have two Horns, is to shew his exercising Authority, not only in the common Wealth, but also in the Church: ver. 13. <HI>And he doth great Wonders, so that he maketh Fire to come down from Heaven on the Earth in the sight of Men.</HI> That is, by his Ministers, by their formal and long Prayers, with seem∣ing Holiness, and many and vain Repe∣titions forbidden by CHRIST; Matth. 6.7, 8. <HI>But when ye Pray, use not vain Repetitions as the Heathen do, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking; be not ye therefore like unto them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="007622_0067_102BABEB887FA4D8"/>
Rev. 15. ver. 14. <HI>And deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth,</HI> or Earthly Men, <HI>by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast:</HI> That is to say, the first Beast, or Rulers of this World; and this is also by his Ministers in singing holy Men's Psalms in a formal custo∣mary Manner, without any quickening from GOD, being in a dead carnal State; by these and the like performances, under a shew of Godliness is intended the said Wonders and Miracles, by which carnal and earthly minded Men are Deceived.</P>
<P>And further saith the Apostle, <HI>Saying to them that dwell on the Earth, that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a Sword and did live.</HI> This is the Beast coming up out of the Earth, in ver. 11, who represents Antichrist, and and Antichris∣tian Ministers; and by what the Apostle saith, stirs up them that dwell on the Earth, or earthly Men, to make an image or form of godliness to the first Beast, as in ver. 1. <HI>Which had the wound by a Sword and did live;</HI> who represents all Antichristian Authority
<PB N="70" REF="007622_0068_102BABB6562747A8"/>
throughout the World, that exalt them∣selves over GOD's Church, to Judge in the affairs of Conscience. Ver. 15. <HI>And he had Power to give life unto the image of the Beast, that the image of the Beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the Beast should be Killed.</HI></P>
<P>In the time of the Old Testament the Images and Idols of the Heathen were dead Idols; but this Beast or Antichrist, the Apostle saith, had power to give Life unto the image of the Beast, or form of Godliness maintained and defen∣ded by the worldly Powers, that it should both Speak, and cause that as many as would not Worship the image of the Beast should be Killed. Ver. 16. <HI>And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right Hand, or in their Fore-heads.</HI> This signifies to require an active and open Acknowledgement from all Men of every Rank as the words express, to Worship, and to be Wor∣shippers of the Image, or form of God∣liness defended by the Powers of this World. Ver. 17. <HI>And that no Man
<PB N="71" REF="007622_0069_102BABEE07204B88"/>
might buy, or sell, save he that had the mark, or the name of the Beast, or the number of his name.</HI> For such an one was to have no liberty to exercise him∣self in any Church Affairs, neither to teach, nor to administer any of the Ordinances of CHRIST, or to do any thing contrary to that prescribed form of Worship, or image of the Beast; as is signified by being denied the liberty either to Buy, or Sell. Ver. 18. <HI>Here is Wisdom, let him that hath Understan∣ding count the number of the Beast, for it is the number of a Man, and his number is six Hundred, three Score, and six;</HI> yea it is Wisdom indeed to understand so as to count this Number here spoken of; for none but the Wisdom of GOD, can count this Number of the Beast, or his Worship so as to understand it: For saith the Apostle, <HI>it is the Number of a Man,</HI> and as it is the Number of a Man, it contains all Precepts, Laws, Doctrines, Ordinances, and institutions of Worship whatsoever made, and re∣quired to be observed by the command∣ments of Men, in one Kingdom, and common. Wealth after this manner, and in another after that: Yea it contains all
<PB N="72" REF="007622_0070_102BABB881761988"/>
the pretended Worship to GOD through∣out the whole World, set up by the Wisdom of Men, and by them Com∣manded to be Observed: And saith he, <HI>his Number is six Hundred, three Score, and six.</HI></P>
<P>Here we see the Apostle has Num∣berd it by the same Wisdom that he Recommends to us to Number it by; for he received it by Revelation from GOD, and none can count this Number but by the same Spirit of Revelation now GOD: And although the Apostle has Numbered it to us, yet he counsels us to Number it; for else how shall we understand it so as to escape it; as not to be entangled in it for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> concerns every private Christian to keep out of the delusion of Antichrist, one as much as another.</P>
<P>The sum of the matter is this, by the <HI>Dragon,</HI> is to be understood the Devil, Chap. 12. 9. <HI>And the great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole World;</HI> and by <HI>the Beast that rose up out of the Sea,</HI> Chap. 13. 1. is to be understood the powers of this

World, that GOD hath Ordained to govern the common Wealth; who at that time was much held under the <HI>Roman</HI> Power; and by <HI>the Beast coming up out of the Earth,</HI> ver. 11. <HI>That had two Horns like a Lamb, and spake as a Dragon,</HI> is to be understood Anti∣christ, and comprehends all false Teachers pretending to come in CHRIST's Name, and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth.</P>
<P>Saith the Apostle by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do, in the sight of the Beast, or worldly Rulers, and this came by the falling away of the Church from the Apostles Doctrine; and their first Suc∣cessors received in the purity of it. As saith CHRIST, Matth. 5. 14. <HI>Ye are the light of the World, a City that is set on a Hill cannot he hid:</HI> The light of which, that is, the light of the Church discovered the delusions of the World in the time of Heathenish Idolatry, to the wounding as unto Death that head or power of the Beast given him by the Dragon; as saith the A∣postle; but by the falling away of the Church, the light of the Gospel became
<PB N="74" REF="007622_0072_102BABBC1AD14BA0"/>
Eclipsed, and Men's understandings Dark∣ned, so that the Devil got place again in the darkness of Men's understandings to deceive them so as to believe himself to be GOD, 2 Cor. 4.4. <HI>In whom the God of this World hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,</HI> &amp;c: and the Church to be Deceivers, And the Church of Antichrist as it got place in the World to be taken for the true Church: So taking the false for the true, and the true for the false; and as the false Church, or Church of Antichrist Multi∣plied, it became Honourable in the World, so as to be received by the World, and worldly Powers: For the true Church, that is now the false Church, and World, and worldly Powers came into Fellowship together, so as to Rule not only in the common Wealth, but also in the Church, by that usur∣ped Power received from the Dragon.</P>
<P>And as is signified by the Beast, <HI>having two Horns like a Lamb, but spake as a Dragon; and is said to exercise all the Power of the first Beast,</HI> or at least that persecuting Power under <HI>Heathenism,</HI> and this is the healing of
<PB N="75" REF="007622_0073_102BABF276B19640"/>
that head, or persecuting Power of the Beast received from the Dragon; that is to say, now in the time of <HI>Anti∣christianism,</HI> and as those Idols of the <HI>Heathen</HI> in the time of the Law were dead Idols. Psalm 115.4, 5, 6, 7. <HI>Their Idols are Silver and Gold, the work of Men's Hands, they have Mouths but they speak not, Eyes have they but they see not, they have Ears but they hear not, Noses have they but they smell not, they have Hands but they handle not, Feet have they but they walk not, neither speak they through their Throat,</HI> Psalm 135.15, 16, 17. <HI>The Idols of the Heathen are Silver and Gold, the work of Men's Hands,</HI> &amp;c. So that the Worshippers of them could ascribe no Glory, or Praise to them any further, than they were the work of their own Hands.</P>
<P>But here it is said, <HI>the Beast that came up out of the Earth having two Horns like a Lamb, and spake as a Dragon, had power to give Life unto the image of the Beast,</HI> or form of Godliness; that it should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the said Beast,
<PB N="76" REF="007622_0074_102BABBD9DD54C70"/>
should be Killed; appearing in as great Authority as <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> who saw no Power above himself, and gave the like Sentence.</P>
<P>For as this Beast by his two Horns was a representation of Antichrist, and Antichristian Ministers joyning together in Fellowship and Worship with the Powers of the World; so these also see no Power above themselves; having (in their Imagination) all Power, both in Church and common Wealth: And in imitation to the Prophets, and A∣postles, as being the Church of GOD, using the words of the holy Prophets and Apostles, in Prayer, and singing Praises.</P>
<P>But to who, even to him that gave this Power, and is thus Worshipped? Mind the Apostles words; yea now all the Dominion, Glory, and Might, and wonderful Works of GOD made known to Mankind in the Scriptures, is ascribed to another. Where<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s GOD saith, Isa. 42.8. <HI>I am the LORD, that is my Name, and my Glory will I not give to another; neither my Praise to graven Images.</HI> That now seems to be fulfilled what is Written, 2 Thes. 2.4. <HI>Who
<PB N="77" REF="007622_0075_102BABF4762C8BA8"/>
opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called GOD, or is Worshipped; so that he as GOD, sitteth in the Temple of GOD, shewing himself that he is GOD:</HI> Compared with ver. 9. <HI>Even him whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all Power, and Signs, and lying Wonders,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>So that the great Dragon, that old Serpent, called the Devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole World, <HI>Rev.</HI> Chap. 12.9. Now under <HI>Antichristi∣anism,</HI> hath obtained a far more Glorious Kingdom than in the time of <HI>Heathen∣ism,</HI> and worshipping those dead and dumb Idols, though made of Silver and Gold, and never so curiously Wrought; for saith the Apostle, <HI>Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called GOD, or that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s Wor∣shipped; so that he as GOD, sitteth in the Temple of GOD, shewing himself that he is GOD:</HI> And by his Ministers, can use the words of the Scriptures, and pray, and preach, and sing holy Men's Psalms with great Earnestness, and shew of much Holiness, and God∣liness, together with his other Instituti∣ons

of Worship, compar'd with Rev. Chap. 13.13. <HI>And he doth great Won∣ders, so that he maketh fire come down from Heaven on the Earth in the sight of Men,</HI> ver. 14. <HI>And deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth, by the means of those Miracles which he had Power to do in the sight of the Beast, saying to them that dwell on the Earth, that they should make an Image to the Beast which had the wound by a Sword, and did Live;</HI> That is, the first Beast, or Rulers of the common Wealth: Thus we see by the greatness of his Wonders the Apostle speaks as though he made fire come down from Heaven on the Earth in the sight of Men; and saith, <HI>He deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth, by the means of those Miracles that he had Power to do in the sight of the Beast;</HI> That is, the first Beast, or worldly Rulers; and these are called lying Wonders; 2 Thes. 2.9. <HI>Even him whose coming is after the working of Satan, with all Power, and Signs, and lying Wonders.</HI></P>
<P>And this Image mentioned by the Apostle, we understand to be an Image of Godliness, or a Form of Godliness.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="007622_0077_102BABF679E81CA8"/>
And your Confessions of Faith, as your established Ministers, or Elders, and Messengers have recommended them to the Civil Government in each Colony; and they have established them, and defend them by the force of the Sword: This evidently proves them to be the said Image, made to the Beast, divided to each Government: For the Apostle is not speaking particularly to this, or that, or the other King∣dom, but to the whole World, where CHRIST is Preached: And yet uses the word <HI>Image,</HI> not <HI>Images;</HI> for tho' there may be a Thousand Kingdoms, common Wealths, or Governments under <HI>Antichristianism</HI> in the World, and each of them may have a differing form of Worship, or image of Worship, yet they all make but one Image to the Beast.</P>
<P>As the Body hath many Members, and yet make but one Body. And though the Dragon be called Dragon, Serpent, Devil, and Satan, in Rev. Chapter 12.9. Yet he is but one Spirit.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="007622_0078_102BAC212D2D5690"/>
Thus it is proved that your Con∣fessions of Faith, (as you call them) are not agreable to the Scriptures; but contrary to Scripture, and against plain Scripture; and are therefore not Confessions of Faith in CHRIST, but Faithless Confessions of Antichrist; as by your own Confessions, as aforesaid.</P>
<P>Chap. 22. 1. Paragraph, you say, <HI>The acceptable way of Worshipping the true GOD is Instituted by Himself; and so Limited by His own revealed Will; that He may not be Worshipped accor∣ding to the Imaginations, and Devices of Men, or the Suggestions of Satan, under any visible Representations, or any other way not prescribed in the holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>And you Elders, and Messengers, (as you are called) as you stand to maintain, and defend the said Confessi∣ons, are not Elders and Messengers of the Churches of CHRIST, but of An∣tichrist.</P>
<P>And you Rulers of the Common Wealth of each Government, as you
<PB N="81" REF="007622_0079_102BABF9B4F845B0"/>
exercise your selves as such in the affair of Conscience, and things Relating to the Worship of GOD, you do it not under CHRIST, but against CHRIST, under the Power of Antichrist; as by the Scrip∣tures hath, been fully proved.</P>
<P>In the Form of Church Government in <HI>Boston</HI> Confession, Chap. 17. Paragraph 6. They say, <HI>It is the duty of the Magi∣strate to take care of Matters of Religion, and Improve his civil Authority for Ob∣serving the Duties commanded in the First, as well as for Observing the Duties com∣manded in the Second Table.</HI> And fur∣ther say, The End of the Magistrates Office is not only the Quiet and Peaceable Life of the Subject in Matters of Righteousness and Honesty, but also in Matters of God∣liness, yea of all Godliness.</P>
<P>To this I Answer: The Figurative Kingly Office of CHRIST was Prophesied to Descend of <HI>Judah;</HI> Gen. 49.10. <HI>The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a law giver from between his feet until Shiloh come, and unto him shall the ga∣thering of the People be.</HI> Which was Fulfilled in <HI>David,</HI> and the Kings of <HI>Ju∣dah</HI> 
<PB N="82" REF="007622_0080_102BAC24363A6688"/>
of his Generation, who Represented the Kingly Office of CHRIST in His Church, and had Authority from GOD to Rule both in Church, and Common Wealth. But as <HI>Jacob</HI> saith, <HI>Until Shiloh come, and unto Him shall the gathering of the People be.</HI></P>
<P>We are to understand, that upon CHRIST's coming, the figurative King∣ly Office of the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> was at an End; as is Witnessed by <HI>Moses,</HI> Deut. 18.15. <HI>The LORD thy GOD shall raise up unto thee a Prophet from the midst of thee, of thy Brethren like unto me, unto him ye shall Hearken:</HI> And this was confirmed by GOD Himself, Matth. 17.5. <HI>This is my beloved Son in whom I am well Pleased, hear ye him;</HI> as also Acts 3.22, <HI>For Moses truly said unto the Fathers,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>a Prophet shall the LORD your GOD raise up unto you of your Brethren like unto me, him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it appears by the above quoted Scriptures, tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the figurative Kingly Office of <HI>Judah</HI> is Fulfilled and Ended.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="007622_0081_102BABFB37DDD588"/>
As to the Kings of <HI>Israel,</HI> I shall briefly mention <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> and <HI>Jehu,</HI> who in Particular were Ordained of GOD by His Prophets to rule over the common Wealth of <HI>Israel;</HI> but had no Authority at all over His Church in those things that concern'd the Wor∣ship of GOD; and <HI>Jeroboam</HI> in taking upon himself to set up a form of Worship, it was highly provoking to GOD: See 1 Kings 13.34. <HI>And this thing became Sin unto the house of Jeroboam, even to cut it off, and to destroy it from off the face of the Earth;</HI> and the de∣struction of <HI>Israel</HI> also, Chap. 14.16. <HI>And he shall give Israel up, because of the Sins of Jeroboam, who did Sin, and who made Israel to Sin.</HI></P>
<P>And in that they say, The end of the Magistrates Office is not only the quiet and peaceable Life of the Subject in matters of Righteousness and Honesty; but also <HI>in matters of Godliness; yea of all Godliness:</HI></P>
<P>And to prove it, Name <HI>Moses, Jo∣shua, David, Solomon, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Jehosaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah,</HI> and they might as
<PB N="84" REF="007622_0082_102BAC263A4465A8"/>
well have Named said <HI>Jeroboam, Jehu, Ahab,</HI> and all the Kings of <HI>Israel;</HI> yea and Gentiles also.</P>
<P>And if there were this Day any of the seed of <HI>Judah,</HI> and also sincere Christians, and chosen unto the Office of a Magistrate, they all stand upon a Level, having no Authority at all to judge in any Case tending to Godliness; but in that they commit to the Judg∣ment of the Magistrate <HI>all matters of Godliness;</HI> they take that Authority that GOD has given to CHRIST, and give it to the Magistrate, and in so doing make the Magistrate head of the Church, and not CHRIST. But saith CHRIST, John 5.22.23. <HI>The Father Judgeth no Man, but hath committed all Judg∣ment unto the Son, that all Men should honour the Son even as they honour the father,</HI> &amp;c. And saith the Apostle, Eph. 1.22. <HI>And hath put all things under his Feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>From what has been now Proved from the Old Testament (save the two
<PB N="85" REF="007622_0083_102BACB34F0ACCB0"/>
last Proofs) the civil Magistrate is wholly Excluded from Judging in any case of Conscience, under any Denomi∣nation whatsoever.</P>
<P>And as to the New-Testament, the Gospel was Preached and Received in opposition to the civil Magistrate, as is abundantly Recorded: And all the Encouragement CHRIST has given to His Followers, is by way of Blessing under Persecution,-Matth. 5.10, 11, 12. <HI>Blessed are they which are Persecut<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> for Righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven; Blessed are ye when Men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsly for my sake, rejoice, and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Heaven, for so persecuted they the prophets which were before you</HI> 2 Tim. 3.12. <HI>Yea and all that will live godly in CHRIST JESUS shall suffer Persecution.</HI></P>
<P>I have quoted these Texts out of many, to prove that as the <HI>Jews</HI> that profest themselves to be <HI>Moses Disciples,</HI> persecuted the Prophets; so likewise now
<PB N="86" REF="007622_0084_102BAC27C26572F8"/>
under the Gospel Ministration, they that profess themselves to be CHRIST's Disciples, persecute those that live godly in CHRIST JESUS. And for any People professing the christian Faith, to set up a form of Godliness, and establish it by their humane Laws, and defend it by the Authority of the Magistrate, is to exclude CHRIST from having any Authority over His Church, and themselves to be the supreme head thereof.</P>
<P>Now <HI>Boston,</HI> and <HI>Connecticut,</HI> let us briefly enquire into the doings of our Fore-fathers towards those that separated themselves from them for Conscience sake, and testified against their form of Godliness as also the Anabaptists, and Quakers that came among them.</P>
<P>To begin with <HI>Connecticut,</HI> they punished by setting in the Stocks, by Fining, Whipping, Imprisoning, and chaining in Prison, and causing to set on the Gallows with a halter about the Neck, and prohibiting the keeping quaker Books, and that such Books should be Supressed; as also putting
<PB N="87" REF="007622_0085_102B86EA94BE3228"/>
Father's and Mother's both in Prison from their Children, and then enclosing the Prison with a boarded Fence about ten Foot high with Spikes above, points upwards, and a Gate kept under Lock and Key to prevent any communion of Friends or Relations with the Prisoner's, or communicating any thing necessary for their Support, but must first go near half a Mile to the Prison-keeper to have the Gate opened.</P>
<P>At <HI>New-Haven,</HI> a stranger named <HI>Humphrey Norton,</HI> being put a shore, not of his own seeking, was put in Prison and chained to a Post, and kept Night and Day, for the space of twenty Days, with great weights of Iron, with∣out Fire or Candle, in the winter Sea∣son, and not any suffered to come to visit him; and after this brought before their Court, and there was their Priest <HI>John Davenport</HI> to whom said <HI>Norton</HI> proposed some <HI>Queries,</HI> to which said <HI>Davenport</HI> made <HI>Answer,</HI> and said <HI>Nor∣ton</HI> endeavoured to make a Reply, but was prevented by having a Key tied A-thwart his Mouth till the Priest had done; then said <HI>Norton</HI> was had
<PB N="88" REF="007622_0086_102BAC2A70643EA0"/>
again to Prison, and there detained ten Days, and then sentenced to be severely Whipp't, and to be burnt in the Hand with the Letter <HI>H,</HI> for <HI>Heresy,</HI> who (my Author says) was Convicted of none; and to be sent out of the Colony, and not to return upon pain of the utmost Penalty they could inflict by Law: And the Drum was Beat, and the People Gathered, and he was fetch'd, and strip't to the Waste, and whip't 36 cruel Stripes, and burnt in the Hand very Deep with a red hot Iron, as aforesaid, and then had to Prison again and tendred his Liberty upon paying his Fine and Fees See <HI>George Bishop, New-England Judged</HI> pag. 203. 4. These and the like Things were done in <HI>Connecticut.</HI></P>
<P>Now let us hear what was done in <HI>Boston</HI> Government, as it is to be seen in the title Page of said <HI>Bishop's His∣tory,</HI> touching the sufferings of the People called Quakers, <HI>a brief Relation</HI> saith he, <HI>of the sufferings of the People called</HI> Quakers <HI>in those parts of</HI> America, <HI>from the beginning of the fifth month</HI> 1656, <HI>the time of their first Arrival at</HI>
<PB N="89" REF="007622_0087_102B86EC48EDF320"/>
Boston <HI>from</HI> England, <HI>to the latter end of the tenth Month</HI> 1660, <HI>wherein the cruel Whippings, and Scourgings, Bonds, and Imprisonments, Beatings, and Chain∣ings, Starvings, and Huntings, Fines, and confistication of Estates, burning in the Hand, and cutting off Ears, orders of sale for Bond-Men, and Bond Women, Banishment upon pain of Death, and putting to Death of those People, are shortly Touched, with a relation of the Manner, and some of the most material Proceedings, and a Judgment there upon.</HI> They also burnt their Books by the common Executioner. See <HI>Daniel Neals</HI>'s <HI>History of New-England, Volum.</HI> 1 <HI>Pag.</HI> 292.</P>
<P>They also impoverished them by compelling them to take the Oath of Fidelity, which they scrupled for Con∣science sake, and for their refusing of which, they were fined <HI>Five Pounds</HI> each, or depart the Colony; but they not departing, and under the same scru∣ple came under the Penalty of another <HI>Five Pounds;</HI> and so from time to time, and many other Fines were im∣posed on them, as for meeting by them∣selves. See said <HI>History, page</HI> 320. But
<PB N="90" REF="007622_0088_102BAC2C6B483340"/>
to justify their scruple, see Matth. 5.34, 35, 36, 37. <HI>But I say unto you, Swear not at all, neither by Heaven for it is GOD's Throne, nor by the Earth for it is His Foot stool, neither by Jerusalem for it is the City of the Great KING, neither shalt thou Swear by thy Head because thou canst not make one hair White or Black; but let your communication be yea, yea, nay, nay, for whatsoever is more than these com∣eth of Evil.</HI> Jam. 5.12. <HI>But above all things my Brethren Swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth, neither by any other Oath; but let your yea, be yea, and your nay, nay, lest you fall into Condemnation.</HI></P>
<P>Whether these express Commands from CHRIST, and His Apostle, that thus forbids us all kind of Swearing whatso∣ever, be not sufficient witness for a Disciple of CHRIST to scruple an Oath, I leave to the Reader; these and many more such like Things the An∣abaptists, and Quakers suffered at the hands of their Persecutors in <HI>Boston Government,</HI> as may be seen at large in said <HI>Bishops,</HI> and <HI>Neals History's.</HI>
<PB N="91" REF="007622_0089_102B86EF8CCEE288"/>
Now let us take a view of the suf∣ferings of the Martyrs in <HI>England,</HI> in Queen <HI>Marie</HI> Reign, as it is to be seen in a Book, the Title, <HI>the Spirit of the Martyrs Revived,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>They were put in Prison, and then in Irons divers ways to afflict them; and in Prison put in Stocks, and their books Burnt, and themselves Beaten, and Whip't, and many other ways des∣pitefully used; and after all burnt to Death.</P>
<P>And in said Book is contained a briefs Relation of the barbarous Cruelties, Per∣secutions, and Massacres upon the Pro∣testants in foreign Parts, by the Papists, some Drowned, some buried Alive, some burn't to Death, and many other Torments beyond the humanity of Man to Devise, much less to Inflict.</P>
<P>Thus Briefly I have given the Rea∣der a Relation of the Persecutions by the Papists; and their Authority is from themselves, by Laws of their own ma∣king, to defend institutions of Worship set up by themselves: The <HI>Pope</HI> by their Church Order, being entitled the
<PB N="92" REF="007622_0090_102BAC2DEE0E38E0"/>
<HI>most Holy Lord Pope, CHRIST's Vice-Gerent on Earth, the Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>the Holy Mother Church of</HI> Rome, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And now I return to <HI>Boston,</HI> and <HI>Connecticut</HI> with reference to what was said touching the doings of bur Fore∣fathers; they not being repented of, nor called in Question, but a persisting in acts of force upon Conscience in some measure, to this Day and their Authority is also from themselves, to defend their own form of Worship; as appears by <HI>Boston Confession,</HI> as was cited.</P>
<P>In that they say, <HI>The end of the Magistrates Office, is not only the quiet and peaceable Life of the Subject, in matters of Righteousness, and Honesty; but also in matters of Godliness, yea of all Godliness.</HI></P>
<P>Thus they assume to themselves the Whole Government of Godliness, and so so rule over the revealed Will of GOD, in His Children: But CHRIST saith, Matth. 10.27. <HI>What I tell
<PB N="93" REF="007622_0091_102B86F1167AF588"/>
you in Darkness, that speak ye in Light, and what ye hear in the Ear, that preach ye upon the House tops; and fear not them which, kill the Body,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>So that this is not to oppose Man, but GOD; by the aforesaid acts of Cruelty, to maintain and defend their own form of Worship, by rising up against GOD's Message by the Mouth of His Messengers, to turn them from their evil Ways, by warning them of GOD's Judgments; as saith CHRIST John 7.7. <HI>The World cannot hate you, but me it hateth, because I testify of it, that the works, thereof are Evil.</HI></P>
<P>Thus much of <HI>Boston.</HI></P>
<P>And now a Few words touching <HI>Con∣necticut.</HI></P>
<P>They also assume to themselves their Authority to rule over the Church of GOD, and the Light of Conscience; as we may see in an Election SERMON, Preached before the General ASSEM∣BLY, of the Colony, of <HI>CONNEC∣TICUT,</HI> in <HI>Hartford, May 12th</HI> 1748, By <HI>Nathaniel Eells.</HI></P>

<P>Thus said <HI>Eells</HI> has declared them to be CHRIST's Vice-gerents on Earth, and they have confirmed it by putting it in Print; and in as much as there has been no Confession nor Repentance of the aforesaid Persecutions of our Fore-fathers, neither by them, nor since: But a willful going on against the
<PB N="95" REF="007622_0093_102B86F2FAC07378"/>
light of Conscience, and the express Command of CHRIST, to do to others as we are willing to Receive: And saith He, <HI>This is the Law, and the Prophets,</HI> Matth. 7.12.</P>
<P>Thus much <HI>Connecticut.</HI></P>
<P>Thus I have presented the Reader with a view of the Persecutions by our Fore-fathers in <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and <HI>Boston</HI> Governments; as also of the Persecu∣tions in <HI>England</HI> in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> by the Papists; and also in said foreign Parts by the Papists; and have shewed that their Authority pro∣ceeded from themselves: The Pope, by the Papists, being allowed to be CHRIST's Vice-gerent on Earth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> the holy Mother Church of <HI>Rome, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now if these Titles are truly, and rightly apply'd to the Pope, and Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> then why may they not de∣vise, and make Laws, and join Punish∣ments to the breach of each Law accor∣ding to their Discretion in the defence, and for the preservation of their supposed

holy Institutions of Worship, and accor∣dingly proceed to do all the aforesaid acts of Violence upon their fellow Creatures?</P>
<P>And why may not <HI>Boston</HI> Govern∣ment, if it be true indeed, in that they say, <HI>The end of the Magistrates Office is not only the quiet and peaceable Life of the Subject, in Matters of Righteous∣ness, and Honesty; but also in matters of Godliness; yea of all Godliness.</HI></P>
<P>I say then, why may not they de∣vise, and make Laws according to their Discretion, in the defence, and for the preservation of their supposed holy In∣stitutions of Worship; and accordingly proceed to do all the acts of Violence upon their fellow Creatures, as afore∣said?</P>
<P>And why may not <HI>Connecticut Govern∣ment</HI> also, if it be true, and from the Spirit of Truth, that they are CHRIST's Vice-gerents on Earth, <HI>Commissioned and Sent,</HI> as they say, to <HI>defend his Cause, and do his Work.</HI> I say, if all this be true, have they not a good Warrant to devise, and make Laws according
<PB N="97" REF="007622_0095_102BABFD81073AB8"/>
to their own Discretion, and appoint such Punishments as they think proper for the breach of each Law, for the Support of their supposed holy Institu∣tions of Worship; and accordingly pro∣ceed to do all the aforesaid acts of Violence, upon their fellow Creatures?</P>
<P>Thus for <HI>Connecticut,</HI> and <HI>Boston Go∣vernment</HI>'s ASSEMBLY Protestants.</P>
<P><HI>England,</HI> in the Reign of Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> and said foreign Parts, being Papists, these being Named as aforesaid; and each of them assume to themselves hu∣mane Authority, to rule over the Church of CHRIST, and Light of Conscience.</P>
<P>And if we allow it to one, we must allow it to all, one as much as another; and not only to these, but to all Papists, and Protestants, throughout the World, even to all People that profess the Gospel.</P>
<P>For as CHRIST hath not limited Kingly Power to any particular People, now under the Gospel Ministration, as GOD did to the Tribe of <HI>Judah</HI> under the Law; so that throughout the World
<PB N="98" REF="007622_0096_102BAC345C5259D8"/>
where CHRIST is Named, whether Papists, or Protestants; they have equal Right to set up Kingly Authority to rule over the Church of GOD, as any of those already Named, <HI>Viz.</HI> The Papists in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, and those in foreign Parts; and <HI>Boston</HI> Go∣vernment, and <HI>Connecticut.</HI></P>
<P>And as I have thus given the Rea∣der a brief View of the Works of each, I think these sufficient to Judge them by their Works.</P>
<P>For as much as the Scripture saith, <HI>In the Mouth of two, or three Wit∣nesses, the Matter shall be Established.</HI></P>
<P>But if we will Read the History's Cited, we may see Hundreds more of unrighteous, and inhumane Actions done to the Sufferers: And many of them by the Officers.</P>
<P>To my knowlege was taken from a Man, only for the cost of a Justices Court, and Court charge of Whipping him, for Breach of SABBATH, (so called) a Mare worth a <HI>hundred Pounds,</HI> and nothing returned; And
<PB N="99" REF="007622_0097_102BABFF624DE7F8"/>
this is known by us yet Living, to have been the general Practice in <HI>Con∣necticut.</HI></P>
<P>And now I desire every Christian Reader, to give his Judgment particu∣larly of these above Named, whether their proceedings against the Sufferers were not all of one Spirit? as for Instance, one partly put to Death by Burning, another by Drowning, another by Hanging: Were not all these acts of Violence upon their fellow Creatures? I call for Judgment. CHRIST saith, <HI>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, neither can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit.</HI> And saith He, <HI>By their Fruits ye shall know them.</HI> And the Apostle saith, Rev. 13.15. <HI>He</HI> (that is the Dragon) <HI>had power to give life unto the image of the Beast, that the image of the Beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not Worship the image of the Beast should be Killed.</HI></P>
<P>And here we see the Apostles Pro∣phecy fulfilled: And in differing ways in <HI>Connecticut Confession,</HI> Chap. 24. they
<PB N="100" REF="007622_0098_102BAC35DF1BF188"/>
Quote to <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. and Tit. 3.1. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> 2.13, 14, 17. to prove the civil Magistrates Authority to rule in the Church. And in <HI>Boston</HI> form of Church Government, Chap. 17. they also Quote to <HI>Rom.</HI> 13. 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> 2.1, 2: in like Manner, to prove the Magis∣trates Authority in the Church.</P>
<P>Thus they borrow the heathen Ma∣gistrates Authority, that required the Worshipping of Idols to rule, and govern the Church under a conformity to their several Institutions of Worship; and so use the carnal Sword to defend their own Institutions, as the Heathen did their's.</P>
<P>And thus the Dragon's Head that was wounded to Death, by the light of the Gospel in the time of the pri∣mitive Church, now comes to be hea∣led, by the falling away of the Church in Antichristianism: But it is the same Dragon and same persecuting Spirit that required the Worshipping of Idols, and persecuted the primitive Church, that now professes himself to be a Christian, and furnishes himself with

College learn't Ministers, nourish't up in Pride through Idleness, and volup∣tious Living: And these are his Mi∣nisters; and they are the same set of Men, that CHRIST thank't GOD that He had hid the mysteries of the King∣dom of GOD from, <HI>Matth.</HI> 11.25.</P>
<P>And he allures the Rulers of the common Wealth, that GOD hath set to do Justice among Men, to take under their Care <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e Government of the Church also; which is very pleasing to the Flesh, for the sake of more honour, and glory of the World, to∣gether with the enmity between the two Seeds, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3.15.</P>
<P>So that he may rightly be said to be the GOD of this World, 2. Cor. 4.4. <HI>In whom the God of this World hath blinded the minds of them which believe not,</HI> &amp;c. And to <HI>sit in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God,</HI> 2 Thes. 2.4. And saith the Apostle, <HI>which deceiveth the whole World,</HI> Rev. 12.9, And in Chap. 13. ver. 14, 15, <HI>Saying to them that dwell on the Earth, that they should make an image to the Beast,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And
<PB N="102" REF="007622_0100_102BAC37DF2DC020"/>
cause that as many as would not Wor∣ship the image of the Beast should be Killed.</HI></P>
<P>Thus he appears to be the God of this World, having gotten all the out∣ward Glory of Religion, and the Powers of the World, on his side, to defend all his Institutions of Wor∣ship, or Image made to the Beast.</P>
<P>And thus as we see by the Scrip∣tures, the Antichristian Church Anoti∣mized, and laid Naked before our Eyes.</P>
<P>Let us take the warning given us, Chap. 14.9, 10. <HI>And the third Angel followed them, saying with a loud Voice, if any Man Worship the Beast, and his Image, and receive his Mark in his Fore-head, or in his Hand, the same shall drink of the Wine, of the Wrath of GOD, which is poured out without Mixture, into the Cup of his Indignation; and he shall be Tor∣mented with Fire, and Brimstone, in the presence of the holy Angels, and in the presence of the Lamb.</HI></P>

In the foregoing Treatise, the Rea∣der may see how I have formerly been with the Elders and Messengers, and General Courts of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> with this Scruple, that sundry Articles in their Confession of Faith had not Scrip∣ture Proof, but they regarded it not, and in the Year 1754, I went to the General Court at <HI>Hartford,</HI> and also to the General Court at <HI>Boston;</HI> considering their Confessions were both one; and that both Governments lie under the same Reproof that they would peruse them, and consider them, but neither of them regarded, so as to enquire into them.</P>
<P>And I have published three Treatises already, touching these Things; but there has been no Answer made to any; and this is the Fourth; that after so much Proof, I think it may truly be said of them, as in Rev. 2.2. <HI>And thou hast tried them which say they are Apostles, and are not, and hast found them Lyars.</HI></P>
<P>Lyars Indeed, both to GOD, and Man, to give forth such a Body of Articles of Faith for our rule of Life,
<PB N="104" REF="007622_0102_102BAC39EDB80E48"/>
that are so contrary to Scripture, and against the plain commands of CHRIST as words can express; and yet recom∣mend them to us, and to our Posterity, as the unchangeable, and eternal Truths of GOD, founded upon the holy Scrip∣tures.</P>
<P>See <HI>Connecticut Preface,</HI> Page 8. And much more to this Purpose, I have quoted out of said <HI>Preface,</HI> as the Rea∣der may see; and they say, that <HI>GOD alone is LORD of the Conscience:</HI> And <HI>hath lest it free from the Doctrines, and Commandments of Men,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>And then set up their own Doctrines, and Commandments to be observed, and leave it to carnal Men to devise what Punishments shall be Inflicted upon the Transgressors, in defence of said Doc∣trines, and Impower the Civil Magis∣trate to execute them against the revea∣led Will of GOD in the Heart, which is the light of Conscience, and so give GOD the Title of Lord-ship, but make themselves Lord of the Conscience, by subjecting it under their humane Laws, and carnal Weapons, by the Power,
<PB N="105" REF="007622_0103_102BAC04ECD2B758"/>
and Authority received from the Dra∣gon, as in Rev. 13.2. <HI>And the Dra∣gon gave him his Power, and his Seat, and great Authority.</HI></P>
<P>And from this Spirit of Persecution received from the Dragon, proceeds all Persecution, that arises where CHRIST is Received; even so as to make divi∣sions between nearest Relations, in Fa∣milies, <HI>Matth.</HI> 10.34. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and it is also hurtful to Kingdoms and common Wealths, to molest People that live Honestly, and are diligent in their law∣ful Employments, and live under confor∣mity to all Things, relating to the good and benefit of the common Wealth, ex∣cepting those Things that they Scruple for Conscience sake towards GOD; as in the case of <HI>Daniel, Dan.</HI> 6.5.</P>
<P>I say, to molest such, by injuring either their Persons, or Estates, is so far violating the peace, and good of the common Wealth, which the civil Magistrates Work is to Preserve.</P>
<P>In a word, to go to rule the Church by the power of the Magistrate, is to
<PB N="106" REF="007622_0104_102BAC3D603FD048"/>
destroy the peace of both Church, Fa∣milies, and common Wealths. But on the contrary, CHRIST is said to be <HI>the Prince of Peace,</HI> Isa. 9.6. And when he was Born into the World, this Testimony was given of him from Heaven, Luke 2.13, 14. <HI>And suddenly there was with the Angel, a Multitude of the Heavenly Host, praising GOD, and saying, glory to GOD in the Highest, and on Earth peace, good will towards Men.</HI> As also, Rom. 10.15. <HI>As it is Written, how Beautiful are the Feet of them that preach the Gospel of Peace, and bring glad Tidings of good Things.</HI></P>
<P>And all that walk in his Spirit, fol∣low his Example, to <HI>live peaceably to∣ward all Men,</HI> as also toward the com∣mon Wealth, and to pay Tribute, as he did, for Peace sake, rather than to offend, <HI>Matth.</HI> 17.24. <HI>&amp;c.</HI> But not as a due Debt; for saith the Apostle, Tim. 1.9. <HI>The Law is not made for a Righteous Man,</HI> but saith he, <HI>for the Lawless, and Disobedient, for the Ungodly, and for Sinners,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="007622_0105_102BAC07F092EBD8"/>
Thus it appears by this Text, that the Law is not made for the Righteous, and they are therefore not Indebted to the Law, so as to pay Tribute, or the like, as a due Debt, but as a free, and voluntary Act, for Peace sake, ra∣ther than to Offend.</P>
<P>There is no Compulsion in CHRIST's Church, neither towards GOD, nor Man; but every Man, to whom it is given, is at his own free Will, to Chuse, or Refuse for himself; as 2 Cor. 5.20. <HI>We are Ambassadors for CHRIST,</HI> saith the Apostle, <HI>as thô GOD did beseech you by us, we pray you in CHRIST's Stead, be ye reconciled to GOD.</HI> Rev. 22.17. <HI>The Spirit and the Bride say Come, and let him that heareth say Come, and let him that is a thirst Come, and whosoever will, let him take of the wa∣ter of Life freely.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we see, tho' all Power was given to CHRIST, as He saith, <HI>Both in Heaven, and Earth,</HI> Matth. 28.18. Yet the Foundation of his Church is Love; as he saith, John 3.16. <HI>God so loved the World, that he gave his
<PB N="108" REF="007622_0106_102BAC3EE3A85F48"/>
only begotten Son, that whosoever believ∣eth on him should not Perish, but have eternal Life.</HI></P>
<P>And CHRIST has given it as an evidence to the World, to know his Disciples, by their Love, one to another; John 13.35. <HI>By this shall all Men know that ye are my Disciples, if ye love one another.</HI></P>
<P>And our said Confessions tell us, Chap. 22 1. Parag. <HI>The acceptable way of Worshipping the true GOD is Insti∣tuted by himself, and so limited by his own revealed Will, that he may not be Worshipped according to the imaginations, and devices of Men, or the suggestions of Satan, under any visible Representati∣ons, or any other way not prescribed in the holy Scriptures.</HI></P>
<P>And in the 7th, and 8th Parag. speaking particularly of their first Day SABBATH, (so called) and in it's Sanctification, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> in effect say, <HI>We must Worship GOD according to the imaginations and devices of Men, and suggestions of Satan,</HI> by subjecting it un∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er the watch and power of Authority;
<PB N="109" REF="007622_0107_102BAC09EBF17748"/>
and this agrees with the Apostles Tes∣timony, Rev. 13 4. <HI>And they worship∣ped the Dragon which gave power to the Beast, and they worshipped the Beast,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>But as to said Sabbath, there is no command, nor example, nor name in Scripture for it; as hath been proved, and will stand proved, till it is dis∣proved.</P>
<P>Thus they deceive the World, in a shew of extolling GOD, and the Scrip∣tures; but it is nothing but a flourish of Words, out of the smoke of the bot∣tomless Pit of Antichrist, to gain the stron∣ger Authority for their Antichristian Sab∣bath; the observing of which, is the great Idol of <HI>New-England,</HI> which the Worldly Powers defend by Stocks, Whips, Pri∣sons, and taking away the Estates of the King's peaceable Subjects, that sup∣port the common Wealth.</P>
<P>Concerning Signs, GOD made him∣self known to <HI>Pharaoh</HI> by Signs, and Miracles, pronounced and wrought by <HI>Moses,</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> till by great Judg∣ments he was forced to let <HI>Isreal go:</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="007622_0108_102BAC41187D5150"/>
So likewise when CHRIST was mani∣fested in the Flesh, GOD manifested himself in him <HI>by Signs, and Miracles,</HI> in doing <HI>merciful Deeds,</HI> in <HI>healing the Sick,</HI> and <HI>curing all manner of Diseases</HI> and <HI>opening the Eyes of the Blind,</HI> and <HI>raising the Dead,</HI> and <HI>casting out Devils,</HI> and the like: But notwithstanding all these Signs and Miracle, the <HI>Jews</HI> pre∣sumptuously desired of him a Sign from Heaven; he said unto them, <HI>O ye H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣pocrites, ye can discern the face of the Sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the Times?</HI> Matth. 16, 1. &amp;c. As if these Signs were not from Heaven: As Indeed they said, <HI>This Fellow doth not cast out Devil's, but by Belzebub the Prince of the Devil's:</HI> And they coun∣ted him a Deceiver, and charged him with Blasphemy.</P>
<P>Thus it appears that they had no Judgment to Judge of Signs, whether they were of GOD, or of the Devil: They had let in such a wilful Spirit of Unbelief, and hardness of Heart, and Persecution, that the Devil had gotten that Power over them, as to make them believe Lies, and oppose the
<PB N="111" REF="007622_0109_102BAC0BEB46E738"/>
Truth: In a word, they trusted in their own Righteousness, and rejected the Righteousness of GOD in CHRIST, and so procured this doleful Sentence against themselves, Math. 23 37, 38. <HI>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, thou that killest the Prophets, and stonest them which are sent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thy Children together, even as a Hen gathereth her Chickens under her Wings, and ye would not; behold your House is lest unto you desolate.</HI></P>
<P>The destruction of their Fathers, was their not hearkening to the warnings of the Prophets; but Persecuted them, and put them to Death: And the Destruc∣tion of these, was, their wilful rejecting the Gospel Preached by CHRIST, and his Apostles, and confirmed to be the Gospel of GOD, by the Sign, and Mi∣racles that they Wrought: They both former, and latter, were destroyed by a mighty Destruction, and we can think no better of their eternal Estate without Repentance; these are all gone <HI>to come to Judgment, to receive according to the deeds done in the Body,</HI> and ought to be our Examples, to take Warning lest we fall into the like Condemnation.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="007622_0110_102BAC43B745A880"/>
Now as touching our Fore-fathers who came out of <HI>England,</HI> because they were not allowed to Worship GOD ac∣cording to the light of their own Con∣sciences, but were Persecuted, and there∣fore came into this Country, that they might not be debarred that Liberty; but how soon did they set up a form of Worship contrary to Scripture, of humane Invention, and then subjected the observing it under the Power of Au∣thority; and so became destroyers of that Liberty that their Fathers had pur∣chased at so dear a Rate, and Persecu∣ted those that for Conscience sake with∣drew from their established Worship.</P>
<P>I now sum up this Discourse, in pro∣ving that all the established Worship of <HI>New-England</HI> defended by the worldly Powers, is nothing but the Worship of the Dragon, and the Beast, and his Image: For saith the Apostle, Rev. 12.9. <HI>The great Dragon was cast out, that old Serpent, called the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole World,</HI> of which <HI>New-England</HI> is a part; and their Worship, or Image, made to the Beast, (<HI>Chap. 13. ver. 14.</HI>) is made up
<PB N="113" REF="007622_0111_102BAC0DA7DA8B90"/>
of Contradictions, of Scriptures; and therefore of necessity comes under the Apostles Testimony, that <HI>they are decei∣ved with the rest of the World.</HI></P>
<P>And that it is defended by the worldly Powers, by the Power and Authority given them by the Dragon; see Ver. 2. <HI>And the Dragon gave him his Power, and his Seat, and great Authority.</HI></P>
<P>That is to say, the power and seat of Persecution; and that it is the Wor∣ship of the Dragon, and the Beast in fellowship together, see ver. 4. <HI>And they Worshipped the Dragon which gave Power unto the Beast, and they Wor∣shipped the Beast,</HI> &amp;c. And that the Power, Seat, and Authority given to the Beast by the Dragon; is intended the Seat of Persecution: Let us com∣pare it with ver. 15. <HI>And he had power to give life unto the Image of the Beast, that the Image of the Beast should both speak, and cause that as many as would not worship the Image of the Beast, should be Killed.</HI></P>
<P>By the Scriptures thus it is Proved, that all the established Worship of <HI>New-England,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="007622_0112_102BAC46AC56D480"/>
defended by the worldly Pow∣ers, is nothing, but the Worship of the Dragon, and the Beast, and his Image; and also proved that the Power, Seat, and Authority given to the Beast, or worldly Powers, by the Dragon; is the power, and seat of Persecution to defend the said Worship, given to the Image of the Beast.</P>
<P>And the Sin of false Worship, was the Crying Sin that provoked GOD to send his Judgments upon <HI>Israel</HI> in the time of the Law, from time to time, to their utter Destruction; as is abun∣dantly Recorded in Scripture.</P>
<P>And if we will take the Scriptures for our Instructors, as the Apostle saith, <HI>All Scripture is given by Inspiration of GOD, and is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.16. Then let us hear how it Saith, that GOD visits <HI>the Iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children, and upon the Children's Chil∣dren, unto the third, and to the fourth Generation,</HI> Exod: 34.7.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="007622_0113_102BAC1029AC6178"/>
And this GOD doth, in his Patience, and Forbearance by lesser Judgments, to warn a People to turn from their evil Ways in time; and not only by his Judgments, but also by his Messen∣gers that he sends; Jer. 25.4. <HI>And the LORD hath sent unto you all his Servants the Prophets, rising early and sending them, but ye have not Hearkened, nor enclined your Ear to Hear.</HI></P>
<P>And these Warnings, both by his Judgments, and by his Messenger, GOD hath been warning <HI>New-England,</HI> by visiting the Iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children, and upon the Chil∣drens Children, down to this Day; as by the <HI>Indian</HI> Wars, that began soon after the Persecuting, and putting the <HI>Quaker's</HI> to Death, from which <HI>New-England</HI> has had no assurance of Peace to this Day.</P>
<P>And GOD has visited <HI>Boston,</HI> with the Small-Pox, five Times, since they, put the said Quakers to Death; and also other Sickness that has been very Mortal in <HI>New-England;</HI> and the Can∣ker, that has been very Mortal among
<PB N="116" REF="007622_0114_102BAC48A74D6AA8"/>
Children; and GOD has cut us short of the Fruits of the Earth, by Blasting almost all sorts of Grain, and by Droughts, and untimely Frosts, and Worms, and such like Things.</P>
<P>But there has been no returning to GOD, notwithstanding all these Judg∣ments, and Warnings; but a wilful maintaining, and defending the Wor∣ship of the Dragon, the Beast, and his Image.</P>
<P>And whereas it is reflected upon the Quakers, that a Woman went into a Meeting Naked, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I find in <HI>George Bishop's History of the Quakers Sufferings,</HI> That two Wo∣men went Naked, and both as Signs, one into a Meeting, the other went Naked through the Streets of <HI>Salem,</HI> 'till she was laid hold on, and so also was the other, and both had to Court, one at <HI>Ipswich,</HI> the other at <HI>Salem,</HI> and both Whip't as an abominable Thing.</P>
<P>Now for our Instruction in the Thing, let us Consider; Reason will not allow that they did it in any Spirit of Lewd∣ness,
<PB N="117" REF="007622_0115_102BAC1229A61C00"/>
or Whoredom, for the places would not admit of any such Actions; no not so much as in the Countenance: But rather that they did it in Submissi∣on to a divine Power, as <HI>Abraham</HI> was Commanded of GOD, to offer his Son <HI>Isaac</HI> for a Burnt-offering, <HI>Gen.</HI> 22.1, 2. As a Figure, <HI>Heb.</HI> 11.17. So also these as a Sign, to warn them of the Judgments of GOD that was com∣ing upon them for their blindness, and hardness of Heart, and cruel Persecutions; instead of hearkening to GOD's Message, by the Mouth of his Messengers.</P>
<P>And this bears a Resemblance of the <HI>Indians</HI> Custom, who are said to make their Captives run the Gantlope Naked, through whole Companies of <HI>Indians;</HI> surely it is time for this reproachful re∣flection to Cease, and to take the shame of it to our selves; and so let it pass as a Sign, as in Ezek. 12.11. <HI>Say I am your Sign, like as I have done, so shall it be done unto them,</HI> &amp;c. As also Chap. 24. 24. <HI>Thus Ezekiel is unto you a Sign, according to all that he hath done shall ye do; and when this cometh, ye shall know that I am the Lord God.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="007622_0116_102BAC4AA5C06208"/>
Now as to <HI>Boston,</HI> to prove the Ma∣gistrates Office over all Godliness, they Name <HI>Moses, Joshua, David,</HI> &amp;c. with∣out confining it within the Church, as Church Members, nor within the com∣pass of <HI>New-England;</HI> this gives equal Authority to all Magistrates, whether Papists, or Protestants, throughout the whole World, to exercise their Authori∣ty in, or over all Godliness; and so to be a terror to the Church, or faith∣less Professors in it: As the Sons of <HI>Anak,</HI> were a terror to faithless <HI>Israel, Numb.</HI> 13 33. And the Apostle speaks after the same Manner of the Wor∣shippers of the Dragon, and the Beast, Rev. 13.4. For saith he, <HI>They Wor∣shipped the Dragon which gave Power unto the Beast, and they Worshipped the Beast, saying, who is like unto the Beast, who is able to make War with him?</HI></P>
<P>And whether these do not bare a proper Resemblance of each other, let every Reader judge, <HI>viz.</HI> The Sons of <HI>Anak,</HI> and the Worldly Powers.</P>
<P>I find in <HI>Daniel Neal's History of New-England,</HI> Vol. I. Pag. 310, &amp;c.
<PB N="119" REF="007622_0117_102BAC14A31DC6D0"/>
That the Persecuting, and putting the Quakers to Death in <HI>New-England,</HI> was of such ill Report in the several Nati∣ons in <HI>Europe,</HI> which obliged the Ma∣gistrates to publish to the World the following Declaration, in their own Vin∣dication; which said Declaration is next following in said History; but I shall Reherse but little of it; for they in publishing it to the World to justify themselves, plead to the Laws of GOD, and to the Judgment of all prudent, and pious Men; but if they had had the Laws of GOD, for putting to Death those that differed from them in matters of Religion, they should have brought them, to convict those they past the Sentence of Death upon for Conscience sake, which would have been the only Thing, not only for their Conviction, but also for their own Vindication, both before GOD, and all prudent, and pious Men.</P>
<P>And towards the close of said De∣claration, say, our own just, and necessa∣ry Defence, calling upon us, other means failing, to offer the point which these Persons have violently Rushed up∣on;
<PB N="120" REF="007622_0118_102BAC4D22326118"/>
and thereby become <HI>Felones de se,</HI> that is to say, self Murderers; yet in <HI>Boston</HI> Preface to their Confession, pag. 1. 2. <HI>We find how ready,</HI> say they, <HI>the Apostle was, to make a Confession of his Faith, tho' for that hope sake, he was accused, and put in Chains.</HI></P>
<P>And further say they, <HI>The Martyrs of JESUS, who have laid down their Lives in bearing W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tness to the Truth, against the Infidelity, Idolatry, Heresy, and Apostacy of the World, when</HI> Pagan Arian, <HI>or over-spread with Popish Dark∣ness, having their Feet shod with the preparation of the Gospel of Peace, were free, and forward in their Testimony, Con∣fessing the Truth, yea Sealing it with their Blood.</HI></P>
<P>And further say, <HI>Nor is there a grea∣ter Evidence of being in a State of Sal∣vation, than such a Confession, if made in times, or places, where Men are expo∣sed to utmost Sufferings upon that Ac∣count.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we see as the <HI>Jews,</HI> who said, <HI>If we had been in the Days of our
<PB N="121" REF="007622_0119_102BAC162418C0D0"/>
Fathers we would not have been parta∣kers with them in the Blood of the Pro∣phets;</HI> yet were the only Men to have CHRIST put to Death: So likewise these commend former Martyrs for their freeness, and forwardness in Sealing their Testimony with their Blood; yet these Persecuted, and put to Death those that testified against their evil Works in the like free, and forward Spirit, with their Lives given up, (as was said) to Seal their Testimony with their Blood, the former they Justify, calling them the Martyrs of JESUS; the latter they Condemned, and put to Death, and say, they were Self-Murderers; and yet ac∣knowlege such a bold Confession as the greatest evidence of Salvation.</P>
<P>Having proved by the Scriptures, as aforesaid, that all the established Wor∣ship of <HI>New-England</HI> defended by the worldly Powers, is nothing but the Worship of the Dragon, and of the Beast, and his Image; as also proved that the Power, Seat, and Authority given to the Beast, or worldly Powers, by the Dragon is the Power and Seat of Persecution, to defend the said Wor∣ship,
<PB N="122" REF="007622_0120_102BAC4F1ED4C2E0"/>
given to the Image of the Beast; and this Image recommended to the Beast by our Fore-fathers, was by them Established, Worshipped, and De∣fended by Persecution; and by them recommended to succeeding Generati∣ons, which we may now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay in Scrip∣ture Phrase, <HI>That GOD has been visiting the Iniquities of the Fathers upon the Children, and upon the Childrens Chil∣dren, unto the thirds and fourth Genera∣tion.</HI></P>
<P>And GOD has been warning us by his Messengers, but it has not been Re∣garded; but they have been inhuman∣ly Persecuted, and some put to Death, as hath been Declared, and their Blood cries aloud for Vengeance, as in Rev. 6.9 10. <HI>And when he had opened the fifth Seal, I saw under the Altar, the Souls of them that were Slain for the word of GOD, and for the Testimony which they held; and they cried with a loud Voice, saying, how long, O LORD, Holy and True, dost thou not judge, and avenge our Blood on them that dwell an the Earth.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="007622_0121_102BAC17B32D3DF8"/>
O <HI>New England, New-England,</HI> It is high time to awake out of Sleep, since it is so loudly Sounded in your Ears, that all your high pretences of Worship∣ping GOD, is nothing but the delusions of the Devil, and worshipping the Dra∣gon, the Beast, and his Image; high time indeed to enquire into these Things, and to intreat GOD to let you know Him, and to know your Selves; and so to set about the work of Repentance, and Con∣fessing your Iniquities, and the Iniquities of your Fathers in all their, and your Persecutions, and acts of force upon Conscience, and in particular their put∣ting the Servants of GOD to Death, and then to vindicate it to the World, say, <HI>they were Self Murderers,</HI> adding Sin to Sin: But saith CHRIST, Matth. 5.23.24. <HI>If thou bring thy gift to the Altar, and there remembrest that thy Brother hath ought against thee, leave there thy gift before the Altar, and go thy way, first be reconciled to thy Brother, and then come, and offer thy gift. So also David,</HI> Psal. 26.6. <HI>I will wash my Hands, saith he, in Innocency, so will I compass thine Altar, O LORD.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="007622_0122_102BAC50A19C6E60"/>
Consider these Texts, and don't go to the Altar of GOD to offer the Sacrifices of Prayer, with your Hands defiled with the Blood of his Saints, thinking to be heard whilst the Blood of his Saints, and Martyrs under the Altar, are crying aloud for Vengeance against you.</P>
<P>And not only to confess this Sin but to confess and repent of all o∣ther Sins, but especially the Sin of false, Worship which you have so long made a Righteousness of, which is to withdraw from all your established Mi∣nisters that Preach for Hire, and from the practical part of your Confessions, and the civil Government to quit them∣selves of judging in Church Affairs, or cases of Conscience; and all those that have put their Sons to Colleges in order for Ministers of the Gospel, to take them Home; For as in Lev. 20.2. &amp;c. <HI>He that gave of his Seed unto Molech was to be put to Death.</HI></P>
<P>Now this was offering them to the Devil for burnt Offerings. See <HI>Jer.</HI> 19.5.
<PB N="125" REF="007622_0123_102BAC1B59D58680"/>
And Men putting their Sons to Col∣leges to be fitted for Minis;ters of the Gospel, but is in Truth for Ministers of Antichrist, or Satan, who is said to deceive the whole World, and done in as great Blindness as the Former.</P>
<P>For CHRIST thank't GOD that he had hid the Mysteries of GOD from such, Matth. 11.25 Chap. 15. 14. <HI>They be Blind leaders of the Blind,</HI> saith CHRIST, <HI>and if the Blind lead the Blind, both shall fall into the Ditch.</HI></P>
<P>Also Repeal all Laws touching Reli∣gion, and Conscience.</P>
<P>These are the Things that call to be done speedily, lest GOD come upon us by his final Judgments, and there be no Redemption: As he came upon the old World after an <HI>hundred and twenty Years</HI> Preaching by <HI>Noah,</HI> and upon the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who notwithstanding all the Signs, and Wonders wrought in <HI>Egypt,</HI> went presumptuously after <HI>Israel</HI> into the red Sea, and so were made to know the LORD, <HI>Exod.</HI> 14.25. So <HI>Israel,</HI> notwithstanding the warnings of
<PB N="126" REF="007622_0124_102BAC5226447688"/>
all the Prophets, went on presumptuously to their own Destruction, and so were made to know the LORD; as it is abundantly Repeated in <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> of GOD's Executing his Judgments upon <HI>Israel</HI> for their manifold Sins: And then saith he, <HI>They shall know the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>And now, <HI>New-England</HI> has gone an above an <HI>hundred Years</HI> in worship∣ping <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Dragon, the Beast, and his Ima<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd GOD has testified against them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> by his Servants, and his Judgements, but they have Persecuted his Servants, and gone on in their Sins; and in effect, say unto GOD, <HI>Depart from us, for we desire not the knowlege of thy ways,</HI> Job 21. 14.</P>
<P>That without speedy Repentance, we may have cause to fear GOD's speedy judgments, even such as to teach us § <HI>See</HI> Daniel Neal's <HI>History of</HI> New-En∣gland, <HI>Vol. I. pag. 278, &amp;c. in two Records, bearing Date 1651, touching the Persecuting the Anabaptists, in de∣fence of the then established Worship.</HI>

to know him, and to acknowlege his Servants, and his warnings from their Mouths, and to acknowlege his Judg∣ments to be Just, tho' to our own Destruction; and GOD may rightly answer us in those Words, Prov. 1 24. &amp;c. <HI>Because I have Called; and ye Re∣fufed; I have stretehed out my Hand, and no Man Regarded; but ye have set at nought all my Counsel, and would none of my Re∣proof; I also will Laugh at your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, I will Mock when your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> your Fear cometh as Deso<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="6 letters" DISP="••••••"/> and your Destruction as a Whirlwind, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI></P>
<P>In a Word, GOD will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> known by us, either in Mercy, or in Judgment. Thus I leave it to each Government to do the works of Repentance, according to their Sins.</P>

<P>WHO has been writ<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> and Practising against the civil Governments, and Churches of <HI>Boston,</HI> &amp; <HI>Connecticut,</HI> for more than 30 Years past; and no Body has taken so much Notice of it, as so give him an Answer, according to his own Declaration and Complaint made at <HI>Hartford, May</HI> last, before the Governor of <HI>Connecticut,</HI> President of <HI>New Heaven</HI> College, &amp; sundry other Gen∣tlemen there Convened, on the anniversary Election. Moreover, the Gentlemen I have Advised with since, are generally of the Opi∣nion, 'tis best, to take no public Notice him. I should therefore have past the matter over in silence, had I not encouraged him at <HI>Hart∣ford,</HI> to expect an Answer from me, at a con∣venient Season. And besides, some Gentle∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an of worth, have thought the doing of

it, may be of real service to the cause of Truth, and Religion.</P>
<P>I shall therefore upon the whole (in brief) say, That I think, Friend <HI>Bolles</HI> has offer'd nothing new (in Substance) but what we have had over, &amp; over, by Writers of his turn of Mind: But however, that I may become all Things, to all Men; I will take some transient Notice of, and give some compen∣dious Answers to what he has Wrote; (thô in my Judgment, as well as many others, whom I esteem of maturer thought, the pains, &amp; trouble of Writing, &amp; cost of Printing, might better been spared on both sides) and I say,</P>

<P>IN the Relation, Friend <HI>Bolles,</HI> has given of his Experience (thô the care of divine Providence is to be seen, &amp; acknowleged; and the Goodness of GOD, which leadeth to Repentance; yet) the fruits of Repentance, are not so visible (in Friend <HI>Bolles</HI>) as could be desir'd, <HI>viz.</HI> Humility, Meekness, Gentleness, Kindness, Goodness, Forbearance, Peace, Be∣nevolence, Charity, Honor to whom Honor is Due, &amp;c. And if what Friend <HI>Bolles</HI> has Writ∣ten, be the sum of his Experience, I can't (to Speak plainly, &amp; faithfully) but fear he is yet short of Regeneration, &amp; the sanctification of the Spirit, Unto a life of Holiness. Thô at the same Time, I would put on charity, and hope.

he is not a stranger to true christian Experi∣ence, althô he has not held it forth (at least) to me, in the account be has given in Writ∣ing. But in case he be a real Christian (and the Foundation stands sure, having this Seal, the LORD knows who are His.) The sum of my Wish, Desire, and Prayer for him, &amp; all other Friend Quakers, is, that his, and their Light may so shine before Men, that others may see his, and their good Works, (and I among the rest) and so Glorify their, &amp; our Father which is in Heaven: But if the case be otherwise with him, or them, of any of them; would to GOD, they may have Re∣pentance given them, to the acknowleging of the Truth, and unto life Eternal.</P>

O Monstrous Quaker∣ism!—But what are those 4 Articles, our (shall I call him Omnipotent, or more than Omnipotent Antagonist, says, The disprov∣ing of which will over-throw all Things; and even the Author of all Things Him∣self! why!</P>
<P>The Sabbath, as set forth in the Confes∣sion, Chap. 22 Parag. 7. He says, GOD in∣stituted the seventh Day as a Rest for Him∣self, not for Man; contrary to the express Words of our Saviour, Mar. 2.27. <HI>The Sab∣bath was made (egenito)</HI> had its Birth <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">or was Begotten.</NOTE> for Man. But when did it take its Birth? was it not from the Creation? Did not the LORD bless, and sanctify the seventh Day, from the beginning? see, and compare, Gen. 2.3. <HI>And God blessed the seventh day, and sancti∣fied

it;</HI> with Exod. 20.11. <HI>Wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath Day, and hallowed it.</HI></P>
<P>Friend <HI>Bolles</HI> says, The 7th Day which GOD ordained as a Sabbath, or Day of Rest, was not a natural Day (for that no morning or evening is ascribed to it) but an eternal Day of Rest. But what sense would this make of other Scriptures? should we Explain them so. <HI>Jonah</HI> was sent to <HI>Nineveh,</HI> with this Message; <HI>Yet forty Days, and Nineveh, shall be overthrown.</HI> But no morning, and evening, were ascribed to the Days, were they therefore forty eternal Days?—But there was no Sabbath from the Fall of Man, to the falling of Manna, <HI>Exod.</HI> 16, 23. says my An∣tagonist. And why? because no mention is made of it. No mention is made of any Daughters being born, 'till a little before the Flood, (for more than a thousand Years) and therefore was there none? No mention is made that the Giants (<HI>Gen.</HI> 6, 4:) descend∣ed from <HI>Adam,</HI> or any of his Posterity: Were they therefore a new Generation of Men, no way related to <HI>Adam,</HI> &amp; his Posterity? Many of the Commands were not so much as men∣tioned 'till <HI>Moses</HI>'s Day; did they not there∣fore 'till then, belong to the Decalogue, or moral Law? But is it not evident enough, that the Law of the Sabbath was publish'd, &amp; obligatory, long before <HI>Moses</HI>'s Time, e∣ven
<PB N="10" REF="007622_0136_102BAC5F1596F658"/>
from the beginning? For that part of the original Institution, is brought down into the second Publication of it in <HI>Moses</HI>'s Day; and that even word, for word. And 'tis plain beyond all reasonable Dispute (as publish'd by <HI>Moses,</HI> at the falling of Manna, and as it stands in the moral Law) it is not consider∣ed as a new Command; but as old as the Creation. Tho'it had been much abused, &amp; profaned, by an abandon'd wicked World; and even much, and long violated by GOD'S own professing People: Therefore we find <HI>Moses</HI> speaking of it, as what was already published, and known, Exod. 16.23. <HI>This</HI> (says he) is <HI>what the Lord hath said,</HI> (not what He doth now Command,) <HI>To-morrow is,</HI> (not to morrow shall be) <HI>the rest of the Sabbath:</HI> Therefore we find the Complaint made in the 23th ver. of the same Chapter; <HI>How long?</HI> mark the Words! how long? Had they been strangers to the Command 'till then, they coud'nt had a long Time to have broke it; as the Question imply's; <HI>Re∣member the Sabbath-Day;</HI> imply's it had mi∣serably been neglected, violated, &amp; even for∣got!</P>
<P>Friend <HI>Bolles</HI> says, The Sabbath was only for the <HI>Jews,</HI> and continued 'till CHRIST, &amp; so come to an End; and since that all Days are alike. But will any one believe this?
<PB N="11" REF="007622_0137_102BAC9566983408"/>
who considers, That the Command to keep the Sabbath, is one of the Ten Commands of the Decalogue; and is of a moral, as well as positive Nature; and as to its moral Nature, is universally, and perpetually Binding. To spend a part of our Time to worship, &amp; serve GOD publickly, is of universal, and perpetual Obligation; and this must respect <HI>Adam,</HI> &amp; his Posterity, yea, all his Posterity, one as well as another. Again, the reasons, and ends of its Institution, are in general the same, and so common, and obligatory on Mankind. As GOD'S finishing His works of Creation; His blessing, &amp; sanctifying the Sabbath-Day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And even where the Sabbath is called a Sign, and the keeping of it Holy, a keeping Cove∣nant with GOD; or GOD's perpetual, and e∣verlasting Covenant with His People, <HI>Exod.</HI> 31. I say, even there, 'twas not only obli∣gatory on the <HI>Jews;</HI> but <HI>Gentiles</HI> too. The Stranger, <HI>i.e</HI> the <HI>Gentile</HI> Stranger, within the <HI>Jewish</HI> Gates, was bound to keep the Sabbath, as well as the <HI>Jew;</HI> and as much needed the Sabbath as a Sign that GOD was an Holy GOD; and that they should be an Holy People. They needed as much to be brought into Cove∣nant Relation, as the <HI>Jews</HI> did; and the Court of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI> was opened for that End, to invite, and bring them in, and bind them to their Duty; and especially to the keeping
<PB N="12" REF="007622_0138_102BAC618C0CC338"/>
holy the Sabbath, which they had long, &amp; no∣toriously neglected &amp; profaned, which was a sign, &amp; evidence they were Unholy, &amp; Abomi∣nable in the Sight of GOD; while <HI>Jews,</HI> &amp; pro∣selyted <HI>Gentiles,</HI> who were faithful in sanctify∣ing the Sabbath, carried with them, one very considerable Sign, and visible Evidence that they were an Holy People, &amp; Consecrated to an Holy GOD; and not desecrated to pro∣fane, and abominable Idol-gods.</P>
<P>Indeed, we find the fourth Command en∣forced, from the consideration, that they were Servants in the Land of <HI>Egypt;</HI> and that the LORD brough them out from thence, with a high Hand, <HI>&amp;c. Deut.</HI> 5 15. The Reasons of which Enforcement, seem plain enough to be these two, more especially.</P>
<P N="1">(1) Because they had with, and in the ser∣vice of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> profaned the Holy Sab∣bath; therefore they were now more especi∣ally to take care, to sanctify that Day, they had so often, Profaned.</P>
<P N="2">(2) They being now by divine Grace, &amp; a series of Miracles, brought out of the Land of Servitude, and brought into visible Cove∣nant with GOD, to be his People; this, to∣gether with the other nine Commands of the Decalogue, was reinforced, and this more e∣specially, shewing their Liberty from Servi∣tude, and great Privilege of keeping a Day

of Rest, or Sabbath to the LORD. But then we must remember agreable to our Assembly of Divines the Reasons annexed to the fourth Command (as binding on <HI>Gentiles,</HI> as well as <HI>Jews</HI>) are, <HI>God's allowing us six Days of the Week for our own employment, His chal∣lenging, a special</HI> right, and <HI>propriety to the seventh, His own example, and His blessing,</HI> &amp; sanctifying <HI>the Sabbath day.</HI></P>
<P>Friend <HI>Bolles</HI> says, The first Day of the Week, is not the Christian Sabbath; nor any Day, as distinguish't, one from another; but all Days in common, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>I answer, There is a Christian sabbath-Day, as distinguish't from the Days of the Week in common: And that this Day is the first-Day of the Week; which may be evidenc'd divers Ways.</P>
<P N="1">[1] Agreable to the fourth Command, which is of a moral, as well as positive Na∣ture; and according to the morality of the fourth Command, a certain part, and pro∣portion of our Time, is due to divine, and public Worship, <HI>viz.</HI> in ordinary, &amp; common he seventh part of Time; and which ac∣cordingly was originally enjoyn'd by a po∣sitive Command, to be the se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enth Day; and which was again renewed, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>forced, in <HI>Moses</HI>'s Day. Thus it appears according to the morality of the fourth Command (which
<PB N="14" REF="007622_0140_102BAC63485FFB60"/>
if otherwise the fourth Command must be thrown out of the Decalogue) That all Days are not like a Sabbath; but that a seventh part of Time is a Sabbath; and that accordingly, the seventh Day was set apart by a positive Command; and so continued till the Gospel commenced.</P>
<P N="2">[2] That the first Day of the Week, is the Christian Sabbath: I argue from the appel∣lation, or name of First-Day-Sabbath, that is sundry Times given to it, in the New Testa∣ment; <HI>Mat.</HI> 28.1. It is there said, accord∣ing to the Original Greek, <HI>In the End Sab∣batoon, of the Sabbaths,</HI> viz. the Jewish Sab∣baths, or Seventh-day Sabbaths, as it began to dawn towards <HI>Mian Sabbatoon,</HI> the first-day Sabbaths, <HI>i. e.</HI> the Christian Sabbaths. I call (<HI>Mian</HI>) the First-Day, because 'tis the same word used by the Septuagint, for the First-Day of the Creation. See <HI>Gen.</HI> 1.5. <HI>Hemera Miâ</HI> the First-Day.</P>
<P>So we read also, Mark 16.1, 2. <HI>And when the Sabbath, i. e.</HI> the Jewish Sabbath <HI>was p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st, Diagenomenoü</HI> (it might he rendred, was done with, or abolisht) <HI>came Mary, &amp;c.</HI> ver 2. <HI>And very early in the Morning, The Mias Sabbatoon:</HI> The First of the Sabbath <HI>viz.</HI> of the Christian Sabbaths, or First-Day Sabbaths, (as before) they came, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="007622_0141_102BAC9A6133F060"/>
So also, Luke 24, 1. <HI>Now upon Te Miá toon Sabbatoon:</HI> The first of the Sabbaths, <HI>viz.</HI> of the First-Day-Sabbaths, or Christian Sab∣baths, or Gospel Sabbath, very early, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>Now from these Scriptures (which I have honestly, and fairly Cited, and Explained) it appears that the seventh Day-Sabbath, is come to an end, &amp; abolished: And never∣theless, that there is a weekly Sabbath; and so the morality of the fourth Command re∣mains; for that every first Day, is the Christ∣ian Sabbath: This I might argue, &amp; shew at large, was there need of it.</P>
<P>But I proceed,</P>
<P N="3">[3] To say, The first Day of the Week is the Christian Sabbath, as may appear from the example of the Apostles, and Christian Disciples keeping that Day as a Sabbath, Acts 20.7. <HI>And upon the first Day of the Week, Te mia toon Sabbatoon,</HI> i e. the first Day Sabbath, or Christian Sabbath, <HI>when,</HI> viz. <HI>when</HI> the Disciples <HI>statedly</HI> came together to break Bread, <HI>Paul</HI> Preached to them. So we read 1 Cor. 16.1, 2. <HI>Now concerning the collection for the Saints, as I have given Or∣der to the Churches of Galatia, so do ye; up∣on the first Day of the Week; Kata Mian Sabbatoon;</HI> from first-Day-Sabbath, to first-day-Sabbath, let every one of you lay by him, <HI>The saurisown ô.</HI> Now why was this Order
<PB N="16" REF="007622_0142_102BAC65AC95ECD8"/>
given to the Churches, if it was not of a pub∣lic Nature? and why on the first Day of the Week, or first Day Sabbath? If it was'nt the Christian Sabbath: And why must they deposit their Collections in the Treasury on that Day? or to be put into the Treasury, or public Stock, on that Day <HI>viz.</HI> the first-Day-Sabbath; if they did'nt publickly meet on that Day; and why should they publickly meet on that Day? <HI>Kata mian Sabbatoon;</HI> ac∣cording to the first-Day-Sabbath, if it was not the Christian Sabbath.</P>
<P N="4">[4] That the first Day of the Week is the Christian Sabbath, I argue from Analogy, Heb. 4, 10. <HI>For He,</HI> viz JESUS, <HI>That has entered into His Rest, viz</HI> first-Day-Rest, hath ceased, or rested from <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Katapausa</NOTE> his own Work, <HI>viz.</HI> of Redemption, like as <NOTE N="‖" PLACE="marg">Oosper</NOTE> (in a party ana∣logy, or just like as) GOD did from His Works of Creation. And how did GOD Rest from His Works? Why, by ordaining a Sabbath; not merely for Himself (as Friend <HI>Bolles</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>inks) but for Man, Exod. 20.8, 9, 10, 11 At the end of the Command, is sub∣joined <HI>Wherefore the Lord blessed the sabbath Day, &amp; hallowed it,</HI> The <HI>Wherefore,</HI> shews the Sabbath was originally ordained for Man; and that this was the Day, that follow∣ed

the six foregoing Days, &amp; so had a Morn∣ing; and that it was a Day, <HI>viz.</HI> the seventh Day, and so had an Evening, contrary to what Friend <HI>Bolles</HI> suggests. Now as GOD finish't His Works of Creation, &amp; rested the seventh Day, as a Sabbath ordained for Man: So CHRIST has finish't His Works of Re∣demption, when He Rose from the Dead, on the first-Day, and ordained that Day for the Christian-Sabbath.</P>
<P N="5">[5] I Argue the first-Day of the Week, to be the Christian-Sabbath, not only from the Disciples meeting on that Day: But CHRIST'S meeting &amp; blessing them on that Day; He first made His Appearance to His Disciples on that Day; Joh. 20, 19. <HI>Then the same Day at evening, being the first-Day of the Week, Te mid Toon Sabbatoon,</HI> being the first Christian-Sabbath, <HI>when the Doors were shut, where the Disciples were Assembled—came Jesus, and stood in the midst, saying, Peace,</HI> &amp;c.—So again the next Lord's-Day, or Christian first-Day-Sabbath, He met them, ver. 26. <HI>And after eight Day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> again,</HI> that is, with that Day, which brought them to the first-Day-Sabbath again, or as it may be ren∣dered, <HI>Meth' hemeras Octw,</HI> within eight Days exclusive <HI>i.e.</HI> the seventh Day, from that Day which was the first Day, <HI>Jesus came again when they were assembled together.</HI> So the

holy Spirit was sent down on that glorious, and memorable Day of Pentecost, <HI>Acts</HI> 2.1. Which was the first-Day of the Week, or Christian-Sabbath, when the Disciples (ac∣cording to the Christian Institution) were Assembled together.</P>
<P N="6">[6] I might argue the point at large, both from the Old Testament, &amp; New compar'd: But I forbare.</P>
<P N="7">[7] I might argue From Tradition, &amp; bring no inconsiderable light, &amp; evidence in clear∣ing the Truth before us. <HI>Ignatius</HI> contem∣porary with the Apostles, to besure with St. <HI>John,</HI> the beloved Disciple, says, as having re∣ceived it from them, <HI>"Let every one that loves Christ, keep the Lord's-Day, as consecrated to His Resurrection;</HI> this is the prime, or be∣ginning of Days in the Christian Aera, in which Death is conquered, and Life is sprung up" St. <HI>Austin,</HI> after him, and agreably to other the renowned Fathers contemporary with, &amp; after Apostles, says, <HI>The Apostles ordain'd the Lord's-Day, to be kept with a religious Ho∣liness, because in the same our Redeemer arose from the Dead; and therefore 'tis called the</HI> LORD'S-DAY, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> This was the first-Day of the World, and the HOLY GHOST was gi∣ven on this Day, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Now says the Apostle <HI>Paul,</HI> 2 Thes. 3, 6. <HI>We command you Bre∣thren, in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ,

that ye withdraw your selves from every bro∣ther that walketh disorderly, &amp; not after he Tradition which ye received of us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Finally,</HI> I could argue the Point more at large from Reason, Revelation, and Tradi∣tion. But why should I light a Candle, to give Light to the Day! Or a Lamp, to add brightness to the Sun!—I shall therefore proceed to Friend <HI>Bolles</HI>'s,</P>
<P N="2">2 <HI>Objection, viz.</HI> That an Oath is not Lawful under the Gospel, as set forth in the Confession, Ch. 22 Para 2 And wherefore? why, Be∣cause our LORD hath said, Matt. 5.34, and on ward, <HI>Swear not at all; neither by Heaven, for it is God's Throne; nor by the Earth, for it is His Foot-stool,</HI> &amp;c. And His Apostle <HI>James</HI> to the same purpose, <HI>Ch.</HI> 5. <HI>v.</HI> 10. Now I would ask, Wherein these two places, of Scripture Cited, or any other in the New-Testament, are we forbidden Swearing by the Living, &amp; True GOD? Was not an Oath sacred, under the Old Testament, as well as New? Was it Lawful in the Old-Testament Day, to Swear by Heaven, Earth, or Jerusa∣lem, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Did not the Law injoyn Men to Swear by the Name of the LORD GOD? and consequently forbid them to Swear at all, by any other Oath. Certain I am, if there be any moral evil in taking an Oath, it was e∣qually so under the Old, as under the New-Testament:
<PB N="20" REF="007622_0146_102BAC6AE0799170"/>
Therefore if there be any evil in taking an Oath, it must be, because now po∣sitively Forbidden. But thô it be positively, and peremptorily Forbidden, to Swear by any Thing, that is not GOD; because a mo∣ral Evil so to do; as might be shewn at large: Yet it is not forbidden by any means, to Swear by the True GOD: Yea tis a moral Vertue when the Case requites it; as might be shewn at large: And so the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> understood it; who doubtless well understood the Sense of CHRIST'S, and His Apostle <HI>James</HI>'s Prohibition: And therefore we find him saying, Heb. 6.16. <HI>For Men verily Swear by the Greater, viz.</HI> by the Great GOD, <HI>and an Oath for confirmation, is to them an end of all Strife.</HI> Now observe all is uttered in the present Time; not the past; the A∣postle doth not say, Men used to Swear in the Old-Testament Day; and that an Oath was then taken for Confirmation; but <HI>is, viz.</HI> now under the Gospel Dispensation. A∣greably we find the Apostle Calling GOD for a Record, or to bear Witness, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> being the sub∣stance of an Oath, 2 Epist. to the <HI>Cor.</HI> 1.23. So we find him using the same Word in the <HI>Greek</HI> that is used for Swearing, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 15.31. So we find him solemnly enjoyning the <HI>Thes∣salonians</HI> by an Oath, <HI>ORKIZO humas ton Kurion,</HI> i. e. <HI>I Swear you,</HI> or <HI>lay you under an
<PB N="21" REF="007622_0147_102BAC9FE2C65BE8"/>
Oath to the Lord, &amp;c.</HI> Hence I think it plain even to a Demonstration, that the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> did'nt understand all kinds of Swearing forbidden; no, by no means, but only, a com∣mon, rash, &amp; profane Swearing; a Swearing by Heaven, Earth, Jerusalem, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> To Swear by Creatures, is to deify them, which ever was, and ever will be unlawful. To Swear in our common Conversation; which should be, yea, yea, nay, nay, is to profane an Oath; which should be always esteemed religious, solemn, and sacred: But to take an Oath for confirmations, to end Strife, and to shew our Loyalty, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is of a Nature moral, religious, and praise-worthy, and unchangeable good, whether under the Old Testament, or New But I pass on to Friend <HI>Bolles</HI>'s,</P>
<P N="3">3 <HI>Objection,</HI> Which is against Baptizing, by pouring, sprinkling: As also against Baptiz∣ing Infants of believing Parents; as set forth in the Confession, Ch. 29. Para. 3, 4. Holding that none but adult Believers, are to be Bap∣tized; and that by plunging, or dipping all∣over in the Water.</P>
<P>I <HI>Answer,</HI> That thô I hold dipping, or plung∣ing in Water, is acceptable Baptism, if other∣wise rightly Administred: Yet I must say with the Confession, I don't hold it necessary: But believe Baptism is rightly performed by pouring, washing, or sprinkling of Water,
<PB N="22" REF="007622_0148_102BAC6C9BDBE1B8"/>
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> And that because, that althô <HI>Bapto</HI> (from whence <HI>Baptism</HI>) signifies dipping in Water, and is frequently used so: Yet never do I find <HI>Baptizo,</HI> or <HI>Baptismos</HI>(from whence we have Baptism) I say, I never find the latter to signify the dipping in Water; but Wash∣ing, whether by laving, pouring, or sprink∣ling: And accordingly the word Baptism, is used for the washing of Hands, Cups, Pots, brazen Vessels, and Beds, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which is com∣monly done by the taking up of Water, and pouring on them. But you will say, Why did <HI>John</HI> then Baptize in <HI>Jordan,</HI> and <HI>Enon?</HI> And I may ask, Why did he Preach in the Wilderness? And why did he eat Locusts, &amp; wild Honey? If you say, to fulfill ancient Prophecy, he came a Voice, crying in the Wilderness; may I not add, &amp; say, To com∣pleatly fulfill that Character, he Baptized in the River of <HI>Jordan,</HI> and in the Brooks, or little Streams of <HI>Enon,</HI> near <HI>Salem.</HI> But you Will say, They went down into the Water, &amp; came up out of the Water. Yes, <HI>Philip</HI> went down into the Water with the Eunuch: But was the going down into the Water, or com∣ing up out of it Baptism? no, no, this was done only for the conveniency of Baptizing; for <HI>Philip</HI> by going down into the Water, was not Baptized; but Baptized the <HI>Eunuch,</HI> by pouring, washing, or sprinkling him with
<PB N="23" REF="007622_0149_102BACA1AFD87960"/>
Water, in the Name of the Sacred Trini∣ty. But perhaps you will say, We are Buri∣ed with CHRIST in Baptism unto Death: Allow it. But what was the Baptism, with which CHRIST was Baptized unto Death? Was it not the pricking Thorns, Nails, and Spear? which stain'd all His Raiment, as one that had been treading in the Wine-Press; a resemblance of the sprinkling of the Blood of CHRIST, for the remission of Sin. Altho'I am nothing against dipping, or even plung∣ing all-over in Water when the Season will allow, or Constitution endure it; Yet I must again say with the Confession, I don't see it necessary; but think washing with Water full as Good; a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eable to the Words of <HI>A∣nanias</HI> to <HI>Paul,</HI> Acts 22.16. <HI>Arise, and be Baptized, and wash away thy Sins, Calling on the Name of the Lord Jesus.</HI></P>
<P>But Friend <HI>Bolles</HI> Objects, and say, In∣fants have no Right to Baptism.</P>
<P><HI>I Answer,</HI> If believing <HI>Abraham's</HI> Chil∣dren had no Right to Circumcision, the be∣lieving <HI>Gentiles</HI> Children have no Right to Baptism: but if believing <HI>Abraham's</HI> Chil∣dren had a Right to Circumcision, why not the <HI>Gentile</HI> believers Children to Baptism? since we are assured, the Covenant Blessing of <HI>Abraham,</HI> is come upon, or unto the be∣lieving <HI>Gentiles.</HI> And why not the whole?
<PB N="24" REF="007622_0150_102BAC6EB4F5D4B0"/>
Why a Part only? <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.6,—10. If a Blessing to <HI>Abraham</HI> to have his Children in visible Covenant; why not to us, to have Ours? May'nt we love our Children as well as he did his? and prize such a Favour as much as he? And are not our Children as capable of Baptism, as <HI>Abraham</HI>'s were of Circumcision? and may'nt it be esteem'd as great a privileged of as good use, &amp; ten∣dency to our Children, as to the Children of <HI>Abraham?</HI> But it may be Friend <HI>Bolles</HI> will say, Circumcision appertained to the Law, &amp; was a sign, and seal of a <HI>Jewish</HI> ceremonial, political, and national Covenant; all which are abolisht, under the Gospel, both Cove∣nant, Seal, <HI>&amp;c</HI> And that now there is a new Covenant, new Seals, new Subjects, &amp;c. I answer, Circumcision no more appertain'd to the Law (in its original Institution) than Baptism it self; being more than 400 Years before the Law was given by <HI>Moses;</HI> being also a seal of that Covenant made with <HI>A∣braham,</HI> which Covenant we are assur'd, in the 3d Chap. of <HI>Galations,</HI> was a Covenant of Promise, a Covenant of Grace, or Gospel Covenant. And this ancient Promise, Co∣venant, or Grant made to <HI>Abraham</HI> (to whom the Gospel was Preach'd, as well as unto us: see <HI>Gal</HI> 3.8.) I say the same Convenant, or Pomise stands good to all <HI>Abrahams</HI> Seed,
<PB N="25" REF="007622_0151_102BACA4A972D318"/>
<HI>viz.</HI> Believers, whether <HI>Jews,</HI> or <HI>Gentiles;</HI> and Will do so to the End of the World.</P>
<P>In short, The old <HI>Abrahamitical Cove∣nant</HI> is reviv'd, renew'd, and enforced; formerly with a red Seal, signifying the Im∣putation of CHRIST'S Blood for the Re∣mission of Sin: The latter a white Seal, signifying the Virtue of that Blood, apply'd by the Holy Spirit, to the cleansing away all Sin. Hence it appears, that the Covenant of Grace was the same (in substance) in <HI>Abrahams</HI> Day, as in Ours; and that <HI>Circum∣cision,</HI> and <HI>Baptism,</HI> are respectively. Seals of the <HI>same Covenant;</HI> and belong to the <HI>same Subjects, viz.</HI> Believers, &amp; their Infant Seed. For if the contents of the Covenant be the same, the privileges of the Covenant must remain the same to the federates, or subjects of the Covenant, althô in the reviving, re∣newing, and transcribing the Covenant (on behalf of the Gentile World) a white Seal, should be affixt, instead of a Red.</P>
<P>Wherefore as <HI>Abraham,</HI> when he believ∣ed, or agreed to the terms of the Covenant proposed (by the overture of divine Grace) had a right to the seal of the Covenant, not only for himself (according to the Tenure of it, but also for his Children: So in like manner, has the believing Gentile. And so we read: The <HI>Goaler</HI> upon his believing,

But enough has been said upon the divine Right of Infant Baptism, by many before, and in our Day: And perhaps in saying any thing, I have said too much: I shall there∣fore, no longer hold a Candle to see the Sun: But come to Friend <HI>Bolles,</HI></P>
<P>4th, And last <HI>Objection, viz.</HI> That the civil Ruler, has nothing to do with Religi∣on; as asserted in the Confession, Ch. 24. Para. 3, 4. But where in all the Scripture, do we find the Cognizance, or Notice of the civil Ruler limited, or restrain'd to things Temporal only? are not civil Rulers to <HI>be a terror to evil doers, and praise to them that do well,</HI> Rom. 13.3. Are not civil Rulers to punish <HI>evil doers;</HI> encourage, and re∣ward them that do Well? 1 Ep. <HI>Pet</HI> 2, 14. The Characters of such as are disturbers of the Peace, and disorderly in the State, are such as despise Government; speak evil of Dignities; who walk after the Flesh; Pre∣sumptious, Self-willed, Riotous, Deceivers; such as forsake the right Way; and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>Is the civil Ruler to be a Terror to Evil∣doers? Is he a revenger to execute Wrath upon him that doth Evil? And is not Blas∣phemy, Sodomy, and Beastality doing Evil? And may'nt the civil Ruler take notice of it? Is not Atheism, Antichristianism, Tri∣theism, Sabellianism, Arianism, Pelagianism, and other such like abominable Herifies, I say are they not a forsaking the right Way, even the way of Truth? And may not the civil Ruler take Notice of them, and their abetters? Is a quiet Life, <HI>viz.</HI> a domestick private Life, as well as a peaceable Life, viz. a social public Life, and is a Godly Life, as well as an honest Life, coupled together (as

exquisite &amp; due in Conscience, to the right dis∣charge of Duty under civil Government) who then dare be so bold as to put asunder, what GOD hath join'd together? And if GOD has promised, that the Church (in the Gospel-Day) shall be favour'd with Kings for her nursing Fathers, and Queens for her nursing Mo∣thers; who dare be so brazen Fac'd, &amp; lost to all Modesty, as to say, The civil Ruler has nothing to do with the Church, or Religi∣gion? And has the civil Ruler nothing to do with <HI>Riotous,</HI> and <HI>Infamous</HI> Persons? As <HI>Neal</HI> in his History of <HI>New-England,</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">as m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y be seen at large from P 322 to 328.

I should not have mentioned, these mon∣strous Practices of the Quaker (which Darkness it self is hardly black enough to cover) had I not found Friend <HI>Bolles</HI> justi∣fying of them as Things innocent, &amp; lawful.

<P>But I must withdraw my Hand, having designedly, but touch'd upon those Eviden∣ces, and Elucidations, I might have hand∣led at large, &amp; to greater advantage, and especially on this last Objection, about which Friend <HI>Bolles</HI> has drawn out his Dis∣course to so great a length, fetching his E∣vidence from the Dragon, the Beast, &amp;c. How he has Succeeded, How clear his Proofs, &amp; how just his Application, &amp; how Christian like his Reflections, I leave to the Reader to judge (if any has the patience to Read it) In the mean Time, I commit all to Him that judges Righteously;</P>

<P>It was with great Difficulty that this Law was obtained; the Court of, Ma∣gistrates indeed pass'd it roundly with∣out the Clause of being tried by a <HI>Jury,</HI> agreeing that it should be exe∣cuted by a County Court consisting of three Magistrates, a Majority of whom were to give Judgment; but the Court of Deputies would by no means give their consent, it being contrary to the Laws of <HI>England,</HI> to put Men to Death without T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ial by a Jury, but the Magistrates at last, by prevailing with two of the Deputies to change Sides, carried it in the House of De∣puties by the Majority of a single Voice, the Speaker and eleven being against it, and thirteen for it.

By these Two Records, the Reader may make some Judgment of the Justice, or Unjustice done of both Parties.</P>
<P>In said Answer, pag. 5. saith he, <Q><HI>The Calamities alighting on</HI> New-England, <HI>Friend</HI> Bolles, <HI>after</HI> Bishop, <HI>and others of the Quakers says, They were sent as a Judgment for putting the Quakers to Death: but what Master taught him so?</HI></Q></P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>The Scriptures, and in Particular. 2 Kings 9.7. <HI>And thou shalt smite the House of Ahab thy Master, that I may avenge the Blood of my Servants the Pro∣phets and the Blood of all the Servants of the Lord, at the hand of Jezebel.</HI> Matt. 23.34, 35, 36. <HI>Wheresore, behold I send unto you Prophets, and wise Men. and Scribes, and some of them ye shalt Kill and Crucifie, and some of them ye shall scourge in your Synagogues, and Per∣secute them from City to City:</HI> Note, the Whip∣ping of the Quakers at Carts-tails from Town, to Town, yea, through many Towns.

Son of Barachias, whom ye Slew be∣tween the Temple, and the Altar. Verily, I say unto you, all these things shall come upon this Generation.</HI> This is to be un∣derstood the Generation of Persecutors.</P>
<P>Pag. 6 saith he, <Q><HI>The Blood of the Quakers, says Friend</HI> Bolles, <HI>rests on the head of us the Children of our Ancest∣ors, who put them to Death, expresly Contrary to</HI> Ezek. 18.3, 4. <HI>The Son shall not bear the iniquity of the Father,</HI> &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>It must be considered with Confession of our own Iniquities, and the Iniquities of our Fathers in all the known Sins that they, and we have Sinned, otherwise we ly under the guilt of their Sins, as well as our own. See Exod. 34.7. <HI>Visiting the I∣niquity of the Fathers upon the Children, and upon the Childrens Children, unto the third and fourth Generation.</HI> Lev. 26.40. <HI>If they shall confess their Iniquity, and the Iniquity of their Fathers,</HI> &amp;c. Yea, the Jews if now Converted, have to confess the Sin of their fore Fathers in putting CHRIST to Death: Yea, said <HI>Johnson</HI> is not out of danger, so far as he excu∣seth our Ancestors in putting said Qua∣kers to Death.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="007622_0169_102BACB6B8947F40"/>
Pag. 7. he pleads, <Q>That our Fathers <HI>could not be Drunk with the Blood of the Quaker Martyrs, when they made choice of the Savoy Confession of Faiths,</HI></Q> as in my Book is Queried, Pag. 13. Be∣cause it was more Ancient than the Qua∣kers Sufferings.</P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>I meddle not with that of the <HI>Savoy,</HI> nor that at <HI>Westminster,</HI> but what they themselves agreed upon, and ordered to be Printed in the Year, 1680. See my Book Pag. 20. 21. and the Quakers Suf∣ferings began twenty four Years before. See my Book, Pag. 88. 89.</P>
<P>Pag. 7. 8. he saith, <Q><HI>Friend</HI> Bolles <HI>tells us, there are four Articles of Faith wrong, and very erroneous in the Con∣fession,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>And that in proving the four Articles Erroneous, he shall of Con∣sequence Prove the whole Confession so.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>The Word <HI>whole</HI> was rased out be∣fore it went to the <HI>Press;</HI> but the fol∣lowing Words, Or Image made to the Beast, See <HI>Rev.</HI> 13. <HI>v.</HI> 14. remains to be explained. See my Book, Pag. 6. Line 10, 11.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="007622_0170_102BAC864AF61B48"/>
In Pag. 8. he says, that I say <Q><HI>God Instituted the seventh-Day as a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est for Himself, not for Man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>These are words of his own Framing, and not as I have Spoken. And then he saith, <Q><HI>I have said contrary to the express Words of our Saviour,</HI> Mark 2.27. <HI>The Sabbath was made for Man, &amp;c.</HI></Q> But as I have Written, I do not contradict our Saviour at all: For I allow all that is written in the Bible about the Rest, or Sabbath, to be for Man, and for Man's Teaching; and I have no where said as he has charged me. All which the Rea∣der may observe in reading over what I have Written, beginning at my 30th Pag. He ought to say, the words exact as they are spoken.</P>
<P>He argues much for a Sabbath between <HI>Adam,</HI> and <HI>Moses,</HI> yet he has not shewn one place of Scripture that forbad La∣bour, nor one place of Scripture where any person was blamed for Prophaning the Sabbath in all that time; and not∣withstanding he has found neither Law nor Transgression about the Sabbath until <HI>Moses,</HI> yet in his tenth Page, he complains,
<PB N="15" REF="007622_0171_102BACBA43DD78B0"/>
<Q>It had been <HI>much abused, and prophaned by an abandoned wicked World, and even much and long Violated by God's own professing People.</HI></Q> And much more he saith to the same Effect.</P>
<P>Now whether we ought to join with him to Judge and Blame the World, and God's People also, since God who is the righteous Judge, has not Blamed them at all for pro∣phaning a Sabbath, in all them Thousands of Years, I leave this to the Judgment of all Mankind.</P>
<P>Concerning the Sabbath I have written in full, by Quoting Scriptures both out of the Old Testament and New, as the Reader may see, beginning at my Book, pag. 30. But now I say in short, There is no Com∣mand for the Keeping the First Day of the Week as a Sabbath, neither in the Old Testament, nor in the New: And all that said <HI>Johnson</HI> hath said by way of Question, and Answer, and Argument, Tradition, Reason, Revelation, and his pretended O∣riginal. And if he had said an Hundred Times as much, it would not balance a Command. See Rom. 4.15. <HI>Where no Law is there is no Transgression,</HI> Chap. 5. 13. <HI>Sin is not imputed when there is no Law.</HI> And says the Confession, (which he says, pag. 7, <Q><HI>Perhaps a better they could not</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="007622_0172_102BAC87CDAD1D28"/>
<HI>have found in the whole Christian world.</HI></Q>) pag. 7. <HI>Believe in all divine Worship, it is not enough that this or that Act of Worship is not Forbidden in the Word of God, if it be not Commanded and you per∣form it, you may fear you will be found guilty, &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>And as to his pretended Original, shall we lay aside the Bible as it is Translated into our own Tongue, by so many Transla∣tors, and so often Revised? Read the Ti∣tle, <HI>The Holy Bible, containing the Old Testament, and the New, Newly Translated cut of the Original Tongues, and with the former Translations, diligently Compared and Revised.</HI></P>
<P>And we have God's Testimony to the Truth of it, who both speaks Comfort and Reproof to us by it, as it is now in our Tongue; according to our inward Temp∣tations and Exercises of Mind, of which I am a Witness; and no doubt Thou∣sands besides. Shall we, I say, set all this at Nought, and that which has been counted so great a Privilege, as to have the Scriptures in our own Tongue, and now to take for Truth what one Man tells us is the Meaning of this or the other Scripture in the Original, other ways than it is Translated in our Tongue? Shall we,
<PB N="17" REF="007622_0173_102BACB8400B1008"/>
I say, believe one Man against all the Translators of the Bible? Especially when he Witnesseth for himself to prove his own Argument, Deut. 4.2. <HI>Ye shall not add unto the Word which I Command you, neither shall ye diminish ought from it</HI> Rev. 22.18 <HI>For I Testify unto every Man that heareth the words of the Prophecy of this Book, if any man shall add unto these things, GOD shall add unto him the plagues that are Written in this Book.</HI> Also Gal. 1.8.</P>
<P>Concerning Swearing, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>After said <HI>Johnson</HI> has Cited <HI>Mat. 5.34, &amp;c.</HI> and Repeated Christ's Words, <Q>Swear not at all, Neither by Heaven, for it is God's Throne, nor by the Earth, for it is his Footstool, &amp;c.</Q> And saith he his Apostle <HI>James</HI> to the same purpose, Chap. 5. 12. <Q>But above all Things, my Brethren, Swear not, neither by Heaven, neither by the Earth, neither by any other Oath, &amp;c.</Q> After these Texts of his own Citing, saith, <Q>Now I would ask, Where in these two Places of Scripture Cited, or any other in the New Testa∣ment, are we Forbidden Swearing by the Living and True GOD? &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="007622_0174_102BAC8A60949380"/>
Answer,</P>
<P>By these Two Texts cited, compared with Mat. 23.22. <HI>And he that shall Swear by Heaven, Sweareth by the Throne of God, and by Him that Sitteth thereon.</HI> I say, it evidently appears we are Forbidden to Swear by the Living and True GOD.</P>
<P>After this he goes on to prove the Lawfulness of an Oath; but I think these Scriptures cited, with what is said already, is sufficient to convince those that are wil∣ling to see; and they that are not, it doth not lie in the multitude of Words to help them.</P>
<P>Concerning Baptism,</P>
<P>We have no Command, nor Example throughout the New-Testament, for Bap∣tising by pouring, or sprinkling Water upon the Person, nor for Baptising Infants of believing Parents, though said <HI>Johnson <Q>says much for it by way of Argument and Reasoning, and pleads for it in the room of Circumcision.</Q></HI> Yet all that he hath said makes no Proof; but let the Reader Read what I have Writ∣ten, together with his Answer, and Judge as he pleases.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="007622_0175_102BACBC45E9CB40"/>
In pag. 26, said <HI>Johnson</HI> says, <Q>Where in all the Scripture do we find the Cog∣nizance, or Notice of the civil Ruler Limited, or Restrained to things Tem∣poral only?</Q></P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>We Read, Gen. 49.10. <HI>The Scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a Law∣giver from between his Feet until Shiloh come, and unto him shall the gathering of the People be;</HI> and whereas 'tis said, <HI>The Scepter shall not depart from Judah, &amp;c.</HI> That is, the typical Kingdom, and Laws should be given to them to Rule by, and to continue 'till CHRIST's Coming. And whereas 'tis said, <HI>and to him shall the gathering of the People be;</HI> That is, by Faith, that he might Rule, and Go∣vern them in Righteousness, and in Peace. Also, Luk. 1.32, 33. <HI>The LORD shall give unto him the Throne of his Fa∣ther David, and he shall Reign over the House of Jacob for ever, and of his King∣dom there shall be no end.</HI></P>
<P>So it appears there was no Power giv∣en to other Kings to Rule in matters of Religion before CHRIST came; but only to them Kings, and Priests which
<PB N="20" REF="007622_0176_102D74F1ACBA2A30"/>
were types of CHRIST; and now CHRIST is come there is no Kings to Rule over his Church in matters of Religion, but only CHRIST Himself, who is their alone King, Priest and Pro∣phet, to Rule, and Teach them.</P>
<P>Further says <HI>Johnson,</HI> <Q>Are not civil Rulers to Punish evil doers, Encourage, and Reward them that do well?</Q></P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>Not in matters of Religion, but only in temporal Things; for both the pu∣nishments, and rewards of the civil Ru∣lers are all Temporal, and CHRIST has left no Rule for any of his Church, so to Rule one over another: But his Com∣mand is contrary. Luke 22.25, &amp;c. <HI>And he said unto them, The Kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them; and they that exercise authority upon them, are called Benefactors. But ye shall not be so; but he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, at he that serveth? is not he that sitteth at meat? but I am among you as he that serveth;</HI> also Matt. 20.25. <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="007622_0177_102D77545889B530"/>
We ought to consider that the Rulers, that the Apostles <HI>Peter,</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> have Com∣manded us to submit our selves to, were Heathen, that worshipped Idols; and both these Apostles suffered Death for not submitting to the same Rulers in matters of Religion; and so did many Thousands more, by which it is ma∣nifest the Apostles did not mean to Command us to obey Magistrates in matters of Religion, but only as the Apostles did themselves, in temporal Things, to <HI>follow peace with all men,</HI> &amp;c. Heb. 12.14.</P>
<P>Said <HI>Johnson</HI> also says, <Q><HI>The Characters of such as are disturbers of the Peace, and disorderly in the State, are such as despise Government, speak Evil of Dignities, who walk after the Flesh, Presumptu∣ous, Self-willed,</HI> &amp;c. and for proof he quotes. 2 Pet. 2 10, and onward.</Q></P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>There is more Characters of false-Teachers in this Chapter; in the 3d Ver. tis said,—<HI>Through Covetousness shall they With feigned Words make merchandise of you.</HI> In the 14th Ver. tis said, <HI>Having
<PB N="22" REF="007622_0178_102D74F372A07300"/>
Eyes full of Adultetry, and that cannot cease from Sin,</HI> &amp;c. that is, they were adulterated from GOD, and lived in Sin, and were not cleansed from all Sin as GOD'S Children are I John 1.7.</P>
<P>In the 15 v. 'tis said, <HI>They are gone astray, following the way of Balaam, who lov∣ed the wages of unrighteousness:</HI> All these are Marks of false Teachers, al∣so in ver. 19, it is shewed that while they Preach unto others they themselves are the Servants of Corruption; and it may well be said as in. ver. 10, <HI>They walk af∣ter the Flesh,</HI> when they live in such co∣vetous Practices. 'Tis said, <HI>They despise Gevernment,</HI> that is the Government that CHRIST hath set in the Church, they despise. 'Tis also said, <HI>They are not afraid to speak evil of Dignities,</HI> that is, them which are in dignity, under CHRIST in the Church they are not afraid to speak evil of. Thus it appears, false Teachers were then, as they are now, speaking evil of the things they know not, despising the Ministers of CHRIST which are made overseers of the Church by the HOLY GHOST, Acts 20.28.</P>
<P>Pag. 27. said <HI>Johnson</HI> says, <Q>Paul di∣rects Timothy to pray for Kings, and
<PB N="23" REF="007622_0179_102D7140C4ADEBF8"/>
for all that are in Authority, that un∣der their happy Influence and Govern∣ment we may lead quiet, and peaceable Lives,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P><HI>Paul</HI> says nothing about happy <HI>Influence and Government;</HI> but he exhorts to Pray for all Men, one as well as another saying, <HI>This is Good, and Acceptable in the sight of GOD our Saviour, who will have all Men to be Saved, and to come to the knowlege of the Truth,</HI> 1 Tim. 2.1, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Said <HI>Johnson</HI> saiths, Pag. 27. <Q>It is Prophesied concerning the Gentile Church and the Church in the Gospel Day: <HI>Isa.</HI> 49. 23. That Kings shall be their nursing Fathers, and Queens their nursing Mothers.</Q></P>
<P>Answer.</P>
<P>This was concerning their return out of Captivity, and was fulfilled in that Day by <HI>Cyrus</HI> and others, whom God raised up to be their nursing Fathers, and nursing Mothers: Also Hag. 2.7. &amp;c. 'tis said, <HI>I will shake all Nation,

and the desire of all Nations shall come, and I will fill this House with Glory saith the LORD of Hosts: The Silver is mine, and the Gold is mine, saith the LORD of Hosts: The Glory of this House shall be greater than the former saith the LORD of Hosts.</HI> Thus it appears, that GOD found ways to restore them with Silver, and Gold, and all things needful to build his House, with the Govern∣ment, and Prist-hood also, which the Scripture shews were all Typical, and were to continue 'till CHRIST came; but now in the Gospel 'tis said, Heb. 3.6. <HI>CHRIST as a Son over his own House, whose House art we,</HI> &amp;c. And the Faith he works in us is much more precious than Gold that Perisheth, I Pet. 1.7. But if it were a Promise that Kings should be their nursing Fathers, and Queens their nursing Mothers in the Gospel Day, when has it been fulfilled? We know that the Apostles and primi∣tive Christians endured much Persecution; and the Reformers out of Popery endu∣red Much Persecution; and our fore Fathers endured Persecution in EN∣GLAND and therefore came into a de∣sart Land, but when GOD Tent his Messengers to reform our Fathers,
<PB N="25" REF="007622_0181_102D71429282BD30"/>
they were also Persecuted, and this hath been the practice to this Day, as the Scripture saith, <HI>He that will live Godly in CHRIST JESUS shall suffer Per∣secution,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.12.</P>
<P>One who felt the Persecution in <HI>New-England,</HI> saith thus,</P>
<LG>
<L>'<HI>New-England</HI> for Religion did leave her native Land,</L>
<L>'And came into a desart amongst a <HI>Taw∣ny Band:</HI></L>
<L>'And surely for Religion, she made this Resolution,</L>
<L>'To come and leave her native Place to shun her Persecution:</L>
<L>'But soon she turns to Persecute, by which it does appear,</L>
<L>'That she is not the same she was when first she did come here:</L>
</LG>
<P>And truly <HI>New-England</HI> has shewed; more bitter Spirit of Persecution than any other part of the Kingdom, by Perse∣cuting the Quakers in a more cruel man∣ner, even unto Death.</P>
<P>Further saith <HI>Johnson,</HI> <Q>Is the civil Ruler to be a terror to evil doers?
<PB N="26" REF="007622_0182_102D74F6F1337198"/>
is be a revenger to execute Wrath up him that doth Evil?</Q></P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>When he hath purged all evil doers out of the Common-wealth, we may hope he will find none in the Church. And as for Blasphemy, the civil Ruler had need be very careful lest as the <HI>Jews</HI> who Persecuted CHRIST for Blasphemy, he also Persecute him in his Members. <HI>Paul</HI> and the Martyrs Worshipped GOD in the way which their Persecutors called Heresie; and as to the many other er∣roneous Principles, or Doctrines, said <HI>Johnson</HI> has named the civil Ruler may now be as liable to be mistaken as others were before him.</P>
<P>Said <HI>Johnson</HI> saith, Pag. 28. <Q>Who then dare be so bold as to put asunder, what GOD hath joined together?</Q> (meaning the Church, and civil Rulers.)</P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>The Church of CHRIST is joined to himself who is her Head, <HI>Eph.</HI> 5.23. and over which he ought to Rule: But both Himself and his Church have been
<PB N="27" REF="007622_0183_102D714C5096B440"/>
Persecuted, even to this Day: As it was fore-told by him, and his Apostles; and it hath been the Practice of the false Church, to join with the Rulers to strive to put CHRIST, and his Church asunder whom GOD hath joined to∣gether.</P>
<P>Said <HI>Johnson</HI> further saith, <Q><HI>Who dare be so brazen Fac'd, and lost to all Medesty as to say, the civil Ruler has nothing to do with the Church?</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>It was a brazen Face in the Ru∣lers, and Teachers at all Times when they have presumed to sit in CHRIST's Seat to Judge in cases of Consci∣ence, or things relating to the Worship of GOD. And now since more Light is come into the World, it is more brazen Fac'd for Teachers to encourage the Rulers any longer there∣in.</P>
<P>And further said <HI>Johnson</HI> Complains, <Q><HI>That I have Justified two of the Qua∣kers for going Naked,</HI></Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="007622_0184_102D74F889DF09E0"/>
Answer,</P>
<P><HI>Isaiah</HI> went Naked, <HI>Isa.</HI> 20.2, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And as to what I have said that two Women went Naked, and both as Signs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> I desire the Reader to peruse be∣ginning at my 116 Pag. and also Com∣pare what I have Written with what <HI>Cotton Mather</HI> doth Testify in the fol∣lowing Pages of the <HI>Indians</HI> Cruelty, in Stripping <HI>New-England</HI> Captives, and Whipping them as Cruelly as said two Women were Whip't by the Rulers of <HI>New-England.</HI></P>
<P>Said <HI>Johnson</HI> in Pag. 28. saith, <Q><HI>Has the civil Ruler nothing to do with ri∣otous and infamous Persons,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Par∣ticularly,</HI> Thomas Newhouse, <HI>who went into the Meeting House at</HI> Boston, <HI>with two great glass Bottles, which be brake one against another in face of the Con∣gregation, and said, thus will the LORD break you in pieces.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Answer,</P>
<P>See <HI>Jerem.</HI> 19.10. 11. <HI>George Wilson</HI> also <HI>Went through the Streets of</HI> Boston <HI>Crying with a loud Voice, That the
<PB N="29" REF="007622_0185_102D714E62B41438"/>
LORD was coming forth with Fire, and Sword to plead with</HI> Boston. And many more of the Quakers Tcstisied publickly to the same purpose, and the Judgments of GOD followed soon af∣ter, as <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> and others of their own Teachers have Recorded, as may be seen compared with said Qua∣kers Testimonies, in a Book put forth by <HI>John Whiting,</HI> in Answer to <HI>Cot∣ton Mather,</HI> Pag. 185, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>But said Teachers did not conisider that GOD had Warned them by his Messengers whom they had Mock∣ed, and Despised, as <HI>Israel</HI> did of old. See 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> 36. ver. 15, 16, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="quotations">
<P>AND here followeth some of said Warnings, and Testimonies, and also some of the Judgments of GOD as they are to be seen in said Book, Writ∣ten by <HI>John Whiting</HI> in Answer to <HI>Cotton Mather,</HI> Printed, 1702, from Pag. 185. to Pag. 212. Which is as followeth.</P>

<Q><HI>Fr.

<P><Q>Thus Reader, thou mayst see how they go on, adding Iniquity to Sin, not at all Considering that the Rod of God is lifted up over them, who will assuredly take Vengeance, for all these Works; therefore let all, in whom there is any tenderness, and bowels of Love towards our Lord Jesus Christ, deliver themselves from this untoward Generation, by turning with the whole Heart unto the Lord, that so they may be saved from the wrath which is to come upon all these. Things—whose Visitation of Love you have with great

<P><Q><HI>Richard Bellingham</HI> charging them with coming in Contempt to Revile Magistrates and Ministers, and to break all Order in Churches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> threatning to cut off their Ears, they replied You heap false Accusations upon us, and God will heap his Judgments on your heads; and if we suffer loss of Members, or loss of Life, our Blood will be required at your Hands, for the Lord hath sent us hither.—Sure∣ly God will take Vengeance for these Things, for whose Blood God will make Inquisition, and in that Day you will be found Guilty, and it re∣quired at your Hands, with a Voice more loud than all the rest of your crying Sins, for which ye must Ac∣count.</Q></P>

<P><Q><HI>J.

<P><Q><HI>Hump.

<P><Q><HI>Isaac Pennington,</HI> There is a time of Righteous Judgment, wherein the most inward Covers shalI be ripped off, and the Sinner appear what he is; and then the Persecutor shall bear that Shame, that Burden, that Misery, which is the Portion of that Spirit.—But the same Lord God of Truth and Righteousness, who hath unmasked the Papists, and unmasked the Bishops, will unmask these also, and their Na∣kedness shall more appear than the o∣thers, who would hide themselves, and their own Cruelty, with that Covering which they themselves judged in O∣thers.—The Lord also will judge between Cattle and Cattle; and in that day ye will see, that as his Choice have heen your Outcast, so your Choice is rejected by him; and that as his Spirit is the Abomination of your Eyes,

<P><Q>P. 88. c. 1. That God hath a Con∣troversie with his <HI>New-England</HI> People, is undeniable; the Lord having Writ∣ten his Displeasure in dismal Characters against us, though Personal Afflictions do often times come only or chiefly for Probation, yet as to publick Judg∣ments, it is not wont to be so, Espe∣cially when by a Continued series of Providence the Lord doth appear and plead against his people, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 21.1. as with us it hath been from Year to Year; would the Lord have whetted his Glittering Sword, and his Hand have taken hold on Judgment? Would he have sent such a mortal Contagion, like a Besom of Destruction, in the midst of us? Would he have said, Sword go through the Land, and Cut

have every Hour look'd when they should be themselves roasted alive, to make a Feast and a Sport for the Hor∣rid Cannibals. Need I tell you that those Devils Incarnate, have tyed their Captives unto Trees, and first cutting off their Ears, have made them to eat their own Ears, and then have broyled their whole Bodies with slow Fires, dancing the mean while about them, and cut∣ting out Collops of their Flesh, till with lingring Tortures they have martyr'd them to Death: Such things have been done by the Inhamane Salvages upon our Captives, that it is a sort of Inhuma∣nity barely to mention them.</Q></P>

The God of Heaven a while a-go turned in the Armies of Hell upon us; and in that matchless Dis∣pensation of God, we underwent a bit∣ter Destruction from the Poyson of the Serpents of the Dust. But there are other points not a few, wherein the Great God hath heaped Mischiefs upon us, and fulfill'd unto us, that holy Commination, Ezek. 7.26. <HI>Mischief shall come upon Mischief:</HI> What shall I say, while the <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> hath been against us?

our dead Friends, that have been bu∣ried in the Ocean.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Moreover, you may observe, that in these Years, those very Things which were intended for our Defence, have oftentimes been so much im∣proved for our Damage, that it was hard for us to say, which was the Greater, the Defence, or the Damage which we had from them. It was a lamentable time with the <HI>Jews,</HI> when that Curse came upon them, <HI>That which should have been for their Wel∣fare, Let it become a Trap, and pour cut thine Indignation upon them.</HI> Tru∣ly the Indignation of God hath been poured out upon us in this Fruit of the Curse, no less frequently than sensi∣bly.</Q>—</P>
<P><Q>Finally, you may observe what <HI>un∣timely Ends,</HI> and what <HI>surprizing Fales,</HI> have come upon our <HI>Sons,</HI> in these <HI>Years of the Wrath of the right Hand of the most High.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>C. 2. Truly, Sirs, our time of War, has in various ways of Mortali∣ty, been imbittered with this Remark, <HI>The Fathers have been burying their Sons all the Country over;</HI> many of us

<P><Q>Thus in our long War we have seen those Changes on all Hands, and in all Kinds, which have witnessed a∣gainst us the dreadful Indignation of God, — And a wise Observation of these things will cause you to see, <HI>That the War which hath been upon us hath been a War of God:</HI> The <HI>Indians</HI> have been but a small part of those <HI>Armies</HI> which the Great God hath been bringing out against us for <HI>ten Years</HI> together; and we may con∣clude, that all the Land have been more or less concerned in those Crimes, for which the Almighty God hath been with these <HI>Armies</HI> managing his Controversie with us.</Q></P>
<P><Q>P. 114. c. 1. Ah! <HI>New-England,</HI> thy Father hath been spitting in thy Face

with most humbling Dispensations; God hath been bringing of thee down to sit in the Dust; when the War commenc'd, <HI>New-England</HI> might say, My God will humble me.—Should a Child of yours be Refractory, and you, Sir, should bid a <HI>Negro,</HI> or an <HI>Indian</HI>-Slave, in your House, <HI>Go, take that Child, and scourge him till you fetch Blood of him?</HI> Surely this would be to <HI>humble him unto the uttermost.</HI> Thus doth thy God <HI>humble thee,</HI> O <HI>New-England!</HI> by putting thee over into the vile Hands of those, which are <HI>not a People,</HI> but <HI>a foolish Nati∣tion.</HI></Q></P>

<P><Q>Is it not a very humbling Thing, that we should have <HI>Evil pursuing of us</HI> at such a rate, that in other Lands afar off, and on the <HI>Exchange</HI> in <HI>Lon∣don,</HI> Strangers have made this Reflecti∣on, <HI>Doubtless</HI> New-England <HI>is a Coun∣try in ill Terms with Heaven?</HI> But so <HI>our God has humbled us.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>What shall I say?

But thus, our God, thou hast humbled us; and shewn us great and fore Troubles, and brought us down into the depth of the Earth.—But if you will <HI>wisely Observe these things,</HI> you will now <HI>get up, and sanctifie your selves, and put away the accursed thing

<P><Q>As it is much to be doubted they are not, by their persis;ting in their Abuses and Revilings against the Peo∣ple of God, to the uttermost of their Power, to this very Day, as appears by his History, and other scurrilous Books, that he and others have writ∣ten of late times, against the Truth and its Friends, whom they still make the People of their Indignation, which is no Sign of any True Repentance of their Murders and Persecutions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Now the Query that naturally a∣rises from all these Premisses, is, Why <HI>New-England</HI> should be so Afflicted and Punished, as they have been, more than other Countries, if they had not provoked the Lord in a greater manner than many other Coun∣tries have done, in respect of Perse∣cution? Let them not think to Ex∣cuse themselves by that in <HI>Luke</HI> 13.2. for that will not serve their turns, in∣asmuch
<PB N="69" REF="007622_0225_102D74EF4A695820"/>
as it is plain, they have been greater Sinners, in that respect, than most, yea, than any called Protestants, that I know of.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Let them look upon all the <HI>English</HI> Plantations round about them, and see if they can find any Compare, as to Persecution, or the Judgments that have followed; I say, that <HI>New-England,</HI> above all others, should be a Land of Judgment, and not of Mercy, must needs Argue, that there is a Cause for it, more than Ordinary.</Q></P>
<P><Q>I doubt not, but most other Coun∣tries are Guilty of other Sins, as well as Them, (Except Hypocris;ie and Persecution to that Degree as they are) and yet they have not been punished in so Eminent a Manner as <HI>New-England;</HI> which shews that Per∣s;ecution is a Capital Sin; and that tho'
<HI>C. M.</HI> hath confessed largely their other Sins, as well as their Judg∣ments; and also, in pretence, prest an Enquiry into the Cause of it, as if there might be some further Cause of their Affliction, than they have yet found out; yet its plain they have
<PB N="70" REF="007622_0226_102D751F990F0230"/>
not yet pitch'd on the Right, or confest the Chief Sins of it, <HI>viz:</HI> Their Persecutions, and Murthers; <HI>and that the accursed things,</HI> as he says, <HI>still remains among them. — These</HI> (as Sir WALTER RALEIGH says) <HI>were the lovers of other Mens Miseries; and Misery found them out.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>And I cannot but observe, that most of those Judgments that have come upon them, have been since they put our Friends to Death; as any may see, if they will peruse <HI>Inc. Mather</HI>'s History of <HI>Remarkable Provi∣dences,</HI> and this <HI>Cotton</HI>'s History of <HI>New-England,</HI> wherein the Reader will find very few, if any, before the Year 1659. the time of putting the first of our Friends to Death, or at least before the beginning of their Per∣secution; which still renders it and them the more Criminal, by the Judg∣ments that have followed; of which the Loss of their Charter (having forfeited it, by denying of Appeals to <HI>England,</HI> in case of Life, and Tryals by Juries, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> according to it) is none of the least; of the Consequen∣ces

<P><Q>Book II. p. 19. 20. Which is the more to be taken notice of, in that they could never obtain the Resto∣ration of it, even in the Reign of King WILLIAM (though so many others were Restored) and so they must come to submit to the Fate of other Persecutors, to be Ruled over by others in their turns (for Persecution and Tyranny is commonly short-Liv'd) who would have Ruled, and Tyran∣nized over others; which, with all the other Judgments that have fol∣lowed them, above-recited, makes up a Scence of Tragedies, that I have hardly Read of the like in any Story, but that of the Jews, for Murdering CHRIST the SON OF GOD, that came to Save them; the Consequences of which was so Dismal and Deplorable, that one would Think it should have been sufficient Warning to Deter any from following their Steps, in Perse∣cuting His Followers. <HI>But as it was then, he that was Born after the Fles;h, Persecuted him that is Born after the Spirit, ever so it is now,</HI> Gal. 4.29.

<HI>And all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer Persecution,</HI> 2 Tim. 3.12. <HI>For unto you it is given, in the behalf of Christ, not only to Believe on Him, but also to Suffer for His sake,</HI> Phil. 1.29. <HI>Nevertheless, it is a Righteous Thing with God, to Recompence Tribu∣lation to them that Trouble you; and to them who are Troubled, Rest,</HI> 2 Thes. 1.6.</Q></P>
<P><Q>These Things I do not Write, I can Truly say, that I Rejoice in them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to Vaunt over them; For I am Heartily Sorry for the Occasion, and them that gave it; nor should I have brought them up, or mentioned it a∣gainst them, did they not still Appear in the same Spirit: And had not the said <HI>C. Mather</HI> still Endeavoured to set himself as an Adversary against GOD's Truth and People, by Abusing of us as he hath done; so that it's justly Improved against them, as a Check to their Envy. And I hope none that are of a better Mind, will be Offended at my plain Dealing with them; for to use his own Terms, <HI>The Catholick Spirit of Communion where∣with 'tis Written, and the Liberty which

I have taken to tax the Schismatical Impositions and Persecutions of a Party, who have always been as real Ene∣mies to the</HI> English Nation, <HI>as to the Christian and Protestant Interest.</HI> So that it's only against such that it is intended; and to lay it before them whom it doth concern, that they may come to a sight of their Sin, and Repent, that the LORD may shew them Mercy, and remove his Judgments from them, which I tru∣ly desire, if it be the Will of the LORD; and that others also may behold, and take notice of the Judgments that have come upon them, for their Persecution and Cru∣elty to the LORD's People, and may Glorifie GOD and say, <HI>G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> and Marvellous are thy Works, LORD, GOD ALMIGHTY; Just and True are thy Ways, thou King of Saints: Who shall not Fear thee, Oh LORD! and Glorify thy Name — for thy Judgments are made mani∣fest?</HI> Rev. 15, 3, 4.</Q></P>
<P><Q>And that they and all others may take Warning, and Hear, and Fear, and do no more so Wickedly,

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>FRiend <HI>Bolles,</HI> Corrected one Mistake, in his Copy (which he let me know of) before 'twas Printed; viz. <HI>That the Savoy Confession, was Composed by those who put the Quakers to Death, at</HI> Boston; Instead of which, he put <HI>was agreed to.</HI> He also Moderated another (which he didn't let me know of, 'till his Performance, and my An∣swer to it, were Publish'd) viz. Instead of saying, <HI>he should prove the</HI> whole <HI>Confession erroneous,</HI> &amp;c. He put, <HI>he should prove the Confession so.</HI> There is I confess, something that appears Ingenuous, and Commendable in these Corrections, as far as they go: But then observe, he still continues notwithstan∣ding, to condemn the Confession, by the Lump; which carries an ill Face enough; especially since he offers no Proof, or Evi∣dence that I can see, but only his say-so. He seems hardly willing to own a Christian Sabbath, because <HI>Mia Sabbatoon</HI> in our Translation, is render'd <HI>First Day of the Week, &amp; not First-Day-Sabbath,</HI> as the O∣riginal speaks. Had he paid as much Def∣erence, to the Assemby that compos'd the Confession, as he seems to do to the Trans∣lators of the Bible, we had found him un∣doubtedly
<PB REF="007622_0233_102D752744FEA408"/>
pleading for, rather than Cavel∣ling at the Confession. He seems unwilling to believe, Swearing by the <HI>Name of the Lord</HI> is Lawful; because Swearing by the <HI>Temple,</HI> by <HI>Heaven,</HI> &amp;c. is a kind of Swearing by GOD, the Form of which is forbidden. He says the Prophecy, concerning the blessed state of the Church in the latter Day, <HI>Isai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> 49.23. was fulfill'd, in the Reduction of the <HI>Jews out of Babilon by Cyrus:</HI> But who can poslibly believe it, that Reads and Com∣par's ver, 6. with the 22. of the same Chap∣ter? But enough: More might be said, if thought expedient,</P>

<P><HI>N.
