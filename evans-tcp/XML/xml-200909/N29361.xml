<HEAD>WILLIAM RILEY's COURTSHIP.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>PART FIRST.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>RISE up you William Riley and come along with me,</L>
<L>I mean for to go with you and leave this country;</L>
<L>I will leave my Father's dwelling, fine houses &amp; free land,</L>
<L>And away goes Wm. Riley and his dearest Collian Band.</L>

<HEAD>II.</HEAD>
<L>It was over lofty hills &amp; mountains and to its lonesome plain,</L>
<L>Through shady groves and vallies her company to obtain;</L>
<L>But her father followed after with his well armed band,</L>
<L>And so taken was poor Riley &amp; his dearest Collian Band.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="3">
<HEAD>III.</HEAD>
<L>And home she was sent and into her closet bound,</L>
<L>So taken was poor Riley and sent to Slago town</L>
<L>To stand the bar of justice before the judge to stand,</L>
<L>And for nothing but for stealing of his dearest Collian Band.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="4">
<HEAD>IV.</HEAD>
<L>O now I am confin'd in jail, my hands &amp; feet are bound,</L>
<L>I'm hand-cuff'd like a murderer &amp; chained to the ground,</L>
<L>But for all my toil and slavery I'm willing for to stand,</L>
<L>And still in hopes to be saved by my dearest Collian Band.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="5">
<HEAD>V.</HEAD>
<L>O then came the jailer's son to Riley where he lay,</L>
<L>Saying dress yourself young Riley, you must appear this day</L>
<L>Before 'squire Folgier's anger, before the judge to stand,</L>
<L>And for nothing but for stealing of his dearest Collian Band,</L>
</LG>
<LG N="6">
<HEAD>VI.</HEAD>
<L>Then he dreft himself in a suit of green most lovely to behold,</L>
<L>His hair hung down his shoulders like yellow links of gold,</L>
<L>He's neat and trim in every limb, most lovely to be seen,</L>
<L>He's a match for Folgier's daughter was she equal to a queen.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="7">
<HEAD>VII.</HEAD>
<L>These are the last words Riley, that I have heard them say</L>
<L>The lady's oath will hang you or she will set you free;</L>
<L>If that be so says Riley, with pleasure I will stand,</L>
<L>Still hoping to be saved by my dearest Collian Band.</L>

<LG N="8">
<PB N="4" REF="039103_0004_1013C31B2A14DB90"/>
<HEAD>VIII.</HEAD>
<L>O then spake her father saying, take pity now on me,</L>
<L>This fellow came among us to disgrace my family;</L>
<L>This impudent inferior I'am not fit to stand,</L>
<L>O I'll have the life of Riley or I'll leave sweet Ireland.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="9">
<HEAD>IX.</HEAD>
<L>Then up steps the noble Fox (the table he stood by)</L>
<L>Saying gentlemen of the jury look on his extremity;</L>
<L>To hang a man for love, 'tis murder you may see,</L>
<L>O spare the life of Riley, let him leave his country.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="10">
<HEAD>X.</HEAD>
<L>O the lady being sensible, though in her tender youth,</L>
<L>If Riley has deluded her she must declare the truth:</L>
<L>Then like a moving beauty before him she did stand,</L>
<L>You're welcome in my heart's delight, my dearest Collian Band.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="11">
<HEAD>XI.</HEAD>
<L>O you gentlemen of the jury look on his extremity,</L>
<L>The blame is not in Riley, the fault is all in me;</L>
<L>I caus'd him thus to leave his place &amp; come along with me,</L>
<L>I lov'd him out of measure, which prov'd my destiny.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="12">
<HEAD>XII.</HEAD>
<L>O then spake the noble Fox, and let this prisoner go,</L>
<L>The lady's oath has clear'd him the jury well may know;</L>
<L>The lady's oath has clear'd him, she hath renew'd his name,</L>
<L>Her honor great may raise his estate &amp; always be to fame,</L>
</LG>
<LG N="13">
<HEAD>XIII.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis true my Lord he stole from her, her jewels &amp; rings,</L>
<L>Besides her silver watch and many precious things,</L>
<L>Which cost me in bright guineas above five hundred pounds,</L>
<L>O I'll have the life of Riley if I spend ten thousand pounds.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="14">
<HEAD>XIV.</HEAD>
<L>'Tis true my Lord I gave them him in token of true love,</L>
<L>And since we are a parting I will them all remove,</L>
<L>If you have got them Riley, pray send them back to me;</L>
<L>I will my lady with many thanks to thee.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="15">
<HEAD>XV.</HEAD>
<L>O but there is one among them I allow yourself to wear,</L>
<L>With thirty shining diamonds that's set in silver clear;</L>
<L>And for a token of true love wear it on your right hand,</L>
<L>That you may think on my broken heart when you're in a foreign land.</L>

<HEAD>PART SECOND.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>YOU tender hearted lovers attend unto my theme,</L>
<L>The hardship of William Riley I mean for to explain;</L>
<L>Who for stealing of an heiress a trial he did stand,</L>
<L>And sentenced to be transported into a foreign land.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="17">
<HEAD>(XVII.)</HEAD>
<L>The daughter of squire Folgier this lady prov'd to be,</L>
<L>Which caused William Riley this sad calamity,</L>
<L>And maketh him in sorrow to sigh, weep and bewail,</L>
<L>And loaded with cold irons, confin'd in Slago jail.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="18">
<HEAD>(XVIII.)</HEAD>
<L>Like to a malefactor, transported he must be,</L>
<L>His lady cries my jewel your face I ne'er shall see;</L>
<L>Cruel hard hearted father, you are the only one</L>
<L>That banish'd Wm. Riley from his dearest Collian Band.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="19">
<HEAD>(XIX.)</HEAD>
<L>Her father in a rage thus unto her did say,</L>
<L>For your underhanded dealing I soon will you convey,</L>
<L>Into a lonesome chamber where you'll repent this deed,</L>
<L>Twelve months on bread &amp; water I mean you there shall feed</L>
</LG>
<LG N="20">
<HEAD>(XX.)</HEAD>
<L>And then into a chamber his daughter he did hide,</L>
<L>With course sheets and blankets, and straw thereon to lie:</L>
<L>She cries, sweet William Riley, 'tis for my sake alone,</L>
<L>That you in grief and sorrow in Slago jail do mourn.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="21">
<HEAD>(XXI.)</HEAD>
<L>Three nights she in her chamber in grief &amp; sorrow spent,</L>
<L>And by her father's cruelty she to distraction went;</L>
<L>She wrung her hands and tore her hair, crying my dearest dear,</L>
<L>You're used by my father most vile, sharp and severe.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="22">
<HEAD>(XXII.)</HEAD>
<L>He into Bedlam then did send this lady straight,</L>
<L>Resolving that she never more should see her mate,</L>
<L>But in her chains to rattle, weep, lament and rave,</L>
<L>And cry sweet Wm. Riley, you'll be sold for a slave.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="23">
<HEAD>(XXIII.)</HEAD>
<L>She cri'd sweet Wm. Riley, if I could now you see,</L>
<L>I from my father's anger would soon set you free;</L>
<L>I would enclose you in my arms, from me you ne'er should part</L>
<L>Though I lie here in Bedlam, young Riley has my heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="24">
<PB N="6" REF="039103_0006_1013C3206E487320"/>
<HEAD>(XXIV.)</HEAD>
<L>We now will leave this lady to sigh, weep and bewail,</L>
<L>And turn unto young Riley confin'd in Slago jail;</L>
<L>Who with twenty-seven criminals to Dublin's sent away,</L>
<L>Expecting to be transported into Botany Bay.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="25">
<HEAD>(XXV.)</HEAD>
<L>When into Dublin they arrived they all were sent to jail,</L>
<L>Until the transport ship should be prepared for to sail:</L>
<L>Poor Riley cries, 'squire Folgier, cruel hard hearted man,</L>
<L>In Bedlam lies your daughter, my fair Collian Band.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="26">
<HEAD>(XXVI.)</HEAD>
<L>But fortune to poor Riley happen'd to prove kind,</L>
<L>As there he lay confin'd a thought came in his mind;</L>
<L>A petition to the Castle he from the new prison sent</L>
<L>Unto the Lord Lieutenant, whose heart it did relent.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="27">
<HEAD>(XXVII.)</HEAD>
<L>With him into Bedlam straightway he went off hand,</L>
<L>Likewise releas'd his jewel his fair Collian Band;</L>
<L>As soon as this fair lady her truelove did behold,</L>
<L>She in her snowy arms young Riley did enfold.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="28">
<HEAD>(XXVIII.)</HEAD>
<L>Her senses did revive—they for a parson sent,</L>
<L>To marry this young couple to their joy and content;</L>
<L>License from the primate was brought immediately,</L>
<L>And there William Riley was wed to his fair lady.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="29">
<HEAD>(XXIX.)</HEAD>
<L>A feast was then prepared which held for three days,</L>
<L>Success attend young Riley and his fair Collian Band;</L>
<L>Soon as her father heard it his heart it did relent</L>
<L>And cried for my offences I sorely do repent.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="30">
<HEAD>(XXX.)</HEAD>
<L>There is none that can hinder what heaven does decree,</L>
<L>Then straight off to Dublin he rode immediately;</L>
<L>Soon as he into Dublin to the young couple came,</L>
<L>He said my dearest children I have been to blame.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="31">
<HEAD>(XXXI.)</HEAD>
<L>But now you shall live happy with me in Slago Town,</L>
<L>A portion I will give you of thirty thousand pound;</L>
<L>And as it is God's will that I have no child but she,</L>
<L>I'll enjoy you both whilst I live in my own family.</L>
</LG>
<LG N="32">
<HEAD>(XXXII.)</HEAD>
<L>And at my death you shall possess my whole estate &amp; land</L>
<L>My blessing on you Riley and your dearest Collian Band.</L>

<HEAD>THE <HI>SHOEMAKER's FAVORITE.</HI>—A NEW SONG.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>VAIN pleasures of this life &amp; allurements I do slight,</L>
<L>With all their enjoyment, each trifling delight;</L>
<L>Every man to his work where his business does call,</L>
<L>And I to my trade with my bristle and my awl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While some are on sick beds, &amp; some there are in health,</L>
<L>While many gain learning, in credit and in wealth,</L>
<L>They may fight for this world, they may quarrel, pull &amp; haul,</L>
<L>But a living I can get with my bristle and my awl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And in the summer time while the weather it is warm,</L>
<L>When farmers are a mowing, or hoeing of their corn,</L>
<L>They being melted down upon the grass will sprawl,</L>
<L>While I all comforts will enjoy with my bristle &amp; my all.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>And in the winter time while the weather's very cold,</L>
<L>The farmers are at work their riches to unfold;</L>
<L>And wading through the snow in the midst of it will fall,</L>
<L>While all pleasure I enjoy with my bristle and my awal.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>While the farmer does consider his condition incomplete</L>
<L>And the study of his life is mechanics for to cheat;</L>
<L>He that would cheat a shoemaker out of his honest pay,</L>
<L>May the d—l take him on his back and carry him away.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In the glory of my prime from the age of seventeen,</L>
<L>To work upon a farm I will never more be seen;</L>
<L>But my time I will spend where the greatest profits call,</L>
<L>And my days I will end with my bristle and my awl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>To a foolish young girl I will never be confin'd,</L>
<L>It disturbs a free hearted, generous mind;</L>
<L>It surrounds us with sorrow while our joy &amp; pleasure fall</L>
<L>And will end all my pleasures with the bristle &amp; the awl.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>We will fill up our glasses and drink a health to those</L>
<L>Who are friends to honest tradesmen, and farmers will op∣pose</L>
<L>A bowl of punch we'll have, not a drop of it shall fall,</L>
<L>And the praises we will sing to the bristle and the awl.</L>

<HEAD>CONTENTMENT.</HEAD>
<L>WHY should we at our lot complain,</L>
<L>Or grieve at our distress;</L>
<L>Some think if they should riches gain,</L>
<L>They'd gain true happiness:</L>
<L>Alas how vain is all their gain,</L>
<L>Since life will soon decay,</L>
<L>And since we're here with friends so dear,</L>
<L>Let's drive all cares away.</L>
<L>Why should the rich despise the poor,</L>
<L>Why should the poor repine;</L>
<L>A little time will make us all</L>
<L>In equal friendship join:</L>
<L>We're much to blame, we're all the same;</L>
<L>Alike we're made of clay,</L>
<L>And since we're here with friends so dear;</L>
<L>Let's drive all cares away.</L>
<L>The only circumstance in life</L>
<L>That ever I could find,</L>
<L>To soften care and temper mirth,</L>
<L>Is sweet content of mind;</L>
<L>With such a store we have much more,</L>
<L>Than e'er we can convey,</L>
<L>And since we're here with friends so dear</L>
<L>Let's drive all cares away.</L>
<L>Let's make the best we can of life,</L>
<L>Nor render it a curse,</L>
<L>But take it as you would a wife</L>
<L>For better or for worse:</L>
<L>Life at the best is but a jest,</L>
<L>A dreary winter's day,</L>
<L>And since we're here with friends so dear,</L>
<L>Let's drive all cares away.</L>
<L>Wher age old creeping age comes on,</L>
<L>And we are young no more,</L>
<L>Let's not repine at what we've done,</L>
<L>Nor grieve that youth is o'er;</L>
<L>But cheerfully as formerly,</L>
<L>Be innocently gay,</L>
<L>And since we're here with friend so dear,</L>
<L>Let's drive all cares away.</L>
