<HEAD>TO JAMES BOWDOIN, <ABBR>Esq</ABBR> Merchant in <HI>Boston.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>Honoured</HI> SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AT your Desire the following <HI>Sermon</HI> is sent to the Press; to YOU therefore I in Form present it. You have also gratified the Desires of others, who wish'd to <HI>read</HI> it after they had heard it. I pray GOD it may be of spiritual Profit to you and them.</P>
<P>GOD <HI>has made his wonderful Works to be remem∣bred: His Work is honourable and glorious, sought out by all them that have Pleasure therein;</HI> which <HI>all</HI> ought to have. At Times therefore we ought to <HI>preach</HI> on this Subject, but always in an <HI>evangelical, scriptural</HI> and spiritual Manner. A <HI>Christian Audience</HI>
<PB N="ii" REF="005155_0004_1016C9540B7F9698"/>should ever be so treated, edified and gratified. I please my self with thinking, it was <HI>this</HI> that gave the <HI>Discourse</HI> it's Force and Acceptance with so many. If now in <HI>reading</HI> it, they or others may find a like Pleasure and <HI>Benefit,</HI> they will thank you, <HI>Sir,</HI> under GOD, as the Hand that conveys it to them.</P>
<P>GOD has set You near the Head of our <HI>Province</HI> for worldly Estate and <HI>Riches;</HI> but the <HI>true Honour</HI> which we wish You, and to all our Brethren of like <HI>superior</HI> worldly Circumstances, <HI>cometh from above the Firmament;</HI> even the Riches of <HI>Grace,</HI> the <HI>endur∣ing Substance,</HI> a Treasure in <HI>Heaven</HI> which faileth not. We are therefore commanded by our LORD and SAVIOUR, to <HI>charge them that are rich in this World, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncertain Riches, but in the</HI> LIVING GOD, <HI>who gives us richly all Things to enjoy: That they do Good, be rich in good Works, ready to distribute, willing to communicate; laying up in Store for themselves a good Foundation against the Time to come, that they may lay hold of eter∣nal Life.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>weekly</HI> SABBATH is the special, reverend and perpetual <HI>Memorial</HI> to us of the Wisdom, <HI>Power</HI> and Goodness of GOD in his Work of CREATION; and a more gracious and solemn <HI>Memorial</HI> thereof could not be given us, for the <HI>Honour</HI> of GOD from us, or for spiritual <HI>Good</HI> to us from GOD.</P>
<P>How necessary is it for us in our fallen State, to be call'd <HI>off</HI> every <HI>Week</HI> from our worldly Works, to a <HI>calm</HI> deliberate and rais'd <HI>Contemplation</HI> of GOD our MARKER, PRESERVER, REDEEMER and SANCTIFIER; in his whole Work of Nature, Providence &amp; Grace! That every <HI>seventh Thought</HI> (as it were) thro' all our Time might be on GOD, and sacred to his <HI>Praise.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="iii" REF="005155_0005_1016C956A0E376D0"/>
Before there could be a <HI>Sabbath</HI> to <HI>Man</HI> on <HI>Earth,</HI> while the LORD was but laying the <HI>Foundation</HI> of it <HI>upon nothing,</HI> the <HI>Angels of</HI> GOD gave <HI>Praise and</HI> Glory; <Q><HI>The Morning Stars sang together, and all the Sons of</HI> GOD <HI>shouted for Joy.</HI></Q> And this is <HI>our</HI> happy <HI>joyous</HI> Exercise, if GOD give a Heart for it, as our <HI>Sabbaths</HI> Return; as the PSALM for the <HI>Sabbath</HI> Day would inspire us; Psal. xcii. <Q><HI>For thou</HI> LORD <HI>hast made me glad thro' thy Work,</HI></Q> <HI>and I will triumph in the Work of thy Hands.</HI></P>
<P>If we are ever <HI>in the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>on our</HI> LORD's-DAYS, and favoured with any <HI>Visions of the</HI> SON OF MAN <HI>in the midst of his Golden Candlesticks,</HI> our thankful <HI>Praises</HI> will ascend to HIM at the FATHER's right Hand, as enter'd into <HI>his Rest</HI> upon his <HI>finishing</HI> the Work of our REDEMPTION, as GOD <HI>ceas'd from his</HI> when the Heavens and the Earth were finished. But we must wait for the <HI>perfect Sabbath,</HI> and the perfect <HI>Praise,</HI> among the <HI>crowned Elders</HI> and adoring <HI>Angels</HI> before the THRONE, Rev. iv. Where they <Q><HI>rest not Day and Night from giving Glory and Honour and Thanks to</HI> HIM <HI>that is upon the Throne, and liveth for ever and ever;</HI></Q> saying, — <Q><HI>For</HI> THOU <HI>hast</HI> CREATED <HI>all Things, and for thy Pleasure they are and were</HI> CREATED.</Q></P>
<P>Sir, My Heart's Desire and Prayer to GOD is, that the SABBATH OF THE LORD may be ever thus holy to HIM in <HI>your Dwelling,</HI> and in all the Families of the <HI>Flock!</HI> That the <HI>Rich</HI> among us in particular may ever give a bright <HI>Example</HI> in this Respect; testifying hereby their <HI>Gratitude</HI> to GOD who gives 'em all Things <HI>richly to enjoy,</HI> pertaining both to <HI>Life and Godliness!</HI> That when the LORD comes to Judgment, and fills our <HI>Firmament</HI> with his dazzling tre∣mendous <HI>Glory;</HI> and the <HI>Rich</HI> and <HI>Poor</HI> stand toge∣ther
<PB N="iv" REF="005155_0006_1016C958F8E6F4A0"/>before HIM, and the <HI>Books</HI> are open'd; it may be then <HI>read</HI> and said—<Q><HI>I know thy Works</HI> of Righ∣teousness and Charity!</Q>
<Q><HI>Come ye blessed of my</HI> FATHER, <HI>inherit the</HI> KINGDOM, <HI>prepared for you from the Foundation of the World; for I was hungry and ye gave me Meat,</HI> &amp;c. For <HI>verily I say unto you, in as much as ye did it unto One of the least of these my Brethren, ye did it unto</HI> ME.</Q></P>
<P>That many, <HI>many</HI> of the <HI>High and Low</HI> together, from every worshiping <HI>Assembly</HI> in this great <HI>Town;</HI> may <HI>then</HI> meet and share in this BENEDICTION, and be unto <HI>each other,</HI> and to their faithful <HI>Ministers</HI> for a <HI>Crown of Rejoycing,</HI> is the Prayer of him who is with great and sincere <HI>Esteem,</HI></P>

<P>The <HI>Reason</HI> of my bringing you <HI>these</HI> Words this Morning is, because we have again finished the reading the Book of <HI>Psalms</HI> to you in our <HI>Lord's-Day</HI> Morning Exercise: And another Reason is, because the Providence of GOD order us this Afternoon to read to you the <HI>Order of the</HI> GOVERN∣MENT for a Day of PRAISE TO GOD, our yearly <HI>Thanks∣giving-Day.</HI>—O might our Days and Years and Life <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>

<P>We should be daily <HI>praising</HI> GOD in our <HI>Houses,</HI> with our <HI>Families</HI> and in our <HI>Closets;</HI> but <HI>Praises</HI> to GOD must yet be more solemn, public and <HI>reverend</HI> in the <HI>Assemblies of Sion,</HI> in the

<P>And because it is in and by the FIRMAMENT which GOD has spread over and around us, that we behold his <HI>eternal Power</HI> in his Works and read it in his Word, and <HI>live, move and have our Being in</HI> GOD; and because we could neither <HI>see</HI> or <HI>hear</HI> any Thing of GOD without this <HI>Firmament</HI> surrounding us; nor could Day and Night, Heat and Cold, Summer or Winter, Seed-Time and Harvest be known to us without it; nor the LORD GOD in his <HI>Judgments</HI> of Blasting and Mildew, Famine and Pestilences, Lightning and Thunder, Earthquake and Inun∣dation; therefore we are well directed and required in my <HI>Text</HI> more especially to <HI>praise</HI> him for <HI>this,</HI> without which there could be neither <HI>Speech,</HI> Voice nor <HI>Hearing:</HI> "Praise <HI>Him in the Firmament of his Power.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Firmament</HI> in made for Motion, Sight and Sound, Life and Breathing: "<HI>Let every Thing that has Breath</HI> praise GOD in it and for it; as is said after my <HI>Text.</HI> And how could a <HI>Book of Psalms</HI> for <HI>Man</HI> on Earth <HI>end</HI> more properly and comprehensively?

And down into the <HI>Depths</HI> below? thro' <HI>Systems</HI> ten thousand Million Times wider than the <HI>Earth,</HI> and broader than the <HI>Sea!</HI> that I may not therefore, <HI>lose</HI> my self and you in this unsearchable and impassable Tract of <HI>Aether,</HI> wherein our <HI>Sun and Planets, Earth</HI> and <HI>Moon</HI> roll Day and Night, Summer and Winter; and thro' which the <HI>fix'd Stars</HI> twinkle and close our Sight; I will keep to the <HI>sure</HI> WORD OF GOD, the BIBLE in my Hand, and from <HI>that</HI> form my Discourse of the DIVINE POWER in the FIRMAMENT of Heaven, and of the PRAISES due from us to the ALMIGHTY in the Contemplation hereof.</P>
<P>Give me therefore your patient and <HI>raised Attention</HI> while I, 1. Consider the <HI>Firmament</HI> as the <HI>Work of</HI> GOD: 2. The <HI>Power</HI> of GOD it it: And 3. The <HI>Praises</HI> we should render him on this Account.</P>
<P N="1">I. I am to show that <HI>the Firmament</HI> is GOD'S, his <HI>Work;</HI> his <HI>Creation,</HI> his Creature; for he <HI>made</HI> it; it did not <HI>expand</HI> it self; GOD <HI>stretched it out,</HI> and holds it in its wondrous Being; with all the mighty <HI>Worlds</HI> within the vast Circumference. Some of these <HI>Globes</HI> our Eyes can reach, and Art can measure in an imperfect Manner; and what more and greater are beyond our Sight, we may imagine, but can never know in these mortal Bodies.—But whatever this <HI>Space</HI> be; which we call <HI>Firmament,</HI> or whatever <HI>Worlds</HI> like this Earth of ou be contained in it; <HI>Moses</HI> has let us know from GOD, that the LORD himself and alone <HI>made</HI> it, on the <HI>second</HI> Day, by the Word of his <HI>Power;</HI> as he did the <HI>Light</HI> before it, and the <HI>Seas</HI> and dry <HI>Land</HI> after it; For so we read, Gen. 1.6. <HI>And GOD said, "let there be a Firmament, and GOD called the Firmament Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>The Word which we translate Firmament signifies <HI>Extension;</HI> and a vast Extension truly is the visible <HI>Heaven;</HI> that <HI>Region of Air</HI> which appears to our Eyes as a Covering or <HI>Curtain</HI> stretched over us; which is the <HI>Psalmists</HI> humble Representation, in the 104. <HI>Psalm.</HI>—It is properly divided by us into the <HI>lower</HI> and <HI>upper</HI> Region. The <HI>lower</HI> is out <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> a Body of <HI>grosser</HI> Air cleaving to our
<PB N="4" REF="005155_0010_1016B80C20397F18"/>Earth as a <HI>Garment,</HI> and moving with it; in which <HI>we</HI> breathe and move, the <HI>Birds</HI> fly and sing, the <HI>Vapours</HI> rise and fall, the <HI>Clouds</HI> roll, the Dews and <HI>Rains</HI> descend, the <HI>Lightning</HI> and Thunder terrify us: And in the <HI>higher</HI> Regions of this <HI>Atmosphere</HI> there are much more <HI>terrible Metcors</HI> (as the Learned

<P>The Firmament of <HI>Aether</HI> rises from the Bound of this our <HI>Atmosphere</HI> unto the <HI>Sun and fixed Stars;</HI>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><HI>Aether</HI> is that subtle Matter or Medium, much finer and rarer than <HI>Air,</HI> which commencing from the Limits of our <HI>Atmosphere,</HI> possesses the whole heavenly Space.— The Learned cannot conceive the largest Part of the Creation should be perfectly void and therefore fill it with a Species of Matter under this Denomination of Aether, or Aethereal.</Q></NOTE> an unknown and inconceivable <HI>Space;</HI> of which <HI>David</HI> (in∣spired from on <HI>High</HI>) has taught us to sing, Psalm viii. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, 4. <HI>When I consider thy Heavens, the Work of thy Fingers, the Moon and Stars which thou hast ordained; what is Man that thou art mindful of him?

<P><Q>The <HI>Height</HI> of these <HI>Heavens</HI> (says a devout <HI>Ex∣positor</HI>) may mind us of GOD'S <HI>Supremacy;</HI> the Purity and <HI>Brightness</HI> of them of his <HI>Holiness</HI> and Glory; the <HI>Vastness</HI> of them of his <HI>Immensity,</HI> and their <HI>Influence</HI> of his universal <HI>Providence,</HI> and infinite Communica∣tions to us.</Q></P>

But it is the POWER of GOD more especially that I am to consider in this <HI>Expansion</HI> of Aether and Air around us. Wherefore,</P>
<P N="2">II. This POWER of GOD in his FIRMAMENT <HI>(which who can understand?)</HI> commands now our reverend At∣tention: —But <HI>how little a Portion have we heard of it.</HI> Job xxvi. 14.</P>
<P>And <HI>First,</HI> The immeasurable <HI>Extent</HI> and <HI>Comprehension of the Firmament,</HI> the Height and Depth, Length and Breadth of it, speaks the infinite <HI>Power</HI> of GOD: Who with a Word's speaking could spread abroad such an <HI>Ex∣panse</HI> around so many <HI>Spheres</HI> and Worlds, which are themselves of <HI>vast</HI> Dimensions, and yet are all incircled and contain'd therein. <HI>Great is our LORD, and of great</HI> POWER, <HI>his Understanding is infinite,</HI> Psal. cxlvii. 5.</P>
<P>When <HI>Moses</HI> wrote of GOD'S <HI>Power</HI> in the <HI>Sea,</HI> he says—"And GOD created <HI>great Whales;</HI> they being in <HI>Bulk</HI> the greatest of any moving Creature that hath Life: How much more may we admire the great Power of GOD in the Compass of the <HI>Sea</HI> it self? And in that of the <HI>Firmament,</HI> in Comparison whereof the <HI>Sea</HI> is but as a Hand-Breadth. Psal. civ. 1, 2. <HI>O LORD my GOD thou art very great; who stretchest out the Heavens as a Curtain, who coverest thy self with Light as with a Gar∣ment!</HI> Job xxvi. 7. <HI>He stretcheth out the North over the empty Space; and hangeth the Earth upon nothing.</HI> And thus are the <HI>Sun, Moon, Planets</HI> and every <HI>Star</HI> hung in their various Distances: <HI>heavy</HI> Bodies, as they all are, yet they <HI>float</HI> in Air, and keep their Circles.</P>
<P>Very grand and noble are the Words of <HI>Elihu</HI> to <HI>Job;</HI> but according to the
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The ancient <HI>Philosophers</HI> fancied the Heavens to be a <HI>solid</HI> Body and that the <HI>Stars</HI> were fastned therein; and this was perhaps the Notion that <HI>Elihu</HI> had thereof; the <HI>seventy Inter∣preters</HI> accordingly translate the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Word, the <HI>Firm</HI> or <HI>Solid.</HI> Mons. <HI>Saurin</HI> p. 3.—"Yet many of the <HI>Ancients</HI> al∣lowed with the <HI>Moderns</HI> that the Firmament is a <HI>fluid</HI> Body; tho' they that gave it the Denomination of <HI>Firmament,</HI> must doubtless have taken it for a <HI>solid</HI> One. <HI>Chambers Cycloped.</HI></NOTE> <HI>old Philosophy</HI> of his Day and of

<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> The <HI>Power of</HI> GOD is glorious in the <HI>Con∣sistency</HI> and <HI>Strength</HI> of this <HI>Fluid,</HI> which is so much <HI>rarer</HI> than Water, and yet bears about mighty <HI>Clouds</HI> with vast <HI>Burthens</HI> of Water in them; which they <HI>distill abundantly</HI> in the great and small Rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his <HI>Strength:</HI> And altho' the <HI>Fires of GOD</HI> break thro' the midst of these Rains with mighty Force and <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ar,</HI> yet neither is the <HI>Atmosphere</HI> nor the Cloud it self rent; there being an

Chambers.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Elasticity</HI> or <HI>Spring</HI> in the <HI>Air</HI> which insensibly <HI>yeilds to Bodies</HI> in their Motion, and yet <HI>strongly closes</HI> round them and <HI>holds</HI> them in their Motion; which is the wondrous <HI>Power</HI> of GOD exerted in it thro' all <HI>Spaces;</HI> but to us most sensibly (and yet insensibly) in <HI>our own Atmosphere,</HI> which <HI>cleaves</HI> to our Earth and moves with it, even as our Skin or <HI>Clothes</HI> with our Bodies; by which Means we are insensible of the diurnal and annual Motion of our <HI>Earth;</HI> notwith∣standing the Velocity and Force thereof.—The <HI>Pillars</HI> of it seem to <HI>tremble</HI> in the furious <HI>stormy</HI> Season, and the <HI>Atmosphere</HI> appears at Times to be <HI>rending</HI> asunder; but GOD has fastned the <HI>Foundations</HI> of both alike in his own <HI>Power,</HI> and they are preserv'd. The <HI>fair Weather</HI> returns out of the <HI>North, and with GOD is terrible Majesty.</HI> Job xxxvii. 22. All is <HI>calm,</HI> and bright, and soft and easy again, tho' but just now the Deep boiled, the Trees rent, and the very Houses seem'd to reel before the great <HI>Wind,</HI> of God's Strength. Amos v. 8. <HI>Seek him that maketh the Stars and Orion, and turneth the Shadow
<PB N="7" REF="005155_0013_1016C96C2401C9E8"/>of Death into the Morning, and makes the Day dark with Night! Who calls for the Waters of the Sea</HI> (calls 'em <HI>up</HI> into the Air by the gentle Beams of the <HI>Sun</HI>) and then <HI>pours 'em out on the Face of the Earth; the LORD is is his Name: He buildeth his Stories in the Heavens</HI> (or in the FIRMAMENT) <HI>and calls for the Waters of the Sea; the LORD is his Name.</HI> Amos ix. 6.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> The Power of GOD is seen in this <HI>Firmament</HI> of Air about us, in that <HI>our Life</HI> and the Life of all <HI>Animals; "Beasts and all Cattle, creeping Things and flying Fowl,"</HI> is sustained and upheld by this Provision for their common <HI>Breath.</HI> We and all the Creatures round about us <HI>live by Breathing;</HI> we breathe in and out <HI>the Air,</HI> which is therefore truly called <HI>the Breath of Life;</HI> breathed by GOD (as <HI>Moses</HI> tells us) into the <HI>Nostril</HI> of Man in the Day wherein he was created. <HI>Gen.</HI> ii. 7. And the more <HI>easily</HI> Life is continued by this constant <HI>Respiration,</HI> so much the more <HI>wonderful</HI> is the <HI>Power of GOD</HI> therein; who does the greatest and most beneficial Things to and for his Creatures with the greatest Ease.—We breathe without the least <HI>Pains</HI> or Labour, with perfect Ease and <HI>Pleasure</HI> from Day to Day in a State of Health; without thinking of the Breath we draw. The soft Air is sweet and cool to us, <HI>The Breath of the</HI> ALMIGHTY <HI>which gives us Life,</HI> Job xxxiii. 4. i. e. The <HI>Power</HI> of the ALMIGHTY is in it, together with his Goodness; and when HE <HI>gathers to himself the Spirit and the Breath, all Flesh expire.</HI></P>
<P>O the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Goodness</HI> of GOD to us in that <HI>Air</HI> we breathe in! It is the <HI>Firmament of his Power</HI> about us, which <HI>holds our Souls in Life;</HI> for Breath and Spirit stay and go together; Psal. civ. 29. <HI>Thou takest away their Breath, they die and return to their Dust.</HI> cxlvi. 4. <HI>His Breath goes forth, he returns to his Earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> The <HI>Firmament</HI> is the great <HI>Power</HI> of GOD, in respect of the <HI>easy and mighty Motion</HI> that <HI>Bodies</HI> have therein; the greater and the less, higher or heavier, animate or inanimate.</P>

1. MAN <HI>moves upon the Ground with Ease and Safety,</HI> and so the <HI>Creatures</HI> put under his Feet, by reason of the <HI>Equilibrium</HI> or <HI>Balance in the Air,</HI> without which <HI>he</HI> and <HI>they</HI> would <HI>fall</HI> and be <HI>crush'd</HI> to Pieces every Step they take.— So 'tis that <HI>GOD girds us with Strength and makes our Way perfect,</HI> as we read in the xviii. Psalm: <HI>He makes our Feel like Hinds Feet,</HI> and hold us <HI>in our high Places:</HI> The <HI>Sailors</HI> climb the tall <HI>Masts</HI> and run upon the <HI>Ropes;</HI> the <HI>Builders</HI> on the Tops of Houses and on the naked <HI>Rafters,</HI> and are safe; Also <HI>he teaches our Hands to War, and a Bow of Steel is broken by our Arms; his Gentleness makes us great</HI> and his <HI>right Hand holds us up; he enlarges our Steps under us, and our Feet do not slip.</HI> It is all owing to the <HI>Force</HI> and Compression of the <HI>Elastic Air</HI> aroung us, which is the <HI>Power</HI> of GOD in his <HI>Firma∣ment.</HI>—The slow <HI>Ox</HI> treads <HI>firm</HI> by Reason of <HI>this,</HI> while it draws the <HI>Plough</HI> or Cart; the swift <HI>Race-Horse</HI> treads strong and <HI>sure</HI> as he seems to <HI>fly</HI> thro' the Air: The <HI>Deer, Hare</HI> and <HI>Hound</HI> alike owe their <HI>Speed</HI> to this; and so do the <HI>Birds on their Wing,</HI> even all the <HI>Fowl of Heaven;</HI> and none more than the strong <HI>Hawk</HI> and the <HI>Eagle.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. In this <HI>Firmament of God's Power</HI> the <HI>Vapours and Clouds</HI> have their Motions; the <HI>Dews</HI> also and the <HI>Rains; "The small and great Rains of GOD's Strength";</HI> his Treasures of <HI>Snow</HI> and <HI>Hail,</HI> his <HI>Lightnings</HI> and <HI>Thunders;</HI> his Tempest and <HI>Whirlwind</HI> which <HI>takes us as Stubble;</HI> the <HI>LORD has his Way in it.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Thunder of his Power</HI> who can understand? And who is not at Times struck into a <HI>sacred</HI> Astonishment at it? When the <HI>Fire</HI> of his <HI>Lightning</HI> sometimes strikes and <HI>melts a Cannon</HI> in a Moment of Time! At this (as <HI>Elihu</HI> speaks) <Q>Our <HI>Hearts</HI> may well <HI>tremble</HI> and be <HI>moved</HI> out of their Place!</Q> hear attentively the <HI>Noise</HI> <Q>of his Voice, and the <HI>Sound</HI> that goeth out of his Mouth! He directs it under the <HI>whole</HI> Heaven, and his Lightning to the <HI>Ends</HI> of the Earth! He thunders <HI>marvelously,</HI> with the Voice of his <HI>Excellency.</HI> Job xxxvii.</Q></P>
<P>Thus was the <HI>Power</HI> of GOD seen and felt in the <HI>Fire and Brimstone</HI> which he rained from Heaven on <HI>Sodom;</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="005155_0015_1016C96F9638C050"/>and so in the <HI>Fire and Hail</HI> that poured down and <HI>ran along the Ground</HI> in the Day of <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. Again, How terrible does the <HI>Firmament of</HI> GOD's <HI>Power</HI> appear to us in <HI>Storms at Sea,</HI> which <HI>toss up</HI> the Wa∣ters to the <HI>Sky!</HI> Or in Storms at <HI>Land,</HI> which <HI>blow down</HI> our Houses! As in the Day of the <HI>Sons and Daughters of Job,</HI> when met to rejoice together in the <HI>Bounties</HI> of their GOD. — How dreadful looks the <HI>Power</HI> of GOD in our <HI>Air</HI> in those <HI>Descriptions</HI> which He himself has given us of it! Psalm xviii. 8,—16. <Q>There went up a <HI>Smoke</HI> out of his Nostrils, and <HI>Fire</HI> out of his Mouth devoured; <HI>Coals</HI> were kindled — it! He <HI>bowed the Heavens</HI> also and came down and <HI>Darkness</HI> was under his Feet! He <HI>rode</HI> upon a <HI>Che∣rub</HI> and did <HI>fly,</HI> yea he flow upon the <HI>Wings of the Wind!</HI> He made <HI>Darkness</HI> his secret Place, his <HI>Pavilion</HI> round about him were <HI>dark Waters</HI> and thick Clouds of the Sky! At the Brightness that was before him his thick Clouds passed; <HI>Hail-Stones and Coals of Fire!</HI> Then the <HI>Chan∣nels of the Waters</HI> were seen, and the <HI>Foundations</HI> of the World were discovered! At thy <HI>Rebuke</HI> O LORD, at the <HI>Blast</HI> of the <HI>Breath</HI> of thy Nostrils! And Psalm xcvii. 4, 5, 6. His <HI>Lightnings</HI> enlighten the World, the Earth <HI>sees</HI> and trembles! the Hills <HI>melt</HI> like Wax at the Presence of the LORD! the <HI>Heavens</HI> declare his Righteousness, and all the People see his <HI>Glory!</HI></Q></P>
<P N="4">4. In this <HI>Firmament of Power</HI> there are <HI>other Fires,</HI> which GOD kindles and <HI>consumes</HI> us by: <HI>pestilential Vapours</HI> float in our Air, which we breathe <HI>in,</HI> and they kindle <HI>Flames with∣in us,</HI> which <HI>burn</HI> us to Death: — <HI>Drought, Blasting and Mildew</HI> also come from too much <HI>Heat or Cold,</HI> Dryness or Moisture in the <HI>Air,</HI> to <HI>famish</HI> us and the Creatures about us, as it pleases GOD to order it: These are the <HI>Power</HI> of GOD in <HI>judging</HI> a People for their Sins.</P>
<P N="5">5.

<P N="3">III. How GOD is to be PRAISED BY US in and for this his <HI>Power</HI> and Glory in the <HI>Firmament.</HI></P>
<P>And if it were not <HI>such</HI> as it is, and there were not such an <HI>Excellency of Power</HI> in it; we could <HI>not move our Tongue,</HI> nor <HI>open a Lip</HI> to <HI>praise</HI> Him! We could not form the least <HI>Word</HI> we speak or <HI>Note</HI> we sing in his <HI>Sanctuary!</HI> It is because we have such an <HI>Air</HI> to breathe in, that we can <HI>lift our Voice on high,</HI> and make <HI>one Sound together,</HI> in the <HI>Praises of our GOD.</HI> — The <HI>Air</HI> is made for <HI>Sound;</HI> and to be sure therefore <HI>first</HI> of all to make the <HI>high</HI> PRAISES <HI>of GOD</HI> to be heard among us and from us.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Work</HI> it self praises GOD; speaks his <HI>Eter∣nal Power and</HI> GODHEAD, and shows his <HI>excellent Great∣ness.</HI> Without it, none of the Works of GOD could be <HI>beheld</HI> by us; for it is made for a <HI>Medium of Vision,</HI> for the Passage of Light to our Eyes; and so <HI>Day</HI> after <HI>Day</HI> utters this <HI>Speech,</HI> calling on us to <Q><HI>awake up our Glory and not be silent.</HI> The <HI>Firmament sheweth his handy-Work,</HI></Q> (the <HI>daily Operations</HI> of his Hand) and <HI>new</HI> Matter of Praise <HI>breaks in</HI> upon us every <HI>Morning</HI> and passes before us every <HI>Moment.</HI> — We call in the Assistance of our <HI>Glasses,</HI> the wondrous <HI>Teliescope,</HI> and through mighty Distances espy <HI>new Worlds,</HI> which give us <HI>new Calls</HI> to adore and lift up our Voices in <HI>new</HI> Songs; Psal. cxlviii. 3, 4, 5. <HI>Praise ye Him Sun and Moon, praise him all ye Stars of Light! Praise Him ye Heaven of Heavens, and ye Waters that be above the Hea∣vers! For he commanded and they were created; he hath also established them for ever and ever, by a Decree which shall not pass.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>dumb Creatures</HI> praise GOD in their Manner, for the <HI>Firmament</HI> which they breathe and <HI>feed</HI> in. "The <HI>wild Ass snuffeth up the hind</HI> at large! Who has <HI>sent</HI>

<P>But leaving the <HI>wild Ass</HI> to range on, let us look at home, on the <HI>generous Horse</HI> at our Door. It is the <HI>Firmament</HI> of GOD's POWER that has <HI>given the</HI> <Q><HI>Horse his Strength, and clothed his Neck with Thunder: The Glory of his Nostrils is terrible!</HI> He <HI>paws</HI> in the Val∣ley, and <HI>mocks</HI> at Fear, nor turns <HI>back</HI> from the Sword: He <HI>swallows</HI> the Ground with Fierceness and Rage, <HI>smells</HI> the Battle afar off, and <HI>answers</HI> to the shouting and Thunder of the <HI>Captains.</HI></Q> Job. xxxix. 24, 25.</P>
<P>So the "<HI>Hawk</HI> flies by the Wisdom of GOD, who has prepared the <HI>Air</HI> for its <HI>strong Wings,</HI> which she <HI>stretcheth to the North and South;</HI> as if the whole <HI>Fir∣mament</HI> were her <HI>own.</HI> The <HI>Eagle</HI> also mounts up, and makes <HI>her Nest on high.</HI> GOD displays the <HI>Power of his Firmament</HI> in <HI>these Instances,</HI> ver. 26, 27. — And in the two next <HI>Chapters</HI> the LORD magnifies to <HI>Man,</HI> for his Abasement before Him, his <HI>Behemoth</HI> on the Land, and his <HI>Leviathan</HI> in the Sea; which are among the <HI>chief of his Ways;</HI> for the <HI>one</HI> trusts that he can <HI>drink up the Rivers,</HI> and the other <HI>spouts up the Seas</HI> against the Skies. — Nor is there a strong <HI>Beast</HI> on Land, or <HI>Fish</HI> in Water, that could <HI>stretch a Synew</HI> or a <HI>Fin,</HI> if the Ele∣ment of <HI>Air</HI> did not <HI>cleave</HI> around and <HI>compress</HI> our <HI>Terraqueous Globe.</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"The <HI>Compression</HI> of the <HI>Air,</HI> by its own Weight, is exceeding great▪ As 1. is to 13000 (says our <HI>new Philosophy</HI>) so is the common Air we breathe and move in <HI>compressed</HI> by the Weight of the super-in∣cumbent <HI>Atmosphere;</HI> which is computed to be 17 French <HI>Leagues</HI> in Height.</NOTE></P>

So has GOD <HI>spoken</HI> to Man once <HI>out of the Whirl∣wind,</HI> and demanded the <HI>Praises of his inferior Creatures;</HI> and he has it: Psalm cxlviii. 7, 8, 9. <HI>Praise the LORD from the Earth, ye Dragons and all Deeps, Mountains and all Hills, fruitful Trees and all Cedars, Beasts and all Cat∣tle, creeping Things and flying Fowl.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. But MAN, MAN — he is the <HI>Creature</HI> here be∣low, form'd for giving <HI>Praise</HI> to GOD.

His <HI>Hands</HI> also (says my <HI>Context</HI>) are made to praise <HI>upon the Psaltery and Harp, the stringed Instruments and Or∣gans:</HI> His <HI>Feet</HI> also in the <HI>Dance</HI> of old, as the <HI>King of Israel</HI> before the <HI>Ark of the LORD.</HI> — Man's <HI>Body</HI> is made to stand and bow, kneel and lie prostrate before the THRONE. We have Eyes and Hands and Voice to <HI>lift up,</HI> with our Hearts, unto GOD in the Heavens.— And for our Sakes, <HI>Angels</HI> too are represented as having <HI>Tongues and Voices,</HI> and have been heard <HI>giving Glory to GOD on High.</HI> They pass <HI>swiftly</HI> also from World to World when GOD sends them, as he did <HI>Gabriel</HI> down to <HI>Daniel.</HI> The <HI>Dream</HI> of <HI>Jacob</HI> was a true <HI>Vision,</HI> the <HI>Ladder</HI> which he saw from Earth to Heaven, and the <HI>Angels</HI> of GOD upon it, descending and ascending.

<P>After all the <HI>Revelation</HI> that GOD had made of HIM∣SELF unto <HI>Job</HI> and his pious <HI>Friends;</HI> after all the <HI>Work of</HI> GOD wrought <HI>in them,</HI> and their Life of Com∣munion with Him; yet at last he <HI>led them</HI> together into his <HI>Firmament,</HI> as the <HI>high School</HI> for their further Im∣provement. GOD spake to them out of the <HI>Whirlwind,</HI> concerning his POWER and sovereign Dominion, and they fell <HI>adoring</HI> in Silence and <HI>Self-abhorrence;</HI> <Q><HI>Now my Eye seeth THEE, wherefore I abhor my self, and repent in Dust and Ashes.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Your <HI>Bibles,</HI> my dear <HI>Hearers;</HI> and the SPIRIT OF GOD within you, you <HI>Children</HI> of the MOST HIGH; di∣rect and teach you to be daily reading through the vast
<PB N="17" REF="005155_0023_1016C98404435AB8"/><HI>Roll</HI> of Nature, <HI>written within and without,</HI> the Glories of the DIVINE MAJESTY.</P>
<P>Never think therefore that your <HI>Ministers wander</HI> from the WORD and SPIRIT of GOD in their preaching to you, nor from the <HI>Work of Grace</HI> within you, but are wisely <HI>serving</HI> it, while they show you the <HI>Praises</HI> of GOD, which his <HI>visible Works</HI> demand from you.</P>
<P>HE who spake on Earth, so as <HI>never Man did,</HI> spake also of HIMSELF and of the FATHER by the Pen of <HI>Solomon,</HI> to the Church of his <HI>First-Born</HI> in all Times to come, Prov. viii. 27. <Q><HI>When he prepared the Heavens I was there;</HI></Q> <HI>when he set a Compass on the Face of the Deep! When he established the Clouds above, and gave to the Sea his Decree.</HI></P>
<P>You see here, that the <HI>Firmament</HI> is the <HI>Book</HI> and <HI>School</HI> of JESUS CHRIST, and he sends us to it to learn respecting <HI>himself;</HI> and to <HI>Him,</HI> who is <HI>ascended above all Heavens,</HI> we must be looking thro' it.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> While GOD continues us in these animal dying <HI>Bodies,</HI> we must devoutly consider GOD's <HI>Firma∣ment</HI> as the great MEDIUM and Instrument of his con∣veying to <HI>our World</HI> (and to what <HI>other</HI> Worlds we know not, but have Reason to think the same re∣specting many others) his immense Benefits and <HI>Bounties</HI> of a <HI>temporal</HI> and earthly Kind, for the Preservation of our <HI>Lives,</HI> and for our daily and yearly <HI>Supplies</HI> with all the Necessaries and Comforts of them. For in vain had <HI>Land</HI> and <HI>Sea</HI> been made without a <HI>Firmament;</HI> for there could have been neither <HI>ploughing</HI> or <HI>sailing</HI> without it; nor Business, Food, Health, Strength and Pleasure; no <HI>Seed-time</HI> or <HI>Harvest,</HI> Day or Night, Summer or Winter; no Grass for the <HI>Cattle</HI> nor Herb for <HI>Man;</HI> no Smell or Taste or Appetite for Corn, Wine and Oil: in as much as the whole <HI>Sustenance</HI> of every <HI>sensitive</HI> Creature depends upon this <HI>potent</HI> and beneficent <HI>Firma∣ment;</HI> by which GOD <HI>holds</HI> our Soul in Life; by which also he <HI>judges the People:</HI> For (as has been said before) neither could there be sultry <HI>Heat</HI> or chilling <HI>Cold,</HI> stag∣nating <HI>Calms</HI> or furious <HI>Storms,</HI> Pestilence and Famine,
<PB N="18" REF="005155_0024_1016C98786EA7648"/>Whirlwinds or Earthquakes; no present <HI>Good</HI> or <HI>Evil</HI> come to us, without a <HI>Firmament</HI> surrounding us. Let <HI>Elihu</HI> first, and then <HI>David</HI> teach us how to <HI>adore</HI> and give Glory to GOD for this perpetual <HI>Profusion</HI> of Be∣neficence to so many Worlds besides ours. Job xxxvi. 24,—33. "<HI>Remember that thou magnify his Work which Men behold! Every Man may see it, Men may behold it afar off! Behold</HI> GOD <HI>is great and we know him not; neither can the Number of his Years be searched out! For he maketh small the Drops of Water, they pour down Rain according to the Vapour thereof; which the Clouds do drop and distill upon Man abundantly! Also who can understand the Spreadings of the Clouds, or the Noise of his Tabernacle? Behold he spreadeth his Light upon it, it covers</HI> (reaches down to) <HI>the Bottom of the Sea!</HI> By the Clouds also <HI>he judgeth the People,</HI> and by them <HI>he gives Meat in Abun∣dance;</HI> &amp;c. Psal. lxviii. ulz. "<HI>Sing unto GOD, ye Kingdoms of the Earth, O sing Praises to the LORD, Selah! To</HI> HIM <HI>that rideth upon the Heavens of Heavens which were of old! Lo he doth send forth his Voice, and that a mighty Voice! Ascribe ye</HI> STRENGTH <HI>unto GOD; his Excellency is over Israel, and his Strength is in the Clouds! O</HI> GOD, <HI>thou art terrible out of thy holy Places; the</HI> GOD <HI>of Israel is he who giveth Strength and Power to his People! blessed be GOD.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> Let what has been said of the <HI>visible Firma∣ment</HI> lead us into the Contemplation of GOD's <HI>spiritual Kingdom,</HI> both of <HI>Grace and Judgment, visible</HI> and <HI>in∣visible, present</HI> and <HI>future.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Word</HI> and SPIRIT of GOD will justify us in this <HI>Transition;</HI> For 1. The <HI>visible spiritual</HI> Kingdom of Grace, in the <HI>Church of</HI> GOD on Earth, is repre∣sented to us by a glorious <HI>Firmament of Power and Mercy.</HI> And 2. As to the <HI>invisible World,</HI> if <HI>Hell</HI> be <HI>without</HI> a Firmament, a Firmament of <HI>Glory</HI> will be found in <HI>Heaven.</HI></P>
<P><HI>First</HI> then, the visible Kingdom of <HI>Grace,</HI> in the <HI>Church</HI> of GOD on Earth, is represented to us by a glorious <HI>Fir∣mament of Power</HI> and Mercy. This has been in part shown before, but I have yet to add.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="005155_0025_1016C989616272A0"/>
CHRIST in his <HI>Person, Offices</HI> and <HI>Benefits</HI> is in the <HI>holy Scriptures</HI> declared to be <HI>the Light of the World, the Sun of Righteousness,</HI> arising over <HI>Souls</HI> with <HI>Healing</HI> under the <HI>Rays.</HI></P>
<P>Then if we go on to contemplate the <HI>Church of the Sanctified,</HI> she is represented by a <HI>Woman cloathed with the Sun,</HI> with the <HI>Moon and Stars under her Feet,</HI> and on her <HI>Head a Crown of twelve Stars.</HI> Revel. xii. 1.</P>
<P>And if we go on to consider <HI>them that minister to the Heirs of Salvation, Angels</HI> or <HI>Men;</HI> there is a <HI>Ladder</HI> for the <HI>one</HI> from Heaven to Earth, whereon they <HI>descend</HI> unto and <HI>return</HI> from the <HI>Sons of Men;</HI> or they have <HI>Wings</HI> to <HI>fly</HI> down swiftly: — And as for the <HI>other, Men</HI> whom GOD has <HI>set</HI> in his Church from the Begin∣ning, <HI>Patriarchs, Prophets, Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors</HI> and <HI>Teachers,</HI> — these are STARS <HI>in the right Hand of</HI> CHRIST: Revel. i.</P>
<P>Or if we go on to speak of the WORD they preach, it is as <HI>a Light that shineth in a dark Place:</HI> or if we speak of the <HI>Gifts and Graces of the</HI> SPIRIT in 'em, or exercis'd in their <HI>Ministry,</HI> these render 'em so many <HI>burning and shining Lights</HI> to and in the <HI>Churches</HI> to whom they minister: And finally, the <HI>Work of Grace</HI> begun and increasing in the Soul of every <HI>private Christian,</HI> and exhibited in their <HI>holy Life</HI> and Conversation, makes <HI>them</HI> LIGHT IN THE LORD; holding forth the Power and Efficacy of the <HI>Word of Life,</HI> and making them shine <HI>as Lights in the World;</HI> in <HI>Family</HI>-Order, in <HI>Church</HI>-Order, in <HI>Sabbath</HI>-Sanctification which belongs to both; and this "<HI>Path of the Just shines on unto the perfect Day.</HI></P>
<P>On these Accounts it is that the SPIRIT says unto the <HI>Churches, "Arise, shine, for thy Light is come, and the Glory of the</HI> LORD <HI>is risen upon thee! and the Na∣tions shall come to thy Light, and Kings to the Brightness of thy Rising.</HI> — And this is the <HI>Firmament of Glory</HI> in the <HI>visible Church on Earth;</HI> "wherein with <HI>open Face</HI> beholding as in a <HI>Glass</HI> the Glory of the LORD, <HI>Souls</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="005155_0026_1016C98CC466DC90"/>are <HI>changed</HI> from Glory to Glory by the SPIRIT OF THE LORD.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Let us now look into the <HI>future</HI> ETERNAL WORLD, and see what we find in <HI>Scripture,</HI> or in the <HI>Nature</HI> of the Things revealed, of a FIRMAMENT therein.</P>
<P>O what will <HI>Heaven</HI> and what <HI>Hell</HI> be hereafter, to <HI>saved</HI> or <HI>damned</HI> Souls! in what <HI>Aether of Light</HI> or <HI>Cavern</HI> of Smoke and <HI>Gloom</HI> shall <HI>we be,</HI> when we must breathe in this <HI>Air</HI> no longer! — As the contemplative, learn∣ed, philosophical Mr. NORRIS, a <HI>Master</HI> among us of the <HI>Ideal World,</HI> while with us here below,
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Norris</HI> his <HI>Miscellanies.</HI> p. 24. 3. Edit.</NOTE> sang to himself of <HI>dying</HI> and departing hence, —

<L>A dismal and <HI>mysterious</HI> Change,</L>
<L>When thou shalt leave this <HI>Tenement</HI> of Clay,</L>
<L>And to an <HI>unknown Somewhere</HI> wing away;</L>
