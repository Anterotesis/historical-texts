<P>The Second Part of the Mystry of Fox-Craft</P>
<P>Introduced with about Thirty Quotations truly taken from the <HI>Quakers</HI> Books, and well attested by Men learned and Pious; proving all, and more than all the Charges in F. <HI>Bugg's</HI> Bomb of half a Sheet, which Mr. <HI>Talbot</HI> reprinted and sent to the <HI>Quakers</HI> at their General Meeting at <HI>Burlington</HI> in 1704. where he appointed time and place for them to meet him, and promised in F. B<HI>'s</HI> stead to prove the said Charges against them in the face of the Country. But they finding their Cause would not bear that Test, refused to meet him; but have at last published a bulky Book of 14 Sheets, entituled, <HI>The Bomb-Searcher, &amp;c.</HI> therein denying themselves to be guilty, as by the <HI>Bomb</HI> charged.</P>
<P>But it is herein Proved,</P>

<P>WE need quote none but <HI>W.

<P>NEither have you [Priests] the Word of God in your hearts, nor Christ, which is Eternal and Infallible; all which the <HI>Quakers</HI> have to Judge Persons and things. <HI>Great Mistery,</HI> by G. F. pag. 5.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers</HI> have a spirit given beyond all the Fore-fathers since the days of the Apostles in the Apostacy, and they can discern who are Saints, who are Devils, and who Apostates without speaking ever a word, they that be in the power and life of truth. page 89.</P>
<P><HI>G.

And so ye Priests which do not discern the soul, and its state to Eternity, and from Eternity, ye are not in the Mistery of the Gospel, which gives liberty to it—And you five Priests have shamed your selves that do not know the soul from Eternity to Eternity. pag. 229.</P>

<P><HI>G.

<P><PB N="5" REF="001248_0005_0FB18B58DA5A5E50"/><HI>Note,</HI> I could bring three hundred Quotations, of these and such like Heresies, as their denying the <HI>Resurrection of the Body that dyes.</HI> Their denying, <HI>The future Judgment, The locality of Heaven and Hell,</HI> &amp;c. But my design is to be compendious and short, as more suiting this time of day, Mankind inclining rather to converse with the living than the dead; for long discourse<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Controvesy of this nature are become tedious, as I see by <HI>C. Pusseys</HI> books, which have therefore exchanged the Monthly Meeting for the Tobacco Shop.</P>
<P>Besides, The Author of the <HI>Snake,</HI> &amp;c. has effectually handled this Con∣troversie, and mortally wounded the ill shaped Brood of their monstrous Heresies, so that my doing any thing of this kind, would have been needless if the works of that worthy Author were as easie to come at in these parts; therefore I come briefly to the matter.</P>
<P>The <HI>Bomb searcher,</HI> pag. 9. Before he begins with the charges, he takes up the last thing in the bomb to answer first, which is a harmless word of Mr. <HI>Talbot's,</HI> who had called <HI>F. Bug, HONEST Francis.</HI> But this they cannot bear: What! call him Honest whom they say is a Devil Incarnate. This is unsufferable. Therefore <HI>C. P.</HI> musters up his forces to prove <HI>F. Bugg</HI> disho∣nest, the sum of which is this, That whereas he the said <HI>F. B.</HI> having oblig∣ed himself to give his Daughter a Portion and his Wife a Joyn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ure, but finding himself in debt, could not perform his obligation to his Wife and Daughter, but honestly sold his Estate to pay his debts. Behold, what bad luck Friend <HI>Caleb</HI> has: Sure his Wits were in his Mill-hopper when he brought this to prove <HI>F. B.</HI> dishonest; for, this proves him to be of an honest mind. Nay, but hold, the <HI>Quakers</HI> know he is a very Devil, for he writes against them, and they have the spirit of discerning [as you see before] <HI>G. F.</HI> says, <HI>They can discern who are Devils, and who Saints without speaking a word.</HI> But have they not as bad luck here too? is not <HI>G. F.</HI> a deceiver in saying this? Yes, verily for <HI>Fox</HI> himself did not discern his intimate friend <HI>Ezekiel Woolley,</HI> at whose house he used to lodge in <HI>London,</HI> till it was told to <HI>George,</HI> that he the said <HI>Woolley</HI> had got his Neighbour, the Watch-makers Wife with child.</P>
<P>Next, comes a matter of weight and seriousness, <HI>S. Eccles</HI> had said, <HI>That the Blood of Christ was no more than the Blood of another Saint;</HI> and <HI>C A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kins</HI> said, <HI>They</HI> [the <HI>Quakers</HI>] <HI>deny our imagined God above the stars.</HI> As to the first of these, <HI>C. P.</HI> says, <HI>G. W. has disowned,</HI> and therefore calls it <HI>inveterate hatred in us to quote it again.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answ.</HI> This is a piece of <HI>Fox-Craft</HI> in <HI>C. P.</HI> yea, great deceit; For <HI>G. W.</HI> does not disown it, but contrary ways, makes an ungodly defence of it in his Book, <HI>Light and Life,</HI> pag. 58. [which page he entitules, <HI>The Blood of the New-Covenant spiritual</HI>] where he argues. <Q>That the blood outwardly shed by wicked hands, was not the Blood or Life of Christ; for (say he) it is not in being; and therefore renders him a dead Christ.</Q> Thus Blasphemously does he defend this very expression of <HI>S. Eccles,</HI> instead of disowning it▪
<PB N="6" REF="001248_0006_0FB18B5A371A8970"/>
I have this Book of <HI>G W.</HI> by me, to shew to all that doubt of the truth of it; in which Book <HI>G. W.</HI> indeed speaks highly of what they call their spiritual Blood of their Christ or Light within. But [as you see before] he rejects the human Blood of Christ. <HI>G. Fox</HI> says, Christ in the Male and Female is the seed, and the seed Christ — And the Blood of the seed cleanseth from sin, <HI>Gr. Mistery</HI> pag. 299, 281. And this seed <HI>W. P.</HI> denys to be the Person born of the Virgin, but says, 'tis a principle of Light in man [as you see before] so that 'tis this imagined inward Blood and not the human Blood, that <HI>C. P.</HI> also means; by which he deceives the unwary Reader: Therefore he ought to make publick satisfaction for offering both by a lye and Jesuitical meaning thus to betray the ignorant and simple hearted into this blasphemous notion of the Blood of Christ.</P>
<P>But, <HI>Secondly,</HI> As to <HI>C. A's</HI> denying the <HI>imagined God above the Sars,</HI> C. P. says, <HI>They have disowned both the passage and the Author.</HI> But this also is a piece of <HI>Fox-Craft;</HI> for they do not disown the same Doctrine, (as you see before) <HI>W. B.</HI> asserts the very same Doctrine, which the <HI>Quakers</HI> own and Justify. They did indeed disown the said <HI>Atkins</HI> after he was hanged for fellony, and I never heard they disowned him before; for they owned him after he had lain with <HI>Simons</HI> his Maid in <HI>Norwich</HI> Goal, because he confest the fact; for he continued a travelling Preacher afterwards. But this <HI>Bomb-Searcher</HI> would make his Reader believe that they disown'd <HI>Atkins</HI> because of that doctrine; which is deceit, and still confirms <HI>F. B's</HI> Charge, That the <HI>Quaker</HI>-Writers and Preachers make it their whole business to deceive.</P>
<P>Now, before we come to the Charges in the <HI>Bomb,</HI> I take notice, the <HI>Quakers</HI> in pag. 6. of the Preface, confess, That if we can prove those Charges, they own themselves neither fit for Religious nor Civil Societies. Tho' this be a meer vaunt, a sham, and they intend it for nothing else but Mockery; yet they are hereby manifestly Self-Judged and Self-Condemn'd; for they know that not only these, but many more as erronious Charges has been often proved upon them, so as that they never dare venture to refer the cause between them and their Adversaries to indifferent men.</P>
<P>He enters, pag. 14. upon the first charge of their Contempt of the holy Scriptures, which is fully proved in the Quotations, page 2, 3 for though I have not now the books by me that calls them Beastly Ware, an Idol, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet to call faith in the history of Christs Manifestation (<HI>viz.</HI> the New-Testa∣ment) a deadly Poison, as <HI>W P.</HI> does; This I take to be as great a contempt as can be put upon the Scriptures.</P>
<P>But here <HI>C P.</HI> to defend or excuse their Rage against the Scriptures, says That <HI>G. F.</HI> said that a Priest said, that the Letter of the Scripture is God. But I cannot think that the <HI>Quakers</HI> heartily believe that this is not a lye of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r <HI>Fox.</HI> For they know full well, that there has been many Proofs brought (not only by others, but some by me) shewing that it was his constant practise to abuse and bely the Books and Sayings of his Opponents▪ And the <HI>Quakers</HI> in their Answers to those proofs, have not yet offered to disprove one of them, and yet they will insist upon this, which tho' it looks like a
<PB N="7" REF="001248_0007_0FB18B5BB6269450"/>
lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Lye, yet they know we cannot disprove it, because <HI>Fox</HI> quotes no mans Book for it.</P>
<P>But suppose that some mad man or other had said the letter of the Scrip∣ture is God, does this justify <HI>Fox</HI> in calling them Serpents Meat, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and yet call his own Writings The Word of God? Friend <HI>Caleb</HI> seems here to be got into a vein of Jesting or Comical dissemulation; for he would have it, that 'tis only the Ink and Paper, the Letter that they quarrel at, as if their own Books were not made of Paper and Letter as well as the Bible. But <HI>Fox</HI> says, <HI>Feeding upon the Letter, which is Death, which feeds you Serpents, Dogs and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</HI> Now they know that no man eats the Ink and Paper, but 'tis the Doctrine they feed on; and therefore this stills shews their design is only to deceive. I have shewed in this years Almanack from matter of fact, that they still hold the same Opinion of the scriptures, even while with the next breath they will say, they believe them of divine Authority.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> Their blasphemous denyal of the holy Trinity is plain pag. 2, 3. whereby the <HI>Quakers</HI> excluded themselves from being Protestant Dissenters; They can have no benefit of the Act of toleration that denys the Trinity of three Persons in the God-head, as it is declared in the 39 Articles [which every true <HI>Quaker</HI> does deny] And this the last page of that Law expresly declares.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> That they deny <HI>Jesus</HI> to be Christ the Son of God, this is proud by almost every Quotation on that head at pag. 3. And yet this <HI>Bomb-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ercher</HI> has the impudence to say, this is an abominable, a notorious falshood and brings long quotations to prove the contrary. But here lies a Snake in the Grass, as I shall discover anon, and that there is need of large railing, to hide their vile Opinion on this point.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> Their neglect and contempt of the Ordinances is shewed but short in pag. 3. because their practice proves it without Quotations. But if they are not content with this, they may look in <HI>News out of the North,</HI> pag 4. where <HI>Fox</HI> calls Baptism and Christs Ordinance, the Sacrifice of <HI>Cain.</HI> And pag. 14. what the Apostles calls the Table and Cup of the Lord, 1. <HI>Cor.</HI> 10.21. <HI>Fox</HI> calls, The Table of Devils, and Cup of Devils.</P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> That they undervalue the Sufferings of Christ, by affirming, their own Sufferings to be greater and more unjust. This is plainly said at pag. 3 and is not denyed, but excused by this <HI>Bomb-S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>earcher.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Sixth</HI> Charge being proved in the first, I'll say no more of it, seeing he is silent in it.</P>
<P>Thus these Charges in the <HI>Bomb</HI> are breifly, yet fully proved by the Quota∣tions before, Notwithstanding the great noisy long Preachments and railing in the <HI>Bomb-Searcher</HI> to drive his Reader from the Scent o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> those vile Errors. But there is need of it for that purpose.</P>
<P>I shall now for confirmation, enlarge a little upon their denyal of Christ, and their Arts to hide their monstrous Notion of him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Quakers</HI> having rejected the outward Christ and his Blood, as having no faith therein, but only in what they call thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ or Light within <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="8" REF="001248_0008_0FB283C5E87A8898"/>place Salvation there, and in the Blood of this Light within, as is before shewed; which coming to be publickly noted, lookt so odious and Antichri∣stian, that they, (to avoid the odium) have Jumpt into tricks and arts of the antient Hereticks, to deceive by double meanings, <HI>viz.</HI> to make seeming Christian Confessions, but mean not a word of it, as <HI>Christians</HI> mean. They own a Personal Christ, and a man Christ without them, but mean it only of what they call the Light within all men, which they say it without them also of <HI>T. Ellwood</HI> in pag. 97. of his answer to <HI>G. Keiths Nar.</HI> is as plain in this as any of them. Christ was truly man (says he) before he appeared in the outward Body, and that not only in his People, but out of or without them also; How long before? Even from the beginning (says he) so <HI>W. P.</HI> denys that Person born of a Virgin to be the seed promised, <HI>Gen.</HI> 3. But says, 'tis a principle of Light in the heart, (as you see before.) Thus the <HI>Quakers</HI> Christ was a Man not only before he was made of a Woman, but even before any woman in the world was made. This is new doctrine, and is their foundation Error, whereon they build all the rest, and whoever will take the pains to read <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s <HI>Great Mistery,</HI> pag. 246, 249, 205, 211. will there see that nothing will serve him but for the Light within to be whole Christ, God and Man, Flesh, Body, Blood and Bones, and denys that Christ has any Body that is absent from his People, and is now in the Presence of his Father in Heaven without them; where he also holds, That it was God the Father that was born of the Virgin, or took human Nature.</P>
<P>I have this <HI>Great Mystry</HI> by me, and would gladly shew it to all who doubt of the truth of these Things.</P>
<P>Now to discover the Snake aforesaid, you must note, the <HI>Quakers</HI> have many times been urged and provoked to let the world know whether they believe in a Christ without them, now in haven, and whether they believe Christ is now and forever to come really a Man, in true and proper humane Nature without all other men? But they would never answer, Yea, to these Queries; but go round about 'em, and on every side, and seem to confess all, and much more, and yet mean nothing but to deceive. Thus this <HI>Bomb-Searcher,</HI> pag. 27. of the last part of his Book, to the first Query [<HI>Do you believe in a Christ without you,</HI> &amp;c?] says, if we mean that Christ is in heaven without us, as to his outward personal persence, and in us by his spiritual appearance, it is their faith, as well as ours.</P>
<P>Now observe, the deceit of these sincere <HI>Quakers.</HI> The Query is not whe∣ther they believe Christ is in heaven without them (tho' even this they do not believe, but in their meaning aforesaid) But the Query is, Do you believe IN a Christ without you, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI> believe to be saved by a Christ without you) This was the Query, and here it is that he deceives his unwary Reader, by hiding his head in a ho<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, like a Woodcock, and thinks no body sees him; he might have spared his long preachments of Quotations (full of such deceit as this) that he there brings from their Books to prove that they can say, Yea to those Queries, as well as we; for only these three simple Letters
<PB N="9" REF="001248_0009_0FB18B5D264706C8"/><HI>YEA,</HI> honestly exprest, would have done it, without all this. O but then they are sensible it would have given the lye to their former Doctrine before quoted, which they say, is their faith still, <HI>viz.</HI> That faith in Christ without m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n is contrary to the Apostles doctrine. And that the outward Christ is not the proper Son of God. And That Christ without is the false Christ. And that they are Reprobates that say they are saved by Christ without them. And much more to the same tune, which they must disown if ever they come to own Christianity.</P>
<P>But in short; their Disobedience to the Commands and Ordinances of the outward Christ is sufficient, without Quotations to prove that they deny him. For they cannot shew wherein they obey so much as one com∣mand of Christ, any more then the <HI>Jews</HI> do, who also deny him.</P>
<P>Nay, I could shew wherein the <HI>Jews</HI> own more of Christ then the <HI>Quakers</HI> own; for the <HI>Quakers</HI> would make nothing of Christ but moral virtues. <HI>What is Christ</HI> (says <HI>W Penn</HI>) <HI>but Meekness, Justice, Mercy, Patience,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Address to Protestants,</HI> pag. 119. where also he declares moral men to be Christians; and you see before, he calls it a deadly Poison to make any distinction between Christian and Moral. Thus the <HI>Quakers</HI> are forced upon this shift to allow moral heathens, <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Jews</HI> to be <HI>Chaistians,</HI> because they have no other way in the world to prove themselves Christians; there is only this difference, the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Infidels</HI> are the better, as being more free from deceit, because they make no pretence to Christianity, and the <HI>Quakers</HI> do.</P>
<P>But how strange is their delusion, who cannot see that at this rate there was no need at all of the holy Apostles being sent to the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Heathens</HI> to preach the Gospel of Peace and Salvation by Christ crucifyed. Nor indeed could there be any need of Christs coming, and being crucifyed. But the <HI>Quakers</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ainly say as much, for their Books tell us, that his coming in the flesh, and being crucifyed was but a figure, and for our example, as I have formerly shewed.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Why will this <HI>Bomb-Searcher</HI> so dissemble, as to imitate the Chri∣stian in owning (as before) that Chri∣st is personally without us, and in us by his spiritual influence, seeing in their Books they call it nonsense? Christ or the Spirit in his people, the beams of Christ without us, is nonsense, so <HI>G. Whitehead, Light and Life,</HI> pag. 26. I say, why will he thus make it his business to deceive in every thing?</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="appendix">
<HEAD><HI>An Appendix,</HI> with some Gleanings.</HEAD>
<P>I Shall in the first place insert a large Quotation from <HI>W. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Sandy Foundation</HI> (before Quoted, for their denyal of the Trinity) being a pretious Book with the <HI>Quakers,</HI> which was wrote against the Trinity, and Christs satisfaction, which Book they now keep up in <HI>England,</HI> for fear of
<PB N="10" REF="001248_0010_0FB18B5EAAEA5018"/>the Law and outward Powers; But here, having the power in their own hands, they are bold with it; and as if they would bid defiance to the Law, as well as to Christianity, they direct (pag. 76) where 'tis publickly to be seen at <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> and recommend it to be read by sober persons; wherefore to shew further of the arts used by these <HI>Quakers,</HI> for the distruc∣tion of <HI>Christianity,</HI> I also recommend to every considerate Reader what here followes, truly quoted out of that Book.</P>
<P><HI>Sandy Foundation,</HI> pag. 16, 20, 21, 22 He begins, pag. 16. thus; <Q>The vulgar Doctrine of Satisfaction, dependent on the second person of the imagined Trinity, Refuted, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> Then he goes on some pages to refute it, and brings his reasons to prove that Jesus Christ did not make satisfaction to God for our sins. And in pag. 20. he calls this following an Absurdity, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <Q>That the Finite and Impotent Creature is more capable of extending mercy &amp; forgiveness than the Infinite &amp; Omnipotent Creator — For admit∣ting God to be a Creditor (says he) or he to whom the Debt should be paid, and Christ he that pays it on the behalf of man, the Debtor, the Question will arise, Whether he paid the debt, as God, or Man, or both?</Q></P>
<P><HI>Not as God,</HI> (says he.)</P>
<P N="2">II. <Q>Because if Christ pays the debt as God, then, the Father and Spirit being God, they also pay the debt.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Not as man</HI> (says he.)</P>
<P N="3">III. <Q>The Justice offending being infinite, his satisfaction ought to bear a proportion therewith, which Jesus Christ, as Man, could never pay, he being FINITE, and from a finite cause, could not proceed an infinite effect; for so man may be said to bring forth God.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Not as God and Man.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <Q>For where two Mediums or Middle Propositions are singly inconstent with the nature of the end for which they were at first propounded, their Conjunction does rather augment, than lessen the difficulty of its accom∣plishment.</Q></P>
<P N="5">V. <Q>But Admitting one of these three Mediums possible for the payment of an infinite debt, yet pray observe, the most unworthy and ridiculous consequences that will attend the impossibility of Gods pa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>doning sinners without a satisfaction.</Q></P>
<P N="6">VI. <Q>Since Christ could not pay what was not his own [debt] it follows, that in the payment of his own, the case still remains equally greivous, since the debt is not hereby absolved or forgiven, but transferred only, and by consequence we are no better provided for salvation then before, owing that now to the Son which was once owing to the Father.</Q> Thus <HI>William Penn,</HI> with much more to the same purpose.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="001248_0011_0FB18B61620BA708"/>Now I desire to observe three things from the Quotation <HI>First,</HI> We see he denys that Christ either did or could pay our Debt, or make satisfaction to God for mans sin; which is horrible to think on; Yea, he argues expresly against any sort of Satisfaction made by Christ for our sins, as a thing Ridi∣culous and Non-sence, as every reader may see.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> In pag. 62. I find this <HI>Bomb-Searcher</HI> puffing out a bag of wind at me (as his term is) for adding the word [<HI>Debt</HI>] to <HI>W. P</HI>'s last Paragraph between the Crotchets. But it being nine years since I wrote that Book, he mentions, I know not whether I added the word or took it so from another impression, of <HI>W. P's</HI> however, now I own I have added it, and here offer to stand or fall by the Judgment of all good <HI>Christians,</HI> whether I have done ill therein, or not; yea, let any <HI>Quaker</HI> shew, if he can, wherein it alters the sence of the passage. I say, it does not: 'tis as blasphemous without it, as with it; So all to whom I have shewed it, say that <HI>W. Ps</HI> words bear the same sense either with or without that word [<HI>Debt</HI>] 'Tis only more plain with the wore <HI>Debt,</HI> to mean capacities. For 'tis nothing else but the <HI>Debt</HI> of our sins that <HI>W. P.</HI> there treats on. And Christ did pay a <HI>Debt</HI> that was not his own, but ours, otherwise we had perished eternally: This is <HI>Christi∣anity,</HI> contrary to <HI>W.Ps.</HI> Anti-christian Notion, <HI>That Christ could not pay what was not his own.</HI> And I would desire the <HI>Quakers</HI> to tell in their next print, What it was that Christ was to pay, or did pay, of his own, as <HI>W. P.</HI> there words it (seeing he denys that he paid any thing for us) and why they were so civil as not to say a word to that other agreeable passage which I quoted from <HI>R. Huberthorns</HI> works, pag. 20. where he affirms, <HI>Christ was capable of Repen∣tance.</HI> This they thought was easiest answered by silence. But pray tell us, what had Christ to repent of, or what did Christ owe to God of his own? And whether these sayings do not smell too rank of blasphemy with good <HI>Christians,</HI> though by deceitful Arts you may hide it from your Followers:</P>
<P>But tho' <HI>C. P.</HI> spends several pages to Banter me for adding this word [<HI>Debt</HI>] yet within 4 pages he himself is guilty of the same thing, <HI>viz.</HI> of adding words to a passage of <HI>W. Ps</HI> and that to alter the sence too, as I shall shew next page hereafter.</P>
<P><HI>Thir<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> Observe, that I have several times printed that <HI>W. P.</HI> in his <HI>Sandy Foundation</HI> terms Christ, as Man, <HI>A FINITE IMPOTENT CREATURE;</HI> But <HI>C. Pusey</HI> in his Book, <HI>Satans Ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>binger,</HI> pag. 31. boldly denysit, in these words, <HI>I do affi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>m there is no such saying or Irreverent Expression in the whole Book<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> W. P's, No, neither Expresly nor Implicity, nor so much as Consequentially. Note,</HI> These are his words; therefore I intreat the Reader to look back to page 10. where Finite Impotent Creature is expresly and in pag. 10. line 25 he affirms the same implicitly and consequentially, and in part expresly too, in these words, <HI>Which JESƲS CHRIST as Man, could never pay, he BEING FINITE. Note,</HI> here he implies that Christ was too weak, too Impotent to make infinite satisfaction, he being Finite; And a man that is Finite, is consequentially a Creature. Now since it appears that <HI>W. P.</HI> does say it <HI>Implicitly</HI> and <HI>Consequentially</HI> and [at least] in part <HI>Expresly too;</HI> and yet <HI>C. P.</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="001248_0012_0FB18B636C27C5A0"/>
denys it to be said any of these three ways, he ought therefore to make Publick satisfaction for this wretched Abuse, this double falshood, especially seeing I have more then once in print offered to make this very Passage as the touch stone of Tryal between his writings and mine, that if 4 or 6 indifferent men Judge it to be as he says, I would burn my Books, or what else those men should assign me to do. But if they found it as I say, he should do the like. This, I say, I have offered, but could never bring him to it. And yet is he so shameless, as still to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssert the same thing against me, and call on me for satisfaction for abusing <HI>W. Pen<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI></P>
<P>Now I come to pag. 66. where I find <HI>C. P.</HI> guilty of the same thing whereof he accuseth me but just before, <HI>viz.</HI> he adds a word to that Passage of <HI>W. P.</HI> before quoted in <HI>Quaker<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sm a New Nick,</HI> pag. 6. for he makes it run thus, <HI>Faith in the History of Christs outward Manifestation</HI> [Christianity] <HI>has been a deadly poison, &amp;c.</HI> The word [<HI>Christianity</HI>] he adds, and says it should be so by the Table of Errata, which made me look into that Table, but there is no such direction there, as all may see, who have that book: there∣fore this is falshood and deceit, such as his Friend <HI>G. Whitehead</HI> seems to be ashamed to act; for I look upon <HI>G W.</HI> to have twice the wit of <HI>C P.</HI> for deceit, yet he in his Book, <HI>Truth and Innocency,</HI> pag. 54. vindicates this Passage of <HI>W. P.</HI> as it is, without adding the word [<HI>Christanity</HI>] he was more honest then this <HI>Bomb-Searcher,</HI> for he found no need of it. But <HI>C. P.</HI> goes on till he also thrusts in the word [<HI>only</HI>] and now 'tis prety handsomly drest, and runs thus, <HI>Making faith</HI> [only] <HI>in the history of Christ</HI> [Christanity] <HI>has been a deadly poison.</HI> And now, forsooth, <HI>W. P.</HI> and St. <HI>Paul</HI> are fit company, and both of a mind. W. P. <HI>is not without good Company</HI> (says he) <HI>for he has</HI> Paul <HI>on his side.</HI> And to prove that St. <HI>Paul</HI> says the same with <HI>W. P.</HI> he quotes <HI>Rom.</HI> 1 8. and 8.13. Your faith hath been spoken of throughout the world; If ye live after the flesh ye shall dye; but if ye mortify the deeds of the body by the Spirit, ye shall live. Behold! are not his Wits got again into his Mill-Hop∣per? for are these words of St.<HI>Paul</HI> any thing like that doctrine of <HI>W P?</HI> O miserable shift! to defend their vile stuff, rather then confess and repent!</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> he calls on me for satisfaction, because the word [<HI>Debt</HI>] was added, as aforesaid, though between Crotchets, only to make the passage more intelligible to mean readers. But let him give satisfaction for adding those words on purpose to alter <HI>W. P</HI>'s sence, tho' he has mist of his purpose; for let him take it as he has mended it, yet the making faith [<HI>only</HI>] in the history of Christ [<HI>Christanity</HI>] cannot be a deadly poison; I am sure no true <HI>Christian</HI> dare say it.</P>
<P>But this <HI>Bomb-Searcher</HI> is Jack on both sides, for as here he adds words, so I find (in pag. 8. of the last part of his book) he takes words out of a passage of <HI>G. Fox,</HI> where G. F. says, <HI>He that hath the same Spirit that raised Jesus from the dead, is equal with God.</HI> Now Friend <HI>Caleb</HI> is for leaving out the words [<HI>he that hath</HI>] so then it runs thus, <HI>The same spirit that raised Jesus, is equal
<PB N="13" REF="001248_0013_0FB18B64C4274738"/>
with God,</HI> which is all one as to say, God is equal to God. This he makes to the size of <HI>G. F's</HI> Divinity, <HI>viz.</HI> to teach the Christan World, that God was equal to God.</P>
<P>Well, seeing <HI>C. P.</HI> has so good a hand at mincing and mending blasphemy, there is just such another piece of work for him to mend of the same <HI>G. F</HI>'s 'tis in the last quotation. page 4. upon that Text, <HI>Be ye perfect, as your hea∣venly Father is. And</HI> [says <HI>Fox</HI>] <HI>as he is, so are WE, and that which is perfect as he is perfect, is in Equality,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Now 'tis but taking off the first six words [<HI>as he is, so are we</HI>] and then it will run thus [That which is perfect as he is, is in Equality,] <HI>&amp;c.</HI> And so 'tis as cleaverly mended as that before, and is just as good sense. Or if he be disposed to make his Reader merry by mending it any other way, we will not only hear him, but also help him to more such Jobs of work, which by that time he has finished, we hope to see the <HI>Quakers</HI> proud imagination of a sinless perfection and Equality with God to tumble down a pace</P>
<P>In pag 72. I find he is still washing the Blackemore white, <HI>viz</HI> he would clear the <HI>Quakers</HI> from that vile Contempt of the holy Bible, in a Passage brought against it by <HI>Jos. Coal, viz.</HI> <Q>How deplorable a thing is it (says he) to see such hypocritical intruders (<HI>viz.</HI> Protestant Ministers) stand in a Pulpet with such a brazen faced Book as is their unjust corrupt and per∣verse Bible in their hands.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> here <HI>J. C.</HI> in the first place (and then the other <HI>Quakers</HI> who again reprinted it since <HI>J C's</HI> death) joyns with the most prophane Papist thus to blaspheme our Bible. For in page 40. <HI>Coal</HI> declares positive, That it does not concern him to answer it. No, he brings it as an Arrow from the Papists Quiver, and shoots it at the Bible, and then leaves it to the Protestants to think what they please of it. And yet they would seem now to be ashamed of it, but will not blame their Prophet <HI>J. C.</HI> and the other <HI>Quakers</HI> for several times Printing it against our Ministers and the Bible, which still shews they only design to deceive.</P>
<P>I Now come to the last part of his Book, being his Reply to the <HI>Mystery of Fox-Craft,</HI> and find in page 6. that he says, <HI>G. Fox</HI> did not assume to himself the compiling of that Book called, <HI>The Battledoor</HI> of the interpretation of about thirty Languages, but that it was <HI>J. Stubs</HI> and <HI>B. Furley</HI> that put <HI>G. Fox</HI>'s Name to the several pages of that Book.</P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> this still confirms &amp; discovers it to be a Cheat put upon the World; for else why should another man put his Name to what he is not the Author of, nor does not understand? Thus it comes out by little and little; for it being found out that <HI>Fox</HI> had not the gift of Tongues, as the poor <HI>Quakers</HI> to my certain knowledge (I for one) were made to believe; he is therefore forced to this half confession, that tho' <HI>Fox</HI> did it not, yet that it was done however by the Quakers, <HI>i. e. Stubs</HI> and <HI>Furley.</HI> But this is also a cheat or lye, for they hired a <HI>Jew</HI> to do the greatest part of it, or procure it to be done, and gave him eighty Pounds in Money for his pains, and there was also
<PB N="14" REF="001248_0014_0FB18B66336AEB08"/>
twelve bottles of Wine given over and above to make the <HI>Jew</HI> and his associates drink. And here the <HI>Fox</HI> is found out in his silly craft in preach∣ing down the Wisdom and Learning of the world, and yet deceitfully made use of it to raise his own fame.</P>
<P>In page 14. he finds a real fault in my Book the date of the year of the dispute of <HI>G. F</HI> is printed 1699 instead of 1659. so in my this years Alma∣nack <HI>John Benn<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t</HI> is printed for <HI>John H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lliard,</HI> which are escapes of the Press, and <HI>C. P's.</HI> Books are incident thereto as well as mine.</P>
<P><Q>In the same page he brings on the Oath of Abjuration, by which the <HI>Quakers</HI> of the Council and Assembly of <HI>New-Jersey</HI> engaged to Lord <HI>Cornbury</HI> to defend the Queen and her Successors to the utmost of their power against all their Enemies, and that as <HI>defend</HI> is commonly understood too; and yet, at the same time declared they could neither fight nor pay towards it, <HI>i. e.</HI> neither do it in P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rson nor Estate.</Q></P>
<P>Now I desired him to tell me how the <HI>Quakers</HI> could do this, and promised him a reward if he could tell me; But I find it has driven him into a Net. He says, page 15. he is no way obliged to tell me how. No, he is not obliged; Why? because he nor all the <HI>Quakers</HI> in the world have not art enough to do it. And thus they are confounded, being self condemned.</P>
<P>And whereas I had shewed how binding and positive the Act of Abjuration was made, and the <HI>Quakers</HI> had made a Proviso to make it all void, therefore he argues that they (the <HI>Quakers</HI>) do in that no more then is common for Kings and Parliments, to do [No, they have done no more] For he says, Kings, Paliaments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> often in their Laws, after positive commandings, make perticular Proviso's for mitigating, <HI>&amp;c. Note,</HI> Here they must set themselves up tantamount with Kings and Parliaments, and because the Queen and Parliament had made no Proviso in that Law, therefore the <HI>Quakers</HI> may do it. Why? because 'tis common for Kings, &amp;c. to do it. This shews the height of the sphere wherein these Saints imagine themselves to move, even to be Controulers of the Laws of Kings and Parliaments, at least here they wou'd be, and this they have declared to be their Right and Heirship, as I have else where shewed.</P>
<P>His insinuating, That I have broke my Oath, as a Councillor, in publish∣ing it, and that the Governour is concern'd to take notice of me. That is, my printing how the <HI>Quakers</HI> had taken this Abjuration Oath, which was done in the face of Country and Coffee-House News the same week, he would have to be a breaking my Oath as a Councillor. This only bewrayes the persecuting spirit; it will shew its grining Teeth sometimes. I pray God keep them from having power to bite me as they did poor <HI>Banks,</HI> one of their Opposers, who they catcht carrying his goods on horses through <HI>Pensilvania,</HI> and cast him into <HI>Philadelphia</HI> Prison, and took his Goods from him, even his whole estate.</P>
<P>Next, comes on their Reply to what I asserted, how some <HI>Quakers</HI> near <HI>Burlington</HI> took up arms on a report that a party of <HI>French</HI> were near. And they bring long certificates &amp; denying the matter, as if they were
<PB N="15" REF="001248_0015_0FB18B67A1B2E460"/>
mumbling of thistles. And tho' they quibble, and are in some things Comical, intimating that their Guns and other Weapons that they carried were only to scare folk, and to hurt no body, and that they fight only with spiritual Weapons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> yet because they deny not the thing in substance, as charged, and having spoke to it in my Almanack, I therefore dismiss this head, with only giving a quotation from the great <HI>Fox</HI> himself, shewing what they in∣tended against worldly Powers, when time serves, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>Sound the Trumpet, Sound an Alram, call up to the Battle, gather toge∣ther for destruction, draw the Sword, hew down all fruitless Trees that cumber the ground, hew down all false Justice, which is not Justice; hew down all the Powers of the earth, cleanse the land from all filthiness; purge from the dross, the filth and corruption; slay <HI>Baal, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aalam</HI> must be slain, and all the Hirlings turned out of the Kingdom, who have pretended that God sent them; the Sword of the Lord is drawn against you all, Wo and Misery to all ye Preists, ye blind Priests. See <HI>News out of the North,</HI> page 31. 32. 1654.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> Some may say, here is bloody work, had it gone on, and <HI>Oliver</HI> turned <HI>Quaker.</HI> But let us not mistake, did they not mean all this to be Spiritual, and Spiritual Weapons?</P>
<P><HI>I Answer;</HI> No; for in page 19. the Interpretation is plain <Q>So you must be cut down (says <HI>Fox</HI>) with the same Power that cut down the King (meaning <HI>K. Charls</HI> 1.) who reigned over the Nations, whose Family was a nursery for Papists and Bishops, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> Therefore I hope they will not say the Executioner was all Spirit, he had also flesh and bones; nor that the Block was a Spirit, nor the Ax a Spirit.</P>
<P>Next, as to <HI>Magistracy,</HI> which they ever accounted a cumbersom Tree, and therefore hear what they intend against it, pag. 20.</P>
<P><Q>Sing all ye Saints (<HI>viz. Quakers;</HI> for none else will have cause to sing) Clap your hands and be glad, for the Lord Jehovah will reign; And the Government shall be taken from you pretended Rulers, Judges, Justices, Lawyers and Constables; all this Tree must be cut down, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> If you ask, By what power? The answer is ready, pag. 19. <Q>So you must be cut down by the same Power that cut down the King, who reigned over the Nation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q></P>
<P><HI>Note,</HI> This may be compared with what I have (in print) formerly shewed how that their cheif Prophets have asserted the Right and Heirship of the <HI>Quakers</HI> to all the Kingdoms and Dominions under the whole Heavens, and that their King (the <HI>Light within</HI>) may Command them to fight for it, though, they say, they believe he will not yet make use of them in that way, not for the present.</P>
<P>In pag. 21. he begins to muster up a troop of falshoods against me, every one of which returns upon his own head. As for instance; I had said, pag. 5. of <HI>Mistery of Fox-Craft,</HI> That we see by <HI>G Fox's</HI> first Letter, he could not write the date of the year. Now this <HI>C. P.</HI> says is false. But I will let the Reader see 'tis true; for that which <HI>Fox</HI> writes for the date of
<PB N="16" REF="001248_0016_0FB18B691F5E5D70"/>
the year is thi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 16<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>9. Here let all men judge whether it does not appear by this that <HI>Fox</HI> did not know how to write the date of the year. Now when this <HI>Bomb-Searcher</HI> has made me Satisfaction for this abuse, I will shew him wherein he is as false in every one of the rest; for to what edification can it be to make Replyes to such a profuse Scribler, to such inconsiderable Lyes? But this is his method throughout, as if he were possest with the Spirit of <HI>Baal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> two lying Prophets.</P>
<P>I had told him how he copyed after the <HI>London Quakers,</HI> in his answers to me; Therefore that he may make a Book of something, he writes several pages to shew that I have also copyed after the Author of the <HI>Snake, G. K. &amp;c.</HI> Alas for him! have I not told him, that I cannot do better than to follow the example of good men. But for a <HI>Quaker</HI> to copy after other men is <HI>Conjuration,</HI> by their own doctrine; for <HI>G. F</HI> in <HI>Saul<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Errand,</HI> pag. 7. says, <HI>What is not spoken from the mouth of God, is Conjuration.</HI> Therefore if he had no where copyed after others (as I would shew he has, if it would edify) yet he is still as much a Conjurer, if all he has written be not immediately from the mouth of God; and that it is not, I have sufficiently shewed, unless from the mouth of the God of lyes. And thus this Conjurer imploys his time to set up a man of straw, that he may have something to fight against</P>
<P>In the Margent of the <HI>Mistry of Fox-Craft,</HI> pag. 4 there is a touch of the uncleanness of their Preachers; therefore to be even with us, he tell me, pag. 21. that if it was their way, they could also calumniate some Clergy∣men among us for Miscarriages (and then instances <HI>Rode-Island</HI> Minister) But thanks his God, that has taught them otherways. Behold, the deceipt, the confusion of this; for here even with the same breath he throws a secret calumny on <HI>Rode-Island</HI> Minister, and yet says, 'tis not their way, their God has taught them otherways. This shews what sort of a God it is that has taught them, even the God of lyes</P>
<P>But by the way, let me tell these <HI>Quakers,</HI> That the Clergy and <HI>Quaker</HI>-Preachers are under different Circumstances: The Clergy know themselves (and ALL men) to be frail sinners, often drawn by Temptations into sin, and therefore find a continual need of praying to God for Pardon, upon Repentance. But this the <HI>Quaker</HI>-Preachers disclaim, they are two proud. <HI>W. Penn</HI> mocks at our Liturgy for having a confession of sin in it. And you see before that <HI>G. F.</HI> calls it the doctrine of Devils to acknowledge a being in a warfare while we be on earth; Nay, he declares, That they (the <HI>Quakers</HI>) are Perfect in Equality with God (as you see before) This is a desperate and deplorable state for poor mortals to be possest with: 'Tis the height of Lu∣cifers Pride. Therefore 'tis upon this account, that we sometimes expose their failings, to shew them their sins; for there is no other way to humble them. But if they would come down upon the level with other mortals, to own themselves sinners, 1 <HI>John</HI> 1.8, 9. and pray for pardon; I should then think it a great evil to expose the private failings of any of them.</P>
<P>But as to his thanking God that has taught them otherways than to

calumniate people, or publish their Miscarriages; here he further shews himself to be wretchedly false, and that in the very next page before, where he casts a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se and lying calumny on our <HI>Burlington</HI> Magistrates, insinuating that they made men drunk to make them swear falsly. This way of the <HI>Quakers</HI> to wound Peoples Reputations, is inhumane and base, in that they do it secretly in the dark (where men have not the opportunity to defend themselves) and then to act the hypocrite in saying, God has taught them otherways</P>
<P><HI>La<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly,</HI> Whereas he banters me for writing ill of some who are long since dead and he hopes at rest with the Lord, But are not the <HI>Quakers</HI> guilty of this▪ Yes they have done it with a Vengeance, and without any cause too; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> I will give from W. P's <HI>Guide Mistaken,</HI> pag. 18. where he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eadfully sentences all the Clergy alive and dead for Ages past. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> (says he) <HI>have been s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> universally, through AGES, the very Ba<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>, as that abominable Tribe, for whom the Theatre of Gods most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> is reserved to Act their ETERNAL TRAGIDY upon — <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> for them but Woes and Plagues, who have made drunk the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> &amp;c.

<P>Thus after he has Damn'd all the Clergy, not only of the present Age, but through Ages past, and that universally too, in as dreadful words as can be uttered, he is sorry he cannot do it in words ten thousand times worse; for he declares they deserve it, even these Clergy-men who many Thousands of them were doubtless at rest with God long before W. P. or his <HI>Quake<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>is<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> was born into the world. And yet, these <HI>Quakers</HI> will make demure mouths at us, and tell us, 'tis not their way, their God has taught them otherways; yea, even thisself same W. P. in his <HI>Reas. against Rai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> pag. 163. declares, <HI>That he would not for more worlds, than there are stars in the firmament, so voilate the Laws of Charity, as to speak ill of the deceased; no, not their deceased Opposers.</HI> And thus they shew us what a lying God they are taught by.</P>
<P>Therefore I must now say to this <HI>Bomb-Searcher,</HI> C. P. as their own Pro∣phet <HI>E.

<P>Thus, to be measured by the Rule of one of their chief Prophets, they must not, they cannot deny, especially it being offered and referred to; by one, who, I am sure, is their well-wishing Friend,</P>

<HEAD>Postscript.</HEAD>
<P>THe learned <HI>Robert Barclay,</HI> whose Apology the <HI>Quakers</HI> have revised, amended and re-printed in great Numbers (and given of them to the Nobility, Gentry and Clergy of <HI>England,</HI> about eight or ten Thousand) as their Standard, instead of the Works of their FOX-Apostle, which I hear they have let fall, after they were upon the Stocks, as if they would (to save whole their Infallibility, silently slip by the grossest of their Blasphemy and Non-sence, and shape it up in a more artificial Trim, as the Proverb says, <HI>Older and Wiser.</HI></P>
<P>But yet, I must here let them know, that their learned <HI>Barclay</HI>'s Writings afford us sufficient Proof of the Impossibility of Reconci∣ling <HI>Quakerism</HI> to <HI>Christianity.</HI> The Author of the <HI>Snake, &amp;c.</HI> pag. 183, 185. of his second, <HI>Defence,</HI> gives us a notable Instance about his confounding <HI>Justification</HI> and <HI>Sanctification,</HI> making them both to be one, and performed within men; whereas <HI>Christianity</HI> makes them to be different things: <HI>Justification</HI> being wrought by Christ in his own Person, wholly without us, and but once performed; but <HI>Sanctification</HI> is the Work of Christ by his holy Spirit in our hearts, and daily to be renewed.</P>
<P>I shall here give you another Instance from the said <HI>R. B</HI>'s Works, and wou'd have the <HI>Quakers</HI> try their Wits to see if they can recon∣cile the same.</P>
<P><HI>R. B.</HI> pag. 895. of his Works, affirms, <Q>That the Historical Faith and Knowledge of Christ, is not commonly given to the <HI>Quakers,</HI> or to be expected by them, or any others, by the Spirit, but by the Scriptures.</Q></P>
<P>But in contradiction to this, p. 48. he affirms, <Q>That the Spirit teaches every true <HI>Christian</HI> whatsoever is needful for him to know. — By this Light of God [in the heart] all true knowledge in spi∣ritual things is revealed. <HI>Prop.</HI> X.</Q></P>
<P>Then back again, pag. 95, 96. he affirms, <Q>That the Historical knowledge or outward profession of Christ is absolutly necessary to be believed, where God affords the Opportunity of knowing it; — Yea (says he) it were a damnable Unbelief not to believe it, when declared.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="001248_0019_0FB18B6F32876CC0"/>Now the first and last of these three Quotations, are <HI>Christan,</HI> and the middlemost is <HI>Quakerism,</HI> which together runs thus;</P>
<P>'Tis Damnable Unbelief not to believe the history of Christ, where it may be known.</P>
<P>This historical belief is not given to men by the spirit.</P>
<P>And yet, The spirit teaches all true knowledge, and whatever is needful.</P>
<P>This needs no comment, I could shew several such like Contradictions and Confusion in <HI>R. B's</HI> endeavours to mix <HI>Quakerism</HI> with <HI>Christianity,</HI> just as Coyners of bad Money, mix it with some good Money, to make the bad pass current unsuspected.</P>
<P>There is an instance in page 170 of his <HI>Apology,</HI> That shews his accom∣plishment in Quaker-Pride. He there calls the Apostles of our Lord and Saviour by the name of <HI>outward Apostles:</HI> This is to intimate, that they (the <HI>Quakers</HI>) are inward Apostles, and they always prefer the inward above the outward; for as it sufficed for the Apostles and Elders to fall down and worship before the Throne; so G. F. says, The <HI>Quakers</HI> are UPON the Throne (as in the Quotations before.) Thus while they Banter others for Pride in wearing Lace and Ribands, they themselves are possest with the most abhorrent Pride of Lucifer.</P>
<P><HI>Lastly,</HI> Behold a monstrous clash of <HI>Quakerism</HI> and <HI>Christianity</HI> between <HI>R. B.</HI> and <HI>W. P.</HI> The one calls it a <HI>Damnable Ʋnbelief,</HI> not to believe the history of Christ, and the other calls it, <HI>A deadly Poison</HI> to believe it.</P>
<P>But their Books are so full of such confused stuff, it would be almost endless work to collect it. Therefore I and others who by the mercy of God have escaped out of this City of confusion, <HI>Mystery Babylon,</HI> cannot forbear calling others after us; some have done it late, even at the point of death, as <HI>Mary</HI> the Wife of Mr.<HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of <HI>Burlington,</HI> daughter of R B a <HI>Quaker;</HI> she on her Death-bed bewailed her dark state and condition of being trained up in Quakerism, ignorant of the knowledge and faith of the true Christ, cailling on her Sisters and Quakers about her, to take warning by her, and not delay to seek after Christ in time. Mr. <HI>T. Revell,</HI> his Wife, and those about her, not <HI>Quakers,</HI> will testify that this dying woman uttered those and the like words, with an affecting zeal; testifying a return of Gods great love in her heart before she departed. Therefore let those people know, that 'tis not the exchanging the life of a <HI>P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> for an <HI>outside Holines<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>,</HI> while the inside is full of such Rottenness in Faith and Principles, that will stand them in stead in the day of account.</P>

<P>Now I think none dare say of this Fury, that it proceeds of <HI>Good Will,</HI> therefore I shall at present give him no other answers but only send him back the two last lines in the Month of <HI>February</HI> o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> his own Almanack, where he himself tells us his dwelling-place, in these words;</P>
<P><HI>Where Good Will's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>g, there's a k<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d of Hell,</HI></P>

<P>As to <HI>Caleb Puss<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y,</HI> he has only printed his old stuff over again, the very same which was in his last years Almanack word for word (to which I have formerly made Reply) and has added nothing new but an Advertisement, wherein he (as common Strumpets call honest Women <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) cryes out <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Abuses and black Charges, which, he says, they have proved against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Yes, they have proved them just as I have before shewed, by Lying &amp; Sham Answers, on purpose to deceive. And as I have before noted, Their chiefest Preachers are the greatest Deceivers; yea, those who write not, as well as those who write. As for instance, <HI>John Saltkill,</HI> a Preacher of Renown, lately come from <HI>England,</HI> who, when he was in this Country before, being at the house of <HI>Sam. Carpenter</HI> in <HI>Philadelphia,</HI> with some other <HI>Quakers,</HI> took occa∣sion to speak of the printed Sheet, called, <HI>G. Keith</HI>'s broad Sheet of about 50 blasphemous and Anti-christian Quotations, taken from their friends books, of which he the said, <HI>J. Saltkill</HI> said, That <HI>there <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not one Quotation in</HI> G K<HI>'s broad Sheet, but what friends might safely stand by and justifie.</HI> And yet this man with his tongue as smooth as Oyl, and a bewitching Tone, deceives the People, by pretences to <HI>Christianity</HI> contrary to his own faith. <HI>Note,</HI> This Passage was told me by a <HI>Quaker</HI> then and there present, who obliged me not to tell his Name▪ And I would be just to him and all men; for I am not ignorant of their punishment to such as tell Tales out of School; tho' 'tis nothing but the same <HI>Jesuitism</HI> as runs parrallel with their whole Works, as I have sufficiently shewed.</P>
<P>Again, <HI>T. Chalkly,</HI> who is so wily a Preacher, that he makes some that are not <HI>Quakers</HI> think him to better than most of 'em, I have his Letter that he writ to me at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>our,</HI> where in he condemns me to hell because I had caution'd the People at <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gg-<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>our</HI> against belie∣ving that the Light within all men was sufficient to Salvation without any other means.
