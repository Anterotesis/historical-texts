<HEAD>THE DANGER OF <HI>Excessive Drinking</HI></HEAD>
<LG>
<L>HARD drinking is an evil great,</L>
<L>Makes people more prophane;</L>
<L>It ruins many man's estate,</L>
<L>And others brings to shame.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Young men, in their full strength and prime,</L>
<L>To taverns they will go;</L>
<L>There spend their money and their time,</L>
<L>Which proves their overthrow.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For there they get to playing cards,</L>
<L>And other foolish plays;</L>
<L>So they must have their just rewards</L>
<L>For all such evil ways.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some aged fathers act the same,</L>
<L>Though much to their disgrace;</L>
<L>To them it is both sin and shame</L>
<L>To frequent such a place.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="3" REF="025376_0003_0FCD104FE6488980"/>
<L>When men, with children and with wives,</L>
<L>Befool themselves with drink,</L>
<L>So that they lead unhappy lives,</L>
<L>Which makes their names to stink.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How many go about and beg:</L>
<L><HI>More Cider</HI> is the cry;</L>
<L>Their company good people dread,</L>
<L>Whenever they come nigh.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>'Gainst tavern-hunting some exclaim,</L>
<L>And let them much alone,</L>
<L>Yet fall into as great a shame,</L>
<L>By drinking hard at home.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>For bad examples they do set</L>
<L>Before their families;</L>
<L>So give their wives great cause to fret,</L>
<L>They bring on poverties.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>A damage to the commonwealth,</L>
<L>It strikes a deadly blow:</L>
<L>It spoils both reason, and the health</L>
<L>Of those that practise so.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some sprightly ones which once have been</L>
<L>Full of activity;</L>
<L>They lose the use of every limb,</L>
<L>Befool themselves and die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Many disorders bring about,</L>
<L>Intoxicates the brains:</L>
<L>Oft times it bringeth on the gout,</L>
<L>And other raking pains.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="4" REF="025376_0004_0FCD105174AA3168"/>
<L>Brings on many a hard disease</L>
<L>Which sweepeth like a flood,</L>
<L>Upon the persons they do seize;</L>
<L>Which so inflames their blood.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How many dangers they are in,</L>
<L>Who thus themselves disguise.</L>
<L>They that are guilty of this sin,</L>
<L>Are foolish and unwise.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Th' ill consequences they are great,</L>
<L>The dangers not a few;</L>
<L>They that go on at such a rate,</L>
<L>Death on them must ensue.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So prove to be poor vagabonds,</L>
<L>Great is their poverty;</L>
<L>They droop about like sottish drones,</L>
<L>Dwindle away and die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Some almost perish with the cold,</L>
<L>And others freeze to death;</L>
<L>So many die before they're old,</L>
<L>So thus they lose their breath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How many fall down by the way,</L>
<L>Are killed in the dark;</L>
<L>And so their lives are swept away,</L>
<L>This oft we may remark.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>How many perish by this means,</L>
<L>Who bite at Satan's hooks;</L>
<L>Thousands are drowned in the stream,</L>
<L>By drinking of their cups.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="5" REF="025376_0005_0FCD1052E82B4788"/>
<L>Liable to fall into the fire,</L>
<L>And there to burn to death;</L>
<L>Then suddenly they must expire,</L>
<L>To flames must yield their breath.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>The excess o'erspreads both sea and land,</L>
<L>Affects both young and old:</L>
<L>This they may truly understand,</L>
<L>And clearly may behold.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Seamen their spirits so inflame,</L>
<L>Scarce able for to steer;</L>
<L>So thousands perish in the main,</L>
<L>Large numbers every year.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By drinking brandy, rum and wine,</L>
<L>We justly may confess,</L>
<L>Their wives poor widows are become,</L>
<L>Their children fatherless.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Others unmans and makes them small,</L>
<L>Which fills their hearts with evil;</L>
<L>Liable to temptations all,</L>
<L>Much pleasing to the devil.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They then to evil so incline,</L>
<L>In filthiness so high;</L>
<L>Guilty of many a horrid crime,</L>
<L>For some of them must die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>With such intoxicated brains,</L>
<L>To lewd women they run,</L>
<L>To gratify their lustful reins,</L>
<L>Until they are undone,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="6" REF="025376_0006_0FCD1054CDA5F908"/>
<L>This causeth quarrels to arise,</L>
<L>Which is a shameful thing;</L>
<L>This breaks up many families,</L>
<L>And much disgrace doth bring.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They grow so factious and so mad,</L>
<L>They rise against each one;</L>
<L>Sometimes the consequence so bad,</L>
<L>That murder then is done.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>It causeth some to steal and rob,</L>
<L>Which both are very sad;</L>
<L>And many another villainous job,</L>
<L>And every thing that's bad.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In revelling some are so great,</L>
<L>They run to crimes so high,</L>
<L>That some are guilty of a rape,</L>
<L>For which wretches must die.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They that in such vile ways go on.</L>
<L>In this doleful excess,</L>
<L>For everlasting are undone,</L>
<L>And darkness must possess.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Wont such reform they must expire,</L>
<L>And quickly end their breath;</L>
<L>And land in everlasting fire,</L>
<L>But never burn to death.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Would old and young, both small &amp; great,</L>
<L>Forsake their drinking bowls;</L>
<L>Ruins both reason and estate—</L>
<L>Destroys thousands of souls.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="7" REF="025376_0007_0FCD1055E9A66E08"/>
<L>Innholders, O!—that you would mind</L>
<L>As far as in your powers:</L>
<L>Be to yourselves and others kind,</L>
<L>And not to keep bad hours.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But strive to keep your houses clear</L>
<L>Of drinking company:</L>
<L>May you the great Jehovah fear,</L>
<L>God give you grace to try.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Be faithful, true, equal and just,</L>
<L>And trusty to your care;</L>
<L>Lest in one day you should be crush'd,</L>
<L>And sink into despair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet I would say a few words more,</L>
<L>Myself to few confine;</L>
<L>I would advise some men, therefore,</L>
<L>To drink less rum and wine.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>No benefit unto your health,</L>
<L>This you may plainly see;</L>
<L>Nor no advantage to your wealth—</L>
<L>Sure this can ever be.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>An awful truth doth here present,</L>
<L>And truth will ever stand;</L>
<L>By this sometimes a sad event</L>
<L>Happens by sea and land.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sure this excess is far from right,</L>
<L>I dare for to maintain;</L>
<L>Causeth great admirals to fight,</L>
<L>Ten thousands then are slain</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="8" REF="025376_0008_0FCD105828FAE3F8"/>
<L>Some generals upon the land,</L>
<L>Their armies are made small;</L>
<L>By this, sometimes, we understand,</L>
<L>Many of them do fall.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>They are swept down then like a flood,</L>
<L>Upon the bloody plain;</L>
<L>Thousands of garments roll'd in blood,</L>
<L>Sometimes but few remain.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>By this ten thousands run aground,</L>
<L>Many grand merchants break;</L>
<L>Themselves and substance do confound,</L>
<L>Who drink at such a rate.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Drinkers, reform whilst you have breath</L>
<L>This is my heart's desire;</L>
<L>Before you're claspt in arms of death,</L>
<L>Sent to eternal fire.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now pray to God for pardoning grace,</L>
<L>Before it be too late;</L>
<L>Lest he give you no longer space,</L>
<L>Then sad must be your state.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>So let us learn these lines by heart,</L>
<L>And print them in our mind;</L>
<L>And from iniquity depart,</L>
<L>Be to ourselves so kind.</L>
