<HEAD>Treaty of Commerce between France and the United States of America.</HEAD>
<P>THE Most Christian King and the Thirteen United States of North America, to wit, New-Hampshire, Massachussetts-Bay, Rhode-I∣sland, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Penn∣sylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Ca∣rolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, willing to fix in an equitable and permanent manner, the rules which ought to be followed relative to the corres∣pondence and commerce which the two parties de∣sire to establish between their respective countries, states &amp; subjects; His Most Christian Majesty and the said United States have judged that the said end could not be better obtained, than by taking for the basis of their agreement, the most perfect equality and reciprocity, and by carefully avoiding all those burthensome preferences which are usual∣ly sources of debate, embarrassment and discontent; by leaving also each party at liberty to make res∣pecting navigation and commerce, those interior regulations which it shall find most convenient to it∣self, and by founding the advantage of commerce sole∣ly upon reprocal utility, and the just rules of free intercourse; reserving withal to each party the li∣berty of admitting, at its pleasure, other nations to a participation of the same advantages. It is in the spirit of this intention, and to fulfil these views, that his said majesty having named and appointed for his plenipotentiary, Conrad Alexander Ger∣ard,
<PB N="4" REF="029760_0003_0FE2589BE13E3930"/>
royal syndic of the city of Strasbourg, se∣cretary of his majesty's council of state; and the united states on their part, having fully empower∣ed Bejamin Franklin, deputy from the state of Pennsylvania to the general congress, and president to the Convention of the said state; Silas Deane, late deputy from the state of Connecticut to the said Congress, and Arthur Lee, counsellor at law: The said respective Plenipotentiaries, after exchanging their powers, and after mature deli∣beration, have concluded and agreed upon the following articles.</P>
<P N="1">Article 1.

<P N="2">Art. 2. The most christian king and the United States engage mutual not to grant any particular favor to other nations, in respect of commerce and navigation, which shall not immediately be∣come common to the other party, who shall enjoy the same favor freely if the concession was freely made, or on allowing the same compensation, if the concession was conditional.</P>
<P N="3">Art. 3. The subjects of the most christian king shall pay in the ports, havens, roads, coun∣tries, islands, cities or towns of the United States,

or any of them, no other, or greater duties or imposts, of what nature soever they may be, or by what name soever called, than those which the nations most favored are or shall be obliged to pay; and they shall enjoy all the rights, liber∣ties, privileges, immunities, and exemptions in trade, navigation and commerce, whether in pas∣sing from one port in the said states to another, or in going to and from the same, from and to any part of the world, which the said nations do or shall enjoy.</P>
<P N="4">Art. 4. The subjects, people and inhabitants of the said United States, and each of them shall not pay in the ports, havens, roads, islands, cities, and places under the denomination of his most christian majesty, in Europe, any other or greater duties or imposts, of what nature soever they may be, or by what name soever called, than those which the most favored nations are or shall be obliged to pay: and they shall enjoy all the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities, and exemptions in trade, navigation and commerce, whether in passing from one port in the said dominions in Europe, to another or in going to and from the same, from and to any part of the world, which the said nations do or shall enjoy.</P>
<P N="5">Art. 5. In the above exemption is particularly comprised, the imposition of one hundred sous p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r ton, established in France on foreign ships, un∣less when the ships of the United States shall load with the merchandize of France, for another port of the same dominion; in which case the said ships shall pay the duty above mentioned, so long as other nations the most favored shall be obliged to pay it; but it is understood, that the said United States, or any of them are at liberty, when they shall judge it proper, to establish a duty equiva∣lent in the same case.</P>

<P>THEIR High Mightinesses the States-Gene∣ral of the United Netherlands, and the Uni∣ted States of America, to wit, New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode-Island and Providence plan∣tations, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North-Carolina, South-Carolina, and Georgia, desiring to ascertain, in a permanent and equita∣ble manner, the rules to be observed, relative to the commerce and correspondence which they in∣tend to establish between their respctive states, countries and inhabitants, have judged that the said end cannot be better obtained, than by esta∣blishing the most perfect equality and reciprocity for the basis of their agreement, and by avoiding all those burthensome preferences which are usu∣ally the sources of debate, embarrassment and dis∣content; by leaving also each party at liberty to make, respecting commerce and navigation, such ulterior regulations as it shall find most conveni∣ent
<PB N="27" REF="029760_0026_0FE258F5C2525858"/>
to itself, and by founding the advantages of commerce solely upon reciprocal utility, and the just rules of free intercourse, reserving withal, to each party, the liberty of admitting at its plea∣sure, other nations to a participation of the same advantages.</P>
<P>On these principles their High Mightinesses the States General of the United Netherlands, have named for their Plenipotentiaries, from the midst of their assembly, Messi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>urs their deputies for the fo∣reign affairs; and the said United States of Ame∣rica, on their part, have furnished with full pow∣ers, Mr. John Adams, late Commissioner of the United States of America at the court of Versail∣les, heretofore delegate in Congress from the State of Massachusetts-Bay, and Chief Justice of the said State; who have agreed and concluded as follows, to wit:</P>

<P N="2">Art. 2. The said subjects of the States-General of the United Netherlands, shall pay in the ports, havens, roads, countries, islands, cities or places of the United States of America, or any of them no other nor greater duties or imposts, of what∣ever nature or denomination they may be, than those which the nations the most favoured are or shall be obliged to pay; and they shall enjoy all
<PB N="28" REF="029760_0027_0FE258F750FC86A8"/>
the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities and exemptions in trade, navigation and commerce which the said nations do, or shall enjoy, whe∣ther in passing from one port to another in the said states, or in going from any of those ports to any foreign port of the world, or from any foreign port of the world to any of those ports.</P>

grounds to be appointed for that purpose, as oc∣casion shall require: And the dead bodies of those who are buried, shall not in any wise be molested.

<P N="9">Art. 9.

<P>HIS Britannic Majesty and the United States of America, being desirous by a Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation, to terminate their differences in such a manner, as without refer∣ence to the merits of their respective complaints and pretensions, may be the best calculated to produce mutual satisfaction and good understan∣ding: And also to regulate the Commerce and Navigation between their respective countries, territories, and people, in such a manner as to render the same reciprocally beneficial and satis∣factory: they have, respectively, named their Plenipotentiaries, and given them full powers to treat of, and conclude the said Treaty, that is to say, his Britannic Majesty has named for his Plenipotentiary, the Right Hon. Wm. Wynd∣ham Baron Grenville of Wotton, one of his Majesty's Privy Council, and his Majesty's Prin∣cipal Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs; and the President of the said United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, hath appointed for their Plenipotentiary, the Hon.

His Majesty will withdraw all his troops and garrisons from all posts and places within the boundary lines assigned by the treaty of peace to the United States. This evacuation shall take place on or before the first day of June, 1796, and all the proper measures shall in the in∣terval be taken by concert between the govern∣ment of the United States, and his majesty's go∣vernor General in America, for settling the pre∣vious arrangements which may be necessary res∣pecting the delivery of the said posts: The Uni∣ted States in the mean time at their dis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ton ex∣tending their settlements to any part within the said boundary line, except within the precincts or jurisdiction of any of the said posts. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and traders within the precincts or jurisdiction of the said posts, shall continue to enjoy, unmolested, all their property of every kind, and shall be pro∣tected therein.

But it is understood, that this Article does not extend to the admission of vessels of the United States into the sea ports, harbours, bays or Creeks of his Majesty's said territories; nor into such parts of the rivers in his Majesty's said territories as are between the mouth thereof, and the highest port of entry from the sea, except in small vessels trad∣ing bona fide between Montreal and Quebec, un∣der such regulations as shall be established to pre∣vent the possibility of any frauds in this respect. Nor to the admission of British vessel from the sea into the rivers of the United States, beyond the highest ports of entry for foreign vessels from the sea.

<P>All goods and merchandizes whose importation into his Majesty's said territories in America, shall not be entirely prohibited, may freely, for the purposes of commerce, be carried into the same in the manner aforesaid by the citizens of the

And all goods not prohibited, to be exported from the said territories, respectively, may in like manner be carried out of the same by the two parties respectively, paying duty as afore∣said.</P>
<P>No duty of entry shall ever be levied by either party on peltries brought by land, or inland na∣vigation into the said territories respectively, nor shall the Indians passing or re-passing with their own proper goods and effects of whatever.

But as by this stipulation it is only meant to secure to each party a free passage across the portages on both sides, it is agreed, that this exemption from duty shall extend only to such goods
<PB N="72" REF="029760_0071_0FE259A81664D190"/>
as are carried in the usual and direct road across the portage, and are not attempted to be in any manner sold or exchanged during their passage across the same, and proper regulations established to prevent the possibility of any frauds in this respect.</P>

<P N="4">Art. 4. Whereas it is uncertain whether the Ri∣ver Mississippi extends so far to the Northward as to be intersected by a line to be drawn due West from the Lake of the Woods in the manner mentioned in the Treaty of Peace between his Majesty and the United States, it is agreed, that measures shall be taken in concert with his Majesty's government in America, and the government of the United States, for making a joint survey of the said river from one degree of latitude below the Falls of St. Anthony to the principal source or sources of the said river, and also of the parts adjacent thereto; and that if on the result of such survey, it should appear that the said river would not be intersected by such a line as is above mentioned, the two parties will there∣upon proceed by amicable negociation to regulate the boundary line in that quarter, as well as all other points to be adjusted between the said parties, according to justice and mutual convenience, and in conformity to the intent of the said treaty.</P>
<P N="5">Art. 5. Whereas doubts have arisen what river was truly intended under the name of the river St. Croix, mentioned in the said treaty of Peace, and forming a part of the boundary therein described, tha btuestion shall be referred to the final decision of Commissioners to be appointed in the following man∣ner, viz.</P>
<P>One Commissioner shall be named by his Majesty
<PB N="73" REF="029760_0072_0FE259B1A89BB0E0"/>
and one by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate there∣of, and the said two Commissioners shall agree on the choice of a third; or if they cannot so agree, they shall each propose one person, and, of the two names so proposed, one shall be drawn by lot in the presence of the two original Commissioners. And the three Commissioners so appointed, shall be sworn impartially to examine and decide the said question according to such evidence as shall respectively be laid before them on the part of the British govern∣ment and of the U. States. The said Commissioners shall meet at Hal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fax, and shall have power to ad∣journ to such other place or places as they shall think fit. They shall have power to appoint a Se∣cretary, and to employ such surveyors or other per∣sons as they shall judge necessary. The said Com∣missioners shall by a declaration under their hands and seals decide what river is the river S. Croix in∣tended by the treaty. The said declaration shall contain a description of the said river, and shall particularize the latitude and longitude of its mouth of its source. Duplicates of this declaration and of and the statements of their accounts and of the journal of their proceeding shall be delivered by them to the agent of his Majesty and to the agent of the United States, who may be respectively appointed and authorized <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>age the business on behalf of the respective governments. And both parties agree to consider such decision as final and conclusive, so that the same <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> never <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ereafter be called into question, or made the subject of dispute or difference between them</P>
<P N="6">Art. 6. Whereas it is alledged by divers British merchants and others his Majesty's subjects, that debts to a considerable amount, which were <HI>bona fide</HI> contracted before the peace, still remaining owing to them by citizens or inhabitants of the Uni∣ted States, and that by the operation of various lawful impediments since the peace, not only the
<PB N="74" REF="029760_0073_0FE259B382430678"/>
full recovery of the said debts has been delayed, but also the value and security thereof have been, in several instances impaire<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and lessened, so that by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings, the Bri∣tish creditors cannot now obtain, and actually have and receive full and adequate compensation for the losses and damages which they have thereby sustain∣ed: It is agreed, that in all such cases where full compensation for such losses and damages cannot for whatever reason be actually obtained, had and received by the said creditors in the ordinary course of justice, the United States will make full and complete compensation for the same to the said creditors; But it is distinctly understood, that this provision is to extend to such losses only as have been occasioned by the lawful impediments aforesaid, and is not to extend to losses occasioned by such in∣solvency of the debtors, or ohter causes as would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>equally have operated to produce such loss, if the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id impediments had not existed, nor to such losses or damages as have been occasioned by the manifest delay or negligence, or wilful omission of the clai∣mant.</P>
<P>For the purpose of ascertaining the amount of any such losses and damages, five Commissioners shall be appointed, and authorized to meet and act in manner following, viz. Two of them shall be appointed by his Majesty, two of them by the Pre∣sident of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate thereof, and the fifth by the unanimous voice of the other four; and if they should not agree in such choice, then the commissi∣oners named by the two parties shall respectively propose one person, and of the two names so pro∣posed, one shall be drawn by lot in the presence of the four original commissioners. When the five commissioners thus appointed shall first meet, thy eshall before they proceed to act respectively take the following oath or affirmation, in the pre∣sence of each other, which oath or affirmation be∣ing so taken, and duty attested, shall be entered on

B. one of the Commissioners appointed in pursuance of the sixth article of the Treaty of Amity, Com∣merce, and Navigation between his Britannic Ma∣jesty, and the United States of America, do so∣lemnly swear, or affirm, that I will honestly, dili∣gently, impartially, and carefully examine, accord∣ing to justice and equity, decide all such complaints as under the said article shall be preferred to the said Commissioners; and that I will forbear to act as a commissioner in any case in which I may be person∣ally interested.</P>
<P>Three of the said commissioners shall constitute a board, and shall have power to do any act apper∣taining to the said commission, provided that one of the commissioners named on each side, and the fifth commissioner shall be present, and all decisions shall be made by the majority of the voices of the com∣missioners then present; 18 months from the day on which the said commissioners shall form a board, and be ready to proceed to business, are assigned for receiving complaints, and applications; but they are nevertheless authorized in any particular cases in which it shall appear to them to be reasonable and just, to extend the said term of eighteen months for any term not exceeding six months, after the expi∣ration thereof. The said commissioners shall first meet at Philadelphia, but they shall have power to adjourn from place to place as they shall see cause.</P>
<P>The said commissioners in examining the com∣plaints and applications so preferred to them, are empowered and required, in pursuance of the true intent and meaning of this article, to take into their consideration all claims, whether of principal or interest, or balances of principal and interest, and to determine the same respectively according to the merits of the several cases, due regard being had to all the circumstances thereof, and as equity and jus∣tice shall appear to them to require. And the said commissioners shall have power to examine all such persons as shall come before them on oath or affir∣mation
<PB N="76" REF="029760_0075_0FE259B69FFF44D8"/>
or books, or papers, or copies, or extracts thereof, every such deposition, book, or paper, or extract be∣ing duly authenticated, either according to the legal forms now respectively existing in the two countries, or in such other manner as the said commissioners shall see cause to require or allow.</P>
<P>The award of the said commissioners or of any three of them as aforesaid, shall in all cases be final and conclusive, both as to the justice of the claim, and to the amount of the sum to be paid to the cre∣ditor or claimant: And the United States undertake to cause the sum so awarded to be paid in specie to such creditor or claimant with deduction; and at such time or times, and at such place or places as shall be awarded by the said commissioners; and on condition or such releases or assignments to be given by the creditor of claimant, as by the said commis∣sioners may be directed: Provided always, that no such payment shall be fixed by the said commissioners to take place sooner than twelve months from the day of the exchange of the ratifications of this treaty.</P>
<P N="7">Art. 7. Whereas complaints have been made by divers merchants and others, citizens of the United States, that during the course of the war in which his Majesty is now engaged, they have sustained considerable losses and damage, by reason of irregu∣lar or illegal captures or condemnations of their ves∣sels and other property under colour of authority or commissions from his Majesty, and that from various circumstances belonging to the said cases, adequate compensation for the losses and damages so sustained cannot now be actually obtained, had and received by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings: it is agreed, that in all such cases where adequate com∣pensation cannot, for whatever reason, be now actu∣ally obtained, had and received by said merchants and others in the ordinary course of justice, full and complete compensation for the same will be made by the British government to the said complainants. But it is distinctly understood that this provision is
<PB N="77" REF="029760_0076_0FE259C0CEDB3518"/>
not to extend to such losses or damages as have been occasioned by the manifest delay or negligence, or wllful omission of the claimants.</P>
<P>That for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of any such losses and damages, five commissioners shall be appointed and authorized to act in London, exactly in the manner directed with respect to those mentioned in the preceeding article, and after have∣ing taken the same oath or affirmation <HI>(mutatis mu∣tandis)</HI> the same term of eighteen months is also assigned for the reception of claims, and they are in like manner authorized to extend the same in parti∣cular cases. They shall receive testimony, books, papers and evidence in the same latitude, and ex∣ercise the like discretion and powers respecting that subject; and shall decide the claims in question ac∣cording to the merits of the several cases, and to justice, equity, and the laws of nations. The award of the commissioners, or any such three of them as aforesaid, shall, in all cases be final and conclusive, both as to the justice of the claim, and the amount of the sum to be paid to the claimant; and his Bri∣tannic Majesty undertakes to cause the same to be paid to such claimant in specie, without any deduc∣tion, at such place or places, and at such time or times as shall be awarded by the said commissioners, and on condition of such releases or assignments to be given by the claimants, as by the said commis∣sioners may be directed.</P>
<P>And whereas certain merchants and others his Majesty's subjects complain that in the course of the war they have sustained loss and damage by reason of the capture of the vessels and merchandize taken within the limits and jurisdiction of the states, and brought into the ports of the same, or taken by ves∣sels originally armed in ports of the said states.</P>
<P>It is agreed that in all such cases where restitu∣tion shall not have been made agreeably to the tenor of the letter from Mr. Jefferson to Mr. Hammond, dated at Philadelphia, Sept. 5, 1793, a copy of
<PB N="78" REF="029760_0077_0FE259C25DF7B508"/>
which is annexed to this treaty; the complaints of the parties shall be and hereby are referred to the commissioners to be appointed by virtue of this arti∣cle, who are hereby authorized and required to pro∣ceed in the like manner relative to these as to the other cases committed to them: and the United States undertake to pay to the complainants or claimants in specie, without deduction, the amount of such sums as shall be awarded to them respective∣ly by the said commissioners, and at the times and places which in such awards shall be specified; and on conditions of such releases or assignments to be given by the claimants as in the said award may be directed: And it is further agreed that not only the now existing cases of both descriptions but also all such as shall exist at the time of exchanging the ratifications of this treaty, shall be considered within the provisions, intent and meaning of this article.</P>
<P N="8">Art. 8. It is further agreed, that the commis∣sioners mentioned in the two preceding articles shall be respectively paid in such manner as shall be agreed between the two parties; such agreement being to be settled at the time of the exchange of the ratification of this treaty. And all other expences attending the said commissions shall be defrayed jointly by the two parties, the same being previously ascertained and allowed by the majority of the com∣missioners. And in the case of death, sickness or ne∣cessary absence, the place of every such commissioner respectively shall be supplied in the same manner as such commissioner was appointed, and the new com∣missioner shall take the same oath or affirmation and do the same duties.</P>
<P N="9">Art. 9. It is agreed that British subjects who now hold lands in the territories of the United States, and American citizens who now hold lands in the domi∣nions of his Majesty shall continue to hold them ac∣cording to the nature and tenure of their respective states and titles therein; and may grant, sell, or de∣vise the same to whom they please, in like manner as
<PB N="79" REF="029760_0078_0FE259C3EA2ABD20"/>
if they were natives; and that neither they nor their heirs or assigns shall so far as may respect the said lands and the legal remedies incident thereto, be re∣garded as aliens.</P>

Neither the debts due from individu∣als of the one nation, to individuals of the other, nor shares nor monies which they may have have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks shall ever in any event of war or national dif∣ferences be sequestered or confiscated, it being unjust and impolitic that debts and engagements contract∣ed and made by individuals having confidence in each other, and in their respective governments, should ever be destroyed or impaired by national au∣thority on account of national differences and dis∣contents.</P>
<P N="11">Art. 11. It is agreed between his Majesty and the United States of America, that there shall be a reciprocal and entirely perfect liberty of navigation and commerce between their respective people, in the manner, under the limitations and on the conditions specified in the following articles.</P>
<P N="12">Art. 12. His Majesty consents that it shall and may be lawful during the time herein after limited for the citizens of the United States to carry to any of his Majesty's islands and ports in the West-Indies from the United States, in their own vessels, not being above the burthen of seventy tons, any goods or merchandizes being of the growth, manufacture or produce of the said states, which it is or may be lawful to carry to the said islands or ports from the said states in British vessels; and that the said American vessels shall be subject there to no other other or higher tonnage duties or charges than shall be payable by British vessels in the ports of the United States; and that the car∣goes of the said American vessels shall be subject there to no other or higher duties or charges than shall be payable on the like articles if imported there from the said states in British vessels.</P>
<P>And his Majesty also consents that it shall be law∣ful for the said American citizens to purcase, load
<PB N="80" REF="029760_0079_0FE259C579D1BE18"/>
and carry away in their said vessels to the U. States from the said islands and ports all such articles being of the growth, manufacture or produce of the said islands as may now by law be carried from thence to the said states in British vessels and subject only to the same duties and charges on exportation, to which British vessels and their cargoes are or shall be sub∣ject in similar circumstances.</P>
<P>Provided always that the said American vessels do carry and land their cargoes in the United States on∣ly, it being expressly agreed and declared that dur∣ing the continuance of this article, the United States will prohibit and restrain the carrying any molasses, sugar, coffee, cocoa or cotton in American vessels, either from his Majesty's islands or from the United States to any part of the world except the United States, reasonable sea stores excepted. Provided also, that it shall and may be lawful, during the same pe∣riod, for British vessels to Import from the said islands into the United States, and to export from the United States to the said islands, all articles whatever being of the growth, produce or manufacture of the said islands, or of the United States respectively, which now may, by the laws of the said states, be so im∣ported and exported. And that the cargoes of the said British vessels shall be subject to no other or higher duties or charges, than shall be payable on the same articles, if so imported or exported in American vessels.</P>
<P>It is agreed that this article and every matter and thing therein contained shall continue to be in force during the continuance of the war, in which his Ma∣jesty is now engaged; and also for two years from and after the day of the signature of the preliminary or other articles of peace by which the same may be terminated.</P>
<P>And it is further agreed, that at the expiration of the said term, the two contracting parties will en∣deavour further to regulate their commerce in this respect, according to the situation in which his Ma∣jesty
<PB N="81" REF="029760_0080_0FE259CF58E496D0"/>may then find himself with respect to the West-Indies, and with a view to such arrangements as may best conduce to the mutual advantage and exten∣sion of commerce. And the said parties will then also renew their discussions, and endeavour to agree, whether in any and what cases, neutral vessels shall protect enemy's property; and in what cases provi∣sions and other articles, not generally contraband, may become such. But in the mean time their con∣duct towards each other in these respects, shall be re∣gulated by the articles herein after inserted on those subjects.</P>
<P N="13">Art. 13. His Majesty consents that the vessels belonging to the citizens of the United States of America, shall be admitted and hospitably received in all the sea ports and harbours of the British ter∣ritories in the East Indies. And that the citizens of the said United States may freely carry on a trade between the said territories and the said United States, in all articles, of which the importation or exportation respectively to or from the said territo∣rie, shall not entirely be prohibited. Provided only that it shall not be lawful for them in any time of war between the British government and any other power or state whatever, to export from the said territories, without the special permission of the Bri∣tish government there, any military stores or naval stores or rice. The citizens of the United States shall pay for their vessels when admitted into the said ports no other or higher tonnage duty than shall be payable on British vessels when admitted in∣to the ports of the United States. And they shall pay no other or higher duties or charges on the im∣portation or exportation of the cargoes of the said vessels, than shall be payable on the same articles when imported or exported in British vessels. But it is expressly agreed, that the vessels of the United States shall not carry any of the articles exported by them from the said British territories to any port or place except to some port or place in America, where

It also understood that the permission granted by this arti∣cle is not to extend to allow the vessels of the Unit∣ed States to carry on any part of the coasting trade of the said British territories; but vessels going with their original cargoes, or part thereof, from one port of discharge to another are not to be consider∣ed as carrying on the coasting trade. Neither is this article to be construed to allow the citizens of the said states to settle or reside within the said territo∣ries, or to go into the interior parts thereof, with∣out the permission of the British government esta∣blished there; and if any trangression should be at∣tempted against the regulations of the British go∣vernment in this respect, the observance of the same shall and may be enforced against the citizens of America in the same manner as against British sub∣jects or others trangressing the same rule. And the citizens of the United States whenever they arrive in any port or harbor in the said territories, or if they should be permitted in manner aforesaid, to go to any other place therein, shall always be subject to the laws, government and jurisdiction of what nature established in such harbor, port or place, according as the same may be: The citizens of the United States, may also touch for refreshment at the island of St. Helena, but subject in all respects to such re∣gulations as the British government may from time to time establish there.</P>
<P N="14">Art. 14. There shall be between all the dominions of his majesty in Europe and the territories of the United States a reciprocal and perfect liberty of com∣merce and navigation. The people and inhabitants of the two countries respectively shall have liberty freely and securely and without hindrance and mo∣lestation

<P N="15">Art. 15. It is agreed that no other or higher du∣ties shall be paid by the ships or merchandize of the one party in the ports of the other, than such as are paid by the like vessels or merchandize of all other nations. Nor shall any other o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her duty be im∣posed in one country on the importation of any ar∣ticles the growth, produce or manufacture of the other than are or shall be payable on the im∣portation of the like articles being of the growth pro∣duce or manufacture of any other foreign country. Nor shall any prohibition be imposed on the expor∣tation or importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two parties respectively, which shall not equally extend to all other nations.</P>
<P>But the British government reserves to itself the right of imposing on American vessels entering into the British ports in Europe a tonnage duty equal to that which shall be payable by British vessels in the ports of America: And also such duty as may be adequate to countervail the difference of duty now payable on the importation of European and Asiatic goods when imported into the United States in Bri∣tish or in American vessels.</P>
<P>The two parties agree to treat for the more exact equalization of the duties on the respective naviga∣tion of their subjects and people in such manner as may be most beneficial to the two countries.

In the interval it is agreed, that the United States will not impose any new or additional tonnage duties on British vessels, nor in∣crease the now subsisting difference between the du∣ties payable on the importation of any article in Bri∣tish or in American vessels.</P>
<P N="16">Art. 16. It shall be free for the two contracting parties, respectively to appoint consuls for the pro∣tection of trade, to reside in the dominions and ter∣ritories aforesaid, and the said consuls shall enjoy those liberties and rights which belong to them by reason of their function. But before any consul shall act as such he shall be in the usual forms approved and admitted by the party to whom he is sent; and it is hereby declared to be lawful and proper, that in case of illegal or improper conduct towards the laws or government, a council may either be punish∣ed according to law, if the laws will reach the case or be dismissed, or even sent back, the offended go∣vernment assigning to the other their reasons for the same.</P>
<P>Either of the parties may except from the residence of consuls such particular places as such party shall judge proper to be so excepted.</P>
<P N="17">Art. 17. It is agreed, that in all cases where ves∣sels shall be captured or detained on just suspicion of having on board enemy's property, or of carrying to the enemy any of the articles which are contraband of war: the said vessel shall be brought to the nearest or most convenient port; and if any property of an enemy should be found on board such vessel, that part only which belongs to the enemy shall be made prize, and the vessel shall be at liberty to proceed with the remainder without any impediment. And it is agreed, that all proper measures shall be taken to prevent de∣lay, in deciding the cases of ships or cargoes so brought in for adjudication; and in the payment or recovery of any indemnification adjudged or agreed to be paid to the masters or owners of such ships.</P>
<P N="18">Art. 18. In order to regulate what is in future
<PB N="85" REF="029760_0084_0FE259DDF7DE0468"/>to be deemed contraband of war, it is agreed, that under the said denomination shall be comprized all arms and implements serving for the purposes of war, by land or sea, such as cannon, muskets, mor∣tars, petards, bombs, grenados, carcasses, saucisses, carriages for cannons, musket rests, bandoliers, gun powder, match, saltpetre, ball, pikes, swords, head pieces, cuirasses, halberts, lances, javelines, horse-furniture, holsters, belts, and generally all other im∣plements of war; as also timber for ship building, tar, or rosin, copper in sheets, sails hemp and cor∣dage, and generally whatever may serve directly to the equipment of vessels, unwrought iron and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ir planks only excepted; and all the above articles are hereby declared to be just objects of confiscation, whenever they are attempted to be carried to an enemy.</P>
<P>And whereas the difficulty of agreeing on the pre∣cise cases in which alone provisions and other arti∣cles not generally contraband may be regarded as such, renders it expedient to provide against the in∣conveniencies and misunderstandings which might thence arise: It is further agreed, that whenever any such articles so becoming contraband according to the existing laws of nations, shall for that reason be seized, the same shall not be confiscated, but the own∣ers thereof shall be speedily and completely indem∣nified; and the captors, or in their default the go∣vernment under whose authority they act, shall pay to the masters or owners of such vessel the full value of all articles, with a reasonable mercantile profit thereon, together with the freight, and also the de∣murrage incident to such detention.</P>
<P>And whereas it frequently happens, that vessels sail for a port or place belonging to an enemy, with∣out knowing that the same is either besieged, block∣aded or invested; it is agreed, that every vessel so circumstanced may be turned away from such port or place, but she shall not be detained nor her cargo, if not contraband, be confiscated, unless after notice
<PB N="86" REF="029760_0085_0FE24BE8F27DE740"/>she shall again attempt to enter; but she shall be per∣mitted to go to any port or place she may think pro∣per: Nor shall any vessel or goods of either party, that may have entered into such port or place, before the same was besieged, blockaded or invested by the other, and be found therein after the reduction or surrender of such place, be liable to confiscation, but shall be restored to the owners or proprietors thereof.</P>
<P N="19">Art. 19. And that more abundant care be taken for the security of the respective subjects and citizens of the contracting parties, and to prevent their suf∣fering injuries by the men of war, or privateers of either party, all commanders of ships of war and privateers and all others the said subjects and citi∣zens shall forbear to do any damage to those of the other party, or committing any outrage against them, and if they act to the contrary, they shall be punish∣ed, and shall also be bound in their persons and es∣tates to make satisfaction and reparation for all da∣mages, and the interest thereof, of whatever nature the said damages may be.</P>
<P>For this cause all commanders of privateers be∣fore they receive their commissions shall hereafter be obliged to give before a competent judge, sufficient security by at least two responsible sureties, who have no interest in the said privateer, each of whom, to∣gether with the said commander, shall be jointly and severally bound in the sum of fifteen hundred pounds sterling, or if such ships be provided with above one hundred and fifty seamen or soldiers, in the sum of three thousand pounds sterling, to satisfy all damages and injuries, which the said privateer or officers or men, or any of them may do or commit during their cruise, contrary to the tenor of this treaty, or to the laws and instructions for regulating their conduct; and further that in all cases of aggressions the said commissions shall be revoked and annuled.</P>
<P>It is also agreed, that whenever a judge of a court of admiralty of either of the parties, shall pronounce sentence against any vessel of goods or property be∣longing
<PB N="87" REF="029760_0086_0FE259E240CA9F18"/>to the subjects or citizens of the other par<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> a formal and duly authenticated copy of all the proceedings in the cause, and of the said sentence shall if required be delivered to the commander of the said vessel, without the smallest delay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e paying all legal fees and demands for the same.</P>
<P N="20">Art. 20. It is further agreed that both the said contracting parties, shall not only refuse to receive any pirates into any of their ports, havens, or towns, or permit any of their inhabitants to receive, pro∣tect, harbour, conceal or assist them in any manner, but will bring to condign punishment all such inha∣bitants as shall be guilty of such acts or offences.</P>
<P>And all their ships with the goods or merchan∣dizes taken by them and brought into port of either of the said parties, shall be seized as far as they can be discovered, and shall be restored to the owners or the factors or agents duly deputed and authorized in writing by them (proper evidence being first in the court of admiralty for proving the property) even in case such effects should have passed into other hands by sale, if it be proved that the buyers knew or had good reason to believe, or suspect that they had been piratically taken.</P>
<P N="21">Art. 21. It is likewise agreed, that the subjects and citizens of the two nations, shall not do any acts of hostility or violence against each other, nor ac∣cept commissions or instructions so to act from any foreign prince or state, enemies to the other party; nor shall the enemies of one of the parties be per∣mitted to invite, or endeavour to enlist in the military service any of the subjects or citizens of the other party; and the laws against all such offences shall be punctually executed. And if any subject or ci∣tizen of the said parties respectively shall accept any foreign commission, or letters of marque, for arming any vessel to act as a privateer against the other par∣ty, it is hereby declared to be lawful for the said party to treat and punish the said subject or citizen, having such commission or letters of marque, as a pirate.</P>
<P N="22"><PB N="88" REF="029760_0087_0FE259E4EC382508"/>Art. 22. It is expressly stipulated that neither of the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>d contracting parties will order or authorise any acts of reprisal against the other, on compl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> of injuries or damages, until the said party <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> first have represented to the other, a statement there∣of, verified by competent proof and evidence, and demanding justice and satisfaction, and the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>me shall either have been refused or unreasonably de∣layed.</P>
<P N="23">Art. 23. The ships of war of each of the con∣tracting parties shall, at all times, be hospitably re∣ceived in the ports of the other, their officers and crews paying due respect to the laws and govern∣ment of the country. The officers shall be treated with that respect which is due to the commissions which they bear; and if any insult should be offered to them by any of the inhabitants, all offenders in this respect shall be punished as disturbers of the peace and amity between the two countries. And his majesty consents that in case an American vessel, should by stress of weather, danger from enemies or other misfortunes be reduced to the necessity of seeking shelter in any of his majesty's ports, into which such vessel could not in ordinary cases claim to be admitted, she shall, on manifesting that neces∣sity to the satisfaction of the government of the place, be hospitably received and permitted to refit and to purchase at the market price such necessaries, as she may stand in need of, conformably to such orders and regulations as the government of the place, having respect to circumstances of each case shall prescribe. She shall not be allowed to break bulk or unload her cargo unless the same shall be bona fide necessary to her being refitted. Nor shall be permitted to sell any part of her cargo, unless so much only as may be necessary to defray her expen∣ces, and then not without the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>press permission of the government of the place. Nor shall she be obliged to pay any duties whatever except only on such ar∣ticles as she may be permitted to sell for the purpose aforesaid.</P>
<P N="24">Art. 24. It shall not be lawful for any foreign
<PB N="89" REF="029760_0088_0FE259ED5F910248"/>privateers (not being subjects or citizens of either of the said parties) who have commissions from any other prince or state in enmity with either nation, to arm their ships in the ports of either of the said parties, nor sell what they have taken, nor in any other man∣ner to exchange the same; nor shall they be allow∣ed to purchase more provisions than shall be neces∣sary for their going to the nearest port of that prince or state from whom they obtained their commission.</P>
<P N="25">Art. 25. It shall be lawful for the ships of war and privateers belonging to the said parties respec∣tively, to carry whithersoever they please the ships and goods taken from their enemies, without being obliged to pay any fee to the Officers of the Admi∣ralty, or to any Judges whatever; nor shall the said prizes when they arrive at, and enter the ports of the said parties be detained or seized, neither shall the searchers or other officers of those places visit such prizes (except for the purpose of preventing the carrying of any part of the cargo thereof on shore in any manner contrary to the established laws of Revenue, Navigation, or Commerce) nor shall such officers take cognizance of the validity of such prizes; but they shall be at liberty to hoist sail and depart as speedily as may be, and carry their said prizes to the place mentioned in their commis∣sions or patents, which the commanders of the said ships of war or privateers shall be obliged to shew. No shelter or refuge shall be given in their ports to such as have made a prize upon the subjects or citizens of either of the said parties; but if forced by stress of weather, or the danger of the sea, to enter therein, particular care shall be taken to hasten their departure, and to cause them to retire as soon as possible. Nothing in this Treaty contained shall, however, be construed or operate contrary to former and existing public treaties with other Sovereigns or States. But the two parties agree, that while they continue in amity neither of them will in future make any treaty that shall be inconsistent with this or the preceding article.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="029760_0089_0FE259EEED3A75F0"/>Neither of the said parties shall permit the ships or goods belonging to the subjects or citizens of the other to be taken within cannon shot of the coast, nor in any of the bays, ports, or rivers of their ter∣ritories by ships of war, or others having commission from any Prince, Republic, or State whatever. But in case it should so happen, the party whose territo∣rial rights shall thus have been violated, shall use his utmost endeavours to obtain from the offending par∣ty, full and ample satisfaction for the vessel or ves∣sels so taken, whether the same be vessels of war or merchant vessels.</P>
<P N="26">Art. 26. If at any time a rupture should take place (which God forbid) between his Majesty and the United States, the Merchants and others of each of the two nations residing in the dominions of the other shall have the privilege of remaining and con∣tinuing their trade, so long as they behave peacea∣bly and commit no offence against the laws; and in case their conduct should render them suspected and the respective governments should think proper to order them to remove, the term of twelve months from the publication of the order shall be allowed them for that purpose, to remove with their families, effects, and property, but this favor shall not be ex∣tended to those who shall act contrary to the esta∣blished laws, and for greater certainty, it is declared that such rupture shall not be deemed to exist while negociations for accommodating differences shall be depending, nor until the respective Ambassadors or Ministers, if such there shall be, shall be recalled or sent home on account of such differences, and not on account of personal misconduct according to the nature and degrees of which both parties retain their rights, either to request the recall, or immediately to send home the Ambassador or Minister of the other: and that without prejudice to their mutual friendship and good understanding.</P>
<P N="27">Art. 27. It is further agreed that his Majesty and the United States on mutual requisitions, by them respectively, or by their respective Ministers or
<PB N="91" REF="029760_0090_0FE259F07B35F198"/>Officers authorised to make the same, will deliver up to justice all persons who being charged with murder or forgery, committed within the juris∣diction of either, shall seek an asylum within any of the countries of the other, provided that this shall only be done on such evidence of criminality as, according to the laws of the place, where the fugitive or person so charged shall be found, would justify his apprehension and commitment for trial, if the offence had there be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> committed. The ex∣pence of such apprehension and delivery shall be borne and defrayed by those who make the requisi∣tion and receive the fugitive.</P>
<P N="28">Art. 28. It is agreed, that the first ten articles of this Treaty shall be permanent, and that the sub∣sequent articles, except the twelfth, shall be limited in their duration to twelve years, to be computed from the day on which the ratifications of this Trea∣ty shall be exchanged, but subject to this condition—that whereas the said twelfth article will expire by the limitation therein contained, at the end of two years from the signing the preliminary or other articles of peace which shall terminate the present war in which his Majesty is engaged, it is agreed, that proper measures shall by concert be taken for bringing the subject of that article into amicable treaty and discussion, so early before the expiration of the said term, as that new arrangements on that head, may by that time be perfected and ready to take place. But i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should unfortunately happen, that his Majesty and the United States should not be able to agree o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ch new arrangements, in that case all the articles of this treaty, except the first ten shall then cease and expire together.</P>
<P>Lastly. This Treaty, when the same shall have been ratified by his Majesty and by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and con∣sent of their Senate, and the respective ratifications mutually exchanged, shall be binding and obligatory on his Majesty and on the said States, and shall be by them respectively executed and observed with punctuality and the most sincere regard to good
<PB N="92" REF="029760_0091_0FE259F20E4CBC70"/>faith; and whereas it will be expedient, in order the better to facilitate intercourse and obviate difficul∣ties, that other articles be proposed and added to this Treaty, which articles from want of time and other circumstances, cannot now be perfected—it is agreed, that the said parties will, from time to time, readily treat of and concerning such articles, and will sincerely endeavour so to form them, as that they may conduce to mutual convenience, and tend to promote mutual satisfaction and friendship; and that the said articles, after having been duly ratified, shall be added to, and make a part of this Treaty. In faith whereof, we, the undersigned Ministers Ple∣nipotentiary of his Majesty the King of Great Bri∣tain and the United States of America, have signed this present Treaty, and have caused to be affixed thereto the Seal of our arms.</P>
