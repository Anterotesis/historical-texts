<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL><HI>Psal. LXXVIII. 34, 36, 37.</HI></BIBL>
<P>When He slew them, then they sought Him, and they returned and enquired early after GOD.</P>
<P>Nevertheless, they did flatter Him with their Mouth, and they lied unto Him with their Tongues.</P>
<P>For their Heart was not Right with Him, nei∣ther were they stedfast in His Covenant.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>AND this was the Wretched Issue of all the GOOD IMPRESSIONS which the Terrors of GOD had made upon them. 'Tis the story of what has been done millions of times; of what is daily done by millions of Men! O! may we, on whom <HI>the End of the World is come,</HI> and who have had <HI>these things written for our Admonition,</HI> take warning from it!</P>
<P>The Psalm which relates the matter, contains a compendious <HI>Church-History,</HI> of Divine <HI>Favours</HI> conferred, and of Divine <HI>Judgments</HI> inflicted, on
<PB N="4" REF="002908_0005_0FE692F69961A670"/>the Nation of <HI>Israel,</HI> from their Bondage in <HI>Egypt</HI> even to the Reign of <HI>David.</HI> The Rebellions of that People, against the glorious JEHOVAH, who made them His People, and His wondrous Patience, and Mercy, and Justice, towards them, under these Rebellions, are the main subject of this History.</P>
<P>In the particular Article we have now before us;</P>
<P>Behold, first, a poor People under <HI>Good Im∣pressions</HI> in a time of <HI>Danger;</HI> and from an Appre∣hension of the Glorious GOD coming to <HI>slay</HI> them. He <HI>slew</HI> some of them; Yea, an Horrendous EARTHQUAKE, was the way wherein He <HI>slew</HI> a Number of them. The Survivers were a while under <HI>Good Impressions</HI> from such occurrences. When they were afraid, that GOD was going to <HI>slay</HI> them, yea, to <HI>Damn</HI> them, for their Sins, <HI>Then</HI> they Bethought themselves; <HI>Then</HI> they thought they would become the <HI>Diligent Seekers</HI> of GOD; <HI>Then</HI> they thought they would no more Despise their SAVIOUR. But then,</P>
<P>Behold, next, what becomes of all these <HI>Good Impressions,</HI> when the <HI>Danger</HI> seems to be a little over with them. They are not <HI>Effectual</HI> ones; They are not <HI>Abiding</HI> ones; They all go off, with miserable Demonstrations, that their <HI>Hearts</HI> were the same they were before. They are not <HI>Sincere,</HI> and so they are not <HI>stedfast</HI> in the Declarations they made, when the <HI>Good Impressions</HI> were upon them. It becomes apparent, that all their short lived <HI>Piety</HI> was but <HI>Flattery.</HI> The <HI>Good Impression</HI> what are they <HI>but a Vapour, which appeareth for a lit∣tle while, and soon vanishes away?</HI> They soon <HI>Ev∣porate.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="002908_0005_0FE692F69961A670"/>The Sinners in a very <HI>little while</HI> are just such Murmurers and Infidels, as they were before.</P>
<P>My Friends; There is a melancholly observa∣tion that I have made; <HI>A grievous Vision is declared unto me!</HI> What I have observed, must be the DOCTRINE which I am now to insist upon; But which, Oh! Allow me to say, <HI>I beseech you, Brethren,</HI> to do all you can for the practical Con∣futation of. 'Tis This;</P>
<P><HI>The sentiments of PIETY, and the GOOD IM∣PRESSIONS, which People have in the Time of DANGER,</HI> [Say, The Time of EARTH∣QUAKE] <HI>are too easily, too usually Forgotten, when they think the DANGER is over with them.</HI></P>
<P>There was a Notorious Exemple of this DOC∣TRINE, in the Infamous <HI>Pharaoh,</HI> whom a Sove∣reign GOD <HI>raised up, that He might show forth His power</HI> upon Him. GOD was Revenging on the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the Injuries that had been done by them unto His <HI>Israelites.</HI> No less than Ten Remarka¦ble <HI>Plagues</HI> did the wrath of the Almighty send upon them: and probably all of them within the space of <HI>one Month. A Month devoured them!</HI> So me∣morable were these <HI>Plagues,</HI> upon the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> that the <HI>Philistines</HI> Four Hundred years after spoke of them, with some Consternation; Yea, so me∣morable, that we find in Pagan Antiquity, the <HI>Egyptians</HI> did for many Hundreds of years with Mourning, and Howling, and lighted Candles, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ep up an <HI>Anniversary Commemoration</HI> of them. They were such terrifying <HI>Plagues,</HI> that tho' <HI>Setho∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>,</HI> the Successor of the King who was now upon
<PB N="6" REF="002908_0006_0FE692FC42C43C98"/>the Throne, did celebrated Exploits in the East, in the first Nine years of the <HI>Israelites</HI> being in the Wilderness, yet he durst not meddle with a little Handful of <HI>Israelites,</HI> in whose cause the GOD of Heaven had so appeared. One of those plagues, was accompanied, with terrible <HI>Thunders,</HI> that fil∣led the Land with <HI>Flaming Fire,</HI> and scattered <HI>Hot Thunderbolts</HI> upon it. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> too, the King, whom the old Chronologi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s distinguish by the Name of <HI>Amosis,</HI> was <HI>Thunder struck,</HI> into some <HI>Sentiments</HI> of PIETY, and show'd some <HI>Good Im∣pressions</HI> upon them. <HI>Pharaoh</HI> changes his Note: <HI>Moses,</HI> The Man of GOD, whom <HI>Pharaoh</HI> hated above all the Men in the World, even <HI>him</HI> does <HI>Pharaoh</HI> under his <HI>Good Impressions</HI> apply unto, and ask his <HI>Prayers</HI> for him. The Servant of GOD, foresaw and foretold what the <HI>Good Impressions</HI> would come to. Said he, Exod. IX. 29, 30. <HI>The Thunder shall cease. — But I know that you will not yet fear the LORD GOD.</HI> Methinks, I see <HI>Pharaoh</HI> Trembling while he hears the Almighty <HI>Thun∣dring,</HI> and sees the Corruscations in the Heavens, with which the Lord GOD Omnipotent, can strike the most haughty Monarch <HI>Dead in a Mo∣ment;</HI> [And before now, <HI>He has done so</HI>] He <HI>Trembles;</HI>— And who would not? He cries out, <HI>I am sorry that I have abused the People of GOD! I am sorry that I have despised the Servants of GOD! I am sorry that I have detained any thing that GOD has called me to part withal. I will do any thing that the Great GOD would have me to do!</HI> Well; The <HI>Thunders</HI> go over: <HI>Pharaoh</HI> outlives the <HI>Thunders.</HI> And now, How is it? Alas, He is <HI>Pharaoh</HI> still?</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="002908_0006_0FE692FC42C43C98"/>
Thus it is, even among <HI>Israelites</HI> as well as <HI>Egyptians.</HI> People who apprehend themselves in <HI>Dangers</HI> of a deadly Aspect upon them, do com∣monly Think and Speak many <HI>Good Things.</HI> But they do almost as commonly <HI>Forget</HI> those <HI>Good Things,</HI> when their Apprehensions are over. The Thoughts and the Frames, which are frequent with People, when they are <HI>frighted</HI> by <HI>Earthquakes</HI> and by other Dangers, are soon <HI>Forgotten!</HI> Soon <HI>Forgotten!</HI> The <HI>Frights</HI> are no sooner over, but People <HI>Forget</HI> the Thoughts, and the Frames, and the <HI>Vows,</HI> to which the Terrors of GOD awaken∣ed them. The Hebrew Name for, MAN, signi∣fies, <HI>Forgetful Man.</HI> I mind this Elegance and Emphasis, in the words of the Psalmist, Psal. VIII. 4. <HI>What is Forgetful Man, that thou Remem∣brest him!</HI> O <HI>Forgetful Man,</HI> Thou shewest what thou art, by nothing more than thy soon <HI>Forgetting</HI> of the <HI>Good Impressions,</HI> which <HI>Dangers</HI> make upon thee.</P>
<P>¶. We will begin with a more <HI>General Assertion.</HI> DANGERS of all sorts, especially all deadly <HI>Dan∣gers,</HI> often are most <HI>Hypocritically</HI> plaid withal. O the <HI>Hypocrisy</HI> in the <HI>Heart</HI> of Man, which is <HI>Deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked!</HI> All sorts of <HI>Dangers,</HI> do frequently drive People into some <HI>Sen∣timents</HI> and <HI>Purposes</HI> of PIETY: But when the <HI>Dangers</HI> are over, the <HI>Sentiments</HI> are worn away, the <HI>Purposes</HI> are laid aside; the PIETY is no fur∣ther prosecuted; and the <HI>Religion</HI> which was but a <HI>flash,</HI> is all forgotten.</P>
<P>First, We see, <HI>Dangers</HI> make People <HI>Devout</HI> and Serious. People use to be devoutly disposed, when deadly <HI>Dangers</HI> are impending over them. <HI>Affliction</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="002908_0007_0FE692FC619E1C10"/>and <HI>Affrightment</HI> is how often, the <HI>Mother of Devo∣tion!</HI> I wish, it may not be said, a <HI>Spurious Devo∣tion.</HI> Imminent and sensible <HI>Dangers</HI> of Death, make Men grow <HI>Thoughtful;</HI> and it will be strange, if the Advance of the <HI>Leviathan</HI> do not cause them to <HI>purify themselves.</HI> They whom a sense of <HI>Death</HI> approaching does not compel to some <HI>Sober Thoughts,</HI> what are they? Harden'd and Frantic — one can't say, <HI>What!</HI> — Not <HI>Rational Men.</HI> They do not act as Creatures exercising <HI>Reason,</HI> who cast off all Thoughts of <HI>Religion,</HI> when they have <HI>Death</HI> staring on them, scaring of them. It was once expostulated with a Malefactor in the Jaws of <HI>Death:</HI> Luk. XXIII. 40. <HI>Dost not thou Fear GOD, seeing thou art under Condemnation?</HI> But that was a Monster of a Man. Shall it be said of a Man, <HI>He does not Fear GOD, when he is in a Dan∣ger that looks like a sentence of Death upon him?</HI> Verily, 'Twill be a very monstrous Character.</P>
<P>We will Enquire, first, after the <HI>Ground,</HI> then, after the <HI>Proof,</HI> of this unhappy matter.</P>
<P>First; The <HI>Ground</HI> of it, is, A <HI>Conscience</HI> excited by <HI>Dangers</HI> unto its Operations. In deadly <HI>Dangers,</HI> the <HI>Conscience</HI> comes to operate. By <HI>Dangers,</HI> the Minds of Men are chased from those things which drown'd the Murmurs of their <HI>Conscience.</HI> Yea, in <HI>Dangers,</HI> People are compelled not only to bear the <HI>Murmurs</HI> of <HI>Conscience,</HI> but also the <HI>Whispers</HI> are turned into <HI>Thunders.</HI> There is a <HI>Preacher</HI> in the Bosom of every Man; and upon <HI>Dangers,</HI> this <HI>Preacher</HI> becomes a <HI>Thunderer.</HI></P>
<P>There are Three Things, which the <HI>Thundering Voice</HI> of CONSCIENCE will speak to People, when <HI>deadly Dangers</HI> are upon them.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="002908_0007_0FE692FC619E1C10"/>
One Admonition of <HI>Conscience,</HI> is This; O Man, There is the <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD in the <HI>Dangers</HI> that have now overtaken thee. <HI>Dangers</HI> don't come, nor so much as a <HI>little Bird</HI> fall into them, without the <HI>Providence</HI> of GOD. There is the Hand of GOD, in all the <HI>Dangers</HI> that are brought upon thee. GOD has taken thee into his Hand, when be thus brings <HI>Dangers</HI> upon thee. <HI>Conscience</HI> now subscribes to That; Amos III. 6. <HI>Shall there be Evil in a City, and the Lord hath not done it!</HI> O Thou exposed one, GOD is the <HI>Doer,</HI> in all the <HI>Evil</HI> that is hanging over thee.</P>
<P>A Second Admonition of <HI>Conscience,</HI> is This: 'Tis a GOD <HI>offended</HI> by thy <HI>Sin,</HI> who sends thy <HI>Dangers</HI> upon thee. Thou art a <HI>Sinner.</HI> Thy <HI>Sin</HI> has been an <HI>Offence</HI> unto GOD; Thy <HI>Sin</HI> makes thee obnoxious unto the <HI>Anger</HI> of GOD; lays thee open unto the <HI>Vengeance</HI> of GOD. It is a Thing of the greatest Importance, that the <HI>Displeasure</HI> of GOD, should not remain burning against thee; A displeased GOD is an Adversary, which — <HI>how can thy Hands be strong, or how can thy Heart endure,</HI> to encounter with Him <HI>| Conscience</HI> now subscribes to Thee; Prov. XIII. 21. <HI>Evil pursueth Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>A Third Admonition of <HI>Conscience,</HI> is This: REPENTANCE, REPENTANCE! <HI>That</HI> is the most likely way to escape thy <HI>Dangers.</HI> O <HI>wicked</HI> one, <HI>Forsake</HI> thy <HI>ways;</HI> O <HI>unjust</HI> one, <HI>Forsake</HI> thy <HI>Thoughts; Return to the Lord, and He will have mercy!</HI> If thou <HI>Repentest not,</HI> thou mayst Fear, that the <HI>Arrows prepared</HI> on the <HI>bent Bowe</HI> of GOD, will be let fly upon thee. The Language of <HI>Con∣science</HI> now is That; Jon. III. 8, 9. <HI>Turn every one from his evil way, — who can tell, but GOD
<PB N="10" REF="002908_0008_0FE6930D68096B90"/>may turn away from His fierce Anger, that we perish not.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Conscience</HI> begins to <HI>Thunder</HI> at this rate, and make a Noise like the hideous Rumblings of an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> it must needs throw the Threa∣tened People into some <HI>Religious</HI> Dispositions.</P>
<P>As a <HI>Supplement</HI> unto this Meditation, let this be added. The Glorious GOD throws Men into <HI>Dangers</HI> on this very <HI>Design;</HI> To make them hear∣ken unto what He speaks by the Mouth of His Deputy, their <HI>Conscience,</HI> to them. Truly, Syrs, this is the very <HI>Errand</HI> that your <HI>Dangers</HI> are sent upon. The <HI>Conscience</HI> in Man, may complain, as in Jer. XXII. 21. <HI>I spake unto thee in thy presperity; But thou saidst, I will not hear.</HI> Men are Deaf to <HI>Conscience;</HI> It Groans, it Cries, it Thunders, and they do not regard it. GOD now does cast Men into <HI>Dangers</HI> on this Intent; <HI>Man, Hear now, what thy Conscience has to say unto thee: It has a Message from GOD to thee!</HI> From this it is, that Men so <HI>seem to be Religious,</HI> when <HI>Dangers</HI> are upon them.</P>
<P>Secondly; The <HI>Proof</HI> of it; For this we will repair unto <HI>Experience.</HI> And, <HI>Hear this, O all ye People, every one of you:</HI> May we not say, 'Tis <HI>your own Experience.</HI> The <HI>Scripture</HI> tells us, of some; Isa. XXVI. 16. <HI>Lord, In Trouble have they visited thee; they poured out a Prayer, when thy Chastening was upon them.</HI> Yea, but our <HI>Experience</HI> will every day tell us, <HI>Lord,</HI> How many are they, who when they are <HI>afraid of Trouble,</HI> do say, <HI>They will visit GOD every day as long as they live!</HI> How many are they who <HI>pour out a Prayer,</HI> when <HI>Danger</HI> is up∣on them! O that the Sermon of this Day, might be a <HI>Sermon to bring unto Remembrance!</HI> How ma∣ny,
<PB N="11" REF="002908_0008_0FE6930D68096B90"/>O our dear People, How many of you, may <HI>Remember</HI> the <HI>Dangers,</HI> wherein you were at that pass; Jer. II. 20. <HI>Thou saidst, I will not Transgress! Remember</HI> you not, what you said, when you lay <HI>Sick,</HI> and like to <HI>Die</HI> of your Sickness, and pale <HI>Death</HI> look'd you in the Face, and you look'd on yourselves as <HI>deprived of the Residue of your years,</HI> and Summoned before the Tribunal of GOD? <HI>Then</HI> you said, <HI>Oh! If GOD will spare my life, I will do nothing but serve the GOD of my life: I will hate and loathe and shun all the Sin that once I loved; and lead a life of all Godliness and Honesty! Remember</HI> you not, what you said, when a <HI>Storm</HI> at Sea had almost swallowed you up, and you were cast into Horror, by the <HI>Horrible Tempest;</HI> Your <HI>Soul</HI> was <HI>melted because of Trouble;</HI> You saw yourselves going down into the <HI>deep Waters;</HI> You fear'd you were going down into the <HI>Eternal Burnings? Then</HI> you said; <HI>Oh! If GOD will please, that I may out-live this Death, I will never Sin against Him any more as heretofore! I will do nothing that may render my Death uneasy and unwelcome to me!</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Memorandums</HI> are not over yet. My Friend, <HI>Remember</HI> you not, what you said, when you were in the <HI>Land</HI> and the <HI>Hand</HI> of your <HI>Enemies;</HI> you <HI>sat in Darkness,</HI> and in the <HI>shadow of Death;</HI> and you had little Hope of ever being again in the Arms of those, who were now <HI>put far from</HI> you? <HI>Then</HI> you Cried unto the Lord; and you said; <HI>Oh! If the Lord will Restore me to my Liberty, with what an Enlarged Heart shall I run the way of His Command∣ments.</HI></P>
<P>And will the Daughters of <HI>Eve</HI> give me leave to be a <HI>Remembrancer</HI> unto Them? When the
<PB N="12" REF="002908_0009_0FE6930D86D51D70"/>Time of your <HI>Travail</HI> and your <HI>Trouble,</HI> and the <HI>perils of Child bearing</HI> drew near, and you conceived yourselves entring the <HI>Valley of the shadow of Death,</HI> You <HI>Then</HI> said, <HI>Behold, The Handmaid of the Lord! If the Lord carry me to and thro' my Time, I will for∣ever behave my self as becomes an Handmaid of the Lord.</HI></P>
<P>In fine, Do you Remember nothing of what you thought when you self the Earth trembling and rumbling in a tremendous <HI>Earthquake</HI> under you? Did not your <HI>Hearts</HI> then <HI>smite</HI> you for your keeping at a distance from your SAVIOUR; and for the various Miscarriages of an ungodly and unrighteous Life? And was it not the purpose of your Hearts, <HI>I will not offend any more?</HI></P>
<P>If you don't <HI>Remember</HI> what you said, GOD <HI>Remembers</HI> it; it is all down in the <HI>Book of His Remembrance.</HI> Perhaps, New <HI>Dangers</HI> and Sor∣rows are coming upon you, to bring it unto your own <HI>Remembrance; In the latter Days ye shall con∣sider it!</HI></P>
<P>I must now pass on to a Second Remark. But, one that <HI>is a Lamentation, and shall be for a Lamen∣tation.</HI></P>
<P>Secondly; Men use quickly to <HI>Forget</HI> how <HI>De∣vout</HI> they were, when their <HI>Dangers</HI> were upon them. T'was all but a <HI>Religious Pang.</HI> Ah, De∣ceitful <HI>Pang!</HI> like the <HI>Morning Cloud,</HI> and the <HI>Early Dew; It passes away.</HI> We read of some, Psal. CVI. 13. <HI>They soon forgot His Works.</HI> Even so, Men <HI>soon Forget</HI> what <HI>workings</HI> they had in their own Hearts, when they saw the <HI>Hand of GOD lifted up to smite them.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="002908_0009_0FE6930D86D51D70"/>
Of this thing, we are every where entertained with a mournful Evidence. The <HI>Bad lives</HI> of Men, make it most notoriously Evident. The most of Men lead <HI>Bad lives:</HI> They do not <HI>Live unto GOD.</HI> With what pungency may they feel it said unto them; <HI>Can you say,</HI> That you lead such a <HI>Life</HI> as you <HI>said,</HI> you should and would, when <HI>Destruction from GOD</HI> was a <HI>Terror</HI> to you? When our SAVIOUR was in the <HI>Temple,</HI> the Hearers that were <HI>Convicted in their own Conscience</HI> by what He said, <HI>Went out,</HI> and, <HI>Lo, He was left alone.</HI> Oh, How far, <HI>how far!</HI> — would it go towards break∣ing up the Congregation, if all should <HI>go out,</HI> who may be <HI>convicted in their own Conscience,</HI> that they do not live, as under the <HI>Terrors</HI> of GOD, they said, They would. A great Man once putting that Case to a good Man, <HI>How shall I order my life, that I may glorify GOD?</HI> He only gave him this Answer; <HI>Live as when you lately apprehended your self a dying, you thought you would live, if GOD would let you live.</HI> There are many who do not <HI>glorify GOD.</HI> And we may conclude, They don't <HI>live,</HI> as in their <HI>Dangers,</HI> they said, <HI>They would.</HI> Where one is <HI>Reformed,</HI> a Thousand are <HI>as they were!</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>whence does this come to pass?</HI> 'Tis, From the <HI>Spirit of the Old Covenant</HI> in Mens Inclinations and Resolutions. When the People of old were appall'd at the <HI>Lightnings</HI> and <HI>Thunders</HI> and <HI>Earth∣quakes</HI> of the Burning Mountain, they said, <HI>All that the Lord shall speak we will do.</HI> But it was with the <HI>Spirit of the Old Covenant</HI> that they said it. GOD therefore said upon it; Deut. V. 28. 29. <HI>I have heard the Voice of the Words of this People, which
<PB N="14" REF="002908_0010_0FE69314DC5042B0"/>they have spoken; They have well said, all that they have spoken: Oh! That there were such an Heart in them!</HI> — Even so. People remaining yet in the old <HI>Covenant of Works,</HI> will say, <HI>This</HI> and <HI>That,</HI> and <HI>they will say very well in all that they speak.</HI> Oh! But there is no more than a <HI>Voice of Words,</HI> in all that they have <HI>spoken:</HI> There wants a <HI>New Heart</HI> in them; There is no <HI>Heart</HI> in them to <HI>do</HI> what they <HI>say.</HI> Frighted People <HI>say,</HI> that they are <HI>Fallen out with Sin.</HI> But it is only from some <HI>External Compulsion</HI> upon them. The SPIRIT of GOD has not yet <HI>Internally Changed</HI> the <HI>Biass</HI> of their Minds: The <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> yet reigning in their Hearts is not extinguished. They <HI>say,</HI> They will set themselves to do the <HI>Things that please GOD.</HI> But they set themselves about it in <HI>their own strength.</HI> And thus, <HI>All</HI> presently comes to <HI>Nothing!</HI></P>
<P>No <HI>Dangers</HI> are enough to Convert a Sinner. I have seen Men brought from the <HI>Gallows,</HI> who yet have not been brought from the <HI>Wicked Courses</HI> which had brought them to the <HI>Gallows.</HI> In go∣ing to their expected Execution, they have decla∣aed unto me, <HI>That they had rather Dy that Afternoon, than return to the ways of wickedness which they for∣merly lived in.</HI> They have had a <HI>Reprieve,</HI> and a <HI>Pardon.</HI> But how after <HI>That!</HI> Alas, I have seen the <HI>Dogs return to their vomit;</HI> and go on still in their old <HI>ways of wickedness.</HI> Ah, sinful Men! If One <HI>went unto them from the Dead,</HI> yet they <HI>will not Repent.</HI> The Devils and the Damned, with the hideous Chains and Flames of the <HI>Horrible Pit</HI> appearing to them, would not cause them to <HI>Re∣pent.</HI> Should <HI>Hell</HI> be set open before their Eyes, and should they be held over the <HI>Smoke of the Tor∣ment
<PB N="15" REF="002908_0010_0FE69314DC5042B0"/>which Ascends forever and ever,</HI> t'wil do no∣thing to take out the <HI>Hellish Tang</HI> of <HI>Sin</HI> which is in their Souls. Till <HI>that</HI> be taken out by the <HI>Spirit of Grace,</HI> there will be no <HI>Frighting</HI> Men out of their <HI>Sin.</HI> He that is <HI>Filthy</HI> will be <HI>Filthy still.</HI> When the <HI>Dangers</HI> are over, you'l find it so!</P>
<P>We read of mighty <HI>Legions,</HI> who after they have been Damned for seven Thousand years, and have been actually, in the direful Torments of the Damned for one thousand of them, yet being let loose again, they play the <HI>Devil</HI> again just as they did a Thousand years before; and again attempt with a Satanic Assault of <HI>Temptations</HI> to disturb the <HI>Camp of the Saints,</HI> and with Diabolical Delusions and Stratagems, draw in those in the <HI>Hidden places of the Earth,</HI> who <HI>go up</HI> from under the <HI>Breadth of the Earth,</HI> to join with them in their War against the <HI>Holy ones. Hell</HI> it self won't fetch out the <HI>sinful Tendencies,</HI> in the Souls of the wicked. Not only <HI>if One went from the Dead</HI> unto the wicked that are not yet <HI>gone to the Dead,</HI> they will yet re∣fuse to <HI>Repent,</HI> but also if they that are there were permitted themselves to <HI>go from the Dead,</HI> yet even These would <HI>not Repent:</HI> Except with <HI>New Lives</HI> they should also have <HI>New Hearts</HI> given them from Above. They that <HI>go down to Hell,</HI> with the <HI>Lusts</HI> in them which were the <HI>Weapons of their War,</HI> and have their <HI>Iniquities</HI> in their very <HI>Bones,</HI> if they that have been <HI>shut up in the Prison,</HI> should <HI>after many Days be Visited,</HI> and Released; they would again be as wicked as they were before.</P>
<P>Be sure, <HI>Earthquakes</HI> alone, will not cure the <HI>Love of Sin</HI> in Men, and cause them to Turn and Live unto GOD. If People should feel what may
<PB N="16" REF="002908_0011_0FE69315016934C0"/>force them to <HI>flee for their Lives,</HI> with the utmost confusion, from an all-devouring <HI>Earthquake, — As they fled from before the Earthquake, in the Days of Uzziah King of Judah,</HI> — This will not cause them to <HI>flee from their Sins.</HI> If People should see what is not now a <HI>New Thing,</HI> the <HI>Earth open its Mouth, and swallow up</HI> their Neighbours by Hun∣dreds at a Morsel, and a multitude <HI>going down a∣live into the Pit,</HI> and the <HI>Earth closing upon them,</HI> yet in flying from the <HI>Tents</HI> of wicked Men at their lamentable Cry, <HI>Lest the Earth swallow up them also,</HI> — it would be no <HI>New Thing,</HI> if they do not fly from the <HI>Ways</HI> of Wicked Men. Are there not Nefandous Instances of People continu∣ing in the <HI>Actual Commission</HI> of Disorderly Things, even in the very Time of an <HI>Earthquake?</HI> Yea, People making themselves <HI>Drunk,</HI> and Reeling to and fro with <HI>strong Drink,</HI> while the <HI>Earth</HI> has just been <HI>Reeling to and fro like a Drunkard</HI> under them, and roaring against them? And <HI>Robberies</HI> com∣mitted, even while the <HI>Earthquake</HI> has afforded an <HI>Opportunity</HI> for the Theeves to exert their cursed. Faculty? Hardened Sinners! There is no Re∣claiming of them!</P>
<P>It is a Remark very near akin to This. How do amazing <HI>Thunders</HI> usually operate? People are <HI>Afraid</HI> even <HI>with much amazement</HI> under the <HI>Thun∣derclaps;</HI> Afraid of Irresistible and Far-terebrating <HI>Thunderbolts.</HI> When the <HI>Lightning is directed unto the Ends of the Earth, and after it a Voice roreth; and God Thunders with the Voice of His Excellency; God Thunders marvellously with His Voice;</HI> Lo, At this our <HI>Hearts tremble,</HI> and are even <HI>removed out of their place.</HI> But how quickly, how sadly, do the <HI>Thun∣ders</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="002908_0011_0FE69315016934C0"/>lose their Efficacy! The <HI>Thunders do cease,</HI> and yet Men do not <HI>Fear the Lord God,</HI> as when it <HI>Thundred,</HI> they say, <HI>They would.</HI></P>
<P>O the <HI>Inconstancy</HI> of our <HI>Carnal minds! Constant</HI> only in their <HI>Enmity</HI> to GOD! People seem to be very Good while they have the loud peals of the <HI>Thunders</HI> discharging over them; and they fear lest the Next Flash of the <HI>Lightenings</HI> render them a <HI>Pillar of Salt.</HI> But they are not the same after the <HI>Thunders</HI> are over, that they were in the Time of the <HI>Thunders.</HI> — How often have I thought! — O! If my dear Neighbours were disposed <HI>after</HI> the <HI>Thunders</HI> as they are <HI>under</HI> them! — How <HI>Happy</HI> would they be! How <HI>Holy</HI> would they be! What a Religious Neighbourhood; and how full of PIETY!</P>
<P>From this Remark on <HI>Thunders,</HI> I return to <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> which are of the same Family with them: And, my Remark upon them is, That it is very plain, the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> which have lately shook the <HI>Earth</HI> under us for many Hundreds of Miles, and which in many places have been con∣tinued for diverse Weeks together, have produced very <HI>Good Impressions</HI> on many Thousands of Minds. If there be a few <HI>Stocks</HI> and <HI>Stones</HI> and Prodigies of <HI>Impiety,</HI> which have had no <HI>Good Impressions</HI> made upon them from the <HI>mighty Voice</HI> of GOD <HI>sent forth</HI> in these <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> verily, they are not only most unaccountably <HI>Sottish</HI> Wretches, but even worse than <HI>Bruitish</HI> ones: I say, worse than <HI>Bruitish</HI> ones; For it might have affected even those profane <HI>In∣dolents</HI> themselves, to have seen the <HI>Horrors</HI> which these <HI>Earthquakes</HI> raised in the <HI>Brutal World,</HI> at the Moments of the Tremors: How the greater and
<PB N="18" REF="002908_0012_0FE69334C1FBFAF8"/>the smaller <HI>Cattel,</HI> and the very <HI>Dogs</HI> themselves, express'd themselves moved, and horribly terrified, when they felt the <HI>Earth</HI> moving under them. They that now had no Awe upon them, and no Sense of a Glorious GOD and their Duty to Him, and felt no <HI>Good Impressions</HI> on their Minds, what shall be thought of them! — I suppose, there were very few such <HI>Monsters</HI> to be seen, in our Land. No; There have been <HI>Good Impressions</HI> made upon the Minds of People every where in Town and Countrey. The like was never seen in our Land! The many that fly into the <HI>Covenant</HI> of GOD, as unto the <HI>Horus of the Altar,</HI> that they may be sheltered from the Mischiess of <HI>Earthquakes</HI> there, most certainly run thither with <HI>Good Im∣pressions</HI> on their Minds. Yea, there are multitudes with whom it is a Time of such <HI>Good Impressions</HI> as they never felt in their Lives before. But now, O! The Extreme <HI>Hazard</HI> which there may be, left these <HI>Good Impressions</HI> do <HI>quickly</HI> dy away, <HI>quickly</HI> wear off, <HI>quickly</HI> come to nothing: Extreme <HI>Haz∣ard,</HI> lest People anon be just what they were be∣fore, and <HI>will not yet Fear the Lord GOD,</HI> whose Voice has thus loudly called upon us. For my part, my Heart more <HI>trembles</HI> at this, than at an <HI>Earthquake.</HI>—</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Wherefore from <HI>Asserting,</HI> we will proceed now to <HI>Exborting.</HI> And, Oh! <HI>Suffer the Word of EXHORTATION,</HI> which is now in a <HI>Few Words</HI> to call upon you.</P>
<P>We are very sollicitous, that when our <HI>Earth∣quakes</HI> are over, the <HI>Good Impressions</HI> which they have caused may not be <HI>over too.</HI> But what was
<PB N="19" REF="002908_0012_0FE69334C1FBFAF8"/>it I said? — when our <HI>Earthquakes</HI> are <HI>over!</HI> Who can say when <HI>That</HI> will be! I will mention a Thing which is not generally known among us. The Celebrated <HI>Earthquake,</HI> which terrisied <HI>New∣England</HI> in the latter end of <HI>January,</HI> between the years 1662. and 1663. not only reached unto <HI>Canada</HI> to the Northward of us, and, as the French Historian says, <HI>Occasion'd incredible Desolations on the surface of the Earth for above four hundred Leagues throughout that Countrey:</HI> But also continued Five or Six Months together. Who can say, what may be our Portion? I am sure, there can be nothing more seasonable, than the <HI>Exhortation</HI> I am coming to.</P>
<P>We read concerning Two Ministers, upon whom our Lord put the Name of BOANERGES. The Name will signify, <HI>Sons of Earthquake,</HI> as well as what we commonly take it, <HI>Of Thunder.</HI> Our Lord in imposing that Name on these two Mini∣sters, might have Respect unto that Prophecy, <HI>I will shake all Nations, and the desire of all Nations shall come.</HI> These Ministers might have a Notable Delivery, as <HI>Nazianzen</HI> intimates, by the Advan∣tage whereof what they delivered might come like <HI>Thunder</HI> on the Hearers. But this is not all; There were to be mighty <HI>Commotions</HI> even like those of an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> in subserviency to the Interests of the Gospel; and our Lord would make a singular use of these Ministers in those <HI>Commotions;</HI> who were to carry the Gospel with a Force like that of <HI>Thunder</HI> also, thro' the Jewish Nation.</P>
<P>Oh! That one of the <HI>Boanerges</HI> were here to have the management of this EXHORTATION; and that he who is <HI>a Son of Earthquake,</HI> in Essays to
<PB N="20" REF="002908_0013_0FE69334DD2F1990"/>serve the Intentions of the present <HI>Commotions,</HI> might be a <HI>Son of Thunder,</HI> in bringing with it the <HI>Right Words</HI> that shall be <HI>Forcible!</HI></P>
<P>The EXHORTATION that now <HI>speaks</HI> unto you, and must not be <HI>Forgotten,</HI> is This. Let those that have had <HI>Good Impressions</HI> on their Minds from the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> which have newly <HI>shaken</HI> us, Be∣ware lest they lose the <HI>Good Impressions;</HI> Exceed∣ingly Beware, Infinitely Beware, lest when they imagine the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> are <HI>ceased,</HI> it appear that that their <HI>Heart was not Right</HI> in, and not <HI>Reach'd</HI> by, the <HI>Good Impressions,</HI> nor were they <HI>stedfast;</HI> But they Forget what they Thought and Said and Vow'd, when the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> were upon them.</P>
<P>At the Time of the Battel between those two Grand Robbers, which were disputing the Em∣pire of the World, there was a <HI>Great Earthquake:</HI> But the <HI>Business</HI> of the Battel so engaged the com∣batants, that they took not the least Notice of it. Few People have been so <HI>Busy,</HI> or so Drowsy, or so Stupid, as to take no Notice of the Repeted <HI>Shocks</HI> and <HI>Roars,</HI> wherein GOD has from a <HI>Trem∣bling</HI> Earth sent forth His Thundring <HI>mighty Voice</HI> unto us. I wish, we may not be so <HI>Busy</HI> about our Worldly Affairs and Pleasures, as to take too little Notice of what that <HI>Thundring Voice</HI> has de∣clared unto us. But we read of such a Thing as That, Hos. VII. 16. <HI>They are like a Deceitful Bowe.</HI> The Thing whereof there is a most grievous Haz∣ard, is, That the Wicked <HI>Bent</HI> of many Minds for the ways of Sin, having by the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> had some <HI>strain</HI> upon it, upon the <HI>ceasing</HI> of the <HI>Earth∣quakes,</HI> the <HI>Deceitful Bowe</HI> will return where it was; the <HI>strain</HI> being taken off, they will return to their
<PB N="21" REF="002908_0013_0FE69334DD2F1990"/>old <HI>Bent,</HI> and they will <HI>go on still in their Trespasses.</HI></P>
<P>O our dear People, and all you that have had the <HI>Right Thoughts of the Righteous</HI> by the <HI>Earth∣quakes</HI> at all awakened in you, Our <HI>Hearts Desire and Prayer to GOD</HI> for you, is, That the <HI>Good Impressions</HI> upon you may not end, in any thing short of a Thorough TURN to GOD and CHRIST and PIETY: And that such a <HI>View of Things</HI> as you had in the Minutes of the <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> may in an <HI>Effectual Work</HI> of Grace, abide with you; and the Fruit thereof be, that you will <HI>Fear GOD all the Days that you live upon Earth; and pass the Time of your sojourning here in the Fear,</HI> not of <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> but of the glorious GOD, who has <HI>the deep places of the Earth</HI> in His Almighty <HI>Hand.</HI></P>
<P>In order to THIS, let these <HI>Admonitions of the Lord</HI> find a due Entertainment with you.</P>
<P N="1">I. A NEW HEART, a NEW HEART, is the <HI>First Thing</HI> to be made sure of. Be sure, that you do not rest in a <HI>Superficial, Defective, Delusive Work,</HI> or stop short in any thing less than a <HI>Thorough</HI> CONVERSION, from the <HI>Error of your way,</HI> with a <HI>Work</HI> of <HI>Real</HI> and <HI>Vital</HI> PIETY upon you. A lamentable thing, is that <HI>work of the Wicked,</HI> which is a <HI>Deceitful Work.</HI> If the <HI>Heart</HI> be not <HI>Right,</HI> O <HI>Israelite,</HI> thou wilt not be <HI>stedfast,</HI> in adhering to thy <HI>Good Impressions.</HI> A <HI>Thorough</HI> CHANGE of STATE, and therefore and therewith a <HI>Thorough</HI> CHANGE of HEART, is requisite, that so the <HI>Good Impressions</HI> made upon you, may <HI>continue</HI> with you; <HI>In these is continuance, and so you shall be saved!</HI> Without a <HI>principle</HI> of PIETY, restoring to the Glorious GOD His <HI>Throne</HI> in your Souls, your <HI>Good Impressions</HI> from the <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> will be a sort
<PB N="22" REF="002908_0014_0FE693581A546AE0"/>of <HI>Mushrooms</HI> rising from the <HI>Earth,</HI> and presently Wither, and Moulder, and Crumble, and come to nothing. Unless the <HI>Love of GOD,</HI> which is the <HI>Root of the Righteous</HI> be implanted for a living <HI>Principle</HI> of PIETY in your Souls, your <HI>Good Im∣pressions</HI> will be like the <HI>Alcherva</HI> of <HI>Jonah,</HI> and Wither in a Night or two.</P>
<P>When the <HI>Earth</HI> was in <HI>its</HI> Convulsions, and threw you into <HI>yours,</HI> This was the <HI>First Thing,</HI> which threw you into Agonies; <HI>Alass, I am a miserable Unregenerate; I am still in my sins; I am not Reconciled unto GOD; I am falling into those Hands which it is a fearful Thing to fall into!</HI> And This is the <HI>First Thing</HI> that you have to look to. Oh! Look to <HI>This;</HI> That you may have a Thorough CONVERSION to GOD and CHRIST, and a Life of that <HI>Acquaintance</HI> with Him, whereby <HI>Good will come unto</HI> you.</P>
<P>But, How shall <HI>This</HI> be come at? Very surpri∣sing is that Command; Ezek. XVI. 31. <HI>Make your selves a New Heart.</HI> What? When, O Sinner, Thou art <HI>Feeble and sore Broken,</HI> and maystly <HI>Roar∣ing by reason</HI> of the <HI>Desperate Wickedness</HI> in thy <HI>Heart,</HI> from which, none but an Almighty GOD, <HI>Oh! wretched one that thou art!</HI> —None but an Al∣mighty GOD can <HI>deliver</HI> thee! It is none but an GOD even one who can transform <HI>Stone</HI> into <HI>Flesh,</HI> that can give thee <HI>Another Heart;</HI> None but one who can <HI>Create</HI> a whole World, can <HI>Create a Clean Heart,</HI> and can make a <HI>New Heart</HI> in a Sinner that is <HI>Accustomed to do Evil.</HI> Wherefore when our GOD bids thee, <HI>Make thy self a New Heart;</HI> His meaning is, <HI>Look unto me, to make it for thee!</HI> The <HI>Good Work</HI> begins, in an Hearty
<PB N="23" REF="002908_0014_0FE693581A546AE0"/><HI>Weeping and Making Supplication</HI> to GOD for a <HI>New Heart.</HI> Seeing and Feeling and Owning thy own <HI>Death,</HI> and <HI>lying among the slain,</HI> Oh! Make thy Moans and thy <HI>Groans,</HI> even <HI>the Groans of a deadly wounded Man,</HI> unto a GOD, whose <HI>Name</HI> is, <HI>The Lord GOD, Merciful and Gracious and abundant in Goodness.</HI> Groan at this rate unto Him; <HI>Turn thou me, O Lord, and I shall be Turned! O Great GOD, Make me a New Creature, and bestow a New Heart upon me!</HI> It looks <HI>Hopefully,</HI> —as if the <HI>Fear of GOD</HI> were actually <HI>beginning</HI> in thee, and as if the <HI>Beginning of Wisdom</HI> were dawning on thee, when thou art come into a <HI>desire to Fear His Name.</HI> The <HI>Good Work</HI> has its <HI>Beginning</HI> in the <HI>desire</HI> of it. GOD will be <HI>attentive</HI> to the <HI>Prayer</HI> of such as <HI>desire to Fear His Name. Life</HI> is beginning to shew it self in <HI>Breathing</HI> after it.</P>
<P>In short, The Method of CONVERSION is This. The <HI>Foundation</HI> of the work must be laid in a <HI>deep Humiliation</HI> of Soul, confessing, That thou art <HI>Unable</HI> to <HI>Turn</HI> unto GOD, and <HI>Unworthy</HI> that He should enable thee, and yet <HI>most Worthy</HI> to perish if thou do it not. Being thus <HI>Humbled unto the Dust,</HI> now <HI>Cry</HI> from thence to the glorious GOD. <HI>Quicken me, O GOD of Sovereign Grace, Quicken me, to Turn unto thee, and Fly unto my SA∣VIOUR.</HI> And hereupon <HI>Try,</HI> whether He do not Help thee. <HI>Try</HI> particularly, whether thou canst not give an Hearty Answer to the Calls of the Gospel. The Gospel calls, <HI>Be sorry for thy Sin. Try</HI> whether thou canst not Heartily say, <HI>Lord, I am sorry, I am sorry, that I have wandred from thee!</HI> The Gospel calls, <HI>Let the great Salvation which thy JESUS has for thee, be welcome to thee. Try</HI> whe∣ther
<PB N="24" REF="002908_0015_0FE693584D85BB20"/>thou canst not Heartily say; <HI>Lord, The Bene∣fits of a JESUS, are all welcome to me, all welcome to me!</HI> The Gospel calls, <HI>Resolve upon a Life of Obe∣dience to GOD all thy Days. Try</HI> whether thou canst not Heartily say, <HI>Lord, The way of thy Command∣ments, with paying of acknowledgments to Thee in all my ways, I Resolve upon it, I Resolve upon it!</HI>— Behold, Thy <HI>Calling and Election made sure</HI> in thy Arrival unto this.</P>
<P>To set the Matter in a yet further light; The CONVERSION so importunately urged for, is, A <HI>Translation</HI> from the <HI>First Adam</HI> to the <HI>Second Adam.</HI> Wherefore, O <HI>Convert passing from Death to Life;</HI> Get thy Heart very strongly affected with the <HI>Evil Circumstances,</HI> into which thy Fall from GOD in the <HI>First Adam</HI> has reduc'd and ruin'd thee. Let <HI>Horror take hold</HI> on thee when thou dost behold the Universal <HI>Disorder</HI> and <HI>Corruption</HI> with which the <HI>Poison of the old Serpent</HI> so imbibed has infected thee; and behold the Innumerable <HI>Trans∣gressions</HI> and <HI>Rebellious</HI> wherein thou hast wickedly <HI>denied the GOD that is Above.</HI> Go on to behold the violated <HI>Law</HI> of GOD binding thee over to suffer all the <HI>Evil that pursueth sinners:</HI> Behold the <HI>powers of Darkness</HI> enslaving of thee, and thy Soul cistempered and languishing with <HI>grievous Diseases;</HI> Behold how obnoxious thou art unto the <HI>Strange Punispment reserved for the workers of Iniquity</HI> in a Future World. And now, Fly away to the <HI>Second Adam</HI> for thy <HI>Help</HI> under all these Distresses; <HI>Help</HI> laid on one that is <HI>mighty to save.</HI> Behold the Blessed JESUS offering to take thee and make thee <HI>His own,</HI> and <HI>save thee to the uttermost.</HI> Beg of Him, and Hope in Him, That by the <HI>Sacrifice</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="002908_0015_0FE693584D85BB20"/>which he made of Himself on the <HI>Accursed Tree,</HI> and by Influences, derived from Him, all the Miseries convey'd unto thee from the <HI>Forbidden Tree,</HI> may be releeved and removed. Put thy Trust in the Blessed JESUS, for a <HI>life</HI> that shall be the <HI>Reverse</HI> of all the <HI>Death,</HI> which the unhappy parent of thy Flesh has entailed upon thee. En∣treat of Him; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, let thy Spirit fill me with the life of GOD.</HI> Entreat of Him; <HI>O my SAVIOUR, Fit me for, and fetch me to, all the spiritual Blessings of the Heavenly places.</HI> Rely on Him, as thy Redeemer. And this with a <HI>Comfortable Per∣swasion</HI> of thy <HI>Favourable Reception</HI> with Him. Thus a CONVERSION is accomplished.</P>
<P>But yet, efteem it not accomplished until you can say those Things, which are the Three Grand MAXIMS of <HI>Real</HI> and <HI>Vital</HI> PIETY.</P>
<P>The First. <HI>The serving and pleasing of the Glorious GOD, and my being and my doing of what may be a grateful Spectacle unto Him, who is acquainted with all my ways, is what I close withal as the chief END, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ch all my Motions are to center in.</HI></P>
<P>The Second. <HI>My Fyes are continually to a Glorious CHRIST, that I may be made Righteous and be made Holy by Him; and I long to have His Image instam∣ped on me.</HI></P>
<P>The Third. <HI>I do not indulge my self in any Ill Frame towards my Neighbour, but am willing to do as I would be done unto.</HI> —</P>
<P>Now, <HI>It is Finished!</HI> Now, thou shalt <HI>never be moved.</HI> Thus <HI>doing the Will of GOD</HI> thou shalt <HI>Abide forever;</HI> And so shall the <HI>Good Impressions</HI> that He has made upon thee.</P>

<P>The Great and lewd City of <HI>Lima,</HI> some while ago, felt an <HI>Earthquake</HI> that sunk a large part of it, and brought in the Sea hideously rolling over it. In their Great Perplexity upon it, the Survi∣vers profess'd much <HI>Attrition</HI> of Soul, and laid a∣side the Quarrels that were among them, and cried out, <HI>Our Oppression, our Injustice, and our Ex∣travagances have brought all this upon us.</HI> Those poor <HI>Spaniards</HI> may be our <HI>Monitors.</HI>—But I have not said all. The <HI>Sabbath-breaker,</HI> doubtless in the Time of the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> felt some Twitch∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>d some Wishes of a Misgiving <HI>Heart; The Holy GOD, who won't let the Earth rest under me, now lets me know, that if I go on to break His Holy Rest, He will send me where I shall have no Rest, nei∣ther Day nor Night, but the smoke of the Torment will ascend forever and ever. Lord, Help me to Sabbatize better than I use to do.</HI> But, What am I speaking of? Of SABBATIZING! The Thing which <HI>pure and undefiled</HI> RELIGION, either <HI>Lives</HI> or <HI>Dies</HI> withal. Our <HI>Sabbath!</HI> — NEW ENG∣LAND, Thy <HI>Sabbath,</HI> 'tis thy <HI>Beauty</HI> and thy <HI>De∣fence.</HI> Oh! let nothing of This World ever take away thy <HI>Crown.</HI> Let thy <HI>Sabbath</HI> be thrown a∣way

Where are the <HI>Housholders</HI> that <HI>Remember the Sabbath,</HI> and make <HI>all within their Gates</HI> to do so? Where are the <HI>Nehemiahs,</HI> who will do all they can to lay Restraints upon those, who would <HI>bring Wrath upon</HI> us by <HI>profaning the Sabbath?</HI> Can the <HI>Ministers</HI> of the Gospel do no more, that the Remote Inha∣bitants of their Parishes, where many stay at or near the Meeting-houses all the Time that inter∣venes between the two public Meetings, may be put into the Best Method of spending the <HI>Holy Time</HI> in the Best manner; and keep up the zeal of <HI>Sabbatizing?</HI> If we won't <HI>Rest</HI> with and in GOD on His Day, GOD will not suffer His <HI>Earth</HI> to Rest under us, or permit us to <HI>Rest</HI> upon it. A plain Countrey-man once being changed and rai∣sed into a <HI>Prophet</HI> of GOD, the Date of his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> phecies was, <HI>Two Years before the</HI> [Famous <HI>Uzztan</HI>] <HI>Earthquake.</HI> Now, having foretold, That in that <HI>Earthquake,</HI> the Lord would <HI>Rore out of Zion,</HI> he mentions the <HI>Transgressions</HI> that would call for such a thing. One of them is This; [Amos VIII. 5.] <HI>Ye say, when will the Sabbath be over?</HI> They could not forbear entrenching on the <HI>Sabbath</HI> with secu∣lar Affairs, or sensual Frolicks. It follows, <HI>And shall not the Earth Tremble for this?</HI> — An <HI>Earth∣quake</HI> ensues upon it.</P>

It were as bad as to leap into the direful Chasms of the Earth opening in an Earthquake, to do such a wicked Thing!</HI> When the <HI>Egyptians</HI> would venture into the Deep, at a Time when, as it is hinted in the LXXVII. Psalm, <HI>The Earth trembled and shook;</HI> what came of it? We read, Exod. XV. 12. <HI>Thou stretchedest thy Hand and the Earth swallowed them.</HI> Hardy sinner, Wilt thou velure on, to do as thou didst use to do? To do so is to challenge the <HI>out-stretching</HI> of that <HI>Hand,</HI> that can soon cause the <HI>Earth</HI> to <HI>swallow</HI> thee.</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Make Haste,</HI> and, Oh, <HI>Delay not</HI> Immedi∣ately to <HI>keep those Commandments</HI> of GOD, in which the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> made you think, <HI>Without any further delay, this Duty shall be complied withal</HI> Not only <HI>Sins of Commission</HI> but also <HI>Sins of Omissi∣on</HI> had in the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> the <HI>Reproofs of GOD</HI> given unto them. Truly, The Best Thing that can be desired for you, is; That you may <HI>order your Conversation aright,</HI> just as you most approved, at the Time when the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> made you d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e
<PB N="30" REF="002908_0018_0FE693A62C127C68"/>the <HI>Salvation of GOD.</HI> Some in the Time of the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> are for getting as near to those whom they take to be <HI>Good Men</HI> as they can, professing their <HI>Choice to dy with such.</HI> But, <HI>Children,</HI> whom do you <HI>chuse to live withal?</HI> There are Points of a <HI>Good Conversation in CHRIST,</HI> which perhaps you were not fully come up to. But in the Time of the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> you thought, <HI>I will now do what I know to be my Duty.</HI> Now, with the <HI>Earth∣quakes</HI> there was that <HI>Roaring out of Zion</HI> unto you; Heb. III. 7. <HI>To Day, Oh! Hear the Voice of GOD.</HI> There can be no greater Part or Proof of Pru∣dence than This; For a Man to think, <HI>What have I left undone, that if I were now a dying I should wish to have done?</HI> And go do accordingly. And now, My Friends, Think with your selves. If you felt the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> causing your <HI>Houses</HI> to fall upon you, and crush you to <HI>Death</HI> in the Ru∣ines of them; Or, if you felt the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> cause those formidable Apertures in the Ground, which would be the <HI>Gates of Death</HI> hideously open∣ing for you; Think, <HI>What is the Duty which, I have lift undone, the Neglect whereof would now make me feel the Bitterness of Death upon me? The Religi∣on of the Closet,</HI> and, <HI>Family Religion,</HI> and, <HI>The Holy Table Religiously approach'd unto;</HI> Such as these are Points of PIETY, which <HI>Earthquakes</HI> compel the Minds of Men, to confess their Obligations to, and Chastise them for the neglecting of. If you saw your selves going down into the horrible <HI>Caverns,</HI> which <HI>Earthquakes</HI> may sink you down into, would it not exceedingly terrify you, to think, <HI>I have not this Day been on my Knees in secret before the Glorious GOD?</HI> If <HI>Earthquakes</HI> made it
<PB N="31" REF="002908_0018_0FE693A62C127C68"/>not safe that you should stay in your <HI>Habitations,</HI> and yet made you at a loss where to be safe by running out of them, would it not exceedingly terrify you to think, that you had never, or seldom, or poorly called upon GOD in your <HI>Habitations?</HI> There is the Duty of Commemorating the <HI>Death</HI> of our SAVIOUR at His <HI>Holy Table,</HI> whereof the precept is as plain as any words can make it; <HI>THIS DO!</HI> For the Epidemical Neglect of this Duty, the usual <HI>Apology</HI> is a very wicked one. 'Tis, <HI>I have not prepared for it!</HI> Man, The very <HI>Apology</HI> is it self an <HI>Impiety.</HI> 'Tis thy <HI>Crime,</HI> that thou art not <HI>prepared.</HI> It is pleaded; <HI>It is not in me, I can't prepare my self.</HI> But, Hast thou done all that is <HI>in Thee,</HI> and as much as <HI>Thou canst,</HI> that thou mayst be <HI>prepared?</HI> The Neglect of this Duty is always a <HI>Grief of Mind</HI> on a <HI>Death-bed,</HI> unto such as are not <HI>Hardened in their Sins.</HI> It must needs be a <HI>Grief of Mind</HI> in an <HI>Earthquake.</HI> 'Twil then be a Disconsolate Reflection: <HI>There is one Thing, wherein I have disobey'd, and have dishonoured my SAVIOUR all my Days. Not prepar'd,</HI> you say! But suppose it could be told you, <HI>Before this Month is out, a formi∣dable Earthquake shall put a stop to your Breathing on the Face of the Earth any more!</HI> What would you do to <HI>prepare</HI> for it? With <HI>Madness in your Hearts</HI> you are <HI>going down to the Dead,</HI> if you do not now Im∣mediately, all that were Necessary to be done that you may <HI>prepare</HI> for This. Now <HI>prepare to meet with</HI> your own <HI>Death,</HI> as you are given up to a <HI>Reprobats Mind</HI> if you do it not, and you will <HI>prepare</HI> to <HI>shew forth</HI> your Lord's <HI>Death</HI> at His <HI>Holy Table</HI> as you ought to do. The jogs of the <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> have been as <HI>Goads</HI> upon you, for stimulating of you to
<PB N="32" REF="002908_0019_0FE693A64EE06538"/>your Duty. Methinks, you may hear your SAVI∣OUR from the <HI>Earth</HI> calling to you, as once from <HI>Heaven</HI> to another; <HI>Soul, Soul, Why dost thou keep at a distance from me? It is hard for thee, and it cannot be safe, to Rick against the Goads.</HI></P>
<P>When <HI>Rahab</HI> joined her self to the Church of <HI>Is∣rael,</HI> she had a <HI>Scarlet-Cord</HI> given her, and something to show for her preservation, when an <HI>Earthquake</HI> threw down the Walls of <HI>Jericho.</HI> Truly, To come with the <HI>preparation of the Sanctuary,</HI> and join your selves to an Instituted Church of the GOD of <HI>Israel,</HI> and so to <HI>dwell in His Tabernacle,</HI> 'tis to <HI>seek a Refuge under the covert of His Wings.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. The <HI>purposes</HI> of PIETY which you take up from the <HI>Terrors of the shadow of Death</HI> in the <HI>Earth∣quakes,</HI> let the <HI>Covenant of Grace</HI> give <HI>life</HI> unto them: And with the Spirit of that <HI>New Covenant</HI> proceed unto the <HI>performing</HI> of what you have <HI>purposed.</HI> The <HI>Good Impressions</HI> made by the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> do shoot forth First, in <HI>Good purposes</HI> to <HI>walk according to that Rule,</HI> which brings <HI>Peace</HI> to the <HI>Israel of GOD.</HI> The <HI>Good Impressions</HI> are lost, when those <HI>Good purposes</HI> fail of being Executed. And they will fail if you keep up the Spirit of the <HI>Old Covenant,</HI> when you set about the Execution of them. The First Thing you must see to, is, That your <HI>Good purposes</HI> be not made in your <HI>own strength:</HI> Or with an Imagina∣tion of your being Able to <HI>will and to do at your own pleasure;</HI> If they be so, there will be no <HI>strength</HI> in them. The <HI>Adversaries of the Lord,</HI> and of <HI>Good pur∣poses</HI> to walk with Him, O Man, By thy <HI>own strength,</HI> never, never shalt thou <HI>prevail</HI> against them. Under the Horrors of the <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> you <HI>purpose</HI> to express a <HI>Respect unto</HI> these and those, and
<PB N="33" REF="002908_0019_0FE693A64EE06538"/>even <HI>All the Commandments of GOD.</HI> You Trust you shall <HI>do</HI> as you <HI>say;</HI> never <HI>do</HI> as you have <HI>done.</HI> You have no <HI>Fear</HI> of it. But, <HI>I have!</HI> — In whom do you <HI>Trust?</HI> In thy <HI>own Heart,</HI> O Vain Man! Then thou art a <HI>Fool.</HI> All will soon come to No∣thing. There is a Clause of more than ordinary Significancy, which must be an Ingredient of all <HI>Good Purposes;</HI> Even That; Phil. IV. 13. <HI>THRO' CHRIST WHO STRENGTHENS ME.</HI> The <HI>Cove∣nant of Works,</HI> the Frame and Strain of <HI>That,</HI> will choak all <HI>Good Purposes,</HI> and kill them in the Bud. The <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> is that which alone will Preserve them, Secure them, Nourish them. And you are thus to conceive of it. There is an Eter∣nal COVENANT between GOD the FATHER, and GOD our SAVIOUR. In that <HI>Covenant of Redemption,</HI> your SAVIOUR promised, not only that He will pay the <HI>Price of Redemption</HI> for you, <HI>[which has been done!]</HI> but also, that He will <HI>Quicken</HI> and <HI>Incline</HI> and <HI>Strengthen</HI> the People, whom He brings under the <HI>Shadow of His Wings,</HI> to Glorify GOD, and Live unto Him. Your <HI>Good Purposes</HI> are best expressed in the Form of giving the <HI>Consent</HI> of your Souls, that the Blessed JESUS, who is your <HI>Saviour</HI> and <HI>Surety,</HI> should <HI>Assist</HI> you unto the Doing of all the Good, which you <HI>Purpose</HI> to do. I freely own to you, that I am not entirely satisfied in a <HI>Form of Covenanting with GOD,</HI> wherein we act our selves as <HI>Princi∣pals,</HI> and a Glorious CHRIST is brought in only as an <HI>Accessary.</HI> Tho' <HI>an exceeding great Multitude which no Man can Number,</HI> have been brought home to GOD in that <HI>Form,</HI> yet, I judge, the more <HI>Evargelical</HI> the <HI>Form</HI> is, and the more that
<PB N="34" REF="002908_0020_0FE693BA64D9C2F8"/>CHRIST is <HI>All</HI> in it, it is the Better, and the <HI>Surer,</HI> and the <HI>Faster.</HI> The Style of your <HI>Good Purposes</HI> is to be such as This; <Q>O Great GOD, Be Thou <HI>my GOD.</HI> I am not able to pay unto Thee the Homage of PIETY, in the Duties of it, which I owe unto Thee. But, I Desire, I Desire to do it; I desire to do these <HI>Duties.</HI> My Blessed JESUS has engaged that His People shall, thro' Him acting as a <HI>Principle of Life</HI> in them, do these <HI>Duties;</HI> And it is my Desire to be comprehended in this Engagement, and be <HI>Found in Him.</HI> I Consent, I Consent, That He should cause me to do them; and <HI>work in me all that is well-pleasing in the sight of GOD.</HI> I put my self under His Conduct, that He may do so. And even in my giving this <HI>Consent,</HI> it is His Help that has brought me to it.—</Q> Now, O <HI>Evangelized</HI> Soul, <HI>Go on, and prosper.</HI></P>
<P>But, Oh! Remember at the same time, to lay aside all Thoughts of going to <HI>Establish your own Righteousness,</HI> or of making to your selves a <HI>Righ∣teousness</HI> of your own <HI>Obedience,</HI> to the Command∣ments of GOD; No, Tho' it should be in the <HI>Evangelical Way</HI> carried on. You must propose to stand <HI>Justified</HI> before the <HI>Thrice-Holy</HI> GOD, only in the <HI>Righteousness</HI> of that <HI>Obedience,</HI> which the Blessed JESUS yielded unto His <HI>Law</HI> for you. And you must not so much as Propose to be <HI>Re∣commended,</HI> unto the Liberty and Priviledge of pleading that spotless <HI>Righteousness,</HI> by your own <HI>Obedience,</HI> or by your <HI>Good Purposes</HI> of it: But come to it with no <HI>Recommendation,</HI> but the Cha∣racter of the <HI>Poor</HI> that must make This their <HI>only Refuge.</HI> If you take up <HI>Good Purposes,</HI> with the
<PB N="35" REF="002908_0020_0FE693BA64D9C2F8"/><HI>Indirect Views</HI> of a <HI>Self-Justiciary,</HI> they will all soon <HI>die</HI> away, and be laid under that Epitaph, <HI>My Purposes are broken off, even the Thoughts of my Heart.</HI></P>
<P>It will be well for you, if you fall into the hands of <HI>Skilful Divines,</HI> and <HI>Pastors</HI> that will wisely <HI>lead</HI> you <HI>in the Paths of Righteousness.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. Allow me to Conclude with one brief Di∣rection, which I tender as an <HI>Appendix</HI> to the rest. There is a <HI>Stratagem</HI> of your <HI>Adversary the Devil,</HI> which you are to be warned of.</P>
<P>In the <HI>Concern of Mind,</HI> which the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> raise in you, be not so concerned about <HI>lesser,</HI> and perhaps <HI>doubtful Matters,</HI> as to overlook the more <HI>Weighty matters of the Gospel.</HI> The <HI>Good Impressions</HI> from the <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> may be much damnified, by being diverted from the MAIN THINGS that are called for; Or, by Exclamations against the <HI>lesser Faults</HI> in <HI>others,</HI> putting by and shifting off, the Charge of much <HI>Greater</HI> in <HI>our selves.</HI> There may be the fine-spun <HI>Devices of Satan,</HI> in a Pre∣posterous and an Irregular, and a Self-Opiniona∣ted <HI>Zeal;</HI> And we should not be <HI>Ignorant of His Devices.</HI></P>
<P>As for <HI>Garments,</HI> by all means, let all <HI>Exorbitances</HI> and <HI>Extravagances</HI> be rebuked, and retrenched; All Trespasses against the <HI>Modest,</HI> and <HI>Shamefac'd,</HI> and <HI>Sober Apparrel,</HI> which the <HI>Word of GOD</HI> requires, be Redressed. GOD, as well as Good and Wise Christians, is displeased at them. Yea, 'tis now a proper season to make Humble <HI>Abatements,</HI> even of some lawful <HI>Ornaments.</HI> For the rest, let us keep to the <HI>Word of GOD,</HI> and moderately use, <HI>every Creature,</HI> which He has there granted us a
<PB N="36" REF="002908_0021_0FE693BA837AA000"/><HI>Charter</HI> for: And not fall into the <HI>Arrogant Pride</HI> of making Things to be <HI>Sins,</HI> which the <HI>Word of GOD</HI> has never made so: [But may be as lawful as for a Man to wear an <HI>Hat</HI> of <HI>Beevers Fur,</HI> or a <HI>Ca<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> of <HI>Sheeps wool</HI> upon his Head.] Nor let us lay the <HI>Main stress</HI> of our Demands, on Things, which the <HI>worst</HI> People in the World, can as easily come to as the <HI>Best.</HI> But while we are <HI>zealously affected,</HI> as it is a <HI>Good Thing</HI> to be, against the <HI>Vanity</HI> and <HI>Luxury</HI> of a few <HI>Foolish People</HI> in their <HI>Garb,</HI> and the like, let us be <HI>Proportionably zealous</HI> against those <HI>grosser</HI> efforts of <HI>Ungodliness</HI> and <HI>Unrighteousness,</HI> which have the <HI>Wrath of GOD reveled from Heaven</HI> against them. And let our <HI>Main care</HI> be for, a SOUL so full of <HI>submission</HI> to GOD, a SOUL so full of <HI>Con∣formity</HI> to CHRIST, a SOUL so full of <HI>Benignity</HI> to <HI>Men,</HI> as the Gospel calls for. This is what all Wise Men are <HI>agreed in.</HI> While there may be those, who may see <HI>False causes of Punishment,</HI> and may <HI>enquire not wisely</HI> upon them.</P>
<P>If we will be Nice at <HI>straining of Gnats,</HI> I beseech you, let it be <HI>Enquir'd,</HI> [Not as if <HI>That</HI> were one!] What is to be thought about the <HI>Cry of DEFRAU∣DED LABOURERS going up to the Lord of Sabaoth.</HI></P>
<P>Yea, if Things not yet by all Good Men <HI>Agreed on,</HI> may be spoken of, let it be Enquired, Whether Christians do generally pay to a glorious CHRIST, the <HI>Dues</HI> which they that would count themselves, the True Sons of <HI>Abraham,</HI> should be induced ea∣sily to Confess, belonging to our <HI>Melchizedek?</HI> And whether they Devote unto PIOUS USES, that <HI>portion</HI> of their <HI>Income,</HI> which the <HI>pattern</HI> of our Father <HI>Jacob,</HI> and the <HI>precept</HI> of the Gospel, has plainly declared for? And whether the SON of
<PB N="37" REF="002908_0021_0FE693BA837AA000"/>GOD, be not <HI>Robb'd,</HI> as in a <HI>Sacriledge,</HI> when this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortion</HI> is witheld from Him? And whether if this <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ortion</HI> were <HI>honestly paid</HI> unto the LORD, a very <HI>small Morety</HI> of it applied where it should be, would not put a stop to the Cry of many DEFRAU∣DED LABOURERS? But it seems, this is, Not <HI>Agreed</HI> on. And I know very well, what I say of this matter will be little regarded; But see, whe∣ther a perpetual <HI>Series</HI> and <HI>Succession</HI> of <HI>Impoverish∣ments,</HI> and <HI>Remarkable ways devised</HI> by the Justice of Heaven for it, be not what our Land will be doom'd unto. — I have done. Behold the Me∣thod for preventing of an <HI>Abortion</HI> on our <HI>Good Im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ressions,</HI> and this unhappy Account of them, <HI>We have been in pain, we have brought forth wind, we have not wrought any Deliverance for the Soul that has been going with us.</HI></P>
<P>I come to the <HI>Conclusion of the Matter.</HI> It may be hoped, The <HI>Good Impressions</HI> from our <HI>Earth∣quakes,</HI> will be such, that the <HI>Trembling</HI> of the <HI>Earth</HI> under us, will prove the most <HI>useful Dispensation</HI> of Heaven, that ever we have met with<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>l. Many <HI>Children</HI> of GOD, will Bless Him to Eternal Ages, for the <HI>Excitations</HI> which the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> have given into the PIETY which was too languid in them. And many <HI>Elect</HI> of GOD who were not yet His <HI>Children,</HI> are made such, by the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> driving of them, into those Motions of PIETY, which carry them to their SAVIOUR. The <HI>Lord of Hosts</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oming to <HI>shake the Earth,</HI> hereupon the <HI>Desire of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ll Nations has come,</HI> and <HI>fill'd</HI> their Hearts with <HI>his Glory.</HI> As we read, <HI>The Voice of the Eternal GOD makes the Hinds to bring forth;</HI> By the start∣ing Roars of the <HI>Thunders</HI> over them, when
<PB N="38" REF="002908_0022_0FE693BE7828D0D8"/>they are <HI>Travailing,</HI> they are thrown into <HI>Frights</HI> that force their Off-spring from them: So the <HI>Voice</HI> of the Eternal GOD, in the ghastly Roars of the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> under us, will cause many a Soul to be <HI>New Born;</HI> and many Slow, Dull Dilatory <HI>Intentions</HI> of Doing the Will of GOD will be <HI>brought forth</HI> into <HI>Endeavours</HI> that never will be repented of. The Churches in the Ca∣pital City of the Province, and many other Chur∣ches throughout the Countrey, have set apart Whole DAYS of <HI>Supplications</HI> to Obtain the Bles∣sings of a <HI>Successful Gospel.</HI> We have stood wait∣ing for some while, and wondring what was be∣come of our <HI>Prayers.</HI> The <HI>Success</HI> was not pre∣sently what we look'd for. We did not present∣ly see the <HI>Answers</HI> of our <HI>Prayers.</HI> But, Lo, as we read of the Primitive Beleevers, <HI>When they had prayed, the place was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.</HI> Even thus, the Glorious GOD <HI>shakes</HI> the <HI>place</HI> where these <HI>Prayers</HI> are made, and grants those Effusions of the <HI>Holy Spi∣rit</HI> for which we made our <HI>Prayers.</HI> Yea, <HI>By Ter∣rible Things in Righteousness</HI> He <HI>answers</HI> us, as the <HI>GOD of our Salvation,</HI> and grants us the <HI>Petitions we have desired of Him.</HI> O Wonderful! O Won∣derful! Our GOD instead of sending <HI>Earthquakes</HI> to destroy as He justly might, He sends them to fetch us home unto Himself, and to do us the greatest Good in the World! If these <HI>Good Impres∣sions</HI> grow, and hold, and last, and come to a due Maturity, it looks as if some <HI>Salvation</HI> may be nigh to us, and <HI>Glory</HI> may <HI>dwell in our Land.</HI></P>
<P>What a Deplorable Thing is it, That some of our <HI>Congregations</HI> have such Contentions and Con∣fusions
<PB N="39" REF="002908_0022_0FE693BE7828D0D8"/>in them, as greatly to defeat such an En∣joyment and such an Improvement of <HI>Good Im∣pressions</HI> as others are exceedingly Rejoicing in O <HI>Lord JESUS, pity them!</HI></P>
<P>On the other hand; A <HI>Relapse</HI> is always dange∣rous. If the <HI>Good Impressions</HI> on the Minds of People from the <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> quickly vanish, and People become generally as <HI>Worldly,</HI> and as <HI>Prayerless,</HI> and as <HI>Vitious,</HI> as before the <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> and if the <HI>Good∣ness</HI> whereof there is a show made on the <HI>Earth∣quakes,</HI> do <HI>go away</HI> with them, we may <HI>Tremble,</HI> we may <HI>Tremble,</HI> at, <HI>what is a coming!</HI> They who <HI>dwell in the Wilderness</HI> have cause to be <HI>afraid of the Tokens.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Miserables themselves, it looks aw∣fully, as if it must be said, <HI>All is in vain; They are a Reprobate Metal; the Lord has Rejected them.</HI> It looks awfully, as if this were the <HI>Doom</HI> from GOD upon them, <HI>Never, Never shall any Fruit be found upon them;</HI> and as if the <HI>Oath</HI> of GOD were gone out against them, <HI>That they shall never enter into His Rest.</HI> There seems to be that sentence from the Mouth of GOD upon these Obdurate Sinners; Ezek. XXIV. 13. <HI>Because I have purged thee, and thou wast not purged, thou shalt not be purged any more, till I have caused my Fury to rest upon thee.</HI> That there should be <HI>Earth∣quakes</HI> extending for more than Five Hundred Miles; and in several places the <HI>Roars</HI> continue every Day for some Weeks together, and the <HI>shocks</HI> be given many <HI>sevens</HI> of times in these Weeks; and not <HI>one life</HI> be lost in all! — <HI>O the Goodness and Forbearance, and Long-suffering</HI> of our GOD! But if this be trifled with, what a <HI>Wrath,</HI> O Hardened ones, what a <HI>Wrath,</HI> are you <HI>treasuring up against the Day of Wrath!</HI> It will be well, if something of a
<PB N="40" REF="002908_0023_0FE693BE9C810328"/><HI>Pestilential Aspect</HI> be not quickly shot among us, wherein the <HI>slain of the Lord way be many.</HI> — I say, something of a <HI>Pestilential Aspect.</HI> Our LORD ha∣ving spoken of, <HI>Earthquakes in diverse places,</HI> pre∣sently proceeds to speak of, <HI>Pestilences.</HI> Upon the amazing <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> wherein the mighty City of <HI>Antioch,</HI> with many other places was demolished, before our Apostle <HI>John</HI> could be well cold in his Grave, which, I suppose, our Lord in His Praedic∣tion had His Eye first upon, there came on such a <HI>Pestilence</HI> that it look'd as if the World was going to be dis-peopled; and the Reliques of it remained even to the Time of the Martyr <HI>Cyprian.</HI> When there had been an <HI>Earthquake</HI> in the Wilderness, where the People assoon as they Recovered out of the Cries into which it had thrown them, disco∣vered an <HI>Incurable Obstinacy</HI> in their Vile Tempers, and their Base Doings, the <HI>Next News</HI> is, A <HI>Pesti∣lence,</HI> which destroy'd many Thousands of them. After the never-to-be-forgotten <HI>Earthquake</HI> in one of our well-known Islands, that some now among us were present at, Half the People saved from the perdition at <HI>Port-royal,</HI> died of a <HI>Pestilence</HI> at <HI>King∣ston;</HI> where five hundred Graves were dug within a Month, and sometimes Two or Three buried in one Hole together; And the rest of the Island had a deep Draught in that <HI>Cup of Astonishment</HI> which GOD gave them after He had caused the <HI>Earth</HI> to <HI>Tremble</HI> under them. Indeed, the Exemples of Mi∣neral and Malignant Steams, from <HI>Earthquakes</HI> ter∣minating in a raging <HI>Pestilence,</HI> have been very Usual and very Dismal. Yea, <HI>American</HI> Exem∣ples of such a thing. Tho' the proper <HI>Plague</HI> was never known in <HI>America;</HI> it is well known,
<PB N="41" REF="002908_0023_0FE693BE9C810328"/>that after some <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> which overturned al∣most the whole Capital City of <HI>Chili,</HI> in the <HI>South-America,</HI> not very many Years ago, almost all the surviving Inh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>itants died of a <HI>Pestilence,</HI> more Mortal than a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>oper <HI>Plague</HI> use to be. We are not certain, that our <HI>Earthquakes</HI> will have a∣ny such Effects. The <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> portunity, to
Methods of <HI>Repentance</HI> may prevent them. Our Flight unto our SAVIOUR with the Faith of the XCI. Psalm; This may save us from them. Yet, In Conformity to what our SAVIOUR spoke of some Tragical Acci∣dents which had happened a little before, where∣of one seems to have been an <HI>Earthquake,</HI>— <HI>Ex∣cept ye Repent,</HI>—I will venture to say, I verily Fear, That the Glorious GOD, having within a little while singled out several Towns, that were <HI>None of the Worst,</HI> [Not <HI>Sinners above all Men!</HI>] but full of Godly People, and ordered the <HI>Destroying Angel</HI> to make a <HI>Doleful Havock</HI> among them, He has therein shot off <HI>Direful Warning-pieces</HI> to all the Land: I say, <HI>Direful Warning-pieces!</HI>— And His Voice to the whole Countrey, is, O! <HI>Let there be a General Turn to GOD, in a Life of Serious PI∣ETY, lest a more General Stroke do make fearful De∣vastations upon you!</HI></P>
<P>I do not speak these things, as a <HI>Melancholy Vi∣sionary,</HI> or because of any <HI>Delight</HI> I can take in keeping my Neighbours under a <HI>Fear</HI> which has <HI>Torment</HI> in it. And indeed I am sorry to see, that ever now and then, upon some Idle Rumours and Whimseys, the <HI>Heart of this People is moved, as the Trees of the Wood are moved with the Wind;</HI> More <HI>moved,</HI> alas, than they are by the <HI>plain Word</HI> of GOD brought unto them: Sorry, sorry, to
<PB N="42" REF="002908_0024_0FE693C987285238"/>see, That <HI>foolish Notions</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>yer now and then started by the Devil, to torture as, and to triumph over our Guilty Souls, will work more upon us, than all the plain Commination of that Word, where∣in we have the Glorious GOD <HI>marvellously Thun∣dering</HI> over us! No, But <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ying the Terror of the Lord,</HI> we would <HI>perswade</HI> you, unto that PIETY, which may divert the Judgments of GOD, that may be hanging over us. And we would have you <HI>sing in the ways</HI> of that PIETY; fain have you <HI>Live Comfortably,</HI> and be bravely above the <HI>Fear of Evil.</HI> You know the Course that <HI>Ninive</HI> took, and how it succeeded. What? Shall a <HI>New-England</HI> be worse than a <HI>Ni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve?</HI> GOD forbid! Syrs, They whom <HI>Earthquakes</HI> do chase into a Life of PIETY, do the best Thing that can be done, to procure a <HI>Marke</HI> of GOD upon them, for their Preservation, if He should send an <HI>Over∣flowing Scourge,</HI> and pour out the <HI>Vials</HI> of His Wrath on the <HI>Children of Disobedience,</HI> and of <HI>Un∣perswadeableness.</HI> O Beleevers, Thus taken under the Protection of your SAVIOUR, Hear Him now saying unto you, <HI>Fear not, for I am with thee: Be not dismayed, for I am thy GOD.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>Lifting up a Voice like a Trumpet,</HI> I declare unto you that are <HI>Impenitent</HI> under and after such <HI>Earthquakes</HI> as have come to rowse us from the <HI>Dead sleep</HI> upon us, <HI>Earthquakes</HI> are not all the <HI>Ar∣rows,</HI> in the <HI>Quiver</HI> of GOD, <HI>ordained</HI> for those, by whom He is <HI>proveked every day.</HI> But if <HI>Earthquake;</HI> will not move you, it seems come to a, <HI>Conclama∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>um est.</HI>— Alass,— It looks as if the last Mean; were used; and all that remains were only this; <HI>He that being often Reproved, hardens his Neck, shall be lestroyed suddenly, and without any Remedy.</HI> Yea.</P>

We are told, It must be at and for the De∣struction of that <HI>Roman Monarchy,</HI> for which the last Period of <HI>Twelve Hundred and Sixty Years</HI> are most certainly upon their Expiration. An Excel∣lent Pen, which <HI>New-England</HI> will have Singular cause to know, has in an Incomparable Treatise on the <HI>Sacred Prophecies,</HI> with much Erudition shown, and with much Demonstration prov'd, That there is abundance of cause to think, the Expiration of that <HI>Black Period</HI> may have been a∣bove Ten Years ago.

<P>History gives us the Names of some Philosophers among the ancient <HI>Pagans,</HI> who upon some Circumstances observed in the bottom of <HI>Wells,</HI> and some other such Occurrences, foretold <HI>Earthquakes;</HI> which came to pass accordingly.

<HEAD>An APPENDIX. Written Dec. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. 1727. A Collection Of some Observable Occurrences, Which the present <HI>Earthquakes</HI> of NEW-ENGLAND, [The <HI>Shocks</HI> and <HI>Roars</HI> whereof, we had no lon∣ger ago than the Last Night awakening of us,] Lead us to take Notice of.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I. The First OBSERVABLE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Occurring of EARTHQUAKES in DIVERS PLACES, is what our SAVI∣OUR has advised us to consider of. Truly, In <HI>this Year</HI> of NEW-ENGLAND's <HI>Trembling,</HI> there are occurring EARTHQUAKES in DIVERS PLACES. If the jogs given to <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Britain,</HI> do little to rowse the <HI>Europaean</HI> World from the Lethargy of the <HI>last Time,</HI> yet it may be hoped some in <HI>America</HI> may <HI>hear Attentively the Noise of the Voice of GOD</HI> in them, and the <HI>Sound that goes out of His Mouth.</HI></P>
<P>In our coming to relate the <HI>Earthquakes</HI> of <HI>this Year,</HI> it may not be amiss, but be a decent Introducti∣on, to relate, that so lately, as a little above a Year
<PB N="47" REF="002908_0026_0FE693CDDE6664F8"/>ago, in the Night between the first and second of <HI>September,</HI> between the Hours of Ten and Eleven, the City of <HI>Palermo</HI> in <HI>Sicily,</HI> felt some shocks, of an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> which were not at first very Vio∣lent. But they soon increased with great Fury for above Twenty Minutes; whereby about a quarter part of that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>reat City, was overturn'd &amp; overwhelm'd, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ade an Heap of amazing Rubbish: From whence <HI>Three Thousand of the Dead,</HI> were draw out, five days after, fearfully crush'd and mash'd, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>erably broken to pieces. In one Ward of the City, a whole <HI>Street</HI> gaped at once with an hideous and horrid Noise; and from the Chasm, there issued out <HI>Flames,</HI> which were mixed with calcined Stones, and a Torrent of <HI>Burning Brimstone,</HI> whereby in less than half an Hour, the whole Waid was consumed. It was computed, that about <HI>Fifteen Thousand</HI> People pe∣rished in this Desolation. But <HI>This Year</HI> is what we are now confin'd unto. We are informed that in the Month of <HI>May</HI> last, they had several Shocks of an <HI>Earthquake,</HI> at <HI>Arles,</HI> in <HI>France;</HI> and one so Violent, that all the Inhabitants ran out of the City, for fear of being overwhelmed under the Ruines of their Houses, and continued en∣camped in the open Countrey, till they hoped the Danger was over. Some of the Shocks were more Violent about <HI>Languedoc,</HI> than at <HI>Arles.</HI></P>
<P>Our Accounts from <HI>Great Britain,</HI> inform us, That on the Nineteenth of <HI>July</HI> last, there were <HI>Earthquakes</HI> felt at <HI>Swanzy,</HI> before which there was heard a mighty Noise, like that of <HI>Thunder</HI> at a Distance. The Houses trembled; The Walls of Gardens rocqued; The tops of Chimneys fell;
<PB N="48" REF="002908_0027_0FE693CE00AA3250"/>Many lest their Habitan<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> — At the same time they felt the like at <HI>Hig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>worth,</HI> &amp; the Neigh∣bouring places, where the People were thrown into the greatest Consternation, from the Appre∣hension of their Houses falling upon them. An Alteration in the Face of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ky, and the Co∣lour and Quivering of the I<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>inaries there, be∣fore it, was very much ob<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed. At the same time the City of <HI>Bristol</HI> had <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> share of the Con∣sternation.</P>
<P>About <HI>Exeter,</HI> they had the <HI>Earthquake</HI> which gave dreadful Concussions; People could not stand when they felt it; It rang the Bells in the Sceeples; And some Damage was done by it. From several other parts in the <HI>West,</HI> there have come in the like Accounts.</P>
<P>The Relation from <HI>Wa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s,</HI> is yet more Expres∣sive. <Q>On <HI>Wednesday</HI> the <HI>Nineteenth</HI> of <HI>July,</HI> a lit∣tle after Four in the Morning, we had a most terrible <HI>Earthquake.</HI> They that were in the Field, and heard it coming (as they say, from the <HI>East,</HI>) could not tell what to liken it to, but to Great Guns, firing under Ground, or some terrible Thunder. The Hedges and Trees seemed to walk, or move from their Places; The Birds flew out from thence, as if they were frighted; The Walls of the Park and Gardens [at <HI>Margam</HI>] were shook down; The Doors of the Church, and of several Houses flew open, tho' Lock'd and Bolted. The Bells tolled of themselves; se∣veral Stacks of Chimneys were thrown down. Houses untiled; Windows and Shutters broken. The Milk-People in the Fields, declare, That the Earth trembled so, that the Milk dash'd o∣ver
<PB REF="002908_0027_0FE693CE00AA3250"/>the Edges of the Pails. The Rivers swelled several times higher than was usual, and the Water changed unto the Colour of Whey. The Houses and Beds rocqued like Cradles.</Q></P>
<P>Besides these Things; on Aug. 25. In the Vale of <HI>Good-Cheap,</HI> adjoining to the Parishes of <HI>Wye</HI> and <HI>Hinxhil,</HI> several Brooks were on Fire for ma∣ny Days together; which People were, as well they might be, very much surprized at.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="2" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>The Second OBSERVABLE.</HEAD>
<P>We soon knew, that our EARTHQUAKE ex∣tended more than <HI>Five Hundred Miles.</HI> But shall we reckon it a part of <HI>ours,</HI> if we find an EARTH∣QUAKE within a Day or Two before <HI>ours</HI> affect∣ing the <HI>Caribbee-Islands?</HI> Reader, Consider what we are going to Relate, and think, with a just Reflection, How deep the <HI>Fires</HI> may ly, which may give so near <HI>Simultaneous Agitations,</HI> to the Tottering Arch which is our only <HI>Foundation;</HI> [if we have no share in the <HI>City</HI> that has better <HI>Foun∣dations!</HI>] and what a mighty Force they may a∣non exert upon it!</P>
<P>We have Advice, that the <HI>Earthquake</HI> we had here; (if it may be said so) Oct. 29. between Ten and Eleven in the Evening, was felt at <HI>Barbados</HI> the Day before, about <HI>Noon;</HI> which is near <HI>two Thousand Miles</HI> distant from us; And much after the manner we had it here. The <HI>Houses</HI> were in a very frightful Convulsion; The <HI>Streets</HI> rose and fell, even like the <HI>Waves</HI> of the Sea; The People in utmost Consternation from an Apprehension that the Earth might sink under them, ran to the Wharfe, that they might get into Vessels for their safety.</P>
<P><PB REF="002908_0028_0FE693D8DD03C3D0"/>
We have Advice also, that <HI>Martineco,</HI> A Day or two before the Time of our <HI>Earthquake,</HI> underwent a more terrible one than that of <HI>Bar∣bados,</HI> or, that of <HI>New-England.</HI> Their <HI>Temple</HI> and their <HI>Prison</HI> were thrown down; and many of their <HI>Sugar-works</HI> ruined; and their Negros kill'd. The <HI>Noise</HI> as well as the <HI>Shock,</HI> was beyond Ex∣pression hideous; They that have arrived from thence unto us, discover an <HI>Abiding Horror,</HI> at what they heard and felt and saw, in what they are escaped from.</P>
<P>It may be added, That some of our Vessels, which were at a considerable Distance from us, in the midst of the <HI>Huge</HI> and <HI>Wide Atlantic,</HI> at the Time of our <HI>Earthquake</HI> were <HI>visited</HI> with such <HI>Thunder,</HI> as they had scarce ever known to be pa∣rallel'd.</P>

<HEAD>III. The Third OBSERVABLE.</HEAD>
<P>There was <HI>This Year,</HI> a very strange occurrence in <HI>Ireland;</HI> which drew as in <HI>Miniature</HI> a most <HI>lively Emblem,</HI> of what it is that EARTH∣QUAKES come for; and of the Condition and Confusion which falls upon <HI>Forsaken Sinners,</HI> when held in the <HI>Cords</HI> of their <HI>Sins,</HI> and fiez'd by the Ir∣resistible Vengeance of Heaven. The Story is worth telling; and by the ordering of GOD it is come to pass, that it is told among the Nations; Yea, and in <HI>America</HI> too this <HI>lively Picture</HI> is now exhibited. Here it is; look upon it!</P>
<P>On the Fourteenth of the last <HI>August,</HI> (1727.) as one <HI>John Byrn,</HI> a Wretch of a very Dissolute and Abandoned Life, stood at the Gallows in <HI>Kilkenny,</HI> with a Rope about his Neck, in order to be executed for the Murder of one Mr. <HI>Taylor,</HI>
<PB REF="002908_0028_0FE693D8DD03C3D0"/>and was relating the Murder with an amazin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Indolence and Insolence, a Noise like <HI>Thunder</HI> was heard under the Gallows, and the <HI>Earth fell a Trembling,</HI> with the terrible Shocks of an <HI>Earth∣quake,</HI> for many Yards round about the Place, but not extending any further.

<P>About Eight o'Clock, in the Evening that fol∣lowed the Ninth of <HI>September,</HI> 1727 at a place called <HI>Barwel,</HI> in <HI>Cambridge-shire,</HI> (about Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>les from <HI>New-Market</HI>) there was a <HI>Popp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>-Show</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>cting<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>in a Barn, which was built with <HI>Barwe. Stone</HI> and thatch'd with <HI>Straw.</HI> The Man going to give his Attendents the sight of the Show, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> only <HI>Lock'd</HI> but also <HI>Nail'd,</HI> the Door. There was a Place adjoining to the Barn, which had in it a
<PB REF="002908_0030_0FE693DE1FA60148"/>Quantity of <HI>Hay</HI> and <HI>Straw;</HI> and a Boy who set a Wooden Lanthorn with a short Candle down, while he peep'd in to see the Spectacle. A Man, who had threatened, that if he were not let in to see it for nothing, he would set the Barn on <HI>Fire</HI> over their Heads, beat the Lanthorn about, so as to set the <HI>Hay</HI> and <HI>Straw</HI> on <HI>Fire,</HI> and ran away. The Flaming <HI>Hay</HI> and <HI>Straw</HI> presently set the <HI>Barn</HI> on a <HI>Flame;</HI> which had a Floor above the Peo∣ple; and the <HI>Fire</HI> getting into the <HI>False Roof,</HI> ran like Wild-fire; and the falling of the Floor has∣tened the Death, of the smothered Miserables. The People could not get out; but about Five or Six escaped the <HI>Flames;</HI> The rest, which were about <HI>One Hundred and Twenty,</HI> among whom there were several <HI>Young Gentlewomen</HI> of conside∣rable Estates, miserably perished. Some had their <HI>Legs</HI> burnt off, some their <HI>Hands,</HI> and some their <HI>Heads;</HI> and some were intirely incinerated. The <HI>Merry-Andrew</HI> that belonged unto the Show, got out, but so horribly burnt, that he lived no more than a Day and a Night. It was for some little while the melancholy Employment of the Neigh∣bouring-place, to see whether they could not pick out the Roasted and Mangled Carcasses of their <HI>Particular Friends;</HI> but most of them were carried in Carts, and put into an Hole in the Church∣yard. And about Seven or Eight Houses of the Neighbourhood, were consumed in the same Disaster.</P>
