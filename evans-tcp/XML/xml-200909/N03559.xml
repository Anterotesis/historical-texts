<P><SEG REND="decorInit">T</SEG>HE Words are part of that famous <HI>Story,</HI> which is related by <HI>three</HI> of the <HI>Evangelists</HI>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Matth.</HI> xii. 9. <HI>Luke</HI> vi. 6.</NOTE>, of our LORD'S merci∣ful and miraculous <HI>curing</HI> the Man that had a <HI>withered Hand.</HI> It was on the <HI>Sabbath Day,</HI> and in the <HI>Syna∣gogue,</HI> where no doubt our Lord had been preaching, and in Confirmation of his Doctrine He wro't this <HI>Miracle.</HI> Works of <HI>Charity</HI> and Mercy
<PB N="2" REF="004353_0004_100441B1997C5678"/>do very well agree with Acts of <HI>Devotion,</HI> and are a becoming Sabbath Exercise; suited to the Place and Time and Act of Worship when Occasion offers.</P>
<P>The superstitious <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Pharisees</HI> thought other∣wise; not that they had the least Shadow of a <HI>Reason</HI> for their Affectation and Pretence of a more strict and pre∣cise <HI>Sanctification</HI> of the Sabbath; but they had fondly imbib'd it as a venerable <HI>Tradition,</HI> which was not to be spoken against on any Account, nor parted with, be∣cause it gave 'em a <HI>Credit</HI> among the People, carrying a Face and <HI>Form</HI> of strict Devotion.</P>
<P>On the contrary our <HI>Lord</HI> declared both in his Doc∣trine and Practice this <HI>necessary Truth;</HI> That to <HI>do good</HI> on the Sabbath-day, as well in Acts of <HI>Mercy</HI> as those of Worship, was the proper and true Sanctification of it.</P>
<P>For this he was particularly <HI>malign'd</HI> and hated by the hypocritical <HI>Priests,</HI> Elders and <HI>Formalists</HI> of that Day; and therefore we find 'em in our <HI>Context</HI> watching Him whether he would <HI>heal</HI> this poor Man on the Sab∣bath, that they might <HI>accuse</HI> him. V. 2.</P>
<P>In to what Spite and <HI>Villany</HI> will not blind <HI>Superstition,</HI> as well as Profaness, carry Men? the most Divine and God-like Works shall be traduc'd, revil'd and persecuted.</P>
<P>The <HI>Patient</HI>'s Case was very piteous: It should have pleaded with 'em to have carry'd him to Christ, and besought Him to have Compassion on him. But on the contrary they play the <HI>Spies</HI> upon our Lord, that they might accuse him for a <HI>Breaker</HI> of the Sabbath. They doubtless <HI>hop'd</HI> in their Hearts, that Christ would not fail to <HI>heal</HI> him, but not from the least <HI>Pity</HI> to the miserable Object before them, nay from a diabolical Spirit of <HI>Re∣venge</HI> on Christ, when he had heal'd him. That which should have <HI>charm'd</HI> 'em into the highest Reverence and Love, provok'd their Rage.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="004353_0005_100449BDA535BDD8"/>
To shame 'em out of their Ignorance and Wicked∣ness, or to inform their Judgment and move their Com∣passion, our Lord bid the Man <HI>stand forth;</HI> and then <HI>reason'd</HI> the Matter with them: "<HI>Is it lawful,</HI> said He, <HI>to do good on the Sabbath-days, or to do evil? to save Life or to kill?—but they held their Peace.</HI> He put it to their <HI>Consciences,</HI> but they obstinately resisted the Light and <HI>Conviction</HI> they felt within themselves; and having nothing to say <HI>against</HI> so clear a Truth, they would however say nothing <HI>for it.</HI></P>
<P>Our <HI>Lord</HI> beheld this with great Grief and Anger; "<HI>He looked round about on 'em with Anger, being grieved for the Hardness of their Hearts.</HI> Justly was he pro∣voked at the Sin, yet kindly grieved for the Sinners. They <HI>hated</HI> him for his Goodness, and he <HI>pitied</HI> them for their horrid Impiety and Hypocrify.</P>
<P>He <HI>look'd</HI>— his Anger appear'd in his <HI>Face.</HI> His An∣ger was very just and <HI>holy,</HI> for he was angry at their <HI>Sin.</HI> He was griev'd at their <HI>Hardness,</HI> to see 'em obstinately set against Conviction. There is nothing should give us so much <HI>Grief,</HI> as to feel the Hardness of our <HI>own</HI> Hearts, and to see that of <HI>others.</HI></P>
<P>However, neither their <HI>Prejudice,</HI> and the Offence they took, nor the malicious <HI>Use</HI> they resolved to make of <HI>Christ's</HI> curing the poor Man, could <HI>hinder</HI> our Lord from doing it. It was a most known Act of Goodness, and He resolutely did it; as we read in my <HI>Text,—He said to the Man, Stretch forth thy Hand! and he stretch∣ed it out, and his Hand was restored whole as the o∣ther.</HI></P>
<P>It may seem a <HI>strange</HI> kind of Command given to the <HI>Man,</HI> for his Hand was <HI>withered:</HI> How then could he be required to <HI>stretch it out?</HI> It was not in his <HI>Power,</HI> it was a thing <HI>impossible</HI> for him to do; and it might therefore seem <HI>vain</HI> to attempt it.</P>
<P>But see the good <HI>Effect</HI> of our Lord's commanding him! <HI>Power</HI> accompanied the Precept; Power was
<PB N="4" REF="004353_0006_1004499BE8DD4208"/>given him to obey it. He <HI>tried</HI> at the Word of Christ, and found <HI>Strength</HI> put into the Arm, and out it <HI>stretch'd;</HI> yea and was <HI>restored whole</HI> as the other. The Effect was sudden and perfect, in an <HI>Instant,</HI> like the Work of GOD. He found the <HI>Cure</HI> wro't, upon his first <HI>Essay</HI> to obey. CHRIST <HI>spake and it was done!</HI> so the FATHER <HI>worketh still, and He works.</HI> The im∣potent Man <HI>tried</HI> to obey, and was <HI>enabled</HI> and re∣stored.</P>
<P>It was his <HI>right Hand,</HI> Luke vi. 6. The Hand with which he had wrought, or was to work for his <HI>Liveli∣hood,</HI> at his Trade or Calling. It is said, he was a <HI>Ma∣son</HI> or <HI>Bricklayer</HI>

The greater was the <HI>Charity</HI> the poorer the Man was, and the more he needed his right Hand to work with.</P>
<P>It was a very <HI>teaching Miracle,</HI> and is fit to be spoken of and <HI>spiritualiz'd</HI> in all the Churches of the Saints. This <HI>Day</HI> might it be <HI>verified</HI> upon <HI>Us</HI> our selves. Many a Time it has been, since our Lord's <HI>Ascention,</HI> in the <HI>Spirit,</HI> tho' not in the <HI>Letter.</HI></P>
<P>"The <HI>Cure</HI> in my <HI>Text</HI> is a <HI>lively Specimen</HI> of the greater and <HI>more happy Cures,</HI> wro't by the <HI>Grace</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of Christ on poor withered <HI>Souls,</HI> under the <HI>Preaching</HI> of his Word."</P>
<P>It is not indeed now the <HI>Sabbath-day,</HI> yet are we assembled for the solemn <HI>Worship</HI> of God; and our LORD JESUS is <HI>present</HI> in his Ordinances, and here are <HI>Souls</HI> whose Powers to what is spiritual and holy are <HI>withered;</HI> and what should they come hither for, but <HI>Healing</HI> and Recovery? and what is the <HI>Voice of Christ</HI> to them here, but this in my <HI>Text? "Stand forth,</HI> and <HI>lift up</HI> thy Heart to me, and be made <HI>whole.</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="004353_0007_100449C0D27F88E0"/>Let our Hearts answer, "<HI>Unto thee O Lord, do I lift up my Soul! O my God, I trust in Thee!</HI> Psal. xxv. 1, 2.</P>
<P>I have now, as it were, done my <HI>Sermon!</HI> this is in effect all I meant in the Choice of the Subject. And it were abundantly enough, a blessed Season to any or every One present, if <HI>Hand</HI> and <HI>Heart</HI> were stretching forth together unto God. Lam. iii 41. <HI>Let us lift up our Hearts with our Hands unto God in the Heavens.</HI> Psal. cxliii. 6 <HI>I stretch forth my Hands unto Thee, my Soul thirsteth after Thee.</HI></P>
<P>Nor are there any here present that will <HI>envy</HI> you the Benefit, nor <HI>Christ</HI> the Glory. Our <HI>Sabbaths</HI> and <HI>Lectures</HI> serve for this very thing, and this shall render 'em in our Eyes "<HI>the Holy of the Lord and Honourable.</HI> Then indeed are they <HI>sanctified</HI> to us, and sanctified by us, when Souls seek and meet their <HI>Saviour</HI> in his In∣stituted <HI>Worship,</HI> and receive a <HI>Cure</HI> from Him.</P>
<P>It may be a repining <HI>Devil</HI> may come among the <HI>Sons of God,</HI> and <HI>gnash</HI> while he beholds it and <HI>melt away;</HI> but numerous <HI>Angels</HI> of Light will rejoice, congratu∣late thee and laud thy <HI>Saviour.</HI> Luke xv. 10. <HI>I say unto you, there is Joy in the Presence of the Angels of God over one Sinner that repenteth.</HI></P>
<P>To come then to that <HI>spiritual Allusion and Applica∣tion,</HI> which I design of the <HI>blessed Story</HI> in my <HI>Text.</HI></P>
<P>I observe,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>We are by Nature as this Man with a withered Hand; labouring under a moral Weakness and Impotence, thro' the Loss of those spiritual Powers, which Man was certainly created with.</HI> By the Sin of our <HI>first Parents</HI> we have left our first State, and how are we <HI>fallen!</HI> Our Nature is corrupted, our Souls enfeebled and <HI>dis∣abled,</HI> indisposed and <HI>averse</HI> to what is holy and good. Our moral and spiritual Powers are gone from us, and as it were <HI>wither'd</HI> away.—So the <HI>Scripture</HI> represents to us our sad &amp; deplorable State, and teaches us to bewait and lament it; as <Q>having the Understanding <HI>darkned,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="004353_0008_100441BD5FA103F0"/>and being <HI>alienated</HI> from the Life of God, thro' the Ignorance that is in us:</Q>
<Q>for the <HI>natural Man</HI> re∣ceiveth not the Things of the <HI>Spirit of God,</HI> for they are Foolishness unto him, neither <HI>can</HI> he know them, <HI>because they are spiritually discerned:</HI> And because the <HI>carnal Mind is Enmity against God,</HI> is not subject to the Law of God, neither indeed <HI>can</HI> be
<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ephes.</HI> iv. 18. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 14. <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 7.</NOTE></Q>— The Representation of this <HI>moral Impotence</HI> you see is indeed a <HI>will not,</HI> rather than a <HI>cannot;</HI> but the being disabled to <HI>will</HI> that which is good is the <HI>worst</HI> kind of Inability, and the most lamentable Degree thereof. — When a Soul is therefore bro't to <HI>will,</HI> and in some Measure to <HI>do,</HI> being in part restored to his Original Inclination and Strength; it then becomes deeply <HI>sen∣sible</HI> of its Disability, and bewails it as coming altoge∣ther of its Corruption. Just as in the natural <HI>Body</HI> evil <HI>Habits</HI> and Lusts do often corrupt it, and procure the <HI>loss</HI> of Strength and Limbs; in like manner has <HI>Sin</HI> taken away the Powers of our Souls, to a dreadful De∣gree; so that we are become spiritually halt, lame, crip∣led and without Strength. The <HI>Remains</HI> of this Impo∣tence on the <HI>Regenerate</HI> themselves, are heavily felt, and groaned under by them; Rom vii. 18. <HI>For I know that in me, that is in my Flesh, dwelleth no good thing; for to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good I find not: I find then a Law, that when I would do good, evil is present with me: O wretched Man that I am! who shall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</HI> — In our <HI>natural</HI> State we are altogether <HI>destitute</HI> of any Power so much as heartily to <HI>will</HI> and desire the things that are spiritually good; and in our <HI>renewed</HI> State we have no Strength of <HI>our own</HI> to com∣mand and use, when and as we will, on one Occasion and another. <HI>We are not sufficient of our selves, to</HI> THINK <HI>any thing as of our selves."</HI> Here is a wretched <HI>Disabi∣lity</HI> indeed; a <HI>wither'd</HI> Mind and Will that cannot so much as meditate heartily and purpose, <HI>of it self,</HI> the Thing that is good. — "But this inability does not at

The <HI>diseased</HI> and miserable were <HI>wise</HI> and careful to <HI>improve</HI> their Opportunity, and lay themselves in <HI>Christ's</HI> Way, in the Days of his <HI>Ministry:</HI> They were sure of finding Him in the <HI>Synagogue</HI> on the <HI>Sabbath,</HI> and thither they came to be healed: Insomuch that some of the <HI>Rulers</HI> of the <HI>Synagogues</HI> took <HI>Offence</HI> at it; think∣ing (it may be) that these Acts of Mercy were too great an <HI>Interruption</HI> in the Solemnities of Worship: But others were filled with <HI>Indignation</HI> at the <HI>Fame</HI> and Glory, which <HI>Christ</HI> hereby procured among the com∣mon People: As he, <HI>Luke</HI> xiii. 14, who answered with <HI>Indignation</HI> because that <HI>Jesus</HI> had healed on the Sab∣bath-day, and said unto the People, — <HI>There are six Days in which Men ought to work, in them therefore come and be healed, and not on the Sabbath-day.</HI> A very <HI>doughty</HI> Speech truly, for Sense and Piety! — But however, this precise Fool and <HI>Hypocrite</HI> would allow that the Sabbath was a <HI>suitable</HI> Time, and the <HI>Synagogue</HI> a proper Place, for the Healing of distemper'd <HI>Souls,</HI> for the Cure of Means <HI>spiritual Maladies.</HI> They are the appointed <HI>stated</HI> Time and Place for these, by the Confession of all Men. If Men ought to labour <HI>six Days,</HI> and provide for their <HI>Housholds</HI> and the Life that now is, yet on the <HI>Sabbath</HI> let 'em bestow all their Care and Pains for their Souls, and come to the <HI>Ordinances,</HI> the ordained Means of <HI>Sanctification</HI> and eternal Life to them. For,</P>
<P N="1">I. CHRIST <HI>is present here,</HI> tho' not <HI>bodily,</HI> yet in <HI>Spirit</HI> and Power; to <HI>meet</HI> miserable Souls, work savingly on 'em, and <HI>heal</HI> 'em of whatever Infirmities and <HI>Plagues</HI> they labour.</P>
<P>This the ascending <HI>Saviour</HI> promis'd, when he gave to his <HI>Apostles</HI> their Commission; Matth. xxviii. ult. "<HI>Go ye and teach all Nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teach∣ing them to observe all things whatsoever I have com∣manded you; and lo I am with you always, even unto the End of the World. Amen.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="004353_0011_100441DFDAF780E0"/>
<HI>Christ</HI> truly is with his <HI>Ministers,</HI> in the Administra∣tion of his Ordinances. He works with them, in them and by them. This is to <HI>Souls,</HI> what the Waters of <HI>Jordan</HI> were to <HI>Naaman,</HI> for his Healing: the Waters of the <HI>Sanctuary</HI> sanctified for the Use and Benefit of Souls. Christ <HI>worketh hitherto,</HI> and the Day of our <HI>Holy Rest</HI> is the Day and Season of his Working on our Souls for their everlasting Good. His <HI>Rest</HI> is glorious in the saving Operations of his <HI>Holy Spirit. He</HI> only, by the Power of his Grace, can heal our Souls. It is not within the Power of <HI>Means</HI> or Instruments to reach the Soul, or produce a <HI>saving</HI> Effect; but it is the <HI>Prero∣gative</HI> and peculiar Glory of <HI>Christ</HI> alone to put <HI>Life</HI> into dead Souls, or Strength into <HI>feeble</HI> Minds, and <HI>to work in us both to will and to do of his good Pleasure.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Divine Effect</HI> manifests a Divine <HI>Presence</HI> and Power, and Ministers or their Ministrations are at best but <HI>Humane,</HI> and nothing able to contribute of them∣selves hereunto. 2 Cor. iv 5, 7. <HI>For we preach not our∣selves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and our selves your Ser∣vants for Jesus sake: For God who commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness, hath shined in our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ: But we have this Treasure in earthen Vessels, that the Excellency of the Power may be of God and not of us.</HI> Mark xvi 20. <HI>They went out and preached every where, the Lord working with them.</HI> Acts iii. 12. <HI>Ye Men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us? as tho' by our own Power or Holiness we had made this Man to walk! The God of our Fathers hath glorified his Son</HI> JESUS, <HI>and his Name thro' Faith in his Name hath made this Man strong, and given him this perfect Soundness in the Presence of you all.</HI></P>
<P>Truly <HI>in vain</HI> do we go to the <HI>House</HI> of God at any Time, in vain do we wait on our <HI>Ministring,</HI> or use the <HI>Instituted Means</HI> of Grace, if we do not believe, realize and rely on the Presence of <HI>Christ,</HI> and the Blessing of his <HI>Spirit</HI> necessary for the <HI>healing</HI> of our Souls. We read of a <HI>certain Day, as Christ was teaching, that the
<PB N="10" REF="004353_0012_1004499F37E6D250"/>Power of the Lord was present to heal,</HI> Luke v. 17. Tru∣ly it is always thus, when ever the <HI>Word of Christ</HI> is duely preached, his <HI>Power is present</HI> as it seems good in his Eyes, to heal what Souls he will.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>The Call of the Word to impotent Souls is always in effect this, "stretch out thy Hand.</HI> The <HI>Lord</HI> now says so to every one here present before him. He saith</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Imploy those Hands in holy Endeavours, to work out your Salvation with Fear and Trembling, for I am ready to work in you to will and to do,</HI> Philip. ii. 13. As he who will <HI>not work</HI> with his Hands, neither shall he <HI>eat,</HI> by the Order of the Gospel; so he who will not <HI>improve</HI> the Powers of his Soul in working out his own Salvati∣on, shall never be <HI>saved.</HI> The <HI>Apostle</HI> calls upon strong and weak together, but especially upon the <HI>Feeble</HI> of the Flock, to <HI>lift up the Hands that hang down, and make strait Paths for their Feet,</HI> Heb. xii. 12. We have a <HI>Race</HI> set before us to <HI>run,</HI> and the good <HI>Warfare</HI> and <HI>Fight of Faith,</HI> which call us to put forth all our <HI>Agility</HI> and Might. Yea with <HI>all our Might</HI> we must set our selves to <HI>do,</HI> whatever our Hand <HI>findeth</HI> to be done, in the great Work of God and our Souls, because there is <HI>no Work, nor Device, nor Knowledge, nor Wisdom in the Grave, whither we are going,</HI> Eccles. ix. 10.</P>
<P N="2">2. God calls us <HI>to lift up our Hands to Him in Prayer, for Life and Strength and Vigour; "that we may obtain Mercy and find Grace to help in all our Needs,</HI> Heb iv. 16. When we <HI>pray</HI> and when we <HI>praise</HI> we are said to <HI>lift up</HI> our Hands in God's Name, and also to <HI>stretch</HI> them forth to Him. It is a <HI>Sign</HI> of spiritual Life and Strength received, and a blessed <HI>Means</HI> of receiving more. Prayer and Labour should go together, as in providing for the natural Life, so also for the Spiritual; first stretch out the <HI>Arm</HI> in Prayer, and then imploy it also in diligent Working: Receive Strength <HI>from God</HI> by the one, and then lay it out <HI>for God</HI> in the other.</P>
<P N="3">3. The <HI>Call of God</HI> to us in his Word is, <HI>that by the Hand of Taith we lay hold of Christ and Eternal Life.</HI>
<PB N="11" REF="004353_0013_100449C51039BF60"/>We can neither pray nor work without <HI>Faith.</HI> It is Faith that gives a Soul <HI>Life,</HI> Strength, Activity. If Faith be <HI>weak,</HI> the Hands hang down and the <HI>Knees</HI> are feeble. Faith makes Prayer <HI>fervent and effectual,</HI> it <HI>wrestles</HI> and holds the <HI>Angel</HI> and prevails. It lays <HI>hold</HI> on the Power and Mercy and Truth of God; on the Co∣venant of Grace and the Righteousness of Christ, on all the precious Promises in Him, and keeps its Hold. <HI>Moses</HI> by Faith <HI>held up</HI> his Hand in the Mount, and kept it up till the Evening, and <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Faith <HI>spread forth</HI> his Arms toward Heaven. We are also taught the Exercise of Faith, and the Property of it, in those Precepts and Phrases, truly Evangelical; "<HI>Lay hold on Eternal Life; lay hold on the Hope before you.
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 <HI>Tim.</HI> vi. 12. <HI>Hebr.</HI> vi. 18.</NOTE>. Faith</HI> is to the <HI>Soul</HI> in doing this, as the <HI>Hand</HI> is to the Body.</P>
<P>Thus as often as we come up to the House of God to <HI>pray</HI> or <HI>hear,</HI> the Voice of God to us is in effect this, "<HI>Impotent Soul, stretch forth thy Hand.</HI> Wherefore,</P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>Impotent as we are, the Lord expects that we try to exert our selves, as well as we can, and in whatso∣ever we can, under the Call of his Word.</HI> When God commands us to do that which is holy and spiritual, his Right from us by the Constitution of our Nature, we may not think to excuse our selves from our Obligation thereto, by pleading the <HI>Weakness</HI> and <HI>Indisposition</HI> which we have wickedly bro't upon our Selves. No, up and <HI>try</HI> and do as thou art <HI>bid.</HI> God looks for some Endeavour, and an instant <HI>Sign</HI> at least of a <HI>Mind</HI> to obey, if you could; and a <HI>Will</HI> to do what you <HI>can.</HI> And surely there is something to be <HI>done</HI> &amp; that you <HI>can</HI> do toward the thing required of you; tho' the thing it self be beyond your Ability.</P>
<P>The God of <HI>Israel</HI> is not like the <HI>Egyptian Task∣masters,</HI> nor their <HI>Tyrant Pharaob,</HI> who exacted the whole Tale of <HI>Bricks</HI> when he refus'd them the <HI>Straw!</HI> No, He will find thee both <HI>Materials</HI> and Wisdom and Strength, if you <HI>listen</HI> to his Word and strive to
<PB N="12" REF="004353_0014_100449A227131CE0"/>obey it. — You must say at least, "<HI>Lord, what will thou have me to do?</HI> O work it in me, both to will and to do it! Would that I had a <HI>Heart</HI> and Power to per∣form! Prepare this in me, and me for thy Self!</P>
<P><HI>Christ</HI> saw the impotent Man lying at the <HI>Pool,</HI> and long had he lain there for Healing, with a <HI>patient</HI> Hope and much Desire; the <HI>Lord</HI> said to him, "<HI>Wilt thou be made whole?</HI> He answered, "<HI>Sir, I have no Man when the Water is troubled to put me into the Pool, but while I am coming another steppeth down before me,</HI> John v. 7. q. d "Ah Lord! <HI>willing</HI> to be made whole? Yes most <HI>gladly</HI> would I! why ly I here waiting but for this desired <HI>Cure?</HI> but my <HI>Impotence</HI> is my Malady! I am <HI>halt</HI> and <HI>wither'd,</HI> and need some kind Hand ready to attend and take and put me in, when the <HI>good Angel</HI> comes down to move the Waters! Good <HI>Sir,</HI> will <HI>You</HI> stay and do me this merciful Office?— Tho' he cou'd do <HI>no</HI> more for himself, tho' he could not <HI>stir</HI> a Hand or Foot, yet this his Wish and <HI>waiting</HI> in the Means of healing, was his Preparation thro' Grace for his finding Favour in the Sight of <HI>Christ,</HI> and Mercy from his Hand. — So <HI>You,</HI> impotent <HI>Soul,</HI> must express your reverend Regards to the <HI>Lord</HI> that heals, to the expected and desired <HI>Cure,</HI> and to the <HI>Means</HI> ordained of God, where he commands the <HI>Blessing:</HI> So You must confide in and look for his Presence in and with his Word; receiving it not <HI>as the Word of Man, but as it is indeed the Word of God, which work∣eth effectually</HI> when and as he pleases. 1 Thess. ii. 13. And this leads me to add in the last Place,</P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>If we are not grosly wanting to God and our own Souls, in doing what we easily might, the gracious Pre∣sence of Christ and his efficacious Blessing would be found in and with his Word upon our Souls, unto all saving Ef∣fects and Purposes.</HI> The Mercy and Grace of God, re∣vealed and proposed to us in the Gospel, supposes this. Christ is <HI>of a Truth in his Word.</HI> Power goes along with it to <HI>make manifest the Secrets of the Heart,</HI> while we <HI>fall down on our Face</HI> before it and under it. 1 Cor. xiv. 25. Let us try to <HI>hear</HI> as for our Life, and see if
<PB N="13" REF="004353_0015_100441E636F98C20"/>God do not give us <HI>an Ear</HI> to hear, and a <HI>Heart</HI> to understand. Are not <HI>God's Ways equal? ours unequal?</HI> Come now, and let us <HI>reason</HI> together, <HI>saith the Lord!</HI> will <HI>God</HI> be wanting to Him that is not wanting sadly to <HI>himself?</HI></P>
<P>Believe it, that Christ says to <HI>You</HI> this Day, as to the <HI>impotent Man</HI> of old, "<HI>Stand forth now in the midst!</HI> present thy self <HI>before me,</HI> who sees thy <HI>Spirit,</HI> now in the Presence of these my People!— And might the blessed <HI>Spirit</HI> of God now <HI>single</HI> out every <HI>One</HI> as by his <HI>Name!</HI> to <HI>Thee</HI> personally, to each <HI>Individual,</HI> it is said! And do <HI>thou</HI> say unto thy Self, "<HI>I am the Man, Woman</HI> or <HI>Child!</HI> and come forth. The Word of thy <HI>Saviour</HI> to thee is, "<HI>Stretch out thy Hand!</HI> exert the remaining Powers of thy feeble Soul, and lift it unto God. — What! will you not <HI>try?</HI> no not to move a <HI>Hand,</HI> or stir a <HI>Finger</HI> at his Word! who <HI>made</HI> thy Hand, and Mouth and living Soul! can he not upon thy Wish and Prayer to <HI>move,</HI> give Strength to <HI>leap up,</HI> as the Feet and Ankle Bones of the <HI>Cripple</HI> found at the <HI>Temple Gate,</HI> Acts iii. 7. He did but <HI>look</HI> when he was bid, and up he <HI>leapt.</HI> Think you the great and com∣passionate God will bid thee <HI>try</HI> in vain? Can he trifle with thee in things of an everlasting Consequence! He is serious, hearty and in good Earnest with thee in the momentous Matter of <HI>Life and Death,</HI> whereon thy everlasting Weal or Woe is depending. — Ah! that <HI>we</HI> were but as <HI>truly</HI> and as much concern'd for our own spiritual and eternal Welfare! but we dally and <HI>trifle</HI> with Heaven, and at last to excuse our own <HI>Sloth</HI> and Folly in the great Concerns of our Souls, we are ready with the wicked and <HI>idle Servant</HI> to cast the Blame on God, and say,— "<HI>Lord, I know that thou art an hard Man, reaping where thou hast not strowed; so I was a∣fraid, and went and hid my Talent in the Earth; lo, there thou hast that was thine,</HI> Matth. xxv. 25. But will <HI>this</HI> serve the Turn? will God be put off with this Pretence, or be satisfied with this <HI>Lye?</HI> No, thou wicked and <HI>slothful Servant,</HI> thy hard and unjust <HI>Tho'ts</HI> of God, and <HI>Speeches</HI> against him, will but <HI>incense</HI> (instead of appeas∣ing) the <HI>Wrath</HI> of God: for what an Aggravation is it
<PB N="14" REF="004353_0016_100449A514B0D060"/>of our Sin, to be ready to charge our wilful <HI>Neglects</HI> and Contempt upon the Severity and <HI>Exaction</HI> of God? which is the Language of our Disobedience, in not set∣ting our Selves to do all we can when God commands. Know therefore that God <HI>exacteth of thee</HI> no more than is <HI>right,</HI> nor will <HI>lay</HI> more upon thee, that thou shouldest enter into Judgment with Him. "<HI>O that God would speak, and shew thee the Secrets of Wisdom; that they are double to</HI> that which is known to us, in all that He <HI>requires</HI> of us, and in all his <HI>Judgments</HI> on us. <HI>Job.</HI> xi. 5, 6.</P>
<P>Suffer me then to speak a little in God's behalf! And wilt thou know <HI>O vain Man,</HI> that there is something you have to do, which God requires and expects, &amp; which he will <HI>make</HI> you to do if ever his Mercy &amp; <HI>Grace</HI> do take Effect upon you. You have <HI>natural Powers</HI> made for use, and you can't pretend that you cannot <HI>think,</HI> con∣sider of things and <HI>reason</HI> with your Self about them, and <HI>wish</HI> and <HI>ask</HI> of God his Pity, Help and Pardon, his In∣fluence and Power upon thy poor languid Soul. Altho' your Strength and Limbs are utterly gone, yet can you <HI>ly and look</HI> up unto God on High, to perform all things for you. "<HI>Look on us,</HI> said <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> to the <HI>Criple!</HI> that he could do, tho' he could neither <HI>rise, stand</HI> or <HI>walk!</HI> and as he <HI>look'd</HI> he <HI>leap'd</HI> too at the Name of JESUS.</P>
<P>Only <HI>look to Jesus,</HI> and He can give thee <HI>Faith to be healed.</HI> The <HI>dumb</HI> could look to him, the <HI>blind cried</HI> after him; "<HI>Thou Son of David have Mercy on us!</HI> So did blind <HI>Bartimeus,</HI> as he sat <HI>begging</HI> by the High∣way, and when <HI>the Lord stood still</HI> they say to him, "<HI>Be of good Comfort, rise, he calleth thee,</HI> Mark x. 49.</P>
<P>Come, <HI>ly</HI> not <HI>still</HI> at Christ's <HI>Call!</HI> say not to Him, "<HI>I cannot stir!</HI> it were to reproach his Calling thee, and to suspect his Power or Truth! for will he <HI>require</HI> of thee that which he will not <HI>help</HI> thee to do! for tho' <HI>of thy self</HI> thou canst do nothing to a <HI>saving</HI> Ef∣fect upon thy Soul, yet <HI>Christ strengthning thee</HI> thou shalt be able to do <HI>all</HI> things, whatsoever he says unto thee. —Thou art not a <HI>Stock</HI> neither in respect of Motion,
<PB N="15" REF="004353_0017_100449C7E34367A0"/>nor a meer <HI>brute</HI> Creature in respect of Understanding; but thou canst say to thy Self, "<HI>Where is God my Ma∣ker? who teacheth us more than the Beasts of the Earth, and maketh us wiser than the Fowls of Heaven! None say</HI> this to themselves, says <HI>Elihu,</HI> and yet they may charge God foolishly that he is wanting in Regards to them! but it follows—"<HI>Surely God will not hear Va∣nity, neither will the Almighty regard it! Altho' thou say st thou shalt not see Him, yet Judgment is before Him, therefore trust thou in Him,</HI> Job xxxv. 14. — Say then to thy self, "Where is the GOD that made me? and what must I do for this <HI>living Soul</HI> which He has made me? <HI>Men and Brethren what must we do?</HI> Will <HI>God,</HI> his Word, his <HI>Spirit,</HI> or even his <HI>Minister,</HI> some <HI>Ana∣nias,</HI> in this <HI>Case</HI> be wanting? for "<HI>behold he prayeth</HI></P>
<P>I will lay down, and leave with You, a few <HI>Maxims</HI> and <HI>Rules</HI> of Truth, which are proper <HI>Corrolarys</HI> on what has been said, and may be of great <HI>Use</HI> in the im∣portant Matter of Conversion and Salvation.</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>There is no Inability ever to be pleaded, where Christ commands.</HI> For wilt thou dare to object against a plain Order and Command of God, or question the Equity or Righteousness of what He requires? If He bid thee go on the <HI>Waters,</HI> they shall <HI>bear</HI> thee, as they did <HI>Peter,</HI> till his <HI>Faith sank;</HI> or if he order thee thro' the <HI>Fires,</HI> thou shalt bear them; and as the <HI>Prophet</HI> speaks shalt not be <HI>burnt.</HI> If he bid thee <HI>fly</HI> up to Heaven, he will give thee Faith and <HI>Eagles Wings,</HI> or his <HI>Angels</HI> shall bear thee up in their Arms. No <HI>Hesitancy</HI> may be allow'd in us, where God positively declares his Will. "<HI>Lord</HI> said <HI>Moses, I am not Eloquent, but of a slow Tongue, a well since Thou hast spoken to me, as before!</HI> And the <HI>Lord</HI> said to him, "<HI>Who hath made Man's Mouth? <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> who maketh the dumb or deaf, the seeing or the blind have not I the Lord? Now therefore go, and I will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> with thy Mouth,</HI> Exod. iv 11.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>Not to offer and attempt when God commands plain Disobedience. Angels</HI> stand ready all Ways to <HI>fly</HI> God's Order: they <HI>excel in Strength</HI> by <HI>hearkning
<PB N="16" REF="004353_0018_100441C1EA63AF40"/>the Voice of his Word;</HI> they are ever <HI>on the Wing</HI> to go <HI>swiftly:</HI> "Thy <HI>Will</HI> be done on <HI>Earth</HI> as it is by <HI>Them!</HI> —Seem it <HI>above</HI> the Power of Nature, or (which is more) <HI>against</HI> Nature, if <HI>God</HI> say <HI>do it,</HI> all that re∣mains for us is, like <HI>Abraham,</HI> to <HI>rise early</HI> and go about it, and go thro' it. So shines the <HI>Father of the Faithful</HI> in the Eyes of all his spiritual <HI>Seed,</HI> their bright <HI>Leader</HI> and Example to the End of the World! and so <HI>shone</HI> he in the Sight of God and of his <HI>Angels:</HI> Gen. xxii. 12, 16. "<HI>Now know I that thou fearest God!</HI> And <HI>by my Self have I sworn saith the Lord, because thou hast done this thing, that in blessing I will bless thee! because thou hast obeyed my Voice.</HI> It is thus always with the Soul, whom it pleases God to <HI>call by his Grace,</HI> and <HI>to reveal his Son in;</HI> immediately <HI>it confers not with Flesh and Blood;</HI> raises no <HI>Scruples,</HI> makes no <HI>Objection,</HI> but is all <HI>Ear</HI> and Duty; "<HI>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? "Speak Lord, for thy Servant heareth.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. <HI>It is no ways unjust or absurd for God to command us to do those things, which of our Selves we are unable to do, because He is able to make all Grace to abound to us, and to give us an Alsufficiency in all things, unto our abounding to every good Word and Work,</HI> 2 Cor. ix. 8. We may not <HI>stagger</HI> at any Precept or Promise of God, no not tho' our <HI>Soul be dead</HI> to it as was <HI>Abraham's Body.</HI> When the <HI>Lord</HI> said to the <HI>Apostle Paul, "My Grace is sufficient for Thee; for my Strength is made perfect in Weakness;</HI> how nobly did the <HI>Saint</HI> answer? "<HI>Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my Infirmities, that the Power of Christ may rest upon me,</HI> 2 Cor. xii 9. The <HI>Lord's</HI> Reproof to <HI>Sarah</HI> silences every rising Doubt or Fear; Gen. xviii. 14. <HI>Is any thing too hard for the Lord?</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. <HI>There is a Promise of Grace given with the Com∣mandment, which every one, set to obey, may humbly and confidently depend upon.</HI> Prov i. 23. <HI>Turn you at my Re∣proof; behold I will pour out my Spirit unto You, I will make known my Words to you.</HI> Isai. xliv. 1, 2, &amp;c. <HI>Yet now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, O Jacob my Servant, and Israel whom I have chosen! Thus saith the Lord that made and formed thee
<PB N="17" REF="004353_0019_100441EB814A5668"/>from the Womb, which will help thee; fear not! For I will pour Water upon Him that is thirsty, and Floods on the dry Ground; I will pour my Spirit upon thy Seed, and my Blessing upon thy Offspring! And they shall spring up as among the Grass, as Willows by the Water-courses: One shall say, I am the Lord's! and another shall call himself by the Name of Jacob; and another shall sub∣scribe with his Hand to the Lord, and surname himself by the Name of Israel. Thus saith the Lord the King of Israel, and his Redeemer the Lord of Hosts; "I am the first and I am the last, and beside Me there is no God: And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in Order for me, since I appointed the ancient People? and the things that are coming and shall come? let them shew them. Fear ye not, neither be afraid! have not I told thee from that Time, and have declared it? Ye are even my Witnesses: "Is there a God besides me? yea there is no God, I know not any.</HI></P>
<P N="5">V. <HI>Those that perish are verily guilty and convicted in their own Consciences, of wilful Indolence &amp; Inactivity.</HI> As suppose that this <HI>Man</HI> had refus'd to <HI>try</HI> whether he could <HI>reach out his withered Arm;</HI> had it not been <HI>contemptu∣ous</HI> to Christ? and would it not have been <HI>just</HI> upon him, <HI>never</HI> to have been healed? Or could he expect that Christ <HI>wou'd</HI> heal him? — Could he have <HI>pleaded</HI> his Impotence, or would it have <HI>excus'd</HI> him in the least? — Not to <HI>endeavour</HI> under a <HI>Divine Call,</HI> is to reject the <HI>Motions</HI> of Divine Grace, and to resist, grieve and quench the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI> And this alas! is the <HI>Condem∣nation</HI> under the <HI>Gospel:</HI> Acts vii 51. <HI>Ye uncircumcised in Heart and Ears, ye do always resist the</HI> HOLY GHOST, <HI>as your Fathers did, so do ye.</HI> Eph. iv. 30. <HI>And grieve not the Holy Spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the Day of Redemption.</HI> 1 Thess. v. 17, 19, 22. <HI>Pray without ceasing, quench not the Spirit, despise not Pro∣phesyings, abstain from all Appearance of Evil: And the very God of Peace sanctify you wholly; and I pray God your whole Spirit Soul and Body be preserved Hame∣less unto the Coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</HI></P>
<P N="6"><PB N="18" REF="004353_0020_100449A6C55A9B00"/>
VI. <HI>They that are saved have nothing to boast of, but the whole Glory must be given to the free Grace of God alone, and his Almighty Power.</HI> What tho' the poor Man <HI>did</HI> at the Command of Christ <HI>stretch</HI> forth his Hand, and found it immediately <HI>restored!</HI> What tho' the <HI>Cripple look'd</HI> wishfully at the <HI>Apostles,</HI> and at the Name of JESUS leapt up on his Legs! What tho' the the <HI>Lepers</HI> went to wash in Obedience to the Word of Christ, and as they were going found themselves <HI>made clean!</HI> was there any thing in the <HI>Obedience</HI> of one or other of them that could <HI>claim</HI> any part of the <HI>Glory</HI> of the Cure? By no means! who gave 'em the <HI>Heart</HI> and <HI>Wisdom</HI> to obey so readily the <HI>Divine Precept?</HI> who gave 'em <HI>Faith</HI> to be healed? and who <HI>put</HI> Strength into the wither'd <HI>Arm</HI> and <HI>Legs</HI> to reach out and leap up? — To the <HI>Power</HI> and <HI>Grace</HI> of God therefore we ascribe all the <HI>Praise</HI> and Glory; for of it alone could the Effect be expected. Well therefore was it to see the <HI>Cripple</HI> that had been, leaping and <HI>praising God;</HI> and to see <HI>One of the Lepers</HI> turn back and <HI>give Glory to God with a loud Voice,</HI> and cast himself down <HI>at Jesus Feet.</HI> We can neither <HI>work</HI> Grace in our Selves, nor in the least <HI>deserve</HI> it at the Hand of God; but the <HI>Chief of Saints</HI> must say, "<HI>By the Grace of God I am what I am, and his Grace given me was not in vain!</HI> and if under the Power of it I have <HI>laboured</HI> more than others, than <HI>all</HI> others, <HI>yet not I, but the Grace of God which was with me.</HI> 1 Cor. xv. 10.</P>
<P N="7">VII. We learn upon all, <HI>that it is our incumbent Duty to be found in the diligent Use of Means, but not to trust in them.</HI></P>
<P>With all our Soul and Mind and Strength we must endeavour to comply with the Demands of the Gospel, but at the same time (as <HI>Workers together with God,</HI> and altogether under Him) to <HI>rely</HI> on Him alone to <HI>work all in us and for us.</HI> The <HI>little</HI> Powers we have we must <HI>put forth,</HI> for Strength to do the <HI>whole</HI> Will of God; but our <HI>Dependance</HI> on God must be such as the greatest <HI>Inability</HI> to the <HI>least</HI> of it can suppose. When we have most considered, and prayed and <HI>strained</HI>
<PB N="19" REF="004353_0021_10049D55CD31CEC0"/>our feeble Powers, we must give all the Honour to free and Sovereign <HI>Grace,</HI> if there be any saving Effect produced: "<HI>Not I, but the Grace of God with me.</HI>—At the Word of <HI>Christ</HI> try to <HI>stretch out</HI> thy wi∣ther'd Hand; and if it be <HI>restored</HI> fall down at his <HI>sa∣cred Feet,</HI> and adore the Mercy and Compassion glori∣fied to a <HI>wretched Miserable,</HI> a <HI>vile</HI> Sinner and the <HI>chief of Sinners.</HI> Let the <HI>Lord</HI> find thee in his <HI>House of Prayer,</HI> impotent Soul, and do thou <HI>listen</HI> to his Word there, and <HI>lay it up</HI> in thy Heart, and carry it to thy <HI>House</HI> and <HI>Closet,</HI> and pray over it (pray it over) with thy <HI>Family,</HI> and in <HI>secret;</HI> and thy <HI>Father</HI> who sees in <HI>secret,</HI> and into the inmost Recesses of the <HI>Heart,</HI> shall abundantly and <HI>openly</HI> reward thee! there is no <HI>saving Fruit</HI> and Effect of his <HI>Grace</HI> but you may then humbly <HI>hope</HI> to receive from Him.</P>
<P>Philip. iv. 13, 19, 20. <HI>I can do all things thro'</HI> CHRIST <HI>which strengthneth me! and my God shall supply all your Need, according to his Riches in Glory by Jesus Christ! Now unto</HI> GOD <HI>and our</HI> FATHER <HI>be Glory, for ever and ever. Amen.</HI></P>
