<OPENER><SALUTE>My dear Hearers, Grace and Mercy be multiplied unto you, now, and for evermore.</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN we consider, that soon after the Begin∣ning, the eternal Father, having brought forth this whole Creation of his, sat on a Throne, glorious, exalted and lifted up on high, sur∣rounded by Hosts of exulting Angels (those Morning Stars that sang together, those Sons of God that shouted for Joy) viewing every Thing he had made, pronouncing it all, <HI>very good;</HI> and we do then reflect on the present Situation of Affairs among Mortals, we must condole the Fate of our Globe, as being changed from a Garden of God, an Eden, a Paradise of Holiness, Joy and Fe∣licity, into a Haunt of impure Spirits, a Scene of Sin, Horror, Woe and Disappointment, a Lazar-house of Anguish and Torture, infested with Wars and Rumors of Wars, Famines, Earthquakes, Inundations, Confla∣grations, Diseases, Pestilences, Deaths. And, notwith∣standing this Reflection, gloomy as it is, we would be very foolish indeed, if we thought the infinitely wise, and great JEHOVAH, to whom all his Works are known from Eternity, had been frustrated in his Scheme, he concerted to demonstrate the Glory of his eternal Power and Deity;—he who calleth the Things that are not, as if they were, can bring forth Light out of Darkness, and
<PB N="4" REF="007421_0003_102D83E4E2CB5D28"/>
Life out of Death;—he is both wise and able, by his absolute and irresistable Providence, so to over-rule the greatest Evils, that they serve the wisest and most glorious Purposes.—Had there been no Fall, no Need had there been of a Redeemer; nor should the Saints in Glory ever have had Reason to adore the Love, Mercy, and free Grace of God, which saved them from so great Damna∣tion, as the Vessels of his Wrath and Indignation, shall suffer in the horrid Abyss, burning with Fire and Sul∣pher unconsumed, prepared for the Devil and his apos∣tate Crew. It is indeed an awful Reflection, that this our Globe shall, in the last Conflagration, be all in a Blaze of Fire; but that it will serve to purify and renew it, makes more than ample Amends.—And do we animad∣vert upon the Calamities and Tribulations that befall a sinful World, we shall soon perceive that they serve wise Purposes, <HI>to wit,</HI> that Sinners may learn Righteousness, and that Saints by their Patience and Resignation to the eternal Decree of Heaven, by their Courage and godly Heroism, may glorify the heavenly Father, when they fight the Battles of the Lord Sebaoth.</P>
<P>Therefore our blessed Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, with so much Calmness and Composure of Mind, fore-tells his Disciples, what great Changes should happen on the Earth, before the End of the World come—The Temple at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> should be destroyed, that not one Stone be left upon the other, <HI>Judea</HI> laid waste and de∣solate, and the <HI>Jewish</HI> State abolished.—As they were nearly concerned in this (and the human Mind is always inquisitive) they came privately unto him, and said, Tell us, Lord, when shall these Things be? And what shall be the Sign of thy coming, and of the End of the World?—Jesus cautions them against the Delusions <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Impostors, who should come in his Name, and dece<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> many, by high Protestations and marvalous Predictio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P>And in order to settle their Minds, and at the sa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> Time not to leave them altogether ignorant of Futur<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="5" REF="007421_0003_102D83E4E2CB5D28"/>
he reveals unto them the Fate of the World, before the great and tremendous Day of Conflagration, and Con∣summation of all Things come; <HI>to wit,</HI> that there shall be terrible Calamities and doleful Tribulations on Earth, occasioned by Wars, Famines, Pestilences, Earthquakes, Persecutions and Impostures.—Against all which Jesus exhorts them to stand, not only with manly Resolution and Courage, but also with godly Heroism and Magna∣nimity of Soul, saying, Ye shall hear of Wars, and Rumors of Wars: See that ye be not troubled; for all these Things must come to pass, but the End is not yet.</P>
<P>So that the Words of my Text contain a Prediction of our blessed Lord, wherein he foretells his Disciples, that it should be the Fate of the World to be molested with Wars and Rumors of Wars, at the same Time commanding and charging them not to be troubled thereat, but to have good Courage, and to be inspired with godly Heroism and divine Magnanimity, from a Consideration that these Things were ordained and de∣creed so to be, and so to happen, before the End of the World come.</P>
<P>If ever any Words were apposite to an Occasion, these are so to our present Situation, while we not only hear of Wars and Rumors of Wars, at a Distance, but are upon an Expedition, to remove the Encroachments our antichristian Neighbours, who also are our great Enemies, have made on our Borders: For which End this Army, in the Midst of which I stand, is raised, and now soon to go forth to meet their Adversaries in an awful Instant, in a critical Conjuncture, and in a portentous Interval, that must determine our great Dispute.</P>
<P>I do then bend my Knees; I lift up my Eyes to the open Canopy of Heaven; I spread out my Hands unto the Lord, my God, and pray from the Bottom of my Heart; give Eear, O Shepherd of <HI>Israel,</HI> thou that leadest <HI>Joseph</HI> like a Flock, thou that dwellest between the Cherubim, shine forth before <HI>Ephraim</HI> and <HI>Benjamin,</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="007421_0004_102D83E7170F6970"/>
and <HI>Manassah,</HI> stir up thy Strength, and come and save us. O Lord, God of Hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the Prayer of thy People? Turn us again, O God of Hosts, and cause thy Face to shine, and we shall be saved.</P>
<P>In order that I may lay open and unfold the Pre∣diction of the Lord, I shall stand up and speak, as the Lord pleaseth to grant me Utterance (and O Lord, do thou enlighten me by thy holy Spirit, strengthen and support me by thy omnipotent Hand. Let one of the celestial Seraphims come with a live Coal from thy Altar, and touch my Heart and my Mouth, that I may speak as it becometh me to speak) of these three great Things.</P>
<P>First, That it is the Fate of the World, to be molested by Wars and Rumors of Wars.</P>
<P>Secondly, That the People of God must see to it, that they be not troubled thereat; but be inspired with good Courage and godly Heroism.</P>
<P>Thirdly, That these Things are ordained and decreed, so to be, and so to happen, before the End of the World cometh.</P>
<P>As to the first; we must remark, that he who here speaketh, is our blessed Lord, who speaketh not as Men speak, often by meer Conjecture, or from external Ap∣pearances of Things, but with divine Infallibility, and never-erring Authority. All Things, past, present, and to come, are known to him: And it is his Province to reveal unto his Prophets and Saints, whatsoever he sees fit they should know. Wherefore he doth here lay open and unfold to his Disciples, the Fate and Lot of the World in general, and that of <HI>Judea</HI> in particular; which is, that they should <HI>hear of Wars and Rumors of Wars:</HI> Wars present, and Wars at a distance, but in Prospect; a Succession of Wars and Rumors of Wars: Scarce was the one past, but the other was near at Hand, even at the Doors.—And it hath Weight with me, that to Wars, here are added Rumors of Wars: Because it
<PB N="7" REF="007421_0004_102D83E7170F6970"/>
is with Wars, as with other temporary Evils we fear and dread, that the Prospect of them oftentimes is more terrible and more alarming, than the Experience of the very Thing itself; though not always, but sometimes the reverse—We have at present no more than Rumors of Wars, and it hath put us to such Preparation (which it ought to do) to such Expences, to such Labour and Toil, that we wish for War itself; nay, we conceive, if War in Fact do not come, the Rumors of War we have had, would press very heavily upon us—And be felt throughout our whole Land a long Time.</P>
<P>Do we endeavour to trace the first Origin of Wars, we may find that they descend from a grand Battle that was fought in Heaven, when Satan threw of his Alle∣giance from the eternal Father, and with his Apostates waged War against <HI>Michael</HI> and his Angels—Satan lost the Battle (for how should he stand against the Almighty?) And was doom'd to the infernal Abyss, there to suffer with his apostate Crew, the everlasting Condemnation of Hell-fire, as Saint <HI>Jude</HI> saith in his Epistle, and the Angels which kept not their first Estate, but left their own Habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting Chains under Darkness, unto the Judgment of the great Day— Satan notwithstanding, by the Sufferance of Heaven, found Means to come upon this earthly Globe; on which Man was created, good and upright, after the Image and Likeness of his great Maker, whom the arch Enemy of God and Man beguiled, deceived and perverted, to fall off from his Creator, and to enter into Allegiance with him—And hence spring Wars and Rumors of Wars on Earth.—</P>
<P>There is not only Enmity sat between the Seed of the Woman, and the Seed of the Serpent, but Mankind in general is become hateful and hating one another: From which Motive it came to pass that <HI>Cain</HI> slew his Brother <HI>Abel</HI>—The Antidaluvian Giants were Men of Renown, and mighty in Feats of Arms, and withall exceeding
<PB N="8" REF="007421_0005_102D83EB63A44868"/>
wicked—<HI>Tubal Cain,</HI> the Inventor of Weapons of Death, and <HI>Lamech</HI> the revengeful, and others, no doubt, as well as <HI>Nimrod,</HI> hunted after Man and Beast—And soon after the Flood, the Inhabitants of the Earth being a little multiplied, began again to wage Wars against one another, and have persevered in that Practice to our Times, as History both sacred and prophane, will testify abundantly—God's favourite People of old, the <HI>Jews,</HI> during the whole Existence of their Theocracy, Hierar∣chy, Monarchy, Aristocracy, and Democracy, have had to struggle with an almost uninterrupted Series of Wars, until at last they were compleatly conquered by the <HI>Ro∣mans</HI>—The <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the <HI>Assyrians,</HI> the <HI>Babylonians,</HI> the <HI>Grecians,</HI> the <HI>Barbarians</HI> and <HI>Scythians,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> and the <HI>Macedonians,</HI> together will almost all Nations on the whole terraqueous Globe, in <HI>Asia,</HI> in <HI>Africa,</HI> in <HI>Europe,</HI> and in <HI>America,</HI> in both the <HI>Indies,</HI> and on the Isles in the Sea, far and near, have levied many cruel Wars, soon after the Fall of Man, unto this present Day; and will do so still, for some Time.</P>
<P>Of old, Wars were carried on in a more simple Manner, than they are now a-Days—Man fought with Spears, Javelins, Swords, Slings, Darts, Bows and Arrows— They had indeed their Kings, their Armies, and their Chieftains, but were void and destitute of that Pomp and Grandeur, which is now seen in military Affairs— Some times indeed, they made Use of battering Rams, to beat down the Walls of a besieged City, and of great Engines to throw and whirl huge Stones, to annoy their Adversari<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> as the <HI>Romans</HI> did in the Siege of <HI>Jeru∣salem,</HI> when the Abomination of Desolation, as it was predicted and prophesied, came upon the holy Land, and upon the holy Place:—But they were nothing to our Cannon.—</P>
<P>The Discovery of Gun-powder hath made a surprising Alteration in the Affairs of War; it takes away the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> between

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he strong and the weak, except only that it allows a greater Chance to small and puny Bodies, to escape the fatal Lead, than it doth to great and robust ones—It derides the Shield and the Buckler, the Harness and the Coat of Mail, nay, would even pierce the Scales of the Leviathan, that Sea Beast, hugest of God's Works, who laugheth at the shaking of the Spear; the Dart and the Habergeon are his Sport—Walls of Stone, and Trenches dug in the Ground, are not a sufficient Bulwark against the hollow Engines and the Iron Globes; and should they stand their terrible Shock, the very Earth may be undermined, and torn up from her Caverns, by the horrid Blast of Gunpowder; by created Force and Power not to be resisted—It is a Thing so terrible, that <HI>Milton</HI> in his Paradile Lost, ascribes the Invention of it to the Devil, when he fought against the good Angels, whereby they were much pestered.</P>

I acknowledge both of them are of some Use but in my Opinion, the Abuse is far greater.</P>
<P>The Scene of War is a horrid Scene. Nation riseth up against Nation, and Kingdom agains<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Freedom. Warriors are levied; Armies are raised; they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up to meet one another, Front to Front, a horrid Front!— The hollow Engines roar, the aetherial Sky is fill'd with Fire, Smoke and Thunder—Swords and Arms clash; the fatal Lead, and the Weapons of Death, dislode many a wretched Soul from a mangled Body—They lie sprawling, gasping, agonizing, dying, Row by Row— The Trumpets sound; the Drums beat, and the Wa∣riors shout, that by the Din and Clangor of the Living, the Peals of the Wounded, and the Groans of the Dying, may not be heard—Painted Savages, cruel Barbarians, deformed and disfigured as Devils incarnate, stark na∣ked like infernal Serpents, lie sculking and stalking about, thirsting after Blood; now hovering hither and thither, as Vultures and Harpies of Prey; then rush in, yelling and screaming, as Hell-hounds destroying human kind— Death and Slaughter are spread all around; reeking Gore and mixed Carnage, are trodden under Foot of Man and Beast—Heads, Arms, Limbs, Members, Joints, and mangled Bodies, strew the Ground—Here lies an Officer, and there a Soldier, weltering in Blood, fast asleep in Iron Slumbers, not to be awaked, though his Scalp is taken off, before the last Trumpet blows— Here lies one quite dead, and yet with haughty Brow, as if not conquered; there one expiring, frowning and threat∣ning Death as he dies; and in that Place one frightned to Death, before he was shot in his Flight, seems yet to fly after the Soul hath fled the Body. Another is so wounded that he can neither live nor die. Yonder I see a dire Sight. The Ground upon which the Warriors
<PB N="11" REF="007421_0006_102D83ED0248F600"/>
stand, they think is firm and solid Land; but behold! All is hollow and undermined: Now are they blown up in the Air with horrible Noise and Ruin; and falling down, are buried neither dead nor alive—The Victory hangs doubtful for a While, now inclining to the one, and then to the other, and sometimes to neither Side— When the one Army flies, the other pursues; and when neither flies, perhaps the greatest Part fall together; and Thousands of Mortals are sent to the other World— And those that survive, remain either a free People, or in Bondage, Captives and Slaves, as they have been fa∣voured with glorious Victory, or been constrained to suffer foul Defeat—The whole Nation or Kingdom at Home, feels the Consequences of the Battle fought in the Field—This is War by Land.—</P>
<P>And the Seas, as if of themselves they were not trou∣blesome enough, are often infested by Wars—Not the raging Billows, yawning to devour and swallow up, not the blusterous Winds, not Hurricanes and Tornadoes, on Account of which, they who follow the Seas, ought to have their Breasts armed with threefold Brass, are so terrible as the Fire, Smoke and Thunder of the floating Castles, driving on under a croud of Canvass, and vo∣miting Flame and Fire, worse than <HI>Aetna</HI> and <HI>Vesuvius</HI>— Some sink and some swim; some have Sails and Tackle torn; some are foundered, bilged and wrecked; others sat on Fire, and blown up in the Skies—The Ocean flows with Blood all around, and the adjacent Land is shock'd by an Earthquake—They that go down to the Sea in Ships, they that trade and do Business on great Waters, sometimes fall into the Hands of Pirates and Buccani<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rs, who rob and dispoil them of every Thing, and send them to the other World, or a begging Home, or to a strange Land lost and forlorn.</P>
<P>Methinks I hear you by this Time say, is this the Tenor, and this the Base of Wars? Then are they a Disgrace to the human Species! Yes, so they are—Man

in this Respect excells (if in Cruelty there be any Ex∣cellence) Bears and Tigers, Wolves and Lions, who very seldom, if ever, prey upon their own Species; nay, less prone are they to Harmony among themselves, than even the Apostate Angels.</P>
<Q><L>O Shame to Man! Devil with Devil damn'd</L>
<L>Firm Concord holds, Men only disagree</L>
<L>Of Creatures rational, though under Hope</L>
<L>Of heavenly Grace: And God proclaiming Peace,</L>
<L>Yet live in Hatred, Enmity and Strife</L>
<L>Among themselves, and levy cruel Wars,</L>
<L>Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy:</L>
<L>As if (which might induce us to accord)</L>
<L>Man had not hellish Foes enough besides,</L>
<L>That Day and Night for his Destruction wait.</L></Q>
<P>God will judge the Nations, no Doubt, who levy Wars without a just Cause. The Slaughter and Mas∣sacre, the innocent Blood poured out as Water on the Ground, crieth aloud against them, for Vengeance from Heaven. If <HI>Cain,</HI> who slew his Brother <HI>Abel,</HI> was to be avenged seven Fold, and <HI>Lamech,</HI> who slew a Man to his Wound, and a young Man to his Heart, Seventy and seven Fold, my God! what will be the Retribution of those who for the Sake of gratifying their base Lusts, of Pride, Ambition, Covetousness and Luxury, and an insatiable Thirst after Wealth and Dominion, Fame and Puissance, and universal Empire, have been the Cause of sending Thousands of immortal Souls, and many very unprepared too, into the World of Spirits? They cer∣tainly will have a very heavy Reckoning to answer at the great Day of Account, because of the Injustice they have done to their fellow Creatures.</P>
<P>And notwithstanding all this; that Wars in a just Cause, when our Religion, our Lives, our Liberties, and Properties are concerned, are both lawful and our indispensible Duty, appears from the Nature of Things, from God's Dealings with his favourite People, and from

the Oracles of sacred and inspired Truth every where— If it be lawful for me, when a Highwayman, a Robber, or an Assassin endeavours to take away my Life, that I in my own Defence, from a Principle of Self-preserva∣tion, implanted in human Nature, take away his Life, how much more is it lawful and expedient for a whole Nation or Kingdom, when their Religion, their Lives, their Liberties, their Possessions, and all that, which of temporal Blessings is precious and dear unto them, is in the utmost Danger of being snatched away at one fatal Grasp, to cut off from the Land of the living, those common and universal Robbers, those Pests to Mankind, and those Plagues to human Society, that will at any Time, set the whole World in Uproar, unjustly to ag∣grandize themselves by the Spoils and Ruin of others? —Nay, is it lawful for me, when in the Night, a Thief breaks through into my House, that I kill him upon the Spot, not knowing but his Intention may be to kill me, because a Thief is a Murderer, how much more is it lawful to a Nation, a Kingdom, or People, when ano∣ther Nation or People discovers a dark Design, by break∣ing through Limits, Borders and Boundaries, through Treaties and Covenants, in Time of Peace, incroaching and shedding innocent Blood, to repel, in the Fear of the Lord, by Force, the Force and Violence of the grand Thief, who, when he has stolen enough, always falls a murdering and a butchering? What did <HI>Abram,</HI> the <HI>He∣brew</HI> do, when <HI>Lot,</HI> his Brothers Son, was taken Captive <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y <HI>Chadarlaomer,</HI> and the Kings that were with him?

Bondage and Misery—The Supreme Being, the eternal Father of all Things, is the sole Proprietor of this our Globe, who by his Providence, distributes and allots to Nations their sundry Heritage and Portions, unto which as they have a Right, either by express com∣mand from Heaven, or by first Discovery or Possession, they ought to be contented with—God gave the Land of <HI>Canaan</HI> to <HI>Israel</HI> his favourite People of old; he commanded them to drive out the idolatrous Nations inhabiting the same—<HI>Moses,</HI> under God, the Leader of the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Host, was very willing to execute the Lords Command. Let us remember how he held up his Hands on the Top of Mount <HI>Horeb,</HI> when <HI>Israel</HI> fought against <HI>Amalek; Aaron</HI> and <HI>Hur,</HI> staying up his Hands when they were become heavy—How did he exhort and encourage <HI>Israel</HI> to be valiant? For the Lord your God, is he that goeth with you, said he, to fight for you against your Enemies, to save you—And I may not forget thee <HI>Joshua,</HI> Son of <HI>Nun,</HI> so eager to smite the <HI>Amorites,</HI> that by thy Prayer thou prolonged the Day of Battle, in order to obtain a compleat Victory, by making the Sun to stand still at <HI>Gibeon,</HI> and the Moon in the Valley of <HI>Ajalon</HI>— Should I speak of the Judges in <HI>Israel,</HI> of ancient <HI>Caleb,</HI> the Son of <HI>Jephuna,</HI> of <HI>Othniel,</HI> his loving Son-in-Law, of <HI>Ehud,</HI> who with a Word and a Blow, brought God's Message to <HI>Eglon,</HI> the <HI>Moabytish</HI> King, and of <HI>Shamyer</HI> who with an Ox Goad slew Six Hundred <HI>Philistins;</HI> and of thee <HI>Deborah,</HI> thou Prophetess, and Mother in <HI>Israel</HI> thou heroic Woman; and of thee <HI>Barak,</HI> who conq<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Sisera, Jabius</HI> Substitute, ye acted valiently, in fig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Battles of the Lord—Nor can I pass thee by <HI>Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> Son of <HI>Joash,</HI> who first waged War against <HI>Baal</HI> and his Altar and Grove, then against the <HI>Medianites,</HI> victorious in both, but not well rewarded by thy own People.

Although conquered by a Woman, he was un∣conquerable by his Enemies, or by Death! The Rest were long to tell: And I have said enough to shew, that the Judges in <HI>Israel</HI> waged War in the Name of the Lord, and that the Lord was with them—And not only with them, but even King <HI>Saul,</HI> though none of the best of Men, had God's Blessing on him in his Wars, until he was disobedient unto the Lord's Voice. <HI>Jonathan,</HI> that lovely Prince, a better Man than his Father, how did he with his Armor Bearer, in the Strength of the Lord, defeat the Garrison of the <HI>Philistins!</HI> Pious King <HI>David,</HI> how often did he consult God concerning his Battles; Lord shall I go forth and engage with them, or shall I not?

And having God's Permission, and his Word of Promise, he went forth, fought valiantly, and returned triumphant—King <HI>Asa,</HI> and King <HI>Hezekia,</HI> being sore beset, the one by the <HI>Aethiopians,</HI> the other by the <HI>Assyrians,</HI> in their Distress, cried unto the Lord; he heard their Prayers, and fought for them against their Enemies—What a surprising De∣liverance was wrought by the Hands of <HI>Judith,</HI> that goodly Woman, that <HI>Heroine,</HI> who smote off the Head of <HI>Holophernes!</HI> And the <HI>Maccabees,</HI> what great Deeds did they do in Feats of War, all the while putting their Trust in the Mighty One of <HI>Israel!</HI> which, though it be written in the <HI>Apocrypha,</HI> is nevertheless worthy of No∣tice, and very much to our Purpose.—</P>
<P>Thus have ye before you, my Brethren, a Cloud of Witnesses to evidence, that to fight the Battles of the Lord, is both lawful and well pleasing in his Sight, who governs the Universe—But perhaps ye will say, this was
<PB N="16" REF="007421_0009_102D83F4C7E5CE08"/>
connived at in the Times of Forbearance; but since Light and Immortality hath been more clearly displayed by the Gospel Dispensation, it was not so among the Saints—Remember than the Exhortation of <HI>John the Baptist,</HI> to the Soldiers: Do Violence to no Man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with your Wages, for how could they expect Wages, if it was not permitted to fight, when it was required of them? He doth not say unto them, your Calling is bad in itself, and there∣fore I can give you no Directions in it; you must get yourselves disbanded before I have any Thing to say to ye: But abstain from Cruelty, Oppression, and Mutiny, unto which Vices Soldiers are often but too prone—And our blessed Lord himself, we find, did not rebuke the <HI>Centurion</HI> and other Soldiers, because they were in that Employment, but rather declared not to have found so great Faith, no, not in <HI>Israel,</HI> as in one of the Military Order—Saint <HI>Peter</HI> also, being by the holy Spirit sent to <HI>Cornelius,</HI> the devout <HI>Centurion,</HI> saith not, throw up thy Commission of the Band called the <HI>Italian:</HI> But instructs him and his Family, in the Way of Salvation; and I doubt not in the least, but for all the Lessons Saint <HI>Peter</HI> gave him, he was the better Officer—Our Lord indeed, as is right, strongly forbids, private Resentment, pri∣vate Pique and Duelling For in the private Wrongs we receive, we neither can nor ought to be our own Judges nor Avengers; but must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave it to God, and to the Magistracy, in this respect his Vicegerent, to do us Justice—But that his People, in a just Cause, may not fight his Battles, he saith not.—</P>
<P>Seeing now Wars and Rumors of Wars are such ter∣rible Things, and sometimes very necessary and una∣voidable, the Lord Jesus exhorts his Disciples to good Courage and godly Heroism. <HI>See that ye be not troubled,</HI> saith he; which is the second Thing to be considered in the Text.</P>
<P>Which doth then imply, that such is the Complexion
<PB N="17" REF="007421_0009_102D83F4C7E5CE08"/>
of human Nature, as to have a Propensity to be troubled thereat—Wars put us to Jeopardy of our Lives, and are often a Means of Death—Nothing is dearer to a Man than his Life; and Death is the King of Terrors to hu∣man Nature—So that if ever Satan spoke the Truth, it was in this; Skin for Skin, yea, all that a Man hath, will he give for his Life—Some live in the Enjoyment of Things in this Life, so pleasing to them, and so much according to their Wish, that parting from it is a very melancholly Reflection—And they know very well Death deals so arbitrarily, that he minds not that at all; but for the most Part is so cruel, as to seize those first who have the greatest Desire to live longer—The young and the gay, the rich, the great and the noble, and especi∣ally such as by an unexpected Turn of Things, have been raised to a particular Degree of Happiness, such as it is, in this vain and transitory World, he preys upon with insatiable Voracity—Others, who, notwithstanding they value the Enjoyments of Life little, are yet struck with Terror by the dire and ghastly Aspect of Death, for which, by the Weakness and Imbecillity of their Minds, they have a natural Dread and Abhorrence— Others again, who perhaps for themselves, fear Death as little as they value Life, and care little whether they swim or sink, live or die, have beloved Relations, tender Pledges of Love and Affection, which to bid so long an Adieu, is worse than Death—Here is one Wedlock-bound to a loving Wife, the Delight of his Life, a Relation so dear and tender, that the divine Law-giver saith, when a Man hath taken a new Wife, he shall not go out to War, neither shall he be charged with any Business: But he shall be free at Home one Year, and shall cheer up his Wife which he hath taken; or perhaps he hath betrothed a Woman, and hath not taken her, or built a new House, or planted a Vineyard: There is another, who besides, is blest with many Children, that can so ill spare him: A third perhaps, hath the Care and Support
<PB N="18" REF="007421_0010_102D83F70A37FB68"/>
of an aged Parent, a Father, or a Mother, or both. A fourth perhaps, all these at once. A fifth peradventure, hath neither of these, and yet by Ties of Love and Af∣fection, such as there was in <HI>Jacob</HI> towards <HI>Rachel,</HI> or such fraternal Amity as subsisted between <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> he may be very much troubled at the griesly Aspect of Death, (often so cruel as to take the one and leave the other behind) at least more than otherwise he should be—Besides all this, Wars do not only threaten us with Death, but also endanger our Bodies to be man∣gled and maimed: We are in Jeopardy of losing Mem∣bers of our Bodies by them; the hairy Scalp, the Crown of our Heads, an Eye, an Arm, a Leg, and so forth; and thus be constrained to suffer the Mortification of seeing and feeling ourselves die by Piece-Meals; we may be taken Captive, be abused, tortured and cruelly treated. —We may moreover see dear Relations die or suffer extremely; Wives and Daughters, Sisters and Virgins are sometimes ravished, and otherwise abused. Children butchered like innocent Lambs, destinated to the Slaugh∣ter; tender Babes and suckling Infants, torn from their Mothers Breasts, and dashed against the Stones;—anci∣ent Parents dragged by their hoary Hairs, and stabbed to the Heart—Our Habitations consumed by Fire, and all our Effects ruined and destroyed:—Our Land, Cities and Towns taken from us, and possessed by the Enemy, while we ourselves are left destitute and forlorn—Nay, by Wars we may be despoiled of our inestimable reli∣gious and civil Liberties, and be constrained to spend our Days under Tyranny and Persecution, Bondage and Servitude; Error, Heresy, Idolatry, Superstition and Thraldom—Yea, Wars are often accompanied by a long Train and Retinue of malignant Diseases and con∣tagious Distempers, and may end in Famine and Pesti∣lence—All these Evils, and many more too long to enu∣merate, we may suffer by Wars.—</P>
<P>And notwithstanding all this (and more than I have
<PB N="19" REF="007421_0010_102D83F70A37FB68"/>
said, or can say) we are commanded and charged by our blessed Lord, to see that we be not troubled:—We must keep up our drooping Spirits; we must have good Courage, and be inspired with godly Heroism.—We must see that we put our Trust in God, and fly to him for Refuge and Succour; that we put ourselves in a Posture of Defence, and then fight the Battles of the Lord valiantly—Submitting the whole to his Disposal.—</P>
<P>We must see to it, that our Cause be just and good. We are not to engage in War from Motives of Lust, from Principles of Pride, Ambition, Rapacity, Cruelty, Covetousness or vain Glory. This would be espousing the Cause of the Devil, the Destroyer and Murderer of Mankind—But for our Lives, our Liberties, our Pro∣perties, and our most holy Religion.—When wicked Men will rob us of those Blessings, the Lord hath been pleased to bestow upon us, then is our Cause a just one, and becomes God's Cause, unto whom we may safely appeal to decide the Controversy, as did <HI>Jephthah</HI> the <HI>Gileadite,</HI> when he was constrained to engage in a War, against the King of the Children of <HI>Ammon;</HI> so now, saith he, the Lord God of <HI>Israel,</HI> hath dispossessed the <HI>Amorites</HI> from before his People <HI>Israel,</HI> and shouldest thou possess it? Wilt not thou possess that which <HI>Chemosh</HI> thy God giveth thee to possess? So whomsoever the Lord our God shall drive out from before us, them will we possess.—Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me wrong to War against me: The Lord the Judge, be Judge this Day between the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> and the Children of <HI>Ammon.</HI></P>
<P>We must see to it, that in our Wars we engage in the Name of the Lord—In the Name of our God we must set up our Banners—And above all Things, we must enlist-under <HI>Emmanuel</HI>'s Banner for spiritual Warfare, that we may have Peace with God, and be in his Favour; that whether we live, or whether we die, we may be the Lord's.—We must begin, carry on, and end our Wars
<PB N="20" REF="007421_0011_102D83F8A098A678"/>
with God, and not with Belial—We must implore his Approbation, his Aid, his Blessing and Succour, to our Enterprise, whom <HI>Moses</HI> his faithful Servant besought; if thy Presence go not with me, carry us not up hence— Let us Remember what <HI>Samuel</HI> did, when all <HI>Israel</HI> was penitently gathered together at <HI>Mizpeh,</HI> imploring Heaven for Deliverance from the Hands of the <HI>Philistins; Sa∣muel</HI> cried unto the Lord, for <HI>Israel,</HI> and the Lord heard him: And the Lord thundered with a great Thunder, on that Day, upon the <HI>Philistins,</HI> and discomfited them; and they were smitten before <HI>Israel:</HI> So that <HI>Samuel</HI> had Reason to erect a Monument Stone, calling it <HI>Ebenezer,</HI> hitherto hath the Lord helped us—And thou pious King <HI>Hezekiah,</HI> though thou hadst thy Failings and Weakness, art an Example of Imitation unto us, in thy Prayer, which, out of the Fulness of thy Heart, thou didst send up to Heaven, when <HI>Sennacherib</HI> besieged <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> and <HI>Rabshakeh</HI> reproached the living God! then didst thou pray, O Lord God of <HI>Israel,</HI> who dwellest between the Cherubim, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the Kingdoms of the Earth, thou hast made Heaven and Earth. Now, therefore, O Lord our God, I beseech thee, save thou us out of his Hand, that all the King∣doms of the Earth may know that thou art the Lord God, even thou only.—And behold God's gracious Answer of this Prayer: And it came to pass that Night, that the Angel of the Lord went out, and smote in the Camp of the <HI>Assyrians,</HI> an Hundred and Fourscore and five Thousand: And when they arose early in the Morn∣ing, behold, they were all dead Corpse.—</P>
<P>We must see to it, that we put ourselves in a proper Posture for War—We must not be as <HI>Laish,</HI> that lieth in the Valley of <HI>Bethrehob,</HI> a People that dwelt careless, after the Manner of the <HI>Sydonians,</HI> quiet and secure, where there was no Magistrate in the Land, that might put them to shame in any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> We must fortify our Towns and Cities, we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and Citadels,
<PB N="21" REF="007421_0011_102D83F8A098A678"/>
Towers and Castles, and strong Holds of Defence—We must Watch and Ward, and be upon our Guard. We must sound an Alarm, when required, with the mart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Trumpet, and gather our Forces together as one M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, from <HI>Dan</HI> even unto <HI>Bersheba</HI>—We must cry, <HI>to Arms! to Arms! Arm Warriors, arm!</HI></P>
<P>We must indeed see to it, that we act with Prudence<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Caution and Circumspection; and not rush into the B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣tle with stupid Rashness; worse than a Horse, a Mule, or an Elephant would do. Lions, Bears and Tygers, in catching their Prey, seem to act with some Forecast<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> what then should not rational Creatures do? Consulta∣tions and Councils of War are to be held, Advice is to be taken, Matters are to be deliberated upon, good Schemes are to be concerted, and Affairs are to be wisely managed.—The Strength and Situation of the Enemy is to be reconnoitred and spied out, if it may be done, when, and at what Place, it will be best to set Battle in Array against them, or how we may avoid being annoyed by them.—Let us not be too vain of our own Strength and Force, nor think too mean of our Adversaries, it will create Indolence and Negligence, and put us off of our Guard and Duty; far be from us, all Manner of Vaunt∣ing and idle Presumption: He, that girdeth on his Ar∣mour, and Harness, let him not boast as he that layeth it off.—But then, at the same Time, there must be good Courage and Resolution, Activity, Magnanimity, For∣titude, Faith and Trust in God, and in his eternal high Decree; chief Ingredients in Heroism! <Q>Pusilanimity and Cowardice, <HI>saith an ingenious Author,</HI> retards every Thing, obstructs every Design, and gains no Point; and although there be the best Schemes under Heaven, laid for Success against the Enemy, and gaining the Conquest over them; yet, if the Army, or those that lead forth the Host, be Men of no Courage, and do no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> prosecute and carry forward <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e well-laid Schemes, all turns out to be nothing. Alas! How many Ar∣mies
<PB N="22" REF="007421_0012_102D83FC94CCEBB0"/>
have been routed! How many Thousands of Mens Lives lost! And how many Expeditions en∣tirely frustrated! Because such as were to head the Army, have been timorous and wanted Courage; were afraid to fight; or perhaps worse, were deceitful and treacherous.—Scripture History informs us, how many that have wanted Courage have fled before the Enemy; but then what noble Feats doth it tell us, such have done, who have been Men of Courage and good Spirit! How did the Heroes in the <HI>Israelitish</HI> Nation, driv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t their Enemies before them, subdue strong and potent Kingdoms, and possess their Territories after them.</Q>—</P>
<P>We must see to it, that we refer the Issue wholly to the Supreme Being, firmly believing that an omnipotent, infinitely wise, good and righteous God, over-rules all Events, according to his own good Pleasure, submitting ourselves to his sovereign Disposal, as <HI>Job</HI> exhorted the Army of the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> when they were sore beset on all Hands; be of good Courage, and let us behave ourselves valiently for our People, and for the Cities of our God; and let the Lord do that which is good in his Sight.—If we are conquered, we must say, the Will of the Lord be done; if we conquer and overcome, we must give the Glory to God.—</P>
<P>And all this for a good and sufficient Reason; because, all these Things are ordained and decreed, so to be, and so to happen, before the End of the World come, as in the third and latter Part of the Text; <HI>for all these Things must come to pass.</HI>—Such is the eternal, the irre∣vokable and irreversible Decree of Heaven—And what∣soever is decreed in Heaven, will not remain pendent in the Clouds—Such is the Will of the eternal Father, unto whom all his Works are known from Eternity, who hath concerted the whole Scheme, and laid the Plan of the Universe: And his Will must be done on Earth, as it is in Heaven.—All Things are decreed by God, and the whole of our Fate is ordained by him, and it
<PB N="23" REF="007421_0012_102D83FC94CCEBB0"/>
shall happen unto us as he hath decreed it.—We must with patient <HI>Job,</HI> confess, Lord-our Days are determined, the Number of our Months are with thee, thou hast appointed our Bounds, which we cannot pass.—We must say, the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away, blessed be the Name of the Lord:—Let him bring upon me that which is appointed for me! We must deny our∣selves, take up our Cross, and follow Jesus.—We must even lose our own Lives in ourselves, that we may find them in God.—This is godly Heroism and spiritual Warfare, by which we conquer ourselves, and all the Powers of Hell and of this World; and whereby we are of a Truth rendered capable to fight the Battles of the Lord of Sabaoth. <HI>Fortior est qui se quam qui fortissima vincit Moenia, nec Virtus altior ire potest.</HI>—He who conquers himself, is stronger than he that conquers the strongest Walls, and Virtue can go no higher.—</P>
<P>We must then, as rational Creatures, be earnestly engaged in the Use of all good and lawful Means, which the Lord hath been pleased to put in our Way, to pro∣mote our Happiness, in this and in the eternal World: But at the same Time submit, with an holy Complacency in the just and good Will of God, to all that he hath decreed over us.—Whether we sink or whether we swim, whether the Lord kills us, or whether he preserves us alive, when we are in a Way of dutiful Obedience to him, it must be Matter of holy Indifference to us, what∣soever be his Disposal.—</P>
<P>Human Nature, alas! in its lapsed State, is but too prone to murmur and cavil at the Dispensations of God's Providence. Godly <HI>Asaph,</HI> when he saw the Prosperity of Fools, and reflected on the Adversities of the Wise and Pious, breaks forth into Complaint: But as for me, my Feet were almost gone: My Steps had well nigh slipt: For I was envious at the Foolish, when I saw the Prosperity of the Wicked.—But at length, when he went into the Sanctuary of God, and saw the End, his
<PB N="24" REF="007421_0013_102D83FE2D7B5B38"/>
Mind became serene and calm, and his whole Soul wrapt up in an Extasy of Devotion, chusing God for the only and eternal Portion of his Soul, and entrusting his all with him.—</P>
<P>While it hath been my Business to see the Visions of the Almighty, I have seen horrible Sights.—I have seen Impiety and Oppression successful; Innocence I have seen oppressed and abused. Those who feared the Lord, and eschewed Evil, I have seen agonizing under Afflic∣tion upon Affliction, while at the same Time, such as had not the Fear of God before their Eyes, nor his Great∣ness upon their Hearts, were elevated with Prosperity.— The wicked and ungodly I have seen raised to Wealth and Honour, to Posts and Profits, while the sincere Worshipper of the Deity, was as a despised Lamp, as one mocked of his Neighbour, and laughed to scorn.— Such as were a Burthen to the World, I have seen con∣tinued beyond the common Period pf Life, and such as seemed a Blessing; even Stars of the first Magnitude, I have seen taken away by Death out of their Spheres, in the bright Morning of Youth.</P>
<P>All these Things, and worse than these, mine Eyes have seen, mine Ears have heard, and I myself have felt. <HI>Queque ipse miserrima vidi, quorum magna Pars fui.</HI> —Notwithstanding, do I <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay my Hand upon my Mouth, and am silent; I acquiesce in the eternal high Decree of Heaven; I submit with Patience and Resignation, to the all over-ruling irresistable Providence of God: From which, as soon as I do but in the least depart, I am lost in inextricable Labyrinths, and find myself entangled in ten Thousand Mazes; I plunge from Deep to deeper still, without reaching any Bottom; I am whirled round, without ever coming to the Center of the Whirlpool— But when I rowl myself over upon the Rock of Ages, my Soul returneth again unto its Rest.</P>
<Q><L>— And if by Prayer</L>
<L>Incessant, I could hope to change the Will —</L>
<L><PB N="25" REF="007421_0013_102D83FE2D7B5B38"/>Of him, who all Things can, I would not cease</L>
<L>To weary him with my assiduous Cries:</L>
<L>But Prayer against his absolute Decree</L>
<L>No more avails, than Breath against the Wind,</L>
<L>Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth:</L>
<L>Therefore to his great Bidding I submit.</L></Q>
<P>Although now this holy Submission to the Will and Decree of Heaven, be what our Dependence upon the Supreme Being makes our Duty, yet is there another weighty Reason for it, <HI>to wit,</HI> our own Advantage: For if we do not submit ourselves to the Disposal of Heaven, it will not take away our Adversities and Ca∣lamities, but rather increase them; for then we are con∣strained to bear both the Evil and the Murmurings of our Minds against it, which is a double Evil; whereas if our Souls are inspired with Resignation to, and Com∣placency in the Will of God, we have at worst, no more to suffer than one bare Evil; nay, scarce any Evil at all, that divine Frame of godly Heroism changing Evil into Good; so that were it possible one inspired therewith, should be ever in the Place where the damned suffer ever∣lasting Torments, it would make that Hell a Heaven to him.—</P>
<P>Moreover, we often see, how those, that with godly Heroism resign themselves to the Disposal of Heaven, are remarkably preserved and delivered by his marvellous Providence, while others behaving with the most abject Pusilanimity, and inglorious Timidity, have perished.— Persevering <HI>Joseph,</HI> the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> who would rather hazard his Life, than pollute his Conscience, how was he from the Dungeon, exalted to Honour and Dominion, while the King's Baker was hanged betwixt Heaven and Earth! Heroic <HI>David,</HI> how didst thou in thy great Distress, when thy temporal all was taken Captive, and thy own People spake of stoning thee, encourage thyself in the Lord thy God, and obtain marvellous Conquest and surprising Victory over thine Enemies! But, poor <HI>Saul,</HI> who was
<PB N="26" REF="007421_0014_102D84003AA21220"/>
wont to be victorious when he trusted in God, how doth he now, when he was forsaken of God, and had with, Fear and great Dismay, consulted the Sorceress at <HI>Endor,</HI> fall upon Mount <HI>Gilboa,</HI> as if he had not been anointed with Oil! Ye leprous <HI>Samaritans,</HI> who ventured out into the <HI>Syrian</HI> Camp, saying, Why sit we here until we die? If they save us alive we shall live; and if they kill us, we shall but die; how were ye, when ye returned, Pro∣claimers of good Tidings! But that wretched Lord, or Minister of State, on whose Hand the King leaned, who said to the Man of God, Behold, if the Lord would make Windows in Heaven, might this Thing be; how was he by the People, trod upon in the Gate that he died, seeing but not enjoying what he at first would not believe, though foretold him by a Man of God!</P>
<P>There is yet at last, one great Comfort in the Text, for the People of God, which is this; <HI>But the End is not yet.</HI>—Although it be the general Fate of the World, to be molested by Wars and Rumors of Wars; yet shall there, before the End be, come a glorious State of the Church, in which shall dwell Peace, Joy and Rest, for the People of God: When <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles</HI> shall be one People, rejoicing every where in the Salvation of the Lord; for his Name shall be great, from the rising of the Sun, unto the going down of the same, and every where shall Incense be offered, and a pure Offering.— The Fulness of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> shall come in, and all <HI>Israel</HI> be saved.—Antichrist shall fall, so that the Nations shout with Joy, she is fallen, she is fallen, <HI>Babylon</HI> that great City.—Satan the old Serpent, shall be bound a Thousand Years, that he deceive not the Nations.—Then will <HI>Jerusalem</HI> the beloved City, be the peaceable Habitation of the Saints of both <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> while our glorious Redeemer sways his Sceptre over all.—<HI>Gog</HI> and <HI>Magog,</HI> will indeed, when Satan is to be losed a little while, with innumerable Numbers, compass and besiege the Camp of the Saints, and the beloved City: But Fire will come
<PB N="27" REF="007421_0014_102D84003AA21220"/>
down from God out of Heaven, and devour them.— This Millennium of Peace, Joy and Rest to the Church militant, is a great Consolation to the People of God:— And it must certainly come before the End be; for while we hear of Wars and Rumors of Wars, the End is not yet: There must be a Thousand Years of Peace, a Sab∣bath of Rest, before the End come.—</P>
<P>Nothing is more certain, than that the End of the World shall come, but the precise Time when it is to be, is as uncertain.—Of that Day and Hour, knoweth no Man; no, not the Angels of Heaven.—Some have thought the World is to stand six Thousand Years: Two Thousand Years before the Law-giving, two Thou∣sand under the Law, and two Thousand under the Gospel.—It hath been about two Thousand Years before the Law was given in Form, and from thence to the Gospel Dispensation, also about two Thousand Years; but I think, if we endeavour to pry into the Gloom of sacred Prophecy, it will appear probable, from the great Things that must yet come to pass, that the World is to stand two Thousand Years under the Gospel, before the glorious State of the Church come; which is to con∣tinue a Thousand Years, and makes three Thousand Years under the Gospel; in the whole, seven Thousand Years of the World's standing.—After this there is to ensue a Period of Time of universal Defection and Apos∣tasy, when the World shall be as much sunk in Irreligion, Impiety and Sensuality, as in the Days of <HI>Noah,</HI> when the Deluge over whelmed the World; so that the Son of Man, when he cometh to judge the Quick and the Dead, shall scarce find Faith on Earth.—But how long this Time of Apostasy will last, no one of God's Creatures can tell.—</P>
<P>As of old, the World passed through the Water, so is it, in the last Conflagration and Consummation of all Things, to pass through the Fire, as Saint <HI>Peter</HI> saith; the Heavens shall pass away with a great Noise, and the
<PB N="28" REF="007421_0015_102D8403ACF82178"/>
Elements shall melt with fervent Heat; the Earth also, and the Works that are therein, shall be burnt up.—But whence this Fire is to proceed, we know not.—Some think it is to be done by the elementary Fire that sur∣rounds our Globe; others think, the Earth will be re∣moved out of her Center, and be swallowed up by the Sun, that vast Ocean and Furnace of Fire: Others more plausibly think, there is a fiery Constellation, which in its Course is to meet our terraqeous Globe, through which the Earth is to pass, in order to be purified by Fire.— How uncertain soever these Conjectures may be, this is certain, that the Consummation of this World, is to be by Conflagration; which is not to annihilate, but to purify and to renew it, as Saint <HI>Peter</HI> saith also, never∣theless we, according to his Promise, look for new Hea∣vens and a new Earth, wherein dwelleth Righteousness. —How then the Constitution of the Earth will be, I am at a Loss to tell, but that it shall be as the Garden of God, even as <HI>Eden,</HI> a Paradise, I doubt not in the least. —The wicked shall then be cast away into everlasting Fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels.—And the Saints shall enter into Life eternal.</P>
<P>And at last, it must be Matter of Consolation exceed∣ing great to the Saints, that their Existence is not to end with their Tribulations; but that there remaineth a Rest for the People of God, in the other World, in the ce∣lestial ever blessed Paradise.—Their Tribulations will not last always, but shall soon have an End; and their Peace and Joy, exceeding full of Glory, shall endure for ever, in the Kingdom of their Father.</P>
<P>So ye see, my dear Hearers, I have laid open and un∣folded to you, as well as the Lord hath granted me Ut∣terance, the Fate of the World, as predicted by our Lord, to the Encouragement of all those that Love him to the End of Days.—I have held forth to you the high Decree of Heaven, as much as it was permitted to me his Creature.—I proceed now to make some Application
<PB N="29" REF="007421_0015_102D8403ACF82178"/>
and Exhortation, on Occasion of this Expedition, for removing the Encroachments the <HI>French,</HI> our Antichri∣stian Neighbours and great Enemies, have made on our Borders.—</P>
<P>The Words of our Lord, Ye shall hear of Wars and Rumors of Wars, are now verified among us.—The <HI>French</HI> King, and Court, seem to be much bent on ag∣grandizing their Monarchy, that nothing can satiate their unbounded Ambition, or prescribe Limits to their enterprizing Disposition, than universal Empire on Earth; and perhaps not that neither. It may be, if they had made a Conquest of the whole World, they would wish for more Worlds to conquer also. <HI>Quid non mortalia Pectora cogis Auri sacra Fames?</HI>—This worse than enter∣prising Genius in the <HI>French,</HI> was the Source of their late Wars in <HI>Europe</HI> and in <HI>America;</HI> in which notwith∣standing, they were remarkably frustrated and baffled: <HI>Louisburgh,</HI> at <HI>Cape-Breton,</HI> was taken from them, and their Navy went to Wreck.— But as they who have an Enterprize much at Heart, are not discouraged by one Disappointment, having when one Project miscarries, another in Embryo; so the <HI>French,</HI> considering the In∣terest they had apparently obtained among the <HI>Indian</HI> Nations in <HI>North-America,</HI> have now transferred the Scene of War from <HI>Europe</HI> to us, hoping to accomplish in the New-found World, what in the old, they could not. They have then since the Proclamation of the late Peace, discovered a particular Inclination to encroach upon our Borders.—His Majesty King GEORGE, our most gra∣cious Sovereign, always taking tender Care of the Con∣cerns of his liege, loyal and loving Subjects, was gra∣ciously pleased, having the Interest of his Dominions in <HI>America</HI> much at Heart, to send the Earl of <HI>Albemarle,</HI> and Governor <HI>Shirley,</HI> in an Embassage to <HI>France,</HI> to settle the Boundaries between the two contending Nations in <HI>North-America:</HI> But by the Prevarications and Dissimu∣lations of the <HI>French,</HI> their Negociations were rendered
<PB N="30" REF="007421_0016_102D8406425B8400"/>
abortive.—Whereon the <HI>French</HI> seized, and began to fortify the Lands along the <HI>Ohio,</HI> refusing to withdraw their Forces from thence, when in his Majesty's Name, they were charged so to do by the Governor of <HI>Virginia.</HI> —This (as it ought to do) alarmed our Colonies ex∣ceedingly, and Commissioners from several Governments were sent to <HI>Albany,</HI> to consult, what was to be done in this Emergency; at which Congress, I believe (though I am not privy to these State Affairs) a Union or Alliance was struck between the several Governments, to join in endeavouring to remove the <HI>French</HI> from their Encroach∣ments on his Majesty's Dominions. The Result of which Confederacy, I believe, is the present Expedition.—The <HI>French,</HI> to prevent us, I suppose, from sending any Forces to <HI>Ohio,</HI> stimulated their <HI>Indians</HI> to do Mischief in some of our Governments, by cutting off the greatest Part of <HI>Hosac,</HI> and by killing, scalping, and captivating some People, hereabouts, and in <HI>New-England:</HI> And by Conspiracy (as the Report goes) perhaps to prevent <HI>Bri∣tain</HI> from sending Forces to <HI>America,</HI> threatned her with an Invasion.—But as the Lord often takes the Crafty in their own Devices, so have all these Doings of the <HI>French</HI> greatly tended to our awakening.—At Home, a great Armada is prepared; and his Majesty hath sent General <HI>Braddock</HI> abroad, with an Army to the <HI>Ohio,</HI> there, if it please God, to dislodge the <HI>French</HI> in the <HI>Southward.</HI>— Colonel <HI>Winslow,</HI> with an Army of <HI>New-England</HI> Heroes, is engaged to drive the <HI>French</HI> from their Encroachments in the <HI>East,</HI> and to bring the treacherous Neutrals to Terms of good Behaviour.—General <HI>Pepperell</HI> (so say the public Prints) intends with an Army <HI>Northeastward,</HI> to <HI>Kenebec River,</HI> and farther into <HI>Canada.</HI>—In our se∣veral Governments, Forces have been raised, some under the Command of his Excellency General <HI>Shirley,</HI> to act their Part in the <HI>Westward,</HI> on Lake <HI>Ontario</HI> and at <HI>Nia∣gara.</HI>—Others, under Command of Major General <HI>John∣son,</HI> and Major General <HI>Lyman,</HI> to remove Encroach∣ments
<PB N="31" REF="007421_0016_102D8406425B8400"/>
in the <HI>North,</HI> at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> that fatal Place.—</P>
<P>Our Affairs, my dear Friends and Brethren, are come to a high Crisis! The whole of the Land, the Lord our God, hath been pleased to give us, seems at present to hang in an awful Balance.—If Matters go for us, it may be well with us; but if they go against us, Wo! Wo unto us!—The Idea I have of the Consequence of our present Enterprize, against our Antichristian unjustly en∣croaching Neighbours, is such, that I want Words to set it off.—Our Cause is a just and a good Cause, and what, by the Providence of Heaven, we are called, we are constrained unto.—For my Part, I would chearfully venture in it the last Drop of Blood that flows in my Veins <HI>(Dulce et decorum est pro Patria mori)</HI> and should neither have wanted Resolution nor Inclination to engage in fighting the Battles of the Lord, against our Antichri∣stian Enemies and their Barbarians, were not my Sphere of Action circumscribed by the pastoral Office in the Church of God, and by the Care of Souls.—But although thereby my Hands are bound, my Heart, my Tongue and Pen is not.—I am desirous in my Sphere, to serve my God, my King, and Country, every Way I can, and would willingly contribute my Mite towards our great Enterprize of removing the <HI>French</HI> Encroachments. —I do therefore in the Name of the Lord, exhort, be∣seach, pray, obtest and conjure our whole <HI>Israel,</HI> from <HI>Dan</HI> even unto <HI>Bersheba,</HI> that while we hear of Wars and Rumors of Wars, we be not troubled thereat, whereas all these Things must come to pass, and the End is not yet; but be inspired with good Courage and godly Heroism.—</P>
<P>Let us consider how just our Cause is, and how neces∣sary, that we exert ourselves against our encroaching Neighbours.—Hath not the Lord, by his Providence, directed us to the first Discovery, and the first Possession of this Land?—Not to speak of the Discovery and Set∣tlement probably made in <HI>America,</HI> by <HI>Madock,</HI> Prince

of <HI>Whales;</HI> did not <HI>John Cabot,</HI> very early, at least before the <HI>French</HI> did, discover <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> and his Son <HI>Sebastian,</HI> all the Coast from <HI>Newfoundland</HI> to <HI>Florida?</HI> Did not Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> in the Reign of Queen <HI>Eli∣zabeth,</HI> of blessed Memory, take Possession in <HI>America</HI> on this Side of the Continent? And did he not sail into the <HI>South Sea,</HI> on the other Side of the Main, and there re∣ceive a Surrender of <HI>California,</HI> from the King of the Country? And did he not take Possession in the Queen's Name? Did not the <HI>Dutch</HI> surrender and c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>de to the <HI>English, New-York,</HI> and Part of <HI>New-Jersey?</HI> Did not a pious People in <HI>Britain,</HI> so zealous for their God, that they fled from their Native Country, into these wild De∣sarts, in order to enjoy the Liberty of worshipping their God in Spirit and in Truth, settle in <HI>New-England?</HI> Did not God give the Land of the Heathen unto them? And was it not granted unto them by Royal Charter, East and West, from Sea to Sea, from the Atlantic Ocean to the South Sea, provided only such Part as might be in the Possession of any Christian State or Po∣tentate, of which there were none, except only the <HI>Dutch,</HI> who ceded what they had to <HI>Great-Britain?</HI> Have not the <HI>Iroquois,</HI> or <HI>Six Nations,</HI> by most solemn Treaties, been acknowledged to be under the Protection of the <HI>English,</HI> and their Claim to that Country yielded? Is it now lawful for the <HI>French</HI> to come creeping in between us? Notwithstanding all these Things, have the <HI>French</HI> these many Years been making Encroachments upon us. What else is the Fort at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> that fatal Place? And several others in the <HI>North-eastward,</HI> and in the <HI>Westward,</HI> on Lake <HI>Ontario</HI> and <HI>Erie?</HI> Have they not in Time of profound Peace, broken through solemn Treaties and Covenants, and built three Forts on the Lands along the <HI>Ohio,</HI> thereby to annoy our Settlements, employing their <HI>Indians,</HI> those Blood-hounds, in plun∣dering, murdering, scalping and captivating us, on all our Frontiers?—They have already shed the innocent
<PB N="33" REF="007421_0017_102D8409D6026258"/>
Blood of our People along the <HI>Ohio,</HI> in <HI>Washington</HI>'s De∣feat.—Last Summer, without any Provocation in these Northern Parts, they have cut off and burnt the greatest Part of <HI>Hosac</HI> and <HI>Sinkhaie,</HI> and have murdered, scalped, and taken Captive several of our People.—Although now this hath been chiefly perpetrated by <HI>Indians,</HI> it is not∣withstanding evident, it proceeds from the Instigation of the <HI>French.</HI> And must we suffer those most inhuman Bar∣barians, those Griffins of Prey, to bathe their Clutches in innocent Blood, without taking Vengeance on them? Must they with Impunity, snatch away our People in ig∣nominious Captivity, and having abused them with all the Barbarity they are Masters of, arrogantly demand a Sum of Money for their Ransom, sufficient to buy them a Negro or Slave? O just Heaven, do thou assume our Cause against them! The Groans and Cries, the dying Convulsions of our unhappy suffering Innocents, have been heard and seen by thee, from whom nothing is hid; O Almighty Lord! Suffer this no longer, we beseech thee, take thou Vengeance on them!</P>
<P>By what we have already seen and felt of the Mal∣treatment and Oppression, the Violence and Cruelty of our Antichristian Neighbours, and their Barbarians, we may judge, what they would do, if we permit them to go on; and if we were unsuccessful in our present Ex∣pedition, for removing their Encroachments, boundless and uncontroulable would be their Insolence; let us pursue them, would they say, to the Ends of the Earth; at least, let us never stop until we have driven those Hugonots, those pestilent Hereticks, clear off from the Continent of <HI>America.</HI>—In vain did we seek universal Empire over the whole Earth, by Wars in <HI>Europe;</HI> it is to be obtained on this Side of the Atlantic Ocean.—We must transport as many of our People as we can, from <HI>France,</HI> and by them set the <HI>English</HI> adri<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t; then are we in Possession of a spacious, of a fruitful Land, wherein there is no good Thing wanting that is upon the Earth,
<PB N="34" REF="007421_0018_102D840BEF59A888"/>
in which, when we have been once settled a little while, we will push our good Fortune farther, (for the Northren Nations have always been an Over-match for the Southern) and play the same Trick upon the lazy and indolent <HI>Spa∣niards,</HI> we have done upon the <HI>English,</HI> which will make us Masters, sole Masters, of the Silver and Gold Mines in <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Mexico;</HI> and if we once get them, the whole World is ours.</P>
<P>This, it is likely, would be their Scheme; when our Condition would be woful indeed. We must then either die, or submit to Servitude and Tyranny, to Idolatry, Superstition and Thraldom, far worse than the most cruel Death! Or must we transport ourselves, naked and forlorn, beyond the Ocean? Or in what in hospita∣ble Part of this Globe, shall we pitch our fugitive Tents, and lament with bitter Remembrance of our former State? Farewel now those fertile Lands; farewel those fruitful Fields; farewel ye fat Meadows, and fructiferous Vallies! Vales, Hills, Mountains, Woods, farewel! Farewel ye pleasant Rivers, ye populous Towns, farewel; farewel ye joyous Cities, goodly Possessions, farewel; adieu all!</P>
<P>And while we thus lament, will not <HI>Great-Britain</HI> have Reason to utter her mournful Complaint? Our Trade is lost and gone! Our floating Castles are no more, or at least no more a Match for those of our inveterate Ene∣mies! The cruel Fate of our Brethren, of our conquered Colonies in <HI>America,</HI> follows hard after us, and will e'er long overtake us. A free Kingdom built on the Rock of Liberty and of Right, must become subject to lawless and despotic Tyranny and arbitrary Thraldom, and thus sink into the Tomb, and moulder and crumble into Dust, out of which will only grow a Province of <HI>France;</HI> worse than which nothing can be conceived.—O! had we exerted our whole Strength in the Name of the Lord in due Time! Had we behaved as it became valiant <HI>Britons,</HI> it would be some Satisfaction <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> But alas! what aggravates our Misery, is, that we have forsaken our
<PB N="35" REF="007421_0018_102D840BEF59A888"/>
God, and that therefore we have been forsaken by him, so that our Eyes were struck with Blindness, our Hearts with Languor, and our Hands with Weakness.—Yea, all <HI>Europe</HI> shall fell the Consequence, and condole with us that the Balance is broke, and our friendly Allies swallowed up by the grand Monarchy.—The <HI>Dutch,</HI> the <HI>Germans,</HI> the <HI>Danes,</HI> and the Rest, are all inevitably to share our unhappy Fate.—Thus should <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and all her Allies complain.—</P>
<P>But let us also consider, how happy our Situation should be, if it pleased the Lord to crown our Enter∣prise, unto which we are constrained, with good Success: —If we, in the mean While, that there are only Rumors of War, remove the <HI>French</HI> Encroachments along the <HI>Ohio,</HI> on Lake <HI>Ontario</HI> and <HI>Erie,</HI> at <HI>Niagara,</HI> and at <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> that fatal Place; and then War should be declared at Home, and a Fleet sail up the River of <HI>St. Lawrence</HI> to attack <HI>Quebec,</HI> and our Armies march up by Land to <HI>Montreal,</HI> and farther into <HI>Canada,</HI> we may, with the Blessing of Heaven, do to the <HI>French</HI> what they thought to have done us; that is, drive them quite off from the Continent of <HI>America,</HI> (for when <HI>Quebec,</HI> the Root, is eradicated, the Trunk and Branches must fall of their own Accord) and until that happen, there can be no Peace in <HI>Jerusalem;</HI> unless the <HI>French</HI> change their Religion, their Policy and their Genius: No Wall of Stone, were it one of the Worlds prodigious Wonders, as that between <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Tartary,</HI> no unfordable Wa∣ters, profound Lakes and rapid Streams of Rivers, no insurpassable Alpian Mountains, and craggy Clifts of Rocks, and Promontories, no impenetrable Woods and wild Desarts, can be a sufficient Boundary between us: (As to Treaties and Covenants, they are their Sport.—) They and their Savages bent on Bloodshed, would wade, or sink or swim, and creep and leap through, and over all, to annoy us, and we should endeavour to be avenged on them for their Insolence.—And thus must we be kept
<PB N="36" REF="007421_0019_102D840DA6E8D0C0"/>
in continual Alarm, and at all Times have our Lives in our Hands; or being teized and worried out beyond Patience, quit the Land to them at length; which God forbid. <HI>(Delenda est Carthago.)</HI>—But were we so happy in our removing of Encroachments, as to remove the <HI>French</HI> quite out of <HI>North-America,</HI> then would we be blessed with an happy Situation, in a good Land, flow∣ing with Milk and Honey, abounding with every Ne∣cessary, and many Comforts (if such any earthly Thing can be) of Life.—Then would we be delivered of those most inhuman Barbarians, those Canibals, the preying, the murdering, and scalping <HI>Indians.</HI>—Then might we sit in Peace and Quietude under our Vine and Figtree.— No Reason should we have to envy the <HI>Spaniards</HI> of <HI>Peru</HI> and <HI>Mexico,</HI> their Gold and Silver Mines; we should get more than enough of that Dust, by Mortals dignified for the Produce of our own Country.—</P>
<P>There is something very much to our Encouragement, which is, that Antichrist must fall before the End come; and that there must be a peaceable and glorious Kingdom, or Hierarchy on Earth, a Thousand Years, when the Name of the Lord shall be great, from the risi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>g of the Sun, unto the going down of the same, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> and a pure Offering shall be offered every where <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> the Fulness of the <HI>Gentiles</HI> shall come in, and a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Israel</HI> be saved; all Nations of the Earth rejoycing in the Sal∣vation of the Lord: And Satan, the old Serpent, be bound, that he deceive not Mortals.—The <HI>French</HI> now adhere and belong to Antichrist, wherefore it is to be hoped, that when Antichrist falls, they shall fall with him.—It is moreover certain, that real Religion must yet flourish in <HI>America,</HI> in the glorious State of the Church; the <HI>French</HI> Religion is polluted with Idolatry, and therefore it is to be expected, that they either shall be converted or subdued.—</P>
<P>But as this makes for us, so is there also much against us: Our Sins and Abominations are exceeding great.—
<PB N="37" REF="007421_0019_102D840DA6E8D0C0"/>
What wicked and ungodly Principles; what Atheism and Infidelity; what Cursing and Swearing, and taking God's sacred Name in Vain; what Perjury and false Oaths; what Prophanation and Sabbath breaking; what Neglect of public and private Worship to the Supreme Being; what Debauchery and Uncleanness; what Whore∣dom and Adultery; what Theft and Injustice; what Vio∣lence and Oppression; what Lying, Slander, and Hatred and Malice; what Drunkenness, Luxury and Intem∣perance; what Pride and Haughtiness of Spirit; what Impenitence and Hardness of Heart; what Enmity against real and experimental Religion, doth not our Land groan under, in this Iron Age of Defection and Apostacy, which God will punish with Judgments from Heaven?</P>
<P>If we look into the History of Antiquity, and remark the Ways of God's Dealings with <HI>Israel,</HI> his favourite People of old, we shall find, the Dispensations of his Providence towards them were such, that when they loved and served their God, he gave them Victory over their Enemies; but when they polluted their Souls with the Abominations of the Heathens, they were left a Prey to their Adversaries, who butchered them as Brutes de∣stinated to the Slaughter, domineered and tyrannized over them.—Our Antichristian Neighbours, it is true, are as far remote from the Favour of Heaven, as we, and farther too, if possible; they worship Idols in a li∣teral Sense, and adore the Works of their own Hands; but so did the Nations also, that lead <HI>Israel</HI> captive. There is more expected of a Nation blessed with the Light of Truth, than from one groping in the Darkness of Ignorance, of Superstition and Idolatry.—O that we were wise! That we understood this! That we would consider our latter End! How should one chase a Thou∣sand, and two put ten Thousand to Flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?</P>
<P>Before then, my dear Hearers, I exhort you to the Enterprize ye are now going upon; I beseech, I pray,
<PB N="38" REF="007421_0020_102D8411A1EBD298"/>
and obtest you in the Name of the Lord, to renounce the Service of Sin and Satan, and to enlist for spiritual Warfare, under <HI>Emanuel</HI>'s Banner, against the Diabolians. —Seek an Interest in the blessed Redeemer.— Enter into that everlasting Covenant, which shall never be broken.—Make your Peace with God, and then ye need not be troubled.—Then will you be fit to live, and fit to die; and though ye die, ye shall live for ever.—Such of you as are really pious (of which I trust there are some, who have chosen God for the only and eternal Portion of their Souls) I expect will also make the best Warriors.—And what I have said once on another Oc∣casion, that had a near Connexion with this, I now speak again in the same Words:— <Q>Ungodly Sinners are the worst of Warriors.—And no Wonder! The Ter∣ror of the Lord seizes impious Men: When Death is before their Eyes, the World of Spirits then open to their View, overshadows their Souls with gloomy Ap∣prehensions, foreboding the Blackness of Darkness for ever. Infernal Vultures of Prey hover over their Heads, to snatch away their guilty Souls to doleful Shades.—But there stands the Man, who firmly be∣lieves God's eternal Predestination; who doth wholly acquiesce in his irresistable high Decree, who hath made his Peace with God; Angel Guards attend him, to conduct his parting Spirit into the celestial ever blessed Paradise. See how intrepid he stands! Com∣posed as the Saint whose Errors are forgiven, glowing with heroic Enthusiasm. See how he marches up against the blazing Steel; Fire, Smoke and Thunder terrify him not: The fatal Lead whistles around his Head, without darting Panic into his Heart; his Breast being defended by a Shield of triple Adamant, is far more impregnable to the Terror, than to the Death of the hollow Engines; great, noble, and heroic Deeds are done by him.—Or is it that we look for Council of War, and high Exploit? Here will we find the
<PB N="39" REF="007421_0020_102D8411A1EBD298"/>
Saint to excell the Sinner; for the Fear of the Lord is the Beginning of Wisdom, as well as of Courage: Besides, the Saint is honest and loyal, and inspired with patriot Zeal; whereas the best that can be said of the irregenerate Sinner, is, where Mammon leads the Van, Belial will never fail to bring up the Rear.</Q></P>
<P>Come on then, my dear Friends, begin this Enter∣prize with the Lord, and not with Belial. Be ye in∣spired with good Courage and godly Heroism, to fight the Battles of the Lord; and the Lord of Sabaoth, the God of the Armies of <HI>Israel,</HI> shall be with you, to hold up your Faces, and to cover your Heads in the Day of Battle; to save and defend, to bless and to prosper you exceedingly.—He will send his holy Angels (those hea∣venly Hosts, who encamp round about the Tents of the faithful) to protect you, and to put your Adversa∣ries to Flight.—</P>
<P>And may the Lord of Hosts bless the Arms of his Majesty, our most gracious Sovereign, every where abun∣dantly! O would God grant General BRADDOCK, to be successful along the <HI>Ohio,</HI> from thence to expel the <HI>French</HI> entirely!—May Sir WILLIAM PEPPERRELL, (that Hero who hath heretofore been blessed with such signal Success in the Reduction of <HI>Cape-Breton</HI>) and Colonel WINSLOW, be exceeding prosperous in the <HI>North-eastward,</HI> against a Treacherous Enemy! May his Excellency General SHIR∣LEY, with the Forces at <HI>Oswego,</HI> remove the Encroach∣ments of our Adversaries, to good Purpose in the <HI>West,</HI> at <HI>Niagara</HI> and thereabouts, on Lake <HI>Ontario</HI> and <HI>Erie!</HI> —May this Army, commanded by Major General JOHNSON, and Major General LYMAN, be blessed from Heaven, with exceeding good Success against <HI>Crown-Point,</HI> that, fatal Place.—The Lord of Sabaoth be a Wall of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ire round about it, and a Glory in the Midst of it!</P>
<P>May ye, Gentlemen Officers, who have the Com∣mand in this Army, be valiant as <HI>David</HI>'s Heroes, and valiant Men! Be ye pious and fearing the Lord, as <HI>Cor∣nelius</HI>
<PB N="40" REF="007421_0021_102D8413425365E0"/>
the devout <HI>Centurion.</HI>—May ye be Men of God's right Hand, Workers of Justice and Righteousness, kind and examplary to your Soldiers, dear and precious to your Friends, victorious and terrible to your Enemies, loving Worshippers of the Deity, going forth in his Fear and Strength, returning triumphant with his Praises, beloved, preserved and blessed, by him with whom is the Fulness of all Blessings, in this and the eternal World.</P>
<P>My Brethren of the Clergy, ye Sons of <HI>Levi,</HI> who are a going up with this Army:—May ye see the Visions of the Almighty! His Urim and Thummim be with you. As <HI>Aaron</HI> and <HI>Hur,</HI> support ye and stay up, the Hands of <HI>Moses</HI> when they become heavy.—Be ye fer∣vent in Prayer, faithful in Exhortation.—When this Army goeth out to Battle, approach ye then and speak unto the People, in the Name of the Lord: Let not your Hearts faint, fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified: For the Lord your God, is he that goeth with you, to fight for you against your Enemies, to save you.—Above all, exhort them to spiritual Warfare under <HI>Emanuel</HI>'s Banner; they will make much the bet∣ter Soldiers for it.—And the Lord grant you to be In∣struments in his Hand, of saving many precious Souls, that shall be your Joy and Triumph in Glory!</P>
<P>Ye Doctors of Physic, be ye tender of the Health, of the Lives and Limbs of these our Friends and Brethren, that are going forth to fight the Battles of the Lord, for their King and Country, and for our most holy Religion. Caution them against every Thing that may be hurtful to their Healths, and may have a Tendency to bring on Indispositions, Diseases and Distempers to Body or Mind. —Apply faithfully the reviving Medicine, the assuaging Opiate, and the healing Balsam, to the Sick and Wounded.—It is indeed better to pluck out an Eye, to cut off a Limb and Member, than that the whole Body die, and rot and perish; yet are they not to be lopped off and destroyed, without the most absolute Necessity, and

the greatest Extremity.—Mortals so wretched and mi∣serable, that they can neither live nor die; that Priest and Levite can do no more than give them over to the Mercy of Heaven, are often the Objects of your Com∣miseration.—Neglect not, I beseech you, to treat them with Mercy; and a merciful God, the gracious Phy∣sician of Souls, reward you with everlasting Mercy.—</P>
<P>And now, all ye Warriors and Soldiers, be ye val∣liant as the Children of <HI>Israel.</HI>—Put your Trust in the Lord of Hosts, and not in your own Strength and Num∣bers.—Be ye Pious and Religious, as that devout Soldier, who waited continually on <HI>Cornelius</HI> the good <HI>Centurion.</HI>— Abhor that abominable Practice of impious Swearing, and of taking God's sacred Name in vain.—The Lord will not hold such guiltless; ye may thereby provoke Heaven to blast this Expedition: And should you even succeed, and return victorious, little Reason will your Country have to thank you, if you return Home, habitua∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed to a Vice of which others may catch the Contagion, and spread the Infection to such a Degree of Abomina∣tion, that just Heaven be incensed to send down a Storm of Vengeance on the whole Land.—As ye are yet, for the most Part, pretty well free of this horrid Vice, shun and avoid it, worse than you would do the evil Spirit.— Refrain ye from all Manner of Prophaneness and Im∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>iety.—Avoid hard Drinking: Be not drunk in strong Liquor, in Wine or in Rum, in which there is Excess; but be full of the Spirit.—Whatsoever is honourable, whatsoever is manly and becoming, whatsoever is good and just, that do ye.—Fortify your Minds with Reso∣lution, with Patience and Resignation, to do, and to suffer all that the Lord in his Providence requireth of you. —Enter into an everlasting Covenant with God; chuse him for the only and eternal Portion of your Souls; and surrender yourselves to him, Soul and Body, for Time and Eternity, so that ye be not your own, nor anothers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t his, the Lords, for ever.—You shall have many

Difficulties to encounter, and perhaps more than you are aware of — Your Army will be but unequally yoked with Unbelievers.—And it happens sometimes, that even the Righteous suffer in the Judgments God inflicts to punish the Ungodly.—Moreover, you are to deal with a barbarous, a cruel, a savage, a merciless Enemy; nay, an Enemy whose very Mercies are Cruelty, whose very Appearance is frightful, whose very Shouts and martial Cries, are enough to strike a Mind not well for∣tified, with Panic and Confusion.—Death, the King of Terrors, in all his ghastly and formidable Shapes, the World of Spirits, nay, almost a Resemblance of Hell, will be represented to your View, in a most horrible Drama, in a most terrible Scene.—But be ye not ter∣rified at all this; see that ye be not troubled, for all these Things must come to pass, but the End is not yet.—Be ye inspired with good Courage and godly Heroism, re∣signing yourselves in the Hands of the Lord, wholly ac∣quiescing in his eternal high Decree, be assured no Harm can befall you, but by Heaven's Permission: Every Ball and Iron Globe, that proceeds out of the Mouth of the Cannon, every Bomb from the Mortar, every Bullet out of the Musquet, every Sword out of the Sheath, i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> under his Direction; and must do just so much, and no more, than pleaseth him.— Should you then see the Cannons mortal Mouth, and the Mortars gaping wide upon you; should you hear it roar, and see it vomiting Fire and Flame, and perceive the Globes of hard <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>on, and of fatal Lead, as Bees buzzing about your Ears, be ye not troubled thereat, well knowing, and firmly be∣lieving, Heaven over-rules all.—Should you see Savages, disfigured and deformed, like Devils incarnate, come rushing in upon you, yelling and screaming, as if all Hell was let loose, be assured, if God sends his holy Angels to protect you, they that be for you, are more than they that are against you.—Should you see Scores fall on your right Hand, and on your left, know ye

that God is able to preserve you, if it be his holy Will; and should you die, if you are but in God's Favour, it will be an happy Exchange of Mortality, for Immorta∣lity; of Corruption, for Incorruption.—Men and Bre∣thren, be of good Courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for our People, for our Land, and for the Cities of our God; and let the Lord do that which is good in his Sight.—This is a critical Conjuncture, this is a portentous Interval, that must determine much of what unto us is valuable in this miserable World: Our Lives, our Liberties, our most holy Religion, are at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>take; and on you, under God, it depends, in a great Measure, whether we shall be a free People, or Slaves; whether we shall keep our most holy Religion, or whe∣ther we shall be necessitated to submit to Idolatry, Su∣perstition and Thraldom.—Remember the Heroes of old, how they fought the Battles of the Lord, for ye have them for an Ensample: Remember <HI>Abram, Moses, Caleb</HI> and <HI>Joshuah;</HI> remember <HI>Barak</HI> and <HI>Deborah, Gi∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eon</HI> and <HI>Jephthah,</HI> and <HI>Samson;</HI> forget not <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Jonathan,</HI> and others who were valiant, too long to tell, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or <HI>Judith,</HI> and the <HI>Maccabees.</HI>—Or is it, that ye think <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>se Examples far remote? Remember then, the Va∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our of the ancient <HI>Britons,</HI> and how King <HI>William</HI> of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>mmortal Memory fought!—Never forget how dear and precious, our venerable and pious Ancestors esteemed their Religion, and the Liberty of worshipping God in Spi∣rit and in Truth, that they emigrated out of their Native Country, on Purpose to enjoy the free Exercise of it here, when the whole of this Land was nothing else than a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ast Desart, and an howling Wilderness; and how va∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>antly they behaved ever since!

that its proud Walls gave way to your Arms, and it fell into your Hands; which was a Means of promoting the Peace of all <HI>Europe.</HI>—It seems the Lord by his Provi∣dence, hath placed you a Bulwark against the <HI>French</HI> Encroachments, there being yet something of the Life and Spirit of genuine Religion among you, which, alas! is too much lost in our Land!—Be ye then faithful in the Trust committed by Heaven to your Charge.—You have already suffered much by the <HI>French</HI> and their <HI>In∣dians,</HI> and what we are all like to suffer, if they (which God forbid!) should prevail over us, is too manifest to want any Explanation.—Our Land is yet in its In∣fancy, and Posterity is greatly interested in it, how w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at present behave.—Let therefore no one think too hard of it, to leave his Family and dear Relations, as well a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to venture his Life and Limbs, in order to engage i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this Enterprize; it is for their good, as well as for our own Persons.—If the Lord be with us, we may expect good Things yet to come.—Who knows, if War be de∣clared, but we take all <HI>Canada;</HI> and then we may expect Peace in our <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> which the Lord of his infinity Goodness grant, if it be his holy Will and Pleasure!— However, be this as it will, and leaving the hidde<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Things to the Lord our God, unto whom they appertai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> this is certain, that it is our indispensible Duty, now <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> behave ourselves valiantly, trusting the Event of the whole to him, whose Will must be done on Earth, as is in Heaven.—And that the gracious Presence of the Lord our God, may go with you on this Expedition that the Light of his Countenance shine upon you, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Terror of the Almighty seize your Enemies, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> smite them before your Faces, so that ye return triu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣phant, is my Blessing over you, out of the Sanctua<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Covenant God of his People, make it yea, and Am<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>

insoever you can.—Ye see already the vast Difference there is in Expeditions, when begun with the Lord, and when with Belial.—The Time was, that Forces came up to us on a shadowy Expedition, not having the Fear of God before their Eyes, nor his Greatness upon their Hearts, (sad Presages these of an unsuccessful Event, and of blasted Expectations!) Now you see Worshippers of the Deity, in Spirit and in Truth.—The Time was, that Forces came up to us, without Urim or Thummim, without Priest or Levite, to shew them the Way of the Lord.—Now ye see Priests of the Lord, with whom is Urim and Thummim, of which there is one come while I have been speaking, whom I bid welcome in the Name of the Lord.—The Time was, that you heard and saw nothing but cursing, swearing, drinking, carousing, dallying, playing, and all Manner of Impiety and Un∣godliness; now you hear and see Prayers put up to the Supreme Being, as constantly as the Morning and Even∣ing Sacrifice was offered up by the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> (Do ye the same in your Families?) Instead of the pro∣phane Music ye formerly heard on Balls and Assemblies, ye now hear the sacred Songs of <HI>Sion</HI> sung in their Camp. —Instead of Blasphemy and prophane Discourse, ye see and hear now a religious Conversation, (O that ye in this Respect followed their Example!)—The Time was, that Droves of Cattle were slaughtered, for the Sake of the Hides and Tallow, and Buildings demolished for the Sake of Fuel, or for the Nails and Iron Work in them, and when the aggrieved Party complained, the only sa∣tisfactory Answer they received for their Comfort, was, <Q>Such is the Tenor of War, so it always happens in Times of War.</Q>—Now you see that this is false; for not a Chicken hath been hurt, as yet, by these our <HI>New-England</HI> Brethren.—And as to Valour and Heroism, I who have been an impartial Spectator into the whole Scene, must say this of the few <HI>New-England</HI> Men we had then among us, to defend us against the Assaults of
<PB N="46" REF="007421_0024_102D841BAC442740"/>
the Enemy, that, as they had yet something of Religion, of which others seemed to have made a total Abjuration, they stood, where others fled; nay, where others dared not to set their Feet, they have kept the Field.—So than, if I prognosticate any Thing aright, the Omens are at present inclining to the fortunate Side, and we may, with the Blessing of God, hope for something great and good for our Land, to deliver us out of the Hands of our unjustly encroaching Enemies.—It may be, that on Account of our Sins, Heaven hath yet more Chastisements for us in store, and that these our Bre∣thren, who all the While will be but unequally yoked with Unbelievers, being overpowered by hostile Force and Numbers, are put to the Worst; but this I dare prophesy, they shall not fall unavenged of our Enemies, nor without making many of them bite the Ground, as an Attonement for the innocent Blood they have shed.— And therefore, what I have said once, I say again; let us be kind and loving to these our Friends and Brethren, as they are to us; and let us lend them an helping Hand when and wheresoever we can.—And the Lord speed and succeed them, with his Blessing from on High!— Say ye all in your Hearts, Amen, so be it.—</P>
<P>And may we all, they that go up hence, and they that continue here, yea the Whole of our Land, from <HI>Dan</HI> even unto <HI>Beersheba,</HI> (and O! that I could raise my Voice loud as Thunder, that all might hear! for we are a sinful Land, and a sinful People) altogether humble ourselves low before our God, penitently confessing our Sins and Abominations, fervently imploring his gracious Pardon and Forgiveness of our numerous Transgressions! May we thoroughly reform from our Vices! May we put away every wicked and unclean Thing from among us! May we become a holy People, zealous in good Works, acceptable to our God! O! that many may be stirred up, by the Lords holy Spirit, to inlist for spiri∣tual Warfare, under <HI>Emanuel</HI>'s Banner! O that many may
<PB N="47" REF="007421_0024_102D841BAC442740"/>
turn unto the Lord and live! O that many Souls may be conquered by the gracious Arrows of Heaven, and be overcome by the Shafts of God's Love, which surpasseth all Understanding!—Let us resign all our Concerns, and especially this Expedition, in his Hands, who governs the Universe, acquiescing in his eternal high Decree, whatsoever be the Event of Things.—Should we be put to the Worst, let us wait with Patience on the God of our Salvation, and persevere in fighting his Battles, until his Help appear out of <HI>Sion,</HI> his holy Hill, for our De∣liverance, and until his Time come to be gracious, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o shew Mercy to his Land, and to his People:—Are we victorious, let us be thankful to our God, proclaim∣ing his Praises with grateful Hearts, ascribing unto him all the Glory, (Not unto us, not unto us, but unto thy Name, O Lord, give Glory!) and walk in his holy Ways.</P>
<P>And now what shall I say more? I seem to have spoken all out, and nevertheless I fell as if I had yet much to speak.—O may Almighty God, who ruleth in the Hea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ens above, and on the Earth beneath, direct the Wars and Rumors of Wars he hath decreed over us, and all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>her Dispensations of his Providence that must come to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ss, for the good of our Land, and for <HI>Sion's</HI> Prospe∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y, that there be Peace and Truth in Length of Days! —And I conclude, praying as he taught us to pray, who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d the Spirit without Measure; eternal heavenly Fa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er, lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>vil: For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Glory, for ever.
