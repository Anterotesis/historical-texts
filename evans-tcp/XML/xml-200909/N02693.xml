<L><HI>Even what the hungry Wolf in Field would do</HI></L>

<P>And so, in getting us into Prison again, the Priest obtained his Point; but he missed of his Prey, and never got it.</P>
<P>Many were the loving, sweet and sensible Epistles, that she sent to me, when in Pri∣son; ever shewing her free Resignation to the Will of the Lord, in all her Exercises, which then were great; and with much Chearfulness and Patience she went thro' them. And since her Decease, I found these following Lines, which she had written, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<L>Are kept by One whom <HI>Winds</HI> and <HI>Waves</HI> obey:</L>
<L>Tho' sometimes exercis'd, thereby to learn</L>
<L>Who guards and sits a Pilot at the Stern,</L>
<L>And with his Arm of Power doth interpose</L>

<HI>will give you Rest; take my Yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in Heart, and ye shall find Rest to your Souls; for my Yoke is easy, and my Burden is light:</HI> And blessed be the Eternal Goodness, I have witnessed it to be so, in Comparison of the Bondage of Cor∣ruption. And I here insert my Exercise, for the Encouragement of the Sincere-hearted, that all may depend upon the Lord, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Heb. 11.6.</NOTE> who is a good <HI>Rewarder of those who diligently seek him;</HI> and can give Testimony, according to their Measure, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Prov. 3.17.</NOTE> that his <HI>Ways are Ways of Pleasantness, and all his Paths are Peace;</HI> there∣fore let those, whose Feet are thither turned, hold on their Way, and persevere in Righ∣teousness and Purity; that so they may grow stronger and stronger, and be able to lend a helping Hand to them who are weak; as this my dear Friend hath often done, both to me and others. And let all, who are yet seeking the Lord, and his Truth, be incou∣raged in Faithfulness and Obedience to fol∣low God's Requirings in their own Hearts; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Rom. 1.19.</NOTE> <HI>for that which may be known of God,</HI> is there manifest; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Eph. 5.13.</NOTE> <HI>and what∣soever doth make manifest, is Light,</HI> (viz.) the Light of Jesus, <HI>which enlighteneth eve∣ry Man that comes into the World:</HI> This is that which truly discovers God to Man, and Man to himself; yea, the whole <HI>Mystery of Godli∣ness.</HI>
<PB REF="003191_0005_0FF0168C1FAFCD18"/>Therefore let none tire in their Search after Truth, <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cal. 6.9.</NOTE> nor be <HI>weary in well∣doing, for they shall reap in due Sea∣son,</HI> the Benefit thereof, <HI>if they faint not, but hold out unto the End;</HI> as did the Author of the ensuing Verses: Of whom I am willing to give the Reader some Account.</P>
<P>She was one, who in her Childhood, was much afflicted with weak Eyes, which made her unfit for the usual Employment of Girls; and being of a large natural Capacity, quick, witty, and studiously inclined, her Father brought her up to more Learning, than is commonly bestowed upon our Sex; in which she became so good a Proficient, that she well understood the <HI>Latin Tongue,</HI> fluently discour∣sed in it; and made a considerable Progress in <HI>Greek</HI> also; wrote several Hands well; was a good <HI>Arithmetician,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Psal. 90.11.</NOTE> yea in the best Arithmetick; <HI>for she so num∣bered her Days, as to apply her Heart unto Wis∣dom;</HI> as also to the Study of several useful Arts; had a good Understanding of Physick and Chirurgery, the Nature of Plants, Herbs, and Minerals; and made some Inspection in∣to divers profitable Sciences, delighting in the Study of Nature, and to admire the great God of Nature, in the various Operations of his Power and Goodness, the wonderful Har∣mony and Order of the Creation, and the in∣finite Wisdom by which it is govern'd; of
<PB REF="003191_0005_0FF0168C1FAFCD18"/>which she would often speak: Admiring <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ow there could be an Atheist in the World; since the Creation doth so plainly assert the Being of a Deity. And as we have been walking or riding together, would o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten discourse of the present Objects, much tending to Edifi∣cation; making many pretty Remarks, and comparing outward Things with inward: As also upon all Occasions would draw such useful Observations, as made her Com∣pany profi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>able and delighting: For she was of a thoughtful composed Temper, yet of a quick Apprehension, and ingenious; which, being seasoned with Truth, (in which she had many sweet Openings) these meeting in a Temper conversable, and concerned for the Good of others, made her Conversation Im∣proving and desirable. She was one who loved the Blessed Truth (and they who walk∣ed according to it) from a Child, being ear∣ly convinced thereof; tho' she was not satis∣fiyed with a bare Profession of Religion, but zealous for the Life of it, both in her self and others; also furnished with good Argu∣ments to defend it, being ready to give an Answer to every one that asked <HI>a Reason of the Hope which was in her,</HI> with Meekness and Fear: Not forward to begin a Dispute, yet sound in what the undertook, and never (that I know of) foil'd in an Argument; for she had an Eye to the Lord, and liked to be sa∣tisfied
<PB REF="003191_0006_0FF0168F65A50DF0"/>that she was in her Place, and called by him to what she did for him: Would often mention the Passage of <HI>Ʋzza,</HI> 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> 6.6, 7. how Death was his Punishment, for putting forth his Hand to take hold of the Ark of God, when the Oxen shook it, being a Service not required of him.</P>
<P>Nor was she proud, or conceited of her Parts and Learning, but adorned with an humble Modesty; having, I believe, meaner Thoughts of her self, than any one else had of her, who knew her Qualifications.</P>
<P>Plain and decent in her Cloaths, which she valued for Service more than Sight; and slighted in Comparison of those better Or∣naments of the Mind, which she preferr'd above splendid or costly Apparel.</P>
<P>She was one who loved to read the Holy Scriptures, and such useful Authors, as had a Tendency to Improvement; in which she spent much Time: God having furnished her with an extraordinary Memory, to retain the same.</P>
<P>She delighted much in Solitude, and was often alone; setting apart some Time of the Day for Retirement; and would frequently say to me, in the Evenings, <HI>Let us go aside, and wait upon the Lord; we have daily need of daily Bread, and to renew our Strength; and how can we expect it, if we do not wait for it?</HI> and would recite the Passage of <HI>Elijah,</HI> 1 Kings
<PB REF="003191_0006_0FF0168F65A50DF0"/>18.36. that at the Time of the <HI>Evening Sa∣crifice,</HI> the Lord answered by Fire; with o∣ther pretty Remarks, too tedious to insert, which she abounded in, upon all Occasions, to promote that which was good. In these Times of Retirement, Verses would come up in her Mind, which she after wrote: Ma∣ny of these, herewith printed, being Medi∣tations according to the Frame and Exercise of her Spirit, when thus composed.</P>
<P>Neither did she neglect publick Opportu∣nities to worship God; for she was diligent in frequenting religious Meetings, not being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pt to omit any, unless upon extraordinary Occasion. Nor did she suffer her Eyes to vander, which the Mind too often accom∣panies, but the Composedness of her Coun∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enance shewed the Sedateness of her well-exercised Mind: And the good Improve∣ment she made of publick and private De∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>otion, her innocent and Christian Life did <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>early discover; which she well began her <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>rly Years, and manifested her Progress <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>erein, by her Constancy and Perseverance the End, which crowns all; for <HI>'tis he at endures to the End that shall be saved:</HI> This <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e had a Regard to, more than the fading enjoyments of this uncertain World; and I believe, she was in a good Condition when she <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t it, and laid down her Head in Peace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>th the Lord, leaving a good Savour behind</P>
<P><PB REF="003191_0007_0FF0169109570978"/>
She was one who willingly and chearfully sufferted for the Truth, encomaging others to do the like, both by Precept and Example: One just, honest, and true to her Word, tem∣perate and selt-denying; keeping within the Limits prescribed for Health, which she re∣garded, more than to gratify a luxurious Ap∣petite; solid and grave in her Carriage, mixt with an innocent Chearfulness; not formal∣ly austere; yet rather reserved, than over∣free; bashful, than bold.</P>
<P>To conclude, she was one whose Modesty, Charity, Friendship, and religious Conver∣sation, came not short of her excellent Wri∣tings; to which I refer the Reader, for a fuller Character of their Author, than I am capable of giving; her own Pen having dis∣cover'd the rich Treasure of her pious Mind. But what I have written, is from an expe∣rimental Knowledge of her; and no one, I believe, knew her better than my self: For she was as much without Reserve to me, I think, as one Friend could be to another for we loved entirely, communicated ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Minds and Exercises to each other freely advising with one another on most Occasi∣ons: And great was our Nearness and Uni∣ty of the Spirit, in the Truth; yea, great her Concern for my Welfare, which she zea lously labour'd for; as the many Letters, both in Verse and Prose, to me writ, and here with printed, largely demonstrates.</P>
<P><PB REF="003191_0007_0FF0169109570978"/>
And tho' Verse is not so commonly used in Divine Subjects, as Prose, and but too much abused by the extravagant Wits of the Age; yet the, like a skilful Chymist, had learned to separate the purer Spirits, and more refined Parts of Poetry, from the earthly, worthless Dross; and made use of her Gi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>t, rather to convince and prevail upon the Mind, to af∣fect and raise the Soul upon Wings of Divine Contemplation, than to please the any Fancy with Strains of Wit, and unprofitable Inven∣tion, which she was ever careful to avoid.</P>
<P>And tho' living Testimonies to the Truth are numerous, yet few extant in Verse, which hath an harmonious delighting Faculty in it, that influences the Minds of some more than Prose, especially young People, and is more apt to imprint it felt in the Memory: Therefore, her Subject being divine, and so sensibly and solidly managed; as it hath been of Service to those few who have had the Perusal of it, so, I hope, will be attended with a General Benefit.</P>
<P>And having reaped no small Advantage thereby my self, could do no less, than re∣commend her worthy Labours, and examplary Life to others, as a Pattern well worth fol∣lowing. For her Acquaintance may say of her, as was said of <HI>Ruth, The City of my Peo∣ple doth know that she was a vertuous Woman.</HI> And being a good Instrument in the Hand of
<PB REF="003191_0008_0FF01692AC669F78"/>the Lord to me, having also been much comforted, encouraged and refreshed by her Verses, my Desire is, That the Lord may so bless them to Posterity, that many may reap such an Advantage by them, as may tend to the Promotion of Truth, and the Good of Souls in general.</P>
<P><HI>Which is the sincere Desire of an universal Well-wisher to all Mankind.</HI></P>

<HEAD>A Testimony concerning my dear Friend, <HI>Mary Molineux.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS concerning my dearly beloved Friend, <HI>Mary Molineux,</HI> I have more to testify, than I shall commit to Writing, having had intimate Acquaintance and Fellowship with her above Sixteen Years; in all which Time, her grave, vertuous modest Life and Conver∣sation, deserveth singular Remembrance; be∣cause and Deportment, was always solid sensible, and tender, mixt with a feeling and sympathizing Love to her Friends, in all Exercises and Afflictions: She was one to whom I could freely impart my Mind and Concerns, in any Exercises; as I often have done, to my Comfort and Refreshment. My
<PB REF="003191_0008_0FF01692AC669F78"/>Heart is moved, in the Remembrance of her Faithfulness and Integrity, from the Day that I was first acquainted with her, with Sorrow for the Loss of so near a Friend; who, al∣tho' she was plentifully endued with many worthy Gifts and Parts, both natural and Spiritual, yet I never knew her <HI>lifted up</HI> in any of them, nor <HI>exalted above her Measure;</HI> but rather reserved than in any wise forwardly divulging her Gifts to the publick Censure, without weighty Consideration; so that she would not cast her Pearls before Swine: Yet not so much reserved, but that to her near intimate Friends, whom she knew in the Fellowship and Bond of Truth, she was very free and tender. I remember, that several Years ago, when she was a single Woman, upon the Perusal of some Copies of her Ver∣ses, which she gave me, I felt such Unity of Spirit with them, that I said, I thought they might be of Service, if made publick in Print; but she was not then free, that her Name should be exposed; she not seeking Praise amongst Men, but to communicate the Exercise of peculiar Gifts amongst her near Friends and Acquaintance: But now, since it hath pleased the Lord to remove her out of the Earthly Tabernacle, into Everlasting Rest, in which, I am well satisfied, she is for ever blessed, I think it would be ungrate∣ful to her Memory, and also a wronging of
<PB REF="003191_0009_0FF01695844C5F50"/>others, to keep such worthy Things unpub∣lished; with which I believe, the most that are of open Understandings, and unprejudi∣ced Hearts, will have (in some measure) U∣nity. I desire and hope, they may truly tend to the Benefit of all moderate Readers, and to the Praise of him, who is the only Author of every good and perfect Gift.</P>

<HEAD>A <HI>Testimony</HI> concerning my late Wife, <HI>Mary Mollineux</HI> deceased.</HEAD>
<P>COncerning my dear, loving, and late de∣ceased Wife, <HI>Mary Mollineux,</HI> formerly <HI>Mary Southworth,</HI> whom I took in Marriage on the 10th Day of the 2d Month, 1685. I was first acquainted with her at <HI>Lancaster-Castle,</HI> where we both, at one Time, were Prisoners for being at peaceable religious Meetings of the People called <HI>Quakers,</HI> in the Year 1684, (tho' we had seen each other before.) In which Imprisonment, I believed that she should be my Wife; but never intended to express any thing thereof, whilst we were both Prisoners, there; and after she was released, I saw her and was in Company with her several Times, before I expressed any thing of my Concern to take her to be my Wife; several conside∣rable Men having before attempted to prevail with her on that Account: And during the whole Time of my Acquaintance with her, which was above Eleven Years; her Life and
<PB REF="003191_0010_0FF01697A23A19A8"/>Conversation was serious, innocent, sweet and savoury; and she was very loving, diligent, ten∣der-hearted, and kindly affectionate towards me and our Children; and generally loving and tender towards all People, especially such as were in any Distress, Sickness, or Affliction, tho' never so poor; and the Lord blessed her En∣deavours, as well in Advice, as Administra∣tion of Remedies, to several; so that they have acknowledged their Recoveries to have been thereby, thro' his Blessing: And what she did therein, was free. She was very care∣ful, that nothing of Evil might get a Place in her Children, or in any with whom she was concerned: And therefore good Advice and Admonition she frequently gave, which many received in Love and good Esteem of her. The Lord opened her Understanding, and enlarged her Capacity, in a great Degree, upon several Accounts; yet her Mind was not lifted up thereby, so as to glory in her Gifts or Parts; but, learning of Christ the Truth, to be <HI>lowly in Heart,</HI> she chose rather to appear little to Men. She was very con∣stant and cordial to her Friends, and true in concealing of Secrets. She was often con∣cerned to make Peace amongst them that were at Difference, and often prevailed therein. She was plain and free in speaking to the Faces of any, but abhorred to reproach any in secret. Her Heart was inclined towards
<PB REF="003191_0010_0FF01697A23A19A8"/>God, therefore she was just in her Dealing with all People, with whom she had to do. She was convinced of the Way of Truth in her Youth, by the Light or inward Appea∣rance of Christ in her Heart, which she lo∣ved; and therefore (she retaining her In∣tegrity to the End of her Time) a Crown of endless Life and Glory, I believe, the Lord hath bestowed upon her. She was very no∣ble in suffering Persecution for the Testimo∣ny of Truth, and in enduring hard Exerci∣ses, occasioned by my several Imprisonments for the same Cause, whilst she was my Wife. And thro' several Sicknesses and Afflictions the Lord supported her, to persevere in Pa∣tience, Faithfulness, and Constancy to him. She was very punctual in Performance of her Undertakings, and quick, discreet and diligent in her Business; yet still she used to take a Time for private Retirement in Evenings alone, (except I was with her) to wait upon, and feel after the Lord, in the Gift of his Light, Love and Grace in her Heart; and to see that, with the wise Vir∣gins, she had Oyl in her Burning Lamp, that it might not go out; but that she might be ready to enter into the Marriage-Chamber, whensoever the Lord, the Bride∣groom of her Soul, came. She was also very diligent, in attending the Assemblies of the People of God, called <HI>Quakers,</HI> with
<PB REF="003191_0011_0FF0169A045B0168"/>them, to meet in the Name, Power, Light and Spirit of the Lord, to wait upon him, to be opened by him, and to receive Re∣freshment, Strength and Comfort from him, and to feel the Renewings of his Love and Goodness in her Soul. And that Day-week next before her last Illness seized her (after a more than usual Manner) she said to me, <HI>That the feeling and enjoying of the sweet eternal Love of God in her Heart, was more precious to her, than all other things that could be enjoyed, &amp;c.</HI> She was concerned in her Spirit, that many, with her, and all that are faithful to God, might <HI>come</HI> to <HI>taste and see how good the Lord is;</HI> and upon that Account, her Words, Writings, and Conversation, were acceptable, prevalent and serviceable, to the Invitation, Convincement, Strengthning and Encourage∣ment of some to seek after the Lord, and his bleised Way and Truth, inwardly re∣vealed, and to be revealed; wherein many have found great Satisfaction, and Cause of rejoycing. And that many more may receive Benefit by her Writings, I am desirous and concerned to publish them, and refer all so∣ber Readers, in the Fear of God, to peruse them; not doubting but such may receive Advantage thereby; tho' she was not free to commit them to publick View in her Life-Time, yet she had nothing against the publishing thereof afterwards.</P>
<P><PB REF="003191_0011_0FF0169A045B0168"/>
And now I shall give a brief Account of what I was, and am a Witness of, concern∣ing her last Illness; and some of the sweet, sensible and precious Words which she spake in the Time thereof, being very sensible to the End; so that she spake no impertinent or unsensible Word therein, that I know of, who constantly attended her.</P>
<P>Upon the Eighth Day of the 10th Month, 1695. she was seized with violent Pain and Sickness, which continued, sometimes more, and sometimes less: And one Morning, soon after, she said to me thus; <HI>I have had such a Dream, as I have seldom had; it is an Emblem of my Life;</HI> and then she told it me thus; viz. <HI>She dreamed, that she was going at the Side of a pleasant broad River, and sometimes she came to Breaches; which, Brooks running into the River, or the like, had made upon the Shore of it; which Breaches she passed over, but sometimes with Difficulty, and then ran fast on still, till she came to another Breach; and having passed seve∣ral Breaches, some greater, and some lesser, at last she came to a Breach which was greater than any of the rest, and she said within her self, How shall I get over this Breach? But she went on, and passed thro' it, and it was fair on the other Side; and she awaked.</HI> Now, as she looked upon this Dream to be an Emblem of her Life, so I cannot (nor could not since she told it me) expound it otherwise than thus; <HI>viz.</HI> That
<PB REF="003191_0012_0FF0169D3518D1B8"/>the pleasant broad River signified the Lord her Creator, (who is to his People <HI>a Place of broad Rivers,</HI> Isa. 31.21.) and the Shore thereof, upon which she walked, signified Time, and the Breaches, which she passed over, were the Difficulties and Afflictions which she passed thro' in her Time; and the last and greatest Breach, which she came to, and passed over, signified her last Sickness and Death. From which Dream (as a significant Parable) all may learn and consider how fast they are hastning or run∣ning towards their last and greatest Breach; even the Death or Dissolution of their earth∣ly Tabernacles; and none knoweth how near they are to it. About Nine Days after her said Illness began, she said to me thus, viz. <HI>I am well content, if the Lord see meet, that he take me away by this Distemper, rather to be in this Pain; for my Pain is great, and I know not what is in this World I can desire, to stay to enjoy, except it is my Love, and my little Lads;</HI> meaning me, and our two Children. Of whom she then said thus, <HI>I would rather have my Children en∣riched with the Fear of the Lord, than with all Manner of Worldly Riches.</HI> About the same Time, she said, <HI>I am thinking of honest</HI> Rich∣ard Johnson, (who was a near Friend to us) <HI>that slept much of the Time of his Illness, before his Departure; methinks it seemeth like an easie Passage.</HI> And soon after that, she began to
<PB REF="003191_0012_0FF0169D3518D1B8"/>be inclind to Sleepiness, and slept more and more, till the End; yet, at her awaking, was still sensible and chearful: And tho' she was daily weaker and weaker, yet she would still sit up five or six, or more Hours in the E∣venings, and discourse freely and chearfully, till within five Days of her Departure. I often desired her to to accept of the Advice of some Physitian, but she was still averse thereto, in this Illness, tho' in others she had complied. On the 20th Day of her Ill∣ness, in the Evening, discoursing very freely (as formerly) she told me, <HI>She was well sa∣tisfied, that if the Lord took her away by that Distemper, she should be eternally Happy;</HI> with many other sensible and comfortable Expres∣sions: Tho' she was so weak, that the same Evening, about the eleventh Hour, I thought she had been departing; but in a little Time, recovering her Breath, she spoke chearfully and slept. At her awaking, that Night, I asked her, How she was? She answered, <HI>Thro' Mercy, indifferent.</HI> And after a little Pause, she very sensibly said, <HI>Amictum iri, vet Amiciendum esse;</HI> which is in <HI>English, To be cloathed hereafter,</HI> in two Expressions of it: Whereby I understood, that she was mind∣ing, how the Lord would cloath her here∣after, when her Mortal Cloathing was put off. Then I desired her in English Words, (for they that were present, understood not
<PB REF="003191_0013_0FF0169ED29BF638"/><HI>Latin,</HI>) that if she had any thing in her Mind, either concerning her Children, or any other Thing farther to communicate to me, that she would do it; but she, (as if all outward Things were then out of her Thoughts) quickly replied in <HI>Latin, Why speakest thou such Things? Dost not thou understand me?</HI> I answer∣ed in <HI>Latin, Yes, I very well understand thee, and that thou speakest of Spiritual Things:</HI> She answered, <HI>Yes, but she had nothing concerning outward Things, farther to communicate to me.</HI> The next Morning, about the Ninth Hour, I again thought she had been departing; but after a little Time, somewhat recover∣ing her Breath, and seeing me express, to Friends that were present, something or my Concern for her, she said to me, <HI>Ne nimis solicitus esto;</HI> that is, in <HI>English, Be not thou overmuch careful,</HI> or <HI>troubled;</HI> which Advice took Impression in my Heart: And that was the last <HI>Latin</HI> Sentence that she spake, that I know of; and she never spake in <HI>Latin,</HI> in this Illness, that I remember, except when Company was present, that she would speak only to me? A little after, most of the Company being gone out, I asked her, how she was? She answered, <HI>Drawing nearer and nearer.</HI> And many sweet and loving Senten∣ces she spake to me that Day, and the Day next after; but afterwards was scarcely able to answer to any Question, but continued
<PB REF="003191_0013_0FF0169ED29BF638"/>mostly sleeping, as it were, sweetly and qui∣etly: And on the Third Day of the 11th Month, 1695, in the Evening, she departed, without any Noise, Sigh, or Groan.</P>
<P>And so, tho' the Lord, who in his Love, joyned us together, and gave us for Blessings to each other, and blessed us with the abun∣dant Increase of his Love in our Hearts, even to the end of her Time, hath seen meet to take from me her Company, which I valu∣ed above all other Temporal Enjoyments; the Loss whereof is great to me: Yet being sa∣tisfied, that she is entred into Rest, in the Bosom of God's Love, with him, to live in Peace and Happiness for ever; and also, be∣ing clear, in that, thro' his Assistance, ac∣cording to the Understanding given me, I have endeavoured fully to discharge my Duty of endeared Love to her in every respect, in her last (as well as former) Exercises; there∣fore I am, in the Love of God, comforted, and can chearfully and freely say, The Lord's Will is worthy to be done in all things, and his Name to be blessed, praised and magni∣ted, over all, for ever,</P>

<HEAD>A few Words more, in Remembrance of my Dear Wife, <HI>M. M.</HI></HEAD>
<L>THO' it may seem to some that read my Lines</L>
<L>As a delightful thing, because their Minds</L>
<L>Still their Enjoyments have; yet they must know</L>
<L>No lasting Joys remain in things below.</L>
<L>The Scythe of Time, Death, parteth Friend from Friend,</L>
<L>But to true Friendship cannot put an End;</L>
<L>Tho' Friends surviving, Exercise may find,</L>
<L>Whose Friend's remov'd, whilst they remain behind.</L>
<L>My Friend, my Friend, my dearest Friend, my <HI>Wife</HI></L>
<L>The greatest Joy and Comfort of my Life,</L>
<L>In Visibles, is now remov'd from me:</L>
<L>Tho', as one destitute of Hope, I see</L>
<L>No Cause to mourn for her; but sure I may</L>
<L>Be, for my Loss, concern'd: Yet this can say,</L>
<L>The Lord hath giv'n, the Lord hath took again,</L>
<L>High Praises still be to his glorious Name,</L>
<L>Tho' mine's the Loss, hers is the endless Gain.</L>
<L>Altho' to me my Loss to bear is hard,</L>
<L>Yet am I from repining quite debarr'd;</L>
<L>The Lord doth with his Goodness so supply,</L>
<L>My Soul shall ever praise him, till I die.</L>
<L>Bless'd be the Day, wherein my Love abounded,</L>
<L>At first to her, and Friendship firm was found,</L>
<L>In our united Hearts; my faithful Friend!</L>
<L>Friendship 'twixt thee and me shall never end.</L>
<L>She was my <HI>Wife</HI> for full <HI>Ten Years;</HI></L>
<L>Short <HI>Time!</HI>) which we in tender Love did pass alas,</L>

Endearingly, which in our Hearts was sown</L>
<L>Some time before, by the Eternal One;</L>
<L>Which, living in our Bosoms, did encrease,</L>
<L>Until the <HI>Time</HI> of her deplor'd Decease,</L>
<L>And now's as fresh as ever. Surely she</L>
<L>Who wrote of Friendship, Love's extream Degree,</L>
<L>(Altho' with Life, her Pen was much sublim'd,</L>
<L>Yet) did not, as her Bosom held it, find</L>
<L><HI>Words,</HI> half sufficient, fully to declare</L>
<L>The faithful Love she to her Friend did bear.</L>
<L>True, tender-hearted, in Affection kind,</L>
<L>Exceeding diligent, and much inclin'd</L>
<L>All for to serve in Love; but much more me,</L>
<L>To whom she had comply'd my <HI>Wife</HI> to be.</L>
<L>She to the Age of thirty-four Years stay'd</L>
<L>A modest, chaste, reserv'd, ingenious Maid;</L>
<L>Who did not only write of Modesty,</L>
<L>(In <HI>Words</HI> profound) and spotless Chastity,</L>
<L>But in Example was, as well as <HI>Words,</HI></L>
<L>A Pattern in the same; wherein accords</L>
<L>Her Life, Works, Writings, Words, true, lovely, sweet,</L>
<L>Which in concinnate Harmony did meet.</L>
<L>And as she wrote of <HI>Worship, Truth</HI> and <HI>Zeal,</HI></L>
<L>With Courage bold for God, she did not fail;</L>
<L>Being by his Arm upheld, when deeply prov'd,</L>
<L>To stand a faithful <HI>Witness:</HI> For she lov'd</L>
<L>The Praise of God, more than the Praise of Men;</L>
<L>Therefore was more to him, seem'd less to them</L>
<L>That did not choose his Fear; wherein she found</L>

Tho' of the chief in <HI>Babel's</HI> Learning, they</L>
<L>Stood as amaz'd, and knew not what to say.</L>
<L>A Bishop of two Counties Diocess</L>
<L>Her Question'd, she Reply'd, He proved this:</L>
<L>His Chaplain then (the Master's Cause to mend)</L>
<L>Attempting to dispute, was foyl'd i'th the End;</L>
<L>Whose Brother (being a Lawyer) present cry'd,</L>
<L>Her Learning made her mad, when she reply'd,</L>
<L>He, as asham'd, and speechless, turn'd aside.</L>
<L>Thus three great learned Men, of subtil Wit,</L>
<L>(To Silence put) did in One Hour submit</L>
<L>T' a <HI>little Woman</HI> crown'd with <HI>Wisdom's</HI> Bays,</L>
<L>Who, in God's Fear, did celebrate his Praise;</L>
<L>Declaring boldly gainst that <HI>Worship,</HI> which</L>
<L>God ne'er set up, that makes its Merchants rich.</L>
<L>She lov'd the precious <HI>Truth</HI> (plac'd in her Heart)</L>
<L>For which she was imprison'd; but the Smart</L>
<L>Its Adversaries felt: For Joy to her</L>
<L>Thereby accru'd, who did its Cause prefer</L>
<L>Before all <HI>Transitories.</HI> And, when I</L>
<L>Was Prisoner for the same, it was <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>y Joy</L>
<L>That she great Exercise did nobly bear,</L>
<L>Therein rejoycing in God's Holy Fear:</L>
<L>Tho' for her sake Grief pierced oft my Mind,</L>
<L>Where I the Sense did of her Suffering find</L>
<L>So deep, that from mine Eyes my Sleep withdrew,</L>
<L>And secret <HI>Tears</HI> did frequently pursue:</L>
<L>Yea, without outward Notice, once was I,</L>
<L>When she was, by Distemper, like to die,</L>
<L>Made sensible thereof, tho' in the Goal,</L>
<L>Distant near forty Miles, and did condole;</L>
<L><PB REF="003191_0015_0FF016A2F567E3E8"/>
And for her to the Lord I pray'd, whose Ear</L>
<L>Was open, and thro' Prison-walls did hear;</L>
<L>And he releas'd her from her Malady,</L>
<L>And me from Prison, her again to see;</L>
<L>Tho' then confin'd, as firm as Men could tye;</L>
<L>Praises be to God's Name Eternally.</L>
<L>She sweetly wrote of Charity Divine,</L>
<L>Which in her Heart and Life did clearly shine</L>
<L>More bright, than in her <HI>Words,</HI> which did extend,</L>
<L>In her, to poor and rich, to Foe and Friend:</L>
<L>To all in Plainness she, with due respect,</L>
<L>Would freely shew her Sense; but to reflect</L>
<L>Gainst any being absent, did eschew;</L>
<L>Charity taught her better things to do.</L>
<L>To any, in Affliction, she was free</L>
<L>Advice to give, or help with Remedy,</L>
<L>Where her Endeavours could; which God did bless,</L>
<L>Remarkably, with the desir'd Success:</L>
<L>Yea, sometimes, when Physicians had been try'd,</L>
<L>Much Money paid, and still the Cure deny'd</L>
<L>To their Performance, she in Freeness gave</L>
<L>What from Distempers dreadful, prov'd to save.</L>
<L>But Charity in her did farther move</L>
<L>Her tender Heart, in Sympathizing Love,</L>
<L>To use her <HI>Tongue</HI> or <HI>Pen,</HI> a <HI>Word</HI> to give</L>
<L>To Minds in Exercise; which did relieve,</L>
<L>Convince, or satisfie, and strengthen some,</L>
<L>The Race of Vertue in their time to run:</L>
<L>For which, some have good Cause to bless the Name</L>
<L>Of God, from whom those <HI>Words</HI> with Vertue came.</L>
<L><PB REF="003191_0016_0FF016A490638A98"/>
<HI>This</HI> is not writ to magnify her Praise,</L>
<L>The <HI>Praise belongs to God,</HI> who first did raise</L>
<L>Her Mind from things below, to seek his <HI>Truth,</HI></L>
<L>Hid in her Heart, in time of tender Youth;</L>
<L>Which, truly sought, she found, and prized more</L>
<L>Than <HI>Ophir's</HI> Gold, or Pearls of <HI>Indian</HI> Shore.</L>
<L>This taught her to discern the way of God,</L>
<L>From ways of Men; this made her love his Rod;</L>
<L>This gave her Knowledge of her Duty right</L>
<L>Unto the <HI>Lord;</HI> this gave her also Sight</L>
<L>Into the Properties of needful things,</L>
<L>Of many kinds, that Mortals Comfort brings:</L>
<L>This gave her, in her tender Years to see</L>
<L>The frail Estate of poor Mortality;</L>
<L>The Sense whereof she daily did retain,</L>
<L>Striving, with earnest Diligence, to gain</L>
<L>The precious Pearl of Immortality,</L>
<L>As if she knew how short her <HI>Time</HI> should be;</L>
<L>In Hope of which, when painful Death assail'd</L>
<L>Her Mortal Part, her Courage never fail'd;</L>
<L>But did (with Sense as ever) shew</L>
<L>Her true Content, and Satisfaction too,</L>
<L>To leave this <HI>World;</HI> of true Felicity,</L>
<L>To be possess'd to all Eternity.</L>
<L>O may with me, her Offspring still remain</L>
<L>In God's pure Fear, Eternal Life to gain,</L>
<L>Then, this short <HI>Time</HI> once past, we may in Peace</L>
<L>Live with the Just, where Joys shall never cease,</L>
<L>Where we, with her, may living Praises sing</L>

<L>Themselves Discreetly, Modest, Meek, and Grave;</L>
<L>But if a Smile appear, such as a Child</L>

<L>'Tis guarded with such simple Innocence,</L>
<L>As gives no just occasion of Offence.</L>

<L>Than wanton Looks; but daunts approaching harm</L>
<L>Like some strong Fortress, whence the Enemy</L>
<L>Retreats, despairing of a Victory</L>
<L>Thus Modesty, and Spotless Innocence,</L>
<L>Is often to its serra sure Defence.</L>
<L>This is the Virgin's Omament, whereby</L>

<L>A bold Affront to Spotless Modesty.</L>

<L>WHEN <HI>Babel</HI>'s <HI>Grandees,</HI> by unjust Decree,</L>
<L>With Royal Signet, surreptitiously</L>
<L>Obtain'd, had feal'd an Edict, That none should</L>

<L>To make Petition, save unto their King,</L>
<L>In Thirty Days; in hopes thereby to bring</L>

<L>Did he not, with his Window open, pray</L>

<L>For <HI>Israel</HI>'s Seed, in their afflicted State?</L>

<L>Now some may say, <HI>What,</HI> Daniel, <HI>couldst not thou</HI></L>

</LG>
<LG>
<PB N="136" REF="003191_0067_0FF017111D195358"/>
<L>So things that once seem'd difficult, became</L>

<L>WHen <HI>conqu'ring Babel's Foes</HI> were subjugate,</L>

<L>King <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> triumph'd in Pride,</L>
<L>And his Concerns of War seem'd laid aside;</L>
<L>Who glorying in his Strength, not in the Lord,</L>

The Sentence is, <HI>The Fiery Furnace must</HI></L>
<L><HI>Consume the Rebel's Body unto Dust.</HI></L>
<L>Yet there were captive <HI>Jews</HI> of Royal Blood,</L>
<L>Who, in their Zeal for <HI>Israel</HI>'s God, withstood</L>
<L>That cursed Edict, that vain Law reject,</L>
<L>That strict Decrce with them had small Effect:</L>
<L>Then the Informers, that observ'd the <HI>Jews,</HI></L>
<L>And fought for an Occasion to accuse</L>
<L>The Innocent, (as some do now) drew near;</L>
<L>And first, to gain acceptance in his Ear,</L>
<L>Said, <HI>Live, O King, for ever! Thou hast made</HI></L>
<L><HI>A firm Decree, which some have not obey'd;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Even Three conceited Jews, who neither thee</HI></L>
<L><HI>Regard, nor to thy Gods do how their Knee.</HI></L>
<L>O how his Fury doth at this arise!</L>
<L>That any should his Golden God despise:</L>
<L>His Visage doth its native Features change;</L>
<L>His Eyes, with <HI>sparkling Rage, proclaim Revenge:</HI></L>
<L>Therefore, at his Command, they all in Haste</L>
<L>The Persons of the innocent arrest;</L>
<L>Call'd <HI>Shadrach, Meshech,</HI> and <HI>Abednego,</HI></L>
<L>And they before the wrathful King must go</L>
<L>To prove the Matter; and, it seems to try</L>
<L>It they would bow: Which, when they still de∣ny,</L>
<L>As knowing, He alone that did create</L>
<L>The Fire, and all things else, could soon abate</L>
<L>Its Violence; and from the threatning Hand</L>
<L>Of <HI>Babel</HI>'s King, deliver them that stand</L>
<L>In Awe to none but him, and fear not Man;</L>
<L>But dread the living God, who only can</L>

Kill and destroy, or save and keep alive;</L>
<L>For He to Man doth Life and Being give.</L>
<L>This they believing, did not study how</L>
<L>To answer; but resolved not to bow</L>
<L>To any, but the Lord: Altho' the King</L>
<L>Seem'd in his Wrath, to count it as a thing</L>
<L>Impossible, that any God could be</L>
<L>So potent, to withstand his fierce Decree.</L>
<L>But Great <HI>JEHOVAH</HI> did that Law confound;</L>
<L>For when all <HI>Three</HI> were in their <HI>Vestments</HI> bound,</L>
<L>And cast into the furious fiery Flame,</L>
<L>Th' Eternal Word did pow'rfully restrain</L>
<L>Its proper Quality, and so surround</L>
<L>Them with <HI>Defence,</HI> no <HI>Harm</HI> on <HI>them</HI> was found:</L>
<L>Yet did the Fire retain its former Vigor,</L>
<L>And manifest it with resistless Rigor,</L>
<L>Against those Men, who bold to execute</L>
<L>The King's Command, the Just did persecute:</L>
<L>Which, when <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> saw, dismay'd,</L>
<L>He rose in haste, and to his Nobles said,</L>
<L><HI>Were not three Men cast bound into the Flame?</HI></L>
<L>They answer'd, <HI>True:</HI> The King reply'd again,</L>
<L><HI>Now, in the midst thereof, behold, I see</HI></L>
<L><HI>Four Men walk loose, and from their Fetters free;</HI></L>
<L><HI>Whereof the Fourth seems cloath'd in Majesty,</HI></L>
<L><HI>As Son of the Immortal Deity.</HI></L>
<L>Thus was the Lofty forced to confess,</L>
<L>There was a Pow'r above him, and to bless</L>
<L>The God of <HI>Israel;</HI> set his Servants free,</L>
<L>That, trusting in him, would not bow the Knee</L>

Unto, or serve another, than the Lord,</L>
<L>Their only God; but, as with one accord,</L>
<L>Did yield their Bodies to his Will, that they</L>
<L>Might magnify him in their Trial-Day.</L>
<L>Consider now, had they not faithful been,</L>
<L>The Captive Seed of <HI>Israel</HI> had not seen</L>
<L>That great Deliverance, so signally</L>
<L>Wrought for them, that, in true Simplicity,</L>
<L>Resign'd themselves, their all, unto the Lord,</L>

<L>His holy Name, who reigns in Righteousness;</L>
<L>Deposing Kingdoms unto whom he sees</L>
<L>Most fic, and changing Man's perverse Decrees.</L>
<L>Lord, may thy Wisdom, in these latter Days,</L>
<L>Limit, or turn Man's Wrath unto thy Praise!</L>
<L>Put thou an Hook into the Jaws of those,</L>
<L>That study politickly to oppose</L>
<L>Thy Works of Love and Wonder, in the Land,</L>
<L>And with their Subtilty seek to withstand</L>
