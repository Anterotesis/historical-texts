<P>My Son give Me thy Heart.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THIS gracious <HI>Exhortation</HI> speaketh unto us as unto <HI>Children.</HI> It is the great GOD that so bespeaks as by the mouth and pen of in∣spired <HI>Solomon,</HI> the wisest and g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>t Man in the World in his time.</P>
<P><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> greater than <HI>Solomon</HI> is here even <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> GOD who inspired him, the <HI>Rock <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></HI> who spake by him. Him we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> come forth to hear, and his Word <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>od come with Power upon our hearts,
<PB N="2" REF="003010_0003_0FEF9D4DE7C88A30"/>as it doth with divine Authority to our Consciences. Let it command our highest Reverence and best Attention.</P>
<P>GOD is the <HI>Father</HI> of all men, and as a Father he here speaks to <HI>all</HI> of us, the greater &amp; the less, the Elder and the Younger. He demands the Heart of every one, and all hearts are his: He values all hearts alike, the poor as well as the rich; the Soul of the Father and that of the Son.</P>
<P>BUT my <HI>Text</HI> is more especially directed unto <HI>Young People;</HI> it speaks to Children and Youth. The whole Book of <HI>Proverbs</HI> is inscribed to such, 1 Chap. 5. v. <HI>To give the young man Knowlege and Discretion.</HI> And in the <HI>Verses</HI> just before my <HI>Text</HI> young Peo∣ple are in a particular manner addres∣sed unto v. 15. <HI>My son if thy heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice even mine; yea my reins shall rejoice when thy lip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> speak right things.</HI> And v. 22. <HI>He<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to thy Father that begat the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, and d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/> not thy Mother when she is old <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> v 24, 25. <HI>The Father of the Right<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> shall greatly rejoice, and be that be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>
<PB N="3" REF="003010_0003_0FEF9D4DE7C88A30"/>a wise Child shall have joy of him; thy Father and thy Mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice.</HI> — The next words are those of my Text, <HI>My son give me thy heart.</HI></P>
<P>THEY are therefore directed to <HI>young Persons,</HI> as such; and so I shall chiefly consider them. And le<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our young People take them as they are meant, &amp; observe diligently in them.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>WHAT manner of love the Father besto<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es upon them,</HI> to call them his <HI>Sons,</HI> his <HI>Daughters.</HI> For in the <HI>Male</HI> the <HI>Female</HI> is included, as <HI>Eve</HI> was in <HI>Adam</HI> in the day of his Creation; and was afterward taken out of his side. When God says <HI>my Son,</HI> he means our <HI>Dau'ters</HI> as well as our Sons; for they are equally his: 2 Cor. 6.17. <HI>I will receive you and ye shall be my Sons and Daughters, saith the Lord Almighty. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Son.</HI> God speaks as a Parent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Child. Here is the Affection <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Concern of a Father, which a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ld has no perfect apprehension of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ldren feel not the bowels of their <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>reats till they come to be them∣selves
<PB N="4" REF="003010_0004_0FEF9D5045DB8AD0"/>Parents. God puts on these Bowels, and speaks to the Children of his people, <HI>My Son!</HI> O how en∣dearing and constraining should this his Grace be unto them!</P>
<P N="2">2. LET our young people observe the gracious <HI>Demand</HI> of the great God from them: <HI>Give me thy heart.</HI> How good and acceptable should <HI>this Pre∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>t,</HI> and Commandment be to them! how kind to thee is <HI>this Law!</HI> a Fa∣thers will and heart is in it, which should give it way into thine. For what does a Parent expect and desire of a Child but his Heart! the love, reverence &amp; respect of his Soul! and what has a Child to render unto his Parent, more especially in his minori∣ty, but the love and duty of an obe∣dient <HI>Heart?</HI> — Each <HI>word</HI> here is full of Grace, Endearment and Con∣straint;</P>

<PB N="5" REF="003010_0004_0FEF9D5045DB8AD0"/>of Him, meet for him to re∣ceive at our hands? And what can <HI>God</HI> ask? does he need any thing? &amp; least of all from us? <HI>Lord</HI> how is it? If we <HI>be righte us what do we give him!</HI> We owe our all, and it is only of <HI>his own</HI> that we can give to Him. Our sinful hearts are not fit for his Ac∣ceptance, not worthy to be offer'd to Him. But if he will prepare him∣self an Offering in us and from us, he will graciously accept of it. If he prepares our Hearts and Wills they become our own Act, and a free will Offering to him This is all that he requires and expects of us. God <HI>asks</HI> us when he needs us not at all but we stand in absolute need of Him. We need that He should accept us. Necessity is laid upon us, and wo unto us if we refuse to give ourselves unto God! We have alienated our selves from him, and need to give our selves back unto him. He must give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the heart to give back to him. But <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>et us consider the <HI>thing ask'd.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="6" REF="003010_0005_0FEF9D5200436DB8"/>
2. <HI>THY heart.</HI> i. e. thy Self, thy Soul, thy Person. A part is na<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>d for the whole; but a principal part, the Heart which is the Fountain and chief Instrument of Life to every part of the Body.</P>
<P><HI>THY Heart;</HI> i. e. thy <HI>whole Spirit, Soul and Body.</HI> Thy <HI>Heart,</HI> i. e. thy Love and Affections, with all thy Mind and Strength. It is the <HI>firstand great Commandment</HI> of the Law. The <HI>summary</HI> of all Religion, of all Duty. It is <HI>more than all whole Burnt Offering and Sacrifice.</HI> What does the Lord thy God require of thee but this? to love the Lord thy God with <HI>all</HI> thy Heart and with all thy Soul?</P>
<P>ALL Devotion and Obedience is of the heart. All the Understanding and all the Soul is in it. And every thing else too that belongs to us. The Heart carries all things with it. It gives all with it self. So in Friendship, as <HI>Jonathan</HI> strip't himself, and gave all to <HI>David.</HI> And so in Marriage, the Person and Estate follow the heart.
<PB N="7" REF="003010_0005_0FEF9D5200436DB8"/>All a Mans Interest, Influence and Power, goes with his Heart to the Service of God. His <HI>Children</HI> espe∣cially that ly nearest to his heart, and are among the dearest parts of our selves, our other <HI>Souls,</HI> these a man renders to God with his heart. So <HI>Abraham</HI> circumcised himself and his <HI>Son,</HI> and prayed, <HI>O that he may live in thy sight.</HI></P>
<P><HI>ANGELS</HI> can give to God no more than this, the entire Love and Obedi∣ence of their hearts, <HI>We</HI> may do this, by the help of Divine Grace, as well as they. The difference is, We give back an alienated heart, recovered by Grace; but innocent and perfect Crea∣tures never had their hearts estranged from GOD.</P>
<P>DID ever a <HI>King</HI> make a Law that his Subjects should <HI>love</HI> him, and let him reign in their Hearts? Indeed the Laws of <HI>Nations</HI> ought to be so interpreted, and every wife and good <HI>Prince</HI> desires more to reign in the Heart and Love of his subjects, than <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver their Bodies and Estates. But

I come to the Doc∣trine.</P>
<DIV2 TYPE="doctrine">
<HEAD>DOCT. <HI>IT is the Indispensible Duty of young People to give God their Hearts and Affections,</HI> and to be seriously religious in their early days.</HEAD>
<P>I shall explain and urge this <HI>Doc∣trine</HI> under these Three heads of Ar∣gument. 1. That they owe this unto <HI>the Lord their God</HI> and should in Obe∣dience to Him, and for his Glory give
<PB N="9" REF="003010_0006_0FEF9D55C5D64340"/>their Hearts unto Him. 2. That they owe this unto <HI>Themselves,</HI> and for t<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> sake of their own Souls, their own Interests, present and future, they ought to give God their hearts. 3. That they owe this to <HI>Others;</HI> to the World they live in, to their Relatives and Friends, and to those that come after them; to all that are about them.</P>
<P>THESE are great &amp; weighty <HI>Argu∣ments,</HI> worthy of the attentive Consi∣deration both of Old &amp; Young; their Obligations to <HI>God,</HI> to <HI>Themselves,</HI> and to their <HI>Neighbours;</HI> For on These <HI>hang all the Law &amp; the Prophets.</HI> Mat. 22.40.</P>
<P N="1">1. YOUNG people owe this duty <HI>to the Lord their God,</HI> and should in <HI>Obedience</HI> to Him, and for the sake of his <HI>Honour and Glory,</HI> give him their hearts. Our Obligations are <HI>first</HI> to God. His Will is the Rule his Glory <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he End of our Actions. Your first Consideration must be, what God is in Himself and what he is to Thee? what his Word requires of thee, and
<PB N="10" REF="003010_0007_0FEF9D5852BF31C0"/>what his Glory calls for from thee? what Bonds thou art under unto Him? And you will easily see the <HI>Reasons</HI> from hence resulting, why thou shouldest give thy heart to God while thou art young.

</LIST></P>
<P N="1">GOD <HI>requires</HI> thy heart, &amp; thou owest it to Him in <HI>Obedience</HI> to his Precept and Commandment. The Text is a <HI>Law</HI> and Commandment of the great God, <HI>My son give me,</HI> &amp;c. It is the Duty thou owest to God, what the Lord thy God requires of thee He demands, he challenges thy Heart. He does not ask of thee a thing which thou mayest deny or refuse to him. No; it belongs to thee to obey. He speaks as a <HI>Father</HI> and as a <HI>Lord;</HI> and on both accounts must be <HI>obeyed. I son honours his Father</HI> and obeys him. It is the Will and Pleasure of the great God that thou give him th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> heart in thy youthful days. Eccl. 12. <HI>Remember now thy Creator in the day of thy Youth.</HI> God is the <HI>Sovereign,</HI> and you must sear him from thy youth.
<PB N="11" REF="003010_0007_0FEF9D5852BF31C0"/><HI>Youth</HI> is the age of Submission and O∣bedience, and to be under the govern∣ment of Parents, Masters and Tutors: And wilt not thou be subject to God now in the days of thy youth? Will thy <HI>earthly Father or Mother</HI> require and command thee? and shall they be obeyed by thee? and shall not <HI>God thy Heavenly Father?</HI> Wilt thou shew Reverence to the Father of thy <HI>flesh,</HI> and not be in subjection to God <HI>the Father of thy spirit?</HI> Which should be obeyed? surely God more than man; Man in Obedience to God only. Young people are not of <HI>Age,</HI> save to be <HI>obedient,</HI> and to do as they are di∣rected and required: and will they not be observant of the Will and Di∣rection of the blessed God? are their <HI>Superiors</HI> on Earth something in their eyes, and is <HI>God most High</HI> nothing with them? Say to Him, <HI>My Father, and the Guide of my Youth! speak Lord, For thy servant heareth!</HI> Fit words to be put into the mouth of young Peo∣ple; as <HI>Eli</HI> put them into the mouth
<PB N="12" REF="003010_0008_0FEF9D5AC8D448D0"/>of <HI>Samuel</HI> when the <HI>Lord called the Child.</HI> So God calls our <HI>Children,</HI> He speaks to them, he bids them give <HI>Him their Hearts;</HI> He commands 'en to do this: Do it then and be obedi∣ent: If you do it not, you are a young <HI>Rebel,</HI> bursting the bonds of Natures and breaking that <HI>Yoke</HI> which it is <HI>good to bear from thy</HI> youth. God says to thee, <HI>Son do this:</HI> Will you answer Him, <HI>I will not?</HI> and turn away from Him, and deny his Right and Autho∣rity to command thee? his Dominion and Power over thee? You would not do so by an earthly Parent, Master or Ruler? and how dare you act thus to the blessed God?</P>
<P>THIS is the <HI>first</HI> Argument; <HI>In O∣bedience to God</HI> give Him thy heart, now while thou art young; for He <HI>requires</HI> it of thee.</P>
<P N="2">2. I come to consider Gods <HI>Proprie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> in thee, and his <HI>Right</HI> to thy Heart.

<P N="1">1. GOD has an unalienable <HI>Right</HI> to thy Heart as the Lord thy <HI>Maker, Preserver</HI> and <HI>Benefactor;</HI> and as such thou owest Him this Gift, in Justice and Gratitude. God's Propriety in us arises from his Relation to us, and Benefits done us. For as He has made us what we are, and we receive our Being, Endowments, Preservations and Supplies from Him; so by all these ties of Nature, Justice and Gratitude we are wholly and solely His, and ought to render unto Him all that we are and have; and that as soon as we are capable of doing it. To be sure God speaks here, and bespeaks the hearts of young People, as their natural <HI>Lord,</HI> Ruler, Lawgiver, Judge, and the only Portion of their Souls. He cannot deny Himself, &amp; you must not deny him. He must and will reign; will reign over thee, and would reign in thee; and if thou re∣fuse him the Rule in and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ver thy Soul, thou deniest him his sacred
<PB N="14" REF="003010_0009_0FEF9D5EBA4F46D0"/>Right in a most unjust and ungrateful manner. Here,</P>
<P N="1">1. GOD is thy <HI>Creator,</HI> thy <HI>Maker,</HI> and therefore thy <HI>Proprietor;</HI> and shall he not have thy heart? Why he made it, and he made it for Himself, and never gave it away, nor can he do it. What thou makest is thine, especially what thou hast made of thy own, for thy self; and hast not parted with thy Right in it to another. And shall God be denied this common Justice and Equity, or Right, between man and man? Who formed thy fleshly Heart? and who made thee a Soul and Spirit? who fashioned thy Body in the womb, and who quickned it there with a living Soul? <HI>The Spirit of God hath made thee, and the Inspi∣ration of the Almighty hath given thee life.</HI> Job 32.8. <HI>Thy hands have made me and fashioned me together round a∣bout</HI> Job 10.8.

<P N="2">II. YOUNG people ought to give God their Hearts in point <HI>of duty to Themselves.</HI> For their <HI>own</HI> sake they ought to do this thing, It is their Interest, and their <HI>Happiness</HI> depends on it. Man is a <HI>selfish</HI> Creature. In a <HI>good</HI> sense he is so, and ought to be To. <HI>Angels</HI> are so and it is their W<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣dom &amp; Duty. Our <HI>first</HI> respect must <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e to the Glory of <HI>God</HI> from us, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o his Will respecting us; and <HI>then</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e may and should respect <HI>Our selves,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Happiness in God, and his Fa∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>r and Blessing to us. God is <HI>firstly</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="003010_0021_0FEF9D818E90C280"/>and ultimately regarded in all <HI>this</HI> and we our selves only in the <HI>second</HI> place, and in subordination to his Will and Glory. He has commanded us to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ve this Respect to our selves, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> us with that Principle of <HI>self love</HI> which is invincible. It is his great <HI>Glory</HI> that he has made us to be <HI>happy,</HI> and made it out duty to seek after Happiness. But then our Hap∣piness is found only in the way of Holiness, which is the way of Obedi∣ence to the Will of God, and Devoted ness to the Glory of God, and of ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> coming to the everlasting Enjoyment of God. Wherefore we do most and best <HI>seek our Selves,</HI> by giving ou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> hearts to God.</P>
<P>GOD made us <HI>holy</HI> at first because i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> was our <HI>Blessedness</HI> to be holy. And God has redeemed us from our Sin because they are our <HI>Misery.</HI> Because he would have us again holy and hap∣py he gave <HI>Christ</HI> for us. And no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> as a redeemed People he requires <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> to give him our <HI>Hearts,</HI> and to do <HI>early,</HI> as the <HI>Means</HI> of our true Ha∣piness.
<PB N="39" REF="003010_0021_0FEF9D818E90C280"/>For the <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>lier</HI> it is done we so much the more consult our Happi∣ness. For though he that gives his heart <HI>late</HI> to God shall be happy, yet he that does it in his <HI>Youth</HI> is happier, both as to Body and Soul, Time and Eternity. He shall escape many G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ilts, and enjoy much more of God in this Life; and he lays up the more in store against the World to come; greater degrees of Happiness for ever.</P>
<P>THE Word of God calls thee, <HI>O young Man,</HI> to this <HI>far exceeding Weight of eternal Glory:</HI> in requiring thee now to give him thy heart. This is the Way to it, the Means of it; and therefore thou owest it to thy <HI>self.</HI> God is very <HI>good</HI> to thee in this Pre∣cept. <HI>If thou be wise thou shalt be wise for thy self.</HI> Prov. 9.12. Is it <HI>profita∣ble to God</HI> if thou givest him thy Heart? No: <HI>If thou be righteous what dost thou give Him, &amp;c?</HI> Job 35.7. The Bene∣fit is only to thy Self and Others here on earth. Indeed God is <HI>pleased</HI> and thou art <HI>saved.</HI> He is pleas'd and gratified to see thee saved. He has
<PB N="40" REF="003010_0022_0FEF9D848CE671C8"/>commanded thee, this for <HI>thy Good,</HI> as well as for his <HI>own Glory. Hear it and know it for thy good.</HI> And let it move thee to give thy Heart to God <HI>that his Soul may bless thee.</HI> It is Gods Favour and Blessing that makes Man happy. Gods Heart <HI>toward</HI> us makes us blessed: his heart <HI>turned against</HI> us makes us miserable. Now what can be the way to have God's heart turn∣ed <HI>toward us,</HI> to bless us and make us happy? but this — <HI>to give our Hearts to Him.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREFORE <HI>come ye Children, heark∣en unto me, I will teach you the Fear of the Lord,</HI> and the proper <HI>Motive</HI> to it: Psal. 34.12. <HI>What Man is he that de∣sireth li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e, and loveth many days that he may see good?</HI> let him give his Heart be<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>mes to God and to the ways of Religion, <HI>for the Eyes of the Lord are upon the Righteous, and his Ears are open to their Cry.</HI> And they are hap∣py indeed on whom the <HI>Eyes</HI> of the Lord are, and to whose <HI>Cries</HI> his Ears are open <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Chron. 22.11. <HI>My S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n, the Lord be with thee and prosper thou</HI></P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="003010_0022_0FEF9D848CE671C8"/>
WELL then, It is thine <HI>own</HI> Interest to give God thy heart while thou are young. Thou owest it to thy <HI>Self.</HI> The law of <HI>self love</HI> teaches it to thee. You sin against Self and are your own Enemy if you do not give God your heart betimes. You wrong your own Souls, and injure your own Bodies. You are guilty not only of self-neglect, but of self destruction. You are ig∣norant of, or wretchedly careless a∣bout your present temporal &amp; world∣ly Interest; as well as your spiritual, future and eternal Interests.</P>
<P>To be particular therefore in this <HI>Argument.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IT is thy temporal and worldly In∣terest to give God thy Heart betimes.</HI> God condescends to move us by these <HI>low</HI> and inferior things.

<PB N="42" REF="003010_0023_0FEF9D86320B4F50"/>has therefore joined these things in his Word, as well as in their own Na∣ture; the one to subserve unto and promote the other; and that He might omit no kind of Motive proper to use with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s.

What are all the poor Interests of <HI>Time,</HI> when compared with those of <HI>Eternity?</HI></P>
<P>OUR <HI>Hearts</HI> are made for spiritual and invisible Things, things heavenly and eternal. The <HI>eternal God</HI> is their Portion.

<P>OUR <HI>Hearts</HI> are made to know and love and desire <HI>God, to thirst after the living God,</HI> to chuse Him &amp; seek after

<P>OUR <HI>Heart</HI> were never made for <HI>this World</HI> and the <HI>temporary</HI> passing things of this life.

<P>THE young Person may die to day or to morrow, and if he have not given his Heart to God, what will then become of Him to all Eternity? Or suppose that he may have many Years to abide in the Flesh, yet it is his spiritual everlasting Interest to give his Heart <HI>now</HI> to God, as much as if this night his Soul were to be required of him.

<P>I come now to the <HI>third</HI> and last <HI>Head,</HI> which is,</P>
<P N="3">III. YOUNG people owe <HI>this to O∣thers,</HI> to the <HI>World</HI> they live in, to <HI>all</HI> that are about them, and more es∣pecially
<PB N="62" REF="003010_0033_0FEF9DA795D5A920"/>unto all <HI>Those</HI> that are related so them and concerned in them: For the sake and benefit of <HI>Others</HI> they ought to give their Hearts to God.</P>
<P>THIS is an Argument of great weight also, though it ought to come after the other <HI>two</HI> which have been already named and urged. <HI>God</HI> is first, our <HI>own</HI> Souls are next, and then the Souls of <HI>Others.</HI> The whole <HI>mo∣ral Duty</HI> of man lies in these <HI>three</HI> Branches, our more immediate Duty to <HI>God,</HI> to our <HI>Selves</HI> and to our <HI>Neigh∣bours.</HI> So our <HI>Saviour</HI> and his <HI>Apostle</HI> have taught us; He in his <HI>Gospel,</HI> the Other in his <HI>Epistle.</HI> Mat. 22.37. <HI>Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul: This is the first and great Command. And the second, is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy self. On these two Commandments hang all the Law &amp; the Prophets.</HI> Tit. 2.16. <HI>For the Grace of God that bringeth Salvation hath appear∣ed to all Men, teaching us to live sober∣ly, righteously and godly in this pre∣sent World.</HI> Young People are not
<PB N="63" REF="003010_0033_0FEF9DA795D5A920"/><HI>righteous toward Men,</HI> no more than <HI>godly before God,</HI> unless they give themselves unto God. If they give their Hearts unto the ways of God they are <HI>dutiful</HI> to Him, they are <HI>wise</HI> for themselves, and will be but <HI>just</HI> &amp; righteous to others. God has set us all in mutual <HI>Relations</HI> one to∣ward another, and there are the <HI>Du∣ties</HI> of those Relations to be discharg∣ed; and <HI>pure Religion before God</HI> and <HI>Piety toward Men</HI> lies in the discharge of those Duties. And <HI>young People</HI> stand in various Relations to one and another as much as their <HI>Elders;</HI> and are as much bound by the Law of God to render unto all the Duties of these Relations, as Others are: All <HI>Souls</HI> are Gods to obey him, and the <HI>Law</HI> of God binds all Souls alike to their particular Duties; even the soul of the <HI>Son</HI> and <HI>Daughter</HI> as much as the soul of the <HI>Parent.</HI> Therefore young People cannot be <HI>Religious</HI> be∣fore God, if they be not <HI>Righteous</HI> and dutiful toward all that they stand <HI>re∣lated</HI> unto; whether in a nearer or
<PB N="64" REF="003010_0034_0FEF9DA963ABE5A0"/>more remote Relation. And the Glory of God from them, and their own Happiness and Comfort in their Obedience to God, depends upon their doing their Duty to Others, in their several places and Relations.—God has sent us into the World to do <HI>good</HI> in it, to do good to <HI>all</HI> about us, to be Blessings to them among whom we live, to whom we are related, with whom we have Conversation and Ac∣quaintance. Our very <HI>Children</HI> know that they sustain these and those <HI>Re∣lations,</HI> to their Parents, to their Bre∣thren and Sisters, to their Masters and Teachers, to their Ministers, to their <HI>Rulers,</HI> and to the Church and People of God whereof they are a part; Now if they give their Hearts betimes to God then and then only they will answer all the Duty of all the Rela<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ons which they stand in to Others For the <HI>Word</HI> of God and the Lo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> &amp; Fear of God teaches them all thes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Duties; and if they refuse their Heart<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to God, to his Word &amp; Ways, then the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> will never do their Duty to other<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="65" REF="003010_0034_0FEF9DA963ABE5A0"/>according to his Will and Command∣ment: And therefore <HI>young</HI> People owe this unto <HI>Others</HI> that they give their Hearts now to <HI>God</HI> because then and not till then will they be just and <HI>righteous</HI> to all about them, whether <HI>Superiors, Inseriours</HI> or <HI>Equals.</HI></P>
<P>My <HI>Text</HI> points me to <HI>this</HI> Argu∣ment with young People, that for the sake of <HI>Others</HI> and particularly of their <HI>Parents</HI> they should give their hearts to God. For thus runs the <HI>Context, My son if thy heart be wise my heart shall rejoice even MINE; thy Father and thy Mother shall be glad, and she that bare thee shall rejoice. Solomon</HI> speaks here as a <HI>Father,</HI> and says to his <HI>Son,</HI> My Son! for <HI>my</HI> sake give thy heart to God, do it for thy <HI>Mo∣thers</HI> sake as well as mine; <HI>We</HI> com∣mand thee to do this; do it in obedi∣ence both to God and <HI>us;</HI> and do it for <HI>our</HI> good, for <HI>our</HI> Comfort and Be∣nefit, for the <HI>Joy</HI> that it will give to <HI>us;</HI> to see thee wise and good and happy. — You see then that I must for∣get my <HI>Text</HI> and depart from <HI>that,</HI> if
<PB N="66" REF="003010_0035_0FEF9DAE4A7AEC20"/>I do not pursue <HI>this</HI> Argument a lit∣tle, and move <HI>young</HI> People to give their hearts to God, for the sake of <HI>O∣thers,</HI> that so <HI>they</HI> may have Comfort in them, and Good from them.</P>
<P>I say therefore again, <HI>Young People owe this to Others,</HI> to the World they live in, to those they are more nearly related to, and unto all about them that they give their Hearts unto God. — And to be particular, and to begin where Nature and my Text teaches me to begin,</P>
<P N="1">1. YOUNG people owe this unto their <HI>Parents,</HI> to give their Hearts be∣times to God. They owe it to their godly Parents as an Act of Obedience to their Commands; and as an early Requital of all their Love to them, and Pains and Cares and Prayers for them. They owe them this <HI>Joy; for the Father of the Righteous shall greatly rejoice, and he that heget<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eth a wise son shall have joy of him.</HI> Prov. 10.1. <HI>A wise Son maketh a glad Father, but a foo∣lish Son is the heaviness of his Mother.</HI> Here is an <HI>Argument</HI> with Children

And what can they do to com∣fort them and make their Hearts glad like this, to let them see the Fear and Love of God in them while they are young? How will they, like <HI>Mary,</HI> lay up all they see of this in their Hearts; and give God Praise for it? For what is a Parents hope, or joy, or <HI>Crown of Rejoicing?</HI> or what should it be, but <HI>this!</HI> even the <HI>Grace</HI> of God in their Children? the Earnest of their seeing them hereafter in the Presence of the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> at his Coming!

So <HI>Joseph</HI> went down a sold servant to <HI>Egypt,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> he had given his heart to God,
<PB N="70" REF="003010_0037_0FEF9DB470D77AA0"/>and was prudent and diligent in hi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Masters business, for he <HI>feared God; and God blessed the Egyptians house for Josephs sake.</HI> Gen. 39.5. — And so it will be always good for a <HI>Family</HI> to have such young People come into Service in it; who have given their hearts to God and his Ways; they will set themselves to do their Duty, in their place, to their <HI>Master</HI> and <HI>Mistress,</HI> to the <HI>Children</HI> of the house, and to their <HI>Fellow servants, in single∣ness of heart, fearing God.</HI> And such Servants are an unknown Blessing in a Family. And for <HI>this</HI> reason, among others, young People should give their hearts to God, that they may be Bles∣sings to the Families where they may go to serve. Read what a <HI>Blessing</HI> re∣ligious <HI>Servants</HI> are to a Family, and what an <HI>Argument</HI> it should be with young People in their Services to be religious that they may be such Bles∣sings; <HI>Eph.</HI> 6.5, 6, 7. <HI>Col.</HI> 3.22, 23, 24.</P>
<P N="4">4. And lastly, YOUNG people should give their hearts to God, <HI>for the s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>
<PB N="71" REF="003010_0037_0FEF9DB470D77AA0"/>of the Generation which they are to serve by the Will of God,</HI> if they live. Young people should not build upon living <HI>long;</HI> but they ought to pre∣pare and lay in for a godly Life of Service to God and Good to Men, if it should please God to <HI>prolong</HI> their lives. And in order to this the short <HI>Rule</HI> before them is this in my <HI>Text, My Son, give God thy heart,</HI> Thou wilt then give thy self to his People according to his will, to do good in the place wherein his Providence sets thee; that thou mayest be a Blessing both in <HI>Church</HI> and <HI>State.</HI> If a young Person has given God his heart, he is like to make a grave, prudent, ju∣dicious, faithful Man in his civil Ca∣pacity and Relations, and into what∣ever public Offices he may be called. And in like manner he that gives his Heart young to God is like to be a <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hining exemplary useful Christian <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Church of Christ. Both in <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tate</HI> and <HI>Church,</HI> he will be seen and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bserved with a raye of <HI>Moses</HI> shining <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>e upon him. So <HI>Joseph</HI> having
<PB N="72" REF="003010_0038_0FEF9DB610D73FB0"/>given his heart early to God, what a Blessing was he made to the <HI>World,</HI> and unto <HI>Israel?</HI> And so we may say of <HI>Moses</HI> &amp; of <HI>Joshua;</HI> and of <HI>Samuel</HI> and <HI>David;</HI> and of <HI>Daniel.</HI> The Lu∣minaries, and Glories, and great Be∣nefactors to the World, have been such as have given their hearts young to God. In <HI>These,</HI> in their measure after <HI>Christ,</HI> (from the Spirit of Christ dwelling and ruling in them) has been exemplified that Blessing of bles∣sings, the Glory of the Son Himself in our Nature; <HI>In thee the Families of the Earth are blessed.</HI> And what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Motive</HI> and Reason should <HI>this</HI> be to young People? that they may be great <HI>Blessings</HI> in their places as long as they live, even unto old Age if God should spare them to it.</P>
<P>AND thus for the sake of <HI>Others</HI> you should give your hearts to God while you are young.</P>
<P>HAVING now gone thro' the seve∣ral <HI>Arguments</HI> I proposed, and show<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> that young people owe this Duty <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>
<PB N="73" REF="003010_0038_0FEF9DB610D73FB0"/><HI>God,</HI> to <HI>Themselves,</HI> and to the <HI>World</HI> they live in;</P>
<P>I come now to make some <HI>Improve∣ment and Application of the Doctrine.</HI> and it may be in three or four <HI>Uses,</HI> of Examination, of Reprehension, of Consolation, and of Exhortation.</P>
<P N="1">1. OF <HI>Examination,</HI> and serious <HI>Self-Enquiry.</HI> Have we yet given our hearts to God? <HI>Child,</HI> hast thou done it? and you that are <HI>Parents</HI> did you do it in your younger days? or is it done even to this day? And should you not do it <HI>now?</HI> Should it not have been done many a Day, or Month, or Year past? and <HI>when</HI> shall it be done? when <HI>shall it once be?</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Use</HI> is of <HI>Reprehension</HI> to all such as have not given their hearts to God, whether Elder or Younger Persons. The <HI>youngest</HI> among us are very wicked and miserable if they have not yet given their hearts to God. Our Children may not excuse themselves or think God will excuse
<PB N="74" REF="003010_0039_0FEF9DBA1C24A6A0"/>it in them. They may and should see their own vile Nature, the <HI>Plague of their hearts,</HI> how vitiated and de∣praved their Minds are, alienated from God, and Enmity against him. It is a desperately wicked heart of thine, or it would give it self to the blessed God. It is a <HI>cursed</HI> heart that <HI>departeth</HI> from the Lord its God. —But then how criminal and guilty are <HI>Elder</HI> People, under the power of this <HI>evil</HI> Heart; and in the same <HI>gall of bitterness and bond of Iniquity!</HI> Our Children are to be bewailed under it, but much more our <HI>Adult people.</HI> As <HI>Moses</HI> lamented over the Children of <HI>Israel,</HI> Deut. 29.4. <HI>Yet the Lord hath not given you a Heart to perceive, nor Eyes to see, nor an Ear to hear unto this day.</HI> How wretched is their case that have lived <HI>long</HI> in the world, but all their days <HI>without God in it!</HI> that are just going <HI>out</HI> of the world and have <HI>never</HI> given their hearts to God! It is a hard word to the <HI>young∣est</HI> sinner, but should sound terribly to the <HI>Older; Of the Rock that bega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="75" REF="003010_0039_0FEF9DBA1C24A6A0"/>thee thou art unmindful, and hast for∣gotten God that formed thee.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. THE next <HI>Use</HI> is of <HI>Consolation,</HI> to all them that have given their hearts to God, but especially them that have done it in their <HI>younger</HI> days. If it is done at all, tho' done late, blessed be <HI>God</HI> for it, and blessed be <HI>thou</HI> of the Lord thy God. Happy is he that can say with the Apostle, 1 Cor. 15.8. <HI>Last of all He was seen of me also, as of one born out of due time.</HI> But happier is he that can say with Him, <HI>My manner of life from my Youth up,</HI> has shown a heart given to God. Happy was <HI>Obadiah,</HI> who could say of himself, 1 King. 18.12. <HI>I thy servant fear the Lord from my Youth.</HI> Let the Mouths of such be filled with God's Praise and Honour all the day. — Happy is the <HI>young</HI> person that has given his heart to God; whether he lives to <HI>serve</HI> God in this World, or whether he dies and goes to <HI>enjoy</HI> him in a better. <HI>Of such is the Kingdom of Heaven;</HI>
<PB N="76" REF="003010_0040_0FEF9DBD30CBF568"/>the Kingdom of Grace here, and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Glory hereafter. Where ever <HI>Jesu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣sees</HI> any such young People he <HI>loves</HI> them; and such <HI>Children be takes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the Arms</HI> of his Grace and Cove∣nant, and <HI>blesses 'em.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. THE last Use is of <HI>Exhortation;</HI> and let it be directed to all, both <HI>elder</HI> &amp; <HI>younger</HI> Persons, as the Voice of God to them; <HI>Give God your hearts.</HI> What a gracious Exhortation is this, which speaketh to us as unto <HI>Chil∣dren?</HI> for surely it is a <HI>Father</HI> that asks of us our <HI>hearts.</HI> Who can refuse <HI>this</HI> to God? For let us consider,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. <HI>GOD only has Right to our hearts.</HI> To whom shall we give them, if not Him? What has sin or satan, the world or flesh, to do with these hearts of ours? God that made us <HI>this Soul,</HI> made it for <HI>Himself</HI> He fill'd the heart of Man at first with Himself, and fix'd it on Himself, and He has redeemed it for Himself. He claims but his <HI>Own,</HI> and <HI>of his Own we give Him,</HI> when we give him our Hearts.</ITEM>
<ITEM><PB N="77" REF="003010_0040_0FEF9DBD30CBF568"/>
2. <HI>THY Heart is too great and good I thing for any thing below God.</HI> It is I <HI>Spirit,</HI> and made for spiritual Bles∣sedness: It is a <HI>living</HI> and immortal spirit and made for a blessed Immor∣tality. This <HI>World</HI> therefore, with all the <HI>Objects of sense</HI> which it is filled with, is not <HI>suted</HI> to nor <HI>suffi∣cient</HI> for thy Heart. <HI>These</HI> are not great, good or durable eno' to fill and satisfy <HI>that.</HI> Wherefore <HI>reverence thy self; know ye not their own selves?</HI> that you are <HI>spirits</HI> and not <HI>flesh;</HI> like the horses and cattle about your doors, to feed &amp; live upon the husks of this World; and that you are <HI>im∣mortal</HI> Spirits, made for a future and eternal World. You must not there∣fore bow down to this <HI>stock,</HI> nor sa∣crifice your Hearts to these empty and transitory things, nor prostitute your noble Souls to trifles and child∣ish Vanities? to Riches and Honours which neither improve nor satisfy the Souls of Men while they <HI>live,</HI> nor can descend after them when they <HI>die?</HI> Or wilt thou give thy Heart to
<PB N="78" REF="003010_0041_0FEF9608987713A8"/>those ways of Sin and Wickedness, which render this Life miserable, and which end in Hell and eternal Dam∣nation? Surely thy <HI>Heart</HI> is too good to give it to the <HI>devil;</HI> and yet in effect thou givest it to <HI>him</HI> if it be not given to <HI>God.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>3. CONSIDER that <HI>you owe your heart to CHRIST, who has died to pur∣chase it for God;</HI> to redeem it from Sin, to recover it from the devil, to purify it for God: Thou art <HI>bought with a Price,</HI> therefore <HI>glorify God with thy Body and Spirit.</HI> 1 Cor. 6.20. Thy whole Spirit Soul and Body is due to <HI>Him,</HI> who gave Himself a <HI>Ransom</HI> for thee; who made his Soul an <HI>Of∣fering,</HI> who thro' the <HI>Eternal Spirit</HI> offered up himself without spot to God! He claims thy Heart, for he has dearly bought it with his Blood, to sanctify and cleanse it, for an Ha∣bitation of God, a living <HI>Temple</HI> and a living <HI>Sacrifice.</HI> Rom. 12.1. <HI>I be∣seech you therefore Brethren, by the Mercies of God, that ye present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, accepta∣ble
<PB N="79" REF="003010_0041_0FEF9608987713A8"/>unto God, which is your reasonable service.</HI> 14.7. <HI>For none of us liveth to himself, and no man dieth to himself; for whether we live, we live unto the Lord: and whether we die, we die unto the Lord: whether we live therefore or die, we are the Lords. For to this end Christ both died, and rose, and revived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and living.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. LET young people consider that <HI>they have been given to God in Bap∣tism,</HI> by which they are bound and obliged to give their hearts to God. And now it lies upon them to make this Act and Deed, the <HI>Dedication</HI> of themselves to God; secretly and pub∣lickly. Your Parents and Ministers who have done their part in giving you up to God according to his Ap∣pointment, and all the Lord's People that saw you bro't under the holy Bonds of God in your Baptism; do all join in calling upon you to give your hearts to God And God calls upon you as the Seed of his Covenant People, as a devoted Seed to him, and
<PB N="80" REF="003010_0042_0FEF9DC1C1FE7B98"/>as your Covenant God—<HI>My Children, give me your hearts.</HI> To refuse him is in effect to deny &amp; renounce your <HI>Baptism.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>5. And lastly, <HI>GOD will give Him∣self, his Son and Spirit, his Heaven and Glory, to all them that give their hearts to Him.</HI> He requires our hearts, that he may bestow Himself on us. The Heart of the <HI>Blessed Trinity</HI> is toward thee in this Demand of thy Heart for God; it is that thou mayest be bles∣sed in God, in his Love and Favour, in his Presence and Glory for ever and ever. Give thy heart to God &amp; God will come down into it and pos∣sess it for Himself, and dwell and reign in it, and prepare it for his hea∣venly Glory. Give thy Heart to God, and the Grace of <HI>Christ,</HI> the Love of <HI>God</HI> and the Communion of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> shall be with thy Spirit. Give thy heart to God and <HI>when flesh and heart faileth God will be the Strength of thy heart and thy portion for even.</HI> Give thy Heart to God, and when thou diest God will take thy Spirit
<PB N="81" REF="003010_0042_0FEF9DC1C1FE7B98"/>to Himself; to his Presence where is the fulness of Joy for ever and ever. All that God has to give, and that thou canst receive, God will give to thee another Day if thou givest thy Heart to him now.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>BY way of <HI>Direction,</HI>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. GIVE thy heart to God, and do it <HI>instantly.</HI> What you do, let it be done <HI>quickly,</HI> forthwith, presently. Do it <HI>now: To day if you will hear his Voice.</HI> Delay not in a matter of this Importance. To <HI>morrow</HI> may be too late; you may be dead before it <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>omes; <HI>This night may thy Soul be re∣quired.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2. GIVE thy heart to God and give <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>wholly</HI> to him. He requires of thee <HI>all</HI> thy Heart and all thy Soul. He <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a right to It <HI>all,</HI> He will not ac∣cept of a <HI>part,</HI> a divided heart. His Glory forbids it.

Thy <HI>Soul and all
<PB N="82" REF="003010_0043_0FEF9DC5D77EE868"/>that is within thee,</HI> thy <HI>whole Spirit, Soul and Body;</HI> This is God's claim.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. GIVE thy heart to God &amp; give it <HI>for ever</HI> to him. It is a <HI>living</HI> im∣mortal Spirit, that thou rendrest to the <HI>living</HI> God, the everlasting King. Thy heart must be given absolutely and irrevocably. This is my God, and my Heart shall be his for ever and ever. Come and let us joyn out selves to the Lord in an everlasting Covenant, never to be forgotten. You are acting for Time &amp; Eternity.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. GIVE thy heart to God and do it <HI>joyfully and thankfully.</HI> It is thy greatest Honour and Happiness that he will <HI>accept</HI> of thy poor heart, and that thou hast a heart <HI>inclined</HI> to give it self to him. <HI>Who am I, O Lord God! and what is my People,</HI> that we should be allowed to <HI>effer so wil∣lingly after this sort!</HI> Thy heart! it is a wonder of Grace that God should allow thee to make a Tender of it to Him. If he has prepar'd it for Him∣self it will be a most willing Offer∣ing a Thank offering.</ITEM>
<PB N="83" REF="003010_0043_0FEF9DC5D77EE868"/>
<ITEM>5. GIVE thy Heart to God and give it <HI>to his People,</HI> in all his ap∣pointed Ways. <HI>Give your own selves first to the Lord, and then to Us by the Will of God;</HI> As the Apostle speaks; 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 8.5. Give thy self to God and come into his <HI>Church,</HI> and be walking in all the Commandments and Ordi∣nances of the Lord blameless. As <HI>Ruth</HI> clave to <HI>Naomi</HI> and her People, having given her self to the God of Israel: Ruth 1.16. <HI>Entreat me nor to leave thee, nor to turn from follow∣ing after thee; for thy People shall be my People, and thy God my God.</HI> Let our young People show that they have given their Hearts to God by coming into full Communion; and by con∣tinuing sted fastly (all their Life) in the Fellowship of the Saints. Give your Hearts to God and it will bring you on to the <HI>Table</HI> of Christ, and make you welcome there. Yea when you have given your Heart to God, you may <HI>give Thanks unto the Father who hath made you meet for the Inhe∣ritance of the Saints in Light.</HI></ITEM>

<P>THE <HI>Words</HI> are quoted from an <HI>Heathen Poet, Aratus,</HI> by the Apostle <HI>Paul</HI> in an excellent Discourse which he made to the Men of <HI>Athens,</HI> to con∣vince them of their Folly and Impie∣ty
<PB N="86" REF="003010_0045_0FEF9DCD9D6EA718"/><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in the <HI>Idolatry</HI> which he saw among <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>em. It is a very rare thing in the holy Writings to find a Quotation from a <HI>heathen Author;</HI> It is (as <HI>On</HI> says) like the bringing <HI>a Greek into the Temple.</HI> Yet certainly in the Case before us the Propriety and Wisdom of the thing is evident; it being a∣dapted to the Persons spoken unto, and an Argument <HI>ad Hominem,</HI> to convince and shame 'em out of their Idolatry, from what one of their own <HI>Poets</HI> had written.</P>
<P>THE Apostle being now at <HI>Athens,</HI> one of the famous Cities of <HI>Greece,</HI> was exceedingly <HI>moved to see the City given wholly to Idolatry.</HI> Among other wild and absurd Instances of their Superstitious Devotion, he found <HI>one Altar</HI> erected and inscribed <HI>to the un∣known God.</HI> They had collected and gathered (it may be) the Images and Pictures of all the Gods of the Nations that had come to their know Iedge; but well imagining with themselves that they had not light upon them all, they would have <HI>One</HI>

<P>HERE then let me premise, and say,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE are <HI>not</HI> the Offspring of God in the highest fe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se, which is sin∣gular &amp; peculiar to the <HI>Only begotten and eternal Son.</HI> There is an <HI>Only-begotten of the Father;</HI> a S<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n by an eternal Generation; <HI>His only Son our Lord.</HI> He is a Divine Person, his Na∣ture and Glory is Divine. Joh. 1.1. <HI>In the beginning was the WORD, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</HI> ver. 14. <HI>And the Word w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> made Hesh, and dwelt among us, and
<PB N="91" REF="003010_0047_0FEF9DD2669BA6D8"/>we beheld his Glory, the Glory as of the Only begotten of the Father.</HI> O this eternal Existence of <HI>Christ,</HI> the Wisdom and Power of God, we read Prov. 8.22. <HI>The Lord possessed Me in the be∣ginning of his ways, before his Works of old: I was set up from Everlasting, from the Beginning, or ever the Earth was: Then I was by Him, as one bro t up with Him, and I was daily his de∣light, rejoicing a ways before Him: re∣joicing in the habitable parts of the Earth, and my Delights were with the Sons of Men.</HI> This <HI>Divine Offspring</HI> of God is so by an Ineffable everlasting Com∣munication of Essence, <HI>having Life in Himself, even as the Father bath life in Himself.</HI> He and the Father <HI>are One,</HI> in Essence, in Glory and Power. Joh. 10.30. <HI>I and my Father are One.</HI> His glory is incomprehensible and incom∣municable. Phil. 2.6. <HI>Who being in the Form of God tho't it not robbery to be Equal with God.</HI> Heb. 1.3. <HI>The Bright∣ness of the Fathers Glory, and the ex∣press Image of his Person.</HI> Col. 2.9.
<PB N="92" REF="003010_0048_0FEF9DD420F07308"/><HI>In Him dwelleth all the Fulness of the Godhead bodily.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is <HI>the Mystery of God; of the Father &amp; of Christ;</HI> which we receive and adore, as it is revealed and be∣cause it is revealed, without pretend∣ing to comprehend it. Prov. 30 4. <HI>What is his Name, and what is his Sons Name, if thou canst tell?</HI> No, we must answer, <HI>I neither learned Wis∣dom, nor have the Knowledge of the Holy.</HI> Far be it from us. (and as far is it above all <HI>Angels</HI>) to call our selves <HI>the Offspring of God</HI> in such a sense; Far b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Tho't from us, and detest∣ed by us. The Only begotten Son it <HI>Christ,</HI> whose Name is above every Name, and Angels in Heaven as well as we on Earth <HI>how</HI> down before it.</P>
<P N="2">2. WE are the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God e∣minently or only in our <HI>Souls,</HI> not call'd so with respect to our <HI>Bodies</HI> or outward Form. When the Crea∣tion of Man came on, the Crown and finishing peice of God's Creation here below, the Lord God said — <HI>Let us <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ks Man in our Image, ofter our like∣ness:</HI>
<PB N="93" REF="003010_0048_0FEF9DD420F07308"/>and he formed the <HI>Body</HI> of Man out of the <HI>dust</HI> of the Ground, and breathed into his Nostrils <HI>the Breath of Life, and Man became a Liv∣ing Soul.</HI> Mans Body is a wondrous peice of Divine Workmanship, and great is the glory of the Wisdom and Power and Bounty of the CREATOR shining in it. But the living <HI>Soul</HI> or <HI>Spirit</HI> which God breathed into this Body, bears the Image of the wise, eternal ever living SPIRIT, whose breath it is. God is the <HI>Father of Spirits.</HI> Angels and Souls, intelligent and immortal Beings, are his <HI>Off∣spring;</HI> and not Bodies. <HI>There is a Spirit in Man, and the Inspiration of the Almighty giveth him Understanding. Souls are His, all</HI> Souls are so; his Offspring in his Image.</P>
<P>AND this is the manner of Reason∣ing in our <HI>Context;</HI> that it is absurd to worship the invisible and immense. SPIRIT, that <HI>gives to all Life and Breath and all things,</HI> under any dead and bodily Form, whether of Man or Beast; for <HI>in HIM we live &amp; move,</HI>
<PB N="94" REF="003010_0049_0FEF9DD6C80851F8"/>being made living Souls by Him and active Spirits, <HI>and so his Offspring.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. IT must moreover be premised &amp; considered, That <HI>Angels</HI> and humane <HI>Souls,</HI> though vastly in their Nature excelling Bodies and bearing the I∣mage of the Invisible God; yet they are as much at last the <HI>Creatures</HI> of God and infinitely <HI>below</HI> Him, as any and every part of the inferior World. At last the distance is infinite be∣tween God and the highest created Intelligence. There is no propor∣tion between Finite and Infinite: there is no measuring that which is Eternal and which is Immense. An eternal Existence is just the same to a million Years before the World, as to a million after it: And so is an immense Presence just the same to the Heaven of heavens and to this House which we are in. That is to say, There is neither greater not less if compared to Infinity: the Heaven of heavens do no more contain God than this Room can. In like manner the highest created Beings are but
<PB N="95" REF="003010_0049_0FEF9DD6C80851F8"/>Creatures, and the least Worm or Mire is one of Gods Creatures. If therefore some of God's Creatures are call'd his Offspring, what then? they are never the less as much below the eternal and immense <HI>Creator,</HI> as the least and lowest thing that he has made. Wherefore <HI>He putteth no Trust in his Angels, he charge them with Folly, they cover their Faces before Him; the Heavens are not clean in his sight.</HI> And as for the Spirits in Flesh, what are they but <HI>Dust and Ashes</HI> be∣fore Him? as <HI>Abraham</HI> beheld him∣self, when God spake to him, and gave him leave to speak before him. — As our <HI>Context</HI> has it, — <HI>God that made the World and all things in it, see∣ing he is Lord of Heaven and Earth,</HI> is as much above the highest as the least of his Creatures. So then, al∣though our Souls are the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God, yet pride must be hid from Man, and he is before his Maker but a Worm of the dust. <HI>Lucifer,</HI> the Son of the Morning, in his high state
<PB N="96" REF="003010_0050_0FEF961120DF5438"/>grew proud, not considering that his distance from the Throne of the <HI>Ma∣jesty on High,</HI> was as great as if he had been the least of Angels or only a Spirit here below in flesh; and so he fell —. But having said <HI>this</HI> to keep us low under the Priviledges of our Nature and the Favours of God to us; I come now to say,</P>
<P N="4">4. YET it pleases the High God to <HI>call</HI> some of his Creatures <HI>his Off∣spring,</HI> and to require them so to ac∣count of &amp; esteem Themselves. <HI>For we are his Offspring.</HI></P>
<P>ANGELS and Men may say this. They <HI>both</HI> are so. God calls them so, owns them so, puts them among his Children.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>ANGELS</HI> are the <HI>Sons</HI> of God. Job 38.7. <HI>When the Morning Stars sang together and all the Sons of God shouted for Joy.</HI> i. e. The Angels did so when God made this Earth of ours. The blessed Angels are among Crea∣tures, the <HI>First born of the Father of lights;</HI> and they shone bright in the <HI>Morning</HI> of time; before that God
<PB N="97" REF="003010_0050_0FEF961120DF5438"/>commanded <HI>the Light to shine out of Darkness</HI> here below. They saw God rear the Earth for Men their younger <HI>Brethren,</HI> immortal Spirits like themselves; and they rejoiced at it; (in the habitable parts where∣of the <HI>Son</HI> of God was before re∣joicing.) The holy <HI>Angels</HI> shine bright in the <HI>Image</HI> of God; love him as their <HI>Father,</HI> he delights in them as his <HI>Sons,</HI> their delight is to do his <HI>Will,</HI> they dwell in his <HI>House</HI> above, and they inherit everlasting Life and Light.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>MAN</HI> was created a <HI>Son</HI> of God as well as the Angels. So we read, Luk. 3. ult. <HI>Adam, which was the Son of God. He</HI> was immediately the Off∣spring of God in his Creation; <HI>We</HI> are mediately, Deut. 32.6. <HI>Is he not thy Father? hath he not made thee?</HI> Mal. 2.10. <HI>Have we not all our Father? hath not one God created us?</HI></P>
<P>Now there are two Reasons why Angels and men should be called the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God, more than the other
<PB N="98" REF="003010_0051_0FEF9DDA206EA0A8"/>inferior Creatures which God has made.
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. They are made more <HI>in the Image and Likeness of God</HI> than the inferior Creatures. And</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. They are in an eminent &amp; exalted sense made <HI>for God,</HI> his Service and Praise more than the other Creatures.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. They are <HI>treated by God in a peculiar man∣ner</HI> as his Offspring.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P N="1">I. ANGELS and Men are the <HI>Off∣spring</HI> of God because they are made more in the <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Likeness</HI> of God than the inferior Creatures are. This is the Distinction that God put, and the Difference he made, in the Creation of other Creatures and of Man: <HI>Let us make Man</HI> (said He) <HI>in our Image and likeness.</HI> Which means not that the inferior Creatures do not bear the manifest stamp of God's Wisdom, Power and Goodness upon them; They evidently do so, and <HI>His eternal Power and Godhead are clearly seen in the things which are made.</HI> But in Man there is the Image of God's Spirituality, Dominion and Government, Knowledge, Rectitude,
<PB N="99" REF="003010_0051_0FEF9DDA206EA0A8"/>Immortality, as is not to be found in the Inferior Creatures.</P>
<P><HI>IMAGE and likeness;</HI> i. e. says One, the likest Image, the nearest Resemblance of any of the visible Creatures: It is this Image of God on Man, this Likeness to God in him, that makes us the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God: As Children bear the Image, and are in the Likeness, of their Parents.</P>
<P>So,</P>
<P N="1">1. WE bear the <HI>Image</HI> and are the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God because we are <HI>liv∣ing Souls and Spirits. God is a Spirit,</HI> Joh. 4.24. <HI>The Lord is that Spirit.</HI> 2 Cor. 3.17. The eternal and infi∣nite Mind; invisible, incorporeal, im∣material, incorruptible; that is GOD. <HI>Material</HI> and visible things cannot give us any Image of God, like things <HI>Spiritual</HI> which only fall under the discerning of our Minds, which are Spirits, and capable of Spiritual O∣perations. In his we are like <HI>God,</HI> that our Souls are Spiritual Substan∣ces; that there is a <HI>Spirit in Man;</HI> invisible, incorruptible, immortal; a
<PB N="100" REF="003010_0052_0FEF9DDBD3B201E8"/>Power &amp; Principle intelligent, active, free, self-conscious: God made us <HI>this Soul,</HI> and herein we resemble God, whose Spirituality and Simpli∣city of Essence is infinitely above the Nature of created Spirits, as these are above stupid and gross Matter.</P>
<P N="2">2. We bear the <HI>Image</HI> and are the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God because <HI>intelligent and rational</HI> Creatures. We are <HI>Minds;</HI> God has given us Knowledge and Understanding. Man is a Spiri∣tual Intellect, as the Angels of Hea∣ven also are Intelligences. <HI>The Inspi∣ration of the Almighty has given Us an Understanding.</HI> An Understanding to know HIM, and to form Ideas of things spiritual, invisible, immateri∣al &amp; eternal. In <HI>this</HI> we must needs see &amp; consider the Image of God up∣on us. Job. 35.10. <HI>Where is God my Maker, who teacheth us more than the Beasts of the field, and hath made us wiser than the Fowls of Heaven?</HI> The <HI>LORD is a God of Knowledge;</HI> Angels bear his Image in their Knowledge and Wisdom, and so doth Man on
<PB N="101" REF="003010_0052_0FEF9DDBD3B201E8"/>Earth, Col. 3.10. <HI>Created after God in Knowledge. Christ</HI> the express I∣mage of the <HI>Father</HI> has his Name, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> the <HI>Word</HI> and <HI>Wisdom.</HI> So Man is a thinking reasoning Creature. And <HI>this Spirit of Man is the Candle of the Lord,</HI> Prov. 20.27. As a Candle is light from some Fire, and then shines and gives light it self.</P>
<P N="3">3 WE bear the <HI>Image</HI> and are the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God, in our <HI>Will, Freedom, Election and Choice,</HI> in our Actions. We are Agents by Counsel. We judge, deliberate, advise, chuse o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> refuse; upon reasoning and consider∣ing of things. This is the property of a spiritual &amp; intellectual Nature, and shows very much of God's Image on us. Hence we are capable of mo∣ral Perfection; Virtue, Grace, Good∣ness: A Mind rightly disposed and inclined to chuse the Good &amp; refuse the Evil. This was the Image of God at first on man: <HI>God made him spright.</HI> Eccl. 7.29 God made him <HI>holy,</HI> beheld him very <HI>good,</HI> and forbad him to <HI>Sin.</HI> And this is the Image
<PB N="102" REF="003010_0053_0FEF9DE045434A40"/>of God in Man restored by Grace <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Eph. 4.24. <HI>Created after God in Righ∣teousness and true Holiness.</HI> We are made to be good, and do good, and love the things that are holy and good: As to know God and his Will so to please and obey Him; to place our Affection on him, and to chuse the things that please him. <HI>This</HI> the inferior Creatures are not capable of; They have neither knowledge not will for moral Government; the Go∣vernment of themselves; to be rul'd by a Law proposed to them. They are not capable of chufing for them∣selves, or of yeilding Obedience to Another; from a sense of Duty; and because what he commands is wise and right, just and good.</P>
<P N="4">4. MAN is made for <HI>Dominion and Rule,</HI> and therein bears the <HI>Image</HI> and appears to be the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God, The Words of the Great CREATOR are very remarkable about the for∣mation of Man; <HI>Let us make Man i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Our Image, after our likeness, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him have Dominion</HI> over the inferio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="103" REF="003010_0053_0FEF9DE045434A40"/>Creatures. God is the Lord, Proprietor and Possessor, Ruler and Governour of all things. Man as the Offspring of God bears <HI>this</HI> part of God's Image, that he was made Lord, Proprietor and Governour of the Earth, and the Creatures on it. The <HI>Begotten Son</HI> is <HI>the Heir and Lord of all</HI> things, visible and invisible. Of the <HI>Angels</HI> we read that they are <HI>Thrones</HI> and <HI>Dominions, Principalities</HI> and <HI>Powers:</HI> And their Agency, Influence and Rule in the Kingdom of Nature and Grace, and over the Kingdoms and in the Hearts of Men, may be much more than we conceive of: But Man the Offspring of God on <HI>Earth</HI> has <HI>that</HI> for his Pos∣session and Dominion. He should be Lord of <HI>Himself,</HI> and have the domi∣nion of his own Soul; and then act as God's Representative and Vice-toy in the use of the <HI>Creation.</HI> He is made and accomplish'd for his Place and Dominion by the supreme Power; and then limited in it, as it is meet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> should be. He must rule for God, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le Himself &amp; reign over the Crea∣tures
<PB N="104" REF="003010_0054_0FEF9DE3B83553F8"/>of God. They are not endowed to fear and serve God, but are made to serve <HI>Man,</HI> whose <HI>Fear</HI> is put by God upon them. <HI>Gen.</HI> 9.2. By the Government of <HI>himself</HI> Man shines in the <HI>moral</HI> Image of God, and by his Possession and Use of the <HI>Creature</HI> he bears the Image of Gods <HI>visible</HI> and universal Government.</P>
<P N="5">5. MAN bears the <HI>Image</HI> and is the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God in his <HI>Immortality. GOD</HI> is the <HI>King Immortal;</HI> He <HI>only hath Immortality.</HI> He is <HI>to Everlasting.</HI> In like manner <HI>Angels</HI> are immortal Spirits; they liue for ever, can ne∣ver die. <HI>Man</HI> was indeed from his Original Make and Constitution ca∣pable of Death. He is a living Soul in a Body of Flesh, or Earth. The Union is wonderful, of things very distant in their own Nature. The Separation of them is therefore the less wonderful. Never the less with∣out the Sin of man it had never been God by his power would have kep<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Soul &amp; Body together if he had no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ed.

<PB N="105" REF="003010_0054_0FEF9DE3B83553F8"/>God let him know it, and told him in the day he eat he should surely find it. Never the less the Soul of Man is an immortal Spirit. That lives when it leaves the body. That is li∣able thenceforth to no other Death than the sinning Angels themselves are under, scil. Guilt &amp; Misery eter∣nal. We read therefore of the Souls <HI>returning</HI> to God that gave it. <HI>Eccl.</HI> 12.7. and of the Spirits of good Men immediately <HI>in Abraham's bosome;</HI> and of the Souls of the wicked in the place of <HI>Torment, Luk.</HI> 16.23. The Soul is the <HI>Man,</HI> and that is as much im∣mortal in its own Nature as any An∣gel in heaven. Herein then it bears the <HI>Image</HI> of the E<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ernal God as much as they, and as much as a Creature <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>an do; for it is <HI>eternal</HI> in its durati∣on, it lives and lasts to all Eternity.

But then too — Immortal, <HI>living Spirits</HI> must needs be in their original State the high <HI>Offspring</HI> of God. These are each of them <HI>as the Children of the King Eter∣nal:</HI> they bear a high Image and Re∣semblance of his Immortality. This is a high Honour and Glory, wherein <HI>Man</HI> is at last not a whit below the <HI>Angels,</HI> those <HI>Sons</HI> of God. They both inherit Glory. Honour &amp; Immortality: <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>e eternal Life.</P>
<P>AND so much for the <HI>fi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>st Reason</HI> why we are called the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God; namely, Because made in the <HI>Image</HI> and <HI>Likeness</HI> of God.</P>
<P N="2">II. WE are the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God, because eminently and in an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ed sense <HI>made for God,</HI> for his Serv<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and Praise, more tha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any other Crea∣tures here on Earth. The Offspring <HI>belongs</HI> to the Parents; so we among

<P>Here, 1. IT is true that all things are Created for the Glory and Praise of God. <HI>Of Him, and to Him, are all things,</HI> Rom. 11.36. <HI>For his Glory they are &amp; were.

Every Creature of God bears more o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> less the Stamp &amp; Impress of his Image; of his Wisdom, Power &amp; Goodness; which declare it to belong to God and to be made for his Praise. Job. 12.7. <HI>Ask now the Beasts and they shall teach thee, and the Fowls of the Air and they shall tell thee; or speak to the Earth and it shall teach thee, and the Fishes of the Sea shall declare unto thee: Who knoweth not in all these that the Hand of the Lord hath wro't this? in whose Hand is the Soul of every living thing, and the Breath of all Mankind.</HI> Go to any Creature of God on Earth and you will see the <HI>Perfections</HI> of God shining forth in it.

<P N="2">2. BUT in a more special Manner and in a higher sense <HI>Mankind are made for G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d,</HI> his Glory, Praise and Service.

<P>BESIDES, the <HI>Offspring</HI> elected un∣to Salvation, are a <HI>vast number</HI> of these precious Souls; and the <HI>Salvation</HI> to be procured for them was from spiri∣tual &amp; eternal Miseries, unto infinite and eternal Glories.

<PB N="144" REF="003010_0074_0FEF9E1F29E29090"/>by Him God formed them.

<P>THE Redemption being of a <HI>fallen Offspring,</HI> to make them again Chil∣dren; to restore them again into <HI>the Liberty of the Sons of God;</HI> the eternal <HI>Son</HI> himself became the Redeemer.

<P>HERE then is a worthy Reason wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Christ has done so much for our Re∣demption; He is the eternal Son <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd

<P N="6">6. ARE we the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God? see how <HI>the Grace of God by Jesus Christ, as revealed in the Gospel; agrees both to the Original and lapsed State of Man as it is given us by Moses.</HI> There is an admirable Harmony between the <HI>Two Testaments,</HI> the <HI>Old</HI> and <HI>New;</HI> And they give in a marvellous Light, and bear a strong Testimony, the one to the other. As in the Instance be∣fore us:</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>THE redeeming Mercy of God by Christ admirably agrees to the Doctrine of mans Original State;</HI> that he was made in the Likeness of God, and in his Love, and perfectly good &amp; hap∣py, and in short a <HI>Son</HI> of God. For what is it that Christ by the Gospel proposes, but to recover us into the Favour and Grace of God; and into the Relation, D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gnity and Priviledges
<PB N="146" REF="003010_0075_0FEF9E21093F0CD8"/>of Children to God. For the whole Design and Scope of the Gospel is to make us again the <HI>Children</HI> of God. <HI>This</HI> it proposes to us, the Way to this it reveals to us, and in its saving Ef∣ficacy this it produces in us and for us. It reveals to us a gracious Adop∣tion in Christ, a blessed Way for our Reconciliation to God, by a blessed Regeneration and Renovation passing on us. It tells us of our being <HI>born again, renewed after the Image of God in Knowledge and Holiness;</HI> it shews and teaches the Spirit and Disposition of Children which God is ready to restore in us. It would beget in us the Love of Children to God, &amp; bring us into the ready Obedience of Chil∣dren; and it would bring us into the Communion of Children with God; to be known of God, and lov'd by him; to converse with him, hear his voice, speak to him, walk before him, &amp; live with him for ever and ever. — Thus on the one hand <HI>the Doctrines</HI> of <HI>Gospel Grace</HI> agree unto the Account given
<PB N="147" REF="003010_0075_0FEF9E21093F0CD8"/>us of the <HI>Original State of Man;</HI> that he was made a <HI>Son</HI> in the Image and Love of God.</P>
<P N="2">2. IT agrees also to the Account given us of <HI>Mans Fall and of his lapsed State;</HI> in being a Doctrine &amp; Precept of <HI>Repentance.</HI></P>
<P>FOR if Man be the <HI>Offspring of</HI> God, and be <HI>fallen</HI> from <HI>God,</HI> it must needs be that the way of his Recovery and Return to God be by an ingenuous and deep Repentance: And if God be a <HI>Father</HI> to Man by Nature, as his Crea∣tor, and he will please to become his Father again by <HI>Grace</HI> after his Sin and Fall, we may be assured then of the Sinning Creatures Reception and Pardon upon his Repentance. And ac∣cordingly the Gospel addresses unto lapsed Man.</P>
<P N="1">1. IT invites and calls him to <HI>Re∣pentance.</HI> And 2. It assures him of Gods <HI>Pardoning Mercy</HI> upon his Re∣pentance. A <HI>Penitential Return</HI> to God is the least that can be enjoyned on the <HI>Sinning Offspring;</HI> and the Re∣pentance
<PB N="148" REF="003010_0076_0FEF9E247AD789A0"/>which the Gospel requires is a <HI>filial</HI> Repentance, such as becomes Children to an offended Father: A filial Fear and Shame and Sorrow. So our <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> has represented it in the Parable of the <HI>Prodigal; Luk.</HI> 15 The Sinner is a <HI>Son</HI> that has left the House of a tender and loving <HI>Father,</HI> and acted shamefully to his great Of∣fence and Dishonour; yet at last pinch'd with his <HI>Needs</HI> and with the Sense of his miserable and lost Con∣dition, he bethinks himself of his Sin and Folly, and resolves to <HI>arise and go to his Father,</HI> confess his Fault and beg Forgiveness and cast himself upon his Pity: — <HI>I will say unto Him, Father I have sinned against Heaven and Thee.</HI> You see then that <HI>Evangelical Repen∣tance</HI> is the Holy Sorrow of a fallen <HI>Offspring</HI> in a penitential Return to an offended God and <HI>Father.</HI> — And it must be added, The Gospel assures the <HI>Penitent</HI> of such a Reception from God as an offending Child may look for from a Father upon his Repentance. God pardons like a <HI>Father,</HI> freely,
<PB N="149" REF="003010_0076_0FEF9E247AD789A0"/>fully and for ever; and most tenderly and affectionately. So the Parable represents the <HI>Prodigals</HI> Reception; <HI>While he was yet a great way off the Fa∣ther saw him, and ran, and sell on his <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>eck and kissed him.</HI> And all the <HI>An∣swer</HI> to his hun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>le Confession and Pe∣tition is the <HI>Fathers</HI> saying to the Servants, <HI>Bring forth the best Robe and put it on him, and put a Ring on his hand; And bring hither the fatted C<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>, and kill it, and let us eat and be merry.</HI> So the tender fatherly Compassions of God are also represented upon the Repentance of sinning <HI>Ephraim:</HI> Jer. 31.20. <HI>Is he a dear Son? is he a plea∣sant Child?</HI></P>
<P>UPON all then we see the <HI>Harmony</HI> of the Doctrines and Laws of Christ, with the Original and lapsed State of Man. Man was at first a <HI>holy Off∣spring,</HI> now he is a <HI>sinning</HI> one; and our Holy <HI>Saviour</HI> brings him by <HI>Re∣pentance</HI> back to his Father, into his Heart and Arms again. The <HI>Sin</HI> of Man is the Sin of a <HI>Son</HI> against his Father; the <HI>Repentance</HI> which the
<PB N="150" REF="003010_0077_0FEF960D4B65B980"/>Gospel requires is <HI>a-filial</HI> Mourning and Return to God Renewing Grace restores us to our Original Dignity and makes us again meet to be called the <HI>Offspring</HI> of God. — But I come to a <HI>seventh Inference.</HI></P>
