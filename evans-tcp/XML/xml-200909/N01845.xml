<HEAD>A <HI>Vindication,</HI> &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHEREAS there hath late∣ly been published in <HI>Boston</HI> a Pamphlet, Entituled, <HI>An Account of the Reasons why a considerable Number of the New North Congregation in</HI> Boston, <HI>could not consent to Mr.</HI> Peter Thacher's <HI>Ordination there,</HI> &amp;c. In which Pamphlet are con∣tained several plain and, positive Falshoods, as to Matters of Fact therein related, and many Misre∣presentations of the proceedings of the said Church, in their bringing forward the choice of a Pastor to joyn with the Reverend Mr. <HI>Webb,</HI> in the work of the Ministry, and in their Electing the Reverend Mr. <HI>Peter Thacher</HI> to be their Pastor, and settling him in said Office. The Falshoods and Misrepresentations hereby spread concerning the Weighty and important Managements of said
<PB N="2" REF="002186_0003_10030CDE0D9422A0"/>Church, loudly calls upon us to make our D<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣fence against those who make it evident to the World, that they are endeavouring to hurt us in our best and most valuable interests.</P>
<P>In order to our Vindication, we shall recite some of the most material passages mentioned in the said Pamphlet, relating to our Conduct, and set those proceedings of ours in a true Light.</P>
<P>First then, We find them asserting, That a Number of the Members of our Church did use underhand practices to Rob <HI>Weymouth,</HI> and Im∣pose a Minister on <HI>Boston;</HI> which thing has been much talked of, and we thought we had done enough to prevent its being improved against us any more; for at a Church Meeting, where most of the dissatisfyed Brethren were present, that mat∣ter was throughly debated, and every one that could be in the least suspected, declared they never were concerned, directly nor indirectly, by writing, or by any other means whatsoever, to invite Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI> to leave <HI>Weymouth</HI> and come to us. After these things were fairly and fully debated, it was proposed by our Reverend Pastor, that if we were in Charity with each other on that account, we should express it by lifting up our hands, which we concluded every one did; and we challenge any person in the world to prove, that ever any of the Members of our Church have been guilty of what they have charged them with in this Affair.</P>
<P>As to what they alledge of their being fallaci∣ously dealt with (<HI>page</HI> 5, 6.) and being cut off from the benefit of a Vore we passed the <HI>13th</HI> of
<PB N="3" REF="002186_0003_10030CDE0D9422A0"/><HI>May</HI> in favour of the Congregation; we say, that this one thing set in a due light, we can't but think silenceth one great clamour of our Oppo∣sers, <HI>viz.</HI> Oppression; for this Vote was proposed and come into purely in indulgence to them, and to make them sensible we would do our utmost we could to quiet them and make them easy.</P>
<P>As to their being cut off from the Liberty gi∣ven them in that Vote by an Obligation, which they say was tacked to it; We reply, that the obli∣gation so much complained of is plainly implyed in the Vote, for that is founded on the Liberty given by the Province Law to the Congregations in the Country; and the reason why the Vote was not fully compleated at this Meeting was, we could not determine the Bounds of the Congrega∣tion, and therefore deferred it till we had consult∣ed with some of the chief of the Congregation; and then it was determined that all the constant Hearers and Contributers should be allowed the priviledge of a Vote, that would come under such an Obligation, which was no more than only a promise, That they would do their part towards the Support of the Ministry, so long as God in his Providence continued them in that place, which was signed by a considerable Number who did actually Vote in the Choice, and it was un∣reasonable and groundless Jealousies that hindered the dissatisfy'd from coming into it.</P>
<P>As to a pretended promise made by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Webb,</HI> that they should see Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI>'s Dismission, signed by the major part of the Church of <HI>Weymouth</HI> before we proceeded further; and that it was promised some of the Church should go to <HI>Weymouth</HI> and bring it; We reply, that we
<PB N="4" REF="002186_0004_10030CE155AAC4A8"/>remember it was moved by them, but Mr. <HI>Webb</HI> an∣swer'd to their proposal, that it was not reasona∣ble nor practicable according to Custom in such cases, but that they should see a Dismission in usual Form, and such a Dismission we according∣ly produced and offered, at the time when they were called to concur with the Church in the Choice.</P>
<P>Again, we find asserted, (<HI>page</HI> 12.) That we chose Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI> to be our Minister when he was the Minister of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> which we declare to be a positive Falshood; and can prove, that Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI> had his Dismission from his Pastoral Relation to the Church of <HI>Weymonth</HI> by a Vote of that Church the 23d of <HI>February,</HI> 1718, 19, and that another Pastor, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Thomas Pain,</HI> was chosen both by Church and Town, and had actu∣ally taken Charge of the Pulpit before Mr <HI>Thacher</HI> left them, and was ordained in his room before we made choice of him to be our Pastor which was on the <HI>9th</HI> of <HI>September,</HI> 1719. And now the Church of <HI>Weymouth</HI> being settled undersano∣ther Pastor, they dismist Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI> at his de∣sire, as a Member, and gave him a Letter of Recommendation, wherein they say, <HI>That his Con∣versation with them had been as becometh the Gospel, and that they parted with him in perfect Charity;</HI> for which there was a full Vote in the Church, and not one Person objected against it, as some of us were assur'd by the present Reverend Pastor of that Church; tho' we find it asserted (<HI>page</HI> 36.) they can prove it was a lean Vote, and objections made against the Recommendation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="002186_0004_10030CE155AAC4A8"/>
Again, We find them by way of <HI>Query (page</HI> 28.) asking, <HI>Whether Mr.</HI> Thacher <HI>did not send a Letter, and charge the Church not to consent to a Council, or desire some Friend to do it for him, for such a Letter there was, and it had its Influence.</HI> This we declare to be a positive Fashood; for our Church as a Body, nor any single Member of it, as we know of, ever received any such Letter from Mr. <HI>Thacher,</HI> or any other person in the World; nor ever had the least hint there was such a Letter, 'till we found it asserted in the Pamplet.</P>
<P>There are many more Notorious Falshoods in the forenamed Pamphlet, which we think it not needful for us to answer, since we know not the Author; and those Particulars which we have already answer'd are the foundation of the Contro∣versy; and we have no prospect of its being ended, tho' we should answer every Particular.</P>
<P>And we hope no serious Christian will justify that Pamphlet, which appears to be written with so much Heat and Anger; for it's evident, that the force and strength of its Rage is levelled at our Ministers; and what can the design of this be, but to render their Labours unsuccessful, and pre∣judice People against them? If this be their de∣sign, and they should in the least obtain their end, certainly without deep Repentance and Sorrow for such Sins, dreadful must be the Account which such persons will have to give up another Day. Our Ministers are very dear to us, and some of us can very truly, and we hope very feelingly say that we have cause to bless God for them; and we trust there are great Numbers in the Town that have a great affection for them, for the re∣markable
<PB N="6" REF="002186_0005_10030CE326253E58"/>Meekness and Moderation they have shewn in this more than ordinary Difficulty and Tryal they have met withal.</P>
<P>And whereas we find them charged with an un∣becoming Te<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>per and Carriage in the forecited Pamphlet, in which they very particularly bid the Readers to enquire with what a Temper Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI> acted upon his admission into the Church, to whom (if any should enquire) we should be glad of the opportunity to relate; Namely, That it was with great Meekness he addressed himself to the Church at that time; and his Expressions were so Christian, and in so moving a manner, as affected the greater part (we believe all, except those few who opposed him) and they being the persons to whom he chiefly apply'd, it was very surprising to all the the rest, that they were no more affected with it.</P>
<P>They charge the Reverend Mr. <HI>Webb</HI> with parti∣ality in our Meetings in reproving Sharply those who were not of his mind, and not reproving those who were, when they spake unbecomingly; we can truly say, we Never once observed it to be so; but always to the contrary, Exhorting us all to a Christian Temper one towards another; and when he saw any thing otherwise with a great deal of meekness and moderation Administred a reproof to one as well as to another; and in all the manage∣ments of our affairs carryed it with the same tem∣per to the dissatisfyed as he did at the Meeting-House when the Reverend Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI> was Instal∣led; and what his behaviour towards them was at that time and their carriage towards him, we
<PB N="7" REF="002186_0005_10030CE326253E58"/>leave to the many hundreds then present to judge. And both our Pastors have always prest it upon us to study the things that make for peace, and to overlook whatever Ill treatment we met with from those who dissented from us; and we hope we have endeavoured to observe those directions, and still are inclined so to do; and can truly say, it is and always hath been a great grie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to us, to have such a difference with any of our Bre∣thren, and are willing to do any thing that lies i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our power to come to an agreement with them and to live in love and peace as becomes Brethren.</P>
<P>Who were the Authors of said Pamphlet wekno<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> not, but find the names of several of our Brethre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of the Church inserted in it, whether nhey ga<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their consent that it should be so, we know no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> but since it is so, and we find in the Preface a Cha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> lenge to answer any objection against it, either b<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> fore the Civil Authority or a Council of Churche<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we do now in the most open and Publick mann<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Declare, that we are freely willing to submit a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our differences with our said Brethren to a Coun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Churches as we publickly voted on the day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Reverend Mr. <HI>Thacher</HI>'s Instalment; when bo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> our Pastors and the whole Church openly expre<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their readiness to submit whatever concern'd eith<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of them in the management of their late Importa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> affair to the hearing of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ouncil, &amp; as the next day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> offered 'em when Mr. <HI>Webb</HI> sent for all the dissatis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Brethren of the Church to give him a Meeting at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> House to consult about the calling a Council, se∣ral of them then refused to come, &amp; those who d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> refused to joyn Issue with us.

<PB N="8" REF="002186_0006_10030288DB6F1DF8"/>except One which we were desired to call at a Juncture when the Church verily concluded (all things consider'd) could have no tendency to esta∣blish Peace among us, nor in the Town, and if we were out in our Judgment about it we earnestly <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>esire to be made sensible of our Error in it, and to make Christian Satisfaction for it. But always before and ever since have been ready to leave our whole controversy to the examination of a Council of Churches according to our Constitution, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd do now heartily consent to joy<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> issue with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ur Dissatisfyed Brethren in that way, excluding <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hose Churches who have been concerned in any <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f our late managements and those Persons who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave prejudged the cause. And upon the first no∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ice we have from our Brethren of their Inclinati∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n to joyn with us in calling such a Council we <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>all heartily embrace it, and rejoyce at the very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pearance of such a prospect of putting an end to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r unhappy controversy in this Christian way.</P>
<P>And having openly and freely declared our selves, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e hope it will be a sufficient Vindication and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>fence against all the unjust Charges made against <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> in said Pamphlet; tho' we have not given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>either shall we pretend to give) a particular <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>swer to each one of them in this way; much <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s shall we Recriminate upon our Brethren, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>blish to the World in the way and manner they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ve done, what the just grounds of our Grievan∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> at them are; for so to do we judge wou'd but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ry the unhappy Controversy farther, and excite <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d confirm greater Prejudices in each against o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er; and we suppose it is own'd by all men of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>servation and tho't, that such a way of mana∣ging

<P>WHeras there is a an Attempt to prove me guilty of promise breaking and falshood, as to my staying and Administring Special Ordinan∣ces at <HI>Weymouth</HI> till they had another Minister Ordained. I solemnly declare I have with the greatest exactness and most impartial care recol∣lected my own words and managements on that Head, and can't find that I made such a Promise, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd therefore the charge upon me in that Regard must needs arise (to speak with the utmost guard) from mistake if not worse. This will appear to Presons at leisure to be informed, by the Tenour of the Vote of Dismission, and some glances at Fact, the vote of Dismission ran thus, That I had their Consent to remove whensoever I saw it con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enient and proper. This joyned with some facts <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust set me fair in this Matter in the Conscien∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>es of all judicious and charitable Christians. The reason why the Vote of Dismission ran in the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entioned Tenour was this; One of the principal Men of the Church, Deacon <HI>Edward Bates,</HI> in Con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sation with me before the Church Meeting, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>id, their desire was, that I would assist them <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the settleing another Minister, and that if the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ote was not worded accordingly, I should have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o Power after the Vote to administer special <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rdinances, while I stayed to help them in that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffair; whereupon I Worded the Vote so as to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e looked upon as their Pastor, but upon my Re∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ove ceased to be so.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="002186_0007_10030CEA55DDFDF0"/>
Before this Vote was passed, I explained my self to the Church, and told them, it was my de∣fire to see them in a good way of Settlement before I left them, and therefore proposed to stay with them some time, if they concurred to it, to assist them in that great Work; and that I worded the Vote as I did, that while I did stay I might <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e able without any ones Objection to administer special Ordinances: Upon this Explication they concurred, with a Dissent but of Three Men; and I did stay according to my own desire, till the Church had chose Mr. <HI>Pain,</HI> and the Congregati∣on had concurred to that Choice: But not on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> word as I remember passed about Ordination and my staying till then,</P>
<P>Two Circumstances more I call to mind ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> particularly: That the Committee to invite M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Pain,</HI> after they had done treating with him di<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by one of them, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>John Torrey,</HI> desire m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to preach with them one Sabbath and the a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦proaching Fast, because by that time their Mini∣ster would return; which I promised and pe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦formed. I won't suspect the Readers Understand∣ing so much as to argue upon it, <HI>That this plai<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>¦ly signifyed, they did not look upon me under su<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an Engagement.</HI></P>
<P>And to conclude, just before my actual Remo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> several of the principal Men came and took lea<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> with all proper Love and Respect to me, and dont remember that any of them signified to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that they so much as looked upon me Obliged <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> promise either to stay or return to administer s<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>∣cial Ordinances.

Having thus Declared my self I hope the persons who have been drawn in to testify against me will Solemnly consider the Charge made, as they will Answer it to their Great Judge another Day, and do Justice to my reputation, and not ruin their own Souls to destroy my Character and Ministry. And I would promise my self that the Church, whose Souls and welfare have always been, and now are very dear to me; who have so often declared my faithfulness while among them, and their great <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffection, will not suffer me to be oppress'd in so open <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nd approbrious a Manner for want of testifying to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he truth of this Declaration, as obliged by the clea∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>est and strongest bond of Justice and Charity.</P>

<P>WHereas in a Pamphlet lately Printed and spread abroad, I am charged with down∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght Breach of Promise to <HI>Mr. Lee,</HI> and several o∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ers that were with him at my House, on the Day <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pointed for the <HI>Instalment</HI> of the Reverend Mr. <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>acher</HI> in the <HI>New North Church,</HI> and am desired by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>me of my Brethren to give them a brief and plain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>lation of this Fact. In compliance with their fire I do it: And to the best of my remembrance, is as follows.</P>
<P>On the Day aforesaid about 5 or 6 of our ag∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eved Brethren, some of the Church, the Rest of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Congregation were at my House, and as they <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ate, desired a hearing of their Case by the Reve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Elders and Messengers before they should pro∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eed to the Publick work and Business of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y. Their Request being granted, they read seve∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Papers</HI> to the Ministers and Messengers, and, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke to them as is affirmed in said Pamphlet;
<PB N="13" REF="002186_0008_1003028F249A7BC0"/>Upon this the Reverend <HI>Moderator</HI> desired the Pa∣pers might be delivered and lodged with him as was usual in such Cases, and after some short de∣bate were deliver'd, and (as I understood) accor∣ding to the <HI>Moderator</HI>'s desire, without any Pro∣mise from him in the least that they should ever be returned. And before our Brethren went out of the Room, they desired of the Ministers and Mes∣sengers present, that their Papers might be further considered by them and they themselves called for again, adding (as they say) that they had Wit∣nesses from <HI>Weymouth</HI> to attest to the Things rela∣ting to Mr. <HI>Thacher.</HI> To this the Reverend Mi∣nisters (if I remember aright) replyed, the one and the other of them to this effect, <HI>That they should Consider what had been offered unto them, and act according to the best of their Judgment upon it:</HI> And farther made this <HI>Conditional</HI> Promise to our Brethren, viz. <HI>If they found upon Consideration any Occasion for them to speak further to, or explain what they had offered, they would send for them</HI> And I suppose there is at least 3 Persons that ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ready (if there should be occasion for it) to <HI>Attes<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> to the Truth of what is thus far related. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> now as to what more immediately concerns m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>self, The Case is this; When the Reverend Gern¦tlemen aforesaid had made the abovementione<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Conditional</HI> Promise to my Brethren, I being bette<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> acquainted in the Neighbourhood than any in th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Council were, I enquired of my Brethren whe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> they would be, that I might send my Lad for the in case the Council should see any necessity for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and desire me so to do. The answer return'd <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me was, We shall be at Mr. <HI>Lee</HI>'s house. And make no question but the 3 Persons I referred to a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> are able to testify to the Truth of this also. Up<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="14" REF="002186_0009_10030CED78A9C878"/>this o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Brethren took their leave of us, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> went to the door with them, and as they were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>¦ing away Mr. <HI>Lee</HI> desired me to send my Boy f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> them; agreeable (as I apprehended) to what <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> had said before unto them in the House, <HI>i. e.</HI> i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> case the Reverend Elders and Messengers should desire me so to do. And with this Apprehension I re∣turned the Answer, Yes, unto him: and so we parted.</P>
<P>This, to the best of my Remembrance, is a true Account of all that passed with relation to the <HI>Ministers,</HI> and <HI>my</HI> Promise to the aggrieved Brethren, which we have so often been charged with the breach of. And as the Charge in the printed <HI>Pamphlet</HI> seems more especially to be levelled against me, I have this further to offer in my own vindication, <HI>viz.</HI> Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> very <HI>Nature</HI> of the thing, is the clearest and strongest Testimony in my Favour, were there no other <HI>Evidence,</HI> (as I make no doubt there is plenti∣ful) in the Case; for I was no more of the Coun∣cil, nor had any more to do than my aggrieved Brethren themselves had, to send for any Persons <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o come to them, unless the Council desired it of me, and there is no doubt to be made, but that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>he Reverend Ministers belonging unto it, have such an entire Regard to Truth, that if they had apprehended themselves in the least measure under <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y obligation by <HI>Promise</HI> to send for our aggrieved Breth∣ren after they had once dismissed them, they would have fulfilled the engagement, and have desired me to send for them. And I solemnly declare, if I had had the least hint from the Reverend Ministers so to do, or the least appre∣hension that the said Brethren absolutely expected I should have sent unto them, with or without any direction from <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Council, I should certainly have done so.</P>
