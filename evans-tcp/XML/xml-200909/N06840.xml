<P>O SING unto the Lord a new song, for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory.</P>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HOEVER has been much conversant in the holy scriptures, has, I suppose, made the two following observations. The first, That the prophetic writers, after speaking of some recent, common events, and things of a secular nature, often slide, al∣most imperceptibly, into futurity; or into the mention of those things that pertain to the kingdom of God under the reign of the Messiah. So that while a per∣son thinks he is reading only about certain ordinary occurrents, and expects to meet with nothing else, he finds himself suddenly carried into future times with
<PB N="6" REF="008668_0004_102FB1F18848E538"/>
the prophet; even into the later periods of the chris∣tian dispensation, concerning which the most glorious things are foretold.</P>
<P>THE other observation alluded to above, is, That in the prophetic writings, what is spoken primarily concerning worldly things and events then present, past, or speedily to come to pass, has often a reference to other matters; to things spiritual and future; and not only future, but far distant; and indeed princi∣pally respects these: viz. the person, offices, and reign of Christ; and the glory of his kindgdom in the latter days. So that in one view, the same pas∣sage is sometimes common history, and in another view, illustrious prophecy; some word or clause being purposely inserted, which determines the passage to be of the prophetical kind; and chiefly to relate to the kingdom of Christ, even while a great, or perhaps the greater part of it, has a plain reference to other matters, more common and familiar.</P>
<P>MANY of the psalms <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">As for instance, the 2nd, 72nd and 89th psalms. The pas∣sages of scripture which have such a double meaning, are indeed numerous, both in the old and new testament. And they partake of the nature of parables, or allegories; which are sometimes literally true, either in part or whole: But what is chiefly intended in them, is the <HI>moral,</HI> or spiri∣tual meaning couched under those common words &amp; phras∣es. And, what this secondary, yet principal, and ultimate sense is, may generally at least, if not always, be determined with great ease and certainty by the discerning and judici∣ous. Tho' it must not be denied, that some whimsical, but well meaning people, have made very odd work with such passages, by over straining them; and have sometimes con∣ceited a double meaning without any apparent reason for it: whereby they have given too much occasion to others to ri∣dicule the whole notion of types, and a double sense, as tho' it were in itself absurd.</NOTE> of David are plain exam∣ples, and undeniable proofs, of both these observati∣ons.
<PB N="7" REF="008668_0005_102FB23AB1CAD380"/>
And the 98th psalm, the beginning of which I have chosen for the ground of my discourses on the present joyful occasion, is an example of the latter of them.</P>
<P>IN this psalm David praises God, and exhorts others to praise him, on account of some signal appearances of his providence in favour of his chosen people; in saving them from, and giving them victory over their enemies; hereby openly shewing his righteousness to the heathen nations around them. This is doubtless the primary design of the psalm; at least, of the for∣mer part of it: But it is not the principal, or ultimate. In its chief and ultimate view, it is a prophecy of what was to come to pass in the days of the Messiah; when God was, by him, to make known his salvation in a far higher, and more illustrious sense; and to reveal his righteousness, not only to the heathen na∣tions in, and round about the land of Canaan, but to the uttermost parts of the earth. So it is said, ver. 3d, in the time <HI>past</HI> (as is common in the language of pro∣phecy, to denote the immutable certainty of the thing spoken of)
<Q>He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel: ALL THE ENDS OF THE EARTH <HI>have</HI> seen the salvation of our God.</Q>
In consequence whereof, not only Israel, but all the earth, is called upon in the following ver∣ses, to make a joyful noise unto the Lord, to rejoice and sing his praises. Yea, the sea, and the fulness thereof, are bid to join in this concert; the world, and they that dwell therein, while
<Q>the floods clap their hands, and the hills are joyful together.</Q></P>
<P>THIS is both extremely sublime, and very natural; since the main subject of the psalm, is that glorious reign of Christ, before the conclusion of which there
<PB N="8" REF="008668_0006_102FB1F44081E200"/>
is to be a general "restitution", or renovation of all things; even of the material earth and heavens. For behold, saith the Lord, I make all things new: And we, according to his promise, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. And indeed this psalm itself, tho' a short one, looks for∣ward to the time of our Lord's second coming;
<Q>whom the heavens must receive, [only] until these times of restitution of all things, which God hath spoken of by the mouth of all his holy prophets, since the world began.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts III. 21.</NOTE></Q> For it is to be observed, that all things rational and irrational, animate and inanimate, are called upon thus to rejoice together,
<Q>BEFORE THE LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: With righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with equity;</Q>
as the psalm con∣cludes.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the text:
<Q>O sing unto the Lord a new song, for he hath done marvellous things: his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory. The Lord hath made known his sal∣vation: his righteousness hath he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.</Q>
This passage, as before observed, has undoubtedly a reference to some very remarkable deliverance which God had vouchsafed to his people Israel, and to his subduing their enemies under them; hereby making manifest his righteous∣ness to their heathen neighbours. In consequence whereof, the Israelites are admonished to sing
<Q>a new song;</Q>
which was not used to be done, but upon some very signal occasion. But while the passage has such a retrospect to things and events already past, it does, without all reasonable doubt, look forward to things and events then, and even still future. And this new song, considered in the ultimate view of the passage, may probably be no other than that menti∣oned in the revelation of St. John.</P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="008668_0007_102FB23DE68A93C0"/>THE present occasion, you are sensible, leads us directly and immediately to consider this passage, only as an exhortation to praise God for the temporal sal∣vation, the successes and victories, with which at any time he favours his people: but especially when these are very signal and illustrious; so that by them, God may be said to make known his salvation, and openly to shew his righteousness in the sight of the heathen. Which is strictly and literally applicable to what he hath lately done for us, at least here in America. But having considered and applied the passage in this view of it, I am persuaded, you will think it proper for us then to extend our views beyond these temporal con∣cernments; and briefly to consider what aspect our military successes have upon the kingdom of Christ, the extension thereof, and its establishment in its pow∣er and purity thro'out the earth. For this is not only that event, to which the passage ultimately relates; but it is what we all do, or should, firmly believe and pray for, whenever we repeat those words—
<Q>Thy kingdom come; thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven!</Q>
And our late victories and successes may, not improbably, contribute to the accomplish∣ment of this great event.</P>
<P>BUT before I come to speak particularly of these successes, which have lately attended the arms of our king; and of our obligation to sing a new song on ac∣count of them; it will be proper to observe and il∣lustrate one most important point of doctrine contained in the text; and which is really the foundation of all the gratitude and praise, which we owe to almighty God for them. It is this; That God is truly the author of all our deliverances from, successes against, and victories over, our worldly enemies. You see that these are in the text ascribed to God; there
<PB N="10" REF="008668_0008_102FB1FA15A1CBC8"/>
being no particular mention made, so much as of any means or instruments, employed by him in bringing them to pass. Altho' means and instruments are at least generally, if not always supposed, in such cases; yet the psalmist here takes no particular notice of any, but attributes all directly to God. The Lord hath done marvellous things, says he; his right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory. He is ac∣cordingly said to have made known <HI>his</HI> salvation hereby; and to have openly shewed his righteous∣ness to the heathen: Tho' possibly there might have been nothing of a miraculous kind, strictly speaking, in the deliverance and successes wherewith God had favoured his people, and which are here primarily in∣tended. At least this is supposeable; for the same kind of language is often used in scripture, respecting those successes and victories, which were confessedly brought about only by natural, ordinary and human means; which is sufficient to my present design. And so much it was needful to observe, previously to my entering upon it. For, intirely setting aside the case of miraculous interpositions, with which we our selves are not now concerned; it is proposed, by divine assistance, to illustrate and confirm the proposition mentioned above, on the supposition that things come to pass according to what is called the established course of nature, and the settled order of things. For even upon this supposition, as well as in those cases where miracles are to be admitted▪ all our temporal deliverances, victories and successes are from almighty God:—Otherwise indeed, I know not what reason we have to praise him for them, however great or important they are in themselves. And this is cer∣tainly a point, very suitable to employ our thoughts at this season, and upon the present occasion.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="008668_0009_102FB23F6F1ED208"/>HOWEVER, you will observe that it is not so much the proof, strictly speaking, as the illustration of this point, that is now intended: Because it is taken for granted, that we all in general believe this to be true already; and therefore do not need to have it proved to us in a formal manner. But yet it may be profi∣table to many, and indeed to all of us, to hear some reflections and remarks upon it, by way of illustration.</P>
<P>SOME general notion of a providence superintend∣ing the world, and the concerns of mankind, has been common in all parts and ages of the world; and also common to all persons, with a very few exceptions. The ancient epicureans, indeed, denied a providence, while they professed to believe there were Gods in great number; so many, that it were easier to call all the stars by their names, than to give a catalogue of them. But perhaps they acknowledged a deity, or deities, only to avoid the general odium of mankind, being nothing better than atheists in disguise; if in∣deed there be any such thing as speculative, or philo∣sophical atheism. But at this day all professed theists, to be sure all christians, believe a providence; how∣ever crude, indigested, and partial, the conceptions of many persons may be concerning it. None of these imagine, as the epicureans affected to do, that God is too indolent, or that he disdaineth, to concern him∣self about the things that are done on earth, even tho' he humbleth himself when he beholdeth them that are done in heaven; in those heavens, which are not clean in his sight, and the angels whereof he chargeth with folly.</P>
<P>NOW, if there be any such thing as a providence, conversant and active about men, and their temporal concernments, which is taken for granted; certainly
<PB N="12" REF="008668_0010_102FB1FB9EF29798"/>
national wars and their events, must be under God's particular inspection and superintendence; these be∣ing, in their nature, of the highest importance, and the consequences of them most extensive and interest∣ing. It is on the conduct, success and issue of battles and wars, that the temporal welfare of nations princi∣pally depends, from generation to generation. And not only their temporal, but their spiritual welfare also, depends in a great measure upon the management and issue of wars. For hereby it is frequently determin∣ed, in effect, not only whether people shall enjoy their native country, their laws, their civil rights and liberties; but also whether they shall lose or enjoy their religion, with their spiritual privileges; and whe∣ther their posterity shall be of this or that religion, or perhaps of none at all.</P>
<P>WHOEVER is conversant in history, or is tolerably acquainted with the past and present state of the world, knows that the religious state of countries is often determined, almost unavoidably, to be what it is in general, by wars and conquests; almost as certain∣ly as their political and civil state. How often does the conqueror deprive the conquered of their old re∣ligion, either in whole or in part; and give them a new one in its room? Which is done, either by right down tyrannical imposition, or else by allowing some peculiar privileges of a secular nature to those who will make an exchange; which latter, though it be a gentler and more humane way of bringing about a revolution in religion, and may require more time, is not perhaps a less efficacious and certain one in the end. Sometimes both these methods are employed at once. And what is it, for example, that hath made almost all the <HI>East,</HI> mahometans? those who, at least whose fore-fathers, were once christians? What is it that hath
<PB N="13" REF="008668_0011_102FB2455A3AC478"/>
produc'd so prodigious an alteration in the religious state of those countries, in so considerable a part of Europe, Asia and Africa? The visible, apparent cau∣ses hereof, were the wars and conquests of the Sara∣cens; of Mahomet and his successors, and the vari∣ous methods used by them to suppress the religion of Christ, and to propagate the imposture of the Coran.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Or mahometan bible.</NOTE> This is only mentioned as one remarkable example of what is usually the effect of conquests in a greater or less degree. It cannot, however, be denied, that the changes thus introduced in religion, are sometimes for the better, as well as often for the worse. As, for instance, since the time of Oliver Cromwell, at least of William III, the roman catholic religion has, I suppose, been gradually losing, and the protestant gaining ground, in Ireland: And this, without perse∣cution, inquisitions and racks; which are abhorrent from the principles of the latter, tho' very consonant to the spirit and temper of too many of its professors. Now, if this be indeed God's world, and in any pro∣per sense under his inspection and government, it is impossible but that he must, in some way or other, order and determine these great events of war, by which almost all other things are, in effect, determin∣ed; both in the religious and civil state of nations. If we should suppose that success and victory are not owing to the influence and operation, or the provi∣dential government of God, we should take a great and most material part of his work out of his hands; leav∣ing him, I had almost said, but very little to do in the administration of this world. On this supposition, the world would be govern'd almost without him; even with respect to the greatest, and most interesting events and revolutions, that come to pass therein from age to age! And if we could once suppose, that God does
<PB N="14" REF="008668_0012_102FB1FD347A76A8"/>
not concern himself about these matters, the wars of nations, their conduct, and various issues; if we could once imagine, that some mighty empires are reduced, overturned and ruined, while other kingdoms are founded, extended, and made formidable, indepen∣dently of God, or without his providential influence and ordination; we might then come into this farther conclusion, naturally, if not necessarily flowing from such premises, viz. That all other events in this world also come to pass independently of God; they being apparently of less consequence to the world than these. But as this would be directly to adopt the old epicurean system, which was really no better than disguised atheism, it is concluded, nothing needs to be said in confutation of it in a christian assembly.</P>
<P>BUT, from these general reflections on the over∣ruling providence of God in the success and issue of wars, we will, if you please, proceed now to take a nearer and more particular view of these important events. We will consider, what are the usual, the vi∣sible, and more immediate causes of military successes and victories: In doing which, we shall trace the ves∣tiges of divine providence. We shall hereby see some∣thing of the manner, in which God operates to the production of these effects in ordinary cases, by the instrumentality of secondary causes, or natural means: Which, it is hoped, will be a useful entertainment to us, and particularly seasonable at this time.</P>
<P>WHEN nations are engaged in war, there are divers things, to which success is apparently, and more visibly owing, whenever obtain'd; sometimes to one of them, sometimes to another; and sometimes to a coincidence of several together. And a cursory review, or brief consideration of these things, will serve to illustrate
<PB N="15" REF="008668_0013_102FB246E1DA4668"/>
and confirm the main point before us; by shewing, that there is no victory, no success in war, but what is ultimately to be resolved into the holy will, the active influence, or providential government of God.</P>
<P N="1">1. TO begin then at the visible source and foun∣tain of military enterprises and operations: Success is sometimes more plainly owing to a superiority of wis∣dom in the cabinet, in a king, or his council and mi∣nistry, than to any other secondary cause. For when there is an equality of advantage in all other respects, such a superiority of wisdom at the helm, at least or∣dinarily determines the success. It is in courts, that the scheme and plan of wars, and the general manner of conducting them, are laid and fixed upon. And one nation often becomes victorious and triumphant, rather than its enemy, because there is more wisdom and prudence at the helm, in directing and pointing its military efforts. But from whom, or from whence, did some kings, their councils or ministers, derive this superiority of wisdom and genius? How, for exam∣ple, does it come to pass, that a GEORGE and a PITT have more wisdom than a <HI>Louis</HI> and a <HI>Belleisle?</HI> Is their wisdom self-derived? or have they more than they received from above? You know, who it is that teacheth man knowledge; whose inspiration giveth him understanding; and from whence all sound judg∣ment and counsel comes. It is all originally from God, as truly as the wisdom of prophets and apostles; tho' not of the same kind, nor designed to answer ex∣actly the same ends. So that whenever success and and triumph are more visibly owing to such a superio∣rity of wisdom at the helm, than to any other cause, you see to whom the glory thereof is ultimately due.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="16" REF="008668_0014_102FB1FEBB0CE5C8"/>2. SUCCESS is often owing to a superiority of mili∣tary skill, courage and stratagem, in the general or generals, who have the more immediate direction and conduct of a war committed to them. All other circum∣stances being supposed alike, such a difference between the capacities of the respective commanders of armies, commonly at least determines the victory. Many a general and admiral have lost the day, merely by being outwitted; and as many, of consequence, have come off with success and applause, by means of their superior skill and address. But is not the wisdom and penetration of generals, or military commanders, de∣rived from the same divine source, with that of kings, their ministers and counsellors? Does not God make a difference in this respect between the former, as well as between the latter? Did not the DUKE of MARL∣BOROUGH, for example, receive that military genius from heaven, which gave him such a superiority over the French commanders, the beginning of this century? Who made a FERDINAND superior to <HI>Rich∣lieu</HI> and a <HI>Contade?</HI> perhaps to a <HI>Broglio</HI> also? And who but God was the author of those military ac∣complishments, that penetration, address, and true martial ardor, which appeared in the late general WOLFE; and which have render'd both HIM, and the HEIGHTS OF ABRAHAM, forever memorable? Or who gave ANOTHER general, whom I need not name, the wisdom and magnanimity to conduct the war in this part of America, to a conclusion at once so glori∣ous to himself, so happy for us, and for Great-Britain?—But without a regard to any particular times or facts, it is unquestionably true in general, that superior sagacity, a thorough knowledge of mili∣tary affairs, bravery, and a right judgment in a chief commander, are of the utmost importance; and that success is often more visibly owing hereto, than to
<PB N="17" REF="008668_0015_102FB24867709E60"/>
any other cause. And if we know from whom those qualities are derived, we can be at no loss, to whom the successes obtained by means of them are to be as∣cribed. Certainly God did not originally make all generals &amp; military commanders equal; or give them the same capacity and genius for war: We have seen a very remarkable difference even amongst our own, during the present war.—</P>
<P N="3">3. SUCCESS and victory are sometimes most appa∣rently owing to a superiority on one side in respect of numbers. And indeed, when there is equal wisdom in the cabinet, equal skill, discipline and bravery in the field, and all other circumstances are alike favourable to both sides; whenever this is the case, it is plain that, without a miracle, victory must declare for the most numerous host. And numbers have often prevailed against a superiority in almost all other respects; tho' not so often as other things have pre∣vailed against numbers. But since this is sometimes the case, let us consider whence it is, that one nation or country is more populous than another; and able to send more troops into the field. Do men grow spontaneously out of the ground, like trees? or ra∣ther, as they do not? For it is God's hand that plants and waters, and his sun that warms, even the meaner shrubs, as well as the spreading oak, the hanging elm, and the cedars of Lebanon, those tall and ancient sons of the forest. Now does God cause the trees, and even the lowly shrubs, to abound more in one country than another; and do men, who are stiled "his offspring," increase and multiply with him! Surely they do not. God has not only made all nations to dwell upon the face of the earth; but has determined the times before appointed, in which they live, whether in succession or at once; and has even fixed the bounds of their habi∣tation
<PB N="18" REF="008668_0016_102F7510DCC1B990"/>
respectively <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Acts XVII. 26.</NOTE>. If, while one nation is increased and enlarged, another is diminished by plagues, earth∣quakes, famine, or any other means, doubtless it is the providence of God that makes this difference. It is therefore evident, that when one nation is suc∣cessful in carrying on a war, by reason of its being greater and more populous than another, such success is ultimately to be attributed to God, who multiplieth one, and diminisheth another by various methods, as he pleaseth.</P>
<P N="4">4. SUCCESS and victory are sometimes more appa∣rently owing to neither of these things, but to the superior courage and strength, patience and resolution of the troops; I mean, of the common soldiery. These qualities often prevail over superior numbers, and many other advantages, to such a degree almost, that one has been known to chase an hundred; and two, to put ten thousand to flight: As in some of the wars of the Jews of old; and in others also, where nothing praeternatural is supposed to have taken place; parti∣cularly in the wars between the ancient Greeks and the Persians: Wherein a few thousands, or even hun∣dreds of the former, sometimes put to the rout almost incredible hosts of the latter; armies, the number of which, as is said of Gog and Magog,
<Q>was as the sand of the sea;</Q> and which <Q>went up on the breadth of the earth</Q>
<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. XX.</NOTE> against them. But whence is it that some men, yea whole nations in general, have more bodily strength, and more fortitude than others? Some are doubtless weaker, more timed and faint-hearted than others, even by nature. Or if this ap∣parent difference amongst men, be in part owing to a difference in the climates, who made this difference? Or if it be owing partly to different ways of living,
<PB N="19" REF="008668_0017_102FB24FD3A21F80"/>
different discipline, &amp;c; yet the providence of God is not to be excluded, even here. There is indeed no reason to doubt but that courage, and even bo∣dily strength, may be acquir'd and improved by pro∣per methods of living, exercise and discipline. But this is never actually done independently of divine providence, giving opportunity and occasion for it, and leading the way to such improvement. There is of∣ten a co-incidence of many things and events, and a long train of particular circumstances, by means whereof the courage and martial prowess of one na∣tion are raised and improved to a prodigious height; while in another nation there is no such train of cir∣cumstances, no such co-incidence of things and events, favourable to a martial spirit: But, on the contrary, such an one as tends to enfeeble and enervate, to dis∣pirit and debase the people. Now this long train of connected circumstances and events, tending to raise the military spirit of one nation, and to depress that of another, is certainly never, in the whole of it, the effect of human contrivance, foresight and ordination, of which it appears to be, at least in a great measure, independent. It must be ascribed at last to that di∣vine providence, which superintends and over-rules all things. It is, in short, like the fabulous golden chain of the poets, hung down from heaven to earth; the upper end whereof is far above mortal reach and sight, and there fastened to the throne of God!— Whenever, therefore, success in war is more immedi∣ately owing, as it often is, to such a superiority of martial prowess and bravery, it may be said, with the greatest truth and propriety, that God's
<Q>right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. SUCCESS is sometimes owing, more immediately, to neither of the things already mentioned; but to one
<PB N="20" REF="008668_0018_102FB2063A8936D8"/>
nation's having a greater plenty than another of mi∣litary stores, provisions, and all things necessary for prosecuting a war to advantage: Or, to its being richer, which comes to much the same thing at last; for, as Solomon has observed,
<Q>Money answereth all things.</Q>
But whence is it that one country abounds with provisions, with all things needful in carrying on a war, or with riches; while another is barren, desti∣tute of these conveniences, and poor? None of my hearers, certainly, need to be informed from whence, or from whom, these differences originally proceed: Who it is that giveth corn and wine, wool and flax; that multiplieth the flocks of the shepherd, and feed∣eth the cattle upon a thousand hills; that has ap∣appointed
<Q>a vein for the silver, and a place for the gold where they fine it; while iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the stone,</Q> where he has deposited them: Or, who it is that has ordain∣ed and opened the canals of commerce between coun∣try and country, either more or less convenient for mercantile intercourse, for the exchange of commodi∣ties, and supplying those places with silver and gold, which are naturally destitute of them. Will you ex∣clude God and his providence from having done these things? Surely you will not. Whenever, therefore, success in war is owing more visibly and immediately to such plenty, abundance, or superior riches, the vic∣tory is plainly the Lord's: Who giveth these supplies, in various proportions as he pleaseth, out of his own exhaustless stores and treasuries, to different nations, realms and kingdoms: None of which possess more of them, than they possess by his favour and bounty.</P>
<P N="6">6. WHERE nations are equal, or nearly equal, in all those respects that have been mentioned, there is yet sometimes health enjoyed in one camp or army,
<PB N="21" REF="008668_0019_102FB2518A5EE458"/>
while sickness prevails in that of the enemy; which is the more immediate cause of success and victory to the former. Yea, less numerous armies, and inferior in every other respect, have prevailed by this means; while far superior ones have become an easy prey to them. But whence does it come to pass, that sickness rages in one country, camp or army, rather than in ano∣ther? or this particular year, rather than another, either fore the war commenced, or after it is over, and all is decided? I will not suspect any present to be so sceptical, or rather so atheistical, as to hesitate a mo∣ment for the true answer to these demands. When∣ever, therefore, victory or success is owing to the greater health enjoyed in one army than in the opposite, you see to whom it must be attributed at last.</P>
<P N="7">7. SUCCESS, when all other circumstances are nearly alike, is sometimes most apparently owing to winds, tides and weather; which prove favourable to one fleet or army, and unfavourable to the opposite. In all maritime wars, and all military operations which have any connexion with, or relation to, the mighty waters of the ocean, or even to lakes and navigable rivers (as indeed almost all national wars have, espe∣cially in this age of the world); in all such wars, a great deal depends upon weather, winds and tides. These are sometimes so ordered, as to give success and victory even to the inferior fleet or army. Some∣times the superior fleet suffers a terrible shipwrack, and all designs miscarry therewith; while the inferior rides safely in port, or sails securely just beyond the limits of the storm, under a serene sky, and prosper∣ous gale. Sometimes a numerous army is obliged to remain inactive, and is perhaps half starved, because the wind has held long to the northward or the south∣ward, to the east or west; and the expected supplies
<PB N="22" REF="008668_0020_102FB207C65D8440"/>
have miscarried; perhaps, been driven on the enemy's coast, as a seasonable relief to them. Yea, sometimes when well appointed armies have met on the field, and have had no connexion with seas, lakes or rivers; the wind, rain and hail from heaven, by at∣tacking one of them in front in the time of battle, have been the means of putting it to the rout, and giving the victory to the weaker army. History fur∣nishes examples of all these things. Now you are sensible, that winds and tides, storms and tempests, which have such a mighty influence in wars, especially in naval ones, are no ways dependent upon human wisdom or power; but upon almighty God. So that whenever they prove favourable to one side, and un∣favourable to the other, and determine the success; we can ascribe such success to none but to him, who holdeth the waters in the hollow of his hand; whose pleasure, snow and hail, rain and vapour, and stormy winds fulfil; and of whom it is said,
<Q>There is none like the God of Jessurun, who rideth upon the heavens in the help of his people, and in his excellency upon the sky.</Q>
Deut. xxxiii. 26.</P>
<P N="8">8. SOMETIMES success is owing, more immediately, to what is vulgarly termed a mere accident, and which Solomon himself calls chance.
<Q>I returned, and saw under the sun, says he, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong—but time and chance happeneth to them all</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ecles. ix. 11. The word <HI>chance</HI> is divers times used in scripture in much the same sense; and particularly in our Saviour's account of the man that "fell among thieves." Luke x 31.
<Q>And by <HI>chance</HI> there came down a certain priest that way,</Q>
&amp;c.</NOTE>. That is, some unfore∣seen, unsuspected turn, incident or circumstance, not owing to any human providence or contrivance, some∣times gives the race to the slower, and the victory to
<PB N="23" REF="008668_0021_102FB2530FB16138"/>
the weaker. It were indeed very absurd to suppose, that the swifter should not win the race, all other things and circumstances relative thereto being alike; and the only difference lying in the respective swiftness of the runners. This were as absurd as to suppose, that a winged arrow from a bow, would not reach a distant goal, tho' there were no obstruction in the way, sooner than the sleeping, almost motionless snail would crawl to do it. It were also irrational to sup∣pose, that the stronger army should not prevail in the field, all other things and circumstances being alike; and the only difference lying in their respec∣tive power. This were as absurd as to suppose, that a heavier weight should not preponderate in an equal balance, and overcome a lighter. We may be sure that Solomon was too much of a philosopher to intend either of these things, so contrary even to common sense. His meaning, as intimated before, doutless is, that certain cross accidents, sinister and unsuspected occur∣rents, or casualties, sometimes intervene as to one side, or some favourable ones as to the other; and snatch the victory from the stronger, yea, from the wiser and braver, giving an unexpected triumph to the less nu∣merous and valiant host. As also the swifter, and more expert runner, may be vanquished by running at a disadvantage, by making one slip, or a single mis-step. Thus it is that, in the language of Solo∣mon, time and chance happen to all men. And that great victories have sometimes been thus obtained by inferior, over superior armies, without any real miscon∣duct of the one, or any wiser or braver conduct in the other, history abundantly attests. Thus, for illustra∣tion, the better general, with the superior army, has not always had, nor could have, his choice of ground: Perhaps he was a stranger to the country, and a little too far advanced, or not quite far enough, when he
<PB N="24" REF="008668_0022_102FB2094C1C5780"/>
was necessitated to come to a battle at a great disadvan∣tage; which has been the occasion of victory to the weaker, by whom perhaps the particular time and place of battle, were as unsought for, i. e. as accidental, as they were to the former. So again, when the best dispositions have been made in an army before a battle, upon a rational presumption that the opposite army would be drawn up after such or such a manner, this has proved, perhaps, the loss of the day; there being an order of battle in the latter, materially different from what was, on good grounds, expected: And this possibly, rather by a mere mistake, or blunder, than from any superior skill in the art military. So that wisdom on one side, and want of it on the other, have, by a strange kind of fatality or accident, contri∣buted equally to take the victory from the stronger! Yea farther: Battles have been lost by the stronger, thro' some unaccountable mistake of orders, or only of a single word at a critical juncture, and gained by the weaker; to which decision of the day, another, but fortunate mistake in the latter, may have partly contributed! History, I think, affords examples of all these things; at least, such examples as are a sufficient ground for these representations: Tho' if it did not, yet these things are plainly supposeable accord∣ing to the course of nature; which is sufficient. And this may in some measure serve to illustrate and verify the observation of Solomon, that the battle is not always to the strong; but that time and chance happen to all. Indeed some of those things which were mentioned under former heads, might be redu∣ced to this of time and chance, according to this noti∣on of it; particularly winds, weather, &amp;c. under the last preceeding head: which things are, as to us, con∣tingent, accidental or casual; no ways dependent up∣on human providence and ordination.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="008668_0023_102FB25495FDE9D0"/>AND how many things of this kind are there, which come to pass from age to age, sometimes quite con∣trary even to rational probability, as well as without any human contrivance, to frustrate the devices of men?
<Q>For man knoweth not his time, as the fishes that are taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it falleth suddenly up∣on them <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eccles. ix. 12.</NOTE>.</Q>
Thus it is that Solomon illustrates his own meaning about time and chance, in the verse immediately following. But are those things which are chance and accident to us, short-sighted mortals, the same to God, to whom, it is said,
<Q>all his works are known from the beginning of the creation?</Q>
Can we think that such things, which tho' seemingly little in one view of them, yet give such great turns to the affairs of nations, and are relatively of such prodigious importance to the world, are accidental with regard to God; or that they happen beyond, or be∣side, his intention! Certainly we cannot, without the greatest impiety, and the greatest absurdity, in con∣junction. No: The less man has to do in the con∣trivance, ordination and production of them, i. e. the more accidental and fortuitous they are with relation to man, the more immediately and directly are they to be attributed to God. These things, by whatever name or names they are called, are doubtless ordain∣ed by him to be productive of such and such conse∣quences; and, at the same time, to confound human pride and arrogance, that no flesh might glory in his sight. In one word, these are, without all doubt, a very material part of that great plan of divine provi∣dence and government, which are carrying on in the world from one age and generation to another. For even a sparrow does not fall to the ground without our
<PB N="26" REF="008668_0024_102FB20AD088F0D0"/>
Father; and when men cast the lot or die,
<Q>the whole disposing thereof is of the Lord<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi. 33.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>IT may just be added here, that the victory, and with it the civil and religious state of nations, has sometimes been determined by an unpremeditated re∣solution, or a <HI>lucky thought,</HI> as some would phrase it, coming into the mind of a commander in a decisive moment, one can hardly tell how. Altho' it was not owing to any superior sagacity habitual to him; yea, altho' the most wise and experienced generals would perhaps have agreed in looking on it as rash and un∣justifiable, yet it has succeeded. Of this there have been examples. And to what shall we attribute such victories and successes, but to that providence which superintends and directs all things; and to the influ∣ence of which, even chance and accident are subject, in accomplishing its own great designs!</P>
<P>MIRACULOUS interpositions being excepted, I can∣not readily think of any other things besides those mentioned above, which are the immediate, apparent causes of victory, and military successes; at least, of any which may not easily and naturally be reduced to them. And all these, we see, are to be resolved at last into the pleasure and providence of God. The wisdom of kings, their ministers, counsellors, military commanders, is all originally from him. It is he that multiplieth and increaseth nations; that giveth supe∣rior strength, courage, plenty, riches, health. Winds and seas, and storms, fulfil his pleasure: And what∣soever is, with respect to us, accident or chance, we must, unless we are epicureans or atheists, acknowledge to be in him fixed purpose, counsel and destination.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="008668_0025_102FB25C432C6C78"/>BUT if there should be any other things besides those mentioned above, to which success is ever more immediately owing; it must, however, be either owing to some qualities, powers and acts of subordinate agents intirely dependent on him; or else, to some more di∣rect influence and operation of the supreme, original cause; for there is no medium. If the former, still such successes are truly from God, according to the same reasoning that has been used above: But if the latter, then they are, by the very supposition itself, more immediately from him. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">IT is very supposeable that the omnipresent Spirit, which is "above all, and thro' all, and in us all", may often imme∣diately influence the human mind in its determinations, tho' quite imperceptibly. Or the ministry of angels may be em∣ployed for that purpose, and in a great variety of other ways, to the production of such effects and events as are spoken of above; of which there are more than obscure in∣timations in the scriptures of the old and new testament. And it is farther to be observed, that both these may be supposed, without any alteration in, or infraction upon, the visible established course of things, or the known laws of nature; such as is implied in the notion of a <HI>miracle.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHAT then is the result of all this, but that God really sits as Umpire on his eternal throne, between contending nations in all their contests, whether for right and justice only, or for proud dominion; giving success and triumph to which soever he pleas∣eth? And it is always to be remembered, that he acts herein the part, not merely of the sovereign, but of the infinitely wise and holy, just and good gover∣nor of the world. His providential government is not destructive of, but perfectly consistent with, the moral powers, the liberty, and proper agency, of his rational creatures; being conformable to the nature which he has given them. And he also exerciseth loving-kind∣ness, judgment and righteousness in the earth, by de∣fending
<PB N="28" REF="008668_0026_102FB20E59B68500"/>
and prospering one nation when engaged in war, and humbling or destroying another; ordering all things in the most perfect manner possible. Of this we may be sure in general, from what we know of his perfections by reason and revelation; altho', when we come to particular events and dispensations, we are indeed often unable to see the special reasons and designs of them. And how should it be other∣wise? It were infinitely absurd to imagine, that crea∣tures of such very limitted capacities as mankind, should be able fully to comprehend the immense designs and works of an infinite being. It were as rational to suppose that a child in the arms of its mother, should be able to comprehend, not only the oeconomy of the family, but of the great kingdom or empire, of which it was born a subject!</P>
<P>LET me here subjoin without any comment, a few passages of scripture, which being taken all together in one view, very fully and strongly express whate∣ver has been said upon this subject.— "Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine. Both riches and honor come of thee, and thou reignest over all; and in thine hand is power and might, and in thine hand it is to make great, and to give strength unto all <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">1 Chron. xxix. 11, 12.</NOTE>"— "MINE UNDERSTANDING RETURNED UNTO ME, and I blessed the Most High—whose dominion is an ever∣lasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation.

much strength. An horse is a vain thing for safety; neither shall he deliver any by his great strength.

<P>THUS I have offered some things in order to illus∣trate and confirm that important point of doctrine mentioned in the former part of this discourse. And let the impious <HI>Mezentii</HI> of the earth boast ever so often, that their "right hand is their God <NOTE N="§*" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>Contemptor Divum Mezentius —</L>
<L>Dextra mihi Deus, et telum, quod missile libro,</L>
<L>Adsint! —</L>
<BIBL>Virg.</BIBL></Q></NOTE>;" yet it
<PB N="30" REF="008668_0028_102FB2148B3DBF20"/>
appears that there is ANOTHER, whose right hand, and his holy arm, does, and will, get HIM the victory. We are not to suppose a fatality in the events of war, inconsistent with any real liberty in man. Nei∣ther are we to suppose, that these important events are so precarious and fortuitous with respect to our selves, that we can never form a rational or probable judg∣ment concerning them, before-hand. But, accord∣ing to reason, to scripture and experience, the Author and Lord of nature does so over-rule and controul mankind in the exercise of all their powers and facul∣ties (without destroying them); and so order almost innumerable other things—every thing indeed, rela∣tive to the conduct and issue of wars, as to hold these events in his own hand; and to keep men in a conti∣nual dependence on himself. A nation can never be certain of success in war; so many things unexpect∣edly intervene from time to time, by God's ordination, to frustrate the most sanguine hopes. And sometimes, on the other hand, contrary to all apparent probability, God supporteth, raiseth, and crowneth with victory, those that were cast down, without strength or spirits, and seemingly on the brink of destruction. That some nations are in fact thus disappointed and humbled, and others exalted, quite contrary to human probabi∣lity, none will deny: And he that will ascribe these events, ultimately, to any thing else than to divine providence, has an
<Q>evil heart of unbelief in de∣departing from the living God.</Q></P>
<P>SOME of these last observations might be, in a mea∣sure, exemplified in the turn which the present war has taken within about three years. There has sel∣dom been so great a change in the face of any war in so short a space, as this took about that time. In what sea did our fleets, just before, support the ancient ho∣nor
<PB N="31" REF="008668_0029_102FB25F51220C20"/>
of the British flag? Where were not our troops defeated and disgraced? What part of our extended frontier in America, was not drenched with blood? What countenances did not appear dejected, except of those, who were not the friends, perhaps the enemies, of their country? In what nation were we not become a bye-word and an hissing? while the very savages despised and insulted us. How wonderfully is the scene changed since? Where are not the British fleets and armies now victorious? How many? what important conquests and acquisitions, have been made? What satisfaction appears in the face of every well-wisher to Great-Britain, and her dependencies? If war, horrid war, can ever wear any other than a hide∣hus form, it may now be said to have put on a smiling countenance with respect to us. But, like the fabled <HI>Janus,</HI> whose temple was always open in a time of war, it has two faces. If with one it smiles on us, with the other it certainly frowns on our enemies, par∣ticularly here in America. They now feel all that we either felt or fear'd from them heretofore, ex∣cepting the effects of savage cruelty and treachery; which God grant they may never feel from the hands of Britons, or British subjects! Whatever they may deserve, we certainly owe more reverence to our selves, and to human nature, than at once to disho∣nour and debase both, by retaliating their perfidy and barbarity. This were as much beneath us, and even more, than for a man of virtue and true honor to be∣come a common executioner. Such work is fit only for them, and for <HI>him</HI> "whose works they use to do."</P>
<P>DIVERS things have been mentioned in this dis∣course, as the more immediate, apparent causes of military successes and victories; sometimes one of them, sometimes another, and sometimes several of
<PB N="32" REF="008668_0030_102FB21610B74818"/>
them in conjunction; all by the determinate counsel and ordination of heaven. It would be an unneces∣sary, perhaps an indecent inquiry, To which of these things the great change in the face of the present war, and our military successes for several years past, have been more especially owing? since this might lead to such comparisons as ought not to be made. There has, I suppose, been a co-incidence of several of these things, to the production of such happy and glorious events: Wisdom, and sound policy at the helm: mi∣litary skill, spirit and magnanimity in the commanders of our fleets and armies<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Not, however, without some exceptions.</NOTE>: courage, discipline, and martial prowess in the troops: plenty, health, &amp;c. And what may seem to have had as little hand, per∣haps, as any thing, in most of our successes, is that which was distinguished by the name of accident, or chance. However, this is not to be wholly excluded from having had a share therein: For in all military affairs and enterprizes, after human policy, wisdom and bravery have done their best, there will still be something, more or less, left to the decision of chance; that is, in other words, left to be determined more immediately by the hand and providence of God. Let it suffice, that our successes are real and great; and that, by whatever means they have most visibly been obtained, they are originally from God, to whom the glory of them is therefore due.</P>
<P>I AM, by God's leave and help, in the afternoon to make some more particular observations and re∣flections on our late military successes, especially in the total reduction of Canada; and also briefly to consider, what aspect these successes have upon the enlargement, and more general establishment of Christ's kingdom in the world: which is the grand
<PB N="33" REF="008668_0031_102FB260F0E38C78"/>
and glorious event to which my text, and the whole psalm relates, in its ultimate view. And we should remember, that in the common course of things, the great designs of God's kingdom and grace are carry∣ing on in the world, even by means of wars and the sword. All these commotions are preparatory and in∣troductory to the glorious things foretold of the latter days; when,
<Q>from the rising of the sun, even un∣to the going down of the same, the name of God shall be great among the gentiles; and in every place incense shall be offered unto his name, and a pure offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mal. i. 5.</NOTE>.</Q> While perhaps kings, or even whole nations, are proudly struggling for mutual revenge, or for extended empire and dominion, without a thought of any thing farther; there is ONE who, tho' invisible to mortal eye, presides over, and directs all, with far other views and designs; with designs and views infinitely more wise, just, bene∣volent and august: And whatever HE wills is desti∣ny. For there is no understanding, or counsel, or might against the Lord. Sooner shall man that is a worm, and the son of man that is a worm,
<Q>break God's covenant of the Day, and his covenant of night, so that there shall not be day and night in their season<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxxiii. 20.</NOTE>,</Q>
than frustrate his purpose as ex∣pressed in the prophecy following—
<Q>The God of heaven shall set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed; and the kingdom shall not be left to other people; but it shall break in pieces, and consume all these kindgdoms, and it shall stand for ever<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Dan. ii. 44.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>LET us, my Brethren, be truly sensible, that it is to God we are indebted, not only for all our late mi∣litary successes, but for life, breath, and every blessing
<PB N="34" REF="008668_0032_102FB2190E0B4E70"/>
which we enjoy.

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">H</SEG>AIL, Happy day! and thanks to HIM that made it such! This is indeed a good day, which the Lord hath made for us to be glad and rejoice therein: A day which, if not many prophets, yet many wise and righteous men have desired to see; and which we their posterity are so highly favoured of God, as now to behold. Let us therefore sing a
<PB N="36" REF="008668_0034_102FB21F20816558"/>
new song unto the Lord, whose right hand, and his holy arm hath gotten him the victory; whereby he hath made known his salvation, and shewed his righ∣teousness to the heathen.</P>
<P>WHEREVER the singing of a new song is mentioned in scripture, as it is in divers other places, it has a reference to some very singular event, by which God manifests his power and glory; his loving-kindness to his people, or his just severity in the punishment of their enemies. And it was observed to you in the morning, that this passage, and the psalm in general, has a retrospect to some remarkable appearances of God's providence in behalf of his people Israel. This is not, however, the ultimate view of the psalm, or of this passage in particular. It is not merely of the historical, but also of the prophetic kind; looking forward to the great things then, and still future; which are most surely to come to pass in the latter days, under the reign of the Messiah: When God will more signally display his salvation, and openly shew his righteousness to all the gentile nations;
<Q>giving his son the heathen for his inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for his possession.</Q>
Agreeably whereto, the apostle John tells us, that he heard a new song sung; in which, it seems, the whole rational creation bore a part—
<Q>And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth; and such as are in the sea, and all that are in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honor, and glory, and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the lamb for ever and ever<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Vid. Rev. v. 9 — 13.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P>THE text in its ultimate design and view, leads our thoughts to the time when this new song shall be sung, on occasion of those great things and glorious events,
<PB N="37" REF="008668_0035_102FB26A1F2D7DB8"/>
hereafter to be accomplished; of which God's mak∣ing known his salvation to his people of old, and shewing his righteousness to the heathen in, and round about the land of Canaan, was typical, and a kind of pledge. But the present occasion leads us more par∣ticularly to consider this passage, as an exhortation to praise God for the temporal deliverances with which he favours his people, and the successes and victories which he grants them over their worldly enemies. However, it was intimated to you, that I should not quite lose sight of this passage considered in its ultimate design, or as having a prophetic reference to the glory of Christ's kingdom in the latter days: Especially since those successes with which God hath lately fa∣voured us against our papal and heathen enemies, may possibly, or rather probably, be one means of, and a step towards, the final accomplishment of those far greater things which are shortly to come to pass.</P>
<P>THE main business of my discourse in the morn∣ing, was to illustrate and confirm an important point of doctrine contained in the text: viz. That God is truly the author of all our deliverances from, suc∣cesses against, and victories over, our worldly enemies. His right hand, and his holy arm, saith the psalmist, hath gotten him the victory, &amp;c. This is indeed the foundation of all our <HI>religious</HI> joy and gratitude on such occasions as the present. It was therefore thought proper to enlarge upon this point. And ac∣cordingly we traced some of the foot-steps of divine providence, and the various methods of its operation, in giving salvation and victory to those whom it fa∣vours; and in accomplishing its own great designs. But having already said what may serve in some measure to clear up and establish this important prin∣ciple of natural and revealed religion; and also made some short, general reflexions on our late military

successes: It will now be proper to take a nearer, and more particular view of these successes, especi∣ally here in America, in the reduction of Canada; which, you are sensible, is the principal occasion of our appearing before God this day to sing a new song of praise to him. However, some other successes with which God hath lately favoured the British arms in other parts, will not be wholly omitted.</P>
<P>SOME of my hearers may probably remember, that on the day of our public thanksgiving the last year on the surrender of Quebec, the capital of Canada, I considered the importance of that acquisition, not so much in itself, as with reference to what might proba∣bly be the consequence thereof another campaign, viz. the intire reduction of the whole country: Some of the happy effects whereof were then represented to you, upon a presumption that this must be the conse∣quence of that acquisition, with the ordinary blessing of providence on the British arms; or unless some∣thing out of the common course of things, should in∣tervene to prevent it. I now heartily congratulate you, my friends and brethren here present, and bless the great, the eternal God, who presides over nations and their affairs, that he has not frustrated those our hopes; but fulfilled and realized them, in some res∣pects even beyond what we could have reasonably expected. But having heretofore considered the sur∣render of Quebec in connexion with the supposed re∣duction of Canada, as the natural consequence; and spoken somewhat particularly of the advantages which must result to Great-Britain and her colonies from such a conquest; you are sensible that I have hereby in some measure anticipated the joy and gratitude of this day; and precluded myself from saying divers things, which might otherwise have been proper on
<PB N="39" REF="008668_0037_102FB26BD89B7810"/>
the present occasion: I mean, unless I should go into a repetition of the same things; of which I am not fond.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, since it is proper to say something par∣ticularly upon this conquest, in order to excite our gratitudge to the supreme Governor of the world, from whom salvation and victory come; I shall not scrupulously avoid every thing that was mentioned on the occasion aforesaid: But, touching briefly on those things which were then chiefly enlarged upon, I shall now speak more especially of such as neither were, nor could be, taken notice of at that time, without the spirit of prophecy.</P>
<P>LET us then consider the compleatness of this conquest; the great importance of it to Great-Bri∣tain and her American colonies; the little loss of men with which it has been effected; and some of the foot-steps of providence therein. After which, we will take a cursory notice of some other of our military successes since the time of our last public and general thanksgiving: All which together, afford us the agreeable hopes of seeing the present calamitous war soon brought to a happy period, and demand our most grateful acknowledgments to the God of armies.</P>
<P>WE may now, with the greatest propriety, consider the conqust of Canada as compleated. The French no longer hold a single sort, garrison, or fortified place, in that country; but there has been a formal surren∣der of the whole by the governor-general thereof to the British commander; the principal parts whereof had indeed before been brought under, and subdued by force of arms. From what we have already heard, it may be reasonably supposed that the far greater part of the inhabitants of New France are before this time become British subjects; having taken an oath of allegiance
<PB N="40" REF="008668_0038_102FB2222F89DC60"/>
at least of fidelity, to his Majesty: While the regular troops and marine companies of France, with all officers civil and military, and other persons of any distinction who might promote disturbances, are em∣barked, or embarking, for their mother country. The British troops are actually in possession of all places and posts of any consequence, such as they desire to possess; and in sufficient numbers. So that if there should be any effort made by the French with their savages to recover the country from their conque∣rors, it must certainly, without a miracle, be to no purpose. Tho' there is not the least reason to suspect there will be any such mad attempt made: Especi∣ally when we consider that the French who remain in the country, are disarmed; that the savages in those parts, with whom they are forbid any commerce, are become our allies; and lastly, that the English gene∣ral has shown so much clemency and humanity to the Canadians, as to have endeared himself to them, and, as we are informed, to make them consider him, not so much their conqueror, as their protector and deli∣verer from their old tyrannical masters.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is credibly said, that M. Vaudreuil, the late governor-general of Canada, was almost universally detested by the Canadians for his pride, avarice and cruelty.</NOTE> In short, we may look upon this country as effectually subdu∣ed; as effectually as it could have been, unless fire and sword had been carried thro' it from one end to the other, to devour without mercy all that came in their way: Which were equally inconsistent with the genius of the religion we profess, and with the true bravery and generosity of Britons, how agreeable so∣ever it might be to the bloody religion, to the savage spirit, and the butcherly conduct of our enemies: And it may be added, how much provocation soever they have given us, by their former treacheries and barba∣rities, to treat them in the same manner whenever it should be in our power.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="008668_0039_102FB26D5D541268"/>THIS conquest of New France is most important in its nature and consequences, as well as compleat. The country itself is large and fruitful; many parts of it well cultivated, and much more populous, as well as fertile, than we were taught to believe in times past. This conquest adds at once a large extent of territory to the British empire in America; and a great number of subjects to the British crown, who may in time be∣come very useful ones. All the Indians bordering on Canada, will, or rather are already, become our friends and allies. None of the American savages are now our enemies, excepting two or three tribes on the back of our southern colonies, in the interest of the French of Louisiana. These have indeed lately committed the most horid outrages, accompanied with the black∣est treachery; taught them, doubtless, by the great masters thereof, the French, at whose instigation they commenced their hostilities. However, this rupture with those savages will probably be of no long conti∣nuance. They received a considerable check the last summer, in the destruction of some of their towns. And they will doubtless be awed by the late successes of the British arms; and by plainly seeing the English now so superior in America, that they can have no dependence upon the French, either for supplies or protection. God hath made known his salvation, and openly shewed his righteousness, to all the heathen nations in these parts of America; who were no stran∣gers to the persidy, the wicked designs and practices of the French. These savages who, like some more refined politicians, chuse always to be on the strongest side, have in times past been industriously fed up by the French with an opinion of their great superiotity; that they should be able at length to subdue us, and make a conquest of the whole country. But the eyes of almost all of them are now sufficiently opened;
<PB N="42" REF="008668_0040_102FB2253429ED78"/>
and those of the few others, cannot long continue shut. They will probably expect in a short time to see Louisiana in the <HI>same situation with Canada</HI>—Nor are they slow to discern, or backward to follow, their own interest. So that we may reasonably depend on hav∣ing them all in a manner our friends, from Hudson's Bay to Lake superior; and from thence southward to the gulph of Mexico. Instead of having any of them to disturb, and break up our infant settlements from time to time, as heretofore, we shall have a large and profitable trade opened with them; even with nations whose very names were lately unknown to us. Our colonies, it may be supposed, will enjoy peace for the future; and with the common blessing of providence, be greatly increased and enlarged in the course of a few years.</P>
<P>THESE things will directly and manifestly tend to the emolument of Great-Britain, by prodigiously in∣creasing the demand for her manufactures, enlarging her commerce, and augmenting her maritime power: Especially if the North-american cod-fishery should be all, or chiefly, in the hands of British subjects. The French themselves who shall remain in Canada, will be to be supplied with European commodities from Great-Britain, as well as the savages in America, and her own colonies, probably in a short time increased beyond what many persons will easily conceive at present. And even the inhabitants of Great-Britain will be greatly multiplied hereby, if not in proportion to those of her colonies; since many more thousand persons of different occupations, will, by such a vast demand and consumption of her manufactures, readily find the means of subsistence, than can do so at present; which is doubtless the reason why she is not more po∣pulous. So that if the strength and honor of a nation consists in the number of its industrious people, in an
<PB N="43" REF="008668_0041_102FB275379F3260"/>
extended commerce, and in riches, whereby she is enabled to raise armies, to equip mighty fleets, and to maintain both as occasion requires; these are the advantages which will in the ordinary course of things result to the British, from the late success of his ma∣jesty's arms in America.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The things hinted in this paragraph were more particularly mentioned in the Author's 2<SUP>d</SUP> discourse the last year, occasi∣oned by the surrender of Quebec: And they are since set in a very full, clear and strong light in a Tract lately published in London, and re-printed here, entituled, <HI>The Interest of Great-Britain considered with regard to her Colonies,</HI> &amp;c. In this judicious Tract it is computed, that in one century the number of British subjects on this side the Atlantic may probably exceed that now on the other; and that Great-Britain herself is capable of containing and supporting <HI>ten times</HI> the number of people she does at present, could they but find employment by the increased demand, and proper returns, for her manufactures. To which nothing can contribute so much, and so certainly, as the growth of her American colonies.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE reduction of Canada, so important in its na∣ture and consequences, has, thro' the good providence of God, been compleated with very little loss of men: With far less, indeed, than could well have been ima∣gined, considering the number of the enemy, the vi∣gorous effort they made to recover their capital early in the spring; and (to give them their due) the spirit and resolution which they have shown on some other occasions since this war commenced, to defend their country, and to give trouble and annoyance to us. In which attempts they have divers times been far more successful, not only than we could have wished, but than was to the honor of the British arms. Witness Oswego, Fort William Henry, and more especially Ticonderoga! Witness also Fort Du Quesne, and the banks of the Monongahela, still perhaps white with
<PB N="44" REF="008668_0042_102FB22AFA083380"/>
the bones, if not red with the blood, of our slaughter'd troops! When we reflect on these things, adding thereto, that the enemy were lately in possession of several posts and passes lying between our armies and them, strong both by nature and art; and that they had the advantage of a perfect knowledge of the country, of which we knew but little: When we re∣flect on these things, could it have been supposed that general AMHERST, with all his address, his patience and magnanimity, would have been able to compleat the reduction of Canada almost without any loss of men? Excepting those which were drowned in passing the difficult and dangerous rapids above Montreal, and those who have been taken off by sickness, I think the whole loss amounts but to about an hundred <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">i. e. Since the 25th of April, 1760.</NOTE>; in taking the arm'd vessels of the enemy on the lakes, and several strong forts advantageously situated, and vigourously defended, of which it was necessary to become masters before the army, or rather armies, could arrive at the island of Montreal, where it was commonly supposed the chief scene of action would be. But when the three <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">One by the way of lake Ontario, one by lake Champlain, and the other from Quebec.</NOTE> armies were drawn near together at that place by their respective leaders, but all under the general direction and orders of ONE; it seems that general AMHERST had little more to do than to make his own terms, and to receive the surren∣der of Montreal and the whole country from the French governor: Little else, I should have said, un∣less it were to keep their own enrag'd savages from falling upon the French to plunder, butcher and scalp them in their turn, by whom these savages had been so long deceived and abused.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="008668_0043_102FB276C328DE50"/>THE enemy, tho' numerous and well supplied, were sensible of the superior wisdom and military accom∣plishments of the British general, the bravery of his officers and troops. They were astonished at his having surmounted all obstacles in his advances towards them; wherein they tho't they saw the evident foot∣steps of divine providence, and from whence they pre∣saged their approaching fate. They were at the same time so well satisfied of the clemency and honor of general AMHERST, that they prudently chose to lay down their arms and submit, rather than hazard a battle. And by what we hitherto learn, the terms granted to, or rather imposed on them, were as ho∣nourable to the British general and arms as we could have desired; tho' still more favourable to the French than <HI>such</HI> enemies, all circumstances considered, had any right to expect. For tho' all that were found in arms, were to be sent out of the country, and not to serve during the present war, against his majesty or his allies; together with other persons of any distinction; yet it seems, the main body of the people are permit∣ted to continue in the country, and to enjoy their e∣states under the protection of the British government, on taking an oath of allegiance, or fidelity to his majesty. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">It is said, the articles of surrender were pretty numerous; but what they are, is not yet particularly, at least not pub∣lickly known amongst us. They were signed Sept. 8. 1760.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS has this great conquest been compleated, as was said before, with an inconsiderable loss of men: A conquest which will in all probability be followed with very extensive happy consequences, both as to Great-Britain and her American colonies, whose true interests are absolutely inseparable: A conquest which is likely to be advantageous to the Canadians them∣selves,
<PB N="46" REF="008668_0044_102FB22CD08B0FC8"/>
who with their posterity may live in the coun∣try under the English government, and be far more happy than under the French tyranny: A conquest to the honor, not only of the arms, but the humanity of Britons: And a conquest wherein the vestiges of divine providence have been very conspicuous. There is no need of adding, A conquest which will forever render memorable and illustrious the name of that discrete, wise, and truly magnanimous general, who, under God, has effected it; and thereby put so happy and glorious a period to the war in this part of America.</P>
<P>THEY who are acquainted with the geography of North-America, may possibly suppose that the re∣duction of Montreal and Canada might have been sooner, and more certainly effected, by one grand army by the way of St. Lawrence, than by several smaller ones, conducted thro' such tedious and diffi∣cult routs as those of the lakes; especially that of lake Ontario. But there are now probably none but what are convinced, that the plan which has been laid and pursued, was, upon the whole, far the best. The general, by thus dividing his army, and coming against the enemy on all sides, hemm'd them in, prevented their escaping, or dispersing here and there in small parties; and so has accomplished the whole business at once. Whereas, had they been attacked only by the way of St. Lawrence by one grand army, they would doubtless have abandon'd Montreal at its ap∣proach; retreated together up the river, where they could hardly have been pursued, or else gone off in parties to the southward and westward, and otherways, with their arms. So that tho' Montreal had been in our possession, yet the country might in effect have remained still unsubdued. This, not to mention some other things, seems to show, that that which
<PB N="47" REF="008668_0045_102FB278988CD210"/>
some persons possibly imagined a more difficult, ex∣pensive and precarious way of compleating the re∣duction of Canada, was in reality the best; perhaps the only one, in which the conquest could have been perfected this campaign —But I shall say no more of what may seem foreign from the business of a sermon —It is sufficient to our present purpose, that God has appeared very graciously for us in conducting this great enterprize to so happy a conclusion; from whence we may reasonably promise ourselves such great and permanent advantages as have been hinted at above.</P>
<P>BUT when I speak of the importance of this ac∣quisition, you will doubtless observe, that I go wholly upon the supposition that it will be retained. What may possibly be hereafter; what different turn the war may take; what real occasion and necessity there may be for relinquishing this, or any other conquests, in order to a peace, no one can certainly tell. But while things continue in such a posture as they are at present thro' the goodness of God; while we have so fair a prospect of having it in our power, as we shall on that supposion certainly have a right, to insist upon indemnification for the immense expence of treasure and blood, to which the ambition and injustice of France has lately put us, as also upon security for the future to these American colonies: while we have such a prospect, I say, I thought it hardly decent to make the supposition of Canada's ever being deli∣vered up to France; which might be looked upon as a kind of treason. At least it might betray, either such a disaffection to the welfare of Great Britain and her colonies, or such a distrust of the wisdom and integrity of our superiors, as I wou'd not on any consideration be thought capable of. And one would think that
<PB N="48" REF="008668_0046_102FB22E56ABF868"/>
the other European nations should all in general re∣joice to see some bounds set to the power, and ambi∣tious views of France. For, which of them has she not hector'd and threatned in its turn? Which of her neighbours has she not plunder'd and robb'd? some of them of wealthy cities, some of provinces, and others of whole countries? Which of them can be secure against her intriegues, treachery, and lawless violence, unless she is in some measure humbled and weakned?—There would doubtless be sufficient rea∣son for a day of general <HI>thanksgiving</HI> thro'out Europe, if this were done to purpose.</P>
<P>AS was observed before, tho' we cannot tell what may yet come to pass in the course of this war, we have reason to hope from present appearances, that there will be no necessity of making such a dear and important sacrifice as that of Canada, in order to pro∣cure a peace: the consequence of which would be, that the almost immense treasure expended in driving the French from their encroachments, and in reducing this country, would be scarce better than thrown away. The French would soon renew their en∣croachments and hostilities, and set their savages again to scalping. We can never live peaceably with them here as neighbours: For it is almost as impossible for them to cease from those treacherous and wicked practices, to which they have been so long "ac∣customed", as it were for the "Aethiopian to change his skin, or the leopard his spots". Nor would the interest of Great Britain be less affected in the end, than that of her colonies, by their regaining their power and independence in Canada: Of which there is at present, indeed, no apparent reason to be ap∣prehensive, considering how prosperous, by the bles∣sing of heaven, his majesty's arms have been in other
<PB N="49" REF="008668_0047_102FB27B94D7D890"/>
instances: For an almost uninterrupted series of suc∣cesses has attended them for several years past.</P>
<P>AND here let me take occasion just to mention some other material successes that have <HI>lately</HI> crowned the British arms in other parts of the world.</P>
<P>SINCE the day of our common and public thanks∣giving on the surrender of Quebec, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">October 25, 1759. The author in his discourses published on that occasion, and in the year preceeding▪ took notice of the most considerable and important successes obtained by his majesty's arms by land and sea, since the beginning of this war. For which reason he does not here look any farther back than to the date above.</NOTE> we have re∣ceived advices here, of some considerable advantages obtained in the East-Indies, in the reduction of several of the enemy's fortresses and factories, with some of their settlements there. And Pondicherry, according to our latest accounts, was the only place of which the French were left possess'd in those parts.</P>
<P>THE Dunkirk squadron under the command of the valiant, but unfortunate <HI>Thurot,</HI> has been chiefly ta∣ken or destroyed, after going thro' a long series of calamities and disasters.</P>
<P>ABOUT the same time, one of our admirals <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Sir Ed. Hawke.</NOTE> fell in with the grand fleet of the enemy from Brest, where it had been long preparing, in order, as was given out, to cover a discent on the coast of Britain or Ireland. This fleet was beaten, and dispersed amongst the shoals upon the coast of France <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Quiberon bay.</NOTE>; when five or six capital ships were taken and destroyed: While a num∣ber of others, as it is said, were render'd useless, by
<PB N="50" REF="008668_0048_102FB28EF25C0B48"/>
being oblig'd to fly for safety to land, to rocks, and into shallow rivers. In this important affair there were some pretty remarkable circumstances. The Bri∣tish admiral's falling in with this fleet, was most oppor∣tune and seasonable for us, as it was unexpected to the enemy. The French fleet was going to take un∣der her convoy a large number of transports lying rea∣dy in different ports, after having gotten out of Brest by stealth while the British fleet was withdrawn. And indeed the latter did not again sail from its port in the English channel, 'till the very day the other stole out; a circumstance not unworthy of notice, since, humanly speaking, the French fleet had a fair prospect of reach∣ing its port, or ports, before it could be overtaken. And this it had probably done, had not an inferior En∣glish squadron fallen in its way, by which means it was retarded for some time. This fleet was so infe∣rior to the French, that it must in all probability have fallen an easy conquest thereto. But at the in∣stant when so unequal an engagement was to begin, appeared admiral HAWKE with the British flag, and a formidable fleet: Which not only made the enemy glad to quit their destin'd prey, but struck them with such terror, as even render'd them incapable of a pru∣dent and successful flight. Thus was the little English squadron at once preserved; the design of the French fleet rendered abortive; the great preparations of the enemy for a descent, insignificant; and their most pow∣erful fleet disgraced and ruined upon their own coasts: A mortifying spectacle to the people! And upon the whole, this seems to have been almost a finishing blow to the marine, and naval power of France, before re∣duced so low by repeated disasters and losses. In all which, the hand of providence is very conspicuous.</P>
<P><PB N="51" REF="008668_0049_102FB2812E16D018"/>WE have lately had the report of the very signal vic∣tory obtained by his majesty's army under prince FER∣DINAND, over the formidable French army commanded by marshal <HI>Broglio.</HI> Which, if true, will not only preserve Hanover a third time, when threatned with imminent danger; but must have an happy in∣fluence on the affairs of his majesty's illustrious ally, the king of Prussia. But this important news does not appear to be so authentic, that we may be justified in giving full credence thereto at present<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">We had this news from Lisbon. It was reported that prince Ferdinand had kill'd and taken about 50,000 men, and in∣tirely routed the French army on the borders of Hanover. But we have since had the mortification to be assured, that this was a false rumour; tho' it seems some considerable advan∣tages have been gained by the allied army. And since the delivering this discourse, we have also had the authentic news of his Prussian majesty's defeating a large corps of the Austrian army; killing and taking about 10,000 men, with near 90 pieces of cannon, ammunition, &amp;c. &amp;c. A most agreeable and important piece of intelligence.—</NOTE>. And in∣deed, if one half we have heard were known to be fact, our apprehensions for Hanover might now be over, as also in part, those for his Prussian majesty in this critical conjuncture. Our welfare even here in Ame∣rica, is now nearly connected with that of this illustri∣ous king, and of his majesty's Hanoverian dominions. What the purposes of heaven are with respect to them, time only will reveal. And if they should maintain their ground this year (God almighty grant they may!) we should have good reason to hope, not only that this may prove the last campaign of the pre∣sent war; but that such a peace will be concluded, as will be at once glorious to Great-Britain and her allies, and happy for all her dependencies; particularly for her colonies in America. But if, contrary to our hopes, the war should still be protracted, we may take it for granted that Great-Britain, under so wise, firm
<PB N="52" REF="008668_0050_102FB29078F71970"/>
and vigorous an administration as the present, will pursue her advantages; and perhaps, by the favour of heaven, add LOUISIANA at least to her other acquisitions: A conquest, tho' of vast importance, yet, humanly speak∣ing, of very little difficulty, considering the naval power of Britain, and the number of British troops now in America. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Since this discourse was delivered, we hear there are more troops actually embarked for North-America. If it be so, it seems not improbable that Louisiana may be the object of their destination: From which country, while the French are possess'd of it, our southern colonies will probably meet with disturbance; at least by means of murdering and scalp∣ing parties sent from time to time upon their frontiers.</NOTE></P>
<P>BUT having thus reminded you of those successes with which God has lately favoured the British arms, more especially in the conquest of Canada; all which seem to promise an honorable peace, future se∣curity to us here in America, and many advantages both to Great-Britain and her colonies; and which therefore demand our grateful praises to the supreme Governor of the world: Having done this, I say, let us now proceed, as was proposed, briefly to consider, what aspect these victories and successes have upon the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ; its farther exten∣sion, and the accomplishment of those glorious things which are to come to pass in the latter days.</P>
<P>IT would indeed be at once just matter of re∣proach to a christian minister, and a kind of affront to a christian assembly, if in preaching upon such an occasion as the present, he wholly confined his views and discourse to things of a secular nature; without considering what relation these important successes have to Christ's kingdom. This would be∣tray
<PB N="53" REF="008668_0051_102FB282CCDC6778"/>
in him a littleness and narrowness of mind, and a want of due regard to, and zeal for, the honour of God, or the interest of religion in the world. It would also be treating his auditors as if he supposed them wholly immersed in worldly cares, without a thought of any thing greater or better than a short-liv'd prosperity here below; which, I persuade my∣self, is not the character of those to whom I am speaking. And besides; that passage of scripture, on which my discourse is grounded, naturally leads our thoughts to that time, when our Lord shall take to himself his great power, and reign as the king of nations, as well as of saints.</P>
<P>NOW there are two things to be laid down here, as principles on which to proceed, they being cer∣tainly and plainly foretold in the holy scriptures. One is, That God will at length in a most wonder∣ful manner bring down, humble, and even destroy, that corrupt and apostate, that idolatrous and per∣secuting church, variously described in the holy scriptures; particularly under the character of a woman, "having a golden cup in her hand, full of abominations and filthiness of her fornica∣tions. And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, Babylon the great, the mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth"<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. XVII. 4.5.</NOTE>—"The great whore, which corrupteth the earth with her fornica∣tion."<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Ch. XIX. 2.</NOTE>—"And in her was found the blood of pro∣phets, and of saints, and of all that were slain upon the earth."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Cha. XVIII. 24.</NOTE> That that apostate, antichristian church, or kingdom, which is thus emblematically described, is to have her plagues made wonderful, and to be finally brought to ruin, is most manifest from the sacred scriptures. Nor can protestants in this age, one would think, be at any great loss, what church, or where she is—</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="008668_0052_102FB293810D8FD0"/>THE other thing alluded to above, is, That the gospel of the kingdom is not only to be "preached for a witness" among all nations, but to be actually established thro'out the world, amongst Jews and Gentiles. For "the kingdoms of this world are to become the kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign forever and ever."<NOTE N="‖" PLACE="foot">Rev. XI. 15.</NOTE> The scrip∣tures are full of prophecies to this purpose; which predictions remain to be fulfilled, either sooner or later, unless we have believed fables instead of the word of God, who cannot lie.</P>
<P>NOW we may consider the great successes which God has given to the British arms in the present war, as tending, in some measure, to the accomplishment of both these events; the destruction of the papal power, and the establishing of christianity thro'out the world.</P>
<P>FOR first, as to the former of them: These suc∣cesses have been obtained by a protestant king and nation, against the greatest and most powerful na∣tion in the communion of the church of Rome. The French monarch is unquestionably the most po∣tent of those kings who have "given their kingdom unto the beast." But his power is now much di∣minished, and seems in a fair way to be farther re∣duced. And this will be in effect diminishing that of the roman pontiff. Every new accession of power to our own, and to other protestant kings and states, will also tend to the reduction of that of Rome. It may be farther observed here, that as learning in∣creases, and runs to and fro in the earth, the influence and authority of the pope declines, as the natural and necessary consequence thereof: And it is now
<PB N="55" REF="008668_0053_102FB28451DD2E60"/>
far less, even in most or all roman catholic countries, than it was some centuries since. It has declined fast since the beginning of the reformation; when, and since, divers kings and nations, and our own among the first, came to an open rupture with the pope; utterly disowning his jurisdiction over them. The king of Portugal has also lately come to such a rupture with him, as is not likely to be soon healed; and as may, not improbably, issue in the pope's losing forever all authority in that kingdom, how∣ever devoted the common people may be to him at present. Nor would it be very strange if the king of Spain should soon break with him also: Since the jesuits, most probably with the pope's conni∣vance, if not by his direction, have been plotting a∣gainst that crown, as well as the king of Portugal; and have actually been carrying on a war against the subjects of both, in South America. But be that as it will, it seems morally impossible, consider∣ing the progress which learning has made, and is still making, but that the eyes of all the kings, states, and people in general, now in the communion of the church of Rome, must before long be opened. And when they shall plainly see, how grosly they have been deluded, and how impudently tyrannized over by her, they will of course become her enraged ene∣mies; and be avenged on her, as many have been already. For, in the language of inspiration,
<Q>These shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate, and naked, and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire. For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to agree, and give their king∣dom unto the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled. And the woman which thou sawest, is that great city, which reigneth over the king's of the earth.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Rev. XVII. 16.17.18.</NOTE></Q>—This remarkable prophecy is
<PB N="56" REF="008668_0054_102FB285D5C91A48"/>
partly fulfilled already, in the breaking off of so many kings and states from the church of Rome; and their becoming enemies, and sore scourges to her pride and impiety; of which nations our own is the principal. And we may rest assured, that this prediction shall in the whole of it, and possibly be∣fore long, be punctually accomplished. In the prospect of which final ruin coming upon the great whore, or mystical Babylon, the apostle John broke forth thus—<Q>Rejoice over her thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and prophets; for God hath aveng∣ed you on her. And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more at all.<NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot">Rev. XVIII. 20, 21.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>BUT secondly, as to the propagation and establish∣ment of the gospel amongst all nations: Our mili∣tary successes may be considered as one step towards the accomplishing of that great event also. Not that the gospel of Christ is to be propagated by force of arms; but these successes may in some mea∣sure open and prepare the way for spreading it, by methods suitable to the genius and design of this religion.
<Q>The weapons of our warfare are not carnal; but mighty thro' God</Q>—And <Q>the servant of the Lord must not strive, but be gentle unto all men; patient, in meekness in∣structing those that oppose themselves, if God peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth.</Q></P>
<P>THERE are many heathen here in America, who have long had some intercourse both with Us and
<PB N="57" REF="008668_0055_102FB28D6B091AE8"/>
the French. We have heretofore made attempts, by the blessing of heaven to "turn them from dark∣ness to light, and from the power of satan unto God." But these our attempts have not been at∣tended with any great success; with less indeed, than the endeavours of the French missionaries, I had almost said, to make them apostatize from heathen∣ism to popery. Many discouragements and obsta∣cles have been in the way hitherto; some of which are now removed. And there seems to be a fairer prospect, by the blessing of God, of doing some∣thing considerable to this end, than ever there has been in times past; provided there be wisdom, in conjunction with a proper zeal, in undertaking and prosecuting so good a design. God hath in some sense already made known his salvation, and openly shewed his righteousness in the sight of these hea∣then, by the victories, and great successes which he hath given us over our enemies in these parts. So that we may suppose, they will be under less tempta∣tion to say now, than heretofore, "Where is their God?" The prejudices which many of them have imbibed against us and our religion, by means of the French missionaries representing all protestants to them, as bad or worse than atheists, may now in some measure be abated: At least we shall have a better opportunity, and greater advantages, for re∣moving these prejudices, than formerly; and to convince all those pagans who have had any know∣ledge of Us and of the French, that our God is indeed in heaven; and that it is no other than he, whose right hand, and his holy arm hath given us, or ra∣ther gotten to himself, the victory. They will pro∣bably be influenced in some degree to think favour∣ably of us and our religion, by our great successes, and triumphs over those who have ever represent∣ed
<PB N="58" REF="008668_0056_102FB299D490DCB0"/>
us as the enemies of the true God; and to whose vain boasts of their being his peculiar favourites, to whose threatnings against us, and repeated constant treacheries, they have been no strangers; and many of them indeed, the instruments of their wicked and villainous designs.</P>
<P>TO these things it may be added, that these nu∣merous tribes of heathen, when they find themselves wholly dependent upon us, as they must be, will probably become in all respects more submissive and tractable than they used to be, either to us or to the French, in times past. They could formerly change sides, and run from one to the other on any trifling occasion; and held, as it were, the ballance of power between us in their own hands. In these cir∣cumstances they thought they had a right to be courted by both, as they actually were: Which made them, if possible, more proud, insolent and barbarous than they naturally are, as well as indocile to the last degree. But their having now only one European people on which to depend for necessary supplies, if a reasonable, just and wise use is made of this advantage, it will without doubt give us such an ascendency over them, as will greatly facilitate the work of humanizing and christianizing them.</P>
<P>WE find, agreeably to what has been said above, that the Six Nations are within a few years become more tractable than they used to be; I mean, since they have seen the French power upon the decline here, and in a fair way to be entirely destroyed. Those of them who attended general AMHERST in∣to Canada, it is said, were very docile, subject to discipline and command. Yea, they were tutor'd by him into some regard to clemency and mercy;
<PB N="59" REF="008668_0057_102FB29BE337EA38"/>
to which they were heretofore almost intire stran∣gers. We are informed, that when they had taken several hundred prisoners on Montreal, who expect∣ed nothing but to die in tortures, the savages re∣lieved their anxiety by telling them, their orders were, not to put any of their captives to death; tho', as they added, the French used to order their In∣dians to kill all that fell into their hands. A just and severe reproach; which shews, we need not despair of humanizing and christianizing the American savages; and which must have stung their prisoners to the soul, if they were not past feeling! And how agree∣able? how edifying must it have been, to hear those savages thus reproaching these good catholic chris∣tians, the subjects of his <HI>most christian</HI> majesty, for their barbarity; and trying as it were, by their own better example, to infuse into them some sense of humanity! And, by the way, it may be hoped that the French themselves who shall remain in Canada, or at least their posterity, will become protestants, provided prudent and proper methods, consistent with justice and humanity, are taken to make them so.</P>
<P>YOU see from what has been said, that we have now more encouragement than ever to attempt the christianizing the American heathen; some of the obstacles thereto being removed by the late signal successes of his Majesty's arms. And were this ac∣complished, it would be at once a considerable en∣largement of Christ's kingdom, and partly the ac∣complishment of that promise, that the <HI>uttermost</HI> parts of the earth should be his possession. Our successes in the East Indies, and the growth of our settlements there, where the natives are still more numerous, and less savage than in America, bids fair to be a means in time of spreading christianity
<PB N="60" REF="008668_0058_102FB29D68E71D78"/>
in those parts also—And upon the whole (for I may not enlarge) if we attentively look round the world; if we consider the increase of knowledge, both reli∣gious and natural, ever since the reformation began; and that it is growing more and common in all civilized nations, whereas it used before to be con∣fined to a few persons; if we reflect on the drop∣ping off of one kingdom and state after another from the church of Rome; if we consider the great increase of navigation and commerce, carried on from Europe into all parts of the known world, more especially by protestant nations; and the many factories, settlements and colonies from christendom, established in the most remote countries; if we re∣flect on these things, I say, not to mention any thing at present of the order of the prophecies, there seems to be some reason to hope the time is not far distant, when both the roman papacy shall come to nothing, and the gospel shall be propagated throughout the world; the knowledge of God co∣vering the whole earth as the waters cover the seas. Though, by the way, whenever these things shall be accomplished, whether sooner or later, they will not probably be effected wholly by natural and hu∣man means: But by them in conjunction with the extraordinary effusion of the Holy Spirit, with the most signa!, undeniable manifestations of God's power and grace in favour of his true worshippers, and the equally visible manifestations of his wrath, and righteous displeasure against others; especially those who wilfully uphold errors and corruptions in his church: For this is undeniably the scripture account of the matter. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><P>Some of the obstacles hitherto in the way of gospelizing the savage nations in North America being now removed, it may be hoped that the right honourable and reverend SOCIETY <HI>for propagating the gospel in foreign parts,</HI> will, amongst other objects of their charitable attention, hereafter make this a <HI>principal</HI> one. And it was with great pleasure, that the author of this discourse lately read the following passage in Dr. ELLIS'S sermon before that venerable <HI>Society</HI> the last year, at their anniversary meeting—<Q>Out of grati∣tude for this wonderful goodness of God to us, says his Lordship, we ought freely to contribute to the advance∣ment of his glory, which he graciously places in the wel∣fare of mankind. And we are directed to FIT OBJECTS of our charity—There are on the borders of our na∣tional colonies and plantations in America, multitudes of savages immersed in gross ignorance and superstition, who either have not heard at all of the gospel of Christ, or at least are very far from a competent knowledge, and due practice of it. For these, WITHOUT QUESTION, we ought to have a proper concern, and to use our endea∣vours for their effectual conversion, as there may be op∣portunity.</Q>— Dr. ELLIS, Lord Bp. of St. David's.</P>
<P>We may almost assure ourselves, that this very important and <HI>seasonable</HI> hint of his Lordship, will have its due weight with the <HI>Society;</HI> and consequently, that these American savages will not be so much forgotten and neglected as they have been heretofore. All the <HI>good people</HI> in New England, where the gospel has been <HI>generally</HI> so well preached ever since its settlement, would doubtless rejoice to see such large sums as are annually expended in supporting episcopal mis∣sions here, applied to the carrying on this good work a∣mongst the heathen, "who know not God." In New-Eng∣land only, near 30 of these missions (besides schools) are now maintained at the charge of that venerable <HI>Society:</HI> The members whereof can however certainly have no <HI>views</HI> in the particular applications of their own and others charity, but what are worthy of persons of the greatest fidelity, catho∣licism and honor, fir'd with a truly primitive zeal to propa∣gate <HI>primitive christianity,</HI> and <HI>only that.</HI> Tho' it is pro∣bable that they have been grosly imposed upon by false re∣presentations of the state of religion in these parts; which has been the occasion of their employing so much of their charitable care about those who so little needed it, to the neglect of those who were perishing for want of it: For which impositions, abuses and misapplications, their de∣ceivers are answerable; if not to them, yet certainly to an HIGHER AUTHORITY.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="008668_0059_102FB2A367B1CDE0"/>A FEW reflexions on the present subject and occasion, must now conclude this discourse, almost too long, I fear, already.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="008668_0060_102FB2A4EC0633E0"/>IT becomes us to be sincerely and devoutly thank∣ful to almighty God, who hath delivered us from our enemies in these parts, and crowned the arms of our king with so many successes and victories. We have abundant cause for gratitude, both on tempo∣ral and spiritual accounts: For both our civil and religious privileges are secured to us by these suc∣cesses; and there is a fair prospect, that both we and our posterity may possess this good land in great peace and prosperity. Let us be admonished to make it manifest, that we have a proper sense of God's undeserved goodness to us, by forsaking all our evil practices; whatever is displeasing in his sight, and serving him in holiness and righteousness according to the gospel of his Son: As free, and not using our liberty for a cloke of maliciousness, but as the servants of God. "For so is the will of God, that with well-doing we may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men." The praises of our lips, even tho' we sing unto the Lord "a new song," without the obedience of our lives, will be a very inadequate return to him for the many and great mercies which he hath bestowed upon us, up∣on our king and nation. Let us therefore keep all his holy commandments; especially let us do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with our God.</P>
<P>LET us moreover, in this way of well-doing, place our hope and trust in God for the continued smiles of his providence upon us, upon the British counsels, government and arms, till the present ca∣lamitous
<PB N="63" REF="008668_0061_102FB1F002BF04A8"/>
war is brought to a happy conclusion: And not only so, but till all the enemies of our holy re∣ligion are either brought to repentance, or to ruin; and the gospel of peace shall every where prevail.
<Q>IT is a righteous thing with God to recom∣pence tribulation to them that trouble</Q>
his faith∣ful and obedient people. And we may look upon our late victories and successes, in conjunction with some other things, as pledges and earnests of the final triumph of the church of Christ over all its enemies. Tho' they were not, I suppose, particu∣larly pointed at in any of the prophecies; yet we may look upon them as a partial accomplishment of God's general promises of deliverance and salva∣tion to his people, and his threatnings against the enemies, at least the corruptors, of his gospel. They should therefore encourage us to hope in him for the entire and complete fulfilment of both; when the just shall be established, and
<Q>the wickedness of the wicked shall come to an end.</Q></P>
<P>HOW solid a foundation have the true worship∣pers of God according to the gospel, for peace and composure of mind, in reflecting on his superintend∣ing providence amidst all the wars and commotions of the nations, and all the revolutions in states and kingdoms? The righteous are still secure under the shadow of the Almighty. And these changes and revolutions, when the kingdoms are moved, are in effect only God's overturning, overturning, over∣turning, until He shall come in his kingdom, whose right it is; and every tongue shall confess him to be Lord, to the glory of God the Father. "Therefore will not we fear, tho' the earth be removed, and tho' the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea: Tho' the waters thereof roar and be troubled; tho'
<PB N="64" REF="008668_0062_102FB2A6703A5040"/>
the mountains shake with the swelling thereof— There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city of God; the holy place of the taber∣nacles of the most High. God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall help her, and that right early." <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Psalm XLVI.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHILE we praise God for the late favourable, and very signal appearances of his providence, in causing us to see our desire upon our enemies, we should beware of every thing that has a tendency to frustrate the designs of his goodness towards us, and to turn his blessings into curses; particularly of pride, effeminacy and luxury. These are commonly the attendants of peace, outward prosperity, riches and security; and therefore ought to be particularly guarded against. When Jeshurun of old waxed fat, then he kicked, and forgat the God that "rode up∣on the heavens in his help, and in his excellency up∣on the sky." And thus it often comes to pass, that even the prosperity of fools destroyeth them. All history, ancient and modern, sacred and profane, is a proof of these things; and should serve for a warning to us. The Persians, Greeks and Romans, amongst innumerable other nations, were successive∣ly examples of the fatal consequences of great pros∣perity without wisdom and virtue.</P>
<P>DURING the time of ancient Carthage, the only dangerous neighbour and rival of Rome, when the conquest of the former was meditated by the latter, there was a debate in the roman senate, whether this were expedient or not, if practicable. While some thought it would be equally glorious and hap∣hay for Rome to crush the only dangerous rival of
<PB N="65" REF="008668_0063_102FB2AF38A18348"/>
her power and greatness, others were apprehensive of the consequences thereof. They feared lest they should by means of such a conquest, and the peace, wealth and security naturally following, become luxurious, effeminate and corrupt, to their own de∣struction in the end. This proved no imaginary or groundless fear: When Carthage was no more, and Rome had subdued all her neighbouring enemies, she seemed indeed for a while to be more happy than ever: But in process of time, riches and secu∣rity produced the most fatal effects; the most ex∣travagant luxury, venality, and a total depravation of manners. And when her citizens had no longer any foreign enemy to fear, they fell into violent factions, contentions, and civil wars. They lost their liberty in the end; became wretched by means of their own prosperity and greatness; and so the roman power was destroyed. Thus did luxury, the most formidable enemy to any state when it becomes common, invade and triumph over ancient Rome, which had triumphed over all her other enemies; hereby fully revenging on her, not only the fall of Carthage, but of a conquer'd world. <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><Q><L>—Saevior armis</L>
<L>Luxuria incubuit, victumque ulciscitur orbem.</L>
<BIBL>Lucan.</BIBL></Q></NOTE></P>
<P>SOMETHING not wholly unlike to this, may pos∣sibly befall us in time, the American Carthage being subdued, unless God should give us the wisdom to avoid those rocks and shelves on which so many have split, and suffered a wretched shipwrack. Di∣vine providence has set up beacons and land-marks in every age and quarter of the world for our warn∣ing and direction; and if we do not take due no∣tice of them, our destruction will be almost certain,
<PB N="66" REF="008668_0064_102FB2B0C15337D8"/>
while, as an aggravation of it, we shall have no claim even to pity.</P>
<P>BUT to draw to a conclusion: While we bless God for our repeated and great successes against our heathen, and other idolatrous enemies, let us take heed that we ourselves do not depart from the plain, simple doctrine and worship of the gospel, or con∣form to any of the corrupt principles and modes of worship established in the world. We ought not to leave the clear light of revelation, and the "sure word of prophecy," to run after the <HI>ignes fatui</HI> of human creeds, which appeared in the dark and cor∣rupt times of the church, and have ever since con∣tributed more or less to mislead the christian world. It becomes us to adhere to the holy scriptures as our only rule of faith and practice, discipline and wor∣ship. The "mother of harlots" has many daugh∣ters in christendom; "all nations have drank" more or less,
<Q>of the wine of the wrath of her for∣nication.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Revel. XVIII. 3.</NOTE></Q> There has indeed been a great re∣formation in many nations from some of the grosser errors, superstitions and corruptions introduced by the papacy, and still upheld in the church of Rome. But in what country, in what nation, is the refor∣mation complete? In what national, or even pro∣vincial church, are not some of these errors and cor∣ruptions found? It is worthy of observation, that immediately after St. John heard a mighty angel pronounce the fall and utter ruin of mystical Baby∣lon, he
<Q>heard ANOTHER voice from heaven, say∣ing, Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.
<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Chap. XVIII. ver. 4.</NOTE></Q> It nearly concerns all those who still any ways symbolize with the leader in the grand
<PB N="67" REF="008668_0065_102FB2B26E618CE8"/>
apostacy, seriously to attend to this divine admoni∣tion. There is ONE who walketh in the midst of the golden candlesticks, holding the stars in his right hand; whose eyes are as a flame of fire, and his voice as the sound of many waters:
<Q>And all the churches shall know,</Q> saith he, <Q>that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts; and I will give unto every one of you according to his works.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rev. II. 3.</NOTE></Q> His fan is in his hand, and he will ere long thoroughly purge his floor, his church and kingdom, of those numerors errors and abuses which are found in differents parts of it. And altho' these errors and corruptions are perhaps even gloried in by some churches as their distinguishing ornaments and excellencies, the breath of the Lord shall one day puff them all away like chaff and rubbish, with the <HI>wilful</HI> authors and upholders of them, to be con∣sumed in the fire of his indignation. They alone, who worship the FATHER in spirit and in truth, shall be established. Christianity, long obscur'd and disgraced by the additions which human pride, hu∣man folly and wickedness, have made to it, shall at length be restored to its primitive simplicity, beauty and glory, and become a praise in the whole earth. <NOTE N="§" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>We have Moses and the prophets, and apostles, and the word of Christ himself; and if we will not hear them, we shall be more inexcusable than the Jews. For the prophets and apostles have foretold, that as Israel often revolted and brake the covenant, and upon repentance renewed it; so there should be a falling away among the Christians, soon after the days of the apostles; and that in the latter days God would destroy the impenitent re∣volters, and make a new covenant with his people. And the giving ear to the prophets is a <HI>fundamental character of the true church.</HI>—The authority of emperors, kings and princes is human. The authority of councils, synods, bishops, and presbyters, is human. The authority of the prophets is divine, and comprehends the sum of religion, reckoning Moses and the apostles amongst the prophets. And <HI>if an angel from heaven preach any other gospel,</HI> than what they have delivered, <HI>let him be accursed.</HI></Q>
<BIBL>Sir I. Newton's observations on Daniel.</BIBL></P>
<P><Q>The event of things predicted many ages before, will then be a convincing argument that the world is governed by providence. For as the few &amp; obscure prophecies con∣cerning Christ's <HI>first</HI> coming, were for setting up the christian religion, <HI>which all nations have since corrupted;</HI> so the many and clear prophecies concerning the things to be done at Christ's <HI>second</HI> coming, are not only for predicting▪ but also for effecting a recovery and re-estab∣lishment of the <HI>long-lost truth,</HI> and setting up a kingdom wherein dwells righteousness.</Q>

"This," to adopt the language of the pro∣phet, "This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth; and this is the hand that is stretch∣ed out upon all nations. For the Lord of Hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isai. XIV. 26 27.</NOTE> Tremble! ye avowed enemies, and all ye wilful per∣verters of the gospel, or upholders of error and su∣perstition in the church of Christ, to subserve the ends of your own vain ambition and secular interests: Your perdition lingereth not! And lift up your heads with joy, ye sincere followers of the Lamb of God: For your redemption draweth nigh! And to encourage all such to adhere steadfastly to the faith and worship of the gospel according to the holy scrip∣tures, in opposition to the many gross corruptions thereof at this day in most parts of christendom:
<PB N="69" REF="008668_0067_102FB2BB21CCFFF8"/>
To this end, I say, let me now close this long dis∣course with the words of our blessed Lord himself to the angel of the church in Philadelphia: And whosoever <HI>hath an ear to hear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches!</HI>—"These things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shut∣teth; and shutteth and no man openeth: I know thy works — Thou hast a little strength, and hast kept MY WORD, and hast not denied my name. Be∣hold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan— come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I have loved thee. Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth. Behold I come quickly: hold that fast, which thou hast, that no man take thy crown. Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of MY GOD, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of MY GOD, and the name of the city of MY GOD, the new Jerusalem WHICH COMETH DOWN OUT OF HEAVEN FROM MY GOD.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Revel.
