<HEAD>Jockey <HI>TO THE</HI> Fair,</HEAD>

<L>'TWAS on the morn of sweet May day,</L>
<L>When nature painted all things gay,</L>
<L>Taught birds to sing, and lambs to play,</L>
<L>And gild the meadows rare:</L>
<L>Young Jockey early in the dawn,</L>
<L>Arose, and tript it o'er the lawn;</L>
<L>His Sunday's coat the youth put on,</L>
<L>For Jenny had vow'd away to run</L>

<L><HI>Jenny had vow'd, &amp;c.</HI></L>

<L>The cheerful parish bells had rung,</L>
<L>With eager steps he trudg'd along,</L>
<L>With flow'ry garlands round him hung,</L>
<L>Which shepherds us'd to wear:</L>
<L>He tapt the window—Haste my dear,</L>
<L>Jenny impatient, cry'd, Who's there?</L>
<L>'Tis I, my love, and no one near;</L>
<L>Step gently down, you've nought to fear,</L>
<L>With Jockey to the fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>My dad and mammy's fast asleep,</L>
<L>My brother's up, and with the sheep;</L>
<L>And will you still your promise keep,</L>
<L>Which I have heard you swear?</L>
<L>And will you ever constant prove?</L>
<L>I will by all the powers of love,</L>
<L>And ne'er deceive my charming dove:</L>
<L>Dispel these doubts, and haste, my love,</L>
<L>With Jockey to the fair.</L>

<L>Behold the ring, the shepherd cry'd,</L>
<L>Will Jenny be my charming bride?</L>
<L>Let Cupid be our happy guide,</L>
<L>And Hymen meet us there.</L>
<L>Then Jockey did his vows renew,</L>
<L>He wou'd be constant, would be true:</L>
<L>His word was pledg'd—away she flew,</L>
<L>With cowslips, tipt with balmy dew,</L>
<L>With Jockey to the fair.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>In raptures meet the joyful throng,</L>
<L>Their gay companions blithe and young;</L>
<L>Each join the dance each join the song,</L>
<L>And hail the happy pair:</L>
<L>In turns there's none so fond as they,</L>
<L>They bless'd the kind propitious day;</L>
<L>The smiling morn of blooming May,</L>

<L>My Chloe has dimples and smiles I must own;</L>

<L>Her lillies and roses were just in their prime,</L>

<L>Which is better than servilely cringing at court.</L>
<L>What though he all dusty and whiten'd does go,</L>
<L>The more he is powder'd, the more like a beau:</L>

<L>Gold in handling will stick to the singers like meal.</L>
<L>What if then a pudding for dinner he lacks,</L>
<L>He cribs, without scruple, from other men's sacks:</L>
<L>In this of right noble example he brags,</L>
<L>Who borrow as freely from other men's bags.</L>

Whose aim is alone their coffers to fill,</L>

<L>He eats when he's hungry, and drinks when he's dry,</L>

<L>Redundant, henceforth, may thy purple juice flow,</L>
