Such worship, alas! hath no charms for the soul,</L>

<L>With riot would bid the sweet vision be gone?</L>
<L>For the tear that bedews sensibility's shrine,</L>

<L>The tender excess which enamours the heart,</L>

<L>Come then, rosy Venus, and spread o'er my fight.</L>
<L>The magic illusions that ravish the soul,</L>
<L>Awake in my breast the soft dream of delight,</L>
<L>And drop from thy myrtle one leaf in my bowl.</L>

<L>Then deep will I drink of the nectar divine,</L>
