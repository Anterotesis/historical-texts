<HEAD TYPE="sub">"THE OECONOMY OF HUMAN LIFE" gave rise to the following performance.</HEAD>
<P>The first draught of it was only a versification of the oeconomy: but the author having since consi∣derably enlarged it without regarding the original, it cannot be called in it's present state a versification. And even the title it now bears "A PARAPHRASE" does not properly belong to it: for thô, in some parts of it, it may be a paraphrase; in other parts, the matter is not the same.</P>
<P>It is called "a paraphrase" for want of a more suitable title; and to shew not only, what it had it's rise from; but, the author's obligations to "the oeconomy".</P>
<P>If what is here offer'd to the public should not be disapproved; the remainder, or the whole together may perhaps, at some convenient time, be submitted to their censure.</P>

A remarkable one respects the Dutch: whose destruction (which he nearly accomplished in 1672) he meditated at the very time he settled a treaty of peace with them. The desperate remedy they had recourse to (which was the only one in their power) was the cutting of their dikes: by which means Amsterdam and all the adjacent country were laid under water. This stopped the progress of Lewis; and, thô it almost ruin'd them, prevented their total de∣struction. See the Age of Lewis XIV.</NOTE> age:</L>

<L>With equal rage, by passion toss'd, he raves:</L>
