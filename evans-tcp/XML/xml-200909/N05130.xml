<P>We all knew an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> teach, that they are only returning and reforming Prayers that will prevail with God; and 'tis to be doubted, that, in this dead and decayed Age, there are too many Prof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ssors who will joyn in the Design of Prayer, whom this must serve instead of Reformation; 'tis to such especially that the Directions on the inclosed Paper are intended.

<HEAD>A COMPANION FOR PRAYER.</HEAD>
<P>TO make Way for, and to press to the diligent observing the following Directions, let these three Things be premised.</P>
<P N="1">1. That the Power of Religion is much fallen, at least, is at a stand, among Multitudes of Professors of the present Day. Sure this needs no Proof, when we have so many sad ocular Demonstrations hereof before us.</P>
<P N="2">2. That for this, the Lord hath a Controversie with us at this Day, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.4. Whatever Controversie the Lord hath with the <HI>Belials</HI> amongst us,
<PB N="2" REF="006452_0004_1028F8CC1EEAA088"/>who<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> We<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>kedness hath even ri∣pened them for V<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ngo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ce, his special Quarrels seems to be <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣ple. We may <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> whom the soe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>. An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er is, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>bserving at wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>se Faces <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> are <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed. A<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> whom do our Enemies, the R<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Anger make a w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ce <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> and draw <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Tongue, and attempt their fiercest Hands?</P>
<P N="3">3. No Prayers will avail, nor have the least Help in them, but the Prayers of such, with whom the Lord's Contro∣versie is taken up and composed; those with whom he hath a particular Quarrel, are like to be unhappy Mediators for others. We chuse the Favourites of Princes to be our Intercessors with them.</P>
<P N="4">4. There can be no taking up GOD's Controversie, unless the Matter fit he∣re noved, by Repentance and Reforma∣tion, <HI>Rev.</HI> 2.5. <HI>Isa.</HI> 1.15, 16, 18. <HI>When ye make many Prayers. I will not hear, your Hands are full of Blood; wash ye, make you clean,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>Come now and let us Reason together.</HI> Josh. 7.10. <HI>Get thee up; wherefore liest thou thus upon thy Face? Israel hath sinned</HI>— they have taken the accursed Thing; and <HI>v.</HI> 12.
<PB N="3" REF="006452_0005_1028F8CFD5719FC0"/><HI>I will not be with you any more, except the accursed Thing be destroyed from amongst you.</HI> Is there no accursed Thing amongst, even the Professors of Religion? Behold the Wedg of Gold, and the <HI>Babylonish</HI> Garment, their Pride and their Cove∣tousness, hid in their Hearts for a Tent. God search out these, and every other accursed Thing within you, let them be destroyed, if ye would have the Lord to be at Peace.</P>
<P N="5">5. If there may be such a Spirit of Prayer stir'd up among us, as may have its Fruit unto Holiness, and real Refor∣mation of the Evils of our Ways; this would Comfort us, and give us great Hopes in the hardest Cases.</P>
<P N="6">6. Therefore, in all our crying to God for his Help, in Case of publick Fears, Dangers or Distresses, our Eye should be firstly upon, and we should wrestle with the Lord for the pardoning, purging, and Sanctification of our own Hearts and Lives; wherein if we pre∣vail not, we shall be as a rotten Tooth, or a Bone out of joynt, for any Help there is in us, or in any Thing we do; unless we can pray up a Spirit of Holi∣ness in our selves, a Spirit of Love, and
<PB N="4" REF="006452_0006_1028F8D24C6A92D8"/>of Power, and of a sound Mind, we are not like to do any Thing to Purpose, in praying down Mercy for the People; the Devil will give us leave to visit the Throne of Grace, so we will but carry our hard and uncircumcised Hearts with us; if we cannot get to be of the Lord's holy Ones, though we make many Pray∣ers, he will not hear; here the Interest and the Hopes of the People of God lye, in the shedding abroad of the sanctifying and quickning Spirit upon them; for this therefore should we firstly pray.</P>
<P N="7">7. 'Tis not praying alone that will do: to the bringing on our Reforma∣tion, there must be also a constant and sedulous Use of all God's other Means, in our whole Course of Life.</P>
<P N="8">8. Some of these Means are presented in the following Directions.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>General Directions.</HI></P>
<P>Direct. 1. <HI>Take up a deep and serious Design of making an advance in serious Religion.</HI> Set not down by, take not up with, what you have already attained, but resolve for reaching forward, and following after, towards that which you have not attained; content not your
<PB N="5" REF="006452_0007_1028F8D3D6AB3900"/>selves to drive gently on, as your Flesh will bear, but stir <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pvour selves to fol∣low hard after the Lord; and let this be the deliberated cree and intent of your Hearts. Say to thine Heart, How is it with me? Doth my Sold prosper? Are my Ways such as please and Lord? What is mine Expectation and mine Hope? What is the Aim and Business of my Life? is it that Christ may be magni∣fied by me, and that I may be made Partaker of his Holiness, and shew forth his Vertues in my Generation? Can I say with the Apostle, <HI>To me to live is Christ?</HI> Ah Wretch that I am! How deeply hath this Self and this World gone shares with my Lord! O! How little of my Time, my Parts, my Strength, yea, and of my very Heart also have been inclosed and consecrated as Holi∣ness to the Lord? How much of me hath been left out in common for the World? Well, but what meanest thou for the future? Wilt thou henceforth change the purpose and intent of thine Heart? Come Man, wilt take up a De∣sign for, and henceforth centermine, and set thine Heart upon a more watchful, fruitful and heavenly Life? If thou wilt
<PB N="6" REF="006452_0008_1028F8D64A9CC048"/>not be brought to decree, and resolve upon a better Life, much less wilt thou be perswaded actually to it. What's be∣gun well, is half done; and an holy Design deeply laid, is a good beginning.</P>
<P>Direct. 2. <HI>Let God's Calls to extraor∣dinary prayer, and a Sense of the necessity of your Recovery and Reformation, to year prevailing in Prayer, quicken you on in the vigorous pursuance of your holy Design.</HI> Now is a Time, wherein you have your Hearts at the Advantage, having such weighty Arguments before you, and the Opportunity of doing two such great Things more, as the saving of your selves and also o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the People, both from Ini∣quity and Calamity.</P>
<P>Direct. 3. <HI>Do all you do, in pursuance hereof, in the Name of the Lord Jesus.</HI> Be not discouraged at any prospect of Difficulty, trust in him for his Help. En∣courage your Hearts with the Words of the Apostle. <HI>Phil.</HI> 4.13. <HI>I shall be able to do all Things through Christ that strengthens me.</HI></P>
<P>Direct. 4. <HI>Keep your Eye and your Heart much upon God and the other World.</HI> Be able to say with the Apostle, <HI>Phil.</HI> 3.20. <HI>Our Conversation is in Heaven;</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="006452_0009_1028F8D9F6DA34B0"/>that is, there the Business of our Life lies; and that not only above spiritual and heavenly T<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>gs, but with God himself. Live at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="5 letters" DISP="•••••"/>t tain &amp; Spring∣head; thence all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>our l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ght, and Life, and Holiness, and Si<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>on<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>th must flow down. Be much in to king upwards; and beholding in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>a G<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>'s the Glory of the Lord, you will be changed from Glory to Glory, into the same Image, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.18. Look much and often upon the Things that are not seen, if ye would be delivered from the Power and ma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ign Influence of the Things that are seen; let your Eye be upon the Sun, and you will see a dimness and darkness upon the Earth; get you cloathed with the Sun, and you will get the Moon un∣der your Feet.</P>
<P>Direct. 5. <HI>See that there be no allowed Sin in your Heart or Practice.</HI> Psal. 66.18. <HI>If I rega<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Iniquity in mine Heart, God wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> not hear my Prayer,</HI> nor help me. An allowed Sin is as the dead Flesh in the Wound; whatever Methods or Medicines be taken, there will be no healing till the de<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>d Flesh be eaten off; you may profess, and pray, and hear all your Life long, and yet will never pros∣per
<PB N="8" REF="006452_0010_1028F8DC776248A0"/>whilest you are privy to any one indulged Sin.</P>
<P>Direct. 6. <HI>B<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>ant and in <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ant in day<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y, secret and family Prayer.</HI> Let not extraordinary Prayer excuse your ordina∣ry; and let not your neglect of ordinary Prayer unfit you or extraoordinary: Let not your Way to your Closet be untrod. He thath bolds h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> 3 Acquaintance in Hea∣ven, by being o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ten with God, w<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>li<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o the most like to prevail with God in the most pressing and difficult Cases; those that are much in Prayer, those are the Men that use to be mighty in Prayer.</P>
<P>Direct. 7. <HI>In all your Praying, both ordinary and extraordinary, let your Eye be</HI> (I say not chiefly, but) <HI>firstly upon the Case of your own Souls.</HI> What Im∣provement you obtain here will be of this double Advantage; 1. There will be the more hope of your being heard for the Publick. 2. If the Lord be not prevail'd with for publick Mercies and Deliverances, yet you will be the better prepar'd for Sufferings. If God should shew Mercy as to the Publick, should scatter our Clouds, and blow over our Scorms, should cause our Light to break forth as the Morning, and our Righte∣ousness
<PB N="9" REF="006452_0011_1028F8DE0DF8E780"/>also as the Noon-day; yet what would all this be to thee, who are un∣righteous? What would it be to thee, if in all the Land of <HI>Gos<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>en</HI> there should be Light, and thou in the midst thereof shouldest be covered over with the Darkness of <HI>Egypt?</HI> If there should be Dew on all the Grass of the Field, and thy Fleece only should be dry? If thou shouldest live to see thy People a saved People, and an holy and fruitful Nation, and thou should'st stand as a withered and dry Tree amongst all the flourishing Cedars? Get up thine own Heart into good Proof, or whatever spi∣ritual Plenty thou mayft see in <HI>Israel,</HI> yet thou wilt not eat thereof. Talk no more of thine Hopes of seeing good Days, how little would that be to thee, unless thou get thee a better Heart?</P>
<P>Direct. 8. <HI>Let your Prayers be fol∣lowed with a constant Care of your Ways.</HI> Let not your praying serve you instead of repenting and reforming, but let it quicken you to your whole Duty; let your entring into your Closet be your ascending heavenwards; and let not your returns thence be the falling down of your Souls from Heaven to Earth.
<PB N="10" REF="006452_0012_1028F8E0A356FF40"/>Let your Duties and Ways be all of a Piece; live l<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ke praying Children.

O! amend, amend, and see that thou continue not such a barren Soul; as low as 'tis with thee in Grace, think not to rise high, unless thou wilt make better Use of what thou hast.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Particular Directions.</HI></P>
<P>Direct. 1. <HI>Consider what it is where∣to you have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>eady uti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ined, and be thank∣ful; and thence be encouraged to press on and Hope for more.</HI> Hast thou abtained Grace from the Lord? And hath he caused his Grace to abound towards thee and in thee? And hast thou a witness within thee that thou hast not received the Grace of God in vain? But dost thou study to walk worthy of that Grace wherein thou standest? O rejoyce in the Lord, and let all within thee bless his Holy Name; and take what thou
<PB N="12" REF="006452_0014_1028F8E6A0D5FD98"/>hast thus received as an earnest of more. Set thy Foot upon the Neck of every morified Lust, take the more Heart to thee to go on in the Fight, and rejoice in Hope of a total and final Victory. The Soldier, when one Wing of his Ene∣mies Army is routed, or they do but give Ground, and begin to fall, this raises his Courage, and he falls more smartly on. Go thou and do likewise; and let thy beginning, much more thy growth in Grace, and thy Experiences hereof, be the oiling of thy Wheels, for thy more vigorous following on after yet a greater increase.</P>
<P>Direct. 2. <HI>Consider what your special Corruptions, Infirmities, Want<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Neglects, Temptations, or your most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rainary Falls are.</HI> 1.

What your special Wants or Weak∣nesses are in Point of Grace; what

What Temptations they are, by which you are most commonly assaulted or foiled. 5. What your most ordinary Falls are in point of Practice. And here let Professors of Religion be warned to consider, if they be not over∣taken (besides many others) by some of these three Evils. 1. An over-eager and greedy following after the World: The Zeal of some Mens Spirits after Riches, hath eaten up all their Zeal of God. O! Into what Poverty hath thy Soul fallen, whilst thou hast been so bus<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e in the World, and hast selt the P<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ospe<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ities thereof come <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rouding upon thee! Some rich Professors may remember the Days of old, and be troubled. This Thought, When I was but a little one in this World, then was it better with me than now; this Thought may be an Arrow in their Hearts, and kill the Joy,

It's now grown too creditable to fre∣quent drinking Houses: Tradesmen that are Professors, especially in Cities or great Towns, how ordinarily do they, upon Pretence of Dispatch of Busness, sit many Hours over a Dish of Coffee, or a Cup of Ale, or a Glass of Sack; and carry it so, that they can hardly be distinguished from the good Fellows of the World; but perhaps by this only, That they are now down-right drunken into Breasts. If there be a Liberty of such Houses, and meetings in them sometimes
<PB N="15" REF="006452_0017_1028F8EE8E669988"/>necessary (as perhaps it may) yet let not this Liberty be used as an occasion to the Flesh. 3. Gaudiness or over-cost∣liness in Apparel, wherein some of them glitter and shine amongst the greatest Gallants of the Earth. Some amongst Professors do not only shun but disdam and despise the old Self-denial that was wont to be among Christians in these and the like Particulars, as if they were set at Liberty by the Gospel from the Laws of Christ, as well as from the Law of <HI>Moses.</HI> To these three let me add one Evil more: 4. A neglect of your Fa∣milies; of the Instructing, Catechising, and due Disciplining them; the Conse∣quents of which Neglect are very sadly to be seen in the Ignorance, Errors, Rudeness and Disorderliness abounding amongst many of them: there are not a few, who take some Care of themselves, but leave the Bridle on the Necks of theirs, and reap many Heart breaking Crops in them, as the Fruits o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> their own Negligence.

<P>Now diligently search and consider thy self in all these Things; and when

<P><PB N="17" REF="006452_0019_1028F8F299190898"/>
This is to act rationally and in Judg∣ment; to bend our great Strength there, where our great Difficulty and Weakness lies. When you have by searching found out what you mostly stick at, let it be your first grand Errand in every Prayer, whether ordinary or extraordinary, to beg special Help in this particular Case: your weakness in any particular Grace or Duty, the Power of any particular Lust, Corruption or Temptation, your most ordinary and common Falls in Point of Conversation; let these have a special Place in every Prayer you make: And also let them be most heedfully watched and laboured against in your Lives. Turn in the Strength of Prayer &amp; Watch∣fulness upon the Strength of Sin; let your main Batteries be against the strong∣holds, and where your Walls are weak∣ned, there set the strongest Guard and Watch.</P>

Some Professors may at Times seem to be full of good Affections, strangely elevated and enlarged in their Prayers, yea, and to live in so great Peace, as to take themselves to have attained to the riches of full Assurance, and yet for all this may be but very poor Christians all the while. Let them be asked: How is it with your Soul? O! <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>bless the Lord, I find it very comfortable: I have sweet Communion with God in Prayer, and I live in the sweet and refreshing Light of his Countenance; he washeth my Steps with Batter, and has Sun shi∣neth upon my Paths; I thank the Lord I go comfortably on.

Hast thou founded a Retreat from thy eager chase after the geat Things of the World? Thou hast leen a Zealot for increasing thine earthly Substance, art thou now become more moderate? Thou wert once a sl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>thful, lazy Soul in the Matters of God, art thou now more diligent and industrious? Art thou servent in Spirit serving the Lord? Thou once lived a jolly, frothy and merry Life, dost thou not carry it with more Seriousness? Hast thou left thy lying and deceitful Dealing? Thou hast been a Self seeker and a Flesh-pleas∣er, but can't say, through the Grace of God, I have now betaken my self to a self-denying Life; and dost thou deny thy self in those very Things wherein thou wert us'd most to seek thy Self? Put thy self upon a close and severe Trial here, and know that if the strong hold be not battered and broken, it thine old Lusts do still hold their Power in thee, if the old Sore be still issuing out, the old Stream be still running its Course: If
<PB N="20" REF="006452_0022_1028F8FC8083CE30"/>thou canst not say, I have kept me from <HI>[mine]</HI> Iniquity, or at least am fighting more resolvedly against it; if thou still st<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>keft where thou wert wont to stick, (whatsoever flash thou seemest to have of good Affections, whatsoever Confidence thou hast of thy good Condition) 'tis a sure sign it is not so well with thee. Look to what degree of Success thou hast attained in those Things wherein thy great Difficulty lay; to such a degree of Soul Prosperity thou hast attained, and no more.</P>
<P>Direct. 5. <HI>Measure your Hopes of the answer of your Prayers for the Publick, by your Experiences of their speeding in your <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>n particular Cases.</HI> If thy Sin can stand before all thy Prayers, thine Ene∣mies, and Fears, and Dangers are not like to fall ever the sooner for such pray∣ing; what God may do upon the Pray∣ers of others, thou knowest not; but nothing is like to go the better for thee. If thou hast run with the Foot-men (within thee) and these have been too hard for thee, how wilt thou contend with them that ride upon Horses? If thou canst not stop the muddy Streams of thine own Cistern, how wilt thou
<PB N="21" REF="006452_0023_1028F8FE0962CD30"/>stand before the swelling of <HI>Jordan?</HI> If thy Prayers prevail so little to the seting thine own Heart, or thine own House in order, how canst thou think they they will do any Thing against the Hosts of the Uncircumcised? <HI>God heareth not Sinners;</HI> not only such Sinners as are in a State of Sin, and totally alienated from the Life of God, but even such also, who though for the main, they have been once washed in the Blood of Christ, are again fallen into, and wal∣lowing in the Mud and Mire of any one allowed Sir; they are all like to be but miserable Comforters in the Day of Distress. Remember that Scripture men∣tioned before. <HI>Psal.</HI> 66.18. <HI>If I regard Iniquity in my Heart, God will not hear my Prayer.</HI></P>
<P>But on the other Side, if thou dost obtain, if thou dost prevail in thine own personal Case, this hath good Hope in it. 'Tis an Argument that thy Prayers are accepted with God; and if the Lord accept thee when thou prayest for thy self, or for thine House, thence the greater Hope will spring that he will accept thee when thou prayest for his own House and People. And if he doth
<PB N="22" REF="006452_0024_1028F8FF945283C0"/>accept thee for them, he will either de∣liver them out of their Distress, and thou shalt have the honour to be one of those for whose sake Deliverance comes; or if he should not grant thy Requests as to the Publick, yet he will not fail to give thee thine own Soul for a Prey, tho' he do not give thee the Lives of them that sail with thee in the Ship.</P>
<P>And now you see the best Way that is open to you, to help at a Pinch, to save the poor distressed Churches of God in this Time of their Need, such praying as may have its Fruit unto Holiness in your selves; by this you may do much to promote the Holiness and Happiness of the People; if any Thing, this will do it.</P>
<P>Wherefore gird up your Loins, and set in in good earnest upon this seasona∣ble and mighty Duty. Go into your Closets, lift up your Hearts, draw forth your Souls, pour out your Tears, weep in your Prayer, weep over your own and the Peoples Sins and Fears, and bow your selves with your might before the Lord; this once try what you can do, try the Strength of Prayer. Pray all to rights within you and at home, and then seek and cry, and wrestle, and trust,
<PB N="23" REF="006452_0025_1028F90332CDF370"/>and wait for the Salvation of God to be revealed in due Time upon his People.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX from Dr. <HI>Increase Mather's</HI> Discourse on the Preva∣lency of Prayer.</HEAD>
<P>IT was a great Word which <HI>Luther</HI> spoke, when he said, '<HI>There is a Kind of Omnipotency</HI> in Preyer.— Where do we find in all the Book of God a more wonderful Expression, than that of the Lord to praying <HI>Meses, Now let me alone?</HI>— Prayer is stronger than Iron Gates.

<P>I knew one, the Son of an holy, and eminently faithful Minister, who in some of the Days of his Youth, had been wild and vain, but was (through the Grace of Christ) converted in his young Years, and after his Father's Death, perusing his private Papers, he perceived, that not many Days before he was in the Pangs of the new Birth, his Father had been by secret Fasting and Prayer seeking un∣to the Lord that converting sanctifying Grace might be bestowed upon that Son of his.</P>
