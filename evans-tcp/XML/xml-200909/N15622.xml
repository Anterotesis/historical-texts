<HEAD>CHAP. I. ON BAPTISM.</HEAD>
<P>JOHN the Baptist was sent as a voice crying in the wilderness, to proclaim the approach of the Messiah; to point him out, upon his personal appearance, to the people; to preach the necessity of repentance for the remission of sins; and to baptize with water, as prefiguring the spiritual administration of the Saviour under the dispensation of the gospel, in baptizing with the Holy Ghost, to the purification of souls, and fitting them for an eternal inheritance with the saints in light.</P>
<P>John came not to institute, but to precede and prepare the way for, this glorious dispensation; he therefore represented the new covenant of the Prince of life and peace, under the title of <HI>the kingdom of heaven,</HI> which he declared to be <HI>at hand,</HI> or near to take place.</P>
<P>This gospel-establishment the prophet Jeremiah had foretold, should<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jer. xxi. 32.</NOTE> <HI>not be according to the old covenant</HI> of symbolical forms and shadows, which the inspired author of the epistle to the Hebrews
<PB N="4" REF="019924_0003_0FE1A344B5A21658"/>observed,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 9, 10.</NOTE> <Q>could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;</Q> because it <Q>stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of reformation.</Q></P>
<P>John's baptism, being of the same exterior nature with the rituals of the law, could no more add towards the purification of the heart, and the perfection of a good conscience, than they: like them, it was <HI>a figure for the time then present,</HI> to shadow forth the internal effect of the Lord's bap∣tism, but no further requisite thereunto. John knowing this, when Jesus came to partake of his baptism, as he likewise did of the ordinances of the law (not that he might give a sanction to their continuance, but that he might <HI>fulfil</HI> them, as having been primarily of divine authority, and not yet disannulled) appeared surprized that he whom he knew to be the inward and effectual baptizer, should apply to him for his outward baptism, saying,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Mat. iii. 14, 15.</NOTE> <Q>I have need to be baptized of thee, and comest thou to me?</Q> but upon our Lord's ans∣wering, "Suffer it to be so <HI>now,</HI>" (which intimated his own spiritual baptism was not yet to commence, so as to put a final period to that of John) he admitted it; and soon after directed his hearers to him, saying,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">John i. 29.</NOTE> <Q>Behold the Lamb of God, Which <HI>taketh away the sin of the world.</HI></Q></P>
<P>For this gracious end, the Son of God resigned himself up to become<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">I Tim. ii. 6.</NOTE> <HI>a ransom for all mankind, to be testified,</HI> or outwardly verified, <HI>in due time,</HI> by which he shewed the love of God to fallen man, and his willingness to pardon sinners upon their repentance; in order to which, he <Q><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Psalm lxviii. 18.</NOTE> received gifts for men; yea for the rebellious also, that the
<PB N="5" REF="019924_0004_0FE1A34637AA4268"/>Lord God might dwell among them.</Q> Hence<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">I Cor. xii. 7.</NOTE> <Q>the manifestation of the spirit is given to <HI>every man,</HI> to prosit withal;</Q> that on their embracing it, in faith and obedience, the might, by its baptizing power and virtue, be delivered from the condem∣nation due for sins committed, and be cleansed from all unrighteousness.</P>
<P>To this import are the following expressions of John;<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mat. iii. 11, 12.</NOTE> <Q>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance; but he that cometh after me (or whose ministration shall succeed mine) is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to bear, he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and with fire; whose fan is in his Hand, and he will thoroughly purge his floor, and gather his wheat into his garner; but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.</Q> John here shews the true distinction betwixt his own baptism, and that of our Saviour: the first with water; the last with the Holy Ghost; and also metaphorically inculcates, that the baptism of Christ should winnow the soul of its chaffy, or sinful nature, and operate as fire, to the perfect consumption of all its defilement.</P>
<P><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">John iii. 30.</NOTE> <Q>He must increase, said John, but I must decrease.</Q> This indicates, that as the spiritual ministration of Christ should advance, John's watery one should recede; not be joined with it. Neither was the regenerating baptism of the spirit consequent upon it when administered; for the<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Acts viii.</NOTE> Samaritans received the Holy Ghost some time <HI>after</HI> their water baptism;<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 47.</NOTE> Cornelius and his friends received it <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</HI> and<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Acts viii.</NOTE> Simon the sorcerer received it <HI>not at all,</HI> though he was baptized with water.</P>
<P>Spirit-baptism, therefore, is not connected with water-baptism, nor at all dependant upon it. The
<PB N="6" REF="019924_0005_0FE1A357710940D0"/>baptism of the Saviour is complete in itself, without exterior form and shadow. By its renewed impres∣sions on the believing and attentive soul, the new∣birth of the spirit is brought forth therein, and in proportion to its growth and increase, the old man, with his corrupt deeds, becomes crucified, and the soul delivered, and raised up into newness of life.</P>
<P>This is the baptism which is essential to salvation, as our Lord gave Nicodemus to understand, when he said,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">John iii.</NOTE> <Q>Except a Man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</Q> And again, <Q>Except a man be born of water and of the spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</Q> The word <HI>water</HI> here, like that of <HI>fire,</HI> Mat. iii. 12. is used to signify the purifying virtue of the spirit in the regeneration of the soul.</P>
<P><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Liberty of Prophesying, page 231.</NOTE> Bishop Taylor saith, <Q>The water and the spirit in this place signify the same thing; and by water is meant the effect of the spirit cleansing and puri∣fying the soul, as appears in its parallel of Christ baptizing with the spirit and fire.</Q></P>
<P>That our Lord meant it of the spirit only, suffici∣ently appears from his own explanatory expression, verse 6. <Q>That which is born of the flesh, is flesh; and that which is born of the spirit, is spirit.</Q></P>
<P>Those who advocate the continuance of water∣baptism, plead our Saviour's commission, Mathew xxviii. 19. but he there makes no mention of water, nor do his words imply it; for his expressions are such as suit only with his own spiritual baptism. Neither did his Disciples from thence begin the practice of water-baptisin. They had taken it up some time before, most probably from John's exam∣ple, whom they justly venerated as a messenger sent from God, and in great estimation with their Lord
<PB N="7" REF="019924_0006_0FE1A43E7417C120"/>and master; for they administered it after the same manner he did, and so continued to do, when they used it after our Lord's ascension, as well as before. Whereas, if they had understood his command to intend water-baptism, they would certainly have altered their terms, and have administered it in the very words of his commission, which we do not find in holy writ they ever did. It was therefore still John's baptism in nature, and far below the effectual baptism of the great Messiah; who, notwithstanding he bore such honourable testimony concering John, as a burning and shining light, and one of the greatest prophets born of woman, as being his immediate forerunner, yet, at the same time he said,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Luke vii. 23.</NOTE> <Q>He that is least in the kingdom of God, is greater than he.</Q> This implies that the lowest attainment in the spiritual dispensation of Christ, is superior in nature to the highest in John's ministra∣tion: this being but the temporary sign, and that the substantial and permanent reality signified by it.</P>
<P>Let us now consider what the commission was, and to whom it was given. It appears to have been merely verbal; for we find it was not immediately attended with the authority requisite to its execution. The qualification still necessary was the inspiration of the Holy Ghost, which the disciples were to receive afterwards; without which they were not to enter upon the work of the ministry, but to wait in patience for its illuminating and powerful virtue, to put them forth, and to abilitate them for the service.<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Luke xxiv. 49.</NOTE> "Behold," said the great Minister of the sanctuary, <Q>I send the promise of my Father upon you; but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye be endued with power from on high. <NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Acts i. 5.</NOTE> John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be
<PB N="8" REF="019924_0007_0FE1A43FF8C95E68"/>baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence."—<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid v. 8.</NOTE> "Ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you, and ye shall be witnesses unto me, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the utter∣most part of the earth.</Q></P>
<P>Thus was the spiritual baptism of Christ, which had been predicted by John, to commence, and those who ministered, were to <HI>teach baptizing</HI> into the same spirit themselves were baptized with. Unless the ministers were baptized with the spirit, they could not baptize their believing hearers with it; nor could their hearers without faith receive it.</P>
<P>This appears to be the baptism intended in the commission; for it relates not to the baptism of John, but to that of Christ, and holds forth <HI>the preaching of the gospel in the spirit and power of God.</HI> Therefore the commission was given to those in the primitive age, who were divinely inspired for that purpose, and it unquestionably reaches to all influenced by THE SAME SPIRIT, and to such only, to the end of the world.</P>
<P>The words of the commission are,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Mat. xxviii. 19.</NOTE> <Q>Go ye, and teach all nations, baptizing them, <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/> <HI>into the name</HI> of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.</Q> The word <HI>name</HI> here is not to be understood literally, but of that divine power, virtue, and heavenly influence, which em∣phatically denotes and characterizes the Godhead above all other beings; which our Lord often expressed by the same word. John xvii. 6. <Q>I have manifested thy <HI>name</HI> unto the men thou gavest me;" ver. 12. "I kept them in thy <HI>name;"</HI> and verse 11. he prayed, "Holy Father, keep through thine own <HI>name,</HI> those thou hast given
<PB N="9" REF="019924_0008_0FE1A447C251C3E8"/>me!</Q> In this name is strength and salvation.<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Prov. xviii. 10.</NOTE> <Q>The name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous runneth into it, and is safe.</Q> The knowledge of it gives faith,<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Psalm ix. 10.</NOTE> <Q>They that know thy name will put their trust in thee.</Q> It is the consolating unction from the Holy One.<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Cant. i. 3.</NOTE> <Q>Thy name is as ointment poured forth; therefore do the virgins (the chaste in heart) love thee.</Q> Into the internal virtue and influence of this sacred and all-sufficient name, or spirit, are all the truly rege∣nerate measurably baptized; for,<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 9.</NOTE> <Q>If any man have not the spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</Q></P>
<P>The apostles, with many of the primitive brethren, received this <HI>baptism into the name,</HI> or spirit, of the Godhead to a high degree, which enabled them to <HI>teach baptizing</HI> with such efficacy, that multitudes<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Aris ii. 37.</NOTE> were <HI>pricked in their heart,</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Acts iv. 33.</NOTE> <Q>and with <HI>great power</HI> gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus,</Q> so that even<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid vi. 10.</NOTE> their enemies were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit by which they spake.</P>
<P>Peter relating the result of his visit to Cornelius, and his company, about eight years after the great effusion of the Holy Ghost at the time of Pente∣cost, thus testifies to its baptizing power in the true ministry of the word:<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid xi. 15. 16.</NOTE> <Q>As I began to speak, the Holy Ghost fell on them, as on us in the begin∣ning. Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost.</Q> This plainly shews, that the spiritual baptism of Christ accompanied their preach∣ing, and therefore was the baptism intended in his commission. The same apostle also witnesses more
<PB N="10" REF="019924_0009_0FE1A4494ABD5038"/>generally,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Peter i. 12.</NOTE> that the gospel was preached <HI>with the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven.</HI></P>
<P>Some object, that it is not in the power of men, but of God only, to baptize with the Holy Ghost. But let such consider, that he is pleased to work instrumentally, as well as immediately; and though, in a common way of expression, we may say, the ministers of Christ baptize with the spirit of Christ; it is no more meant that they can do it in their own wills, or by their own powers, than it was so intended of the primitive ministers, who are said to work miracles. To the Lord alone is the power and glory of all to be attributed. He is the sole effector of all good, and the best of men are but his instruments when he is pleased to make use of them; yet by a metonymy of the instrument for the power that useth it, it is usual to say, such a person instantly made the cripple to walk, healed the diseased, or conferred the Holy Ghost, without any intention to attribute that to man which is only due to God.</P>
<P><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">John xv. 5.</NOTE> "Without me," said our Lord to his disciples "ye can do nothing." But when he had endued them with the spirit,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Gal. iii. 5.</NOTE> <HI>they ministered the spirit,</HI> as well as the doctrines of Christianity; for true gospel ministry is not that of words only, but of <HI>words with power.</HI> Therefore the true minister of the gospel always baptizeth, more or less, in his ministry according to the measure of divine influence upon him; who without it would be only as salt without savour, however he might be furnished with scho∣lastic argument and human eloquence. These may entertain the head, and move the passions, which is not the business of an inspired minister; but <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> subject them, and to instruct, and quicken the soul into an inward sense of the effective power and virtue
<PB N="11" REF="019924_0010_0FE1A44AD046E2A8"/>of the divine life.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Cor. ii. 4, 5.</NOTE> <Q>My speech, and my preach∣ing" said Paul, though a learned person, was not with enticing words of man's wisdom, but <HI>in demonstration of the spirit, and of power;</HI> that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but <HI>in the power of God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Our Lord constantly gave his followers an exam∣ple of this <HI>baptismal teaching</HI> in his own practice; which induced his hearers to confess, that he taught<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Mat. vii. 29</NOTE> <HI>with authority,</HI> and not as the scribes. They were astonished at his doctrine; for<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Luke iv. 32.</NOTE> his word was <HI>with power.</HI> The scribes had human authority, but his was divine; which so struck even the officers sent by the chief priests and pharisees to take him, that they excused themselves by saying,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">John vii. 46.</NOTE> <Q>Never man spake like this man.</Q> This was unques∣tionably true; for if any other spoke the same words, none could enforce them with the same fulness of divine power and authority. Thus he led the way to what he afterwards commissioned and empowered his disciples to do, in the measure he afforded them respectively.</P>
<P>The Apostle Paul undoubtedly had an equal share in the gospel commission with any other inspired minister, and was equally bound to baptize in the sense intended therein; but, with water, he declared<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Cor. i. 17.</NOTE> <HI>he was not sent to baptize:</HI> consequently, water-baptism was not the baptism enjoined in the commission. But, he asserts, he was sent <HI>to preach <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> gospel,</HI> which is the special matter of that com∣mission, that is, to <HI>teach, baptizing</HI> into the life and power of the Holy Spirit that qualified him for it. Accordingly he reminds the believers,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">1 Thes. i. 5.</NOTE> <Q>Our gospel came not unto you in word only, but also <HI>in power, and in the Holy Ghost,</HI> and in much
<PB N="12" REF="019924_0011_0FE1A44CE67E1488"/>assurance." He also shews the effect it had on them,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Thes. ii. 13.</NOTE> "When ye received the word of God which ye heard of us, ye received it not as the word of men; but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which effectually worketh also <HI>in you that believe.</HI></Q> Hence we may observe this distinction, that the preaching of the gospel by immediate inspiration, is to be received as the word of God; but preaching concerning it without inspiration, is only to be esteemed as the word of man.</P>
<P>Many have been trained up to believe, that our Saviour made water-baptisn the condition of our admittance into his kingdom. Were it so, the sal∣vation of all mankind depends upon it; and if the sprinkling or dipping of infants be, either the sav∣ing baptism, or the sole means through which it is to be received, the salvation of the child who dies before it attains to years of understanding, or power of choice, depends upon the precarious conduct of its parents, or that of others, without any will, knowledge, or default of its own.</P>
<P>But what rational and considerate person can believe, that the just Creator, and kind Saviour of mankind, is so void of equity and commiseration, as to suffer those innocents who die in their infancy, to fall into everlasting misery, for the want of a ceremonial, which, if it be a duty, cannot be theirs, but that of their parents, or of those who have the care of their concerns upon them, and whose omis∣sion must be their fault, if it be any, and not that of the children, who can be no way chargeable with it? The solemn denunciation of the great God, who affords of his<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Tit. ii. 11.</NOTE> <HI>saving grace unto all men,</HI> is,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xviii. 20</NOTE> <Q>The soul <HI>that sinneth,</HI> it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father;
<PB N="13" REF="019924_0012_0FE1A4556776FB48"/>neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son. The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him.</Q></P>
<P>The tender infant hath neither ability to receive a law, nor to transgress it, therefore it cannot be guilty of the commission of sin; and to hold it guilty, because its primogenitors transgressed long before it existed, and that it is justly punishable merely for descending from them in the state of their fallen nature, which it could not avoid, is too barbarous for truth and righteousness to warrant. Yet this cruel notion, the production of error and bigotry, hath been zealously espoused and propagated.</P>
<P><HI>Fidus,</HI> an <HI>African</HI> bishop in the third century, advised the baptism of infants for the purgation of original sin, alledging that the Jews circumcised theirs. This at first seemed new and strange to <HI>Cyprian;</HI> but he afterwards fell in with a collection of 66 bishops and presbyters, who enjoined it. The practice became preached up afterwards by divers <HI>as necessary;</HI> and the <HI>Milevitan</HI> and <HI>Carthagenian</HI> coun∣cils, in the fore part of the fifth century, went so far as to fix an <HI>anathema</HI> upon all who held that young children might be saved without water-bap∣tism; which was ratified by several succeeding popes. <HI>Augustine</HI> carried the matter still further, teaching that even embryos, if they had been quickened in the mother's womb, and there died unbaptized, were damned, as guilty of original sin. This put the <HI>wisdom</HI> of the priesthood upon contriving a remedy: some they took up out of their graves, and <HI>christened,</HI> as they superstitiously called it, the dead body: others they baptized by <HI>proxy,</HI> in imitation of those early misled professors among the <HI>Corinthi∣ans,</HI> who also doubted of the resurrection; in proof of which, the apostle doubly argued with them;
<PB N="14" REF="019924_0013_0FE1A4571FED9198"/>First, from their own practice, who, from a notion of the necessity of water-baptism unto salvation, took upon them to be baptized for those who died without it:<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xv. 29, 30.</NOTE> <Q>What shall they do," said he, who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?</Q> The manner of this baptism was thus; one of them placed himself under the bed of the deceased, who being asked if he would be baptized; the party under his bed answered for him in the affirmative, and then was baptized in his stead; which <HI>Godwin,</HI> properly enough, compares to the acting of a play upon the stage.</P>
<P>Secondly, The apostle reasons from his own exer∣cise, and that of his concerned brethren; <Q>Why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</Q> The import of which seems to be, why are we continually bap∣tized in affliction, suffering, and danger, for the sake of those who are dead in trespasses and sins, that they may be quickened by the spirit of life in Christ Jesus, if none are to be so quickened, and if there shall be no resurrection hereafter?</P>
<P>As the followers of Jacobus Cyrus took the word <HI>water,</HI> John iii. 5. in the literal sense, so they did the word <HI>fire,</HI> Mat. iii. 11. and thence branded their children, either in the face, or upon the arm, with a heated iron in the form of a cross. But this having something of cruelty, as well as absurdity in it, did not so generally obtain as water-sprinkling; in the ministration of which, the Romish church teemed abundantly with modes and fancies of ima∣ginary significance.</P>
<P>The self-flattering notion, that the new-birth of the spirit is either concurrent with, or consequent upon, the ministration of water-baptism, is neither
<PB N="15" REF="019924_0014_0FE1A458A7D7A560"/>supported by scripture nor experience. If it insen∣sibly accompany it, how do we know it? If it im∣mediately follow, how do its fruits appear more in those who have received water-baptism, than in those who have not?<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 22.<GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></NOTE> "The fruit of the spirit," saith the apostle, <Q>is love, joy, peace, long-suffer∣ing, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, tem∣perance."—<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Eph. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE>"The fruit of the spirit is in all goodness, and righteousness, and truth.</Q> Are these fruits more conspicuous in the baptized, than in the unbaptized? If those who are baptized with water are born of the spirit, and made heirs of the kingdom of heaven, how comes it that such as have received it, either in adult age or infancy, and become afterwards awakened to a sense of their condition, are still conscious of a body of sin remaining within them, and are made to cry out in anxiety of soul, A Saviour, or I die! A Redeemer, or I perish for ever! Are not such painfully sensible, that they still want remission and regeneration, notwithstanding their water-baptism?</P>
<P>If any say, This may arise from sins committed after their baptism. I answer, the apostle John saith,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> <Q>Whosoever is born of God, doth not commit sin; for his seed remaineth in him, and he <HI>cannot sin,</HI> because he is born of God.</Q> But it is evi∣dent in fact, that he who is baptized only with water, <HI>can sin</HI> as freely and fully as he who is not; therefore he who is baptized with water, is not in consequence born of God.</P>
<P>It is pleaded, that <HI>Peter commanded water-bap∣tism,</HI> Acts x. 48. <HI>which he certainly would not have done, had he not held the practice necessary.</HI> On the same foundation it may be argued, that he would not have<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> ii. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> <HI>compelled</HI> the believing Gentiles to live
<PB N="16" REF="019924_0015_0FE1A45A2A607ED8"/>after the manner of the Jewish law, had he not held it necessary; yet we find Paul openly reproved him for it. This shews, that Peter, though one of the most eminent apostles, in the early time of the gospel, sometimes went a little too far, in com∣pliance with the prejudices of his Jewish brethren, divers of whom were present when he commanded those Gentile convert, to be baptized. But in this particular instance at the house of Cornelius, Peter might not be blameable; for we have reason to believe, that such a prudential tenderness both to∣wards Jews and Gentiles, was permitted for a sea∣son, as to allow the practice of divers rituals, till their attachment to them should become lessened, by the prevalence of the Holy spirit in their hearts.</P>
<P>Upon this ground he probably exhorted the peo∣ple, Acts ii. 38, 39. <Q>Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For <HI>the promise</HI> is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off.</Q></P>
<P>This <HI>general promise</HI> he had thus cited from Joel in the beginning of his discourse: <NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> <Q>It shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams: and on my servants, and on my hand∣maidens, I will pour out in those days of my spirit, and they shall prophesy.</Q></P>
<P>This dispensation of the spirit to both sexes, then eminently took place, and the apostle, undoubtedly, expressed himself in the words before-cited, with allusion to the spiritual baptism of Christ, which
<PB N="17" REF="019924_0016_0FE1A46254FAE150"/>operates to true repentance, and brings to experience that conversion of heart, which is followed by the remission of sins, and the reception of the Holy Ghost. This he plainly taught in a parallel passage of the following chapter:<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> <Q>Repent ye therefore, and <HI>be converted,</HI> that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord.</Q></P>
<P>These renovating and consolatory effects follow not in consequence of the ministration of water-baptism; for if they did, Simon the sorcerer, and all the wicked amongst men that ever received it, would have had remission, and the gift of the Holy Ghost.</P>
<P>We find the apostle Paul also conformed at times in this, and divers other ceremonials; but when he afterwards perceived hurt already had, and was likely still to ensue from such conformity, he forbore it; and<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> thanked God that he had only baptized <HI>Crispus, Gaius,</HI> and the houshold of <HI>Stephanas;</HI> declaring, that Christ <HI>sent him not to baptize,</HI> (that is, with water) but <HI>to preach the Gospel.</HI></P>
<P>Peter himself also afterwards, probably observing a danger of water-baptism being received and espoused as the real baptism of the Gospel, guards the believ∣ers against such a dangerous mistake,<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> by shewing what the true christian baptism is; to wit, that it is not that which puts away the filth of the flesh, but that which produceth the answer of a good consci∣ence towards God. Thus it is not the figurative, but the effective baptism pointed to by the figure, the refining baptism of the Holy Ghost that saveth.</P>
<P>It is well known by the experience of many, that this baptism is gradually effected by spiritual immersions of the soul, according to the measure of corruption it hath imbibed, and to the strictness or
<PB N="18" REF="019924_0017_0FE1A46436C2C898"/>laxity of its attention to the great Baptizer. A sense of its sinful condition, with the distance it stands at from the God of perfect purity, is first given it, whereby it is brought into self-abasement, contrition, and, at length, into humble resignation of all to him. Thus it becomes baptized into the similitude of the death of Christ, which is a death unto all that is of a carnal and sensual nature. Through baptism it also riseth with him into newness of life, which enableth it to bring sorth the fruits of the spirit to his praise. To those who had thus followed Christ in the regeneration, the apostle said,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 10 &amp;c.</NOTE> <Q>Ye are com∣plete in him, who is the head of all principality and power. In whom also ye are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ; <HI>buried with him in baptism, wherein ye are also risen with him, through the faith of the operation of God.</HI></Q></P>
<P>True Christian baptism is a great and important work; the work of Christ himself whereby the soul is measurably baptized into his spirit, and endowed with its virtues. This is quite another thing than a ceremonious formalization under his name. The latter is easy to the flesh, but the former crucifies it.<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 24.</NOTE> <Q>They that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts."—<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid iii. 27.</NOTE> As many of you," said Paul, "as have been baptized into Christ, have <HI>put on Christ.</HI></Q> To take the name Christian upon us, and to be joined to the pro∣miscuous body of a prosessing church, is only to put on a profession of Christ; but to have really <HI>put him on,</HI> is to be endued in degree with his Holy Spirit and nature; which those, who have been <HI>baptized into him,</HI> certainly are. For,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Cor. v. 17. 18.</NOTE> <Q>if any
<PB N="19" REF="019924_0018_0FE1A465BA161630"/>man be <HI>in Christ, he is a new creature:</HI> old things are passed away, behold all things are become new, and all things are of God.</Q> Such are become inwardly united to Christ, grafted as branches in him the living vine, daily partaking of his life and virtue, which renders them fruitful according to their measure; to these he pressingly shews the necessity of care and watchfulness, that they may abide in him:<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">John xv. 4, 5, 6.</NOTE> "As the branch," said he, <Q>cannot bear fruit of itself, (or) except it abide in the vine; no more can ye, except <HI>ye abide</HI> in me. I am the vine, ye are the branches. He that abideth <HI>in me,</HI> and <HI>I in him,</HI> the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing. If a man <HI>abide not in me,</HI> he is cast forth as a branch, and is withered.</Q> This manifests that maxim, <HI>once in grace, and always in grace,</HI> to be no better than a broken reed, and dangerous for any who have been sensible of a divine visitation to rest their salvation upon.</P>
<P>It is improper to imagine, that the sign of cir∣cumcision, given to Abraham and his descendants, was a type of water-baptism, which was only an outward and typical sign itself. Ceremony and substance are type and antitype; not ceremony and ceremony. What the circumcision of the foreskin pointed to, was the inward circumcision of the fleshly heart, called for by Moses, Deut. x. 16. and promised, chap. xxx. 6. Water-baptism in like manner typified<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Tit. iii. 5.</NOTE> <HI>the washing of regeneration;</HI> which is effected by <HI>the renewing of the Holy Ghost.</HI></P>
<P>Mark xvi. 16. "He that <HI>believeth,</HI> and is <HI>bap∣tized,</HI> shall be saved." This must be understood of that <HI>saving faith,</HI> which worketh by love, to the purification of the heart, and of that <HI>saving baptism,</HI> which operates to the answer of a good conscience.
<PB N="20" REF="019924_0019_0FE1A467DBB10510"/>If we do not believe unto obedience, if we have not that faith which overcomes the world in our hearts, we shall not be found in the faith once delivered to the saints; and, if we are not<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">John iii. 8.</NOTE> washed by the Lord himself, whoever else may baptize us, we have no part in him. Simon Magus <HI>believed, and was bap∣tized with water,</HI> yet remained so far from a state of salvation, that when he offered money for the Holy Ghost, the inspired apostle sharply answered him,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Acts viii. 13, 21, 23.</NOTE> <Q>Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.— I perceive thou art in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity.</Q> What therefore had his bare believing and water-baptism done for him?</P>
<P>Misapprehension at first, and tradition afterwards, having inculcated water-baptism as a permanent institution of our Lord's, and an indispensable part of the gospel-ministration, some of its advocates have weakly argued for it as such, from his washing<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">John xiii.</NOTE> the feet of his disciples, and directing it as their duty to do the like to each other. But this instance had no relation to that ceremony; for our Lord was not then instructing his followers how to initiate new converts, but figuratively shewing them what their own conduct should be amongst themselves, by setting them a pattern of humility, condescension, and brotherly kindness one to another. This un¦doubtedly was his intent; not the establishment of the exterior act of pedal ablution.</P>
<P>Water-baptism being an essential part of John's commission, he properly admitted his disciples by it; which the great Administrator of spiritual baptism <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> not. When he called to any, <HI>Follow me,</HI> those, who obeyed his call, immediately became his disci∣ples, without any ceremonial. We find he accepted
<PB N="21" REF="019924_0020_0FE1A46D6EDEFE30"/>Peter, Andrew, John, James, Levi, Philip, Natha∣niel, and Zacheus, without either baptizing them, or directing them to be baptized with water. As it was then, so it remains to be; those who are obedient to his call are his followers, whether they are water-baptized, or not. On the contrary, those who obey not the internal manifestations of his spirit, are none of his, whoever baptizeth them with water. Formality may render any man a nominal Christian; but the effectual baptism of the spirit only can make a real one.</P>
<P>The practice of sprinkling infants under the name of baptism, hath neither precept nor precedent in the New Testament. For want of real instances, <HI>mere suppositions</HI> are offered in support of it. Because it is said in the case of <HI>Lydia,</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Acts xvi. 15.</NOTE> that she was baptized, and her <HI>houshold;</HI> and by the apostle, "I baptized also the houshold of <HI>Stephanas;</HI>" it is <HI>supposed,</HI> there might be infants, or little children, in those housholds; from whence it is inferred such were baptized. But could such improbabilities be ever so well ascertained, they would fall very short of proving the practice <HI>a divine and perpetual institution.</HI></P>
<P>The words of our Saviour,<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Mark x. 13.</NOTE> <Q>Suffer the little children to come unto me,</Q> afford no ground for infant-baptism. He made no mention of it, much less did he recommend it as requisite to prepare them for his kingdom; for he declared their fitness already: "Forbid them not," said he, <Q>for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</Q> Who are they that presume to <HI>forbid</HI> such as unqualified to enter it, unless they are sprinkled by their hands? The intention of our Lord in admitting the children to him, appears to have been, that he might exhibit them as examples of innocence and fitness to those actual sinners about
<PB N="22" REF="019924_0021_0FE1A46F9157E930"/>him; to whom he said, <Q>Verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein.</Q> Had he meant to adopt and establish paedo-baptism as a standing ordinance, a fairer opportunity could hardly offer, either to baptize the children himself, or command his disciples to do it; neither of which he did; but graciously shewed his acceptance of them without it, for <Q>he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them.</Q></P>
<P>We never find either the Lord Jesus, or his apostles, preaching up water-baptism as <HI>his,</HI> nor telling the people they cannot be his followers without it. His conditions of discipleship are not so easy to the carnal mind.<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Luke ix. 27.</NOTE> <Q>If any man will come after me,</Q> said he, <Q>let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.</Q>—<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ibid xiv. 27.</NOTE> <Q>Whosoever doth not bear his cross, and come after me, <HI>cannot be my disciple.</HI></Q> Hence it is clear, that it is not water-baptism, nor any kind of rituals whatsoever, which renders any man a Chris∣tian in our Saviour's account; but obedience to the operation of his Holy Spirit, which humbleth the heart, purifieth the soul, and baptizeth it measurably into the divine nature. But mortification of self being irksome, and highly disagreeable to the flesh too many are rather willing to content themselves with assuming the name Christian under the outward sign, than to endure the pain of crossing their carnal propensities, in order <HI>to put on Christ,</HI> and become Christians indeed. But let such attentively consider this salutary admonition of the apostle.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Gal. vi. 7, 8.</NOTE> <Q>Be not deceived; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap. For he that
<PB N="23" REF="019924_0022_0FE1A47118B22C90"/>soweth to his flesh, shall of the flesh reap corrup∣tion; but he that soweth to the spirit, shall of the spirit reap life everlasting.</Q></P>
<P>The command, <Q>Go teach all nations, baptiz∣ing,</Q> &amp;c. shews that the baptism therein meant, should be as general as the preaching there intended, both among Jews and Gentiles; which water∣baptism evidently was not. For Paul, who was sent chiefly to the Gentiles, was very sparing in the use of it, and thanked God that he had baptized but two or three families with it, declaring that <HI>was not his commission;</HI> yet he planted many churches, which contained numbers who received the spirit, and walked in the faith and fellowship of the gospel, and who were <HI>as real Christians</HI> without water-baptism, as others were with it. This shews, that it was neither made an essential, nor an integral part of Christianity; and consequently, that the conti∣nuance of it was but an occasional condescension; for it having been an ancient custom both among Jews and Gentiles, to initiate their proselytes by it, and also administered by John under divine authority, and taken up from him by the disciples of our Lord, it was become a ceremony of considerable account with the generality, who saw not sufficiently into the purity and simplicity of the Gospel: therefore it could not, even after the baptism of Christ by the Holy Ghost appeared, be every where laid aside suddenly; neither was it required so to be, but, as John intimated, to <HI>decrease,</HI> or fall into disuse by degrees. In like manner the apostles also occasionally complied with the rites of the Mosaic law in various particulars; as circumcision, vows, shavings, exterior purifications, sacrifices, anointings, &amp;c. all which were permitted for a season; yet, had the professors of Christianity abode in the spirit of it, and sincerely sought a growth therein, ceremonials of all kinds
<PB N="24" REF="019924_0023_0FE1A47341583148"/>would soon have been extinct in the church. But instead of growing in grace, and in the saving know∣ledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, a falling away began early to take place, and in proportion as the life of religion dwindled, forms and shadows were more and more fastened upon, and gradually increased upon the declining state of the church, as the spirit of antichrist gained ground. But to return.</P>
<P>We read, Eph. v. 25, 26. <Q>Christ also loved the Church, and gave himself for it, that <HI>he</HI> might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word; that he might present it to himself <HI>a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing;</HI> but that it should be <HI>holy and without blemish.</HI></Q> This is the work of Christ himself, and therefore is done by his own spiritual baptism. <HI>The water of the word</HI> signifies its cleansing power, as<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">1 Peter ii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>the milk of the word</HI> denotes its nutri∣mental virtue; and this sanctifying <HI>word</HI> is the issuing forth of the spirit of Christ for great and gracious purposes, who is himself the emphatical and all powerful <HI>Word,</HI> through whom the Father effects his will, and communicates all things to his people. By him alone the church can be rendered <HI>holy, and presented without blemish.</HI></P>
<P>According to apostolic doctrine, there is but <HI>one baptism</HI> now remaining in force:<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Eph. iv. 5.</NOTE> <Q>One Lord, one faith, one baptism.</Q> And as the Christian dispensation is that of Christ, the one baptism must be the baptism of Christ; which is not by water, but the Holy Ghost:<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xii. 13.</NOTE> "For," saith Paul, <Q>by one spirit are we all baptized into one body.</Q> By receiving the same spirit, we become of the same spiritual body. The outward and visible sign may introduce us into membership with such an outward
<PB N="25" REF="019924_0024_0FE1A47CC426B2C8"/>and visible church as holds with the retention of the sign; but it is the effectual operation of the spirit of Christ in us, that renders us members of his body, or true spiritual church.</P>
<P>The distinction betwixt our Saviour's baptism, and that of John, lies not in the same elementary ministration after a different mode, or under another form of words.<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/></NOTE> <Q>I, (saith John) indeed have baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost.</Q> This plainly shews, that the baptism of Christ, and that of John, were two separate baptisms, and that they are perfectly distinct, and different from each other, as type and antitype.</P>
<P>Some have argued, that <HI>as the soul is not properly a man without the body, nor the body without the soul, but both in conjunction make the man; so water-baptism and spirit-baptism are both requisite to make up the one Christian baptism.</HI> But though soul and body be the two constituent parts of a man, the two baptisms have no such constitutional connection. That of the spirit, being the effective reality, is complete in itself; but that of water was only a temporary figure, and no more a part of the baptism of Christ, than the circumcision of the foreskin was a part of the circumcision of the heart.</P>
<P>The transaction of Philip with the Ethiopian eunuch, Acts viii. hath been treated as if meant to give a miraculous sanction to water-baptism. But it is evident, this great and well-disposed man had been at, Jerusalem with a pious intention to worship the true God, who knowing the sincerity of his heart, sent Philip to instruct him, and to preach his Son Jesus to him, as the Saviour of mankind. After he had so done, as they passed near a certain
<PB N="26" REF="019924_0025_0FE1A47E9C4438A8"/>water, the eunuch judging, according to the custom of both Jews and Gentiles, that he must be entered as a proselyte by the usual ceremony, made a motion to Philip that he might be there baptized. And, as the apostles, in this early time of the gospel, saw fit occasionally to condescend to this and various other rituals, Philip went into the water with him, and baptized him. But, if any miracle was wrought, the text affords no testimony that it was done to give a sanction to water-baptism, nor that it is a perpetual institution of our Lord. It doth not appear in the New Testament, that he ever insti∣tuted, adopted, or once administered water-baptism himself. The evangelist declares, that<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">John iv. 2.</NOTE> <Q>Jesus himself baptized not:</Q> that is, not with water; and undoubtedly for this reason, because <HI>it was not his baptism,</HI> but John's, who was the only person we find divinely commissioned for it. Our Lord's submitting himself to it, under John's ministration, was upon the same footing that he submitted to the Jewish ceremonials. They had all been divinely commanded, and in acknowledgment of them as such, he countenanced the practice of them, till the period of their obligation should arrive, by the establishment of his own spiritual dispensation.</P>
<P>No one outwardly-connected body upon earth, hath a right to engross to itself the title of <HI>the true church,</HI> and thence to assert, there is no salvation but within its own peculiar pale; for all professing churches are composed, more or less, of a promis∣cuous number of those who love and fear God, and of those who regard him not with that reverence and subjection all ought to do. Those who walk most in the spirit, will undoubtedly be most in his favour; but without obedience thereunto, none can
<PB N="27" REF="019924_0026_0FE1A480201BC1D0"/>be so;<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 14.</NOTE> <Q>For, as many as are led by the spirit of God, they are the sons of God:</Q> and,<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Ibid 9.</NOTE> <Q>If any man have not the spirit of Christ (as his leader) he is none of his.</Q> Whatever doctrines he may profess, and whatever forms he may practise, he is no true follower of Christ.<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">John x. 27, 28.</NOTE> <HI>The sheep of Christ hear his voice;</HI> they carefully regard the leadings of his spirit, wherein <HI>he gives unto them eternal life, and none can pluck them out of his hand.</HI> Here is the pale of true salvation; for<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid 16.</NOTE> <HI>there is but one fold under one shepherd.</HI> Of this fold are the righteous under all denominations; for<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Acts x. 34, 35.</NOTE> <Q>God is no respecter of persons; but in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.</Q></P>
<P>Our Lord declared himself to be the <HI>door of entrance</HI> into this fold.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">John x. 7, 9.</NOTE> <Q>Verily, verily, I am the door of the sheep—I am the door, <HI>by me</HI> if any man enter, he shall be saved.</Q> No ceremo∣nial can open this door, much less can it <HI>be</HI> the door. By the communication of faith to the returning sinner, Christ opens the way for him to be purified in heart, and fitted for admission into his church militant here, and the church triumphant hereafter:<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 8.</NOTE> <Q>For by grace are ye saved, through faith, and that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God.</Q></P>
<P>He is also the <HI>means of grace:</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">John i. 17</NOTE> <Q>For the law was given by Moses; but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ.</Q> And it always comes by him; for saith the apostle,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> <Q>Unto every one of us is given grace, according to the measure of the gift of Christ.</Q></P>
<P>The <HI>seal</HI> or <HI>pledge</HI> of the kingdom of heaven, is what entitles to, or insures it. This is the oil of
<PB N="28" REF="019924_0027_0FE1A48256926588"/>divine grace, kept burning and shining in the lamp of the wise virgin soul, or, in other words, the earnest of the spirit in the renewed heart.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. i. 22.</NOTE> <Q>He who establisheth us with you in Christ," saith Paul, "is God, who hath <HI>sealed</HI> us, and given the earnest of the spirit in our hearts."—<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Eph. i. 13.</NOTE> "In whom also after that ye believed, ye were <HI>sealed with that holy spirit of promise.</HI>—<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid iv. 30.</NOTE> "Grieve not the holy spirit of God, <HI>whereby ye are sealed</HI> unto the day of redemption.</Q> The Christian seal, therefore, is the sacred impress of the holy spirit.</P>

<P>Typical forms may be made as doors of entrance into outward and visible churches, and as marks and pledges of fellowship amongst men; but they are not such to the spiritual community of the invisible church of Christ, the members whereof,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">I Peter ii. 5.</NOTE> <Q>as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</Q></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. ON CHRISTIAN COMMUNION.</HEAD>
<P>AS the baptism of Christ is purely spiritual, so is that communion which is truly <HI>the Lord's Jupper.</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Cor. xii. 13.</NOTE> "For," saith holy writ, <Q>by <HI>one spirit</HI> are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been all made <HI>to drink into one spirit.</HI></Q> This indicates, that the communion of real inward Christians, whereby they partake of divine strength and consolation, is <HI>in the one spirit</HI> they are all baptized by.</P>
<P>Undoubtedly, the sign hath been piously used by many, and still may be so by those to whom the termination of it doth not yet appear; but seeing it is not in itself of the spiritual nature of the gospel-dispensation, the necessary question now is, <HI>Whether our Lord instituted it with a declared intention, that the observance of it should be an universal establishment throughout the Christian churches to the end of time?</HI> If this be not ascertained in the affirmative, it cannot, with propriety, be insisted on as an ordinance obli∣gatory upon us at this day. Dean <HI>Stilling fleet</HI> hath justly observed, <Q>Whatsoever is binding upon Christians, and so becomes an article either of faith or practice, <HI>as an universal standing law, must be clearly revealed as such,</HI> and laid down in scripture <HI>in such evident terms,</HI> as that all who have their senses exercised therein, may discern it to have been the will of Christ, that if should perpetually oblige all believers to the end of the world.</Q> Let us a little enquire, whether such clear evidence of the <HI>perpetual obligation</HI> of this ceremonial appears
<PB N="30" REF="019924_0029_0FE1A488E948AA20"/>in the texts that most immediately relate to the subject.</P>
<P>Our Saviour and his disciples being engaged in the celebration of the Jewish passover, the same night he was betrayed, we read,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Matt. xxvi. 26-30.</NOTE> <Q>As they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to his disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink <HI>ye all</HI> of it; for this is my blood of the New Testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.</Q> Luke adds the following expression:<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Luke xxii. 19.</NOTE> "This do in remembrance of me." But the apostle Paul delivers it in a fuller and more explanatory manner.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xi. 25, 26.</NOTE> <Q>This do ye, as oft as ye drink it, in remembrance of me." Adding, For as often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do shew the Lord's death till he come.</Q></P>
<P>There is nothing in these texts that enjoins the perpetuity of the symbols. The words, <HI>till he come,</HI> shews the observance of them to be no longer of obligation than <HI>till his second coming.</HI> We do not read, You shall thus participate of the signs through all future generations; nor have we any specific direction <HI>how often</HI> they should be used in the interval, which indicates a liberty in that respect; but no authority for their extension beyond the time of the Lord's coming. When they were received, it was to be <HI>in remembrance of him,</HI> which must be during <HI>his absence</HI> from them; for when present, he must be an object of <HI>sense,</HI> not of <HI>remembrance;</HI> therefore the time intended for the reception of those tokens

<P>This <HI>second coming</HI> of our Lord he had repeatedly given them sufficient ground to expect should be after a spiritual manner.<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 28.</NOTE> "Ye have heard," said he, <Q>how I said unto you, I go away, and <HI>come again to you.</HI></Q> He had assured them of this, where he told them,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid xiv. 16, 17, 18.</NOTE> <Q>I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever: even the spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him; but ye know him, for <HI>he dwelleth with you,</HI> and <HI>shall be in you.</HI> I will not leave you comfortless: <HI>I will come to you.</HI></Q> Here he first speaks of himself in the third person under the name of the Comforter, the spirit of truth; and then assuming the first, inculcates, that he who was then a strength and comfort to them, <HI>without them,</HI> by his bodily pre∣sence, should, after his corporeal departure, <HI>come again in spirit,</HI> to be the strength and comfort of his followers <HI>within them,</HI> and to abide with them for ever. He also shewed, that his spiritual advent, and indwelling, was not to be confined to his present disciples; but should also be manifested to all that love him, and keep his commandments.<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">John v. 23.</NOTE> <Q>If any man love me, he will keep my words, and my Father will love him, and <HI>we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The apostle Paul likewise concurrently testified,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Heb. ix. 28.</NOTE> <Q>Christ was offered to bear the sins of many, and unto them that <HI>look for him,</HI> shall he appear the <HI>second time</HI> without sin unto salvation.</Q> To those who then looked for him in spirit he certainly did
<PB N="32" REF="019924_0031_0FE1A48BEDEC9398"/>come, according to that testimony of John,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">1 John v. 20.</NOTE> <Q>We know that the Son of God <HI>is come,</HI> and hath <HI>given us an understanding,</HI> that we may <HI>know him</HI> that is true; and we are <HI>in him</HI> that is true; even in his Son Jesus Christ.</Q> This coming of Christ, by which they received an understanding that they were <HI>in him,</HI> must be after a spiritual manner, agree∣able to his promise, John xiv. 20. <Q>At that day, <HI>ye shall know,</HI> that I am in my Father, and <HI>you in me,</HI> and <HI>I in you.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Thus they experienced the knowledge of that great gospel-mystery, which had been hid from ages and generations in forms and shadows:<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Col. i. 26, 27.</NOTE> "But now" saith the apostle, <Q>is made manifest to his saints, to whom God would make known what is <HI>the riches</HI> of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is <HI>Christ in you,</HI> the hope of glory.</Q></P>
<P>The inward and true Christian thus knows him to be come, by the illuminating and quickening life he receives from him; which all ought inwardly to seek after, and not stick in the outward and visible sign, with an expectation to find him in that from whence he is risen. They who look only thus outwardly for him, in truth see him not.<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 29.</NOTE> <Q>Yet a little while," said he, "and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me, because I live, ye shall live also.</Q> The unregenerate world could discern no more of him than his corporeal appear∣ance, and when that was removed, they saw him no more; but those who have been baptized <HI>into him,</HI> as a vital principle of divine life, still spiritually see him, and because he lives in them, they live also; and by the influence of his Holy Spirit are most effectually kept in mind of the shedding of his
<PB N="33" REF="019924_0032_0FE1A493B2A024E0"/>precious blood without the gates of Jerusalem,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">1 John ii. 2.</NOTE> <HI>as a propitiation for their sins, and not for theirs only, but for the sins of the whole world.</HI> These stand not in need of signs and symbols to remind them of him. They cannot be forgetful of that inexpressible love and mercy, wherein he gave up his prepared body to die, that they might live; but are graciously pre∣served in humble thankfulness, and deep admiration, that he should so condescend to suffer for them, who must ever acknowledge themselves most unworthy of such astonishing goodness.</P>
<P>The outward and visible sign appears to have been recommended by our Lord, only for the interval between his personal departure and his spiritual return, the use of it being to commemorate his death till he came; consequently, when he was come, the observance of it was no longer obligatory, but occasionally permitted, like the washing of one another's feet, or the anointing of the sick with oil, till they should gradually drop away, as the reality wherein they terminated should advance in the hearts of the believers. But the progress of these in spirituality being early obstructed, by the disincli∣nation of many towards the cross; their love to truth, and zeal for it waxed cold, and a disposition prevailed to rest in symbolical religion, which they could easily practise, without parting with their inward corruptions, and walking in that self-denial the gospel requires. This became an exercise to the apostles, and occasioned Paul to query,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 9.—iii. 3.</NOTE> <Q>How turn ye again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereunto ye desire again to be in bondage?— Are ye so foolish? Having begun in the spirit, are ye now made perfect by the flesh?</Q></P>

<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Rev. iii. 20.</NOTE> "Behold," saith Christ, <Q>I stand at the door and knock; if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will <HI>sup with him,</HI> and <HI>he with me.</HI></Q> This is the true supper of the Lord, which stands not in partaking of the outward elements one with another, but in the participation of his divine life, the true bread from heaven, and the new wine of the kingdom. This is also communicated in religious congregations, to those of<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Phil. iii. 3.</NOTE> <Q>the circumcision which worship God in the spirit, and rejoice in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh." When such draw near to him, he draws near to them.<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Mat. xviii. 20.</NOTE> "Where two or three," said he, "are gathered together <HI>into my name,</HI> there <HI>am I</HI> in the midst of them.</Q> Our common translation has it <HI>in my name;</HI> but in the original it is <GAP DESC="foreign" DISP="〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉"/><HI>into my name;</HI> which <HI>name,</HI> as observed in the preceding chapter, is the power and virtue of his spirit, wherein alone true Christian communion is enjoyed.</P>
<P>The spiritually-minded under former dispensations were not excluded from this communion. The apostle shews, that the fathers of Israel<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x. 4.</NOTE> <Q>did all eat of the same spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink; for <HI>they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them, and that rock was Christ.</HI></Q> He also intimates, that himself and his brethren then partook in the same spiritual communion, under the metaphorical terms of <HI>the body and blood of Christ.</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid ver. 16, 17.</NOTE> <Q>The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Christ?</Q> As if he had said, Is it but the outward shadow, and not the inward and spiritual reality? Certainly
<PB N="35" REF="019924_0034_0FE1A67BAAEE3C00"/>it is, for <Q>we being many are one bread, and one body; for we are all partakers of that one bread.</Q> This implies, that by the participation of the <HI>one spirit of life</HI> in Christ Jesus, they were, in their several measures, made partakers of the divine nature, and, through its cementing virtue, were inwardly united one unto another, as members of the same spiritual body, and all unto Christ the head;<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Col. ii. 19.</NOTE> <Q>from which, saith the apostle, "all the body by joints and bands having nourishment ministered, and knit together, increaseth with the increase of God.</Q></P>
<P>Having spoken to such as had experienced a degree of inward sanctification, the apostle turns to those intemperate carnal professors, who had fallen into a shameful abuse of the outward sign.<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Cor. xi. 20.27, &amp;c.</NOTE> These he sharply reproved, and intimated to them, that as often as they partook of the exterior elements, it ought to have been in a reverent remembrance of him who suffered for them. For whilst they had no discerning, or inward sense, of his spiritual body, and persisted in such abuse of the form, he let them know they ate and drank to their own condemnation; for such as partake but of the sign, under a pretence of divine communion, and do it so unworthily, are in the judgment of the apostle, guilty of vilifying the body and blood of the Lord; because, whilst they profess to honour him, they, by their evil conduct, may be said, in some respect,<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">Heb. vi. 6.</NOTE> <HI>to crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to an open shame.</HI></P>
<P>Though our Saviour was seen of his disciples at times forty days after his resurrection, he partook not with them of any outward species in the form of communion, as may be concluded from his own
<PB N="36" REF="019924_0035_0FF1A67DF5FD80B0"/>words, <Q>I will not drink henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it <HI>new</HI> with you in my Father's kingdom.</Q> He knew, though it was still hid from them, that by the regenerating baptism of the Holy Ghost, they should be made <HI>new creatures,</HI> and inwardly trans∣lated into that spiritual kingdom, wherein he would give them to partake with him of the new wine thereof. For<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Mat. vi. 10.</NOTE> the coming of this kingdom he had before taught them to pray, and also told them,<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Mark ix. 1.</NOTE> <Q>There be some of them that stand here, who shall not taste of death till they have seen the kingdom of God come with power.</Q> He had also informed them, that this kingdom<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Luke xvii. 20, 21.</NOTE> <HI>cometh not with observation, or outward shew; for,</HI> said he, <HI>the kingdom of God is within you.</HI></P>
<P>If this kingdom cometh not with outward obser∣vation, it is in vain to seek it by outward observations, and to pretend to support it by them. If it be within us, it must be an inward and spiritual king∣dom, and it cannot come to us, but by the spirit. And if, as the apostle declares,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom. xiv. 17.</NOTE> <Q>the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost,</Q> it is not bread and wine; which are meat and drink. As the kingdom is spiritual, its communion is spiritual, and its receivers are spiritually such. Well therefore might the apostle say,<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid ii. 28, 29.</NOTE> <Q>He is not a Jew who is one outwardly, neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh; but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is <HI>that of the heart in the spirit,</HI> and not in the letter.</Q> Thus it is with the Christian. He is not a real Christian, who is only one by profession and form; neither is that the baptism, nor the communion of the gospel,
<PB N="37" REF="019924_0036_0FE1A67F8484D470"/>which is outward and ceremonial; but he is a Christian who is one inwardly, and that is the true baptism, and the true communion, which is <HI>of the heart, in the spirit,</HI> and not in the letter, or outward form. With what sound reason then can any insist on the practice of outward and visible signs, as if the very existence of Christianity depended upon them, and that persons of the greatest faith, piety, and probity, could have no claim to the name of Chris∣tians without them?</P>
<P>Had the most eminent of the evangelists, <HI>John,</HI> esteemed the continuance of the <HI>sign</HI> to have been of essential moment, or lasting obligation, he would hardly have failed to mention it as such. He is particularly expressive of the circumstance of our Saviour's washing his disciples feet, shewing that he both enjoined it with great precision, and recom∣mended it by his example; yet it is generally agreed to have been only figurative and temporary, and therefore disused by Protestants, and very little practised by the Romanists; but John, in his relation of the transactions of that important evening, passeth the outward supper wholly without notice. His total omission of it may reasonably intimate, that when he wrote his history, which was long after the rest of the evangelists, the season for it was fully past; and that the use of it had been only meant as a figure, to weak converts for a time, and then to drop away, and give place to the reality.</P>
<P>Yet, notwithstanding this apostolic historian hath omitted the ceremonial, he hath given a large account of our Lord's discourse concerning the substance, in chap. 6. wherein, amongst many other similar expressions, he saith,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">John vi. 32, 51, 54.</NOTE> <Q>My Father giveth you the <HI>true bread</HI> from heaven—I am the <HI>living bread</HI>
<PB N="38" REF="019924_0037_0FE1A6819DBEDA58"/>which came down from heaven—Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life.</Q> This intimates, that those who spiritually partake of the <HI>divine life in him,</HI> which is of an eternal nature, receive the <HI>living bread,</HI> and the <HI>flesh and blood</HI> he here intended. Such feed not of that body which suffered on the cross, but of his spiritual body, which is a mystery to the carnal mind.</P>
<P>Knowing in himself, that by apprehending his metaphorical expressions in a literal sense, many of his disciples, as well as the Jews, took offence, he, for explanation, directly told them, verse 63. <Q>It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth nothing.</Q> From whence it appears, that could we eat the very flesh, and drink the blood of the outward body of Christ, <HI>it would not profit us.</HI> How vain and useless therefore, as well as contrary to sense and reason, is the Romish notion, that the bread consecrated by a priest, is transubstantiated into that body of flesh and blood, which, if actually received, <HI>would profit nothing</HI> to the soul!</P>
<P>It is both carnal and absurd to inser, that upon our Saviour's blessing the bread, it instantly became <HI>that very body</HI> which brake it, handed it to the disciples, and <HI>ate of it</HI> with them. But, that a new-made wafer, or a piece of bread of yesterday, should, upon the priest's imitative performance of a mere ceremony, be instantly rendered that very body of Christ, which existed many hundred years before it, and that it is to be worshipped <HI>as God;</HI> and also that <HI>every one</HI> of the many thousands of these consecrated wafers is <HI>the whole</HI> of that same body; and all this, whilst they remain as utterly unchanged, to every evidence of sense and reason, as when they came out of the hands of the baker; that any people should suffer these manifest impossi∣bilities to be imposed upon them as mysterious
<PB N="39" REF="019924_0038_0FE1A68AA3681A28"/>truths, is a flagrant instance of the great subtlety of Satan, the boldness of his instruments, and the credulity of mankind.</P>
<P>This irrational and idolatrous abuse hath arisen from the taking expressions, evidently figurative, in a literal sense. Take the connecting verb <HI>is,</HI> in the phrases, "This <HI>is</HI> my body, this <HI>is</HI> my blood," in like manner with many parallel expressions in scrip∣ture, and the mystery is easily solved, without putting any unnatural force upon the text, or any imposition upon the senses, understandings, or consciences of mankind. We read,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Gen. xli. 26.</NOTE> <Q>The seven good kine <HI>are</HI> seven years, and the seven good ears <HI>are</HI> seven years.—<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Gal. iv. 5.</NOTE> This Agar <HI>is</HI> mount Sinai in Arabia.—<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Rev. xvii. 9, 12.</NOTE> The seven heads <HI>are</HI> seven mountains. —The ten horns thou sawest <HI>ar</HI> ten kings.</Q> These are universally allowed to have been only <HI>representative signs</HI> of what they are literally said <HI>to be.</HI> In like manner, those expressions of our Lord, "This <HI>is</HI> my body, This <HI>is</HI> my blood," figuratively signified, the bread and wine to be <HI>exterior signs,</HI> representing, that as they imparted strength and refreshment to the body, the communication of his spiritual body should afford strength and refreshment to the soul.</P>
<P>Whatever any thing feeds upon must be of a nature suitable to its own. The soul, being of a spiritual nature, is not to be fed with material flesh and blood; the body prepared for Christ to appear in upon earth was such; therefore it was not that body concerning which he said,<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">John vi. 54 to 58.</NOTE> <Q>Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, <HI>hath eternal life,</HI> and I will raise him up at the last day. For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed. He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh
<PB N="40" REF="019924_0039_0FE1A68C26085018"/>my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.</Q> This flesh and blood is, therefore, another kind of body than that material one, wherein he then appeared to the world. It is a spiritual body, suitable and alimentary to the soul; the true life of which is spiritual, and its feeding spiritual: <HI>The flesh profits it nothing.</HI> It is both quickened and supported by that spiritual body of Christ (metaphorically called the<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. x.</NOTE> <HI>Rock</HI>) upon which the fathers of Israel fed long before he took the outward body upon him, and upon which the primitive Christians fed, and all who are truly such now feed, and, like them, become nourished up unto eternal life.</P>
<P>The rituals of the Mosaic law were once of divine institution, but being only<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Heb. x. 1.</NOTE> <HI>shadows of good things to come</HI> in the spiritual dispensation of the gospel, the good things themselves being come, their shadows appear to us no longer obligatory; so the exterior forms of water-baptism and the supper, <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shadows of the good things already come under the spiritual ministration of the Saviour, are <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>perceded thereby, and become of no more force than the past rudiments of the law. Nevertheless, we condemn not those who are conscientious in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of them. <Q>Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind.</Q></P>
<P>The profane as well as the pious may partake of the outward elements. Judas partook of these, even when Satan had entered him, and he had covenanted to betray his Lord; but he could not in that state participate of the true communion with him; therefore the outward supper is not the true communion.</P>
<P><PB N="41" REF="019924_0040_0FE1A68DA9C5E458"/>
The communion of the church triumphant in heaven, and that of the church militant upon earth, is in the same spirit. It is the communion of the Holy Ghost in both; but the latter being in a state of travail and probation, amidst the temptations and trials of the world, doth not enjoy it in that uninterrupted brightness and fulness, which the former doth in the state of perfect purity and immu∣table glory.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. ON WAITING UPON GOD, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE apostle Paul shewed, that<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Tim. ii. 5.</NOTE> <Q>there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 18.</NOTE> through whom we have access <HI>by one spirit</HI> unto the Father,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. i. 6.</NOTE> and <HI>in whom alone</HI> we are accepted.</Q> We have no power to draw near unto God but by him.<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 6.</NOTE> <Q>I am the way," said he, "and the truth, and the life; no man cometh unto the Father but by me.</Q> In order to worship aright, therefore, we must first wait for him, that we may feel the power of his spirit in our hearts, to illuminate, quicken, and enable us, inwardly to approach the throne of divine grace, in faith and resignation; that our offerings may come up with acceptance on his holy altar.</P>
<P>The communication of his spirit being of his own free grace, it is not in the power of man to obtain it when he pleaseth; therefore, it must be waited for. Activity, in exterior ordinances, is an employment very different from true waiting; which
<PB N="42" REF="019924_0041_0FE1A68FDE2C0790"/>consists in a solemn and steady inward retirement of soul to him, in humility, faith, and patience, that he may condescend to renew its strength in him, and enable it to worship him in spirit and in truth, according to his will.</P>
<P>In this practice, the people of God, in all gene∣rations, sensibly experienced the times of refreshing from his presence, and ability to withstand tempta∣tion, to hold on their way amidst the various assaults of the powers of evil, and occasionally to stand firm in suffering for his glorious cause. Hence we find them, in holy writ, frequent in expressing the benefit of waiting upon God, and earnest in their exhorta∣tions to it. Let us attend to a few instances.</P>
<P>Psalm xxvii. 14. <Q>Wait on the Lord. Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart. Wait, I say, on the Lord.</Q> This contains encouragement, and repeated exhortation to waiting.</P>
<P>Hosea xii. 6. <Q>Turn thou to thy God; keep mercy and judgment, and wait on thy God continually.</Q> This intimates the necessity of perseverance in waiting, as well as in the practice of uprightness and charity.</P>
<P>Psalm xxxiii. 20. <Q>Our soul <HI>waiteth for</HI> the Lord; he is our help, and our shield.</Q> This shews, their waiting upon him was in expectation of his divine assistance.</P>
<P>Isa. xl. 31. <Q>They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not faint.</Q> Herein are held forth gracious assurances of quickening strength in the practice of waiting.</P>
<P>Micah vii. 7. <Q>I will look unto the Lord; I will <HI>wait for</HI> the God of my salvation. My God will hear me.</Q> This indicates the holy resolution of the prophet, and his confidence in waiting.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="019924_0042_0FE1A6958D2F9470"/>
Habak. ii. 1. <Q>I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and will watch to see what he will say unto me, or <HI>in me,</HI> and what I shall answer when I am reproved.</Q> Watching here is synonymous with waiting, and this passage denotes the dependance of the prophet, in this inward and mental exercise, to have been upon the Lord for instruction.</P>
<P>Psal. xl. 1, 2. <Q>I waited patiently for the Lord, and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.</Q> This evinces the propriety of a continuance in waiting, and the happy success attending it.</P>
<P>That this waiting was not only the practice of particulars, but also of the congregated bodies of God's people, appears from that reprehension of the spirit of prophecy in Ezekiel, against the insincere amongst the Israelites:<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ezek. xxxiii. 31.</NOTE> <Q>They come unto thee <HI>as the people cometh,</HI> and <HI>they sit before thee as my people,</HI> and they hear thy words; but they will not do them.</Q></P>
<P>We also find, that whilst the elders of Judah sate before the prophet, he was led through such a variety of divine visions concerning the state of that people, as take up from chap. viii. 1. to chap. xi. 4. to relate. During the time he was thus inwardly engaged, the elders undoubtedly <HI>sate in silence,</HI> as well as himself; for in conclusion, he saith, <Q>The spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said unto me, Speak,</Q> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Psalm xxxvii. 7. and lxii. 1. shew the waiting of the Lord's servants began, and continued for some time <HI>in silence;</HI> for, according to the Hebrew, these texts are, <Q><HI>Be silent to the Lord,</HI> and wait patiently
<PB N="44" REF="019924_0043_0FE1A6974F95D670"/>for him."—"Truly my soul <HI>is silent upon God</HI> (or silent in attention upon him) from him cometh my salvation.</Q></P>
<P>Lam. iii. 25, 28. <Q>The Lord is good unto them that <HI>wait for him,</HI> to the soul that seeketh him. It is good that a man should both hope, and <HI>quietly wait</HI> for the salvation of the Lord. It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth. He sitteth alone, and <HI>keepeth silence,</HI> because he hath borne it upon him.</Q> Here is great encouragement to the submissive silent waiter.</P>
<P>The evangelical prophet is still more expressive.</P>
<P>Isa. lxiv. 4. <Q>Since the beginning of the world, men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, besides thee, what he hath prepared for him that <HI>waiteth</HI> for him.</Q> This evidenceth, there is something more excellent than is possible to the conceived by the natural, or unregenerate, man, to be enjoyed in devout and patient waiting. Hence ariseth the fervency of zeal for thus waiting, and the great earnestness therein of those who experienced the benefit of it; which we find emphatically expressed in the following texts.</P>
<P>Psalm cxxx. 6. <Q>My soul waiteth for the Lord <HI>more</HI> than they that watch for the morning: I say, <HI>more</HI> than they that watch for the morning.</Q></P>
<P>Isa. xxvi. 9. <Q>With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early.</Q></P>
<P>Psalm xlii. 1, 2. <Q>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God! My soul <HI>thirsteth</HI> for God, for the living God. When shall I come and appear before God?</Q></P>
<P>As the spiritually-minded, under past dispensa∣tions, were sensible of their inability properly to
<PB N="45" REF="019924_0044_0FE1A698D16E76A0"/>discharge their respective duties, without the renewed assistance of God's Holy Spirit, and therefore often waited upon him to receive it; so under this gospel-dispensation, which essentially is the pure ministra∣tion of the Spirit, it must necessarily be waited for. Our Lord therefore directed this dispensation to commence <HI>in solemn waiting.</HI> For, being assembled together with his disciples,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Acts i. 4.</NOTE> he <Q>commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father:</Q><HI>the enduement of power from on high.</HI> Accordingly, whilst the disciples were congregated and sitting together with <HI>one accord,</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid ii. 4.</NOTE> <Q>they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and <HI>began to speak</HI> with other tongues, as the spirit gave them utterance.</Q></P>
<P>Thus led into solemn waiting by their Lord and Master, and divinely favoured therein, the primitive Christians had sufficient ground to continue the practice; which it appears they did from the follow∣ing texts: 1 Cor. i. 6, 7, 8. <Q>The testimony of Christ was confirmed in you; so that ye come behind in no gift, <HI>waiting for the coming,</HI> or revelation, <HI>of our Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> who shall also confirm you unto the end.</Q> This shews they received the gifts of the spirit, and the confirmation of it, through waiting."</P>
<P>1 Thes. i. 9, 10. <Q>Ye turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God, and to <HI>wait for his Son from heaven.</HI></Q> And, 2 Thes. iii. 5. the apostle prays, <Q>The Lord direct your hearts into the love of God, and <HI>into the patient waiting for Christ.</HI></Q> This patient waiting for the revelation of Christ from heaven, must have an immediate respect to their worship, as well as to their qualification for service, and is to be understood
<PB N="46" REF="019924_0045_0FE1A69AF93802A0"/>of his inward and spiritual appearance; which the apostle gives comfortable assurance of, Heb. ix. 28. <Q>Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many, and <HI>unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time, without sin unto salvation.</HI></Q> By this we understand, that as he once appeared after an outward and corporeal manner, and gave up the body prepared for him, as an expiation for the sins of all who should come to repentance; so to those who should <HI>look internally for him</HI> in faith, he shall <HI>again appear</HI> by the revelation of his spirit in their hearts, to effect the work of regeneration in them, in order to their eternal salvation. For, this <HI>second appearance</HI> of Christ to those who <HI>piously look,</HI> and <HI>patiently wait,</HI> for him, cannot intend his <HI>last advent;</HI> for then he shall also appear to those that <HI>look not for him</HI> with desire, to their final condemnation.</P>
<P>From what hath been said, it may sufficiently appear, that waiting upon God in silence, faith, and patience, is not a modern peculiarity originated among the people called Quakers, nor the fruit of a despicable enthusiasm; but a necessary practice of ancient date and long continuance amongst the Lord's people, as preparatory and requisite to the reception of divine ability to<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. xiv. 15.</NOTE> <HI>pray with the spirit, and with a right understanding also.</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">1 Pet. iv. 7.</NOTE> "Watch unto prayer," said Peter. Paul likewise exhorts to the duty of<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 18.</NOTE> <Q>praying always with all prayer and supplication <HI>in the spirit,</HI> and <HI>watching thereunto</HI> with all perseverance.</Q></P>
<P>Having experimentally received an inward sense of the divine goodness in thus waiting, the living amongst the people above-mentioned are engaged to sit down in a watchful stillness, both in their public meetings and private retirements, before Him who made heaven and earth, the seas, and the fountains
<PB N="47" REF="019924_0046_0FE1A6A12DE93450"/>of waters; and whoever have any clear sense of the spirit, know it draws their minds into this still waiting for it, so pathetically recommended in holy writ, and so beneficially practised by those who have devoted their souls to the God of their life, and their never-failing helper in time of need. Let none, therefore, by rejecting and deriding what they have not experienced, lose the precious opportunity now afforded them; but address themselves earnestly to<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Isa. lv. 6.</NOTE> <HI>seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near,</HI> that happily in<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Acts xvii. 27</NOTE> <HI>feeling after him they may find him, who is not far from every one of us.</HI></P>
<P>If we suffer the low concerns of this mutable world, its earthly profits, or deceitful pleasures, its friendships, fashions, or any other of its corruptions, to attach our minds, and divert them from attending to the motions of the spirit of God in our hearts, till we fill up such a measure of iniquity as shall occasion him to forsake us, we may seek him after∣wards, as Esau did the blessing, in vain. For, he saith,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Gen. vi. 3.</NOTE> <Q>My spirit shall not always strive with man.</Q> Time sufficient for repentance is afforded to all, and the will of God is our sanctification. Why then, some may query, are we not sanctified? Is Satan too strong for Almighty power? By no means. Such questions are started from improper grounds. As the Lord, in wisdom, hath made man a reasonable creature, he deals with him according to reason, and not by absolute force. He shews him good and evil, with their opposite consequences, persuades, intreats, and presseth him to refuse the evil, and choose the good, that he may reap the fruit of it; even eternal life. If the will of man be so perverse, as to prefer a continuance in the gratifications of sin, he sows to the flesh, and of the flesh must reap corruption. If he wilfully reject
<PB N="48" REF="019924_0047_0FE1A6A4527B9CF8"/>the kind reproofs of the spirit in his own conscience, to the full extent of divine sufferance, as revolting Jerusalem did, he sins out the day of his merciful visitation, grace is withdrawn from him, his oppor∣tunity is lost, and the way of peace is hid from his eyes. Knowing this, the good apostle thus earnestly addressed the believers:<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. vi. 1.</NOTE> <Q>We then as workers together with Him, beseech you also, that ye receive not the grace of God in vain.</Q> For, though the grace of God that brings salvation hath appeared to all men, its appearance is rendered in vain to such as by their disobedience to it, and rejection of it, frustrate the accomplishment of its gracious end and purpose towards them.</P>
<P>It is a weak argument, that we have now a complete canon of the scriptures, and therefore have less need of the spirit than the primitives; as if the letter could supply the place, and do the work of the spirit. As all men by a natural and corpo∣real birth enter into the kingdom of this world; so our Saviour himself shewed the Jewish ruler<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">John iii.</NOTE>, that unless we experience a spiritual and supernatural birth, we cannot enter into the kingdom of God. The holy scriptures, which so strongly recommend us to be led by the spirit, to live in the spirit, and to walk in the spirit, could not be intended to supersede and set aside the spirit, and to render its internal operation unnecessary.</P>
<P>The apostle Paul, who had a share of both divine and human knowledge, teaches that<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">1 Cor. ii. 14.</NOTE> <HI>the natural</HI> or unregenerate man (notwithstanding his arts, languages, and philosophy) <HI>receiveth not the things of the spirit of God, for they are fooliskness unto him; neither can he know them</HI> (by his learned researches) <HI>because they are spiritually discerned.</HI> That is, they are only to be understood by the light of the
<PB N="49" REF="019924_0048_0FE1A6A5D428FED8"/>spirit; and therefore to be received by its own illumination. We may gather up theoretic notions concerning them from the declarations of those who did receive them; but this will not convey the realities they express to us. It will center far short of creating us anew in Christ Jesus, without which we may profess ourselves Christians; but<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Gal. v. 24.</NOTE> <Q>they that are Christ's, have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts.</Q></P>
<P>But some, who allow that the assistance of the Holy Spirit is still afforded to mankind, deny that any man now hath an internal sense of it, so as to distinguish its motions in them from those of their own minds. But, certainly, whoever feels any inward convictions for sin conceived or committed, not under the cognizance of law, nor open to other mens knowledge, may easily distinguish the motions of the reproved which leads into sin, from those of the reprover who smites for it, to lead out of it; and if any ever become insensible of it, it is for want of obeying it. Such as continue to reject it, may occasion it to become silent in them for a season; but it always remains present with them, though they feel it not, and will revive upon them with inexpressible terror, at a time when they shall find no way to escape.</P>
<P>1 John iii. 24. and iv. 13. we read, <Q>Hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the spirit which he hath given us.—Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his spirit.</Q> This inculcates that the Holy Spirit, like the sun in the firmament, manifests itself to the mind by its own evidence. Yet, not∣withstanding<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">John i. 5, 9.</NOTE> <Q>the true light which lighteth every man that cometh into the world,</Q> shineth in the dark hearts of men; if they wilfully retain their
<PB N="50" REF="019924_0049_0FE1A6A81CC2AFA8"/>darkness, they comprehend not the light.<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Job xxiv. 13.</NOTE> <Q>Those that rebel against the light, they know not the ways thereof.</Q> Abiding under the beclouding influence of prejudice, unbelief, or self-confidence, they shut themselves up against the light, and often decry and ridicule it; but those who embrace it as from God, come to experience the new-birth of the spirit, and in the new-birth receive a new life, and in the new life a new sense. The life and sense of the first birth are carnal; the life and sense of the second are spiritual, which nothing but the spirit can communicate.</P>
<P>Peter told the regenerate formerly,<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">I Pet. i. 22.</NOTE> <Q>Ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit.</Q> They had joined the truth, that is, the spirit of truth, in its operation to the purification of their souls, and certainly, not without a sense of it. This spirit of truth is the spirit of Christ, which he promised should come to<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">John xvi. 8, 13</NOTE> <HI>reprove, or convince, the world of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment, and to guide into all truth.</HI></P>
<P>Hence we see, the spirit cometh not only to rebuke, convince, and disquiet mankind in evil to lead them out of it, but also to accompany them in faithful∣ness, and guide them into all truth. For when they are brought to receive it, believe in it, and cleave to it, they become the sheep of Christ; they<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">John x. 3, 4, 14, 27.</NOTE> <HI>hear and follow him,</HI> for <HI>they know his voice;</HI> that is, they are enabled to distinguish the motions of his spirit from those of <HI>the stranger, which they will not follow, but flee from.</HI></P>
<P>There is as much difference betwixt the internal voice of Christ, and other voices, as there is between light and darkness.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Ibid viii. 12.</NOTE> "He that followeth me," said he, <Q>shall not walk in darkness; but shall have
<PB N="51" REF="019924_0050_0FE1A6B046F4BB30"/>the light of life.</Q> He that walks in the light, must necessarily see by it, and have a sense of it.</P>
<P><NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">John xiv. 12.</NOTE> <Q>He that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and <HI>manifest myself to him.</HI></Q> This manifestation of himself to those who love him is by his spirit, and the manifestation of his spirit must be the discovery of it the soul of him to whom it is manifested. There can be no mani∣festation to any but those who receive a sense of it; for that cannot be manifested to me, which I have no distinct perception of. Insensible manifestation is a self-contradiction.</P>
<P>Eph. ii. 1. <Q>You hath he quickened, who were dead in trespasses and sins</Q> Who hath not been, more or less, in the death of trespasses and sins? And who ever experienced a resurrection from this death, unto life in Christ, by the quickening power of his spirit, without a living sense of it? Insensibi∣lity is not a property of life, but of death; therefore the living members of the body or church of Christ, cannot be insensible of the life of Christ, by which their souls are quickened, or made alive in him.</P>
<P>The ministration of the spirit hath ever been the life of true religion. The fairest form, and most plausible profession, are no more than a lifeless letter without it.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. iii. 6.</NOTE> <Q>The letter killeth, but the spirit giveth life;</Q> and whosoever receiveth the spirit, receiveth life, and those who receive life, receive a sense of that life; for life is not without sense in proportion to its degree, and the higher degree of life any receive, the more sensible they are of its quickening virtue.</P>
<P>The express terms of the new covenant, cited from the prophet, Heb. viii. 10, 11, are, <Q>This is the convenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws
<PB N="52" REF="019924_0051_0FE1A6B2270EB010"/>into their mind, and write them in their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people. And they shall not (of absolute necessity) "teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, know the Lord, for all shall know me from the least to the greatest.</Q></P>
<P>This plainly shews, that under the gospel-esta∣blishment, <HI>the Lord himself is the teacher of his people, and that individually;</HI> that he openeth his law in their hearts so clearly and indubitably, that none who duly attend to his immediate instructions, in their consciences, need to remain under a necessity of being taught their duty to him by their brethren, or their neighbours.</P>
<P>From the gracious illumination of this Divine Teacher, ariseth the strongest internal evidence of the truth of Christianity to those who become subject to his instruction. Many, under various denominations, have acknowledged, that the truth and excellence of the Christian dispensation hath been rendered more clear and certain to them by this inward principle, than by all other kinds of evidence whatsoever; and it is a great proof of the good will of God to man∣kind, that he hath laid open to all, whether learned or void of literature, this shortest and surest way to that evidence, which brings with it the most clear and cogent degree of convincement.</P>
<P><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rom. vi. 25.</NOTE> "We are not under the law; but under grace," saith the apostle. Great grace indeed! That the God of infinite wisdom, and immutable excellence, should condescend to be our immediate teacher! With what cordiality, humility, and thankfulness ought we to ac∣cept of and embrace it; ever remembering that awful warning,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Heb. xii. 25.</NOTE> <Q>See that ye refuse not him that speaketh; for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven.</Q></P>

<HEAD>REASONS FOR THE NECESSITY OF SILENT WAITING, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>SOLOMON saith,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. xvi. 1.</NOTE> "The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, are from the Lord." If the Lord alone can prepare the heart, stir it up, or incline it towards unfeigned holiness, how can any man approach him acceptably till his heart be prepared by him? And how can he know this preparation, except he wait in silence to feel it?<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Eph. ii. 18.</NOTE> It is by the spirit that believers have access to the Father; and are not the impressions and influ∣ences of the spirit to be felt and distinguished from the workings of our own carnal minds? If they are, ought not believers to wait patiently in silent submission of soul, in order to distinguish when the golden sceptre is stretched out, which gives liberty to approach the Sacred Presence? And must not the preparations of the heart by the spirit make us sensible of our real wants, before we can ask aright; and also of our miserable state, before we can seek that relief which is proper for us? Must not the spirit likewise impart help and consolation to us, before we can rejoice in its salvation, praise the Lord on the banks of deliverance, and make sweet melody in our hearts unto him? Can we bow before him in true reverence and fear, in faith, till the spirit hath
<PB N="4" REF="019924_0054_0FE1A6BD33DCD718"/>mercifully begot these sensations in the soul? Must not the carnal mind, which is at enmity with God, be silenced in us before these impressions prevail over all? If we presume to approach him without the sensible drawings of his spirit, may we not speak unadvisedly with our lips, and offer somewhat like the polluted sacrifice of the wicked, which is an abomination to him, and therefore cannot be accept∣able from a disciple of Christ? To such the apostle saith,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Phil. ii. 13.</NOTE> "It is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleasure." Must we not consequently wait in silence till this will be raised in us, and power given us to perform a holy worship, and to offer an offering in righteousness?</P>
<P>The influences of the spirit are not at our com∣mand, circumscribed in our time, or limitted by our wills, and therefore must be humbly waited for, seeing we can have no access without it; and if that in which all our spiritual ability and strength is, be not our own, nor at our command, but must be freely dispensed to us afresh by the great Giver, must we not submissively wait in silence for his qualifying power, by which alone we can move aright? Hence David, deeply sensible of his own inability, saith, Psalm lxii. 1. "Truly my soul waiteth upon (or, as in the margin, is silent before) God; from him cometh my salvation;" and verse 5. "my soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him."</P>
<P>Do not these remarks clearly point out the necessity of our patiently waiting upon the Lord in silence, for renewed strength, that by the inward and power∣ful operations of his Spirit, he may pluck the feet of our minds out of the mire and clay of corrupt thoughts and carnal inclinations, and also beget a suitable concern and travail of spirit in us, that from
<PB N="5" REF="019924_0055_0FE1A6BF41D98E78"/>the arising of a true spiritual exercise, the mouth may speak what the panting soul feels when it is athirst for God; or, at least, be humbly sensible of those sighs and groans begotten therein by the Spirit, which cannot be uttered in words? Is not this concern and exercise wherein the soul is deeply engaged, and the judgment clearly convinced, more acceptable to the all-seeing God, who calls for truth in the inward parts, than a multitude of fine unfelt expressions dropt from the lips, whilst the heart is wandering without due restraint, far from a sense of his presence? Nay, will not five words spoke from a good understanding under the influence of the Holy Spirit, have more weight with the Almighty, than five thousand uttered from a lukewarm, insensible, or careless mind? Can we suppose the infinitely wise Creator of all things is, like short-sighted man, either to be deceived or pleased with our much speaking? Our Lord saith, "When ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the Heathen do, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking. Be not ye therefore like unto them; for your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him." Mat. vi. 7, 8.</P>
<P>The inspired prophet Isaiah, in the last verse of the fortieth chapter, saith, "They that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength." In the first verse of the next chapter immediately succeeding, he shews what is meant by waiting in these words, "Keep silence before me, O islands! and let the people renew their strength." Certainly this silence imports the same thing as waiting in the former verse, seeing the same effect is attributed to both; and is not the carnal mind and corrupt imagination here commanded to keep silence before God, that the soul may properly wait and watch unto prayer?
<PB N="6" REF="019924_0056_0FE1A6C0C5467E90"/>The prophet adds, "Let them come near, then let them speak." This also appears to call the immortal soul into deep silence, that therein it may first receive divine help to draw near in spirit to the great Jehovah, and then speak forth its humble petition, under a sense of that holy, solemn, awful reverence, which is due from a dependent creature in its approaches towards its Almighty Creator.</P>
<P>A certain minister of the church of England,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Charles Wheatly, M. A. Vicar of Brent and Turner's Pelham, in Hertfordshire.</NOTE> writing on the Common-Prayer, and the sentences placed at the beginning of the service, observes, <Q>That prayer requires so much attention and sere∣nity of mind, that it can never be performed without some preceding preparation; for which reason, says he, according to Bingham's Anti∣quities, vol. 5. book xiii. chap. 11, 12. when the Jews enter into their synagogues to pray, they remain silent for some time, and meditate before whom they stand.</Q> Can we think such a reverent practice amongst Christians would not be more suitable and acceptable to him, who need not be told what we are, than the too common custom of hastily approaching his Sacred Presence, and presuming to speak to him without previous recollection, and due consideration before whom they stand?</P>
<P><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ecclef. v. 1.</NOTE> "Keep thy foot," saith Solomon, "when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools; for they consider not that they do evil." If caution and consideration were requisite under the law of Moses, which made nothing perfect as pertaining to the conscience, how much more is it so under the gospel dispensation, which more directly requires,<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">John iv. 23.</NOTE> that the Lord be worshipped in spirit and in truth; not
<PB N="7" REF="019924_0057_0FE1A6C2EA0DAFA0"/>feignedly with the lip only, but with the whole heart spiritually exercised? What foot is this that must be kept in such subjection? Is it only the foot of the body, and not rather the hasty forwardness of the carnal mind, that the attention of the soul may become fixed upon God, the fountain of all spiritual strength and living mercies, who must teach our hearts to pray, if ever we pray effectually?</P>
<P>Isaiah saith,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Isa. xxvi. 3.</NOTE> "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee, because he trusteth in thee." Can any thing be more consistent with a silent dependent waiting, than a mind stayed upon God, in a sincere confidence and firm expec∣tation of Divine Help; and if it behoves a Christian to have his mind thus frequently stayed upon the Divine Power, how much more in solemn worship, and near approaches to the Sacred Presence, who cannot possibly be deceived, or amused by the arts of composition, or the powers of human eloquence; and who has passed a sentence of<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid xxix. 13.</NOTE> condemnation on the too common practice of drawing near to him with the mouth, and honouring him with the lips, whilst the heart is far from him? How can the soul any way be more uninterruptedly stayed upon him, than in a silent waiting for Divine Help, and the renewings of spiritual power, under a solid attention to hear what he shall reveal unto it, as its present duty?</P>
<P>Christ saith,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">John x. 27.</NOTE> "My sheep hear my voice;" and he further declares,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">John iv. 5.</NOTE> "they know his voice, and a stranger will they not follow." Now, what partakes more of the stranger's voice than self-will and self-sufficiency in Divine service?<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid xv. 5.</NOTE> "Without me, saith the Lord to his disciples, ye can do nothing." That is, nothing really and substantially good, or
<PB N="8" REF="019924_0058_0FE1A6C9E089AE70"/>acceptable to God; because himself is the Lord from heaven, the second Adam, the quickening spirit without whose influence all we offer is void of spirit or life. He is that inexhaustible fountain of power and wisdom, of vital holiness, and saving health to the soul, which, like the sap that ariseth from the root of the vine, is the life and nourishment of every branch. Such is the sensible connection of Christ, the true head of the church, with the several members of his spiritual body: they are dependent upon him, as the branch is on the vine, both sor life, and the daily supply of spiritual nou∣rishment of that life which is hid with Christ in God; how therefore can they pray as they ought, in a spirit and manner suitable to their present wants, till he open their hearts, and teach them, by the wisdom of his spirit, what to pray for? If left to themselves, may they not ask amiss, and conse∣quently not receive? How can the ministers of the everlasting gospel communicate the will of God, till they receive illumination and ability from his spirit, to speak profitably to the present states of the people? How can any come to the throne of Divine Grace without his immediate help and influence? What can raise the sallen soul up to God-ward, and humble it in due prostration before him, give it a deep sense of its wants, and of the riches of his love and mercy, but the Holy Spirit itself? How necessary then, and reasonable it is, that we should patiently wait in submissive silence, for the enlight∣enings and quickenings of its heavenly power, to guide both heart and tongue in addressing the Holy One of Israel? David saith,<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Psal. li. 17.</NOTE> "The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; a broken and a contrite heart, O God! thou wilt not despise." What but his heart-humbling spirit can prepare this sacrifice
<PB N="9" REF="019924_0059_0FE1A6CB63C5E1F8"/>in the soul? If no power but his can do this, must we not consequently watch and wait in silence to receive its assistance, and have the impressions of the spirit before we can pray with the spirit, and with a right understanding also? And seeing the Lord is a God of knowledge, and that by him our actions are weighed, how careful should we be to know what spirit governs and influenceth our souls in his solemn worship!</P>
<P>Solomon, under an awful sense of the Divine Greatness and Majesty, affords us this necessary caution, when we present ourselves before him:<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Eccless. v. 2.</NOTE> "Be not rash with thy mouth." This every one certainly is, who presumes to speak to the Most High before he hath duly considered in whose pre∣sence he is. He adds, "Le not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God; for God is in heaven, and thou upon earth, therefore let thy words be few." This plainly inculcates, how much it behoves us to have a reverent sense of the majesty and purity of the supreme searcher of hearts, and to be deeply humbled into a feeling of our inability and nothing∣ness, before we address him with our lips.</P>
<P>If it is not in man's power duly to prepare his own heart, and yet it is his indispensable duty deeply and reverently to worship the Author of his being in spirit and in truth, how necessary must an awful silence be, that he may know his soul prepared by the immediate hand of God to approach him acceptably! On the contrary, how inconsiderate, hasty, or presumptuous is the practice of uttering words to him, which the heart doth not understand, or of confessing a state it never sensibly experienced! Certainly, if we believe the Lord is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity with approbation, we must conclude, he is more jealous of his honour than to
<PB N="10" REF="019924_0060_0FE1A6CCE885EE90"/>accept of such dissimulation. Is not an humble, conscientious, silent waiting in submission, to be influenced and led by him, abundantly preferable in his sight? Then how much more the sighs and expressions that proceed from a real heart-affecting sense of his greatness and omnipresence, and of the lowness and unworthiness of the creature that consi∣ders itself as dust and ashes before him! Doth not such a weighty sense of our meanness and inability of ourselves to offer any thing pleasing to him, who is an infinite spirit superlatively glorious, unless he first condescend graciously to help our infirmities, and teach us to pray as we ought, discover more true regard, and real concern of heart, to offer up a spiri∣tual sacrifice that may be acceptable, through Jesus Christ the great Mediator, who never can intercede with the Father to accept an insincere hypocritical offering, a barely drawing near to him with the tongue, and honouring him with the lips, whilst the heart is insensible of his fear, and amused with other objects? Is it not more safe and rational to wait in silence upon the Lord, than thus to deceive our souls with sparks of our own kindling, warming vain and foolish self with a fire of its own lighting, instead of placing our expectation upon him, who alone can teach his people rightly to profit, and enable them to pray with the Spirit, and with a right understanding also?</P>
<P>There is an essential difference betwixt praying in reality as the spirit shall teach us, and praying in form as men and books advise us. Those who pray under the guidance of the Holy Spirit, pray with additi∣onal fervency, knowing their attention fixed on God alone, their understandings are opened into a true discerning of their spiritual wants, and their souls quickened to a lively, humble, sincere worship; wherein their spirits are refreshed, and gain strength
<PB N="11" REF="019924_0061_0FE1A6CE6ACCC1B0"/>in the Lord, and in the power of his might. On the other hand, men and books may furnish with fair seemings, and plausible expressions, but they cannot effect that brokenness of spirit, that contri∣tion of heart, and sensibility of soul which the Spirit of God gives. They may teach to say, Lord! Lord! whilst Satan rules in the will and affections, and carries the imaginations after divers vanities; for nothing less than the power of the spirit can subdue and chain down the carnal mind. How necessary then is an humble waiting in silence, truly to know what spirit we are of, before we offer any thing to the living God? Without this knowledge we must be liable to offer strange fire, which the Lord never commanded, like the sons of Aaron, who, through negligence having suffered the holy fire, divinely kindled, to go out, presented a strange fire of man's kindling, for which they suffered death. Ought not this expressive instance of divine displeasure against the presumptuous substitutions of men after their own wills, and in the place of God's appointment, to deter mankind from offering their own carnal conceptions and contrivances, instead of his inward and spiritual requirings? Ought not this considera∣tion to strike every one with a deep and awful sense, that something more is due to the great Jehovah, than those common, careless, unfelt modes of worship which too many are apt to satisfy themselves with; and more especially as he hath declared,<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Lev. x. 3.</NOTE> "I will be sanctified in them that come night me." How can he be sanctified in us, but as his own pure Spirit awfully prevails in the soul, puts it forth in humility, and influenceth the will and affections by its holy quickening energy?</P>
<P>If Christ is indeed our Lord, why are not we more seriously concerned to honour him in our
<PB N="12" REF="019924_0062_0FE1A6D408CAAFC8"/>hearts? If he is our master, why do we not so fear his displeasure, as to endeavour, with all diligence, to walk circumspectly, not as fools, inattentive to his leadings; but as wise, seeking to redeem the time, because the days are evil?</P>
<P>The Spirit, by the mouth of Zechariah, saith,<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Zech. ii. 13.</NOTE> "Be silent, O all flesh! before the Lord; for he is raised up out of his holy habitation." Is not a modest humble silence properly due to the presence of the King of kings, and Lord of lords? Doth it not bespeak more real and awful regard to his perfect holiness, wisdom and power, to wait for his Spirit to open our hearts and lips, before we attempt vocally to speak forth his praise, than to be hasty in uttering words without true knowledge before our all-seeing Judge? Then how approveable is the practice of solemn silent waiting, till we receive illumination and ability properly to worship the Almighty! Would the potentates of the earth think themselves treated with becoming reverence, should their subjects and servants immediately approach them with a multitude of words, and continue them the whole time they stand in their presence, instead of waiting silently to hear their pleasure, and receive their commands? How much less ought we to expect such behaviour is pleasing, or acceptable from us, to him who searches all hearts, and knows us better than we know ourselves; to whom we must be indebted for the true knowledge of every spiritual want, before we can have wisdom to ask aright according to his will!</P>
<P>When the prophet Isaiah was admitted, in a vision, to behold the glorious Majesty of God, he could only cry,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Isa. vi.</NOTE> "Woe is me!" till a live coal from the holy altar had touched his lips, and purged away his sin. What a deep reverence of his Maker, and
<PB N="13" REF="019924_0063_0FE1A6D844BF64A0"/>just abhorrence of self filled his humbled mind, when he was favoured with this awful sight of the supreme glory! How self-abasing were his sensations, and emphatical his expressions, when he cried, "Woe is me! for I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips! and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of Hosts!" How different is this heart-felt acknowledgment, proceeding from the powerful convictions of the Holy Spirit, to those dry, formal, unfelt words that come from the lips of bare nominal Christians! Notwithstanding every disciple hath not so large a portion of the Holy Spirit, as this great prophet had, yet every one is graciously favoured with a measure sufficient to render his offering spiritual and living.</P>
<P>We read, that after the ascension of Christ, his disciples<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Acts ii. 1, 4.</NOTE> "were all with one accord in one place, when they were filled with the Holy Ghost." Tho' the text doth not expressly say, they were waiting in silence for the promise of the Father, yet it appears as probable they were, as that they were not; for there is no mention of any vocal exercise amongst them at that time, before they were influenced thereunto by that peculiar communication and impulse of the Holy Ghost, whence "they began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance." The attention is certainly more likely to be fixed upon, and stayed in true watchfulness towards the Lord, and the mind more fitly prepared to receive the influence of his divine light and power, in silent waiting, than if agitated in a continual practice of running over a multitude of unfelt expressions.</P>
<P>David, by inspiration, personating the Most High, saith,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Psal. xlvi. 10.</NOTE> "Be still, and know that I am God!" The

Is not the carnal mind of man included in this prohibition? What is more likely to scatter and divert his attention from the right object, than thoughts, imaginations, and propensities of an earthly or sensual nature? What more dishonourable to the Lord of perfection and purity, than the busy forward actings of an unprepared and corrupt heart in spiritual things? What is more necessary to be silenced than that which is at enmity with God? What more becoming an humble dependent crea∣ture, sensible of the depravity of its nature, of its inability to do any good, and of the honour due to the presence of its Creator, than a deeply expressive solemn silence before him?</P>
<P>Our Lord Jesus Christ taught his disciples to avoid the practice of hypocrites,<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Mat. vi. 5, 6, 7.</NOTE> "Who love to pray standing in the synagogues, and in the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men." He also directed, "When ye pray, use not vain repeti∣tions, as the Heathen do, for they think that they shall be heard for their much speaking;" and indeed, what now makes a greater shew or figure in religion amongst many, than to use long and frequent prayers, and much formal devotion, as if their eye was more towards the praise of men than acceptance with God, and as if they gloried in empty appear∣ances? But what is the precept of Christ?<NOTE N="v" PLACE="foot">Ibid vi. 6.</NOTE> "When thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret, and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee openly." Doth not this teach us, that before we approach the Fountain of all wisdom, to shut out every thing that would amuse or divert the attention from the reverence due to the great object
<PB N="15" REF="019924_0065_0FE1A33999284EC0"/>of our adoration, the giver of every good and perfect gift? Can we be too solid, or feel our hearts, affections, and desires, too much gathered out of transitory things, into a humbling sense of the Divine Presence, when we apply ourselves to the solemn act of worshipping the Majesty on high?</P>
<P>Since waiting upon God in silence for renewed strength and spiritual wisdom, to lead our hearts, and direct our tongues in vocal prayer, or preaching, makes no ostentatious shew, but rather appears contemptible to the busy disposition and wisdom of vain man, it is not reasonable to suppose, that this self-denying practice should gain the approbation or praise of men; yet in must evidently tend to prevent that great and offensive hypocrisy, of drawing near to the Lord with the tongue, and worshipping him with the lips, whilst the heart is far from him. Can there be any frame more fit or proper for the poor soul, wherein to hear the still small voice of the true internal Shepherd, than that of an attentive and submissive silent waiting?</P>
<P>Waiting upon God is abundantly recommended in holy writ, and waiting in silence necessarily implied in order to hear his voice.<NOTE N="w" PLACE="foot">John <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></NOTE> "My sheep, saith the great Shepherd, hear my voice." When is the soul so capable of hearing the quickening language of his spirit, as in a state of silent watching for, and waiting to hear what he shall give it an understanding of, and engage it in, as its requisite and reasonable duty, by the illuminating virtue and enlivening power of his holy influence?</P>
<P>Our Lord forbids us to use vain repetitions; and what efficacy can those prayers have, which are made in the will, and by the contrivance of man, or that are uttered either from books, invention, or memory, whilst the heart neither feels the thing the mouth
<PB N="16" REF="019924_0066_0FE1A6E0EE832678"/>speaks, nor ever experienced what the tongue declares? What are these but vain repetitions and empty sounds? Whilst people remain insensible of the real condition of their souls, and of the true self-abasing fear of God, do they not seem to think they shall be heard for their much speaking, if they content themselves with the frequent repetition of long lifeless prayers, which they have not so much as weightily considered before they uttered them? Is this to worship the Father in spirit and in truth; the only worship instituted by Christ in this gospel-day, and therefore the only worship acceptable to God, who is a Spirit? Can this spiritual worship be performed till the soul feels its operation awfully to humble, engage, and impower the mind to this solemn act? What but the Spirit of the Redeemer is able to awaken and stir up the immortal soul, and endue it with wisdom and utterance, suitably to express itself, according to and under a due sense of its wants?</P>
<P>Christ in Spirit is the way, or leading power, to the Father; no man can come to the Father but by him. What is the reason why so many, who profess to be followers of Christ, complain of wandering thoughts, inattention, much coldness, deadness, and insensibility in prayer, and other duties and devotions? Is it not because they are too little dependent on the dictates of the Spirit, and believe not its sensible influence necessary to every religious act, nor wait for it to cleanse the thoughts of their hearts, and abili∣tate them to approach the Most High and Holy God in truth and righteousness? Is it not because such lean too much to their own unsubjected wisdom and understanding, to place their dependence on the Spirit, and to wait for its restraining heart-affecting power to lead them into all truth, and therefore are sent empty away, and no more truly refreshed or
<PB N="17" REF="019924_0067_0FE1A6E271A8CC90"/>benefited by their lifeless devotions, than he who dreams he eateth, but when he awakes, perceives he is yet empty? Thus they ask and receive not, because they ask amiss; not in a right frame, but in a lukewarm and unconcerned state of mind. The enemy is too strong for such worshippers, and carries their thoughts and imaginations after strange objects, while their lips only approach the Almighty. One secret prayer, or deep sigh from the wrestling soul, produced by the Eternal Spirit, is of more real service to it, issues from it with more fervour, prevails more effectually with the Father, and pro∣cures it more refreshment than ten thousand vain repetitions; because the virtue of the Spirit of the great Intercessor being in these prayers and sighs, they cannot but find acceptance.</P>
<P>Doth not the common complaint of wanderings in time of prayer, from those who oppose silent waiting for the divine assistance of the Spirit, to speak or pray according to the will of God, prove the necessity of such a practice, in order to worship the Father in spirit and in truth? Our blessed Redeemer saith,<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> "Your Father knoweth what things ye have need of before ye ask him." How requisite therefore is it, that he open our understand∣ings, shew us our true conditions, discover to us our spiritual wants, and enable us to present our petitions according to his will, before we can sensibly ask for the necessary supplies, or cry Abba, Father; and for this end, how incumbent it is upon us silently to wait for his immediate help and direction?</P>
<P>David faith,<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE> "Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with thy free Spirit: then (not before) will I teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted unto thee." This shews, he placed his dependence upon the renewed influence
<PB N="18" REF="019924_0068_0FE1A6E3F2981A48"/>of the Holy Spirit, and that he held no former experiences, however good in themselves, sufficient qualifications for divine service in the time present. He knew, that nothing short of a fresh supply from the Fountain of living virtue could properly enable him to preach to others; and therefore prayed,<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Psal. li. 15.</NOTE> "Open thou my lips, and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise."</P>
<P>The apostle Paul saith,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 26.</NOTE> "The spirit also helpeth our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered." By this just acknowledgment it appears, the exercise of a mind deeply affected is more than words can express, therefore it speaks to God in un∣utterable groans: a thing much despised and scoffed at by many professors in this age. We see however, the apostle was not ashamed to own it to be what himself and his brethren experienced to be true; which shews the sense they had of their own natural inability and blindness, and also their firm depen∣dence upon the Holy Spirit, without which they knew not what to pray for as they ought; and therefore found a necessity to wait for its renewals upon them, before they could either pray for them∣selves, or preach to others profitably, and with divine acceptance. How can we at this day presume to know what to pray for as we ought without the sensible help of the Holy Spirit, if this great apostle and his brethren did not? Yet, is there not ground for suspicion, from the common practice of professing Christians now, that they do not think themselves at a loss what to pray for acceptably; and therefore presumptuously offer their invented supplications, without due fear and caution, to him who looketh at the heart, and remain insensible of the necessity
<PB N="19" REF="019924_0069_0FE1A6E5A600F930"/>of feeling the Holy Spirit to disengage them from roving thoughts, and concerns of a temporal nature, and to communicate of that discerning wisdom and living power which is requisite to direct their hearts and tongues aright.</P>
<P>But, notwithstanding a previous waiting upon God is so much despised, the apostle intimates, that the groanings of the Spirit are effectual without vocal sounds; which proves there is an inward address deeper than the expression of words, which is heard and accepted of God. Let me add, that Jesus him∣self applied to the Father in this manner, when<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">John xi. 33.38.41.</NOTE> "He groaned in the Spirit twice," and afterwards lift up his eyes, and before he called Lazarus out of the grave, said, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me." This shews his fervent groans were accepted, and his request granted, without audible expressions; and doth not the compassionate Father still regard the groans begotten by the Spirit of his Son in the hearts of his followers? Indeed there is much efficacy in groans that arise from this living principle.</P>
<P>The apostle Paul saith,<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Rom. viii. 9. 11.</NOTE> "If any man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.—If the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit that dwelleth in you." When do Christians more need these quickenings than in their assemblies for divine worship; and how must they distinguish them, except they wait in silence? Is it an unwar∣rantable presumption, humbly to wait in expectation of the promised assistance, to enable us sensibly to worship freely, livingly, and powerfully, which cannot be, unless the Spirit of Christ is our helper? If these internal quickenings be the continued pri∣vilege of Christ's disciples, and if it is to the virtue
<PB N="20" REF="019924_0070_0FE1A6EE8D80D920"/>thereof that all our services owe their efficacy and acceptance, can it be right or safe to run before, and without that which is the very life of true prayer and preaching? If not, there is an absolute necessity for, and certainly great propriety in waiting patiently for it, in submissive silence, that the sacrifice may be of the Lord's preparing, and that it may be offered according to his will, under the immediate conduct of his own pure Spirit. Thus qualified, we pray with the Spirit, and with understanding also; which prayer must consequently profit and refresh the thirsty soul; and if a filent attention had neither any express command, nor example in scripture, it is necessarily implied in many parts of it, as well as in the nature of true spiritual worship.</P>
<P>Is not the Almighty a most pure and perfectly glorious being, dwelling in the light, whom no man can approach unto, but by the Spirit of the Medi∣ator? And is not man absolutely dependent on the merciful goodness and power of his Creator? and is it not reasonable that such a creature should be made deeply sensible to whom he must be indebted for all spiritual ability, as well as temporal favours, before he can approach the Sacred Presence with becoming reverence? And in what state is he so likely to be made sensible of this, as under an abstraction of mind from earthly cogitations and concerns, into a silent attention upon the omnipresent Spirit?</P>
<P>These things duly considered, is it just and reasonable to censure and despise any people for conscientiously waiting upon God in silence, and frequently falling into such an heart-engaging exer∣cise of spirit in his fear, as cannot often be uttered in words, and consequently must be experienced in silence? Who can seriously think, that he who saith,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Isa lxvi. 2.</NOTE> "To this man will I look, even to him that is poor,
<PB N="21" REF="019924_0071_0FE1A6F094F0DED0"/>and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at my word," will not hear and regard, when many hearts are collectively bowed before him under an unfeigned concern and travail of spirit; when the soul worships before him more deeply than can be expressed by lip or tongue? What are the finest words and fairest forms to him who respecteth not the outward shew, but the inward frame of the heart, if they do not convey the sincere feeling language thereof?</P>
<P>The apostle utterly disclaims all self-sufficiency:<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Cor <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>;</NOTE> "Not, saith he, that we are sufficient of ourselves, to think any thing as of ourselves, but our suffi∣ciency is of God, who also hath made us able ministers of the New Testament, not of the letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life." The virtue and excellence of the Christian religion is justly ascribed to the Holy Spirit. The same apostle declares,<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>.</NOTE> "We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power may be of God, and not of us." There∣fore Christ hath instituted no other worship under the new covenant, but that which is performed in spirit and in truth; and how can we perform this, till we have a sense of the spirit, and feel the virtue of its influence engaging our souls in truth to this spiritual worship? And how can we attain this feeling, without patiently waiting in silence for its powerful assistance?</P>
<P>If the primitive Christians were of themselves so insufficient to think any thing, or to point out to themselves their own line of duty according to the divine will, they certainly could not of themselves pray or preach to others consistent therewith, and therefore were obliged to wait for the renewals of light and ability from the Holy Spirit wherein their
<PB N="22" REF="019924_0072_0FE1A6F215A28F18"/>sufficiency was. If the case was such with them, is it less so with us? It certainly is not; for we are under the same dispensation, and altogether as insuf∣ficient of ourselves as they could be. It is therefore now as requisite for us, as it could then be for them, to wait for divine direction and help, to give us a true sense both of our state and duty, and to enable us to the performance of it; and how can we reason∣ably expect to receive the assistance of the Spirit, but by humbly watching, and waiting in silence for its appearance and operation in our souls?</P>
<P>The heavenly influence of the Holy Spirit is the very life and glory of the gospel dispensation, and is now as surely to be distinguished by experienced minds, as it was in the primitive age; else why was it promised to abide as the guide and leader of true believers; and why doth the apostle exhort<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 18.</NOTE> "To pray always with all supplication in the spirit, and to watch thereunto with all perseverance?"</P>
<P>We read, that after the opening of the seventh seal,<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Rev. viii. 1.</NOTE> "There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour." If silent worship is such an absurdity, as to be made the subject of ridicule, how came it to be found and allowed of in heaven? Was not the great God then obeyed, and adored there as profoundly as when they sang hallelujahs? If so, why should an awful silent waiting upon him be treated, by any, as unprofitable and inconsistent with divine worship? Why should any prefer the modes and forms their own hearts have devised, or ignorantly espoused, to a solemn submissive waiting in silence, to know the true state of the soul, and to receive the blessed counsel of the Spirit, before they proceed vocally to address the Dread of nations, or presume to preach as in his name, and declare any thing as his will, whose all-seeing eye is continually upon them?</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="019924_0073_0FE1A6F3B645D450"/>
Elihu plainly expresseth,<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Job. xxxii. 8.</NOTE> "There is a spirit in man, and the inspiration of the Almighty giveth them understanding." When is the most likely time to be made sensible of this inspiration? That in which the mind is attentively waiting upon him in a profound and passive silence; or that wherein it is amused and busied with a multitude of words and ideas, on various subjects? What avails praying or preaching without this communicated understand∣ing? Can it be any better than sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal? When people presume to pray without a sense of their real wants, and confess a state to the omniscient Being they never truly felt, and also petition for those spiritual favours and divine sensations they seek not to feel, do they not act as if they concluded, he will accept of an insincere devotion, and that he is not so jealous of his honour, as the sacred writings declare he is?</P>
<P>Besides the many scriptures in favour of a patient dependence upon, and silent waiting for the quick∣ening power of the Spirit, to give us a true sense of our wants, and bring to our remembrance the great obligations we are under to the mercy and goodness of God, there is also a cloud of witnesses, who have experimentally profited, and edified much more in silence than they ever did before they were in the practice of it, who, I believe, can say in truth and righteousness, that when the just judgments of an offended God were heavy upon them for transgression, and their tribulations were inexpressible, through strong heart-breaking convictions of the exceeding sinfulness of sin, and they lay groaning under it daily in great wretchedness, without finding any help or deliverance from all their own workings, their many and long prayers, and self-righteousness; then it pleased the merciful Redeemer to open a way for
<PB N="24" REF="019924_0074_0FE1A6F9AF35A9B0"/>them gradually into humble stillness, and to reveal his Son in them, as the precious Lamb of God, who taketh away the Sin of the world. This blessed discovery raised them out of their distresses, and enabled them to say, "My soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit rejoiceth in God my Saviour; for he hath regarded the low estate of his servant." This inclined them to sit willingly at his feet in silence, and gladly to receive his pouring forth of the wine and oil into their bleeding wounds, till he healed their backslidings, and forgave their trans∣gressions. For,<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">I John i. 9.</NOTE> "If we confess our sins (from a real abhorrence of sin) he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness." Who can declare the sweet conso∣lation such have felt, who believe in his name as sufficient to purge the conscience from dead works, and enable them to serve him in newness of life? Truly, they have experienced that testimony of David fulfilled in their own hearts,<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Psal xl. 1, 2.</NOTE> "I waited patiently, saith he, for the Lord, and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry. He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock." Thus they were brought out of darkness into light, and came to know, that whereas they had been spiritually blind, now, by the grace of God, they had received their sight, and by this power of discerning, learn not to trust to themselves, or their own works, but atten∣tively to watch, and silently to wait, both to hear what the Spirit saith to the churches, and what it requires of them in their own particulars, that by its heavenly power every thought might be brought into the obedience of Christ. Thus they have been taught, and do certainly know, that no man can come to the Father, but by him; nor that any can
<PB N="25" REF="019924_0075_0FE1A6FB47CC6A08"/>sufficiently see their own sins, truly repent, effectu∣ally cry for deliverance, or rejoice in his salvation, but as his saving power is exercised in them, and their minds become subjected thereunto. This is the power they have learnt to wait for, and depend upon; in which dependent state they meet with the Lord as a quickening Spirit, hear him instruct them with convincing clearness, and feel his presence to impart fresh life and strength to their souls; for he still speaks in his spiritual manifestation, as he did in his bodily appearance, with divine authority, and as never man spoke, and is the author of eternal salvation to all that obey him. These can experi∣mentally say, that he is come to teach his people himself, and that he is made unto them wisdom, to direct their steps in the way to the kingdom; right∣eousness, to clothe their spirits; their sanctification and complete redemption; as they are concerned not only to receive him in the beginning as their Lord and Saviour, but also to grow up and persevere in the power of the Spirit, earnestly desiring to be rooted and built up in its divine nature, and established in the true faith. The Lord alone can profitably apply the precious promises to the poor soul, as he leads it through the various progressive states to which the promises belong; by whose guidance his faithful followers are brought to escape the corruptions that are in the world, and measure∣ably to become partakers of the divine nature.</P>
<P>Christ dwells in the hearts of these by faith, as the holy, powerful, appointed minister of the sanctuary and true tabernacle, which God hath pitched, and not man. He not only teacheth infal∣libly and convincingly, but also raiseth a hunger and thirst after a closer union with himself, and a fuller possession and enjoyment of his everlasting righte∣ousness. Those who have attained this experience,
<PB N="26" REF="019924_0076_0FE1A6FCC9DF7F10"/>cannot but esteem the time well spent in silently waiting for his instruction what to pray for, and that he may open their understandings to discern their present duty, and how to apply the sacred writings to real profit, and also to commemorate what great things he has mercifully done for their needy souls, both without and within them. This frequently melts them into tears of unaffected contrition, and humble gratitude; in which state they can adore his goodness, and put up their petitions without a prayer-book, and often without any vocal sound; for he is then known to be in his temple, and the earthly part is in perfect silence before him. What sober person, who considers how awful a thing it is to worship the great Jehovah in spirit and truth, can lightly censure or disapprove of such a silent depen∣dence on his power, to help the poor creature under its manifold infirmities?<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Psal. xxxvii. 7, and xxvii. 14.</NOTE> "Rest in the Lord, saith David, or as in the margin, Be silent to the Lord, and wait patiently for him; wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and he shall strengthen thine heart. Wait, I say, on the Lord."</P>

ROBERT BARCLAY, in his Apology for the true Christian Divinity, as held forth by the people called Quakers, has wrote so clearly on the subject in his eleventh proposition, that a few quotations from this author may serve to illustrate the fore∣going reasons, and confirm the testimonies of many experimental witnesses on the subject, and profitableness of solemn silence.</P>
<P>IN his proposition on worship, in sect. 6. he has these remarks: <Q>We judge it the duty of all to be diligent in the assembling of themselves toge∣ther, and when assembled, the great work of one and all ought to be to wait upon God; and returning out of their own thoughts and imagi∣nations, to feel the Lord's presence, and know a gathering into his name indeed, where he is in the midst, according to his promise. And as every one is thus gathered, and so met together inwardly in their spirits, as well as outwardly in their persons, there the secret power and virtue of life is known to refresh the soul, and the pure motions and breathings of God's spirit are felt to arise; from which, as words of declaration, prayers or praises arise, the acceptable worship is known, which edifies the church, and is well-pleasing to God. And no man here limits the Spirit of God, nor bringeth forth his own conned and gathered stuff; but every one puts that forth which the Lord puts into their hearts: and it is uttered forth not in man's will and wisdom, but in the evidence and demonstration of the spirit and of power. Yea, though there be not a word spoken, yet is the true spiritual worship performed, and the body of Christ edified; yea, it may, and hath often fallen out among us, that divers meetings
<PB N="28" REF="019924_0078_0FE1A7052A2BC6C0"/>have past without one word; and yet our souls have been greatly edified and refreshed, and our hearts wonderfully overcome with the secret sense of God's power and spirit, which, without words, hath been ministered from one vessel to another. This is indeed strange and incredible to the mere natural and carnally-minded man, who will be apt to judge all time lost where there is not something spoken that is obvious to the outward senses; and therefore I shall insist a little upon this subject, as one that can speak from a certain experience, and not by mere hearsay, of this wonderful and glorious dispensation; which hath so much the more of the wisdom and glory of God in it, as it is contrary to the nature of man's spirit, will, and wisdom.</Q></P>
<P>He also in sect. 7. on silent waiting on God, expresses himself thus: <Q>For many thus principled, meeting together in the pure fear of the Lord, did not apply themselves presently to speak, pray, or sing, &amp;c. being afraid to be found acting forwardly in their own wills, but each made it their work to retire inwardly to the measure of grace in themselves, not being only silent as to words, but even abstaining from all their own thoughts, imaginations, and desires; so watching in a holy dependence upon the Lord, and meet∣ing together not only outwardly in one place, but thus inwardly in one Spirit, and in one name of Jesus, which is his power and virtue, they come thereby to enjoy and feel the arisings of this life, which, as it prevails in each particular, becomes as a flood of refreshment, and overspreads the whole meeting: for man, and man's part and wisdom, being denied and chained down in every individual, and God exalted, and his grace in dominion in the heart; thus his name comes to
<PB N="29" REF="019924_0079_0FE1A706ADE5EC78"/>be one in all, and his glory breaks forth, and covers all; and there is such a holy awe and reverence upon every soul, that if the natural part should arise in any, or the wise part, or what is not one with the life, it would presently be chained down and judged out. And when any are, through the breaking forth of this power, constrained to utter a sentence of exhortation or praise, or to breathe to the Lord in prayer, then all are sensible of it;<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Prov. xxvii. 19.</NOTE> for the life in them answers to it, as in water face answereth to face. This is that divine and spiritual worship, which the world neither knoweth nor understandeth, which the vulture's eye seeth not into. Yet many and great are the advantages which my soul, with many others, hath tasted of hereby, and which would be found of all such as would seriously apply themselves hereunto: for, when people are gathered thus together, not merely to hear men, nor depend upon them, but all are inwardly taught<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Isai. x. 20, and xxvi. 3.</NOTE> to stay their minds upon the Lord, and wait for his appearance in their hearts; thereby the forward working of the spirit of man is stayed and hindered from mixing itself with the worship of God.—</Q></P>
<P>In section 15. after having described the true worship in spirit established by Christ, and clearly proved the necessity and advantage of it, he proceeds thus: <Q>He hath also instituted an inward and spiritual worship: so that God now tieth not his people to the temple of Jerusalem, nor yet unto outward ceremonies and observation; but taketh the heart of every Christian for a temple to dwell in; and there immediately appeareth, and giveth him directions how to serve him in any outward
<PB N="30" REF="019924_0080_0FE1A70830A50C78"/>acts. Since, as Christ argueth, God is a Spirit, he will now be worshipped in the Spirit, where he reveals himself, and dwelleth with the contrite in heart. Now, since it is the heart of man that now is become the temple of God, in which he will be worshipped, and no more in particular outward temples, since, as blessed Stephen said, out of the prophet, to the professing Jews of old, The Most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands. As before the glory of the Lord descended to fill the outward temple, it behoved to be purified and cleansed, and all polluted stuff removed out of it; yea, and the place for the tabernacle was overlaid with gold, the most precious and cleanest of metals; so also before God be worshipped in the inward temple of the heart, it must also be purged of its own filth, and all its own thoughts and imaginations, that so it may be fit to receive the Spirit of God, and to be actuated by it. And doth not this directly lead us to that inward silence, of which we have spoken, and exactly pointed out? And further, this worship must be in truth; intimating, that this spiritual worship, thus actuated, is only and properly a true worship,</Q>—</P>
<P>"Franciscus Lambertus," as quoted by Robert Barclay, in sect. 18. speaketh well, tract. 5. of "prophecy, chap. 3. saying, <Q>Where are they now that glory in their inventions, who say, A fine invention! A fine invention! This they call invention, which themselves have made up; but what have the faithful to do with such kind of invention? It is not figments, nor yet inventions, that we will have, but things that are solid, invincible, eternal, and heavenly; not which men have invented, but which God hath revealed: for if we believe the scriptures, our invention
<PB N="31" REF="019924_0081_0FF1A709B39926F8"/>profiteth nothing, but to provoke God to our ruin. And afterwards,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is not intended by us to adopt the sentiment of a liberty to determine or choose the text; that, as well as the exposition, ought to be left to the dictates of the Holy Spirit. See the whole section in R. B's Apology.</NOTE> Beware (saith he) that thou determine not precisely to speak what before thou hast meditated, whatsoever it be; for though it be lawful to determine the text which thou art to expound, yet not at all the interpretation; lest if thou so dost, thou take from the Holy Spirit that which is his, to wit, to direct thy speech, that thou mayest prophesy in the name of the Lord, void of all learning, meditation, and experience, and as if thou hadst studied nothing at all, committing thy heart, thy tongue, and thyself wholly unto his Spirit, and trusting no∣thing to thy former studying or meditation; but saying with thyself, in great confidence of the divine promise, The Lord will give a word with much power unto those that preach the gospel. But, above all things, be careful thou follow not the manner of hypocrites, who have written almost word for word what they are to say, as if they were to repeat some verses upon a theatre, having learned all their preaching as they do that act tragedies. And afterwards, when they are in the place of prophesying, pray the Lord to direct their tongue; but in the mean time, shutting up the way of the Holy Spirit, they determine to say nothing but what they have written. O unhappy kind of prophets, yea, and truly cursed, which depend not upon God's Spirit, but upon their own writings or meditation! Why prayest thou to the Lord thou false prophet, to give thee his Holy Spirit, by which thou mayest speak things profitable, and yet thou repellest the Spirit? Why preferrest thou thy meditation or study to
<PB N="32" REF="019924_0082_0FE1A711431F9F20"/>the Spirit of God? otherwise, why committest thou not thyself to the Spirit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>Sect. 22. That there is a necessity of this inward retirement of the mind as previous to prayer, that the Spirit may be felt to draw there∣unto, appears, for that in most of those places where prayer is commanded, watching is prefixed thereunto, as necessary to go before, as Mat. xxiv. 42. Mark xiii. 33. and xiv. 38. Luke xxi. 36. from which it is evident, that this watching was to go before prayer. Now to what end is this watching, or what is it, but a waiting to feel God's Spirit to draw unto prayer, that so it may be done acceptably? For since we are to "<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Eph. vi. 18.</NOTE> pray always in the spirit, and cannot pray of ourselves without it, acceptably, this watching must be for this end recommended to us, as preceding prayer, that we may watch and wait for the seasonable time to pray, which is when the Spirit moves thereunto.</Q></P>
