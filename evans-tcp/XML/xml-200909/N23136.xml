<HEAD>A POEM.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>AS the rude Zemblian views with anxious eyes</L>
<L>The sun fast rolling from his wintry skies,</L>
<L>While gathering clouds the shaded vaults deform,</L>
<L>And hollow winds announce the impending storm,</L>
<L>His anguish'd soul recoils with wild affright,</L>
<L>From the dread horrors of the tedious night;</L>
<L>Such fears alarm'd—such gloom o'ercast each mind,</L>
<L>When WASHINGTON his sacred trust resign'd,</L>
<L>And open'd to his much lov'd country's view,</L>
<L>The instructive page which bid the long adieu.</L>
<L>So erst <HI>Nunnides,</HI> of prophetic tongue,</L>
<L>Chief, victor, seer, to Juda's list'ning throng,</L>
<L>Gave his last blessings: So long ages since,</L>
<L>Mild Solon and the stern Laconian prince,</L>
<L><PB N="3" REF="030579_0003_0FE7E93DE1291ED8"/>
Those boasts of fame, their parting counsels gave,</L>
<L>When worn with toil they sought the peaceful grave.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>COLUMBIANS! long preserve that peerless page,</L>
<L>Stamp'd with the precepts of your warrior-sage;</L>
<L>In all your archives be the gift enroll'd,</L>
<L>Suspend it to your walls encas'd in gold;</L>
<L>Bid schools recite it, let the priestly train</L>
<L>Chant it on festal days, nor deem the task profane;</L>
<L>When round your knees your infant offspring throng,</L>
<L>To join the matin prayer or evening song,</L>
<L>Those rites perform'd, invite them to attend</L>
<L>The farewel counsels of their good <HI>old friend,</HI></L>
<L>And say, he left you, as his last bequest,</L>
<L>These golden rules to make a nation blest.</L>
<L>O land, thrice blest, if to thy interest wise,</L>
<L>Thy Senates learn this precious boon to prize;</L>
<L>While guilty Europe's blood-stain'd empires fall,</L>
<L>While Heaven incens'd, lets loose the infuriate Gaul,</L>
<L>Thy States in phalanx firm, a sacred band,</L>
<L>Safe from the mighty wreck, unmov'd shall stand:</L>
<L>But if—may Heaven avert that shameful day!</L>
<L>By base intrigues or factions led astray,</L>
<L>With servile fondness for some foreign state,</L>
<L><PB N="4" REF="030579_0004_0FE7E9A165170690"/>
We join their quarrels and espouse their hate,</L>
<L>Thenceforth farewel to dignity and fame,</L>
<L>For Independence dwindles to a name.</L>
<L>Would those who counsel kings these rules attend,</L>
<L>Romantic wish! for kings have ne'er a friend:</L>
<L>But were these rules on royal minds impress'd,</L>
<L>Monarchs might reign, and subjects would be blest;</L>
<L>Dantons and Robespierres had died unknown,</L>
<L>And the mild CAPET still had grac'd a throne,</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Behold the man! ye crown'd and ermin'd train,</L>
<L>And learn from him the royal art to reign:</L>
<L>No guards surround him, or his walks infest,</L>
<L>No cuirass meanly shields his noble breast;</L>
<L>His the defence which despots ne'er can find,</L>
<L>The love, the prayers, the interests of mankind.</L>
<L>Ask ye what spoils his far fam'd arms have won,</L>
<L>What cities sack'd, what hapless realms undone?</L>
<L>Tho' MONMOUTH'S field supports no vulgar fame,</L>
<L>Tho' captur'd YORK shall long preserve his name,</L>
<L>I quote not these—a nobler scene behold,</L>
<L>Wide cultur'd plains, fast ripening into gold!</L>
<L>There, as his toil, the cheerful peasant plies,</L>
<L>New marts are opening, and new spires arise;</L>
<L>Here commerce smiles, and there <HI>en groupe</HI> are seen,</L>
<L><PB N="5" REF="030579_0005_0FE7EA07D0EAFA78"/>
The useful arts, and those of sprightlier mein:</L>
<L>To cheer the whole, the Muses tune the lyre,</L>
<L>And INDEPENDENCE leads the white rob'd choir.</L>
<L>Trophies like these, to vulgar minds unknown,</L>
<L>Were sought and priz'd by WASHINGTON alone.</L>
<L>From these, with all his country's honors crown'd,</L>
<L>As sage in councils as in arms renown'd;</L>
<L>All of a piece, and faithful to the last,</L>
<L>Great in this action as in all the past,</L>
<L>He turns—and urges as his last request,</L>
<L>Remote from power, his weary head to rest.</L>
<L>ILLUSTRIOUS MAN, <HI>Adieu!</HI>—yet ere we part,</L>
<L>Forgive our factions, which have wrung thy heart;</L>
<L>Still with indulgent eyes thy country see,</L>
<L>Whose ceaseless prayers ascend the Heavens for <HI>Thee,</HI></L>
<L>Go, midst the shades of tranquil VERNON stray,</L>
<L>In vain attempt to shun the piercing ray</L>
<L>Of circumambient glory, till refin'd</L>
<L>All that could clog to earth the heaven-lent mind,</L>
<L>Then soar triumphant to the blest abodes,</L>
<L>And join those Chiefs whom virtue rais'd to GODS.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>YE who have fought in Freedom's sacred cause,</L>
<L><PB N="6" REF="030579_0006_0FE7EA2C2288E588"/>
Who grace our Senates, or expound our laws,</L>
<L>Freemen, who deem your country's honors dear,</L>
<L>Indulge the Muse, and lend a patient ear:</L>
<L>Say, if on you the rights of suffrage wait,</L>
<L>Whom hail we next as FATHER of the STATE?</L>
<L>To each hath Heaven peculiar gifts assign'd,</L>
<L>And men, like stars, to certain spheres confin'd;</L>
<L>In paths excentric few allow'd to stray,</L>
<L>Drawing a splendid train and bright'ning all the way.</L>
<L>Saturnine souls, who think and move by rule,</L>
<L>Excel in grave debate, and reasonings cool;</L>
<L>Impetuous minds, of more impassion'd form,</L>
<L>"Ride in the whirlwind and direct the storm."</L>
<L>Hence these in councils, those in arms excel,</L>
<L>But few indeed are those who govern well;</L>
<L>For in his breast who sways the rod of state,</L>
<L>Must centre ev'ry gift supremely great:</L>
<L>And as the stars which gild the vault of night,</L>
<L>Unnumber'd pour effulgence on the sight,</L>
<L>So Chiefs and Senators in crowds abound,</L>
<L>But rare as comets <HI>Washington's</HI> are found.</L>
<L>Is there a man thro' thrice ten years well tried,</L>
<L>Who ne'er has crouch'd or meanly chang'd his side,</L>
<L><PB N="7" REF="030579_0007_0FE7EA30CD7F2788"/>
Ardent and foremost in his country's cause,</L>
<L>The friend of order and of equal laws,</L>
<L>Who views with stern contempt a clam'rous throng?</L>
<L>Strife in their heart, and freedom on their tongue;</L>
<L>A whiffling tribe who at their leader's nod,</L>
<L>Would sell their souls, their country or their GOD;</L>
<L>Who, had they liv'd in Jove's impartial reign,</L>
<L>Had join'd the giants, and enthron'd a <HI>Paine.</HI></L>
<L>Is there a man, in whose capacious mind,</L>
<L>A MURRAY, LOCKE and CHATHAM live combin'd;</L>
<L>Who joins to all that men or books have taught,</L>
<L>The fire of genius and the force of thought?</L>
<L>Is there a man, who in these changeful days,</L>
<L>Unaw'd by censure, unallur'd by praise,</L>
<L>True to his aim, and obstinately good,</L>
<L>While factions rag'd, unmov'd as Atlas stood?</L>
<L>Whose ancient virtues Stoics might revere,</L>
<L>And Rome reviv'd, behold her <HI>Censor</HI> here;</L>
<L>Such, as ere Grecian spoils her temples grac'd,</L>
<L>And solid virtue sunk to attic taste.</L>
<L>Should such a man preside the land were blest—</L>
<L>Advert your eyes, and ADAMS stands confest.</L>
<L>Fir'd at the name, enraptur'd fancy flies,</L>
<L>Old time rolls back, and years long past arise;</L>
<L>To memory fresh unfolds the solemn scene,</L>
<L><PB N="8" REF="030579_0008_0FE7EA3358EC3408"/>
Columbia's Sires in high Divan convene,</L>
<L>Of dread concerns, commission'd to consult,</L>
<L>And chains or empires wait the grand result:</L>
<L>Full in the front I see the Patriot stand,</L>
<L>All fire his eye, all energy his hand—</L>
<L>Such graceful majesty round Tully shone,</L>
<L>When Rome's proud master trembled on his throne.</L>
<L>"Ye guardian powers of eloquence divine,</L>
<L>"Prepare each soul to grasp the grand design!</L>
<L>"Inspire my tongue the glorious cause to plead,</L>
<L>"Impel each hand to sign the deathless deed"—</L>
<L>He ceas'd—Assent remurmur'd thro' the throng,</L>
<L>"While INDEPENDENCE thunder'd from his tongue."</L>
