<HEAD>A REPLY TO Mr. <HI>Joseph Fish.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALL must allow that to know, the true limits of the church of Christ, what are his institutions, and who have a right to them, are matters of no small impor∣tance; tho' many have complained, and not without reason, that in many of the controver∣sies about them in our day, the nature of the subject has not been so closely attended to as it ought, but that many things have been intro∣duced which tend to mislead or perplex the en∣quiring mind, rather than to enlighten it. And as I shall have occasion before I close this dis∣course to give the particular reasons of my writ∣ing upon this subject, I desire to refer the reader thereto for his own satisfaction, and would pro∣ceed directly to the argument in hand.</P>
<P>In 1767 Mr. <HI>Joseph Fish</HI> published nine ser∣mons from Mat. 16.18. in which he tried to prove, that those called <HI>standing churches</HI> in New-England, are built upon the Rock, and from
<PB N="4" REF="012655_0003_0F8BBEDC87878938"/>thence to shew what great evils they are guilty of who have withdrawn from them. In this proceeding many were so fully persuaded that he had injured both the truth and people of God, that I was prevailed with to publish an axamina∣tion of those sermons in 1768.</P>
<P>Against which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has endeavoured to vin∣dicate himself and his sermons, in a piece intitled, <HI>The Examiner Examined,</HI> printed 1771; which, for reasons hereafter to be given, I think expedient to make some reply to, under the following heads.</P>
<P N="1">I. Of the <HI>matter</HI> of the gospel church.</P>
<P>This is the capital point of our dispute. I concurred with Mr. <HI>F.</HI> that the <Q>Truth which Peter confessed, or the person of Christ, of whom this confession is made, is the ROCK upon which Jesus Christ resolves to build his church; and that Peter was one of those <HI>lively stones,</HI> or precious <HI>materials</HI> of that building.</Q> And when he observed from Deut. 29.10, &amp;c. <Q>That children, even infants were always reckoned a part of that body or church, which the Lord gathered in Abraham's family,</Q> I readily concurred with that also; but when he said, <Q>Is it not altogether reasonable to suppose that the Christian church is made up of the <HI>same materials,</HI> that the Jewish church was?</Q> my answer was, No by no means, because God has said the contrary; to prove which I referred him to ser. 31.31, 32. Heb. 8.5, &amp;c.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Let the reader observe, that through this discourse, Ser. stands for Mr. <HI>F</HI>'s Sermons: Ex. for my Examination of them; and only p. with figures, for his last piece.</NOTE> Ex. p. 11, 12.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="012655_0004_0F8BBEDD44E03310"/>
Now in reply Mr. <HI>F.</HI> charges me a number of times with entirely mistaking his meaning, for no better reason that I can see, than only because I dont agree with it. At length he comes to the point in hand, and says if he understands me, he thinks my meaning is, <Q>That the covenant which God made with Israel when he brought them up out of Egypt, was the covenant which took in parents and children, and made them the <HI>materials</HI> of the Jewish church; but the new covenant which he would make with them afterwards is essentially different from that covenant; and therefore there must be an essential difference in the materials of the churches, Jewish and Christian.</Q> p. 27.— —True, that is my meaning; and what has he produced against it? Why he first tries to reduce it to this absurdity; that I hold the ma∣terials of the <HI>visible</HI> church to be all gracious persons, and yet own that hypocrites do some∣times <HI>creep</HI> into it; which consequently puts an end to the distinction between <HI>visible</HI> and <HI>invisible.</HI></P>
<P><Q>These, says he, are his sentiments so far as I can see any thing of his meaning.</Q> Yet I did repeatedly answer this very objection, Ex. p. 57, 95. And Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has a remark upon a page in which I observed that, These ministers <HI>confound</HI> the constitution of the Jewish and Christian chur∣ches together, and shuffle and shift from one to the other as occasion suits, and then charge us with not distinguishing between the <HI>visible</HI> and <HI>in∣visible</HI> church. They allow that the invisible church contains none but the <HI>first born which are written in heaven,</HI> Heb. 12.23. but they would have the visible church contain abundance more;
<PB N="6" REF="012655_0005_0F8BBEDE2E01C560"/>and fly to the Jews, to parables, and to hypo∣crites to support their notions. Whereas the proper notion of visible is the making <HI>manifest</HI> what was before invisible: hence says Paul, <HI>With the heart man believeth, and with the mouth con∣fession is made;</HI> therefore an <HI>outward shew</HI> of what is not <HI>invisibly real,</HI> is <HI>hypocrisy.</HI> The only reason why any get into the visible church who are not born again, is not owing to the <HI>rule,</HI> but to the <HI>imperfection</HI> of men in acting upon it. Hence old Mr. <HI>Shepard,</HI> in answer to this question, <HI>Do not hypocrites and no true members of Christ</HI> creep in? Says, <Q>Yes; but if they could have been known to be such they ought to be KEPT OUT; and when they are known, they are orderly to be CAST OUT. Mat. 25.1, 2 Tim. 3.5. Rev. 2.20. Tit. 3.10.</Q> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His sum of the Christian Religion. p. 25. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>These are my words; and I did hope that at least the sentence of one of our learned fathers who composed the <HI>Cambridge</HI> platform, would have had some weight with Mr. <HI>F.</HI> but no; that old beaten road must be kept, let fathers or children be trampled upon ever so much, yea and his eyes are so dim that he says, "I dont see why Mr. <HI>B.</HI> <Q>may not just as well say of Paul and his brethren in the ministry, as he does of me and mine:—for who of all writers or preachers, does so much as Paul and the other apostles, at connecting the Jewish and Christian churches together; shewing that the latter springs out of the former; or rather, is but a continuation of the <HI>same</HI> church?</Q> p. 116. And are there no means to help our authors eye-sight? Yes;
<PB N="7" REF="012655_0006_0F8BBEDEC344AB80"/>at the top of the same page he has helped mine, and I cant but hope to requite his kindness in the same way. I had quoted 2 Tim. 3.5, but was so short-sighted as to write, THE <HI>form of godliness,</HI> instead of A <HI>form.</HI> This he corrects, and says, <Q>There is THE form of <HI>sound words,</HI> which we are to <HI>hold fast;</HI> and so THE form of divine service which <HI>God</HI> has instituted to be religiously observed, and not trifled with. And there is A form of godliness which <HI>man</HI> invents and sets up, and so not binding to christians, widely different from THE form which is of God.</Q></P>
<P>I heartly thank Mr. <HI>F.</HI> for this correction, and that for two reasons; one is because I am glad to get rid of my own mistakes; the other is because I hope to do him and others good by it, and for that end request attention to the follow∣ing particulars.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. THE form of <HI>sound words,</HI> calls the cove∣nant that constituted Abraham's household into a church, <HI>The covenant of circumcision.</HI> Act. 7.8. But A form that man has invented calls it, <HI>The covenant of grace.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>2 THE form of sound words, calls Abraham's two sons, with the mothers who bare them, an <HI>allegory</HI> of the TWO covenants, one of which the <HI>Jewish,</HI> the other the <HI>Christian</HI> church stood in. Gal. 4.22—31. But the words of mans invention, and which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> follows, say, <Q>The covenant that made the Jews the church of God is essentially the <HI>same</HI> in all ages,</Q> p. 39.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The form of sound words shews that circumcision was a <HI>sign</HI> of Christ's death, and of an inward change, Col. 2.11. and that as Abraham had this change, and by faith
<PB N="8" REF="012655_0007_0F8BBEE38562B150"/><HI>saw</HI> and <HI>embraced</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">John 8.56. Heb. 11.13.</NOTE> Christ <HI>before</HI> circumcision was instituted, it was a <HI>seal</HI> of the <HI>faith that he had,</HI> when he was in <HI>uncircumcision,</HI> Rom. 4.10, 11. But man's wisdom asserts that it was a <HI>seal</HI> to that church in general, tho' it is never called so in the sacred oracles.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. From Abraham's faith in Christ, <HI>before</HI> circumcision and other rites of the law were appointed, the apostle proves that his title to be <HI>heir of the world,</HI> so that all believers should be called <HI>his children,</HI> was not thro' the Jewish covenant, but a <HI>better</HI> covenant, establish∣ed upon <HI>better promises,</HI> Rom. 4.12, 13. Gal. 3.16, 17. Heb. 8.6. Yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> holds both cove∣nants to be essentially the same. He allows a circumstantial difference, and that the gospel dispensation is <Q>more spiritual, simple, and free from outward ceremonies.</Q> p. 35. More <HI>spiritual</HI> as to ordinances, but <HI>carnal</HI> as ever in materials; for he declares that <Q>There is no∣thing in the constitution of this new covenant, that necessarily requires a <HI>change</HI> of the <HI>mate∣rials</HI> of the church.</Q> p. 36. Tho' THE form of sound words, plainly makes so great change in the materials, as there is between the children of Abraham's flesh, and the <HI>children of God;</HI> and tells us that those of his seed which the Gentiles were grafted in among, were a <HI>remnant accord∣ing to the election of grace;</HI> the <HI>rest</HI> being <HI>broken off</HI> because of <HI>unbelief,</HI> and those who <HI>stood,</HI> it was <HI>by faith,</HI> Rom. 9.8, and 11.5, 17, 20. There∣fore,</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. The greatest difference between the cove∣nant of circumcision, that God made with Abra∣ham, and the new covenant which he made with
<PB N="9" REF="012655_0008_0F8BBEE5D3750888"/>his believing posterity, lay in the <HI>materials</HI> of the church. The first of his seed who was cir∣cumcised was an unbeliever; and when that co∣venant was renewed, and the ordinance of the passover was added, in <HI>the day</HI> that Israel came out of Egypt, there was also a precept given, that when a <HI>stranger</HI> would join with that church, <HI>let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it.</HI> Exod. 12.48. But God says, the new covenant with the believing He∣brews, is <HI>not according</HI> to the covenant he made with their fathers <HI>in that day;</HI> and the special excellency of this new covenant is, that <HI>all shall know him from the least to the greatest.</HI> Heb. 8.8—11. Here note; Ishmael did not know God tho' he was thirteen years old when he was con∣stituted one of the materials of that church, but it would not have answered so well, to have placed the opposition there, because Abraham had no precept given him to admit <HI>strangers</HI> by <HI>housholds;</HI> that was given in <HI>the day</HI> they came out of Egypt. So that as I said before, I cannot conceive it possible, for words to express more plainly than these do, that there is an essential difference be∣tween the materials, as well as the forms of the two churches.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>And what has Mr. <HI>F.</HI> said against this? Why he has taken up much time to prove, that the covenant of grace was always the same, and that God has brought some to know him in all ages (which I never denied) and then he both adds to, and takes from the word of God; and by that time he has got so bewildered, as to deny his knowing any thing of what himself had transcrib∣ed just above. This you will say is very strange.
<PB N="10" REF="012655_0009_0F8BBEE6ED541C58"/>It is so, but no more strange than true. I have already proved that the word of truth calls the covenant which formed Abraham's houshold in∣to a church, The covenant of circumcision; but Mr. <HI>F.</HI> takes this away, and <HI>adds</HI> the name <HI>grace</HI> to it, which is not put to it in the bible; and reasons upon it till he says, <Q>As for any expli∣cit act or prohibition, forbidding children to come (into the christian church with their believing parents) neither Mr. <HI>B.</HI> nor any other, that I know of, plead such a bar.</Q> p. 36. And yet he had transcribed in the same page, part of my plea of such a bar, because God <HI>ex∣pressly</HI> says, the new covenant is <HI>not according</HI> to that which he made in <HI>the day</HI> wherein he first appointed such a practice. I am very sensible that children are freely called to come to Christ, and that 'tis a joyful thing to hear them cry, <HI>Hosanna</HI> to him, which implies <HI>faith</HI> in him as the <HI>Saviour;</HI> but I do plead an explicit prohibition against bringing them to baptism before they profess this faith. For the first administrator of baptism expressly required, <HI>fruits meet for repen∣tance,</HI> and said to the Jews, <HI>Think not to say we have Abraham to our father.</HI> Mat. 3.8, 9. I am sensible that many will here tell us, that this respects men's coming upon a <HI>personal</HI> right. True it does so; but then it is an explicit testa∣mony that baptism is not a token of the <HI>same</HI> co∣venant that circumcision was; for that covenant took in all the <HI>men</HI> of Abraham's house so strict∣ly, that if any one of them remained uncircum∣cised, <HI>that soul should be cut off from his people.</HI> Gen. 17.14. Thus the covenant that constitu∣ted that church, took in all the <HI>men</HI> of Abraham's
<PB N="11" REF="012655_0010_0F8BBEE718C68F50"/>house: and as the <HI>men</HI> of his house, were thus warned not to <HI>think</HI> of coming to baptism upon their <HI>father's</HI> right; and as the Hebrews were expressly told, that the new covenant is <HI>not ac∣cording</HI> to the covenant that was made in <HI>the day</HI> that first opened a door for <HI>strangers</HI> to bring, their <HI>housholds</HI> upon their faith; if all this does not lay an explicit bar against such a practice, I desire to know what can lay one?</P>
<P>I shall now endeavour to consider all the force of Mr. <HI>Fish's</HI> arguments against this point, as distinctly as my capacity will admit of.</P>
<P N="1">1. He endeavours to prove that this <HI>new</HI> co∣venant is set in opposition to the Sinai law, which neither took in nor cast out children, and not to Abraham's covenant, which he says, "was a pure covenant of grace." p. 29. And that infants, <Q>must certainly hold their place in the church, —unless by some special act of God, their pri∣vilege is taken away; which is not to be pro∣duced. Here then appears the <HI>fatal</HI> mistake of Mr. <HI>B. fatal</HI> to his cause.</Q> p. 32. Answer, if the taking away the name which the holy Ghost has given to that covenant, and adding that of <HI>pure grace</HI> to it; and applying Gal. 3.17. thereto, in which the apostle expressly refers to Abraham's justification by faith in Christ, <HI>before</HI> he took the <HI>bondwoman,</HI> by which he proves that the cove∣nant of circumcision is now to cease when the <HI>seed Christ</HI> is come. Gen. 12.3, and 15.6. Gal. 3.6, 8, 16, 17. and 4.31. If these things be duly examined, I believe the <HI>fatal</HI>-mistake will be found to belong to his cause, and not mine: for this new covenant is set in opposition to what was done, in the day they came out of Egypt,
<PB N="12" REF="012655_0011_0F8BBEE7C5139B38"/>more directly than to what was done at Sinai, months or years afterward.</P>
<P N="2">2. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> quotes a number of texts out of the old testament which speak the language of grace, and then says, <Q>I WILL and they SHALL, was ever the gracious word of God, or form of his covenant of grace; how then is this a <HI>bet∣ter covenant,</HI> established upon <HI>better promises?</HI> as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> argues.</Q> p. 34. Answer, I have already observed, that the covenant of grace was always the same, and the language, <HI>I will</HI> and <HI>they shall,</HI> in Abraham's covenant, insured the continuance of the church in the line of his pos∣terity, till THE SEED should come <HI>to whom the pro∣mise was made.</HI> Gal. 3.19. but then all that be∣lieved not in him, were <HI>broken off</HI> from the church of God.</P>
<P N="3">3. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> grants this, but still will have it that the christian dispensation preserves the <HI>same ma∣terials for kind,</HI> because the new covenant is made with <HI>Israel</HI> and <HI>Judah,</HI> p. 37. To which I reply, that I well know the gospel church was first con∣stituted of believing Jews; the second covenant was made with them, but then the covenant was <HI>new,</HI> and so different from the first, that Christ <HI>took the first out of the way, nailing it to his cross,</HI> that he might <HI>establish the second:</HI> and has charg∣ed us to <HI>beware</HI> lest any man, thro' <HI>philosophy and vain deceit,</HI> subject us to <HI>ordinances</HI> from those <HI>rudiments.</HI> Col. 2.8, 14, 20. Heb. 10.9.</P>
<P N="4">4. Our author would have it, that the cove∣nant is only circumstantially and not essentially new; to prove which he refers us to the law of <HI>love,</HI> which is essentially the same in all ages; yet our Lord calls it <HI>new.</HI> because he taught it more plainly, and pressed it by <HI>new motives,</HI> p. 35.
<PB N="13" REF="012655_0012_0F8BBEE894EEB420"/>I fully concur with his premises, but not with his consequence, for this new commandment is so far from being <HI>opposed</HI> to the old, that it is de∣clared to be <HI>the old commandment</HI> which we had <HI>from the beginning.</HI> John 13.34. 1 John 2.7, 8. Whereas this new covenant is <HI>not according</HI> to the old one; and the difference is so great that the first of Abraham's sons, and multitudes of those who came after, were in their <HI>sins,</HI> and did not <HI>know God,</HI> when they were taken into covenant, but the subjects of this new covenant <HI>all know him,</HI> and have their <HI>sins forgiven.</HI></P>
<P N="5">5. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> holds this difference to be only gra∣dual, and says, <Q>In gospel times the blessings of this new covenant were to issue forth <HI>more abundantly.</HI></Q> p. 35. But I answer, that the subject we are upon is, not the <HI>degree</HI> of things, but the <HI>nature</HI> of the church constitution; for he owns that <Q>'tis the <HI>covenant</HI> that makes the church <HI>what it is.</HI></Q> p. 39. I must therefore once more turn him to his own corrections, and observe, that THE form of the church which God has appointed says, <HI>They shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for</HI> ALL <HI>shall know me, from the</HI> LEAST <HI>to the greatest.</HI> Heb. 8.11. This is the covenant which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says, makes the church <HI>what it is.</HI> And who is there that does not know, that the <HI>oracles of God</HI> which were the <HI>chief</HI> pri∣vilege of the Jewish church, Rom. 3.2. were confined so much thereto, that before Christ had taken that covenant away, and nailed it to his cross, he expressly forbid his apostles to preach to any but those who were in it? yet after it was taken away he commanded them to <HI>teach all na∣tions,</HI>
<PB N="14" REF="012655_0013_0F8BBEE9457AA238"/>and to <HI>preach the gospel to every creature,</HI> in order to bring such as were <HI>taught</HI> and <HI>believed,</HI> to baptism and into the church. Mat. 10.5, 6, and 28.19. Mark 16.15, 16. So that the greatest difference between these two covenants appears to be, that men must have a standing in the first, in order to have the free use of the means which ordinarily <HI>teach them to know God;</HI> while these means in a clearer light, are now freely used with all nations, in order to bring them in∣to the second covenant; and that none come into the church aright but such as knew him before. And if any get in beside such as shall be <HI>saved,</HI> they do not come in by the <HI>door,</HI> but like <HI>thieves, climb up some other way,</HI> or <HI>creep in unawares:</HI> John 10.9. Gal. 2.4. Jude 4.</P>
<P>Here my opponant tries again to involve me in an absurdity, and says, <Q>Whether they got in by <HI>creeping,</HI> flyly or boldly; thro' the care∣lesness of the church, or with their <HI>consent</HI> and according to their judgment, it matters not in the present case; they are <HI>in the church:</HI> and so 'tis after all but a visible church, of the common stamp.</Q> p. 45. But where will tra∣dition carry men! who ever thought that if a thief has but once got <HI>into the house,</HI> that would make void the law that forbids his coming there and what school is it that will teach, that those who take God's <HI>covenant into their mouths,</HI> if they once <HI>see</HI> that a <HI>thief</HI> IS IN, it is "no matter" if they then CONSENT <HI>with him!</HI> Psalm 50.16, 18.</P>
<P>However I must not forget that our author says, I mistook his meaning. He tells us that his book treats of the church in a <HI>large</HI> sense, but that I take the word in the most <HI>limited</HI> sense.
<PB N="15" REF="012655_0014_0F8BBEEA60A39740"/>This he insists much upon. p. 10, 15, 16, 23, 51. To which I reply, that the title of his book is, <Q>The church of Christ a firm and durable house:</Q> and his first character of it is, <Q>That Jesus Christ has but ONE church in the world, and that is the <HI>sums</HI> which it always was.</Q> I observed that the <HI>invisible</HI> church is so, but en∣tered my exception against its being true of the <HI>visible</HI> church, which I took notice was what Mr. <HI>F.</HI> intended. Ex. p. 11. and whether the house be so large as he would make it or not, I thought was the main point of dispute between us; and to have first allowed it to be so large, and then to have tried to prove that it was not so, is a way that I never learned. Indeed he tells me, that my book "sufficiently proves" me not to be a <HI>learned</HI> man in their way. p. 126. and he also says, <Q>Needful accomplishments of <HI>learning,</HI> can be judged of by none but such as are <HI>them∣selves</HI> thus accomplished.</Q> p. 82. It seems then that I must refer it to the learned, whether the right way of disputing be for one to lay down a proposition, and for another to own it to be truth, and then try to prove that it is not so? and whether a <HI>master</HI> of <HI>arts</HI> would act in <HI>charac∣ter</HI> or not, if he declared that the other, "dis∣putes without an opponant, and talks entirly be∣side the purpose." p. 16, only because he did not first allow that what he disputes against is truth!</P>
<P>Might I be indulged with the common privi∣lege of English men, to be tried by my equals, I should not much fear the consequence; for as far as I am acquainted, people in towns endeavour to have their materials so <HI>framed,</HI> be∣fore
<PB N="16" REF="012655_0015_0F8BBEEF56BFE9E0"/>they are put into the <HI>house,</HI> that <HI>every joint</HI> may supply its place.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Eph. 2.21. and 4.16. Col. 2.19.</NOTE> And in new beginnings in the wilderness, where they build in the cours∣est manner, I think their materials are all <HI>cut off from their natural stock,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Rom. 11.24.</NOTE> before they are put into the house; and if a learned gentleman should tell those new beginners, that they ought to build their house so <HI>large,</HI> as to take in a good quantity of the <HI>young groth</HI> for future repairs; and one should attempt to convince him of his mistake, I hardly think the honest people would attribute their controversy to a mistake about the meaning of the word <HI>house.</HI></P>
<P>I was so far from mistaking his meaning, that I took particular notice, that Mr. <HI>F.</HI> holds those who own the covenant, according to the synod in 1662, and all baptized children, to be <HI>mem∣bers,</HI> so as to be under <Q>the faithful authoritative watch and discipline of the church,</Q> Tho' I observed, that the talk of disciplining such in our day, was but <HI>empty words.</HI> Ex. p. 104. <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">His notion of disciplining such, is to <HI>instruct</HI> and <HI>wait</HI> upon them "till their way is cleared" to come up to full communion. Ser. p. 90, 92, but what discipline is this, more than may be exercised toward those, who are not in the church? Any man in the Jewish church who <HI>forbore</HI> to keep the passover, unless necessarily hindered, was to be <HI>cut off from his people</HI> Num. 9.13. Hence Mr. <HI>F</HI>'s <HI>large</HI> notion of a church, has neither law nor gospel to support it.</NOTE> But he says of that part of my book, that he could not see as I had <HI>touched</HI> his arguments with anything <HI>to the purpose,</HI> and therefore passes it over. p. 118. So I shall leave these matters with the reader, and close this head with the following queries.</P>

<P N="2">II. Of the gospel <HI>manner of building</HI> churches.</P>
<P>I know Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says, <Q>I have really nothing to do with Mr. <HI>B.</HI> upon this head; 'tis out of the question, as a <HI>particular</HI> church is not <HI>the church,</HI> which my sermons treat of.</Q> p. 51. It may therefore be needful to enquire into the following things.</P>
<P N="1">1. Is any other visible church-state instituted in the gospel, but a particular one? <HI>The church</HI> spoken of by our Lord in Mat. 18.15,—18, is such an one as a brother can <HI>tell</HI> his grievance to; and whoever thought that could be to any other than a particular community? The seven churches of Asia are spoken to by their great Head, not as one national or provincial church, but as so many distinct churches, who are commended, or reproved by him, according as their <HI>works</HI> were, in each particular community. The church of
<PB N="18" REF="012655_0017_0F8BBEF2DDD29520"/>Corinth was reproved, for neglecting to <HI>judge</HI> such as were <HI>within,</HI> and not those <HI>without</HI> their particular society. 1 Cor. 5.12. And if Mr. <HI>F.</HI> was not treating of a particular church, what means his talk of the privilege of the baptized, as being under her authoritive watch and discipline? In truth our fathers were not a little puzzled with this question. One of them that concurred with another who had gone before him, in <HI>resolving</HI> to have an argument able to <HI>remove a mountain,</HI> before he would recede from infant baptism; and was <HI>peremptory</HI> for bringing persons to own the covenant, in order to bring their children to baptism, who did not see their way clear to come up to full communion; yet he confessed himself not to be so peremptory whether they were baptized as in a <HI>catholic,</HI> or in a <HI>particular</HI> church-state. But after much labour between him and others of great note upon it, they con∣cluded to rest the matter thus; <Q>That we are to distinguish between a particular church, as it is more <HI>strictly</HI> taken for a <HI>particular corpo∣ration</HI> of covenanting believers, entrusted by our Lord with the keys of the kingdom of heaven; and as it is more <HI>largely</HI> taken for that special part of our Lord's visible church, which doth <HI>subsist</HI> in this or that particular place.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Mitchel's life, p. 70, 78. and Dr. Increase Mather's, life. p. 54.</NOTE></Q> So that according to them, sub∣sisting in a particular <HI>place</HI> entitled such as would own the covenant to baptism and discipline, while the power to dispense them belonged to the church more strictly taken.
<PB N="19" REF="012655_0018_0F8BBEF309EA19E8"/>Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says, <Q>This is what our separate brethren <HI>improperly</HI> called a half-way cove∣nant.</Q> Ser. p. 92. If so his learned brethren have now got very openly into the same <HI>impro∣priety.</HI> Dr. <HI>Bellamy</HI> has writen a number of pie∣ces against it under that name; and a learned opponent of his says, <Q>As to the <HI>half-way</HI> practice; I am in it, but not for it. I have no disposition to oppose the Dr. in his endea∣vouring to break up that <HI>unscriptural practice;</HI> provided he will take the right course.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Moses Mather's second piece on the covenant; prin∣ted at New-Haven 1770, p. 78.</NOTE></Q> The course that he would have taken to break up that practice, is for ministers not to require per∣sons to profess a <HI>gracious state</HI> in order to come to the Lord's-supper; which brings us,</P>
<P N="2">2. To enquire whether persons ought to pro∣fess saving faith when they come into the church or not? Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> says, <Q>We desire no more to constitute <HI>church members,</HI> and we can desire no less than what in a judgment of charity may comply with the <HI>union</HI> that is between Christ the Head and the church, 1 Cor. 12.27. Eph. 2.22. 1 Cor. 3.16, 17. 2 Cor. 11.1. 18. 1 Thes. 1.1. &amp;c. that may in the same judgment answer the way of the beginning and increase of the church according to the will of God, who adds unto the church such as shall be <HI>saved.</HI> Acts 2.47. the rule of our receiving of them being <HI>because he hath receiv∣ed them,</HI> Rom. 14.1, 2. that may answer that profession of faith which was the <HI>foundation</HI> of the church, which was not what <HI>flesh and blood,</HI>
<PB N="20" REF="012655_0019_0F8BBEF3CCF2D990"/>but what <HI>God himself revealed,</HI> Mat. 16.16. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">His nature of a gospel church, p. 14. The same author elsewhere largely proves, that no other church-state was instituted by Christ, but a <HI>particular</HI> one. See his original of evangelical churches. p. 61, 67, 186.</NOTE></Q> The last of these scriptures is connected with Mr. <HI>Fish's</HI> text. To which I shall only add, that, tho' some in our day would have it, that believ∣ing with <HI>all the heart,</HI> which was required of the Eunuch in order for baptism, meant something short of saving faith; yet Paul says, If thou shalt confess with thy <HI>mouth</HI> the Lord Jesus, and shalt <HI>believe in thine heart,</HI> that God raised him from the dead, thou <HI>shalt be saved.</HI> Rom. 10.9. Note, he that believes <HI>in his heart, shall be saved;</HI> how daring then is it for any to argue that, a believ∣ing with <HI>all the heart,</HI> can mean any lower kind of faith!</P>
<P N="3">3. How is this faith to be confessed? The foregoing scriptures and many more shew, that it was with the <HI>mouth</HI> or verbally; tho' many would have it to be general and not particular: to prove which the Eunuch's declaration is some∣times produced. Not observing, that Philip had immediate teaching from heaven to go to him, and got well acquainted with his soul-exercises before this confession; nor the vast difference there is between saying, <HI>I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God,</HI> now when a man would expose himself in the world to say the contrary; to what it was then, when that truth was so much denied. Saints are often called God's witnesses; and who does not know, that the general tes∣timony from such is not ordinarily enough, but men want to hear in particular, how
<PB N="21" REF="012655_0020_0F8BBEF48FF95B00"/>they came to the knowledge of what they testify? Hence, tho' Peter had immediate direction from above to go to Cornelius, yet when he came he would have from <HI>his mouth</HI> an account how he came to send for him. And when the church at Jerusalem wanted satisfaction of Peter about that matter, he did not turn them off with a general declarati∣on, that the holy Ghost sent him, and owned him; tho' he had a much better claim to be credited by that church, than common persons now have to be credited by a church they would join with: but instead of turning them off with generals, Peter <HI>rehearsed the matter from the be∣ginning, and expounded it by order unto them.</HI> Acts: 11.4. And as our Lord has commanded his disciples, not to give <HI>holy things</HI> to unholy crea∣tures, and to <HI>beware</HI> of false prophets, saying, <HI>ye shall know them by their fruits.</HI> Mat. 7.6, 15, 16. so he has explained those fruits to be, what is <HI>brought forth</HI> out of the <HI>heart</HI> by <HI>speaking.</HI> Luk. 6.45. and John says, <HI>That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us.</HI> And do not these things sufficiently prove that the gospel method of pro∣fessing our faith, is by a particular declaring of it with our mouths?</P>
<P N="4">4. To whom is the declaration to be made? Mr. <HI>F.</HI> refers us to a clause in Cambridge pla∣form where they say, in case of <Q>excessive fear,— 'tis sufficient that the <HI>elders,</HI> having received <HI>private</HI> satisfaction, make relation thereof in public before the church.</Q> p. 51. But as he had spent the four preceding pages, in trying to prove that one of our fathers "worst mistaker."
<PB N="22" REF="012655_0021_0F8BBEF550875E78"/>was their allowing the brotherhood too much pow∣er; I believe I ought to be allowed a little room there to prove, that in this case they did not allow them enough. For there is no point more expressly forbidden by our Lord, than for ministers to as∣sume a power <HI>like civil rulers.</HI> Mat. 20.25—27. Mark 10.42—44. Luke 22.25—27. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>All the pleas of the Romanists are utterly insufficient to secure their papal dominion from this sword of the mouth of the Lord Jesus; for, whereas their utmost pretence and defence consists in this, That it is not dominion and pow∣er <HI>absolutely</HI> that is forbidden, but the <HI>unlawful, tyranni∣cal, oppressive</HI> exercise of power;—never was there any dominion in the world, more cruel,—than that of the Popes hath been. But it is evident, that our Lord doth not in the least reflect on the rule or government of the Kings aud Princes of the gentiles—He speaks of <HI>them</HI> in an especial manner, whom their subjects, for their moderate and equal rule, called <HI>benefactors.</HI> And such a power or preheminence it was,—that the two disciples desired in <HI>his kingdom,</HI> which gave occasion to this declaration.—He will have,—no <HI>courts,</HI> no <HI>coercive jurisdiction;</HI>—for by these means do the Princes of the gentiles, those that are the <HI>benefactors</HI> of their countries, rule among them. And this is most evident from what in opposition hereunto he prescribes unto his own dis∣ciples, the greatest, and best in office, grace and gifts; namely a <HI>ministry</HI> only, to be discharged in the way of <HI>service.</HI> How well this great command and direction of our Lord Jesus hath been and is complied withal, by those who have taken on them to be rulers in the church, is sufficiently known.</Q>
<P>Dr. Owen's nature of a gospel church. p. 79, 30.</P></NOTE>
Yet where are the civil judges that are allowed the power to examine witnesses in <HI>private,</HI> and then to read or relate their restimony in public, with∣out giving full liberty to all who are concerned, to hear and examine the witnesses themselves! Will "excessive fear" excuse witnesses in earthly
<PB N="23" REF="012655_0022_0F8BBEF610EE55D8"/>courts? if not, what a shame is it to pretend that any are fit to be received as God's witnesses, who can't tell before their brethren something of what they know concerning the truth and love! As to a relation of experiences, before all the con∣gregation, which was our fathers common prac∣tice, and is often of great benefit; yet I insist not on that for every one; but before the church I think none ought to be received without it. In the epistle to <HI>all the saints</HI> at Rome, members as well as officers, they were required to <HI>receive</HI> him that was <HI>in the faith</HI> tho' <HI>weak;</HI> and to <HI>re∣ceive one another</HI> as Christ received them. Rom. 1.7. and 14.1. and 15.7. And how can that be done without hearing of them? yet don't mis∣take me; what I plead for a relation of (as pre∣sident <HI>Edwards</HI> said) are the great things wherein godliness consists, and not the persons opinion of his own good estate.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Should any here object, that Mr. <HI>Edwards</HI> was against the custom I plead for; I reply, that I know he seems to say much against it, particularly in his discourse on the <HI>affecti∣ons;</HI> tho' I think he does not pretend to bring any scripture against it; but only that he did not see full proof for it; therefore if I have brought proof for it, he has nothing against that. What he chiefly appeared against, was the tying persons up to one particular order of experience; and also a being taken with some striking words in their declara∣tion, without due regard to the whole nature of it, and likewise to their life and conversation. And herein I am full in his sentiments; and would intreat all, not to be taken with, or to judge according to <HI>appearance,</HI> but to judge <HI>righteous judgment.</HI> Yet after all Mr. <HI>Edward,</HI> was so far from excluding the telling of experience, that he expressly requires it, in candidates for the ministry.

We come,</P>
<P N="3">III. To consider of the gospel method of <HI>or∣ganizing</HI> churches.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="012655_0023_0F8BBEF6C4168240"/>
Our author in his sermons tells us, that Christ did not go to colleges or schools of learning for his first ministers, but that they whom he took into his school, were chiefly <HI>unlearned</HI> and <HI>ignorant</HI> men; to whom in a little time, he gave such a measure of knowledge, learning, and grace, as abundantly qualified them for the great work, whereto he appointed them. Yet now since the canon of scripture is compleated, he says, <Q>It must be but a fond conceit, a remark without reason, judgment or truth—to say, The Lord is now raising up and sending forth,—unlearn∣ed and ignorant men.</Q> And he represents all such as going <Q>without any warrant or call from the King of Zion,</Q> and compares them to <HI>Sceva</HI>'s sons. Acts 19.15, 16.</P>
<P>But of them that are furnished with <HI>knowledge</HI> and <HI>understanding,</HI> he says, <Q>Such men being found, and presenting <HI>themselves,</HI> with a hum∣ble and serious <HI>desire</HI> to engage in the work (1 Tim. 3.1.) the apostle farther directs and charges, that they shall have the work of the <HI>ministry committed</HI> to them by authorized hands, even by <HI>officers</HI> already in the church.</Q> &amp;c. In reference to which, as I came across his use of the word extraordinary in another case, I inserted a note upon the great things that were done by that word, and said, <Q>The power of Christ in <HI>qualifying</HI> men for ministry, without going to colleges for them, is hereby limitted to the apostles days; and all are rejected with con∣tempt by Mr. <HI>F.</HI> who do not receive their <HI>gifts</HI> at <HI>college,</HI> and their <HI>authority</HI> from <HI>authorized</HI> hands, p. 15—17, and these authorized hands, by the help of this word have got such an
<PB N="25" REF="012655_0024_0F8BBEF7D7E81A18"/><HI>extraordinary</HI> power as the apostles never had. For the apostles were only <HI>witnesses</HI> for Christ, and as such pointed out to the church, what qualifications officers should have, and said, <HI>Brethren look ye out among you</HI> such men. Acts 1.8. and 6.3. But these pretended suc∣cessors of the apostles, assume a power to limit the church, in her choice to such as they have <HI>approbated;</HI> which I trust will be made evident to be a power which the apostles never had.</Q> Ex. p. 24, 25.</P>
<P>The reader may note, that here I spake of the qualifying, approbating, and choice of officers; but Mr. <HI>F.</HI> passes over what I <HI>said,</HI> and pre∣sumes to tell what I <HI>meant:</HI> for he says, <Q>'tis evident Mr. <HI>B.</HI> there means a power of or∣daining officers in the church.</Q> And so fix∣ing upon what I neither said nor meant in that place, he accuses me with <Q>keeping back the principal words in the text, as it relates to the present question:</Q> and with affirming that the apostles, "never had <HI>power</HI> to ordain;"—with a <Q>presumptuous handling of the holy scriptures, and a daring corrupting of the sense of them,</Q> &amp;c. p. 65, 66. The way he takes to try to prove that I meant what I did not express, is to tell the reader that I refer to a page in his book that treats of ordination; as if I had referred to but one page; whereas my re∣ference was exactly as I have now laid it before the reader, who will judge whether I have injured the truth or not, since the apostles only describ∣ed what those officers qualifications and work should be, and then called the church to <HI>look them out;</HI> and the church did so, and <HI>they</HI> set
<PB N="26" REF="012655_0025_0F8BBEFC32CFEB58"/>those whom they had looked out, <HI>before</HI> the a∣postles. But the modern method is, for such as <HI>desire</HI> to be ministers, <HI>humbly</HI> to <HI>present themselves</HI> before officers to be approbated; and the church is limited, in her choice of ministers, to such candidates.</P>
<P>This Mr. <HI>F.</HI> cannot deny, but after saying much upon it, he comes to these words; <Q>Al∣though we think the affair of examination and judging of the qualifications of candidates for the ministry, is committed to the <HI>ministers,</HI> by the Head of the churches, yet we neither arrogate it <HI>wholly</HI> to ourselves, as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> char∣ges, i. e. so as to exclude the people from try∣ing and judging and choosing for themselves; nor do we ever pretend to <HI>impose</HI> upon <HI>them,</HI> those whom we examine and approbate.</Q> p. 82. Reply: What I charged them with, he is here forced to own; and though his mind was so intent upon ministerial power, as not to men∣tion the churches choice, in the page which he says treats of ordination, yet I did not suppose that he excluded the people from a choice a∣mong their candidates; and to say I charge them therewith, is what I deny, and let him prove it if he can. This art of slipping in something which does not belong to the case in hand, to prevent its appearing in its true light, is a dreadful part of the <HI>learning</HI> of our world. Not only so, but he has also proved himself <HI>in∣excusably</HI> guilty of the <HI>same thing</HI> that he unjust∣ly charged upon me; namely, of keeping back principal words of scripture, on which the present question depended. For when I produced our Lord's commendation of the church of Ephe∣sus,
<PB N="27" REF="012655_0026_0F8BBEFEB88E0318"/>Rev. 2. to prove that it is the churches work to <HI>try ministers,</HI> Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says, <Q>These words were spoken <HI>to</HI> and <HI>of</HI> the <HI>angel</HI> or <HI>minister</HI> of the church.</Q> p. 81. And keeps back those important words, that the epistle is, <HI>What the</HI> SPIRIT <HI>saith</HI> UNTO THE CHURCHES. What a <Q>daring and manifest corrupting of the holy scripture is here!</Q></P>
<P>So when I observed that in Paul's day, letters of commendation were <HI>to</HI> and <HI>from the church;</HI> but proved that some ministers in our land claim a power like civil rulers, contrary to the express command of Christ, and then said, If ministers would leave their <HI>worldly</HI> comparisons, and attend wholly to divine rule, I believe they would find that it belongs to the church <HI>with</HI> them to try ministers. Ex. p. 40, 41. Yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> takes much pains to make the reader believe that I don't hold so, and at last says of the Corinthian church, <Q>If letters of commendation went <HI>from</HI> them or came <HI>to</HI> them, 'twill be hard for Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to prove that the <HI>brotherhood</HI> and <HI>not</HI> the <HI>ministers,</HI> gave and received them</Q> p. 83. I was so far from saying <HI>Not</HI> the ministers, that I said The church <HI>with</HI> them; and if men under a pretence of learning may thus change our words from <HI>with</HI> to <HI>not,</HI> what will they not do to serve their own turn!</P>
<P>From approbation we now come to ordination; and I observe that the grand point wherein he accuses me with perverting scripture is my saying the apostles were only <HI>witnesses;</HI> <Q>which (says he) every one knows are persons that act in a very different character from those who <HI>appoint, set</HI>
<PB N="28" REF="012655_0027_0F8BBEFF9ECBFCC8"/>and <HI>six</HI> in a station or office.</Q> p. 66. Answer 1. It is so in earthly states; tho' by the way, 'tis as well known, that in such states all office-power is originally derived from the people; and in the Massachusetts, if not in other provinces, com∣mon towns have power, when they have elected their officers, to invest them therewith, by their moderators giving them their oaths, before the meeting is dissolved; and would he place the church of Christ beneath our common towns?</P>
<P>Answer 2. Our Lord himself told his apostles, that they should receive <HI>power,</HI> after the holy Ghost came upon them; and that they should be <HI>witnesses</HI> unto him, both in Jerusalem, and unto the uttermost part of the earth. Acts 1.8. And in after times he speaks of giving <HI>power</HI> unto his <HI>witnesses,</HI> and they shall prophesy. Rev. 11.3, 6. Therefore let our author and others consider well, where men have got to, who plead for <HI>power</HI> to "act-in a <HI>character</HI> very different from" that which the Son of God gave to his apostles, and to later ministers. The gift of God which Timo∣thy received by the putting on of Paul's hands, and which he was called to <HI>stir up,</HI> was <HI>not the spirit of fear, but of</HI> POWER, <HI>and of</HI> LOVE, <HI>and of a</HI> SOUND MIND. A <HI>power</HI> to keep him from being <HI>ashamed of the</HI> TESTIMONY <HI>of our Lord,</HI> or of his suffering servants. A power to <HI>hold fast the form of sound words in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus,</HI> at a time when many <HI>turned away</HI> from that cause. 2 Tim. 1.6—8, 13—15. This pow∣er keeps Christ's ministers from <HI>fainting,</HI> and enables them to <HI>renounce the hidden things of dis∣honesty, not walking in</HI> CRAFTINESS, <HI>nor handling the word of God</HI> DECEITFULLY, <HI>but by manifesta∣tion
<PB N="29" REF="012655_0028_0F8BBEFFC8C1F950"/>of the</HI> TRUTH, <HI>commending themselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</HI> And any minister who has not a measure of this <HI>power,</HI> if he could have as many bishops or presbyters, to lay their hands upon him, as could stand betwixt here and Jerusalem, they could not make it the duty of any soul to obey him as a minister of Christ. What we are called to is to <HI>obey the truth;</HI> and so far as ministers hold forth the truth by word and example, it is an important duty to obey and follow them; yea to esteem them highly in love for their <HI>works sake.</HI> Gal. 3. 1. Phil. 3.17.1 Thes. 5.12, 13. Heb. 13.7, 17. And those who <HI>despise</HI> such, despise him that sent them. Luke 10.16.</P>
<P>But to have men's <HI>persons in admiration because of advantage</HI> is an evil way; even tho' it were the person of an <HI>apostle</HI> or an <HI>angel from heaven.</HI> Gal. 1.9. Jude 16. And as all true religion has its seat in the hearts and consciences of men, from whence it flows out into their lives and conduct; so Joshua when he had laid open the truth to Israel, said, if it seems evil <HI>unto you</HI> to serve the Lord, <HI>choose you this day whom you will serve.</HI> And Jesus Christ said to the Jews, <HI>Why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right.</HI> And Paul said to the Christians, <HI>I speak as to wise men, judge ye what I say.</HI> Hence it is referred to every conscience, whether we can justly view the apos∣tles in any other light, than as being Christ's <HI>witnesses</HI> and the <HI>churches servants.</HI> 2 Cor. 4.5. pointing out to the church what was to be done; who having chosen their officers, and set them before them, that the apostles in consequence of the churches act, laid hands on them, and were
<PB N="30" REF="012655_0029_0F8BBF009E52DCF8"/>the churches mouth to heaven for a blessing on said officers. I think this idea is confirmed by what Peter says of himself; for when writing to elders, he stiles himself also an <HI>elder,</HI> and a <HI>wit∣ness</HI> of the sufferings of Christ, and a <HI>partaker</HI> of the glory that shall be revealed. From whence he exhorts the elders of churches, to feed the flock of God, taking the oversight thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind; neither <HI>as being lords</HI> over God's heritage, but being <HI>ensamples</HI> of the flock.</P>
<P>Now you may remember that Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> (as quoted a little back) tells us, that the utmost pretence and defence of the Romanists, to secure their dominion is, That it is not dominion ab∣solutely that is forbidden, but the <HI>unlawful ty∣ranical</HI> exercise of power. And I before refer∣red Mr. <HI>F.</HI> to one of his brethren in the same county with him, and a trustee of one of the col∣leges, that he would limit Christ's church to for ministers, who asserts, that the rights conveyed by the keys, and belonging to the <HI>eldership only,</HI> are <Q>As distinct as the rights of a magistrate are from those of a private freeman, in a civil community. These rights are connected <HI>with,</HI> and inherent <HI>in</HI> the <HI>office</HI> of the elder∣ship. —The express charge given them, not to <HI>lord</HI> it over God's heritage, supposeth them to have such rights and powers <HI>above, over,</HI> and distinct <HI>from,</HI> and independent <HI>of</HI> the church.—For—'tis not possible they should be in danger of <HI>abusing</HI> a power they never had.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">A second letter upon lay-ordination, by Mr. George Beck-with of Lyme.

<PB N="31" REF="012655_0030_0F8BBF015BAB05E8"/>between Roman catholics, and some New-England presbyterians', as to their pleas for pow∣er is, The catholic pleads that the scripture for∣bids, only their <HI>tyranical use</HI> of lordly power; and the presbyterian pleads that what is forbidden is the <HI>abuse</HI> of it. And according to both, Peter mistook the case when he said, Not <HI>as lords;</HI> for he ought to have said, Not <HI>as tyrants!</HI> and so they are the reverse of the apostles, who spake not in the <HI>words</HI> which <HI>man's wisdom teacheth, but which the holy Ghost teacheth;</HI> comparing <HI>spiritual with spiritual.</HI> 1 Cor. 2.13. For these late plea∣ders for power, speak not in the <HI>words</HI> which the <HI>holy Ghost</HI> teacheth, but in those which man's wis∣dom teacheth; comparing Christ's <HI>heavenly</HI> king∣dom to <HI>earthly</HI> states, directly in the face of his word.</P>
<P>Our author imagines that as our excellent fa∣thers, <Q>had indeed felt the severities of a usurp∣ed power at home, the power of the clergy, it endangered the other extreme.—Here they abate to themselves the <HI>power</HI> which Christ their Lord had given them, in the point of ordination.</Q> p. 46. But when all is said and done, can it be more certain that three and two make five, than it is, that if the power of ordina∣tion is only in officers, then he must have an un∣interrupted succession of such ordinations, down from the apostles, or else he has not a right ordi∣nation himself? To try to cover the matter with <HI>don't knows</HI> is to go back into the church which holds <HI>ignorance</HI> as the mother of devotion. As in the jewish church the priesthood was limited to one line, so I produced an instance, of such as the sacred historian allows to be children of the
<PB N="32" REF="012655_0031_0F8BBF0211311B98"/><HI>priests;</HI> yet because they could not <HI>find</HI> the <HI>regis∣ter</HI> of their <HI>genealogy,</HI> they were <HI>as polluted, put from the priesthood.</HI> Ezra 2.62. which I thought was to the point in hand; but Mr. <HI>F.</HI> starts off, and will not own that he held forth an uninterrup∣ted line; only that Christ has always supplied his church with able ministers according to his promise (and who denied that?) Then from an old book he mentions the names of some in each century; and I observe that <HI>baptists</HI> ministers will do as wellas any, if people do not know them to be such. For in the 12th century, beside others he says, <Q>Were <HI>Peter Bruis</HI> and his scho∣lar <HI>Henry</HI> of Tholouse, two famous preachers against popish errors.</Q> p. 25. So it seems, and one of those popish errors was infant baptism; for Dr. <HI>Wall,</HI> one of their greatest writers for that practice, say of these two men, that they were, <Q>The first <HI>antipedobaptists</HI> preachers, that ever set up a church, or society of men, holding that opinion against infant baptism, and <HI>re∣baptized</HI> such as had been baptized in infan∣cy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Wall's history of infant baptifm, part II. p. 184. Vide Gill's answer to Dickinson, p. 32. By the same authority we find, that <HI>Gerhardus</HI> and <HI>Dulcinus,</HI> whom Mr. <HI>F.</HI> calls, Two famous preachers in the 13th centu∣ry, were likewise baptists.</NOTE></Q> Yet many of our ministers even to this day, will dare to tell their people, That the first baptists in the world, were those of Mun∣ster, four hundred years afterward!</P>
<P>To sum up this matter; if Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has not a <HI>register</HI> to shew, of an uninterrupted succession of ministerial ordinations clear from the apostles, I leave him and all to consider, whether, accord∣ing
<PB N="33" REF="012655_0032_0F8BBF02E0E445D8"/>to the plain scripture example which ash been produced, he ought not, either as <HI>polluted</HI> to be put from the ministry, or else own him∣self to have been unjust in blaming, both our fathers and us, for holding the power of ordina∣tion to be in the church? I proceed to consider</P>
<P N="4">IV. Of the difference between civil and eccle∣siastical government.</P>
<P>In opening the constitution of those which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> calls standing churches, I produced ma∣ny facts, to shew how civil and ecclesiastical af∣fairs have been confounded together in our coun∣try; which has done amazing mischief, and was the worst mistake that our fathers brought to this land. I fully declared <HI>for a harmony</HI> between the church and state, but <HI>against such a union</HI> be∣tween them, as has been practised among us. Ex. p. 23.</P>
<P>In reply Mr. <HI>F.</HI> blames me much for not let∣ting these matters rest as our fathers had left them, while yet he has not the courage to justify all their conduct, nor to run the line, or fix the bound between the two powers, better than they did; and says, "This is too delicate an affair "for me to attempt." p. 56. Then he goes on to prove, what I never in the least denied, that the Jewish church and state were united, while yet their acts as to civil polity, and religi∣ous worship, were kept distinct. p. 56.57. Yet from this and some other things he tries to con∣fute, or else to confound me.</P>
<P>Two things therefore appear necessary here to be considered; which are, how the civil rulers in Israel did behave toward the church, and what the difference is betwixt us and them.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="012655_0033_0F8BBF03A06EE6F8"/>
First, how did Israel's civil rulers behave to∣ward the church? This may be answered in two branches.</P>
<P N="1">1. As to a place and furniture for worship. Tho' their great Lawgiver could, had he seen fit, as exactly have proportioned each man's part of the expence, as to have given the <HI>pattern</HI> of what was to be made; yet instead of that, after giving notice of what was wanted, he said, Who∣soever is of a <HI>willing</HI> heart, let <HI>him bring an Off∣ring unto the Lord,</HI> gold, silver, &amp;c. Exod. 35.5. And when their costly temple was to be built. David like a <HI>nursing father,</HI> led the way, and of his <HI>own proper goods,</HI> offered very largely; and then exhorted his people to do the like; which had such effect, as caused him with grateful won∣der to say. <Q>As for me in the uprightness of my heart I have <HI>willingly</HI> offered all these things; and now have I seen with joy, thy people which are present here, to offer <HI>willingly unto thee.</HI></Q> 1 Chron. 29.3, 17.</P>
<P>Who can fail to observe, that here it appears, both in the provision that was made for the ta∣bernacle, and for the temple, that what was done was <HI>offered to the Lord,</HI> and that, as each one found a <HI>willing heart,</HI> without any prescribing or compelling in either case? Indeed half a shekel was prescribed for each man to offer, to make attonement for his soul, in which the rich should not give more, nor the poor less. Exod. 30.15. Importing that all souls are of equal value; which money was for the service of the tabernacle. And when the temple needed repair∣ing in after times, the king said to the priests, all this money, and all the money that <HI>cometh into
<PB N="35" REF="012655_0034_0F8BBF04470FE450"/>any mans heart to bring into the house of the Lord,</HI> let the priests take it, every man of his acquain∣tance, and let them repair the breaches of the house. 2 Kings, 12.4, 5. But they being ne∣gligent of their duty, the king reproved them for it; and at his commandment they prepared a chest, and sat it in the gate of the house, and made a <HI>proclamation</HI> through Judah and Jerusa∣lem, to <HI>bring in to the Lord</HI> the collection that Moses commanded. And <HI>all the princes,</HI> and <HI>all the people rejoiced,</HI> and <HI>brought in</HI> and <HI>cast into the chest in abundance.</HI> 2 Chron. 24.6, 8—11. This was their method, as to the place of worship, and</P>
<P N="2">2. Concerning the support of those who mi∣nistred in it; we find that the great land-lord and proprietor of all things, enjoined it upon Is∣rael, to offer him the first fruits, and also the tenth of all their increase, to be a provision for his ministers, for the stranger, fatherless and widow; which they were to offer as they would expect a continuance, and a <HI>blessing</HI> on his land. Levit. 18.9—13. Deut. 26.1—15. Those also who ministred at the altar, were to partake with it. Levit. 6.16—26.1 Cor. 9.13.</P>
<P>And we find in the reformation in Hezekiah's time, that he first stired up those ministers to their duty, and then the people to give them their <HI>portion,</HI> that they might be <HI>encouraged</HI> in their work; and as soon as his commandment came abroad, the children of Isarel <HI>brought in abundance.</HI> 2 Chron. 31.2—5. And after the Jews return from captivity, they were very parti∣cular in their covenant concerning these matters; and, when they neglected to act accordingly, Nehemiah contended with them, and stirred them
<PB N="36" REF="012655_0035_0F8BBF055655C218"/>up to their duty. Neh. 10.32—39. and 13.10—12. Afterwards the Lord by his prophet, charged them with <HI>robbing</HI> him in these things, and declares that he had <HI>cursed</HI> the whole nation therefor: but calls them to <HI>return</HI> unto him, and <HI>bring in</HI> the <HI>stores</HI> so that their might be <HI>meat</HI> in his house, and to prove him therewith, if he would not pour them out such a <HI>blessing,</HI> that they should not have room enough to receive it. Mal. 3.7—10. All which very clearly shew, that both rulers and prophets, endeavoured each in their place, to stir up the priests and Levites to do their duty in the house of God, and to stir up the people to do their part, both toward his house, and towards those who ministred therein; but I cannot find that rulers were ever allowed, much less required, to use any <HI>force</HI> to bring any to it. We have many accounts of their inflict∣ing corporal punishments in other affairs, but not in this.</P>
<P>Secondly, What is the difference between the Jewish state and ours? I answer</P>
<P N="1">1. The laws of their state, were made by infallible authority; ours are but the <HI>ordinances</HI> of fallible <HI>men.</HI> 1 Pet. 2.13.</P>
<P N="2">2. As God was the King of that state, idolatry was treason against him as such; hence his laws were most strict, that if a brother, the wife of their bosom, or a friend that was as their <HI>own soul,</HI> should secretly entice them to serve <HI>other gods,</HI> they should not only refuse to consent; but says God, <HI>Thou shalt surely kill him.</HI> And if they found that one of their cities had thus turned away. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>bitants of that city with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="37" REF="012655_0036_0F8BBF05E9A04FA0"/>Deut. 13.6, 9—15. But the King of Zion says, <HI>My Kingdom is not of this world;</HI> which he gave as the reason why his servants should not <HI>fight,</HI> to prevent his being delivered into the hands of his enemies. John 18.36. And his laws allow of some sort of <HI>company</HI> with <HI>idolaters</HI> of this <HI>world;</HI> and if a <HI>brother</HI> in the <HI>church</HI> be found guilty of this crime, christians are only required to come out and be <HI>separate from such company.</HI> 1 Cor. 5.10, 11.2 Cor. 6.17.</P>
<P N="3">3. If Israel would set up a king over them, it must be from <HI>among their brethren,</HI> and says God, Thou mayest not set a <HI>stranger</HI> over thee, which is <HI>not thy brother.</HI> Deut. 17.15. But it was in obedience to a decree from Caesar, (a <HI>stranger</HI> and an <HI>idolater</HI>) that Joseph with Mary came to Bethlehem, when Jesus was born, Luke 2.1, 7. And when the Jews asked Jesus, if it was <HI>lawful</HI> to give <HI>tribute</HI> to such a ruler? his answer was, Render unto Caesar, the things which are Caesars; and unto God, the things that are Gods. Mat. 22.21. And his gospel expressly allows, the <HI>sword to execute wrath</HI> upon evil do∣ers, in civil states. Rom. 13.4. Whereas the foundation and support of Christ's Kingdom is TRUTH. John 18.36, 37. And tho' his servants walk <HI>in the flesh,</HI> yet they are <HI>not to war after the flesh;</HI> for their <HI>weapons are not carnal.</HI> 2 Cor. 10.3, 4. Were this difference between church and state justly viewed, it would obviate the objecti∣on that some make, against any use of the carnal weapon at all, as well as prevent others abusing of it about religion as many do: For,</P>
<P N="4">4. In the Jewish state the <HI>priests</HI> sentence had
<PB N="38" REF="012655_0037_0F8BBF0A85433E88"/><HI>liberty;</HI> and such as he pronounced <HI>utterly un∣clean,</HI> must be had away <HI>without the camp.</HI> Levit. 13.1—46. And by his sentence a man might dwell in his own house or not; yea by it, a house must be <HI>broken down,</HI> and its materials carried <HI>without the city.</HI> Levit. 14.44, 45. And their power went so far as to <HI>thrust a king</HI> out of the temple when he appeared to be <HI>unclean.</HI> 2 Chron. 26.20. But what awful tyranny, yea hellish cruelty, has been practised under the christian name, by the <HI>priestcraft</HI> of those who have <HI>confounded</HI> the Jewish and christian consti∣tutions together! Tho' if we view them in their distinct light; the high priest was an evident type of Him who has the <HI>key</HI> of David, that openeth, and no man shutteth, and shutteth, and no man openeth. Rev. 3.7. And the other priests were types of the <HI>lively</HI> materials of which his <HI>house is built.</HI> 1 Pet. 2.5. And by the sentence of our great high priest, a <HI>house</HI> or church, which will not be <HI>cleansed</HI> or reformed, is taken down or <HI>remov∣ed out of its place.</HI> Rev. 2.5. And by the same power will our earthly <HI>tabernacle</HI> be <HI>dissolved.</HI> 2 Cor. 5.1—4.</P>
<P>And as the apostles were inspired to publish his gospel, they restored to <HI>men</HI> the <HI>key of know∣ledge</HI> which blind guides had <HI>taken away.</HI> Mat. 23.13. Luke. 11.52. And were instruments of opening a <HI>door of faith</HI> unto the gentiles. Acts 14.27. And by the same authority they gave rules for receiving members into Christ's church; and by his <HI>power</HI> the <HI>church</HI> of God at Corinth, <HI>called to be saints,</HI> were required, when they were <HI>gathered together,</HI> to <HI>put away from among them∣selves</HI> a wicked person. 1 Cor. 1.2. and 5.4, 13.
<PB N="39" REF="012655_0038_0F8BBF0CDA23E118"/>and their obedience thereto was a punishment <HI>in∣flicted of many.</HI> 2 Cor. 2.6. And not a word of its being a work done only by officers. <HI>Diotrephes</HI> who assumed such a power to himself, when an apostle wrote <HI>unto the church;</HI> his <HI>prating</HI> and <HI>malice</HI> therein is exposed, for a warning to all after ages. 3 John 9.10.</P>
<P>Ministers, as distinct from other saints, are never called priests in the new-testament; there∣fore the power of the ancient priests to govern in the house of God, is an argument for, and not against the government of Christ's house, being in the church as a body. In all civil govern∣ments, from the greatest empires to our common families, some have power to <HI>judge for others,</HI> which power others ought to <HI>submit to;</HI> but our Lord has most plainly forbidden, either the assu∣ming or submitting to any such thing in religion. Luke 22.25—27. Truth is ever to be submit∣ted to, tho' bad men deliver it; but we are for∣bidden to call any man on earth <HI>master</HI> or <HI>father.</HI> Mat. 23.1—9. Ministers should be <HI>burning and shining lights,</HI> and rule the church as the sun <HI>rules the day,</HI> by holding forth <HI>light</HI> and <HI>heat,</HI> to direct and quicken men in their walk and work. This is to be done by word and and example. Mat. 5.14—16. Heb. 13.7, 8, 17. And dreadful will be the case of all souls who disobey such rule and influence; but even women are called to <HI>look to it,</HI> that they <HI>receive not</HI> ANY teacher of a contrary character, as they would escape a <HI>partaking of his evil deeds.</HI> 2 John 8.11.</P>
<P>Once more,</P>
<P N="5">5. The same birth that brought a Jew into the <HI>world,</HI> brought him also into the <HI>church,</HI> even
<PB N="40" REF="012655_0039_0F8BBF0EDC30A108"/>so that if a conformity to its ordinances was <HI>ne∣glected,</HI> he must be <HI>cut off from his people.</HI> Gen. 17.14. Num. 9.13. And if he or a stranger blasphemed God's name or committed adultry, they must <HI>surely be put to death.</HI> Levit. 20.10, 11. and 24.16. But the gospel only requires. excommunication for such crimes, if impenitent, and forgives and receives such persons, when penitent. Mat. 12.31. John 8.11.1 Cor. 5.1. 2 Cor. 2.7.1 Tim. 1.13, 20. And though Christ sows nothing but good seed where ever his gospel comes, yet he knew how the devil would do the contrary; and also how his own servants would be in danger of acting toward the <HI>tares,</HI> the children of the <HI>wicked one,</HI> when they <HI>appear∣ed</HI> among <HI>his children;</HI> therefore he stated this case in a parable, and then explained it to his disciples, to let them know, that the order of the <HI>kingdom of heaven</HI> is, to let <HI>both grow together</HI> in the <HI>world</HI> till the end of it. Mat. 13.24—30, 37—39. Yet how dreadfully have these orders been violated in our land!</P>
<P>I produced many instances of violent methods that were taken, with such as would not conform to, nor support the <HI>parish ministers.</HI> Mr. <HI>F.</HI> now says, It is quite injurious for me to charge these things upon <HI>ministers</HI> or <HI>churches;</HI> and says, <Q>Whether those prosecutions he speaks of, were <HI>fact,</HI> or if <HI>fact,</HI> whether <HI>right</HI> or not (which is not my business here to determine) it matters not in the present case: 'tis evident they are the doings of the <HI>civil authority,</HI> and of that ALONE.</Q> p. 56, 59.</P>
<P>On which I would remark
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. That ministers influence in those affairs is too well known, by
<PB N="41" REF="012655_0040_0F8BBF0F8AF3CD70"/>rulers and people, to admit this assertion for truth.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. What Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has discovered thro' his book, leaves no room to think that he would have left these <HI>facts</HI> undisputed, if he could have found any ground to dispute upon.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. If it was not his business to have endea∣voured to determine whether those prosecutions were <HI>right</HI> or not, what business had he to blame me for exposing them? Nay, he does try to justify them; for the rules concerning the ma∣gistrates power in <HI>matters ecclesiastical,</HI> which were laid down by former <HI>ministers,</HI> he now declares with "judgment and excellency of spirit;" p. 59. and the prosecutions referred to, were exactly according to the <HI>spirit</HI> of them rules, as I shall have further occasion to shew to him.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. To avoid the name of using <HI>force</HI> to sup∣port religion, he calls the contracts made with minister's <HI>civil covenants,</HI> and the proceedings of the civil state to collect the same, <Q>acts of the civil state done for <HI>its own utility.</HI></Q> p. 56.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>I observed that the <HI>offerings</HI> of the people, out of which ancient ministers were fed, were as dif∣ferent from civil contracts, as their own houses were from the temple. Ex. p. 79. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says, my consequence is <HI>false:</HI> and to prove it, he in∣stances in the contract of a people with a work∣man to build or repair a meeting-house, which he observes is for <HI>religious worship,</HI> yet the con∣tract is intirely of a <HI>civil nature;</HI> and after some reasonings upon it he says, <Q>Let the service done, be what it will, spiritual, civil or secular, 'tis solely the <HI>consideration</HI> in the covenant that denominates it. If the <HI>consideration</HI> be money
<PB N="42" REF="012655_0041_0F8BBF1047346BE0"/>or worldly substance, 'tis a civil covenant; in that the <HI>material cause</HI> of it, is worldly property, and is under the care of the civil state.</Q> p. 94. And after citing several passages concerning the Jewish worship he says, <Q>Had not those cove∣nants, which required a certain sum, viz. tithes and offerings for the Lord's ministers, been of a civil or political nature, what right or authority would those civil rulers, Moses and Nehemiah, have had to intermeddle with them; to reprove and correct the people for breaking or neglecting them; and on the whole, to <HI>oblige</HI> them to render to priests and Levites their due.</Q> p. 96.</P>
<P>Answer
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. As one if not both of them, were prophets, as well as rulers, and as all the people were required, <HI>in any wise to rebuke their neigh∣bour, and not suffer sin upon him.</HI> Levit. 19.17. Is it not surprising to hear a professed minister of the word, ask what right Moses and Nehemiah had to <HI>reprove</HI> people, unless it were in things civil and political!</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. The instance that eh brings of Moses, is a reproof, not of the <HI>people,</HI> but of the <HI>priests,</HI> for neglecting their duty in the <HI>priests office.</HI> p. 96; and if that was political, how came Mr. <HI>F.</HI> to say of the Jews, <Q>Their civil &amp; religious <HI>officers</HI> were <HI>different</HI> setts of men, performing different services, and maintaining as <HI>distinct authority</HI> in their respective provinces, as now takes place, or SHOULD DO, in congre∣gational churches and civil communities.</Q> p. 56. I have before produced instances, both of kings and prophets, reproving and stirring up, priests and people, each to their respective duties concerning religious worship; but does that make, either its performance, or its support to
<PB N="43" REF="012655_0042_0F8BBF111B5B1510"/>be <HI>political</HI> matters?</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. The instance for illus∣tration which our author brings is not to the purpose; for a man or a society have right to contract with what workmen they please, to build a house to meet in for worship, and upon such terms as they can agree upon, which contract has the same force with other civil engagements; and there is no more of the nature of religion in the stones and timber of the meeting-house, nor in the workmen's hewing and placing of them, than there is in other houses. But will Mr. <HI>F.</HI> hold it to be so with his <HI>bodily exercise,</HI> when he "reads, writes, visits, prays or preaches?" p. 94. If he, or any other minister, will honestly own, that their exercise and labour in those things, has no more of the <HI>nature</HI> of <HI>religion</HI> in it, than there is in a carpenter or mason's building a meet∣ing-house; and if people will then contract with them for a <HI>certain sum,</HI> to perform such exercise, let them pay it: but then call them <HI>political mi∣nisters,</HI> and not ministers of Christ. If the <HI>consi∣deration</HI> and <HI>material cause</HI> in the covenant, be∣tween a minister and his people be, (as he asserts) <HI>worldly property,</HI> they deserve no better name.</ITEM>

<P>Men have liberty to teach their sons what trade they think best; and their sons, when of age, have liberty to follow that or other business, as people will employ them, and they can find the best pay; but no man in the Jewish church might be a <HI>priest</HI> except he were <HI>called of God, as was Aaron.</HI> And the means of their support, as has been already shewn, were <HI>offered</HI> and <HI>consecrated</HI> to God. And no Israelite could make an accep∣table prayer, for God to <HI>bless,</HI> either his <HI>people</HI> or the <HI>land</HI> he had given them, unless the man could say, <HI>I have brought away the hallowed things out
<PB N="44" REF="012655_0043_0F8BBF11C58B4408"/>of mine house, and also have given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the fatherless and widow, according to all</HI> THY COMMANDMENTS. Deut. 26.13—15. Note, he must be able to say, <HI>I have brought,</HI> and also <HI>have given;</HI> not, others have <HI>taken</HI> what I could keep no longer. Those who said, <HI>Thou shalt give it me now, and if not, I will take it by force,</HI> acted under priests who were <HI>sons of Beliel,</HI> whose sin was <HI>very great before the Lord; for men abhorred the offering of the Lord.</HI> 1. Sam. 2.12—17. And their father told them the difference, between this and common injustice, saying, "If one man sin against ano∣ther, the <HI>judge shall judge him;</HI> but if a man <HI>sin against the</HI> LORD, who shall intreat for him? ver. 25.</P>
<P>Is it possible for any words to distinguish more plainly than these do, the difference between civil judge's work, and these religious affairs? Unjust dealings of one man against another are sins against God, and he has armed the magistrate with the sword to redress such wrongs; but the affairs of worship, both as to officers and people, lie directly between Him and them. And it is but <HI>lip service,</HI> when their <HI>fear toward him is taught by the pre∣cept of men.</HI> Yea it is <HI>vain worship,</HI> and only a <HI>pretence,</HI> by which they would cover injustice and cruelty toward others. Isa. 29.13. Mat. 15.5—9. and 23.14.</P>
<P>When great stores had been brought in by the people, in Hezekiah's time, he, in conjuction with the chief ruler of the temple, gave orders to secure them and appointed men to oversee and dis∣tribute the same, according to the divine com∣mandment. 2 Chron. 31.11, 13—21. And
<PB N="45" REF="012655_0044_0F8BBF12D4C68310"/>who can say any thing against rulers doing the like now?</P>
<P>But what is there in all this, to favor their as∣sessing the people to support ministers, and using <HI>force</HI> to collect it? Indeed my opponent does not like this word, and the facts that I related agreable to it, he calls "horrible things." p. 111. And he chuses the more soft and ambiguous word, <HI>oblige.</HI> p. 63, 96. Tho' if he had felt the effect of it as much as we have, I am persuaded that <HI>force,</HI> and <HI>violence</HI> added to the end of it, would appear to him mild enough to set their conduct in its true light.</P>
<P>I before declared, that the scripture is abun∣dantly clear for a <HI>free</HI> support of ministers, but not a <HI>forced</HI> one; and observed, that there is as much difference between them, as there is between the power of <HI>truth</HI> in the mind, and the power of the <HI>sword</HI> on the body. Ex. p. 27. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> is so far from concurring with that obser∣vation, that he says, I <HI>corrupted</HI> the sense of Mat. 11.5, only because I said, We used to <HI>think</HI> the gospel was preached <HI>freely to the poor.</HI> The word <HI>freely,</HI> he says, is not in the text. p. 64. I did not say, it was expressed there, but in the preceeding page I had quoted Christ's orders to his ministers, <HI>Freely ye have received, freely give.</HI> Mat. 10.8, 14. Ex. p. 24, 25. which I conclu∣ded they obeyed: but Mr. <HI>F.</HI> would have it, that these orders had <HI>no reference</HI> to preaching, but only to working miracles. p. 61. and the word <HI>freely</HI> he says, <Q>Is a <HI>capital</HI> word in the present dispute; the controversy in this place turns upon it.</Q> p. 64, 65. So it does; and where he will turn to save his scheme I know not;
<PB N="46" REF="012655_0045_0F8BBF13675F77C0"/>for he had declared, that the false apostles <HI>gloried</HI> in preaching <HI>freely,</HI> to prove which he brought 2 Cor. 11.12. But I attempted to shew that their glorying was in things of another nature; that as Paul, when he first came to Corinth, wrought at tent-making, on weak days, and preached on the sabbath, <HI>not with enticing words of man's wisdom:</HI> they <HI>commended themselves,</HI> and said of him, <HI>His bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible.</HI> Ex. p. 25. This interpreta∣tion Mr. <HI>F.</HI> dislikes; and in order to prove that the <HI>false</HI> apostles gloried in preaching <HI>freely,</HI> he has fully proved that the <HI>true</HI> apostle did so; and if he could have brought the text to say, <HI>Wherein</HI> WE <HI>glory,</HI> instead of, <HI>wherein</HI> THEY <HI>glory,</HI> it would have answered his end; but that was beyond his power. p. 66, 69. Therefore I think the argument stands thus: Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says, Christ's order to his apostles, <HI>Freely give,</HI> had <HI>no reference to preaching,</HI> and that I corrupted a text, by saying, We <HI>thought</HI> they preached so; yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has clearly proved that a <HI>true</HI> apostle did <HI>glory</HI> in <HI>preaching freely,</HI> but has failed of proving any such thing of the <HI>false</HI> ones!</P>
<P>The reason he gives for confining the word <HI>freely</HI> to working miracles, in Christ's order to his first ministers, is because he says, <HI>The workman is worthy of his meat;</HI> and, the <HI>labourer is worthy of his hire;</HI> which words, <HI>workmen</HI> and <HI>labourer,</HI> are in other places used concerning common mi∣nisterial labours, where no miracles are in questi∣on. Be it so, yet 'tis nothing to his purpose, for the verse he quotes which says, The labourer is worthy of hire, also describes how they should come at it, namely, by receiving <HI>such things as
<PB N="47" REF="012655_0046_0F8BBF194CE5C200"/>they give.</HI> Luke 10.7. And the texts that he adds with our fathers comments thereon, all speak the same language. 1 Cor. 9.9—14. which says, <HI>Even so hath the Lord ordained;</HI> refers to ancient ministers being maintained out of the <HI>offerings</HI> of the people. And Gal. 6.6, says, <HI>Let him that is taught in the word, communicate unto him that teacheth, in all good-things.</HI> Not let the collector <HI>take it,</HI> if he will <HI>not give it.</HI> Next they cite a passage which says, <HI>As God hath prospered him.</HI> What is to be done as God hath prospered him? answer, a <HI>collection</HI> of <HI>liberality for the saints at Jerusalem.</HI> 1 Cor. 16, 1—3. These are our ministers proofs for not being maintained by <HI>free gift;</HI> to which they add Neh. 13.11. to prove that <Q>when the church power cannot attain the end, the magistrate is to see that the ministry be duly provided for.</Q> p. 63. The text shews that Nehemiah used reproofs and expostulations in the affair; and the effect was this: <HI>Then bro't all Judah the tithe. All</HI> Judah were their own collectors; and it proves clearly, that Nehemiah used his influence by reproof, instruction and good example, to move both ministers and peo∣ple, faithfully to discharge their respective duties in religion: and Oh that all rulers, and subjects too, would do the like!</P>
<P>But, say our ministers, it is a <HI>due debt,</HI> therefore if the people will not pay it, the magistrate is to interpose and <HI>oblige</HI> them to do it. p. 63. Answer, both ministers and people <HI>owe</HI> their all to God, and when they have done all that he has com∣manded, they ought to realize and acknowledge, that they are <HI>unprofitable servants.</HI> He has plain∣ly described in his word, both what ministers, and
<PB N="48" REF="012655_0047_0F8BBF1BD301A960"/>what people are to do, relating to his worship; and says to each, <HI>I know thy works.</HI> And <HI>with him we have to do.</HI> Heb. 4.13. And when he says, <HI>Let him that is taught in the word, communi∣cate to him that teacheth in all good things;</HI> to enforce it he says, <HI>Be not deceived,</HI> GOD IS NOT MOCKED; <HI>for whatsoever a man soweth that shall he reap.</HI> Gal. 6.6—7.</P>
<P>It is in vain to mince the matter. I am as sensible as Mr. <HI>F.</HI> is, that the body is much exer∣cised in ministerial labours, and that God has commanded his people to communicate to them of their <HI>carnal things;</HI> yet the obedience of both, is what they <HI>owe to God,</HI> who can either prosper or blast them as he pleases; yea, can <HI>this night require the soul of him who layeth up treasure for</HI> HIMSELF, <HI>and is not</HI> RICH TOWARDS GOD. Luke 12.20—21. And if <HI>money</HI> or <HI>worldly property,</HI> be the <HI>consideration</HI> in the covenant between any minister and his people, what are they doing but <HI>sowing to the flesh?</HI> therefore <HI>be not deceived.</HI></P>
<P>The sum of the matter is evidently this. All orders of men ought to do what they can in their several stations to promote religion, by speaking and practising the <HI>truth in love,</HI> but have no war∣rant to use any force therein: the exact limits between ecclesiastical and civil government being this, That the <HI>church</HI> is armed with <HI>light</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> to pull down satan's strong holds, and gain souls to Christ, and into his church, to be gover∣ned by his rules therein; and again to exclude such from their communion, who will not be so governed: while the <HI>state</HI> is armed with the <HI>sword</HI> to guard the peace, and civil rights of all
<PB N="49" REF="012655_0048_0F8BBF1CAC242FA8"/>persons and societies, and to <HI>revenge</HI> and <HI>execute wrath</HI> on those who violate the same.</P>
<P>And if none but <HI>Sons of Beliel</HI> ever presumed, even under the <HI>legal</HI> dispensation, so far to inter∣fere between God and his people, about support∣ing ministers, as to say, if you will not <HI>give</HI> it I will <HI>take it by force;</HI> how great must their blind∣ness be, who can presume to do so, under the dispensation which is <HI>purely evangelical!</HI> And I earnestly beseech my dear countrymen, to consi∣der how <HI>inexcusable</HI> we shall appear in <HI>judging,</HI> if we continue to do, not the <HI>same</HI> but <HI>worse</HI> things, than we <HI>condemn</HI> in others!</P>
<P>How much have our rulers, ministers and peo∣ple, complained of <HI>oppression,</HI> because of the at∣tempts that have been made, against the right of <HI>giving</HI> our money, either by ourselves or our representatives, to support government! but if the right thus to <HI>give</HI> it, is essential to <HI>liberty</HI> in <HI>civil</HI> government, where <HI>force</HI> belongs (as I believe it is) what oppression must it be, to deprive any of the <HI>liberty</HI> of <HI>giving</HI> their money <HI>freely</HI> to pro∣mote <HI>religion,</HI> where <HI>force</HI> has no place at all! And as we have proved it to be contrary to our Lord's commandment, to call any man on earth <HI>master</HI> or <HI>father,</HI> it being impossible for us to con∣stitute another to answer for us at his bar; there∣fore we connot convey a right to a representative to <HI>compel</HI> any person, either to attend, or to sup∣port a worship contrary to his conscience. And our fathers example in these things, will condemn, rather than excuse us, in so doing; for while they thought <HI>force</HI> was warrantable in such affairs, they were zealous in the <HI>compelling</HI> persons to <HI>conform,</HI> to what they esteemed the right way of
<PB N="50" REF="012655_0049_0F8BBF1D055520A8"/>worship, as well as to <HI>support</HI> it: and if the for∣mer was persecution, what cloak can be left for the latter! Some tell us, that money is not conscience: that we know as well as they, but they &amp; all will know, sooner or later, that we all are but <HI>stewards</HI> of what we profess, and must give account thereof to the great Lord of all; con∣sequently it must be a matter of conscience to those who view things as they are, not voluntarily to support a worship, which they believe is not right. And as a <HI>widow</HI> who suffered in this cause, which I before mentioned, Ex. p. 21, is now gone beyond the frowns and flatteries of men, I will give the reader her testimony, of what she experienced in her sufferings, as she wrote the same with her own hand on Nov. 4. 1752, in these words. <Q>October 15, the collectors came to our house, and took me away to prison, about 9 o'clock in a dark rainy night. Bro∣thers H. and S. were brought there the next night. We lay in prison 13 days, and then were set at liberty, by what means I know not. Whilst I was there a great many people came to see me, and some said one thing, and some another: O! the innumerable snares and temptations that beset me, more than I ever tho't on before! But O, the condescention of heaven! tho' I was bound when I was cast into this furnace, yet was I loosed, and found Jesus in the midst of the furnace with me. O! then I could give up my name, estate, family, life and breath, freely to God. Now the prison look'd like a palace to me. I could bless God for all the laughs and scoffs made at me. O! the love that flowed out to all mankind! then I
<PB N="51" REF="012655_0050_0F8BBF1DCB99B230"/>could forgive, as I would desire to be forgi∣ven, and love my neighbour as myself. Dea∣con G. was put in prison the 8th of October, and yesterday old brother G. and they are in pur∣suit of others; all which calls for <HI>humiliation.</HI> This church has appointed the 13th of No∣vember to be spent in <HI>prayer</HI> and <HI>fasting</HI> on that account. I remember my love to you and your wife, and the dear children of God with you, begging your <HI>prayers</HI> for us in such a day of trial.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here note, Mr. <HI>F.</HI> in his sermons says, <Q>The true church of Christ, in whom his spirit dwells, has never been a bitter, fierce, revengeful, <HI>persecuting</HI> church; but the reverse.</Q> And tries to fix these odious characters upon the separates, because they sometimes called such mi∣nisters as he is pleading for, <HI>hirelings,</HI> and <HI>blind leaders;</HI> which he says, was done with an air of <HI>glorying</HI> rather than <HI>mourning.</HI> p. 47, 155. The reader will now judge what regard is to be paid to his witness in <HI>his own cause:</HI> and also who behaved most like the true church under trouble. Esther 4. 1—3.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Their prayers were heard, so that such oppres∣sions soon ceased in that place, and have not been practised there in that manner since; tho' they are continued in other parts of the land. But if any will yet continue to <HI>devour widows houses,</HI> to uphold a <HI>pretence</HI> of religion, I trust this widow's testimony will be a witness against them another day. We come,</P>
<P N="5">V. To consider what are, and what are not, <HI>just reasons for separation.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>F.</HI> accuses the body of the separates with being <HI>truce-breakers;</HI> but his proof of their being such, all turns upon this point, viz. <Q>Whereas they promised, to walk with us in holy fellow∣ship,
<PB N="52" REF="012655_0051_0F8BBF1E87094118"/>in all gospel ordinances, they openly re∣nounced communion with us, when <HI>we</HI> the standing churches, were daily attending these ordinances of Christ, agreable to his instituti∣on.</Q> Ser. p. 173. And now, as I had set down in my title page, Dr. <HI>Owen's</HI> saying, That he who will not separate from the <HI>world</HI> and <HI>false worship,</HI> is a separate from Christ; Mr. <HI>F.</HI> allows the sentence to be undoubted truth, and says, it <Q>Makes directly against the people for whom Mr. <HI>B.</HI> is going to plead.</Q> p. 17. Let this matter therefore be carefully examined.</P>
<P>And.</P>
<P N="1">I. I think we have already produced suffici∣ent proof, that according to Christ's institution, none ought to be received into the church without gospel evidence of their saving union to the great Head of it. The Jewish church was distinguished from the nations of the <HI>world</HI> by their being <HI>chosen</HI> of God as a <HI>nation,</HI> and by the ordinances that he gave to keep them distinct from all other nations; But our Lord has bro∣ken down that wall of <HI>partition;</HI> and through the new-testament he distinguishes his church from the world, by <HI>choosing them out of the world,</HI> and giv∣ing them to <HI>know God</HI> which is <HI>eternal life,</HI> whom the <HI>world hath not known.</HI> John 15.19. and 17.3, 25.1 John 5.19, 20. In the Jewish cove∣nant they were chosen in their <HI>family</HI> and <HI>national</HI> capacity; but the gospel covenant is <HI>not accord∣ing</HI> to that, and the difference described is, <HI>All shall know God, from the least to the greatest.</HI> Yet the first thing that Mr. <HI>F.</HI> advanced to prove, that his brethren had not the spirit of Christ, but the reverse, in separating from his church, is he says,
<PB N="53" REF="012655_0052_0F8BBF1F606AB8A8"/><Q>They endeavoured to draw off from us every <HI>true believer,</HI> and would have left a congrega∣tion behind them, of nothing but such as they judged to be hypocrites and graceless persons. —Surely this is not according to Christ's di∣rection, <HI>Let both grow together until the har∣vest.</HI></Q> Ser. p. 154.</P>
<P>Now observe, the <HI>field</HI> wherein Christ said, Let both grow together, he says is <HI>The world;</HI> and this direction was given when both wheat and tares <HI>appeared</HI> by their <HI>fruit:</HI> how impossi∣ble then must it be, for those ministers and churches to be duly separated from the <HI>world,</HI> who apply to the <HI>church</HI> what Christ said of the <HI>world?</HI> And let it be particularly noted, that the crime charged by Mr. <HI>F.</HI> upon his brethren, is their endeavouring to separate <HI>true believers</HI> from such as <HI>they judged</HI> to be graceless persons; and acting according to <HI>their judgment</HI> in thus separa∣ting the church from the world, he declares to be contrary to Christ's direction. And so did all the ministers of Windham county; for they not only brought the parable of the tares, and many others for the same end that our author does, but also, after declaring it to be the design of Christ to <Q>make his saints, and the <HI>ordinances</HI> of his visible Kingdom to be the means of the <HI>conver∣sion</HI> of others,</Q> represent that ministers and christians cannot let their <HI>light shine</HI> as they ought before men, when they will have <Q>No <HI>commu∣nion</HI> with them in the same worship, and the <HI>same ordinances.</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Association letter. p. 16. 17.</NOTE> And for prayer and preach∣ing
<PB N="54" REF="012655_0053_0F8BBF20059DBA98"/>the word, we ever held them to be the means for conversion as much as our opponents, and as freely admit all men to the use of them as they do; but to commune with the world in baptism and the Lord's-supper in order to convert them, this they held and we denied; and this was a principal reason of our separation from them. Yet they say, <Q>That the church ought to keep and cast out all those who by their <HI>fruits</HI> are known to be tares no body denies.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 10.</NOTE></Q> What can all this mean? why in the same place they shew, that by those who are known to be tares, they mean "scandalous persons;" but they go on to say,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">p. 23.</NOTE> <Q>It is the will of Christ, that all those who make an outward credible profession of christianity, should be admitted into his church, and <HI>tho' unconverted</HI> be there <HI>among the wheat,</HI> that they may be under pro∣per <HI>ordinances</HI> for their <HI>conversion.</HI></Q></P>
<P>So Mr. <HI>Stoddard,</HI> while he was pleading for all who were not openly scandalous, to come to the Lord's-supper as a <HI>converting ordinance,</HI> tells us that in the synod of 1679, they had a dispute, whether persons should give <Q>A relation of the WORK OF GOD's SPIRIT upon their <HI>hearts,</HI> in order to coming into full communion.—The result was, that they blotted out the clause, of making a relation of the work of God's spirit, and put in the room of it, The making a <HI>pro∣fession of their faith and repentance;</HI> and so I voted with them, and am of the same judgment still.<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Stoddard's appeal to the learned. p. 94.</NOTE></Q> This general profession, to the exclu∣sion
<PB N="55" REF="012655_0054_0F8BBF24F882BC60"/>of a relation of the <HI>work of God's Spirit on the heart,</HI> was the real state of our difference with them; but as I noted before, Ex. p. 50, this true state of the controversy was industriously shifted, from the <HI>way</HI> of knowing to the <HI>degree</HI> of knowledge. As for instance; Mr. <HI>Elisha Paine</HI> proved from many scriptures, that, <Q>The church is to cast her tares out when they <HI>appear,</HI> or the whole church is leavened.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Windham association letter. p. 10.</NOTE></Q> The ministers of that county would have it that no body denied this, and yet go on to accuse Mr. <HI>Paine</HI> with <HI>abusing</HI> and <HI>perverting</HI> the scriptures, because he held that our Lord's prohibition, <HI>not to root up the tares,</HI> respected the <HI>world</HI> and not the <HI>church.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 11.</NOTE> Thus like the Jewish teachers, they <HI>turn things upside down.</HI> Isa. 29.16. And now Mr. <HI>F.</HI> car∣ries it that my argument is, <Q>That the saints should separate from the sinners, while they are such, and deprive them of the benefit of their prayers, holy example and other means of their conversion.—From a religious <HI>assembly,</HI> and set them elswhereto worship.</Q> p. 114.115. when I said not a word of that nature, and had no more thoughts of such a-separation, than I had of coming into the practice of his party, of sending men to jail if they would not conform to the parish minister.</P>
<P>However all his attempts to <HI>darken counsel</HI> can∣not hide the real state of our controversy, for he says, <Q>Mr. <HI>B.</HI> reads 2 Cor. 6.14.—17. wrong. Be ye separate from UNBELIEVERS, says Mr. <HI>B.</HI> Paul says, <HI>come out from among</HI> THEM, and be separate. From whom? Answer, from
<PB N="56" REF="012655_0055_0F8BBF274AAD17E0"/>visible <HI>heathenish idolatry.</HI></Q> p. 115. But I have a better authority than his, which speaking of Christ's visible church says, <Q>Separation is a proper and inseparable adjunct thereof; the apostle speaks of church membership, 2 Cor. 6.14—15. Be not unequally yoked together (yoked with those of <HI>another kind,</HI> the plowing with an ox and ass together, being forbidden under the law) with <HI>unbelievers, i. e.</HI> visible unbelievers of <HI>any sort or kind;</HI> for what par∣ticipation hath righteousness with unrighte∣ousness?—or what part hath a <HI>believer</HI> with an <HI>unbeliever?</HI> it ought not to be rendered <HI>infidel;</HI> but it was done, to put a blind upon this place, as to its <HI>true intention,</HI> and to countenance <HI>parish communion.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Preface to Dr. Owen's discourse on the <HI>nature of a gospel church.</HI> p. 9, 10.</NOTE></Q> To our grief we see such attempts to <HI>blind</HI> the truth, carried on even to this day. Not a little of this is done by per∣verting the meaning of the word <HI>fruits;</HI> which our Lord explains to be what is brought forth out of the <HI>heart</HI> by <HI>speaking.</HI> Luke 6.44—45. which evidently includes persons, principles and experiences, as their daily conversation; whereas our opponents would have had fruits to mean only heresy and open scandals; and good fruit to be a general assent to truth, attendance upon worship, and a moral life. But they have not been willing to let our principles and reasons for separation stand as we held them, but have re∣ceived and published many accusations against us contrary to truth.</P>
<P N="2">II. Christ's true ministers are all furnished
<PB N="57" REF="012655_0056_0F8BBF27AE712CE8"/>with <HI>spiritual gifts</HI> from him; but many have been set up as ministers in our land, who were not so furnished, while others whom he had fitted for that work were rejected; for the ministry was "Limited to persons of a liberal (<HI>i. e.</HI> college) education," to the exclusion of others who were allowed to be, <Q>in themselves BETTER QUALIFIED for the work of the gospel mi∣nistry than some others that were ordained.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Edwards's thoughts of the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 1742 <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>.</NOTE></Q> And Mr. <HI>F.</HI> declares it to be a <HI>conceit</HI> with ut reason or <HI>truth,</HI> for any now to say, The Lord is raising up and sending forth <HI>unlearned</HI> men. He owns that he did so formerly, and the reason for is that he gives is, because <Q>Christ himself was <HI>personally</HI> present to educate his sons.</Q> Ser. p. 65. I observed that to confine this to his <HI>persono!</HI> presence, struck against his divinity. Ex. p. 65. This Mr. <HI>F.</HI> now represents as exceeding injuri∣ons. p. 88.89. But it is certain that Christ did by his <HI>spirit</HI> give vastly greater gifts to his ministers after the withdrawing his personal presence, than he did before: <HI>gifts</HI> for ordinary as well as ex∣traordinary ministers. Eph. 4.11. And Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> well observes, that after his resurrection he ordered his disciples not to engage in the public work of building his church, till they had received those <HI>gifts.</HI> Acts 1, and says, <Q>Christ would have them look neither for assistance in their work nor success unto it, but from the premised <HI>Spirit alone.</HI> And herein did lie, and now <HI>doth lie</HI> the <HI>foundation</HI> of the <HI>ministry</HI> of the church, as also its <HI>continuance</HI> and efficacy. The king∣dom of Christ is <HI>spiritual,</HI> and in the animacing,
<PB N="58" REF="012655_0057_0F8BBF2885A33108"/>principles of it, <HI>invisible.</HI> If we fix our minds only on outward order, we loose the rise and power of the whole; it is not an outward visible ordination by men, tho' it be necessary by rule and precept, but Christ's <HI>communication of that spirit,</HI> the everlasting promise whereof he receiv∣ed of the father, that gives BEING, <HI>life, use∣fulness,</HI> and <HI>success</HI> to the <HI>ministry.</HI> This is the hinge whereon the <HI>whole weight</HI> of it doth turn and depend unto <HI>this day.</HI></Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Owen on the spirit. p. 156, 157.</NOTE></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>F.</HI> is so far from these sentiments, that in order to justify his applying Isa. 50.4. to human learning, he now calls that learning, <Q>This gift of the spirit;</Q> and says, <Q>Human learning is AS MUCH the gift of God as grace.</Q> p. 87, which discovers what violence some men will offer to language and common sense, rather than yield to conviction. We readily grant, that all our fa∣culties, and all our accomplishments, are God's gifts; but success in the study of languages and the libe∣ral arts are not more so, than skill in husbandry is. Isa. 28.26, 29. Yea, as the former is very con∣versant with heathen fable and sophistry, its subjects are often found not to be so honest as the other. Every thing that can be attained by human instruc∣tion and industry, are but the accomplishments of <HI>natural men,</HI> instead of being <HI>spiritual gifts.</HI> 1 Cor. 2.12—14. and 12.1—11. The forementioned excellent author truely observes,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 217.</NOTE> that the dis∣tinction of natural and spiritual is derived from the Head we are in. The first Adam was made a <HI>living soul,</HI> the last Adam a <HI>quickning spirit;</HI> there∣fore
<PB N="59" REF="012655_0058_0F8BBF290BB22FB8"/>if we are not partakers of his spirit, we have no <HI>spiritual gifts;</HI> nothing higher than the furni∣ture of <HI>natural men.</HI> 1 Cor. 15.45—48. And the grand difference is; one has a supreme regard to God, the other a supreme regard to self, in his doings.</P>
<P N="3">III. Christ constituted his church a <HI>free people,</HI> and he commands them to <HI>stand fast in that liberty.</HI> Gal. 5.1—13. This command we could not obey without separating from the constitution that Mr. <HI>F.</HI> pleads for. For</P>
<P N="1">1. I trust it has already been clearly proved, that he claims a power in ministers to examine and opprobate others, and to limit the church to such candidates; and as a reason for so doing he says, <Q>The gospel furniture of an able and faithful minister of Jesus Christ, in its full latitude, is <HI>above the reach of common people.</HI> Very dan∣gerous and pernicious errors, may lie so deep and concealed, as to require much reading and penetration to discover them, which com∣mon brethren ordinarily have not.</Q> p. 82. Which makes me think of Dr. <HI>Owen's</HI> remarks upon the Pharisees sentence in John 7.49. Yet says the Doctor <Q>Was it <HI>this people</HI> whom the apostles directed to choose out from <HI>among themselves</HI> persons meet for an ecclesiastical of∣fice, Acts 6. The <HI>same people</HI> who joined with the apostles and elders in the consideration of the grand case concerning the continuation of the legal ceremonies, and were associated with them in the determination of it. Acts 15. The <HI>same</HI> to whom all the apostolical epistles, except∣ing some to particular persons, were written, and unto whom such directions were given, and du∣ties
<PB N="60" REF="012655_0059_0F8BBF29D88D6680"/>enjoined in them, as suppose not only a <HI>liberty and ability to judge</HI> for themselves in all matters of faith and obedience, but also an <HI>es∣pecial interest</HI> in the order and discipline of the church: Those who were to say unto Archip∣pus (their bishop) take heed unto the ministry thou hast received in the Lord, that thou fulfil it. Col. 4. Unto whom of all sorts, it is com∣manded that they <HI>examine and try antichrist's spirits</HI> and <HI>false teachers,</HI> that is, <HI>all sorts</HI> of hereticks, heresies and errors, 1 John chapters 2, 3, &amp;c. <HI>That people,</HI> who even in following ages adhered unto the faith and the authodox profession of it, when almost all their bishops were become <HI>Arian hereticks;</HI> and kept their private conventicles in opposition unto them, at Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria and other places.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Original of evangelical churches. p. 295, 296.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>F.</HI> tries hard to persuade his readers, that Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> was for him, and against us, but you may now judge whether the case is not truly the reverse, since the Doctor has so fully proved from the word of truth, that the apostles and elders acted <HI>with the brethren</HI> in all these affairs, and not in a <HI>distinct jurisdiction</HI> from them. But mi∣nisters in the Massachusetts made a formal attempt to introduce such a jurisdiction about 70 years ago; and tho' it did not succeed as they wished there, yet in Connecticut a political governor, who had been a minister, introduced the scheme; and a learned minister who was trained up among them says, <Q>This platform by implication vests a mi∣nister with a negative on the church in all her
<PB N="61" REF="012655_0060_0F8BBF2ADE03D298"/>acts. And in council it has thrown a very great light in their ballance of power into the hands of the ministers, even to more than a negative on the messengers.—Taken literally, it in the first place stipulates the absolute un∣subordinate power of particular churches. It afterwards vests the <HI>consociated council</HI> with au∣thoritative final decision on all matters of disci∣pline submitted to it by the churches of the circuit. It at length vests the council with a general and original <HI>jurisdiction</HI> on ALL <HI>occasions ecclesiastical.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Stiles on the Christian union. p. 71. 72.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>It was for opposing and withdrawing from this jurisdiction, that the representatives of Norwich, were censured by the minister and his party, and by that means were excluded from their place in the general assembly. Ex. p. 29. And this was the jurisdiction that exerted all its power to rob Branford of a good minister, because he ventured to preach among the <HI>baptists</HI> against these minis∣ters wills. Ex. p. 30, 31. And the same that gave "special direction" to the <HI>parish</HI> in Can∣terbury to call and retain one of their candidates, against the minds of the <HI>church,</HI> which occasioned our first separation. Ex. p. 42. Hence</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>constitution</HI> which Mr. <HI>F.</HI> pleads for, has given the <HI>world</HI> a power over the <HI>church,</HI> ab∣solutely inconsistent with gospel <HI>liberty;</HI> and tho' he has exerted all his art to blind this case (as I shall shew in my address to him) yet by his own account it appears, that ministers ordained their candidate at Canterbury, contrary to the judg∣ment of the greater part of the church; and that when they knew that if they did it, it would not be
<PB N="62" REF="012655_0061_0F8BBF2B6C1395A8"/>in their power to prevent the parish from <HI>forcing</HI> the church to support him; and tho' they got the society then to vote their <HI>willingness</HI> that the ge∣neral court should set them off; yet it appears that when the case came there, <Q>The society's attorney objected and said, That it would spoil the society, for if these people were released, the charges would be so heavy upon the rest, that they would forsake the ministers.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Paine's view of the churches. Apology p. 7.</NOTE></Q> Which objection the court heard to, and left the church in the hands of the parish, who imprisoned their persons, or spoiled their goods, to maintain that minister, for more then fifteen years; and then they would not release them only on conditi∣on, that they should pay their part <Q>of the tax, or taxes already granted, to the present esta∣blished minister in said society;</Q> and all that voted for his settlement they refused to release at all as long as he continued their minister. He was ordained in 1744, and this parish vote (as appears from under their clerk's hand) was on April 21, 1760. Yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says of this parish, <Q>As to their religious conduct in the whole affair, there is nothing appears in <HI>them</HI> to denominate them the <HI>world,</HI> any more than in their brethren that are called the <HI>church.</HI></Q> p. 79.</P>
<P>But if to pretend a willingness to release the church till they had got their minister ordained, and then to treat them as they did, be not like the <HI>wicked world,</HI> I desire to know what can be! Yea, and as those ministers then joined with the world in ordaining that minister against the choice of the church, so Mr. <HI>F.</HI> now plainly justifies the world
<PB N="63" REF="012655_0062_0F8BBF3048E0FAD0"/>in prosecuting the churches pastor for marrying; and says, <Q>Setting up in opposition to the stand∣ing churches, their pastor was not an officer known, either in church or state.</Q> p. 80.</P>
<P>Now kind reader see where we are. This was a regular church till the clergy and the world obliged them, either to take a minister contrary to their judgments, or to leave the meeting-house; and because they never petitioned the <HI>civil</HI> powers to form them into a "religious society," but only to be exempted from oppression from others, Mr. <HI>F.</HI> calls them <HI>separates, irregular,</HI> &amp;c. p. 76. 79. Therefore if these ministers did not <HI>cause division and offences, contrary to the gospel.</HI> I de∣sire to know whoever did! and we are commanded to <HI>mark and avoid</HI> such. Rom. 16.17.</P>
<P>I before quoted Dr. <HI>Owen's</HI> observation concern∣ing national churches, that tho' they talk of <HI>liberty of conscience,</HI> yet when it comes to the issue, all choice is prevented, and in the church where a man was <HI>baptized in infancy,</HI> and in the <HI>parish</HI> where his habitation falls, in that <HI>parish-church</HI> he must worship, or be dealt with as a <HI>schismatick.</HI> Then I produced this case at Canterbury, and proved, that two members of that church were dealt with and expelled Yale-college as schismat∣icks, only for meeting for worship with the church they belonged to, in a place separate from the pa∣rish meeting-house; and those who expelled them declared to the world that, <Q>Neither the major part of the members in full communion, nor <HI>any other persons,</HI> in any parish, have <HI>any right</HI> to appoint any house or place for worship on the sabbath, <HI>separate</HI> from, and in opposition to the meeting-house, the public place appointed
<PB N="64" REF="012655_0063_0F8BBF329AA63848"/>by the general assembly and the parish.</Q> This I observed, makes the general assembly lawgivers for the church, and the parish executors of it. Ex. p. 83.84.</P>
<P>But Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says <Q>That relates ONLY to the <HI>placing</HI> of meeting-houses,—and so is a matter of a <HI>civil</HI> nature; but don't so much as <HI>touch</HI> the principles, the order, discipline and govern∣ment of the churches;</Q> and he asserts that my last sentence is "evidently void of TRUTH." p. 103, 104. What! does the <HI>parish's</HI> forcing the <HI>church</HI> to hear a man they were not edified by, or else to leave the meeting-house, and then ministers and colleges, treating them as schismaticks for so doing, not <HI>touch</HI> the <HI>principles</HI> and <HI>government</HI> of the churches! What amazing blindness is here discovered!</P>
<P>By Mr. <HI>F's</HI> own account, a certain quantity of worldly estate gives every inhabitant power, by their constitution, to vote for ministers, and all the ad∣vantage that the members in full communion have above the rest is that they may vote with the world if they have no estate; and he says <Q>All vote in our parishes, as men <HI>qualified by law;</HI> and as Mr. <HI>B.</HI> brings in the <HI>clergy</HI> with the <HI>world,</HI> with a design to do them a mischief, he makes a terrible overthrow; slaying clergy and laity, standing churches and separates, all with one stroke: but no matter for that—if the ministers &amp;their churches may but fall, he seems willing that he and his brethren, <HI>Sampson-like</HI> should die with the <HI>Philistines.</HI></Q> p. 83, 84. This is a sort of <HI>rhetoric</HI> that some bring in to supply the want of argument. I well know that in civil affairs, christians vote with others by virtue of their
<PB N="65" REF="012655_0064_0F8BBF32C6EF5460"/>civil and <HI>worldly</HI> qualifications; but as the gospel ministry is a <HI>spiritual</HI> office, men ought to have <HI>spiritual</HI> qualifications in order to vote for them; and this <HI>confounding</HI> of church and world together in such affairs, is a <HI>Babel</HI> which must and will come down. Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> says, <Q>Where the <HI>fun∣damentals</HI> of religious worship are corrupted or overthrown, it is absolutely <HI>unlawful</HI> to join unto, or <HI>abide in</HI> any church.</Q> And the first of these <HI>fundamentals</HI> that he names is, <Q>That all ministers or officers of it, be duly chosen by the <HI>church itself.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Original of churches. p. 180, 181.</NOTE></Q> And Dr. <HI>In∣crease Mather</HI> says, <Q>It would be <HI>Simonical</HI> to affirm that this sacred privilege (of voting for a pastor) may be purchased with <HI>money,</HI> or that contributions can entitle to it.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Vindication of the order of the churches. p. 67.</NOTE></Q> And he names a number of principles, which if we es∣pouse, he says we then give away the <HI>whole con∣gregational cause;</HI> on of which is,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Preface. p. 8.</NOTE> <Q>That persons not qualified for communion in speci∣al ordinances, shall ELECT PASTORS FOR CHUR∣CHES.</Q></P>
<P>Here note, under the Massachusetts first char∣ter, none were allowed to vote for officers, either in church or state, but members in full commu∣nion; but a turn of times in that respect happen∣ed a little before these words were written; and the apostacy had now prevailed so far, that we were obliged to separate from the <HI>world,</HI> who had usurped such a power over the <HI>church,</HI> or else give away the <HI>whole congregational cause.</HI> And as the heads of the college declared, That the parish in
<PB N="66" REF="012655_0065_0F8BBF33D798B1F8"/>Canterbury had <Q>the special direction of the association,</Q> in keeping that minister. Ex. p. 42. therefore it was not I that <HI>yoked</HI> the <HI>clergy</HI> with the <HI>world,</HI> as Mr. <HI>F.</HI> terms it; for I only remarked what they had done themselves. And now he asserts, that the divine command, <HI>Be not unequally yoked,</HI> but <HI>be ye separate,</HI> means from <HI>heathens,</HI> and not from <HI>unbelievers</HI> in general, p. 115. We therefore could not be free from that <HI>yoke</HI> which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear, without separating from them. We have often heard them talk of separating <HI>godliness</HI> or religion by these means, but the evident de∣sign is <HI>gain;</HI> and the command is <HI>From such withdraw thyfelf.</HI> 1 Tim. 6.5. The above were the main causes of our separation, tho' other points that are connected therewith had their in∣fluence.</P>
<P>Unwarranted ways of worship, is one reason that Dr. <HI>Owen</HI> gives for separation. This Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says, <Q>I never heard objected even by our separating brethren (as I remember) nor is their any shadow of reason for the charge.</Q> p. 104. Yet he did inform us that his brethren urged the <Q>Half-way covenant as a sufficient reason for their separating.</Q> But tells us that they <HI>improperly</HI> called it <HI>half way,</HI> and says, <Q>it is <HI>full</HI> and <HI>compleat,</HI> binding them to <HI>observe all things whatsoever the Lord our God has com∣manded.</HI></Q> While his next words shew, that he leads persons thus to covenant to <HI>observe all,</HI> when he knows they do not mean <HI>all;</HI> that they do not mean to come to the Lord's table, for want of sufficient improvement in <Q>experimental godliness.</Q> Ser. p. 92. And what can this
<PB N="67" REF="012655_0066_0F8BBF344CF2E548"/>be but <HI>false worship?</HI> yea lying to God! Ano∣ther way of worship he tells us that his brethren did object against, and he owns he did practice, which is, <Q>writing down <HI>all</HI> that he judged expedient to deliver at that time, and then <HI>praying</HI> for assistance.</Q> Ser. p. 149. These ways of worship he has told the world that his brethren did object against, and yet now he can't remember any such thing, which shews how hard it is to remember or retain in mind, any thing that condemns self.</P>
<P>Neglect of <HI>evangelical</HI> discipline in the church∣es, and turning it into a <HI>worldly dominion,</HI> is ano∣ther reason for separation. Ex. p. 87. But Mr. <HI>F.</HI> asserts that it is not applicable to his church∣es. p. 101—104. Whether the foregoing facts do not prove the case to be otherwise, notwith∣standing his witness in his own cause, the reader must judge.</P>
<P>The next article is Dr. <HI>Franck's</HI> saying that, <Q>Carnal preachers under the influence of pride and ambition, interpret whatever is done to their persons, as an assault against their <HI>holy function,</HI> pouring forth their malice and bitter∣ness upon all those, who, they suppose have affronted them,</Q> &amp;c. Ex. p. 84. And I produced the words of sixteen of our author's brethren in the ministry, in what he now calls an <HI>excellent letter,</HI> wherein they accuse those who separated <HI>from them,</HI> with holding a principle which implied, <Q>That there is NO <HI>instituted mi∣nistry,</HI> or order of men, peculiarly appointed to that work in the christian church.</Q> While the same men exerted all their power, to prevent our churches having <HI>ordained ministers.</HI> Ex. p. 47.
<PB N="68" REF="012655_0067_0F8BBF350A9146C8"/>89. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the same <HI>letter</HI> p. 42, 43. they compare the going to worship, with such as they call <HI>lay-teachers,</HI> to following those who worship <HI>other gods,</HI> Deut. 13, and say <Q>The arguments against your compliance is the same—and if there seem to be never so many appearances of God's power attending it, you may not go after it, any more than for the like reason, you may not go after a <HI>false god.</HI></Q> If this be not a forbidding those who <HI>follow not them,</HI> what can be so called! Mark 9.38.</NOTE> I also referred him to seven other minis∣ters in his own county, who in a printed <HI>alarm</HI> to the world, compare our withdrawing <HI>from them,</HI> to <HI>Core's</HI> gainsaying <HI>Moses</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> who were called immediately from heaven. Ex. p. 23. And now Mr. <HI>F.</HI> declares that the <HI>pastor</HI> of the church in Canterbury, <Q>was not an officer known, either in church or state,</Q> only because he was not set up <Q>according to the <HI>constitution,</HI> of the country.</Q> p. 80. Though by the way, the honorable justices of the superior court in the Massachusetts province, have often, in cases bro't before them, determined that ours are as truly <HI>ordained ministers</HI> as theirs are.</P>
<P>Yet notwithstanding all the evidence that I produced, Mr. <HI>F.</HI> says, <Q>Our real character is <HI>as different</HI> from that which he has set up, as the true protestant churches are from the an∣tichristian; or as the apostle <HI>Peter</HI> was from the <HI>Pope</HI> of Rome.</Q> p. 102. But the reader will judge, whether accusing us with holding to, NO <HI>instituted ministry,</HI> and with being guilty of the <HI>gainsaying of Core,</HI> only because we <HI>followed not them,</HI> be as far from interpreting what is done to their <HI>persons,</HI> as an assault against their <HI>holy function,</HI> as Peter was from the Pope or not; or whether our separation, as above described, was
<PB N="69" REF="012655_0068_0F8BBF3630FB5A38"/>not truly from the <HI>world</HI> &amp; <HI>false worship;</HI> for no o∣ther than such a separation do I pretend to justify.</P>
<P>A few remarks shall close this head. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. It is not doubted but that many have come out from those called standing churches in our land, who did not act upon these principles, but have been influenced by ourward appearances, or unreasonable impressions, rather than an un∣derstanding regard to divine truth? and which has caused a great deal of trouble and searching trials among us, and given occasion to our ene∣mies. Yet all the errors in the world cannot overthrow the truth, nor excuse us if we do not obey it; and it is so far from being <HI>truce-breaking,</HI> to withdraw from ministers and churches, when we see that they grossly swerve from the truth, and will not be reclaimed, that we can not keep covenant, either with God or them, but by such a withdraw.</P>
<P N="2">2. This our opponents allow, but deny our having any such cause to withdraw from them. And to try to support their argument, they col∣lect all the good things, or good pretences that they can find on their side; and then all the errors and evils that they can see or hear of among sepa∣rates. But what work would it make, if we should requite them in the same way, and draw their character to the world from the false-teaching. lying, whoredoms, drunkenness and other abomi∣nations, that in fact have happened among their ministers and churches! yet there would be as much justice in so doing, as in a very great part of what they have done to us in these affairs. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> told the world, that his design was to draw the separates <HI>pictures to the life,</HI> that they
<PB N="70" REF="012655_0069_0F8BBF36BA494F78"/>might be ashamed. Ser. p. 130. In doing of which he collected the worst things that he could find among any that bore the name; yea, I am told by a gentleman of note in Stonington, that one instance of ill treatment to him which he has published, was from a woman that never was of either the separate church or society, only as she happened to live then at one of their houses. At the same time he says, <Q>I know not of <HI>one</HI> princi∣ple or practice among them, that is agreable to the gospel, but what they <HI>learned in our chur∣ches.</HI>" Ser. p. 113. Whatever good things they have among them, they have them not <HI>as separates,</HI>—the things that I have told you of above, are their <HI>characteristicks.</HI></Q> Ser. p. 160.</P>
<P>Since he talks so much about learning, I think to make a little trial of what some of their rules of logic will do in this affair; as thus,</P>
<P>Every cause will produce its own effects. Mr. <HI>F.</HI> gives a dreadful account of how roughly the separates treated him, soon after they came out of the standing churches. But when they had been out above 20 years, he says <Q>They are now, much more moderate and civil, than they were in that day; are very peacable, kind, obliging good neighbours.</Q> Ser. p. 157, 158.</P>
<P>Ergo, they have received better teaching since they came out than they had before. Again,</P>
<P>Take away the cause, and the effect will cease, Mr. <HI>F.</HI> tells the world, that the special occasion of publishing his sermons, was <Q>The revival of the spirit of separation and annabaptism.</Q> Pre∣face. p. 3.</P>
<P>Ergo, the spirit of our separation when revi∣ved, was a spirit of civility, peace and good nei∣bourhood,
<PB N="71" REF="012655_0070_0F8BBF3B31B61AD0"/>and all his representations to the con∣trary are unjust and abusive, for which he is con∣demned out of his own mouth.</P>
<P N="3">3. The only way to bring this controversy to a fair issue, is to examine the true nature and effects of our professed principles, or shew wherein we do not act agreable to them. This I have aim∣ed at in all these labours, and desire others to do the same with me. If any man can shew us where∣in we hold any wrong principle, or in a friendly manner correct any disagreable practice, he will do us a real kindness; but to charge us with any thing that we are conscious we do not hold, can never convince us that we are wrong, or they right.</P>
<P N="4">4. It has ever been satan's method, when he could no longer keep people easy with the dead carcase of religion, than to promote in some, great pretences of spirituality which are not true; which formalists have never failed to improve as an argument against reformation. How much have papists used this argument against protes∣tants, and episcopalians against puritans and dis∣senters? And is not the same now used against us? That there has been much enthusiasm, and many false pretences to spirituality in our day, is a melancholy fact; but it is quite as injurious to lay the blame thereof to the main principles, or chief leaders of our separation, as it would be to the chief instruments of the revival of religion in 1741; for there were as bad or worse things of that nature, that happened before our separa∣tion, than have since. Therefore it appeared needful thus to trace matters up to their original, and to set principles and facts in as clear light
<PB N="72" REF="012655_0071_0F8BBF3D93D7F0D8"/>as might be, not only to vindicate our sentiments and characters, against our learned opponents, but also to detect the false pretences of some, who are ready to separate from their brethren upon every turn of affairs, yet pretending to stand and act in the same cause we first came out upon. And this is no new thing; for even in the apostles days, after they had earnestly appeared for truth and gospel liberty, and for deliverance from Jewish and heathen bondage, some took occasion under the name of <HI>liberty</HI> to <HI>dispise go∣vernment;</HI> who notwithstanding their great <HI>swel∣ling words,</HI> were really <HI>servants of corruption.</HI> 2 Pet. 2.10—19. And it will ever be found, that licentiousness is as real an enemy to liberty, as tyranny; nor is their any great difference between them.</P>
<P>Government is for every one to act toward others, in their several stations and relations, by known laws and established rules; tyranny and licentiousness are the following our own inclina∣tions without due regard to such rules. But as such a way of acting must look odious to all rati∣onal minds, when it appears in its own colours; therefore men have always tried to cover it with some specious pretence or another, which yet may be detected by such marks as these. 1. Where self prevails, it will try to excite in others so high an opinion of our deep insight into things that they do not understand, as to yield implicitly to us; while a humble teacher abhors such a dominion over others faith, and labours to ma∣nifest the truth to every man's conscience, and exhorts all saints to walk in Christ <HI>as they have been taught.</HI> 2 Cor. 1.24. and 4.2. Col. 2.7.—
<PB N="73" REF="012655_0072_0F8BBF3EA664DF68"/>18.2. Whatever garb pride is covered with, if it is crossed it will discover bitterness, and often moves its subjects to become false accusers, and fierce despisers of those who are good. Micah 3.5. 2 Tim. 3.3, 5. While the humble soul is patient, and in meekness labours to instruct those who oppose themselves. 2 Tim. 2.24, 25. Jam. 3.1, 13—18. It appears by Jotham's parable, that worthy minds, like the olive, fig-tree and vine, prefer usefulness and the yielding of sweet fruit to others, to any promotion and power over them; while worthless creatures, like the bram∣ble, are forward for dominion; and if any refuse to submit to them, they are presently for fire to come out and devour the best charac∣ters that will dare to oppose their ambition. Judges 9.7—15. Hence 3. True love unites tenderness with faithfulness, labouring to gain mens persons, while it uses boldness against their sins; but a proud temper wants to get rid of all who refuse to gratify it, and is ready to say, <HI>Am I my brother's keeper!</HI> Gen. 4. 1 John 3.12.</P>
<P>As I am willing to have all I have said and done in these affairs, tried by these marks, and no further regarded than it agrees there∣with; so I earnestly intreat all my friends and brethren, carefully to examine their conduct thereby. If we do not despise government, we have a conscientious regard to Christ's authority, and to act in our several station and relations as he has commanded us. He has commanded us to <HI>hold fast our profession,</HI> and to consider one a∣nother to provoke unto love and good works; not forsaking the assembling ourselves together, &amp;c. Heb. 10.23—25. But do not some let go
<PB N="74" REF="012655_0073_0F8BBF3ED458F430"/>their profession, instead of holding it fast; and forsake their brethren because they say they are fallen, instead of considering their weak and tempted state, and labouring to stir them up, or to restore them in a spirit of meekness, as the command is! Gal. 6.1. The same authority says, Take heed to yourselves, if thy brother trespass against thee, rebuke him; and if he re∣pent forgive him: and says, All things that are reproved are made manifest by the light. Luke 17.3. Eph. 5.13. But do not some accuse their brethren, of having fallen out of the testimony, of not coming up into the witness; of some such <HI>general</HI> phrases, without and <HI>light</HI> to <HI>manifest,</HI> wherein they have advanced any <HI>parti∣cular</HI> error, or broken any particular precept? Yea, do not some hover in general or figurative words, and tell their brethren, that they cannot see where they are, unless they come up into the witness, &amp;c.? which is a practising the very same iniquity under the pretence of spiritual teaching, as others have done under the name of great learning. Whereas our Lord said to his apostles, A candle gives light to all that are in the house; <HI>let your light shine before men, that they may see,</HI> &amp;c. Such persons are very ready to condemn the learned for keeping their people in ignorance; though some of them are as grossly guilty of <HI>darkening counsel</HI> with <HI>words without knowledge,</HI> as any sophister of the age.</P>
<P>True pastors feed God's people with know∣ledge and understanding, not with unintelligible noise. We have a glorious promise, that when scorners are consumed, who have made such use of <HI>words</HI> as to turn aside the just for a thing of
<PB N="75" REF="012655_0074_0F8BBF3F85086038"/>nought, that then, <HI>They</HI> that erred in spirit shall come to <HI>understanding,</HI> and they that murmured shall <HI>learn doctrine.</HI> Isa. 29.20—24. And it af∣fords great comfort and encouragement to my soul, to see how much this promise is now fulfil∣ling in our land; notwithstanding some are still afraid freely to exercise their understandings for fear of getting legal; and seem to think that to <HI>learn doctrine,</HI> and the distinct nature and connection of things, would lead them off from spirituality: whereas we have no more of spirituality than we have of likeness to God, in whom is <HI>no darkness at all;</HI> and the very reason why it is impossible for God to lie, or to be tempted of evil, is because he <HI>knows better.</HI> I John 1.5. James 1.13—17.</P>
<P>One important question is yet before us, which is; How shall we know when we have just cause to separate and when not? The rule is perfect, but the best of men, or of churches, are imper∣fect; and some will join with no church, because they can't find a perfect one; while others seem as if they would swallow any thing, if it did not cross their own inclination. The rule requires condescention and forbearance, but how shall we know its true limits and extent? I confess that this has been as difficult a point heretofore in my mind, as any point in practical godliness. The clearest light that I have obtained in it is this. It is essential to acting rationally that we have some design or end in what we do. Now the leading design of the gospel, is to turn men from sin to God. Act. 26.18. And so far as conforming to circumcision, and other Jewish rites, would pro∣mote this end, Paul condescended to the Jews, (and so to others) but when those things were
<PB N="76" REF="012655_0075_0F8BBF405267CAC0"/>brought up in such a way as to cross that design, he would not give place an hour longer, but ap∣peared against them with a fixed resolution. Gal. 2.5. and 5.2.</P>
<P>Another great design, is the edification of the saints; and we are all required to follow the things which make for that end. Rom. 14, 19. And every member of Christ, is required to im∣prove the gift that he has given for that end; and liberty so to do, is of importance to be main∣tained. Yet while this liberty has not been al∣lowed, (as we have seen) in the churches we came out of, some have ran to the other extreme, and have been so zealous for the liberty of speaking, as not duly to regard others liberty of judging; and instead of being <HI>subject</HI> one to another, and <HI>cloath∣ed with humility,</HI> have sadly discovered a contrary behaviour. 2 Cor 14.1 Pet. 5.5. Once more; the wisdom that is from above, is <HI>first pure,</HI> then <HI>peaceable;</HI> and so far as peace can be had consis∣tent with purity; it is to be pursued with all men: but we are never to sell the truth for peace, no not to save natural life. Jam. 3.17. Heb. 12.14. Prov. 23.23.</P>
<P>Now if our eye be single in any of these affairs to the end for which God has appointed them, he will surely guide us in judgment in our use of the means; for Christ's word is, If thine eye be sin∣gle thy whole body shall be full of light: but if evil, how great will be our darkness? Mat. 6.23. And it is very necessary that we well dis∣tinguish, between what are the divine commands, and the forbearance that is allowed in some cases towards persons who do not fully conform to them. For want of this distinction, so great a
<PB N="77" REF="012655_0076_0F8BBF411419FF00"/>man as Mr. Bunyan, improved the instance of forbearance in 2 Chron. 30.18—20, to establish the custom of communing at the Lord's table with unbaptized persons. Whereas the persons who then partook of the passover <HI>otherwise than it was written,</HI> had not enjoyed the free use of those writings for a long time; and we have no account of their ever partaking so again. What a great mistake then was it, to bring an extraor∣dinary case, to establish a general rule? Yet some have gone further still; for they have im∣proved instances of forbearance as an argument against the authority of express commands.</P>
<P>How have many improved instances of God's visiting, and using further means with degenerate churches before he cast them off; as an argument that we ought to continue with them, even after it is evident to us that they refuse to be reform∣ed? Again, Paul's foregoing his right of tem∣poral communications from some of his hearers, for particular reasons that he gives, 1 Cor. 9. some have improved as an argument that hearers are under no obligation to communicate to any on account of their teaching, but only on account of poverty; and if they are not poor, then not at all. Tho' there is not a plainer command in the bible, for ministers to preach the gospel, than there is, for <HI>him that is taught in the word,</HI> to <HI>communicate unto him that teacheth in</HI> ALL <HI>good things.</HI>" Gal. 6.6. I trust it has been sufficiently proved, that the authority of King George does not extend to this case; but shall that make us to disregard the authority of King Jesus! If he be duly re∣garded, I believe it will be found that both mi∣nisters and people, are but <HI>stewards</HI> of what they
<PB N="78" REF="012655_0077_0F8BBF41CF11D190"/>posses and therefore that avoiding all unrea∣sonable censuring of each other, their great con∣cern should be, that in their several stations and relations they may be found <HI>faithful,</HI> so as at last to receive <HI>praise of God.</HI> 1 Cor. 4.1—5.</P>

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO Mr. <HI>Joseph Fish.</HI></HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>SINCE you accuse me with, <Q>setting up my∣self as <HI>Censor general</HI> of the present genera∣tion, and with sending abroad a book, full of invectives, bitterness, clamour and evil-speaking against Christ's ministers.</Q> p. 124, 126. I know of no better method to answer it, than by a little imitation of the apostles example in like cases. Acts. 11.4—17. and 21.1—21. Namely to give a plain narrative of what I have done, and the reasons of my doing so.</P>
<P>As to setting up myself, I freely appeal to all that knew me, that from my cradle to my en∣trance on preaching, I discovered a disposition, the reverse of setting up myself, as head or leader of any company whatsoever. And my consci∣ence bears me witness in the sight of God, that
<PB N="80" REF="012655_0079_0F8BBF43A72020E8"/>the only reason of my engaging in that work, was because I was so clearly convinced, that He had given me a <HI>gift,</HI> which He called me to improve in that way, that I durst not neglect obedience to Him therein; for I believed then, and do to this day, that there was a <HI>wo unto me if I preached not the gospel:</HI> therefore I heartily devoted myself to that work, and was freely received therein by God's people; in which I went on for a number of years, before I had any thoughts of appearing to the world in print. But being called to preach in various places, that old question was often put, by those called standing ministers, <HI>by what autho∣rity dost thou these things?</HI> and the darkness which they discovered about it, at last moved me to attempt to hold up to the world, the light that was given me therein, which was accordingly done in 1754, under the title of, <Q>The nature and necessity of an internal call to preach the gospel.</Q> And your learned brethren were so far from attempting ro confute it, that some of them expressed such charity as this; that <Q><HI>I. B.</HI> never wrote that book, but got his name set to the works of some other man; for (said they) scarce one to ten of our college-learnt men could write such a discourse.</Q> Whereas it is known to Him who will judge us all, that no person on earth, either wrote or indited one line of it, but he whose name stands in the title page.</P>
<P>As to baptism, after long and sore exercises of mind, occasioned as I see now, chiefly by the false representations which tradition had handed down to us, both concerning principles and facts, I was at last favored with a comfortable establish∣ment. After which I was publicly declared, to
<PB N="81" REF="012655_0080_0F8BBF443459DEE8"/>be a <HI>covenant-breaker,</HI> for turning from infant baptism, notwithstanding our covenant, like that of the fathers of this country, expressed an en∣gagement, to embrace further light as God should open it to us. When this censure came abroad, in the result of a council of elders and brethren, who had professed and acted in fellowship with baptist churches, it naturally caused a general difficulty; and which at length occasioned a ge∣neral meeting of the separate and baptist churches in your town, in May, 1754; where I remember sir, that you was among the spectators; when, instead of attending to the point in hand, which was, whether a declaring, that turning from in∣fant baptism was covenant breaking, did not give just occasion of offence to the baptists? I say instead of that, much time was taken up in exposing my imperfections about these affairs; which had the same effect with many, that such-like treatment of the baptists has often had, ever since the first reformations from popery; viz. to prevent their seeing things in their true light. But tho' my character was thus injuriously treated, se∣venty miles from home, before an assembly, from at least three of the four governments of New-England, yet I chose as much as possible, to avoid all personal contests, and only published, as clearly as I was enabled, the true state of the argument concerning baptism, in a discourse up∣on the <HI>bond-woman</HI> and the <HI>free.</HI></P>
<P>And I never engaged in a printed controversy with any particular person, for seventeen years after my call to the public ministry; till in 1764, the gentleman under whose ministry I was born, and from whom I separated, with six others, pub∣lished
<PB N="82" REF="012655_0081_0F8BBF48A4CC9010"/>a piece, wherein, after mentioning the order to blow the <HI>trumpet,</HI> and to sound an <HI>alarm</HI> in Zion, they went on to alarm the world, with a representation that the <HI>late separates</HI> and <HI>baptists,</HI> were <HI>going fast</HI> into a <HI>dreadful apostacy;</HI> and that it was, <Q>hid from them, or rather, that they <HI>will not see,</HI> that they have fell into the way of <HI>Cain,</HI> and are in danger of <HI>perishing</HI> in the <HI>gain∣saying</HI> of <HI>Core.</HI></Q> Upon a sight of this, and other things of like nature, from my old minister, I sent a printed <HI>letter</HI> to him, upon the injustice of such conduct. And what is there in all this, of setting up myself? Tho' I know I am a very imperfect creature, yet I can freely submit, both the occasion, and the temper of these writings, to the judgment of every christian reader.</P>
<P>When you sir, three years after, published a large piece, in the same strain with the ministers just mentioned, and I was prevail'd with to exa∣mine it, I thought something further was called for, than what I had before done. And as there is a rule in some cases, to <HI>rebuke sharply,</HI> and to use a <HI>rod,</HI> which is distinguishable from a <HI>spirit of meekness.</HI> 1 Cor. 4.21. I thought it right to make a little trial of the <HI>rods,</HI> which you and others have furnished us with, to see if ministers had not some feeling, as well as the people that they have been threshing these twenty years. The temper and manner of my executing this design, is further to be considered. You tell me that if I had reproved you with <HI>meekness</HI> of spirit, had a temper good and kind, you should <HI>doubtless</HI> have understood my inoffensive language, and <HI>given a serious attention</HI> to it. p. 124. Could I have believed that, I assure you I would have
<PB N="83" REF="012655_0082_0F8BBF4AF667B818"/>taken that method; for tho' a little salt and vinegar may give food a good relish, even with healthy persons; yet I think it was a very just observa∣tion of a noted author, in his <HI>estimate</HI> of the manners and principles of the times, that people's being much more taken with things that <HI>tickle</HI> and <HI>irritate,</HI> than with those which are <HI>solid</HI> and <HI>nourishing,</HI> clearly proves the <HI>distempered taste</HI> of our age.</P>
<P>I wish you had now given me reason to think, that you was disposed to give due <HI>attention</HI> to mild and fair reasoning, upon the affairs between us; for that is my choice: and since we seem to agree in two general heads, I think to make a little trial of what can be done under them.</P>
<P>Frist I observed, that let us talk what we may, of defending <HI>truth</HI> and of promoting its cause, if at the same time we advance <HI>false arguments,</HI> or discover a wrong <HI>temper</HI> and behaviour, we there∣by contract guilt to ourselves, and injure our fel∣low-men. This observation you concur with, p. 125. And let us see what can be done under it.</P>
<P>And,</P>
<P N="1">1. Those who <HI>Commend themselves,</HI> and <HI>measure themselves by themselves,</HI> instead of the eternal standard of truth, use false arguments 2 Cor. 10.12. Now sir, in order to convince me of my faults you say, <Q>You saw me every where friend∣ly to the work of God; and while I exposed &amp; reproved the false principles, spirit and prac∣tice of my erring brethren, you heard me fre∣quently and <HI>sufficiently</HI> express my charity, love and <HI>tenderness</HI> for their <HI>persons</HI></Q> p. 126. This is what you say; now for the proof of it.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="012655_0083_0F8BBF4C055BC3E0"/>
You sir, in your sermons, began your argu∣ments, against the separates with allowing, that they held a number of <HI>truths,</HI> and had some <HI>orders</HI> among them that were good, but say, <Q>I know not of one principle or practice, among <HI>them,</HI> that is agreable to the gospel, but what they learned in OUR churches.—But THEY have done much to weaken and pull down <HI>the church of God,</HI> rather than to build it up.</Q> p. 113. Of learning you say, <Q>Though <HI>all</HI> OUR teachers have not an equal degree of learning; yet HERE the treasure lies, in THESE churches of Christ."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Now Sir, is learning limited to the churches of your own town! p. 12.</NOTE> p. 168. "The body of the separates are <HI>truce-breakers,</HI> for—<HI>they</HI> openly renounced communion with US, when WE the standing churches were daily attending the ordinances of Christ, agreable to his institution.</Q> p. 17. But you say, <Q>Such is the conduct of our sepa∣rate brethren, in this grand affair, of casting off a <HI>learned, able minister,</HI> and setting up such as are <HI>unlearned</HI> in their room; 'tis really affect∣ing (and I speak it with concern) to see how they are beguiled and led astray, by the subtil∣ty of <HI>satan</HI> in this <HI>interesting</HI> affair; and how manifestly they <HI>join with</HI> the <HI>gates of hell,</HI> a∣gainst THE church of Christ.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Note Sir, you forgot this passage when you complained of my title. p. 16, 17.</NOTE>—Satan de∣ceives them.</Q> p. 177. Yea, as as if you had had been inspired to tell men's hearts, you say of these brethren <Q><HI>They</HI> held fast <HI>their deceit,</HI> they <HI>refused</HI> to return.</Q> p. 128. <Q>Surely we have
<PB N="85" REF="012655_0084_0F8BBF4C4CC8EB30"/>as full evidence, as the nature of the case can admit of, that it was a <HI>false spirit,</HI> and a false religion that made the separation a∣mong us, a device of satan, that old serpent the devil, to injure THE church of God.</Q> p. 161. <Q>The <HI>lusts</HI> of spiritual-pride, self-love, vain-confidence or self-sufficiency; these <HI>lusts</HI> do evidently appear <HI>in</HI> and run <HI>through</HI> the WHOLE affair of separation (though <HI>all</HI> are not equally guilty).</Q> p. 164. And to describe what a <HI>sweet</HI> and <HI>calm</HI> temper you went with, to the first separate ordination in your town, you name the two worst enemies the christian has in earth or hell, and then add the separates as the third; saying, <Q>The great Searcher of hearts, knows the severe conflict that I had with SA∣TAN, SELF and the SEPARATES (for several hours before the engagement) and the sensible victory that he gave me over <HI>them all.</HI></Q> p. 156.</P>
<P>Now sir, when through your sermons I saw you thus labouring to confine the work of God to your own party, and heard you in strong terms, not only declare your brethren to be governed by their <HI>lusts</HI> and <HI>deluded</HI> by the <HI>devil,</HI> but also to rank them with the worst of <HI>your</HI> enemies; how was it possible for me to see <HI>you friendly</HI> to God's work, or <HI>tender</HI> to his people, while you was so doing!</P>
<P>This reminds me of another instance of your late <HI>tenderness.</HI> From your attempts in your ser∣mons to draw our picture in odious colors, I took occasion to observe, that Ward's daughter being taken from her husband, and John Smith's wife being poisoned, had often been cast upon us from
<PB N="86" REF="012655_0085_0F8BBF4D1438F0E0"/>pulpits for the same end; although the former never was received as a member of any of our churches, and the latter was excommunicated for his corrupt principles before he committed that fact. You now tell your readers, that I have omitted some material and <HI>interesting</HI> circumstan∣ces relating to Smith, and the church at Canter∣bury, which keep the <HI>bad tendency</HI> of their sepa∣rating principles out of sight; which therefore you have published; tho' you say, <Q>It grieves me to relate these things, for I feel <HI>tender</HI> for the cause and people of God.</Q> p. 112, 113. These <HI>interesting</HI> circumstances are, That he had been a very vicious man, but was looked upon by that church a remarkable instance of conver∣sion; and that after his excommunication, and the great crimes he committed. <Q>Yet so tena∣ciously did they hold to their darling principle of a <HI>certain knowledge of christians,</HI> that they retained their opinion of him as a christian still: and many of them brought the instance of the fall of David, Peter, &amp;c. to justify their sentiments.</Q> You have not been so fair as to tell us which members they were that talked so, nor from whom you had your information. I know that their pastor and some others talked otherwise to me; and their conduct evidenced to the world, that they were earnest to have jus∣tice done him for his sin, both in church and state. But suppose that every word you have related was truth; I could produce an instance of one of your fathers in the ministry, who publicly declared his opinion that one of his members was gone to heaven, that put an end to her own life; how then is the bad <HI>tendency</HI> of our separation disco∣vered
<PB N="87" REF="012655_0086_0F8BBF4DC4564290"/>by what you have related? Rather, does not the <HI>interesting</HI> matter lie here; that you are con∣scious that your brethren if not yourself, have from your pulpits reproached the separate chur∣ches with these two instances of scandal, one of which never was among them, and the other they had cleared themselves of in a gospel manner; and so it should appear that you have been guilty, as Dr. <HI>Franck</HI> says, <Q>In your sermons of wholly <HI>perverting</HI> God's ordinance, by rejecting and calumniating those who desire to govern their lives by the gospel of Christ.</Q> Ex. p. 84.</P>
<P N="2">2. Should you sir, hear an enthusiast, (as I once did) bring this as an argument to prove himself right, in receiving one to administer bap∣tism, who he said, he feared was <HI>corrupt</HI> in prin∣ciple, and knew he was in practice, viz. That this text came suddenly to his mind, <HI>Go with him nothing doubting, for I have sent him:</HI> would you not at once declare this to be a false argument? Well, in a book published by one Mr. <HI>I.F.</HI> who stiles himself a <HI>master</HI> of <HI>arts,</HI> when he is arguing for ministers having <HI>human learning,</HI> he in his 175th page sets down exactly these words; <Q>Our Lord hath shown us that LEARNING is emi∣nently useful, yea even necessary. Isa. 50 4. <HI>The Lord God hath given me the tongue of the learned that I should know how to speak a word in season, to him that is weary.</HI> Intimating that he should not have <HI>known how,</HI> without a learned tongue.</Q> Now there was one <HI>I.B.</HI> that had no A.M. to put to the end of his name, who yet ventured to publish an <HI>examination</HI> of this book, and when he came to this passage, he was so bold as to say, in his 44th page, <Q>If Mr.
<PB N="88" REF="012655_0087_0F8BBF4E84E641D8"/><HI>F.</HI> knows no better, than to construe this scrip∣ture so, where is his learning? and if he does, where is his <HI>honesty?</HI> his controversy with us is about <HI>human</HI> learning, whereas that text expresseth <HI>divine</HI> learning, as plain as words can possibly do; and there is great reason to think that the prophet here personates HIM, who tho' he were a Son, yet <HI>learned be obodience by the things which he suffered,</HI> and being <HI>tempt∣ed,</HI> he was <HI>able to succour them that are tempt∣ed.</HI></Q></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has taken him smartly to task for thus meddling with him, in a piece called, The <HI>ex∣aminer examined:</HI> and on this particular, tho' he owns that the controversy was about <HI>human learn∣ing,</HI> and that he took the prophet in that text, to be speaking of the <HI>man Christ Jesus;</HI> yet he says, <Q>The <HI>manner</HI> of his receiving this <HI>learning</HI> or knowledge, does not alter the <HI>nature</HI> of it; 'tis <HI>human learning</HI> still: and Christ <HI>as man,</HI> had all that is contained therein.</Q> And he takes up half a page to shew to us, that Christ was eminently furnished with <HI>grammar, logic</HI> and <HI>rhetoric;</HI> <Q>in all which (says he) the excellency of <HI>human</HI> learning consists.</Q> then he says, <Q>Tho' I know not what Mr. <HI>B.</HI> intends, parti∣cularly by <HI>divine</HI> learning (for his ideas are very singular)—yet, I freely concur, that the phrase also imports an <HI>ability</HI> of speaking in all points, as becometh a person TAUGHT OF GOD, and filled with all <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>heavenly wisdom</HI> and <HI>knowledge,</HI> and a singular <HI>skill</HI> of <HI>winning souls,</HI> and working upon men's HEARTS and CONSCIENCES. These things I own are included or suggested to us, by the prophet
<PB N="89" REF="012655_0088_0F8BBF4F45674D00"/>in this scripture, though more remotely: the FIRST and <HI>most obvious</HI> import of the word, is in favor of <HI>human</HI> learning; which is AS MUCH the GIFT of GOD, in its place, as GRACE to improve it to the <HI>glory</HI> of the giver. And it's highly worthy of our respectful notice, in this day of reproach and contempt cast upon this <HI>gift</HI> of the SPIRIT, even <HI>learning,</HI> that our Lord in speaking of ministerial accomplish∣ments, which he had an infinite fulness of, should use such a striking <HI>phrase</HI> as this, <HI>The tongue of the learned.</HI></Q> p. 85—87.</P>
<P>It appears plain, that this writer had some thoughts about him; for he submits his <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>honesty,</HI> in all this, only to "the <HI>learned</HI> or judicious reader," and tells us, If <HI>modesty</HI> be add∣ed, he <HI>thinks</HI> it would lead Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to enquire whether he did not, <HI>exercise himself in things too high for him!</HI> I say, it appears plain that he had some thoughts about him: for 'tis a wonder if some people who are not masters of arts, do not prove themselves to be so destitute of <HI>modesty,</HI> and so "singular in their ideas," as to judge, that this minister had not lately read that old question, <HI>How knoweth this man letters, having never</HI> LEARNED? nor the <HI>tender</HI> and <HI>charitable</HI> sentence of the <HI>learned</HI> ministers of that day, who said, <Q>Are ye also <HI>deceived!</HI> have <HI>any</HI> of the <HI>rulers,</HI> or of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> believed on him! but THIS PEOPLE who KNOWETH NOT <HI>the</HI> LAW, <HI>are</HI> CURSED!</Q> John 7.15, 47—49. Yea, tis much if <HI>this people</HI> do not some of them presume so far upon <HI>logic,</HI> as to conclude, that it was this minister's <HI>spiritual</HI> gift of <HI>human</HI> learning,
<PB N="90" REF="012655_0089_0F8BBF503AC32EB0"/>that taught him to <HI>know how,</HI> in a letter of CHRISTIAN reproof,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In your proposals for subscription, this part of the book in called, <Q>A letter of <HI>christian</HI> reproof for the <HI>bitter anti∣christian</HI> spirit that run through the whole of his per∣formance.</Q></NOTE> to introduce the HEATHEN <HI>fable,</HI> of <HI>Pheaton</HI>'s setting the world on fire; and (whatsoever <HI>Jupiter</HI> may do with his thunder bolts, yet as to men) <HI>how in season</HI> to say <Q>WE have not LEARNED—<HI>railing for railing.</HI>—I hope the <HI>church</HI> is not in any <HI>great</HI> danger. —As for <HI>yourself,</HI> I believe you may rest se∣cure.

You are also defended, and may likely escape, by the <HI>illsavour</HI> of your writings; on account of which <HI>property,</HI> you are aptly compared by Mr. Flavel, to some cunning animals, which when pursued at the heels, drive away both dogs and huntsmen, with their <HI>intolerable stench,</HI></Q> p. 124, 125.</P>

But truly Sir, if I am rude in speech, I mean not to be so in knowledge; and I can freely refer it to all christian people among us, let them be learned or unlearned, whether your argument for the necessity of <HI>human</HI> learning, from that striking phrase, is not as false as his was, who took the striking phrase, <HI>Go with him;</HI> without due regard to the character of the persons we should go with? For my part I confess, that for you to call it a <HI>singular idea,</HI> to speak of <HI>divine</HI> learning, as distinct from all that man can teach, when yet in the next breath you are forced thus to distinguish, and call the former, a being <HI>Taught of God,</HI> and filled with the <HI>divine skill</HI> of <HI>winning souls,</HI> and working upon men's <HI>hearts</HI> and <HI>consciences;</HI> and then to hear you declare that this <HI>divine skill,</HI> is more <HI>remotely</HI> included in Isa. 50.4. than the <HI>human</HI> learning of grammar, logic and rhetoric, which you assert, is <HI>as much</HI> the gift of God as <HI>grace;</HI> and that you do not <HI>freely</HI> submit your <HI>learning</HI> and <HI>honesty</HI> in these matters to any but the <HI>learned;</HI> I own that all these things are too wonderful for me, unless I suppose, that as those who formerly made <HI>heart</HI> religion a <HI>remote</HI> thing, and sought deep to <HI>hide</HI> their <HI>council,</HI> in righteous judgment, <HI>wisdom</HI> was <HI>hid</HI> from them, Isa. 29.13—15; so that something of like na∣ture has taken place again: For when ministers stand as they ought, they renounce such <HI>hidden things,</HI> and by <HI>manifestation</HI> of the TRUTH, com∣mended themselves, not only to the learned, but to <HI>every man</HI>'s CONSCIENCE <HI>in the sight of God.</HI> 2 Cor. 4.2.</P>
<P N="3">3. For a disputant to take any truth which his opponent holds as much as he does, and blend it
<PB N="92" REF="012655_0091_0F8BBF55C37A3E58"/>with that which is not true, in order to gain his argument, this you say is <Q>false and sophistical reasoning.</Q> p. 99. A proof by the way, that your temper can bear with hard names, when you think them applicable to your opponent. Whe∣ther these be so here or not, is to be consider∣ed. The case is thus. In trying to prove that the separates <HI>heaped</HI> to themselves teachers, you said, <Q>According to one grand principle of their churches, <HI>every one</HI> must exercise his gifts in <HI>public</HI> as he is impressed or moved by the spirit.</Q> In answer I observed, that for you to pretend that we hold <HI>all</HI> to have the gift for <HI>public</HI> teachers is not true. Ex. p. 80.</P>
<P>You now charge me with starting from the question, and say, <Q>'tis evident that in the fault∣ed passage above, I have <HI>limited</HI> the charge of speaking in <HI>public,</HI> to them that have <HI>gifts,</HI> and that are <HI>impressed</HI> or <HI>moved</HI> by the Spirit to exercise them. And from hence Mr. <HI>B.</HI> infers, that I therein charge the separates with holding that ALL have the gift for public teachers.</Q> This you call <HI>false</HI> and <HI>sophistical</HI> reasoning. p. 98, 99. To which I shall only <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hat your words were, <HI>Every one;</HI> and you <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> that argument with naming <Q>women, old and young, together with <HI>unskilful</HI> and self-concerted exhorters,</Q> which you represent that the separates wer<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>obliged,</HI> by the <HI>canons</HI> of their church, to suffer to <Q>Teach and <HI>preach</HI> among them</Q> Ser. p. 163, 165. And if every one does not mean <HI>all,</HI> and if <HI>unskilful</HI> persons moved with <HI>self conceit,</HI> means the same as <HI>gifted</HI> ones <HI>moved</HI> by <HI>the spirit,</HI> then I have reasoned sophi∣stically; if not I believe the epithet will fall back
<PB N="93" REF="012655_0092_0F8BBF5811E8EE30"/>upon him who began the argument. That I freely leave to others, and only remark, that this was the first time of my hearing of <HI>canons</HI> in our churches, except the canon of scripture.</P>
<P>Now to come to what is mainly here aimed at, I would note, that the general plan of your ser∣mons, was to give the characters of Christ's church, and then to apply the same to the churches of our day. In doing of which you endevoured to prove, that those you call <HI>standing churches,</HI> are upon the Rock, and so near like the first church in Plymouth, as to claim a <HI>right</HI> of relation as <HI>sisters</HI> or <HI>children</HI> thereto. And though you was forced to own that they, and the authors of Cam∣bridge platform, professed that the power of ordi∣nation is in the church, yet you tried to prove that they did not act according to that profes∣sion. This I proved so plainly to be a mistake, that you have not attempted to refute me in it; though you now say <Q>the <HI>practice</HI> of the churches is generally if not universally as I have said it ought to be.</Q> But lest the reader by this should see a real difference between you and our fathers, you slip in a clause from Cambridge platform, concerning the churches improving <HI>el∣ders</HI> in ordinations where they can conveniently be obtained. p. 46. This point I twice over de∣clared, that we ALL hold to, and practice upon. Ex. p. 17.63. To what end then, can it be here mentioned but to hide the truth?</P>
<P>In the scond place I clearly proved, that our fathers way of admitting members, was by a <HI>ver∣bal relation to the church,</HI> of <HI>a work of God's Spirit on their hearts;</HI> which has since degenerated into <HI>written</HI> relations, and from that to <HI>none at all,</HI> in
<PB N="94" REF="012655_0093_0F8BBF5930E0B5E8"/>many places. This you cannot deny, but try to evade it by saying, you was not treating of a <HI>particular</HI> church; and then you slip in a clause, that in case of <HI>excessive fear,</HI> our fathers varied from their common method. p. 51. And who ever denied that?</P>
<P>This led me down to open a third article of difference between you and our fathers, which is the root of all, namely the <HI>matter</HI> of the gospel church. And I produce full testimonies from such as you allow to be some of your most emi∣nent fathers. <Q>That if it should pass for cur∣rent doctrine in New-England, that all per∣sons <HI>orthodox</HI> in judgment, as to matters of faith, not <HI>scandalous</HI> in life, ought to be admit∣ted to partake of the Lord's supper, without an examination concerning the <HI>work of saving grace in their hearts,</HI> it would be a real <HI>apos∣tacy</HI> from former principles.</Q> Then I pro∣duced the <HI>letter</HI> published against us by sixteen ministers (and you now call it an excellent <HI>letter.</HI> p. 54.) which says, <Q>It is the will of Christ, that all those who make an <HI>outward credible profession of christianity,</HI> should be admitted in∣to his church, and though <HI>unconverted</HI> BE THERE.</Q> Ex. p. 18.20.</P>
<P>Thus I proved, that our fathers held the power of ordination to be in the church; but that you hold it to be in ministers. That they held to admitting members by verbal relations; you to written ones, or none at all: And thirdly that our fathers declared, That a <HI>general profession</HI> would be real <HI>apostacy;</HI> and I proved that your chur∣ches have got into it: yet you shuffle along, till from our fathers writing, you bring out the
<PB N="95" REF="012655_0094_0F8BBF59D0FB55F8"/>materials of the church to be <HI>professing believers,</HI> and <HI>their children,</HI> and then say, <Q>Surely here is <HI>distinction</HI> without difference—And yet he is shewing an <HI>essential</HI> difference between the standing churches, and the first in the land. ALL the difference is they EXACTLY agree.</Q> p. 52.</P>
<P>Whether this is most properly called <HI>sophistry,</HI> or <HI>lying,</HI> I leave with God and your own conscience, praying that you may be brought to true repen∣tance.</P>
<P>Having as I concieved, fully proved and essen∣tial difference between your churches and our fathers, and meeting with that glaring perversion of the parable of the tares, viz. applying what Christ spoke of the <HI>world,</HI> to the <HI>church;</HI> I took occasion to point out the nature of his order, <HI>Let both grow together;</HI> and how it has been violated among us, by depriving those of their <HI>worldly</HI> liberties and enjoyments, who would not conform to the parish ministers. Upon which I gave it as my mind that there may and ought to be, a <HI>sweet harmony</HI> between civil and ecclesiasti∣cal rulers, but not <HI>such a union</HI> as had been a∣mong us; for which I gave my reasons, and en∣devoured distinctly to run the line between them, Ex. p. 20—32. yet you assert this part of my book to be <Q>mixed, inconnected and without order,</Q> and that I have got <HI>beside</HI> my <HI>professed</HI> design, and also that I fault your churches for <HI>a connection</HI> with the state, which you say, <Q>is evi∣dently warranted by the holy scriptures.</Q> p. 55. 56. But take notice; the first part of my professed design was, to <HI>open the constitution</HI> of your churches. Ex. p. 15. and in this place I
<PB N="96" REF="012655_0095_0F8BBF5A9130A280"/>was not beside it, but upon it, and proved the <HI>constitution</HI> to be such, that if the parish minister disliked another's preaching near him, or called for his salary, the secular powers must exert their <HI>force</HI> to remove those he was offended with; and to answer his demands: And if you Sir, thought <HI>such a connection</HI> to be warranted by scrip∣ture, your business evidently was to bring your proofs. And have you done it? No.—Indeed you have proved that there was <HI>a union</HI> between the church and state in Israel, (which I held as much as you) but not a word of <HI>such a connection</HI> as I had faulted. p. 56. 57. Then you shew that Isa. 49.23, and 1 Tim. 2.1, 2. imply <Q>Not only that the magistrate should not himself lay hands on us, nor send his officers and servants to spoil us of, or interrupt us <HI>in,</HI> the enjoyment of our religious rights; but also that as he has it in his power, he would restrain and punish those that should molest or trouble us in mat∣ters of <HI>godliness</HI> or <HI>religion,</HI> as well as in matters of <HI>honesty,</HI> which we have a right to, in com∣mon with other men.</Q> p. 58.</P>
<P>And where is sophistry now! dare you Mr. <HI>Fish,</HI> before him whose eyes are like a flame of fire, pretend that I have wrote a word, or formed the least argument against <HI>such</HI> an exercise of the magistrates power towards the church as you have described! No: if those powers had not been moved by <HI>your</HI> brethren in the <HI>ministry</HI> to act the very contrary part, to what you have proved from the word of God that they ought to have acted, I assure you I would not have troubled you in this affair. I observe that instead of a∣greeing with me that the <HI>worst mistake</HI> that our
<PB N="97" REF="012655_0096_0F8BBF5B4A5EFBC8"/>fathers brought to this land, was their confound∣ing church and state together, you reckon one of their worst mistakes was, allowing the church the power of ordination; on which you say, <Q>Jesus Christ is head and king; and none may right∣fully dare to set up any practice, or establish any order in his house, but what he has direct∣ed to: to be sure none contrary to his direction. The holy scriptures, not the platform, are to guide us in this important question.</Q> p. 47. Yet in the important question, whether magis∣trates have any warrant to use force to support ministers or not? here <HI>the case is altered.</HI> Mr. <HI>F.</HI> has sound no warrant for that in the scrip∣tures, therefore he flies to the platform, and tells of the <HI>rules</HI> our <HI>pious fathers</HI> laid down therein, which he says, <Q>Is done with so much <HI>caution,</HI> judgment and <HI>excellency of spirit,</HI> that, tis pity Mr. <HI>B.</HI> had not contented himself with the rules <HI>there.</HI></Q> p. 59. And what are these rules? why one of them contains these words. <Q>If any church shall rend itself from the com∣munion of other churches;—in such case the magistrate is to put forth his <HI>coercive power.</HI></Q> Another of them is; <Q>The magistrate is to see that the <HI>ministry</HI> be duly provided for</Q> which you explain as meaning that he shall <Q><HI>oblige</HI> the people that won't do their duty without.</Q> p. 63.</P>
<P>Now Sir, come up like an honest man. These rules were first drawn by ministers, and thou art the minister who hast blamed me for not being <HI>contented</HI> with them, declaring them to be laid down with <HI>caution</HI> and <HI>excellency of spirit;</HI> and I can freely appeal to your conscience, that it
<PB N="98" REF="012655_0097_0F8BBF5C0D07E830"/>was really according to the <HI>spirit</HI> of these rules that the magistrate acted, when to prevent our first separate ordination at Mansfield, they sent their servants, when the old gentlemen that was elected for their pastor, was at worship with his church the day before he was to have been or∣dained, and LAID HANDS on him, and carried him to prison, for preaching without the li∣cence of such <HI>ministers</HI> as thou art. This my eyes saw; and the next day I saw more than a dozen of such ministers come up after the <HI>shepherd</HI> was thus <HI>smitten,</HI> to see if they could not <HI>scatter that flock,</HI> which, as your rules express it, had <HI>rent itself</HI> from your communion. Ex. p. 47.</P>
<P>So openly were those doings of the civil powers (which you have proved was the reverse of what they ought to have acted) countenanced by mi∣nisters, who were most if not all of them, signers of that which you now call an <HI>excellent letter;</HI> and so openly did they say in practice, that if these people would withdraw from their <HI>churches,</HI> they should not peaceably <HI>grow together with them in the world.</HI> Yet Mr. <HI>F.</HI> thou art the man, who hast declared to the world, that <Q>It is wholly out of rule, and quite injurious, for Mr. <HI>B.</HI> to charge the <HI>churches</HI> or their <HI>ministers</HI> with sending men to jail for rates, or other <HI>like pro∣secutions</HI> (as he rudely talks, and unreasonably complains, throughout his book) for <HI>these</HI> pro∣ceedings are evidently the acts of the civil state, done for its OWN utility.</Q> p. 56. <Q>The doings of the civil authority, and of that ALONE.</Q> p. 59.</P>
<P>I hope our honorable rulers will take warning by this, and never more exert their power till
<PB N="99" REF="012655_0098_0F8BBF5D250D9C68"/>they know who it is for; and never use any more <HI>force</HI> to support ministers, till ministers can pro∣duce divine rule for it, and also will own that it is <HI>for them.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">"It is not the diversity of opinions (which cannot be avoided) but the refusal of toleration to those of different opinions (which might be granted) that has produced all the bustles and wars that have been in the christian world, upon account of religion.

I come,</P>
<P N="4">4. To observe, that all arguments which are founded upon a violation of the <HI>golden rule</HI> are certainly false ones. That your arguments against us were so founded. I before attempted to prove by three witnesses, out of your ser∣mons; the first of which I introduced thus: No man or community can think it reasonable, to have their <HI>character</HI> drawn only from their <HI>imper∣fections</HI> without any of their <HI>virtues:</HI> yet shewed
<PB N="100" REF="012655_0099_0F8BBE90C7D47888"/>that you had done so with the separates. Ex. p. 5. In reply to which, you now say, <Q>It was not my proper business to draw their character as <HI>men</HI> nor as <HI>christians,</HI> but only as <HI>separates,</HI> (sermon, p. 160.)—Whatever virtues they had as men or as christians (which I frequently allow them) yet I knew of none they had <HI>as separates.</HI> Therefore I had properly to do with nothing but their <HI>imperfections,</HI> errors or faults.</Q> p. 19.</P>
<P>Here Mr. <HI>F.</HI> permit me to tell you one thing, and that is; as much as you think I am prejudi∣ced against your order of ministers, yet I would not have ventured to believe, much less pub∣lickly to declare, that you knowingly held to so gross things as you now express, both concern∣ing a learned tongue, and the golden rule, not upon the verbal testimony of the best friend I have on earth. No, I should have thought they some way mistook your meaning: but what is written is written. And though some peculiar circumstances that I have passed through, have (through divine goodness) taught me more how self can blind us, than perhaps many others know; yet your book has taught me more of it than I ever saw before, and in that respect has done me good; and I should be glad to do you a like kindness, though not in a like manner.</P>
<P>Dear Sir, according to your own account, you know of many virtues that these people had as <HI>men</HI> and as <HI>christians,</HI> but say, <Q>I knew of <HI>none</HI> they had as <HI>separates.</HI></Q> That is, as they stood opposite to <HI>yourselves,</HI> neither <HI>manhood</HI> nor <HI>chris∣tianity</HI> must go into their <HI>character.</HI> What a
<PB N="101" REF="012655_0100_0F8BBE918459E440"/>thing is SELF! I attempted to favour you with a glass to see him in before; but as it was from a <HI>bishop,</HI> you pass it by as not to the purpose. p. 22. I am now favoured with another that is so much clearer, and from such as you own to be worthy hands, that I can't but hope for better suc∣cess than the other met with. It is this. Three years after our fathers published those rules in the Cambridge platform, which you say 'tis pity I had not been contented with, Mr. John Clark, pastor of the baptist church in Newport (and who was learned both in Greek and Hebrew) went with two of his friends to visit some breth∣ren in Lynn; but as they were peaceably wor∣shipping God together, on Lord's day, July 20, 1651, a magistrate was so zealous to follow the ministers rules, that he put forth his <HI>coercive power,</HI> and had those three men seized before they had finished their forenoon exercise, and car∣ried in the afternoon to the parish worship; and afterwards sent them prisoners to Boston. There they were all fined, and for not paying it, one of them was whipped thirty lashes, and two of his friends, for openly taking him by the hand, and praising God for his courage and constancy in suffering, were carried before the general court in Boston, and fined 40<ABBR>s.</ABBR> each, or to be whipped.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Neal's history of New-England, vol.

<P>When news of this reached to London, Sir Richard Saltonstall, one of the Massachusetts first: magistrates, wrote to the ministers of Boston in this manner.</P>
<Q><P>Reverend and dear friends, whom I un∣feignedly love and respect.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="012655_0101_0F8BBE93EC7689B0"/>
It doth not a little grieve my spirit to hear what sad things are reported daily of your tyran∣ny and persecutions in New-England.—Truly friends, this your practice of <HI>compelling</HI> any in matters to worship, to that whereof they are not <HI>fully persuaded,</HI> is to make them <HI>sin,</HI> for so the apostle (Rom. 14.23.) tells us, and many are made hypocrites thereby, conforming in their outward man for fear of punishment. We pray for you, and wish you prosperity e∣very way, hoped the Lord would have given you so much light and love there, that you might have been eyes to God's people here, and not to practise those courses in a wilder∣ness, which you went so far to prevent.— These rigid ways have laid you very low in the hearts of the saints. I do asure you I have heard them pray in the public assemblies, that the Lord would give you meek and humble spirits, not to strive so much for <HI>unifor∣mity,</HI> as to keep the <HI>unity of the spirit in the bond of peace.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Massachusetts history, vol.

<P>To this Mr. Cotton wrote an answer, wherein are these words, <Q><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Ibid p. 403—407.</NOTE> Honored and dear Sir, My brother Wilson and self do both of us ac∣knowledge your love, as otherwise formerly, so now in the late lines we received from you, that you grieve in spirit to hear daily com∣plaints against us.—Be pleased to understand we look at such complaints as <HI>altogether</HI> in∣jurious in respect of <HI>ourselves,</HI> who had no hand or tongue at all to promote, either the
<PB N="103" REF="012655_0102_0F8BBE951D2AC430"/>comnig of the persons you aim at into our as∣semblies, or their punishment for their carri∣age there. Righteous judgment will not take up reports, much less reproaches against the innocent. The cry of the sinners of Sodom was great and loud, and reached up to heaven; yet the righteous God (giving us an example what to do in the like case) he would first go down to see whether their crime were altogether according to the cry, before he would proceed to judgment, Gen. 18.20, 21. and when he did find the truth of the cry, he did not wrap up all alike promiscuously in the judgment, but saved such as he found innocent. We are a∣mongst those whom (if you know us better) you would account peaceable in Israel.—Yet nei∣ther are we so vast in our indulgence or tolera∣tion as to think the men you speak of suffered an unjust censure. For one of them (Obadiah Holmes being an excommunicate person him∣self, out of a church in Plymouth patent,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">He was excommunicated for separating from the church in Rehoboth.</NOTE> came into this jurisdiction, and took upon him to baptize, which I think himself will not say he was compelled here to perform—The inpri∣sonment of either of them was no detriment. I believe they fared neither of them better at home.—But be pleased to consider this point a little further. If the worship be law∣ful the magistrate compelling him to come to it, compelleth him not to sin, but the sin is in his <HI>will</HI> that needs to be compelled to a christian duty.—Better to be hypocrites than profane
<PB N="104" REF="012655_0103_0F8BBE954D530E78"/>persons; hypocrites give God part of his due, the outward man; but the profane person giv∣eth God neither outward nor inward man.— You know not, if you think we come into this wilderness to practise those courses here which we fled from in England. We believe there is a vast difference between men's inventions and God's institutions; we fled from men's in∣ventions, to which we else should have been compelled; we compel <HI>none</HI> to men's inventions. If our ways (rigid ways as you call them) have laid us low in the hearts of God's people. yea and of the saints (as you stile them) we do not believe it is <HI>any part</HI> of their <HI>saintship.</HI>— Nevertheless, I tell you the truth, we have tolerated in <HI>our</HI> church some <HI>anabaptists</HI>—and do still to this day.—We are far from arro∣gating infallibility of judgment to ourselves. You see how desirous we are to give you what satisfaction we may to your loving expostula∣tion.</Q></P>
<P>Here observe,
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Our most noted fathers, flinched at the first thought of using force with their neighbours in religion, and tried to turn the blame off to others.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. When they consi∣dered that they did not mean to hold any wrong principle or practice, but were in earnest to pro∣mote the right way, they argued that surely o∣thers ought to go in that way too; and there∣fore,</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. That it must be their <HI>will</HI> that kept them therefrom, which <HI>will</HI> ought to be <HI>compel∣led.</HI></ITEM>
<ITEM>4. If they could not bring such persons hearts into the right way, yet that it were better for God to have their bodies, than to loose bo∣dy and soul both.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. Those who do not like
<PB N="105" REF="012655_0104_0F8BBE9603D25520"/>such treatment, have liberty to keep their dis∣tance, but if they <HI>will</HI> come into our jurisdiction, their imprisonment is <HI>no detriment,</HI> for we cause them to fare as well there, as at home.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. By this time it is become good <HI>manners</HI> with such <HI>learning</HI> to charge a noted christian magistrate with <HI>ignorance,</HI> if he could so much as <HI>think</HI> that there was not a <HI>vast difference</HI> between the <HI>compel∣lings</HI> to men's inventions, practised by old perse∣cutors in England, and these <HI>compellings</HI> which were used by good christians, who fled into a wilderness from such bad courses.</ITEM>
<ITEM>7. Men of the greatest learning or piety in England, must have nothing go into their <HI>characters</HI> as <HI>saints</HI> which condems the <HI>compelling</HI> conduct of the saints here, yet</ITEM>
<ITEM>8. The saints in this wilderness are so far from arrogating infalibility to themselves, that if others will join with <HI>them</HI> while they are not of their judgment concerning the initiating ordinance of the church, free liberty is granted so to do; but to act their own judgment in a separate society, that must not be tolerated.</ITEM>
</LIST></P>
<P>And now Mr. <HI>F.</HI> if you cant see some features of <HI>yourself</HI> in this glass, one would be ready to think you was got into such a case as the learned Dr. Young tells of, viz. to need spectacles to see a mountain. Yet should that be the case, you have a pair very handy; for only look into the 74th and 75th pages of your sermons, and you will find it declared, That the rules our Lord has given are <HI>perfect,</HI> but that the wisest and best of men are <HI>imperfect,</HI> and know but <HI>in part,</HI> therefore when they come, it may be, with hearts <HI>equally honest,</HI> and consciences <HI>alike tender,</HI> to ap∣ply those rules, they conclude upon different
<PB N="106" REF="012655_0105_0F8BBE9AAB55C7D0"/>forms of divine service; which renders it difficult, if not <HI>impracticable</HI> for them to worship harmo∣niously together. And how do you know but that this is the very case with your dissenting brethren? Will you have the face to pretend to know that their <HI>hearts</HI> were not <HI>equally honest</HI> with your's! If not, then what a violation of rule have you been guilty of, in trying to strip them of all their <HI>virtues,</HI> and to draw their <HI>characters</HI> to the world only from their <HI>imperfections!</HI> Yet you say, <Q>I acted agreeable to the <HI>golden rule,</HI> in telling them <HI>of,</HI> and reproving them <HI>for</HI> their <HI>imperfections</HI> and errors: for surely, that rule don't oblige us to tell a brother all his <HI>good properties,</HI> when we go to reprove him for his faults.</Q> p. 19. Perhaps if you again look over our Lord's treatment of the seven churches of Asia, you will find your <HI>surely,</HI> to be a mistake as to the manner of reproving; but Sir, that was not the work that you was about, by your own account the principal design of your ser∣mons, was to draw the separates <HI>character before others</HI> instead of reproving <HI>them:</HI> and a principal article of advice and exhortation in your con∣clusion, given out to the world is, <Q>Go not af∣ter THEM nor follow THEM.—<HI>keep your dis∣tance</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In your sermons p. 164, you applied Isa. 65.5. to 28; but who is it now that says, <HI>stand by thy self, come not near ME!</HI></NOTE> from THEM. Beware that you neither <HI>interrupt</HI> their devotion, nor <HI>join</HI> with THEM in their worship. How can you with any <HI>good conscience</HI> after I HAVE SHOWN you from whence they arose, their principles, spirit and
<PB N="107" REF="012655_0106_OF8BBE9D555098"/>tendency.</Q> Ser. p. 191. Is this your way to reprove brethren!</P>
<P>Should you Sir, try again to evade conviction by pretending that I have forgot my subject, and instead of opening the <HI>difference,</HI> have shewn an <HI>exact likeness,</HI> between you and our fathers. I reply that this is a great mistake; and to intro∣duce a short view of the difference, I would refer you to Ezek. 43.7, 9. And whatever may be the primary meaning of the text, I believe there is no injustice in accommodating it to the case in hand. A house filled with the <HI>carcases</HI> of fathers and rulers, cannot prove that it is <HI>the spiritual house</HI> which they built with <HI>lively stones.</HI> And to examine whether something of this nature does not appear in New-England, let the following points be considered.</P>
<LIST>
<ITEM>1. Dr. Owen, who for some time was expect∣ed, and always was much esteemed here, evident∣ly expressed the sentiments of our most eminent fathers, as to the <HI>succession</HI> of ministers, when he observed, that it is <HI>sufficiently</HI> secured, by our Lord's erecting that office, and giving warrant for it's continuance to the end; and by his continu∣ance according to his promise, to communicate <HI>spi∣ritual gifts</HI> unto men for the edification of his church; whose duty it is to chuse, call and solemnly <HI>set a part</HI> unto the office of the ministry such as Christ <HI>by his spirit</HI> has made meet for it, according to the rule of his word; and then he says, <Q>Those who plead for the continuation of a <HI>successive ministry,</HI> without respect unto <HI>these things,</HI> without resolving both the <HI>authority</HI> and <HI>office</HI> of it <HI>un∣to them,</HI> do but erect a <HI>dead image</HI> or imbrace a <HI>dead</HI> CARCASE, instead of the <HI>living</HI> and <HI>life-giving</HI>
<PB N="108" REF="012655_0107_0F8BBE9C05977908"/>institutions of Christ.</Q><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Original of churches p. 165.</NOTE> Compare this with what you reckon one of our fathers worst mistakes, p. 47.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. Our fathers had such a <HI>spirit of faith</HI> in preaching,<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">2 Cor. 4.13.</NOTE> that the same Mr. Cotton whom we were but now treating of, declared, that the <HI>difference</HI> will ever hold between the word <HI>read</HI> and <HI>preached,</HI> they are <HI>two distinct</HI> ordinances. Herein we hold with him; but you do not. Ex. p. 72.73.</ITEM>
<ITEM>3. In the effect of such preach∣ing, which brought persons before all the assem∣bly to declare the <HI>workings of God's spirit in their hearts,</HI> we hold with our fathers, while many of your churches have not even the <HI>carcase</HI> of that custom left. Ex. p. 54, 55.</ITEM>
<ITEM>4. Tho' our fathers held to the use of compulsion in religion, yet they did not entrust such a power with any but <HI>brethren</HI> in their churches; but you Sir, put this compelling power into the hands of many who are not mem∣bers of any church at all.</ITEM>
<ITEM>5. As I have already shewn, they allowed none to <HI>vote</HI> for rulers or mi∣nisters but members in full communion, and your beloved Mitchel declared, that it would <HI>ruin</HI> the churches if <HI>election of ministers</HI> were carried by a <HI>looser sort</HI> of members, Ex. p. 51. How then are they now <HI>ruined,</HI> when you are forced to own that <HI>worldly</HI> estate makes voters in such affairs! p. 83.</ITEM>
<ITEM>6. Though the first fathers of New-Eng∣land held to infant-baptism, yet they were so far from holding of it upon the footing you do, that though some tried hard to bring it on to that footing when Cambridge platform was composed, yet they were prevented the doing of it, as Dr.
<PB N="109" REF="012655_0108_0F8BBE9CC682D6F0"/>Mather tells us, by <HI>many worthy men.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mitchel's life p. 73.</NOTE> And such worthy men as Hooker, Cotton, Shepard, and others, were gone to eternity, and Mr. Nor∣ton was in England; when they introduced the scheme in 1662, which you embrace: and the aged president Chauncy, and Mr. Devenport, who were present, could not be easy with bear∣ing only a verbal, but they and others also bore a printed testimony against it.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Therefore it was contrary to truth for you to assert an <HI>exact agreement</HI> with them, even in the point of infant bap∣tism. p. 60.</NOTE></ITEM>
<ITEM>8. While our fathers were so much blinded as to think force was to be used in religion, they were in earnest to force men to <HI>conform</HI> to what they esteemed the right way, as well as to support it: but how little pains is now taken with men's persons, if they can but get their money!</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>In short, the greatest likeness that I can see be∣tween many of the present generation, and those fa∣thers is in a <HI>tenderness</HI> for <HI>self,</HI> and a want of ten∣derness for its opposites. Mr. Cotton could readily sind a divine example, where self was affected, for not proceeding upon <HI>report,</HI> without a full examination whether they were <HI>altogether</HI> true or not; and also for not wrapping up the guilty and innocent together: yet how contrary there∣to is his treatment of the baptists in the same letter? And you sir, complain much of me for publishing many things concerning your de∣nomination, which you do not dispute the truth of (though I gave you a fair opportunity to do it, by naming persons and places, giving dates and quoting my vouchers) while you have treated
<PB N="110" REF="012655_0109_0F8BBE9D8ABFD0D8"/>us quite otherwise; and how have you now raked the streets of Canterbury for something against that church, and then you insinuate that we are not <HI>honest</HI> to own our principles, nor <HI>humble</HI> e∣nough to confess and put away our <HI>errors,</HI> because we do not own all that you are pleased to accuse us with! p. 113. As to the principle you there refer to, I did confess the truth concerning it, Ex. p. 50, and you must answer it to our great judge, for your insinuating the contrary here against me.</P>
<P>I am now prepared to answer your query, whether I had not forgotten my sect, when I expressed my concern for the fall of New-England from her ancient discipline? Ex. p. 92. And you say, <Q>Why did not his heart smite him, and his pen blot out that expression, of his deep concern for New-England, as fallen from its ancient purity and glory, because her mini∣sters to now testify against the corruptions of <HI>separation</HI> and <HI>anabaptism,</HI> just as the fathers in the first churches did?</Q> p. 111.</P>
<P>Answer 1. The forgoing account plainly shews that they were so much blinded by <HI>self,</HI> as to try to justify such treatment of dissenters from <HI>them,</HI> as one of their chief magistrates calls <HI>Tyranny, persecution</HI> and <HI>rigid ways;</HI> and as learned saints on the other side of the water, veiwed to be so, even in their most solemn exercises. Yea the learned Mr. Neal (whom none, that have read his history of the <HI>puritans</HI> can suspect of being prejudiced in favour of the baptists) he does not scruple to declare, that in dealing with Mr. Clark and his brethren, they <Q>Broke in upon the <HI>natural rights</HI> of mankind, punishing men,
<PB N="111" REF="012655_0110_0F8BBE9E4F9BA2D0"/>not for disturbing the <HI>state,</HI> but for differing sentiments in religion.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">History of New-England, Vol. I. p. 303, 304.</NOTE></Q> And when Dr. Mather attempted to excuse a like treatment of the baptist church in Boston, which was formed May 28, 1665, by declaring it to be a violation of the law of the <HI>commonwealth</HI> relating to the <HI>orderly</HI> gathering of churches: which <HI>order</HI> was, not to do it without the approbation of <HI>magistrates</HI> and neighbouring <HI>ministers.</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Magnalia, B. 7. p. 27.</NOTE> Mr. Neal boldly replies,<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 304.</NOTE> that this plea <Q>Condemns all the dis∣senting congregations that have been gathered in England since the act of <HI>uniformity</HI> in the year 1662.</Q> And can our fathers tyranny, per∣secution and rigid ways, ever justify your doing the like!</P>
<P N="2">2. While they accused the baptists of <HI>wil∣fulness,</HI> they most evidently discovered a great <HI>bias</HI> and <HI>prepossession</HI> against them in their own minds. I noted before that Mr. Hooker, and from him Mr. Mitchel, <HI>resoved</HI> to have an ar∣gument able to <HI>remove a mountain,</HI> before they would recede from infant baptism. Ex. p. 98. And Mr. Cotton, in a piece he wrote on that subject, against such as he owns did not, <Q>deny magistrates, nor predestination, nor original sin; nor maintain free-will in conversion, nor apostacy from grace: but only denied the lawful use of the baptism of children, because it wanteth a word both of commandment and example from the scripture.</Q> Yea that he was bound to believe that they did this <Q>out of
<PB N="112" REF="012655_0111_0F8BBE9F07047E58"/>conscience, as following the example of the apostle:</Q> yet he goes on to declare, that he also believed, that <HI>satan</HI> had <HI>yielded</HI> so far in these stirring times of reformation, as to plead no other argument than what may be urged from that main principle of reformation, <Q>That no duty of God's worship, nor ordinance of religion is to be administered in the church, but such as hath just warrant from the word of God.</Q> And (says he) by urging this argument against the <Q>baptism of children, satan transformeth him∣felf into an angel of light.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Cotton or the <HI>grounds and ends of the baptism of children.</HI> Printed 1647. p. 3, 4,</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>About the same time a minister at Lynn, wrote against a number of baptist authors; but before he came to any of their arguments, he compares the admitting any <HI>scruple</HI> about infant baptism, to mother Eve's <HI>admitting</HI> the serpent's question, <HI>Hath God said it?</HI> and says, <Q>Let my advice be grateful to thee thus far, christian reader, to take heed of unnecessary discourses and disputes with <HI>satanical suggestions.</HI>—It is not the first age and time that satanical sug∣gestions, <HI>Thus it is written,</HI> and <HI>Thus saith the Lord,</HI> hath been propounded.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Mr. Thomas Cobbet's <HI>vindication of the covenant, and church estate of children.</HI> Printed 1648. Epistle to the reader. p. 8—9.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>Thus people were taught, to guard against the plainest scriptures that could be brought a∣gainst infant baptism as being from satan; and Mr. Cobbet, near the close of his book<NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Page 295.</NOTE> calls it a <HI>a profane trick,</HI> for any to turn their backs
<PB N="113" REF="012655_0112_0F8BBEA01ADF3620"/>when an infant was going to be sprinkled, and <HI>blasphemy</HI> to stile that practice antichristian.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It was doubtless in consequence of such teaching as this that the following law was made in Boston, 1644, viz. Al∣though no human power be Lord over the faith, and con∣sciences of men, yet because such as bring in damnable he∣resies, tending to the subversion of the christian faith, and de∣struction of the souls of men, ought duly to be restrained from such notorious impieties.
<P>It is therefore ordered and declared by the court; that if any christian within this jurisdiction, shall go about to sub∣vert and destroy the christian faith and religion, by broach∣ing and maintaining any damnable heresies: as denying the immortality of the soul, or resurrection of the body, or any sin to be repented of in the regenerate,—or denying that Christ gave himself a ransom for our sins,—or shall openly condemn or oppose the baptizing of infants, or shall pur∣posely depart the congregation, at the administration of that ordinance,—or shall endeavor to seduce others to ANY of the errors or heresies above mentioned; every such person con∣tinuing obstinate therein, after due means of conviction, shall be SENTENCED TO BANISHMENT. General laws and <HI>liberties</HI> of the <HI>Massachusetts</HI> colony, revised and re-printed by order of the general court at <HI>Boston, May</HI> 15, 1672. p. 58, 59.</P></NOTE></P>
<P>But alas! how dreadfully had satan <HI>yielded</HI> when he had <HI>prevailed</HI> with those fathers, to take his weapons of <HI>slander</HI> and <HI>violence,</HI> to support an ordinance that they could not find a <HI>Thus saith the Lord</HI> for! By these wiles he has prevailed, even to this day, so as to prejudice many in each denomination, against giving the other a fair hearing; and against embracing truths and du∣ties that the others held.</P>
<P N="3">3. Our most noted fathers owned themselves to be <HI>imperfect</HI> (and left us evidence enough of it's being so) therefore they solemnly charged
<PB N="114" REF="012655_0113_0F8BBEA26B75C350"/>us, not to stop in what they had attained. This I before proved, Ex. p. 102. To which I shall now add the words of Mr. Devenport, who fled into Holland from perfecution before he came to our land; and where he <Q>Bore witness a∣gainst their <HI>promiscuous baptisms,</HI> which (in his account) bordered very near upon a <HI>profana∣tion</HI> of that holy institution. He observed, That when a <HI>reformation</HI> of the church has been brought about in any part of the world, it has rarely been afterwards carried on any step farther than the <HI>first reformers</HI> did succeed in their <HI>first</HI> endeavours. He observed that as easily might the <HI>ark</HI> have been removed from the mountains of <HI>Ararat,</HI> where it first grounded, as a people get any ground in re∣formation, after and beyond the first remove of the reformers. And this observation quickned him to embark in a design of re∣formation, wherein he might have opportuni∣ty to drive things in the first essay, as near to the precept and pattern of scripture as they could be driven.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Magnalia, B. 111. p. 53.</NOTE></Q> No wonder then that he bore witness here also, against their degenerating into <HI>promiscuous baptisms</HI> in 1662. The effects of which were so great by the year 1700, as to cause Dr. Mather, (as I before noted Ex. p. 19) to declare, that <Q>If the begun <HI>apostacy</HI> should proceed as fast for thirty years,—surely it will come to that in New-England, that the <HI>most conscientious</HI> people therein will think themselves concerned to <HI>gather churches out of churches.</HI></Q> How then could my heart smite
<PB N="115" REF="012655_0114_0F8BBEA30C1BEA20"/>me for having such a concern! Rather must not your's smite you for saying, <Q>The glory of New-England departs, as the modern sepera∣tion prevails; our <HI>fathers being judges?</HI></Q> p. 112.</P>
<P>However, though our difference in sentiments is great, yet tis time to come to the second gene∣ral head that we agree in; which is of relating <HI>facts.</HI> You say, <Q>If they are <HI>true,</HI> he has not <HI>slandered</HI> us; but if they are <HI>false</HI> he <HI>has:</HI> and upon this hypothesis I am ready to join issue.</Q> p. 111. With this I concur, only with the pro∣viso, that a due regard be paid to the golden rule in the <HI>manner</HI> of doing it; which naturally brings us to my second <HI>witness,</HI> to prove your doing the contrary before: which was; that None can be willing to have the character of their <HI>whole</HI> denomination taken from evil persons and things which may be pickt out among them. Then I quoted a passage out of your sermons, to shew that you had done so to us. Ser. p. 142. Ex. p. 5. You now say the quotation <Q>Shows that I was not giving the character of the whole de∣nomination, but only of individuals.</Q> p. 2<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. Had you Sir, but have named the individuals, there would have been some sense in this answer, but since you have not done it, we must have recourse to a scripture instance. It is well known that when an open breach happens, either in church or state, persons of various characters and sentiments will resort to the new party. When the breach between Saul and David came to be known, <HI>every one that was in distress, and every one that was in debt, and discontented, gathered themselves unto</HI> David, <HI>and he became a Captain over
<PB N="116" REF="012655_0115_0F8BBEA7E73B26E0"/>them.</HI> Yet when such a character of his party as this was given, viz. <HI>There be many servants now a days that break away, every man from his master,</HI> it is called <HI>Railing;</HI> and we are told that the person who gave it, therein acted according to his name, which signifies, a <HI>fool</HI> or <HI>madman.</HI> 1 Sam. 22.2 and 25.10, 14, 25.</P>
<P>My third witness was to shew how you had tried to deprive people of hearing and judging for themselves, and had condemned us without a fair hearing. Ex. p. 5, 6. The sum of your reply to it is, That what you delivered was by way of warning and advice to your own people, and say, <Q>As for strangers,—the whole fraternity of separates—they are entirely out of the present question</Q> p. 20, 21. Yet Sir, you first spread printed proposals of subscription for your sermons, through the country, notifying what you had therein written against the <HI>sepa∣rates;</HI> and then the books were published and dispersed into all the four governments of New-England, and improved against our denomina∣tion in general, before I wrote against them, and I never heard of any one man, that took what you had said, in the <HI>limited</HI> sense you would now put upon it, till your reply came out. Which limi∣ted sense you also now fly to, for a screen from my charge, of your injuring the truth in relating of facts. p. 6. We must therefore come to par∣ticulars. And,</P>
<P N="1">1. You are forced to own yourself guilty of two mistakes about the separate minister in your own town. One is, you said the church silenced him: when in truth he silenced himself. The other is concerning the length of
<PB N="117" REF="012655_0116_0F8BBEA818504DE0"/>time that he was with them. You said, <HI>Less than a year;</HI> which saying you are now forced to own was more than a year from the truth; tho' you try hard to make out that I was as much or more mistaken than you was. p. 108. What you advance from the records of that church is entirely in my favour, excepting the date of Mr. Smith's excommunication, and you appear wil∣ling to render them doubtful, calling them, <HI>re∣cords</HI> or <HI>minutes;</HI> and what you chiefly rely up∣on, is a narrative you say, <Q>Taken from Mr. Smith's own <HI>mouth,</HI> as near as could be <HI>related</HI> by a gentleman of integrity (whose letter is in hand, and the <HI>substance of</HI> it is as follows.</Q>) p. 106. So that your chief authority to deter∣mine these <HI>facts,</HI> by your own account, is what was taken from an aged gentleman's memory, after above 20 years changes in this confused world, then wrote as near as another could re∣member, and a third gives the public the <HI>sub∣stance</HI> of what the second had written. Now I will give you my authorities. One of Mr. Smith's brethren in the ministry, who lived by the way between Stonington and Mansfield, in giving me an account of the state of religion in those parts, wrote thus.</P>
<P><Q>As for Stonington, brother Smith hath for some time denied to administer among them, and <HI>now</HI> hath concluded to return to Mansfield, and hath proceeded <HI>so far</HI> as to sell at Stoning∣ton, and bought at Mansfield; but the church unanimously against his going.</Q> This was written on April 17, 1749. Your account makes it a year after his removal before his ex∣comunication. Well my account of that is from
<PB N="118" REF="012655_0117_0F8BBEA8F1B25DC8"/>one of the council in which are these words. <Q>When we were come, and had heard the charge against him, as being a covenant-breaker, in that he had forsaken the work God had set him to do, namely, of preaching the gospel, and administring the ordinances there∣of; he was desired to give his reasons why he had so done. He gave this answer, That there was a want of fellowship, but to charge it to the church, or any particular brother he could not: and that was all, as I remember. And then the church declared how they had taken the steps prescribed in the gospel for his recovery, and all proved ineffectual. We all agreed that it was duty to proceed to pub∣lic censure and excommunication.—The day was the 20th of July; but as to the effect, God has it in his hands, and he orders all things well.</Q> This was written the last of September, 1750; and I have both of these letters in their authors own hand-writing, to shew to any who desire to see them. And let it be noted, that they were then wrote in way of intimate friend∣ship, containing our own language concerning these affairs, and not with any design of publish∣ing them to the world.</P>
<P>And by these accounts it appears, that he was ordained on <HI>December</HI> 10, 1746; but that after he had broken his solemn covenant to feed that flock of God, they took the gospel steps with him, and as he did not <HI>hear the church,</HI> he was excommunicated <HI>July</HI> 20, 1750. Yet you de∣clared in print, that <Q>Him <HI>they</HI> chose, ordain∣ed, <HI>silenced,</HI> cast out of the church, and deli∣vered
<PB N="119" REF="012655_0118_0F8BBEA988728190"/>up to satan, in <HI>less</HI> than <HI>a year.</HI></Q> Ser. p. 145. And now, twenty years after, you have collected a reproachful account of that affair from this dilinquent; and yet at the end of it (to avoid the charge of <HI>stigmatizing</HI> your breth∣ren) you say, <Q>I have ONLY rehearsed their deeds—I have ONLY published their princi∣ples, spirit, practices, &amp;c. which THEY <HI>them∣selves</HI> PROFESSED and acted over in the open view of the world.</Q> p. 110 Though but two pages back you was forced to own to the world, that you had published things against them that were not true; and that you was led to do it by <Q>Relying upon the <HI>information</HI> of <HI>neigh∣bours,</HI> and your own <HI>understanding</HI> of that affair.</Q></P>
<P>O Mr. <HI>Fish!</HI> how much guilt and trouble would you have escaped, if you had honestly re∣tracted all that you have done against your bre∣thren, through a <HI>leaning to your own understand∣ing,</HI> and acting contrary to the character of Zion's citizens? Psal. 15, 3. Isa. 33.15. May this be a warning and instruction to us all, in our future treatment of others!</P>
<P N="2">2. You Sir charged us with <HI>despising learning,</HI> and said we had <HI>None</HI> but <HI>unlearned teachers,</HI> and that we did not <HI>use means</HI> for obtaining <HI>any better accomplishments.</HI> Ser. p. 165. And now in order to maintain your charge, you would li∣mit the controversy to the word <HI>college;</HI> whereas the words in your charge were, ANY <HI>means; col∣leges,</HI> AND <HI>superior schools.</HI> And when I named two sons of Mr. Josiah Cleaveland of Canterbury, that he sent to college, you assert that he did it
<PB N="120" REF="012655_0119_0F8BBEAA5F42C308"/><Q>As one of the standing order, long enough <HI>before</HI> he separated.</Q> p. 14. while yet you tell us, that the <HI>part</HI> of the church he was of, on Jan. 27, 1743, <Q>Declared against and went <HI>off from</HI> their former usage.</Q> p. 76.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The truth I suppose is, that the church had not <HI>expli∣citly</HI> declared for either platform till then, when a majority voted for Cambridge, and against Saybrook, which was a cause of their separation.</NOTE> And if you examine you may find, that he did not send the last of his sons to college till September, 1744: and as they were both expelled that fall, for meeting with the church they were members of in a place <HI>separate</HI> from the parish meeting-house; and which the heads of the college de∣declared in print, that they were obliged to do by your laws. Ex. p. 42, 43. who could be so stupid as to send more sons there to be ex∣pelled! When that expelling temper was a lit∣tle over, I mentioned no less than six instances, out of but two towns, of separates sending their sons to college. Ex. p. 43. But you presume to question their doing of it from right motives: and because your party have prevailed to preju∣dice several of those sons against their fathers principles, you advance that as a great proof that their fathers are erroneous, p. 15. And as I spoke of some of our pastors having skill in the learned tongues, you name one of them, who at his earnest request was dismissed from Norwich, and you say he has <Q>Distinguished himself, to the honor of truth &amp; <HI>gospel order,</HI> by a public reflec∣tion upon himself for his error, in promoting separations from the standing churches, so much as he has done; and was some months
<PB N="121" REF="012655_0120_0F8BBEAB0D666798"/>ago ordained by regular ministers, over a re∣gular church and congregation in Plainfield.</Q> p. 15.</P>
<P>Reply, I learn that the ministers did extort from him some general reflections upon separa∣tions; yet the <HI>order</HI> that he was settled in was; dropping the old <HI>constitution,</HI> and beginning anew by a verbal relation of experiences; not using the civil law for his support, and not using notes in his preaching. And I am informed, that he lately assisted in ordaining a minister in your vici∣nity, who appears to be a man of <HI>spiritual gifts,</HI> though he has no more of college-learning than we had. And whether this can convince us that we were wrong in separating from <HI>your constitu∣tion,</HI> that we might introduce <HI>such gospel order</HI> (and which now spreads in your colony) let the reader judge! You close this article with telling your readers, that you had <HI>sufficiently proved</HI> your charge against us, but if any thing more is re∣quired, the <HI>spirit</HI> and <HI>language</HI> of my book may supply the place of <HI>many witnesses.</HI> p. 15. I am content to refer the matter to that test; for I trust it has appeared, and will appear to the end, that God has given me a real regard for <HI>knowledge</HI> and <HI>truth,</HI> but a hatred of <HI>ignorance</HI> and <HI>sophistry.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. In opening your constitution I mentioned the trouble that Norwich representatives met with for their opposing their ministers attempts to bring in the Saybrook scheme, and said that, Af∣ter many councils, and much fatigue, a <HI>sum of money</HI> prevailed with that minister to quit his place. Ex. p. 29. You now say, The sum of money was <HI>only</HI> for his temporal interest in the town. p. 72. To which I reply, that I had no
<PB N="122" REF="012655_0121_0F8BBEABCCFAC4E8"/>thought of blaming him for felling his estate there, thought I had an account of that from the same hands that I had the other; but as I find from the town records, that upon resigning his office, he made a demand of old arearages, beyond what the town judged to be any ways his due, I suppose that from thence it was taken that a cer∣tain sum was given him to quit his place. This is the clearest light I can as yet gain in the case. I am willing to have every mistake rectified, and that things may appear as they are. Had that been your temper Sir, would you have said A <HI>council.</HI> p. 72? as if he had been dismissed by the calling only of <HI>one</HI> council; when in truth they had them year after year, from soon after the introduction of the Saybrook plan in 1708, till that minister resigned his office on August 31, 1716. And would not an impartial disposition also have prevented, a long descant that you there add, upon Mr. Tennant's <HI>language,</HI> in order to turn it against us; when I expressly told you, that it was his <HI>reasoning</HI> and not his language that I approved of? Ex. p. 33. At the same time you pass over in silence what I brought against you from Mr. Edwards, which I as plain∣ly told you I preferred before the other. Is this the <HI>learning</HI> you plead so much for!</P>
<P N="4">4. You spend six pages upon the facts that I related concerning Canterbury, on which you reflect that <Q>'Tis sad that Mr. <HI>B.</HI> lays no restraint on his pen!</Q> p. 79. And you say, <Q>This may serve as a general caution to his readers, how they receive and rely upon his account of things in other parts of his book,</Q> p. 80. And give no hint that I
<PB N="123" REF="012655_0122_0F8BBEAC8658CD38"/>took every article which you controvert, from an author in that town, who was acquainted with all these affairs, and publickly appealed to mi∣nisters and courts for the truth of his narrative; and which I never heard disputed till your reply came out, while you keep your author's name concealed, who condemns me upon his present <HI>rememberance.</HI> p. 77. As far as I could now gain light from the several accounts that are given, I have corrected and opened the true state of that separation; but whether I can with safety retract any particular circumstance that is now disputed, which was published 20 years ago, by a man of credit that I was acquainted with, only upon the <HI>memory</HI> of one that I knew not, let the reader judge! And I shall close these facts with remarking, that you catch at my say∣ing, <HI>After</HI> the church withdrew, the consociation was called and ordained Mr. Cogswell, Ex. p. 38. as a proof that they did not <HI>cause that division.</HI> Rom. 16.17.18. p. 84. But Sir, I proved by the plain testimony of the heads of your col∣lege, that his <HI>preaching to the parish</HI> (which caus∣ed the church to withdraw) was <HI>with the special direction</HI> of those ministers. Ex. p. 42. And what a miserable shift is it, for you to catch at the word <HI>after,</HI> to prove that they did nothing be∣fore!</P>
<P>And now Sir, let us sum up the whole affair. You have accused me with using false argu∣ments, but how have you proved it? The first that I observe, is from my naming some of our ministers, who had been men of note in the places where they lived; you represent that from thence I argued, that they had college learning
<PB N="124" REF="012655_0123_0F8BBEADAE518758"/>(as if all learning was confined to colleges) and you form a ridiculous syllogism for me according∣ly. p. 13. But whether you or I are rendered most ridiculous by it, let the reader judge. A∣gain, when I observed that you <HI>mistook</HI> the rule itself through your book; my argument from it was, That nothing less could be expected, than false actings upon a false rule. Ex. p. 5. That is when a man is seduced into a <HI>crooked</HI> way, it cannot be expected that he will go <HI>strait</HI> in it. But you represent my argument to be, that you could not have an <HI>honest heart.</HI> p. 19. Notwith∣standing I expressly said, <Q>I desire always to avoid the evil of judging the <HI>counsels</HI> of others <HI>hearts,</HI> and to judge righteously according to what is made manifest.</Q> And I went on to tell what I supposed it was that <HI>blinded</HI> you. Ex. p. 5, 6. And I still suppose that you have been thus blinded, and moved to use shifts and evasions to try to clear yourself, and unreason∣bly to censure your opponent. Thus when I said, you had condemned <HI>us</HI> without a fair hearing; you reply <Q>They were out of my jurisdiction. I had no business to call <HI>them</HI> to a hearing.</Q> p. 21. As if I had spoken of a <HI>personal audience:</HI> when you know that I expressly referred to what we had <HI>published</HI> to the world, which you had paid no regard to. Ex. p. 6. So when I mentioned what the false teachers at Corinth <HI>gloried</HI> in, and (to confirm it) what the Corinthi∣ans <HI>suffered</HI> from them. Ex. p. 25, 26. You shuffle the matter over, till you would make your readers believe, that I held, that those teach∣ers <HI>glorying</HI> was in what the saints <HI>suffered</HI> from them. And though you will not allow that
<PB N="125" REF="012655_0124_0F8BBEAE35292180"/>Christ gave any orders to his apostles to preach freely, yet you have proved that Paul did preach so; and you carry it, that his design therein was to "cut off occasion of <HI>offence.</HI>" p. 68, 69. But I have no thought of his being afraid of <HI>offend∣ing</HI> those teachers; for what he was evidently concerned about was to prevent any occasion or handle for them to do mischief. Once more, When I observed that the epistles to Timothy and Titus were to direct ministers concerning their behaviour <HI>in the church,</HI> not <HI>over it.</HI> I im∣mediately went on to explain my meaning; and that by <HI>over it,</HI> I meant a distinct power or juris∣diction <HI>above</HI> the church, instead of acting <HI>with</HI> them in trying ministers. Ex. p. 39, 41. But you Sir, quote several texts wherein the word <HI>over</HI> is used to describe ministers work as <HI>watch∣men</HI> or <HI>guides</HI> to the church, which perfectly agrees with my sense of the word <HI>in</HI> it, as being <HI>leaders</HI> therein; while you go on, (as before observed) to assert, that what the <HI>Spirit saith unto the churches</HI> was "spoken to and <HI>of</HI> the ministers;" and pro∣ceed till you represent, that I held that letters of commendation went <HI>to</HI> and <HI>from</HI> the <HI>brotherhood</HI> and <HI>not</HI> the <HI>ministers,</HI> though I plainly said the church <HI>with</HI> them. p. 80—83.</P>
<P>And so I think it is lamentably evident. that you have proceeded in a crooked way through these writings, both as to arguments, and facts: while I have not been able to discover that I have used one false argument against you; and the chief mistakes that I have found are, my writing The form, instead of A form of God∣liness; and my being misinformed about one circumstance at Norwich.</P>
<P><PB N="126" REF="012655_0125_0F8BBEB551181558"/>
As for temper; you talk much of my want of <HI>modesty,</HI> but the two plainest instances to shew what you mean by it, that I have observed, are my appearing so boldly as I have, against you about the learned tongue, and against the Windham ministers upon the parable of the tares. p. 55.87. which cases as they have been plainly stated I leave with the reader. But you say, I have used <Q>Unsufferable PERTNESS, surprising CONFIDENCE, and a haughty air of ASSURANCE.</Q> p. 123. To which I reply, that I have so often seen people lost in a wilderness of words, so as to take wrong for right, and right for wrong, that I have endea∣voured to come as <HI>pert</HI> and direct to the case in hand as I could; and as the sufferings of Christ's servants formerly, caused many of the <HI>brethren</HI> to wax <HI>confident,</HI> boldly to speak the word <HI>without fear;</HI> I shall not derry my belief, that this unworthy creature has been freely favoured with something of the same influence; and also with a measure of that <HI>assurance</HI> of <HI>understanding</HI> in gospel mysteries, which the apostle was earnest we should have, to guard us against <HI>philosophy and vain deceit.</HI> Phil. 1.14. Col. 2.1—8. If my confidence has in any instance gone be∣yond my evidence, I am sorry you had not con∣vinced me of it. You add, that <Q>This offence is aggravated by a total want of <HI>good manners,</HI> and <HI>civil language,</HI> through a great part of your book.</Q> p. 123. To which I shall say, that though I never thought myself a pattern of manners, yet in these affairs, I'll venture to com∣pare notes with you. In your appendix where you professedly set yourself to collect out of my whole book, <HI>expressions</HI> most <HI>void of decency,</HI> the
<PB N="127" REF="012655_0126_0F8BBEB62BF2CB20"/>hardest names you have found are these, viz. I closed my remarks upon your applying the learn∣ing that our Saviour received by the holy Ghost, Isa. 50.4. to what is <HI>learned</HI> in your colleges, with saying, Did any <HI>Pharisee</HI> ever abuse scrip∣ture to impose upon people, worse than this? Ex. p. 44. And when you appealed to the <HI>Lord of conscience,</HI> whether it was not <HI>covetousness,</HI> ac∣companied with <HI>wilfulness</HI> and <HI>disobedience,</HI> all founded on <HI>weakness,</HI> rather than <HI>pure conscience</HI> that induced the separates to refuse to pay your salary? Ser. p. 164, I said, Does he or his bre∣thren take Paul's advice and direction, about dealing with <HI>weak brethren?</HI> or rather is not the liberty which they would allow, just the same with <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s,—<HI>Go ye, serve the Lord; only let your flocks and herds be stayed?</HI> Ex. p. 80.</P>
<P>These are the two plainest proofs, in their "native dress," of my want of good manners, that you have found in my whole book, and both of them delivered by way of query: whereas I have already referred you to one passage (among many) in your sermons, wherein you Sir, as a public minister, deliver it not as a question, but a strong assertion, that <Q>'Twas a <HI>false spirit,</HI> and a <HI>false religion</HI> that made the separation among US, a device of <HI>satan</HI> that old <HI>serpent</HI> the <HI>devil.</HI></Q> And in your present piece, which tells us in its introduction, that <Q>There is not the least need of one <HI>bitter word,</HI> nor unkind <HI>reflection,</HI> nor can there ANY <HI>purpose</HI> be answered thereby, but <HI>venting the corruption of nature,</HI></Q> p. 3. Yet in order to ward off the sentences I had quoted from those eminent authors, Owen and Franck, you say,— <Q>Our real character is as different from that which he has set up, as the true
<PB N="128" REF="012655_0127_0F8BBEB656FDDD40"/>protestant churches are from the antichris∣tian: or as the apostle <HI>Peter</HI> was from the <HI>Pope</HI> of Rome; or the gentle <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Paul,</HI> from Mr. <HI>Backus.</HI> And I know not of a more striking contrast.</Q> p. 102. Rather you should have said, you did not then think of any; for a more striking contrast came afterwards to mind, and then out it comes; which is that be∣tween the <HI>Arch-angel</HI> and the <HI>devil.</HI> Yea, and all this has not <HI>vented nature</HI> enough; but (as if the witch of Endor was come again, to bring up the dead to condemn the living) you assert that, <HI>I am compared</HI> BY Mr. <HI>Flavel</HI> to animals, too nau∣cious for dogs! And you go on to tell me, that all this <Q>correction is <HI>gentle</HI> compared with the offence.</Q> p. 124, 125.</P>
<P>If all these <HI>words</HI> are gentle, I know not what you would have more but <HI>blows</HI> from the secular arm. However it all serves still further to open the case we are upon. It had got to be customary in our land, to have ministers <HI>persons</HI> so much in <HI>admiration,</HI> as to allow them almost all the power in the admission both of ministers and members, and to treat them with such reverence as scarcely to oppose them in any thing. Therefore when some were raised up to appear boldly against their corruptions, they had recourse to many shifts and evasions, to hide the true state of the controversy, while they <HI>vented their natures</HI> as you have done, by calling the worst names, and using the most odious comparisons, that their <HI>learning</HI> afforded. And I am bold in it, that such kind of <HI>manners</HI> from men of your sort of education, was not only a great cause of our separation, but also has done more towards prejudiceing peoples minds against college-learning, than all those you call lay-teachers could have done if they had
<PB N="129" REF="012655_0128_0F8BBEB70931BE98"/>tried. And had I not been clearly convinced hereof, and seen what stumbling-blocks had been laid thereby, and also found the weight of that command, <HI>Go through, go through the gates,</HI> &amp;c. Isa. 62.10. I should by no means have pursued these matters so far as I have done. But here you tell us, you will leave it to the judicious rea∣der, <Q>whether he has skilfully and faithfully done the service; or whether he has not cast <HI>twenty stones</HI> at the <HI>prophets</HI> of the Lord, his <HI>ministers,</HI> to <HI>one</HI> that he has removed out of the way of <HI>his people?</HI></Q> p. 17. As I have seriously considered of this affair, I freely join in referring of it to all christian people; and if any can shew me that I have cast one stone at any such person, my concern shall be to improve the first opportu∣nity that presents, to make them the best satis∣faction I can. I know that my aim has not been against any human person, but against <HI>Je∣zebel</HI> which calleth herself a <HI>prophetess,</HI> that has been <HI>suffered</HI> to <HI>teach</HI> among the churches, and to <HI>seduce Christ's servants.</HI> And I desire never to spare her in the least, till she sinks like a <HI>stone,</HI> never to <HI>rise</HI> more. Jer. 51.64. Rev. 2.20. By which I understand all that <HI>mystery of iniquity</HI> by which any are <HI>seduced,</HI> to set up or gratify self under the cloak of religion, with methods of <HI>deceit</HI> and <HI>cruelty</HI> towards others. Which methods are used by some to as bad purposes, under the name of Great <HI>spirituality,</HI> as they are by others under a pretence of <HI>learning.</HI> And if a Peter or a Bar∣nabas, are carried away with <HI>dissimulation,</HI> they ought to be withstood <HI>to the face,</HI> and the so do∣ing, argues not any want of respect, either to their persons, or their office, but the contrary. Gal. 2.11—14.</P>
<P><PB N="130" REF="012655_0129_0F8BBEB7CA2588C0"/>
You Sir, talk much of how you and your bre∣thren stood by the work and cause of God when we separated, and say, The breach of <HI>peace</HI> began on our side, p. 18, 126. But surely the nature of his work, is to bring souls to the knowledge of their lost condition, and of the only way of help through Jesus Christ, and to follow him in all his ways, and not to follow the <HI>voice of strangers.</HI> And we followed the ministers who were friends to that work, till they turned and said a <HI>confede∣racy</HI> with the enemies of it, and joined in the manner you have done, to bear down all that would not conform to the <HI>constitution</HI> which I have now exposed; so that we were bro't to the necessity, of either yielding to that <HI>yoke of bond∣age,</HI> or else to separate from them. And the same argument was often used then that you use now, viz. That the seven churches of Asia were as corrupt as your's, who ('twas said) were cal∣led to reformation, but not to a separation. But how falacious is this argument? We know they were first called to a reformation; to <HI>repent and do their first works,</HI> and not to suffer <HI>deceitful</HI> teachers among them, who like <HI>Balaam</HI> loved the wages of unrighteousness. And their Lord de∣clared to them, that if they did not <HI>repent quick∣ly,</HI> he would <HI>remove the candlestick out of his place,</HI> and <HI>fight against them with the sword of his mouth.</HI> Rev. 2.5, 16. Which I believe he has done, and is now doing to your churches.</P>
<P>These things I leave to your solemn considerati∣on, desiring always to take the same advice my∣self, and rest, dear Sir, your hearty well-wisher,</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX, Containing a few remarks upon the controversy about baptism; occasioned by Mr. <HI>Elisha Fish</HI>'s late sermon from Gen. IX. 27.</HEAD>
<P>DR. <HI>Gill</HI> observes, that there has been scarce any thing wrote by us these fifty years but in our own defence; our Pedobaptist brethren being continually the aggressors, and first movers of the controversy; they seem as if they were not satisfied with what has been done on their side; and therefore are always attempting, either to put the controversy upon a new foot, or to throw the old arguments into a new form; and even say the same things over and over again, to make their minds, and the minds of their people easy, if possible. But this is our case; if we reply to what is written against us, then we are litigious persons, and lovers of controversy; though we only rise up in our own vindication, for which surely we are not to be blamed; and if we make no reply, then what is written is un∣answerable by us, and we are triumphed over.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr. Gill's answer to a piece called,</HI> The baptism of in¦fants a reasonable service, founded upon scripture and apostolic tradition. <HI>p. 3, 4.</HI></NOTE> Which observation is as applicable to our coun∣try
<PB N="132" REF="012655_0131_0F8BBEB9C38CD040"/>as to that in which it was wrote; for Mr, Jo∣seph Fish first began the controversy with us in his nine sermons; yet because I, at the importu∣nity of friends, made some reply to him, he ac∣cuses me with setting up myself as censor gene∣ral, &amp;c. And 'tis likely the same temper will renew the accusation, for my yielding to a like importunity, in taking some notice of the pam∣phlet before me; which is intitled, <Q>Japheth dwelling in the tents of Shem; or infant bap∣tism vindicated, in a discourse, the substance of which was delivered in Upton, January 5, 1772; with objections answered, by <HI>Elisha Fish,</HI> A. M.</Q> I say, some notice; for I shall not go over all the arguments again, which I have already answered in the foregoing discourse, but refer the reader thereto, and shall now only make a few remarks on their general manner of managing the controversy.</P>
<P>After Job's long dispute with his friends, Je∣hovah appeared with this solemn demand, <HI>Who is this that darkeneth counsel by</HI> WORDS <HI>without</HI> KNOWLEDGE! Job. 38.2. And a very great evil that the Corinthians were reproved for, was their uttering <HI>words</HI> that were not <HI>easy to be un∣derstood,</HI> but like a trumpet which gave an <HI>un∣certain sound.</HI> 1 Cor. 14.8, 9. Yet one of the greatest masters of learning in our nation ob∣serves, that commonly the most <HI>material words</HI> in controversy, upon which the argument turns, are so used; though says he, <Q>one who should speak thus, in the affairs and business of the world, and call 7 sometimes 8, and sometimes nine, as best served his advantage, would presently have clapped upon him one of the two names
<PB N="133" REF="012655_0132_0F8BBEBA4C0AE6A8"/>men constantly are disgusted with; and yet in arguing and learned contests, the same sort of proceeding passes commonly for wit and learning: but to me, it appears a greater dis∣honesty, than the misplacing of counters, in the casting up a debt, and the cheat the greater, by how much truth is of greater con∣cernment and value than money.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lock's essay on understanding, B. 3. C. 10. S. 5.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>With grief of heart we often see this to be the case, with the advocates for infant baptism. Could they once be brought to a distinct and steady meaning in three words, the controversy would soon come to an end. I mean the words, covenant, grace and promise. It is evident that in the old testament, to be in Abraham's <HI>covenant,</HI> meant the same as to be members of that church, and under obligation to conform to all its ordi∣nances. Natural birth brought his seed into the church, and being in, all their males must needs be circumcised as soon as they were <HI>clean.</HI> Levit. 12, 2, 3. <HI>And all their males</HI> were requir∣ed to keep the passover in the first month, if <HI>clean</HI> and not in a journey; and if that were the case, they might not neglect it any longer than the next month, upon the penalty of being <HI>cut off from their people,</HI> Gen. 17.14. Num. 9.9—13. Deut. 16.16. and do any hold the <HI>covenant</HI> to be so with us? Indeed some of our most noted fathers say, <Q>We know of NO stronger argu∣ment for infant baptism than this, That <HI>church members</HI> are to be baptized.<NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Magnalia B. 5. p. 79.</NOTE></Q> And from the scriptures just now cited, 'tis evident,
<PB N="134" REF="012655_0133_0F8BBEBF777FA828"/>that Abraham's seed <HI>born in the church,</HI> and there∣fore must be <HI>cut off</HI> from it, if they were not cir∣cumcised at the appointed time; and must we then take our opponents, by <HI>grace</HI> to mean <HI>nature;</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Directly contrary to having, NO <HI>confidence in the flesh.</HI> Phil. 3.3.</NOTE> and that <HI>nature</HI> brings their seed into the covenant of <HI>grace!</HI> And that though the gospel church was first constituted of members who were <HI>born not of blood</HI> nor of the <HI>will of man</HI> but OF GOD. John. 1.13! yet that since the establishment of christianity, <HI>blood</HI> and the <HI>will of man,</HI> can bring members into the church! But why then do not all these members come to the ordinance of the supper, as the Jews did to the passover? our author's answer is, That the passover was temporary and <HI>legal,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Circumcision was as <HI>temporary</HI> and <HI>legal</HI> as the passover, and is much oftener spoken of as such. Rom. 2.25. Gal. 5.2, 3. and 6.13.</NOTE> and he says, <Q>If it had been the will of the great Head of the church, not to have appointed any gospel passo∣ver or holy supper for his church, that would not have altered the privileges of the <HI>promises</HI> relating to baptism in Abraham's covenant, one way or the other.</Q> p. 37. 38.</P>
<P>To which I reply, that if he had not appointed baptism nor the supper, it would not have altered the <HI>promises</HI> to Abraham, for there is no mention of either of those ordinances therein; but 'tis certain that the promises to him did insure the con∣tinuance of the church in the line of his posterity till the <HI>seed Christ</HI> should come, <HI>to whom the pro∣mises were made.</HI> Gal. 3.16. And till then their establishment in all the <HI>legal ceremonies</HI> was
<PB N="135" REF="012655_0134_0F8BBEC207B8FD60"/><HI>as God promised</HI> him. Deut. 29.13. But when Christ came, all the children of Abraham's <HI>flesh,</HI> who believed not in him, were broken off from the church of God, while the <HI>children of promise,</HI> the <HI>election of grace</HI> were retained therein; and a <HI>new covenant</HI> was made with them <HI>not according</HI> to that made with their fathers; and many of the children of Japheth were <HI>persuaded,</HI> and graf∣fed in among them, and <HI>stood</HI> there <HI>by faith.</HI> Rom. 9.7.8 &amp; 11. and 5.17.20. Heb. 8. All which may plainly teach us, that to be in <HI>cove∣nant,</HI> means the same as being in the church, both in the old testament, and in the new; and that <HI>grace</HI> means <HI>free salvation</HI> by Christ, whom Abra∣ham and other believers looked to, through the shadows of the law, and who is now beheld with open face through the glass of the gospel; and that the blessings that God <HI>promised</HI> to Abraham, which are come on the Gentiles, are <HI>forgive∣ness of sins,</HI> and the influences of the holy <HI>spirit;</HI> which <HI>promise is given to them that believe.</HI> Acts 2.38, 39, 41. Gal. 3.13, 14, 22.</P>
<P>This is evidently the strait line of truth, but the crooked way of <HI>deceitful</HI> philosophy and men's <HI>traditions,</HI> as it carried Peter and Barnabas away with <HI>dissimulation,</HI> so it has carried this author (let him be ever so pious) into the following evils.</P>
<P N="1">1. To <HI>add</HI> to God's word; for that word calls the covenant that formed Abraham's family into a church, <HI>The covenant of circumcision.</HI> Acts 7.8. And as all know that circumcision is out of date, it would appear the evident consequence, that the covenant which it gave name to is also <HI>taken away,</HI> and a better one <HI>established</HI> in it's room. Heb. 8, 6. and 10.9. Had not men presumed
<PB N="136" REF="012655_0135_0F8BBEC2EA6E55D0"/>to add the name <HI>grace</HI> to it, on which addition most of their arguments for infant baptism turn. And to support this they make another additi∣on; for where the word says of Abraham, <HI>He re∣ceived</HI> the <HI>sign</HI> of circumcision, a <HI>seal</HI> of the righte∣ousness of <HI>the faith which he had.</HI> Rom. 4.11. This writer is so daring as to assert, that Abraham <Q>has set us the most public example in <HI>applying</HI> the seal of the righteousness of faith to his in∣fant seed, at God's command; which seal now is baptism.</Q> p. 29. In which, unless he can make Abraham's <HI>receiving</HI> what <HI>he had</HI> faith in, to be the same as <HI>applying</HI> to others what they had no faith about, he will be found guilty of adding to God's word. Yea he not only adds what is not there, but 2. He also denies what is there; for he over and over denies, there being any <HI>express</HI> word against bringing infants into the church now, as they did among the Jews. p. 13, 33, 39, 40. Notwithstanding God's express declaration, That the new covenant is <HI>not accord∣ing</HI> to the covenant that took in professors by <HI>housholds,</HI> and that the extent of the new cove∣nant is, that ALL shall <HI>know him,</HI> from the LEAST to the greatest. Heb. 8.11. Which declara∣tion our great author tries to evade by asserting, That the apostle here did not refer to the cove∣nant of Abraham, <Q>which had the token of cir∣cumcision annexed to it.</Q> p. 15. And though he owns that the usual language of the new-testa∣ment is, repent and believe and be baptized, yet he says, <Q>We do not discover the least oppositi∣on to the practice of infant baptism, which takes place and follows upon our visible and credible profession.</Q> p. 34. But stay; how
<PB N="137" REF="012655_0136_0F8BBEC318F22390"/>does it follow? Abraham had no warrant to circumcise one person, but such as were either <HI>born in his house,</HI> or <HI>bought with his money.</HI> Gen. 17.13, 23. The first order that was given to bring <HI>strangers</HI> to circumcision by <HI>housholds,</HI> was on <HI>the day</HI> that Israel came out of Egypt, Exod. 12.48. and the covenant which Jeremiah prophesied of, and which Paul applies to the gospel dispen∣sation is placed in <HI>express</HI> opposition to what was done on <HI>that day.</HI> Therefore all those who bring any family to baptism upon the faith of the head of it, act directly against these scriptures; and in order to keep themselves in countenance in that way, they go on, 3. To abusive treatment of those who will not go with them. This writer represents that our sentiments, would make Paul to contradict himself, which none but a <HI>prejudiced</HI> or <HI>infidel</HI> mind will admit. p. 16. He tells us of <HI>incredible presumption;</HI> of opposing the <HI>exact ful∣filment</HI> of his text, and that those who <Q>oppose infant baptism, are in danger of <HI>fighting a∣gainst God</HI> (at unawares).</Q> p. 23.24. Of rais∣ing an unanswerable objection in the minds of the Jews; and of too much resembling <HI>them</HI> in <HI>their unbelief.</HI> p. 25. Of offering <HI>violence to the scriptures.</HI> p. 28. Of <HI>horrible</HI> sentiments. p. 38. And all to enforce his advice, to <HI>shun</HI> the doc∣trines and practices of such as <HI>oppose</HI> his opinion about <HI>children.</HI> p. 39. Nay all this is not enough, but 4. He must add one of the worst errors of popery; I mean that of the sacraments <HI>con∣ferring grace by the operation or work done.</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Here note, I don't charge Mr. <HI>F.</HI> with knowingly holding this error; he declares the contrary. p. 38. and would have it, that when the fathers called baptism <HI>regene∣ration,</HI> they used the thing signified for the sign. p. 43. But the case is evidently not so. I readily own that circumcision under the law, and baptism under the gospel, were both signs of Christ's death, and of regeneration by his grace; and as Abraham had the thing signified before he received circum∣cision, it was a seal to him of the faith he had; and at God's command he applied the sign of what was then future, to such as had not the thing signified wrought in them: but 'tis in vain for any to say. They stand to act for their children as Abraham did for his, unless they can prove that a <HI>national church</HI> is to spring from them, and that a Saviour is here∣after to come out of it. Baptism is not a type of a future crucifixion of the Saviour, but a token of that great event which is past, and that we <HI>are crucified with him,</HI> and HAVE <HI>put him on.</HI> Gal. 2.20. and 3.27. And to put this sign upon our children, unless we imagine with Origen, that BY it the inward change is wrought, is to do so much toward making our children hypocrites. The Westminster-catechism calls baptism, a sign of our <HI>engrafting into Christ,</HI> therefore to put this sign on any before we have some gospel evidence that they have been made <HI>dead to the law,</HI> what is it but <HI>adultery!</HI> Rom. 7.3.4.</NOTE> For
<PB N="138" REF="012655_0137_0F8BBEC3CB044060"/>as a full evidence for infant baptism, he from Mr. Bostwick, gives us Origen's words that <Q>It is because <HI>by</HI> the sacrament of baptism the <HI>pol∣lution of our birth is taken away,</HI> that infants are baptized.</Q> p. 44. Origen is the first man that any of them have ever been able to produce, who expressly appeared for infant bap∣tism, and his argument to support it is, because he says, BY it the <HI>pollution of our birth is taken away.</HI> But Tertullian in the same age opposed the practice, as our author owns, p. 45. And yet in p. 47, he would have his readers believe, that there was "No dispute about the point," for more than a thousand years after the apostles. And then to bind the whole he says, <Q>Infant baptism is valid, and agreeable to the institu∣tion
<PB N="139" REF="012655_0138_0F8BBEC48CFD5910"/>of Christ; or else there neither is nor CAN BE any regular baptism in the church, to the end of the world. p. 48.</Q> That is, If in times of antichristian darkness, they did <HI>change the or∣dinance,</HI> and the change did prevail so far that <HI>none uprightly and openly appeared</HI> against it,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isa. 24.5. Micah 7.2.</NOTE> then we can never reform and come right again! Whether a stronger argument than this against reformation, was ever brought out of the smoke of the pit or not, is left to the readers judg∣ment!</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>mystery of iniquity</HI> began to work in the apostles days, 2 Thes. 2.7. and had prevailed so far when infant baptism was introduced, as also to bring infants to the Lord's supper, as a <HI>saving ordinance:</HI> and likewise to use the sign of the cross, Godfathers, renouncing the devil and his works, exorcisms, dipping the head thrice in reference to the three persons in the Trinity, consecrating the water, anointing with oil, &amp;c. at baptism; for all which Dr. Gill has produced plain and <HI>express</HI> preofs, out of the same fathers that are quoted for infant baptism, and of as <HI>early</HI> date; and he observes, that the reasonings for in∣fant baptism that are used <Q>From the testimony of the antients, the <HI>difficulty</HI> of an innovation, and the <HI>easiness</HI> of its detection, may be applied to all and each of these rites. Wherefore, who∣ever receives infant baptism upon the foot of <HI>apostolic tradition,</HI> and upon such <HI>proof</HI> and <HI>evidence</HI> as is given of it, if he is an <HI>honest</HI> man; I say again, if he is an <HI>honest</HI> man, he ought to give into the practice of ALL these rites

<P>Dr. Owen tells us, that the protestants in their separation from the church of Rome, proceeded upon these <HI>general principles.</HI> <Q>1. That the word of God is a perfect rule of faith and religious worship. 2. That christian people were not tied up to blind obedience unto church guides, but were not only at liberty, but also obliged to judge for themselves, as unto all things that they were to believe and practise in reli∣gion and the worship of God. 3. That there was not any catholic, visible, organical govern∣ing church, traduced by <HI>succession</HI> into that of Rome, whence all power and order was to be <HI>derived.</HI>—They could acknowledge NO such church state in the Roman church, nor the derivation of ANY power and order from it. So far as there is a <HI>declersion</HI> from <HI>this principle,</HI> so far the cause of <HI>the reformation</HI> is weakned,
<PB N="141" REF="012655_0140_0F8BBEC676C28248"/>and the principal reason of <HI>separation</HI> from the Roman church is rejected.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Dr. Owen on the <HI>original of evangelical churches.</HI> p. 291, 294, 297.</NOTE></Q></P>
<P>From whence I leave the reader to judge, what cause we had for a new separation; and shall close the whole with observing, That denying the intire depravity of nature, and the absolute sove∣reignty of grace, and holding that the pro∣mises threof are connected with the desires and doings of natural men, and that their final state turns upon their well or ill improving their free-will power, and that a man may finally fall from grace received, are the dregs of popery, which since the reformation have been called Armini∣anism; while excluding, or disregarding the au∣thority of the divine law, is Antinomianism: both of which names the principle of beliver's baptism has often been reproached with; while yet we are constantly complained of because we will not be either Arminians or Antinomians, or both of them. For what is all the noise we hear, of our children's being in covenant, or else that if they die in infancy we can have no hope of them, without it be from the unco∣venanted (i. e. sovereign) mercy of God? And that (either by birth or by men's <HI>works</HI> in baptizing of them) they are in the <HI>covenant of grace</HI> and children of <HI>promise,</HI><NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Our author refers to several ancient promises, so God's people, of the pouring of his Spirit on their offspring, which he compares with Act 2.3., and says, <Q>The promise is the immediate privilege of believing parents, and their children, as it's expressed in the present time, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> may not be so divided as to be the immediate privilege of the believing parents, and the future privilege of their children when they shall believe.</Q> p. 30. But he has for∣got, that this promise in the present time was proclaimed, not to believing but guilty parents, who had said, <HI>His blood be on us, and on our children.</HI> Mat. 27.25. <HI>Then they that gladly received his word were baptized.</HI> And doubtless there were both parents and childeen that <HI>received the promise</HI> on that day; and in after days, those which the Lord added to his church, were <HI>such as should be saved.</HI> Acts. 2.41, 47. Com∣pare this with Peter's limitation of the <HI>promise</HI> to <HI>even as many as God shall call,</HI> and what warrant can we have from all this, to baptize any till we have some evidence that they are <HI>called</HI> so as to <HI>receive the promise of the Spirit,</HI> unless we will dare to add to God's word!</NOTE> till by their own
<PB N="142" REF="012655_0141_0F8BBEC701CA3C98"/>doings they <HI>fall</HI> therefrom: I say what is all this but the relicks of Arminianism? Yea, re∣licks absolutly inconsistent with the apostolic doc∣trine, of <HI>all</HI> being <HI>under sin,</HI> and <HI>under the curse,</HI> till they are <HI>delivered</HI> by Christ, and <HI>receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</HI> Rom. 3.9. Gal. 3.10, 13, 14. I believe God can and some∣times does sanctify infants from the womb: but evidence that they have faith is necessary before baptism.</P>
<P>On the other hand, our apponents hold it to be the law of Christ, that all believers should bap∣tize their children, and yet will call those <HI>regular</HI> baptists, who will join in their churches, without bringing their infants, or acting in the baptism themselves, as they believe the law of Christ di∣rects. And though our opponents hold with us, that it is the law of Christ, that all should be baptized before they come to the Lord's table; yet many of them accuse us of rigidness, of un∣churching all but ourselves, &amp;c. only because we
<PB N="143" REF="012655_0142_0F8BBECC1DC07098"/>will not meet such persons there, as we cannot believe in our conscience to be baptized accord∣ing to our Lord's direction. If any on our side are found to use any deceit or violence to∣ward the other denomination, or any method con∣trary to speaking the truth in love, let them be corrected or punished according to the demerit of their crime; but if the truth breaks up chur∣ches, it highly concerns all that belong to them, to awake and consider what churches they are. We have two sorts of separation described in holy writ: One is produced by an exalting of self above others; the other by such an adherence to divine rule as to part with those who will not conform to it. Isa. 65.5. Psalm 119.115. And unless our pedobaptist fathers and brethren can convince us that HE who was <HI>faithful</HI> in his house, and worthy of more glory than Moses, has yet left things at such loose ends, as only to ap∣point the use of water in the sacred name, with∣out determining whether it should be by sprinkling, pouring or burying, but has left that to be determined by men's consciences: I say till they can convince us of this, all their noise about the evil of re-baptising and close communion, cannot satisfy our minds, that we can duly regard the law of Christ, if we come to his table with any who have not been <HI>buried with him in bap∣tism.</HI></P>
<P>I am sensible that this author, after owning that in scripture we <Q>Have <HI>no express</HI> account about the baptizing of the infant seed of be∣lievers:</Q> p. 32. yet tells us of <Q>straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel,</Q> because we will
<PB N="144" REF="012655_0143_0F8BBECEAEB44C80"/>not admit that practice upon the covenant of cir∣cumcision. p. 33. But as 'tis evident to us, that men have <HI>changed the ordinance,</HI> from burying to sprinkling; and, from those who are taught and believe, to applying it to subjects before they are capable of being taught, without any divine warrant at all; let this change be called a gnat or a camel, or what else they please, yet I trust it will ever appear too big to be swallowed, by those who duly attend to the orders of our great Lord and Master, which are; <Q>Go ye and <HI>teach</HI> all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost; teaching them to OBSERVE ALL THINGS, WHATSOEVER I HAVE COMMANDED you; and lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world. AMEN.</Q></P>

<P><HI>N. B.</HI> Where (Ex. with figures added thereto occurs) it refers to pages in my examination of Mr. <HI>Joseph Fish</HI>'s nine sermons, where the same points as here are treated of.</P>
<P>A Reply to Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> under these heads. 1. Of the ma∣terials of Christ's visible church; which are proved to be only professing believers: and his arguments for infant∣baptism are distinctly answered. p. 4—17. (Ex. p. 12, 13, 97—129.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of the manner of building churches. Christ has insti∣tuted none but particular churches, which are tobe built up by persons giving a verbal account of a work of God's Spirit on their souls, to the church, in order to their being received as members. p. 17—23. (Ex. p. 17—19, 31, 49, 50. Testimonies to confirm this, from Dr. Owen, p. 18, 58—60. Capt. Clap, p. 54. Mr. Eliot, p. 55. Mr. Shepard, p. 57, 95. Mr. Mitchel, p. 19, 51, 56. Dr. Mather, p. 17—19.)</P>
<P N="3">3. Of organizing churches. The power both of appro∣bating and ordaining ministers proved to be in the churches, and none have a right to act therein only as they are ap∣pointed thereto by the church. p. 23—33. (Ex. p. 16, 24, 40, 41, 60—63. This confirmed by the example of our fathers, p. 16, 52. and by Dr. Owen, p. 64, 69, 70.)</P>
<P N="4">4. Of the difference between civil and ecclesiastical go∣vernment. p. 33—51. (Ex. p. 20—32.)</P>
<P>The gospel method of supporting ministers opened, and the evils of using force in the case described. p. 35, &amp;c. (Ex. p. 20, 24—27, 29, 30, 46—48, 74—82.)</P>
<P N="5">5. Of separation; the cause and nature of our's. p. 51.</P>
<P N="1">1. It was because church and world were confounded toge∣ther. p. 52—56. (Ex. p. 20, 50, 51, 94. This confirm∣ed by Dr. I. Mather, p. 19. Dr. Cotton Mather, p. 37. Mr. Mitchel, p. 51. Dr. Owen. p. 85—88.)</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="146" REF="012655_0145_0F8BBECFD52B01A0"/>
2. Because human learning was put in the place of the gifts of the Spirit, to qualify ministers. p. 56—59. (Ex. p. 41—45. This confirmed by Mr. Tennant, p. 33. Mr. Edwards, p. 34, 68. Mr. Prince, p. 52. Dr. Frank, p. 53. Mr. Porter, p. 68, 69. Dr. Owen, p. 86.)</P>
<P N="3">3. Because gospel liberty in such affairs was denied. p. 59—66. (Ex. p. 38—41, 46—48, 50—53. This con∣firmed from Mr. Tennant, p. 34. Mr. Edwards, p. 34. Dr. Owen, p. 83, 86, 88. Dr. Frank, p. 84, 90.)</P>
<P N="4">4. Because unwarranted ways of worship were practised among us. p. 66. (Ex. p. 72, 102, &amp;c.)</P>
<P N="5">5. Because gospel discipline was neglected and changed into a worldly dominion. p. 67. (Ex. p. 20, 28—31, 51. Dr. Owen upon it. p. 85—87.)</P>
<P N="6">6. Because of minister's setting up themselves, and instead of preaching to edisication, treating those who would not submit to them with a great deal of abuse. p. 67, &amp;c. (Ex. p. 35, 84, 90, 91, 94.)</P>
<P>An address to Mr. <HI>Joseph Fish,</HI>—giving the reasons for my writing, p. 79. And shewing to him that he has in his arguments to support the standing churches, been guilty,</P>
<P N="1">1. Of setting <HI>themselves</HI> up as a standard instead of divine truth, p. 83.</P>
<P N="2">2. Of using scripture words without duly regarding their meaning, p. 87.</P>
<P N="3">3. Of blending truth and error together in many instances, in order to gain his argument, p. 91.</P>
<P N="4">4. Of violating the golden rule so much as to endeavor to draw their own character only by their virtues or good pretences; and that of their opponents only by their imper∣fections, p. 99.</P>
<P>Our fathers like conduct will condemn, and not excuse him herein, p. 101.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Fish</HI> in these proceedings has grossly misrepresented several facts, p. 116.</P>
<P>And has shewn a wrong temper: so that according to his own concessions he is guilty both of sophistry and slander, p. 126.</P>
<P>APPENDIX, shewing that the advocates for infant-bap∣tism proceed in an obscure and unsteady use of words, which carries them away into additions to God's word, and a denial of what is therein; also to abuse their neighbours, and countenance popery, Arminianism and Antinomianism.</P>

HAVING thus summed up the matter in short terms, the author has one earnest request to make to all his readers; and that is, That they would always be careful to distinguish between the characters of men and the truth of God. He desires to be far from setting himself up in com∣parison, much less in competition, with many great and good men, who have practised in∣fant baptism, and other things which he op∣poses. If those practices cannot be vindicated from divine truth, the characters of men can't do it, but only serve to perplex and keep souls in bondage. The goodness of David's character could never make that proceeding of his to be right, which he was moved to by <HI>satan;</HI> neither could the badness of Joab's character, make it wrong for him to look upon that conduct to be <HI>abominable.</HI> 1 Chron. 21.1, 6. <HI>Dissimulation</HI> was no better in Peter than it was in Judas; therefore Paul called it by it's proper name, to prevent others being ensnared thereby. Gal. 2. 13. Yet as one or two actions do not ordinari∣ly form a man's character, David is far from having the character of satan's servant, or Peter from having that of a hypocrite or a traitor. So let all take notice, that what I mean to appear against, is the particular evils that I have named, and not against the characters, or any of the vir∣tues of those who have been ensnared by them. Hence there is no need for any to take pains to prove that learned men, or good men have hold those things; for that is not disputed. The turn∣ing points of our whole dispute may be reduced to these four questions.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="148" REF="012655_0147_0F8BBED148AA79B0"/>
1. Whether Abraham's believing, and being justified by the <HI>covenant of grace in Christ before</HI> he took the <HI>bond-woman,</HI> can give us warrant to confound that <HI>grace</HI> with the covenant of circum∣cision (which included the children both of the <HI>bond-woman</HI> and the <HI>free</HI>) so as to bring the chil∣dren of our <HI>flesh</HI> to baptism, before we have any gospel evidence that they are <HI>made free in Jesus Christ?</HI> Gal. 3.17, and 4.22—31.</P>
<P N="2">2. Since the chief advantage that the Jews had by the covenant of circumcision was, that unto them were committed the <HI>oracles of God;</HI> which were so much limited to them, that be∣fore Christ by his death had taken that covenant out of the way, his apostles might not preach to any but to them who were in it. Rom. 3.2. Mat. 10.5.6. Is it not an absolute falshood, for any to assert, that the covenant is the same with our children, as it was with theirs? and since our children have the means for conversion used with them, in so much clearer light, than theirs had under the law; what an abuse is it to accuse us with lessening our children's privileges, only because we dare not put the outward sign of regeneration upon them, before we have evidence that the inward change is wrought?</P>
<P N="3">3. Though the primitive churches employ∣ed elders in ordaining others over them, which doubtless is an example for us to follow; yet how can that prove, that the conferring of office-power is inherent in officers, and not in the church as a body, since Christ expressly warned his disci∣ples, against having any such superiority among them as there is in civil <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, saying, <HI>He that
<PB N="149" REF="012655_0148_0F8BBED208AB6BE0"/>is greatest among you let him be as the younger:</HI> and the apostles were but the churches <HI>servants for Jesus sake?</HI> Luke. 22.26.2 Cor. 4.5.</P>
<P N="4">4. Since in the Jewish church, where a cer∣tain part or proportion of the peoples income, was by express command to be given to the ministers of the sanctuary, while yet neither precept nor precedent can be found for rulers using any <HI>force</HI> to collect it; what warrant can any earthly power have now, to assess any persons, and use force to collect the same, for the support of any religious worship whatsoever?<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The reader will not wonder that such care is taken to have this question truly stated, when he is informed, that since these sheets were in the press, the author has seen a discourse that bears so sine a title as this; <Q>Catholicism: or, christian charity,</Q> published at the particular request of a <HI>convention</HI> of those called standing ministers at Bristol, on <HI>May</HI> 20, 1772, in which the writer mentions our separa∣tion, which he calls a sect well known, and says, <Q>It is worthy of notice, that many of the leaders of that unhap∣py schism, who were for pulling down ministers, and rip∣ping up churches in their great zeal (rather fury) for sup∣posed heresy, particularly in the article of giving and re∣ceiving ministerial support; I say many of those very persons are as fond of support from their people, as those they once anathematized. The consistency and honesty of such a temper and conduct is far beyond me to recon∣cile, and is, I apprehend, as irreconcilable as light and darkness.</Q> p. 38. Thus their charity prompts them to represent us, as not only inconsistent, but also <HI>dishonest;</HI> and the way they take to do it, is by insinuating that our contro∣versy with them was about <HI>giving</HI> and <HI>receiving;</HI> whereas the truth is, it was about <HI>assessing</HI> and <HI>forcing;</HI> and they are welcome to produce one instance if they can of any such in∣consistency and dishonesty as they here speak of, unless it be in two or three teachers who have deserted the cause that they once professed to be in, in order to get into fellowship with these ministers. And since they have given this pam∣phlet the name of <HI>charity,</HI> I would just remark that they say, <Q>There is doubtless a sort of natural, as well as christian charity. The source of this kind of charity is self; here it begins and ends.</Q> p. 25. and they say, <Q>Liberty and candor are the great basis of human happiness: we often hear persons extolling the advantages of both, who yet seem to be really acquainted with neither. For if they have any design on foot, if you entertain different views, and with freedom speak your mind, you are instantly deemed an enemy, and you must be treated as such, so that if you escape without the sword, it is not so much owing to a generous spirit of liberty, as a want of power.</Q> p. 65.</NOTE></P>
<P>Now the reader may form some judgment of what sort of persons they are, who extol liberty, charity and a catholic temper, while their own charity begins and ends in <HI>self,</HI> by the two following notes. Speaking of our separation the writer says, <Q>Such uncharitable principles have led them to exclude themselves from the communion of THE ca∣tholic church.</Q> p. 38. And speaking of occasionally in∣viting ministers to preach he says, <Q>I cannot see the pro∣priety nor the expediency of inviting the assistance of ANY man, be his profession what it may, that denies ME the rights and privileges of the church of Christ. If we cant eat and drink of one bread and one cup, in token of mu∣tual fellowship; I see no reason why I should encourage such persons in their <HI>uncharitableness,</HI> since charity is the great criterion of real christianity.</Q> p. 65.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="012655_0149_0F8BBED31CA21FB8"/>
If any can fairly answer these questions; or can shew that this is not the true state of our contro∣versy, they will do something to the purpose: but to neglect this and fill up volume after volume with other things, evidently tends to confusion and not to peace. And if any with Abner, chuse now to call it <HI>play;</HI> they like him, will surely find it to be <HI>bitterness in the latter end.</HI> 2 Sam. 2.14, 26.</P>
