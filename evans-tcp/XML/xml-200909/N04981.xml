<P>And walk in Love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice to God, for a sweet-smelling Savour.</P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>THAT <HI>Man</HI> is design'd for <HI>Society,</HI> ap∣pears from the original <HI>Constitution</HI> of the human <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>WE need and desire each others <HI>As∣sistance</HI> for mutual <HI>Support, Comfort</HI> and <HI>Protec∣tion;</HI> and have a <HI>Disposition</HI> to communicate our <HI>Ideas</HI> to those of our own <HI>Species,</HI> as well as <HI>Acts</HI> of <HI>Kindness</HI> and <HI>Beneficence.</HI> These <HI>Desires</HI> and <HI>Dispositions</HI> being <HI>common</HI> and mutual, shew that we are born for <HI>Society.</HI></P>
<P>OF this, mutual <HI>Love</HI> is the <HI>Band</HI> and <HI>Cement;</HI> which, unless it be preserv'd and express'd, <HI>Soci∣ety</HI> becomes a <HI>Snare</HI> and <HI>Torment,</HI> and cannot comfortably or profitably subsist, yea, hardly sub∣sist at all, for any long Duration: For Men, by the Neglect of its Exercise, and much more by its Contrary, will be tempted, against the <HI>Law</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI> to seek a <HI>single</HI> and independent State, in order to secure their <HI>Ease</HI> and <HI>Safety.</HI></P>
<P>AND as <HI>Love</HI> is agreeable to the Law of <HI>Na∣ture,</HI> and the original <HI>Dispositions</HI> of the <HI>Minds</HI> of <HI>Men;</HI> so, of consequence, it cannot but agree with the <HI>Moral Law,</HI> the unalterable <HI>Rule</HI> of our <HI>Practice,</HI> and the <HI>Divine Nature,</HI> which is its <HI>Prototype,</HI> or original <HI>Copy</HI> and <HI>Exemplar.</HI> Hence
<PB N="4" REF="006243_0004_10281D7654AE6B18"/>
we are inform'd by the Apostle <HI>John,</HI> that <HI>God</HI> is <HI>Love; i. e.</HI> inclin'd to vouchsafe upon his <HI>Crea∣tures,</HI> Acts of <HI>Kindness</HI> and <HI>Benignity,</HI> and does not inflict <HI>Penalties,</HI> till they be as it were extort∣ed by the <HI>criminal Conduct</HI> of his <HI>Creatures.</HI> Hence <HI>Judgment</HI> is represented as <HI>his strange Work;</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> his <HI>Delight.</HI></P>
<P>NOR are we only obliged to <HI>love</HI> by the com∣mon <HI>Ties</HI> of <HI>Humanity,</HI> as we are <HI>Men;</HI> but likewise by the <HI>Laws</HI> of Christianity, as we are <HI>Brethren</HI> (at least by Profession) <HI>Children</HI> of the same <HI>Father, Members</HI> of the same religious <HI>Com∣munity</HI> (or Body mystical) <HI>Heirs</HI> of the same <HI>Hope,</HI> and <HI>Expectants</HI> of the same <HI>Inheritance.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the most powerful <HI>Incentive</HI> to the <HI>Love</HI> of our <HI>Brethren,</HI> is the glorious <HI>Example</HI> of the <HI>Redeemer's Love to us,</HI> which the Apostle beauti∣fully represents in the Words of our Text, <HI>And walk in Love, as Christ also hath loved us, and hath given himself for us an Offering, and a Sa∣crifice to God for a sweet-smelling Savour.</HI></P>
<P>IN these Words we may observe an important <HI>Duty</HI> enjoin'd, <HI>Walk in Love;</HI> and a powerful <HI>Motive</HI> exciting thereto <HI>propos'd, viz.</HI> The <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> to us; express'd in the <HI>Giving of himself for us, an Offering and a Sacrifice of a sweet-smelling Savour to God.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to prepare this <HI>Subject</HI> for Improve∣ment, it is necessary to open and explain the afore∣said Particulars:</P>
<P>AS to the <HI>Duty</HI> enjoin'd, let us enquire what is imply'd in <HI>Walking in Love</HI> to our Neighbour? I answer, it implies our <HI>Esteem</HI> of him, for what∣ever is <HI>excellent</HI> in him, either <HI>natural, acquired,</HI> or <HI>gracious.</HI> The All-wise <HI>God</HI> has dispensed his
<PB N="5" REF="006243_0005_10281D796559EF78"/>
<HI>Gifts</HI> variously upon the Children of Men; and that with this <HI>Design,</HI> that universal <HI>Love</HI> to our Fellow-Creatures might take place. There is none whom we converse with for some Time, but we may perceive something <HI>amiable</HI> in them, which deserves our <HI>Esteem</HI> and <HI>Respect.</HI> O! if Mankind were as quick in Spying one another's <HI>Excellencies,</HI> as they are each other's <HI>Faults,</HI> how candid and noble wou'd it be? And how much wou'd it promote universal <HI>Love</HI> and <HI>Benevolence!</HI> But alas! the contrary <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Practice</HI> too much prevails generally. If our Neighbour has not <HI>saving Grace,</HI> which is, no doubt, the <HI>Ground</HI> of our <HI>special Respect</HI> and Complacence, perhaps he has some <HI>moral Excellency;</HI> if not, he has at least an <HI>immortal Soul,</HI> which, in respect of its <HI>Nature,</HI> may be said to bear the natural <HI>Image</HI> of <HI>God:</HI> But <HI>Love</HI> to our <HI>Brother</HI> does not only im∣ply our <HI>Esteem</HI> of him, but our <HI>hearty Desire</HI> after his <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Benefit</HI> in the most extensive Sense; as well as our <HI>Complacence</HI> therein, and <HI>Grief</HI> for the contrary.</P>
<P>AND this <HI>Love</HI> will doubtless manifest itself in kind and <HI>courteous Speech;</HI> and, where <HI>Necessity</HI> requires, and <HI>Ability</HI> admits, in <HI>beneficent Action.</HI></P>
<P>BUT more particularly, that <HI>special Love</HI> to <HI>pious People,</HI> which the <HI>Apostle</HI> had chiefly in <HI>View</HI> in our <HI>Text,</HI> and which is propos'd by the <HI>Apostle John,</HI> as a <HI>Mark</HI> of true <HI>Christianity,</HI> has the following <HI>Properties:</HI></P>
<P>IT is <HI>sincere,</HI> chiefly for their Goodness and Holiness:—</P>
<P>IT is <HI>universal,</HI> extending to all that we have reason to think are <HI>pious,</HI> from their <HI>Soundness</HI> in the <HI>main Principles</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> their regular <HI>Be∣haviour</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="006243_0006_10281D7B08495298"/>
and <HI>Acquaintance</HI> with experimental <HI>Chri∣stianity.</HI> If our <HI>Love</HI> be confin'd to those only who are of our <HI>Way of Thinking</HI> in every <HI>minute Point,</HI> it is not true <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>Brethren,</HI> but the selfish <HI>Love</HI> of a <HI>Party</HI> or <HI>Faction.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER: <HI>Brotherly Love</HI> is <HI>proportional,</HI> suited to the different <HI>Degrees</HI> of spiritual <HI>Good</HI> we apprehend to be in others. Such as we conceive to be more <HI>holy</HI> than others, we <HI>love</HI> them more in <HI>Degree.</HI></P>
<P>IT is likewise <HI>effectual;</HI> not consisting <HI>in Word, and in Tongue only, but in Deed, and in Truth.</HI></P>
<P>NOW to <HI>walk in Love,</HI> implies a <HI>Course</HI> of <HI>Kind∣ness</HI> to our <HI>Brethren,</HI> in <HI>Disposition, Speech</HI> and <HI>Action;</HI> as well as our taking <HI>Pains</HI> to this End. We mustn't only <HI>begin</HI> to <HI>love</HI> them, but we should make <HI>Progress</HI> therein, and <HI>continue</HI> to the <HI>End.</HI> And truly this cannot be done without <HI>Pains:</HI> For as our <HI>Faith</HI> is <HI>try'd</HI> variously, so is our <HI>Love;</HI> and indeed it is proper it should be so: For this <HI>Life</HI> is altogether a <HI>State</HI> of <HI>Trial</HI> and <HI>Probation,</HI> in order to another <HI>State</HI> after <HI>Death.</HI> Now there are three Sorts of <HI>Trials</HI> that the <HI>All∣wise God</HI> is pleased sometimes to suffer to come in the Way of our <HI>Love, viz. Spiritual Deser∣tion, Offences</HI> in <HI>Conduct,</HI> and <HI>Difference</HI> in <HI>Senti∣ment,</HI> about the <HI>circumstantial Points</HI> of <HI>Religion.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN a Child of God is long deserted, his <HI>Savour</HI> of <HI>Religion</HI> does of consequence decline. This must needs affect, in some Degree, his <HI>Con∣versation,</HI> and make it more <HI>unsavoury,</HI> and <HI>less edifying:</HI> He is, in this Situation, like a <HI>Tree</HI> in <HI>Winter,</HI> which, tho' it has <HI>Life</HI> at the <HI>Root,</HI> ap∣pears, because of its Want of <HI>Leaves</HI> and <HI>Verdure,</HI> as tho' it were quite <HI>dry</HI> and <HI>dead.</HI> Now, a <HI>Be∣ginner</HI>
<PB N="7" REF="006243_0007_10281D7CAF46FB48"/>
in <HI>Christianity,</HI> who has much Joy and Comfort, and is fir'd with his first <HI>Love,</HI> not having been try'd with <HI>Storms</HI> and <HI>Tempests,</HI> and being, on that Account, comparatively unacquaint∣ed with the <HI>Devices</HI> of <HI>Satan,</HI> the <HI>Depths</HI> of his own <HI>Corruption</HI> and <HI>Weakness,</HI> is apt to look upon poor deserted Creatures with some Degree of <HI>Contempt,</HI> and censure them severely; and, per∣haps, to judge that they have no Good in them, because they <HI>have lost their first Love, and fallen from their first Works,</HI> in some Measure. But this is exceeding <HI>cruel</HI> and <HI>barbarous!</HI> Very dis∣pleasing to <HI>God,</HI> and hurtful to Society! And such who are guilty of this Severity, if they will not, by <HI>gentle Measures,</HI> be brought to a merciful <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Behaviour,</HI> they must learn its Ne∣cessity and Excellency by <HI>broken Bones,</HI> by their own Falls and Blunders; they must come down from their <HI>Pinacle</HI> of spiritual <HI>Pride</HI> one Way or other. O Sirs! let us <HI>be merciful, as our heaven∣ly Father is merciful.</HI></P>
<P>BUT another <HI>Trial</HI> of our <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>Bre∣thren,</HI> is <HI>Offences</HI> committed against us by them. We are all imperfect Creatures, and <HI>in many Things offend all;</HI> and therefore need each others <HI>For∣bearance</HI> and <HI>Charity.—Grace</HI> is in the best, like <HI>Gold</HI> in the <HI>Ore,</HI> attended with Weaknesses and <HI>Defects.</HI> Now <HI>Satan,</HI> who is the <HI>Accuser of the Brethren,</HI> in Case of <HI>Offence,</HI> excites us to impute it to <HI>bad Design;</HI> which much aggravates the <HI>Matter,</HI> and so tends to inflame our <HI>Resentments,</HI> and widen the <HI>Breach.</HI> In Opposition hereto, it is a necessary, tho' difficult Duty, <HI>To hope all Things, and believe all Things</HI> that are Good of our poor <HI>Brother;</HI> to impute his <HI>Offence</HI> to <HI>inad∣vertency</HI>
<PB N="8" REF="006243_0008_10281D81B6A9C258"/>
or <HI>Mistake,</HI> or some violent <HI>Temptation,</HI> and not to malicious Intention. This Method has a noble Tendency to soften Offences, and to conciliate <HI>Peace.</HI> And this Treatment we expect and desire from others, and think we are wrong'd when we get it not; and therefore we should render it to others. <HI>If our Brother offends, not only seven Times, but seventy Times seven, when he repents, we should forgive him; and walk in Love, as Christ also hath loved us.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER: Another Way by which our <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>Brethren</HI> is try'd, is <HI>Differences</HI> of <HI>Opinion</HI> in the smaller Points of <HI>Religion.</HI> This often oc∣casions great Uneasiness, Heart-burnings and Di∣stance, tho' very unreasonably. We should allow to another the same <HI>Liberty</HI> we take ourselves, and consider that <HI>Men</HI> can't alter their <HI>Opinions,</HI> or retain them according to their <HI>Neighbours Pleasure;</HI> but must think and believe as Things appear to them from Time to Time. Seeing that every Man has an equal Right to think for him∣self; and seeing that <HI>Methods</HI> of <HI>Force</HI> can't alter the <HI>Sentiments</HI> of the Mind, it is therefore un∣reasonable and unjust; yea some Degree of <HI>Per∣secution</HI> to be <HI>offended</HI> with our <HI>Brother,</HI> because he doesn't think as we do in every Thing. And inasmuch as our <HI>Knowledge</HI> is imperfect, as well as our <HI>Graces;</HI> and we are bid to <HI>grow in Know∣ledge,</HI> as well as in <HI>Grace;</HI> we may, by the Increase of Light, be oblig'd to change our <HI>Sentiments</HI> in some <HI>circumstantial Points,</HI> and to need others <HI>Charity</HI> and <HI>Forbearance</HI> towards us: And why then shou'd we not express it towards them? In the <HI>apostolick Times</HI> there was a Difference of <HI>O∣pinion</HI> between the <HI>Jewish</HI> and <HI>Gentile Christians</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="006243_0009_10281D833968D2B8"/>
about <HI>Days</HI> and <HI>Meats;</HI> the <HI>Jewish Christians</HI> re∣taining a Tincture of their Manner of <HI>Education,</HI> tho't it was still necessary, even in <HI>Gospel Times,</HI> to observe the <HI>ceremonial Sabboo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hs</HI> of the <HI>Jewish Church,</HI> as well as the Difference of <HI>Meats</HI> en∣joined by the <HI>ceremonial Law;</HI> and were tempt∣ed to look upon the <HI>Gentile Christians</HI> as lax and <HI>prophane,</HI> who made no <HI>Conscience</HI> of such Obser∣vances.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, the <HI>Gentile Christians,</HI> not being educated in their <HI>Way,</HI> and better un∣derstanding the Extent of <HI>Christian Liberty,</HI> wou'd not be bro't into <HI>Bondage</HI> by them; but their <HI>Tempers</HI> being over-heated by <HI>Debate,</HI> toge∣ther with the <HI>Temptations</HI> of the <HI>Enemy,</HI> they were inclin'd, not only to censure them as <HI>super∣stitious,</HI> with an <HI>Air</HI> of <HI>Resentment,</HI> but to con∣demn their <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Design;</HI> in a Word, the <HI>Ferment</HI> of <HI>Contention</HI> rose to such a Height, a∣bout the aforesaid <HI>circumstantial Matters,</HI> that each <HI>Party</HI> were ready to un-church the other: Between them the <HI>Apostle Paul</HI> acts as a <HI>Modera∣tor</HI> and <HI>Peace-maker,</HI> in the fourteenth Chapter of his Epistle to the <HI>Romans;</HI> and labours to as∣swage the <HI>angry Flame,</HI> by proper <HI>Lenitives;</HI> he advises the strong <HI>Gentile,</HI> to receive the <HI>weak Jew</HI> to Communion, or Church-Fellowship, tho' in some circumstantial <HI>Errors;</HI> and not trou∣ble and plague him with <HI>doubtful Disputations,</HI> or <HI>Debates</HI> about lesser Things, which are com∣paratively doubtful. There is indeed a Promise <HI>that the Anointing which</HI> pious People <HI>receive, shall lead them into all Truth; i. e.</HI> into all <HI>Fundamental Truth;</HI> all that <HI>Truth</HI> which is of absolute Necessity to <HI>Salvation;</HI> to ex∣tend
<PB N="10" REF="006243_0010_10281D88287DD458"/>
the <HI>Promise</HI> farther, will confine the true <HI>Church</HI> of Christ to one <HI>Fold,</HI> to one <HI>Pale,</HI> and perhaps to a small Number in that, which is ve∣ry unreasonable and uncharitable. There are but a very few of the Children of Men, who are in all minute <HI>Points</HI> of the same <HI>Mind;</HI> and seeing the <HI>Promise</HI> of the <HI>Spirit,</HI> does not extend abso∣lutely to every <HI>Circumstantial</HI> in <HI>Religion,</HI> other∣wise all that are truly <HI>Pious,</HI> wou'd be unanimous in them; which certainly is not the Case; then it will follow, that the proper <HI>Foundation</HI> of our Cer∣tainty or <HI>Perswasion</HI> is not <HI>infallible;</HI> and therefore however unreasonably <HI>confident</HI> Persons are, on both Sides of the <HI>Question,</HI> as generally indeed there is too much of this; yet these Things may be truly call'd, at least comparatively, <HI>doubtful Disputa∣tions.</HI> A modest <HI>Diffidence</HI> of our own <HI>Judgment,</HI> as to those <HI>Matters,</HI> so far as to entertain honour∣able <HI>Sentiments</HI> of such as are otherwise minded, is an amiable <HI>Character:</HI> It is an Argument of a weak Mind, to raise a <HI>Superstructure</HI> disproporti∣on'd to the <HI>Foundation;</HI> on the contrary, it is an Instance of true <HI>Wisdom</HI> to have our <HI>Persuasion</HI> suited in <HI>Degree</HI> to the <HI>Grounds</HI> on which it is built, and the <HI>Degree</HI> of our <HI>Zeal</HI> proportioned to the Weight and Importance of the Things we are zealous about: <HI>Foundation Truths</HI> should be earnestly contended for, as well as <HI>experimental</HI> and <HI>practical Religion,</HI> and <HI>Holiness:</HI> But as to <HI>Circumstantials,</HI> we should be <HI>moderate</HI> and mer∣ciful, else instead of doing <HI>Good</HI> with our <HI>Zeal</HI> devoid of <HI>Temper</HI> and <HI>Knowledge,</HI> we shall do much <HI>Hurt,</HI> and imitate the pernicious <HI>Practice</HI> of the <HI>Pharisees</HI> of old, who were very warm <HI>a∣bout
<PB N="11" REF="006243_0011_10281D8B74B97790"/>
tything Mint, and Annis, and Cummin,</HI> but in the mean Time <HI>neglected the weightier Matters of the Law</HI> <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mat. xxiii. 23.</HI> Kai aphecate, ta barutera tou nomou.</NOTE>. But to proceed,</P>
<P>THE <HI>Apostle Paul</HI> advises the contending <HI>Jew∣ish</HI> and <HI>Gentile Christians,</HI> in the aforesaid Chap∣ter, to abstain from despising of and judging one another, on Account of <HI>smaller Differences</HI> in <HI>O∣pinion.</HI> To this End he observes, that Persons were equally <HI>sincere</HI> and upright on each Side of the <HI>Question; He that regardeth a Day, regard∣eth it to the Lord; and he that regardeth not the Day to the Lord, he doth not regard it:</HI> He like∣wise observes, That the Consideration of all be∣ing to be judged by the great <HI>God</HI> at last, shou'd incline them to avoid <HI>rash judging</HI> of each o∣ther.</P>
<P>ANOTHER Argument that the Apostle uses to excite them to <HI>Peace</HI> and mutual <HI>Love,</HI> is this, That the <HI>Substance</HI> or <HI>Life</HI> of <HI>Religion,</HI> did not consist in those Things about which they contend∣ed; <HI>The Kingdom of God,</HI> saith he, <HI>is not Meat and Drink, but Righteousness and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghost; he that in these Things serveth Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved of Men. Almighty God,</HI> for wise <HI>Purposes,</HI> suffers his Peo∣ple to be of different <HI>Sentiments</HI> about <HI>smaller Points</HI> in <HI>Religion;</HI> and particularly for this, that the <HI>Truth</HI> of their <HI>Love</HI> may be brought to the <HI>Test.</HI> To have regard to those only that are of our Way of thinking in <HI>Circumstantials,</HI> while more valu∣able Persons, who agree with us in the Main, are <HI>slighted,</HI> because they differ in <HI>lesser Things;</HI> it is an Argument of a <HI>party, factious, selfish Love:</HI>
<PB N="12" REF="006243_0012_10281D8CF67AB760"/>
But true <HI>Love</HI> to the <HI>Brethren,</HI> extends to all those that we have Reason to hope, from their <HI>Sound∣ness</HI> in <HI>Foundation-Principles,</HI> Acquaintance with <HI>experimental Religion</HI> and <HI>practical Holiness,</HI> bear the <HI>moral Image</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> whether they be of our <HI>Denomination</HI> or not: We shou'd <HI>bear</HI> with one another's supposed or real <HI>Weaknesses</HI> in <HI>Prin∣ciple,</HI> as well as <HI>Practice,</HI> and, notwithstanding, <HI>love</HI> one another; Mens different <HI>Capacities,</HI> dif∣ferent <HI>Ways</HI> of <HI>Education,</HI> the different <HI>Books</HI> they read, the different <HI>Company</HI> they keep, lead them to different Ways of thinking: Add to this, that sometimes <HI>Credit</HI> and <HI>Interest</HI> give a secret and insensible <HI>Byas</HI> to the <HI>Mind.</HI></P>
<P>IT is a singular <HI>Mercy</HI> and great <HI>Comfort,</HI> when Persons are agreed in the most important Points; <HI>Whereto we have already attained, let us walk by the same Rule; let us mind the same Thing; and if in any Thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even this unto you.</HI> 'Tis easy and natural to love those that are of our Way of Thinking in <HI>every Thing,</HI> and that do not offend us: But when the contrary of these happens, then it is difficult. Hence it may safely be asserted, as a general and just <HI>Maxim,</HI> that the more <HI>Tryals</HI> our <HI>Love</HI> meets with, and yet it stands them, and proves <HI>Victori∣ous,</HI> the more <HI>Evidence</HI> it has of its being of a Divine <HI>Original;</HI> of its being that <HI>Love</HI> of the <HI>Brethren,</HI> which ascertains our Translation from <HI>Death</HI> to <HI>Life.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I proceed to speak of the MOTIVE excit∣ing to the Duty aforesaid, <HI>viz.</HI> The LOVE of CHRIST to his People; <HI>As Christ also hath loved us, and given himself for us.</HI>—</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="006243_0013_10281D9197AE8BB8"/>HERE let me speak of the <HI>Nature, Properties</HI> and <HI>Manifestations,</HI> of CHRIST'S LOVE to his <HI>Peo∣ple.</HI></P>
<P>AS to the general <HI>Nature</HI> of <HI>Love,</HI> I think it is commonly represented to be, <HI>Affectus Unionis;</HI> a Desire of Union with, or Nearness to the <HI>belo∣ved Object;</HI> and it is Two-fold, namely, of <HI>Bene∣volence</HI> and <HI>Complacency.</HI> The former signifies God's kind <HI>Intention</HI> of conferring <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>special Benefits</HI> upon his People in <HI>Time.</HI> In this Sense, no doubt, the <HI>Lord Jesus</HI> lov'd them before the <HI>Foundations of the Earth were laid;</HI> but the latter signifies the Delight he takes in his own <HI>Image</HI> conferr'd actually on those that fear him, in <HI>Time,</HI> and the Application of his <HI>Righteous∣ness</HI> to them thro' <HI>Faith.</HI> Hence are these Ex∣pressions in the Song of <HI>Solomon, Thou art all fair, my Love, there is no Spot in thee; thou hast ravished my Heart, my Sister, my Spouse, with one Chain of thy Neck.</HI> These Expressions seem to represent the Agreeableness of the Divine <HI>Image</HI> in his People, to the Divine <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Will;</HI> as well as the Necessity of a Change in Mens <HI>State</HI> and <HI>Frame</HI> in order to <HI>Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>WE should carefully observe, that such a Love as is in us, must not be ascrib'd to <HI>Christ,</HI> as he is <HI>God;</HI> for ours is <HI>passionate</HI> and <HI>imperfect,</HI> causing a Commotion in our Blood and Spirits; whereas his <HI>Love,</HI> as <HI>God,</HI> is a most pure and eternal <HI>Act</HI> of his <HI>Will,</HI> whereby he wills <HI>Good</HI> to us: Yet a <HI>human Love</HI> may be properly ascrib'd to him, as Man, but with great Pre-eminence to ours: As <HI>Man,</HI> he has a <HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Body, Will</HI> and <HI>Affections, Blood</HI> and <HI>animal Spirits,</HI> as we, but perfectly pure;
<PB N="14" REF="006243_0014_10281D951B465C60"/>
his Love is without <HI>Excess</HI> in its <HI>Tendencies,</HI> and without <HI>Tumult</HI> in its <HI>Effects;</HI> the <HI>Motions</HI> of his <HI>Will</HI> are entirely <HI>regular</HI> and <HI>calm,</HI> agreeable to right <HI>Reason.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the Love of Christ has the following <HI>Pro∣perties,</HI> viz.</P>
<P>IT is <HI>Everlasting; He has loved us with an everlasting Love, and therefore with loving Kind∣ness has he drawn us.</HI> The Reason why any are powerfully enclin'd and enabled to believe, in Time, is, because they were loved before it, with a Love of <HI>kind Intention.</HI> The <HI>Lord Jesus,</HI> the <HI>Wisdom</HI> of the <HI>Father,</HI> is represented in the <HI>Proverbs</HI> of <HI>Solomon,</HI> as <HI>pleas'd</HI> with his <HI>Designs</HI> of <HI>Mercy</HI> to∣wards the <HI>Children</HI> of <HI>Men.</HI></P>
<P>THE Love of Christ is <HI>free</HI> and unexcited: Our <HI>dear Lord</HI> lov'd us, when there was nothing <HI>lovely</HI> in us! When we <HI>lay in our Blood,</HI> polluted and exposed, <HI>he spread the Skirt of his Affection over us, and said to us, live!</HI> Yea, <HI>when we were Ene∣mies, he died for us!</HI></P>
<P>THE Love of Christ is <HI>immutable: Whom he loves, he loves to the End. He gives his Sheep eter∣nal Life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any pluck them out of his Hand.</HI></P>
<P>THE Love of Christ, my Brethren, is <HI>incom∣prehensible, it passes Knowledge.</HI> Hence are these memorable Words of the Apostle, <HI>And may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the Breadth, and Length, and Depth, and Height, and to know the Love of Christ, which passeth Know∣ledge.</HI> There was a great Love between <HI>David</HI> and <HI>Jonathan; Jonathan</HI> lov'd him as his own Soul! The <HI>Mother's</HI> Love to her <HI>sucking Child</HI> is
<PB N="15" REF="006243_0015_10281D99EC268550"/>
yet greater! And the conjugal Love is doubtless stronger than these! <HI>Am not I better to thee,</HI> said <HI>Elkanah</HI> to his <HI>Consort, than ten Sons?</HI> But the noblest <HI>Instance</HI> of human Love is that of <HI>Paul</HI> to the <HI>Israelites,</HI> who was willing <HI>to be accursed from Christ for them.</HI> Yet these <HI>Affections</HI> glow'd in human <HI>Bosoms,</HI> and so do not transcend human <HI>Knowledge;</HI> but the Love of Christ <HI>passes Know∣ledge,</HI> and therefore has no Parallel in this lower Globe, but resembles the Love which the Father has to him; <HI>As the Father hath loved me,</HI> saith Christ, <HI>even so have I loved you:</HI> But how this is, we can neither conceive or express.</P>
<P>BUT I proceed to speak of the <HI>Manifestations</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI>'s <HI>Love.</HI></P>
<P>NOW the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> manifests itself, by ma∣ny Thoughts about them, and by <HI>high Thoughts</HI> of them; hence they are said <HI>to be graven on the Palms of his Hands, and set as a Seal upon his Heart;</HI> and we are further told, that tho' <HI>the Mother may forget her sucking Child, the Son of her Womb, yet he will not forget them;</HI> and what is still more amazing! is the <HI>high Thoughts</HI> he has of his People; in which respect they are call'd his <HI>Jewels,</HI> his <HI>Treasure,</HI> his <HI>Diadem,</HI> his <HI>Joy,</HI> his <HI>Glory!</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER, the <HI>Love</HI> of <HI>Christ</HI> manifests itself by <HI>Love-Expressions,</HI> with what surprizing Fami∣liarity, and humble Condescension does the <HI>dear Redeemer</HI> address his worthless <HI>Bride,</HI> in the <HI>Song</HI> of <HI>Solomon! Open unto me my Love, my Dove, my Fair One, for my Head is wet with the Dew, and my Locks with the Drops of the Night! who is she
<PB N="16" REF="006243_0016_10281D9B6FC2AF40"/>
that looketh forth as the Morning, fair as the Moon, clear as the Sun.</HI></P>
<P>AND doesn't our dear <HI>Lord Jesus manifest</HI> his <HI>Love</HI> by <HI>beneficent Actions,</HI> by what he has <HI>done</HI> for us, and <HI>given</HI> us? For us he assumed the <HI>hu∣man Nature,</HI> in the most <HI>humble Circumstances</HI> of <HI>Distress</HI> and <HI>Abasement!</HI> For us he fulfilled the divine Law, in all its <HI>Strictness</HI> and <HI>Rigour!</HI> And to us he gives not only all needful temporal <HI>Mer∣cies,</HI> but <HI>spiritual</HI> and <HI>eternal</HI> also! He admits his poor People to a <HI>Marriage-union</HI> with his ado∣rable <HI>Majesty; their Redeemer</HI> is their <HI>Husband, the Lord of Hosts is his Name;</HI> and in Conse∣quence of this dear and valuable <HI>Relation,</HI> he makes them <HI>honourable, powerful, amiable;</HI> they are call'd not Servants only, but the <HI>Friends of God!</HI> And to which of the <HI>Angels</HI> is this Title gi∣ven? <HI>God</HI> is our <HI>Father, Christ</HI> our elder <HI>Bro∣ther,</HI> the <HI>holy Spirit</HI> our <HI>Guide,</HI> the blessed <HI>Angels</HI> our <HI>Guard,</HI> this <HI>Earth</HI> our <HI>Inn,</HI> and <HI>Heaven</HI> our everlasting <HI>Home!</HI></P>
<P>THIS dear Lord does likewise make us <HI>comely thro' his Comeliness, which he puts upon us:</HI> He makes his People all glorious within, he sheds a Lustre on our Souls, that out-shines the Face of <HI>Moses,</HI> when the <HI>Israelites cou'd not behold him;</HI> that out-shines the <HI>Sun,</HI> in his unclouded Bright∣ness, and Meridian <HI>Glory.</HI></P>
<P>AND are not the Sheep of Christ, made by their dearest Lord <HI>powerful?</HI> Yes, through him they have a Kind of <HI>Omnipotence! Thro' him they can do all Things; for whatever they ask in his Name, he will do it for them; all Things are theirs, whe∣ther Apollo, or Cephas, Life or Death.</HI> O the
<PB N="17" REF="006243_0017_10281D9CF1CF2110"/>
stupendous <HI>Prodigy</HI> of the <HI>Goodness</HI> and <HI>Kindness</HI> of <HI>Jesus!</HI> Wonder, O <HI>Heavens,</HI> and be astonished, O <HI>Earth,</HI> at this?</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Sirs,</HI> that which crowns all the divine <HI>Do∣nations</HI> is, that the Love of <HI>Jesus</HI> gives his People an Interest in the <HI>Persons</HI> of the sacred <HI>Trinity.</HI></P>
<P>GOD the <HI>Father</HI> is ours in all his <HI>Attributes</HI>— his <HI>Purposes</HI>—his <HI>Operations</HI>—his <HI>Promises</HI> and <HI>Providences!</HI></P>
<P>GOD the <HI>Son</HI> is ours, he <HI>has given himself to us,</HI> his <HI>Person</HI>—his <HI>Purchase</HI>—his <HI>Offices,</HI> and <HI>Relati∣ons!</HI></P>
<P>GOD the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> is ours, in all his <HI>Influences</HI> and <HI>Graces!—I will pray the Father,</HI> says Jesus to his Disciples, <HI>and he shall give you another Com∣sorter, that he may abide with you forever!</HI> O the unsearchable, inexpressible, unparallel'd, and amazing Love of our Lord Jesus Christ! Can Men, Can Angels fully represent it? No! It is too big, too vast, for human Language to express! Too bright, too glorious, for a human Mind to comprehend! Yea; the Thoughts of the sublimest <HI>Seraphs,</HI> are swallowed up and lost, in this im∣mense, and unfathomable <HI>Ocean!</HI></P>
<P>AGAIN, my dear Brethren, the blessed, the adorable Lord Jesus, has manifested his Love to his poor People, by the most painful <HI>Passions</HI> for them! <HI>He has loved us, and given himself for us.</HI> Here, Sirs, let us pause a little, and enquire who it was that gave himself, to what, for whom, and how.</P>
<P>WHO? a <HI>God</HI> of glorious <HI>Majesty,</HI> a <HI>God</HI> of trans∣cendant <HI>Excellency,</HI> a <HI>God</HI> of unrival'd <HI>Beauty</HI> and <HI>Perfection! Fairer than the Children of Men!
<PB N="18" REF="006243_0018_10281D9E81EFA6B8"/>
Fairer than the Sons of God,</HI> the blessed Angels! Who? a <HI>Being</HI> of almighty <HI>Power!</HI> who by a <HI>Word,</HI> and in a <HI>Moment,</HI> has produced the vast <HI>Bo∣dies</HI> of the <HI>Heavens,</HI> the <HI>Earth</HI> and <HI>Sea</HI> out of no∣thing, and preserves them in their present <HI>Order</HI> and <HI>Existence!</HI> A <HI>Being</HI> of independant <HI>Sove∣reignty!</HI> who is absolute Lord of the Universe, upon whose <HI>Power</HI> all Nature hangs and is depen∣dant, and to whose providential Government, the whole System of <HI>Beings</HI> within the capacious Circuit of the <HI>vast</HI> Creation, must yield a speedy and silent Subjection! Who? A <HI>Being</HI> that ex∣sisted from the Days of <HI>Eternity, Whose Goings forth, have been forever of old, even from Ever∣lasting.</HI> One who is the <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Omega,</HI> the Beginning and the Ending; nor has Succession in Duration! A <HI>Being</HI> of absolute Self-sufficiency, and All-sufficiency; who has enough of Beauty and of Good, within the Verge of his own glori∣ous Essence, to compleat forever his own and his People's <HI>Happiness!</HI> Nor can his essential Glory and Blessedness admit of any <HI>Accession</HI> or <HI>Decay!</HI> A <HI>Being</HI> of infinite Knowledge, who perfectly fore-knew all the present <HI>Unworthiness,</HI> and future <HI>Swervings</HI> of his People from his Statutes: For to him the <HI>Depth</HI> of the Night is as the <HI>Dawn</HI> of the Morning; to him <HI>the End is known, from the Beginning.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to what did this great, this glorious Lord give himself? Why, to <HI>Shame,</HI> to <HI>Misery,</HI> to <HI>Death!</HI> and that of the most ignominious, and formidable Kind! <HI>He humbled himself to Death, even to the Death of the Cross!</HI> O! the severe Chastisement <HI>of our Peace, was laid upon him,
<PB N="19" REF="006243_0019_10281DA59B434F20"/>
that thro' his Stripes we might be healed!</HI> Such was the unutterable Grace and Goodness of the dearest, dearest Lord Jesus, that <HI>tho' he was re∣alty, and incomprehensibly rich,</HI> in the Possession of all his Father's Excellencies, yet he became voluntarily, and, to Appearance, <HI>poor, that we thro' his Poverty might be rich!</HI> The Brightness and unapproachable Blaze of his divine Glory, was veil'd with the humble Mantle of Humanity! <HI>He who counted it not Robbery to be equal to God, assumed the Form of a Servant,</HI> that we might be made the Sons of the highest! <HI>He</HI> who is the un∣failing Spring of Sweetness and Consolation, <HI>be∣came a Man of Sorrows, and acquainted with Grief!</HI> that we might drink of the River of <HI>Pleasures,</HI> that flows from the <HI>Throne</HI> of God and the Lamb! <HI>He,</HI> who is the Center of Rest and Motion, became <HI>weary,</HI> that he might give to the Weary <HI>Rest! He,</HI> who is All-fullness, be∣came <HI>hungry,</HI> that he might feed the Hungry with the <HI>Bread</HI> of Life, the <HI>Apples</HI> of Salvation! <HI>He,</HI> who is Health itself, was <HI>wounded,</HI> that we might be <HI>healed</HI> with the Balm of <HI>Gilead!</HI> He who is the Resurrection and the Life, died that we might <HI>live,</HI> and that forever. O Miracle of Mer∣cy! O inexpressible Prodigy of divine Love!</P>
<P>BUT who were these for whom the blessed Je∣sus endured such intolerable Agonies? Were they Angels, or perfect Creatures? No, They were <HI>Sinners, Rebels, Enemies;</HI> such as had transgressed his righteous Laws; such as had re∣volted from the Allegiance due to his equitable Government, and such as were possessed of a deadly Enmity against his Person and Rule; such
<PB N="20" REF="006243_0020_10281DAA6A55DC30"/>
as were utterly unworthy of his Love, and neither sought it, nor were able to requite it; such who, even after Conversion, are in a Degree <HI>ungrateful, jealous, disloyal,</HI> make not suitable Returns for Benefits received, suspect his Kindness, and are disposed to spiritual Whoredom!</P>
<P>BUT how did the dearest Lord Jesus give him∣self? I answer; Most freely. <HI>In the Volume of thy Book,</HI> saith he, <HI>it is written of me, lo I come to do thy Will, O God, and thy Law is within my Heart!</HI> All Manner of Miseries he endured most patiently. <HI>He was led like a Lamb to the Slaugh∣ter, so he opened not his Mouth: Yea he was streight'ned till his Sufferings for our Sakes were accomplished.</HI> O astonishing Love!</P>
<P>AND tho' the Persons whom the blessed Lord Jesus set his Love upon, were such as have been described, yet he loved them more than the best of Men love one another; <HI>Greater Love hath no Man, than that a Man lay down his Life for his Friend; but Christ hath laid down his Life for his Enemies.</HI></P>
<P>YEA, the holy Jesus loves Man more then he loves himself. The unregenerate Man loves not his Soul, the noblest Part of himself; nor does he love his Body in Reference to Eternity—And the Love of the regenerate Man is imperfect, but the Love of Christ was without Defect.</P>
<P>I MAY add, my <HI>Brethren,</HI> That the dear Re∣deemer <HI>loves</HI> Men more than <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth;</HI> for he left the one, and rejected the Offers of the other for his sake.</P>
<P>AND didn't the Lord Jesus love Men more than the Angels? <HI>For he took not upon him their Na∣ture;</HI>
<PB N="21" REF="006243_0021_10281DABEFD214A8"/>
nor is there any <HI>Offer</HI> of <HI>Mercy</HI> made thro' him, to those that fell from their original State.</P>
<P>YEA we may say that the adorable Redeemer lov'd his People, in some Respects, more than <HI>himself!</HI> He pray'd for them more than himself; and that when he was just entering upon the last Scene of his awful <HI>Sufferings!</HI> He expressed more <HI>Joy</HI> at their <HI>Welfare,</HI> than his own, as Man: With what Keenness and Pungency did he re∣prove the Apostle <HI>Peter,</HI> when he advised him to <HI>spare</HI> himself? <HI>Get thee behind me, Satan!</HI> When the <HI>Disciples</HI> inform'd him of the Success of their <HI>Ministry,</HI> tho' he was <HI>a Man of Sorrows,</HI> yet he <HI>rejoyced</HI> on that <HI>Occasion!</HI></P>
<P>ADD to this, that he willingly suffered the Sword of <HI>Justice</HI> to pierce his Heart, rather than Men should <HI>suffer</HI> eternally! He <HI>gave himself</HI> a Sacrifice to avenging <HI>Wrath!</HI> A Prey to <HI>Murde∣rers,</HI> and to all Manner of <HI>Miseries!</HI> This <HI>Offer∣ing</HI> of Christ was, as our Text asserts, <HI>Of a sweet-smelling Savour to God!</HI> i. e. <HI>Propitiatory,</HI> and satisfactory for the Sins of Men.</P>
<P>AND indeed the Love of Jesus is such, as in∣clin'd him, not only to <HI>give</HI> himself to suffer for us, all the <HI>Miseries</HI> our Sins deserved, if not alto∣gether in <HI>Kind,</HI> yet in <HI>Weight;</HI> but likewise to suffer by us, and with us. O! his Love incites him to bear many Affronts from us, tho' <HI>we make him to serve by our Sins, and he is as it were pres∣sed under them, as a Cart under Sheaves:</HI> Yet af∣ter all our <HI>Backslidings,</HI> which are, in some Re∣spects, more heinous then the Sins of others; be∣cause committed against greater <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Mer∣cy.</HI> He invites us to <HI>return,</HI> and graciously pro∣mises
<PB N="22" REF="006243_0022_10281DAD9910CF20"/>
upon our doing so, <HI>To heal our Backslidings▪ and love us freely!</HI> And doesn't his Love dispose him to <HI>simpathize</HI> with us, in all our Sorrows! <HI>In all our Afflictions he is afflicted! We have not a High Priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our Infirmities, but was in all Things tempted as we are, yet without Sin.</HI></P>
<P>I proceed to the <HI>Improvement</HI> of this Subject.</P>
<P>METHINKS what has been said, should excite us to enquire, whether Christ loves us with a special <HI>complacential</HI> Love? If so, we have been made to <HI>see</HI> and <HI>feel</HI> our absolute <HI>Need</HI> of his <HI>Righ∣teousness,</HI> so as to be <HI>shut up</HI> thereto, as the only <HI>Door of Hope:</HI> If so, <HI>Christ has manifested him∣self to us</HI> by his Gospel, in Regard of his All-suf∣ficiency and Willingness to <HI>save</HI> poor Sinners! So that we have hereby been induced to venture our Souls upon the alone <HI>Foundation</HI> of his Merit, for our <HI>Acceptance</HI> with God; and have hereupon received such Communications of his Love, as have inclin'd us to <HI>love</HI> him habitually, supremely, ingenuously; <HI>We love him</HI> (says the Apostle <HI>John) because he has loved us first:</HI> And does our Love to Christ constrain us, to endeavour a universal, willing, and persevering Obedience to his <HI>Pre∣cepts? Then are ye my Friends,</HI> says Christ, <HI>if ye do whatever I command you.</HI></P>
<P>FARTHER, my <HI>Brethren,</HI> we should enquire, <HI>whether we walk in Love,</HI> so as has been before hinted? If so, it is a blessed Evidence of our being <HI>Translated from Death to Life:</HI> Such as upon Enquiry, find the aforesaid <HI>Characters</HI> in them∣selves, may safely conclude, that they are in a State of <HI>Favour</HI> with God; <HI>And if God is for
<PB N="23" REF="006243_0023_10281DB3DAE53548"/>
them, who shall be against them?</HI> They have great Reason to <HI>rejoyce in Christ Jesus, and again to re∣joyce,</HI> however difficult and distressing their out∣ward <HI>Circumstances</HI> may be! For all that they meet with in Time, shall be turn'd to their Ad∣vantage in the <HI>Issue; They shall work together for their Good: Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or Life, or Death, all is theirs, and they are Christ's, and Christ is God's!</HI> Remember, dear <HI>Brethren, That your Sufferings in this Life, which are but for a Moment, are not worthy to be compa∣red with the exceeding great and eternal Weight of Glory, which shall be,</HI> in a little Time, <HI>reveal∣ed to you,</HI> and you made Possessors thereof.</P>
<P>BUT such as are destitute of the aforesaid Cha∣racters, have great Reason to <HI>mourn</HI> and <HI>lament!</HI> For their prent State is unspeakably <HI>dangerous,</HI> and extreamly <HI>miserable!</HI> Without Christ there is no true Safety, nor solid Comfort: He is the on∣ly <HI>Hiding-place,</HI> that can effectually screen us from the Storms of divine Wrath! The only <HI>Fountain</HI> of <HI>Consolation,</HI> that can effectually sweeten our <HI>Sorrows,</HI> satisfy our <HI>Desires,</HI> and sup∣port our <HI>Hopes!</HI></P>
<P>YE should therefore be entreated, <HI>Sirs,</HI> to seek an <HI>Interest</HI> in the Love of Christ, and the <HI>E∣vidence</HI> of it; the former makes your State <HI>safe,</HI> the latter <HI>comfortable.</HI> The sensible Knowledge of Christ's Love to us, is a <HI>Heaven</HI> upon <HI>Earth!</HI> This makes us bold in <HI>Danger,</HI> and patient in <HI>Adversity;</HI> this asswages every <HI>Grief,</HI> and is as Oyl to the Wheels of <HI>Devotion;</HI> this gives a fresh Spring to our animal <HI>Spirits,</HI> a new Relish to our outward <HI>Comforts,</HI> and is the very <HI>Life</HI> of Life!
<PB N="24" REF="006243_0024_10281DB714CABD18"/>
This makes the Mind calm and serene, when the <HI>Surges</HI> of <HI>Difficulty</HI> swell, and the <HI>Tempest</HI> roars; it is enough if Christ be ours; of whom then, or of what should we be afraid?</P>
<P>NOW to obtain an Interest in your <HI>Redeemer</HI>'s Love,</P>
<P>LABOUR to know your <HI>Need</HI> of him, as well as his <HI>Ability</HI> and <HI>Readiness</HI> to relieve all that take their Flight to him.</P>
<P>BELIEVE on the Lord Jesus Christ.</P>
<P>THINK much on the <HI>Riches</HI> of his Love, con∣tain'd in the precious <HI>Promises.</HI></P>
<P>TRY to be like him in Heart and in Life; such as <HI>say they have Fellowship with him and walk in Darkness, do lie, and know not the Truth.</HI></P>
<P>AND such who have an <HI>Interest</HI> in Christ's Love, but want the <HI>Evidence</HI> of it,</P>
<P>LET them endeavour to <HI>know, and do the</HI> Will <HI>of God: He that hath my Commandments, and keepeth them,</HI> saith Christ, <HI>he it is that loveth me, and he that loveth me, shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifest myself to him.</HI></P>
<P>CONVERSE much with Christ, by serious and delightful <HI>Study.</HI></P>
<P>BEWARE of Unbelief, and unkind Returns for Mercies received; <HI>When he speaks Peace, do not return to Folly.</HI>—</P>
<P>CRY for <HI>Assurance</HI> to a gracious God, for Christ's sake, with <HI>Hopes</HI> of obtaining it.—</P>
<P>WALK IN LOVE, <HI>as Christ also has loved us;</HI> live in Love, let this be your <HI>Element!</HI></P>
<P>LOVE as Christ did, let your Thoughts be kind; <HI>For Charity thinks no Evil, but hopes all Things, and believes all Things that are good of our Bro∣ther,</HI>
<PB N="25" REF="006243_0025_10281DB8988A1EA8"/>
as far as there is any Reason for it. Let your Speeches be courteous, <HI>Put on, as the Elect of God, Bowels of Mercy, Kindness, and Humble∣ness of Mind; be pitiful, be courteous, and O let your Actions be beneficent: Say not to the Hungry, be fed, and to the Naked, be clothed, when it is in the Power of your Hand to give:</HI> If so, <HI>How dwells the Love of God in you?</HI> The Love of Christ is a long-suffering, sympathizing, forgiving, and enduring Love; and so shou'd ours be: In case of <HI>Offences,</HI> and different <HI>Sentiments</HI> in <HI>Reli∣gion,</HI> bear, forbear, forgive; <HI>In Meekness and Long-suffering,</HI> says the Apostle, <HI>forbearing and forgiving one another, even as God has, for Christ's sake, forgiven you.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, Sirs, ye shou'd <HI>walk</HI> in Love to∣wards your <HI>Brethren,</HI> because <HI>Christ has loved you:</HI> He has forgiven much to you, and will not you forgive a little to your poor <HI>Brother?</HI> He has graciously cancell'd your <HI>Debt</HI> of a Thousand <HI>Ta∣lents,</HI> and will you take your <HI>Brother</HI> by the <HI>Throat</HI> for a few <HI>Pence?</HI> Christ bears with innu∣merable Weaknesses in you, and won't you bear with a few in your <HI>Brother?</HI> No more powerful <HI>Argument</HI> can be offered to the Sons of Men, to invite their Love, than the Love of Christ. Dear <HI>Sirs!</HI> by walking in Love to your <HI>Brethren,</HI> you fulfil the second <HI>Table</HI> of the <HI>Law,</HI> and evi∣dence to your selves, as well as others, your gra∣cious State: This is truly amiable, the right Way to promote the <HI>Glory</HI> of God, and the <HI>Good</HI> of So∣ciety. O! <HI>How amiable is it for Brethren to dwell together in Unity?</HI></P>
<P>IS it not, dear <HI>Sirs!</HI> one great <HI>Design</HI> of the <HI>Ordinance</HI> in view, to promote <HI>Brotherly Love?</HI>
<PB N="26" REF="006243_0026_10281DBA1B0EF8B0"/>
by setting before us, sensible <HI>Representations</HI> of the dying Love of Christ? And hence 'tis call'd a Love-Feast.</P>
<P>THIS leads me to say, That another excellent <HI>Mean</HI> of obtaining <HI>Assurance,</HI> is, to attend with <HI>Humility, Sincerity,</HI> and <HI>Hope,</HI> upon the blessed <HI>Ordinance</HI> of the <HI>Lord's-Supper,</HI> by which <HI>we shew forth his Death till he come again.</HI> This is de∣sign'd not only as a <HI>Sign</HI> to represent the <HI>Strength</HI> of the Redeemer's <HI>Affection,</HI> but as a <HI>Seal</HI> to con∣firm our Interest in it. O then! <HI>while the King comes to his Table, let our Spikenard send forth the Smell thereof: Who is this that comes from Bozra, with Garments died red, travelling in the Great∣ness of his Strength?</HI> O how amiable is our Lord in his bloody <HI>Robes! Quot vulnera tot ora;</HI> As many Wounds as he received for us, so many Mouths are open to plead for our Love to him.</P>
<P>SUFFER me here, my <HI>Brethren,</HI> to enlarge a little upon this solemn <HI>sacramental Occasion!</HI> Let us, dear <HI>Sirs!</HI> take a transient Survey of our Lord's ABASURE and SUFFERINGS, by which he express'd the Strength of his <HI>Love</HI> to <HI>us!</HI></P>
<P>IT is strange indeed! that the great GOD shou'd stoop so low, as to <HI>make himself of no Reputation</HI> for our sakes, and <HI>appear in the Fashion of a Man!</HI> Strange! That the <HI>Antient of Days, whose Goings forth are of old, from Everlasting,</HI> should be born in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> an Infant of a Minute old! Strange! That He, whose <HI>Immensity</HI> fills <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> and infinitely extends beyond the <HI>Bounds</HI> of the <HI>Creation,</HI> shou'd be confin'd in a <HI>Virgin</HI>'s <HI>Womb!</HI> Shou'd be wrapt in Swadling Cloths! and laid in a Manger, a Stable! Strange! That the immortal impassible <HI>Creator,</HI> and <HI>Lord</HI>
<PB N="27" REF="006243_0027_10281DBC1AF35E48"/>
of all, shou'd assume, for our sakes, the inocent <HI>Infirmities</HI> and <HI>Passions</HI> of his poor <HI>Creatures!</HI> and so <HI>come in the Likeness of sinful Flesh!</HI> That he shou'd begin to live and grow, shou'd hunger and thirst, shou'd bleed and die!</P>
<P>WHAT a <HI>Wonder</HI> is this to Men and Angels? to behold <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Earth,</HI> GOD and <HI>Man,</HI> u∣nited in one <HI>Person!</HI> To see <HI>Immensity</HI> confin'd in a narrow <HI>Compass!</HI> and to behold at once, a <HI>Virgin-Mother,</HI> and an <HI>Infant-God!</HI></P>
<P>STRANGE! That the <HI>Beauty</HI> of Heaven, whom all the Angels worship, shou'd appear with∣out <HI>Form and Comeliness</HI> upon the Earth! Should be <HI>despis'd and rejected!</HI> Should be deemed the <HI>Reproach of Men, and Out-cast of the People!</HI> Shou'd be <HI>oppressed, and afflicted! taken from Prison, and from Judgment, and cut off at last from the Land of the Living!</HI> Good God! What a Scene is this? What Love, what matchless Love is here? O! Can we believe it, and not be fir'd with the Thought, to <HI>love</HI> God and Man, <HI>And walk in Love!</HI></P>
<P>SIRS, The venerable <HI>Name</HI> of our dear <HI>Lord!</HI> which is as fragrant <HI>Ointment poured forth,</HI> and aromatick Spices broken! was covered with a Cloud of unjust <HI>Scandal</HI> and <HI>Reproach!</HI> He was call'd <HI>A Friend of Publicans and Sinners, a glu∣tonous Person, a Wine-bibber,</HI> and one whom by Inchantment <HI>cast out Devils!</HI> O! what sweet Support may this yield to those that endure unjust <HI>Invectives</HI> for his sake! <HI>i. e.</HI> For their firm and inviolable Adherence to the <HI>Truths</HI> he has reveal∣ed, and the <HI>Duties</HI> he has prescribed!</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="006243_0028_10281DC7191E57F8"/>THE blessed Jesus had no worldly Substance but his <HI>Clothes,</HI> and these they at last bereaved him of; <HI>They parted his Raiment amongst them, and cast Lets upon his Vesture!</HI> O! Methinks! the voluntary <HI>Poverty</HI> of the Son of God, may serve to reconcile the <HI>Poor</HI> to their humble <HI>Circumstan∣ces;</HI> especially when they consider that the Son of God, who made the <HI>Universe,</HI> and all the <HI>Be∣ings</HI> it contains, <HI>Had no where to lay his</HI> blessed Head <HI>upon!</HI> No <HI>Horse!</HI> No <HI>House</HI> of his own, but liv'd upon the <HI>Charity</HI> of others; for are they not hereby conform'd to him?</P>
<P>AFTER a Life of <HI>Labour</HI> and of <HI>Grief,</HI> behold the dear <HI>Redeemer</HI> drawing near the Period of this weary Scene! See he is betrayed by one of his own <HI>Disciples,</HI> and deserted by the rest in his <HI>Ex∣tremity!</HI> O the Unkindness of Friends is exceed∣ingly distressing <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Is this <HI>Brutus</HI> my Friend, said <HI>Caesar</HI> in the <HI>Senate-House,</HI> when he was going to stab him!</NOTE>! See <HI>Goodness</HI> itself unjustly ac∣cus'd, and cruelly condemn'd! See how a <HI>Heed</HI> of <HI>Russians</HI> hurry my dearest Lord, from <HI>Court</HI> to <HI>Court,</HI> and treat the glorious <HI>Majesty</HI> of Heaven with the utmost <HI>Rudeness</HI> and <HI>Contempt!</HI> See how they treat the <HI>Fountain</HI> of <HI>Kindness,</HI> yea, <HI>Love</HI> it∣self, with <HI>Cruelty</HI> and <HI>Hate!</HI> See how they wound his sacred <HI>Body</HI> with severe <HI>Scourges,</HI> so that he was all over of a <HI>bloody Gore,</HI> and his <HI>Raiment</HI> bespatter'd with <HI>Blood!</HI> See how the in∣human <HI>Monsters</HI> smite our Lord <HI>with the Palms of their Hands,</HI> and in Contempt, <HI>spit upon his Face,</HI> the Seat of <HI>Majesty</HI> and <HI>Beauty!</HI> O horrid <HI>Indigni∣ty!</HI> O barbarous <HI>Villainy!</HI> Look how they <HI>beat</HI> with a <HI>Reed</HI> the contemptuous <HI>thorny Crown</HI> into
<PB N="29" REF="006243_0029_10281DC938BE6DA0"/>
his sacred <HI>Temples,</HI> and salute him in Disdain, <HI>Hail King of the Jews!</HI> Look how they drive <HI>Nails</HI> into those blessed <HI>Feet,</HI> that were incessant∣ly employed in unwearied <HI>Travels,</HI> to diffuse <HI>Be∣nignity</HI> and <HI>Good</HI> among the Miserable; to dif∣fuse <HI>Light</HI> to the <HI>Blind, Health</HI> to the <HI>Sick,</HI> and <HI>Life</HI> to the <HI>Dead!</HI> See how they bind with <HI>Cords,</HI> and <HI>wound</HI> with <HI>Nails</HI> those Hands that were fre∣quently lifted up to Heaven, in humble Supplica∣tions for them, and in communicating <HI>Blessings</HI> to them!</P>
<P>THE <HI>Kind</HI> of <HI>Death</HI> that our Lord endured, <HI>viz.</HI> by <HI>Crucifixion,</HI> was very <HI>dishonourable,</HI> none but Slaves were subject to it; moreover he was put to <HI>Death</HI> between <HI>Malefactors</HI> of the most scandalous <HI>Kind!</HI> and hung between the Heavens and the Earth! as if he that had made both, was fit to be entertain'd by neither!</P>
<P>FARTHER, the aforesaid Kind of <HI>Death,</HI> was exceeding <HI>painful,</HI> the whole Weight of his <HI>Bo∣dy</HI> being hung upon some sinewy nervous Parts, and the fatal <HI>Cross</HI> being put into the Ground, by a sudden <HI>Jog,</HI> when it was rais'd up, after our Lord was nail'd to it, must needs cause the ac∣cutest Pains<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Ausonius</HI> calls it, <HI>Pené extremum,</HI> the Extremity of Punish∣ment; and <HI>Cicero, crudelishmum, &amp; teterrimum Supi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>cium;</HI> a most cruel and horrid Punishment.</NOTE>!</P>
<P>IN this Extremity of <HI>Anguish</HI> and Misery, they derided with ungenerous <HI>Sneers</HI> and <HI>Sar∣casms,</HI> our Lord, our Love! <HI>They reviled him, wagging their Heads, and saying. Thou that de∣stroyest the Temple, and buildest it in three Days, save thyself: If thou be the Son of God, come down
<PB N="30" REF="006243_0030_10281DCAC12CC418"/>
from the Cross.</HI> This was an <HI>Instance</HI> of horrid <HI>Inhumanity!</HI></P>
<P>THEN was his Heart pierced with a cruel Spear, <HI>Whence came Blood and Water, for the healing of the Nations;</HI> a Stream that waters the <HI>Garden</HI> of God!</P>
<P>BUT the Sufferings our Lord endured in his Soul, were infinitely greater than those he suf∣fered in his Body.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Garden</HI> of <HI>Gethsemany,</HI> his Soul was sorrowful even unto <HI>Death!</HI> There he prostra∣ted himself upon the cold <HI>Ground!</HI> and thro' inward Anguish and <HI>Agony,</HI> Sweat great Drops of Blood, shed thro' all his Pores a crimson Shower! It is doubtless chiefly in regard of the Sufferings of his Soul, that he is said to <HI>Drink the bitter Cup, and tread the Wine-press of his Father's Wrath,</HI> as well as conflict with the <HI>Pow∣ers</HI> of <HI>Darkness!</HI> In his Soul he endured a Degree of <HI>Pain,</HI> equal to the Demerit of the Sins of those he represented; and hence he is said to <HI>make his Soul an Offering for Sin,</HI> and this <HI>Offering is said to be, as a sweet-smelling Savour to God?</HI> that is, pleasing and satisfactory!</P>
<P>HIS <HI>Father</HI>'s <HI>deserting him,</HI> and causing the Sword of his <HI>Justice</HI> to <HI>awake against him,</HI> bro't his Sufferings to the highest <HI>Crisis</HI> of <HI>Extremity!</HI> This, O this! made the Lamb of God lament and <HI>cry</HI> to his <HI>Father,</HI> in the most dolorous and piteous Accents, <HI>Eloi, Eloi, Lama Sabacthani? My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?</HI> O <HI>Cry!</HI> Enough to rend the Heavens!</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sun,</HI> that glorious <HI>Orb</HI> of <HI>Light,</HI> and <HI>Pa∣rent</HI> of the <HI>Day,</HI> justly refused to <HI>behold</HI> so terri∣ble
<PB N="31" REF="006243_0031_10281DCCAB8C50C0"/>
a <HI>Tragedy,</HI> and therefore wrapt himself in <HI>Darkness!</HI> Then was the <HI>Vail of the Temple rent in twain!</HI> the hard <HI>Rocks burst in Pieces!</HI> the <HI>Earth</HI> shook at its <HI>Foundations,</HI> and trembled on its <HI>Axis!</HI> the <HI>Dead</HI> themselves <HI>awoke</HI> out of their Iron Slumbers, and hast'ned out of their dark and silent <HI>Retreats,</HI> to compleat the Train of <HI>Mourn∣ers,</HI> and bewail the <HI>Funeral</HI> of a GOD!</P>
<P>O DEAR <HI>Brethren!</HI> let us <HI>behold</HI> these Suffer∣ings of our Lord with Sorrow for our Sins, the de∣serving <HI>Causes</HI> of them, as well as with <HI>Love</HI> to him, and in Consequence thereof, with Love to Man∣kind in general, and to those that are pious in parti∣cular.</P>
<P>O BRETHREN! If these Things do not affect us, we are blinder than <HI>Moles!</HI> and more hard∣hearted than <HI>Rocks,</HI> than <HI>Adamants!</HI> For those relented, as it were, when their <HI>Creator</HI> expired! If our Hearts are not fired with this Subject, we are colder than <HI>Ice</HI> and <HI>Snow!</HI></P>
<P>IF we are not mov'd with <HI>Gratitude</HI> for such Love, we are more sordid than the <HI>Beasts</HI> that perish! for these express a Kind of <HI>Gratitude</HI> to their <HI>Benefactors! The Ox knows his Owner, and the Ass his Master's Crib!</HI></P>
<P>IF we will not accept of, and improve this in∣expressible Love of our Lord Jesus, we are more inexcusable than the impenitent <HI>Jews;</HI> seeing we enjoy, thro' divine Goodness, a brighter <HI>Dispen∣sation</HI> than they; the ceremonial, typical <HI>Vail is rent,</HI> and <HI>Light</HI> and <HI>Day</HI> is pour'd upon the World, with a more liberal and extensive <HI>Effusion,</HI> since the <HI>Messiah</HI>'s <HI>Incarnation;</HI> now the <HI>Jewish</HI> Night is banished; <HI>The Day-spring from on high has visited us, and the Sun of Righteousness has a∣risen,
<PB N="32" REF="006243_0032_10281DCFCF4F4FC0"/>
with Healing in his Wings,</HI> and shone with unclouded <HI>Lustre, so that we may with open Face behold the Glory of God in the Face of Christ! i. e.</HI> The harmonious <HI>Concurrence,</HI> and beauteous <HI>Ma∣nifestation</HI> of the divine <HI>Attributes,</HI> in the Way of Man's <HI>Redemption</HI> and Salvation by Jesus Christ!</P>
<P>FARTHER in the Case aforesaid, we are more inexcusable than <HI>Pagans,</HI> who have never had our Advantages, in respect of outward <HI>Priviledge, but sit in Darkness, and in the Region and Shadow of Death!</HI></P>
<P>NAY we are, if we continue impenitent, in some <HI>Respect,</HI> more inexcusable than <HI>Devils;</HI> for, so far as we know, they never had an Offer of <HI>Mercy,</HI> after their <HI>Apostacy!</HI> How then <HI>shall we escape, if we neglect so great Salvation?</HI> A <HI>Sal∣vation</HI> purchased by the <HI>Blood</HI> of God; a Salvati∣on freely offered, and that to the very worst of Men, who will <HI>repent</HI> of their Sins and <HI>believe</HI> in Jesus! A Salvation that has every Thing that is <HI>great</HI> and <HI>good,</HI> and valuable in it, and that fore∣ver!</P>
<P>CAN we escape by <HI>Policy?</HI> No! Men may be impos'd upon by false Pretexts, but God is <HI>all Eye,</HI> yea, <HI>Wisdom</HI> and <HI>Knowledge</HI> itself, <HI>There is no Darkness or Shadow of Death, where the Workers of Iniquity can hide themselves;</HI> No! <HI>To him the Darkness is as the Light, and Midnight as Noon∣day!</HI></P>
<P>CAN we by <HI>Power?</HI> No! <HI>Jehovah</HI> is almighty <HI>in Strength; when he speaks, the Pillars of Heaven tremble, the Earth's Foundations shake,</HI> the <HI>Devils roar,</HI> and all the <HI>Tribes</HI> of inanimate <HI>Creatures</HI> unreluctant obey his Word: Dare we, <HI>whose
<PB N="33" REF="006243_0033_10281DD6D47624D8"/>
Habitation is in the Dust, whose Breath is in our Nostrils, and who are crushed before the Moth, rush upon Jehovah's Buckler? Have we an Arm like God, and can we thunder with a Voice like him? He is wise in Heart, and mighty in Strength; who has ever hardned himself against God, and prospered?</HI></P>
<P>CAN we escape by Flight? No! He is every where present; <HI>Should we take the Morning's Wings, and fly to the uttermost Parts of the Earth, or Sea, even there God's Hand would lead us, and his Right-hand hold us. If I ascend to Heaven,</HI> says the Psalmist, <HI>thou art there; if I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there!</HI> Should we mount <HI>Carmel</HI>'s Heights, or dive the Ocean's Depths! Should we seek the obscurest Recess in the wide Circle of the Creation, we cou'dn't pos∣sibly escape the Notice of his all-penetrating Eye, or the Reach of his Almighty Arm!</P>
<P>O! <HI>It will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrha, in the Day of the Lord, than for</HI> any of us, that continue impenitent; <HI>This is the Con∣demnation, that Light is come into the World, and we love Darkness rather than Light, because our Deeds are Evil.</HI> Surely the blessed Jesus <HI>will be revealed from Heaven in flaming Fire, to take Vengeance on those that know not God, who shall be punished with everlasting Destruction, from the Presence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power!</HI></P>
<P>BUT let me speak a few Words to the Commu∣nicants, and then conclude; Come my dear Bre∣thren, to this Solemnity, with a Reverence of God's Majesty upon your Spirits; <HI>How awful is
<PB N="34" REF="006243_0034_10281DD8B05083D8"/>
this Place? Surely it is no other than the House of God, and this is the Gate of</HI> Heaven; come with vehement Hunger <HI>and Thirsting after the Bread and Waters of Life;</HI> come <HI>with a humble Sense of your Unworthiness</HI> of the Priviledge of coming to the Table of the King of Kings!</P>
<P>COME with a firm Resolution, <HI>To live to him, that died for you!</HI></P>
<P>COME with a deep Sorrow for your Offences, that have been the meritorious Causes of Christ's Sufferings!</P>
<P>CAN ye, dear Sirs! behold in this Sacramental Memorial, the Symbols of those Sufferings of the Son of God, which were before hinted, and not be affected? If so, it is lamentable indeed! Sure∣ly a View of them, may justly strike the Springs of your Grief.</P>
<P>BEHOLD the Tears of Humanity, Compassion and Love, which Jesus shed at the Grave of <HI>La∣zarus,</HI> and over the impenitent City of <HI>Jerusa∣lem!</HI> when he address'd it as follows: <HI>If thou,</HI> or as some render the Words, <HI>O that thou hadst known in this thy Day, the Things that belong to thy Peace, but now they are hid from thine Eyes!</HI> See his Sorrows, his Wounds, his Blood, his Death!</P>
<P>HARK and listen to his Sighs, his Groans, his dolorous Out-cry on the Cross, <HI>Eloi, Eloi, Lama Sabacthani; My God, my God, why hast thou for∣saken me.</HI></P>
<P>See his compassionate Arms open'd on the cru∣el Tree, open'd to embrace in tender Mercy, e∣very returning Prodigal, how many and how great soever his Transgressions have been notwith∣standing.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="006243_0035_10281DDAA8A1EE88"/>BEHOLD with humble Astonishment, Innocen∣cy condemned, Beauty stained, and Love it self despised, in all its Riches and Charms! See Sal∣vation suffering, Strength languishing, and Life expiring! The Angels wonder at the Tragedy! the Earth quivers for Fear! the visible Heaven shuts its radiant Eye by a dark Eclipse, and refused to behold so sad a Spectacle! so sorrowful a Scene! The Rocks themselves express'd a Sympathy with their suffering Creator, to the perpetual Re∣proach of Sinners, that are harder than they! And universal Nature mourn'd!</P>
<P>BEHOLD, my dear Brethren! the blessed Bridegroom cometh, clothed with Majesty, as with a Robe; with Light, as with a Garment; with Zeal, as with a Cloak: See he is <HI>girt with a golden Girdle, his Head and Hairs are white as Snow, and his Eyes are as a Flame of Fire, his Feet like unto fine Brass, as if they burned in a Furnace, and his Voice as the Sound of many Wa∣ters!</HI> See the unrivall'd Beauty of his Person, and the inexpressible Riches of his Love!</P>
<P>OUR adorable Jesus, <HI>Is white and ruddy, the chiefest among Ten thousand!</HI> He is white in Re∣gard of his unsullied Innocence, and red in Re∣gard of his severe Sufferings for us! See he comes from <HI>Bozra</HI> and <HI>Edom, with his Garments died red!</HI> his Vesture is discoloured, or rather adorn∣ed with his Heart's-Blood; O amazing Sight! See those Wounds, Believer, he patiently and wil∣lingly bore for thee! Wounds which are Scars of Honour, Signatures of Victory, and Arguments of Love and Endearment!</P>
<P><PB N="36" REF="006243_0036_10281DDE64DC91B8"/>SURELY <HI>his Garments smell of Myrrh, Aloes and Cassia, out of the Ivory Palaces.</HI> Now let the <HI>everlasting Doors of your Souls open</HI> to embrace your Lord; now let <HI>your Bowels move for him;</HI> now <HI>let your Hands drop with Myrrh, with sweet-smelling Myrrh, upon the Handles of the Lock! While the King sits at his Table, let your Spike∣nard send forth the Smell thereof;</HI> seeing the <HI>Marriage of the Lamb is come, O let the Spouse make herself ready</HI> to embrace him. <HI>Amen.</HI> Even so come Lord Jesus. <HI>Amen. Amen.</HI></P>
