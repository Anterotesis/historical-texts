<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>HEN Error and its Advocates are so busie in proselyting the World, I know nor why a modest Confutation should be judged Criminal. Or why those who engage in the Behalf of Truth, should be thought meddling and contentious? Especially when the Pattons of Error endeavour to establish their Oppinions, by assuming to them the Dress of Verity, and to give them a Sancti∣on in the Eyes of the World, and croud them und<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r the Protection of God himself.</P>
<P>Of such is the Author of the afore high
<PB N="4" REF="040110_0003_10162DB22039B5C8"/>
recommended Treatise; yet neither the Work it self, nor the Authors fl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>id Title thereto p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>efi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed, prevent my Animadversions thereon, especially when I consider how few of that Ra<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k Christ employed in his Ministry when on Earth, and now little disirous the Apostles his Successors of those empty Titles, as <HI>Paul</HI> himself rectifies, when he gl<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rys only in his many Afflictions and Poverty. But this Author's preferring the Name of <HI>Gentleman,</HI> to that of CHRISTIAN, is, no doubt to advance him∣self, as well as his Work, in the Opinion of the World.</P>
<P>The whole Work it self, is like the <HI>Chaos</HI> in the Beginning, Void of Light and Order, and overspread with impenetrable Clouds of Darkness, charged with dangerous and hurt∣ful Errors which shews that God has not commanded Light to be there, nor was at all concerned in the Composition or Contrivance thereof.</P>
<P>The Gentleman saith that the Occasion of his writing was some Deistical Papers la<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ly printed at <HI>Newport;</HI> but I am of the Opinion that he is unacquainted with the Tenets of Deism, or the issuing of a deistical Paper would never have se<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> him to quarreling with the Quakers, whose Principles are far from Deistical, neither has he mentioned the Name of <HI>Deist,</HI> except in the Title Page of his Book.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="040110_0003_10162DB22039B5C8"/>
And in order to rescue the Quakers from so unjust a Charge, I shall give the Read∣er a short Detail of the Principles of a Deist; and then it will be requisit of the Gentleman to prove that the Quakers are Deists, on whom the Reflections, in his Book are chief∣ly thrown, which if he should fail to do, I hope he will be so just, to do as he has done before, <HI>viz.</HI> Recant</P>
<P>The Deists deny <HI>Revealed Religion,</HI> viz. That God ever communicated the Knowledge of himself to Mankind by any supernatural Method: But the Quakers (the Gentleman himself confesses) contend for a Superior Dictator, <HI>viz. The Spirit of God:</HI> The Deists deny the Worship of God through Jesus Christ, which the Quakers hold to be the only excep∣table Way of worshiping him, with other Things very different from the Beleif of the Quakers; so that I am at a Loss to know why the printing of a Deistical Paper should provoke the Gentleman to quarrel with a People so different in Opininion from the Deists as the Quakers are.</P>
<P>The first Eight or Nine Pages of his Book are spent, in proving. That which no Body hereabouts contradicts, <HI>viz. That the Christian Revelation, is exellent, and necessary.</HI> But the Grand Question in Debate, is, <HI>What this Christian Revelation is, and how made known?</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="040110_0004_10162DB3B57F34A8"/>
which our Author seems to resolve in Page <HI>10th,</HI> where he calls the Bible, <HI>The Rule of Faith, by which we ought to try our Opinions.</HI> And since the whole Tenor of his Book aims to confine all Religion to the Bible, and the external Ordinances therein contained. I shall endeavor to confute, by proving, That God has saved Mankind, and communicated the Knowledge of his Son sufficient to Salvation without the Help of the Bible, or any of the external Ordinances therein mentioned; which if I should do, I know not why the Bible it self, and more especialy the External Ordinances it contains, should be enumerated among the Graces essential to Christianity, on why those who gratefully accept the Former as proceeded from the Spirit of God, and therefore understand it in a Spiritual Manner, although they disallow the Use of the Latter; I say, I know not why they should be loaded with false and odious Opinions to render them vile in the Sight of the World. In order to prove the abovementioned Assertion, <HI>viz.</HI> That God has communicated the Know∣ledge of his Son sufficient to Salvation with∣out the Bible, or any of the external Ordi∣nances taught therein, it would be obvious for the Reader to search the Origine thereof, which if he should do, he will find no Foot∣steps of it in the World, till about. Two Thousand Four Hundred Years after the Creation; about which Time the Law was
<PB N="7" REF="040110_0004_10162DB3B57F34A8"/>
to the <HI>Jews,</HI> all which Time, the most severe Formalist must grant that Mankind had no outward Revelation of the Will of God, al∣though it appears by the Bible it self, That Christ was taught, and the Gospel preached, as by <HI>Noah,</HI> whom the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> calls <HI>A Preacher of Righteousness,</HI> 2 <HI>Peter</HI> 2.5. Likewise, by God himself, who the Apostle <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Gal.</HI> 3.8. <HI>Preached it to</HI> Abraham. And consequently it must be the Gospel that <HI>Noah</HI> preached, for Righteousness, is not of the Law as the Scripture universally testifie. And it is evident that he had no Bible to inform him, or communicate the Knowledge <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of to him; neither had the Prophets <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> after Times, any Dictator, but the Spirit of Christ, which the Apostle saith, <HI>was in them.</HI> And if we look into the Progress of the Bible, since its being compleated, <HI>viz.</HI> since Christ's Appearance upon Earth, visibly, we shall find it confined to a small Part of Mankind, with respect to those who act without it, and among those that act without it; we shall find many who never had an Opportunity of seeing it till lately, particu∣larly the natural Inhabitants of this Continent, on which we now live, could not possibly have seen it till about Two Hundred Years since; And yet it would be contrary to the Bible it self, to pronounce them all damned that died without that Opportunity, for Christ speaking of the <HI>Jews,</HI> John 15.22. <HI>If I
<PB N="8" REF="040110_0005_10162DB5B65725E8"/>
had not come and spoken unto them, they had not had Sin; but now they have no Cloak for their Sin.</HI> and Verse 24. <HI>If I had not done among them, the Works which no other Man did they had not had Sin.</HI> And the Apostle <HI>Paul, Rom.</HI> 4.15. <HI>Where no Law is, there is no Transgression.</HI> So that it will inovitably follow, That the Nations that had no oppor∣tunity of seeing the Scriptures could not have Sin if the Knowledge of Christ is com∣municated by the Scriptures only: But then it will follow, That the same Scriptures that acquits them from Guilt, denys them Salvation, for the Apostle <HI>Peter</HI> saith, <HI>Acts</HI> 4.12. <HI>Neither is there Salvation in any other, for there is none other Name under Heaven given among Men whereby we may be saved.</HI> And Christ, in <HI>John,</HI> 1.36. saith, <HI>He that, believeth on the Son hath everlasting Life, but he be that believeth not on the Son shall not see Life, but the Wrath of God abideth on him.</HI> Therefore it must be granted, That if the Knowledge of Christ be communicated to Mankind by no other Method than by the Scriptures only, That those which have no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> seen the Scriptures could not believe on him and so cannot be saved; and by what hath been said already, it is manifest that they can not be damned; so that these People can neither be saved nor damned, according to the inconsistant Opinion of this Author, Therefore, I am at a loss to know how the
<PB N="9" REF="040110_0005_10162DB5B65725E8"/>
Author would dispose of the greater Part or Mankind, without reviving again the <HI>Papistical Opinion</HI> of a Purgatory.</P>
<P>If the Force of the above Argument be well weighed, it might serve for an effectual Answer to the Authors whole work, since the whole Scope of it tends to lay upon Man∣kind an unnecessary Burthen of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eedless Ordi∣nances, without the Observation of which, or even the Knowledge of the Latter of the Bible it self Salvation may be obtained; and if so, By what Force of Reason? By what Divine Warrant do they confine the Almighty God to particular Methods of Salvation? And such Methods too, as he himself saith he will save no Man by, <HI>viz. An outward Law of Works.</HI> Is it not more agreeable to the Nature of God and the Scope of the Scriptures to conclude with the Apostle <HI>Peter Acts</HI> 10.34, 35. <HI>Of a Truth I perceive God is no respecter of Persons; but in every Nation he that feareth him and worketh Righteousness is accepted with him,</HI></P>
<P>Thus is the Doctrine of Christs being com∣municated to Mankind without humane or external Aid, once and for ever established. And tho' this Gentleman, with others, may think that the unovoidable Consequences of the above Argument may tend to place the Bible a Degree lower in the Esteem of
<PB N="10" REF="040110_0006_10162DB83A7B0DD8"/>
Mankind; but such I must take leave to tell that it is now set in the Place of God, by this Gentleman and his Adherents; for in it we are told That the Spirit of God co∣habits with Just Men as, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 3.16. <HI>Know ye not that ye are the Temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</HI> And if so, Why should we bring the Dictates of so divine an Instructor to the Bible for Proof. In a Word, it is nothing but to arraign God before his Works to prove whether he be God or no.</P>
<P>But the Gentleman is so hardy as to deny that there is any Spirit of God Cohabiting with Mankind, and contemp<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>u<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sly calls it <HI>The Light of Nature,</HI> althouh the Apostle, in <HI>Rom.</HI> 8.9. saith, <HI>But ye are not in the Flesh but in the Spirit, if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you, now if any Man have not the Spirit of Christ, be is none of his.</HI> And in 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> 13.5. <HI>Jesus Christ is in you except you be Reprobates.</HI> And, although the Gentle∣man treats them that contends for the Truth of the aforementioned Scriptures, with so many malicious Aspersions, such as <HI>Enthusiast</HI> and the like: Yet I think it not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> because Malice, Envy and Detraction are the most distinguishing Charactarists of this Gentleman and his Prosel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tes:—And I am sure that the Quakers magnify not their Perfection, as much as this Author
<PB N="11" REF="040110_0006_10162DB83A7B0DD8"/>
doth his Imperfection, in venturing to con∣tradict such known Truths. And I am sorry that the Gentleman could find no properer Object of Scurr<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="4 letters" DISP="••••"/>y and Railery than the Spirit of God. The Gentleman's best Proof for his last Piece of Railery on the Quakers, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s that, That Spirit in one contradicts that in another of his Brethren, and would from hence argue, the Necessity of their coming to be tried by the common Standard, the Bible; but the Success of those that have already made it the Measure of their Faith, may inform us how much nearer we should approach to Certainty, for we have little Encour∣agment to this Method, of Probation, if we consi∣der how many and how different the Expositions which Commentators have made from one and the same Bible are, although all, or most of them, had the best Assistance from Humane Learning. Are they not continually quarrelling one with another? Nay, this Gentleman himself, now preaches up Doctrine that but a few Years ago he condemned. Nay, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>o less than Twice has he shifted his Station, and out of that one corrupt Fountain of his Understanding has issued Waters both bitter and sweet; so I shall leave the Reader to judge of this Gentleman's Title to Infala∣bility.</P>
<P>In Page the 10. We find the Gentleman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ontending for the Lawfulness of War, and

brings. <HI>Luk.</HI> 3.14 to prove it. <HI>And the Soldier likewise, demanded of him, saying, What shal<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> we do? And be said unto them, do Violence <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> no Man, neither accuse any falsly, and be concern with your Wages.</HI> Which he says proves lawful to be Soldiers; but these Soldier will appear to he nothing but the Roma<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Cohorts quartered upon the <HI>Jews,</HI> for th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> more quietly exacting their Tribute: An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the Genleman seems to forget that <HI>Joh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> commanded them to do no Violence, as well as to be content with their Wages; but the<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> could not execute the Office of a Soldie<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without doing Violence <HI>viz.</HI> Exacting from the People that which was not their Due<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> So that <HI>John</HI> in Effect, bid them cease from being Soldiers; and since they were far from acting in definitive War, I admire at the Gentleman for bringing <HI>John</HI> to testifie th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> inhumane Practices of these barbarous Sol∣diers.</P>
<P>Our Authors next Assertion will oblig<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> me to reflect on the natural Consequence of true Religion, which the Gentleman give us in page 8th. of his Book, and admire <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> his Inconsistency with himself, for he saith, "That the Observation of tree Religio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> promotes Love in all Societies, and destroy Malice, Envy, Hatred, <HI>&amp;c."</HI> And if so, would enquire of the Gentleman, from whence those malicious Detractions, and scandalous
<PB N="13" REF="040110_0007_10162DBA9E899C98"/>
Reflections which he throws at the chief Minister of a well established Government proceeds? Not from the Observation of true Religion, by his own Grant: So that I fear the Gentleman by his own Concession cuts himself out of the Right he has to the Character of Religious.</P>
<P>In page <HI>12th.</HI> he saith, That he hath sufficiently proved Salvation by a Christ with∣out us; but I think I have more effectually proved, That if Christ is without him, he is no Christian: So I shall next pass on to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ake notice of his Doctrine of Satisfaction by the Blood of Christ; a Doctrine so con∣trary to the Scriptures, and derogatory from the Honour of God, a Heap of Errors which his Carnal Construction of the Scriptures has led him into, to confute which I shall only with Brevity say that God in proclaiming His Name, <HI>Exod,</HI> 34.6, 7. <HI>And the Lord passed by before him, and proclaimed, the Lord, the Lord God merciful gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in good∣ness and truth, keeping Mercy for Thousands, forgiving Iniquitys and Transgressions,</HI> &amp;c. I say, That here God signifies himself to be a God that can forgive Sin, tho' this Gentle∣man saith he will not, until he has received Satisfaction, which is no Forgiveness at all And would it not likewise follow, That if the Doctrine of the Trinity be true (that
<PB N="14" REF="040110_0008_10162DBD300FD158"/>
is, if the Father and the Son are one) that the Son must make Satisfaction to himself which is absurd; but allowing him to have made Satisfaction, he being one with and o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> the same Nature as the Father, can no mor<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> forgive Sin than the Father: Therefore, the Debt remains as due, both to the Father and Son, they being one, as ever.</P>
<P>But the Gentleman, to prove this Matter conjures up an Argument that he will be puzzled to set aside, although he thinks he has done it, which is, <Q>That it was unjust for Christ, who was Righteous, to suffer for the Wicked;</Q> "the Force of which he pretended∣ly ev<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>des, by saying, That Christ suffered as Surety, and not as Principal; but I ad∣mire at the Gentleman's Weakness for al∣lowing it to be so! It alters not the Case; for if Christ was Righteous, as without doubt he was, it must be contrary to the Scrip<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ues for God to have punished him at all, for in <HI>Prov.</HI> 17.26. <HI>Also to punish the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ust is not g<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>od,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Prov.</HI> 12.28. <HI>In the Way of Righteous∣ness is Life, and in the Path way thereof there is no Death.</HI> and <HI>Prov.</HI> 17.15. <HI>He that justi∣fieth the Wicked, and be that condemned the Just, even they are both Abomination to the Lord.</HI> And as our Author holds, That none but Christ was able to make God Satisfaction for Man's Sin committed in the Fall; and that God demanded Satisfaction, which Satis∣faction
<PB N="15" REF="040110_0008_10162DBD300FD158"/>
Satisfaction must be Punishment: Then it must certainly follow, That God must delight in punishing the Innocent; for, whoever be∣comes Man's Surety must make Satisfaction, and if the Satisfaction be such, That who∣ever makes it must be made infinitly miser∣able; and that God has said, as I have already poved, <HI>That non shall be punished or made miserable by him, but the Wicked.</HI> But his Inno∣cent Son in making Satisfaction is made miserable, and punished by him: It must certainly follow, That Guilt was found on the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnocent Son of God, or, That God has acted contrary to his own Decree, neither of which <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ay be admitted, without allowing the most horrid Blasphemy, and such strange and as∣tonishing Incongruities must unquestionably <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rgue, the most extravigant Degree of In∣justice in the Deity, Blessed for ever more. And so deserves any other Treatment rather <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>han a serious Confutation. Certainly, one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ught to be very well ascertained of the sense of Scripture, before one ventures to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>scert such unreasonable Opinions.</P>
<P>Thus have I abundantly confuted the Doctrine, of those who with this Gentleman <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>present God in so revengeful a Manner <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Mankind, as to say that he cannot forgive an until he has punished this Innocent Son <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Man's Sin. Is not that condemning the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>nnocent acquitting the Guilty? A Prac∣tice
<PB N="16" REF="040110_0009_10162036773A3EA0"/>
whic God so loudly condemns through∣out his whole Word: Is it not to render God so unmercyful and unjust, that rather than forgive the Sin, and mitigate the Punish∣ment, he would chuse to punish the Inno∣cont, and exact the Debt where it was no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> due? Nor doth this Gentleman at all soften it, by making God exact those Sufferings from Man, because he knew none but his Innocent Son must undergo them.</P>
<P>The Gentleman's next Attempt, is to prove That <HI>Water Baptism</HI> and the <HI>Lord's Supper,</HI> a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he calls it, are to be continued in the Christi∣an Church, in order to which he brings a Croud of Scriptures, perverted from thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Genuine Sense: and I perceive, he uses a very ill Method of interperating Scripture For by Transposition, and other unfair Methods he makes the Scripture contradict it sel<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> when he pleases; as for Instance, he brings <HI>Acts</HI> the 3.12, 13. to prove that <HI>Acts</HI> 2.3 is false, for in the Former he saith, <HI>Th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/></HI> Simon <HI>never received the Spiritual Baptism, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was baptized with Water.</HI> And in the Latte<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> he saith, <HI>That Spiritual Baptism is receive<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> by the Conditional Performance of Water Bptism.</HI> 'Tis true he brings in Repentance, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> doubt but <HI>Simon</HI> made an outward Prafess<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of Repentance, which is the Method th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> the Advocates of Water now use. So th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>
<PB N="17" REF="040110_0009_10162036773A3EA0"/>
<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e see this Gentleman pulls down with one <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>and what he builds up with the other.</P>
<P>My intended Brevity in this small Per∣formance, will not suffer me to rescue these <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>orrured Scriptures out of the Hands of this Barberous Expositor: So <HI>I</HI> shall only prove, That they do not intend, that the Use of Water in Baptism, should be perpetuated <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the <HI>Christian Church.</HI> And since the chief Method, by which the Gentleman would <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stablish it is, by joyning it to Spiritual, or Christ's Baptism; I shall prove them seper∣ate first, and that they were continued <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> during the whole Administration, both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Christ and his Apostles.</P>
<P>In order to which, observe that <HI>John</HI> sepera∣ted them in the first of his Ministry, <HI>Luke</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> 16. <HI>I indeed baptize you wich Water; but <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e cometh after me that is mightier than I, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ith Fire.</HI> Which shows an irreconcilable Differ∣ence in them. <HI>viz.</HI> As great as betwixt Water and Fire. John's Baptism likewise, was al∣most Four Years before Christs; for we find one baptized with the Spirit till after Christ's Sufferings, as in <HI>Acts</HI> 1. and that <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey were continued distinct, I prove from <HI>Acts</HI> 19.3. where the same Persons that were <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aptized with <HI>John</HI>'s Baptism, were baptised

again with Christ's Baptism: Where the Apostle himself makes the Distinction between the Baptisms of <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Christ,</HI> which, if they had been joyned, he would not have done. And we find the frequent Appellations o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>John</HI>'s Baptism and <HI>Christ</HI>'s, throughout thei<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> whole Ministry.</P>

Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> without any Warrant from Scripture: An<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> here he makes but one Baptism, both <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>John</HI>'s and <HI>Christ</HI>'s; nevertheless, in Page the <HI>19th</HI> of his Book, he allows of Two no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> in use, <HI>viz.</HI> An <HI>Internal</HI> and <HI>External</HI> one And in this the Gentleman adds to h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Former, another most fatal Mistake, which renders his Writings, The Jest of the <HI>In∣genious</HI> as well as of the <HI>Religious;</HI> for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> saith, <Q>That the Baptisms of <HI>John</HI> and <HI>Christ</HI> make up but one Baptism</Q> And yet <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> says there are Two to be strove for, an performed; but I cannot tell where he wi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> find the Other, without he forms it o<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of his own Brain. Thus we see wh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> miserable Self-Contradictions the Patrons a bad Cause are found to commit.</P>
<P>But the Gentleman would infer anoth<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Argument, for the Use of Water in Baptism
<PB N="19" REF="040110_0010_10162DC48D67B3A0"/>
from Christ's submiting to it: But I shall only make this short Reply, That he may as well argue, the Perpetuity of <HI>Circumcision,</HI> and other Mosaick Ordinances, from Christ's of submitting to them.</P>
<P>But he tells us, That the Apostles prac∣tised it, which is true, tho' not from Christ, but from <HI>John;</HI> for they baptised with water long before the Holy Spirit, or Christ's Baptism was given them; neither <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s it safe to argue from their Practice, for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>n the Minority of the Church, they made great Condesentiens; for we find <HI>Paul</HI> circum∣cised <HI>Timothy,</HI> and <HI>Peter</HI> observed almost all the <HI>Jewish Law,</HI> see, <HI>Gal.</HI> 2.11, 12. So that he may as well enforce almost all the Ceremonies of the <HI>Jewish Law,</HI> from the Practice of the Apostles; as this of Water Baptism.</P>
<P>The Charge given to baptize, in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. Which the Gentleman calls, <HI>The great Com∣mission,</HI> could never intend Water: Because the Apostles would have needed no new Commission to perform that which they had done before, and, That they baptised with Water before, appears from, <HI>John</HI> 4.2. Neither needed they any new Assistance to baptize with Water: But here Christ charged them not to depart from <HI>Jerusalem</HI> until
<PB N="20" REF="040110_0011_10162DC6215A25A0"/>
they were endued with Power from on high, that is, until they were baptised themselves with the Holy Ghost, and not with Water: Therefore, it is obvious to believe, That since they received a new Commission, and new Assistance, they received a new Baptism also; even that Baptism with which they were baptized with themselves, before they could act in this Commission.</P>
<P>But the Gentleman saith, that Baptism cannot be understood as the Quakers de∣fine it; because in the Text aforesaid, <HI>Teach∣ing</HI> and <HI>Baptizing</HI> are both mentioned; but he mistakes the Sense, for if they are both mentioned, yet they are both included in the same Act; for Christ says, <HI>Teach all Nations, baptizing them.</HI> that is, in the Act of Teaching into the Name of the <HI>Father Son</HI> and <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> as the Words are truly rendered, and by the Name of Christ, we are to understand his Power or Authority, as in <HI>Mark</HI> 16. Christ saith, <HI>In my Name ye shall cast out Devils.</HI> That is, in my Pow∣er or Authority: So that without the Gentleman can prove That every Person dipt in Water is baptized into or seasoned with the Power of the <HI>Father Son</HI> and <HI>Holy Ghost,</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e cannot suppose that Christ in that Com∣mission intended Water</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="040110_0011_10162DC6215A25A0"/>
In Page 16, He saith, "That <HI>Paul</HI> enforces the Use of Water," tho' in truth he saith nothing that informs, or as much as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ecommends it, in all his Writings, tho' <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e s;aith much of the Necessity of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>piritual Baptism, for in <HI>Cor.</HI> 12.13. he saith, <HI>That by one sprit we are baptized into one Body.</HI> Neither doth the Gentleman's Comm∣ent upon <HI>Paul</HI>'s own Words argue any Necessity of Water in Baptism; for he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>pposeth the Apostle to be under the most <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ict Cammand of Christ, to administer Water in Baptism, and yet saith, he ne∣glected that Command for fear People should think he did it in his own Name; but I presume, this would hardly have ex∣cused the Apostle, a poor Excuse indeed, That he neglected ore of the most sacred Ordinances of God, for Fear of being <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>censured by a few wicked Men.</P>
<P>He further adds, That <HI>Peter,</HI> under the Conduct of the <HI>Holy Spirit,</HI> baptized with Water; tho' in Fact, the Text saith no such Thing: He produces <HI>Acts</HI> 10.47, 48. <HI>Can any Man forbid Water,</HI> &amp;c. Tho' it is very <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ubious whether he meant material Water; for in Scripture, Water often signifies the <HI>Spirit,</HI> as in <HI>John</HI> 7.38. But allowing it to be meant material Water, The Gentle∣man himself observs, That they were bap∣tized
<PB N="22" REF="040110_0012_10162DC8A2341A80"/>
with the Spirit before; and so, they were holy, as 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 4.16, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> And if holy, consequently Subjects of Sal∣vation, and if Salvation be attained, Wha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> need of outward Ordinances?</P>
<P>In Page 18. He saith, That none beside Christ can baptize with the <HI>Holy Spirit</HI> But I admire at the Extravigancy of th<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> Gentleman's Discourse! He must certain know that the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> was given <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Laying on of the Apostles Hands, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Acts</HI> 8.17. <HI>Then laid they their Hands <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> them, and they received the Holy Ghost.</HI> So that without the Gentleman will allow Christ to be in the Apostles (which will be too grand a Concession for him) he must own himself in the <HI>Wrong.</HI></P>
<P>His next Assertion is equally erronious; for he saith, <HI>That more flockt to</HI> Christ <HI>than to</HI> John, <HI>by reason of his Fame of baptizing with the Spirit.</HI> Although it appears by <HI>Acts</HI> 1. That none was baptized with the Spirit till after Christ's Sufferings; neither can he produce one Testimony to support his Argument in all the Scriptures: So that I cannot but admire at the Gentleman Immodisty, in venturing to publish such bold untruths to the World.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="040110_0012_10162DC8A2341A80"/>
All which must certainly confound the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>entleman's Argument for using Water Bap∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sm: He might, with a better Assent <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>om the Scriptures, use Fire; for Christ's <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>aptism is said to be with Fire, more early than with Water. And if we con∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>er (that allowing the Apostles to have <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed Water, visible Gifts of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>tended on them to witness the Truth of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>eit <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>) the Advocates of Water <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ave little Right to practice it from them, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Why would they retain the Shadow, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> God has disowned their Ministry, by <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>enying them the Substance? For after all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Washings in Water, and laying on <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Hands, they were never able to confer <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e visible Gifts of the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> on one of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>heir Proselytes. And if God had intended <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hey should ha<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e used it still, no doubt but he would have continued the same priviledges to them as to the Apostles; <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or Christ makes no Reserve in <HI>Mat.</HI> 28. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>here he promises to be with the Apostles <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the End of the World, in their Suc∣cessors; and therefore, the Gentleman may with as good Reason, press the Performances of the Ordinances that He mentions; such <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> making <HI>Clay,</HI> and anointing the Eyes of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>e Blind: I say, he may as well admi∣nister that Ordinance to a blind Man, and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> him, it is a Help to the Recovery of

his Sight, as to dip a Convert in Wate<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> and tell him he is ever the nearer being baptized with the <HI>Holy Spirit.</HI></P>
<P>Some also add, That a Promise of Sal∣vation is annexed to Water Baptism <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> but I deny that there is any such Promis<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to VVater Baptism only; although ther<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> is almost to every Grace of the Spirit, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> <HI>Faith,</HI> by which the Apostle saith, <HI>We ar<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> saved.

<P>The Gentleman saith so little to the Purpose, in his Attempt to enforce the Use of <HI>Bread</HI> and <HI>Wine</HI> in the <HI>Church,</HI> That I think it not worth answering it. True he brings the Apostle, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 11.23, 24.

<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Christ our Passover is sacrificed for <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>. Therefore let us keep the Feast, not with old Leaven,</HI> &amp;c. And if the Gentleman would allow of the same Spiritual Ob∣servation of the Supper, as of the Passover, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> would joyne with him, which he cannot help granting, without making the same Apostle contradict himself; for in <HI>Colos.</HI> 2.20. he <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/>, <HI>Wherefore, if ye be dead with Christ, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>rom the Rudiments of the World; Why, as <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>ough living in the World, are ye subject to <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>dinances,</HI></P>
<P>So that I shall hast to a Conclusion, and joyne with the Gentleman, in enforcing <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> constant Use of the Bible; but with <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Caution of the Apostles, 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> 2.11. <HI>For what Man knoweth the Things of a Man, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the Spirit Man?
