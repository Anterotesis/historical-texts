<HEAD>AN ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>WHOEVER admits the <HI>moral</HI> Perfections and universal Providence of <HI>Almighty God,</HI> must ne∣cessarily grant that the Majesty of his Govern∣ment, and the Honor of his Laws, require that signal Trespasses should be signally corrected When these Trespasses are of a private Nature, their full Punish∣ment is often referred to another World; but when the Guilt is public and <HI>national,</HI> the Punishment of it must be <HI>national</HI> also. For it is only in this World that whole Nations can be punished as such, since in the World to come, all lesser Societies or Combina∣tions of Men, that are entred into here, will be for ever dissolved.</P>
<P>Both Sacred and Profane History bears Testimony to the remark∣able Judgments that have been poured down upon Guilty Nations. Some have kissed the Rod of the Almighty, and humbled them∣selves before the <HI>Lord their Maker;</HI> and he has <HI>returned and repented, and left a Blessing behind him.</HI> But others have hardened their Faces, and refused all Correction; and have therefore been given up to entire Ruin and Desolation. For there is a Time when the Pati∣ence of the Almighty has had its full Work, and when the Measure of a People's Iniquity is compleat, so that nothing remains but a <HI>fearful looking for Judgment, and fiery Indignation!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="007606_0003_102BA7F3E0A75448"/>
It has been the Practice of the wisest Nations of all Ages, to set apart particular Times to be kept holy for particular Purposes. And whoever allows SOCIAL WORSHIP to be a Duty, and the devoting one Day in Seven to adore the <HI>Lord our Maker, publickly and in the great Congregation,</HI> for the common Benefits which we daily receive, and to pray for Forgiveness of the common Trespasses which we daily commit;—I say, whoever allows this to be a Duty, must like∣wise allow it to be an indispensible Duty for a People to set apart and keep holy particular Times, either of <HI>Thanksgiving</HI> or <HI>Humiliation,</HI> as often as they receive any particular Deliverance, or are threat∣ened with any particular Punishment or Judgment. And as it is the Business of those who watch over the Welfare of the State to point out and enjoin the Seasons proper for such Purposes; so it is the Duty of every Individual of the Community, to observe the same with all becoming Reverence and Solemnity.</P>
<P>Of this Nature was the <HI>general</HI> FAST appointed to be kept holy by all his Majesty's loving Subjects in this Province and three <HI>Lower Counties,</HI> on the 21st of <HI>May</HI> last, being the same Day on which a like Fast was appointed in one of the Neighbouring Pro∣vinces. Certainly, if ever any People had a more immediate Call to humble themselves before the LORD JEHOVAH, it was our Duty so to do, upon that solemn Occasion; when our joint Thanksgi∣vings were to be offered up at the <HI>Footstool of Omnipotence,</HI> for a most remarkable Deliverance from wide-spreading Earthquakes, which had laid several Cities level with the Dust; and when all that is dear and valuable to us, as <HI>Britons</HI> and as <HI>Protestants,</HI> was to be the Subject of our united Prayers and Supplications. To be convinced of this we need only to read the GOVERNOR's excellent Procla∣mation, which is delivered in a Stile so truly pathetic, affecting and solemn, that one would imagine it might have roused the most Hardened, and overcome the most Obstinate. In the Preamble it sets forth the Reasons of the said FAST, as follows;</P>
<P><Q>THAT it is often the Method of God's Providence, for the Glory of his Name, and the Maintenance of true Holiness, gra∣ciously to visit his People for their Sins, and in a more solemn
<PB N="5" REF="007606_0004_102BA7F56E7923F8"/>
Manner to call them to Repentance by awakening Judgments from Heaven, which, if neglected or contemned, render such a People still more obnoxious to the divine Displeasure:—That at this present Time, the Judgments of the Lord seem visibly to be abroad upon the Earth, whose habitable Parts have been almost universally agitated with frequent and most dreadful <HI>Earthquakes,</HI> great Cities in divers Places being overturned to their Foundations, many Thousands of their Inhabitants whelmed in the Ruins, and Wars, and Rumours of Wars, with Sin and Wickedness, nevertheless extensively prevailing:—That our gracious Sovereign on the <HI>British</HI> Throne, touched with a deep Sense of these Things, and a thorough Concern for the Glory of God, and the Prosperity of his Dominions, was pleased to appoint and com∣mand a Day of public <HI>Fasting, Prayer</HI> and <HI>Supplication,</HI> and to hallow that Day by his royal Example, rising from the Throne like the King of <HI>Nineveh,</HI> and humbling himself in the Dust, together with his good Subjects, in one grand and solemn Act of Devotion before the <HI>Lord of Lords, and King of Kings,</HI> most fervently imploring the adorable Majesty of Heaven <HI>to avert just Judgments from us, to continue his Mercies towards us, to perpetuate the Enjoyment of the Protestant Religion, and to protect and bless our Fleets and Armies:</HI>—That the Imitation of such an illustrious Pattern of <HI>Humiliation</HI> and <HI>Devotion,</HI> was not only our indispen∣sible Duty, on so awful and interesting an Occasion; as we are Subjects to the best of Kings, and equally concern'd with o∣thers of his faithful Subjects in the general Safety and Prosperity of his Dominions, but especially as the Province which we inha∣bit is at this Time particularly visited with the murdering Sword of a savage Enemy, a considerable Part of it being already laid waste by their bloody Ravages; great Numbers of our unhappy Fellow-Subjects cruelly murdered, or carried into barbarous Captivity, and the ensuing Summer opening a Prospect that seems big with the Fate of these Colonies, and more nearly interesting their su∣ture Safety than any Period which they have ever yet beheld.</Q></P>
<P>Nor were the Ends proposed by this FAST less affecting than the awful Occasion of it. For the Proclamation goes on to declare
<PB N="6" REF="007606_0005_102BA7F7DC89F820"/>
that it was designed for a Day <Q>Of general <HI>Humiliation</HI> before the Lord our God, that we might with one Heart and Voice, in the most solemn and devout Manner, send up our united Prayers and Supplications to the Throne of Grace and Mercy, through the unspeakable Merits and Intercession of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, <HI>for the Forgiveness both of our private and nati∣onal Sins; for averting the Punishments justly due to them; for Refor∣mation and Amendment of Manners; for Harmony and public Spirit in all our Transactions; for a Blessing upon his Majesty's Arms employed in the Defence of our just Rights both by Sea and Land; for Consolation and Redress to our suffering Brethren and Neighbours; for a speedy de∣liverance from our cruel and blood-thirsty Enemies; and for continuing among us, and spreading abroad to the remotest Parts of this dark Conti∣nent, the inestimable Blessings of</HI> British <HI>Liberty, and the pure Light of the Protestant Religion, as it is in Christ Jesus, equally reformed from vain Superstition and giddy Enthusiasm.</HI></Q></P>
<P>These were the great Ends of this Fast; and certainly none were ever more becoming a Government to enjoin, or a People to comply with. For there is scarce a single Thing worthy of our Care in this Life, <HI>as a Society of dependent Creatures,</HI> which is not comprized under some one of the foregoing Heads.—And, On! what a glorious Prospect it would have been, to have beheld two or three Provinces, without one dissenting Voice, humbling them∣selves before a <HI>Heart-searching God</HI> for such important Purposes, and throwing themselves at the <HI>precious</HI> REDEEMER'S <HI>Feet</HI> for Mercy and Favor. One may safely affirm, that there is not, among <HI>all the Works of the Almighty,</HI> a Prospect that would have been more pleasing to him than such an Appearance of his repenting and re∣turning Creatures But alas! the Harmony of the finest Instru∣ment may be interrupted and marred by one peevish and jarring String! In order to have given such an Appearance its full Beau∣ty and Lustre, it ought to have been universal, and without Ex∣ception; for as every Member of the Community has added to the general Guilt, so every Member ought likewise to have joined in the general Humiliation. And for any Sett of Men to oppose their stubborn Wills to the Sense of a Community, and to do all
<PB N="7" REF="007606_0006_102BA7FACC240070"/>
in their Power to prevent that general-Blessing which the <HI>Lord</HI> has promised to such a general Act of Devotion, thereby involving o∣thers in the fatal Effects of their Obstinacy;—I say, for any Sett of Men to act thus, is a Degree of Baseness for which I have no Name. Good Men have Reason to think it their Misfortune to be connected in the same Society with such perverse Persons, and heartily to mourn because they are constrained to <HI>sojourn in Mesech, and to dwell in the Tents of Kedar!</HI></P>
<P>Such was the Perverseness of the People called <HI>Quakers</HI> on the late <HI>solemn Fast.</HI> And Notwithstanding all the aforesaid Conside∣rations, and the express Order of the Government,—<Q>re∣quiring the said Fast to be religiously kept by all his Majesty's loving Subjects within this Province and Counties, of whatsoe∣ver Denomination, as they tendered their own temporal and eter∣nal Welfare, and would not be deemed wanting in the <HI>univer∣sal Duties</HI> of GRATITUDE to their <HI>adorable Maker,</HI> AFFECTION for their <HI>gracious Sovereign,</HI> COMPASSION for their suffering Bre∣thren, and <HI>Regard</HI> for their own IMMEDIATE SAFETY;</Q> yet most of them in this City, as well as in the Country, refused to pay the least Regard to the Day, but were rather more busy than usual in pursuing their temporal Callings, and grasping at the vile Dross of this World!</P>
<P>Early on the Morning of the said Day, the MAYOR of this City being informed, that many of the said <HI>Quakers,</HI> neither restrain∣ed by Decency to their Neighbours, nor moved by the calamitous Situation of their Country, were obstinately employed in servile Labor, sent the following Warrant directed to the Constables of the City, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<P>THIS Day being by Order of His Honour the GOVERNOR appointed to be religiously kept, and all Persons being re∣quired to abstain from servile Labor throughout this Province; you are hereby directed to go through the several Wards of this City, and if you find any Persons at Work, you are to acquaint him of this Order; and if they are so indiscreet as to open their

<P>In Consequence of this Warrant the Constables returned the Names of 61 Heads of Families, all <HI>Quakers</HI> in this City who were found employed in Opposition to this Order of Government. Their Power and Numbers will no Doubt screen them from the Punishment which might justly be inflicted upon such Obstinacy and Contempt. But they shall not escape that Censure which the <HI>PRESS,</HI> and EVERY GOOD MAN ought to pronounce against them. It was once intended to add the Names of the Offenders in this Place, that the Innocent might not suffer with the Guilty; for it is but Justice to confess, that some of the most rational and sensible <HI>Quakers</HI> of this City were not among the Number, and who, if they did not go to any Place of Worship, yet thought it their Duty not to give any Offence to their Fellow-Citizens, and kept their Houses shut up accordingly. But these were only a few in Comparison to the Number of Offenders. Nevertheless, as they are sufficiently known, I shall spare filling up my Paper with their Names; and shall only observe, that among the rest were three Members of the present Assembly residing in this City, who were the Foremost to follow their worldly Callings, and to refuse joining in public Prayers to <HI>Almighty God</HI> for the Preservation of that HOLY PROTESTANT RELIGION AND CIVIL LIBERTY, whereof they are the <HI>pretended</HI> CONSERVATORS.</P>
<P>I shall not pass that Censure on these People which they deserve. I consign them over to the Public, and to the Censure contained in

the following <HI>Monitor,</HI> published against the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> for not observing the late Fast appointed by his Majesty in that Place. As it comes from a Writer of the highest Reputation, and most approved Abilities, it will be far superior to any Thing I could say on the Subject; and therefore I shall conclude my Part of this Publication with a few <HI>Queries</HI> to <HI>Quakers.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. Whether they believe in the absolute Perfections and wise Providence of the supreme God?</P>
<P N="2">2. Whether they believe He makes no Distinction between Vir∣tue and Vice, Obedience and Disobedience to his holy Laws?</P>
<P N="3">3. Whether every Member of this Community, <HI>Quakers</HI> as well as others, have not <HI>sinned,</HI> and in many Cases come short of the Duty which they owe to such an <HI>adorable Being?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. Whether when the Offence is <HI>publick and national,</HI> our Re∣pentance and Humiliation ought not to be <HI>public and national also?</HI></P>
<P N="5">5 Whether, when a particular Season is appointed for such Pur∣poses, and a great Majority come chearfully and readily to humble themselves at their <HI>Maker's Feet,</HI> a few have any Right to oppose themselves to the Sense of said Majority, to disturb them in such a solemn and necessary Act of Devotion, and thereby to prevent, as far as they can, the obtaining of those public Blessings, which the Lord has graciously promised to public Repentance and Reforma∣tion?</P>
<P N="6">6. Whether Persons who act thus are not to be considered as E∣nemies to their Country, and to those invaluable Enjoyments which we are called, to <HI>pray</HI> for the Preservation of, upon such solemn Oc∣casions?</P>
<P N="7">7. Whether the <HI>Quakers</HI> were not more immediately concerned than others to pray for the Relief of our bleeding and suffering Country, from that Distress and Confusion, wherein their particular Obstinacy and absurd Principles of Government have involved us?</P>
<P N="8">8. Whether Men who thus despise every Ordinance of the <HI>Powers that be,</HI> and seem unconcerned at the Sufferings of their Fellow-Ci∣tizens, as well as the Visitations of their ALMIGHTY CREATOR, are fit to receive any civil Trust, either as Magistrates, or as our Repre∣sentatives, and Guardians of that <HI>Liberty</HI> and holy Religion which they refuse to join in imploring the <HI>Supreme Being</HI> for the Continu∣ance of?</P>
<P N="9"><PB N="10" REF="007606_0009_102BA801CDFB7F90"/>
9. Whether they have not incurred the highest Disgrace by their late Administration of this Province?</P>
<P N="10">10. Whether their Conduct has not been so obnoxious to the <HI>British</HI> Nation, that they were lately deemed by his Majesty and his Ministers to have forfeited all Right to civil Offices, as maintain∣ing Principles diametrically opposite to the Nature of an <HI>English Government,</HI> and to the <HI>Rights</HI> and <HI>Honor</HI> of his Majesty's <HI>Crown?</HI></P>
<P N="11">11. Whether the <HI>Quakers</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> in Order to prevent the extending of a Test <HI>for the total Exclusion of their Friends here from all Places of public Trust,</HI> have not engaged as it were <HI>Body for Body, that their said Friends the Quakers of this Province will for the future de∣cline meddling in public Matters, and behave more</HI> dutifully <HI>to their So∣vereign,</HI> that his just Rights may be recovered, and Peace and Happiness secured for his good Subjects in these Colonies?</P>
<P N="12">12. Whether the obstinate Refusal of the <HI>Quakers here</HI> to keep the <HI>late Fast,</HI> was consistent with this Duty to their Sovereign, and the Promise so lately made for them by their Friends in <HI>England?</HI></P>
<P N="13">13. Whether giving out in Mr. <HI>Bradford's</HI> Journal, No. 703. that only a Majority of <HI>Quakers</HI> have engaged to resign for a little Time, and that they are to <HI>resume</HI> their Seats when the present Trou∣bles are over, is not a plain Proof that they intend to evade the Promise made for them, and to continue in their Obstinacy till they incur a severer Censure?</P>
<P N="14">14. Whether it is not the highest Insolence in them to talk of suf∣fering other Denominations to come into the Assembly to extricate the Province from the Distress into which <HI>Quakers</HI> have involved it, and that when the Storm is over, the said <HI>Quakers</HI> will resume the Helm, and send those others about their Business?</P>
<P N="15">15. Whether any Persons of Spirit or Reputation would serve in Assembly upon such dishonorable Terms? And whether those who are not fit to govern in Time of <HI>War,</HI> can be sit in Time of <HI>Peace,</HI> seeing it is the great Business of <HI>Peace</HI> to prevent, or provide against, <HI>War?</HI></P>
<P N="16">16. Whether all these Things put together do not prove that a <HI>Quaker</HI> will be continually the same perverse, self-will'd, deceitful Thing that is so well described in the following MONITOR?</P>

<HEAD><HI>The</HI> MONITOR, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Published in <HI>London,</HI> February 14. 1756. <HI>To the</HI> MONITOR.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE subject of the following paper, tho' I cannot rank it entire∣ly among the political, is of so interesting a nature, in regard to the welfare of the state, that I doubt not of your acceptance and readiness to communicate the same to whom it may concern.</P>
<P>THE awful end interesting occasion of the late general fast, which our gracious sovereign commanded to be observed RELIGIOUSLY by ALL his loving subjects, was enforced under these most solemn and awakening conditions: <HI>As they tender'd the favour of Almighty</HI> GOD, <HI>and upon pain of suffering</HI> temporal <HI>punishment,</HI> should they be found so irreligious and refractory as to <HI>contemn</HI> or <HI>neglect the performance of so religious and necessary a duty.</HI> A fast, as his majesty expressed him∣self, not only to adore the Almighty for being <HI>our defence in time of danger,</HI> and for having <HI>protected and preserved us from imminent destructi∣on</HI> of EARTHQUAKES; but also to implore the divine blessing and as∣sistance in the present situation of PUBLIC AFFAIRS; whose <HI>issue</HI> is of <HI>the highest importance to the peace and safety of these kingdoms, to our com∣merce and liberties,</HI> and, above all, to the most valuable blessing of the <HI>Protestant religion:</HI> I say this awful and interesting occasion, en∣forced in so pathetic and powerful a manner from the throne, persua∣ded me that the <HI>fast</HI> of <HI>Nineveh</HI> would be renewed in the <HI>British Capital.</HI></P>
<P>IT was great satisfaction to every religious heart, and no less plea∣sing to those, who pay a just regard to the powers in being, and sincerely desire the blessings of peace and of the Protestant religion, to see this Fast observed with that solemn and Christian deprotment in all our churches; as the cause thereof required. Where majesty appeared arrayed with the brightest lustre before the King of Kings: and both houses of parliament never shone more illustrious, than, at thus solemnity, before the altar. No age, nor condition; no party, nor Religion pretended to be exempt from this universal obligation.
<PB N="12" REF="007606_0011_102BA80572D12F90"/>
The <HI>Papists, Dissenters</HI> of all Denominations, the <HI>Methodists,</HI> and even the <HI>Jews</HI> solemnized the day with acts of humiliation and works of <HI>mercy.</HI></P>
<P>The courts of judicature were silent: no cause was that day plead∣ed but the national Protection before the Lord. The public offices, the customs, the excise, the exchange, and the very exchequer were not open: the merchants, the manufacturers, the tradesmen and la∣bourers; nay the very common soldiers were impressed with such a sense of their <HI>Christian calling</HI> to <HI>obey</HI> the <HI>royal authority,</HI> commanding them <HI>to cease from all worldly employments, and to exercise their Christian pofession by fasting and prayer,</HI> that not only <HI>the markets were adjourned, the shops, nay the very stews and brothels were shut up; but in this most popu∣lous city, I am told, there was no appearance of any worldly traffic, except amongst a sett of people, distinguished by the name of</HI> Quakers.</P>
<P>If this be true, <HI>Mr. Monitor!</HI> what idea must <HI>foreign nations</HI> con∣ceive of a state that <HI>tolerates</HI> a people, who run <HI>counter</HI> to the greatest examples; and <HI>disobey</HI> the <HI>authority,</HI> by which they are <HI>protected?</HI> what <HI>jealousies</HI> does it create in our minds to be <HI>connected</HI> with a people that will neither <HI>obey their God,</HI> nor <HI>their king!</HI> had the <HI>Jews</HI> opened their shops, and <HI>frequented</HI> their daily <HI>labor,</HI> would it not have been <HI>interpreted</HI> a <HI>contempt of a Christian ordinance?</HI> had the <HI>Pa∣pists</HI> and <HI>Nonjurors</HI> made it <HI>a day of pleasure and entertainment,</HI> would not they have been deservedly branded with <HI>disaffection?</HI> had the <HI>Methodists</HI> neglected this necessary duty, under a <HI>vain pretence</HI> of a <HI>more perfect way</HI> to appease the <HI>wrath of God,</HI> and to <HI>intercede for his protection and aid;</HI> would they not have <HI>incurred the censure of all well wishers to our happy establishment both in church and state?</HI></P>
<P>WHAT then can be urged in defence of these Quakers, who in contempt of his majesty's proclamation; in opposition to the universal abstinance from lucrative and worldly employs, and un∣moved at the imminent destruction from which the Almighty has preserved us, and which our enemies are contriving to bring upon this nation, were the only subjects that appeared insensible of the public danger, or not desirous of the public good?</P>
<P>IT is unscriptural to suppose any one can serve both God and Mammon. And can they be said to serve the Lord in fasting, and
<PB N="13" REF="007606_0012_102BA806F6941390"/>
weeping and praying, who at the time of public calamities, and general mourning, are taken up in their daily practices of acquiring the riches of this world only? and it is very near boarding upon rebellion, not to comply with such regulations of a government, as are calculated for God's glory and the public safety.</P>
<P>There can be no great expectation of loyalty and religion from a people, who are deaf to the voice of their sovereign; and prefer the advantages of this world, and their peculiar humour or inven∣tions, to the interest we ought to seek in God by fasting and pray∣er; and to the example of the great, the learned, and the devout.</P>
<P>What could an earthly prince say more to engage all his sub∣jects to accompany him to the footstool of the Almighty, than to declare that the reason of his proclaiming a <HI>general</HI> and <HI>public</HI> fast, was, that both he and his people, might <HI>humble themselves before Al∣mighty God, and in a most devout and solemn manner, send up</HI> their <HI>pray∣ers and supplications to the divine Majesty, to avert just judgments, to con∣tinue his mercies, to perpetuate the enjoyment of the Protestant religion a∣mong us, and safety and prosperity to these kingdoms and dominions; and to implore his protection and blessing upon our fleets and armies.</HI> Was there any token of humiliation amongst the <HI>Quakers?</HI> where was their devotion? in what manner did they keep the fast? instead of pray∣ers and supplications to the Divine Majesty, they were labouring <HI>for the Mammon of unrighteousness.</HI> Neither decency towards their neighbours, nor regard for their king; nor yet the terrors of the Lord, which are abroad upon the earth, could work upon their stubborn, unruly, and hardened hearts. Their shop was their Temple! and their gain was their God!</P>
<P>Is it not a shocking circumstance to be connected with a people that are neither to be moved by judgments, nor engaged by mer∣cies, to perform acts of devotion, and to pray for the welfare of the society, whereunto they belong? can there be any credit given to their future professions in favour of the Protestant religion, who refused on this solemn occasion to pray for its perpetuity among us? does not such a behaviour countenance the suspicion that <HI>Quakerism</HI> is continued by the same jesuitical policy, with which it was first broached in this island? and that it has not cleared itself of the blasphemy for which <HI>George Fox,</HI> their patriarch was punished?</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="007606_0013_102BA80A6B3A92F8"/>
Is not there reason to suspect the loyalty, as well as religion, of a people, who would not in a <HI>devout and solemn manner,</HI> humble themselves and send up their prayers and supplications by the com∣mand and example of their king, to the Divine Majesty, for the safety and prosperity of his kingdoms and dominions? and does not any evasion or equivocation to excuse their contempt, or neglect of so <HI>religious</HI> and <HI>necessary</HI> a duty, as at this time, to implore the Almighty's <HI>protection and blessing upon our fleets and armies,</HI> call aloud upon the government to examine into those principles, upon which they pretend to maintain such absurd and dangerous doctrines, and what, in other subjects, would be justly suspected of disaffecti∣on, and a ripeness to join in the first act of rebellion? not to pray <HI>for our fleets and armies</HI> is the next step to <HI>refusing</HI> the necessary taxes to maintain them; which, according to our information from <HI>Ame∣rica,</HI> is already the case, where these <HI>Quakers think they can act with impunity:</HI> and there is no step between such a <HI>refusal,</HI> and the <HI>betray∣ing</HI> of their country to the first invader.</P>
<P>Yet these are the people who have been in many instances distin∣guished by the royal favour! and in many particulars permitted by the legislature to enjoy privileges denied to their <HI>fellow-subjects:</HI> whose conscience will not permit them to take an oath! and whose plea is for the <HI>spirit of Christianity,</HI> and <HI>for the light within!</HI></P>
<P>I shall only beg leave to ask whether you think a people who have a Right to seek for the protection of their Property and lives, are not obliged to submit to the <HI>ordinances</HI> of <HI>that power</HI> by <HI>whom they are protected,</HI> when those <HI>ordinances</HI> do not clash with <HI>the commandments of God,</HI> nor with the <HI>liberties of the subject?</HI> whether the measure <HI>of a subject's obedience</HI> is not to be <HI>confined</HI> within the limits of the law? whether it is not more criminal in <HI>foro conscientiae</HI> to <HI>forfeit</HI> our alle∣giance by an <HI>obstinate refractoriness</HI> to the command <HI>of a supreme go∣vernor,</HI> than to take an Oath in a judicial way <HI>for the confirmation of a truth?</HI> whether the spirit of Christianity is more visible <HI>in wearing a broad-brim'd hat, a plain coat, or a green apron;</HI> than in the outward forms of humiliation, and other positive institutions in the Christian church? or whether that <HI>light within,</HI> the <HI>plus ultra</HI> of all enthusiasts, who have so many innovations to patronize under that presumption, is not a <HI>perverse</HI> ambitious <HI>passion,</HI> which delights in singularity, and

sacrifices every consideration both human and divine to an un∣meaning obstinacy?</P>
<P>But what can be expected from a people, who, under the plea of being guided by the spirit, reject the two sacraments of Christ's own institution; and who are, as far as they do so, <HI>unworthy the Name of Christians?</HI> who screening their unjustifiable proceedings under the sacred name of conscience and toleration, <HI>make use of liberty as a cloak to cover their impiety and disobedience.</HI> For no one can plead the act of toleration for doctrines, tenets and deeds which tend to the overthrow of religion and the authority of that government, under which he lives. And I can harbour but a very contemptible opinion of them, whose chief pride lies in <HI>an obstinate perseverance in their own inventions, and in opposition to all other institutions both ecclesiastic and civil.</HI></P>
<P>This is very distant from the real spirit of Christ and of his disci∣ples; which is <HI>to give Cesar his due, to obey those that are in authority, to submit to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake, to mourn with them that mourn, to fast and pray lest we enter into temptation,</HI> and not to confine the <HI>light</HI> as in a dark lanthorn, but to <HI>let it so shine before men, that they may see our good works, and glorify our Father which is in Heaven.</HI></P>
<P>It is not the place of a <HI>Monitor</HI> to punish; but to exert all his faculties with a view to deter evil-doers from proceeding in their wickedness, and to reclaim those, whose hearts are not already gi∣ven up to a reprobate sense. Therefore, as in the midst of Judg∣ment, it is the Christian spirit to shew mercy, where there appears any token of repentance and amendment; I do not persuade you to sound the trumpet of persecution; a term which these <HI>Quakers</HI> have made use of with great success to extort extraordinary privile∣ges from the clemency of the state: but, as a friend to society, and an enemy to no person, I believe that it can be no breach of christi∣an charity, nor any force upon a Christian conscience, to call them to a remembrance of their duty to <HI>fear God,</HI> and to <HI>honour the King;</HI> and to ask them, how they can reconcile their contempt or neglect of the religious observance of the late fast, with that authority; which in the most solemn manner, for their present and eternal welfare, called upon them, and enjoined it, as they tender the favour of Almighty God; and upon pain of suffering the pu∣nishment, as they deserve, who resist or contemn the powers, <HI>or∣dained</HI>

<HI>of God for the punishment of evil doers?</HI> HAD the occasion al∣ledged been confined only to the mournful object of <HI>earthquakes,</HI> which have wrought so great destruction abroad, and visited seve∣ral parts of the British dominions, humanity, the bowels of Chri∣stian compassion, and a true sense of God's mercy, which has so wonderfully protected and preserved us from imminent destruction, should have produced some religious acts towards our Maker; but when the precarious situation of our public national affairs; when our peace, safety, commerce, liberties, and the very light of the gospel where also made a necessary part of the duty, <HI>What shame must they take to themselves, who contemn'd or neglected so in∣teresting and important an act of religion!</HI>—Is not this a specimen of that spirit, which has so lately reduced <HI>Pennsylvania</HI> to the <HI>brink of de∣struction,</HI> exposed the country to the common enemy, and deserted their <HI>Protestant neighbours</HI> to be cruelly butcher'd by the knives of savage <HI>Indians?</HI> ALL then that I would have proposed to re∣form this evil spirit, is, that they shall either confess their abhor∣ence of their late disobedience and contempt of the royal pro∣clamation, and promise their future strict comformity to such or∣dinances of the state, from which they are not excused by the law; or that his majesty will be pleased to <HI>maintain the honour and dignity of his crown,</HI> the <HI>force of his laws,</HI> and the <HI>dignity of the Christian name among protestants,</HI> by inflicting such punishment, as he may justly do, upon all such as have contemned or neglected the per∣formance of the late religious and necessary duty of fasting. For it is in vain to shelter a <HI>contempt of the laws,</HI> under the <HI>act of tolerati∣on.</HI> An act designed to <HI>prevent persecution for religion,</HI> in such cases as the state acknowledg'd to be indifferent: but not to countenance every <HI>irreligious, factious, and rebellious doctrine,</HI> which the <HI>enthusiasts, uncristian</HI> and <HI>republican</HI> teachers, might invent and introduce from time to time.</P>
<P>So far I can venture to affirm, <HI>that these worldly-minded people can find no plea for there obstinancy, and disobedience,</HI> in scripture; and that there don't want examples to shew the confusion and damage, which have ensued to the state, by yielding to, or conniving at those, who <HI>plead conscience for rebellion,</HI> and <HI>reject</HI> all authority, that <HI>interferes</HI> with their <HI>unruly</HI> passions.</P>
