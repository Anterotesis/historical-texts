<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="part">
<HEAD>I. <HI>INTRODUCTION:</HI> Containing a true State of the Matters judged upon by the late <HI>Con∣sociation,</HI> from their Rise until laid before that venerable Body.</HEAD>
<P>FROM the time of my first settling with the people in <HI>West-Stafford,</HI> (which was October 31, 1764) until the year 1778, I lived as happily with them as any Minister upon the Continent with his people, perhaps: I loved the people, and to serve their best interest in public and private, in sickness and health, was my delightful employ; while I received, in return, many testimonies of their cordial and sincere regard to me, and for the truth's sake which I preached unto them; which, in many instances, appeared to have a good effect upon them: On which ac∣count I had reason to rejoice that I had not
<PB N="6" REF="016775_0005_0F9E23E7E7A70FE0"/>
run in vain, nor laboured in vain among them.</P>
<P>In 1778 my salary, which according to agreement was sixty pounds lawful money annually, by the depreciation of Continental money, was become almost nothing; so that I found myself obliged to ask for some al∣lowance to be made me. In March 1778, a meeting of the society was called to see if they would afford me any help. At this time those who were betrusted with the prudenti∣als of the society were chiefly strangers, new∣ly come to reside in the place, and by ren∣dering themselves popular had got into places of trust: An error this in the people which I would caution all other societies against. The Committee opposed any thing's being done for me in a parish way; that which they chiefly urged, was that it would op∣press the poor, &amp;c.—The society, which had been used to peace before, seemed much surprised to see a fire kindled; and to put out the same, a number of the principal in∣habitants proposed to me, at the time of the meeting, to accept of a subscription for that year, to which I consented in case it were adequate; to bring this about they desired an adjournment of the meeting, which was granted. At the adjourned meeting I signified my acceptance of what was subscribed, and so the difficulty seemed to subside for the pre∣sent.
<PB N="7" REF="016775_0006_0F9E23E8950FB558"/>
Nevertheless I could often hear of the Committee's telling one and another, that it was unreasonable to allow me any more than the nominal sum, and whatever they did more was over and above their contract with me; that they were under no obligation to do it, and the like. Towards the close of this year, the Committee, without being de∣sired by me, came to my house and told me, they understood that I was uneasy with my sa∣lary and wanted some help from the people; and as there would be business enough on the annual meeting without that, they thought it best, if I was willing, to have a meeting called on purpose to settle the matter relative to my salary. I told them I was willing if they tho't best, and had mentioned it to one of them some time before, that I had thoughts of desiring an interview with the Committee; they then asked me, what my request was? I told them that they knew the whole affair as well as I, a bare support was all I asked for; I was willing to bear an equal part of the burdens of the present day, and would give up one quarter of my salary, if the parish would make the rest good, giving me forty-five pounds as good as it used to be. One of them, upon this, asked me how I would have the warn∣ing drawn? I told him that it was not my business to make warnings, they knowing the affair, were quite able to do that. Another
<PB N="8" REF="016775_0007_0F9E23E960CB10B8"/>
spoke and said, we must warn the society to come together, to see what addition they would make to the salary. I told them I thought it not proper to talk of addition to the salary, when I offered to give up one quarter of it. They told me that sixty pounds was sixty pounds, and if the society paid that, they fulfilled their agreement with me, and if they allowed me any more it would be by way of addition. I asked them, if they thought sixty pounds Continental money was equivalent to the society's agreement with me? They told me they thought it was: and two of them said they should never hold up their hands for my having any more, and added that they believed that the greater part of the parish was of their minds: The other said, it did not belong to them to determine the matter, the parish might do as they saw fit. I told them that if the society was of their minds, I should be glad to know it, that I might know what to do, and accord∣ingly desired a meeting; they therefore warn∣ed a meeting to see what the society would <HI>add</HI> to my salary. I wrote to the society, which was read in the meeting, shewing them that I did not want an addition, but was willing to give up a quarter part, as I had told the Committee: The event was that the society refused to act upon the warning. The annual meeting soon came; the society dropped these
<PB N="9" REF="016775_0008_0F9E23EA18CB32D0"/>
men, and put in a new Committee; at which they appeared extremely offended both with me and the people: And now they began to fault my preaching, and to form a party in the parish. No stone was left unturned to disaffect all they could influence towards my preaching; and whatever I said in pub∣lic was perverted and condemned as heretical and damnable. One of them left the com∣munion. A few days after, being at my house, I asked him the reason of his conduct in withdrawing from communion? He told me it was owing to his being offended with me and the church: I asked what we had done to offend him? He told me that I preached doctrines he thought were false, and the Church received them. I told him he was wrong in leaving the communion until he had given me and the church notice of his uneasiness and endeavoured to set us right, if wrong; and would never be justified in do∣ing as he had, and read to him some passages in Cambridge Platform, which he professed to like, and which condemned such practice. He then told me he had done nothing with∣out advice from a neighbouring <HI>Clergyman,</HI> who told him he could not be blamed for leaving the communion when he pleased. I discoursed with him two several times, and laboured to convince him of his error; but all was in vain, he supported himself upon
<PB N="10" REF="016775_0009_0F9E23EAD3328530"/>
the advice of this <HI>Clergyman,</HI> but refused to tell me his name, though I have since dis∣covered who the <HI>Clergyman</HI> is; he lives in a neighbouring town, and was a <HI>member of the late Consociation.</HI> This delinquent member, nevertheless, has had the <HI>audacity</HI> to deny that I ever faulted him for withdrawing from communion. In June last the <HI>Association</HI> set at my house, a few days before which <HI>Solomon Bixby</HI> brought a paper to me containing ten <HI>articles</HI> of <HI>charge</HI> against my doctrines, which he said he intended to lay before the <HI>Association,</HI> desiring me to read the same, and say whether I owned them or not; I read them, and observed to him that they were generally false as they lay in the charge, and not one of them expressed as I had express∣ed myself upon those matters: He then de∣sired me to draw a complaint myself, that I would be willing to own, as he depended upon me for proof; I told him, I was will∣ing to do it, but had not time then. The Association met, and he appeared and present∣ed his complaint as he had shown it me be∣fore, without any signers but himself, though in behalf of others: Upon the <HI>Association</HI>'s insisting that the others referred to should subscribe said complaint with him, he pro∣cured three others, viz. <HI>Samuel Fuller, Ze∣phaniah Alden,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin Ellis.</HI> The <HI>Association</HI> asked me whether I owned the
<PB N="11" REF="016775_0010_0F9E23EE16400B80"/>
charge? I told them that in general it was wrong, but that there were some things so near the truth, that I thought it would be dishonourable to deny them. I was then desired to point out what I owned; I did so, which were four of the articles. The <HI>Associa∣tion</HI> then went into the consideration of what should be done; I told them that I suppos∣ed they had no cognizance of the case—one of the members told me I was mistaken, and added, "I had a <HI>hint</HI> of this, and therefore put the Platform in my pocket," and taking it out read a passage about heresy, &amp;c.—I told him I had not the same notions of he∣resy that he had: Another replied, <HI>"why all error is heresy:"</HI> I then concluded to leave them to proceed as they pleased without making any opposition at that time. They soon resolved upon a committee to meet on future time to confer on matters, and pro∣posed the same to me; I told them that as I had been publicly accused, I chose to de∣fend myself in public, should therefore choose that the <HI>Consociation</HI> be convoked if they judged the matter cognizable by them; but that was declined: I then told them that I would not converse with the committee, but if they desired it, would send them, in writ∣ing, a defence of what I owned of said charge. Accordingly the Committee was ap∣pointed to meet at the Rev. Mr. <HI>Perry</HI>'s, Sep∣tember
<PB N="12" REF="016775_0011_0F9E23EF4B07CAA0"/>
1.—I wrote them according to pro∣mise. They advised to calling the <HI>Consocia∣tion,</HI> but referred that matter to the next <HI>As∣sociation,</HI> in October. The <HI>Association</HI> ad∣vising a convocation of the <HI>Consociation,</HI> let∣ters were accordingly issued out for that pur∣pose, and their session appointed to be the first Tuesday in November, at the house of <HI>Ebenezer Gay</HI> at <HI>Stafford.</HI> A few days before the session of said <HI>Consociation,</HI> I re∣ceived an open paper informing me of the <HI>approach</HI> of that <HI>venerable</HI> body to hear and pass judgment on my creed, and <HI>requiring</HI> me to appear before them, signed "<HI>Theodore Hinsdale, Charles Backus,</HI> members of <HI>Con∣sociation.</HI>" On the day appointed about one half the Consociation met at the time and place.</P>

<HEAD><HI>II. PROTESTATION</HI> against the <HI>DESIGN</HI> and <HI>PROCEDURE</HI> of <HI>CONSOCIATION</HI> at <HI>WEST-STAFFORD,</HI> with the <HI>REASONS</HI> of it at large.</HEAD>
<P>AS soon as the Consociation was opened I desired, and with great difficulty at length obtained, leave to read them a paper, in which I denied their jurisdiction and right to judge on articles of faith, or make a creed for me; reminded them that the divine dis∣pleasure had been always testified against
<PB N="13" REF="016775_0012_0F9E23F07AD25598"/>
those who had presumtuously undertaken to frame creeds, judge on articles of faith for others, and impose subscription. I complain∣ed also of injurious and abusive treatment in the paper sent me, notifying me to appear be∣fore Consociation <HI>as judges;</HI> and plainly told that venerable body, that unless they expli∣citly disavowed those words <HI>judge</HI> and <HI>re∣quire,</HI><NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">It is very plain in the original of the notification sent me, that the word <HI>require,</HI> was first written <HI>request:</HI> But it seems this word was too gentle, pa∣cific and humane, to suit with the haughtiness and arrogance of the subscri∣bers, and therefore was changed, on second thought, for the word require.</NOTE> in their notification, I should consider myself in duty bound to publish it as approv∣ed by them, that the United States of America might be sensible what they had yet to expect from the dying struggles of the <HI>man of sin.</HI> I told them I should never meet them again when <HI>required</HI> so to do; but should always be ready and cheerful to wait on them, when desired with decency as a <HI>brother</HI> and <HI>equal.</HI> That I could not submit to them as judges of my faith, without de∣nying the kingly authority of Jesus Christ, until they should produce a commission, with the seal of Heaven affixed to it, constituting them infallible dictators in matters of religi∣on. I desired and even challenged a public disputation with them, on any points of reli∣gion wherein they were pleased to differ from me: And finally put the following questions to them, for a resolution, viz.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="14" REF="016775_0013_0F9E23F0D7BEBC40"/>I. Have you any authority to judge of doc∣trines, respecting their agreement or disa∣greement with the gospel, that we have not?</P>
<P N="2">II. Is your judgment, as such, in any mea∣sure binding on us?</P>
<P N="3">III. What authority have you to require us to appear before you, and answer to a complaint that we teach and hold doctrines contrary to the gospel?</P>
<P N="4">IV. Have we not the same authority, upon report made to us by vile informers, that you teach doctrines contrary to the gospel, to require you to appear before us, and make answer to charges, that you have to require us to appear before you?</P>
<P>I then observed to Consociation, that such lust for power and domination, as but too evidently appeared in them, would illy suit such a free air as we breathed in this country; and that they unhappily came into existence too late for the exercise of spiritual tyranny: And then retired, assuring Consociation of my readiness to wait on them at any time, if treated with civility, as a brother and e∣qual.</P>
<P>Consociation, before their leaving the meeting-house, where they were when this paper was exhibited, voted that it was no bar in the way of their proceedure: And ad∣journed to the house of Mr. <HI>Ebenezer Gay.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="016775_0014_0F9E23F1A0D624A8"/>My paper was exhibited November 2, the first day of the session of Consociation, towards night. The next day, about two o'clock, P. M. I received the following pa∣per from Consociation, signed by <HI>Aaron Church,</HI> Scribe, containing a reply to my questions.</P>
<P>"The Consociation, taking into conside∣ration the matters contained in the Rev. Mr. <HI>Isaac Foster</HI>'s paper, publickly read yesterday, make answer to his questions, as follows,</P>
<P>"Question I. <HI>Have you any authority to judge concerning doctrines, respecting their agreement or disagreement with the gospel, that we have not?</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>Answer.</HI> You as pastor and church, have a sole right to judge for yourselves what doctrines agree with the gospel; be∣fore you consociated with these churches you had a right to judge for yourselves, whe∣ther the doctrines we professed so far agreed with the gospel, that you could consistent therewith have christian and ministerial communion with us. You have now un∣doubtedly a right to judge for yourselves, whether the laws of Christ permit you to continue in fellowship with us. We only claim to ourselves as pastors and churches the same rights with respect to you.</P>
<P>"Question II. <HI>Is your judgment, as such, with regard to doctrines, in any measure bind∣ing on us?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="016775_0015_0F9E23F278D22480"/>"<HI>Answer.</HI> No further than it agrees with the word of God.</P>
<P>"Question III. <HI>What authority have you to require us to appear before you, and answer to a complaint that we teach doctrines contra∣ry to the gospel?</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>Answer.</HI> None at all that implies in us, as Pastors and Churches, any pre-eminence of rank or order above the pastor and church in <HI>West-Stafford.</HI> All the authority we claim is founded, <HI>First,</HI> In that endearing relation between all christian pastors, as fellow ser∣vants of the same Lord, and members of the same body; which necessarily implies a mu∣tual care for, and watchfulness over each o∣ther. <HI>Second,</HI> That christian love which in∣clines us to perform that duty towards you, which is required by the relation aforesaid. <HI>Third,</HI> On the right we claim to judge for ourselves with whom Christ permits us to hold communion, and from whom he charges us to withdraw for the sake of our own pu∣rity and preservation. <HI>Fourth,</HI> The example of the church at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> with regard to unsound doctrine taught in the <HI>Gentile</HI> churches, <HI>Acts</HI> xv. and the exhortation given to <HI>Timothy</HI> to charge some at <HI>Ephesus</HI> that they teach no other doctrine, 1. <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 3. <HI>Fifth,</HI> Your union with us as a church con∣sociated by your particular consent, founded in the foregoing christian principles, and sig∣nified
<PB N="17" REF="016775_0016_0F9E23F32EC4E680"/>
and ratified by your long practice of sitting and judging with us in similar cases: In the forms of which Consociation it is agreed, 'That all cases of scandal that fall out within the circuit of any of the aforesaid Consociations, shall be brought to a council of the Elders, and also the messengers of the churches within the said circuit. That when any case is orderly brought before any coun∣cil of the churches, it shall there be heard and determined; which shall be a final issue, and all parties therein concerned shall sit down and be determined thereby.'</P>
<P>"Question IV. <HI>Have we not the same autho∣rity upon report made to us by vile informers, that you teach doctrines contrary to the gospel, to require you to appear before us and make answer to charges, that you have to require us to appear before you?</HI></P>
<P>"<HI>Answer,</HI> In the answer to the first que∣stion.</P>
<P>"With regard to the exceptions taken against the words require and judge, contain∣ed in the citation sent to Mr. <HI>Foster,</HI> we claim no other respect nor authority than what is founded in the forementioned prin∣ciples of the communion of churches, and expressed in the constitution of consociated churches, which you, as well as we, have adopted. Nor do we mean to impose our judgment, in matters of doctrine, in any sense
<PB N="18" REF="016775_0017_0F9E23F3ED074090"/>
or measure as binding on you, otherwise than as warranted by those principles, and that constitution. The Council do therefore hereby only signify to you, that they desire and expect you to attend and pay that re∣gard, and no other, which is due to brother pastors and sister churches, consociated with you and the church under your pastoral care for the purposes of Christian and ministerial communion."</P>
<P>This is said, "A true copy from the minutes," and is attested by "<HI>Aaron Church,</HI> Scribe."</P>
<P>Here follow the replies to what the Con∣sociation was pleased to call answers to my questions.</P>
<P>[Note. <HI>What is put into notes under this head of replies to the Consociation's answers to my questions, was not exhibited to Consociation, but is now added. Want of time and oppor∣tunity, during the session of Consociation, obliged me to be as concise as possible in my re∣plies to their pretended answers to my que∣stions.]</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. Reply to your first answer.</P>
<P>1st. I do not suppose that any Christian or society of Christians have right, from the New-Testament, to withdraw communion from an individual Christian, whether preach∣<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/> professor, or from a Christian church, except in the two instances of heresy and
<PB N="19" REF="016775_0018_0F9E23F4937425F8"/>
scandalous immorality; nor did I ever imagine that you was warranted by the con∣stitution of Connecticut churches to deny Christian fellowship on any other accounts. Your Platform, if I can understand it, gives you no such right, but forbids any such thing. Confession of faith, chap. xxi. sect. 2. Preface p. 6. This right of private judg∣ment and decision, both you and your Plat∣form acknowledge. Now Christ hath ne∣ver given individuals, nor churches, any right or privilege, the conscientious use of which will unavoidably subject them to the inconveniences and hardships attending a denial of Christian fellowship and commu∣nion: For then it would follow, that a man, by his fidelity to Christ, would, by Christ's rules, be debarred the communion of Christians! Indeed we shall never act right, nor according to the mind of Christ in these matters, until we determine not to withdraw communion from any individual, or Church, except they either believe or act contrary to express scripture, <HI>i. e.</HI> are heretical or im∣moral. If we as individuals, or in council, should have certain doctrines and tenets re∣ferred to us, that were evidently not contrary to express scripture, purely that we might have opportunity to give our opinion con∣cerning their agreement or disagreement with implicit or doubtful scriptures; we
<PB N="20" REF="016775_0019_0F9E23F5639F2BD0"/>
might, warrantably enough give our opini∣on, and tell our sense of the scriptures re∣ferred to in said doctrines and tenets: But when we say, we will not read, pray, preach or commune at Christ's table with those who differ from us in the interpretation of implicit or doubtful scriptures, we go on for∣bidden ground, and treat our fellow men in∣juriously.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">I would observe further upon this answer to my first question, that it is really no answer at all. My question is, 'Have you any authority to judge concerning doctrines, respecting their agreement or disagreement with the gospel, that we have not?' '<HI>Answer.</HI> You, as pastor and church, have a sole right to judge for yourselves what doctrines agree with the gospel?' Is this an answer to the question? It stands thus, 'Have you a right we have not?' <HI>Answer.</HI> 'You have a sole right.' The answer proceeds, 'Before you consociated with these churches you had a right to judge for yourselves, whether the doctrines we professed, so far agreed with the gospel, that you could, consistent therewith, have Christian and ministerial communion with us.' I ask again, is this a reply to m<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> question? 'Have you a right, &amp;c. we have not?' <HI>Answer.</HI> 'You had a right to judge whether you could consistently have Christian and ministerial communion with us.' The an∣swer yet goes <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> You have now undoubtedly a right to judge for your∣selves, whether the laws of Christ permit you to continue in fellowship with us' Again the question is, 'Have you authority or right we have not, to judge of the agreement of doctrines with the gospel?' <HI>Answer.</HI> 'You have a right to judge whether you can consistently continue in fellowship with us.' The last clause of their answer is, 'We only claim, as pastors and churches, the same rights with respect to you.' What do these words 'with respect to you,' refer to? Certainly they refer to the judgment respecting the consisten∣c<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> or inconsistency of comm<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ning, having fellowship, &amp;c. For they cannot refer to the f<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the answer; for it would be nonsense to say, 'You have a sole right, &amp;c. and we claim only the same right with respect to you.' A sole right in one man does not, as I know of, have any respect to a sole right in any other man. But there is nothing about communion of fellowship in the question. These words therefore, 'with respect to you,' refer to judging on something foreign to the question, viz. the consistence or inconsistence of communing. Therefore, neither in the whole, nor in any part of this answer of the Consociation, is there to be found any answer to my question: No<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> should I ever have suspected it was designed a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> an an∣swer, had I not <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> the word, Answer, wrote at the beginning of it. It has been easy for these Gentlemen to have given a direct answer to my question, if it had been consistent with the design of their convention at Stafford.</NOTE></P>
<P>Gentlemen, if I perfectly understood what
<PB N="21" REF="016775_0020_0F9E23F6141F88F8"/>
you intended by withdrawing communi∣on; the utmost you pretend a right to do, it might possibly ease me of many present difficulties.</P>
<P N="2">2dly. I never supposed, neither be∣fore nor since my consociation with you, that you held any doctrines, which for∣bid ministerial or Christian communion with you.</P>
<P N="2">II. Question 2d. <HI>"Is your judgment, as such, with regard to doctrines, in any measure binding on us."</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> "No further than it agrees with the word of God."</P>
<P>Pray, Gentlemen, is the above a reply to the question? The question is this, Is your judgment, in point of doctrine, binding upon us? You say, or seem to say, So far as it agrees with the word of God. But who is to be judge of this agreement or disagree∣ment of your judgment with the word of God? Am I to judge for myself, or are you to judge for me? Again, granting your judg∣ment agreeable to scripture: Am I to re∣ceive and embrace it out of deference to to your judgment, or from a sacred regard to the divine authority? And, if from a sa∣cred regard to the divine authority, should my judgment respecting the interpretation of implicit or doubtful scriptures differ from yours, does this give you a right to do it,
<PB N="22" REF="016775_0021_0F9E23FB14CA6B10"/>
or would it justify you in withdrawing communion from me? <NOTE N="(a)" PLACE="foot">My second question is this, 'Is your judgment, <HI>as such,</HI> with regard to doctrines, in any measure binding on us?' Consociation answer, 'No fur∣ther that it agrees with the word of God.' Here, as in their answer to my first question, they evidently evad<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> giving a direct and pertinent answer. I did not ask them whether their judgment, if it agreed with the word of God, was binding on us; but whether their judgment, <HI>as such,</HI> was binding</NOTE></P>
<P N="3">III. Question 3d. <HI>'What authority have you to require us to appear before you, and answer to a complaint that we teach doctrines contrary to the gospel?'</HI></P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> 'None at all that implies in us, as pastors and churches, any pre-eminence of rank or order above the pastor and church of <HI>West-Stafford.</HI>' If you, as pastors and churches, have no authority that implies any pre-eminence of rank or order above the pastor and church in <HI>West-Stafford;</HI> you certainly have none at all. Yet you seem to think you have some, or you would not have undertaken to give the grounds of it.</P>
<P N="1">1st. For your first ground of authority. Does this 'endearing relation you speak of; or this care and watchfulness implied in it,' give one pastor a right to decide for another in matters of faith, or not? That it does, is neither self-evident, nor allowed by all men. Here you will allow me to wait for proof. If it does not give any right to decide in mat∣ters of faith, then I cannot see the pertinen∣cy of its being mentioned in this manner. The grand question is yet undecided.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="23" REF="016775_0022_0F9E23FC79A57A10"/>2dly. Is the 'duty required,' an exercise of a right in one pastor to decide in articles of faith for another? The grand thing in question is yet undecided.</P>
<P N="3">3dly. The things which are essential to Christian communion and fellowship are ei∣ther left to be decided by man's judgment, or they are decided by Christ, either expres∣ly or by indubitable consequences of what is expressed. If these essentials of Christian communion be left to be decided by human judgment, then one man hath as good a right to judge what and how many they are, as any other man. And if every man hath an equal right, &amp;c. then no man hath any right to impose his judgment concerning these essentials, &amp;c. on any other man: Be∣cause the right any one man hath to impose his judgment on another, supposes this other to have no right to judge for himself. Then also no public body of men have a right to impose their judgment, concerning the essen∣tials of Christian communion on any other public body, or on any individual: Because the imposition destroys the idea of a right in the public body, or the individual imposed upon, to judge in this case, contrary to the supposition. The right any public body has to impose their judgment, is certainly made up of the <HI>sum total</HI> of their individual rights. If no individual therefore has any right to im∣pose
<PB N="24" REF="016775_0023_0F9E23FD8AE43928"/>
his judgment on any man, then no public body hath: For ever so many cyphers will not amount to a <HI>sum.</HI> By this it is unde∣niably evident that the essentials of church-communion are not left to be decided by men. If these essentials, &amp;c. are decided and determined by Christ, whether it be expressly or by the indubitable consequences of what is expressed; the matter is plain, and mankind are not subjected to any of those great inconveniences attending the various and differing decisions of fallible men.</P>
<P N="4">4thly. To this reply several things.</P>
<P><HI>First.</HI> The doctrines taught by those who went from <HI>Judea</HI> to <HI>Antioch</HI> did not concern the essentials of Christian communion, at that time, nor of salvation, <HI>Acts,</HI> xv. 11, 21. <HI>Burkitt</HI> and <HI>Henry</HI> on the 21st verse.</P>
<P><HI>Second.</HI> No withdrawing of communion was so much as dreamed of by either side in this dispute.</P>
<P><HI>Third.</HI> If the doctrines taught by those men had regarded the essentials of religion, the council at <HI>Jerusalem</HI> had sufficient authority to decide upon them; verse 28. Their de∣crees were of divine authority, dictated and directed by the Holy Ghost. When the Consociation, now convened in this place will be pleased to show their authority to preface their result with these words, "It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us," I shall
<PB N="25" REF="016775_0024_0F9E23FD938D7670"/>
readily acknowledge the pertinency of men∣tioning the council at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> as a prece∣dent for their convention and procedure; until then I must view it altogether imperti∣nent: And do really judge the Consociation would view it so too, had they scriptures to mention that were pertinent to their pur∣pose. <NOTE N="(b)" PLACE="foot">Mr. <HI>Hart,</HI> in his remarks on a late Pamplet wrote by M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>Hobart,</HI>&amp;c. says, p. 4. "And he," <HI>i. e.</HI> Mr. <HI>Hobart,</HI> <Q>introduces Dr. <HI>Increase Mather,</HI> as answering such as enquire▪ <HI>Where have we an institution for synods?</HI> That, <HI>we have scripture example for a synod,</HI> referring to the case of the disputants at <HI>Antioch,</HI> agreeing that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas</HI> should go up to <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> to the Apostles and elders about that question which so much perplexed them. But with submission, this referrence of this case was not to a <HI>synod,</HI> or council of churches, but to the Apostles and Elders at <HI>Jerusalem.</HI> And if I knew where to find a church, in which there were any of the holy Apostles yet living, I should be for an immediate referrence of all questions and controversies about doctrines to them, as invested by <HI>Christ himself,</HI> with a decisive authority. The most that can be made of this ex∣ample is, that it carries in it an intimation to particular ministers and churches, not to be willful in their controversies among themselves; but when they find their debates cannot bring them to a mutual agreement, in any cases of difficulty, that it is expedient for them to seek light and counsel from other ministers, or churches, or other wise Christians.</Q></NOTE></P>
<P>To the quotation 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> i. 3. Gentlemen, is it an article in the charge exhibited to you, that the pastor of the church in <HI>West-Staf∣ford,</HI> entertains his people with "fables and endless genealogies," &amp;c. I am perfectly ashamed to see scriptures thus quoted! and I beg, Gentlemen, you would never let it be known, out of your own body, that these texts were used under these circumstances.</P>
<P N="5">5thly. "Answer."—I am utterly igno∣rant of any union I ever formed with you, which was signified and ratified by my long
<PB N="26" REF="016775_0025_0F9E23FE55749590"/>
practice of sitting and judging with you in similar cases, since I have no remembrance that a <HI>similar case</HI> ever came under the con∣sideration of the Consociation since I com∣menced a member: For other matters, be∣sides religious opinions and articles of faith, have ever been under consideration when∣ever I have attended Consociation, so far as I am able to recollect.</P>
<P>As to the article in the administration of church discipline you refer to, if the article has respect to cases of <HI>heresy</HI> and <HI>scandal,</HI> we object not: But would observe that it is no∣thing to the purpose for which it is cited. If it has regard to religious sentiments and arti∣cles of faith, we utterly disclaim it. <HI>First,</HI> Because it at once annihilates the right of private judgment; erects an infallible tribu∣nal on earth; and gives men liberty to usurp Christ's throne. <HI>Second.</HI> It would in∣volve the compilers of the Platform in a gross contradiction; see Confession of Faith, chap. 21. Sect. 2d. As to the third article to which you refer, respecting cases of scan∣dal, &amp;c. I would ask, How is this to your purpose? Do you suppose it is a scandal, a shame and disgrace, for a man to believe for himself? <HI>i. e.</HI> a censurable evil? Is one man's differing from another in his creed, a scandalous thing, and does it render him un∣fit for Christian communion? This cannot
<PB N="27" REF="016775_0026_0F9E23FF1801BC98"/>
be: For then we should all, in this respect, be scandalous creatures; since, perhaps, it would be impossible to find two men who believed just alike in religious matters. Yet, if we grant that two men might thus agree, they might nevertheless differ from a third man, which would be a shame to them. Further, the worthy compilers of the Con∣fession of Faith did not look upon it scanda∣lous for a man to be allowed liberty of con∣science and right of private judgment; see Confession of Faith, Chap. xxi. Sect. 2d. Hence you see the Platform is not a volun∣teer in your service, but draughted. By this the Gentlemen of the Consociation may be sensible how they have misinterpreted our venerable ancestors, the compilers of the Platform.</P>
<P>You are so far from taking up the words <HI>require</HI> and <HI>judge,</HI> that what you observe is rather an avowal of your right and authority to use and apply them in the form you have done. But be intreated, Gentlemen, to give yourselves time for reflection. The term <HI>require</HI> imports authority the requirer has over the required. Now I ask, Who gave you this pre-eminence in point of authority? From what source did it derive? Is it 'from Heaven, or of men?' If from Heaven, it is in the Bible; and if in the Bible, pray point me to the grant and form of investiture. If
<PB N="28" REF="016775_0027_0F9E23FFF22FE298"/>
of men, Have not the popish and episcopal churches the same authority, and derived from the same source?</P>
<P>I include both terms, as the authority in exercise both in requiring and judging must be the same.</P>
<P>These replies were sent to, and received by, Consociation while sitting in <HI>West-Stafford;</HI> but never answered.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From the above answers and reply, every reader of discernment will see, <HI>First.</HI> That the pretended answers of Consociation to my questions, are in reallity no answers but evasions; and evasions greatly studied and laboured. <HI>Second.</HI> That plain, pertinent, express answers to said questions, such as an honest, upright man would have given to them, would at once have divested Consociation of all that authority they saw fit to assume; left them without any pretence whatever, to vindicate the high popish claim, on which they grounded their proceedings, and obliged them to evacuate their quarters, and retreat without planting their standard.</NOTE></P>
<P>A public disputation, oral or by writing, upon any points of doctrine, in which I dif∣fered from Consociation, was often request∣ed by me and a committee of the church in <HI>West-Stafford,</HI> and as often refused by Con∣sociation.</P>
<P>WHEN Consociation were together in the meeting-house, the first day of their sessions, Nov. 2d, 1779, and had heard the paper read by the Rev. <HI>Isaac Foster,</HI> containing his denial of their jurisdiction, &amp;c. the Rev. <HI>Dan Foster,</HI> a member of Consociation, entered his protestation against the design and pro∣cedure of Consociation, and desired liberty to offer his reasons for said protestation <HI>pub∣licly,</HI>
<PB N="29" REF="016775_0028_0F9E2402C57CC518"/>
and at that time; but was prevented offering them then, by reason of objections made to it by several members of Consocia∣tion. In the evening following, however, li∣berty was obtained to read the paper, contain∣ing the reasons of the protestation, to Conso∣ciation, though in a much more private way than that in which it was desired to be read, and in which the protestation had been made. For this reason, among others, the paper is now made public. What is in the text only was read to Consociation; the notes and quotations in them have been added since, as a confirmation of the sentiment; or at least to shew that, if the author errs in sentiment, he does not err <HI>alone,</HI> but in com∣pany, and in very respectable company too.</P>
<P>Gentlemen of this venerable Consociation,</P>
<P>I had, the other day, the disagreeable opportunity to read a citation sent to the Rev. <HI>Isaac Foster,</HI> Pastor of the second church in <HI>Stafford;</HI> which is as follows,</P>
<LETTER>

</LETTER>
<P>That one ambassador of Jesus Christ should be <HI>required</HI> by another, to appear be∣fore an earthly tribunal, to <HI>answer to charges</HI> respecting <HI>doctrines and articles of religious faith,</HI> certainly savours strongly of spiritual tyranny and despotism. Have these Gen∣tlemen really espoused that <HI>old, trite, unrea∣sonable, anti-scriptural, bloody, persecuting, popish maxim,</HI> "That the church," or any body of men on earth, "has a right to de∣cree articles of faith!" No. And is it ima∣gined, that the decrees of an ecclesiastick coun∣cil concerning doctrines and articles of faith
<PB N="31" REF="016775_0030_0F9E240727377D60"/>
imposed upon an <HI>American,</HI> will be readily received and acquiesced in?</P>
<P>Will <HI>Americans,</HI> true and genuine sons of the fair Goddess Liberty; who have been for several years, and still are, struggling with all the horrors of war, facing the blazing cannon, encountering nameless perils, diffi∣culties, dangers and deaths, to establish her on the throne of these United States, and confirm her salutiferous, balmy regency in this land: Will these, I ask, subscribe creeds, articles of faith, and confessionals, drawn up and imposed on them by the clergy and ec∣clesiastick councils and synods! Will they, who neither fled nor submitted at the roar of cannon, and the sound of martial arms in the day of battle, be terrified and awed into submission by the baneless and innoxious thunder of the vatican! Gentlemen, I cer∣tainly do not mean to speak diminutively of the clergy, or of ecclesiastical conventions: But I affim, that no clergyman, or number of clergymen, or ecclesiastick council, of whatever denomination, have right to make religious creeds, canons, or articles of faith, and impose them on any man, or church, on earth, requiring subscription to them.</P>
<P>As an evidence, yea, a demonstration of the negative of this question, let it be observ∣ed, that the business of creed-making never did any good in the church, never promot∣ed
<PB N="32" REF="016775_0031_0F9E240753E4D1B8"/>
the truth, or suppressed <HI>heresy;</HI> but al∣ways, without exception, had the contrary effect.</P>
<P>Some of the peculiar tenets of <HI>Arius</HI> were esteemed by the Emperor <HI>Constantine the Great,</HI> and some part of the Christian church, perhaps, heretical and dangerous. Upon this <HI>letters missive</HI> were issued out by the <HI>mode∣rator</HI> of the first general ecclesiastick council, <HI>Constantine,</HI> to the bishops of the several provinces of the empire, to meet at <HI>Nice</HI> in <HI>Bythinia,</HI> A. D. 325. Accordingly great numbers of the bishops convened together at time and place, with great <HI>punctuality, gravi∣ty</HI> and <HI>solemnity!</HI> The fulsom encomiums given this august and venerable assembly of bishops, presbyters, deacons, &amp;c. by some partial historians of the court-party of that day, I shall never undertake to repeat: But only to enquire what good this convention did, and whether they suppressed the <HI>Arian heresy,</HI> and prevented the rising of others, or not? And I know not that I can do this better than by reciting the words of President <HI>Dickison</HI> concerning this council, as I find him quoted. "The synod of <HI>Nice</HI> did in∣deed impose subscriptions; but what was the consequence, but horrible schisms, convulsi∣ons and confusions, until the church was crumbled into parts and parties, each uncha∣ritably anathematizing one another? Never
<PB N="33" REF="016775_0032_0F9E240815E81010"/>
was the church infested with such a swarm of <HI>hereticks</HI> and <HI>heresies,</HI> as sprang from that corrupt fountain of imposition and subscripti∣on. The <HI>Arians</HI> were not only strengthened in their <HI>heresy,</HI> and increased in their num∣bers by their persecution; but there was quickly added to them the black catalogue of <HI>Eustathians, Macedonians, Anomoioi, Euno∣mians, Photinians, Luciferians, Anthropomor∣phites, Apollonirians, Dimeritae, Massiliani, Antidicomorianitae, Collyridiani, Me<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>angis∣monitae, Psathirians, Eutychians, Seleuciani, Patriciani,</HI> with a long and almost endless <HI>et caetera.</HI> All which <HI>heresies</HI> rose out of the bottomless pit, in about seventy years space, in the same church. Whence one council was convened after another, to draw up new creeds, and impose new subscriptions, until almost every article of Christianity was both condemned and established. This was the mark set by providence upon the first sub∣scription of this kind, that was ever imposed in the world; and this the defence and pro∣pagation that followed from it. The churches of <HI>New-England</HI> have all continued from their first foundation non-subscribers; and yet retain their first faith and love. From all this I think, it naturally follows, that sub∣scription is not necessary for the being, or well-being of the church; unless hatred, variance, emulation, wrath, strife, seditions and here∣sies
<PB N="34" REF="016775_0033_0F9E24096BA6BE60"/>
are necessary to that end." Thus far the judicious and learned President concerning the consequences of creed-making and sub∣scription practised by this venerable council. And whoever will be at the pains of search∣ing ecclesiastick history for the consequences of the other six general synods, will certain∣ly find, that <HI>heresies</HI> innumerable, strifes, di∣visions and sub-divisions, with an endless train of evils, followed them all.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The consequences of creed-making and subscription practised in the church of Christ, presented to the reader in the following faithful abstract of ecclesiastick history for the space of four hundred years.</P>
<P>The council of <HI>Nice,</HI> the first oecumenical or general council, condemned the religious tenets and sentiments of <HI>Arius,</HI> A. D. 325. Prodigious trou∣bles immediately arose. Some held with the council, others with <HI>Arius.</HI> A. D. 330, <HI>Arius</HI> was recalled from banishment by <HI>Constantine the Great;</HI> and the severe laws against him were repealed. <HI>Athanasius,</HI> one of the most violent against <HI>Arius,</HI> in the <HI>Nicene</HI> council, was, in his turn, banish∣ed into <HI>Gaul,</HI> A. D. 335, by the council of <HI>Tyre.</HI> Then the Arian party flourished again. The people of Alexandria refused to admit Arius to communion. Constantine commands Alexander the bishop of <HI>Constantino∣ple</HI> to admit him to the communion. After the death of Constantine the Great, Constantius held with the Arians: Constantine and Constans Em∣perors of the West, with the council of <HI>Nice.</HI> Hence arose endless animo∣sities and seditions, treacherous plots, and open acts of injustice and violence between the two contending parties, the Arians and Nicenians. Council was assembled after council, council against council, and their jarring and contradictory decrees spread perplexity and confusion throughout the whole Christian world. Constans was assassinated, A. D. 350. A great part of the western empire, particularly <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> fell soon into the hands of his brother Constantius. This change was extremely unfavourable to the ad∣herents to the decrees of the council of <HI>Nice.</HI> This Emperor's attachment to the Arians induced him to involve their adversaries in countless troubles and miseries. He compelled great numbers to embrace Arianism; among others <HI>Liberius</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Pontiff, A. D. 357. The <HI>Nicene</HI> party meditat∣ed reprisals, and waited only a fit opportunity, &amp;c. to avenge themselves. In∣deed the history of the church, during the reign of Constantius, presents the reader with a perpetual scene of tumult and violence, and the deplorable spec∣tacle of a war carried on between brothers, without religion, justice or hu∣manity, on account of their differing sentiments in religion! The death of Constantius, A. D. 362, changed cons<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>derably the face of religious affairs, and diminished greatly the strength and influence of the Arian party. <HI>Julian</HI> bestowed his favours and protection on neither side.—<HI>Jovian,</HI> his successor, favoured the <HI>Nicene</HI> doctrine—and immediately the whole west, with a considerable part of the eastern empire, changed sides, conformed to the de∣crees of the council of <HI>Nice,</HI> and abjured the Arian system. A good evi∣dence that this religious controversy was espoused and carried on from views of religion and conscience!</P>
<P>The scene however soon changed again, when <HI>Valentinian</HI> and his brother <HI>Valens</HI> were raised to the empire, A. D. 364. <HI>Valentinian</HI> adhered to the decrees of the <HI>Nicene</HI> council; and hence the whole Arian sect, a few churches only excepted, were destroyed and extirpated in the west. <HI>Valens,</HI> on the other hand, favoured the Arians; and his zeal for their cause exposed their adversaries the <HI>Nicenians,</HI> in the eastern provinces, to many severe trials and sufferings. These troubles however ended with the death of this Em∣peror, who fell in a battle against the <HI>Goths,</HI> A. D. 378. He was succeed∣ed by <HI>Gratian,</HI> a friend to the <HI>Nicenians,</HI> and a restorer of their tranquility. <HI>Theodosius the Great,</HI> however, who succeeded him, raised his terrible vio∣lence against the Arians; and rendered the decrees of the council of <HI>Nice</HI> triumphant over all opposition; so that the barbarous nations, the <HI>Burgun∣dians, Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals</HI> were the only professors of Arianism in public, be∣cause not conquered. In this long and shocking contest between the <HI>Niceni∣ans</HI> and Arians, it will be difficult to determine which party most exceeded the bounds of probity, charity and moderation. The members of the Arian sect were wretchedly torn into factions, which regarded each other with the bitterest aversion. The ancient writers make mention of these under the names of Semi-Arians, Eusebians, Aetians, Eunomians, Acacians, Psathyrians and others.—The Arian controversy produced new sects, occasi∣oned by the indiscreet lengths to which the contending parties pushed their respective opinions. Many who opposed Arianism ran headlong into system<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> of doctrine as bad or worse. Others who defended them went further than their chief, and thus fell into errors much more extravagant than those he embraced. Hence arose the Apollinarians, Marcellians, the Photinians, whose leader, Photinus of <HI>Sirmicum,</HI> was chastised not only by the Niceni∣ans, in the councils of Antioch <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Dr. Lardner says this council at</HI> Antioch <HI>was held by the</HI> Eusebians, <HI>or</HI> Arians, <HI>not by the</HI> Orthodox, <HI>or</HI> Nicenians, <HI>as Dr. M<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sheim affirms.</HI> Cre∣dibility, &amp;c. vol. ix. p. 13.</NOTE> and Milar, in the years 345 and 347, and that at Sirmicum, without date; but by the Arians also, in an assembly of theirs at Sirmicum, 351. Then Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople, arose, who was sent into exile by the influence of the Eunomians, by the council of Constantinople, A. D. 381, which is commonly called the second general or oecumenical council. A great number of other sects arose in about 70 or 80 years after the first Nicene council, though of less note than those mentioned above; all owing their rise to the corrupt and abominable prac∣tice of subscription, set on foot by that council.</P>
<P>Early in the 5th cent. A. D. 404, the council, overcome by the in por∣tunity of St. Augustin, bishop of Hipps, were prevailed with to send a depu∣tation of their body from Carthage to the Emperor Honorius, requesting that the laws might be put in force against the Donatists, a sect still very numerous. The Emperor was not so forward for persecuting men on ac∣count of their religious tenets as these <HI>holy fathers;</HI> and therefore only or∣dered a fire to be imposed on those of that sect, that would not return in∣to the bosom of the church. But it seems his humanity and lenient temper were put to too severe a test by a second deputation sent from those <HI>follow∣ers and imitators of the mesk and lowly Jesus,</HI> assembled at Carthage, A. D. 407, importuning him, that the laws made in 405, entitled <HI>acts of unifor∣mity</HI> might be put in force and more strictly executed against the Donatists. Though this faction of the Donatists was much broken by these reiterated shocks; yet it mightily revived again, after the death of Stiticho, who was put to death by the order of Honorius. The gentleness and humanity of Honorius got the better of his prejudices again, and in 409, he published a law in favour of <HI>liberty</HI> of <HI>conscience,</HI> and prohibited all compulsion in mat∣ters of religion. But this law was not of long continuance. What could be the reason of its discontinuance? It was certainly founded upon the sound∣est principles of reason, policy and religion, and calculated to promote the universal good both of church and state. The answer is obvious, and the reason of its abolition most apparent. It suited not the haughty, assuming, arrogant spirits of the <HI>clergy</HI> of that day, those ghostly fathers of the church, who, failing in point of argument, <HI>wanted the civil sword to refute their adversaries with!</HI> The earnest and repeated solicitations of near three hun∣dred bishops, met together at Carthage, in 410, prevailed with Honorius the Emperor to repeal and abrogate that good and salutary law! The Tri∣bune Marcellin<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>s was sent by Honorius into Africa, to put an end to this controversy: And here he met 286 Catholic bishops, and 279 of the Dona∣tists in council; and held a conference with them of three days, and finally gave sentence in favour of the Catholics. The Donatists appealed to the Emperor, but to no purpose. This shock almost ruined the sect for a time. The Donatists however recovered their former liberty and tranquility, by means of men of more refined sentiments of honour, generosity, humani∣ty and religion than the catholic bishops of that day; viz, the Vandals, a barbarous and savage nation of the north, who, under Genseric invaded and took the province of Africa from the Romans. But so soon as the Arians had found a secure retreat among the barbarous Goths, Suevi, Heruli, Van∣dals and Burgundians, and had obtained a little power, they persecuted the Nicenians to as great a decree of severity and inhumanity, as they had been persecuted by them. Genseric, and Hunerie his son, the kings of those bar∣barous nations, pulled down the churches of those who held the divinity of Christ, sent their bishops into exile, maimed and tortured multitudes that were firm in adherence to their creed. And justified their proceedings by the ex∣amples which were set them by the Christian emperors and bishops!—Pre∣sently after this arose the sect of the Nestorians, formed by Nestorius, a Sy∣rian, bishop of Constantinople, and a disciple of the celebrated Theodore of Mopsuestia. The council of Nice had not decreed any thing concerning the manner or effect of the union of two natures in the saviour. Hence the bishops and doctors had, for about 100 years, expressed themselves as they pleased, concerning these things. In 428, Anastasius declaimed vehement∣ly against giving <HI>Mary</HI> the title, <HI>mother of God,</HI> and said she ought to be called <HI>mother of Christ.</HI> Nestorius warmly espoused the sentiment, and hence the sect—Cyril, of the see of Alexandria, took fire, consulted with Celestine bishop of Rome, assembled a council at Alexandria, A. D. 430, and hurled no less than 12 anethemas at the head of Nestorius. <HI>Here is a controversy now between two bishops, of the first dignity, about a matter too, not of greater importance than the</HI> tithing of mint, anise and cumin; <HI>yet it was carried on without reason, moderation, justice, religion, or even the least shadow of humanity; because they would not tolerate each other in different sentiments!</HI> After Cyril and Nestorius had reciprocally excommunicated each other, and exasperated each other's spirits to the utmost, a council was call∣ed by Theodosius the younger, A. D. 431, to be held at Ephesus, <HI>which was the third oecumenical council.</HI> In this council Cyril presided, though a party concerned, and an avowed enemy of Nestorius!! Nestorius objected against the proceedings of the council, as irregular and unjust; but, his remonstrances being without effect, he refused to comply with the summons that called him before the council. Cyril, the moderator, pushed on matters with a lawless violence, and Nestorius was judged without being heard; and, in the absence of a great number of bishops who belonged to the council, he was compared to the traitor Judas, charged with blasphemy against the divine Majesty, de∣prived of his episcopal dignity, and sent into exile, where he finished his days. The transactions of this council, says the historian, will appear to the candid and equitable reader in the most unfavourable light, as full of low ar∣tifice, contrary to all the rules of justice, and even destitute of the least air of common decency. <HI>May God grant that none of our posterity may ever have occasion to read the similar transactions of an ecclesiastick council in America▪</HI> This Ephesian council, as might be well expected, instead of healing divi∣sions, did but inflame them more and more, and almost destroyed all hope of restoring concord and tranquillity in the church. John of Antioch, and the other eastern bishops, for whose arrival Cyril had refused to wait, met at Ephesus, and pronounced against him and Memnon the bishop of that ci∣ty, who was his creature, as severe a sentence at they had thundered against Nestorius. Hence arose a new and obstinate dissention between Cyril and the Orientals, with John the bishop of Antioch at their head. Notwith∣standing all that was done against them, the Nestorians, aided mightily by Barsumas, created bishop of Nisibi<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, A. D. 435, spread their tenets, in this and the following century, through Egypt, Syria, Arabia, India, Tartary and China. A violent aversion to the Nestorian tenets led many into the op∣posite extreme. This was the case with the famous Eutychus, the foun∣der of the Eutychians. Who about A. D. 448, was ordered to renounce his error, by the council assembled by Flavianus at Constantinople. He obsti∣nately refused to comply with the decrees of the council, and appealed to a general council. In consequence of which, the Emperor Theodosius as∣sembled an <HI>oecumenical council</HI> at Ephesus, A. D. 449, at the head of which he placed Dioscorus bishop of Alexandria, successor to Cyril, and a very faithful imitator of his pride, arrogance and fury, and a declared enemy to the bishop of Constantinople. Accordingly matters were conducted in this, as they had been in the former Ephesian council, when Cyril presided. The Greeks called this council a band, or assembly of <HI>robbers, sun<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>don leestrikeen,</HI> to signify that every thing was carried on by fraud or violence.—The face of affairs soon changed, and assumed an aspect utterly unfavourable to the party whom the Ephesian council had rendered triumphant. For upon the death of Theodesius, Marcian his successor complied with the demand of a general council, made by <HI>Leo the Great</HI> bishop of Rome. The council was assembled at Chalcedon, A. D. 451. The fourth oecumenical council. Dio∣scorus was condemned, deposed, and banished into Paphlagoni<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, the acts of the council of Ephesus were annulled, the epistle of Leo, received as a rule of faith; Eutychus, who had been already sent into banishment and deprived of his sacerdotal dignity by the emperor, was now condemned, though ab∣sent! The remedies however applied by this council, to heal the wounds of a torn and divided church, proved really worse than the disease. Troubles infinite immediately arose. To put an end to them, the Emperor Z<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>no, by the advice of Acacius, bishop of Constantinople, published, A. D. 482, the famous Henotican, or decree of union, designed to reconcile the contending parties. This decree repeated and confirmed all that had been enacted in the councils of Nice, Constantinople, Ephesus, and Chalcedon, against the Arians, Nestorians, and Eutychians. There were bitter complaints against the Henoticon, as injurious to the honour and authority of the most holy council of Chalcedon. Hence arose new contests and new divisions, not less deplorable than those which the decree of the union was designed to sup∣press. It produced new and endless contests both among the Eutychians and the partisans of the council of Chalcedon. The doctrines of Pelagius were condemned in a council at Carthage, A. D. 412. This controversy was refered by Coelestius and Pelagius to the decision of Zosimus the Roman Pontiff, who was raised to that see, A. D. 417. He decided in favour of the monks, and declared them sound in the saith. The African bishops, with Augustin at their head, persisted in their sentence. Zosimus yielded to the perseverance of the Africans, changed his mind, and condemned, with the utmost severity, Pelagius and Coelestius, whom he had honoured with his approbation, and covered with his protection! The unhappy disputes about the opinions of Pelagius, occasioned, as usually happens, other controversies equally prejudicial to the peace of the church and the interests of true Christianity.—The sects of the Manichean<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, Semi Pelagians, Donatiste, Arians, Nestorians, Eutychians, Mono<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>hysites, and these principal sects crumbled into various factions and divisions, remained in the 6th century.</P>
<P>A fifth oecumenical council was convoked at Constantinople, by the Em∣peror Justinian, A. D. 553. In this council the emperor gained his point, and had both the doctrines of Origen and the three chapters condemned. This council, instead of healing matters by their decrees, made them much worse, and gave rise to such divisions in the church, as could only be healed by length of time. Many separated themselves from the communion of the Pope, on this occasion, and carried their dissentions to a tedious and de∣structive length.</P>
<P>The ancient sects remained and were still in the church in the seventh century, and instead of being suppressed by the great number of councils of the three proceeding centuries, they were really increased and prodigiously multiplied thereby.</P>
<P>Though the Greek church was already torn asunder by the most lamen∣table divisions, yet its calamities were far from being at an end. A new sect arose, 630, under the reign of Heraclius, which shortly excited such violent commotions, as engaged the eastern and western churches to unite their forces in order to its extinction. Heraclius having conversed with one Paul, a man of great credit and influence among the Armenian Monophysites, and with Athanasius the bishop of that sect; issued an edict, A. D. 630, in fa∣vour of the doctrine of <HI>one will,</HI> and <HI>one operation</HI> in Christ. Cyrus, who had been promoted by the emperor to the see of Alexandria, assembled a council, and got the doctrines of Monothelitism, introduced by the em∣peror's edict, confirmed. This new modification of the doctrine of the coun∣cil of Chalcedon, had the desired effect upon the Monothelites, and induced great numbers of them to return into the bosom of the church. Notwith∣standing this promising appearance, there presently succeeded the most dread∣ful tumults. Sophronius a monk of Palestine, who was present at the council at Alexandria assembled by Cyrus, in 633, had violently opposed the decree of that council confirming the doctrine <HI>of one will.</HI> His opposition, though treated by the council with contempt, became formidable the follow∣ing year. When raised to the patriarchal see of Jerusalem, he summoned a council in which the Monothelites were condemned as <HI>hereticks,</HI> who <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>∣vived the Eutychian errors. Sergius the patriarch of Constantinople inform∣ed Honorius, and determined that Pontiff in favour of Monothelitism. Hence arose those obstinate contests which rent the church into two sects, and the state into two factions. To put an end to these factions and com∣motions, Heraclius issued out, in 639, the famous edict composed by Sergius, called the <HI>ecthesis,</HI> or exposition of the faith; in which all controversies upon the question, <HI>whether there was one or two operations in Christ,</HI> were strict∣ly prohibited. A number of the eastern bishops assented to this edict. In the west the case was quite different. John, the 4th Roman Pontiff of that name, assembled a council at Rome in 639, in which the <HI>ecthesis</HI> was rejected, and the Monothelites condemned. Nor was this all; for in the progress of this contest, a new edict named <HI>the type,</HI> or <HI>formulary,</HI> was pub∣lished in the year 648, by the emperor Constans, by the advice of Paul of Constantinople; by which the <HI>ecthesis</HI> was suppressed. But this did not give content. Martin, bishop of Rome, in a council assembled at Rome, A. D. 649, consisting of 105 bishops, condemned both the <HI>ecthesis</HI> and the <HI>type;</HI> and thundered out the most dreadful anathemas <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>gainst the Monothe∣lites and their patrons, who were solemnly consigned to the devil and his angels! The emperor Constans highly incensed at these haughty proceedings of Martin, who treated the imperial laws with such contempt, ordered him to be seized and carried into the island of Naxo<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>, where he was kept prisoner a whole year. And, for several years, this unhappy controversy seemes to be extinguished; but it was a lurking flame, which spread secretly, and gave the more considerate reason to dread new combustions, both in church and state. To prevent these Constantine Pogonatus, the son of Constans, pur∣suant to the advice of Agatho the Roman Pontiff, summoned the 6th ge∣neral or oecumenical council, A. D. 680, in which be permitted the Mono∣thelites and pope Honorius himself to be solemnly condemned in the pre∣sence of the Roman legates, who represented Agatho in that assembly, and confirmed the sentence pronounced by the council by the sanction of penal laws, enacted against such as pretended to oppose it. The Monothelites however continued in the church down to the 12th century. As the two last councils had decreed nothing concerning ecclesiastick discipline, nor religious ceremonies; to supply this defect, a new assembly of bishops was held pur∣sue it to the order of J<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>stinian II, in a spacious hall of the imperial palace, called <HI>Trullus,</HI> i. e. <HI>cupula,</HI> from the form of the building. This council met, A. D. 692, and was called <HI>Quinisextum,</HI> being considered by the Greeks as a supplement to the 5th and 6th general or oecumenical councils.</P>
<P>Thus we have looked through the history of the 4th, 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries, and the seven oecumenical councils; all of which, except the last, were convened to <HI>judge</HI> of articles of faith, make creeds, form confessionals, determine the sense of scripture, require subscriptions, and terminate religious controversies. The consequences of all these <HI>general councils,</HI> and of every other council which met for the same purposes, for 400 years, were con∣stantly and invariably the same, viz the multiplication of errors, the intro∣duction of tumults, strifes, divisions, wrath, emulations, schisms, convulsions, factions, and a long and nameless train of the most destructive evils and ca∣lamities to the Christian church. Not a single heretick was ever reclaimed, not an error suppressed, nor one good consequence ever produced, by any one, or by all these ecclesiastick councils during 400 years. And if we should trace down the history of the church to the present century, we shall find the same consequences always and invariably following all ecclesiastick councils, which have ever been holden, to <HI>judge</HI> of articles of faith, make creeds, or com∣pare religious tenets with creeds already made, impose subscriptions, condemn errors, excommunicate or reclaim hereticks, &amp;c. And, as human nature is the same in all ages, we have the greatest reason to expect the same con∣sequences will follow all councils that shall ever, through divine sufference, be convened for these purposes, so long as time shall endure. For it is con∣trary to reason, to the will of Heaven, to all the principles of human liberty and that right which the Deity himself hath granted to all mankind, to search, examine and judge for themselves in all matters of religion, that an ecclesiastick council should ever meet for such purposes as above. Indeed it is surprising and greatly astonishing, that any ecclesiastick council should be guilty of such bold and daring presumption as to meet for the purposes of judging upon articles of faith, making creeds, imposing subscriptions, con∣demning whom they shall be pleased to call erroneous, <HI>withdrawing com∣munion,</HI> &amp;c. after more than 1400 years sad and awful experience of the odi∣ous, abominable, destructive and God-provoking consequences of such prac∣tices! It is impossible God should ever manifest his displeasure against any thing, if he hath not constantly done it against such conduct.</P>
<P>Though I am perfectly satisfied of the truth and justness of these observa∣tions, both as concerning the rights of ecclesiastick councils in matters of faith, and the consequences of their presuming to judge in these matters, yet I am willing it should be known that I am not alone in my judgment of these things. The sentiments of an ancient father Greg. Nazian. as I find him quoted by the Dissenting Gentleman, p. 141, 142, are, <HI>Sic sentio, si verum scribendum est,</HI> &amp;c. My opinion it this, if I may be allowed to speak the truth; that all <HI>conventions</HI> of bishops are to be avoided: For I never saw any good come of any <HI>synod;</HI> nor that it did not much more mischief, than it hindered. For truth, in such assemblies, is generally borne down by a spirit of strife and vain glory. The Dissenting Gentlemen himself ob∣servee, p. 258, 259. "Ecclesiastical <HI>synods,</HI> from the famous <HI>council</HI> of <HI>Nice,</HI> down to the non-famous <HI>convocation</HI> of L—n, anno 1717, sad experience hath shewn to have been little else than the pests and troublers of mankind; mints where pernicious errors have received the stamp of authori∣ty, and been sent out to corrupt the church, and to set the world in flames; and that, for the most part, they have been conventions of interested, ambitious, factious and angry men, who under a fair pretence of <HI>zeal for the Lord of bosts,</HI> have been driving furiously and foully on in pursuit of worldly views; and with an affectation of being thought <HI>contending earnestly for the faith,</HI> have been only contending, like the disciples, who should be <HI>greatest among themselves.</HI>" And, not to swell this note to too great a length, whoever will be at the pains of reading the following authors, will certainly find them speak∣ing the same sentiments, viz.

<P>For a reply to these questions, I will,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> Enquire what <HI>heresy</HI> is?</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> What is the duty of Christians concerning it?</P>
<P>One man is not to be called an <HI>heretick,</HI> purely because he differs from another, as to the articles of his faith. For then, either we
<PB N="41" REF="016775_0040_0F9E24141432F5A0"/>
should all be <HI>hereticks,</HI> or there could be no <HI>heresy</HI> among us. If my neighbour is to be denominated an <HI>heretick,</HI> purely because he differs from me in his opinions about religi∣ous matters; then am I also to be denomi∣nated an <HI>heretick,</HI> because I differ from him in my opinions about religious matters: For certainly I differ from my neighbour in my religious tenets, as much as my neighbour differs from me in his.</P>
<P><PB N="42" REF="016775_0041_0F9E2414D40B9398"/>Again, Men of different religions cannot be <HI>hereticks</HI> to one another.

The <HI>al∣coran,</HI> the law of <HI>Moses</HI> with various traditi∣ons, the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, and numberless almost traditions of the Old and New Testament, only are the

<P>These things being premised, <HI>heresy,</HI> among those <HI>Christians</HI> who acknowledge the word of God to be their <HI>only</HI> rule of faith, is, a se∣paration made in a church on account of things not <HI>expressly</HI> contained in the word of God.

<P><PB N="45" REF="016775_0044_0F9E241B0E758DA8"/>St. <HI>Paul</HI> says of the <HI>heretick, "he is sub∣verted, and sinneth, being condemned of him∣self."</HI> And what he here says of him is perfectly consistent with what hath been said above concerning an <HI>heretick.</HI> The Bible is the only rule of faith a Christian church hath adopted; an individual in that church, whether preacher or hearer, it matters not, hath formed certain opinions, not <HI>expressly</HI> contained in the Bible, and insists upon it thas his brethren shall subscribe them.

<P>The learned and judicious critick, Mr. Poole, gives the same meaning to the words <HI>heresy</HI> and <HI>heretick,</HI> as is above given. Says he, <HI>"Est ergo hic hereticus, is qui per opini∣onem,

<P N="2">II. Let us enquire what is the duty of Christians concerning an heretick?

<P>And this treatment of the <HI>heretick</HI> is agre∣able to the sentiment of the learned critick before quoted.

endeavour to exterminate heresy? Reject, re∣fuse it? 2. Can we with a good conscience permit men to profess or preach heresy? In a church that adopts the Bible as her <HI>only</HI> rule of faith, if a man either profess or preach that she ought to adopt something else; for instance, several notions and tenets he has formed, in addition to the Bible, as her rule of faith; the church must admonish him a first and second time; if he still persist in professing or preaching his heresy, the church must refuse, reject and avoid him. 3. How shall we prevent the growth and prevalence of <HI>heresy,</HI> any otherwise than by bringing o∣pinions, termed <HI>heretical,</HI> to some test or standard of orthodoxy? St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells us, an <HI>heretick</HI> is <HI>"condemned of himself:"</HI> If so, cer∣tainly there can be no necessity for bringing his opinions to any test or standard of ortho∣doxy.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Heresy does not consist in opinion or sentiment; it is not an error of <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ead</HI> but of the <HI>will. Bu<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> kitt</HI> on <HI>Tit.</HI> iii, 10, says, "Learn hence, <HI>First,</HI> Who is an <HI>heretick</HI> in the Apostle's sense, even he who is perverted from the true faith, and holds opinions which subvert the foundation of it; and one who is condemned in his own conscience, and sins against his own <HI>convicti∣ons?</HI> For the Apostle here bids <HI>Titus,</HI> not to inform him of his <HI>errors,</HI> but admonish him of his <HI>fault,</HI> which shews, that the <HI>crime lay not in his head, in his understanding,</HI> but in his <HI>will and affections:</HI> For <HI>no man who acts according to his judgment and conscience, how erroneous soever, it self-condemned</HI> in that action." <HI>Henry</HI> on the place says, "<HI>Knowing that he that is such is subverted, i. e.</HI> turned off from the foundation, and sinneth grievously being self-condemned. Those that will not be reclaimed by admo∣nitions, but are obstinate in their sins and errors, are <HI>subverted</HI> and <HI>self-con∣demned;</HI> they inflict that punishment upon themselves, that the governors of the church should inflict upon them; they throw themselves out of the church, and throw off in communion, and so are self-condemned."</P>
<P>It is surprising any man should imagine <HI>heresy</HI> to be an error of judgment, when St. <HI>Paul</HI> says "he is self-condemned;" which could not possibly be the case on this supposition. Hence let a man's sentiments be what they may, if he believes them to be true, he is not an <HI>heretick,</HI> because not self-condemned.</P></NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="016775_0047_0F9E241D183FD320"/>In a christian church which subscribes the Bible as her <HI>only</HI> rule of faith, no man can possibly be an <HI>heretick</HI> while he insists upon nothing else as the rule of faith, or necessary to church-communion, or essential to salvati∣on: But whenever any man, in such a church, does insist upon subscription to any thing else but the Bible, as the rule of faith, or neces∣sary to church-communion, or essential to salvation, he is an <HI>heretick,</HI> and must be treat∣ed as such.</P>
<P>But some <HI>sincere conscientious people</HI> may still ask, Is there not such a thing as false doctrine, short of <HI>heresy,</HI> which is not to be endured in our churches? I am sensible a reply to this question will bring the <HI>great and important business of ecclesiastick councils, conventions,</HI> and <HI>synods,</HI> under consideration: But I am the rather willing to attempt a re∣ply on that account.</P>
<P>And in order to a reply, let several things be premised.</P>
<P N="1">1. A preacher of religion is the sole judge, for himself, with regard to the truth or fals∣hood of the doctrines he delivers. If it were otherwise, and a man were obliged to preach what other men judged to be truth, he must then be obliged to do the very thing for which our Saviour condemned the <HI>Scribes

and Pharisees,</HI> i. e. to teach for doctrines the commandments of men. Nor could he possi∣bly comply with St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s direction to the Christian preacher, <HI>"Take heed unto thy doc∣trine."</HI> Unless it be said, that the Christian preacher is to take heed that his doctrine a∣gree with human creeds and articles of faith!</P>
<P N="2">2. The Bible contains <HI>expressly</HI> every thing necessary to Christian communion in this world, and eternal felicity and happiness in the world to come, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 16, 17. All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for cor∣rection, for instruction in righteousness: That the man of God may be throughly furnished unto all good works.</P>
<P N="3">3. Each brother in the church, and every hearer of a preached gospel, are sole judges for themselves, with regard to the truth or falshood of what they hear; its agreement or disagreement with the unerring standard the word of God. <HI>"To the law and to the testimony: If they speak not according to this word, it is because there is no light in them." Isa.</HI> viii. 20, was the direction given to the <HI>Jewish church</HI> with regard to what they heard. <HI>"Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: Because many false prophets are gone out into the world,"</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 1, is the directio<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

given to the <HI>Christian church</HI> with regard to what they hear.</P>
<P N="4">4. No man, or body of men, no ecclesiastick council, convention, or synod, of whatever name, have any right to judge for any Christian on earth, but themselves, whether preacher or hearer, what he shall preach or what he shall hear; whether what he preaches, or hears, be true or false, agreeable or repugnant to the Bible.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>The author of the history of religion, introduces Dr. <HI>Foster,</HI> saying, "Religion therefore is only so far praise-worthy as it is the matter of our choice; and since religion is the means of procuring us acceptance with God, it necessarily follows, that every man has an undoubted right to judge for himself."</P>
<P>The author himself says, p. 96, "Every man must have a right to judge of the true meaning, and the obligation of those laws that come under his notice; and where the laws of an inferiour clash with those of a superiour, reason and consciousness will point out the proper deference to the laws of a superiour. This alone justifies the separation from any establishment, and destroys the principle of force."</P>
<P>This author also cites bishop Hoadley, p. 96, 97. "Religious truths, says bishop Hoadley, is what concerns every one. Religion there can be done without enquiry; for what is contrary to the first notions of God, established upon the evidences of reason, cannot be admitted by any one who believes a God upon this evidence, because it destroys all those principles of reason itself. What is contrary to the plain design or declaration of the gos∣pel, cannot be received by any one who believes the gospel, because it de∣stroys the authority of the gospel in which he believes. And what is con∣trary to the fundamental principles of the reformation, without which it could never have been at first, and now cannot consistently be defended, will <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ot, cannot be received by any true protestant, because it destroys his vary may<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to that name, and is the very thing which, as a protestant, he receives."</P></NOTE></P>
<P>In proof of which I have already observ∣ed, that no ecclesiastick council of any deno∣mination, that hath ever been in the Christian church, hath ever done any good, hath ever promoted truth, or suppressed error; but al∣ways the contrary; when ever they have un∣dertaken to judge of doctrines for others, or
<PB N="51" REF="016775_0050_0F9E241F53222D98"/>
to make creeds and formulas for the churches.</P>
<P>The truth of this proposition is also a na∣tural and necessary inference from the three propositions just premised.</P>
<P>The New Testament every where sup∣poses all men, both preachers and hearers, <HI>sole</HI> judges, for themselves, with regard to the truth and falshood of doctrines of religi∣on, and their agreement and repugnancy to the unerring standard.</P>
<P>Now, to answer the question put, Whe∣ther there is not such a thing as falshood, or false doctrine, short of <HI>heresy,</HI> which is not to be endured in our churches?</P>
<P>I doubt not the possibility of a man's preaching false doctrines; doctrines not con∣tained either explicitly or implicitly in the Bible; yea, it may be granted possible, per∣haps, that a man may preach things contrary to what is thus contained in the Bible: Not contrary to what is <HI>expressly</HI> contained in the the Bible, but contrary to what may be there∣in implied. Now, if a man preach nothing contrary to any <HI>express</HI> proposition of the Bible, though he may often deliver things repugnant to what is implied therein; yet, so long as his church, the people of his charge, are easy under his ministry, and do not discern the repugnancy of his doctrines to the Bible; no man, or body of men, no ecclesiastick council, of whatever name, have
<PB N="52" REF="016775_0051_0F9E2423DB8C5670"/>
any divine right to disturb this worshipping assembly of Christians, by any of their no∣tions, opinions or decrees whatsoever; for the reasons above given, viz. that the preach∣er hath a <HI>sole</HI> right of judging, for himself, with regard to the truth or falshood of his doctrines, and their agreement or disagree∣ment with the unerring standard: And that his hearers have also a <HI>sole</HI> right of judging, for themselves, with regard to the truth or falshood of the doctrines they hear, and their agreement or disagreement with the unerring standard.</P>
<P>I have put the case now as favourably as possible on the side of those who hold the <HI>popish tenet</HI> above with reference to the au∣thority of ecclesiastick councils. For it hath been generally the case, that a man charged with preaching false doctrine, and things disagreeing with the implications of the Bi∣ble; hath been <HI>guilty</HI> of delivering some things contrary to <HI>long prescription,</HI> and <HI>hoa∣ry creeds and confessionals,</HI> made by men, and unjustly and injuriously imposed on man∣kind! And I greatly fear, yea, I know, if au∣thentick history does not lie, that both preach∣ers and professors of religion have oftner been persecuted, proscribed, imprisoned, deprived and slain, for preaching and professing doctrines and opinions contrary to <HI>sacred creeds</HI> and <HI>confessions of faith,</HI> and the <HI>established religi∣on,</HI> than for contradicting any thing implied
<PB N="53" REF="016775_0052_0F9E242543455760"/>
in the Bible! Witness the cruelties and hor∣rid sufferings of that part of Christ's church which fled into the wilderness, and endea∣voured to shelter themselves in the low countries and vales of <HI>Piedmont</HI>—of the <HI>Wickliffites</HI> in <HI>England</HI>—the <HI>Protestants</HI> in <HI>Germany</HI>—the <HI>Non-conformists</HI> and <HI>Puritans,</HI> our pious and illustrious ancestors, in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> and numberless others, in all parts of <HI>Europe.</HI> Were these worthies always persecuted and tormented to death, because they departed from the <HI>Bible-creed</HI> in their preaching and professions! Pride, ambition, lust of power, instigating men to practise upon that <HI>exploded popish maxim,</HI> were the formal cause of the sufferings and deaths of these faithful witnesses of <HI>Jesus;</HI> who, long since, wear bright, glorious and unfading crowns, in the kingdom of <HI>his</HI> father and <HI>their</HI> father.</P>
<P>When the case is really such in any church or worshipping assembly of Christians, that they universally, or very generally, disapprove of, and are disgusted with, the doctrines and tenets of their preacher, as judging them in∣consistent with reason, and repugnant to the word of God; I know not of any power on earth that has a right to oblige that church, or worshipping assembly (after they have taken all reasonable pains rightly to inform their own judgments, like the noble <HI>Bereans</HI> of old, by searching the scriptures) still to live

under his administrations. But yet no ec∣clesiastick council hath any business here; so far at least as the matter relates to opini∣ons and doctrines preached and heard in this church. If an ecclesiastick council be called in by the church and people in this situation, <HI>purely</HI> to advise as to the expediency or in∣expediency of dismissing the pastor; I have not so much to object against it: Though I confess I know not that even this measure is warrantable, from any thing that is either expressed or implied in the New Testament.</P>
<P>Put the case, that a very few individuals in a church, or worshipping assembly of Christi∣ans, are dissatisfied with some particular te∣nets and doctrines of the preacher; whilst however the pastor and nine tenths of the church and people are agreed and satisfied as to these tenets and doctrines. Neither the pas∣tor, nor majority of the people, pretend to impose subscription to these obnoxious tenets, as they are called, on the minority, or any individual. Neither of these tenets is con∣trary to <HI>express</HI> scripture, nor <HI>expressed</HI> in the scripture, and therefore not essential to church-communion and salvation; nor necessary to be believed by any Christian, nor denied. For every thing essential to church-commu∣nion and salvation is <HI>expressed</HI> in the Bible; and every thing necessary to be denied and rejected by a Christian man is contrary to <HI>ex∣press</HI>
<PB N="55" REF="016775_0054_0F9E242618C199C8"/>
scripture. This is evident upon the least reflection, for certainly a good and gra∣cious God designs the present peace and fu∣ture happiness of mankind: He would not therefore leave things so in his word, the on∣ly rule of the Christian's faith, as to endan∣ger the present peace, much less the future happiness of mankind: But if every thing ne∣cessary to be received or rejected by the Christian man, were not <HI>expressed</HI> in the Bi∣ble, or plainly and indubitably contrary to <HI>ex∣press</HI> scripture; both the present peace and future happiness of men would be endanger∣ed; for scarce two men can be found who agree in their interpretations of implicit or doubtful scriptures, or in any articles or points of doctrine neither expressed in the Bible, nor indubitably contrary to what is there ex∣pressed: Therefore we may depend upon it, that the spirit of God hath <HI>expressed,</HI> and ex∣plained <HI>expressly,</HI> every necessary article of the Christian creed. Therefore the tenets and doctrines complained of, are not of the es∣sentials of religion. However, representati∣on is made to the Association of these obnoxi∣ous tenets; the Association take pains to in∣form themselves in the matter, and advise to the convention of the Consociation to <HI>hear</HI> and <HI>judge</HI> on the premises. The preacher is desired and even <HI>required</HI> to appear before this venerable body of <HI>clergymen</HI> and <HI>laies,</HI> to
<PB N="56" REF="016775_0055_0F9E2426D53CC480"/>
<HI>answer to charges</HI> exhibited against him, for <HI>preaching</HI> and <HI>holding</HI> such dangerous doc∣trines!</P>
<P>Now, Is not all this mighty stir perfectly right? What will the poor criminal preach∣er do? And what will this august assembly of divines and philosophers do?</P>
<P N="1">1. To the question, Is not all this stir per∣fectly right? I reply, This convention of Consociation is, in my humble opinion, wrong, mistaken, unadvised, anti-scriptural, and oppressive.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This convention is to hear and <HI>judge</HI> upon articles of faith, and they have, according to the supposition above, <HI>required</HI> the accused to appear be∣fore them, to <HI>answer to articles of charge,</HI> concerning <HI>doctrines</HI> and <HI>religious opinions.</HI> Hence it is apparent this venerable body imagine they have some authority in these matters. And in truth they really have some authority, or they have abused two plain English words, <HI>judge</HI> and <HI>require;</HI> both which words immediately convey to the minds of all, who hear or see them, whether they be simple or learned, the idea of authority. But if this body claim authority, they must necessarily claim <HI>infallibility;</HI> because, if they are not endued with infallibility, they will lead those into error, most likely, on whom they impose their <HI>authoritative judgment.</HI> "This claim of au∣thority," says the Dissenting Gentleman, "is an invasion of the divine pre∣rogative, and in the language of the Holy Ghost, a sitting in the temple of God, shewing itself that it is God. It is a claim of <HI>honour</HI> as due to a com∣pany of poor, <HI>frail</HI> and <HI>fallible</HI> men, which belongs only to the omniscient and infallible God, and to Christ the sole lawgiver and king in the church. It is the very root of Antichristianism; the prop upon which the whole system of popery rests; it came from the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and thither it directly leads." p. 232.</P>
<P>The celebrated Mr. <HI>Prior</HI> says of such boasted authority, "Oh! the <HI>tragedies</HI> this usurped <HI>authority</HI> has acted in the world! It was <HI>authority</HI> that put the Lord of life to death, and opposed the propagation of his gospel. It was <HI>authority</HI> that brought in <HI>purgatory</HI> and <HI>transubstantiation,</HI> with all the other absurdities of the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and made them sacred from ridicule. It was <HI>authority</HI> that hid the purity of the gospel so long from our eyes, and delayed the reformation for ages before it happened. <HI>Authority</HI> has often <HI>consecrated</HI> error; <HI>nursed</HI> ignorance, and <HI>suppressed</HI> truth. <HI>Authority</HI> has made knaves: <HI>Authority</HI> has made fools: But <HI>mere authority</HI> has seldom propogated virtue, or true religion. The <HI>very claim</HI> of this <HI>authority</HI> is a reproach to <HI>Christianity;</HI> and an insult upon common sense."—"The author and finisher of our faith has given his ministers a commission to de∣clare his will; to administer his ordnances; to receive those to communion, whom the scripture-canon receives; to exclude those, whom that excludes; to reprove them that act amise; to exhort to repentance, and to enforce their exhortations with the highest authority of Almighty God, the awful powers of another world, and all the engagements of <HI>redeeming</HI> love. Fur∣ther degrees of church power I know not." <HI>Charge,</HI> p. 45, 46. Indeed the members <HI>themselves</HI> that compose our <HI>modern</HI> conventions ecclesiastick, afford an unanswerable argument, that such conventions have no authority to <HI>judge</HI> on <HI>articles</HI> of <HI>faith,</HI> to <HI>censure</HI> others, <HI>condemn</HI> and <HI>excommunicate,</HI> as they take upon them to do. For who can imagine, or dare affirm, that the <HI>Lord Jesus Christ</HI> has given commission to <HI>mere novitiates</HI> in antiquity or divinity, to <HI>mecanicks</HI> and <HI>husbandmen,</HI> to <HI>judge</HI> on <HI>articles</HI> of <HI>faith, censure</HI> and <HI>condemn!</HI> &amp;c. Dr. <HI>H<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>r<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></HI> observes with regard to this matter, "If indeed no one would <HI>judge</HI> in a cause he did not understand; if no one were allow∣ed to understand a cause of <HI>heresy,</HI> but who was a good judge of the <HI>sense of scripture</HI> and of <HI>primitive antiquity;</HI> if no one were esteemed to know <HI>scrip∣ture</HI> and <HI>antiquity,</HI> but those who had <HI>studied them well,</HI> who had read them carefully with <HI>their own eyes,</HI> and did not take the <HI>sense of them upon trust</HI> from modern writers▪ If the arguments for his opinion were to be examin∣ed, before his opinion were condemned; if a man, before he gave his vote, were to lay his hand upon his heart, and declare himself thus qualified to <HI>judge;</HI> that he had considered the matter, and would speak nothing but what he thought: On these suppositions, I am apt to think, a number of judges would not very easily be found; and when they were, it may reason∣ably be presumed, that they would not be very apt to condemn. They would be sensible there was room for honest minde to be misled, from what they had read and observed themselves; they would know that there is more to be said on the other side, than the generality at all dream of; they would be careful how they discouraged learning, by discouraging the enquiries of learned men. They would be very unwilling a man should suffer by their sentence, whose life they are sure is innocent and virtuous, but whose opini∣ons they cannot be so sure are false and dangerous. They know discou∣ragement in learning and virtue to be of such ill consequences, that a man's opinions must be very had indeed, to make it necessary to come to such ex∣tremities. But give me leave to say, you have no reason to expect such judges, or such backwardness to judge. It is always <HI>supposed,</HI> that the doctrine of the church you are of, is right; that it is the doctrine of scripture and an∣tiquity. And this, every body thinks, he understands. So that little learning or reading is necessary, to make any clergyman a judge over the learnedest man alive." Dr <HI>Hare</HI>'s letter to a young clergyman, p. 30, 31. Is it to be presumed that our modern Consociations are always composed of men <HI>thus qualified to judge!</HI> By the <HI>ecclesiastick constitution</HI> of Connecticut, not only laymen, but any men, whom the churches shall choose, may attend their pastors, and sit in judgment on matters of the greatest consequence; which require the greatest abilities, both natural and acquired; the soundest judg∣ment; the greatest candor and moderation, together with the warmest at∣tachment to religion and the real interests of manknd! Is it a breach of charity to suppose, that if Dr. <HI>Hare</HI>'s qualifications were to be required in each member of our Consociations, before they should be admitted to judge, that five tenths of their number would be generally excluded? I presume that if these qualifications were to be read at the opening of the sessions, and those only were to stay behind as judges, who were thus qualified, the number of judges would be extremely small. Yet, according to present mea∣sures, all who come are admitted to judge, without exception! Must we be borne in hand that this is a divine constitution! did it descend from Heaven, and proceed from a God of infinite wisdom and unbounded goodness! has it met with the approbation of that immortal lover of man, <HI>Jesus</HI> our dear and blessed <HI>Redeemer,</HI> who, to plant religion in our dark benighted world, clothed himself in humanity, lived, preached, suffered, bled and died amongst men! I cannot, I may not, believe it! It is blasphemy to say it! It is cer∣tainly evil-speaking both of the wisdom and goodness of the <HI>king</HI> and <HI>head</HI> of the church! If I must submit to <HI>ecclesiastick authority,</HI> and my <HI>religious creed</HI> must be <HI>dictated</HI> by men, I will certainly, following the example of the renowned <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> go to <HI>Rome,</HI> where dwell those who have a much fairer claim <HI>to infallibility,</HI> than any in our church. My reason and conscience, and the duty, and allegiance I owe to the God of nature and grace, my heavenly patron and my <HI>judge,</HI> will never permit me to stand at an human tribunal, and submit the articles of my faith to poor, weak, frail, fallible men! Nor can I whilst I retain my reason, and those ideas of the di∣vine Majestly I now have, be induced to believe, that He ever hath required me so to do, or that He would not be greatly displeased with me, if I should do it.</P></NOTE></P>

<P>We need look no further back into eccle∣siastick history than the reign of <HI>Queen Mary</HI> of <HI>England,</HI> of <HI>glorious memory!</HI> to find great numbers of <HI>citations</HI> which run in the same language, sent to the laborious and painful servants of <HI>Jesus Christ,</HI> to call them into the <HI>high-commission court,</HI> to answer to <HI>charges</HI> of <HI>heresy. "Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad,"</HI> says <HI>Solomon.</HI></P>
<P>I plainly discern <HI>charges of heresy, citations, trials, censures, imprisonments,</HI> if the civil go∣vernment would permit, <HI>deprivations,</HI> ga∣thering thick around such <HI>courteous papers</HI> as that under consideration. I mean that the spirit of the paper, not the Gentlemen who composed it, gives me these ideas. O! this odious business of creed-making and sub∣scription! it hath shed more human blood than all the civil wars since Christ!</P>
<P>Be pleased to look yonder, and behold your neighbours, your dearest friends, your sons and brothers, braving every danger,

struggling with countless hardships, difficul∣ties and deaths, in order to ease off from <HI>you</HI> and <HI>their dear country,</HI> the intolerable weight of oppression and civil tyranny! whilst you at home, in <HI>your easy chairs,</HI> are, in my humble opinion, fast riveting the more gall∣ing and intolerable chains of <HI>ecclesiastick ty∣ranny,</HI> on their necks, and the necks of their children and their children's children!</P>
<P>As to the second name to this paper, <HI>Charles Backus,</HI> his youth, inexperience<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This was the first Consociation Mr. <HI>Backus</HI> ever was a member of; and yet must <HI>require</HI> a Father in the ministry, of upwards of 50 years, to appear before <HI>him,</HI> to <HI>answer</HI> to <HI>charges,</HI> &amp;c. Is this a constitution of <HI>Heaven</HI> that admits of such absurdities! I will as soon believe all the <HI>reveries</HI> of the <HI>Romish church</HI> to be divine!</NOTE> and want of sufficient reading and discernment, might possibly plead a little in his favour, and mitigate somewhat the severity of cen∣sure. But my tongue cannot express the amazement of my mind, upon sight of the name, <HI>Theodore Hinsdale,</HI> set to such an un∣christian paper! A man of upwards of 40 years, of maturity of judgment, reading and discernment! What will not <HI>hoary prescripti∣on</HI> do, when men do not sufficiently exam∣ine for themselves!</P>
<P>These, Gentlemen, are the reasons of my protestation against the present procedure of Consociation in the second society in <HI>Staf∣ford,</HI> Nov. 2, 1779.</P>

<HEAD><HI>III. STRICTURES</HI> on the <HI>REPORT</HI> of a cer∣tain anonymous <HI>COMMITTEE.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ALTHOUGH I repeatedly requested a copy of the result of Consociation at <HI>West-Stafford,</HI> before they left the ground, and was as often promised one as soon as it could be prepared; yet after waiting about a month, and when I had almost concluded the Gentlemen had forgot their promise, or made it with some mental reservation, I received, very much worn and defaced, a <HI>Manuscript,</HI> indorsed on the back in the following words, "<HI>A copy of the Re∣sult of</HI> Consociation <HI>at</HI> West-Stafford, <HI>Nov.</HI> 2, 1779." I unfolded it, and found it attest∣ed by <HI>Theodore Hinsdale,</HI> and <HI>Aaron Church,</HI> Scribes; Scribes of what I could no deter∣mine, unless of the <HI>Committee.</HI> I then look∣ed for the beginning, and found none, or rather that it began in the middle.—I then looked for its regular form and found it had none; I then began in the middle and read it through, and void and darkness was on the face of it throughout, like the original chaos represented <HI>Gen.</HI> i. I then looked to see who were of the <HI>Consociation,</HI> at what <HI>time,</HI> and in what <HI>place</HI> they held their session, and found no place, time nor person; I then looked to see who was the <HI>Complainant,</HI> what the <HI>complaint,</HI> who the Defendant and

where residing, in fine who the <HI>parties</HI> were that appeared to implead each other, and found no <HI>body</HI> and <HI>nothing.</HI> I am obliged therefore to call it the copy of a Result or Report of a certain <HI>anonymous Committee,</HI> at∣tested, as such by the two men before named, and must still wait that their promise of a copy be accomplished, while I repeat my re∣quest of a true, full, and properly attested copy, not of the Report of a nameless <HI>Com∣mittee,</HI> but of <HI>Consociation,</HI> that identical <HI>Con∣sociation</HI> that set in judgment upon my creed last fall, at <HI>West-Stafford.</HI></P>
<P>The following is the Report of this anony∣mous Committee.</P>

<DIV1 TYPE="report">
<P>"<HI>Thursday,</HI> 8 o'clock, Met according to adjournment. The Committee last chosen made their report, which was accepted, and is as follows,</P>
<P>"ART. I. That Children are not born with sinful and vicious natures, and that <HI>A∣dam</HI>'s sin and guilt is not imputed or convey∣ed to his posterity, but Children are born in the image of God, objects of his favour and without desert of punishment. This article owned and defended by Mr. <HI>Foster. Voted</HI> dangerous and contrary to gospel, according to charge. The <HI>Consociation</HI> disapprove of it for the following reason. The word of God is full and express in asserting that men are born into the world with corrupt and de∣praved
<PB N="65" REF="016775_0064_0F9E2432DB30E830"/>
natures, <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 5, speaking of the wickedness of man, it is said, <HI>the imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil con∣tinually. "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one," Job</HI> xiv. 4, and <HI>John</HI> iii. 6. <HI>"That which is born of the Flesh is Flesh," Eph.</HI> ii. 3. <HI>"and were by na∣ture children of wrath, even as others."</HI> And that man derives a corrupt nature from <HI>A∣dam</HI> is abundantly plain from <HI>Gen.</HI> v. 3. And <HI>Adam</HI> begat a son in his own likeness after his image, not after the image of God, in which we read man was first made, <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 27, <HI>"God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him;"</HI> but in his own fallen likeness. <HI>Psalm</HI> li. 5, <HI>"Behold I was shapen in iniquity, and in sin did my mo∣ther conceive me." Rom.</HI> v. 12, and on, <HI>"there∣fore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned."</HI> And 18, <HI>"therefore as by the offence of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation."</HI> And 19. <HI>"by one man's dis∣obedience many were made sinners."</HI> If children are not polluted, why then are they baptized? Why necessary to be regenerated for the enjoyment of God? Thus evident it is to every candid and impartial mind that man is born into the world with a sinful nature, not in the moral image of God, consequent∣ly not free from guilt or desert of punishment.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="016775_0065_0F9E2434E9B4D588"/>ART. II. That perfect obedience is not required of us, but the law that required it of us is entirely abolished. Not proved.</P>
<P>ART. III. That obedience is the only condition in the covenant of grace. Owned and defended by Mr. <HI>Foster,</HI> and as explained in his defence and printed works, was by the council voted dangerous. <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 5, 6. <HI>"But to him that worketh not, but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness"—"Even as David describeth the blessedness of the man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works."</HI> In these words the blessings of the covenant of grace are expressly suspended on faith, but they could not be if obedience in distinction from faith were the only condition. It is certain without holiness no man shall see the Lord, and the gospel contains the most weighty arguments to universal obedience: But this obedience is the fruit of an union with Christ, and it can no more exist without this union than a branch severed from the vine can bear fruit. <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 5. and xi. 6.</P>
<P>ART. IV. That we have a natural and mo∣ral power to do all that the gospel requireth of us. Owned and defended. Voted un∣scriptural and dangerous according to charge. Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> wholly explodes the distinction between natural and moral power as foolish and ridiculous, and in his defence asserts that
<PB N="67" REF="016775_0066_0F9E24360A84BFC0"/>
we have all power necessary to do what the gospel requires of us in order to inherit its blessings. That God doth not require na∣tural impossibilities of men we are as full in asserting as he can be, but at the same time, must believe that man's inability to holiness is such as fully to justify those words of our saviour, <HI>John,</HI> vi. 44. <HI>"No man can come unto me except the father which hath sent me draw him."</HI> And of the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 7. <HI>"The carnal mind is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."</HI>—Should we ad∣mit that man hath full power to do all the Gospel requires of him, in every sense in which he may be said to possess it, we con∣ceive we must then admit a principle of holi∣ness in him naturally, in his fallen state, con∣trary to the word of God, or else utterly de∣ny the force of moral obligation—For to a∣dopt the rule of duty to the blass of the de∣praved heart, is to make it what we please, and it is entirely repugnant to all our notions of the perfections of the deity, that he should give his rational creatures such mutable va∣riable laws, for his laws are all like himself holy, just, and good immutably.</P>
<P>ART. V. That our good works are the matter of our justification at the Redeemer's bar. Owned and defended. Voted unscrip∣tural and dangerous. This article, Mr. <HI>Fos∣ter</HI> professes openly to defend, but to us it
<PB N="68" REF="016775_0067_0F9E243693CBCF60"/>
appears directly opposite to, and subversive of the gospel method of salvation. No doctrine is more plainly and frequently taught, as a foundation principle in the holy scripture, than that the believer's justification before God, is wholly on account of Christ's righte∣ousness. <HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 28. A man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law,—and 20 <HI>"By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight." Titus</HI> iii. 7. <HI>"That being justified by his grace we should be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life." Rom.</HI> v. 19. <HI>"So by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous."</HI> Can any thing be more evident from these and similar texts than that the matter of our justification before God, is not our own personal defective obedi∣ence, but the all-perfect righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and received by faith alone. This righteousness of Christ is the sole and exclusive ground of our pardon and accep∣tance with God, and justification at the Re∣deemer's bar, <HI>Rom.</HI> x. 4. <HI>"For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth."</HI>—Saints in glory are described as having their robes made white in the blood of the lamb. <HI>Rev.</HI> vii. 14. "These <HI>are they which came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb.</HI> If our works are the matter of our justification at the re∣deemer's
<PB N="69" REF="016775_0068_0F9E243768D2CE40"/>
bar, it is difficult to say for what purpose Christ died, or how be is mediator between God and man.</P>
<P>ART. VI. That Christ's righteousness is not sufficient for our acceptance with God, that being a legal righteousness, but we must have a gospel righteousness for which we shall be accepted. Voted, proved according to charge. For the reasons we refer to the texts cited under the preceeding article.</P>
<P>ART. VII. That the doctrine of particu∣lar and personal election is not known in the word of God. Proved according to charge. It is proved in the opinion of the Consociation that Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> explodes the idea of personal election, particularly in a sermon delivered at the ordination of his son <HI>Daniel,</HI> pages p. 50 and 51. This doctrine is plainly and fully taught in divine Revelation. <HI>Eph.</HI> i. 11. <HI>"In whom also we have obtain∣ed an inheritance being predestinated accord∣ing to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will."</HI> And 4, 5. <HI>According as he hath chosen us in him before the foundation of the world; having predestinated us unto the adoption of chil∣dren by Jesus Christ. Rom.</HI> viii. 29. <HI>Whom he did predestinate—moreover, whom he did predestinate, &amp;c. &amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>ART. VIII. That Christ died for the whole world in this sense, that one as much
<PB N="70" REF="016775_0069_0F9E243828CC03F8"/>
as another is alike given to Christ. This Article is proved according to charge in the judgment of this Council, in the sermon Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> preached at Mr. <HI>Joel Foster</HI>'s or∣dination.—This Consociation doubt not of the sufficiency of the merits of the saviour for the whole world: But it will not hence follow that Christ died for all intentionally alike, or that one as much as another is given to Christ. <HI>John</HI> xvii. 9. <HI>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for they are thine</HI>— and 20, <HI>Neither pray I for these alone but for them also who shall believe on me, through their word. John</HI> vi. 37. <HI>All that the father giveth me shall come to me, and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out.</HI> If Christ died for all, as much for one as another, then if all do not actually participate of the benefits of his death, and at last arrive to Heaven, his pur∣pose and intention must be frustrated.</P>
<P>ART. IX. That the righteous man who is pardoned and justified and has the promise of life, may fall from his righteousness and finally perish. Not sufficiently proved.</P>
<P>ART. X. That the Bible is badly translat∣ed, much of it, and in one place an error in the original.</P>
<P>As to this article, the Consociation are of opinion that Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> only meant that there were errors in some Hebrew copies.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="016775_0070_0F9E2438F06BBC98"/>Therefore we think ourselves holden in faithfulness on this occasion, to bear our open testimony against the abovementioned doc∣trines held and taught by Mr. <HI>Foster,</HI> as be∣ing not only contrary to the gospel, and of dangerous tendency, but some of them, at least, even subversive of the Christian insti∣tution, and to say that we cannot but look upon these errors persisted in, as utterly dis∣qualifing for the gospel ministry, and there∣fore that we cannot in conscience hold com∣munion with the pastor who persisteth in them.</P>

<P>As the reader has the report before him, I think it needless to repeat the articles in the following strictures.</P>
<P>ART. I. &amp;c.—Voted dangerous and con∣trary to gospel, according to charge, and dis∣approved for the following reason: 'The word of God, say they, is full and express in asserting that men are born into the world with corrupt and depraved natures.'—Very confidently said, but where are these <HI>full</HI> and <HI>express</HI> scriptures to be found in the word of God? Why, <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 5, is one; speaking of the wickedness of man, it is said, <HI>the imagi∣nation of the thoughts of his heart are only evil
<PB N="72" REF="016775_0071_0F9E243A31E963B8"/>
continually.</HI>—But what would they infer from these words? Was the wickedness of the antediluvian world referred to in <HI>Gen.</HI> vi. 5, their natural corruption and depravity? If it was then this natural corruption is not universal, since <HI>Noah</HI> must be excepted who was a just man, perfect in his generations and walked with God, see the 9th verse: Or was this wickedness an evidence of their natural cor∣ruption? If so, then by parity of reason <HI>Adam</HI> himself was naturally, or as he came into existence, corrupt, for he eat the forbidden fruit; and the angels, at least many of them, were created vicious beings, for they revolted from the <HI>Almighty:</HI> Or, does the evidence of the natural corruption of the human race depend upon the universality of the corruption and depravity of mankind referred to? Then certainly <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> were naturally de∣praved; for, when they only were existent, mankind were surely universally depraved and that without any exception; whereas there was one man righteous in the age referred to. Hence it is very apparent that the corruption of mankind in the age referred to, was nei∣ther <HI>natural</HI> corruption <HI>itself,</HI> nor an <HI>evidence</HI> of it. It is the unhappiness of some Gen∣tlemen, that they ascribe to human nature simply as existing, what belongs to it only as men have corrupted it by a long course of continued impiety: Thus they make all men
<PB N="73" REF="016775_0072_0F9E243ADD21CB50"/>
children of wrath by nature, from the Apostle's words to the <HI>Ephesians,</HI> ii. 2, 3. which evidently relate to their former state of Heathenism, when they lived in gross idolatry and under the government of the prince of darkness, as the context plainly shows. Is it a just and conclusive method of reasoning, to argue from the state of human nature, when corrupted by actual sins and rebel∣lions, to its state and condition as it comes into existence? Because human nature is capable of being viciated, and is in fact viciated, by personal wickedness, therefore it is vicious as it proceeds from the finishing hands of its maker? Because the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of a moral wicked agent are evil, therefore the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of one who is not a moral agent, <HI>viz.</HI> an infant, are evil? Because the scriptures inform of a man, or number of men, who by a con∣tinued course of wickedness, had contracted fixed habits of villainy to that degree that all their thoughts and imaginations were evil, shall we take this to be a <HI>full</HI> and <HI>express</HI> scripture assertion that men are born into the world vicious and depraved? If a man in a long course of open impiety, is finally left of God to commit murder, and dies on a gibbet, is this an indubitable evidence that he was born into the world a wicked wretch, with a murderous disposition? It seems so, or <HI>Gen.</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="016775_0073_0F9E243BE9948BE8"/>
vi. 5. would never have been cited in proof of the state of mankind by nature, or as they came into the world. If such reasoning is not to be allowed, then the text cited is not to the purpose.</P>
<P>The next scripture cited by the committee as <HI>expressly</HI> asserting that man is born into the world with a corrupt and vicious nature, is <HI>Job</HI> xiv. 4, <HI>'Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.'</HI> Let the reader only turn his attention to the preceeding verses of the chapter, and he will find that the cleanness and uncleanness referred to in the words as they stand connected with the context, have no reference at all to moral evil, but only and simply to the shortness, vanity and afflictions of the present life— that we are liable to many evils in the pre∣sent state; our days are few and trouble∣some, we are cut down like a flower, and flee as a shadow. As parents are frail and mor∣tal, so they propagate a frail and mortal na∣ture, for nothing can be more perfect than its original: This is <HI>Job</HI>'s reasoning, and the evident design of the words: How then is native corruption and viciousness expressly as∣serted in these words, when they have no manner of relation to any such thing.</P>
<P>The next <HI>full</HI> and <HI>express</HI> scripture for na∣tural depravity used by the <HI>Committee,</HI> is <HI>John</HI> iii. 6. <HI>'That which is born of the Flesh
<PB N="75" REF="016775_0074_0F9E243C93093AE0"/>
is Flesh.'</HI> i. e. that which is born in the sense <HI>you Nicodemus</HI> speak of, is but a mere man constituted of body and soul, or the mere con∣stitution and powers of a man in their natural state, and so not fit for the vision of God be∣cause not holy; therefore our saviour informs him that a different birth was necessary in order to qualify for the kingdom of God, viz. a spiritual one: But not a word is there here about original depravity, or that we are born vicious.</P>
<P>Another <HI>express</HI> scripture is <HI>Eph.</HI> ii. 3. which we have mentioned already to have reference to a state of heathenism, and needs nothing further said upon it.</P>
<P>The committee proceed—"That man de∣rives a corrupt nature from <HI>Adam</HI> is abun∣dantly plain from <HI>Gen.</HI> v. 3. And <HI>Adam</HI> be∣gat a son in his own likeness, after his image; not after the image of God, in which we read man was first made, <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 27, <HI>'God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him,'</HI> but in his cor∣rupted fallen likeness." Powerful reasoning! <HI>Adam</HI> begat a son in his likeness, and what would they infer from this? So the in∣feriour orders of creatures, according to a di∣vine establishment, beget their young in their likeness: Is this an evidence of natural viciousness? No more, I fancy, is intended by the words, than that <HI>Adam,</HI> as a worker,
<PB N="76" REF="016775_0075_0F9E243EAF4B50A8"/>
together with God, begat an human reasona∣ble creature, and therefore in his likeness; <HI>i. e.</HI> he begat a man like himself, having the same nature that God had given him. That it has no reference to the qualities and pro∣pensities of <HI>Adam</HI>'s mind, or his son's, is evi∣dent, unless minds are propagated as bodies are, by natural generation, and <HI>Adam</HI> was the father of <HI>Seth</HI>'s spirit, as he was of his flesh: And if this be the case, I see not why one moral quality may not be propagated as well as another; holiness as well as sin, vir∣tue as well as vice; for viciousness is no more of the essence of the mind than virtue. If then minds are propagated in the same man∣ner as bodies are the qualities of these minds are in like manner propagated, for they are not to be separated in any given instance; by consequence an holy mind will propagate an holy mind, and <HI>vice versa:</HI> In the same manner that a vicious moral quality may be propogated, in the same manner a virtuous moral quality may be propogated. If this reasoning be not good, let the fallacy be shewn. But the truth is, moral viciousness has its seat in the mind, and the Almighty is the direct and immediate author of the hu∣man mind, and therefore stiled in the scrip∣tures the father of our spirits, <HI>Heb.</HI> xii. 9.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">That God is the direct and immediate author of the human mind is a proposition I shall at present take for granted; when the truth of it is called in question and disputed, I stand ready to prove it.</NOTE>
<PB N="77" REF="016775_0076_0F9E243FC90B9CE0"/>
and said to form the spirit of man within him, <HI>Zech.</HI> xii. 1. Hence if <HI>Adam</HI>'s son had any vicious qualities in his mind connate with the existence of it, God placed them there, from whom his mind immediately derived, which makes the pure and holy God the au∣thor and prime source of all the wickedness that ever existed among the human race: But, <HI>'are not my ways equal?'</HI> saith the Al∣mighty. May <HI>he</HI> defend us from such a <HI>blasphemous imputation!</HI>—I would here just observe that the word <HI>own,</HI> which the Com∣mittee appear to place the stress of their rea∣soning from <HI>Gen.</HI> v. 3, upon, is not in the original, but supplied by the translators, and the text ought to be read thus—<HI>'And A∣dam begat in his likeness, in his image:'</HI> To make it therefore an emphatical word is quite unjustifiable.</P>
<P>From what has already been observed, is not this consequence unavoidable, <HI>viz.</HI> that mankind are not corrupt and vicious as they come into the world? It is capable, I think of demonstration that whatever viciousness there is in the human mind, as it comes in∣to existence, must proceed from God equally with the mind itself. Does it not appear vain then for any man to reason from those words <HI>Gen.</HI> v. 3, to prove derived viciousness, when agreeable to such reasoning this vicious∣ness must derive immediately from the
<PB N="78" REF="016775_0077_0F9E244062E5A3B8"/>
deity? Further, are these Gentlemen of the Committee absolutely certain that <HI>Adam,</HI> when he begat <HI>Seth,</HI> was not a convert, a truly religious and holy man? He was now 130 years old, and had lived nearly as long under the gospel dispensation; if he ever em∣braced the gospel and became a virtuous man, as has been always believed in the church, it is in the highest degree probable he was now a virtuous and godly man. And if moral pravity may be propagated by natural gene∣ration, as the Committee suppose, why not moral virtue also? And if moral virtue may be thus propagated, why is it not quite as likely <HI>Seth</HI> was born virtuous as vicious? I think it lies upon the Committee to make it evident that virtue cannot be propagated as well as depravity; or that <HI>Adam,</HI> when he begat <HI>Seth,</HI> was not a virtuous man. Until then I must look upon the argument from this text, in favour of the natural viciousness of mankind, as absolutely inconclusive and prodigiously uncharitable.</P>
<P>If the Gentlemen I oppose will avow the opinion, that minds are capable of division and multiplication, and therefore, like the ani∣mal part, are propagated by natural generati∣on, they might give a better account of their derived viciousness; although in this case to impute guilt to the posterity of <HI>Adam,</HI> and pu∣nish them on account of this derived vicious∣ness
<PB N="79" REF="016775_0078_0F9E24411FD5B438"/>
would be unjust and unequal, since it was by virtue of no act or choice of theirs— to which they had never given their assent or consent.</P>
<P>The next scripture they have seen fit to produce as <HI>express</HI> proof of our being born vicious, is <HI>Psalm</HI> li. 5. <HI>'I was shapen in ini∣quity, and in sin did my mother conceive me.'</HI> The words, agreeable to the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> ought to be rendered—<HI>'I was born in iniquity, and in sin did my mother nurse, or nourish me,'</HI> which words have no reference, I conceive, to his simple formation in his mother's womb, but import no more than that he was a great sinner, early went astray, and had contracted strong habits of vice. <HI>Job</HI> speaks of guiding the widow from his mother's womb, <HI>Job</HI> xxxi. 18. The wicked are said to go astray from the womb, as soon as born, speaking lies, <HI>Psalm</HI> lviii. 3, and the house of <HI>Jacob</HI> is called a transgressor from the womb, <HI>Isaiah</HI> xlviii. 8. These scriptures are of like import with the words of the Psalmist under consi∣deration, and intend no more than that they did these things very early, as soon as capable; not that <HI>Job</HI> guided the widow, the wicked went astray, and the Jews transgressed as soon as born, even in an infant state, for this was utterly impossible. If we take the words in the literal sense of our translation, it is mani∣fest <HI>David</HI> chargeth his sin and wickedness,

not upon himself, but upon some other per∣son; for, it will be granted on all hands, he did not shape and conceive himself: Who then shaped him? Answer, God, <HI>Psalm</HI> cxix. 73, and <HI>Job</HI> xxxi. 15. <HI>That God made us,</HI> is an unanswerable reply to all reasonings from such scriptures as these, or any other, to prove natural viciousness, and is an incon∣testable evidence that they are grossly misun∣derstood and abused, while strained to pa∣tronize such a <HI>blasphemous sentiment.</HI></P>
<P>The next scriptures advanced as being <HI>express</HI> in the case of derived viciousness, are "<HI>Rom.</HI> v. 12. <HI>Wherefore as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin, and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned</HI>—and 18, <HI>therefore as by the offence of one, judgment came upon all men to condemnation</HI>—and 19, <HI>by one man's disobedience many were made sin∣ners.</HI>" The Committee mean to prove from <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 12, that man derives a corrupt na∣ture from <HI>Adam, i. e.</HI> a nature morally cor∣rupt, or vicious—'<HI>Wherefore by</HI> one <HI>man, sin entered into the world:</HI>' Here the Apostle affirms that sin entered into the world by <HI>one</HI> man, <HI>i. e.</HI> Adam. <HI>'And death by sin.'</HI> What sin? Whose sin? Evidently <HI>Adam</HI>'s sin, his <HI>one</HI> sin of eating the forbidden fruit. <HI>'And so death passed upon all men."</HI> That is, by the <HI>one</HI> sin of the <HI>one</HI> man <HI>Adam,</HI> the whole hu∣man race became mortal. <HI>'For that all
<PB N="81" REF="016775_0080_0F9E24429F62A718"/>
have sinned.'</HI> How is this? Does the Apo∣stle here affirm, that <HI>all</HI> men have sinned, contradistinguishing sin from suffering? This would be to contradict himself in the same verse. He had just affirmed, that <HI>one</HI> man sinned, and that death came upon all for, or in consequence, of that <HI>one</HI> sin: Now to make him affirm in the last clause, that <HI>all</HI> have sinned, would make him palpably contradict himself. Further, it would not then be by <HI>one</HI> sin 'that death hath passed upon all men;' but by <HI>many</HI> sins, even the sins of all men, directly repugnant to the express words of the inspired writer. That mortality came into the world, and passed upon all men, by <HI>Adam</HI>'s <HI>one</HI> sin, is proved from the text: But that mankind derive a corrupt na∣ture from <HI>Adam</HI> is not <HI>expressed</HI> in the text most certainly; nor can it be inferred from any expression in the text, with the least sha∣dow of probability, except the last clause: And that the Apostle doth not mean to be literally understood in this clause, is undenia∣bly evident, unless he contradicts himself, which we may not suppose. He evidently means <HI>suffering</HI> by the word <HI>sin, suffered</HI> by <HI>sinned,</HI> as is very usual in the sacred writings. Further that St. <HI>Paul</HI> does not mean to af∣firm that all mankind sinned in <HI>Adam,</HI> is e∣vident from this, that he affirms all are liable to death, on account of <HI>Adam</HI>'s sin, which
<PB N="82" REF="016775_0081_0F9E2443ABE74DB8"/>
he would not have done, had he meant that all mankind had sinned, and so became liable to death on account of their own sin; which they would have been, had they all sinned in <HI>Adam.</HI></P>
<P>As to verses, 18th and 19th, cited by the Committee, I shall observe nothing upon them, the above being a full reply to any thing they can gather from those verses to prove what they undertook to establish from <HI>ex∣press scripture,</HI> viz. that man derives a cor∣rupt nature from <HI>Adam;</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The twelft<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> verse of <HI>Rom</HI> V. may be considered as a comment, or ex∣position upon 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>.22, as the Apostle is treating of the same matter though more at <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/> As a <HI>'Adam all die▪'</HI> cannot be taken literally, but thus, as in <HI>Adam</HI> all <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> mortal.—"Why St. <HI>Paul</HI> differs in his phrase here from what he used to the <HI>Corinthians,</HI> and prefers here that which is harder and more figurative, may perhaps, be easily accounted for, if we consider his stile and usual way of writing, wherein is shewn a great lik<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>g of the beauty and force of Anti<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>h<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>sis, as serving much to illustration and impression. In the 15th chapter of <HI>Corinthians,</HI> he is speaking of life restored by Jesus Christ, and to illustrate and fix that in their minds, the <HI>death</HI> of mankind best served: Here to the <HI>Romans</HI> he is discoursing of righteousness restored to men by Jesus Christ, and therefore here the term <HI>sin</HI> is the most natural and p<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>parest to set that off. But that neither ac∣tual or i<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ted sin is here meant, or v. 19, where the same way of expressi∣on is used, he that has need of it may see proved in Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> upon the place. If there can be any need of any other proof, when it is evidently contrary to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s design here, which is to shew, that all men, from <HI>Adam</HI> to <HI>Moses,</HI> died solely in consequence of <HI>Adam</HI>'s transgression, see verse 17.'—LOCKE.—See also Dr. <HI>Whitby,</HI> Dr. <HI>Taylor,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Chauncey</HI> on the place.</NOTE> but would here express my astonishment that any man, or number of men, unless professed Deists and Infidels, should thus abuse scripture, by a designed partial citation of it, as the Com∣mittee has done; I say designed, for I can∣not but suppose they were conscious, that a fair and full citation of the 18th and 19th

verses of <HI>Rom.</HI> v, would have made it appear to any one of common understanding who should read their report, that these scriptures were not to their purpose. I must entreat them for the future to pay a little more res∣pect to inspiration, than to abuse it in this manner, lest they fall under the heavy charge of handling the word of God <HI>deceitfully.</HI></P>
<P>The Committee then proceed to propound two questions, viz.</P>
<P N="1">I. If children are not polluted why then are they baptized?</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> Baptism is a seal of the covenant, the badge of Christ's disciples; and infants are baptized, to distinguish them from the world as such, by divide order: And not to wash away original sin as the Papists dream.</P>
<P N="2">II. Why necessary that infants be regene∣rated for the enjoyment of God?</P>
<P><HI>Answer.</HI> Because infants are not personal∣ly and inwardly holy as they come into be∣ing, though many of them are federally so, and therefore not fit for the enjoyment of God, or the kingdom of glory; for with∣out holiness no one shall see the Lord.</P>
<P>Thus after misinterpreting and misapply∣ing the above scriptures, and propounding two questions; as if conscious of victory and that truth was with them, they close their observations upon this first article in the fol∣lowing words—"Thus EVIDENT it

is <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">What is evident? <HI>It is evident</HI> to <HI>any candid</HI> and <HI>impartial mind,</HI> that this nameless Committee, whoever they be, have espoused a system of reli∣gious notions, which they mean to use as an <HI>infallible standard</HI> and <HI>test</HI> of <HI>orthodoxy:</HI> And that though this favourite system cannot be <HI>proved,</HI> not <HI>de∣fended</HI> by scripture, it being neither expressed or implied therein, yet all those who take the liberty to dissent from it, as all must who search and ex∣amine the scriptures for themselves, must be said to want <HI>candour</HI> and <HI>im∣partiality.</HI> Again, <HI>it is evident,</HI> this Committee have some new meaning to the phrase <HI>express scriptures,</HI> or else that this assertion of theirs, "that mankind are born into the world with a corrupt and vicious nature," is not proved by <HI>express scripture.</HI> For certainly this proposition is no where to be found in the Bible, lying in these words: If the Committee therefore mean by <HI>express scripture</HI> such as express a proposition in which it is affirmed, as man∣kind generally do, then there is no <HI>express</HI> scripture for the proposition above; and they who affirm there is, must acknowledge themselves to be greatly mistaken in so doing. If they mean by <HI>express scriptures,</HI> such texts as are to be found <HI>written</HI> in the <HI>Bible,</HI> whether they have any reference or not to the matter to be proved by them, it may be confessed their proposition is proveable from <HI>express scripture;</HI> for there are a great number of texts <HI>writ∣ten</HI> in the <HI>Bible,</HI> that have no manner of reference to such a proposition; though but very few that have less reference to it, than those cited by the Committee, as <HI>express</HI> scriptures in proof of it. If they mean by <HI>express scriptures,</HI> that the words of a proposition proved as theirs is, by <HI>express</HI> scriptures, may be all found, lying in different parts of the Bible, and so must be picked by partial citations, and brought together, in order to form the proposition; I acknowledge this proposition may be proved by <HI>express scrip∣ture;</HI> for all the words of the proposition above are undoubtedly to be found somewhere in the Bible. And one would think the last is the meaning the Committee put to the words <HI>express scripture,</HI> because they have made at∣tempts to prove their proposition by partial citations from the scriptures. Again, it is evident, the Committee found themselves destitute of scripture evidence in support of the <HI>Calvinistick,</HI> and therefore orthodox notion, that man is born into the world with a vicious and sinful nature, and by conse∣quence found themselves under a necessity, in several instances, to injure the scriptures by partial citations; hereby making them appear to favour their notions, when otherwise they would not. Again, it is evident that those who make such a blundering business of proving their own creed, were ne∣ver divinely authorised to make creeds for others, or to judge and condemn others creeds. There are many other things which are very evident, but as they would not be for the credit and reputation of the Committee, we con∣tent ourselves with only mentioning those things which are for their <HI>honour.</HI></NOTE> to every candid and impartial mind, that man is born into the world with a sinful na∣ture, not in the moral image of God, conse∣quently not free from guilt or desert of pu∣nishment" !!!—But where is the evidence of these conclusions?

whence these unaccountable consequences result? "Man born into the world with a sinful nature." If this be true, God is the au∣thor of this sinfulness, as he is the author of man's nature; this I have shewn. "Man not now made in the moral image of God." If by the moral image of God, these Gentle∣men intend holiness; I am not their oppo∣nent, never supposing that we were born, in this sense, holy.—I know of no scripture that says that any man was ever born, or ever made in the image of God in this sense, that he was made holy: If the Committee will pro∣duce one <HI>express</HI> scripture (as, upon this sub∣ject they deal altogether in <HI>express</HI> scriptures) to prove that any one man ever came out of the hands of God an holy creature, the sen∣timent shall, at once, have a place in my creed Perhaps <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 27, will be cited as an <HI>express scripture</HI> in the case—<HI>'So God made man in his own image, in the image of God made he him.'</HI> Very true, so man was made in the image of God after the flood, which is given as a reason against murder, and that the murderer should be punished with death, see <HI>Gen.</HI> ix. 6, <HI>'Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed: For in the</HI> image <HI>of God made he man,'</HI> Both in <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 27, and ix. 6, the original word translated <HI>image</HI> is the very same: To say therefore, that the image of God in <HI>Gen.</HI> i.

However, it lies upon the Committee to prove that the image of God, <HI>Gen.</HI> i. 27, was holiness; and upon such an important point, I shall receive no∣thing, as proof, but <HI>express</HI> scripture; for I do not suppose that such a cardinal point in the system of some men's divinity, is left to be spelt out, and inferred by way of conse∣quence from implicit and doubtful scriptures; which, when they shall have produced, these <HI>express</HI> scriptures will equally prove that men in <HI>Noah</HI>'s time, and by consequence to the end of the world, were made, in like manner, in the image of God, <HI>i. e. holy.</HI>—That men after the flood were in the image of God, and his favourites, as they came in∣to being, equally with <HI>Adam,</HI> is further ma∣nifest from the original blessing being repeat∣ed, without any variation, except a little en∣largement, and pronounced on the future

Not surely with me, but with their own shadow—with a man of straw of their own manufacture. Did I ever contradistinguish obedience from faith, either in public or pri∣vate? Would this anonymous committee hold the public in hand that I fancy obedience, in distinction from faith, is the only condition of the covenant of grace? It seems so; and herein they have abused me, and imposed upon the public. Could they imagine me so weak and childish? A just cause needs no such measures to support it.<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Had the Gentlemen who sat in Consociation of late at <HI>West-Stafford</HI> dropt their popish claim of authority; rejected the words <HI>require</HI> and <HI>judge</HI> in their <HI>subpoena;</HI> and <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ted me to a friendly conference as their bro∣ther and equal, I might, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="3 letters" DISP="•••"/>ew words, have given them full satisfaction respecting this, and perhaps some other points of difference; but this could not be obtained—I could have appeared before them in no other character than that of a criminal at the bar of his judges waiting the fatal sentence: This re∣ligion and conscience would not suffer me to do. And I have the pleasure since that time, to find that I am not the only instance of this nature that ever happened in this State.—The Rev. Mr. <HI>Noyes,</HI> former minister at <HI>New-Haven,</HI> was suspected by the Corporation of Yale College, of corruptness in the faith; they took it upon them therefore to call this <HI>aged father</HI> to ex∣amination, as having authority over him, "Or in plain English (as the the Rev. Mr. <HI>Hart</HI> of <HI>Saybro<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>k</HI> says, from whom I have the account) they acted towards him, on this occasion, not as friends and brethren, but as <HI>in∣quisitors.</HI>" He told them plainly that they had no right to examine him in such a manner, and that he would not be thus examined by them—"And in this," says Mr. H. "he did great honour to himself, and made a noble stand against the encroachments of arbitrary power." After this, the Cor∣poration cited him in form, <HI>required</HI> him, I suppose, to appear before them at another session, and submit himself to be examined by them. He ac∣cordingly appeared and denied their jurisdiction; they affirmed it, and ad∣journed the trial of the poor Gentleman's case to another time, and never called it again.—The late Consociation, in this instance, were not so wise, if the nameless Committee were of their number, as is suspected by some people.

of gospel obedience, equally with repentence, or any other religious exercise whatever, and declared to be such in the sacred pages, see <HI>John</HI> vi. 29, <HI>'Jesus answered and said unto them, this is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.'</HI> And 1 <HI>John</HI> iii. 23, <HI>'And this is his commandment, that ye should believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ."</HI> When I say obedience is the only condition, &amp;c. I do, and ever did, include faith as an act of obedience equal with any exercise whatever, either of mind or body, and in∣deed the first act in the series; for I never supposed that men would obey the gospel while their minds did not assent to the gos∣pel as true, and from God. The Committee seem to suppose that the blessings of the new covenant are suspended on faith, as dis∣tinguished from obedience, and would father this distinction on St. <HI>Paul</HI> in the words by them cited; but this is an evident pervertion of his obvious sense and meaning: The plain design of the Apostle in this chapter is to convince the Jews that they had no pre∣tence to glory, or exalt themselves above the
<PB N="91" REF="016775_0090_0F9E244D23A4C568"/>
Gentiles, now in the time of the gospel be∣cause descended from <HI>Abraham:</HI> But how does he do this? Why first, by shewing them that their father <HI>Abraham</HI> was justified by faith, and so had not whereof to glory, since he received righteousness as a gift, and not a debt by obedience to the legal dispen∣sation. Secondly, Because neither they of the circumcision, nor they who had the law, but they only who had faith were the seed of <HI>Abraham,</HI> to whom the promise was made. Therefore the blessing of justification was intended for the Gentiles, and bestowed on them, as well as on the Jews, and upon the same ground. The opposition therefore the Apostle makes between faith and work, in the 5th and 6th verses, is not an opposition between faith and work in obedience to the gospel of Christ, as the Committee would feign have it; but between faith and work in obedience to the Jewish law, to which the Jews were surprizingly attached, and in obe∣dience to which they looked for righteous∣ness and life. To impute righteousness in the 6th verse, and not to impute sin in the 8th, intend the same thing, as <HI>Locke</HI> well ob∣serves, the Apostle in these two verses using these two expressions as equivalent; which import no more than that God does not reckon, or put sin to the account of any one. By thus mistaking the design and meaning of
<PB N="92" REF="016775_0091_0F9E244DD62ADDA0"/>
St. <HI>Paul</HI> in those verses, the Gentlemen have unhappily ran into the error that we are justified by a faith distinct from, and no part of gospel obedience; and this unlucky mis∣take was the only reason why they fell out with the article, and voted it dangerous. I could wish this Committee would give us a description of their faith as contradistinguish∣ed from gospel obedience, that we might know what it is, and how it looks; for I freely confess I can obtain no idea of such a faith, nor in any measure determine what it is the likeness of.</P>
<P>After observing that holiness is necessary to happiness, and that the gospel contains the most weighty arguments to universal obedi∣ence, they observe, "That this obedience is the fruit of an union with Christ, and it can no more exist without this union, than the branch severed from the vine can bear fruit," and cite <HI>Rom.</HI> iv. 5, and xi. 6. What these two verses are cited for, it is utterly beyond me to discover, unless cited with an "how∣ever they are to be understood"—as a text of scripture is cited by the Rev. Mr. <HI>Buck∣minster,</HI> in a late pamphlet, p. 38, which is quite a modern method of citation, and ad∣ducing proofs from the Bible in this manner, one scripture will answer the purpose as well as an<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>er: However, agreeable to what the Committee say above, faith and saving union

with Christ are antecedent to obedience, or any good influence gospel motives can have upon the human mind: Therefore believ∣ing is no act of obedience, though a com∣manded duty: Therefore those weighty gospel arguments to universal obedience are motives to none but those who are united to Christ: Therefore the unregenerate, with respect to religion and eternity, are not free agents: Therefore the gospel is of no advan∣tage to them. Are these notions according to Godliness?</P>
<P>ART IV. &amp;c. Owned and defended: Voted unscriptural and dangerous according to charge. My defence, it seems, was their only evidence; but let me ask this Commit∣tee, did I ever own and defend the above ar∣ticle in the words in which it stands? This you have asserted in your condemnatory re∣port although what you assert is utterly be∣side the truth, and openly abusive: Doubt∣less you had my defence in your hands, or at command; in which defence I maintain the proposition, not in the words of the ar∣ticle which you have had the boldness to say I owned and defended, but in the words following—"That we have all power <HI>ne∣cessary</HI> to do what the gospel requires of us <HI>in order</HI> to our <HI>taking benefit thereby,</HI> is what I affirm." These words convey a very differ∣ent idea from the words of the article, and
<PB N="94" REF="016775_0093_0F9E244F68A29E50"/>
import no more than that '<HI>God is not an hard master,</HI> reaping <HI>where he has not</HI> sowed, <HI>and</HI> gathering <HI>where he has not</HI> strewed.' <HI>Matth.</HI> xxv. 24. The only sentiment I meant to maintain in the above sentence out of my defence, in my public discourses, and private conversation, was and is simply this, that the father of mercies does not require any of his creatures to exercise a power they have not, or perform an impossibility as a condition of his favour, or of their taking benefit by Christ's gospel; and if the Com∣mittee, or any other man, will avow the contrary, they alone must bear the sin and shame of it; as, if I have any consistent ideas of the divine character, it would be a most vile reflection upon the equity and goodness of the great parent of men and angels, and a reproach to the benevolence of the saviour, and the design of his gospel.—The Com∣mittee proceed; "Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> wholly ex∣plodes the distinction between natural and moral power as foolish and ridiculous, and in his defence <HI>expressly</HI> asserts that we have all power <HI>necessary</HI> to do what the gospel requires of us, in order to <HI>inherit</HI> its blessings." I said, 'we have all power necessary to do what the Gospel requires of us in order to our <HI>taking benefit thereby:</HI>' These are my words <HI>verbatim</HI> as they stand in my defence. Now are these words, <HI>in order to inherit its bless∣ings,</HI>

an <HI>express</HI> repetition of these words, <HI>in order to our taking benefit thereby?</HI> It is evidently the case that these gentlemen have struck up a new meaning to the words <HI>ex∣press</HI> and <HI>expressly;</HI> this I had much rather suppose, than to imagine they meant to tell lies. The distinction between natural and moral power, as understood, applied, and defended by some modern continental writers, whereby they have grossly injured the di∣vine character, and even made the holy God the author of all wickedness, I disclaim: If any divine is pleased to call the power and exercises of the mind, moral power and mo∣ral exercises; and the power and exercises of the body natural; and will make and apply this distinction in such a manner as not to bear hard upon the moral character of the deity, I am not disposed to contend about words: But this I maintain, that whatever defect, either in mind or body, we brought into the world with us, and is coeval with our existence, is properly a natural defect. If there be an <HI>inability</HI> to holiness, and a <HI>pre∣vailing propensity</HI> to sin in the <HI>very nature</HI> of man as <HI>existing,</HI> so that he <HI>cannot</HI> will, nor <HI>act</HI> otherwise, until a <HI>physical</HI> exertion of di∣vine power upon his mind; I think this <HI>in∣ability,</HI> and this <HI>propensity,</HI> and the <HI>necessity</HI> resulting herefrom, is, to all <HI>intents</HI> and <HI>pur∣poses, natural,</HI> as it springs from his <HI>nature</HI>

and the <HI>very condition</HI> of his <HI>being.</HI> And as we are but the <HI>passive recipients</HI> of this na∣ture, which, with all its endowments and qualities, comes from the <HI>finishing hands</HI> of its <HI>divine author;</HI> so these two consequences, I think, will <HI>naturally</HI> and <HI>necessarily</HI> follow, viz. 1. That <HI>human nature</HI> in every man as he comes into the world, is not possessed of <HI>vicious</HI> and <HI>hateful</HI> qualities. 2. That God requires <HI>no more</HI> of us than the <HI>nature</HI> he has given us will enable us to perform. Therefore to say, we have a <HI>natural</HI> ability to do <HI>all</HI> the gospel requires of us in order to our taking benefit thereby, but not a <HI>moral;</HI> that a <HI>natural</HI> inability excuses, but a <HI>moral</HI> does not, is, I humbly conceive, evidently impertinent, and, which is much more, an insult upon the divine wisdom, justice and goodness; and not only so, but it is, I fancy, making a distinction between the powers of nature, that the bible knows nothing about. If the <HI>man,</HI> as an <HI>intelligent, accountable creature of God,</HI> is unable to perform a cer∣tain thing, let his inability be what you please, and give it what name you please, I would ask, First, Whether God requires the man to do this thing as a condition of his favour and grace, and will punish him eternally for not doing the thing, while he does not grant him power sufficient to overcome the resist∣ance to be met with in the doing of it?
<PB N="97" REF="016775_0096_0F9E2491D83E38F8"/>
Second, Whether an avowal of the affirma∣tive does not involve in it this proposition, viz. That the Almighty has suspended his favour and grace upon an impossible conditi∣on, and inflicts a penalty upon the non-per∣formance of this impossible condition? And Third, Whether this is not a gross reflection upon the divine character, by making God an hard master, reaping where he has not sow∣ed? &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Committee disclaim the notion of God's requiring natural impossibilities as they are pleased to call them, yet seem to suppose that God requires impossibilities in some sense, or other, for they go on to say—"But at the same time, must believe that man's inability to holiness is such as fully to justify those words of our saviour, <HI>John</HI> vi. 44, <HI>'No man can come unto me, except the father which hath sent me draw him.'</HI> And of the Apostle, <HI>Rom.</HI> viii. 7, <HI>'The carnal mind is not sub∣ject to the law of God, neither indeed can be."</HI> But are <HI>impossibilities</HI> required of us in ei∣ther of these scriptures? Far otherwise, I think: It is true, we cannot come to Christ in the sense of our saviour's words, without the drawing of the father; and it is as true we are not required to, without and separate from this drawing: We are capable of be∣ing drawn, we can be workers together with God, and neither more nor less is re∣quired
<PB N="98" REF="016775_0097_0F9E24924870F320"/>
of us in this affair: How then does the thing required exceed the ability to per∣form? As to the words of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> every body, I suppose, will grant that a carnal flesh∣ly mind, that is in pursuit of the things of the flesh, is not subject to God's law, and in∣deed cannot be remaining so; so our saviour informs us, that <HI>'no man can serve two ma∣sters;'</HI> but what is all this to the purpose? Because a man cannot convert himself with∣out divine help; because a carnal fleshly mind is not, and remaining such, cannot be subject to God's laws, <HI>i. e.</HI> because a man can∣not serve two masters: Does it therefore follow, First, That such scriptures are a <HI>proof</HI> of the distinction between natural and moral power, as the <HI>Committee</HI> would <HI>under∣stand</HI> and <HI>apply</HI> it? Second, That man is <HI>ut∣terly unable</HI> to do what the gospel requires in order <HI>partake</HI> of its <HI>benefits?</HI> And Third, That God <HI>requires impossibilities</HI> of his crea∣tures as a <HI>condition</HI> of the bestowment of his <HI>grace?</HI> It is <HI>surprizing</HI> that men should use Bible and reason in this manner!</P>
<P>But they proceed—"Should we admit that man hath full power to do all that the gospel requires of him, in every sense in which he might be said to possess it, we conceive we must then admit a principle of holiness in him naturally, in his fallen state, contrary to the word of God, or utterly deny the force of

<PB N="100" REF="016775_0099_0F9E2E41A86A5428"/>
this obedience, and exercise such a principle in order that divine grace be confered? If such opinions as these are couched under the above dark and ambiguous citation, it is de∣sired they would emerge out of obscurity, and in day-light avow the opinions, and not hide themselves in clouds, and darken counsel by words without knowledge. They conclude thus—"For to adapt the rule of duty to the bias of the depraved heart, is to make it what we please—and it is repugnant to all our notions of the perfections of the deity, that he should give his rational creatures such mutuable variable laws, for his laws are all like himself holy, just, and good immuta∣bly." Then God cannot publish a law of grace through a mediator, and suspend a pro∣mise of saving blessings upon the faithful and persevering endeavours of his sinful creatures as the condition of their bestowment: I say, God cannot do this, unless he renders his laws mutuable by <HI>adapting them to the bias of the depraved heart?</HI> He cannot in and through the great redeemer, publish liberty to captives upon a condition possible for them to perform, and not destroy the immutable holiness, justice and goodness of his own laws? What would they insinuate but something like this? The Gentlemen appear to me to be greatly confused in their notion of things, owing, I am persuaded, to their not making

the following necessary distinction, viz. be∣tween what is God's work, and what is ours in the affair of our salvation: To renew the mind is the work of God, divine grace is his gift,—Our business is to improve our ta∣lents in the best manner we are able; to exert our faculties in endeavouring after di∣vine grace in the way of God's appointment; to seek for divine wisdom as for silver, &amp;c. God does not require us to exercise a princi∣ple, power or faculty we have not, in order to the obtainment of any blessing whether temporal or eternal. For as <HI>Wollaston</HI> well observes, "If he has no such power, then his power of that kind and degree is nothing; and it is nothing that is required to be appli∣ed: Therefore nothing is required to be done."<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">WOLLASTON'S Religion of nature, &amp;c. p. 109.</NOTE> And Dr. <HI>Oswald</HI>—"A connection betwixt obligation, and power to fulfil the obligation, is apparent; and so inviolable, that if you set aside the latter, the former va∣nishes of course.

righteousness?</HI> But let us look into their scriptures, "<HI>Rom.</HI> iii. 28, <HI>A man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.</HI>" It is desired that the reader would particularly bear in mind what this and some following scrip∣tures are brought to prove, viz. "That the believer's justification before God is <HI>wholly</HI> on account of <HI>Christ's righteousness.</HI>" The Apostle's Words are, as cited by the Com∣mittee, <HI>'A man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law.'</HI> The consequence they would <HI>draw,</HI> and indeed it must be <HI>drawn,</HI> for it will <HI>never follow,</HI> is this, therefore we are justified <HI>wholly</HI> on account of Christ's righteousness: Because the Apostle tells the Jews that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the Jewish law, in obedience to which law they were seeking to be justified; that therefore we under the gospel are justi∣fied without obedience to the laws of Christ, though justified by faith, as the Apostle de∣clares in the words, which faith is an act of personal obedience to the Christian law, with∣out which no one can ever be justified. The Committee first contradict themselves, and then, to keep themselves in countenance, haul in St. <HI>Paul</HI> as favouring their absurdity. The next scripture cited by them is the 20th verse of the same chapter—<HI>'By the deeds of the law there shall no Flesh be justified in his fight;' i. e.</HI> by obedience to the law as <HI>meri∣torious</HI>
<PB N="105" REF="016775_0104_0F9E2E454B8D0418"/>
no <HI>man</HI> can be justified in his sight. But is this plainly caught us in the words, viz. that we are justified <HI>wholly</HI> on account of <HI>Christ's righteousness, without</HI> and <HI>separate</HI> from obedience to the <HI>laws</HI> of Christ; es∣pecially when the <HI>same Apostle,</HI> in the <HI>same chapter,</HI> verse 28th, <HI>asserts justification</HI> by <HI>faith,</HI> which <HI>faith</HI> is an <HI>act</HI> of <HI>gospel obedience?</HI> They proceed—"<HI>Titus</HI> iii. 7, <HI>That being justified by his grace, we shall be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life." i. e.</HI> we are justified by the grace and mercy of the gospel through Christ, and not by virtue of our own works as meritorious of so great a favour; though none but the obedient be∣liever is, or can be justified upon the gospel plan.—But from these words are we "<HI>plain∣ly taught</HI> that the <HI>believer's</HI> justification be∣fore God is <HI>wholly</HI> on account of <HI>Christ's righteousness"—i e.</HI> are we plainly taught a palpable contradiction? A gift bestowed upon me <HI>wholly</HI> on the account of another person, and yet suspended on a <HI>personal act</HI> of <HI>my own,</HI> as a <HI>prerequisite</HI> or <HI>condition</HI> of its <HI>bestowment,</HI> I look upon as a <HI>contradiction</HI> in <HI>terms</HI> They go on to cite "<HI>Rom</HI> v. 19, <HI>So by the obedi∣ence of one shall many be made righteous.</HI>" A∣nother instance of their abuse of scripture, by partial citations; whereas had they been ho¦nest enough to have cited the whole ve<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> any one <HI>conversant</HI> with the <HI>bible,</HI> wou<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>

have <HI>seen at once</HI> that this scripture was nei∣ther <HI>expressly</HI> nor <HI>implicitly</HI> to their purpose. But to take them on their own ground—If the Committee imagine St. <HI>Paul</HI> to speak in this and the preceeding verse, of <HI>that</HI> righte∣ousness, and <HI>that</HI> justification which is to <HI>life eternal,</HI> why will they insist upon making St. <HI>Paul</HI> contradict himself, by dreaming that this justification, and this being made righte∣ous, must exclude all reference to, and connection with, our personal obedience, when faith, which is an act of personal obedience to an express command of the gospel law, is expressly made a condition of our justificati∣on by St. <HI>Paul</HI> himself; yea, even in the words these Gentlemen themselves have had the hand<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ing of? They proceed next to give us the sum total of the above scriptures in the following words; "Can any thing be more evident from these and similar texts than that the matter of our justification be∣fore God is not our own personal defective obedience, but the all-perfect righteousness <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>f Christ imputed to us, and received by faith alone?" <HI>i. e.</HI> Can any thing be more evident, &amp;c. than that the matter of our justification before God is not our own personal defective obedience, but the all-perfect righteousness of Christ imputed to us, and received by <HI>an act of personal obedience.</HI> How is it possible that men can reason thus, and drag conse∣quences

in this manner; men who look upon themselves divinely authorised to be the judges of other people's creeds, and to justify or condemn them at pleasure? But perhaps what follows will relieve the diffi∣culty; "This righteousness of Christ is the <HI>sole</HI> and <HI>exclusive ground</HI> of our pardon and acceptance with God and <HI>justification</HI> at the <HI>Redeemer's bar.</HI>"<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>This assertion of the Committee is contradictory, in my opinion, First, To themselves.

Second, To the express declaration of the redeem∣er himself. Where the bar of the redeemer is, his Apostle has told us, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 10.

Hence we see that our final doom will be fixed, not by virtue of the righteousness of another, or our interest in it, but according to our moral behaviour while in a state of trial and discipline. "We shall be judged by the grace and mercy of the gospel, and not by the rigours of unrelenting justice.

<P>Fourth, If Christ's righteousness be the <HI>sole</HI> and <HI>exclusive</HI> ground of our pardon and acceptance with God and justification at the redeemer's bar, I see not why an holy life in obedience to the laws of Christ, is not utterly and eternally excluded, and men j<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ed and glorified here and hereafter in all their sins.</P></NOTE> But how do they make

Why, "<HI>Rom.</HI> x. 4. <HI>For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that be∣lieveth" i. e.</HI> the design and end of the law was to bring men to Christ, that by believing in him, in obedience to his gospel, they might obtain justification.

Our final justifi∣cation and acquittal at the redeemer's bar is a subject as foreign, I conceive, from the design of St. <HI>Paul</HI> in the 10th chapter to the Ro∣mans as any subject can possibly be conceived to be, and any text within the limits of the sacred canon would have answered the pur∣pose just as well.

I also cite <HI>Rev</HI> xxi. 7. <HI>'He that overcometh shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son;'</HI> and infer that we are not finally justified at the redeemer's bar by the righteousness of Christ, <HI>solely</HI> and <HI>exclusively,</HI> but by our own works; and this inference is, at least, implicitly contained in the words; whereas <HI>Rev.</HI> vii. 14, is far from appearing either expressly or implicitly to their pur∣pose.

And is it not through Christ that our works of righteous∣ness in obedience to the gospel, though im∣perfect, meet the divine approbation and the reward of life? yea, is it not through Christ that we are granted even a state of trial for a future happy life? We are not absolved at last by virtue of our works, but with an eye to Christ as our daysman in whose advocate∣ship we are interested, and through whom our persons and imperfect services find ac∣ceptance: Nevertheless, whatever Christ has done for us, and whatever interest we may be supposed to have in him, or his righte∣ousness; <HI>it is a truth</HI> according to godliness, and obvious to the reason of mankind, that if we are not found at last to have obeyed the gospel, we never shall be justified at the re∣deemer's bar, nor rewarded with life; he will say unto all such, <HI>I know you not:</HI> On the contrary he who obeys the gospel in this world, shall meet a divine reward in the kingdom of his father, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 7, 8, 9, 10. 1 <HI>Peter</HI> iv. 17. <HI>John</HI> xii. 17.

<PB N="112" REF="016775_0111_0F9E2E4D0B28CFC0"/>
and righteous judge of the world have any regard to personal merit and demerit in distributing rewards and punishments among his creatures? And by consequence, how can he have any regard to moral worth and ex∣cellency, though a particular regard to perso∣nal merit and deme it, to moral worth and excellency, are inseparable from the idea of the moral government, and a state of trial? This is to subvert not only <HI>revealed religion,</HI> but <HI>natural religion</HI> also, and to <HI>demolish</HI> at <HI>one blow</HI> the <HI>whole government</HI> of the <HI>deity,</HI> whether <HI>natural</HI> or <HI>moral.</HI> For these rea∣sons, with others that might be mentioned, I am still constrained to believe, with Christ and his Apostles, that our works in obedience or disobedience to the gospel will be the ground of the divine procedure at the great day, and according to which our final state will be determined; especially as the gospel is God's rule of government at present with respect to all those under the light of it; for I cannot persuade myself to believe that God, whose rules of government are perfect regu∣larity and right, will have one rule of govern∣ment, and another and different rule of judg∣ment and final retribution. As to the reasons you have offered, and the scriptures you have adduced in support of the negative, they ap∣pear to me utterly inconclusive, and nothing to the purpose; and it is surprising to me, as
<PB N="113" REF="016775_0112_0F9E2E50DF559758"/>
well as to many others, that you should, with such a preremptory air, pronounce the article <HI>unscriptural</HI> and <HI>dangerous, opposite to,</HI> and <HI>subversive</HI> of, the <HI>gospel method</HI> of <HI>salva∣tion,</HI> upon such slight evidence, which in reality is no evidence at all! But what lengths will not indiscreet zeal and bigotry carry men! If you have heavier artillery to bring up, pray exhibit it—let the truth ap∣pear; I engage for myself to yield to scrip∣ture and reason, and appear on the side of the truth as it is in Jesus, though I mean not to be dragooned into a creed, or out of one. With me it is a very small thing that I should be judged of you, or of man's judgment; he who judgeth me is the Lord.</P>
<P>ART. VI. &amp;c. Voted, proved according to charge: "For the reasons, say they, we re∣fer to the texts cited under the preceeding ar∣ticle." For the reasons of what, pray? For the reasons why Christ righteousness is not sufficient, &amp;c. Do they mean to deviate into truth by avowing the article? Or are we re∣ferred to the texts cited under the preceeding article for the reasons why it is voted proved according to charge? But perhaps they de∣signed to vote the article <HI>unscriptural</HI> and <HI>dangerous according to charge,</HI> agreeable to con∣stant usuage in this case; but it slipped their minds through a multiplicity of creed judg∣ing business: Or perhaps it was <HI>lapsus pennoe</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="016775_0113_0F9E2E520BA40E88"/>
of the scribes; or perhaps — However, if they suppose the article contrary to <HI>express</HI> scripture as the others are, I would propound this simple question, viz. Whether the suf∣ferings of Christ and his righteousness are designed to save people in their sins? But as it is entirely uncertain what the Committee's design was, we can do no more than <HI>for the reasons</HI> to refer the reader to our observations upon their defence of the negative of the preceeding article, and wait until the obscu∣rity is removed from this part of their report by another oracular response.</P>
<P>ART. VII. &amp;c. Proved by vote. "It is proved in the opinion of the Consociation that Mr. <HI>Foster</HI> explodes the idea of personal election, particularly in a Sermon delivered at the ordination of his son <HI>Daniel,</HI> pages 50 and 51." The words referred to in my Ser∣mon are as follows; "Did I believe and teach, as some do, that God from all eternity elected to glory by an absolute decree, a cer∣tain number of men, whom he foresaw un∣done by <HI>Adam</HI>'s fall, appointed his son to un∣dertake their redemption, who was to satis∣fy justice, merit glory, and make them phy∣sically mete for it, leaving the rest under the dreadful decree of reprobation, to treasure up wrath against the day of wrath, without possibility of help," &amp;c. In this view of the decrees, I did, do still, and ever shall explode
<PB N="115" REF="016775_0114_0F9E2E521FB7FAD8"/>
them, while I believe there is a God, and that his ways are equal: And it is in this view of them the committee must avow them, if they would oppose me.</P>
<P>As to the article as it lies in the report of the Committee, it was known I denied it. They go on to say: "This doctrine," (<HI>i. e.</HI> the doctrine of election as represented in the above citation out of my sermon, for it is in that sense they avow the doctrine) "is <HI>plain∣ly</HI> and <HI>fully</HI> taught in <HI>divine revelation</HI>"!! What! is it <HI>plainly</HI> and <HI>fully</HI> taught in <HI>divine revelation</HI> that God from all eternity elected to glory, by an <HI>absolute</HI> decree, a certain number of men in such a manner as to de∣note a leaving the rest under the dreadful de∣cree of reprobation, to perish without possi∣bility of help? It seems so, or they are not my opponents: But where are the scriptures in support of such a gloomy, fatal doctrine? Have these men the confidence to appeal to the Bible for proof of such a suggestion? Yes, they can first charge God foolishly,<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>Predestination, a doctrine shocking, and manifestly contrary to all the notions men naturally have of God, a<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> wise, just and good being, was opposed by <HI>Arminius;</HI> who left behind him a man better qualified <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> himself, to carry on the cause he had espoused, I mean the great <HI>Episcopi∣us;</HI> whose writings soon flew all ove<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> <HI>Europe,</HI> and were much read by the divines of the church of <HI>England,</HI> and so ver<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>y good purpose; for soon after <HI>Calvanism</HI> vanished from amongst them quite and clean.</Q> CLARKE'S Essay on Study, p. 13, 1<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>.</NOTE> by charging him with making intelligent crea∣tures to damn them and then go to his word for proof of it—"<HI>Eph.</HI> i. 11. <HI>In whom also

It happens very un∣lucky to the Committee that these citations from the Bible, in proof of <HI>personal absolute</HI> election, have no reference at all to any e∣lection of that nature, but only and simply to the call of the Gentiles in the kingdom of the Messiah by the publication of the gospel among them, as might easily be made to ap∣pear, and is fully shown by LOCKE in his Paraphrase, &amp;c. It is strange there cannot be the words <HI>predestinated, chosen, elect, ordain∣ed,</HI> &amp;c. in a text of scripture, but it is at once taken as proof of a personal, eternal, absolute election, whether they have reference to any such thing or not. In truth the notion is absolutely without Bible and reason. For further satisfaction I refer to my reply to the Rev. Mr. <HI>Buckminster,</HI> where the affair of the decrees is treated more at large.</P>
<P>ART. VIII. &amp;c. "This article, say they, is proved according to charge in the judg∣ment of this council in the sermon Mr. <HI>Fos∣ter</HI> preached at Mr. <HI>Joel Foster</HI>'s ordination,"
<PB N="117" REF="016775_0116_0F9E2E5391FB4968"/>
and then proceed; "This Consociation doubt not the sufficiency of the merits of the saviour for the whole world; but it will not hence follow that Christ died for all intention∣ally alike, or that one as much as another is given to Christ." To say that the merits of Christ are sufficient for the redemption and salvation of the whole world, yet that it was the divine purpose that but a remnant should be redeemed and saved; and therefore the benefits of our Lord's salutary passion, in the divine counsel and design, and in the applica∣tion of them, are restrained to this remnant, appears to me inconsistent with the diffusive goodness and beneficence of the father and friend of men, and not coincident with the character God has seen fit to assume in rela∣tion to the human race; as a God who tak∣eth no pleasure in the death of him who dieth; who would have all men be saved, &amp;c. and is in effect to say, that Christ died no more for the non-elect, or those who, even∣tually, are not saved, than for the devils them∣selves who are reserved in chains, &amp;c. It leaves those for whom he did not die, under an impossibility of pardon and salvation; faith in Christ must be restrained to those for whom he intentionall died, the rest having nothing to believe respecting Christ, unless that his death was sufficient for their pardon and happiness, which is only to believe that God
<PB N="118" REF="016775_0117_0F9E2E54890FCB30"/>
could have saved them if he would; and what comfort would it be to a condemned male∣factor to know, that his prince could have pardoned and saved him, a price sufficient therefor having been paid, but he would not? The Committee proceed to cite <HI>"John</HI> xvii. 9, 20. <HI>I pray for them: I pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast given me, for they are thine. Neither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall be∣lieve on me through their word." 'I pray for them: I pray not for the world,'</HI> &amp;c. <HI>i. e.</HI> "I now offer up my prayer particularly for my Apostles who are designed for so great a work as preaching the gospel of the kingdom to both Jews and Gentiles, and therefore will stand in need of special divine assistance and support; but I do not now intercede for the world in general:" Though at other times we find him praying for the world both Jews and Gentiles; yea, even for his perse∣cutors and murderers, <HI>"Father forgive them for they know not what they do."</HI> "The sphere of his beneficence extended back∣wards to the foundation of the world, and reaches forward to the last conflagration; so that nothing, which is capable of being saved, is <HI>hid from the heat thereof.</HI> He be∣came the saviour of all ages, from the first birth of time to its last period; the father of mankind, from the rising up of the sun, to

But how debasing and dishonora∣ry the views of those who would confine the redemption and intercession of Christ to a small remnant of the human race! As to <HI>John</HI> vi. 37, the phrase <HI>to be given of the father</HI> does not signify the actual faith of those who are thus given, but only their pre∣paration and qualifications to believe, by be∣ing convicted by the wonderful works our saviour wrought, that he was the true Messi∣ah, and embracing him as such, laying aside their prejudices and carnal affections, which obstructed their coming to him; and by being persuaded of the truth, design and importance of the gospel and therefore receive and attend upon the duties of it: And all are given to Christ, who thus receive him and his gospel; but it is left with them whether they will be influenced by these means or
<PB N="120" REF="016775_0119_0F9E2E55CE39B940"/>
not, no force being put upon their minds, or their liberty of choice in the least infring∣ed; though as <HI>Chrysostom</HI> informs us, the <HI>Manichees</HI> made use of these words to de∣stroy man's free will; and therefore this fa∣ther, with St. <HI>Cyril,</HI> and others, observe, in opposition to the <HI>Manichees,</HI> that Christ in∣tends <HI>no more</HI> by the <HI>giving</HI> of the father, "but his revelation from above to a soul disposed to receive it." But what is this to the purpose of <HI>particular redemption?</HI> They conclude with the following remarkable rea∣soning; "If Christ died for all, as much for one as another, then if all do not actually par∣ticipate of the benefits of his death and at last arrive to heaven, his purpose and inten∣tion must be frustrated." Christ's intention to die for all is one thing; his intention to save all is another thing; what I maintain is, that Christ, of set purpose and design gave himself a ransom for all, and tasted death for every man, and therefore that his redempti∣on is equally extended with the race of man; and this his intention to die for all was abso∣lute; but his intention to save all, or any, is not absolute, but conditional; universal salva∣tion, and universal redemption are very dif∣ferent things, the former I deny, the latter I maintain. If the reasoning of the Commit∣tee is founded upon Christ's intention to die for all, it will stand thus; If it was Christ's
<PB N="121" REF="016775_0120_0F9E2E568BBDF370"/>
intention to die for all, and all are not saved, this his intention must be frustrated; but all are not saved—<HI>Ergo,</HI> The sophistry is minifest. If they refer to Christ's intention to save all, their reasoning is very foreign to the purpose, and effects not the truth of what I maintain.</P>
<P>The two last Articles, it seems, they got over without much difficulty.</P>
<P>The conclusion of the report of the Com∣mittee is in the following words and style— "Therefore <HI>we</HI> think ourselves <HI>holden</HI> in <HI>faithfulness</HI> on this occasion, to <HI>bear our open</HI> testimony against the abovementioned doc∣trines held and taught by Mr. <HI>Foster,</HI> as be∣ing <HI>not only contrary</HI> to the <HI>gospel,</HI> and of <HI>dan∣gerous tendency,</HI> but <HI>some</HI> of them <HI>at least even subversive</HI> of the <HI>Christian institution,</HI> and to say that <HI>we</HI> cannot but <HI>look</HI> upon these <HI>errors persisted in,</HI> as <HI>utterly unqualifying</HI> for the <HI>Christian ministry;</HI> and therefore that <HI>we</HI> cannot in <HI>conscience hold communion with the pastor who persisteth in them.</HI>"</P>

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE REVEREND ELDERS OF THE LATE CONSOCIATION AT WEST-STAFFORD.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>REVEREND SIRS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>WHEN I received a citation, signed, <HI>Theodore Hinsdale, Charles Backus,</HI> &amp;c. informing of the approach of your ve∣nerable body to <HI>judge</HI> upon articles of faith held and taught by me, and <HI>requiring</HI> me to make my appearance, as a criminal, at your bar, to answer to charges, &amp;c.—I was well convinced, from the <HI>haughty</HI> and <HI>assuming style</HI> and <HI>spirit</HI> of your <HI>mandatory</HI> citation, what I must expect as the issue of your in∣quisitory proceedings: Your first public ap∣pearance in the House of God at Stafford, and the temper and spirit which were con∣spicuous in every step of your conduct, pre∣saged a rash conclusion, and the event has fully justified my previous apprehensions. But suffer me, with the freedom of a Christian,
<PB N="125" REF="016775_0124_0F9E2E5BCF453DA0"/>
to expostulate with you; is not the Lord Je∣sus Christ the only lawgiver and king in his church, to whose authority and command, as to things of religion, Christians are bound to submit? Are not the scriptures of the Old and New Testament the only standard of religious truth? Has not every free and ac∣countable creature full and undisturbed right to search the scriptures, judge and be∣lieve for himself? Is religion any further praise-worthy than it is matter of choice? Are not these the principles which our first reformers asserted with so good effect against the arbitrary claims of the Romish church? And are they not the very basis and only support of the reformation? Granting these principles, and they must be granted, or the reformation from popery is evidently schis∣matical, is it not palpably inconsistent with them all, to imagine that Christ has given to any man, or body of men, authority in mat∣ters of religious faith, to whose decrees, in point of doctrine, Christians are obliged, and ought to submit? Is not the very claim of such authority equally and the same thing with a claim to infallibility? Has God given to any man, or body of men, authority in matters of faith, to whom he has not given infallibility? Then he has given to a man, or body of men, authority to lead men into error, a right to seduce and deceive: But let
<PB N="126" REF="016775_0125_0F9E2E5C8F2161F0"/>
it be granted, at present and for argument sake, that there is, and will always continue to be, a body of men upon earth, to whom Christ has given authority to decide in mat∣ters of religious faith, and to whose decisi∣ons Christians are subject, and ought to submit; I ask, Where shall we find this bo∣dy of men? Is it the Pope with his Cardi∣nals; or the king of <HI>England</HI> with his Par∣liament? Is it the Archbishop with his Bishops; or the Bishop of every diocese with his Dean and Chapter attending? Is it a Pres∣bytery or Synod; Association or Consociati∣on? Is it an ecclesiastical council, or a par∣ticular church? Is it any, or all of these? If all have this authority, then, by virtue of authority derived from Christ, Christianity may be made one thing in one country, and another thing in another country; in <HI>England</HI> it will be Episcopal; in <HI>Scotland</HI> a Presbyterian; in <HI>France</HI> a Popish; and in <HI>Prussia</HI> and <HI>Con∣necticut</HI> it will wear a Calvinistick form: But is Christ divided? Is this the unity of his kingdom? Is all this genuine Christiani∣ty? Then a man's religion must change with his change of climate, and this according to the will of Christ; then our separation from the church of <HI>Rome</HI> was a schismatical re∣bellion against the authority of Christ in his church. But if this authority does not re∣side equally in all these different bodies of
<PB N="127" REF="016775_0126_0F9E2E5DB8750890"/>
men, Which in particular has the only right∣ful claim to it? Is it a Consociation in <HI>Con∣necticut</HI> constituted of Elders and Messen∣gers? Then I ask, Where is the divine in∣stitution for such a body in the gospel, and where the charter vesting them with this high power? To what things and how far does this authority extend? Is it limited or unlimited? But I forbear—It never will be pretended that a <HI>Connecticut</HI> Consociation is of divine institution, or is constituted and vested with authority, in matters of faith, by a charter from Heaven: It is intirely a sy∣nodical institution, and <HI>Saybrook</HI> Platform is its charter: Whatever authority therefore is claimed and exercised by this body of men, by virtue of their institution and charter, is an authority not known in the New Testa∣ment, and by consequence is a bold usurpa∣tion of Christ's prerogative, and a stepping in∣to his throne who is the only lawgiver and king in the church; and every exercise of such authority is in fact spiritual tyranny, and to be disclaimed by all who would stand fast in the liberty wherewith Jesus Christ has made them free. If Christ is the only law∣giver and king in Zion; if the holy scriptures are the only standard of religious truth; if every free and accountable creature has full and undisturbed right to search the scriptures and judge for himself in all religious matters:
<PB N="128" REF="016775_0127_0F9E2E5E16068108"/>
and if religion is no further praise-worthy than it is matter of choice; if these things are so, can it be supposed that Christ has given others authority to disturb, censure and persecute Christians in the exercise of this right, a right which Christ himself gave, and commanded the exercise of it? God forbid! And if Christians in common have this liber∣ty, much more the Embassadors of Christ who are forbid to teach for doctrines the commands of men, but on the contrary are bound by office to teach the people all things whatsoever <HI>Christ</HI> has commanded them; to deliver the whole counsel of God; and to take heed to the ministry they have received of the <HI>Lord,</HI> that they fulfil it. By viewing the Lord Jesus Christ as only lawgiver, king and judge; by making the scriptures of truth his only rule of faith and practice; by using that liberty in the pursuit of divine knowledge which God has given him as a man, a Christian and a dispenser of the word of life; by preaching his own candid and impartial interpretations of scripture to the people of his charge, and when solemnly obliged hereto by his commission, as a ser∣vant of Christ, and accountable to him as supreme pastor; by these things does the faithful preacher justly expose himself to be judged, condemned, and excommunicated by his fellow servants, merely because he dif∣fers
<PB N="129" REF="016775_0128_0F9E2E5F37D25820"/>
from them in his interpretations of scripture, and does he expose himself to all these evils agreeable to the laws and rules of Christ's kingdom? Dare any presume this! To whom, pray, is an Embassador accoun∣table, but to the authority that commissions him as such?—With respect to the doctrines you have seen fit to condemn, though you had no right or authority from Christ so to do, I would expostulate with you—How is the opinion that mankind come into the world morally vicious and depraved, under the wrath and curse of God, and exposed to damnation consistent with the express decla∣rations of the holy Bible, that God is the fa∣ther of our spirits; formeth the spirit of of man within him; fashions us in the the womb; that his hands make and fashion us? Why will you make God the author of all wickedness? How can you believe that God is slow to anger and abundant in goodness, when he makes a creature such as it is, and then is angry even to wrath with the creature for being as it is? How can you suppose that obedience is not the only condi∣tion in the covenant of grace, when we read expressly in the Bible that Christ <HI>'being made perfect, became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him'?</HI> And that <HI>'he who doeth righteousness is righteous'?</HI> How can you entertain the opinion that men
<PB N="130" REF="016775_0129_0F9E2E5FCCBEC588"/>
have not both natural and moral power (if you are pleased to make this distinction) to do all that the gospel requires of them in order to their taking benefit thereby, when you hereby make the blessed God suspend the bestowment of saving benefits upon an impossible condition, and then eter∣nally punish his creatures for non-perfor∣mance; though God is said to be long-suf∣fering, not willing that any should perish? Is not this to make God an hard master, reaping where he has not sowed, and finally punish his creatures for nothing? How can you suppose that our good works are not the mat∣ter of our justification at the redeemer's bar, when obedience and disobedience are made the express conditions of our final justification and condemnation, <HI>Rom.</HI> ii. 7, and on—and when our works are made the only subject of enquiry at the great day, and when it is said that God will render to every man ac∣cording to his <HI>works?</HI>—How can you believe the doctrine of personal absolute e∣ternal election to everlasting life; that this election includes but a remnant of the hu∣man race, while the rest are passed by in God's eternal purpose and counsel, and left to perish without possibility of happiness, which, in other words, is to say, that God made the far greater part of men on purpose to damn them; I say, how can you embrace
<PB N="131" REF="016775_0130_0F9E2E604B71DAF8"/>
such an opinion, when the Bible expressly informs you that God hath no pleasure in the death of him that dieth, <HI>Ezek.</HI> xviii. 23, 31? What sincerity can there be in the ge∣neral offers of gospel blessings, and all the means and methods of God with men, to allure them to himself and happiness? I plain∣ly tell you, Gentlemen, that I look upon this doctrine reproachful to the divine character, and so long as I believe that God's <HI>tender</HI> mercies are over <HI>all</HI> the <HI>works</HI> of <HI>his hands,</HI> so long I shall continue to <HI>reject</HI> and <HI>detest</HI> such a doctrine.—How can you avow the notion of particular redemption when the Bible expressly informs you that Christ died for all in general, 1 <HI>Tim.</HI> iv. 10; for every man in particular, <HI>Heb.</HI> ii. 9—that he died for the whole world without exception, 1 <HI>John</HI> ii. 2.—without exception of the un∣godly, <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 6.—without exception of enemies, <HI>Rom.</HI> v. 10, and without exception of those who perish, 2 <HI>Peter</HI> ii. 1? How can men be said to render themselves worthy of sorer punishment for rejecting Christ and gospel grace, when, agreeable to this doctrine, Christ never died for them, gospel grace ne∣ver was purchased for, nor designed to be conferred upon them? May I be said to de∣serve a more severe punishment for rejecting a favour that was never designed for me? But reasoning upon so plain <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> subject seems

impertinent▪—I can assign no other reason why you have condemned these doctrines, and avowed their contraries, but an undue attachment to a particular system of opinions without free and impartial enquiry; adhere∣ing, with ut proper examination, to human creeds, confessions of faith, &amp;c. But to the <HI>law</HI> and to the <HI>testimony—the Bible, the Bi∣ble only is the religion of Protestants.</HI> Be en∣treated, Gentlemen, to pause one minute in your career, and view the ground you have gone over; lay aside indiscreet zeal, passion, and prejudice, and let reason ascend the throne and influence you to calm reflection. In your retired and solemn moments do you enjoy the serene pleasure of self-applause in a review of the measure you have meted out to me, and the church of God in <HI>West-Staf∣ford?</HI> Do you feel justified in your own minds, and do you, with confidence, expect ere long to meet the approbation of your judge the Prince of Peace? Can you, Re∣verend Sirs, I speak it with concern, can you be infatuated to that degree, after all that has been said, as to view yourselves invested with authority from Christ to dictate to the faith of your fellow men? Authority to judge, condemn, and give up others to Satan merely because they differ from you in judgment and opinion in religious matters, in one word, because <HI>they adopt not your creed?</HI>

Will you do all in your power to exclude a fellow servant the kingdom of Heaven, be∣cause his creed differs from yours, which is the very language of your late proceedings at <HI>Stafford?</HI> Will you continue to think you have this authority because when met you call you serves a <HI>Consociation,</HI> for in your in∣dividual capacity you pretend not to such au∣thority, when you have neither <HI>precept</HI> nor <HI>example</HI> of such a <HI>body</HI> of <HI>men</HI> in the <HI>Bible</HI> to keep yourselves in countenance; <HI>no char∣ter from Heaven</HI> incorporating you a <HI>Consoci∣ation,</HI> and <HI>vesting you</HI> with this <HI>authority</HI> in matters of faith? Your claim to such autho∣rity is no better founded than the <HI>Pope's claim</HI> to <HI>infallibility,</HI> and if you have it, you are <HI>schismaticks</HI> while you remain out of the <HI>bosom</HI> of the <HI>holy mother church,</HI> and ought directly repair to <HI>Rome</HI> As I am an Em∣bassador of Christ, though unworthy the ho∣nour and unequal to the service, I claim un∣disturbed liberty as s uch to search the scrip∣tures, judge and believe for myself; and to preach my own sentiments, my own intepre∣tations of scripture; I am not your Embassa∣dor; I received not my instructions from you, nor am I accountable to you, but to the <HI>supreme pastor;</HI> you may erect a petty tri∣bunal; you may usurp Christ's throne; as∣sume his prerogative; arraign a fellow ser∣vant; judge, condemn and excommunicate

<HEAD>AN ADDRESS TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>MY COUNTRYMEN AND FRIENDS,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE liberty we plead for, and have a right to expect, is not licentiousness, nor a liberty to laugh at and abuse a divine reve∣lation; but the principle of equal, impartial liberty to all peaceable members of the civil state, both preachers and hearers, to search and examine the sacred scriptures, and to believe, profess and preach those tenets and doctrines, which appear to them to be agreeable to the scriptures, and to reject, with entire and per∣fect impunity, any, or all those tenets and doc∣trines, by whomsoever they are received or taught, as do not appear to them to be agrea∣ble to the scriptures.</P>
<P>This notion of liberty was the very princi∣ple upon which the glorious Protestant refor∣mation from <HI>Popery</HI> began, proceeded and
<PB N="136" REF="016775_0135_0F9E2E66D3A5BD48"/>
was finally effected. This is the very princi∣ple of religious liberty, for which the Protest∣ant non-conformists, our illustrious ancestors in <HI>Great-Britain,</HI> contended unto blood, before and during the reigns of the Stuart family: For the enjoyment of this liberty they left their native country, crossed the Atlantic, and came into <HI>America:</HI> And this is the great and good principle upon which all <HI>New-England</HI> churches were first settled, and upon which they flourished for a great number of years. But alas! whither are we their children going! Surely with long and dismal strides we are returning again to <HI>Rome!</HI> For only take away liberty of free enquiry, and free profession, in matters of religion and the worship of the deity, and <HI>Protestantism</HI> is instantly given up and de∣stroyed, and <HI>popery</HI> inevitably introduced. And no longer than we hold the principle above, can we possibly defend the Protestant cause, no<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> ourselves in leaving the <HI>Romish</HI> communion. And will you, my country∣men, freely and without a struggle, give up that which is your very basis as Protest∣ants, your birth-right privilege as reasonable, accountable creatures, your divine ornament and glory as Christian professors! Will you become bound to believe as this or the other confession of faith directs, as this or the other ecclesiastick council shall decree, as this or
<PB N="137" REF="016775_0136_0F9E2E670EDF30A0"/>
the other minister teaches you, though in direct contradiction to the clear dictates of your consciences, regulated by the word of God! Will you resign your faith, your con∣sciences, and your religion into the hands of any man, or body of men, and delegate them to think, reason, judge and believe for you? Will you also appear before the tribu∣nal of Christ, the king of Zion, and your eternal judge, by your delegates too? And will they warrant your safe appearance there? If not, surely it is unsafe for you to betrust them now with your faith, your religion, and your consciences! I fancy I behold a mix∣ture of horror, indignation and contempt in your very countenances, upon reading these queries; to think that a bare motion should be made for you to resign every thing sacred and important to you on earth, and every thing dear and felicitating in a blessed im∣mortality! Your souls recoil at the naked thought of such horrid suicide, and so much ingratitude and impiety to the incarnate God, your saviour, who hath made you free! And perhaps you are almost offended with me for suggesting such thoughts to you. But reflect one minute on what you have read above. An ecclesiastick council, gravely met, upon the invitation, not of a pastor or church, but of three or four disaffected individuals, to <HI>judge of articles of faith and doctrines of
<PB N="138" REF="016775_0137_0F9E2E68174FD5A0"/>
religion;</HI> the accused pastor <HI>required</HI> to ap∣pear before them, and <HI>answer</HI> to <HI>charges of false and dangerous doctrines;</HI> and they final∣ly <HI>censuring, condemning,</HI> and then <HI>excommu∣nicating</HI> the pastor; though neither he nor his church ever embraced, but from the be∣ginning refused the constitution of <HI>Connecti∣cut</HI> churches, as it is to be learned from <HI>Say∣brook</HI> agreement! Herein you plainly see, and with your own eyes, the sacred liberty of conscience violated, the divine right of private judgment denied, protestantism overthrown, infallibility implicitly claimed, a wide door opened for the introduction of popery, and the prerogative of Christ, the only lawgiver in Zion, boldly assumed! Look again and again upon the doings of that council; con∣sider and weigh them well. Open your eyes, rouse up your attention, get yourselves quite awake; and do not suffer yourselves to be lulled to sleep by that vain and fallacious cry, <HI>the church is in danger,</HI> from false and corrupt doctrines entering into her. This has always been the cry of <HI>lazy, idle drones,</HI> who never will be at the pains of thinking out of the beaten tract, but receive their faith and religion, as they do their estates, from the last will and testament of those who went before them. Those that never did, and never will, bring any new thing out of their treasure, <HI>'as the good scribe always
<PB N="139" REF="016775_0138_0F9E2E6B643D4860"/>
does, who is instructed to the kingdom of Heaven,'</HI> we may depend will certainly find fault with those that do. And, when rea∣son and argument fail, such men will assume that armour which hath long been proved, and cry <HI>heresy, heresy, the church is in danger!</HI> and this always does the job with the igno∣rant and unwary? Before the <HI>Nicene</HI> coun∣cil, <HI>A. D.</HI> 325, this was the constant cry, <HI>heresy, heresy, the church is in danger!</HI> And to still this cry all the ecclesiastick councils, for 400 years were convened. But did these councils, which met for the same purposes with that at <HI>West-Stafford,</HI> really deliver the church from danger? Good God! never, never was the church so much endangered by all the combinations of earth and hell against her, as she was by the decrees of these ecclesiastick councils! Will you, after more than 1400 years sad and awful experi∣ence of the fatal consequences of the acts and doings of ecclesiastick councils in matters of faith and the worship of God, be still im∣posed upon by the cry of <HI>heresy, the church is in danger,</HI> &amp;c. "Now comes the <HI>fatal en∣gine,</HI>" says an author, "Ring the bells back∣ward! The temple, the temple of the Lord is on fire. The <HI>church</HI> is in danger! This cry of the church's being in danger, has been a religious <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>oa<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="2 letters" DISP="••"/>, under which the most wicked flagitious crimes have been perpetrat∣ed:

Witness all the histories of persecutions. The cry of <HI>heresy</HI> is more surprising to man∣kind, than the cry of fire; as the conse∣quences have generally been more terrible and awful."</P>
<P>Read with your own eyes the history of the church, and see and judge for yourselves what always have been, and thence learn what always will be the consequences of the acts and doings of ecclesiastick councils, when they have undertaken to censure and con∣demn religious tenets and doctrines, and to impose subscription.</P>
<P>Do you imagine that our catechisms, con∣fessions of faith, and present received forms, contain a complete and perfect system of re∣vealed religion? Are they absolutely incapa∣ble of addition, amendation or correction? Are they of divine original, and stamped with the authority of a God, and is he to be ac∣cursed who shall attempt to add to, or di∣minish from them. You doubtless believe our catechisms and confession of faith were made by poor, weak, fallible men; who had no authority, and indeed never claimed any, to impose their interpretations of scrip∣ture upon others; but lest every man at li∣berty to subscribe or not, according to the re∣suit of his own judgment. Why then should he be prosecuted in the <HI>spiritual court</HI> for <HI>heresy,</HI> who shall attempt to add to diminish
<PB N="141" REF="016775_0140_0F9E2E6DE7641758"/>
from, amend or correct these catechisms, confessions, &amp;c. and why should we pay the least attention to that old, trite, popish cry of <HI>heresy, your church, your constitution is in dan∣ger!</HI> One would think this too enlightened an age to be priest-ridden and deacon-ridden at such a rate! And it would be an unaccoun∣table phaenomenon to Europe, who have be∣held with astonishment the military skill, prowess, fortitude and resolution of the sons of America, in asserting and defending their civil rights and privileges against lawless power and domination, now to see them tamely crouching beneath the intolerable weight of ecclesiastic tyranny and despotism, and yielding implicit faith and submission to the arbitrary decrees of their priests and dea∣cons: Only advert to these obvious consider∣ations, that Christ Jesus is the only king in Zion;—that he hath left the consciences of men at entire and absolute liberty from all human restraints, so that we have perfect divine right to search the sacred Oracles for ourselves, to see with our own eyes, judge with our own understandings, not being ac∣countable to any intelligence in the universe, but him, for our religious tenets and senti∣ments: And that, <HI>that</HI> is a poor, sorry, wi∣thered, shabby faith in religion, absolutely un∣acceptable to Christ and unprofitable to our∣selves, that is dictated by, and sounded on, human authority<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/></P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="016775_0141_0F9E2E6E92060380"/>We ought constantly to endeavour to make progress in Christian knowledge, as well as all other excellent attainments; and never be content with what is already known, or was known 200 years ago. That excellent and generous speech of Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> to his congregation in <HI>Holland,</HI> just as a part of them were embarking for <HI>America,</HI> ought never to be forgotten by true protestants. Mr. <HI>Robinson</HI> kept a day of fasting and prayer with his church, and addressed them as fol∣lows, "Brethren, we are now quickly to part from one another, and whether I may ever live to see your faces on earth any more, the God of Heaven only knows; but whe∣ther the Lord has appointed that or no, I charge you before God and his blessed an∣gels, that you follow me no farther than you have seen me follow the Lord Jesus Christ. If God reveal any thing to you, by any other instrument of his, be as ready to receive it as ever you was to receive any truth by my ministry; for I am verily persuaded, the Lord has more truth yet to break forth out of his holy word. For my part, I can∣not sufficiently bewail the condition of the reformed churches, who are come to a period in religion, and will go at present no farther than the instruments of their reformation. The <HI>Lutherans</HI> cannot be drawn to go be∣yond what <HI>Luther</HI> saw; whatever part of
<PB N="143" REF="016775_0142_0F9E2E6F60040F68"/>
his will our God has revealed to <HI>Calvin,</HI> they will rather die than embrace it; and the <HI>Cal∣vinists,</HI> you see, stick fast where they were left by that great man of God, who yet saw not all things. This is a misery much to be lamented, for though they were burning and shining lights in their times, yet they pene∣trated not into the whole counsel of God, but were they now living, would be as wil∣ling to embrace farther light as that which they first received. I beseech you remem∣ber, it is an article of your church covenant, that <HI>you be ready to receive whatever truth shall be made known to you from the written word of God.</HI> Remember that, and every other article of your sacred covenant. But I must herewithal exhort you to take heed what you receive as truth, examine it, con∣sider it and compare it with other scriptures of truth, before you receive it; for it is not possible the christian world should come so lately out of such thick antichristian dark∣ness, and that perfection of knowledge should break forth at once." NEAL'S <HI>History of Puritans,</HI> vol. I. p. 490, 491.</P>
<P>A true protestant was this great and good man. How firmly did he believe the right all christians have to search the holy scrip∣tures, see and judge for themselves, and re∣ceive or reject whatever they shall judge to be agreeable or disagreeable thereto! How
<PB N="144" REF="016775_0143_0F9E2E70283165F0"/>
would his indignation have been kindled to have seen the proceedings of the late Con∣sociation at <HI>West-Stafford!</HI> and to have read their bold and arrogant result.</P>
<P>Let us endeavour to obtain the spirit of protestants, to assert and vindicate our liber∣ties as men, as reasonable accountable crea∣tures, and above all as christians; and, in spite of all the daring, haughty, assuming, popish claims of any man, or body of men, let us stand fast in that liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free.</P>

<HEAD><HI>POSTSCRIPT;</HI> Containing some Circumstances that attended the <HI>PROCEEDINGS</HI> of <HI>CONSOCIATION,</HI> at <HI>West-Stafford,</HI> November <HI>2, 1779.</HI></HEAD>
<P>NOVEMBER 2d, P. M. the venerable body proceeded to the house of public worship, and, after prayer, the complaint was read by one of the scribes of council, and likewise the defence of the four articles, &amp;c. Upon which the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bliss,</HI> a member of Consociation, arose, and began an impertinent harangue, which appeared evidently designed to mislead and impose upon the assembly, which was very nu∣merous. The accused pastor repeatedly a∣rose and requested liberty to read a paper he had in his hand, and obtained it finally with great difficulty, being told by several mem∣bers of Consociation that <HI>Mr. Bliss</HI> was Ad∣vocate for the aggrieved, and <HI>must</HI> not be <HI>in∣terrupted,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Bliss</HI> himself spake and said, "We did not come here, Mr. <HI>Foster,</HI> to hear you read papers, we came to judge." As the Consociation returned from the meeting-house to the council chamber, two of the members went into the house of the Rev. <HI>Isaac Foster,</HI> and then and there, of their own accord, said, that, at the desire of the
<PB N="146" REF="016775_0145_0F9E2E718CD56E50"/>
complainants, <HI>Mr. Bliss</HI> was <HI>voted Advocate</HI> for them by Consociation, and likewise that <HI>Consociation, for that reason, voted,</HI> that he <HI>should not</HI> be <HI>judge.</HI></P>
<P>On the 3d of November, when the Con∣sociation were in the meeting-house, and a large assembly of people collected, the Rev. Mr. <HI>Bliss,</HI> abovementioned, as was his con∣stant practice in that place, was inveighing with the utmost bitterness against the doc∣trines taught and received in the church at <HI>West-Stafford,</HI> as false, heretical, &amp;c. &amp;c. The oldest scribe of Consociation spake and said, "I do not know but it ought to be known by this congregation, that Mr. <HI>Bliss</HI> is chosen by this council—" Here Mr. <HI>Bliss</HI> broke in immediately, and in a lower tone said, "That is not to be told;" upon which the scribe ceased to speak further upon the matter. On the return of Consociation this day also, another and different member of their body called in at Mr. <HI>Foster</HI>'s and made the same declaration concerning Mr. <HI>Bliss,</HI> that the others made the day before.</P>

<SALUTE>To the Gentlemen members of the church who have signed the within paper, and others whom it may concern,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THIS may certify that the Rev. Mr. Bliss has not undertaken the office of advo∣cate for the complainants against the Rev. <HI>Isaac Foster,</HI> nor can with truth be consider∣ed so by any; true it is the complainants de∣sired of the council that Mr. Bliss might assist them in that character; the council gave liberty that he might, and some of the members of council thence mistakenly con∣cluded that he had undertaken; hence arose your mistake: But the truth is, he did en∣tirely decline the office, and accordingly has not been considered by the council in that character.</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>Attested by THEODORE HINSDALE, Scribe of the council.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>This may be affirmed without hesitation, that the Rev. Mr. Bliss acted the part of an advocate in public during the whole time of the residence of Consociation in <HI>West-Staf∣ford,</HI> and a most censorious, unchristian, and even inhuman part too; and what the peo∣ple complained of, or at least one thing they complained of, was, that Mr. Bliss should act
<PB N="149" REF="016775_0148_0F9E2E77F52F2490"/>
such a part, and appear in such a character in public, and yet deny, or at least refuse to own his advocacy for the complainants. If he was advocate they thought the public should have known it; if he was not, it appeared to them very astonishing, that a judge should be suffered to act such a part, publickly to pre∣judge the cause, and that in the most offen∣sive, virulent terms. The reply to their complaint informed them, that although it was desired by the complainants that Mr. Bliss might assist them in the character of advocate, and that he had liberty so to do from the council; yet he declined the office, and accordingly was not considered in that character by Consociation. But how does all this consist with the public and private voice of <HI>many members</HI> of <HI>their own body, the oldest scribe in particular,</HI> unitedly de∣claring that this Mr. Bliss was <HI>advocate for the aggrieved,</HI> that <HI>he was voted advocate by Consociation,</HI> &amp;c. &amp;c. all which can be sub∣stantially proved whenever there is need of it? Further, if Mr. Bliss declined the office, why did he then publickly execute the of∣fice? Why was he suffered to do so by Con∣sociation? And why was this given as a rea∣son, by several aged members of the coun∣cil, in particular by the oldest scribe, why Mr. Bliss must not be interrupted, viz. be∣cause he was advocate for the aggrieved?
<PB N="150" REF="016775_0149_0F9E2E78558E3040"/>
Mr. Bliss was either advocate, or judge, or both, or neither, if he was advocate, and we rather think he was, from the foregoing testimonies, and that this was what the old∣est scribe was proceeding to acquaint the as∣sembly with, when broke in upon by Mr. Bliss as related before; if this was the case, why all these contradictions? If he was judge, his public behaviour was insufferable upon any principles whatever. If he was both, it is a new thing under the sun, to make an attorney and judge of the same per∣son, and upon the same case. If the Conso∣ciation considered Mr. Bliss in no character, we are perfectly willing he should stand for a cypher: But perhaps all these seeming con∣tradictions may be perfectly reconciled by this one consideration, viz. that he was ap∣pointed <HI>advocate for the Lord Jesus Christ,</HI> as he declared himself to be in public; but if he did really act in this character, we think he ought to have executed the office, at least, with some degree of <HI>decency</HI> and <HI>de∣corum.</HI></P>
<P>Furthermore, on November 4th, when Consociation were in the meeting house, they promised the assembly that they should have timely notice when their result would be published. Nov. 5th a lecture preparato∣ry to the holy communion was preached 3 o'clock, P. M. After lecture several persons
<PB N="151" REF="016775_0150_0F9E2E7913E58950"/>
repaired to the place where Consociation sat, to enquire whether they were like to come to the meeting-house that day, and were told by some of the members of Consociation that they could not publish their result that night, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>or they had not accomplished their business; upon which the people went home: Soon after which it was resolved by Consociation, or at least by some of them, to repair to the meeting-house that evening, and read their result; and being told that the people were gone home, some of them replied, that is nothing to us, they might have staid if they would, we must not de∣lay our business for the people—according∣ly about sun-down they came to the meet∣ing-house, read their result, and then repair∣ed to their quarters.</P>
<P>All the above circumstances attending the proceedings of Consociation at <HI>West-Stafford</HI> appeared in public, and when occasion shall require, may be substantially authenticated by great numbers of eye and ear wit∣nesses.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> SINCE the late Consociation at <HI>West-Stafford</HI> undertook to justify their pro∣ceedure by quotations from Saybrook agree∣ment, it is meet some <HI>special</HI> remarks should be made upon these quotations. Among the articles for the administration of Church

discipline, Art. 3, is the first cited by Con∣sociation in the following words, "That all cases of scandal that shall fall out within the circuit of any of the aforesaid Consociations, shall be brought to a council of the elders and also messengers of the churches within said circuit." It will doubtless be observed by the reader that the Consociation was conven∣ed for the express purpose of <HI>judging upon doc∣trines said to be false and dangerous,</HI> &amp;c. and that they cited this article to prove they had a right to convene for this purpose. But perhaps Consociation meant to found their right upon the scriptures referred to in the article. The first scripture cited under the article, is 3. John ix 10. <HI>"I wrote unto the Church: But Diotrephes, who loveth to have pre-eminence among them, receiveth us not. Therefore if I come. I will remember his deeds which he doeth, prating against us with malicious words; and not content there∣with, neither doth he himself receive the bre∣thren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out of the church."</HI> Because St. <HI>John</HI> complained of some disingenuous and unfriendly conduct of one <HI>Diotrephes,</HI> there∣fore the North Consociation in <HI>Hartford</HI> county had a right to convene at West-Stafford, to judge upon false and dangerous doctrines! The next scripture cited in the article, is 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> xvi. <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>. <HI>"Now concern∣ing
<PB N="153" REF="016775_0152_0F9E2E7AB76D1E10"/>
the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the church of Galatia even so do ye."</HI> Because St. <HI>Paul</HI> desired the church at <HI>Co∣rinth</HI> to make a contribution for the poor brethren at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> therefore the Consoci∣ation had right to make creeds and confes∣sions of faith for the pastor of the church at <HI>West-Stafford!</HI> The next scripture is <HI>Gal.</HI> vi. 1, 2, <HI>"Brethren, if a man be overtaken in a fault, ye which are spiritual restore such an one in the spirit of meekness, considering thy∣self, lest thou also be tempted: Bear ye one a∣nother's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ"</HI> Because St. <HI>Paul</HI> exhorted the church at <HI>Galatia</HI> to treat an offending bro∣ther with humanity and tenderness, therefore the Consociation had a right to condemn and censure the pastor of the church at <HI>West-Stafford</HI> for preaching, as they judged, false and dangerous doctrines! And because St. <HI>Paul</HI> moved that the christians at <HI>Galatia</HI> should bear one another's burdens, therefore it was an act of kindness in the Consociation to make creeds and confessions for the pastor and church at <HI>West Stafford,</HI> and so to ease them of the burden of making them for themselves! The next scripture is, 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> xiii. 2. <HI>"I told you before, and foretell you as if I were present the second time; and being absent, now I write to them which heretofore have sinned, and to all other, that if I come a∣gain,
<PB N="154" REF="016775_0153_0F9E2E7EDA897CD0"/>
I will not spare."</HI> Because St. <HI>Paul</HI> gave repeated assurances to the church at <HI>Corinth,</HI> that, if he should chance that way again, he would administer proper reproof<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/> to any that had or should behave themselves unbecomingly; therefore the North Con∣sociation in <HI>Hartford</HI> county had a right to judge upon articles of doctrines, and to cen∣sure and excommunicate the pastor of the church at <HI>West-Stafford,</HI> for preaching such doctrines as they judged heterodox. The next scripture is <HI>Acts</HI> xv. 23. <HI>"And wrote letters by them after this manner, the apostles, elders and brethren, send greeting unto the brethren which are of the gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia."</HI> Because the apostles, elders and brethren, at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> sent let∣ters to the gentile churches in <HI>Antioch, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Celicia;</HI> telling them that they would do well to abstain from meats offered to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication, therefore the North Consociation in the county of <HI>Hartford</HI> had a right to con∣demn and excommunicate the pastor of the church at <HI>West-Stafford,</HI> if he would not ab∣stain from preaching such doctrines as they judged disagreeable to the gospel. The next is 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> viii. 23. <HI>"Whether any do enquire of</HI> Titus, <HI>he is my partner and fellow-helper concerning you: Or our brethren be en∣quired of, they are the messengers of the churches
<PB N="155" REF="016775_0154_0F9E2E8034CD6138"/>
and the glory of Christ."</HI> Because St. <HI>Paul</HI> thought it expedient that <HI>Titus</HI> and others, <HI>Luke</HI> and <HI>Apollos</HI> as is generally supposed, should be joined with him, to convey to the poor saints at <HI>Jerusalem,</HI> the contributions of the churches, and sent them to <HI>Antioch</HI> to spirit up the brethren there to make ready their contributions against he should come along, therefore the North Consociation in <HI>Hartford</HI> county had a right to go to <HI>West-Stafford</HI> to censure and condemn the pastor of the church there for preaching false doc∣trines! Hence every one sees that if the Consociation meant to found their right upon the scriptures cited under this article, that right was indisputably proved; for I know no better right than that founded on the bi∣ble!!—The other article cited by Consocia∣tion is the 5th, in these words, "That when any case is orderly brought before any coun∣cil of the churches, it shall there be heard and determined, which shall be a final issue, and all parties therein concerned, shall sit down, and be determined thereby." The reader will bear in mind, that the case brought before the venerable Consociation at <HI>West-Stafford</HI> was denied to be orderly before that body; and that they cite this article to prove that said case was cognizable, and finally to be determined by them. Now as the arti∣cle itself does not <HI>expressly</HI> say, that false and
<PB N="156" REF="016775_0155_0F9E2E81354AF5A8"/>
dangerous doctrines are a case that may be orderly brought before a Consociation, there∣fore, as in the other article, they doubtless meant that the scriptures here cited proved this. The first scripture is <HI>Acts</HI> xv. but as no verse in particular is quoted we cannot say any thing in reply. The next scripture is 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> v. 5. <HI>"To deliver such an one unto Sa∣tan for the destruction of the Flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus."</HI> Because St. <HI>Paul</HI> directed the church at <HI>Corinth</HI> to deliver to Satan the man who had been guilty of such gross fornication as to marry his father's wife, therefore the charge of preaching false and dangerous doctrines was orderly brought before the North Consociation in <HI>Hartford</HI> county, Nov. 2, 1779! The next scripture is 2 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 6.11. <HI>"Sufficient to such an one is the pu∣nishment which was inflicted of many—least Satan should get an advantage of us; for we are not ignorant of his devices."</HI> Because St. <HI>Paul</HI> now directs the church of <HI>Corinth</HI> to remove the censure they had passed upon the fornicator, since it had wrought for his good; left the devil should make a bad use of their want of humanity and tenderness, therefore the charge of false doctrines, &amp;c. was order∣ly brought before and finally to be issued by the North Consociation in <HI>Hartford</HI> county last fall, at <HI>West-Stafford!</HI> The next is <HI>Philip.</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="016775_0156_0F9E2E81818DF6E8"/>
iii. 15. <HI>"Let us therefore, as many as be per∣fect, be thus minded: And if in any thing ye be otherwise minded, God shall reveal even that unto you."</HI> Because St. Paul exhorted the christians at <HI>Philippi,</HI> who were sufficiently grounded in the first principles of christianity, to go on to perfection; and encouraged those who were not, that God would teach and instruct them; therefore the charge of false and dangerous doctrines lay scripturally before Consociation at <HI>West Stafford,</HI> and must be finally determined by them! The next scrip∣ture pertinent to the purpose, is <HI>Rom.</HI> xiv. 2, 3. <HI>"For one believeth that he may eat all things, another, who is weak, eateth herbs. Let not him that eateth despise him that eateth not, and let not him which eateth not, judge him that eateth; for God hath received him."</HI> Because St. Paul would have christians act according to their own inc<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>inations in eating meat or herbs, or any thing else, without censuring one another for different notions about these things; therefore, it is beyond all dispute, the case of false doctrines was very orderly and scripturally before Consociation at West-Stafford, Nov. 2, 1779; and that they had authority finally to decide it, without any privilege of appeal, or benefit of clergy.</P>
<P>As these two articles are as clearly found∣ed on scripture as any other, that would have served the purpose of Consociation; and as
<PB N="158" REF="016775_0157_0F9E2E8253260210"/>
every one sees at first view, that these scrip∣tures have not even the most distant reference to the business of Consociation at West-Stafford last fall; we are persuaded the render will judge very favourably of the opposition that was made to the proceedings of that body, and also of the propriety of adopting the holy scriptures, and not platforms of hu∣man composure, as a rule of faith and prac∣tice.</P>

<HEAD>APPENDIX; Containing a RENUNCIATION of SAYBROOK PLATFORM, (usually so called) with the Reasons of it.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><SALUTE><HI>To the</HI> GENTLEMEN <HI>of the</HI> CONSOCIATION <HI>now convened in this place:</HI></SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I BEG leave to make the following repre∣sentation, viz When I was ordained in the ministry at <HI>Windsor,</HI> I objected against adopting Saybrook Platform as a model of church-discipline. But never did I dream of such an interpretation of that book, as should warrant any <HI>ecclesiastick council</HI> in judging upon articles of <HI>faith,</HI> for any preacher, pro∣fessor, or church of christians on earth, until the affair of Mr. Sage at West-Simsbury. And I doubt not it will be easily recollected by a number of gentlemen of the Consocia∣tion who were <HI>then</HI> present, that I then made very great opposition to any decision of Con∣sociation in Mr. Sage's disfavour, on account of his <HI>doctrines</HI> or <HI>articles</HI> of <HI>faith;</HI> not be∣cause I was of his opinion in every article, but because I considered Consociation as hav∣ing no authority to judge upon <HI>articles</HI> of <HI>faith,</HI>
<PB N="160" REF="016775_0159_0F9E2E839B2B8160"/>
to his disadvantage, or the disadvantage of any man, or body of men, on earth, either from Platform or the word of God. Gen∣tlemen, I am conscientiuosly of the same mind still. And from the recent experience I have had of what I imagine to be a mis∣interpretation of Saybrook Platform, I take this opportunity to signify my absolute re∣nunciation of that book, as the <HI>rule</HI> of my <HI>faith</HI> or <HI>manners,</HI> so far as it can possibly be interpreted to signify a right in any man, or body of men on earth, to judge upon <HI>articles</HI> of <HI>Faith,</HI> not <HI>heretical,</HI> to the least disadvan∣tage of any preacher, professor, or church of Christ on earth. And also so far as said book gives <HI>authority</HI> to any ecclesiastick council, of whatever name, to <HI>decide</HI> and <HI>fi∣nally determine</HI> any cause whatsoever, so that all parties shall be obliged to sit down con∣tented. If a matter of difficulty ariseth in any church, or between any pastor and church, I doubt not of the <HI>expediency</HI> of ask∣ing counsel and advice of neighbouring pastors and churches; and, in this case, an ecclesi∣astick council have right to give their opini∣on, counsel and advice; but no <HI>authority,</HI> in my opinion, to enforce any <HI>judgment or deci∣sion</HI> of theirs upon, pastor or church. If the pastor and church, or whatever parties con∣cerned, do mutually agree to abide the result of council; the council have, in this case, the
<PB N="161" REF="016775_0160_0F9E2E844D5C0370"/>
same right to give their opinion, &amp;c. as though no such agreement had taken place; and this opinion of theirs is now become de∣cisive; not on account or any <HI>authority</HI> in the council to make it so, but because of the mutual agreement of the <HI>parties concerned,</HI> that it shall be so.</P>
<P>My church and people, so far as I am acquainted, are perfectly of my mind, as a∣bove expressed, with regard to the authority of ecclesiastick councils, both as to articles of faith and doctrines of religion, and all other matters cognizable by such councils.</P>

<DATELINE><HI>Stafford,</HI> <DATE><HI>Nov.</HI> 5, 1779.</DATE></DATELINE></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>The reasons of the above RENUNCIA∣TION follow.</P>
<P>CHRIST Jesus hath given each individu∣al in his church, a right to <HI>judge</HI> for them∣selves, as to the interpretation of the holy scriptures, and to receive as articles of their faith, or reject whatever <HI>they</HI> shall <HI>judge</HI> a∣greeable or repugnant to the Bible. For proof, <HI>Mat.</HI> xx. 25, 26. xxiii. 8, 9. <HI>But he ye not called Rabbi: For one is your master, even Christ; and all ye are brethren. And call no man your father, upon the earth; for
<PB N="162" REF="016775_0161_0F9E2E857A37AFC0"/>
one is your father, which is in Heaven. Mark</HI> x. 42, 43, 44. <HI>John</HI> v. 39. <HI>Search the scriptures; for in them ye think ye have eternal life. And they are they that testify of me. Acts</HI> xvii. 11, 12. <HI>These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they searched the scriptures daily, whether these things were so. Therefore many of them be∣lieved, &amp;c. Rom</HI> xiv. 1—12. 1 <HI>Cor.</HI> ii. 5. <HI>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. Gal.</HI> i. 6—10. 1 <HI>Pet.</HI> v. 3. <HI>Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being ensamples to the Flock.</HI> 1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 1. <HI>Beloved, believe not every spirit; but try the spirits, whether they be of God; because many false prophets are gone out into the world.</HI></P>
<P>It is agreeable to the mind of Christ that every professor of his religion, whether preacher or hearer, should exercise this <HI>di∣vine right.</HI> For it cannot be supposed that Christ should give Christians a right he would not be willing they should use.</P>
<P>It is also agreeable to the mind of Christ, that christians, whilst they conscientiously exercise this <HI>sacred right of private judgment,</HI> should be <HI>unmolested</HI> and <HI>undisturbed, and not subject to any disadvantages</HI> whatsoever, on account of any <HI>differing opinions or sentiments in re∣ligion,</HI> which may possibly result from the exercise of this <HI>common right.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="163" REF="016775_0162_0F9E2E8631379048"/>Therefore no man, or body of men, act according to the mind of Christ, when they give the least molestation or disturbance to any christians, whether preachers or hearers; or subject them to the least disadvantage, on account of any of their different interpretati∣ons of sacred scriptures, opinions or sentiments whatsoever.</P>
<P>If these two last propositions were not true, then christians might, according to the mind of Christ, be subjected to molestation and disturbance, and to many and great disadvan∣tages, even whilst they were acting conscien∣tiously according to the mind of Christ; ex∣ercising a right which he had given them; and indeed <HI>for this very conduct</HI> of theirs! which never will be admitted by any friend to <HI>revealed religion.</HI></P>
<P>To withdraw christian communion and fellowship from any christian preacher or professor, or from any church of Christ, on account of differing opinions or sentiments in religion, is to subject that preacher, professor, or church of Christ, from whom christian communion and fellowship is withdrawn, to many and great disadvantages; it is to de∣prive them of all those advantages, whatever they may be, which result from christian communion and fellowship. Therefore the undeniable and unavoidable inference from the whole argument is this, That it is not
<PB N="164" REF="016775_0163_0F9E2E891BEE5848"/>
agreeable to the mind of Christ, that any man, or body of men on earth, or any eccle∣siastick council, of whatever name or <HI>boasted authority,</HI> should withdraw christian com∣munion and fellowship from any christian preacher, professor or church, on account of differing opinions and sentiments in religion.</P>
<P>Again, as the Bible is the christian's <HI>only rule of faith,</HI> and as all christians have the <HI>sacred right</HI> above spoken of; no individual christian, whether preacher or hearer, has a right to impose subscription to any proposition of religion, not <HI>expressly</HI> contained in the Bi∣ble, on any other individual christian, whe∣ther preacher or hearer: For as far as any such right of imposition takes place, so far the right of private judgment is destroyed. A right in <HI>A</HI> to <HI>judge</HI> for himself, and to re∣ceive or reject any proposition in religion, not <HI>expressed</HI> in the Bible, according to the result of his own judgment; and a right in B to im∣pose subscription to any proposition, or any number of propositions in religion, not ex∣pressly contained in the Bible, on A, cannot possibly consist together. A's right is clear∣ly and undeniably proved above, and indeed is indisputable among all true protestants; B, therefore, undoubtedly has no such right of imposition. But if B has no right of imposi∣tion on A, then he has no right to deprive A of any privilege or advantage whatsoever,
<PB N="165" REF="016775_0164_0F9E2E8A77DBBA78"/>
because he differs from him, though ever so much, in his belief of any propositions not expressed in the Bible. If B therefore with∣draws communion from A, because A's creed is not the same with B's, he does what is absolutely wrong and injurious; he assumes to himself a right to judge for A, and in so doing denies A's right to judge for himself, contrary to what is generally acknowledged, and hath been demonstrated above. But if B has no such right of imposition and depri∣vation, &amp;c. as above, then B, C, D, E, F and G, when met together in council, have no right of imposition on A, or to deprive him of any the least privilege or advantage what∣soever, because he differs from them in re∣ligious sentiments, and will not renounce his own and subscribe their creed, or any human creed that can be named, that is not composed in the express words of holy scrip∣tures, For the whole right of B, C, D, &amp;c. when met in council, is certainly made up of the <HI>sum total</HI> of their individual rights. B has no more right in council, than he had in his single capacity; in which single capacity he hath just been proved to have none at all. But B has as much right as C, or D, or any other member of the council; which is none at all. When met together therefore in council, though it should be with all <HI>conceiv∣able gravity and solemnity,</HI> and the greatest
<PB N="166" REF="016775_0165_0F9E2E8B729FCB08"/>
<HI>parade</HI> and air of <HI>clerical authority,</HI> they have no right to impose on A, require him to renounce his <HI>own,</HI> or subscribe <HI>their</HI> creed; or to deprive him of any privilege whatsoever, because he differs from them in the articles of his faith, and will not renounce them and come over to their side, but insists upon en∣joying and using that liberty wherewith Christ hath made him free. For when met in council, the rights of B, C, D, E, F and G, are brought into one sum, <HI>and six times nothing is nothing!</HI> and this is the <HI>sum total</HI> of the council's right: For ever so ma∣ny cyphers will not amount to a sum. A very limited <HI>authority.</HI></P>
<P>Again, let us view this withdrawing com∣munion in a point of light a little different from the foregoing. B insists upon with∣drawing communion from A, because A preaches or professes false and dangerous doctrines. A declares what he preaches or professes, to be the sincere dictates of his judgment, regulated by reason and the Bible. B declares the same as to his doc∣trines and articles of faith. Both A and B have collected their tenets from the same sources, reason and the Bible; and in the ex∣ercise of the same <HI>right</HI> of private judgment. A is perfectly willing B should enjoy all the liberty <HI>he</HI> does; and is not disposed to give him the least disturbance or molestation
<PB N="167" REF="016775_0166_0F9E2E8BCD7EBA28"/>
imaginable; but really desirous he should en∣joy all the privileges of christian society. A is willing to subscribe the bible as his <HI>only rule of faith;</HI> nor does he preach or hold any one proposition contrary or repugnant to any <HI>ex∣press</HI> proposition of the bible. The whole difference between A and B lies in their dif∣ferent interpretations of the holy scriptures. But after all their mutual pains and labour to accommodate differences of sentiment, they are each of the same opinion as before. A still retains however his tolerant disposition to∣wards B, and is as willing now as ever that he should enjoy his own opinions in un∣disturbed quiet. <HI>B</HI> is dissatisfied and will not exercise charity and toleration with respect to <HI>A,</HI> but insists upon withdrawing communion from him, and depriving him of the privi∣leges of christian society and fellowship.</P>
<P>The question now is, whether <HI>B</HI> does not treat <HI>A</HI> injuriously and deny him the right of private judgment? I am inclined to take the affirmative of this question, which may be clearly demonstrated thus; <HI>B</HI> can have no right to withdraw christian communion and fellowship from <HI>A,</HI> but on supposition of <HI>A</HI>'s having acted wrongs and contrary to the clear dictates or Christ's religion; and if <HI>B</HI> has no right to withdraw communion from <HI>A,</HI> then in doing it he hath treated him injuriously, and denied him the right of private judg∣ment.
<PB N="168" REF="016775_0167_0F9E2E8C8F945F70"/>
These things will be conceeded by everyone. Now <HI>A</HI>'s wrong and antichristian conduct hath been this, that he hath careful∣ly and impartially searched the holy scrip∣tures, and consequently embraced certain te∣nets and sentiments in religion, d<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ffering in∣deed from those of <HI>B,</HI> but such as he consci∣entiously believes to be consistent with the Bible. If <HI>A</HI> hath acted wrong and contrary to the clear dictates of Christ's religion in so doing, then it is certainly wrong and contrary to the clear dictates of Christ's religion, that <HI>A</HI> should search and examine the bible, and form his own religions creed according to the result of his own judgment: and if so, A hath no right of private judgment; which was one thing to be proved. <HI>B</HI> hath then certainly denied A's right of private judg∣ment; which he had no right to do: and therefore he hath treated <HI>A</HI> injuriously; which was the other thing to be proved. So that <HI>B</HI> cannot withdraw communion from A, on account of A's religious sentiments, as being ever so different from his own, with∣out treating him injuriously, and denying him the right of private judgment.</P>
<P>Here <HI>B</HI> may perhaps say, I do not mean to deny A's right of private judgment: I only claim the same right to judge for my∣self, which I willingly allow A to enjoy; <HI>i. e.</HI> a right to judge whether I may, or may
<PB N="169" REF="016775_0168_0F9E2E8DA1C975B8"/>
not consistently hold communion with <HI>A.</HI> I pretend not to judge for <HI>A,</HI> or to deny the right he hath to judge for himself; as to all the articles of his faith.</P>
<P>I know this is <HI>B</HI>'s only subterfuge: But it is a mean, sorry shift, make the best of it!</P>
<P>The fallacy of this observation of <HI>B,</HI> is pal∣pable. It is apparently fallacious, from what hath been said above. I intreat <HI>B</HI> to advert to this one consideration, viz If he has no right to withdraw communion from <HI>A,</HI> on account of any differing sentiments in reli∣gious matters, he certainly has no right to judge he has. For no man has a right to judge wrong, Besides, <HI>B</HI> takes the thing to be proved for granted, <HI>i. e.</HI> that he may with∣draw communion from <HI>A</HI> on account of differing sentiments in religion. That he may not, I have endeavoured to demonstrate above. But further yet, we may easily per∣ceive the absurdity of any such right in <HI>B,</HI> if we only consider that <HI>B</HI> has no right to with∣draw communion from <HI>A,</HI> that <HI>A</HI> hath not to withdraw communion from <HI>B,</HI> on account of differing sentiments in religion: For un∣doubtedly <HI>B</HI> differs as much from <HI>A,</HI> as <HI>A</HI> doth from <HI>B,</HI> in his religious creed. So that <HI>A</HI> and <HI>B</HI> have equal right to excommu∣nicate, on account of difference of sentiment.</P>
<P>But what shocking absurdity is here! and what notorious impeachment of the wisdom
<PB N="170" REF="016775_0169_0F9E2E8E15F765D8"/>
and goodness of Jesus Christ the head of the church! Must the blessed Jesus, that most warm and sincere friend of mankind, who, influenced by his unparallelled love to the church, gave his own life a sacrifice for her! Must <HI>he,</HI> who is the wisdom as well as power of God, be supposed to have left things in such state in his church, that two christians, or two churches, should in their turns, ex∣communicate and be excommunicated by each other, and alternately denied the privi∣leges of christian society and fellowship! and this too for their fidelity and firm attachment to <HI>him</HI> as their <HI>Lord and master,</HI> and their con∣scientious adherence to those rights which <HI>he himself</HI> hath been pleased to grant them! Far be it! God forbid any such bold and impious impeachment of the wisdom and goodness of our divine redeemer.</P>
<P>This and other consequences, however shocking and blasphemous they may appear, cannot possibly be avoided, upon the suppo∣sition that one church, or one christian, hath a right to withdraw communion from another church, or christian, on account of differing sentiments in religion.</P>
<P>Indeed the idea of withdrawing commu∣nion on account of different sentiments in re∣ligion, is abhorrent from reason and com∣mon sense, as well as from the bible; and contrary to the principles of the reformation
<PB N="171" REF="016775_0170_0F9E2E9138E47FB8"/>
from popery: And those who withdraw communion on account of difference in reli∣gious sentiments, cannot possibly justify the reformation from popery, in any consistence with their conduct. Withdrawing commu∣nion, in <HI>America,</HI> signifies the same thing with dragooning, beheading, or burning in popish countries; is practised upon the same principles, and to be justified by the same reasons: And the genius of the civil govern∣ment of this country, is the only thing which prevents those who withdraw commu∣nion from others, on account of differing sen∣timents in religion, from imprisoning, con∣demning, depriving and burning them.</P>
<P>An <HI>heretick</HI> is indeed to be rejected; but not on account of any sentiments in religion which he holds, as differing from those of other men; but because he breaks off from the communion of a christian church, that will not subscribe certain tenets he hath form∣ed, as the rule of her faith; which tenets and opinions are not <HI>expressed</HI> in her adopted rule of faith, the bible. Except the <HI>heretick</HI> and immoral christian, there is no character that is to be denied christian communion and fellowship, according to any laws of Christ I ever saw.</P>
<P>If a man subscribes and adopts the scrip∣tures of the Old and New Testament as his <HI>only</HI> rule of faith and practice—if he, to all

appearance, fears God and works righteous∣ness—is a peaceable and quiet member of the family, the church and the state, though he adopts sentiments and opinions in religion ever so different from those of some other man, some church, or many churches, from some ecclesiastick council, or from all ec∣clesiastick councils that ever have been, or ever will be, so long as time endures, if these tenets and opinions are not contrary to <HI>clear, indubitable, express scripture,</HI> no man, no church, no ecclesiastick council have any right, in my humble opinion, to withdraw communion from that man, or to subject him to the least conceivable inconvenience or dis∣advantage, on account of these differing te∣nets and opinions. Nor can any thing of this kind be done, by men uninspired, without great injury and cruel injustice to the man, and a palpable denial of the right of private judgment in matters of religion; without daring and presumtuous boldness, pride and arrogance, and the most shocking imputations upon the wisdom and goodness of the wisest and most beneficent personage in the uni∣verse!</P>
<P>That adopting the bible and subscribing the holy scriptures as the <HI>only</HI> rule of faith and practice is sufficient, and all that ought ever to be required of any man, whether preacher or professor, in order to christian
<PB N="173" REF="016775_0172_0F9E2E93F671FD00"/>
fellowship and communion, is evident from the scriptures themselves. 1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 1, 2, 3. <HI>Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of God: because ma∣ny false prophets are gone out into the world. Hereby know ye the spirit of God: every spi∣rit that confesseth that Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is of God: and every spirit that con∣fesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the Flesh, is not of God.</HI> Here the apostle is giv∣ing directions to a christian church, how they ought to treat those who pretended to be preachers of religion. And he tells the church how they might come to a safe and happy decision with reference to their recep∣tion and treatment of such pretenders, viz. by bringing them to a sure point of trial and religious test; whether they did, or did not, confess that Jesus Christ was come in the flesh. If they confessed this they were to be received, if not, rejected. For to confess that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is, in effect, to confess that the scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the word of God. For, if Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, these scriptures are certainly the word of God: And, if these scriptures are the word of God, then certainly Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. So that to confess either, is, in effect, the same thing. And to confess this, was, in St. <HI>John</HI>'s day, sufficient to christian fellowship and
<PB N="174" REF="016775_0173_0F9E2E9419574E00"/>
communion. The world was not so wise and sagacious then as it hath been since. It hath often been the case, since St. <HI>John</HI>'s day, that men could not be heard as prophets, nor received to christian communion and fellow∣ship, upon their confession that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, or subscription to the Old and New Testament as their <HI>only rule of faith.</HI> But in order to be qualified for the pulpit or communion table, men have been, and still are, obliged to subscribe long lists of articles of faith, and certain creeds and con∣fessionals, catechisms, &amp;c. And by these means men become <HI>sound and orthodox di∣vines, staunch Calvinists;</HI> and, I may add, <HI>ar∣rant fools!</HI> But I desire to thank God, I was never dubbed a Calvinist, or orthodox in this way! and I would be thankful for that <HI>re∣straining grace,</HI> that hath ever withheld my hand from subscribing any <HI>creed, confession of faith, or catechism,</HI> or any thing else of <HI>hu∣man composition, as the rule of my faith or manners!</HI></P>
<P>It is indeed surprising men should have the presumption and effrontery to demand any thing but subscription to the bible, as a necessary prerequisite to preaching the gospel, or communing at the table of our Lord. Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s observation upon this business of subscription to human creeds, &amp;c. is worthy of special notice in this place. Says he,
<PB N="175" REF="016775_0174_0F9E2E94CCD483F0"/>
"For when they have determined the holy scriptures to be the only foundation of faith, they nevertheless lay down certain propositi∣ons as fundamental, which are not in the scriptures; and because others will not ac∣knowledge those additional opinions of theirs, nor build upon them as if they were necessa∣ry and fundamental, they therefore make a separation in the church, either by withdraw∣ing themselves from the others, or expelling the others from them. Nor does it signify any thing for them to say that their confes∣sions and symbols are agreeable to scripture, and to the analogy of faith. For if they be conceived in the express words of scripture, there can be no question about them; be∣cause those are acknowledged by all christi∣ans to be of divine inspiration, and therefore fundamental. But if they say, that the arti∣cles which they require to be professed, are consequences deduced from the scripture, it is undoubtedly well done of them to be∣lieve and profess such things as seem unto them so agreeable to the rule of faith; but it would be very ill done to obtrude those things upon others, to whom they do not seem to be the indubitable doctrines of the scripture. For I do not think there is any man arrived to that degree of madness, as that he dare give out his consequences and interpretations of scripture as divine inspirati∣ons,
<PB N="176" REF="016775_0175_0F9E2E959C785098"/>
and compare the articles of faith he has framed according to his own fancy with the authority of the scripture. I know there are some propositions so evidently agreeable to scripture, that no body can deny them to be drawn from thence; but about those there∣fore there can be no difference. This only I say, that however clearly we may think this or the other doctrine to be deduced from scripture, we ought not therefore to impose it upon others, as a necessary article of faith, because we believe it to be agreeable to the rule of faith; unless we would be content also that other doctrines should be imposed upon us in like manner; and that we should be compelled to receive all the different and contradictory opinions of <HI>Lutherans, Calvin∣ists, Remonstrants, Anabaptists,</HI> other sects, which the contrivers of symboles, systems and confessions are accustomed to deliver to their followers as genuine and necessary de∣ductions from the holy scripture.</P>
<P>"I cannot but wonder at the extravagant arrogance of those men who think that they themselves can explain things necessary to sal∣vation more clearly than the <HI>holy ghost,</HI> the infinite and eternal wisdom of God." Thus far Mr. <HI>Locke</HI>'s Letter concerning toleration, p. 75, 76. I am willing to profess myself of the same mind with this great and good man now quoted, as to this unreasonable
<PB N="177" REF="016775_0176_0F9E2E9659B102D8"/>
and odious business of making and subscrib∣ing human creeds and confessions.</P>
<P>The Dissenting Gentleman, says, p. 307, 308, "The <HI>holy scriptures</HI> your Lordship, and all protestant divines, acknowledge to be a <HI>perfect rule of faith:</HI> In them all needful and important doctrines are <HI>so plainly</HI> reveal∣ed, in <HI>words</HI> dictated by the <HI>holy ghost,</HI> that no <HI>sincere</HI> person can possibly mistake con∣cerning them, so as dangerously to err. Sub∣scription, therefore, to these scriptures, is all that the interest of <HI>truth</HI> and of <HI>religion</HI> does require. Now, should any man upon earth, or any body of men, take upon them to draw up articles or formulas of faith, in words <HI>different</HI> from the holy scriptures, and to propose them as a <HI>rule of faith,</HI> or a <HI>test of truth</HI> to others; what, my Lord, is the real nature, or the proper language of such an action? Is it not plainly this; that he thinks himself able to define the doctrines of <HI>revelation</HI> in apter and more proper terms than those of the <HI>holy ghost?</HI> Does he not in effect say, that the great truths of religion, as they stand revealed in the scriptures (in words which not <HI>man's wisdom,</HI> but which the wisdom of God dictated) are not so di∣stinctly and clearly expressed as <HI>man's wis∣dom,</HI> (yea, as his own wisdom) is able to ex∣press them? And is not this, my Lord, pre∣sumtuously to set himself up as a <HI>corrector</HI> of
<PB N="178" REF="016775_0177_0F9E2E97295DEB88"/>
the holy ghost? To declare himself capable of <HI>mending</HI> the revelation! and to profess himself <HI>authorised</HI> to dictate to the faith of others, and to interpret the scriptures for them!"</P>
<P>I frankly confess I see not why the re∣quiring subscription to any <HI>articles of faith,</HI> framed by men, and not conceived in the words of scripture, as a necessary prerequisite of christian or ministerial communion and fellowship, is not an high, implicit impeach∣ment both of the wisdom and goodness of God. The holy ghost hath certainly ex∣plained the articles of christian faith, so far as he thought necessary for all the purposes of christian society in this world, and eternal happiness in the world to come. Both the goodness and wisdom of God would prompt him to do this: Yea, he hath expressly told us he hath done it, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI> iii. 16, 17. Now for men to frame certain tenets and propositi∣ons in religion, according to their own fancy, not conceiving them in any expressions of holy scriptures, and impose them on others, <HI>as articles of faith,</HI> and require subscription to them, as necessary to christian communion and fellowship in this world, or happiness in the next; is certainly to do and require more, in order to christian communion in this world, and happiness in the next, than the wisdom and goodness of God have ever
<PB N="179" REF="016775_0178_0F9E2E97CAAFA050"/>
moved him to do and require for these pur∣poses. Either what is done in this business of creed-making and subscription by men, is not at all necessary for christian communion here, or happiness hereafter; or else the wis∣dom and goodness of God have not done all that is necessary for these purposes in the sacred scriptures. If what men have done, and yet continue to do in this business of creeds and subscriptions, be unnecessary for the purposes mentioned above; then, why are creeds composed, and subscription to them required? If this business of creed-making and subscription be necessary; why hath not the wisdom of God discerned this necessity? And why hath not his goodness excited him to provide some effectual remedy against the wretched consequences of leaving this business of creed-making to men? For I make no doubt God hath a sufficient capacity to frame a creed that would be less exceptionable and more generally subscribed by christians, and with far greater satisfaction, than any creed that hath ever been composed by men's hands. And I imagine such a divine creed, written with the finger of God, though it should be <HI>imposed,</HI> and subscription to it re∣quired, would not occasion such general un∣easiness among christians, nor be attended with so much complaint and cry of <HI>religious tyranny,</HI> nor be followed with such detesta∣ble
<PB N="180" REF="016775_0179_0F9E2E9B6C3AE428"/>
and pernicious consequences, as have al∣ways taken place upon the imposition of all human creeds without exception.</P>
<P>God himself testified, in an awful manner, his high displeasure at the imposition of the first human creed; that made and imposed by the <HI>Nicene council,</HI> A. D. 325. And it cannot be shewn from ecclesiastick history that one good consequence ever follow∣ed the imposition of a creed made by men, and not conceived in the expressions of holy scriptures.</P>
<P>But though it be thus demonstrably con∣trary to reason and common sense, contrary to the scriptures, and an high blasphemous impeachment of the wisdom and goodness of God, that men should make and impose creeds, confessions of faith, catechisms, &amp;c. yet creed-mongers will have something to plead in favour of this business of creed-making: And I expect nothing more, than that, in consequence of my attempts to set at naught this craft, I shall hear a mighty cry, similar, it may be, to that St. <HI>Paul</HI> heard at <HI>Athens,</HI> occasioned by his setting at naught the craft of the silversmiths, who made sh<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ines for <HI>Diana.</HI> I fancy the business of creed making is not quite so gainful, especi∣ally in protestant countries, as was the craft of making shrines for <HI>Diana;</HI> yet as it is so sweet and gratifying to men of haughty,
<PB N="181" REF="016775_0180_0F9E2E9D6E397730"/>
proud, assuming, arrogant spirits, to be dicta∣tors of other men's creeds and confessions; such men may be as much incensed when this business is spoken against, as were the silversmiths of old, when <HI>Diana</HI> was spoken against.</P>
<P>But what will the sticklers for human creeds and confessions say? They will un∣doubtedly object that, if men subscribe only the holy scriptures, then preachers, professors and churches may presently grow corrupt, pervert the scriptures to patronize their errors, degenerate from the faith, &amp;c. &amp;c. Just as if the same men who would corrupt the word of God, would not also corrupt a creed or confession made by men! The Dis∣senting Gentleman says on this matter, "Will it be said—But crafty and corrupt men pervert the words of the <HI>holy ghost,</HI> and sk<GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="pdcc" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>een dangerous errors under scriptural forms. Let it be said: And will not crafty and corrupt men as easily pervert, and as lightly violate and break through all the ar∣ticles and forms which <HI>human skill</HI> can de∣vise, or <HI>human prudence</HI> prescribe? Does not the plainest reason and nature of the thing speak, that thus it will be? Has not the experience of <HI>fourteen hundred</HI> years put it beyond all doubt? Will any articles or forms of doctrine prove a fence against a man of an insincere and corrupt heart, or
<PB N="182" REF="016775_0181_0F9E2E9E529E0590"/>
keep him out of the church? No: He will ever swim with the stream; he will declare or subscribe any thing, as his worldly interest directs. No, my Lord, it is men of <HI>virtue</HI> and <HI>integrity</HI> only, your Lordship well knows, that can possibly be affected here: It is men of <HI>principle</HI> and <HI>conscience</HI> only, that these subscriptions are ever capable of keeping out of the church: So that, if rightly considered, it is not in their nature to be the least guard against error, nor the least secu∣rity to truth. And when withal it is re∣membered, how in all ages of the church they have been most mischievously employ∣ed by the several parties of <HI>christians,</HI> as they alternately prevailed! What wrecks they have made of conscience! What sacrifices of integrity to human ignorance and pride! What engines they have proved in the hands of the rulers of the darkness of this world, to torture and oppress good men, and to exalt and aggrandize the bad!—Scarce any thing can be more amazing, than that a mea∣sure so notoriously preposterous and absurd; a measure so directly tending to bring <HI>cor∣ruption</HI> into the church, and to keep integri∣ty and conscience out; should ever have been patronized, and even vehemently urged, by men, unquestionably both wise and good." p. 308, 309.</P>
<P>A little attention to ecclesiastick history
<PB N="183" REF="016775_0182_0F9E2E9EC51DF790"/>
will convince any impartial enquirer after truth, that all the endeavours that ever have been made, either by individuals or by coun∣cils and synods, to effect a <HI>uniformity of opi∣nion and sentiment in religious matters,</HI> in the church of Christ, have been, not only vain and fruitless, but attended with the most baneful and pernicious consequences. Where it can be shewn that a single error hath ever been suppressed by framing and imposing creeds and confessions of faith, it may easily be shewn, that an hundred have received their rise and propagation <HI>by these very means.</HI> And as it constantly and invariably hath been the case in the church, that hatred, va∣riance, wrath, strife, seditions, emulations and heresies have followed the endeavours of of creed mongers and confession-makers, to bring about a <HI>uniformity in religious opinions and sentiments</HI> in the christian church, so we have all the reason in the world to believe, that these sad and dismal consequences will ever follow such endeavours. Men do not look alike, nor speak, nor write alike: And just as vain and sleeveless a business would it be, in my opinion, for any man, or body of men, to undertake to effect a <HI>uniformity of visages, manner of speaking, and hand-writing</HI> amongst mankind, as to effect a <HI>uniformity in religious tenets and sentiment.</HI> And who∣ever can effect the former, may perhaps ef∣fect
<PB N="184" REF="016775_0183_0F9E2E9F4BA673D0"/>
the latter. Why then such a mighty cry about <HI>orthodoxy</HI> in religion? We never hear of an <HI>orthodox</HI> face, an <HI>orthodox</HI> manner of speaking or writing amongst mankind. "It is great pity," says the author of Remarks upon President Clap's History, &amp;c. "as cha∣rity is our distinguishing mark as christians, that we exercise it much less in religion, than in the common affairs of life. Agreeable to which, says an author, I do not believe that there are two men upon earth who think exactly alike upon every subject; and yet our differ∣ent tastes in meat, drink, building and dress make not the least difference in human so∣ciety; nor is it likely that they ever will, un∣less we establish by law, and tack preferments to one particular mode of eating, drinking, building and dressing; then indeed we may expect to see the established orthodox <HI>mason, cook</HI> and <HI>taylor,</HI> very zealous and loud for conformity and penalties: But at present ten men, in ten different suits, can dine together upon ten different dishes; and give ten dif∣ferent opinions upon one piece of painting of architecture, without breaking friendship and good humour: If indeed they be drunk with wine or zeal, they will be apt to fight about the church, or something else: But why men in their senses should clamour and quarrel at their neighbour's particular con∣science, any more than at his particular palate,
<PB N="185" REF="016775_0184_0F9E2EA0147A9590"/>
no reason can be assigned, but the delusions of priestcraft, operating upon its genuine is∣sue, bigotry."—p. 56, 57.</P>
<P>So long as mankind are of different ge∣niuses and dispositions of soul; are differently educated in families, in publick or private schools; go into different tracts of reading and thinking; and shall agree to hold it as an <HI>unalienable right, sacred from the deity,</HI> that they may search, examine and judge for themselves in all matters of religion; they will most certainly differ from one another in their religious tenets and sentiments.</P>
<P>As <HI>Saybrook</HI> Platform gives a right to any ecclesiastick council to decide and finally de∣termine any cause whatsoever, I dissent from it for this reason, viz. that, as there is no institution, precept or example of any eccle∣siastick council in the New Testament; so the whole authority of such a council must be derived from its constituents, <HI>the parties con∣cerned;</HI> and therefore such a council can have no authority but what is given them to decide any cause whatsoever.</P>
<P>Thus much I think proper to offer, at pre∣sent, as a vindication of my renunciation of <HI>Saybrook</HI> Platform, so far as I view it as dif∣fering from the <HI>holy scriptures,</HI> either in its doctrines or discipline. But as I have sug∣gested that <HI>that</HI> book is not so criminal, as that the judgment of an ecclesiastick council
<PB N="186" REF="016775_0185_0F9E2EA0CAF6FDD8"/>
upon articles of faith, or doctrines of religion to the least conceivable prejudice or disad∣vantage of any preacher, professor or church, can be built upon it, or vindicated from it; I mean now to shew that the senti∣ments or our worthy ancestors, the compilers of that book, were perfectly the same with those I have attempted to vindicate in these papers. In the preface to their Confession or Faith, they say, p. 5, 6, "This Confes∣sion of Faith we offer as our firm persuasion, well and fully grounded upon the <HI>holy scrip∣tures,</HI> and commend the same unto all, and particularly to the people of our colony, to be examined, accepted and constantly main∣tained." How is this? Did these good men mean to impose their confession of faith upon the people of Connecticut, and ab∣solutely to require their subscription? Let them answer for themselves. "We do not assume to ourselves, that any thing be taken upon trust from us, but commend to our people these following counsels."</P>
<P N="1">I. "That you be immoveably and un∣changeably agreed in the only sufficient and invariable rule of religion, which is the holy scripture, the fixed canon, incapable of addition or diminution."</P>
<P N="2">II. "That you be determined by this rule in the whole of religion. That your faith be right and divine, the word of God
<PB N="187" REF="016775_0186_0F9E2EA1DC566500"/>
must be the foundation of it, and the autho∣rity of the word the reason of it."</P>
<P N="3">III. "That you be well grounded in the firm truths of religion. We have willingly taken pains to add the holy scriptures, where∣on every point or faith contained in this Con∣fession doth depend, and is borne up by, and commend the same to your diligent perusal, that you be established in the truth, and your <HI>faith rest upon its proper basis, the word of God.</HI>"</P>
<P N="4">IV. Again, p. 8. "That having applied the rule of holy scripture to all the articles of this Confession, and found the same, <HI>upon trial,</HI> the unchangeable and eternal truths of God: you remember and hold them fast, contend earnestly for them as the faith once delivered to the Saints."</P>
<P>Again, in their Confession of Faith itself, Art. X. "The supreme <HI>judge</HI> by which all <HI>controversies</HI> of religion are to be <HI>determined,</HI> and all <HI>decrees</HI> of <HI>councils, opinions</HI> of <HI>ancient writers, doctrines</HI> of men and private spirits, are to be <HI>examined,</HI> and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the holy scripture delivered by the spirit; into which scripture so delivered our faith is finally re∣solved."</P>
<P>I now willingly leave it to the world to judge, whether the compilers of <HI>Saybrook</HI> Platform, did not firmly believe that all
<PB N="188" REF="016775_0187_0F9E2EA59E6F4668"/>
christians were happy in the enjoyment of the <HI>divine</HI> and <HI>unalienable right</HI> to search the <HI>holy scriptures;</HI> and to receive or reject whatever opinions and sentiments they judg∣ed agreeable or repugnant to that unerring standard: And consequently that no man, or body of men, had <HI>authority</HI> to frame con∣fessions of faith and impose them on others.</P>
<P>These things being undeniable, how any man, or body of men, should presume to judge for others, as to <HI>articles of faith</HI> and <HI>doc∣trines of religion,</HI> and to censure and condemn their fellow christians, on account of their differing <HI>sentiments</HI> and <HI>opinions,</HI> as to the <HI>interpretation</HI> of <HI>holy scriptures;</HI> and even <HI>withdraw communion</HI> and <HI>fellowship</HI> from those who differ from them, and deny them many of the advantages of christian society; or even any advantages whatsoever; and pre∣tend at the same time a warrant for this conduct from <HI>Saybrook Platform,</HI> and, what is more shocking yet, from the <HI>New Testa∣ment;</HI> must be resolved either into their shameful misinterpretation of the Platform and New Testament both; or their bold and daring presumption, pride, arrogance, and itch for dominion over others consciences.</P>
<P>It is a shame and scandal to those who conduct in this unreasonable and unscriptural manner, if not to religion itself, that it should
<PB N="189" REF="016775_0188_0F9E2EA6F21BD1E0"/>
be <HI>'told in Gath, or published in the streets of Askelon:'</HI> For <HI>'the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice, the daughters of the uncircum∣cised will triumph:'</HI> The enemies of our ho∣ly profession will blaspheme, when they shall behold christians crumbling into parts and factions, condemning and anathematizing one another, excommunicating and being ex∣communicated, and alternately depriving and being deprived of the advantages of christian society and communion: Because they can∣not tolerate one another in searching and examining the sacred canon, and believing or rejecting what they shall judge agreeable or repugnant to it!</P>
<P>I will conclude what I shall offer on this subject with that very remarkable paragraph of the renowned <HI>Chillingworth,</HI> which, I fancy, no true protestant will read or hear, but with great satisfaction, especially when they consider that it is the language of a great man, converted from popery by his diligent search of the <HI>sacred scriptures.</HI> Ad∣dressing himself to a writer of the church of <HI>Rome,</HI> he thus speaks in vindication of the protestant cause, "Know then, Sir, that when I say the religion of protestants is in truth to be preferred before yours; as on the one side, I do not understand by your re∣ligion the doctrine of <HI>Bellarmine</HI> or <HI>Baronius,</HI> or any other private man amongst you; nor
<PB N="190" REF="016775_0189_0F9E2EA800627ED8"/>
the doctrine of the <HI>Sorbonne</HI> or of the <HI>Jesuits,</HI> or of the <HI>Dominicans,</HI> or of any other parti∣cular company or society amongst you; but that wherein you all agree, or profess to agree, the doctrine of the council of <HI>Trent;</HI> so ac∣cordingly on the other side, by the religion of protestants, I do not understand the doc∣trine of <HI>Luther</HI> or <HI>Calvin,</HI> or <HI>Melancthon,</HI> nor the confession of <HI>Augsburgh</HI> or <HI>Geneva,</HI> nor the catechism of <HI>Heidelberg,</HI> nor the articles of the church of <HI>England;</HI> no, nor the har∣mony of protestant creeds and confessions; but that wherein they all agree, and which they all subscribe with one accord, as the un∣doubted perfect rule of their faith and ac∣tions, that is, the bible. The bible, I say, the bible only, is the religion of protestants, whatsoever else they believe besides it: And the plain, irrefragable, and indubitable consequences of it, well may they hold as matters of opinion, but as matters of saith and religion, neither can they with coherence to their own grounds believe it themselves, nor require the belief of it of others, with∣out most high and schismatical presumption. I, for my part, after a long, and (as I verily believe and hope) impartial search of the true way to eternal happiness, do profess plainly that I cannot find any rest for the sole of my foot, but upon this rock only. I see plainly, and with mine own eyes, that there
<PB N="191" REF="016775_0190_0F9E2EA86E38FA30"/>
are popes against popes, councils against councils, some fathers against others, the same fathers against themselves, a consent of fathers of one age, against a consent of fa∣thers of another age, the church of one age against the church of another age. Tradi∣tive interpretations of scripture are pretended; but there are few or none to be found. No tradition but only of scripture can derive it∣self from the fountain, but may be plainly proved to be brought in, in such an age after Christ, or that in such an age it was not. In a word, there is no sufficient certainty but of scripture only, for any considering man to build upon. This, therefore, and this only, I have reason to believe, this I will profess, according to this I will live, and for this, if there be occasion, I will not only willingly, but gladly, loose my life; though I should be sorry that Christians should take it from me. Propose me any thing out of this book, and require whether I believe or no, and seem it never so incomprehensible to human rea∣son, I will subscribe it with hand and heart, as knowing no demonstration can be stronger than this, God hath said so, therefore it is true. In other things, I will take no man's liberty of judging from him, neither shall any man take mine from me. I will think no man the worse man, nor the worse christian, I will love no man the less, for differing in o∣pinion
<PB N="192" REF="016775_0191_0F9E2EA90CA5FDC8"/>
from me; and what measure I mete to others, I expect from them again. I am fully assured that God does not, and there∣fore men ought not, to require any more of any man than this: To believe the <HI>scripture</HI> to be God's word, to endeavour to find the true sense of it, and to live according to it." <HI>History of Religion,</HI> p. 55, 56, 57.</P>
