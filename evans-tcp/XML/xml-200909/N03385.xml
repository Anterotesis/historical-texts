<P><HI>It is of the</HI> LORD's <HI>Mercies that we are not consumed.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>SERMON</HI> Preach'd By Dr. <HI>Colman,</HI> AT THE <HI>Friday-Lecture</HI> in <HI>Brattle-Street, March</HI> 4, 1736, 7. After a most <HI>merciful</HI> and wonderful Preservation of the <HI>Town</HI> from being consumed by <HI>Fire,</HI> which broke out in <HI>Union-Street,</HI> about <HI>Four</HI> that <HI>Morning.</HI></P>
<P>Printed at the earnest Request of the preserved <HI>Nei'bourhood</HI> and <HI>others;</HI> to be in their Houses some <HI>Memorial</HI> of the <HI>Divine Compassions,</HI> and a small Testimony of their <HI>Thank∣fulness</HI> to GOD for the <HI>Deliverance</HI> granted them.</P>
<Q><BIBL>Amos vii. 4, 5, 6.</BIBL> <HI>The</HI> Lord God <HI>called to contend by Fire:</HI> Then said I, O Lord God, <HI>Cease, I beseech Thee! — The</HI> Lord <HI>repented for this; This also shall not be, saith the</HI> Lord.</Q>

<Q><BIBL>Lamentations iii. 22, 23.</BIBL>
<P><HI>It is of the</HI> LORD's <HI>Mercies that we are not consumed, because His Compassions fail not; they are new every Morning.</HI></P></Q>

<P><SEG REND="decorInit">W</SEG>ELL may every One of us, every Day we live, <HI>awake</HI> from our Sleep, and <HI>rise</HI> from our <HI>Beds</HI> with these <HI>high and holy Words</HI> of humble <HI>Confes∣sion</HI> and Acknowledg∣ment, and of thankful joyful <HI>Praises</HI> to the GOD of our Lives, the Num∣bers of whose daily and mighty <HI>Salvations</HI> we know not.</P>
<P><PB N="2" REF="004131_0003_1003D2EDDA0C3E50"/>
Day unto Day utters <HI>these Words</HI> to us, and Night unto Night <HI>shews</HI> them, "<HI>That it is of the</HI> LORD's <HI>Mercies we are not consumed, because His Com∣passions fail not.</HI> But there are the Days &amp; Nights of our more sensible and <HI>singular Preservations,</HI> like this <HI>present</HI> Day to the Families in this <HI>Neigh∣bourhood,</HI> whose Dwellings in the Night past were in the greatest Danger of being <HI>consumed;</HI> when such a <HI>Flame</HI> broke out in the midst of such a <HI>Thicket</HI> of combustible Matter, as is scarce to be found again in the whole <HI>Town.</HI></P>
<P>My Text considers <HI>us,</HI> 1. in our <HI>Sins,</HI> and speaks of <HI>God</HI> in his <HI>Justice</HI> as a <HI>consuming Fire:</HI> It con∣siders us also, 2. under the <HI>Wing</HI> of the <HI>Covenant</HI> of God's <HI>Grace,</HI> and it speaks of the <HI>Mercies and Compassions of God,</HI> to his sinful provoking Peo∣ple, as <HI>new every Morning.</HI></P>
<P>We are here <HI>supposed</HI> every Day to do enough to <HI>provoke</HI> the consuming Anger of our God; and this gives the <HI>Glory</HI> to His Mercies, in all their <HI>Constancy</HI> and <HI>Multitude,</HI> notwithstanding our daily <HI>Forfeitures</HI> of them all, and <HI>Desert</HI> of con∣suming Wrath.</P>
<P>The <HI>Church</HI> in my <HI>Context</HI> was in a manner, and in the very <HI>Letter</HI> consumed; <HI>Judea, Jerusa∣lem,</HI> the <HI>Temple</HI> of God, and his <HI>Synagogues</HI> thro' the Land, were <HI>burnt with Fire;</HI> most of the In∣habitants had been <HI>slain</HI> with the Sword, and the Residue, a small <HI>Remnant,</HI> were led into a doleful <HI>Captivity,</HI> to consume away there for <HI>seventy Years.</HI> This it is that the Prophet <HI>Jere∣miah</HI> is here <HI>lamenting</HI> in the Name of the deso∣late Church; yet never the less, that there was
<PB N="3" REF="004131_0004_1003D2F6898B5C00"/>a Remnant or <HI>escaping,</HI> he acknowledges to be of the <HI>Lord's Mercies,</HI> and of his <HI>unfailing Compassions.</HI></P>
<P>He writes for <HI>our Warning</HI> and learning, on whom the <HI>Ends</HI> of the World are come, and aw∣fully admonishes <HI>us</HI> in the Name of the <HI>Lord,</HI> "That when the Day of Mercy is <HI>past</HI> with Places and Persons, they will be <HI>consumed</HI> by the burning Wrath of God; His Mercies will be <HI>clean gone,</HI> and his Compassions <HI>fail for evermore.</HI> —This Day of Mercy might have been <HI>past with us</HI> long since, and that it is not <HI>so</HI> is because <HI>God's Compassions fail not.</HI></P>
<P>Many more and various are the <HI>Reflections</HI> which the <HI>Text</HI> affords us, but I will content my self with these <HI>three</HI> most plain and easy <HI>Obser∣vations.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. The Lord our God is of great <HI>Mercies and Compassions.</HI> 2. His Compassions <HI>fail not.</HI> 3. Hence it is that <HI>we are not consumed.</HI></P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>The Lord our God is of great Mercies and Com∣passions.</HI> These my <HI>Text</HI> supposes, asserts and magnifies.</P>
<P><HI>Mercy</HI> in God is his Goodness and Grace ex∣tended and exercised toward <HI>sinful Creatures. Compassion</HI> in God speaks <HI>ad Hominem,</HI> to the Pity and <HI>Bowels</HI> of <HI>Human Nature</HI> toward Consorts, Children, Relatives and Friends in Affliction. We know well what a <HI>Mother's</HI> Bowels are, and a <HI>Fa∣ther's</HI> Pity, and a <HI>Friend's</HI> Sympathy; and by these it pleases God (in his great Condescention) to represent the working of his <HI>Mercy</HI> toward his
<PB N="4" REF="004131_0005_1003D2FAA95CAB38"/>People. Psal. ciii. 13. <HI>Like as a Father pitieth his Children so the Lord pitieth them that fear him.</HI> Jer. xxxi 20. <HI>I earnestly remember him, my Bowels are troubled for him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Compassion</HI> in Man causes a <HI>painful</HI> Commotion within him, being mix'd of <HI>Grief</HI> and <HI>Love;</HI> but the <HI>render Mercies</HI> of God are without the Infir∣mity of our Pity.</P>
<P>No wonder that the <HI>Scripture</HI> abounds in this most <HI>endearing</HI> Representation of God to us; for if he will be a God to <HI>Sinners,</HI> He must be a God of Compassion.</P>
<P>It speaks <HI>all the Glories</HI> of the Name of God, proclaimed before <HI>Moses, "merciful, gracious, long∣suffering and abundant in Goodness.</HI> Psal lxxxvi. 15. <HI>But thou, O Lord, art a God full of Compassion and gracious, longsuffering and plenteous in Mercy.</HI> And again, Psal. cxlv. 8. <HI>The Lord is gracious and full of Compassion, slow to Anger, and of great Mercy.</HI></P>
<P>But there is no Expression more <HI>moving</HI> than that, Isai lxiii 15. <HI>The sounding of thy Bowels, and of thy Mercy toward me:</HI> and that, Luke i. 78. <HI>The Bowels of the Mercy of our God.</HI> The Bowels of a God are more <HI>tender</HI> than those of a Father or Mother: Isai. xlix 15. <HI>Can a Woman forget her sucking Child, that she should not have Compassion on the Son of her Womb? yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee.</HI></P>
<P>When the <HI>Apostle</HI> would raise us to the last Pitch of Brotherly Love and Goodness, he bids us <HI>put on Bowels of Mercies;</HI> and when <HI>another</HI>
<PB N="5" REF="004131_0006_1003D307C38AE028"/>Apostle is naming the Love of God to us, he as vehemently forbids <HI>our shutting up Bowels of Com∣passion</HI> from one another.</P>
<P><HI>Such</HI> are the <HI>Divine Compassions:</HI> And if you <HI>ask,</HI> "Whence then is it that we see so many <HI>Objects of Misery</HI> round about us, and that the <HI>Children of God</HI> themselves are so often the <HI>Sub∣jects</HI> of grievous Afflictions? the <HI>Answer</HI> is easy,</P>
<P N="1">1. They are of our <HI>Selves</HI> and our <HI>Sins;</HI> this is the <HI>Original</HI> and meritorious Cause of them: We may not charge <HI>God</HI> with them, but must take the Blame and Shame of them to our Selves. Lament. i. 18. <HI>The Lord is righteous, for we have rebelled against him.</HI> Jer. ii. 19. <HI>Hast thou not pro∣cured this unto thy Self? thine own Wickedness shall correct thee, and thy Backslidings shall reprove thee: Know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter that thou hast forsaken the Lord thy God, and that my Fear is not in thee, saith the Lord God of Hosts.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. God sends <HI>sore Afflictions</HI> on Sinners very often in <HI>great Mercy</HI> and in tender <HI>Pity:</HI> to con∣vince them of the Evil of their Sins, to bring them to Repentance, and so to prepare them for the Favours of his Providence and the Comforts of his Grace in this Life, and for his Everlast∣ing Mercies in that to come. Rev. iii. 19. <HI>Whom I love I rebuke and chasten, be zealous therefore and repent.</HI> Heb. xii. 6. <HI>For whom the Lord loveth he chastneth, as a Father his Son in whom he delighteth.</HI> —A loving <HI>Parent</HI> corrects his Son from a real and strong Affection, and from true <HI>Compassion.</HI> A Father can be very <HI>angry</HI> with a sinning Child, but upon his Humiliation and Repentance he
<PB N="6" REF="004131_0007_1003B58AC435E180"/><HI>tenders</HI> him again. And so does our <HI>Heavenly Father:</HI> Jerem. xxxi. 18. <HI>I have surely heard E∣phraim bemoaning himself thus, "Thou hast chastised me,</HI> &amp;c: "Is he <HI>a dear Son, is he a pleasant Child? for I do earnestly remember him still, I will surely have Mercy on him, faith the Lord.</HI> Souls in the deepest Humiliation of Repentance, should be in the strongest Exercise of Faith in the Divine Compassions. This is in a lively manner repre∣sented in my <HI>Context,</HI> Ver. 28—32. <HI>He sitteth alone and keepeth Silence, he putteth his Mouth in the Dust, he is filled with Reproach; for the Lord will not cast off for ever, but tho' he cause Grief yet will be have Compassion, according to the Multitude of his Mercies; for he doth not willingly afflict or grieve the Children of Men.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. I am now to go on, and say of these Di∣vine <HI>Compassions</HI> and Mercies, that they <HI>fail not:</HI> No, they are <HI>new every Morning:</HI> they continue and abide, keep their Course and go their Round; returning on us as constantly as the <HI>Day</HI> and as the <HI>Sun</HI> do. Every Day brings <HI>new</HI> Mercies; and they are like the <HI>Rayes of Light</HI> for Number and for Kind, bright and conspicuous, and in infinite endless Successions. Or if you will take the Comparison from the living Springs and Fountains of <HI>Water,</HI> which send forth their chris∣tal Streams day and night for our Supply and Refreshment; <HI>God</HI> is this <HI>Fountain of living Wa∣ter; a Spring of Water, whose Waters fail not,</HI> Isai. lviii. 11.</P>
<P>We read of the Blessed <HI>God,</HI> that He is <HI>rich</HI> in in Mercy, <HI>plenteous</HI> in Mercy, <HI>abundant</HI> in Mercy,
<PB N="7" REF="004131_0008_1003D31B2574A368"/>and that it is <HI>Everlasting:</HI> A Mercy that <HI>never fails</HI> must be <HI>all</HI> this, can be nothing less.</P>
<P>As God is in <HI>Himself,</HI> such must his <HI>Mercies</HI> be. If <HI>He</HI> be the immense infinite <HI>Being,</HI> eternal and unchangeable; how should his Compassions <HI>fail?</HI> any more than Eternity and Infinity be exhausted.— With what a <HI>Run</HI> of Repetition therefore, and of Pleasure, does the <HI>Holy Ghost</HI> teach us to sing of a <HI>Mercy</HI> that never fails? Psal. cxxxvi. "<HI>For his Mercy endureth for Ever! for his Mercy endureth for Ever!</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>The Compassions of God may <HI>cease</HI> indeed toward particular <HI>Persons</HI> and <HI>Places,</HI> and yet <HI>He</HI> remain the <HI>same</HI> Compassionate God: His <HI>Spi∣rit will not always strive</HI> with provoking Sinners; the Day of his Grace <HI>ends</HI> with many, and with some sooner than with others: His Mercies <HI>cease for ever</HI> as to <HI>impenitent</HI> Sinners, and are <HI>gone for evermore</HI> as to them that <HI>die</HI> so: But they can never fail <HI>at all</HI> toward the proper and only <HI>Ob∣jects</HI> of them, or in that <HI>Course</HI> which the Holi∣ness and Wisdom of God has settled for the per∣petual and everlasting Display of them: The Immutability of God and the Promises of his Word make it impossible. Isai. xxx. 18. <HI>There∣fore will the Lord</HI> wait <HI>that he may be gracious, and will be exalted in shewing Mercy, for the Lord is a God of Judgment, and blessed are all they that wait for him.</HI> As God's <HI>Righteousness</HI> is like the great Mountains, high and conspicuous, fix'd and im∣movable; so his <HI>Compassions</HI> stand upon his <HI>Truth</HI> and Faithfulness: Isai. liv. 10. <HI>The Mountains shall depart, and the Hills be removed; but my Kind∣ness shall not depart from thee, nor the Covenant of my
<PB N="8" REF="004131_0009_1003D31F0FD35888"/>Peace be removed, faith the Lord that hath Mercy on thee.</HI></P>
<P>We have highly <HI>deserved</HI> that the Compassions of God should have been at <HI>an utter End,</HI> as to <HI>us,</HI> long ago; yet they have not <HI>failed</HI> even to <HI>us</HI> evil &amp; unthankful, unto this Day; no not in any or all of the <HI>Afflictions</HI> that have come upon us for our <HI>Sins:</HI> Ezra ix. 13. <HI>Thou Lord hash punished us less than our Iniquities have deserved.</HI> Psal. lxxviii. 38. <HI>But He being full of Compassion destroyed them not, yea many a time turned he his Anger away, and did not stir up all his Wrath.</HI></P>
<P>I come therefore to say,</P>
<P N="3">III. Hence it is that <HI>we are not consumed;</HI> even of the <HI>Lord's Mercies,</HI> and because <HI>they fail not:</HI></P>
<P>Let us <HI>turn aside</HI> and see this <HI>great Sight,</HI> this Wonder of Grace! like that which <HI>Moses</HI> had in <HI>Horeb;</HI> he saw <HI>a Bush on Fire, and it was not consumed!</HI> My <HI>Text</HI> gives us the same Sight of <HI>God,</HI> as a <HI>consuming Fire,</HI> and of <HI>our Selves</HI> as Chaff and <HI>Stubble</HI> before devouring Fire, and yet not <HI>consumed</HI> thereby. As the <HI>Word</HI> of God, so a wicked <HI>World</HI> is full of these <HI>two</HI> things; the <HI>flaming Anger</HI> of God against Sin, and yet a Multitude of Sinners not <HI>consumed</HI> thereby.</P>
<P>The Reason and <HI>Cause</HI> of this is to be <HI>sought,</HI> and can be only <HI>found</HI> in God Himself: It is of the <HI>Lord's Mercies</HI> and his unfailing Compassions. Not for <HI>our</HI> Repentance, or <HI>Righteousness,</HI> be it <HI>known</HI> to us, but for His own <HI>Name</HI> and <HI>Mercy</HI> sake. "<HI>Not unto us, O Lord!</HI> must we say, <HI>Not unto us! but to Thy Name give Glory; for thy Mercy
<PB N="9" REF="004131_0010_1003D323FB66F478"/>and for thy Truths sake,</HI> Psal. cxv. 1. As we must take our <HI>Pleas</HI> in Prayer from God <HI>Himself,</HI> his own <HI>Perfections</HI> Word and Works; so we must <HI>ascribe</HI> to the Glory of his Name and <HI>Attributes</HI> in our Adorations and Thanksgivings.</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> We behold God here in his <HI>Justice</HI> and in his <HI>Judgments</HI> a <HI>consuming Fire;</HI> and Sinners the <HI>Chaff</HI> and Stubble, ready to be <HI>consumed.</HI> Heb. xii. 29. <HI>For the Lord our God is a consuming Fire.</HI> God is <HI>angry</HI> with the wicked every Day. His holy Anger <HI>burns</HI> against the provoking Trans∣gressors of his righteous Law, and if it falls upon them they are <HI>consumed.</HI> We read of the <HI>Heat</HI> of his Anger, and of its <HI>smoaking</HI> against a Person or People. This is <HI>seen</HI> and <HI>felt</HI> in his <HI>Judgments,</HI> of one Kind or of another. Exod. xxxii. 10. <HI>Let me alone, that my Wrath may wax</HI> hot <HI>against them, that I may</HI> consume <HI>them.</HI> Isai. v. 24. <HI>As the Fire devoureth the Stubble, and the Flame con∣sumeth the Chaff; so is the Anger of the Lord kindled against his People.</HI></P>
<P>God easily consumes a wicked People by pes∣tilential <HI>Sicknesses,</HI> by <HI>Famine</HI> or <HI>War;</HI> by <HI>Fires</HI> ashore and by <HI>Storms</HI> at Sea. He needs not call for his more <HI>strange</HI> Works of Terror, <HI>Earthquakes</HI> and <HI>Inundations.</HI> He burns down our <HI>Bodies</HI> as well as our <HI>Dwellings,</HI> when he pleases. The various <HI>Fevers</HI> that consume us from our Dwell∣ings, are but so many putrid noxious <HI>Fires</HI> within us, which God kindles &amp; quenches as he pleases. Psal. xxxix. 10, 11. <HI>Remove thy Stroke away from me, I am consumed by the Blow of thy Hand.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="004131_0011_1003D32B2B8B6A48"/>
The <HI>Fire</HI> of God's <HI>Wrath</HI> is yet <HI>seven times hot∣ter</HI> in the <HI>Souls</HI> and <HI>Consciences</HI> of Sinners; and the <HI>Flame</HI> of it drinks up their <HI>Spirits. Hell Torments</HI> are represented to us by a <HI>Worm</HI> that never <HI>dies,</HI> and by <HI>Fire unquenchable.</HI> This <HI>Tophet is ordained of old,</HI> from the Day wherein the <HI>Angels</HI> fell it was <HI>prepared;</HI> it is <HI>deep and large, the Pile thereof is Fire and much Wood; the Breath of the Lord, like a Stream of Brimstone, doth kindle it.</HI> This <HI>Lake of Fire</HI> is the <HI>second Death.</HI> Souls are <HI>tormented in this Flame,</HI> and never <HI>consumed.</HI> This is Ven∣geance to the uttermost, "<HI>the Vengeance of Eter∣nal Fire:—Consume them in Wrath, consume them, that they may not be!</HI> But Oh! they can never cease to be! the <HI>Smoke of their Torment ariseth for ever and ever!</HI> and so continues their <HI>Weeping and Wailing and gnashing of Teeth</HI> unto Eternal Ages!—Let us tremble at the Thought of this <HI>devouring Fire,</HI> these <HI>everlasting Burnings!</HI> God has mercifully <HI>warned us to flee from this Wrath to come,</HI> and to <HI>bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance.</HI> Wherefore let us turn again our Eyes, and see</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> GOD in his <HI>Mercies</HI> and <HI>Compassions</HI> sparing, preserving and <HI>saving</HI> Sinners from be∣ing <HI>consumed</HI> by his Wrath. In the Riches of his Patience, Forbearance, and Long-suffering, he <HI>waiteth</HI> on them to be gracious: He <HI>reveals</HI> his saving Mercies to them, he <HI>offers</HI> it; shows 'em the <HI>Way</HI> of it, how it <HI>can</HI> be glorified to them, and then tenderly <HI>invites</HI> and <HI>beseeches</HI> them to seek after it and accept of it. He calls on them by his <HI>Word,</HI> strives with them by his <HI>Spirit,</HI> sends all his Servants his <HI>Ministers, rising up early and sending them; allures</HI> them by the Mercies and <HI>Sal∣vations</HI> of his Providence, and <HI>awakens</HI> them by
<PB N="11" REF="004131_0012_1003B59772193200"/>his <HI>Judgments:</HI> He calls on 'em to <HI>repent,</HI> gives them a <HI>Space</HI> for Repentance, threatens 'em in their <HI>Impenitence,</HI> and yet in his Compassions tries 'em again, with <HI>Line upon Line</HI> and <HI>Precept upon Precept.</HI> The Language of all this we have in Isai. lxiii. 6, 7. <HI>For he said, surely they are my People, Children that will not lie, so he was their Sa∣viour: In all their Affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of his Presence saved them: In his Love and in his Pity he redeemed them; he hare them and car∣ried them all the Days of old.</HI></P>
<P>Thus it is of the <HI>Lord's Mercies</HI> that we are not consumed by <HI>temporal</HI> Judgments, and cut off by the Blow of his Hand; and it is yet more of his <HI>Mercies</HI> that our <HI>Souls</HI> are not roaring under that <HI>Fire</HI> of his Wrath, which <HI>burns to the lowest Hell.</HI></P>
<P>It is of his <HI>Sovereignty,</HI> who <HI>has Mercy on whom he will have Mercy, and hath Compassion because he will have Compassion:</HI> Rom. ix. 15. And <HI>what if God willing to shew his Wrath and to make his Power known, endure with much Long-suffering the Vessels of Wrath fitted for Destruction.</HI></P>
<P>It is of his <HI>Unchangeableness</HI> and <HI>Faithfulness,</HI> as it follows on my <HI>Text, "Great is his Faithfulness!</HI> and as He tells us of Himself, Mal iii. 16. "<HI>I am the Lord, I change not; therefore the Sons of Jacob are not consumed.</HI></P>
<P>But in short, It is owing to the <HI>Sacrifice of Christ for Sin,</HI> that the <HI>Mercies</HI> of the Lord and his <HI>Compassions</HI> are so great and <HI>unfailing</HI> toward us, and <HI>new</HI> every Day. All the <HI>Mercies</HI> of God
<PB N="12" REF="004131_0013_1003D3335BADB568"/>come to us thro' our <HI>Lord Jesus;</HI> and for His Sake it is that we are not <HI>consumed.</HI> The con∣suming Anger of God <HI>fell on Him,</HI> who was <HI>able</HI> to bear it; and bore it <HI>for us,</HI> and bears it away <HI>from</HI> us. He was made <HI>Sin</HI> for us, and bore the <HI>Weight</HI> of Divine Wrath in his holy <HI>Soul;</HI> made his Soul <HI>an Offering,</HI> to satisfy and appease the in∣censed Justice of God; and it is the <HI>Water and Blood from his pierced Side</HI> that <HI>quenches</HI> the burn∣ing Wrath of God, which <HI>preys</HI> upon unbeliev∣ing and impenitent Sinners for ever and ever. The <HI>Reprieve</HI> and Respite of our forfeited <HI>Lives</HI> from instant <HI>Death,</HI> and even the daily Preserva∣tion of our <HI>Dwellings</HI> from consuming <HI>Flames,</HI> is from the <HI>sprinkling</HI> of the <HI>Blood</HI> of this our sacri∣ficed <HI>Lord</HI> and <HI>Passover</HI> on our Houses and Fami∣lies. Christians should thus see and adore their <HI>Saviour,</HI> in all the <HI>common</HI> Mercies of their Lives from Day to Day. God grants us <HI>Life and Fa∣vour</HI> for <HI>Christ's</HI> sake: "<HI>He</HI> redeemeth our Life from Destruction, and crowns us with Loving∣kindness and tender Mercies.</P>
<P>And now to lead You into some <HI>Application</HI> and suitable <HI>Improvement</HI> of the present Truth;</P>
<P N="1">I. Let the great <HI>Mercies</HI> and <HI>Compassions</HI> of our God <HI>endear his blessed Name to us,</HI> and command our thankful <HI>Love</HI> and joyful <HI>Praises.</HI> God is <HI>Love!</HI> how glorious an Object of Admiration and Adoration does He appear to us in this <HI>Idea!</HI> How great is his <HI>Goodness,</HI> how great is his <HI>Beauty!</HI> So when the Lord was pleased to make all his <HI>Glory</HI> to pass before <HI>Moses,</HI> He proclaimed his <HI>Name, "The Lord God, gracious and merciful, long∣suffering

<P N="2">II. Let us desire to be <HI>like</HI> the blessed God in <HI>this</HI> his Glory; to be <HI>merciful and compassionate to Those that are in Misery,</HI> in Want and <HI>Indigence,</HI> as God is to us. This is the <HI>Rule</HI> and Law that <HI>Christ</HI> has given us, Luke vi. 36. <HI>Be ye therefore merciful, a your Father is also merciful.</HI> In this let us <HI>be Followers of God as dear Children and walk in Love.</HI> The merciful God cannot bear unmerci∣fulness in us. Mat xviii. 33. <HI>Oughtest not thou to have Compassion on thy Fellow-Servant, even as I piti∣ed thee?</HI> The Argument of the <HI>Apostle John</HI> car∣ries strong Conviction in it, 1 John iii. 17. <HI>Who∣so hath this World's Goods, and seeth his Brother have Need, and shutteth up his Bowels of Compassion from him; how dwelleth the Love of God in him?</HI> This is pure Religion from the Days of <HI>Job,</HI> but car∣ried to a greater Height by the Gospel of <HI>Christ.</HI> He was a <HI>Type</HI> of Christ as well in the Days of his <HI>Prosperity</HI> as <HI>Adversity. "Did I not weep for him that was in Trouble?</HI> said he; <HI>Was not my Soul grieved for the Poor? "If I withheld them from their Desire, or caused the Eyes of the Widow to fail! if I have eaten my Morsel alone, and the Fa∣therless hath not eaten thereof? if I have seen any perish for want of Cloathing, or the Poor without Covering!</HI></P>
<P>But <HI>Christ</HI> commendeth his <HI>Love</HI> to us, in that while we were <HI>Enemies</HI> he died for us. In this <HI>David</HI> was his royal <HI>Type,</HI> Psal. xxxv. 11, 12. <HI>False Witnesses did rise up, they laid to my Charge things that I knew not; they rewarded me Evil for Good to the spoiling of my Soul; But as for me, when they were
<PB N="14" REF="004131_0015_1003D339230D5BB0"/>sick my Cloathing was Sackcloth,</HI> &amp;c. Such a <HI>Law</HI> well became the Mouth of <HI>Christ, "I say unto you, Love your Enemies.</HI> He has given the Illus∣trious <HI>Example,</HI> in his Compassions on <HI>us.</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. Let us admire God in his <HI>Eternity and Un∣changeableness;</HI> because his Compassions <HI>fail not,</HI> but are <HI>new every Morning.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Incommunicable</HI> Attributes of God give infinite Glory to his <HI>other</HI> Perfections. They are <HI>all</HI> eternal and immutable. These highest Glo∣ries of the <HI>Godhead</HI> exalt Him above all Blessing and Praise. It is <HI>High,</HI> and we cannot attain unto it.</P>
<P N="1">1. Here is <HI>everlasting Consolation</HI> to the People of God. They have the eternal Truth and Power of an Unchangeable God to trust in. Read how the <HI>Prophet</HI> mildly rebukes their <HI>Fears,</HI> and tenderly reproaches the <HI>Weakness</HI> of their Faith, when they were ready to <HI>stagger</HI> at the Promise in the Day of <HI>Trial</HI> and Affliction: Isai. xl. 27,—31. <HI>Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest O Israel, My Way is hid from the Lord, and my Judg∣ment is passed over from my God? Hast thou not known, hast thou not heard, that the Everlasting God, the Lord, the Creator of the Ends of the Earth, faint∣eth not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his Understanding. He giveth Power to the faint, and to them that have no Might be increaseth Strength: E∣ven the Youths shall faint and be weary, and the young Men shall utterly fail; but they that wait on the Lord shall renew their Strength; they shall mount up with Wings as Eagles; they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="15" REF="004131_0016_1003B5A30190A280"/>
2. Let us see to it that <HI>we be interested in</HI> and <HI>are the Objects of</HI> the Divine Compassions. Else what signifies it to <HI>us</HI> that they <HI>can never fail</HI> to∣ward the <HI>proper</HI> Objects of them. Unless we re∣pent of our Sins, and believe in Christ, and sub∣mit to Him as our Lord and Saviour, and obey the Gospel, we do not put our Selves in the Way of his sure and everlasting <HI>Mercies:</HI> Nay we are sure to be at last <HI>consumed</HI> by the Fire of God's Wrath. This is the <HI>sad Case</HI> of the finally <HI>im∣penitent</HI> and ungodly, that the Compassions of God do <HI>not at all</HI> belong to them; but while Compassion is glorified for Ever on the <HI>Vessels of Mercy,</HI> Wrath lies on them to all Eternity.</P>
<P N="3">3. Let us learn to be <HI>constant and fixed</HI> in a merciful Spirit. This shall be some Feature and <HI>Image</HI> of the unchangeably good God, stampt on us. I will not say we must be <HI>unchangeably</HI> good, but as much <HI>so</HI> as we can. We must <HI>hold fast</HI> that which is good, and <HI>continue</HI> in well do∣ing. It is he that <HI>endureth</HI> to the End, that is <HI>saved.</HI> If we <HI>forgive</HI> it must be until <HI>seventy times seven,</HI> and if we <HI>give,</HI> it must be to <HI>seven</HI> and to <HI>eight.</HI> As <HI>Objects</HI> and <HI>Opportunities</HI> return, and as <HI>Ability</HI> continues, so we must <HI>do good to all Men, especially to the Houshold of Faith.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. As God's Compassions <HI>fail not</HI> to us, so never let our Devotion, Gratitude and Obedi∣ence <HI>fail toward Him.</HI> True <HI>Charity,</HI> be it the Love of <HI>God</HI> or of our <HI>Nei'bour, never faileth:</HI> 1 Cor. xiii. 8. That lives in Death, when Faith comes to an End; it goes with the Soul into Hea∣ven and is there made perfect. It is the Princi∣ple of <HI>lively</HI> Devotion and Obedience, and <HI>new</HI>
<PB N="16" REF="004131_0017_1003D340DA9271C8"/>every Morning: An immortal Seed and has eter∣nal Life in it. It is the fulfilling of the Law, in a Course of universal delightful Obedience. It <HI>rejoiceth and worketh Righteousness;</HI> rejoices in the Lord <HI>always,</HI> and lifts up the Heart and Feet in God's Ways.— Great indeed should be our <HI>Faithfulness</HI> in the Covenant of God, because his <HI>Compassions</HI> and Covenant-Faithfulness toward us does <HI>not fail.</HI> As these are <HI>new</HI> to us every day, so they should cause us to <HI>renew</HI> our Strength; to walk before him and be perfecting Holiness in his Fear. Let it be our Care not to <HI>fail</HI> God's righteous Expectations from us. 1 Cor. xv. ult. <HI>Wherefore my beloved Brethren; be ye stedfast, immov∣able, always abounding in the Work of the Lord; for as much as ye know that your Labour is not in vain in the Lord.</HI></P>
<P N="4">IV. Is it of the Lord's Mercies <HI>that we are not consumed?</HI> We learn</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>The great Evil in Sin.</HI> It is a <HI>consuming</HI> thing to us. It consumes our <HI>Bodies,</HI> our <HI>Families,</HI> our worldly Substance and Comforts; and it con∣sumes our <HI>Souls,</HI> their Powers, Pleasures and eternal Life.</P>
<P><HI>Death</HI> bodily and spiritual is the <HI>Wages of Sin.</HI> It is a <HI>Consumption</HI> on the Body while we <HI>live</HI> in it, by various Maladies and Pains, which bring on its consuming away in the <HI>Grave</HI> from our Dwellings, Psal. xlix. 14. This sorrowful <HI>Note</HI> is repeated, Psal xc. <HI>For we are consumed by thy Anger, and by thy Wrath we are troubled: Thou hast set our Iniquities before thee, our secret Sins in the Light of thy Countenance; For all our Days are passed away in thy Wrath.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="004131_0018_1003D3468DDD06C8"/>
But <HI>spiritual</HI> and eternal Death consumes the <HI>Soul.</HI> It is <HI>dead</HI> while it lives, and the <HI>second Death</HI> has power over it. It is <HI>buried</HI> in Earth here, and in the bottomless <HI>Pit</HI> of Corruption for ever. It goes to the <HI>Generation</HI> of the miserable, unclean and accursed Spirits in Darkness, never to see Light.—Our Days here are <HI>consumed</HI> in Va∣nity and our Years in Trouble, by our <HI>Sins,</HI> those unfruitful Works of Darkness; but how a mise∣rable <HI>Eternity</HI> will consume away, or a <HI>Soul</HI> in the Flames of Hell which consume it not, no Mind can now conceive nor Words express.</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Anger</HI> of God is a <HI>dreadful</HI> thing, and He is <HI>terrible</HI> in his <HI>Justice</HI> to impenitent Sinners. We should <HI>fear</HI> before the <HI>Holy One</HI> always, as they did at <HI>Horeb:</HI> When they saw the <HI>burning Mountain</HI> and heard the roaring <HI>Thunders,</HI> they said '<HI>this great Fire will consume us.</HI> Deut. v. 25. Even <HI>Moses</HI> himself said, "<HI>I exceedingly fear &amp; quake.</HI> Who knows the Power of God's <HI>Anger?</HI> infinitely beyond all our <HI>Fears</HI> is his Wrath. Destructi∣on from God should be a <HI>Terror</HI> to the Wicked, for they are liable to be consumed every Moment. "God judgeth the <HI>righteous,</HI> but he is angry with the <HI>wicked</HI> every Day: if he turn not he will <HI>whet</HI> his Sword, he hath <HI>bent</HI> his Bow and made it ready; he has <HI>prepared</HI> for him the Instruments of Death. "God is <HI>jealous</HI> and the Lord reveng∣eth, he reserveth <HI>Wrath</HI> for his Enemies: He is slow to Anger and great in Power, and will not at all acquit the Wicked: the Hills <HI>melt</HI> and the Earth is <HI>burnt</HI> up at his Presence: Who can stand before his Indignation? &amp; who can abide in the Fierceness of his Anger? Yet is the Lord <HI>good,</HI> a strong Hold in the Day of Trouble, and he knoweth them that <HI>trust</HI> in him,</P>
<P N="3"><PB N="18" REF="004131_0019_1003B5A984A35120"/>
3. See what we owe to <HI>Christ,</HI> of whose <HI>Merits</HI> and Righteousness it is that we are <HI>not consumed;</HI> or that the holy God can have Mercy and Com∣passion on us. The naked Eye of <HI>Nature</HI> sees the abundant Mercies of God in a World of Sin, but it is only in the <HI>Glass</HI> of the Gospel that it can make any true Observation thereof. No Idea of <HI>absolute</HI> Goodness reaches the Case of the Divine <HI>Compassions</HI> toward us. The <HI>Angels</HI> of Heaven therefore look <HI>down</HI> intently on the <HI>Mercy Seat,</HI> and admire the great <HI>Propitiation</HI> for Sin in the Death of Christ. We must look <HI>up,</HI> and lift up our Hearts with our Eyes to the <HI>Lamb slain</HI> in the Midst of the Throne of God, and say— "<HI>God who is rich in Mercy, for his great Love wherewith he loved us, who were by Nature Children of Wrath and dead in Sins, to show the exceeding Riches of his Grace, in his Kindness toward us thro Jesus Christ!</HI> Eph. ii. 4, 7. Words cannot be put together, to reach this amazing Grace.</P>
<P N="4">4. Is it of the Lord's <HI>Mercies</HI> that we are <HI>not consumed?</HI> it loudly and earnestly calls upon us to <HI>repent</HI> of our Sins, and should be a powerful <HI>Constraint</HI> of Grace upon us. The sparing <HI>Mercies</HI> and the consuming <HI>Judgments</HI> of God, his threat∣ned <HI>Wrath</HI> and his Bowels of <HI>Compassion,</HI> have one <HI>Voice</HI> to us, and should have the same <HI>Effect</HI> on us.</P>
<P>And I. May the <HI>Judgments</HI> of God not <HI>con∣sume</HI> us, but <HI>refine</HI> us; purge away our <HI>dross</HI> and refine us as <HI>Silver.</HI> This is the <HI>Mercy</HI> of God meant and shown to his <HI>chosen</HI> People, the called by his Grace; and the Evangelical <HI>Prophes</HI> abounds in this Account of the Mind and Will
<PB N="19" REF="004131_0020_1003D1234219C7E0"/>of God in the Judgments of his Providence
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Isaiah i. 25, 26. xxvii. 9. xlviii. 10.</NOTE>: "<HI>I will turn my Hand upon thee, and purely purge a∣way thy Dross, and take away all thy Tin: Zion shall be redeemed with Judgment and her Converts with Righteousness; &amp; thou shalt be called the City of Righ∣teousness, the faithful City. "By this shall the Iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the Fruit to take away his Sin "For my Name sake will I defer my Anger, and for my Praise will I refrain from thee, that I cut thee not off: Behold I have refined thee but not with Silver,</HI> "not in so vehement a Fire as Silver is refined, <HI>I have chosen thee in the Furnace of Affliction: For my own sake, even for my own, will I do it</HI> O the <HI>dear</HI> Love and Mercy in such <HI>sanc∣tified</HI> Afflictons! it is enough to make us <HI>zealous in repenting</HI> when God afflicts us. And so</P>
<P N="2">2. The <HI>Mercies</HI> and Bounties of Providence; and all the <HI>Salvations</HI> of it from Day to Day, should have the like <HI>saving Effect</HI> on us; and all the <HI>Goodness of God should lead us to Repentance.</HI> Rom. ii. 4. Those memorable and awful <HI>Words</HI> should come with Power on our Hearts; "<HI>Or despisest thou the Riches of this Goodness, Forbearance and Long∣suffering? and after thy Hardness &amp; impenitent Heart treasurest up Wrath against the Day of Wrath.</HI></P>
<P>In the Day of <HI>Sodom,</HI> the <HI>Angels</HI> those Ministers of Vengeance on the wicked City, hastened <HI>Lot</HI> early in the Morning, saying, <HI>Arise, lest thou be consumed!</HI> and while he <HI>lingred</HI> they laid <HI>hold</HI> on his Hand, the Lord being <HI>merciful</HI> to him, and bro't him out and his <HI>Family</HI> with him, and bid them again <HI>escape to the Mountain, lest they should be consumed.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="004131_0021_1003D35044FF76F8"/>
So <HI>Mercy</HI> would always <HI>rejoice</HI> over us in the midst of <HI>Judgment,</HI> and save us from the Flames of <HI>Hell,</HI> that <HI>Lake of Fire and Brimstone,</HI> whereof the polluted <HI>Cities of the Plain</HI> were set forth for an <HI>Ex∣ample, suffering the Vengeance of eternal Fire,</HI> Jude <HI>v.</HI> 7.</P>
<P>O the <HI>Mercy</HI> to Sinners when the <HI>common</HI> Mer∣cies, or the <HI>singular</HI> Salvations of Providence, prove <HI>saving</HI> to them! This is indeed to the <HI>Praise</HI> of the <HI>Glory</HI> of Divine <HI>Grace!</HI> Here is Goodness car∣ried to the highest <HI>Pitch!</HI> so it would bring forth <HI>after its Kind!</HI> as a <HI>Corn of Wheat</HI> sown in the Earth, to yield <HI>sixty or an hundred-fold.</HI></P>
<P>God would have <HI>every</HI> Mercy of our Lives work <HI>thus.</HI> The <HI>Well of Water</HI> at your Door, he would have rise and <HI>spring up unto eternal Life;</HI> become <HI>Water of Life</HI> to us even <HI>now</HI> in our Way to Hea∣ven. Every <HI>Gift</HI> of Providence, and all the <HI>Sal∣vations</HI> of it are in the Hand of <HI>Christ,</HI> and He would have them minister to our <HI>Eternal Salvation.</HI></P>
<P>O blessed <HI>Provinces,</HI> whatever they are for <HI>Kind,</HI> that are holily improv'd, and in the <HI>End</HI> prove Means of our <HI>Sanctification!</HI> How are such <HI>Bounties</HI> of Providence the Fruits and Evidences of the <HI>Love of God in Christ Jesus</HI> to our Souls! and how are such <HI>Afflictions</HI> made <HI>joyous</HI> in the Islue, however <HI>greivous</HI> they may be for the pre∣sent! Wise and happy they <HI>that sowe beside all Waters,</HI> and make Advantage of every <HI>Wind</HI> and of all <HI>Weather:</HI> They are certainly under a <HI>Di∣vine</HI> Conduct and Blessing, and <HI>all Things</HI> shall work together unto the <HI>Glory</HI> of God from them, and unto their Everlasting <HI>Blessedness</HI> in Him. <HI>Amen.</HI></P>
