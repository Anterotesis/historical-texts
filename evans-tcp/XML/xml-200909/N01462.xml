<HEAD>THE Blessing and Honour OF Fruitful Mothers.</HEAD>
<EPIGRAPH>
<Q><BIBL>GENESIS xxxiii. 5.</BIBL>
<P><HI>And he lift up his Eyes and saw the Women and the Children, and said, Who are these with thee? And he said, The Children which God hath gra∣ciously given thy Servant.</HI></P></Q>
</EPIGRAPH>
<P>IN the beginning of this <HI>Chapter</HI> we have the Account of the <HI>Brotherly</HI> Affectionate Meeting of <HI>Jacob</HI> and <HI>Esau.</HI> It was a sin∣gular Proof of Gods <HI>Empire</HI> over the hearts of Men, and of His gracious <HI>Care</HI> of good Men and anfwering their Prayers. <HI>Jacob</HI> had been <HI>Wrestling</HI> in Prayer for this favour of Providence. His fears of his <HI>Brothers</HI> resent∣ments had been very Great. In his great Pru∣dence and Wisdom he had taken the most like∣ly measures to <HI>Soften</HI> his Brothers heart towards him. He sent his <HI>Presents</HI> before him, and now put his <HI>Wives</HI> and their <HI>Children</HI> into the most Moving Order that could be, and himself as the
<PB N="2" REF="001737_0005_0FB776CA75B6F230"/>head of them. <HI>Seven times</HI> he bowed himself to the Ground before his <HI>Brother;</HI> He did O∣beysance to him as his <HI>Elder</HI> Brother, and his Temporal <HI>Lord;</HI> He remembred also its very likely the <HI>Injury and Provocation</HI> he had on his part given tho' the thing was of God. This <HI>Humility</HI> and Respect of <HI>Jacob</HI> turn'd <HI>Esau</HI>'s heart within him, or rather <HI>GOD chang'd</HI> it in that Instant; and <HI>Esan ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his Neck and kissed him, and they both wept.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Natural Affection</HI> which had been so long <HI>Suppress'd,</HI> now returned in the <HI>Full Tyde</HI> thereof. How <HI>good is it</HI> to see <HI>Brethren</HI> that have been at Enmity so reconciled! <HI>A Brother offended is hard to be won.</HI> He that offends is hardly bro't to submit like <HI>Jacob.</HI> When God touches a Mans heart his Enmity to his Brother vanishes. When shall we see Brethren at distance meet again like these in our <HI>Context,</HI> and Emulate — I will not say the temper of Profane <HI>Esau,</HI> — that would be a reproach — but the humility and affection of good <HI>Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>THEY meet and say not a Word of their old differences: <HI>that</HI> would have soon broke the Peace again; had <HI>Esau</HI> remembred how <HI>Jacob</HI> had <HI>Supplanted</HI> him with a Lye, or <HI>Jacob</HI> re∣peated <HI>Esau</HI>'s threaning to <HI>Murder</HI> him. <Q>'Tis the <HI>Repeating</HI> a Matter that Separates Friends, and Perpetuates their Separation. A submissive Carriage will go a great way to conquer a very <HI>Esau</HI> and turn away Wrath. The Bullet flies over him that stoops:</Q> Sayes Mr. <HI>Henry.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="001737_0006_0FB776D63AA31008"/>
<HI>I'M afraid,</HI> tho' Charity obliges us to think the best; yet I'm <HI>afraid</HI> that <HI>Esan</HI>'s <HI>carnal tho'ts</HI> of the Birthright and of the Blessing helpt to preserve <HI>Jacob.</HI> He was born the <HI>Prince</HI> of the Family, and saw now <HI>that Birthright</HI> secure; <HI>Jacob</HI> with his Children lying at his Feet. This might help to make him <HI>Easie.</HI> His <HI>Arming</HI> and Contest might be for a <HI>Temporal Dominion;</HI> that's the <HI>Blessing</HI> that most People desire. The Case was the same as that in the beginning between <HI>Cain &amp; Abel;</HI>
<Q>and God told <HI>Cain</HI> that <HI>Abels</HI> Preference in the Divine Acceptance did no ways release him from the Duty and Respect which was owing from him as a <HI>Younger Brother: To thee shall be his desire, and thou shalt reign over him.</HI></Q> <HI>Jacob</HI> understood this well, and accordingly he did in Duty and Loyalty submit to <HI>my Lord Esau.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the thing was of <HI>God,</HI> who turns Mens Hearts by a Secret, Silent, Resistless Power, as He pleases. The <HI>Brethren both wept:</HI> how plea∣sant are the <HI>Tears of Joy</HI> after those of <HI>Anger, Grief and Fear?</HI> The Discord of Brethren oc∣casion the <HI>One,</HI> their Reconciliation the <HI>Other.</HI></P>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>TO come to our Text.</HEAD>
<P><HI>ESAU</HI> begins the kind Discourse, after they had Embrac'd and Wept a while. <HI>He lift up his Eyes and saw the Women and the Children, and said— Who are these with thee?</HI> How pleasant was it to <HI>them</HI> to see the Brothers meet so? In their Peace their <HI>Families</HI> had Peace and Safety. With what Joy came <HI>they</HI> forward to <HI>how themselves</HI> also.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="001737_0007_0FB776E60ADB8A80"/>
"<HI>JACOB</HI> had now Eleven or Twelve <HI>Little Ones</HI> in his Retinue, the Eldest of them not Fourteen Years Old. <HI>Esau</HI> had seen his <HI>Ser∣vants</HI> and the <HI>Droves</HI> before, but heard nothing of this <HI>Fair Troop</HI> and Flock. <HI>Who are these,</HI> sayes he?</P>
<P>TO this <HI>common Question Jacob</HI> return'd a very <HI>Serious Answer: They are the Children which God hath graciously,</HI> &amp;c. Observe in this <HI>Answer,</HI> the <HI>Devotion to God</HI> in it, and the <HI>Humility to Man.</HI></P>
<P N="1"><HI>1. THE Religion and Devotion toward God in it.</HI> This was as became <HI>Jacob,</HI> the Inheritor of the Spiritual Blessing. He spake <HI>after a Godly sort.</HI> The <HI>Holy Patriarchs</HI> most common Words and Actions were ordinarily thus framed.
<Q>He looks upon his <HI>Children,</HI> and speaks of them, (1.) As <HI>Gods Gift.</HI> (2.) The Choice Gifts of His <HI>Free Grace: which God has Graciously given me.</HI></Q> This is <HI>Speech seasoned with Grace,</HI> to <HI>minister</HI> Grace to others.</P>
<P N="2">2. THE <HI>Humility toward Man</HI> in this Answer: <HI>The Children which God has graciously given thy Ser∣vant.</HI> Under the Outward Favours of Provi∣dence we should be the more <HI>Meek and Lowly</HI> in Heart, in Words, in Behaviour. And <HI>Note,</HI> that such Forms of Speech among Men, are no <HI>vain Modes of Compliment. Jacob</HI> in a very serious manner sayes to his Brother, I am thy <HI>Servant.</HI> As <HI>Abraham</HI> before him was very <HI>Gentile</HI> in Be∣haviour, <HI>rising</HI> up and <HI>bowing</HI> to the <HI>Children of Heth:</HI> So <HI>Jacob</HI> that <HI>Plain and Good Man</HI> was very
<PB N="5" REF="001737_0008_0FB776E8771A23E0"/>Sincere in Professing himself ready to <HI>Serve</HI> his Brother. The better Children of <HI>God</HI> we are the more humble shall we be to <HI>Men;</HI> and the Servant of God is the readiest to become the Ser∣vant of all Men; 2 Cor. 4.5. <HI>Our selves your Ser∣vants for Jesus sake.</HI></P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 TYPE="part">
<HEAD>HAVING thus descanted on the Text; I would ask leave to make <HI>Three Observations</HI> from it.</HEAD>
<P N="1">[I.] That a Mother with a Train of Chil∣dren after her is One of the most admirable and lovely Sights in the Visible Creation of God. <HI>And Esau lift up his Eyes and saw the Women and the Children, and said who are these with thee.</HI></P>
<P N="2">[II.] That Children are among the Choice Fa∣vours and Gifts of Providence, and we should have a high Sense of the Gracious Favour of God to us in them. <HI>They are the Children which God has graciously given me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">[III.] Under the Outward Smiles of Provi∣dence on us and our Families, it well becomes us to be the more Humble, Meek and Lowly before God and Man. They are the Family which God has <HI>Graciously</HI> given <HI>thy Servant.</HI></P>
<DIV3 N="1" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>I. Obser. <HI>That a Mother with a Train of Children after her, is One of the most lovely and ad∣mirable Sights in the Visible Creation of God.</HI></HEAD>
<P>A very <HI>Superious</HI> Part of it in <HI>our Eyes</HI> to be sure, if we at all honour <HI>Our Selves.</HI> But because we may be <HI>Partial</HI> to our Selves, let us judge only by the Honour that God has put upon us.
<PB N="6" REF="001737_0009_0FB776E9FA811CA0"/>The Earth and all the Creatures in it were made for the Comfort, Service and Dominion of Man: Gen. 1.26. <HI>And God said, let us make Man in our Image, after our likeness, and let him have do∣minion over,</HI> &amp;c. <HI>So God Created Man in his own I∣mage, in the Image of God created He him, Male and Female created He them: And God blessed them, and God said unto them, be fruitful and multiply and re∣plenish the Earth and subdue it.</HI> It was the Ho∣nour of Man, and in Token of his Dignity and Pre-eminence above the other Creatures, that he was made <HI>Last;</HI> for the Method of the Cre∣ation was to advance from that which was least perfect to that which is more so; and thus Man the Lord of the lower World and the Image of the <HI>Creator</HI> in it was made the <HI>Crown</HI> of it; and as the Top-stone in the Noble Structure was bro't in with shouting; Grace, Grace unto it. The Flights of <HI>Birds</HI> in the Air are a fine and curious Spectacle, when they sometimes cloud and cover the Skies from our Eye: The Shoals of <HI>Fish</HI> in the Sea are a very admirable Sight, when now and then a few only of those Innu∣merable Inhabitants of the Waters shew them∣selves to the Eyes of Men. Again, the Flocks and Herds and Droves of <HI>Cattel;</HI> such as these which <HI>Jacob</HI> sent before him, the Lambs play∣ing about their careful bleating Dams, are a very beautiful sight on the Plains and Pastures where they feed: But how much more the <HI>Fa∣milies</HI> and <HI>Tribes</HI> of Men, We and our Children, the Flock of God that should be, <HI>the People of his Pasture and the Sheep of his hand.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="001737_0010_0FB776EB73A79A30"/>
<HI>MALE and Female Created He them; and blessed them, and said, be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth.</HI> Equal in this tho <HI>Women</HI> and the Men: for tho' <HI>Adam</HI> was first formed and then <HI>Eve,</HI> yet <HI>Both</HI> in the Image of God alike; <HI>Eve</HI> as well as <HI>Adam.</HI>
<Q>Angels were not made Male and Female, for they were not to Propagate their Kind. In the next World we shall be as the Angels which <HI>neither Marry,</HI> &amp;c.</Q> But Man an Earthly Creature, an <HI>Imbodied Angel,</HI> was
<Q>cre∣ated Male and Female that their Nature may be Propagated and the Race continued. Thus (sayes Mr. Henry) <HI>Fires and Candles,</HI> the Lu∣minaries of this lower World, because they waste and go out, have a power to <HI>Light</HI> more; but it is not so with the <HI>Lights of Heaven;</HI> Stars do not <HI>Kindle</HI> Stars.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN GOD had Created our <HI>First Parents,</HI> and Look'd upon them with Love and Pleasure then He Blessed them, with the Promise of a Numerous and Long Posterity. <HI>Be Fruitful and Multiply.</HI> This was the Honour of our first Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> that She was <HI>the Mother of all Living,</HI> Gen. 3.20. The Word <HI>Adam</HI> signifies <HI>Earth,</HI> Mans Original; but the Name <HI>Eve</HI> signifies <HI>Life,</HI> be∣cause by <HI>Her</HI> Life is Propagated to the many <HI>Generations</HI> that have been and are to come. "<HI>Adam</HI> bore the Name of the <HI>Dying Body, Eve</HI> of the <HI>Living Soul.</HI> It was because She was to be the <HI>Mother,</HI> that She was called <HI>Life.</HI> And doubtless it had respect to that <HI>Blessed Seed of "the Woman,</HI> the Redeemer, the <HI>Life of all the Living,</HI> the Author of <HI>Everlasting Life</HI> unto us.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="001737_0011_0FB776F461DAE2A8"/>
NOW the USE of this first <HI>Meditation</HI> might have been,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>TO Congratulate some of You whom God has blessed with very Amiable and Lovely Consorts, and a Numerous hopeful Family of Children. Hail</HI> you my highly favoured Friends! the Lord is with you, and blessed are you among Women; if to∣gether with this Outward favour of Provi∣dence you do but secure a <HI>Better Name</HI> than of Sons and Dau'ters; and be sure you are among the Children of God your Selves.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>IT should direct Christian Husbands how to prize, esteem and value such a Blessing of Providence; both the Mother and her Train.</HI> Rejoyce in the <HI>Good</HI> you have found, the <HI>Favour</HI> you have obtained of the Lord. Happy shalt thou be and it shall be well with thee; thy Wife a fruitful Vine by the sides of thy House; thy Children as Olive-branches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> May you live to see your Chil∣drens Children and Peace upon Israel. But it may be you will be too apt to <HI>Dote</HI> on the Creature and <HI>Idolize</HI> what you should only <HI>Love,</HI> and thank God for; It may be therefore need∣ful <HI>rather</HI> to insist on a <HI>Third Reflection.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. WHICH is of <HI>Caution and Restraint:</HI> And that,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>To Fruitful Parents, Not to be Proud of the Favours of Heaven to them.</HI> No; be humble yet; you neither <HI>Made</HI> your Selves Parents, nor can you be <HI>Sure</HI> of the Comfort you ought to hope for in your Children, nor can you say how long they shall <HI>Live</HI> to be your Honour or your Joy if they shall do well.</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="9" REF="001737_0012_0FB77701A32BEBE8"/>
2. LET it Caution <HI>Poorer Parents not to grow into Fears, Distrusts or Anxious Cares</HI> how to Pro∣vide for and subsist their <HI>Numerous Families.</HI> GOD that feeds the <HI>Ravens,</HI> will feed <HI>thine. These</HI> are thy Portion upon Earth, and many a Rich and Greater Nei'bour would give half his <HI>Estate</HI> and all his <HI>Honours</HI> for <HI>Half</HI> thy Family. <HI>Jacobs</HI> Fa∣mily were his distressing Care in this day, where∣in he owns them the gracious Gift and Favour of Providence to him.</P>
<P N="3">3. LET me add a <HI>Caution to the Barren; Not to be dejected for want of Children;</HI> as <HI>Rachel</HI> and poor <HI>Hannah</HI> were too much. For tho' it be such a favour to be the Mother of many, yet there are Greater favours than this to set our Hearts upon; and it may be you in your <HI>Espousals to Christ</HI> have much more to satisfie your Soul in; or at least <HI>thither</HI> let me direct you. Or indeed even our present Life <HI>Consists not</HI> in a Numerous Posterity; that we should say Sinfully and Ex∣treamly foolishly with <HI>Rachel, Give we Children or I dye.</HI> No; you may with <HI>Hannah</HI> Pray; but you must be Content if you are even denied; which <HI>She</HI> was not.</P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>THOSE of us that have but a Single Branch or Two,</HI> an <HI>only One</HI> (it may be) the <HI>Siender Hope</HI> and Prop of our House, must be very <HI>Thankful</HI> to God for the single <HI>Lamp</HI> in our House. If <HI>We</HI> were meet for more; as meet as our better Nei'bours, God would have given us more, it may be. Let humility preserve us, and let us be thankful for the least, when we <HI>deserve Nothing.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="001737_0013_0FB77703968D3568"/>
AND then in the <GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> Place,</P>
<P N="5">5. A Word to <HI>them that have had many but have buried all:</HI> Our <HI>Mournful Mothers</HI> that have <HI>Sorrow upon Sorrow,</HI> those of <HI>Burying</HI> upon those of <HI>Bearing;</HI> Be comforted in the Hopes of the Children you have <HI>in Heaven, in Glory;</HI> gathered into the <HI>Saviours Arms</HI> and laid in His <HI>Bosom. Suffer</HI> your <HI>Little Ones</HI> to go to Him; He'll take them up and bless them; as He has said of them — That of such is the Kingdom of Heaven. <HI>Believe it,</HI> (where is your Faith? And O thou of little, wherefore dost thou Weep? believe it). That it is <HI>well worth the Sorrows and Pains</HI> of bearing and of burying too, <HI>to have a Child in Heaven:</HI> While so many have their Families Growing up and Branching out, of whom God only knows what they will be and prove in this Evil World.</P>
<P>BUT so I dismiss my <HI>First Observation;</HI> That a Mother with a Train of Children after her is One of the most Lovely Sights in the Visible Creation of GOD.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="2" TYPE="observation">
<HEAD>II. Obser. THE <HI>Second Observation</HI> which I would make is; <HI>That Children are among the Choice Favours and Gifts of Providence, and we should have a high Sense of the gracious Regards of GOD unto us herein.</HI></HEAD>
<P>They are the Children which God has graci∣ously given me.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="11" REF="001737_0014_0FB777052D67A840"/>
I. <HI>THEY are among the Choice Favours and Gifts of Providence to a Person.</HI> Let <HI>Nature</HI> decide this; Or if <HI>that</HI> in its present Affections and Judgment is apt to err, let the <HI>Scripture</HI> determine it: Psal. 127.3. <HI>Lo, Children are an Heritage, and the fruit of the Womb is his Reward.</HI> They are their Parents best Inheritance, and the Gift of Free Grace. Psal. 113.9. <HI>He maketh the barren Woman to keep house, and to be a joyful Mother of Children; praise ye the Lord.</HI> Psal. 107.41. <HI>He setteth the Poor on High from Affliction, and maketh him Families like a Flock.</HI> To be sure if <HI>Providence</HI> concerns it¦self in any thing here below, it is in the Matters of our <HI>Life and Death; Who, How many</HI> shall be born into the World, and <HI>Where</HI> and by <HI>Whom,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>YET Children are by no Means to be put a∣mong or equal'd to the <HI>Saving Gifts</HI> of Gods Grace. There is a better Name than of Sons and Dau'ters. A Numerous Posterity is the Portion of many a <HI>Wicked Person.</HI> Psal. 17.14, 15. <HI>They are full of Children, and leave their Substance to their Babes; as for me I will behold thy face in Righteousness,</HI> &amp;c. Nevertheless Children are a very Gracious <HI>Gift</HI> of God to us in this Life. They are so,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>IN the Formation of them in the Womb.</HI> For who knoweth the way of the Spirit, or how the bones do grow within Her that is with Child? It is not at all owing to the Parents care that there is a perfect Child formed, and quickened by a Living Soul. God that formed Adams Body out of the Ground, forms our Bodies in
<PB N="14" REF="001737_0015_0FB777068FD31A08"/>are their <HI>Names</HI> for ever in the Church on that Account! But could Pious <HI>Hannah or Ruth</HI> receive their Sons without their Solemn Offerings of Praises to God? No: Ruth 4.14. <HI>And the Women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the Lord which has not left thee this day without a Name in Israel: and Naomi took the Child and laid it in her Bosom.</HI> Read also <HI>Hannah:</HI> transport of Devotion at the Dedication of her <HI>Little Nazarite,</HI> and Her <HI>Song:</HI> 1 Sam. 2. Chap.</P>
<P N="3">3. IF Children are Gods Gift to us, <HI>Then they should be given to God again:</HI> Dedicated to Him as His Propriety and Resigned to His disposal; to be bro't up for Him, and to Live to Him and Serve Him for ever. So <HI>Abraham</HI> Circumcis'd his <HI>Isaac,</HI> and <HI>Hannah</HI> devoted her <HI>Samuel,</HI> and we in <HI>Baptism Consecrate our Children unto CHRIST.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>CHILDREN should remember themselves to be the LORD's, and their Bonds to Live to Him.</HI> God gave thee thy Being and thy Life; and gave thee to thy Parents who have given thee back to Him again. Be <HI>His,</HI> My <HI>Child;</HI> and so Gods gracious Gift to <HI>Us,</HI> and <HI>Ours</HI> and thine <HI>Own</HI> to Him again.</P>
<P N="5">5. IF Children are the gracious Gift of God, then it is <HI>Lawful and a Duty to Mourn under the Holy and Awful hand of God in their Death; or in their Sinful Courses</HI> which may be worse than Death. Sorrow is Natural, and may be Gracious in such Cases; but it must be in Moderation
<PB N="15" REF="001737_0016_0FB7770B671347D8"/>and with Resignation. Even <HI>Jacob</HI> himself was an Intemperate Mourner for <HI>Joseph;</HI> and bitter was his Grief and deep his Shame when some others of his <HI>Sons</HI> stain'd their hands with blood, shed treacherously and cuelly. Our <HI>Dead</HI> Sor∣rows are often very heavy ones; like the shrieks at <HI>Rama, Rachel</HI> Mourning for her Children, not to be Comforted. But our <HI>Living</HI> Sorrows may be <HI>heavier</HI> far, as well as more <HI>Lasting:</HI> Prov. 10.1. <HI>A wise Son maketh a glad Father, but a foolish Son is the heaviness of his Mother.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the <HI>First Thing</HI> under the <HI>Second Ob∣servation;</HI> That Children are among the Special Favours and Gifts of Providence.</P>
<P N="2">II. <HI>WE ought to have a high Sense of the Grace of God expressed towards us in the hopeful Children which He gives us.</HI> They are <HI>Graciously</HI> given to us. The Gift of free Grace; without and against our deserts.</P>
<P>THEY are a Visible and Sensible Expression of the Divine Favour to us. So we read, 1 <HI>Chron.</HI> 26.5. That <HI>Obed-Edom had Eight Sons, for God blessed him.</HI> Many Children are the Divine Blessing on a Family.</P>
<P>THEY are a great <HI>Pleasure and Delight</HI> to Parents: an <HI>Honour and Reputation</HI> also among Men; and a Safe-guard and <HI>Protection</HI> to us as they grow up. Psal. 127.4, 5. <HI>As arrows are in the hand of a mighty Man, so are Children of the Youth. Happy is the man that hath his quiver
<PB N="16" REF="001737_0017_0FB7770CAA108E00"/>full of them: — they shall speak with the Enemies in the gate.</HI> Good Children are so many faithful <HI>"Zealous Seconds</HI> to their Parents, in the vigour of their Youth to stand up in Their defence, when They are Injuriously run down in Age. <HI>"As arrows in the hand of a Mi'ty man,</HI> who knows how to use them for his own safety, <HI>And as a giver full of them;</HI> so is his <HI><GAP DESC="illegible" REASON="indecipherable" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/></HI> suppli'd, and under the favour of Providence <HI>abides in strength.</HI></P>
<P>CHILDREN are more than <HI>Riches:</HI> they are the <HI>Heirs</HI> of it: and which is, Greater, the Earth or its <HI>Owners?</HI> Moreover, we may and ought to hope well concerning our Children with respect to the <HI>Spiritual and Everlasting Bles∣sings of the Life to come.</HI> As <HI>Jacob</HI> here look'd upon <HI>his Children</HI> as Graciously given him be∣cause they were <HI>Heirs of the Covenant Blessing;</HI> they were to build up the Church of God, and be the <HI>Patriarchs,</HI> the Fathers of the People of God. He <HI>Hop'd</HI> too that they were or would be Gracious, that they did belong to the <HI>Election of Grace;</HI> and so were Heirs of Everlasting Life.</P>
<P>IN a Word; the <HI>least Token</HI> of Gods favour is <HI>free Grace</HI> to a Sinful Creature. Our <HI>Sins</HI> daily forfeit our best Mercies, and might for ever keep good things from us. It is of Gods Free, and Rich, and Sovereign Grace that He does not <HI>call our Sins to Remembrance</HI> so as to <HI>Slay our "Children.</HI> When God <HI>Removes</HI> our Comforts He <HI>Remembers</HI> our Sins; while He continues them to us He graciously <HI>Overlooks</HI> our Sinfulness: <HI>i. e.</HI> This is the Face and Language of His Providence:</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="001737_0018_0FB77719BB110C48"/>
TO <HI>Improve this Head</HI> a little.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>PARENTS take Pleasure in your Children, be very Tender of them, and look on 'em alwayes with Complacency and Esteem.</HI> A very needless <HI>Exhor∣tation</HI> you may be ready to think; for alas Parents are ready to be but <HI>too fond</HI> of their Offspring. But however, Love them and Delight in them they ought; and may not be without <HI>Natural Affection,</HI> which were to be <HI>worse than Insidels.</HI> Let us receive our Children with great Pleasure from the Hand of God; Study their Interests, and Promote them, Temporal and Eternal.</P>
<P>Yet,</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>BEWARE of Inordinate Love.</HI> Do not give them thy heart. Make 'em not <HI>Idols.</HI> And don't Love 'em to death; by provoking God to <HI>Jea∣lousy</HI> by giving that Love to any Creature which is due to Him alone. Love them in <HI>O∣bedience</HI> to God, and as <HI>His</HI> more than thine. Mat. 10.37. <HI>He that loveth Son or Dau'ter more than Me is not worthy of Me.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. CARRY and <HI>behave thy self graciously</HI> under this favour of Providence; if God has filled, or is filling thy House with Children.</P>
<P>AND therefore,</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>BE the more Devoted to God thy Self, every Child He gives thee.</HI> Renew then the Consecration of thy Self, and thy Covenant Engagements to the Lord: it is a very <HI>Proper season to do it Solemnly.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="18" REF="001737_0019_0FB7771AC2B150D8"/>
2. <HI>INSTRUCT and Educate well</HI> the Children that God gives thee. Bring them up for Him; in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord; this is the <HI>Grateful Offering</HI> which He requires.</P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>PRAY much for them, and Over them, and Charge them</HI> to Know the God of their Fathers, &amp; to Serve Him with a Perfect Heart and Willing Mind, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Pray with <HI>Abraham, O that Ishmael may live in thy Sight!</HI> Bless them as <HI>Isaac</HI> and <HI>Israel</HI> did. And Charge them as <HI>David</HI> did <HI>Solomon;</HI> and as his <HI>Mother</HI> too did; <HI>What my Son, and what the Son of my Womb? and what the Son of my Vows?</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>BE not Proud or Elated on this Account be∣fore Men;</HI> if God blesses thee with Children and builds up thy Family. Do not despise the Nei'bour who is not blessed in this Instance as you are. <HI>Hagar</HI> had no sooner Conceived, but <HI>Sarah</HI> her Mistress was <HI>despised</HI> in her Eyes. <HI>Hannahs</HI> Enemy vexed her because she was bar∣ren. <HI>Leah</HI> gloried over poor <HI>fretful Rachel;</HI> having so many <HI>Sons</HI> to show and her <HI>Sister</HI> none. Alas, <HI>tho' Childrens Children are the Crown of Old Men,</HI> yet are they nothing to be Proud of; for who knows but they may be our <HI>grief</HI> and our <HI>shame;</HI> as very often the <HI>Idoliz'd Child</HI> proves? Or how soon may the most fruitful Parents, that have Families like a Flock, be <HI>Written Childless?</HI></P>
<P>BUT I <HI>seem to forget</HI> that I am <HI>run</HI> into the <HI>Third Observation</HI> Propounded from the <HI>Text,</HI> and which I would but Name.</P>

<HEAD>III. Obser. <HI>THAT under the Outward Smiles of Providence on us and our Families, it well becomes us to be the more Humble, Meek and Lowly before God and Man.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THEY are the Children which God has given <HI>thy Servant.</HI> It may be <HI>Esau</HI> had not then so fair a <HI>Troop</HI> to show; yet <HI>they with their Father were Esau's humble Servants.</HI> Together they were ready to <HI>Prostrate</HI> and lye at his feet. <HI>Humility</HI> is a lovely Grace and Vertue in the sight of God and Man. It charms down Pride and Wrath together. And its beauty is Greatest under the Smiles of Providence. It is the <HI>Or∣nament of the Soul</HI> that is of Great price in Gods Eyes, and as it exalts the Soul in His Sight, so it procures Exaltation in the King∣dom both of Providence and Grace. <HI>He that humbleth himself shall be Exalted. He giveth Grace to the lowly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>BE ye clothed with Humility:</HI> sayes the <HI>Apostle,</HI> 1 Pet. 5.5. This is our <HI>glorious but decent</HI> Ar∣ray whether we be in Prosperity or Adversity-Without it the <HI>Nakedness</HI> of the Soul is dis∣covered, and its <HI>Shame</HI> is seen.</P>
<P>WHAT is there on Earth, I beseech you, to be <HI>Vain or Proud of?</HI> What in a corrupt and dying <HI>World!</HI> Or if we so vainly abuse any Enjoyment, and fall into the Condemnation of the Devil, how sadly do we forfeit it?</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="001737_0021_0FB7772BE28376E8"/>
SOME under the visible favours of Providence grow vain and hau'ty, and forget their <HI>Rise,</HI> that they are like others <HI>of the dust,</HI> and turning apace to it again, that they or their Fathers were <HI>Poor and low once</HI> in outward State, and in this uncertain World may suddenly <HI>be so again:</HI> The Upstart and Mean Spirit is ready to forget the Rock whence he was hewn, and to scorn and upbraid the Poor, the Needy and the Afflicted. But not so Good <HI>Jacob,</HI> who looking over his Servants and his Flocks, and his Children cried out; <HI>O God of my Fathers, I am not worthy of the least of all the Mercies, and of all the Truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy Servant; for with my Staff I passed over this Jordan, and now I am become two Bands. Job</HI> also in his Prosperity and in the Months when God preserv'd him; when the Candle of the Lord shined on his Head and by His light he walked thro' darkness; while his <HI>Children were about him,</HI> and he washed his steps in butter, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Even then he did <HI>not despise the Canse of his Servant,</HI> but remembred; — <HI>He that made Him in the Womb made me, and One God fashioned us both.</HI></P>
<P>O 'tis a little and <HI>Mean Vice,</HI> but of <HI>Great Guilt,</HI> to swell upon a few Worldly Advan∣tages, and bear our selves above Others on that Account; the <HI>King of Israel</HI> remembred humbly his <HI>Original</HI> and said before God, <HI>Lord who am I and what is my Fathers house that thou hast bro't me hitherto! and that thou shouldest speak of the House of thy Servant for a great while to come!</HI></P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="001737_0022_0FB7772D82F28828"/>
WHEN <HI>Jacob</HI> Pointed to his Children, and Spake of them to <HI>Esau</HI> with so much <HI>Humility;</HI> think not that he <HI>Complemented</HI> his Brother, in calling himself <HI>His Servant:</HI> No, that <HI>Patriar∣chal Age</HI> was full of <HI>Simplicity</HI> as well as <HI>Courtesie:</HI> He spake the Words of <HI>Truth and Soberness;</HI> his <HI>Heart</HI> went with his <HI>Lips;</HI> He Spake as he <HI>tho't</HI> and as <HI>he felt;</HI> the Inward Sense of his Soul; and as became an <HI>Inferior</HI> in Outward <HI>State,</HI> and Natural <HI>Relation.</HI> He was ready and inclined to <HI>Serve</HI> him. His <HI>Fears</HI> were Great, but he had the <HI>real Love of a Bro∣ther,</HI> and the <HI>Respect of a Junior.</HI> And just now he was especially <HI>Oblig'd by Esau's Kindness,</HI> and full of <HI>Gratitude</HI> both to GOD and Him.</P>
<P>TO <HI>Conclude,</HI> We should <HI>least of all be Proud of our Children,</HI> because our <HI>Saviour</HI> has made a <HI>Little Child the Emblem of Humility</HI> to us. Mat. 18.2, 3. <HI>He took a little Child and set in the midst of his Disciples, and said to them, Whosoever shall humble himself as this Little Child, the same is Greatest in the Kingdom of God: And except ye be Converted and become as Little Children ye add in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</HI> It seems then that <HI>Converting Grace</HI> make us as <HI>Little Children.</HI> As One sayes,
<Q>Not <HI>Foolish</HI> as Children, nor <HI>Fickle,</HI> nor
<NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>See Mr. Newy in Lac.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Playful;</HI> but as Children ready to <HI>Learn,</HI> and desirous of the <HI>Sincere Milk of the Word;</HI> as Children <HI>Careful for Nothing</HI> but <HI>Depending</HI> on the Care of our Heavenly Father; As Children <HI>Harm∣less</HI>
<PB N="22" REF="001737_0023_0FB7772F23951D98"/>and Inoffensive and void of Malice. As Children. <HI>Governable</HI> and under Command; and finally, as Children <HI>Humble</HI> and not taking <HI>State</HI> upon them. As they are <HI>Little in Body and Low in Stature;</HI> so Christians should be <HI>Low in Spirit and Little in their own Tho'ts.</HI></Q> It would therefore be a most <HI>absurd</HI> thing for us to be Proud of our Children, when Christ has made them the sign of <HI>Humility</HI> to us. We are to look on them and learn <HI>Humility.</HI></P>
<P>HAPPY the Man that can Say and Sing <HI>Davids</HI> Psalm and Profession of Humility, <HI>Psal.</HI> 131.</P>
<P>UNDER the <HI>Favours</HI> of Providence our <HI>Heart should not be hau'ty nor our Eyes loftly;</HI> we must neither court our own Shadow, nor envy nor despise Others; And under the <HI>Frowns of Pro∣vidence, Surely we must behave, and quiet our selves as a weaned Child.</HI></P>
<P><Q>THE Child at the Age of <HI>Weaning</HI> is not come to the <HI>Acting of Pride;</HI> or the Child may <HI>take on at first</HI> when it is Weaned from the Breast; but when <HI>Once weaned it grows quiet.</HI></Q> So Sanctifying Grace weans us from Worldly things, and <HI>Quiets</HI> us in the <HI>Possession</HI> or in the <HI>Loss</HI> of them. We must Learn to
<Q>Live upon God and the <HI>Covenant of Grace,</HI> when Creatures prove <HI>Dry Breasts</HI> to us; or when Providence <HI>puts Wormwood</HI> on the Breast to Wean us from it.</Q></P>
