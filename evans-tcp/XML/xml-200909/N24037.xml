</EPIGRAPH>
<P>TO promote this lovely sentiment, and to provide its richest blessings, men in all ages, have formed various associations. Among these, is the <HI>Order of Free Masons,</HI> which we this day honor by our public solemnities, and by the consecration of a Lodge, and its Officers, agreeably to this benev∣olent institution.</P>
<P>THOUGH Masonry, in its priciples, be venera∣ble in the most antient traditions, yet its form must
<PB N="6" REF="031798_0005_0FEE72313141F858"/>have been improved, by the progress of the human understanding. It rose not a perfect building: It combined its grand proportions, as the arts ad∣vanced towards perfection. It had a new aera, at the building of the T'emple, and must have seen new glory in the ages of christianity, when Gre∣cian triumphed over Gothic structures. From our present improvement, it becomes a pertinent enquiry, how our institution received its last forms from the light which shone upon Europe. It has been pretended, that it was aided by the Cru∣isades, when Europe engaged in destructive ad∣ventures, formed an object for its ambition in religious enthusiasm. Such enthusiasts from va∣rious nations might require some associating prin∣ciple, and originate some band of union. But this principle would be as far from science, as was the design of their adventures. It would spring out of their enthusiasm, and bear the strongest marks of a design to assist the cause in which they engag∣ed. It would be as public as their design, and as memorable as its consequences. They would think, not of Architecture, but of the March and the Camp; not of Geometry, but of the Cross. But the red Cross in the Banner is unknown to us, and our signal is not for victory. The age of chivalry has no better claim. It is unknown in our emblems, and prevailed in a country, we have
<PB N="7" REF="031798_0006_0FEE7234064A3EA8"/>least visited. Our last history has nothing con∣nected with Grecian mysteries, or common with the Mystics. Though allied to the antient man∣ners of the north, it attended not in silence upon the circles of the Druids, where the science of the square never appeared. We look elsewhere for its present form. And we follow with cau∣tious steps, its progress from the east. The old Chronicles attest, that early associations existed in the northern regions, and that these fraternities, of which the nobility <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mallet.</NOTE> were members, long pre∣served their primitive form. Upon the reception of christianity, they welcomed the doctrines and arts, which accompanied it. Their silence, their elections, their members, their monumental stones, concur to explain our progress. The concise Tacitus will give us many lines for comparison. Even in Iceland, we see the five magistrates, the or∣dinary and extraordinary meetings, the members, who were freemen, the assemblies at the solstices, the pure manners, the submission, the songs, and the fund for the distressed, even before the use of writ∣ten laws. Part of the pay was feasting, <NOTE N="†" PLACE="foot">Tacitus.</NOTE> and at these feasts, their obligations were renewed. In the northern regions these Lodges are yet to be seen, and the monumental columns, and <NOTE N="‡" PLACE="foot">Cordiner's Scenery of the North, 1780.</NOTE> Torfeus will
<PB N="8" REF="031798_0007_0FEE723800213400"/>inform us of the first artist, and of the contribu∣tions of Europe, to which we are indebted for the noble structures of the tenth century. To be known abroad the Christian Architects encour∣aged our institution. The Keledci, or Emissaries of the sacred colleges employed it, as concurring with the best manners of their converts. The Runie character is still imitated upon our records, as the first introduced into that part of Europe, from which we descended. Christian have unit∣ed with antient emblems, that we might honor the best institutions and partake of them, while we forget not our origin, or our antiquity, Our re∣turn to light is Christian, but our fellowship is more antient. The Lodge is finely situate on the shore, while the retreating tide tells the Brother <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> was caught at the <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> of the sea.</NOTE> upon his first landing of the danger of perfidy and guilt. The Acacia is opposed to the Missel∣toe, and the body of Balder is not forgotten. The paintings shewn to the apprentice are of the original kind. The higher grades have been conjoined with lessons from the schools of Greece, and more modern inventions. Each image is simple in the first order, and the progress is seen as we rise. Hence we find as the antient order travelled southward in Britain, after the conquest
<PB N="9" REF="031798_0008_0FEE72398894CED0"/>of the Danes, that the York Lodge claims high∣est antiquity, and united the simplicity of the north, with the gay freedom of a more southern sky. Builders then came from all nations, and this stately Fabric on its first foundations stands firm and glorious.</P>
<P>LET us examine this spacious habitation. A Lodge is not the abode of one solitary family. It bars not its doors in the storm, and dreads not to give the assistance of the night. It has its build∣ings erected on the most desert path of life, and they stand open to receive every fatigued and be∣nightened Brother. It is one, because one soul inhabits all its regions. A Brother is at home wherever a Brother dwells. We have seen the worthy; who have had many an honor, come and expire calmly in our arms. We dropped the Acacia into the tomb, and have seen them slumber in peace. We have given the kind salutation to the hostile sons of Afric's once delightful shore. They have eaten of our bread, and have tasted of our wine, with which they have been refreshed. We have seen Brethren retreating from the cruel∣ty of blood, partaking of our joys. These kind offices have extended our thoughts to generous love. We have searched for, and we have found, from different nations, the same friends of mankind.
<PB N="10" REF="031798_0009_0FEE723B12AAABD8"/>How useful would be a true history of Mason∣ry! The Saints have their Books of Martyrs. The gay world, their novels for amusement. Na∣tions have their history. Might not Masonry, through the State find a subject worthy of the friend of mankind? To see the hospitable lodges distrib∣uted around the enlightened world, and to travel in one evening of meditation through all the Lodges on the globe. We trust that our rising order will not long be deprived of this invaluable pleasure. To adorn a quiet seat may be our delight; but to enter with the sentiment, that we belong to the world of friendship and life, must give the highest glory to the character of man.</P>
<P>THEN shall we assemble the hospitable virtues from all nations. The eastern traveller shall tell his tale, enlivened by fancy and by hope, to awak∣en every kind attachment, and to command in∣stant and cheerful relief to sorrow. The ready oil, not less pure than the Samaritan's, shall be poured by the injected thought of kindness, with∣out one fear to check it as it freely flows. Then, as in the hardy north, the good man shall feast at his open door, and invite each longing appetite to come and be satisfied. Then shall the kind peasant rise to survey the dangers of the path and the mountain, while the inhabitant of the shore
<PB N="11" REF="031798_0010_0FEE723F245D8A30"/>shall awake from his midnight slumbers, least dis∣tress should call in vain. Sweet confidence shall then dwell in the breast of man, and cheerfulness discover, how he reposes on the lap of friendship. Who can forget the importunity of old Abraham with the stranger! What has civil life done to ad∣vance the pleasure of this invitation! In these forms shall we learn to love. They display the lovely attractions of simplicity, native innocence, and ready sympathy, the purest virtues of the heart.</P>
<P>WHAT will then be our enquiries? Who knocks now at the Lodge? Who has been wel∣comed and blessed? What cares disturb a weary Brother, and whence can he have relief? Where does his light shine, and is it bright? Are his seet ready at the door for offices of love? Does he come hand in hand with the brethren? Is his heart free to conceive, and his hand ready to bestow? How many days in each month has he recorded on his heart the kindness done to a Bro∣ther, to renew it? In how many nights has he giv∣en light to the path of a stranger? Can he say to a Brother, Let me see thy countenance, and let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance delights me.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="031798_0011_0FEE7241EB5AEC38"/>
BUT when is the heart of man most open? It is then, we will embrace and enjoy him.</P>
<P>AND are we not all agreed, that man is only seen in his friendly dispositions, when the soul is cheer∣ful. Then all the causes, which concur to shut the heart, are least felt. Cheerfulness is required in every state of innocence and love. The testi∣mony of mankind is ready. How abundant are examples in the scriptures of all antiquity. How emblematical the wine, which cheers the heart, and how strong the pictures of a Mahomedan, and of every heaven! Cheerfulness was re∣proached in Jesus, but beloved by him, because it may correct every vice, and corrupts no principle of virtue. See it, when it accompanies life's bles∣sings. It is the same health of the mind as a good organization is of the body. Then the under∣standing dwells in a clear sky, and the affections, like the pure streams of life, have a divine light to invigorate them. Not all the wisdom of man, not all the motives of his happiness can exalt him like the heart thus free to enjoy the affections brought pure into his soul. The man, cheerful at his la∣bour, never forsakes it. Cheerful in his domestic affections, he never wanders from his home. All nature spreads her charms before him. Do you see the intemperate man. He is flying from the cares
<PB N="13" REF="031798_0012_0FEE7244C1F042F8"/>and duties of his life. He is not in love with himself and the world. Does he shun domestic life, his soul is not in peace. Does he solicit di∣version for his thoughts, serene pleasure will never bring him virtue and happiness. Take the good apprentice, and it is the cheerful youth, ready for every duty of his calling. Take the good husband, and his heart is clear as the light, and cheerful as the day. The countenance of the good citizen warms wherever it shines. The public spirited man is cheerful when blessings multiply around him.</P>
<P>BUT cheerfulness is not spontaneous in the heart; else why should so many gloomy counte∣nances, never cleared, offer to our sight? Why so many imaginary cares, to produce endless disquiets, and to conjure misery from the dead? Why is man so easily disturbed?</P>
<P>WE must then plant and cultivate the virtue, where the purest sympathies may nourish it; where the sun of benevolence may daily cheer it, and where generous spirits may refresh it. Then it will gather strength in habit, and stand firm against every blast by its own power.</P>
<P>IN MASONRY, we cultivate this virtue in the best manner, by removing from every thing which
<PB N="14" REF="031798_0013_0FEE724785015388"/>confines the heart. Do competitions in life raise the angry storm;—here the breezes refresh from general and diffusive hope. Does the sad counte∣nance alarm by sympathy;—here it flies, like the white cloud above us, wasting in aether. Do reli∣gious fears straighten the breast, and heave a sigh, as in the dull air of a misty morning;—here the sun rises, soon to scatter them, and all the air is in love. Do angry passions hang, like the storm, up∣on the heart of man;—here they are driven away by the breath of charity. Do parties thunder like the meeting clouds, and waste their lightning on the guiltless;—here is the serene air, and the bright horizon of peace. Do fears, like the gale, rise adverse to our hopes;—soon we quit our dan∣gers, and take the gale free in the ocean of be∣nevolence. Does disturbed joy, like the gust, for a moment defy our skill;—we soon reach the winds which bend their constant summer course towards the regions where are balsamic flowers, rich spices, and the land of plenty.</P>
<P>COME Cheerfulness, and find a seat with us. The tales of Asia, and the borrowed romance of Europe, know thee not so well as we. No, not the man of nature, hovering over a winter's fire, to tell his gay loves, and to forget the storm in friendship and in glee. We will make thee wel∣come.
<PB N="15" REF="031798_0014_0FEE724B86718558"/>We will open our hearts to thee. We fly not our cares. We only seat ourselves here, to return with greater delight. We meet from every circle of active life, in one grand circle of love. But it is, to carry home the rich provision with which thou canst fill us, till we meet again. We leave the world behind not to hate it, but to as∣semble all thy blessings into our bosoms, and to go abroad and scatter them. The friend of our dear∣est love shall confess, that we transplant all thy fa∣vour to be enriched in her bosom. Cheerful∣ness, come and sit with us. Here is love waiting to be cheered by thee. Here all the graces shall attend thee. Joy shall enkindle at thy counte∣nance, and laughter be ready at thy call. Social glee shall sport without guilt, and instruction steal with kind insinuation into every heart. Charity shall tell her deeds to learn to multiply them, and Sympathy shall repeat them, mirth shall be gay, and the song shall enrapture the ear, while the thought on which it lives goes welcome to the heart, to dwell there forever. Where canst thou find better friends? Where canst thou inspire purer joys? Enchanted, we will hold thee, and never separate from thee. Whither thou goest, we will go. Thou mayst visit other friends, but here shall be thy habitation.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="031798_0015_0FEE724D0FF2F260"/>
LET us now enquire, how the MASON is prepar∣ed for the greatest virtue of the heart, and the exalted duties of an enlightened understanding. Should he not discover his qualifications for the highest character, let him renounce the honor of his name. We expect that he will be among the MOST GENEROUS OF MEN,—among the most EN∣LIGHTENED IN SOCIETY,—and among the most CHARITABLE IN RELIGION. This is the charac∣ter he claims, and this, it is his ambition to deserve. To become the most generous of men, when a Mason leaves his Lodge, he reflects—I have pledged my love, and promised every kind ser∣vice to my brethren of every name. How shall I perform my obligation? Can I have a just expec∣tation, that my virtues will be more pure, because I have breathed a freer air than belongs to the crowded habitations of men? Can I then at once return to the contagion of impure regions, and will the past draught then nourish me? Shall not my every thought in life be free as in the Lodge, and corrupt by no vile affection? It is not a short visit to the happiest clime, which enables us fore∣ver to inhale the best sweets of life. It is the resi∣dence in these purer skies. Each duty then re∣tains its fragrance, and the strength is recruited at every hour. A Mason may change his place, but not his heart. He lives in love, and when he
<PB N="17" REF="031798_0016_0FEE724FE291DE68"/>dies, love fits on his lips, and speaks the last lan∣guage of his soul.</P>
<P>In society the Mason maintains his dignity. He has seen competition lost, in kind discourse and mutual endearment. He has often seen the gay freedom of one nation, enliven the sedate and pensive countenance of another. The ma∣jesty of one nation has yielded to the insinuating manners of another. The business of the mer∣chant, and the industry of the husbandman have not made them insensible to the good humor of the gay. The professed friends of science have not forgotten to mingle with mankind. And having like so many streams united, they have more bountifully supplied life, with wisdom and happiness. He has seen man, as he is, when di∣vested of all his fondest habits, his dearest self, and when separated from the partial views of pri∣vate interest. And the character of man is so much the same, that he is sure of the true image of the family, and that one nature belongs to them. He lives then as under common wants, and as capable of relief from the same virtues. All may have the countenance of love, and he studies to bring the kindest glances upon himself. He asks only what he is ready to give, and if refused, refuses not again. Noble life this! Here we fill
<PB N="18" REF="031798_0017_0FEE7252A539F7E0"/>our cup of blessedness. It inspires by the freest draught, and by its fullness, we are made divine.</P>
<P>BUT what rites consecrate this interwiew of the blessed? The priest looks for his mitre in vain. The altar is a pure heart, and the wise man is a friend. The Mahomedan has left his robes, and enters in peace, and the Christian displays not his cross. Religion is reverenced in silence, and man appears in the virtues of the heart, beloved for the possession of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 letter" DISP="•"/>ergion, as his greatest good, and most ample recommendation. Virtue takes its value not from names, or the opinions with which it is associated, but from the blessings it brings. The greatest offering is social duty, and the richest possession is love. Thus free, how happy is man. With himself to choose; but with the world to love goodness, wherever it can be found.</P>
<P>BUT we are to remember that we are friends of an institution, and that we are to commend it not only as pure in its principles, but as supported by peculiar duties, which we owe to it.</P>
<P>TO enter a Lodge does not make a man a Ma∣son, more than to enter a Church makes him a Saint. He has his duties there, sacred as his happiness, and perpetual as his hopes.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="031798_0018_0FEE725573BEDF38"/>
IT is then apparent, that every man cannot be a fit subject of its honors. A slave to prejudice, he cannot be enlightened by truth: Unable to separate the social character from the religious opinion, he is not capable of philanthropy: Des∣titute of an ingenuous mind in private life, he can∣not exercise a rational and universal benevolence.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that a Brother owes also his full concurrence in the liberal purposes of his Breth∣ren. By a constant attention he gives his person∣al virtues to the Lodge. Absent, he withdraws his best influence from the institution.</P>
<P>A Brother also cannot be lost in a circle of private friends. We might as well sit near our fires, and detail stories about London and Paris, and call ourselves merchants of those cities, as to have no correspondence with the great world of Masons in our Grand Lodges.</P>
<P>A Brother cannot forget the importance of E∣lections, and the judgment to be employed in them. The Officers are the soul of the Lodge, and they impart their own character to it. If they are active, constant and charitable, the Lodge will imitate them. If they fail of their duty, the best hopes are lost. They will therefore be en∣couraged
<PB N="20" REF="031798_0019_0FEE72598563CE78"/>by the greatest respect. Good Officers will create this respect, but worthy members may establish it. Doubtless in attention to appearan∣ces in the world, we may covet to see men in of∣fice, who have corresponding offices in civil life. This is a great advantage, but no love of rank should incur any hazard of the neglect of the du∣ty of any appointment. This would be a pride fatal to our Lodge, and contemptible in the mean∣est associations. To be fine abroad, and poor at home, has not even decency to recommend it. It is useful to remember the danger, and never to forget, That the best Master should be always the best Mason.</P>
<P>A Brother should consider also, how much his personal virtues assist an <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> order to which he be∣longs. The public honors come with double pleasure to us, when we are told, that he who has deserved them, is a Brother. And the great Pat∣ron of the Lodges of Massachusetts is recollected with this pleasure. When we behold the mon∣ument, which stands high upon his grave near their Capital, we remember that it is sacred to a Mason. The friends of WASHINGTON know him in this character. An enthusiasm to give our order sup∣port from our personal character, is the most gen∣erous we can entertain.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="031798_0020_0FEE725B0F706C50"/>
A TRUE Brother will also be attentive to the endearments of life, and be the greatest friend to the companion of man. The sympathy of wo∣man is the bliss of man. But though equal in her rights, she depends on the generous goodness of man, for her best hopes. She depends on man, for the opinion, which gives laws to her condition, and for the power to render them sacred. It is with him to enlarge her education, that she may know her worth, and be able to preserve it. She repays by her sympathy, but she receives from generous virtue. Always the friend of man, she is his slave, his domestic servant, or his bosom friend, at his own discretion. By exalting her, he exalts himself. The kinder forms of educa∣tion, and the most noble thoughts of Love belong to the protection of our Order, in its best designs to advance human happiness. A greater re∣proach cannot fall upon a Mason, than that he is a stranger to domestic peace. It is not a want of confidence that has kept our sisters from our asso∣ciation, but the established order of Civil Socie∣ty. The enlightened Brother knows, that if his mind can comprehend his exalted duty, it must be the tenderness of female sympathy which must qualify him to receive it.</P>
<P>A TRUE Brother will always venerate age. He suffers it to lean upon his shoulder. He covers its
<PB N="22" REF="031798_0021_0FEE725C9B448F70"/>infirmities, and assists to remove its cares. It is his glory to enrich age with blessings, to provide its consolations, and to fill it with hope. Its occa∣sional wants he may not always discover, but its natural wants he cannot forget.</P>
<P>A Brother will not be an idle spectator of the world. We live in an age of revolutions. Our institution requires no revolution; but admits our warmest friendship. While every institution professes to collect new force, it is in our power to rise with glory. Our principles are just, and are eternal. They regard the highest virtues of enlightened society; but they exist in minds con∣stantly developing. Their truth is eternal; but may be more clear. They may enjoy a brighter sky. The wisdom of each generation may be like the mildness of our climate, the more visible, the longer it is inhabited. May it not then be said, that it must afford us the greatest pleasure, as Brethren, in having contributed to the honor of the Craft, by personal merit, and the reputation of our Lodge.</P>
<P>A YEAR had not clapsed, after Masonry had been welcomed to New England, before New Hampshire was blessed with its light. So congen∣id in its character with Massachusetts, and emulous
<PB N="23" REF="031798_0022_0FEE7260B1B31178"/>of all its advantages, this State concurred in the design of giving support to Masonry. The bands of union have ever been firm between these States, and on these solemnities, we trust that we shall as∣sist to perpetuate the friendship. Happy indeed are we to see, beyond any former example in our own country, the two Grand Lodges united in this purpose, and concurring in the consecration of Lodges in their respective jurisdictions.</P>
<P>AS they began together, may they continue united in the common cause. Thus the inter∣course of Brethren pervades the whole Fraternity. Visits to the Lodges, and the presence of Lodges with each other at celebrations, are now proved to be in the spirit of the institution. May this union of our Grand Lodges be one of the happy events which shall prepare for a representation of the order through the world.</P>
<P>FROM the undissembled joy, good order, and harmony of the Brethren, we may congratulate our Brethren of the Lodge this day consecrated, upon their opening prospects.</P>
<P>To our brother elected as Master of this Lodge we may give our friendly salutation. It is the highest glory of God to be loved, by those whom he protects. We love him, because he first loved
<PB N="24" REF="031798_0023_0FEE726380C1D130"/>us. A faithful Master will have our affections, and in them has the highest honors we can render him.</P>
<P>YE Watchmen, who guard our Temple, we sa∣lute you. Perpetual are the blessings of the Sun, whether he shine in the west or the south. He declines, but he turns a full orb of light to the world. He sets to rise again with his wonted vig∣our. We know his course, and are satisfied.</P>
<P>YE attendant Lights, we bless you. If ye serve not as ministers at every hour, your order makes nature perfect.</P>
<P>HEAVEN has its records and its treasure. The pure mind keeps the first, but the eldest Bro∣ther keeps the last. He was tried, and found faithful. May the same benevolence and fidelity possess the heart of him who keeps your deposit.</P>
<P>BRETHREN,</P>
<P>WE sincerely rejoice with you on the present occasion. The duty and the dignity of our order has been our theme. Your virtues can outspeak description, and by becoming what ye ought to be, ye will prove to the world, that TRUE MASONS ARE THE MOST ENLIGHTENED, AND THE MOST BENEVOLENT OF MEN.</P>

<P>IN obedience to which, I now come forward on this, to some of us, at least, joyful occasion; to acknowledge, with gratitude, the honor you do us by your company, and the pleasure we feel in having your countenance on this occasion; and to assure you that we shall always endeavor to de∣serve your favorable opinion. For myself, I shall make no apology, lest I should share the fate of most apologizers on similar occasions, that is, of
<PB N="4" REF="031798_0026_0FEE726D1DC809E8"/>having my sincerity questioned, instead of engag∣ing the candor of my audience.</P>
<P>OUR Society claim the honor of being ancient as any among men; and of being extended as far as the civilized world: and we glory in the thought, that no Lodge of Masons was ever just∣ly chargeable with attempting to raise disturbances in church or state.</P>
<P>INFLUENCED by principles of benevolence, we wish a decrease of misery, and an increase of happiness to all mankind; not confining our views to particular friends, nations or countries, but ex∣tending our good will to all nations, countries and languages. We wish to see peace on earth, while we feel good will to all men.</P>
<P>THE Lodge now constituted in this public manner is distinguished by the name of THE BE∣NEVOLENT LODGE: and the grand principle of Masons is <HI>brotherly love;</HI> and every practice incon∣sistent herewith, is abhorrent to their feelings, while those which are calculated to increase the general felicity are congenial with their most ar∣dent wishes.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="031798_0027_0FEE726EA5B7AB90"/>
THE Fraternity of Free and Accepted Masons present, of whatever rank, will permit me to con∣gratulate them on this auspicious day, and unite with them in supplicating that no misconduct of the <HI>Benevolent Lodge</HI> may ever cast a gloom upon it. Our country affords an ample field of em∣ployment to speculative minds. But a few cen∣turies past, it was wholly inhabited by savage beasts, or more savage men. Now, millions of civilized men are spread over it. Our ancestors, often in danger of being destroyed in their youth∣ful state, were as often, almost, miraculously pre∣served; till they arrived at mature age; when they were obliged to vindicate their rights, with the sword and bayonet, against the parent state. But thanks to that kind providence, without the notice of which not a <HI>sparrow</HI> falls to the ground, and by which the <HI>hairs</HI> of our heads are all num∣bered; they supported a dangerous war; ob∣tained an honorable peace; established their rights on a firm basis; and we may now <HI>sit every one under his own vine and figtree and have none to make us afraid.</HI> Happy we may be if we under∣stand our own interests, and have virtue enough to pursue them.</P>
<P>WE have now a right to claim rank among the nations of the world. We enjoy prosperity
<PB N="6" REF="031798_0028_0FEE727186C0D9F0"/>which few others know; and if we are not want∣ing to ourselves, may continue a happy people. For these favors we ought to acknowledge with gratitude that providence which extends through creation; that providence which improved our illustrious Brother WASHINGTON in conducting the war; and since that, at the head of our civil government: In both which he has established a reputation which does honor to our Craft, to his country, to human nature; and which cannot be fullied by the tongues of slander, nor exalted by the pens of panegyrists.</P>
<P>EVENTS that are future are in a great degree hidden from our knowledge; but it requires no spirit of prophecy to determine that within a century or two more, this country will be populous as most of the countries in Europe; and if not equal in wealth, vet before them in the means of real happiness.</P>
<P>IN this State, we have a striking display of the increase of population. But little more than half a century since, to wit, at the time of the settlement of the Rev. Mr WILKINS, lately de∣deceased; this town did not contain twenty fam∣ilies: and to the north, <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 word" DISP="〈◊〉"/> a single family of <GAP DESC="illegible" RESP="uom" EXTENT="1 span" DISP="〈…〉"/>
<PB N="7" REF="031798_0029_0FEE7178305853D8"/>Rivers, to the settlements in Canada; except a few on the banks of those Rivers. There are now, perhaps, an hundred towns, containing from forty or fifty to an hundred and fifty or two hun∣dred families, and the means, not barely of sub∣sistence, but of enjoyment, bear proportion to the rapid increase of inhabitants. What was, within the memory of many now living, a howl∣ing wilderness, is turned to fruitful fields;— what was a frightful desert, now blossoms as the rose. And doubtless in other States more south∣ern, and where there are more inviting advanta∣ges, population and improvement on lands have made a proportionable progress. Well may our country rejoice in the rapidity of her population and improvement, if not too rapid. Well may we of the Masonic Fraternity felicitate ourselves on the prospects before us; and though we urge none to join our society, we may be allowed to hope that the principles of it will be diffused in proportion to the population of our country, and may rest assured that they will be in proportion to the degrees of light and knowledge that are attained by our fellow citizens, whether they join our society or not. Our fervent prayer is, that brotherly love may be universally diffused, and the happiness it is calculated to produce, as uni∣versally enjoyed. And to my Brethren of the
<PB N="8" REF="031798_0030_0FEE727876A51320"/>Fraternity, I may say, that we shall best contribute to this happy purpose, by conducting agreeable to our principles and obligations; to excite us to which, we should consider, that many eyes are upon us beside the all-seeing one; that we are as a city set on a hill, and under indispensable obligations so to order our conversation, at all times, that those who wish to find occasion to speak evil of us, may be ashamed.</P>
<P>THIS assembly in general will permit me to ask them their motives, in coming together at this time. Was it a wish to profit by the public ex∣ercises of the day? If it was, you will not loose your time, if you rightly improve the advice you have had from our worthy monitor of the day; and if you will not do this, you must charge your loss of time to your own negligence, and not to the occasion;—Or was it mere curiosity which brought you together? If it was, we wish you may be as fortunate as Zaccheus of old, who, from the same motive, climb a tree to see our common lord.</P>
<P>HERE, perhaps, some of you will inquire why, if our principles are so noble, and our intentions so benevolent, we do not lay open all our con∣duct to the world, and not have any secrets in
<PB N="9" REF="031798_0031_0FEE727A045F9930"/>our meetings? In this we are not singular; Law∣yers, Physicians, Merchants, and most Mechanics, have their secrets, which they will not disclose to any but such as merit them. But we have more to say: The secrets of our Craft cannot be com∣municated to one who is not a Mason. Should we attempt it, our words would be thought idle tales, and we should not be believed;—that if a man wishes to learn the secrets of Free Masonry, he must become a Mason, as otherwise he can no more understand them than a natural man can discern those things which are only spiritually discerned.</P>
<P>SOME of you, perhaps, have imbibed an idea, that we indulge too much in mirth for our sober professions: Of such I would inquire, whether the christian, who leads a gloomy, sour, morose life, does more honor to his profession than he who leads a cheerful one? We follow reason, which teaches us, that the man who is pleased with his master, and with his service, and feels no guilt on his conscience, has the best right to be merry, and will feel the greatest inclination to it. <HI>Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the up∣right in heart.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="031798_0032_0FEE727CC8779E28"/>
SOME very captious persons may farther object to us, that we admit unworthy members. We submit to the charge, and confess that we have not the means of searching hearts, but are liable to be imposed on; but is not this the case with all other societies? Do not christians of every denomination, with the sublimest precepts, and the brightest example ever given to man, err in the same way? When unworthy persons creep in unawares to our society, we wish they had not been admitted.</P>
<P>MY fair hearers, who honor us with their com∣pany at this time, and add so much to the bril∣liancy of the day, demand particular attention. Methinks I almost hear you inquire why you are not invited to partake of our pleasures, and make a part of our social meetings? It might be asked in return, why you are not chosen govern∣ors, councillors, senators, &amp;c. but this will not satisfy you; I must therefore tell you an honest truth, which I almost blush to own, but of which you are our witnesses; to wit, that in all festive meetings where your sex and ours join, your charms engage so much of our attention, and the pleasure of pleasing you, so entirely engrosses the time, that no serious business is attended to; and, as it would be more mortifying to you to be in
<PB N="11" REF="031798_0033_0FEE727F96499100"/>our company and not the principal objects of our attention; and our meetings are for serious busi∣ness, though softened and enlivened by mirth and hilarity; and we must either deny ourselves the pleasure of your company, or neglect our most important business: we prefer the former, howe∣ever hard the task; and hope you will rather commend than censure us for sometimes attend∣ing to the calis of duty in preference to the al∣lurements of love: especially if at other times you find us as faithful and affectionate husbands, as ardent lovers, as kind parents, as dutiful chil∣dren, as trusty friends, and in all respects as good members of society as other men; and we flatter ourselves you will, on no other occasions, find us behind your warmest admirers.</P>
<P>To this assembly, I beg leave to add;—wheth∣er we can answer to universal satisfaction all the objections that may be brought against us, or not; we are entitled to the same exercise of candor and charity which men in general have a right to expect from their fellow creatures, considering that the right of private judgment is unalienable, and as we have one common master in heaven, so to him we must, each one for himself, finally stand or fall. As we all acknowledge the same rule of faith, and that rule most strongly recom∣mends
<PB N="12" REF="031798_0034_0FEE72825ED2F208"/>that we love one another; let us, laying aside all evil surmises, jealousies, and suspicions, endeavor to conduct towards each other on the present scene of action in such a manner, that our own hearts may not reproach us while we live; and when this drams shall be closed; this world and all things in it be dissolved, and even the solid works of Masonry be involved in the common ruin; may we, through the mercy of the great Architect of the universe, and the merit of the Grand Master of the christian church, be admitted to a seat in that MOUSE WHICH IS NOT MADE WITH MANDS, BUT WHOSE BUILDER AND MAKER IS GOD.</P>
